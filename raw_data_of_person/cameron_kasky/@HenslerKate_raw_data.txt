972179728999297025 2018-03-09 18:38:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Ironically, this is probably the way he would choose to go down. The Donald taken down by a Porn Star the Grand Finale episode. People are saying its going to be so watched that its going to break the TV waves Highest rated show EVeeeeer Believe me ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!
972152819028496384 2018-03-09 16:51:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @Joe_By_Day @kamijane29 @John_Dough44 @catknine @AMATT80 I think I blocked the guy who was being evil. No offense intended to you.

972134208310267904 2018-03-09 15:37:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @IvankaToWorkDay The cons are gonna wish itd been a blue dress.
972133470007975937 2018-03-09 15:34:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @IvankaToWorkDay @CajPaLa Not sure but people do lie about such things either way.
972132773430521858 2018-03-09 15:31:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @NatashaBertrand @kpolantz Sam is a lot of things but afraid of the camera aint one of them.
972132509076086785 2018-03-09 15:30:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @IvankaToWorkDay It may just be she has proof, really nasty gross proof.
972132204569661440 2018-03-09 15:29:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @politico Like Hell!

Hannity and Judge Jeanine have proof of this for the next 12 months as they cart these crooks off to jail.
972117303100887041 2018-03-09 14:30:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence @activist360 @lynn_balcon Lol same here. I used to keep my mouth shut about politics. Needless to say, thanks to trump, Ive totally moved on from there.
972115576612179968 2018-03-09 14:23:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @joenbe @BatNatalie I have to agree. Serious question: exactly what about the modern day republicans is Conservative except for the tax cuts to themselves of course.
972115031654567936 2018-03-09 14:20:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol No Bill that died. The Southern Strategy came with a huge cost. No take-backs.
972113369544224768 2018-03-09 14:14:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxBoot @JacksonDiehl @Dangchick1 @teller_ruth Or anything else for that matter.
972112475075284994 2018-03-09 14:10:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyGervasi @NatashaBertrand What  shocked, NOT SHOCKED!
972112169163743232 2018-03-09 14:09:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @TruckersVote @amybernardalb Honest to goodness, these gun nuts will say anything to protect their precious guns. Im really really tired of it!
972111593172602880 2018-03-09 14:07:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence @activist360 @lynn_balcon Lol Im guessing youre not quite as sensitive these days? Sorry it hurt you though.
972111045694230528 2018-03-09 14:05:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @HouseGOP @RepSwalwell @esquires1215 They cant which is exactly how they want it!
972110218929885185 2018-03-09 14:01:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence @activist360 @lynn_balcon Talk about making a deal with the devil but then, for them, it works because this devil is white and he really like money too, so its a win/win. Yes, many years in the making for sure.
972108908918657024 2018-03-09 13:56:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @Joe_By_Day @kamijane29 @AMATT80 @catknine @Shirley11Wright @10Grean @The_Saucy_Dandy @John_Dough44 Says John Dough, go screw yourself mr non-Christian-christian!
972104649330298880 2018-03-09 13:39:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @Joe_By_Day @John_Dough44 Do you have a source for the number of people who die by knife vs guns in this country? Guns are the third leading cause of death for kids in this country. Where do knifes fall on that continuum?
972103393421549568 2018-03-09 13:34:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @Joe_By_Day @kamijane29 @AMATT80 @catknine @Shirley11Wright @10Grean @The_Saucy_Dandy @John_Dough44 Those are not free societies, in case you were unaware. That is much closer to what you want for your country than what I want. Ill go with England, Sweden, Canada, and Australia. Are you 10?
972102535870808066 2018-03-09 13:31:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @Joe_By_Day @John_Dough44 Tell that to every other civilized country In the world. Countries that really have reasonable gun control dont have these random mass murders. Exactly how do you explain that away? Kooks exist in other countries too.
972101568295309313 2018-03-09 13:27:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @Joe_By_Day @kamijane29 @AMATT80 @catknine @Shirley11Wright @10Grean @John_Dough44 @The_Saucy_Dandy Well they work in every other country in the world but then you dont really care about facts do you?

972100381256945664 2018-03-09 13:22:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @Joe_By_Day @John_Dough44 Nice Cross. In case you havent noticed, while the adults have been solving that problem kids are getting murdered at school. I think theyve earned their voices.
972098284817960965 2018-03-09 13:14:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @RevDrBarber WORD.
972098151455838209 2018-03-09 13:13:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @Dax_x98 He literally makes my skin crawl. Hes a snake.
972097820885909510 2018-03-09 13:12:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Wow you hateful Cons must be so proud of this. Deplorables gonna Deplore.

972089530584100864 2018-03-09 12:39:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @jordanalipscomb @RWPUSA No Richard, that is OVER. Just because you dont like it, doesnt mean its not true. Who exactly in the GOP do you hear agreeing with you? The Cons are right. Youll have to pay to stay.
972088743401312257 2018-03-09 12:36:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Richard, you do realize those are Democratic and NOT Republican positions. RIGHT?

972070766845071360 2018-03-09 11:25:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @aoifectcp @Fahrenthold Hmmmm $$$130,000. He seems to be fond of that number.

972061064304226304 2018-03-09 10:46:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence @activist360 @lynn_balcon Yes me too, but she wont. Shes already cut her deal and the deal is shell go through the motions of being his wife until this is over. Sometimes I truly wonder if she isnt a Russian agent herself.

972050648496828416 2018-03-09 10:05:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence @activist360 @lynn_balcon No woman is cool with her husband screwing a porn star just days after their child is born. Im sure at this point as long as he stays the hell away from her, shes cool with it.
972049158482866177 2018-03-09 09:59:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence @activist360 @iisher Which she seems to positively HATE.

972047555700936704 2018-03-09 09:52:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @TIME AWESOME.

971886398235136000 2018-03-08 23:12:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdKrassen @tenax666 Perhaps so. Obviously for people who are all about the money, there  really isnt enough, EVER!
971885086013644800 2018-03-08 23:07:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdKrassen I agree that DeVoss sucks, but I dont believe its for the money. Shes already filthy rich. I think its her extreme agenda to get $$$ for her crazy Christian schools.

971859089813921794 2018-03-08 21:23:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @SheOfTheMyst I like him and I trust him but I would never vote for him as a Republican. Theres no longer something known as a moderate Republican.
971858651978846208 2018-03-08 21:22:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @SheOfTheMyst Lol I know but really he seems to agree with a lot of Dem positions and not many Republican positions.

971753521044434944 2018-03-08 14:24:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @Rodney_D_Pumas Yea Rush & Rodney, tell that to Willie Horton. Im going with those who supposedly hide behind children and victims over the Cons who clearly hide behind dirty Russians and their rubles.
971751178705960960 2018-03-08 14:15:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @johnlundin Ill bet dolt45 could not name one video game that any of his kids ever played.
971738235578798080 2018-03-08 13:23:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @samstein In the big picture, Id say this is pretty good for trump.
971737961955020800 2018-03-08 13:22:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Are you running as a Republican or a Democrat?

971389900204445697 2018-03-07 14:19:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @justapedn Hadnt thought of that but its certainly possible. Kelly obviously has ZERO respect for trump.  In fact, there seems to be lots of contempt.
971389509089755136 2018-03-07 14:18:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @joncoopertweets Wow thats rich. Something is seriously wrong with Carson. Id bet big money he has some ugly diagnosis that involves brain degeneration.

971386255534632962 2018-03-07 14:05:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomSteyer @tribelaw From a legal standpoint yes, from a common man approach. Its not collusion its conspiracy against our country. Commoners call that Treason.
971385473020170241 2018-03-07 14:01:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes Not if you follow Seth Abramson.

971377923197370368 2018-03-07 13:31:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidJollyFL David, I have new found respect for you as of late. Youve been calling it like it is lately. Whether youve accepted it or not, youre no longer a Con. Proud of you, for being bigger than the label.
971372078183141376 2018-03-07 13:08:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein What the HELL, this gets worse?
971354936700174341 2018-03-07 12:00:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @matthewjdowd Very, not only could he have shot someone in 5th ave, he could have raped someone or paid someone to do either but mess with Cons $$$. & the gloves come off. Very Telling.
971353964401831937 2018-03-07 11:56:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Word. Man am I going to love watching him concede. Texas isnt quite as backwards as the Cons assumed.
971353256436928514 2018-03-07 11:53:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRA @shannonrwatts Omg. I know what Id like to do with that hose.
971353053646544896 2018-03-07 11:53:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @JanzforCongress Ha no kidding. Boy, Look how the high & mighty have fallen. Ow many months & millions did we expend to find out about a BJ. Trumps serving up Stormy & dick pics. Cons say meh. No biggy.
971167261858942976 2018-03-06 23:34:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepSwalwell Sir, Thank you for your patriotism today as you called on Congress to stand up for our Democracy and hold Russia accountable for attacking our freee elections and neutering our great country. trump must be held in check before he gets us into a war to deflect.
971028527867944961 2018-03-06 14:23:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @Angela__Rye @ReignOfApril @angela_rye @donlemon @FRANDO2005 @alicetweet Funny, this isnt really a Denial, is it?

Thats really sad and sick.  Its very telling. No doubt youre Pro Birth and also anti welfare. Yours is a pretty set script. Just another Prosperity Christian.
971025373474541570 2018-03-06 14:11:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @Angela__Rye @ReignOfApril @angela_rye @donlemon @FRANDO2005 @alicetweet Are you saying youre NOT paid by NRA or you dont have to be? In my opinion, its even worse if youre not. Youve shilled for folks who are sanctimonious & dishonest Alice. Surely you dont do it out of the goodness of your heart? Own It, at least.
970932378716852224 2018-03-06 08:01:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @Angela__Rye @ReignOfApril @angela_rye @donlemon @alicetweet @FRANDO2005 No you didnt, Alice just looks normal. Not so much. She most certainly was schilling for the NRA (no doubt she gets a kickback.)
970931480942776320 2018-03-05 07:57:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @Angela__Rye @ReignOfApril @angela_rye @donlemon @alicetweet @FRANDO2005 You were wrong. RW Alice is fairly articulate however her positions are extreme. No surprise she was schilling for the NRA. Just like she shilled for Cruz, Huckabee, Santorum & Bachman. Alice may sound like shes rational but shes not, bless her heart.
970882331140591617 2018-03-05 04:42:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @fantasticlegs Sherry youre deluding yourself. Trump is dirty as crap. He did it, he conspired with Russia to steal the presidency. Isnt it strangetheyre only investigating trump/Russia??? Guilty as SHIT!!!

970694825463951362 2018-03-05 16:17:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @janeworld1 @AddieWoolf Not true. What dealings has trump had with DeVoss, Pruitt, Carson, Pence, Zinke, Perry? None. He has far more past with Putin, Manafort, Stone, Gulliani & Bannon. He was told who to appoint by the Cons and he followed orders. Hes a puppet all right!
970693368090152961 2018-03-05 16:11:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @speckiemom I agree. As soon as I heard what he had done in the past, it was obvious that Dotard would anoint him.
970693028787736580 2018-03-05 16:10:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @Rollende_Steine Funny coming from a Rigt Wing Extremist. How you liking that Fox Faux News? Funny, even they are starting to share some truth.

970671745039589376 2018-03-05 14:45:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @NatashaBertrand @Mister_Fun_Guy STILL, NO DOUBT.
970671435965399041 2018-03-05 14:44:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @NatashaBertrand Gee, do you think that has something to do with why Rexon has not used one penny of the 140 million given to his department to combat Russian cyber attacks? Of course Putin wanted Mr Friend of Russia, Rexon. I hate Cons for ignoring the obvious, every damn day.
970662763482710017 2018-03-05 14:10:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Rexon has been obvious since day one.
970661841025273856 2018-03-05 14:06:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump F U we know the truth Dotard. When you put foreign spies in your campaign, dont be surprised when you get investigated. Managort, Gates, Papadopalous, Flynn??? F U trump.

Obama warned trump not to put Flynn in at NSA but of course he did because they were both totally compromised.  Guilty as sin.

969277901228175360 2018-03-01 18:27:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @tgosherry Were trying but its an uphill battle. Northern Cal is beautiful.
969277499766181888 2018-03-01 18:25:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @tgosherry Yea it is that! And generally people are nice and its very affordable.
969276359297118208 2018-03-01 18:21:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @tgosherry I like your senators/Gov quite a bit. My senators are McConnell and Paul and the Gov is Bevin. Would you like to trade? Theyre busy trying to take away healthcare, gerrymander, give huge tax credits to rich and business and cut services for the poor Great Guys!
969273087215767554 2018-03-01 18:08:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @tgosherry I suspect if hed said politicians should .....many would have come back with, at least Blue states try, etc.
969271309938184192 2018-03-01 18:01:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @tgosherry Im not arguing either. I think hes just acknowledging that Red States dont ever make this a priority and blues give it lip service but need to work harder at it.
969269687166136320 2018-03-01 17:54:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @tgosherry Heavens no, its not better in places governed by republicans. In general, red states are poor and where people are poor, POC are poorer.  Some folks havent accepted that the South lost that battle(only kind of kidding).
969261514883567617 2018-03-01 17:22:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @tgosherry Yes he did, I dont get your point.
969260894533423104 2018-03-01 17:19:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @tgosherry I dont see where he said blue vs red. These are things that Dems would care about and focus on, or should. Cons, not so much.

968978687617126403 2018-02-28 22:38:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @NancyPelosi Please Nancy Get rid of him while we still have a country!!!
968977977445896192 2018-02-28 22:35:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @MichaelSLinden No not just you Michael. Sometimes the MSM bends over backwards to show both sides a little too much. How we got saddled with rump.
968976258964099080 2018-02-28 22:28:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @UnkleNeal @FoxReports Lol Perfect
968971562639675392 2018-02-28 22:09:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @TDPattillo She was some pretty nice eye candy.

968963628568317952 2018-02-28 21:38:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Wow this seems huge.
968960458161119232 2018-02-28 21:25:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @jackiecall3 @cmclymer Yea except his kid is probably smart, so its way worse than that.
968959959525453824 2018-02-28 21:23:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Voize_of_Reazon Lol he is really pretty slow for Stable Genius.
968947848497762304 2018-02-28 20:35:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @tonyposnanski Really, hes definitely not right in the head.
968944925038514176 2018-02-28 20:24:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @idkhillary @RodneyMunch80 @bogucki_john Lol makes sense! Is a troll and actual person and a bot is automated?

968928938385969154 2018-02-28 19:20:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @idkhillary @RodneyMunch80 Youre mean and dumb.
968898768316674048 2018-02-28 17:20:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheGoldWaterUS @Maggieb1B Yea but theyre reserving space for trump and his band of crooks!

968888594223042561 2018-02-28 16:40:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @JackPosobiec Idiot with Fake Facts. Bush chose Mueller. Obama extended his term because he thought he was very good. Which he is. Sorry to say for the bad guys.
968887353296216064 2018-02-28 16:35:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Well you are an EXPERT ON DISGRACEFUL.
968866784483921920 2018-02-28 15:13:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryWarnedUs Im in too.
968866675121639424 2018-02-28 15:13:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @dkelliher1321 Do you think an abortion could be performed on him, removing that over-sized evil demon inside of him?
968866157448060928 2018-02-28 15:11:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @MrDane1982 Wow!
968842914943127552 2018-02-28 13:38:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @marcorubio I can come up with over 3 million reasons why everything you say is a crock of crap. Save it!
968821919071064065 2018-02-28 12:15:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @ShimonPro Too early knew
968820890594050053 2018-02-28 12:11:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @ShimonPro No Shit. Is there really anyone who New he hosted the NRA at the White House who didnt know that? Crooks Meeting Crooks. Donny then says the NRA is on our side. NRA (Not Really American)
968672830752722944 2018-02-27 02:22:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @VABVOX Yep, still good!
968668413940961280 2018-02-27 02:05:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytimes @putinsgay Yes Ive read that shes very involved and also that his son has gotten contracts as well. Grifters gonna grift. This Shit Show cant end soon enough.

968581531106148352 2018-02-27 20:20:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @SRuhle TREASON TREASON TREASON TREASON
968549776513028096 2018-02-27 18:13:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @cherokeesher2 @billyeichner Hows the Glam Squad? Great idea. Friend of the Pod too. The homosexual couples Ive known, though unorthodox, theyve been great parents and families. Of course, theyve worked hard to get their kids, they didnt just happen. The Religious Right is Wrong. RESIST. Its HATEFUL.
968533090112081921 2018-02-27 17:07:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @stonecold2050 I suppose we could name quite a few specifics. Racism, their husbands careers, Christian faith but really the common thread is MONEY.
968529689412341761 2018-02-27 16:54:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Yea not a stretch, is it? Look at the guy, flipping troll!

968508792722919425 2018-02-27 15:31:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @jdice03 You can pretty much see steam coming out of his empty head.
968506822205288449 2018-02-27 15:23:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @AroqueApparel @RepAdamSchiff Were proud of it too!!!

968496626343075845 2018-02-27 14:42:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @AusAntiLeft @znvalentine Yea grandma pedophile, good one.
968495730825617408 2018-02-27 14:39:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @AusAntiLeft @znvalentine Yea thats false.
968495455574339586 2018-02-27 14:38:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @AusAntiLeft @znvalentine Ps you look like a total red neck. No surprise there.
968495136383623168 2018-02-27 14:36:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @AusAntiLeft @znvalentine Youre obviously not interested in truth. Read something real and youll know. Im not wasting my time on you.
968494636372254720 2018-02-27 14:34:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @projeKCtion @wesley_jordan Of course he knew, thats what he thought was so cute. His little secret joke. How many times did he talk about Wikileaks?
968494176420745217 2018-02-27 14:33:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @AusAntiLeft @znvalentine Yea thats it. Nothing on Manafort, Gates, Flynn, Papadopolues. Just a coincidence, Im sure.
968492081961488384 2018-02-27 14:24:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @AusAntiLeft @znvalentine Patience is a virtue. Its coming,but then you dont want to hear that do you? Its so obvious that he did it. Of course he F***ing did it. You just dont care.
968491182983655425 2018-02-27 14:21:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @brithume @Bothered_Blonde Recent research indicates that brain development and therefore full maturity isnt completed until the age of 25 but then you folks arent really into science and research are you? Nope, you just make yours up to fit your sad narrative. Exactly what purpose do AR -15a serve?
968489883298869254 2018-02-27 14:15:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @brycetache Not me, it took me awhile but the disbelief is over. Its a fact and Ive accepted it.
968489560933052424 2018-02-27 14:14:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @WalshFreedom Youre an ass. I guess thats your right too.
968488373781434368 2018-02-27 14:09:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @ResistWitch @OccupyWallStNYC GROSS.
968487183626784768 2018-02-27 14:05:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @ev3ponies Digging pretty deep here. Just look at Virginia to see whos turning out to vote. Hes screwed!
968485476008103936 2018-02-27 13:58:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @AngelinaSnow007 @cmclymer Really wtf, Joe?
968480963981447168 2018-02-27 13:40:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahsMimi @RepJerryNadler Yea sir, its been awful. FYI, we do appreciate you as a strong and decent leader.
968480244599525377 2018-02-27 13:37:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @MsAnneBoleyn But, but, but her emails
968479151131971584 2018-02-27 13:33:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson Lol thats pretty good.

968476393133826048 2018-02-27 13:22:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @marthamaccallum @judgenapolitano @realDonaldTrump Bahahahaha Judge Politano!!!!

968471763310071808 2018-02-27 13:03:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @B52Malmet @NikitaKitty Claire is awesome. We need to do everything we can to keep@her in office. Shes smart and honest. She must stay.
968470966216007681 2018-02-27 13:00:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @DerekCressman He is such a crook.
968470067510939649 2018-02-27 12:57:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @zeligzev @JRubinBlogger Seriously, do you get death threats because his base is really crazy. I always agee with what you say.
968469605609025536 2018-02-27 12:55:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @B52Malmet @NikitaKitty These guys are total Nut Jobs. I cant even imagine if this stuff actually happened, it would be a nightmare. But the Kocks sure would make a lot of money, wouldnt they?
968466231379537921 2018-02-27 12:41:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @united @AnnCoulter @iVoteAmerica @MikeC1163 @JWSNMNJ And kill.
968465570793492480 2018-02-27 12:39:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind What you mean theyre not raising  salaries and hiring new employees? Tuck Frump.
968462456560541696 2018-02-27 12:26:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @brithume @Bothered_Blonde 19 year old adult? Cant drink, cant buy cigarettes, I sure as hell wouldnt rent my house to him. Rental car companies wont rent him a car. Apparently your idea of an adult is not universal.
968461812608962560 2018-02-27 12:24:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @brithume Like hell the NRA is most certainly complicit in this crime. 100%.
968460754088349696 2018-02-27 12:20:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @SeldenGADawgs @brithume @127bama We do blame bartenders and bars for over serving customers who drive drunk and get in accidents so theres that. But you dont want real responses right?
968457837864210432 2018-02-27 12:08:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC What a joke Joe. Using the lack of shame in the Clinton WH to compare to trumps WH lack of shame. RIDICULOUS. Clinton got a BJ. Trump conspired with Putin to steal the presidency. Do those seem equally shameful to you?
968454304595144705 2018-02-27 11:54:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @dailykos @SethAbramson You were right Seth, he said all that needed to be said.
968276330071683072 2018-02-26 00:07:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @katezdorf @HuffPostPol Hes such s turd. The Cons have no standards what so ever. Its gross.
968273494789193728 2018-02-26 23:56:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @RBReich When I get down in the dumps about trump and the Cons, I look at what good has been born from that nightmare. I see a lot of good coming in the not too distant future.
968272276524355584 2018-02-26 23:51:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomSteyer @SenFeinstein @BernadetteMhill Senator Feinstein is 84 years old. Shes awesome but really, isnt it time for new blood? I wish shed just gracefully chose not to run. Shes had a lot of good years in politics, its time.
968269220843843584 2018-02-26 23:39:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @POLITICOMag @politico Im not sure why I actually read this BS. Gates has the goods to sink his ass and hes singing.
968266882536083458 2018-02-26 23:29:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @ConorLambPA @islandlady712 No doubt in my mind.
968233295308828672 2018-02-26 21:16:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill How dumb!
968232148003115009 2018-02-26 21:11:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRA @Delta @CaseyCagle Is that one of your favorite terrorist organizations?
968185672149405696 2018-02-26 18:07:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @treasonstickers He also really believed when Putin said they didnt commit cyber attacks on us!
968175231260090369 2018-02-26 17:25:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheView @MaryAbrahams @SunflowerSoul71 Same here so Im sure were not alone!
968165432346775553 2018-02-26 16:46:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheView @MaryAbrahams @SunflowerSoul71 Yea I wont be voting for Gillibrand unless she gets the ticket. Certainly not my first pick. Apparently our country like men who take liberties so maybe Franken should run. Id still vote for him. That stuff seemed like bull to me.
968164280603430912 2018-02-26 16:42:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheView @MaryAbrahams @SunflowerSoul71 So do I and Im still with her too, For Sure.  I guess I was just playing devils advocate. Hillary should not hear word one about that!
968163826100326400 2018-02-26 16:40:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheView @MaryAbrahams @SunflowerSoul71 Well Im very impressed with how mature and strong those young people are. Kids grow up very fast these days. I guess being shot at in school will do that;(
968163075353337856 2018-02-26 16:37:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheView @SunflowerSoul71 @MaryAbrahams Oh I think she liked him too but the power/age differential was huge. She was 22 and he was 49. Perhaps not a #MeToo moment but far from appropriate in my mind.
968160298518577152 2018-02-26 16:26:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheView @MaryAbrahams @SunflowerSoul71 Yea know Im not sure I agree here and Im a card carrying liberal. She was pretty young at the time and he was the president so....
968159874197741568 2018-02-26 16:24:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhiteHouse @williamlegate @NBChristinaGinn So WEAK.
968159787534995456 2018-02-26 16:24:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @B52Malmet Lol I love your mom. I bet Id just laugh and laugh if I got to hear in person. Shes like the fruitcake lady! Hilarious.
968159124407115777 2018-02-26 16:21:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 Omg too darn bad about those bone spurs then. If he ran in there Im pretty sure hed need oxygen.
968158532444057600 2018-02-26 16:19:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 @Castantine Yea theyre not really into truth supported by facts. They like alternative facts.
968150799380631553 2018-02-26 15:48:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @GrimTweeter1 @Cheetohjesus4 Hes a idiot blowhard, I know Im jealous!!!
968147671558049793 2018-02-26 15:36:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyGervasi @lynnv378 @IndigoGrrlStill What works in California and Connecticut just doesnt work in these Red/purple states. Maybe someday, but certainly not today, unfortunately!
968147259186647040 2018-02-26 15:34:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyGervasi @lynnv378 @IndigoGrrlStill And we do need one like that , we need all the Dems that can get elected, whether we think theyre perfect or not. The alternative is a RW Extremist! He just needs to be smarter about his ads. The Extremists have successfully brainwashed their followers  with this crap.
968146410326712321 2018-02-26 15:31:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyGervasi @lynnv378 @IndigoGrrlStill Yes he is a Dem. I understand why hes say it because the Cons have so effectively demonized Pelosi but he needs to own it. If nothing else, trump has taught us that. A woman tried to challenge MCConnell for Senate last time, shed never say she voted for Obama. Ridiculous!
968126194108465153 2018-02-26 14:10:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyGervasi @lynnv378 100% Agree! I still hope he wins but he clearly has a lot to learn. This Dem is tired of being a damn doormat!
968125234174922752 2018-02-26 14:06:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyGervasi @lynnv378 I disagee. Dems are stronger now, we need to own it. He doesnt have to support her but saying he doesnt is wimpy and a mistake and Id love to see him win and Ive given to the cause. Women get that!
968124518349922304 2018-02-26 14:04:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyGervasi @lynnv378 I agree. Hes either a Dem or hes not. He doesnt have to swear his allegiance but saying that, stupid.
968123319739351041 2018-02-26 13:59:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @refusedone @alt_jabroni So Gross.
968122637540085762 2018-02-26 13:56:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen Total bull shit! Id bet $1000 that Ivanka has totally seen him in action. Trump would have no hesitation to show his sexual prowess when she was around. You can take that to the bank! I can just hear her in that fake Robot Barbie voice oh daddy, youre So BAD.
968120972900487168 2018-02-26 13:50:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @Rangerlora Nothing about trumps GOP is conservative that term died with him and God yes, its terribly racist.

968117932193648642 2018-02-26 13:37:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 Oh
968117877738962944 2018-02-26 13:37:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 Why should Israel resign?
968117678366961666 2018-02-26 13:36:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 Well thats crazy, kill the NRA is not kill the NRA members. Youre very easily lead astray Sam. Glad to see Virginia has seen the light though.
968117158059397120 2018-02-26 13:34:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 Looked back at some of your tweets, youre pretty whacked out! Carson should have a holiday named after him? Lets call it the lost my marbles but still know how to graft for me and my family holiday.
968116540804620289 2018-02-26 13:32:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 If I could Id take every last gun and melt them down and do something worthwhile with all of the metal. Americans need to evolve past this BS. The # of people who die here because of guns is CRAZY. Its uncivilized.
968115803471179776 2018-02-26 13:29:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 I guess you meant this tweet? Yes youve been brainwashed. Sorry. Four armed dudes stood outside and waited? I guess they didnt feel safer?
968114879851884544 2018-02-26 13:25:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 Lol yes I support it!!! Have a good day. I appreciate your civility.
968114573772578816 2018-02-26 13:24:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @MichaelSteele News flash: Many In the GOP ARE RACISTS. That is precisely what many of them like about trump. You need to come to the big tent. Well welcome you just As you are. Are your taxes really the most important thing to you? Matt acted just as I would have expected! :(
968111988638408704 2018-02-26 13:14:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 Im sure that youre not and many gun folks are good people. I live in KY so guns are everywhere. My dad was an eye surgeon, he saw a lot of gun injuries. I would never allow a gun in my home. GOP/NRA has brainwashed people into thinking theyre safer with guns. Its NOT true.
968110570477154310 2018-02-26 13:08:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 Yes its BS. Written at a time when we had no police. Modern interpretation is most certainly BS.  The NRA purchasing the GOP has been a Scam of epic proportions. They can stick their fake thoughts and prayers. The only way to control the guns is to control the guns, period.
968104602565570560 2018-02-26 12:44:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @chloe_614 @ReeceDiane @sburry17 @Driveshard75 Many of these crazy gun people are threatening. Whether theyre NRA members or not is irrelevant, isnt it. They basically tell you what theyll do with their guns if anybody comes for them. The NRA has created monsters with their BS 2A rights.
968103196341276672 2018-02-26 12:39:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @RebeccaMorin_ @politico How many hours a week do you suppose Jevanka see their precious children?

967955670443151360 2018-02-25 02:53:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Wow Nothing is sacred. Its sick.
967941352154718208 2018-02-25 01:56:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenFeinstein @butch3fan70 @morganarae We need to have more respect for our elders in our party or well end I like the Repugs turning on McCain and other mainstream politicians.
967938314417459200 2018-02-25 01:44:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 Word saladdoesnt really do this justice. Its more like Word Vomit.

967934202376310784 2018-02-25 01:27:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @AuthorKimberley @Alyssa_Milano Gross who would allow their child to be in this picture.
967931924592381954 2018-02-25 01:18:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @bhsnitzer Insurance that is limited for services and even with the adjunct providers, its difficult to be seen.
967907182707699712 2018-02-25 23:40:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @woulfmann @ProudResister You both look very happy! Thats fantastic. Love does win
967818980131004417 2018-02-25 17:50:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson I am really tired of F***ing Fake Facts. Cons have decided you can just make up your own facts and their followers dont seem to know the difference. Facts are Facts. Facts are not Fake. Fox is Fake.
967759395877736450 2018-02-25 13:53:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @MichaelSteele @ritaINK @FlipthehouseUSA @ejgabriel9 @TheRichardSands @JTRJules They wont. This is who they are. I suspect this is who theyve been for a long time. Theyve just embraced being loud and proud GROSS.
967758675757723648 2018-02-25 13:50:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @MichaelSteele Michael theyve shown you who they are (many times no doubt)if you stay, you deserve what you get. Matt is not your buddy, these are bad people who really only care about their own money. If you stay, youll deserve what you get. Matts a phony, are you?
967586925707169797 2018-02-24 02:27:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @MeghanMcCain @sfm_42 Mrs McCain is worth way more than he is. He could have retired many, many years ago. Meghan isnt my favorite but the Senator has earned some respect.
967584047902920704 2018-02-24 02:16:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @mschlapp Matt youre a turd. Senator McCain has earned much better than you Deplorables give him. You deserve traitor trump #MAGAt
967583389699231749 2018-02-24 02:13:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @LiberalMmama @MeghanMcCain Meghan those people are deplorable, just like she said. Even though your dad is on the other side of the aisle, we Dems have a lot of respect for him. So sad that his own party has betrayed him. He deserves much, much better.

967526503050301440 2018-02-24 22:27:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @williamlegate Lol thats pretty funny.
967526294597636098 2018-02-24 22:26:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidaxelrod And maybe a little extra more and then they could cook and clean and we could close kitchens and get rid of Millers least favorite the janitors.
967524053144743938 2018-02-24 22:18:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @FedEx @GeorgeTorresNYC @davidhogg111 A lot of high end goods are shipped via FedEx.
967515832950632449 2018-02-24 21:45:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson No surprise there but looking forward to your professional read on it. Thanks Seth.
967514067849109505 2018-02-24 21:38:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @DevinNunes @kurteichenwald Nunes is guilty as shit and he has had dealings g with the damn Russians too. Thats why hes been so unhinged.
967508806455513088 2018-02-24 21:17:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @NatashaBertrand Youre kidding. Whats your read? Youre awesome Natasha. Keep up the great work!
967507979527475201 2018-02-24 21:14:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @Emma4Change Im sure youve heard it a many times but thanks for being one in a million. Truly inspiring. Keep calling BS. We need you and we are with you.
967507137260851200 2018-02-24 21:10:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidhogg111 David you are wise and strong beyond your years. Youre an inspiration. Im really glad youve joined the Resistance.

The racist haters are now loud and proud. How Blacks or POC vote for them Ill never know, or women, or Muslims, or LGBTQ,  or Jews, or union members, or poor people, or sick people....
967502971260071943 2018-02-24 20:54:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @MichaelSteele @accidntlmystic @RepSwalwell Poor Michael has been and good and faithful Republican and theyve treated him with as much respect as they have their long time hero, John McCain. Loyalty is DEAD in the GOP.
967500322766770177 2018-02-24 20:43:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @sweetlifephoto @brycetache Its so inspiring. Theyve been the target of all of this gun safety too many times. Id be really pissed too. Can you imagine hiding in a crammed closet as you here a machine gun coming your way? I am pissed too!
967499249452756992 2018-02-24 20:39:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein Absurd to even say it.
967498814029516800 2018-02-24 20:37:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @TDPattillo Yes just like the Fierce Floridians we call BS.
967487983283834881 2018-02-24 19:54:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarionBurr5 @williamlegate Awesome because I didnt want to have to give them up.
967475894154604546 2018-02-24 19:06:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mikel_Jollett Theyre pretty quick with the very thinly veiled threats, anybody comes after my guns, there gonna know exactly how I feel about it BLOCK.
967410894123696129 2018-02-24 14:48:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein Tip of the Iceberg here, but a very nice start. #RESIST.
967405607467847680 2018-02-24 14:27:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidAFrench Calling Loesch a murderer. How many people have died because she effectively shills for NRA? Kind of like calling Charles Manson a murderer.
967405277036326912 2018-02-24 14:26:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidAFrench David I saw you on CNN this AM. Im guessing if youd been shot at with a AF like a sitting duck youd have a little more sympathy for the kids who were. Calling Loesch is not much of a stretch- she is a despicable human being making big bucks off of hatred and division. NRA OUT.
967404197913284608 2018-02-24 14:21:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 She is really just so awful. Why is it that all Of the conservative women seem like theyre demon possessed. Pirro, Ingram, Coulter, Loesch. Strange considering Im sure theyre all card carrying Christians.

967400148954476544 2018-02-24 14:05:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @WayneDupreeShow Just because its ok doesnt mean its not dumb as hell! Just ask Michael Steele.

Its just what they say to Fight for gun rights Im so over that BS. My right to life trumps there damn gun rights
967371696855506945 2018-02-24 12:12:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @JackKingston Youre an idiot. Gates pleaded guilty because he is guilty. Ive read where folks new who/what Manafort was for years. Your Chump is going down. Will you blame trumps finances when he falls? When do you get real and see it for what it is. TREASON.
967264565510725633 2018-02-23 05:06:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidaxelrod That is exactly right Sir.
967254921115467776 2018-02-23 04:28:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @PreetBharara Well he better pack his bags because trump will give him the boot if he does. Then again, Im not so sure Kelly wouldnt be relieved.
967253116474286082 2018-02-23 04:21:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @guapofalbq @TeamPelosi Just part of that huge blue Wave. Cant come soon enough.

967252005969416193 2018-02-23 04:17:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes I remember not too long ago you said you didnt really believe that trump did it. I was surprised to hear you say it because Ive been sure for a long time. Hes Guidry as sin. They all are. Many Cons in congress too. Its huge.
967250754137403392 2018-02-23 04:12:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @wsbtv @Pie_SocialMedia @NicoleCarrWSB Those Price doctors should both be in jail. Theyre crooked creeps.

967080272171761665 2018-02-23 16:54:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @BobEisenhauer Undoubtedly No, he has not.
967078547192975360 2018-02-23 16:47:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @SteveSchmidtSES Theyre cheering for the head of your party Steve. ENJOY!!! Sorry, but its the truth.
967075855569686528 2018-02-23 16:37:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahsMimi Lucky for you youre in Connecticut. Theyre still pretty rational there, not So here in Kentucky.
967075115015049216 2018-02-23 16:34:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol @electpaulmartin No they will not. If you believe that, youre not paying very close attention. The horse has left the barn.
967074113603948544 2018-02-23 16:30:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarionBurr5 @BillKristol Thats nice but really Bill, that isnt working. Isnt it time that you stand up and join the Jolly camp. You cant change what you dont acknowledge. Cain is dying (sadly) and so is his party. Trump has profoundly dirtied your so -called conservative movement. It too is DEAD.
967072991350751232 2018-02-23 16:25:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahsMimi @JoyAnnReid He is the ultimate F**k Face. I leterally Hate His Lying evil guts.

967043901478629378 2018-02-23 14:30:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @essenviews He has that same gross mouth.
967043153126674433 2018-02-23 14:27:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie And conservatives should be ashamed of themselves because really, they let themselves get sucked up into this vortex of shit. They knowingly made a deal with Treasonous trump and they will pay accordingly.
967042422978109441 2018-02-23 14:24:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @pontussorlin @davekarpf Well that and buying off the GOP.

966826925208555522 2018-02-22 00:07:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @SusResister No surprise, these people value their darn guns over everything. Theyre demented and dangerous.
966769498073325568 2018-02-22 20:19:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MikePJD No I dont, thats my point.
966742396104003584 2018-02-22 18:32:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MikePJD You just embraced offering expensive shitty plans in the name of making it affordable. I suggest improving care by regulating service and cost of medical treatment and supplies. We are by far the most expensive and ranked like 23rd best. Free market medicine has not worked well.
966738913695076352 2018-02-22 18:18:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MikePJD @smith_lassen @Tom_wymer @VirginiaStark0 Take a look at that picture. If you dont see anything that gives you reason for pause, I can not help you.

966737402629885952 2018-02-22 18:12:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MikePJD I would say you are wrong, universal healthcare is superior. Guess how many of the industrialized nations with U healthcare (all of them) want our system, 0. Thats the only prayer we have of increasing quality of care and decreasing costs. Which is why they all have it!
966735036602114048 2018-02-22 18:02:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou No they dont, not for everyone. Only for the chosen ones, the monied elite. They feel theyve worked hard and they have earned it and to hell with those who havent! They call it taking personal responsibility. Many Prosperity Christians feel his way.
966717304573751297 2018-02-22 16:52:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @Astorix23 And there are plenty of older Progressives who would be proud to stand with you. Please count me in.

966684921199779841 2018-02-22 14:43:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @AshleyRParker @costareports @zeligzev Honest assessment of his cabinet picks clearly shows that hes only appointing those who seek to weaken or destroy the very cabinets they represent. Price, Mulvaney, Pruitt, DeVoss, McMahon, Tillerson. Any doubt?
966680371176886272 2018-02-22 14:25:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @jaketapper @costareports @Sven_Golly7 Yes I can see why, he actually has an ounce of integrity. You people are just so bad!

966679429412982786 2018-02-22 14:21:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @AshleyRParker @costareports @Ford_Prefection No, remember when he went public and shilled for trump. Im guessing trump tried to get him to do it again and he wouldnt. Hes toast.

966675977630814208 2018-02-22 14:08:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Too bad that those who are heavily armed in this country actually support the current tyranny that is taking over our country. So how the hell is that a good thing?
966675234672857089 2018-02-22 14:05:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Trump needed a cheat sheet to make it through a listening session with children. If thats your idea of success Joe, well that says how low youve set your bar. All so that he could push for teachers with guns? Really Joe, hes a pitiful excuse for a human being.
966672403391803392 2018-02-22 13:53:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @AoDespair @OleHippieChick In light of his obvious disregard for safe sex and penchant to bed porn stars and bunnies you are probably right.

966670646678900737 2018-02-22 13:46:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @AoDespair @pierrotspeaks Well, based on what that so called physician (active duty???) had to say about it, Im pretty sure he was following orders.

Same party cutting funds to everything (including education) except govt travel. Where the hell do you think all of that money would come from?

965758428634378246 2018-02-19 01:22:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @dopemamapdx Ive thought this many times. Exactly why do they think this is bad?
965746794369028096 2018-02-19 00:35:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jamie_Weinstein Not surprising really.
965746226099556353 2018-02-19 00:33:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @bellvisuals So sorry to hear that. Bostons are really cool dogs.

965697462823538688 2018-02-19 21:19:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @DawnMacc @MaxBoot Honestly its as though there are absolutely no standards what so ever.
965675785964138497 2018-02-19 19:53:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @pwgaines Rs have profited from using State tv, having no ethical standards, flaming racial tensions, using God to support their positions  and so much more. I know Dems arent perfect but there is no real comparison. They also benefit form very low info voters, denying facts & science.
965601258647293953 2018-02-19 14:57:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @yvonne_erdmann @davidfrum @chrissiania I gave them the benefit of the doubt for a long time. In light of how they treated HRC with phony investigations and now the schilling for trump it seems painfully obvious theyre profoundly corrupt.
965599836719509505 2018-02-19 14:51:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @yvonne_erdmann @davidfrum @chrissiania Sorry to say I dont agree. In my opinion, this has been true for a long, long time. They just used to try and hide it better.
965595743162654720 2018-02-19 14:35:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @yvonne_erdmann @davidfrum @chrissiania No. Not for the Cons, money over everything.
965595023264899075 2018-02-19 14:32:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @pwgaines What collusion with RU/HRC we you even referring to? Is that being investigated? If any truth to it, Republican Congress & WH would be all over that, are they? Why not? Hmmmm....
965582464340119552 2018-02-19 13:42:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DB_Houston_2017 @GeraldoRivera @checkmate1098 Yes this from the deluded who no doubt watches Fox Faux News or might just be a GD Russian Bot. Both worthless.
965581601672519681 2018-02-19 13:39:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera @ArtieVandelay1 @memx1955 Shut up Steve, how much money and time was wasted on that BS. Were talking Conspiracy against the US by the trump campaign. Really, emails is all youve got? So weak, not to mention trump WH does the same damn thing  with emails every day now. RIDICULOUS.
965578751613571073 2018-02-19 13:28:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @RogerPicardUSA They are a very impressive group of young people. The future is not bright for the Racist Right.
965578409349992448 2018-02-19 13:26:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @williamlegate @mminpgh Probably right, he never does the right thing. Well the students will no doubt use that to their advantage as well.
965574952312344581 2018-02-19 13:13:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @mminpgh @williamlegate Omg no, that will be a total disaster. Theyre going to chew him up and spit him out. I cant wait.
965562933337055232 2018-02-19 12:25:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @pwgaines Well thats obviously not true Philip, you reference known BS conspiracy theories involving Hillary (even those that have been completely debunked) You need some real sources Philip, lay off the Faux Fox News and the like.
965560855248162818 2018-02-19 12:17:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You do know that even the slowest Americans have figured out that you always say the exact opposite of what you believe, right?
965415076256763905 2018-02-18 02:37:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @politico He is so gross.
965410534643335169 2018-02-18 02:19:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @pwgaines You seem to buy into some conspiracy theories. The Rs beat Benghazi to death. Millions of dollars spent for nothing. God knows they would have pressed it if they actually had anything.

965200025172267008 2018-02-18 12:23:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @krassenstein Putin could literally pee in trumps mouth and make him drink it and trump wouldnt have the nerve for that. They have huge leverage on his Deplorable Ass.
965198204378714112 2018-02-18 12:15:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You mean the Con Nut Jobs who investigated stupid emails and Benghazi to the tune of many millions of dollars forgot that one? You be Cra-Cra.
965197771220439040 2018-02-18 12:14:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump This has been completely debunked. Maybe we can get you debunked.

When did the party of morality and Christianity decide that the dude with the very least amount of honesty and integrity was a great choice?
964920225891315712 2018-02-17 17:51:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr Mitch those people have plenty of thoughts and prayers, they need to know that youre actually getting guns of mass destruction off of the bloody street. Put up shut up. You Cons are the kings of Non Response. This will finally take you down. BS on DACA TOO. ONLY TAX SCAM.

964514945395318785 2018-02-16 15:00:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @basemann7 Probably a bot. If not, take that God stuff off of your profile. No truly God loving person could support this evil, vile man. Youll have to choose between your deities.

964465473520795649 2018-02-16 11:44:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @Pajjr2016 Dems need to take a real stand. Their base is much stronger than it was in 16 and were more progressive. We will not get gun nuts ever. We need to weaponize their sick undying fealty to NRA, run ads with kids being shot at. Use their tactics against them!
964320931660353536 2018-02-15 02:10:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @ANTITRUMPMVMT Omg that Pruitt is really one of the worst, and thats saying a whole heck of a lot.

964304512973459461 2018-02-15 01:04:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein @anggrand @nottodayson2020 Yes and it is trumps base to suck on that. Does it make you feel worse? Good it should!
964302204088832000 2018-02-15 00:55:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr Yes prayers and a bunch of empty words. KY is so sick of your pathological lying. You dont even pretend that youll actually do something. Going down McConnell.
964301308256759808 2018-02-15 00:52:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @KitterleCathy Totally gross.
964299293623443456 2018-02-15 00:44:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @BBoxart @Aroyaldmd Yea he did. Many unions backed him. Part of his Im for the common man bullshit routine. Im gonna bring back your jobs crap. Really pretty sad, they should have known better.
964294486779154433 2018-02-15 00:24:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @tkassen Oh he knows, he was around a lot longer than Manafort.
964293465256407040 2018-02-15 00:20:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @marnanel @ELLMEHL Oh poor Leslie, youre going to be very disappointed.
964290550160678912 2018-02-15 00:09:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @Aroyaldmd @BBoxart What dumb-dumb is a huge fan of the unions How he convinced them of them of that Ill never know.
964239586330333187 2018-02-15 20:46:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @AnnieSage @FMoniteau @GrayShadowTech Ummm no, the 30 million dollars explains that.
964223630010998784 2018-02-15 19:43:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @AP @williamlegate @GrettaMaeBert @mariam_khodr @anghunt26 I guess wed have to assume that they were intimidated by the Racist Right and their ever lovin (extremely generous) NRA. Cons run very dishonest ads and the crazy gun nuts believe them. Same folks who believe Fed Up Fox News. Conspiracy Quacks.
964221420120236032 2018-02-15 19:34:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @MassimoFaggioli @maryjoanderson3 Quick question, did you vote for trump?
964202263429468161 2018-02-15 18:18:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @Cernovich @KevasRobert They already do! Just ask dimwit DeVos.
964201624330752004 2018-02-15 18:15:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @AP @williamlegate @GrettaMaeBert @mariam_khodr No its not. The republicans have blocked absolutely every effort for reasonable gun control and pushed less gun control. Its not irrelevant.
964200587716976642 2018-02-15 18:11:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @BarackObama @bannerite Yea between taking folks guns and the Death Panels its amazing anybody lived to see the wonderful day that Orange Julius took office!
964198641954148353 2018-02-15 18:04:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepJoeKennedy Yep, that pretty much sums these despicable people right up.

964179077400756226 2018-02-15 16:46:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @NicolleDWallace Well in their defense, 34% are gone. Lol.
964178141483880448 2018-02-15 16:42:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @FMoniteau Id go more with....its a corrupt politician issue.
964177429299449856 2018-02-15 16:39:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AnalogMom Wont Not Cant.
964176499577446403 2018-02-15 16:36:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnJHarwood Yes bc its not the fact that this troubled youth was able to buy an automatic rifle, its the neighbors/classmates fault. JFC.
964172006299185152 2018-02-15 16:18:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @GabbyGiffords Thank you Gabby!

964166753562628098 2018-02-15 15:57:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @greenfield64 Pruitt is a very bad man.
964166416042790912 2018-02-15 15:56:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @greenfield64 But, but, but Second Amendment. So gross, its just inexcusable. It really blows my mind that so many of the crazy gun zealots are really into Jesus too. Wtf America?
964165907521134593 2018-02-15 15:54:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @FLGovScott @PamBondi @NRA @KevinCentlivre I dont use this word lightly but Pam Bondi is such a c**t!!!
964164598172733441 2018-02-15 15:48:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill I dont believe one word out of the Little evil Elfin mans mouth.
964163463013642240 2018-02-15 15:44:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @immks19 Absolutely not. He will do nothing. He took 30 mil from the NRA. He wont do shit.
964161680967131137 2018-02-15 15:37:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @MassimoFaggioli @maryjoanderson3 Faulty logic again. Ropes kill, plastic bags kill, aspirin kills, cars kill, you can even kill your self by drinking too much water so I guess we should abolish All of them? Just because you disapprove of porn does not put it on the level of guns. Utterly Ridiculous.
964143196640030720 2018-02-15 14:23:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @MassimoFaggioli @maryjoanderson3 Omg omg omg. It does not hold a candle to guns........
964140194223022085 2018-02-15 14:11:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @MassimoFaggioli @maryjoanderson3 Heres some logic for you... guns kill. Porn doesnt. 
964134687798185985 2018-02-15 13:49:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @MassimoFaggioli @maryjoanderson3 Ridiculous. And Im not into porn, at all!

964130555423010816 2018-02-15 13:33:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub @angry_gram Mary, the RNC did not need to vet trump nor did they want to. They knew he was a corrupt fraud. But a win is a win.

964119897382031361 2018-02-15 12:51:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @OhNoSheTwitnt Who do we call about his erratic, extremely aggressive behavior? DC cops? Linsey Graham? McCarthy? Who among us would really be surprised by what he might very well do? Send out a goon squad? Strike NK? Tweet us into a war? Pull out of NATO? We all knew he was not right.
964116752094367744 2018-02-15 12:38:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @annaborchert @wokeluisa @Chris_McGovern Of course they do.

964110779074121729 2018-02-15 12:14:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @williamlegate @BleedingRedDan Omg youre really really really brainwashed.
964109866267807744 2018-02-15 12:11:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @JasonHalle Trump is a f***ing Moron. One honest thing that Rexon said.

964022704721588224 2018-02-14 06:24:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai @ben_engelhart Saw a map on twitter tonight. Turns out those states with most liberal gun laws have highest death rate by guns. KY, as is true in many neg statistics, is pretty high.
964021109074157568 2018-02-14 06:18:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai @ben_engelhart Or maybe shed lose it and accidentally shoot one of her dear students.
964020683612327936 2018-02-14 06:16:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai @ben_engelhart And fewer bears too, at least thats what idiot Betsy DeVos said.

964019221662445569 2018-02-14 06:11:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai @ben_engelhart Omg what a huge infringement ridiculous. Guess what, Florida, no background check!!!
964018669788516352 2018-02-14 06:08:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai @ben_engelhart Yes, youre also a firm believer in a lot of conspiracy theories too so forgive me for not taking you too seriously.
964017630863679488 2018-02-14 06:04:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai @ben_engelhart I said nothing of changing the constitution. I said that the founding fathers certainly did not intend that Americans should be armed with automatic weapons. Modern day interpretation of 2A is bull. It was written when we had no real police/army.
964016522216734720 2018-02-14 06:00:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @ben_engelhart @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai Well thanks for the answer not that I believe the logic is sound.

How many times must we pretend that there is just no solution to this problem. At one point Australia had a gun problem. They passed related laws, bye-bye gun problems. It can be done. Gun ownership is not mandatory. No civilians need auto weapons.
964012066586746880 2018-02-14 05:42:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @ben_engelhart @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai So is that a zero?
964011438711992320 2018-02-14 05:40:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @ben_engelhart @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai How many mass murdered with the acid?
964003283462475777 2018-02-14 05:07:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @ben_engelhart @kurofukai @CakeandIceQueen Omg Im having a problem coming up with the last time there was a mass murder attack using  common household items. What a completely ridiculous comment. You people are not right in the head.
964000566161674240 2018-02-14 04:56:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @ben_engelhart @kurofukai @CakeandIceQueen Its pretty simple really. We need to get rid of all of the damn guns.
963999591732596737 2018-02-14 04:53:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @kenolin1 And the GD GOP.
963998895503265792 2018-02-14 04:50:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @kenklippenstein Typical heartless Republican. God knows he supported his peoples gun rights.
963998211160584192 2018-02-14 04:47:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @ben_engelhart @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai No its not but this country has done nothing but make it easier and more lethal. The whole 2nd amendment misinterpretation is a bad joke. The founding fathers most certainly did not intend for folks to have automatic killing machines tucked under their car seats.
963997208092831745 2018-02-14 04:43:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenCoryGardner @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr @RoyBlunt @bessbell @greengoddess892 @originalovandy @BKsquadx5 Well your obvious party and the NRAost certainly has. Now thats some real crazy for you.

Its treating their mental illness thats causing this? Maybe we should just shoot them so we wouldnt have to deal with their issues.
963994874889625601 2018-02-14 04:34:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Alison_Em @ben_engelhart @CakeandIceQueen @kurofukai Yea youre totally overlooking the GOP in all of this. The NRA would be helpless without their support.
963993450080333825 2018-02-14 04:28:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @stopthenutjob @Warbird_Nut We are the only country on the whole world with this problem. There are way too many guns here. You are wrong.
963992942338822145 2018-02-14 04:26:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @Frialish @Chewcipher @Mercury_Up Bull crap the NRA does not promote the safe use of guns, they simple promote the use of guns and there mass proliferation. When we get rid of the Con crooks in Congress were coming for your guns too.

963810417972862978 2018-02-14 16:21:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChunkyTWshngtn Says the dude that believes Breitbart is an actual news source. Please add me to the list!

963801261891088384 2018-02-14 15:45:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RepMikeRogersAL So Gross.
963800682049556486 2018-02-14 15:42:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 But please dont worry because they are all the best people.

963797412501426176 2018-02-14 15:29:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder SURE.
963796744210350080 2018-02-14 15:27:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC @davidmiller631 Thanks but no thanks. I suppose youre part of the Damn the FBI club. Shameful stuff.pic.twitter.com/Gst02yYhzu
963795010004160513 2018-02-14 15:20:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC @davidmiller631 Got to love the use of our in your last tweet. Is that a GOP DC prerequisite for you guys? Clearly it is. So damn dirty.
963794287170334721 2018-02-14 15:17:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Becke_Davidson Just listening to MSM saying Gowdy wont be so easy for WH to intimidate. No they dont have to, hes already totally on their side. Banjo Boy needs to go with the rest of the complicit Cons.
963793427707187201 2018-02-14 15:13:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC @davidmiller631 Still waiting....
963793015025303552 2018-02-14 15:12:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisChristie @JesseLehrich Do you think he thinks trump needs an over weight washed up crooked NJ Gov to clean things up? God help us, it gets worse every single day.
963791648139431936 2018-02-14 15:06:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @AriFleischer For gods sake,youre a bad joke. Apples and the plague.
963790006107197440 2018-02-14 15:00:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC @davidmiller631 Tell that to Stormy Daniels 
963789742239375366 2018-02-14 14:59:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC @davidmiller631 Muellers investigation is SO far beyond Steele, yet you conspiracy Theorist deniers cling to trying to shut him down. Lets talk about charges against Russian agents Manafort & Gates. About pleas for Russian agents Flynn and Papadopoulus. Fixating on Steele is desperate.
963786819048439813 2018-02-14 14:47:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidmiller631 @ChuckRossDC Oh Daily Caller Man, you hurt my libtard feelings. Reporter and Daily Caller should not be in the same sentence. You want to see me as unhinged have at it. Now whos trolling who?
963785791305670657 2018-02-14 14:43:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC @davidmiller631 Which think tank? SHAME ON YOU.
963784640380227585 2018-02-14 14:38:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC @davidmiller631 More lies David? Last time I checked Great Britain was our ally. But then again, that was BT (before trump). Now, not so much. The mention of trump going there inspires folks to take to the streets. Hes an international Embarrassment. You should be ashamed of yourself.
963783461860532224 2018-02-14 14:34:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC Mr Daily Caller man, if you think Im going to try and convince you, youre even more deluded than I assume you are. Put those two indictments and two plea bargains  in your  pipe and smoke it.  9 Trump folks met with Russians 32 times. Were just not that dumb.
963782400919601152 2018-02-14 14:30:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC @davidmiller631 Exactly which RW extremist nut job think tank are you a part of? Did the tax scam help your bottom line? Sure helped a bunch of GOP in DC, no?
963781879781523456 2018-02-14 14:28:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC @davidmiller631 Total bullshit David. Senator Feinstein just recently stated that nothing has been refuted in the Steele memo. I trust her. Stick your fake patriotic flag pole.
963780965054033925 2018-02-14 14:24:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC Never mind, just saw the reporter at Daily Caller. Are you also a White Supremacist?
963780611528888320 2018-02-14 14:22:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckRossDC You are just wrong. To date, absolutely nothing in Steele doc has been negated, NOTHING. Despite GOP obsession to refute it. Its true, you just cant handle the truth.
963773587386781696 2018-02-14 13:55:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @johnpavlovitz I wish I believed what you said. Its easier than knowing the truth. The truth is that good people do in fact support and defend this awful POS. They believe all of the gross stuff against him is really Fake News. They reject all media sources accept Fox et al. Very Bad Stuff.
963770935043149825 2018-02-14 13:44:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Oh wait, The day is still young. Do Not underestimate trumps ability to throw some more shiny shit at the screen. He is a master at that!

963770012057194497 2018-02-14 13:40:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @Rogerasalways Well I must admit, I probably would be too. Lets get rid of Cult45 and his fellow criminals.
963769506773585921 2018-02-14 13:38:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @Rogerasalways Its not paranoid, its woke. Stay that way, these criminals will stop at nothing to hold on to their precious power. Ive been ready to hit the streets for months. I dont care if many choose not to see what is right before their face.
963768840818757633 2018-02-14 13:36:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @NBCLOU @JoeNBC I get that you had Eric on to talk about opioid crisis but really, no mention of his firing and why? Slanted Much? Really gross coverage Joe.
963768115090939904 2018-02-14 13:33:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT Yea, your Tweet is very misleading Maggie. That is not what Walter said. That is what you chose to hear.
963764526087892992 2018-02-14 13:19:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @WittyApothecary @Cavcounselor All of that playing God bs. As if keeping someone barely alive with machines isnt playing god? Ridiculous. Same idiots who would just as soon fry you as provide fair trials.
963763792692826122 2018-02-14 13:16:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @WittyApothecary @SuzyQuest UU is pretty awesome for those of us who are looking for community and some faith but cant stand all of the dogma.
963760023708028932 2018-02-14 13:01:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff Sir, if you aspire to run for top dog in 2020, and I suspect you do, read the Dem memo. Dems are tired of being abused by these criminals. You want respect, youre going to have to earn it. The time is now, Im not wrong about this. Youll get my vote and a hell of a lot more.

963753282698141697 2018-02-14 12:34:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jim_Jordan You Are a total idiot liar. Taking your little tidbits and trying to make it look like you tea party kooks have something against the FBI. Trump did it you fool and you know it. Your head will roll for this you f **king Fake.

Muslims, immigrants of all varieties, women, LGBTQ,Blacks, poor,facts,people, liberals, intellectuals, journalists, judges, anybody who dares say anything about Cult45.

963457730538336256 2018-02-13 16:59:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind You know its really flipping bad when absolutely nothing shocks you any more.
963426861765287936 2018-02-13 14:57:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC Maybe you could marry that concern with your totally fake concern over the Steele document and someone might believe you.
963424411356450818 2018-02-13 14:47:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @NoahBookbinder Jesus Christ these people are so corrupt it boggles my mind.
963423877077618688 2018-02-13 14:45:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato And yet, some continue to lie through their lying lips....F***face, Mike Pompeo.

963271854235496448 2018-02-12 04:41:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Personally I wonder if its an actual deal or dumb-dumb just knows how bad it would look if they shared the info with the American public. I think Putin uses the releases to troll trump and to remind him that he has been bought and payed for.
963242359294185472 2018-02-12 02:44:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @VABlueBelle17 Omg well thats at least one with some integrity.

962317549907128320 2018-02-10 13:29:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @AriFleischer Youre full of crap. Name the Advisors in Obamas admin who accused of abusing their wives. Lets see, were at 5 now, not including BLOTUS. RIDICULOUS. Obama actually vetted his people. BLOTUS goes with the sleaze balls because hes one too.
962316601545641984 2018-02-10 13:25:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @AshaRangappa_ Yea....not so much.

962310892569456641 2018-02-10 13:02:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @JTMann05 @timbell72 @contrarian11 @RWFRITTE @ELMiKiNGBiNG I sincerely hope you learn to be more discerning of facts before you share your Faux world view with your child.
962310475076833282 2018-02-10 13:01:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @JTMann05 @timbell72 @contrarian11 @RWFRITTE @ELMiKiNGBiNG Completely false EL. You need to get your facts straight. They had FISA  on Page in 2013. FBI started investigation because idiot Papadopolis bragged while drunk to an Aussie agent at a bar in London that he was making deals with Russians. You dont like facts.
962306598814277632 2018-02-10 12:45:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @JTMann05 @timbell72 @contrarian11 @RWFRITTE @ELMiKiNGBiNG Is this the infamous Nunes memo? Bahahahaha

962304361425711104 2018-02-10 12:36:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarkSZaidEsq @dlippman @VictorBlackwell @Christi_Paul @alicetweet Saw you on CNN. Guess your bud Michelle Bachman got the from God. Too bad. PS mustard is not your color but your hair looked nice.
962302154361974784 2018-02-10 12:28:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @lcmoser The NRA is a hate group that advocates violence. Dont believe it, watch some of their propaganda.
962300180983926785 2018-02-10 12:20:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepShimkus @CarlSpoerer2018 Completely shameful and also exceedingly corrupt. Their cult members believe their lies.
962299590136532998 2018-02-10 12:17:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @JTMann05 @timbell72 @contrarian11 @RWFRITTE @ELMiKiNGBiNG What about this? This is not relevant but oh yea you deniers like to try and through crap at Steele. Mueller has nothing to do with Steele. 9 trump folks had 32 (known) meetings with Russia and every single one lied multiple times about it. Why? Because they are guilty as crap.
962234219735941120 2018-02-09 07:58:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @JTMann05 @timbell72 @RWFRITTE @ELMiKiNGBiNG No they are not. Manafort has many charges, hes guilty as sin. Gates too. Flynn is a bloody traitor and copped to  lying about meeting with Russians. Same for Papadopolis. Youre just wrong but...uranium one debunked almost as much as bullshit Benghazi. Fake News Dude.
962231606546182144 2018-02-09 07:47:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @JTMann05 Yea Harvard educated lawyers are dumb. Bahahaha
962231178249064448 2018-02-09 07:46:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @JTMann05 @timbell72 @RWFRITTE @ELMiKiNGBiNG MAR. Flynn, Papadopolous have copped a plea and are testifying. Manafort indicted, Gates indicted and rumored to be brokering anoth plea. In the not too distant future you wont be able to believe the lies you cling to.
962223285957210112 2018-02-09 07:14:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren @BoobPunchTina Wow that is really horrible. Im so sorry it happened to you. I really cant stand cops.

962218495156080640 2018-02-09 06:55:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @LizWFB @FreeBeacon Says the Fake News Source.
962213656590155776 2018-02-09 06:36:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven Apparently youre not an expert in English either as you seem to think that putting a question mark at the end of a statement makes it a question.
962202088364236800 2018-02-09 05:50:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven Ummm no, I wasnt kidding.
962178418602401793 2018-02-09 04:16:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven Wow Ill bet you really sucked at it.

962048464669429760 2018-02-09 19:40:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @tomwatson And so F***ing predictable. We need to impeach his ignorant, lying, racist, sexist, Treasonous, pussy grabbing ass.
962026585447530496 2018-02-09 18:13:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @TuckerCarlson @realTomShae Dream On, pretty sure you have to do more than Be Black.
961965518755368961 2018-02-09 14:10:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @norisgirl Same Here.
961964908261924864 2018-02-09 14:08:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianschatz Rand Paul is a total phony just like his Russian loving daddy.
961808349984641024 2018-02-08 03:45:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @CyrusToulabi John Kelly needs to stick his lying mouth and his pedestal where the sun doesnt shine.
961802045111128064 2018-02-08 03:20:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianschatz I enjoyed listening to you on the Pod!
961801944460382209 2018-02-08 03:20:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianschatz Its a bad joke by a corrupt creep!

961796448361897986 2018-02-08 02:58:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @wokeluisa @ProgDemLib @SaltySaidit Tax Scam.
961795882252369920 2018-02-08 02:56:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @wokeluisa Hes awful and he too likes the damn Russians 
961782547129790464 2018-02-08 02:03:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @chuckwoolery This is gross.
961638863046414337 2018-02-08 16:32:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @67jewelCDH She clearly has issues with judging peoples character.
961638679889481728 2018-02-08 16:31:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @4everNeverTrump No doubt about it. Once you conspire with the Russians, security clearances are pretty blas.
961638381213179905 2018-02-08 16:30:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @starbuck13502 So much for the thou shall not lie thing

961634801487925248 2018-02-08 16:16:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @MacTXPress Saw you on CNN, you looked like such an idiot.  I dont know about Kelly you what the guy on the hill in Afghanistan does care about? He cares about the RepubliKlans conspiring with the bloody Russians, you too are a traitor.
961631719047778307 2018-02-08 16:04:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @JakeSherman @BucknerTracy @DawnMacc FYI I too am standing in line to vote. However, calling McConnell and Paul can be pretty darn discouraging.
961631432123838464 2018-02-08 16:02:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @JakeSherman @BucknerTracy @DawnMacc Im not sure jumping down her throat is helpful. I think she was trying to make a point and I for one,do understand what shes saying. It can be pretty Lonely standing up for whats right when you live in a very red state and look like you belong in the other party. Just saying.
961627573179551744 2018-02-08 15:47:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @JanzforCongress Doubtful. Theyve pretty much turned on everybody decent.
961626507562102785 2018-02-08 15:43:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @KaivanShroff @forrestbrakeman Hey now dont forget, theyre really good at hating, sowing Division and taking money from the poor to give to the rich.
961625416472678406 2018-02-08 15:39:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattysmalls @KaivanShroff @A1exCunningham Please speak for yourself.
961625056844578817 2018-02-08 15:37:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @KaivanShroff @lauraevf1968 Thought the exact same thing. What a fire cracker!
961624594133258241 2018-02-08 15:35:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @tweeterberry1 @KaivanShroff @KenBonnie I have to admit that Ive had my doubts about Nancy. Not because of her but because of how effectively the RW nut jobs use her. But after today, Im back in her corner. I just hope it doesnt cost us the House bc we must take back power from these Russian loving extremists.
961609230380949505 2018-02-08 14:34:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianstelter @Anativeamerican Bonnie arent you a little young to be watching Faux Fox News?
961608311270408192 2018-02-08 14:31:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA How the hell do people even listen to obvious frauds like this?
961605253148938240 2018-02-08 14:18:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @gormanm I would not buy a pair of shoes from that sleaze ball.
961604971073605632 2018-02-08 14:17:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @RatherOddFellow @fdell3 No I didnt think so. Isnt that most interesting. I want to know what states. Im going with PA, WI and MI. Just a hunch!
961598845225439232 2018-02-08 13:53:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @jdawsey1 @greenspaceguy No it is not contagious. Some white men know that their dominance over our society is in question. Kelly was this mean son of a bitch before he met trump. Only bad people would work for trump.
961594277506805761 2018-02-08 13:35:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @Dangchick1 @sebulia1 Yes that would be my opinion. The majority of republicans in power have clearly concluded that the Fake News mantra has worked. Fox News, Breitbart & the like can say whatever they want to say and their followers believe it. Mix in some God is on our side and you cant lose
961591703676350464 2018-02-08 13:25:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Chaplain_Billx Thank you Chaplain both for serving and for speaking the truth.  Kelly is a scary bad man.
961589797226733568 2018-02-08 13:17:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Dangchick1 @sebulia1 You need to let that go. It is definitely not coming. Either the Dems rise and take care of this disaster or our Democracy is over.
961589026254934016 2018-02-08 13:14:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @NicolleDWallace Not even principled republicans will Work for him. If you still believe there is such a thing. Personally, Im really tired of the Neanderthals. They all need to be fired.
961588434618978304 2018-02-08 13:12:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @NicolleDWallace Not a one Nicolle.
961587835722661888 2018-02-08 13:09:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @RepMattGaetz You sir should be tarred and feathered for your incessant lies.
961585279852253184 2018-02-08 12:59:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @JessicaValenti @Barrett_Laurie 100% Barrett. We already know its true of 4 of them and Id bet my last dollar its more of them.

961425110824517633 2018-02-07 02:23:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepDonBeyer This admin is so ass backwards, the facts about Porter probably worked in his favor.
961419023559741440 2018-02-07 01:58:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 Im going with Demon Possessed and way too much work.
961417416055099392 2018-02-07 01:52:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @trytostopJane @geokelley Yes I thought the same thing and Im pretty well informed these days. I guess we know why and it sounds like his job was quite influential. Im so tired of all of the corruption.
961414662926536704 2018-02-07 01:41:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyWchu Nope total BS. But dont worry, it wont be too long before they find their concern again so that they can cut all of the entitlement programs.
961413331813830656 2018-02-07 01:36:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @TopherSpiro @JRubinBlogger @HeadExplodn Jennifer, like many other conservatives, likes to give trump the lions share of blame for corrupting her former party. If her party had not already been VERY CORRUPT, There would not ever have been pres trump.
961392360793038848 2018-02-07 00:12:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @TheRickyDavila Too bad MSM cant seem to factor that fact into their coverage.
961389958161424385 2018-02-07 00:03:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @TopherSpiro @JRubinBlogger Jennifer you darn well know its more than seems that way.
961378376131973120 2018-02-07 23:17:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @seankent Shes awful.
961255091155193856 2018-02-07 15:07:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepDaveBrat hey if you voted for the Tax Scam then shit the F up. Mr I taught Economics. ANOTHER IDIOT GOP
961240617027334144 2018-02-07 14:09:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Yes Richard, another competent Dem. I hope you dont equate this shit show with only trump.
961240250868748288 2018-02-07 14:08:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub This sort of think makes me sick. I can only imagine how it makes you feel Walter.
961221071767826433 2018-02-07 12:52:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepMattGaetz @PhilEhr Gaetz is a GOON.
961208822453932033 2018-02-07 12:03:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @JackiSchechner Im sure they are but they have no choice.
961092317426962432 2018-02-06 04:20:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu I can tell by this picture that this guy is nice.
961062886645944320 2018-02-06 02:23:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @CatalogueDonald One individual associated with the American Conservative is Pat Buchanan, that fact alone is a deal breaker.
961061890767114245 2018-02-06 02:19:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @CatalogueDonald Have you voted for Dems in the past?
961060664155475970 2018-02-06 02:14:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @CatalogueDonald Look what google says about your source.pic.twitter.com/zvH8bzU7GX
961060002776698881 2018-02-06 02:12:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @TDPattillo @Drummergirl29 Well it seems clear that trump has been laundering Rubles for quite some time. I
961052720454078464 2018-02-06 01:43:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @CatalogueDonald I think is was terrible that trump said he wasnt a hero. TERRIBLE.
961052181247004673 2018-02-06 01:41:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @CatalogueDonald Yes I did. Compared to most Cons, Id say hes pretty good although I dont agree with his politics. Are you a long standing Republican?
961051587748786177 2018-02-06 01:38:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @TDPattillo @Drummergirl29 Ive not heard that but for sure the Cons have been dealing with the Russians for longer than BLOTUS has been around.
961051072809914368 2018-02-06 01:36:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @TDPattillo And very, very corrupt.
961049640933183488 2018-02-06 01:31:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @CatalogueDonald God youre a nut job. The non trump republicans are the only ones with any integrity. That would be the day that BLOTUS exposes anybodys corruption. Hes too darn busy breaking laws himself to care about anybody else. Trump is a Mobster.
961044845778350081 2018-02-06 01:12:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @CatalogueDonald Yea the Republican lead and dominated FBI was for Clinton. Yes it failed All right. Trump is the worst president in history and hell be gone before 2020. Enjoy it while it lasts.
961041599382814720 2018-02-06 00:59:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @olgaNYC1211 Oh hell be right, it will definitely be about him.
961037820830912512 2018-02-06 00:44:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @CatalogueDonald Yea sure.
960984376594063361 2018-02-06 21:11:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @fairskies F U BLOTUS ONLY PUTS RUSSIA FIRST.
960976959667924993 2018-02-06 20:42:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @davidaxelrod BS Kelly is exactly who he appears to be as much as I cant stand BLOTUS, we cant blame Kelly on him.
960974243222773760 2018-02-06 20:31:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA This fact goes to show that a cult mentality can inspire people to believe all kinds of crazy things.
960973486658342912 2018-02-06 20:28:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @karinsveejones He is so gross.

960575875061297152 2018-02-05 18:08:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @JonRiley7 I did not vote for Bernie but yes, 79 is ridiculous.
960574962888306695 2018-02-05 18:04:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @PRyan @CynieLu @DeniseARubin No they have not. They willingly sold their souls to the highest bidder in order to hang on to power.

960556946200899584 2018-02-05 16:53:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @persistantpengn Well Im guessing our Allies wont touch a State dinner. If he cant go to England without huge backlash, who would accept?

960554175959654402 2018-02-05 16:42:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @BlakemanB Ps Dems will not forget about your betrayal to our IC. You Cons are going to hate those ads. LOL.

Yes, Dems are far more ethical than Cons. FBI is full of Republicans 
960549179457196034 2018-02-05 16:22:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @johnlundin Good, I like Rep Schiff. Hes kind of square but he seems honest and committed to this country.

958335194464997377 2018-01-30 13:44:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @EricBoehlert WTF?
958334557127716864 2018-01-30 13:42:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram @Blacklace40 I will not be hearing it-NO WAY its nothing but falsehoods and divisive hate speech.
958334204164694017 2018-01-30 13:40:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Why am I SO NOT SHOCKED.
958333290850783233 2018-01-30 13:37:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 Im tired of folks claiming that trump has created this tragic state in the GOP. That is FALSE. The Cons knew that trump was a crook,compromised by at least many Russian Rubles. Trump didnt create that opportunity, the GOP did. Every last one of them. Rick is spinning here too.
958323920721141761 2018-01-30 13:00:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jayge26 @WalshFreedom And yet you identify yourself as being part of the same tribe? Hmmm, whats that say about you Joe?
958201735494946816 2018-01-29 04:54:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kellyjorgense14 Same no way!
958200557730189313 2018-01-29 04:49:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @edavies @RadioFreeTom Well, if you havent expected this in the past year, youre not dealing with reality.
958197846943158273 2018-01-29 04:39:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kasparov63 No its not possible to believe that trump is not compromised.
958193007949484032 2018-01-29 04:19:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @CNN @TheLeadCNN @robjh1 Not too bright are you.
958173550514499585 2018-01-29 03:02:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @j_c_fitz Lol god knows dumb-dumb would read it, word for word.

958009372621328388 2018-01-29 16:10:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @RodneyDavis Yea it works for the MAGA rich quite well also your release the memo crap is crap. Cons are cons.
958002410680659968 2018-01-29 15:42:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @samrothschild Says the bot brain that supports Julian Assange. Gross.

957767750373527552 2018-01-28 00:10:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @CarlSpoerer2018 I always say yea, right to work for less.
957767521079308296 2018-01-28 00:09:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @SecretaryZinke @CarlSpoerer2018 Zinke is a stand out crook among many crooks. F him and the horse he rode in on.
957751229450477568 2018-01-28 23:04:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol @debitking Recently updated his denial to no obstruction guess he finally got that memo.
957750778227240965 2018-01-28 23:02:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @LawyerRogelio @cadburyisbest1 Many times Ive thought they were fake accts but nope, its dumb-dumb.
957750480733704192 2018-01-28 23:01:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @nalugal @BillKristol Whats old is new again accept trump is 100xs the crook that Tricky Dick was. #MAGA by getting rid of all the crooks.
957749396766150656 2018-01-28 22:57:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @LawyerRogelio @cadburyisbest1 Ok it seemed pretty extreme but after what Kelly didvto Rep Wilson, anything goes.
957747908643885057 2018-01-28 22:51:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @LawyerRogelio @cadburyisbest1 Is this really COS John Kelly tweeting this?
957745006739165184 2018-01-28 22:39:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepDonBeyer 100 rubles says it did. Dumb-dumb jr meeting with Russians in Louisville Kentucky. CROOKS.
957744337730883584 2018-01-28 22:36:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @Pkakooza Really its not like it took exhaustive research to figure it out. No way anybody would fault dumb-dumb for not doing that 
957387270956507141 2018-01-27 22:58:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein @Mech17760 Perhaps it was a missed opportunity but perhaps he believed the Cons said they supported the Dreamers as well.
957383348749524998 2018-01-27 22:42:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub Im going with total bullshit.
957380285095731203 2018-01-27 22:30:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @rockmorerecords Yes I was just looking at that, thanks.
957378679272767488 2018-01-27 22:23:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @rockmorerecords I do not agree.
957363366514880512 2018-01-27 21:23:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol @JayRouseDC Ever? Its way more than that, Id guess 200 easy.
957329622894632960 2018-01-27 19:09:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein @Mech17760 I guess Im part of his grateful base although we have private insurance. I was grateful for a kind, articulate, intelligent president. Everything that trump is not.
957265700724322304 2018-01-27 14:55:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein @Mech17760 Bot logic?

957242303046979584 2018-01-27 13:22:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein Its also called being a Democrat. Precious few Cons could be described in this way.
957240450125049856 2018-01-27 13:14:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @NicolleDWallace @whisperwill1 Didnt you mean for their own rubles not reasons.
957239502350815232 2018-01-27 13:10:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @NicolleDWallace Nicole, the secret loon society is far from secret.

956861834056826880 2018-01-26 12:10:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Sorry It rates an F.
956861599549153280 2018-01-26 12:09:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein Fake President
956690527587577856 2018-01-25 00:49:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @islandlady712 @maziehirono It should offend us all. They dont call us a melting pot for nothing.
956688714360598529 2018-01-25 00:42:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @bhsnitzer @RevEricAtcheson You might but trump, never.
956677235330691072 2018-01-25 23:56:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianschatz The Alt Wright Creed, so sad.
956659912460898304 2018-01-25 22:47:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @woodruffbets I guess they think its like everything else with trump, if they say it enough, people will believe it. They could say it a billion times and Mueller wont believe it sucker.
956656301966352384 2018-01-25 22:33:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @brianklaas Pandering of the lowest order.
956653627376111616 2018-01-25 22:22:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnFugelsang This is such a tragic picture. And 30% of us think the White Dude is classy. Mail order Melania has had enough.
956652537389740036 2018-01-25 22:18:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind No Doubt.
956650328157577218 2018-01-25 22:09:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuddLegum @kira_lerner Yet Pam Bundi can take public pay off from trump and their Congressman run from their constituents for fear they might have to answer to them. Wait until Tax Scam rapes Medicaid and Medicare and the people from Puerto Rico vote. I see a Big Blue Wave there.
956640819250909187 2018-01-25 21:31:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @burgessev @MyraDSirois1 @seungminkim So much for his empty bible verses.
956639679448801284 2018-01-25 21:27:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuddLegum Paul Ryan is a despicable person. Hes as dirty as the day is long.
956638439457378304 2018-01-25 21:22:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @jimsciutto @tRickSalsman It wreaks of desperation.
956637857665437696 2018-01-25 21:20:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @jimsciutto CONS ARE CROOKS.
956637074869932034 2018-01-25 21:17:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @stonecold2050 That I would watch and I avoid watching or hearing him speak like the plague.
956635379070898177 2018-01-25 21:10:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProudResister Oh Mueller is very well aware. 
956634176962355203 2018-01-25 21:05:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdKrassen Finally, Paul Ryan is a crappy Speaker, it seems the pussy cat got his tongue.
956632460934221825 2018-01-25 20:58:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @RogueFirstLady That says it all. A World Class Conman and his Mail Order Bride.

956613017982074880 2018-01-25 19:41:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @WTF @realDonaldTrump @BenjySarlin @bhsnitzer @specialFX_Baker The Cons have embraced a very divisive and hate filled platform. Theyre Anti-Everything accept themselves. If they make good money, they think its Gods blessing. If you dont, theyll treat you like youre cursed. Theres your Secret Society of Christian Mersenaries.
956609591848075265 2018-01-25 19:27:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @alaskarebel @ProudResister Treasonous Trashy Trump, The Worlds Greatest Conman and Mobster. He lied his way to the Alt White House. RESIST.

956587907535527937 2018-01-25 18:01:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @pithypacky @Max_in_Vienna Im guessing there are many Rubles among those dollars. Im really tired of being friendswith the Russians, can they please go back to being hawks who saw Russia as the Totalitarian Mobster Run country that it is. Hmm, its starting to make sense. RESIST
956585614522175488 2018-01-25 17:52:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @adamcbest Their use of the Good Book is only good if you are the man of the family. Screw That. Trump Republicans are Regressives and theyre desperately trying to hold onto power and money. We will not be forced back into the kitchen or the closet. Moms & More.
956581946263572480 2018-01-25 17:38:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @BetterInfra No, hell just pocket money and funnel it to Mega Donors in kick backs.

956494399508230144 2018-01-25 11:50:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @AviAhvee Interesting, as soon as I read five Congressman will meet evil leader, I knew they would be RepubliKlans.

956178640148074497 2018-01-24 14:55:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol This is certainly not new with trump Bill. Id say we owe Gingrich, Limbaugh, Rove and Fox a big F U for this current reality. Theyve been lying scoundrels for quite some time. Any dummy can clearly see that Dems are much more ethical. Cons have lost all decency but it aint new

955788691682856962 2018-01-23 13:05:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeresaAnne50 They dont want to release it because its just more Nunes BS. Why do you think theyre not releasing it?

953461721213128709 2018-01-16 02:59:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @Re4mImmigration @CCCAction @WoobieTuesday @scapelliti @BillyCorben @jerryiannelli @GeoffMiami @UNITEDWEDREAM @sldmfree @FLImmigrant @ICEgov @kbrunocrafts @tomaskenn Yes very sad and needless.
953430601322901505 2018-01-16 00:55:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @JulieLillpie30 Same soulless dead eyes shared by Miller, Flynn, Gorka, Bannon and trump. Hate kills your soul.
953429055868755968 2018-01-16 00:49:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker Mistake.
953428607615021056 2018-01-16 00:47:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @JulieLillpie30 @RealMuckmaker Look at that man and tell me hes not full of hate.
953397087038836741 2018-01-16 22:42:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @kaitlancollins You whats really sad, I almost believe her,
953394012064493574 2018-01-16 22:30:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Well Im sure the Republicans were all over that
953386648045309952 2018-01-16 22:01:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @RonWyden Funny thats what the crazy RW nut jobs, Limbaugh and crew have been accusing Dems of for years.
953384445897297921 2018-01-16 21:52:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer @JRubinBlogger @KerryPicket @JohnSmithChgo Ya think?
953384214153621504 2018-01-16 21:51:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger Jennifer if the network bookers applied your standard, wed never see another Con on tv again. You know that Jennifer. Even the GOPs most honest are dishonest. Flake, Corker? See.
953382281745522688 2018-01-16 21:43:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 @theTenaciousCK @rjakes65 @TheRealMikeFair Remember when he first went for his previous physical with crazy Goldstein. Im pretty sure that it was initially reported that he weighed 265 and then lost 30 lbs but the time he went on tv with Dr Oz.
953381642772602880 2018-01-16 21:41:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnBlecka @samstein Sure as long as they take it from the big businesses and 1% that were given a huge tax cut because....they payed up front for it with the GOP.
953380942344749059 2018-01-16 21:38:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @ForwardKy What an Ass.
953379894918045696 2018-01-16 21:34:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @AddieWoolf I agree Kelly seems quite evil to me. Ever since he lied about that Congress women, well, thats been clear.
953364753887453184 2018-01-16 20:34:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @Stanford @McFaul @loletadude Can you imagine after this moron?
953364079678238726 2018-01-16 20:31:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @shoreboy1961 @krassenstein Well the L has accepted that hes a lying low-life Conman with 0 morals of any kind and his crazy base actually likes that about him because thats how theyd do it too SHIT SHOW.
953363571295039489 2018-01-16 20:29:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @SecNielsen @H_Town_74 Honestly, I literally trust no one in the GOP.
953361439502295040 2018-01-16 20:20:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @MzSailiante @MikeUp Please get real.
953356653579161600 2018-01-16 20:01:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChadPergram @theamazingtif Totally agree. Bannon is a lot of things, Hero aint one of them.
953355665950625792 2018-01-16 19:57:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @THP1640 @MadMom22 Really,  exactly when does that commence? This shit show has really gotten old.
953355336014028805 2018-01-16 19:56:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @Acosta @RedTRaccoon @craftyme25 @pfelser @Steamsnowwater Appreciate him all you want. We never trusted you Cons (for obvious reasons) the whole guilty lot of these criminals will pay dearly. Enjoy your Conman while you can.
953345792428904448 2018-01-16 19:18:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @THP1640 @MadMom22 Sadly no, there is officially no one.
953336725681655808 2018-01-16 18:42:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @girlsreallyrule @SenBooker Perhaps even more astonishing, youre surprised?
953283352450228224 2018-01-16 15:10:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Fox Faux News as his source, Bahahaha.
953278433450254336 2018-01-16 14:51:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @Pajjr2016 @LCNM99 Rotten Cotton is a rancid crook.
953277560204529664 2018-01-16 14:47:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOPLeader @POTUS @foxandfriends Total Bullshit. Today, Senator Flake will give a speech about how UNITED the RepubliKlan party is.
953272593645260805 2018-01-16 14:27:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @AltUSPressSec @putinsclown @lesliern92 @mlcooper63 @ThatICnTellU Pretty sure its from the Nazi Book.
953272061199339522 2018-01-16 14:25:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @Elviraafterthot @AltUSPressSec Seriously, look at this guy. Is anyone seriously surprised that hes a crook?
953268928591093760 2018-01-16 14:13:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @charliekirk11 Got to love your followers who say we must install tainted partisan judges before hauling up the Clintons to go before them. Meanwhile, trump and his fellow crooks have conspired to steal presidency with the GD Russians. Wtf is wrong with you people?
953267949434961920 2018-01-16 14:09:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @charliekirk11 If he did (which I seriously doubt) it was at Putins demand. Rand is fond of the Oligarchs Rubles as well, coincidence?
953266937886380032 2018-01-16 14:05:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @charliekirk11 Ummmm your hair needs serious help.
953266653608935424 2018-01-16 14:04:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @charliekirk11 This is BS.
953265596514295808 2018-01-16 14:00:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Gee I wonder how Gorsuch will see that. NOT.
953264961811345408 2018-01-16 13:57:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @DearAuntCrabby Thats right HOLD YOUR GROUND. We are watching and taking names.
953263118926450699 2018-01-16 13:50:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @lcmoser Well that pretty much says it all. Keep um fat, dumb and poor. The Republican Mantra. #MAGAt
953259681983627264 2018-01-16 13:36:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @DukeChronicle @VUMChealth Ive been following Dr Gu for awhile now, I believe him, end of story.
953113965097312256 2018-01-15 03:57:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @fawfulfan Good God Im pretty sure were cursed. As if a McConnell and Paul arent bad enough we have to have Bevin as the governor here in KY?
953056696972259328 2018-01-15 00:09:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @NatashaBertrand Unless they just somehow end up in the presses hands ALA the Cons.
953056313382178817 2018-01-15 00:08:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @NatashaBertrand @QueenBe74182030 Yea he already did HA!
953055823152013312 2018-01-15 00:06:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @NatashaBertrand Someone needs to make the truth about Nunes transparent.
953055473300893696 2018-01-15 00:05:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @TanousLisa Take those away and its full on Putin Plan. Eliminate your enemies by locking them up indefinitely or by making them disappear forever. In a New York minute.
953054609383346176 2018-01-15 00:01:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @FLOTUS @axios @fritchee @drmarty2k I like it! I also like Dimwit Donnie.
953053462815756288 2018-01-15 23:57:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @ironstowe KISMET.
953005391541137413 2018-01-15 20:46:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Forth grade is generous.
952965979885187072 2018-01-15 18:09:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhiteHouse What a sad joke this white shithouse has become.
952920046858375170 2018-01-15 15:06:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @snowflake_miner @amandablount2 Wow see the contrast?
952905668125712386 2018-01-15 14:09:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @JeffFlake @tshequine @fawfulfan My feelings in Flake: Hes totally FAKE.
952890763423244288 2018-01-15 13:10:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @TopherSpiro @bloomonthetweet @PaulVladChockul @jillostewart I dont believe she cares. Their marriage is just another of his sleazy transactions.
952890337432829953 2018-01-15 13:08:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @BBLarue @TopherSpiro Not Even One Day. He is completely classless. Trashy Trump Strikes Again. Enjoy it MAGAts.
952886433131450370 2018-01-15 12:53:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @LiberalMmama Theyd have 10 Independent Committees on just that topic by now. Theyd also have 20 more going looking into some of the other horrible stuff he did. Cons are Complicit.
952884332229808129 2018-01-15 12:45:03 UTC <HenslerKate> FYI: A-Hole did not win fairly and squarely. If you have to conspire with our enemy to win, you did not win fairly and squarely you won by cheating.
952882026985742336 2018-01-15 12:35:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @JesseBWatters @TuckerCarlson @kurteichenwald Sorry Kurt that you and your family has had to endure this. I knew Fox was bad but I really didnt realize they were this bad. That being said, Im also not surprised.
952879339489644544 2018-01-15 12:25:12 UTC <HenslerKate> To those among us who voted for trump because he was the lesser of two evils. Guess what, you suck at judging peoples character.
952528835744067585 2018-01-14 13:12:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein @holliward Its even worse, he could shoot someone on camera and then turn around and convince his followers that Hillary did it.
952528348416180224 2018-01-14 13:10:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein Oh what do you mean, the card carrying evangelical Christians are really into values, oh wait, never mind.
952525930374795265 2018-01-14 13:00:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @pastormarkburns @viacampmimi @tedlieu This pastor is the trump of the ministry. That is to say that hes not particularly godly, at all.
952185220605861889 2018-01-13 14:27:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @MattBevin @SenateMajLdr @RandPaul @HuffPostPol @AntiGOPActivist @Astorix23 @eagle1776n @AngelaSambataro Terrible. We need a strong candidate for 2020 to take his ass down.
952176807402500096 2018-01-13 13:53:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarkJKremer I believe he believes them. If he didnt, hed be more adept at changing them as theyre proven to be lies. He doesnt alter them, same stupid lies over and over and over.
952176106974654469 2018-01-13 13:50:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag @krassenstein Nunes is a lying idiot.
952174605132845056 2018-01-13 13:44:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @VP @nanawithbanana @StopBigMoney Omg, So much for appearances. Pence is even scarier than trump for me because he actually seems to believe it.
952174114889977856 2018-01-13 13:42:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @jackiekcalmes Wow the tides are finally turning. Even the trumpers are seeing him for what he is. Not that Grassley will notice, hes pretty far gone it seems.
952172938731679744 2018-01-13 13:38:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @AngelinaSnow007 @Jake_Bernstein This is sick. Hes raping and pillaging our country for a quick payday. Once this damage is done, its done.
952171988361019392 2018-01-13 13:34:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @SafetyPinDaily Well he called him that because thats exactly what he is.
952171118386917376 2018-01-13 13:30:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @alicetweet Sweet Alice, trumps words were racist because he is a racist! Is that REALLY above your pay grade? Please-spare us the faux ignorance. Youve backed a bushel basket full of racists including Huckabee, Santorum, Bachman and Cruz. That makes you an expert in Racists. Own It.
952169318753751040 2018-01-13 13:23:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @sendavidperdue @TomCottonAR @POTUS @GovMikeHuckabee @ElijahEOkon So I pointed out what was wrong, your response?
952165106795929600 2018-01-13 13:07:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @sendavidperdue @TomCottonAR @POTUS @GovMikeHuckabee @ElijahEOkon Elijah if you consider yourself a Republican, youre being played for a fool. Sorry, but that is the painful truth. Way too many Rs are racist and they would happily send you back to your homeland. Pray on that.
952163920785100800 2018-01-13 13:02:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @sendavidperdue @TomCottonAR @POTUS @GovMikeHuckabee @ElijahEOkon Senators Cotton and Perdue did not say he didnt say it, they said they didnt recall. Of course they recalled, they just didnt want to talk about it publicly. He said it multiple times.  Huckabee knows this, hes lying. He too is a racist.
952156381351686146 2018-01-13 12:32:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @sendavidperdue @TomCottonAR @POTUS @ElijahEOkon @GovMikeHuckabee Shut Up Mike, Fake Minister. Lindsey Spoke Out (Surprisingly) People believe what you say about like they do your daughter. Durbin is a principled man, now extinct in the GOP.
952155160607887360 2018-01-13 12:27:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @HuffPostPol @Astorix23 @AntiGOPActivist Oh yes, in our race to the bottom, KY wants folks to be super poor. #MAGA
951987995686637568 2018-01-12 01:23:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @rjakes65 @bimmerella Way Too Much!!! Flush his ungly orange ass.
951972534089547779 2018-01-12 00:21:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC He finally won something! Trashy Trump.
951969274951856128 2018-01-12 00:08:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @B52Malmet This is like the script for another Trashy Trump Reality Show Don the Con Dicks Over DC.
951931722135998464 2018-01-12 21:39:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 No Dems should attend. He does not deserve their presence. Stay Away. Hed probably hire seat fillers so that their absence doesnt effect his ratings.
951928571093757952 2018-01-12 21:27:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Trump is a human turd.
951882897342025735 2018-01-12 18:25:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 Your making a good point!

951813632194764800 2018-01-12 13:50:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @CoaleAmy Oh come on, this is Twitter, spill it!!!
951813075241439232 2018-01-12 13:48:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig Lol thats exactly what I thought when she caught hell for the comment. Half are proud of their hatred and half know to keep it quiet but its sure as hell more than half. If not, where are they now. Who is speaking Truth to Power among the Cons? Exactly.
951807599527079937 2018-01-12 13:26:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @BillOReilly @goladygo45 @skrappi41 @hersbadII @ro4352 Bot!

Hes a mean nasty hateful money laundering racist traitorous dummy who embarrasses our country on a daily basis. Blame CNN, gee whered you get that one?
951806497234784256 2018-01-12 13:22:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @trumps_feed @BillOReilly @TestKitchen21 @hersbadII @Barbhrmn @kikdee23443445 Dumb Bot!
951805744415899648 2018-01-12 13:19:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @DNC @realDonaldTrump @thekoukoureport I could not agree more. Ted Lieu kind of tries, Eric Shalwell a bit. We do need an outspoken truth teller, desperately. One who just says it like it is already. We need new leaders in Congress as well. If they cant lead in such extreme times, they just cant lead.
951801358189056001 2018-01-12 13:01:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @RBReich Well the Cons will of course because they are totally complicit. No Dems should dare show face there. He does NOT deserve that.
951795964423098369 2018-01-12 12:40:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @JaxMaCack No Jack we arent back were where weve been. Stuck in hideous hatred.
951794791712477185 2018-01-12 12:35:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @Sassycatz @davidfrum MAYBE please David, own it, we all know the truth. He is a money laundering Mobster Racist Traitor. Hes a Crook. Russia if youre listening PLEASE, spare us the additional insult.
951792832733466624 2018-01-12 12:27:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @viacampmimi @dix_iechick Ive been saying this for months Becca. The truth is, not only have the RW Nut Job Haters been emboldened, so have we all. Im far less willing to civilly engage with them now. Its time to force them back under their damn rocks. Enough is Enough. Vote the loser liars out
951783610511712258 2018-01-12 11:51:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @cryborg I have to think Mueller will slow walk this thing until 2018 as info on trump now would go no where. Other shoes will drop before hand though.
951662834781491201 2018-01-11 03:51:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GOP @OMGno2trump @RichardPMacLean His eyes are so dead. If those are the window to his soul then he has no soul.

951498441104023553 2018-01-11 16:58:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 I will pay 100$ to the first reporter who asks him to share one of those letters!

951488617515507713 2018-01-11 16:18:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @KathrynTomashu1 @joncoopertweets I have absolutely no doubt about that. ZERO!!!
951485188453863424 2018-01-11 16:05:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA To error is human but to hold yourself up as a pillar of virtue and then piss on morality is uniquely Republican.
951483483704168449 2018-01-11 15:58:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @ACLU @GMA @votevets @GOP @ananavarro @Deja_Great @Bugl3t @DoubleNW Please vote for all Dem women. Unfortunately Repug women dont advocate for women. They tow the party line and vote in favor of very rich people and big business.
951482059205365760 2018-01-11 15:52:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @Comey Knowing the right thing and doing the right thing for your party Sir are two different things.
951437216445861888 2018-01-11 12:54:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @JW4Resistance @fawfulfan Fox Business Host hmmmmm?
951251877089423360 2018-01-10 00:38:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @DevinNunes @chucktodd @RepAdamSchiff @JanzforCongress Yes Nunes it seems is very fond of Russians as well. We need an Independent Committee just for him. And Ryan. And McConnell. And Graham. And Grassley. And Rohrabacker. And Burr. And Rexon. And Jevanka. And Conway. And Bannon. And Jordan. And Miller. And Gorka. And Trump. And Jr.
951224291273707520 2018-01-10 22:48:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost BFD, at least he didnt take a private plane.
951212909429960704 2018-01-10 22:03:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC Sure Lindsey, where in the hell did you get that?
951199704351760385 2018-01-10 21:10:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @dawnresist @kylegriffin1 Bye-bye Slime Ball.
951193084150403073 2018-01-10 20:44:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC Look how far youve fallen. F. U. Lindsey
951185646151962624 2018-01-10 20:15:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @Donna_West @nbcwashington @Sage_dude @lefty3761 Oh now I see youre a damn bot!
951185521807691776 2018-01-10 20:14:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @Donna_West @nbcwashington @Sage_dude @lefty3761 Are you really this simple minded? How are they mooching off of Americans? You do Know they pay into social security and dont receive it, right?
951184828078141443 2018-01-10 20:11:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @nbcwashington @BeckyIB Its so dumb.
951184407779577857 2018-01-10 20:10:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @bkat5150 @TRUMPSHUGETV I dont know for sure but I heard thats Mark Warner. Maybe from the house? Good bye, so happy to see him go.
951166916260921344 2018-01-10 19:00:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCardin @rickhoward25 Yes trump was the one that conspired with the Russians to steal the presidency. And then obstructed justice to try and stop the investigating that conspiring. So theres that.
951163524864270341 2018-01-10 18:47:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @davidaxelrod @MikeLevinCA Poor poor Issa couldnt take the heat! What a slimy little wimp he is! Great job Mike!!!
951162737626963968 2018-01-10 18:44:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jim_Jordan Oops their not there (probably shouldnt tweet while I exercise)
951161869062037504 2018-01-10 18:40:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @historyball @tedlieu Exactly when was it that it was best case for the Cons?
951161637385498625 2018-01-10 18:39:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @historyball What a bad joke these crooks are!
951160864241061889 2018-01-10 18:36:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckGrassley Look if you want Kushner to come testify then SUBPOENA his lying ass. What a bad joke you are. Youre either to dishonest to tell the truth or too old to recognize it.
951155535084249088 2018-01-10 18:15:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jim_Jordan You are totally full of shit. Grassley would not release the Fusion Doc so how were they supposed to do it together? Also, what we learned from the doc was that Cons have been lying through there teeth, oh wait, weve known that for a long, long time.
951154657770041346 2018-01-10 18:11:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @1jenn37 @NavKaz Yes about like hitting the lottery and getting struck by lightening at the same time. Good luck!
951150027753345024 2018-01-10 17:53:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @NavKaz More importantly, GOP wants nothing more than to cut funding to all POC. Dems do quite a bit for POC Navid and theyre the party of inclusion. GOP is the party of collusion (with our enemies)
951073258287267840 2018-01-10 12:48:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @TravisAllen02 And dont forget the brick!
951072462116093953 2018-01-10 12:45:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Rosie Hes obviously had too much booze, women and movies.
951071935248633857 2018-01-10 12:43:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @KassandraSeven Yea thats probably just to cover her monthly plastic surgery bills.
951070265257156608 2018-01-10 12:36:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen Well Sir, to be honest, that has been very clear since before he took office.
951068381666521088 2018-01-10 12:29:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @LaurenWern Famous French Actress. A Real Besuty. Shes 74 now.
951067773207183360 2018-01-10 12:26:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @AngelinaSnow007 @CNN They cant. Dems are already alienated. Treason will do that.
950958616227524608 2018-01-09 05:12:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BuzzFeedNews @InvestigateRU @MichaelCohen212 Sure Michael as if anyone would actually believe you. RIDICULOUS
950935020339974144 2018-01-09 03:39:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @EndDeportations Too good ones too!
950918733568110592 2018-01-09 02:34:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC Who really cares about what you say Linda, you lie like a rug.
950918471361101830 2018-01-09 02:33:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC Senator Graham, today the world was shown that you are a lying partisan hack. We dont care what you say about anything. Stick It.
950914917170929664 2018-01-09 02:19:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Well thats just bull because I didnt read fusion transcript and Ive know since before the election. If they didnt know then they didnt want to know.
950844330973061130 2018-01-09 21:38:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @alaskarebel @JuddLegum Omg these people (Cons) are so out of control. We must remain vigilant and assume that they will lie and cheat every chance they get because theyve more than proven that.
950843018185269250 2018-01-09 21:33:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCBerniecrat I do not find him to be very presidential but then look at #45 
950842628358246400 2018-01-09 21:32:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCBerniecrat Yea that does look pretty good but Im still stuck on hes too old. I will not vote for him in the primaries.
950833329523363841 2018-01-09 20:55:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCBerniecrat Im not very familiar with these ladies but I like that theyre ladies! I fear this country might not be ready for a female-which is one of the reasons we ended up with Dotard! I do support a progressive agenda.
950830101863829504 2018-01-09 20:42:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @Robbins17Chris @NCBerniecrat I meant Joe. Not uncommon for people to say no but then end up running.
950829906862247936 2018-01-09 20:41:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @Robbins17Chris @NCBerniecrat Also Id like to see Chuck and Nancy step aside.
950829707913826305 2018-01-09 20:40:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @Robbins17Chris @NCBerniecrat Schiff will be 59.
950829343864971264 2018-01-09 20:39:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @Robbins17Chris @NCBerniecrat Bummer, I like him quite a bit.
950829242610307073 2018-01-09 20:38:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCBerniecrat Harris will be 55, Newsom 52, Murphy 47, Kennedy 39 in 2020. For me, that makes a lot more sense.
950827925192011776 2018-01-09 20:33:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCBerniecrat Lol not this Dem. I think younger is what this country needs but Ill vote for the Dem candidate no matter who it might be.
950827391257120769 2018-01-09 20:31:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCBerniecrat @Robbins17Chris What about Harris, Kennedy, Schiff, Murphy, Newsom,? Its going to be a very wide field, I feel certain.
950826818742910977 2018-01-09 20:29:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCBerniecrat @Robbins17Chris Wow didnt realize Warren was so old!
950825430587727873 2018-01-09 20:23:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCBerniecrat I think dumpster will make many fearful of older people (understandably) we dont know whos running. Many may be significant younger. Also, people of color are not big on Bernie (with some legitimate concern) I would NEVER vote for a CON but sure would like to see electable Dem!
950740631080534017 2018-01-09 14:46:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @Oprah @IvankaTrump @TomWellborn @BetsyGervasi @howcomhimiswear Not me, the kissing one is worse in my eyes. All gross though!!!
950722354866458626 2018-01-09 13:34:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @bryanbehar Hmmmm no, theres no hope for Stevie.
950721053185249280 2018-01-09 13:28:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @Oprah @IvankaTrump Oh no its another special place in Hell for Robot Barbie.
950594729363824641 2018-01-08 05:06:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @proviewsusa Rodney Bernie will be 78 yrs old in 2020. His ship has sailed, hes just too old.
950592467837116416 2018-01-08 04:58:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @bkat5150 @kylegriffin1 @GriffinJacobs5 Tired  can use
950592340539920385 2018-01-08 04:57:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @bkat5150 @kylegriffin1 @GriffinJacobs5 Thank you for your commitment. We can you all the good teachers we can get.
950591672676769792 2018-01-08 04:54:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @bkat5150 @kylegriffin1 @GriffinJacobs5 Some teachers
950591606851297280 2018-01-08 04:54:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @bkat5150 @kylegriffin1 @GriffinJacobs5 Even have to worry about done teachers.... guess thats not new.
950582656714014720 2018-01-08 04:19:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @bkat5150 @kylegriffin1 @GriffinJacobs5 Oh no. I guess the background check seemed kind of strange to me because when my kids were young, no check. As they got older, required. Youre right though, they let folks come in for shows etc.
950579599389478913 2018-01-08 04:06:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mrclean1982 @MrFilmkritik Anybody Even A Little Surprised?
950576976846381057 2018-01-08 03:56:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @axios @waltshaub @My2Two2Cents Little edgy? No, no congrats. Didnt mean to offend you, just saying that I did not take it the way  that you did.
950576268323557376 2018-01-08 03:53:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @GUANOPSYCHOTIC @TweetiepieHolly @bob_burrell Never have, never would. Ive always considered them dishonest, self-serving and about the rich. But I have to say, this Russian Crap really blows me away. Even I didnt think they were that bad. So much for the hawks, more like buzzards.
950575290274799616 2018-01-08 03:49:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @bkat5150 @kylegriffin1 This is awesome. It couldnt happen here bc to volunteer in Jeff Co schools in KY you must have a background check.
950574685460336640 2018-01-08 03:47:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @axios @waltshaub @My2Two2Cents It was unstable morons and I did not take it that way (FYI)
950574218814656513 2018-01-08 03:45:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @axios @waltshaub @gbollmann01 Theyre not just allowing, theyre aiding and abetting and personally profiting from it.
950573387558080513 2018-01-08 03:42:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @axios @waltshaub @PMLorber Hes out of it and its scary. He shouldnt be in charge of his own affairs let alone those of our country.
950572819317915648 2018-01-08 03:39:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @axios @waltshaub Indeed.
950568449553633283 2018-01-08 03:22:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @reesetheone1 @beremh @e_ofYork @DSaatco You can be intrigued all you want. If you actually think trump will run again in 2020, youre as deluded as he is.
950567098392203265 2018-01-08 03:17:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @bryanbehar That dude is really scary. I feel very sorry for his liberal parents.
950549904086138883 2018-01-08 02:08:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @DrDinD Yes it is. Ive known forever that some of them were but wow theyve quit even pretending. Its really repulsive.
950517319549235200 2018-01-08 23:59:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @DanaRohrabacher @carrieluckas @BarbaraBoxer This guy is just awful. What is wrong with an American who would vote for him?
950516911422525447 2018-01-08 23:57:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @reesetheone1 @beremh @e_ofYork @DSaatco Yea HRC got her JD at Yale, dumb  dumpster on the other hand is like a stable genius. Except hes neither stable or genius, but he played one on TV!
950474359319220224 2018-01-08 21:08:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @XanderTaylor3 Yea I know the color, I like it too!
950474220408070145 2018-01-08 21:08:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @reesetheone1 @beremh @TrumpHasTheTape Oh Id bet hed know. His lackeys wound trample one another to get to him so they could be the one to scoop the News.
950471199745769474 2018-01-08 20:56:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @XanderTaylor3 Your new hair color
950470965418393600 2018-01-08 20:55:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @XanderTaylor3 Do you like it?
950369718820630528 2018-01-08 14:12:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @wesley_jordan I do watch Fox every once in awhile. Its shocking how much they tell blatant lies.
950367309838934016 2018-01-08 14:03:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @wesley_jordan Same Im ok with Republicans but those dumb dumbs they hire are really bad.
950341074169495553 2018-01-08 12:19:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @SamRitter5000 Yea youre wrong. People NOT HAPPY with Tax Scam.
950340269353963520 2018-01-08 12:15:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes Sorry, I do not. I find it completely repulsive and I detest what its doing to our Country.
950335497628512256 2018-01-08 11:56:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @FriendEden100 Ummm yea, thats scary.
950335048636600320 2018-01-08 11:55:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @eugenegu Wow Youve Been Trumped, RESIST.
950237100447883264 2018-01-07 05:25:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SafetyPinDaily I dont believe hell Do it.
950236671966175232 2018-01-07 05:24:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenJohnMcCain @JRubinBlogger @sajanorth22 @roberts_frieda Im pretty sure its both. What happened to all the hawks? Its disgusting.
950215468694073344 2018-01-07 03:59:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @WSJ @jaketapper @JamesVGrimaldi @BarbHuber9 He wants crooks that will destroy and impede the work of the cab or agency they lead. Its really very sick.
950212942338908162 2018-01-07 03:49:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @murphymike @MelissaJPeltier @PG_13CO @ZGare Ummm no, the Cons have NEVER been colorblind.
950212559105339399 2018-01-07 03:48:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @murphymike @MelissaJPeltier @Divarty4Life @PG_13CO Good for you. Hes such a phony as you obviously know.
950212093357248512 2018-01-07 03:46:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @murphymike @MelissaJPeltier @PG_13CO Bet you mostly vote Dem. The Cons have gotten to be so extreme and I can tell youre rational.
950210284836261893 2018-01-07 03:39:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @downhiller1976 For Sure!!!
950209849887019008 2018-01-07 03:37:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza @What_If_Only And The Don hes like a smart person John I can tell by your pic youll be getting a tax increase-hope you enjoy it!
950209458642280453 2018-01-07 03:36:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza @What_If_Only Pretty awesome First Lady!!! Got to hand it to the conservatives
950207833869635585 2018-01-07 03:29:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger Jennifer are you no longer a Republican?
950204931201490945 2018-01-07 03:18:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @Hoppyson @DineshDSouza God what a dumb point. Younpeopke think Money is the only thing that matters. Its sad really.
950178277347426304 2018-01-07 01:32:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jory_Nal I dont love Lindsey but he seems a bit too political to get himself into that nightmare. Hell stay in the senate.
950177648373723137 2018-01-07 01:29:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @BetsyOShea I just havent really heard if hes actually doing some kind of stupid show-trust me I will not be watch
950172044427235328 2018-01-07 01:07:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jory_Nal He said no. I think Linds knows that would be making a bargain withvtge devil. I dont think hes that dumb.
950170623988420608 2018-01-07 01:01:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @BetsyOShea Is he really doing some sort of award show? For Fake News? Wtf
950169096074727424 2018-01-07 00:55:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Id say cynical/hypocritical is generous. Complicit and compromised are what come to my mind.
950168228411691010 2018-01-07 00:52:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobbieResister I said the exact same thing. Anybody seeing that and thinking it represents them in a positive light is not stable or smart.
950163270001885196 2018-01-07 00:32:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeamPelosi @Luckylaurie2 Yes I trust her although I would support a younger Dem for the leader position. I dont know what the heck your meaning youre talking about with Hep B? Maybe you can get another republican gov to ruin your economy again. Theyre great at that.
950146544258486272 2018-01-07 23:26:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @NavKaz He can change all he wants, he is certifiable if he thinks Dems would support him at all.
950145411762851840 2018-01-07 23:21:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @marilyn555 @samhoyt14 @waltshaub @EttyM Not medicated enough. I too noticed his strange tics.
950144157087076352 2018-01-07 23:16:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @marilyn555 @samhoyt14 @BernadetteMhill @waltshaub Just watched that last night, pretty sure its too late for old Steven.
950119519921590272 2018-01-07 21:38:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS I think they should be stranded in a place where people dont pay taxes and see how they like it. Of course, as you say, theyd be fine if they die. I dont know who they think are going to buy their products? Mercers similar mindset I gather? Warped for sure.
950117386245623808 2018-01-07 21:30:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Honest question Dennis, how do these Koch nuts think any services will be provided? Like police or judges, parks or libraries etc?
950116197370130434 2018-01-07 21:25:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @guapofalbq @ddale8 In two weeks
950113860761112576 2018-01-07 21:16:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS @Green_Heart These people are so sick.
950092566841757696 2018-01-07 19:51:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeamPelosi @maria_cutrone Lol at first I thought that was a happy Jared.
950092035410808832 2018-01-07 19:49:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeamPelosi @BCsknees Omg this is really cra cra. Hes an evil little hater.
950091589631795206 2018-01-07 19:47:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeamPelosi Keep speaking out. Lead, lead, lead.
950090828797620224 2018-01-07 19:44:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix Too bad Pompeo has already proven himself to be a lair. I do not trust him, not even a little bit.
950052891435335680 2018-01-07 17:13:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @robreiner @tamaram62877538 @wheetz Well whatever it is, its super bad.
950051606279663616 2018-01-07 17:08:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @CeeLeeMusic @Tids1960 Yea were not communists so you can let that go.
950019631581945856 2018-01-07 15:01:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @3cutebabies @careaware Me too! I hate Paul Ryan.
950016780231208960 2018-01-07 14:50:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @keithboykin And yet he always handled it with style and grace, despite the fact that it was dishonest and divisive from day one. Mental Inquiry Now.
949869494293417984 2018-01-06 05:05:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @Shelster011 @thedoggeneral1 That is some really crappy crap right there. Im tired of the blatant show of corruption. The cons have been completely emboldened by The Don and theyve gone full on Mobster with him. Lets get rid of The DC Don & his Capos in Congress.
949867218619248640 2018-01-06 04:56:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @Brasilmagic @DrDinD Really wtf America? We can thank the Cons for this too! The Russians have also infiltrated the NRA. The republicans have a hell of a lot to answer for. Mueller is coming for you Cons.
949865952820301824 2018-01-06 04:51:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @HelloItsJosie @stealthygeek Like hell, hed been in jail many years ago or hed be dead because the mob killed him. Hes a Grifter and Con Man who works for organized crime.
949855550002683905 2018-01-06 04:09:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @perlmutations Jeanine is like the drunk lady out of 1950s central casting. Send her back please.
949808963738062848 2018-01-06 01:04:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @ae_rush @IronStache Yes and Yes. You got this Randy, a real working man. Lyin Ryan is a total sell out to the donor class. TaxScamMan
949808196394340352 2018-01-06 01:01:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @guapofalbq She is a Rock Star and she knows it. Ruth The Rock Star, Rock On. We love you Justice Ginsburg!!!
949757525729206273 2018-01-06 21:40:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenGillibrand @Margaretocasey @TeslaKillsOil Bot-Block
949757180714078208 2018-01-06 21:38:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @LaikaWilson @SenGillibrand Senator. You want to lead, then lead. Support March to Save Our Democracy on 1-20-18. Not Womens   March, but Peoples March for Democracy.
949756320974098432 2018-01-06 21:35:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Amy, you have a well deserved huge following. You see this for what it is. Could you lend support to the March on 1-20-18. We must show strength and reignite the Resistance to save our Democracy.
949753038020988931 2018-01-06 21:22:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @slash196 Agree. Shell roll right over and sing like a canary. Cant wait to see it unfold.
949752682503462912 2018-01-06 21:20:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson I do not think Hope will take the fall for him. Shell flip before its over. Cant wait to hear Hope, I have a lot of Hope Hope for good tail but Ive never met a Hope Hicks
949751165926936581 2018-01-06 21:14:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @euchreman1022 @TheBaxterBean This is sick. The RW Fake News Conspiracy Kooks with the support of trump and Crooked Cons in Congress are definitely damaging our Democracy. We, the people who see this for what it is, must show strength lest we watch them burn it to the ground. Jan 20th, RESIST THE FIRE.
949746905810128896 2018-01-06 20:58:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @persistantpengn @AHamiltonSpirit Kentucky has not forgotten, I can assure you of that. He is a crook. He too likes Russian Rubles. I guess its kind of a defining characteristic of the Republican Party now. Mitch is a leader all right. Hope he leads the way to jail.
949744806619643904 2018-01-06 20:49:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @NYCBroadwayBaby Its cash for trash all right. Cash for Trashy Traitor Trump. Guess what, Andrew, you slur your words too. Trump is clearly incompetent. 32% approval, that aint great politics.
949743832689795072 2018-01-06 20:45:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuddApatow @hilowriter @milesbillings @bbacon_bacon Pretty sure they gave extra points for rich daddys who bought degrees.
949742276250660865 2018-01-06 20:39:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @SavoySummer @JuddApatow Im pretty sure in his demented mind, if hes not making News he thinks hes irrelevant or his ratings are slipping.  This punch
949734822947311616 2018-01-06 20:10:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaeldweiss @Max_Habs Thank you. Ive heard his name but was not familiar with his story. Very colorful.
949727460878364673 2018-01-06 19:40:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaeldweiss Who is that?
949718687661117440 2018-01-06 19:05:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @SofyaAngelz @shannoncoulter It is so sick and twisted after all the money they had been spent to try and prosecute her fir something. This Trashy Traitor Trump conspired against the USA with RU and DOJ is looking into HRC. This is a travesty. When do we stand up for Our Democracy?
949715503114805248 2018-01-06 18:53:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetoORourke Nice turn out Beto. When do you suppose Lying Ted had a town hall that was attended by normal people and not those willing to buy a seat? I get a good vibe from you. Ill cont to support you. Go Beto Go.
949712349107249152 2018-01-06 18:40:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @reesetheone1 @beremh Glad to hear you say that. No doubt theres got to be some perverse pleasure in this for her. I think she should troll the crap out of him. It might force his inevitable breakdown and it would be so entertaining at his expense. Win/Win.
949710033679511552 2018-01-06 18:31:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @U2dayFeel @stpeteyontweety For some reason, I find this very funny.
949707278512422918 2018-01-06 18:20:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @reesetheone1 @beremh God no, Im sure shes mad as hell and very concerned about our country. She knows how terrible this is.
949706743373852672 2018-01-06 18:18:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum I havent seen it. Oh god I can only imagine how bad it is. I wish you were joking but of course youre not. This Realty TV Presidency is a complete flop and the lead actor is losing his shit. Its time to cancel this trashy trump show.
949667708785823745 2018-01-06 15:43:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lee_in_Iowa Wow and I didnt really even trust him but he just spoke out recently didnt he? Such criminals in power, will we really make it out if this? Im beginning to doubt it.
949665877640798208 2018-01-06 15:36:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianschatz Well thats for certain Brian. We dont intend to let it be forgotten any time soon, either. RESIST. Please speak out more. Dems need leaders, not obedient sheep. An out spoken leader now, could write his own ticket in 2020!!!
949664849021239297 2018-01-06 15:31:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @777_rooster They are picking people to destroy their departments. Hes bankrupted 6 businesses. He launders Russian money which is the only reason hes not in prison, yet. In short, hes a dirty lying Mobster. Wake up Big Time. Oh youre a damn bot. Never mind!!!
949663867805806593 2018-01-06 15:28:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Well, I know Im really inspired.
949663284159971328 2018-01-06 15:25:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetoORourke Go Beto!!!!!
949662226545369088 2018-01-06 15:21:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @Deplorablesrme I dont follow trumpers.
949662071020498945 2018-01-06 15:20:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @Deplorablesrme @mike_Zollo Ps I can look at your pic and tell that youre going to get hosed on your taxes. ENJOY!!!
949661858092474369 2018-01-06 15:20:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @Deplorablesrme @mike_Zollo That is indeed a crook, Mobster and lying Traitor, but you got the Indeed right!
949661287935508481 2018-01-06 15:17:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @Janet4OH @papacarl1956 He lies constantly and its very clear he knows exactly what hes doing by the damn twinkle in his eye. Hes gross. Hes a typical Republican politician.
949657681635266560 2018-01-06 15:03:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNewsResearch @brianpferguson @LosCrozo Bahahaha NO, its not.
949657369000251393 2018-01-06 15:02:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @FoxNewsResearch @ehprewitt @FestusFilbert @JBHinOC Yea its not like Fox News, is it?
949657080293740544 2018-01-06 15:01:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @seanhannity @jaketapper @FoxNewsResearch @Galileo242 @RichDrees Total BS.
949656895379435521 2018-01-06 15:00:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @persistantpengn @FoxNewsResearch From Faux Fox News? Who slipped them actual facts?
949656616038789120 2018-01-06 14:59:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier @Mikel_Jollett Same Mikel. You seem like a smart and normal guy. Both seem to be in short supply these days. Nice post.
949656175951400961 2018-01-06 14:57:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @spunkkee Lol I hadnt but yea, I do now!
949655825987067904 2018-01-06 14:56:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @Diane_7A Bahaha, scary how much they have in common.
949655157452795904 2018-01-06 14:53:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChelseaClinton @SeanaArrechaga So sweet, this makes me cry.
949654783224418304 2018-01-06 14:51:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @mokojumbee @SeanaArrechaga So sorry for your loss Seana. I cant begin to imagine how hard that must be. Your precious son has a lot of AC in him. Thank you for sharing your story with us. Hes a hero.
949653653513752579 2018-01-06 14:47:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @B52Malmet The expression going to Hell in a hand basket comes to mind.
949652468635496448 2018-01-06 14:42:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @777_rooster Bahaha how is trump qualified?
949651835501064192 2018-01-06 14:40:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @Legallybeagle @JohnBlecka Same here. The rampant racism was effectively used to harness their hatred and attract votes. I guess having a smart competent black man was more than they could handle. I really never realized how hated he was. I was always very proud of Pres Obama as opposed to the W.
949648924440256512 2018-01-06 14:28:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheMataHari @jacktink Trump of course, without any hesitation, Im sure.
949647124655984643 2018-01-06 14:21:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @Legallybeagle @JohnBlecka Many Cons Ive talked to really just vote their wallet. They say Im a fiscal conservative & social liberal (they vote Repub). Im pretty sure none of them were of the 1%, so jokes on them. Collectively, we need to return to caring about people, all people.
949646026473865216 2018-01-06 14:17:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdKrassen @mokojumbee Me too Charles. Lock their dirty lying butts up, regardless of Party. Although, Im pretty sure its a lot more Cons then Dems.
949645001394450432 2018-01-06 14:13:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnBlecka @Legallybeagle I dont get that either. How anyone other than an old rich white man coukd vote for him, Ill never understand. And even then, they arent very caring. This gay guy told me he voted for him and I was shocked.
949643947688816641 2018-01-06 14:08:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @senjudiciary @mshopemac @SenBlumenthal Senator, you need to gather your Dem colleagues and rally the troops. I heard exactly 0 of them on cable news last night. This is a total travesty. Get them speaking out & leading. You Dems are totally losing this battle/war. Lead Now We Need You Desperately.
949643105787052033 2018-01-06 14:05:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jeff424V Im like a beautiful and brilliant prosecuting attorney with 100% conviction rating. Ill be handling Donnies case. ENJOY!!!
949641576145457152 2018-01-06 13:59:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @viacampmimi @samstein I think when those who say hes like a child, they really need to stipulate like a 7 year old child.
949640219493654528 2018-01-06 13:54:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol @ananavarro @mike_Zollo @Kerbonoski Loves Vets. Too bad hes cut so much money and services tobyiu though. Because hes like such a smart and stable guy Im just certain he has a plan for that.
949639796565139456 2018-01-06 13:52:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol @ananavarro @mike_Zollo @Kerbonoski Hey Jerry, Ill do exactly as I please. This is still a free country for now anyway. Mike does have a Nazi haircut, he also seems a bit unhinged. But Im glad hes your friend. We also RESIST here in KY.
949639106212089857 2018-01-06 13:49:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol @ananavarro @mike_Zollo @Kerbonoski Why dont you ask your man trump? He lives vets! Bahahaha.
949477304278896640 2018-01-05 03:06:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @RachelAzzara @marymac169 @HoughMagicDragn Wrong it is not working.
949474226314063872 2018-01-05 02:54:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @rswfire It sounds like your mom and I have a lot in common. Dems are so reserved and controlled its ridiculous. Meanwhile the Putin loving Cons are Lying, cheating and undermining the rule of law everyday. Here we sit, just hoping it gets better. In fact, every damn day is worse! RESIST
949473138068348928 2018-01-05 02:50:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @khwalz Karen, its time for true Patriots to hit the streets. This is so beyond corrupt its truly scary.
949472641311756288 2018-01-05 02:48:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @olgaNYC1211 @MattAsherS @B52Malmet That is definite it for me Barbara. Thats as good as firing Mueller. Any Sessions replacement will definitely be a crook. That is the last straw for me.
949471524725157888 2018-01-05 02:43:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @rswfire Personally I hit pissed a long time ago. Why arent Dems in Congress leading? Why arent Dems demanding justice. Iranians are making us look like fools with their massive protests. Were just watching the Cons continue to corrupt-its shocking.
949467265514311680 2018-01-05 02:26:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @jasoninthehouse @MKHunt1066 Well there ya go, brilliant. You deserve Jason.
949463015321145344 2018-01-05 02:09:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @jasoninthehouse @MKHunt1066 Forget it Mark, no need to respond, I just saw your MAGA stuff.
949462663704215552 2018-01-05 02:08:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @jasoninthehouse @MKHunt1066 Yea I got that Mark. Being a Con is one thing but really Chaffetz is so simple minded and dishonest. Have you no bullshit meter?
949461124965191682 2018-01-05 02:02:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @Lee_in_Iowa DO NOT.
949460836472573952 2018-01-05 02:01:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @suevisa @SenatorCollins Well thats just too damn bad because they got your TaxScam vote and now they really dont care about your coastline. Too little, too late Senator.
949458891527639040 2018-01-05 01:53:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @mommadyl Same for old people Kathrin.
949458019812769792 2018-01-05 01:50:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @jasoninthehouse @MKHunt1066 Obviously not. Youre willing to vote fir stupid crooks. Thats not high standards Mark.
949453153631719425 2018-01-05 01:30:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @adamcbest Im guessing it has something to do with male/male sex.
949451145906458624 2018-01-05 01:22:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @jasoninthehouse @shaggy1989 Jeff is dishonest and racist and not very smart (quite a catch).
949450431436148737 2018-01-05 01:19:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @jasoninthehouse @MKHunt1066 Good Lord, you havent seen enough from these complicit crooks? Chaffetz is dumb and dishonest. Get some standards please.
949449855633707008 2018-01-05 01:17:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @jmartNYT @jasoninthehouse You are the worst, jason outhouse. The absolute worst.
949448326545661952 2018-01-05 01:11:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost NO, the RepubliKlans want it, let them fund it with tax scam profits.
949447690902962176 2018-01-05 01:09:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @lskurrus @tribelaw This is sick and says exactly who the Republicans truly are. RESIST
949447310118973440 2018-01-05 01:07:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @latinorebels @GailRNJD @ortizfeliciano I wonder if he regrets standing behind trump for so long? He got played.
949444316392550400 2018-01-05 00:55:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Well David, just when are you going to accept your party members for the crooks that they truly are? Theyve told you who they are, believe them.
949443629919195136 2018-01-05 00:52:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @barry_corindia @judith_dabney No
949441499837673473 2018-01-05 00:44:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonathanweisman @JamesAGagliano @SixxxNOR Zero.
949440366037565440 2018-01-05 00:39:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @ThomasDePascale Yea hes really bad. Dishonest and not very smart. Im kind of surprised hes from Ohio.
949437542520311809 2018-01-05 00:28:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaureenShaw @NativeTexan74 @JaneGummyof3 @reggies_human So sorry this is your reality.
949436594515259392 2018-01-05 00:24:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaureenShaw Wow this is deeply disturbing and yet not surprising.
949378239159525376 2018-01-05 20:33:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @samswey @ThomasDePascale I like both from what I know. Kamala I think is a good combo of both smart and reasonably down to earth. But the most important thing is that candidate can/will win. Joe a bit young but seems to be pretty good.
949376094578323458 2018-01-05 20:24:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @samswey I agree. Uncle Joe had his shot and his time. Hes too old. We need new blood. Let the old men head to pasture.
949375557162201088 2018-01-05 20:22:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @CREWcrew @ThomasDePascale Everyday were forced to see how profoundly the rot has invaded the RepubliKlan party. Its just horrifying.
949374297361059841 2018-01-05 20:17:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @JoeNBC @amnesiac85 Well now theres balance the budget .... Oooooppppssss.
949373710099771393 2018-01-05 20:15:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @viacampmimi @JoeNBC Joe seriously that ship sailed a long time ago.
949368028847837185 2018-01-05 19:52:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @IvankaToWorkDay Whatever it was, it was huge. His email got hacked. Im guessing it was love letters to his long standing male lover. Cons dont like that.
949363867800555520 2018-01-05 19:35:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @BruceBartlett Lol like the Keurig machines.
949355958207221760 2018-01-05 19:04:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @NolteNC Daily Caller, now theres a source.
949328997472784384 2018-01-05 17:17:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @jmartNYT @JohnJHarwood How bizarre that so many dont get that.
949328647701319681 2018-01-05 17:16:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @PacificBayley Yea but its a lot more than that.
949316121471193089 2018-01-05 16:26:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @DanaRohrabacher Turning on Sessions. PS please tell Putin the Resistance said F Off. Also youre going to loose big time in 18. Better keep your passport up to date

949274356299059201 2018-01-05 13:40:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @Chetlsmith @SocialPowerOne1 I looked Linda up, Gross.
949273412119269378 2018-01-05 13:36:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonathanweisman @JamesAGagliano Yes but my personal favorite is when TRAITOR became PATRIOT.
949271778840412160 2018-01-05 13:30:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @omarvaid @RealMGrimm If you think the flag behind you in your picture is a good thing, youre wrong. But by all means leave it because it does a great job of identifying you as a Faux Patriot Right Wing Nut Job.
949164034762342400 2018-01-04 06:21:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @MaxBoot @BoraxCross @saralynne65 Yea I highly recommend blocking the idiot.

949067085547585537 2018-01-04 23:56:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @ladiesgun Hes so bad and so old. He represents everything wrong with Congress. Nasty old lying crook.

Theyre busy passing tax scam, polluting everything, doing away with important regulations and putting extremist corporatists in judgeships. Its HORRIBLE!!!
949024658698985472 2018-01-04 21:08:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenCoryGardner @tsykes8888 @funkyfourdog Oh no, theyre very big on them when Dems rule DC.

948949387320979456 2018-01-04 16:08:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Every last one.
948916499166777349 2018-01-04 13:58:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @NatashaBertrand Bahaha I like smart women!

948914373510213632 2018-01-04 13:49:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNBC @JohnJHarwood The truth about it threatens a hell of a lot more than that.
948912951028838400 2018-01-04 13:44:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen @WalshFreedom Joe, you seem to have taken a little dose of reality as of late. Political opportunist perhaps?
948910533993955331 2018-01-04 13:34:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @JonJusth Sounds like Hope would be a good candidate.
948909210972147712 2018-01-04 13:29:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @jacklgoldsmith Just read about the Hoover Institute. Its generally regarded as being conservative. No shit, I would never have guessed. Stick it Jack.
948906518652575746 2018-01-04 13:18:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyraDSirois1 @kylegriffin1 Im feeling ok about it, I feel the tides have turned. It is in fact a New Year.
948905507091288064 2018-01-04 13:14:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnOSullivan36 @RBReich I have never respected Republicans because theyve always seemed selfish. Now I truly hate them.
948904177819881473 2018-01-04 13:09:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @_belle_curve_ @SenGillibrand If you post this stuff to see how folks are feeling about you, youve got to feel pretty crappy about the responses. After the HRC Betrayal, lets just say were a tad bit sensitive. You blew it and I used to think you were a viable candidate for 2020.
948903380881149953 2018-01-04 13:06:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @_belle_curve_ @SenGillibrand Remember Al, so do I. Youll be my last pick for Dem candidate Kirsten.
948902086489657344 2018-01-04 13:01:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @MaxBoot @saralynne65 @BoraxCross No Dems are inherently more ethical. Cons so busy using their Faux religion to attract RW religious zealots and haters.
948901371608293376 2018-01-04 12:58:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @MaxBoot @saralynne65 Yes Sara, you are 100% correct. Of course, who among us believed their position? That is the biggest reason Ive always had such contempt for them. Newt, moral high ground?
948900137002258432 2018-01-04 12:53:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindaWildes @MaxBoot No they dont owe an apology. But dont give yourself too much credit, the Dotard is a billboard for dumb. It didnt take a savant to see it, ok.
948899536176603136 2018-01-04 12:50:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @_belle_curve_ @democracynow What? They didnt manage to shoot any? We all need to take a knee. Who made that brilliant decision, All so that they could drop the charges?
948893526644940800 2018-01-04 12:27:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @sirDukeDevin Pence will probably got detoxified after it. Hes such a douche. For Senator Jones, its perfect!
948759238192648192 2018-01-03 03:33:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @davmor19672 Well that is certainly as it should be but I have very little faith in the Cons at this point.
948758132532174853 2018-01-03 03:29:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @AngelinaSnow007 @SykesCharlie REALITY.
948757005296074752 2018-01-03 03:24:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @davmor19672 Sure hope youre right but if this is at all reliant on Ryan doing something decent, I think we can forget it.
948752599876100096 2018-01-03 03:07:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @therealroseanne @JeffFlake @NoLibLove @SuzanneKelleher @wonderwise_ec And she would have been 100 times better than Dotard. You must feel pretty dumb.
948752218353782784 2018-01-03 03:05:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @DearAuntCrabby @JeffFlake Put up or shut up Jeff. You are all talk and no action.
948739848017457152 2018-01-03 02:16:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @SqueakilyJr @DigitalTrends Gee I wonder why. Lock him up too. Lock them all up at Bitmo.
948712510831591424 2018-01-03 00:27:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jim_Jordan @BanjoPat1 @steffan_nancy Wrong.
948712301602983937 2018-01-03 00:26:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jim_Jordan My Ass, we the people did not elect the Dotard.
948712125488345089 2018-01-03 00:26:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSchumer @Jim_Jordan Heres one for you Jim. Why do you and other crooked Cons pretend to be unaware that trump & other Mobsters conspired with the Russians to steal the presidency?
948710830408896512 2018-01-03 00:21:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jim_Jordan God You Are a Lying Crook. Youre done in 18.
948653087325085697 2018-01-03 20:31:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @senorrinhatch @SenateMajLdr @susie4equality Sure hope so. There are so many who are guilty its mind blowing.
948652655173427200 2018-01-03 20:29:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyceWhiteVance What a great day for Alabama and the rest of the USA. Enjoy It!
948640531130744832 2018-01-03 19:41:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @snowizkell Yea theyve known it was true for a long time. Ive known it was real for a long time for heavens sake.
948639933077573632 2018-01-03 19:39:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @WakeUp2News Fox, dont forget Fox and a whole lot of Cons in Congress.
948543032139411456 2018-01-03 13:14:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @kaitlancollins @waltshaub I dont really believe hes even that rational Walter. Im guessing he just talks about kicking ass and nukes and then orders in the pile of crap food. So much for the business man approach.
948537670539661312 2018-01-03 12:52:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @Peter_Wehner Yes and then theres the tax scam which is just great for America.
948536710232723456 2018-01-03 12:49:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @bill_auclair Its almost like something is up with the weather.
948435164627169281 2018-01-02 06:05:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @PrincessBravato @JCTheResistance Yes C. All of the above
948431232316166144 2018-01-02 05:50:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @SheriffClarke @WalkerWorst @SykesCharlie Well that is a revelation Charlie, another one. You appear to be such a nice guy but the truth is you do support many of the hateful beliefs that seem to unite the Cons. Im sorry to hear this.
948427545652981760 2018-01-02 05:35:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @beels It is so F***ing past time. Our government has been taken over by traitors and many of us know this is true. The F***ing Cons in Congress all know this. This is a Democracy, we need to show those crooks what that looks like.
948426462645964800 2018-01-02 05:31:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @Indyvoter707 @marceldirsus Wow I hadnt seen this. Theyve chosen their Allies. They chose Autocratic vicious men who lie and abuse their people. I guess we all know why.
948413614980988929 2018-01-02 04:40:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @NateSilver538 @jw8c No she was voted by a win of 3 million votes. Electoral college does not represent modern times. It must be abolished.
948411475911217152 2018-01-02 04:31:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @Analisa_Swan @mkraju All today. Couldnt someone Keep his crazy ass at the golf course? Who the hell told him what day it was? Hes ummm dissembling folks. For trumpers, that means hes cracking up. Amendment 25 now.
948408935836504064 2018-01-02 04:21:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @RWPUSA He shouldnt even have a gun. Not even crazy Roy Moores little baby sissy gun.

If youre a Dem or someone who cares about your country youll vote these traitors out and that is exactly what Al would want you to do. Unite, dont fight. Resist. I hereby swear to vote straight Dem even if a Damn dog gets the nomination.
948405176876093441 2018-01-02 04:06:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT @JeffMerkley @CoryBooker @joekennedy @KamalaHarris @DenbrotS We also need a new Speaker. Nancy has been good but we need new blood. Younger & more inspiring Speaker is needed. Its going to be a huge job. Adam Schiff, Ted Lieu, Chris Swalwell, Joe Kennedy. Personally Id like to see Adam unless hes president.
948378564466036736 2018-01-02 02:20:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @stevensantos @mattyglesias @DennisPerkins5 Hes to dumb to email. Claims he doesnt think its safe.  Makes first servant Hope Hicks do it.
948378073329750016 2018-01-02 02:18:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias God help us all.
948377823592542208 2018-01-02 02:17:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind So harshly that the Cons have to be served the death sentence. Its time to bring Truth back. Cons done, Fox Done

948326294999175168 2018-01-02 22:53:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @DumondVince Hmmm not sure what works better here, but your point is well taken.

948322321269448704 2018-01-02 22:37:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @DumondVince Thats the genius of trumpism. He doesnt need a way. He just says it and his followers believe him.
948306967092744192 2018-01-02 21:36:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnBlecka @TyishaWSB How dumb and a total waste of police time/money.

948209179399016448 2018-01-02 15:07:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Its democratic and youre dumb.

948184374389944322 2018-01-02 13:29:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Dotard is dotting again.
948050443602554880 2018-01-01 04:36:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @RayRLibrandi I will join you, he doesnt even deserve to be named.
948047996868087814 2018-01-01 04:27:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @joemamma_1 @funder Pronto. Its seriously not right. Everybody paying attention knows this.
948046849470074880 2018-01-01 04:22:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomPerez Dems Unite. United we stand, divided we fall.
948021579446931456 2018-01-01 02:42:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @PreetBharara @SiriusNews_com Boy you are really a conspiracy theorist nut job. Its like half of this country has decided to deny that facts are facts.
948021572442513408 2018-01-01 02:42:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @fvehafric @homemadeguitars I hate to say, this appears to be more and more true. Nothing else explains it quite like this, does it?
947958373517021184 2018-01-01 22:31:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @fukurouyoujo Perhaps so, to me the expression means they have given up any chance of doing the right thing because theyre so guilty themselves that they feel they have no other choice.
947953268759687169 2018-01-01 22:10:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA They are locked and loaded. They can not do the right thing because theyve already sold their souls to the devil. They have no choice but to try and weather the storm, the alternative is failure and potentially jail. They will stay the course.
947946245783523329 2018-01-01 21:42:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @PalmerReport @noway45nothim Yes, he made his first trump is awesome commercial immediately following that golf game. Apparently Linds handicap is super low. Its OBVIOUS.
947941419729244160 2018-01-01 21:23:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @PattiCucchiara @Diavix123 Perhaps. Not sure that helps matters. If crimes were revealed and GOP refuses to act despite massive protest it might prove lethal for many/most gop in midterms. No simple solutions. RESIST
947938057969422336 2018-01-01 21:10:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @PattiCucchiara @Diavix123 100% agree. Nothing would surprise me at this point. NOTHING. I think maybe it would be best if hed fire Mueller/Rosenstein forcing massive protests and GOP accountability. Our country is in peril & its horrible to watch.
947936348169736194 2018-01-01 21:03:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @DearAuntCrabby Good Lord, I guess her stylist took the night off? You can take the girl out of Russia but you cant take the Russian taste level out of the girl. Maybe shes going to fill in for Russia in the Olympics.
947935405961342981 2018-01-01 20:59:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @PattiCucchiara @Diavix123 Trump is a 71 year old man. GOP is totally complicit and most definitely should be making it very clear they wont tolerate the corruption but trump is an international Conman and Mobster. Hes working the ultimate Con here while the Cons pretend they dont know.
947907789220909056 2018-01-01 19:10:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @spunkkee @CDMitchell Its so warped that the best case scenario is him at his club playing golf. Until hes removed. Sad Truth.
947894558406438912 2018-01-01 18:17:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @EricBoehlert NYT:New York Trash. Their puff has gotten out of control as of late. Trump is playing them for fools and theyre so desperate to keep access they willingly submit to the treatment. Its wrong for so many reasons.
947892335597236225 2018-01-01 18:08:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @JacobAWohl @SheOfTheMyst Schmuck Turd.
947890994934140930 2018-01-01 18:03:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeauWillimon @JW4Resistance @NIHAustin Same for me here in KY
947885737818562562 2018-01-01 17:42:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @JLP4488 @donlemon Yall look happy!
947831643787718656 2018-01-01 14:07:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @BoycottUtah @kfhall0852 It was so nice of Dotard to invite all of those poor folk to join him at his club. #MAGA
947830246761431040 2018-01-01 14:01:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Realjmannarino Bull, middle American Dem here. Dems should RESIST until hes gone. You do not feed the monster, you starve it.
947828955314302976 2018-01-01 13:56:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @MalMalloyTweets @THCobbPHC @jichapin Sure, thats just dumb. He totally said thats what he did. He wasnt talking trash
947608704576360454 2017-12-31 23:21:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @B52Malmet Cant Wait!
947608380746682369 2017-12-31 23:20:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @B52Malmet Womens March was awesome. I need to recharge my batteries with an even bigger one. Peoples March
947590831346679809 2017-12-31 22:10:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenBlumenthal @braun_fay52 RW Con Job right there. Faux Fox News has been pitching that along with a lot of other crap. Deflect/Project much. Truth is Truth whether you like it or not. Get Truthed.
947531818751987712 2017-12-31 18:16:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @JillWineBanks Do you think you could make a case for Conspiracy? 
947459833971781632 2017-12-31 13:30:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Astorix23 @ArvertaB Exactly the same for me Arverta. I stated Id go to DC for Womens March  and I went. I havent stopped resisting since.
947331655626379264 2017-12-30 05:00:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 I ageee Jane. I said it immediately when I heard hes supposed to have physical. He wonted do it.
947250077785083910 2017-12-30 23:36:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @pacelattin @tenax666 @Tracydwyer7 The Fake breathy voice is so practiced. Up there with Paris Hilton.
947249669574455297 2017-12-30 23:34:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @pacelattin @tenax666 @Tracydwyer7 I prefer Robot Barbie.
947247494760751105 2017-12-30 23:26:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Fasten your seatbelts boys, this going to be a very bumpy ride.
947246294900277248 2017-12-30 23:21:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump That only works in Mobster World Dotard.
947204619326935040 2017-12-30 20:35:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenJohnMcCain @geegeebythesea @photonjeff @AngelinaSnow007 @benm328 That seems very clear.
947188550075928577 2017-12-30 19:32:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyGervasi @CoreyCiorciari Zinke is so bad, what a crook.
947187031867879425 2017-12-30 19:26:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @M_G_Stone No One. Hes Obstructionist in Chief. SAve your breath Mitch.
947181537908416512 2017-12-30 19:04:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @CitJourno @docrocktex26 @Jory_Nal Yes that truth and its connection to the US Congress.
947119065948188672 2017-12-30 14:55:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyGervasi @StephanieJ_DC No way. Theres a reason she plays such a good red neck. Thats exactly what she is!
947117923184898048 2017-12-30 14:51:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jory_Nal @docrocktex26 I will never forget the smug looks on the faces of these liars and cheats when they were able to pull off this heist. They seem to think it was all worth it, well see if they feel differently when the truth about them is widely known.
946912950534770688 2017-12-29 01:16:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind So True. So much for that liberal bias.
946901533433745413 2017-12-29 00:31:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaryAbrahams @RevDrBarber Racist hater Moore is done.
946860602986762241 2017-12-29 21:48:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan Maybe they should just lock them up like you do you two faced twit.
946856924468924416 2017-12-29 21:34:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @Steinernomics @richardbmcgee @Pop3Pam Sorry to hear that Pam. Was that child always somewhat different?
946856409836253184 2017-12-29 21:32:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @Steinernomics @richardbmcgee I agree. Those people scare me. Im a middle aged white woman. I cant imagine what it would be like to be a person of color.
946855758037159937 2017-12-29 21:29:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoshZ2012 @TeacherDave34 @MelanieMedia Agreed, here in KY, its alive and well.
946829438259474432 2017-12-29 19:45:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @Artisti777 So dumb.
946828282728734720 2017-12-29 19:40:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @therealroseanne @carnojoe @SettimiC Hey nana, your grandkids will suffer to higher rates of cancer thanks to all the good regulations that trump has thrown out! #MAGA (millions of angry gullible Americans)
946811879674040320 2017-12-29 18:35:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @VicenteFoxQue Think how we feel Sir.
946785534776696832 2017-12-29 16:50:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @mokojumbee Sadly, its probably better than the alternative.
946784899851325441 2017-12-29 16:48:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 AGAIN???
946784496585707521 2017-12-29 16:46:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @neeratanden Oh my Christopher Ruddy. That pretty much says it all.
946778513746616320 2017-12-29 16:22:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @AntheaButler @neeratanden Ya think?
946777783165968384 2017-12-29 16:19:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @calvinstowell @ryrysven @danintampa Its almost like Dems are harder workers. So much for all that personal responsibility crap.
946777229857644544 2017-12-29 16:17:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @Elviraafterthot @MSignorile This is sick.
946776857122365442 2017-12-29 16:16:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @WalshFreedom @My2Sintz Yes, Im highly suspicious. Im guessing hell run again and knows the trumpers are going down. Dont trust him despite his new-found rationality.
946776445162020865 2017-12-29 16:14:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @TXMarLo @BoundForBedlam Its like Super Size Me goes to Washington.
946773870555561990 2017-12-29 16:04:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @adidasHoops @MyReidnix @LouisvilleMBB I do not think hyping the adidas thing at this point is particularly smart under the circumstances,
946761954508595200 2017-12-29 15:16:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @alexandraerin Not from this Dem, I can promise you that.
946761642636972033 2017-12-29 15:15:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @alexandraerin Does anybody else suspect Syphilis is attacking whats left of his brain? Dr Bernstein wouldnt have a clue.
946761035213615104 2017-12-29 15:13:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @SeanMcElwee As into the poorly educated as the Republiklans are, they should just outlaw higher ed for their party.
946760131114684416 2017-12-29 15:09:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle Definition of dumb is trump.
946745783054987264 2017-12-29 14:12:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @Evan_McMullin EXACTLY.

946744943275577344 2017-12-29 14:09:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @politvidchannel Not loving any of these but Id say Sherrod Brown (of these).
946743498161704960 2017-12-29 14:03:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @TruthOnly37 @lesbianforlyfe It is F-ed up Friday.
946742736530624515 2017-12-29 14:00:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobertWeinber16 @LauraWalkerKC If he really believed this, he would have definitely fired sessions by now. Hes just preparing his flock for things to come. His 35% might be ready but the rest is us will hit him with fire and fury the likes of which hes never seen.
946741006480928768 2017-12-29 13:53:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @HaunJane @kylegriffin1 I mean really like a bunch of vultures. Cons have the decency of vultures and the nerve to call themselves conservative.
946736051477012483 2017-12-29 13:33:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @GenFlynn @justinhendrix #MAGA my white ass.
946735559032082432 2017-12-29 13:32:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @bluewave_news Trey Gowdy. Oh God, hes one of the worst (thats saying a lot) Gowdy must go. Hes a lying crooked banjo boy. NASTY.
946734664995213314 2017-12-29 13:28:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein He looks like a Nazi, probably a buddy of millers. Gross. I find the whole Republican Party to be completely repulsive. They all must go.
946733560962183168 2017-12-29 13:24:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Sure
946730543688966145 2017-12-29 13:12:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein Is this true?
946564720915550208 2017-12-28 02:13:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @Timodc @leoncrawl @JillWineBanks @nickakerman @CharlesPPierce @KimberlyEAtkins @RepCharlieDent @RepSpeier @chrislhayes @SykesCharlie @allinwithchris Saw you Charlie. The Republican Party has already been defined by the White Nationalist bigots. Your token moderates are fleeing like rats from a ship. The Cons ignored this trend for far too long. It now defines you and will taint the party for years to come.
946552548739207168 2017-12-28 01:24:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @bashful_one @288main Thank you for sharing your positive experience.

946512269529243648 2017-12-28 22:44:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 I feel very much the same way. Its blatantly corrupt on an international stage. We will get through it and make good progress as a result. People are Woke now and theyre not going to accept it any more. RESIST.
946509788246106112 2017-12-28 22:34:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @DevinNunes @JanzforCongress @callmerobz I think Beto will do it. Strong candidate Just gave him money. Go Beto!

946463044284149760 2017-12-28 19:29:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepCummings @SethAbramson @Honeybee0427 He should have known and he did know, Chris Christie knew, Jevanka knew, trump knew. They all knew.

We have them, been to tax scam, science, immigrant, anti trump (when he rallied here), hmmm Im sure theres been more. They kind of keep my enthusiasm up.
946397072303017984 2017-12-28 15:06:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @BlissAnnHerlihy @missdoobiez What are the devices seized by Mueller (somehow missed this one)
946396730026790913 2017-12-28 15:05:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan F U Paul. If you think youll be taking the money and running, you need to think again. You and your family will be forever haunted by what youve done with the TaxScam. ENJOY! (You will have earned every bit of it)
946395968852905984 2017-12-28 15:02:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @JohnWDean @CommentOnTWLB Yea, hows that going? Hes done nothing but make it exponentially worse.
946395398293344256 2017-12-28 15:00:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @PalmerReport @oxford_morse Just wondering, who would you say is the third?

946387019617497088 2017-12-28 14:27:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti @antitrumpresist I totally agree. Its everybody whos anybody in the GOP. It becomes more and more obvious each day.
946385881237217280 2017-12-28 14:22:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @rupertmurdoch @comcast @MSNBC @donohue_rebekah @LisaMarieChamp3 Ive been watching MSNBC for about 1.5 hrs, its been shown about 5 times (during Morning Joe)

946376852108660736 2017-12-28 13:46:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSusanCollins @WalczakLinda9 @TopherSpiro @fritchee @julianawriter The Ones I find most disturbing are those who present themselves as being moderate and rational and then vote fir the same shit bill that the nut jobs do. Susan will pay with her seat.
946374912012423169 2017-12-28 13:38:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @rupertmurdoch @comcast @MSNBC @donohue_rebekah @LisaMarieChamp3 Here in KY they play the Tax Scam ad all the time. Its really bad, almost laughable. They show this dude in a ski hat (big dude) thanking trump for lowering his taxes. No doubt, hell be getting them raised 
946374269931544576 2017-12-28 13:36:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @rupertmurdoch @comcast @MSNBC @rcarr57 @donohue_rebekah You know your Tax Cut really sucks when you have to show a stupid commercial trying to convince people how great it is!

945373539120680960 2017-12-25 19:19:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @KiethMessinger You Crazy Cons like to think that Libs cry a lot, good, Im glad you do.

Zero anything on HRC despite years/millions wasted in an effort to find her guilty of something. You decide. What about your facts? Should I check Info Wars for that?

944924727394668544 2017-12-24 13:36:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub Youre obviously a very nice man Walter. But not only trumps haters have been emboldened, all of us have been. Now, we can just say this tweet is completely demented coming from our worthless potus.
944923260403224576 2017-12-24 13:30:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @gerialgia @lessguns They are all total A Holes who ONLY care for their rich donors. They must be voted out.
944707732522840064 2017-12-23 23:14:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @Shelster011 @renato_mariotti They are Russian patriots!
944707093105446913 2017-12-23 23:11:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias What I cant believe that, POTUS even declared opioid overdoes an emergency. You mean that didnt help, Im shocked!
944687490111365120 2017-12-23 21:53:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kanew Omg thats really hard to do!
944685676183859200 2017-12-23 21:46:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @RandPaul How much have we spent so that F**k Face could play golf and profit of it personally at the same time?Oh I forgot, you sometimes join him dont you Rand. You too, are part of the Russia First Club. Dont think we dont know Rand, WE KNOW, even here in Kentucky. Rand s Rubles
944652177989042177 2017-12-23 19:33:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bmrm2000 I can only imagine what the Russsians have The the Cons!
944651962531885057 2017-12-23 19:32:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bmrm2000 Lets look at Gowdy, Jordan, Gaetz, DeSanto, Nunes, & Burr to make sure that they are non-partisan in their investigations. Lets look NYC FBI. Ridiculous, they cheat everyday of the week and twice on Sunday.
944633521984897024 2017-12-23 18:19:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bmrm2000 I can only imagine the crazy Conspiracy Crap they came up with. Between Benghazi and her emails Ill bet there are hundreds of damning emails amongst the Conniving Cons (do you think any of their spouses are political) Total Load of rubbish. Millions of dollars for NOTHING.
944553004044300288 2017-12-23 12:59:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Politicsinsider @DinaEllithorpe Hes so gross.
944551823167361025 2017-12-23 12:54:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @allinwithchris @chrislhayes @MSNBCPR @AriMelber @SRuhle @AliVelshi @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence @maddow @joanwalsh @MSNBC @SusieMadrak @neurrutia @vet4democracy @whisky5ho Yes dont love Chuck Todd either. I used to but I agree, hes desperately trying to see both sides and sometimes that just isnt possible.
944550372114300929 2017-12-23 12:48:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC just hearing that you fired Joan Walsh and youre keeping Hugh Hewit. This really makes me mad. Joan is a bright progressive that we admire and Hugh gives most women the creeps. You need to rectify this or pay the price! Its a mistake!!!
944549040938782721 2017-12-23 12:43:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @joanwalsh @MSNBC @DrXPsychologist @SusieMadrak What I hate Hugh and I liked Joan, wtf, this makes me mad!
944375761150062592 2017-12-22 01:15:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @aravosis Hes at least rational but I agree, he too is a wolf in sheeps clothing. Hes a Con, just like the rest.
944343080735576064 2017-12-22 23:05:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @NaomioftheNorth @paradiseunlimi1 GOP/trump used FBI investigation relentlessly despite no charges. Now look at how far theyve fallen. Two huge indictments, two copped/flipped, many more to come. Interesting approach to Draining the Swamp. Cons are Lying self-serving scoundrels. Lock Them Up.
944340533094346752 2017-12-22 22:55:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @paradiseunlimi1 @NaomioftheNorth WaPo, NYT, MSNBC, CNN, Politico, Economist, Business Insider, other legitimate twitter sources.
944339633374187521 2017-12-22 22:51:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @NathanHRubin @BrocknBlue Using Fake News source to support your Fake News Channel is probably not a great strategy. You said nothing about Nathans very logical and legitimate reasons for being furious about what trump has done. You just sited a Fake News Source. Weak, very weak. Fox is PROPAGANDA.pic.twitter.com/U5JcPfpRsj
944337601066094592 2017-12-22 22:43:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @kelkelsc @NathanHRubin Perfect synopsis Nathan and theres a lot of us. 
944336452292435968 2017-12-22 22:38:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @NaomioftheNorth @paradiseunlimi1 It was a hit job on HRC that they (NYC FBI/Comey) fired the night of the Pussy Grabber tape, coincidence Im sure. Emails had already been litigated ad nauseum. The Weiner computer thing was obvious fake story used to distract from Pussy Grabber. So Much Gaslighting going on.
944289357929828353 2017-12-22 19:31:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @TVietor08 Precious.
944233751768453120 2017-12-22 15:50:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Wtf now? Im so sick of his unilateral everything This is Democracy. He is not our Dear Leader. Blue Wave Coming 
944192947976921088 2017-12-22 13:08:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Maybe for you, not me. I say it a lot!
944184145256869889 2017-12-22 12:33:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @LynEpar Awesome experience for you though!!!
944184067809054720 2017-12-22 12:33:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @LynEpar Look how far weve fallen. Stop The Crooked Cons.
944180867248910336 2017-12-22 12:20:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepSwalwell I suggest nice jewelry for Christmas. That pretty much fixes everything. Congressman, please keep speaking out against the Crooked Cons, we need honest and open leaders, youre one of the few. DONT STOP!
944178316562530304 2017-12-22 12:10:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @tenax666 @SusanGlamMom Agree completely but to be clear their donors are already very, very rich.
944176676518408192 2017-12-22 12:03:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @bessbell @chris_wellen Chris, man youre not too bright are you? Hope it was worth it to you but I seriously doubt it will be.
944068130783064064 2017-12-21 04:52:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @gerialgia @SenBobCorker You need to be debunked Senator. Your lies are completely transparent. Lies, lies and more lies. Cons lie professionally and you Sir are NO exception.
944030450179280896 2017-12-21 02:22:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins Save It Senator, You Are Finished.
943852664277872640 2017-12-21 14:36:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @chrislhayes @MarionBurr5 @ASlavitt You did a great job Andy.
943852096788590597 2017-12-21 14:34:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato Wow, Ole Tomi pretty much sums up everything you need to know about the Cons. They can trigger this snowflake all day long, he who laughs last, laughs the loudest. Cons have a lot of bad stuff coming their way, MAGA THAT YAll.
943826637417742338 2017-12-21 12:53:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @SafetyPinDaily Seriously this dude seems so DUMB.
943825303394234369 2017-12-21 12:47:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @NaomioftheNorth @Liconn54 Liz shes not dim, shes complicit. She too is compromised by the GD Russians. Putin funded her campaign. She supports Russian position and trump. No green minded anything would support trump. Hes raping our country every day.
943824619840077825 2017-12-21 12:44:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorTimScott @Mandabald @southern_brand @a_millie513 @bananawrist @dem_deplorable Are you like a JOKE of an account? The crosses, the MAGA Crap. You might want to check your tax situation as Im guessing you dont make enough to benefit from the Tax Scam.  But I guess hating a Black dude is more important, Enjoy your increase!
943823169303011328 2017-12-21 12:39:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 @SenatorTimScott @bananawrist Much sooner than that for many.
943822866507796481 2017-12-21 12:38:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorTimScott @EPMIJLP @keysdiver76 Oh I missed that, was it on RT?
943820085742927872 2017-12-21 12:26:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @owillis @khwalz @ryan_gunther Doug winning is huge. Whether you recognize it or not. Perhaps youve never been to Alabama.
943819643491319808 2017-12-21 12:25:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @owillis @khwalz Yes Karen its that or get used to the regular raping that the Right Wing Nut Jobs Are subjecting us to. RESIST.
943817704015790080 2017-12-21 12:17:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdHull8 More and more Authoritarian every damn day. MAGAt

943816121068736512 2017-12-21 12:11:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @fittys @nowthisnews My God Sleaze Bags Paul Ryan and Mike Pence literally make my skin crawl. The way they consistently use their Christian faith to swindle Americans is repulsive. MAGAt
943814327961882624 2017-12-21 12:04:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @intelligencer @jptrib1 These MFers are just sick. I cant wait to see their heads roll.
943813707880189952 2017-12-21 12:01:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @KBAndersen @vickizun @stevenkane @peterkohan If this shitbag bill lasts that long (Dems will vote it out when we retake power) in 10 years 50% Of Americans will pay more taxes. Ultimately, 83% Of decrease goes to top 1%. MAGA.
943812797841924096 2017-12-21 11:58:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @KBAndersen @vickizun @stevenkane Wrong. Theyre going down for the rich. Do you actually believe that trump and cast of crooks raised their own taxes? You got swindled Steven, MAGAt.
943812079844233216 2017-12-21 11:55:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @KBAndersen @stevenkane Guess youre slow, they did not raise taxes on the rich. They raised them on the poor and middle class. MAGA (My Ass Got Arrested)
943811544164466688 2017-12-21 11:53:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @fritchee @KBAndersen MAGA!!! Hate to say it (not really) but I really hope he voted for Dumb-Dumb Dotard Donnie.
943810785876303873 2017-12-21 11:50:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein @VicStoddard @IH8Traitors Im sure he used his go-to: I was just joking
943810592615354369 2017-12-21 11:49:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein @IH8Traitors @VicStoddard Not in a million.
943810477142040576 2017-12-21 11:48:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein I guess youre referring to his followers not caring because those of us who are Woke, care a great deal. Hes the biggest hateful bigot crook ever to step foot in the White House. MAGAt
943685437520056320 2017-12-20 03:31:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepJackyRosen @RedTRaccoon @docholly Those are some really happy f***s!
943648484640555008 2017-12-20 01:05:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @BruceBartlett @EMTP513 Certainly not only Corker. Plenty of pork in that barrel. Theyre all beholden to Big Industry dollars and they came to collect on their investments. Without industry $$ Cons have no dough.
943647670169718785 2017-12-20 01:01:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @SunflowerSoul71 @BruceBartlett Shes a Con, shes in the right place. I think McConnell probably threatened the crap out of her. Mainers are pissed, shell pay with her seat.
943646987668348928 2017-12-20 00:59:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @NaomioftheNorth Dont you think its trumps?
943592280040132608 2017-12-20 21:21:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson They are vicious and going for the jugular because their lives depend on it. We get it and we know youre one of the good guys. Im sorry to hear about their attacks but not st all surprised. Their KGB Dirty. RESIST. Mueller stays or we move as one United force.
943589863135248384 2017-12-20 21:12:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @NaomioftheNorth Lifelong Dem here, not changing as I still agree with their philosophy on most things. However, DC is a cesspool of corruption. Citizens United, foreign money, LLC crap, and lifelong runs in Congress must end to clean it up for real this time. Lobbyists& self dealing over too.
943505203424321541 2017-12-20 15:35:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @NaomioftheNorth Wait I forgot to mention conspiring with our enemies to steal the presidency with the obvious help from FBI trumplandia crooks to coerce Comey to take HRC (which worked).
943504138897428483 2017-12-20 15:31:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @omarvaid @deanofcomedy Hell No!
943503526726131712 2017-12-20 15:29:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @NathanHRubin They blame them. They call themselves Prosperity Christians That way they absolve themselves from any compassion for the poor. Its a gross perversion if Christianity. Its the ISIS of Christianity. MAGA
943499723310292994 2017-12-20 15:13:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @NaomioftheNorth They went for super rich, Crazy Religious Right and bigots. A winning combo in the short term, not so much in the long term. Now that Dems and Independents get it and are truly Woke let the best people win.
943497043913437185 2017-12-20 15:03:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr GREAT IDEA MITCHY, another line of work is exactly what youre going to get!
943494838867066880 2017-12-20 14:54:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @NaomioftheNorth Well they pretty much needed the votes so.... really decent people would not vote for this crap.
943494198715666432 2017-12-20 14:52:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepErikPaulsen @RWPUSA @amiejennifer Ill call you with a Rand Paul and trump you with a Mitch McConnell. I like to call that a Royal Flush Of SHIT senators.
943493601421594624 2017-12-20 14:49:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Exactly right Sir, bye bye Cons.

943465298753146880 2017-12-20 12:57:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @JoyAnnReid @JohnOSullivan36 I disagree. Before 8-11-16, I would have said they were racist self-serving liars. Exactly what has changed?
943461570457358336 2017-12-20 12:42:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @brian_wooley @mattyglesias @Brookssista1 I totally agree. Its a big time pay day for the Crooked Cons. I consider it a completely undeserved severance package.
943459415239352321 2017-12-20 12:33:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepMarkMeadows FU Mark.

943296437252689921 2017-12-19 01:46:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins Poor Susan got her little feelings hurt today saying that her coverage was sexist. Better get used to it Suzy Q because its all down hill from here. Its simple, do the right thing or pay the price. MAGA THAT!

943292680997621761 2017-12-19 01:31:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @TheRickyDavila Me too. The worst ones are those who pretended to be better and then werent.  I prefer the lying, cheating, self-serving scoundrels at least have the decency to be up front about it.
943287570569547776 2017-12-19 01:10:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Go Repugs!!!

943195825898950656 2017-12-19 19:06:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @PressSec @tedlieu Cons are busy lying about Mueller and if we dont step it up, theyll probably pull it off. The time for decorum is OVER. Its time to save our Democracy or except this Oligarchy for what it is. Please speak to colleagues!
943195233818480640 2017-12-19 19:04:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @PressSec @tedlieu TRUTH. Thank you Sir for being a Dem with some moxie. Please talk to other Dems about speaking out more. Dems need that desperately now. We know what this is. Its time to say it. You all need to say it now!
943194343027986432 2017-12-19 19:00:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @HoneyDemForce @TeamPelosi You bet your sweet bippy Rep Pelosi. Like the scarlet letter they do richly deserve. Please step up your speaking out. Dems need leaders, be one! If Dems did what Cons are doing they would eat us alive with sound bites! Where are ours??? Brand It Already!!!
943193193243344896 2017-12-19 18:55:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @malynresists Oh, he colludes with Captains of Industry to help them do away with all regs so that rich people get richer and poor people die from environmental toxins. #MAGA
943192656150237184 2017-12-19 18:53:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @dumptrump33 Graham has really taken a serious dive into that swamp hasnt he? Once you go swamp, its OVER.
943191903490670592 2017-12-19 18:50:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlanDersh Sure, in what way Alan? You are a turncoat.

943190468443156480 2017-12-19 18:45:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @RepDanKildee Well they lie as easily as they breath. As if Dems would have signed off on the DonorTaxScam anyway.
943177159321030657 2017-12-19 17:52:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNNPolitics @jaketapper Sad. Repugs have zero loyalty. Its each man for himself. Lord of the Flies.

943167372030038017 2017-12-19 17:13:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @TheRickyDavila All So True. Theyre despicable. I, for one, will never forget.
943144397436342272 2017-12-19 15:42:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @peterdaou @AnneWorner Oh hes a good catholic boy.
943144133488672768 2017-12-19 15:40:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @peterdaou Repulsive but very much in keeping with who hes always been. Hes a wolf in sheeps clothing.

943099910697684992 2017-12-19 12:45:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @JayCaruso @TPOTEfan Not legally elected. Appointed by Putin also lost by 3M votes. Wake up already.
943098652813295619 2017-12-19 12:40:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @SethAbramson @KsaraseraSara Pretty sure the answer is no. If it could dumb-dumb would have actually done that on day one.
943082294272839680 2017-12-19 11:35:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @SethAbramson @KsaraseraSara Im not 100% sure of that answer but I think its true. Having majority in all three just doesnt happen all that often. After all of this crap, youd think we could take all three.
943081670881792005 2017-12-19 11:32:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba Yes Im sure they both secretly suffer from black soul disease.

942972310834876417 2017-12-18 04:18:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Im going with the Stein.

942950909885255682 2017-12-18 02:53:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @JeffFlake Screw You too Flake. Crooked self-serving Con. What happened to the dribble you put in your book? You people are so much worse than deplorable.

942945494585741312 2017-12-18 02:31:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @Indyvoter707 Theyd just call it a nightmare and keep stealing from the working stiffs.

942927736888229889 2017-12-18 01:21:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @SethAbramson @macrowe Thanks sorry
942927175002607616 2017-12-18 01:18:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @4everNeverTrump @oufenix No, hes not a tool. Hes a CROOK.
942926925584109570 2017-12-18 01:17:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr God You Are so Completly Gross. Unfortunately you are my Senator and I will be working against you in 2020. Ps We All Know Youre GAY!!!!
942926355682988032 2017-12-18 01:15:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @KamalaHarris @SenSanders @maziehirono @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @KilloughCNN @NiravaSara Yes however I do (kind of) understand they wanted moral high ground however I dont think its going to force any better behavior from the Cons so I rather miss the point. Al was a breath of fresh air and what he supposedly did was not especially bad to me.
942924550743969792 2017-12-18 01:08:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @SethAbramson @macrowe Sorry again but what exactly do I click?

942922249836908544 2017-12-18 00:59:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @SethAbramson @macrowe Pardon my ignorance but how do I do that?
942922073651007488 2017-12-18 00:58:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @SethAbramson @macrowe Ok
942921916326776832 2017-12-18 00:57:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @chelseahandler @SethAbramson @drivr3g Youre really gross too!

942921182906671104 2017-12-18 00:55:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @SethAbramson @KsaraseraSara Wed need majority in both houses and Presidency so wed better win and win big.
942920817972842496 2017-12-18 00:53:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @SethAbramson @macrowe Youre delusional if you believe thats any more likely than this DonorTaxPlan not passing.
942919882424889344 2017-12-18 00:49:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @SethAbramson Ummm come Seth, they didnt ask for it, they demanded it!

Many R Congressman are obviously complicit. I love Al too & even rather agree with your position but really, get real already.
942916645504380928 2017-12-18 00:37:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @AHamiltonSpirit @fishergirlusmc Nut Job. Guess you didnt hear about two guys with big charges and two others who copped pleas and have flipped on trump & co (admitting guilt) wake up Laura!
942890591377149952 2017-12-18 22:53:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenJeffMerkley I love you Senator but the thoughts and prayers thing is just so RepubliKlan.

942846425377005569 2017-12-18 19:57:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @PunishPence @DelayKathleen Oh you mean like RepubliKlans? Yes, very true!
942843008340373504 2017-12-18 19:44:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @sahilkapur No its a really F Ed up agenda.
942841979272093696 2017-12-18 19:40:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @Pol0tix @axeldig How about obstruction of justice, perjury, money laundering/racketeering for starters?  They are as dirty as dirty gets. If you are naive enough to cont to support the Dotard and fellow criminals then youre in for a rude awakening.
942840226602475526 2017-12-18 19:33:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidHaroldFin2 @RobbieResister What I need to do that to my mother in law.
942836714522980352 2017-12-18 19:19:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @ColSand42 God me too. Nauseous, pissed, scared and embarrassed. Hes SO BAD!
942835899972374528 2017-12-18 19:16:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @tak_twitt @KathyDuke65 RepubliKlans are ruthless self-absorbed SOB! Yes they knew, they all knew. Many Rs in congress appear to be complicit having assoc and taken Russian Rubles.
942834700816715776 2017-12-18 19:11:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @Pol0tix @RedFocus5 Jevankas? Oh thats way down the list but Mueller will get to them eventually.
942833496086720512 2017-12-18 19:06:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnCornyn Seriously, wtf kind of response is that? Oh yea, RepubliKlan!
942830415185960960 2017-12-18 18:54:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @Pol0tix Two charged, two copping pleas and turning on trump. Not a hard question. Many more to come, ENJOY!!!
942756905897906176 2017-12-18 14:02:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @jacklgoldsmith Another major flaw, it assumes trump may be exonerated. Hes guilty as sin and Mueller knows it. This is why trump will fire him. Just wait until Jared gets the call or jr, its coming.!
942753791262232576 2017-12-18 13:49:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedTRaccoon @JenTromans The pain initially is unbearable. Hugging your kids is good and keeping busy with them. In my darkest times, work and kids helped the most. Its the quiet times that are worst. With you in spirit Jennifer.
942740031994847232 2017-12-18 12:55:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedTRaccoon @JenTromans So, so sorry to hear, thats tragic. Take time to find your footing again and then that anger to help you fight the fight.

942732997987651584 2017-12-18 12:27:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuddLegum Ted is a hater. Jr has bad veneers. Theyre both RepubliKlans.

942617292084563968 2017-12-17 04:47:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @tak_twitt @KathyDuke65 Oh yes plenty of failure to be around but all media outlets presented trump/Clinton as though they were equal candidates. Gave trump tons of free air time

941709684943224834 2017-12-15 16:40:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman Sure Ronna, have you any swamp land in Florida youd like to sell? What the hell happened to the Romney? Talk about a sell out....

941694471841943555 2017-12-15 15:40:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub Oh god that  Gaetz guy what a slime ball. Who in the hell eoukd even consider voting for him. I think there should be some serious time-outs on voters who vote for terrible people.
941325454933463041 2017-12-14 15:14:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper Oh look at that sweet little face, you can see the love just oozing from her. This makes me cry.

941299908241436672 2017-12-14 13:32:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper You make a good point Jake But the tides have turned and we will continue to rise and resist.
941298290796236800 2017-12-14 13:26:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @cheriebibo @TPThompson2 Pretty sure thats totally true.
941296243208318976 2017-12-14 13:18:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jim_Jordan Freedom Caucus does that refer to freedom from rational thought? No evidence from Mueller. Three indictments and just getting started oh yea, dont forget Flynn flipped big time. You Cons are going down. We see you crooks & were over it. Better start praying Jim.

941034782397550597 2017-12-13 19:59:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @g1gary @SenBillNelson Gee I wonder which oligarch demanded that?

940988836208930817 2017-12-13 16:56:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Theyre pretty much always both IMO.
940955920309342208 2017-12-13 14:45:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @LeftOfMainSt Really, remember what he did to Romney (which was painfully obvious, even way back then) Lindsey is not very smart.
940955221722914821 2017-12-13 14:43:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @radioman99 @The1TrueCraig Guessing its a pee tape of a different nature.
940954938611560448 2017-12-13 14:41:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Hey Linda, suck up much? You have really allowed yourself to be played by this Con Man. Remember what you said about trump being the R candidate? You were right, you do deserve it all right. ENJOY!!!
940953104706691072 2017-12-13 14:34:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @wlawren90 @bootguy_paul @PaulRizzo504 Yes obviously true. Dems are moving left, which is fine with me to an extent. Closing down trade helps nobody. Trade goes both ways and we continue to need that. Trump didnt capitalize on that, Bannon did. Trump is a total Con Man who is also a Mobster. A class A Grifter.
940951499491901442 2017-12-13 14:28:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @wlawren90 @bootguy_paul @PaulRizzo504 Dems have been complacent (me included) for far too long. We are now woke. Seeing dumb-dumb as President has been a major awakening for many of us. The DNC is just trying to get up to speed. I wish Mayor Pete had gotten the DNC job though.
940950807691825152 2017-12-13 14:25:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @wlawren90 @bootguy_paul @PaulRizzo504 Hehe Virginia not Virgins.

940949813373407232 2017-12-13 14:21:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @wlawren90 @bootguy_paul @PaulRizzo504 Folks in the rust belt (Im from Gary IN) chose to believe a hateful snake oil salesman that demonized immigrants, blacks, US trade policy,  and women. Automation is what has made the biggest difference in our productivity. That too is progress we must adapt or perish.
940948475549835264 2017-12-13 14:16:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @wlawren90 @bootguy_paul @PaulRizzo504 Yea, he blames any number of groups. Bernie supporters are a bit extreme in my opinion. Bernie has some good sound bites and not much of a plan. Dems must be a big tent party or well be divided like the hateful Cons. RESIST.
940944744217219073 2017-12-13 14:01:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @wlawren90 @bootguy_paul @PaulRizzo504 Key point here Paul, the 80s. The Clintons have evolved and acknowledged their past mistakes on this front. Thats a lot more than many others have done. In the 80s, I was a college co-ed. Today Im a grandma, things change, so do people.
940942786395766784 2017-12-13 13:53:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @wlawren90 No Will, he supported HRC yes, he does point out crap that helped defeat her (wrongly) many Dems agree with him. We are over the misogyny crap Will & over Bernie the NON-Dem Dem too.
940941437440585730 2017-12-13 13:48:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @TalbertSwan Exactly right Bishop.
940939798004600832 2017-12-13 13:41:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @Evan_McMullin I hope for the latter. They should just change their name to the HATER party.  We hate everybody but ourselves, you dont like it, Screw You
940939276757422080 2017-12-13 13:39:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @omarvaid Go Omar!!!!
940939059765104641 2017-12-13 13:38:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @NatashaBertrand @coopersam339 Ok I take it back, you do live in a vacuum. We all use oil in this country. What happens if there is no oil to burn? What happens if oil goes up to 8$ a gallon? Hence, we support Mid-East peace, get it?
940935093316702208 2017-12-13 13:23:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @NatashaBertrand @coopersam339 Sam thats ridiculous, we dont live in a vacuum. Where do you think we get all of the oil we consume? Mid-East peace serves us bud, wake up.
940933867703296000 2017-12-13 13:18:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @NatashaBertrand Hey great job Jared!!!! Hows your Mid-East coming along?
940932845434032135 2017-12-13 13:14:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Well youre pretty much an expert on becoming a joke. (Dotard its Media)

940795101814681600 2017-12-12 04:06:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Bummer dumb-dumb. Turns out even folks in Bama dont go for sexual molesters and pedophiles. Dons days are numbered.

940714615264239616 2017-12-12 22:46:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @WomanMDsGuide @SeanMcElwee Dont know about Dems being deviants either but at least we hold ours accountable. The Radical Right has Mob Standards, its disgusting.
940713790466912256 2017-12-12 22:43:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump @RepCummings Regular Order, Regular order great job Sir, its time Sir, its past time. Give them hell. Hold them accountable.
940712258921025538 2017-12-12 22:37:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Yea it doesnt pass the smell test. Stone and Hannity, I definitely smell a rat. Could it be any more suspicious. Two from the crazy radical right, willing to say or do anything for a win. Swine.
940711302774841344 2017-12-12 22:33:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @AprilDRyan Do you know this CBC, set it up, Ill meet with them

940682251737673729 2017-12-12 20:38:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @RonWyden Foul. Beneath the dignity of the presidency says it all. Everyday he denigrates the office along with his damn thugs. We must hold him accountable while we still can!

940569144906444800 2017-12-12 13:08:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @jasoninthehouse Yes isnt that just terrible. What a missed opportunity to make a big huge issue of nothing. Saw you on Lou Dobbs last, didnt think you could get any worse but I was wrong! You suck!
940567436184752128 2017-12-12 13:02:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @MrRobotCodeBrkr We also stand for civil rights and womens rights.
940567240319078401 2017-12-12 13:01:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @MrRobotCodeBrkr Ive been hearing this quite a bit lately. I basically reject it. Dems support many things that benefit Black and other people of less privilege. Healthcare, job retraining, entitlements, affirmative action, Regs to protect environment, financial protections, school loans, ACLU.
940561510660739072 2017-12-12 12:38:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Shouldnt be too hard to find the dirt on that slime ball.

940280365876432896 2017-12-11 18:01:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @USDOT @SenSchumer @LonginoD Funny I looked at your first two posts and they are anti vaccine. So that proves youre not particularly interested in science or actual research/facts. So you know what, shut the F Up.
940257649622503425 2017-12-11 16:31:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @KellyannePolls @FoxNews The only thing they truly respect is their own ability to profit off of the trump admin.

940243390918266880 2017-12-11 15:34:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @USDOT @SenSchumer @rocksiphone Funny is Mueller investigating that too? Bahahaha NOT TRUE!
940242877095006208 2017-12-11 15:32:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @USDOT @SenSchumer @LonginoD Yes so true because as a consumer I really resent regulations that protect my often over-looked Rights. Its important that Companies are allowed to screw the little people every chance they get.

939889555993440256 2017-12-10 16:08:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Sandy81798642 @sandboxpete No never. Theyve been selfish and self-absorbed for my entire adult life. They used to try and hide it somewhat, now they dont even bother.

939856013838008320 2017-12-10 13:55:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @kayleighmcenany He needs to proclaim theses two simple words to you Kayleigh, youre fired.
939854426034106370 2017-12-10 13:48:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Brasilmagic @Rangerlora Really, Id say for a Con, shes one of the better ones. At Least she voted down the ACA repeal.

He must be shunned and voted down. Hes despicable and Even Alabama knows that. Doug Jones for Senate. Hes actually a good guy, this is a no brainer AlABAMA VOTE JONES
939581164393844737 2017-12-09 19:43:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @DeeDeeSchwartz3 @badwebsites Yes, it was so obvious she was being 100% honest. It was disgusting. They acted as though she was lying and not trust worthy, it was completely wrong. He too just kept denying the truth and payed zero price for abusive behavior. Thomas should not be in Traffic Court.
939546234557206528 2017-12-09 17:24:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP @andylassner The hate just radiates right out of this guy. A very common thing in trumprussia. Bannon, Flynn, Gorka, Jr, Jevanka, Pence, Manafort, Kelly, Stone, miller, trump and Putin. Thats a whole lot of Hate.
939506909081690112 2017-12-09 14:47:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @BanditRandom @lilbobby37 They would have started Impeachment proceedings before he exited the building. This is Not Normal.

939496212885069825 2017-12-09 14:05:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @Brookssista1 No doubt about it. That is when the non-deluded among us much demand that this traitor and the fellow crooks in WH and congress be impeached and imprisoned.

939205601816731648 2017-12-08 18:50:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @RonWyden Congress had better not let this happen or the Traitors will be met with Fire & Fury, the likes of which the world has never known.  We must support the rule of law before they do any more damage. Theyre working against our Great Country.

Let trump fire him and you will have Armageddon on your hands and you Cons will more than deserve it. Youre going down.

938895882652737537 2017-12-07 22:19:56 UTC <HenslerKate> Its not just us who needs it, our Democracy needs it. Id say it depends on it. Democrats, demand an independent committee, demand this admin be frozen. This Despot is raping our country every damn day. Stop It Now. We will support you!
938894629180755968 2017-12-07 22:14:58 UTC <HenslerKate> Rep Trent Franks resigning because of inappropriate behavior. What do you suppose the tea party conservative was into?

Of all the times to ditch the Dems because we are not perfect, please. Were 95 % better than the Cons so you choose. Not perfect or Deplorable. Unless youre filthy rich, they could care less about you. I smell Russians again!!!

938868403460345857 2017-12-07 20:30:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @ezlusztig READY. Been ready since January 20th. Lets do this.
938863401048117249 2017-12-07 20:10:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Wow how about like a Jewish baker making a cake with a cross in it. The ignorance is real.
938822915725971456 2017-12-07 17:30:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven @ezlusztig Hate to say but I agree. Not that Ill vote Republican ever! I wouldnt have done that before trump but certainly NOT after.
938822027246473216 2017-12-07 17:26:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenGillibrand Guess what, Im out too. First you turn on Clinton & now Franken. I would have considered voting for you in 2020 but now, Ill write in HRC if need be.  Youre Puritanical position is too much for me.
938814149496369152 2017-12-07 16:55:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA No I am not. Im only disgusted with your sleaze ball party.

938801625870761986 2017-12-07 16:05:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @rosato1030 I SO agree, hes sleazier than the sleaziest used car salesman.

938785382468149253 2017-12-07 15:00:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @johnlundin Yes, thats as it should be. I dont buy Pences holier than though routine at all. Hes a snake if there ever was one.
938775831215853568 2017-12-07 14:22:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesPPierce @RaeAnnEmerySAG 100.% believed her too. It was a travesty.
938775145962987521 2017-12-07 14:20:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @SamEllison11 @CharlesPPierce I know its ridiculous. As if Bill invented this crap. Thomas never should have made it in.
938774650481532928 2017-12-07 14:18:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @letahamilton383 @NickKristof Oh yes, the mighty fall from grace. Just being International jet setters wasnt enough. Rich does not equal smart. Particularly true when laundering dirty money is your primary source of income.
938773913034780674 2017-12-07 14:15:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckGrassley Hey Chuck maybe you should resign and go see a movie or something. AMEN to THAT!
938769807905869824 2017-12-07 13:58:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdanClay No but I do think most rank and file Dems feel pretty United. Its about the big stuff for me, you know, like Russian infiltration, not Fake groping pics of a comedian touching a RW radio show host fake boobs.
938757287719718912 2017-12-07 13:09:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @AndreaChalupa @sarahkendzior I love Obama, many of us were listening & heard both he and HRC but he should have stood up to McConnell. That SOB called his bluff. Russian infiltration in our Democracy warranted DRAMA.
938745296393302017 2017-12-07 12:21:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @radiochick841 Because they deny it

938739976602292224 2017-12-07 12:00:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Were you expecting something else? That ship sailed a long time ago.
938725068468781057 2017-12-07 11:01:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @BruceBartlett I agree and Im tired of it. Guess they never heard nice guys finish last We need to wake up and fight while we still have part of a  Democracy to fight for.
938724374286348288 2017-12-07 10:58:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @travitt @MrRobotCodeBrkr Where was the outrage about Charlottesville from the Reich (Right)? Or regarding any of his other many offenses?
938723322883293184 2017-12-07 10:54:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @UnkleNeal As apposed to a hater who votes against every bill that would actually help poor folks in Alabama. Something tells me if they try it, theyll like it. As if Sessions cared about real Alabamians? Or McConnell Kentuckians?
938721952004374528 2017-12-07 10:48:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @travitt @MrRobotCodeBrkr The same stuff I find repugnant, they find entertaining.
938721425124483072 2017-12-07 10:46:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @travitt @MrRobotCodeBrkr I think plenty of them have the good sense to keep their mouths shut about it BUT  plenty of them deep down dont have any particular problem with it. Hence all of the resentment about being politically correct. I did not realize this initially but yes I believe it now.
938629336055328768 2017-12-06 04:40:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr Bahaha Jr, probably not your smartest tweet. Bahahaha.
938590450612654080 2017-12-06 02:06:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MrRobotCodeBrkr I suppose. This seems to be much more extreme for me. Something about the conspiring with the Russians    to steal Pres P grabber And all of the horrible things the Cons have done has really made me militant.
938587564168052739 2017-12-06 01:54:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MrRobotCodeBrkr How so?
938587269048528896 2017-12-06 01:53:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MrRobotCodeBrkr Yes, I must admit I too am more radical than Ive ever been. Turns out I feel pretty strongly about our Democracy. Not cool with Mobsters selling it to the highest bidder.
938586719015899136 2017-12-06 01:51:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MrRobotCodeBrkr Yes, the level of destructive Fake News on Hillary was off the charts and so many believed it. Faux News, Rush, Breitbart, lying Repugs with endless fake investigations worked. The News sources need to be shut down.
938584561272938496 2017-12-06 01:42:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MrRobotCodeBrkr Same idiot (who is related by marriage) also has quit watching football because of the knee thing, so you tell me.
938583764749508608 2017-12-06 01:39:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MrRobotCodeBrkr I know a few of them, I just dont get that at all. One said I voted for a change but acknowledged hed made big mistake.
938576412268691456 2017-12-06 01:10:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MrRobotCodeBrkr He opened his campaign with Im getting rid of the drug/rapist Mexicans hard not to catch his meaning Id say. They may not admit it, but they heard it. Also he was a relentless Birther so ...BS.
938574266471211008 2017-12-06 01:01:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MrRobotCodeBrkr Not what I see. Im not sure Racism is something people are indifferent about. If they were indifferent, dont you think wed be hearing from some who are disturbed about it? CRICKETS.
938566604794810369 2017-12-06 00:31:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk @MaryAliceBisho2 More like CRIMINAL Id say.
938566050098139136 2017-12-06 00:29:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk World class negotiator Jared also Believed that Dems would be happy about trump firing Comey. How did that go? He also backed Flynn. Hes not exactly batting 1000 here.
938560966790471680 2017-12-06 00:09:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @MrRobotCodeBrkr I think a pretty high percentage on some kind of continuum. From somewhat Racist to full on White Supremacist thats what they really like about trump. Sorry to say but I believe it to be true.
938558254917017600 2017-12-06 23:58:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @constantbarrage @kylegriffin1 Oh wow, isnt that just fabulous. If their toxic everything, authoritarian govt. or extremist judges dont kill you, their out of control guns will. RESIST
938555803446992896 2017-12-06 23:48:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Yes Hope, Gig is up. Dont sacrifice yourself for these despicable Cons. They dont deserve it and youll pay a huge price. Flip or youre F-ed.
938553397338353664 2017-12-06 23:39:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @AriMelber @Lis_Smith Saw you. I dont agree with your hardline position on Franken. My 27 year old my single educated daughter doesnt either. FYI its not cut/dry for all Dems.
938551942946705408 2017-12-06 23:33:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @cherokeesher2 @SenFranken @FaithHopeJoyLuv @FemNurse I agree. This is no time to become puritanical we need our soldiers. Despite Frankens slip ups hes been a leader & we need him. Hes been petting Not pedophilingl. Trump, Moore, Farenthold. All much worse.
938547636054917122 2017-12-06 23:16:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @Stowydad @MPRnews @SenFranken @ccluster99 @zandze @JNReinertson @GwendolynLemley Bahahaha RepubliKlan with integrity? Havent seen one of those for quite some time. This is war for our Democracy.  You dont give up a General to prove to your enemy youre the good one.
938486436084486144 2017-12-06 19:12:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @j_breents Why the F is Jevanka in charge of the MidEast negotiations? Why did he meet Saudi Prince (just made himself King) and sell him many weapons? How much do you think the Mobsters in the WH made off of that deal? Hey State-Oh Yea. RESIST
938481232094121984 2017-12-06 18:52:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @JonRiley7 @ExGOPgirl @BanksClan NO.
938481074124017664 2017-12-06 18:51:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @JonRiley7 @ExGOPgirl Same for me. While what he did (accused) is not the same as what the others have done. Arent we the party of grey? Leave the black /white to the Repugs.
938479973853212674 2017-12-06 18:47:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @JonRiley7 I disagree. So far, all Im believing is he put his hand on some ladys butts while taking pics. While thats not cool its not molesting either.
938448421370978305 2017-12-06 16:41:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @Noahbierman @adamshermanesq @ByBrianBennett Sorry its been completely worthless for months. They just lie, it should not be rewarded by having press there.

938430245891461121 2017-12-06 15:29:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @KellyannePolls @olgaNYC1211 Shes so gross. She and her fellow Hate club members in the Council for National Party need to be publicly shamed for plotting against our countrys interests in the name of patriotism. Bannon, Conway, Mercers, need I say more?

938391116059115520 2017-12-06 12:54:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton They dont call them the GOP Grand Old Pedophiles for nothing.
938237024556998661 2017-12-05 02:41:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @grajillas No but some sure will Crap on your rights in an effort to shove their strongly held beliefs down your throat.
938234109310259200 2017-12-05 02:30:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @grajillas Good one, yea I wasnt serious. Im guessing your dog is a better Christian.

938226222949072897 2017-12-05 01:58:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @SethAbramson Which show?
938225992849612800 2017-12-05 01:58:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Yes as long as the Evangelicals reign supreme over everybody else. Thats clearly the new world order in this admin. Because trump is Evangelical you know.
938224038698258438 2017-12-05 01:50:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyOShea @JRubinBlogger Bet that makes you SO sad that you left the RepubliKlan party. You are far too rational, articulate & decent to have been in that party. Im glad youve seen the light.
938184579793543170 2017-12-05 23:13:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders It a huge room size vat of pork. Middle class tax cut my ass. Donor class tax scam is Disgusting. Tells you all you need to know about Cons.
938079593768144896 2017-12-05 16:16:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @E8Delilah @sloviesays Bahaha me too but trust me my husband and daughter will be with us. Did you go to DC for Womens March? It was awesome. Millennials will represent-theyre pAst this Crap.
938077916549619713 2017-12-05 16:09:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @sloviesays @E8Delilah I get it-just concerned that not enough will resist. Im kind of hoping he fired Mueller because it could put an end to this BS. Cons are Cons who will do anything. It must stop.
938075128793092098 2017-12-05 15:58:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @sloviesays @E8Delilah None of us really do but it sure as hell beats the alternative. RESIST

938045079469600768 2017-12-05 13:59:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @SymoneDSanders @flywithkamala @schmermund_k Yes but, he and that female R on morning joe still consider themselves RepubliKlans so what does that tell you? Talk is cheap.
938044573900820481 2017-12-05 13:57:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @SymoneDSanders After trump, absolutely nothing surprises me at all. Moore is no worse than trump, hes just a southern fried trump.
938043777599594496 2017-12-05 13:53:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @JonJusth @bannerite Just Pence is a deal breaker on Christianity for me, then throw in the Hateful Evangelicals and its a life-time Ban in organized religion.
938036281463967744 2017-12-05 13:24:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @Indyvoter707 @TrickFreee They are correct in doing so.

938019300736151553 2017-12-05 12:16:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @Morning_Joe @stavridisj @JonJusth @ColMorrisDavis This is Autocratic move, isnt that obvious?
938015195112378369 2017-12-05 12:00:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @Dixiepro I was there, for the record, it was awesome. I need an infusion though, my resolve is wearing thin.
938014833789865984 2017-12-05 11:58:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @Dixiepro I couldnt agree more David. Its So damn bad. Has he gaslighted or warm down do many that theyve given up? I believe its up to the people now or were doomed to live in trumpdumb. Lets move already.

937885151039717376 2017-12-04 03:23:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @BruceBartlett No way. Our system routinely convicts people who are much more diminished and you certainly know that.

937857859831902208 2017-12-04 01:35:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @The_UnSilent_ For real, it was so obvious that trump was just making him grovel so that he could then shame him by not choosing him. Then as soon as the Russian Rexon connection was public, his obvious choice. If we could only figure out why 
937850811404767234 2017-12-04 01:07:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheJusticeDept @pouts @BarackObama @MikePhillips65 Truth hurts.

937765816342384640 2017-12-04 19:29:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @bryanbehar @SpiritedIdeals All for it but something tells me he would. He represents him doesnt he?
937761440156520449 2017-12-04 19:12:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @bryanbehar Now Ray, in all fairness, trump launders dirty Russian Rubles like a champ. Dont you sell him short.
937761182638845953 2017-12-04 19:11:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @bryanbehar Oh but wait Kellyanne backed up Dowds story. Bahahaha how ridiculous.

They went to the women, women did not go to them. Women did not know one another. Some voted for trump. Moore like young girls-common knowledge. He did it! Are you a Bot?

937705254342324226 2017-12-04 15:28:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @BateThb Got ya, makes sense.
937703878174367744 2017-12-04 15:23:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @Discon1948 @cassandra17lina And lies as easily as he breaths. Dowd looks like a walking heart attack.
937702872225144835 2017-12-04 15:19:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @BateThb I dont believe its backbone they lack. Its Integrity. They have tons of backbone, they lie, cheat, obstruct, conspire very well, all require plenty of backbone. What Republicans in Congress lack is some old fashioned Integity.

937684214312562688 2017-12-04 14:05:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @Varidienne Lets hit the streets. Why are we just sitting back and letting the RussianRepubliklan party get away with this? It is a despicable tax scam that we MUST stop. His tweets are distracting from the true crimes happening right before our eyes.
937683047796936704 2017-12-04 14:00:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @FBI @maggieNYT @kaitlancollins @gwenmoritz @patton_amye I guess youre not referring to Kellyanne herself?
937677584699133958 2017-12-04 13:38:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @2HawkEye2018 @allenemies4n Well some of the dumb asses will help to pay for it, they just dont know it yet. Its not official yet. How do you think the Rs would handle huge protests. Too much distraction from his stupid tweets!
937675782092197889 2017-12-04 13:31:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @Jamie_Maz @shoreboy1961 @NoteFromSELF Totally agree with you. If people choose to remain in the closet, fine, thats their right. But the gay bashing part is despicable. Remember Rev Ted Haggard?
937673667416330240 2017-12-04 13:23:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram @Mikel_Jollett Grassley statement was really pretty crazy.
937672593229918211 2017-12-04 13:19:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @RayRLibrandi @KangasMom1 He was the leader of the National Association Of Evangelicals when scandal broke. Hes very effeminate to say the least.
937671803878731776 2017-12-04 13:15:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @RayRLibrandi @KangasMom1 Oh that was a flagship case. He was Evangelical Leader!

937670936861569026 2017-12-04 13:12:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @keithboykin @LaMonica @LisaRGaffney @RyanWelchko @EatonRifles1 @pestleperson Lizard eyes to me. They even move like lizard eyes.

937670331397033984 2017-12-04 13:10:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @MadYellowDog @keithboykin Id say Kushner was a double agent Israel/Russia (he likes those Rubles too).
937669731393425408 2017-12-04 13:07:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @KangasMom1 @RayRLibrandi Brings to mind the disgusting fallen from grace Reverend Ted Haggard. That was a really extreme case.
937668876799823872 2017-12-04 13:04:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @dog_in_clouds @Monkey64184351 How about how many of these creeps have Russian/USSR wives? Its pretty telling.
937667911828869120 2017-12-04 13:00:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @KangasMom1 @RayRLibrandi Oh my, Im starting to think a higher % of these guys are closeted gays than in general population.

937496116903530496 2017-12-03 01:37:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @mkraju @harrisonmarkey @rtdonovan11 Yes I know hes dirty, just hope hes outed for it. Hes a crook for sure. He couldnt care less about Kentuckians, its so wrong. Hes been spending Rubles for awhile, as hAve many of the GOP.
937480937729921024 2017-12-03 00:37:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulsperry_ @rishio95 I know who Sasser is, hes a nut job. No Thanks. I like real intellectuals.
937476647418253312 2017-12-03 00:20:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Dowd looks like Hitchcock after a serious Bender.

937410820111298560 2017-12-03 19:58:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @DeeDeeSchwartz3 @CNNnewsroom He was really on point today. They are finally starting to be much more direct about this Kremlin Coup. We have a very serious problem on our hands. The leaders in all three branches of our Gov are compromised.Thats why theyre all so bad/dishonest. Theyre world class Crooks.
937406936345128960 2017-12-03 19:43:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @dikell3 That is by far the best summary of this Kremlin coup, to date. Seth possesses the perfect combo of skills to bring this knowledge to terribly concerned Americans. The White House was stolen by Russian Mobsters. They must be removed ASAP. 
937378591045750785 2017-12-03 17:50:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @mkraju @harrisonmarkey Who knows, He might be in jail by then.
937378221661868034 2017-12-03 17:49:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @TXMarLo @JuddLegum This right here, this is what a f***ing Traitor/s look like. Biggest Con ever. I hope his base wakes up before he raises their taxes so he & his old rich cronies get a Big Beautiful Entitlement check. Mobsters! RESIST
937356730446569472 2017-12-03 16:23:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @EWErickson Like anybody with any true belief in God would trust what Fox News dude needs to say it! GROSS!
937355996145635328 2017-12-03 16:20:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @The_UnSilent_ @Mikel_Jollett I do love this pic. Back when we had a President who actually cared about people and had a little sense of humor.
937347676995293184 2017-12-03 15:47:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @XianJaneway @_belle_curve_ @laurelworlds Uh,uh, uh but you forgot the personal responsibility part 
937347087649464320 2017-12-03 15:45:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @Varidienne @matthewamiller Pretty sure nobody ever said lil elfin man was a smart cookie.
937344869974110208 2017-12-03 15:36:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @mkraju @harrisonmarkey We will be working very hard to get rid of Mitch in 2020. He must go and that could be the year.
937344672804065280 2017-12-03 15:35:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @mkraju @OwenMSchmidt No, thats how he always rolls. BELIEVE ME
937344274353573889 2017-12-03 15:34:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnJHarwood @mkraju Hes a big turtle turd, hes getting his tax cut for the rich so he doesnt give a crap about a child molester in Congress. Shameful.
937343018876784641 2017-12-03 15:29:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @kevin52850 @starshine731 I call them Russian Mobsters which I feel is more accurate. Its really all about the Russian Rubles for them. It has been for many years. Trump owes his whole success to them.

937339656034750464 2017-12-03 15:16:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @AntheaButler @jljacobson Yes I agree, they just used to try harder at pretending to believe it. They never really did but instead used it to keep there women and poor folk in line.

937307511417384960 2017-12-03 13:08:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger Your former party is a vast wasteland of compromised bigots. Its a great example of how depraved one can be when money and power are your drugs of choice. Repulsive.

937291553034391552 2017-12-03 12:04:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulsperry_ Yea, thats so far from what hes doing this tweet is a joke. Its not gonna help me, BELIEVE ME You Paul, are a total trump Shill.  We all know thisvTax Scam is a total gift to the the 1% and screws the middle class-SICK STUFF!
937290479896612864 2017-12-03 12:00:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulsperry_ I Think its time to update this Paul. How much time do you suppose trump will let his son/son in law do for him?
937192839661998081 2017-12-02 05:32:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @richardhine Treason.
937190518106271744 2017-12-02 05:23:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @pamboy712 Well perhaps the best of the low lives who will even consider working for him.
937189722543226881 2017-12-02 05:20:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Of course he lied. Dumb-dumb will probably tweet this fact tomorrow morning about 6:00 AM.
937187095713603585 2017-12-02 05:09:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @kristinegWP @JenniferJJacobs @szeer @BronckoBamma Bahaha more in line with trying to keep Flynn from flipping, that didnt go so well.
937186362314428416 2017-12-02 05:06:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @kristinegWP @JenniferJJacobs @BronckoBamma Bull, he would never have resigned. He was drunk on that power. He was fired because The gig was up and they made him the sacrificial lamb (first of many).
937185607218073600 2017-12-02 05:03:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @kristinegWP @JenniferJJacobs Yea, Im gonna have to call TOTAL BULLSHIT ON THAT. It was classic dumb-dumb.
937169768087523328 2017-12-02 04:00:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobinBrenizer Hang in there, recharge your batteries and come back when youve gained your footing and youre ready to resist again.
937158290127183873 2017-12-02 03:15:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @sharondigi @riotwomennn @bleachtheWH Sorry, I did but maybe Im just older than you. Ive been voting for 37 years and Ive never before respected a President like I respected BHO. He is in a class of his own. And look how far weve fallen :(
937156780261629952 2017-12-02 03:09:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @riotwomennn Yea, I did as I often do when Im reminded of what a smart, elegant and honest family they were. We were very lucky to have them for 8 years and I miss them terribly.
937153870043676673 2017-12-02 02:57:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @matthewamiller @ksqueed His tweets are considered official statements by the POTUS. Theyre screwed squeed, being a pathological liar is not a defense.
937153034152538113 2017-12-02 02:54:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @HERRINGBONE69 @kylegriffin1 @flybull1 She was right. Wake up and smell the coffee Mike. You backed a traitor to your country on day one. You might want to get your bullshit meter checked.
937152337931534342 2017-12-02 02:51:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @alexanderina That is now water under the bridge. Flynn new he was totally screwed and he went for the deal. Saved himself and his son, god knows trump Would have done the exact same thing if possible.
937151767158165505 2017-12-02 02:49:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @lovestdiomande Cant say I blame him & hell take his son & son in law with him.

937149643619741697 2017-12-02 02:41:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @SurrettLinda @TopherSpiro @loveisbrilliant Yea, any morsel of proof on Obama because theres a train load on trump! Trump and his treason train are so lawyered up theyre single handedly keeping the DC lawyers busy. But nice try at totally false equivalency.
937148031094358017 2017-12-02 02:34:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @GeorgeTorresNYC @TopherSpiro Drain the swamp my white skinny ass. These guys are bloody Mobsters. International money laundering Mobsters and I dont care if you like his racist views and he says it like you say it. Hes stealing from the poor and giving it to the rich. She was 100% correct. 
937133911489912832 2017-12-02 01:38:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald @4AnimalLife @USAMensaDropout @justatittle1 @sroth35 @dddduuuummmm Being Black is his fatal flaw for you haters. He was good for the Economy, healthcare, women, environment and our Country!s moral. He just wasnt good for racists in this country. Whats worse than a smart successful president. Never once had to hire a lawyer. Bahahaha.
937117417670692865 2017-12-02 00:32:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald @4AnimalLife @USAMensaDropout @justatittle1 @sroth35 You know, he was Black.

937112704527097857 2017-12-02 00:14:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti But dumb-dumb is like a smart person Renato. He has the best Ivy Keague degree Drump could buy.
937111692860895232 2017-12-02 00:10:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @Bonnieinchgo It seems a bit worse than his foot.
937101082744053760 2017-12-02 23:28:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mikel_Jollett Bahahaha no way! Theyre all him!!!
937094269046804481 2017-12-02 23:00:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @LunaLuvgood2017 Gave me a chuckle-thanks for that. Laughter is important at such scary times.
937077541315244033 2017-12-02 21:54:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC At the end of the day, Joe does pretty well on this tax deal. So much for concern over the debt though??? Joe believes in both sides
937076834310803457 2017-12-02 21:51:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @RosemaryMscott @catawu He is truly a puppet. His only real job is to distract with outrageous behavior. Tweeting stupid shit all the time. Cons are truly corporate crooks. They use racism to convince their voters theyre like minded & then screw them with a tax increase as a Thank you for their loyalty
937073692462518272 2017-12-02 21:39:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @lisamurkowski Shameful disregard for your voters in the interest of corporate money. I guess we all have our price, Id hoped you were better than that. Shameful Greed. GOP:GreedOverPeople
937064049908572161 2017-12-02 21:00:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @aravosis They just keep sharing both sides it gets worse every day.
937062052857896965 2017-12-02 20:52:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @OleHippieChick @buffaloon Look at the puffed up smug looks on their faces. Shameful how totally corrupt the Cons are now. There is truly nothing conservative about them. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  RESIST
937059835669082114 2017-12-02 20:44:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @SuzanneKelleher @cobystarr Dersh & trump go way back. They both have affinity for young girls. Sick.
937059330221838336 2017-12-02 20:42:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Dershowitz looked pretty nuts. When he started talking about Israel, it was really very revealing. You handled it beautifully. Thank you.
937053897537048577 2017-12-02 20:20:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @TruthOnly37 @soledadobrien Yes, hence forth it will be known as The Worlds Most Desperate Body.

Huge Thanks to the Smart Resisters, youve both helped illuminate the facts and contribute to provide Real News. Go Pros, No Cons.

937026149737254912 2017-12-02 18:30:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @DgzVivian @shannonrwatts Yes, it was but also epic fail on the part of the Dems for not getting word out. Today, we are Woke. Go Pros, No Cons RESIST

937022614735859712 2017-12-02 18:16:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @goldengateblond @SethAbramson Theyre going to need a much bigger graph to put Dotard Trump on there. 2018 cant come soon enough. 
937017121044918272 2017-12-02 17:54:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @joannegiovenco1 I certainly hope so, we may need their help.
937001861151895558 2017-12-02 16:53:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @joannegiovenco1 Yea does that somehow help? Russia? Russia is NOT on our side.

936999054470459392 2017-12-02 16:42:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @joannegiovenco1 No kidding, I live in Kentucky, its everywhere here.
936997601433571328 2017-12-02 16:36:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @joannegiovenco1 Hard to say who might instigate it at this point. If minorities continue to be discriminated against in every way, they could rise up (understandably) if trump out, the MAGAts could do it. Either way its dangerous for all.
936996401204158465 2017-12-02 16:32:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @GeriJoh @SenSchumer @TheWisemanSaid2 @alicenmary @DominickCannat1 Nice Dom, Im sure youre a great guy.

936995577119805440 2017-12-02 16:28:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @GeriJoh @SenSchumer @TheWisemanSaid2 @alicenmary Says the cat. Alice youre just wrong. Youll be paying more taxes before you know it and you still probably wont know it but you know MAGA!
936995265839591426 2017-12-02 16:27:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @Ricka168 @SenSchumer Kind of goes with this ridiculous excuse for a President though, Right?
936994759196971009 2017-12-02 16:25:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @joannegiovenco1 They really believe it too. The Cons have successfully weaponized a couple of Key Lies based on racist views to lead their cause. If the Dems dont get this turned around, it could end in civil unrest/war. Truly Scary Times.
936991568933937152 2017-12-02 16:12:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @joannegiovenco1 Id go with crazy, stupid and super hateful. Not a winning combo.
936989962662227968 2017-12-02 16:06:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @joannegiovenco1 Oh believe me, its been hell for me too. Each day is a slap in the face to see how truly despicable the Cons are. Im just trying to be hopeful that maybe the end result will expose them for the Fake News F***S that they are. So far, their lying has worked very well-SADLY!
936987788314075137 2017-12-02 15:57:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @joannegiovenco1 @bannerite No no way she would have but she probably wouldnt have been able to get anything positive passed either because of Con Obstructionism. That is one thing they are actually good at getting done.
936985166559444993 2017-12-02 15:47:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins NEWS FLASH.......They F-ing LIE.
936984968135356423 2017-12-02 15:46:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @SenatorCollins Just when it looked like you might be one of the few Cons with at least some integrity you voted for that tax scam? SHAMEFUL SENATOR, TRULY SHAMEFUL.
936983965407342592 2017-12-02 15:42:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman @bryanmsweeney Good, you should be. Its going to EPIC and very painful for the Cons. They will deserve each and every painful moment they receive. ENJOY!!! While you enjoy that, well be enjoying watching the Cons being prosecuted for their crimes. Payback a BITCH.
936974962740645888 2017-12-02 15:06:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @Smith83K @BruceBartlett Id go more with a pimp. Using a female for your analogy does normals sense as GOP has so few women. They pump out their base to pay higher taxes so they can pay their Donor Class back with huge tax cuts to the rich.
936972044180381696 2017-12-02 14:55:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @joannegiovenco1 How many independent committees do you suppose the Cons would have open on Hillary by now? Maybe this will all work to the Progressives advantage in the end? Had she won, the Cons would have cont to work their lies, hopefully daylight will expose their lying & cheating
936970836812189696 2017-12-02 14:50:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @KerryPicket @AuraCantor Has to go through House and then back to Senate-not really done YET!
936966715715543041 2017-12-02 14:34:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @WomanMDsGuide @JRubinBlogger As usual the deluded continue to delude.

936965497823916032 2017-12-02 14:29:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @0 @Twitter @JYSexton @TinaMorphis @trumpeffect Yes, we do every election. Not because we benefit but because its good for people and for our country. This was true even before they paired greed with so much hatred of others. This GOP is a new kind of evil in politics. RESIST.

936938504503906304 2017-12-02 12:42:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Ive been watching that, its completely biased just as their coverage of trump/Clinton. This both sides crap is crap. If theyre going to call it a win they need to state clearly exactly who is winning!
936937115765690369 2017-12-02 12:36:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @WeHearPodcast @VeeCee30 @williamlegate Lighten up William. Theyve passed a tax scam, Flynn flipped. Al pinching a couple of butts is hardly a distraction, if he even did it. I stand with The butt pincher over the P grabber any day. Wake up, this war & Franken is a Warrior, we need him.
936935217499181057 2017-12-02 12:28:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnJHarwood Sorry John, thats more like: Lies trump truth.

They believe Dirty Donnie when he says Im gonna pay more, beeliieeeve meeee. They screw the poorest the worst-that is So Sick! They are Mobsters.
936731989260021761 2017-12-01 23:01:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepMaxineWaters @walton_gm @DollMeUpbyDR Universal trumptell: does not know/no proper use of your/youre. 95% of the time True, but you also have an aversion to math/science/facts/education. HRC should have said Dumb Deplorables.
936667739011371009 2017-12-01 18:46:06 UTC <HenslerKate> I think many of us can use this, I know I sure can!!!
936665348245540864 2017-12-01 18:36:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepMaxineWaters @DollMeUpbyDR What part did I leave out?
936663935419330562 2017-12-01 18:30:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepMaxineWaters @DollMeUpbyDR Bahaha my intelligence level? Trump fired him only because it became public that he lied to Pence (Fake excuse) Pence knew all along. Trump used Flynn to connect with Russia. Crooked Cons are SCREWED Finally!!!
936663256017571841 2017-12-01 18:28:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @MattGertz @SethAMandel Seth, this repeated DUI douche deserves no respect. Also moving the embassy to Jerusalem would be a disaster. Sorry, but thats the truth.

936649270660386817 2017-12-01 17:32:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton Its so sick that theyre even considering passing that tax scam with the Flynn revelation . Is there nothing Dems can do to stop it? Cons are Cons and they will pay!
936618955833331712 2017-12-01 15:32:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Had not has, tweeting while exercising leads to typos
936615506223816704 2017-12-01 15:18:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Hell yes of course he did. They were totally cool with conspiring against the United States with POS Putin. The worst part, its all about the damn money.
936615074407550976 2017-12-01 15:16:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Bring it on. If he does, and he probably will bc hes off his Nut, the Resistance has better be ready to shut this shit show down!

936576175954067457 2017-12-01 12:42:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @marthamaccallum @LindseyGrahamSC Talk about talking out both sides of your mouth. I used to think you had at least some integrity., clearly, I was wrong. Sure hope the real people in SC use Tax Scam anger to I unseat you. Its past time!

936569848049668097 2017-12-01 12:17:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @esthersandra Im still a Dem but I agree that we need more backbone. If an enemy of the state in the Oval Office isnt enough to shock them into action then what the heck would be? Dems stand up and lead against this traitor and his band of thieves NOW!!!
936458211217084416 2017-11-30 04:53:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @micy44 @AJDelgado13 @daleethompson Bahaha havent heard bumped uglies before. Yea Id heard he knocked someone up, too bad for her and of course Jasons wife! Hes not exactly the sharpest tool in the box.

936390749960237056 2017-11-30 00:25:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @micy44 @AJDelgado13 Hes so gross. Please tell me you didnt have an affair with that meat head.
936387010180284417 2017-11-30 00:10:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lee_in_Iowa @NancyPelosi Well Rep Pelosi, there is one good reason (if youre a Con). If you embrace trickle down economics you get to cut the taxes of the 1% (the Uber Rich) so that your donors will continue to give you tuns of money. $$
936381298846859267 2017-11-30 23:47:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @RKJ65 Well done.
936376234388410368 2017-11-30 23:27:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @AynRandPaulRyan Wow, hate crime promotion comes to Walmart. Wonder if theyll be hocking Muslim round up nets for the Holidays?
936352831665303552 2017-11-30 21:54:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenJohnMcCain @BryanDawsonUSA @Marmel @MaryAbrahams @Archivist1000 His wife is from big money.
936309539087048704 2017-11-30 19:02:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lee_in_Iowa New to tobreally hard work out class today. It was challenging but rewarding. Thanks for asking.
936304807358423045 2017-11-30 18:43:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @trytostopJane Completely Shameful.
936302349261385728 2017-11-30 18:34:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnJHarwood This is Cultural Rape.
936288298837970945 2017-11-30 17:38:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenJohnMcCain @SethHanlon @zeldagatsby Regular order seems to have taken on new meaning.
936286653299286017 2017-11-30 17:31:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kris_Sacrebleu His speech is very disjointed. This makes it totally clear, you can see his dull lightbulb go off when he says rocket fuel
936285432811347969 2017-11-30 17:26:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @BloombergTV @VonnieQuinn @RepJohnYarmuth Shut it down, make the scoundrels pay for their dishonesty.

936277265440301057 2017-11-30 16:54:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuddLegum Omg look what weve become. Maybe Dirty Donnie can send in his buds from Charlottesville to take them out.
936274590170583041 2017-11-30 16:43:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @jacksnowknows Lets hope its the big kahuna and it takes him to his final resting place. Buried under the head table at Mar-A-Lago.

936270291793334273 2017-11-30 16:26:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @overthewall1630 @ColsBols Its so disappointing.
936270149816119296 2017-11-30 16:26:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @laureldavilacpa @CJPatruno Exactly the same for me. I wanted HRC to win but seeing Dirty Donnie win has really made me question our government. I see clearly now what we are up against. RESIST LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT, BECAUSE IT DOES.
936268399549865984 2017-11-30 16:19:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonahfreedman @thebiologistisn @AllBungled @JoeParrino4 Your grammar sucks, are you Russian?
936266945237798912 2017-11-30 16:13:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonahfreedman Needless to say shes 100% Correct. The only question is what the hell are we going to do about it. Its time the Resistance move on DC. They cant pass Tax Scam if they cant get to Congress.
936265823869599744 2017-11-30 16:09:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @SamCoatesTimes Its a trifecta! Hes all three!
936228976401567745 2017-11-30 13:42:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @justmeinlv Please dont let this make you sad. It should make you mad as hell and ready to not take it any more.Lets get to DC and then demand that Congress stop the lunacy with terrible judges, cab members, and tax scam. Its up to us or we are screwed. RESIST or pay the piper. Choose One
936226204734062593 2017-11-30 13:31:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kanew Go Dana Do you have a share blue account? After whatvtge awful Republican male politicians have done in MI, more women makes perfect sense. Drain that crooked male swamp!
936223367421669376 2017-11-30 13:20:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @JW4Resistance @JJohnsonLaw #NotMyPresident either. I would never vote for such a despicable person, not even for dog catcher catcher. I reject everything about him. Dirty Donnie belongs in prison. #RESIST

936121830447906817 2017-11-29 06:36:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @DeeDeeSchwartz3 Distinction without a difference. If youre being murdered, you are dying. Of course its being murdered and as a result, its dying.
936096871797403648 2017-11-29 04:57:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @DeeDeeSchwartz3 I totally agree. Aside from being completely selfish and self-centered., They want to eliminate any  entitlement programs and those who suffer can turn on each other.  Then theyll declare Marshal Law and take title power. Vilify all groups that oppose them. Democracy is dying.
936094941733965826 2017-11-29 04:50:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @MsAnneBoleyn Shell probably recommend a firing squad.
936092131927654400 2017-11-29 04:38:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @EdanClay @tenax666 Then lets change the damn script. Lets be the heros. Its time to move on Washington.

936054603875045377 2017-11-29 02:09:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @sahilkapur @NilaMoz Hes worth 30 million so its prob not about $$$, its about POWER.
936045829512749056 2017-11-29 01:34:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepMoBrooks God youre so GROSS! Backing Roy Moore-youre as slimy as he is. The yearbook most certainly has not been proven to be fake-thats crap!!!
936038904251240449 2017-11-29 01:07:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @theresamay @realDonaldTrump @stopthenutjob Yes when? This is getting so far out of control its time for the Resistance to move on DC before they pass the Tax Scam and he gets us into a war.
936021379421560832 2017-11-29 23:57:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @AngelinaSnow007 @tonyposnanski Oh for sure, if ever a total sleaze ball, Its Geraldo.

He was making 25M a year??? Hes not very handsome (to me) and just ok as host (to me) I guess I just always got a really cocky fibe from him. Not my cup of tea. Maybe his replacement will be hot?
935985391047454721 2017-11-29 21:34:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein @janeeucraft Pass a tax plan that screws low/middle income, promote Moore as best option and ignore trumps increasingly deranged tweets/actions. Install extremist life time judges. If this isnt a constitutional crisis, what is? Im more than ready, come on women its our kids who go to war!

Oh and hell take away health insurance from millions. But undeveloped cells trump that? Why?
935973199816417280 2017-11-29 20:46:15 UTC <HenslerKate> God I pray they do. Youre a very sick hater Roy! Lose, lose, lose!!!
935967495546077186 2017-11-29 20:23:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @KassandraSeven Cool maybe his cell mate can be his running mate! WTAF?
935963971768717312 2017-11-29 20:09:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezraklein All for a MAGA Tax Cut to the MEGA Rich? That is SICK!!!
935962748973920262 2017-11-29 20:04:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @KentuckyBaptist You folks are Religious extremists who encourage abuse towards women and diminishing the rights of women. This is not Christian. Have that Gospel Conversation for a change.
935961577672577024 2017-11-29 20:00:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @OleHippieChick @riotwomennn Yes they need to call it DOA. They do not deserve that much respect. They have treated the real press like crap since the day he kicked off his campaign.
935955655541829632 2017-11-29 19:36:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @lizfinger1 @timjacobwise I tried to be more generous initially but it has now become crystal clear that that is exactly what this is. Its so deeply disturbing to me.
935949546932310018 2017-11-29 19:12:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @josephamodeo Problem with this is that trump is not opposed to racism and hatred. Exactly the opposite is true.
935946581370654720 2017-11-29 19:00:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @PressSec You Sarah, are a special kind of Evil!
935945019554435072 2017-11-29 18:54:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @pblest Good Lord, thats repulsive.
935944548991283200 2017-11-29 18:52:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @NavKaz @hphannguyen Screwing the middle class is as Republican as you can get. I think its time for you to embrace your inner Democrat.
935935577408593921 2017-11-29 18:16:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @theamazingMrS @tweetygirl53 @bonniemurphy Omg you think sports figure should be role models but not POTUS? Please listen to what you just said. That is not rational thinking.
935935076088545282 2017-11-29 18:14:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @theamazingMrS @bonniemurphy MAGA for everyone. Its official, way too much of the poison kook-aid BoomBoom.
935934737310470145 2017-11-29 18:13:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @theamazingMrS @bonniemurphy You may need to re-evaluate the Cult thing, saying you jumped on the trump train is a huge red flag. Also we didnt need a racist, homophobic, misogynist, islamophobe hater. Its been a total shit show!
935933219043758085 2017-11-29 18:07:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @bonniemurphy Bullcrap.
935889156236029952 2017-11-29 15:12:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @ClaraJeffery @natsecHeather Silly? Wow that would probably be my last choice of words to describe these tweets.
935876894737817600 2017-11-29 14:23:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @NavKaz @pbump Uhhhh think you forgot delusion and pure evil.
935874649816289280 2017-11-29 14:14:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @kevin52850 @Tonypapa9 Dirty Donnie perfect name for him.
935858876955709440 2017-11-29 13:11:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @imillhiser No Shit, this couldnt happen to a more deserving guy!
935858014761996288 2017-11-29 13:08:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @ClaraJeffery Really, she was good too!
935857436417765378 2017-11-29 13:06:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC Is he so f ing tone deaf that he doesnt know what this says about him? Obviously he is.
935855141802201088 2017-11-29 12:57:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarlaMHughes @marcorubio Screw You Marco, I mean little Marco! You know what this madman is and you stand idly by and watch him steal from the poor to give to the rich and march this Country off to war. So SCREW YOU!
935751385911611393 2017-11-28 06:04:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @JillWineBanks @joanwalsh 100000000000%
935502343000469504 2017-11-28 13:35:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @DeeLovelyone79 Sorry always preferred World Book!
935502055376064512 2017-11-28 13:34:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @mrsWaif Bahaha or you finally find the darn periodical and some jerk has ripped out the article youre looking for.
935500729485332482 2017-11-28 13:28:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Nope, youre wrong. Officially they really all say the same thing in a variety of different ways. Responding just gives them credibility and helps to distract from the real crap that theyre sneaking in the back door.
935499356010139649 2017-11-28 13:23:21 UTC <HenslerKate> Wtf, this is so 1950 its painful.
935497281473835009 2017-11-28 13:15:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @Green_Footballs Me too Charles, its so wrong on so many levels and its so pervasive.
935496173317754880 2017-11-28 13:10:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @Elise_Jordan Just Saw that you worked for Rand Paul. So now its all making sense. Now the idiotic things you consistently say make a lot more sense! No more responses to you warranted! You crazy Libertarians need to go off on an island somewhere and take each other out! PLEASE.
935495062787674112 2017-11-28 13:06:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Elise_Jordan Blah, blah, blah Dems missed opportunity to what? Pay the price for trump and Moores sexual molestation of many women/GIRLS. Right after they take responsibility, we will. Life long Dem here, shut your yap. As a Con, youd do better speaking to their many ISSUES.
935489579439751168 2017-11-28 12:44:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytpolitics @DaleHudspeth Well well well Whatabout...the Clintons??? Bahaha trump commits treason and youre still talking about the losing candidate? Sad Dale, very sad. Wake up and take a whiff of your crap coffee.
935487719635111936 2017-11-28 12:37:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnJHarwood @nytpolitics @FrankLasCPA Enjoy your delusions soon reality will be slapping you in the face at which time youll Decide that Treason is better than Democrats. Hopeless case.
935486857315606529 2017-11-28 12:33:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytpolitics @judyjones232 Denial aint just a river. Come up from Fake News world and see the light!
935477241332543488 2017-11-28 11:55:29 UTC <HenslerKate> Wake the F up, it was NOT a one day phenomenon. Just when you appear to be beginning to get it you say something idiotic like that.
935476661113577472 2017-11-28 11:53:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 God the Cons SUCK!
935471535095197696 2017-11-28 11:32:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @thomas_moffett @SkwirlyQ You only source Fake News Sourced Q, site a real one or be ignored.
935469204047884288 2017-11-28 11:23:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @BobCorker Senator, please dont succumb to pressure on the tax scam. Screwing small businesses, increasing taxes on many middle/poor and blowing up the debt is a really crappy legacy. Please do the right thing, China is going to own us & worse, our grandchildren :(
935467990405079040 2017-11-28 11:18:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @BobCorker @IvankaTrump Guess we know this did not go as hoped!
935324991368900608 2017-11-27 01:50:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @CarlosM61269234 @JoeBarri Resistance is new to me since the womens march but Ive been thinking this for months. They rely on the Lefts passivity and Im just not all that passive about this. If we want our Democracy were going to have to take it back from these Mobsters.
935321809997762564 2017-11-27 01:37:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedTRaccoon My kind of women!
935318678102511616 2017-11-27 01:25:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @rmecheeya @krassenstein He doesnt even represent USA.

935296902266048517 2017-11-27 23:58:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @Brookssista1 Not nearly as much as we pay for his perpetual golf trips.
935280064593317888 2017-11-27 22:51:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @thomas_moffett @SkwirlyQ Sorry flipping Fox Faux News is not a credible source.
935279782161502209 2017-11-27 22:50:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @thomas_moffett @DavidPerlman @SkwirlyQ @luckybleu Yep southerners like um young and dumb. All the better to seduce and molest.
935279321484333058 2017-11-27 22:49:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @thomas_moffett @DavidPerlman @SkwirlyQ Weeeeaaaaskkkkk!
935279184317960193 2017-11-27 22:48:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @thomas_moffett @SkwirlyQ Not debunked. Youre the one not paying attention also watched him closely at HS ball games to keep him away from cheerleaders. Get a grip Alabama. Christians should not support pedophiles.
935276973601017858 2017-11-27 22:39:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @waterfairy3 Yea because he occasionally tells the truth. Guess you like trump? Donna, please wake Up.
935276344858107904 2017-11-27 22:37:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump No Fox??? Bahahaha deal breaker, they are hands down the worst. Theyre entertainment and not news because theyre so bad.
935274597578084352 2017-11-27 22:30:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @DianeKovacs Very true.
935273220168650753 2017-11-27 22:24:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @Elise_Jordan @MFisher1274 Hell no, hes instead quite proud.
935272772011528192 2017-11-27 22:23:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @Elise_Jordan Please Elise, photographic evidence of what? A professional comedian making a slightly crass joke? Unbelievable that you expect Dems to kick a great Senator out of Congress and your illegitimate party elected a serial sexual predator as POTUS. Geeet Reeaal
935271566694330368 2017-11-27 22:18:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @KaivanShroff @KwingetWilliams I wish he was my Senator instead I have mean old Mitch McConnell. Id take Al 100 times if it meant getting rid of Mitch just once!
935270269240991744 2017-11-27 22:13:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @Russian_Starr I am not convinced that votes werent changed plus hacking, Fake News via social media, wikileaks and Comey. White haters voted for him for sure but Im not sure they didnt get a whole lot of help.
935268095094067201 2017-11-27 22:04:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @stevesilberman @Brian_Hjelle Didnt know that and it already seemed really, really bad.
935267486563487744 2017-11-27 22:01:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @stevesilberman @vmack1958 @Steel_Donkey Wish the people from the CBC had done it to trump and KA.
935266592337915904 2017-11-27 21:58:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @alaskarebel @stevesilberman I dont know, as awful as it was, its up against very stiff competition. Encouraged cops to be more violent with suspects? Telling Boy Scouts about some gross guy in NYC & bad mouthing Obama to them? How he treated the Americans in PR, throwing PT at them. Both sides Crap?
935263977986314240 2017-11-27 21:48:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @NicolleDWallace @MyraDSirois1 @cupcaking3 Today and every day. What a total debacle.
935260996708589568 2017-11-27 21:36:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 @RichieRichNYC17 Lots of educated white people support him too (much as I hate to admit it)
935260264626360321 2017-11-27 21:33:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 Bull Daniel, his White supporters like it.  Dont kid yourself. Thats exactly what they mean when they say, he says it like I say it
935258860893372418 2017-11-27 21:27:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @GiGicmka @TeaPainUSA @carrieluckas Ive been ready for months. Its past time. Lets do this folks!
935124208937586688 2017-11-27 12:32:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddiamond @tedlieu Yes Congressman, I know you took crap for not observing the moment of silence. I completely agreed with you rejecting it. A moment of silence while making it easier & easier for people to get guns is a slap in the victims face.
935021624755138561 2017-11-26 05:45:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti @Boomingbox I dont need to know you, your bias is quite obvious and self-serving. Help all the kids you want to but stay the hell away from a womans right to choose. You and yours can live by your dogma, what gives you the right to dictate it to others?
935003013495820288 2017-11-26 04:31:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @suevisa @RWPUSA Agreed.
934993055580590080 2017-11-26 03:51:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias No what is Yes Minister?
934987091599089664 2017-11-26 03:27:48 UTC <HenslerKate> Terribly sad and wrong and scary and hateful and racist and misogynistic and bigoted. Not unlike so many other moments weve all experienced in the last year. Its been a long series of really horrible moments aka a damn nightmare.
934985260282105856 2017-11-26 03:20:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Blocked him awhile ago, still hear about his worst ones.
934984359031033856 2017-11-26 03:16:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Ive been doing it for awhile, so sure, count me in.
934982951623974913 2017-11-26 03:11:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti @Boomingbox Hundreds of thousands?Please, do you also listen to the many more who say it was a difficult decision but was also the best decision at the time? No, they dont count to you Christian Extremists. Youre happy to cut them off the minute theyre born. Personal Responsibility& all
934979912817152000 2017-11-26 02:59:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @Sandy81798642 @kylegriffin1 OMG WTAF?
934979482485690368 2017-11-26 02:57:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti @Boomingbox Damaged for life? Says who, you? Seems you were born that way.
934978704102567936 2017-11-26 02:54:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti @FraserMacLeod5 You forgot malignant.
934978065096114176 2017-11-26 02:51:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @THP1640 @renato_mariotti There is seriously no limit to how bloody low these Cons will go.

934946461208449025 2017-11-26 00:46:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @MarionBurr5 @ColMorrisDavis Bahahaha even though your tweet closely resembles his actual damaged mind script, you somehow managed to make it funny. Well Done.
934944776260063232 2017-11-26 00:39:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @katezdorf Me too.
934943537220734976 2017-11-26 00:34:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @Indyvoter707 @sweetcher62 Its called a very easy mark. Cons are completely selfish people.
934942480189018112 2017-11-26 00:30:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @boru2308 @PreetBharara Bahaha good one.

934935879134654465 2017-11-26 00:04:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @carpediem1969UI @tonyschwartz If hes being worshipped hes happy. For him, it doesnt matter who worships him as long as they do. Twisted.
934921567217291264 2017-11-26 23:07:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @FBI @tedlieu @MaryAbrahams @roxannelwright Mitch is my Senator and I am going to remind myself of that fact as I work tirelessly to ditch his crooked a**. He cares nothing for his constituents only his donors. Dont forget Merrick Garland whose seat he gave to self-righteous extremist gorsuch. 2020 hes toast!
934912183145762816 2017-11-26 22:30:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JohnnyInOakland @TimnGibsons @duckshawkey @amoreimarketing @hoverman @radioedyeary Sure or I dont know, like the only real news people on Faux News. Fox and the like have truly poisoned your brain. Its very scary. Archie Bunker Fox News has created millions of Archie Bunkers. Cons are going to pay dearly in up coming elections. Hopefully it wont be too late.
934910613993779201 2017-11-26 22:23:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahsMimi @DAvallone Yes, being morally reprehensible is really quite simple isnt it. Shining light on it doesnt make it understandable or somehow more acceptable. They dont deserve the reasoned focus, they deserve to be monitored & arrested when warranted.
934908573603287043 2017-11-26 22:15:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill Proving once again that trump manages to be his own biggest champion and his own worst enemy at the same time. He is so exhausting. He is a World Class Conman, Ive got to give him that.
934906951913361409 2017-11-26 22:09:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JohnnyInOakland @TimnGibsons @duckshawkey @amoreimarketing @hoverman @radioedyeary Oh like on the rare occasion that Wallace or Sheppard Smith actually asks a real question or makes an honest comment regarding the trump regime?
934904455581110274 2017-11-26 21:59:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @PreetBharara @ReluctantRangr @eskolaaksonen Oh boy, Ron Paul was another Russian puppet, youre wrong about him.
934904063786995712 2017-11-26 21:57:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bobbiea0610 @PreetBharara Very well said. Im enjoying your podcast, thanks for being a guiding light. You are needed and appreciated. Sir.
934903470364164097 2017-11-26 21:55:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @exoticgamora @LawyerRogelio Wow, awesome tweet, awesome response. Good job!

934897313570533377 2017-11-26 21:31:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @IronStache @starbuck13502 Ryan is a really heartless fake Catholic Prosperity Christian. He cares only about GOP big donors. Hes deplorable.
934894115640238085 2017-11-26 21:18:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianschatz @JAshworthUTS Public infrastructure seems at first a bit hyperbolic but it is in fact accurate. It has to be full access by definition. I Hate to see it happen. Cons like pricing people out of things. Its wrong.
934865995885314051 2017-11-26 19:26:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT @ProvaxShill Im sure youre correct about that.
934865063424462850 2017-11-26 19:22:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @guypbenson @jeffcieslak No Way Dems would have ever elected an immoral idiot like trump.
934859571507744768 2017-11-26 19:01:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Interesting how they changed the title.

934856190592540673 2017-11-26 18:47:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @DebraMessing @pokemyeyesout @IamTylerLaken Oh wow big burn Tyler, was that one via Info Wars? Or did you get that from Donnies new fav megapill? Funny, this has come full circle. You, ultimately, proving our exact point.
934854872683438080 2017-11-26 18:42:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @DebraMessing @pokemyeyesout @IamTylerLaken Weak.
934854694891065346 2017-11-26 18:41:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @DebraMessing @pokemyeyesout @IamTylerLaken Yea, youre wrong on that. They did discuss before the hate rally that using a car to injure/kill others was a viable option. They also came heavily armed, in case you missed that as well.
934854020178554880 2017-11-26 18:39:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @DebraMessing @pokemyeyesout @IamTylerLaken Ps Im sure youll deny it, but Ill match my education against yours, any day of the week. You might want to start with differentiating proper use of your from youre.
934853289207791616 2017-11-26 18:36:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @DebraMessing @pokemyeyesout @IamTylerLaken Sure Tyler, why do you (in your infinite wisdom) think that the Birther in Chief got elected?
934852324782112770 2017-11-26 18:32:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @DebraMessing @pokemyeyesout @IamTylerLaken Well thats bull, hes president because the Southern Strategy has worked, Faux News, Breitbart... has worked. In a nutshell, hes president because there are still a lot of racists in this Country. Trump used it and it worked.
934850421604089857 2017-11-26 18:24:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @DebraMessing @pokemyeyesout @IamTylerLaken I had no problem with friends who were Republicans but trump support is a horse of a different color. Just their support of science denial is a deal breaker. Only in current trump false reality is it ok to pick and choose facts. Facts are facts Tyler, not negotiable.
934849009860186112 2017-11-26 18:19:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @NancyPelosi @hughhewitt @MeetThePress And this is somehow different from your ridiculous defense of trump and his many sexual assaults? Youre gross!
934848622763675648 2017-11-26 18:17:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @hughhewitt Embarrassed for you, trying to make totally false distinction between Moore and Trump accusers. Please, thats just blatant crap Hugh.
934847919177584640 2017-11-26 18:14:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol @cirizarryster High is so full of crap. Da, moore obviously guilty, trump well thats different, I voted for him
934847380645695490 2017-11-26 18:12:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol @BifferNelson @alanhkaiser I dont agree but I do like spit the bit.
934847129322967040 2017-11-26 18:11:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarlaMHughes @BillKristol Ummm, these two are far from equivalent Bill.  Both wrong (agreed) but far from equal.
934845904724611073 2017-11-26 18:06:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @DebraMessing @pokemyeyesout @IamTylerLaken What you call shitty friend I call principled person. Ill take a Jenny as a friend any day if the week, you Tyler, no thanks.
934845317576581121 2017-11-26 18:04:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @DebraMessing @pokemyeyesout Helped to put coal sludge in Kentuckys rivers and streams. Also allowing for previously banned pesticides to be used on vegetables. FYI: this also affects you and yours.
934844204685119490 2017-11-26 18:00:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @SusanSarandon This is bull, thanks to your help we are stuck with this horrible president. Many of our Reps are with him because all they care about is $$$.
934843710952665088 2017-11-26 17:58:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @JilSanderPR @SusanSarandon Any respect I had for you is 100% gone. You are irrational and helped to defeat HRC who would have been 95% better than dumb-dumb. ThAnks for nothing!
934840686708391942 2017-11-26 17:46:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @donnabrazile @johnwademcalist God youre a nut job. Hows Alex Jones?
934762741583237120 2017-11-26 12:36:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @CuriousGreg As a Kentuckian, Im right there with you on @SenateMajLdr
934627868155568130 2017-11-25 03:40:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @davidcmoffat Convince trump of what. Hes been spending their money for years. Hes a crook and a conman. Hes a Mobster.
934627413136429056 2017-11-25 03:38:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @IAmReidiculous Of course hes right. Biggest story ever.
934621804395749377 2017-11-25 03:16:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnJHarwood @kylegriffin1 Wtf?, is this a joke?

934521939846205440 2017-11-25 20:39:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnDingell Painful.

934512869886046208 2017-11-25 20:03:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @jmartNYT @alexburnsNYT @maggieNYT Maggie, you do a whole bunch of stating the obvious.
934502858019524610 2017-11-25 19:23:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnWDean Per usual, this decision will come from the bottom up and it does not lead to Bernie.
934488365717528576 2017-11-25 18:26:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @TruckerBobS Crazy Conspiracy Crap.
934481522433896448 2017-11-25 17:58:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @DearAuntCrabby @ksqueed I live in Kentucky so I certainly do, this pic is not a stretch for plenty of men here!
934472735690055682 2017-11-25 17:23:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @AlexWitt @JillWineBanks Sting like a bee 
934441631931158528 2017-11-25 15:20:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @g1gary @davidaxelrod Its really very scary to see the profound damage they are doing while the Crooked Cons in Congress watch it all happen as they salivate for tax cuts for the Uber rich.
934439854800240640 2017-11-25 15:13:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyGervasi @Warchildsghost Oh God me either, no way!
934405755742179328 2017-11-25 12:57:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @newtgingrich You are so gross. Carnival barker #2. Rational Americans know that a load of crap. Bring on the indictments, the trump klan will do hard time. ENJOY!!!
934233339602628609 2017-11-24 01:32:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @robins_roost @BillKristol Youre progressing.
934147052656910336 2017-11-24 19:49:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnCornyn @tedcruz @txmockingjay Texas rivals Kentucky in the bad Senator department.
934143708282474496 2017-11-24 19:36:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnCornyn @tedcruz @txmockingjay Sorry theyre terrible. Senator McConnells local office does answer not that he actually cares what real people say. They only listen to the Donor Class.
934130663535661056 2017-11-24 18:44:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnCornyn @tedcruz @txmockingjay Call their local offices, theyll probably answer.

934072990505013249 2017-11-24 14:55:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump We see you Autocrats. We want our country back.
934071530266513409 2017-11-24 14:49:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnOSullivan36 @johnpavlovitz To continue to hope for the best is to be the climate deniers progressive counterpart. Facts are facts. We see what we see. #RESIST
934058775237013504 2017-11-24 13:59:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein Fascists dont like the 1st amendment. They want people to stick to their script. It does not work like that. Move to Mother Russia if you want a damn dictator.
934039805947731968 2017-11-24 12:43:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT Maggie, Ive been reading some pretty bad stuff about you/trump/Russia. It appears to be true. Get on the right side of history and stop pretending to be in the middle. Theres no middle here.
933838945057681408 2017-11-23 23:25:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @no2l @krassenstein He would have already been impeached months ago.

933804386056392705 2017-11-23 21:08:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @RadioFreeTom @jonrog1 @JamesSkeldon Well back to thats just dumb. I get this is trumps MO, I didnt commit treason, you did. But these Cons are fascists James, not the Dems.
933741470296702977 2017-11-23 16:58:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @amandablount2 Using God To rationalize abuse of woman/girls makes it even worse and even more damaging in the long run. They subjugate their females for life.
933740179168350208 2017-11-23 16:53:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @RadioFreeTom @jonrog1 @JamesSkeldon Democrats are communists? More like White Right Wing Evangelical Religious Extremists are White Supremacists who support Racism and Fascism, God and guns over peoples rights. UnAmerican at its core.
933701977485332481 2017-11-23 14:21:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @RadioFreeTom @jonrog1 @JamesSkeldon Well now thats just dumb.

933447116873138176 2017-11-22 21:28:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnCornyn Senator some regulations are clearly needed. Net Neutrality is widely supported. How much are the Cons planning on making off of this one. Youll be sorry.
933388375578632192 2017-11-22 17:35:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepSwalwell Thankful for your leadership as well. Youve been a beacon of hope and light. Stand strong for the Resistance Congressman.
933306527561211904 2017-11-22 12:09:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Youre a white poor mans version of Don King, with the hair.
933306131258265600 2017-11-22 12:08:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle No, he means White Religious Extremists, the Base. You support someone who committed crimes against the United States of America. Right so far? Tell that to the judge, IngrahamAnger.

933303199087431680 2017-11-22 11:56:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ShafPatel @XNVGX Speaking of learning from mistakes, When you mean you are its youre not your. Did all of you trumpers drop out of school in 5th grade?
933302467663679488 2017-11-22 11:53:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You are killing their league, Dotard. You, are you proud of yourself. You need to take an ass. That shouldnt be hard for you.
933148818614509568 2017-11-21 01:43:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @bettyhalford Thats revolting.

932983151814684677 2017-11-21 14:44:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @axios Rex is a crook. I dont care what company he ran, he wreaks of dishonesty.
932982860524466177 2017-11-21 14:43:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost Well of course he did, 100%. Hes a despicable person.

932482381298176010 2017-11-19 05:34:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @AdamSchiffCA Though I agree with you, trump is incapable of understanding why what you say is true.
932481426171355136 2017-11-19 05:31:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @SCMilitarybrat @tonyschwartz Yea, not so sure old Sarah has a heart Tony. The ease with which she lies would point to no.
932480984792162304 2017-11-19 05:29:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobertWeinber16 Well thank you Robert.
932480492452098048 2017-11-19 05:27:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Yes, it would be terrible if they passed tax scam to screw the poor and middle  class folks. Rich people obviously dont need help!
932477347093196800 2017-11-19 05:14:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobertWeinber16 I like the way you think Robert.

932442164923129857 2017-11-19 02:55:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @owillis Its so completely disgusting. And folks just seem to pretend that they dont know what it is.

932372169002291200 2017-11-19 22:17:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @CarlosM61269234 @RadioFreeTom Yes, where the hell are the patriotic Constitutionalists when you need them? The only remaining piece of Constitutionalist & Conservative sadly is Con.
932356508511342593 2017-11-19 21:14:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @letahamilton383 @RWPUSA Almost like its a conspiracy, again.
932356185315074049 2017-11-19 21:13:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @Comey The smile this brings is appreciated.
932353813536788480 2017-11-19 21:04:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @lskurrus @TheRickyDavila Yes, its so blatant any more. Hope Kush enjoys testifying in front of Congress-AGAIN. Im guessing hes coming down with a profound case of the I dont recalls. Maybe he can go before the Federalists and tell some jokes about it.
932351466634993666 2017-11-19 20:54:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @letahamilton383 @LeahDaughtry So true. No wonder we still mourn but by god were not giving up to these crooks.
932350816106811393 2017-11-19 20:52:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein Like taking candy from a damn baby.

932340715933327360 2017-11-19 20:12:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Omg, please tell me this is a joke.
932339864233705472 2017-11-19 20:08:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @juliettewithher Yay For Virginia Dems-Yall rocked it!!!

931962937555804162 2017-11-18 19:10:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @rieth_damon @teilashae Thanks for representing. Alabama needs some new blood. #NoMoreMoore #RESIST
931892238195613696 2017-11-18 14:29:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @Atticus59914029 @carrieabigstick Wow that sounds pretty bad, would not have expected that.
931850946640048129 2017-11-18 11:45:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorBrakey @DrRandPaul Senator, surely youre not going to vote for the tax scam? As a deficit hawk, you cant be ok with 2.2 Trillion $$$ added to the debt. Stick to your word Rand!
931597971149467649 2017-11-17 19:00:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @marchinstlouis @ksqueed No, Im not missing it, I just dont agree 100% and you aggressively attacking those who dont agree with you does not help our cause either. The fact that she was on Hannity and allegedly knew pic was being taken is relevant and the slut pic was obviously public.
931593182722347008 2017-11-17 18:41:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @marchinstlouis @ksqueed Also, FYI, she has been on the Hannity show so.....
931592950643032064 2017-11-17 18:40:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @marchinstlouis @ksqueed Boudoir picture?, Sure.
931591594343587840 2017-11-17 18:35:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @marchinstlouis @ksqueed Also, FYI, the person (allegedly) who took the pic withFranken said she was pretending to be dead & very aware of the picture being taken. So maybe lighten up a little?
931569911503171584 2017-11-17 17:09:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @jemelehill Pretty sure hes a Bot.
931569321536557057 2017-11-17 17:06:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @brithume This is one of the dumbest things Ive heard in awhile.
931566675488595969 2017-11-17 16:56:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Gee Agsin, Ole Rog must be some kind of prophet.
931553109347852293 2017-11-17 16:02:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABCPolitics @JRubinBlogger CRICKETS. Oh yea, he used to be poor 
931552389248815105 2017-11-17 15:59:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @TrumpResign @idaho_resister Oh no, youre not alone. Ive been pretty much in a state of either shock or rage for a year now. I Dont expect it to get better until 2018 landslide happens and impeach his Treasonous ass & dump his conspirators in Congress.
931551347761172480 2017-11-17 15:55:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @TrumpResign @idaho_resister Many of us feel the same way Courtney. Things are changing for the worse exponentially on a daily basis. Sometimes a breakdown is in order.
931550122223206401 2017-11-17 15:50:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @My2Sintz @meraheard The dude is twisted, come on, isnt that obvious.
931549797122576385 2017-11-17 15:49:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @DelayKathleen @marchinstlouis The picture is bad but her association with a Hannity, deal breaker for me. Also Stones awareness of breaking story.
931546938935267328 2017-11-17 15:37:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @NavKaz @Ladisaintsfan Daaa support most everything you do your words, not mine. I forgot, you base folks dont go for rational thought.
931545017788850176 2017-11-17 15:30:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @NavKaz @Ladisaintsfan So youre ok with his abuse of women, poor people, people of color & Muslims, its only the elephants you care about? Isnt that interesting?
931543772646821888 2017-11-17 15:25:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC @bigdaisyjam I disagree hes a hell of a lot worse than a ninny.
931543521064046593 2017-11-17 15:24:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC I dont call him Dumb-Dumb for nothing.
931542700033282049 2017-11-17 15:21:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @soledadobrien Barf.
931541417922613248 2017-11-17 15:15:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @Resistance_Rach It may be calculated but not well calculated. Look at how much heat hes getting because hes going after Franken & silent Moore. Dumb move.
931539717845372928 2017-11-17 15:09:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @WomanMDsGuide @jessiesingernyc Sure didnt take long either did it?
931538011929628674 2017-11-17 15:02:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @rosato1030 @DearAuntCrabby If so, I vow to be there for the perp walk! And then Im going to go to Saks and buy something very nice in his honor.
931535704441663489 2017-11-17 14:53:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @Resistance_Rach Hes gotten away with his lies and crap for so long hes completely clueless.
931534949961920513 2017-11-17 14:50:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Oh surely you jest 
931531685904216065 2017-11-17 14:37:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @BretStephensNYT @SebGorka @OCCosmoCat Blatant as blatant can be.
931528536070021121 2017-11-17 14:24:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @DeanClancy Idiot. Decentralist exactly what does that REALLY mean?
931523879201378304 2017-11-17 14:06:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Dream On Dotard. Dems are for Real People not the 1%.
931295156036427777 2017-11-16 22:57:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @TravisAllen02 Unless theres more to the Franken story or additional  accusers this does seem to be less egregious than the others offenses. The picture is clearly a joke-he was a comedian at the time.
931155896092291073 2017-11-16 13:44:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepDaveJoyce God you Lie. This is unforgivable.
931142793694797824 2017-11-16 12:51:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @DelayKathleen @renato_mariotti This is so gross. And it tells you everything you need to know about the trump regime. Wrong on Every Level.
930991855453589505 2017-11-15 02:52:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @louisvillemayor @uscapitol @RepJohnYarmuth Thank you Congressman for being part of the Impeachment proceedings. After we flip the house, well get it done.

930989879961452545 2017-11-15 02:44:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger @justinhendrix Also Oh Lordy I hope there are tapes.
930979415328206849 2017-11-15 02:02:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @RandPaul Screw You Rand, wish we could repeal your healthcare so next time you get the crap kicked out of you....
930964399409516544 2017-11-15 01:03:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind I dont know Amy, Bill has a point. We Dems do have a problem with messaging. GOP gets their lil sound bites & dont let up-its effective.
930915360295006208 2017-11-15 21:48:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianschatz Everyone has their price.
930913252556656640 2017-11-15 21:39:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @SqueakilyJr In her defense, he does seem super weird.
930913005109465089 2017-11-15 21:38:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @marcorubio Bahahaha twitter troll award!
930898963028414464 2017-11-15 20:43:02 UTC <HenslerKate> Oh God, hes doing his serious sniff thing, Coke?

930828596599500800 2017-11-15 16:03:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump God it was so nice when you were gone. This sort of thing is so beneath the office.
930793269612744704 2017-11-15 13:43:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @KrauseForIowa NEVER TRUST MCCONNELL, NEVER.
930791085349199872 2017-11-15 13:34:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Funny because while you were gone, we all realized you were a fake president!
930775049635815424 2017-11-15 12:30:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle Oh didnt you know, hes on the board!

930769977480708096 2017-11-15 12:10:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jim_Jordan Repulsive display yesterday Rep Jordan. Theres a Bonfire blazing on the Trumprussia front & say its based on a tabloid story? Disgusting.
930596366639861760 2017-11-14 00:40:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepCohen @accidntlmystic He seemed like he might want to though!
930591933084393473 2017-11-14 00:23:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepCohen @accidntlmystic Saw him today in hearing, I liked him!

929877876345917440 2017-11-12 01:05:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk Of course hes in on it. All of these Republican creepers must have a massive chat room (or whatever) on the dark web, seriously.

929869345446137857 2017-11-12 00:31:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton God so am I. People going on about what trump needs to do, as if hes actually going to do any of it. We are in very serious trouble here.
929866668574167040 2017-11-12 00:21:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @BrianPaulStuart Hey Resistance, we Kentuckians are going to need a lot of help to dump his sleazy butt in 2020! Please dont forget about us, Thanks!

929832797300281345 2017-11-12 22:06:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti Yes Renato, I would expect Mueller to look into trumps strong feelings about Russia, too. Lol even if Dotard has denied this 500 times.

929710285950275584 2017-11-12 13:59:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @Az61Ronin Yes, because God only cares about those White Evangelical Republican Haters on the Reich. Brilliant. Charlie couldnt have said it better!
929704754057445377 2017-11-12 13:37:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @tomwatson @nedprice Youre exactly right. Trump who is such a profound liar is really only capable of telling his own lies. Part of what makes him a Narcissist

929327456087048192 2017-11-11 12:38:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @Evan_McMullin @TimForgot When was it that they hadreal ideas? IMO lower taxes, smaller govt, states rights, pro military has all been code for RACISM for years.

929145004718739456 2017-11-10 00:33:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @VennMultiverse @GingerSue42 Id bet big that theres more to come on Moore.
929144166130552833 2017-11-10 00:30:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @fritchee @tedlieu @aandasgram Lol, they have quite a few kids dont they? After hearing him speak, I could be convinced.
929143687153582087 2017-11-10 00:28:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz As such a strong Christian, you will of course be denouncing your support of Roy Moore, am I right???
929141059384479745 2017-11-10 00:17:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @fritchee @tedlieu Just now noticed beady eyed Kushner has his hand on Hope Hicks shoulder. Ivankas screwed, couldnt happen to a better person 
929140273002795009 2017-11-10 00:14:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @fritchee @tedlieu Many of whom speak Russian!
929137700032188416 2017-11-10 00:04:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @BernadetteMhill Me too. At first I was in shock but now thats totally gone its just total repulsion with all things Republican.
929134551863054336 2017-11-10 23:51:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie Yes your (former???) Party has completely gone to pot Charlie. They have consumed far too much Kool-aid. Winning Over Everything is Wrong.
929133075505864705 2017-11-10 23:46:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @funder No Way!!!
929131152002158592 2017-11-10 23:38:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @BernadetteMhill Not yet. Just look at how not one Repug has spoken out about Flynn, Bannon, Gorka, Miller et al. Those quitting willing to say about trump.
929130471350554624 2017-11-10 23:35:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @BernadetteMhill Yea theyre Russian loving nut jobs for sure!
929130298696224769 2017-11-10 23:35:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @BernadetteMhill No surprise about trump & his awful cabinet but R Congress level of depravity is repulsive. McConnell, Ryan.... The descent ones are leaving
929129638193958913 2017-11-10 23:32:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @BernadetteMhill But if they think trump goes and everything goes back to normal theyre just wrong. These Cons are lying crooks without trump clearly.
929129141575790593 2017-11-10 23:30:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @BernadetteMhill Oh I have, numerous times. Rick Wilson, Max Boot, Charlie Sykes, David Frum, Anna Navarro, Rick Tyler. There are some Cons who are descent.
929127539028701189 2017-11-10 23:24:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @BernadetteMhill Yes I know he has (all that hes said) and yet he still considers himself & calls himself a republican. Thats my point. Sorry if unclear.
929122960530698241 2017-11-10 23:05:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @BernadetteMhill @TheRickWilson Rick really after all that youve seen and all that youve said. Is lowering your taxes really this important to you? If so wow, thats sad.
929121725383659520 2017-11-10 23:00:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou And thats just so damn wrong. The fat old gross Sot.
929120857829539840 2017-11-10 22:57:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxBoot @bakermind @Karlfly11 You need to ease off of the Rush, Faux News, Info Wars and Breitbart honey, youve lost your marbles.
929120074186874880 2017-11-10 22:54:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxBoot @MaryKeithBare1 @TheCenteredEgg @CaptainLouie @Mythos_Media Bull
929119819324116992 2017-11-10 22:53:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyOShea @MaxBoot Max that is a sickness in Republican land. Thats NOT how Dems roll.
929117926699032578 2017-11-10 22:45:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @DevinNunes @olgaNYC1211 @ltersinar1 Also its largely accepted that Rudy and other NYC FBI pressured Comey to make him release the hit letter on HRC 10 days before election.
929117390159400962 2017-11-10 22:43:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @DevinNunes @olgaNYC1211 @everybodyzzmama Seems to be vast majority the Repugs. They align much better ideologically. Authoritarian leaders, Christianity, white supremacy, oligarchs.
929114803360141318 2017-11-10 22:33:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @jackiecall3 @Amy_Siskind I agree. I do believe Biden might have beaten trump but hes too old for 2020. Sorry, its time for fresh faces.
929114019214086145 2017-11-10 22:30:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @tcobb_lexloci Yea that 100% True. When they all run off the sinking ship when Trumprussia hits the iceberg of Mueller we must hold them accountable. Gross
929110545701244931 2017-11-10 22:16:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobinBrenizer 100% True!
929102689497206785 2017-11-10 21:45:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @cryborg @Amy_Siskind No kidding lets make it a good one too!!!
929099796790628352 2017-11-10 21:33:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyraDSirois1 @BrianBruce7 Yea like you forget someone you dated. Total crap!
929098051360305152 2017-11-10 21:26:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti @yenaaldlooskii Hes been married for a long time. But, you cant be that unscrupulous and not engage in big time deviant behavior.
929066733771640834 2017-11-10 19:22:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @ShieldingC I worked as a cocktail waitress in college, the manager who was an old letch came on to me after hours one night. Never went back!
929021289712545798 2017-11-10 16:21:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @Davis_404 Lol ok sorry about confusion
929019966896197633 2017-11-10 16:16:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @Davis_404 I can respect that truly. But this now woman, then child. She 1. voted for trump, 2. Gains nothing accept doubt and judgement for speaking.
929019171622608896 2017-11-10 16:13:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon Pussy grabbers are not true Christians Elijah. No need to be a theologian to know that!
929018998880169984 2017-11-10 16:12:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon Lol it went unheard because I'm calm already. Also, I have no respect for a so-called Christian who backs an obvious false prophets.
929018503130157056 2017-11-10 16:10:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @Davis_404 ???
929018058429091840 2017-11-10 16:09:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon Hell No!
929017885590212608 2017-11-10 16:08:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdKrassen @dootabb In other words, you're cool with pulling a "trump"?You know get the work done and then refuse to pay? That's just wrong & our allies know it
929017451970465792 2017-11-10 16:06:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdKrassen @dootabb If you cell like backwards idiots on a world stage "free" you need to reevaluate. Also trump is trashing our regs as fast as possible.
929016952722526208 2017-11-10 16:04:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @Davis_404 You're very troubled suffered little consequence accept to getcwhst she wanted. This woman will probably have her life threatened.
929016653010042881 2017-11-10 16:03:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @Davis_404 Davis this is a very sad story. Wrong in every way. But it's not the same as a woman speaking on record about Moore male dying her when 14.
929014798796378113 2017-11-10 15:56:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon Ps it's impossible to embrace both Christ & trump. He's no Christian, if you can't see that you need some new glasses Elijah.
929014386433445888 2017-11-10 15:54:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon Stop telling me to calm down it's condescending at best. I hope you don't learn the hard way that I was absolutely right (kind of).
929001845422518272 2017-11-10 15:04:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon I don't hate you,I'm concerned/fearful of people who are so easily duped.If you can't see Moore is a hateful fake Christian you're dangerous
929001124903964672 2017-11-10 15:01:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @Cernovich @MustangGirl3 This from someone who voted for a molester for president who cheated with our enemy Russia to steal the election. But Dems cheat? Sure.
929000558018613248 2017-11-10 14:59:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @thabulldog34 @SenatorTimScott 40% cut my ass.
929000298785452032 2017-11-10 14:58:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @thabulldog34 @Shastina_Eloff Total bunch on RW nutjob lies. "Rumor had it... Cons are pathological liars who deal in Alternative Facts".
928999015596871680 2017-11-10 14:53:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @FiveRights @tpe3tpj2 @CarrollBryant Wow this is really a very disturbed statement. Everyday of the week, and ten times on Sunday. Pray for redemption, you've lost your way.
928996644158365696 2017-11-10 14:43:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @benjaminwittes @Dalton642 For 15,000,000$$$ it's beyond comprehension. Oh and how many Reoublicans have spoken out about this? F***ing crickets. Cons R Cons.
928995836746444800 2017-11-10 14:40:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @B52Malmet "Henpecking" is what women do. "Put on something nicer". This is belittling and minimizing, men have no clue about this.
928995161400635392 2017-11-10 14:38:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon Here's a "judgement" you're an idiot. If this picture is you, Moore hates you because you're Black. Everything on this list is proven (-#1)pic.twitter.com/6PHlA22d6F
928971853762310145 2017-11-10 13:05:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon And if you support him so are you. Jesus does not approve.
928971511414870016 2017-11-10 13:04:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon I don't need to prove anything. The guy is so gross it's sick!pic.twitter.com/PAiJVsvvBB
928969606496182272 2017-11-10 12:56:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanhannity @dumptrump33 God knows there has to be done nasty stuff in Hannity's  closet-he has the moral fiber of a slug.
928967990028259328 2017-11-10 12:50:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon This is a sign that the Republican Party is morally bankrupt and their brand of Christianity is fake just like those who profess to believe.
928960188018843648 2017-11-10 12:19:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Frances_Fisher @RedTRaccoon @Animals4Bernie My gosh that is such a sad, sad story. I'm so sorry that was your childhood. I sincerely hope that you've managed to find love in your life.
928945764662960128 2017-11-10 11:21:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon You're a sick man and you do it in the name of Jesus? Sick! Repent you sinner!
928944657236660224 2017-11-10 11:17:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @RBReich This is a gross statement/question.
928866677852377088 2017-11-09 06:07:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnOSullivan36 She works for Murdoch. She comes up with convoluted stories designed to get people excited and then very discouraged. She's full of crap.
928829311343382528 2017-11-09 03:38:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @RobbieResister @NicolleDWallace Pretty racy for Charlie! Good job Charlie.
928822483075072000 2017-11-09 03:11:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @DevinNunes @rmecheeya @JanzforCongress Nunes is such an obvious crook. I hope he's sweating bullets.
928720529502212098 2017-11-09 20:26:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu Yes Rep Lieu, I'm pretty sure God is pissed! LMAO.
928680328117571584 2017-11-09 17:46:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdanClay I did. Sadly it seems dead on. We just need to keep moving forward. They're not going to get it. They can take my knee.
928677541224820738 2017-11-09 17:35:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @bwcjmc @danpfeiffer One after another, he's so gross!
928662707141824512 2017-11-09 16:36:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnJHarwood @bobdiz2 Oh I see you did not. I'm wondered if you were small business person getting screwed despite promises.
928662324940099584 2017-11-09 16:35:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnJHarwood @bobdiz2 Did you vote for them?
928651476003704832 2017-11-09 15:52:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @HoneyDemForce I see big changes coming as a result (after we clean up this mess)Improved: healthcare, race relations, infrastructure, jobs. All trump lies
928650913631305728 2017-11-09 15:50:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @HoneyDemForce I said then and I still feel very strongly, I'll never again be a complacent Democrat. EVER.

928623144621002752 2017-11-09 13:59:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kno @trouble224 Yea it seems pretty random. I have a couple of times for no obvious reason. Dirty words pretty much, same words others use all the time???
928596840395759616 2017-11-09 12:15:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones Bye bye Betsy, don't let the door hit you in the ass!
928591069553586176 2017-11-09 11:52:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein @DDevareaux @BetsyGervasi Me too Betsy. If they were really descent, they wouldn't have R next to their names!
928590614937169920 2017-11-09 11:50:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein I've pretty much always done that. Trust me, there isn't much reason to do anything else and there hasn't been for years. Cons Lie a Lot.

928310662266261507 2017-11-08 17:18:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @RaineyMcdonald @thedealwithalex Never thought I'd say this but thanks Tea Party, your system is really effective. Just think what we can do when we use it for good.
928309561689362432 2017-11-08 17:13:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobinBrenizer Geeez I just got a little weepy reading your tweet. It's so true though.

928252686969049088 2017-11-08 13:27:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattmfm I'm with you! It's just disgusting that they pretend they don't know or approve. Dems need to call each & everyone of them out on this.
928250666719567874 2017-11-08 13:19:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @aravosis @RickyCam @dontiann I don't know but it's a deal breaker for me! Lord gone but still have a couple of really gross ones!!!
928250135922073600 2017-11-08 13:17:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @aravosis @RickyCam Non "healthcare" Non tax cuts for middle class. Despite their best efforts to lie, the Rs are losing their unique ability to smile & lie.
928249713417125889 2017-11-08 13:15:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @aravosis Yea shits getting bad when Sickening Santorum admits the truth!

928243531172470784 2017-11-08 12:51:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Alt_Spicerlies @Serendipity7845 I agree we've stood for these for years but "we" have not delivered the message particularly well. We need a simple way to do it! E.g."MAGA"
928242507259006976 2017-11-08 12:47:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @Alt_Spicerlies Add gun control and you have a winner!

928098688848875520 2017-11-07 03:15:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @carrieksada @MSPOA Funny how pretty much all of the most successful states are Democratic but your stupid racist statement says it all!

928093456727146497 2017-11-07 02:54:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @urwalder @ChrisMurphyCT @runningscott59 As I have 0 faith in Cons, I'm going with NRA for 100.

928072188099530752 2017-11-07 01:30:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger Jennifer,it's time for you to defect. If Gillespie was so corrupted by trumphate, the only thing true about conservatives today is the Con.
928071209975205888 2017-11-07 01:26:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @donnabrazile @allinwithchris I usually watch your show Chris, not tonight. She can "go to hell". Her crap filled book is the last thing our party needs right now.

928018746417078272 2017-11-07 21:58:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahPalinUSA Hey "Locked&Loaded" what's shameful is all of those Republicans pretending to care and yet actually doing nothing but taking NRA $$$! SICK.
928015630292353025 2017-11-07 21:45:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @TopherSpiro AWESOME.
928011850536669187 2017-11-07 21:30:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomPerez Please stop elevating Sen Sanders & his platform. He is not a darn Democrat!
927981872973524994 2017-11-07 19:31:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @justapedn Our only hope, foreign nations assume it's probably false because they consider the source. Sad.

927912454029529089 2017-11-07 14:55:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @RayRLibrandi Bahahaha no doubt about it!
927901992160321536 2017-11-07 14:14:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Greed. Both for power and money.
927894409361928193 2017-11-07 13:44:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @olgaNYC1211 Yes, just that fact tells us what we really need to know. That fact and his allegiance to Putin are among his few consistencies.
927893239717351424 2017-11-07 13:39:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @KrauseForIowa @JASVPUMP Nunes is obviously an enemy of the state. Sure hope he gets flushed with the Trumprussia purge.

927887248930025472 2017-11-07 13:15:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @DebraMessing @AlanDersh There should be a law that you must keep your lying lips closed. We see you for who you are, a complicit partner in crime. Save It.

927745713357942789 2017-11-06 03:53:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jayge26 @riromtz Wow that's is so terribly sad and we Dems know how critical gun control is. We will fight in your son's honor Richard.

927718485995737091 2017-11-06 02:04:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaryKeithBare1 @ezlusztig I totally agree Elliott. It's past time for Dems to stand up to the NRA. They've gotten to be way too powerful. Time to take our power back.
927716027269566464 2017-11-06 01:55:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @Nosafetypinneed @PastorDScott @jtull17 Yes resist I will and you enjoy your last liddle ride on the Treason train. Ps I'm not screaming.
927709628170932224 2017-11-06 01:29:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @suevisa @ChrisMurphyCT It's pathetic how completely complicit the Cons are with the terrorists known as the NRA. I've really just had it with the gun loving haters

927707536073117697 2017-11-06 01:21:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Nosafetypinneed @PastorDScott @jtull17 How are you liking the obvious conspiring with the Russians to steal the Presidency "from day one". You were a school principal? SHAMEFUL.
927706901223231488 2017-11-06 01:18:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @Nosafetypinneed @PastorDScott @jtull17 Yea ok, I'm not believing you, at all.
927651044401799169 2017-11-06 21:36:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @viacampmimi @DerekCressman Nothing to see there! It gets dramatically worse every day.

927631186108866560 2017-11-06 20:18:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz is really enjoying the sound of his own voice. Shameless exploration of terroristic act by Christian hater. Cruz knows about Evil.
927618287206268928 2017-11-06 19:26:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @olgaNYC1211 @luc_chat No they bought and payed for it. No surprise.

927556446358855681 2017-11-06 15:21:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @GeauxScalise Sick support of gun industry even after you were shot. Now is precisely the time to debate gun control you dolt.
927555925266878464 2017-11-06 15:19:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @GeauxScalise Saw you lying on Faux News. So much for your near death experience changing your lying ways. Sick tax cut for Uber Rich.
927553803972378624 2017-11-06 15:10:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @cassandra17lina @HomewardBounder What a total Crock of Crap.
927544797774123015 2017-11-06 14:34:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Same N, I'll be praying that Northam wins on Tuesday. Good Lord willing, Sir 
927544103763628033 2017-11-06 14:32:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 No N, he did far more than lie on a form. He reps Russia & Ukraine. Lied on a form, that's a good one. He's a Traitor, just ask Mueller.
927543551482892288 2017-11-06 14:29:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Uhhh yea I kind of got that Faux News was extreme right. They've helped to create these extremists who reject facts and science.
927543103933812736 2017-11-06 14:28:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @BoddenYvette @Billbrowder @justapedn Just a little reminder of who's boss, no doubt.
927542823934623744 2017-11-06 14:26:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 We can agree on that. Just another Republican Traitor. So sick.
927542324397248512 2017-11-06 14:24:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @BoddenYvette @Billbrowder @justapedn Squeezing trump.
927542073376624640 2017-11-06 14:23:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 And all those folks at Faux News? Media Lefty too???
927541740571160576 2017-11-06 14:22:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Yes they are def universal. Not more on L. In fact, I would argue more on R but it's all wrong and far too common. Pigs r pigs, regardless.
927541299691048961 2017-11-06 14:20:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 How you feeling about General Flynn?
927540056067362817 2017-11-06 14:15:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 That's good, I guess.
927539730866233344 2017-11-06 14:14:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Wrong how many female on R Congress? I don't see Ds meeting on healthcare rt women without any women. Ds not perfect, much better than Rs.
927539370915254273 2017-11-06 14:13:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 No I don't think so.
927539158167539712 2017-11-06 14:12:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 How convenient. Still in military?
927539025812049920 2017-11-06 14:11:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Truth hurts N, but it's still true.
927538794613657600 2017-11-06 14:10:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 I think I probably know more about that than you do N.
927538628154273793 2017-11-06 14:10:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 And trump did NOT "WIN". Conspiring with our enemy to steal a presidency is not winning, it's Treason.
927538297030828032 2017-11-06 14:08:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Yes it would have been terrible if a brilliant rational woman had won. Instead we have Traitor trump raping our country on a daily basis.
927537865441112071 2017-11-06 14:07:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 It could be worse at least they didn't vote for dumb-dumb or Traitor Stein.
927537530832080898 2017-11-06 14:05:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 That's crap, sex scandals are universal. Trump, Ailes, O'Reilly, Halperin... you just take note of those on the left N.
927537015670956033 2017-11-06 14:03:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Well that was productive.
927535143887175680 2017-11-06 13:56:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Yes I will cont to do so bc it's true. Way more racist/sexist haters on R than L. It's just the truth. You don't have to agree N. Write-in??
927533066117177349 2017-11-06 13:48:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnBoelWAVE3 @MichaelSchmel11 Yes
927532436199825408 2017-11-06 13:45:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Wrong is wrong is wrong. Just like the Good Book says N.
927531966169255936 2017-11-06 13:43:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Or maybe you'd rather not discuss???
927531565009309696 2017-11-06 13:42:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Thanks! It was the word "kindly" that I found funny anyway, not ma'am. You forgot to say who you voted for!!!
927531055619432451 2017-11-06 13:40:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Oh wow burn. Why do cons seem to think Dems think they're immune to the same dirty power crap that infects them? We are not, obviously.
927530316893491200 2017-11-06 13:37:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Lol pretty funny. I think it's funny when young guys call me "miss". I grew up in Northern Indiana, we didn't say "ma'am" but I'm used to it

927528257737682944 2017-11-06 13:29:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @theSopranoist @DaShanneStokes @MitchBeatty Yes, many. They like those rubles.
927528108038778880 2017-11-06 13:28:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @DearAuntCrabby @DaShanneStokes Oh don't kid yourself. They care, they're all for it.
927527707583401984 2017-11-06 13:26:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeKeene No he shot himself-so much for that argument.
927526955414638592 2017-11-06 13:23:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Who did you vote for?
927526104872767488 2017-11-06 13:20:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 No I conflated lack of sep Church/State with the Racist, sexist, gun loving, white supremacist haters who dominate the Republican Party.
927525551920893953 2017-11-06 13:18:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Hmmmm I have my doubts on that.
927525192485822464 2017-11-06 13:16:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 No offense to "ma'am" (I live in Kentucky for Pete's sake). I also acknowledged your blessing was well intended. It just assumes a lot.
927524501511901184 2017-11-06 13:14:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 No but I'll bet you conflate the two. Trump talking about God all the time really makes me want to vomit. He's so far from Christian.
927523996467453952 2017-11-06 13:12:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Lol coolest thing about Austin is that it's in Texas.
927523294198329344 2017-11-06 13:09:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 I disagree chilling has allowed these Christian extremists to use God/Guns to corrupt our govt. Folks need to be reminded sep Church/State.
927522838583660544 2017-11-06 13:07:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 I know I just says thanks or you too but really I find it offensive to e.g. Have checkout lady at target say "god bless" with my receipt. 
927522462383919104 2017-11-06 13:06:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Did she also find GUNS? Very close association in Texas!
927521929459830784 2017-11-06 13:03:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 I know that N, just letting you know that really it's a bit offensive to me (I'm not alone) Also, "kindly"??? Funny word choice.
927521484343562244 2017-11-06 13:02:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Yea not at all.
927521113743200256 2017-11-06 13:00:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Totally respect people's right/choice to worship whatever god they want to. Please don't shove it down my throat even with best intentions.
927520462623604737 2017-11-06 12:58:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Same.
927518266268045313 2017-11-06 12:49:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Really,  you don't get it? Your "god bless you" assumes I/we share your beliefs. I do not. I find your assumption that I do, offensive.
927516723858890753 2017-11-06 12:43:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlanDersh @bexl888 @Brookssista1 Ding ding ding, we have a winner!
927516414738681856 2017-11-06 12:42:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlanDersh @SpinDr Pretty sure it's comped.
927516168847491072 2017-11-06 12:41:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlanDersh @courtofsatyrs He's complicit with the sex crimes. Sick stuff.
927515641501929473 2017-11-06 12:38:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlanDersh Now Collusion is not a crime? Tell that to Mueller. Hope they get you for your sick child abuse. And STOP calling yourself a liberal!

927512127451095040 2017-11-06 12:24:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @PastorDScott @DeborahOH10 Yea oh I guess you forgot, every one in trump's camp dirty dealings with Russia. This week, the Flynns 
927507730750898176 2017-11-06 12:07:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT @Emden_Allen Be quiet, your ignorance is showing.
927507568938901504 2017-11-06 12:06:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @dumptrump33 @ChrisMurphyCT Yes Senator, they can sleep. They'll be counting their rubles.
927499312069861377 2017-11-06 11:34:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Have a good day at work. My name is Kate.
927498966287167488 2017-11-06 11:32:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Total BS N, you can "like" it all you want, it will never happen and Rand Paul totally knows that!
927498651248877568 2017-11-06 11:31:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Very generous with the blessings aren't you? It's offensive N.
927498452501536774 2017-11-06 11:30:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Basically not.
927498208296820737 2017-11-06 11:29:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChurchofSatan @ElijahEOkon @PastorDScott This is crazy talk.
927493033603584000 2017-11-06 11:09:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 At 3% for good reason. "Libertarian" is really just a bunch of bull. Isn't that what Cons claim to be? Small govt, state power, budget? Not
927491418033147904 2017-11-06 11:02:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 The Rs shared every bit as bad as this in this election. Don't kid yourself. What was the MS-13 gang crap?
927375729800761345 2017-11-05 03:22:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias You too. I can live without the God Bless but I'll assume you meant it in a good way. How about "have a good week"?
927375191302397952 2017-11-05 03:20:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Ummm no, sex pretty much inevitable, guns, not so much. What's nuts about sex Ed is that it's even in question.
927374543706091521 2017-11-05 03:18:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias I don't believe that's politics that's crazy people shooting people for no particular reason other than they're  mad as hell and have guns.
927373936312180736 2017-11-05 03:15:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Mandatory classes in HS? Wtf that's nuts.
927373759266336769 2017-11-05 03:15:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Yes we do. That's just crazy crap Rs & NRA tells you. So not true!
927373463689613313 2017-11-05 03:13:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias He was a nutjob just like Vegas dude. Crazy haters "on both sides".
927372797588004865 2017-11-05 03:11:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias That's just not true. Rs won't discuss any gun regs-it's perverse.
927372462865768451 2017-11-05 03:09:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Are you serious as if Dems could ever take your precious guns. For truly responsible folks, I'm fine with guns. Way too easy to get now!
927372044806836227 2017-11-05 03:08:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias That's funny we're always saying we're sorry. Right wingers, not so much.
927371709287714816 2017-11-05 03:06:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Sure but I don't really think it was "political" just hateful/crazy just like the trump nut in Vegas.
927371298438819840 2017-11-05 03:05:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Lol no thanks. We are not all extremists. And I'd much rather fall on the side of decency. Healthcare, immigration, gun control.
927370416074690560 2017-11-05 03:01:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias "Political violence"?
927370053804281856 2017-11-05 03:00:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow @karesf Lol me too. When did you decide you were a Dem?
927369919120990209 2017-11-05 02:59:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl Ok whatever.
927369778863529984 2017-11-05 02:59:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Your comment "They have more in common than you think"
927369347336757248 2017-11-05 02:57:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl We are a democratic society Michael. Are you young or what?
927368862777184256 2017-11-05 02:55:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow @karesf Then what are you?
927368576272621569 2017-11-05 02:54:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow Well I do, but I'm not young.
927366429728526336 2017-11-05 02:46:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl 
927366240955523072 2017-11-05 02:45:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @brooklyner27 Yuck!
927365960008372224 2017-11-05 02:44:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl I'm not a "leftist". Well you have very predictable/simple positions and 8 followers & you don't say where you live so natural assumption
927365223916408832 2017-11-05 02:41:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl War is sending the govt into extreme debt
927364778263236608 2017-11-05 02:39:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl I'm seeing now you're probably a bot!
927364656087359488 2017-11-05 02:38:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl 6-8 fetuses do not live if delivered. "Non-viable"
927364417263685632 2017-11-05 02:38:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl Also twisted "pro human rights" with anti abortion? You have very simplistic thinking Michael.
927364197800964096 2017-11-05 02:37:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl Sad you equate "guns" with "liberty". The two have absolutely no connection to one another in my world.
927363598518833152 2017-11-05 02:34:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl Calling a mass of non-viable cells "a baby" is a hit if a stretch. When men have babies, they'll be entitled to an opinion on abortion.
927363039971741696 2017-11-05 02:32:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Hope you're voting fir Northam on Tuesday!
927362624211300352 2017-11-05 02:30:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl Lol pro gun & pro life, sure, that makes absolutely no sense. Anti welfare and healthcare too?
927362156710023168 2017-11-05 02:29:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias I used to think that as well, I no longer believe that.
927361718476595200 2017-11-05 02:27:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl So I'm to assume you're both pro gun and pro choice?
927361358957547521 2017-11-05 02:25:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl That is BS. Australia had a gun problem (too many gun deaths) so they got rid of the dumb guns and now they don't! Facts matter Michael.
927360915531497472 2017-11-05 02:24:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias I'd say that happened quite awhile ago. Just saying NOT all white ladies voted for dumb-dumb.
927360484780773379 2017-11-05 02:22:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl Because only people who should have access have access?
927360105229770752 2017-11-05 02:20:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl They kill people, way too many people. Isn't that obvious Michael?
927359622679277568 2017-11-05 02:18:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Only about half, right. I'm in the good half!
927359236924936193 2017-11-05 02:17:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @ShireSteve Yea you kind of do, lol. Good to know you're a lovable liberal!
927358786922340353 2017-11-05 02:15:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl I heard they said he "may have been"dishonorably discharged. Guns suck and Americans have way too many. When we get rid of Cons, guns go too
927354846998683648 2017-11-05 01:59:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @CatholcGayHermi @Victrixyl Well every mass shooter in the last 51 years used a damn gun Michael. Funny top 20 politicians who received "donations" from NRA, all repugs
927353524056358912 2017-11-05 01:54:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @Weaver_keith Yes but David is a Con and he likes to pretend that it's just trump. There are many crooked cons obviously. Far more dirty Cons than clean.
927349749702955009 2017-11-05 01:39:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace @bmiddleton51 @renato_mariotti Will do, Nicole has been taking no prisoners on her show lately. She is really speaking truth to power, lately. You'll be an asset Renato.
927346555727859714 2017-11-05 01:27:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @jptoner50 @ksqueed Yes I know, I just think that's total BS. I'm guessing those people sitting there in that church felt pretty terrified so he was a terrorist
927337688574853120 2017-11-05 00:51:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram @tonyschwartz Many of us know Tony, many.
927336420448047104 2017-11-05 00:46:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @alchemyst44 @4everNeverTrump Wtf of course it was terrorism.
927335355535282176 2017-11-05 00:42:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @onejonesshe That's because those are most definitely not his words. He would never say that, EVER!
927333964347592704 2017-11-05 00:37:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @SamEllison11 Well Texas is pretty extreme IMO but that tweet is repulsive.
927332098750414849 2017-11-05 00:29:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @SamEllison11 So gross, this from a governor? That's so gross, even from Texas!
927329723025326082 2017-11-05 00:20:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRA @GregAbbott_TX My God this is the Governor of Texas? How disgusting.
927328447919161345 2017-11-05 00:15:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @Anativeamerican @k8innyc She's prob a bot.
927299009819144194 2017-11-05 22:18:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz Guess you have 360,000$$$ +++ reasons to resist gun laws Ted. Is the check from the NRA really that valuable to you?
927275260113768448 2017-11-05 20:43:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyraDSirois1 @RobinBrenizer Wow that's so bad. Guns kill.
927247952862695429 2017-11-05 18:55:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @AndreaChalupa Very sad.
927188678413357058 2017-11-05 14:59:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @JimKilbane Just this is blatantly corrupt. The Treasonous trump regime must be stopped sooner, not later.
927174818646122496 2017-11-05 14:04:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProudResister @mattmfm This is so gross. The Cons have absolutely no bottom line any more. Whatever works is just fine with them. Even Conspiring with Russia.
927169420149051393 2017-11-05 13:43:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahsMimi @boyndog Yea he looks spineless. Mitch is a mean ass SOB who WILL do anything to WIN!!!
927169079575810048 2017-11-05 13:41:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @soledadobrien @marciaknutsen @JoyAnnReid Also, Dershowitz is obviously a lying crook.I don't care who he was. I haven't seen him on tv going on about how there's no collusion lately
927160148208095232 2017-11-05 13:06:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @politico Trump is a chump. Don't hold your breath on that.
927159661668851714 2017-11-05 13:04:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan Wow,1200$ a year? Do you know what you can do with that post card? Ps we are holding YOU responsible of trump. Impeach or pay for Treason.
927032314659528704 2017-11-04 04:38:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @perlmutations More like cockroaches I'd say. P
927016282070843392 2017-11-04 03:34:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti He is a very disturbed malignant narcissist. He's going to use American lives to try and keep himself in office. He must be stopped.
927013031585951744 2017-11-04 03:21:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @BruceBartlett @downhiller1976 Definitely needed. Descent people have been turned off by Gillespie's racist mega phone rallying calls. Virginians are lovers, not haters.
927011007272243202 2017-11-04 03:13:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @downhiller1976 @BruceBartlett This says it all. What an Honest and Sad statement.
926954931529093120 2017-11-04 23:30:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Well it's good. They need to grow.
926950133807316995 2017-11-04 23:11:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias No I'm not a fan. The Papa is a redneck with a lot of money.  The pizza is terrible, the right can have it. Long Live Mellow Mushroom.
926879663653302282 2017-11-04 18:31:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @dumptrump33 There must be some data base somewhere for crook politicians who are grossly unqualified who wouldn't know a fact if it slapped him in face.
926878793226125312 2017-11-04 18:28:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @MichaelJacque10 @PinskyZinsk YOU SUPPORT MOBSTERS.
926873113555623936 2017-11-04 18:05:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @JillWineBanks Smart nice doctor or a hating trump Bigot? Don't choose a hater again, Northam is a We Man, McAullife is a Me Man, Dems for Democracy 17.
926847672274898944 2017-11-04 16:24:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Too bad trump's behavior never matches his rhetoric. Putin has placed the King of Fake News in our Whitehouse. Democracy diminished daily.
926803807190761473 2017-11-04 13:30:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @Smith83K @tribelaw What she did was reckless and self-serving Laurence. I'm no longer loving her.
926798253110149122 2017-11-04 13:08:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 Gaetz is really gross even for a Con.

926775634352852992 2017-11-04 11:38:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @krassenstein Of course he did and of course it's worse than watergate. We don't need Carl Bernstein to tell us that.
926774635106103296 2017-11-04 11:34:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs Wow that's prettty bad, I mean good.
926535459504869376 2017-11-03 19:44:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @mshopemac @SaysHummingbird Not a hardship, his pizza sucks.
926530810697666562 2017-11-03 19:25:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @geegeebythesea @AynRandPaulRyan @WendyMeer11 Ridiculous

926466251261644805 2017-11-03 15:09:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti @JillWineBanks What are they doing?Our only hope at this point is unity.Their choice to divide right now is completely wrong and self serving. Won't forget
926464197705289728 2017-11-03 15:00:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @katekahn1 @jcwilder She can't win with them either. IMO.
926463842762321921 2017-11-03 14:59:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @jcwilder @kburton40 Did you vote for cand of your choice?
926443531337633792 2017-11-03 13:38:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @ivye_m Me too!!!
926440148904095744 2017-11-03 13:25:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm Sadly it's probably true. I'm not sure he remembers what he had for breakfast.
926438299371270144 2017-11-03 13:17:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs Trump will find a way. Clearly rules/laws don't apply to him. He's proven this to be true. He's a Mobster & a Con. Sessions is toast.
926437098726543365 2017-11-03 13:13:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs Sorry, trump is going to fire Mueller no matter what we do. When that happens, we hit the streets and demand congress impeach his ass.
926436016638095361 2017-11-03 13:08:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kanew She is awful. Vote her out Tennessee!
926430313445720064 2017-11-03 12:46:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA He's going there Richard we all know it.Trump must trump.He knows Mueller has him & he can't take the heat. When he does, we hit the street.
926429381140115456 2017-11-03 12:42:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost Sure hope they meet in Russia and trump stays there!
926426285265518592 2017-11-03 12:30:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump No matter what Dems have done, it doesn't compare to TREASON. do suck on that on your way to Asia.
926423660394631168 2017-11-03 12:19:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenWarren Shut Up Senator! Let it go. Dems don't need/want you throwing grenades at our party. HRC would have won either way. NO INFIGHTING
926422817981247488 2017-11-03 12:16:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarkJKremer So true Mark. We're not perfect but we're a hell of a lot better than these pathological lying Cons!
926421602480394242 2017-11-03 12:11:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @Hillaryh4444Hos @cal_beu This is repulsive. This is putin-like and it's evil. Hope you trump folks are proud of your evil leader.
926421143191465985 2017-11-03 12:09:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @CarlosM61269234 @AllenWSnyder It's really really dumb but I'm not sure I'd give it the dumbest award.
926417485968150529 2017-11-03 11:55:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @HouseGOP @SenWarren @Rondo2 Vast majority of cuts go to companies & very rich (neither need) middle class gets virtually nothing. That's why it's wrong & dumb. FACTS!
926413276631715841 2017-11-03 11:38:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @HouseGOP @SenWarren @Rondo2 Wrong & dumb!
926412974868385792 2017-11-03 11:37:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @HouseGOP @SenWarren Senator, please don't cause problems within our party. We must be united so that we can win elections. Please!!!

926257550089248769 2017-11-02 01:19:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @AsteadWesley @dstfelix How disgusting. I'm very glad to hear they were fired at least!

926211569830293504 2017-11-02 22:17:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila This is a sickening story. Really gross.
926185379501404161 2017-11-02 20:32:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaryKeithBare1 @MarkWarner This is so wrong. So many believed she actually killed people.Fake Russian News looks just like Right Wing crazy propaganda. Using Feat/Hate
926175206938378240 2017-11-02 19:52:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @AngrierWHStaff @RVAwonk @MelissaJPeltier @cindycrum Yay He seems great! Go Ralph

926120945785458689 2017-11-02 16:16:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyraDSirois1 @TheRickWilson He's probably permanently "closed up shop" if ya know what I mean.
926106260671549440 2017-11-02 15:18:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @shoreboy1961 @AhmedBaba_ Couldn't agree more Ahmed. Clearly mistakes were made. Let's learn from them and move forward as a unified party.
926104644010561538 2017-11-02 15:12:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @VABVOX Leave off "pretty much" and you got it right!
926102957636112385 2017-11-02 15:05:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias I sure hope not, he's too damn old!!! We need younger leaders.
926102674197663752 2017-11-02 15:04:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @OhNoSheTwitnt Bahahaha so true, I'd rather drink Russian prostitute piss.

926063310516244480 2017-11-02 12:27:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @Dangchick1 @washingtonpost When you start at the top with Donny the Duffus, don't be surprised about the losers he hires for key positions.
926052983204392960 2017-11-02 11:46:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila Me too, smart, classy and funny works for me every time.

925902146209505280 2017-11-01 01:47:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @PersuasivePR So very much. I'm repulsed by Cons in Congress who pretend not to know how criminal these people really are. Obviously, many of them are too
925900649417658368 2017-11-01 01:41:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @PersuasivePR No way.
925899173387436032 2017-11-01 01:35:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @facebook @Amy_Siskind Omg that's really horrible.

925892396407246848 2017-11-01 01:08:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven @funder No they only sell sucky pizza.
925891736773197825 2017-11-01 01:06:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianschatz @DeeDeeSchwartz3 Sure does seem that way. He literally doesn't have one descent cabinet member.
925889006474285056 2017-11-01 00:55:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Same. We get bogged down in our own BS.
925886476327571456 2017-11-01 00:45:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @DeeDeeSchwartz3 Yea once Kushner finally spoke I realized why he'd been so quiet up until that point. "I had no contacts with Russia" (nose grows)
925885728415997952 2017-11-01 00:42:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier @ryrysven @zacapoet Really, I'm sick of that too!

925880328245338112 2017-11-01 00:20:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @VoteMarsha Ps this fake tape is so repulsive!

925869769152253953 2017-11-01 23:38:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence Well lowest point in a modern day President's term of office. It's hell on earth.
925865807640453120 2017-11-01 23:23:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier @chrislhayes His "thoughts and prayers" now that's really gross.

925860223881015297 2017-11-01 23:00:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnJHarwood @Sandy81798642 Much worse is what he's thinking about doing. If he fires Mueller, True American Patriots must hit the streets.
925854733109223425 2017-11-01 22:39:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Yes I'm sure they'd be happy to help in that regard! Bring it on Ukraine, Bring it on!!!
925851857242787840 2017-11-01 22:27:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Well good for you for getting out! It's not a philosophy I've dealt with personally. I probably wouldn't tolerate it very well at all 
925849381752004609 2017-11-01 22:17:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @fosterbr2013 @will_c_fischer It's So Gross, who this man has shown himself to be. Shameful, I wonder how many soldiers of color/women he's screwed over, over the years.
925848382689693697 2017-11-01 22:13:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu @christinaph84 @MarkIKendrick The Republicans in the house are complicit. Dems would impeach him in a minute.
925846843313000448 2017-11-01 22:07:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @sassyteapot63 @grantstern Oh but Grant he was just l lil unpaid volunteer. I'm sure those world leaders will be thrilled when they find out.

925842252852875264 2017-11-01 21:49:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu @christinaph84 Until we flip the House, they're powerless to impeach trump. The Cons r complicit in this power grab, pretending not to know he's a Traitor
925841819153457152 2017-11-01 21:47:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu @christinaph84 YesChristina they do.Rep Lieu is leading by sharing regularly the fact that he knows how corrupt trump is. We need leaders now.Rs r corrupt

925840553975144449 2017-11-01 21:42:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu @ReallyAmerican1 100%
925840404431474695 2017-11-01 21:42:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu What a completely shameful excuse for a man he is. He's an International Disgrace and Embarrassment. Russian Mobsters Suck!
925837765115301888 2017-11-01 21:31:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Yea not Donny the Dotard.Statesman? He is the exact opposite. Watching him piss on our Democracy every day is so discouraging & demoralizing
925832115715010560 2017-11-01 21:09:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @ShaunKing Well I'm sure Mitch Mealy Mouthed McConnell is very proud. These people do NOT need any encouragement. Behold the hateful trump effect!

925756293079592960 2017-11-01 16:07:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @girlsreallyrule @jemelehill Schnatter is an ass flying around Louisville in his helicopter thinking he's Joe Kool. Really, just another racist hater with money.

925733138462109696 2017-11-01 14:35:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProudResister Sick truth
925730833629089795 2017-11-01 14:26:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 How sad is that?
925719217483247616 2017-11-01 13:40:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @sarahkendzior Bahahaha perfect response.
925695993856843776 2017-11-01 12:08:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Smith83K @TheRickyDavila If he opened his mouth he lied. It's a very dominant family trait!
925695485897334786 2017-11-01 12:06:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @TDPattillo Just throwing red meat to his base, they don't give a crap about true facts. They just like all of the hate & resentment. It's perverse.
925694483433426944 2017-11-01 12:02:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mikel_Jollett Perfect response! Really gross that he would use his child like this but NOT surprising at all.
925694092268404736 2017-11-01 12:00:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @wiwa1953 @JohnOSullivan36 I voted for Obama twice&would again but first election what was HRC? 62 yrs? It was a sexist thing. When black man beats white woman-telling
925692197772591104 2017-11-01 11:53:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @JohnOSullivan36 @wiwa1953 No I don't believe it was. She was more qualified than BHO and 100X more qualified than trump. Sad statement.
925690247471620096 2017-11-01 11:45:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @bill_auclair Kelly has shown himself to be a hating SOB. We know everything we need to know about him. Watson lies & refusal to apologize says it all.
925682559874461696 2017-11-01 11:14:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 The Republicans are Retched.

925391789556723713 2017-10-31 15:59:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @angry_gram Me too! I think he'd be a great Attorney General.
925391535511932928 2017-10-31 15:58:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mikel_Jollett He's as gross as trump.
925390771431399424 2017-10-31 15:55:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @SRuhle @RacerX57217102 Yea no. Much more possible that he's the closed minded Bigot he appears to be. He keeps telling us who he is, believe him.
925372811593617409 2017-10-31 14:44:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @Evan_Rosenfeld Wow those are pretty bad. Guess it's hard to cheese it up when you're being investigated for treason.

925337439345897473 2017-10-31 12:23:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @kbrunocrafts @haldonahue His performance was gross. He is not to be trusted, that's for sure!
925337171619401728 2017-10-31 12:22:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @Salon @SafetyPinDaily Yes he knew what Manafort was. Trump knows how people make their $$$. Paul lived in his building for Pete's sake, of course he knew.

925161985125376000 2017-10-30 00:46:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 @NaveenMalli I don't believe that. He surrounds himself with shady people, those who are willing to be around him!
925161681885519872 2017-10-30 00:45:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 He's just another trump ass. A bold faced liar.

924978602340487168 2017-10-30 12:37:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrianKarem Yea between trump & his campaign chairman. Drip, drip, drip Dotard they're coming for you. ENJOY!
924976923947732992 2017-10-30 12:30:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 Blast Clinton. For Sure.
924841641327890432 2017-10-29 03:33:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @MKRIZSA50 Yes he wouldn't dare hold a Town Hall. Most of their agenda points will hurt many Kentuckians.
924839064469168128 2017-10-29 03:23:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @MKRIZSA50 He quit caring about real live Kentuckians many years ago. He needs to go.
924826926698594305 2017-10-29 02:34:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @aliasvaughn @shakirc Trump is a lot more than a clown.He managed to get himself elected (even if he had help from our enemy) he's a master manipulator. Dangerous
924823488917012480 2017-10-29 02:21:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @barry_corindia Bahahaha that's hilarious. See you in DC sister, if he cans Mueller!
924823006702133249 2017-10-29 02:19:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @JRubinBlogger Jennifer, you clearly know that the Republicans in Congress today have made their deals with the devil, save very few. People Over Party.
924821654940811264 2017-10-29 02:13:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @lauferlaw @Alt_Spicerlies @blankslate2017 Yes The Dotard has already started that.
924819661455273985 2017-10-29 02:06:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @JRubinBlogger Both.
924798870642622466 2017-10-29 00:43:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @DrXPsychologist @SenWhitehouse Yea just like their fake crap healthcare. If you're afraid for people to know what's in it-it's really bad.
924785852059996160 2017-10-29 23:51:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 He's so dangerous.
924772035993260034 2017-10-29 22:56:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @jackTweets11 @tenax666 @Alexredna Clinton payed company for opportunity research after the Rs did, by the way. trump camp colluded with Russians. Apples and Oranges.
924771509838712832 2017-10-29 22:54:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @jackTweets11 @tenax666 @Alexredna Wrong. That's trump camp bullshit and nothing more.
924771140425445377 2017-10-29 22:53:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @JenKernsUSA You should be very ashamed of what you did today on AM Joy. There's not enough $ to make that acceptable. Shame on you!
924767414398701569 2017-10-29 22:38:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Amy_Siskind Again! I wonder what would have to happen for him to take a weekend off? Hope we don't find out.
924766793046077441 2017-10-29 22:35:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @jackTweets11 @tenax666 @Alexredna She did not receive info from Russia. She and her camp did not meet or collide with Russia. Trump team worked with Russia, very different.
924766166807187457 2017-10-29 22:33:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @jackTweets11 @tenax666 The Party of Me is only concerned with helping themselves and their precious Donor Class. They sow hate and resentment and fear. RESIST.
924765158047735808 2017-10-29 22:29:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Yea wow that is really wrong. WSJ goes Info Wars on TrumpRussia, right there is your "Fake News" from Murdoch of course. He's a CROOK TOO!
924762417267118081 2017-10-29 22:18:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven @leahmcelrath Women are more honest and accountable,though far from perfect. Collins and Murkowski have shown strength but don't forget Marsha Blackburn.
924760586122158080 2017-10-29 22:11:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyOShea @TeaPainUSA Just the beginning.
924753540987473920 2017-10-29 21:43:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Russian_Starr I know people who are racists and not ignorant, in the traditional sense. Just pig headed and stuck in a hateful mind set.
924752377382604800 2017-10-29 21:38:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @KarenKYteacher @EdanClay Isn't that just awful that so many people know that he would. Scary Times Folks. It may be time to really resist.
924726986416836608 2017-10-29 19:57:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @77CaptainMarvel @ScarletAvengers Yes it's Authoritarian Bluster for sure. This doesn't happen in the US or at least it didn't! Russia, you can have your stooge back.
924725994845548545 2017-10-29 19:53:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @christoq No secret meetings with Russians by everybody or anybody. Russian Mobsters Suck.
924670861210157057 2017-10-29 16:14:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @khwalz @Kimbclay Now that I know what Teapot Dome Scandal is, I'd say this is the Titanic of Teapot Dome Scandals.

924469394796883969 2017-10-28 02:54:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kellyjorgense14 @JoeNBC Yes they most certainly should but they won't. That's so sick. We must go to the streets if this happens.
924447720873570304 2017-10-28 01:28:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @MrGoalie35 "Pro Forced Birth" is NOT PRO LIFE.
924445444884914176 2017-10-28 01:19:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @SamEllison11 @lauferlaw I do not trust Kelly. He has shown us exactly who he is. He is a bad man. He's another Hater.
924443625672597506 2017-10-28 01:11:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @Alyssa_Milano @SamAustin2103 @SeattleJen42 @cap8787 Even then. But it won't. We want the corruption gone, no matter who it is.
924432646259838976 2017-10-28 00:28:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas @amv333 So bazaar his behavior was. What the hell America? We are better than this. If a school principal did this he'd be fired. This is his NORMAL
924431979654926343 2017-10-28 00:25:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas He's not just a pitiful excuse for a president. He's a pitiful excuse for a human being.
924430564601540608 2017-10-28 00:19:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @SamEllison11 @waltshaub So outrageously corrupt. Everybody else has cancelled events. They don't want their names tarnished by Grifter&Chief. Pay4Prison is ok w/it.
924428171352604675 2017-10-28 00:10:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @mikefarb1 @MiraclesArt Completely ridiculous that he's the lead, he's been stalling from day one. Nunes, Grassley & Burr have been pitiful excuses for leaders
924425127034523648 2017-10-28 23:58:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @connorsdale1 Yes, hasn't that been interesting? He went from omnipresent wonder kid to persona non grata. I wonder what changed?
924393898264485888 2017-10-28 21:54:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @RogerJStoneJr @BryanDawsonUSA He's completely unhinged. It would seem he's not looking forward to prison. Roger the Artful Dodger is crapping himself. GOOD WELL DESERVED!
924392871570149376 2017-10-28 21:50:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @RogerJStoneJr @BryanDawsonUSA FINALLY HE'S VICIOUS AND HATEFUL. Now Go the way of Milo.
924343440070053888 2017-10-28 18:33:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @NewtTrump @libertyraven @findley_vickie So that they can give tax cuts to their rich donors. Sorry if you don't like that but it is absolutely 100% true.
924343105800765440 2017-10-28 18:32:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @NewtTrump @libertyraven @findley_vickie Sorry Vickie that is absolutely true. He's a lying cheating money laundering Mobster. Those who support him in Congress know that and lie.
924294298652368896 2017-10-28 15:18:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @NewtTrump @findley_vickie @libertyraven It's impossible to be #MAGA "agenda" & be honest, reliable & independent. The two are mutually exclusive. Perhaps you'll begin to see soon..
924293771772166144 2017-10-28 15:16:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @watzgoinonhere Honest question why do you retweet Louise Mench?

924282375495921666 2017-10-28 14:31:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @bridwise Wish they'd throw in Giuliani for a bonus.
924269390123732992 2017-10-28 13:39:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @WomanMDsGuide @RVAwonk Very clear now. You were early Caroline #RESIST
924268669353517056 2017-10-28 13:36:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes Really wtf? At first I thought he meant Bill's. I hope HRC is out for a brisk walk and laughing about all of this BS.
924266420896194560 2017-10-28 13:27:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @DailyCaller @LauraLeeBordas Sure. Wtf?
924265037996445696 2017-10-28 13:22:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @NewtTrump @findley_vickie @libertyraven And by "loyalists" you mean honest independent members of Congress right? Ryan is a Crook just praying he can screw real Americans w/taxes.
924192994122719232 2017-10-28 08:35:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @SebGorka @Discon1948 Well,we will see.Those of us who recognize what this is must respond and resist should they continue blatant disregard for the Constitution
924191271207481344 2017-10-28 08:29:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @MKRIZSA50 @Lawrence No he has made quite clear what kind of person he is. We must all believe him.
924189032745177088 2017-10-28 08:20:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @SebGorka @Discon1948 Well I've been confident (mostly) but I fear what trump et al may attempt when they truly realize they're caged animals. No Bottom Line Here
924187480747888641 2017-10-28 08:14:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @SebGorka @Discon1948 Sure hope you're right Paul. The Resistance needs a break and so does our Democracy. This may get real ugly real fast.
924123840929783808 2017-10-27 04:01:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @Shakestweetz 100%. I either refer to trump as P Grabber, Pussy Grabber or dumb-dumb. That specifically is why I stopped being friends with my R friends.
924072615945359365 2017-10-27 00:37:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump @Mathimat Racist Propaganda. He's actually only had one wife which is very rare at Faux News. (For what it's worth)
924071787805192192 2017-10-27 00:34:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump Bahahaha what a Dolt. Hannity the Horrible.
923965888415584262 2017-10-27 17:33:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie It's not "Rhetorically Liberal", it's "Rhetorically Rational". #RESIST

923744636870561792 2017-10-26 02:54:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @chelseahandler Bill sounds like he's a little POed at God again. Do you suppose that's the man that's lying about him?
923744010853896193 2017-10-26 02:51:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProgressOutlook Ummm he lies.
923743506635657216 2017-10-26 02:49:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @ScaliaForTrump Yes, his lying iscrepulsive but his dull tool of a mind may be even worse, IMO.

922431576478289920 2017-10-23 11:56:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @sweetnfreee43 Man, that's really sad. Only cult members could believe trump on that one.
922430865854095366 2017-10-23 11:53:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum I'm going with anybody but trump. Seriously, if his mouth is moving, he's lying.
922429275978027010 2017-10-23 11:47:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell It's getting harder & harder because it is the new abnormal. You're absolutely right though, we must resist.
922285319629803520 2017-10-22 02:15:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @BethGoldHux The trump voters I talked to were happy to say who they were voting for and especially who they were voting against.
922284863025229824 2017-10-22 02:13:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @BethGoldHux Yea, that really doesn't make any sense does it.
922282876435140609 2017-10-22 02:05:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr @trumplove63 God how dumb are you? This tax plan does virtually nothing for middle-class. It is great for mega rich though. Cuts Medicaid/Medicare. READ.

922196960874033157 2017-10-22 20:24:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @FriendEden100 @CNN It's true. It is all theatre. It's a poorly produced reality tv show. Press briefings are a total joke. She pitches their crap & deflects.
922193444629549056 2017-10-22 20:10:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Pretty blatant stuff.
922192093405118464 2017-10-22 20:05:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @EricBoehlert It is most definitely a Cult.

921769182492020736 2017-10-21 16:04:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @WilliamKBrown59 Meanwhile, Dear Leader calls it a hoax on a daily basis. Despite saying they believe the IC, who on the Right has really called trump out?
921768686414913536 2017-10-21 16:02:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @WilliamKBrown59 Yes, exactly. Think about it, if you really believed the crazy conspiracy stuff (they do) think what they think about the "Russia" stuff.
921768138215174146 2017-10-21 16:00:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @WilliamKBrown59 @TexanTruth42 Worse, many would never even know she did it because "Real Fake News" would never show it
921765312017682433 2017-10-21 15:49:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @WilliamKBrown59 Maybe to you. This crap will be all over their "Fake News" sources. Info Wars, Breitbart, RT, Faux News, and many will believe it

921740946638819329 2017-10-21 14:12:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump This is so low, even for you Dotard.

921707221842563072 2017-10-21 11:58:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @YerOpinion @tweakyourpc Those people are really just sick. I think they all need to experience a little of what they sow.
921705885382127616 2017-10-21 11:53:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @NathanHRubin @MillenPolitics Yea, Russia is SO much worse than Watergate. It's like 1000 Watergates.
921704896763695104 2017-10-21 11:49:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @mikebarnicle @flaxponder Not all. Look at what he did at Homeland Security, with a damn smile on his face. He's got plenty of evil in him too.

921702809422135296 2017-10-21 11:40:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @martyvidnovic Pretty sure it was the one where "the black lady with the wacky hat" spoke. He obviously heard what he wanted to hear. He's the EMPTY BARREL
921701935274713088 2017-10-21 11:37:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @catmix8 His soul is totally gone. Trump owns it now.
921701560417169408 2017-10-21 11:35:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson That man is really nasty. He's perfect for trump. One evil liar next to the other.
921698009473343489 2017-10-21 11:21:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Just watched a clip of this guy. Talk about Antichrist. These Evangelical nuts are really bad news folks. Truly Godly folks are not haters.

921472694562033665 2017-10-20 20:26:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou It was "warfare" all right. Our government has suffered a coup. All of it brought to us by a masterfully executed high tech attack on truth

921438500393771012 2017-10-20 18:10:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @PrincessBravato @JCTheResistance Their silence on a whole lot of horrible stuff.

921436134705651712 2017-10-20 18:01:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @NikkiNikkinow2 I find the level of depravity at which these people operate very disturbing.It seems they've declared war and we're loosing. We must be woke

921432319977717760 2017-10-20 17:45:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @NikkiNikkinow2 I'm also suspicious of "Antifa". They mysteriously show up at high profile stuff & act a fool. So head Mobster can say "on both sides".
921431112811012097 2017-10-20 17:41:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @NikkiNikkinow2 Everything is a darn "thing". It wouldn't surprise me at all if this Band of Mobsters in the WH are running their own Op at this point.
921430325506596864 2017-10-20 17:38:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @NikkiNikkinow2 Oh lol. "Identifiable" is very important there. They've been at this for awhile. We are at least two steps behind. Sorry to say. #RESIST
921429417532026880 2017-10-20 17:34:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @NikkiNikkinow2 I'm NOT surprised that it happens at all. Women in general are being targeted. I just question who's REALLY  doing it.

921428484488093697 2017-10-20 17:30:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @NikkiNikkinow2 I've NEVER heard an actual Dem say/do awful stuff like that. "Divide & Conquer" is their MO. It's a Putin KGB thing weaponized here. GROSS.
921427457936445440 2017-10-20 17:26:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @NikkiNikkinow2 So Sorry to hear that but that sounds like Alt-Right/Russian crap to me. If they're not spreading Conspiracy crap they're dividing groups.
921426670636150785 2017-10-20 17:23:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @EdKrassen @srhollisann @donewithorange @Michgriff6619 Wait for it.... over/under on how long that tidbit will take to come out.
921426300962828291 2017-10-20 17:22:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @EdKrassen It's beginning to look that way.
921425725227520000 2017-10-20 17:19:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @NikkiNikkinow2 "Alt-left"?
921424558191710209 2017-10-20 17:15:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @NikkiNikkinow2 Perhaps not but it's mostly Republicans, it's the one thing trump has actually delivered on. It's horrible, as I'm sure you know.
921420581588828160 2017-10-20 16:59:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @shoreboy1961 @tonyschwartz Just like Goebbels knew it. It's evil really and devastating to our country.
921419456546508801 2017-10-20 16:54:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton Sir, it's imperative that someone stand up for Congress. Wilson's honor. As a Vet, I think you should be the one. Please help.
921417929119453184 2017-10-20 16:48:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @C3Twitty @Amy_Siskind These people are completely out of control. They must be stopped. Each day another fiber is pulled from the cloth of this country.
921417009618915329 2017-10-20 16:45:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @The_UnSilent_ Never a truer word spoken.
921412153206288385 2017-10-20 16:25:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @jbendery @mattyglesias @stashuk78 Meant to say "RepubliKlan"
921411988391067649 2017-10-20 16:25:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @jbendery @mattyglesias @stashuk78 Sad but true. "The Republican trifecta of inferior"
921411555039772672 2017-10-20 16:23:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias I think you meant to say, "sense of decency".
921397005196386305 2017-10-20 15:25:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyraDSirois1 @JoyAnnReid SOS.
921384311047286785 2017-10-20 14:35:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @HuffPost @azpux Of course I meant stupor! I think his eyes look completely dead.
921372042863218688 2017-10-20 13:46:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump Really by comparison he looks pretty good. Guess he deserves that.
921368471824420864 2017-10-20 13:32:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @jackiecall3 @NBCNews No way!
921367479389102080 2017-10-20 13:28:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @HuffPost His eyes are so creepy. Always looks like he's in a stopper.
921365992923631616 2017-10-20 13:22:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @EndtheHIT Stop promoting this BS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
921365709967581189 2017-10-20 13:21:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @vet2980 Probably not just Russian. Pretty sure trump is an equal opportunity money launderer.
921364994448658432 2017-10-20 13:18:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior What's this about Sarah? Who lifted your quote?
921363794324066305 2017-10-20 13:13:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @holly_hodkinson Kelly's husband has made a lot of $$$. He's an attorney as well 
921363410989862912 2017-10-20 13:12:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @Graing18 That's the one! I actually liked the suit, the bad hat and purse ruined it. Also, red is not her color.
921362645835501568 2017-10-20 13:09:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @shoreboy1961 @RWPUSA Gucci on the outside, garbage on the inside. High class whores are still whores.
921361463717122048 2017-10-20 13:04:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @Bonniescott1964 @OneVoiceinPA I'm so tired of it. Also, I'm very tired of Dems not speaking out about it.
921361054529179648 2017-10-20 13:02:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @OneVoiceinPA "Swinging"
921360834361741312 2017-10-20 13:01:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @Jodi5ft15 @Bonniescott1964 For years.
921360696184590336 2017-10-20 13:01:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @Elviraafterthot @thehill His bio will be called "what happened when Cons elected a Russian Mobster as president"
921360162308452352 2017-10-20 12:59:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @maddow @PassarelliAllan @sweetnonnie Yea why do I smell an Eric Prince turd in there too?
921359662720667649 2017-10-20 12:57:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @JayWeber3 @SykesCharlie @RacerX57217102 @MilwSpinny Steve, your grammar leaves a little to be desired.
921358092893392902 2017-10-20 12:51:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Cineflex @FOXTV @DavidAlanArnold No, they've single handedly done more to destroy our Democracy than any other "News" agency in US history. And they brought us Dotard trump.
921355455535992833 2017-10-20 12:40:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @Cineflex @FOXTV @DavidAlanArnold Fox does not deserve to show the flag.
921355332571549697 2017-10-20 12:40:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @Cineflex @FOXTV @DavidAlanArnold Barf.
921353829983059968 2017-10-20 12:34:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump IDIOT.
921353477011406848 2017-10-20 12:32:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump By "people" you mean my fellow 1%. GROSS. We see you GOP, we see you.
921352510308339712 2017-10-20 12:28:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @PhilipRucker @memwc "Probably in about two weeks"
921352301922615296 2017-10-20 12:28:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @AdavisWilliams @PhilipRucker This White House couldn't handle an announced fire drill.
921350079822299136 2017-10-20 12:19:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @raggapegs No, he whored out Gen Kelly for that purpose obviously.
921344945272877056 2017-10-20 11:58:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepWilson @nadinevdVelde @JoyAnnReid Full Stop.
921344547552194562 2017-10-20 11:57:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Total bull! I'm not sure which is worse. Is it that they want to "help" the Ultra rich or the fact that they think we're too dumb to know?
921223188863795205 2017-10-19 03:54:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Nice Ad for your boy Dotard.

921220913244393472 2017-10-19 03:45:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT Not this Dem.
921210247125131266 2017-10-19 03:03:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @olgaNYC1211 He is.
921206557974687744 2017-10-19 02:48:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny The Dems were not in charge of voter suppression, that's always a Con thing.
921205396639027200 2017-10-19 02:44:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @MilwSpinny Charlie on Lawrence O'Donnell right now.
921204473606934528 2017-10-19 02:40:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @MilwSpinny Anybody who's paying attention knows that Voter Suppression is big in WI. No surprise, land of Ryan & Walker (2 total snakes)
921203107840880641 2017-10-19 02:35:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @resisterhood @chrislhayes @JessicaPMorrell @reesetheone1 This white woman totally agrees. Voting for the P grabber unacceptable!
921202207952957441 2017-10-19 02:31:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @tenax666 Yea, he's consumed the darn kool aid. Just doing his job like a good soldier.
921200913808855041 2017-10-19 02:26:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny Money talks Steve, you seem to know that.
921200012897505280 2017-10-19 02:22:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @MilwSpinny @starkers_tweets Ummm no, WI down 45,000 voters in 2016.
921196042179174400 2017-10-19 02:07:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny Why was voter turn out in 2016 lower in WI than it's been in 2 decades. WI a leader in voter suppression & jerrymandering. You must be proud
921193844158488578 2017-10-19 01:58:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny Look at the Cons behavior since election. Deplorable doesn't begin to do them justice. They're amoral trolls who have sold their souls.
921193137233711106 2017-10-19 01:55:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny Widely reported that McConnell played dirty pool, no surprise there, look at Gorsuch, 8 years of obstruction.
921192564753125379 2017-10-19 01:53:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny In good time detective, in good time. He's the former head of the CIA, hardly a Bloviating hack. That would be Pompeo obviously.
921189994617884673 2017-10-19 01:43:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny You do know that "entertainment" and not "news". (Their word, not mine)
921189484745633793 2017-10-19 01:41:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @starkers_tweets @MilwSpinny Oh you watch Fox? Now there's a shocker!!!
921189192666963968 2017-10-19 01:39:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny Former homicide detective-wow. You don't want proof. Mueller is on it. Cons trying to kill investigation.pic.twitter.com/RW4ggrixyg
921184499328782337 2017-10-19 01:21:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny @starkers_tweets Yea Rachel would never have Charlie on her show (sorry Charlie).
921179725615321088 2017-10-19 01:02:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny Wow now that IS pretty damning.
921177945577807872 2017-10-19 00:55:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny And???
921177700299132928 2017-10-19 00:54:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @starkers_tweets @MilwSpinny @SykesCharlie Pretty sure that's the cardinal sin of not supporting a totally incompetent Bigot bc he managed to steal the presidency with Putin's help
921175557970198533 2017-10-19 00:45:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @starkers_tweets @MilwSpinny Funny answer.  I just find it interesting that Cons find it so liberal or something and I really don't at all. Much is totally apolitical
921174185229144064 2017-10-19 00:40:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @starkers_tweets @MilwSpinny Really Steve, have you ever listened to NPR?

921156184400433152 2017-10-19 23:28:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato For Sure.
921155698834145280 2017-10-19 23:26:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @euchreman1022 @STrimel Yea, women were "sacred" when they were stuck at home, barefoot and pregnant. Kelly is not going to save us, that's for sure.
921154162938777600 2017-10-19 23:20:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @yashar @Paul_VanDerMeer "It's just disgraceful that our Dear Leader has to bother with these calls"
921153583646695425 2017-10-19 23:18:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @yashar I mean who in their right mind would think trump would be good at this? "Your market value will now go up because I called you"
921152871198023682 2017-10-19 23:15:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @PressSec @GOPChairwoman Ronna you need a brain transplant. She's a pathological liar for God's sake.
921149118503903232 2017-10-19 23:00:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @HunterFallacy Thanks for sharing. I wasn't aware he was quite that bad. No wonder he'd work for trump. Maybe he needs some "rectal feeding"

921137593395372032 2017-10-19 22:14:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenGillibrand @saradani @SeekerofTruth0 Gee never would have guessed you're (your) a trump supporter.
921137163256979456 2017-10-19 22:13:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @SenGillibrand Well half of you are serving the Donor Class of the 1%.
921133970481442816 2017-10-19 22:00:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Admirable for him to admit.
921131203364868097 2017-10-19 21:49:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnFugelsang So true. It's so universal it's scary!
921130650190712833 2017-10-19 21:47:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @therealroseanne Wait you're a Repug? Gross!
921130209767763968 2017-10-19 21:45:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @Amy_Siskind He literally made a deal with the devil. That is now completely clear.
921129966485540865 2017-10-19 21:44:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarchForTruth17 He's so gross. I don't trust him at all.
921129375168368640 2017-10-19 21:42:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @BBellavigna @JoyAnnReid Tragic. But really, if he were really better than this he would not work for trump.
921125180226891776 2017-10-19 21:25:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheBeatWithAri @JillWineBanks Go Jill!!! "I know I could"
921124199929872384 2017-10-19 21:21:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT They're despicable. Hard to make healthcare bill that nets a lot of cash for tax cut to the rich!
921123618259599360 2017-10-19 21:19:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @DarrellIssa @MikeLevinCA He's a total grease ball. Sure hope you beat his low class ass.
921123107468914688 2017-10-19 21:17:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @MilwSpinny Man, I'll bet you were one dirty cop. Ever shoot any unarmed Black guys?
921114228555223042 2017-10-19 20:42:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger Thanks to Dumb dumb, we have a very low bar these days.

921078913648025600 2017-10-19 18:21:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @jenhab Wow a couple surprises. Thank you Senators for putting people before party!
921075040069865472 2017-10-19 18:06:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOPChairwoman Gross, so very gross Ronna. How could you support such an evil hating fake Christian?
921074728529551361 2017-10-19 18:05:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven @ChrisMurphyCT "Details" Senator details. Talk is cheap.
921074445514616832 2017-10-19 18:03:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @girlsreallyrule Awesome!
921069118941532162 2017-10-19 17:42:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @MilwSpinny @SykesCharlie You seem like a good man and these days that's a disqualifier for the Republican party. You know what Ryan and Walker are & not the worst.
921068121863188481 2017-10-19 17:38:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @MilwSpinny @SykesCharlie What keeps you a "conservative"?
921039137981034497 2017-10-19 15:43:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @shoreboy1961 @TheRickyDavila Tides are a turnin.
921037462595620864 2017-10-19 15:36:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @RogerPicardUSA @Amy_Siskind Heartbreaking is what it is.

921026730617323520 2017-10-19 14:54:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie Yes Charlie all of the above. There are very few of you left you know. Ethical republicans are all but extinct now. Thanks Faux News.
921002693736484864 2017-10-19 13:18:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @spokanetom @AmandiOnAir I accepted that before he got elected. What I'm having a harder time accepting is how everybody doesn't see this as obvious.
920992678279557120 2017-10-19 12:39:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyWchu I totally agree.
920992076828958720 2017-10-19 12:36:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @btach2014 @ShannonSharpe Ain't no such thing as a "traffic stop" for a black man in the good ole US of A. Take a Knee.
920986896486019072 2017-10-19 12:16:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProudResister It's Repulsive. Notice he chose the Black family to disrespect. He's such a racist. He makes me sick!
920986043536601089 2017-10-19 12:12:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillCassidy You're a weasely little sucker. Couldn't even admit that trump was inhumane to Gold Star family. In the end, you will pay.
920978034047508481 2017-10-19 11:40:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba NO. Trickle down is just a scam to reduce taxes to the ultra rich. That's what it has always been.
920977543204888576 2017-10-19 11:38:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrhmp @TalbertSwan @ShippenJR Said only trump white racist base. Shut up you hater. You elected this Dotard. Enjoy it while it lasts.
920977121824174080 2017-10-19 11:37:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrhmp @TalbertSwan So True Bishop. It's first on his mind everyday. That and his envy of HRC.
920976192982978560 2017-10-19 11:33:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump LOSER MAN, YOU ARE OFF YOUR NUT!
920975792556969985 2017-10-19 11:31:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Gee, when do you get unpresidented?

920808810905681920 2017-10-18 00:28:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNNPolitics @FurForceFive Dems need to boycott that crap. "Sorry we're too busy"
920796679657287681 2017-10-18 23:40:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol But you know they will. Why, because they have ZERO integrity.
920796460857171969 2017-10-18 23:39:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol Well after trump what does it really matter? Bill,80% of Dem candidates would be better than Repub choice. Dems are smarter & less dishonest
920765283706572800 2017-10-18 21:35:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @SteveKingIA You're so gross.
920765077292290048 2017-10-18 21:34:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven @jaketapper Bahahaha perfect answer. What these people tweet really does confirm how stupid they really are. Talk about teeing it up for somebody!!!
920699816937746435 2017-10-18 17:15:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Helenhs Also when he opens his mouth, he's lying.
920663193286004736 2017-10-18 14:49:45 UTC <HenslerKate> Good lord Sessions is turning into a little red devil right before our eyes.
920662216868814854 2017-10-18 14:45:52 UTC <HenslerKate> Grassley are you f ing kidding me? What a bunch of crooks these people are.

920653715719311362 2017-10-18 14:12:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Yes Joe, totally predictable. And yet, it wasn't too long ago that you backed that idiot. Hmmm, what's that say about you?
920652931552239616 2017-10-18 14:08:58 UTC <HenslerKate> Grassley may be confused about "homo" cides.
920652589972312065 2017-10-18 14:07:37 UTC <HenslerKate> Woa evil elf Sessions is looking pretty rough this am. Tough night Jeffrey?
920638370900074496 2017-10-18 13:11:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @letahamilton383 @FlaDems Wow I'm so not surprised. Can they get AG Bondi to look into that?
920636700317110274 2017-10-18 13:04:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @SherakMartin Narcissists don't think normally. He'd just keep telling the lie. It's very hard to deal with. Facts truly don't matter.
920635838039560192 2017-10-18 13:01:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @B52Malmet @tribelaw No,it wouldn't surprise me one little bit. I accepted he has no bottom line quite awhile ago. Pussy grabbing is the rule, not the exception
920634567500992513 2017-10-18 12:56:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnOSullivan36 @KenDilanianNBC Yea, that's when it was totally clear how totally incompetent they were. A five year old would hAve known better.
920626194315440128 2017-10-18 12:22:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @NewDay @SenatorCollins @ChrisCuomo @ananavarro Yea she seems much more like a Dem than a RepubliKlan.
920624845536288768 2017-10-18 12:17:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs I've pretty much been ignoring for awhile. It's all just bs anyway. It's all part of his worthless plan to distract from his crimes.
920622507698335744 2017-10-18 12:08:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Not looking away. We don't care about your fake football patriotism. You don't have even have respect for fallen soldiers. Stop Deflecting.
920605420468785152 2017-10-18 11:00:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Fuctupmind Yea Trey Gowdy is really very scary. Very scary. That's a very shallow gene pool for sure.
920602541515313152 2017-10-18 10:48:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @DelayKathleen @ThePlumLineGS Yea I'm over that. He's a one trick pony and he's used it WAY too many times. His abuse of Gen Kelly is disgusting & unforgivable.
920601202605346817 2017-10-18 10:43:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs Yes I cried too (I'm not a cryer) watching that poor young mom & hearing Rep Wilson share the story was just heartbreaking. #RESIST
920502002790133761 2017-10-17 04:09:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @MrGoalie35 @davidaxelrod Completely disgraceful.

920488998082105350 2017-10-17 03:17:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @spokanetom @CharlesMBlow No, it's a bottomless pit of damn Deplorable, just like she said.

920358686878511104 2017-10-17 18:39:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol @dane_hedquist @jerweber @vinniemgupta He allowed Hobby Lobby to deny women birth control based on religion. What else do you need to know. He's pro big business, anti little man.
920358117073973249 2017-10-17 18:37:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol Bill and you seem quite rational. You lost me at Gorsuch.

920344876922953728 2017-10-17 17:44:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @alicetweet @neelzz19 Alice is a fake Christian who has worked for a lot of Fake Christians. She is far from innocent.pic.twitter.com/8xZiq18qlg
920343680120229889 2017-10-17 17:40:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @alicetweet @neelzz19 Sweet Kellyanne Conway also shilled for Cruz. Had Alice been asked,Alice would be in the WH right now. You reap what you sow. It's a pattern
920342920821166082 2017-10-17 17:37:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @alicetweet @neelzz19 You're sweet. She also shilled for Huckabee, Santorum, and wait for it, Bachmann. The very poster people for lying fake Christians.
920334416634875904 2017-10-17 17:03:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezraklein He's not burdened by normal human emotion.
920332565600448512 2017-10-17 16:55:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @neelzz19 @alicetweet Evil Bannon just said no Repubs are safe except for Cruz, hmmm I wonder why that is? Care to "enlighten us"?
920330840705503233 2017-10-17 16:49:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @neelzz19 @alicetweet When a fellow Repub Senator says if Cruz got shot, no one would help him, you know the man is a snake. Cruz is among the worst. That's BAD!
920329950321954817 2017-10-17 16:45:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @neelzz19 @alicetweet You backed Ted Cruz. If you see no moral hypocrisy or innate dishonesty in that then you're beyond enlightenment. You do always look nice!

920314879852122112 2017-10-17 15:45:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @alicetweet @neelzz19 Yea except for that she worked for Cruz, so there's that .
920314683692847107 2017-10-17 15:44:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericbeachgop @CillizzaCNN @niaCNN @KateBolduan @alicetweet I've met mcconnell nowhere. He wouldn't dare show his face in public. Neither would Cruz for that matter. You're gross.
920312290787954693 2017-10-17 15:35:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @IvankaTrump @PressSec @IsaacDovere If she didn't have the same last name, we'd have no idea who she is.

920305876606554113 2017-10-17 15:09:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @ScottDStone2020 But then it would diminish the desired effect.
920304126952656896 2017-10-17 15:02:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @dandrezner Yes, that's exactly what he'll do because he's really that small of a human being.
920303773985267712 2017-10-17 15:01:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @KitterleCathy @Brasilmagic Wrong on every level. Evil elf man must go along with other Russian plants.

920295936173240321 2017-10-17 14:30:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @JillWineBanks Now Jill, you know this. Trump is a world class crook. He chooses crooks. Pretty simple.

919886683834904576 2017-10-16 11:24:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @Auti1975 Is compromised.
919886162264719360 2017-10-16 11:22:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul I've been there for awhile. They've been trumped Michael. It's what happens.
919883622836068352 2017-10-16 11:12:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii Yea, you're really gross. I heard enough to know that a long time ago.
919882201789026304 2017-10-16 11:06:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul Hmmm, maybe they don't deserve your respect.
919732797572550656 2017-10-15 01:12:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Yes it was. They have no class what do ever.

919418703443365888 2017-10-14 04:24:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @ClarenceMack3 @craig_steger Bye!!!
919418615664988160 2017-10-14 04:24:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepScottPerry You looked like a real dolt talking to Cuomo. Shameful.
919413281521061888 2017-10-14 04:03:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @craig_steger Did you vote? For whom?
919412381729648640 2017-10-14 03:59:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @BernieSanders @keithellison @TomPerez @BethGoldHux @vanadiumzest Yes I'm very tired of it. In my opinion, if he wants any voice at all, he can start by joining the party for pete's sake!
919411176001417216 2017-10-14 03:54:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @craig_steger You're either a bot or a nut. I don't like either of those.
919410785247481861 2017-10-14 03:53:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @craig_steger You didn't have to say it. Pro liberty bs says it all. Funny because trump clearly has Authoritarian tendencies. So much for liberty.
919408837848911872 2017-10-14 03:45:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @craig_steger No
919408602456129536 2017-10-14 03:44:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @craig_steger "Pro liberty" trump supporter? Vkearly you mean Russian liberty. Gross.
919408295286329344 2017-10-14 03:43:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @craig_steger I think it is bull. Wikilinks is Russian Allie. I blame the racist Faux Christians who supported a pussy grabber and ignored clear collusion
919407220789596160 2017-10-14 03:38:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @craig_steger No this is bullpic.twitter.com/B18oAg9fHU

919403944492888064 2017-10-14 03:25:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @craig_steger What are you talking about?The stupid republicans deserve the blame for nominating a Russian Mobster they knew was a total crook.They'll pay
919403492715958273 2017-10-14 03:24:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @ClarenceMack3 @craig_steger Not if Russia/Putin is 3rd party.
919369286283644928 2017-10-14 01:08:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @craig_steger Craig you post worthless stuff. Not wasting time on you, if you want to know then read something real (if that's available on homestead)
919365389041070081 2017-10-14 00:52:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @craig_steger Wrong, Russia is the reason she lost the election
919346036887490560 2017-10-14 23:35:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @GailRNJD @RWPUSA Shoe fits
919340352418574336 2017-10-14 23:13:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdWGillespie @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence NOT.
919340135405191170 2017-10-14 23:12:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @LaraLeaTrump @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump Omg just how bloody low will you go? Apparently, to the very bottom.
919339594205802498 2017-10-14 23:10:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You are a pathological. People get less coverage for more money. Dotard trump strikes again.
919338782968729600 2017-10-14 23:07:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @PoliticusSarah @amv333 Never ending episode. I refuse to accept that this can continue forever. Each day, it's a bit worse.
919332884258926592 2017-10-14 22:43:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @PoliticusSarah I'm totally aware. They are without conscience.
919237859193782273 2017-10-14 16:25:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @dawnresist @perlmutations Bring it on, they own it all right!!!
919237275963285504 2017-10-14 16:23:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind He is a True Hater to his core.
919236473458708482 2017-10-14 16:20:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @IvankaTrump @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @theminnguy @freepressfree @Eykis @Karfrmthhrt Which she never meant and never pushed. Just more grifter BS.
919236089713446913 2017-10-14 16:18:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Hmmm kind of like Working for Ailes? So then you obviously have insight into that! Idiot!
919235405739888640 2017-10-14 16:16:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA @jackiecall3 Yea sounds a lot more like Daryl!

918686122401611776 2017-10-12 03:53:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Agreed
918615978803712000 2017-10-12 23:14:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @KuntrinaPierson They certainly all deserve that Save maybe 4 of them. SAD.
918612379704942593 2017-10-12 23:00:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @mattmfm Details.
918556497843490816 2017-10-12 19:18:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @vavrek_james @Angcat123 Took him much longer to get help down there,wouldn't lift Jones Act until forced, didn't get US Confirt there until late. Doesn't like brown
918507126540128257 2017-10-12 16:02:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mikel_Jollett Sick.
918503518025191424 2017-10-12 15:47:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobinBrenizer The media was definitely part of it but so was Putin. Let's not forget that!
918495408900464640 2017-10-12 15:15:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @JenAshleyWright Let me just say I'm flipping tired of Bernie. He does not represent me.
918490998631747584 2017-10-12 14:58:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mikel_Jollett This is so wrong!!!
918488072349782017 2017-10-12 14:46:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @samswey They should lock up that hateful cracker.
918456514939113474 2017-10-12 12:41:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @sedefelice @AngrierWHStaff No doubt about it The difference in his mental acuity during the campaign and now is striking.I really wonder if he's on some serious meds.
918453763786137603 2017-10-12 12:30:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @tonyschwartz Yes true in Kentucky as well.

918453190227644417 2017-10-12 12:27:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @tonyschwartz AKA REPUBLIKLANS.
918452153760538625 2017-10-12 12:23:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @boyscouts @realBigBalls I thought exactly the same thing. NO WAY.
918451074285043712 2017-10-12 12:19:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bourdain Bahahaha so true. "Your" funny.
918450171251486720 2017-10-12 12:15:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @wmfd2007 The know the mfers know they just want their disgusting tax cut and their donors will stop paying them if they don't.
918449835086368768 2017-10-12 12:14:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw The time has come folks, we must act before Dotard does and it's too late. Let's do this.
918449352036712448 2017-10-12 12:12:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @EdanClay RIGHT.
918448591873732608 2017-10-12 12:09:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix @GeekTrader Look at how terribly wrong this is. We are in trouble for sure.
918446699542085632 2017-10-12 12:02:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones You mean Jeffrey B. Sessions had no real solution. I'm shocked he's usually so good at law and order.
918446067779362816 2017-10-12 11:59:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @RogueCPI @grantstern @AynRandPaulRyan Oh my. We must act.
918445062375211008 2017-10-12 11:55:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @koller_duncan @AmandiOnAir @elise_pearlie It's on them but they won't do the right thing so we must. Once we start war, it won't matter.
918444684640432129 2017-10-12 11:54:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AmandiOnAir @oufenix Totally with you!
918444534811496448 2017-10-12 11:53:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @grantstern @AmandiOnAir I could not agree more. We must act before we're at war for no reason other than keeping this fool in office.
918443674442313729 2017-10-12 11:50:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @ray_gull It's sick, he's such a f***ing racist. He must be stopped.
918442896596127744 2017-10-12 11:47:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AliCologne @45MUSTGO Could be or he just is very narcissistic & senile. His mind is not right, that's for sure. We're in serious trouble.
918442101871869952 2017-10-12 11:43:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump EVIL.
918442044154097665 2017-10-12 11:43:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump INHUMANE.
918441926625505280 2017-10-12 11:43:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump CRUEL.
918441782517608449 2017-10-12 11:42:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Barf.
918440205123772416 2017-10-12 11:36:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @farronbalanced @mshopemac @ringoffireradio Indeed, he's not worthy.
918301381433454594 2017-10-11 02:24:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul Oh please Michael, who are trying to kid. We slip down every darn day.
918292388841484288 2017-10-11 01:49:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila Oh for god's sake.
918249382482448384 2017-10-11 22:58:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @FocusOnQuality @washingtonpost Yes we need him so badly. Welcome back to a real President!
918248413908652032 2017-10-11 22:54:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaryAbrahams @BarbraStreisand Really such hypocrisy.
918244751211720704 2017-10-11 22:39:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @jackiecall3 @ProudResister By Hannity, dream on Resister.
918230720224653312 2017-10-11 21:43:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepDaveBrat You looked like a fool on MSNBC. "Yea, you bet" Virginia deserves so much better!
918217583068958720 2017-10-11 20:51:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump "Awarding" omg the reality show hype is so repulsive.
918180778693062656 2017-10-11 18:25:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @amovicky1 Take Fox off, it's not mainstream media
918179229417791490 2017-10-11 18:19:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RobertWeinber16 @SenBobCasey And he'll be lying every step of the way.
918174766015578113 2017-10-11 18:01:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @alroker @SavannahGuthrie @KathieLGifford @hodakotb @nbc @MSNBC @TODAYshow @CNN @megynkelly @mitchellreports @MaryKeithBare1 @Pie_SocialMedia Yes she's a deal breaker for me too!
918173771026042881 2017-10-11 17:57:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 My God he's so so so bad. Alabama, surely you're better than this guy, right?
918159040680775681 2017-10-11 16:59:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @RalstonReports THIS IS SO WRONG.
918158570100805634 2017-10-11 16:57:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance @peterdaou I can only imagine what that mouth is capable of doing and saying. He's gross & he was a chief advisor to POTUS. Wtf America?
918152699350323201 2017-10-11 16:33:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @kayleighmcenany @snowflake_miner @Dedave41 So tired of hearing people say "the people elected him". That is false-FAKE NEWS!!!
918129514856828928 2017-10-11 15:01:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @NBCPolitics @JRubinBlogger That ship has sailed Jennifer. It's time for the few of you Cons with any integrity at all to walk. They've sold their souls to devil trump.
918121749602013184 2017-10-11 14:30:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @B52Malmet Yea I like it too. It's says what it needs to say!
918121163754221568 2017-10-11 14:28:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @shoreboy1961 Lol not surprising based on her comments. I almost can't take the haters & liars any more. They're so selfish it's repulsive.
918120632667262976 2017-10-11 14:26:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @ladiesgun You know it's really bad when this is a Fox guy. We need to take a stand.
918118289829752834 2017-10-11 14:17:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrianKarem Brian it's time for you to call Sarah out on her lying and attacking, PLEASE.
918117594640670721 2017-10-11 14:14:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle It's past time to challenge trump's license. He's a Con and a fraud and he's killing our county one hateful destructive tweet at a time.
918116778512875520 2017-10-11 14:11:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @SimonBobbette did you start a new account?
918112744678838272 2017-10-11 13:55:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro Yea, I don't know who she is but I know I don't like her.
918108843875422209 2017-10-11 13:39:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaryAbrahams Yea no difference. Dems at least try, repugs, not so much!
918106639919734784 2017-10-11 13:30:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @Pie_SocialMedia @NattyBumppo5 Take that redneck hater down. He's vile, just like trump!
918106143389638656 2017-10-11 13:28:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @realBigBalls I think that's a shitty false statement. Women get shamed for this stuff. "Poor Angelina feeling sorry for her beautiful self". No proof.
918104278291673088 2017-10-11 13:21:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence @CharlieCookDC @AriMelber Shhhhh just let them burn it down.
918102802253131776 2017-10-11 13:15:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 They must step it up, they've been far too complacent about this. Rump is going to get Americans killed for nothing.
918100227445460992 2017-10-11 13:05:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @BuildStrength @kathleendawe @Vetpilot5k Pave you're not too swift are you?
918099924486639616 2017-10-11 13:04:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @BuildStrength @kathleendawe You need help, you're not rational.
918099265104334853 2017-10-11 13:01:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @BuildStrength Is this an actual Ad? You people need your heads examined!
918096414118416386 2017-10-11 12:50:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @Eat_Shop_Travel @onahunttoday Then why the F don't they "agree" with Corker? They are CROOKS.
918096155556352001 2017-10-11 12:49:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Nor has one stood up and agreed and that's even worse.
918094302349283328 2017-10-11 12:41:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @polyestercarrot No, he's a narcissist. He thinks he'll never die. He figures he's safe and everyone else is expendable. It's part of the pathology.
918091640065134595 2017-10-11 12:31:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @nycsouthpaw @MrRobotCodeBrkr Crickets on that, I'm sure.
918088586955718657 2017-10-11 12:19:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Oh God, save us.
918086704984182785 2017-10-11 12:11:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 No, you just thought he was. You are wrong.
917888448677195776 2017-10-10 23:03:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @mshopemac @Michael_Eisner Sure nobody knew about trump either. Save It!
917884178804494337 2017-10-10 22:46:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @DNC @GOP @alaskarebel @The_UnSilent_ Rexon doesn't strike me as particularly bright either, for the record!
917884011153903616 2017-10-10 22:46:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @DNC @GOP @alaskarebel @The_UnSilent_ This is NOT a surprise at all!
917882980487581696 2017-10-10 22:42:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @laurenduca Omg I've heard it all. That 52% should not be allowed to vote! We all know who they voted for now don't we!
917881445577871360 2017-10-10 22:36:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @chicagotribune @wilytone Thanks!
917881267756191744 2017-10-10 22:35:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @Publia1920 @kurteichenwald Woa never heard that one!
917881087031947264 2017-10-10 22:34:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @kurteichenwald I think we should all say that "many people are saying he's an idiot". He must produce an IQ test to prove that he's not! Idiotism is born!
917862311473192960 2017-10-10 21:20:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindaWildes Bahahaha me too!

917851937386778625 2017-10-10 20:38:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @WomanMDsGuide @zellieimani What a joke. What a sick double standard joke. Had he been Black, assassination.
917850406239260672 2017-10-10 20:32:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer What a total snake he is.
917850057021542400 2017-10-10 20:31:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @chicagotribune @wilytone Oh I know, I'm not excusing his awful comment. It should have come with  sorry (although he def looks like a former football player)
917836025560526848 2017-10-10 19:35:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @wilytone @chicagotribune What an ASS! CTE?
917780500386852865 2017-10-10 15:54:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump This is so beneath the office you hold. You're a scam artist and Americans are tired of your tawdry scam.
917758456991494145 2017-10-10 14:27:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @DineshDSouza @Sethrogen @kurteichenwald He's awful

917724448349974528 2017-10-10 12:12:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @brhodes @BethellMarilyn Funny you think Obama had a "criminal presidency" and yet trump & co are the criminals who are actually under criminal investigation. TRUTH!
917541204455231488 2017-10-09 00:04:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @brhodes @joanier52 @TheEmperorJahi @CubanLady4Trump I would NEVER trust someone who called herself, Deplorable. NEVER.

917539843386806277 2017-10-09 23:58:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @Varidienne @brhodes Yes, pretty ironic. Not to mention. Him talking about how #44 played golf all the time. Meanwhile, he's spent 20% of his time playing golf.
917538102159314944 2017-10-09 23:51:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @lockedmith @JuddLegum Their behavior is indefensible. There is no justifying that.
917537447050993664 2017-10-09 23:49:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @boyndog Yes I haven't a doubt. I really do believe that narcissists believe their own lies.
917533272334364673 2017-10-09 23:32:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 Which is why I marched in women's march. She wasn't wrong!
917532360010235905 2017-10-09 23:28:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @VP @HardballChris @ericbeachgop @mosttrustedguy Like a robot. "That's a good and simple question" that I can't begin to answer. Bahahaha so transparent.
917532001418309633 2017-10-09 23:27:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @VP @HardballChris @ericbeachgop You don't have enough honor to take a knee Eric. You'd better stay away from trump as he might try and grab you!!!
917531035830816768 2017-10-09 23:23:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @K_JeanPierre @tswarens @hardball You looked like an ASS on Hardball. You sounded like an idiot robot! Get a brain!!!

917503838420131840 2017-10-09 21:35:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC You Lindsey are a traitor to your country. When the shit hits the fan you will be in direct line of Fire & people will not forget.
917502795372269569 2017-10-09 21:31:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Rosie Yes Rosie! Women need to March on D.C. (And bring their supportive men) It's out of control. The Cons clearly can not be trusted! March Now.
917499902825058306 2017-10-09 21:19:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @VoteMarsha @KeithOlbermann God she makes me positively nauseas. She lies incessantly in that obnoxious whinny voice.
917477765791801346 2017-10-09 19:51:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag @BillKristol No kidding! It's not like it wasn't obvious.
917431692813586438 2017-10-09 16:48:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @VP You are a fraud.
917419253636182016 2017-10-09 15:59:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @Brandon_Bird Did u get in twitter trouble for this? Posted very similar statement yesterday and I did.
917408437885161474 2017-10-09 15:16:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bakari_Sellers Idiots rule our country.
917347289810825217 2017-10-09 11:13:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland What? What happened to the 100,000.00$$ they supposedly spent?
917254918385405953 2017-10-08 05:06:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnWDean Perfect!
917246130311892992 2017-10-08 04:31:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanspicer @AlmaForte2 @JoyAnnReid So true Joy!

917226735317540864 2017-10-08 03:14:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Does this mean you've finally defected?
917222747733987328 2017-10-08 02:58:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @Remy_Anne @BCunningham215 How sick is that?
917222268807335936 2017-10-08 02:56:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @DineshDSouza Key word there, "were"!
917221476637532160 2017-10-08 02:53:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk Man that's really sick. More elevated GOP influence on Michigan? Did darling DeVos get to weigh in on this. She would approve, no doubt.
917185770909323265 2017-10-08 00:31:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @nypost @realDonaldTrump @UnkleNeal I really thought it was a parody account. Really low, even for Dotard.
917184456036962304 2017-10-08 00:26:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @nypost @realDonaldTrump Dotard trump is true trash.
917183708440006657 2017-10-08 00:23:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @NiravaSara @sirDukeDevin Well, one would think!

917176536310124545 2017-10-08 23:55:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr @FunkyVisions Bahahaha good one!
917174169405714433 2017-10-08 23:45:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @AriMelber Honestly, any more I just assume it's a lie. I would never vote for Corker but it's clear which man has more integrity.

917166865050370048 2017-10-08 23:16:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @shoreboy1961 @KevinMKruse And Gold Star families? Shameful people.
917165386180775937 2017-10-08 23:10:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @mommacat35 @EdKrassen They are not bigger. They are small racist haters that deserve to be in prison.
917164645747699712 2017-10-08 23:07:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram @matthewamiller TOTALLY! "Stand Fido"
917163377285304320 2017-10-08 23:02:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @RFCdan @RepAdamSchiff He had it "POTUS and I will not dignify any event".
917162393892982785 2017-10-08 22:58:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump @DenbrotS He looks like an old lizard.
917153401326186496 2017-10-08 22:23:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @medical91 @barry_corindia Dumb and Dumber!
917147593263763456 2017-10-08 22:00:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @c3391 My anger comes in waves these days. I'll be okay for awhile and then about 25th awful thing I snap. It's SO BAD!
917143907980529669 2017-10-08 21:45:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs @Acosta Their "stunts" are okay, OBVIOUSLY!
917143677453119493 2017-10-08 21:44:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @VP @MaryKeithBare1 @BanditRandom Yes Cons aren't in to details. It's all about the "optics" for them!
917131045690134529 2017-10-08 20:54:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr @mzleewilliams @XSovietNews @1stgrace108 And I'm pretty sure no liberal would nominate & elect him to be president at this point, so there's that. Cons have no standards any more.
917121575685709824 2017-10-08 20:16:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy @seankeats Save your crap. How much $$$ spent on HRC emails & Benghazi? For Nothing. Bahahaha they haven't even started on WH emails yet!
917003124929331206 2017-10-08 12:25:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @NomikiKonst @peterdaou Who?
916856286138064896 2017-10-07 02:42:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Trump put the Cad in Caddie,
916854964814835712 2017-10-07 02:37:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy @seankeats She discussed it during the debate. We aren't the kook-aid drinkers,that's rumpers. We believe in research, science & facts. Try it sometime
916816412345356293 2017-10-07 00:04:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @PreetBharara @SallyQYates @SenDuckworth @TheRickWilson @maxwellpower @cpcurtiss68 @kaboobola @PersuasivePR @jackiecall3 @BEickstedt I find her to be very impressive and attractive. I'd definitely vote for her. Run Sally Run!!!
916805757898813441 2017-10-07 23:21:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @GovHowardDean I think it's worse. The hate speak they consume has tainted their thinking. It's Twilight Zone worthy, for sure.
916797105032884224 2017-10-07 22:47:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Oh that's entirely different. 
916796693869457409 2017-10-07 22:45:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @bessbell Really, I can't control the animal magnetism.

I heard someone say he helped him with election and was totally impressed with her instead.
916794998955356161 2017-10-07 22:38:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mikel_Jollett @ObiWanPez @LReWH1 @BrianKarem folks reminded me.
916697057070632960 2017-10-07 16:09:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy @SmoothSebby Debby, right back at you but then I'm not the trump supporter!! Bahahaha
916683319949058053 2017-10-07 15:15:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @jonfavs So sadly true!!!
916640710560026624 2017-10-07 12:25:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy @BrianMcKeon5 Oh this author is/was a supporter? Bahahaha nice!
916640425208897536 2017-10-07 12:24:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy @SmoothSebby Oh you scared for Dotard trump? Well, you should be!!!
916640229678878721 2017-10-07 12:23:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy @women_4Trump Man you really are deranged lady. Seth Rich?? Ok Alexa Jones!
916639752551632899 2017-10-07 12:22:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy @TrumpsSouthHQ Wtf are you talking about?
916639219518464001 2017-10-07 12:19:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy Collusion has been obvious since before the election. Of course Trump cheated to steal the presidency. He was, is & will always be a CROOK.
916523458451902464 2017-10-06 04:39:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @twizler557 I swear it really seems like there are a lot of closet gays in the Repugs. Pruitt, Price, Sessions, Graham.
916522418520383488 2017-10-06 04:35:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti My God this guy belongs in a rocking chair somewhere. He's way too old to be in Congress.
916520689729003521 2017-10-06 04:28:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @janschakowsky @allenemies4n Infuriating. They can go screw themselves.
916514993868361728 2017-10-06 04:06:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @downhiller1976 More like a blood sucking rabid bat, I'd say.

916455342111973376 2017-10-06 00:09:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @PersuasivePR @jackiecall3 @cpcurtiss68 @maxwellpower @FoxxpawsJill Gavin who, sorry.

916429071801831424 2017-10-06 22:24:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @maxwellpower @jackiecall3 @PersuasivePR @cpcurtiss68 And he can't stand Dotard rump.
916428977362931714 2017-10-06 22:24:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @maxwellpower @jackiecall3 @PersuasivePR @cpcurtiss68 Haven't listened to Preet's yet. I'm sure I'd like it, he's smart and has good snark on twitter.
916428519722438658 2017-10-06 22:22:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @northeast_mama @jeffl76 They no longer represent real people, just real money.
916428397760434176 2017-10-06 22:22:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @northeast_mama @jeffl76 They approve of it
916428254139113473 2017-10-06 22:21:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @northeast_mama @jeffl76 I get the impression that Mueller is humping it, these things take time, unfortunately.
916427739850305538 2017-10-06 22:19:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @tcobb_lexloci @Amy_Siskind It pretty much always does.
916425613925404673 2017-10-06 22:11:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @maxwellpower @cpcurtiss68 @PersuasivePR @jackiecall3 Dems need to wise up and use the purge that Mueller is going to unleash. Folks know how bad they are now & we mustn't let them forget.
916424969588002817 2017-10-06 22:08:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @maxwellpower @cpcurtiss68 @PersuasivePR @jackiecall3 Also like Booker.

916423410200252417 2017-10-06 22:02:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @mshopemac @renato_mariotti The Cons are still Conning. Call their lying faces OUT!

916417774045581312 2017-10-06 21:39:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @maxwellpower @jackiecall3 @cpcurtiss68 @PersuasivePR Nancy is masterful at that.
916417498366529536 2017-10-06 21:38:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @maxwellpower @jackiecall3 @cpcurtiss68 @PersuasivePR Once again, so thankful the Cons are so divided or we'd really be screwed. Dems must have united front when we take back the House.
916415331828142080 2017-10-06 21:30:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @luckybetts @SaysHummingbird Mnuchin is very wealthy, at the very least he should pay the people back. So Damn Much Corruption. #RESIST

916388090117271562 2017-10-06 19:42:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @realBigBalls Hmmm I would have said sex change.
916386344473112577 2017-10-06 19:35:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @PersuasivePR Oh you mean those that included a rational President?
916385902557106176 2017-10-06 19:33:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mikel_Jollett We need the reporter who spoke up the last time to call out her BS.
916383778771173376 2017-10-06 19:24:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson Mercer is a total nut job hater with more money than God.
916383469219049472 2017-10-06 19:23:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson Neither is Junk Party Rick.

916380151998484482 2017-10-06 19:10:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @TVietor08 Excellent Question. They need to be outed.
916379943982063616 2017-10-06 19:09:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila @kimgoodspeed1 Odds are very good. I wish someone could convince him "the Apprentice" really is OVER.
916379679749234689 2017-10-06 19:08:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila Did she use the old "uhhh I haven't had a chance to discuss that with him yet"?
916377326589497345 2017-10-06 18:59:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @CillizzaCNN @CNN @sunnynodak If our candidate had to stoop to colluding with Russia & Comey help I would not brag about it but then that's why I'm A Dem & you're an R.
916362076381212672 2017-10-06 17:58:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @CillizzaCNN @CNN @sunnynodak Summer 2018 is just around the corner and we progressive social justice warriors are mad as hell and hAve no intention of taking it any more

916348315914178561 2017-10-06 17:03:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @CillizzaCNN @CNN @sunnynodak We've been freaking out because trump is a totally unscrupulous old letch who launders Rubles and lies incessantly. Pussy grabbing only part
916347532883591170 2017-10-06 17:00:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @CillizzaCNN @CNN @Kalogrym I don't blame Hollywood, I blame the money that holds such power.
916347147104276481 2017-10-06 16:59:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @CillizzaCNN @CNN @BABikerBob67 A lot more of these in The R party! We are not immune to Gross Men though.
916345946203713538 2017-10-06 16:54:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @CillizzaCNN @CNN Just because Democrats attempt to have some standards doesn't mean that we're immune to the over-Privileged White Man Syndrome.
916338519517343744 2017-10-06 16:25:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @mikefarb1 I Do Not trust Burr. He's been shady since this thing started. The Cons are running everything and their leaders are clearly compromised.
916336784182796289 2017-10-06 16:18:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @bessbell I like it. This gives pussy hat new found meaning. These guys are onto something! Women Unite, I'm sure Melania is in!
916307491058868224 2017-10-06 14:21:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @CheriJacobus Never Trump GOPers have given up to the RW Nut Jobs, Christian Crusaders, Tea Party Hater Extremists. It's up to rational Moderate Dems Now.
916306469028618241 2017-10-06 14:17:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @TheRickWilson And Miller. Hater Boy.
916305470339670016 2017-10-06 14:13:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @MeghanMcCain @bessbell @Mrsmaxdewinter Yes, contrast that to what rump did in similar circumstances. Mr Birtherism Bigot!!!
916261121467744256 2017-10-06 11:17:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @MeghanMcCain @bessbell @Mrsmaxdewinter I find the Cons lack of loyalty to their own to be completely distasteful. The "patriots" are a bunch of back stabbers & truncoats. Shocking
916170966249754629 2017-10-05 05:19:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance @davidfrum Meanwhile trump looks like he's demon possessed.
916152158562680833 2017-10-05 04:04:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProudResister Me too. Sometimes I haven't even met them but i can just tell they're nasty by how they carry themselves.
916149743247659008 2017-10-05 03:54:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @politico God she's really obnoxious. I sure hope she goes down.
916088386577948673 2017-10-05 23:51:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @MeghanMcCain @bessbell Yes the same nasty base that's been just terrible to her honorable father. Dems have not been nasty Meghan. We respect your Father.
916087592852041729 2017-10-05 23:47:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @MeghanMcCain Well your father lost fair & square and not to a total crook who colluded with Russia, so there's that. Also no FBI help to Obama either.
916086660433096704 2017-10-05 23:44:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 Awesome, he deserves every minute of it.
916030556655181829 2017-10-05 20:01:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Yea about as much as his bro Putin is.

915965774891757569 2017-10-05 15:43:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @YouTube @HillaryClinton @donnabrazile That was awesome! It made me laugh and cry. It's so tragic that she's not our President.
915958821490708480 2017-10-05 15:16:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @spokanetom @eileendefreest Lead by nasty white guy who's known nothing but Privilege & entitlement his whole miserable life. As if he has something to be ANGRY about.
915957786701418496 2017-10-05 15:12:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @spokanetom @eileendefreest Yes, they're not only haters of all things Dem they even hate leaders of their own party. Just ask McConnell & Ryan. It really is a Cult.
915955475124035584 2017-10-05 15:02:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @eileendefreest @SarcasticHoney @therealzanetta @AnniemharrisAnn You're sick

915955002258182144 2017-10-05 15:01:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @spokanetom @eileendefreest I don't know about that. They seem to be angry about a heck of a lot more than that. I'd say, Angry is pretty much their "brand".
915930829494288384 2017-10-05 13:25:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 Thank you Jane! I'll bet you're a fabulous doctor.

915910223889620992 2017-10-05 12:03:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyWchu Really, bring it on!!!
915909663543250944 2017-10-05 12:00:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones @kevin52850 I DO NOT TRUST BURR AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. I TOTALLY GET THAT, HE'S A LIAR VIBE FROM HIM. ANOTHER CON BOUGHT AND PAYED FOR. ONE AFTER ANOTHER.

915752887816478720 2017-10-04 01:37:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow So do I, we need some Dems here who have her moxie. She just speaks her mind which is refreshing!
915749194740244480 2017-10-04 01:23:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump Honestly, I'm not sure he could do it. I'm pretty sure he'd blow a gasket and throw a fit and just leave.
915748368911126528 2017-10-04 01:19:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Oh what a shame, NOT!
915747831524347910 2017-10-04 01:17:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @ShaunKing It didn't hurt him personally so that's what they call narcissism.

915726124277264390 2017-10-04 23:51:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias Oh come on Matthew, you can't blAme the guy, he's just building his brand.
915725398339489792 2017-10-04 23:48:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @Salon @alaskarebel @SafetyPinDaily No, it's who THEY are.
915723848313720832 2017-10-04 23:42:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Funny, Warner looks like he's going to hurl. I wonder why?
915722064144805889 2017-10-04 23:35:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattdpearce SICK. Guess those God & Gun Loving Patriots need some machine guns.
915701749327032320 2017-10-04 22:14:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @CampaignSift Oh god no, the science deniers are weighing in on vaccines and autism. Never mind what the actual experts who've studied it say.
915701147750592513 2017-10-04 22:12:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag @AriMelber Burr is a partisan hack, that's obvious.
915685535527636992 2017-10-04 21:10:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdanClay I personally enjoy it every day.
915683556277542913 2017-10-04 21:02:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur Tragic but "now is not the time to discuss gun control" says every GREEDY GOP.
915661116210073600 2017-10-04 19:33:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @VennMultiverse @taralynn1272 Me too Tara. He's so bad isn't he.
915657759265353729 2017-10-04 19:19:56 UTC <HenslerKate> Kiss of death right there, he loves that Friday afternoon news dump. Bye-bye Rexon not sorry to see you go. Please tell Putin to F off.
915657168535384064 2017-10-04 19:17:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @StopTheSpeaker Lyin Ryan will do absolutely nothing. After you endorse the Pussy Grabber, that's the end of that sort of thing.
915655934940205061 2017-10-04 19:12:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @StopTheSpeaker Cool let's start with his mental health.

915622366742491136 2017-10-04 16:59:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @BankingGOP @senjudiciary @SenJohnKennedy Repulsive display of being bought Senator. "Can't legislate evil" what total BS. Get rid of your metal detector  and we'll talk.
915621105066479617 2017-10-04 16:54:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @radioheadfloyd Yes and his worst ones are shown so much that we couldn't miss it if we tried! Short of being in a cave.
915620651456712704 2017-10-04 16:52:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @radioheadfloyd You are absolutely right. He's deserves public shunning for everything horrible that he has done. Bye Dotard!
915620301949595649 2017-10-04 16:51:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @radioheadfloyd Done
915597540757786625 2017-10-04 15:20:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAMandel Bahahaha
915592578183122945 2017-10-04 15:00:56 UTC <HenslerKate> How much do you all suppose Rexon got from his "good friend" Putin?
915591850861453313 2017-10-04 14:58:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP I'd rather be shot.

915588289620533248 2017-10-04 14:43:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepChrisStewart Oh it wasn't that he must have performed "illegal"move to convert gun to automatic?You looked like a lying fool on CNN. Shameful Performance
915585566552547329 2017-10-04 14:33:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Sir. Sincere question. What keeps you calling yourself a Republican?
915583078164258819 2017-10-04 14:23:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Richard now you know that's a Republican thing.
915568208400220161 2017-10-04 13:24:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @olgaNYC1211 Exactly Olga, he's definitely not the only crook now is he? A very sad and disturbing state of affairs.
915566455789359104 2017-10-04 13:17:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepSwalwell Thank you Congressman, we do appreciate this and also your willingness to speak honestly about trump and his dishonesty.
915563719698075649 2017-10-04 13:06:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @burgessev But Rand is a "fiscal conservative" remember all of his "Obamacare light" BS? Please.
915560761078026240 2017-10-04 12:54:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerBoehner @RaineyMcdonald Just happily mowing his lawn with a smile on his face saying "repeal and replace" Bahahaha

915553663132798976 2017-10-04 12:26:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @RWPUSA Say It Richard. "pro-life" Republican with an A rating from the NRA. Being in denial doesn't look good on you. This is what your party Is.

915545419681234944 2017-10-04 11:53:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC And a brain, that too would be helpful.
915448897727815680 2017-10-03 05:30:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @dangainor @DLoesch @BattleOfChelsea Facts? Look at how Southern States have voted over the last 30-40 years.

915440470955888641 2017-10-03 04:56:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @dangainor @DLoesch @BattleOfChelsea You were saying they were Dems, I said their party is irrelevant. Only a tormented mind would consider these horrific actions.
915438411380613121 2017-10-03 04:48:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @suevisa @perlmutations 2 weeks.
915438075936944128 2017-10-03 04:46:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @dangainor @DLoesch @BattleOfChelsea I have heard nothing of Vegas guys politics. All of these shooters are sick pups, regardless of party.
915437090430693376 2017-10-03 04:43:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @JackPosobiec Why is it that so few trump fans don't know the proper use of  "You're" and "Your"?
915436308885098496 2017-10-03 04:39:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @BattleOfChelsea @JackPosobiec Really Jack it's pretty obvious to see they were pushing "trumpian" positions. Let's not play dumb.
915435659061538816 2017-10-03 04:37:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @dangainor @DLoesch @BattleOfChelsea I have no idea what you're talking about. This is crazy talk.
915433906639446017 2017-10-03 04:30:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor #BoycottNFL that says it all Dan. What kind of a "media critic" would put that on Twitter. The kind sucking up to gross Dana Loesch. WRONG!
915432887910064128 2017-10-03 04:26:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor You're a nasty SOB Dan. That's plain to see. You know nothing about me so save your sanctimonious dribble.
915431725513179136 2017-10-03 04:21:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor Probably not sharing on Faux News anyway.
915431490158284800 2017-10-03 04:20:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @dangainor @DLoesch "God, family, guns" man that's really special Dana. How much did you charge to sell your soul to the devil?
915430964259643392 2017-10-03 04:18:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor "Great response" some rights should be taken.
915430227370741760 2017-10-03 04:15:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor Doesn't seem to require great brilliance to convert one to being automatic so once again,distortion of truth.Your bud in Vegas had how many?
915429416414728192 2017-10-03 04:12:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor You've shown your true colors by your initial statement. Why would I believe you? Clearly pathological lying is a Republican qualifier.
915428872153391104 2017-10-03 04:10:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor Not true.The whole gun thing in this country is out of control. Automatic rifles and silencers and vest piercing bullets-not rights.
915428128377458690 2017-10-03 04:07:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor Saying "read the label" anyone taking prescription meds..... just hyperbolic BS designed to rile your parties many crazy gun extremists.
915427539425939456 2017-10-03 04:05:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor Your original statement is ridiculous and untrue. The Republicans voted to allow people who are essentially wards of the state to buy guns.
915426770064695296 2017-10-03 04:02:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor Sure.
915426374227234816 2017-10-03 04:00:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch @dangainor Dan NRA paying you too? You should be ashamed.
915426041455312897 2017-10-03 03:59:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @DLoesch Hey Dana, you're despicable. Please be quiet.
915409166604406784 2017-10-03 02:52:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk @tenax666 @UnkleNeal I agree. It was just too perfect. I remember awhile ago seeing the odds of him winning in key states. So ridiculously unlikely and yet???
915404103261523969 2017-10-03 02:32:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @letahamilton383 @RVAwonk DOTARD TRUMP.
915396703599104006 2017-10-03 02:02:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @DrJasonJohnson Says the Russian talking head. Screw You Boris!
915388001097789446 2017-10-03 01:28:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @PittsburghPG Well, isn't he a peach.
915383776678694912 2017-10-03 01:11:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @JamesGleick What the bloody hell? This is sick.
915268488012419073 2017-10-03 17:33:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @ASlavitt @Nataliew1020 Oh it doesn't stop there. This is the tip of Bevin's Evil Iceberg. He's a "Prosperity Christian". #GOP:ThePartyOfMe
915267867553169410 2017-10-03 17:30:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk @ASlavitt Wonder if he'd feel differently if one of his many kids had been shot? #GOP:ThePartyOfMe
915249954205179904 2017-10-03 16:19:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @shoreboy1961 Yes I certainly can't argue with that! It's out of control.
915243837534203906 2017-10-03 15:55:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @sheri_scary @jevans15 @medcannabis1 @PassarelliAllan @PuestoLoco @KatheleenMitro I know the Cons disagree but that is "politically correct". The notion that all Americans are or should be Christian is very "UnAmerican".
915242282789609473 2017-10-03 15:48:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @sheri_scary @jevans15 @medcannabis1 @PassarelliAllan @KatheleenMitro @PuestoLoco Details,  like science and rational thought are not their friends.
915241513789149185 2017-10-03 15:45:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @DearAuntCrabby Thanks for the follow, I enjoy your posts!
915241113790926849 2017-10-03 15:44:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @TheRickyDavila It should be ILLEGAL. It's legalized bribery.
915238466149081088 2017-10-03 15:33:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @sheri_scary @jevans15 @medcannabis1 @PassarelliAllan @PuestoLoco @KatheleenMitro That being said,I do respect people's right to religion of all types. I resent the hell out of our current govt shoving Christianity throat
915237489140551680 2017-10-03 15:29:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @sheri_scary @jevans15 @medcannabis1 @PassarelliAllan @PuestoLoco @KatheleenMitro Well the burning in hell gets a lot of people (which is why they use it of course) 
915224855427141632 2017-10-03 14:39:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump Or maybe just a very hateful white man.
915212194245222401 2017-10-03 13:49:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @amovicky1 @justinjm1 I'm so not surprised. Tip of the iceberg  on that one. Kushner like his daddy is a high class crook. Apple/tree.
915210282997358593 2017-10-03 13:41:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @PuestoLoco @sheri_scary @jevans15 @medcannabis1 @PassarelliAllan @KatheleenMitro Same. I used to think of "Christians" as good people. I can honestly say now, when I hear "Christian" now I think corrupt & dishonest. Sad.
915199854195945472 2017-10-03 13:00:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @NRA @DrDinD Well that's a fact. It's deeply disturbing to me.It's just so wrong. And they've sold this twisted idea that guns represent Freedom so well.
915199168284692480 2017-10-03 12:57:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe @mikebarnicle @DearAuntCrabby Saw that and thought, yep that's exactly how I feel about him. He's completely exhausting & I cringe when he opens his nasty stupid mouth.
915197073456279552 2017-10-03 12:49:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarkFreedmanPol @bannerite @RobertWeinber16 I am with you. It must stop.
915196178349903872 2017-10-03 12:45:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @keithboykin Oh God, every time he opens his mouth I feel like I'm going to be sick.
915195101403631616 2017-10-03 12:41:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @YerOpinion Stan let's be honest, it's a hell of a lot more republicans than democrats. That's a fact. Hey maybe that why repugs drny so many facts!!!
915193201010642944 2017-10-03 12:33:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @HowardKurtz Media guy working for Faux, SURE.
915191531740565504 2017-10-03 12:27:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshuanassiri @ThatShockratees I agree it's gotten so out of control and the Cons are so complicit.
915191099425267712 2017-10-03 12:25:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow Probably not Charles but definitely not if you looked like you were the Middle East (welcome to America) where racists currently rule.
915190456551641089 2017-10-03 12:23:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanhannity @RobertWeinber16 @Kamgirl47 And yet anyone rational would say, not talking about gun control at this time is shameful. Hannity is a hired gun himself. Mr Conspiracy.
915189441018433536 2017-10-03 12:19:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @TruthOnly37 @MattAsherS Well said Matt #MAGA (Madmen Are Governing America)
915187643637485570 2017-10-03 12:11:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Amy_Siskind "Wicked White Man" would work.
915186160544223232 2017-10-03 12:05:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @datagoodies @DavidCornDC @PlumpyTrumpy @j_bustanut @JaneWin54532374 @harpera6627 @1pip2win @benCunn08101304 Not many did. And really, let's just be honest, anyone voting trump was exceptionally ignorant and gullible. They believed him & HRC crap.
915182338459529216 2017-10-03 11:50:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland @rich_outlaw Don't forget they had huge help from Comey just 20 days before the election. The kiss of death.
915181825881985025 2017-10-03 11:48:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag @ericgarland Yes but these people paying in rubles were running ads related to the US election. If that's not a red flag, then they chose not to see it.
915021568559992833 2017-10-02 01:11:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @SaysHummingbird That is outrageous. America should be completely ashamed of herself.
915020717003075584 2017-10-02 01:08:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Bingo, totally BONKERS is right!
914970656063787009 2017-10-02 21:49:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk Yes that is peculiar isn't it. 
914969959066980352 2017-10-02 21:46:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @thedesirina That's some sick stuff right there.
914966562498580481 2017-10-02 21:33:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorBurr We don't care about your lame statement. Stop taking dirty NRA $$$ and pass some reasonable laws related to limiting guns.
914965223316103169 2017-10-02 21:28:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorEnzi Stop taking Dirty Bloody NRA money Mike. It's WRONG.
914954951125864457 2017-10-02 20:47:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @GovMattBevin You may have a point as you are Governor.
914921423575109632 2017-10-02 18:34:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid As if that ever actually stops him.
914907957468499968 2017-10-02 17:40:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @datagoodies @DavidCornDC @PlumpyTrumpy @j_bustanut @JaneWin54532374 @harpera6627 Great pic they chose.
914903108437803014 2017-10-02 17:21:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Bevin is a "card carrying Christian" hater for sure. Also, he got a great "discount" on the house he currently lives in 
914892237330423808 2017-10-02 16:38:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan Tell that to your buds at the NRA. Your words are cheap, empty and hollow. Trumpcare would have killed way more than this. What's you excuse
914890850802552834 2017-10-02 16:32:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @ChrisMurphyCT Thank You Sir, thank you.
914880877544509441 2017-10-02 15:52:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @alotsmilesalot @ThatBarb Oh look, everyone is a Republican!pic.twitter.com/yzgolZZ3w9
914879631303561217 2017-10-02 15:47:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @HowardKurtz No, today is the perfect day. I can think of 50+ reasons why.The friends and family of the innocent victims will agree. Tomorrow never comes
914869670905249793 2017-10-02 15:08:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @Wordslingeuse Don't you just know that the first thing out of his mouth off if the "stage" is "how'd I do?" "I think I was great" "gonna boost ratings!!"
914869374116392960 2017-10-02 15:07:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @Wordslingeuse My thoughts exactly. Clearly he was trying to be full of compassion/heartfelt emotion. To me, it's like a spoof of a caring president.
914868923438333953 2017-10-02 15:05:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid For me, this is completely true.
914867908882427906 2017-10-02 15:01:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Yea that's so twisted.
914862576122650624 2017-10-02 14:40:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @YerOpinion Also Koch, Mercer et al whores.
914862079156391937 2017-10-02 14:38:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Wouldn't they just all say "zero"? And then change nothing.
914861649093435392 2017-10-02 14:36:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @4everNeverTrump Very Deeply Wrong!
914861300966154240 2017-10-02 14:35:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk @OhNoSheTwitnt @Peter68920649 That was "Bye"
914861070896033792 2017-10-02 14:34:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk @OhNoSheTwitnt @Peter68920649 By Russian hater bot!!!
914860680846733314 2017-10-02 14:32:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk @OhNoSheTwitnt @IamRoyalOcean1 @Peter68920649 Dumb. It's still mostly whites too.
914860378349359105 2017-10-02 14:31:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @MrGoalie35 @kylegriffin1 Who blocked this?
914852967181946881 2017-10-02 14:01:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @StopTheSpeaker This is not an issue regarding the number of deaths. It is an issue regarding the number of dollars.
914850834210488320 2017-10-02 13:53:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @Remy_Anne So Very True. Same assholes who want to take healthcare, women's rights, screw POC,hate Muslims, invite pollution, and claim to be Christian
914850038777511938 2017-10-02 13:50:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @datagoodies @DavidCornDC @PlumpyTrumpy @harpera6627 And disgruntled old white ladies too. I'm sorry to say.
914849589634748422 2017-10-02 13:48:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA It's so transparently an issue of shear GREED.Dems must do a better job of messaging this and other truth if we r going to stop this madness
914848585518284800 2017-10-02 13:44:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @datagoodies @DavidCornDC @PlumpyTrumpy @harpera6627 I don't know why he just won't implement his great "secret" plan already!
914848134601289730 2017-10-02 13:42:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @jackiecall3 @MeghanMcCain Praying is nice Meghan, but maybe you could use your platform to support reasonable gun control. Congress ready to pass ok to silencers?
914840559700897792 2017-10-02 13:12:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @Pan19591 Yes and he's pretty damn good at it too!
914836334954598400 2017-10-02 12:55:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @ShaunKing @risinginfidel Bullshit. I'm guessing those folks running for their lives were pretty darn terrified."Range of attacks" is BS.Terrorist implies randomness
914835601794506753 2017-10-02 12:52:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @letahamilton383 @ShaunKing Sad, sad fact.
914823335367888896 2017-10-02 12:04:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @PGourevitch @HippyChurchill Well they deny science, research, logic, rational thought so facts don't really effect them. It's very scary stuff. They just "believe"
914817590324813824 2017-10-02 11:41:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @shoreboy1961 @SenSchumer @puckroger What is that?
914817414528937984 2017-10-02 11:40:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @shoreboy1961 @SenSchumer @puckroger Why is it ok with you that top 1% gets most $$$ back with GOP tax "cut". That really says what they're about to me. Not Christian at all.
914816859404476416 2017-10-02 11:38:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @shoreboy1961 @SenSchumer @puckroger No I'm not. I do respect some things about organized religion. Regardless of which one. All have some good, all have some bad.
914810317506596864 2017-10-02 11:12:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP @JuddLegum @Vbiii241 Oh he cares. His future & income depend on it.
914809874466385920 2017-10-02 11:10:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jazzbo99 @JuddLegum These guys have gotten away with SO MUCH LYING,they clearly think they r going to continue to get away with it. It's revolting and must stop
914809008166490112 2017-10-02 11:07:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrettDoster @VincentHarris Call yourself a Christian and then be happy that Crazy hater Moore won. You're not a real Christian you're just a HATER with a cross. GROSS.
914804993881968640 2017-10-02 10:51:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @KAdnoub @ProudResister I am a member because I feel that trump is bringing out the worst In Our country. He Stokes the flames of intolerance & hatred. He must GO.
914803526517317633 2017-10-02 10:45:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs @ddale8 @Madam_Nyobi @ChaplicCarey Do you think trump will even say a word. Had shooter been Muslim, trump would have tweeted 8 X's by now. Maybe we could implement Idiot ban?
914799831423569922 2017-10-02 10:30:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @take_backUSA You are on the wrong track.
914799412429381633 2017-10-02 10:29:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @AdavisWilliams @JimVandeHei "Royal Family" is sad truth. Rexon will be next head to roll.
914798598952546304 2017-10-02 10:25:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @RayRLibrandi Interesting the connection between gun quotes above, "good Christians" and those people squawking about football players taking a knee. FU.
914798002849673216 2017-10-02 10:23:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @RayRLibrandi "But my 2A Rights" "I'm a Constitutionalist" "automatic weapons are fun" Go Screw Yourselves folks, I don't give a rats ass about your guns.
914796114280423424 2017-10-02 10:16:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @shoreboy1961 @SenSchumer @puckroger Yes 80% to top 1%.It will be good for trump, koch, mercer, mnuchin et al. Sustained 3% growth is a joke. Real Christians don't support trump
914689578233188352 2017-10-01 03:12:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @ACLU @MattBevin @atticascott @ForwardKy @laurendowell I guess he thinks you're a scared teacher. Bevin 
914675665366081544 2017-10-01 02:17:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @KahlerSabrina I'm done dealing Bots & dumb trump supporters Bye

914663456862867458 2017-10-01 01:28:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP That should really be pretty easy to do.
914657206800388096 2017-10-01 01:04:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrumpDefined It's just talk, I so don't buy it. Just trying to Up his street cred.
914656325249978368 2017-10-01 01:00:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @aaronjcarpenter Aaron you're gross. This has nothing to do with what they are protesting. Proud Christian who backs trump? Sure.

914649824095539200 2017-10-01 00:34:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRA @GovAbbott @bannerite @shannonrwatts I guess you don't know Texas very well?
914647914311536641 2017-10-01 00:27:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @KahlerSabrina Except she's a Republican so there's that. Do you think she's too brown to be a RepubliKlan?
914647061194317824 2017-10-01 00:23:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro And you're a Republican. How do you suppose Democrats feel? At least he's not a Democrat.
914646018318376960 2017-10-01 00:19:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @StopTheSpeaker How about money vultures?
914645469992714241 2017-10-01 00:17:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kaepernick7 @McFaul Well even I know the answer to that and I know crap about Pro football.
914643882557747201 2017-10-01 00:11:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @KimWeaverIA Well I DON'T accept him as my president and I never will. But I have accepted that for now, it's reality. I try to be positive about future
914643050470703104 2017-10-01 00:07:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @KimWeaverIA Yea, it's really like Twilight Zone. I've finally come to terms with the fact that it's real, unfortunately. #RESIST
914642570873118721 2017-10-01 00:05:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Oh come on now Seth, he did it with a lot of heart.
914641913285890049 2017-10-01 00:03:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @KimWeaverIA Just keeps getting worse.
914641564818911232 2017-10-01 00:01:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @RepSpeier @normcollier1 Norman shut your yap-that's ridiculous.
914641142905491457 2017-10-01 00:00:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @RepSpeier @JudePleat I believe that clueless DUMB BOT.
914639395042549760 2017-10-01 23:53:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @RepSpeier Something is wrong with this president!
914638035572142080 2017-10-01 23:47:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @NBCNews @lisalvsu2 Well said, me too!
914607256548904960 2017-10-01 21:45:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @syd3825 Ridiculous
914603995062259712 2017-10-01 21:32:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @DailyCaller @lsmith4680 You are really quite warped.
914587612219920384 2017-10-01 20:27:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @CampaignSift Look it's Actual Fake News!!!
914582739046879232 2017-10-01 20:08:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @CarmenYulinCruz @realDonaldTrump @LCARS_24 @NYCMayor Yes, they were so low, even for him.
914581626260246528 2017-10-01 20:03:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid What a dork. Look what he's wearing to a golf tourney. He looks like a mob boss. I guess because he is a mob boss.
914566075517476866 2017-10-01 19:01:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 That has become very clear. That's enough to keep them behind him too. It's really ugly.
914557081360977927 2017-10-01 18:26:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonlovett True, the dude is not right in the head. Dotard is So Right.
914554106987122689 2017-10-01 18:14:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @shoreboy1961 @SenSchumer GOP: The Party of Me. Selfish suckers aren't they.
914514941482295304 2017-10-01 15:38:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC Both Unfortunately.
914496685421813761 2017-10-01 14:26:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @amjoyshow @DavidCornDC Charlie is one of like six ethical GOP folks left. They just really need to stop using the term "conservative". That's OVER.
914494942948528128 2017-10-01 14:19:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @WilDonnelly Liar in Chief is a pathological liar. His words are completely worthless to us all.
914487614497058816 2017-10-01 13:50:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @objkshn @SarahLerner @WillD2090 @nealcincinnati @jokinandtokin Of course that girl was supposed to be from Kentucky 
914467859383902208 2017-10-01 12:31:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @DarrellIssa @realDonaldTrump @MikeLevinCA Pretty sure you have to have a conscience to feel shame so don't hold your breath on that one Mike.
914467194356011008 2017-10-01 12:29:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @boru2308 @ChrisMurphyCT Trump sounds like a spoiled child every darn day. Wish we could wash out his mouth and put him in time-out until we impeach his ass.
914466784685813760 2017-10-01 12:27:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @sherlocked1058 @JohnWDean @RobertWeinber16 100%  CORRECT.
914465297196896256 2017-10-01 12:21:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @CampaignSift You mean like holes in the ozone?
914464195361599488 2017-10-01 12:17:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @txmockingjay For all that trump hasn't accomplished it's going to take awhile to undo the really bad that he has accomplished. Priutt is rapist in charge
914463672218595328 2017-10-01 12:15:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @objkshn @SarahLerner @WillD2090 @nealcincinnati @BannonRudis @Ensign_poo Lol maybe "kick um in the dick"
914462909085954048 2017-10-01 12:12:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @objkshn @SarahLerner @WillD2090 @nealcincinnati @jokinandtokin Umm no. I noted that your experience sucked but it's much more common for women to be beaten by men than the reverse. Your ex sounds crazy.
914295507446624256 2017-09-30 01:06:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @morningmika @donbushong @SSCustomHomes Scary is the haters in those Chinese MAGA hats. Are you proud of your Dear Leader. Spending yet another weekend golfing while Americans die.
914294661249998848 2017-09-30 01:03:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @Jeanne0256 @KatMcKinley @rschmandt99 No those are commonly used actually.
914294136387379200 2017-09-30 01:01:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @PamLane44412792 Let me guess, RW Hater???
914293067540258818 2017-09-30 00:57:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika Yea but they're not really very important lives 
914285218328084480 2017-09-30 00:25:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @aaronchall Eat it Aaron! You're beyond hope. Enjoy your hating while it lasts-bye!
914284824948506629 2017-09-30 00:24:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump And luxuriating in yet another private club. He's just a common man looking out for other common men.
914283935693189120 2017-09-30 00:20:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @aaronchall Yes, Joy is smart & honest. So you wouldn't get her at all.
914283393331994624 2017-09-30 00:18:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Trashy trump tweets. I'm not going to miss them at all. Part of his pardon had better be instant incarceration if he ever tweets again.
914278551783960577 2017-09-30 23:59:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @rieth_damon @ForeverLogical Natch.
914277396794265600 2017-09-30 23:54:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @wilytone Neil has been bought and paid for. Wouldn't be surprised to find out he has a trashy trump condo somewhere & he's a white supremacist.
914258210311241728 2017-09-30 22:38:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @teenytinyflame He thinks he's deity. Donald, the Dotard Deity from Hell.
914250144610181123 2017-09-30 22:06:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @CarmenYulinCruz @realDonaldTrump @BreakingDTrump @impeach_d_trump @teenytinyflame @eugenegu No, for daring to put her lowly people above the Dear Leader. This is not America.
914242485144162304 2017-09-30 21:36:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @MJB_SF @JillGeisler @Timmbarton123T We can sure give a big thank you to "Fake a News" too.
914225500289159168 2017-09-30 20:28:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @AidenWolfe Deeply disturbed.
914213756401528835 2017-09-30 19:41:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @trytostopJane @ambertamblyn Or even the next time you think of yourself as a Republican. You all caused this shit!
914212783096500224 2017-09-30 19:38:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @AidenWolfe So true, Dotard is very easily threatened.
914212201359138816 2017-09-30 19:35:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @Unpersuaded112 Cheap darn it 
914211966331301889 2017-09-30 19:34:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @MJB_SF @JillGeisler @Timmbarton123T "Wow, what a crowd"!!!
914211679386439681 2017-09-30 19:33:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix @JillGeisler @ssanneab Me too Susanne!
914211564340772864 2017-09-30 19:33:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix @JillGeisler Line Obama when he hugged victims. You can really see it when they really mean it. I'll bet trump has never even hugged Melania like this
914210477206638592 2017-09-30 19:28:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DavidCornDC @Targrimm @barrieblonde I'd say they are sociopathic narcissists. Sound familiar???
914210128836079617 2017-09-30 19:27:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @Unpersuaded112 So not surprised. How does anybody not see him for the cheep carnival barker that he is? I just want to vomit every time he opens his mouth.
914208932750594049 2017-09-30 19:22:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @tonyposnanski Bingo Tony, Bingo!!!
914208367643697153 2017-09-30 19:20:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mynnoe @jonfavs "Garbage human being" describes trump perfectly.
914207735713079297 2017-09-30 19:18:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahLerner @crntbell Really, imagine the chaos!
914207474860863493 2017-09-30 19:17:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @objkshn @SarahLerner @WillD2090 @nealcincinnati @jokinandtokin Ok Jab that sucks but...for every guy who suffered your fate, how many women suffered at the hand of their man? Men are more aggressive.
914206923276341248 2017-09-30 19:14:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @objkshn @SarahLerner @WillD2090 @nealcincinnati Me too. They get more aggressive than women. Dangerous with Dotard and nuclear codes.
914206521852088321 2017-09-30 19:13:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @objkshn @SarahLerner @WillD2090 Dumb Bot!
914206434346270725 2017-09-30 19:12:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahLerner Perfection Sarah, simply perfection.
914206006372110336 2017-09-30 19:11:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald Going with, you betcha.
914205594948644866 2017-09-30 19:09:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DavidCornDC @Targrimm @barrieblonde I don't think Jim Jones or Charles Manson would have been good presidents but they were pretty "good" cult leaders.
914205014452768768 2017-09-30 19:07:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DavidCornDC @Targrimm @barrieblonde I didn't say true Leader, I said cult leader. He sucks at everything except he's really good at throwing red meat to his base. #Dotard
914160880400596992 2017-09-30 16:11:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenGillibrand Back in the day we used to say "Rude, Crude and Socially Unacceptable". They "rebranded" it to "politically correct" and "leftist". So Sad.
914159731358519299 2017-09-30 16:07:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @My2Sintz @speakout_april This Shit just never ends.
914159179446833152 2017-09-30 16:05:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @chelseahandler @Debfitz1953 That's nice. The hurricane that is trump is far greater reaching than Maria as bad as she was. Trump hits land every damn day-Wake Up Lady.
914158409037074432 2017-09-30 16:02:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @chelseahandler Have done and will continue to do so. Lyin Ryan Must Go. And Not because he's replaced with someone who is even more Reich Wing Crazy.
914138340470984704 2017-09-30 14:42:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @KatonDawson Please stop trying to defend trump and his Cabinet.Once they join him, they're all part of the champagne cabinet.Accept Reality
914137168662155265 2017-09-30 14:37:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @BreakingDTrump @impeach_d_trump @TruthOnly37 @eugenegu Oh please Doctor. It's just trump being trump.
914134234343837696 2017-09-30 14:25:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @ckorenowsky @Honeybee0808195 NO, I think they're enjoying the spoils of their victory (or at least trying to).
914133724924653571 2017-09-30 14:23:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou I will go to my grave remembering that fact Peter.Sad truth.I've never hated Rs(just saw them as selfish) but now I do hate them. DEPLORABLE
914132538645471233 2017-09-30 14:19:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @KangasMom1 I really like Al Franken, a lot!
914131455978205184 2017-09-30 14:14:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @45Fired And USVI.
914131318967083009 2017-09-30 14:14:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA 100% Tea. While they make reference to "personal responsibility". "Teach a man to fish" bullshit. You gotta have a pole to catch a fish.
914130686503784448 2017-09-30 14:11:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @PersuasivePR God I really want to see this happen. His choir boy routine but still support trump 100% is so gross.He'd eat his young for tax cuts to rich
914129365113475072 2017-09-30 14:06:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @AynRandPaulRyan One must ask, does he not care or is he happy to see them perish?
914127374551257088 2017-09-30 13:58:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @EPAScottPruitt @MelissaJPeltier @TimGuinee Oh God, him too. Well no surprise. Look at the shit he pulled in Oklahoma. Pitiful excuse for a human being.
914126936938569729 2017-09-30 13:57:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @AdavisWilliams @kylegriffin1 It's clear from this that this mayor has more class in her baby finger than trump has in his whole body. He's an International Embarrassment
914126185600348160 2017-09-30 13:54:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlexWitt @IAmSophiaNelson Ooops just saw that you retweeted Faux News. It takes a particular kind of person to sell out her race to vote her pocket book. How's Ben?
914125650021289984 2017-09-30 13:51:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlexWitt @IAmSophiaNelson We don't care if "you don't care" about a tax cut to the 1%. Just like all republicans trying to pay the Koch Bros et al. We see you too.
914122931789340677 2017-09-30 13:41:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 To even think that is completely repulsive but the Dotard tweeting that is so gross. Each offense makes me dislike Republicans a little more
914121632444186625 2017-09-30 13:35:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @davidaxelrod Yes, he also backed Rexon so I'm out. Sorry I can't stand to hear him because that's all I think about when I do.
914120989621014528 2017-09-30 13:33:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC @Targrimm Trump truly is a Cult Leader.
914120911338463232 2017-09-30 13:33:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC @Targrimm You know, I think folks who have been watching Fox & listening to Rush (and other hate filled media) have been completely brain washed.
914118931509600256 2017-09-30 13:25:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @thehill No surprise at all.
914117092093366273 2017-09-30 13:17:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC @RevShark No he's already more than proven the opposite. "When someone shows you who he is, believe him"
914116826866561025 2017-09-30 13:16:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC No, he clearly sees it as a selling point and sadly, he's right about that obviously. It's how he keeps his base in check.
914116418731483136 2017-09-30 13:15:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @cnni @CNN @smerconish The race baiting you talked about the Russians doing today is the EXACT stuff that Fox, Rush, Info Wars, Breitbart etc do everyday.
914112231952044032 2017-09-30 12:58:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Totally agree by a landslide!
914102855547736064 2017-09-30 12:21:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Oh God no wonder they have Cholera. I feel sick just seeing it.

913867394103283713 2017-09-29 20:45:40 UTC <HenslerKate> They don't call him Price for nothing. #GOP:ThePartyOfMe

913778045219110913 2017-09-29 14:50:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA No Richard. Hillary Clinton should be President. That's who Putin and trump worked against and stole the office from REMEMBER? Wtf?
913770045452554240 2017-09-29 14:18:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @PostEverything @washingtonpost I'm not sure "mark" is the proper term here. That implies he wasn't totally ready, willing & able. More like Partner, I'd say.
913769259683209216 2017-09-29 14:15:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @sharcat12 Well in her defense, she does call herself "pit bull mom" so is anyone really surprised that she's vicious and will turn on you in a minute?
913767832286109698 2017-09-29 14:10:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff @TWDcatmama I like Rep Schiff, A Lot. Sorry to say but in today's climate of "I like um dumb" he may be too smart to be elected. Sad to say...

913746576643850241 2017-09-29 12:45:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 I do still remember when there were things called "conflicts" but that was back when we had something called "ethics".
913745567813120001 2017-09-29 12:41:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost Well Barrack was President then so that's probably why.
913744243981799424 2017-09-29 12:36:18 UTC <HenslerKate> Hey @realDonaldTrump if you appointed Cab members who sought to help and not screw over their areas they would be able to fly commercially.
913739307667660800 2017-09-29 12:16:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @Dalton642 @brandt_brickell Sad Truth, in their defense, they've been working on their Racism ever since.

913570676283510785 2017-09-28 01:06:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @politico @PuestoLoco @donald_fitzhugh I mean, it's so out of control.

913523776423415809 2017-09-28 22:00:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @hondo750 I'm sure that's just the tip of the iceberg.
913523579966324741 2017-09-28 21:59:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT What? Data? What the heck is that?

913521132229324800 2017-09-28 21:49:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @starbuck13502 I expect irrefutable proof of that because otherwise I'll assume he's totally lying.

913428629488533504 2017-09-28 15:42:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Once again, right in step with rump.

913379401630437376 2017-09-28 12:26:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @ananavarro It was clearly needed. The Republicans, "the Party of Me" doesn't play well with others. Ana, you no longer fit in that party.
913378647502974977 2017-09-28 12:23:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @DelayKathleen @TVietor08 He's running scared the crazy "base" will turn on him like they have mcconnell, he should be, they will. Surely it can't be trump's fault

913269548962471936 2017-09-27 05:10:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonlovett Oh I will always remember how he wiggled on his belly like a reptile.
913269292006862850 2017-09-27 05:09:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonlovett He is the very definition of a sycophant.

913265507184373760 2017-09-27 04:53:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @PalmerReport @KeilynLiznel Ridiculous. Pushing his already failed tax cut to the Uber rich more important than saving lives. You #MAGA folks believe all of his lies.

913257168337620992 2017-09-27 04:20:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA There is something so off about this little weasel. He has a major Napoleon complex.

913255764554321920 2017-09-27 04:15:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @pacelattin I think he means his debt. The 33 mln he owes them.
913255064315277312 2017-09-27 04:12:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu Bring it on Congressman Lieu. We need a lot more of you. You are bold, direct and honest. A rare commodity in Congress, unfortunately.

913235542682333184 2017-09-27 02:54:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram @SteveSchmidtSES Well in fairness to trump, these Cab guys have been Class A Crooks for years. It's repulsive. They're literally the worst of the worst.
913233742973603840 2017-09-27 02:47:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheNormanLear Listened to you on Lovett Pod. You were great, you've still got it Norman!
913233109226856449 2017-09-27 02:45:14 UTC <HenslerKate> Wow Colin Allred for congress in Texas. That's all-WOW.
913192593609109504 2017-09-27 00:04:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub @matthewamiller INDEED.
913192323735048194 2017-09-27 00:03:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump GROSS.
913191318138081281 2017-09-27 23:59:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @marciaknutsen @bowie923 Yes but what they did under Obama sucked. So once they are exposed for the self-serving SOB's that they are. Dems will win maj & change it!
913137700814934019 2017-09-27 20:26:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos @RepDanKildee Rs will never "get" that. They need that 1% as their lives depend on it.
913136432335802370 2017-09-27 20:21:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @bowie923 @marciaknutsen Me too Marcia, I knew it would be terrible, but it's so much worse. Thank God the Rs are SO bad at governing bc it could be even worse.
913135904910462976 2017-09-27 20:18:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid I honestly get weepy when I think of them.
913134062629421056 2017-09-27 20:11:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @ClaraJeffery @ashleyfeinberg His voice kind of gave that one away.
913133632809766912 2017-09-27 20:09:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle Let's get Mueller to weigh in on that.
913132601807949825 2017-09-27 20:05:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @marianne_2009 @MeghanMcCain Yes Meghan it is. I know that Dems all agree, we respect your Father a great deal. We are sorry.
913128092897615872 2017-09-27 19:47:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @TaylorPollino @MollyJongFast @leonbergers @GlaserKT @AndrewRSchulze @LillyPaloma1980 Nope Ivanka is way taller.
913127840685707264 2017-09-27 19:46:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @TaylorPollino @MollyJongFast @leonbergers @GlaserKT I think Mikala Pence is quite fetching.
913125732255232001 2017-09-27 19:38:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedwoodGirl @RawStory "You're fired" is all we need to hear from trump on that!
913125333016162304 2017-09-27 19:36:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @DHSgov @Dalton642 @SenJohnMcCain We know you did Sir. We Dems love you for your decency. Thank You.
913124398336536581 2017-09-27 19:33:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobinBrenizer @AndreaChalupa Couldn't agree more Andrea. The Rs are going to pay for years to come for that completely selfish decision. I do wish Obama had gone ahead.
913120055080177664 2017-09-27 19:16:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 @maddow Wtf rump, you are terrible.
913117952156880896 2017-09-27 19:07:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepLawrence @RepRaskin @RepJayapal @RepRubenGallego @tedlieu He must GO!!! In any other admin, he would have gone on day one.
913115732598312960 2017-09-27 18:58:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @cre8ivetype @ddale8 Well...at least he's honest?
913060781146693633 2017-09-27 15:20:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @mspoint1106 @BeverleeHughes3 @wck461 I liked lex mayoral candidate who lost
913059660726509568 2017-09-27 15:16:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @DMRDynamics No doubt about it Doctor.
913057757254815745 2017-09-27 15:08:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @mspoint1106 @BeverleeHughes3 @wck461 I looked him up born in Alabama (no big surprise there) then moved to Louisville as a teenager so Senator most certainly can come from Ville
913056536817172482 2017-09-27 15:03:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @mspoint1106 @BeverleeHughes3 @wck461 But what about Mitch living here?
913052432300756999 2017-09-27 14:47:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 @mspoint1106 @wck461 I think that's more relevant for Governor, perhaps?
913051369376018432 2017-09-27 14:43:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 @mspoint1106 @wck461 I've alwAys heard that but doesn't mitch live in Louisville?
913042625179082753 2017-09-27 14:08:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @wapo @nytimes @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen @AngelaBelcamino @MyraDSirois1 If this is how your god is guiding you, you need a new one.
913040790103953408 2017-09-27 14:01:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Rteefact @ToDropADime2 @christoq Pretty sure he's pretty dumb. But, he is dumb like most cult leaders.
913039477018386433 2017-09-27 13:55:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @ToniaAdams Cool Dude Right There!
913039203767930880 2017-09-27 13:54:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @NicolleDWallace I remember kids getting swats for that crap in middle school. Actually, just trump's potty mouth would have warranted the dreaded paddle.
913034940182401024 2017-09-27 13:37:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @hondo750 @funder Bye bye Racist. "Yes, I just said it!!!"
913034275783610368 2017-09-27 13:35:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 But then (as far as name recognition) who would have thought that Obama could beat Clinton?
913033982522138624 2017-09-27 13:33:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 KY basketball reigns supreme. I'm kind of serious about a former player running. Was an ex UK player in Ag post here-he want to jail.
913032871572590592 2017-09-27 13:29:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @KremlinTrolls @AndreaChalupa Hang in there.
913032400061501442 2017-09-27 13:27:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @jules_su @realDonaldTrump @_USA_Patriot_ @williamlegate @fukercarlson Failure to observe nepotism rules.     Failure to appoint Cab posts that help & not hurt. Failure to act as World Leaders.
913031378970791941 2017-09-27 13:23:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @lilomeRita Yes, I can think of about 400,000 reasons why.
913030808948047876 2017-09-27 13:21:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @PattyMaeBranton Are you sure about that? Isn't that what Reed changed? I think it got zero republican votes.
913030260173701120 2017-09-27 13:19:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 We need a former basketball player to run. I hear Pitino is going to be looking for a job. Bahahaha just kidding!!!
913029662502260736 2017-09-27 13:16:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @jules_su @realDonaldTrump @_USA_Patriot_ @williamlegate @fukercarlson Yes I like this game!
913029319483641856 2017-09-27 13:15:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshrogin @JRubinBlogger Jennifer, the GOP polls have sold their souls to the devil.They are gone.The few remaining are on the last train out. McCain, Dent, Corker..
913028379162681344 2017-09-27 13:11:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 Not sure. Dems are few & far between in KY :( I don't think Beshear wants it. I'm personally not a big Conway fan. Hmm??? Mae?
913027543321710592 2017-09-27 13:08:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @mspoint1106 I agree Mae. She seems to be trying to step it up a bit as of late but I want to win.She's very rehearsed & deliberate. Not owning BHO vote?
913026667970482176 2017-09-27 13:04:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 Yes. Media asked her two or three times and she squirmed & said some crap about it's a personal matter. Really Allison, wtf?
913026276147040257 2017-09-27 13:03:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @Alyssa_Milano That Blue Wave is picking up steam. Yes!!!
913023067802279936 2017-09-27 12:50:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 I really had a problem with her not "admitting" that she voted for Obama. I thought it was pretty ridiculous, she is a Dem. Own It.
913022726977269760 2017-09-27 12:49:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 I haven't heard, not sure it's been announced. I like her pretty well but I think we need a bit stronger candidate.
913019490455183361 2017-09-27 12:36:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeverleeHughes3 I am going to work tirelessly to help unseat this SOB in 2020.
913018765415153666 2017-09-27 12:33:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @JessicaValenti Sorry Jessica. These are very scary times. Thank you for standing up for women.
913015717708132352 2017-09-27 12:21:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @renato_mariotti Mark deserves to pay BIGLY for his complicit and complacent behavior.
913015162113753091 2017-09-27 12:19:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @HouseGOP @thekoukoureport Sure hope Big Brother kept an eye on that slime ball
913013705192992768 2017-09-27 12:13:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @carrieksada @bbusa617 @Franklin_Graham @BasedMonitored @johngault071 @RobinBrentwood1 @Too7Blessed777 @Godsgirl158 @joancarroll @jstines3 @cortxa @God_sgirl By the way, your position has NOT aged well.

912877756035235840 2017-09-26 03:13:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump So Much Winning!!!
912859209070514176 2017-09-26 01:59:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @MalcolmNance @Carter_PE Music to my ears!
912853549322817541 2017-09-26 01:37:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Yea whatever, only your racist followers agree with you. Have you been indicted yet?
912846083205758976 2017-09-26 01:07:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @keithboykin @jerweber Bahahaha like a lot of others it seems.
912845867748593665 2017-09-26 01:06:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @keithboykin God No, he's awful.
912845575665700864 2017-09-26 01:05:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidaxelrod Wtf is that so he can discuss running for the state of OK. Okies must be pretty gullible if they'd vote for that crook.
912844863011508224 2017-09-26 01:02:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu If he has no respect for the truth (obvious) we can assume no respect for the law. He only respects money.
912821350716334083 2017-09-26 23:29:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @letahamilton383 @thehill DARN!
912818606374887425 2017-09-26 23:18:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins Thank you Senator Collins. You care about your people, a very rare thing for Republicans these days.
912691312847196161 2017-09-26 14:52:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @CeeLeeMusic Same. Or even an American. Not Russian's support for trump I understand.
912690792258347013 2017-09-26 14:50:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @WalshFreedom God you are really gross.
912652207903911938 2017-09-26 12:16:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @ManMountain78R3 Ivan, do you not see the irony of Newt making that statement?
912651593555873792 2017-09-26 12:14:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You are the very definition of CRASS.
912650896370208768 2017-09-26 12:11:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump One word: TEXAS
912649665321029632 2017-09-26 12:06:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @AdavisWilliams @ddale8 KY would be happy with that. Where do we sign up?
912648451556507650 2017-09-26 12:02:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @BernieSanders @amyklobuchar @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC @jaketapper Take Away Jake. Republicans Lie, A Lot.
912646534642139136 2017-09-26 11:54:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC @gunnergoz He's not, he's just of Faux News a lot.
912645998018691072 2017-09-26 11:52:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC Good lord, Newt, it's not trump the great divider going on about Blacks & Hispanics being Bad all of the time. It's HRC recognizing Racism.
912520083687313408 2017-09-25 03:31:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuddLegum Wow, flipped to Fox to see what they were up to and saw this nut job for the first time. Is that Sessions pretending to be a Church Man?
912518735470190593 2017-09-25 03:26:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @CNN @GailRNJD @HRCNJVolunteers Same Old Shit.
912494368388468738 2017-09-25 01:49:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @girlsreallyrule No I think it's called the "keep our asses out of jail" fund.
912493172508577792 2017-09-25 01:45:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump So, the fact that when it really mattered Senator McCain had a conscience was a bad thing?
912488944721448960 2017-09-25 01:28:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @maddow @ChrisMurphyCT Give um hell Senator!
912487746056355840 2017-09-25 01:23:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer Bring it on. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, that is going to be so interesting.
912487258065981440 2017-09-25 01:21:30 UTC <HenslerKate> It's outrageous to jam through a terrible bill like #GrahamCassidy without knowing its impact #DoNoHarmhttps://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54gh1xt/4u54e
912481691071107072 2017-09-25 00:59:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @NatashaBertrand WTF??? Gee thanks for your concern Don.
912481368461893632 2017-09-25 00:58:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Kat4Obama He finally tweets about PR and that's all he can come up with? That's just pathetic.
912471193499947008 2017-09-25 00:17:40 UTC <HenslerKate> It's really rather strange that the only people in the GOP congress with any damn balls are one 81 yr old war hero and two women.
912469676525019138 2017-09-25 00:11:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @adamcbest So Sadly True.
912431661362679808 2017-09-25 21:40:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @gniluapnawak Yes, sorry to say, I think you're exactly right.
912344933062848516 2017-09-25 15:55:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @DrRandPaul You are always BSing about States' Rights, do you think we don't know what a sleazy crook Bevin is? Please Rand, that's just insulting.
912342883797172225 2017-09-25 15:47:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @Adamtheactivist @fukercarlson Yep, No Darn Way.
912340059705282560 2017-09-25 15:36:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @keeltyc Way too late for that.
912339911495348224 2017-09-25 15:36:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC I choose Universal Heslthcare and voting out all hater Republicans. That definitely includes you Lindsey!
912338810113019905 2017-09-25 15:31:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @dumptrump33 @ScifiDiva @BootyManMoney Yes because trump golfs every flipping weekend. How dumb.
912337732810264576 2017-09-25 15:27:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @ScottJenningsKY Don't count your chickens Scott.
912337563242962945 2017-09-25 15:26:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @ScottJenningsKY Big rash on your face on tv, does kissing trump's rear make you break out?
912336298731622402 2017-09-25 15:21:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @ScottJenningsKY So sorry to hear you are here in Louisville. GROSS.
912335364047740928 2017-09-25 15:17:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @lisamurkowski @angry_gram @benwikler Life long Dem here. If I could I would vote for Lisa Murkowski. First time I've ever said that about a Republican.
912333590364647424 2017-09-25 15:10:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @BenSasse Or I don't know, you could take a stand against systemic racism in this country Ben. Just a thought.
912318092214226945 2017-09-25 14:09:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @TomWellborn @medical91 @wtfdoicare33 Ok I know this is dumb too but it is a bit funny.
912296556203855872 2017-09-25 12:43:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @newtgingrich @FoxNews Damn, I was hoping newt had been indicted. What a snake.
912293311586684928 2017-09-25 12:30:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @catherinemom23 @fukercarlson Hope you are right. It's so bad, I'm concerned our Country may be in a death spiral. So much has just been ignored.
912292600731795458 2017-09-25 12:28:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell @dwpalmersheim Donna you have as much loyalty & respect as all trumpers. Shameful. You complain of race baiters & support trump? That's irrational.
912291942012215297 2017-09-25 12:25:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell Maybe in the world but certainly not in our Congress.
912290509137248256 2017-09-25 12:19:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @catherinemom23 @fukercarlson Yes, that in & of itself, told us all just how low they were willing to go. Nothing has changed. There's no limit.
912287350151053313 2017-09-25 12:07:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @agent_orangutan @catherinemom23 Exactly how I feel Cat. What they have done & cont to do is just completely unforgiveable. They all deserve to be jobless. It's Shameful.
912176559859134465 2017-09-24 04:46:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @tpcjk @JackPosobiec @princessdianej Ridiculous.
912174979701190656 2017-09-24 04:40:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @dychejs @majord2102 Why is it that one thing that universally unites trumpers is that they don't know when to use "your" & when to use "you're"? Seriously.
912173870362382336 2017-09-24 04:36:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @dychejs I Love It.
912170698797445120 2017-09-24 04:23:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @DerekCressman @BillKristol No Bill it's not. It's totally corrupt and rotting. It needs to go the way of O'Reilly.
912162211820392453 2017-09-24 03:49:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @RandPaul @lisamurkowski @jaketapper @JRubinBlogger Sure hope they're right.

912127240946749440 2017-09-24 01:30:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @gkoetzner @ChrisMurphyCT @LesBreeding1 @Jimwilson14 No, I can't stand Mitch (my Senator) but ole Mitch isn't dumb, he's just a snake who sold his soul along time ago.
912126548345524224 2017-09-24 01:28:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @ChrisMurphyCT Yea no way KY wins. Tea Party Nut Job Bevin will do his best to deny people healthcare, you can take that to the bank.
912109369118031872 2017-09-24 00:19:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @lizfinger1 No Kidding, what a joke.

912069906623029251 2017-09-24 21:43:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer #'s on our side but our voices must be heard.
912054754871791616 2017-09-24 20:42:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @ASlavitt @sajanorth22 @SRMex That's exactly right. Total Fakes.

912041052646854656 2017-09-24 19:48:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @WilDonnelly Bahahaha Details.
912038845876760577 2017-09-24 19:39:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA So True.
912036978086080512 2017-09-24 19:32:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @ASlavitt Or human being for that matter.
912036837086121984 2017-09-24 19:31:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @ASlavitt Rand is such a pitiful excuse for a doctor.
912013146218516480 2017-09-24 17:57:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @Discon1948 Very interesting that these people who are so into "personal responsibility" are also so into dictating how others can be responsible.
911990142830809088 2017-09-24 16:26:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger It might take more than the Six of you to deliver that message effectively.
911960021545734144 2017-09-24 14:26:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder I'm far from Christian Right but I really do find his profane language offensive. Saying SOB on TV is not presidential. He's OFFENSIVE.
911951438464655361 2017-09-24 13:52:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas @Joanvanderlinge No looked like standees were inback row (I think, right)
911951165801336832 2017-09-24 13:51:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepJasonLewis You are GROSS. Because a football player makes a lot of $$$ he should not be able to take a knee. White Lady here, Shut Up!!!

911940876104081410 2017-09-24 13:10:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Donny is a Dolt. Donny is a Dotard. Donny is derelict of his duties.
911788109209141248 2017-09-23 03:03:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @grantstern Hmmmm that's just SO Wrong.
911776002992418817 2017-09-23 02:15:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @Unpersuaded112 I find him completely repulsive. He tried to pretend that he's such a good guy. He and Pence, the two biggest hypocrites in D.C.
911770331068731392 2017-09-23 01:52:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @JeffreyGoldberg @bbkaksy Or Paranoid.

911747154812837889 2017-09-23 00:20:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahsMimi @thehill So wrong. Typical R.
911737010985082880 2017-09-23 23:40:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub Really this isn't really a question.
911728841411956742 2017-09-23 23:07:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @LCARS_24 Teddy was right. Trump is 0/3. We're screwed.

911270830339960833 2017-09-22 16:47:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @PersuasivePR @johnrutledge It's so sick. I'm guessing ICE agents make most cops look good.
911260809166245889 2017-09-22 16:08:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @amyklobuchar Senator, begging you not to debate the Rs on healthcare. We need to defeat Graham-Cassidy first. Sanders is not a Dem. Too soon for this.
911257668911812608 2017-09-22 15:55:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @gingwing23 Well, my 86 year old Racist mother in law does.

911202378086526976 2017-09-22 12:15:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders No Debate until Cassidy-Graham is dead. Stop screwing the Dems.

911042036123521024 2017-09-21 01:38:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @jmpalmieri Totally agree Jennifer. It's great that Dems are smart but clearly to be elected you need to be able to dumb it down. How hard can that be?
910961778120708096 2017-09-21 20:19:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillCassidy Yea, calling bullshit on that Bill.

910524739151679488 2017-09-20 15:23:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @PoliticalIntent I don't deal with MAGA folks or Faux News fans either. Mock and Block
910522772622839809 2017-09-20 15:15:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @cheriebibo @tonyposnanski Wow, that's really something isn't it. Wow.
910521040249466883 2017-09-20 15:08:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Pie_SocialMedia @Marmel I could be wrong, but there seems to be a whole lot of closet gays in The RepubliKlan party. What do you all think?
910520372998569985 2017-09-20 15:05:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @MattJorg4543446 @dukkiller9 I'm done exchanging with you Marlon. Haters gonna Hate.

910517714040573952 2017-09-20 14:55:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @MattJorg4543446 @dukkiller9 Acknowledging reality is not feeling guilty.Besides with so many out there who feel like you do shouldn't some of feel just a little guilty?
910517160342155264 2017-09-20 14:53:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @MattJorg4543446 @dukkiller9 Well that's just dumb Marlon. It's just really dumb. Only honest thing in your statement, "I have no sympathy"

910515093657571328 2017-09-20 14:44:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenJohnBarrasso Man you are really a Liar. Does that bother you at all? It sure doesn't seem like it.
910514001334980608 2017-09-20 14:40:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @OhNoSheTwitnt @fukercarlson Really, they hired Chaffetz.
910512364126195712 2017-09-20 14:33:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk Well I don't think Flynn really had an alternative so let's not give him too much  credit on that.
910511396361834497 2017-09-20 14:30:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @USSRSanctions @yashar Well Price is a TOTAL DICK, so maybe that has something to do with it.
910510974851059712 2017-09-20 14:28:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @RickSmithShow So Gross.
910509788924129280 2017-09-20 14:23:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @nwg83 @ezraklein Wow, what a bunch of bull hunky.

910502891206701056 2017-09-20 13:56:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @MattJorg4543446 @dukkiller9 Seeing white privileged diesnt mean you did nothing or didn't earn what you have. Just means u had choices they didn't. It's a fact.
910502387521130497 2017-09-20 13:54:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @MattJorg4543446 @dukkiller9 You may be correct that at least many can do it but NOT everybody has the opportunity to do it. Because you had it, you think they had it.
910358936729083905 2017-09-19 04:24:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @dyls26 @jonfavs @ajwahls Oh for Christ's sake. You are so off your nut.
910357706598486016 2017-09-19 04:19:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs Do you think that's because Tom Price is a Total Scum Bucket?
910356820576935936 2017-09-19 04:15:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Is this a Joke?

910351014208950279 2017-09-19 03:52:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @marciaknutsen Yes, I didn't see to much, but enough. He's a shart on American history. Sure hope we rid ourselves of him before he invites nuclear war.
910349986814193664 2017-09-19 03:48:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @MattJorg4543446 @dukkiller9 Of course not. You've convinced yourself you've "earned" everything you have. But you/we had the opportunity to "earn" it. Sorry, it's true.
910348969489960961 2017-09-19 03:44:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @olgaNYC1211 I'll bet a lot of illegal crap went down in the last 11 years. Bring it on, Mueller. We are Ready.

910271883609821184 2017-09-19 22:38:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @DrivingMisCrazy Same here in KY, not buying it either.
910271340556558336 2017-09-19 22:36:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @kcoffelt79 I'm guessing very good. He's been with trump for quite awhile. No way he's clean.
910270582805221379 2017-09-19 22:33:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @Alyssa_Milano What's not to like? Vote this and RepubliKlans out. They are shameful.
910262237847310338 2017-09-19 22:00:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezraklein I agree. They had their shots, we need younger and more electable for sure.
910253100723851266 2017-09-19 21:23:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @Varidienne @moira Rich and Crooked is all the GOP require. "DEPLORABLE" doesn't begin to do them justice. Pond Scum.
910251804994211840 2017-09-19 21:18:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @anniekarni Nukes?
910249006139416577 2017-09-19 21:07:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @3cutebabies @TeaPainUSA @LouLachat I thought Pence was Koch Bros doing? Manafort?
910247892522344448 2017-09-19 21:03:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @PlumpyTrumpy @TeaPainUSA That's a knee slapper Tea. Probably also true. That and Jack Daniels.
910246618615701504 2017-09-19 20:58:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @VP @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis @EllieJay43 He's So Plastic, Plastic Pence. Proud Graduate from the Koch Bros School of Bought and Paid For. Putrid Pence.
910245382797570048 2017-09-19 20:53:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis Or just make a video with him dubbed in and let him watch it?
910239948762165254 2017-09-19 20:31:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @maddow At this point, I'd honestly be surprised if he weren't. How sad is that?
910239074375671808 2017-09-19 20:28:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @imillhiser Wtf? What FA Christie going to do?
910238411931443201 2017-09-19 20:25:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @mzvxb Because so many people believe all of the Fake News. It's out of control.
910235758899888128 2017-09-19 20:14:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @JLP4488 @RawStory Yes, I've really been wondering that myself. Not that I miss him one bit.
910177348812787712 2017-09-19 16:22:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezraklein @shunelees Repealing ACA is not popular. Only with his lowest base. Rs are gullible & believe their own hate speech. It's sad isn't it. So Sad.
910173689915871233 2017-09-19 16:08:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @BiglyPrez @DavidCornDC Sounds About Right.
910162220826398722 2017-09-19 15:22:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezraklein @shunelees No that's not true.

909991529325920256 2017-09-18 04:04:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 No it's not illegal to unmask. They do it to add context/meaning.
909989674122346496 2017-09-18 03:56:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila Good night Ricky, hope your family is all ok.

909988331316027392 2017-09-18 03:51:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 No Manafort was target. Picked up those he communicated with. That's the way it works. Don't like it, don't talk to criminals.
909980997378281472 2017-09-18 03:22:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 And what does that tell you? He's only been in office what 8-9 months? Sad.
909980640908627968 2017-09-18 03:21:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 The fact that it was just COMPLETELY DEBUNKED was on the news.
909980410926571520 2017-09-18 03:20:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 This is totally Fake News & has been completely debunked. Just trump BS.
909980047011991554 2017-09-18 03:18:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 I mean Manafort, Pence, Flynn, Prince, Sessions, Bannon, Kushner, Miller, Cohen et al. Look how many of those are already gone 
909979351143337990 2017-09-18 03:15:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 I hope that when it does, you will take a long hard look at what you chose to believe from Faux Fake News. And open your eyes to the truth.
909978630322827267 2017-09-18 03:13:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Marlon, you seem nice & it's been fun talking to you. The day is not too long off that the truth will come out about trump & other crooks.
909978326630125568 2017-09-18 03:11:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Yes of course they would if it were true? They talked about Hilkarys email constantly meanwhile trump committed treason with Russia.
909978030906462208 2017-09-18 03:10:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 It's not Fake News Marlon. Look at the "journalists" on Faux News. Not exactly an impressive lot. Hannity the college drop out...
909977716677595136 2017-09-18 03:09:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 OMG that has. Even debunked at the highest level Marlon. Any "wiretapping" had FISA warrants that were legally obtained.
909977321016299520 2017-09-18 03:07:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Bet you have NO Real source on that Podesta bull. If so, please share.
909977100236582918 2017-09-18 03:07:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Yes of course I do. That's what the RW media says to try and deflect from Trumprussia. No investigation into Podesta.
909976595129094144 2017-09-18 03:05:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Who is "questioning" him? FBI? No wait, that's everybody in the trump admin. Everybody does not interfere with everybody else's election.
909976217868267520 2017-09-18 03:03:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Ivanka is nothing. Certainly not an advocate for women. The owner and his sons are all about the money. Do you miss raunchy O'Reilly?
909975290037891072 2017-09-18 02:59:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 At least it's real news but I prefer MSNBC .
909975120122466304 2017-09-18 02:59:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Gee I wonder why they've never gotten in any trouble for that?
909974987297173504 2017-09-18 02:58:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Hate Pence-he's such a Liar and false Christian. Koch plant for sure.
909974643834064896 2017-09-18 02:57:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Why do you suppose there have so darn many Meetings with Russians in the trump camp. Even Shep guy on Faux has acknowledged that.
909974232838361089 2017-09-18 02:55:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 What lie is that? Why do you suppose Faux is not allowed to call themselves "News"? Faux News is trump propaganda.
909972624293400576 2017-09-18 02:49:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 I live in Louisville not the country but I have been on a Polaris a # of times. I'm from Northern IN but I've lived here a long time.
909972205605462022 2017-09-18 02:47:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Well it's kind of hard to see but I think the average Faux viewer is about 70. I see you don't think trump is a white supremacist. Good one
909970950766186496 2017-09-18 02:42:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Did you get that "info" from Faux News?
909970788937289729 2017-09-18 02:41:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 I'm sure they are.Their foundation has done a lot of good things. Unlike trump's BS "foundation" that he routinely uses as  personal funds.
909969575126732800 2017-09-18 02:37:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @David_Gergen @KurtSchlichter Yea but the Griffin thing was BAaaaaad.
909969231034437637 2017-09-18 02:35:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @spokanetom @David_Gergen Heck No, Of Course they won't.
909968664249675776 2017-09-18 02:33:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Faux News? I mean "entertainment channel"? You don't look like you're old enough to watch Faux. My mother in law likes it too

909963532275523584 2017-09-18 02:13:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 You seem to have a lot of toys!!! Do you have a wife?
909963250569277442 2017-09-18 02:11:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Well, not to this liberal, that's for sure. Seriously, you seem to believe a lot of the conspiracy stuff-where do you get that stuff???
909962625894830080 2017-09-18 02:09:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Well this was driven like a car, I guess.
909962288911790080 2017-09-18 02:08:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 And earth quakes, lots and lots of earth quacks. Who again is selling out for $$$
909961911793602560 2017-09-18 02:06:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Oh not sure if it was 4 wheeler or side/side. Def 4 wheel drive
909961341234016257 2017-09-18 02:04:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Crazy talk Marlon, you shouldn't believe your Fake News sources. Soros has however been very generous to me with $$ for protesting 
909960376967733248 2017-09-18 02:00:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 I've been on those before
909960117457752065 2017-09-18 01:59:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 What is a Polaris?
909960047505166337 2017-09-18 01:59:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Ok not sure I totally get it exactly  but kind of.
909959281339977730 2017-09-18 01:56:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 I've seen oil rigs-haven't actually been there. Lived in So CA years ago. How's all that fracking working in Oklahoma? Pruitt did great job
909958077302104065 2017-09-18 01:51:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 The Yeti cup part is funny
909957969302999040 2017-09-18 01:51:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 I thought the side/side was a four wheeler
909957671364775936 2017-09-18 01:49:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Obama made moves to make more land Nat Parks to preserve them. Trump's all about the ole mighty dollar-you know this-right?
909957320590929920 2017-09-18 01:48:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 The Rs are opening them up to industry for money. Exactly what you accuse the Dems of. Surely you know this, you don't seem dumb.
909956188342808577 2017-09-18 01:43:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Funny that's exactly what trump and Co are doing with all of the most beautiful parts of the Country. Do you really not see that?
909955533981065216 2017-09-18 01:41:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Looked it up. Prob not a great mix with the adult beverages but boys will be boys.
909954925853122565 2017-09-18 01:38:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 What is a side by side?
909954786967130113 2017-09-18 01:38:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Oh I don't know, I could be Moslem. I'm definitely Liberal.
909954086677729280 2017-09-18 01:35:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 I kind of knew you were "on the right".
909953913448796160 2017-09-18 01:34:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 They don't, as I said. You look nice enough, but looks can be deceiving. You've been to more states than I have-trying to work on that.
909953287570558981 2017-09-18 01:32:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 I do pay attention to Real News. Where in the heck is that "the news"? Breitbart? RT? Do tell
909952818244710400 2017-09-18 01:30:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 What is mudride?
909952538287513600 2017-09-18 01:29:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 I did. Are you in the middle? Your son on your right, maybe? I see you like hunting. Your guns don't scare me.
909952153443291136 2017-09-18 01:27:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Yea Manafort is/was nothing. Only his campaign manager. Just a bit player.
909951828506406913 2017-09-18 01:26:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Gee I'm shocked! Hillary is not going to jail. Do you really believe that BS?Really? For what? Bad pantsuits?
909950773425004544 2017-09-18 01:22:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Do you mean Muslims? You spell like your main man trump. Nice. Why proud to be a Redneck? Deplorable too, I'll bet.
909950228161351680 2017-09-18 01:20:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 "Things" are not looking good for trump & his band of crooks. But then you're not really open to hearing that are you?
909949491465289729 2017-09-18 01:17:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Sure. We'll take the Northern affluent states and you can have the poor Redneck South. I guess you don't keep up with Real News.
909948940476387328 2017-09-18 01:15:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 How much time & $$$ tovtry & get HRC for Benghazi by Congress? Zero was ever found & yet still you want to see her hang for it? Redneck much
909948205915365377 2017-09-18 01:12:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 Man you're gross. Iran/Benghazi. How are you on trump's treason-that's just fine?
909942794235588609 2017-09-18 00:50:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @FloridaGOP @Pk9D4SRbxbd8zq5 @funder @stengel_jim Well thanks. It is pretty here. But it's pretty Redneck too. No plCe is perfect. Like Texas, our schools are pretty bad.
909941345925640194 2017-09-18 00:44:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @FloridaGOP @Pk9D4SRbxbd8zq5 @funder @stengel_jim Well kind of, my husband has Texas family. They went to ranch there every year and one year we went. Went to SA that year as well.
909939743638646785 2017-09-18 00:38:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @FloridaGOP @Pk9D4SRbxbd8zq5 @funder @stengel_jim San Antonio is pretty nice too. Went to a ranch in Bandera once-cool area.
909931174235115520 2017-09-18 00:04:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk Bahahaha GREAT!
909930578732077061 2017-09-18 00:02:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff @dukkiller9 "Killary" how profound Marlon, Fake News much? Which is your fav? Faux News, Info Wars, Breitbart or Daily Caller??? You cool with Treason?
909929731956645888 2017-09-18 23:58:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @daveweigel @DanRiffle @melseyiniowa @sqrlybear Iowa does seem really pretty bad for some reason.
909929597499830272 2017-09-18 23:58:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @daveweigel @DanRiffle @melseyiniowa I call McConnell's local office because they answer the phone there-almost never in DC!!!
909928563574558720 2017-09-18 23:54:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @InlawsOutlaws @DanRiffle Well McConnell's sure as hell did, I can attest to that!!!
909926016545644544 2017-09-18 23:44:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @dukkiller9 As if we care Marlon Are you proud of your man trump? He's just great & he's really making things better here too.

909924950521327617 2017-09-18 23:39:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @FloridaGOP @Pk9D4SRbxbd8zq5 @funder @stengel_jim Well, I live in KY so... It's just the Texas politicians that are so gross starting with Cruz. Austin is nice.
909923275995848705 2017-09-18 23:33:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @gibsondunn @BoutrousTed @LeahLitman @PublicCounsel @tribelaw And we're ALL VERY THANKFUL THAT YOU DO.
909922703334871041 2017-09-18 23:30:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @grahmgriff Yes, that's painfully clear isn't it.  Our govt really needs a major over haul.
909922069026091009 2017-09-18 23:28:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @WesSmith123 Manafort for $$$100.
909921753295712257 2017-09-18 23:27:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProgressOutlook I really can't stand McConnell.
909921341410865152 2017-09-18 23:25:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Lock Him Up!
909920437605470215 2017-09-18 23:21:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff I have ZERO respect for Republicans in Congress at this point. ZERO.
909918309650456576 2017-09-18 23:13:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump I don't believe your statement entirely. Some Dems did vote for trump & will vote for Dems again. ESP after this.
909900135823486977 2017-09-18 22:01:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @FloridaGOP @Pk9D4SRbxbd8zq5 @funder @stengel_jim Yes sorry but Texas is officially my least favorite state. So Damn Red.
909894934177751040 2017-09-18 21:40:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @jfreewright I'm pretty sure Mid East Peace is more likely.
909893204618743809 2017-09-18 21:33:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @yashar The more I hear, the happier I am that I did not watch the stupid show.
909854547941711873 2017-09-18 19:00:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @JackPosobiec @GenFlynn @StacyBrewer18 @patsyseverson What a joke. Where was/is the Right's loyalty to Sen McCain, McConnell, Ryan? You all have the loyalty of an alley cat.
909841703158386688 2017-09-18 18:09:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @JackPosobiec @GenFlynn @StacyBrewer18 By "thus"
909841502137982977 2017-09-18 18:08:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @GenFlynn I hope you get NOTHING, you traitor.
909817901397549056 2017-09-18 16:34:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @zachbraff @WhatsSleepTho @well_deb No, not as long as our Democracy is at stake. No.
909817548266463232 2017-09-18 16:33:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @shiftedshaped @zachbraff DITO ZACH. PRETTY DURE I WON'T EVER BE READY.
909815941684449281 2017-09-18 16:26:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @kelkelsc @KarenKYteacher It's not rational, IMO. I think yrs of Fake News about her. So many believe she's actually been involved in murders. So Cray Cray.
909804189173391360 2017-09-18 15:39:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @kelkelsc @KarenKYteacher Bet he totally hated Obama. I never realized how racist so many Americans are.
909803166077775873 2017-09-18 15:35:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @kelkelsc @KarenKYteacher Figured. Thanks to Fox etc, many have turned on mcconnell/Ryan. Blame them for everything. Ok with me but hardly fair!
909802537137704961 2017-09-18 15:33:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @kelkelsc @KarenKYteacher Does that mean he's a trump supporter as well?
909801896306774016 2017-09-18 15:30:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @DianeKovacs Wow sorry to hear it.
909800677723041799 2017-09-18 15:25:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @bill_auclair He is one weird crook.
909800425674739712 2017-09-18 15:24:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @mdhelfenbein What school let's that slide? Wow, that's really awful, even for Alabama!
909795865728077825 2017-09-18 15:06:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @kelkelsc @KarenKYteacher Well, I will be working to help try and make it happen! You in?
909794862811242496 2017-09-18 15:02:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @kelkelsc @KarenKYteacher I sometimes allow myself to hope that things will get SO bad that we will get rid of his sorry ass but lots of $$$ says no.
909784808368279552 2017-09-18 14:22:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @JCTheResistance @CrewDog281 She lost with a whole lot of help to lose. Putin & Comey & the media sure as hell did their parts to help her lose. NOT A FAIR FIGHT AT ALL.
909782979228168193 2017-09-18 14:15:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @viacampmimi @JCTheResistance Totally in, no matter who it ends up being. She/He will be at least 90% better than trump.
909782401336922112 2017-09-18 14:13:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @kelkelsc I will call but "my Senator" is McConnell. I only call because I'm sure he doesn't like to hear the #'s of "NO" calls. Not that he cares.
909780706766856192 2017-09-18 14:06:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @dylanlscott Yea, when I call McConnell's office, they say, "you've called here before haven't you"?
909772121806659584 2017-09-18 13:32:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @smartflexin @notquitefaust @mybellavino @FCJayBird No

909589060494217216 2017-09-17 01:25:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Does too little too late sound about right? I guess this is why Dems believe in regulations-so it's not just to make business more difficult
909587559491219456 2017-09-17 01:19:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @TUSK81 Really who made that call? It sure didn't work for me.
909580747224297472 2017-09-17 00:52:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @Moondragon_1 @AgentCarter_SSR @77CaptainMarvel @avilaem99 I mean ffs she's not even a teacher.

909572898473611264 2017-09-17 00:20:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @AnnOngByrne @TheoQualls Bahahaha should have known you go to UK.
909570414573232128 2017-09-17 00:11:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @AnnOngByrne @TheoQualls Says the guy with no shirt looking like a total nut job in twitter pic. Very meaningful coming from you.
909569542933925888 2017-09-17 00:07:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @Moondragon_1 @AgentCarter_SSR @77CaptainMarvel Money, that's how. They have a whole lot and they bought the position.
909567547934199808 2017-09-17 23:59:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepCummings @pattibarfield Oh god yes, no doubt about it.
909564509584592898 2017-09-17 23:47:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @FloridaGOP @Pk9D4SRbxbd8zq5 @funder @stengel_jim Why should Florida be any different from any other GOP state?
909519901408288768 2017-09-17 20:50:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @viacampmimi @funder He's a lying crook who colluded with Russia. If you think that's it?
909519307914309632 2017-09-17 20:47:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @JasonCrowCO6 Look at that they look like real live people you'd see just anywhere-I like it a lot.
909518875045318657 2017-09-17 20:46:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrettArends @davidfrum Her face says it all.
909518758569549825 2017-09-17 20:45:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrettArends @davidfrum He definitely does that totally checking out thing. Losing the car, missing other leaders taking pics at G-20 etc. #NotNormal
909517802935083009 2017-09-17 20:41:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @pattibarfield @tariqnasheed Yea they've been at it for quite awhile I'd say.
909456916891492352 2017-09-17 16:40:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @WomanMDsGuide @ananavarro Ana, you are way too honest to be GOP. You're much more Mod Dem at this point. The Racist Rs don't want you but we do. Give it some thought.
909454528705175554 2017-09-17 16:30:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @KateCello @tribelaw Yes, except this actually contained people's personal voting information. World's Realest Twilight Zone episode continues. Wake Up America.
909448641441607680 2017-09-17 16:07:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @KatyTurNBC She's cute. Is she your baby?
909447898898804737 2017-09-17 16:04:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlreiner @mindofamisfit1 @celeb_voices He's still sharp.
909446163606261760 2017-09-17 15:57:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @LindaWildes Yea, Paul Ryan is a wolf in sheep's clothing. His big doe eyes fighting for the Oligarchs of the world while pretending to be an alter boy.
909429016364486656 2017-09-17 14:49:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @mindofamisfit1 @Cernovich Hell No.
909427944099065856 2017-09-17 14:44:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @mindofamisfit1 @JulianSvendsen Hell No!!!
909426724181508096 2017-09-17 14:40:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @DianeKovacs @DerekCressman I think you mean...His next pound of flesh.
909425281496174593 2017-09-17 14:34:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind This isn't funny, it's just wrong. And if you find it funny, then you are just wrong.
909413836729589760 2017-09-17 13:48:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk @waltshaub @fukercarlson I don't nec see it that way. What is the "unusual activity" on your account?
909412858877874177 2017-09-17 13:44:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk @waltshaub @fukercarlson Or not.
909411676092604418 2017-09-17 13:40:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk @waltshaub @fukercarlson What is this supposed to mean? Walter has done way more than most for this country.
909407527573626882 2017-09-17 13:23:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scotttaylorva Saw you on MSNBC. You're full of crap. Trying to avoid discussing trump's ridiculous tweets? You should be ashamed.
909406982775492608 2017-09-17 13:21:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @jenn_theflower @paulitically @demIN240 @WhiskeyMD247365 And yet all of the stupid/hateful/ worthless stuff that trump said meant nothing. Tells you exactly who voted for him doesn't it?
909406282477637632 2017-09-17 13:18:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @paulitically @weathergirl49 @Gabbiedrice78K @WhiskeyMD247365 Please hold your breath on that John.
909406039056973825 2017-09-17 13:17:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @jenn_theflower @paulitically @WhiskeyMD247365 What a stupid statement. Becoming the first female president is a "one foot putt" because there have been so many other female presidents.
909402550146871301 2017-09-17 13:03:58 UTC <HenslerKate> Not mentally ill, are you? Do you actually think I care what your "followers" think of me? "Neuroscientist" that's a good one.
909401107356688384 2017-09-17 12:58:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @fawfulfan @vavrek_james @Shareblue Well yea, Heritage Foundation was part of it, of course. "Heritage" of white haters.
909397980360278016 2017-09-17 12:45:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Fuctupmind Sicko dude who has to cover his face to post crap.
909397776546586625 2017-09-17 12:45:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @MyraDSirois1 @Fuctupmind This is sick. You find this funny? No wonder you support dolt 45.
909396250188972032 2017-09-17 12:38:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 @WellProbably @MarkAbt12 What are you talking about?
909390637354676224 2017-09-17 12:16:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @WellProbably @ddale8 Republicans are crooks who routinely sell their votes to the highest bidders.
909389392346779658 2017-09-17 12:11:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @NatashaBertrand Nice :(
909387678516486145 2017-09-17 12:04:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Vote For The Dem. RepubliKlans are racist haters who only care about themselves. Vote for the Party of We, not the Party of Me.
909384267540631558 2017-09-17 11:51:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw And those #'s do not include all of the cheating that went on for trump.
909380994318422016 2017-09-17 11:38:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @USATODAY Fine give Cassidy/Graham that crap care.
909380084057985025 2017-09-17 11:34:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @stengel_jim She's So Gross.
909378923267596290 2017-09-17 11:30:05 UTC <HenslerKate> Totally serious. Also serious, you're a nasty hater. Bet you'll cry the day your leader is impeached 
909262904071000064 2017-09-16 03:49:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @LauraLoomer Laura you are a mean hater. Are you still loving trump? Bahahaha
909255258202939393 2017-09-16 03:18:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @cbouzy @nola24073693 What do you mean?
909253744096894977 2017-09-16 03:12:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @cbouzy Really, I'm so tired of that bullshit. People always saying it didn't change the outcome of the election. Of course it did!
909219345372516352 2017-09-16 00:55:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @WSJopinion @LindseyGrahamSC And your pitch for this was a total joke too!
909219155961892864 2017-09-16 00:55:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @WSJopinion @LindseyGrahamSC This Sucks! You take it as your deathcare plan!!!
909218945009438721 2017-09-16 00:54:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC You should be so ashamed of yourself for this BS deathcare program. I used to think you were better than many other Rs. I was SO wrong.
909217181690363904 2017-09-16 00:47:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @jfdavisspeaks @Freeyourmindkid These people are really awful. They're busy passing laws that make this ok too. SICK,
909216431874756609 2017-09-16 00:44:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @mshopemac @ClintSmithIII It's really crazy but that's sadly true.
909212078510141440 2017-09-16 00:27:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepMaxineWaters @cmclymer @leannxjh @accidntlmystic Yes I agree but she seems to enjoy being on tv and her Twitter following as well. I think she's great!
909210802380574721 2017-09-16 00:22:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepMaxineWaters @cmclymer @accidntlmystic @leannxjh Me too, What's not to like? She's enjoying her celebrity :)
909159242057371649 2017-09-16 20:57:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer Total Bull.
909136248123613184 2017-09-16 19:25:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila Yea it's super creepy. It's like a bad movie script has taken over our government.
909107497377640453 2017-09-16 17:31:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @LocoDev Yea well Louisville has a good Dem Mayor and Rep Yarmouth is good that's about it:(
909105900580896768 2017-09-16 17:25:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @LocoDev Guess trump thought only blacks would understand subsidized housing. Something is very off with Carson.
909081726055600129 2017-09-16 15:49:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RedTRaccoon @ellensable1995 She does often behave as though she's in a hostage situation.
909081390540627970 2017-09-16 15:47:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @mshopemac @UMichFootball Thanks!

908713500746436613 2017-09-15 15:25:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @jewishright Man you're a special kind of stupid. You don't like trump any more do now you want bannon? And you're Jewish? Sad.
908668401157107720 2017-09-15 12:26:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @jmartNYT Pretty sure McConnell hates trump as much as Progressives do. He's getting exactly what he deserves. ENJOY!!!
908667753191665664 2017-09-15 12:24:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @fukercarlson @AHamiltonSpirit I really rarely look at Facebook anyway. I'm totally in!!!
908666915664662529 2017-09-15 12:20:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @HoneyDemForce Gross. Thanks trump, you idiot. Coal sludge is gross. I say we dump it all at Mar-A-Lago.
908666573858201601 2017-09-15 12:19:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger Also, he's appointed a whole lot of snakes.
908663278401982464 2017-09-15 12:06:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @mikefarb1 @colorpoetry And donate to help keep his work going!!!
908662244174712833 2017-09-15 12:02:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @laurenduca The words sex and Ted Cruz should not be in the same sentence.
908661683333287936 2017-09-15 12:00:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedTRaccoon @PopupProtests @3cutebabies @DeniseGundelfi1 Olive was a scratcher, not pleasant.
908657849160609792 2017-09-15 11:44:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedTRaccoon @PopupProtests @DeniseGundelfi1 @3cutebabies We had a black cat once. She was a cat who attacked at will & it was very random. You could be onto something.
908656627460575232 2017-09-15 11:39:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @InertAlien @TinaMoo58291603 You trust insurance companies & big pharma? Not all of us are so afraid of our govt.
908655283278360576 2017-09-15 11:34:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Yes it would be just terrible to have good affordable healthcare like every other civilized country in the world. Donny, why so DUMB?
908654474926977024 2017-09-15 11:31:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @dreamcatcher5 @BruceBourgoine Really, I never would have guessed.
908652275366715392 2017-09-15 11:22:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @alaskarebel Mr & Mrs Swamp Thing. They seem to deserve one another.
908539933677068288 2017-09-14 03:56:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedTRaccoon Wow I don't think I could. What do you think motivated his vote?
908538557991608322 2017-09-14 03:50:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA I'm pretty sure pathological lying is a prerequisite for this admin.
908528832969416704 2017-09-14 03:12:08 UTC <HenslerKate> I'm retired and a grandma (of a little doll) and I'm calling trump a White Supremacist.
908523917043802112 2017-09-14 02:52:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @GlzgowlassLaing @JodyDelBrocco Wow, that's really amazing.
908523043647098881 2017-09-14 02:49:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind At best, they know the can't trust our govt. That's really bad for us and for the world.
908520512598499328 2017-09-14 02:39:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Yea, it's not worth the paper it's written on.
908516447978180608 2017-09-14 02:22:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum By "very conservative person" in reference to Sessions do you really mean he's a racist & a liar?
908512740951683072 2017-09-14 02:08:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @DerekCressman @KneadALaugh I'm not really convinced that he's outstanding Con Man/Grifter. I just think he's willing to do anything to win. He's NOT  a good Liar.
908511056091328514 2017-09-14 02:01:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @DerekCressman I remember when I used to be surprised by just how stupid he is but really any more, I just expect it. That's really very sad.
908504607164391426 2017-09-14 01:35:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper A 'real man' who's a total dirt ball.
908502945741905920 2017-09-14 01:29:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You have lost your mind.
908502850950623232 2017-09-14 01:28:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Great job on TRMS tonight. You should be our President but instead we have dumb don. So many of us will always be with you.
908500749394595841 2017-09-14 01:20:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @maddow @peterdaou Every word true too.
908500412294156293 2017-09-14 01:19:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @MatManz But I do agree with her. She's smart and knowledgeable and in control. She's everything that trump is not.
908489952912175104 2017-09-14 00:37:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellreports @PaulSparks3 So are brains.
908489098280751104 2017-09-14 00:34:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow @mitchellreports He's a bad joke. Sure wish we had a real SOS.
908485956784787456 2017-09-14 00:21:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow @RealMikeWilbon America is with her too.
908476668712452096 2017-09-14 23:44:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuddLegum @questlove This must not be allowed to happen.
908474356728287232 2017-09-14 23:35:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterMerlinCane @ShaunKing Wow that's sick.
908466259716648961 2017-09-14 23:03:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @jackiecall3 @davidaxelrod Yes strange but far from his worst (which is really sad)
908462649423392768 2017-09-14 22:49:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @BettyBowers She's there to try and keep him a bit more settled-VERY TOUGH JOB.
908462360553238528 2017-09-14 22:47:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @stjoedemocrats @PeteButtigieg @sethmoulton Both of you guys rock-wish I could see you both!
908459661636009984 2017-09-14 22:37:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mediaite Oh god it's Jason in the outhouse. Gross, gross, gross.

908357940561760256 2017-09-14 15:53:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Trump is Putin's pick. He was NOT ELECTED by the American People. He must be removed from office.
908347822629703682 2017-09-14 15:12:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger @veryfrank10 Poor Frank, Better Get Used to it, it only gets worse from here. You actually believed that Con Man, WOW, SAD!!!

908345133241954305 2017-09-14 15:02:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP He's so dumb he doesn't know they already are the obstructionists 
908320793431506945 2017-09-14 13:25:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @KSchroeder_312 Bahahaha
908320473901084672 2017-09-14 13:24:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier @TheRickWilson God yes, it's all a bloody lie. Well except for the Alt Right hatred crap.
908314175214166017 2017-09-14 12:59:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 God yes, it's antiquated bullshit.
908314002480095233 2017-09-14 12:58:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @WellProbably @dean_geno Yes many of us are. Those white people who voted HRC for sure.

908311331836776448 2017-09-14 12:47:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs Well yes, but that too takes time. Don the Con will be busy pardoning everyone that he can. State level works I know.
908310447920730112 2017-09-14 12:44:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @PACforPOWER @KimWeaverIA Hope all is well Kim.
908309816065626112 2017-09-14 12:41:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs Well I don't think we have any choice. It's really our only hope. The Rs in charge are complicit. They will not vote him out no matter what.

908305393906053125 2017-09-14 12:24:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs We must take the house to get rid of the dolt.

908162521894400005 2017-09-13 02:56:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @joey_girardi Yes we will impeach the orange A Hole, don't you worry!
908161897236762625 2017-09-13 02:54:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @sweetatertot2 How are you like trump's white supremacist view and actions. You're very light skinned but you're black enough for him to mistreat.
908160901177585665 2017-09-13 02:50:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump China's corporate is 25%. You're a dolt.
908160494523088897 2017-09-13 02:48:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RealEagleBites Oh yes should we begin paying people like they do in China? The sweat shops that sew Ivanka's cheap clothes and pay workers .50$ a day.
908159675786555392 2017-09-13 02:45:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Oh no it's old man hater in young man's body. How goes your legal battle?
908134445336625152 2017-09-13 01:04:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @Evan_McMullin No Evan, we can not. Our healthcare is the MOST expensive in the world & it is far from the best. It needs to be completely reworked. Deal.
908132831511052293 2017-09-13 00:58:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @proffitt_marcia @MSNBC This was pretty funny & it was obvious Chuck thought so too.

908091421701365760 2017-09-13 22:14:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Completely Ridiculous. It should have been enough to keep him from running. Just that single issue should have been enough. Racist Rump.
908075612627238912 2017-09-13 21:11:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper Less & less a Democracy every single day. Wake up people, it's really bad.

908074603616067584 2017-09-13 21:07:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @wmbo It's the same LOSERS that want to  taxes for the 1%, fuel racism, pollution, kill govt, & be buds with Russia, that say guns for all.

907617248751312896 2017-09-12 14:49:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mikel_Jollett I totally agree. Many feel threatened by strong independent women.

906964279676600320 2017-09-10 19:35:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @inafried @waltshaub @Madmork Marketing my ass. Conspiring with Russia is not marketing. It's bold faced cheating, many times over. And they hacked voting machines, too!

906846924317347840 2017-09-10 11:48:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @axios @NatashaBertrand @tenax666 Yes and at his core, what he cares about are the 1% problems. Lowing taxes, screwing poor people and  regs on industry. Don't believe it.
906747004696633344 2017-09-09 05:11:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @nbc @Varidienne No way. Did they hire Chris Christie?
906741773199912961 2017-09-09 04:50:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @Pan19591 @michaelianblack Only when it costs them money. They "believed" in the eclipse.
906737817539289088 2017-09-09 04:35:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @Bcar1960 I'll agree with that but he was the only one that wasn't awful so that's not saying much.
906737019719741441 2017-09-09 04:32:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @JanetMarino8 That's right just because he can put two words together dies not mean he's acceptable. 1950's are over, thank you.

906500891729121281 2017-09-09 12:53:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @ellensilver3 Man that's really gross. Just gross. He should have thrown in a prayer and charged 200$

906266943103086592 2017-09-08 21:24:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Yea it's "unpresidented" all right!

906237331446915072 2017-09-08 19:26:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier Freedom Caucus? Freedom to be a complete A Hole.
906211796050161670 2017-09-08 17:45:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @goprapebuster No really just money and power, which they equate with money. No wonder they tend to be nasty.
906180041377185793 2017-09-08 15:38:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @hgurdon Saw you on Faux News. Are you related to Gorka? You seem to have same Faux Accent? Cousins perhaps?
906179637608411137 2017-09-08 15:37:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @hgurdon Saw y

906171314850942976 2017-09-08 15:04:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @WilDonnelly Gross why do everyday Americans keep voting for those Crooks?
906170382356553728 2017-09-08 15:00:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @JRubinBlogger As a woman I should think you would respect HRC right to vent about a very unfair political process but then you are a Republican aren't you
906169540316364800 2017-09-08 14:57:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @sahilkapur Do you think that colluding with Russia & Russian propaganda makes for a fair fight. They cheated every way they could. Screw You Bud.
906157197410914304 2017-09-08 14:08:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @WestCoYoungDems @KneadALaugh @sdavis1133 He was one of the very worst, IMO.
906157013520052224 2017-09-08 14:07:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @WestCoYoungDems Bahahaha no surprise there. How sad.
906149839376928768 2017-09-08 13:38:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Just on business dealings and lack of tax returns, trump was clearly far less transparent and that info is still not public. Cons are Cons.
906149381954568193 2017-09-08 13:37:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Exactly. The media in trying to be "fair" bent over backwards to give "equal" coverage but the candidates were in no way "equal".
906144850843721728 2017-09-08 13:19:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @sassygayrepub @aislinntlc @mopargirl_426 I've done that. Answers are not coherent or rational. They did not do their homework & fell for simple platitudes. Faux News watchers suck.
906144414724214784 2017-09-08 13:17:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @sassygayrepub @mopargirl_426 That's ridiculous. If our attitudes meant anything the morons would not have made him #45. His voters do not care about facts/reality.
906142940023713792 2017-09-08 13:11:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC So true. And sadly, so many did cont to support him. It's a very telling thing in a very disturbing way.
906136871390064640 2017-09-08 12:47:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @titeman50 Sick stuff.
906136726078443520 2017-09-08 12:46:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie @BenSasse Ben you're not nearly the man you seem to think you are. And trump is NOT a Dem. Dem's don't vote for Dolts. Cons do!
906128872919457794 2017-09-08 12:15:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @pwnallthethings Wrong again. That's when DNC emails mysteriously released-2 hours later. You're really not very good at this!
906128547865120768 2017-09-08 12:14:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @pwnallthethings Wrong. That was Rudy & NY FBI.
906128166556762112 2017-09-08 12:12:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @pwnallthethings Yea you're wrong. Really it doesn't matter bc the Russians had already worked their magic by then. So Much Cheating!
906125591379943425 2017-09-08 12:02:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump And all of the Cons would be SO incensed. They'd be on every channel screaming that "justice" must be served.
905982236918468608 2017-09-07 02:32:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer Good, let's capitalize on it shall we?
905962778007138304 2017-09-07 01:15:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @Elviraafterthot @4everNeverTrump No Doubt About It. This is such a bad joke. The Cons have lost all & any credibility they ever had. They must be excised from our govt.
905961733767954432 2017-09-07 01:11:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProudResister B. A Mobster.
905961054848548865 2017-09-07 01:08:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @viacampmimi @bluelyon She got so screwed by a bunch of crooks who cheated with the Russians to steal the presidency. She can tell like she sees it. She's due that
905957420060553217 2017-09-07 00:54:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @kak089 @funder @BetsyOShea It was Elizabeth Warren. (Are u serious)?
905923687836241920 2017-09-07 22:40:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrumpDefined Jevanka is GROSS.
905903046957420545 2017-09-07 21:18:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald Dems know that we must stand together and that's what we will do. We need some younger folks to unify our base & we have plenty to do that.
905902360857387008 2017-09-07 21:15:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald I don't see the Dems as nearly as divided as the Cons. At least we are on the same continuum. Try bringing Paul & Graham together.
905901373925064704 2017-09-07 21:11:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald Wow, that's a look. And Faux Men don't respect the women on that channel? What a surprise 
905899744379232262 2017-09-07 21:05:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix Gee, it's almost like he sending dumb-dumb jr a message.
905818409816002560 2017-09-07 15:41:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @AGSchneiderman You make us smile Eric. Many of us appreciate your strength and commitment to justice.
905817944386568194 2017-09-07 15:40:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattliptoncomic Twitter winner in my book.
905817765642199044 2017-09-07 15:39:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Wouldn't you know, the room is tacky :)
905780984913776640 2017-09-07 13:13:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @JetBlue @Helenhs Meanwhile Delta is doing the exact opposite.
905780122309074944 2017-09-07 13:09:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul Reinforce that they are not our friends and that they can not be trusted (to the Cons of course). Also Faux News is Fake News.
905605097194971138 2017-09-06 01:34:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You don't hire and grow in America and neither does a Ivanka. You're only good at lying and being a hypocrite.
905604552673566721 2017-09-06 01:32:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr @justinhendrix Yea can't imagine any other real scenario.
905600870867501056 2017-09-06 01:17:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Creampuffgal @BillKristol Yes a deal with the devil never ends well.
905562072808861697 2017-09-06 22:43:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProudResister No I didn't say that FB was the only guilty party here. I'm just saying, they weren't "innocent" either.
905550586657026048 2017-09-06 21:57:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProudResister Normally I agree with you however on this one I do not. Facebook should have better judgement than selling ad space to our advisories.
905476732047806464 2017-09-06 17:04:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff I have great respect for you sir but the Dems need to get out there and lead their party against those crooks. FIRE WITH FIRE ALREADY!
905444001620402176 2017-09-06 14:54:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT He's a twisted twerp isn't he!
905430166947733504 2017-09-06 13:59:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven @AmandiOnAir Man that's sick.
905429193294577666 2017-09-06 13:55:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @alta247 @Trumpfan1995 @tgatorguy It's the Cons who can't pass anything-guess you know that right?
905428393004544000 2017-09-06 13:52:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @Trumpfan1995 @lauriedenn23 No it speaks to the Republicans in Congress incompetence.
905428075676098560 2017-09-06 13:50:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @Trumpfan1995 @faagifts This is dumb-you probably need "your SSI :(
905427754493108224 2017-09-06 13:49:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @snowflake_miner @Trumpfan1995 When you put the #MAGA crap on there-it kind of slants the response. But of course you knew that, right?
905230394550833152 2017-09-05 00:45:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @DrJillStein Yes, is this an apology for supporting trump over Hillary? If not, save your worthless words Dr.

905106071861243904 2017-09-05 16:31:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven @Susan_Hennessey Really all talk No action sucks.
905104063724969985 2017-09-05 16:23:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @PersuasivePR @VicenteFoxQue So Very True.
905047728044072961 2017-09-05 12:39:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @KatiePavlich Independent Faux News Contributor? Sure, like that's an actual thing.
905035861691072512 2017-09-05 11:52:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul Tillerson is a joke. As is his State Dept. Sorry but this has clear from day one. It was and is only about the oil.
905030339210477568 2017-09-05 11:30:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @angiedam2 Wait, wasn't Susan Sarandon a Bernie Supporter?
904868451034030081 2017-09-04 00:47:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul Not if you're into "Deconstructing the Admin State" This is not normal and it's dangerous to our Democracy.
904801905901232128 2017-09-04 20:22:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @verrit @NMc_NorCal @ikatsume Yea she did beat trump and he clearly cheated like a MFer so there's that.
904789662639812608 2017-09-04 19:34:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @dawnresist @vertigo7804 I blame them more. Not too long ago I actually believed they had at least some integrity. But since then, it's become clear they have 0.
904769082523832323 2017-09-04 18:12:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Sad how many union members voted for the crook.
904732340127240194 2017-09-04 15:46:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro Tell that to your party Ana.
904731959083114496 2017-09-04 15:44:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Happy to say I'm hearing of more and more ex-Rs. Not because of DACA but because of trump.
904729408396722178 2017-09-04 15:34:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA And they shouldn't.
904461951375474690 2017-09-03 21:51:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheAaronColyer @TeaPainUSA @taylorbunnag @elizabethecarte No he would have impeached him for sure.
904419816882176003 2017-09-03 19:04:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @kurteichenwald Yea challenge your billionaire friends to a check writing duo. Maybe you can get your Oligarch friends to kick in some rubles?
904419349435428865 2017-09-03 19:02:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @MichelleObama @BarackObama @impeach_d_trump So very much.
904338515781148672 2017-09-03 13:41:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT @realButterworth 2D? Please Keep Fishing.
904338057264062464 2017-09-03 13:39:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT We no longer believe in experts. Only experts in Deconstructing the Administrative State :(
904331649692962816 2017-09-03 13:14:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila And just as they kept mum about trump the Mobster running/winning they cont to sit back & watch & say nothing. 2018, get them the hell out.
904183784064602113 2017-09-02 03:26:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @GailRNJD @GideonResnick Not so sure the use of "amazing" works here. I'd say more like Deeply Disturbing.
904182844372733953 2017-09-02 03:22:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Oh We Will Most Certainly be Watching.
904163507138158592 2017-09-02 02:05:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @DerekCressman Ummmm yep!
904162766138769410 2017-09-02 02:02:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jayge26 @tribelaw Oh no. She's much worse because at least Spicey seemed to have some difficulty with lying. NOT SHS.
904151811388473344 2017-09-02 01:19:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @perlmutations Behold the nasty trump effect. "I'm a total asshole and I'm damn proud of it"
904150889623105536 2017-09-02 01:15:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrumpDefined Oh My God, This Is The Worst.!
904149131568046080 2017-09-02 01:08:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill Wow the shit just never stops.
904092314162913281 2017-09-02 21:22:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @InlawsOutlaws @tonyschwartz Me either.
903956322126848000 2017-09-02 12:22:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @rmecheeya @JoeNBC Well then consider the GOP Cons very, very, very tarnished Joe 
903954361855987712 2017-09-02 12:14:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee Mike you need to start praying 24/7!!!
903826323256340480 2017-09-01 03:46:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @Amy_Siskind Bahahaha No Way.
903807761749770240 2017-09-01 02:32:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @NathanLerner I don't think they're afraid of trump any more. It's his nasty ass base they're afraid of. They sold themselves out to trash. ReapWhatYouSow
903807119601934340 2017-09-01 02:29:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @NathanLerner @bogucki_john Wouldn't surprise me one little bit John. God knows they've used lots of rubles to support themselves.
903595104535019520 2017-09-01 12:27:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @KrisKobach1787 @JasonKander So Gross. These people really are the worst.
903594515407175681 2017-09-01 12:24:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas It's bad, but not nearly as bad as trump himself is.
903592681552695296 2017-09-01 12:17:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato He's So Damn Bad!!!
903590655074676736 2017-09-01 12:09:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @impeach_d_trump TOTALLY!!!
903590498660700160 2017-09-01 12:08:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Wow, looks like DJT is not only a totally worthless president,he's a totally worthless person. You hate her so much bc you know (NO) she won
903588298551123968 2017-09-01 12:00:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepScottTaylor And yet you "support" a president who never mentioned their names. That's gross of both of you! (Going down with the ship)
903587876981628929 2017-09-01 11:58:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepScottTaylor BS. "Identity politics pushed from the left mostly"???Joking??Trump has maligned hispanics,blacks, women,Muslims,poor people
903585942488875009 2017-09-01 11:50:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @OhNoSheTwitnt Bahahaha mine too PLEASE!!!
903585603996012546 2017-09-01 11:49:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou If I hear one more person call trump a Dem. No folks, Dems actually care about real people. Trump is definitely a Republican Now!!!
903585017049337856 2017-09-01 11:47:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro More than time. Trump will cont to taint his party! Which is fine with me. The Cons are a very selfish lot.
903407133756153856 2017-08-31 00:00:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepDeSantis Hey Ron, Remember Benghazi and all of the email crap that = 0? You can stick it with your "accountability"! Trump's totally DIRTY-Deal.
903235963283017728 2017-08-31 12:40:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @jojoh888 @Bae64 Yes it's the Alt-Right folks who love & respect Blacks. Give me a break, that's just dumb.
903235382485151744 2017-08-31 12:37:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @ElijahEOkon @jojoh888 Well this is some sad bullshit. If you can't decide between the Dems and the Alt-Right Cons you've got a serious problem. We are trying!
903232948895440896 2017-08-31 12:28:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @mokojumbee @peterdaou No kidding! I'd say RW Media has had a huge role in tainting many minds in this country. We must improve this. Fox News=Faux News (et al).
903227302523392004 2017-08-31 12:05:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @stevenmnuchin1 @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @CaseyHinds @DianeDi79941099 @MacLikin @glitterandbokeh You're crazy.
903115217067966469 2017-08-30 04:40:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato Do doubt about it. He's so transparent. Grassley is so past his prime. Too sad old geezers.
902989583566155777 2017-08-30 20:21:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @THP1640 @BillPascrell So completely out of wack. Same old "conservative" bullshit. It has never worked except for very rich people.
902988549557014529 2017-08-30 20:17:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @4everNeverTrump There's a lot of that.
902945657455030274 2017-08-30 17:26:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato He is so GROSS. How does anybody buy his line of bull??? Hope this costs him a whole lot of money.
902944929307033602 2017-08-30 17:23:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ProgressOutlook @DrainOurSwamp I suspect you probably do know a lot about "cantering" however.
902944424690364417 2017-08-30 17:21:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ProgressOutlook @DrainOurSwamp Yes you support trump the ultimate hater & I'm the one full of hate. That's rich. Whoever convinced you that all liberals were snowflakes?
902940549006708736 2017-08-30 17:06:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ProgressOutlook @DrainOurSwamp Consider me whatever you like. I'm just being honest, clearly something you do not value as a trump supporter.
902930090467708928 2017-08-30 16:24:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ProgressOutlook @DrainOurSwamp Your BS runs deep. I am not your friend.
902929745691672576 2017-08-30 16:23:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance Yea they're gross and they're losing.
902929222347390977 2017-08-30 16:21:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ProgressOutlook @DrainOurSwamp Bahahaha in other words, you've got nothing, Zero, zippo in the win column. 2018 is going to be very painful for you winners!!!
902919541277249537 2017-08-30 15:42:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @SeanMcElwee No Shit.
902918771773407238 2017-08-30 15:39:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ProgressOutlook @DrainOurSwamp Winning? Healthcare? Taxes? Wall? ISIS?  Which is your favorite?
902904313017753601 2017-08-30 14:42:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyraDSirois1 @davidshepardson Don't forget sucked up to a sycophant Governor!

902901885144793088 2017-08-30 14:32:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @GeorgeTakei ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Ivanka proves false hope is actually worse than no hope.
902901434324324353 2017-08-30 14:30:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ProgressOutlook @DrainOurSwamp Proud part of the "PROBLEM". #RESIST.
902900960233652225 2017-08-30 14:28:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @Amy_Siskind He couldn't speak for 3 minutes on tax reform. It's another "Aren't I GREAT MAGA FEST" If he comes to KY again, I'll be the one thrown out.
902900289921003521 2017-08-30 14:26:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @dumptrump33 @DinaHonour I suspect people have told him but he really only trusts himself. Not a good thing in a president. It's like the climate deniers.
902898898036981761 2017-08-30 14:20:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @dumptrump33 As if he had anything relevant to say. "For my encore, I'll be pardoning my son next week"
902890641457340417 2017-08-30 13:47:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenBlumenthal Don't trust Grassley!!!
902889937187598337 2017-08-30 13:45:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @77CaptainMarvel @EricLiptonNYT Wow. Guess he has criminal loose ends to tie up in OK. Maybe a few guilty as shit emails to hunt down?
902886991062290432 2017-08-30 13:33:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhitfordBradley @jonathanalter Can you imagine what the Rs would have done if BHO had tweeted this shit?
902886442569003009 2017-08-30 13:31:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @therealLAVALLEE @thehill Total Idiot.
902885798026018817 2017-08-30 13:28:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN So So So gross. I'd rather take safe harbor in a dumpster.
902885228439588870 2017-08-30 13:26:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @NBCNews He's so gross. I mean what is wrong with people? It's like 1/2 of American's BULLSHIT meters are completely BROKEN.
902884683435974657 2017-08-30 13:24:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT @alissakmclean All three make me sick! Among the worst.
902883999240114177 2017-08-30 13:21:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @exoticgamora I don't know but she does not looked scared to me. It's not her first death threat.
902882312920207360 2017-08-30 13:14:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA I mean she must have a screw loose. That's just CRAY CRAY.
902879829036601346 2017-08-30 13:05:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT This from the POTUS??? My God, we must do something before he gets a lot of Americans killed because of his stupidity. How low can we go?
902878227345133568 2017-08-30 12:58:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @SondraPendergr2 @American1stok Well I mean he's kicked ass on healthcare, taxes and the wall so the sky's the limit!
902877548513828864 2017-08-30 12:55:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC It's not a "compliment Congress" joe, it's a "complicit Congress" the Rs that is. STOP KIDDING YOURSELF. OWN IT.
902876744469929984 2017-08-30 12:52:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @WellProbably @JoyAnnReid Oh man, keep um coming!!!!
902876062463528960 2017-08-30 12:50:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @teenytinyflame @tinyhandspb Let me help you with that. Ryan will do absolutely NOTHING.
902875222919000064 2017-08-30 12:46:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @My2Sintz Parallels rise of Faux News.They've been dog whistling for years. Folks believe their crap. They (& others) must be held accountable. RESIST
902873401794195456 2017-08-30 12:39:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @GlennThrush @amb573 @Kay_Kay_Oh Honestly, why would chemist stay in MI for 2 yrs with no work? Not the only state in US. Real life? Move.
902872578678812672 2017-08-30 12:36:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @GlennThrush @AmyDoghouse @skmsw Exactly, which is why trump is now Pres
902872231835041792 2017-08-30 12:34:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @GlennThrush @boilerkevin Yes, it's unseemly at best.
902871912027709440 2017-08-30 12:33:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @GlennThrush Glenn I have been a fan but this right here is BS. Grow a pair and own the truth. Peter is right. We all fail now and again.
902870116928540674 2017-08-30 12:26:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @GlennThrush @mikiebarb @maggieNYT @peterdaou What a joke. "Scandal" meanwhile trump is busy trying to build a tower in Moscow. That's so wrong on every front. Thrush is losing it lately
902869001587621892 2017-08-30 12:21:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @LiberalResist Interesting and sad.I hope their home here in louisville meets with a horrific flood on one of the rare occasions that they're actually here
902865978924695552 2017-08-30 12:09:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @My2Sintz I don't think it's new. Rs have been racists for years. They've just been emboldened enough to be loud & proud about it. Reg citizens too :(
902865005401575424 2017-08-30 12:06:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @mrglenferris @My2Sintz Wait we have McConnell and Rand Russian Paul. Kentucky Wins, I mean loses :(
902864294316056576 2017-08-30 12:03:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @ACLU This is trump's America. #MAGA MY ASS.
902738285491040257 2017-08-29 03:42:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @Trump @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold DO NOT HOLD YOUR BREATH ON THAT ONE! He might throw in one of his new tacky hats.
902737511524466688 2017-08-29 03:39:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AliVelshi @shellyc42 If the shoe fits....tacky trump everything.
902732444658536448 2017-08-29 03:19:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @suejohnston56 @peterdaou @khwalz He's hilarious!
902722757196120064 2017-08-29 02:40:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @sonofavak No, they're on his campaign website along with MAGA hate & other crap he's hocking.
902705340063633408 2017-08-29 01:31:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @DianaMiller5 @KarenChestney He's so darn bad. Wish he'd stay in OK.
902704848826757121 2017-08-29 01:29:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @Keys_Gamarra @BeSeriousUSA @AdamParkhomenko Awesome! We so need more women in govt.
902702642597691392 2017-08-29 01:20:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 "Study" by "Experts" he must be a Dem?
902700432648273920 2017-08-29 01:12:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @SJLarson1 @GailRNJD @suesea_7 And I don't even believe it was a lie.I think he thought it was try and it ended up not always being true. Unlike trump's bold faced zingers
902680181357387777 2017-08-29 23:51:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterAlexander Sure.
902678922986446848 2017-08-29 23:46:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Good One Sarah. And also true.
902678700147257344 2017-08-29 23:45:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier @cmclymer They certain did offer some "gospel clarity" didn't they. Total trash right there.
902672781200027654 2017-08-29 23:22:16 UTC <HenslerKate> You want proof? Donald the Dolt is president.
902651770337456128 2017-08-29 21:58:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterPrunski @kfhall0852 Tomorrow he loves the crowd :(
902638818695811074 2017-08-29 21:07:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @perlmutations @shellyc42 Me too his voice literally makes my skin crawl. Conversely, when I even see a picture of Barack sometimes I tear up because I miss him.
902611753909018628 2017-08-29 19:19:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoelOsteen And?
902592481346428931 2017-08-29 18:03:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhitfordBradley @JuddApatow So that he could raise funds for his defense attorneys.
902590525529870336 2017-08-29 17:55:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @AndreaChalupa They are cute but my husband calls them over grown rats. They eat everything and they are dangerous bc they run across the streets a lot. :(
902589088724914176 2017-08-29 17:49:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer "Ethics" that left the day that music died.
902587465793490945 2017-08-29 17:43:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @mshopemac @axios I mean really, he's like your alcoholic uncle who always manages to leave a turd in the punch bowl.
902566121391489024 2017-08-29 16:18:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @thehill Too little, too late.
902553068344135681 2017-08-29 15:26:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder What a good Christian he is.
902548242470199297 2017-08-29 15:07:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaelianblack @rants_n_whatevs Or do!
902546388352937985 2017-08-29 15:00:02 UTC <HenslerKate> I just took a yoga class, I highly recommend you do too!
902544988663369729 2017-08-29 14:54:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Joe makes me sick but he has totally turned on trump since he outed Mika post face lift. Even Joe has his standards.
902544369240215552 2017-08-29 14:52:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 It's always just about the optics. To hell with those who are suffering.
902543706078806017 2017-08-29 14:49:22 UTC <HenslerKate> Hey Kay, Get a Clue Lady.
902541306723004417 2017-08-29 14:39:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @GlennThrush @maggieNYT Total BS, Glen this is beneath you.
902523604465831937 2017-08-29 13:29:30 UTC <HenslerKate> More like sold their souls to the devil, IMO.
902522153282752513 2017-08-29 13:23:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarionBurr5 @aravosis Oh, I thought that was a Ivanka but alas it's his second class wife.
902521545213530115 2017-08-29 13:21:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarionBurr5 @aravosis Oh now, she is rocking that army green jacket. He's as rude with his daughter as he is his wife. GROSS GUY.
902519778006446080 2017-08-29 13:14:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance @EricBoehlert Yea, here's the "pivot" we've all been waiting for AGAIN!
902512582631804928 2017-08-29 12:45:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @BettyBowers @tonietwjinteres @KatheleenMitro Yes I don't agree with change but I don't think it's much of a "change".
902509085274329088 2017-08-29 12:31:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub Thanks Walter. I always vote (in Ky ) and I will donate to CLC and write to congress. Sincere thanks for your efforts to right this ship.
902507347104456704 2017-08-29 12:24:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @BettyBowers @KatheleenMitro @tonietwjinteres That law is bull, they've been "weighing in" for a long time.
902507091457449985 2017-08-29 12:23:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @stengel_jim Bahahaha can you blame him? SAD!!!
902504853716566016 2017-08-29 12:14:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @costareports Lou seems as fake as trump. Hair, tan, teeth. Gross. Let's hope folks see the FAKE this time! Go Sen Casey-clean his fake two bit clock!
902503796009570304 2017-08-29 12:10:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub Walter, is there anything that reg citizens can do to help with this?
902364606571696129 2017-08-28 02:57:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @CREWcrew @waltshaub Well Walter, you of course know that it is exactly that!
902361680314847232 2017-08-28 02:46:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila Well Ricky I don't know. I'd say Connecticut & CA were prob last thoughts. Texas wouldn't be too far from pardoning a racist really.
902349617920139269 2017-08-28 01:58:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Well I'd probably go with Awful. That pretty much sums up Steve King.
902341741247946752 2017-08-28 01:26:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews Tucker sucks!
902341363978690560 2017-08-28 01:25:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @hardball @SteveKornacki @rickwtyler @Nickiflorida @peace_debbie pic.twitter.com/y0zToDdrFA
902336267119099907 2017-08-28 01:05:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Yep can't wait for that!
902334253358252032 2017-08-28 00:57:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @hardball @SteveKornacki @rickwtyler @Nickiflorida @peace_debbie Hey Rick, can't you defend your poorly chosen words?  You backed Ted Cruz, no further info necessary. He's really one of the worst Rs, IMO.
902333288118968320 2017-08-28 00:53:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @hardball @SteveKornacki @rickwtyler @Nickiflorida Says the guy who backed Cruz for Pres. Cruz is a "little psychopathic" so there's that to factor in. Tyler your words are worthless.
902332415896629249 2017-08-28 00:49:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @hardball @SteveKornacki @rickwtyler @Nickiflorida @peace_debbie A "little bipolar" is as inappropriate as "bipolar"! The guy backed Ted Cruz for Pres.listening to him at all is ill advised.
902331533704519680 2017-08-28 00:46:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABC How? Karma is a Bitch!
902329938535219204 2017-08-28 00:39:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @hardball @SteveKornacki @rickwtyler @Nickiflorida Not, poor choice of words.
902329134852001792 2017-08-28 00:36:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @NBCNews @dmmf7 Wtf, that's already been established.
902328368431030272 2017-08-28 00:33:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @rmecheeya What do you like about him. He couldn't  be more fake or less genuine if he tried. You need a new BS meter Peggy.
902326031222284289 2017-08-28 00:24:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomPerez @Ange_Amene I agree. Let them go Tom.
902324565027807232 2017-08-28 00:18:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoelOsteen @JOHNNYSWIM @suelovesdc @CDelilahK BOT.
902324338032029701 2017-08-28 00:17:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoelOsteen @JOHNNYSWIM WRONG.
902323100313899010 2017-08-28 00:12:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @RawStory Wow nice guy 
902322320622190600 2017-08-28 00:09:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @billmaher @EdanClay SAME. Milo connection says it all.
902321967939903488 2017-08-28 00:08:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProudResister The fact that he has no idea how that statement comes across says it all.Successful business men just don't say stuff like that-EVER.
902320539993350144 2017-08-28 00:02:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @hardball @SteveKornacki @rickwtyler @Nickiflorida Ummm no saying that trump's behavior is bipolar was just wrong. Very poor choice of words, IMO.
902311908191199232 2017-08-28 23:28:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram Yes, I will never again trust the Republicans, EVER.
902308716522995712 2017-08-28 23:15:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram Seems to me there are plenty of Rs who could look the other way. They certainly hAve many times in the past. Just ask the two Texas Senators
902306751978110976 2017-08-28 23:07:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram No, Absolutely not. No way.
902302333845065728 2017-08-28 22:50:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @SheOfTheMyst @peterdaou Yes, I'm so tired of people saying he's not a Republican. Of course he is,that's why so many Rs voted for him. They elected him, they own it
902263024622424064 2017-08-28 20:14:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @AndreaChalupa Oh god NO, if I accidentally look at something from Ivanka, I quickly let it go.
902258164673896448 2017-08-28 19:54:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Geee imagine that from the Gov of Texas. BHO could have done exact same thing and he'd claim it was wholly inadequate.
902250841616330756 2017-08-28 19:25:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @LadydeLuce @gqmartinez No you most certainly are not.
902250338782236672 2017-08-28 19:23:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Some of us listened Sarah. We're still listening.
902249502786117638 2017-08-28 19:20:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @DarrellIssa @MikeLevinCA He and many other Cons.
902247123604959233 2017-08-28 19:10:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarionBurr5 @NancySinatra Oh my god, just when it seems he can't get any sleazier, he does. Too bad we don't have someone in charge of ethics.
902243923875291137 2017-08-28 18:58:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnJHarwood Boy that's really rich coming from Rat Fink Cruz since he's the king of petty political sniping.
902243338799259648 2017-08-28 18:55:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @NathanHRubin Yes, it's really only an important problem if it's their important problem.
902237872773894147 2017-08-28 18:34:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @viacampmimi @TeaPainUSA You totally called that Tea, that's not all is it?
902237343108800513 2017-08-28 18:32:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @WomanMDsGuide @AndrewBeatty All the better to shoot the POC with, to really dig deep on that abuse of power.
902236662486495232 2017-08-28 18:29:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Nothing to see there!!!
902235745208991744 2017-08-28 18:25:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger They will also foster abuse of POC & immigrants. Then when they revolt they'll point the finger at them for being "BAD" people. SOS.
902235285358080000 2017-08-28 18:23:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger Does not make govt any smaller. Cons will allow abuse of banking & enviro and then wonder how things got so screwed up when economy tanks!
902234850161283072 2017-08-28 18:22:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger That's just Con speak for saying power to the rich. Voting NO on every program to benefit poor people and yes on those that help the rich.
902234031055626247 2017-08-28 18:18:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger BS Jennifer. Is that what Cons have been doing? Limited and http://transparent.You are rational and you know that's BS.
902228166294597636 2017-08-28 17:55:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila Omg what next. Richard Spencer for president?
902227084365484032 2017-08-28 17:51:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @Patrick_J_Egan What climate instability? That's just Fake News.
902227084306735104 2017-08-28 17:51:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Bahahaha T-Rex, I prefer Rexon, but that's good! Is he next? Just when it began to look like he actually cared a little bit. No Surprise.
902217315344900097 2017-08-28 17:12:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @lawfareblog @TheRickWilson @AdavisWilliams @accidntlmystic That's how trump knew he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and get away with it. They're totally complicit!
902217041150697474 2017-08-28 17:11:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @lawfareblog @TheRickWilson @AdavisWilliams @accidntlmystic And they shared the wealth among other Cons, buying their loyalty. Impeach trump, impeach themselves.
902216624517898240 2017-08-28 17:09:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @lawfareblog @TheRickWilson @AdavisWilliams @accidntlmystic Not just, also McConnell and Ryan. They've been enjoying those rubles for quite some time. The dirty Koch and Mercer money wasn't enough.
902206561103355906 2017-08-28 16:29:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @LawyerRogelio He is so removed from humanity, it's unbelievable.
902205799082098688 2017-08-28 16:26:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @perlmutations No Shit Ron. Just because Kasich is rational doesn't mean he's right.
902205254489473024 2017-08-28 16:24:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur Gee I wonder why???
902204962431696899 2017-08-28 16:23:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @lawfareblog @TheRickWilson @AdavisWilliams Greed, both for power and money. Lack of any moral compass. It pretty much tells you who they are.
902204304798486529 2017-08-28 16:20:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @boru2308 @TheRickWilson And yet Rick, you continue to call yourself a Republican. What's up with that. The Rs have clearly lost sight of right/wrong. Your excuse?
902202567228317697 2017-08-28 16:13:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @cassandra17lina @sweetdaddyo That's putting it lightly, think you forgot greed.
902201979082039296 2017-08-28 16:11:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @KangasMom1 He's also the one with the mail order bride.
902129490519838722 2017-08-28 11:23:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 She's beautiful. Too bad for her she's doing it under trump's regime.
901982922659553281 2017-08-27 01:41:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @nickiknowsnada He most certainly is a Republican. The Ana's et al are now the rare exception. Way to much Faux News has brain washed the R Party-Cultists.
901982085308715008 2017-08-27 01:37:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro Ana, I appreciate your honesty. Isn't it time you put your womanhood & Latina Heritage before your taxes. You don't fit with the Racist Rs.
901979733042364416 2017-08-27 01:28:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @Creampuffgal @perlmutations Really, they want less regulation so that banks & industry can scam, screw & pollute our country. They don't give a damn about poor or sick.
901856583600177152 2017-08-27 17:18:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @eugenegu Gee, maybe the scientists had some idea what they were talking about after all. Hurricane  Eclipse  Climate Instability 
901854049561137153 2017-08-27 17:08:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @mshopemac @DMRDynamics Completely unaware of how his words are perceived because he is unable to divorce himself from his own self-worship. #NotNormal #RESIST
901852112178511877 2017-08-27 17:01:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @LcrmFirm @TheRickyDavila One terrible, awful, nasty, hateful, bigoted SOB thing after another. 100% Disgrace and Embarrassing. An International Assault on Democracy.
901796900000686080 2017-08-27 13:21:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @tenax666 AGAIN!
901796602775564290 2017-08-27 13:20:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix Awesome. Despite so many current issues. Americans are Americans at heart.Too bad POTUS does all he can do to sully that fact. SAD,BAD,WRONG
901791600849952769 2017-08-27 13:00:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @RWPUSA "Revealed" sure.
901791289875853312 2017-08-27 12:59:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlisonForKY That's nice Alison,could you focus more on lives that Nut Job Bevin is effecting today with his Racist/Pro 1%/Regressive/Anti Women Policies
901788542631890944 2017-08-27 12:48:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @johnlundin Stuck here in Kentucky, do you want it? Because some of us would love to send it the heck out of here!
901787524821123072 2017-08-27 12:44:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @xduglopsaysx That's not true. Are you a 0? You may not like it but everybody leans onexway or another. Own it.
901786886280278016 2017-08-27 12:42:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @proffitt_marcia @ACLU Hope you kick the shit out of that old orange wind bag.
901551008173707264 2017-08-26 21:04:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind So true and I thought my eyes were wide open but no.
901549133303078913 2017-08-26 20:57:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @BenSasse @olgaNYC1211 I'm sure they're completely unrelated.
901525625793589249 2017-08-26 19:23:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @831silvercat @dumptrump33 Bahahaha no they're not.
901521405141028865 2017-08-26 19:07:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @kelliwardaz @realDonaldTrump @olgaNYC1211 Kelli Ward Hate Extraordinaire. Trying to grab McCain's seat before his body is cold. These people are without any shame. It's totally sick.
901479732050632709 2017-08-26 16:21:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @puppymnkey @RepMaxineWaters He's Swamp Scum.
901443971330736132 2017-08-26 13:59:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @MidwinCharles White, with a brain and soul.
901439366974885888 2017-08-26 13:41:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @CGasparino IDIOT.
901437414836776961 2017-08-26 13:33:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @raulita @peterdaou They were not conned, they were completely complicit.
901437111370481665 2017-08-26 13:32:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @LiberalMmama @peterdaou I feel the bar is so low that it would have to be something really horrific. That's truly sad, but all things point to it as fact.
901431176753295360 2017-08-26 13:08:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrendanNyhan @JonEHecht @alibaba5826 IDIOT.
901428785232433152 2017-08-26 12:59:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @JonEHecht WOW.
901428439403704320 2017-08-26 12:57:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Wait, most disgusting, the guy who did it.
901176764294103041 2017-08-25 20:17:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @TruckersVote @TreyYingst Oh My.
901168181716418561 2017-08-25 19:43:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Yea, just like Republicans are "SAFE"???
901167820742025216 2017-08-25 19:42:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @adamcbest @kennydillon Ridiculous.
901123692461248512 2017-08-25 16:46:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @goldengateblond That pic makes me tear up. How we went from Joe Cool to Joe Idiot I'll never understand. Dems falsely got rap for obstructing & it's the Rs!
901122943215960064 2017-08-25 16:43:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @POLITICO_Steve @politico @bogucki_john We are all on our own. Two branches of our govt have taken a permanent leave of absence. Until Dems take their places, we're SOL.
901097042768007173 2017-08-25 15:00:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytimes But then he let GREED get the better of him.
901095768139980800 2017-08-25 14:55:47 UTC <HenslerKate> Yes, somehow I knew exactly what trump would be but allowed myself to believe that the Cons had some loyalty to Country. Dangerously wrong.
901094071560790016 2017-08-25 14:49:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @MarkHalperin @TommyLeeAllman He's not!
901093971686023168 2017-08-25 14:48:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @lizfinger1 @MarkHalperin And yet, he does represent what it is to be a Republican. Just ask Mitch & Paul R as they sit quietly & let him stab them in the back. TAXES
901093199497789440 2017-08-25 14:45:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP The GOP lack of loyalty to their own party just may bring down our Democracy. It's sick. Assuming we vote again, the SOBs need to pay.
901092711587094528 2017-08-25 14:43:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @NYDailyNews @USOPM @RepMikeRogers Saw u on CNN. Wake up Mike, he's trying to take over our govt. Not by legislating but by consolidating power. Authoritarian Playbook-Get It?
901091581335408641 2017-08-25 14:39:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @KellyannePolls Ummm how many years ago was that? Did he too get arrested at a KKK RALLY or was that just trumps dad?
901090191556870144 2017-08-25 14:33:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer Sad at Best.
901089967551778816 2017-08-25 14:32:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @Discon1948 IDIOT!
901072341068910597 2017-08-25 13:22:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @aravosis No Doubt About It.
900927536292667392 2017-08-24 03:47:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @rieth_damon @bravenak Yes she was robbed. By a lying, cheating, mobster who used Russia to steal the presidency.
900860643691155458 2017-08-24 23:21:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepMaxineWaters @watzgoinonhere @ericgarland I would pay big time for that!
900790209943670784 2017-08-24 18:41:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald What is it with men and back scratchers?
900788107636822017 2017-08-24 18:33:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Same for those in Congress who have remained silent.
900740777562828801 2017-08-24 15:25:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA Good for you Mike, good for you.
900739489978605569 2017-08-24 15:20:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @ananavarro God they need to dump him already-he was so bad. Nice quoting Pres Clinton about Monica for lying reference-ridiculous.
900738134509445124 2017-08-24 15:14:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @tribelaw @stevendupler I'm a Dem but blaming McConnell for extreme views in R party is not right. Moderates want some healthcare, tea party nut jobs want none!
900736943817928704 2017-08-24 15:09:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @tribelaw And by "legislation" he means everything.
900736522923765760 2017-08-24 15:08:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton Like a racist middle schooler got elected president-such a sad statement.
900735228288925697 2017-08-24 15:03:07 UTC <HenslerKate> And he's too out there to even notice that.
900698237199409152 2017-08-24 12:36:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @royster47 They're complicit-No Real Choice.
900697748873392128 2017-08-24 12:34:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 It's almost like they should have known better than to have made a deal with the devil. Reap What You Sow.
900692134625464320 2017-08-24 12:11:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @exoticgamora Moral Authority? You've got to be kidding.
900688756734382080 2017-08-24 11:58:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdanClay I like RepubliKlan or Cons. Both seem to work.
900581041492160512 2017-08-23 04:50:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @DinahPryde Yea he was awful. Total trump idiot.
900566232428146688 2017-08-23 03:51:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @atDavidHoffman Yes, very disturbing.
900548028217663489 2017-08-23 02:39:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Bahahaha as if trump tweeted this!!!!
900490102799040513 2017-08-23 22:49:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @AprilDRyan @ananavarro Jack doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground.
900478796511539200 2017-08-23 22:04:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @bsherwood1961 So true, he's never even mentioned them.
900476981443219458 2017-08-23 21:56:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonbez66 @realDonaldTrump No You're just a two bit con man who lies, lies, and lies.
900474513518977025 2017-08-23 21:47:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @markfromhalsey @dumptrump33 @MachadoRocky Yes and brain washed.
900474370627383296 2017-08-23 21:46:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @dumptrump33 Yes I agree. He does have that big sniff thing going on.
900362025498361856 2017-08-23 14:20:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump So Completely Beneath the Office, SHAMEFUL.
900336592618999809 2017-08-23 12:39:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisCuomo @ananavarro @realDonaldTrump @CNN @NewDay @benfergusonshow Really Ben, that smirk on your face says it all. It's clearly a very short list of those willing to defend trump. You should be ashamed.
900324546355527682 2017-08-23 11:51:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @robreiner Apparently Not. Only their own power.
900203197326909440 2017-08-22 03:49:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @MeghanMcCain @Friskytravelers "This person" is a trump supporter.
900202908305719299 2017-08-22 03:47:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @MeghanMcCain Yes it's awful. You Republicans are the most back stabbing lot I've ever seen. What trump said about your dad alone should have ended it.
900163946690338816 2017-08-22 01:13:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @chelseahandler The F***ing Oligarchs.
900116461305421826 2017-08-22 22:04:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Well sorry, but I'm still going to enjoy it.
900093608489095168 2017-08-22 20:33:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @HoneyDemForce No Doubt He's All In All Right! Can't Wsit To See Him Fall.
900091912274751491 2017-08-22 20:26:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlecMacGillis @angry_gram No Surprise, it's a Disaster. Just like they wanted
900089681316114432 2017-08-22 20:17:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyOShea @TheRickWilson Past time I'd say.
900079877327552512 2017-08-22 19:39:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @watzgoinonhere @BeSeriousUSA I do t know if he means it for a sign or not. Miller certainly did in photo months ago. Trump shouldn't be doing it, either way!
900069274181619715 2017-08-22 18:56:52 UTC <HenslerKate> Oh thank God. Thanks for your help too Jesse!
900064091351470082 2017-08-22 18:36:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger @dave_in_sa No from the Koch Brothers, much worse.
900063626526171136 2017-08-22 18:34:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger @Ll129Tomgirl Well really same with Pence at this point.
900063207695503361 2017-08-22 18:32:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 @JRubinBlogger His is a very wrong form of "Christianity".
900023272204644352 2017-08-22 15:54:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @davidaxelrod I'd say no, he hasn't  the balls for that.
899994609912352776 2017-08-22 14:00:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @Fahrenthold @drewharwell @carlhurdmba @PhilipRucker Phil are you trying to recover from your ridiculous comment regarding trump's speech? Honestly, I was surprised you made it. Really?!?!
899981695138631681 2017-08-22 13:08:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @EdanClay I couldn't agree more. He's so sanctimonious and such a sellout. He's such a sell out slime ball.
899827905441800194 2017-08-21 02:57:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @StopTheSpeaker Glad I didn't watch. No way would I watch Paul Ryan do Anything. His words are completely meaningless.
899818818448621568 2017-08-21 02:21:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @PhilipRucker Please not again Philip, save your breath. This makes you sound really ignorant.
899764671095484420 2017-08-21 22:46:29 UTC <HenslerKate> "On all sides"
899725136777105408 2017-08-21 20:09:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @viacampmimi @RWPUSA Yes, it's a total farce. Not much that's "Religious" or "Right" about them.
899718221607165952 2017-08-21 19:41:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Here in Cadiz KY on boat at Lake Barkley it was awesome!
899606100730933248 2017-08-21 12:16:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyraDSirois1 @realDonaldTrump Said no real president, Ever.
899600421924327424 2017-08-21 11:53:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @ShaunKing @zdroberts Awesome, lock their loser asses up.
899599844305756161 2017-08-21 11:51:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ALT_uscis He always has black right behind him holding signs, now we know how. He's so GROSS.
899599324270743553 2017-08-21 11:49:27 UTC <HenslerKate> Hey Tomi, go back to the basement.
899592371469418497 2017-08-21 11:21:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Oh please, they know that's not true. It's just something to say. It's their "pivot".
899340913784356864 2017-08-20 18:42:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 @Mikel_Jollett They all look very stressed out 
899340053293539329 2017-08-20 18:39:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @maggieNYT It always affects his behavior.
899339471023472641 2017-08-20 18:36:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @JasonQSD @JohnFugelsang Yea means about as much as those in the WH saying it. I just assume it's a lie now.
899304660376444929 2017-08-20 16:18:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Trump until we flip the house then I'd take Pence, at least he's not suffering from dementia but he's super bad himself.
899261233303625728 2017-08-20 13:26:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @therealLAVALLEE moolllvzA buyggjjjhum. Vbjkivggyp
899250786131214338 2017-08-20 12:44:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @robinbird52 @JoyAnnReid CRICKETS ON THAT NO DOUBT.
899249414988083200 2017-08-20 12:39:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill OFFS, trump didn't do that, he just used what was there. CONS have been pushing racist views for years which is why they voted for trump.
899248274087043073 2017-08-20 12:34:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid He seems miserable.
899247668706373637 2017-08-20 12:32:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @vicenews @SenatorTimScott A black man standing with trump and other racists? Hmmm I just don't get it. I'm a white woman and he's way past acceptable. DEFECT.
899245516873236480 2017-08-20 12:23:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @EdanClay I'll bet he'd never do it either, so there's that.
899245328150523904 2017-08-20 12:22:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Guess our government isn't the only one that's been corrupted.
899241713100886021 2017-08-20 12:08:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix Yea it doesn't "pass the smell test". What do you suppose?
899115921847058436 2017-08-19 03:48:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Of course it will. Money is everything to him. That will burn for sure.
899109103892652032 2017-08-19 03:21:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @ZimIrken2 @williamlegate Yes they seem to always be looking for trouble.They're not Progressive,they're Aggressives.Dems don't like fighting. Thanks, but No Thanks.
898927050538459136 2017-08-19 15:18:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Great Job Sarah. You are an inspiration to the #Resistance. A lighthouse in this storm of trump tornado. Our Democracy must be victorious.
898911827513552898 2017-08-19 14:17:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @cmclymer That is great. Lead by example. Duke will still be Duke. Very pretty campus.
898904956136071168 2017-08-19 13:50:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @anniekarni @realDonaldTrump You lie like a rug.
898901674068123649 2017-08-19 13:37:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @peterdaou TOTALLY TRUE. You can't "steal" a victory. McConnell is a creep.
898899848262537218 2017-08-19 13:29:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @VP @shrantheman @tenax666 Oh got ya, I think some Dem voters would. When it's really bad I think maybe? But Pence is just as bad but a lot more capable so NO.
898899049398644736 2017-08-19 13:26:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @johnlundin You know they'd get Booed. How far this has fallen. You did this @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP.
898898052231999489 2017-08-19 13:22:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @VP @shrantheman @tenax666 Not this Dem. I see him as even more dangerous. I hope trump hangs on long enough for us to flip the House. Then maybe Pence.
898896604245000192 2017-08-19 13:17:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @ericgarland Agreed, that dog don't hunt.
898891832397975554 2017-08-19 12:58:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP She's so gross.
898891632023658497 2017-08-19 12:57:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @DavidRutz @GhostSciencMike Bot!
898708750386827264 2017-08-18 00:50:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost FINALLY!!!
898708123560620033 2017-08-18 00:48:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @FriendEden100 Look at that, he's getting a nose full of sweet baby. Good for whatever ails you. I miss him so much. How good we had it 
898701306721845248 2017-08-18 00:21:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @SykesCharlie Not the bridge trump built to the Alt Right.
898693498622197762 2017-08-18 23:50:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @martinez_jack Yes, I can't stand him. He needs to go!
898645730855755776 2017-08-18 20:40:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheDemocrats @DineshDSouza @14REBELLION Blah blah blah, wrong Bot!
898617949686300672 2017-08-18 18:49:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @RogueSNRadvisor @mitwee1 @tweetiestate This wasn't just Kelly. No Way.
898617198536609792 2017-08-18 18:46:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @RogueSNRadvisor Totally Agree. He was forced. He's gonna be really mad & really crazy.
898616809989058561 2017-08-18 18:45:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @OhNoSheTwitnt @alisongreenberg Ok that's really pretty funny-no offense. Amazing how people miss the obvious. They need to stop voting their pocket books. (Louis Bags).
898616262032543746 2017-08-18 18:43:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @OhNoSheTwitnt Yes isn't that special! Hope it's short and sweet.
898615237082873856 2017-08-18 18:39:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @dumptrump33 KISMET. You were channeling him!
898615017989341184 2017-08-18 18:38:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @davidaxelrod @shellyc42 Lol. I don't know him very well but he's a nice guy, he wasn't with me very long
898607041937383425 2017-08-18 18:06:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT @BrianRoth6 No. He used Breitbart and Russian ties to "coordinate" things. Trump should be scared, but he's too narcissistic to realize that.
898606658997239809 2017-08-18 18:04:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT No arm twisting necessary, trump can RACIST all on his own can't he.
898604357054152704 2017-08-18 17:55:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedwoodGirl @plunkert Awesome. "I love It".
898604159661821952 2017-08-18 17:55:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @taylorbunnag @davidaxelrod Totally! He's very predictable. Predictably demented.
898603458609152000 2017-08-18 17:52:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @billyeichner @RogerPicardUSA Robert & Rebekah Mercer.
898602737776066560 2017-08-18 17:49:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @resistancepie @NancyPelosi It most certainly does not!Trump is a racist and he must go. He's also not smart, dishonest, paranoid, narcissistic, impulsive, and demented
898602032164155392 2017-08-18 17:46:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix You're welcome-I enjoyed it! Who's Next?
898563769046978560 2017-08-18 15:14:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @RitaJ2011 @funder @Helenhs If only. No I don't see that. Trump lacks the strength of character for that. He will have to be forced out by Congress.
898560704340295680 2017-08-18 15:02:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram @washingtonpost Well of course she has, that's who these people are. Sick Stuff.

898552275949543424 2017-08-18 14:28:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Aroliso @Steven_M17 Supreme Leader?
898549499798450176 2017-08-18 14:17:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs He probably cut the budget to 0, art's not exactly his thing.
898543396553228288 2017-08-18 13:53:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @Varidienne @battletested5 Really, he's learning but really very slowly. Old habits die hard I suppose.
898542686684106754 2017-08-18 13:50:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RocBorja @wmmII88 Sorry I'm a Dem and I don't stand for any of that crazy stuff, but I'll bet you do on the right 
898542201054961665 2017-08-18 13:48:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @wmmII88 Is that Wilbur Ross? Pretty sure he's going down! Ps your meme is true.
898541379260825600 2017-08-18 13:45:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Really? God you suck at this!

898538847386058753 2017-08-18 13:35:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump It's not the borders we're concerned about.
898536707422797825 2017-08-18 13:26:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @IndivisibleTeam @SenBobCorker @indivisible_tn Wtf, that's a little too much squeezing.
898535580555821059 2017-08-18 13:22:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw I can honestly say, nothing would surprise me.
898522897668423680 2017-08-18 12:32:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @CoreyStewartVA @lowkell And that he did!
898522737102118914 2017-08-18 12:31:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CoreyStewartVA Really Corey "Are you looking in the mirror again" what's that Third Grade Talk? I think you should stick with Faux News, that was not good
898520529581289473 2017-08-18 12:22:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @johnastoehr @watzgoinonhere If only, but I don't think it will be too soon. Trump is crashing and burning though-that's for sure!
898519977564811265 2017-08-18 12:20:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepJoeKennedy @EricVeltri I think he may.
898519304152461312 2017-08-18 12:17:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @AAgathon2017 @rabiasquared Texas is by far my least favorite state. They give REDNECK new meaning.
898518622355771393 2017-08-18 12:15:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @Creampuffgal @mcspocky Wow that's a very flattering pic of Rush. He's way grosser than that!

898515921073045505 2017-08-18 12:04:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheDemocrats @DineshDSouza @14REBELLION Stuff like this is stupid. Those same "democrats" are now RepubliKlans so what's that tell you? The Southern Strategy worked-Own It.
898515161799172096 2017-08-18 12:01:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheDemocrats @DineshDSouza You are gross. You're pretty brown to be a racist but whatever. When the RepubliKlans turn on you, we will still accept you-if you change.
898513362685972480 2017-08-18 11:54:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CoreyStewartVA "Defend Our History" racist much?
898513050407510016 2017-08-18 11:52:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CoreyStewartVA Damn I missed it. Just kidding-I wouldn't watch you, you're with trump. Folks will not forget that. You Will Lose-ENJOY!
898503729862901760 2017-08-18 11:15:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @CitizenKayS @kylegriffin1 Shouldn't be too hard!
898503262877491201 2017-08-18 11:14:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @cre8ivetype @AnneFrankCenter Is anybody really surprised. Only sleaze balls would be there in the first place. They'll stay as long as they possibly can.
898310380451221504 2017-08-17 22:27:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Oh God, I'm going to be sick.

898308902965592065 2017-08-17 22:21:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix 100%
898307854486163456 2017-08-17 22:17:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 And even some white women voters (though not nearly enough).
898307299881742336 2017-08-17 22:15:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @JulianAssange @DanaRohrabacher @renato_mariotti Well I'm going with he's been bought and payed for by none other than Putin. Just like Paul Ryan hushed many months ago.Invoking family ties
898305792641835008 2017-08-17 22:09:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Not forgotten, just moved on to the next outrageous act. Honestly if I didn't move on, I'm pretty sure I'd have a stroke.
898304471033360385 2017-08-17 22:04:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas There's just way too much to keep straight. Amy Siskind does a great service by documenting all of the craziness.

898254511952678913 2017-08-17 18:45:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @YourRacingBelle Wow well I'm crying but thank you for sharing lest we forget how ugly this stuff really is. #RESIST.

898226956210143232 2017-08-17 16:56:09 UTC <HenslerKate> No he'll be on a beautiful golf course.
898225961363288066 2017-08-17 16:52:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff So true Congressman Schiff, 2020 can't come soon enough. Please run for President.

898173590486601728 2017-08-17 13:24:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuddLegum In a NY minutex100.
898172619014492160 2017-08-17 13:20:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @spokanetom @4everNeverTrump Hannity taught him that.
898171216925687808 2017-08-17 13:14:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump There's that White Supremacist bullhorn again.
898153995566448641 2017-08-17 12:06:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub Not J. Gorsuch, Golly Gee Willikers, he wouldn't consider doing anything that was prohibited by the constitution. He's a "Constitutionalist"
898152487248695296 2017-08-17 12:00:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @alaskarebel Couldn't happen to a more deserving guy.
898151024866844672 2017-08-17 11:54:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @831silvercat @felicia4217 Ok folks he's pretty darn identifiable. Somebody out there knows-DO THE PROPER THING AND GIVE HIS WEASLE ASS UP.
898148903224320000 2017-08-17 11:45:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @JeffreyGuterman @eugenegu @Rojos1973 Oh No I hadn't heard that, that's terrible.
898147642567520257 2017-08-17 11:40:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @BrendaMCotter So true,I just can't listen to learned men saying "he just needs to, focus, delegate,quit tweeting, pivot, focus.... as though it's possible
898146754914377729 2017-08-17 11:37:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou No surprise to any one who was paying attention and didn't agree. I must admit that seeing how many agree is shocking to me.
898143013830086656 2017-08-17 11:22:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump So childish.
898142893097005057 2017-08-17 11:22:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump No we all heard you.
898142733327577088 2017-08-17 11:21:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You're a sick man Donnie.
898014866677608449 2017-08-16 02:53:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @therealLAVALLEE @MichaelPetrilli Yea, that party of Lincoln thing died a long time ago. Welcome to the light Michael.
898002898394779648 2017-08-16 02:05:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @RegBarclay2017 Or at least who lead the sheep. Definitely Ryan & McConnell.
897980028306247681 2017-08-16 00:34:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @euchreman1022 @matthewamiller Hmmm hadn't thought of that but I feel pretty good about it.
897979087767130115 2017-08-16 00:31:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol So glad to hear it.
897969711752904709 2017-08-16 23:53:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT @tenax666 Oh yes, quite sometime ago. Trump certainly knows it.
897934935939362816 2017-08-16 21:35:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @shoreboy1961 @RVAwonk And who is surprised? I'm certainly not.

897851904998477824 2017-08-16 16:05:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @mbachelet @VP You are every bit as gross as the man you serve. We know who and what you are too pence.
897851047372345344 2017-08-16 16:02:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobinRWSauls @RichHalliburton No, he's been that for a very long time. Just ask the Central Park Five.
897849167200104448 2017-08-16 15:54:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @hughhewitt @SRuhle @RonTh310 Me either he's gross! Right up there with Jeffrey Lord.
897848864962641920 2017-08-16 15:53:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @SybilT2 @FrancesRauer No, their language is HATE.
897848356306923520 2017-08-16 15:51:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @hughhewitt @SRuhle Yes, this is bull. You can't separate the two. I guess you didn't see the hate spewing from him yesterday. How's your bud the Mooch?
897846102636072960 2017-08-16 15:42:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @mshopemac @tribelaw Answer is obvious. The 1%. The RW Donor elite. And the millionaire Republicans in Congress.
897845000565907456 2017-08-16 15:38:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @CuriousGreg Kentucky has a very long way to go.
897838498249674752 2017-08-16 15:12:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You are a total perversion of all that is right.
897818206559244290 2017-08-16 13:51:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper I'm sure after trump gets done supporting White Supremacists, he'll have some kind words for his family.
897817168812945408 2017-08-16 13:47:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @PastorDScott @SRuhle Yea, that's when I turned you off!
897817047765315585 2017-08-16 13:47:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP Cool, as long as we get to send those who like the statues with them!
897816806492078080 2017-08-16 13:46:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Dribble.
897816330811957248 2017-08-16 13:44:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @ClaraJeffery @matthewamiller Their words are completely meaningless.
897815425261744128 2017-08-16 13:40:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @DHLUS @McConnellPress @lovenothate1960 He's supporting it, no doubt. Mitch is a spineless slug who only really cares about tax cuts for the rich. He sold his soul many years ago.
897815023531249664 2017-08-16 13:39:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @DHLUS @McConnellPress Nope me neither! No Way in Hell!
897811990487474176 2017-08-16 13:27:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Seems to me that's exactly what they are. Even their White Privilege wasn't enough to help them be confident and successful.
897809768097644544 2017-08-16 13:18:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @MichaelCohen212 Sure Mike, support a racist, be a racist. No matter how many pics you take with Black People you post. Your family should be ashamed.

897667113472675840 2017-08-15 03:51:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @lizfinger1 @DavidOAtkins God she was just awful.
897656359386218496 2017-08-15 03:08:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobinRWSauls @politicususa I'm sorry who in the heck would think that was an accident.
897655119432605698 2017-08-15 03:03:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @rjakes65 @PrincessBravato Please don't quote Ron Paul, he's a Putin loving nut job.
897621060870385664 2017-08-15 00:48:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Will do, like I said I know that the Alt Right type haters are ideologically in step with Putin.  But I'll read it for sure!
897609050736799745 2017-08-15 00:00:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Though I don't know this to be true, it sure would make sense.
897608218280701952 2017-08-15 23:57:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @Campbells @rjakes65 @LiberalLab Not one bit & I do like some of it too.
897602214574923776 2017-08-15 23:33:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @PARISDENNARD @EdanClay He's so bad, haven't seen him in quite awhile.
897601822659104775 2017-08-15 23:32:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @robreiner Let's hope, I'm not convinced. They'll give it the old "trump shouldn't have said that, now TAX CUTS FOR TGE RICH".
897601239013363712 2017-08-15 23:29:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @mshopemac @brianstelter @Rayat618 No doubt Rand Paul is fully aware that trump is unhinged, he's just trying to squeeze some tax cuts for the 1%.
897599898920656896 2017-08-15 23:24:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @marcorubio That's a crock of crap Marco. GOP Congress owns plenty of that blame. Trump was just trump today and yet you make comments about Organizers
897590451544481792 2017-08-15 22:46:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @teenytinyflame @bryanbehar Total Scam, Start to Finish. The reason I cried when he won.
897588645540003840 2017-08-15 22:39:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @mshopemac @brianstelter Howard Dean is also a Physician.

897580157904539650 2017-08-15 22:06:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jayge26 @RWPUSA No they must quit u til trump is gone. This needs to end, it's ripping our country to shreds.
897572365416235008 2017-08-15 21:35:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @imillhiser And that is saying a hell of a lot.
897571681790824448 2017-08-15 21:32:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald @StrongDemocrat True but do we really know for certain that Russian propaganda and voting machine weren't altered. Stats on him winning 3 states VERY LOW!!!
897571001483100164 2017-08-15 21:29:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald Well I'm going north. I refuse to be stuck in KY.

897544396668796929 2017-08-15 19:43:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @alfranken Really at the end of the day, that is what Dems stand for.
897542798223613953 2017-08-15 19:37:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @alfranken I agree Robin
897541179901853696 2017-08-15 19:31:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @elonmusk @exoticgamora Awesome!
897536601131233280 2017-08-15 19:12:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @RichardTrumka @johnastoehr Exactly, thy should have never gone. Anybody who believes trump is pro union is pretty darn slow.
897519369865056256 2017-08-15 18:04:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Idiot.
897486753476599808 2017-08-15 15:54:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @rieth_damon @JoyAnnReid Yes, it's clear where the strength of character came from.
897469770899050496 2017-08-15 14:47:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump He's sickening.
897469553688670209 2017-08-15 14:46:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC I've totally had it with their support of him. He in NO way represents my America. They will pay in 2018!!!
897469176012562432 2017-08-15 14:45:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Barf. I'm sure she's dreadful, look at him.

897432414057885696 2017-08-15 12:18:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @CampbellSoupCo @realDonaldTrump @skennison @Alyssa_Milano I want the women out, they should have never participated in the first place.
897432218653650944 2017-08-15 12:18:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @RichardTrumka Then step the hell down. If you're not against him, you're with him. Labor never should have been there in the first place!
897429634140319744 2017-08-15 12:07:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @Hillaryh4444Hos @SenJohnMcCain Sir, where are you on trump's response to the Alt Right Nazi people over the weekend? Please stand on the right side of history.
897428137478426625 2017-08-15 12:01:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper NO. It would be a huge problem.
897424331122368513 2017-08-15 11:46:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas No Surprise, he seemed to be enjoying it about as much as a root canal.
897423411768688643 2017-08-15 11:43:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Stop showing your tacky tax cut commercials to the 1% in Kentucky, they, like you, are gross.
897421744910282752 2017-08-15 11:36:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub In the big picture this is nothing for Crazy Pants. Sad but true.

897145399676424192 2017-08-14 17:18:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @DesertGalNM Exactly!!!
897140683433226240 2017-08-14 16:59:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub @DesertGalNM Seemed to be some anger there though, it reminded me of his nasty retraction of his years long birther crap.
897140326632235008 2017-08-14 16:58:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @waltshaub Walter, please know that many of us have a great deal of respect for you.
897135799711485952 2017-08-14 16:40:17 UTC <HenslerKate> Oh god, he's so pathetic !
897134467235631105 2017-08-14 16:34:59 UTC <HenslerKate> I'm sure trump will be every bit as remorseful about his failure to renounce Racist Haters as he was to renounce his Birthcrap. WORTHLESS.
897132448018051072 2017-08-14 16:26:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @sbauerAP @StopTheSpeaker I may have to go to protest!

897067919829499904 2017-08-14 12:10:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @ReignOfApril @juliaioffe I get what she's saying Julia. You may not have meant it that way but many people don't have a dad and don't mow others over with a car.
897062784810266624 2017-08-14 11:50:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix It was outrageous. Message: we have not forgotten the reason for that statue either. Welcome Rednecks, you have plenty of friends here.
896747881633284096 2017-08-13 14:58:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @Vallmeister Sadly very true.
896745280305016832 2017-08-13 14:48:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @KremlinTrolls I hate those Nazi haircuts!
896740823852863488 2017-08-13 14:30:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson Honest question Rick. You speak out a lot about trump, which is great. Did you vote for him? If not, who did you vote for?
896736543666253825 2017-08-13 14:13:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @tomperriello What the hell? Why are they allowed to be there with those guns?
896734513249873921 2017-08-13 14:05:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm Are those guys part of the Alt Right? With the guns and camo?
896734115713757184 2017-08-13 14:04:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenTedCruz Well this is total BS Ted. You've supported trump since he called you Lyin Ted. Support trump, support white supremacy!
896732608654176257 2017-08-13 13:58:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @IvankaTrump Except in the White House?? Your words are worthless Ivanka.
896726301209497602 2017-08-13 13:33:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan You're full of crap Paul. What about Bannon, Miller and Gorka in the WH? What about that White Supremacy Scourge? Are You OK with that?
896471375673782273 2017-08-12 20:40:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @angry_gram @melaniedeppen She needs to defect. I'm tired of reasonable Rs saying this isn't their party. They need to wake up, it is most certainly their party.
896440629454143489 2017-08-12 18:37:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @Time4Rise @womensmarch Not a problem here.
896437286539321344 2017-08-12 18:24:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump "Sad" wow that's profound!!!
896392641297993728 2017-08-12 15:27:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisJZullo @U_SeriousClark Yes it is Ryan. Maybe not your brand but what the hell do you think Bannon, Miller and Gorka are?
896391973980057600 2017-08-12 15:24:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisJZullo F***ing Martial Law for sure!
896391845655302144 2017-08-12 15:24:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @exoticgamora @naretevduorp Same here, I sure hope POC know that we don't all feel that way. They are repulsive haters. Can't be successful even with white privilege.
896390510105030656 2017-08-12 15:18:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuliusGoat Not a problem for me.

896387261843066880 2017-08-12 15:05:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs Crickets from Crazy Pants do doubt.
896360327675248642 2017-08-12 13:18:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Yes but before that they let the crazy tea party folks do the same. I guess when all you really care about is money,then you get this shit.
896356279853166593 2017-08-12 13:02:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Screw You Lindsey, is that clear? He's a total disaster and you damn well know it. No excuses for tragic Twitter trump, he stinks as a human
896355911253544962 2017-08-12 13:01:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckGrassley @waltshaub He's gross.
896350972963954690 2017-08-12 12:41:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @alaskarebel @RawStory Good.
896217458369015808 2017-08-11 03:51:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @puppymnkey @thehill That was NOT A F***ING JOKE. I've had it with the media going along with the idea that every stupid thing trump says is a "JOKE".
896203855968575488 2017-08-11 02:57:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro He totally meant what he said. I'm so tired of him getting a free pass on all of his lies. Remember alliance on hacking with Putin after G20
896183083661131782 2017-08-11 01:34:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA @McFaul Many have been brainwashed into believing Putin is on same team.The AltRight Muslim haters think the US should join with Russia against them
896181185453465601 2017-08-11 01:26:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk Idiot.
896175099568640002 2017-08-11 01:02:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @831silvercat @TheRickWilson It is the most revolting thing. He always uses his Lyin preacher eyes. Paul Ryan is just as good at them. Making it in the suck-up folder.
896172634727231489 2017-08-11 00:53:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Alyssa_Milano That would depend on which minute he was responding in.
896168139477721088 2017-08-11 00:35:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @ForwardKy @davidfrum I really hope he feels like the dumb shit that he is.
896153229477658624 2017-08-11 23:35:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier @jimsciutto No not one.
896118765108174848 2017-08-11 21:18:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @lizfinger1 Ummm no, nothing about his delivery indicated that he was being 'sarcastic'.
896118706580840449 2017-08-11 21:18:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @lizfinger1 Ummm no, nith
896116742509871104 2017-08-11 21:10:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk Tough titty said the kitty. They are going to find out, want to or not.
896100419545346048 2017-08-11 20:06:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @lizfinger1 @Acosta NOT.
896099369107169280 2017-08-11 20:01:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ACJJustice Ding, ding, ding we have a winner.
896074651759071232 2017-08-11 18:23:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur @greginthemiddle @KarenthePeach Yes very pretty. I don't think she's even 30. GROSS.
896072432074629120 2017-08-11 18:14:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur @greginthemiddle @KarenthePeach Oh you mean Hope Hicks who was rumored to be hooking up with sleaze bag Lewandowski during to campaign? Probably!
896066675774070784 2017-08-11 17:51:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul At least it would show Americans and our Allies that trump is not always subservient to Putin. But alas, he's always subservient to Putin.
896064483306610688 2017-08-11 17:43:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul I don't think he says that tongue in cheek. He's really that clueless. It's dangerous to belief that there's any real plan. He's dangerous.
896060080608518146 2017-08-11 17:25:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @margie43fair @GeeGeeAkili @cslarochelle @BJeanMohr1 @CedarLang @centsible @girlzinger @Teach3ca @JenniferADevon @SunflowerSoul71 @Ireland0828 This is sadly so true. He's so shallow and self-absorbed it's a total embarrassment to Americans, whether we all recognize it or not.
896058929486024706 2017-08-11 17:21:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur @greginthemiddle Trump likes to promote his "stars".
896058592708632576 2017-08-11 17:19:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur @greginthemiddle I too am full of Fire & Fury & frankly Power.  Kim Jong-trump will do that to a girl. Trump will probably claim Eminent Domain to take her.
896044588657512448 2017-08-11 16:24:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @bessbell Or a not so nice assisted living community.
896044405798428672 2017-08-11 16:23:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonlovett I'm sure you're crushed, bahahaha .
896043942487236610 2017-08-11 16:21:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur On a positive note, she's a hell of a lot better looking than Sarah H. Sanders.
896043382115577859 2017-08-11 16:19:24 UTC <HenslerKate> In his defense, taking the four letter words out of his vocabulary, cuts it down by about half.
896008880291012612 2017-08-11 14:02:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @juliaioffe I'll admit, at first I was sad about her loss. But honestly, for months now I've been mad as hell and I'm happy to tell anybody at any time.
896008380417966080 2017-08-11 14:00:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @WomanResistorNC @DearAuntCrabby @marciaknutsen For that I will never forgive them. EVER.
895999870573654018 2017-08-11 13:26:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @TDPattillo @DPRK_News In other words, they see it just as many Americans do.
895994041250205696 2017-08-11 13:03:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @PassarelliAllan @AynRandPaulRyan With you Holly.
895991257280913419 2017-08-11 12:52:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @peterdaou Poor Joe has had to eat a hell of a lot of crow. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy 
895988154137665536 2017-08-11 12:39:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw PROBABLY???
895987610581118976 2017-08-11 12:37:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite COMPLETELY. HE NEEDS TO BE "UNPRESIDENTED".
895987033814052864 2017-08-11 12:35:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @HuffPostPol @DearAuntCrabby He's only speaking the sad truth.
895986004015824896 2017-08-11 12:31:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @NakatomiTim @Dyann057 @beck_amikebeck NEVER. I will never support that idiot.
895985673680900098 2017-08-11 12:30:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @NakatomiTim @Dyann057 @beck_amikebeck Michael you need a brain transplant.
895985260755918848 2017-08-11 12:28:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @DaysLeft4Trump He'll never make that.
895984816788779008 2017-08-11 12:26:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Bullshit, in the end, they will all turn on trump.
895983890816544768 2017-08-11 12:23:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Hell No. Kelly is just another man, short of a straight jacket, no one will stop trump, he's a lunatic with the nuclear codes.
895982934968107012 2017-08-11 12:19:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Sorry Scott, that's a stretch. I'm almost always with you but that's not assault, that's just him being a dick.
895981815588020225 2017-08-11 12:14:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnWDean It's so so bad. Kim does his best to seem crazy, trump does his best to seem sane.
895980758950719488 2017-08-11 12:10:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas He is every rational American's worst fucking nightmare.Everyday I'm madder & madder at the Republicans for letting this continue. DANGEROUS
895979388432502784 2017-08-11 12:05:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA It seems that acceptance of Treason and Racketeering is not a great way to fill a White House with honest and patriotic people.
895978499240013824 2017-08-11 12:01:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Gorka says it all about this administration. It's just one HUGE Con Job. Grifters Galore.
895978083458719745 2017-08-11 11:59:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow Happy Birthday Charles, Enjoy!
895851378203078656 2017-08-10 03:36:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @WomanMDsGuide @peterdaou Honestly, this country elected Obama over Clinton. She was more qualified and the Black guy won, what's that tell you?
895828952983449600 2017-08-10 02:07:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix @MaxBoot No he's an idiot.

895646180218109952 2017-08-10 14:01:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump I REALLY don't like Jill Stein at all.

895457560614113280 2017-08-09 01:31:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @Heritage "Heritage" is right, heritage of racism and hatred toward fellow Americans. You can stick your Hating Heritage up your Hootie.

895401348623192065 2017-08-09 21:48:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu Trump seems to honestly believe his win lies. I guess so many years with a free pass leads to that.
895386392250994692 2017-08-09 20:48:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @TGowdySC @dcexaminer @The_CAPHR Clearly, it's a little too late for Trey.

895267380959621121 2017-08-09 12:55:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost She's GROSS. Pitiful excuse for a Harvard educated lawyer.
895266898899861504 2017-08-09 12:53:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @matthewamiller Oh Mathew,that's very judgemental of you.It's not like those who receive them actually tell the truth anyway,so what does it really matter?
895259641764098055 2017-08-09 12:25:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Every darn bit of it.
895249308328525825 2017-08-09 11:44:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Independent @SafetyPinDaily And this dude right here is so clueless that he's ok with that.
895248378661130240 2017-08-09 11:40:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum You David, no longer belong in the "conservative" party. Defect, save yourself.

895101971165851660 2017-08-08 01:58:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 And they say that Muslims use their religion for Jihad. Exactly how is this any different?

895035978280304640 2017-08-08 21:36:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @wiredrealestate Trump doesn't have shit in his sights.

895026861947977733 2017-08-08 21:00:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @trytostopJane Yes, I can totally understand why you feel that way. Ignorant traitorous trump would be very hard to respect as a soldier, for sure.

894902001720377344 2017-08-08 12:43:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @LaurenWern Oh boy, I'm sure it will be an instant classic. I wonder how many of his twisted base have been negatively effected by opioid abuse.
894900836395917314 2017-08-08 12:39:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @MrDanZak @ALT_uscis @Eat_Shop_Travel I'm going with, no f***ing way!

894893728032202752 2017-08-08 12:11:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarionBurr5 @nycsouthpaw All very good suggestions, he won't do any of them.
894871064567742464 2017-08-08 10:41:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @FCC Please don't let Sinclair buy the additional channels. The limit on the # of stations one company can own is for great reason!!!
894758269549330432 2017-08-07 03:12:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump That's not how it works when the crazy one controls the purse strings. Nobody has the nerve to try because of the $$$.
894756300424323076 2017-08-07 03:05:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @SLandinSoCal No, hate speech is the same old hate speech.

894679726337470466 2017-08-07 22:00:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @silkie_izzy Yes I agree. Somehow I didn't really get how profound and pervasive this was. It's gross.
894679031156748288 2017-08-07 21:57:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl It's old man hater dude stuck in young man's body. Very, very sad. How's your legal case going Jake???

894676456751628288 2017-08-07 21:47:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump This is your idea of a"working vacation". Jesus, Mary & Joseph you are a pitiful excuse for a president. I knew you'd be terrible but really
894675391239081984 2017-08-07 21:43:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Hey Crazy Pants, they have talked about it.

894619800261074947 2017-08-07 18:02:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @wazupblondie Good to see Rs are starting to distance themselves from Crazy Pants. Also ignoring him more & more.

894602130371301376 2017-08-07 16:52:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @wazupblondie Dem here, Not me. I'd rather see Crazy trump there until we flip the house. Pense actually means all the crap trump says & he's capable. NO.
894600893475282945 2017-08-07 16:47:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnBlecka @MMFlint Got It!!!
894598198693638144 2017-08-07 16:36:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlanDersh @FoxNews @WVmatt Funny. "Human race" statement & then MAGA. Yea, that dog don't hunt Matt.
894597196544450560 2017-08-07 16:32:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlanDersh @FoxNews A failure like all of the Benghazi & email investigations into Hillary were?Yes, they're looking for something Alan & there's plenty to find
894594550395699201 2017-08-07 16:22:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuddLegum It's revolting to see how low these people will go. Should be free Chick-fil-A.
894592205389787136 2017-08-07 16:12:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomPerez Any chance DNC will change their slogan? Sorry but it's terrible. Should put it to Twitter to come up with a good one.
894590702411239424 2017-08-07 16:06:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @ThisIsWhyTrump @realDonaldTrump Yes
894590582580031488 2017-08-07 16:06:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyraDSirois1 @ChelseaClinton Ummmgoes without saying.
894575740691337217 2017-08-07 15:07:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila Saw trumpians on tv saying they still support him but would like to see him focus and know policy specifics. Bout like Obama turning white.
894566456695951360 2017-08-07 14:30:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @HWGilbert57 Yes it is pretty,some parts anyway.Loved seeing McConnell fail on healthcare.He has reputation for leading.Just for obstructing it seems.
894564969584492545 2017-08-07 14:24:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @PassarelliAllan @scottinclearh2o Oh God, that is sick.
894563952419536896 2017-08-07 14:20:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @HWGilbert57 Christie is so bad! I can't believe there was actually a time I thought he seemed half way decent. I kind of thought he seemed honest-bahaha
894563019832913920 2017-08-07 14:16:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @HWGilbert57 Indivisible group did just put up a billboard against him recently, here in Louisville. Baby Steps.
894562126857195520 2017-08-07 14:13:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @HWGilbert57 Oh he wouldn't dare. He does payed stuff only. He's so bad. KY is a poor & poorly educated state. McConnell sold out many years ago.
894561482289139712 2017-08-07 14:10:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @AJ_Ski_Bum @OathKeeper101st @LeslieRoss23 It's a trumpism thing for sure.
894560735585546240 2017-08-07 14:07:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @Hillaryh4444Hos @AJ_Ski_Bum Kaleigh is one of my least favorite trump pundits. She is a Harvard educated lawyer, wtf???
894559758312669184 2017-08-07 14:04:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @AynRandPaulRyan Sick. Really sick. It just keeps getting worse. Trump brags of liking it "rough".
894559104596889601 2017-08-07 14:01:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @HWGilbert57 He's not up until 2020 so a lot could/will happen before that.
894558740111818753 2017-08-07 13:59:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @HWGilbert57 Lol, I'm not new & not good. Yea, I can't stand him. Will def work hard to help defeat him. Hoping his RUBLE use will help with that cause!
894558097452265472 2017-08-07 13:57:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Compared to your colossal lies, the Senator is a choir boy. You're really deluded!
894557847639478273 2017-08-07 13:56:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Really still this one? You really need some new "material"!!!
894557675337510916 2017-08-07 13:55:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump How's your Russian Oligarch buddy visit going?
894556687650222080 2017-08-07 13:51:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Actually it's IMPOSSIBLE to believe.
894556530674204672 2017-08-07 13:51:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Oh you mean the SICKO RALLIES you keep holding. Seemed like the only thing the lackeys in WV liked was the old tired "lock her up" crap, SAD
894555558702919680 2017-08-07 13:47:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Oh you mean the one you routinely give exclusive interviews to? Sure, like we believe you?
894550128408879104 2017-08-07 13:25:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @HWGilbert57 I can't seem to figure out what you're referring to here? Anyway, yes he's a Senator here. He's the worst.
894316135172255744 2017-08-06 21:55:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterPrunski @thehill At his "nursing home" he'll get three squares a day.
894238444452532224 2017-08-06 16:47:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @Discon1948 No, I vote for Saudi Arabia.
894227339609075713 2017-08-06 16:03:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytimes @VP Bullshit Pence, ye doth protest too much. Your followers may believe you but we Hoosiers know exactly who and what you are. Trump beware.
894008424337473539 2017-08-05 01:33:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @scottisbell_ @DerrickCathey3 Bahahaha
894008335393050628 2017-08-05 01:32:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DianaMiller5 @scottisbell_ He's an idiot & he will be impeached by then.
893967403448664068 2017-08-05 22:50:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @MarkDice @Justin09074894 @james_shireman @SPMorrison_ Maybe that's because we have had few issues.
893960219956568069 2017-08-05 22:21:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @calvinstowell All the hate is tough on the looks, clearly.
893948689856823298 2017-08-05 21:35:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @bravenak Playing the race card.
893948613474340864 2017-08-05 21:35:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @bravenak I'm sorry to say but I agree with you. That's why they keep
893899070602960898 2017-08-05 18:18:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @Mihero @DearAuntCrabby @jcoppenhaver That has not been my experience.
893898006898122756 2017-08-05 18:14:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @MyraDSirois1 @DearAuntCrabby Agree. I've tried. It's like they have a missing gene. True narcissism.
893884758438150150 2017-08-05 17:21:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila @vavrek_james Not just looks. He's full of hate.From affluent family and so much resentment. He represents the worst in this band of Mobsters.#NaziHater.
893882028206297088 2017-08-05 17:10:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @bill_auclair Man, what could go wrong there. After the Mooch, at least they're considering someone who is calm and level headed 
893879664569135104 2017-08-05 17:01:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @YesforHillary @mitchellreports How different is that from your experience with Sec. Kerry?
893795796021387264 2017-08-05 11:28:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw No but I heard he "got a call from the head judge who said he could"..
893794364031479808 2017-08-05 11:22:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix I cried in Walgreens parking lot (like I'd lost a loved one) Womens March was stake in ground for me too. United We Stand. Fuck Trump!
893791975350075392 2017-08-05 11:13:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou When it was founded.
893694694156361729 2017-08-04 04:46:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @Deebauch Yep, I said it was going to be a shot show. Only surprise is how many didn't see this immediately.

893659637588918272 2017-08-04 02:27:15 UTC <HenslerKate> But this Democrat either Robin. That's a deal breaker for me.
893657708817248256 2017-08-04 02:19:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @jefftiedrich Same.
893655519520534528 2017-08-04 02:10:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Alan sold out quite some time ago.
893652553359122433 2017-08-04 01:59:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw I feel very sorry for his liberal Jewish parents.
893622507109892096 2017-08-04 23:59:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @slmustain1 "Patriot" never would have guessed

893591953761349635 2017-08-04 21:58:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Wyatt_3T_1G You're the one following a crook yet I'm the poor soul, whatever. Family & faith first, yet worship a guy who loved neither.
893590212605095936 2017-08-04 21:51:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix He's afraid to go to NY.
893589680108777473 2017-08-04 21:49:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @Wyatt_3T_1G Brilliant defense.
893551418065342464 2017-08-04 19:17:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @MarkDice @james_shireman @mattmani The RW propaganda pushes that.They link Christianity, Patriotism, Gun Love, Racism, Xenophobia & hard work. Must embrace All or "UnAmerican"
893549426102476800 2017-08-04 19:09:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @831silvercat @58isthenew40 They seem to be a little intimidated don't they? I guess truth is scary for those who define their own "facts". Reason wins in a democracy.
893507151993479168 2017-08-04 16:21:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @jmartNYT @danpfeiffer Listening to you on yesterday's' Pod at the gym right now! "Trump is still trump".

893499970527080448 2017-08-04 15:52:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Were they named in the pee pee dossier?
893499121851674627 2017-08-04 15:49:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @atDavidHoffman That's right David. We won't let the gun toting redneck haters scare us off.

893484040371687424 2017-08-04 14:49:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @NewDay @JohnAvlon Bahahaha whatever!!! Cons seem to think everybody is as dumb as their base. Not so folks, not so!!!
893483122662277125 2017-08-04 14:45:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @MarkDice @james_shireman Lowest approval rating this early in presidency ever-"winning"!!!
893482804666880000 2017-08-04 14:44:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @ShortleyJames Your picture is a bit scary.
893481957337821189 2017-08-04 14:41:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @Wyatt_3T_1G Seriously Wyatt, how does someone who says faith and family are first support The Don? He's a lying, cheating crook.
893480285802835968 2017-08-04 14:34:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahsMimi @quinncy Judge Jeanine, omg, really? Wow, she pretty much tells you all you need to know about Faux News. She's like a parody of a News person.

893475411572781056 2017-08-04 14:15:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealJamesWoods @tribelaw Pretty sure his mind left his body about 10 years ago.
893473272855240704 2017-08-04 14:06:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind This plus the pressure of the Grand Jury  smashing down on him. Should be a totally new level of crazy. Don the hazmat suits, toxic levels.
893458249843965953 2017-08-04 13:07:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder @LouiseMensch @TrueFactsStated @counterchekist @officialnmp @PamelaChavers @MyraDSirois1 @Helenhs @CatFanatic9 His "base" may still & always be with him, but those who pretended they backed him because he was "the candidate" know what's going down.
893457279965683716 2017-08-04 13:03:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder @LouiseMensch @TrueFactsStated @counterchekist @officialnmp @CatFanatic9 @PamelaChavers @MyraDSirois1 @Helenhs I couldn't take the trump train crap on Facebook. Funny, crickets from those folks now.

892796052243460096 2017-08-02 17:15:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag @McFaul Michael, he does "understand" he's "doing" exactly what Putin wants him to do. Maybe you missed this but he's Putin's friend.
892780054828257280 2017-08-02 16:12:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterPrunski @DaShanneStokes Not just arrogance but really a total disconnect from reality.
892778727553335296 2017-08-02 16:06:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk Clearly, the only thing he contributed.
892778464322912256 2017-08-02 16:05:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk I'd love it if someone was able to ask him a question regarding specifically how it is "unconstitutional".
892776782159544320 2017-08-02 15:59:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @GeorgeTakei God, no way my father would have done that. But then he was a doctor and a liberal, so he was ethical.
892769185557860358 2017-08-02 15:28:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Should be some interesting fall out.
892768936164544512 2017-08-02 15:27:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianlol1 No offense, but you seem to have an issue with using "your" for "you're". If you mean to say you are, it's you're, not your.
892750367603253248 2017-08-02 14:14:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper Please don't confuse Eric with the facts.

892737235619110913 2017-08-02 13:21:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Oh so he's finally made that "pivot"? Sure, when pigs fly.

891777784636420096 2017-07-30 21:49:26 UTC <HenslerKate> Hillary had a lot of haters that voted for trump that prob would have voted for any other Dem.
891777381408616450 2017-07-30 21:47:50 UTC <HenslerKate> Many of those you're referring to as racist vited for Obama. I would have voted for Biden.
891775916447346689 2017-07-30 21:42:01 UTC <HenslerKate> I think Biden would have gotten a lot of the redneck vote that trump gotb
891771814690664448 2017-07-30 21:25:43 UTC <HenslerKate> I do think Biden would have won for sure
891771342558810117 2017-07-30 21:23:51 UTC <HenslerKate> Yes I do t love Bernie either. I don't know why Dems have been hesitant to say it was stolen but women haven't really said it either

891767388961746944 2017-07-30 21:08:08 UTC <HenslerKate> I agree. But why do you blame that on White heterosexual male Dems?
891767147302723585 2017-07-30 21:07:10 UTC <HenslerKate> I would vote for Schiff
891766695853002753 2017-07-30 21:05:23 UTC <HenslerKate> Who is they??
891764694905753600 2017-07-30 20:57:26 UTC <HenslerKate> I see your answers now.I really don't agree. I'm sorry to say. I think it's critical that Dems run someone that has a good chance of winning
891764214595039234 2017-07-30 20:55:31 UTC <HenslerKate> Why not?

891065949935337472 2017-07-28 22:40:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @dcexaminer @RWPUSA Yes total sleaze ball nut job. Maybe he fits right in?
891065314611523584 2017-07-28 22:38:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro Ummmm no, he may think he has but he hasn't.
891040630276853762 2017-07-28 21:00:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Bahahaha I win!!!!
891038390090641408 2017-07-28 20:51:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepSpeier Gee I wonder why???
891032249461821440 2017-07-28 20:26:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @ruthbenghiat Mobster mentality much?
891031977406681091 2017-07-28 20:25:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA I'm going with Reince for 500$.

891005210998525952 2017-07-28 18:39:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickyDavila I mean really, what does Donny being president say about the Republican Party?
891004196161560581 2017-07-28 18:35:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Well now that he's taken care of ISIS & Obummercare he can work his magic on Chi town. "What could they have to lose?"
891001904045723649 2017-07-28 18:26:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @Discon1948 Totally Oblivious. Or perhaps he doesn't like his worshippers in wheel chairs. He likes them able bodied.
890997092805738497 2017-07-28 18:07:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @politicalwire Caption: Bought by a stooge.
890957493953867776 2017-07-28 15:29:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger Party doesn't seem terribly important to them either. Just Money$$$
890957259810975746 2017-07-28 15:28:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRubinBlogger Seems to me it's really Money Over Everything. So they've elected Monty Hall to be President.
890945553353388034 2017-07-28 14:42:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Coin_Gracie Last time I checked being a member of the LBGTQ community did not result in a DSM-5 diagnosis. Maybe it's different in the "center right" 
890945157717164033 2017-07-28 14:40:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @Coin_Gracie But you're cool with all of the free viagra those soldiers ingest, I'm sure.
890944748311240705 2017-07-28 14:39:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @Coin_Gracie Oh, you mean you're like most Cons, all you really care about is reducing your own taxes? Shocker.
890943944959328258 2017-07-28 14:36:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Couldn't agree more. Even if they don't yet know it.
890943190022459392 2017-07-28 14:33:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @Coin_Gracie What does this even mean?
890941015888187395 2017-07-28 14:24:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @IndivisibleMoCo @JohnKasich Governor, you were the only R candidate of any substance. You once again proved that via your healthcare stance. Thank you for caring enough
890938851400851457 2017-07-28 14:15:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Are you just getting this memo? A day late and a dollar short.
890938447208345600 2017-07-28 14:14:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress I'm so NOT sorry that you weren't able to screw 200,000 people in Kentucky over last night. 2020 can't come soon enough, bye bye Mitchy!
890937396732284929 2017-07-28 14:10:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Coin_Gracie Coin your idea of "center right" is a bit off, thanks for the follow but no thanks!
890929861593837569 2017-07-28 13:40:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @boru2308 @kylegriffin1 Gee how far we haven't come. How anybody watched this man & voted "yes" I'll never understand.
890927038873427968 2017-07-28 13:28:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA @jonlovett That's right Jon. Slow and steady wins the day!!!
890919297345835010 2017-07-28 12:58:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @RemusJLupin2017 @Rubeus_Hargrid @Dumbledore2017 @snape2017 @porpentina2017 @txmockingjay @QueenieG2017 Love it!
890918344999804928 2017-07-28 12:54:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @atDavidHoffman No way, that baby is way too cute for Turtle man McConnell.
890915694593835009 2017-07-28 12:43:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @watzgoinonhere @American1765 Yes, the nerve of those three to actually care about the health and well being of their constituents. Crappy Con=Good Person!!!!
890914613591760897 2017-07-28 12:39:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump This is despicable.Did you even know what they were trying to pass?You have not disappointed,you're every bit as terrible as I knew you'd be
890913945648865280 2017-07-28 12:36:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DC_Resister_Bee She's tough! I like her a lot
890778596318605312 2017-07-27 03:39:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro Why do you have such shitty friends?
890753767951532032 2017-07-27 02:00:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk I'm totally cool with that.
890746765439369216 2017-07-27 01:32:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @therealLAVALLEE @WestWingReport Yea sure 
890714200443629568 2017-07-27 23:23:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs Too bad somebody young & cool doesn't have a Pod Cast & can reach out to Millennials to get them to go Progressive Dem.  Cons must go.
890701835186708480 2017-07-27 22:34:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA They probably had an Ethics Lawyer at that point.
890697507063431169 2017-07-27 22:16:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm No way it's Scarface.
890696547146629120 2017-07-27 22:12:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag Omg Barf!!!
890658156740714497 2017-07-27 19:40:26 UTC <HenslerKate> Rand is pitiful excuse for a doctor, Congressman, and human being.
890656925494280193 2017-07-27 19:35:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @DHStokyo Funny, the fact that what he says is completely rational and of sound reasoning greatly alarms me. We all know how you RWnuts love your guns
890653299908661248 2017-07-27 19:21:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @sethmoulton @TrumpSlide_2020 Rep Moulton served his Country. He's earned VA care which is not "cushy healthcare" trumpcare is no healthcare-tax to rich. Do your homework
890652130926882816 2017-07-27 19:16:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @tenax666 @ColMorrisDavis Thank you Sir for having the decency to speak out. This administration is NO FRIEND of the military.
890651588485926915 2017-07-27 19:14:20 UTC <HenslerKate> Yes Freedom to Die.
890627511918272513 2017-07-27 17:38:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @JonJusth @GovHowardDean I like Mike Levin. Sure hope he cleans his clock, as my Dad used to say.
890607708566462464 2017-07-27 16:19:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill Now that ROCKS.
890603871990669312 2017-07-27 16:04:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @TomiLahren You are gross.
890603436848291843 2017-07-27 16:03:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @Indivisible_KY3 Way to go folks!!!
890602478130962433 2017-07-27 15:59:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @jennycohn1 Quite a legacy, no wonder he keeps a very low profile.
890593382241849345 2017-07-27 15:23:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobinRWSauls @repjohnlewis We stand with you Sir. We will not stop fighting.
890591888482467842 2017-07-27 15:17:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @TINAHILLSTROM1 You need to stop bleaching your hair, your brain cells are all but dead dear.
890590788639485952 2017-07-27 15:12:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @watzgoinonhere @CNN Old Lindsay has no idea regarding that Holy Hell.
890589241020952576 2017-07-27 15:06:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @TheRickyDavila By dreaming of their dirty Russian rubles, no doubt.
890583264708218880 2017-07-27 14:42:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @danibostick All talk. He'll step in line,he always does. If we're waiting for the Republicans to stand up to this assault on Democracy, then it's over.
890580300618768384 2017-07-27 14:31:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @voicefeed @AynRandPaulRyan That must be the last straw. The final assault on our Democracy.
890565585603637248 2017-07-27 13:32:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @alexstubb We are trying Sir.
890564078741196800 2017-07-27 13:26:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AtomicElbow1 @martinmincali @LadyTetta Doesn't seem
890564004296495106 2017-07-27 13:26:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AtomicElbow1 @martinmincali @LadyTetta Fundamental to Christian faith, only if you accept Christ as your savior do you go to heaven. That just Doubt seem very "Christian" to me.
890563684002615296 2017-07-27 13:25:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AtomicElbow1 @martinmincali @LadyTetta Totally understand what you're saying but they sure think they are. I've always felt that many (not all) religions are pretty hypocritical.
890562887005208577 2017-07-27 13:21:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @martinmincali 110% Martin. It's the "Opiate of the people" and you know how Americans like their opiates.
890561365412392966 2017-07-27 13:15:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs Bahahaha
890559425106333700 2017-07-27 13:08:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald @LawnoveN @LeifHanson7 @Telecordial I shall miss the decent winters, the poorly educated racists, not so much.
890558905146900480 2017-07-27 13:06:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou For these guys, money is power, more money, more power. It is bazaar to me.
890557068809314305 2017-07-27 12:58:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @mmpcatz @ChrisLu44 Bevin Tea Party Bevin has 200,000 people in KY who will suffer & some will die, he's cool with that. BTW, he's a Big Christian.
890554364523401217 2017-07-27 12:48:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @KatheleenMitro @IronStache lol that's a lot of likes Randy. Sure hope Someone is copying Paul Ryan on this. "I Love It".
890553036451532801 2017-07-27 12:42:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton Every darn day.
890546215481479168 2017-07-27 12:15:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @kimyaf Very true and wrong. I'm tired of wrong.
890542223699435520 2017-07-27 11:59:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @koolkaryn @Cycle4 I think their brazen disregard for truth is closely tied to their propaganda avenues. They totally own the fact that their lies are believed
890541547674116096 2017-07-27 11:57:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @koolkaryn @Cycle4 I agree to a large extent. There is some chance that their lying cult is proceeding  as though they own it and they don't.
890540401718853632 2017-07-27 11:52:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @euchreman1022 @jonfavs Yes, a cult of poorly educated extremists who lie as easily as they breath. They are taking our Democracy into the gutter with them.
890538357415178246 2017-07-27 11:44:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Each day just a little lower until there's just no coming back. Honestly,I don't care about his "base" there's a reason we call them "base".
890530073203421184 2017-07-27 11:11:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald @LawnoveN @Telecordial @LeifHanson7 Well if it comes to that, I'm going North!
890529688254337024 2017-07-27 11:09:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @kurteichenwald Yes, it was completely repulsive. Not funny, entertaining, or appropriate. If Obama had done that, they would have locked him up.
890497750340689920 2017-07-27 09:03:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @Caitlyn_Jenner Well well. Lay down with dogs, And wake up with fleas.
890420731951099908 2017-07-26 03:57:00 UTC <HenslerKate> Mhttps://twitter.com/joncoopertweets/status/890332827895705600
890415505701556224 2017-07-26 03:36:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Wow.
890410861147430912 2017-07-26 03:17:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @xenonlit @AJentleson Do y'all suppose if we wrapped the WH in Saran Wrap for a week the inhabitants would kill one another off?
890406749748023297 2017-07-26 03:01:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @TeaPainUSA I'm right here watchin. Bring it on #Dolt45, the Resistance is ready.
890402418541854722 2017-07-26 02:44:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @7thdaughter1 @gigikite Bahahaha No!
890402095827996672 2017-07-26 02:42:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @7thdaughter1 @PrODiiGY_SmAsh @Marsha1951 @julesbydesign Funny, none of those are under investigation. Hillary was & they cleared her. BHO never an issue. Trump & Kremlin Crooks-Hell Yes!!! ENJOY!
890371086076043265 2017-07-26 00:39:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @AidenWolfe Sadly true.
890358313581465600 2017-07-26 23:48:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @KitterleCathy @TheEllenShow In other words, Totally Trumpian.
890349781180141568 2017-07-26 23:15:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @frenchette4232 @DaShanneStokes What he did in front of the Boy Scouts was yet another National embarrassment. Sad that the backlash seems to be pretty minimal. Revolting.
890315587519488000 2017-07-26 20:59:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @josephamodeo Pitiful excuse for a president,
890312575992426496 2017-07-26 20:47:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @StollmeyerEU We do too but the Despot in Chief didn't get that memo. Pence lied to him and he's too out of it to know.
890305258211209220 2017-07-26 20:18:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Bahahaha Too Late
890252666030493696 2017-07-26 16:49:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @atDavidHoffman @GmaGlitter Oh yes I do too.
890247526728646657 2017-07-26 16:28:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @atDavidHoffman Building on that. "I don't have mine but maybe if I vote with the rich guys I'll get rich too"
890246839869558786 2017-07-26 16:26:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 @AwardsDaily I'm in.
890228764088692736 2017-07-26 15:14:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @TPThompson2 @magpiejan 100 % correct. That's how the "good Christians" convince themselves that turning their backs on the needy is what God intended.  Very Wrong.
890228049974898691 2017-07-26 15:11:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @teenytinyflame @ShaunKing See, many are nit uneducated. Just ignorant.
890225419944943616 2017-07-26 15:00:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @dawnresist @nicolenavega So painfully obvious. Worked like a charm.
890224463580712960 2017-07-26 14:57:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix Robot Barbie & Ken suck.
890219980863803393 2017-07-26 14:39:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Analisa_Swan @DaysLeft4Trump And counting.
890219154950770688 2017-07-26 14:36:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @JustAGuyFrom330 So true. I can just hear Faux & friends going on about how much better it is here since the well went in.
890189479469862913 2017-07-26 12:38:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @teenytinyflame @RogerJStoneJr God you're really gross. Sure hope you go to jail!
890188761686003712 2017-07-26 12:35:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @ananavarro Capito, not so much!
890184929836978177 2017-07-26 12:20:00 UTC <HenslerKate> Donald J. Trump is what happens when you elect a mobster president. Not good America, not good at all.
890180269206097920 2017-07-26 12:01:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @TheRickyDavila I feel the same way. That's when I was convinced there was something really wrong with that. Wtf?
890178298025848834 2017-07-26 11:53:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @lisamurkowski @realDonaldTrump No Sir, she actually did her job. Her constituents will love & respect her for it. You should try it sometime.
890069659655000064 2017-07-25 04:41:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @FoxNews @indthinkers Definite bot!!!
890069492180582401 2017-07-25 04:41:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @FoxNews Bot?
890068991535960064 2017-07-25 04:39:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @FoxNews Just one of the many completely false statements trump makes on a daily basis.
890059977255247874 2017-07-25 04:03:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @Discon1948 Yes I've read some about that. Hopefully they'll get it done sooner rather than later.
890058255640268800 2017-07-25 03:56:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @Discon1948 Yes, me too. Today, I just started to think. Maybe we're already there?
890056847281008640 2017-07-25 03:51:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @Discon1948 He Sneiderman (sp) really seems to be eager-live how he tweets. Why do U suppose trump wasn't nailed sooner? In years gone by?
890056408598708225 2017-07-25 03:49:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Discon1948 Typically I do too but today, I really started to wonder. There are so many Cons who seem to be compromised. They have accepted so much.
890054299895648256 2017-07-25 03:40:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @txmockingjay He is truly despicable.
890053586494914560 2017-07-25 03:38:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahKSilverman @cmkahuna @FantasyB_tweet Never would have guessed.
890053344907145217 2017-07-25 03:37:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahKSilverman @cmkahuna No kidding. How do many people not see that?

889850555576832001 2017-07-25 14:11:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @ScottDougan1 To say nothing of his despicable politics. Tea party millionaire nut job. Protecting his tax return and crapping on his constituents. Evil.
889850208020025345 2017-07-25 14:09:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @ScottDougan1 Cruz. What kind of a guy has trump say the things about him, his wife & his father, and then turns around and supports him. A Snake.
889849814988587008 2017-07-25 14:08:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @ScottDougan1 Of course, that took crazy trump trying to blackmail him and saying repulsive things about Mika on Twitter. He supported way past rational.
889849388155228160 2017-07-25 14:06:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @ScottDougan1 I have no respect for anyone who continues to call themselves a Republican. Even dumb morning Joe had to admit that.
889848953117827072 2017-07-25 14:04:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @ScottDougan1 Nice for you. Not me. Trump is a nut & con man. Cruz is Harvard Ed lawyer who's a mean hating SOB, very competent though. Pick your poison.
889848484232392704 2017-07-25 14:03:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @ScottDougan1 Not, he's just playing the long game. No respect for him bc unlike many Rs, he is smart, he does see clearly & yet he supports an evil man.
889846620195627008 2017-07-25 13:55:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @sharondigi @Snowfla08935019 We will keep him in our thought.
889845633112317952 2017-07-25 13:51:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @hondo750 Totally agree. I have to question Scout leadership for not having better judgement on this. Trump did exactly what I would have predicted.
889844667164053504 2017-07-25 13:47:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @kevin52850 @VABVOX You may be right. But to tweet about the former Pres in such a dishonest way. Both are repulsive for certain.
889843693011836929 2017-07-25 13:44:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @hondo750 @HolmanTorno @RyanThomasQ @BubblesUp Well it's huge and sullies the Scouts rep- disgusting. Speak out or be judged by the public.
889843343739559936 2017-07-25 13:42:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @hondo750 @BubblesUp @HolmanTorno @RyanThomasQ If it's truly "an amazing organization" then they need to make their disgust with trump public, ASAP.
889842929237458944 2017-07-25 13:41:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @hondo750 @BubblesUp @HolmanTorno What did you think of "his performance"?
889842682025168896 2017-07-25 13:40:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyraDSirois1 @hondo750 It's not all bad, but they've certainly had their issues. Probably just as good as his individual leader really. As a group, rather archaic
889841844812750848 2017-07-25 13:36:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @boyscouts @MyraDSirois1 @MatthewIA03 I agree they should have known.But so should have millions of Americans that voted for him.He's getting much worse every darn day. Losing It
889840114750435328 2017-07-25 13:29:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @rkfatheree Sure, not in a million years. And I'm sure she would not say yes-EVER.
889839747463598081 2017-07-25 13:28:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 Don't hold your breath on that one Jane.
889838963841740800 2017-07-25 13:25:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @NWPinPDX Or a white kid who comes from a decent home who would never say that. Whether they be Ds or Rs. It's just so wrong.
889837951018037248 2017-07-25 13:21:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @kevin52850 @VABVOX Agreed it's super gross. But not sure I'd go with "most embarrassing" I think I'd go with his fake tweet about BHO wire tapping him.
889837399710236672 2017-07-25 13:19:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AynRandPaulRyan I'm frankly surprised he could even come up with his name.
889837156113502209 2017-07-25 13:18:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix We will not do that. We must #RESIST.
889835680901279745 2017-07-25 13:12:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson Weak, for such a strong talker. You clearly see McConnell & Ryan for the amoral Con men that they are. Yet you persist in supporting them.
889834147145023489 2017-07-25 13:06:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @lauferlaw No, we do not stand idly by. #RESIST
889833852574851073 2017-07-25 13:04:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @PantherEyez7 Just like Oz. How's that yellow brick road working out for you?
889832980075687939 2017-07-25 13:01:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson Supported Cruz didn't you? I rest my case.
889832732846632961 2017-07-25 13:00:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @PantherEyez7 Yes, SO MUCH WINNING. Such as???
889832588130570241 2017-07-25 12:59:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @PantherEyez7 Fake. Did you get it from Faux News? Or Info Wars?
889831949237440512 2017-07-25 12:57:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @americana_prime Steve, he's nuts. That's it. He's scared to death because he did conspire with Russia. He also laundered Russian rubles for years. GUILTY.
889831303620816897 2017-07-25 12:54:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @EricStacy Yes because conspiring with Russia and destructing our Democracy is so GREAT.
889831092022378496 2017-07-25 12:53:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @JeffMontes5 What crazy looks like.
889830981191991302 2017-07-25 12:53:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @PantherEyez7 Total nut job.
889830906910920704 2017-07-25 12:53:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @royw07 ???, think much?
889830580321480704 2017-07-25 12:51:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @Realpersonpltcs You do realize this is cult member speak, right?
889830359256453121 2017-07-25 12:51:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii Really, my God Bill, just how damn low will you go? No bottom line what so ever? So gross.
889828340869234689 2017-07-25 12:43:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson Rick you appear to be rational but you're still a dick. I know exactly where I'd like to put my pussy hat.
889826085155766273 2017-07-25 12:34:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @ReignOfApril @Itsallgroovy @Flowerstoall Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely.

889822082955169794 2017-07-25 12:18:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou No, they are far worse. Their minds are intact and yet they stand with him in this total shit storm of a presidency. They know & they stay.
889815699098673152 2017-07-25 11:52:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSchumer Life long Dem. The slogan sucks. No black women present? Step aside please. Let the younger folks lead. Slogan contest to twitter.
889814150137950209 2017-07-25 11:46:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @luluwinks2 @MegMusselman Somebody linked it to Wikipedia I think. I'd never heard it before. It's a Southern thing.
889810418733993984 2017-07-25 11:31:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @JCos01 Sessions is SO far from a Dem. You're either really dumb or crazy. He's a little racist elf from Alabama, he's all republican.
889809453624811521 2017-07-25 11:28:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 Yes I remember her, she wasn't suffering any fools, was she?

889807470654361602 2017-07-25 11:20:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost Trump is deranged. He must go.

889799715621089281 2017-07-25 10:49:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Bahahaha Sir, we do remember what you said about Senator McCain. No "take-backs" on dishonorable statements when you're president. Sorry.
889798404062277632 2017-07-25 10:44:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @remap_the_soul Hell of a lot more than that.

889795473644683264 2017-07-25 10:32:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ronenbergen @pasadenalady63 Ok, turn of Faux News and pick up a newspaper & not National Enquirer. Read it, Repeat. Look at this crazy tweet, he's deranged.
889794502008991744 2017-07-25 10:28:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Wow, this is really getting out of control. You're losing your mind. Leave the WH and go play golf.Decide to resign & let it go Sir. Freedom
889792925093306369 2017-07-25 10:22:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @DianeKovacs @codykeenan @ibbnegtk No, I don't think so. I'm guessing the RNC had a big day in it. He just had enough class to not complain about it.
889701766241112065 2017-07-24 04:20:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA Yousa, give um hell Representative Cummings.

889693598924623872 2017-07-24 03:47:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @Creampuffgal @TeaPainUSA No Doubt About it. Weren't there rumors about this a week or so ago? Do hard to keep up with all the crap flying out of D.C.
889690564425330688 2017-07-24 03:35:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetoORourke @adamcbest That would be awesome. Cruz is a really nasty SOB that needs to be removed. Wouldn't get along with trump-Cruz doesn't get along with anyone
889689379098243073 2017-07-24 03:30:52 UTC <HenslerKate> Presidential Propaganda. Welcome to America. Home of the free. Land of the brave.
889688323308093440 2017-07-24 03:26:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @AdamSchiffCA I happily contributed. I wish we had many more like you, Congressman Schiff. Thank you for your dogged work in this most important battle.
889687643004571652 2017-07-24 03:23:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @AdamSchiffCA Lol "Sleazy" to describe Adam Schiff tells you what an idiot trump really is. Adam's smart and very much a gentleman. He's the Anti-trump.
889683403452407808 2017-07-24 03:07:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @kbrunocrafts @davidaxelrod It is completely perverse. He's a One Trick Pony.

889679246523850753 2017-07-24 02:50:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @DianeKovacs @codykeenan Keep thinking the same thing. But McCain will fall I line, just like he did when they saddled him with Palin.

889652276603834368 2017-07-24 01:03:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @MegMusselman @luluwinks2 It's like they let their very worst take over the party. McCain of yesteryear would not have cowered to them.Well not before a Palin any way
889651377147916288 2017-07-24 00:59:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @MegMusselman @luluwinks2 Music to my ears. I used to have respect for Rs. But since tea party & now trump. Well let's say, they've been dumbed down a whole lot.
889648613923618816 2017-07-24 00:48:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @MegMusselman @luluwinks2 Only women have had enough nerve to stand up to deathcare too.

889648108413517829 2017-07-24 00:46:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @MegMusselman @luluwinks2 Same here. It's refreshing. Some of the trumpers are really crazy vicious. Some guy was making these nasty memes today-with my name in it.
889647220785590273 2017-07-24 00:43:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @jdluntjr It's of course about money. Whether it's insurance or government making the decision it's about money-are you really that simple minded?

889644077737750529 2017-07-24 00:30:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @luluwinks2 @MegMusselman Not do much Dems any more.Rs support of trump has been so gross both before/after election. Second choice-Cruz. That says all I need to know
889643714754334721 2017-07-24 00:29:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @luluwinks2 @MegMusselman I too raised by liberal parents and I still think they were absolutely right. Those southern yellow dog Dems are so much Dems any more.
889642294919536640 2017-07-24 00:23:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @WomanMDsGuide Doesn't really make too much sense but then neither does trump.
889642086726848512 2017-07-24 00:22:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @WomanMDsGuide I asked someone today why "they" seem to embrace that. He said if HRC thought they were Deplorable for voting for trump then he embraced it.
889640382404980739 2017-07-24 00:16:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterPrunski @jpodhoretz Yes maybe they should have a lil convo with Sessions, Comey, Spicer, McMaster, or Rexon just to get an idea about what that's like.
889638968949702662 2017-07-24 00:10:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @luluwinks2 @americastruth1 Thanks I think until the crooks are out of the Con party, that's a good idea.

889627348185878530 2017-07-24 23:24:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @luluwinks2 I really lost respect when he accepted Palin as VP choice. I thought he had more integrity than that. Guess not. Thanks for honest response.
889626488013824000 2017-07-24 23:20:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @luluwinks2 Yea, I used to like McCain but he seems to have lost his moral compass. I think he had a chance if he'd had a real running mate.

889624737269338112 2017-07-24 23:14:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @RandallVC @luluwinks2 How long ago did you switch parties? What made you change? Just wondering, I won't give you a hard time.
889624332833619969 2017-07-24 23:12:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @cre8ivetype @davidfrum Oh yes, very carefully chosen words. Total BS & anyone with any sense knows that.

889619909356990464 2017-07-24 22:54:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @cre8ivetype Omg, nice lady. Manager did a good job of getting her out. Can't wait until these people crawl back under their rocks.
889619007095046145 2017-07-24 22:51:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @BenSasse @chrislhayes Oh yea ole Ben will come through like champ. He's a total hypocrite.
889618293602099200 2017-07-24 22:48:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid So true. Had an exchange today. One started making stupid memes. Mock & Block.
889617609838211072 2017-07-24 22:45:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @HallieJackson @maggieNYT @NBCNightlyNews He is a really, really, really bad man.
889616801067405312 2017-07-24 22:42:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT @markknoller Nice. Great example he set for the Boy Scouts. I hope the Rs are proud of their Supreme Leader. Bet Rexon wasn't too impressed.

889611746062860288 2017-07-24 22:22:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou I agree. Can you imagine what the Cons would do if they had won the popular vote?
889592454701305856 2017-07-24 21:05:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer @emersonhbryant And non War hero because he was captured. Sick minds
889592046394232837 2017-07-24 21:04:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer The level that those people will stoop to is just really mind blowing. I'll bet he was proud of it too. So GROSS.

889583183599198209 2017-07-24 20:28:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @dawnellemurray Every major news source. Even Faux is starting to let the cat out of the bag
889582949410246661 2017-07-24 20:27:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealTomi_Lahren @dawnellemurray Do you support this too? This was really warped.
889582794841759744 2017-07-24 20:27:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @KidRock @dawnellemurray Well I guess after trump, Kid Rock might be the next step down? What about that is conservative?
889582448660623361 2017-07-24 20:25:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @dawnellemurray @dbongino This is dumb, it round be the same here.

889579787903275011 2017-07-24 20:15:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @rieth_damon @Evan_McMullin Well your daddy in law was President, now was he?
889579404682285056 2017-07-24 20:13:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro Bahahaha perfectly stated. It's kind of obvious why he likes to keep his mouth shut.
889579178772877313 2017-07-24 20:12:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RepAdamSchiff @cindyfromindy60 @dumptrump33 @jweyrauch1959 How can u say he's a disgrace if you don't know who he is?
889577241415495680 2017-07-24 20:05:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @KitterleCathy @GeorgeTakei I mean it is so pathetic. And he's the President of the United States. Well of what used to be the United States of America.

889571428189843467 2017-07-24 19:42:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @twizler557 Well, now we all know why he usually keeps his mouth shut!
889569192722214912 2017-07-24 19:33:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @atDavidHoffman Really, he's just taking pot shots bc people like him & he gets more real  on Twitter than he does.
889565562220806145 2017-07-24 19:18:52 UTC <HenslerKate> In louisville KY they'd be strapped but could have ok house and probably squeak by.
889565289377091584 2017-07-24 19:17:46 UTC <HenslerKate> Yea figures. Great place. Super expensive.
889565082413387804 2017-07-24 19:16:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @Varidienne @DeniseJP9 Pretty much sums up our current situation. What's really bad is his trump pretty much checks all of the boxes :(
889564572859891713 2017-07-24 19:14:56 UTC <HenslerKate> That's really sad. They must live in an expensive place?
889564113931776001 2017-07-24 19:13:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag Again sorry. Not that great at this & esp when I'm working out

889562982593810438 2017-07-24 19:08:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @kenklippenstein @tenax666 There's a lot of steel in that boat. Do you think if we had real Pres&real State depart we could spend less on weapons of mass destruction?
889560969218854914 2017-07-24 19:00:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag My point was ($$ & only $$) matter to him so Bible/Torah and even his family do not begin to take precedence over the ole mighty dollar.
889559676693741569 2017-07-24 18:55:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag If you're responding to me you're preaching to the choir! I totally agree. Maybe that wasn't clear
889557158156804096 2017-07-24 18:45:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag You could make him swear on his wife & kids lives and he'd do it in a NY minute. Seriously? Wake up please
889556452607750144 2017-07-24 18:42:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @imillhiser Oh you mean like Mobsters do? Yea, that's pretty much how they are.
889552634507653120 2017-07-24 18:27:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhatAMess2017 Ok you don't have to swear lol! It does sound a bit sarcastic but I've heard far, far worse on twitter! Welcome
889550485207867394 2017-07-24 18:18:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA That's right Comrade and that's exactly what trump wants.
889549715750178816 2017-07-24 18:15:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhatAMess2017 Do you think it's not nice?
889549078945837056 2017-07-24 18:13:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @kylegriffin1 Sick moment. He's the worst excuse for a president ever.
889548027748286465 2017-07-24 18:09:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @summerbrennan I would support it if she didn't constantly lie for her Supreme Leader. But alas, she does so she's not doing women any favors with her lies

889544482072518657 2017-07-24 17:55:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSchumer @nytopinion Schemer needs to go along with the others who have inhabited D.C. For far too long. This from a life long Dem. we need younger Dems to lead.
889542695546265601 2017-07-24 17:48:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @travi44 I'm not one bit sad!!!
889542484803678209 2017-07-24 17:47:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Sure hope it's a whole lot more!

889524653596790784 2017-07-24 16:36:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 Supposed to say, NOT TERRIBLY HAPPY.

889523750420574210 2017-07-24 16:32:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 The Rs want you to believe the evil lawyer thing bc Ins Co & Big Pharma pays SO $$$ to have them say that. And to fight Universal Healthcare
889523403362906118 2017-07-24 16:31:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 You do seem to spew every R talking point. Yes lawyers can bring suits they are not right. But really, isn't it Insurance Co and Big Pharma?
889522283215282177 2017-07-24 16:26:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @SPmilkshake @riotwomennn @mhscott16 Careful or you'll sound like someone who believes in regulating Wall Street

889520012649738241 2017-07-24 16:17:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @Bertrom Evil, he looks EVIL.
889517305926963200 2017-07-24 16:07:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 Like a spoiled 8 year old. His "base" eats that crap up because they operate on the same level.

889512887177404416 2017-07-24 15:49:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 It was a R plan. In what way over reach? Do U agree that R health plan is a tax plan, not health plan?
889509993766166528 2017-07-24 15:38:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @ThisIsWhyTrump @WhiteMotivation Gross. If Blacks said this they'd try to lock them up for sure.
889509464495325184 2017-07-24 15:35:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSchumer @SunflowerSoul71 @wilmajeanne I don't like him either Sandra. What the hell do stupid back stabbing comments like that do? We need to repeal & replace Schumer.

889507255334436864 2017-07-24 15:27:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @guardian @BraddJaffy @judales They've caught his ass lying many times on security forms and yet, it doesn't seem to matter.
889506965679898625 2017-07-24 15:26:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @guardian @BraddJaffy Oh no, it can't be. He seems like such a nice young man.

889503948213760000 2017-07-24 15:14:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 Do you know of people in your world scamming IRS? By not paying taxes appropriately? Because I certainly do.
889503564825063424 2017-07-24 15:12:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 Same here.I think Pres Clinton actually did a descent job of actually trying to address this. Mod Rs & Mod Ds prob agree on quite a bit here
889502818809389061 2017-07-24 15:09:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 @riotwomennn No he thinks "entitlement programs" are free stuff.

889500014099255296 2017-07-24 14:58:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 I've always considered a necessary evil. Taxes, I mean. The mixed blessing of making more money. I think it pays for very important things.
889499664063627264 2017-07-24 14:57:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 I don't think that. We don't spend more than we have in our home. I've never been angry about taxes though. So many people seem to be mad.
889496160087441408 2017-07-24 14:43:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 As a Vet, do trump's obvious ties to Russia concern you? Have you decided that Russia is in step with "White Anerica"? Just trying to get it
889495635665334272 2017-07-24 14:41:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @SPmilkshake @mhscott16 Scott, why do you assume that "Libs" don't have $ or work hard? This seems to be common belief. Trump is ultimate "swamp creature".
889494989516025857 2017-07-24 14:38:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @lrozen Well that's comforting.
889494508697788417 2017-07-24 14:36:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @emilyjanefox Emily you looked great today (not that that's so important) but always nice to hear.
889489552993374210 2017-07-24 14:16:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @selectedwisdom They've been cutting dirty deals with Russia for years. They know exactly how they operate. They operate in much the same way. Like Mobsters
889474357495562241 2017-07-24 13:16:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance @GlennThrush True. It's almost like he already knows exactly why they want to talk to them.
889473665401843713 2017-07-24 13:13:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @RaineyMcdonald I couldn't agree more. How Christians don't see this, I'll never know. It's so repulsive.
889472332535824385 2017-07-24 13:08:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @Nysteveo2AOLcom Ummm I'd run right off of the lot.
889472103384305664 2017-07-24 13:07:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckGrassley Sir, we do not trust you at all. You've shown your true colors. It should be under oath & in public. Sec State Clinton was. This is TOTAL BS
889471630916898816 2017-07-24 13:05:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix @ForeignPolicy Yes, wtf for?
889464733199368192 2017-07-24 12:38:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @EliStokols @SheOfTheMyst Which is why I call him Scarface.
889464493096488960 2017-07-24 12:37:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Peter, seems like you're surprised by this? When BHO beat HRC, it was clear to me that Americans are less racist than sexist. Sad Truth.
889462089869389827 2017-07-24 12:27:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump It begins with you don.
889461836420177920 2017-07-24 12:26:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Really, so glad he cleared that up.
889461071215550464 2017-07-24 12:23:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @EliStokols Bahahaha sounds about right! Quite the catch, that little weasel scarface!
889459431838298112 2017-07-24 12:17:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaredkushner @SebGorka @drose4664 Seb is a Racist Fake who has absolutely no business even being in our White House. Breitbart Liar with Fake PhD. That pretty much sums it up

889313801035755520 2017-07-23 02:38:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @isteintraum So true Molly. They really need to step it up. I'm tired of all of the measured statements. We know the truth & so do they so say it ALREADY
889312161100697600 2017-07-23 02:31:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer I always had such a proud feeling when BHO spoke.Every word was carefully selected & well reasoned.#45 opens his mouth & verbal diarrhea out
889284430799523840 2017-07-23 00:41:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @AprilDRyan @TheRickyDavila Yes she's a very classy lady. Remember trump telling her to schedule meeting with CBC. She even handled that with grace.
889265304634830850 2017-07-23 23:25:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @GeoffMiami @grantstern $$$
889264179617701888 2017-07-23 23:21:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @mhscott16 I do appreciate the fact that you answered
889263496986316804 2017-07-23 23:18:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @mhscott16 Ok. I guess I get it but it's hard for me. Especially military history &support trump. He went to military school & bought his way out duty
889251725454041089 2017-07-23 22:31:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @SheOfTheMyst @JoeNBC It's always the same formula. He really only has a couple of moves in his arsenal.
889248653084422145 2017-07-23 22:19:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @kylegriffin1 Well I mean really, can you blame him? Not that he'll listen any better than daddy 
889246611959951360 2017-07-23 22:11:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @gwrayiv And we stay WOKE!
889246520079527941 2017-07-23 22:11:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @gwrayiv "Trump Logic" is "BROKE"
889245689867374592 2017-07-23 22:07:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA It's movin on him like a bitch.
889228733399392260 2017-07-23 21:00:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSchumer @peterdaou @turbocheetoh What do you mean?
889192566276722688 2017-07-23 18:36:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @tedlieu @dumptrump33 I'm going with Scarface.
889182649167859713 2017-07-23 17:57:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @jaketapper @sunny @tribelaw @AndyOstroy His shameless groveling truly is the same stuff they do in Authoritarian Regimes. He says to the world. It's official. Cons now run the USA.
889179591193096192 2017-07-23 17:45:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @mhscott16 Great! All good. Honest question? Why do y'all so embrace the "Deplorable" thing?
889178695088439296 2017-07-23 17:41:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @riotwomennn @vidbizz Lol he looks like part of the Brat Pack.
889178556307210240 2017-07-23 17:41:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scaramucci @taylorbunnag @riotwomennn What a man of substance this Harvard lawyer. He's very into hair & make up. Said the same to Jake.  However said $$ doesn't buy class-TRUTH
889165779723223040 2017-07-23 16:50:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton Yes, unfortunately for him, the majority of the US population knows that he has no idea what he's doing and would love to see him in jail.
889163288529055744 2017-07-23 16:40:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix But alas, we all know that there's no way trump will sign it. Vlad will not allow him to do that. "Nyet".
889155274644312064 2017-07-23 16:08:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @re_sis_tor As if KY needed anything else to make them the butt of many jokes. I live here, we don't need dumb Kim for that.
889148929790574592 2017-07-23 15:43:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @MrRobotCodeBrkr @CynieLu Same here, couldn't stand Joe's blind support. Mika is a Dem,does not like trump. I guess being black mailed by trump was off putting to Joe
889147505639927808 2017-07-23 15:37:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @re_sis_tor Trash talking trash.
889147285451550720 2017-07-23 15:36:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JoeNBC @mrcase77 @donna_durany @Chrishartradio BS
889146813458128896 2017-07-23 15:34:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @CynieLu @MrRobotCodeBrkr Agreed. Water under the bridge. Our Democracy is being challenged for sure. And they are winning. We need all voices possible. Scary Stuff.
889145331727962112 2017-07-23 15:29:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @cre8ivetype @michaelianblack I'd go with three weeks, he's a slippery one that Mooch. It's not his first rodeo.
889142030496129025 2017-07-23 15:15:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @MrRobotCodeBrkr Thankfully,the Cons are so disjointed, even with Supreme Power they've been unable to shove too much through.Lots of bad stuff behind scenes
889140081788932098 2017-07-23 15:08:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @MrRobotCodeBrkr Well that's clear but that's also completely corrupt and dishonest. I hope we're able to really make them pay at the ballot box. Crooks.
889138023828422658 2017-07-23 14:59:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @MrRobotCodeBrkr Yes that's true. At least he did eventually come around and we do need many more. I'm hoping that McCain will finally step up. He knows.
889137505492193281 2017-07-23 14:57:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @FLREBroker123 Mueller is a Republican, so what's your point? We can't help it that more smart people are Dems.
889137212285227009 2017-07-23 14:56:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @MindyPortmann Are you kidding? Not a detriment? World standing sucks, complete chaos here. Heads rolling out of WH like bowling balls. Wake up PLEASE!
889136290079408130 2017-07-23 14:53:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @MrRobotCodeBrkr That's not Joe's strong suit. He supported trump way past rational.
889136018229792769 2017-07-23 14:52:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @nebraskaredrose No darn doubt.
889134711133671426 2017-07-23 14:46:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JoeNBC @mrcase77 @Chrishartradio Is it all the conspiring with Russians or the profound lying that makes you happy about all of the swamp draining? What he does matters.
889133237821472770 2017-07-23 14:40:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @SheOfTheMyst @JoeNBC Yea the Cons were NOT "corrupted" by trump Joe. They got there all by themselves. Leaders like McConnell/Ryan helped a lot. They're Crooks.
889130088758988800 2017-07-23 14:28:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @michaeldweiss Really tells you what a total opportunist he is.Disagree with trump on all of that and yet shills like a champ for him-it's a swamp cesspool
889125790075498497 2017-07-23 14:11:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Rosie @MonicaJORourke @AyeOhKGDoe Take my last comment bAck, what are you, six? And you support trump? Makes sense.
889125499523477507 2017-07-23 14:10:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Rosie @AyeOhKGDoe Wow good one! What are you, eight?
889113054755123204 2017-07-23 13:20:45 UTC <HenslerKate> "The Mooch" keeps going on about how phenomenal trump's judgement is. Helping deny the "whole Russia thing".
889109790739353601 2017-07-23 13:07:47 UTC <HenslerKate> Might need to change "the mooch" to "the leach". He's SO Slimy he makes Spicer seem like Honest Abe.
889107975738200064 2017-07-23 13:00:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @atDavidHoffman @Dobieblue @suzzysmiles2 Because the heads of the committees are all Cons. It's a bad joke.
889107651719827456 2017-07-23 12:59:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @atDavidHoffman Well in their defense. Jr's daddy is the Supreme Leader.
889105589292412929 2017-07-23 12:51:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @Evan_McMullin @RobertWeinber16 How quickly we've gotten to this point?
888948019957301248 2017-07-22 02:24:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @DrJillStein You are a despicable http://person.You sold your sold&backed trump the environment raper. You're a Pitiful person-Putin's People Party
888937904076185600 2017-07-22 01:44:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @VP You lie non-stop. What kind of Jesus do you worship that He is ok with all of your blatant lies? Must be different from the one I know.
888932108059779073 2017-07-22 01:21:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @kellylynndavis Wow good call Kelly!
888931252975403009 2017-07-22 01:18:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow @mezbourian Yes, he's really not rational. And then today's crazy tweets. He is mentally deranged.
888930140289474560 2017-07-22 01:13:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow Or Cancer.
888928174175916034 2017-07-22 01:06:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DC_Resister_Bee @Deeenst They say care suffers but that's a lie. We have by far the most expensive healthcare in the world and ranked about #23 from best. Payed off.
888927784806084608 2017-07-22 01:04:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DC_Resister_Bee @Deeenst Cons fight this because they get lots of $$$ from those companies. Just another example of GOP (GREED OVER PEOPLE) Dr Price/Dr Paul resist
888926918250246144 2017-07-22 01:01:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DC_Resister_Bee @Deeenst Generally they have good healthcare and do much better with controlling prices bc they take insurance Co. out and big pharma out too.
888926528943337474 2017-07-22 00:59:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DC_Resister_Bee @Deeenst Pretty much EVERY other civilized country in the world has some version of universal health. Some is totally free, some sliding scale.
888913829371031553 2017-07-22 00:09:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @JoyArias7 @zach_coffin @AttiePDX @johnchalloran No, he'll go down in shame.
888913544410005504 2017-07-22 00:07:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @JoyArias7 @zach_coffin @AttiePDX "Democracy Day"
888895741699272704 2017-07-22 22:57:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @InlawsOutlaws @TeaPainUSA Yes, sure wouldn't put it past him.
888893149023793152 2017-07-22 22:46:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @MeTV I so loved it. They were all pretty cool cats. One of my favs when I was young.
888886716291047424 2017-07-22 22:21:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Well then, let's get to the bitter end. The longer it goes on, the more damage to our Democracy that is caused. It's a malignant tumor.
888866047108972544 2017-07-22 20:59:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @AllLeftNews @ASlavitt Also repeal & replace"Patriot"from the Rs who have decided that being a red blooded American means conspiring with Russia against Drmocracy
888862612091490304 2017-07-22 20:45:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @USNavy @realDonaldTrump "After dear leader Putin and his Bigly Best fleet of world class sailors, that is".

888860518907342848 2017-07-22 20:37:16 UTC <HenslerKate> Julia was Diane Carroll and was a nurse. Room 222, the lead was a Black teacher and that was his class number. It was so corny but great.
888844209167454209 2017-07-22 19:32:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenBlumenthal They have a lot of "somethings". They have a lot of "somethings" Sir.
888843607733567490 2017-07-22 19:30:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenBlumenthal Absolutely they're proven liars. We know they will not behave honorably. They are Russian Mobsters. They lie for a living.
888842769350963200 2017-07-22 19:26:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bakari_Sellers @downhiller1976 Whatever, that's irrelevant. I still miss it.
888842195616354304 2017-07-22 19:24:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DC_Resister_Bee @Deeenst Because it's not really a healthcare plan. It's a tax cut for their Donor Class. Dems & people won't support that & they know it.
888840128222965763 2017-07-22 19:16:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bakari_Sellers Wait what about Downton Abbey?
888839739708768256 2017-07-22 19:14:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Enough to pay his very expensive lawyers who are definitely working overtime.
888838844002566145 2017-07-22 19:11:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @yashar @RedwoodGirl He might have gotten a better offer to be an International Money Launderer? Rules of law not necessary just willingness to break it.
888824847073202178 2017-07-22 18:15:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChelseaClinton @sooo1antitrump @angry_gram Yes,but I'm pretty sure that's part of the "Administrative State"they're dismantling.Part of the sick master plan.  The War on Facts #RESIST
888822268310302725 2017-07-22 18:05:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedwoodGirl @yashar Little known fact, Kushner is a lawyer, he knows that's total horse shit, and so does Mueller.
888819563495911427 2017-07-22 17:54:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChelseaClinton @angry_gram @sooo1antitrump They also deny the science that says access to contraception decreases unwanted pregnancies. They make stuff up to suit their narrative.
888818834043535361 2017-07-22 17:51:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @letahamilton383 @justinhendrix No just your use of "reckon".  Trump is decompensating before our very eyes. I appreciate your well reasoned words of wisdom. #RESIST
888800063648038912 2017-07-22 16:37:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs Total "Gas-lighting". It Wasn't too long ago that I didn't know what that meant.
888798345325576192 2017-07-22 16:30:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @TeaPainUSA They certainly did write that book.
888797896136683521 2017-07-22 16:28:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol Like a great big neon sign to the whole damn world.

888796519377383425 2017-07-22 16:22:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump Yea he really knows how to "connect" with his worshippers doesn't he?
888794738228416514 2017-07-22 16:15:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @counterchekist @20committee @CORLEBRA777 @tenax666 That's right.They know but they just keep going a long with it. I believe that's called a Traitor not a "Patriot". Ok, "Alt-Right Patriot".
888793880493273088 2017-07-22 16:12:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA @tenax666 Just as destructive at a fraction of the cost. Very Smart War.
888792494640701443 2017-07-22 16:06:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @LCARS_24 @SamHarrisOrg Yes, that's #Cult45. Our Democracy has been successfully seized. All he needed was a couch.
888791361243238400 2017-07-22 16:02:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @Moloknee He was good, I agree.
888790401313910784 2017-07-22 15:58:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @JasonKander Best tweet of the day!
888790167246581760 2017-07-22 15:57:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @atDavidHoffman Ridiculous. I guess when you're a "Con" you are held to "Con" standards, or lack there of.
888788172691439617 2017-07-22 15:49:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @LCARS_24 Yes from Putin, his boss.
888787320874446848 2017-07-22 15:46:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Yes, we struggle to obstruct-stopping you from screwing over the very people that helped elect you. 22 million of them You Kremlin Crook.
888786327583563782 2017-07-22 15:42:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChelseaClinton @angry_gram The Cons are not only "Climate Deniers".
888784459948060677 2017-07-22 15:35:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Sarah, you are our truth teller. Thanks for keeping it real and trying to help others stay Woke. We know because you know.
888782538080219136 2017-07-22 15:27:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff A major step towards truly draining the swamp. Cons love their "Dark Money".  They'll stop at nothing to keep that river flowing.
888781563911180290 2017-07-22 15:23:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @DearAuntCrabby This must be stopped.
888781307488210945 2017-07-22 15:22:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @DearAuntCrabby @grantstern ???

888776387913535489 2017-07-22 15:02:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @PutinRF_Eng @lauferlaw @SueAnnRawlins Oh good. I find her to be particularly gross bc she sold out to trump, the environment raper. It's such a betrayal of her people.
888770035426185217 2017-07-22 14:37:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @PutinRF_Eng @lauferlaw @SueAnnRawlins She does NOT! She's just another Putin Shill. She's on the pay roll too. There's only one "GREEN" Jill cares about. Wolf in Sheep's Clothes.

888765708582219778 2017-07-22 14:20:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP My two Senators are Rand Paul & Mitch Mcconnell. I call them the Double Whammy of Shit Senators. They don't pay attention to calls or people
888765246403481600 2017-07-22 14:18:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP So True. I tried at the gym. Regional manager told me "you don't have to be a member".
888764622295224321 2017-07-22 14:16:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Discon1948 Paul,we know he's not capable of getting over it. He is in full Nuclear Meltdown mode.Related toxic exposure will affect our Grandchildren.
888762878001639425 2017-07-22 14:09:17 UTC <HenslerKate> Not unless the doctor comes with handcuffs.
888756949088686080 2017-07-22 13:45:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @amovicky1 @JuddLegum Barf worthy for sure. Hey North Korea, please come take your Supreme Leader back.
888754137097261058 2017-07-22 13:34:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @danajhidalgo @yashar "So far" kind of like Kellyanne's "not yet".

888752208686321665 2017-07-22 13:26:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @amv333 @RJSzczerba Keep hearing he already has them. Let's hope.
888750641555918848 2017-07-22 13:20:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @waltshaub Sure Walter. They didn't do the right thing coming on so you can totally forget  doing the right thing on the way out! Good One Though.
888750078734868481 2017-07-22 13:18:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs @downhiller1976 Yes he's always been a slime ball. "Conservatives" voting for him just emphasizes the inherent hypocrisy in that two-faced party.
888748793008709633 2017-07-22 13:13:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs @downhiller1976 Absolutely true.
888748076059553792 2017-07-22 13:10:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs it's so out of control. It's a Russian Crook Conglomerate.
888743973958766592 2017-07-22 12:54:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyraDSirois1 @dumptrump33 Bahahaha I haven't seen that. Pretty darn funny.
888741588855345153 2017-07-22 12:44:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @KAdnoub @realDonaldTrump Love the "So Far".
888738672203489280 2017-07-22 12:33:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Here's an IDEA. You will be IMPEACHED. Put that in your pipe and smoke it trump.
888735375040151552 2017-07-22 12:19:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul No funny they haven't. Apparently, those particular leaks are just fine.
888735142222712832 2017-07-22 12:19:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @Unpersuaded112 Yes.
888734985481596928 2017-07-22 12:18:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @AmbassadorRice @McFaul Sad thing is, that whole shit storm with Numb Nuts Nunes feels like it was at least 2 years ago.
888734299549298689 2017-07-22 12:15:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump No Sir, that's been done, nothing there. Moving on to your TREASON! ENJOY!!!
888734051577843712 2017-07-22 12:14:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Nothing there, moving on to your TREASON. ENJOY!!!
888733821197316096 2017-07-22 12:13:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Desperate. You are so pathetically DESPERATE.
888733344116215808 2017-07-22 12:11:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Bull shit. He was "transparently dishonest" because NYT was going to release his emails (Dems aren't so dumb).
888732371339673601 2017-07-22 12:08:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Did Vlad give you his approval because you don't want to make daddy mad. That never ends well.
888730334199730176 2017-07-22 11:59:58 UTC <HenslerKate> Pretty much true. Although I loved "Julia" and "Room 222" in my youth.
888723440399785984 2017-07-22 11:32:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenFeinstein Why before? That's bull.
888580373696962560 2017-07-21 02:04:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @KaivanShroff @Spacec4t @queerBengali Plenty of white women too. It makes me sick but it's very true.
888579958171414528 2017-07-21 02:02:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @CitizenKayS @KaivanShroff AKA The Super Slimy Swamp.
888579060938539008 2017-07-21 01:58:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @jimmykimmel Oh he's so cute! So happy fur you all.
888571830075891716 2017-07-21 01:30:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA What the hell? This is not right.
888569578292482048 2017-07-21 01:21:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @girlsreallyrule @FilmCritHULK We've gone from "I love it" to "I love him".This is seriously messed up folks.We need to demand that Cons in Congress stand up for Democracy
888568297314279425 2017-07-21 01:16:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @girlsreallyrule @FilmCritHULK Thought the exact same thing. Omg, it's official.
888567709696495621 2017-07-21 01:13:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid NFW.
888561237046562816 2017-07-21 00:48:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Agreed. They can't.
888558195416776704 2017-07-21 00:35:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA That's right Honest Mike. Daryl Issa is a total grease ball. He does not rep real people but instead corporate greed. Roof Stalker must go.
888548015123968001 2017-07-21 23:55:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @DF_Edwards Yes, but he's not going to establish it here. We will not allow that to happen in America. We will defend our Democracy. #RESIST
888543740146597889 2017-07-21 23:38:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @DF_Edwards Yes they're an aggressive lot. They can not be trusted.
888505784455266307 2017-07-21 21:07:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol Oh man, that's true. We must demand that Congress stand up to this Regime. We're losing the battle.
888504233569521665 2017-07-21 21:01:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @lilomeRita @kurteichenwald Everything about #Dolt45 is fake.His hair, teeth, taste, waistline, intellect, insight, bargaining skills, honor, loyalty & Patriotism. FAKE
888502671635775490 2017-07-21 20:55:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @lauferlaw Well just how "BAD, SAD & WRONG, does it need to get? Ryan better pass the bill to stop trump from lifting those sanctions. The Traitors!
888491175056990208 2017-07-21 20:09:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxineWaters @wendy_bien @ResistPres @dsgerstel What is this Fast & Furious?
888484741481156608 2017-07-21 19:44:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @DNC @peterdaou @someguynamedg After the HRC situation, I'm all about having a candidate who can win. It seems smarter & much more qualified is not enough. Sad but True.
888471617768235008 2017-07-21 18:51:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC @tenax666 @cramarth Totally, pretty sure he's from central casting.
888471504371015680 2017-07-21 18:51:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC @tenax666 @cramarth Totally, pretty sure he's from central cast
888470483183783936 2017-07-21 18:47:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @DrJillStein @barbiesnow101 Oh yes, the B**** backed him. TRAITOR
888470090554814464 2017-07-21 18:45:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @DrJillStein No Thanks Stein.Everybody knows exactly who &what you http://are.How does "Green Party"feel about your backing trump?Mr gut the EPA
888469055115415552 2017-07-21 18:41:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @LiberalMmama SH Sanders too.
888466036974112768 2017-07-21 18:29:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @brianstelter Brian I can't even believe you said that. REALLY? Get a clue.
888465831478341633 2017-07-21 18:28:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnKStahlUSA That completely ridiculous. Because they know each other?
888465045037993986 2017-07-21 18:25:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @JoeNBC Not constitutional crisis, we are already there. Impeachment, don't punk out now Joe.
888463083546529792 2017-07-21 18:18:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT @krissukristel If true, it has nothing to do with traitor trump. He's going down. Surely you see that now, right?
888452121376550913 2017-07-21 17:34:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarlaMHughes @SethAbramson Hmmm, isn't that interesting, I wonder why? 
888448187631063042 2017-07-21 17:18:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag Yes of course he is.
888444172876861441 2017-07-21 17:02:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @Chancellorpink The only one I trust at all is General Mattis.
888442740257808388 2017-07-21 16:57:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC @RepAdamSchiff He's a partisan hack. He's a Traitor too!
888442087250821120 2017-07-21 16:54:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @MadisonU No way Bannon, this is like Christmas for him. He's "deconstructing the Administrative State" remember.
888441804844150784 2017-07-21 16:53:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul I'm going with Preibus, then Sessions.
888441258846425092 2017-07-21 16:51:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 Not sure it was the worst but it was certainly cruel. He's a very cruel man.
888440460309663747 2017-07-21 16:48:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanspicer @jonlovett @thefaircw Maybe some of the Tommy John's (or whatever underwear they hock) he's probably soiled all of his beyond washing.
888440071858384896 2017-07-21 16:46:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanspicer @jonlovett @santoroski I listen to all.?
888435857576910849 2017-07-21 16:29:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrianKarem @SilverSabre70 And to date, he's pretty much been right. Pussy grabber is Pres. What's that tell ya? We either unite & resist, or we fall.
888435395310104576 2017-07-21 16:27:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrianKarem Yes Brian, it sure seems this way.
888435134927699968 2017-07-21 16:26:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @JasonKander Pretty much says it all Jason.
888434789874880513 2017-07-21 16:25:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT @djlavoie Umm obvious dirt ball with no experience. What could possibly go wrong?
888434531463819265 2017-07-21 16:24:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT If he a has any sense left, he walks today too. It's each man for himself, that trump train is ready to run right off the trestle track.
888433954910613504 2017-07-21 16:22:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @StevenTDennis @CatriantChris Lol, certainly not here in Kentucky.
888432778731298816 2017-07-21 16:17:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee Not even deep down. First thing I think.
888432038247886849 2017-07-21 16:14:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @MEPFuller @StevenTDennis @mandler He's awful!
888431950167502849 2017-07-21 16:14:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @dylanlscott @StevenTDennis @1stbornAmerican That's just wrong.
888431819179384832 2017-07-21 16:13:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @StevenTDennis I'll bet Kentucky would with McConnell, Paul and Tea Party jewel, Matt Bevin, at the helm.
888431309592330241 2017-07-21 16:11:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @dawnresist @StevenTDennis Great plan, wtf?
888430764525842432 2017-07-21 16:09:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @PressSec Well you asked for it, you got it. Breath Sean, it's finally over. It can only get better. Hope you have a good lawyer.
888429652812984320 2017-07-21 16:05:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @americalastnite @Dead_Scrypt Sorry to say, I agree.
888429278056108032 2017-07-21 16:03:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul But we should just forgive & forget? The Russian Active Measures campaign has been very effective. We're in serious trouble, as you two know
888427667191726080 2017-07-21 15:57:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @DNC @peterdaou @someguynamedg Not this Dem, he's too on the fringe for me, for many. That's why he lost.
888427354850291713 2017-07-21 15:56:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @DNC @peterdaou I agree Peter. Sanders wants his cake.., we all must stand together. Sanders is NOT squeaky clean, that's for sure.
888426730796568576 2017-07-21 15:53:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @DarrellIssa @MikeLevinCA Nada
888425992431300608 2017-07-21 15:50:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillCassidy Senator, very lame answer on what happens if trump fires Mueller. U sld know if it happens, mass chaos will ensue. Checks & Balances?? Joke!
888422760053182464 2017-07-21 15:37:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @KellyannePolls @BeverleeHughes3 Bahahaha on Faux. Full compliment of total BS!!!
888422025236271104 2017-07-21 15:34:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @JasonCrowCO6 @BeSeriousUSA Only wish I could vote for him!!!!
888421010617376770 2017-07-21 15:30:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @HuffPostWomen @Bella_Carapella @womensmarch @ResistTheResist "F" for failed in trying to divide us though .
888420586095095809 2017-07-21 15:29:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @HuffPostWomen @Bella_Carapella @womensmarch @ResistTheResist Hope that didn't hurt your very "patriotic" pro "liberty" feelings.
888420201842257921 2017-07-21 15:27:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @HuffPostWomen @Bella_Carapella @womensmarch @ResistTheResist White woman here, get screwed.
888416219572965377 2017-07-21 15:11:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyWchu Sorry to say, yes I do.
888413070653095936 2017-07-21 14:59:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump "A lot of people are saying"
888408143423840256 2017-07-21 14:39:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterPrunski @thehill He did them a favor, he just doesn't know it.
888407053013856256 2017-07-21 14:35:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @mmpadellan Trump & Melania looked very uncomfortable. They are not a couple.
888405867405750274 2017-07-21 14:30:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jeanabella @RVAwonk @dreamcatcher5 I totally agree. If he has any sense (and we know he doesn't) he's working on an exit strategy. He's go down like trump tanic.
888405029375311872 2017-07-21 14:27:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri I don't buy the MSM crap. That's crazy conspiracy stuff. If it works for you, then so be it.
888404595088793600 2017-07-21 14:25:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri Eric, you seem nice enough but your sources are not sound so maybe it's you who needs to find better sources. RT says it all for me. Wtf?
888404029373632512 2017-07-21 14:23:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @eugenegu @danibostick By imported Polish workers.
888403726695886850 2017-07-21 14:22:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Except for all of the Trump crap, that is. I first thought this was a joke.
888402894596308992 2017-07-21 14:18:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DavidCornDC Bahahaha David, you're really pretty funny!
888401620995911680 2017-07-21 14:13:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @CJPatruno @TeaPainUSA @t_pletch Wonderful.
888401441395748864 2017-07-21 14:13:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @obelisklp Oh they will for sure!
888401194967814144 2017-07-21 14:12:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @kpkeane3 Won't have to walk too much bc of so many people.
888401055394017281 2017-07-21 14:11:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Abso F***inglutely. And so will my husband whether he wants to or not. FYI: took charter bus for women's march-worked out well!
888375382080180224 2017-07-21 12:29:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bakari_Sellers I think he left out the word "whitest".
888374031392657408 2017-07-21 12:24:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @JasonCrowCO6 @vavrek_james @BeSeriousUSA Absolutely!
888372666079604737 2017-07-21 12:18:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @cassandra17lina He's got that look, that's for sure.
888369876338966528 2017-07-21 12:07:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 What NUT JOB would give him money for a "re-election" campaign. It's a personal defense fund.
888367191246196736 2017-07-21 11:56:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattyglesias @impoliticaljnky lol obviously NOT.
888366518593081345 2017-07-21 11:54:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @jeadly @mattyglesias But alas, he has not. Pretty sure he was here for both.
888364198165655552 2017-07-21 11:45:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @Salon I hope Mar-A-Lago drops into the ocean soon.
888248068243574784 2017-07-20 04:03:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @HouseCommerce @RepChrisCollins Omg. So wrong what you said about trump admin tonight. More bills signed into law-total crap. We are not tired of Trumprussia. He will pay.
888231007794724865 2017-07-20 02:55:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @Dangchick1 I think it was before that. They allowed trump to do what's he done. They weren't forced.
888225617317171200 2017-07-20 02:34:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri Nope that's crazy website stuff- I assumed that was the answer. RT? No wonder you want to "be friends" with Russia. Thanks for answering.
888224499006455813 2017-07-20 02:29:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri Ok it wouldn't take long to answer that one question so???
888224123746488320 2017-07-20 02:28:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri That's nice. Where did you "learn" the things you've shared?
888223754270253056 2017-07-20 02:27:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri And how do you know this?
888222923164725248 2017-07-20 02:23:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri And how do you know this?
888222641961799684 2017-07-20 02:22:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri That's trump & the Kremlin Crooks. Putin's plan has worked pretty damn well and it must be stopped. It is lawless & Communist-can not trust
888221987394473985 2017-07-20 02:19:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri US has represented and supported Democracy and tried to stabilize other parts of the world that are volatile and unstable. Oligarchy must go
888219888837435393 2017-07-20 02:11:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri How do you define "intervene"?
888219684566441985 2017-07-20 02:10:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri You're nuts.
888218321597997058 2017-07-20 02:05:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri Intervening in whose government?
888217918059761664 2017-07-20 02:03:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri Why would you want to have diplomatic relations with Russia. Why is it good to assist them in Syria?
888217309709512705 2017-07-20 02:01:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri Yes Eric I am. Save your breath.
888213993483010048 2017-07-20 01:48:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri They need to be appropriately dealt with for attacking our Democracy. They are our Foe and anti Democracy.
888213161014423553 2017-07-20 01:44:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri That's bull,diplomatic relations are inappropriate with an enemy that colluded with trump and attached with cyber war & many active measures
888138362258944000 2017-07-20 20:47:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @AGSchneiderman @jdx1138 @bbgenius Many"patriots"say stuff like that. It's something Cons say far too often.Easier to look the other way if you demonize them. We hear it a lot
888129693307875328 2017-07-20 20:13:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @AGSchneiderman @bbgenius Many of these people work. Many women with kids. Sometimes life hands you turds. We don't want them to be homeless if it can be avoided.
888128457867132928 2017-07-20 20:08:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @AGSchneiderman Will Paul Manafort be receiving services?
888123987288403976 2017-07-20 19:50:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @MathiasBromen Proud of my commitment to saving our Democracy. #RESIST
888123752914997252 2017-07-20 19:49:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @MathiasBromen I didn't say I hated them. I no longer associate with them because they believed the pussy grabber tape was faked. Facts are facts,Science
888122959730155522 2017-07-20 19:46:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @SouthwestAir @RepSwalwell Good thing you didn't take his picture and then tweet it and then bitch about  incessantly. We're saving Democracy & AC bitching at Delta!
888122064451772417 2017-07-20 19:42:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @SouthwestAir @RepSwalwell Lol Hope you had one or three, as well. We appreciate your commitment & perseverance in working to help save our Democracy. #RESIST
888121256951730177 2017-07-20 19:39:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @mairem73 So does that mean you #RESIST ?
888119357464756225 2017-07-20 19:32:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @mairem73 Could be. I'm not a huge fan or anything . But I appreciate her spunk and she's smart.
888118846950850561 2017-07-20 19:30:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @mairem73 Well that's good to hear. I know many who did. They got sucked in by Pence & SCOTUS. I find it disturbing.
888116658975383552 2017-07-20 19:21:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur I've been reading about this today. Their loyalty is to Russia, our enemy. I never really understood the whole "Libertarian" thing before.
888113487292936193 2017-07-20 19:08:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @dreamcatcher5 @JoyAnnReid Least of all, him.
888113083922628610 2017-07-20 19:07:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @mairem73 Just wondered bc you seem to feel strongly against Warren and also very Christian. Glad to hear you didn't. Thanks for your honesty.
888110054146162689 2017-07-20 18:55:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @dncpress Sorry big Dem here. The new slogan for 2018 is NOT good. Please consider reworking. It DOES sound like papa johns.
888106145553932293 2017-07-20 18:39:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @BravingRuin @kimwim Let's just say, I did!
888106062682796033 2017-07-20 18:39:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @BravingRuin Not me, NFW.
888105791416221696 2017-07-20 18:38:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost I'm in that half that can't stand it. And damn proud of it.
888103607173693440 2017-07-20 18:29:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnFugelsang Bahahaha brilliant.
888099758778273792 2017-07-20 18:14:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @Fahrenthold FFS, We are no doubt funding that trip. I'm sure they'll rack up quite a tab at trump facilities. I don't know how much more I can take.
888097858855071744 2017-07-20 18:06:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @txmockingjay Man oh man, that's actually certifiable.
888084832953278464 2017-07-20 17:14:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @imillhiser #Dolt45 is so profoundly unethical he would sign a Blank Bill for sure. His followers would cheer his greatness in cutting "best deal EVER".
888083437583814656 2017-07-20 17:09:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellreports @hardball @RaeGielau9 Yea Rae that's not "Alt Right"
888083073853739008 2017-07-20 17:07:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @hardball @Ken_Marks_Esq Yes in fact more than watch Faux News.
888082594843308032 2017-07-20 17:06:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @hardball The very definition of SYCOPHANT.
888070893246840834 2017-07-20 16:19:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @euchreman1022 @Bencjacobs I know, me too. I think if I was in a room with her, I might slap her. She was bought and payed for-no doubt. Only green there-POND SCUM!
888070403083599873 2017-07-20 16:17:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT Just as his interview with Lester Holt, undoubtedly will. Method to the madness?? One can hope.
888070174989012993 2017-07-20 16:16:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT At the very least, he always lets us know what unethical/criminal thing he's considering. So it may very well work against him.
888069742904389632 2017-07-20 16:15:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT Yes I totally get your point. But he's so walled off at this point. His "stupid stuff" might be the final thing that does him in.
888069259854831616 2017-07-20 16:13:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier @JuddLegum Jesus, Mary and Joseph. He is truly a LOON.
888068611218317313 2017-07-20 16:10:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland @jackiecall3 Yes it's ok. Easy cheap place to live.The Tea Bag Gov,Bevin has been doing everything he can to further harm the less fortunate. It's SICK.
888067990511603712 2017-07-20 16:08:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bencjacobs @lizziechit @dix_iechick Oh thanks. Yes I've seen the photos. By that time I was aware of the Russian coup. Stein is a traitor, I hope she pays.
888067569143435265 2017-07-20 16:06:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland @splashy79 I've never liked them but the whole Russian connection has been a revelation for me. Deplorable is just way too nice.
888067242478489602 2017-07-20 16:05:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland @splashy79 You got it. Kind of makes sense. How else could two Senators who consistently shit on poor people be Senators in Kentucky?
888066728525258754 2017-07-20 16:03:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland @jackiecall3 Yes,especially as of late.But we do have a very sweet granddaughter who lives just minutes away. Never really new my grandma, she runs to me
888066195542478849 2017-07-20 16:00:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland @julieco345 Thanks, unfortunately it's completely true.
888065723918110720 2017-07-20 15:59:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT Is it? If they questioned him he wouldn't do them. And allowing him to riff always leads to stupid stuff he should have never said. So???
888064104786792448 2017-07-20 15:52:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @jmartNYT @maggieNYT Wtf? Suck up much Maggie?
888056586459021313 2017-07-20 15:22:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealMuckmaker @EricVeltri By "actions towards Russia" do you mean conspiring with them to steal the presidency?
888045674218094592 2017-07-20 14:39:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnCornyn @dumptrump33 @TheRightHook1 Maybe just a little tone deaf?
888044295323865089 2017-07-20 14:33:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost "The Art of the Nothingburger"
888043953689419778 2017-07-20 14:32:32 UTC <HenslerKate> Total Barf Burger.
888043680854048769 2017-07-20 14:31:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur Oh that's nothing I'm sure. Just a little Cowinkydink.
888042946184040448 2017-07-20 14:28:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @mairem73 Sorry Maire, did you vote for trump?
888040556483538944 2017-07-20 14:19:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @RepAdamSchiff @SenGillibrand @RepJoeKennedy @KamalaHarris @bannerite @BeverleeHughes3 Totally agree Beverly.
888039759536418816 2017-07-20 14:15:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @FLGovScott @marcorubio @clancygavin420 And we have a lot of POOR  in Kentucky.
888039592867364864 2017-07-20 14:15:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @FLGovScott @marcorubio @clancygavin420 That's bad but I forgot to mention our Tea Party Shit Bag Gov, Matt Bevin. CINO who does everything he can to take from poor & give to rich.
888032957138599937 2017-07-20 13:48:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland He's completely corrupt. And he's a Senator from KY. And McConnell is our other Senator. Double whammy of Shit Senators.
888032195037847553 2017-07-20 13:45:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @SheOfTheMyst Those have been taken by CREW lawyers & others but Dems in Congress are powerless bc they don't have majority in either House or Senate :(
888029772831477760 2017-07-20 13:36:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @DMRDynamics @tribelaw Not starting. It's been looking this way for many months. That's because that's what it is!
888028731033473024 2017-07-20 13:32:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier @ddale8 Anybody who thought that JB Sessions had the integrity or strength of character necessary for him to resign, has not been paying attention.
888028573323464704 2017-07-20 13:31:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier @ddale8 Anybody who thought that JB Sessions had the integrity or strength of character necessary for him to resign, has not been paying attention.
888026406499864576 2017-07-20 13:22:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jim_Jordan @RepGosar You are gross.
888020470246891523 2017-07-20 12:59:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @ericgeller Holy Hell it just keeps getting worse. Day after day after day.  It's like "Groundhog Day" meets "Wait Until Dark".
888016494445162496 2017-07-20 12:43:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @tribelaw @DenbrotS Oh he's definitely Putin's useful idiot.
888012599937445889 2017-07-20 12:27:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas No Brian, it's not STUNNING. It is Revolting, Unethical, Despicable, Predictable and Telling, it's completely in keeping with who trump is.
888005843979034624 2017-07-20 12:01:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @carlhurdmba Never Say Never. I hear David Dukes is available.
888005288149880833 2017-07-20 11:58:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenWarren @DavidWohl @JeanneFUUFNFR @mairem73 Marie?

888002536678010880 2017-07-20 11:47:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bencjacobs Well Congress doesn't seem to think so. So you know what you can do with that straw?
888002260445392896 2017-07-20 11:46:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bencjacobs @lizziechit @dix_iechick What's it say about her? Didn't know that.
888002028601061376 2017-07-20 11:45:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @euchreman1022 @Bencjacobs Well ever since she was spotted sitting at that table, I've known she was on the take. Then she backed trump. "Green Party" for trump? SURE!
888000997448183810 2017-07-20 11:41:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @AynRandPaulRyan The very first thing I thought when he said that. So sad.
888000193748238336 2017-07-20 11:38:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @marciaknutsen GOP is nothing but a bunch of unethical opportunists. They are looting our government while trump crashes and burns like the Hindenburg.
887998466898702337 2017-07-20 11:31:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytimes I'm sure they're square now.
887996902104608770 2017-07-20 11:25:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix Oh holy hell. It's hard to always assume it's a lie unless proven otherwise. Narcissists know this and they play on it, every damn time.
887995942468825089 2017-07-20 11:21:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow Yes, I agree Charles. Get her out now. What's hAppening is awful and she needs to go to a better one.
887873506767249411 2017-07-19 03:15:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @JillWineBanks Great job tonight on Lawrence. You always look so nice-just thought I'd let you know :)
887858180662886402 2017-07-19 02:14:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepCummings @imtripptripp He's like a very spoiled little boy. The things he says are so embarrassing. Both to him and to our country. He is the "baby" he talks about
887857516612341760 2017-07-19 02:11:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @BSam2424 I'll be somewhere I promise you that!
887857025555812352 2017-07-19 02:09:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP @EdanClay I fear not. They've done absolutely nothing to inspire any hope.
887855013661376512 2017-07-19 02:01:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @1Jedi_Rey @RepCummings We stand with you sir.
887852254887280641 2017-07-19 01:50:47 UTC <HenslerKate> Yes Robin. I think it's time to begin really thinking in those terms.
887848131232190464 2017-07-19 01:34:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @impeach_d_trump Yes, so do I. I'm so tired of trumpers thinking it's about HRC. No, it's about our Democracy. It's a coup. We have a traitor in our WH :(
887847465046745089 2017-07-19 01:31:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton Kind words. What a refreshing change. You can't buy class. We miss you and so wish it had been a fair fight. You deserved to have won.
887845988915982336 2017-07-19 01:25:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @irinapromo @peterdaou Many of us do Peter. Between Comey and trump conspiring with Putin well, it sure wasn't a fair fight. Yet she persisted. We miss her.
887841539963179008 2017-07-19 01:08:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @BarackObama Now that's what a real President says. We miss you so much sir. Yes give it Senator!
887840907684454400 2017-07-19 01:05:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @BraddJaffy @funder And yet, they still elected that tool.
887823159889715201 2017-07-19 23:55:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @RobertWeinber16 I think Putin is a serious threat. He's amoral and a tyrant-which is what he has in common with trump.
887822010964992001 2017-07-19 23:50:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 @MikemacMacInnes Yea ok I'm done with you folks. Rational thought just isn't your thing!
887820722504073217 2017-07-19 23:45:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 He embarrassed Dems do badly he had to recuse himself from Trumprussia.
887820167148957696 2017-07-19 23:43:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 I like Al Franken. He's smart and funny. What's not to like?
887819906963689472 2017-07-19 23:42:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 @MikemacMacInnes Well,  enjoy your ill begotten win while it lasts.
887811171809669120 2017-07-19 23:07:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 And you base this on what? Of course I would care. Russia is our ENEMY.
887810144574332928 2017-07-19 23:03:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 @MikemacMacInnes Guess you forgot about the 9 hrs that HRC testified.
887807493153452032 2017-07-19 22:52:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 Whatever, I hope your 30 followers appreciate it :)
887807015053123586 2017-07-19 22:51:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 He perjured himself when he testified . Wow, you're really out there Peter.
887805449961185282 2017-07-19 22:44:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 Putin & trump clearly believe in winning at any cost. And so do you. To me, if you have to cheat to win, it's not a win.
887805035882696706 2017-07-19 22:43:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 Clearly , you're one of those who will excuse it, even once there is proof. Really, I'll never understand how people feel that way.
887804412424597504 2017-07-19 22:40:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 Seriously doubt they'll actually do it but we can hope.
887804158962749440 2017-07-19 22:39:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterBurch31 Gee why do you think they're testifying before congress. I sleep well now. Your response is lame. You support a f***ing traitor.
887803448275726336 2017-07-19 22:36:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman @DEAD_P1XL I certainly don't know. I know this, I will continue to resist until our Democracy is safe again.
887802811257413634 2017-07-19 22:34:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 Does it not give reason for pause, that Shaub (WH ethics guy) just quit saying trump admin totally unethical. He was five with W & BHO. Hmmm
887801165886435329 2017-07-19 22:27:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 Lol "silly little meeting"
887801027273117701 2017-07-19 22:27:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 Look at Goldstone's emails? Wtf? He boldly says its info from Russia to help trump beat HRC. Look at who attended the meeting.
887800081294004230 2017-07-19 22:23:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 And we know that how? Because Jr said so. Let's ignore the four blatant lies before that. Remember?
887799805640048642 2017-07-19 22:22:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 Today he stopped supplying weapons to Assad's foes-Little gift for Putin.
887799450109980672 2017-07-19 22:20:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 How many times have you heard trump say he's concerned about Russia's cyber attack? ZERO. He often tries to deny that it was even Russia.
887799112049053696 2017-07-19 22:19:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 I'm less concerned about Russia's meddling than Cons conspiracy & using info to win. Trump cont to conspire. He's clearly compromised.
887798506894884864 2017-07-19 22:17:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 US has taken Russia seriously since Cold War.W & BHO briefly tried to make happy & Putin reminded them both that he's a tyrant-don't trust
887797460143308803 2017-07-19 22:13:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 I never worried or thought about my wrist either, until I severely broke it. How is that relevant?
887797016725794816 2017-07-19 22:11:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 Not too much.Of course, I was aware that Putin was a tyrant and that Russia is a foe. But that was before we had #45 et al conspire with him
887785751852855299 2017-07-19 21:26:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 Let me guess, you like Faux News & Breitbart? The very definition of Fake News. I'll never understand how you folks don't get that.
887785195696533505 2017-07-19 21:24:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg @PeterBurch31 If you prefer conspiracy, that's fine with me. Sick part, your question implies you know it's true. Lay off the Kool-Aid. Putin is our enemy
887784878418391040 2017-07-19 21:23:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg Cyberwar remember? Russia attached our Democracy. Did you know that @PeterBurch31?
887764558902960134 2017-07-19 20:02:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Indivisible_KY3 Great can't wait to see it!!!
887757406461202434 2017-07-19 19:33:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @MrsVSNC09 @taytaytx85 @hstleup Well not sure parents who are going through such a terrible ordeal are the most rational at that time.
887744727826694147 2017-07-19 18:43:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg The Nuke deal that mob boss just approved?
887744571542835200 2017-07-19 18:42:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg Bullshit Con, Con job. Yea, it's horrible that he saw to it that 30m people got healthcare. Benghazi-crazy! How much money/investigation?
887744037284966400 2017-07-19 18:40:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg I wonder how you will explain it away then.
887743903356596228 2017-07-19 18:40:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg I know I can't convince you of this. So I'll quit trying. But know this, the truth will eventually come out.
887743625685348360 2017-07-19 18:39:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg This at the same time they're investigating communication with trump camp and Russians-ridiculous.
887743468109541386 2017-07-19 18:38:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg I do not love Comey at all. His statement RT HRC 11 days before election was coerced by Rudy and NY FBI & completely biased.
887742929829277696 2017-07-19 18:36:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg It was dumb thing to say.Absolutely nothing in 8 yrs that suggests he did anything inappropriate with Putin, or anybody else for that matter
887740475469426691 2017-07-19 18:26:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @MrsVSNC09 @taytaytx85 @hstleup Agreed. However, not sure that loving parents are the ones best equipped to make that decision either.
887734382148169729 2017-07-19 18:02:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg You get a little testy when there's so much smoke, don't you?
887734197485481986 2017-07-19 18:01:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg The same can be said of anyone calling someone a pompous ass. :)
887733992702836737 2017-07-19 18:00:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg No answers?
887733800813383681 2017-07-19 18:00:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg And why did mob boss trump fire Comey? And why has trump, not once, said anything negative about Putin? Why secret meeting with Putin?
887732186434203651 2017-07-19 17:53:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg If what you say is true.Then why have Mueller & team investigating the whole admin?But not any Dems?Cons have all the power why look into Rs
887731360256995332 2017-07-19 17:50:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg Sessions, manafort

887723766658347009 2017-07-19 17:20:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @jkirchick @taylorbunnag @Evan_McMullin Wtf, thanks Faux, Breitbart, trump. Ridiculous and dangerous.
887722956683591680 2017-07-19 17:17:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @PoliticOwlDan I get it and I'm saying so has Rexon. Done/Done.pic.twitter.com/dRFyGe5fsz
887721740318756865 2017-07-19 17:12:10 UTC <HenslerKate> God help us, trump threatening to Dump a GOP Senator for even considering voting his conscience. Despicable. Dump trump the Russian Mobster.

887719623566774277 2017-07-19 17:03:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Lol, you can get two healthcare packages for the price of one!
887717858192576514 2017-07-19 16:56:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Well in his defense, he only has about 200 words in his word bank.
887714494281068546 2017-07-19 16:43:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @MrsVSNC09 @hstleup To what end? It's sounded like it was hopeless. Sad, painful, truth.
887713138044530688 2017-07-19 16:37:59 UTC <HenslerKate> Ihttps://twitter.com/thedailyedge/status/887705705725263875
887711086371328000 2017-07-19 16:29:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Yes, there's a reason they act like old "friends" because they are.
887710111237636097 2017-07-19 16:25:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump Reality Sucks right trump?
887709918593249280 2017-07-19 16:25:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @IronStache @AynRandPaulRyan "I love it"!!!
887708667163881477 2017-07-19 16:20:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @MrsVSNC09 @taytaytx85 @hstleup I think relying on medical advise is best. It's not like they haven't treated that baby. But then I believe in death with dignity as well.
887707974839533569 2017-07-19 16:17:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @PoliticOwlDan He is crippling the state department in every way possible. That is certainly not "within the bounds of acceptable behavior".
887707974638198785 2017-07-19 16:17:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Wow that's really pretty telling isn't it.
887707974457798657 2017-07-19 16:17:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg Ummm guess you missed the Jr met with Russians on June 9? Tip of the ice burg. Kushner met with Russian "bank" wanted back channel.
887692564777840640 2017-07-19 15:16:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @PoliticOwlDan Hmmm I don't. He's seems to be like minded and probably much more capable. Is that better or worse? I'd say worse.
887691933811957760 2017-07-19 15:13:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman @ballet_conrad I didn't say they were all bigots. I said the hardcore base was largely bigots. What pragmatic approach do you suggest?
887689058637549568 2017-07-19 15:02:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman @ballet_conrad Well that's what I meant. But when folks know that you don't embrace racist comments etc then they refrain from using them around you.
887688397304856581 2017-07-19 14:59:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman @DEAD_P1XL Agreed, terribly dangerous in this instance. 100% agree.
887687992386760704 2017-07-19 14:58:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @PoliticOwlDan Ummm yea, do you somehow think we're better with fried of Putin, Rexon?
887687551515074561 2017-07-19 14:56:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram @sarahkendzior I'd forgotten that. Must have been before they totally paraded Romney around like the village idiot. Not surprised about Rohrabacher.
887687038329393153 2017-07-19 14:54:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @GailRNJD @joshtpm Totally 100%.
887686497750716417 2017-07-19 14:52:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas No they'll prob just try to primary them and their sheep will follow.
887685754629050368 2017-07-19 14:49:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg No, opinionated yes, ignorant no. Are you in denial about trump's treason. GOP  being complicit? And you call me ignorant? That's rich!
887685308195713024 2017-07-19 14:47:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman @DEAD_P1XL I know what you're saying for sure but denial is a very powerful thing. So is Hate. So is faith.
887684713481162752 2017-07-19 14:45:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @funder I really hate Paul Ryan's Guts-he too is a traitor. I can't wait to see him dethroned.
887684141344534534 2017-07-19 14:42:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @watzgoinonhere @TrueFactsStated Couldn't agree more!
887683855582449665 2017-07-19 14:41:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @hstleup @MrsVSNC09 @taytaytx85 I'm no expert. But isn't it a degenerative disease that causes great pain? If this were a dog, would you still approve? Why prolong "life"?
887683384297881600 2017-07-19 14:39:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @Walsh7Meg Delusional much?
887683232833167361 2017-07-19 14:39:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton Great idea. Hold them accountable.They totally know. They totally pretend not to. Stop letting them coast. Either Pro America or Pro Russia
887682585849204737 2017-07-19 14:36:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA This is disturbing.
887682036688965632 2017-07-19 14:34:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman @nicholasvirzi @TariqAvery They didn't even believe the pussy grabbing tape, thought it was fake. Even though trump acknowledged he said it! Really?
887681291952549890 2017-07-19 14:31:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman @DEAD_P1XL Most of trump supporters I know are educated. I'm sure they see it's not good but not ready to concede at this point.
887680976981299201 2017-07-19 14:30:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman @ballet_conrad Yes I do.Variety. None liked Obama. No particular reason why. They are silent racist (at least around me) but they know I wouldn't accept it
887665977554501632 2017-07-19 13:30:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @euchreman1022 Yea it's pretty Nutso-wake up folks!
887665552260558856 2017-07-19 13:28:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @StevenKBannon @LouiseMensch Pro-life Conservative? Sure.
887664949887160321 2017-07-19 13:26:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @hstleup You reveal your bias with this statement. Have you never had your private insurance company make medical decisions for you, because I have.
887664282208542721 2017-07-19 13:23:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @PaulRizzo504 Cool, need to jettison that Russian lover!
887664073323794432 2017-07-19 13:23:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @MrsVSNC09 @hstleup He's in the hospital. Are they withholding treatment?
887663961973424129 2017-07-19 13:22:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @MrsVSNC09 @hstleup Why would we allow parents to decide and not medical professionals? That is irrational.
887663721400729600 2017-07-19 13:21:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman @ballet_conrad He did win on the racist vote.
887662226525630464 2017-07-19 13:15:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman There's some of that but also they really really really believe all of their redneck racist crap. Make no mistake about that.
887660978292355072 2017-07-19 13:10:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @PaulRizzo504 Oh God yes, where do I send $$$?
887660369610768384 2017-07-19 13:08:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @tamronhall @ReaganGomez @thehill @FelNez63 @Lynne3v @elegantcoretta Oh good! She was my favorite on Today (before I got SO political)
887659533941841923 2017-07-19 13:04:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump The Cons don't talk about how good it is because IT SUCKS,and they know it. Putrid Pence tried and he was revealed for the Liar that he is.
887658053180456961 2017-07-19 12:59:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Lol, lol, lol.
887656592451174400 2017-07-19 12:53:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABC So it seems.
887656258244923392 2017-07-19 12:51:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA I wonder what % of our Democracy has already died. Also, what is the point of no return?
887655182028419072 2017-07-19 12:47:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @hstleup @MrsVSNC09 Yes it's true & heart breaking but I don't agree that the parents should be able to make decision. Prolonging inevitable doesn't change it.
887651100517707777 2017-07-19 12:31:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @hstleup @MrsVSNC09 There is no "full recovery" in this baby's future. Regardless of where he is.
887650774121148416 2017-07-19 12:30:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @hstleup The decision made in UK about that baby was completely rational. You open yours.
887650371560144896 2017-07-19 12:28:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @nearhere_ @Gatorgirl4vr Wrong. Refused everyday!
887650252332904448 2017-07-19 12:28:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @TODAYshow @SheOfTheMyst @NBCNews Ridiculous. More denial of science?
887648862663573505 2017-07-19 12:22:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABC Yea, kind of back fired.
887646768476848128 2017-07-19 12:14:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABC Yes "intelligent" people who liken their brains to guns and liberals as their ammo. I'd go with"Brilliant" 2A Con Alt-Right.
887645245445484544 2017-07-19 12:08:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABC You post crazy shit bud.
887644498049847296 2017-07-19 12:05:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABC So true. They are very "Black and White" people.
887638929322774529 2017-07-19 11:43:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @VelvetGoldmind1 Oh God yes!
887634735488520192 2017-07-19 11:26:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABC @2000heynow Really, voted for GOP? Prob want to reconsider. They're not to into POC. Just saying.
887634190761697280 2017-07-19 11:24:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABC Lol informed now. Were u "informed" of his secret meeting with Putin at G-20? Or did Faux forget to mention? Informed of Jr's meeting too?

887372891133808640 2017-07-18 18:05:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @ForwardKy @TopherSpiro Kasich should be president. He was the only candidate who was honest. He made the most sense to me from the first R debate.

887366985809616899 2017-07-18 17:42:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost Damn priests are a twisted lot. Can was just be honest about that?
887365360441319424 2017-07-18 17:36:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @robreiner @curtfloodjr Maybe he should have hoped for it on the goodness of most people (more to my liking anyway).
887364489275985920 2017-07-18 17:32:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @robreiner Yes and maybe just a few Rs with a tiny bit of integrity left.
887355350567047168 2017-07-18 16:56:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonlovett Yes let's do it!!!

887348801765335040 2017-07-18 16:30:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @rolandsmartin @booksbygin50 @birdsong47 @Helenhs Pretty sure those were his coke years, not as "political" then.
887347382622580736 2017-07-18 16:24:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @VicLovesAnimals @realDonaldTrump @CandaceYvette28 @anirvanghosh Well that's certainly the way it always turns out.
887338097716973569 2017-07-18 15:47:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @adamcbest Not that Donny attended. Daddy took care of that for him.
887337111589879810 2017-07-18 15:43:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh Nice exchanging with you. Hope you see the light.
887336893129601024 2017-07-18 15:42:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh Yesterday trump claimed that he has added 50,000 mining jobs. Here's the truthpic.twitter.com/D9QWqXmoLK
887336314881929216 2017-07-18 15:40:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @adamcbest But they sure do try.
887335752945860608 2017-07-18 15:38:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh I do already. I don't think you'll like what you find.
887331779669086209 2017-07-18 15:22:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh I think if you did that you'd begin to realize, you're being played. Sorry, but it's true. I call him Don the Con for a good reason. :(
887331378395832321 2017-07-18 15:21:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh Maybe you could use Snopes site to fact check things you see on your preferred sites to determine how often what they say is true.
887331119246565376 2017-07-18 15:19:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh You seem somewhat reasonable in your responses (which I appreciate) sure I won't change your mind but please do give it some thought.
887330816157773824 2017-07-18 15:18:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh I've looked now and things you retreat. Lots of Faux and Breitbart. That is the very definition of "Fake News" turbo. They lie & you believe
887329631740862464 2017-07-18 15:14:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh Trump sold himself as being for the common man.That's just a LIE.He's a very rich man who's clearly "for" other very rich men. Painful truth
887329153888002048 2017-07-18 15:12:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh Would you want to have a doctor treat you that ignores science/research?Because I would not. I like my doctors smart and up to date/research
887328615754543105 2017-07-18 15:10:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh They deny science, research and rational thought. It's really pretty scary. When u embrace "birtherism, deny climate change, economic facts.
887327872704229376 2017-07-18 15:07:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh There used to be smart rational folks who were Republucans. Now they're afraid to speak the truth bc of the tea party but jobs.
887327650158608385 2017-07-18 15:06:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh I know you feel that way but the Cons have really gone with falsehoods & propaganda since Tea Party had tainted all that they do.
887327264186265601 2017-07-18 15:04:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh Hannity is a nut job (drop out).Faux News now #3. Hard to put a positive spin on trump. Faux spends most of their time lying about BHO & HRC
887314494967382018 2017-07-18 14:13:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @grubstreet @Fahrenthold So much winning, "I love it"!!!
887313386693939201 2017-07-18 14:09:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @KamalaHarris Well, that's because you're smart.
887313070611197953 2017-07-18 14:08:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP Really well it's hard to deny it and actually do it :)
887312208857886721 2017-07-18 14:04:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh Hannity for sure.Maddow is clearly a progressive but she definitely has journalistic standards.She's smart and well educated. He's NOT.
887306722800545792 2017-07-18 13:43:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh You know those "News" folks who clearly state they're really just "entertainment" so they have NO standards.
887306437994700800 2017-07-18 13:41:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh CBS

887300781593985025 2017-07-18 13:19:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @Unpersuaded112 Lol, sad but true. As long as they make it trashy, cheap, with no inherent value!
887299817751359489 2017-07-18 13:15:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @Analisa_Swan @impeach_d_trump Certainly in my lifetime.
887299165428088833 2017-07-18 13:13:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh Yes HRC came one hell of a lot closer, Harvard ed lawyer. You just let all of the propaganda and Fake News taint your thinking.
887298158220505088 2017-07-18 13:09:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @amovicky1 @jbarro Exactly. It's ridiculous how many try and say "just get ahead of it". It's hard to plead guilty to sustained Treason & money laundering.
887296834422616064 2017-07-18 13:03:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh I do appreciate your candor about all of the " winning" though. It's been a disaster and looks to only get worse. He duped a lot of people.
887296503416590336 2017-07-18 13:02:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @turbocheetoh Yes, because having a brilliant rational politician HRC would be so much worse that an idiot traitor who is clearly loosing his mind.
887292390729535489 2017-07-18 12:46:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @NBCNews HELL NO!!!
887290843316539392 2017-07-18 12:39:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @bdsudek @rswfire For me, it doesn't get any more important than our very Democracy. He's a Traitor with Russia for pete's sake!
887290241396207616 2017-07-18 12:37:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @bdsudek @rswfire Same, I refuse to hear it. Gave up my circle of friends bc I knew I'd be resisting & they all supported him. Felt too strongly to be civil.
887288806000308225 2017-07-18 12:31:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @rswfire @disqualify_gop Yea it's so disturbing to see how so many just figure they're immune to his wrath. Until they're not.
887288062933426176 2017-07-18 12:28:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @rswfire @reddcurlz lol me too "crazy one" about this. I think those who aren't are crazy. I've never been political but we've never suffered a Coup in my life.
887287174181396481 2017-07-18 12:25:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @rswfire @bdsudek Flat out refuse. He's so repulsive and what his win says about the US. However, I'm convinced he stole the election so it's a bit easier.
887286333428957184 2017-07-18 12:22:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @rswfire Only a handful of times. Yea, way too many who supported agent orange. Just gross to see how many racists I was "friends" with.

887282905873092608 2017-07-18 12:08:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @ReaganGomez @thehill @FelNez63 Yea Tamara would have been so much better! She used to be my fav on today show. Now it's all about politics until we get agent orange out.
887282567069786113 2017-07-18 12:07:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @RiderBabe52 @MzDIS God she was terrible! I never was even able to watch her long enough to see her right wing slant because her delivery sucked!
887281354907537408 2017-07-18 12:02:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill Lol "I love it"
887278994894311424 2017-07-18 11:52:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @gulfgirlee No he's exactly what I expected. I did somehow think that the Cons in Congress had more integrity than this. Drain the swamp? Cons Must Go.
887278269107666944 2017-07-18 11:49:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum @GeneralHealthy Ummm mcconnell is the king of obstructers. He's done lots of damage in D.C. All by himself. He too must go! He's totally toxic.
887277234976849921 2017-07-18 11:45:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @Mynnoe @davidfrum All true. But don't go calling him a Dem. Many Rs have tried. He's catering to the Uber rich and we all know that's what republicans do.
887276332564062208 2017-07-18 11:42:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Yes, dwindle, dwindle, dwindle. Who knew governing was so hard? BHO. Because he dealt with these republican assholes for 8 years.

887144925393018883 2017-07-17 03:00:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @LcrmFirm Same to you. This is such a nightmare I can't imagine not trying to stop these criminals.
887144303172227072 2017-07-17 02:57:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @LcrmFirm Well that sounds like great therapy-go enjoy it. Breath some fresh air and enjoy the moonlight. Thanks again, Great Job.
887141882438004736 2017-07-17 02:48:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @owillis @dodi70 Totally agree. Tamron, I would watch!!!
887141691328798720 2017-07-17 02:47:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @owillis No way I would watch her. First Putin and then Jones. Done-never going to watch her.

887138124144553984 2017-07-17 02:33:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @LcrmFirm On a horse?
887131763662893058 2017-07-17 02:07:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @LcrmFirm I find on-line shopping can be helpful.
887129183301881859 2017-07-17 01:57:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @LcrmFirm That's kind of sad. Go get a drink, work out or take a bath or do whatever helps you refuel-it's well deserved.
887122513561563137 2017-07-17 01:31:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @VP Gross from vp.

886770736681058305 2017-07-16 02:13:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenWarren @DavidWohl And how do we know this to be a fact? Because traitor trump said so?
886769463730876416 2017-07-16 02:08:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @roguecats7 Totally agree. They especially like the Uber rich.
886767987663024129 2017-07-16 02:02:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @ACJJustice I've been bumped off a couple times and have to get security code before get back on in last two days.
886763645912440832 2017-07-16 01:45:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @roguecats7 And also want to be rich white people. Because Donny's "hardcore base" is not rich just redneck white folks.
886762997678473216 2017-07-16 01:42:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou What a fall from grace.They were hawks-protected US from http://Russia.Now it's take their Rubles and conspire to steal our Democracy
886643778072846336 2017-07-16 17:48:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @danibostick @princesssofpwr Whatever, study your bible, pretty sure you missed a few verses.

886630433034838016 2017-07-16 16:55:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @danibostick @princesssofpwr See just like I said, mean Jesus. I don't know him. I recognized the hypocrisy of Christianity along time ago.
886626220984684544 2017-07-16 16:38:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @danibostick @princesssofpwr Only call lairs liars. Cons are full of liars. Anybody who claims to be Christian and attacks on Twitter to be nasty is a Lyin Christian.
886623050078277633 2017-07-16 16:26:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @danibostick @princesssofpwr That's a lot of hate from someone who claims to be "Jesus Saved" I guess the Mean Jesus got you. Poor trumpers, so much mean Jesus.  SAD.
886622162534240256 2017-07-16 16:22:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @danibostick @princesssofpwr Are you a parody acct of trumper? If not, you need some truth serum doll and a little less hate.
886618175646859264 2017-07-16 16:07:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT @Rockmaker2 They obviously have their lil "Lie Sessions" or "email chains" sharing the exact wording of current lie,e.g. "Nothing burger" "transparency"
886617032774602752 2017-07-16 16:02:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT @dayofpresidency @rjr6864 Devout true Christians would not be there.
886604680360599554 2017-07-16 15:13:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Bahahaha Tea. Only 1% to go. "I Love It"

886599419747086337 2017-07-16 14:52:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @chrislhayes @scamptres1 No but Congress spent so much time & money trying to burn her and yet, there's your beloved "nothing burger".
886598009676496896 2017-07-16 14:46:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @831silvercat @tonyposnanski Well Donny only really likes "winners"!!!
886597027848749061 2017-07-16 14:42:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @EricTrump @Dangchick1 @KeithOlbermann "I love it"!
886596154405859328 2017-07-16 14:39:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @thekylestevens @Palladin0 And yet here you are 
886595698564751360 2017-07-16 14:37:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DavidWohl David you're right. Even some Faux Fox News folks are saying trump is a liar & collusion is real. Of course, it's only their real reporters.
886591308227366912 2017-07-16 14:20:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix And lots of "nothing burger" comments.
886590630671114240 2017-07-16 14:17:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Oh God No. They are candy-ass cupcakes who will milk this until the bitter end.
886587308291616768 2017-07-16 14:04:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton @Q_Sociologist @vitalpointstryk Just because you disagree with the News doesn't mean that they're taking the other side.
886586846553280512 2017-07-16 14:02:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton @vitalpointstryk So Wrong.
886576504016121857 2017-07-16 13:21:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @CampaignSift Ummm no, we are speaking the truth and we will continue to do so. Deal.
886575620678983680 2017-07-16 13:17:54 UTC <HenslerKate> Well we don't! That's for sure. The shit slides down from Bevin. Tea-party lying nut job.
886573462004924416 2017-07-16 13:09:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Delta @AnnCoulter @HannaFlint It could just be me, but it almost sounds like Ann felt "entitled" to that seat.
886572405925199874 2017-07-16 13:05:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @danibostick I've tweeted all varieties of responses truthfully. It depends on my mood & level of frustration. I'd be proud if he blocked me 
886570833375879170 2017-07-16 12:58:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @danibostick Well congrats Dani! Lord knows I've tried but I haven't managed to be blocked-YET. What you said wasn't nearly as harsh as what I've said 
886567381811724289 2017-07-16 12:45:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @Delta @AnnCoulter Ann deal with it. Maybe Milo will raise some hell about this for you. You sound like a spoiled 2 year old. Con Crybaby.
886565962996121600 2017-07-16 12:39:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @GloriaSteinem @PPFA @AARP @ACLU @Helenhs Yes, I'm in. It's crazy that we sit around and wait for GOP to see the light. The light is not their friend. Democracy dies in the dark.
886564584181596160 2017-07-16 12:34:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @RepAdamSchiff @bannerite @naretevduorp Excellent suggestion. Press Conferences are completely worthless at this time. Hold one yourselves with actual person willing to respond.
886563484993024004 2017-07-16 12:29:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepHolding @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr @SenWarren @Myomyome McConnell would NEVER have a town hall. It seems his balls are like his chin, NONEXISTENT.
886563133917208579 2017-07-16 12:28:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenWarren @DavidWohl Weak, very weak. Don't you want to get a fake news in there? "I Love It".
886562695473975297 2017-07-16 12:26:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @LcrmFirm @SenWarren Good time to be a Dem isn't it Senator Warren? Pretty ironic. They have complete power and we have soaring momentum and support. #PERSIST
886561809288790017 2017-07-16 12:23:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs @esthersandra With you ladies! You want a "nothingburger"? How about All of the BS lies that trump told his followers? His followers, sheep to slaughter.
886555420927590400 2017-07-16 11:57:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 So much for following lawyer's advice.
886551554161086469 2017-07-16 11:42:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump This looks like a parody account. But then, I guess it is 
886551188682006528 2017-07-16 11:40:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AngeloRayGomez Guess you didn't hear, Don the Con won. Can't defend him by bashing HRC. He's guilty, you're supporting a crook. Traitor Trump.
886550033516154881 2017-07-16 11:36:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Nice using your power in completely inappropriate ways. It's almost like you're a mob boss 
886549524478648320 2017-07-16 11:34:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Lol, even Faux Fox News has begun to speak the truth now. Better get another interview in quick with CBN. He's not long for this world.

886547373597523969 2017-07-16 11:25:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Under Donny, Democracy Dies.

886543140521484288 2017-07-16 11:08:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @bakedalaska Enjoying that kook-aid? Forced by NYT.
886542555743211520 2017-07-16 11:06:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Real News Donny. He sent the email. It's real. You knew weeks before you said. You can't even keep up with all your lies. "I Love It"
886540922992963584 2017-07-16 11:00:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Embarrassing excuse for a president. Sad, Bad, Wrong.

886417981923885056 2017-07-15 02:51:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones You could have stopped at clueless.
886417544453791744 2017-07-15 02:49:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bakari_Sellers Ann is really not a nice or decent person. She drips hate and contempt for others. Who finds that worth listening to? It's so mean.
886416722558947329 2017-07-15 02:46:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @chrislhayes Well the one "volunteered" from Jr. had 100X more incriminating info than all of HRC's & DNC's combined. Thick with irony
886415450120355840 2017-07-15 02:41:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton Yes, it's cruel and it's says who the Republicans really are and who they care about. The associated Lies have been pervasive. #RESIST

886351694501728258 2017-07-15 22:28:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @Discon1948 Pence is an amoral opportunist just like the rest of the Kremlin Crooks in the WH. Lying on demand is a mandatory quality for a job there.
886347159267926017 2017-07-15 22:10:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @rswfire At the same time, Faux News will parade a bunch of Cons out to convince their followers that this is just politics as usual.
886346249296805888 2017-07-15 22:06:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @rswfire Hard to stay away, in the next few hours, maybe Ryan is outed as Traitor or Manafort threatens to have Mueller offed. Who would be shocked?

886339104279015424 2017-07-15 21:38:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance @CGProgram Omg that former CIA guy was so bad with his stupid pictures. He looked like an idiot. Malcolm was charitable with his "disingenuous" comment
886329670110785541 2017-07-15 21:00:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @mokojumbee @GlennThrush lol perfect response.

886293313275531264 2017-07-15 18:36:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarlaMHughes @shiningcity1776 Well I was shocked initially. I've accepted it now. But it is deeply troubling and indefensible.
886290118167998465 2017-07-15 18:23:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kanew Marsha, Marsha, Marsha. I can't stand her and ugly accent. She's lies with the rest of them (I call local office for McConnell-they answer)
886288619132129281 2017-07-15 18:17:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff Heck no. The Cons exempted that because you were responsible for getting in the way of the bag.
886287406894374912 2017-07-15 18:12:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw It's way past Hillary for sure. He's selling our Democracy to a communist killer. #RESIST
886286382167150592 2017-07-15 18:08:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @Offleash2015 @JoyArias7 Sorry I'd go with white backlash to Obama. Lots of haters out there. Used Jesus, Islamophobia, guns & racism to unite them. Very wrong.
886285382089945090 2017-07-15 18:04:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @DCLascelle It is ridiculous that they let them "weigh in". There's truly only one side to that argument. You're either an American or you're not!
886284710900617216 2017-07-15 18:01:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Agreed. Liberal or Conservative should be irrelevant. However, current GOP seems to have an over abundance of wrong. Defect Richard!
886282416322740228 2017-07-15 17:52:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @brithume @ecmprint True enough. That is an argument they're using so I didn't catch that you were being sarcastic obviously. Hearing aid comment not very nice.
886281660345585665 2017-07-15 17:49:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @brithume @ecmprint Oh burn, but I don't have a hearing aid.
886242141508427776 2017-07-15 15:12:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump Certainly in my lifetime.

886230923699773440 2017-07-15 14:28:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram @TeaPainUSA One of your betters, and that sayin a lot.
886230681990434816 2017-07-15 14:27:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @grandmahannah Meanwhile trump prostitutes his three children to help get him elected. Where do you suppose all of the "kids'" kids were as they traveled?

886221505197223936 2017-07-15 13:50:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethN12 @DMRDynamics Agreed. But that doesn't mean that it's not in play.
886217945545932802 2017-07-15 13:36:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @PowerVoiceOver I'm not convinced it's that. I think it's their failure to lift the sanctions. He's toying with them & saying get moving.
886216195384504320 2017-07-15 13:29:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @FriendEden100 @ColMorrisDavis "Details" aren't his thing.

886212962733756421 2017-07-15 13:16:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @jbouie @martnehz Omg, pence is a consummate liar. He drips with insincerity. Remember "we had no contact with the Russians" same on Flynn.
886210993688158209 2017-07-15 13:09:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @jbouie @MeghanPaulas Sad. But any religion to the extreme is dangerous. They don't call it "the opioid of the people" for nothing.
886208960172306432 2017-07-15 13:00:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @FriendEden100 @jbouie It is SO offensive and then he blankets himself in his False Christian Cloak. Desperately trying to strip women of their rights. Damn Judas.
886208005737512961 2017-07-15 12:57:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @DMRDynamics @SethN12 Can you say Emolument Clause?
886206012927201280 2017-07-15 12:49:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @WSJ @238_2425 @mardinejp You look like a want to be Mobster. Hey, I "here" trump is hiring!
886205673004052480 2017-07-15 12:47:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @WSJ @238_2425 @mardinejp Yea right!
886205554036801536 2017-07-15 12:47:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @WSJ @mardinejp Lol, "whole" so trumpian. "Your" funny.
886205341771460608 2017-07-15 12:46:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @WSJ Sorry I read this.It's a lot of bull. Perhaps the editorial board should ask themselves why trump isn't the "maddest" about Russian Hack job
886202240683388928 2017-07-15 12:34:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @4everNeverTrump @AKADonaldTrump @cdnorthbarn Not intentionally but I could see a "truth, you can't handle the truth" moment from our narcissist and truth.
886201597826609152 2017-07-15 12:31:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @KAdnoub @AKADonaldTrump Keep it up so that Traitor Trump does a "press conference". Felt like he was close to confessing when he responded to French reporter.
886200001935937536 2017-07-15 12:25:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @NotThatHilary You could have held at "bad".
886197981380317184 2017-07-15 12:17:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @bannerite @Salon I hope he gets creamed.
886196641350471680 2017-07-15 12:11:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @kimmie8264 @TeaPainUSA Mine was.
886195169325981701 2017-07-15 12:06:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @brithume @ecmprint "Just UnAmerican" oh then no big deal. Nice. Bet you call yourself a "patriot" too. It's is Anti-American, obviously.
886194497654321152 2017-07-15 12:03:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @dandrezner No surprise there-that's entirely different
886193591965626368 2017-07-15 11:59:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @AP Gee this sounds very familiar for some reason 
886191595812511746 2017-07-15 11:51:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @teenytinyflame @RWPUSA How is it that you STILL call yourself a Republican? Even Morning Joe was above that.
886190942046257152 2017-07-15 11:49:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @JasonOverstreet @tshep42 Way worse than Watergate. That was like Jaywalking compared to this.
886188512269148160 2017-07-15 11:39:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @HallvardViken TRUTH. What would you call whole party ignoring painful but obvious truth? Even Faux News has now acknowledged it for heaven's sake. Deal.
886187560497803265 2017-07-15 11:35:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost "Moral rot" well said. I'd say they are beyond. They are AMORAL. Ironic for a party that clings to their Christianity to draw in the sheep.
886186306774204416 2017-07-15 11:30:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Trump is a Charlatan and Simpleton.
886185379631648768 2017-07-15 11:27:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump lol I'm not certain of that but don't look for a women's tourney at Augusta National anytime soon.
886183366361591809 2017-07-15 11:19:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Golf is a pretty WHITE sport as every Country Club in the US proves.
886183057044197377 2017-07-15 11:17:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump But you're point is taken. Do u hAve any idea why more that half of all white women would vote for pussy grabber??? 
886182751757627392 2017-07-15 11:16:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Money. Women don't typically get very high end clubs for tourney. Way less money involved .
886181812451639296 2017-07-15 11:13:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @tenax666 @joberg10 Faux women look like they're going to a cocktail party (bleached hair/Faux lashes)extremely short skirts. NO?
886180938803281920 2017-07-15 11:09:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @tenax666 @joberg10 It's a sexist rule that dictates that women not "bare arms" in Congress. Not that I would expect you to understand or accept that fact.
886178864216592384 2017-07-15 11:01:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @tenax666 @joberg10 Call it what you may. I'd rather have "liberal logic" than "Con Contempt". Do you see no truth to what I said? Faux women "have a look"
886069717487820800 2017-07-14 03:47:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @Hogan80Hogan Absolutely!!!
886066114329006080 2017-07-14 03:33:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @tenax666 Mean while Ryan and the other Cons are busy watching & tweeting Faux News, where most of the females look like street walkers.
886058038049861632 2017-07-14 03:01:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Love it! #RESIST
886056248113868801 2017-07-14 02:54:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @bpolitics @CynieLu Tragic really.
886056143382040576 2017-07-14 02:53:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @bpolitics @CynieLu Our Dem Gov took med expansion, KY poor. Now we have tea party nut job who will do the least possible bc u know, he's a big Christian.
886055668003876868 2017-07-14 02:51:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @bpolitics @CynieLu Yes KY will be very hard hit. Like 240,000 people neg effected. Prob rel. % vote although some do. He's very dug in and gets lots of $$$.
886055117686022149 2017-07-14 02:49:36 UTC <HenslerKate> That's very true. NEVER.
886051576317693952 2017-07-14 02:35:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @a35362 @JYSexton God help us all 
886041858270535680 2017-07-14 01:56:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @DarrellIssa @MikeLevinCA Fake watchdog. Very real dirt ball.
886041286175838209 2017-07-14 01:54:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxineWaters @DeMarko_Gage @alicenmary Yes problem. I don't like nasty racists and you appear to be both. Enjoy all of your "winning" with Traitor trump. I will enjoy his demise.
886017077747867649 2017-07-14 00:18:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxineWaters @DeMarko_Gage @alicenmary Let me guess, trump supporter?
886016777368592384 2017-07-14 00:17:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxineWaters @DeMarko_Gage @alicenmary To each her own. I like it. Do you feel better having shared your ugliness?
885973057445257217 2017-07-14 21:23:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @DebraMessing @mmpadellan @NancySinatra @DrDenaGrayson @AynRandPaulRyan @TheRickyDavila @tedlieu @DearAuntCrabby @JoyAnnReid @joncoopertweets @funder Was not aware of this. I thought it was all about daddy but no, they have all their bases covered. Major crime family.
885955047938547714 2017-07-14 20:11:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA One truth teller at Fox.
885953726200020992 2017-07-14 20:06:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas @LouJujutsu I prefer "expose" them as "destroy" sounds like it's an obsession/nefarious and I think it's pursuing the truth & defending Democracy.
885953127891030017 2017-07-14 20:04:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Sure is, it's just getting better and better. Of course, probably working on his base.
885952637040029696 2017-07-14 20:02:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @robreiner @MilesDaie Not dreaming. It's you who is delusional. Prepare for the inevitable.
885875110460219393 2017-07-14 14:54:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer @MSandersonD Not saying too much.
885874907246211072 2017-07-14 14:53:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer Yea it "slipped" his mind kind of like the birth of my first child "slipped" mine
885871621994672128 2017-07-14 14:40:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Yes I'm sure it does. This is definitely not new. Way too deep for that to be true. It's totally obvious.
885871339361505280 2017-07-14 14:39:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu Ya think Congressman? (acorn/tree)
885871056250122240 2017-07-14 14:38:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas We were there weeks ago. We were questioned by many about what in the heck is going on  it the US? People said they'd visit when it was over
885870635783684096 2017-07-14 14:36:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxineWaters Love you, keep them coming!!!
885869496967331840 2017-07-14 14:32:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bernstein No surprise there. So much money and so much unadulterated Hate. Never thought I'd be glad that I'm not rich but really, I truly am.
885866558391758848 2017-07-14 14:20:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxineWaters EAT IT BOT!!!

885865859058728961 2017-07-14 14:17:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxineWaters Really, pretty sure they deep-sized him.
885864694472421376 2017-07-14 14:12:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid The stewards of SLEAZE.
885856328903790592 2017-07-14 13:39:41 UTC <HenslerKate> Why, why is @SenateMajLdr so anxious to screw 240,000 Kentuckians over with DEATHCARE BILL? Ask the gross Koch brothers. He's the worst.
885853775394734080 2017-07-14 13:29:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @RickyProphete @Pecafan Totally agree. They keep trying to say "be transparent" well that only works if the truth is defensible, but it's not. So keep LYING!
885849789144981504 2017-07-14 13:13:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes Congrats! Bet it's a good marriage.

885848125956657153 2017-07-14 13:07:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @LcrmFirm @greta I tried watching your show. Sure the stink of Faux had something to do with it but mostly I just didn't enjoy your delivery.
885847359116247043 2017-07-14 13:04:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @LOLGOP Not gummy worm just plain old worm. Used to think he was ok. It's been awhile.
885845251059068928 2017-07-14 12:55:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @EmmanuelMacron @realDonaldTrump @EdwardTHardy @euchreman1022 @eugenegu Yes, very true. Thank you doctor.
885844548458618880 2017-07-14 12:52:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @KangasMom1 @tedlieu But, but the women.
885844307030274048 2017-07-14 12:51:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @RWPUSA Just another Trump Mobster.I mean really, they're all a bunch of GD Gangsters in our White House.They must all be excised before more damage
885842086771273729 2017-07-14 12:43:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @JenniferJJacobs @pagalvin Don the Con said he would "absolutely release his taxes" just another Lie.
885840482818981889 2017-07-14 12:36:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton Omg, only Don the Con.
885839784643637248 2017-07-14 12:33:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr @Thomas1774Paine God DJ, you're really a LOSER.
885838593561952256 2017-07-14 12:29:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdHull8 @mmpadellan That's what this is. Like "Goodfellas" or "The Godfather". They are all Mobsters for sure. Better in a movie than the White House. It SUCKS!
885836654732353536 2017-07-14 12:21:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @Lee_in_Iowa @JuliaOdle @DeAnnBlevins Wait I'm looking at Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul-can't top that Shitburger!

885836009518358528 2017-07-14 12:18:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lee_in_Iowa Don't trust them for a second. I believe by the time nightmare is over, even his nutty followers will accept what Lying Crooks they all are.
885834477041221632 2017-07-14 12:12:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Sir what can be done about Faux News? It's totally out of control and it's ruining our country, truly.
885833885317308417 2017-07-14 12:10:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @TheDemCoalition Man, they're the gift that just keeps giving.

885829276641218560 2017-07-14 11:52:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @mcspocky @turbocheetoh Protocol is for people in the WH who do not fully disclose all info correctly on that form to lose their jobs. No "crime" conviction. WRONG.

885643920025284608 2017-07-13 23:35:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Absolutely it could have. Historically unprecedented attack on our Democracy is a hard sell though. You've gone a good job of clarifying it.

885547526631428096 2017-07-13 17:12:37 UTC <HenslerKate> Laughing out loud at the SHADE the French are throwing trump's way. "You'd better do a good job (to Macron) or else you'll make me look bad"
885546675590361088 2017-07-13 17:09:14 UTC <HenslerKate> Omg, trump is such a black mark on our history. Well ok, orange mark. It's unbelievable how completely inept he is. It's Shameful.
885545583292841984 2017-07-13 17:04:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @jaketapper @WontComply No truth hurts, doesn't make it a slam. If u find that hurtful u better get ready for Treason bud. It's going to hurt like a mother....

885544834416750592 2017-07-13 17:01:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @PaulReggio1 Literally said "a lot of people don't know that" (wonder who he was referring to???)
885544155266641920 2017-07-13 16:59:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder @Kimbclay The fact that they're standing with #Dolt45,tells us how deep this is! They're just planning on cheating again next time! We must stop this.
885543707273039872 2017-07-13 16:57:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur @JaneyHill1985 Well that's good. Truth is, I too like some of what Dr. Stein had to say. Then I found out she backed trump. Wtf, seriously off, then Putin
885542427632836608 2017-07-13 16:52:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur @JaneyHill1985 Ummm yea they did. Jill Stein is a traitor too. We'll happily welcome you back! Besides, third party is a wasted vote, in my opinion.
885541668002332674 2017-07-13 16:49:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 Oh God. He might as well have said "You look pretty good for such an old broad". Just when you think it can't get any worse-somehow it does.
885539852426633217 2017-07-13 16:42:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @ADAMPLOW @allisankelly No way, she's 30 years too old for #Dolt 45.
885539314242904064 2017-07-13 16:39:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 @ADAMPLOW Oh god please tell me this is a joke. We're going to have to muzzle him if it's true!
885538566578819072 2017-07-13 16:37:01 UTC <HenslerKate> FYI: I was in Paris France just weeks ago, it's awesome!
885538161379729408 2017-07-13 16:35:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @danibostick Yes totally agree but she's not alone! Sessions, Price, Pruitt, DeVos, Rexon, Mnuchin.....I mean really,  DEPLORABLE was way too nice!
885536537638834176 2017-07-13 16:28:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @danibostick I appreciate all of your effort to honestly share the awful stuff DeVos is up to-she's one of the WORST &you totally Rock your cute haircut
885535151228416004 2017-07-13 16:23:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @DMRDynamics @SethN12 Really good Christians I'm sure.
885533210603597825 2017-07-13 16:15:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @CDelaperriere @TheRickyDavila Ummmm Because they are all dishonest hacks for $ 500
885532414503735298 2017-07-13 16:12:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @McConnellPresspic.twitter.com/mGvFCYJnX5
885528672467341312 2017-07-13 15:57:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNNPolitics @RickSantorum So gross! What if 240,000 Kentuckians want to keep their healthcare?We all know what Paul,McConnell, and Bevin will do! Shut your lying lips
885527482333618176 2017-07-13 15:52:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJFrumPee "Christian"nut job too,
885526424177823746 2017-07-13 15:48:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @NewsradioWJPF @RepShimkus Oh you're part of the Kremlin Klan! Nice, sure hope you sink with that very leaky boat. Each day u pretend not to know, it's more likely!
885524089800196097 2017-07-13 15:39:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @KangasMom1 @mmpadellan Looks like she's afraid he's going for the "P". She's probably scared to death!
885521749252734976 2017-07-13 15:30:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @WilDonnelly @ArtemisDLW That was so funny "yet" take a shower" Kellyanne, you need it!
885521408125792256 2017-07-13 15:28:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @WilDonnelly And yet another new low (even for her) and that's saying a lot. Then again it is Faux News, so dumbing it way down does make some sense.
885520236199505921 2017-07-13 15:24:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @galemiller10 Think he's a member there.
885509499439763457 2017-07-13 14:41:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Yea he's a sell out for sure. Sad, Bad, Wrong.
885498864966434819 2017-07-13 13:59:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @chelseahandler Bahahaha ha when pigs fly.
885498766253580288 2017-07-13 13:58:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @CarlSpoerer2018 He's gross!
885498144175337473 2017-07-13 13:56:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @cajunsicily @ChouardSandrine You're probably right. No matter, trump manages to do himself plenty of harm all on his own (with some Russian help of course).
885492343557812226 2017-07-13 13:33:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @SenatorStrange Oh you mean Golfer in Chief (that shouldn't be hard) trump a "Biblical Miracle" more like "Biblical Plague". You're an idiot and a Fraud!
885488777497645057 2017-07-13 13:19:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC Oh I'm SHOCKED 
885484686050549760 2017-07-13 13:02:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @KellyannePolls @ASlavitt @peaceforus4ever Good one!
885481350442217473 2017-07-13 12:49:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @JeffFlake Really going to sell your constituents out (400,000 +) for a Traitor in Chief. It will be used against you. You may want to reconsider.
885478640271667201 2017-07-13 12:38:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix I'll take that as a yes!
885477816426541057 2017-07-13 12:35:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @cajunsicily No way. Macron seems to enjoy throwing shade, he's good at it and he'll let trump have it!
885477375982653440 2017-07-13 12:33:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @lilysmom1016 @Amy_Siskind @Lee_in_Iowa Fingers crossed. He could hop on over to Russia.
885477103759654912 2017-07-13 12:32:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind I hope they give him a good strong dose of all that popularity.
885462131390500865 2017-07-13 11:33:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @ellensilver3 Seems clear "Patriot" for Rs is code for a lot of other things. Short for racist, sexist, "Christian" Islamophobic, Haters.
885459290710048768 2017-07-13 11:22:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Ding, ding, ding, we have a winner.

885334841247637508 2017-07-12 03:07:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu @Carl_T_Music @Jali_Cat BOT.
885334451915550721 2017-07-12 03:05:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @letahamilton383 @tedlieu Yes of course there are tapes!
885323805618556928 2017-07-12 02:23:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @business @donbrown224 Hey Ben Franklin this is 2017. He won't last his first term. He's an idiot, has dementia and committed treason. What the F part is "winning"
885322802710163456 2017-07-12 02:19:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @sneakerslass @business Well isn't that just great. To hell with pollution/regs,quality schools, improving infrastructure, security, state dept, Vets and HEALTHCARE
885321797834383361 2017-07-12 02:15:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheDemocrats @impeach_d_trump @MikeC_PA6thDist Hillary not so much (unfortunately) bc I think she would have been a good president.
885321503008591872 2017-07-12 02:14:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheDemocrats @impeach_d_trump @MikeC_PA6thDist BHO was very smart but he could turn on the charm in his sermon voice (makes me sad to think about him )
885321204659310593 2017-07-12 02:13:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheDemocrats @impeach_d_trump @MikeC_PA6thDist You have a point. I'm a Dem and I like smart politicians. But they need at least some savvy or approachability and simple message(dumb down)
885320145492729858 2017-07-12 02:09:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump @Artanis71 Sure beats Pres Ryan.
885319633397571585 2017-07-12 02:07:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @AmyOddo @impeach_d_trump Good idea!
885319540820905984 2017-07-12 02:06:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump "I love it"
885317908246736896 2017-07-12 02:00:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @EdanClay Nope recognize the pic.
885317760015847424 2017-07-12 01:59:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @WilDonnelly Oh surely you don't think it has anything to do with trumprussia do you? 
885317060682801153 2017-07-12 01:56:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA I really really really hope you beat that slime ball Mike.
885300861634850816 2017-07-12 00:52:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @cre8ivetype @EricBoehlert He's a total turd.
885295941078724608 2017-07-12 00:32:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @mattinglydm Bingo.
885294501941719041 2017-07-12 00:27:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @Zaitsev1955 What integrity? If they had any, the pussy grabber would not be president.
885292748261257216 2017-07-12 00:20:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Power hungry, also trump has the goods on many of them. Not really much choice. Just ask Ryan and McConnell. Kremlin Crooks.
885251431376326656 2017-07-12 21:36:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenWarren @JohnCornyn @tedcruz @bpolitics @ecclesias @jglewis1983 @amyks_07 I use this sometimes to make it clear 
885248915825717249 2017-07-12 21:26:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @Amy_Siskind @realDonaldTrump @coton_luver @greennomad61 Not me it's pretty clear. He's checking them right off the list.
885235519805960192 2017-07-12 20:32:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @TomWellborn Truthfully, I pretty much believed it was true when I first read about it.
885228735460409344 2017-07-12 20:05:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton Omg and look at him. Is he even alive?
885224422545784832 2017-07-12 19:48:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kris_Sacrebleu Yes, they very effectively used every bit of bate available.
885223395830497281 2017-07-12 19:44:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr @PreetBharara Nope, you've got the right story. Wish you were on the Mueller team. But then I'd sure miss your tweets.
885222735756001280 2017-07-12 19:42:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahsMimi @ezlusztig Totally agree. It's an all out attack on our Democracy. Why are Dems not singing this from the roof tops?
885221848702750721 2017-07-12 19:38:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytimes Oh man that's awful 
885221237244518400 2017-07-12 19:36:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Unpersuaded112 God they are truly bad to the core. Absolutely everything they do is about money.
885219998070972416 2017-07-12 19:31:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT Good question. The only thing we can be sure of is that Jr lies as much as his dad! Dumb.
885214701042454529 2017-07-12 19:10:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @seedswapie @CharlesMBlow Much more true than I would have ever believed True. Many white people are completely disgusted about all of it. Working hard to change it.
885213038332305408 2017-07-12 19:03:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahsMimi Bet loser McConnell could get 5X that but he doesn't have the balls to actually have a town hall. Such a weasel!
885211683093966848 2017-07-12 18:58:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @tenax666 I feel pretty certain Mueller already has it.
885211215286423553 2017-07-12 18:56:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @washingtonpost Did you float this because you have the next size 20 shoe to drop?
885210217880973312 2017-07-12 18:52:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @RepTomReed Donnie not only like to grab pussy, he is a pussy. You should insist he talk to Americans, but of course bc your complicit. Sad, Bad, Wrong.
885209913433182208 2017-07-12 18:51:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @RepTomReed True "PATRIOTS" do Not stand with a criminal calling himself President.
885209706955976705 2017-07-12 18:50:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @RepTomReed Stand up to Treason in the Kremlin Klan or pay the price in 2018!!!
885209294752428032 2017-07-12 18:48:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepTomReed Totally adamant. That lying colluding Russian loving Traitor is NOTMYpresident. What's bad for US is Republicans who won't ACT.
885197812434186244 2017-07-12 18:02:59 UTC <HenslerKate> Just another one if his many lies.
885197522637139986 2017-07-12 18:01:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepHankJohnson Please pass a permanent net neutrality law! Protect citizens & eliminate T2 threat.https://cards.twitter.com/cards/kn0sh/4ir1a
885188141652598785 2017-07-12 17:24:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @JackPosobiec Lie much? You fit in perfectly with the Kremlin Crew. Enjoy all your winning. How's #Dolt45 taking probe? Maybe he could press conference?
885185476533112832 2017-07-12 17:13:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC Senator, how do you know "that lady didn't help them" because Liar Jr said so?
885183987513253893 2017-07-12 17:08:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyWchu @jonfavs Emphasis on GROSS.
885181453004353536 2017-07-12 16:57:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @merlincambion You know he'll say it not against the law, for sure.
885176393058877444 2017-07-12 16:37:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @cre8ivetype @tribelaw And he's still holding a hell of a lot more.
885162218404413440 2017-07-12 15:41:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag @MonikaBauerlein Oh yea for sure bigger nose.
885162090645815301 2017-07-12 15:41:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag @MonikaBauerlein Bigger nose too, it seems.
885161200895623169 2017-07-12 15:37:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @amv333 @adamcbest Just that should be "an impeachable offense"
885160598769631232 2017-07-12 15:35:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepJoeKennedy @angelamego107 @solonl2001 They usually want someone from "fly over country" though.
885160334159466496 2017-07-12 15:34:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepJoeKennedy Dems passed, Cons not so much.
885160092127121408 2017-07-12 15:33:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @taylorbunnag @MonikaBauerlein This must have been awhile ago because she looks "different".
885159910757085184 2017-07-12 15:32:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @ashleyfeinberg Lol good one, and true!
885157175408066560 2017-07-12 15:21:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidaxelrod @artbest1 Yes, but of course he never would.
885157026330017792 2017-07-12 15:20:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidaxelrod @Deedee15644 He doesn't own that at all. Narcissists don't "own" any of their own crap. If they did, they wouldn't keep doing the same shitty stuff.
885156538654101505 2017-07-12 15:18:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidaxelrod @kallywilli I agree Doctor, it's so wrong. The GOP is a bunch of criminals.
885156263868469248 2017-07-12 15:17:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @davidaxelrod @dlong68 He does hAve done seriously empty eyes. I think it every time I accidentally see an image of him.
885155414182178816 2017-07-12 15:14:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidaxelrod Imagine you & me? Yes. Trump, no. He's a total narcissist. It's completely and totally about him. If it's not HIM, it's not relevant.
885153512723820544 2017-07-12 15:06:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland No Obama from Kenya, obvi.
885153112692068355 2017-07-12 15:05:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @JillLawrence @usatopinion @NormEisen "I love it" is my new answer to everything.
885151765468991490 2017-07-12 15:00:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProgressOutlook It's hard to do but I keep reminding myself of this. It's hard to keep up with so much corruption. It begins to blend together.
885146869365690368 2017-07-12 14:40:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @Cechase @kushkandy95 Not sure they typically teach how to break the law in law school.
885144437306863616 2017-07-12 14:30:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @chucktodd That is for sure. MSM needs to start saying this regularly along with congressional Dems. Just spelling it out-the message will spread.
885143379390214144 2017-07-12 14:26:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @Cechase @kushkandy95 I'm at a loss to come up with who is the brightest? Seriously.
885143255834341376 2017-07-12 14:26:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @Cechase @kushkandy95 He is a lawyer-something that doesn't get talked about very much.
885142046352211969 2017-07-12 14:21:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Looking furward to your hearing Jacob?
885141476941889537 2017-07-12 14:19:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Oh no, there's that hate filled old man stuck in a young man's body again. So bitter already so filled with disinformation. Alt Right Too?
885140583584497664 2017-07-12 14:15:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Surely to god your attorneys have told you to stop tweeting. Thank you for always being too dumb to listen Sir.
885137454554066944 2017-07-12 14:03:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @Cechase @kushkandy95 No that email was worse for him than anybody. Bannon wins with this-not joe cool.
885137230918029313 2017-07-12 14:02:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance @joshtpm Totally believe it to be Bannon myself. He'd love to see Kushner's head role. Which will happen. "deconstruct the administrative state"
885136391549710336 2017-07-12 13:58:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow @CarollynSybella Somehow I wasn't aware of their profound hate. I knew they didn't like him but my God, it was truly unbridled hate, wasn't it?
885135636583284736 2017-07-12 13:55:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @rockinrob7970 @CharlesMBlow @TheWorcesterQ White Jesus I'm afraid.
885135157166002176 2017-07-12 13:54:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow @MattWoodTX Yes Matt totally agree.
885134496747663361 2017-07-12 13:51:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahsMimi @CharlesMBlow Totally agree Charles. They also mixed in some Christian elitism, hate of Islamic folks, sexism, and gun love to lock them all in. Truly Sad
885133597577007105 2017-07-12 13:47:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 It's just SO damn CRAZY.
885133415892361216 2017-07-12 13:47:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepJohnYarmuth Support legislation to make net neutrality permanent & eliminate T2 threat to investment.https://cards.twitter.com/cards/kn0sh/4is36
885132633499455489 2017-07-12 13:43:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @take_backUSA Did the house vote to stop trump from reducing the sanctions on Russia or are the still complicit?
885130980683640835 2017-07-12 13:37:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @WashTimes @realDonaldTrump What Washington Times?
885129966857408512 2017-07-12 13:33:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Oh you mean being forced to watch you conspire with Russia to steal the presidency? You are totally correct, Cons are disgraceful.
885129327825780737 2017-07-12 13:30:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Of course they knew. They cheated in every way possible. And many of us have been convinced if this for months.
885126741408305152 2017-07-12 13:20:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @zappin_liberals How u likin all that "winning". Too bad your #dolt45 can't show his lying face in public.
885124228714029057 2017-07-12 13:10:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Thinkers know that when you say "witch hunt". It's the truth.
885123683278352386 2017-07-12 13:08:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump God knows you certainly use it in that way on a regular basis. #Resist the orange putin lover. He's a Traitor.
885120820561014784 2017-07-12 12:57:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @GeorgeTakei I find pence to be the worst because he so channels his inner preacher man. Could "conversion therapy" change him into a good person?
885120187707654144 2017-07-12 12:54:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @ladiesgun @KimberlyEndico5 He wouldn't last long. He's worthless to Putin unless he lifts the sanctions.
885119919939100672 2017-07-12 12:53:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @chrislhayes Because there's no logical explanation for those meetings except he was looking for the "goods" on HRC. She was right all along.
885119565973344260 2017-07-12 12:52:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP @AriBerman More like REPULSIVE THAN AMAZING.
885118347167379457 2017-07-12 12:47:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT @justinjm1 Oh yea that stuff not right either for sure. Kushner is as dirty as his daddy and he deserves more time in prison. Treason sucks!
885117947144019968 2017-07-12 12:45:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @KeithOlbermann Now that's "transparency" for ya.

885098357949116416 2017-07-12 11:27:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @AnglerArcher Yes that my belief. He and Bannon are "deconstructing the administrative state".
884992116119805953 2017-07-11 04:25:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @JasonKander Glad to have Jason working for Dems. We are ready to learn & grow from this nightmare. Stronger together. Thank you Jason.

884850882629820418 2017-07-11 19:04:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @Cheeeekie Me either. No way would I ever dignify trump with the title that he stole from our country.
884850439895830528 2017-07-11 19:02:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig I've been there from day one. That's basically why I went to D.C. for the Women's March. They stole the WH and the Cons were complicit.

884842061995888641 2017-07-11 18:29:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @ThePlumLineGS They knew. Just like trump said about Christie during debate. "He knew, of course he knew". They all f***ing knew.

884815869976694785 2017-07-11 16:45:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @StopTheSpeaker Of course they knew! They were just keeping it in "the family". Family is great, but if your brother commits a murder, it's time to stand up

884804920209268737 2017-07-11 16:01:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @TVietor08 Each second that the Cons sit idly by and stay mute just proves how damn dirty they really are. We need a separate 4 profit prison 4 the lot
884804155994451968 2017-07-11 15:58:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC Omg, I'm so over thinking Graham has any integrity. F***ing "disturbing".

884591357041553408 2017-07-10 01:53:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @tenax666 Too much
884591255283527681 2017-07-10 01:52:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @tenax666 Never Bipartisan here. Always saw Republicans as only concerned about themselves. Hasn't changed much.
884585256602521601 2017-07-10 01:28:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @tenax666 No, the Rs have had precious few impressive Presidents in modern times. I'd say Reagan was a charmer & not to much else. Not their worst.
884578739354521601 2017-07-10 01:03:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @JoeNBC Joe Ronald Reagannwasnt nearly what he was hyped to be. Just another B movie guy really. Welcome to the Dems.
884576990149431296 2017-07-10 00:56:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyWchu @peterdaou Feel the same way. It's obvious he's a crook. I used to believe some of them had integrity. Not any more.
884574697769361409 2017-07-10 00:46:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @FriendEden100 @loveveggieplate Their decision is selfish and not rational. If this baby was a dog we would all agree their decision is inhumane.
884557012884959232 2017-07-10 23:36:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @Michael36776349 I disagree. Tillerson is a disaster. McCain new that during the hearings and let it be known and then he voted for him. Too little, too late
884549742604292099 2017-07-10 23:07:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid I'm pretty sure they'd pay a lot of money for your support.
884537082647072768 2017-07-10 22:17:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @mike_pence Don't you mean the Russian Way?
884536932834922496 2017-07-10 22:16:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @mike_pence #RESIST WE ARE! HOW'S ALL YOUR WINNING GOING?
884536721018417153 2017-07-10 22:16:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @mike_pence Really, how do you even call yourself a Christian and push repealing with no replacement? Maybe you figure you'll be in prison?
884535352135995394 2017-07-10 22:10:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @TeaPainUSA @DenbrotS Lol so true. Man it'd be bad if he were the least attractive and the dumbest.
884523188637630464 2017-07-10 21:22:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @DailyCaller Yea except the are much better liars. So.....

884518093002862592 2017-07-10 21:02:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeterPrunski @VA4Hillary1 I'm going with SHS because she seems to lie with complete ease. It must be hereditary.
884514989234688005 2017-07-10 20:49:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Oh, just realized this could be misinterpreted. I Should have said, we care about you Tea-please be careful!!
884508782738513920 2017-07-10 20:25:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @ananavarro @CDelaperriere @thepoliticalcat Agreed!
884508115084996608 2017-07-10 20:22:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
884505462930112512 2017-07-10 20:11:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @TheDemCoalition Sad but not surprising.
884504984917872641 2017-07-10 20:09:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Seriously, watch your back Tea.
884497809268977664 2017-07-10 19:41:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @JasonKander Resistance Works, Hold Strong Folks.

884488993223651328 2017-07-10 19:06:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @deannapai Lol, best line of the day and maybe week (that's saying a hell of a lot these days).
884431801267171328 2017-07-10 15:19:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @Cernovich Welll that's an obvious lie. Pretty clear you have no heart.
884393933668843520 2017-07-10 12:48:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChelseaClinton FABULOUS!
884373656717099008 2017-07-10 11:28:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @kdrum @MotherJones Surely you jest, he seems like such a nice guy.
884370674856468480 2017-07-10 11:16:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AndreaKuszewski @LyricalDragon @DBrexiteer Plenty but I wasn't quite as clear on his Treason at that time. That's why so many wrong.
884370321234677760 2017-07-10 11:14:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DBrexiteer @AndreaKuszewski @LyricalDragon @BillWinters3 Yea I think you're right. Thanks!

884369822586474497 2017-07-10 11:12:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DBrexiteer @AndreaKuszewski @LyricalDragon But you don't want to hear that do you. He's going down. You Cult45 folks better start preparing for the big fall.
884369061358034945 2017-07-10 11:09:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DBrexiteer @AndreaKuszewski @LyricalDragon Hell no. The guy and his band of thieves are traitors. We want him the hell out of our White House. Wake up. He's a Russian Mobster.
884368635179016192 2017-07-10 11:08:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @AndreaKuszewski @DBrexiteer It was disastrous. Read something real please.
884368100006576128 2017-07-10 11:06:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @jules_su You know it!

884253327978049537 2017-07-09 03:29:56 UTC <HenslerKate> Am I the only one who's had it with Rs saying:The Russians didn't change the outcome of election. Eat it.Of course they did. How he beat her
884252622403883008 2017-07-09 03:27:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @activist360 No Doubt about it. And so are MANY other Republicans.
884251930209472512 2017-07-09 03:24:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @MeetThePress They've told him. He committed treason. He's Putin's minion, he can't go against Putin. Now does it make sense. GD TREASON Senator. ACT NOW!
884251193329012736 2017-07-09 03:21:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @MeetThePress Senator, tell that to the 22m who lose healthcare all together.
884250885123125249 2017-07-09 03:20:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC Senator, answer to your question RT trumprussia. He's a Traitor, colluded with Russia, presidency not legit, impeach now.

884239334110572544 2017-07-09 02:34:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @BenSasse No Senator. It is not. It's more proof of collusion/treason. Deal with it already.
884238607661371392 2017-07-09 02:31:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @BarackObama @chrislhayes @sheepdog98 No that's Hannity, Carlson et al, on Faux News. Chris is a real newsman.

884225932885729280 2017-07-09 01:41:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @DarrellIssa @MikeLevinCA In a New York minute. Hope you kick his ass (in the election of course).
884220754665123841 2017-07-09 01:20:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @alexkotch Flipping keystone cops. Not only are they totally crooked that just flat out incompetent.
884220357359661056 2017-07-09 01:18:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Omg, is this a parody account?

884203970381611008 2017-07-09 00:13:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Sing it Joy. The Resistance is OVER sugar coating their TREASON.
884167258129539077 2017-07-09 21:47:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @watzgoinonhere @TeaPainUSA That, Tea Pain, is what keeps me going. That and your funny tweets of course.
884166508737437702 2017-07-09 21:44:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr Who's laughing now Jr.?
884164069145620481 2017-07-09 21:35:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @euchreman1022 @sarahkendzior Thank you Sarah for always keeping us WOKE.
884155737710219266 2017-07-09 21:02:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC Get ready fir the BS tweet storm!
884150469588856832 2017-07-09 20:41:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT Oh I can't believe that. It's about adoption  like trump fired Comey bc he didn't treat HRC right. Practice w/lies, does not make perfect.
884147385995284480 2017-07-09 20:28:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @JenKirkman Jen I totally agree. It's clearly a Code Red situation. I agree with every single word of your post.
884146110402580482 2017-07-09 20:23:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 No way, he's clearly Royalty.
884143129254875136 2017-07-09 20:12:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @DianeKovacs @DaShanneStokes With a lot of greed mixed in.
884139147996397571 2017-07-09 19:56:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @ItizBiz Many will I'm sure.
884133721888239619 2017-07-09 19:34:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddale8 Not his "norms".
884131163232772097 2017-07-09 19:24:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA And "B I N G O" was his name O.
884128313148624896 2017-07-09 19:13:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind More like down Payment
884126872958849024 2017-07-09 19:07:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @BernieSanders A country that's run by crooked Cons.
884118265596968964 2017-07-09 18:33:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @ThisIsWhyTrump True he would have said "like a bitch".
884115413029847041 2017-07-09 18:21:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @Newsweek @SafetyPinDaily Well of course he does. To bad for 270,000 Kentuckians. He's a Tea Partier, need I say more.He thinks Jesus forgives everything-also he lies
884113941496045569 2017-07-09 18:16:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @JuddLegum @SusanMi25592463 Rexon said so, of course trump lied.
884113272143785985 2017-07-09 18:13:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @irinapromo @JuddLegum Yea only Rexon 
884111418303410180 2017-07-09 18:06:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @sahouraxo @ahacker @ColmGillis Exactly what would be the alternative to "bucking the system"? Oh yea-death. Glad you're not my doctor. R U a chiropractor?
884110976295079937 2017-07-09 18:04:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @sahouraxo @ColmGillis Please. Next you'll try and tell us that majority of slaves enjoyed the hard work & slave quarters provided them.
884110478682861568 2017-07-09 18:02:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @sahouraxo @yazdiham @m_Alyoubi It's the BBC. Would you prefer Breitbart?
884110096619507712 2017-07-09 18:00:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @sahouraxo I wonder who will be representing the USA? Barron?
884108906859036675 2017-07-09 17:56:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @jr_chillin550 @BoilerSandy Another Redneck from Purdue. No surprise there.
884107744298639360 2017-07-09 17:51:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @Honey17011 Just like McCain said "he's a murderer" and then trump said "we're not so good either" and then they elected that Traitor. WTH.
884106018883502081 2017-07-09 17:44:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @melsil @mitchellreports @MegWClayton Or what? Trump will forgive him again and move on? As if it matters.
884105811894689792 2017-07-09 17:43:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @CitizenKayS @mitchellreports Andrea, does it bother you that this is your chosen party?
884105528967909377 2017-07-09 17:42:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @mmpadellan @EtsiSusi That would be Mueller's job.They just keep hiring veteran prosecutors. I wonder why? Get ready for huge disillusionment Suzi. He's a Traitor
884104119644033024 2017-07-09 17:37:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @mmpadellan @TxHillCountry6 Rexon is a Traitor too.
884103881025867776 2017-07-09 17:36:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @mmpadellan Totally agree. I came to terms with that months ago.I stopped being "shocked" or"devastated" which was actually a good thing. TRAITOR 4 SURE
884102673980633090 2017-07-09 17:31:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @ArtfulTweets And that's exactly what we intend to do.Trumpers and all other haters r going back under their rocks.They're vile & they're contaminating US
884101801682841601 2017-07-09 17:27:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @HuffPostPol @cre8ivetype Thanks to all who actively resist! We must persevere.
884099703423606785 2017-07-09 17:19:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @rhonda0859 @roywlewis @durbeyville Can't stand her "robot Barbie" but I think she looks way better post surgery.
884099268256071680 2017-07-09 17:17:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @rhonda0859 @roywlewis @PJKnouse God only knows! Certainly not mom and dad.
884099095622766592 2017-07-09 17:17:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @roywlewis @rhonda0859 Positive note: I don't think he's made much effort to influence Barron and he'll be dead before Barron can work for him.
884098500794998784 2017-07-09 17:14:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @rhonda0859 @roywlewis Exactly why she's his favorite. Well, that and she has a p***y to grab.
884097981531684864 2017-07-09 17:12:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul No it's a Constitutional Crisis. Please start calling it what it is and stop trying to "help" them do better. They DON't want to do better.
884096663673065476 2017-07-09 17:07:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenWarren @fee_teresa @ComentarioDicho @joejohnson043 Probs for using a non-trumpster word "obfuscate".But who's doing that? Maybe every Con RT Trumprussia scandal. (Where you learned the word)
884096017980952577 2017-07-09 17:04:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenWarren @fee_teresa @joejohnson043 What Faux News source wound you like for us to look it up on? Maybe Puti could look that up for you? Facts are facts-like it or not.
884095669673373696 2017-07-09 17:03:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenWarren Behold the Resistance. Or "Freedom Fighters" if you prefer.
884085446179000320 2017-07-09 16:22:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA They love that "nothin burger" line don't they. We'll be servin it up with some prison pie pretty soon.
884084791133577219 2017-07-09 16:20:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder I'd honestly go with Putin's word over trump's and I know how bad Putin is.
884084515278336001 2017-07-09 16:19:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton Yes and that shouldn't be a partisan position but alas it is. We have McConnell to thank for all of this division. He's a sucky Leader.
884069336083771393 2017-07-09 15:18:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Unfortunately, we know you are right.
884067308234211328 2017-07-09 15:10:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @marcorubio The Constitution separates Church/State for a reason. Please show some respect for it Senator.
884066689838706688 2017-07-09 15:08:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @BetsyOShea @marcorubio Marco, talk is cheap. Either do something or be quiet. The majority of Americans don't trust you or your empty words. Put up, or shut up.
884065332599697409 2017-07-09 15:02:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @OgreUasshole @ElinaBeauchamp @tribelaw @Ranazzi I don't have angst about BHO or the job he did. I do have angst about a traitor who colluded with Russia to steal the presidency. #RESIST.
884064891639934977 2017-07-09 15:01:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @OgreUasshole @ElinaBeauchamp @tribelaw @Ranazzi Can you honestly say you've been pleased with trump's performance to date? Look at what he's done to our reputation in the world.
884064331528327168 2017-07-09 14:58:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @OgreUasshole @ElinaBeauchamp @tribelaw @Ranazzi In 8 years, not everything has been perfect. In 6 months, things have.Even a total disaster.Just ask the ethics guy who just quit in disgust
884063738415992832 2017-07-09 14:56:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @OgreUasshole @ElinaBeauchamp @tribelaw @Ranazzi On a positive note. Today is trump's 51st day at a trump owned property. Orange you proud?
884062835046797314 2017-07-09 14:52:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @OgreUasshole @ElinaBeauchamp @tribelaw @Ranazzi Yes, when all else fails, by all means, blame the black dude. It's all his fault no matter what. Aren't you going to say that BHO "caused"?
884062108069105664 2017-07-09 14:50:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @Sailingflyingd Yea this was his "master plan". How gullible are you. And I'm sure "Larry" has read plenty.
884061404734644225 2017-07-09 14:47:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Dr_G_Enigma @tribelaw @jakibros1 Hey that's "the winter White House"and you know it.
884061203261161472 2017-07-09 14:46:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @ryrysven @tribelaw And maybe we could form a committee with the Rs to discourage gerrymandering and "better" healthcare program.
884060597620359169 2017-07-09 14:44:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @InlawsOutlaws @PreetBharara Lol, you have a funny side !

884059721292021762 2017-07-09 14:40:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix Sure. Sick.
884058931336798208 2017-07-09 14:37:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @CarlSpoerer2018 I'm sure there were more.
884057998112563200 2017-07-09 14:33:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @HuffPostPol @PrincessBravato @greggo34 Which was one of intended effects.
884055089966612480 2017-07-09 14:22:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyPillowUSA @RedRobin62 Along with many other crooks. You can sure pick them!
884054946907381760 2017-07-09 14:21:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyPillowUSA @CherylJstwin Very "patriotic" and he wears a cross too! Too bad BBB gave them an F rating.
884054549601947648 2017-07-09 14:20:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyPillowUSA @coultlee Does Fox Faux News pay you to say that?
884054412775354368 2017-07-09 14:19:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @MyPillowUSA @JeannaEckert Deplorable is right.

884046619280384000 2017-07-09 13:48:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @lilomeRita Was that before or after he complicated his Alt Right Speech?
884046300316135425 2017-07-09 13:47:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Just like Russia.
884040393448452096 2017-07-09 13:23:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @teenytinyflame @JuddLegum Gee I wonder why. Did he offer to let them stay in trump facility while they burned more fossil fuels?
884038988637581312 2017-07-09 13:18:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @Helenhs @ImdaPrincesse Great News, get it done. They're Cons and eventually will actually be Cons.
884032862684622848 2017-07-09 12:53:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Well, let's just be honest. Trump was correct about Marco, he is "little".
884030439140331521 2017-07-09 12:44:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @marcorubio Oh you haven't heard? He did that too. Marco, please don't tweet, ACT.

884015910528454656 2017-07-09 11:46:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Why aren't you man enough to actually speak to Americans. Even Vlad did that. You're tragically terrible at presidenting trump.
884015535696072704 2017-07-09 11:45:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @JeffTutorials Proud of all of your Fake News appearances? Repulsive.

883809717306437632 2017-07-08 22:07:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @KremlinRussia_E Well to be fair, he's able to string more than Three words together. So it's easier for him!

883796997840482305 2017-07-08 21:16:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABC Mr. President, could you give Mueller a call and ask him to put his foot on the gas. This guy is not only a Traitor, he's a Lunatic.
883796559783219200 2017-07-08 21:14:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @ABC When I see him I'm reminded of his last public address.It was a message to stand up and resist. He knew we had to in order to save Democracy
883795593407205376 2017-07-08 21:11:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA I mean can the words Ethics, republican, and Lawyer, mutually coexist? I think NOT! #RESIST

883787228861825025 2017-07-08 20:37:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA It's the old republican in you that makes you say that. They are the new republicans. Perhaps you should reconsider your party affiliation.
883786148165935105 2017-07-08 20:33:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @BeSeriousUSA Sick pup.
883785651052851201 2017-07-08 20:31:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @Marmel I enjoyed your piece and I agree. The longer we obstruct their vicious agenda the better. They are very bad people.

883780621113413633 2017-07-08 20:11:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan Too bad we have no global presence, thanks to trump & gop. Tax cut to the rich so you can be richer. You're really Deplorable, she was right

883777262012817408 2017-07-08 19:58:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr I mean really, just bc you use the "Jr., doesn't mean you hVe to act like you're 10.
883767888506740736 2017-07-08 19:20:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @Kimmybear87 @MuslimIQ I must admit, it's pretty good.

883757121518653442 2017-07-08 18:38:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @RWPUSA @CalReason And a really shitty, dishonest creep of a leAder, McConnell. Putting party and money over people has corrupted to this point. They own it!!!
883756558022299649 2017-07-08 18:35:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @RWPUSA @CalReason No no no, they are Republican! This is what republicans are now. Too much religion, racism, sexism, cronyism & dishonesty has lead to this.
883755929140854784 2017-07-08 18:33:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Well Mr Painter, I have to disagree. Absolving them of being Republican is to absolve the Rs in Congress who are clearly complicit.

883748216239476736 2017-07-08 18:02:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @Sisterwriter @tcobb_lexloci No doubt in my mind. He's a Russian Mobster. I mean look at his buds, Manafort, Page, Sater, Rexon.
883747798017081345 2017-07-08 18:01:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind No not kindly at all. This makes the job of the Resistance a long term commitment. We will not let folks forget the truth.

883690731159924737 2017-07-08 14:14:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC No need for fancy terms. Anybody with a brain has turned on trump.
883688034281107456 2017-07-08 14:03:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP @rvponders At least here in KY it is!
883687358272598016 2017-07-08 14:00:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP @rvponders Racism is huge in all of this in my opinion. Many whites feel like they've been abused by "liberal" policies.
883687056718876672 2017-07-08 13:59:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP @rvponders This has not been my experience. GOP claim to be for "workers" now & many believe it. (Vilify other race/religion/gender) to solidify group
883681958445940736 2017-07-08 13:39:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr My God you're such a dolt. Sorry dolt jr.
883681009866338304 2017-07-08 13:35:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP That's totally true isn't it? It blows me away that they don't realize they're being screwed at the same time.
883680104001490944 2017-07-08 13:32:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow @kwajalinda @CountryFirst50 Yes. It's the best Con job going. The Rs sell " we're the worker party" and they totally support big business interests. Con artists!

883667412033441793 2017-07-08 12:41:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Trump_Regrets @Nwatters If you're just "starting to regret" voting for him you're a bit slow on the uptake. Better late than never?

883441653758996480 2017-07-07 21:44:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @AhmedBaba_ Disgusting that you deal with this daily. We have a very long way to go. The haters need to know that they are not welcome in America.

883310989009178624 2017-07-07 13:05:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen @cookiearchitect War and Oil of course-it's sick.

883310271674101760 2017-07-07 13:02:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen Yes Mr. Eisen we do. Does the press? Do the lilly-livered Republicans in Congress? We can not do this alone. But we are certainly trying.
883309035608576000 2017-07-07 12:57:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @FriendEden100 I don't trust one word that they say.

883150410965536773 2017-07-06 02:27:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidYankovich @SheOfTheMyst Me too. He's one of the worst. All doe eyed choir boy innocence. He's a total scam artist. A good Con.
883146342285152256 2017-07-06 02:11:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP @TopherSpiro @Charmdimshure That one, nobody can claim they didn't make their intentions clear. I'm surprised they're having problems getting it passed frankly.
883142435580334082 2017-07-06 01:55:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP @TopherSpiro Nice, why didn't he think of that over the 7 years the Cons voted to repeal that healthcare bill.
883133524802449410 2017-07-06 01:20:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @shannonrwatts @ananavarro @panekbill Sick mind.
883126682114297856 2017-07-06 00:53:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix @djrothkopf Wasn't really even news. I bet he'll be in Rachel tonight!
883126083452891137 2017-07-06 00:50:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow @RWPUSA More fall out from having a Traitor and his cohorts in the White House. "Ethics Official" is a joke in this administration.
883123056239104004 2017-07-06 00:38:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @bannerite Zero. Less than Zero.
883118775196946434 2017-07-06 00:21:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @teamkimlisa I could use a laugh.
883117232896831489 2017-07-06 00:15:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @CNN @real_donald_ You people are enemies of the state. You like Russian Mobsters, Fake News and Lying so much. Move to Moscow. It's UnAmerican. It has to stop
883116491553611776 2017-07-06 00:12:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Wtf man. Congress do your jobs. He's a Russian Mobster. He's a Traitor. Get him out of the White House.
883115739405852672 2017-07-06 00:09:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @teamkimlisa He'd get my vote. I'd like him to run with Franken. Schiff has the class/smarts. Franken has like ability and street smarts. And he's FUNNY.
883115145559498753 2017-07-06 00:07:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 It's traitorous behavior. No surprise there. I refuse to pretend or feign surprise any more. He's a f***ing TRAITOR. TREASON IS REALLY BAD!
883113728828428288 2017-07-06 00:01:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS It runs deep.
883113560859181056 2017-07-06 00:00:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS lol that's what I thought u meant but then thought maybe u meant Dems. I'm sure there are many "parties" involved. Major Conspiracy. Major.
883108799556538368 2017-07-06 23:41:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @ItizBiz Or Faux News.
883108432215191554 2017-07-06 23:40:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Party?
883106130024697856 2017-07-06 23:31:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @wilytone @JYSexton Sick.
883105992254377988 2017-07-06 23:30:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @CDelaperriere @thehill Ummmm yea, Big Time. It's so sick. The Cons are morally bankrupt.
883103472387796996 2017-07-06 23:20:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Makes sense I guess. Or he was just blowing smoke, trying to deflect from his bud Vlad. Nothing would surprise me. Cons like Russian Rubles.
883068183854415872 2017-07-06 21:00:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones I hate to say it...probably Mueller.
883064725197770756 2017-07-06 20:46:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @pastorlocke And yet you voted for trump? Whatever!
883055911148941312 2017-07-06 20:11:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @CitizenKayS Really of all the politicians to like. He's totally creepy!
883055398663720960 2017-07-06 20:09:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @shoreboy1961 @WienerDawgsRule Oh yes, I do too. I think they cheated in multiple ways to steal the presidency. Many in Congress are complicit.
883054554811596800 2017-07-06 20:06:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @vbrighthorses Will betray? Also I don't find it shocking in the least. It's completely in keeping with the crap they've pulled from day one (and before).
883051472816099328 2017-07-06 19:54:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul He has Rexon. What could go wrong?
883049488302174208 2017-07-06 19:46:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @ComputeBlu @impeach_d_trump @SillsChar @JCrongeyer Back to paper-for sure.
883049239584133120 2017-07-06 19:45:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @UWantMyVote_Why @impeach_d_trump Yep pretty much. That's why I hope he's around long enough to flip the House.
883048909316161536 2017-07-06 19:44:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @shoreboy1961 @gaytimesmag Awesome
883037649535160320 2017-07-06 18:59:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @shoreboy1961 @WienerDawgsRule Well I know you said 25 years ago. Blows my mind that anybody could/would vote for trump.
883031618440572928 2017-07-06 18:35:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @atrupar @SafetyPinDaily Sure just "opting out" they're the party of free choice
883030662680326145 2017-07-06 18:31:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @OhNoSheTwitnt @Leighbra She can probably use the drink.
883030600172679169 2017-07-06 18:31:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @OhNoSheTwitnt @Leighbra Thanks for this info.
883030450012397568 2017-07-06 18:30:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @FLOTUS @BDOH @trytostopJane @geokelley Lol, probably true.
883030148139950081 2017-07-06 18:29:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @GOP @A_Siegel I've heard folks speak highly of Kemp as well. Always a Dem here. Republicans have always seemed self-absorbed & selfish to me.
883029433866735616 2017-07-06 18:26:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @southjerseymel I do too. He does seem decent/honest but politically, I'd have many issues.
883028477011787776 2017-07-06 18:22:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheDemocrats @BraddJaffy @DebraFBloom @CarolVicic FYI: trump craps on your precious constitution daily.
883027943005597696 2017-07-06 18:20:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheDemocrats @BraddJaffy @DebraFBloom @CarolVicic Carol please stop watching Faux Fox News. That is the "Fake News".
883027653242048512 2017-07-06 18:19:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @BraddJaffy @TimTalmey Totally. I refuse to watch him.
883027353965907969 2017-07-06 18:18:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @BraddJaffy He seemed to be seething. He hasn't had to answer a real question in months.
883025409482395648 2017-07-06 18:10:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @Liee4Trump @follow2thetruth All that money spent to investigate. And for what? Nothing.
883024700322041856 2017-07-06 18:07:49 UTC <HenslerKate> Wow. Are you a big "Deliverance" fan too?
883024506197094400 2017-07-06 18:07:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @BettyBowers Ummm he's not the one (of many Cons) being investigated by the FBI. But you're clearly not interested in the truth.
883024185039171584 2017-07-06 18:05:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @donald_fitzhugh @BettyBowers Lol really they just might.
883019710740267008 2017-07-06 17:47:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @shoreboy1961 @WienerDawgsRule So just curious, which one did you fall for ? I mean vote for?
883018985763213312 2017-07-06 17:45:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @OhNoSheTwitnt Who is that woman? I'd like to buy her a drink.
883018839843364864 2017-07-06 17:44:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @OhNoSheTwitnt The look on his face, PRICELESS.
883016823654023168 2017-07-06 17:36:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk Well really, who can blame him. They've been crapping on anything "ethical" including him since day one.
883016239815282688 2017-07-06 17:34:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 @soonermaterial This essential truth has always made me very skeptical about organized religion. Many bad things have been done in the name of Christ. TRUMP
883015881776930823 2017-07-06 17:32:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 @soonermaterial From Southern Babtist to Jehovah's Witness to born again Evangelicals-trust me, they all believe they are "right"
883015533985136640 2017-07-06 17:31:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 @soonermaterial I'd call that blind faith. Every sect of Christianity believes they have a lock on "truth". They can't all be "right".
883014285718425601 2017-07-06 17:26:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @TheRikoTun Can't wait to see all of the feigned surprise & disgust when treason and $$ laundering is "revealed" to the Cons.
883013953428881410 2017-07-06 17:25:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @TheRikoTun Except it should be shown totally off the tracks with the Cons running for their political lives. Good luck with that.
883013524682928128 2017-07-06 17:23:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason Actually,trump will end up being best thing to happen to Dems in awhile.Nothing like a little treason to help get your priorities in check,
883010884813062144 2017-07-06 17:12:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 @soonermaterial Your beliefs are very convenient in my mind.Ask and ye shall be forgiven. Priest  once said in HS that Only Catholics go to Heaven. Gospel.
883010341868851200 2017-07-06 17:10:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 @soonermaterial Science.
883005874524049408 2017-07-06 16:53:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 @soonermaterial If Christ, surely he embraces those who attempt to live in his honor. Isn't that what "Christian" means. No honest attempt=No Salvation.
883000690767015936 2017-07-06 16:32:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 @soonermaterial I'm not Christian or religious at all so that's pretty much a none issue. I loosely believe in a force of Good.But reject organized religion
882998320389664768 2017-07-06 16:22:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 @soonermaterial Do appreciate your response and your right to your beliefs-truly.
882998212101103617 2017-07-06 16:22:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 @soonermaterial Do you think trump is on Christ's side. I don't think a real Christ would take a "side" at all. Trump is so far from "Christian".
882997052287877121 2017-07-06 16:17:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @DashiellHammlet Goin with his gut!
882996773119283200 2017-07-06 16:16:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @adjustafresh @susie4equality Or Prince
882996508832014337 2017-07-06 16:15:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @trytostopJane @20committee Hope he lives long enough to rat on the rest of the Russian Mibsters who have infiltrated our White House.
882995176813232128 2017-07-06 16:10:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxineWaters So true Congresswoman Waters, so very true.
882993698929246208 2017-07-06 16:04:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @CarlSpoerer2018 @ProudResister Could be 18, "nobody knows".
882993083050332161 2017-07-06 16:02:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @UWantMyVote_Why @BraddJaffy Lol, it's the little victories that keep me going. Can't wait for the big one though!
882992677960200194 2017-07-06 16:00:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @imillhiser My God really. Let's put #Dolt45 in one!!!
882992390243586048 2017-07-06 15:59:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @KateCello @KamalaHarris We are Senator, we are.
882992184991129600 2017-07-06 15:58:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind @coffeesnotenuf Daily Caller?
882991885320675333 2017-07-06 15:57:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind Just the same shit he always gets away with.Guess what, he'll have another knee slapper b4 MSM has formulated a response. Democracy is dying
882991168602157056 2017-07-06 15:54:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @miranda3d918 I'm also sick of rational people hoping/suggesting that somehow he'll wise up, pivot, fly right. He's an Old Russian Mobster. Done-no hope.
882990554212073473 2017-07-06 15:52:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @miranda3d918 Agreed. Scary as hell. So many oblivious. Truth can not come fast enough.Longer it goes = more damage to our Democracy. Hope not irreparable
882986593824497665 2017-07-06 15:36:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @soonermaterial @miranda3d918 That's always been my thinking. Religions do it constantly. A real God would never really do that. Goes against everything else they preach.
882985827856470017 2017-07-06 15:33:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @miranda3d918 No way he will. He's not even smart enough to know he should-for optics sake!
882985153320153088 2017-07-06 15:30:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @DonaldJTrumpJr So dumb jr!
882984036448301056 2017-07-06 15:26:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @soonermaterial @miranda3d918 Sounds like it's working for you.
882983837017534465 2017-07-06 15:25:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @soonermaterial @miranda3d918 Kentucky. Land of McConnell and Paul. Really gross Governor too. Hard to take sometimes 
882982467275239427 2017-07-06 15:19:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @miranda3d918 @soonermaterial Your God approves of trump?
882982267798380545 2017-07-06 15:19:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @miranda3d918 @soonermaterial No response for my question?
882977267260981248 2017-07-06 14:59:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @soonermaterial @miranda3d918 No certainly not in my mind but I'm pretty cynical about organized religion. He's so far from Christian or conservative, it's a bad joke!
882976328148025350 2017-07-06 14:55:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @soonermaterial @miranda3d918 We immediately assume they're not to be trusted 
882976199504482304 2017-07-06 14:55:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @soonermaterial @miranda3d918 Prosperity movement. Local merchants do commercials wearing their big visible crosses as a beacon to others. Has opposite effect on us!
882975773015105537 2017-07-06 14:53:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @soonermaterial @miranda3d918 Yea we have a six flags over Jesus here! Totally property movement. Gross.
882975338216796161 2017-07-06 14:51:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @MrFrankBaraan Same for me. But I do begrudge people using their "faith" to act selfishly and disregard others.  No expert but that is NOT CHRIST LIKE.
882974417000816640 2017-07-06 14:48:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @ford_rev To be fair, I vote party too. It's just the better party. More accepting and inclusive. Not perfect, but def better than the Cons.
882973645458616321 2017-07-06 14:44:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Me too Sarah, but I have my doubts. McFaul knows his stuff but some are slower than others to fully accept the cold cruel truth. DENIAL.
882972846670180352 2017-07-06 14:41:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @Amy_Siskind Nothing new here
882971959419600897 2017-07-06 14:38:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckGrassley @ezlusztig @NefertitiVerita I don't know about his history but he's awful now-for sure!
882966023711936512 2017-07-06 14:14:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrickFreee @counterchekist @SarahsMimi Me too. Right now. That SOB HAS GOT TO GO!
882964323513114624 2017-07-06 14:07:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @soonermaterial @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 Their Christ somehow rewards them bc they do religion "right" & "white". It's pretty hateful stuff in the name of God (I think)
882963806745489408 2017-07-06 14:05:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedcruz @cait_harding @Voix_Of_Reason @soonermaterial @mindofamisfit1 @timetowakeup00 I believe "Evangelical" movement has done a fine job of deluding their followers into believing that Christ is on their side (not other's).
882962600996347904 2017-07-06 14:01:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @southjerseymel He's a bloody Libertarian. Rethink that please. He can be decent-don't trust his politics. He just knows how to be PC.
882962283672072193 2017-07-06 13:59:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig I'm not so sure of that. Seems very similar to me, they've just quit being PC.
882961828942368769 2017-07-06 13:57:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @GOP @A_Siegel Such as??? I'm at a loss on that one.
882961617977298945 2017-07-06 13:57:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckGrassley @ezlusztig @NefertitiVerita Wow he seems SO bad-welcome to the light!
882961193190785025 2017-07-06 13:55:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @goatburgler He really is a class A Hater!
882961050081034241 2017-07-06 13:54:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @LOLBeReasonable Oh man he always wreaked of dishonesty to me (I was older) I do remember kind of believing Ryan was a pretty good guy 
882960571779473409 2017-07-06 13:52:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @a4drey They have truly sold their soles to the devil. It would take a total rebuilding of that party.
882960091389063170 2017-07-06 13:51:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @ford_rev Romney fan?
882959929300189184 2017-07-06 13:50:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @annekbrooks That's probably true. They've really gotten a lot worse. Kasich is conservative and seemed quite moderate by comparison.
882959515808878592 2017-07-06 13:48:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @TxMagnoliaLink Oh God, Rick Perry? What was your thinking on that one?
882959121166860288 2017-07-06 13:47:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @Starbuck603 @GregCowboys Looks like a prince next to #Dolt45.

882957874778918912 2017-07-06 13:42:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @tcobb_lexloci Lol good one! I always thought Cons were selfish but this is SO MUCH WORSE than that.
882957395139416068 2017-07-06 13:40:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @ivesjar @ezlusztig Relative to other Cons, maybe.
882957234719924224 2017-07-06 13:39:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @ezlusztig That's called progress and enlightenment.
882945445470851072 2017-07-06 12:52:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @HillaryWarnedUs Me too. It's dark and depressing. They are haters. Haters of so much and of so many.
882942632586072064 2017-07-06 12:41:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 Bull shit Rexon. No deals with Russia.

882933281251053568 2017-07-06 12:04:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillOReilly You are a gross and simple minded old man.
882894814479609857 2017-07-06 09:31:41 UTC <HenslerKate> Trump is a treasonous traitor to the United States of America. #MAGA

882717644364947456 2017-07-05 21:47:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @trytostopJane @USMC_DD Sadly, I totally agree. I'm tired of folks trying to pretend there's any other really scenario. Can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
882716991559262208 2017-07-05 21:45:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @trytostopJane @ClintSmithIII He sure did-looks like a really cool guy. Happy for you!

882607511743942657 2017-07-05 14:30:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 It does seem to have increased dramatically lately though. (Even since he took office) I think it may be hastened by meds for "stress".
882607003201359872 2017-07-05 14:28:02 UTC <HenslerKate> Faux News running a segment right now about all of the errors CNN has been making. Bring it on CNN. We are Woke and we are ready!

882598014942150656 2017-07-05 13:52:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT Well Senator, they don't look people n the eye. They hide like little rats from their constituents.

882590788865191937 2017-07-05 13:23:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @metaquest They were so great. I always knew it but boy I really know it now and it makes me want to cry. Look how far we've fallen in just 6 months.

882579484855152641 2017-07-05 12:38:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @PassarelliAllan @JebSanford Boy this poll must include every last one of trump's supporters.

882307375348277248 2017-07-04 18:37:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @LindseyGrahamSC Do they know that you're getting ready to strip them of quality of care so that your rich backers get a fat tax cut? Just wondering.

882304078738489345 2017-07-04 18:24:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @kurteichenwald Probably spends a lot of time on his golden throne.

We can't continue to call ourselves "civilized" and behave in a third world way. Our Democracy is under seize.
882298218322829313 2017-07-04 18:01:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChelseaClinton @ironbigt Haters gonna hate. Trump has let them all crawl out from under their rocks. Sad how many claim to be Christian. Outliers in all faiths. SAD.
882293710331015168 2017-07-04 17:43:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @JoyAnnReid And they call us "snowflakes"?

881895840507449344 2017-07-03 15:22:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @DavidBWriter I like this. I'm going to do it too. I'll bet he hates it 
881892627632861184 2017-07-03 15:09:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @KaivanShroff Ummm way worse. He's the POTUS. So much worse.
881886642281357312 2017-07-03 14:45:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @PaladinCornelia I'm sure he knows nothing about it though 
881884864676548609 2017-07-03 14:38:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezlusztig @tbonier And then voting to pass it for him.
881884548908318720 2017-07-03 14:37:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @ezlusztig Not for one second, sadly.
881883760249253888 2017-07-03 14:34:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @AriBerman @vavrek_james @kylegriffin1 They are predictably despicable.
881867612585689091 2017-07-03 13:29:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @morten @102albers @rh2wild @RitaJ2011 @10cities10years @PaisleysTweets @thumper4066 Nice racist meme-supporting trump and speaking of BHO lack of character. Now that's a bad joke!
881867244493524992 2017-07-03 13:28:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @morten @102albers @rh2wild @RitaJ2011 @thumper4066 Wrong. Those are trump Faux News lies.
881865805922697217 2017-07-03 13:22:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @EdwardTHardy @chavezisasith He has colluded with Putin to steal an election though so there is that "success"! Hope you're proud of that one! It will take him down.
881843945587830784 2017-07-03 11:55:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Since the very first time I heard you I knew that you were completely right about this disaster.
881829734455406592 2017-07-03 10:59:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @PreetBharara He's so gross.
881828121900703744 2017-07-03 10:53:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @ohammersmith @ChristieLafran1 @anklebiter65 @wtime90 @superdefill You do realize we don't give a crap about what you have to say, right? I mean, you voted for the lying treasonous trump & STILL support him.
881732583515709444 2017-07-02 04:33:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @AndyMills_NJ @ChrisMegerian Gross.
881727824356409345 2017-07-02 04:14:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @StephenKing Precisely.
881630027502284804 2017-07-02 21:45:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @owillis @LOLGOP @Shareblue What's good for the goose is good for the gander. G.reed O.ver P.eople.
881592065225830400 2017-07-02 19:15:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedwoodGirl @ScienceMarchDC Tragically sad.
881591489125658628 2017-07-02 19:12:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs Yea, like something even bigger is about to drop. Has anybody checked Faux News to see what they're excusing today?
881587134532124674 2017-07-02 18:55:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Yes it's gross. It may be ok for Donald J Trump, but it is not ok for POTUS-ever. The Cons must stop pretending that it is, NOW.
881584216059899904 2017-07-02 18:43:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @DrMichelleK I'm not a doctor (nurse on paper) he looks like a good candidate for an MI. One can hope anyway.
881551331999322112 2017-07-02 16:33:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @DrMichelleK Oh Doctor, didn't u see Dr Bornstein's note? Fittest President ever! And yet, he was allowed to get away with it. He still is! #RESIST
881550399249010692 2017-07-02 16:29:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA @ohammersmith @ChristieLafran1 Omission? He was an accessory to treason for sure. He omitted the America First part!
881545288346988544 2017-07-02 16:09:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance Yea, she's a mean hater. Sorry I didn't see it sooner. She's right up there with Milo. Mensch is Murdoch's Wench. #UnfollowMensch
881533106909581312 2017-07-02 15:20:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio @zenmamaof3 @Indivisible_TPA lol Don't hold your breath!
881532404686573568 2017-07-02 15:17:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Yes Tea, shit's getting bad. REALLY BAD!
881524228901797888 2017-07-02 14:45:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bakari_Sellers @Discon1948 There's slow-learner and there's no-learner.
881523712733872128 2017-07-02 14:43:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @tribelaw So weird, I said this before dumb-dumb posted his wrestling gif. It just keeps getting worse.
881514554726940673 2017-07-02 14:07:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @tribelaw @dmmf7 I've seen women hold on for years with plenty of info.It's some bizarre animal instinct. "He's mine & you can't have him". Way past rational
881513476149170176 2017-07-02 14:02:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @tribelaw @dmmf7 Hope you're right. It's like a woman who's in an unhappy marriage, finds out he has a girlfriend. Then, she'll fight to the death for him.
881502123292340224 2017-07-02 13:17:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @tribelaw Yes, the sleazier he gets, the more they like him. Remember, This is the WWF crowd. There's no such thing as TOO low  for them.
881496904248565762 2017-07-02 12:56:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland @CBS @sarahkendzior @SteveBrant @nastiestwoman42 @DireMakerBand Omg, blame HRC and BHO. Not the idiots that voted for him. Sure, that makes sense.
881495499425054720 2017-07-02 12:51:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @angry_gram @sarahkendzior That's true.
881494068987088896 2017-07-02 12:45:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @Hillaryh4444Hos @therealezway He's nothing if not predictable.
881492818891599872 2017-07-02 12:40:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Not Dems! Please keep tweeting!!! Don't Ever Stop!
881492557154398208 2017-07-02 12:39:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Lol,you with evangelical friends. Now that's a joke.We've all seen your "friends" and there's not an ounce of religion in the combined lot.
881490579779203073 2017-07-02 12:31:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Lol, I was just there a week ago. Did you get them at the store with stuff only from the US?
881328901628338176 2017-07-01 01:49:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @megynkelly @NBCNews @nbc @bannerite @annabella313 Hmmm and get ratings aren't good? Go back to Fox already.

881323682441953285 2017-07-01 01:28:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @GailRNJD @AlisonForKY NO, I'd be afraid he'd send his goons.
881289119418200065 2017-07-01 23:11:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Looks yummy!
881274650092765188 2017-07-01 22:13:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump So much "winning"! Must be hard to take all that winning
881274278179635200 2017-07-01 22:12:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Brilliant! Nice to see you're spending your time wisely
881272306466770944 2017-07-01 22:04:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Absolutely not!!
881215216939302914 2017-07-01 18:17:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @KamalaHarris They only value dollars.
881171412983173120 2017-07-01 15:23:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @EqualityTexas @KidCasteel @Deb4CongressNM Texas is my least favorite state. "Don't  mess with Texas". Not a problem, it's redneck heaven.
881170517604126721 2017-07-01 15:19:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnKasich @Lawrence He's a decent guy. The only Republican candidate of any real substance. I wouldn't have  voted for him but so wish he had won.
881168790066798592 2017-07-01 15:13:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Mike_P_Williams @bilwil1963 Enjoy it while it lasts. Your "winning" moments are numbered.
881168467789008896 2017-07-01 15:11:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Mike_P_Williams Not "wannabe". Putin's Puppet trump is a mobster. I have to give him that.
881167553506271234 2017-07-01 15:08:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You Sir, you are "BAD PEOPLE".
881166862133981184 2017-07-01 15:05:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @CheriJacobus PERFECTION
881165401610231808 2017-07-01 14:59:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @Russian_Starr @DouthatNYT Yea, morning Joe was a big backer. He made so many excuses for trump. Mika always took Joe's crap. They are not nice men.
881163857347170304 2017-07-01 14:53:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @mindofamisfit1 @rbaker65708 "Checks in the mail"
881163369893507076 2017-07-01 14:51:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @jonfavs Yea, it's so painfully obvious he's gone off the deep end. I'm so tired of hearing "we knew what we were getting". He's deranged for sure.
881160171665412097 2017-07-01 14:38:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @TPM @joshtpm Sad. Just sad.
881159446835187712 2017-07-01 14:35:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @AlanDersh @tribelaw @NormEisen He's bought and payed for!
881158813398728708 2017-07-01 14:33:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @NormEisen Let me just say, I like Elitist Lawyers. They're smart and I find it refreshing. Guilty as charged!
881155930880176128 2017-07-01 14:21:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @peterdaou Hmmmm, Putin owns them.
881144920345636865 2017-07-01 13:38:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer Yes she did well in that interview. Maybe she's more seasoned now and would handle it a bit better! Hard to top McConnell and Paul
881144566174412800 2017-07-01 13:36:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @JustinTrudeau @realDonaldTrump @RKJ65 The whole world knows that!
881143498585591808 2017-07-01 13:32:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump "Very distinguished"
881143162160517121 2017-07-01 13:31:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @JustinTrudeau @realDonaldTrump Lol "friend"!!!
881142993289392128 2017-07-01 13:30:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @comcast @nbc @greta @realDonaldTrump No, she sucked.
881142637306183680 2017-07-01 13:29:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer Not a great candidate unfortunately.
881129555402084354 2017-07-01 12:37:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @SenSchumer And yet he won't and nothing will happen as a result.
881125752682491905 2017-07-01 12:22:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump lol so true!
881123064842465280 2017-07-01 12:11:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer She refused to say if she voted for Obama, which was really dumb. They used the sound bite to death.
881122816044789760 2017-07-01 12:10:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer She ran against Mealy Mouthed Mitch and lost 
881122489002323969 2017-07-01 12:09:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer @NewsManLou I have to agree. The party of passive is getting its you know what kicked. We need to stand up and be heard. They walk all over us.
881121293395001344 2017-07-01 12:04:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @dcherring Ummm hell yes!
881117419900723200 2017-07-01 11:48:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @JackKingston @demichieipgh @btfykes "Granny" I'll bet "grumpy" fits a lot better!
881117074717913088 2017-07-01 11:47:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @JackKingston @GOPennybakerIII Wish he had.
881112443044409344 2017-07-01 11:29:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid That tape is sick and my mother in law watches/listens to all of them. So much hating.
881022639409639424 2017-06-30 05:32:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Oh I can't believe it, they seem like such nice people.
881021388504649729 2017-06-30 05:27:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix He knew it all, he was writing the checks!

880803904132444160 2017-06-30 15:03:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Really, I wonder why 
880798052826611712 2017-06-30 14:39:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @tomtomorrow @knatalie2 @christyallison @pattyinNY @CapiMoon Well I'm shocked, "Bless his heart My Ass!
880797745824583680 2017-06-30 14:38:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @tomtomorrow @knatalie2 @christyallison @pattyinNY Yea, All in the name of Jesus, both white and orange.
880797031358484482 2017-06-30 14:35:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Wow, I remember when you supported him Joe. Mika told you what he was and yet you persisted. He's exactly who he was a year ago. Con Man.
880792064203661312 2017-06-30 14:16:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Oh boy, can you say DECOMPENSATE? It's a CODE RED for sure. He's going to FIRE AGAIN. Fire this crazy apprentice president already!
880790555197935616 2017-06-30 14:10:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @kamcpherson1 Yes she should. It will be a woman. The two Con females have stood out for having some decency and willingness to listen to their people.
880789845488087042 2017-06-30 14:07:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @TheBickell90 Yes there is. And somehow they've been convinced that we want to live off of welfare instead of work. That paying higher taxes is our goal.
880789281874300928 2017-06-30 14:05:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @kamcpherson1 Huge Threat.
880789096192495618 2017-06-30 14:04:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins @marconi_donna I'm going with "yes" for $500.
880788305943683073 2017-06-30 14:01:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorCollins Equal branch of power, hmmm, who knew? Use it already. He's a mobster. Get rid of him. He can not be effected by chastising him. Remove him.
880786333962305536 2017-06-30 13:53:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @watzgoinonhere @JuddLegum Wow, I watched some of Morning Joe-somehow missed this. I'd say shocking but then no, this is is how old mobsters behave, isn't it?
880784582362234880 2017-06-30 13:46:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @TeaPainUSA He got one from TIME!
880783862598684673 2017-06-30 13:43:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @serene19741 Lol
880783355557629953 2017-06-30 13:41:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @serene19741 SECRETLY?
880783102154506240 2017-06-30 13:40:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs Let's just be honest. It's a coup, bought and payed for by the 1%, both American and Russian. #RESIST.
880781752435974144 2017-06-30 13:35:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @JoeNBC @tribelaw @turbocheetoh trump is not only incompetent, he's also dangerous to our Democracy. Just as true for either party at this point. He puts us at risk daily.
880781115837075459 2017-06-30 13:32:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @JoeNBC @tribelaw @turbocheetoh Look at what he has done to our reputation/standing globally. Our allies no longer trust us, for good reason. The US, has fallen to a Despot
880780583202410497 2017-06-30 13:30:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @JoeNBC @tribelaw @turbocheetoh Calling me a mathematician does not make it so. trump is unworthy of the title, clearly.
880756950048419840 2017-06-30 11:56:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @morningmika @JoeNBC @tribelaw @turbocheetoh Lucky for us, Joe & Mika are not POTUS. Of course, POTUS is not POTUS, for that matter. The CONS elected a classless CON. WORST EVER!!!
880754431138168832 2017-06-30 11:46:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas They already are.
880752885163671552 2017-06-30 11:40:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @Aprile61446091 Don't forget DeVos, Pruitt, Carson, & Perry. All dumb haters against the department they head.
880752129492877313 2017-06-30 11:37:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Just Savin $$$ like he is at the state department 
880586087986581504 2017-06-29 00:37:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson I agree but that's so profoundly above trump's pay scale it's a waste to waste your breath. Like expecting a two year old to share.
880581842809782276 2017-06-29 00:20:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @NRA @Alyssa_Milano I don't approve of the availability of guns in this country. They're not keeping us safe,obviously. That's why they kill so many here, da!
880534386050965504 2017-06-29 21:12:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillKristol Lack there of.
880440178703302656 2017-06-29 14:57:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur Impropriety? What you talkin about?
880427202097098752 2017-06-29 14:06:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas That pretty much says it all now doesn't it?
880426958001242113 2017-06-29 14:05:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC @timetowakeup00 McConnell too!
880426759782576128 2017-06-29 14:04:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC He's a very troubled and desperate man. This nut job has the nuclear codes.
880425992984162307 2017-06-29 14:01:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @_NotFakeNews_ I can't. BHO wouldn't have said something like this in a million years.
880425814180995074 2017-06-29 14:00:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @PaulRizzo504 @thehill Just another segment in today's "How low can you go?"
880425520835567617 2017-06-29 13:59:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @RedTRaccoon This guy, Nealy Mouthed McConnell, doesn't believe in town halls. What in the hell do you think he is, Senate Majority Leader?
880421723048484864 2017-06-29 13:44:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You are so profoundly low.
880394930388074496 2017-06-29 11:58:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw I'm going with AllOfIt for 500$.
880377994698780673 2017-06-29 10:50:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @olgaNYC1211 And some would be accurate! SAD.
880376565258997760 2017-06-29 10:45:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @olgaNYC1211 Pretty sure we know guess what ole Lindsey's dirt must be. So Wrong. Where in the world will this end?
880375060011376640 2017-06-29 10:39:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @RKJ65 Evil and Stupid! Guess she's just following orders. Sure hope president bannon is happy.
880283532425297925 2017-06-28 04:35:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @politico @antipandemonium @kellydraper Yea, he's just as bad as the rest of the Cons.
880281000433025024 2017-06-28 04:25:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @nikkihaley @gwiss @jhinton_ WEAK, VERY WEAK.
880280239749967872 2017-06-28 04:22:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @nikkihaley Why is that a good thing? We have a nut job for POTUS. Keeping peace is our only hope for the future.

880050364178976768 2017-06-28 13:08:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @gailmarieheath @impeach_d_trump So dumb! Then they support #45 taking vacations to his own club with our money! Gross.
880048097124077569 2017-06-28 12:59:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump It seems that even your bots don't like you any more-SAD.
880039600806391809 2017-06-28 12:26:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrianKarem @CNN @ananavarro @ggoldator Oh god barf!!!
880039503381004289 2017-06-28 12:25:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrianKarem @CNN @Mynnoe @ananavarro Yes, he's old school and it's refreshing.
879850474618355712 2017-06-27 23:54:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @ProPublica Wow, nothing there. He's really not a good Christian.

879846563484401665 2017-06-27 23:39:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @Evan_McMullin @BroderWriter @counterchekist Evan is a good guy it seems but he'd be opposed to much of what Pres Schiff would try to implement.
879845833453309952 2017-06-27 23:36:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @Evan_McMullin @counterchekist Ummm no thanks. Evan seems to be a good honest guy. He's also a Libertarian and wants to reduce govt significantly. Rep Schiff is a Dem.
879813795345989632 2017-06-27 21:28:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @robreiner They all reserve that for Church on Sunday.
879686919751446528 2017-06-27 13:04:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Yea, that ship has sailed. Now it's just a question of how everybody else responds. The final outcome, depends on acceptance of that fact.
879678956684947456 2017-06-27 12:33:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN So much for "Bro-Mance". Just look at #44's facial expression-tragic he has to watch trump trash something he worked 8 years to create.
879677327785025536 2017-06-27 12:26:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @PattyArquette Well to be completely fair, #45 doesn't.
879670519146131456 2017-06-27 11:59:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You know times are really bad when POTUS re tweeting Hannity for heavens sake.

879451386383130626 2017-06-26 21:28:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @dailytonic @PassarelliAllan @MaddieBarry8 That's before he became a total sellout-DEPLORABLE.
879450968605196288 2017-06-26 21:27:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @nycsouthpaw Yea right, probably meeting with the Koch Brothers to have a celebration.
879446523783905280 2017-06-26 21:09:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @Acosta @brianstelter @PassarelliAllan @NicDawes Not Perhaps!

879445095753420801 2017-06-26 21:03:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @POTUS @heraldleader @KentuckyCoal @McConnellPress Hope and nothing else. Has he informed them that he's ready to strip them of coverage for the black lung disease that precious coal caused?
879444513466527745 2017-06-26 21:01:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Tax Cut to the Richest-which part if that is the least bit surprising? Talk about Deplorable.
879443954667835392 2017-06-26 20:59:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Wow a New Low and that's saying a hell of a lot!
879442259950927878 2017-06-26 20:52:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @TheLeadCNN Oh boy vast improvement 
879441893112901632 2017-06-26 20:51:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @Acosta Talk is cheap-ACT.
879262531797360640 2017-06-26 08:58:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @irinapromo @TopherSpiro So wish I could be there-with you in spirit!
879261745537220608 2017-06-26 08:55:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @RBReich Yes, that's exactly what it is.
879260005496705024 2017-06-26 08:48:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @AynRandPaulRyan Help he's our Senator,  He's the Connsumate Conman.

879200329937584128 2017-06-25 04:51:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @rieth_damon @impeach_d_trump Lol, good one!
879199564078645248 2017-06-25 04:48:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @mshannonmc Better get used to it, only gets worse (in your eyes) from here.
879196554372034561 2017-06-25 04:36:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Every "Journo" in there should record it on their phones.  This would also help to out the "Faux Journos".
879178695344357377 2017-06-25 03:25:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNBC She defines the word "BITCH".  The reason I always call her "Kellyanne C**tway".

879038197132611584 2017-06-25 18:06:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @DisavowTrump16 The idiots should have elected him. I don't care for his politics but he's at least honest and decent.
879027968772911104 2017-06-25 17:26:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff Honestly, I think Pence would be worse. Better to wait until we flip the house bc monopoly in house/senate with competent POTUS even worse.
879026116161351681 2017-06-25 17:18:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff Representative Schiff, I'm glad you're stepping up to lead. We Progressives need your leadership and direction. #2020.
879012268108910592 2017-06-25 16:23:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Bye bye Jason in the Big House!

878895023013728256 2017-06-25 08:37:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @suevisa @ChrisMurphyCT Once Again, Thank you Senator Murphy for your frank honesty. We need more of this from all Dem politicians.
878867875183955973 2017-06-24 06:50:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @MelissaJPeltier @SethN12 I think he's confused about "hiring" and "deposing".
878726402702442498 2017-06-24 21:27:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @watzgoinonhere @RiskyLiberal Wouldn't be the least bit surprised-is it time to cut him off?
878720393573519360 2017-06-24 21:04:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @VABVOX Well, that's entirely different. He deserved it. 
878720107110961152 2017-06-24 21:02:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @Egil_Skallagrim Ummm no, that's just dumb.

878718324951175168 2017-06-24 20:55:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @adamcbest @GoblinPolitical Really, that's so insightful.

878499311188881409 2017-06-23 06:25:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @KamalaHarris @LorenaDigital I agree. This Coup has proven (at least to me) that women are inherently more ethical and can be strong leaders.
878498554616172544 2017-06-23 06:22:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @citizensjd @KamalaHarris @chacolady I'll see you with Rand Paul and raise you to a f***ing Mitch McConnell.
878496732195246080 2017-06-23 06:15:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @KamalaHarris Keep them coming Senator Harris. Progressives have needed a leader. Happy to see you stepping up. Please don't stop.
878474287795113984 2017-06-23 04:46:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @SallyQYates Wow not sure if you're aware Sally, but the # of likes you've received is off the charts. 2020???
878473839545548800 2017-06-23 04:44:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA So True, Can't make this shit up :(
878472805460914176 2017-06-23 04:40:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix @Federalist_10 Their desire to use the resulting power nullifies everything else. Of course said power comes with a hell of a lot of $$$.
878372710535106561 2017-06-23 22:02:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @GlzgowlassLaing @Mikel_Jollett It's Bloody RT. Maybe we should call it RAT? RUSSIAN AMERICAN TELEVISION.
878371977437749248 2017-06-23 21:59:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @banke005 No,but Putin was.
878371368324255749 2017-06-23 21:57:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @impeach_d_trump Our cap driver in Paris today said he wanted to visit the US but said that he'd be waiting until after trump. SAD, BAD, WRONG.
878370660145405952 2017-06-23 21:54:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @pithypacky @JasonKander Jeffrey does not deserve to be on tv. He's worthless. I appreciate that you just said it, "it's a LIE".  More folks to to call it what it is
878357963559260160 2017-06-23 21:03:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @mikefarb1 @carmelmanion @curemecfs Same wanted to believe she was right. Truth is pretty obvious, just needed to wake up to it!

878308444339654656 2017-06-23 17:47:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @timesifeelMEGA @RepSpeier @KangasMom1 I know but we have Tea Party nut job, Matt Bevin plus Senators McConnell and Paul-Barf!
878300677952417792 2017-06-23 17:16:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @CitizenKayS Sick literally and figuratively. And Sad too.
878298393029861376 2017-06-23 17:07:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @adamcbest He's weird and not much of an actor in my humble opinion.
878295482291937280 2017-06-23 16:55:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton Congratulations Congressman and felicitations to Liz. Such a handsome couple! Happy for you both!
878294951603326976 2017-06-23 16:53:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC Don the Con is king of Fake News. Pitiful excuse for a president.
878293833280139266 2017-06-23 16:49:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @timesifeelMEGA @RepSpeier @KangasMom1 Ok but least NC managed to elect a Dem for governor. But your Cons Are really bad. So ok you're in!
878187157453778944 2017-06-23 09:45:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisMurphyCT @turbocheetoh Then they're screwed, but not nearly as many as with AHCA. That's why I support Universal Coverage, like all other civilized nations have.
878103712740237314 2017-06-22 04:13:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @JasonKander @Britt_Frazier J. Miller is so completely GROSS.
877932205686661121 2017-06-22 16:52:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @TopherSpiro Wish I was close and could go-please give McConnell a finger for me.
877931980922339329 2017-06-22 16:51:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson @Discon1948 Lol, well even if he did have them he'd have to deny it because if they existed they'd just support what Comey said.
877924801444286464 2017-06-22 16:22:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @timesifeelMEGA @RepSpeier @KangasMom1 Oh man that might even be worse. Connecticut is nice too!
877924589342478336 2017-06-22 16:21:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @MattLaslo @turbocheetoh Yes it's hilarious that the Cons are plAnning much worse coverage for more $ so 1% gets richer. Totally hilarious. You're twisted.
877923910938963968 2017-06-22 16:19:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @ashleyfeinberg What do you suppose is going on with Dr. Carson? He's just not quite all there is he?
877920628606742528 2017-06-22 16:06:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @timesifeelMEGA @RepSpeier @KangasMom1 Me too. Can't take KY, land of McConnell and Paul any more.
877920627138506752 2017-06-22 16:06:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @timesifeelMEGA @RepSpeier @KangasMom1 Me too. Can't take KY, land of McConnell and Paul any more.
877919506374328320 2017-06-22 16:01:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas @turbocheetoh Turbo, you really post some crap.
877918435585310720 2017-06-22 15:57:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @thekoukoureport I hate that expression. Translation=just trying to hang on to more of my $-the hell with everything/everyone else.
877912618731745282 2017-06-22 15:34:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas @turbocheetoh Wrong. No expansion, just downward spiral ending in impeachment. He's a total crook.
877910318332162048 2017-06-22 15:25:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid No Doubt About It Joy!

877910318097211393 2017-06-22 15:25:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump YOU'RE SHAMEFUL.
877910273570611200 2017-06-22 15:24:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepSpeier I agree with what Sarah Kendzior said.
877794946895331329 2017-06-22 07:46:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @FriendEden100 @RepAdamSchiff That's more like it Rep. Schiff! No more Mr. Nice guy. We know you're a dignified man but, desperate times, call for desperate measures.
877777424720683008 2017-06-21 06:37:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @PersuasivePR @RBReich And he hasn't met with constituents in I don't know how many hours!
877774983287713792 2017-06-21 06:27:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur I mean, he sounds like a seventh grader who's stoned.

877770188703150080 2017-06-21 06:08:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Maybe Dear Leader should babble on for three hours about what a fabulous leader he is?

877519893691805696 2017-06-21 13:33:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @KellyannePolls And she wonders why people wouldn't be bothered if someone shot her!
877517293449867264 2017-06-21 13:23:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @docrocktex26 @MinivanPunk I totally agree. Dems have not done well with civility. Take the damn gloves off and say it loud and proud. Obviously, America is ready!

876721471653113856 2017-06-19 08:41:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @DoctorRobin Good advice. I lost faith when Milo connection and racist views were revealed. Just my observations.

876687932106702849 2017-06-18 06:27:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 Just goes to show that changing the outside doesn't do shit for the inside.
876684640534355968 2017-06-18 06:14:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen "Trump's America" is so wrong.

875484764635004928 2017-06-15 22:46:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @KateCello @JoyAnnReid That might be the one and only honest thing he's said since he was elected.
875264811633963008 2017-06-15 08:12:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @impeach_d_trump Oh they "get it" just fine they're just trying to find a way to weasel out.

874745376678572032 2017-06-13 21:48:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarchForTruth17 So completely ridiculous. The United States top law official has never bothered to get any information if Russian pirating of out election.

873868749283229696 2017-06-11 11:45:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @PassarelliAllan @ambercartriana That's how it is when daddy is a mobster.  Lie and deny is the way kids are raised.
873803097637826562 2017-06-11 07:24:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen And they'll lie like the lil payed monkeys that they are.

873795802233278464 2017-06-10 06:55:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @CitizenKayS Yet the Cons could care less in the poorest & most desperate southern states.
873677482343505920 2017-06-10 23:05:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @VP @davebing69 @Azretan @LizzyBB10 Lol see how long that lasts.
873676769655705600 2017-06-10 23:02:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @VP Bold faced lie from a So Called Christian. Shameful Pence, So Shameful.
873641856298516480 2017-06-10 20:43:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @resistancepie @MarkSZaidEsq Well of course he does. It's like a secret-not-so-secret society of Russian mobsters. White supremacists one and all. Gross. Exile to Russia

873107262943842305 2017-06-09 09:19:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @greggiroux So when you get totally screwed over, thanks the Cons.
872967388559495169 2017-06-08 00:03:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @Unpersuaded112 Totally down with that. Ted is such a dishonest snake. Let's all contribute to help Beto get his ass out!
872963953990750210 2017-06-08 23:50:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Total bull crap paul- you lie too-guilty like the rest!
872876312062566401 2017-06-08 18:01:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Alan has ulterior motives for sure.

872210533239451649 2017-06-06 21:56:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @employexpert Well, I'd say there were plenty before that actually but yea that one was huge. How people didn't see right through him I'll never know.

872206302948151296 2017-06-06 21:39:22 UTC <HenslerKate> #WeThePeople are getting out of this country but I'll be checking on things to make sure trump hasn't abdicated his position to Putin.
872205315759947777 2017-06-06 21:35:26 UTC <HenslerKate> For sure, Not At All.
872205172461649922 2017-06-06 21:34:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @vavrek_james @kurteichenwald What? He doesn't believe it quite that much bud 
872204863760850944 2017-06-06 21:33:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland I'd say more like meningitis, hope we pull through!
872203249809477632 2017-06-06 21:27:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @AllysiaFinley @DarrellIssa @WSJ He's got to go. He's so bad!!!

872200246004248576 2017-06-06 21:15:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @jahimes @cavsfanaholic @Jim03220219 @soccermom06 We all found use a good laugh. Trump and his treason has not been fun for anyone.
872200008279486464 2017-06-06 21:14:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @jahimes @cavsfanaholic @soccermom06 Great, you can have the idiot. He could careless about Ohio unless he wants to do another victory tour. You got played.
872199293100314624 2017-06-06 21:11:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @jahimes @wordportrait1 And himself.
872199100070080513 2017-06-06 21:10:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @PaladinCornelia @jahimes Yes he most certainly is dangerous. Turns out it doesn't take many smarts or talent to launder dirty Russian money-Who knew?
872187154792841217 2017-06-06 20:23:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @marcorubio @MelissaJPeltier I wouldn't say too far of a fall, he's been in the basement for awhile IMO.
872186521172021253 2017-06-06 20:20:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @Indivisible_KY3 @Giggy24 I call his Lou # they usually answer.

872184275285815302 2017-06-06 20:11:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytimes @theintercept @joshrogin I feel sorry for the young women. I doubt she understood the consequences fully.
872183524127801344 2017-06-06 20:08:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @pemalevy @LOLGOP @Sean_PaddyM Wouldn't assume that.
872183387674615809 2017-06-06 20:08:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP So sad that in this admin this doesn't even register as an issue they're so damn corrupt. Gas lighting continues.
872181713774010370 2017-06-06 20:01:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @AGSchneiderman Anybody in particular in mind
872180446783819777 2017-06-06 19:56:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @KaivanShroff Ummm SOS Clinton!!!
872179982843424768 2017-06-06 19:54:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @conspirator0 @sarahkendzior @SavoySummer Just like F***ing Putin!

872175290092597253 2017-06-06 19:36:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhitfordBradley @JasonKander I've just learned that's called "the Sadim Touch".
872174862449741825 2017-06-06 19:34:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhitfordBradley @JasonKander I'm sure it won't disappoint-Epic Fail, like everything else he touches.
872172763443851264 2017-06-06 19:26:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @DHbsnBlndChfr33 @bradcooney1 They just want to repeal-that's as far as their "plan" ever got.They don't give a shit who dies or suffers as a result. It's 1% that matters
872172257988272129 2017-06-06 19:24:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan Eat it paul-we don't believe a word that dribbles from your mouth. The only thing in a "death spiral" is you & the rest of the Cons.
872171455127191552 2017-06-06 19:20:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @brhodes @Tucsonspringman @greer765 @ItsKey_70sbaby @smile_of_decade I think he's def medicated
872169390384533504 2017-06-06 19:12:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @brhodes @greer765 That's exactly right. Cue the pics of trumpryan love-2018. Take him down David Yankovich.
872168977094594562 2017-06-06 19:11:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @UWantMyVote_Why @brhodes And who can blame him?
872163875684327426 2017-06-06 18:50:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @USATODAY @politicalxx @ryrysven I think she's behaved quite gallantly myself. Knowing what she knew it would have been extremely difficult to resist, but resist she did.
872150358759550979 2017-06-06 17:57:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @kaitlancollins "Now about those leaks, we're VERY concerned about those leaks"
872149471974617089 2017-06-06 17:53:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Shamed into this, obviously.
872149246027464705 2017-06-06 17:52:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @politico lol he's going to need them all and them done. Definitely the SCANDAL of the Century.
872141507905675264 2017-06-06 17:21:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs Donald J. Trump is going to have to nominate himself as FBI Director because He's the only one who can do things right-#MAGA
872130530816532481 2017-06-06 16:38:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @SybilT2 Maybe the Cons will lock him in the oval tonight without his phone until Friday, no way #45 knows how to tweet via laptop. 
872126312307208192 2017-06-06 16:21:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @ClimateShelters @TrueFactsStated @ACJJustice @_independentcy @NewsJunkie60 That "you don't know what you have until it's gone" thing. When it's Democracy you're talking about, it only took ALMOST GONE.
872125658243227649 2017-06-06 16:18:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated And he seems like he's going to CROAK any second so really wtf? I guess it's live by the $$$, die by the $$$.
872118821020151808 2017-06-06 15:51:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @DavidYankovich I donated-please dethrone that hypocrite!
872065487127052288 2017-06-06 12:19:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @gracepelusi1 No we don't. We're very aware that you've totally drunk the Kool-Aid. Facts and Reality don't mean shit to you trump worshippers. Truly Sad.
872064849588748290 2017-06-06 12:17:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC It's time you completely acknowledge that it is #Dolt 45 who makes his own ridiculous and reckless decisions. He Owns Them.
872061417603698688 2017-06-06 12:03:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @goatburgler @TrumpPrisonDate @wintertao Well he's certainly chosen a few of those in his day!
871948365612888065 2017-06-05 04:34:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @Jazzbo99 @Green_Footballs Revote-let's get rid of the idiot and all of the other Crooks while we're at it!!!
871894500293136385 2017-06-05 01:00:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance I'm going with all of it: Pee pee tape, lots of rubles, colluded to win election, many years of laundering Russian $$$.
871768453111320576 2017-06-05 16:39:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @ConservativeLA So this is how you speak to people on "your side"? Nice Guy, maybe you should switch sides, you seem a little out of place.
871766411231866881 2017-06-05 16:31:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @ConservativeLA Great advice from someone who voted for an Authoritarian Leader. You clearly have a firm grasp of our Democracy. Your words are meaningless.
871750754503184384 2017-06-05 15:29:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC Just another lie in a field of a whole bunch of other lies.
871748569849634816 2017-06-05 15:20:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC @cait_harding Probably a blessing.
871748385577086977 2017-06-05 15:19:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidCornDC Not Jevanka, they seem fully indoctrinated to me. Melania is clearly repulsed by him. Tiff-she's under the radar.
871747642128203776 2017-06-05 15:16:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @PoliticusJason @SafetyPinDaily Totally relate to that!
871735813154983936 2017-06-05 14:29:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @letahamilton383 I'll stop when it's truly over and I mean totally over. From the little guy to the big guy, OVER and OUT.
871734746950361089 2017-06-05 14:25:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @ezraklein He's the King of the Deplorable. Maybe it's worse because he's actually smart?!?!
871734384419799041 2017-06-05 14:24:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrettArends He certainly does.
871733529339711488 2017-06-05 14:20:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @AndreaChalupa Hmmmm isn't that interesting?
871733058264805376 2017-06-05 14:18:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA He's an International Embarrassment.
871731164280750082 2017-06-05 14:11:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 @bettyaberlin Lol, tweeting "travel ban" should be the original ban not the watered down version-total idiot stuff as usual.
871730732988858368 2017-06-05 14:09:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 He truly is his own worst enemy, thank God!
871730268981383169 2017-06-05 14:07:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @TheRickWilson @ConservativeLA Empty promise my ass. If we manage to flip the House, trump is toast.
871729510231756800 2017-06-05 14:04:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson Great, it can be Fox, Breitbart, and Info Wars & Rush against the world. Bring It On. Can't Wait. Let In the Light of Day, Please.
871728093517545473 2017-06-05 13:59:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Don't you ever get tired of lying?
871726873843306496 2017-06-05 13:54:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You're an Internstional Embarrassment. Thanks for NOTHING #Dolt45.
871726479045951488 2017-06-05 13:52:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @olgaNYC1211 @rrhoop Wisconsin needs to reach out to the rest of the US for help. Many of us would like to see Ryan dethroned.
871588594628079616 2017-06-04 04:44:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @JohnDingell International Embarrassment.
871588076212105216 2017-06-04 04:42:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence @whartonparent I'd be happy with 1st year for trump.
871571104854401024 2017-06-04 03:35:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence @whartonparent Not exactly great advertising, the trump connection that is. But I'm sure Fred paid for the degree. Was it 2 yrs at each school for trump?
871558831276519424 2017-06-04 02:46:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @Dalton642 @JasonKander She's a Queen Deplorable. She's a hater of the first water.
871557994953179136 2017-06-04 02:43:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @Lawrence @whartonparent Thanks again for info-you should know. Money well spent I'm sure. (It's pretty pricey isn't it?)
871553900305928192 2017-06-04 02:26:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @whartonparent Are you a real parent of Wharton student or with the University? Just wondering? Prob did hear that on Lawrence!

871384485430005760 2017-06-04 15:13:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @JordanUhl @justinhendrix @AndreaChalupa @Shoq I feel I know all three people from twitter (which is kind of weird) but to know them is to like them. Great job guys.
871381962782593024 2017-06-04 15:03:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @zenmamaof3 @ananavarro Lol, me too. Honestly, that's probably as good as it gets!
871381690379272192 2017-06-04 15:02:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @davidfrum Umm yes David, quite a few I'd say.
871377702443462657 2017-06-04 14:46:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton He's so gross. Head of the EPA, an empty suit would do a better job.
871376667624615936 2017-06-04 14:42:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @bannerite @tmwinsett Lol it kind of made me look too!
871372483357749248 2017-06-04 14:26:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @PaulRizzo504 @davidfrum Lol pretty much correct.
871372360334573568 2017-06-04 14:25:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance @BraddJaffy Isn't that nice. I saw a sign yesterday at #MarchForTruth. It said "Get off the fairway, and do things the fair way. Show your taxes.
871371602889494529 2017-06-04 14:22:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesPPierce @peterdaou Well that and the millions of $$$ the GOP takes to work against their own people.
871371308092805120 2017-06-04 14:21:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix Not in a million years.
871370737424236544 2017-06-04 14:19:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @cathryneoden All true Cathy. Scary stuff but none the less true.

867410121021894662 2017-05-24 16:01:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe Lol Maxine is hardly the only one who believes it's true. Guess who's not "alive" the Russian guys who helped MI6 agent compile the dossier
867407514555514880 2017-05-24 15:50:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe Somewhere you need to factor that into your "beliefs" because it's not going away.
867407286507106304 2017-05-24 15:49:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe Did the Clinton's do this too?pic.twitter.com/qFNLTcOGbS
867406435252154369 2017-05-24 15:46:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe Guess what the guy in Britain was, British.
867406091646365697 2017-05-24 15:45:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe You don't think blowing people away while worshipping their Christian God terriristic?
867405110627971072 2017-05-24 15:41:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe What about this guy?pic.twitter.com/30NXK4EWVQ
867404809762156544 2017-05-24 15:39:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe That's just not true!
867404516630687748 2017-05-24 15:38:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe How is she such an America hater?
867404337441644544 2017-05-24 15:38:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe By the way "in my mind" is kind of a give away. That's conspiracy crazy crap!
867404052463853571 2017-05-24 15:36:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe You honestly believe Clinton has murdered someone? Why wouldn't she prosecuted if so? So much time on emails & Benghazi but 0 on that?
867402389862719488 2017-05-24 15:30:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanhannity @tessyto @lucywannabe No because she doesn't say crazy things fueled with hate and treat "guests" rudely. Also she's smart (which I appreciate) Sean is a drop out

867401118162276352 2017-05-24 15:25:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe Saying that a young pop singer should be assoc with ISIS is disturbed at best. It's mean and wrong.
867400814322647043 2017-05-24 15:24:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe Seth Rich story "truth" that's deluded Patty.
867400599385624576 2017-05-24 15:23:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanhannity @tessyto @lucywannabe For me it's not even really his message that I find so offensive, it's literally the nasty hatred that he spews. Plenty of Cons don't hate.
867400020454244357 2017-05-24 15:20:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @FemalesForTrump Apparently, not classy females for trump.
867399765595697152 2017-05-24 15:19:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @lucywannabe God that's really sick Patty.
867399176639971328 2017-05-24 15:17:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanhannity @tessyto @lucywannabe Gross, he's such a nasty SOB. What could you possibly like about him?

867398242832723968 2017-05-24 15:13:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanhannity @tessyto Wow Tessy, that's a really sad statement. What appeals to you most, all of his Lies or all of his Hate?
867393708911714304 2017-05-24 14:55:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanhannity @LawyersTrump I'd like to believe that a lawyer (even one for trump) recognizes the appropriate use of "you're" and "your".
867393208833200128 2017-05-24 14:53:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @seanhannity @corypaterson @missrubypugslee Lol Good One!
867392602773086208 2017-05-24 14:51:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanhannity Go screw yourself Sean, this is a grandma from KY, AKA The Resistance.
867392063222009856 2017-05-24 14:49:17 UTC <HenslerKate> I see it now. The clip of her talking about immigrants in Europe & pic with Milo pretty much said it all.
867391615685586944 2017-05-24 14:47:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT @BraddJaffy R-Texas-Pretty much says it all!

867340834609516544 2017-05-24 11:25:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance Totally Gross and Completely Unacceptable.
867340203035418624 2017-05-24 11:23:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @Morning_Joe @selectedwisdom Watching you now. I always enjoy your well informed but serious delivery. Thanks Clint.

867232249418309633 2017-05-23 04:14:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattmfm @ObiJuanKenobe @justhefax_mam Yea, you're not convincing Joe Friday.
867231207226052612 2017-05-23 04:10:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @mattmfm Very Encouraging, but not surprising. The Regressives are showing people who/what they really are and people don't like what they see.
867188944924004352 2017-05-23 01:22:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @RevDrBarber No kidding! Those guys are really evil, I'm convinced!
867188535505432580 2017-05-23 01:20:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson What you have to say about this makes total sense (unfortunately)also thanks for clearing up the Mench et al situation, that makes sense too

867166618325069825 2017-05-23 23:53:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @TrueFactsStated Hmmmm I wonder what it might be?
867166116333977601 2017-05-23 23:51:27 UTC <HenslerKate> Faux News and Hannity Strike Again. Yet, somehow his followers will find a way to believe Sean's bold faced lies.
867165164285702144 2017-05-23 23:47:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @mizmaimee Bring it on!!! Couldn't happen to a more deserving guy.

867126616111165440 2017-05-23 21:14:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA That certainly means a lot! Great Job

867101926089007108 2017-05-23 19:36:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @ItizBiz Lol, he has done an about face. He used to make up many excuses for trump. I still find him distasteful.
867101545359450112 2017-05-23 19:34:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @ananavarro He's a scum bag, for sure!
867101156505522177 2017-05-23 19:33:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 Yea, she seems to detest him.
867099729712361473 2017-05-23 19:27:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Didn't say he was pain in ass. He said he was so scattered he couldn't generate a cogent thought. In end, he just watched & put it to paper
867085577841258497 2017-05-23 18:31:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 Of course what he did was reprehensible. My objection was to choice of "evil loser" Bye bye.
867081914322210817 2017-05-23 18:16:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @CDCgov @ChelseaClinton @CultureStudy2 You're Nuts!

867081678212280323 2017-05-23 18:15:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @CDCgov @ChelseaClinton Such A Sad Statement that makes, along with all of the other horrible cuts. So that the Rich, will be richer :(
867061565308231680 2017-05-23 16:56:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Not the collusion issues.
867061332419465216 2017-05-23 16:55:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 I apprec U R willing to have civil exchange &part of me wishes I was wrong.His Russian money laundering will probably take him down (RICO)
867060624609734656 2017-05-23 16:52:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 He bought house in Florida for 50 M sold it to Russian Oligarch for 100 M. Two years later, the guy leveled the house, never even saw it. 
867060256068837378 2017-05-23 16:50:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 How successful? Four bankruptcies? Trump U? He started taking Russian dirty $ because US banks would no longer take risk of loaning him $.
867056427684294657 2017-05-23 16:35:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Which term is "unfair"?
867054962634878976 2017-05-23 16:29:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Well, I appreciate your honesty & sincerity. You were not alone. But this was Donny's biggest Con, ever, and he's had a lot of big ones.
867054019721797632 2017-05-23 16:26:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Have you ever heard the "writer" tell what it was like, trying to work with trump? It says a whole lot about trump. None of it good.
867052749006962688 2017-05-23 16:20:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Oh man, that's a sad statement. He didn't even write it. He's a Con Man who's been laundering dirty Russian $ for years. Sorry.
867051656172765184 2017-05-23 16:16:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 That's a WHOLE LOT of "Nothing".
867051444221956096 2017-05-23 16:15:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Just need to bide our time until we take back house, then the tides will turn. Why didn't Rs elect someone who was marginally competent?
867050934509211650 2017-05-23 16:13:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato @ezlusztig Well Both.
867050611942072320 2017-05-23 16:12:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Funny, I already like it. People are being shown the depth that Rs are willing to reach just to "service" the 1% & trump is without power.
867048926632923136 2017-05-23 16:05:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Yes we should have just trusted the House & Senate, both lead by Rs who did everything they could to impede progress- Good Thinking!
867047964891631618 2017-05-23 16:01:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @DianeKinyon Maybe both???
867039627529654272 2017-05-23 15:28:50 UTC <HenslerKate> Someone needs to check Gowdy's gene pool, something is NOT right there.

867033768045010946 2017-05-23 15:05:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Well they sure as hell wanted MANY investigations into Benghazi & emails now didn't they? Oh that different though, because that was a BIGLY
867032805544521731 2017-05-23 15:01:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Why do you suppose the GOP has been SO resistant to investigating? Hmmmm 
867031978436120577 2017-05-23 14:58:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 "foreign officials" who all happen to be Russian. Why did they all LIE about that contact? FLYNN, Kushner, Page, Manafort, Sessions ALL LIED
867031333020807168 2017-05-23 14:55:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Alan's off on this. Does he have security clearance? They did it,it's painfully obvious to anyone who's willing to open their eyes and see.
867030872956030976 2017-05-23 14:54:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @R_Wheeler4 Shame on me for standing up to trump. He's doing nothing but giving more $ to rich folks & taking from poor folks. Where do u fall in that?
867030143650471936 2017-05-23 14:51:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @NashCitySmitty @Republicants Yea he could barely put two words together. Pitiful. Guess that's why he was so "tired" and Javanka had to give his speech.
867029849218699264 2017-05-23 14:49:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Sessions, Flynn, Stone, Manafort, Kushner, Tillerson, Ross, Page, trump. All have dirty Russian connections. That's a damn BONFIRE. Sorry.
867029183175806976 2017-05-23 14:47:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 Collusion is not "fair and square" Enjoy your hate monger while he lasts, won't be too long.
867028880049266695 2017-05-23 14:46:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 I Am. An educated, motivated, competent adult .
867028329261563904 2017-05-23 14:43:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @MsMerricat White middle class lady here-Loved Obama! He was smart, measured and classy. Everything that trump is not. Trump's the worst Pres ever.
867027839232724993 2017-05-23 14:42:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @KentuckyWallC Way to make KY look even worse than the stereotype-Thanks!
867027663092887553 2017-05-23 14:41:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @Republicants @R_Wheeler4 #RESIST Obama did not collude with Russia to steal election. We will not stop until he's gone-got it?
867027248355868672 2017-05-23 14:39:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @NashCitySmitty @Republicants I thought the same thing.Saw a clip from campaign &although I did not like what he said,his delivery then was SO much better. "Nerve Pills?"
867026545038286849 2017-05-23 14:36:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @JHuber1988 Only if "common man" is an idiot.
867026174471548930 2017-05-23 14:35:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 @reallylibs Yea , because trump is all about unifying people. He Can't even give up his Hate Rallies.
867025900751261696 2017-05-23 14:34:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @activist360 Dude, you post crap from Faux News Hannity. "Evil Losers" is something a slow 7th grader would say. Broaden your horizons, watch real news.

865006425071693824 2017-05-17 00:49:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @adamcbest Sadly & Strangely very true. The Merkel thing was completely awful, such a total embarrassment .
865005719073857536 2017-05-17 00:46:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Did you enjoy seeing his thugs beat up protesters. I bet you were jealous.
865002889512501248 2017-05-17 00:35:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald I keep thinking, surely that's a joke, right?

864984666524332032 2017-05-17 23:23:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @PaladinCornelia We thought it was "charity"
864951776205824001 2017-05-17 21:12:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @PaulRizzo504 @BraddJaffy When President Bannon makes his choices for these positions, it unveils how profoundly warped he really is.

864875214471147521 2017-05-17 16:08:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @USARedOrchestra Crickets from trump, a fellow Authoritarian leader. He's just counting the days until he can unleash him goons on his protesters.

864587667236954112 2017-05-16 21:05:37 UTC <HenslerKate> Heard you try and say trump is a Democrat this morning. Don't you try and say that. We had a capable candidate & idiots like you voted trump
864584596251435010 2017-05-16 20:53:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @aacampos86 Non of it. I don't think he could manage one of his golf clubs-No Way.
864584194256769024 2017-05-16 20:51:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @missmelsays I see it as a blatant choice to ignore dumpster while they try to ram their crappy agenda down our throats.
864582497509789696 2017-05-16 20:45:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @SharonFalkowski We won't even hear everything, but it will certainly be completely mortifying.

864580057725108228 2017-05-16 20:35:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @letahamilton383 @jonfavs My mom used to say "you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Pretty much sums it up.
864525798665056256 2017-05-16 16:59:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @AynRandPaulRyan Go tell Milo, you nut!
864518887244746752 2017-05-16 16:32:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @tenax666 Maybe a judge, not sure lawyer or MP is so principled myself. Not media, sad how many professions go hand/hand with "flexible moral fiber".
864478987891998720 2017-05-16 13:53:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @tenax666 Wow. Well sleeping at night is critical or you end up crazy old trump. I'd like to think I'd make the same decision. Principles matter.
864467213536948224 2017-05-16 13:06:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @tenax666 Totally agree, McMaster fell on his sword for a traitor. Not Smart. I'd rather be Dishonorably Discharged then lie for trump.
864466208199933952 2017-05-16 13:02:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @tenax666 Chain of command is not a choice in the military. Basic Training 101.
864453975898284032 2017-05-16 12:14:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @tenax666 He's still active duty. I guess he's not ready to be done.He's 54. Must not be too bright,he trusted trump and most of us knew what he'd do.
864452908095549441 2017-05-16 12:10:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @tenax666 If I followed orders I didn't agree with, I would most certainly consider it a skill. Not one that I would be proud of, but a skill.
864450685441638400 2017-05-16 12:01:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @tenax666 A Good Soldier takes orders. You don't get to be a general without that skill.
864450190358589440 2017-05-16 11:59:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @tenax666 Me either, it's why I could never be in the military.

864348377340715008 2017-05-15 05:14:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @amv333 @peterdaou Yes. There is something seriously wrong with The Cons in Congress. "Checks & Balances" are gone.

864330746995109888 2017-05-15 04:04:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @AndreaChalupa Absolutely disgusting! We must do a better job of making sure that more people see this than saw trump for what he was.

864270998136389634 2017-05-15 00:07:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @suburbangrouse But unfortunately his defense of trump is highly questionable.
864270789729759236 2017-05-15 00:06:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @suburbangrouse Well technically I don't think he could refuse bc he was active duty.

863399270577315842 2017-05-13 14:23:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @monica_watson14 @jlendino @jenannie And If Soros would get his act together on the  $$$ to protesters, I might be rich enough for a spot in the WH.

863387982069456896 2017-05-13 13:38:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @zebrafinch @richardjoynes Totally agree, it's not a total shock but level of corruption and complicity is staggering to me. Can't wait to see Ryan & McConnell fall.
863387100699295746 2017-05-13 13:35:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @MightyMikeT @cherry_bethea Cherry I suspect you're both, full of the "isms" and simple minded. Glad you retired!
863386813431500800 2017-05-13 13:33:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul @MightyMikeT Exactly, anybody who supported him after that is either full of all the "isms" they're accused of or just simple minded. Clear to me, too!
863386014798282753 2017-05-13 13:30:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul I would expect your loyalty to be to country not friends willing to sell their souls to the devil (just saying).
863380110900162561 2017-05-13 13:07:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bakari_Sellers I sure don't agree with Rand on much, but he's certainly right about this.

863098698997391360 2017-05-12 18:29:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @PersuasivePR For sure, makes sense, Citizens United my A**
863098200558899201 2017-05-12 18:27:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @jlendino @philtheswo Well it looks like we are like minded but I have softened a bit on those who voted for him (although their blind loyalty is hard to take)
863083782143868928 2017-05-12 17:29:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder More like "family ties trump everything"
863083477104832512 2017-05-12 17:28:30 UTC <HenslerKate> Where's Rexon, guess he had some Russian xyn to suck, and sent McMaster in his place.
863078069384425473 2017-05-12 17:07:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Don't think you want to know the answer to that bud.
863074035260960768 2017-05-12 16:50:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes If he did (highly doubtful) it wouldn't say what he says it says! He's a path liar. Didn't love Comey but I do believe he's ethical

863065079528513537 2017-05-12 16:15:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @jlendino A little slow on the update (sleep deprived lately) and way too many salacious details to keep straight. Thank You :)
863064718508003329 2017-05-12 16:13:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @TDPattillo Not worth the Paper it's written on.

863060875003006977 2017-05-12 15:58:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @justmeinlv @AltWorldCitizen Totally agree. Consistent public shaming would get a lot of play at this point. Could orchestrate with social media pretty easily.

863059622139133952 2017-05-12 15:53:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @collectist @brianklaas In NYC, they call it "Mob Mentality".
863057910997364736 2017-05-12 15:46:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @justmeinlv @AltWorldCitizen Don't get me wrong, I'm all for "grab your wallet" approach but I think public shaming of Cons in Congress might be more effective/immediate
863056918214057984 2017-05-12 15:42:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @jlendino Wait I'm not getting this?
863056714047918083 2017-05-12 15:42:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes Maybe Comey "wore a wire" :)
863042050958209025 2017-05-12 14:43:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @justmeinlv @AltWorldCitizen Good thought, but their $$ comes from big business,who they protect with their lives. Mercer,DeVoss, Kock Bros, Wall St., et al, UNTOUCHABLE

863017570907160576 2017-05-12 13:06:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @TrueFactsStated Well, it is for the Super Bowl of the World. THIS IS NOT FANTASY FOOTBALL.
863016330441748480 2017-05-12 13:01:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RJSzczerba @tweettruth2me Yes, it's Chuck who's colluding with putin. Good one Russian Bot-they need to tweek these they're getting very weak as of late.
863015301587374081 2017-05-12 12:57:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RJSzczerba The day trump named rexon as SOS I knew for sure the TrumpRussia thing was completely real. (Full stop-as they like to say)
863014267427180544 2017-05-12 12:53:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Maybe u should issue an edict and outlaw all news except for Fox Fake News to disseminate your propaganda? That would clear up all CONFUSION
863012909269569538 2017-05-12 12:48:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @VP @GOP @LouiseMensch @kim @TerenceSexton2 Oh I'll bet he is!!!
863011114568863744 2017-05-12 12:40:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan Saw your disgusting infomercial about "keeping your promise"to people to screw them over by taking insurance from them-NICE GUY
863009363073667072 2017-05-12 12:34:00 UTC <HenslerKate> So, I guess the Kushners went skiing again? I haven't seen either one in quite sometime. Guess there's some cheap office space open in WH?
863007476794478592 2017-05-12 12:26:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Joe, the people you named this am, were not "made out" to be liars, they are, in their own right, LIARS.
863006072201728000 2017-05-12 12:20:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC The Cons are Znot stepping up because they are Dirty too. They can't! McConnell, Ryan, Burr, Nunes, Chaffetz All Used Dirty Rubles.
862990219859111936 2017-05-12 11:17:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @JRMcGrail @clearlighte @LardLad3545 Yes, I think so too, but it's still got to play out whether they're ready or not. Can't stop the treasonous trump train from derailing.
862989579254718464 2017-05-12 11:15:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @JRMcGrail Sure would make sense . Rudy is a crazy hater for sure. He's Dirty for Sure. He has the evil Flynn eyes.
862988258774573056 2017-05-12 11:10:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Recall months ago, you liking trump, going on about U of A Profs being Dems, that's bc we're smarter. Trump obvious from day one Joe.
862987502289899522 2017-05-12 11:07:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Good Lord, they cheated everyday of the week and twice on Sunday. He cheated with Russia to use hacked email info, Bots, Propoganda & Comey
862893220677787648 2017-05-11 04:52:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @RonWyden Lol, well it's not HRC who will go down in history as a traitor to her country. They'll lock up quite a few Cons, many crooks going down ;)
862787887003250689 2017-05-11 21:53:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump 911 the POTUS IS DECOMPENSATING before our very eyes. Stay Woke Folks, this is going to be UGLY.

862705378013982720 2017-05-11 16:26:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @JordanUhl It was So Awesome, SHAME.
862704917919793153 2017-05-11 16:24:15 UTC <HenslerKate> Is it just me or do you folks find Rep Rotten Cotton saying "the inmates are running the asylum" and chuckling, completely offensive?
862704251373539328 2017-05-11 16:21:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP Wait, you forgot to say it was the same Dem 
862703807603646464 2017-05-11 16:19:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @ddiamond I guess when you've been getting away with lying for years you just can't turn it off-SICK!
862703255289290752 2017-05-11 16:17:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP Well said.
862695770868330496 2017-05-11 15:47:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @RonWyden Well Patriotic Americans have certainly not forgotten. He screamed it, right after "Lock her up"!
862694792752508928 2017-05-11 15:44:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateDems @apfel_sarah Yes Shut it the F Down, NOW!
862693539427307520 2017-05-11 15:39:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @dumptrump33 Is it me or does Pence have Charles Manson eyes?

862691052871970818 2017-05-11 15:29:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedTRaccoon Gladly, this pic says it all. WTH America?
862688693206872065 2017-05-11 15:19:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @ASlavitt Wow, so disturbing but so moving. I'm sure MacArthur felt nothing. He had a lot of very rich people to appease. ;(
862686129795026944 2017-05-11 15:09:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @AltWorldCitizen @justmeinlv You obviously feel strongly but it kind of is. Just ask Pence, the "Freedom Caucus" all good Christians trying to screw the sick and poor.
862682395287465989 2017-05-11 14:54:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @PalmerReport @MikeInLasVegas Totally Agree Mike.

862678312858116096 2017-05-11 14:38:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @MelissaJPeltier Ryan is so completely Soulless. He literally gets off on stealing from the poor and giving it to the rich. He makes me sick.
862677474064441344 2017-05-11 14:35:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @AltWorldCitizen @justmeinlv That may not be how your Christianity works but it most certainly is how some people's Christianity works, Sadly.
862676572746153984 2017-05-11 14:31:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @justmeinlv @AltWorldCitizen No different from how some corrupt what the Koran says. If you use "God" to legitimize your actions, you can rationalize anything, Sadly.
862676113029566465 2017-05-11 14:29:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorBurr Rich, we the true Americans & Patriots don't trust you, not at all. You should be totally ashamed of yourself.?
862674966826897408 2017-05-11 14:25:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @AltWorldCitizen @justmeinlv Well I'm not Christian, they've always been hypocritical in my mind. "Religion is the opiate of the people" and I'm not into opiates.
862670693321908225 2017-05-11 14:08:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @selectedwisdom No Anything policy would be more accurate. Russia policy: Rosneft $$$.
862667901802860545 2017-05-11 13:57:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Good thought but he's the Artful Dodger, "well there's a whole lot to know and of course I do, because I'm like smart, but it's complicated"

861939266930311171 2017-05-09 13:41:49 UTC <HenslerKate> This just in, Comey"misspoke" about his reasons for his infamous letter? No Shit? He's right there with them. Is "mild nausea" deadly?
861938765882949632 2017-05-09 13:39:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated I don't know how we don't get a ReVote. I mean, colluding with Russia isn't a deal breaker, how can that be right?
861934355677151235 2017-05-09 13:22:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @docrocktex26 @JoshuaGuess Not even a little. And even some reasonable people speaking out about her speaking out? Ridiculous Double Standard.

861933038682427392 2017-05-09 13:17:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind I would never vote for Nikki Haley but at least she has some integrity. I couldn't believe when trump made the comment about firing her-sick

861802686139727872 2017-05-08 04:39:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @PalmerReport @ProletariatRage I disagree, Apathy?
861802036844793860 2017-05-08 04:36:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheCut @a35362 Positively everything related to trump is way smaller than he claims.

861666127151333376 2017-05-08 19:36:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @MarchForTruth17 And here's old man Grassley going on about "unmasking"and leaking it.No questions related to accepting Flynn's contacts with Russia & no vet
861664835892903936 2017-05-08 19:31:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou They proved awhile ago it's Greed Over People (GOP). Anything to deflect and obstruct. "It's about the unmasking and leak" NOT THE COLLUSION

861562500223033344 2017-05-08 12:44:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou For you perhaps, for others it's just using a familiar lexicon to help more fully and comfortably deliver a message to the masses.

861220790523527168 2017-05-07 14:06:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @grandmahannah Yes. Why do they let these people come on their shows and lie? I'm over it, I'm done being a sitting duck for their so-called objective news
861212152073523200 2017-05-07 13:32:32 UTC <HenslerKate> Obama fan, but the Cons have been calling the shots for awhile.Remember M. Garland? Obama wanted to go public about Russia,McConnell said NO

861209933492215808 2017-05-07 13:23:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN It's Price, the insider trading prick. What makes a lot of sense is getting rid of the many crooks like Price. Sick excuse for a doctor.
861208839747710976 2017-05-07 13:19:22 UTC <HenslerKate> I wouldn't be so sure of that. Their unchecked power has done nothing but fester and grow. NO Invisible line, that has already been crossed.

860700185088995329 2017-05-05 03:38:09 UTC <HenslerKate> Maybe we could tweet storm him with shame bc Australian healthcare is far superior and get him to "suggest" trump's universal healthcare.
860697725989527552 2017-05-05 03:28:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @starbuck13502 True. Also true, they used working folk's struggles to suck them into voting for trump and have been crapping on them ever since.

860182258543677441 2017-05-04 17:20:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @FrancesWills Because she has some integrity. Unlike evil Sessions, who totally lied to Congress and now spends his time hunting innocent "illegals".
860180920858537988 2017-05-04 17:14:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch Instead, they're hound dogging Susan Rice for doing her job. Any black woman will do for the Cons, it doesn't really matter who she is.
860180389129859073 2017-05-04 17:12:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch That's right, bc if it were actionable, the Cons would have 25 Ind Comm & Spec Pros working in it right now.
860178516544856065 2017-05-04 17:05:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @PragueloverR If you think they didn't know, you are quite naive.
860178226030792704 2017-05-04 17:04:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianefallon @turbocheetoh Sure, it's going to cost a lot more and cover a lot less. Good luck selling that one.
860176564184592384 2017-05-04 16:57:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @PragueloverR @Chare11 It's a thought, but I'm certain they knew anyway. That kind of info does not stay secret, just ask Rudy.
860175963090554880 2017-05-04 16:55:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @gizzandizz Tell that to J. Edgar Hoover.
860175769749901313 2017-05-04 16:54:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @gizzandizz One can hope, but I'm not at all hopeful about that.
860175446260027392 2017-05-04 16:53:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch Yes because at the end of the day, it's really alwAys the Clinton's fault.
860175177107296257 2017-05-04 16:51:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @John_G_MacA Ummm no, trump would not have been elected.
860174852656959488 2017-05-04 16:50:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @gizzandizz Then you should have told Rudy and the other FBI Crooks that if they leaked HRC/Weiner emails then he'd leak TrumpRussia investigation.
860173719825723392 2017-05-04 16:46:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @PragueloverR Bull, he "wasn't ready yet" on Weiner emails either but he did it. No Excuse.
860173445937627136 2017-05-04 16:45:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @PragueloverR So why wouldn't you reveal looking into the Kremlin Klan? Seems to me, that's slightly more imp than some stupid emails that Weiner had.
860172657333080064 2017-05-04 16:41:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @gizzandizz Guess what Comey is??? A multimillionaire who...ding,ding,ding...Was a hedge fund Exec. How much will the Cons "tax plan" save him?
860169818967875584 2017-05-04 16:30:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @gizzandizz "Golly gee willickers, this has been just awful for me (but I did get who I wanted in office) so I guess I'll accept the mild nausea". FU!
860168974876762112 2017-05-04 16:27:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @gizzandizz Well believe it, but I thought his performance yesterday was just that, a performance. Mildly nauseous is not a "normal" reaction to trump.
860168282363527170 2017-05-04 16:24:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch The odds of those "Weiner emails" being anything were so slim it's ridiculous. Just salacious crap.
860167621513285632 2017-05-04 16:21:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch Do he didn't know that Chaffetz would leak it in a NY minute (Because I certainly would have). Updated on nothing.
860166968866942976 2017-05-04 16:19:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch The second he said what he did 1. I knew it was total BS 2. I knew trump would win. That's just wrong.
860166656848482306 2017-05-04 16:18:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch At the very least, he should have come clean about the FBI investigation of TrumpRussia if he had to reveal one then why not they other?
860166179259908097 2017-05-04 16:16:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch Well thAts pretty messed up. "Concealment" would have been "catastrophic" No Comey. Trump is "catastrophic". It was a partisan decision.
860165313631006721 2017-05-04 16:12:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch I don't buy it. He acted as the Republican that he is, looking for justification for his actions.
860163627466227712 2017-05-04 16:06:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch Bull, that's pretty slanted. Clearly he sided with the Cons plain & simple. "Reveal or conceal" how about following FBI rules bud.
860161430854742016 2017-05-04 15:57:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @AriMelber @counterchekist @EllenMorris1222 @RogerJStoneJr @LouiseMensch Lol no surprise there.

860107856422600705 2017-05-04 12:24:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN And all the Cons care about is protecting Gun Rights, taking medical care from those gunshot victims, and killing "terrorists". Nice Group.

859784459696189440 2017-05-03 14:59:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CharlesMBlow @josephamodeo @TrumpFor2Terms Why do you say Islam and not terrorists? When you say that, it makes it seem like you think all muslims are evil, is that what you think?
859782615276154880 2017-05-03 14:52:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @JaneDoeTheFirst Yea it's total crap. But he didn't mention trump's treason with Russia-That's Catastrophic. Gee Golly, I wish Oz had given him a brain.
859781619640659968 2017-05-03 14:48:06 UTC <HenslerKate> Comey saying outcomes of his actions (getting trump in office) should not be considered-ridiculous. What is more important than that?
859780898996326400 2017-05-03 14:45:14 UTC <HenslerKate> Screw you Comey, "catastrophic" is trump not fucking emails. I would have concealed in a NY minute. For sure, you idiot.
859779450694762497 2017-05-03 14:39:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @GeorgeTakei @CJPatruno @Kdplayer13 Sorry Carlos, we already have. You might want to rethink that. Do you think the "truth marchers" did any thing for the Black cause?
859779016160673793 2017-05-03 14:37:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CharlesMBlow @josephamodeo @TrumpFor2Terms I don't "pander" to LGBTQ folks but I support their rights as people. I am a woman, so yes I support woman's rights, yes reproductive rights
859778576111071232 2017-05-03 14:36:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CharlesMBlow @josephamodeo @TrumpFor2Terms I certainly have no affinity for terrirists, no issues with muslims. Ivanka is fine but has NO place in the WH and neither does Jared!
859777678060249092 2017-05-03 14:32:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CharlesMBlow @josephamodeo @TrumpFor2Terms Lately though, she seems to be struggling to defend trump, it's not getting any easier to do that.
859777419774918656 2017-05-03 14:31:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CharlesMBlow @josephamodeo @TrumpFor2Terms I doubt she lost any sleep over it. She wears sexy clothes and a big huge cross, I find her offensive.
859776979133923329 2017-05-03 14:29:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CharlesMBlow @josephamodeo @TrumpFor2Terms Please, he didn't "treat" her so badly. She did try to warm him up by touching him and he called her out on it.  She's a Harvard lawyer.
859775225843548160 2017-05-03 14:22:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @UWantMyVote_Why @sammypolsen12 Oh man that's gonna really mess up the fake tan!!!

859773625200762880 2017-05-03 14:16:20 UTC <HenslerKate> Wtf is Grassley talking about, he's lost his marbles for sure :(.
859773062610399232 2017-05-03 14:14:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @GeorgeTakei @CJPatruno @Kdplayer13 Too many for you to handle, way too many Carlos.
859772236361846786 2017-05-03 14:10:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckGrassley You can't even read aloud any more, RESIGN! Oversight of FBI, yet you sit there and say there's nothing to the TrumpRussia scam.
859771738745430016 2017-05-03 14:08:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChuckGrassley You need to resign. We don't trust one word from your mouth. You and your party are totally corrupt. Trump et al committed TREASON.
859769934678827008 2017-05-03 14:01:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CharlesMBlow @josephamodeo @TrumpFor2Terms I don't think "masculinity" is a word that is of often used to describe Charles' actions. By the way, I'm a white woman.
859769381206839297 2017-05-03 13:59:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CharlesMBlow @josephamodeo @TrumpFor2Terms Sure.
859768520405643264 2017-05-03 13:56:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP They are SO hypocritical.They believe in "personal responsibility" just not as it relates to GUNS. Jesus, just not as this relates to people

859758548972183553 2017-05-03 13:16:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @PaulRizzo504 @GeorgeTakei Trump didn't "ready" shit except his pen and his veneers for the photo op.
859754954621411328 2017-05-03 13:02:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @funder @EnigmaNetxx Yes she is. We are Dems and she got our nomination. Bernie did not. Trump colluded with Putin to cheat HRC from her win. Bernie helped trump
859751852409270273 2017-05-03 12:49:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @HillaryClinton @funder Welcome back HRC. We've missed and needed you. We're a hell of a lot stronger than when you left. We are now WOKE.
859751376062210049 2017-05-03 12:47:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Oh they give two shits about not providing any "entitlements". They really only give two shits about themselves.
859634983635431424 2017-05-02 05:05:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @WhitfordBradley @jonfavs That really is some serious bullshit. If that had happened to a man, he'd be called a wimp or pussy for not speaking out about it.
859608689505951744 2017-05-02 03:20:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump NOT
859593953720635392 2017-05-02 02:22:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato Nice guy! What an ass.The Cons could care less about real people. It's all about big business and Super Pac $$$ for them.They lie constantly
859496530545397761 2017-05-02 19:55:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @CharlesMBlow @josephamodeo @TrumpFor2Terms Lol it had nothing to do with race to me. Kayleigh is offensive bc she's a trump shill and I don't think her womanly charms work on Charles
859426634713190400 2017-05-02 15:17:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @UWantMyVote_Why @DebbiejoGrisham He sure remembered his fab choc cake but was confused on who they used the Missiles on.
859426078422642691 2017-05-02 15:15:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @UWantMyVote_Why @DebbiejoGrisham So do I (lol) I guess I mean about their lying-they'll lie when it's totally obvious and for absolutely no reason almost automatically.
859425575668154369 2017-05-02 15:13:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @StandUpRepublic @ChereeMiller @MarlaMHughes Now says he's Independent. He's 100% better than Chaffetz, that's for sure. He seems pretty honest, but many do before they're elected.
859424123084312576 2017-05-02 15:07:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @UWantMyVote_Why @DebbiejoGrisham He may use it again and he may not. If he thinks it benefits him then he will & if not,he won't. But he'll remember saying it. This is Donny
859423669814276097 2017-05-02 15:05:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @UWantMyVote_Why @DebbiejoGrisham His thoughts are not rational or logical but that doesn't mean he doesn't remember. Narcissists are not rational or logical.
859413363125882881 2017-05-02 14:24:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @UWantMyVote_Why @DebbiejoGrisham He'll remember, he'll just lie.

859412430325112833 2017-05-02 14:21:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @JackArmada @Doodelay @kamerontyler Well just the pressure of knowing the FBI has the goods on him would do that. Also, more focus on him makes it seem like it's progressed.
859411945971122176 2017-05-02 14:19:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @thehill @JackArmada @kamerontyler He's pretty much been this way for many years. He's a narcissist which includes being a pathological liar.
859408676700004356 2017-05-02 14:06:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance This is funny but the crazy threat is not (we all know that dude has a stock pile of guns)
859407861964615682 2017-05-02 14:02:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @SenMarkey @tedlieu The only good news here, he doesn't really mean a damn thing he says.
859406399469694977 2017-05-02 13:57:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Nice try Donny, it's going to be a blood bath in 2018 for the Cons. Of course, it won't be relevant to you by then.
859404822226890754 2017-05-02 13:50:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @KimberlyBrown21 I agree. She's just like him in her theories but a lot smoother. Robot Barbie.
859404493284413441 2017-05-02 13:49:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs If you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem. YES
859404269530828800 2017-05-02 13:48:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs Sure, right after she talked the Chinese sweat shop she employs to sew her cheap dresses into paying workers 90 cents a day and not 1$.
859403397233090560 2017-05-02 13:45:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @governorbentley @LouiseMensch @rudepundit The Pres & VP & Sec of the Racist Old White Man's Club-Gross. They should all be in jail by now.

859393848312770560 2017-05-02 13:07:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Not just anti-abortion. She claims that birth control is not effective. Loves her Jesus. Crazy crap.

858324663562358785 2017-04-29 14:18:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @Salon Omg another one demon possessed, look at him, I first thought it was Flynn.
858322917024772096 2017-04-29 14:11:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @NanHughes7 @JoeNBC Quit watching you awhile ago, you're very late to this treason tribunal, lady I heard u speak you were on team trump. Too little, Too late!
858317498109886464 2017-04-29 13:50:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP No not this time, the crime is TREASON, this lil cover up is the tip of the iceberg, nothing more.
858317051273805824 2017-04-29 13:48:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou I now see that you are right. I voted for HRC but kind of thought Bernie was refreshing. I NO longer find him refreshing.
858309034755190785 2017-04-29 13:16:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @DemResistance @aravosis I've heard some say, if he does what he says he will with jobs then ACA won't matter bc jobs/ins will be better 
858308105788174336 2017-04-29 13:12:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @DemResistance @aravosis Well to be fair, it's Kentucky. I live here, I know of what I speak!
858150629419700224 2017-04-28 02:47:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @Amy_Siskind We knew that was coming because he can't stand that she's been doing a decent job-he's a petulant child who needs constant ego striking.
857977221587316736 2017-04-28 15:18:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @DemResistance @DerekCressman Definitely
857971411826159617 2017-04-28 14:54:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Maybe they should just give Rexon his Rosneft $$$ so he gets the hell out already.
857967076350230528 2017-04-28 14:37:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @keithboykin Winning!
857966181004832770 2017-04-28 14:34:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @Bertabright8 That's the one ;)
857944053660479488 2017-04-28 13:06:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @kylegriffin1 Well how the hell will they ever protect themselves? They should let them all carry and maybe they'd all take each other out!
857943569520308224 2017-04-28 13:04:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @imillhiser No way he's got some serious time to do in the slammer.
857942676330741762 2017-04-28 13:00:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Like the folks who don't want to be members of the union but expect all of the benefits.
857942122737094658 2017-04-28 12:58:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm Pretty sure Hannity's mouth is shaped like that for a reason. Bet he's pretty good with a "mic" too.
857937525511520257 2017-04-28 12:40:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepCummings @tenax666 @RVAwonk Consider? Wtf?

857932234443173888 2017-04-28 12:19:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou That's very idealistic Peter, Berkeley is a hornet's nest right now & it keeps getting ugly-not worth the obvious risk at this point.
857926393786769408 2017-04-28 11:56:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @lorismentality Well of course it was, of course I'm sure you'll be happy to share some of the blame with BHO because...he's a black man. CRAZY.
857925702104043520 2017-04-28 11:53:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @narceducator Never a truer statement, for them, it's all about the illusion of everything.
857923855792435200 2017-04-28 11:46:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @laurenduca Lol. Great job on Pod Save America! I thought it was the best one yet and I love them all! You should run for office (if ever interested)

857799361505394688 2017-04-27 03:31:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @GovMattBevin @realDonaldTrump @LouiseMensch @JasonMillerinDC Our loser Gov. It doesn't seem fair that one state (KY) should have to be saddled with Bevin, McConnell, & Paul. Trifecta of  Crooked Cons.
857618360976240640 2017-04-27 15:32:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan You are so fake and such a liar and a total crook.

857613787461025793 2017-04-27 15:13:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @MikeLevinCA He'll probably try to vote yes twice! He's among the worst. Not worth of selling used cars let alone congress. Hope you kick his ass!
857612008379830272 2017-04-27 15:06:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA @selectedwisdom Go get um Clint-you're good people and we appreciate your hard work and honesty.
857607875904122880 2017-04-27 14:50:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @jasoninthehouse @stealthygeek You trumpsters really like this "responsible" argument don't you? Dems get responsibility bud, that's why they call us the Elites.
857607276487741448 2017-04-27 14:48:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @jasoninthehouse Well maybe they could insert a heart, a brain, and some balls while they're at it? That's the EMERGENCY surgery you need Jas. You're a Joke!
857604797503086594 2017-04-27 14:38:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @politico @vardmin lol trouty mouth (there's definitely something very off about that guy) have you seen his beautiful girlfriend? She's proof he's very RICH!
857600962646740994 2017-04-27 14:22:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Alyssa_Milano @other_sebastian No conservative could back trump. No chance of him doing all of this ever. Can't get rid if him soon enough! Lock Him Up!
857387409188827136 2017-04-26 00:14:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @USARedOrchestra But it would be so good for the Uber Rich!!!
857385554673053696 2017-04-26 00:07:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Nothing to see there. What's the big deal, you guys are such sticklers for ethical behavior, get over it already. 
857379773638692864 2017-04-26 23:44:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @CatchaRUSSpy @jimsciutto I think they'll get a lil gift bag with samples of Ivanka's new perfume and a Donny secret decoder ring-winning.
857272386965655552 2017-04-26 16:37:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidYankovich @kharyp Also he REALLY wants to make rich people richer because they butter his bread.
857271762274353152 2017-04-26 16:34:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @mikefarb1 Can't wait to see how the Cons manage to oppose this.
857255633971707904 2017-04-26 15:30:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @DerekCressman I don't really agree with his politics but Kasish is at least honest.

857253858875236358 2017-04-26 15:23:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Thx ;)

857252593797562369 2017-04-26 15:18:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Maybe Flynn could put in a good word for them?

857251609050533888 2017-04-26 15:14:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @Khanoisseur Of course he did, he just drips of insincerity. If this gig doesn't pan out, he could give Joel Osteen a run for his money.

857249837921824768 2017-04-26 15:07:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @ThePlumLineGS Honestly, I only half mean this, but part of me wishes they'd do it so the Cons would be totally screwed in '18.
857248460315267072 2017-04-26 15:02:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @jennyzigrino This is ridiculous. We teach people how to treat us. #MarchForTruth #IndComm #SpecPros #DemocracyDecency May 27 USA Women's March x 2

857248093875691520 2017-04-26 15:00:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @CatchaRUSSpy We don't trust you Naveed. You're a Putin supporter too, so "believe" what you want to, but we don't believe you!
857244917193691136 2017-04-26 14:48:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @PersuasivePR He must be pretty dumb to not be more aware of surveillance.

857243698849087489 2017-04-26 14:43:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @mikefarb1 Wish I could say the same for KY! But at least we could manage to jettison abysmal McConnell!
857242808842891268 2017-04-26 14:39:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @NationalAction @EricHolder @JoyAnnReid Come on Dems, we must do better on this.
857242098432700418 2017-04-26 14:36:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @Twitter @TVietor08 Checking the Ossoff result :)
857241839358930944 2017-04-26 14:35:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS And he got totally burned every time he tried to deal with the SOB's. He should of had Putin be his pitch man, they clearly LOVE him.
857240905107079168 2017-04-26 14:32:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @voxdotcom @AynRandPaulRyan I mean did ANYBODY really believe that they'd take that crap themselves?
857240405481578496 2017-04-26 14:30:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @JenNimePalumbo @R0NBULL That and her/their monetary exploitation of the office (for me) from day one. It's totally out of control.
857239841976791040 2017-04-26 14:27:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @JenNimePalumbo Omg I didn't even get it at first (Just another reason Fox Fake News is the worst).
857239313599344641 2017-04-26 14:25:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou @mustlovemoving How many $$$$'s?
857239100872642561 2017-04-26 14:25:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @williamlegate His assumption that most Americans are simple minded enough to believe him, I find completely insulting.
857238752820940800 2017-04-26 14:23:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @williamlegate Yea,  because all  Paul Ryan wants to do is make this "simpler" for us, isn't he just the sweetest, most considerate man 
857223790039904256 2017-04-26 13:24:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou "But the Evil Muslims" and "stay the hell away from my 2nd amendment rights".
857223295707623425 2017-04-26 13:22:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidYankovich My sentiments exactly. I'm locked & loaded for that (my way of saying let's put Sarah Palin in there for good measure)
857220967470419972 2017-04-26 13:12:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @Artzthings I totally agree with Chris although I don't believe that "birtherism" was his own creation. No doubt he plagiarized that from some hate jock
857218763569213440 2017-04-26 13:04:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Nice Donnie, since we all know you had to beg, borrow and steal to get that joke of a SCOTUS in place so you could buy your verdicts. GROSS.
857216755420327936 2017-04-26 12:56:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @kbrunocrafts @CharlesMBlow Me either, I find it completely trashy and vulgar. That is to say, totally trump.

857101096388624388 2017-04-25 05:16:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch Certainly not Berkeley, they've had too many lately (which is that evil woman wants to go there)

857073417408917506 2017-04-25 03:26:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @bluestein @classynogin @DemLeftBehind You should probably ask Flynn, Manafort, McConnell, Ryan, Ross, Page, Prince, Tillerson, Spicer and trump that.

856709551588093952 2017-04-24 03:20:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Totally agree (I'm a Dem) but would have been fine with him as Pres-but none of the others and least of all trump! Rs have been corrupted
856709029241929728 2017-04-24 03:18:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Here's a rational/reasonable conservative and he never came close to winning.Instead Rs voted an idiot with no experience who lies none stop
856707739942244352 2017-04-24 03:13:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @JenniferJJacobs @evcrow Except for Russia!
856707059961745408 2017-04-24 03:10:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @jaketapper @JenniferJJacobs This is no doubt because Trudeau is so much cuter and more popular than trump is!
856703888459804673 2017-04-24 02:58:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @rogertansey Not Dems it's the Rs who called his bluff. Dems have NO POWER (and I'm a Dem) ;(

856669805717467137 2017-04-24 00:42:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedwoodGirl @garbagekate She did not: commit treason, lie compulsively, or grab others by the genitals. And Comey released damning letter about her days before
856668239354527744 2017-04-24 00:36:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidYankovich Ding, ding, ding, we have a winner!!!

856617693025316864 2017-04-24 21:15:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @OfficeGovEthics @CREWcrew @KellyannePolls @JoshSchwerin @NormEisen Hillary was not a good choice, I felt that way immediately. She couldn't beat a Black man with not much experience (I voted for BHO 2 times)
856616616808898560 2017-04-24 21:11:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @OfficeGovEthics @CREWcrew @KellyannePolls @JoshSchwerin @NormEisen Which I definitely see happening in near future.

856611449938075649 2017-04-24 20:50:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra Your national review article wasn't even about GOP COLLUDING with Russia/Comey and everyone of our intel agencies have verified Russian hack
856609696458960896 2017-04-24 20:44:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra I heard it when Comey said it

856597224565997568 2017-04-24 19:54:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @SaraCarterDC @RonBonJ How many investigations going on Obama???
856597103212204033 2017-04-24 19:53:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @SaraCarterDC @RonBonJ Crazy Talk. And they're still investigating FYI
856596053298225156 2017-04-24 19:49:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @SaraCarterDC @RonBonJ Maybe you could enlighten the FBI on that because they are investigating along with House and Senate
856595655921467393 2017-04-24 19:48:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder @RonBonJ Flynn, Nunes, Sessions, Chaffetz are out, so we will keep throwing. Maybe not so foolish after all?
856594518199730176 2017-04-24 19:43:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra That's not true. FBI HAS NOT SAID THAT. They've said they r investigating, and nothing else. House & senate still invest also but it's sham
856581486413312002 2017-04-24 18:51:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @OfficeGovEthics @CREWcrew @KellyannePolls @JoshSchwerin @NormEisen They don't own the majority of US citizens.
856581284121935873 2017-04-24 18:51:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @lovemrpibb2 @AidenWolfe @Lothar_Zogg Because he's independent but caucuses with them Dems
856579274958090242 2017-04-24 18:43:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @lovemrpibb2 @AidenWolfe @Lothar_Zogg I think we're a hell of a lot more united than the Rs (need to move beyond Bernie) there's a reason he's not a Dem
856578423258525696 2017-04-24 18:39:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @AidenWolfe Sorry to say I totally agree. Fire With Fire. Tired of being played for fools. This Dem is ready.

856576618667573249 2017-04-24 18:32:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra They're not even investigating Dems in Congress Dog-where do u get your "news"?
856576329139052545 2017-04-24 18:31:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra Yes it's the Dems who r going down! You're Right!!!

856575177156702208 2017-04-24 18:26:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra That's not even rational. Trump et al colluded with Russia & it will come out! (They r NOT even INVESTIGATING HRC or DNC) Deal with it Dog!
856573687763542016 2017-04-24 18:20:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul Really it's so contrary to all of their Patriot crap!
856573348020662272 2017-04-24 18:19:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder No time like the present!!!

856572390146494465 2017-04-24 18:15:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra Why still investigated? Forgot my personal least fav, Flynn
856569535838789632 2017-04-24 18:04:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra Don't hold your breadth Dog-we're not letting this go, time will prove us right! Sorry you backed a traitor, I'm sure you didn't know it
856569086180020224 2017-04-24 18:02:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra Well ob not there yet. But FBI has been invest for 9 months.Do U think they'd do that for nothing? Tillerson, Sessions,Manafort, Page,Prince

856566382317711360 2017-04-24 17:51:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra Lol you really are confused- what work from Congress? Rs don't even vote with other Rs!
856566082349543424 2017-04-24 17:50:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato I'm sure trump will get right on that 
856565595650838528 2017-04-24 17:48:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra Can't be bought, that's the most ironic of them all!Accept of course with Rosneft billions-wake up. Putin's been priming that pump for years
856564287594270724 2017-04-24 17:43:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @kurteichenwald Thanks McConnell you A hole!!! 2020 can't come soon enough here in KY!
856562956632502276 2017-04-24 17:38:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra Omg yet trump has flipped on so much in just 90+ days, ridiculous.
856562474581192704 2017-04-24 17:36:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @FreeAirPress Oh yes let's blame Trump's collusion with Russia on HRC (Dumb)
856562117813686272 2017-04-24 17:34:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch Good points, makes me feel better, thanks!
856561176427323393 2017-04-24 17:31:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorBurr @TeaPainUSA @cliffymil I'd say more scripted than fortuitous.
856560605142110209 2017-04-24 17:28:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @NBCNews @RepSwalwell @JanBrenner Yes because treason isn't really that big of deal ? Nothing trumps treason Jan, nothing! And Rs will never get all of that done, Never!
856559943398424577 2017-04-24 17:26:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepSwalwell Yes like Woman's March-only bigger!!! I'd def go to D.C. Again for that!!!
856559143947296771 2017-04-24 17:23:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepSwalwell Sing it Eric (I know you have been) get more support from Dem Congress! The people are Ready, we'll totally support you.
856558144960561152 2017-04-24 17:19:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @JKH2 Bernie's a little out there, doesn't speak for this Dem!
856557848083542016 2017-04-24 17:17:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @dailykos Though this would be more in my price range, I'd pitch a tent first!

856557059973763072 2017-04-24 17:14:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorBurr @TeaPainUSA @cliffymil Well I'm sure he didn't "pick" them.
856555780010639360 2017-04-24 17:09:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorBurr @RVAwonk @TeaPainUSA It's so ridiculous that we've let this go! If we can get rid of O'Reilly, then we can do this!!!
856555295178465280 2017-04-24 17:07:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @laurenduca Right after building the wall & repeal/replace before Saturday
856554672701812737 2017-04-24 17:05:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bakari_Sellers Omg, Please wake me up from this nightmare.
856553783106686977 2017-04-24 17:01:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra That's silly. What the Pres of US says is very imp to the world. Thinking about words is critical not devious. This is not "the Apprentice"
856552913522577408 2017-04-24 16:58:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @Evan_Rosenfeld @JenniferJJacobs Omg along with his buddies Douglass & Pavarotti.
856552008039497729 2017-04-24 16:54:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 @Dog4Zebra He was very "measured" which I appreciated then and REALLY appreciate it now! I don't look to Pres for "entertainment". Smart & controlled!
856546043726573568 2017-04-24 16:31:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 Works for me! Would u mind letting Donnie know that (just kidding)
856541421645561856 2017-04-24 16:12:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS44 @GoldenWayneMos1 Makes me really miss the days when our Pres could put words together to form a coherent thought :(
856534319866753024 2017-04-24 15:44:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 I sure as hell would never vote for her for Pres though!!!
856534154372161536 2017-04-24 15:43:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 I like Maxine bc she too calls it like she sees it, she's like 73 or so (don't care about her wig)
856533728268615681 2017-04-24 15:42:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 Ha Good luck with that one. But u did turn me on "snollygoster" 
856531058778664961 2017-04-24 15:31:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 Cool thanks I'll try to remember it-it's a new one for me
856530716250779649 2017-04-24 15:30:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 I guess I think it's funny to call somebody "real" when he's obviously not (superficially) honestly I'd make fun of that look from a Dem too
856529835879018496 2017-04-24 15:26:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 I did you're telling the truth! It's a good word!
856529557230321665 2017-04-24 15:25:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 Thanks just looked it up (don't think I've ever heard that before) do u think it's more Southern or Northern or neither? Just wondering?
856528240432861185 2017-04-24 15:20:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 Me too nice to chat! But what the hell is sollygaster?
856527302003445760 2017-04-24 15:16:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 In fairness u did call me insane/nuts but I'm the hater
856527188971196416 2017-04-24 15:16:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 Little sensitive, was it the "your" vs "you're" thing?
856526693514842112 2017-04-24 15:14:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 What scandals was he plagued with? I'm not saying he was perfect, but trump's had more scandal in 100 days than Obama had in 2 terms
856525715906453505 2017-04-24 15:10:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 But I know many did so there's obviously some reason they did (I think it's the outsider/looking for different thing) they certainly got it!
856525335596281856 2017-04-24 15:08:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 I know many did flip this election (don't get it at all) to me going from No drama Obama to trump is really just too much to understand.
856524638112927746 2017-04-24 15:06:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 It's "you're" not "your" :)
856524355051900929 2017-04-24 15:04:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 To be honest, before he opens his mouth. His died yellow fake hair and orange fake tan say it all for me.
856524035903160320 2017-04-24 15:03:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 I know that's what folks like. I think a Pres should be smart & articulate. I find him completely embarrassing Every time he opens his mouth
856523535103254529 2017-04-24 15:01:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 Don't buy two sides of same coin. Rs tend to support big business Ds tend to support the common man (I'm aware neither is 100%)
856522891629920257 2017-04-24 14:59:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 They sold his "successful businessman" thing very well and even that isn't really true-it's not like he was a CEO of a public co.
856522522258546689 2017-04-24 14:57:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 I get that but to me it's like saying I don't want a "career doctor" bc you understand/more comfortable with nurses aid for heart surgery.
856521936041644032 2017-04-24 14:55:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @GoldenWayneMos1 So what a snollgoster?
856521194937384962 2017-04-24 14:52:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 lol that's exactly what I'd say about Rs! Trump folks r totally cult like-they can't be bothered with facts/reality.
856520547777294336 2017-04-24 14:49:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 But it doesn't mean it's not true. Hillary isn't my fav either (I liked Biden) but she's WAY better than crazed Con man trump (in my mind).
856520172609339392 2017-04-24 14:48:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 The only reason he's been "successful" in business is because he's been laundering dirty Russian $$ for years. I know u don't believe that.
856519694920155136 2017-04-24 14:46:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 I know you feel that way. It's just so far from my  experience. He's not smart, he's a path liar, no exper in govt, he colluded with Russia.
856519007503101952 2017-04-24 14:43:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 Can't site a study but I have read "theories" that support it. Also, this has been my experience in life-just knowing folks in both parties.
856518429750251526 2017-04-24 14:41:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 But thank you for answering. I don't understand not voting. I think voting for Lesser of two evils is far better choice than not voting
856517759655706625 2017-04-24 14:38:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 Sad, you waited your whole life to vote for "good people" and went for trump. Just bc he uses "simple speech" does not make him a commoner.
856517247086493696 2017-04-24 14:36:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 News flash: trump is not "good people".
856517096825651200 2017-04-24 14:36:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 What is a snollygoster?
856516886032510976 2017-04-24 14:35:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @dtaythecat2190 @GoldenWayneMos1 Clearly you don't "see through people's lies" you voted for trump.
856516565839343618 2017-04-24 14:33:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 I wouldn't say that but I would say that Rs tend to be very black/white no grey area for many. I think progressives see lots of grey.
856514233470767105 2017-04-24 14:24:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 No the "some" part was in reference to "some of them are ok people" GROSS
856513766611091460 2017-04-24 14:22:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 Care to cite that "study"???
856513626936664064 2017-04-24 14:22:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @DannyZuker @justinhendrix @piscata_antonio Seriously, if snowflake is your worst criticism well that says it all!
856513088052449280 2017-04-24 14:20:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 That's crazy talk!
856512757377773572 2017-04-24 14:18:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 Serious question, why are you just voting for the first time in your life? (Just hard for me to understand) looking for insight.
856511726279417856 2017-04-24 14:14:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @NathanLerner @dtaythecat2190 Fewer Americans voted for racist trump than did. In France, majority rules, no electoral college.
856510390007717888 2017-04-24 14:09:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 He said, They're "rapists and drug dealers" when in fact they break the law less than native born Americans. That's racist.
856509517659590656 2017-04-24 14:05:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 Actually it's fewer Mexicans & more Central Americans (but that's way to subtle a point for trump or his followers)
856498812046774273 2017-04-24 13:23:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @dtaythecat2190 He said Mexicans! Does it make it better if I say Hispanic people?
856497852759126017 2017-04-24 13:19:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @vickimorris191 I've come to realize "constitutionalist" is code for racist gun lover-nice.
856497335295201281 2017-04-24 13:17:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @politicoalex @IsaacDovere As well they should. We in KY will definitely be using it to dethrone McConnell in 2020, you can bet your sweet bippy on that!
856496591196356608 2017-04-24 13:14:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytimes He's a lie and a cheat, perfect bud for trump!
856496099661672448 2017-04-24 13:12:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 @NoFilterOnMe1 If you look at this election & say that it's HRC who cheated, you're delusional too! He colluded with Putin to steal this election!
856495279197085696 2017-04-24 13:09:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @DannyZuker @justinhendrix @piscata_antonio "Go Trump" "keep sounding deranged"??? Now that's pretty dumb.
856495103132798976 2017-04-24 13:08:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @DannyZuker @justinhendrix @piscata_antonio We are far from melting, we're chilled and ready for the long hall-sorry, the snowflake thing is not true either! And we work!
856492901370667008 2017-04-24 12:59:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @justinhendrix This latest AP piece, I could only get about 1/3 of the way into it, it's SO BAD!
856492311508922368 2017-04-24 12:57:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @ValerieOMcVey So true.
856486431463788544 2017-04-24 12:34:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @dailykos Nice gun ad ;(
856484748977418241 2017-04-24 12:27:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @my_zox @sarahkendzior @MollyIsles He has guts Molly, he's not right in the head. It's not guts he lacks.
856484208172310528 2017-04-24 12:25:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @my_zox @sarahkendzior @MollyIsles Many of us could do better-he's a narcissistic nut job! Wake up already!
856481660572971010 2017-04-24 12:15:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Fake News is Real and it's really bad for democracy
856480904109228034 2017-04-24 12:12:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @nirvanafanclub @MollyIsles Well she was 1000 times more fit than this crazy idiot!
856480475979935746 2017-04-24 12:10:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Wow, I mean if that doesn't say it all about trump. And 0 awareness how off that is, at all. He's very damaged obviously. But Rally in PA!
856477908336037888 2017-04-24 12:00:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @HCHyson @mltaylor13pt1 @Thelast_try @shtooky Bingo!!! He can't stop (so to me) he's not consciously aware, or he'd stop. Because his lies are really bringing him down, among many things
856477032737374209 2017-04-24 11:56:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @HCHyson @mltaylor13pt1 @Thelast_try @shtooky Totally agree here, "I'm like a smart person". I just don't think he realizes they're lies any more than he knows he's a dim bulb.
856474703950745600 2017-04-24 11:47:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @HCHyson @mltaylor13pt1 @Thelast_try @shtooky He lies in so many obvious & dumb ways, like claiming he has tax plan by Wednesday, like cont lies about crowd size, narcissists get lies.
856472463814922241 2017-04-24 11:38:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @HCHyson @mltaylor13pt1 @Thelast_try @shtooky I'm really not convinced he does know. (Not absolving him at all) it's like he's gotten away w lies for so long, he's incapable of not lying
856470852652720128 2017-04-24 11:32:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @HCHyson @mltaylor13pt1 @Thelast_try I now call their local office bc someone answers those #'s
856370743789146112 2017-04-23 04:54:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @jaketapper @BrendanNyhan I'm sure you'll post an apology when it is proven to be true. It's not "conspiracy theory" if it's true.
856364899995398144 2017-04-23 04:31:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @PersuasivePR @Unpersuaded112 That is a very sad truth!
856361012399935488 2017-04-23 04:15:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 Yea, that means a lot from the dude who calls himself deplorable. He kicked off his campaign with Racist comments about Mexicans-He's Racist
856340310103908352 2017-04-23 02:53:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @HCHyson @mltaylor13pt1 @KathyC1948 @Thelast_try They should be scared. He's bad for the country but also really bad for R party. He's not loyal to them at all & they will pay huge price
856337781332881408 2017-04-23 02:43:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @paulsmathers @NanHughes7 @Jmacliberty Well really their chief complaint against him was that he was black so he couldn't change that to make them happy (I was naive to extent)
856332818670129154 2017-04-23 02:23:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @UWantMyVote_Why @impeach_d_trump He's deranged.
856330385659224064 2017-04-23 02:14:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @poroshenko @AndreaChalupa @jimsciutto Yes that's nice we still don't trust any of them and want Ind Com to investigate #TrumpRussia, #DonTheCon #ChickenDon
856329150155694080 2017-04-23 02:09:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @HCHyson @mltaylor13pt1 @Thelast_try We all must work tirelessly to shame Repub congress to do the right thing and have Ind Comm & Ind Pros to investigate #TrumpRussia now!!!

856322649169027073 2017-04-23 01:43:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu None that was campaign bull crap, even his base knew that! They just liked the racist side of that wall, plain and simple!
856321321709576192 2017-04-23 01:38:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @ericgarland Yes it's gross and we must rise above it and shut it down. Politically Correct is Correct!
856319828772233216 2017-04-23 01:32:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @HCHyson @geralds1 Yes I have a friend whose son is crying all the time :(

856316567537233921 2017-04-23 01:19:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @marcslove @JamieLund11 I'm pretty sure it's not a "conspiracy theory" if it's true.
856315752634347521 2017-04-23 01:15:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @marcslove @Proud_Veteran_ No kidding they love that crap, current president included ;(
856315143134867456 2017-04-23 01:13:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @marcslove We will all have to see about that but I don't think you're going to like what you see.
856314510621233152 2017-04-23 01:11:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw Well his "want to spend more time with family" was so obviously not true (I'm guessing it's true) Jason is REALLY SLIMEY!
856313329953931270 2017-04-23 01:06:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @tedlieu Well apparently they do, they made you AG!

856301507104342017 2017-04-23 00:19:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm Seriously revealing, I don't call him Narcissist in Chief for nothing. He's like an emotionally challenged 7th grader, in every way.
856300379180552192 2017-04-23 00:14:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @VicenteFoxQue @MichelleLinder9 @svfd_242 @cadburyisbest1 And trump's trying to cut budget to Coast Gaurd? The sad truth is, as long as there's a market, the drugs will find a way to get here!
856299880494575616 2017-04-23 00:12:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @kybassmaster123 Being truthful is nice. What do u mean "before Obama over"?
856298835659948032 2017-04-23 00:08:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @kybassmaster123 That's wrong. ACA is basically Romneycare. That's pretty Republican!
856298414895767552 2017-04-23 00:07:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @AndreBauerSC Rough night? Looks like you forgot to shave Andre? HAve u fallen hard times?
856298008501211138 2017-04-23 00:05:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @kybassmaster123 That can't happen, ACA will still be in place when trump is removed from office. Maybe u can advise him on that?
856296915910176768 2017-04-23 00:01:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @kybassmaster123 Besides Rs will never pass healthcare bc they're so divided, some want to just repeal (freedom caucus) and some know they can't bc of votes!
856296606022455296 2017-04-23 23:59:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @kybassmaster123 Yes that's why Dems have been screaming so loudly at town halls everywhere! If Rs would help, it could be fixed, but they want it to fail.
856295841153331200 2017-04-23 23:56:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @kybassmaster123 Ok you're not right, why did you receive that? Were you a frequent flier at his Cult Rallies? You ob did something & you're proud of it-what
856295215396737024 2017-04-23 23:54:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @VicenteFoxQue @justfinethanx @svfd_242 TREASON, RICO CHARGES. Might take awhile, but we'll get there. Not just trump, many other Rs as well-bunch of Crooks! #DonTheCon
856294474317746176 2017-04-23 23:51:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @VicenteFoxQue @cadburyisbest1 @MichelleLinder9 @svfd_242 Stop watching Fox Fake news & read something real
856292838677630976 2017-04-23 23:44:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @AndreBauerSC You're full of bull! trump's first 100 day have been total disaster! CNN needs to stop having u on tv-you parrot same lies over & over!
856287994013245441 2017-04-23 23:25:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @SaraCarterDC @SUPERCYN Total crap. He was forced by Rudy and trump NY FBI who were going to leak the story. He now has freedom to invest #TrumpRussia bring it on!!
856287017369554946 2017-04-23 23:21:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @SaraCarterDC Why aren't you covering all of the real scandal in trump admin? Oh bc you're completely biased & stuck on same old shit? SAD! BAD! WRONG! :)
856286006772998144 2017-04-23 23:17:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @SaraCarterDC Yes Sara it's the unmasking that's important, not the colluding with Russia. Comet has already shut that down, guess u missed?
856274539713527808 2017-04-23 22:32:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @seanhannity @TeaPainUSA NO SURPRISE THERE. Sean as gross as Bill O. Hope he meets with the same fate!
856273926443470849 2017-04-23 22:29:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @PaulRizzo504 I'd say we're on our way (accept maybe his lowest base) they're pretty hopeless it seems.
856272848905785344 2017-04-23 22:25:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @PaulRizzo504 I really have to agree with you. Maybe not now but ultimately, yes. We are now woke. Just went to red Louisville Science March!
856271879480512512 2017-04-23 22:21:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @RobinAAR @kjalee If they have any sense, they will.
856268836320010240 2017-04-23 22:09:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @hemplify We have steel plants. He didn't even have his MAGA hats made here. I'm not young/naive. It's not "your" it's "you're"
856267289070637056 2017-04-23 22:03:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii Yes Bill, please hold your breadth on that!
856266890414632961 2017-04-23 22:01:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @hemplify I have no idea what you mean to say here.
856266298958991360 2017-04-23 21:59:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @kybassmaster123 I'm aware of Obama's deportation moves, he also passed ACA, kept us out of war, + stimulus package, increased jobs (not al all Repub)!
856264987819560960 2017-04-23 21:54:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @hemplify There are textile co here (many have closed), wine?, steel?, workers? He's a total hypocrite Maggie!
856264306073247744 2017-04-23 21:51:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @kybassmaster123 Now Mike, exactly how much did you have to pay for that and how do you "advise" him? I don't think it's me who has to open my eyes.
856238659175149569 2017-04-23 20:09:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @kybassmaster123 He doesn't care about either of us-deal with it deplorable
856224340408496129 2017-04-23 19:12:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scotus @mitchellvii @ErwrightWright @ColBannister What Fake news source did that come from?
856224069993287680 2017-04-23 19:11:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scotus @mitchellvii @ErwrightWright @ColBannister Lol what about trump's Treason? Obama did nothing was Treasonous-that's ridiculous!
856221258220015620 2017-04-23 19:00:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @CHHR01 Oh yea they seem really scared! Wake up, he's right there with them.
856220942015623168 2017-04-23 18:59:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @hemplify Of which he does neither (actions louder than words)!!!
856220693540872192 2017-04-23 18:58:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @kybassmaster123 He doesn't give two shits about you, the little person, you've been conned!
856220363566534657 2017-04-23 18:56:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @Scotus @mitchellvii @ColBannister @ErwrightWright Yes it's great to have ignorant people trying to dismantle the government!
856219931037368320 2017-04-23 18:55:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @GoldenWayneMos1 You could be honest and say his racist policies!
856219702204530688 2017-04-23 18:54:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii @Feduporiginal lol Brilliant!!!
856219492384468993 2017-04-23 18:53:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @mitchellvii lol that's pretty funny!!!
856192950723891200 2017-04-23 17:08:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump My God, you really don't have a bottom for how low you are willing to go, do you?
856191109281832964 2017-04-23 17:00:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Great, We'll take that up front, thank you!
856180875851124736 2017-04-23 16:20:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @GovMattBevin @ASlavitt Matt Bevin is (no surprise) a completely hypocritical "Tea Party Christian" with rainbow colored adopted children to prove it-Gross!
856161156788084736 2017-04-23 15:01:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @mcuban No respect for you Mark, wtf were you doing meeting with Bannon?
856159827353055233 2017-04-23 14:56:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @mikefarb1 I totally believe this to be true. I don't understand how he's managed to get away with this for so long. Any Thoughts?
856152148438024192 2017-04-23 14:25:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland Why is it that the same folks who claim to love God so much also love their guns just as much? This combo makes NO sense to me what so ever.
856145542988083200 2017-04-23 13:59:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @JeffreyGoldberg @allahpundit No more Clintons, and I'm a Dem. Dynasties are nice but not when they lose. Way too many lies about them to win, we need to let it go!
856142912622661632 2017-04-23 13:49:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder Hope they have a lot of support staff, they're certainly going to need it!
855957216423272448 2017-04-22 01:31:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato Really, they are among the most hypocritical in DC. Only conservative when convenient.
855930568785231872 2017-04-22 23:45:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee @antonejohnson Sorry to hear that. It's never easy to see them go, even if it's time. Thoughts are with you.
855907334589231104 2017-04-22 22:13:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChelseaClinton I used to work with young kids (0-3) quite a few lil ones skipped "three" because they couldn't say it very well, is that the case with her?
855889453549834240 2017-04-22 21:02:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Donnie, progressives know that's a bold faced lie and your base doesn't give a shit so really, why bother with the lip service?
855883619491041281 2017-04-22 20:38:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @ALT_uscis Jonesing for the applause again? This is NOT what we meant by "transparency" trump. The narcissist in chief needs constant reaffirmation-SAD
855860369738412033 2017-04-22 19:06:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @mansoortshams @LouiseMensch I'm afraid America has lost sight of that in the name of Jesus, which doesn't really make sense to me. United We Stand, Divided We Fall.
855854423213559808 2017-04-22 18:42:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @Shorewife @3catsandme3 McConnell and Rand Paul are the Senators from KY.  Somehow they get elected in a very poor state and vote AGAINST the poor. #PayToPlay
855835736561635328 2017-04-22 17:28:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @Shorewife For me, I look most forward to watching McConnell & Ryan fall, but I'll enjoy each and every one immensely.
855834708386750466 2017-04-22 17:24:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @UWantMyVote_Why @TrueFactsStated I'm pretty sure he's a real live Evil Elf! In fact, I demand to see his birth certificate because many people are saying he's not a human.
855829622033874947 2017-04-22 17:04:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @womensmarch @LittleMissFlint Isn't she just beautiful, the future looks good for our movement, future Scientists unite :)
855828531175141378 2017-04-22 16:59:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @TrueFactsStated @NancyCatLover The hippy dippy doctor man? Anybody who accepted his "doctor's note" as legit, deserves what they're getting!
855791247243583488 2017-04-22 14:31:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones This really makes me sick, Mr Choir Boy had no  issues with that I'm sure.
855790396458356736 2017-04-22 14:28:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Yea, Screw you Alex, what goes around, comes around!

855764370806145024 2017-04-22 12:44:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton @funder Such a good Christian man! What a damn hypocrite. He really isn't very convincing as a good guy, it's very contrived and phony.
855601187638345729 2017-04-21 01:56:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @JonSchnepp @LawyerRogelio @CloezfulGaming @EJB1704 Because he and his people were totally complicit, obviously.

855159217027723265 2017-04-20 20:40:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @JimDalrympleII @jzbelle God no he's a libertarian (far from a Dem) Hes just honest, so he's better than almost all Repubs by comparison!
855158205256798208 2017-04-20 20:36:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @JimDalrympleII No surprise there. I don't care for his politics, but, at least he SEEMS Honest and reasonably intelligent, 100% better than Chaffetz.
855154309125869569 2017-04-20 20:20:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Bahahaha I'd already forgotten about that stupid comment.
855153563080822785 2017-04-20 20:17:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff Yes, Thank God . Too bad the Repubs won't do their jobs in Congress because they're supposed to be checks/balance but they're complicit!

855077241952272384 2017-04-20 15:14:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen That's exactly right! People just aren't quite as stupid as they think they are, well at least those on the Left aren't.
855074597183643648 2017-04-20 15:04:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @PrincessBravato Not anywhere even close!
855073370072899589 2017-04-20 14:59:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @BethW_NoTrump What about FACTS on Ailes, the guy in charge of Fox, they weren't relevant? Ridiculous.Corporations only pulling bc they were shamed into it

855063767520083970 2017-04-20 14:21:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @SarahPalinUSA @POTUS @jaketapper Barf, when "this" is all over, they're going to need to tent and fumigate that place.
855063390959566848 2017-04-20 14:19:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton Uhh no, they needed their votes. I don't think "we don't give a shit about real people, only big business $$$" really works so well.
855062246908715008 2017-04-20 14:15:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @BethW_NoTrump No Beth, these rumors/stories have been going for years, exactly where was their "conscience" then? No credit where credit Not Due!

855058428032675840 2017-04-20 13:59:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenatorBurr @DenbrotS It's SO out of control-WTF is wrong with Republicans pretending they don't know what's going on-hold them accountable for their choices!!!
855052646906044417 2017-04-20 13:36:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @laurenduca Omg Total Trump Trash!
855049654349815808 2017-04-20 13:24:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @StollmeyerEU Just like US-that's sad, sure hope they learned their lesson through US.

855033144831074304 2017-04-20 12:19:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC @coolmom519 No kidding, if we liked him we'd be watching Fox.
855031689222946816 2017-04-20 12:13:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Sure can't say the same for you! Allies like our approach-are you even serious? Tell that to Merkel. He's a Traitor Joe-do they Like that?
854857120713502722 2017-04-19 00:39:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder She's awful! Female version of O'Reilly. No Thanks.
854847171946041344 2017-04-19 00:00:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @mikefarb1 Pretty sure it's Alt Right thing (pretty Arian looking, aren't they?)
854845035371692033 2017-04-19 23:51:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenJohnMcCain @sarahkendzior Both he and Marco new that for sure and then they just pretended they didn't know it anymore. I knew it & I just watch cable news!!!
854770620407709696 2017-04-19 18:56:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas I'm glad they ended up finding our armada-idiots abound in the White House. Taxes & IndComm needed desperately now-this is beyond ridiculous
854703274888491009 2017-04-19 14:28:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @RealDonaldTrFan That's clearly true, just look at how many voted for you!!!
854546364830814208 2017-04-18 04:05:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @watzgoinonhere @Amy_Siskind Another filthy rich dirty old man-it's time to get them all the hell out of our White House. They're not nearly worthy and cheated to win.
854543660502966272 2017-04-18 03:54:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA Bahaha Tea Pain, you never disappoint. You keep it real but also funny. That's no small feat because trump and treason are rarely funny.
854540251297185792 2017-04-18 03:40:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder @71lugnut Yes, that's what FBI is working on and you can call it Lame or Fake News. We snowflakes don't care. We call it "get their lying asses out".
854535945626038272 2017-04-18 03:23:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @davebernstein @ECmadtown Wow I thought the "suicide" was sad, this is BAD and SAD.
854532353913491456 2017-04-18 03:09:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA Great job on Chris Hayes tonight. There are still some Republicans who are ethical but they're pretty few and far between. Party is corrupt.
854475030302011393 2017-04-18 23:21:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @MailOnline @Reveille1au @RedFunMachine1 @DoctorRobin @Msdiva74CLS Oh wow I'm being ripped off, I only get a million per tweet but also another million per protest & I've done a lot of protests!!!
854466616356163584 2017-04-18 22:48:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @StevenLHall1 Do enjoy you though Steve!
854466446285561856 2017-04-18 22:47:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @StevenLHall1 Oh God can't stand him or others like him. But just their politics but the depth they are willing to reach is disgusting.

854337999789805568 2017-04-18 14:17:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenDeanHeller Still want to know your answer to how many Russian spies need to be in the WH before you investigate? You're a stain on our democracy.
854324885237137408 2017-04-18 13:24:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @ShadowingTrump Welcome aboard, I hope you drain that well dry.

854311830654681088 2017-04-18 12:33:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @jfreewright Weasley POS!
854311419550076928 2017-04-18 12:31:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix I can't decide which is worse 1. The Pres leAves and plays golf at his private club 30% of time or 2. This idiot Pres stats in DC & rules.
854303258441125890 2017-04-18 11:59:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @watzgoinonhere @TrueFactsStated NONE!!!
854297642234458112 2017-04-18 11:36:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Seems like you're pretty nervous donnie.
854168703247757312 2017-04-17 03:04:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @TonyCowdrey I have hope that Ryan hoes to prison with the rest of Republican crooks!
854164254391504900 2017-04-17 02:46:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Running scared are you? Good, you should be.
854159593848623104 2017-04-17 02:28:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch Ryan is so creepy, I really can't stand him and it looks like I'm far from alone.
854144882428059649 2017-04-17 01:29:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeteButtigieg @tribelaw @CaliforniaFirst He's very smart (Harvard I think) very down to earth but articulate at the same time! He was in Pod Save America (podcast) prob a month ago.
854143955067428865 2017-04-17 01:26:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @PeteButtigieg @tribelaw Yes Mayor Pete is great-hope he keeps rising in the Party. Young And smart, great contrast to the Republican options.
854075867877789697 2017-04-17 20:55:29 UTC <LOLGOP> Ted Cruz still believes he's slick. Remember that next time you feel down about yourself.https://twitter.com/amanbatheja/status/854075276460003330

853973562901893120 2017-04-17 14:08:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @brianklaas Good lord it just keeps getting worse! These people aren't even trying to hide it anymore. International hired guns and proud of it-SHAMEFUL
853951111048441857 2017-04-17 12:39:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidYankovich Talk is cheap Paul, where's the hope in your fake healthcare plan and crappy budget plan to take from poor and give to rich?
853950738741026818 2017-04-17 12:38:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidYankovich Total hypocrite Fake alter boy Ryan, we know you take from the poor and give to the rich. You really only care about big donor $$-it's ckear
853946703363407874 2017-04-17 12:22:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC Isn't that little smirk of his so nasty.
853935447814410240 2017-04-17 11:37:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @judicialnetwork Go screw yourself McConnell, you've lied and cheated at every turn.
853755746558914560 2017-04-16 23:43:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @MrDane1982 POS. Which you can tell just by looking at him.
853751786569641984 2017-04-16 23:27:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @GOP @grandmahannah @4everNeverTrump Dems need to stop allowing ourselves to be cheated-the Rs are champs at cheating the system and we need to stay woke about that too.
853691608423944192 2017-04-16 19:28:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @th3j35t3r @realDonaldTrump And people say he's not consistent, small hand & small mind.
853688602471133185 2017-04-16 19:16:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow War makes for a nice diversion from treason but we are still staying woke-we're not going to forget.
853608985357946880 2017-04-16 14:00:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Protested for Freedom not free. Tweeting this crap only makes you look more ridiculous (it's very "unpresidented")
853608313812123648 2017-04-16 13:57:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Rough morning? Too bad Jared & Ivanka can't stop the crazy tweets today! Happy Easter!!!
853608030126133248 2017-04-16 13:56:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump We are just getting warmed up Donnie-Enjoy!!!
853607452742385664 2017-04-16 13:54:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Lots & lots. & lots of folks doing the chicken dance for you yesterday Donnie-were you proud???
853606436185755648 2017-04-16 13:50:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump We could have a functioning State Dept but you don't want that because you want that Russian oil $$$ and most of us know it-you're a FAKE!!!
853603829585252353 2017-04-16 13:39:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @sethmoulton Yes he would but most know, THERE WAS COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA (by many) & GOP cont to pretend they don't know (they're complicit) as hell.
853602866824704000 2017-04-16 13:35:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid So Gross-International Embarrassment!
853602408534089728 2017-04-16 13:34:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @rmasher2 Yes that's right. And the GOP is fine with that as long as they raise taxes on poor, lower on rich, deny healthcare, get extreme SCOTUS.
853601237673103361 2017-04-16 13:29:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix MAGA folks really believe Dems don't work-I never realized how pervasive that lie was until this debacle (WE DO WORK).
853600611136413696 2017-04-16 13:26:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch Isn't that just like "access to good healthcare"?
853598733723996166 2017-04-16 13:19:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenJohnMcCain @EllenMorris1222 @LouiseMensch @DownGoesOskars Very true! Look what he said about going nuclear-and then did!
853598433931874304 2017-04-16 13:18:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch Worthless to believe in equality of opportunity if you do nothing to insure it (GOP does lots to deny it) and you know it. Go Dem.
853595898940719104 2017-04-16 13:08:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @bitchyologist No fear of muslims here.

853229898575618049 2017-04-15 12:53:54 UTC <HenslerKate> @bitchyologist I think that's pretty simplistic. Racism, Islamaphobia, white supremacy and Putin and Comey also played a big part. Haters gonna hate!
853224600653713410 2017-04-15 12:32:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @wtf_imtooold @bitchyologist @MotherResister Sadly there are still quite a few. They say, "he's doing exactly what he said he's gonna" I really think many liked his racist views best.
853222588729970688 2017-04-15 12:24:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix These folks are sick and need to be stopped.
853221060220727296 2017-04-15 12:18:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump I couldn't get oats you saying Passover-Mr reality show president you're really not good at this. Quit, oh wait, not necessary is it.
853036159190085633 2017-04-14 00:04:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @joshtpm @Susan_Hennessey Great point. Makes me wonder if he actually tweeted them but I guess all covered on Fox every AM and PM.  Nothing what so ever absorbed.

852950920476467200 2017-04-14 18:25:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @SethAbramson Totally disgraceful
852933775881273345 2017-04-14 17:17:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @bogucki_john Well neither do I obviously but I'm convinced he's wrong (made me question his judgement or loyalty though)
852932249582530562 2017-04-14 17:11:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @bogucki_john Oh I'm very convinced that he did collude With Russia, just wondering if you had any insight to Morell saying that? It surprised me.
852919867669983232 2017-04-14 16:21:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @bogucki_john Well I'm not ageeeing with him (at all) I don't doubt that he still has some very good connections
852918054321364993 2017-04-14 16:14:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @bogucki_john I'm not greAt at that i just googled Michael morell and no fire and it came first

852913600452857856 2017-04-14 15:57:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @bogucki_john Let me see if I can find (I've thought highly of him & then he says that recently-???)
852913417405046785 2017-04-14 15:56:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones @DavidCornDC Haven't thought of this term in many years, he's a fuck wad.
852911937612414976 2017-04-14 15:50:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @bogucki_john He said it on either CNN or MSNBC in last couple of weeks (I was shocked)
852911220587974657 2017-04-14 15:47:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @bogucki_john Well ok I know that but why did Morell say "no fire" recently?
852907671359455232 2017-04-14 15:33:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @dailykos What can Dems do to help?
852906969774137344 2017-04-14 15:30:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @bogucki_john He's not pro trump but still said this just weeks ago? Any insight?
852906659068465153 2017-04-14 15:29:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @bogucki_john Oh you mean the guy who resent my said there's a little smoke here but "no fire at all". (This was bizarre bc I've respected him in past)
852901332558245888 2017-04-14 15:08:18 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Yes I understand that but question whether or not he's capable. The shit is going down now, he'd be a fool to side with trump/wiki now.
852900705295884288 2017-04-14 15:05:48 UTC <HenslerKate> I hadn't read that but do follow Louise Mench who's been tweeting about same info. It sounds like they're circling the wagons :)
852898385149513729 2017-04-14 14:56:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @brianklaas When people elect an entitled idiot to run the country, they get an entitled idiot to run the country.
852896728026140672 2017-04-14 14:50:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs Uh no not even a second of surprise in fact totally knew this the second he tweeted about #44 (god I wish the days when we had smart adult)
852894777666404354 2017-04-14 14:42:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS ???
852894140618743808 2017-04-14 14:39:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @intelligencer Ridiculous to blame her. Despite so much effort, Congress had nothing tangible. Trump et all colluded with Russia, Coney 10 days, but she??
852891193696546817 2017-04-14 14:28:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @MaxineWaters Totally it seems patently obvious to me too Maxine. Keep telling it like it is!

852890680838021120 2017-04-14 14:25:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Was he non partisan when he was a R rep from Kansas just months ago?
852890156701020160 2017-04-14 14:23:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP I'd say that's generous, W wasn't a narcissist who was frequently unhinged, to be fair.
852888966038786048 2017-04-14 14:19:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Or he's running from a sinking ship like a rat trying to save himself.
852868207325175808 2017-04-14 12:56:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 Yes those 3 are awful and say the same stupide stuff over and over. If that's the best they can do they should quit trying.

852865828152279040 2017-04-14 12:47:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @ManikTyagi @navyxman Wrong, exactly what example can you give that proves your theory (what other country)?

852857425497554944 2017-04-14 12:13:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost As if they don't already! If it is official, they can pay taxes.
852751271673053187 2017-04-13 05:12:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenateMajLdr @judicialnetwork Traitor to KY, Senate, Democracy. 2020 can't come soon enough. Dems need great candidate to Ditch Mitch. He'll be 79 years old-Got To Go!!!

852574839030394881 2017-04-13 17:30:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Didn't you hear, bombing helps Trump's numbers.
852484172107177987 2017-04-13 11:30:39 UTC <HenslerKate> @ACLU Since the Authoritarian leader trump "took" office.
852483777465114624 2017-04-13 11:29:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @TIME What are you saying he lied?

852351762065502208 2017-04-12 02:44:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @chrislhayes @MSNBC @RepSwalwell Just caught the end. It's a great idea-hope you'll be utilizing millennial oriented media approaches. Snapchat, Instagram, etc

852230718344355840 2017-04-12 18:43:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @kastacherkim @margbrennan @artist4ever @dancindoti I mean, look at how the Fox woman look so unprofessional & get objectified by the likes ok R Ailes & B O'Reilly. Talk about an old boys club
852229772008673281 2017-04-12 18:39:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @RVAwonk It pains me to hear the crazy ramblings of our narcissist in chief. I will never be a passive democrat again. Deplorable doesn't suffice.

852169847479906305 2017-04-12 14:41:38 UTC <HenslerKate> Yes, they're the industrialists and that's who supports the GOP. It's time that real people realize this once and for all, it's sick.

852144800459628545 2017-04-12 13:02:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxineWaters Thanks for the reminder, Auntie Maxine, you're exactly right, it's really all about those sanctions.
852143503077507073 2017-04-12 12:56:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Seems worse to me too (he's really really really nutso) trump sure can pick um.
852142408196337666 2017-04-12 12:52:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @funder He is terrible but I kind of like him there because a decent press sec might give the illusion that WH is decent-and it's anything but.
852140718474842113 2017-04-12 12:45:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @MalcolmNance @Evan_McMullin That's right Evan, it's been obvious from the minute he was chosen. He could hVe had Romney,who made good sense. But he chose Rexxon instead

852138528096083968 2017-04-12 12:37:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @sethmoulton Good job on "Morning Joe" today Congressman, keep it up, Dems need some articulate younger leaders, we're with you.

852119778173095937 2017-04-12 11:22:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonlovett @JamesThompsonKS Because we actually have values-other than tax the poor & give to rich, cater to big business, cut healthcare & services for women. We care.
852011104846741504 2017-04-11 04:10:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @FareedZakaria Heard what you said rt bombing Syria made trump president. I had respect for you, I no longer do. It wasn't the "babies" it was #TrumpRussia
852009938553405440 2017-04-11 04:06:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @ILTVNews @MeravMichaeli @AlanDersh Using the "We bombed Syria, so we've negated the #TrumpRussia story". Did Eric trump tell you that? Sir, we're just getting warmed up!

851964980492677121 2017-04-11 01:07:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCAA @JoyAnnReid Still dominated by repugs, they also sneakily passed law before he came into office to limit his power (old school redneck)
851962015576969216 2017-04-11 00:55:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCAA @JoyAnnReid @GOPsucksass That's awesome, happy for you both!
851961182042959872 2017-04-11 00:52:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @NCAA @JoyAnnReid @Bareham2016 Especially ugly that they're very good at using Jesus to back up their hate.

851898076419809281 2017-04-11 20:41:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @ManikTyagi @perisb I would agree with that, even though, many don't like to hear it. Unfortunately that's just reality. Payment determines course of tx now.
851887946940776448 2017-04-11 20:01:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @BraddJaffy The fact that that idiot is press sec really says it all about trump & Co.-don't they see how often he steps in his own turds?
851870286177849344 2017-04-11 18:51:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @EyalL @ManikTyagi In what country does this system actually exist?
851862879322206208 2017-04-11 18:21:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @ManikTyagi @EyalL Exactly because the prices are regulated by government. It's really the only way to get it under any kind of control.
851849989177389057 2017-04-11 17:30:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @WilliamPecota @ManikTyagi That's not realistic. If Single Pay works for U.K., France, Canada, Spain, Australia ..,its proven its worth I'm in (those Cos happy mostly)
851848300848435200 2017-04-11 17:23:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @SSestanovich Saw you on Wolf. I can think of 19 billion $ reasons Donnie's fake missile strike will work . You're the expert? Wake Up!

851834243089145856 2017-04-11 16:28:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinamash @ASlavitt @CAPAction Yes but it was still WAY TO GOOD for Justin to vote for it-Don't be deceived!
851833430287503361 2017-04-11 16:24:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @FriendsofJimmys No reason to believe our govt is more corrupt thAn others. The difference is med costs controlled by govt.
851830381955383296 2017-04-11 16:12:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @ManikTyagi I agree but the healthcare lobbyists have bought & sold GOP (& some Dems) many times over, just ask Dr Price. American people must demand it
851829804332720128 2017-04-11 16:10:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @ManikTyagi Yea that sucks, but single payer would fix that "competition" will not.
851829436114771968 2017-04-11 16:08:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @ManikTyagi Competition does not work in healthcare-why every other civilized country has single payer
851829256569147393 2017-04-11 16:08:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @ManikTyagi No single payer with set fees would bring costs down
851828992604852224 2017-04-11 16:07:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @ManikTyagi Well ok but there has to be some kind of insurance or payer system.

851827473478287362 2017-04-11 16:01:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @American3333 I'm guessing my schooling exceeds yours-look at every other civilized nation-why compare to communist/dictator Cuba?
851826569714782209 2017-04-11 15:57:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @FriendsofJimmys Because they have single payer systems!!!
851826290349002752 2017-04-11 15:56:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @TheChappedHide Why is it republicans always tell folks to leave if they don't like it-that's really UnAmerican. Maybe you folks should move to Russia.
851824971299028993 2017-04-11 15:51:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @2theLeff It's "good" for every other civilized nation in the world (so that's pretty good).
851824452702744577 2017-04-11 15:49:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @PiperCutch A lot of people are fighting to keep that Medicare-hVe you seen any offering to give it up?
851824120425840641 2017-04-11 15:47:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @American3333 Ask EVERY other Civiluzed nation in the world-they all have some form of single payer healthcare (why ask Cuba-that's dumb)
851823621043630081 2017-04-11 15:45:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @ManikTyagi Free market has not worked in healthcare, that's how we've ended up with most expensive healthcare in the world. GOP INDEBTED to $$$
851820866061119488 2017-04-11 15:34:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix I will NEVER trust them. They've shown their true colors. Ineptitude is bad enough and then put collusion on top of that-nope, I'm Done.
851820038826979328 2017-04-11 15:31:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @BarackObama This says it all about the GOP, this is why our country is in such peril. We must get rid of McConnell, Ryan, Freedon Caucus.
851817856471896064 2017-04-11 15:22:57 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidYankovich This sucks but please take part in #TaxMarch #IndComm #MarchForTruth this Saturday 4-15 USA I'm still energized by Women's March-it HELPS!
851810817628614656 2017-04-11 14:54:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @deplorables2016 No Ivanka wanna be-you're the one who looks like a fool.

851792500767510528 2017-04-11 13:42:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @danpfeiffer Your POD friends WILL be working hard to get  rid of McConnell next time around-he's a big part of why USA is in such dire straights now.
851789228916842499 2017-04-11 13:29:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @BraddJaffy It sure didn't for me, in fact, it did just the opposite.
851781362067570688 2017-04-11 12:57:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell Eric is full of BS (like daddy) the minute I heard of the missiles I totally assumed it was a SCAM. Syrian babies mean 0 to #45 #TrumpRussia
851779314869817344 2017-04-11 12:49:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @foxnation Omg only Fake 45 would ever post Fox Fake News story about Syrians naming their sons after him. International Disgrace and Embarrassment.

851610479130791936 2017-04-10 01:38:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @steelworkers @TomPerez @BigWyo626 Why would you say that?
851609650965467136 2017-04-10 01:35:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @steelworkers @TomPerez @BigWyo626 Most people get paid the absolute least amount of $ the company thinks they can pay and keep employees and not a penny more.
851608343676416001 2017-04-10 01:30:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @steelworkers @TomPerez @BigWyo626 Yea that doesn't make sense
851606994570051585 2017-04-10 01:25:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP @AdamSerwer Gotta love Alabama, it makes even Kentucky look good.
851606584358842368 2017-04-10 01:23:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @TheRickWilson Really and she's cute too! Gross
851605998548791296 2017-04-10 01:21:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @steelworkers @TomPerez @BigWyo626 If not mandatory, folks don't financially help support union but benefit by representation anyway Right to work=Right to work for less
851602153315717121 2017-04-10 01:05:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @20committee Bad for a butcher?

851596290781851648 2017-04-10 00:42:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidYankovich @nytgraphics This is off the charts- I guess we can think of it as somehow positive as he's not tweeting some ridiculous thing while he's playing golf.
851594939326758912 2017-04-10 00:37:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonfavs @DanteAtkins Lol now that's a good one.
851594625362087937 2017-04-10 00:35:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @steelworkers @TomPerez Hopefully folks at the UAW are beginning to realize trump used them in a big way. Like he gives a crap about union workers.
851592981140393985 2017-04-10 00:29:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones A Hole.
851590484170616833 2017-04-10 00:19:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @USARedOrchestra That's a sad truth that seems to be easily overlooked by quite a few people.
851580337276809217 2017-04-10 23:39:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @watzgoinonhere @ChrisCuomo Sorry Chris, I agree with Just Cheryl
851579974364655616 2017-04-10 23:37:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @ChrisCuomo @carolmoson They have talked about it and it's a non story-she was doing her job.
851573288207822848 2017-04-10 23:11:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump So Gross a stolen seat in Supreme Court made by a president who stole the presidency (this stuff is as fake as Donnie's hair and skin color)
851563995249213442 2017-04-10 22:34:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @CharlesMBlow A. Lot. More. To. Go.
851560217112399873 2017-04-10 22:19:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @Bakari_Sellers @KristenClarkeJD Yea we pretty much knew that at "Texas"
851553150683295747 2017-04-10 21:51:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @Fahrenthold Well done you earned it-Enjoy!
851552497017786369 2017-04-10 21:48:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @DavidYankovich I've heard Bannon via rich/crazy Mercer
851551101279141888 2017-04-10 21:42:58 UTC <HenslerKate> @RedwoodGirl @philwillon Well they just need to get trump to take care of that!
851537559046025216 2017-04-10 20:49:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @davebernstein @StevenTDennis Careful if he sees this he'll probably do it again.

851484178969489410 2017-04-10 17:17:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @TIME Well isn't that nice, White men & their women clinging to their version of reality.
851482290358296578 2017-04-10 17:09:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @KMR724 @CHURCHLADY320 Of course that was deceived ;)
851461893130780674 2017-04-10 15:48:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @MaxineWaters @NolefanpaG @trumpscarnage Hopefully you'll be going back to a Dem. I like Jennifer.

851418201737056257 2017-04-10 12:54:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @KMR724 @CHURCHLADY320 You must be right, I was conceived by her although I certainly didn't vote for her. She's a wolf in sheeps clothing.
851416760322588672 2017-04-10 12:49:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Because he's known for "handling situations" PROPERLY.
851415827622612993 2017-04-10 12:45:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Do you feel good about stealing his bench?Of course, you stole your presidency too so probably you do. You're a pitiful excuse for president
851272387676913665 2017-04-09 03:15:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP He is a Total Disaster.
851268628200603648 2017-04-09 03:00:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @Alyssa_Milano Perfect name for her, she's beautiful.
851252417689735169 2017-04-09 01:56:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @RBReich Absolutely, he's the lowest of the low, when trump is exposed, McConnell will be held accountable & KY will vote him out for good!
851233399591362561 2017-04-09 00:40:32 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillMoyersHQ @AriBerman @Chankobun Well then you could be right, I've never heard that definition. But they sure are hanging onto power, despite all of the negative influence.
851106083003392000 2017-04-09 16:14:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @CindyHargest @sassyvixen93 Ok sorry missed the eye roll!
851105283803893761 2017-04-09 16:11:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @TheRickWilson @sassyvixen93 @CindyHargest Umm no, these are very rich and very dishonest old men who have had a lifetime of getting exactly what they want-that's not 8th grade girls.
851104590674227202 2017-04-09 16:08:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @TheRickWilson Well trump was right about Marco, he is "little".
851103052249669632 2017-04-09 16:02:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @jonathanchait @NormEisen And his idiot twin trump
851102601848524802 2017-04-09 16:00:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @BillMoyersHQ @AriBerman And they called him a bigot? And now he is the F ing AG of the USA. Totally Wrong on every level. What part of this is "CONSERVATIVE"?
851101502546620416 2017-04-09 15:56:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland @ItsRigged2016 What do you mean, they have a situation room.  Can you even imagine if BHO had done that. Senate would be investigating non stop.
851100596115582976 2017-04-09 15:52:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @ericgarland Especially when it's an apparent complete about face by an emotionally labile narcissist who colluded with Russia to steal presidency.
851099897382264832 2017-04-09 15:50:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Lol Policy! 
851099656247541762 2017-04-09 15:49:05 UTC <HenslerKate> I'll never understand why anyone would choose to listen to such a hateful and dishonest person-She's a true Nasty Woman.
851098632476602369 2017-04-09 15:45:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee Fake News
851096303945822208 2017-04-09 15:35:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @POTUS @sethmoulton @FoxNews Yea because no successful Fortune 500 Co has a plan, it's just Helter Skelter maybe something good will happen.
851086715846635520 2017-04-09 14:57:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior @Burntsmurff Didn't James Baker SOS under GH Bush & Conde Rice vouch for Tillerson? Wonder how much they stand to make? D.C. Is a cesspool. Bigly Bad $$$

851074053993631744 2017-04-09 14:07:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @tenax666 @sarahkendzior Fake outrage presented so that lifting sanctions can somehow be justified later-Never trust these people, they lie constantly & r about $$$
851073020366114817 2017-04-09 14:03:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou McConnell is such a scumbag, making him take his own medicine is going to be such sweet justice. He deserves every ounce of it.
851072186014208000 2017-04-09 13:59:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones Because why should Flint be the only one to deal with High levels of lead (what doesn't kill you makes you stronger)?
851045304493330432 2017-04-09 12:13:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @FBI @LouiseMensch Read it, perfect sense. The minute We bombed them, I knew. You'd have to be pretty dense to believe it was about the "babies"
850919501197709313 2017-04-08 03:53:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid @yashar Yes, it sounds like he's perfectly awful. Hopefully McMaster will win that one! What the hell is Gorka doing there, but also Bannon/Miller?
850892040992956416 2017-04-08 02:04:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @KeithOlbermann @Alaanqaa Prison would be more appropriate.
850891683218808832 2017-04-08 02:02:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @KeithOlbermann @DonaldtheFraud WTF? WRONG ON EVERY LEVEL.
850891345975799808 2017-04-08 02:01:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @KeithOlbermann No but it's only right! Stealing an ejection by colluding with Russia demands a do-over. No hand offs . Let's nominate Adam Schiff/FrankenVP
850867759957331968 2017-04-08 00:27:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders @Brysbabydoll I know I read about it-totally sick! I can't quite come to terms with so many "good Christians" being pro death penalty. Doesn't make sense.

850851182180433920 2017-04-08 23:21:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenSanders WTF US, pro gun, pro death penalty, anti single payer insurance, anti choice, cutting fund ArtWhat part of "civilized" does that represent?

850806226418118657 2017-04-08 20:23:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytimes I feel exactly the same way.America is under siege folks and McConnell/Ryan think they can manage the situation-they're no match for Putin.

849967859673575424 2017-04-06 12:51:44 UTC <HenslerKate> @sarahkendzior Yea just flying under the radar, don't count that maniac out.
849966968295890944 2017-04-06 12:48:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix Well I'd like to think it had some effect, but really I think it was good old Jared, now known as President Jared (First Jewish President)
849964721449160705 2017-04-06 12:39:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @TomthunkitsMind Trump has always been a buffoon, how could anybody say we weren't prepared. Maybe next the Rs can elect Howard Stern, wouldn't that be fun!
849963960073953280 2017-04-06 12:36:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @DemResistance @TomthunkitsMind Shumer would go for universal health program
849960050877771776 2017-04-06 12:20:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @Oust_Democrats You're delusional
849959893213773825 2017-04-06 12:20:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost @Oust_Democrats Yes I'm looking forward to-increase in pollution and use of more toxic chemicals on my grand children. Oh & decreasing taxes on mega rich 
849958562294104068 2017-04-06 12:14:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost He's a total lying idiot, plain for all to see. One has to really question the intelligence and judgement of those who voted for him.
849958008780189696 2017-04-06 12:12:35 UTC <HenslerKate> It kills me, smart (really) people say "we need moral leadership" from trump. Just because you want it, and it should be, DOESN'T make it so
849957114646863872 2017-04-06 12:09:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @RWPUSA But as long as these unscrupulous Republicans are in power, they won't! Are you a Repub Mr Painter?
849952022489165824 2017-04-06 11:48:48 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC You are a DOLT, investigating S Rice is as imp as #TrumpRussia, just can't let the GOP crap go, can you? #TrumpRussia is everything!
849946062328614913 2017-04-06 11:25:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC You always revert to giving trump way too much credit,  very slow learner! Wake Up, Stay Woke.
849945573247647744 2017-04-06 11:23:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Don't compare trump's admin to clinton's, some disorganization by a smart and capable man does not compare to this idiot's shit show
849841749996470272 2017-04-05 04:30:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @McFaul Still crickets to Russia though, hmmm?
849840902680043522 2017-04-05 04:27:15 UTC <HenslerKate> The problem with trump is not that he "speaks his mind" but what those words tell us about his mind.
849839958319915008 2017-04-05 04:23:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Trashy trump strikes again!

849816238931013632 2017-04-05 02:49:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @signinwcasting And by "borrowed" you mean "plagerized" right? So disgusting from a potential Supreme Court justice-So Shameful.
849808297855246340 2017-04-05 02:17:41 UTC <HenslerKate> @KeithSchiller45 @MaddowBlog @kenvogel Can this shit show be any less professional? Nice that our national security is in such capable hands-spoiler alert-this doesn't end well.
849804921427955712 2017-04-05 02:04:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix @Mikel_Jollett So not surprised, his gee whiz fellas approach of sacchariny sweet suck up syrup didn't convince me for a minute-nobody is that wholesome.
849803486606872577 2017-04-05 01:58:34 UTC <HenslerKate> That will be some serious poetic justice and it can't come too soon.

849722724461268993 2017-04-05 20:37:39 UTC <HenslerKate> They don't call it the party of "no" for nothing. He's a poster child for how to go Authoritarian. #IndComm #MarchForTruth #TaxMarch 4-15

849619694961209344 2017-04-05 13:48:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @TomthunkitsMind But, but, but, We have the best medical care in the world! Just one more GOP LIE tells and people choose to believe! Americans WAKE UP!
849618998224461828 2017-04-05 13:45:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @PoliticusSarah @dancingfun I guess you missed the whole Ailes thing, Fox fake news is fine with that behavior, in fact, they're founded on it.
849618592782065666 2017-04-05 13:43:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @PoliticusSarah Grab you wallet or old man O'Reilly will grab your p***y!

849617101841158145 2017-04-05 13:37:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @USARedOrchestra Trump has the ethics of an alley cat and the maturity of a 10 year old, who's emotionally immature.
849616714073505792 2017-04-05 13:36:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @milesjreed Total Crook!

849598793989464065 2017-04-05 12:25:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoeNBC Joe, most Americans knew trump would be this big of a disaster, you did not. Academics  are liberal because they're smart. U R NOT.

849429002733465602 2017-04-04 01:10:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw He wasn't sugar coating it, he knew what he was talking about-Red Flag # too numerous to count-#MarchForTruth 4-15 #TaxMarch #CoastCoast

849419656842661888 2017-04-04 00:33:22 UTC <HenslerKate> @washingtonpost Was it just yesterday that Tillerson said he was cool with whatever Assad did to his people? Guess he knew he had a green light for murder?
849416955496980482 2017-04-04 00:22:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @RepAdamSchiff @tribelaw Nunes will clearly cheat & lie every chance he gets, transparency is critical if we have any hope to save our democracy. We must demand it.
849414407125950464 2017-04-04 00:12:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @donlemon We need a lot more of this-he spoke the truth, finally someone did.
849413571515740160 2017-04-04 00:09:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @josephamodeo It means we now know what their next shiny object is-No surprise to me-it's right out of the F***ing playbook-nice way to siege power though
849347475970424832 2017-04-04 19:46:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @antonejohnson @PhysicalPolitik @Dumptrump1939 And also racism-since I'm the one saying all the controversial stuff-I personally see that as a big part of it.
849346726859350018 2017-04-04 19:43:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @antonejohnson @PhysicalPolitik @Dumptrump1939 Christianity specifically

849338052392738818 2017-04-04 19:09:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @antonejohnson I'm beginning to think "conservative" means something entirely different across the pond.

849299876257169408 2017-04-04 16:37:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @CHSommers @NearSlighted My point is, this country chose (although he got fewer votes) an idiot inexperienced man over a very smart  experienced woman. Misogyny!
849299057671639041 2017-04-04 16:34:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @CHSommers @NearSlighted And though claiming to be a registered democrat, I'm sure she hasn't voted that way in quite some time. Kind of like being a gay "patriot"
849298564916367361 2017-04-04 16:32:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @CHSommers @NearSlighted Wrong, no liberal or progressive would work there.
849296325418119168 2017-04-04 16:23:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @CHSommers @NearSlighted Maybe things are somewhat better across the pond, but really, the fact that idiot traitor trump is the US Pres should say it all.
849295779722387457 2017-04-04 16:21:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @CHSommers @NearSlighted Yes I did and at least I'll cop to it! What's your excuse, I love liberty, I mean guns, fake Marlboro man?

849291826657886209 2017-04-04 16:05:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @CHSommers @NearSlighted I would not call Academia and American Enterprise Institute, real world at all! It's silly to say that a liberal would work there, EVER!

849284212368822272 2017-04-04 15:35:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @CHSommers I read more about her, not Christian, Jewish (go figure) never got tenured despite being at second level schools, trust me, she's wrong.
849281650756382720 2017-04-04 15:24:59 UTC <HenslerKate> @CHSommers Yes I'm a woman and I've lived 54 years in the real world, trust me it's total bull, total! I'll bet she's a big Christian too-part of it!

849274114430947329 2017-04-04 14:55:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch @20committee We are totally ready John-thank you!!!
849273643498655745 2017-04-04 14:53:10 UTC <HenslerKate> @USARedOrchestra It's called making a deal with the devil, is anyone actually surprised by this?
849273378158641152 2017-04-04 14:52:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @carlhurdmba @jimmyhawk9 Looks like we made it!
849272805946515465 2017-04-04 14:49:50 UTC <HenslerKate> @Cernovich "Right wing thinkers" lol that's pretty funny
849272578514538496 2017-04-04 14:48:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @Cernovich You are truly a despicable human being-I hope you go down with trumptanic (you certainly deserve it)
849271218582822912 2017-04-04 14:43:31 UTC <HenslerKate> Such a ridiculous statement but alas completely predictable, COMPLETELY!
849270368879693824 2017-04-04 14:40:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @peterdaou Heard this last night, he said it with a lot of conviction, more people must join him, letting trump distract is a loss for us all.
849269103156219908 2017-04-04 14:35:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @JoyAnnReid Yes and it still is although it does look like they're working on trying to make it worse-GOP (GREED OVER PEOPLE)
849268422961750018 2017-04-04 14:32:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @maggieNYT @NYTMetro He is a crazy old crook!
849267783036792832 2017-04-04 14:29:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @gregpmiller @McFaul Well to be fair Michael, if they'd been paying you billions of dollars, you probably would have!
849266904179109888 2017-04-04 14:26:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @gregpmiller @weddady Oh my god this is so terrible.
849265532834631681 2017-04-04 14:20:56 UTC <HenslerKate> @summerbrennan I'm sure, well hopefully eventually you'll be justly rewarded- you deserve that.

849262073859231744 2017-04-04 14:07:11 UTC <HenslerKate> @summerbrennan All in a days work-Pretty cool stuff! Too bad you'll only earn 79% of what a man would earn for doing it! Ivanka's working on that though 
849261355504893952 2017-04-04 14:04:20 UTC <HenslerKate> @yoginidharma @MotherJones @BeaKinde They're crooks Alt Right, but they certainly aren't newly corrupt.
849261141389869056 2017-04-04 14:03:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones @JetMech72 Petty bullshit?, colluding with Russia-your comment is ridiculous. Glad you're part of the crazy corrupt Alt Right-stay there.
849260361865986048 2017-04-04 14:00:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones Ummm does anyone else's gaydar go off with Price and Pence? Because mine is really going crazy here.
849259875905437696 2017-04-04 13:58:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @greta We've "given you a chance" no thanks, I guess you weren't hot enough for Fox Fake News?
849259283405578242 2017-04-04 13:56:06 UTC <HenslerKate> @greta Yes you're all for Ivanka talking about equal pay, ridiculous you have no concerns about nepotism-I hope MSNBC fires you-you suck!!!
849258638665502721 2017-04-04 13:53:32 UTC <HenslerKate> Rand's going pretty cheap these days, isn't he?
849258261148835840 2017-04-04 13:52:02 UTC <HenslerKate> @ashleyfeinberg No surprise, but no "Putin for world leader" follow?
849257704535281665 2017-04-04 13:49:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @watzgoinonhere @JWGOP We will not be distracted despite their best efforts-#TrumpRussia must remain primary focus (we have a traitor as president) he must go.
849256894569086980 2017-04-04 13:46:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @nytimes The worst part is that I would actually be surprised if this weren't true-I mean the females on Fox wear cocktail dresses to deliver  "NEWS"
849255632280702976 2017-04-04 13:41:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @fordm Well said, they're all hypocrites.
849254609508077569 2017-04-04 13:37:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @rafsanchez Great job trump/tillerson, nice of you to support this butcher but then you're also fond of putin so no big deal, right?
849252611802923008 2017-04-04 13:29:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @MSNBC @SRuhle @greta "It was in the house that bill fell apart". Wrong. Trump was clueless & tried to bully it through. I've tried watching you-No Thanks again
849243183087308801 2017-04-04 12:52:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @DrRandPaul Well now we know what you paid for playing golf at Mar-a-Lago, the last bit of integrity left in you-Disgusting

849020623645016064 2017-04-03 22:07:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @RandPaul Smoking gun found up your butt after colluding with trump on golf course-you're the worst Rand, well maybe second to McConnell
849015920156659716 2017-04-03 21:49:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @20committee Well if we're honest, we'd have to say this is just one of many similarities that we now share with the Kremlin. Thanks Rs, we won't forget.

849010875256197120 2017-04-03 21:29:01 UTC <HenslerKate> Gross just saw Gorsuch commercial, says to let your senator know to confirm him, as if McConnell or Paul have taken a call for months.

842338549982724098 2017-03-16 11:35:34 UTC <HenslerKate> @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan "we made a promise" (to take from the poor & give to the rich) & we know ACA is not failing-just more GOP LIES!!!

842327923432534019 2017-03-16 10:53:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump #DonTheCon if you were trying to "walk back" your false accusation of #44, it was an epic fail!
842223902914945024 2017-03-15 04:00:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @spectatorindex @AndreaChalupa Yea, they're not going to find themselves with a crazy #DonTheCon type. They learned from USA's mistake!
842223306073870336 2017-03-15 03:57:38 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw What a pitiful excuse for a doctor! Almost as good as #DonTheCon's crazy Dr. Goldstein!

842006124383637505 2017-03-15 13:34:38 UTC <HenslerKate> Does anyone believe the Repugs when they say "easiest thing would be to let ACA die" bc if it was a real option, they'd sure as hell do it!

841999268613357571 2017-03-15 13:07:23 UTC <HenslerKate> Yea #donthecon released the 2005 tax returns-it's pretty obvious-just look at what he said about them, even before the show!
841997755157512192 2017-03-15 13:01:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @LouiseMensch I guess they muzzled him after the "Ban/No ban thing"
841997307637841920 2017-03-15 12:59:36 UTC <HenslerKate> Let me just say, I don't trust Director Comey, not after what he pulled with HRC (all of a sudden he has "standards"-interesting)
841996417757507586 2017-03-15 12:56:04 UTC <HenslerKate> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump Only Fox folks haven't heard of him #donthecon !!!
841996043956940800 2017-03-15 12:54:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump You're sick #donthecon maybe you can get help after they lock you up!
841995763534180352 2017-03-15 12:53:28 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Better for CEO Much worse for everybody else! You've totally betrayed your base #donthecon

841994602123038720 2017-03-15 12:48:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix This might be the one & only thing I agree with Joe on-he supports #donthecon far too often for me!!!
841994166083178496 2017-03-15 12:47:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @SteveScalise Omg we don't believe your "death spiral" & neither do you or you'd let it die obviously! You & #donthecon so many damn lies!!
841992146353823744 2017-03-15 12:39:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen @tampagirl19655 Guess you didn't deal with the Russians?
841991924441587712 2017-03-15 12:38:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen @NcognitoStar So True!
841991814332719104 2017-03-15 12:37:46 UTC <HenslerKate> @NormEisen Not worth the value of the paper it's printed on! Nothing!!!

841990427892957185 2017-03-15 12:32:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @Second_Man_Down You were right the first time, "Its always $$$"!

841988444863750145 2017-03-15 12:24:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC Does being at all honest completely negate possibility of being Repub-#donthecon worst thing ever for Repubs!!!
841987914028400640 2017-03-15 12:22:16 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @rancher_texas Do you consider having any moral fiber a disqualifier for Repubs-I get that if you're for #donthecon
841987265765249025 2017-03-15 12:19:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow @LindseyGrahamSC @halsell00 trump did that-wake up already !
841987148848885761 2017-03-15 12:19:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @julietells He's one a few willing to be honest and you accuse him of wrong doing? Why wouldn't you want the truth?
841986769797169152 2017-03-15 12:17:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @SenWarren @LindseyGrahamSC He's one of the few in your party with any moral fiber and you want him out-Strange!
841986441051795456 2017-03-15 12:16:25 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @JamieSmock I don't agree with his politics but at least he's willing to be somewhat honest-makes him a real standout sadly
841985812279513088 2017-03-15 12:13:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @RickyMills20 Sorry wrong-that's Fox, Breitbart, Drudge, Daily Caller, Limbaugh, Coulter, etc all cheap FAKE NEWS!!!
841984528633733120 2017-03-15 12:08:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC @tbdriver4752 If by that you mean he has at least SOME moral fiber then yes he must be a Dem!
841984216082571264 2017-03-15 12:07:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @LindseyGrahamSC Senator PLEASE stand up for an INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE You OBVIOUSLY know it's warranted, PLEASE For our DEMOCRACY!!!
841983535602913280 2017-03-15 12:04:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump Yes Many (majority) believe it Absolutely we do #donthecon Yes we do because you are a pathological LAIR!!!
841860722686623745 2017-03-14 03:56:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @MrGoalie35 @MalcolmNance @KatyTurNBC I've been wondering the same thing-they sit there and say nothing which is odd bc it's NOT TRUE!
841846331178123264 2017-03-14 02:59:40 UTC <HenslerKate> @Trump_Regrets Research actually indicates the more u  persuade the more convinced they become So good luck with that approach!
841845810635673600 2017-03-14 02:57:36 UTC <HenslerKate> @Trump_Regrets You are just far too serious for twitter but, well that's it! You will convince  no one including me.
841844185942626304 2017-03-14 02:51:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @Trump_Regrets I didn't "yell" at anyone and I did not fall for this either, sorry if you did!
841843800809054208 2017-03-14 02:49:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @Trump_Regrets I typically ignore these regrets but I also question if many are real-I find 1/2 sober suspicious-this is twitter
841842082872492035 2017-03-14 02:42:47 UTC <HenslerKate> @Trump_Regrets Ok I really don't know what you're talking about "Putin's game"?
841841130127912960 2017-03-14 02:39:00 UTC <HenslerKate> @Trump_Regrets I'm Not interested in being friends with a trump voter who identifies him/her self as "half sober" go right ahead
841838919532580868 2017-03-14 02:30:13 UTC <HenslerKate> @BrookingsGov @CNN @donlemon @NormEisen I'll be watching, heard you on Pod Save America, Great Stuff!
841837413223784449 2017-03-14 02:24:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @Trump_Regrets @halfsober I didn't say much, deal with it if you don't like it (it could have been worse)
841834480004415488 2017-03-14 02:12:35 UTC <HenslerKate> @tribelaw @NormEisen Don't think it will be necessary but if so, they'll be in VERY CAPABLE hands!
841832791474077696 2017-03-14 02:05:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @halfsober @Trump_Regrets @realDonaldTrump Total fraud are you just figuring this out? Maybe the half sober thing explains that
841831531832332290 2017-03-14 02:00:52 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @DemResistance This is utterly ridiculous. So flat out wrong!
841820590478630912 2017-03-14 01:17:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @WSJ @JasonMillerinDC You're nasty and you lie almost as much as #donthecon
841761005956923392 2017-03-14 21:20:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @JYSexton No shock there it suits about 90% of their base!
841760417374457857 2017-03-14 21:18:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @ItizBiz Snowflake (call her snowie) :)
841741848578297856 2017-03-14 20:04:30 UTC <HenslerKate> @justinhendrix Yea ok sure you mean the king of fertilizer? Gonna call BULLSHIT on that one!
841741320527990787 2017-03-14 20:02:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @paladine Sure have, not sure how those all jive but they sure do!
841736821713321985 2017-03-14 19:44:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Really could you be more out of touch #donthecon?
841682875787444226 2017-03-14 16:10:09 UTC <HenslerKate> @SPEAKUPJULIA @DemResistance Painfully true!
841682237879926784 2017-03-14 16:07:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @alexburnsNYT @maggieNYT @ChrisRuddyNMX Yes this would be great good luck getting the Repugs to agree to that!
841658272763510785 2017-03-14 14:32:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @uscapitol @visitthecapitol @SpeakerRyan Poor poor Paul made a deal with Judas and he sold you out Bannon NOT your friend Breitbart either!
841657390265204736 2017-03-14 14:28:53 UTC <HenslerKate> @SteveKingIA @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi Oh didn't you hear he didn't mean it the way it sounded
841628151293837312 2017-03-14 12:32:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @nokidhungry @Hortons_Kids @HomesForOurTrps @PressSec @POTUS @jaketapper yea right I'm sure they'll get right on that
841627183646965760 2017-03-14 12:28:51 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan We don't trust you any more that we trust #donthecon-Lay down with dogs, wake up with fleas!
841626050517962752 2017-03-14 12:24:21 UTC <HenslerKate> @DenbrotS Wonder what their next excuse will be-they're so pathetic!
841621292923117569 2017-03-14 12:05:27 UTC <HenslerKate> @cb_beach_bum @Trump_Regrets @realDonaldTrump He never wanted to "fix" it. None of us should trust #donthecon He's all about the rich :(
841620734082465792 2017-03-14 12:03:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @paulkrugman By "amazing" I guess you mean "sick" #donthecon lies as easily as he breaths
841618674901483520 2017-03-14 11:55:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan It's not collapsing despite your efforts to make that happen, Good Catholic man taking from poor and giving to the rich-NASTY!
841617091723685891 2017-03-14 11:48:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @JoyAnnReid Of course he lied and said replace would be cheaper & better-DETAILS don't mean too much to #donthecon!
841616433587073025 2017-03-14 11:46:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @TeaPainUSA How about Ryan acting like it's a GREAT plan-got his tax cut in for the rich-gotta have that Paul you swine!

837071250610540547 2017-03-01 22:45:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Yea really must be a bot-pro Russia and pro guns nice-so much for patriotism and Your do called love !

837066771752488960 2017-03-01 22:27:24 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Then his comment that Ryan is happy in heaven bc he got a big round of applause-sullying him sadly.
837066478226657280 2017-03-01 22:26:15 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Of course I felt terrible for Mrs Owen-it's tragic. Made worse by comments & exploitation by trump.
837066169781714946 2017-03-01 22:25:01 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Is that a YES for guns? I don't know what politicized alien speech you refer to.
837053561812942857 2017-03-01 21:34:55 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Just a guess here but I bet you're very fond of 2nd amendment rights? You know Guns, guns, guns?
837053254802501635 2017-03-01 21:33:42 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump I did not watch trump,I find him revolting-no response to his crass comments yesterday-hard to defend?
837041072375218178 2017-03-01 20:45:17 UTC <HenslerKate> @VanJones68 @DemResistance Yes I was surprised Van said this Katy Tur as well-totally disagree on that
837038103030337536 2017-03-01 20:33:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump @DemResistance Interesting Muslim name gets a conclusion in 2 minutes flat from WH
837024442408710144 2017-03-01 19:39:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump On that note what about trump's disrespect of Ryan's family yesterday-blaming his death on Obama/Generals?
837009061082198016 2017-03-01 18:38:05 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Clearly "nuance" is not your thing but nobody said I don't support them-well except you!
836995248119230464 2017-03-01 17:43:12 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump We don't detest them, we just don't engage in mindless idolatry of them. Contrary to  you-not black/white
836983493225754624 2017-03-01 16:56:29 UTC <HenslerKate> @realDonaldTrump Ha yea good luck with that one :)
836973587881918464 2017-03-01 16:17:08 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN Also known as rational response
836953434284822528 2017-03-01 14:57:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN I would suggest they responded to trump's obvious exploitation of a woman whose husband he casually sent to his death!
836937520369786881 2017-03-01 13:53:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @KatyTurNBC @ellensilver3 Wow well if by "extraordinary" you really mean "exploitive" I'm with you!
836937144497287168 2017-03-01 13:52:19 UTC <HenslerKate> @imillhiser @davebernstein @owillis EXACTLY-because he can read a speech that someone else wrote he's not the total loser we all  see?
836935483993251841 2017-03-01 13:45:43 UTC <HenslerKate> @LOLGOP @ishaantharoor @InSpiteOfTrump Guess we know why trump won't acknowledge anything but "Muslim terrorists" I knew it was bad but WOW!

836931465858396160 2017-03-01 13:29:45 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN You must be a bot with your totally predictable comments & your old home coming queen picture

836928317420879872 2017-03-01 13:17:14 UTC <HenslerKate> @samsteinhp @Muthawalker Really repulsed is the word-first he deflects blame onto his generals, then he parades her out for applause-Gross!
836927612773613570 2017-03-01 13:14:26 UTC <HenslerKate> @samsteinhp Oh, you mean his obvious exploitation of the woman whose husband he carelessly let die? Yea that made me sick-typical trump!

836800552600227841 2017-02-28 04:49:33 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNN @leslieshawNC She was trying to be charitable but you're to stupid to know it! I prefer to think of trumpsters as evil or ignorant

836764693591117825 2017-02-28 02:27:03 UTC <HenslerKate> @SpeakerRyan Just wondering, did it hurt to have your ass that far up trump's ass?
836752501592449026 2017-02-28 01:38:37 UTC <HenslerKate> @VanJones68 Careful folks he'll try to deport you with the Mexicans!

835964864787001350 2017-02-26 21:28:49 UTC <HenslerKate> @MotherJones Why don't we just split the county in 2 and give 1/2 to Repubs & they can shoot one another and arrest the rest!
835963779007528960 2017-02-26 21:24:31 UTC <HenslerKate> @CNNPolitics @FWhitfield @JackKingston Polls were off by 1% point-you're words are worthless-you can run but you can't hide!

835898250406346754 2017-02-26 17:04:07 UTC <HenslerKate> @khakisalmon @Khanoisseur It's trump's own personal basket of deplorables-DON THE CON!

835160453907107840 2017-02-24 16:12:23 UTC <HenslerKate> @Millermena @LouiseMensch Yea, Shit's getting deep.
835149439459344389 2017-02-24 15:28:37 UTC <HenslerKate> When the POTUS starts his run on phrases with "to tell you the truth" and ends them with "believe me" we've got a problem folks.
