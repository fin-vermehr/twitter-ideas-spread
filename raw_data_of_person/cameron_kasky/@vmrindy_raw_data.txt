I haven't agreed with several sexiest men alive but, this is taking it a bit to far. Maybe Trump's meanness & rudeness has rubbed off on some. Also, every woman I know thinks Blake's sexy.

880574752112467969 2017-06-29 23:52:35 UTC <vmrindy> Did Kendall and Kylie get permission from any of the artists? As trademark happy as that family is, they had 2 know they needed permission.

880565782379245568 2017-06-29 23:16:57 UTC <vmrindy> @kylegriffin1 Whatever. Tired of hearing Repubs say they r embarrassed or don't agree w/what Trump says & does only to turn around & support his policies.
880533986237337601 2017-06-29 21:10:36 UTC <vmrindy> Why hasn't Twitter suspended @realDonaldTrump account for abusive behavior and targeted harassment?
877166313499758592 2017-06-20 14:08:40 UTC <vmrindy> @IronStache @timjhogan I want to move to Wisconsin just to vote for him.

876949548597489664 2017-06-19 23:47:19 UTC <vmrindy> Thank you Democrats 4 holding the floor. Every citizen, democrat or republican, has a right to see this before it's voted on. #HoldTheFloor
876548669373370370 2017-06-18 21:14:22 UTC <vmrindy> @Millennial_Dems He also said Comey didn't respect attorney/client privilege. Comey was neither Trump's attorney or client. Hope he's lead attorney at trial
876485914989559808 2017-06-18 17:05:01 UTC <vmrindy> Chris Wallace owned Jay Sekulow & he did it be using his own words against him. Sekulow literally lied about things he said seconds earlier.
876212370971996160 2017-06-17 22:58:03 UTC <vmrindy> I hope all his victims sue & leave him penniless. Let's see how much Camille Cosby supports him when he's broke. #ClassicEnabler
876114677893406720 2017-06-17 16:29:51 UTC <vmrindy> @CBSNews Any "power" Cosby had is gone. He has been exposed as a sexual predator. His victims took their power back when they came forward.
876108053002805248 2017-06-17 16:03:31 UTC <vmrindy> @KamalaHarris Pre-civil rights is when Trump thought America was at its greatest. Crystal clear what he means when he says "Make America Great Again" SMH
876104392658886658 2017-06-17 15:48:59 UTC <vmrindy> @RareSadPepe It's a sad day in America when a 500 yr old play upsets u but not a president who mocked the disabled & bragged about his sexual assaults.
876090452684021760 2017-06-17 14:53:35 UTC <vmrindy> Did she rush the stage when "Obama" was featured or when Trump said 2nd amend folks would handle Hillary? Thought not #hypocrite #FreeLaura

875718106987065344 2017-06-16 14:14:01 UTC <vmrindy> Now he's saying Mueller told him to fire Comey??? He's trying to undermine Mueller's credibility. He's so predictable and scared to death.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/875701471999864833

873346600063700993 2017-06-09 01:10:30 UTC <vmrindy> Trumps idea of testifying under oath would b his lawyer typing a statement and notarizing it. #TrumpMustTestify
873344887198015493 2017-06-09 01:03:41 UTC <vmrindy> His handlers/enablers r just arrogant enough to let him do it. They know his supporters won't care if he lies under oath. #TrumpMustTestify
873318492996501504 2017-06-09 23:18:48 UTC <vmrindy> @realDonaldTrump I agree. We should start by impeaching & prosecuting you and your treasonous enablers.

807335685854216192 2016-12-09 21:26:41 UTC <vmrindy> @danmericaCNN This is so offensive I don't even know where to start. Ignorance & stereotyping is to be expected from anything Trump related.
807331767153807360 2016-12-09 21:11:07 UTC <vmrindy> @ShaunKing Why would these idiots cover there faces and not there license plates?
805913043863564288 2016-12-05 23:13:37 UTC <vmrindy> @TheWalkingDead Nope. Carl is young, dumb, and reckless. Rick is taking everything in and planning.

785171991808520192 2016-10-09 17:36:05 UTC <vmrindy> Republicans draw a line at Trump degrading women but not when he insults Muslims, Mexicans, African Americans & individuals w/disabilities?

780622792202911744 2016-09-26 04:19:11 UTC <vmrindy> Is @realDonaldTrump really blaming his poor performance on a faulty microphone? Unbelievable. #debatenight

779443703068827648 2016-09-23 22:13:54 UTC <vmrindy> @CNN Trump and his family are so far removed from reality it's scary. In what world is 1 million dollars "just about nothing"?
778874014991212544 2016-09-22 08:30:10 UTC <vmrindy> Since u think America's not a great country & want to "make it great again", exactly what year was America last great?  #AskTrumpOneQuestion
778713302712987648 2016-09-21 21:51:33 UTC <vmrindy> @JohnJHarwood This just amazes me. Trump lies about stuff that anybody look up. Not even gray areas, just straight up lies.
778699419495469056 2016-09-21 20:56:23 UTC <vmrindy> @CHARLOTTTESKING I may not agree with everything you say but have a right to say it just like everyone else

773650341376118784 2016-09-07 22:33:09 UTC <vmrindy> @CHARLOTTTESKING @HoYeahPeggy But "badass, classy" Miranda doesn't have a say in who and what she takes pictures with. Poor thing
773641035306053632 2016-09-07 21:56:11 UTC <vmrindy> @CNN I am always shocked at just how cruel we can be to one another.

772974541828075520 2016-09-05 01:47:46 UTC <vmrindy> @NBCPolitics @NBCNews This is downright ridiculous. HC coughed!! Stop the presses!! This has got to be a joke. SMDH

771170657291767808 2016-08-31 02:19:47 UTC <vmrindy> Watching this speech in disbelief. I am truly frightened that anybody would want such a hateful, delusional racist as POTUS  #TrumpEnMexico
771133888202543104 2016-08-31 23:53:40 UTC <vmrindy> @GreenDay @GooglePlayMusic Unfortunately no but I swear I listened to #AmericanIdiot CD everyday for a year straight. 1 of my fave CD's ever
771122609475821568 2016-08-31 23:08:51 UTC <vmrindy> He lied about talking about paying for the wall? Press will call it a softening or tweaking of the conversation, not a lie. #TrumpEnMexico
771118313472528384 2016-08-31 22:51:47 UTC <vmrindy> The press keeps calling Trump's changing policy on immigration a pivot,softening,tweaking. Call it what it is...a flip flop #TrumpEnMexico
771104000213004288 2016-08-31 21:54:54 UTC <vmrindy> @DaRealAmberRose I have no respect for @ThePerezHilton or anyone who makes a living saying such mean, nasty & hateful things about women.
771098078405287936 2016-08-31 21:31:22 UTC <vmrindy> People who really thought @realDonaldTrump could do anything he promised to do regarding immigration deserve to feel like idiots right now.
771054881880801280 2016-08-31 18:39:44 UTC <vmrindy> I usually don't care about award shows but @blakeshelton not being nominated for a single CMA award is ridiculous. #BlakeWasRobbed
770568744238190592 2016-08-30 10:27:59 UTC <vmrindy> I respect Jerry Rice opinion but respect Kaepernick's more. We can't stop until the flag truly embodies everything it's supposed to.
770411138420912128 2016-08-29 00:01:43 UTC <vmrindy> And u need to learn what some people of color go through at the hands of some racist cops. #empathy #nocluehttps://twitter.com/TonyStewart/status/770377330325909506

770404291592847360 2016-08-29 23:34:31 UTC <vmrindy> I have very strong opinions about some things 
770399272000892928 2016-08-29 23:14:34 UTC <vmrindy> So the flag represents freedom but according to Drew Brees u r unpatriotic if u peacefully exercise that right.
770356274605223936 2016-08-29 20:23:43 UTC <vmrindy> Blazing Saddles and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory are 2 of my all time favorite movies. #RIP Gene Wilder #comicgenius

770003803001225216 2016-08-28 21:03:07 UTC <vmrindy> @myanabelleleigh I didn't say white people should do anything 4 black people??? All any of us can do is try to treat each other decently.

766780114470174721 2016-08-19 23:33:20 UTC <vmrindy> I have a very open mind and heart which is why I don't stereotype a whole race like Trump did.
766778022850551809 2016-08-19 23:25:01 UTC <vmrindy> Thinks he'll get 95% of the African American vote after saying we're unemployed & living in poverty with our uneducated kids. Unbelievable
766762789289365504 2016-08-19 22:24:29 UTC <vmrindy> I did not think that I could be more disgusted & offended by @realDonaldTrump I was wrong. Unreal.https://twitter.com/RJasonCottrell/status/766756291117191168
766758964667166720 2016-08-19 22:09:17 UTC <vmrindy> @cnnbrk How about everything we have gained since our ancestors were freed. Are there even any black people in the room? SMDH
766753353862787072 2016-08-19 21:46:59 UTC <vmrindy> @CNN Now you suddenly care about the African American vote? Whatever. Next he'll bring out "his African American" to show how diverse he is.
766422482609811456 2016-08-18 23:52:13 UTC <vmrindy> @realDonaldTrump talking about he never lies How he can say that and not get struck down by lightning is beyond me.

759740660643540993 2016-07-31 13:21:03 UTC <vmrindy> Watching @realDonaldTrump flat out lie and talk in circles is just pitiful. He literally has no answers to anything.
759465569464705024 2016-07-30 19:07:56 UTC <vmrindy> @ThisWeekABC So hiring people to work for you is considered a sacrifice!?!? What a delusional idiot.

758746325877858306 2016-07-28 19:29:55 UTC <vmrindy> @blakeshelton @DebraMessing @gwenstefani Takes a big person to apologize & an even bigger 1 to accept it & move on. Class all the way around
758607031150477312 2016-07-28 10:16:25 UTC <vmrindy> Republicans being upset that actor Bradley Cooper is a Democrat shows just how out of touch with reality they are.

758390403271766016 2016-07-27 19:55:37 UTC <vmrindy> Just when you think Bill O'Reilly can't sink any lower, he does. How can one be so devoid of basic human decency and compassion?

755217822612021248 2016-07-18 01:48:54 UTC <vmrindy> @felicia23456 I find it hilarious her fans always called Blake a serial cheater but when she actually admits to being one she's "classy"

743542352044658688 2016-06-16 20:34:45 UTC <vmrindy> @NewYorkPhotoGal Yes. He put his life on the line for an unjust war and was a POW and raised a halfway decent daughter.
743539349359255552 2016-06-16 20:22:49 UTC <vmrindy> John McCain was one of the last remaining Republicans that I respected. After his comments today, he has lost most of my respect.

737082132254711808 2016-05-29 00:44:09 UTC <vmrindy> @greektrigirl I was being sarcastic..people bashing Gwen for moving on too soon is ridiculous.
737081805140987904 2016-05-29 00:42:51 UTC <vmrindy> No I agree with u women should b supporting her 4 leaving someone who miss treated her for yrs. Not bashing her new relationship.
737070143700762624 2016-05-29 23:56:31 UTC <vmrindy> Gwen found her strength & left a man who hurt her for yrs but who cares because she moved on "too fast" w/Blake. It's ridiculous.
