971856477702049794 2018-03-08 21:13:35 UTC <elizochs> Still a WIP, but if it weren't, this'd be my PitMad tweet. Can't wait to participate 4 real 1 day!  Released after centuries of imprisonment, Prisoner One ropes along an intergalactic thief to get revenge on the ex-lover who betrayed her all those years ago: the emperor himself.
971575824158781440 2018-03-07 02:38:22 UTC <elizochs> When writing important revelations and plot twists, keep an eye on your pacing! Too fast, and it will confuse people. Too slow, and people will get bored. Pacing is always important, but especially in moments like these. #amwriting #writingtips
971557841092972545 2018-03-07 01:26:54 UTC <elizochs> "The Teeth" by Salvatore Difalco (http://www.decompmagazine.com/theteeth.htm) I have to get my wisdom teeth pulled soon, so this story made me ANXIOUS as HELL. There were a few technical things I would've done differently, but still a really good #shortstory. #amreading
971547511440756736 2018-03-07 00:45:51 UTC <elizochs> Nothing more inspiring than watching new authors unbox their book for the first time 
971533249452396550 2018-03-07 23:49:11 UTC <elizochs> My first reaction when I saw Huffman High School trending was that it was another school shooting, and that thought was accurate. This shouldn't be the first thing people think of when they see schools on news and social media. Schools are for education, not dying. #GunControlNow
971200028629925889 2018-03-06 01:45:05 UTC <elizochs> Me: nahhh I don't have time to watch a 2-hour movie Also me: *watches an entire tv season in one sitting*
971179939176370176 2018-03-06 00:25:15 UTC <elizochs> Seriously though, @audiomachine is a gold mine for #writing inspiration, especially for fantasy, sci-fi, and thrillers. I swear I get 2 new story ideas per album lol. #amwriting
971070023480545280 2018-03-06 17:08:29 UTC <elizochs> Planning my experimental fiction project for a creative writing class, and I'm getting really excited! It'll take a while to put together (I need to write an "ancient" ritual and research notes, bind a book, and make a PowerPoint), but it's gonna be SO worth it!
971066305188106241 2018-03-06 16:53:43 UTC <elizochs> There is no universal formula for crafting a good story. Writing, like any art form, is highly subjective. If a lot of people have the same complaints about your writing, learn from them. But otherwise, trust yourself! #amwriting #writingtips #writing
971063686294065152 2018-03-06 16:43:18 UTC <elizochs> You know, for an English major, my reading retention skills are pretty lackluster...
970824939472408576 2018-03-05 00:54:37 UTC <elizochs> Professor: You dont need to use academic sources Me: According to BuzzFeed Unsolved...  #collegelife #englishmajor
970492980145590272 2018-03-04 02:55:32 UTC <elizochs> Poets,  How do you know if a poem is any good? Are there any rules? What should a poem do for its reader, ideally?  Sincerely, a curious (and confused) prose writer

969963386686631939 2018-03-03 15:51:07 UTC <elizochs> There's no such thing as "plot-driven vs. character-driven." Plot drives character development, and the character makes us care about the plot. A good story is driven by both. #amwriting #writingtips
969774266697871366 2018-03-02 03:19:37 UTC <elizochs> Okay, but why does every sci-fi TV show have a trial/courtroom episode? Does anyone actually LIKE those episodes?

969678157187084289 2018-03-02 20:57:43 UTC <elizochs> #Windmageddon is getting real out there 
969628935544860672 2018-03-02 17:42:07 UTC <elizochs> Struggling to find a good plot for your character? Think of the worst thing that could possibly happen to your character, then make it happen! Your plot, conflict, and character development will flow from there. #amwriting #writingtips #WritingPrompts
969607750199267328 2018-03-02 16:17:56 UTC <elizochs> Does anyone know of any Creative Writing MFA programs that offer assistanceships or tuition reimbursement? Especially ones that focus on or offer Fiction, Popular Fiction, Speculative Fiction, etc.
969372978147405825 2018-03-01 00:45:02 UTC <elizochs> 40 mph winds tomorrow... 
969345989239767040 2018-03-01 22:57:48 UTC <elizochs> Happy birthday @JensenAckles!! Eat lots of cake!
969343665960308737 2018-03-01 22:48:34 UTC <elizochs> "Is this a bad story idea?" Don't worry about it! Stories are so much more than ideas... they're writing style, character development, conflict, arc, emotion. Ace those, and even bad ideas can become great stories. #writingtips #amwriting
969244410272731138 2018-03-01 16:14:09 UTC <elizochs> Don't be discouraged if another author's schedule, process, or advice doesn't work! Everyone's creativity/productivity works differently. Try a different writer's advice or mix and match until you find the perfect creative process for you. #writingtips #amwriting #writing
968906069530509312 2018-02-28 17:49:43 UTC <elizochs> An athlete doesnt waste their time by practicing; theyre becoming a better athlete. Same with #writing! Everything you write makes you a better writer, even the complete failures. Remember, winners are the ones who fail the most. #amwriting #writingtips
968857818764804098 2018-02-28 14:37:59 UTC <elizochs> Tip for #writersblock! Don't try to think of an entire scene/story, think only of first sentences! Come up with 10-20 first lines and choose the one that inspires you the most. #writingtips #amwriting #writerslife
968308709985280001 2018-02-26 02:16:01 UTC <elizochs> Really good short story by Eric Schlich! Only meant to browse but it hooked me to the end. Goals! http://crazyhorse.cofc.edu/featured/quantum-convention/ #amreading
967954645468549120 2018-02-25 02:49:05 UTC <elizochs> I hope there isn't a reading quiz tomorrow  #collegelife #englishmajor
967832388574306304 2018-02-25 18:43:17 UTC <elizochs> @goodreads The sci-fi/fantasy section! And then the YA section. And then the nonfiction section. And then the parking lot section, because by then, the store's probably closed. :(
967828234359463936 2018-02-25 18:26:47 UTC <elizochs> Details are important, but if a detail is irrelevant to the POV character, the plot, and/or the story's mood, it's just empty space. Cut it! #writingtips #amwriting #writing
967503402950381568 2018-02-24 20:56:01 UTC <elizochs> Trying my hand at flash fiction and I... can't tell if it's art or trash? What makes a good short story? What details are necessary? I'm an overwriter and I'm scared. #amwriting #andprobablyfailing
