965943732410503168 2018-02-20 13:38:26 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @AriMelber @TheBeatWithAri Look into the 70000 votes in 3 states technicality. Hillary won by 3 million votes.
965150434687094785 2018-02-18 09:06:09 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @Evan_McMullin 0. There will have been interference if Hillary wins.
964999130744545280 2018-02-17 23:04:56 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @jonfavs This is new. Last we heard the investigations had gone on too long.
964160365234966531 2018-02-15 15:31:58 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> Short threadhttps://twitter.com/shannonrwatts/status/964159107195289600
964025284914745344 2018-02-14 06:35:13 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @SenBillNelson @MSNBC You keep interviewing the same old people who have no solutions. I naively pray there is no next time, but if it happens again, please prominently include people who are actually doing something. Moms Demand Action is one such group.
963374703552458752 2018-02-13 11:30:02 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @chrislhayes They keep telling us who they are. It is up to us to believe them.

959130867888254976 2018-02-01 18:26:33 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @Evan_McMullin @Saysyeswecan As in I requested my pups help when she launched a scheme to grab my socks and run off with them.
958713896113786881 2018-01-31 14:49:39 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JustBeaTee Trump is by his own account a sexual predator. I am revolted by that. I am not revolted by any womans reaction to his crimes.
958706850027003905 2018-01-31 14:21:39 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @MattHolohan @jaketapper @votrsante Exactly. They try to both sides womens reaction to the harassment and the actual harassment. A man attacked a woman,  but look, other women are not appropriately horrified!
958609557139476480 2018-01-30 07:55:03 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @morgfair @MSNBC If he had put in protections for the special counsel like Kamala Harris tried to get him to do in the beginning, he wouldnt facing the smears now, because he wouldnt be in the direct path to get to Mueller. He had a lot of fun evading her questions though.
958569053400035329 2018-01-30 05:14:06 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @PreetBharara They dont have a problem with family reunification. They have a problem with brown people.
958492738013618176 2018-01-30 00:10:51 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper Sure he can. If he can read a teleprompter, he can also erase all our knowledge of everything we know to be true about him. Im hopeful
958468509704572928 2018-01-30 22:34:34 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JoyAnnReid Hope they have an economic message for women. They economy may be good but women lag behind even when they are doing an equivalent or better job
958358301548433410 2018-01-30 15:16:39 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @SallyQYates Is the FBI smarter than Nunes? That is the question
958076356625141760 2018-01-29 20:36:18 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @brianbeutler @matthewamiller The press tripping over themselves for access shifts the window of acceptability
957979809224839169 2018-01-29 14:12:39 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @ZuZuToo3 Well need to keep that in mind as the rest of the media gears up to tell us that the very fine speech will mean Democrats should be worried about Nov 2018.

955381439725522944 2018-01-22 10:07:40 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @maggieNYT Judging from the millions at the womens marches, Id say its a bug.
955091983810351106 2018-01-21 14:57:28 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @shannonrwatts @peevish Exactly. Always willing and able to run interference on behalf of Trump
954768578934444034 2018-01-20 17:32:22 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> Ok, hand him over NOWhttps://twitter.com/cuteoverloads/status/954710865785380864
954365311591047168 2018-01-19 14:49:56 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> You forgot the laughing tears emoji. The bots pair their belligerence with it for some strange reason.

953291235585941505 2018-01-16 15:41:56 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @brianbeutler @Eugene_Scott 6 percent seems too high. Whats the margin of error????
952629909901410306 2018-01-14 19:54:04 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @yashar @KatyTurNBC It was reported, but what we get comes through the lens of a not very diverse body of reporters. Not diverse enough in terms of gender and race, so what happens is we end up talking about economic anxiety.
952509589194493953 2018-01-14 11:55:57 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @RealDLHughley @BillKristol @TadderAnne I used to mistake this for cowardice. Its more sinister. The people who are quietly outraged on background where nobody can see or hear them, have one thing in common. They all hope they can use the bigotry to their advantage. Everyone else is speaking up loudly.
952370168419835904 2018-01-13 02:41:56 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @RealDLHughley @BillKristol Why is he asking others to walk out if he cant share his name? Same difference
952288048779325440 2018-01-13 21:15:38 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @AriMelber @Yamiche Heartbreak and despair? I would have imagined it would be more annoying and irritating

949265642045235200 2018-01-05 13:05:40 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @HoneyDemForce @BobbyBoon3 They do, but it has to be targeted to apply pressure. Pick the one corporation that has the most influence on your congressman.

947948604928548864 2018-01-01 21:52:14 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @nytimes I can tell without looking that a black woman did not write that article.
947878894107004931 2018-01-01 17:15:13 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @nytimes @MelissaJPeltier Indeed. Like we didnt just see the empty Christmas tree lighting at the White House none of the invigorated voters cared to attend. Not to forget the shrinking base.

945628608466432000 2017-12-26 12:13:23 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @LibyaLiberty Burning bras didnt prevent male oppression in the US either. Perhaps womens clothing isnt the problem?
945265926563401729 2017-12-25 12:12:13 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @jonfavs Is it petty to be waiting for Obamas Merry Christmas to have 10 times more likes?

944005057611292672 2017-12-21 00:41:59 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @thetalltexan Thats because for them Merry Christmas is a weapon - an aggression instead of the idea of peace and goodwill which it is supposed to be.

942839762985119745 2017-12-18 19:31:31 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @samstein How many men run round in corporate America oblivious that they are out of their league, though painfully obvious to everyone who works for them?

942787713002037251 2017-12-18 16:04:41 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @yashar Interesting, considering Trumps and the GOPs approval ratings are on a steady decline.

942394840003772416 2017-12-17 14:03:33 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @jaketapper The White House press listens to the lies, and then enjoys some potluck with the liars. All so very cosy. Nothing to see here.

928183440528281600 2017-11-08 08:52:31 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JoyAnnReid How you get enough people out to vote in state races. Field a candidate for EVERY race. Even dog catcher. Source: Somebodys twitter chart

923583915511746566 2017-10-26 16:15:39 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @MelissaJPeltier @chrislhayes But the real story is why in the world are crime investigators investigating criminal theft

922660063147372549 2017-10-23 03:04:35 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @jaketapper POTUS has succeeded it making more Americans aware of the protest against police brutality. Have to give him that.

914179189103882241 2017-09-30 17:24:37 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JoyAnnReid It's the flag. They don't like horizontal stripes
914106670980136960 2017-09-30 12:36:28 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JoyAnnReid Where's the press? They've dropped the ball on covering Pueto Rico.

912721360526479361 2017-09-26 16:51:44 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @Susan_Hennessey African Americans are overrepresented in the military by the way, case anyone's asking.  19% in military 13% in US.
912086778022121473 2017-09-24 22:50:08 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @TechnicallyRon @Eugene_Scott It means they know that racism and police brutality are indefensible.
911854696410775553 2017-09-24 07:27:55 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @BenSasse What about the constitution? Is it on the same side with him and the flag?
911736055975567361 2017-09-23 23:36:29 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @BenSasse What's a better way? Do tell

911131480218374150 2017-09-22 07:34:07 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JoyAnnReid Because they keep winning elections. How they win those elections is the question.
906331874750066691 2017-09-08 01:42:12 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @RantingOwl @ira It's just economic anxiety.
904489646507294720 2017-09-03 23:41:50 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JoyAnnReid Even if that outcome is spending 7 years writing a rubbish healthcare bill
903634572793057280 2017-09-01 15:04:05 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JoyAnnReid I wish he knew someone who could persuade the US government to provide the necessary help.
903370964322406404 2017-08-31 21:36:36 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @PeterAlexander He could undo proposed billions of dollars in cuts for disaster relief instead and keep his million

899311561298374657 2017-08-20 16:45:59 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @BuzzFeedBen @nycsouthpaw Sent my money to the ACLU. ACLU acts, DEMs send the money to networks to pay for ads.
894667201751523329 2017-08-07 21:10:57 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @heraldleader @AlisonForKY Direct Recording Electronic voting machines with no paper trail for auditing have no business in a democracy
894549768499802112 2017-08-07 13:24:19 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @peterdaou @JoyAnnReid @politico even with all that, they would still lose without gerrymandering and voter suppression
894269415314915329 2017-08-06 18:50:17 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JoyAnnReid second that
893938731345903617 2017-08-05 20:56:16 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @ChelseaClinton @RyanQuadri Don't give them oxygen or they'll keep coming back.
892390767322427393 2017-08-01 14:25:13 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @heraldleader @AlisonForKY Recently moved in KY. Voter address update was seamlessly easy. but need paper ballot trail for transparency
891851837401423872 2017-07-30 02:43:42 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @SenGillibrand @PamVictor Fact
891687412417613828 2017-07-30 15:50:20 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @CharlesMBlow @bleahy4 @FloMillet True, but white women have pulled down that average to 54%
891471176291299329 2017-07-29 01:31:05 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @CharlesMBlow @bleahy4 white men

890283962513457153 2017-07-26 18:53:31 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @PeterAlexander to be fair, he has no idea what on the budget.
889946118385262593 2017-07-25 20:31:03 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JoyAnnReid @AngeliaWS Although 40% of eligible voters just don't vote. So maybe there's still a way to win
886426090163642368 2017-07-15 03:23:43 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @jaketapper Delayed until McCain is well enough to vote to take healthcare away from others?
886287108008181761 2017-07-15 18:11:27 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @chrislhayes @Sensei415 This is how it will go: We want to get to a Yes. We converted 15 strong Nos to weak Nos and 20 weak Nos to a Yes.
886024918911115264 2017-07-14 00:49:36 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> Awwhttps://twitter.com/gerrardsprime/status/885619199221137409

884092788421390336 2017-07-09 16:52:01 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @peter_cazar @ericgarland Advance testing of the impenetrable cyber security system?
883709066987663361 2017-07-08 15:27:14 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @StribLopez Nah, she'll be overqualified at that point.
883459238311362560 2017-07-07 22:54:30 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @RepAdamSchiff Fox and hens set up joint working group on henhouse security
882977814777122816 2017-07-06 15:01:30 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @JoyAnnReid @AgathaC80 Oh boy. Cue another month of sending surrogates out to lie about crowd sizes 
882517274564988928 2017-07-05 08:31:29 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @PreetBharara Right still thinks the rich are opprressed
882510123805151234 2017-07-05 08:03:04 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @PreetBharara Left is still prrotesting massive trransfer of wealth from poor to rich
881573566248099845 2017-07-02 18:01:31 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @LucyAppa otherwise our representatives will issue stern words, we will nod in agreement and most probably nothing will come of it.
881572459765530624 2017-07-02 17:57:07 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @LucyAppa we will never have that unless we pay attention to election integrity. Voter suppression, gerrymandering, paper ballots.
881564252196286469 2017-07-02 17:24:31 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @RepAdamSchiff @dontfallfor45 @LucyAppa Agreed, but he will be more effective as the most senior member.
881562929107218432 2017-07-02 17:19:15 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @RepAdamSchiff @dontfallfor45 @LucyAppa Paper ballots in every state, focus on voter suppression so voters can bring sanity back.

880796884356534273 2017-06-30 14:35:16 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @VABVOX ...btw I think universal healthcare is a fundamental human right
880796700155285504 2017-06-30 14:34:32 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @VABVOX Because the Democrats spent years running away from the ACA until Bill Clinton gave the speech at the 2012 convention...
880788536093528064 2017-06-30 14:02:05 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @VABVOX followed by the Democrats convincing themselves they lost because  the voters don't like the ACA
880436098752819200 2017-06-29 14:41:38 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @ezraklein all because Hillary's voice sounded like a woman's voice, AKA shrill, when she had to speak loudly at rallies.
880235270460907520 2017-06-28 01:23:37 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @DawnHFoster you could have used your crystal ball

879630608087093248 2017-06-27 09:20:54 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @VABVOX @pewresearch so proud of the young-uns. Now if only they can be bothered to roll out of bed on Election Day.
879627537592221696 2017-06-27 09:08:42 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein Can you write your bill and send to CBO for scoring?
879449145542574080 2017-06-26 21:19:50 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @RepAdamSchiff No, the choice between the yacht and the private jet. It was always about the tax cuts.
879367096152576000 2017-06-26 15:53:48 UTC <niinoshdelsarto> @voxdotcom @JoyAnnReid Those 400 households are clearly hurting.
