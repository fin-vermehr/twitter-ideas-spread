971578270335619073 2018-03-07 02:48:05 UTC <AGCNow> Walking out brings publicity and attention, and gets people talking about the issues, like YOU with this TWEET.  And we'll be doing more when we vote the money-hungry politicians who value donations over CHILDREN AND THEIR LIVES.  Liberal Morals are CLEAR. CHILDREN OVER MONEY.https://twitter.com/RealJack/status/971541097817178112
971577726611132421 2018-03-07 02:45:55 UTC <AGCNow> Yet, the lack of gun control is leading to dead children at a rate never seen elsewhere in the entire world, with civilized and educated gun laws.  It's a valid argument, just because you want to ignore it, doesn't make it not true.https://twitter.com/jason_howerton/status/971537521766215681
971577349601939457 2018-03-07 02:44:25 UTC <AGCNow> The TRUE face of gun control are children going to school, afraid of being shot because the NRA donates hundreds of millions to politicians who value MONEY or LIVES, and they'll be VOTED OUT in the coming elections!https://twitter.com/DLoesch/status/971572367842562048
971577006558253056 2018-03-07 02:43:04 UTC <AGCNow> Another misleading republican, spreading lies about gun control!  60 percent statewide of firearms that are seized by Maryland law enforcement are not Maryland guns, that goes up  exponentially in places like Baltimore City and Prince George's County,  http://www.wbaltv.com/article/i-team-finds-illegal-guns-in-baltimore-coming-from-out-of-state/10335701https://twitter.com/antonia_okafor/status/971097992487940096
971575619162173440 2018-03-07 02:37:33 UTC <AGCNow> Republicans are advocating for gun shoot outs in SCHOOLS between  teachers and students! Why not just ban assault weapons  instead of turning schools into WAR ZONES.  #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain
971575285941526528 2018-03-07 02:36:13 UTC <AGCNow> Republicans say all teachers shouldn't have guns, that's stupid. Only those  with extensive experience/training handling them. Yet they thinks  anyone should be able to walk into a store and buy an assault rifle, and thousands of rounds of ammo.     #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain
971574147095650304 2018-03-07 02:31:42 UTC <AGCNow> The NRA has spent $203.2 million on political activities since 1998.  If you want to drain the swamp, start with the NRA and it's lobbyists turning our schools into warzones. Your CHILDREN are being killed.  #GunControlNow #NeverAgain
971573522739990528 2018-03-07 02:29:13 UTC <AGCNow> We cannot live in a society where our children perform "active shooter drills", surrounded by armed teachers. We cannot turn our schools into warzones, encouraging shoot-outs between students and teachers.  #GunControlNow #NeverAgain
