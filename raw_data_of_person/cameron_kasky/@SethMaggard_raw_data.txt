971581060122226688 2018-03-07 02:59:10 UTC <SethMaggard> @realDonaldTrump You are the PRESIDENT! You don't understand basic Econ. 101. The national DEBT is 20 trillion and last year's trade deficit was $566 B. Ask for help from someone, anyone. Baron probably has a better grasp than you demonstrate. Study up dude!
970770807000453121 2018-03-05 21:19:31 UTC <SethMaggard> @realDonaldTrump You haven't done ANYTHING to prevent future attacks by Russia on our  Democracy. YOU have failed to implement sanctions MANDATED by congress. YOU haven't allowed a response to this attack. You are a puppet, or just coincidentally doing exactly what a Russian puppet would do.

Making demonstrably false claims undermines not only your own reputation but makes suspect the movements you support. Taste your words before you spit them out.
967494740923969536 2018-02-24 20:21:36 UTC <SethMaggard> @JenandZen If you do figure that out I'd love to understand.
967488964058742784 2018-02-24 19:58:38 UTC <SethMaggard> @dennyhamlin @FedEx Compare that to the feeling of knowing that it is just a matter of days until another group of kids is slaughtered by people with access to the weapons of war promulgated and enabled by the death cult that is the NRA.
967488441201016832 2018-02-24 19:56:34 UTC <SethMaggard> @dennyhamlin @DISupdates @safekids @FedEx You'd do better helping 'safekids' by ending your relationship with the death-mongers at the NRA. (They advocate doing nothing to stop the near-daily slaughter of school children, in case you have forgotten.)
967487973926191105 2018-02-24 19:54:42 UTC <SethMaggard> @FedEx FedEx: absolutely, positively the most effective carrier you can choose when you want to support the blood-lust of the NRA and their vision of a  society would be 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short'.

967192506247950336 2018-02-23 00:20:37 UTC <SethMaggard> @JeffBezos Don't care about anything you are doing or promoting as long as you continue to enable the blood thirsty gun lobby that is the NRA. You have blood on your hand Mr. Bezos.

967137603421007872 2018-02-23 20:42:27 UTC <SethMaggard> @Hertz @March4LivesATL @Kahnaynay1969 The NRA specifically discourages strengthening background checks. The NRA is lobbies for gun manufacturers not responsible gun owners.

966522463730282497 2018-02-21 03:58:07 UTC <SethMaggard> Guns should be an privilege, earned through training and demonstration of sound character, not a right. I'm an American. I live in Canada.

965292624675454979 2018-02-18 18:31:10 UTC <SethMaggard> @realDonaldTrump DJT: I try to maintain sympathy for you, imagining how hurt, helpless, and impotent you must feel on the inside, but you need to start trying to be a leader instead of lashing out with lies, conspiracies, and inexcusable ad hominem attacks on those with whom you disagree. Please

Just because they worked to elect you doesn't mean you can turn the tables on them with economic and political sanctions. Please protect our democracy. Please.

949380115019923456 2018-01-05 20:40:32 UTC <SethMaggard> @_Amanda_Killian Absolutely, and same goes for national parks. Nobody likes to pay to get into these cultural treasures, but as funding for arts, culture, and public space has been continually eviscerated for 40 years, operating budgets have to be funded somehow.
949368538468311041 2018-01-05 19:54:32 UTC <SethMaggard> @robreiner It isn't that the GOP doesn't accept that reality, it is worse; they know who and what he is and have decided that as long as he'll rubber stamp their corrupt legislation he is useful. They are complicit in this attack on American institutions and norms.

946545563041873920 2017-12-28 00:57:02 UTC <SethMaggard> @benjaminwittes I'm going to use the possibility of fighting Putin as my workout motivator too! Thanks
945852086230564864 2017-12-26 03:01:25 UTC <SethMaggard> @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry your father didn't show you enough love Donald, I know it must still hurt. Wishing you a better year in 2018!
945851579529179136 2017-12-26 02:59:24 UTC <SethMaggard> @realDonaldTrump 7.3 million people just signed up for Obamacare in states Trump won -- representing more than 80% of the total 8.8 million new signups.
945530223264542720 2017-12-25 05:42:26 UTC <SethMaggard> @cjane87 Yes, yes you were. I turned 14 in 1990, and my friend Denny and I spent a lot of time hanging out at the SeaTac airport. We'd return carts for the deposit, we'd ride our bikes down the spiral of the parking garage, and generally make a nuisance of ourselves, never got hassled.
945527440285110272 2017-12-25 05:31:23 UTC <SethMaggard> @bessbell I knew it!
944709205524602880 2017-12-23 23:20:01 UTC <SethMaggard> @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @Realjmannarino @LisaSzilagyi While that seems less like 'fake' and more 'partisan', I am interested in how one might accurately judge an organization's motivations. For me obvious separation of opinion/editorial from news is an important pre req. Don't gen. agree with WSJ editorials but like their news dept.
944706554636378112 2017-12-23 23:09:29 UTC <SethMaggard> @OutOfTheBlue201 Journalism, like everything else, requires that one make choices and decisions as to what to pursue & what to leave out. Good journalists (the majority IMO) seek to understand their own biases and the viewpoints of all stakeholders. Not every story will support YOUR impression.
944681641389178880 2017-12-23 21:30:29 UTC <SethMaggard> @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @Realjmannarino I'm not finding that particularly helpful in understanding your strategy for identifying 'fake' news sources, care to elucidate further?   Thanks.
944674012424105984 2017-12-23 21:00:10 UTC <SethMaggard> @steveliesman @MCaruso_Cabrera @denniskneale Yeah! 'Cause when you are rich enough you don't need no stinkin' civil society!

944664203360477184 2017-12-23 20:21:11 UTC <SethMaggard> @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @Realjmannarino J.: What defines 'fake' to you? Not trolling, just honestly trying to understand. Thanks.
944655646980415488 2017-12-23 19:47:11 UTC <SethMaggard> @ExumAM RT says it's fine, I trust them.
944297970920439808 2017-12-22 20:05:55 UTC <SethMaggard> @angelrose9392 @mitchellvii Also, the FRED data seems to show a linear increase starting ~ March 2010 from 11.5 million to 12.5 million in Nov 2017. 1 mil/91 months = ~11,000 manu. jobs added/ month. Don't know that this has much to do with Mr. Trump.
944296357170253824 2017-12-22 19:59:30 UTC <SethMaggard> @angelrose9392 @mitchellvii Where are you finding these stats? Looking at Federal Reserve bank data I'm not seeing it. Or perhaps I'm just not reading it right. Thanks.https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP

943641704824954885 2017-12-20 00:38:09 UTC <SethMaggard> @SenateMajLdr if Republicans couldn't get  a single Democrat to vote for legislation of this magnitude. I'd have thought, maybe this isn't such a good idea. 2/
943641501111693312 2017-12-20 00:37:20 UTC <SethMaggard> @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell Jan 8, 2014- "...chaos will always be the case if you approach legislation without regard for the views of the other side. Without some meaningful buy-in, you guarantee a food fight. You guarantee instability and strife.... That's what I would have concluded    1/
943250605220302848 2017-12-19 22:44:03 UTC <SethMaggard> @MichaelSLinden @DKengerish @jne7043 @oregonpigqueen Speaking for myself, I'm less concerned about millionaires and billionaires being able to afford new yachts are more with the huge deficit whole and the defunding of programs like CHIP to pay for it. Call me crazy, but I like civil society and people not dying of poverty.
943207428618723328 2017-12-19 19:52:29 UTC <SethMaggard> @MichaelSLinden @oregonpigqueen Hahaha! Corporations are sitting on trillions of dollars in cash already, they won't build anything, they'll just increase CEO pay and buyback stock. You'd think 40 years of trickle-down BS being proved wrong would be enough to kill this zombie; guess not. Look @ Kansas
941136225217396737 2017-12-13 02:42:16 UTC <SethMaggard> @lisamurkowski Even the 'least you can do' would be enough to ensure CHIP continues in its lifesaving role, so you promising to do everything means there is NO way it won't be funded, right?
941019636052586496 2017-12-13 18:58:59 UTC <SethMaggard> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Is the misspelling of 'Media' a way for Trump's handlers to get us to believe he wrote this? I just don't see current DJT  using the word hence; just not buying it.
939397176643301377 2017-12-08 07:31:54 UTC <SethMaggard> @USDOL @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Thank you President Obama, and thank you President Trump for recognizing his efforts!

939042238536888320 2017-12-08 08:01:30 UTC <SethMaggard> @Education4Libs @GaiaLovesMe @annasdtc @AyanTrumpsIslam There is accountability in care. All the doctors are privately employed (outside of hospitals) there is regional and provincial oversight. Not perfect, nobody excluded, no medical bankruptcy, better.

939040590569783296 2017-12-07 07:54:57 UTC <SethMaggard> @Education4Libs @rockyrose @letoile_loulou @JohnGuandolo Well, I think we can all agree that the world would be a better place without 'nin-muslims'.

Whether you are in the media, politics, or anywhere else abuse of power is unacceptable & shouldnt be tolerated at any place at any level. President Trump must know that & thats why he must step down

Probably...
937590288108855297 2017-12-03 07:51:58 UTC <SethMaggard> @kurteichenwald They WANT a debt-interest death spiral as justification for what Norquist said:  "I simply want to reduce [the government] to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub."
