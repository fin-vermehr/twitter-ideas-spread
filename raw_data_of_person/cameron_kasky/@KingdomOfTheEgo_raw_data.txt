963199449383276546 2018-02-12 23:53:38 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @banebutwoke Hey, here's fun: I discovered Twitter's "the DPRK are actually good and everyone is lying about them" community today
963154850262417408 2018-02-12 20:56:25 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Judoon_Platoon "Stop initiating force against me!"
963133146874163203 2018-02-12 19:30:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 Remember: authoritarianism is bad and the despot you don't know being antagonistic to the despot you do know doesn't make the former better than the latter
963132898369994752 2018-02-12 19:29:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 So I'm out
963132876115103744 2018-02-12 19:29:06 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 I get the feeling that ideology is eclipsing hard evidence here and evidence isn't a part of this conversation - it's rooted in ideology. And for that reason neither of us is going to change the mind of the other
963132602210234373 2018-02-12 19:28:01 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 Some valid criticisms. But using criticism as a way of downplaying other actions and observations of a group seems to me a pretty good way to downplay the actions and observations of literally every group on earth
963131317830512640 2018-02-12 19:22:54 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 Amnesty Intl makes its money from membership and individual donations and does not accept money from governments or ideological groups. Is that enough?
963130878745595904 2018-02-12 19:21:10 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 Exactly what source would be good enough beyond your own first hand experience? Every group takes money from somewhere.
963130345343324161 2018-02-12 19:19:03 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 Or do you consider groups like Amnesty as tools of imperialism
963130248098394112 2018-02-12 19:18:39 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 We absolutely do not know next to nothing about them
963130052962594816 2018-02-12 19:17:53 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 Yes but the West demonising NK does not absolve NK of things that have been verified by defectors, refugees and multiple nations beyond just the US   Just because America has an agenda against North Korea doesn't mean that everything they say about them is false
963128671186964480 2018-02-12 19:12:23 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 maybe capitalist, American imperialism being awful doesn't quite negate literal atrocities
963128333671305217 2018-02-12 19:11:03 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 have you at all considered the possibility that everyone is bad
963096293823471616 2018-02-12 17:03:44 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 okay, thanks for the clarification, living embodiment of the horseshoe theory

963028447244242945 2018-02-12 12:34:08 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BuzzFeedNews @konshu82 I'm not entirely sure but are you implying that NK's whistleblowers/defectors were lying or exaggerating?

963020005888667648 2018-02-12 12:00:36 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @guardian Simon's reasons for bringing back steam trains appear to be: 1) people like steam trains  2) burning coal is worse for the environment than diesel (???) 3) ticket prices will go up
962769365455294464 2018-02-11 19:24:38 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I cherish the memory of when I interviewed @HamillHimself and said "may the force be with you" as I left the room thinking it would sound awesome and it instead coming out like I was a five year old with severe anxiety

960138530444980224 2018-02-04 13:10:38 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith Yeah, I totally get that. I've actually never been hugely into FF but I'm a sucker for a pretty open world fantasy game.  Total segue but have you played KotOR? Not PS4 but it hits those points perfectly
960137759460651009 2018-02-04 13:07:35 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith Aaaah, damn. That's good though! Final Fantasy XV is meant to be really good and open world?

959386580367667200 2018-02-02 11:22:39 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @trevorphillips @ollyhiggins It just reeks of money-grabbing. The amount of money they make (and they make a fuckload, trust me), the shortcuts they take (again, trust me) and they *still*  resort to cheap tricks like VIP tiering, dishonest advertising and extortionate booking fees.
959379893875363840 2018-02-02 10:56:05 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @trevorphillips @ollyhiggins you do actually get concerts where areas closer to the stage are tiered off for different ticket holders and yes, I think that is incredibly shady too
959372285898616832 2018-02-02 10:25:51 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @trevorphillips @ollyhiggins Believing that just because someone has a full time job they can afford to splash 50 quid (80 on weekend shows) on theatre tickets is an incredibly blinkered view tbh   secret cinema is an incredibly exclusionary event and has worsened with all this 'full zone access' nonsense

959052397342490624 2018-02-01 13:14:44 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @OllyThorn @BoldingAndy I think they're better about it now because people made a big fuss of it a few years ago but yes, I know that, back in the day, most of their performers were volunteershttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11480495/Secret-Cinema-criticised-for-use-of-unpaid-actors.html

959049395726700545 2018-02-01 13:02:48 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @OllyThorn they have a history of not paying performers, they charge exuberant and misleading prices for tickets, their latest show denies audience members access to certain areas if they don't pay, the production quality is lacking these days and they just sell merch to you once you're in

945623654045544449 2017-12-26 11:53:42 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @youngvulgarian I totally get seeing it as a cultural peculiarity from afar, yeah. From the inside it's a great source of shame though
945623173910933504 2017-12-26 11:51:48 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @youngvulgarian First one is right but the second bit is kinda disappointing because it's a serious class issue
945608383469641728 2017-12-26 10:53:01 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Anyway to surmise, Moffat lost it, S5 made it all worth it, Twelve was a balla, Capaldi deserved better, TUAT was unnecessary and sentimental regenerations are the worst
945607905717510144 2017-12-26 10:51:07 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Also bad: Clara being back for literally no reason, just like Amy Pond was for Eleven, though I guess it fits since they're both the exact same character
945606821380837376 2017-12-26 10:46:49 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> And it was a beautiful speech, exceptionally well-written, there's no denying. It was just utterly unnecessary to the point of being almost nonsensical.   In a way, sums up late era Moffat fairly well
945606189076840448 2017-12-26 10:44:18 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I always hoped Twelve would go out like the character he was promised to be: loud, on fire and with no regard for anyone else's immediate safety   instead we got a sad meta speech because Moffat can't prevent his own ego from eclipsing his writing #doctorwho
945605357522640898 2017-12-26 10:41:00 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> There's a crucial spot to find between "sick of being the Doctor and wants to die" and "desperately doesn't want to stop being the Doctor and would happily murder you to keep going" which neither RTD nor Moffat ever really hit (except with Nine)
945604538052108288 2017-12-26 10:37:45 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> protip: Twelve's regeneration should have happened at the end of The Doctor Falls. It should have been quick and unsentimental, and he should have embraced it with glee, not with beleaguered resignation.

942111871611670528 2017-12-16 19:19:08 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @jowrotethis hey Joanna - noticed that you're behind a great deal of VF's current TLJ/SW content. You guys taking pitches on that topic or are you all a bit full up on that at the mo? thanks!
942047461161492481 2017-12-16 15:03:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> At a push, ANH is about ordinary heroism and ROTJ is about redemption. But you don't come out of ROTJ thinking "yes, I can be redeemed". You do come out of TLJ thinking "yes, there is hope in the future, in the next generation". It just works.
942046845894905857 2017-12-16 15:00:45 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> The Last Jedi is the first Star Wars film that is *about* something: failure, resilience and optimism. Looking away from the past and into the future and finding something better. No other SW film, even Empire or ANH, has a message so finely crafted. That's why TLJ is the best.

941055754949324801 2017-12-13 21:22:30 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> There's a shot in The Last Jedi that echoes this one very strongly - would be fascinating to know whether it was intentional @rianjohnson https://twitter.com/moodvintage/status/926863362255974400

940363088213303296 2017-12-11 23:30:05 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Griddlemarks Funnily enough, the ROTJ cues I noticed were totally unrelated and came out of nowhere

935104778706792448 2017-11-27 11:15:27 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @thomas_violence really only Infinity War films will be darker I think (and even they have the Guardians/Thor/Spidey)  Marvel's days of reigning it in are basically over. Gunn made it and Taika solidified it
935104393569071106 2017-11-27 11:13:55 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @thomas_violence Solid bet that Ant-Man and the Wasp will be more confidently over-the-top than the first, Captain Marvel will do for the 90s what GotG did for the late 70s and you know Black Panther will be all that too
935104005151313921 2017-11-27 11:12:22 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @thomas_violence and Doctor Strange and Homecoming and even Civil War in a kinda way - all of Marvel's recent roster has been colourful and fun and spectacular, GotG 1 showed them the way to go

927303193314328577 2017-11-05 22:34:44 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @hannahtraining @XenartThyl People wear crucifixes to commemorate somebody who died on a cross. Not exactly what's happening here, is it?
927274258912423939 2017-11-05 20:39:45 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @hannahtraining @lyon_laurel can you really not see the issue with normalising extreme political violence, no matter how long ago it was?
927234662573006849 2017-11-05 18:02:25 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> "ohhh my baby Finn is so perfect I just want to look after him I am screaming", said the completely normal not terrifying human being
927234324583337985 2017-11-05 18:01:04 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> good evening everyone, please stop with the creepy maternal posts about Finn Wolfhard, it's really fucked up
927165233956827137 2017-11-05 13:26:32 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> can't believe I feel unfashionable because I don't joke about bringing in socialism by murdering thousands of people
927164799875715072 2017-11-05 13:24:48 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> hello everyone, historical instances of extreme political violence, purges and mass executions aren't cute, fashionable or funny
927164379216465920 2017-11-05 13:23:08 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @hannahtraining hey there, the Terror killed tens of thousands of people, not convinced this is massively cute

913399848300359680 2017-09-28 13:47:48 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @EivindBerge You are confusing your medievalesque brand of insipid misogyny as coherent thought, which is pretty much what I expected from this chat
913399544708321280 2017-09-28 13:46:36 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @EivindBerge I'm excited for the day somebody smacks you repeatedly across the face and gets off scot-free because you failed to wear a helmet 

913398878967406593 2017-09-28 13:43:57 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @EivindBerge like how me saying "I think you're a piece of shit" literally means I think you're a piece of shit
913398804833034240 2017-09-28 13:43:39 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @EivindBerge "no means no" isn't a slogan, it's literally how words work. It's not some fucking buddhist idiom, no literally means no.

913398443732819968 2017-09-28 13:42:13 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @EivindBerge What is best of her ability? Violently attacking the man? Stabbing him? Summoning a horde of elephants? Why shouldn't it end at "no?"
913398265340731394 2017-09-28 13:41:31 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @EivindBerge Who gets to decide what "best of her ability" is? You? Or the man who rapes her?
913398096410931201 2017-09-28 13:40:50 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @EivindBerge rape does not exist on a sliding scale or a spectrum. A woman vocalises that she does not want to have sex and the man still does = rape
913397925526597632 2017-09-28 13:40:10 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @EivindBerge for somebody who's technically able to write and understand English, you sure do have a pretty shitty ability to comprehend words

912370109217427456 2017-09-25 17:35:59 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ByYourLogic as is idea that they fought for people's right to protest (in Iraq? really?)

911962436403638272 2017-09-24 14:36:02 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Jem_Collins I once saw a listing advertising a job which would pay 1 per 500-word article, and demanded 20 articles a day. For a roofing website.

892069238852263936 2017-07-31 17:07:35 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Judoon_Platoon I really do understand that, but my Manson-esque dedication to AF can't make me feel anything but love about it
892068663712468992 2017-07-31 17:05:17 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Judoon_Platoon If it helps, they're not actually selling them
892068474905931777 2017-07-31 17:04:32 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @arcadefire You guys really should have set a limit on how many we can buy. 6400 well spent imo
892006891638968321 2017-07-31 12:59:50 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MikeStuchbery_ I need freelance writing work if that counts
891686917816844288 2017-07-30 15:48:22 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ChipHinkleman hi Chip. Big fan. Do you have a contact number or email I can use for either yourself or your company? Thanks!
891682476128710658 2017-07-30 15:30:43 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @JackTheJobber I got your back bro
891682251297173504 2017-07-30 15:29:50 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @JackTheJobber slide into my DMs for his Facebook page and mobile number
891625175103438848 2017-07-30 11:43:01 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NadineDorries You're really giving a lot of weight to the opinions of this one fictional couple
891303933959962626 2017-07-29 14:26:32 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @lulu_nunn this was phrased stupidly. of course there's a 'point', and of course it needs to be done. better to say 'basically no chance of success'
891299921466404865 2017-07-29 14:10:35 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @lulu_nunn if the police/govt are sympathised with in public consciousness, there's just no point
891299731527356420 2017-07-29 14:09:50 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @lulu_nunn of course the weird irony is that I reckon a riot is more likely to achieve justice if the government/oppressors/whatever crack down harder
891299464123756544 2017-07-29 14:08:46 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @lulu_nunn unless, of course, the rioting flourishes into outright revolution, but that's a different issue
891299295923666945 2017-07-29 14:08:06 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @lulu_nunn I agree they can be necessary but success only comes with mass public support, an amenable government and a lot of luck on your side
891299199584804864 2017-07-29 14:07:43 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @lulu_nunn I'd take issue with the 'always' here, though, and plenty of riots have historically (and recently) led to some pretty awful shit happening
891269691410395137 2017-07-29 12:10:28 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @thwphipps Lisa Goes Gaga was robbed

891246874598023169 2017-07-29 10:39:48 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @lottelydia @KGOrphanides Quick search down internet lane tells me you're right. About 8000 between 1066-1100. Guess my knowledge is too constricted to 11th C.
891242201996550144 2017-07-29 10:21:14 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @lottelydia @KGOrphanides (Also first thing I'd go to is the Danelaw! This guy is such a tool)
891241994177191936 2017-07-29 10:20:24 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @lottelydia @KGOrphanides Putting aside PJW's utter idiocy, wasn't post-Conquest migration largely an elite thing? Small number of landowners and artisocracy?

890923788321398784 2017-07-28 13:15:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> not a single official in the Trump administration wouldn't look out of place whispering 'hail HYDRA' to a colleague

890656035647569920 2017-07-27 19:32:01 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MikeStuchbery_ @PrisonPlanet @AFDMurray @_walta I never said it invalidated it. I said it made it less believable.
890646309945745408 2017-07-27 18:53:22 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MikeStuchbery_ @PrisonPlanet @AFDMurray @_walta whereas PJW's knowledge doesn't extend past a one-page BBC website with a big picture of Romans on it
890646209882226689 2017-07-27 18:52:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MikeStuchbery_ @PrisonPlanet @AFDMurray @_walta i.e. that I'm inclined to side with her on matters of classics because she's literally one of the best classicists in the world
890645958291320832 2017-07-27 18:51:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MikeStuchbery_ @PrisonPlanet @AFDMurray @_walta I'd say I was going more for the fact that PJW's lack of a degree and Beard's extensive expertise helps makes her point more believable
890644675828240384 2017-07-27 18:46:52 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MikeStuchbery_ @PrisonPlanet @_walta @AFDMurray also, there's the fact that Beard actually presented a believable argument based on primary sources, whereas PJW is basically an idiot
890644378892460032 2017-07-27 18:45:41 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MikeStuchbery_ @PrisonPlanet @_walta @AFDMurray If I was deferring to Beard's knowledge about, say, the rules of badminton, because of her reputation as a classicist, you'd have a point
890644235837460480 2017-07-27 18:45:07 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MikeStuchbery_ @PrisonPlanet @_walta @AFDMurray What he said. Not much of a fallacy in deferring knowledge to someone like Beard, who's literally a world-leader in her field.

890586470142050304 2017-07-27 14:55:35 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MikeStuchbery_ are we seeing dozens of people going back and forth every month, or hundreds, or more?
890586374633607168 2017-07-27 14:55:12 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MikeStuchbery_ serious question: just how busy were shipping routes for passengers/migrants back and forth between Britain and the continent?

889831730051506176 2017-07-25 12:56:31 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith it's a good album, by the way, so \_()_/
889831624610807808 2017-07-25 12:56:06 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith I admire the faith you have in the intelligence of the many thousands of anonymous total strangers who follow you on the internet
889827479577395200 2017-07-25 12:39:37 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> watching people become unspeakably enraged by Arcade Fire's marketing strategy has totally made that strategy worth it
889827028698005505 2017-07-25 12:37:50 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith so what's happened here is that they've basically gotten you to advertise to your followers that they have a new album; I'd say it worked

886528718440718336 2017-07-16 10:11:32 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> mere potential of a female #13thDoctor has apparently turned GallifreyBase into 4chan

886264528018829312 2017-07-15 16:41:44 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @123cookiec @JacobDSmtih I'd say people who are actively antagonistic to the idea of innovation or creativity cos they consider themselves anti-PC are more toxic tbh

886226839961784320 2017-07-15 14:11:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @akhbar @jenanmoussa gotta love Twitter's autoplay. thanks for that one
886226612001415173 2017-07-15 14:11:04 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @123cookiec I gotta admire your attempt to paint the refusal to let female actors play a role as somehow feminist, though, so props for that
886226420434960384 2017-07-15 14:10:18 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @123cookiec the *only* reason the Doctor couldn't be a woman is if Time Lords couldn't change genders, and that's kinda moot because they're NOT REAL
886226365292441600 2017-07-15 14:10:05 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @123cookiec it's literally nothing like that, because those characters don't change their entire bodies every few years.
886224737533399040 2017-07-15 14:03:37 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @123cookiec he changes literally every five years or so  exactly what insurmountable masculine character trait of the Doctor's prevents him being a she?
886212665399537665 2017-07-15 13:15:39 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> imagine actually being scared that a character whose whole thing is that he can change his entire body at the cellular level might be a girl

861891700570148864 2017-05-09 10:32:49 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband Care to answer this?
861891325548871680 2017-05-09 10:31:19 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband So what would you do if you were an Afghani whose children were killed in a US air strike?

861890480728141825 2017-05-09 10:27:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband This tweet you just made could be flipped around to justify the execution of a British soldier. Hence why the logic is so so fucked up

861890094751506432 2017-05-09 10:26:26 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband Such a black and white mentality. Why do you think insurgencies happen in the first place? You don't think Afghanis are driven to joining
861889802572058624 2017-05-09 10:25:16 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband And that begins with adhering to rules of war that even the goddamn Wehrmacht adhered to
861889687987814401 2017-05-09 10:24:49 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband The distinction you make is not enough. Has to go further. We have to be far, far better - not only marginally
861889393648427010 2017-05-09 10:23:39 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband The Taliban execute criminals and prisoners of war. You're advocating... executing criminals and prisoners of war.
861888900574445568 2017-05-09 10:21:41 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband Hey, you're the one who wants to murder enemies of the state.

861887718674108417 2017-05-09 10:16:59 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband "Let's murder murderers!" - you, showing logic
861887474724982784 2017-05-09 10:16:01 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband Also, for the record, the word 'eradicated' has some fucked up connotations.
861887347184500737 2017-05-09 10:15:31 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband And you want to add the British Army to that list? Brilliant.
861887274887393280 2017-05-09 10:15:14 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband Want a list of forces which have freely broken Geneva like you suggest? Nazis, Japanese Empire, Viet Cong, North Korea, Al-Qaeda...
861887077541138432 2017-05-09 10:14:27 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @BBCNews @KerryHuband Loving your advocacy for wanton murder, but the rules of war still protect insurgents. Breaking them makes us no better.

825450346642305024 2017-01-28 21:07:53 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> also, does anyone else wish they could go back in time and be the people who bullied Richard Spencer at school?
825450214777553025 2017-01-28 21:07:21 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> isn't it weird that the people who throw around the word 'triggered' so much seem to be, well, permanently triggered?

823137329745432580 2017-01-22 11:56:47 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @justkelly_ok Here in the UK the police are as thinly-stretched, under-budgeted and overworked as any public service...

822801377915179009 2017-01-21 13:41:50 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @PhilosophyTube @AmonGoth___ wait, was it too anti-USA or was it calling the rebels nationalists fighting the Jews? Get your story straight

822799036889624576 2017-01-21 13:32:31 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Pandellax it's always worked in the past, after all
822798959018131457 2017-01-21 13:32:13 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Pandellax yeah that's an admirable thing to do but unconditional pacifism is absurd - you shouldn't hate seeing violence against fascism
822798428031819776 2017-01-21 13:30:06 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Jack_TheJobber they sacrificed popularity for integrity and I will always respect them for that. also, Congratulations was their best LP
822798099986915332 2017-01-21 13:28:48 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Pandellax in a lot of cases you're right, but that message chain was re: Richard Spencer and in that case yes, it is going to help
822797524931121158 2017-01-21 13:26:31 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Pandellax I mean the 'victim' in this case was *literally* a Nazi and espousing a "violence won't help" attitude is fundamentally ignorant
822796772955328513 2017-01-21 13:23:32 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> can't risk being too divided from them literal Nazis, eh? https://twitter.com/Pandellax/status/822788942651133952

822795254944428032 2017-01-21 13:17:30 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @PhilosophyTube @AmonGoth___ hey Mr. Nazi, I've always wondered - when you watch Indiana Jones or Star Wars, who do you root for?

822067796301479936 2017-01-19 13:06:50 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @IAmChrisRamsey p.s. realise the irony of not fitting all that into one tweet
822067725732347904 2017-01-19 13:06:33 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @IAmChrisRamsey ...a staffer writers all his tweets and wrongly told him it's 280, and doesn't want to tell him he got it wrong
822067530789519362 2017-01-19 13:05:47 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @IAmChrisRamsey In an interview the other day he claimed that Twitter had upped the character count to 280, so somebody theorised that

771719710614355968 2016-09-02 14:41:31 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @youngvulgarian went off-the-cuff interviewing British Sea Power once; ended up discussing finer points of monkey colonisation of universe

771284949299240960 2016-09-01 09:53:56 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith and the ridiculous attention given to the train story empowered Corbynite anger and damaged Labour. Helped nobody
771284734760652800 2016-09-01 09:53:05 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith been through this before bro but responsibility for what appears in media also lies with, y'know, the media

770042040260395008 2016-08-28 23:35:03 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Jaden Smith is ruining this single-handed. Fucking horrible actor. #TheGetDown
770028024918110211 2016-08-28 22:39:22 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> So the Get Down is just really weirdly directed, isn't it? And not in a good way

770010207464329216 2016-08-28 21:28:34 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @metpoliceuk @MetPoliceEvents so like 70's worth, then
770010015348424705 2016-08-28 21:27:48 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Jack_TheJobber @tgcparker I knew he would mostly be to blame for choosing a shockingly dull film
770009139342966787 2016-08-28 21:24:19 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Jack_TheJobber @tgcparker airplane would have been a fantastic choice

768611676631556097 2016-08-24 00:51:18 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @youngvulgarian it's a real shame but it's something we just have to try to fix. Internet culture has a way to go
768611013054824448 2016-08-24 00:48:40 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @youngvulgarian the Internet, basically
768500211459166208 2016-08-24 17:28:23 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Glinner Reading comprehension, bud.
768500166286512129 2016-08-24 17:28:12 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Glinner yeah, and I pointed out the irony in the word stemming from a Nazi collaborator considering you're pretty much one
768499335969509376 2016-08-24 17:24:54 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Glinner Quisling, you tool. Quisling was a Nazi collaborator.
768497070449852416 2016-08-24 17:15:54 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Glinner absolutely supreme irony in using the name of a Nazi collaborator there
768496490515951616 2016-08-24 17:13:35 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> This is the worst account on Twitter  https://twitter.com/thereaibanksy/status/768304681328087040

768422366238179328 2016-08-24 12:19:03 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith well, quite. I think there's a middle ground though
768419713064046592 2016-08-24 12:08:30 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith fair enough. I'm just a bit tired of seeing it and think that giving it precedence is playing into how Corbynites view the press
768416316718022656 2016-08-24 11:55:01 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith I guess so, but look at how much it's come up in your tweets alone. Disproportionate to how important it actually is, surely
768415379957899264 2016-08-24 11:51:17 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith we know Corbyn is a PR mess, but why bait his team when there are better ways of exposing his flaws
768415132577894400 2016-08-24 11:50:18 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith I don't mean any offence, I just think giving so much time to a story this facile hands ammo to the 'MSM conspiracy' crowd
768414634806243328 2016-08-24 11:48:20 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Hey, media geniuses: putting this much energy into this facile fucking train story gives SO much ammo to the 'MSM conspiracy' crowd
768414354018594816 2016-08-24 11:47:13 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith I'm legit stunned at the energy you're putting into this
768413087602995201 2016-08-24 11:42:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith @MirrorPolitics It's just pointless nonsense that would be better placed in the Sun. You're better than this
768412924637540352 2016-08-24 11:41:32 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith @MirrorPolitics so many other actual areas to attack - like policy or lack thereof - and yet this is where you guys go
768412791795486720 2016-08-24 11:41:00 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mikeysmith @MirrorPolitics real talk, I'm as against Corbyn as the next fellow but this story is a massive waste of time
767496182289530881 2016-08-21 22:58:43 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Real lols at people on my Facebook calling Khan a Murdoch Blairite

760529478430982145 2016-08-02 17:35:32 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> getting hard to feel sympathetic for DC considering some of the comments from fans on Twitter and Reddit... #SuicideSquad
760519310787878912 2016-08-02 16:55:08 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @IanDunt Oh sure, no doubt. And like I said, "kinda". Not the same as a female terminator which they've definitely never done before shut up
760515092505034752 2016-08-02 16:38:22 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @IanDunt in terms of human badass/human-needing-to-be-saved, wasn't T2 kiiiiinda this in the first place?
760511958147854336 2016-08-02 16:25:55 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @flashboy Or they just said they did to fuck with the pollsters. I call it the "troll gap"
760414324703756288 2016-08-02 09:57:57 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Good that he apologised but considering sheer talent of Marvel's producers, directors, cast and crews, David Ayer hardly had leg to stand on
760236380358344704 2016-08-01 22:10:52 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> who the fuck takes an hour-long bath at 11pm on a Monday night I just want to brush my teeth and go to sleep goddamnit fucking damn hells

759870832134885377 2016-07-31 21:58:18 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ManMadeMoon @brettinthecity @daddyschoice just the sheer scale, effort and time put into it. Incredible example of investigate journalism
759867470005972992 2016-07-31 21:44:57 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ManMadeMoon @brettinthecity all you need to do is look into how the Panama Papers scandal was uncovered to see that this isn't true

759798917609381888 2016-07-31 17:12:32 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Not enough people talk about Trump's weird ass speech impediment. What's up with that? Why does he speak like that?
758996170509131776 2016-07-29 12:02:43 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> "I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird." "Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything."
758989000044531712 2016-07-29 11:34:13 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I have no issue with that. It's pointless, yeah, but it's actually a protest vote. Going for Trump is literally fucking insane.
758936364322652161 2016-07-29 08:05:04 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> sigh sigh sigh emoji emoji emoji   If you wanna see how real privilege can be dangerous look right here
758936216842547201 2016-07-29 08:04:29 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> and they think Trump is better than that, even though he isn't, because they can afford to. It's not them who'll be rounded up
758936084973707264 2016-07-29 08:03:57 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> they've just discovered that - shocker - mainstream US politics is corporate and corrupt. When it ALWAYS HAS BEEN FOREVER
758935924512202752 2016-07-29 08:03:19 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> nor is he a protest vote or a viable alternative. He's the fucking end of the USA. And these idiots go for him because...
758935700133687296 2016-07-29 08:02:25 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> young white affluent people choosing Trump over Clinton because they wanted Bernie. And don't realise that Trump isn't revenge vote
758935350467190785 2016-07-29 08:01:02 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> it's so easy to stick to your political principles 1000% when you won't be the one who'll suffer, isn't it?

757887414895570945 2016-07-26 10:36:55 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Who do I vote for if I think Corbyn is sending us to oblivion but I also despise Owen Smith?

757880137677414400 2016-07-26 10:08:00 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I truly, firmly believe that history will see the Baby Boomers, in the UK and US, as the most hated generation.

757697105637085189 2016-07-25 22:00:41 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @KingdomOfTheEgo on an entirely related note, Hemingway's depictions of romantic encounters in his early writing are kiiiiinda clunky innit

756505595394613248 2016-07-22 15:06:03 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> don't have time to argue this right now but shocked anyone can look at him and see anything but a danger, even if unintentionally
756505226052562944 2016-07-22 15:04:35 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> it's not even close to being as simple as you're making it out to be. He's an aggravator.
756505123032068096 2016-07-22 15:04:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> don't even begin to think that it all stems from one review. His ENTIRE usp is riling up trolls into attacking people
756504994082385921 2016-07-22 15:03:40 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> NOT about free reign to be an arse. Chat shit get shut down. Private company can do what it likes
756504799487680512 2016-07-22 15:02:54 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> the guy was a dick who riled up and encouraged hate speech. Free speech is about government not persecuting you for what you say
756504361828749312 2016-07-22 15:01:09 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> agree that banning speech like this is not the way, but Twitter is a private platform and can do what it likes. Conservatism, that
756503855760809984 2016-07-22 14:59:09 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> fostering a hateful environment through encouragement is easily as bad as actually harassing   You're cleverer than this
756503670230028289 2016-07-22 14:58:24 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> oh stop it. You know as well as anyone else that direct action is not the only way to stir up hatred. Far more complex than that

752219329731694592 2016-07-10 19:13:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I am supporting Portugal because I am in Portugal and don't want to get stabbed
752199434272960512 2016-07-10 17:54:54 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @KingdomOfTheEgo I'm just not certain the producers' intentions are really that noble. They rarely are.   Hope someone is reading all this
752199083218132992 2016-07-10 17:53:31 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @KingdomOfTheEgo and if it does do well and kickstarts a trend of female-led Hollywood films, it being a cash-in won't really matter anyway
752198904393990144 2016-07-10 17:52:48 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @KingdomOfTheEgo but maybe I'm wrong and the film is more nuanced and clever than it looks and actually will do some good
752198418999701504 2016-07-10 17:50:52 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @KingdomOfTheEgo I'd not feel this uncertainty if I had more confidence that the film isn't a flagrant money grab - reboot of 80s film innit
752198190259109888 2016-07-10 17:49:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @KingdomOfTheEgo on the one hand the concept is fantastic but on the other, Hollywood cares more about money than doing good
752197726247456768 2016-07-10 17:48:07 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @KingdomOfTheEgo I'm honestly asking because I don't know
752197647109332992 2016-07-10 17:47:48 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Is Ghostbusters a genuine attempt to champion the idea of more female-led blockbusters, or is it just trying to make money out of feminism?
752188799439036417 2016-07-10 17:12:39 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @hrtbps @LouiseMensch can't wait for the day someone hacks her Twitter and deletes her account

751967059018383360 2016-07-09 02:31:32 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ArcadeFireTube dead convincingly enough that a bunch of crew came out to check on him
751966960427102208 2016-07-09 02:31:08 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ArcadeFireTube @ArcadeFiretube periscope might be able to confirm this but I think Will lied on the floor for the end of Rebellion and played

749208217255833604 2016-07-02 11:48:53 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle It makes incredibly salient points about the whole affair, but you're so dug in to your view that you ignore it.
749208126071635968 2016-07-02 11:48:31 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle "No, I won't read this extensive argument against what I am saying"  Absolutely incapable of seeing the other side.

749207249160208384 2016-07-02 11:45:02 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle Unchecked capitalism leads to disaster just as unchecked socialism does. THAT is what history shows.
749207149843214336 2016-07-02 11:44:38 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle It's not an absolute. Total socialism doesn't work. Hence why I'm a SD. But its influence *is* necessary.
749207065084719104 2016-07-02 11:44:18 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle Socialism is the reason we have the NHS, labour laws, workers' rights, unions, human rights...
749206754307825664 2016-07-02 11:43:04 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle Oh, this argument again. Read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4qqzyb/its_not_undemocratic_to_resist_the_brexit_result/

749205468766146560 2016-07-02 11:37:57 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle Either you don't know what socialism means or you don't know what democracy means. Not mutually exclusive, you know.

749204268465487872 2016-07-02 11:33:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @shera_simpson @Windahl Quite. People who could benefit duping the easily-swayed with rhetoric and hatred. It happens.
749204054862139392 2016-07-02 11:32:20 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle Happy to wait a few years and return to this. In the mean time, maybe work on your condescending tone.
749203913979682816 2016-07-02 11:31:47 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle They don't sell. They rent, or keep the properties empty. It'd be nice if you were right, but you won't be.
749202755466760192 2016-07-02 11:27:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle *Nobody* in London can buy property except the super rich and foreign investors. Buyer's Market not remotely likely
749202362506612736 2016-07-02 11:25:37 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @shera_simpson @Windahl The narrative of Leave that it was anti-establishment was the most audacious and ridiculous of all.
749202218226683904 2016-07-02 11:25:02 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle P.S. "Buy property"? Oh, just buy it? Just like that? I don't think you know how London works.

749201079464763392 2016-07-02 11:20:31 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle All my point was that this notion that people marching today are "rich" or "elite" is absolutely absurd
749201057180479488 2016-07-02 11:20:26 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Holbornlolz @74bungle Yeah. And before you go where I see where you're going - thinking Brexit will lead to either is naive to the extreme

748834508238163968 2016-07-01 11:03:54 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> so Avalanche's 'The Noisy Eater' on Wildlfower is basically just Superfast Jellyfish, right?
748810773284007936 2016-07-01 09:29:35 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Maybe everyone should take the day off politics today and have some ice cream or something
748631514276061184 2016-06-30 21:37:16 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Oh, so that's why I never write at home #ShutUpShutUpShutUp
748614539936157697 2016-06-30 20:29:49 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> fuck me what the fuck jesus christ what the hell god what jesus fuck #ForWhomTheBellTolls
748577539321376768 2016-06-30 18:02:47 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @AP so HYDRA basically
748519073961615360 2016-06-30 14:10:28 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @jimwaterson someone go get Livingstone
748516946069561344 2016-06-30 14:02:01 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Yephttps://twitter.com/qikipedia/status/748515508497055744
748501006628061184 2016-06-30 12:58:41 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @scottEweinberg uh, trump
748492594951389184 2016-06-30 12:25:15 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I've got the perfect name for when @angelaeagle @hilarybennmp etc start their own centrist party: New Labo-   oh hang on
748471513314115584 2016-06-30 11:01:29 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Guys real talk I just wanna say I've loved this last week in political news. I mean it's awful but let's face it's been pretty fun sort of
748471196849672192 2016-06-30 11:00:13 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> BORIS TWITTER MELTDOWN COMMENCES
748470933179015168 2016-06-30 10:59:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Wow
748463176245706752 2016-06-30 10:28:21 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> So we've gone from the train coup episode of the Thick of It to the Spinners and Losers episode
748249131051802624 2016-06-29 20:17:49 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf literally don't believe you
748248327293108225 2016-06-29 20:14:37 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf so you're drunk are you
748190473999745024 2016-06-29 16:24:44 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Corbyn isn't a breath of fresh air - he's the desperate last gasp as the waves overcome you  and there's a boat, like, right next to you
748184207080423425 2016-06-29 15:59:50 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> With tobasco sauce on a plate, proudly, if Corbyn ever wins a GE.
748183134844354560 2016-06-29 15:55:34 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> this guy cuddled me oncehttps://twitter.com/zsllondonzoo/status/748183001129877504
748182471586553856 2016-06-29 15:52:56 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Ratings I'm citing are Ipsos-Mori. Trust them frankly. Tbh happy to be proved wrong on all this but don't want to take the risk
748180122079997952 2016-06-29 15:43:36 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I know polling has been majorly off lately but if he can win an election with a -25 approval rating I will eat my own face off
748179875434008577 2016-06-29 15:42:37 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Yes. So would you, I expect. As would the good ol' bubble. But do you *really* think everyone else will? Seriously?
748179113068863488 2016-06-29 15:39:35 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> fact is we can cling to ideology and hope because we can afford to but if the Tories stay in people will *die*
748179004751024128 2016-06-29 15:39:09 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> easy for people like us to say when we won't suffer most from another, harder Tory government
748178788668833792 2016-06-29 15:38:18 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> well let's see if we're thinking "oh at least we gave him a shot" when it's 2020 and Boris has literally destroyed everything
748178365199319040 2016-06-29 15:36:37 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> it's very shitty that this has failed, but the truth is that pushing politics to the left cannot be done out of power
748178220109922304 2016-06-29 15:36:02 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> after which he'll have to resign anyway. Unless they honestly think he can win, which is beyond absurd now
748178138379739136 2016-06-29 15:35:43 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> the impression I'm getting is that Corbyn and his supporters are willing to hang on at the cost of the election. Disastrous
748178004262682624 2016-06-29 15:35:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> What was the alternative? Asking him nicely? Waiting for him to fail in a GE and resign himself? The latter means Tory govt
748177268510429184 2016-06-29 15:32:15 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I'd also argue that the real harm here is staying on in office at the risk of the good of the country
748177114415960066 2016-06-29 15:31:39 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> With membership as rabid as it is, reconciliation promises will be made. Hard left will become soft left, but left nonetheless
748176082722033664 2016-06-29 15:27:33 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> because to me an Eagle govt with a leftist influence from the membership/unifying cabinet members is far pref to Boris til 2021
748175898155814912 2016-06-29 15:26:49 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> curious to know how you think we escape this mess, then. Under assumption we have a snap election in Autumn.
748174539603984384 2016-06-29 15:21:25 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> GE in Sept. Corbyn ratings at -25. If we had four years left I'd be all for Corbyn staying, but we don't. And we *need* to win
748174433123241984 2016-06-29 15:20:59 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> we were doing a damn sight better under Miliband than we are now. All the arguments come down to one thing:
748172933583998976 2016-06-29 15:15:02 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Angela "Could Actually Get Elected" Eagle  failing that I'm happy with Tom "Can Unify" Watson or even Dan "Not Corbyn" Jarvis
748167028578582528 2016-06-29 14:51:34 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> RTing your own tweets is the new liking your own Facebook statuses
748164764384264192 2016-06-29 14:42:34 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @HJBenjamin maybe
748122210225823744 2016-06-29 11:53:29 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @twlldun Totally on side with you over Corbyn but after a point is mean-spiritedness really necessary
748113277046120448 2016-06-29 11:17:59 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Is that @AngusRobertson mention of "Leader of the *official* opposition" a jibe? #PMQs
748112955154239488 2016-06-29 11:16:42 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I think that moment might end up being quite iconic https://twitter.com/jamesrbuk/status/748112742830186496
748111272458264576 2016-06-29 11:10:01 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> The fight has gone out of all of them #PMQs
748101858237919233 2016-06-29 10:32:36 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> reports now that Sarah Vine has been put in a rocket and blasted into space; unfortunately, the UK was also placed on board by mistake
748086466471936000 2016-06-29 09:31:27 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I'm actually in support of thishttps://twitter.com/bbcnews/status/748085366482173952

747911819155619840 2016-06-28 21:57:27 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I'm reading For Whom The Bell Tolls for the first time and I'm only eight chapters in but hey that Robert Jordan is a playa, isn't he?
747850870893711361 2016-06-28 17:55:16 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> low follower count means 'probably none' but will happily let you know if I hear anything
747846529902317568 2016-06-28 17:38:01 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @KingdomOfTheEgo He'd steamroll a GE but I'm wary of ex-military politicians, even Labour ones. Where on the spectrum is he?
747846320069709824 2016-06-28 17:37:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> can anyone tell me how I ought to feel, speaking from position of a social democrat, about Dan Jarivs? Voting record seems good but unsure
747843564143546368 2016-06-28 17:26:14 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @brightywriting it is literally only a bar. Tom Watson serves the drinks and Angela Eagle is singing at the piano
747838465933451266 2016-06-28 17:05:59 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Corbyn fanatic conspiracy theory bomb shelter begins here. Come on in, @brightywriting
747783514502860800 2016-06-28 13:27:37 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Now hearing that he has resigned from the shadow cabinethttps://twitter.com/georgeeaton/status/747782473296252932
747761786724683776 2016-06-28 12:01:17 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Pontifex morning popey
747761197127176193 2016-06-28 11:58:56 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @jimwaterson "Self-fulfilling" is clever. Gives them someone to blame if it all gets worse
747507420960784384 2016-06-27 19:10:31 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> that's why literally fucking everybody is going to Iceland
747402159310966784 2016-06-27 12:12:15 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> So Corbyn is basically Cersei right about now
747401489912578048 2016-06-27 12:09:35 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @PeterDavison5 Fifth Doctor not really putting up with any shit these days is he

747172406662471680 2016-06-26 20:59:18 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Hot take: Angela Eagle not resigning will play well to Corbyn supporters as she tries to keep the party together when she runs for leader
747147738324811777 2016-06-26 19:21:16 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> it does not
747146415349047300 2016-06-26 19:16:01 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @twlldun it's been a long day

747145848505704448 2016-06-26 19:13:46 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @twlldun can't even tell if this is a joke or not

747081679198687232 2016-06-26 14:58:47 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @christopherhope nice spin though
747081569182060545 2016-06-26 14:58:20 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @christopherhope the context is literally him saying that Labour leaders should be able to stand in muddy fields listening to bands
747068890379919360 2016-06-26 14:07:57 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @mrchrisaddison literally just finished watching that episode because of today's events. Spot on
747058134317928448 2016-06-26 13:25:13 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> don't want to jinx anything but I think this is about the time when Ken Livingstone usually shows up
747048745632698368 2016-06-26 12:47:55 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I'd honest to god take fucking Westeros over this shit
747042254624264192 2016-06-26 12:22:07 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @jimwaterson you seem to be trying to use Microsoft Word to message people which might explain the lack of response
747041203909197824 2016-06-26 12:17:57 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> someone tell Corbyn not to offer Ben Swain Shadow Chancellor
747040630086467584 2016-06-26 12:15:40 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> So today is literally that episode of the Thick of It where Nicola Murray's on the train, isn't it? #Labour #Corbyn #WatsonAtGlasto
747019917199872000 2016-06-26 10:53:21 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @PaddyConsidine Yep: http://tl.gd/n_1soquhe
746845341899755520 2016-06-25 23:19:39 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> If a freak accident puts Hunt as leader of the Tories I might actually fancy Corbyn's chances of winning a GE

746425267581747202 2016-06-24 19:30:26 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf @NicoHines yeah but isn't it a little bit exciting that we're witnessing the end of the UK and possibly the EU
746353309720657920 2016-06-24 14:44:30 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> can anyone tell me if the EU ref result would have been different had 16-18 year olds been able to vote?
746348764793798656 2016-06-24 14:26:26 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> actually imagine if in ten years the British Isles was made up of the Kingdom of England, the City-State of London, Scotland, Ireland and NI

723867333547180032 2016-04-23 13:33:15 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @InvictusNLP I actually have to admit, I can't tell the difference. I only complain about the change in taste because everyone else does.
723864963123687424 2016-04-23 13:23:50 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @InvictusNLP are you seriously telling me that you're okay with Kraft's recipe change
723863701422522370 2016-04-23 13:18:49 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @InvictusNLP I thought the reason this country is fucked was because they changed the recipe of the chocolate in creme eggs
723862073021702144 2016-04-23 13:12:21 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @InvictusNLP Sir, I'm afraid if you don't apologise immediately, I'm going to have to take this to the cyber authorities.
723860646236946433 2016-04-23 13:06:41 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @InvictusNLP Wow, that's offensive to PBFIVF (persons born from in vitro fertilisation). Please apologise.
723859009690841088 2016-04-23 13:00:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @InvictusNLP Kieron, buddy, what would your mother say if she knew you were spending your time getting angry at people on the internet?
723857405986091009 2016-04-23 12:53:48 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @InvictusNLP have a cup of tea and let some of that rage diminish, bro. Or you'll wither.

723832838618001408 2016-04-23 11:16:11 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @oldishrockchick Nice twisting of my words. All for #StGeorgesDay. Against casually-racist cretins using it as chance to crawl from woodwork
723828888355352578 2016-04-23 11:00:29 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @oldishrockchick if other Patron Saints Days had an overwhelming (and occasionally negative) presence on my timeline then yes, I would.
723826764645064704 2016-04-23 10:52:03 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @oldishrockchick what I said is applicable to literally every country in the world
723826549946998784 2016-04-23 10:51:12 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @oldishrockchick obviously, I mean *any* culture, history and future, because I was talking about patriotism as a concept

723821458896596992 2016-04-23 10:30:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> patriotism: a love of culture, solemn respect for history and a desire to build a better future. Not flags and casual racism #StGeorgesDay

721270653228343300 2016-04-16 09:34:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @KingdomOfTheEgo tweets reading "*still patiently waiting for vanessa hudgens hq pics at coachella*" sum it all up, really

720568967690133504 2016-04-14 11:06:44 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Admiralowen @secretcinema an absolute joke.
720567379818868736 2016-04-14 11:00:25 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Admiralowen @secretcinema a joke. I guess we fought our way in. Good news is you didn't miss much. High budget haunted house then clubbing
720567065787109376 2016-04-14 10:59:10 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Admiralowen @secretcinema wait, you were turned away? we kicked up a fuss with management and (after having to wait ages) got let in
720566714157703168 2016-04-14 10:57:46 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Admiralowen @secretcinema but according to one of their actors on Twitter, the preview night last night was *less* strict on dress code
720566626794545152 2016-04-14 10:57:25 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Admiralowen @secretcinema an absolute joke.

720566137294057473 2016-04-14 10:55:29 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @Teri_cabe @secretcinema mandatory purchasing (18) of costumes to get in, boring, haunted-house intro, pre-film area was literally a club
720565189574336512 2016-04-14 10:51:43 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> This guy gets it. That's mandatory *18* costumes, by the way. https://twitter.com/AlexLeeDee/status/720559480497377280

717803829052497922 2016-04-06 19:59:03 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> such blatant guilt - "in future". Hardly takes advanced reading comprehension to see the implication therehttps://twitter.com/davidschneider/status/717800706984525829

715122843844026368 2016-03-30 10:25:46 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> always getting Wilt Chamberlain and Neville Chamberlain mixed up is a very real issue

714932917445726211 2016-03-29 21:51:04 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf or maybe it was ALL OF THEM AT ONCE #TrumpPresidency
714932838391537664 2016-03-29 21:50:46 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf or maybe it was salvia
714932799602630660 2016-03-29 21:50:36 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf I actually meant loco weed
714932265453797377 2016-03-29 21:48:29 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf or, y'know, whatever it might have been
714932205693313026 2016-03-29 21:48:15 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf I think you meant 2015 but I guess not knowing what year it even is is a side-effect of the betel nut that was laced in your G&T
714931258124603394 2016-03-29 21:44:29 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf technically yeah but frankly trying to follow Brexit factions is like reading A Song of Ice and Fire on a helter skelter
714930780221415425 2016-03-29 21:42:35 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf he's a UKIP MEP and exactly
714930402859868160 2016-03-29 21:41:05 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf speak for yourself, our most exciting recent political event was David Coburn's microphone failing on his Periscope this evening
714930120151183360 2016-03-29 21:39:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf genuinely not sure what the internet is gonna do once it's all over
714927485742407680 2016-03-29 21:29:29 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf I literally don't believe that this happened

713048337558147074 2016-03-24 17:02:26 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf @youngvulgarian frankly that's an insult to the tweet
713047991104499712 2016-03-24 17:01:03 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @NickyWoolf @youngvulgarian the tweet which defined a generation and a man who probably won't  poetry
712994692632289280 2016-03-24 13:29:16 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> okay I'm actually quite worried that Matthew Doyle chap had a Twitter-induced mental break
712738932228800512 2016-03-23 20:32:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Massive Tory on my facebook has blocked me from commenting on his statuses   Top lol
712652533626486784 2016-03-23 14:49:39 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> And not 'oh they're messing this up a bit' meltdown, a 'holy fuck the country is actually disintegrating' meltdown. #JuniorDoctors
712652335923773440 2016-03-23 14:48:51 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> 1 year of a Tory majority and we've got the NHS, schools, the Budget, disabled benefits and the EU in meltdown. Imagine 2019. #JuniorDoctors

712622363582537728 2016-03-23 12:49:46 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @bbclaurak It's not your job to editorialize.
712573172156133376 2016-03-23 09:34:17 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> That @shattenstone interview with Zac Goldsmith in the Guardian has him come off as positively Trumpian

712235452959485952 2016-03-22 11:12:19 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @sport_simon which is not how freedom of speech works. it doesn't mean people shouldn't be outraged at something, which you implied
712235288349839361 2016-03-22 11:11:40 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @sport_simon you disparaged the (totally justified, IMO) reactions of people to that tweet and cited freedom of speech to do so
712233511017693185 2016-03-22 11:04:36 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MobileJames @sport_simon @mobilejames point is that 'but I have freedom of speech' is no justification for being an absolutely horrendous human being.
712231769634955265 2016-03-22 10:57:41 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MobileJames @sport_simon @mobilejames Of course you are, but that doesn't make it any less asinine to go spouting off about 'freedom of speech'
712231179798319104 2016-03-22 10:55:20 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MobileJames @sport_simon @mobilejames As a so-called journalist, you should probably know this. In fact, I suspect you do.
712231095849328640 2016-03-22 10:55:00 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MobileJames @sport_simon @mobilejames Freedom of speech is the *legal* right to demonstrate freedom of opinion. Doesn't mean people have to like it.
712230977741914113 2016-03-22 10:54:32 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @MobileJames .@sport_simon @mobilejames Jesus Christ. Freedom of speech does not mean people can't be outraged at what was clearly an awful thing to say.
711939998711414784 2016-03-21 15:38:17 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @TheColcestrian a million people could sign this and Cameron still wouldn't even respond to it. No PM ever would.
711939655340572672 2016-03-21 15:36:55 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @TheColcestrian It's the PM's prerogative to call a GE. The *only* way this could work is if it somehow magically changed Cameron's mind.
711910726886105091 2016-03-21 13:41:58 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> why get involved with politics when you can click 'sign' on a 'call a snap general election' petition and feel like you've contributed?
711910462003220481 2016-03-21 13:40:55 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> not-so-hot take: e-petitions are contributing hugely to political apathy amongst the social media-using generations

705509234042081285 2016-03-03 21:44:43 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @porcelainraft Ficciones by Borges is one of the greatest collections of short stories ever. He was the master of the twist.

705474843861491712 2016-03-03 19:28:04 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> Sardines episode of Inside No. 9 is sublime. Genuinely inspired me to write something with lots of characters forced in a tiny space.

705182835058077696 2016-03-02 00:07:44 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @acsbaum this is exactly why ice-cream sandwiches immediately burst into flames when touched by female hands

704968773741244416 2016-03-02 09:57:08 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson it's an insult I believe. Like uninteresting or lame.
704813750956773376 2016-03-01 23:41:07 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson this is why I'm planning on eloping to Reykjavik   and so help me god if I get there and they're all saying 'basic'
704812911382958080 2016-03-01 23:37:47 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson Oh I know that one! I think it's a shortening for 'babe', as in significant other. And I hate that I know that
704807037063065600 2016-03-01 23:14:26 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @KingdomOfTheEgo p.s. go eat a jar of dicks, sickness
704806880103833601 2016-03-01 23:13:49 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson something something something on fleek
704806767478382592 2016-03-01 23:13:22 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> I know you're there, sickness. I can feel you crawling up my spine - in my bones. I know your game, sickness, and you will not fuck me
704750476844244992 2016-03-01 19:29:41 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> came to Radio 1 to hear a new M83 song, instead am being subjected to Drake, Katy B and the 1975  ???
704739387347738624 2016-03-01 18:45:38 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson thank goodness for context, eh? though I briefly thought I had missed out on some awesome new slang

704466918187601920 2016-02-29 00:42:56 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson they might genuinely not work - I think the lifespan of old gameboy cartridges is about 15 years
704459274722942976 2016-02-29 00:12:33 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson never even got the choice! Yellow stuck me with pikachu. Who was awesome in fairness
704457992079548416 2016-02-29 00:07:28 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson someone out there must be willing to shell out for a shiny charizard. A search through my childhood stuff might be in order

704453289031700480 2016-02-29 23:48:46 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson Jesus Christ. Pretty sure they made that many films too, horrifyingly. Probably more marketable than a tamagotchi movie tho

704444635419189249 2016-02-29 23:14:23 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson wonder if they make it to the end without starving to death or if the filmmakers went for the realism route instead
704444397178462208 2016-02-29 23:13:26 UTC <KingdomOfTheEgo> @ClaireLuJohnson oh my god, I feel like I've smashed through the looking glass at 100mph here
