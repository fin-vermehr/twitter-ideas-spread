971419857529946113 2018-03-07 16:18:36 UTC <Pra_xis> @radiowest ask your guest to define benefit. Seems like he has a pretty narrow idea that it applies only to getting a job. Aristotle may not help a person be a plumber, but it helps them be a better person and citizen.
969791890588450816 2018-03-02 04:29:39 UTC <Pra_xis> @jejohnson322 Reconnect with things I liked when I was younger: punk rock, old comics, and skateboarding (and Teen Titans Go!). Quality time with my kids helps a lot too!

941538518253289472 2017-12-14 05:20:50 UTC <Pra_xis> @1a Moore not conceding has no impact, correct? Its not like if he conceded Jones would be in the Senate faster, which could impact the tax vote...

890170846630760448 2017-07-26 11:24:03 UTC <Pra_xis> @NPR @MorningEdition @DomenicoNPR Newt's interview was a disgrace. Slinging crap, desperate for anything to stick. So glad you followed up.

837153993872678912 2017-03-01 04:14:00 UTC <Pra_xis> @NPRinskeep gorka always relies on two tactics: never answer the question and be a huge jerk while ducking the question.

775810072878325760 2016-09-13 21:35:09 UTC <Pra_xis> @stevensmcdonald much better than Glitter OR Glamour. Why choose?
763232818407157761 2016-08-09 04:37:38 UTC <Pra_xis> @Reelviews if you get a chance, it's great. Both for kids and adults.
763172165554278400 2016-08-09 00:36:37 UTC <Pra_xis> @Reelviews better than The Little Prince?

730574603286765569 2016-05-11 01:45:33 UTC <Pra_xis> @stevensmcdonald family is the best!
727928779767578624 2016-05-04 18:32:00 UTC <Pra_xis> @TheTakeaway pronounced "pier" not p-air. Odd South Dakota thing.
727655219660611584 2016-05-03 00:24:58 UTC <Pra_xis> @tamarakeithNPR much depends on where that word is hyphenated.
725518806068531201 2016-04-27 02:55:37 UTC <Pra_xis> @tamarakeithNPR "shills and drivel" would make a catchy rap song. Or grunge song.  At the very least, it's better than boring?
723563853540265984 2016-04-22 17:27:20 UTC <Pra_xis> @radiowest is a city nature? Based on what? Obviously based on a constructed idea of what nature and not nature is.

717846672164806656 2016-04-06 22:49:18 UTC <Pra_xis> @tamarakeithNPR maybe it needs to be subdivided. Best baked good, odd candy bar, etc.
717831384740462593 2016-04-06 21:48:33 UTC <Pra_xis> @tamarakeithNPR best local food on the campaign trail so far?

693193703188357121 2016-01-29 22:07:12 UTC <Pra_xis> @nprobin any good hardcore recommendations? In our current, conservative, climate 80's hardcore and punk seem more relevant than ever!
