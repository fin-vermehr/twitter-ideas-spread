969670904576913408 2018-03-02 20:28:53 UTC <mairajohn> as a capricorn, I get embarrassed when I get pushed by the wind. even tho I understand mother nature is mighty and all powerful, my ego is bruised. one time during an earthquake I walked out at a glacial pace bc my coworkers panic/running 4 their lives gave me second hand cringe.

967133043180883968 2018-02-23 20:24:20 UTC <mairajohn> & then my husband drove for uber for like a year and ppl were always amazing jerks to him and then uber itself is an evil corp. so basically in this debate, the drivers always lose.
967132613025640449 2018-02-23 20:22:38 UTC <mairajohn> I guess I'm biased bc my dad broke his back driving a cab for over 20 years for a thankless bunch who love talking shit about someone driving them to and from their destinations. if u hate it so much, WALK.
967132209391030273 2018-02-23 20:21:01 UTC <mairajohn> definitely judging ppl based on how they treat their uber drivers is the new watching how ppl treat their servers/waiters.
