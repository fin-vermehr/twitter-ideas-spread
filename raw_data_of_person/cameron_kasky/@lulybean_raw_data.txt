951885061787303936 2018-01-12 18:34:18 UTC <lulybean> @speechboy71 @SouffleOfTheDay I totally understand this now. I was reading it as a choice to promote war vs promote slavery, not that the North and South went to war because of slavery.  Yes.  I understand the civil was was about the south fighting to keep black people enslaved.

951699809148182529 2018-01-11 06:18:10 UTC <lulybean> @speechboy71 @SouffleOfTheDay Haven't talked to him since last time I visited and he warned me about going to the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, because hoards of black people were randomly attacking white people. It was an antifa thing, he read all about it on facebook.
951699269362188288 2018-01-11 06:16:02 UTC <lulybean> @speechboy71 @SouffleOfTheDay Don't know what was over slavery means. But after Charleston, when is should have been clear it was a symbol of hate, he defended it by saying it represents his heritage. And I replied, but you're from Pennsylvania. Then he stormed out of the room.
951698592602845184 2018-01-11 06:13:20 UTC <lulybean> @ldforry @_Trump_2020_ You are correct, I am in a shithole country. Reagan is roiling in his grave, he was virulently anti Russia.

Everything offensive thing trump said meant nothing to him. The confederate flag is not racist, it represents his heritage. He's from PA.

951656288991113217 2018-01-11 03:25:14 UTC <lulybean> @realDonaldTrump That's a lie.  But I thought if it was released it would make the DNC look really bad - that's what your people told me.
951655031052189696 2018-01-11 03:20:14 UTC <lulybean> @JeffFlake My mother would be consider a low-skilled immigrant.  Worked 3 jobs to raise two successful children by herself.   We are fully American, we pay more taxes than that president, and we contribute to our communities.
951654107713978368 2018-01-11 03:16:34 UTC <lulybean> That president makes me cry almost daily; but @donlemon helps me feel better.  I love @donlemon!

951651597456621568 2018-01-11 03:06:36 UTC <lulybean> @KimberlyEAtkins My low-skilled immigrant mother came here and raised 2 successful American, taxpaying citizens on her own. She worked 3 jobs and we were subsidized with public housing and welfare. America has received a great return on her investment. Sorry this is no longer true for so many.
951650584343453696 2018-01-11 03:02:34 UTC <lulybean> @marcorubio If we did that; I wouldn't be here.  I'm fully American, successful, and I pay a lot in taxes.  There are lots of contributors like me whose 1st generation parents were proud to raise their kids as Americans.  Shame on you.

She won't meet her yearly deductible unless something goes majorly wrong and then it resets at the new year. I don't think she goes to the doctor because of it.  It's frustrating.

In my opinion as long as health care is a for profit enterprise beholden to stock holders it won't get better.
951598228335570944 2018-01-11 23:34:32 UTC <lulybean> @GOP @stevenmnuchin1 @ProudMomOf_9 @gorkaotz @soblessed1962 @krisopmsc @JudsonMcCulloch The concessions were made in hopes of getting republican votes.  Most of the ACA is a rehashed republican plan, used by Mitt Romney in MA and written by the Heritage Foundation as an alternative to Hilary's plan in the Clinton years.

She's actually trying to figure out how to get on the states ACA exchange because it would be cheaper, but seems she can't if employer provides insurance.
951596781434843137 2018-01-11 23:28:47 UTC <lulybean> @stevenmnuchin1 @puda_sheilam @JudsonMcCulloch And, they told my friend they looked into switching carriers, but it wasn't going to be worth it.  It really is ludicrous people pay so much for insurance before they even get to the health care portion.
951595926233083904 2018-01-11 23:25:23 UTC <lulybean> @stevenmnuchin1 @puda_sheilam @JudsonMcCulloch I have a friend with the same issue. She's single. Her company says they pay 50%. Her premium for the high deductible insurance went up to $380/mo. I honestly don't know how people with families manage this. I'm very lucky to work for a company that provides good benefits.

As long as health care is provided by for profit insurance companies and with no mandate they will continue to rise at unaffordable rates.

For profit insurance companies have no incentive to give us a break. With no mandate and so much uncertainty, they will continue to rise at astronomical rates.

Then Bannon said Trump is a great man on his radio show last night. Then this morning Trump said, Bannon said I was a great man last night. So Trump is bragging that a crazy person likes him.

I kept thinking was why is anyone talking to this douche like he matters. He was so irritating, kept thinking he had one up'd @sruhle somehow because he said the author had an unattractive intellect.

948373001828941830 2018-01-02 01:58:38 UTC <lulybean> @realDonaldTrump Have I been mistaken for all these years? I thought the root of the problem was who gets Jerusalem. If the US gave Jerusalem to Israel, I don't think that solves it.
948370625353011200 2018-01-02 01:49:11 UTC <lulybean> @realDonaldTrump @desbudesheim Could also be the stress of knowing all his assets could be taken by the government when he goes to prison.
948370350294802432 2018-01-02 01:48:06 UTC <lulybean> @realDonaldTrump @desbudesheim ?? Could be, who knows, guess we'll have to wait until they are fully transparent and release the results of his physical this year.

948347331342082048 2018-01-02 00:16:37 UTC <lulybean> @GOP This is just sad. The GOP has fallen so far. You use to try to make intellectual arguments. Now you just support the delusions of a senile old man. It's very sad to see where the proud party of Reagan has gone.

948308497581662208 2018-01-02 21:42:19 UTC <lulybean> @GOP @joe_jo075223 No thank you.  I'm not a virulent racist, neo nazi or fascist and I'm not ok with it either.  Factually, you did not create more jobs and you did not renegotiate better trade deals. Deleted the Obamacare mandate raises insurance costs for everyone and ISIS has not been crushed.
948300447839936512 2018-01-02 21:10:19 UTC <lulybean> @kylegriffin1 I bet god tells her yes. Then, I bet she loses miserably.

948036098432819200 2018-01-01 03:39:54 UTC <lulybean> @KQED The fine for smoking, eating and playing loud music on public transit should be increased, imo! But, I'm ok with the decrease, if they enforce it. I've never once seen it enforced. Even when people smoke or play music on the bus - how hard would that be @actransit?
948012599265837056 2018-01-01 02:06:31 UTC <lulybean> @barry_corindia Maybe that's part of the reason this millionaire was replaced by @RepDonBeyer 3 years ago?
948010715004125184 2018-01-01 01:59:02 UTC <lulybean> @GOP I think the people in your camp already know how to hate anyone who is not rich or white.  No training necessary.
947973080139177985 2018-01-01 23:29:29 UTC <lulybean> @MotherJones YES!
947972770926694400 2018-01-01 23:28:15 UTC <lulybean> @nytimes These people are supposed to feel alienated by the establishment and society.  I wish they'd retreat back into their scumy dark caves instead of having our media spend so much time trying to understand and relate to them.
947962393958563840 2018-01-01 22:47:01 UTC <lulybean> @desbudesheim @MegWildt  Just came across this @Trump_Regrets 
947958364952133632 2018-01-01 22:31:01 UTC <lulybean> @HeerJeet I'm worried this is a vision of things to come. Severe weather is getting worse and the deficit is getting bigger. I'm worried PR and VI are a test for what Americans are willing to tolerate for future environmental catastrophes.
947956830088544257 2018-01-01 22:24:55 UTC <lulybean> @BWJones Loved this gem!  But it left me hoping Istanbul gets serious about a trap/neuter/release program.
947955296000811008 2018-01-01 22:18:49 UTC <lulybean> @greenpeaceusa Will do. I'll send it to the organizer too. I carry a small trash bag with me on my daily walks around Lake Merritt in Oakland. Today, for some reason, the biggest culprit was Gatorade bottles.

947244589143883777 2017-12-30 23:14:43 UTC <lulybean> @Walldo I think it's gonna be just fine in Oakland.  Oakland prepared and it's not really going to change anything on the consumer side except maybe slightly higher taxes and less potent edibles.  And no wasting half a day once a year to get a "medical card" if you use one.
947228870452789249 2017-12-30 22:12:16 UTC <lulybean> @juliaioffe @SteveSchmidtSES @BrooklyneseS Agree.  At this point I see the entire @GOP as being complicit and guilty of allowing a hostile foreign power to lead our government.

947226591314067456 2017-12-30 22:03:12 UTC <lulybean> @greenpeaceusa I participate in organized waterway cleanups 2x a year, and the chip bags are by far the most common item I gather.  I think it's because they are so light and can easily be carried by the wind.
947221539342008320 2017-12-30 21:43:08 UTC <lulybean> @juliaioffe @SteveSchmidtSES But will anything come of this? Will there be any consequences for team trump for COLLUDING with the enemy in my lifetime?

944033687070392320 2017-12-21 02:35:44 UTC <lulybean> @SarahPalinUSA Do you regret posting shooting targets over the faces of elected representatives?  Did you regret it when one of them got shot?   You need to take some time to focus on your family instead of spreading falsehoods to rubes.
943984729224654849 2017-12-21 23:21:12 UTC <lulybean> @NBCNews @CNN @seanhannity Hannity, did you read the article?  Seems to work against your vendetta.  Also, I'm confused about your feelings for Russia, do you think they are our friend or enemy? This article would suggest they are our enemy, but many others you tweet say they are not. Please clarify.

You represent the American public - all of them, not just the crazy ones. The @gop is fully off the rails barreling towards the point of no return.

941173288251703296 2017-12-13 05:09:32 UTC <lulybean> @LJak07 It is. I worked on this issue in the 1990s. The last time they made a major push for ANWR. Clinton, with much effort from the people, vetod the legislation and kept ANWR safe. This is devastating on many levels. And it was so easy. In the 90s we had to fight hard to save it.

936827327610109952 2017-12-01 05:20:14 UTC <lulybean> @bluebirdsfly02 Thanks.  Is this also the one where they get to open the savings accounts before the child is born, for children they are planning on having someday?

936825137654939653 2017-12-01 05:11:32 UTC <lulybean> Did they just vote to give a tax break for unborn children; but deny a tax break for actual real children?
936822674474414081 2017-12-01 05:01:45 UTC <lulybean> At least most of these senators are really old. They're not gonna live forever.
936820930092834817 2017-12-01 04:54:49 UTC <lulybean> @brithume Yes. I think it would have been better if they at least read the bill that effects single solitary citizen and drastically effects our entire economy with the largest transfer of wealth ever  before they vote on it
936818187454132224 2017-12-01 04:43:55 UTC <lulybean> @muckrakery @SteveSchmidtSES I guess there's no real conservatives left in the senate
936816826649952256 2017-12-01 04:38:31 UTC <lulybean> @govtrack @seungminkim @Trader_Moe You're deluded.
936816583405592576 2017-12-01 04:37:33 UTC <lulybean> @BWJones When Dems do have the power they don't fight like the republicans. They are nicer. If most democrats weren't so wealthy, comfortable, or beholden to the same donors they would be fighting harder for us on this bill. This was too easy for the republicans. I'm my opinion.
936814992698982400 2017-12-01 04:31:14 UTC <lulybean> @govtrack @seungminkim They should try anyway. All Dems should walk out together if they get shut down.

936474233839935489 2017-11-30 05:57:10 UTC <lulybean> @passantino Depends on the type of conservative, I guess. The modern day ones seem to a least read the Breitbart headlines and whatever that war on information guy says. 
936473463019134976 2017-11-30 05:54:07 UTC <lulybean> @ByRosenberg Well is a good thing economically depressed cities are willing to give them there tax revenue. Looks like Amazon could use it 
936472210310537216 2017-11-30 05:49:08 UTC <lulybean> @SteveSchmidtSES @KMR31871 @wooltonparish @src77 I'm always amazed that people who have spent the majority of their working lives in public service as elected officials (on an average salary of 200k/yr) wind up as multi millionaires and it's rarely questioned.
936471208471625728 2017-11-30 05:45:09 UTC <lulybean> @SteveSchmidtSES I think they know who the are voting for (hint, it's not 'the people'), the what is inconsequential to most.
936470212244733952 2017-11-30 05:41:12 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @CorleoneRobby @odog333 Based on most of the tweets I've seen on this topic tonight; very few actually care about the facts, or got their information from a source that warped the facts for them.
936469559095070721 2017-11-30 05:38:36 UTC <lulybean> @passantino Sadly, few of the outraged will bother with reading more than a few words. Based on many of those tweets most have never read an article from a paper or site that average Americans read.

936455823605227520 2017-11-30 04:44:01 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @CorleoneRobby @odog333 You would do yourself a service by reading one or two article from a newspaper that millions of Americans read and inform yourself of the facts as reported in regular newspapers.
936455291138215936 2017-11-30 04:41:54 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @odog333 @CorleoneRobby I blame the officer for not following established protocols. Had he follwed what was required of him by law, none of this would have happened. But I'm one of those critical thinkers.

936450939946278912 2017-11-30 04:24:37 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @odog333 @CorleoneRobby You're gonna be really upset when the Russians take over.

He will serve time and be deported again. His life is ruined if and was probably never good, if that serves as any solace. This was a terrible tragedy and a terrible loss of a vibrant woman who definately didn't deserve to die.
936449190858670080 2017-11-30 04:17:40 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @CorleoneRobby @odog333 @lonelytylenoI The officer left the gun unsecured in a backpack in his vehicle, someone stole it then ditched it, Zarate found it.

936447360053395456 2017-11-30 04:10:23 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @KathySc65174870 I am 110% down for that! As a Californian, I'm tired of disproportionate representation and having my tax dollars fund states that can't compete in a global economy!
936446829943668737 2017-11-30 04:08:17 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @vishsf And he found the gun because it was previously stolen from a car where the gun was left unsecured by a law enforcement officer.
936446210147102720 2017-11-30 04:05:49 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @DrakeRickdrake1 I live here. Its very safe, but we don't want you to come anyway. But factually and statistically, sanctuary cities are very safe. Statistically, immigrants are far less likely to commit crimes than native born citizens.
936445613792673792 2017-11-30 04:03:27 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @CorleoneRobby @odog333 At least we can all agree this was a terrible tragedy and our thoughts are with the people directly affected by this senseless death.
936445177547300864 2017-11-30 04:01:43 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @CorleoneRobby @odog333 And his story was believable to a jury that saw and heard more evidence than any of us.
936444847875014658 2017-11-30 04:00:24 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @odog333 @CorleoneRobby My thoughts are not directed toward you Nunya. I believe we're both not approching this from an inherent prejudice against people trying to survive in this mad world. 
936444211997503488 2017-11-30 03:57:53 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @odog333 @CorleoneRobby All reporting in the newspapers the majority of Americans read, state that the jury was very thorough in their questioning and asked hard questions of the defense. The jurors, that judged all the evidence, believed the gun fired unintentionally and richocet off the concrete. FYI
936443427276779520 2017-11-30 03:54:45 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @odog333 @CorleoneRobby Why are you focusing on an immigrant instead of the unsecured gun that killed her.
936441709776461825 2017-11-30 03:47:56 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @odog333 @CorleoneRobby What was his history of violence?
936441598736457728 2017-11-30 03:47:30 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @odog333 @CorleoneRobby True but law enforcement officers doing their job correctly secure their firearm and do not leave it in the open for anyone to take. It's a big part of their job.
936433915585208320 2017-11-30 03:16:58 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative @odog333 @CorleoneRobby Did the enforcement officer follow the protocols perscibed by the law in securing his firearm?
936433627918770176 2017-11-30 03:15:49 UTC <lulybean> @GMconservative How did he get that illegal gun?  Fact says from an irresponsible gun owner.
936433369704841216 2017-11-30 03:14:48 UTC <lulybean> @brandongroeny Factually, he didn't murder her. Maybe that's why he wasn't found guilty of murder.
936433145104052226 2017-11-30 03:13:54 UTC <lulybean> @CattHarmony Actually San Francisco liberals are virulently opposed to all gun violence. Some much so we believe they should be regulated.

936424834669486080 2017-11-30 02:40:53 UTC <lulybean> @ARmastrangelo @mknpitbullmom Acutually, factually and statistically speaking undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crime and more likely to follow the laws than native born Americans. I'm more likely to be victimized by a white American male than an immigrant - factually speaking.

936368793743265792 2017-11-30 22:58:11 UTC <lulybean> @lisamurkowski Without CHIP or help or cost controls for healthcare, and with the cuts in Medicare and Medicade how much do they save?
936367855271940096 2017-11-30 22:54:28 UTC <lulybean> It's elitist to think its wrong for adult men to fuck children?  I'm an elite then.  Southerns you really need to think about where the Christ in Christianity came from.
936357357449240576 2017-11-30 22:12:45 UTC <lulybean> @BillyBaldwin When I was working on a campaign to protect Southern Utah Wilderness from mining and drilling; he got angry with us and said "take a picture and it will last forever." He doesn't care about the future.

936005177043308546 2017-11-29 22:53:18 UTC <lulybean> @indystar I naturally and rightly assume that of anyone who backs Moore.  @MooreSenate is more than a pedophile, he's also a white supremacist and is the embodiment of everything wrong with America.
936004045852028928 2017-11-29 22:48:49 UTC <lulybean> @jeremycorbyn I wish our AMERICAN government would condemn the far-right tweets by that man. They are abhorrent, dangerous and a threat to our society. But sadly, the most important thing to our government these days is taking as much as they possibly can from people who have less than others
935984909864153088 2017-11-29 21:32:46 UTC <lulybean> @markberman I still think that president inciting violence against people for walking around with color on their skin is a bigger deal.

935980190622154753 2017-11-29 21:14:01 UTC <lulybean> @GOP A reminder, we won't forget you propped up a deluded, verifiably crazy, racist white supremacist, so you could destroy the working class and America for tax cuts for your extremely wealthy donors.
935932289208541185 2017-11-29 18:03:41 UTC <lulybean> @HinaShamsi True.  But Bush was trying to stop people from being randomly attacked on the street because of their skin color.  Trump is actively promoting attacking people on the street because of their skin color.

930630487797727233 2017-11-14 02:56:13 UTC <lulybean> @joshtpm @portorium But aren't we already going through this whole thing because they have excess capital, and believe they should not have to pay taxes on it?
930616470823772160 2017-11-14 02:00:31 UTC <lulybean> @joshtpm @JustinWolfers @jessicastjohnNY @martylivs If they really wanted to help small business, taxpayers and main street. Seems to me rewarding companies that pay workers a living wage with a tax break would be good.
930615964240138241 2017-11-14 01:58:30 UTC <lulybean> @joshtpm No economist here...but it seems to me quarterly profits are more important than giving the working folks a raise or hiring more people for a lot of corporations.

913202647301263360 2017-09-27 00:44:12 UTC <lulybean> @MegWildt @desbudesheim He's completely off the subject.  He's all excited about his tax cut; like it matters because he doesn't even pay what he owes anyway.
913202118395383808 2017-09-27 00:42:06 UTC <lulybean> @MegWildt @desbudesheim This is worse than Katrina. He's knowingly, willingly allowing people to die.  UNAMERICAN.@SenJohnMcCain you could step us and save us again
913201735631597570 2017-09-27 00:40:34 UTC <lulybean> @MegWildt @desbudesheim Because POC live there and no electoral votes. If he gets away with this, it makes it easier to do it here for the next catastrophe.

912912550572019712 2017-09-26 05:31:27 UTC <lulybean> @jack I often wonder if the people that work at Twitter use Twitter. It seems like they don't.
912910331940343809 2017-09-26 05:22:38 UTC <lulybean> @jack It is not phone friendly. I am not going to scroll to read a tweet; that's what facebook is for. You are ruining the reason I twitter.

912836387472363520 2017-09-26 00:28:49 UTC <lulybean> @MelissaAmour72 Edits would ruin twitter. Imagine liking or retweeting only to have it edited to something you abhor.  The nazi's would do that.
912792851955798016 2017-09-26 21:35:49 UTC <lulybean> @jack I can use facebook for this.  140 characters is what makes twitter unique and easy.  I'm a stock holder and this will make me leave.

911825483301478400 2017-09-23 05:31:50 UTC <lulybean> Not a TV watcher; but I am gonna figure out what channels CBS and FOX are just so I can watch the big #TakeAKnee tomorrow.https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/911824703383207936
911823849204752385 2017-09-23 05:25:21 UTC <lulybean> @LCARS_24 @benwikler Maybe they've convinced/tricked themselves in believing the donors are the constituents.  Then all this could kinda make some warped sense.
911821672197398528 2017-09-23 05:16:42 UTC <lulybean> @MontagueSimmons @LeslieMac @SLMPD We pay the police to protect and serve us. Not to treat us as hostile combatants in our neighborhoods where we live and police don't.

911804830917656576 2017-09-23 04:09:46 UTC <lulybean> @Sifill_LDF I'm seeing it.  The only thing I can do and did do was report his violent, abusive tweet to twitter.

911783714668949504 2017-09-23 02:45:52 UTC <lulybean> @mikejoneswapo @ericwinston @redskinsfanstil Why do we equate the military and patriotism with football?

911446375396630529 2017-09-22 04:25:24 UTC <lulybean> @BishopSankey @IrishCARBomb21 Why do we have to associate the flag and military with the NFL?

911438549999685632 2017-09-22 03:54:18 UTC <lulybean> @netflix @daxshepard1 I didn't even know it was on Netflix!  I would've watched that.
911436839281508352 2017-09-22 03:47:30 UTC <lulybean> @SenJohnMcCain @GlennF @jimmykimmel Thank you!
911434039462043649 2017-09-22 03:36:23 UTC <lulybean> @mitchellreports @NBCNews So maybe McCain only did it because he hates you @realDonaldTrump as much as the majority of Americans do.
911431900144664576 2017-09-22 03:27:53 UTC <lulybean> I don't watch football.  Do you take a knee? If you don't, please take one this week in Solidarity!
911430554523807744 2017-09-22 03:22:32 UTC <lulybean> @ShannonSharpe @_Elle_Spencer_ Forced patriotism, Indoctrination! - I like that.
911425114813501441 2017-09-22 03:00:55 UTC <lulybean> @ShannonSharpe *why
911424784038109185 2017-09-22 02:59:36 UTC <lulybean> @ShannonSharpe I think EVERY player should take a knee after this! But I also don't know what the anthem and the military are associated with the NFL.
911417312510537730 2017-09-22 02:29:55 UTC <lulybean> @jemelehill Thank you for still exercising your 1st Amendment right.  Your voice is important.

911339019585425410 2017-09-22 21:18:48 UTC <lulybean> @GOP Taxes will increase, but deductibles, premiums and copays will go away. Overall less cost than for-profit and EVERYONE is covered.
911269988954189824 2017-09-22 16:44:30 UTC <lulybean> @desbudesheim @MegWildt I am going to apply to be Ambassador.  I'm completely unqualified, so I might have a shot.https://twitter.com/politico/status/911050682656051205
911049136455090177 2017-09-21 02:06:55 UTC <lulybean> @chrislhayes He would have never been nominated after revelation of stock purchases in any other administration.
911048460312260609 2017-09-21 02:04:14 UTC <lulybean> @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee You count the fact that he was surveilled in a criminal investigation as a win? The bar is mighty low.
911031865263448064 2017-09-21 00:58:17 UTC <lulybean> @LindseyGrahamSC @SenRonJohnson I rather we do what EVERY OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED nation has done successfully. Instead of having you constantly fucking with our health care.
910640169757270016 2017-09-20 23:01:50 UTC <lulybean> @DavidNakamura @DanEggenWPost When did they start vetting people?!?
910639812310310912 2017-09-20 23:00:24 UTC <lulybean> @everywhereist I used to think they only cared about babies until they were born. But @gop is proving me wrong. You must have the baby; but @GOP won't help
910625452263219200 2017-09-20 22:03:21 UTC <lulybean> @GOP @CharlesPPierce If you can't create profit, you are disposable and we don't want you. Is basically what @gop is saying.
910606663018848257 2017-09-20 20:48:41 UTC <lulybean> @POTUS @Franklin_Graham You're confused on who is righteous and who is wicked.
910299705761865728 2017-09-19 00:28:57 UTC <lulybean> @nycsouthpaw @ShimonPro So basically, if trump hadn't been elected, he would have gotten away with his crimes.
910248403682050048 2017-09-19 21:05:05 UTC <lulybean> @JohnJHarwood He is wrong. I want health care for everyone. If it has to come in the form if insurance, so be it.
910243269476585472 2017-09-19 20:44:41 UTC <lulybean> @AaronBlake And he would be wrong!  I, for one, want health care for everyone.  If I can only get in the form of insurance, it'll have to do.
910241520128798721 2017-09-19 20:37:44 UTC <lulybean> @codepink Killing people is more important than saving people.
910170643227750400 2017-09-19 15:56:06 UTC <lulybean> Apparently what doesn't work, is better than doing what does work for the @GOP
910170403879796737 2017-09-19 15:55:09 UTC <lulybean> @GOP Since we already pay the most for worst outcomes in the developed world @gop has decided our healthcare should be worse than the 3rd world's
909988842798641152 2017-09-18 03:53:41 UTC <lulybean> @nycsouthpaw Or a song @U2 ?
909966053282766848 2017-09-18 02:23:08 UTC <lulybean> @wish2bjen Not victim blaming either, but I am skeptical of her credibility. She certainly told some whoppers in defense of trump. I'm gonna wait & see

909964515135021056 2017-09-18 02:17:01 UTC <lulybean> @ReneeS1983 @desbudesheim @MegWildt I mean, what lawyer dies this, even if they are no rep'ing the PRES OF US?!? The incompetence is so deep.

909938695829995520 2017-09-18 00:34:25 UTC <lulybean> @vincentdonofrio He joked about the fact that he knowingly lied to us, while we were paying his salary. HE CHOSE to lie to us and the press every time.
909874363008192512 2017-09-18 20:18:47 UTC <lulybean> @fawfulfan This effects 300 MILLION of us!  Insurance companies will work to apply this to employer provided insurance too. + elderly parents, disabled

909578984601534465 2017-09-17 00:45:03 UTC <lulybean> @lzrchrt @MegWildt @desbudesheim @ReneeS1983 And you'd be investigated by the Secret Service and FBI! And HE'S demanding a firing and apology from @jemelehill!   I HATE HIM!
909577402673590272 2017-09-17 00:38:46 UTC <lulybean> @lzrchrt @MegWildt @desbudesheim @ReneeS1983 My guess this is either to distract from the "health" care bill, or bad trump news coming, and he's not right in the head.
909532003304800257 2017-09-17 21:38:22 UTC <lulybean> @Seanchuckle And donald trump.
909461805625253888 2017-09-17 16:59:26 UTC <lulybean> @desbudesheim @MegWildt & the juggalo's!  I had no idea!

909273557045207040 2017-09-16 04:31:24 UTC <lulybean> @POTUS @FoxNews If you don't see how racist this country is, you are probably a racist.
909271185585725441 2017-09-16 04:21:58 UTC <lulybean> @POTUS @FoxNews If you don't think @realDonaldTrump is racist, you're probably a racist.

908067216897306624 2017-09-13 20:37:50 UTC <lulybean> @HalpernAlex And I am very much looking forward to the day when people don't know what "bro culture" means.

902743426369597440 2017-08-29 04:02:59 UTC <lulybean> @MegWildt @desbudesheim Trump'll probably make them under secretary of education now.

902741885835288577 2017-08-29 03:56:52 UTC <lulybean> @flints1963 I remind myself of this daily!   I remember when we had a president and 1st lady who knew this too.

902699231663636480 2017-08-29 01:07:22 UTC <lulybean> @Pastor_Gabe I've received 5 different passages of scripture. Not one of them cites marriage as only between a man and woman.
902698829706694656 2017-08-29 01:05:46 UTC <lulybean> @Pastor_Gabe @greenpatchgrp That was my interpretation. It does not say marriage is only between a man a woman. I suspect there is not a verse saying that.

902667538127085568 2017-08-29 23:01:26 UTC <lulybean> @Pastor_Gabe Read it. Not getting the same interpretation you are. But thanks.
902633257191297024 2017-08-29 20:45:13 UTC <lulybean> @TheAVClub @Freeyourmindkid I recall @DavidMuir doing something akin to this during Katrina.  Hated him ever since.
902632633926111235 2017-08-29 20:42:44 UTC <lulybean> @Pastor_Gabe @voymasa I appreciate you not getting rabidly angry at me for disagreeing. I was curious as to what the bible actually said about it, now I know. TY
902631404311339008 2017-08-29 20:37:51 UTC <lulybean> @sfexaminer I do not understand how these people got so warped that, to them being opposed to fascism is a bad thing.   FASCISM IS BAD.
902629124761636864 2017-08-29 20:28:48 UTC <lulybean> @Pastor_Gabe @voymasa I read it, I'm not understanding it the way you all do I guess.
902622130688417799 2017-08-29 20:01:00 UTC <lulybean> @Pastor_Gabe Can you cite the verse in the bible where it says that marriage is a lifelong union between a man and a woman?

902350522367086592 2017-08-28 02:01:44 UTC <lulybean> @desbudesheim  As awful as this is. It's something that he did it when he did for the ratings.https://twitter.com/splinter_news/status/902350061954269184

902349686232694784 2017-08-28 01:58:24 UTC <lulybean> @ReneeS1983 @MegWildt @desbudesheim He might also be one of those that god talks too. God tends to forgive the folks "he" has personal conversations with.

901282180810199040 2017-08-25 03:16:31 UTC <lulybean> @GOP @JeffFlake I'd prefer the @gop did their job & enforced checks and balances on an equal branch of government. But I'm only a taxpayer, not a US Senator
901281165436305409 2017-08-25 03:12:29 UTC <lulybean> @POTUS @SenJohnMcCain If only the United States Senate were an equal branch of government  & could use their power to enforce some checks and balances on @potus.

901253018804396033 2017-08-25 01:20:38 UTC <lulybean> @jorgeramosnews And some members of @GOP would prefer he hadn't done that. Yet again, he did it, they will DO nothing about it.

899460761751138305 2017-08-20 02:38:51 UTC <lulybean> @SpeakerRyan I believe that if we are sending more young people into war in Afghanistan, rich people should pay their share of taxes to fund it.
899460455906779136 2017-08-20 02:37:38 UTC <lulybean> @SpeakerRyan I do not agree that millionaires should pay less in taxes than average middle class working people.

898982988729335808 2017-08-19 19:00:21 UTC <lulybean> @desbudesheim Right, it's an island nation.  Very hot, very crowded, tight living spaces...not exactly golden territory.
898982609526468608 2017-08-19 18:58:51 UTC <lulybean> @desbudesheim Sure, my landlord wouldn't have any issues with that!  Yes, outside.
898981779326984192 2017-08-19 18:55:33 UTC <lulybean> @desbudesheim But it's a great story.  Wonder why so many goldens in Taiwan?
898981358147559425 2017-08-19 18:53:52 UTC <lulybean> @desbudesheim No.  Not as long as I live where they'd have to climb up 10 stairs.  It's too sad to see them struggle with the stairs when they get old.

892591500990660608 2017-08-01 03:42:52 UTC <lulybean> And I use @lyft everyday.
892591377132822528 2017-08-01 03:42:22 UTC <lulybean> This is the most uncomfortable @lyft ride I've ever had.
892590821089857536 2017-08-01 03:40:09 UTC <lulybean> My @lyft driver is off the bay bridge and still bitching because I'm paying for him to drive me from SF to Oakland.
892590467652571136 2017-08-01 03:38:45 UTC <lulybean> My @lyft driver feels it would be more convenient, more comfortable and cheaper for me to take BART from SF to Oakland than to take Lyft.
892589936586539008 2017-08-01 03:36:39 UTC <lulybean> My @lyft driver is pissy because tonight it was more convenient for me to take Lyft home than it was to take BART home.
892589631048306689 2017-08-01 03:35:26 UTC <lulybean> My @lyft driver says in the future I should take BART to Oakland then take lyft from BART to home. He's pissed.
892589287761367040 2017-08-01 03:34:04 UTC <lulybean> My @lyft driver is complaining because I chose to take Lyft instead of BART. Even gave me directions to where the BART is.

892526163767156736 2017-08-01 23:23:14 UTC <lulybean> @MegWildt @desbudesheim I think it had something to do with their joints and arthritis???  Definitely not autism.
892516828588556288 2017-08-01 22:46:08 UTC <lulybean> @MegWildt @desbudesheim There is something to that but not because of autism. The vets stopped giving both Rocky and LuLu vacs when they were old. I forgot why.

881364624725032961 2017-07-01 04:11:16 UTC <lulybean> @deray @NRATV This propaganda is going to get people murdered. At this point, I consider anyone involved with the @NRA a deluded lunatic.

881290819877060608 2017-07-01 23:17:59 UTC <lulybean> @realDonaldTrump @adamcbest The gun nuts are having arguments about what went down in 1781 as some sort of justification; I think they want to take us farther back.
881290020727906304 2017-07-01 23:14:49 UTC <lulybean> @realDonaldTrump How the fuck, did this dud become PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!?!?

880503396612034560 2017-06-29 19:09:03 UTC <lulybean> @NRA @ChrisMurphyCT Don't I have the right to not be shot for disagreeing with insanity? What happened to "WELL REGULATED?" That's still in the 2nd Amend, right
880500437358567425 2017-06-29 18:57:17 UTC <lulybean> @L_MacAulay @JustinTrudeau Stop it Canada!  We know you have a sane person that likes people running your country. You're making America feel bad.
880490102367035393 2017-06-29 18:16:13 UTC <lulybean> @brianklaas Do I have a right not to be shot?  What happened to the "WELL REGULATED" part of the 2nd Amendment?

880463173354110976 2017-06-29 16:29:13 UTC <lulybean> @desbudesheim So we're totally gonna ignore that "a well regulated militia" part of the 2nd Amendment...https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/880402157589102593

875446907232964608 2017-06-15 20:16:22 UTC <lulybean> @andrew_lilico I agree.  It's disgusting that homes are left vacant while I have to step over people sleeping on the sidewalk!

874725459921063936 2017-06-13 20:29:35 UTC <lulybean> @realDonaldTrump @desbudesheim He also blocked @StephenKing. Apparently Presidents on represent the people they want to represent now.

874720518657646592 2017-06-13 20:09:57 UTC <lulybean> @brianefallon The democrats ALWAYS allow the republicans to make and set the rules.

874499014636339200 2017-06-12 05:29:47 UTC <lulybean> @megynkelly @RealAlexJones @dotcomhashtag65 @SeekWisdomToday He's nothing but pure and total darkness and that's where he belongs. There is nothing good in him.
874498710171811842 2017-06-12 05:28:34 UTC <lulybean> @megynkelly @RealAlexJones @dotcomhashtag65 @SeekWisdomToday He harassed the parents of murdered children. His followers harassed parents of murdered children. He made their most awful moments worse.
874497439713042432 2017-06-12 05:23:31 UTC <lulybean> @megynkelly @RealAlexJones I agree. You are an embarrassment to America. You need to be shunned from society.  No mainstream platform for your unnecessary vileness.

874493407254593542 2017-06-12 05:07:30 UTC <lulybean> @DarwinBondGraha They're "celebratory" gun shots. According to Friday's memo -- this is where gun culture has brought America.

874413953056595968 2017-06-12 23:51:46 UTC <lulybean> @joshtpm @gyost09 They're still wearing american flag pins.
874413740854198273 2017-06-12 23:50:56 UTC <lulybean> @GOP @joshtpm @jeremyzallen And @gop is still gonna call themselves constitutionalists and patriots while praising Reagan and destroying America.
874411170932719616 2017-06-12 23:40:43 UTC <lulybean> @robreiner IMO, the most corrupt in the history of all, former and current democracies. This applies to the republicans too. They have facilitated this
874410062722224128 2017-06-12 23:36:19 UTC <lulybean> @evansiegfried I don't think @GOP would. I think they'd make excuses for why he did it. At this point they are cult members with an evil agenda.
874407563277643776 2017-06-12 23:26:23 UTC <lulybean> @RepAdamSchiff I'm not confident the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP would be on board with that.  They seem intent on destroying America as we know it.
874393769092628480 2017-06-12 22:31:34 UTC <lulybean> @yashar This disgusts me.  But it's the deplorables world now...@NBCNews - shameful of you to allow this monster on prime tv.  He hurts people.
874392859188711424 2017-06-12 22:27:57 UTC <lulybean> @danharmon I feel we're leaning toward tragedy and I'm preparing myself for the new dark age.

874370234462883840 2017-06-12 20:58:03 UTC <lulybean> @chelseaperetti IMO, Not much of a comparison as to the reason why. One side is definitely operating on a deficit of intellect and a need to be vicious.
874358167504732163 2017-06-12 20:10:06 UTC <lulybean> @SenSanders I mean, this legislation only affects, EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN.
874357987363569670 2017-06-12 20:09:23 UTC <lulybean> @SenSanders @David_Quinones This would be a good move. @AssemblyDems @SenateDems Stop letting Republicans make rules for you to follow! You can make your own rules too.
874348800273334278 2017-06-12 19:32:53 UTC <lulybean> @AltStateDpt One way or another this affects 350 MILLION PEOPLE. We deserve to know.
874347114595209216 2017-06-12 19:26:11 UTC <lulybean> @igorbobic no, there's a lot of us and he's afraid of protesters. Plus, we're not really considered Americans by his people.
874345650170638336 2017-06-12 19:20:22 UTC <lulybean> @deborahturness @NBCNews Reminding everyone why we dislike @megynkelly. And Santa Claus in NOT white, period!

873249814787444736 2017-06-09 18:45:54 UTC <lulybean> @CNN @rezaaslan @brianstelter Done with @cnn. The pro trumpers @cnn are incredibly offensive. I wish @jaketapper would move to a better network.
873249383793295360 2017-06-09 18:44:11 UTC <lulybean> @CNN @rezaaslan @aravosis But they'll keep Jeffrey Lorde, Rick Santorum and others who I find incredibly offensive. I'll listen to @jaketapper; but done with @cnn.
