972502848301862912 2018-03-10 16:02:01 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CodyMatzFox9 I think that it probably causes a huge loss in productivity and people being late for work. Would be fun to see a big company share their data on this.

968654049108209664 2018-02-27 01:08:16 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @realmikecolter Once the teachers are all armed, the shooters will move on to easier targets, like the parking lot with full busses. Guns are the problem, not the solution.

967773915094421504 2018-02-25 14:50:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @cyvonne1229 They need those guns in case they need to overthrow the government. Even though they love the flag and they support our troops, they need to be ready.
967772281228480512 2018-02-25 14:44:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @krassenstein If the NRA had the opportunity to convince us that any of those occupations required a gun they would. They'd profit from it, so they most certainly would.
967652266453893120 2018-02-24 06:47:33 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DailyNorseman I guess as long as guns are accessible, bad guys will find a way to take advantage of these situations. Ft. Hood really isn't a great example for him to be using, I agree that he is using it out of context and leaving out valuable information to push the agenda.
967648865280249856 2018-02-24 06:34:02 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DailyNorseman In his defense,  he said they were highly trained, not that they are armed.

967022184794349568 2018-02-23 13:03:49 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @davidhogg111 Think how many new or returning members and donations they got. They absolutely love it.
966739754921406466 2018-02-22 18:21:33 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CBSNews @wwmayoremeritus I thought it was a mental health issue, they clearly aren't taking deterrents into consideration when going into a public place to kill as many people as possible.
966692004213248000 2018-02-22 15:11:48 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @mspfurnace We cant, because you're not worried about anyone's wellbeing, just your own selfishness. Can't give up your toys to help save lives. And of course they want incidents like this to happen, their membership is skyrocketing at the mention of gun control.
966688475750821888 2018-02-22 14:57:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AnushayHossain @shannonrwatts @JohnPalubski We shouldn't expect our police to shoot anyone either.
966687697992585216 2018-02-22 14:54:42 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AgentsofSHIELD @DoveCameron Same.
966687282416750592 2018-02-22 14:53:02 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @mspfurnace So you should donate to a mental health organization. You're literally giving money to people who want school shootings to happen. I mean, look, a tragedy happened and here you are paying them for it.
966462980115386369 2018-02-21 00:01:45 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @cyvonne1229 Maybe he's in town looking for a place to live for the next couple seasons 
966459354026332160 2018-02-21 23:47:20 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AP Kids will feel so much safer living in a prison camp, good solution.
966409838480814081 2018-02-21 20:30:35 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @realmikecolter Honestly, no place in America is safe when anyone and everyone has easy access to guns. Not schools, not churches, not concerts. #GunControlNow

966157085405843459 2018-02-20 03:46:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Mikel_Jollett @francesaldene @DJSchuette @MarlaCaldwell @dancingkelsey It would make the police safer, it would make anyone interacting with the police safer, safer neighborhoods, safer in church, safer on campus. The fact that anyone and everyone might have a gun doesn't discourage the violence,  it amplifies it.
966156473473609729 2018-02-20 03:43:48 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @THBrewery @ian_leonard Oh wow, looks like you got some top quality stuff there! prost!

965023227696369664 2018-02-17 00:40:41 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @kylegriffin1 We should have fixed the gun problem decades ago. We should have ended it after Columbine.

964944100742004736 2018-02-17 19:26:16 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @MuslimIQ Semi auto handguns have been a bigger issue for decades. I think the AR 15 style rifles certain appeal to mass shooters, possibly because it makes them feel brave and militant.

964523912221593601 2018-02-16 15:36:35 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @tarastrong @bigtoe215 @Browncoat4Life Legislators are responsible for doing their research and consulting experts, actors and random concerned people on twitter aren't. They can call them scary guns, and still leave it up to someone else to figure out which firearms are the most proficient tools of mass murder.

964508193513754624 2018-02-16 14:34:07 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @tarastrong @bigtoe215 @Browncoat4Life Most people aren't interested in your definition. We're talking about semi-auto with high capacity magazines. Can't blame people who don't have a gun fetish for not know all the terminology.

963904725526679552 2018-02-14 22:36:09 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @PrestonInTexas Cars are used for transportation,  what are guns used for?
963902541598773250 2018-02-14 22:27:29 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @Ryn0ceros The only thing we should be focusing on is access to weapons.
963902094909607936 2018-02-14 22:25:42 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @PrestonInTexas And without easy access to semi auto weapons it wouldn't have happened.

But honestly I'll agree that vikes fans are extra bitter toward packers, and I blame the fact that the twin cities is full of packers fans. It isn't just two games a year, we put up with them all year, our whole lives.

960245090202595334 2018-02-04 20:14:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikings @Eagles @NFL_Memes @SLPcaleb @packersinsider I've been going to games since the mid 90s and I've never seen any fans getting attacked while they were walking around. The twin cities is loaded with packers fans, and giving them shit for being traitors to the hometown team should be expected, that is normal for a rivalry.
960243038751739905 2018-02-04 20:05:55 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikings @Eagles @NFL_Memes @SLPcaleb @packersinsider When was the last time Vikings fans threw cans of beer at packers fans? Seems like we have a pretty normal rivalry and you're just butthurt that your team had a bad year.

956889065718198272 2018-01-26 13:58:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @EricTrump Why not just give tax cuts directly to the workers? Why wait for each individual employer to make that decision?
956748361637376000 2018-01-25 04:39:19 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @iceberglue I think it is because it had a huge audience and lasted for so long. It isn't as recognizable to folks who didn't watch it as some other series though, not as many famous characters (not saying that is a requirement for reaching epic status).

944395187996028929 2017-12-22 02:32:13 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DailyNorseman Case is a fraud, he pretended to be a backup, he is clearly a starter. He has all the tools, he can be a top 10 guy for several seasons on the right team. Biggest question I have is if it is the supporting cast or the offensive coordinator making it all work.

941465815408398337 2017-12-14 00:31:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Alyssa_Milano @1Cowboy4Ever Right, the laws allow us to hold them accountable.
941465159532466177 2017-12-14 00:29:20 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Alyssa_Milano We've made it easier, does that count?
941454243797532672 2017-12-14 23:45:57 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @FCC @amyklobuchar @HarbingerTruth @kingrcdd It's a safeguard to protect people, just because they didn't try to screw people before, doesn't mean they won't now. The rules weren't hurting anyone, they required no resources to simply  leave them in place. Only reason to remove would be to do the things the were preventing.
941441592610746374 2017-12-14 22:55:41 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @FCC @amyklobuchar @kingrcdd As we become increasingly dependent on the Internet, a few simple rules to keep it accessible for everyone are important.

941356534176669697 2017-12-14 17:17:41 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @IvankaTrump Except it hurts the people who need help the most. Don't pretend to care about American families.

941129959938183170 2017-12-13 02:17:22 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SkolMemes I wouldn't want to risk next season, they can compete for the wildcard without risking it.

940379265220128768 2017-12-11 00:34:22 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @misslunarcrow I'd let them know. There is certainly a chance that going to college and other things have changed them, they might be a completely different person now. Dragging someone now doesn't help anyone.

940035024694345729 2017-12-10 01:46:29 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Vikings lose. Eagles, Packers, Lions all win. Not what we had hoped for, at all.

930092015714492417 2017-11-13 15:16:31 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @cyvonne1229 @DylanSAYSS Easy excuse to make, or maybe any QB who was one notch above mediocre would have had a phenomenal year and we wouldn't be talking about a bad O-line. 9 games w/ < 200 yards, only 3 games with multiple tds screams mediocrity.

924355119596089344 2017-10-28 19:20:08 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @greeneyedbecky @thesciencerules @buzzman888 In no way do white lives not matter in our society. White people hold all of the power and have all of the privileges.
924354156260937733 2017-10-28 19:16:19 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @greeneyedbecky @thesciencerules @buzzman888 Brief def of BLM is their lives are don't matter to society, and their lives should matter, too. Not more than, just matter too.
924352216223404032 2017-10-28 19:08:36 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @EndingDroughts @LeesWarHorseJL @GenkiYiu Learn how statistics work, when the population is ~12% black but are killed by police at 3.

923922620185219073 2017-10-27 14:41:32 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AmazonVideo @Chaos2Raptor Oh for God's sake, they aren't protesting the flag or anthem, and they're standing up for people who lack a voice. You are dense.
923754869835657216 2017-10-26 03:34:58 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> He needed to pass to the cat. #ThursdayNightFootball
923693333452529664 2017-10-26 23:30:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AmazonVideo @Chaos2Raptor You realize that the protest is about police brutality towards people of color, right? It has nothing to do with the flag or anthem.
923686273231085569 2017-10-26 23:02:23 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AmazonVideo @Chaos2Raptor No, you can protest it. But if people boycotted your employer because it didn't stop you from protesting, that is wrong.
923685917860204544 2017-10-26 23:00:58 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AmazonVideo @Chaos2Raptor And what you're preaching is nationalism, not patriotism.
923685801023729665 2017-10-26 23:00:30 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AmazonVideo @Chaos2Raptor You're boycotting because someone is protesting, they're protesting because of systemic racism. Completely different.
923683256448487424 2017-10-26 22:50:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AmazonVideo @Chaos2Raptor Threatening a boycott is forcing them. It says, do it or else you'll lose revenue. That isn't the freedom our soldiers die to protect.
923660443499065344 2017-10-26 21:19:45 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AmazonVideo @Chaos2Raptor They died to protect the constitution and our rights. Forcing people to stand is fascism.
923659737069125632 2017-10-26 21:16:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AmazonVideo @MTravisMoore I agree, boycotting the NFL completely until police violence and racism is ended is even better than taking a knee!

917454407918391296 2017-10-09 18:19:10 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AnimeEyedGirl Thanks for the recommendation. There's just so much to choose from, hard to choose what to watch next.

917414654778978304 2017-10-09 15:41:13 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @keslinfinity He discovered the Bahamas, hardly revisionist history to say he didn't discover America. I mean, there were people here already, too.
917401070015598592 2017-10-09 14:47:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @levarburton @polymorph2 And he never made it to North America, he found the Bahamas on his failed attempt at a new route to India.
917395826913218561 2017-10-09 14:26:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HistoryVikings Well, there were plenty of people here before whatever group of Europeans we decide on...
917242790957940736 2017-10-08 04:18:17 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @JohnFugelsang Pretty sure you're talking about the same guy.
917236649356136448 2017-10-08 03:53:53 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @OmarKelly They won't be happy until those players are put in their place.

917148182639005696 2017-10-08 22:02:21 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @Cscott_05 I'm sorry to have steered the discussion in a direction you don't agree with. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day @studioflow.
917141812208390146 2017-10-08 21:37:02 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @dwenger1010 I don't think anything said here is "spewing crap" it is just debateable as to if they can protest when working, and if it constitutes work.
917141278181281792 2017-10-08 21:34:55 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @Cscott_05 @studioflow Right, that's what I've been discussing. Can your employer tell you to not publicly protest while you're working.
917140695344926724 2017-10-08 21:32:36 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @vett1_ Hopefully they players will take control, don't play for an owner who treats you like this.
917140455648833537 2017-10-08 21:31:38 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @vett1_ It's terrible that we're still fighting for the same things our grandparents were. White supremacy has deep roots and vast support.
917139739140153345 2017-10-08 21:28:48 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @mmoore1968 They most certainly are, they are in uniform, in the stadium. But they also don't need to stand.
917139161613602817 2017-10-08 21:26:30 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @mathdrama I doubt it too.
917138827457818624 2017-10-08 21:25:10 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @sl1nasty Hopefully we're not worshipping the flag, but if that were the case, hopefully we'd have the option to not participate.
917138148349698049 2017-10-08 21:22:28 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @vett1_ Civil rights still has a long way to go, the whole reason for protesting.
917137800792825856 2017-10-08 21:21:05 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @allyzay @Call_Tyrone_ I agree with you. I think Kaepernick found a great way to protest, while being respectful which nobody needs to regarding police violence.
917136894454063104 2017-10-08 21:17:29 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @BrianD048 @allyzay Right, and being at the game, and prior to the game at the stadium, during flights etc are in their contracts.
917136466530193413 2017-10-08 21:15:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @TamarandD I'd guess that using the office of VP to punish the NFL for allowing free speech is unconstitutional.
917136108408004608 2017-10-08 21:14:22 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @Cscott_05 @studioflow Didn't say that. The assumption is that they can tell them they aren't allowed to protest while representing their team in uniform.
917135780073607168 2017-10-08 21:13:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @Cscott_05 Right. Never said that.
917100903450243078 2017-10-08 18:54:28 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @Cscott_05 They specifically said that players aren't required to stand for the anthem.
917100517754572801 2017-10-08 18:52:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @jdubya688 That might be the case, and that would be a very different situation if proven true.
917100264557072384 2017-10-08 18:51:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @rantasaurus They asked to stand or not participate, as far as I know they were not fined for staying in the tunnel.
917099166056280064 2017-10-08 18:47:34 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @Poppy_Fields1 @allyzay Ally, if I'm told to attend a meeting, I'll be there. If I'm asked to not make a political statement on national TV, I'll ask my lawyer.
917098074664730625 2017-10-08 18:43:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow No, and it's too bad the players didn't still take a knee. I'd like to know what they were threatened with.
917092435355938817 2017-10-08 18:20:49 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @allyzay @Call_Tyrone_ I'm not here calling names Tyrone. I'm not debating if players should protest- I think they should, I'm discussing legality of owners action
917091428827848704 2017-10-08 18:16:50 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow I said within the terms of their contract. If they can prove it is conduct detrimental to the team, then they can say no.
917089700569067522 2017-10-08 18:09:57 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow Out of context eddie.
917088490730524672 2017-10-08 18:05:09 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @BlackEndowment Absolutely, and too bad their teammates didn't have their backs. I don't think owners should be taking this action, players should decide.
917088092418387968 2017-10-08 18:03:34 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @RevanTyranus They stayed in the tunnel, they didn't stand for the anthem. They didn't let them kneel or sit on the sideline during it though.
917087641815932929 2017-10-08 18:01:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BostonDamon Nope, and they didn't. They didn't come out to the field until it was over.
917087241008271360 2017-10-08 18:00:11 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @RevanTyranus The NFL doesn't require anyone to stand for the anthem, that much is clear. They also said they wouldn't fine anyone.
917084819300995073 2017-10-08 17:50:34 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @MrDarell1980 Listen, don't spend your time attacking people who support the same cause. Seriously.
917084351887704065 2017-10-08 17:48:42 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @kelly_rtsj You're racist for using language like that. And the protests have nothing to do with Veterans, it's about racist cops & equality.
917083556823871488 2017-10-08 17:45:33 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @MrDarell1980 The issue here should be regarding what teams should do, not arguing over what they can do. Players have a Union and Lawyers for that.
917082712493756416 2017-10-08 17:42:11 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @kelly_rtsj That's complete nonsense, not to mention racist.
917082346486222848 2017-10-08 17:40:44 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 @allyzay That isn't right either, they can't force you to do anything unsafe or illegal among other things.
917080833441325056 2017-10-08 17:34:43 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @BonafideMoney21 They're getting paid to show up to the game on time for warmup etc, so they are dressed and on the clock so to speak.
917079615654506496 2017-10-08 17:29:53 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow @RevanTyranus No, freedom of speech protects you from the government, not from your employer limiting your political statements while at work.
917078210847956994 2017-10-08 17:24:18 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @thanyouknow They're on the clock, their employer can make them do what they want within the terms of their contract.
917077728821686273 2017-10-08 17:22:23 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing What great teammates, they all should've refused when treating them like that.

915313656426098688 2017-10-03 20:32:36 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @2020fight @Joshstylegaming I absolutely agree. Right now with over 300 million guns in the USA, there's no telling who has them,  certainly no idea if they're fit.

909467601432203264 2017-09-17 17:22:27 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Rosenbergradio So the argument is that Kaepernick should be a backup or 3rd stringer somewhere? Case is a fine backup by the way.

905141511498731522 2017-09-05 18:52:07 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Mikel_Jollett @angiestweeting Is it because almost 100,000 dreamers are unemployed? Probably not, but you're deflecting. Education of current citizens is off topic.

898264725263228928 2017-08-17 19:26:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TonyDungy @GuvnaBill @PyschoCTsBack70 You do know that the parties have substantially changed in the last century.
898264024542064641 2017-08-17 19:23:27 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SeviriaCosplay Please take some time for yourself, I wouldn't want you to burn yourself out.
898252560905129985 2017-08-17 18:37:53 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SeviriaCosplay How much time off? Students are just moving into dorms at my old University today 
898247917294759936 2017-08-17 18:19:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @fatpinkmaester @vaculb @WizzardlyBear @GuvnaBill Tell us about what the Confederate army was fighting for, this should be good.
898247652671840257 2017-08-17 18:18:23 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @WizzardlyBear @fatpinkmaester @vaculb @GuvnaBill Not against our government. If you're loyal to some other country, keep talking.
898228254838054913 2017-08-17 17:01:18 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TonyDungy @vaculb @WizzardlyBear @GuvnaBill @fatpinkmaester A monument that remembers all those who lost their lives in the war isn't the same as celebrating a confederate leader.
898227660719087617 2017-08-17 16:58:57 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TonyDungy @vaculb @GuvnaBill @trialist2 They wanted to secede, have you read or studied the articles of secession? Losing slaves would crush their economy.
898213429466583042 2017-08-17 16:02:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TonyDungy @GuvnaBill There is no reinterpretation involved, and I'm sorry that slavery and treason don't mean anything to you.
898208285169520640 2017-08-17 15:41:57 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TonyDungy @GuvnaBill Big difference in context here. Confederate heroes are celebrated for their efforts to maintain slavery and divide the country.
898206764214169601 2017-08-17 15:35:55 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TonyDungy @krob60 It doesn't erase history. A statue is honoring and commemorating the individual and their actions.
898187431333294080 2017-08-17 14:19:05 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Alt_NASA @qz Wtf is Iowa doing building these monuments in the last decade?pic.twitter.com/aWDy5RuM2N

898038556282822662 2017-08-16 04:27:31 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @LindsLaBelle Let me know if you want to do a LotR marathon

897895718341533697 2017-08-16 18:59:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @realDonaldTrump It's okay to quit, you were losing, we understand.
897646544375214080 2017-08-15 02:29:48 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @KSTP @migiziwigwan So aren't you trying to stick up for the ones who killed someone?  Wtf are you even talking about...
897568268172615680 2017-08-15 21:18:45 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @KSTP @migiziwigwan Well both were practicing free speech, just say who you support.
897566910170181632 2017-08-15 21:13:22 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @KSTP @migiziwigwan The good guys and the bad guys, that would be two. Which one are you with?
897566652577009664 2017-08-15 21:12:20 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @KSTP @PineappleGun So when the Nazis rounded up Lesbians and gassed them, that was on the same level as protesting police violence?
897517210821959680 2017-08-15 17:55:52 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @KyleMcCarley More already? I'll get on it tonight!

897458079461244929 2017-08-15 14:00:54 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @lunarfei Pretty much anything goes.
897452821024456704 2017-08-15 13:40:01 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AniMiaOfficial We were so much smaller for one.
897444671508676608 2017-08-15 13:07:38 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @AmberThomasson1 @theMattad0R @MuricanPigDog It's funny, but not at all equivalent. They are our country's founders, not the treasonous losers of our civil war.
897444062860652544 2017-08-15 13:05:12 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @theMattad0R @MuricanPigDog Understanding you don't put up statues of our enemies who were willing to destroy America rather than give up their slaves to "remember".
897442909733085184 2017-08-15 13:00:38 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @MuricanPigDog @AmberThomasson1 @theMattad0R This conversation isn't about anything but confederate monuments, stop deflecting.
897442493654077440 2017-08-15 12:58:58 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @MuricanPigDog @theMattad0R So it's like a participation trophy?
897442163277144064 2017-08-15 12:57:40 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @MuricanPigDog @AmberThomasson1 You mean white southerners. Black southerners actually were victims.
897290034352705536 2017-08-14 02:53:09 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @sirena_cos @Nilkski_ I want those wings
897284452245786624 2017-08-14 02:30:58 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @MuricanPigDog I see you're just a troll, but why do you call yourself American if you want to continue celebrating hose who tried to destroy it?
897282784078647296 2017-08-14 02:24:21 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @MuricanPigDog We're not getting rid of history, we just need to stop celebrating the worst part of it. Those monuments should remember the victims.
897282141771452416 2017-08-14 02:21:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing Remembering is very different from celebrating. Take them all down.
897263290396618752 2017-08-14 01:06:53 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ComicBookNOW @WatsonsMusings I didn't ask about you, I'm talking about the majority of players. Not spoofers that saved up for a year.
897260049206317057 2017-08-14 00:54:00 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ComicBookNOW @WatsonsMusings People are already doing a dozen raids a day, they are definitely spending.

897246617191018498 2017-08-14 00:00:38 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ComicBookNOW @WatsonsMusings That doesn't get you an extra per day, people will want that special raid invite, they'll spend until they get it.
897227154752249856 2017-08-14 22:43:18 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CristinaVee @KaijiTang When will these celebrities learn you can't do this smh
897087141225914368 2017-08-14 13:26:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ComicBookNOW Just a money grab, forcing people to buy a ton of raid passes instead of using the daily pass

881914241720225793 2017-07-03 16:35:15 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SweetSpectre Yeah, I still have access to all of the psych journals and such, too. I'll have to dig into it sometime.
881912918236958721 2017-07-03 16:29:59 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SweetSpectre I should see if they offer it online, maybe they'd let me audit it lol
881912669808099329 2017-07-03 16:29:00 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SweetSpectre There was a sleep and dreaming course that I could never fit in my schedule, wish my university wasn't 80 miles away or I'd still take it.
881911262552215552 2017-07-03 16:23:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SweetSpectre I'm no expert in dream interpretation, but either way, I know how disturbing they can be. Wish I would've had a chance to study it!
881910057461583873 2017-07-03 16:18:37 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SweetSpectre I hope they don't come back, try to manage your stress and have time for self care (easier said than done).
881908063934042113 2017-07-03 16:10:42 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @StellaChuuuuu And food.
881907981666975749 2017-07-03 16:10:22 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @UncannyMegan Keep challenging yourself, takes many uncomfortable situations sometimes, but you'll build it up.
881907391561904128 2017-07-03 16:08:01 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SweetSpectre Sorry to hear that. They have a theme or just generally bad?

877224818550165504 2017-06-20 18:01:09 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Blizzard_Ent @mwpierson 15 for a new character isn't worth it, they should just give it to you. Desperate money grab for a failed game that couldn't do an expac.
877178560955527168 2017-06-20 14:57:20 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Blizzard_Ent $14.99 is enough for me to just go get a different game.

862039278603440130 2017-05-09 20:19:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikeologist I like sitting back in the 20s and watch the surprise on faces when we're 1st place.

861741078868787200 2017-05-08 00:34:18 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AniMiaOfficial I could buy a frickin mansion with that for a monthly mortgage payment.

861398333440524288 2017-05-07 01:52:21 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SinastriCosplay You try something like ortho home defense? Come in a jug with a built in hose/sprayer to go around the foundation around the house.
861397745105608706 2017-05-07 01:50:01 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AniMiaOfficial I'd worry about slipping in snow/ice on that driveway, especially if you travel and come back to a difficult mess that you can't drive on.

860176851024699395 2017-05-04 16:58:37 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Well at my age I was ready to move to safety, my corner days are over, way over

860171981001502721 2017-05-04 16:39:16 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ChloeAHenderson I hope they can get the special effects right, Agents of SHIELD gets it right, and the Netflix  shows have done a good job overall.

858812811862040576 2017-04-30 22:38:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> My take is that they pay their workers/management so little, and you get what you pay for. Inventory is off, ordering not done, etc.

858136207720579072 2017-04-28 01:49:49 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikeologist They know he is a very short term player, probably not much confidence in anyone on that roster.
858133633877594113 2017-04-28 01:39:36 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> I love 3rd round trades, too. #NFLDrafthttps://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/858133209296519169

858121224748240896 2017-04-28 00:50:17 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> The Browns might have their QB. #NFLDraft
858119835112394753 2017-04-28 00:44:46 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Mixon is definitely a mixed bag, hopefully he left his trouble in the past. #NFLDraft

858113510202585089 2017-04-28 00:19:38 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Goff struggled (to say the least) last season, adding a good TE should help take some pressure off him in the coming seasons. #NFLDraft
858111856120131584 2017-04-28 00:13:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @draftLogan Yup, real sorry 
858111532215005184 2017-04-28 00:11:46 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Big time value for the Eagles who pick (injured) CB Sidney Jones, he'll get healthy and be a great player. #NFLDraft

858105662273970176 2017-04-28 23:48:27 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Jets go with a DB, safety Marcus Maye. #NFLDraft

858104180002652160 2017-04-28 23:42:33 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Bills take Zay Jones, WR. Might see more offensive weapons go before all the dbs? #NFLDraft
858102797916614656 2017-04-28 23:37:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> I was expecting AZ to take a qb, instead they grab a DB, Budda Baker.  #NFLDraft

857806497782407169 2017-04-27 03:59:41 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DawnAtFOX9 I wonder if they'll move up or just take what is left, not a very deep draft for line, pretty big dropoff after the top guys.
857801807938170880 2017-04-27 03:41:02 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> 9ers going to take a qb here? Might as well, they would've done it 30 picks ago, too. #NFLDraft
857801161147076610 2017-04-27 03:38:28 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Very nice tribute to Dan Rooney by Bettis and Harris. Also announcing the selection of Watt by the Steelers. #NFLDraft

857799424579424260 2017-04-27 03:31:34 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Browns take the third TE of the first round. This guy is borderline freakish athlete, could be a great pick. #NFLDraft
857798052530323456 2017-04-27 03:26:07 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> So Forest Lamp went with a lamp endorsement, what is this Taco Charlton guy gonna come up with? #NFLDraft
857797339834179590 2017-04-27 03:23:17 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Some impressive clips of his play, I like reliable guys more than flashy guys.
857796376889090048 2017-04-27 03:19:27 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> The Browns sneak back into the 1st round for a 3rd pick! after a trade with the Packers. #NFLDraft
857795517664907269 2017-04-27 03:16:03 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Some raw emotion on display. Deion handled it well. #NFLDraft
857793970038034433 2017-04-27 03:09:54 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> This is a genuine steal. #NFLDrafthttps://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/857793747714691072
857793695873212417 2017-04-27 03:08:48 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Atlanta gets the trade they wanted. Will anyone else try to move up? #NFLDraft
857791676533936130 2017-04-27 03:00:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> The Browns also add Peppers to their defense, I feel like this guy has a high ceiling. #NFLDraft
857790838319001600 2017-04-27 02:57:27 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Raiders get a guy who may actually be a Raper. Not sure I like this. #NFLDraft
857789868621148161 2017-04-27 02:53:36 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Another TE off the board, should be a big advantage for the Giants. #NFLDraft
857787957012553728 2017-04-27 02:46:00 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @J_Davis_40 @Lions @PFF Building a team to beat the Packers passing attack is a solid NFC north strategy.

857784582795653126 2017-04-27 02:32:36 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> And how do you get your top choice in the whole draft at number 20? #NFLDrafthttps://twitter.com/NFL/status/857784255249776641
857784183011278848 2017-04-27 02:31:00 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Nice weapon for Tampa, Howard will be dangerous with Evans drawing so much attention. #NFLDraft
857782815722790912 2017-04-27 02:25:34 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SeviriaCosplay Rias is perfect for you.
857782467037728768 2017-04-27 02:24:11 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Haha, you better really believe in his potential to develop on D if you do.
857782098953940995 2017-04-27 02:22:43 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> They'll need to use him as a returner and work on his dB skills for a year or two.
857781798335639552 2017-04-27 02:21:32 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Crazy, pick 18 is up now, still none off the board!https://twitter.com/EricNeedsaBeer/status/857763621035806720

857778903481556993 2017-04-27 02:10:02 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Can never have enough help in the defensive backfield.
857778383874383872 2017-04-27 02:07:58 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DawnAtFOX9 I'm scratching my head right now, that seems like a serious concern unless you only need 2 seasons out of a guy.
857775994488442881 2017-04-27 01:58:28 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Hard to explain the guys who are still on the board, only one straight up silly move so far though.
857775627868438528 2017-04-27 01:57:01 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DailyNorseman Right, no way we could've had as good a season without Bradford. Might have seen a top 5 pick without him.
857775311810953216 2017-04-27 01:55:45 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Haha, but he'll be a good player.
857773884308938752 2017-04-27 01:50:05 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> I like Reddick to AZ, he moves all over the field. Not a steal but solid value. #NFLDraft
857771877674209280 2017-04-27 01:42:06 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DawnAtFOX9 They probably shouldn't have been. Some damn good defensive players on the slide, wish we had a pick tonight...
857771364874420224 2017-04-27 01:40:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> All those picks, but can the Browns figure out what to do with them? #NFLDrafthttps://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/857770611870801920
857770864930115584 2017-04-27 01:38:05 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> I love trades, this year doesn't disapoint. Watson to Houston, I think the fans will be happy with the pick for now anyway. #NFLDraft
857769452162740224 2017-04-27 01:32:28 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Lattimore might be a great pick, not sure it fixes their D the way a better passrush would. #NFLDraft
857767536619921408 2017-04-27 01:24:51 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Saints better pick a guy who can block. #NFLDraft
857765774202744832 2017-04-27 01:17:51 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DailyNorseman Probably not though.
857765334891233280 2017-04-27 01:16:07 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing Well I can't fault him for being a normal, hetero, teen boy.
857764895466692608 2017-04-27 01:14:22 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Bengals decided to go with crazy speed, interesting move. #NFLDraft
857763621035806720 2017-04-27 01:09:18 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Will we see O-line anytime soon? #NFLDraft
857763140615929856 2017-04-27 01:07:23 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> I really like McCaffrey #KeepPounding this was the guy they wanted, too. #NFLDraft
857760015616286720 2017-04-27 00:54:58 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> With Adams off the board there aren't that many "sure things" left. #NFLDraft
857757973883609088 2017-04-27 00:46:52 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Davis should be the playmaker Tennessee needs, longterm fix for that offense.  #NFLDraft
857756938892976129 2017-04-27 00:42:45 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> That took a long time, yikes!
857756507689148416 2017-04-27 00:41:02 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> I'd trade out of 5th spot, someone wants it. #NFLDraft
857755616995094528 2017-04-27 00:37:30 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Not my top rb, but he'll be very good. #NFLDraft
857754533258244096 2017-04-27 00:33:11 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Solid pick for the 9ers, they made out like bandits considering they still got their guy plus the picks from CHI. #NFLDraft
857752873072984065 2017-04-27 00:26:35 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DailyNorseman I figured Cleveland would take him at 12, good thing the bears moved up. #NFLDraft
857752526908739585 2017-04-27 00:25:13 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DawnAtFOX9 This move will be one we can laugh about for many, many years. #NFLDraft
857752264919875585 2017-04-27 00:24:10 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Oh God that GM doesn't know what he's doing. Maybe trade down 10 spots for Trubisky... #NFLDraft
857751846781423616 2017-04-27 00:22:31 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Wtf Chicago want that bad to move up one spot? #NFLDraft

857737575896952835 2017-04-27 23:25:48 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikings We had a bunch of picks that didn't translate to any players last year, too. Hope at least 2 of these are dealt away to trade up.
857388673364623360 2017-04-26 00:19:23 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @MoveTheSticks @NFL When you can't get a starting lineman later, you prob shouldn't grab a rb. This mock stuff is junk.

856229172376731648 2017-04-23 19:31:57 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @GeeksOfColor It should be an epic story, so you're right that they need the right people to get it done the way it deserves to be told.

849251117888393216 2017-04-04 13:23:39 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @amyheartsbatman So people shouldn't point out when something is wrong? What if it was a joke about lazy blacks, just chill? @TheEllenShow should apologize.
849058278789308416 2017-04-03 00:37:23 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @abouthalfthree @the_author_ Even 12 year old boys are capable of being in full peacock mode though, they're already acting aggressively and it could trigger worse.
849022932185755653 2017-04-03 22:16:55 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TheEllenShow @amyheartsbatman It's sexist and insulting, someone like Ellen that is fighting for equality should know that it isn't funny.
849015320601927680 2017-04-03 21:46:41 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TheEllenShow Why do you say that, are men just bad parents or something?

848325463604948992 2017-04-01 00:05:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @GeeksOfColor @bygoditswilber @CubaBaddingJr Sad truth of it. They'll try to succeed by appropriating the story, figuring the Anime crowd is too small to worry about anyway.
848323697048006656 2017-04-01 23:58:25 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @GeeksOfColor @bygoditswilber @CubaBaddingJr More likely they'll think it wasn't whitewashed enough, still too Oriental. Next one: no Japan,  one token black, male lead.

847117773658558464 2017-03-29 16:06:30 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikeologist should have it be from one central location on video review, not up to individual refs at games.

843241693973495808 2017-03-18 23:24:21 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @netflix @biomass48 @MisterJ831 @Joshinyobagels you're completely missing the point, they do because it was wrong in the first place.

843191383339024384 2017-03-18 20:04:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @netflix @biomass48 @MisterJ831 it is, that's why there is so much backlash. The world isn't white, other people deserve representation.

842719846370594817 2017-03-17 12:50:43 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DanielleCosplay I bet you'll sell lots of prints.
842564256553992195 2017-03-16 02:32:27 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> lots of nice guys out there, show their true colors when they can hide behind the keys.
842489213228650499 2017-03-16 21:34:15 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @kittenWar that always makes me feel better.
842388885518856192 2017-03-16 14:55:35 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AniMiaOfficial I was worried you wore that sweater out in public and were causing crashes, glad it's just road rage!
842202512107163648 2017-03-15 02:35:00 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> might be the demographic, came out like 10 years ago so maybe people about 10 yrs older or more are the ones into it.
842196805639114752 2017-03-15 02:12:20 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> I think SOA was pretty popular most of its run, lots of coworkers would talk about it, pretty high ratings for cable.
842143511784873986 2017-03-15 22:40:34 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Amouranth set him up, tell him to come meet you and have some "friends" meet him instead.
842111597426401281 2017-03-15 20:33:45 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @amethyst_leon and the approach we take with our activism is important, because we can look back and see where it has been ineffective.
842111251861929984 2017-03-15 20:32:22 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @amethyst_leon education, changing the way we raise our sons will be the way to bring vast cultural changes regarding feminism.
842110951868506112 2017-03-15 20:31:11 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @amethyst_leon using guilt by calling out all the other men won't work to change things. If it did, we wouldn't have a problem anymore.
842110508098584576 2017-03-15 20:29:25 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @amethyst_leon most men that are predators aren't going to be pressured into changing their behavior or attitude,
842077019764600833 2017-03-15 18:16:21 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Ridd1e @JCJakobsen I'm an old man, had to Google it. Wasn't disappointed 
842073417583063040 2017-03-15 18:02:02 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing a key reason why there has always beenso much effort to dehumanize people of color.
842054531802402816 2017-03-15 16:46:59 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Kmsp @myfox9 the cop that played judge, jury and executioner is saying this? #PhilandoCastile
842047048488751104 2017-03-15 16:17:15 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @terencenewman @Vikings @ZH2812 he was a free agent, now he is a Viking again, seems simple.

839934338368225280 2017-03-09 20:22:06 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @VikesVsHaters sandbag would trip a few guys up at least, never called for false start or holding.
839929179235827712 2017-03-09 20:01:36 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @PokemonGoApp hold on, I need to translate this from Czech.
839606629314269184 2017-03-08 22:39:54 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @tsunderica welcome home.
839577748440027137 2017-03-08 20:45:08 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DailyNorseman left tackle will be a huge problem again, we'll pay for it when Bradford gets hurt and lost for the season.
839482303135027200 2017-03-08 14:25:52 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @vikingterritory @PFF_Sam really makes it hurt when you look at how little they've invested via draft, doomed for years.
839325127527567361 2017-03-07 04:01:18 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Finally, I'm at Marcus Cinema to watch #Logan on the Ultra Screen!

838105320446705664 2017-03-04 19:14:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ru_thompson the sound of stomping 3 year old at 6:45 am is pretty cool, too... 
838027979468996608 2017-03-04 14:06:54 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @tarastrong same blind faith that doomed the Hillbots. Our society lacks critical thinking skills, lacks common sense, lacks a conscience.
837915725268418560 2017-03-03 06:40:51 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @IcebergLuffy with enough power, you can write the history books, silence your detractors, create your own truth.

837709099072618497 2017-03-03 16:59:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @gates_mcfadden we could cut def budget in half instead of adding 54B and still spend more than anyone.

836705597181542400 2017-02-28 22:32:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @MarthaYoung maybe "love you long time" to be a little more formal.
836703900602363905 2017-02-28 22:25:29 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DailyNorseman I think Bill Polian should be in a memory care unit.

824149875961036800 2017-01-24 07:00:17 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Zerggiee money makes them blind. Looks good on paper, but they've never had to do your job to see your reality.
824148562992885760 2017-01-24 06:55:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Zerggiee why would they share profits with employees? Payroll is controllable, adds to the bottom line, buys execs yachts and jets.

822906747744636928 2017-01-21 20:40:32 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SarahKSilverman @Michilin so you don't vote for your leadership, and you are worried about ours. Got it.
822829120170131456 2017-01-21 15:32:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SarahKSilverman @Michilin so do you vote? Are you a citizen? Trying to overcome that concept?

815633299381121024 2017-01-01 18:58:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DailyNorseman must have had help to get all the gear in and gain access.

814490993902911488 2016-12-29 15:19:20 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @1500ESPN better question: how many games would they have won had they drafted O-line instead of Treadwell.
814490506642288640 2016-12-29 15:17:23 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ComicBookNOW I love SOA but no way would I want Sutter to touch Punisher. It wouldn't make it through a first season.

812816498599358464 2016-12-24 00:25:29 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> had they drafted a lineman we might not be talking about missing the playoffs.
812815823572242432 2016-12-24 00:22:48 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @JonValencia_WiB 1st round pick Laquon Treadwell healthy all season, 1 catch for 15 yards, that was the real wasted 1st Rd pick.

812517310124720128 2016-12-23 04:36:37 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @IcebergLuffy they need to be watched legally so they get the credit, so they can keep making more including good VO for dubs.

810913112022990848 2016-12-19 18:22:06 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AnneWheaton that was the Russians, or something.

809116909002256384 2016-12-14 19:24:38 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @NFL @GregJennings probably the Cowboys. When I first got into football in jr. high about 1990, loved Emmitt, even wore 22 in high school.

808820431897718784 2016-12-13 23:46:32 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CassandraRules earliest birth was just 21 weeks, and that was nearly 30 years ago, science/medicine will keep advancing.
808818266537922560 2016-12-13 23:37:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Blue42Dolfan maybe he can be rookie coach of the year. I get the poit, just don't see the level of success to justify the award.
808812346781143041 2016-12-13 23:14:25 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BuckyBrooks @dallascowboys @Chiefs @NFL @gpromiami14 are the winning/tied for division lead like the others? Nope, 3 games behind Pats
808810162593079296 2016-12-13 23:05:44 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BuckyBrooks @dallascowboys @Chiefs @NFL lions and raiders have been so bad for so long, those guys deserve the accolades.

808366262762041345 2016-12-12 17:41:50 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikings @EmperorBlazo exactly. Can't blame him, he pounds away every game. They can't get that one yard for other reasons.
808352489892442116 2016-12-12 16:47:06 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikings need to work on those goal line plays, we can see how hard Asiata trys, but there's nothing there.

808027688195735552 2016-12-11 19:16:27 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikeologist run jet up the middle, asiata to the outside, it's like they're calling plays while blindfolded.
808026054489243653 2016-12-11 19:09:58 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Fucking ridiculous #Vikings fail again at the goal line.

803470115178246144 2016-11-28 05:26:17 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @GeorgeTakei @jeffdomingues @StopMeltdown so in a place like NYC w/9M pop, how many acres does it take, and are they available in the city?
803468067086942208 2016-11-28 05:18:09 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @GeorgeTakei @jeffdomingues @StopMeltdown I guess you have no idea how much land would be needed to do so, even for vegan diets.

795337616396873728 2016-11-06 18:50:39 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Now 4 plays in a row the offensive line has moved us backwards... #Vikings

795327400733274113 2016-11-06 18:10:03 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> I love that Flash was right there as the PR caught it, shining on special teams. #Vikings
795326515047256066 2016-11-06 18:06:32 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> The play calling already seems better. #Vikings
795325526680420352 2016-11-06 18:02:36 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AnneWheaton smart to get it done before all the ice and snow. Oh wait, you don't live here...

793837925326651392 2016-11-02 15:31:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikings @AmyHockert it certainly wasn't working out under this year's circumstances, we should see immediate improvements.
793829548529815552 2016-11-02 14:58:07 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ESPNNFL but Norv is a mastermind! It was so unpredictable when they added 2 wildcat plays per game this season.

790241977581375490 2016-10-23 17:22:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DailyNorseman ball at the 1 and we blow it, not good, defense handed us a score and squandered it.

787020771327639553 2016-10-14 20:02:28 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SenSanders but the candidate you endorsed is in favor of it?
786789963941617666 2016-10-13 04:45:19 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @FastPokeMapCom top hotspot in my community had the same thing happen. Now only nest hunting occurs, killed the social aspect, what a shame.
786427096897773568 2016-10-12 04:43:25 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CassandraRules actually almost all of my favorite celebrities do, I've had to unfollow a few, got blocked by some, too

786252954886086657 2016-10-12 17:11:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SarahKSilverman @dansterl too bad his wife can never be president.
786217478275817472 2016-10-12 14:50:28 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @MarkRuffalo @KatrinaNation @thenation I would vote for her, for those issues, but I don't think they're her real agenda, just pandering.
786041124737560579 2016-10-11 03:09:42 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @MoTancharoen so awesome,  just keeps getting better! #AgentsofSHIELD

786032403345084416 2016-10-11 02:35:03 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @mollysearcy that was super nice. And thank you, too!
785852671152488449 2016-10-11 14:40:51 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @athielen19 @MRS_T_19 Congratulations you two! Very happy for you guys!
785515924329795585 2016-10-10 16:22:45 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @YourAnonNews nope, need that money for campaign funds.
785478015924903937 2016-10-10 13:52:07 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @GeorgeTakei if he claims she lacks physical stamina yet still never quits references her spirit. Just salty he gave an actual compliment.
785324162239782913 2016-10-09 03:40:45 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @votegriffin @MinnPost someone might not get a new jet or yacht if they have to share profits with workers, though.
785308276657270784 2016-10-09 02:37:38 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @GeeksOfColor meanwhile he gave her a very nice, honest compliment.
785306117861629952 2016-10-09 02:29:03 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @YourAnonNews can both of them be arrested right after the #debate? #HillaryforPrison #TrumpforPrison

785305197153177601 2016-10-09 02:25:23 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SarahKSilverman he acts like a bratty child, no #debate skills.
785304758626070530 2016-10-09 02:23:39 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Does Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?  Hillary (and every other sane person): No.
785303481787650049 2016-10-09 02:18:34 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @emrata must be a nervous tic kinda thing, maybe seasonal allergies. Can't believe his team didn't address it (or they tried...)
785303043185094656 2016-10-09 02:16:50 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @elizabethforma @MarkRuffalo @realDonaldTrump doesn't everyone take all the deductions they can? Like when we use TurboTax or whatever?
785301784440942592 2016-10-09 02:11:50 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TheDemocrats @lotteverbeek1 wait, no. She got the rapist of a 12 year old off when she was a lawyer, that was during her life.
785301213784842240 2016-10-09 02:09:34 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @lorrainecink that should be standard operating procedure, can't believe it.
785300681351499776 2016-10-09 02:07:27 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> No. Don't want someone who lost $6B as Secretary of State either.https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/785297698408787968
785300169034129408 2016-10-09 02:05:25 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @amyklobuchar I'll have to agree with @BernieSanders on this one.

785120894398173184 2016-10-09 14:13:02 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AnneWheaton his point is that Hillary defended & supported him, attacked and bullied his accusers, and it isn't a short list of women.

784463379167449089 2016-10-07 18:40:18 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SarahKSilverman Hillary should have her people make Trump voters use provisional ballots then leave them in boxes until after the election.

783300650549579776 2016-10-04 13:40:02 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @truthorange maybe because smokers are always taking extra smoke breaks instead of working, earning raises and promotions.

780625441493102592 2016-09-26 04:29:43 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Roxanne_Mckee @alrightlandlord this election is bringing out nothing but fear and hate. I miss Bernie so much.
780623420161613824 2016-09-26 04:21:41 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @alrightlandlord @Roxanne_Mckee well he deleted his delightful tweet; let's not forget.pic.twitter.com/eMx6omG8bl
780622869935955968 2016-09-26 04:19:30 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Roxanne_Mckee @alrightlandlord also depends on when she tested, she's in mid 30s? IQ changes, but a childhood or college score is valid imo
780622461498822656 2016-09-26 04:17:52 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Roxanne_Mckee @alrightlandlord she could've scored a 147, there are several reliable IQ assessments, not just the Wechsler.
780621188452061184 2016-09-26 04:12:49 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @alrightlandlord @Roxanne_Mckee To laymen a highly or profoundly gifted individual would qualify as genius, 147 is still top 1%
780616076082020352 2016-09-26 03:52:30 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @YOSOYCORDOVA well I may still change my mind, might take a while longer but I do listen to reason. Hope they discuss the pipeline next time
780614697036845056 2016-09-26 03:47:01 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @YOSOYCORDOVA so you're telling me that picture of him with a taco bowl didn't win you back? 
780612800141938688 2016-09-26 03:39:29 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders @YOSOYCORDOVA I love the things Hillary says now, just that she never acted that way in the past. Feels like pandering.
780612411145396224 2016-09-26 03:37:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders @YOSOYCORDOVA Trump's trickle-down economics will make the rich richer, lost me with that, even though I like the trade plan.
780611387923968002 2016-09-26 03:33:52 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders @YOSOYCORDOVA I'll probably still write in Sanders. I won't vote out of fear.
780610429286436864 2016-09-26 03:30:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Marina_Sirtis @TommyZ34 we call that cherry-picked data, not good for actual statistical analysis. Nice colorful graph though.
780609712312025088 2016-09-26 03:27:13 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Marina_Sirtis @Jenniesapetal @bergopolis Trump was ranting, not answering. Hillary was cool, very rehearsed. One's a lawyer & politician.
780608000989900800 2016-09-26 03:20:25 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders @YOSOYCORDOVA well I'm sure they rigged the nomination process and cheated Bernie. Even if Trump is a monster #NeverHillary
780605708517593090 2016-09-26 03:11:18 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders @YOSOYCORDOVA I'm pretty sure she paid him a lot for the support, maybe threats, maybe promises. Certainly didn't earn it.
780603152789712896 2016-09-26 03:01:09 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CassandraRules being a lawyer, having decades of experience as a politician, and many more debates served her well.
780602000266321920 2016-09-26 02:56:34 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CassandraRules Trump was too argumentative, he also bragged too much, and dodged too many questions.
780601309909037056 2016-09-26 02:53:49 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TorreySmithWR too bad so many of them were energized to vote, then got screwed by Hillary and the DNC.
780493673557393408 2016-09-26 19:46:07 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SarahKSilverman best political strategy is dehumanization. Trump must become an even scarier monster than Hillary to win.
780262080179941376 2016-09-25 04:25:51 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @nflnetwork You guys are like weather forecasters.pic.twitter.com/YQ7Ev8cnFT

780109492239368192 2016-09-25 18:19:31 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DawnAtFOX9 I wish it was a joke.
780109302904266752 2016-09-25 18:18:46 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Great punt return for a td, followed by Walsh... just start going for 2. #Vikings
780103228188942336 2016-09-25 17:54:37 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> #Vikings best defense is Carolina penalties.
780082833209626624 2016-09-25 16:33:35 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @RapSheet @NFL seems fishy, maybe if he is fin or pass protection.
780081990037102597 2016-09-25 16:30:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders I'm not protesting, I'm voting against corruption.  #NeverHillary
780079440214814720 2016-09-25 16:20:06 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CassandraRules everyone needs to give him a break, Obama sat him down and told him how things work, and he needs to abide or else.
780078463126568960 2016-09-25 16:16:13 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @GeorgeTakei how high is your horse? Hope you don't fall.
780030318526930944 2016-09-25 13:04:54 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Lyz_B but that means they're working, pulled all that dog treat mojo out through your feet. You'll thank them later.
779121232256045056 2016-09-22 00:52:31 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HalleyBorderCol the best part is when she was on the board at Walmart, crushing workers' attempts to organize & closing small businesses.
779079722336681984 2016-09-22 22:07:35 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CassandraRules didn't even call your local shopping buddy, Eric, cmon man.
778973566494576640 2016-09-22 15:05:45 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ESPNNFL Move it to @usbankstadium We'll have no problem finding 66,000 fans to load the place up and cheer for both teams!

778686942779088896 2016-09-21 20:06:49 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikings @NFL should've added an offensive lineman, promote @cjham28 to the active roster instead.

777675510021296128 2016-09-18 01:07:44 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Can't have Peterson keep stopping, looking around like that, might not even match the 31 yards he got last week.

758388853027766272 2016-07-27 19:49:27 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @realDonaldTrump @YourAnonNews @OGDuckWhisperer silly to think there were ever any transcripts, the money was exchanged, not for a speech.
758387728925032449 2016-07-27 19:44:59 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @RobertPicardo @BBCNews there is nothing to worry about, they are personal emails with no security threats, not top secret or classified.

758349983091417088 2016-07-27 17:15:00 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ThisWeekABC @ShaunKing but when Hillary was using unsecured servers and multiple mobile devices for classified/top secret info that was ok.

758001925694615552 2016-07-26 18:11:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Str8_Cash_Homey @vikingterritory problem is he might be 8th in line, but how does he compare to the 6th guy? I'll take him over utility.

757927466107301888 2016-07-26 13:16:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton it is ridiculous that with 157 million women in America that we somehow wound up with this one as our choice.
757926226883448832 2016-07-26 13:11:08 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @thauserkstp @KSTP and they're all wondering how that kind of corruption is acceptable to the American people.

757694127580540928 2016-07-25 21:48:51 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders @mork1215 I didn't ask you that, I asked if any of the Clinton scandals pissed you off, and then you went on a Trump rant.
757685938608824322 2016-07-25 21:16:19 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders @mork1215 but again, I'm a Bernie supporter, why are you trying to tell me about Trump?
757685627836137472 2016-07-25 21:15:05 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders @mork1215 didn't Hillary talk about black people being superpredators? I haven't heard Trump say anything like that.
757684689339572224 2016-07-25 21:11:21 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders @mork1215 and why are you talking to me about Trump? I support Bernie, try to stay on topic.
757684455544918016 2016-07-25 21:10:25 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders @mork1215 supporters aren't the same as a person's actual actions. But we can talk about Clinton Foundation donors.

757605359683076097 2016-07-25 15:56:08 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @amyklobuchar you should stand up there and denounce the DNC and Hillary for trivializing the democratic process.
757600390808559619 2016-07-25 15:36:23 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SwiftOnSecurity @ChrisWarcraft I don't understand, did Russia compose and send those emails? Who cares about hax, we care about democracy.

757340079354511360 2016-07-24 22:22:00 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @realDonaldTrump already 40% of us will not vote for her, that should hand the election to Trump.

755774232198582272 2016-07-20 14:39:53 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton who is "us"? If you mean Americans, neither of you represent us. Ultra rich & above the law doesn't sound like any of "US".

755412143651057664 2016-07-19 14:41:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> A popular bragging point among Republicans is that #MelaniaTrump can plagiarize in five different languages.
755409672480362497 2016-07-19 14:31:15 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @RapSheet @nyjets @NFL he should take what they are offering, I'm sure it's more than anyone else would.

753636651000356865 2016-07-14 17:05:54 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton so all of Bernie's ideas are fair game now? PANDERING won't get you his voters, you fixed the election and we won't forget!

753591494800531456 2016-07-14 14:06:28 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ChloeAHenderson it seems to be tied to phone use, higher population area should be loaded.
753590951327784960 2016-07-14 14:04:18 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ChloeAHenderson I'm in the suburbs, there are farms in walking distance, but luckily a couple parks I can drive to quick w/ a couple stops.

752335988039430148 2016-07-10 02:57:31 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ChiefElk so you feel the profession leads to DV as opposed to attracting abusive men? Interesting.

752188307891630080 2016-07-10 17:10:42 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing color didn't matter, only if they were LEO? Compare to any other professions? It isn't police vs. POC, it is about good & evil.
752179303027052544 2016-07-10 16:34:55 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton why are you talking about morals? A concept completely foreign to you.

751403196749275136 2016-07-08 13:10:57 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @RachelChazin I wonder how many people were carrying in Dallas? Sure didn't prevent another mass shooting.

750698939863695360 2016-07-06 14:32:29 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton It would be nice if you could delete the student debt like you did the emails.
750688631149432832 2016-07-06 13:51:31 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @MSFA_NewStadium @Vikeologist yeah no shit. Doesn't seem like it should be able to just fall off, you'd think it must be broken in some way.
750687916859518976 2016-07-06 13:48:41 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @MSFA_NewStadium @Vikeologist so is it a design flaw or something wrong with the installation?
750500851299549184 2016-07-05 01:25:21 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CassandraRules @macsnapon yeah they've done a great job of both...

749238393188614144 2016-07-02 13:48:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @RobertPicardo sadly, the same technique used by Hillary. What a letdown to have such a right leaning Democrat, even platform has shifted.

749041621681963008 2016-07-01 00:46:53 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BernieSanders but shouldn't we be fracking and bombing everything and leave the mess for someone else? #NeverHillary

746793306487676928 2016-06-25 19:52:53 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @wear4u so condemning an entire religion is an acceptable behavior? No part of you statement is helping anything or anyone.

746718229993787392 2016-06-25 14:54:34 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton @TwinCitiesPride @ALMPLS or it could be pandering. Too bad we're not celebrating someone who supported for decades.

746139627019505665 2016-06-23 00:35:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton how about we talk about bankruptcy and morals, Hillary.
746134096133394432 2016-06-23 00:13:25 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @LindsLaBelle loved the big tears all the way down his cheeks.
746131752704446464 2016-06-23 00:04:06 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @LindsLaBelle might consider trades too, I'm sure they're busy right now.
746131358951563267 2016-06-23 00:02:33 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @LindsLaBelle or Heild? This is tough...

746097007660523524 2016-06-23 21:46:03 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @gglindsayelyse beer is just water and a couple plants, sounds like a salad to me.
746095894412562433 2016-06-23 21:41:37 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews the world is full of mothers who've lost sons to Clinton policies.
746095139723022336 2016-06-23 21:38:37 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ChristinaMarieK already on it.
746012275081875456 2016-06-23 16:09:21 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> We should put one of these pipelines through a national park, what could go wrong?https://twitter.com/AP/status/746000998901092353
746009342936293377 2016-06-23 15:57:42 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @RobertPicardo I'll have to buy some to use & some to save.
745977050603917313 2016-06-23 13:49:23 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @drewbrees do you need to already be freaky fast, or is that part of the training?
745791290944663553 2016-06-22 01:31:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @wilw you don't follow @elmo ?
745787518679920640 2016-06-22 01:16:15 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ChristinaMarieK 
745695798873165824 2016-06-22 19:11:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton your record says otherwise. Were in favor of a wall far before Trump, even voted for it https://youtu.be/AlFi0QUboxs
745693631084892160 2016-06-22 19:03:10 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton but what about black children and the pipeline to prison? Did you change your stance on Super-predators? Didn't think so.
745692917277286401 2016-06-22 19:00:20 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton what about raising the minimum wage to a living wage? #FightFor15
745667733308719105 2016-06-22 17:20:16 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> oh no, not the Vikings training camp jersey!
745663950809862144 2016-06-22 17:05:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ESPNNFL so basically lack of work ethic? Come on, be a leader @AdrianPeterson set an example.
745659166786727936 2016-06-22 16:46:13 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @KSTP let me guess, a pit bull?
745654737870139392 2016-06-22 16:28:37 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton @igorvolsky @repjohnlewis what if they did a sit-in protesting voter suppression and rigged elections?
745651265867218945 2016-06-22 16:14:49 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @INCH @GOHUSKIESWOOOOO @HodgeUMah this one seems legit.
745649972377436161 2016-06-22 16:09:41 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DrJillStein that is very misleading, good way to lose the 5% that you have.

745387801236013056 2016-06-21 22:47:55 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Diablo twisters still need a bigger nerf hammer? Monk and Barb still need bigger buffs? Thought so...
745386799279669249 2016-06-21 22:43:56 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @AlterNet he's a regular Bill Clinton! No wonder they are all such good friends.

745250728147574784 2016-06-21 13:43:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton a woman who sat on the board of Walmart, crushing union attempts and forcing minimum wage, part time no benefits & poverty.
745249469000724480 2016-06-21 13:38:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton and this coming from someone who takes her orders from the billionaire class & paid off by Goldman Sachs.
745103352946528256 2016-06-20 03:57:37 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @JoeBiden @HillaryClinton @VPLive @VP why is he calling it a democracy? If it was, wouldn't our votes actually count?

745006942305796096 2016-06-20 21:34:31 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton how about drone violence, who could we ask to end that? Should we send it via anonymous fax or unsecured email?

744952769723916290 2016-06-20 17:59:15 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @eileendefreest @AckerleyJames the only people who should have guns are the ones who made huge contributions to the Clinton Foundation.
744938239107162112 2016-06-20 17:01:31 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AniMiaOfficial @Famardy nice job, looks like you had fun!
744911319397240832 2016-06-20 15:14:32 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton she's on the phone asking why nobody is at her rally, and wondering why they didn't even put up a stage this time.

743632821336539137 2016-06-16 02:34:15 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton @JordanChariton they aren't hiding it at all, she's been saying it's her turn all along. They decided for us.
743632032874496000 2016-06-16 02:31:07 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HillaryClinton @Phil_Mattingly sure good for women, as long as they are rich, white, American women.

743444717233410049 2016-06-16 14:06:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShivaniGhai @ABC if we as a nation are going to have a conversation about these guns, we should understand the differences.
743444434323406849 2016-06-16 14:05:40 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShivaniGhai @ABC but those are just civilian copies of military weapons, they aren't automatic.
743439903820754944 2016-06-16 13:47:40 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShivaniGhai automatic weapons have been illegal since 1934, not sure when the cheese laws went into effect.

743197271957868545 2016-06-15 21:43:32 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @amyklobuchar How about no more handguns, no semi-auto rifles, no removable magazines. Limit to pump/bolt long guns for hunt/target/def.

742027459365720064 2016-06-12 16:15:07 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CassandraRules @ladyrelaynie looks like a hoax in the early reports. Most importantly the truth is out now.
742020728564785153 2016-06-12 15:48:22 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CassandraRules guns are the easy answer, in places where guns aren't as accessible a bomb does the same.

730019129395060737 2016-05-10 12:58:18 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TomButlerFOX9 @surlybrewing @MAFox9 oh yes, that is certainly a go-to for me.
730016040365608960 2016-05-10 12:46:01 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @TomButlerFOX9 @MAFox9 Abrasive by @surlybrewing but like MA I have an extensive list.
729801463686275072 2016-05-09 22:33:22 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikeologist @Jacob_Frey @CityMinneapolis why build a stadium and then try to ruin the atmosphere, tradition & fan experience?

726848860828520449 2016-05-01 19:00:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BooooooYahhh @conraesing @BernieSanders didn't something like 170 published economists review the plan and concluded it would indeed work?
726637397451137024 2016-04-30 05:00:30 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @tsunderica for me it's less confusing than Bleach at least, I never knew wtf was going on. #dimensionw
726626968192581632 2016-04-30 04:19:03 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BooooooYahhh @conraesing @BernieSanders I see you aren't familiar with the plan, may as well talk about it as if you are well versed.
726565588500398081 2016-04-30 00:15:09 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @BooooooYahhh @conraesing @BernieSanders looks too hard, better not try. Good plan, don't expect anyone to have a better life.
726135517679476736 2016-04-29 19:46:13 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ESPNNFL good thing he didn't wreck it showing off.
726120474669797376 2016-04-29 18:46:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @craftsman Probably a huge mess. But I'll clean it up with my Craftsman wet/dry vac!
726070093096996867 2016-04-29 15:26:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikeologist @JoeBanner13 they dominate at ruining the careers of qbs, and perhaps at signing drug addicts.
726069497694572545 2016-04-29 15:23:52 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @JoeBanner13 too bad the Browns will never find a guy to throw to him, not that he knows how to run a route, anyway.

725882745885323265 2016-04-28 03:01:47 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @PFF so many warning signs, not thrilled at all.

725877874729734144 2016-04-28 02:42:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @joelklatt @DailyNorseman trade it away, no must have at 23, same value at 31.
725876295016407040 2016-04-28 02:36:09 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Vikeologist I can see it, I'd like Shep.

725869196865728513 2016-04-28 02:07:57 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing his drop to 13 cost him $8m

725864538411659264 2016-04-28 01:49:26 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @JonValencia_WiB I was just looking up draft trade values to see what it would take to trade up for him, what a steal.
725864198308143105 2016-04-28 01:48:05 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @AGirl4Bernie I'm not going to answer this. 
725863399498780672 2016-04-28 01:44:54 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @DawnAtFOX9 the Dolphins just got a huge steal, unless there were more character questions from interviews we're unaware of.
725860196342337537 2016-04-28 01:32:11 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Ok, I had Hargreaves going to TB 2 spots earlier, so at least I have that going for me... #NFLDraft2016

725843026837393413 2016-04-28 00:23:57 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> Wentz at no. 2 to Philly, with these out of the way we can start looking for some excitement!  #NFLDraft2016

725837352724209665 2016-04-28 00:01:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShayneWellsMSP what do you think, I'm guessing they take a big defensive lineman to replace bj?
725833510053896192 2016-04-28 23:46:08 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @PFF @PFF_Sam regardless of comparisons, he should be drafted much earlier than most mocks, if not Dallas maybe someone trades up.

725747799816466432 2016-04-28 18:05:33 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @JonValencia_WiB @CTOconsultant @PFF I might be way off, but I did a mock yesterday and had them taking Bosa following the BPA strategy.
725744049601306624 2016-04-28 17:50:39 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @JonValencia_WiB @CTOconsultant @PFF unless he is already gone. But trading down makes sense unless they take a tackle.
725684058231971840 2016-04-28 13:52:16 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @newrepublic @Shaneoo88 @CassandraRules @NewRepublic kids love Deadpool, perfect for them.
725503183754129408 2016-04-27 01:53:32 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @prema46 @ShaunKing was it Trump who was talking about Super Predators? Maybe private prisons donating to his campaign?
725431844938739712 2016-04-27 21:10:04 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Damadar @elsaweber333 and it could end up that way again without closed primaries to protect the establishment voters the rest of the way.
725430850121175041 2016-04-27 21:06:07 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Damadar @elsaweber333 right on the pledged delegates, because like in '08 those Super Ds might start changing depending on momentum.
725348869064654848 2016-04-27 15:40:21 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Damadar @elsaweber333 and Hillary won't get what she needs, either.

705087014564048896 2016-03-02 17:46:58 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @CassandraRules @Salon again, showing us what a leader she is. Throwing it in a girls face and being dismissive, putting her in her place.

704692983682039808 2016-03-01 15:41:14 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @WarrenB401 @Dkdawgpound total "welfare" spending is around 10% of total spending, actual military spending is about 3x that.
704690697568280576 2016-03-01 15:32:09 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Dkdawgpound @WarrenB401 @TorreySmithWR over 50% of the US budget is military, only 6% education, 3% unemployment, etc.
704689576141455360 2016-03-01 15:27:42 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Dkdawgpound @WarrenB401 @TorreySmithWR wow are you wrong on those figures, this is readily available public info.

704149338549686272 2016-02-28 03:40:59 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @FusionNews they had to buy friends in college, they probably weren't happy to begin with.

703802475921469440 2016-02-27 04:42:40 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SuperheroFeed cancel both... right after season seven.

703630999784071168 2016-02-27 17:21:17 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SuperheroFeed I still don't know why all the Egyptian Gods are white.
703630354574286848 2016-02-27 17:18:44 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @12017yet yeah, equality is an old, tired argument. Glad you recognize we aren't bigots in MN, though.
703622715786145793 2016-02-27 16:48:22 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @12017yet @AGirl4Bernie why should the government force restaurants to serve colored  people is my question.
703621464570724352 2016-02-27 16:43:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SuperheroFeed I mean, tribbles are basically baby ewoks, right?

702690382623080448 2016-02-24 03:03:37 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing @YaraShahidi this was an amazing episode. They should be showing it in every classroom across America.
702540456589066240 2016-02-24 17:07:52 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Budweiser what they dont tell you is he wasn't invited, and he left in a sqad car.
702502308173606912 2016-02-24 14:36:16 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @PFF @PFF_Sam with one season left, no. He knows the system, is a leader, valuable depth.

702333150425325568 2016-02-23 03:24:06 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @MaryMorientes seems pretty focused to me. If she was a leader, she would release them, not wait for Republicans to release theirs.
702330363968815106 2016-02-23 03:13:02 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @MaryMorientes ready to release the transcripts or?

701890999274967040 2016-02-22 22:07:09 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @Budweiser so that is like a giant septic tank? It makes more sense to me now.
701868235247882241 2016-02-22 20:36:42 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @myfox9 @itzmtnxd @MyFOX9 you don't think something that offensive should make people upset? It's a state issued plate, not a bumper sticker.
701866959244165120 2016-02-22 20:31:37 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @myfox9 @itzmtnxd @MyFOX9 there are rules for plates, they slipped that one by, not a freedom of speech issue.

697428484314902529 2016-02-10 14:34:42 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @gt_carter @gdebenedetti @OwenJones84 the idea is to stop exploiting the working class.

693598320220991488 2016-01-30 00:55:00 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing I have some other words to describe him. Not sure thug fits, because I usually associate it with being tough or intimidating.
693520457446756352 2016-01-30 19:45:36 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @SentaiFilmworks @ChristinaMarieK @Sentaifilmworks Yes! #AkameGaKill

693194456648953856 2016-01-29 22:10:12 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @HEARMYLULLABY @hearmylullaby any chance you could convince a store to order it or stock ot for you?

693081250626580480 2016-01-29 14:40:21 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @myfox9 @TomButlerFOX9 @MyFOX9 I only had one decoration up on the garage this year, so it was already taken down.
692737071983648769 2016-01-28 15:52:43 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @LindsLaBelle @Kmsp I still don't understand how it got past the first person who heard or read the proposed name.
692735785724878850 2016-01-28 15:47:36 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @livmace I'm a house husband and I'm offended.

691670968666685440 2016-01-25 17:16:24 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @JesselynRadack @YourAnonNews I don't get it. The number of deaths is very low, that is a good thing, money well spent.

691441371324948481 2016-01-24 02:04:03 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> There's your #MVP Super Cam! What a performance. He is the most dominant player in the NFL this season.
691315184707592192 2016-01-24 17:42:38 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @1on1wattsisland Pats & Cards, but these are great games, yeasterday I might have said the opposite.

690677348761370624 2016-01-22 23:28:06 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @ShaunKing people obviously can relate to the things he says without shame or embarrassment, and to his fear and hate.

690226091806429184 2016-01-21 17:34:58 UTC <EricNeedsaBeer> @NFL Patriots have the advantage, more consistent in big games. Broncos are more likely to blow it and play uncharacteristically.
