965950070511341569 2018-02-20 14:03:37 UTC <michamoore> @SpotifyCares Did @Spotify change the shuffle function? I feel like it no longer works appropriately. It essentially only shuffles songs that I've listened to lately rather than shuffling *randomly* as shuffling should?

954116244604641280 2018-01-18 22:20:13 UTC <michamoore> @honeytrapology Idk because like especially the abortion stuff - its not a real thing. You would only be forced to provide an abortion when the mom is literally dying & with that youre bound to save the patient? Its like... your duty? Also its your **moral** obligation to do so..!

942765226348417024 2017-12-18 14:35:20 UTC <michamoore> The academy wonders why the general public is confused by "evidence-based," when basic access to research is paywalled.
942765224599408641 2017-12-18 14:35:19 UTC <michamoore> Paywalling academic style manuals that were produced by associations and journals is a clear paywall to the academy itself.
