And now people can bring the "trophies" from the animals they kill into the US again too!

Then when Mueller charges Trump and finds Pence guilty (of anything) Hillary would be President and Trump would go out in a straight jacket.

My husband makes a mean vegan Chile. By the way he is not 100% vegan, he travels a lot and sometimes he goes out and does eat meat. Since he cut most meat out his cholesterol is much lower.

967947731800031232 2018-02-25 02:21:37 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB I never said anything about "making" anyone change. Eventually it will happen because growing world population will make raising animals for food untenable, too resource intensive. People will, hopefully, begin to face the reality that killing and eating a sentient being is wrong
967911863941033989 2018-02-25 23:59:05 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB I do actually. I think it's the ethical choice, the sustainable choice, and the healthy choice. Do I think it is realistic anytime soon? Probably not, that doesn't mean I'll stop advocating for it.
967906203358687238 2018-02-25 23:36:36 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB That is true.
967906073805053952 2018-02-25 23:36:05 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @Coachpmot @XaverDB @injimbles See that's the thing though, there is no reason a person can not eat a vegan diet. Are the allergic veggies?  Legumes? I guess you would have to know what exactly the problem was. Were they just not eating the right foods, not getting enough protein?
967904550559584256 2018-02-25 23:30:02 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @Coachpmot @XaverDB @injimbles It has everything to do with what you said. Your friend most likely (a guess) did not understand how to eat a vegan diet, in fairness a lot of people don't do the research they need to. If eating properly you don't need any supplements or substitutes.
967902929603743745 2018-02-25 23:23:35 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @Coachpmot @XaverDB @injimbles Actually most physicians have no training in nutrition. The reason your friends Dr suggested he return to eating meat is it was all he knew.
967898500490039296 2018-02-25 23:05:59 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @Coachpmot @XaverDB @injimbles Do you know the % of people who are obese, Diabetic (adult onset), high colestoral,Gout, kidney problems...Those diseases are related to diets including meat and too much sugar.http://www.pcrm.org/health/diets/vsk/vegetarian-starter-kit-protein
967893869693231105 2018-02-25 22:47:35 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @tribelaw I love books. I love handcrafted books, hand bound. I love old hand marbled end papers, fill the space between with transformative story telling and that's heaven. I learned to handbind, gild, and marble to afford those books

967868263916101632 2018-02-25 21:05:50 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB I was affirming that insects are animals. It has nothing to do with "organs" what grade are you in? Animalia (animals)sponges, worms, insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals
967864856656392199 2018-02-25 20:52:18 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @mayank_1443 @XaverDB That's the because we've always done it that way argument. http://blog.novologic.com/2012/07/5-monkeys-because-we-have-always-done.html?m=1
967859968375390209 2018-02-25 20:32:53 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @goth_cake @XaverDB Yes, insects are a animal based protein.
967857907936178176 2018-02-25 20:24:41 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB That's the kind of statement  I would expect from someone who doesn't know what they are talking about and has no real, educated, reasoned reply.

Read, educate yourself. Meat is never a dietary requirement for humans. There is literally no one who would not benefit from a vegan diet.

967502500092932097 2018-02-24 20:52:26 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB @Coachpmot @Zillychu You have not sited credible sources, or any for that matter, nothing to discredit. Can't research what that does not exist. To the contrary I researched extensively before becoming vegan because my health was not great. Vegan four 8 years now and healthier than I have ever been.
967500648097992706 2018-02-24 20:45:04 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @Coachpmot @XaverDB @Zillychu Uh, yeah, anyone can do this. That is not a suggestion it is a fact.  Prey tell us, just what are those health conditions that would prohibit one from eating a vegan diet?

967226774198333440 2018-02-23 02:36:47 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @guskenworthy @Coachpmot @MrEE_Man I don't think that people have not heard how abhorrently animals r treated, then killed in terrifying and painful ways, I just can't fathom knowing it yet continuing.I guess maybe I would prefer to think people don't truly understand rather than believe people know and don't care
967223981353861120 2018-02-23 02:25:41 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @guskenworthy @Coachpmot @MrEE_Man That is what makes non-vegans so annoying, it's not about not eating meat, it's much more simple, it's about not making thinking breathing beings suffer and die.
967221893278392321 2018-02-23 02:17:24 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @guskenworthy @MrEE_Man @Coachpmot There is the crux. Animals don't suffer if people don't kill them,(not in the same #'s).I don't consider it a "lifestyle choice" I consider it a moral imperative, when people are being tortured & slaughtered with impunity, choosing intervention is no more a choice, e.g Syria.
967185138953179137 2018-02-23 23:51:21 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB @LetsGoWVPower @Coachpmot You do realize the difference in a metaphor and a literal statement right? There is always a variety of ways to approach any situation. Whatever works for you is the way to go. Your success depends on being able to be empathetic and honest and not get bogged down in the minutiae
967183000734715904 2018-02-23 23:42:51 UTC <DanetteWhipple> Oh, best thing I've head in days!https://twitter.com/sarahchad_/status/967088933795454976
967181705936363521 2018-02-23 23:37:42 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB @LetsGoWVPower @Coachpmot I believe it is just easier to avoid land mines. Sharing (what I have learned) is after all, purely semantics.
967180384592121856 2018-02-23 23:32:27 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @guskenworthy @MrEE_Man @Coachpmot But it is those who are quite happy consuming animal flesh and take offence to someone attempting to "Educate them", it always carries a somewhat condescending optic.
967179048114933760 2018-02-23 23:27:09 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB No subsitutes r required. I eat some meat substitutes because I grew up eating meat and there r comfort foods I crave. Some vegans will get all nuts about that, they say "you are still dreaming of eating animals!" I just ignore them. Better to not eat animals however you do it.

967174832373846016 2018-02-23 23:10:23 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @Coachpmot @XaverDB @LetsGoWVPower Actually you can get everything the human body needs from a plant based diet, of course you need to pay attention to what you are eating, but that is true if you are eating a diet that includes animal flesh.
967169888224776192 2018-02-23 22:50:45 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB So put that in your search queries.
967169417015590912 2018-02-23 22:48:52 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB Yeah, thats what I said. If you stop killing & eating the flesh from living feeling beings it will cease being usual.
967168430330843136 2018-02-23 22:44:57 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @guskenworthy @Coachpmot @MrEE_Man And I will never except that it is acceptable to torture an animal as you kill it to make it taste better! As if killing and eating a sentient being is not bad enough .
967167734093176832 2018-02-23 22:42:11 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @guskenworthy @Coachpmot @MrEE_Man I am evolving not devolving! I have chosen to STOP eating living feeling beings in favor of a healthier cruelty free existence. Sharing sounds better than educating.Most importantly, I am not a hypocrite, I do the same w/people in my country who still eat flesh of animals.

967156678985732097 2018-02-23 21:58:15 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @XaverDB The only thing that changes it from usual to unusual is if you stop eating the flesh of sentient beings.
967155902687170560 2018-02-23 21:55:10 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @guskenworthy @Coachpmot @MrEE_Man Here's my take. You are not so much educating as you are sharing your views. I don't know anyone who appreciate being talked down to. People evolve when they acquire new information & share points of view. Some people evolve more slowly, but it doesn't happen if you don't engage.
967153987802812417 2018-02-23 21:47:34 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @MabelsVoice @XaverDB See that's the problem. If you want evidence find it, Google it. Then you will have proved it to yourself.

967152677506383872 2018-02-23 21:42:21 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @Coachpmot @XaverDB Ugh, no, it is not. I have lived quiet happily as a vegan for years. The best part is I have a clear conscience.
967151897034543107 2018-02-23 21:39:15 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @guskenworthy @Coachpmot There is actually no reason you can't point out injustice wherever you are at the moment, as long as you are not ignoring that we have a lot of work to do at home.

A trained police officer stood outside the door to the Parkland Fl. school where the shooting was happening! He waited until the shooting stopped and then went in. He Choked. enough said. #BoycottNRA

And, His good guy with a gun being the solution to a bad guy with a gun was blown to hell when a trained officer stood motionless outside the door to the school in parkland Fl. until the shooting stopped. He choked.

966828366111346689 2018-02-22 00:13:39 UTC <DanetteWhipple> A deputy arrived at the school in Parkland Fl. While the shooting was in progress. He chose to wait until the shooting stopped to go in. So much for the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun being a good guy with a gun. Just blew up The NRA's best argument.
966798556853088256 2018-02-22 22:15:12 UTC <DanetteWhipple> The NRA says "they reject" raising the age  to purchase a gun.Can we just, together, say that we don't give a f**k, what they reject!

Although these were imposed after the election it was easier for Trump to simply not implement these sanctions than to roll back Magnitsky act.

I was the oldest and literally begged her to leave, she finally did but went back, left went back. Like you mentioned, she was dependant on him for everything and she was so broken she couldn't function, could not tell anyone what was happening.

960609105424584704 2018-02-05 20:20:32 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @RepAdamSchiff @SteveSams4 I know, let's see who is actually revealed as the partisan toady he is when this all washes out. It's not Schiff. My prediction is Nunes will be ousted either by his constituents or, when it really breaks loose, his peers. Incidentally, Nunes is hiding something.

They will discredit the investigation and the GOP will block any further action.

940783445567000577 2017-12-12 03:20:26 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @TeamJakeAbbey @AltYelloNatPark Just my opinion and not everyone who has gated horses is that way (most though) lol.
940782837027962882 2017-12-12 03:18:01 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @TeamJakeAbbey @AltYelloNatPark Those gates are so hard on a horse but easy on the rider, most gated horses are lame by 8 or 10, even flat footed, but it's worse if they are padded up. If you love horses you don't make them work that hard so you can sit deep in your seat and not learn to ride.
940781660156686336 2017-12-12 03:13:21 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @TeamJakeAbbey @AltYelloNatPark It seems to be his thing to ride in to vote, then gets off and tells people they need to back up because the horses are all worked up from being racked out. Most people I have know with walking horses are not real HORSE people, they just want attention, look at me, big man
940771754527674369 2017-12-12 02:33:59 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @AltYelloNatPark @TeamJakeAbbey Yes, it is his horse. the poor sole is condemned to this creep and his lack of care. It seems to be a regular Moore stunt to ride his horse in to vote. He usually rides a little Palomino.

The way he yanks with that bit! The way people treat their horses (animals in general) is a pretty good indicator of character, he obviously has none.

837238330442014720 2017-03-02 09:49:07 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @ZehrKeith @Khanoisseur It appears to me that Ryan and McConnell are not merely obstructing, conspiracy?
837236767342362624 2017-03-02 09:42:55 UTC <DanetteWhipple> @SenWarren @remittancegirl No, I believe GOP are obstructing for a reason, beyond simply wanting to advance their agenda. Conspiracy?
