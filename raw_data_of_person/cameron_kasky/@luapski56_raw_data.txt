972208332793663488 2018-03-09 20:31:43 UTC <luapski56> @AP Well now he will have to go kiss some NRA a$$ for a donation to his upcoming run for the U.S. Senate. What a weasel.
971166816864227329 2018-03-06 23:33:07 UTC <luapski56> @FBI @RepGoodlatte @FoxNews We need to keep throwing up smoke screens because Mueller is getting a little too close for comfort. We must obstruct at every opportunity to protect our nimwit President.
970496434406641665 2018-03-04 03:09:15 UTC <luapski56> @JessicaTaylor Eva Marie Saint looked good!
970140974189039616 2018-03-03 03:36:47 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews Guess they can go get a job shilling for the NRA now.
970109851815890945 2018-03-03 01:33:07 UTC <luapski56> @vincentdonofrio As a Floridian,  I can tell you its not just the Senate.  The House is worse, and the Governor is a weasel looking to prop up votes for his Senate run in the fall.
970108169253998592 2018-03-03 01:26:25 UTC <luapski56> @MillenPolitics Well, if he can talk the NRA into propping up a few more weasels in the House and Senate, maybe he can pull it off. Sad!
969328473515921408 2018-03-01 21:48:11 UTC <luapski56> @CBSNews Well, maybe SHE is really a stable genius! Nah, JK.

969029531569938432 2018-02-28 02:00:18 UTC <luapski56> Uh oh. Better hope Mr. Magoo doesnt suddenly get a conscience and let it all hang out to Robert Mueller.https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/969028197324029953

967532606005874689 2018-02-24 22:52:03 UTC <luapski56> The blowback is obviously having an impact on the NRA if they have to spin it.

967112370903552000 2018-02-23 19:02:11 UTC <luapski56> Oh now Scott jumps on the gun restrictions bandwagon after Trump throws in his two cents worth.

966800767289094145 2018-02-22 22:23:59 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @JesseBWatters @FoxNews Ban assault weapons and 30 round clips. That would be a start.
966800106656862209 2018-02-22 22:21:22 UTC <luapski56> @MohamedMOSalih Sales were down and needed to broaden the customer base after almost 20 years. Its never-ending.
966702097130438659 2018-02-22 15:51:55 UTC <luapski56> @NRA @FoxNews Give Wayne credit, he has used every Buzz word in the White Supremacist play book today. If youre playing Buzzword Bingo its hard to keep up!
966701000978558976 2018-02-22 15:47:33 UTC <luapski56> @NRA @FoxNews Is that from the New Testament? Since owning a gun is a God given right, it must say that in the Bible some where, right?
966697038657269760 2018-02-22 15:31:49 UTC <luapski56> @NRA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Well, when they give you $30M you have to say thanks!
966447723955224577 2018-02-21 23:01:07 UTC <luapski56> Only in Florida. Our elected officials quickly extinguish any thoughts of even talking about banning assault weapons but are quicker to declare porn a public health risk!

966148964939718656 2018-02-20 03:13:58 UTC <luapski56> Kids from Parkland learning that NRA plays hardball here in Florida where they own the House, Senate, and Governor. Its an uphill battle, but has to start somewhere.https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/966142704685109248

966110926310080512 2018-02-20 00:42:48 UTC <luapski56> Really, we dont even pay them enough to teach let alone making them armed security. They have to buy their own supplies now, so I guess guns and ammo are now on that list?!https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/966037694764679170
965763229329784833 2018-02-19 01:41:11 UTC <luapski56> Well, I guess you get to think a lot about political correctness while sitting in a closet and listening to AR-15 rounds going by your head. They called BS on the NRA narrative here.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/965750408424644608
965762460526501889 2018-02-19 01:38:08 UTC <luapski56> Need to do a lot more than this. These kids are savvy, let them speak for their generation.https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/965750351046565888

965394198693326848 2018-02-18 01:14:47 UTC <luapski56> So just thinking out loud here, but is the membership at Mar-A-Lago the right focus group to be asking about gun control measures?

965068501156356100 2018-02-17 03:40:35 UTC <luapski56> What a difference a year makes. Want to be hopeful for the 2018 #Rays season, but looks like an uphill climb from here.https://twitter.com/tbtimes_rays/status/965040094951374848
964552218325155840 2018-02-16 17:29:04 UTC <luapski56> Most sane people will agree with this. Gun control alone is not the answer, we have to address the mental health aspect. To get healthy you need both diet and exercise. To fix the mass shooting problem is going to require both gun control and mental health changes.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/964450559095746560
964247993024221186 2018-02-15 21:20:11 UTC <luapski56> Read it directly from his NRA approved script, went back to his office and called his NRA handlers demanding more contributions ASAP. Please, we have to do better than this weasel and that is not by having Rick Scott join him in the Senate.https://twitter.com/cnn/status/964237321901105152
963961647340707842 2018-02-14 02:22:20 UTC <luapski56> Pam, is this the best the people of Florida can do?

926513767176986624 2017-11-03 18:17:50 UTC <luapski56> @krassenstein Hey, dont forget Papa John, hes in on this too!
925831971313475585 2017-11-01 21:08:37 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews So my math isnt too good, but 1 out of 24,000 seems like a pretty small percentage, right??
925825715207098368 2017-11-01 20:43:46 UTC <luapski56> @brookefoxnews @FoxNews Kinda like closing the barn door after all the animals got out.
925820609061445632 2017-11-01 20:23:28 UTC <luapski56> Ok, be on the lookout for a Trump tweet storm with this bit of news shortly! Taking a knee puts a dent in Papas profits. What next?!https://twitter.com/ap_nfl/status/925809433262936064
925342514839785472 2017-10-31 12:43:42 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @FoxNews Where there is smoke....its coming.
925341613647433728 2017-10-31 12:40:07 UTC <luapski56> While Rome is burning Fox sticks with ungrateful NFL narrative. Interesting.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/925337970827235328
925196935266529280 2017-10-30 03:05:13 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @FoxNews And Russia. Dont forget Russia.
925194963784216576 2017-10-30 02:57:23 UTC <luapski56> @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews You mean the Russian people?
925137405887369218 2017-10-30 23:08:40 UTC <luapski56> Wait for it......more to come.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/925134379390853120
924000218634473472 2017-10-27 19:49:53 UTC <luapski56> @nytimes Mike Pence nixed that. He might have to have lunch there without his wife being present.
922161593466736640 2017-10-22 18:03:51 UTC <luapski56> @KevinPhilpot Like Charlie Brown going to kick the football with Lucy holding. You know the outcome but have to try anyway.
919258049650577408 2017-10-14 17:46:12 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @FoxNews Verboten...I get it, secret code for his friends the neo-nazis. Very clever of him.
918184855548067841 2017-10-11 18:41:43 UTC <luapski56> @JustinTrudeau @POTUS @FoxNews That should scare the people of Canada immensely!
918181531738308609 2017-10-11 18:28:30 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews So Im guessing all the outraged people here didnt even read the article. No doubt this will be Trumps next diversionary subject.
917731403403550720 2017-10-10 12:39:51 UTC <luapski56> Ok. Maybe they could do this on pay-per-view! It would be better if they threw in Jeff Sessions and Scott Pruitt too. Like Battle Royale.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/917726165636395009
917579935459545088 2017-10-09 02:37:59 UTC <luapski56> Is this right? The Chinese go solar while we prop up coal? https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/917575419402113025
916693891604209664 2017-10-07 15:57:09 UTC <luapski56> @TheDemocrats @RepSeanDuffy @ffweekend @FoxNews He says as he holds out his hand to the NRA for more campaign contributions. Bought and paid for.
915989893519691781 2017-10-05 17:19:43 UTC <luapski56> @GillianHTurner @FoxNews In this case he was just speaking truth to power. Good job, Rex.
915202311244406785 2017-10-03 13:10:09 UTC <luapski56> A great loss, both musically and as an inspiration. So glad I got to see TP & the HB's on the 40th Anniversary tour in May! Don't back down!https://twitter.com/usatoday/status/915201031927197696
913233795524022272 2017-09-27 02:47:58 UTC <luapski56> @Cliff_Wolf Collapse in the second half was hard to watch. Every facet of their game was diminished. Hechavarria was a bright spot, but not much else.
913232863612547072 2017-09-27 02:44:16 UTC <luapski56> Meanwhile, Cubs clinch N.L. Central and head to the playoffs for the third straight year? Coincidence? Talk amongst yourselves.https://twitter.com/tbtimes_rays/status/913228975673049088
912841387397263360 2017-09-26 00:48:41 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @FoxNews Great Leader has spoken. Let it be so or death to those who dare speak against his words. This is how dictators get their start.
912794948365426693 2017-09-26 21:44:09 UTC <luapski56> And I whined like a baby when I didn't have power for 6 days. Really puts things in perspective. Grateful.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/912779316953526272
912778811510591488 2017-09-26 20:40:01 UTC <luapski56> @THEHermanCain @FoxNews Kinda like telling people they can't take a knee during the national anthem, right?
912661281341149185 2017-09-26 12:53:00 UTC <luapski56> @katiecouric Well reasoned and articulated. If you haven't read it, get the book "White Trash:The 400-year History of Class in America" by Nancy Isenberg
912503867203518464 2017-09-25 02:27:30 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @NFL @CarlHigbie @FoxNews @rash_jo Good night.
912502323120939008 2017-09-25 02:21:21 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @NFL @CarlHigbie @FoxNews @rash_jo Isn't about the flag. It's about racism being perpetrated by the lame president you are defending. Wake up. White supremacist attitude bad!
912498799351881730 2017-09-25 02:07:21 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @NFL @CarlHigbie @FoxNews @rash_jo Served 4 years in USAF so don't think I haven't done my share. Stand up for those who can't do it themselves. Walk a mile in the other shoes
912483853327065088 2017-09-25 01:07:58 UTC <luapski56> @real_defender Respectfully think you are full of it. Undoubtedly a privileged white boy who has never had to stand up for one thing in his life.
912483088017616896 2017-09-25 01:04:55 UTC <luapski56> Haha, Jerry Jones knows where his money is coming from.https://twitter.com/breaking911/status/912476692354097152
912482065475653632 2017-09-25 01:00:52 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @NFL @CarlHigbie @FoxNews @rash_jo So just curious how many years in the service have you put in? I want to understand the fervor here.
912459500120104960 2017-09-25 23:31:12 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @NFL @CarlHigbie @FoxNews I'll take that bet. Haven't seen the Vegas odds, but straight up still good. This isn't about patriotism, quit making it about that.
912403106247344129 2017-09-25 19:47:06 UTC <luapski56> Well, for once I agree with him. Obviously, he is not qualified so we should get someone who is.https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/912398644858454016
912401772211253248 2017-09-25 19:41:48 UTC <luapski56> Sorry Bill. The current occupant of the White House is busy bullying NFL and NBA players right now. Will schedule this in a day or two maybehttps://twitter.com/billclinton/status/912386484686204928
912296551929860096 2017-09-25 12:43:42 UTC <luapski56> @NASCAR @FoxNews Kinda like watching the Dukes of Hazzard...just a good ol boy....where is Daisy in all this anyway?
912295799912062976 2017-09-25 12:40:42 UTC <luapski56> @brookefoxnews @FoxNews Think Trump has ever watched a NASCAR race in his life? No, probably couldn't name a driver except maybe Richard Petty.
912295090105839616 2017-09-25 12:37:53 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews No need for that, it's all a bunch of good old white boys. No blacks and soon no women. Diversity doesn't exist in NASCAR in any form.
912077243438043137 2017-09-24 22:12:15 UTC <luapski56> This from the guy who took 5 deferments to keep from going to Vietnam and call Senator McCain a loser for being a POW. Not buying it.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/912072558320640000
912076449322082304 2017-09-24 22:09:05 UTC <luapski56> Oh, well then I totally missed that. Thanks for 'splainin it to the ignorant masses. Guess NASCAR got it right then. My bad.https://twitter.com/ap/status/912069890558881793
912047674228174848 2017-09-24 20:14:45 UTC <luapski56> A sport with zero black athletes and the only woman soon to be ousted sides with the white supremacist in the Oval Office. Makes sense.https://twitter.com/usatodaysports/status/912035064116019200
911644973560410112 2017-09-23 17:34:33 UTC <luapski56> Oh boy. Waiting on new Tweet from #DotardTrump with clever nickname for Iranian President Rouhani. #RocketMan used so more research needed.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/911634434440548353
910651541341777920 2017-09-20 23:47:01 UTC <luapski56> #Rays appear to be liking the return of John Lester to the #Trop. Too bad he didn't stay with the #Redsux !
910650403167055872 2017-09-20 23:42:29 UTC <luapski56> He hasn't read it. Doesn't know the personal or financial impacts to millions of citizens, but if it has Obama's name on it, it has to go!https://twitter.com/reuters/status/910649794280017920
905563936501661696 2017-09-06 22:50:41 UTC <luapski56> I bet the checking will only be happening if you are a Latino. Everyone wants to be the next Joe Arpaio and get a Trump pardon.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/905559246288367620
904824134324162560 2017-09-04 21:50:59 UTC <luapski56> This is truly impressive. I can barely get an open brew from the fridge to the recliner without spilling some!https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/904822714501910529
904748060491776003 2017-09-04 16:48:41 UTC <luapski56> @trish_regan @FoxNews Not nearly as scary as the thought of four more years of Donald Trump.
903376024968327168 2017-08-31 21:56:42 UTC <luapski56> @GovAbbott @FoxNews Well since this is the only one you've ever seen that makes sense. C'mon man.
902985317036249089 2017-08-30 20:04:10 UTC <luapski56> Wow. Mattress Mack understands the whole Christian concept better than Joel Osteen. What a great story and what a great human being.https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/902983137835278338

901273502594019328 2017-08-25 02:42:02 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @RealSheriffJoe @FoxNews Also supports neo-nazis and KKK.

900911066342936576 2017-08-24 02:41:50 UTC <luapski56> @DLoesch @FoxNews Donald Trump is the fertilizer on the seeds of activism. People haven't been this engaged since the 60's so at least we have that.
900522844072882180 2017-08-23 00:59:11 UTC <luapski56> @SteveKingIA @FoxNews He didn't win the popular vote. It's not a mandate, period.
900522186880012294 2017-08-23 00:56:34 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews Pretty soon he'll be begging for anyone that can tote a gun and pull the trigger to help the war effort in....Afghanistan, Korea, Iraq, etc.
900184007895375872 2017-08-22 02:32:46 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews Please, make him stop. No more campaigning, ever!
900181467619373057 2017-08-22 02:22:41 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @FoxNews Actually, we have faith that God will soon deliver us from your ineptitude and false bravado. Make America Whole Again.
900122670133649408 2017-08-22 22:29:02 UTC <luapski56> @KDTrey5 @Kaepernick7 @realDonaldTrump @GeorgeForeman @FoxNews George been hit in the head too many times.
900121053623668736 2017-08-22 22:22:37 UTC <luapski56> Seriously, is it ever going to end? Bad enough the voting public had to endure this for as long as we did already but now it's never ending.https://twitter.com/acosta/status/900100392217960448
899792113792991233 2017-08-21 00:35:31 UTC <luapski56> @WhitlockJason @FoxNews Pretty obvious this is BS since it seems to get air time and plenty of press coverage no matter where you look. The message is delivered.
898737512671301632 2017-08-18 02:44:55 UTC <luapski56> @AllenWest @FoxNews You forgot to say the FOX keyword...Obama. No prize for you.

896165353260175360 2017-08-11 00:24:04 UTC <luapski56> #Rays going down hard now. Defense bad, offense bad, pitching bad. Back to .500 baseball and that's as good as it gets. Sorry.
895752454444285952 2017-08-10 21:03:22 UTC <luapski56> Bet the poor folks on Guam are more than a little nervous about this kind of rhetoric. Now it's a game of chicken apparently.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/895747574107439106
895266776661073920 2017-08-09 12:53:27 UTC <luapski56> The fact that he even has to make this statement pretty much says it all. Crazy.https://twitter.com/cnn/status/895261176975814656
895113169823301632 2017-08-08 02:43:04 UTC <luapski56> @seanhannity @FoxNews Poll numbers are down so starting a war should fix that, right? The man is off his rocker.
895110948524089344 2017-08-08 02:34:15 UTC <luapski56> Well good golly, I hope not. This is the problem though, the people have no way of knowing. No more "speak softly but carry a big stick"!https://twitter.com/cnn/status/895109336825024513

895050491075448836 2017-08-08 22:34:00 UTC <luapski56> If this follows the Comey script next will be a dinner invite complete with tapes this time, then a demand for loyalty, followed by firing!https://twitter.com/newshour/status/895049314719879169

894347788502405121 2017-08-06 00:01:43 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews "Anything that gets Trump out of the White House is good for the country." There, fixed it for you!
894288371329232896 2017-08-06 20:05:37 UTC <luapski56> #Rays two different teams this year. First half offense hits on all cylinders, bullpen falters. Second half can't buy a run, bullpen great!

893937671218790400 2017-08-05 20:52:04 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews It's like whack-a-mole there @FoxNews , when one goes down up pops another one. #FireHannity must be looking over his shoulder a lot now.
893936087973990400 2017-08-05 20:45:46 UTC <luapski56> It's a frat house over there at @FoxNews . Taking a page out of the Anthony Weiner playbook. They'll have to play the JV team there soon!https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/893933220882001921
893863139716059137 2017-08-05 15:55:54 UTC <luapski56> @RaysFanGio Hard to believe he can get along better with Showalter. Maybe Buck giving him some tough love.
893654417467072513 2017-08-04 02:06:31 UTC <luapski56> #Rays suddenly have a bullpen that looks more than adequate and the offense fizzles. Frustrating isn't it?!
893626376598716417 2017-08-04 00:15:05 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews  joking right?

893223019707019265 2017-08-03 21:32:17 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @Varneyco @FoxNews @joeyd541 This Act has nothing to do with illegal immigration.
893217682048376833 2017-08-03 21:11:05 UTC <luapski56> @EboniKWilliams @FoxNews Exactly. So let's see if Donald tweets a little welcome to Mueller and the Grand Jury!
893201383872241665 2017-08-03 20:06:19 UTC <luapski56> Follow the money trail is always good advice.https://twitter.com/cnn/status/893200808690450432
893200363691618306 2017-08-03 20:02:16 UTC <luapski56> @RaysFanGio New Chief of Staff, first day on job booted him out cause he had a potty mouth!
893199889143926784 2017-08-03 20:00:23 UTC <luapski56> @RaysFanGio Brah, where you been? The guy that replaced him already got canned too. He lasted 11 days!
893199419667099650 2017-08-03 19:58:31 UTC <luapski56> @RaysFanGio Tony Gwynn. Pick one.
893198036293255169 2017-08-03 19:53:01 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @Varneyco @FoxNews @texafan123 Congratulations!
893196600251752448 2017-08-03 19:47:18 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @Varneyco @FoxNews @DPBLPatriot Seriously? Just what do you think this whole thing is about? It's not even cleverly concealed, just openly blatant.
893195455911350273 2017-08-03 19:42:46 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @Varneyco @FoxNews Well Stuart, you're white so that makes sense.
893158701913317376 2017-08-03 17:16:43 UTC <luapski56> @thelstattruns Your bar is pretty high! I'm happy if someone says "hey, looks like you've lost some weight"! 
892946480562143232 2017-08-02 03:13:25 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews @PaulT22PT @AmaierIRL @OhioPpl4Trump Obama, Obama, Obama....sniff sniff...Hillary did it...sniff sniff...please move on.
892936347182346240 2017-08-02 02:33:09 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews Why didn't GOP fix that problem? Had 7 years to get the plan together and still failed! Not winning.
892931251614748673 2017-08-02 02:12:54 UTC <luapski56> @seanhannity @FoxNews Stop the whining. Everyone ok with mueller until he started uncovering the dirt here. Nothing to hide? Let it slide!
892895724119183360 2017-08-02 23:51:44 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @FoxNews @planoldtired Backed up by more of the same. Sad.
892545425324081152 2017-08-01 00:39:46 UTC <luapski56> @watchingtherays C'mon, get us a W! #RaysUp
892500144503050240 2017-08-01 21:39:50 UTC <luapski56> @FBI @FoxNews Let's hope Trump let's him hold the office more than a week or two. The confirmation process takes a lot longer than that!
892486941282902019 2017-08-01 20:47:23 UTC <luapski56> Great pics from the Space Station. Tropical Storm Emily got nothing on this monster!https://twitter.com/astrokomrade/status/892475089819639808
892432072673046531 2017-08-01 17:09:21 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews If his new Chief of Staff is smart, he will talk Trump back from this. The downside outweighs anything positive that he might get here.
892431316028928000 2017-08-01 17:06:20 UTC <luapski56> @NewsHour Another plan with an aggressive timeline, like healthcare. Haste makes waste. Not to mention bad decisions. How many tries to get this done?
892183414979391489 2017-07-31 00:41:16 UTC <luapski56> @David_Bossie @FoxNews This is the problem. Every week there is a new sheriff in town. The posse doesn't know which way to go. Sad!
892140438425149440 2017-07-31 21:50:30 UTC <luapski56> @AnnCoulter @FoxNews That's what you need now Donald, advice from Ann Coulter. NOT. No more firing and replacing, put this to bed. Idiots.
892120105609506816 2017-07-31 20:29:42 UTC <luapski56> @Cliff_Wolf They should have just done player to be named later and left it at that! Or maybe cash considerations, but nooooooo!
892118631810772992 2017-07-31 20:23:51 UTC <luapski56> @DanSaavedra4 Must be his last base-running blunder pushed it over the edge! I think it was attitude since the trade for Hechavarria. Otherwise I'm blank.
892096187666509829 2017-07-31 18:54:40 UTC <luapski56> @WhiteHouse @Scaramucci @FoxNews The General is in charge now Moochie! That kinda Effs up your day doesn't it?!
891097508218380288 2017-07-28 00:46:16 UTC <luapski56> @newtgingrich @FoxNews Newt needs to suck his own...never mind.
891096945607016448 2017-07-28 00:44:02 UTC <luapski56> #Rays looking pretty meek against Tanaka through 6 innings here at #Yankees stadium. No playoff baseball with this offense. Need runs!
891094055702196224 2017-07-28 00:32:33 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews Basically said rough them up every chance you get and this administration will back you up every chance we get. WOW!
890974539190071297 2017-07-28 16:37:38 UTC <luapski56> @Cliff_Wolf And he really rocked that DJ Kitty Onesie too!
890757162414243841 2017-07-27 02:13:51 UTC <luapski56> #Rays escape with just the one run in the 8th and head to the 9th up 5-4. Think we're gonna need some insurance here guys! #RaysUp
890752080306163712 2017-07-27 01:53:39 UTC <luapski56> @JesseBWatters @FoxNews Face it, they got nothing. No winning here.
890750999564103680 2017-07-27 01:49:22 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Romo with a nice 7th inning only giving up the single to Judge. Time to add on here boys! #RaysUp
890285708476329984 2017-07-26 19:00:28 UTC <luapski56> #Rays get a nice get-away day victory over the #Orioles 5-1 and take 2 out of 3 in the series. Hopefully a little MoJo back for the road!
890283074654699521 2017-07-26 18:50:00 UTC <luapski56> #Rays making #Orioles bullpen look a bit woeful here late! Let's make that 5-1 lead hold up here guys! #RaysUp
889674653769371650 2017-07-24 02:32:21 UTC <luapski56> @GOP @AriFleischer @FoxNews Well, except there won't be a sky because we've torn down any regulation that might protect our environment from these jokers.
889673644041019392 2017-07-24 02:28:20 UTC <luapski56> Now the Boy Scouts have become the forum for political rants. The youth of America getting an early dose of hate from our president. Sad.https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/889664140905545728
889671534163439617 2017-07-24 02:19:57 UTC <luapski56> @AP Problem is he's running out of relatives to plug in to these positions. Might have to start bringing in ex-wives soon.
889546375377113089 2017-07-24 18:02:37 UTC <luapski56> Those same fans had us going to the WS when we took 3 out 4 from BoSox prior to break. Reality is we are a .500 team with current personnel.https://twitter.com/tbtimes_rays/status/889505480212721664
889243447986708481 2017-07-23 21:58:54 UTC <luapski56> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Why didn't he just retweet it? I mean it's the same thing he says every day. Save the fingers dude.
889240978426646533 2017-07-23 21:49:05 UTC <luapski56> @RaysFan4Real The Rangers own the Rays at the Trop. Regular season or playoffs it doesn't matter. Works out better when we play at their house.
888814751337328640 2017-07-22 17:35:24 UTC <luapski56> @KevinPhilpot Not disagreeing with the choice, and think it was the choice he should have made in the Sox game. Cobb backed him when he got pulled before.
888813295825805312 2017-07-22 17:29:37 UTC <luapski56> @KevinPhilpot From managerial perspective if you go to your closer to start a clean ninth which Cash said was logic then, what was different last night?
888808458480386080 2017-07-22 17:10:24 UTC <luapski56> @TBTimes_Rays @KevinPhilpot My only problem here is the inconsistency in that situation. Last time Cobb in almost identical situation gets pulled so what changed?
888455553613221888 2017-07-21 17:48:05 UTC <luapski56> @suzynuze And anyone who willingly goes to work for him should have their head examined. He demands loyalty but gives none and has no honor code. Sad.
888446296671105025 2017-07-21 17:11:18 UTC <luapski56> @WhiteHouse @Scaramucci @FoxNews This guy was probably a used car salesman at some point. Seriously, the guy who runs out at you when you walk on the lot!
888190706682122240 2017-07-20 00:15:40 UTC <luapski56> @GOP @FoxNews That's the answer to stupidity, more money!
888187720589357056 2017-07-20 00:03:48 UTC <luapski56> @brianstelter @POTUS @CNNMoney Simple answer, he was looking for a way to throw Jeff Sessions under the bus and walk away. Republicans eating their own every day now.
888043431330754560 2017-07-20 14:30:27 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @SenJohnMcCain @BarackObama @FoxNews A thoughtful message that got over 1 million likes. Not the mailed in message from @Potus.
888041735330377728 2017-07-20 14:23:43 UTC <luapski56> @AudiophiliacMan Nice. What is the black base that it is sitting on? Might need one of those!
888040394243670017 2017-07-20 14:18:23 UTC <luapski56> @SenJohnMcCain @SarahPalinUSA @FoxNews Oddly enough, I'm going to agree with you for once Sarah, especially if the only other choice is the nimrod in the White House today.
888032284124860416 2017-07-20 13:46:10 UTC <luapski56> @brookefoxnews @FoxNews @foxnewspolitics Republicans starting to eat their own now so you know things are going downhill fast. Six months of Trump is all it took.
887773770508881920 2017-07-19 20:38:55 UTC <luapski56> #Rays playing scrappy baseball and taking advantage of every opportunity to take a 2-0 lead in the 4th! #RaysUp

887429853850595328 2017-07-18 21:52:19 UTC <luapski56> @david_avella @FoxNews Donald Trump is a bad actor. I mean anyone can do reality TV, right?
887429575642406912 2017-07-18 21:51:13 UTC <luapski56> @CNN Guess everyone should hope that the Senate isn't involved in it either.
887417588246097923 2017-07-18 21:03:35 UTC <luapski56> @NewsHour Gosh, whatever happened to "The Buck Stops Here"? You're the President, you own it!
887417249119776768 2017-07-18 21:02:14 UTC <luapski56> @CNN They probably don't have much to worry about there. Should be most concerned with the American people and doing the right thing.
887411346828079106 2017-07-18 20:38:47 UTC <luapski56> @subvertiser @a_treaclemine @BadAssDuJour Do you think they will allow that on the sidewalks around the White House?!
887393832228225024 2017-07-18 19:29:11 UTC <luapski56> @CBSNews The White House propaganda machine is in high gear now. Talk about the MSM, this makes them look like rank amateurs.

887366337424752640 2017-07-18 17:39:55 UTC <luapski56> @CNN That's a plan? Alrighty then, let's see how that plays in 2020.
887365307442102272 2017-07-18 17:35:50 UTC <luapski56> @thelstattruns A couple hundred years of BAU and the country manages to survive. 6 months of Trump and we need to rearrange the rules for him. No thanks!

887329589068001281 2017-07-18 15:13:54 UTC <luapski56> @brookefoxnews @FoxNews If you can't win then just change the rules. That's the Trump way.
887323890032283648 2017-07-18 14:51:15 UTC <luapski56> @CNN Cutting off their noses to spite their faces. Anything from Obama must go no matter the cost to the American people. Pathetic.

884145070827548673 2017-07-09 20:19:46 UTC <luapski56> #Rays WooHoo Baby. 3 out of 4 from the AL East leading #RedSox and another series win. That's how you get to the playoffs. #RaysUp
884143083784482816 2017-07-09 20:11:52 UTC <luapski56> This umpire will be a problem for #Rays Colome and who lives at the bottom of the strike zone. Umpire giving high strike last few batters.
884142489548050434 2017-07-09 20:09:30 UTC <luapski56> @Cliff_Wolf You are psychotic!

883822112993140737 2017-07-08 22:56:27 UTC <luapski56> I will say that if the #Rays somehow make the playoffs fans will already be numb to high pressure late inning situations so there's that!
883142044448948225 2017-07-06 01:54:06 UTC <luapski56> Colome looks more like his old self and #Rays hang on for an impressive 4-1 win against the #RedSox to open the 4 game series at the Trop!
883139901306417153 2017-07-06 01:45:35 UTC <luapski56> Me in #Rays top of the ninth inning! Let's win this thing! Please??! #RaysUppic.twitter.com/1rudeKQ49J

883132833455329280 2017-07-06 01:17:29 UTC <luapski56> Dwayne says the #Rays trying to stabilize this part of the pen in getting to the closer. That's true, but need to stabilize the closer also!
883130287227625476 2017-07-06 01:07:22 UTC <luapski56> The Buffalo gives the #Rays a 4-1 lead with a bomb to left! This guy has been a huge upgrade at catcher, both defensively and offensively!
883128650543095808 2017-07-06 01:00:52 UTC <luapski56> #Rays really need to send Faria back out for the 7th! I know, he's just under 100 pitches, but the less bullpen the better our chances!
883123546142236673 2017-07-06 00:40:35 UTC <luapski56> #Rays game plan tonight should be Faria throws a complete game no matter how many pitches it takes!
883120270332112896 2017-07-06 00:27:34 UTC <luapski56> #Rays LoMo showing his wheels scoring from first on the single by the Buffalo and the game is tied!
883052558142627841 2017-07-06 19:58:30 UTC <luapski56> Getting down to the wire to get your #GOLOMO on! #GOLOMO !

882435240945487872 2017-07-04 03:05:30 UTC <luapski56> Saw the champion ate 72 hot dogs in 10 minutes today and quit training. I mean who can keep up with that? Over 20,000 calories? Impressive!
882354734576922625 2017-07-04 21:45:36 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Colome makes every outing an adventure! Hanging on by the skin of his teeth to close it out for the win!
882335234649456640 2017-07-04 20:28:07 UTC <luapski56> #Rays getting a reminder of Joe Maddon small ball with Contreras putting down a perfect bunt for a base hit and this is trouble.
882326265302319104 2017-07-04 19:52:29 UTC <luapski56> That was without a doubt Archer's most impressive inning in the game thus far. Overpowering with the fastball. More offense please #Rays !
882322293208342528 2017-07-04 19:36:42 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Archer adding to Lester's woes in the 4th with his first base hit and an RBI for the 4-1 lead. So sweet against Lester, love it!!

882314979566899201 2017-07-04 19:07:38 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Souza with the unexpected quick bunt down third base side works well against Lester.
881676376906113028 2017-07-02 00:50:03 UTC <luapski56> I just voted to send Logan Morrison to the 2017 #ASG! Help him win the Final Vote! http://atmlb.com/2sb1smz #RaysUp

881311325678440448 2017-07-01 00:39:28 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Victory!!
881310724122963968 2017-07-01 00:37:05 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Featherston should not have caught that error. Hechavarria should have taken that across the bag for the double play. Communicate!
881308601565970432 2017-07-01 00:28:39 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Ramos is really impressing both at the plate and behind it. This is an upgrade over Norris, especially defensively.
881307600771579904 2017-07-01 00:24:40 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews And the other folks just don't care I guess. Wait until you need some of that medical insurance and let's see how it feels.
881306795322507265 2017-07-01 00:21:28 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Ramirez gets out of the jam in the bottom of the 8th and we go to the ninth leading 10-3 over #Orioles. #RaysUp

881222455414620161 2017-07-01 18:46:20 UTC <luapski56> Ok. I like the 4th of July #Rays cap. Might have to snag one of these.https://twitter.com/tbtimes_rays/status/881198349470355457

880955988261711872 2017-06-30 01:07:29 UTC <luapski56> #Rays get nothing after having bases loaded and no outs. WOW! That is just not acceptable if you think you are going to the playoffs!
880948407313072130 2017-06-30 00:37:22 UTC <luapski56> What's happened to #Rays offensive production here in the last 5 games? If that goes away this will turn into a long second half for us.
880942405314375680 2017-06-30 00:13:31 UTC <luapski56> #Rays with two stellar defensive plays to get out of the inning after #Orioles score and still lead 2-1.

880590673774358528 2017-06-29 00:55:51 UTC <luapski56> #Rays offense suddenly missing in action. Hmmmm....don't tell me Derek Norris was the key! Ok, I know that's not likely but still. Whatup??
880584316237082624 2017-06-29 00:30:36 UTC <luapski56> #Rays All-Star Dickerson with a stellar catch in left to end the fourth after Jaso launched a bomb to give the #Pirates a 2-0 lead.
880232465998254080 2017-06-28 01:12:28 UTC <luapski56> #Rays get a runner to third with one out and cannot push it across. Wow!
880230989292818432 2017-06-28 01:06:36 UTC <luapski56> @Cliff_Wolf I'd like to be as kind, but this is just hard to watch. So much potential just seems to be wasted. What do I know?!
880230453613129729 2017-06-28 01:04:28 UTC <luapski56> Once upon a time you would not have said #Rays pitching was the team weakness. This year, that seems to be the case, starters and bullpen.
880223085835767808 2017-06-28 00:35:12 UTC <luapski56> #Rays wasting another lead-off base-runner and still trail 4-2.
880221250492264449 2017-06-28 00:27:54 UTC <luapski56> @thelstattruns Ok then. Stand down for the evening and hit it hard again in the a.m. :)
880220781652975624 2017-06-28 00:26:02 UTC <luapski56> @thelstattruns It's early and there's still light so you probably have time to log a few miles before bed time!
880219524150198277 2017-06-28 00:21:02 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Snell gets two quick strikes on great pitches then can't find the put-away pitch. Great pickup by Beckham to save the out.
880218474991284225 2017-06-28 00:16:52 UTC <luapski56> #Rays I'm going to get greedy now. Leaving the bases loaded after scoring 1 run on a sac fly is leaving a lot on the table! Pick it up!
880214878564253697 2017-06-28 00:02:35 UTC <luapski56> @TobyDavid Think a lot of Snell's problem is in his head. His stuff is more than adequate to compete at the MLB level, but he can't keep his mind in it
880102850101219328 2017-06-28 16:37:25 UTC <luapski56> @maristpoll @NPR @NewsHour The genie is out of the bottle now and there is no going back. Trump made promises that the Republicans are now saddled with.
880101759733161985 2017-06-28 16:33:05 UTC <luapski56> @TBTimes_Rays Give credit to Cobb for promoting team before self concept. Still think he should have gone out for the ninth though.
880099457538416640 2017-06-28 16:23:56 UTC <luapski56> @KennedyNation @FoxNews Big healthcare companies with bottomless pockets for bribes in Washington kill healthcare for all. Greed is the disease here.

879885933595721729 2017-06-27 02:15:28 UTC <luapski56> @Ry_Bass I hope he is suitably embarrassed about that!
879885673154719744 2017-06-27 02:14:26 UTC <luapski56> #Rays win in spite of Kevin Cash!

879877050928177152 2017-06-27 01:40:10 UTC <luapski56> @TobyDavid I'm going to second guess this move just because Cobb was still in total control.
879873715907039232 2017-06-27 01:26:55 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Cobb gets through 8 innings without giving up a run and is just under 100 pitches. I say send him back out for the ninth!
879872107794108417 2017-06-27 01:20:32 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Mallex Smith caught in pitch-out, but Corey Dickerson gets to lead off next inning. That was a good risk.
879871105208549384 2017-06-27 01:16:33 UTC <luapski56> With  #Rays Dickerson up and Mallex Smith on first wouldn't you play run and hit here?

875168493116805121 2017-06-14 01:50:03 UTC <luapski56> @KevinPhilpot Almost knuckleball at times.

875166043286720512 2017-06-14 01:40:19 UTC <luapski56> @TheJuanWilliams @FoxNews @phylumt I mean regardless of whomever they support. Mental illness doesn't have a party affiliation. Can we agree on that?
875163201041838080 2017-06-14 01:29:01 UTC <luapski56> @TheJuanWilliams @FoxNews And let's not let mentally ill people get their hands on firearms of any sort. Seems simple enough.
875162230676959232 2017-06-14 01:25:10 UTC <luapski56> @CNN @BenTps Sources? Links? Truth? I didn't think so.

875159708184838144 2017-06-14 01:15:08 UTC <luapski56> @CNN @BenTps Yes, really.
875157838305386496 2017-06-14 01:07:42 UTC <luapski56> @CNN This guy is a huge part of the problem. Constantly fanning the flames of hate. He needs to go away.

874607469020028929 2017-06-13 12:40:44 UTC <luapski56> Poor Newt, can't make up his mind. And now Trump talking about firing Mueller! Wow, that won't look suspicious at all. Where there's smoke..https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/874603518073688066

873217249527705604 2017-06-09 16:36:30 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @trish_regan @FoxNews The problem is he's all out of relatives to put into those team positions. Maybe Barron has an opportunity here somewhere.
873173594842464256 2017-06-09 13:43:02 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews His defense is "Comey is a leaker"! That probably isn't going to hold up well against obstruction charges.
872942665217847297 2017-06-08 22:25:24 UTC <luapski56> @realDonaldTrump @Reuters It's obvious that Trump's lawyer muzzled him in a way no one else has been able to do. Will it last? Not likely!
872940468786655232 2017-06-08 22:16:40 UTC <luapski56> Well, at least there's this!https://twitter.com/peanuts_comics/status/872821027025244160

872937777519874049 2017-06-08 22:05:59 UTC <luapski56> @CNN Sounds like Brexit is Broken before it can even get off the ground. This is the Trump effect in full force. #Resist
872935620779409408 2017-06-08 21:57:25 UTC <luapski56> @CNNMoney So basically the swamp wins again. Already forgotten the Great Recession and what caused it in the first place. Too big to fail.
872934266203779074 2017-06-08 21:52:02 UTC <luapski56> @CNN British learning lessons from Trump's version of America and not liking what they see. #Resist

872927029380960258 2017-06-08 21:23:16 UTC <luapski56> @CNN Wow, what happened to draining the swamp? This guy is a snake.

872893397270487040 2017-06-08 19:09:38 UTC <luapski56> @AP Stalling your own agenda sir. You control the House, Senate, and Presidency. If you can't work with that you have a problem.
872891984444346370 2017-06-08 19:04:01 UTC <luapski56> @BBCNorthAmerica @BBCJamesCook Hard to believe anything the orange haired guy says. If his lips are moving or he's on a Twitter rant he's probably not telling the truth.

872888481760071681 2017-06-08 18:50:06 UTC <luapski56> @PhilipRucker Still waiting to hear Trump's tapes. If they exist, let's clear this up once and for all.
872871593801904130 2017-06-08 17:42:59 UTC <luapski56> @CNN Which is worse, Ryan's defense of Trump or the fact that Trump is so clueless in the first place? Tough one.
872869475070214145 2017-06-08 17:34:34 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews The "nut job" here is the guy with orange hair.
872868779419738112 2017-06-08 17:31:48 UTC <luapski56> @marcorubio @FoxNews Little Marco paying Trump back for dinner the other night. Sad!

872866424561295360 2017-06-08 17:22:27 UTC <luapski56> @thelstattruns Funny! But maybe it's time to think outside the "box"!
872635202379689985 2017-06-07 02:03:39 UTC <luapski56> #Rays finally back in the win column with a nice debut by Faria and good bullpen work to hold on 3-1.
872284725242720256 2017-06-06 02:50:59 UTC <luapski56> @CNNMoney Right. And instead of a piece of chocolate on your pillow after check-in you get a lump of coal. Also, free cable, but FOX is only channel.
872281140236873729 2017-06-06 02:36:44 UTC <luapski56> That's just a coincidence folks. Nothing to see here, please move along. Tweets at 11:00 from @POTUS  account.https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/872104030457221120
870763825947189248 2017-06-02 22:07:28 UTC <luapski56> @TomBevanRCP @FoxNews I'd like to know if it will be covered under the new GOP healthcare plan or is it considered a pre-existing condition? I think I have it now
870736650573410304 2017-06-02 20:19:29 UTC <luapski56> @TeamCavuto @FoxNews Exactly, a "Chill Pill" is what this is all about. The longer we wait the hotter it gets.
869741365986504704 2017-05-30 02:24:35 UTC <luapski56> #Rays get nothing after a promising start to the 7th there with 2 on and nobody out. That kinda hurts.
868462541093130241 2017-05-27 13:42:59 UTC <luapski56> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews After Steve Bannon tells me what I should do.

867834210035396608 2017-05-25 20:06:13 UTC <luapski56> Imagine it if the Trop had real grass in the outfield. Grass stains and dirt your Mom would have problems getting out. It's a good look!https://twitter.com/raysbaseball/status/867829809144971264
867556823699771393 2017-05-24 01:43:59 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Stanek very impressive with the strike outs of Trout and Pujols in the 8th. More runs please!
867555435460648960 2017-05-24 01:38:28 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Stanek with the 1 out walk and now Trout to the plate. Every pitch counts.
866835615865864193 2017-05-22 01:58:10 UTC <luapski56> #Rays bull pen continues to be the soft spot in the organization. In fairness, offense has been less than stellar tonight, but pitching....
866832482053894144 2017-05-22 01:45:43 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Robertson continues to impress with clutch offense and defense. This kid looks like the real deal. Hope they find a spot for him.
866829586348355588 2017-05-22 01:34:12 UTC <luapski56> #Rays very fortunate to escape the bases loaded situation after only giving up one run in the 7th. Going to need some offense late here.

866049492889600000 2017-05-20 21:54:24 UTC <luapski56> Thinking that is going to hurt before this is over. #Rays could have probably nailed it down with a couple more there. Bullpen issues!https://twitter.com/tbtimes_rays/status/866048814033063937
865756081468964864 2017-05-19 02:28:29 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Colome with a tidy ninth to seal the 5-4 win over the #Yankees to start the home stand. #RaysUp
865752034473127937 2017-05-19 02:12:24 UTC <luapski56> Looking at #Yankees Clippard makes me think about when Kyle Farnsworth was in the #Rays bullpen once upon a time. Kinda miss him at times!

865725575503261696 2017-05-19 00:27:16 UTC <luapski56> @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews FOX going down with Trump. Trying to bail out this sinking administration but it's too little too late. It's going to sink on its own.
865314066247680000 2017-05-18 21:12:04 UTC <luapski56> @thelstattruns Sadly, Donald Trump is wrong with America. Bullying and divisiveness are being encouraged by his behavior as president. IMHO

864927493236588544 2017-05-17 19:35:58 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews Wow, he had that called right. Give him credit on that one.
864926870747443200 2017-05-17 19:33:30 UTC <luapski56> @BBCNorthAmerica Well there he goes winning again. He's at the top of the "treated unfairly by media" board. He just can't stop winning believe me.

864546188284108800 2017-05-16 18:20:48 UTC <luapski56> @NewsHour Smart man. He can see the wheels are about to come off the Trump crazy train and wants to keep his name clear of that fiasco.

862840503137710080 2017-05-11 01:23:01 UTC <luapski56> @RobertGBeckel @FoxNews Let's just get to the truth. Forget the party line, where do the American people get to hear the truth in any of this?
862834969340780544 2017-05-11 01:01:02 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews Forget all the partisan crap here. Let's get to the bottom of it all. If Clinton broke the law put her on trial, if Trump did it the same.

862484581894819840 2017-05-10 01:48:43 UTC <luapski56> #Rays with an even dozen runs through 8 and hopefully even the bullpen can't let this one get away!
862481564826992646 2017-05-10 01:36:43 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Archer with a pretty dominant performance through 8 innings to preserve the 7-0 lead tonight. Let's give the bullpen tonight off!!
862464899418554368 2017-05-10 00:30:30 UTC <luapski56> Uh oh. A 6-0 lead now for the #Rays so the #Royals are thinking "now we have them right where we want them". Prove them wrong tonight!https://twitter.com/tbtimes_rays/status/862464027015995392
862137270702419969 2017-05-09 02:48:37 UTC <luapski56> Well, that is timely. Should be a pleasant conversation about all things Russian.https://twitter.com/kellyo/status/862135015890616320
862075904687841280 2017-05-09 22:44:46 UTC <luapski56> Yes, This!https://twitter.com/nycjayjay/status/862075224216547330
862074482487414786 2017-05-09 22:39:07 UTC <luapski56> "Nixonian"! I like that word, it really says a lot about the current administration.https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/862073069040533504
860678649888092160 2017-05-05 02:12:35 UTC <luapski56> Good night #Rays fans. Better luck tomorrow.
860677803104141312 2017-05-05 02:09:13 UTC <luapski56> If the #Rays end up losing this game it has to go squarely back on Cash for leaving Archer in with over 100 pitches to face Morales in 7th.
860673990695825408 2017-05-05 01:54:04 UTC <luapski56> Good base running by #Rays Longoria to score on the chopper to first and take the lead back in the bottom of the 7th. should have had more!
860668436493586432 2017-05-05 01:32:00 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Archer gives up the two run bomb to Morales and the game is tied now. Sigh.
860667786770735106 2017-05-05 01:29:25 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Archer Cher gives up the lead-off walk to start the seventh and is now over 100 pitches. Needs a twin-killing to get this back now.
860662146765651968 2017-05-05 01:07:00 UTC <luapski56> @Reuters Wait, what? I thought he said they had a great health care system. Why should we not look into that as a possible model for the U.S.?
860661369833742337 2017-05-05 01:03:55 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews Seems fair. Bunch of old white guys deciding things with about zero diverse input from anywhere. Still 1950's in Congress.
860660659503194113 2017-05-05 01:01:06 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Archer gets out of trouble after giving up the one run in the top of the 5th and #Rays still lead 3-1.
860613896855580672 2017-05-05 21:55:17 UTC <luapski56> @CBSNews Hey, he's from Australia and as @realDonaldTrump has told everyone they have great health coverage there so he should be fine!
860612440865820672 2017-05-05 21:49:29 UTC <luapski56> I mean really, who doesn't like baby otters?!https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/860605071763091459
860604993598095362 2017-05-05 21:19:54 UTC <luapski56> @realDonaldTrump @USATODAY So we're still looking for a few good men...oh wait, that's the Marines, never mind.

860317059535732736 2017-05-04 02:15:45 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Hu starts the 9th with a 4 pitch walk and a groan goes up from all 10k fans at the Trop. Now defense falters and here we go again.
860312341354774530 2017-05-04 01:57:00 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Farquhar with trouble finding the strike zone and once again bullpen issues rear up to put a good game in jeopardy late. #RaysUp

860305768083599360 2017-05-04 01:30:53 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Kiermaier with the accidental single off the pitcher's glove to score another run against the #Marlins. 5-0 end of six innings.
860294744789966848 2017-05-04 00:47:05 UTC <luapski56> #Rays leave the sacks full on the Kiermaier ground out but score two on Tim Beckham's second homer of the night to take a 4-0 lead.
860284587179745280 2017-05-04 00:06:43 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Andriese works himself out of his own jam to get out of the third without the #Marlins pushing anything across. Still 2-0 #RaysUp
860236784176943108 2017-05-04 20:56:46 UTC <luapski56> @LizWFB @FoxNews The key word being "desperately"!
860227836497494017 2017-05-04 20:21:13 UTC <luapski56> Now this is good news. Thanks to House Freedom Caucus Trumpcare is a lot less bad than it could have been. Start feeling better America!https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/860223729636454400
860169458819661824 2017-05-04 16:29:14 UTC <luapski56> @USATODAY Now that's a dryyyyyy martini 
859947119653916673 2017-05-03 01:45:45 UTC <luapski56> #Rays get back to .500 and stall there. This might be just as good as it gets for this season without a talent infusion soon. Kinda ugly.
859939875025559554 2017-05-03 01:16:57 UTC <luapski56> #Rays wow this game just got totally ugly in the top of the sixth. Bullpen problems rearing the head again with the short start from Snell.
859596998542053376 2017-05-02 02:34:29 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Colome gets the save and #Rays take second game on the road against the #Marlins 3-1. ##RaysUp
859592403061178368 2017-05-02 02:16:14 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Robertson continues to impress with his play at third in Longoria's absence. Great play to get Ichirro there to end the 8th.
859582166744915970 2017-05-02 01:35:33 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Cobb doing bulldog things and keeping the #Marlins without a run through the 6th. Wonder if Cash considers letting him open the 7th?
859576191757541376 2017-05-02 01:11:48 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Cobb what a great play on the come-backer to the mound. Holds the #Marlins at bay after first two reach base in the 5th.
859552449278955521 2017-05-02 23:37:28 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @RepPeteKing @FoxNews Putin throwing Trump a bone here on Syria to prop his boy up amid continually sagging ratings. The story continues.
859232944032022532 2017-05-01 02:27:52 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Colome with a stellar 9th to seal the 4-2 victory against the #Marlins.

859228462174932993 2017-05-01 02:10:03 UTC <luapski56> #Rays bullpen again becomes the focal point in a close game. No lefties down there for match-ups with left handed hitters so there's that!
859225563785048064 2017-05-01 01:58:32 UTC <luapski56> @CNN Whatever happened to Win-Win where everybody gets some of what they want, but nobody gets all of what they want? Is that what this is? Hope!
859224469956689920 2017-05-01 01:54:11 UTC <luapski56> @AP Why does this announcement come from the South Koreans instead of the U.S. military or government spokespeople? Whose system is it?
859223625978826752 2017-05-01 01:50:50 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Robertson with a great at bat there working the count and stroking it for a single to left center to score Miller from third.
859221436107554818 2017-05-01 01:42:08 UTC <luapski56> @CNN Be careful Mr. President that evil Obama might have your phone tapped there and listen in.
859216923128737793 2017-05-01 01:24:12 UTC <luapski56> #Rays get the benefit of review call on Kiermaier's slide into second and the run counts. That rule is full of holes and then some. IMHO!
859212347222757376 2017-05-01 01:06:01 UTC <luapski56> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Well there ya go. Better late than never. Had to look it up in the history books to confirm.
859211264698064899 2017-05-01 01:01:43 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Farquhar with a pretty nice three up three down in the bottom of the sixth. Still tied at 2.
859210645039964160 2017-05-01 00:59:15 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Robertson with a nice pic and throw on the run with that last ground ball to third.

859171409599356928 2017-05-01 22:23:21 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews If the North Koreans are like us they will paint a picture of @POTUS on the next missile before they launch and post it on Twitter!
858804810941911040 2017-04-30 22:06:37 UTC <luapski56> @larryelder @FoxNews Ok FOX, I like this. The use of "decried" instead of "slammed" is a nice touch here.
858804451934695424 2017-04-30 22:05:11 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews Hey Fabio, maybe you'll be in the next round of deportations! Be careful.
858804069116325888 2017-04-30 22:03:40 UTC <luapski56> @JerryFalwellJr @FoxNews Good FOX. No "slamming" of anything here, just commenting. Jerry Falwell doesn't "slam", although he might "thump" as in his Bible.
858803447902199808 2017-04-30 22:01:12 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @dbongino @ffweekend @FoxNews Oops, more "slamming" now on FOX. People who slam are more powerful than people who present rational and well founded arguments, right?
858802779799916544 2017-04-30 21:58:33 UTC <luapski56> @michellemalkin @FoxNews Another "slammer"! Everyone on FOX slams something. They don't just disagree, they Slam! Power in slamming.
858801026673102848 2017-04-30 21:51:35 UTC <luapski56> @larryelder @FoxNews Uh oh, someone else "slamming" something not a door. Please make it stop.
858800333115543553 2017-04-30 21:48:49 UTC <luapski56> @SenSchumer @POTUS @FoxNews Hey FOX, get a new word besides "slammed." Loses effect when it used so much.
858500518704029696 2017-04-29 01:57:28 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @FoxNews Remember when a Catholic couldn't even think about being President? Please, whole WASP thing is so 1960's. Separation of church and state.

857769557838237697 2017-04-27 01:32:53 UTC <luapski56> @FoxNews I bet that 53% doesn't have children that are of the age to have to serve in any armed conflict with the North Koreans. Think about it.
857712622849937408 2017-04-27 21:46:39 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @kimguilfoyle @FoxNews Jim Jones never lost the support of his core group either. Careful of the kool-aid.
857420432990973952 2017-04-26 02:25:35 UTC <luapski56> Is it just me or does #Rays Sucre look better framing pitches than Norris? Sucre seems more fluid and with softer hands behind the plate.

850041350464708608 2017-04-06 17:43:45 UTC <luapski56> @thelstattruns I said violets before, those were pansies! Here are the violets. Didn't want to mislead there!pic.twitter.com/6deA4vbPOV
850033895508766720 2017-04-06 17:14:08 UTC <luapski56> @bigpaulyb Kinda sad isn't it. We are so politically broken now that no one is willing to meet in the middle for anything. Seems like we could do more.
850032405297680387 2017-04-06 17:08:12 UTC <luapski56> @thelstattruns How about violets? My grandmother was a china painter and those were some of her favorites.pic.twitter.com/2LxkN5tNcI
849810847421665280 2017-04-05 02:27:49 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Colome looking like the center bumper on a pinball machine in the 9th but gets the job done. Nice win over the #Yankees tonight.

849750343227510784 2017-04-05 22:27:24 UTC <luapski56> Maybe he is praying for a hit. Hey, whatever works. #RaysUphttps://twitter.com/tbtimes_rays/status/849698505161670657
848709402563620864 2017-04-02 01:31:04 UTC <luapski56> #Cubs Schwarber is 2 for 2 in the lead off spot so far tonight. If he stays healthy this year he will be huge in that spot.
848691759601377280 2017-04-02 00:20:58 UTC <luapski56> @USATODAY Well, that's setting the bar pretty low. Are we going to settle for this?

847571409215913985 2017-03-30 22:09:05 UTC <luapski56> Interesting. The other one that stands out is Border Wall at 7% for Trump voters and 3% overall in terms of priorities. Jobs and ISIS tops.https://twitter.com/aedwardslevy/status/847208401897697280

847225839468986369 2017-03-29 23:15:55 UTC <luapski56> @SenatorBurr @FoxNews The problem is, so far the American people have not heard one credible word about anything. When can we expect that?
846795611273920512 2017-03-28 18:46:21 UTC <luapski56> @RaysFanGio was going to say Jason Bartlett but he wasn't a choice either!

846520337856692225 2017-03-27 00:32:30 UTC <luapski56> @nytimes he came in through the bathroom window.
846494372166291457 2017-03-27 22:49:20 UTC <luapski56> @PressSec @CBSNews he probably jumped the fence like everyone else.
845749238948614145 2017-03-25 21:28:26 UTC <luapski56> @VP @FoxNews I thought we were waiting for the explosion, or the implosion, or whatever. Broken record. #notwinning
845398976325148672 2017-03-24 22:16:37 UTC <luapski56> This is how it should have gone if Trump was looking for the Democratic support that he is blaming for AHCA failure.https://twitter.com/DomenicoNPR/status/845397926453153794
845396677452337152 2017-03-24 22:07:29 UTC <luapski56> @Reuters it will be a beautiful pipeline. It will be the biggest pipeline ever, and it will be much better than our Health Care bill.
845395098871484416 2017-03-24 22:01:12 UTC <luapski56> @ericbolling @FoxNews what happened, did O'Reilly call in sick after Health Care melt-down today? #notwinning
845394740417847296 2017-03-24 21:59:47 UTC <luapski56> @CBSNews it's never-ending. He can't get control of his own party and yet thinks there is help coming from across the aisle? #notwinning
845391833463226369 2017-03-24 21:48:14 UTC <luapski56> @kimguilfoyle @FoxNews well duh. Talk about Monday morning quarterbacking. Not rocket science here folks. #notwinning
845389013729103874 2017-03-24 21:37:02 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @kimguilfoyle @FoxNews heck yeah. Already bungled Health Care, let's move on to bigger and better things. #notwinning
845376409690361857 2017-03-24 20:46:57 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @FoxNews can't get own party under control, why think you would get help from across the aisle? #notwinning
845371447723917313 2017-03-24 20:27:14 UTC <luapski56> @jmartNYT @katiecouric but Trump blaming Dems for this failure. Sad!
845360200378994688 2017-03-24 19:42:32 UTC <luapski56> @USATODAYcollege @USATODAY well that adds a whole new dimension to playing an away game there. Time for rest of SEC to even things up!
845108006421499905 2017-03-23 03:00:24 UTC <luapski56> @SpeakerRyan @POTUS @michellemalkin @FoxNews Eight years of whining and complaining about Obamacare and this is where we stand? Sad!
845105930161344513 2017-03-23 02:52:09 UTC <luapski56> @seanhannity @FoxNews now let's not blame it all on Congress...Trump has done plenty of damage to himself along the way here.
845071533789851649 2017-03-23 00:35:28 UTC <luapski56> @Rep_Hunter @FoxNews well heck, if it will "Save America" then we better get right on that. Puhleeeeze. Spare the rhetoric.
844654217444966401 2017-03-22 20:57:13 UTC <luapski56> @bigpaulyb I am going to go out on a limb here and say that the American people are never going to know what in the eff has happened!
844357829108649984 2017-03-21 01:19:28 UTC <luapski56> @oreillyfactor @FoxNews what if it is both??
844357611478757376 2017-03-21 01:18:36 UTC <luapski56> @oreillyfactor @FoxNews wonder how Merrick Garland would have fared in a hearing such as this? Thanks to GOP we'll never know.
844356991711678464 2017-03-21 01:16:08 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews when the going gets tough the tough go to Russia. Or call, or text, or Tweet...whatever gets the job done.
844229872687988736 2017-03-21 16:51:01 UTC <luapski56> @Cliff_Wolf when you shop in the bargain basement you know that you're going to get a clunker now and then. New mgmt team maybe not as savvy
844228162183712768 2017-03-21 16:44:13 UTC <luapski56> @Cliff_Wolf it's what happens when you buy "as is" merchandise. It usually comes with a qualifier like "no refunds" and "no exchanges!"
843252307143921666 2017-03-18 00:06:31 UTC <luapski56> @KevinPhilpot do it. We won't tell!
842527444833914880 2017-03-16 00:06:10 UTC <luapski56> @LisaMarieBoothe @FoxNews boy, it's been a bad day when you have to bring out negatives against the First Lady to feel good.
842525220825190400 2017-03-16 23:57:20 UTC <luapski56> @RickSantorum @CNN it's called misdirection and is a common tactic for those trying to move suspicion away from themselves.
842208549187002368 2017-03-15 02:59:00 UTC <luapski56> @CBSNews this is good news. Let's hope they find and prosecute the rest of these people making threats against the Jewish community centers.
842207318561456128 2017-03-15 02:54:06 UTC <luapski56> @CNN somehow I just see this guy as a used car salesman and not much more.
842206832550678528 2017-03-15 02:52:10 UTC <luapski56> @maddow @JaySekulow @FoxNews kinda like claiming you have been "wire tapped" with zero proof to back it up, right?
842183773496188928 2017-03-15 01:20:33 UTC <luapski56> @POTUS @FoxNews can we get that in writing? Doubt it, or it will have air quotes around it.
842183110271860737 2017-03-15 01:17:55 UTC <luapski56> @GOP @TheDemocrats @POTUS @FoxNews how does that feel? Eight years no help from GOP on anything comes back around.
841838696752156673 2017-03-14 02:29:20 UTC <luapski56> @JaySekulow @FoxNews probably came from the secret microwave camera files.
841479525372424192 2017-03-13 02:42:07 UTC <luapski56> @GOP @POTUS @seanhannity @FoxNews well, he hasn't done himself any favors either.
841450846399401984 2017-03-13 00:48:09 UTC <luapski56> I object, I strenuously object! "Oh well, if you strenuously object I should take some time to reconsider!" A Few Good Men! Seriously?https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/841396607165722625
841449057885257730 2017-03-13 00:41:03 UTC <luapski56> Well that seems about right. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer and sicker. What's the issue? I've got mine, get your own. Sad!https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/841382678570004480
841327412931620867 2017-03-13 16:37:41 UTC <luapski56> @CBSNews the Democrats will say it understates the problem, the Republicans will say it overstates the problem and life will go on BAU.
841276527249625088 2017-03-13 13:15:28 UTC <luapski56> @CNN does he mean we would all be angry old white guys? Well, that's not very appealing!
841112659474931713 2017-03-12 02:24:19 UTC <luapski56> Uh oh, a whole day without a Tweet? Somebody hid his phone I'm guessing. I bet tomorrow will be a Tweetfest of the highest magnitude!https://twitter.com/kellyo/status/841093425290235905

840012582144626688 2017-03-09 01:33:00 UTC <luapski56> @CNN ok folks, raise your hand if you ever actually thought Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Hope your hand isn't still up!!
839618711170473985 2017-03-08 23:27:54 UTC <luapski56> Seriously, think about how much her company would have to have paid for this kind of publicity. She should give Kellyanne a cut now.https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/839617996842754049

839615227863891969 2017-03-08 23:14:04 UTC <luapski56> @RaysFanGio think that is a WOWZER. Not to be confused with the German Mauser from WWII. Wanted one but wife said recoil would kill me!
839291940617207814 2017-03-07 01:49:26 UTC <luapski56> @SenTomCotton @FoxNews Let's be honest, the Russians, Chinese, and every other power has the capability to do what is revealed here.

834121410259906564 2017-02-21 19:23:36 UTC <luapski56> @AP_Oddities was he carrying a sign that said "Eat Mor Chickn?"
832767612585127936 2017-02-17 01:44:05 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews first he should probably figure out how to pay for the wall with Mexico.
832417715503628291 2017-02-16 02:33:43 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews they did that here in Florida and their number one answer was....Death Panels! It can only get better!
832303680154169344 2017-02-16 19:00:35 UTC <luapski56> @bigpaulyb unlike fine wine, I don't think it will age well!
832303128292765696 2017-02-16 18:58:23 UTC <luapski56> Ok, we get it. The mainstream media is bad. Flynn is a good guy. And wait for it....I am not a crook.https://twitter.com/ap/status/832297661655048193
831960783823241226 2017-02-15 20:18:02 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews and the other 43% are a big reason we have the stress because they don't bother to go to the polls.
831935049880727552 2017-02-15 18:35:47 UTC <luapski56> @bigpaulyb seriously, they are getting as much free exposure out of this as Fox. As long as Trump keeps tweeting about CNN they'll let it go
831868336174723072 2017-02-15 14:10:41 UTC <luapski56> Oh dang. Now I have to take the car in for a recall because it might catch fire. First my Samsung phone, now this with the Lambo. Bummed https://twitter.com/cnn/status/831854074693877761
831643038657155073 2017-02-14 23:15:26 UTC <luapski56> Not good. Now Odorizzi makes $4.1M instead of $3.8M thus taking him out of #Rays salary range. Predict he'll be gone at All-Star break!https://twitter.com/rays_fanly/status/831630541229277184
831614637275742212 2017-02-14 21:22:34 UTC <luapski56> It's not that he did anything wrong, it's that someone let the cat out of the bag?! Think the problem is a little deeper than Mr. Flynn.https://twitter.com/cnnmoney/status/831610219755139074

831278723370463234 2017-02-13 23:07:46 UTC <luapski56> "Evaluating the situation" is code-speak for getting ready to "throw him under the bus." Then again, maybe a little "counseling" ala KAC.https://twitter.com/usatoday/status/831277390235971584
831272911134740481 2017-02-13 22:44:40 UTC <luapski56> Uh oh....time for another wall. This one will be a wee bit longer than the one with Mexico but if Canada pays, what heck.https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/831257920738320386

830840760002035712 2017-02-12 18:07:28 UTC <luapski56> a couple weeks of Trump will do that to a person! Here's hoping it gets better soon

830465555043909635 2017-02-11 17:16:32 UTC <luapski56> I told my wife about this and she immediately said "fake news!"https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/830461907459047425
830249179817635840 2017-02-10 02:56:44 UTC <luapski56> Sam Fuld was such an inspirational player. Would love to see him back in a #Rays uniform, even as a coach or in a support role.https://twitter.com/rays_fanly/status/830056471324917760
830135735026081792 2017-02-10 19:25:57 UTC <luapski56> @KevinPhilpot hey, all that snark has to have some place to go. Besides, you can go after mgmt and ownership as well. Fish in a barrel 
830061606235209729 2017-02-10 14:31:23 UTC <luapski56> @KevinPhilpot another few weeks and there will be #Rays baseball! That might be good for a few Tweets.

829772178237308928 2017-02-09 19:21:18 UTC <luapski56> @AP the Crabby McNuggets can't be far behind.
829767521733582849 2017-02-09 19:02:48 UTC <luapski56> Not to worry. Congress will get rid of ethics commission and all these silly regulations that make it illegal shortly.https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/829734134255874048
829085919529594881 2017-02-07 21:54:21 UTC <luapski56> This looks excellent. Too lazy to make it, but take-out might be an option!https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/829082330576863236

828361651388821504 2017-02-05 21:56:22 UTC <luapski56> @KellyO and that is what all will be waiting for, another Bowling Green massacre.

827655587219513344 2017-02-03 23:10:43 UTC <luapski56> @NBCDFW @NBCNews brings back fond memories of growing up in the early 60's and those fallout shelter drills at school. Miss that.

827623981138243584 2017-02-03 21:05:08 UTC <luapski56> What happened to "To Big To Fail" and all that followed? The rich get richer once again and the cycle repeats itself.https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/827595515814625280
827590360809496577 2017-02-03 18:51:32 UTC <luapski56> They should sell tickets on pay-per-view like boxing or mixed martial arts matches. Bet the draw would be big.https://twitter.com/rollingstone/status/827586017117011969
827581904748736512 2017-02-03 18:17:56 UTC <luapski56> Let's hope #Rays LoMo hits his stride a little earlier this season and shores up the defense a bit.https://twitter.com/draysbay/status/827573475116150784

827327145949196288 2017-02-02 01:25:37 UTC <luapski56> If this is not "fake news", I'm going to give POTUS an "atta boy" on this decision.https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/827324196254531585
827326023784079362 2017-02-02 01:21:09 UTC <luapski56> Is this "fake news"? I hope someone will confirm that it is. Confused.https://twitter.com/usatoday/status/827300602485043200
827290492077481984 2017-02-02 22:59:58 UTC <luapski56> Wait, I thought we just lifted sanctions against them earlier today. I'm so confused. The shock and awe is getting to me.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/827283460456804357
827216544748941313 2017-02-02 18:06:07 UTC <luapski56> @NBCNews this is good to know. I'll be sleeping better tonight now that I can quit worrying.
827215686686666753 2017-02-02 18:02:43 UTC <luapski56> What is going on here? First we tick off the Aussies, now we snuggle up with Putin. I guess we've been wrong all these years. Good to know.https://twitter.com/usatoday/status/827215031586557952

826863524211220481 2017-02-01 18:43:21 UTC <luapski56> Wonder if Gorsuch is on Twitter? Seems unlikely POTUS would read more than 140 characters of anything.https://twitter.com/realrbhjr/status/826803511191072768
826861183198228480 2017-02-01 18:34:03 UTC <luapski56> OMG. Now here is a problem that demands immediate attention. Let's hope Congress isn't involved in the solution.https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/826830735952719872
826859888743763987 2017-02-01 18:28:54 UTC <luapski56> Gosh, wish he'd use a little better term than "Go Nuclear" here. It's a little unsettling!https://twitter.com/usatoday/status/826845103297671169

785650149615931392 2016-10-10 01:16:06 UTC <luapski56> Now I remember why I don't watch the #Bucs much anymore. Self-destructing on most every series of downs. Winning culture is missing here.

777322941763690496 2016-09-17 01:46:45 UTC <luapski56> Is it just me or does it feel like #Rays hitters have been having some more competitive at bats here the last few games? Just wondering!

760656227324030976 2016-08-02 01:59:11 UTC <luapski56> #Rays ouch. Lead off double wasted.
760655672686080000 2016-08-02 01:56:59 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Souza tries to bunt, then gives up an unproductive grounder to the left side of the infield. Questioning the strategy.
760639440343662592 2016-08-02 00:52:29 UTC <luapski56> #Rays manufacturing some runs here! Hey, they all count!
760294061441966080 2016-08-01 02:00:04 UTC <luapski56> Probably depends on the venue and clientele! https://twitter.com/wqykgeno/status/760292281576333313
760290568790503424 2016-08-01 01:46:11 UTC <luapski56> It seems like the #Royals have pretty much owned the  #Rays the last two or three seasons. Similar market teams, what is the difference?
760284600270778368 2016-08-01 01:22:28 UTC <luapski56> Maybe all the #Rays trade action today sucked whatever life was left out of this team. Too bad, still lots of baseball left this year.
760186197297754113 2016-08-01 18:51:27 UTC <luapski56> Well #Rays make a trade *yawnhttps://twitter.com/raysbaseball/status/760185886268989440
759193059049496576 2016-07-29 01:05:05 UTC <luapski56> This is what was missing the whole first half, quality starts and limited bull pen usage.https://twitter.com/neilsolondz/status/759192610930065408
757925933990998016 2016-07-26 13:09:58 UTC <luapski56> @RaysFanGio you misspelled Melvin!
757614344192548865 2016-07-25 16:31:50 UTC <luapski56> Wow, Joe Maddon is getting more new toys! The way the #Cubs spend money is a *little* different than the #Rays!!https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/757613496980897792
751195237842911232 2016-07-07 23:24:35 UTC <luapski56> I bet he comes on right after Clint Eastwood.....https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/751177757900636160
750853260777558016 2016-07-06 00:45:42 UTC <luapski56> Whatever the #Rays have done to tick off the Baseball gods must have been unforgivable. This is just unbelievable in so many ways. Help !!
750772537131425793 2016-07-06 19:24:56 UTC <luapski56> I just voted to send Evan Longoria to the 2016 #ASG! Help him win the Final Vote!  http://mlb.mlb.com/vote/?tcid=tw_share #

745066134932701185 2016-06-20 01:29:43 UTC <luapski56> Burned out before the All Star game. Second half doesn't bode well unless starters figure it out.https://twitter.com/tbtimes_rays/status/745065666747719681
745065427655659520 2016-06-20 01:26:55 UTC <luapski56> #Rays game over. *sigh*
745064699092402176 2016-06-20 01:24:01 UTC <luapski56> Of course the other options have not been optimal either. Starting pitching has been the biggest let down this year.https://twitter.com/danebassett/status/745064185759993856
743623894892969984 2016-06-16 01:58:47 UTC <luapski56> #LFDH favorite song of the night "Why Do Lovers Break Each Other's Hearts." Great vibe.

741422947739394049 2016-06-10 00:13:00 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Hickey is the "pitcher whisperer!" More times than not after his trips to the mound good things happen!

739972087851417605 2016-06-06 00:07:48 UTC <luapski56> every episode this season so far has been over the top! Keep it coming.
738542110987681792 2016-06-02 01:25:35 UTC <luapski56> #Rays starting pitching again under fire in the early innings. No amount of offense is going to overcome this lack of starting pitching.
738534866371936256 2016-06-02 00:56:48 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Longo comes through with two outs in the third and now LoMo puts a single up the middle for another RBI!

732748824922492928 2016-05-17 01:45:08 UTC <luapski56> Since #Rays Motter was batting for Brad Miller and hits a homer does that count for the cycle?! Well it should!
732748392292618240 2016-05-17 01:43:25 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Motter goes massive!!!
732746782292185089 2016-05-17 01:37:01 UTC <luapski56> Credit to #Rays LoMo digging that double play ball out of the dirt there.
732745381688315908 2016-05-17 01:31:27 UTC <luapski56> #Rays not really hitting Vinditte that hard. Would be more interesting if he threw the knuckleball both left and right handed!
732391398956277760 2016-05-16 02:04:51 UTC <luapski56> #Rays needed a game like that for a change. Guess JoeyBats still feeling that right cross after the slide into second at Texas!!
732354625513357313 2016-05-16 23:38:43 UTC <luapski56> Totally agree, but that was the HBP. The hard right to the jaw after the slide into second was icing on the cake!https://twitter.com/bigpaulyb/status/732350200115826688
731944979103383552 2016-05-15 20:30:56 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Stu Sternberg was right at the beginning of the season, we could win 72 games this year. I'll omit the high end where he said 97!!
731645053442101248 2016-05-14 00:39:08 UTC <luapski56> #Rays getting some hits tonight with RISP....now that is nice. Matt Andriese having a great start, let's get the W now! #RaysUp
731289542792187904 2016-05-13 01:06:28 UTC <luapski56> #Rays 2016 lack of offense is BAU, but the sudden failure of starting pitching is concerning. Long season if this keeps up.
729446389579681798 2016-05-08 23:02:26 UTC <luapski56> Did anyone else notice the Tuesday pitching matchup with #Rays Smyly going against #Mariners Miley? Ok, just struck me funny!! Carry on.
729439568768970755 2016-05-08 22:35:20 UTC <luapski56> #Rays get the series sweep over the Angels 3-1!
729431787743678464 2016-05-08 22:04:25 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Souza Jr. Getting some clever camera time there by tying his colorful shoes!
729425053088092161 2016-05-08 21:37:39 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Matt Andriese with a gutsy pitching performance to strike out Trout and get Pujols to hit into the double play. Nicely done.
729317832593387520 2016-05-08 14:31:36 UTC <luapski56> Interesting stat. Wonder what the top 5 teams are in men left on base in scoring position?https://twitter.com/scrumryanradio/status/729311921699196928
728049572543520768 2016-05-04 02:31:59 UTC <luapski56> #Rays fans thank you Mr. Colome for saving our sanity in this crazy game tonight! Many happy returns. #RaysUp

728044215209476096 2016-05-04 02:10:41 UTC <luapski56> OMG #Rays that was too painful. Please, can we get through one more inning unscathed and call it a day? Thanks in advance.
728041463326625793 2016-05-04 01:59:45 UTC <luapski56> Dear Brad Boxberger, please get well soon. Thanks, #Rays baseball.
728040336229052416 2016-05-04 01:55:17 UTC <luapski56> Seriously #Rays after a great offensive inning now looking to hand it back in the 8th? C'mon, let's get some outs here!
728036501880229888 2016-05-04 01:40:02 UTC <luapski56> Dodgers Baez trying his best to give the #Rays a few more runs here.
727896762896265216 2016-05-04 16:24:46 UTC <luapski56> What? This can't be right. I mean he never even named his running mate ala Ted Cruz. I was looking forward to that!https://twitter.com/newshour/status/727895688307216385
726856869671784449 2016-05-01 19:32:36 UTC <luapski56> Hope #Rays Boxberger gets well soon. Or else we need to find significantly more offense to go toe to toe with these guys!
726856253041946624 2016-05-01 19:30:09 UTC <luapski56> #Rays SIGH.
726854858347782147 2016-05-01 19:24:37 UTC <luapski56> Uh oh #Rays, this doesn't look good with Joey Bats coming to the plate. Keep it in the yard!
726847199435444224 2016-05-01 18:54:11 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Odorizzi with some masterful pitching to get out of the 7th unscathed! Time to score some runs!#Raysup
726577773188386816 2016-04-30 01:03:34 UTC <luapski56> Now that was a quality #Rays win in the ninth. Rays win!!
726576660091396100 2016-04-30 00:59:09 UTC <luapski56> C'mon now #Rays, a sac fly and we win here!!
726221166696878081 2016-04-29 01:26:33 UTC <luapski56> Thank you Brad Miller for saving the #Rays from a weak looking shut-out.
726220541540048896 2016-04-29 01:24:04 UTC <luapski56> #Rays ouch. Blue Jays making us pay now for every free pass and cheap hit.
726210045059420160 2016-04-29 00:42:21 UTC <luapski56> Pretty much says it all. The offense with RISP is non-existent. Same MO as pretty much the last several years.https://twitter.com/cliff_wolf/status/726208233011027968
725846956774440960 2016-04-28 00:39:34 UTC <luapski56> So seriously, where are the Bucs on this list? Can't be too much further up the food chain!https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/725846563138969600
725785685865684993 2016-04-28 20:36:06 UTC <luapski56> Do they even have a Presidential Suite??https://twitter.com/cnn/status/725773329190248449
725423579119104000 2016-04-27 20:37:13 UTC <luapski56> I bet Donald Trump is heartbroken over this! Now I'm kinda looking forward to John Kasich's choice!https://twitter.com/newshour/status/725420164586606593
725128694881112064 2016-04-26 01:05:27 UTC <luapski56> I'm going to give #Rays Logan Morrison credit, he is getting some wood on the ball without much to show for it. I'm still undecided here!
725127150693654529 2016-04-26 00:59:19 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Enny Romero with a Meredith inning there. Total dominance.
725125334476197888 2016-04-26 00:52:06 UTC <luapski56> #rays Corey Dickerson does not get cheated on swings at the plate. Hacking big time!
725123267242147842 2016-04-26 00:43:53 UTC <luapski56> #rays and #orioles game seems a little slow and sloppy so far tonight. Both teams looking for a spark.
725119698619236354 2016-04-26 00:29:42 UTC <luapski56> Woo Hoo #rays get the twin killing! Awesome!
725119268275236864 2016-04-26 00:28:00 UTC <luapski56> Uh oh. The wheels are coming off the #rays wagon now. Odorizzi struggling with command here in the 4th.
725117046875377664 2016-04-26 00:19:10 UTC <luapski56> Oh No LoMo goes down swinging again and #rays get just the 1 run. Sigh...
725115334710185984 2016-04-26 00:12:22 UTC <luapski56> Stu Sternberg says #rays Longoria should take a couple pitches! Like that observation!
724777234603597824 2016-04-25 01:48:53 UTC <luapski56> Great game for the #rays tonight. Team win, but Archer finally looks like Archer and that's huge!
724405521026027521 2016-04-24 01:11:49 UTC <luapski56> So just wondering, is your Mom going to like this Tweet??!https://twitter.com/raysfangio/status/724403905946218498
722971574169665536 2016-04-20 02:13:50 UTC <luapski56> Well that was a bit of a let-down by the #Rays after the great win yesterday. Still looking for some consistency here. Tomorrow boys!
722962938567516160 2016-04-20 01:39:31 UTC <luapski56> #Rays KK doing his Outlaw thing! What a grab on that drive over his head!
722955290778435584 2016-04-20 01:09:07 UTC <luapski56> Not sure about back in it, but at least the #Rays won't get shut out and that's always a good thing!https://twitter.com/nomadicraysfan/status/722954920996016128
722615540452311041 2016-04-19 02:39:05 UTC <luapski56> Quality win tonight for the #Rays. That has to be a confidence boost, although the offense still needs work, the pitching was vintage!
722613845093720065 2016-04-19 02:32:20 UTC <luapski56> Think it was his own mother. You know how those Boston fans are!https://twitter.com/scotttravissn/status/722613210965258240
722611830577881090 2016-04-19 02:24:20 UTC <luapski56> Woo Hoo  #Rays Jennings comes through! Keep it going boys!
722610099227901952 2016-04-19 02:17:27 UTC <luapski56> I'm almost starting to feel bad for  #Rays Morrison now. Even if you multiplied his current average by 4 he'd barely make the Mendoza line!
722602122643116032 2016-04-19 01:45:45 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Smyly what a gutsy performance for 8 innings. Seriously, what a shame to waste that effort. Let's get some runs!
722599699157491712 2016-04-19 01:36:08 UTC <luapski56> How much longer do the #Rays stick with Morrison before moving on? The Pat Burrell experiment all over?
722592193114988544 2016-04-19 01:06:18 UTC <luapski56> My Kingdom for some #Rays offense! Where for art thou missing bats?
721505573552984067 2016-04-16 01:08:28 UTC <luapski56> @NomadicRaysFan @RaysBaseball so are we going to 5 man rotation or removing one of the current 4 in the rotation??
721504026148409344 2016-04-16 01:02:19 UTC <luapski56> #RaysUp great performance all around tonight. Erasmo's start was a much needed outing for the #Rays and the offense responded with a spark!
721502334396850176 2016-04-16 00:55:36 UTC <luapski56> As much as #Rays Brandon Guyer gets hit by pitches you wonder if he has Kevlar on under his uni. That has to hurt no matter what otherwise!
721497611824414720 2016-04-16 00:36:50 UTC <luapski56> #Rays put up some run support for the Staff tonight! That's a welcome sight.
721495108013703168 2016-04-16 00:26:53 UTC <luapski56> Hey, if they can do it in Cuba we have to allow it at the Trop!https://twitter.com/pcales/status/721493826326532096
721488701432426496 2016-04-16 00:01:25 UTC <luapski56> #Rays missing McGee and Boxberger here now in these late inning situations.
721137206442749952 2016-04-15 00:44:42 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Odorizzi pitching his @$$ off tonight. Where is the new-fangled offense??
720065137034571776 2016-04-12 01:44:41 UTC <luapski56> Most complete game so far this year for the #Rays IMHO! Victory!
720063860200316928 2016-04-12 01:39:37 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Colome with the Fernando Rodney hat tilt thing going on, but sorry, not quite the same swagger!
720060797767061504 2016-04-12 01:27:26 UTC <luapski56> Woo Hoo LoFo goes long for #Rays ! 2 run bomb!!
720056998469967873 2016-04-12 01:12:21 UTC <luapski56> Paging Mr. Loney, Mr. James Loney, please return to the Trop and bring your bat with you. Thank you, #Rays management!
720052741826035716 2016-04-12 00:55:26 UTC <luapski56> For those who said the #Rays biggest problem was starting pitching vs. lack of offense so far I'm asking you to reconsider!!
720040842296225792 2016-04-12 00:08:09 UTC <luapski56> @watchingtherays I'd be ok if he walked up to "Baby I'm A Want You" by Bread if it would get him a hit!
718966775250083840 2016-04-09 01:00:11 UTC <luapski56> @watchingtherays Ummm....Haagen-Dazs vanilla Swiss Almond??? Just a thought!
718600930535555072 2016-04-08 00:46:27 UTC <luapski56> #Rays Archer getting rocked by the O's now. Time to see our new offense come to life now!
717543746624208896 2016-04-05 02:45:35 UTC <luapski56> #Rays don't know how to feel about the win tonight. Old school says Bautista was just playing the game. Need to see more of this in season.
717171905653055489 2016-04-04 02:08:01 UTC <luapski56> So the story of this game for the #Rays is pretty much the same as always. Too many men left on base, especially in less than 2 out spots.
716752411633778692 2016-04-03 22:21:06 UTC <luapski56> Check with Stu Sternberg. He might let you use his Kegerator, or whatever it was he was tapping into in his suite!https://twitter.com/recjus85/status/716751728838893568
716748936514502656 2016-04-03 22:07:17 UTC <luapski56> I bet Loney has a better fielding percentage! Well, maybe not, but close.https://twitter.com/raysfangio/status/716748234119581696

716737860825645057 2016-04-03 21:23:17 UTC <luapski56> How big does LoMo's miscue look now? No free outs.  #Rays
716736310887784448 2016-04-03 21:17:07 UTC <luapski56> #Rays you know who would have made that play just now at first on the line drive??? James Loney! Oh well.
716735790710185985 2016-04-03 21:15:03 UTC <luapski56> #Rays you know who I wanted to see hitting right there with 2 on and 2 out??? James Loney!! Oh well.
716726443053547520 2016-04-03 20:37:54 UTC <luapski56> Should we start the Loney release discussion now? #Rayshttps://twitter.com/tbtimes_rays/status/716726065729814528
716722169829593088 2016-04-03 20:20:55 UTC <luapski56> #Rays may be testing the bullpen here early in the season!

705579383331950593 2016-03-03 02:23:28 UTC <luapski56> #GOPDebate just points out that honestly there has to be room for more than 2 political parties in this country. What is stopping that??

703380950726610944 2016-02-26 00:47:41 UTC <luapski56> @RaysFanGio so I wanted to hit like, but in the end all I could think was "pile of dog mess under Spanish moss in the back yard!" Tasty 
703065325449977856 2016-02-25 03:53:30 UTC <luapski56> #GOPDebate the final one. Thank you very much!

700859810611388417 2016-02-19 01:49:34 UTC <luapski56> Somehow this seems to play into Trump's claims of weakness on Jeb's part. Now his  mom and brother have to help him.https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/700843585856532480
698710912526581760 2016-02-13 03:30:37 UTC <luapski56> #GOPDebate so much to be proud of here tonight. And one of these people is supposed to make America great again? Oh my.
