933155729136959488 2017-11-21 02:10:37 UTC <garlicwhisper> Then a man walks in to the womens restroom (yes he seemed to present himself as a cis man) snorts, coughs, says OH MY GOD, throws his jacket on the floor, goes in a stall & starts moaning 
933155369441943552 2017-11-21 02:09:11 UTC <garlicwhisper> I went to the bookstore bathroom & the counter was covered in blood. BLOOD.

929276694124302337 2017-11-11 09:16:43 UTC <garlicwhisper> I read this in the voiceshttps://twitter.com/marisayasminn/status/928407729198088192
929274701561544704 2017-11-11 09:08:48 UTC <garlicwhisper> Long rant, but its just something that really saddens me to watch.
929274590676713479 2017-11-11 09:08:22 UTC <garlicwhisper> When my dad gets students in this situation, he usually tries to send them to university in Nor Cal so they can start fresh
929274221817053184 2017-11-11 09:06:54 UTC <garlicwhisper> And its usually these same parents that wont help their kids get started in the real world yet chain them down at home with debt
929273823282655232 2017-11-11 09:05:19 UTC <garlicwhisper> Im not saying you have to spoil your kids either but to charge a 18-21 y/o for rent in the family home or FOOD is fucked up
929273489277587456 2017-11-11 09:03:59 UTC <garlicwhisper> No one asked to be born, especially not into debt
929273291050594305 2017-11-11 09:03:12 UTC <garlicwhisper> Unless you need all hands on deck to survive, you shouldnt charge your children to be raised
929273082853732352 2017-11-11 09:02:22 UTC <garlicwhisper> Another reason I dont want kids: because Im aware of the sacrifices that are supposed to take place in raising children
929272902674874369 2017-11-11 09:01:39 UTC <garlicwhisper> I get so sad when my friends say they owe their parents money. Parenting should be about sacrificing  superficial things for your child.

765469655796289536 2016-08-16 08:46:02 UTC <garlicwhisper> To say atheists just "haven't found Jesus yet" is invalidating, rude, & implies that Christians are the highest beings.

742174942779740160 2016-06-12 02:01:09 UTC <garlicwhisper> The whole pro-gun argument is non sequitur to the issues we're facing & the points we bring forth
742174584921673728 2016-06-12 01:59:44 UTC <garlicwhisper> It's no coincidence that we're the only major western civilization with such common massacres... We're the only one with permissive gun laws
742174203261001730 2016-06-12 01:58:13 UTC <garlicwhisper> That's like saying "heroin doesn't inject itself, people do" ergo people misuse things so they become illegal to possess
742173687890092033 2016-06-12 01:56:10 UTC <garlicwhisper> The argument "guns don't kill, people do" is so strange bc it's true but the point of gun laws are to restrict them FROM people so...
