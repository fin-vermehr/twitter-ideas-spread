971475664284143619 2018-03-07 20:00:22 UTC <MariaHaskins> @writerjencrow I know a couple of families where they are just still "fixing" things and it makes me so sad. :(
971472504433795072 2018-03-07 19:47:48 UTC <MariaHaskins> @writerjencrow THIS!!! OMG, I remember the moment when I realized this for my son. Sitting in a speech therapy session that was boring him to tears and making me feel helpless. He IS NOT BROKEN. He's different, but he is OK, and he is himself.
971471210063192064 2018-03-07 19:42:40 UTC <MariaHaskins> There is no one-size-fits-all parenting, and IMO, all good parenting is a give and take between child and parent. There is no formula, no manual. You make it up as you go along and you pay attention to your kids and what works.
971471209262039041 2018-03-07 19:42:40 UTC <MariaHaskins> What I finally realized was that I didn't really give a crap about what other people assumed about him or me as a parent. He needs to do things in a certain way and maybe me allowing that looks like "coddling" to some, but I know that's bullshit.
971471208364457984 2018-03-07 19:42:39 UTC <MariaHaskins> So much of parental stress doesn't come from raising your kids, but what other people think of how you raise your kids, or what your kids do. My son has various special needs that affect him in a multitude of ways & when he was very young, I felt I was always doing things wrong.
971471207529721856 2018-03-07 19:42:39 UTC <MariaHaskins> Kids are people. Even when they're born, they are unique individuals, not blank slates to be shaped by a parent. IMO, you don't shape your child as much as you get to know them. Some things work for some kids, other things work for other kids. What works can change. It's fluid.
971471206695120896 2018-03-07 19:42:39 UTC <MariaHaskins> Lots of parenting thoughts for me lately. About how I hate all that authoritarian bullshit that so many people seem to believe in for their kids. I wasn't brought up that way (and I'm an old lady, remember, so to me, authoritarian does NOT equal "the good old days").

971124473444294656 2018-03-06 20:44:51 UTC <MariaHaskins> @CicadaMagazine I started reading Cicada more regularly the last few months and I know sometimes people get hung up on the "kids & YA" thing, but Cicada is publishing some amazing fiction: bold, beautiful & unique.  Well worth a subscription imo, even if you're an Old Lady like me... ;)

971103960944623617 2018-03-06 19:23:21 UTC <MariaHaskins> That line is just so much funnier in the northern Swedish dialect than in translation and than it is in regular Swedish. I can't even begin to explain why. Language, man.... languages are awesome.
971103960017682432 2018-03-06 19:23:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> Some jokes are funnier in dialect. Once, in the ladies' room at a "disco" in Skellefte, a woman (she was maybe an ancient 30 and my friends and I were barely 20) told us (while we were primping) "Nog dug ni t det som finns dr ute" AKA "You're good enough for what's out there".
971103959065575424 2018-03-06 19:23:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> It is also REALLY HARD to translate regional dialects. I can translate between Swedish and English, but I can't even fathom how I'd translate bondska into English and retain the feeling for what it sounds like...
971103958188965888 2018-03-06 19:23:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> This is a man speaking bondska, and I almost tear up listening to this because it reminds me of my grandparents so much:https://youtu.be/ooCLe66ewEk
971103957341761536 2018-03-06 19:23:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> So, growing up, I knew immediately when my dad was talking to his siblings or my grandparents on the phone, because he'd immediately switch from regular Swedish to bondska. I still love hearing it, and now I mainly hear it when my dad is talking to his brothers and sisters.
971103956456718336 2018-03-06 19:23:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> My paternal grandparents spoke only bondska. So did my dad and his siblings, but when they moved away / studied they switched to "regular Swedish" (with the "regular" regional dialect), but still speak bondska with each other.
971103955529826304 2018-03-06 19:23:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> Random Tuesday thoughts: languages are fascinating and so are regional dialects. I grew up in northern Sweden which has a specific dialect & also an older dialect that is VERY hard for people to understand if they didn't grow up hearing it ("bondska": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westrobothnian)
971100201959092224 2018-03-06 19:08:24 UTC <MariaHaskins> @suchwanderings It is fascinating. When I'm in Sweden, we often switch between because my SO and kids are more comfortable in English, and sometimes a bunch of all Swedish people end up sitting there talking English to each other because all native English speakers left. LOL.

970161470418796544 2018-03-03 04:58:13 UTC <MariaHaskins> @JustinHowe It should come with a warning: "this is not the goofy dance movie you're looking for".
970159618927222786 2018-03-03 04:50:52 UTC <MariaHaskins> @JustinHowe YES. It is like harsh social realism in a working class setting. But with disco and the Bee Gees.
970159332439482369 2018-03-03 04:49:44 UTC <MariaHaskins> @paulalexgray Oh yeah. The back story is a drama in itself.
970158807933272064 2018-03-03 04:47:39 UTC <MariaHaskins> And not to reveal any spoilers, but the Bobby C on the bridge (with Annette and everyone else) scene?   Just crush me, OK?
970158262405312512 2018-03-03 04:45:29 UTC <MariaHaskins> @unrealfred But it is GRADE A cheesy disco.

963883727918047232 2018-02-14 21:12:43 UTC <MariaHaskins> "Bear Language" in @FiresideFiction was one of my favourite stories last year. I think about that story a lot - moving, darkly funny, immensely powerful.https://twitter.com/McFlyCahill90/status/960908546350239744

963881126170312704 2018-02-14 21:02:23 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ECthetwit NO.  Can I also just say again that your line to me in edits for "Hare's Breath" - "I really want to see the hare here" - was brilliant. I think about it all the time when I write now. In my brain, it's my shorthand for "I really need to see the heart of the story here again".

963846801211080704 2018-02-14 18:45:59 UTC <MariaHaskins> I still remember the first time I read The Waste Land in high school & just sitting there, staring at it, and my whole mind just opening up to the idea that you could do THIS with language, with poetry.
963846000082264064 2018-02-14 18:42:48 UTC <MariaHaskins> "Because these wings are no longer wings to fly But merely vans to beat the air The air which is now thoroughly small and dry Smaller and dryer than the will Teach us to care and not to care Teach us to sit still."  "Ash Wednesday" - by T.S. Eliot
963845703331033088 2018-02-14 18:41:37 UTC <MariaHaskins> "At the first turning of the second stair I turned and saw below The same shape twisted on the banister Under the vapour in the fetid air Struggling with the devil of the stairs who wears The deceitul face of hope and of despair."  (I love Eliot's poetry.)

962927643430600704 2018-02-11 05:53:35 UTC <MariaHaskins> Well, one of my story-chickens came home to roost tonight.  Very sad to see @PerVisions close. They published some terrific stories.
962891741828272128 2018-02-11 03:30:55 UTC <MariaHaskins> @OJCade Yeah. :( It could have been so darn good, but somewhere along the line it just went completely off the rails.
962891063831576577 2018-02-11 03:28:13 UTC <MariaHaskins> Recurring thoughts while watching The Hobbit movies: "Don't show the rock eating worms they're just a bad dream that didn't actually happen please please please..."  "NOT F**ING ALFRED AGAIN!"

962889842928447488 2018-02-11 03:23:22 UTC <MariaHaskins> @OJCade I have no beef with any of the actors, they were pretty much excellent across the board. It's the story that let us down. :(

962437610424561664 2018-02-10 21:26:22 UTC <MariaHaskins> This is why I get choosy about who I talk to and how I talk to them...even when I think they know my family they might actually be 1000% clueless.  "Is he still like that?" WTF? Still? He IS "like that". Waiting for the day when a child will be someone else is not helpful.
962437609522778112 2018-02-10 21:26:21 UTC <MariaHaskins> TFW your child has some special needs and you share their progress and triumphs and strengths with someone and that someone looks at you blankly, and starts telling you about some vitamin therapy BS that "fixed all the problems" a friend of a friend's child were having.

961694747168526337 2018-02-08 20:14:29 UTC <MariaHaskins> As a teenager, in the mid-1980s, I picked up Alan Garner's 'Red Shift'....'Red Shift', with its passionately bickering adolescent lovers and its vertiginous plunges through the wormhole of time, shook me to the core every time I read it, and still does.  https://buff.ly/2EQ5Fmrpic.twitter.com/SDCa0KmDP4

961672977778487296 2018-02-08 18:47:59 UTC <MariaHaskins> @SurrealMarkAki A lot of it is of course imaginary & invented, but Lindgren is EVERYWHERE in Sweden. It's also interesting that her personal history (child out of wedlock, her first child in fostercare for many years etc) was a lot more complicated than people might think for a "fairytale lady".
961672364583890944 2018-02-08 18:45:33 UTC <MariaHaskins> @SurrealMarkAki I don't think there is any one easy answer to that, but Lindgren's books is something a lot of Swedes see as a major part of their cultural heritage. Small town life, magical forest creatures moving through the real world, old farming society, working class people...

961617253631328256 2018-02-08 15:06:33 UTC <MariaHaskins> Reason #345678 to get a dog: you can send it to your child's room in the morning so YOU don't have to wake them up. (Believe me, the kids will appreciate any wake-up call from a dog more than one from a parent.)
961614528885620736 2018-02-08 14:55:44 UTC <MariaHaskins> @clarkesworld @jasonsanford She is amazing. She makes even the quiet moments riveting somehow. And there's a sense of humour even in her serious stories that I love. (In this story, there are many such moments even when you feel that itching sense of dread growing.)
961614002974425088 2018-02-08 14:53:38 UTC <MariaHaskins> @photovotary I know, eh? I definitely do not know you, and you definitely do not know me... LOL.

961455592270254080 2018-02-07 04:24:10 UTC <MariaHaskins> @clarkesworld @jasonsanford OMG, this is so good. I loved her "Touring With the Alien" from 2016 - a totally different kind of story, but just as impossible to put down.
961445779247214592 2018-02-07 03:45:11 UTC <MariaHaskins> @AngelaSlatter I find it helps organize my thoughts a bit and even find what might be missing. Like, I can't go straight to that, I need to have this bit first. And like you say, it's not a strict thing...just helps keep me thinking "in the right direction".
961437583535259648 2018-02-07 03:12:37 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ECthetwit I did a rough translation into English at one time. Been thinking that maybe I should work on that some time...

961436655713308672 2018-02-07 03:08:56 UTC <MariaHaskins> Moral of this story? I don't know. Sometimes you go away for a long time and you still find your way back?  (Btw, I wanted the title "Gold Mariachi" for the book, but my editor thought "Tequila" was better and I finally acquiesced. In retrospect he was right.)
961436215055499265 2018-02-07 03:07:10 UTC <MariaHaskins> It got mixed reviews: some good, some middling, some meh. Didn't really make a big dent in anything. I especially remember one reviewer saying they liked the way I wrote dialogue. That stuck with me because it's something I tried hard to do well. (Still do.)
961435477889855489 2018-02-07 03:04:15 UTC <MariaHaskins> It came out 18 years ago this year.  Holy freaking cow.
961434956089114625 2018-02-07 03:02:10 UTC <MariaHaskins> It's in Swedish, and it was the last thing I wrote that was published in Sweden by Norstedts.
961434616514019328 2018-02-07 03:00:49 UTC <MariaHaskins> Sometimes I almost forget I actually wrote a novel once. Set in London, Dublin and Portugal. Bartending, lust, love, drinks, music...

961428285027639302 2018-02-07 02:35:40 UTC <MariaHaskins> @AlteredInstinct Yes, that's sort of how I work a lot of the time, but recently... I guess I've been working in a more structured way? And it didn't even strike me until today that I'm pretty much outlining.
961427686215188480 2018-02-07 02:33:17 UTC <MariaHaskins> I'm a total pantser. Or so I thought. Recently, I've been writing "descriptive headings" for the different sections of some of my short stories while I work on them, just to see the structure of the story more easily. And, well... that's pretty much...outlining.pic.twitter.com/5l5ly3Tz2P
961416990572265472 2018-02-07 01:50:47 UTC <MariaHaskins> @PublishersWkly OK, so now I'm almost in tears thinking about Le Guin, Cooper and Garner (three of my favourite writers) being friends irl.

961402962621874176 2018-02-07 00:55:02 UTC <MariaHaskins> @mythicdelirium @FoggWriter @jhameia I loved how that sense of unease grows and grows through the story, and how the kids all KNOW something is wrong while the adults find other explanations. So good.

960309501738942464 2018-02-04 00:30:01 UTC <MariaHaskins> @MadelineAshby @karohemd And hey, you could even bring bottles of water on board (bought BEFORE security) without anyone batting an eye! ;)
960309264274239488 2018-02-04 00:29:04 UTC <MariaHaskins> @MadelineAshby @karohemd Yep. But even on international flights you could give your ticket to someone else, as long as you checked in with them, because no one checked your ID after you had checked your luggage. I saw / did that several times in the olden days pre 9/11.

960308075977584640 2018-02-04 00:24:21 UTC <MariaHaskins> I mean, remember when there were no security checks before flights? That's not even 20 years ago.
960307709521231872 2018-02-04 00:22:54 UTC <MariaHaskins> Moral of this story: societies and seemingly rock-solid world-orders can change so quickly and fundamentally in your own lifetime that you will feel like an old coot telling loopy tales by the campfire way before you turn 70.

959817862520045568 2018-02-03 15:56:25 UTC <MariaHaskins> it has taken me 47 years to stop calling people who are mean to you in love with you. It took a long time because I think that as little girls we are conditioned to believe that cruelty and love somehow have a connection
959817614733258754 2018-02-03 15:55:26 UTC <MariaHaskins> I am one of the reasons that a young girl would walk into his room alone, the way I did... all these lambs walked into slaughter because they were convinced nobody rises to such a position who would do something illegal to you, but they do. https://buff.ly/2FHi8rApic.twitter.com/icah5Ur1G9

956549289764900865 2018-01-25 15:28:17 UTC <MariaHaskins> #ThrowbackThursday to my old blog post about one of my favourite books: FOUCAULTS PENDULUM, by Umberto Eco.  https://buff.ly/2DGnMNBpic.twitter.com/Wd0IAy40Zb
956548651869913088 2018-01-25 15:25:45 UTC <MariaHaskins> @kateheartfield Exactly. So dense and like a labyrinth to follow... Love it to bits.
956548402048724992 2018-01-25 15:24:45 UTC <MariaHaskins> even the Pendulum is a false prophet. You look at it, you think its the only fixed point in the cosmos. but...Every point of the universe is a fixed point: all you have to do is hang the Pendulum from it.
956548033822433280 2018-01-25 15:23:17 UTC <MariaHaskins> I have come to believe that the whole world is an enigma, a harmless enigma that is made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth.
956547772831776770 2018-01-25 15:22:15 UTC <MariaHaskins> "A secret is powerful when it is empty. People often mention the Masonic secret. What on earth is the Masonic secret? No one can tell. As long as it remains empty it can be filled up with every possible notion, and it has power."  Umberto Eco, Foucault's Pendulum
956546259560509440 2018-01-25 15:16:14 UTC <MariaHaskins> @Graham_Greene 
956546155755724800 2018-01-25 15:15:49 UTC <MariaHaskins> Every day of watching people distort reality with ridiculous conspiracy theories & "FAKE NEWS" makes me think that Eco's Foucault's Pendulum is the one book that really explains how dangerous it is to make yourself believe in lies.
956546154656755712 2018-01-25 15:15:49 UTC <MariaHaskins> But if there is no cosmic Plan? What a mockery, to live in exile when no one sent you there. Exile from a place, moreover, that does not exist.   Umberto Eco, Foucault's Pendulum

956308760762376192 2018-01-24 23:32:30 UTC <MariaHaskins> Feeling testy today. Variety writes about Ursula K. Le Guin's passing. Only features reactions from four male genre writers. Nothing against those writers, but really, Variety? That's the best you can do?
956295383453384704 2018-01-24 22:39:21 UTC <MariaHaskins> @BenCKinney @MauriceBroaddus @jskurella Aaaaa! MUST READ!

956284417873293312 2018-01-24 21:55:46 UTC <MariaHaskins> @Maria_Savva Definitely considering it as an option. It's been so long since I even read it... I'll let it sit for another day before I crack it open.

956271583600918530 2018-01-24 21:04:46 UTC <MariaHaskins> Oh no, my newly rejected story is novelette length... I guess when I submitted it back in 2015, that seemed like a good idea?   What to do with this long, scary baby?

956230936898621440 2018-01-24 18:23:15 UTC <MariaHaskins> @Helle_Gade, this was the story that was inspired by your Halloween drawing (bats in a tree). I'll mull over this for a bit, and then have a look at it again. I feel a bit like an archaeologist getting ready to open up an ancient box.
956230178673385473 2018-01-24 18:20:15 UTC <MariaHaskins> This morning I got a rejection that was 763 days in the making.

956193623527141376 2018-01-24 15:54:59 UTC <MariaHaskins> Plot is a marvelous device. But its not superior to story, and not even necessary to it.

956190236190523398 2018-01-24 15:41:32 UTC <MariaHaskins> @FoggWriter Exactly! She is always so anchored in real lives, real feelings, real relationships... never sentimental. All that fantasy made real.
956189919646380032 2018-01-24 15:40:16 UTC <MariaHaskins> @FoggWriter The prose is just divine in all her books. I can read it sentences out loud and just marvel at how beautiful the language is without being ornate, and how perfect the rhythm is.   Tombs of Atuan is my favourite of her books, mainly because I fell in love with it as a teen.
956187353848016896 2018-01-24 15:30:04 UTC <MariaHaskins> @premeesaurus .... I have questions.  On the other hand, I bet a knit hat like that would sell like hotcakes.
956187114055413760 2018-01-24 15:29:07 UTC <MariaHaskins> Some awesome music on this release.https://twitter.com/Graham_Greene/status/956127887760883712
956186804893315072 2018-01-24 15:27:54 UTC <MariaHaskins> @pronouncedLAHra Yeah. I me it's nice that some genre-writing is rewarded, but when the people who write amazing work and change the whole genre are not under consideration? That is so annoying.
956186436532822018 2018-01-24 15:26:26 UTC <MariaHaskins> @FoggWriter Haaa! Just replied the same to you - how I love that story! Great minds...
956186331025063937 2018-01-24 15:26:01 UTC <MariaHaskins> @FoggWriter I loved that too. And I love how honest Le Guin was about how her own thinking about that world deepened and changed over time. The Dragonfly short story, and Tehanu are both two of my favourites...
956079839253065729 2018-01-24 08:22:51 UTC <MariaHaskins> I really loved this short story collection by Le Guin (published in 2001) - Tales From Earthsea. In many ways, it gave me a new perspective on Roke and magic and Earthsea itself. https://buff.ly/2DGOSnspic.twitter.com/reXX9vQD8I
956063146418036737 2018-01-23 07:16:31 UTC <MariaHaskins> @pronouncedLAHra I wish they had, too. But I don't think they would ever give it to anyone that was so totally and completely a "fantasy & sf writer". I wonder how many of them have even read her work.
956036344572207104 2018-01-23 05:30:01 UTC <MariaHaskins> @medievalguy Such an excellent book. I read it when I was still locked in "I can't write" hell - and it helped me so much.
956035743465508864 2018-01-23 05:27:38 UTC <MariaHaskins> She should have won a Nobel for literature, imho. I know the Swedish Academy would never ever give it to her, but she was as good as or better than anyone else who has received that award. (Of course, the whole concept of awards for art... etc, and so on, blah blah... but still.)https://twitter.com/leverus/status/955980965322657792

955952484836626432 2018-01-23 23:56:47 UTC <MariaHaskins> So many books. I can't say anything about her that would mean more than all the words she wrote herself.  Heartbroken.  https://buff.ly/2F6xLIUpic.twitter.com/ETOXesyvaq

955947707859783680 2018-01-23 23:37:48 UTC <MariaHaskins> This one hurts.  Ursula K. Le Guin shaped me as a writer, a reader & a person in ways I don't even understand myself.

955582461458567168 2018-01-22 23:26:27 UTC <MariaHaskins> @jskurella  Thank you!
955581424630824960 2018-01-22 23:22:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> For extra cringe-points, I present to you my high school essay on Bradbury - in Swedish, written on a gdmn mechanical typewriter:https://mariahaskins.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/throwback-thursday-some-old-school-ray-bradbury-love/
955577999918751744 2018-01-22 23:08:43 UTC <MariaHaskins> @AuthorizedMusin Yeah, it's almost like ignorance is a superpower? The Goosebump episode my daughter watched when they did this was SO SAD. One kid who is all alone in the world because she hadn't realized she's actually dead. I think that attracts me too... that sadness and loneliness of it.
955576391923191811 2018-01-22 23:02:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> @AuthorizedMusin That's it! I'm a sucker for these stories. The Others with Nicole Kidman is another example. For some reason, that whole trope is also one of my worst nightmares - that I'd walk around and be dead and not even know it... Probably unlikely to happen, but you never know I guess?

955573157909467139 2018-01-22 22:49:29 UTC <MariaHaskins> @LLMadridWriter I used to give my kids one or two dollars. Then one of their friends said she gets five or ten! After that, I've forgotten to pay...   I have assorted teeth laying around in small plastic bags. Handy for magic / summoning / DNA research? I don't know...
955572215747043329 2018-01-22 22:45:44 UTC <MariaHaskins> I literally can't with this. I CAN'T! I know it's silly but my name is next to Ray Bradbury on that cover. WTF.  *agitated flapping*pic.twitter.com/csXz0wZAyl

955512601328328704 2018-01-22 18:48:51 UTC <MariaHaskins> This essay is so damn good.   It also reminds me that one thing I love about Jemisin's Broken Earth series is that instead of focusing on the detailed mechanics of the magic-science, it deals with what a society would be like if there were people who could DO magic.https://twitter.com/charliejane/status/955483496453046272
955509446234419200 2018-01-22 18:36:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> Watching the old Goosebumps TV-show while working (one kiddo is home sick) and I've just realized that one of my favourite horror tropes is the person who is a ghost but doesn't realize it. I can see that twist coming a mile away usually, but I still freaking love it.pic.twitter.com/qmyFrKfdOU
955508385054519298 2018-01-22 18:32:06 UTC <MariaHaskins> @premeesaurus Not sure if anyone has suggested Tidbeck's Amatka, but it has bit of a Le Guin-ish vibe. Repino's 'Mort(e)' is a bit mor action-y, but a very strange version of dystopia / possible utopia. (Animals become sentient. Ants want to rule the world.)
955507514849685504 2018-01-22 18:28:38 UTC <MariaHaskins> I love this book. My daughter loved this book. SO GOOD.https://twitter.com/amightygirl/status/955506721358864385

953758177807425536 2018-01-17 22:37:24 UTC <MariaHaskins> I am still quietly terrified of it happening to me again. But I'm also trying to take care of myself & my life so that it won't happen. But who knows?   /end rant
953758176976945152 2018-01-17 22:37:24 UTC <MariaHaskins> Sure, it might be depression or anxiety or life conditions beneath the surface, but the actual thing that happens to you as a writer is that you are unable to write, that the thing you used to love to do, makes you feel scared & sick & nothing sticks on the page.
953758176058290176 2018-01-17 22:37:23 UTC <MariaHaskins> I agree that there are many different things that can cause a person to be unable to write, but to say "writer's block is a myth, just write through it" just tells me you were probably never as deep in that hole as you might think you were.
953758175009763329 2018-01-17 22:37:23 UTC <MariaHaskins> I've read so many blog posts & articles about how "there is no such thing as writer's block", and I guess in that case I'm a f-ing unicorn, because I could not write any fiction for over 10 years, no matter how much I read or how many cups of tea I drank.

953337263957643264 2018-01-16 18:44:50 UTC <MariaHaskins> there is an epidemic of sexual abuse against people with intellectual disabilities. These crimes go mostly unrecognized, unprosecuted and unpunished. A frequent result was that the abuser was free to abuse again. The survivor is often re-victimized...https://buff.ly/2DD84QA

953103526623719424 2018-01-15 03:16:03 UTC <MariaHaskins> @AuthorizedMusin It seems to be working for the kids! I'm seriously impressed. None of them have played it before & they just kind of decided to do it. The Beginner Set was good, but they're already wondering what story to get next. :)
953102329070276608 2018-01-15 03:11:17 UTC <MariaHaskins> @AuthorizedMusin Yeah, I mean, it's really the kind of game where it's a heck of a lot easier to get into it if you have a group of friend who want to play.  Got to wonder how many kids are getting hooked on D&D because of Stranger Things?
953100768768278528 2018-01-15 03:05:05 UTC <MariaHaskins> @AuthorizedMusin OK, I am definitely taking it as a compliment, then!  When & where I grew up I know there was one group of kids who played D&D (tabletop) but we didn't hang out, and they kind of kept to themselves mostly, at least when it came to playing.

953099233845899264 2018-01-15 02:58:59 UTC <MariaHaskins> For a while I thought the sheer difficulty of figuring everything out would defeat them (what dice? what is this? how do you...?), and there's a lot of jargon even on some of the "newbie sites"... but they persevered, found some good how-to vids & ended up HAVING FUN. So good.

953097603549315072 2018-01-15 02:52:31 UTC <MariaHaskins> It's been an interesting ride to follow the kids on these last few weeks. They ended up doing their character creations through http://DNDbeyond.com because they thought it "looked better".
953097342244155392 2018-01-15 02:51:28 UTC <MariaHaskins> I never played pen & paper D&D growing up - small town, it wasn't a thing in my circle of friends - and I came to RPGs mainly through Origin's Ultima games and online games like UO & Everquest.
953096880493232131 2018-01-15 02:49:38 UTC <MariaHaskins> I haven't watched the show myself, but I'm taking this as a compliment? Regardless, it was a pretty big parenting win moment.
953096515223879680 2018-01-15 02:48:11 UTC <MariaHaskins> After binge-watching Stranger Things and then reading up on pen & paper D&D online and elsewhere, my daughter and her two best friends just played their first D&D game (using The Beginner's Set). THEY LOVED IT. They also told me "you're kind of like the mom in Stranger Things".

952566413411020800 2018-01-14 15:41:45 UTC <MariaHaskins> Today I'd like to offer thanks to all the thoughtful, helpful editors out there.

950455022206136320 2018-01-08 19:51:50 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ShimmerStories @DebbieUrbanski I had one version where I tried to pick one time as "the present" and do everything as short flashbacks. And one more linear one, that didn't include the flash forward to close to present day. I wasn't happy with either of those and ended up just kind of shattering the timeline.

950441619869675520 2018-01-08 18:58:35 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ShimmerStories @DebbieUrbanski Btw, this tweet makes me writerly happy in so many ways. One of the main issues for me when I was writing this piece was how to deal with a story that takes place over such a long stretch of time. I tried a few different approaches before settling on this one.

950120153986973696 2018-01-07 21:41:11 UTC <MariaHaskins> If anyone else is up for submitting to the #WordCountPodcast (no pay, write a story & record it yourself, can't be more than 7 min, and it is a lot of fun!) - check out the submission call for the upcoming episode #72: http://rbwood.com/dir/index.php/2018/01/04/submission-call-episode-72-of-the-word-count-podcast/
950118593127002112 2018-01-07 21:34:59 UTC <MariaHaskins> @rbwood @mareasie It's like my writing therapy / writing group. Even on a bad month, I have decided I will always have SOMETHING for the theme / keyword and feel I've accomplished at least one thing that month.  Friendly venue, good stories read by the authors, and a good host (that's you, R.B.).
950117729687650304 2018-01-07 21:31:33 UTC <MariaHaskins> @mareasie Haaaa! NO! (I wish!) But the submission process is a bit more straightforward for @rbwood's podcast. No pay, done for the fun of it, and keep it under 7 minutes. (So flash, basically.)

949474421156147200 2018-01-05 02:55:17 UTC <MariaHaskins> @DarkMatterzine Exactly - sometimes I KNOW other people would love / have loved a book but I just can't get any traction. (And the other way 'round.) Diff'rent strokes and all that... When I was younger I might have argued the virtues / flaws more, but these days I just let it go.
949464070905724928 2018-01-05 02:14:09 UTC <MariaHaskins> @DarkMatterzine Yeah, this is me, too. I'll give it a good go, but sometimes ... I just know it's not for me. Nothing happens, terrible prose, subject matter... it can be a lot of different things.
949463721100718080 2018-01-05 02:12:45 UTC <MariaHaskins> @AlteredInstinct Just reading more YA / middle grade has been a HUGE eye-opener for me. There are so many FANTASTIC books out there & the subtle differences from "books for adults" are interesting to note (and they can be VERY subtle).
949462308262002689 2018-01-05 02:07:09 UTC <MariaHaskins> I've never really had that "perfect reader" that Stephen King talks about (for him it's his wife), but my daughter might be close to it. I won't let her read all my stuff yet (she's 10), but just knowing how she thinks about / reacts to stories has actually been helpful.
949461689476329473 2018-01-05 02:04:41 UTC <MariaHaskins> I try to have that in the back of my mind when writing now. Is it clear who it's about? Is there something there to show where it is, and what kind of story this might be? Not to front-load too much, but at least hint.  I still flunk all the time, but I do try to think about it.
949459786176765952 2018-01-05 01:57:07 UTC <MariaHaskins> And after that, she's looking for something to happen. Doesn't have to be much, but something that has the character DO something, and that shows what kind of story it is - will there be pirates? aliens? dragons? magic? is someone missing? in danger?
949459187225866240 2018-01-05 01:54:44 UTC <MariaHaskins> This made my think about how reading books w my kids has given me a more straight-forward way of thinking about my own work. My daughter is super harsh when she reads - "who is it about?" is the main thing she wants to know by page 1 or 2. "Where is it?" is usually the next q.https://twitter.com/dongwon/status/949405584419246080

949049230781399041 2018-01-04 22:45:43 UTC <MariaHaskins> For example, a recent study in Sweden showed that doctors often ignore / brush off women having problems after giving birth, if they experienced tearing and had to have stitches. Women complaining were made to understand that some pain was "normal".

946866328672993281 2017-12-29 22:11:39 UTC <MariaHaskins> @LisetteBrodey And totally in an unthinking fashion in this case! They were honestly surprised when I bit back (though I tried to control myself). And even then they tried to explain to me how I had somehow not grasped the enormity of the issue... ? Why would anyone do this?

945524627828195328 2017-12-25 05:20:12 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ECthetwit I know. It's hard when you can't use it but you don't want to throw it out.
945523419520450560 2017-12-25 05:15:24 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ECthetwit My mom thought it was too pretty to be used for the seat cover, though!
945523087511928832 2017-12-25 05:14:05 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ECthetwit It's hung on a special hanger to be displayed on the wall right now (making it a "rana" in Swedish), but farmor originally made it to be used as the cover for an old Swedish bench/couch (with a padded, upholstered lid/seat and a storage compartment or bed below the seat).
945522411964788736 2017-12-25 05:11:24 UTC <MariaHaskins> @finstergrrrl  I love it so much. My parents downsized this year, moving into an apartment, and they are gifting a lot of old family things to us kids and to the grandkids. It's sad and lovely all at once.
945519755057704960 2017-12-25 05:00:51 UTC <MariaHaskins> My parents gave it to me as a Christmas present today. Made me think of my farmor. Still miss her.pic.twitter.com/975uJkC4PN

944743073208197120 2017-12-23 01:34:35 UTC <MariaHaskins> @Th3Curator I did one batch as an experiment, just to see how much water I could mix into it, and I probably mixed in almost 1/4 cup water after it was "done". It stayed slimey and that's the first batch that really got stretchy.  (I have made too much slime, I realize from typing all this.)
944742442389012480 2017-12-23 01:32:05 UTC <MariaHaskins> @Th3Curator So if it's too stiff / not stretchy enough, I mix/knead the slime in a bowl with a couple of tablespoons of water at a time until it's good. When you mix in water after, it first seems to go too gluey, but if you keep stirring/ kneading it , it "slime-ifies" again after a bit.
944741992856150016 2017-12-23 01:30:18 UTC <MariaHaskins> @Th3Curator Elmer's glue and borax. 1/2 cup glue mixed with 1/2 cup water. Separately mix 1/2 cup warm water with 1/2 tsp borax. Pour and stir borax mix into glue mix. The trick though, as I've discovered, is that you can mix in small amounts of water afterwards, if it's too stiff.

944271214159081472 2017-12-22 18:19:35 UTC <MariaHaskins> @stevetoase Exactly. You have to take the pieces of gold buried in all the gravel, right? :)
944271010001444864 2017-12-22 18:18:47 UTC <MariaHaskins> Read different markets, know where you might send a story off to next & keep trying. Keep reading, keep writing, keep submitting. It's a difficult thing to write a good story. It's a difficult thing to get published. It's difficult to handle rejections. But it is not impossible.
944270435381690368 2017-12-22 18:16:30 UTC <MariaHaskins> The only advice I have for how to handle the pain of rejections is to a) be ready for it to happen, b) try to learn from it if any feedback is offered, c) keep reading and reading and reading what other people are writing, d) and keep writing and submitting. Don't give up.
944270081403449344 2017-12-22 18:15:05 UTC <MariaHaskins> REJECTIONS SUCK. On a personal level, they always suck. They sting. But sometimes you get some feedback that helps. Sometimes you make it to the second round / final round and you figure you can't be all crap. Sometimes you even get acceptances. You keep going. And going.
944269701374345216 2017-12-22 18:13:35 UTC <MariaHaskins> I read Stephen King's On Writing about all HIS rejection letters early in his career. I read stories about other writers who got rejected a lot (writers I love) & decided that I wasn't going to let all the inevitable rejections beat me down. I'd try to learn, and get back up.
944269361258229760 2017-12-22 18:12:14 UTC <MariaHaskins> When I decided to come back to writing a few years ago, one of the things I had to do, was to mentally prepare myself for TONS AND TONS of rejections. I'm not a big name author. I have not gone to any big-name workshops / courses. I am terrified of people hating what I write.
944269360356474880 2017-12-22 18:12:13 UTC <MariaHaskins> Some personal thoughts on handling rejections:  I suck at handling criticism of any kind. I am a thin-skinned, squishy marshmallow of insecurity. When I was younger, this held me back a lot. I was terrified of submitting stories cold, because they might get rejected.

944239653946761217 2017-12-22 16:14:11 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ECthetwit The more I read of the new SFF published right now, the less hurt I am by rejections: there are SO MANY great stories and writers. No shame in getting a rejection when there are so many awesome stories around.
944238429868617729 2017-12-22 16:09:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ShimmerStories @LoraJGray Woooo! Congratulations!
944237437672349696 2017-12-22 16:05:22 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ShimmerStories I am not exactly "bankable", and Shimmer was one of my first sales when I came back to writing. I see a lot of new names in Shimmer as well as established writers. Submitting is a hard slog for everyone, and being a newbie is hard, but it is not impossible.

940662356438278144 2017-12-12 19:19:17 UTC <MariaHaskins> I have more. But some characters, like these, grab at your heartstrings in a way as if they were people you got to know IRL. And you just kind of miss them when the book is over.  It's a good thing, but man, now I want more books...
940660369105739776 2017-12-12 19:11:23 UTC <MariaHaskins> I'd follow Mort(e) and D'Arc, from @Repino1's books 'Mort(e)' and 'D'Arc' absolutely anywhere. Those characters are so compelling & interesting (and the fact they were formerly a cat and a dog... well, that adds to the attraction).pic.twitter.com/UofOD128zz
940659339345276928 2017-12-12 19:07:17 UTC <MariaHaskins> I'd follow @AngelaSlatter's Verity Fassbinder (from Vigil & Corpselight & the upcoming Restoration) ANYWHERE. I miss her after finishing each book.  Same goes for Slatter's Patience Gideon (from Of Sorrow and Such - and other stories). LOVE her.pic.twitter.com/znOqk84vt3

939658000008085504 2017-12-09 00:48:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> She says the story is about the cost of the journey. That when you journey to yesterday, you lay waste to today. When you return, your today is gone and it is a today that belongs to somebody else.   Wow. 'Sidewalks' - @maureenmcq @omnimagazine https://buff.ly/2kQe3MVpic.twitter.com/0v3AAAsnkS

939650844877668352 2017-12-09 00:19:53 UTC <MariaHaskins> Pro-tip: never ever EVER start cleaning your walls. At first it's all fun and games and you're only cleaning a small spot, but pretty soon there is dirt dirt dirt nothing but dirt and you are trapped forever with a rag and lysol wiping the walls down until the universe implodes.

938536612291420160 2017-12-06 22:32:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> My tips to anyone wanting to review on a regular basis would be: be open-minded, read outside your comfort zone on a regular basis, write about things you love, and try not to burn out.   
938536093367992320 2017-12-06 22:30:16 UTC <MariaHaskins> I love to read other people's reviews and rec's. I love to dip in and out of publications, I love to read my "regular" zines, I love to read writers I haven't heard of and getting my socks knocked off.
938534120430301184 2017-12-06 22:22:26 UTC <MariaHaskins> I hope that if I write about stories and music, someone out there might discover a story or a tune they would not have found otherwise, and they might find more on their own after that.  Again: It is very easy to feel absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of great work out there.
938533646738194432 2017-12-06 22:20:33 UTC <MariaHaskins> I try to be open to new things (new bands / music / authors / types of stories) because, well, because I LIKE to be surprised and get that "WOW" feeling from a story or tune.  But my lists are not "best of". They are my favourites out of all the things I've read/listened to.
938533197679280128 2017-12-06 22:18:46 UTC <MariaHaskins> As a reviewer / someone who posts about / recommends stories & music, I know that there is an OVERWHELMING amount of fantastic stuff being created. I can't write about all of it. All I can do is read /listen and write about some of the things I love. No one can cover all of it.
938532792723324928 2017-12-06 22:17:09 UTC <MariaHaskins> Before I started reviewing #sff short fiction, I reviewed music (mainly rock/metal from the indie-scene) at https://realrockandroll.wordpress.com/. I still do.   There is SO MUCH GOOD STUFF out there in that music scene. Young bands doing amazing things that you never hear of in the mainstream.
938531651423911938 2017-12-06 22:12:37 UTC <MariaHaskins> So much truth in this whole thread.https://twitter.com/ClowderofTwo/status/938530736319225856

938517683460497408 2017-12-06 21:17:07 UTC <MariaHaskins> @stevetoase Thank you so much!
938515522173337601 2017-12-06 21:08:31 UTC <MariaHaskins> @pauljessup Yeah, it can really help to see those sample stories. I love zines that give those hints!
938515223006167040 2017-12-06 21:07:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> I guess the moral of the story (or my answer, as poorly as I explained it irl), is that every publication has a voice or vibe, and that this is NOT the same as genre. And reading a zine is the fun, non-shortcut-ish way of becoming familiar with it.
938514258769227776 2017-12-06 21:03:30 UTC <MariaHaskins> You can't always read 5-10 stories of a publication before sending them your work. But at the VERY least, read the guidelines & try to read a couple of stories to get familiar with the vibe. If nothing else, you might read some excellent fiction, amirite?
938513740005175296 2017-12-06 21:01:27 UTC <MariaHaskins> You might not be able to describe that difference easily in words (without rambling), but as a writer, you will most likely know when a story fits, or at least when it does not fit at all.  IMO, the only real way to "know" the voice is reading a publication. No real shortcuts.
938513266417922048 2017-12-06 20:59:34 UTC <MariaHaskins> Sure, some of the stories that fit into one, might also have fit in the other. BUT, overall, I'd say that if you read 5 stories from BCS and 5 stories from Shimmer, you will have a pretty good idea of the voice of each zine & how they differ.
938512732139040768 2017-12-06 20:57:26 UTC <MariaHaskins> "So it's genre? Like one does fantasy, one does scifi, one does horror?" No. Genre is not voice.  Example: Two of my favourite publications as a reader are @ShimmerStories & @BCSmagazine. I LOVE these zines. They also have very different voices.
938512153698476032 2017-12-06 20:55:08 UTC <MariaHaskins> Was trying to explain "voice" to a person offline, in the context of different publications / zines having their own "voices".  Q: "How can you figure it out, though?" A: Read the guidelines, 'cause they'll probably tell you, and might even include sample stories as examples. 1/?

936465420294397952 2017-11-30 05:22:09 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ECthetwit 4. It only gets worse from there. 5. It does take place on Mars, so there is that.
936465259065352192 2017-11-30 05:21:31 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ECthetwit One day I will send you my unfinished novel from my young 'un days: 1. HUMONGOUS mysterious prologue. 2. Protagonist wakes up. 3. Part of it was all a dream.

936431222565117952 2017-11-30 03:06:16 UTC <MariaHaskins> Story deadline tomorrow. Just took on a translation job I probably should have passed on, but hey, it pays and who needs sleep before next Wednesday anyway? Now I'm having a panic attack.

936257070361276416 2017-11-30 15:34:15 UTC <MariaHaskins> Charles is doing great work. If you're interested in reviewing short SFF, read this thread, and read Quick Sip Reviews.https://twitter.com/ClowderofTwo/status/936251531040645120

936255420112314368 2017-11-30 15:27:41 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ClowderofTwo @pauljessup @thisjulieday Yeah, seeing one of these kinds of f'd up reviews, it's one thing. But when you see the pattern... there is a deep-seated problem and bias coming through.

936253736665563136 2017-11-30 15:21:00 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ClowderofTwo @thisjulieday @pauljessup Yeah, so many of the reviews seem like transparent attempts to make the writers feel small - not critique the stories.
936253122959122432 2017-11-30 15:18:33 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ClowderofTwo @thisjulieday @pauljessup Apart from the issues they seem to have with...well, everything, the TONE also really gets to me. It's dismissive and just plain rude a lot of the time. Why would you review stories in that way? It's like bullying in faux-review form.
936252618904498176 2017-11-30 15:16:33 UTC <MariaHaskins> @tithenai I am so sorry you had to go through this BS. It's outrageous that this border-crap can get so idiotically cruel.
936250519164674048 2017-11-30 15:08:13 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ClowderofTwo @thisjulieday Thank you, and I also agree with your thoughts on RSR. I haven't been keeping up with them, and reading them now... I am horrified.

936019755042988032 2017-11-29 23:51:14 UTC <MariaHaskins> @RoseLemberg I'm f-ing livid seeing these examples. This isn't reviewing.
936018890764705792 2017-11-29 23:47:48 UTC <MariaHaskins> @jheijndermans  I'm erasing the poor thing bit by bit.   "Mom, I can't feel my legs or my arms!" "There, there.... it'll all be over soon..."
936018193562288128 2017-11-29 23:45:02 UTC <MariaHaskins> Short story progress today: one character erased completely from WIP. Suddenly, everything becomes clearer and the word count is going down. I think I'm on the right track.
936017831254048768 2017-11-29 23:43:35 UTC <MariaHaskins> @RoseLemberg Ugh ugh ugh ugh! EVERYTHING I read by this "reviewer" makes me cringe. That dismissive tone... OMG.

These narrators made my stories sound fantastic. 
935992388278919168 2017-11-29 22:02:29 UTC <MariaHaskins> @RoseLemberg WOW. That is the most shallow possible reading of that story.   Ugh.
935991828729303040 2017-11-29 22:00:16 UTC <MariaHaskins> @merylstenhouse I just saw that! :)))) So very cool.

935984988155101184 2017-11-29 21:33:05 UTC <MariaHaskins> Would it really be worse if "the robots take over", or "the aliens invade"? I mean, really? Worse? Worse than a garbage fire burning in a flaming dumpster placed in the middle of a fiery mountain of refuse?
935975685310447617 2017-11-29 20:56:07 UTC <MariaHaskins> @premeesaurus It's all perfectly natural! And ecological! And biodegradable! Very environmentally friendly!   *smiles awkwardly*

935737413976064000 2017-11-28 05:09:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> @lchanwrites The Swedish version of mulled wine, basically. It smells of Christmas and winter and spices and vodka and red wine and everything good.

935016662486491136 2017-11-26 05:25:18 UTC <MariaHaskins> @katoscope She's really good at math, too! AND she LIKES math, which is something I'm quietly freaking out about because it makes me so happy.
935016494982819840 2017-11-26 05:24:38 UTC <MariaHaskins> I'm so mad I want to scream.   I am not screaming.
935016184923041792 2017-11-26 05:23:24 UTC <MariaHaskins> @PintsNCupcakes "I guess they learn things a different way now."  Yep. Yep, they do.
935015722291306496 2017-11-26 05:21:34 UTC <MariaHaskins> @katoscope "I'm helping her learn stuff."  This person is not a teacher and let's just say their teaching methods are suspect...
935015263920992256 2017-11-26 05:19:45 UTC <MariaHaskins> Kiddo is doing math. Grownup comes over, and instead of asking her what she's doing so she can show them, proceeds to give her some dumb-ass math ahead of her grade and then sigh and roll eyes when she can't do it.  WTF.

934902377190060033 2017-11-26 21:51:11 UTC <MariaHaskins> @natalia_theodor I KNOW! I tried to get out of making this all week because I thought it would be a nightmare. Turns out it was relatively easy to make, and OMG, how can regular white glue, water and frikking borax turn into this IN SECONDS? Chemistry  = magic.

934863240223322112 2017-11-26 19:15:40 UTC <MariaHaskins> @sk_farrell I've pretty much banned glitter from our house and now the kiddo is like, "the glitter slime is really cool!".  I have to be strong and resist.
934862953127460864 2017-11-26 19:14:31 UTC <MariaHaskins> @sk_farrell Glitter omg... such a health hazard! LOL. When my kids were in preschool they sometimes sneezed glitter. Eeek!
934862138790707200 2017-11-26 19:11:17 UTC <MariaHaskins> @sk_farrell I refused to do this all week when my kid was asking me to try, and now I'm hunting for more glue all over the house...
934861861224202240 2017-11-26 19:10:11 UTC <MariaHaskins> @sk_farrell Mix 1/2 cup elmer's school glue with 1/2 cup water.  Add desired food colouring.  Dissolve 1/2 tsp borax (UGH!) in 1/2 cup warm water.  Stir the borax-water into the glue mix and it freaking becomes slime like gotdamn instantly!  (Serious hand-washing mandatory etc.)
934859609474347008 2017-11-26 19:01:14 UTC <MariaHaskins> This slime-making thing is addictive. It's like chemistry, but with slime! I might give up all other activities and just make slime full-time.  Sort of like a slug, I guess?pic.twitter.com/QehuaAQW9n

933167456087969792 2017-11-21 02:57:13 UTC <MariaHaskins> @mareasie @writerjencrow Even thinking about it now I start to laugh. It was so bad.
933166939525939200 2017-11-21 02:55:10 UTC <MariaHaskins> @mareasie @writerjencrow I had to make two costumes for my kid when she was in drama class. One was a snake (it was epically hilarious), and the other was a duck costume. I made this duck mask that look sort of like a zombie Howard the Duck mask I guess? I burst out laughing when she came on stage...

933162695590797313 2017-11-21 02:38:18 UTC <MariaHaskins> @writerjencrow Yeah! That would have been a real emergency! This was a spur of the moment craft project...

933069680314540032 2017-11-21 20:28:42 UTC <MariaHaskins> @FoxesandRoses I know I shouldn't even be shocked anymore. But it is so ENRAGING.
933069518439464960 2017-11-21 20:28:03 UTC <MariaHaskins> @FoxesandRoses It does seems from what I can figure out online that he's married to someone in Svenska Akademien who gives out the Nobel Prize in lit, and that he has received funding from them.
933069286876131328 2017-11-21 20:27:08 UTC <MariaHaskins> @FoxesandRoses Dagens Nyheter. 18 women came forward to talk about it. And I listened to Studio Ett where they interviewed a couple of women with knowledge of the situation. They knew he was bad, but I think the rapes shocked even them.

Something about me and leaks: last year I managed to be standing right next to the water heater when it started leaking. Am I causing it? Or lucky to be in the right spot?
933050802142289920 2017-11-21 19:13:41 UTC <MariaHaskins> @csecooney Yeah, luckily I caught the leak as it started so limited puddling... Will have a look at it this afternoon. Floor's dry now, so I WILL WRITE.

(I once saw a movie about Henrik VIII where the Swedish translator had translated "hose" (hosiery) into "slang" "water hose", meaning the king had trouble putting on his water hose. SO CONFUSING!)

932461844479983616 2017-11-19 04:13:22 UTC <MariaHaskins> @GwendolynKiste's Pretty Marys All In A Row is a fantastic novella. (It's out Nov 28.)  I'm halfway through @silviamg's The Beautiful Ones & it is an absolute delight to read.  Just started @jeannette_ng's The Pendulum Sun & it spins magic from the first chapter.

932436881089761280 2017-11-19 02:34:10 UTC <MariaHaskins> @aimeepicchi Yeah, I wonder, too! Not sure if it would be just a waste of time to lobby for a new category in the established awards. And starting a new award would require some serious leg-work.

932356301434191872 2017-11-19 21:13:59 UTC <MariaHaskins> @writerjencrow Yeah. I think there's such a different kind of dynamic you have to go for. And I've read so much amazing flash this year!

I'd never really thought of it before 2012 when I started writing for that site myself... but it was eye-opening.
932058423465730048 2017-11-18 01:30:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> @PintsNCupcakes I mean, it's my music site, and there's no "style sheet" but I enforced this for myself as a style sheet. And I was appalled at myself for slipping this way... On the music site I also NEVER comment on performer's looks - male or female, but I see it a lot elsewhere.
932058041289027584 2017-11-18 01:28:48 UTC <MariaHaskins> @PintsNCupcakes This is so interesting to me. When I started reviewing music, I realized that for some reason I almost did this. I always refer to people by first + last name on first mention, then only use last name. BUT for women I sometimes slipped up. I consciously corrected myself but yea.

931546691546898432 2017-11-17 15:36:53 UTC <MariaHaskins> He speaks of that ritual of light and color, of those prayers of song and silt.

929742195782967296 2017-11-12 16:06:27 UTC <MariaHaskins> Exactly. The pressure for girls (and sometimes kids, boys and girls) to be "nice" is really strong. I don't want her to be thoughtlessly rude, but I also don't want her to feel like it's inherently wrong to get angry and show it.
929741809282039808 2017-11-12 16:04:55 UTC <MariaHaskins> @PixelatedPirate  I think you are. :)

929623707370131456 2017-11-12 08:15:38 UTC <MariaHaskins> @dmgillis I watch the kids around me, the ones I know, my own and other's, and I wish I had sharper claws and teeth to defend them. The world is so wonderful and so gdmn SHITTY at the same time.
929620667741323264 2017-11-12 08:03:33 UTC <MariaHaskins> @dmgillis  A difficult thing to share, but thank you for sharing it. It happens to so many boys, so many girls. So many. Too many. And how I wish there was dragon's fire for every perpetrator.
929611806514876416 2017-11-11 07:28:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> In short:pic.twitter.com/AplA1aJIih
929610837894950912 2017-11-11 07:24:29 UTC <MariaHaskins> It can be super hard to be difficult and rude and angry and NOT SMILE, because smiling is the easiest way to try to smooth things over and make ourselves appear less threatening, and less threatened... but maybe we need to remember how to show our teeth more and smile less.
929610104592261120 2017-11-11 07:21:34 UTC <MariaHaskins> And I think about how important it is that we allow our kids, our daughters, ourselves to be obnoxious and selfish and loud and ornery and say NO NO NO I DON'T WANT TO, rather than just laugh and smile and hope it goes away.
929609652190375936 2017-11-11 07:19:47 UTC <MariaHaskins> And I think about how people tell me she should be more polite and less loud. And how I, again, even when it almost kills me, try to give her the space to say NO NO NO really loud, and LISTEN TO ME I HAVE STUFF TO SAY even when she bugs the ever-living crap out of me.
929609298765742080 2017-11-11 07:18:22 UTC <MariaHaskins> I keep thinking about these monstrous men preying on women, and I think about my child, my daughter. How she refuses to smile in photos, and how people tell me to "make her smile, it's just a photo", and how I just keep saying, no, she has to decide that on her own.

925837448915034112 2017-11-01 21:30:23 UTC <MariaHaskins> Some things I suck at: - writing an outline - writing a pitch - backstroke - not eating salted licorice if I have salted licorice
925836698436567042 2017-11-01 21:27:24 UTC <MariaHaskins> @FoggWriter I think doing this makes it easier for me to skip the "dead wood" parts. Sometimes I get stuck in the more linear storytelling...
925813272137277440 2017-11-01 19:54:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> Me, whenever I'm having a hard time with a story: smash it into several POV's and/or timelines. FRAGMENTATION IS MY ANSWER.

922279770930286592 2017-10-22 01:53:27 UTC <MariaHaskins> So glad I got to say hello to @JaimeOMayer at #SiWC17 - proving that it is possible to sort of identify people from Twitter photos.

922208466797674496 2017-10-22 21:10:06 UTC <MariaHaskins> What a fantastic workshop. My brain filled to brim and overflowing with tropes and themes and ways to twist and bend them... excellent.
922208257866833920 2017-10-22 21:09:17 UTC <MariaHaskins> This panel was SO MUCH fun. Great hearing writers talk process without preaching a one fits all solution.
922207624124293120 2017-10-22 21:06:46 UTC <MariaHaskins> @sillysyntax We had a couple a few years ago but hung up... those are scary, because yeah, they can talk people into real nightmares. :(

922206023292612608 2017-10-22 21:00:24 UTC <MariaHaskins> @sillysyntax TOTALLY! Offer me some astronomical cash! Threaten my PayPal account! Something!
922204621187072000 2017-10-22 20:54:50 UTC <MariaHaskins> @sillysyntax  I'm like, DUDE, you have to try harder.

922126731414192128 2017-10-22 15:45:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> @apexmag @RoanhorseBex When I hear people ask "but what IS cultural appropriation?" I want to hand them this story. It has a dark sense of humour & so much depth.
922125991312535552 2017-10-22 15:42:23 UTC <MariaHaskins> Stayed up way too late last night reading @lamplightmag vol 6/ issue 1: fantastic creepy, dark, unsettling fiction.https://buff.ly/2yBysui
922124848645705729 2017-10-22 15:37:50 UTC <MariaHaskins> This whole issue of @apexmag (guest editor @drahsturgis) is brilliant: with @sometimesal @justicedanielh & more.https://buff.ly/2xXvT0Y
922123886610788354 2017-10-22 15:34:01 UTC <MariaHaskins> I think about this story a lot: 'Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience' by @RoanhorseBex / @apexmag. SO good. https://buff.ly/2xXjp9Zpic.twitter.com/cIhq1HH2op

921997439841607680 2017-10-22 07:11:34 UTC <MariaHaskins> @mattneilhill Perry's workshop was mostly focused on novel-writing, but she also uses a simplified version for short stories. I'll have to try it out!
921994214014992384 2017-10-21 06:58:45 UTC <MariaHaskins> @mattneilhill Still processing most of it ... I have never done much outlining at all, but this really got me thinking about it.
921994062252556293 2017-10-21 06:58:08 UTC <MariaHaskins> @mattneilhill for example, to make sure you deliver right info in beginning & insert turning points & other dramatic structure where its needed.
921993755778998272 2017-10-21 06:56:55 UTC <MariaHaskins> @mattneilhill Things I wrote down at the workshop today: be flexible w the outline and  change it if needed.. And: use it for pacing -
921957016255397889 2017-10-21 04:30:56 UTC <MariaHaskins> @WriterOdell 
921955968375693313 2017-10-21 04:26:46 UTC <MariaHaskins> @WriterOdell My brain is SPENT, but it was another awesome day. I love this conference because it's close enough that I can go home every night! LOL.
921955689261539328 2017-10-21 04:25:40 UTC <MariaHaskins> And she teaches process as a tool, to use if it suits the individual & the story they want to tell: while saying it's not the only way.
921955050112421890 2017-10-21 04:23:07 UTC <MariaHaskins> This was another excellent workshop by Mary Robinette Kowal: fun, informative, engaging & structured in a way that makes it easy to apply.
921954536603787264 2017-10-21 04:21:05 UTC <MariaHaskins> Same for the characters: why am I choosing these characters? what assumptions am I making about them?    (My brain is still processing...)
921954126786740224 2017-10-21 04:19:27 UTC <MariaHaskins> And to think one step further: why am I writing the society this way? what assumptions am I making? why do I choose to make those choices?
921952681203187714 2017-10-21 04:13:42 UTC <MariaHaskins> One great takeaway for me is that it is ALWAYS a good idea to consider the power structure of a society when you do world-building.
921952278885498880 2017-10-21 04:12:06 UTC <MariaHaskins> so I can get better at seeing "through" my own prose. I'm a looseygoosey pantser by nature, but I just want to be more aware of what I do.
921951637236727808 2017-10-21 04:09:34 UTC <MariaHaskins> that I might (or might not) be doing anyway. I have some good writing instincts, I think, but I want to understand the process/my process 2/
921951330385543170 2017-10-21 04:08:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> One thing I love about the workshops & panels I've done at @SiWCtweets is that I'm learning how to consciously do / understand things 1/
921950317150744576 2017-10-21 04:04:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> This was a really great workshop. It gave me tools on how to think about story structure, as much as it made me consider outlining.
921949386774425600 2017-10-21 04:00:37 UTC <MariaHaskins> I realized in this workshop that an outline can be used to diagnose story-problems - a way to analyze a story that isn't working.
921946157110190080 2017-10-21 03:47:47 UTC <MariaHaskins> Backstage with Josephine Baker, Venice, 1949 https://buff.ly/2xVBoClpic.twitter.com/QiXSA8Le8M

921935359885242368 2017-10-21 03:04:53 UTC <MariaHaskins> Great story by Damien Angelica Walters in @lamplightmag 'All the Pretty Cages' - wings and voices, scars and truths...https://twitter.com/lamplightmag/status/921461126319300609
921932484647862272 2017-10-21 02:53:27 UTC <MariaHaskins> @WriterOdell It's a complete farce that De Vos and 45 have any power what-so-ever over the school system.
921924280534712320 2017-10-21 02:20:51 UTC <MariaHaskins> @PintsNCupcakes I laughed in a silent hotel hallway and scared a bystander...

921572084433633280 2017-10-20 03:01:21 UTC <MariaHaskins> @PintsNCupcakes I do too! But usually the whole thing ends up too sweet in ice cream. This one is perfect.

920131626524327936 2017-10-16 03:37:29 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ECthetwit @LightHealing I saw that documentary (when he sings Hunting High And Low A Capella  on the train back in the 80s) & realized he really DID sing like that.

916412713756016640 2017-10-06 21:19:51 UTC <MariaHaskins> @medievalguy @ego_chronicon One guy talks about how Ridley would work himself up (as an actor almost) to a rage when producers visited: to get more time & money. 
916411994378346496 2017-10-06 21:17:00 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ego_chronicon @medievalguy Watching the movie back to back with Dangerous Days is like an immersive course in the art and the craft and the hustle of film-making.
916407938121469953 2017-10-06 21:00:53 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ego_chronicon @medievalguy Yeah, I wonder what it would be like to come at the movie now for a first time. I've been obsessed with it since the 80s, LOL.
916407541772435456 2017-10-06 20:59:18 UTC <MariaHaskins> @medievalguy @ego_chronicon Yeah. I've bought every damn version of this movie over the years, and I sort of love them all. Theatrical release was the one i saw 1st!
916406117210628096 2017-10-06 20:53:39 UTC <MariaHaskins> @medievalguy I have strong feelings about this. Final Cut is Ridley's "real" version & has the full unicorn scene. Director's Cut will do in a pinch...

916017759510605824 2017-10-05 19:10:27 UTC <MariaHaskins> It was considered dangerous to cut down these trees, because ALL the pain the tree had absorbed would go into you. #FolkloreThursday
916017468920827904 2017-10-05 19:09:18 UTC <MariaHaskins> #folklorethursday - in Sweden, certain trees (vrktrd/pain-trees) could "absorb" your pain if you touched the tree with an ailing limb.

913493542147727361 2017-09-28 20:00:06 UTC <MariaHaskins> @WriterOdell I think, maybe, you follow a hare at your own peril (if the hare knows what they're doing!).

910264765246717952 2017-09-19 22:10:06 UTC <MariaHaskins> I kind of know it's BS, because there were many factors behind my inability to write for all those years... (life happens sometimes)...
910264432084656129 2017-09-19 22:08:47 UTC <MariaHaskins> Like, one day I will just wake up and that inability / fear / terror of stringing words together will be back & I'll be back in the hole.

910197095700631553 2017-09-19 17:41:12 UTC <MariaHaskins> Plus, reading a lot of what's out there RIGHT NOW gives you a better feel for the "voices" of the various zines & markets.
910196666707222529 2017-09-19 17:39:30 UTC <MariaHaskins> Reading the "classics" is great (I do that too and I grew consuming the "canon"), but you also need to know what is happening around you.
910196303358869510 2017-09-19 17:38:04 UTC <MariaHaskins> As a writer, it is absolutely invaluable to read as much as you can of what other writers around you are writing.

908346927065964544 2017-09-14 15:09:18 UTC <MariaHaskins> @PintsNCupcakes YES. PJ did a great job with Boromir, but Faramir suffers... I like the relationship stuff with his dad & brother, but the rest... eh.
908345766371979265 2017-09-14 15:04:41 UTC <MariaHaskins> UGH. SO GOOD! (I'm still mad at Peter Jackson for the scene with Faramir letting his men beat up Gollum, btw...)

906163099614404609 2017-09-08 14:31:33 UTC <MariaHaskins> @saddestpark But then, who the heck needs a Nobel Prize anyway? ;) Reading that old Le Guin tale just reminded me again what wonderful writer she is.  
906162723100155904 2017-09-08 14:30:03 UTC <MariaHaskins> @saddestpark Yeah, for sure. And I don't argue with it. She's awesome. I just wish the Nobel Prize Academy wasn't such sticks in the mud for "genre" lit!
906052043646803969 2017-09-08 07:10:15 UTC <MariaHaskins> @saddestpark Yeah. They are both so good. I think Atwood has the better chance, because she's never been "branded" as a specfic writer... (weird, right?)
906048581601132545 2017-09-07 06:56:30 UTC <MariaHaskins> @Gnashchick I'm getting it too. She is just so unbelievably good: early work, later works, all of it.
906047676260564994 2017-09-07 06:52:54 UTC <MariaHaskins> I've said it before, and I'll say it again: in a just universe, Le Guin would have received the Nobel Prize in Lit a long time ago.
906045874983149569 2017-09-07 06:45:44 UTC <MariaHaskins> Oh my. Read this, and read Le Guin's story. Every time I read Le Guin, it's like I'm freshly amazed at how GOOD she is. https://twitter.com/tordotcom/status/905782618452631553

905650672648855552 2017-09-06 04:35:21 UTC <MariaHaskins> There's a cloud of noxious skunk stink still hanging over our backyard. I don't think the Febreze will work outdoors though...

905529662192762880 2017-09-06 20:34:30 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ac_wise It was a lot of fun to think up the baked goods...and make myself hungry!
905529184096804864 2017-09-06 20:32:36 UTC <MariaHaskins> Both my grandmas always made sure they had seven kinds of baked goods if it was a special occasion. SO MUCH BAKING. Store-bought was a nono.
905528743145357312 2017-09-06 20:30:50 UTC <MariaHaskins> Sugar-dreams (one of the cookies in the story) are based on "drmmar" (dreams), a Swedish cookie that was my maternal grandma's specialty.
905528438190104576 2017-09-06 20:29:38 UTC <MariaHaskins> The title's a riff on "7 sorters kakor" - "Seven kinds of cookies" which is what an oldschool fancy kaffe-klatsch / fika requires in Sweden.
905528058202882048 2017-09-06 20:28:07 UTC <MariaHaskins> About 'Seven Kinds of Baked Goods': it was one of the first stories I wrote when I started writing fiction again in 2015.

905321587636822020 2017-09-05 06:47:41 UTC <MariaHaskins> Me then was quiet. Me now would ROAR. It's like the headline: "I Dont Know How To Explain To You That You Should Care About Other People"
905320749535174656 2017-09-05 06:44:21 UTC <MariaHaskins> Two other moms whispering: "why didn't she just have the test, she must be over 35!, and then she wouldn't have all these problems."
905320571646337026 2017-09-05 06:43:38 UTC <MariaHaskins> I think about the mom of a boy with Down's Syndrome who came to a baby play group I went to with my kids.
905316587405697024 2017-09-05 06:27:49 UTC <MariaHaskins> Rant over. I think.
905316261449555969 2017-09-05 06:26:31 UTC <MariaHaskins> Human beings are "worthy". Regardless of grades, IQ, productivity, disability, addictions, criminal convictions, health problems, whatever.
905315535482568705 2017-09-05 06:23:38 UTC <MariaHaskins> As if we would make the world better by getting rid of anyone who doesn't fulfill certain criteria. As if that wouldn't make us all less.
905315196087943169 2017-09-05 06:22:17 UTC <MariaHaskins> Basically telling me they think the world would be better without my child in it...
905314760421281793 2017-09-05 06:20:33 UTC <MariaHaskins> I've heard people say that it would be better if people with developmental disabilities did not exist since they can't ever be "productive".
905313809513857025 2017-09-05 06:16:46 UTC <MariaHaskins> It's immigrants today - who is "worthy"? But I also see it all the time when talking about people w disabilities, developmental & otherwise.
905313324186734592 2017-09-05 06:14:51 UTC <MariaHaskins> It's terrifying how much of a person's worth as a human being seems to be tied to their intelligence and productivity.

900025309675659264 2017-08-22 16:02:10 UTC <MariaHaskins> @foliosociety @ECthetwit  Much as I love Tolkien, I think the writers that have influenced my own writing the most (and the longest!) are LeGuin and Bradbury.
900024435377188864 2017-08-22 15:58:41 UTC <MariaHaskins> I wrote about "The One Who Waits" here: https://mariahaskins.wordpress.com/2016/02/28/5-reasons-why-i-love-ray-bradburys-the-one-who-waits/ I really love that story & I really love Bradbury. First loves & all that.
900024074230915072 2017-08-22 15:57:15 UTC <MariaHaskins> The first sci-fi I read was Bradbury - because dad had so many of the books at home, both in English and Swedish. It definitely affected me.
900023718344146947 2017-08-22 15:55:50 UTC <MariaHaskins> My dad loved/loves Bradbury. 'The One Who Waits' was the first short story I can remember reading, because my dad was so enthralled with it.
900021790587539457 2017-08-22 15:48:11 UTC <MariaHaskins> @ECthetwit I've read it twice already this morning. I think a Bradbury re-read (Chronicles, maybe?) is in order...  
900021523783745537 2017-08-22 15:47:07 UTC <MariaHaskins> No wonder theres a shadow to Bradburys optimism. Fascism, Bradbury knew, would be alive and well in our century. https://buff.ly/2wkpH6Ppic.twitter.com/4kXfewo3WM

883928379887681537 2017-07-08 05:58:43 UTC <MariaHaskins> @WriterOdell @TheWritingHam & in the end, he LIKES Bilbo. He's just such a terrible person in the movie. He doesn't like Thorin much in the book, but he's not so mean.
883928028367261696 2017-07-08 05:57:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> @WriterOdell @TheWritingHam Just his refusal to help Dale. He helps them right away in the book. He is definitely less "isolationist" than in the movie.
883925399977304068 2017-07-08 05:46:52 UTC <MariaHaskins> @premeesaurus @WriterOdell One of my main "hates" was the change of Thranduil's character. He was so mean and spiteful in the movie. He helps Dale so much in the book.
883918469313564672 2017-07-08 05:19:20 UTC <MariaHaskins> @TheWritingHam I love some of the quieter scenes. In #2, especially the scene when Thorin and Balin enter the mountain again. Great moment.
883917734974803968 2017-07-08 05:16:25 UTC <MariaHaskins> @TheWritingHam Some moments of grace. But yeah, in the third movie they are few and far between.
883917501809258496 2017-07-08 05:15:29 UTC <MariaHaskins> @TheWritingHam Terrible scene in an awful movie. Throughout the movie I kept asking myself: Who the f&&& thought this was a good idea?
883916678173569024 2017-07-08 05:12:13 UTC <MariaHaskins> @TheWritingHam GGnnnngghhhhhh. The third movie is an absolute travesty in so many ways.
883913543053185024 2017-07-08 04:59:45 UTC <MariaHaskins> @NmfBru Definitely a good plan!
883913433372135424 2017-07-08 04:59:19 UTC <MariaHaskins> @premeesaurus By the time those giant rock eating worms appear in the third movie, I'm ready to riot.

883911439563534336 2017-07-08 04:51:24 UTC <MariaHaskins> @premeesaurus My kids are watching the movie and I am raging at the screen in an incoherent manner. A+ parenting.
883910177401049088 2017-07-08 04:46:23 UTC <MariaHaskins> "That was a privilege to witness."  No. Just... no.
883909890330251264 2017-07-08 04:45:14 UTC <MariaHaskins> Yes, I still hate the "healing of Kili" scene in The Hobbit. So much cringing and second-hand embarrassment, omg...
