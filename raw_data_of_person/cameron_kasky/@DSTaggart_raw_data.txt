902761097807179776 2017-08-29 05:13:12 UTC <DSTaggart> @MLBRandomStats Ok fair yeah there are tradeoffs but I feel DRS is a much better representation of defensive value overall.
902760283231461376 2017-08-29 05:09:58 UTC <DSTaggart> @MLBRandomStats bWAR is better overall IMO. Defense component for fangraphs is not nearly as good for one.

892568495740796928 2017-08-01 02:11:27 UTC <DSTaggart> @psaundersdp @playerTBNL It's his best secondary but seems he's lost confidence in it lately. Most his Ks have been on his FB the last few games.
892565854759510016 2017-08-01 02:00:57 UTC <DSTaggart> @psaundersdp did you ask gray about his curve last time out? It was phenomenal. If he has two lethal wipeout pitches look out.

890761368667701248 2017-07-27 02:30:34 UTC <DSTaggart> @JamesSmyth621 @mike_petriello Understandable, but I think K/9 is easier to equate good, i.e >9. What is a comparable K% number?

879570488279744512 2017-06-26 05:22:00 UTC <DSTaggart> @Shapalicious No. Need a Nolan fire to be lit.

879548611456937988 2017-06-26 03:55:04 UTC <DSTaggart> @RFreemyer Yep. Team as a whole is rattled. Need a leader (Nolan) to stand up and change the mindset.
879547842150268928 2017-06-26 03:52:01 UTC <DSTaggart> @TheGhostofMarv @M5Hansen What happened to his run of good form? Back to early season indefensible plate discipline. Growing pains, but why all at the same time?
879546530541191168 2017-06-26 03:46:48 UTC <DSTaggart> @RFreemyer It is easy, especially with his record, but to me Marquez has a better chance at sticking as a starter in the long run.
879546153183756289 2017-06-26 03:45:18 UTC <DSTaggart> @RFreemyer Accurate because this team is better than this and it's disappointing to see them perform at this level. Previous iterations not so much.
879543059637182464 2017-06-26 03:33:01 UTC <DSTaggart> @purpledinocast Staff confidence is plummeting. Was soaring, building off each other. Now trying not to be the next disappointment. Need an Arenado  moment

831706361608052740 2017-02-14 03:27:03 UTC <DSTaggart> @jasoninthehouse are we going to let Russia undermine our Democracy?
831703492771274752 2017-02-14 03:15:39 UTC <DSTaggart> @JordanUhl so sad that the momentum and respect could be washed away in weeks.
831519219539849216 2017-02-14 15:03:25 UTC <DSTaggart> @realDonaldTrump 3rd: are you admitting to a "deal" with Russia?
831519036944977920 2017-02-14 15:02:41 UTC <DSTaggart> @realDonaldTrump 2nd: is this the Scooby Doo villian excuse, you would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids?
831518650750234624 2017-02-14 15:01:09 UTC <DSTaggart> @realDonaldTrump 1st: you don't even have to reference what you are talking about because it is an unmitigated disaster and everyone knows.

829956659405414400 2017-02-09 07:34:22 UTC <DSTaggart> @kennmwilk maybe so. But I was meaning more from a national perspective.
829952957353336832 2017-02-09 07:19:39 UTC <DSTaggart> #ChaffetzTownHall is an example of how urban areas can leverage some power over gerrymandering and voter suppression. This made a difference
829580527246024706 2017-02-08 06:39:45 UTC <DSTaggart> @onlxn yeah but not cool in any way. He has no redeemable qualities.

829175983202635776 2017-02-07 03:52:14 UTC <DSTaggart> @lkherman and they are too proud to have an appropriate person fix it? I can see that.

822606233295319041 2017-01-20 00:46:23 UTC <DSTaggart> @david_j_roth interestingly medical regulations create value, barrier to market. Also important for preventing countless problems, deaths..
822262060314599429 2017-01-19 01:58:46 UTC <DSTaggart> @TylerMaun thank you for being a good dude

784127808121430016 2016-10-06 20:26:52 UTC <DSTaggart> @RFreemyer @hjrrockies I suspect actions, like playing Hundley, were directly counter to Bridich's expectations and both parties were aware.
784125596724932608 2016-10-06 20:18:05 UTC <DSTaggart> @RFreemyer @hjrrockies maybe their relationship was strained because Weiss, the employee, wasn't doing a good job?

763073283050774528 2016-08-09 18:03:42 UTC <DSTaggart> @Mikedecicco but I don't understand the comparison. They are a totally different team. The Ravens won with Trent Dilfer.
763071705543610368 2016-08-09 17:57:26 UTC <DSTaggart> @Mikedecicco oh well I never have. And I like Alex Smith. If he was on Denver's roster there wouldn't be a competition this year.
763071112259350528 2016-08-09 17:55:04 UTC <DSTaggart> @IanStClair @Mikedecicco sorry was winning the super bowl last year not enough proof? Manning was a manager at best last season.

761977746499047424 2016-08-06 17:30:26 UTC <DSTaggart> @IanStClair Alex Smith is good. If Denver had Alex Smith right now there wouldn't be a question about who would start week 1.

761397787560816640 2016-08-04 03:05:53 UTC <DSTaggart> @RockiesZingers I guess with cargo healthy, having Dahl there fills the void very nicely
760864709104939008 2016-08-03 15:47:37 UTC <DSTaggart> @nlckstephens have to think story's injury set some things in motion

755952276653551616 2016-07-20 02:27:22 UTC <DSTaggart> @TopesWriter example of why pitcher wins, and ERA are not always great for evaluating ability. Left game with the score 1-1.

753745446229508096 2016-07-14 00:18:12 UTC <DSTaggart> @RFreemyer skip his next start, or...?
753652786227580928 2016-07-14 18:10:01 UTC <DSTaggart> @RFreemyer Oh, thought he was named in a report but hadn't failed a test. Was that the supposedly anonymous list he was outed from?

750522655346794496 2016-07-05 02:51:59 UTC <DSTaggart> @RockiesZingers I don't think that's a coincidence
746530981591474178 2016-06-24 02:30:30 UTC <DSTaggart> @TopesWriter any theories on why Hoffman is giving up so many deep fly balls, and subsequent home runs lately?
746513875231662080 2016-06-24 01:22:32 UTC <DSTaggart> @MattGross87 seems like that would be distracting to the hitter..
746154441611448320 2016-06-23 01:34:16 UTC <DSTaggart> @ROOTSPORTS_RM #ToyotaTalk Brendan Rodgers crushed a home run estimated at 474 feet!
746040717366071296 2016-06-23 18:02:22 UTC <DSTaggart> @GoYardGoats Dahl getting rest today? Heading to AAABQ?
745448435545870336 2016-06-21 02:48:51 UTC <DSTaggart> @TopesWriter know of any reason Patterson hasn't played the last two? Injury, unlikely call up?
743238207085568000 2016-06-15 00:26:11 UTC <DSTaggart> @GoYardGoats what happened to Senza, did he get injured on the play at second?
740969813795835904 2016-06-09 18:12:24 UTC <DSTaggart> @GoYardGoats are those sharp looking lids available online?
739635121905532928 2016-06-05 01:48:49 UTC <DSTaggart> @TylerMaun @BobbyDeMuro drew hexing the Rockies whenever he possibly can
729424121562464256 2016-05-08 21:33:57 UTC <DSTaggart> @darenw exit velocity on Cargos 5th inning foul ball?
726610597434023936 2016-04-30 03:14:00 UTC <DSTaggart> @BobbyDeMuro any idea why Hoffman didn't start the second game for the topes tonight?
726607500347211776 2016-04-30 03:01:42 UTC <DSTaggart> @ABQTopes I thought Hoffman was slated to start second game?
718916885627019265 2016-04-09 21:41:57 UTC <DSTaggart> @harding_at_mlb hey Thomas, wasn't there supposed to be a Gray rehab start yesterday or today, any word on that?
715696750749614080 2016-03-31 00:26:17 UTC <DSTaggart> @harding_at_mlb any word on Flande? Haven't heard anything recently. He seems to deserve a chance over Rusin or Hale.
706579054808305664 2016-03-06 20:35:48 UTC <DSTaggart> @harding_at_mlb any info on how the "B" game went this morning, particularly anything on Marquez and Senzatela?
