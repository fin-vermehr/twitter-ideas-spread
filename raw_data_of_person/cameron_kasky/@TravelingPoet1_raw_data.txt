909932746889248769 2017-09-18 00:10:47 UTC <TravelingPoet1> @Wikipedia Page should be taken down, if supporting the libelous claim that "Oswald assassinated," when this was NEVER PROVEN IN COURT.
909932376825798656 2017-09-18 00:09:19 UTC <TravelingPoet1> @Wikipedia I would make these edits with adequate legal documentation, but this page is trolled regularly, the CIA/government official story pushed.
909932094607958017 2017-09-18 00:08:11 UTC <TravelingPoet1> @Wikipedia Political committees finding guilt doesn't cut it. No defense for Oswald was allowed at those hearings/committees.

909930989115236352 2017-09-18 00:03:48 UTC <TravelingPoet1> @Wikipedia went back to unconstitutional slander of Oswald as killer WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. #Unfortunatepic.twitter.com/snyP7pGVra
