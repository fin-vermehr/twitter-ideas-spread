972450697097736192 2018-03-10 12:34:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE Exactly! My gender has never even been in question. Ive always known myself the same way. Its my biology thats changed.

972432783913246721 2018-03-10 11:23:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @confirmedturf @RowanQLeigh Yeah, this article seems a bit rhetorically slanted. Tough to judge without knowing this person but its doubtful they are actually transgender but rather a crazy homeless person calling themselves trans. If thats the case, hopefully the law wont support them.

971901090752028672 2018-03-08 00:10:51 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Correct.  It's "transgender woman"   An adjective describing a noun rather than the Orwellian doublespeak word you have invented by shoving two words together.https://twitter.com/DrRadfem/status/971757218717749248

971480677370728449 2018-03-07 20:20:17 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 What I am is much more than a presentation. People don't perceive me as female because I present myself in a certain way, they do because I'm a female bodied person. I could be a nudist and I'd still be the same woman I am.
971477474705051649 2018-03-07 20:07:33 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @BearsRepeating Clever bear.pic.twitter.com/IdpsuJR1DX
971473338819399680 2018-03-07 19:51:07 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 The perception only happens because our bodily sex changes. I'd love it if I were able to conceive too but unfortunately that part of my sex can't be repaired. Sure is nice that the rest of my bodily sex has changed though.
971470552186654720 2018-03-07 19:40:03 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 True, certain parts of biology unfortunately can't be repaired. That doesn't change how we are biologically present in the world due to the great deal of biological change which occurred to our bodily sex, nor does it change how others react to the presence of our biologly.
971466981701554176 2018-03-07 19:25:52 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 All that means is that trans people are incapable of reproduction in their transitioned biological state and aren't susceptible to certain genetically-based diseases. Our biology post transition however very much is dimorphically opposite to our sex pre-transition.
971464032770252800 2018-03-07 19:14:08 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 Do you know how hormone replacement therapy works? It spurs your endocrine system to produce your own natural hormones to produce bodily changes based on genotype. My body knew to develop to become much like my mother's because those genes exist in me to code my proteins.
971460220135395329 2018-03-07 18:58:59 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 We don't choose to be this way any more than anyone chooses to be homosexual. Who we are is simply who we are. It's not an illness, it's an incongruence between brain and body, equally biological pieces of us, which can create psychological distress for some if not addressed.
971459263708192770 2018-03-07 18:55:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 The fact that we're types of human beings who exist as we do as part of our biology. We're born this way and there's no other way for us to exist than to embrace and be who we are.
971456750053462016 2018-03-07 18:45:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 I'm sorry but you do misunderstand. Read the research and judge for yourself but please do at least consider the science and the consensus of the multitude of researchers and doctors who agree with it.  https://www.endocrine.org/advocacy/priorities-and-positions/transgender-health
971454838604169218 2018-03-07 18:37:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 Folks once said the same thing about homosexuality.
971453956202385408 2018-03-07 18:34:06 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 There is a great deal of scientific evidence which demonstrates this fact as well as the experiences any of us trans folk could fill books about.http://journals.aace.com/doi/abs/10.4158/EP14351.RA?code=aace-site
971453674902958080 2018-03-07 18:32:59 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 No, the thing you misunderstand is that the identiy has a biological basis.
971453208731189249 2018-03-07 18:31:08 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @cekbiii The main reason I enjoy it I think is that I can do so many other things while I play it.
971451664770256901 2018-03-07 18:25:00 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @cekbiii If you do get into it, let me know maybe we can play together!
971451574403915778 2018-03-07 18:24:38 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @cekbiii That's almost exactly what my initial experience with it was. I played a few hours, never finished my game and never touched it again until the expansion came out and I started playing with my boyfriend.
971451048895418368 2018-03-07 18:22:33 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Carbon07358418 I don't think it's so much a matter of being correct as just doing what makes you feel right with yourself and allows you to experience life free from distress so that you might best project your presence into the world and enjoy being present as you express yourself to others.

971446505885315072 2018-03-07 18:04:30 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @cekbiii It took me a while to make the leap too. I didn't enjoy it when it first came out but I recently got the expansion and have finally made the leap I think.
971446301014614016 2018-03-07 18:03:41 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Identity is one's concept of self. It is essentially the culmination of our bodily experience and knowledge of who we are and how we exist and are understood by ourselves and others.

971249257855451138 2018-03-06 05:00:42 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadscumTakes @shoe0nhead The point is that our societal circumstances are the same. The pushback trans women receive as we move through the world is equal to cis women. Society functions best when it treats us equally by fully recognizing us as who we are.

971217586267611138 2018-03-06 02:54:51 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw I think the best solution is a shift in the frame through which we view drag. Why should it no longer be a valid form of expression of women are allowed to do it?

971087717332340736 2018-03-06 18:18:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Okay, actually it's a piece by the same artist who did the piece in his tweet comparing trans women in drag to steroid use in the olympics. It wasn't intended to be the trans flag. Still funny to imagine though https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2013/bois-ellsworth-kelly
971085035985080320 2018-03-06 18:08:09 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ I'd like to see drag kings be more celebrated too yes, but I don't think expression as either a queen or king should be restricted to any one sex though.
971083918538665985 2018-03-06 18:03:42 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ I hope that's the case. Not sure if there are any trans men interested in queen culture out there, but if there are, I hope they'll be accepted by the drag community.
971082560250904576 2018-03-06 17:58:18 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ In the future, will there be queens who unironically have XY in their usernames? 
971081447527321600 2018-03-06 17:53:53 UTC <drawnoutofshape> RuPaul attempted to apologize to trans people by posting the trans flag but accidentally googled "trains flag"  #trainspridehttps://twitter.com/RuPaul/status/970810822413795328
971077999905959936 2018-03-06 17:40:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ So what if a butch lesbian wants to be a drag queen? Doesn't she travel an equal distance per what you referred to as a launching point?
971077498531442688 2018-03-06 17:38:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ See, I think it all comes down to how you define the form. My favorite part of all forms of artistic expression is challenges to the form.
971077096440246272 2018-03-06 17:36:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ Did you just compare RuPaul with a TERF?

971065915776389121 2018-03-06 16:52:10 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ I think a change in that frame would make it far more appealing to me.
971065838429245440 2018-03-06 16:51:52 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ Personally, I'd be a lot more interested in watching RuPaul's show if bio queens were allowed to compete. But that's me as an outsider who's never found the show (or queen culture generally) particularly appealing through the frame of it being a male-only form of expression.

971059664539541505 2018-03-06 16:27:20 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ I'm not sure that really matters in any given form of artistic expression. Personal experience and even certainly biology play a part in all forms of art but should those things really preclude anyone from expression generally or participation in artistic competition?
971054597325324288 2018-03-06 16:07:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ The difference is that sport and restroom distinctions are typically made in the spirit of safety and fairness. Not entirely sure what this distinction is in the spirit of.

So for men to do it, its really punk rock, because its a real rejection of masculinity.
971040747788042241 2018-03-06 15:12:09 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Raspberry_Saucy @dchaissejohnsie I've learned this. They're called a lot of things actually. Femme queens, faux queens, bio queens, female queens, etc. RuPaul has declared they aren't allowed to participate in RuPaul's Drag Race.
971036021960953856 2018-03-06 14:53:23 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ Being that males and females are equally capable of masculinity or femininity, both are equally capable of the rejection of one and caricature of the other. Therefore, I don't see why bio queens aren't valid and don't see any reason RuPaul should reject their participation.
971035312343388161 2018-03-06 14:50:34 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ Ru's words:  Drag loses its sense of danger and its sense of irony once its not men doing it, because at its core its a social statement and a big f-you to male-dominated culture.

971032844041670656 2018-03-06 14:40:45 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ I get that, and I think he's in the right to do exactly that. However, I think it's wrong that women (trans and cis alike) are precluded from expressing themselves as queens. Expression of the form is less about sex/sexuality and more about caricature of femininity/masculinity.
971031503152013313 2018-03-06 14:35:25 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @_Vampirate_ Right, though I'm exploring the topic a bit more deeply and pondering on the heart of the question, why are bio queens (trans women fall into this category) precluded from participation in queen culture?
971029482978017282 2018-03-06 14:27:24 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I've got a lot of mixed feelings regarding this recent controversy over @RuPaul's exclusion of women from #RuPaulsDragRace that I'm working out in this piece.

971004037490454528 2018-03-06 12:46:17 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74  I've been reading more about this. I think I'm of the mind that the issue is less about a conflict over a trans women and more that women generally aren't welcomed to participate in queen culture even though both sexes are equally capable of expressing the intent of the form.
970999543734112257 2018-03-06 12:28:26 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ArtistIzzy I'm accused of being a racist, sexist, rapist every other day by someTERForanother.

That's being written about faux queens (not trans women in particular) but I think that attitude would solve the issue. Why even call faux queens faux? They're all royalty IMO.
970992246274347008 2018-03-06 11:59:26 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @dchaissejohnsie @RadFemme74 @Raspberry_Saucy From an article I'm reading:  The answer comes down to the fact that drag is about more than just a man wearing a dress, but about questioning gender stereotypes and the norms we are expected to conform to  norms that can stifle us all  all while putting on a blinding show.
970991428427026432 2018-03-06 11:56:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @dchaissejohnsie @RadFemme74 @Raspberry_Saucy I'd prefer if drag were more accepted as an all-inclusive form of expression. Sex shouldn't matter when anyone is capable of expressing the intent of the form. I think I'd enjoy drag culture so much more if it were more openly inclusive of non-males generally.
970986946238480386 2018-03-06 11:38:22 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @dchaissejohnsie @RadFemme74 @Raspberry_Saucy That's a new term to me :) Sorry, I'm pretty ignorant on queen culture. So is that what we would consider trans women then? Faux Queens? I'm fine with that.
970986032681422849 2018-03-06 11:34:44 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @dchaissejohnsie @RadFemme74 @Raspberry_Saucy If that's the truth of it, I understand completely, but is that the truth of it?? Have cis women historically been involved in drag or similar forms of expression? I've never had the sense that is the case. It's always seemed like an exclusively male form of expression.
970984885761576960 2018-03-06 11:30:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @dchaissejohnsie @RadFemme74 @Raspberry_Saucy As I'm understanding it, in this rare instance, exclusion of trans women is a validating thing because these forms of expression have always been male-only. Excluding trans women from a male form of expression makes sense to me because trans women are women.
970984453567901696 2018-03-06 11:28:28 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @dchaissejohnsie @RadFemme74 @Raspberry_Saucy I can understand the issue better from the perspective of those who are actively involved in drag or similar forms of expression, their careers are on the line. But is it reasonable to expect such a career to continue post-transition when cis women are barred from those careers?
970975948639277056 2018-03-06 10:54:40 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 We're not ready to move on from the old days then? I like to think we are. Inviting trans women to participate in drag feels like an insult to me. If anyone ever suggested I enter a drag race, I would lose my shit.
970967574409248768 2018-03-06 10:21:24 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RuPaul @TheBitchToilet @igott2bme @Jevandt_ I read through this and I still don't get it as a trans woman myself. If cis women aren't allowed to compete in drag races, equality for trans women means also being excluded. What you are saying would make sense if cisgendered females were ever historically welcomed into drag.
970832134939267072 2018-03-05 01:23:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 My logic goes..  Trans women are women   Women aren't allowed to compete in drag races   Trans women aren't allowed to compete in drag races 
970830713900732416 2018-03-05 01:17:34 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 You cant separate drag from trans women? Not sure Im following there. Ive spent most of my life avoiding drag because I dont like being conflated with it as a trans woman. Id rather be separated from drag so what he said comes off as affirming to me.
970828172882317314 2018-03-05 01:07:28 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @_Vampirate_ Come to think of it there's probably a non-zero amount of people who are outraged because they missed the memo and think this was said about trans men.... It's Mack Beggs all over again.
970827957441875970 2018-03-05 01:06:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @_Vampirate_ That sounds pretty reasonable to me. I don't understand why anyone is upset. I could understand outrage if he'd said trans MEN weren't allowed to compete.
970824765077381121 2018-03-05 00:53:55 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Can somebody fill me in on this RuPaul outrage? I don't get it, but I don't know anything about Ru or drag in general. I've always had the sense it's for men only and since cis women (AFAIK) can't compete, why is it a problem that trans women can't?

I'd love to see her write a book focused on trans-related topics. Unfortunately most of what she's had to say directly on the topic has been in various interviews/blog posts.

Lesbians date trans women. Gay men date trans men. Straight men date trans women. Straight women date trans men.

970678400292671488 2018-03-05 15:12:19 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ContraPoints @HeyThisIsRya Yeah, I don't think I could ever regret changing anything about myself to be more like such a wand might have made me.
970659976527142918 2018-03-05 13:59:07 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ContraPoints @HeyThisIsRya I needed to hear this as much as Contra. Ive been tossing around the idea of ffs for years. Thanks for sharing 
970636365938470912 2018-03-05 12:25:17 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JoshBB74 @ronboutwell Not sure Ive heard of someone robbing someone on the street with an 18th century musket 
970634454556381186 2018-03-05 12:17:42 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JoshBB74 @ronboutwell I'm not anti-gun. I'm pro gun control.

970633361839489029 2018-03-05 12:13:21 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JoshBB74 @ronboutwell Thanks for sharing. Not the kind of thing Im advocating for though. Common sense regulations.
970632137983524864 2018-03-05 12:08:29 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JoshBB74 @ronboutwell Where were they before they hit the street? Where were they originally manufactured and how do the weapons move from manufacturer to the streets? Theres a big grey area in there you are ignoring. Do you think criminals are manufacturing their own guns to sell?
970631472133623808 2018-03-05 12:05:51 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @ronboutwell @JoshBB74 Except you can. Ask the many countries which have gotten this problem under control how theyre doing.

970628577967460352 2018-03-05 11:54:21 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @ronboutwell @JoshBB74 Nope, Im for making the jobs of law enforcement officers easier with common sense regulations to the sale of weapons.
970623985535848451 2018-03-05 11:36:06 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @ronboutwell @JoshBB74 No, I just believe the sale should be regulated.   1) Background checks should always be required.   2) Registration should be required.   3) Reporting registered information on lost/stolen weapons should always be required.
970620387276001280 2018-03-05 11:21:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @ronboutwell @JoshBB74 Also a thing which shouldnt be allowed for obvious reasons.

970585000222625792 2018-03-05 09:01:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Here's the best reported data I can find for lost/stolen gun stats. Imagine what these numbers would be like if it actually were required by law to report when guns are lost or stolen.pic.twitter.com/vXtIj1y3AD
970583470996099073 2018-03-05 08:55:06 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @someguyntexas I'm quite sure it's not that simple nor does it have anything to do with political correctness 
970582848553046016 2018-03-05 08:52:38 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @someguyntexas No, not exactly, though that would certainly be included.  My question is more simply how often does a gun that is lost/stolen wind up in the hands of a criminal. That's something I'd like to know but I can't know it because there's no requirement for any such thing. Little data.
970581854486134784 2018-03-05 08:48:41 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @someguyntexas Except how often is a gun lost and stolen that winds up in the hands of a crook or spree-killer? Have you ever considered that?

970577360402690048 2018-03-05 08:30:49 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @ronboutwell @JoshBB74 How do you feel about the fact that it's not required by law in most states to report when a gun is lost or stolen?

970535090848763904 2018-03-04 05:42:51 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Hey @realDonaldTrump was James Mattis out of town that week back in June when you decided to tweet out your policy after "consultation with your Generals and military experts"?https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/02/22/mattis-recommends-keeping-transgender-troops-military-report.html
970328492415049728 2018-03-04 16:01:55 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @BidnessClass It's become a common term used in politics because the far right thought triggering PTSD in leftists who suffer from it was a funny meme and began to target various traumatized minority groups and make fun of those in those groups who lashed out.
970325905087352832 2018-03-04 15:51:38 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @BidnessClass That's fair. If you don't suffer any trauma/PTSD though, please consider that in your thinking when you use terms like #triggered.
970324940078698497 2018-03-04 15:47:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @BidnessClass Thank you for your service.  Have you survived any trauma? Do you suffer any PTSD?
970324349935812614 2018-03-04 15:45:27 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @BidnessClass Are you a vet?
970323240852819974 2018-03-04 15:41:03 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @BidnessClass I am a survivor of trauma, thanks.
970322537799409664 2018-03-04 15:38:15 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @BidnessClass No, but I study trauma and this meme disrespects survivors of trauma.
970320703793885184 2018-03-04 15:30:58 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Wonder if the people using #TriggerALiberalIn4Words know they're disrespecting veterans and others suffering from PTSD  Bet these are the same people who think #TakeAKnee disrespects veterans too.

970065207950237697 2018-03-03 22:35:43 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @MairSaysNo Yeah, I've never once encountered one of them in real life. I feel so bad for anyone who has to deal with them intruding upon their lives on a regular basis.
970061916356964352 2018-03-03 22:22:38 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Trans people who ally yourselves with anti-trans activists, I wish you'd understand that this represents the true goal of their agenda:https://twitter.com/XXRealist/status/970059600299995136

970059547695042560 2018-03-03 22:13:13 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian @RadMacLab "trans woman" is shorthand for "Transgender Woman"  "transwoman" is an adjective and noun shoved together to be used as a pejorative by anti-trans advocates.
970058938682142721 2018-03-03 22:10:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @NoToMisogyny @SmashIdols1776 They aren't. I am a straight trans woman.
970058784252071936 2018-03-03 22:10:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian Gladly. Exactly what we are trying to do. If 'lesbianwomen' can leave trans people alone, that would be great.
970058395448496130 2018-03-03 22:08:38 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @NoToMisogyny Yup, you've got it!   Black women are women.  Tall women are women.  Trans women are women.

970057540766699520 2018-03-03 22:05:15 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian No, lesbians aren't under attack here, lesbianwoman. Misogynists who seek to enslave women to our adjectives using doublespeak are under attack here.
970056958697967616 2018-03-03 22:02:56 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian Stop using doublespeak to enslave women to their adjectives, lesbianwoman.
970055611315605510 2018-03-03 21:57:35 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian Interesting how your Orwellian doublespeak looks racist in a racial context, doesn't it?

970054861164302337 2018-03-03 21:54:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian It's called adjectiveism, lesbianwoman.
970054220274700291 2018-03-03 21:52:03 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian NOBODY can be "transwomen" because that is a word you made up, lesbianwoman.
970053562867900416 2018-03-03 21:49:26 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian "Transwoman" is a made up Orwellian doublespeak word. Literally. It's two words you've shoved together to fit your narrative.  Trans is an adjective.  Imagine calling someone a "blackwoman" or a "fatwoman". Enslavement to adjectives is the social foundation of misogyny.
970052806278369281 2018-03-03 21:46:26 UTC <drawnoutofshape> The preference is the choice in VEHICLE to sexuality, not in sexuality itself.

970052374399193089 2018-03-03 21:44:43 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian Trans women are adult human females.  Trans lesbians are female homosexuals.

970051627989258241 2018-03-03 21:41:45 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian No, it isn't. No one is saying it is.

970050575600627713 2018-03-03 21:37:34 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian If you prefer to not date trans women, that's fine.   Sexuality has two vehicles:  1) Biology  2) Expression  Both are equally valid choices of vehicle to sexuality. Trans advocates are not trying to erase biology. Anti-trans advocates ARE actively trying to erase expression.
970049506304774145 2018-03-03 21:33:19 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @charliekiss @ChloeL001 @natachakennedy @CarlitaRogers @Raspberry_Saucy @mimmymum @Giuliana_London @teresamaryclark @RozKaveney @KJ_Harrison @KateAnderson71 @joss_prior Yeah, exactly, but some studies gatekeep what should be considered a valid "trans" person while others don't, leading to a great deal of statistical confusion.
970049010504478720 2018-03-03 21:31:21 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Whether the vehicle to the choosing of gender and sexuality is biology or expression, both are equally valid choices and nobody has the right to control the linguistic and legal terms of anyone's embodied lives but those individuals themselves.
970049009317482497 2018-03-03 21:31:21 UTC <drawnoutofshape> The right to self-determination of gender and sexuality is more important than the methodology behind the choosing of the vehicle to each. We all have the right to set the linguistic and legal terms of our embodied existences.
970049007778181126 2018-03-03 21:31:20 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Nobody is redefining anything but transphobes when they forcibly attempt to redefine the sexuality of lesbian women who date trans women OR gay men who date trans men OR straight people who date trans people.https://twitter.com/giganticlesbian/status/970047162657660928
970047799780872193 2018-03-03 21:26:32 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian I'm not, I'm including women in lesbianism.   Nobody is redefining anything but you when you forcibly attempt to redefine the sexuality of women who date trans women OR gay men who date trans men OR straight people who date trans people.

970043108737142792 2018-03-03 21:07:54 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RozKaveney @AffordableLeath I can't actually see the comment you're referring to. I think they must have blocked me. Most anti-trans folks have.
970042300779913216 2018-03-03 21:04:41 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RozKaveney @AffordableLeath Yup, I'm a battle hardened advocate for gay/lesbian rights and the crap these people spout is exactly the same crap I heard over and over from anti-gay activists in the 90s.
970041778320609281 2018-03-03 21:02:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> How can a movement which seeks to restructure society in such a way that supports the rights of trans men and women alike be sexist?
970041777091678210 2018-03-03 21:02:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> True sexism is framing the movement for trans rights as a battle between trans women and women while ignoring trans men entirely.

970035457118568449 2018-03-03 20:37:30 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @thelindsayellis I had this exact issue. I quit right around the point I read about Parzival finding the "Coin of Cliche Plot Devices +1" which is so obviously going to give him an extra life or some crap later. I noped out on that page.

970029864597245952 2018-03-03 20:15:16 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Nobody is forcing anyone to express their sexuality with trans people. Women should have the freedom to do so if they wish with their right to self-determination of their own sexuality in tact.

969050320373460993 2018-02-28 03:22:55 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @emkayar6 @LaylaAlexandro Please don't take my criticisms in the other thread the wrong way. I think this is an excellent resource overall and I've barely scratched the surface of it. That's my response for now to what I'm seeing in my surface reading but I have a lot more reading to do here. Thanks again
969049262863671296 2018-02-28 03:18:42 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @emkayar6 I was trying to be smart, but not in a facetious way :) I've been trying my best to become better informed on this concern. I'm an independent thinker and don't ally myself with activists on either side. IMO there's a lot society can do to end these problems w/o segregation.
969046379480911872 2018-02-28 03:07:15 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @emkayar6 @LaylaAlexandro I'm well aware that predatory men are invading women's spaces and attempting to appropriate rights granted to us to themselves. No one would say that doesn't happen but we are just as much (if not more) endangered by such people as any cis women are and no trans person wants that
969044955204333575 2018-02-28 03:01:35 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @emkayar6 @LaylaAlexandro If you follow up, you'll find that most don't succeed in manipulating rights intended to protect us to suit themselves but some do and that is wrong and needs to be addressed. The concept of self-ID should be abolished. We need legitimizing government processes to protect women.
969044796278001664 2018-02-28 03:00:58 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @emkayar6 @LaylaAlexandro There are a few cases with legitimate trans people here. However, the main issue I see here is predatory men who would intrude on women regardless of transgender people who are being allowed to self-ID as trans/women and who attempt to reap the benefits of trans rights.
969037450134900736 2018-02-28 02:31:46 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @emkayar6 It's really not. It's a difficult thing to research. Search engines aren't helpful at all when researching it. I asked politely for sources from those of you who are informed and have been following these incidents closely. Sorry if that offends but please don't snap at me.
969031885878972418 2018-02-28 02:09:39 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @emkayar6 @LaylaAlexandro Thank you :)
969029719332212739 2018-02-28 02:01:03 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @emkayar6 Id like to see sources proving this. If you have any, Id appreciate it if youd provide them. Thanks!

968917912793833482 2018-02-28 18:36:46 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @naefmich Id love to conceive and carry my own child but since I never can, I would like to adopt sooner than later and start a family that way. My own mom is nothing but happy for me and excited to finally be a grandma.
968916313295990787 2018-02-28 18:30:25 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @naefmich Are you implying that I do such things? Ive spent most of my life dreaming of becoming a mother. Id appreciate it if you wouldnt demean, minimize, or erase the value of that just because Im different.

968855855377641473 2018-02-28 14:30:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Indy_Leya 
968855586333974528 2018-02-28 14:29:06 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Indy_Leya I'm doing no such thing. I'm a vocal advocate against things like self-identification. I believe it does more harm than good. I believe in government regulated processes which legitimize transition and protect all women from harm.
968854316181348353 2018-02-28 14:24:04 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Indy_Leya I don't have augmented breasts, I have natural ones which grew per my genotype my mother gave me.
968853091104772101 2018-02-28 14:19:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Indy_Leya Then let's not speak any longer because I'm not interested in conversing with someone who believes something so wildly untrue about me for absolutely no reason.
968850803401412614 2018-02-28 14:10:06 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Indy_Leya When transgender populations are properly supported by governments with legitimizing processes to transitions, the sorts of things you are worried about do not happen because of us. MANY of us exist in my state and we do so harmoniously with full access to all spaces.
968834799459815424 2018-02-28 13:06:30 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @renclithero @RabbitPause @GenderIZbunk I was speaking to this. https://twitter.com/genderizbunk/status/968824228312055809

968830582112374786 2018-02-28 12:49:45 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @renclithero @RabbitPause @GenderIZbunk The inability to stick to the topic at hand and to instead move the goalposts every time a point is made is the only reason there is any incoherence in this discussion.

968824257852727296 2018-02-28 12:24:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @emkayar6 The point is that such people are far from what anyone should consider among their expectations of trans women yet anti-trans people bring it up every day as though it is what is to be expected of us.
968815694795165696 2018-02-28 11:50:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Indy_Leya Thanks again :) I'll do some follow up research on this shortly.
968813937616662528 2018-02-28 11:43:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Indy_Leya I never experienced the socialization you're talking about. Testosterone was interpreted by my brain as a foreign invader. It was poison. Constant sickness and distress which got worse as I grew. I was incapable of living within the range of normal human experience like that.
968811260887396353 2018-02-28 11:32:58 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Indy_Leya If you understood what dysphoria is, you'd understand fully why we're not threats and never could be. If you understood the effects transitioning has on our bodies, that would also help. I'm not only physically female but also mentally incapable of any form of maleness.
968808814224003072 2018-02-28 11:23:15 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Indy_Leya Well there's no point in saying I don't have a male body. Y'all deny reality too hard to have an honest discussion about that fact.
968807928751902721 2018-02-28 11:19:44 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Indy_Leya I am 98% composed of marshmallows, I'm not a threat to anyone and never have been.

One even tried to tell me that my own mother wasn't a woman because she's been through menopause.
968777187137675264 2018-02-28 09:17:35 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @renclithero @RabbitPause @GenderIZbunk @patutiva And how would you feel if someone told you that you had no worth as a woman since you're incapable of that? I'm surprised that's never actually happened to you. That's how it feels for me every time people like you throw this kind of shade at me.

968759573669662722 2018-02-28 08:07:35 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dyketagnan It isnt right that you do. It disgusts me every time I see it. I stand up against this whenever I see it in the trans/rights activist community.
968758809568169985 2018-02-28 08:04:33 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 I always have mixed feelings about this kind of thing. Its just marketing.... but I do like representation 
968757476786163713 2018-02-27 07:59:15 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dyketagnan Know Im repeating myself here but truly its the same for both.
968757273358192640 2018-02-27 07:58:27 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dyketagnan Sexuality and gender both have two vehicles:  1. Biology  2. Expression   Both are equally valid vehicles and both are equally qualified to the right to control the linguistic and legal terms of their embodied lives.

All women who can't conceive are subject to these exact same circumstances. Also, please I'd appreciate it if you don't hold my inability to conceive over me. It's a source of so much pain for me.
968753759051448321 2018-02-27 07:44:29 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RabbitPause @GenderIZbunk @patutiva There's one problem with this line of thinking. Nobody knows I'm trans IRL. I don't receive the sort of pushback visibly trans people do, I live my life entirely as the woman I am.
968753190589157376 2018-02-27 07:42:13 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dyketagnan No, I certainly do, but I don't believe it matters unless someone is going to see it or be intimate with that particular person.
968752669832699909 2018-02-27 07:40:09 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dyketagnan Sexuality has two vehicles:  1) Biology  2) Expression  Both vehicles are perfectly valid ways to determine one's sexuality.

968752040750051328 2018-02-27 07:37:39 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dyketagnan For the second type, it isn't much about sex at all but rather is about being able to be ourselves by overcoming the body/mind incongruence which prevents us from living normal lives pre-transition.
968751526759018496 2018-02-27 07:35:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dyketagnan Sure. One dresses as a woman for fun/kinks on the weekends with the intent of being on display/sexualized. The other is dedicated to transitioning in order to live fully realized lives in which we most often prefer to be invisible and just want to be left alone.

968749816145764353 2018-02-27 07:28:49 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @renclithero @RabbitPause @GenderIZbunk And what does having a genotypically driven female body type which developed naturally as my endocrine system began to produce more of my body's own natural estrogen make me?

Perhaps those stats are similar because trans people are at risk for these circumstances

968671464034619393 2018-02-27 02:17:28 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @GenderIZbunk Most of us never experience male socialization. In my case, I've never been male. Pre-transition, I was neither male nor female but a developmentally stunted freak who was incapable of living within the range of normal human experience. Transition has allowed me that.

Those who need it deserve it to be available. I agree that it shouldn't be encouraged or pushed, but it should be available and supported by society for those who need it.

968127225534078981 2018-02-26 14:14:52 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ValuInvstrToday Probably not, but thats not what I want. Id like a lot of common sense regulations is all. Like requiring it by law to report any time a gun is lost or stolen.

968027281234022400 2018-02-25 07:37:43 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @porridgehead2 In the comments I was responding to, I never had the sense you were talking about children. Seems to me that you're discussing dysphoria generally and transition's role in addressing it.
968026984931610624 2018-02-25 07:36:32 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @porridgehead2 I'm not saying that either. I'm of the mind that most kids shouldn't be encouraged to transition. Instead, they should wait until at least 18. In the most extreme circumstances such as my own however, certain measures should be allowed.
968024551883005953 2018-02-25 07:26:52 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RabbitPause @porridgehead2 What are your qualifications?

I've only mentioned my family/community because they were the reason I tried EVERYTHING else before transitioning. The point of my post is that nothing else is a viable option for people like myself. If it were, I'd know.

968021013878530049 2018-02-25 07:12:49 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ValuInvstrToday >Weapons of war have been outlawed since 1986.   Which means "certain arms have been outlawed since 1986". Private citizens lost the ability to protect themselves from the government when this happened, making this an invalid #SecondAmendment argument in the modern age.
968020526039027712 2018-02-25 07:10:53 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ValuInvstrToday The M16, the assault rifle most commonly used by the US army is an AR-15 that has been modified to repeat.
968019217059602432 2018-02-25 07:05:40 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ValuInvstrToday Supporting a delusional idea about the second amendment and laws which allow the continued unchecked sale of weapons of war that are killing our kids makes you part of the problem.
968017475832045568 2018-02-25 06:58:45 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ValuInvstrToday Of course they do because they are our overlords and want you to believe that you have been granted something special to protect yourself. The truth is that you've lined their pockets with gold and own a useless hunk of steel.
968016173509087232 2018-02-25 06:53:35 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Seriously, if you're still under the delusion that #SecondAmendment is designed for private citizens to have the ability to keep the government in check, you need to re-evaluate your worldview. Your AR-15 is a bulky pea-shooter that's only good for shooting up schools.

They think I am implying that "genital preferences" mean sexuality is a choice and that's not what I mean. The choice is about the VEHICLE to sexuality, be it through biology or expression. Both are valid IMO.
967977632133517312 2018-02-25 04:20:26 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Shapiro denies the empirical reality that speaking from experience and bringing personal perspective to discussions is the only way to approach a discussion with pure motives.

There's no shame in just not having an opinion on something. In fact, I see that as a sign of strength in people if they can admit that. You used the term "body dysphoria" which illustrates you are clueless.
967916215132983296 2018-02-25 00:16:23 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RabbitPause @porridgehead2 You should really not talk about things you don't understand. Where did you get that idea from? @benshapiro?
967915973595590656 2018-02-25 00:15:25 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Transitioning for Gender Dysphoria is the best option. Take it from me, I'm from Mike Pence's home town and my family/community is as traditional as you might imagine. I tried EVERYTHING before transitioning over fear of losing my family. Nothing worked.

967567620055687168 2018-02-24 01:11:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @phyphor You'd think it would speak volumes that trans women lose in competition to other women all the time (though media never covers it because the world is full of sexists and transphobes) but trans men who are forced to compete with women invariably have perfect records.
967564485488758784 2018-02-24 00:58:44 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I'm tired of seeing this happen again and again.   Stop forcing girls to compete with males.http://www.wfaa.com/news/transgender-wrestler-from-euless-trinity-booed-after-winning-state-semifinal/522879497

We've been a part of our communities in my state for a very long time. Everything has been handled appropriately by my government and trans women haven't caused any other type of woman any problems here.
967422482922790914 2018-02-24 15:34:28 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Most importantly, trans-inclusive laws and regulations don't actually hurt women when properly handled by a government. If anyone pretending to be a woman to abuse us is supported by any government's trans-inclusive laws, those laws need to be changed to protect all women.https://twitter.com/RadFemme74/status/967419722701697024

This grew through actions we took together to become so much more. Today, my hometown has become one of the most accepting of LGBT in the state.

967304936060018688 2018-02-23 07:47:23 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @lileuthanasia Hey don't be mean :/ It isn't best for everyone. I've known plenty of people who don't pass terribly well who are very happy post-transition.
967304324987670528 2018-02-23 07:44:57 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @MoonstoneMarie4 I'm sorry if I came off like a twat waffle @BenjaminMHughe1
967301857885478913 2018-02-23 07:35:09 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @MoonstoneMarie4 It forces me to be cautious, and my defensiveness is only that. Caution.
967301726092124160 2018-02-23 07:34:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @MoonstoneMarie4 Please don't judge. You really don't know how I feel or what my motivations in this are. People who de-transition are incredibly interesting people and I love getting to know them and hearing their stories but a lot of people lie about it on the internet.
967300985524768775 2018-02-23 07:31:41 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I'd like to have coffee with you some time then :) I'm from Indiana, it's an actual possibility.
967300292487335936 2018-02-23 07:28:55 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I still don't entirely believe you. You could easily have found someone's timeline and documentation pictures online and set that as your name on twitter. Again, what was the condition you were diagnosed with called and also may I ask who was your doctor?
967299683747024898 2018-02-23 07:26:30 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Thanks for providing all this, I'm a bit more inclined to believe you now. What makes you believe that either it isn't real or that there's some conspiracy going on to trick people into transition just because it wasn't right for you? It is absolutely real and helps many so much.
967296442539921408 2018-02-23 07:13:38 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I'm so defensive because I believe you are lying about your life experiences and I would like to confirm the truth behind them before engaging with you further.
967295350871592960 2018-02-23 07:09:17 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Young children investigate science the same way as I did, by talking to doctors with their parents.

967293430564040704 2018-02-23 07:01:39 UTC <drawnoutofshape> What is the condition with which you were diagnosed called and were you diagnosed with any peripheral conditions?

967049486970302464 2018-02-23 14:52:19 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @dinahbrand2 To simplify that since it may have been hard to follow:  There's no hardline answer to this. With some prisoners in some prisons, integration will be best. For others in other scenarios, alternatives might work better. It's always going to depend on scenario and circumstance.
967048190804594689 2018-02-23 14:47:10 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @dinahbrand2 That's not my assumption. My assumption is that those who are running the prisons will handle the management of their prisoners in the way that best creates conflict-free circumstances among inmates and that all integration/segregation will be handled case by case per merit.
967046229770285057 2018-02-23 14:39:22 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ArtistIzzy With me, from about puberty onward, it was never not like an out-of-body experience. I was hyper-aware of it and I couldn't function, dropped out of school ~8th grade. Tried everything short of electroshock therapy to deal with it but nothing worked 'til HRT. Life's great now 
967043262145089539 2018-02-23 14:27:35 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ArtistIzzy The experience is a bit different for everyone. For me, dysphoria nagged at me from as early as I could think and form memories, so I never considered myself male and I couldn't fully realize myself as female either so I just stopped existing and became a ghost.

I'm a survivor myself and have spent a great deal of my time with other survivors. No one has ever expressed anything but empathy for me and in fact I'd not have ever overcome any of it if those women hadn't been there for me.
967033180116090880 2018-02-23 13:47:31 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @issagaro @cwknews @RadFemme74 Me too, I wish I'd started HRT so much earlier but thankfully I didn't wait too long. I'd still give most anything to have the years of my life that I denied myself back.

967027955787591681 2018-02-23 13:26:45 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ArtistIzzy Me: Yes, please!   Also me: Do whatever you want 
967018687482990594 2018-02-23 12:49:56 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @CuriousNesska @ArtistIzzy Yeah, straight up vegetable dishes are delicious. I don't miss meat in the slightest and it's been so good for me. As long as you don't hate proteins like beans/tofu/mushrooms/rice/seitan/tempeh it's a great time.
967017496950853632 2018-02-23 12:45:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @CuriousNesska @ArtistIzzy I used to do keto but I couldn't ever do it long term :(  About a year ago though, I became a vegetarian that that's been life altering. Weight has been slowly but surely melting off me and I don't have to try all that hard, it's way easier than I thought to be a herbivore.

967008874648793088 2018-02-23 12:10:56 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @issagaro @cwknews @RadFemme74 Yup, exactly the same. and I pray none of my childhood recordings ever surface on the internet D: I was also regularly mistaken for a girl by strangers up until about 6-7ish.

Things my family have described about me before that age give every indication I've always known.

Even if they lash at you first, just turn the other cheek and take it. Ignore it. Just talk, be reasonable, and respect their concerns as you engage with them.

If a lesbian doesnt view trans women as women thats their prerogative and theyre free to deny trans women sexually on those grounds but that doesnt give the right to force that view onto either the trans woman herself or anyone whod date her.
966340455901298688 2018-02-21 15:54:53 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I wonder how those who feel trans women are men view the fact that I would be arrested if I walked around topless in my town?   That doesn't happen to men.

The lesbians who date trans women are very much still lesbians and absolutely have the rights to the linguistic and legal terms of their embodied lives and you can't control them.

It was about emotional connections to my own experience of my own body and the world.  Also, I'm straight, and fucking hate mirrors and pictures of myself. If anything, I could use a bit of narcissism in my life.

Dysphoria's not classified as a developmental disorder but it should be. Can't say I experienced the world as a woman, just as developmentally stunted, with a hermaphroditic condition I've corrected to get poison out of my body.

My disagreement does not mean I am in denial, I was very much early-onset as I've written about extensively in my blog. I just believe autogynephilia should be re-thought within new societal frameworks.

Typically those who exhibit signs of it have adhere to perverted/fetishistic private lives and tend to over-sexualize all thinking about homosexuals.

When repressed homosexuals come to terms with themselves, we don't pathologize them differently. Why do so to late-onset trans people?

The thing about late-onset is that it always develops through confusion and repression due to lacking pathways to self understanding. The world's changing, we're going to see less of this.

965904963326144512 2018-02-20 11:04:23 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Rruairi It absolutely is okay to be a feminine man or a masculine woman. The choice nurture and express either in oneself should be equally celebrated in both genders. Dysphoria, however, is not about expression of femininity or masculinity but bodily comfort and personal autonomy.
965901852503085056 2018-02-20 10:52:01 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Rruairi I don't date women.
965899974725787648 2018-02-20 10:44:34 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Rruairi Um.. First of all, less than 1% of trans women would ever do such a thing. The vast majority of us would find it mortifying. Second, undergoing hormone replacement therapy halts the production of gametes.
965894172686340097 2018-02-20 10:21:30 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @giganticlesbian @second_sasha Not even 14%.   This is an American poll, so the majority of the 14% is our lovely anti-LGBT religious community.

965888039179386880 2018-02-20 09:57:08 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Rruairi That's not true, and it is cruel to the lesbians who date trans women to rob them of their sexuality because you have an opinion which differs from theirs regarding transgender people.

There's nothing even remotely shocking about the other two screencaps. One states an unrelated fact and the other is differential diagnosis.

Haven't heard much about any trans men in sports, but I don't follow sports much at all.   I imagine the shade thrown at them is some kind of comparison to steroid use or some nonsense like that.
965612923954630656 2018-02-19 15:43:55 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Nimue_B @grushenka The only reason I can see to not allow it would be if competitors themselves object. If there's no objection, why not allow trans-inclusive competitions? If there is objection, it should absolutely be considered ,as it should for any perceived unfairness in sports.
965612033168302081 2018-02-19 15:40:23 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Nimue_B @grushenka That's fair when it comes to men, though keep in mind the effects for HRT for transwomen and also that sports are rarely segregated purely by sex, but also differing weight/strength/speed classes and if judges can discern no verifiable physiological advantage, why not allow it?

965550310767910912 2018-02-19 11:35:07 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Nimue_B @grushenka I'd also like to invite you to read this study on the biology/physiology of transgender people in relation to sports. Understanding the science supporting the decision to invite trans women into sports may be comforting to some of your concerns:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/

965547828478205953 2018-02-19 11:25:15 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @grushenka @Nimue_B Exactly. The one thing that upsets me more than anything on the topic of trans people in sports is that there's always an uproar every time trans women win, but never a peep when we lose. It's simultaneously sexist and transphobic and it disgusts me.
965544988334526464 2018-02-19 11:13:58 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Nimue_B @grushenka With sports more specifically, I feel it's best left to the competitors and judges to decide whether or not integration should be allowed. No one should be forced to compete with trans women, but if they choose to, more power to them.
965544480039473152 2018-02-19 11:11:57 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Nimue_B @grushenka When it comes to statistics and sports, I do understand your concerns also and feel there is validity to them. For example, I don't believe a man who became a CEO and then transitioned should be counted statistically among "female CEOs" by any means.
965543600636379136 2018-02-19 11:08:27 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Nimue_B @grushenka And more women are fighting for them today. I'm in agreement with you when it comes to self-ID. That's dangerous to both us and natal women alike. However, I firmly believe women should be among women in public spaces. Predatory men are our common enemy. Let's keep them out.
965542380307959808 2018-02-19 11:03:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J @Raspberry_Saucy @RadFemme74 @Karen_McInnes Except it does. In your eyes and everyone else's. Rapists, sexists, and misogynists share this experience and we are equally subject to their attacks. All of my movements through the world receive the exact same pushback from those who would abuse/oppress us.
965540529411903488 2018-02-19 10:56:15 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Nimue_B @grushenka Males aren't female. Woman means exactly what we've talked about here. Trans inclusion does not change any of this and no such discussion needs to take place if an understanding that trans women aren't men is established.
965535855661199360 2018-02-19 10:37:41 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @grushenka @Nimue_B I don't know what to do about them either other than exactly as you said, challenge them as I see them. They've caused so much damage to trans people. It's so sad because we're such a hopeless minority and we NEED allies, but I never wanted cultural trash to speak for me.

Males don't have much need for such a sense. Instead, their senses are geared toward breaking/penetrating boundaries.

In my formerly incongruent state of being, I was hermaphroditic. Post-transition, I am still, but to a degree which leaves me moving through the world within the range of normal female human experience.
965494218155229184 2018-02-18 07:52:14 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dyketagnan My actual point is to say that trans people share biological features and societal circumstance with natal people and that for many, these features are more important to expression of sexuality in relationships than anything to do with genitalia or reproductive capacity.
965493219462209536 2018-02-18 07:48:16 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dyketagnan No, I'm not dancing around anything and this has nothing to do with my point but I will address it anyway. We are biologically hermaphroditic and when necessary, we transition from this incongruent, hermaphroditic state to live our lives as fully realized men or women.
965491108955459585 2018-02-18 07:39:52 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Skepticat_UK @Super_Freak_J @RadFemme74 @grushenka of sex or a more fluid sense of gender, is less important than the right to be free to live it out, without discrimination, harassment, injury, pathologization or criminalization  and with full institutional and community support."

So whether one wants to be free to live out a hard-wired sense

I'm with Judith Butler on this, the right to self-determination itself is more important than the methodology behind it. We all should have the right to control the terms of our lives and sexuality.
965489181052100609 2018-02-18 07:32:13 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dyketagnan If you knew anything about me and weren't just making biased assumptions about me, you would know that I do accept this. However, it's less about "biological sex" than it is about "biological features" such as genitalia/reproductive capability.

Please read the blog post I linked you earlier entitled "Dedication & Identification" which delves deeply into this issue and ultimately capitulates to this concern with the belief that self-ID harms all women, trans and natal alike

If we lived in a world with no gender stereotypes whatsoever, dysphoria would still be just as real. My life may have been a bit easier, but I still would have transitioned.

965480527577968640 2018-02-18 06:57:50 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @grushenka My commentary on feminism is unrelated to my commentary on dysphoric people. I'd appreciate it if you would not take my arguments out of context. Thank you.

At puberty, when my body's misaligned hormones mutated me, I became unable to exist until that poison was removed from my body.

It has been a sensual experience with my brain responding to both internal and external stimuli within the range of females and outside the range of males.

965453695155568641 2018-02-18 05:11:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J Or do you really suffer from psychosis? Yes. You have lost contact with external reality and turn what is internal to you external, with the firm belief that you speak for all women because no one could possibly disagree with you.
965452800426696704 2018-02-18 05:07:39 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Skepticat_UK @grushenka @Super_Freak_J No, we can, you just continually reject everything we say and shout "LA LA LA LA LA" then tell us we're men again, all the while never able answer the question of what makes us men and not women yourself.
965451708544503808 2018-02-18 05:03:19 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J You exhibit the definition of psychosis by continually denying reality and forcing your beliefs into the mouths of women and lesbians who are not you as though your opinions were their opinions. I hope that you can find your way back to reality some day.

965449413677154306 2018-02-18 04:54:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J Do you find this man attractive?pic.twitter.com/CGH5gD7KeA
965449026270310402 2018-02-18 04:52:39 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J The fatal flaw in this thinking is you believe in your delusions that you speak for all women and lesbians when this is simply not true. Many homosexual are attracted to both trans men and women alike. Are you attracted to trans men?
965447254604701703 2018-02-18 04:45:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J The bully comment was in reference to the natal female lesbians who you just said are not actually lesbians. Your misguided opinions do not invalidate these womens' sexuality.
965446509285269504 2018-02-18 04:42:39 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J Trans women can be lesbians.  Trans women can be straight.  Trans women can be bisexual.  Trans women can be pansexual.  Trans women can be demisexual.  Trans women can be sapiosexual.  Trans women can be asexual.
965445572822958081 2018-02-18 04:38:56 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J Why do you equate "trans women can be lesbians" with "all lesbians must have sex with trans women"? The logic there is baffling.
965445080361373696 2018-02-18 04:36:58 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Skepticat_UK @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J My arguments here aren't about "forcing lesbians to have sex with trans women" they're about uplifting downtrodden women who have had either their womanhood or sexuality spurned by bullies.
965444642283147265 2018-02-18 04:35:14 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Skepticat_UK @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J I've never once said you have to do anything. Biological preferences to sexuality are perfectly valid. As a straight woman, I don't hold anything against any men who would rather not engage with me on the basis that they want children. Why should I discriminate your own choice?
965441950626312192 2018-02-18 04:24:32 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Skepticat_UK @grushenka @Super_Freak_J It was referred to Gender Identity Disorder per an entry in the DSM written 30+ years ago. Science has since discovered objective truths and understandings about dysphoria which has prompted GID to antiquity and removal from the DSM where it has been replaced by Gender Dysphoria.

It's relative to mental illness in that living in dysphoric states can create psychological distress, leading to mental disorders. It's not mental in and of itself though.
965430360556343296 2018-02-18 03:38:29 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I'm sorry, did I stutter and say "gender identity" when I was talking about the central nervous system?https://twitter.com/grushenka/status/965429940584775681

What you're about to tell me is something like, "women who have sex with trans women are not lesbians".   Think about how offensive this is before you say it.

Im not trying to change definitions, Ive only made the point that I fit the definition which a woman provided me.

965407111009243136 2018-02-18 02:06:06 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Skepticat_UK The fact of the matter is that you do not speak for everyone and your opinion is far from representative of global understanding. To believe this is the definition of narcissistic psychosis.

965401282830917633 2018-02-18 01:42:56 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J @RadFemme74 Hey @ghostvagabond, @Skepticat_UK says you are despicable, vile, and a coward who would like you to unblock her so she can respond to you herself but I would understand if you dont want to unblock someone who is being so rude to you.
965400607891828736 2018-02-18 01:40:15 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J @RadFemme74 @Skepticat_UK A more accurate definition of woman is a type of adult human being who shares biological features and societal circumstance with those of female kind. Natal abnormalities, developmental conditions, and reproductive inability do not preclude one from womanhood.
965398635264520192 2018-02-18 01:32:25 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J @RadFemme74 @Skepticat_UK Yes, unfortunately. My grandpa was that way. Some of my earliest memories are of his horrendous racism and sexism. I loved him as family tends to do but honestly the world is a better place now that hes gone. This kind of thinking is slowly but surely fading from society.
965397335734878209 2018-02-18 01:27:15 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Skepticat_UK @Super_Freak_J Nobody is appropriating your sexuality. Especially not me, Im straight. @RadFemme74 and those like her have their own sexuality which they have arrived at through their experience of their biology as it relates to sexual interest in others.
965395784903643143 2018-02-18 01:21:05 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Skepticat_UK The definition adult human female refers back to the adjective use @Super_Freak_J referenced earlier, which it is claimed precludes trans women from womanhood because we do not produce ova. I do not believe this claim. Much more than ova production defines us as women.
965394238879031296 2018-02-18 01:14:57 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J @Skepticat_UK You are trying to vilify me. I also stand up for women/girls. I do everything I can to uplift those in my state and community and am an intersectional feminist who fights for the safety and protection of all of us worldwide with all the energy I can spare, which is never enough.

And what of the natal females who cant conceive and dont fit your definition?
965391064768172032 2018-02-18 01:02:20 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J @Skepticat_UK The fact you believe that is what people like myself and @RadFemme74 are doing is absurd. We are just trying to be ourselves and live comfortably as who we are, its really not any more complicated. We are sisters and none of your attempts to vilify me will change that.

I have provided scientific research and objective reasoning to my claims. You on the other hand have done nothing but lash out and tell me Im wrong with no sources or reasoning provided.
965386907709472768 2018-02-18 00:45:49 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J Treatments to the brain have proven ineffective in the majority of dysphoric cases, while treatments to the body have been proven greatly effective. I support either pathway to healing, but in cases such as my own, only bodily treatments are viable.
965385896634802177 2018-02-18 00:41:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J My central nervous system (which believe it or not is biological) functions perfectly normally and my mind works just fine, thanks. Dysphoric people have a biological incongruity. Neither then brain nor the body is wrong, they are the way they are.

965383859775967232 2018-02-18 00:33:42 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J To correct a biological deformity which is a burden on womanhood and end the incongruity which exists between our bodies and central nervous systems in order to begin to living within the range of female human experience, allowing us to overcome distress and lead normal lives.
965382361386012672 2018-02-18 00:27:45 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J So then according to your definition, no woman who is incapable of conception is a woman. Is this true?
965381211383361540 2018-02-18 00:23:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @unbreakablepenn @Danproctor13 @AraBaralo No, I have many better sources to support points such as that. Read the context of the articles I posted. This conversation is focused on genetics and biological/developmental abnormalities and that is what my linked articles pertain to.
965380560808968193 2018-02-18 00:20:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J You dont seem to understand what it means to be an adult human female. How often is it that your genitals are used in identifying you and why do you think genitals and diseases are all women are?
965379116932521984 2018-02-18 00:14:52 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J Opinions are not facts. Facts are objective, you have given no objective substance to your argument and thus it remains opinion.
965378372992995329 2018-02-18 00:11:54 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Super_Freak_J Ive explained how I and @RadFemme74 are female. How about now you explain how we are male?
965377761685667840 2018-02-18 00:09:28 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J Developmentally of course we are stunted, as is the nature of developmental disorders, but post-transition nothing separates us from being female but an ability to conceive and to contract certain diseases. Fertility and diseases do not define women.
965376729136103425 2018-02-18 00:05:22 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J We develop on a psychosocial level and experience ourselves as such on a biophysical level, which causes us to form emotional attachments to the experiences of our bodies and development in the world as women. Post-transition we share biology and sociocultural circumstance also.

965361131870216192 2018-02-18 23:03:24 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J This doesnt explain anything, youve just reiterated your opinion.
965243158715084800 2018-02-18 15:14:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J First of all, this definition explains a single adjective usage of the word female and there are many others. Secondly, she does very much fit this definition. Can you explain how she is not of the female sex?
965241504322281472 2018-02-18 15:08:02 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ElleWest25 @notCursedE Yeah, that's how it's used in the example I'll have to ask my gay friends if there's an actual gay equivalent to proto-lesbian since this punny term obviously isn't it.

Dysphoric people are developmentally and socially stunted and HRT can help us overcome that. Also, as I experienced life pre-transition, testosterone made me feel sick 24/7 which also lended to spoiling my life. Thankfully, I got rid of that poison.
965232465697787905 2018-02-18 14:32:07 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour @Matimamich @LEVETLEIGH Of course not. I don't think anything like that will be possible in my lifetime and may not even be possible at all. It would make me happy if it were, but I've made peace with it. I'd like to adopt some day though, I hope someone like yourself wouldn't stand in the way of that.

It takes about 3 years to complete the process. I doubt she will offend your senses at all after some time.

How much power/responsibility does a position like that carry? Things are so different in the US, I could elect myself to a local office with that many votes but I'd be a meaningless speck to the govt as a whole.
965227554369146885 2018-02-18 14:12:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @RadFemme74 @Super_Freak_J You're not making sense to me, could you explain? What makes her male? Also, what makes her not female?

Also forgive me but I know next to nothing about the UK government. How important is the position and how does moving into it work? Some kind of election like in the US?
965225166748966912 2018-02-18 14:03:07 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour @LEVETLEIGH @Matimamich Why do you think that's true? My friend has actually offered me her own if anything like that ever becomes possible. I want kids and she knows she doesn't. She said she would enjoy the sexual freedom without worry for pregnancy and would rather never deal with a period again.
965223993497309184 2018-02-18 13:58:27 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour @Matimamich @LEVETLEIGH I'd like to hear more about the political points. I have noticed a common problem among a lot of trans people/activists of disparaging those who disagree. I don't like that sort of attitude or approach to things, I think everyone's opinion is important and should be heard.
965222921772945408 2018-02-18 13:54:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour @Matimamich @LEVETLEIGH My inability to conceive is something that pains me deeply as a woman, so I can relate. Many women have the ability and don't want it, I could see a transplant like that being beneficial to both parties if it were possible. I'm sorry, I can't see that as offensive.

You are reducing the Central Nervous System which controls every conscience and unconscious function of your being to imagination and feelings. Dysphoria has biological and physiological underpinnings which cause incongruences between CNS and body.

965059002274144256 2018-02-17 03:02:50 UTC <drawnoutofshape> All men and women are valid in spite of anatomical standards.

965056793637457920 2018-02-17 02:54:04 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Danproctor13 So trans men are men and trans women are women? Dysphoria is among the anomalies you have identified as exceptions to the rule.

964890258902044672 2018-02-17 15:52:19 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Danproctor13 I do agree.  The statement  "Male genotype/phenotype: XY/penis Female genotype/phenotype: XX/vagina"  is proven false by the statement  "Medical anomalies aside I am correct."  You have acknowledged that medical anomalies such as mine are adequate for re-signification of terms.

964456217111384064 2018-02-16 11:07:35 UTC <drawnoutofshape> They are not boys. They are girls you are condemning to miserable existences for looking different. Girls who mean no harm and are just trying to be themselves and express themselves as best suits who they are. Your effort to wrest linguistic control from their lives is telling.https://twitter.com/OldmanOfTheWeb/status/964451990435778561
964454686362423297 2018-02-16 11:01:30 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @OldmanOfTheWeb Right. Girls are uncomfortable sharing toilets, dormitories, and showers with boys, which is why no girl, in spite of the adjectives describing her, should be forced to do any such thing.  And rightly so.  As a survivor of sexual assault, I speak from experience.
964452940474961921 2018-02-16 10:54:34 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @OldmanOfTheWeb >It's very well researched.  Serious question, have you looked at the sources this is compiled from?

964446267526057987 2018-02-16 10:28:03 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @OldmanOfTheWeb You can see evidence of this fact in examining the words being used in the term. Trans is not a noun. Trans is not something one can identify as it is not a Person, Place, or Thing. Trans is an adjective. Adjectives are descriptive words which modify the states of nouns.
964445351313887232 2018-02-16 10:24:24 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @OldmanOfTheWeb The term "trans-identified" is used only by transphobes in an Orwellian attempt to revoke our right to self-determination and wrest linguistic control over our own lives away from us.

964441633310703616 2018-02-16 10:09:38 UTC <drawnoutofshape> It wasn't all bad, of course. I had some great conversations. @DrRadfem even retweeted my call to action, which was way more attention than any TRA gave the post. But the radfem majority's response was to crucify me, over and over again.
964440578581647360 2018-02-16 10:05:27 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Most of these comments were in response to a post I made after my neighbor was assaulted. I suffered secondary trauma and in self-therapy, set out to build bridges between radfems/trans people and advocate for both sides working together to improve shelter spaces.
964439191152050177 2018-02-16 09:59:56 UTC <drawnoutofshape> We have a word for those who are afraid of trans people on the basis that they have chosen to reject the validity of our experience and resulting self-determination and choose instead to believe wild ideas proclaiming us harmful/dangerous.

964437029609136129 2018-02-16 09:51:20 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @OldmanOfTheWeb Yes it is.

The entirety of the transphobic fear mongering in this article is predicated on the idea that domperidone harms infants.

963424834880442368 2018-02-13 14:49:14 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE That's true, though I think homo-inclinations are also evolution to meet a different kinds of survival needs. When it comes to the monogamy question, I think there's advantages to both which may change over time. We're not really built for either, it's all about circumstance.
963420378981953536 2018-02-13 14:31:32 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE Thanks for the thoughtful response That's an interesting idea, you might be right. I'm not sure that doing whatever is best for all humans in terms of survival though. The polarization can help some of us attract one another and pair off to some degree.
963414757285023744 2018-02-13 14:09:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE People like to say the same about gender. Not sure I believe that argument, but yours I definitely do. What would you say compels you to remain that *guy* in that statement instead of something like that person?

963213685941526528 2018-02-12 00:50:13 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw Ah, okay, that's more in line with my thinking. Thanks for the clarification!
963208325902032901 2018-02-12 00:28:55 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw I really don't understand how anyone can think self-ID is a good idea. It's clearly a step too far in the wrong direction. I'm not at all sure why you would focus your efforts on logistically impossible spaces instead of fighting the cause of the problems with integration.
963205886536830976 2018-02-12 00:19:13 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw I'd say something like maybe an LGBTQ wing might be more appropriate, though that's not likely to be much safer than full integration with non-trans people.
963204286057467905 2018-02-12 00:12:51 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw There's a problem inherent to this idea I'd like you to consider. Social support structures are a necessary element to transition and to rehabilitation in prison. These collapsing is responsible for most trans suicide. Segregating trans people entirely would force a collapse.

962978412691443712 2018-02-12 09:15:19 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @SwissKLA I don't fault you for that inference, I can see how you might draw that meaning from what I said but truly that's not what I meant at all. I wish I had chosen to word that better. I'm sorry for the confusion.
962977655174959104 2018-02-12 09:12:18 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @SwissKLA My words would imply that if my words said, "Women who wish to compete with trans women should be celebrated over women who choose not to." This is not what my words said, and that's not the meaning they implied. That's the meaning you've inferred.
962975378372411392 2018-02-12 09:03:16 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @SwissKLA I don't appreciate having words put into either my mouth or the mouths of female competitors. Nothing I said was intended to place any value judgement on to those who wish to compete with trans women or those who wish not to.
962972765287518208 2018-02-12 08:52:53 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @SwissKLA In the first half of my life, they weren't. In the second half, they are. Every movement I make in the world is interpreted by others as a woman's movement. I'm reacted to exactly the same as all women. I'm subject to the same pushback from the world in all of my movements.
962971837088059392 2018-02-12 08:49:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @SwissKLA No? I very much do see a problem with it, which is why I've said it is best to leave the decisions to participate in such competitions to the women who will be participating.
962970419878924288 2018-02-12 08:43:33 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @SwissKLA I grew up with a developmental disorder. I've been psychologically and socially stunted by this disorder. Half of my life was outside normal range of female human experience. The other half has been spent sharing biology and societal circumstance with those of my kind.
962967025927774209 2018-02-12 08:30:04 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @SwissKLA You didn't even read my comment on sports, did you?  "trans inclusion in sports should be left to judges and competitors to decide on."  This means that if women don't want to compete with trans women, they should never have to. It should be left to their choice, not ours.
962966412213006336 2018-02-12 08:27:38 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @SwissKLA Would you please explain how my position on sports is misogynistic in your view? This makes absolutely no sense to me and I would like to hear the details of your opinion rather than just the opinion itself.
962965918027575297 2018-02-12 08:25:40 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @SwissKLA You're not misinterpreting me. Our psychological and social developments are based on our experiences of our bodies and their relationship to the world and others like us. Our identities and emotional connections to ourselves are created in tandem with our development.
962962929204285440 2018-02-12 08:13:47 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw However, I do disagree that a rapist can't heal. Everyone can change.   Like Kesha, I hope my rapist is praying.   I hope he's changing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Dur3uXXCQ
962962419634098176 2018-02-12 08:11:46 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw Me too. If a rapist transitions then is raped by one of the men they share their prison with, I view that as poetic justice. I'm fine if they live in fear of that happening to them. I'm not fine if other women are made subject to that same fear.
962961107034963968 2018-02-12 08:06:33 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @SwissKLA You might want to re-read the previous tweet.  "my opinions are ignored because I'm not a man"
962960635075145730 2018-02-12 08:04:41 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @SwissKLA I don't have any dogma. I'm just trying to be myself and  live the most peaceful and harmonious life I can.
962959854754320384 2018-02-12 08:01:34 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @SwissKLA "Funny, too, how you can be of a mind, but women of a different mind are transphobic."  This does not reflect the reality of anything I have said or inferred in this thread or any other thread I have ever participated in. This is a biased assumption you have inferred on to me.
962959398640537600 2018-02-11 07:59:46 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @SwissKLA should remain segregated from those they have offended.
962959193400594432 2018-02-11 07:58:57 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @SwissKLA Yes, I do, if it can be shown that dysphoric distress is the root cause to the offense of any criminal and prison counselors agree that transition could be a rehabilitative experience for a criminal, it absolutely should be allowed but with respect to integration, sex offenders >
962958055762792448 2018-02-11 07:54:26 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @SwissKLA You're conflating two separate distinctions I was making. All women share biophysical similarities certainly, but none share the same bodily experience but perhaps twins. Psychosocially however, we develop in the same way, reacting to our bodily and circumstantial experience.
962955659347136512 2018-02-11 07:44:54 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw @SwissKLA True misogyny is denying trans women access to sports with the argument that women are incapable of competing with us. This is all misogynistic nonsense and here's the proof:  Everyone gets upset every time trans women win.  No one notices when we lose.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=remsCdsLLJM

Masculinity is celebrated, femininity is denigrated in men and women alike as well as in our language and culture. Both should be celebrated equally in all things. They're not.

962920080307867648 2018-02-11 05:23:31 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 Their terms are unreasonable because there's no physical indication of them and they tend to lash out whenever someone isn't psychic enough to know to use them. As such, I don't see any of them ever catching on in society so I kind of feel like it's a non-issue.
962919555348750336 2018-02-11 05:21:26 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 I agree that it muddles linguistic waters, but I think you're reading a bit too far into it otherwise. The people pushing for that  just want those linguistic terms to be validated for their lives. The idea that they're colluding to subvert society seems absurd to me.
962918090433613824 2018-02-11 05:15:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 "yoking public policy to their ideology"  Is this in reference to C-16 and Bill 89 again or does this go deeper than that?

962917208140730368 2018-02-11 05:12:07 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 Do you really think those are fair comparisons to make with those demanding the right to marry and/or control the linguistic and legal terms of their lives?

962915703375396865 2018-02-11 05:06:08 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 It's less that they're looking for victims than they feel like victims themselves, and as such they lash out at anything they view as the source of their victimhood. Can't tell you how many religious extremists have accused me of persecuting them.
962915198456778752 2018-02-11 05:04:08 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @OgerFoundation @Rick41510689 Hey now, I'm a Humanities graduate and consider myself a feminist. I'm also an egalitarian, however, which typically gets me labeled as an "MRA troll" by extreme feminists.
962913957219569665 2018-02-11 04:59:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @OgerFoundation @Rick41510689 No form of extremism should ever be romanticized in my opinion.
962913485914083328 2018-02-11 04:57:19 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 I don't actually consider myself a "leftist" by the way, I'm more of a centrist. I tend to favor left-wing ideas as they often favor me but I'm of a Christian/Conservative family. Traditional values are in my blood. I'm also from Mike Pence's hometown believe it or not.
962912573992636417 2018-02-11 04:53:42 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 This is a wonderful view to hold. We should value our roots, and adhere to them as much as possible, but every tree needs pruning in order to bear good fruit. It makes me happy that we have people both maintaining our roots and pruning our branches.
962911819009585152 2018-02-11 04:50:42 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @OgerFoundation @Rick41510689 "seems pleasant on the surface, pure venom underneath"  This has been my exact experience with right-wing extremists. Especially the religious sort, which makes me especially sad because I grew up Christian and the Bible's teachings have a special place in my heart.
962910660802809856 2018-02-11 04:46:06 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @OgerFoundation @Rick41510689 It's frothing at the mouth in general that's the issue. Not one side or the other. The ideological extremists of both sides will equally as readily froth at the mouth and tread all over the lives of others and both are equally wrong to do so.
962910289418162176 2018-02-11 04:44:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @OgerFoundation @Rick41510689 You do realize this works both ways right? I have been harassed and persecuted much more than you in my life, I assure you.
962910031678267392 2018-02-11 04:43:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @OgerFoundation @Rick41510689 Here's an example: Embracing LGBT people in society is going to lead to a change in dynamics of abortion. As we can marry and live normal lives, we will pair off more regularly and adopt. Adoption will become a more viable alternative, resolving the political conflict of abortion
962908778365583360 2018-02-11 04:38:37 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @OgerFoundation @Rick41510689 This one, in which the ideological and perceptual shift has been to the benefit of a largely downtrodden portion of society which can now live full and open lives without hiding our true selves to the benefit of not only ourselves but everyone we interact with in our lives.
962907565154807808 2018-02-11 04:33:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @OgerFoundation @Rick41510689 I've seen this before, I think I found it through one of Sargon's videos. While I can agree there is ideological subversion happening and that left-wing activists are bringing about shifts in perception, I believe this is with positive intent which will ultimately benefit society
962905683325784064 2018-02-11 04:26:19 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 I will as soon as I get the chance. I've seen plenty of this sort of thing though, I follow a large number of people who view these issues as you do. I feel its important to be critical of the activism intended to be supporting my life and as such I value these sorts of opinions.
962904276854026240 2018-02-11 04:20:44 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @NewWorldHominin @Jenn_pansexual @OgerFoundation @Rick41510689 It was interpreted that way by the university, where the bill is not relevant. It sounds like to me that this university inferred its own values on to the bill and then cited it in their reasoning and then both political sides ran around with it creating political wildfires.
962903384868163584 2018-02-11 04:17:11 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Khn_z9FPmU
962902993405468673 2018-02-11 04:15:38 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 Studies on homosexuality have shown that as society has embraced it, we have seen similar behavioral responses. I believe that once the dust settles over transgender people in society, such behaviors will become much more empirically prevalent.
962902243623276544 2018-02-11 04:12:39 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 In my own life, the stability that transition has brought to me has moved beyond myself. It impacts everyone I interact with in my life in equally positive ways. My presence is one that can and has brought togetherness to my family, friends, community, co-workers, and customers.
962900534041743360 2018-02-11 04:05:51 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 I'm speaking only to binary transitions by the way. I'm not a big fan of Tumblr genders or any of the 9283918391 new pronouns. I could accept embracing neutral pronouns, but I think anything else is rather unreasonable to expect of society.
962900126518992898 2018-02-11 04:04:14 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 I don't believe evidence does suggest this. In fact, evidence suggests the opposite. Without transition, we live subhuman lives, unable to exist or to functionally participate in society. Transitioning stabilizes us and allows us to exist harmoniously and at peace with ourselves.
962898935655358464 2018-02-11 03:59:30 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 First of all, many who transition don't undergo any surgery at all, let alone SRS. HRT is all most of us need. It costs decisively less for HRT than 5+ years of counselling and whatever alternative therapies (drugs, conversion, electroshock, etc) one might undergo instead.
962897953684934656 2018-02-11 03:55:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @NewWorldHominin @Jenn_pansexual @OgerFoundation @Rick41510689 Was Lindsay Shepherd actually brought up on C-16 charges or did the idiots running the university she works at just decide of their own dumb accord to cite C-16 in the reasoning behind their concerns over her showing Peterson videos to class?
962897358307627008 2018-02-11 03:53:14 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 @OgerFoundation This is how I've interpreted C-16 also. It created this addition to an already established law that was functioning appropriately. I don't see how it can do the kinds of damage many say it will. If it does, sure, it should be repealed, but I don't see it happening.
962896426882781184 2018-02-11 03:49:32 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 That's a fair view in my opinion. In my case, I personally wish I could rewind time and transition pre-puberty. I do think that in the most extreme circumstances, it should be allowed. However, it should generally be viewed as a last resort. Everything else should be tried first.
962895661812322304 2018-02-11 03:46:30 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 I'm with Judith Butler here. The right to self-determination is more important than the methodology behind it. Whether one uses a fixed sense based on sex or a more fluid one based on gender, we all have the right to control of the linguistic and legal terms of our own lives.
962895023686733824 2018-02-11 03:43:58 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @OgerFoundation @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 C-16 seems decisively less dangerous than those who fear-monger over it make it out to be. It passed 31 weeks ago. Not one person has been arrested and it's caused no societal damage I've heard about. If you've seen any issues it's caused yourself, I'd like to hear about them.
962894411486191616 2018-02-11 03:41:32 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @OgerFoundation @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 I'm American and just recently became aware of @MorganeOgerBC but what little exposure I have had hasn't looked like good methodology to me.
962893809247051776 2018-02-11 03:39:08 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 I have mixed feelings about Bill 89. I believe it should be more geared toward those who refuse to address/acknowledge dysphoria than gender ID. Dysphoria can be dealt with in a variety of ways, transition should only be considered for young people in the most extreme cases.
962892542558769153 2018-02-11 03:34:06 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 Arguments over spaces come in a variety of contexts. Primarily physical spaces like bathrooms/changing rooms/shelters/prisons and competitive spaces like sports/job markets. I'm working on an article about these concerns for my blog right now. Happy to link when done if you like.
962886714611126274 2018-02-11 03:10:56 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 The problem is that trans people are a tiny number of people, and the activists who have taken up our banner often for political/financial gain are too great in number for us to combat. I'm doing my part, but the reductive activists are overwhelming.
962886163278303232 2018-02-11 03:08:45 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 Same for this, could you clarify the sort of legislation you're referring to? I have some strong opinions over much of the reductive legislation I've seen, and equally strong ones for the more proactive and beneficial legislation.
962885722993778689 2018-02-11 03:07:00 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 Could you clarify the sorts of spaces you're concerned over? I am of the mind that it's best we integrate with our transitioned genders, with the caveat that we be sensitive toward the issues integration has potential to create. I'd love to discuss this if you're willing.
962884326961635329 2018-02-11 03:01:27 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 That's fair. Thank you for responding. Biology is a valid thing which carries a great deal of importance to many people, especially in the context of sexual preferences. Those preferences should be celebrated. Plenty of fish in the sea for us with differing preferences.
962882652486463489 2018-02-11 02:54:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 Calling me a man takes me back to that, and it hurts deeply. As do the arguments over my reproductive capabilities. My inability to conceive is something that burdens me and pains me more deeply than anyone could know. Nothing hurts more than those attacks.
962881716846317569 2018-02-11 02:51:05 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 For me, whenever someone insists I'm a man, it's like someone insisting I not exist. Prior to transition, I wasn't a man, I was a ghost chained to a body which didn't match my bodily experience of myself and didn't represent me socially or psychologically.
962880991986675713 2018-02-11 02:48:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Jenn_pansexual @Rick41510689 Thank you for the kind words. May I ask, do you consider trans women to be women and men to be men? For most of us who internalize people like yourself hate us, it's because we view this attitude as hateful. For us, being our former gender is akin to non-existence.
962876361777078272 2018-02-11 02:29:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw This I agree with also. I'm not comfortable with that idea either, though I do stand by my assertion that if transition can be a pathway to healing, it should be allowed, even in the case of a rapist. But in that case, remaining placed among men would probably be best.
962875689073545216 2018-02-11 02:27:08 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw I'm of the same belief. Men who would pretend to be women in order to access our spaces to indulge in perversion or to abuse would do so regardless of trans women. So long as there are government processes to legitimize transition, anyone who would be spurred into it is detoured.
962873131017805824 2018-02-11 02:16:58 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @thalestral @RadFemme74 Hope you don't mind me asking, but do you think you still would have transitioned in a world where you could have? I love hearing trans perspectives on this question. For me, dysphoria ran way deeper than cultural desires, so I'm certain I would have.
962872364441718784 2018-02-11 02:13:55 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw Prisons are tricky. If transition can be a pathway to healing for a criminal, it should be allowed and I believe they should be placed among their transitioned sex with the understanding that prisons are better equipped to handle conflicts in that scenario than the opposite.
962871560821452800 2018-02-11 02:10:44 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw In bathrooms, showers. and changing areas, I believe privacy is key. Everyone should have safety and privacy in these spaces regardless of sex/gender and I think it's better to focus on that than segregation.
962870239187873792 2018-02-11 02:05:28 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw In shelters, it's a valid point that some women may want to be secluded from trans women following abuse. PTSD can be triggered by the experience of anything related to an abuser and part of processing trans women can include an experience of men, which is worth sensitivity to.
962869391825219584 2018-02-11 02:02:06 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw In sports, we have anatomical differences worth considering but I'm of the mind that trans inclusion in sports should be left to judges and competitors to decide on. Women who wish to welcome the potential challenge of our anatomical differences should be celebrated for doing so.
962868963628802048 2018-02-11 02:00:24 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw It's easiest to break this down by context. In sex, biological preferences are valid whether one is hetero or homosexual. However, sexuality is expressed in tandem with gender so I do feel it is linguistically appropriate to term TW who date men as straight and women as lesbians.
962867957503315971 2018-02-11 01:56:24 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw There are obvious biological and developmental differences worth acknowledging in many contexts, though I hold some differences of opinion with most radfems on the best ways to handle/acknowledge these differences.
962867225626599430 2018-02-11 01:53:30 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw I've seen this too and I hate it. Those are all perfectly valid views. Gender-based and sex-based self-interpretations are equally valid and worthy of celebration IMO. Nothing's wrong with biological preferences to sexuality. We ARE similar, but it's wrong to claim we're same.
962864280055025664 2018-02-11 01:41:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Dannahw I speak against that to TRA's as best I can. Just because someone shares anti-trans beliefs and/or concerns does not make them part of the cult. Disparaging concerns of people like yourself cements bias against us and causes people to fall into transphobic thinking.
962860547086667776 2018-02-11 01:26:58 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @ArtistIzzy The way into mine is memes. Though I think I'd accept stuffed animals in place of memes, there's some crossover there.

962839476383993858 2018-02-11 00:03:14 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Neither will any other women with developmental issues. That's the nature of developmental conditions.

962691490857275393 2018-02-11 14:15:12 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Thanks! And also thanks for the conversation. It's nice to have a respectful dialogue even though we disagree on some fundamentals. This has been one of the better conversations I've ever had on Twitter. I'm probably done for now but I hope this isn't the last of our chats 
962689421287059457 2018-02-11 14:06:58 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @jeremymartin72 @globalist_chill @_Vampirate_ If it has a higher chance of being someone tagged in a lot of your tweets, that makes sense because you're obsessed with her dick.
962688949419376640 2018-02-11 14:05:06 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @jeremymartin72 @globalist_chill @_Vampirate_ Good question. I think it goes through your tweet history and looks at tags then picks one at random.

962686642116071424 2018-02-11 13:55:55 UTC <drawnoutofshape> LMAO
962685445707624448 2018-02-11 13:51:10 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I know now every bit of what it's like to move through the world with female bodily experience. The world gives me the same pushback as any other woman. I've never once been known by anyone to be trans unless I told them so. Not even by the human garbage who assaulted me.
962684156584001542 2018-02-11 13:46:03 UTC <drawnoutofshape> We can't fully realize our lives as women until our bodies change, but once that happens, I feel it's appropriate we be considered women because we share biological features and social circumstances. Our post-transition understandings are not superficial in the least.
962683761086353408 2018-02-11 13:44:29 UTC <drawnoutofshape> There's truth to this. However, I view dysphoria more as a biologically-based developmental disorder. Neither the body nor the brain is wrong, they just are the way they are. Bringing the body in-line with the brain ends the incongruence but we're left developmentally stunted.
962680686644809728 2018-02-11 13:32:16 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Loui_Hilli Sorry for writing you a novel in response. I'm done!  Have I mentioned I adore Twitter's increased character limit? :^)
962680301452517376 2018-02-11 13:30:44 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Loui_Hilli My body's no longer a burden on me and I've been enabled to actualize my presence in the world. The only distress I experience remains in my inability to conceive. I still have dreams of being a mother. Thankfully adoption's an option in my part of the world.
962679105119490048 2018-02-11 13:25:59 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Loui_Hilli I'm of a traditional Christian/Conservative background. I denied myself HRT for so long. I tried *everything* to treat my mind to deal with this incongruence instead of my body. I'm convinced that's impossible. The bodily treatments have worked wonders though.
962676789251321858 2018-02-11 13:16:46 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Loui_Hilli I experienced myself like an amputee might experience phantom limbs. My body didn't have parts I physically felt I had. Living like this, I developed emotional connections to my body as I experienced it. Leaning how sex worked was devastating for me knowing I'd never conceive.
962676002316046336 2018-02-11 13:13:39 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @Loui_Hilli You're welcome, thank you for joining in the dialogue! My gender has been innate to my bodily experience. I've been aware of the incongruent state of my being since I learned to think. 1/2 my biology creating female experience, the other half appearing otherwise.
962670538349924352 2018-02-11 12:51:56 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I'm from Indiana. We don't have Self-ID here. Never have. Our government has been very helpful in providing us with reasonable laws and legitimizing processes to transition. My ID has an F on it. This one letter brings me and everyone I exist with so much protection/safety.
962667435768852480 2018-02-11 12:39:36 UTC <drawnoutofshape> And I don't mean trans children either. I mean girls who would be confused and ask their parents uncomfortable questions about the men in their spaces and vice versa for boys.
962666747760390144 2018-02-11 12:36:52 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "before" because things have been different in my part of the world but I assume you mean being forced to use men's facilities? If so, yes I think that's a terrible idea for all. Children would suffer most in that reality.
962656987942137856 2018-02-11 11:58:05 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I've written about this in further detail in my blog if you'd be at all interested:https://misstree.life/2018/01/12/roots-dedication-identification/
962656380850188288 2018-02-11 11:55:41 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I agree with you completely here. Self-ID harms trans and natal women alike. Government ID protects us all.
962655623707013120 2018-02-11 11:52:40 UTC <drawnoutofshape> How does any woman know what it's like to be any other woman? We don't. We only have our own unique experiences of our own bodies. In my case, this has been my life's biophysical experience and as such my psychosocial development has reflected it, same as all women.
962653956391493635 2018-02-11 11:46:03 UTC <drawnoutofshape> I'm from Mike Pence's home town. It's as traditional as it gets in America. Yet never once in my entire life caused any discomfort or met any conflict over any of the spaces I have occupied. As an assault survivor, I'm grateful. The idea of using men's/third spaces terrifies me.
962652614692401156 2018-02-11 11:40:43 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Third spaces are a logistical nightmare which are simply not feasible in most public locations and I'm not sure if you've ever considered the danger of the target which may be placed on your head for entering and/or leaving such a space.
962652109098319872 2018-02-11 11:38:42 UTC <drawnoutofshape> It's my opinion that if governments support legitimizing processes to transition, there will be no issues sharing spaces as there have been no issues in my state as well as the vast majority of states in the US with no such rules. Self-ID causes these problems, not sharing spaces
962651361786716160 2018-02-11 11:35:44 UTC <drawnoutofshape> That explains the difference in our experiences with radfems, I disagree on those points. I was debilitated by dysphoria my entire life. I've never known myself as anything other than a girl and now woman and I believe third spaces are an impossible and dangerous pipedream.

962639491470123008 2018-02-11 10:48:34 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE The depressing irony of it all is that my opinions are being devalued based upon my womanhood. If I claimed manhood, they would care for the things I have to say, but as a woman, my voice must be silenced at all costs.
962638216070418432 2018-02-11 10:43:30 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE I'm someone who is generally very fair-minded and considerate of the concerns of others. I've made so many attempts to engage peacefully with them. I understand their concerns and have many constructive ideas for addressing them, but my opinions are ignored because I'm not a man.
962638163301814272 2018-02-11 10:43:17 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE While you're not wrong about some TRA's, radfems do have their own cult-like mantras. Most act as gatekeepers to womanhood who maintain that I am a man and unless I repeat this "man"tra, I'm deemed an enemy and then they lash out against me.
962633720632094720 2018-02-11 10:25:38 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Thanks for responding! I agree with a lot of ideas behind radical feminism and find engaging with gender critical theory fascinating, but I disagree with the ways many apply those arguments to trans issues. Do you consider yourself a man or think we belong in men's spaces?
962631882948083712 2018-02-11 10:18:20 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @jessicazoeb In spite of all of the science and evidence I have provided in the arguments I've engaged in, I've never once met anyone who actually engaged with the research or made any attempt whatsoever to either understand it or refute it. I'm just told I'm wrong and a man over and over.
962629823012200448 2018-02-11 10:10:09 UTC <drawnoutofshape> @notCursedE @jessicazoeb I'm a very well-read researcher. I offer science and evidence to back all of my claims. I've only once had a radfem offer me any science or evidence and what was provided to me was a screenshot of quotes about schizophrenia which were being masked as trans-related citations.
962625709054324736 2018-02-11 09:53:48 UTC <drawnoutofshape> Who's attacked you for that? I've been agreeing with radical feminism on this point for years and I've never been attacked by anyone but radfems who thought I didn't agree with them enough. Seems impossible to get along with most unless we capitulate the fact we are women to them
