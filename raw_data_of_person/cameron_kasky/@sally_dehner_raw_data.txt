972228483345715200 2018-03-09 21:51:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily I would rather we spend $139K on fixing the Interior office by removing Zinke.  That would be an excellent use of funds and a much needed improvement.
971990841433628672 2018-03-08 06:07:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing How to phrase this tactfully....because the adults in the room su.., because the adults in the room are cra., because the adults in the room speak bul...., shoot, there is just no way to answer this question tactfully.  Truly the only real adults addressing the question are kids.
971818631242887168 2018-03-08 18:43:11 UTC <sally_dehner> You must read this speech.  To think people chose trump over love, clarity, eloquence, passion, and intelligence.  You could have had Hillary, but no you wanted a 2nd rate reality tv star with racist tendencies, a lack of ethics and the attention span of a toddler.https://twitter.com/GraceJelsnik/status/971750347294236673
971817894609870848 2018-03-08 18:40:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @GraceJelsnik Wow! To think we could have had a woman with this brilliant mind, clear sight, love for women and children and eloquence, leading our nation.  But no we have trump. The heart weeps.
971786129212084225 2018-03-08 16:34:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @lensweet Here is the translation of my favorite verse, from the original poem, "The Redeemer has broken every bond: The Earth is free, and Heaven is open. He sees a brother where there was only a slave, Love unites those that iron had chained."
971767093245939714 2018-03-08 15:18:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @lensweet My favorite verse, often omitted. Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother; And in His name all oppression shall cease.

971514395867123714 2018-03-07 22:34:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 Glad to hear you are not an NRA member (to be clear you cant be a member of PP, just a supporter or a user of its services).
971513750040834048 2018-03-07 22:31:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 Never trusted Russia & because of that I dont actually think the questions about Russia now are BS. Something is going on, meddling, laundering, its all havey-cavey. Why would NRA officials hang out with Russians? Why does 45* think Russia is a friend to be admired?
971500168460800000 2018-03-07 21:37:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 If I had to choose between supporting the NRA or PP, I'd choose PP because they are way more altruistic than the NRA which has an agenda I suspect they keep hidden from their members.  Maybe 2A people need to start a new gun club.
971499694563250176 2018-03-07 21:35:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 PP gets reimbursed (like any doctor or clinic) for the health care it provides. As a charity it gets donations from people like me; especially like giving in name of Pence  NRA gets money from where? Memberships are a drop in the bucket. Gun manufacturers? Dare I say Russia??
971497349284581377 2018-03-07 21:26:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily So basically the Republicans think Carter Page is sort of the linchpin to the disaster upon them & if they can make the report on him "go away" they will be home free.  Really, you all think we are blind to your infamy?
971460524625006594 2018-03-07 19:00:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP Let me fix this, "the best days for corporate prosperity are here, because trump tax scam is starting to make a positive difference for the 1%."  This man lives in alternate reality land.
971459595796402176 2018-03-07 18:56:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 I looked up the websites of both PP & NRA. Very telling. First thing NRA asks for is money for membership, shares NRATV crap.  PP gives information about health, has a live chat. PP offers upfront charity reports w/full disclosure. NRA? No reports despite being a 5013c. Surprise!
971456541017731073 2018-03-07 18:44:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 I will grant you that point, that PP is an organization with an agenda. Women's health & their right to legal, safe abortion is totally under attack; glad you recognize that fact. The 2nd Amendment is not "under attack." I wonder, how much do the makers of condoms donate to PP?
971453605415981057 2018-03-07 18:32:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 Humm. I believe the NRA says if you want to protect your 2A right you need to join. Reminds me of the scam phone calls I get.
971452995513802752 2018-03-07 18:30:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 You do understand the term brainwashing don't you? If you've been brainwashed of course you don't know it!
971450333686849539 2018-03-07 18:19:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 The word was "irregardless "
971450098507972608 2018-03-07 18:18:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 I am not so sure that the NRA organization isn't an evil entity. The members, I believe, are being mislead about it's true agenda which is why I use the term brainwashed.
971449661730050050 2018-03-07 18:17:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 Yes, I do not admire the NRA for their desire to arm everyone it regardless and the fact that they use huge sums of money to influence our legislators against us. I am also against right-to-work which really is right to work for less. It is a disaster in states that have it.
971448452080132097 2018-03-07 18:12:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 You really go off the wall with throwing PP in. Although I guess they do lobby for women's health & welfare. Comparing them to the NRA is really apples to arsenic.
971447857394962432 2018-03-07 18:09:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 Planned Parenthood is exactly what it's title says; an organization helping women & men with family planning. A union is a group of employees banding together to negotiate with employers for better wages safer working conditions. NRA is a gun lobbyist. No comparison.
971445706572681216 2018-03-07 18:01:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 The comparison of unions to NRA is not even apples to oranges, more like apples to arsenic.
971445110067081216 2018-03-07 17:58:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 Views of their membership or the gun manufacturers? I see some members touting the no gun control line but not all. It is a sad come down from an admirable organization that taught gun safety & sportsmanship to what it is today. LaPierre & Loesch as spokespeople? Yuck.
971422044117184512 2018-03-07 16:27:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @funder But trump has broken federal law also. So if he fires Conway he's in big trouble. What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.
971421512006819841 2018-03-07 16:25:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP I'm curious. Does our vp actually believe and live in this alternate reality? Or does he know exactly what is going on and wakes up every morning wondering, "Am I president yet?" I'm just not sure-clueless or culpable ?
971419471490572289 2018-03-07 16:17:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @stonecold2050 I read this tweet to my husband and he said, "Who?" Can't stop laughing. Sorry, Scott Baio.
971391023200067585 2018-03-07 14:24:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @TRUMP4ISRAEL You had me until your last sentence. Another NRA brainwash victim. So sad.
971389436079607808 2018-03-07 14:17:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @KyleKashuv @righty64 Bipartisanly is a word but I see no middle ground here. Im a lot older than the kids in the original conversation; I see the NRA has become a major lobbyist. They have their money agenda & insisting 2A means all weapons for all people is their tactic. They have brainwashed well.
971222673689841669 2018-03-06 03:15:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily No, bumbling campaign staffers are the face of the trump presidency and Conway and Sanders are the pinup girls for the chaos.
971219835731546112 2018-03-06 03:03:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @CREWcrew Would that be six months in jail for every seal for every tee?
971088787081191425 2018-03-06 18:23:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @Pajjr2016 @activist360 The president is supposed to discipline Conway for doing the same things he does? Wont that be awkward?
971086677388210177 2018-03-06 18:14:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @funder It says a lot about this administration that violating the Hatch Act twice seems like small potatoes & hardly raises an eyebrow. Everyday this WH breaks the law, violates ethics, lies, devalues tradition and literally pisses on the trust and greatness of this nation.
971065965344624640 2018-03-06 16:52:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @Amy_Siskind The smart liberal woman's version of "abstinence."

I wanted to rescue all the dogs, cats, cows. And who knew someone like @catlady4Christ actually existed? Why would someone who professes love for Christ and cats be a rabid trumpet?
971027653171048448 2018-03-06 14:20:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @GrassrootsSpeak Trump cheats at golf
971025398787174401 2018-03-06 14:11:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @AAlhanti This is why trump became a reality tv personality rather than a comedian. Every..single..joke..flops.
971022383296499712 2018-03-06 13:59:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily That someone of trumps reputation could seriously favor "abstinence" is definitely a highlight of this presidency. Instead of the oath of office, he apparently substituted the "hypocritic oath."
971021490031390720 2018-03-06 13:55:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @RandyRainbow In Robert's defense, he seems like an okay guy but not the drama club type. This may be an honest mistake. Hopefully he'll watch a few RR videos and get the picture.
971020495821983749 2018-03-06 13:51:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @RobertArtis10 And Zinke and Pruitt and Chao and Carson and Ivanka and Jared and Huckabee Sanders and Tillerson and Sessions and Conway and Miller and ________ (you fill in the blank of other national disgraces I have missed.)

No, I do it for your own good and I do it for free. Resist the trump force before its too late. (Us resisters always get a kick out of the Soros thing, right along with but her emails.)

Check out Cambridge Analytica & the words of Brad Pasquale, they were all in on it. Wait, did you mention uranium? Read, read, read! It will help you understand how you are being played.

While you are at it, go back & read transcripts of the presidential debates. Hillary laid it all out, the entire trump fiasco. She knew.
970909802053464064 2018-03-05 06:31:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 I ask again, is trump a dupe or a mastermind? I read his tweets and look at the children he produced and I think dupe. But what is going on right now is scary and requires some intelligence to pull off. Is that plot homegrown or all Russia grown?
970909113659076609 2018-03-05 06:29:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 Oh honey, we know there was Russian interference. The fact that they were desperate to have trump rather than Hillary to deal with should have been a major red flag. There is a lot of smoke & mirrors, all to cover the worst Republican corruption in history.

When will you people switch that crap off and do some actual reading, research and factfinding? No wonder you are all confused, seeing boogeymen everywhere. Hannity, OReilly and the like have a lot to answer for.

Trump=treason.
970904577573904384 2018-03-05 06:11:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 Sorry that you fell victim to the whole NWO scam. Are there many more of you that need to be cured?

I remember with fondness watching Nixon leave the WH. Will enjoy even more watching the orange menace do so. I dont really care whether he is impeached or imprisoned; either will save our country.
970903075656536064 2018-03-05 06:05:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 Almost 70 million deluded voters who were brainwashed into thinking a second rate reality show host with a history of racial discrimination, cheating and sexual harassment would make a good president. Who was responsible for this travesty? You have not saved our country. Wake up!
970892323658878979 2018-03-05 05:22:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @OregonJOBS2 Although Im not a constituent of an Oregon senator or representative & cannot vote for them, they are still, on the federal level, making decisions that impact me. That is why, besides giving money, I dont hesitate to call other states Senators & Reps about pending legislation.
970891124020842497 2018-03-05 05:17:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @OregonJOBS2 I would be okay with this if Citizens United were eliminated & other reforms were in place. It is hard for a candidate to fight against the obscene amounts of money coming from lobbyists. Just look at the NRA money. That is why I give to candidates outside my state.
970887422815989760 2018-03-05 05:02:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 So you admit our country is in enough peril right now I might need physical rescue; that is interesting. I firmly believe that God is with me but God expects us to work for the kingdom. Social justice is the touchstone; something this administration denies at its peril.
970886582092947456 2018-03-05 04:59:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @Great_Again2018 I wonder sometimes whether this administration is just inept or is there something darker going on. Sometimes trump does seem like a clown but other times there seems to be something or someone else at work here. I thought it was Bannon but now Im not sure. Trump as mastermind??
970885684377645056 2018-03-05 04:55:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 Yes the bitterness and hatred is strong in America right now. And who fomented that? None other than the orange menace. There is much to be frightened about from a ruined economy to a possibility of nuclear war. This is a president that needs to be removed quickly.
970884671990042626 2018-03-05 04:51:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 Oh I have made note of your misguided philosophy as well. Let me know when the shit hits the fan if you are okay.

If you did you wouldnt support the person who is turning out to be a bigger disaster than the Titanic. I couldnt even list all his lies, faults and cheats if twitter had 100,000 characters. America deserves better than him.
970883396875489280 2018-03-05 04:46:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 This administration is indeed the Titanic; they are burning the lifeboats themselves and tossing American values off the deck. Lying & cheating is a way of life for them. It is an American tragedy yet the snark in me cant help laughing while waiting for the latest scandal.
970881348050317317 2018-03-05 04:38:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 Wait, are you really defending TRUMP??  oh my God. So sorry. You have my sympathy. Don Jr. cant change who his father is but you had a choice and you blew it.

970879128252633088 2018-03-05 04:29:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 I get you! Trump was elected by voter fraud i.e., gerrymandering, voter suppression & Russian meddling. The corruption being displayed by his administration combined with the incredible ineptness of the so called great businessman is frankly unbelievable. Stay strong America!
970876287773499393 2018-03-05 04:18:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @forgiven_all @DonaldJTrumpJr @Great_Again2018 Blame, division, fraud, corruption, selfishness, complete & total waste, perfect description of this administration. The sooner it is held accountable for it's crimes against the nation the better. That any of you believe trump is in your corner is laughable.
970785141244260355 2018-03-05 22:16:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Just another example of why liberal women are the smartest.

Georgia and her politicians will not take this sitting down.  They want that title back!

A poor excuse for a TV star. Didn't write those books. Overcame adversity? by using Russia to win. Sad, very sad.
970680236491845633 2018-03-05 15:19:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @Newsweek @SafetyPinDaily Reminds me of when a Cabela's salesperson tried to sell me a purple handgun. Really, does a gun being purple make me look more girly if I'm open-carrying at Dennys?
970678410413473793 2018-03-05 15:12:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @Montel_Williams Using the same right of free speech that Ms. Loesch is entitled to, I would say the gun porn portrayal is bad enough but recreating this scene from a 1939 movie is not a good look for her. I believe she is a frustrated actress & only NRATV was willing to give her a job.
970668685408030722 2018-03-05 14:33:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @WHCommHopeHicks @BobinHB Wow, it took Hope a twenty minute confab with lawyers and consulting with the WH to come up with an answer of "white lies."

970532164558311424 2018-03-04 05:31:14 UTC <sally_dehner> 48 years of marriage; two people on opposite sides of the political fence. Me, a liberal, him, a conservative and then came 45*.  My husband just said we should send a donation to the #ACLU.  I am in total shock.

970491214897340416 2018-03-04 02:48:31 UTC <sally_dehner> I think so too. Oh and #FireKushnerhttps://twitter.com/creleesta/status/970363840956452867
970489799625801729 2018-03-04 02:42:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @perlmutations The head ammosexual seems to be confused herself about the freedoms our flag represents. Dana, ask not for whom the sands of time flow, they flow for you.
970474928578400256 2018-03-04 01:43:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @TiffanyBond @joe_bouvier Dana Loesch verifies the NRA as a terrorist group every time she speaks. Hunters, do you really support this sort of dirt thrown on you and your sport?
970473637601071109 2018-03-04 01:38:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @pencolton @kylegriffin1 Sounds like pretty much every thing was tasteless at that event.
970395565115756545 2018-03-04 20:28:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @HCDotNet @RyanAFournier @Auntdiggie12 Uh, actually from the comments here, I think its Ryan that got schooled. Boooom!!!
970394872803921920 2018-03-04 20:25:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @katt9454 @RyanAFournier @777_888_777 This is why we need to boycott Amazon; they sell stupid junk like this. My whining about lax gun laws supersedes your right to have AR-15s. First Amendment rights versus your right to be armed in the militia, see?
970393773829251072 2018-03-04 20:21:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @RyanAFournier @PoliticalPegs @maggalish83 @JerryMeeks68 Neither of those things relate to the 2nd Amendment plus you could still have weapons if there were a waiting period, stringent background checks, licensing, insurance, restrictions and no bump stocks, ammunition limits. See how that works?
970391231346958336 2018-03-04 20:11:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Why did trump become a reality TV personality instead of a comedian? Probably because hes never made a joke that didnt bomb.
970374281736663040 2018-03-04 19:03:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @mcspocky @mmpadellan @PrincessBravato @docrocktex26 @bill_auclair I sometimes wonder if CPS should move in and rescue Barron. It cant be good for a child to be raised in a family like this.
970373479211196416 2018-03-04 19:00:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @Salon @SafetyPinDaily Pretty much anything 45* has a hand in is doomed to failure. GOP is offering thoughts and prayers to our nation in its time of tragedy.
970372727331844096 2018-03-04 18:57:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers To Ms Stargel: by your words I assume you are a Christian. Please read James 2:14-26.
970294109532508160 2018-03-04 13:45:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @Chetlsmith @David_Rudnick In the Parkland shooting survivors I hear echoes of this history-activist young people and a desire by the powers-that-be to get rid of them. Just read some of the comments by NRA members and other alt-right factions directed at these students. Eerily similar.
970290356033064965 2018-03-04 13:30:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily May I state the obvious? He should really call on Melania Trump as bullying is her thing.
970116962327068672 2018-03-03 02:01:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly Not to take attention off this message but I do love the Freudian slip/typo "fundraider".
970115239667789825 2018-03-03 01:54:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @JoeRubin6 @TomthunkitsMind @susanpag65 I have no idea who you are talking about. There is a long list of Republican criminals, hard to choose from among them.
970108896340774912 2018-03-03 01:29:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @chellenelson17 @car_nove Wow Florida, that has to be a new record of hypocrisy in government. Shoot down an amendment to protect students, then have a moment of silence. Was that moment multi-purpose, intended to cover the next several school shootings?
970093373083279360 2018-03-03 00:27:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @thehill And just like that Florida steals the title of Most Stupid State away from Georgia, who had been the clear front runner.
970092010496458762 2018-03-03 00:22:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @JoeRubin6 @TomthunkitsMind @susanpag65 No, I imagine they want him gone because he committed the crimes on the trail. What a sorry excuse of a man and a politician.
969990072408903682 2018-03-03 17:37:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepMarkMeadows Planned Parenthood received an infusion of donations in honor of Mike Pence, probably enough to enable them to do some politicking; good for them. Reminder: they are reimbursed by taxpayer dollars for the many services they perform like mammograms etc. You know that, dont lie.
969988540762238977 2018-03-03 17:31:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @thisisforfreedl So a 19 year old deer hunter needs an AR-15? Not very sporting, apparently not a very good hunter.
969988097978109954 2018-03-03 17:29:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Its sad that we wonder which flag you pledge allegiance to, why you dont stand for the First Amendment and how come you dont know the words to our National Anthem.
969935592548126721 2018-03-03 14:00:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @FrancesRauer @JohnFugelsang I borrowed this and quoted it to a trumpet this morning. Thanks for the perfect image!
969933296435163136 2018-03-03 13:51:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattmfm @BrunoBacalla Honey, those are tears of laughter!! Magats trumpet everyday and we just shake our heads.
969932983867183105 2018-03-03 13:50:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattmfm @BrunoBacalla Here is the explanation of you. "It's like America's a bus and an 71 year old narcissist speed addict is maniacally driving and we're all staring at each other because 30% of the passengers like how his driving upsets the rest of us. "
969929275267788800 2018-03-03 13:35:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattmfm @BrunoBacalla Definitely the only thing that makes trump stronger. Otherwise he's pretty much a pansy. Those tweets yesterday? Hilarious if it weren't so scary. Middle school girl tweets about "rival". When will he start being prez? We are still waiting.
969923106423869442 2018-03-03 13:11:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @FrancesRauer @IronmanMann Is the sky blue?
969919913606504449 2018-03-03 12:58:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattmfm @BrunoBacalla I only report & block people who are a danger to themselves or others (that's why I report trump tweets) but misguided people will be changed, usually by an event that finally opens their eyes. Thoughts and prayers to you that your event isn't too horrible.
969917317151850497 2018-03-03 12:48:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattmfm @BrunoBacalla And I love trumpets moaning "I'm melting, I'm melting! Who knew beautiful truth would expose my wickedness?"
969792851746881536 2018-03-02 04:33:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @cameron_kasky @msdwrites @KFerrugia I am absolutely gobsmacked that the NRA would send death threats to high school students who've lived through more trauma than most adults. I'm gobsmacked that no one noticed that it was Florida's lax gun laws, not the FBI, the police or the school board that armed the shooter.
969780919082078208 2018-03-02 03:46:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattmfm @BrunoBacalla You're a heroin user? Well that explains some of your issues.
969780691075588096 2018-03-02 03:45:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @USATODAY @ercitall Just like I never darken the door of Hobby Lobby, I will choose to support Delta. Voting with your wallet makes sense. I try never to support companies whose corporate philosophy violates my own standards.
969779805678981126 2018-03-02 03:41:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @USAFMEDIC21 @USATODAY @cliff_washburn You really don't think that the issue was the cost of the discounts do you? Delta comes across looking like a company with integrity & Georgia comes off looking like a hick state that cut off their nose to spite their face. They smell like NRA manure; Delta smells like a rose.
969774164801400832 2018-03-02 03:19:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @DevinNunes @tedlieu Frankly Mr. Nunes, if your daughter realized the kind of politician as well as the sort of man you are she would be very ashamed and disappointed. Some day she will be old enough to understand and I feel sorry for you when that day comes.
969772682668625921 2018-03-02 03:13:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattmfm @BrunoBacalla Well as long as this administration continues to be the disaster it is you will certainly get your fill. Particularly amused by that last meme. Good old 45* has really brought the dregs up from the bottom of the cesspool. Everyday and every hate meme proves it o'er and o'er.
969747439153569792 2018-03-02 01:33:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattmfm @BrunoBacalla Oh honey, you lost but you just don't want to admit it . All of us practice everyday saying, "there, there, we know you were brainwashed, we won't hold it against you. You don't have to follow the dark path anymore. Just take my hand and I'll lead you to the light."
969743940458074113 2018-03-02 01:19:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @matthewsolomon He needs to add the asterisk that I place each time I use the expression "45*" which represents his listing in history books. Not sure whether the asterisk will denote impeachment, resignation, imprisonment but I know without a doubt it will be there.
969726958383849473 2018-03-02 00:11:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattmfm @BrunoBacalla Tweets from silly trumpets being snarky because people mention truth and fact always makes me . Love to see you het up. Tra-la-la-la-la.
969641135261061120 2018-03-02 18:30:36 UTC <sally_dehner> Eric Greitens-the mini trump.https://twitter.com/MoDemParty/status/969637488653471750
969638947499511808 2018-03-02 18:21:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @WaysMeansCmte He was speaking at the American Enterprise Institute. Take a look at their income/expenditures, the list of people affiliated with them now and in the past. AEI is the NRA for bubble brained fiscal conservatives.
969636095335063554 2018-03-02 18:10:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @tedlieu If it quacks like a duck, waddles like a duck.....it's probably insider trading.
969611345162272771 2018-03-02 16:32:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @RealMattCouch @RepMarkMeadows @Lilo_Abernathy @webbcharm Most of us Americans are pretty sick of the Russian meddling mess. If only certain members of this administration had remembered what they are elected for. If only an aging reality TV star hadnt been willing to get into bed with Putin to win an election. If only.
969608190689206272 2018-03-02 16:19:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Twenty states should file suit that trump is an illegal president. There is tons of evidence and they would be backed by the majority of the American people.
969579109956366337 2018-03-02 14:24:08 UTC <sally_dehner> Absolutely love  this cartoon.https://twitter.com/czesco/status/969421052668469248
969571504785633280 2018-03-02 13:53:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Kushner, the poster boy for who not to employ in the WH. As an unqualified relative who uses his position to line his pockets, hes perfect.
969567127341617153 2018-03-02 13:36:31 UTC <sally_dehner> Ive said this myself. But its pretty sad that a presidents biggest flaw would be that he tried to work with everybody and serve ALL the American people.https://twitter.com/nstallbaumer/status/969242445161562114
969476690878529537 2018-03-01 07:37:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @SteveScalise @jmgjackie You know what needs e-verifying? Every blasted con artist, grifter and hanger-on in this lousy administration.
969471185917566977 2018-03-01 07:15:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @HoarseWisperer Watched the whole thing. Was there truly not one brave person in Utah that said, "No, just no."
969467138716196864 2018-03-01 06:59:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @KamVTV Hmmm. No, I don't think so. Plus I wonder what it's like being the father of the official WH purveyor of lies.
969459588234870784 2018-03-01 06:29:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @AP4Liberty @Guntalk @AvrilMai91 @DeepStateAgent2 The meme that says it all.
969458766977658880 2018-03-01 06:25:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @AP4Liberty @Guntalk @AvrilMai91 One good thing in November, being supported by the Missouri Firearms Coalition and talking like an NRA acolyte will be a nice liability. Couldn't happen to a better (meaning worst) candidate.
969455535941615616 2018-03-01 06:13:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @AP4Liberty I find libertarians vaguely annoying because they live in a bubble separate from reality. But when you start waving the 2nd Amendment around without reading or understanding it then you move beyond vaguely annoying to totally annoying. Sit down and be quiet.
969453154843717632 2018-03-01 06:03:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @AP4Liberty @wallen48 @RobbyTheremin I guess progress is in the eye of the beholder. Missouri like our nation is currently undergoing a regressive phase but we will save it. Thank heavens Hawley will be a distant memory and Claire will continue to stand for Missouri and America!
969452299440525312 2018-03-01 06:00:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepMarkMeadows @Biochic2018 Don't you people ever research and report facts instead of lies?
969447237460914177 2018-03-01 05:40:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @BradMossEsq That's odd. I could have sworn yesterday 45* supported gun control and suggested trampling on due process. And last year he signed off on mentally ill people having access to your favorite modern assault rifle. Is it possible that this president has schizophrenic tendencies?
969425895051218944 2018-03-01 04:15:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @DLoesch @SaysHummingbird @RachelleBronson @BrettSula1 The same thought crossed my mind. Is there a leash? And is the other end of the leash in the hands of her owner (the NRA)?
969414516239994881 2018-03-01 03:30:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepMarkMeadows So sorry North Carolina; sounds like you got stuck with a bad rep too. I have Ann Wagner, trump lackey extraordinaire.
969405662198452224 2018-03-01 02:54:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @jbarro @deplorkibble Only if you are taking a three day Carnival cruise maybe. Otherwise I assume you havent cruised recently.
969364457863503874 2018-03-01 00:11:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @TomiLahren And are you aware it was designed for the military, Miss Clueless?
969281600637800448 2018-03-01 18:41:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @KerryForChoice @fhayesmccoy @fionsars From an American woman-well said and from the heart. Thank you.
969230936616423424 2018-03-01 15:20:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @TIME @TimmyMcTitties Excuse me but what does little kids raffling off an assault-style weapon originally created for the military have to do with the 2nd Amendment?
969209241646051329 2018-03-01 13:54:24 UTC <sally_dehner> Thank you, thank you for saying publicly and eloquently what I firmly believe.https://twitter.com/johnpavlovitz/status/969202581783371777
969207019264708609 2018-03-01 13:45:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @Native2ATX @RichardEngel This return to the past is going to be really hard for students-dividing their time between active shooter drills and nuclear attack drills. Throw on your coats America, the new Cold War is brutal.
969205826874478592 2018-03-01 13:40:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Hicks & Bannon demonstrate this administrations disdain for rules, law & reality. They think they can do whatever they want with no responsibility to America. If Mueller does nothing else he should puncture that little bubble they are playing in.
969204569313087488 2018-03-01 13:35:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily @jonpaton4 EVERYONE considering coming to the US should take notice. And to fellow Americans I say, See! We told you electing this man would ruin our country for decades. Even after 45* resigns, our courts will still be tainted.
969051459043184640 2018-02-28 03:27:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @BobinHB @keithboykin Wow, I didnt know I had such influence on Walmart! 
969050997057310720 2018-02-28 03:25:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @marcorubio @GrainOfSands @heartofmel @melaniesdavis @iSenseChange @dutchiegirlie @jeannefisher17 November 2018-having an A rating from the NRA is going to be a big political liability.
969038406918557698 2018-02-28 02:35:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @jbarro @deplorkibble Not true. Some seniors are on fixed incomes, but theres a large percentage that are the last of the pension retirees plus some had 401Ks. They are the ones traveling in retirement. Look at the cruise industry. They try to entice younger people but their demo skews older.
969005489399980032 2018-02-28 00:24:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @johnrutledge When people tweet that trump knows what he's doing, I know they've been brainwashed. I think trump is being manipulated like one of those coin operated carnival claw games. It's really sad.
968999604787273728 2018-02-28 00:01:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP If he was such a great choice, why did you have to break a tie? Sounds like not such a great choice to me.
968907762863366145 2018-02-28 17:56:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @johnrutledge Im pretty sure this is fake but firmly based on one of her fathers speeches.
968893269387173888 2018-02-28 16:58:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Another wonderful ad from the fun-loving company called Vista Outdoorpic.twitter.com/53AUFTQGnr
968892932043542529 2018-02-28 16:57:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Vista Outdoor sounds like such a fun, innocuous company.pic.twitter.com/J3IrOk7Go7
968873493474480128 2018-02-28 15:40:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @Brasilmagic As a woman, the phrase about alpha males being back, tells me all I need to know about the size of his equipment.
968867095734902786 2018-02-28 15:14:50 UTC <sally_dehner> So thats the sanitized name for guns like an AR-15? Modern sporting rifle? Glad you cleared that up. Not very sporting to me but then Im a true 2nd Amendment believer.https://twitter.com/baseman2001/status/968826704260227073
968863869312565248 2018-02-28 15:02:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @BobinHB @keithboykin Okay, here is a shout out to some other stores - Rural King, Farm and Home, Buchheits. And WalMart?? Will you all pledge to do the same?
968861622134542337 2018-02-28 14:53:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @JoyAnnReid @TexasArmyChris And FedEx will give you a nice discount to use their shipping. See, this is what is wrong with our nation and its excessive love of inappropriate weapons.
968855872318464000 2018-02-28 14:30:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @funder Jared and Ivanka should just be invited over to the WH for occasional family dinners. That is the only WH relationship they should have, period.
968850437582610433 2018-02-28 14:08:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @libshipwreck And I bet there will be money to fund those things yet no money for student supplies, teacher salaries, increased staffing (except for armed guards), building improvements (except for those new doors and windows). That is why we know politicians like Scott are full of it.
968695823491051526 2018-02-27 03:54:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @davidhogg111 @NRO @JasonKander I think David found himself thrust into the debate by circumstances. That said, I believe we all have a right to be part of a national debate on gun policy. If Conservatives don't like our input, that's tough.
968694784549376000 2018-02-27 03:50:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @JohnsonHildy @NRO Just love the idea that FedEx thinks being a gun owner/lover is worthy of a special discount. *sarcasm*
968691638540423168 2018-02-27 03:37:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @Lena38Baker @CollinRugg @patriotchris03 Good Lord, get off your tush & go do something constructive, Patriot Chris. We've heard this bs from your kind over & over. The smell of flop sweat is strong off the WH. The FBI, Clinton, Schumer, Waters are all just fine because they know they are on the right side of history.
968626945826181121 2018-02-27 23:20:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @mcspocky Whoa, smartgirls4GOP? Or miserable troll using ESL.
968602535534776323 2018-02-27 21:43:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @RedaMor_ @UseYourMorals Sorry but in a democracy we are entitled to speak out against any politician doing wrong by our nation and to work for the recall, impeachment or defeat of said politician. If you dont like it you are free to leave anytime.
968570496232185856 2018-02-27 19:36:16 UTC <sally_dehner> Ive always thought the picture of him sheltering himself under an umbrella & leaving his son to walk behind him in the rain was a perfect symbol of the sort of man, father & president he is.

968489888453660672 2018-02-27 14:15:57 UTC <sally_dehner> I guess the NRA reminded him who's the boss.https://twitter.com/SafetyPinDaily/status/968488540299497473
968482834917871616 2018-02-27 13:47:56 UTC <sally_dehner> Thank heavens there is still humor in our world. By humor I mean the idea that our president would run through fleeing children into a school building to tackle an active shooter.    
968347229344890881 2018-02-26 04:49:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenatorHeitkamp @Jasonwaldvogel1 Or you might be a Libertarian. They all live in the most intriguing bubble of non-reality.
968346882589253633 2018-02-26 04:47:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenatorHeitkamp @Jasonwaldvogel1 So you don't believe businesses should share profits with the people that make those profits possible? What a Republican viewpoint!
968346357827342337 2018-02-26 04:45:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenatorHeitkamp @Jasonwaldvogel1 And by those opinions you demonstrate you are a ....Republican. Half-truths, outright lies and insinuations.
968307713838059520 2018-02-26 02:12:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenatorHeitkamp @Jasonwaldvogel1 Literally every time they've forced a raise in minimum wage while the Republicans moaned & groaned. Their ongoing support of unions & their hamstringing of the right-to-work for less group. Their support for safety laws that protect American citizens.
968300026303799296 2018-02-26 01:41:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @Apple @Google @amazon @FedEx @aravosis This makes me wonder what other sorts of organizations you may be giving discounts to.
968299456167923712 2018-02-26 01:39:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @10NewsWTSP @CNN @dan_liva Not a surprise that gun lovers see the handwriting on the wall. "O Lord, in the future someone's actually gonna background check me! Domestic abuse record? My mental health status? What if I need a license & insurance, how I'm gonna afford that? And no more AR-15's...sob."
968297320642220032 2018-02-26 01:30:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @FedEx No one asked you to deny service to anyone. I would like to know why having a gun gets a discount? Where is my discount as a citizen who believes in stricter gun control and safety rules? I really will try to avoid using FedEx, especially after this misleading statement.
968296101521580034 2018-02-26 01:25:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenatorHeitkamp @Jasonwaldvogel1 Re: question of when have Democrats been in favor of giving back to the working class the answer would be when were Republicans ever on the working man's side? Reagan and his union busting, trickle down disaster? Vote blue if you are a working person and want to be respected.
968295160256876544 2018-02-26 01:22:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenatorHeitkamp @Jasonwaldvogel1 Barely 50% of workers have 401Ks. A decent salary and a pension would be a lot more valuable. Most workers have less than $100,000 and many have less than $20,000. Read history to see how this was one more way for corporations to save money at the expense of workers.
968179226884165633 2018-02-26 17:41:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @Ld00d What a dilemma! One part of me says,  Ive so got to tweet this . The other says, Brian never retweets when asked, I should be like Brian. I must follow this person.

968123739656327169 2018-02-26 14:01:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @ConcrndCitizen3 @mcspocky My thought is Democrats & Independents are just watching the Republican Party implode & will wait til after 2018 to choose a good candidate. Why waste money right now when there is no legitimate person to oppose; that person is taking themselves (& Republicans) out of the race.
967997485661786112 2018-02-25 05:39:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @funder Question here-this money trump is raising, where will it go? We know that this 35% approval rating president with a special investigator on his tail is not going to be a candidate in 2020 so what happens to the shills campaign money?
967740658076266496 2018-02-25 12:38:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @goodoldcatchy @wesley_jordan I understand the philosophy behind that interpretation of 2A but I never worried about my government becoming a life-threatening, out of control entity until trump.

967627615472377857 2018-02-24 05:09:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @nytimes I am relieved that companies whose services I like to use have stepped up & disavowed their relationship with the NRA & it's members.  I don't spend money with companies that support things I'm against.  Why should someone who owns weapons get a discount on car rental anyway?
967625439966564352 2018-02-24 05:00:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @BradMossEsq Torpedoes hitting trump?  No dear, it's those tweets. His own words never miss their target, shooting himself in the foot every morning like clockwork.
967624695402115072 2018-02-24 04:57:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @Emma4Change @davidhogg111 @atDavidHoffman And the NRA and the CPAC wonder why sane, upstanding Americans are disgusted with their whole "holier than thou, it's my 2A right" charade. How disappointing that Amazon would ever sell something this despicable.
967620514775695360 2018-02-24 04:41:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @united Thank you United for doing the right thing.  I applaud your stance and admire your courage for making this decision.
967590696323608577 2018-02-24 02:42:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @DLoesch @SaysHummingbird @bonnieherchik Had to click on the meme to see if #4 had a qualifier because frankly the world knows that the low information voter, the one-issue voter, the 2A I want my weapons voter, the I don't want big government unless they give my business a tax break voter, those voters are Republicans.
967589357489147904 2018-02-24 02:37:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @DLoesch @SaysHummingbird @addie_1122 I agree with you Tom.  I think Ms. Loesch has anger management issues.  There are classes to help her with that.
967588888171761665 2018-02-24 02:35:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @DLoesch @SaysHummingbird May I state the obvious?  Ms. Loesch, you piss me off.  Well, glad to get that off my chest.
967572052369641472 2018-02-24 01:28:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alyssa_Milano It is disgusting how this group crows patriotism while refusing to heed the fact that the majority of Americans want stricter gun control. The NRA has duped it's members into thinking it stands for them; in reality it is a gun manufacturing lobby that feeds members a fairytale.
967553459670175744 2018-02-24 00:14:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @NRATV @USPS @amazon @eBay @davidhogg111 @___jon I am sorry to say that those millions of NRA members have been duped. You think they represent and support you? No, they are a gun manufacturing lobbyists and getting your money and your indignation for the cause is icing on the cake. Frankly LaPierre is a piece of pond scum.

Totally impressed! But they dont need to pay me. I do the right thing for free. BTW, didnt you want to remind me about my check due from Mr. Soros as well? Hysterical !

Dont you get it? Were fed up with the NRA & their fake cries of 2A, 2A. In the spirit of 2A we need sensible gun control, & we need it now.  Dont care @ the age of those leading the fight.
967201877107539968 2018-02-23 00:57:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @dherman001 Then why would you ever need to open or conceal carry on a day to day basis in everyday life? Are you defending yourself from government overreach at Denny's?
967196473384415232 2018-02-23 00:36:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @SusResister @Kath120354 @tommyzax Maybe you can't admit that youth speaking out with the support of like-minded adults just blew-up the NRA perk system and showed companies that allying themselves with the gun lobby was a bad idea.
967194768345305088 2018-02-23 00:29:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @SusResister @tommyzax It is a perk of being an NRA member, getting discounts and a special credit card. The point is we don't think people that push the idea that weapons, especially ones originally designed for the military, should be had for the asking & carried everywhere, should be getting perks.

966753844788125696 2018-02-22 19:17:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing When Meghan McCain lifts up Dana Loesch as a friend and thinks she was badly treated at the townhall, Ms. McCain loses my respect. I would choose my friends more carefully.

966740889224826880 2018-02-22 18:26:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @davidaxelrod @ChrisMears00 Arrested him for what? For owning an arsenal of weapons? I thought that was okay with most of you. Arrested him for having mental health issues? Under what law? It could have been fixed by stricter gun laws but people commenting here dont want that. You are all complicit.
966739411256987648 2018-02-22 18:20:11 UTC <sally_dehner> Talking about the Broward sheriff, just exactly what did he have to stop the shooter? He had no law that would forbid the shooter from buying a weapon that would be used to kill 17 people. What mental health help is there? Law enforcement could not follow him around 24/7. https://twitter.com/semperfi_2017/status/966544494786117632
966715225528590336 2018-02-22 16:44:05 UTC <sally_dehner> Did anyone else notice that the students in Parkland seem to be more intelligent and have a better vocabulary and speaking style than the so-called leader of the free world? Very sad.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/966653833047887874
966316282718179328 2018-02-21 14:18:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @JasonKander Those are things the majority of citizens have advocated all along. But that may be too little, too late. I don't think the Parkland kids are going to be content with half-measures. The gun lobby has waited too long and gone too far. The pushback is going to be strong.

965999134472921089 2018-02-20 17:18:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @mike_Zollo @Alawnguy Russian troll is your signature?? Or are you projecting again?  You are a Russian troll? I should have guessed.
965986225529282560 2018-02-20 16:27:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @mike_Zollo @Alawnguy Did you ever hear the term projection? A psychological theory in which someone defends themselves by denying their faults and projecting them on to others. Idiot? Do you have a mirror handy? Thanks for the laugh, although this blindness in trump supporters is destroying America.

965935843264421888 2018-02-20 13:07:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @Pajjr2016 Good point.
965802510916218880 2018-02-19 04:17:17 UTC <sally_dehner> I just blocked someone called @general_covfefe I checked his site to see if he should be reported (I found him rather scary) but I think he's just deluded and full of orange kool-aid.
965801772097900544 2018-02-19 04:14:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @nicky_skinz Boy you are really off your rocker.  I think for my safety I will block you.
965801319599570944 2018-02-19 04:12:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @APCentralRegion @MarlaMg1 I believe God is everywhere.  Is your god so weak that he was kept out of schools?  I bet there were a lot of prayers in Parkland the other day.  But school mandated prayer?  That needed to go.  Public schools are not the place for particular religions to lead prayers.
965799518578139136 2018-02-19 04:05:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenBlumenthal Thank God.  I hope this is the first step on a new pathway to sensible gun laws.
965798922475266048 2018-02-19 04:03:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @mike_Zollo @Alawnguy Honey, the Russians are already here.  Didn't you see them all at the Prayer Breakfast?
965798643520372737 2018-02-19 04:01:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @nicky_skinz I doubt they have much to fear, the AR-15's are all in the hands of their supporters.  No, they just shoot themselves in the foot.  November 2018 is going to be beautiful.
965798226577297408 2018-02-19 04:00:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @nicky_skinz Wow, five excuses for this congressman to be a jerk & a coward.  If it works for you that is fine; he's not my congressman. I live in Missouri, I have crappy ones of my own (Senator {doesn't know where MO is} Blunt & Congressperson Annie {I love my lobbyists} Wagner).
965796421105483776 2018-02-19 03:53:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @mike_Zollo Seriously Mike, let it go.  You can make your outlandish claims but we know you are whistling in the dark.  #TrumpColluded We know it, Mr. Mueller knows it and deep down you know it too.
965794893191942144 2018-02-19 03:47:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @nicky_skinz It is my experience that the majority in Congress are frightened of their constituents as well as citizens in general.  This is why they won't face us. Why is that?  Well in some (maybe most) instances, they are not actually voting in our best interests.
965794447450615808 2018-02-19 03:45:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @nicky_skinz I am going to take issue with this comment relating to constituents.  Yes Congresspeople are elected by people in their district, but when they are sitting in Congress they are making decisions that impact all of us.  We have the right to be heard on the issues.

Gaming the system is what some people live for. Sad that those sorts of people are now controlling our government. So what do you do when you catch someone cheating in The Game of Life?
965596428369383425 2018-02-19 14:38:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @tngsmama @omgitsjfizzy Actually the more I see and hear of this administration and their sleazy, illegal acts the more I wonder, is Hillary Clinton the real president and 45* an illegal usurper?

965410453085188096 2018-02-18 02:19:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @JatikaSpeaks @ProperOpinion I would say that having 17 of your classmates & teachers die around you gives you experience that most of us dont have. Perhaps the wisdom is created in the cauldron of fear. Then through social media they will spread that experience & wisdom to others. #never again #WeCallBS
965313024658694145 2018-02-18 19:52:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @USvs45 @IronStache There is an easy fix to Mr. Pruitts problem. Start taking care of the environment (like your job description calls for) and you will never have to fear ordinary citizens again. Problem solved & taxpayer money saved!

964998746860937216 2018-02-17 23:03:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly Gotta love (failed) Trump Vodka; from a man who never drinks. He claimed during a 2006 interview with Larry King that all the profits from his namesake vodka would "go to various studies on alcoholism and everything else."  Yeah, right.

964630857662255106 2018-02-16 22:41:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @libshipwreck Thank you for the comfort cats.
964628758379552770 2018-02-16 22:33:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers Laura Ingraham needs to remember that when she points a finger, three are pointing back at her. Hypocrisy 101: running your mouth off asking why other people have to run their mouth off. There is dribbling on the court & then there is your dribbling on Fox.

964507636866670593 2018-02-16 14:31:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepMarkMeadows @ScottVanderson6 Uh, Republicans in control, remember? You have the majority, quit bitchin and just a grammar point: double negative is a positive. Therefore, thanks to Dems we are acvomplising something!
964504190499414016 2018-02-16 14:18:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @DearAuntCrabby When trump said hed drain the swamp he was planning to install a cesspool. A cesspool that he filled with all the best people.
964503320089038850 2018-02-16 14:14:45 UTC <sally_dehner> Someone will probably tweet that I have no respect for the office of president and they will block me. That is alright; this tweet made me wince and laugh. Thanks Aunt Crabby.https://twitter.com/dearauntcrabby/status/964152145816838144
964502065887301632 2018-02-16 14:09:46 UTC <sally_dehner> I believe the students that survived the horror of this massacre may end up being the leaders to help us break the back of the gun worship that holds us hostage.https://twitter.com/nikta04/status/964339827918409728

This country is in real danger right now from these people.  November can't come fast enough!
964387220424613888 2018-02-15 06:33:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @OregonJOBS2 My dad was handicapped and used a walker back in the 60's when there was no concern for handicapped accessibility. Having special parking spaces would have been so helpful for him.  I hate seeing something like this.
964386570424823808 2018-02-15 06:30:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @OregonJOBS2 There are always going to be some people that break the rules so maybe we shouldn't bother with handicapped parking spaces. I'm sorry, I'm snippy tonight because I've been reading too much bilge about how stricter gun laws will never work because people always break the law.
964384409146159106 2018-02-15 06:22:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @Adaripp @blueshot007 When it comes to Pence and 45* I like to quote Psalm 109:8 ESV.
964323201563156480 2018-02-15 02:19:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @SaysHummingbird I assume that the Secret Service is worried that someone in the trump base may have woken up & realized they were a victim of a con artist.  And since the trump base seems to love guns & the NRA, having someone present at this forum who now has an agenda could be very dangerous.
964201686628753410 2018-02-15 18:16:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @johnrutledge I pray you are right John. I would throw in a little money laundering too.

964183260392841216 2018-02-15 17:02:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @PressSec Minimum wage is not even a living wage and frankly each of the companies you all tout could have & should have done this a long time ago based on their profits. The tax scam was out & out bribery-big gift to corporations, pittance for employees.
964029508255969280 2018-02-14 06:52:00 UTC <sally_dehner> Important reading material. Notice Blunt is not mentioned-perhaps he had the sense to not open his mouth?https://twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/964026888674074624
964028112953634816 2018-02-14 06:46:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @EricBoehlert Exactly why NRA invested so heavily in trump. They couldn't have a president that wasn't on "their" side.
964012103056191489 2018-02-14 05:42:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @Montel_Williams @trueholygoat You think stricter gun control measures (which Florida totally lacks) would damage the 2nd Amendment? Have you actually read the second amendment? Could you tell us about being in the militia? What national enemy are you fighting?  Does open/conceal carry make the militia better?
963781243652501504 2018-02-14 14:25:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @Ancientbob @TheRickWilson Aha! "Trump feels like a foreign invader" exactly describes what I've been experiencing. Thank you @robertscribbler
963776858662883329 2018-02-14 14:08:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @JamesThompsonKS @andreabakes Good list. I would add true immigration reform and path to citizenship for the Dreamers plus the elimination of Citizens United.

963767857548013570 2018-02-14 13:32:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @ChuckGrassley @tweets1959 You should have listened to Hillary Clinton during the debates. She told you the TRUTH about trump. You refused to listen & now you reap the disaster sown. 45* is not a demon, just a morally bankrupt man who has been unleashed on our nation with the help of Russia & deplorables.
963764270377979905 2018-02-14 13:18:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @ChuckGrassley @tweets1959 Oh dear. I thought you were just a misguided trumper & I have seen quite a few of them on Twitter. But by this post, I see you are a bit beyond the pale & need more help than just a cursory explanation of the truth. My thoughts & prayers are with you.
963634839726579715 2018-02-13 04:43:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @ChuckGrassley @tweets1959 Actually it is the Republicans who do not truly care about Americans and they are working hard to make sure they maintain their power to hide their corruption. I would not give you a nickel for a single Republican in Congress right now. And dont get me started on the WH trash.
963218576915214343 2018-02-12 01:09:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @ILuvBeingWhite @ARmastrangelo You forgot to mention that they followed that laughter with this, "why did it take YOU so long to figure that out?"
963139839959986176 2018-02-12 19:56:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @jonathanalter This is why the 45* administration needs to vilify the FBI. Any entity that holds the truth against them must go. Literally no one is safe from their wrath. But the truth can not be denied.
963050135323365377 2018-02-12 14:00:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepMarkMeadows And remember this----45* & the Republican Congress starve and torture American citizens in a more subtle way.
963049280352276480 2018-02-12 13:56:55 UTC <sally_dehner> And I should mention the sight of an old white man taking away her microphone and then two old white men dragging her away. Wow, the symbolism of that scene is scary!
963043344682172419 2018-02-12 13:33:20 UTC <sally_dehner> Way to go! Calling out the truth about legislators on both sides of the aisle. Love her comment about 1 minute 45 seconds for citizens compared to booze filled parties where lobbyists preach.

I have several snarky comments at my fingertips but I will be kind and just give you a twitter pat on the head and say, what can you expect from a maga, tsk,tsk.
962896593971277824 2018-02-11 03:50:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @SLSmith000 Come on, this has got to be a spoof. Although I think Trumpy Bear has a better chance in 2020 than his namesake.
962577371680342017 2018-02-10 06:41:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @ckn4502 Paul Nehlen says he grew to know the grace of God. Looking at his page, he either speaks of a different God than I know or he out and out lies.
962525886359724032 2018-02-10 03:17:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @gummifaustus But a maga trumper would say, " we had the biggest crowd, bigger than Obama ever had when he and Michelle were competing. "

962402097357639683 2018-02-10 19:05:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @DonnaWR8 Did anybody else cringe while these pictures scrolled? The poster children for nepotism, bribery & all around incompetence. I believe women should have opportunities to demonstrate their abilities & intelligence but this rather wretched group are not good examples.
962376635365429248 2018-02-10 17:24:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag I agree. Many people didnt vote or voted for trump because they didnt like Hillary. That was the culmination of years of manipulated character assasination. They would have had a harder time pulling that on Biden.
962375420720140289 2018-02-10 17:19:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @docrocktex26 @realDonaldTrump @bill_auclair I remember an interview with Melania Trump where she talks about how upset he gets when things arent done to his satisfaction. Sounded like anger management issues to me.
962138316740194304 2018-02-09 01:37:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly So what they are saying is the Nunes memo had no classified or sensitive information, it was just basically made up, so that is why they released it. On the other hand the Democratic memo actually has correct & verifiable information therefore it must be suppressed. Okay, got it.
962104476483162117 2018-02-09 23:22:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @MrTommyCampbell It's obvious this is not a parade to honor our military but to humor a draft dodger. It's an opportunity for him to show off to the other dictators in the world. There are many ways to honor our military that do not require them to use manpower & defense funds on a stupid whim.
961969133876326400 2018-02-09 14:24:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @Brasilmagic I keep flip-flopping on who's the worst in the 45* cabinet. DeVos is worse, no it's Zinke, no Pruitt, no it's Sessions, it's Mnuchin. Then there's the second tier duds (under the radar) like Carson, Tillerson, Perry, Chao, Azar, Ross, Perdue. It's a perfect swamp in there.
961962278009692161 2018-02-09 13:57:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @FrancesRauer @thehill The motto for Fox should be "racist, fake, and stupid." Or perhaps this quote applies (amended), " those that can, do;  those that can't, work for Fox. "
961960440342474754 2018-02-09 13:50:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @The_UnSilent_ Any chance all of this is like the dream season of "Dallas"? I keep thinking I'll wake up one morning and discover everything is back to normal (i.e. we have a president who is hardworking, intelligent and we are once more a respected nation of the world.)
961955365507207168 2018-02-09 13:30:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @FaithCompassion @Education4Libs Stumbled on this page by accident. Sometimes it is good to read this kind of junk because it reminds those of us who resist why we need to do it. That people exist and spout this nonsense is worrying for the future of our country. Just a reminder-45* is not your friend.
961787591048744960 2018-02-08 02:23:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @thehill @Imperator_Rex3 Let's see.  Obama was not involved in a conspiracy (that is a creation in the minds of magas). Trump is managing to destroy himself & his presidency without any help from anyone.  The current WH & the total administration is indeed uncharted territory. Good Lord, you quote Gorka?
961786339044806656 2018-02-08 02:18:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @kylegriffin1 Did he really say that this administration is just another season of The Apprentice? 
961727187094261760 2018-02-08 22:23:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers What he said was right but the problem he doesn't believe those things or practice those things. Sad.
961726917954228224 2018-02-08 22:22:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @BetteMidler I know I probably shouldn't laugh but........LMAO.
961726685543587841 2018-02-08 22:21:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @HillaryClinton @BeebleZapp @SusResister @AfshinRi This is kind of scary, but I actually read several comments recently on Facebook from magas who said that things were fine now & we should enjoy it but Obama has it rigged because of his "weaponization of the economy" & things would go bad.  Proactive protection of the conman.
961649426820452352 2018-02-08 17:14:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @FBI @RogueNASA Thank you for all you do to keep America safe! You have our backs and we have yours.pic.twitter.com/VILS1YxVVI

961631904134057986 2018-02-08 16:04:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly I believe if a community comes together and asks that an immigrant, even when they came illegally, be allowed to stay, the community request should be honored.  This is why the trump version of immigration reform is wrong, wrong, wrong.
961486086710202368 2018-02-07 06:25:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @WriterJuneHur How well I remember the day the librarian let me check books off the adult shelf because I had read all the children's books the bookmobile had to offer.
961387959479042048 2018-02-07 23:55:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @t_matson @pot_meetkettle Sorry, if you are talking about trump, I see a man lining his own pockets,  a man willing to waste our tax dollars on a stupid parade (must love that Russian Mayday thing), a man who loves to golf & tweet stupidity. I see a man who destroys not builds. Temporary economic goals :(
961371928048041984 2018-02-07 22:51:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alyssa_Milano This is what happens when you make a self-centered, classless, clueless person the commander-in-chief.

The way the tax scam was handled was so dumb that half this stuff was never clear. I am relieved charitable deduct was left alone; was a concern to charities I am involved in. That was not made clear earlier. But in 2025??
961090234875248640 2018-02-06 04:12:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @pot_meetkettle @keyparty201x @t_matson It's a great thing but in this administration that hardly ever happens. In fact for the most part this administration chooses party, Russia, lobbyists, almost anything but the people. They seem to be blind & deaf if it doesn't put money in their pockets. As 45* would say, "sad."
961086951326670852 2018-02-06 03:59:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alt_FedEmployee This is why I feel so sorry for The Onion; there is no place left to go.

961085523212238849 2018-02-06 03:53:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @pot_meetkettle @keyparty201x @t_matson It's interesting, all the things you mention were not in the earlier versions of the tax scam. Is it possible someone (sure wouldn't be trump) woke up and said, "whoa, if we take all these things away, people are going to be seriously pissed we better stick some of these back." ?
961084394365767680 2018-02-06 03:49:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @t_matson @pot_meetkettle Oh honey, there isn't enough time in the day to demonstrate to people like you what a mistake you made getting on the Trump train. Oh well, down the line when you run off the rails, we'll just shrug and say "told you so :)"
961083722685669377 2018-02-06 03:46:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle I' m impressed you apparently read all 600 pages of the tax scam-good going. Did every page include a reminder that these items expire in 2025?
961069909399736320 2018-02-06 02:51:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle And all that disappears what year? It's a true scam but people will fall for con artists everytime.
960982387449565185 2018-02-06 21:03:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle Yes I can see the handwriting on the wall. Slightly bigger checks will help the Republicans at the polls and then when April 2019 comes-whoops, too late, you made your bed, too bad the bedspread was full of holes.
960963602114113536 2018-02-06 19:49:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle As Ive said, this is not a normal presidency. All rationality is out the window. To say I dislike this president is the biggest understatement ever.
960962977607364608 2018-02-06 19:46:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle You are assuming a normal presidency which we havent got. 45* will do as he pleases & the Republican sheep will smile & chew their cud. There is a questionable R agenda out there & the Democrats are locked out of any rational decisions. November!
960950816944410630 2018-02-06 18:58:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle Trump cant touch OSHA? Its a part of the Federal Government. Its under the Secretary of Labor which position is currently unfilled. Ordinarily we could depend on our checks and balances but right now? I dont feel good about that.
960928184261890050 2018-02-06 17:28:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle Dont you mean trumps rollback of environmental, health & safety regulations? I guess you think Scott Pruitt is doing a fantastic job as head of EPA (now known as the office for corporate protection). Of course we cant forget Ryan Zinke who sees our parks as mining ops.
960923757836750848 2018-02-06 17:10:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle Suggest you take a look at the coal industry and the oil pipelines as two examples. Regulations protect us, the land and the workers. For corporations, regulations detract from their bottom line.
960919232790827008 2018-02-06 16:52:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle America is "we, the people" so when corporations threaten the health and welfare of this nation and her people, regulations MUST be put into place. You call it letting private companies run their business, I call it keeping them honest and our country safe.
960914507693547520 2018-02-06 16:34:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle Corporations indeed love the lifting of regulations; it makes them giddy. Why were those regulations in place? A law is laid down because someone cheats-air pollution, water pollution, unsafe workplace, banking misrule, etc. Those regulations business abhors were our protection.
960904117127442432 2018-02-06 15:52:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle Just like I said-the market will always have corrections. My 401K was a lot better under Obama than under Bush; how it does under 45* remains to be seen. Eliminating regulations is definitely a love gift to corporations but not so much to ordinary citizens.
960880205144449024 2018-02-06 14:17:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tombx7M @keyparty201x @pot_meetkettle Hope your 401K was diversified and you are not crying after yesterday. The market correction was bound to happen and 45* will blame it on Obama; two things as certain as death and taxes.
960879316040060928 2018-02-06 14:14:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @pot_meetkettle @Tombx7M @keyparty201x Mr. Stein is a perfect example of why Republicans are so screwed up. He admits in this article that Hillary Clinton was the better choice, more balanced, more intelligent then says he's going to vote for the man who knows nothing about economics. Sheesh, that was dumb.
960517709296472064 2018-02-05 14:17:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @RepAdamSchiff @johnlundin @alshabob2 Schiff for brains or trump for brains? Reading your feed Bill Brown, it's obvious you chose wrong.
959846981328953344 2018-02-03 17:52:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell @JohnWUSMC @DuBois_V_2018 @RodWilkinsRF When it comes to butt kicking & name taking we know who will be spending time in prison. We are going to dance in the streets as 45* is marched out of the WH. Then you will know what that asterisk stands for in the history books. *currently serving time in prison.
959843921747677185 2018-02-03 17:39:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @PRyan @art_steal @AndrewLowman858 But she cant do a Hulu upgrade AND a Costco membership. There are raises and then real raises.
959840486143021059 2018-02-03 17:26:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Sir, with all due respect, Carter Page was under surveillance as a possible Russian agent since 2013. Why would you choose to make him a part of your campaign? What were you thinking? Did you literally not vet him or did you have a more nefarious reason for hiring him?
959789183375151105 2018-02-03 14:02:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @Jim_Jordan Sir, if this is your take on what has happened and is happening in our nation right now, you really should not be in our Congress. It frightens me to think someone so clueless is making decisions for our nation that seriously impact me and my family. Please resign NOW.
959589676146446336 2018-02-02 00:49:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @PeterAlexander @SarahCoates921 Sorry but telling me Trey Gowdy read the application and reported back to the group does not fill me with confidence that this memo is based on reality.
959543373873938432 2018-02-02 21:45:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @chuckwoolery @AnnCoulter @Alt_FedEmployee @kurteichenwald Holy cow, since when is the former host of The Love Connection some sort of conservative pundit? I totally missed this! I am literally falling off my chair laughing. I read his stuff & laughed harder. Someone better warn him of the Trump undertow; it pulls suckers like him in.
959523554193805312 2018-02-02 20:26:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @SocialPowerOne1 The Onion? No?? Really??
959509891445608448 2018-02-02 19:32:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @maxbergmann @igorvolsky Very impressive. When trump put Carter Page into his campaign as an advisor, jaws all over the FBI must have dropped. What idiot puts a suspected Russian agent on staff? One of 2 reasons-either you are not very bright or you are conspiring with Russia.
959503266374709255 2018-02-02 19:06:20 UTC <sally_dehner> If only I knew how to make this into a meme. I must follow you now so I dont miss any other insights :)
959502352477769728 2018-02-02 19:02:42 UTC <sally_dehner> This comment is hands down the perfect image and my favorite.https://twitter.com/chicomaki1/status/959486159389888513
959500587791462401 2018-02-02 18:55:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @jonfavs I believe the Nunes memo is chickenshit. What Dems, Independents, every true patriot is DEMANDING is that the Mueller investigation be continued. Every person of interest, including 45*, should testify under oath. When & only when this investigation is finished will we sit down.
959155385218338817 2018-02-01 20:03:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tamaraw68415067 @washingtonpost @jba437 Petersen & his fellow believers are what I call Libertarian knickknacks. You know those things you think you just have to have but when you get them home you realize they are useless, have no place in your life & are easily broken. You end up wondering, What was I thinking!!?
959153651209134081 2018-02-01 19:57:05 UTC <sally_dehner> This is why our country is so messed up right now. Constant lies and innuendo from what many believe to actually be a news source. Fox News is the Trump of broadcasting, unable to go 5 minutes without lying.https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/958784699895181312
959149065299734529 2018-02-01 19:38:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis Would those be private schools; perhaps run by some of those administration friends?
959122702509510656 2018-02-01 17:54:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @jba437 @AP4Liberty You could beat Claire if you dont say stupid things & dont offer a platform that is full of useless Libertarian knickknacks.  So tired of all the anti-regulation stupidity & acting like doing your own thing makes everything okay. I admire Claire, libertarians, not so much.
959121468771758081 2018-02-01 17:49:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @Tamaraw68415067 @washingtonpost @jba437 Checked his platform more thoroughly & I repeat my no stream & underline it. Well at least hes against the useless, expensive wall. Other than that it is the same old Libertarian soap bubbles. Deep six regulations, Obamacare stinks but no viable alternative etc., etc., NO!

958863142322360321 2018-01-31 00:42:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepMarkMeadows @draaag1 Not wanting to burst your patriotic bubble but I've never seen a state of the union speech cheapened by using it as a campaign fundraiser either. Despicable.
958724854555054080 2018-01-31 15:33:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepMarciaFudge Representative Fudge, you are one of the women I admire and pay attention to in Congress. Your constituents are lucky to have you working for them. I would trade my Rep for you in a second. Heres to a great meeting at your town hall.
958574194689740800 2018-01-30 05:34:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @OnVegasTime JudyK @onvegastime blocked me. Another trumpet who retreats to her safe space because she cant really defend either her stance or the person she idolizes. When your idol has feet of clay (with bone spurs) and no sense of morality its best to just step back and be quiet.
958546304183029760 2018-01-30 03:43:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @cortvo I boycotted the speech but did you just say 80 minutes?? That had to rate as cruel and unusual punishment.
958526633757085697 2018-01-30 02:25:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @DevinNunes @RedTRaccoon @michaelwisniew1 @dewright_ca It is sad when a person reveals in their comment that they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. Research and fact-finding is your friend. Try it, you'll like it.
958519030901563392 2018-01-30 01:55:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @deaconseps @thehill Just a friendly flyby for Russia to say thanks for ignoring Congress and refusing to enact sanctions. We love you Trump!
958437052672086017 2018-01-30 20:29:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @nbc @howardfineman @EdKrassen Sounds like 45* thinks hes in a strong position right now re: Mueller. Doesnt anyone in the WH dare tell him the truth?
958436358246338562 2018-01-30 20:26:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @ErnestLamonica Since the GOP wrote the book on rude political discourse & how to divide our country, they are in no position to speak. Since 45* uses every presidential opportunity to fundraise for his next campaign, this complaint is hypocrisy. I look forward to Bryces comments on the SOTU.
958432091720552448 2018-01-30 20:09:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepGosar What about illegally elected politicians, can they be arrested? And what about members of Congress who pledge to represent their constituents but actually vote on behalf of lobbyists; Id like all of them arrested. Whoops, no speech and not much of an audience.
958416804866613248 2018-01-30 19:09:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @OnVegasTime Care to share who these couple long time Ds are that voted for 45*? Illegals & dead people-proven false plus many illegal votes turned out to be by Rs so thats why they knew about the issue. Trump* supporters-so easily proven wrong; its the fake news reports that mess you up.
958382174985703426 2018-01-30 16:51:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Good and bad. Bad-They think their money trumps our right to be heard. Good-they must be really scared of the blue wave 
958381002128265218 2018-01-30 16:46:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @OnVegasTime These are my last words on 45*: I have heard what this man says, I have seen what he does, I see the people he surrounds himself with & Ive read supporters comments. Because of this I know Im right to resist him.
958211364153110528 2018-01-29 05:32:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @MissouriRising Sorry Missouri Rising, we know you for what you are; dark money and even darker motives.  I love Claire and I so wish Hillary was president right now.  Imagine a SOTU speech you could listen to with pride.  Oh well, it's cat videos for me tomorrow night.
958210880235327490 2018-01-29 05:30:51 UTC <sally_dehner> These kind of dark money pacs are exactly what is wrong with our country right now.https://twitter.com/mmeyerdc/status/957008002279714818
958209356255907840 2018-01-29 05:24:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @OnVegasTime Poor Judy, methinks you protest too much.  Of course the marchers weren't trump supporters, they're too smart.  Democrats turning Republican?  Whoa, you have that backwards.  Under trump you are in bizarro world.  Remember 2,865,075? That's how much he lost by.  Never forget.
958065071330091008 2018-01-29 19:51:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @OnVegasTime Maybe you should ask one of the millions and millions who marched the other day and think about all the other resisters who didnt but supported in spirit. Open your eyes-the Resistance is growing everyday. Pretty soon 45* supporters will be able to meet in a walk/in closet.
957977835771179008 2018-01-29 14:04:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @OnVegasTime You stand with this president? Then you stand on the wrong side of history. We will try not to say "told you so" in the future.
957827505909567488 2018-01-28 04:07:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @OnVegasTime Okay I gave it some thought.  Here's a question for you.  How is your 401K?  Have you diversified your investments?  And how do you think 45* will spin the next market correction?  You know he'll blame it on Obama.  The blindness of the right is so sad.
957826532776513536 2018-01-28 04:03:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @OnVegasTime Laughing too hard to give you a coherent reply.pic.twitter.com/OQ0KVZQgxC

Dont really care if shes having an affair, not particularly impressed with her politics but you know the worst? When I read the comments here and see whos telling me how great she is, I end up thinking whoa, I need to steer clear of this woman.

957071606060339200 2018-01-26 02:03:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @OregonJOBS2 @Bender0917 I just dont like trump taking credit for Obamas successes. Of course we know sooner or later we will have a market correction (bet trump will suddenly blame THAT on Obama) but the real issue is the phony belief about job creation & the real hit many will be taking on medical.
957027890721427456 2018-01-26 23:10:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @OregonJOBS2 @Bender0917 The excellent one Oregon I.T. posted explaining how misguided trump supporters are confused about how the economy works.
957022688257638401 2018-01-26 22:49:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @OregonJOBS2 @Bender0917 Wow, you looked at that meme and thought it showed trump winning?? This is why so many of us shake our heads and chuckle. It probably will take most of his 4 years for 45* to reset us to the Bush era but hes certainly making progress. Lost jobs, less medical care, tax scam, sad.
957019187788025858 2018-01-26 22:35:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei Sounds like a typical trump speech. If there had been no lies or shaded truth we would be guessing the WH sent an imposter.

956761995956576258 2018-01-25 05:33:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @NikkiKing6778 Actually we are beginning to look like a third world dictatorship but that is due to 45* and cohorts not because of any immigrant illegal or not. If it sounds like a banana republic, is organized like a banana republic, well it just might be a republic.

956558524678582273 2018-01-25 16:04:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @EricLiptonNYT Methinks they protest too much. When you have to point out how good you are doing, then you probably arent.

956322633875943424 2018-01-24 00:27:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @SallyForTrump I am offended we have the same name.  No one who shares the name Sally should be as gullible as you are.  Sally and Trump in the same line, yuck.
956321840909123592 2018-01-24 00:24:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily It amazes me this man is still serving (and I use that term loosely) in Congress.  We must start vetting these people more carefully.  Look what happened when we didn't vet our current president more carefully.
956320567552040962 2018-01-24 00:19:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @amyinthelou @Everytown Donald Trump, that is a lie.  You are not with them.  You, your administration and every congressperson who takes money from the NRA are helping facilitate the killing.  You could do something to help but you won't.  YOU are complicit in murder!
956318294046380032 2018-01-24 00:10:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers Do none of these men ever listen to themselves?  How can they possibly believe the stupid things they say?  To Graham, Falwell, Perkins & the others "our thoughts and prayers are with you."  Try confession, it's good for the soul.

Not sure of the percentages of citizens from so-called shithole countries but yes I think our president was directing that comment to our people.  Even if he didn't use the term itself, his racist intent was clear.
956222581752893440 2018-01-24 17:50:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @1978dreamer @jsiterlet BTW Joe, I think you are confusing criticism of the Israeli government with anti-semitism; not the same thing at all.  Those nice 'Nazi" people Trump alluded to chant "Jews will not replace us."  I guess no Israel bashing meant?
956221410564825088 2018-01-24 17:45:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @1978dreamer @jsiterlet Really, Joe? Are you including our president?  I'm not actually sure who you would be speaking for.  P.S. Sorry, Charlie for hijacking your thread.
956202910412664833 2018-01-24 16:31:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 China has been supplying buses for Cuba; we rode in several of them recently. China seems to have their eye on a lot of markets. Trumpism known as maga is isolating us.
956202135141707776 2018-01-24 16:28:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @1978dreamer @jsiterlet Confused-liberals accused of anti-semitism yet they speak out against neo-Nazis while the right is lauded for being pro-Israel while insisting the neo-Nazis are good people. This has never computed for me; sort of like 2+2=5.
956199411763367936 2018-01-24 16:17:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @4everNeverTrump @Seinfelder Apparently you cant read. I will not insult you by suggesting you cant think or reason.

956193959486869506 2018-01-24 15:56:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @krassenstein @ReallyRealDonny I tweeted about conspiracy theories and you answered without even reading my tweet. Magic! Thanks for the reminder about stupidity versus conspiracy :)
956192955274072064 2018-01-24 15:52:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @krassenstein @DaleyBTCNews Ive always avoided being a conspiracy theorist but the fact that 45* was foisted on us has made me rethink the term. No one in their right mind could think trump was a good choice for prez yet here we are. Could that be the result of a conspiracy? See? Normality out the window!

So unless veterans are aiding police violence against people or espousing racism then they should applaud #TakeAKnee.

956173833853198336 2018-01-24 14:36:21 UTC <sally_dehner> Borrowed from a Facebook post-He (45*) is just trying to take us for a ride; Do NOT get in this vehicle.

955910005299073024 2018-01-23 21:07:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @funder I got that email & although I know no one ever reads responses because its just about the money, I took delight in having my say anyway. Ended with statement that 45* should read my words, hear the truth & quit listening to his coddling cohorts.
955906881754722305 2018-01-23 20:55:35 UTC <sally_dehner> I just posted this very comment on my Facebook page. Compassionate minds think alike. We know who loves and would offer more to our country.https://twitter.com/susannow3/status/955803312078708736

955173401764777987 2018-01-21 20:20:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Sorry but I think the Pence trip is useless grandstanding and a big waste of tax payer money. I guess we need Pence to do presidential things because the actor at home is clueless.

955152325383000064 2018-01-21 18:57:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @SecretaryZinke @AltYelloNatPark Interesting. Even a government shutdown was handled better during the Obama administration. This current group really cant do anything right. Will the door to Zinkes office door be left standing open during the shutdown & can we skip the personal flag thing?
954941409546686465 2018-01-20 04:59:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @PressSec Don't lie. This is the #TrumpShutdown and you know it.  The Democrats tried to fund the military during the shutdown and @SenateMajLdr squashed it.  I guess we know his agenda.  Stop playing political games with the Dreamers and CHiP and cancel the stupid wall.
954940253302870016 2018-01-20 04:54:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark "Zinke  . . . oversees an agency that employs more than 70,000 people and manages 500 million acres of land, including the 59 national parks" and is doing a pretty poor job of it. Yes, it's disappointing but better to close than have safety issues. Will Zinke's flag be flying?
954932657271517184 2018-01-20 04:24:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @funder Did you ever notice how each time this administration does something sleazy, they stand around afterwards, grinning like idiots? Someone should put together a picture book-very telling.
954932153485352961 2018-01-20 04:22:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @funder Going to be hard to overcome the Democratic shutdown since there isnt one. But the #TrumpShutdown they could easily fix. They made it, they can end it & they know how.
954927221571014661 2018-01-20 04:02:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @irishrygirl @ToeKnee405 I guess instead you will be running around in circles cheating release the memo. That should be good for a laugh.
954908215539654656 2018-01-20 02:47:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Listening to Eric Trump is worthy of a Fox News Alert?  Well, that just shows you that Fox is neither news nor alert.

It's gotten worse since this time last year.  You bet we're awake.  She didn't steal the nomination from Bernie; he's an independent that knew he couldn't run without Dem money.  Partisan politics-look at the Repubs. Textbook case.

954906660342059008 2018-01-20 02:41:03 UTC <sally_dehner> Yes, I did.  Pretty sure that recording was from Huckabee Sanders.  Had to be because it was all lies.

Those decades of misdeeds & corruption you speak of are nonexistent.  You have been fed a pack of lies & swallowed them whole. They date back to her days as 1st Lady in Arkansas. No researching by watching Fox!

954900060868960256 2018-01-20 02:14:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag @lcpinco If you really believe in "God bless the USA" you're the one that needs to expand your mind.  Do some real research (not Fox entertainment).  Try the BBC, Reuters or some other worldview news source.  You might be surprised to learn just how much of a minority your viewpoint is.
954895923175444480 2018-01-20 01:58:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag @lcpinco Ask yourself why dreamers were brought to America illegally as children? Could it be that immigration denied them a chance they needed?  Yet we didn't have a problem granting citizenship to a model.  If we use the merit system then I find Melania's acceptance questionable.
954895244251860992 2018-01-20 01:55:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag @lcpinco Well it is true that Republicans and Trump in particular lack imagination.  And as we've pointed out they lack empathy, compassion and all the other attributes that make American truly great.
954894724770525184 2018-01-20 01:53:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @ConnieBowes @J5_Project Connie couldn't take the heat so she blocked me.  That is such a sad loss to my twitter reading.
954886551955177473 2018-01-20 01:21:09 UTC <sally_dehner> The moment when you know the Republican agenda is anti-military, anti-family, anti-American.  They own this shutdown.  #TrumpShutdownhttps://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/954825373572726784
954885853842681856 2018-01-20 01:18:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis @NancyBarrera I call this one of those coffee-spitting memes. Love it!
954885700607971328 2018-01-20 01:17:46 UTC <sally_dehner> Woo Hoo! Blocked by another crying Trump supporter.  They try to defend the Republican agenda but when they can't, they bow out with a whimper.

954883891311071232 2018-01-20 01:10:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily 45* ruined a whole year in the life of America; he messed up his own anniversary celebration.

954881228204859392 2018-01-20 01:00:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump I guess if regulating for clean air, clean water, safe working places, freedom from discrimination, expecting your bank & financial advisor to be upfront & not cheat you, etc., etc. is unnecessary then wow! Thank you 45*, give us much more & we'll never recuperate from winning :(
954880098947272707 2018-01-20 00:55:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag @lcpinco They expected good people to choose between CHIP and the Dreamers.  The hypocrisy of these Republicans who swear they are pro-life, pro-family!  They tick me off.
954879717462724608 2018-01-20 00:54:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag @lcpinco We are being honest and your are missing the point.  When you speak slightingly of the Dreamers yet believe in upholding America's freedom you are proving why this is a #TrumpShutdown.
954879191526363137 2018-01-20 00:51:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag @lcpinco #TrumpShutdown is in place because among other things the Republicans wanted to hold the Dreamers hostage to a useless wall.  Who is worried about our military right now?   @clairecmc & other Dems put forth a bill to protect them during the shutdown, who objected? @SenateMajLdr
954878410400174080 2018-01-20 00:48:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @ConnieBowes Connie, Connie, Connie. For every view like yours there are 1000's who know the truth.  You are right though.  Liberals have logic, as well as caring, compassion, empathy, & strength on their side. Republicans have Trump, @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan.  See the problem?
954877653286379521 2018-01-20 00:45:47 UTC <sally_dehner> No dear, the Republicans put THEIR agenda before the military and their families.  Did you know that @clairecmc put forth a bill to make sure the military was taken care of during the shut down and @SenateMajLdr objected to it! Just demonstrating what a louse he is.
954850433935335425 2018-01-20 22:57:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @Passion_4Paper Problem with 45* is he's clueless, lacks empathy & is totally self-obsessed.  Therefore this tweet is hard to read.  He could literally be that unaware I guess, trolling us seems a little too shrewd for his level of competence. So I just stick in the hysterical laughter meme.pic.twitter.com/WSxUTyA7eg
954846412138844160 2018-01-20 22:41:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @PressSec @glamelegance @jsholt1 Explain to us all how this is the Dem's fault?  The Repub's wouldn't work out a bipartisan bill & couldn't even get all their own people on their side much less enough Dems. Fund CHIP, protect the Dreamers, & admit the wall is a really stupid, expensive idea. There, it's fixed.
954845058175467521 2018-01-20 22:36:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @ConnieBowes Sorry Connie, when November 2018 comes we WILL remember exactly what the Republicans did.  #TrumpShutdown is on their plate.  I know it, the world knows it and you know it too, you just won't admit it.  #BlueItIs2018
954842982020255744 2018-01-20 22:28:01 UTC <sally_dehner> Well Amber, I truly see the love YOU have for your fellow citizens.  Wonder why we hate 45*?  Might it be because of the fact he & his followers think your way? You think being a liberal is a mental disorder & I know that it means being of sound mind. #NotMYPresident #Resist.
954840828379369473 2018-01-20 22:19:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @maziehirono Wait for 45* to do what?  Stop golfing, come back from Mar-a-Lago, get a clue of how to do his job?
954840491736084481 2018-01-20 22:18:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @maziehirono @smontgomery48 Two points: trump shot down the bipartisan deal that supposedly was on the table and what's going on right now will bode blue at the polls this year. This is a #TrumpShutdown and everyone knows it except for a minority of misguided trump supporters.
954839017450766337 2018-01-20 22:12:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump No, that's not who I am, it's what I'm becoming under this disaster of a presidency.  I find myself wanting to use horrible language (wonder where I get that from), getting upset with strangers whose ideas appall me, etc., etc.
954831636629213187 2018-01-20 21:42:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump That hysterical laughter is verging pretty close to hate on my side.
954828252329185280 2018-01-20 21:29:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @ParksCanada Congratulations to all new Canadian citizens.

American citizen, just asking.
954827465238745088 2018-01-20 21:26:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump I am literally wearing out the hysterical laughter meme today.  From the clueless prez to the shutdown WH to wannabe maga's who make us laugh every day, this poor guy is getting really tired.pic.twitter.com/b8RkTioXZc
954825777471684608 2018-01-20 21:19:39 UTC <sally_dehner> For a laugh call 202-456-1111 for a recording (apparently written by Huckabee Sanders) that tells you that you can't leave a comment because the Democrats have shutdown the government. Apparently they totally missed the actual event. Is this the Repub equivalent of mansplaining?
954820465859710977 2018-01-20 20:58:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag Well, be honest, couldn't the Republicans have avoided that majority vote by listening to the American people & their own constituents & funding CHIP & taking care of the Dreamers? Republicans created the divide and refused to bridge it.  And don't get me started on clueless 45*.
954818608781234176 2018-01-20 20:51:10 UTC <sally_dehner> "I've seen better cabinets at IKEA" I love it!  I'm going to borrow that line.https://twitter.com/Toaddio/status/954766110615834626
954817912493301764 2018-01-20 20:48:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers And when @clairecmc tried a bill to make sure our armed forces would be paid during the shutdown, who objected & squashed it?  Why the obstructionist loser himself, @SenateMajLdr. Sarah, Sarah, resign & save yourself because when the endtime comes you are going to be in trouble.
954815816888963073 2018-01-20 20:40:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @EdKrassen @wordswechoose @Jcunliffe123 Excuse me, when did the president donate his salary to this issue? He gave the first quarter last year to a National Park but crickets since then.  I'm sorry Jojo but when you refer to 45* as an angel sent to help the people, you've lost all credibility.
954799024095277057 2018-01-20 19:33:21 UTC <sally_dehner> Well there you have it; proof positive that McConnell & the entire Republican administration have an agenda & it has nothing to do with protecting the military, nothing to do with protecting our youngest citizens, nothing to do with recognizing our dreamers.

954721652385906691 2018-01-20 14:25:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @mgcfsh No insult to you was intended. Since 2016 my language has gotten saltier by a long shot. And you are so right about Wagners skewed priorities.

954626487180808192 2018-01-20 08:07:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @RoyBlunt @worrymissouri You are right Mr. Blunt, there IS a lot to do to show that Republicans truly value every human life.  You could have all started by funding CHIP, taking care of the Dreamers & keeping essential government services running.  But Republicans didn't do that, did they? #TrumpShutdown
954623843573911552 2018-01-19 07:57:15 UTC <sally_dehner> I guess 45* will not be getting his salary during the #TrumpShutdown.  Wait, wasn't he giving that to charity?  I seem to remember he gave the first quarter to the National Parks.  Anyone heard anything since then?
954623113362313216 2018-01-19 07:54:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP Let me correct this for you Mr. Pence.  Rather than solve problems, Republicans, who control all three branches of our government, chose to block real progress forcing a shutdown of our government.  The consequences of this lack of bipartisanship is on their head. #TrumpShutdown.
954598312056905728 2018-01-19 06:15:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @March_for_Life @FoxNews @AHamiltonSpirit More responsible governing by the Republicans tonight.  #TrumpShutdown
954596648323289088 2018-01-19 06:09:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenSchumer Hey, 45* said it, so it must be true.  It's a big mark against the president!  But wait, didn't he also say we needed a shutdown?  I'm sure I read that somewhere.  Oh, and he said he'd get the wall or shut the government down. It's a #TrumpShutdown because that's what he wanted.
954594638056361984 2018-01-19 06:01:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @NBCNews @NBCPolitics @AMC089 @katherineislay @DouglasAlmon No, just no.  The Republicans & their whole administration own this one.  It's a  #TrumpShutdown.  If they really wanted to maga, they'd be working 24/7 on bipartisan legislation & would have already approved CHIP & be working on daca. Standing their ground? No spines for that.
954591592794345472 2018-01-19 05:49:05 UTC <sally_dehner> Ah Sarah, your latest parroting of lies from the WH.

954546607936163840 2018-01-19 02:50:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @ironrookie All your memes & comments makes me realize I'm on the right side of history; not the trumpet side, not the deplorable side, not the misguided, blind side.  BTW, Fox has the worst case of VD, wonder if there is a cure? Of course not even mentioning breitbart, and the rest of fake.
954544105803132928 2018-01-19 02:40:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @ironrookie Gotta love a page like this.  It's such a great wake up call, reminding me of what we are fighting against. I work to get Fox out of bars, restaurants & offices; we don't need all that fake news.  I pray every day that our country will survive this trumped up disaster
954526805087739904 2018-01-19 01:31:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis So I guess this is their solution to the illegal immigrant problem. "If they die in the desert we won't have to arrest them, send them back or deal with a request for asylum."  Well that certainly solves THAT problem.
954412390166286337 2018-01-19 17:57:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP Such hypocrisy and glurge; a deluge of high fructose corn syrup should fall on his head.
954385442195099648 2018-01-19 16:09:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @steph93065 @SteveKingIA @mhab1959 OMG, when will you people wake up and see that 45* winning the election was a Constitutional crisis? We are in peril and being led by the biggest con artist to ever play three card monte with our democracy. Sheesh.
954381387662086147 2018-01-19 15:53:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @PRyan @LindseyGrahamSC Always appreciate someone who shares a little humor for me to have with my morning coffee. Thanks!
954351992587079680 2018-01-19 13:57:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @EdKrassen @wordswechoose @Jcunliffe123 Jojo , you feel bad Haiti/other countries dont have our resources but think about this. Our country has plenty yet there are places in the US that rival the shitholes in poverty. Those places lack decent housing, good medical care, are sometimes food deserts. Shame on us!
954093806063939585 2018-01-18 20:51:04 UTC <sally_dehner> This is what journalists do-they point out the truth.https://twitter.com/soledadobrien/status/954084175635779586
954092838710628353 2018-01-18 20:47:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei Excuse me-the VP supports FADA (upholds discrimination against gays) which says (1) marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man & one woman, or (2) sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage.  I question why Pence has never called out 45* on #2?
954088911709581312 2018-01-18 20:31:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @GOP Some who went online may have been wanting to know which journalists and news services had done the best job in covering 45*.  Sort of a twisted version of my friends enemies are my enemies.  This is my enemies enemies are my friends??
954086231352201218 2018-01-18 20:20:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @johnrutledge @Think_Blue_Sky This could end up being the perfect picture of the 45* presidency.
954085049330208768 2018-01-18 20:16:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @bellaby99 @JohnDingell @ErnestoValdes17 Dream on Mr. Valdes; the stock market rise didn't begin with 45*.  During Obama's first 2000 days in office the market rose 142%.  President Obama took the market from 7949 to 18250.  As for companies investing; they are being rewarded with our tax dollars.
954081819745505281 2018-01-18 20:03:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @TomCottonAR @ALT_uscis @marie_11112 Perhaps Tom Cotton should attach this form to his cease and desist letter.  They both come from the same racist, misogynistic dirt pile.  That is the place where the current administration likes to play.
953831209389477888 2018-01-17 03:27:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @CNNnewsroom Why would the GOP be scrambling for votes to avert a shutdown?  Don't they have control?  This is on their head.
953830139619631105 2018-01-17 03:23:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @GershKuntzman @Kim_New_CA Whoa, you really are in fantasy land.  I had no idea the great awakening people were quite so off the wall.  Good-bye.
953829706331279364 2018-01-17 03:21:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @bellaby99 @JohnDingell @ErnestoValdes17 You are funny.  The saddest thing about the 45* physical was that it showed that his hatred, spite, & disastrous policies cannot be blamed on either a physical or mental illness.  It's all on him now & there's to be no trying to blame future disaster on his lack of mental health.
953783054060924928 2018-01-17 00:16:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @bellaby99 @JohnDingell @ErnestoValdes17 If you are suggesting trump is deranged I will second that. There was nothing in his recent health report to dispute it.
953708166877007877 2018-01-17 19:18:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @GershKuntzman @Kim_New_CA Hillary Clinton also had a clear-eyed, honest view of trump supporters. You should reread her comments. Which adjectives do you subscribe to? Racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist, Islamophobic? I keep her speech in my notes to remind myself who we need to protect ourselves from
953706704264486914 2018-01-17 19:12:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpPoll Whoops, accidentally hit C! No way, no how. This president flunked his first year big time. I think suspension is not appropriate, he needs to be expelled.
953703661066170369 2018-01-17 19:00:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @GershKuntzman As Ive told many of those who share your beliefs-awake, wide-eyed & very knowing here. I recognize lies, know a charlatan when I see one & try not to have disdain for those who define themselves as deplorables. Truly, I have sorrow & concern for your future & the future of USA.
953698676651778048 2018-01-17 18:40:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @GershKuntzman Sad to see anyone using words like great awakening and we the people in conjunction with maga. Do you realize that you have not hooked yourself to a blazing star but rather a white dwarf?
953697298437103616 2018-01-17 18:35:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @GershKuntzman @jasotbr And most people, for their drivers license, lower their weight. And like me, list their height when they were 16 and never change it. Gravity takes its toll on you and 45* is not immune, no matter his wonderful genes.
953694236775473153 2018-01-17 18:23:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @EdKrassen @wordswechoose @Jcunliffe123 You are right that Haiti does not have our resources and they have been served badly by the rich and their own government. Sort of like areas of our own country that would be annoyed and angry to be designated as such.
953693274765742080 2018-01-17 18:19:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @EdKrassen @lougarcia3 Perhaps 45* will do for Haiti what he did for Fire and Fury both the current book and the 2008 one by Randall Hansen!
953685208259354624 2018-01-17 17:47:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @bellaby99 @JohnDingell @ErnestoValdes17 I believe my doctor diagnosed me with #45*dailydisastersyndrome and #45*liarliarpantsonfire allergies.
953684105039884289 2018-01-17 17:43:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @JohnDingell @al2ic2ia How is having 45* as president uniting our country?
953680013311856640 2018-01-17 17:26:48 UTC <sally_dehner> Im thinking the person who retweeted this didnt bother to read the article. Whoops.
953679470770229248 2018-01-17 17:24:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis @AP House Intelligence Committee May have become an oxymoron.
953676336547225600 2018-01-17 17:12:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @mttowe I would take the time to explain history to you, give you the links to the real story, show you the amazing, wonderful work the Clinton Foundation has done in the world, but why bother? You would rather tweet lies and crap. A closed (and hate filled) mind will never accept truth.
953673438480171009 2018-01-17 17:00:40 UTC <sally_dehner> My fun read of the morning. Good luck to all my favorite journalists and news sites. If the awards really happen and arent just fake may the best and brightest win. Thanks for doing your job.
953672670872252416 2018-01-17 16:57:37 UTC <sally_dehner> We predict Donald Trump's Fake News Awardshttp://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/donald-trump-fake-news-awards
953479290464669701 2018-01-16 04:09:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @JohnStossel A money grabbing slander machine, otherwise known as the trump administration.

This administration is junk. If you really are a protector and defender of our nation you would be a member of the resistance, calling out the lies and hypocrisy.
953307205473841154 2018-01-16 16:45:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @thehill Where do these ridiculous politicians come from? Is there a training school somewhere that teaches ridiculous answers to pertinent questions?
953306023703531522 2018-01-16 16:40:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @VUMChealth @eugenegu @Ben___Leonard Im still confused about the initial complaint by a patients mother? Did Dr. Gu suddenly stop treating a patient to drop to his knee & take a selfie? Why would you be checking Twitter or Facebook, trolling your doctors name? Did she think opposing racism makes him a bad doctor?
953303306255912960 2018-01-16 16:29:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @DonaldJTrumpJr @TheDemCoalition @tdMcMains I get where youre coming from but Junior opened up the family to finger pointing by posting a picture of his daughter. I believe that demonstrates both bad parenting and a clueless public figure.
953297401393176576 2018-01-16 16:06:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @funder Apparently 45* said shithouse instead. Will you rerun this with the correct word in the future?
953285130440904704 2018-01-16 15:17:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk @lost_cj @JessicaMeltzer Im curious, Jessica-how do you feel about one person, one vote and abolishing the electoral college? Is this a discussion we should have in the future?

This whole discussion is about hypocrisy. Calling porn erotic art is being hypocritical. Pretending the trump group has any family values is hypocritical. 45* saying hes not a racist? Yep, we are going to wear out the letter H.
953071553826181120 2018-01-15 01:09:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @FoxNews @MLRosie @POLILLITAM @BryanHarman @mrballoonpimp And I have made clear my one issue and it would be hypocrisy. Oh, how it clings to this president, this administration, their base and their state run TV.
953070338111410177 2018-01-15 01:04:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP I dont know the provenance of it, but my immediate reaction to this statement is the saying white man speaks with forked tongue.
952990271737880577 2018-01-15 19:46:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Thank God, she has muted me.  It gets tiresome trying to make people see truth.  Time will fix that blindness, but it will be too late then.

952983783275417600 2018-01-15 19:20:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @FoxNews @MLRosie @POLILLITAM @BryanHarman @mrballoonpimp You miss the point about the marriage talk.  I have friends who have been married 2 or 3 times; they made a mistake & moved on.  But they didn't cheat on their spouse & no one held them up to the world as a fine example of family values.  Really, what got 45* elected is hypocrisy
952982513596723201 2018-01-15 19:15:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily @BavarianMoto Okay, you made me laugh!
952953749336707072 2018-01-15 17:20:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Your comment is telling-ObamaCare DID exist rather than DOES exist. And mentioning Medicaid in this context when we see the handwriting on the wall, ouch. Medicare as a voucher system is just a step away. I say again, why do Republicans hate ordinary citizens so much?
952952493859852289 2018-01-15 17:15:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Republicans used the tax scam as an end run around the ACA when they realized they couldnt kill it outright. To all intents & purposes the current ACA is slowly devolving into trumpcare. No mandate & allowing insurance companies to work unimpeded to make more profit=trumpcare.
952934048070078464 2018-01-15 16:02:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump I know Im not alone in saying, if you want to make America great and keep her first in the eyes of the world as well as the eyes of her own citizens, then you really need to step down. P.S. please take the VP and your entire cabinet with you.
952931367716884486 2018-01-15 15:51:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Before the ACA the biggest cause of bankruptcy filings was crushing medical expenses. Better healthcare coverage dropped that number by half!
952930699698495488 2018-01-15 15:49:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Hate to be bearer of more bad news but if trumpcare is the law of the land your brother-in-law has a pre-existing condition and will be kicked into the high risk market. If he thought he had medical expenses before, just wait.
952927331684880384 2018-01-15 15:35:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @cmclymer I will take my spirit lifting laughter wherever I can find it.
952922894752997376 2018-01-15 15:18:17 UTC <sally_dehner> Please tell me a debate between 45* saying shithole or shithouse is a story written by The Onion. Oh well, I guess you really cant make this stuff up.https://twitter.com/rvawonk/status/952772461870899200
952802601384513536 2018-01-14 07:20:17 UTC <sally_dehner> It's easier to understand why we got saddled with Trump (the stable genius) when you read the amazingly unstable comments and warped views that come cheep, cheep, cheeping out of Twitter.
952801950239744000 2018-01-14 07:17:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd The real entitlements, the handouts?  Take a look at corporate welfare and then come back and tell me they are the truly needy. You are right though, apparently those corporate entitlements and rich peoples neediness have killed their souls.
952801543086116864 2018-01-14 07:16:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd See that is the story you have been fed.  People receiving entitlements, they're able-bodied, should be working, they're not truly needy.  You haven't seen that, you've just heard it's so.  The number of people scamming the system is not the huge number you think.
952800982009819136 2018-01-14 07:13:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Husband in remission from leukemia.  All that hard work and savings and wonderful stock market returns?  With trumpcare there is the possibility it will all go for that pre-existing condition if cancer returns.  Why do Republicans hate us so?
952800604455342080 2018-01-14 07:12:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd My daughter had lousy insurance before the ACA.  Catastrophic coverage with a 25,000 deductible.  Now as a self-employed person she was able to buy on the marketplace & be covered with a decent policy.
952798044566810625 2018-01-14 07:02:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis People like this are voting? In our elections? I see why 45* got foisted on us.  I have always admired our educational system but something is seriously wrong if public education produced someone who could write this drivel.
952783639741390848 2018-01-14 06:04:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag I guess that is what confuses and appalls us.  None of us watch Fox so we don't know what the heck this so-called president is talking about half the time.  That said, I'm not watching Fox just to make sense of a school boys vicious tweets or a valley girls jealous streak.
952782807432081409 2018-01-14 06:01:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Case in point-InBev.  Anheuser-Busch was a great company but along comes a buyout opportunity and whoosh, those great jobs and security and pensions-it's all gone.  August Busch IV saying AB won't be sold on my watch and then turning right around and selling it anyway.
952782200243654656 2018-01-14 05:59:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Rereading your tweet reminds me that while my husband worked his butt off, not everyone is lucky enough to snag the good job, be healthy enough to work their butt off and have their company treat them right.  Case in point-InBev.
952781850430328837 2018-01-14 05:57:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Jonathan Gruber was an architect of the ACA & his history would seem to contradict his later statements. But in defense of the ACA & its regulations, when you are serving millions of people & trying to protect them from money grubbing insurance companies it takes regulations.
952778332055236608 2018-01-14 05:43:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Rereading your tweet reminded me of the fact that while my husband worked his butt off to have what we have, not everyone was lucky enough to snag the good job, be healthy enough to work their butt off, not have their company go bankrupt or outsource. Case in point-InBev.
952777518645424128 2018-01-14 05:40:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Sorry, regulations are not always make work for bureaucrats. Thats a Libertarian/alt right narrative with violin accompaniment. Regulations are usually the result of someone cheating (for instance the need for the clean water act). There are a few exceptions like Repubs vs ACA.
952776490990604288 2018-01-14 05:36:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Well our legislators seem completely incapable of enacting useful legislation so I guess thats why we are going down the tubes. I wonder why we needed so many regulations in regards to the ACA. Could it have been related to the Republican effort to scuttle it from day one? Yep.
952756001656238080 2018-01-14 04:15:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @ShallTakeCare @voxdotcom @DJTDioxide Well since climate changes and thanks to us it's changing for the worse, why would the administration have a problem with the term? Oh wait, to make changes to us might cost money & require regulating those pesky companies that have this administration in their back pocket.
952722410373091329 2018-01-14 02:01:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @ShallTakeCare @voxdotcom @DJTDioxide Well that clinches it. You are not a scientist but you would fit well into the clown administration.
952679166331236354 2018-01-14 23:09:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @jamieleecurtis @lazyzimms @AZ_bombero Regardless of where you live. One person-one vote.
952678799707172864 2018-01-14 23:08:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @jamieleecurtis @lazyzimms @AZ_bombero Perfect system? Oh, I dont think so. One person-one vote.
952678617829597185 2018-01-14 23:07:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @jamieleecurtis @lazyzimms @AZ_bombero Im trying to remember if we ever talked in civics class about the possibility that an election could be tampered with (hacking wasnt in our vocabulary). Im sure we must have but back then who would have thought? You know what I did hear in civics? John Kennedy has been shot.
952676435625500672 2018-01-14 22:58:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @jamieleecurtis @lazyzimms @AZ_bombero Civics class was where I first learned about the electoral college. Even at that young age & not able to vote yet, I thought the EC sounded like a scam. So  I vote but my vote doesnt really count? My vote is less important than some vote in Wyoming? Yep, thats how it works.
952666344788516864 2018-01-14 22:18:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @FoxNews @MLRosie @POLILLITAM @BryanHarman @mrballoonpimp I guess I am close minded when it comes to the family values people lauding 45*. Never have we had a president (and a First Lady) who so controverted the very idea of family values. Also I am curious as to the artwork on your walls.
952661511410978816 2018-01-14 21:59:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @jamieleecurtis You are right on Ms. Curtis. If this had happened before January 2017, people would not have seen it as the very real threat it is now. 45* has made the world a much less safe place because of his bombastic stupidity. The great negotiator? Not hardly.
952659962693668864 2018-01-14 21:53:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @jamieleecurtis @AZ_bombero @lazyzimms Correcting misinformation: he didnt win the election. Millions more voted for his opponent, (she was the better choice). He won because of a fluke in our election system called the electoral college. Its possible our election was tampered with by a foreign power. So no deal.
952628220993687552 2018-01-14 19:47:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @JohnDingell Seems like one of two scenarios here: either 45* knew about the false alarm & was so uncaring he didnt even stop golfing or no one told him because they were afraid of his reaction. Both scenarios are equally horrifying.
952621592240107520 2018-01-14 19:21:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag This article details exactly what is wrong with Congress-men serving 20-30 years, complaining that others make their party look evil & dysfunctional, eyes lighting up at the privileges that come with the job but not willing to do the bipartisan work to really serve constituents
952616788260540418 2018-01-14 19:01:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @FLOTUS @POTUS @FoxNews @cowboyneok If you are the third wife and you know he cheated on the others, why would you expect family values?
952616191943757825 2018-01-14 18:59:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @FoxNews @MLRosie @POLILLITAM @BryanHarman @mrballoonpimp Okay Mr. Pimp, you just gave me the biggest laugh for the day. This is not porn but erotic art. Every time I see our First Lady (or third lady to be exact) I cant unsee these pictures which I stumbled on some time ago. I guess art is in the eye of the beholder.
952613125580361729 2018-01-14 18:47:22 UTC <sally_dehner> Right on, Ryan! Because telling the truth and standing up for who we are and what we believe in requires us to oppose 45*.https://twitter.com/proudresister/status/952293756945879040
952398477518131200 2018-01-13 04:34:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @funder @vickilcastro Not that I;ve ever seen a porn movie, (cough, cough), but I think you are right.
952396618770337792 2018-01-13 04:27:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @crazyrednovels OMG!! Stephen Miller just proved himself the idiot everybody said he is.  And 45* golfs and pretends nothing happened, proving himself to be the most clueless prez ever.  You are right, this is insane.
952395122016124928 2018-01-13 04:21:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @ShallTakeCare @voxdotcom Apparently the philosophy is if you don't say climate change, it ceases to exist.  Isn't that just what you would expect from this clown administration? Climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change.
952394063873019904 2018-01-13 04:16:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @alt_interior @AltDptEducation @AltDIA @AltUSPressSec @AltHomelandSec @ALT_uscis @alt_labor @SallyBunnell1 Same here. Thanks to all the "alts," you frequently make my day.
952389072512782336 2018-01-13 03:57:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @eugenegu @DelthiaRicks So a woman whose child was benefitting from Dr. Gu's knowledge and expertise had the nerve to complain that he's against white supremacy?  What, she supports Nazi's and racism?  Vanderbilt Medical Center made a big error in their handling of this.
952385343608803328 2018-01-13 03:42:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @LisaMoraitis1 @RedTRaccoon @lagato88 Will they be singing "We've a story to tell to the nations"?  Sorry, that hymn just popped into my head.  Apologies to the late H. Ernest Nichol.
952307479882420224 2018-01-13 22:32:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd I give up. You have a skewed view and nothing will change it for the better. I will pray for you and our nation that we live through this fiasco.
952296575799357440 2018-01-13 21:49:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Sorry you didnt do better. Love your comment about housing bubble & blaming on Dems. Trickle down in place now so we can expect another catastrophe down the road. Your comments have amused me-gotta love that 45* smoke screen. But Republicans never learn.
952272881437855744 2018-01-13 20:15:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd College savings plans.  Interesting.  Only people with money to invest can set up college savings plans & even then it's hard to save and earn fast enough to keep up with the cost of higher education.  And get back to me after 2025 on those wonderful new tax reforms.
952272195945984000 2018-01-13 20:12:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Just want to point out that regulations almost always come into existence because somebody tried to cheat.  They are characterized as abusive by the people that were abusing the system.
952271762535874561 2018-01-13 20:10:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Yes you need to work for city, country, government, be a teacher to really ensure a pension.  Self-funded pensions is what it's all about now & what do you think will happen when the inevitable market downturn comes along?  So tired of the Repub harping on "abusive" regulations.
952271183164166147 2018-01-13 20:08:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Sam's Clubs were failing in comparison to Costco-could that be because Costco is a better company for it's employees?  Update: e-commerce distribution centers are rapidly becoming mechanized so those jobs may not be around much longer either.  Sorry to be a downer but I have eyes
952270389329178625 2018-01-13 20:05:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Good for you.  Sadly while you were carefully investing many others were not as fortunate.  I laugh to see that you assume I am complaining personally about the trickle down theory of economics.  My family did very well with our investments during Obama & apparently so did you.
952247265686585344 2018-01-13 18:33:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @crookita Did he say he didn't want to hear that vulgarity? Maybe he and his boss need to get off their ass*s ( sorry, more vulgarity) and protect us from 45*. Do you get tired of calling these politicians? I have my 3 on speed dial.
952245804961542144 2018-01-13 18:27:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd So true. This president is the hurricane destroying all that is good. The wildfire leaving death and destruction so the mudslide of corporate greed can take the rest. He better look over his shoulder! The snowflake avalanche and the blue tsunami are coming his way :)
952245013223759877 2018-01-13 18:24:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Excuse me Consuelo but the tax scam laws have barely kicked in. Did you get a better paying job? Who with? Carrier, AT&T or maybe Sam's Club? I hope not with the coal industry! You have a pension? That makes you one of 13%. You are not one of the little people if you have stock.
952235828327182337 2018-01-13 17:48:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @whoisgarylee Gary, you brought tears to my eyes. That picture of you with President Obama illustrated love in action. Good luck in all your life plans.
952233992295735297 2018-01-13 17:40:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @BooBooNyc No need to twist or discredit; we've heard so many lies,  he has prepped us to be skeptical.
952233264625922048 2018-01-13 17:37:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller @consueloyd Healthy as a horse, stable genius?? Is the trump brand in trouble over horse racing?
952232597928767489 2018-01-13 17:35:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @markknoller Taking awhile to polish the narrative. If he didn't tell him to change his diet, lose weight, and get more exercise then his sterling credentials will be under investigation.
951995275673038849 2018-01-12 01:52:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @MattGertz @runCliffrun Could have fooled me. When a woman is bright, intelligent and present to discuss the issues, apparently he could only handle that by sinking to sexist remarks. Perhaps he thinks hes Gods gift to women. Well hes misinformed.
951983107430854656 2018-01-12 01:03:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @Maryeb2Boyle @CREWcrew @alackaschmatz If I remember what I read when researching both Erics foundation and the trump foundation, the event in question was held at a trump property and charged full price for its use so basically the fund raising went to the trump coffers.
951934569657372673 2018-01-12 21:51:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @Delilia_OMalley @JoeBiden Your third point is the most important one.  This is not what a president should believe.
951892963621208065 2018-01-12 19:05:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @Chetlsmith @JamesPMorrison That is like saying Paul Ryan has been slightly ineffective as a Representative and seems to not have much respect for the people he governs.
951892291836313600 2018-01-12 19:03:02 UTC <sally_dehner> Blocked by @ginger6516. Thank God because she is apparently a New World Order conspiracy theorist and naturally a 45* supporter. Watch out for her if she tweets garbage.
951879035067551744 2018-01-12 18:10:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @teacherdude Wow, who knew Shakespeare had a crystal ball that had shown him 45*
951878474620383232 2018-01-12 18:08:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @pollpush @ginger6516 Yes, we need security so lets build a secure wall around the WH. Make sure wi-fi is not available. Cost will be covered by the elimination of constant golf trips :)
951845870991040515 2018-01-12 15:58:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @washingtonpost @TheLoyalO Its so difficult to decide which cabinet member is the worst but theres no question America is the biggest loser.
951844513882034177 2018-01-12 15:53:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @LisPower1 @carterda And US beaches will be destroyed if Zinke gets his way. Oh, except for Florida, who asked nicely to be excused from destruction.
951843611485921281 2018-01-12 15:49:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @JuddLegum He watches Fox and Friends because if he watched real news (Id recommend BBC) hed hear the truth and he cant handle the truth.
951842857253527552 2018-01-12 15:46:36 UTC <sally_dehner> We will never make this list until 45* is gone and Republicans change their platform.https://twitter.com/botswana/status/950223808526475264
951839708421804032 2018-01-12 15:34:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @FiveRights @JaxSpad3z Honey, keep it up! Everything you say proves my point. Mental health care must be a bigger priority.....oh wait, under trump no healthcare at all is the big priority.
951836410201427970 2018-01-12 15:20:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @FiveRights @JaxSpad3z One tiny flaw in Obamacare, but I admit it has had a profound effect on our nation. It apparently allowed a small percentage of people in need of mental health care to vote through the eye of their illness. That made them think 45* was a good candidate. Meds might have helped.
951826021829005317 2018-01-12 14:39:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @FiveRights @JaxSpad3z There is a flaw in Obamacare! People like Jax have not been getting the mental health care they need.
951821707383361541 2018-01-12 14:22:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @kaitlancollins Well if sh*hole resonates with his base that will be more evidence his base is deplorable. See, Hillary was right.
951818314556289028 2018-01-12 14:09:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @UnfollowTrump @SaysEdwina Trump thinks the WH is awful. If he could, he'd probably sell it for peanuts (or swap it for another golf course) and move the administration to Trump Tower.
951659898714116096 2018-01-11 03:39:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @nw_christina @davidfrum @claudiapoindex2 Trump wouldn't move to Norway, not if he has to show his tax returns.
951650591134179328 2018-01-11 03:02:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Glad they asked nicely because my first instinct would be to slap you and tell you to shape up and do your job properly. No offshore drilling you dummy, you're supposed to protect our nation, not sell it to the highest bidder.
951619056423133184 2018-01-11 00:57:17 UTC <sally_dehner> Well one sentence was not a lie. What a mess. 45* and the entire administration, what a mess.https://twitter.com/TeaPainUSA/status/951463864830439425
951185466304466945 2018-01-10 20:14:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Betting North Korea wont retaliate? Lets remember the president couldnt even make a success of a casino. We shouldnt allow him to bet on anything.
951183805624274944 2018-01-10 20:07:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @DougalsBeard @sullivanamy @eganmarshaart So that is how you see it? Wharton should sue every time he mentions going there because he comes across as mostly uneducated. His successful businesses? Bankruptcy, lawsuits, debt, cheating, plastering his name on buildings. His books? Ghostwriters, every one. What a ripoff.
950867891204907009 2018-01-09 23:12:26 UTC <sally_dehner> What is going on in that video?  Does he really not know the words to our National Anthem or is he ill?https://twitter.com/KaniJJackson/status/950542168774475776
950867068936650752 2018-01-09 23:09:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @kkhcloyd Let's make #gobackhometoBallwin a thing.
950866628140552192 2018-01-09 23:07:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @PLWhitaker Not only political posturing but Ann doesn't have a clue how to make America great either. She is interested only in fattening the pocketbooks of herself and her donors.  Very sad.  She really needs to #gobackhometoBallwin.

950732553903853570 2018-01-09 14:14:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @pauldemko @TaurusBone @4nnette_ Trump wants us divided but he didnt create the divide any more than Obama did. He just shined a light on it & said both sides have really fine people. He  therefore gave racism, misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia, etc., a wink & an equal place at the table.
950578992939175937 2018-01-08 04:04:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @pauldemko Because, seriously, if people dont even grasp why were upset, theres no pointtheres no conversation to be had there.  That statement pretty much sums up the way I feel right now.
950577259672408064 2018-01-08 03:57:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @CREWcrew @spaine1958 You win!
950577110107803648 2018-01-08 03:56:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @CREWcrew Because trump loves me so much I got the email about my chance to win.  Don Jr and Eric are going to be there too!! You only have to give a dollar to enter for a chance to win.  Too bad I won't have a chance because I wouldn't give that man a single nickel.
950573702663540737 2018-01-08 03:43:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenWarren @countermoonbat Sorry for late reply.  Let me correct this for you.  Trump and the GOP are only interested in what is profitable, not in what is moral.  Their opinion and their vote are both for sale.
950573229151850496 2018-01-08 03:41:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @benshapiro @countermoonbat @erhk023 And sadly you and others never see that these two stances are not mutually exclusive.  Sigh.
950570164646567936 2018-01-08 03:29:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @atDavidHoffman I guess some people never read her speeches and especially her debate rebuttals.  Inspirational, aspirational, clear-sighted and spot on about what a trump win would mean in the way of a disaster for our country.  Oprah was spell-binding but you should have listened to Hillary.
950437801048313856 2018-01-08 18:43:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @libshipwreck I believe it was Donald Trump who said he wanted only rich people in his cabinet because poor people wouldnt be qualified. Laugh, snort, giggle, snort.

950228370578640896 2018-01-07 04:51:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @KevinDarryl You couldn't pay me enough to watch it.  But I will read the transcript afterwards.  Those always reveal how poorly he is able to construct sentences, complete thoughts and deliver great ideas.  Plus they're good for a laugh.
950226067004035072 2018-01-07 04:42:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @RaisedRightWI Thanks for admitting that there are evil corporations.  I disagree with you on receiving a living wage. Paying workers a fair wage seems to take away from the bottom line, God forbid.  There are always dire predictions every time minimum wage is raised but they never come true.
950219691192127488 2018-01-07 04:16:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @Chetlsmith Don't like to criticize but if her job is getting Sanders camera-ready, she really ought to be fired.
950218979540389890 2018-01-07 04:13:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @RaisedRightWI Some corporations ARE evil; some billionaire CEO's made those billions on the backs of their workers.  If every corporation paid living wages to their workers poverty could be alleviated.  Why are there commercials during the Golden Globes? Because networks won't run it for free.
950218391931023360 2018-01-07 04:11:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @Papaterribile Actually I think they just raised the bar.

As Trump disasters accumulate, the mere thought of Hillary walking through the WH, speaking in complete, intelligible sentences, & making decisions for America based on love & respect for the people makes me sigh.
950140118672789505 2018-01-07 23:00:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Whoa! Cast of a bad sitcom. Wonder who is the second banana.
950129198856855554 2018-01-07 22:17:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Of course she's not worried about his questionable mental state; she doesn't have to put up with him like we do.
950127773506514944 2018-01-07 22:11:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @RealPressSecBot @chellenelson17 @JoyceHermit Some of these wonderful journalists, commentators and pundits are going to be really disappointed if they don't win. To receive the fake president's award is to be held up as the best at doing your job. I can't decide who to root for.
950126196339208192 2018-01-07 22:05:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @kabrinkman @CTO1ChipNagel Love this but Putin should be in the suit and Trump in the apron. In other words, the little woman presenting her well done turkey (eagle) to her loving? family after all her hard work.
950117858872320000 2018-01-07 21:32:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @davidaxelrod How can you tell Bannon is either off his rocker or the 2nd biggest liar? Read the statement about Don Jr being a patriot and a good man. I know, it's hard to do without rolling your eyes.

950087962888495104 2018-01-07 19:33:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @DearAuntCrabby Is this the woman that said Trump had, among other things, criticized her for gaining weight? I remember thinking that working with Trump either paid extremely well or she was a masochist.

949712237773643776 2018-01-06 18:40:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattyglesias The line-up.  "Tell me, ma'm, which one of these people stole your money?"

949376821530976256 2018-01-05 20:27:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly GOP should try winning an election fairly instead of always cheating. But I guess they can't win any other way.
949375965771259910 2018-01-05 20:24:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily A GOP Congressperson breaking a promise?  Business as usual.

949373752768434176 2018-01-05 20:15:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @johnrutledge I keep hoping that just once, one journalist will stand up and say "I'm not playing this game anymore" and walk out.
944055069309374465 2017-12-21 04:00:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @asihtos I have to agree. Playing foil to trolls, deplorables and the deluded is a thankless task. I just get suckered in sometimes, thinking if I could just open their eyes to reality. But..sigh....its never gonna happen. Happy Holidays and may you weather 2018 with fortitude and grace.
944053741686312961 2017-12-21 03:55:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @asihtos So you are in the 20% paying ALL the taxes? That really bothers you doesnt it? You make the money, you pay the taxes. Ordinary people pay a lot in taxes, in fact the middle class moves the economy. As a wealthy man pointed out-Im only one person, I can only buy so many things.
944052464835231745 2017-12-21 03:50:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @asihtos Not mad, just sad. Sorry you have such a warped view of the world. Believe the comments of corporations saying that NOW theyll raise salaries need to be investigated. If the stock market is so great & companies had so much money overseas, what took them so long?
944051537797615616 2017-12-21 03:46:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @asihtos Dream on baby.
944051408789176320 2017-12-21 03:46:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @asihtos I doubt you are one of the 1%. Someone making 25,000 per year & getting a $2500 tax break, great! Someone making a million has already benefitted from all sorts of tax breaks (which this tax scam seems to have preserved & increased). At a certain point how much money do you need?
944049274458968065 2017-12-21 03:37:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @asihtos People in glass houses should not throw the word delusional around-crack, crack, crash!
944048535527481345 2017-12-21 03:34:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @asihtos I believe that in the past you could deduct your losses from theft. I would like to deduct the salaries of Ann Wagner and Roy Blunt because they are guilty of theft from the people of my state-the very definition of losers.
944047660671078405 2017-12-21 03:31:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @asihtos BTW, saving your money has nothing to do with the tax scam. People that need tax relief are living paycheck to paycheck working 2 & 3 jobs. I would be thrilled if they were getting a tax break of decent proportions that would allow them to pay their bills & save some money.
944046087689703424 2017-12-21 03:25:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @asihtos I was simply pointing out that for many, many people that giant tax cut amounts to peanuts. The shit eating grins on the faces of those Republicans says it all-gotcha! Theyve made out like the bandits they are.
944042089591070720 2017-12-21 03:09:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @LibertyHussein @funder You are so funny!
944041044898959360 2017-12-21 03:04:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @asihtos "What are you going to do with that huge tax cut the Republicans gave you?" " I'm going to McDonald's for lunch and then pick up a few things at Dollar Tree. "
943964299453763584 2017-12-21 22:00:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepDianeBlack @POTUS @WhiteHouse @DavidBegnaud @romaa13 Did she just admit that there was no real election? So he was basically foisted on us.
943530352475295745 2017-12-20 17:15:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Strategic greed managed by politicians beholden to even greedier donors. Nothing to admire today.
943523229414625280 2017-12-20 16:47:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Large tax cuts true but meaningful for whom? Will we hear fantastic stories of companies raising pay across the board & each state raising the minimum wage? Will every family tweet about their wonderful health insurance coverage? Plus no need to raise prices on products!!
943344153546711040 2017-12-19 04:55:47 UTC <sally_dehner> This has been my point over and over. Health insurance and healthcare should never be at the mercy of your employer and their chosen insurance company.https://twitter.com/ricksmithshow/status/942955293146800128
943343708065423362 2017-12-19 04:54:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @johnrutledge Since when is being criticized for voting for a tax scam a sexist act? I thought being greedy and near-sighted was pretty much gender neutral.
943343152513081344 2017-12-19 04:51:48 UTC <sally_dehner> Thank you sir, for fighting on behalf of your constituents and all Americans.https://twitter.com/senwhitehouse/status/943225251034468352
943342527809245189 2017-12-19 04:49:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily So if you were wondering if Moore would have been a good choice as a senator, I think hes answered your question.
943341690387140610 2017-12-19 04:46:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @kylegriffin1 So Scott Pruitt is paranoid about what? That people might learn about his agenda and break into his office to save the environment?
943245371207290880 2017-12-19 22:23:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alt_FedEmployee Besides having most of the people in this picture go to jail, it would be satisfying if their thumbs were also removed.
943243969684795394 2017-12-19 22:17:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @maziehirono Thank you for your honesty Senator Hirono as well as your hard work on behalf of ALL citizens.
942894068849405954 2017-12-18 23:07:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly @politico Why should he resign when Congress is chock full of members who apparently have done the same or worse?  And of course the presidential office is occupied by the chief pussy grabber and to top it off the entire Congress is currently demonstrating their greed and selfishness.
942782227632607232 2017-12-18 15:42:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Dream on, dream on. If you told me the sun was shining Id open my umbrella on the spot.
942548577460551680 2017-12-17 00:14:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltNatParkSer Still not seeing MO on this list. Oh wait we have Hawley backed by Greitens *sigh*
942548278851325952 2017-12-17 00:13:16 UTC <sally_dehner> FBI doing their job. Mueller doing his job. I admire people who are competent at their jobs. Therefore I am angry with trump, who is incompetent and tells lies.https://twitter.com/susannow3/status/942542712766595073
942547345962651649 2017-12-17 00:09:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Integrity and Roy Moore in the same sentence; very amusing.
942243650205093888 2017-12-16 04:02:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Trey Gowdy wasted so much taxpayer money; his time in Congress is a complete waste. If anyone needs to be ousted Id start with the Republicans sitting around in Congress.
942063234764419073 2017-12-16 16:05:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alyssa_Milano @lambosoa @KensAudioBoston I see no problem between A & B. Recognize that sexual misconduct is morally unacceptable then take step 2 & let the punishment fit the crime. Since these are crimes of power, let the first level be loss of power & then move up the scale with jail time for rapists & pedophiles.
941917578594783232 2017-12-15 06:27:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @tedcruz @PoliticalShort @chrispshelton Well I'm pretty sure given his comments, Cruz has no idea what ending it means (Verizon, Comcast and ATT said try it you'll like it) & of course tRump would really be clueless. Just look back in recent history to see why net neutrality is an issue that needed protecting.
941853039404740610 2017-12-15 02:10:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @ooshdesign So many reasons tRump should be removed from office-should we count them?
941802148886732800 2017-12-15 22:48:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @KMOX @ComeCleanNicole @DebbieMonterrey @dtwyman Why do all the scam organizations have such innocuous, misleading names like Missouri Alliance for Freedom, Citizens United, Show-Me Institute, Cancer Fund of America, Americans for Prosperity? I guess it makes it easier to fall for them, sort of like MAGA.
941798660723048448 2017-12-15 22:34:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @the_mathlady And Roy Moore also said women shouldn't run for office so are you glad you don't have to see him in the halls of Congress?
941723744195637248 2017-12-15 17:36:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily And vice versa.
941690156540669954 2017-12-15 15:23:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @MerriamWebster Oh dear, Ive been wrong for so long. Ive always used shrunk when it should have been shrank.
941689512920604672 2017-12-15 15:20:50 UTC <sally_dehner> ALL Americans need you to vote no on this tax scam.https://twitter.com/tessacurly/status/941650245754216448
941684055719989249 2017-12-15 14:59:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @CNN Exactly. It illuminates the old saying follow the money.
941682380385013760 2017-12-15 14:52:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @AGJoshHawley I do not see Missouri on the list of states suing to protect #netneutrality. Is it possible that you are on the side of big business? I thought in one of your tweets you claimed to be protecting citizens, especially the disadvantaged.
941679620256092160 2017-12-15 14:41:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @BetoSenate2018 @BetoORourke @PoliticalShort @Native2ATX @LandreyHarris Us left leaning, bleeding heart liberals recognize delusion when we see it. And we see the results of it in the eyes of food pantry visitors.
941678332697071616 2017-12-15 14:36:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @perlmutations As a feminist I say Sarah had the right to apply for the job of press secretary and be hired if she was the best qualified no matter her gender. But then she demonstrated she wasnt qualified. Feminists do not support poor job performance.
941677168920268801 2017-12-15 14:31:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing I truly believe Cambridge Analytica is a key piece in this scenario, as both an instigator and a complicit tool. And then there is their involvement in Brexit as well. If it wasnt such a tragedy this whole tale would be like reading a great mystery novel.
941675640025178113 2017-12-15 14:25:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @BetoSenate2018 @BetoORourke @PoliticalShort @Native2ATX @LandreyHarris I agree. You voted for Cruz?? Go figure. I wonder, in their spare time, do Cruz and Roy Blunt sit around and count their money from big donors and laugh about how deluded their supporters are?
941674731635343360 2017-12-15 14:22:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @BetoSenate2018 @BetoORourke @PoliticalShort @Native2ATX In the past I never donated to political campaigns-thank you tRump for changing that. But I cant help but think its sad that Goldman Sachs & Lockheed Martin can drop thousands into the Cruz coffers & the rest of us struggle to send small contributions to people who support us.
941672947579748353 2017-12-15 14:15:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @jenjifero @PoliticalShort @7lifeisart Sorry about your typo; if only twitter had an edit button. Its okay though, we know you meant to say Republicans not liberals. You are right-the lying from the right is unbelievable.
941672064271962112 2017-12-15 14:11:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @tedcruz @PoliticalShort @chrispshelton Actually Cruz revealed himself as misguided, clueless, rude and probably in the pockets of big businesses. I think some house(and senate) cleaning is overdue.
941669665054609408 2017-12-15 14:01:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @clairecmc Excellent example of the quality and competence required to be a part of this administration. *sigh* When will this end?
941331720707690496 2017-12-14 15:39:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @crazyrednovels //www.c-span.org/video/?c4668388/ann-wagner-yells-freedom.    I know where youre coming from.
941330835403403265 2017-12-14 15:35:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei OK, he just pretty much slammed and made fun of internet users and did it by way of a conservative news site. Can he make his intentions any plainer?
941329260333150208 2017-12-14 15:29:19 UTC <sally_dehner> I cant even come up with a comment on this. Absolutely mind blowing to see a graph of what is happening right before our eyes.https://twitter.com/dleonhardt/status/941285840248037377
941318302256844800 2017-12-14 14:45:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @krassenstein @bamahJay I saw it on the Independent UK site. Pence said they werent going anyway, keeper of the keys of the Holy Sepulchre said they asked to come and he said no. I imagine there will be many places in the ME where Pence will be unwelcome.
941166324688064517 2017-12-13 04:41:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @krassenstein Two reasons why Trump does not remember meeting any of these women: 1-He probably never looked at their faces and 2-He's harassed so many women he can't possibly remember them all.
941045401402167296 2017-12-13 20:41:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis @ellyay Is that Pence immediately to his left? There is some sort of white orb sticking out of his head.
941010267130998785 2017-12-13 18:21:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis A staged photo op missing its mark. Gotta love it, but did feel bad for the horse.
940970146675478529 2017-12-13 15:42:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @DavidCornDC @LylajoyRose Lyla, I guess you missed the conclusions from the Benghazi hearings.
940968957577744387 2017-12-13 15:37:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @Max_Benwell @SafetyPinDaily @jprice720 Love your reply but just want to point out that competence in a job is paramount, no matter what your job is. That being said, since Trump is not a very competent president, do we really think hed be a successful custodian?
940706100860674048 2017-12-12 22:13:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @430rhonda @Varulven16 @willbarrett_1 @JanBarrow2016 So basically even if Roy Moore never touched a single teenager he would still be a lousy choice for the Senate by virtue of cheating & a lack of respect for the law. An interesting history for the supposedly moral, law abiding man from Alabama. I want Doug Jones in the Senate.
940674165593526272 2017-12-12 20:06:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @430rhonda @Varulven16 @willbarrett_1 @JanBarrow2016 Thanks Jan! Theres a lot to unpack in that article. No revealing of the Moore tax returns (borrowing from his enablers [Trump] playbook) and this constant talk of morals and morality by a man whose own morals seem flexible.
940564520988172288 2017-12-12 12:50:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @JulieSLalonde @leighkjekstad @SurpriseSparrow @sjcalgary I think you are overestimating. The population of men who are onboard with doing all the jobs of Christmas is an incredibly small number from what Ive seen. They should be appreciated for their rareness and be a protected species :)
940562175437017088 2017-12-12 12:41:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @Greg_Palast @AmyCoopMayB You cant make these things up. Merrill must have learned a thing or two on his visit. Have to love his comment about the two extremes of living in Russia-huge wealth contrasted with grinding poverty.  Excuse me, does he wear blinders while hes home in Alabama/United States?
940560152025096192 2017-12-12 12:33:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk Its almost like Alabama knows something fishy is going to happen with this vote and wants to hide it and delete it. Makes you wonder.
940559049476714500 2017-12-12 12:28:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @430rhonda @Varulven16 @willbarrett_1 @JanBarrow2016 Jan, I knew Moore got kicked off the bench (and banned from the mall) but I missed the charity scam issue. Do you have more details?
940556680382869504 2017-12-12 12:19:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Things like this make me wonder about this mans thought processes. He literally bragged about assaulting women with a description of how he does it but then expects us to believe the women are lying. The Mueller comment is just wishful thinking.
940420628917649408 2017-12-11 03:18:44 UTC <sally_dehner> From twitter defender to graphic philosopher. Love it!https://twitter.com/pdolby/status/940371647449763840
940276689728360450 2017-12-11 17:46:46 UTC <sally_dehner> This article is worth a careful read. If Moore, who is a frankly disgusting example of Republican stances, wins this election, it will be in part because of a voter suppression policy.  This is the only way for Republicans to win; they wont make it otherwise.https://twitter.com/wildonnelly/status/940227070063513601
940273635536842752 2017-12-11 17:34:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Perhaps the president should try watching CNN, MSNBC & throw in some PBS, BBC plus try checking out Reuters if he wants to do some reading. Reliance on Fox, Breitbart & Infowars is misshaping his view of the world. Presidents should not listen to fake praise & no real news.
939717170031939584 2017-12-09 04:43:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @davidfrum @Scone_Mason I misread your tweet; thought it said he was worried about the size of his thong. Not an image I want in my head :)
938963906801881089 2017-12-07 02:50:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @chelseahandler @BoycottBertha Most of the other comments here are rude but yours is downright stupid. Trump can't set the world on fire with truth because he doesn't know what that is. He literally can't speak it. The California fires are God's revenge? What pretend religion do you practice?
938780459290546177 2017-12-07 14:41:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @Pajjr2016 @politicususa This is exactly why Mr. Franken should not resign. Or he should make his resignation dependent on Moore stepping down from the Senate race and, more importantly, on Trump resigning from the presidency. The playing field needs to be level.  Dems need to back this.
938160683832758277 2017-12-05 21:38:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @costareports @RonMwangaguhung Good point, because good character and strong morals are apparently not valued in Alabama.
938079980843601920 2017-12-05 16:17:50 UTC <sally_dehner> You forgot to mention she's a female too. In Trump's world that's three strikes you're out (unless she's a 10 and he has tic-tacs in which case she's acceptable to look at.)https://twitter.com/charlesjaco1/status/938077032004583424
938078210239156224 2017-12-05 16:10:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis Ollie North should have been tried for treason over the Iran-Contra scandal, so it's no surprise he would be involved in this latest treasonous proposal. Maybe he'll get his just desserts this time around.
938076375063367680 2017-12-05 16:03:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @maddow @VaughnHillyard @4selat Along with that-if you have a cute teen-age daughter and you were in a room with Trump what would you do if he took a container of tic-tacs out of his pocket?
938074664756285441 2017-12-05 15:56:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @VaughnHillyard Passing the tax scam in the Senate has energized the Republicans. They think "if we could fool people into believing the tax scam was in their best interests, let's tell them pedophile Moore is a bonafide christian that we need in Congress, they'll believe it."
937693218359140352 2017-12-04 14:40:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @GOP @BlueRootsRadio @Belairviv Change of logo was necessary because elephants voted to sanction Republicans for using the elephant as a symbol while encouraging shooting of said elephants. Cant have it both ways guys; either you get to keep the logo or you can kill elephants. Rat vote of objection coming.
937689222978383872 2017-12-04 14:25:06 UTC <sally_dehner> Elissa Taub wins this morning for this reaction to Chuck Grassley suggesting ordinary citizens spend all their money on booze, women and movies. Also comment seen on FB-Netflix & beer fridge are keeping me from being a millionaire https://twitter.com/ejtaub/status/937442620745375746
937093645479677952 2017-12-02 22:58:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @lisamurkowski If that is what you think your vote accomplished youve either been grossly mislead or willfully complicit in a scam. Either way the American public just lost big time.
936804514698477568 2017-12-01 03:49:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alt_FedEmployee I try to keep my language cleaner but youve just tweeted exactly what I was thinking.
936803527854235649 2017-12-01 03:45:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis @taxmarch They know if they dont pass it now, its never gonna happen.
936802945756143616 2017-12-01 03:43:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @clairecmc Great phrase; very descriptive. By the way, I called your office this am-your staff always sound cheerful & happy, Senator Blunts office, not so much. They were probably tired of hearing pleas to vote no. Or maybe they were thinking how this tax bill will hit them personally.
936802080294977537 2017-12-01 03:39:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @clairecmc @confusedabout I think you have Claire confused with Trump. Plus I dont even think she spends much time golfing. That whole plane thing? Thats the Trump administration again and I guess the tax break on private jets is to comfort them when they can no longer requisition our planes.
936801083569029120 2017-12-01 03:35:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @clairecmc @oldrndrt Go back and research the number of hearings, the speeches Obama made on behalf of the ACA. There was no hidden agenda. The Republicans worked hard to ruin it but they definitely knew what was in it. Tonight is a travesty.
936787683061334016 2017-12-01 02:42:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @NormOrnstein @Singerman2000 Not only do lots of people like Democrats (after all a Democrat won the presidential election) but they will be even more beloved when the tax scam reforms start kicking in & people see just what Republicans think of the average Joe Citizen. If Karma has a big sister, watch out!
936781927561830400 2017-12-01 02:19:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @cspan @JSEIFERT10 Would that be the non-discussion that Trump proposed? Frankly I thought that was a good decision; why waste time with someone who already had his mind made up?
936781013895692288 2017-12-01 02:16:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @NormOrnstein @Singerman2000 I have a nice life but there is no doubt it would be better without the Republicans of Congress who despite being elected & promising to serve their constituents, have actually rolled over for the tummy rubs given by big donors & lobbyists. What a bunch of turncoats.
936773296107880449 2017-12-01 01:45:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @jonfavs @DavMicRot Sounds like the tax reform scam in a nutshell-tax breaks for the special people and a load of nothing for ordinary citizens.
936770177022140416 2017-12-01 01:33:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @keithboykin @TrueBlueLiberal You make a good point. I believe the women who have come forward are just the tip of the iceberg.
936765536289067008 2017-12-01 01:14:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @sueweaver16 No I am not a teacher but I know Margie Vandeven was supported by many teachers, school administrators and school board members. Plus, I am not a Greitens fan so my first instinct is to find his actions suspect. He took money from DeVos so this may be payback time.
936737033573355520 2017-12-01 23:21:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Its obvious they know they have to get this done right now before anymore revelations about Trump, Russia, a possible bogus election or even treason end up shutting everything down until these accusations are sorted out. This is their only chance & they are feeling the pressure.
936731895739682816 2017-12-01 23:01:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @krassenstein Well thank heavens we can count on Roy Blunt to do the right thing for America. Or maybe not.
936731016496107525 2017-12-01 22:57:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @MarcCox971 @Singerman2000 @jallman971 @sueweaver16 @EricGreitens @88YahamaKeys Well, Greitens fixed the vote so, not an employee of DESE but a Missouri citizen that recognizes cheating when it happens, whether in school or in the government.
936729491988197378 2017-12-01 22:51:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Weve been trying to fire our employee, Donald Trump, by shaming him but the problem is he has no shame.
936728840021467141 2017-12-01 22:48:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis Senator Collins, do you believe in unicorns and the tooth fairy?
936728135164399616 2017-12-01 22:46:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @MarcCox971 @Singerman2000 @jallman971 @sueweaver16 @EricGreitens @88YahamaKeys Only a certain kind of person thinks Greitens is doing a good job. I think most people understand hes not here for Missouri citizens; this governors gig is just a stepping stone in his big career plans.
936722979974778880 2017-12-01 22:25:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily I have emailed you my request that you vote NO on this horrible tax scam bill. And frankly winning your vote by offering to allow drilling in the Arctic is a double horror.
936721870551945222 2017-12-01 22:21:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @MarcCox971 @Singerman2000 @jallman971 @sueweaver16 @EricGreitens @88YahamaKeys I consider Greitens to be a mini-Trump. He had a strong, capable person in the job but she doesnt toe his (or DeVos) line so out she goes, even though it took him two tries. So MO children will suffer by losing quality.
936700875229270016 2017-12-01 20:57:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @maziehirono Thank you Senator for your hard work and willingness to support, not just your constituents, but all Americans!

936675352033812480 2017-12-01 19:16:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @libshipwreck There are so many disasters tucked away in various lines of this tax scam bill.

936262616250552320 2017-11-30 15:56:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @jonfavs To be called stupid by the President is actually an honor. If he liked me and called me smart Id start rethinking my political philosophy.
936249557545115650 2017-11-30 15:04:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @libshipwreck Lisa Murkowski is absolutely giddy over this part; her name is on it. At this point I wouldn't give you 2 cents for a single Republican Senator.

People have said he is paying us to protest too and if hes giving me a paycheck I need to talk with him about how slow it has been to arrive. But Im not just joking-I really would like to meet him.

935976155148103680 2017-11-29 20:57:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly Well his base doesnt understand economics plus they believe every lie hes ever told.  Sad.

You would actually vote for Roy Moore? Even if you ignore his accusers the rest of his history makes him a poor choice for the Senate.
935878120078442497 2017-11-29 14:28:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @parkse @DC_Resister_Bee Trey Gowdy and Devin Nunes, what a pair. Will this investigation cost as much as the useless Benghazi one? (I think Trey should pay for this one out of his own pocket.) Will Trey or Devin cheat? We will wait with bated breath for the non-results to come out in a year or two.
935872468400721920 2017-11-29 14:05:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @BlueRootsRadio Rick Wilson spoke exactly what I believe and I don't think the two of us are alone or even in a minority. Sanders is the press liar for the president liar. What a wonderful addition to her resume.
935868240198238211 2017-11-29 13:49:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers When will the current president be fired for sexual assault and for putting out fake news? We are getting two for the price of one here.
935849125844746240 2017-11-29 12:33:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag Every morning someone shares a joke of the day and today was your turn. Oh wait, you were being serious??
935732528169832449 2017-11-28 04:49:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly So I guess the CFPB is history. Soon there will be no citizen protections at all. Elizabeth Warren has always had constituents best interests at heart. Unfortunately the Trump administration has no heart at all.
935730453767737344 2017-11-28 04:41:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP Such delusion by Pence; obviously not competent to step up when Trump is impeached. I guess the vice-president will need to go too.
935628428967063557 2017-11-28 21:56:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @aj_lefevre Yes I read the thread & except for the last paragraph recognizing rape culture (which I agree with obviously) the article came off as an explanation (excuse) for 1940s attitudes towards womens sexuality. Didnt your comment suggest we not take a shot at this Christmas song?
935532772512411649 2017-11-28 15:36:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @GOP @ForeignPolicy @AliciaRagusa2 I have to say that I dont think the sand is where the GOP has their heads right now.
935530968349315072 2017-11-28 15:28:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @aj_lefevre But whether you judge this song by 1940s standards or current ones, its still kind of a yuck song. Its why men still think they can say I know she said no, but I didnt think she really meant it.  I wasnt aware there was a battle but this is my take on the skirmish.
935529094476976129 2017-11-28 15:21:32 UTC <sally_dehner> If its running on Fox, people like me wont see it, but then we already know and are appalled at the tax reform scam.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/935354095795408896
935527950186926081 2017-11-28 15:16:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers I wish two random citizens named Chuck & Nancy would show up. Chuck could ask to see Trumps past tax returns & Nancy could suggest he resign & save us all a lot of time and trouble. That would be a more useful meeting. The other Chuck & Nancy shouldnt be wasting their time.
935495554544603136 2017-11-28 13:08:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @Newsweek @SafetyPinDaily Just think of this-its your wedding & you ask one of your special guests to offer a toast. Imagine President Obamas words & then imagine Trumps toast. Trump is like the annoying, maudlin relative that you keep away from the microphone so he doesnt embarrass you.
935370147233173504 2017-11-27 04:49:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @WhiteHouse @BobinHB @FLOTUS I have a question. Have the Trumps spent so much on golf trips that there is no money left to heat the White House? I ask because the First Lady always seems to have a coat thrown over her shoulders as though she is cold.
935291775886995465 2017-11-27 23:38:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly I guess I will use the next Uline catalogue in my fire pit on the patio.
935291267566710784 2017-11-27 23:36:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP If this administration was committed to true tax reform and tax relief for working families the bill on the table would look very different from this tax scam.
935158472446038016 2017-11-27 14:48:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @RadioFreeTom @videosurg I would hope the majority of college professors voted for HRC. It would be depressing to think educated people thought voting for a reality tv star who plays golf, bankrupts businesses, assaults women, lies and tweets garbage was actually a good choice for president.
935156676684075008 2017-11-27 14:41:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @RadioFreeTom @narddoggie Wonder what percentage of billionaires DON'T have college degrees? Of course a degree does not guarantee intelligence or compassion; after all even Trump touts his Wharton diploma.
935141897777172482 2017-11-27 13:42:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @yashar I think his resigning should have been conditional -he resigns if others accused step down from their positions as well i.e. Moore drops out of Senate race and Trump resigns as President.
934984170408947712 2017-11-26 03:16:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alt_FedEmployee The last thing Alabama needs is Roy Moore and frankly the last thing America needs is Donald Trump. Pedophiles like Moore and sexual abusers like Trump should never be given positions of authority.
934926069764943872 2017-11-26 23:25:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @johnfkirby63 A fake claim about a fake news source by a fake president.
934886694775611392 2017-11-26 20:48:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @EdKrassen @baileymarkham And my point was numbers show that there weren't 60 percent of people in Arkansas supporting trump. It was actually less than 25%. And maybe someday those 600,000 people will wake up and see what a mistake they made.
934802977814142978 2017-11-26 15:16:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @EdKrassen Im confused by the math here. If Arkansas has a population of 2,978,204 & 65% voted in the presidential election but the vote totals of Hillary & Donald plus other candidates together add up to just over 1,130,685 ?? Arent 800,000+ votes missing? English major here, help!
934797220502757376 2017-11-26 14:53:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @EdKrassen Less than 65% of Arkansas population voted in 2016. Vote totals-684,872for Trump and 380,494 for Clinton. I guess those 300,000+ people remembered her differently or possibly the 684,000+ are fond of 2nd rate reality TV stars.
934795279160823808 2017-11-26 14:45:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @EdKrassen Interesting you mention that Arkansas vote because the Hillary is bad narrative started there & grew. She was an outsider when Bill was governor and she tried to improve the state; apparently Arkansas hated that.
934258843420372999 2017-11-24 03:14:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @rob_bieber @allinwithchris @Monctonsnowman @MattTheHooper You believe Trump was the lesser of two evils (insert hysterical laughter here) and you think I'M the troll?? See, this is what worries us resisters; the inmates are trying to run the asylum.
934247793715269632 2017-11-24 02:30:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @rob_bieber @allinwithchris @Monctonsnowman @MattTheHooper Oh please, you are comparing an educated, intelligent, compassionate, hard working, patriotic woman to a morally bankrupt, pretend millionaire, 2nd rate TV star and tweeter who admits he forced himself on women and you have the nerve to call her repulsive??
934227068128292864 2017-11-24 01:07:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @travelinlady99 @JuddLegum I am a walk the walk person, not a talk the talk person. Of these two presidents who just talks about God and who actually works as a disciple? You can mention God 20 times in a speech but it's how you live that counts.
934128811616210944 2017-11-24 18:37:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily Sad to say, if you skip the line about the death toll as reported by Egypt TV & just read about gunmen surrounding a mosque, it sounds like a mass shooting in the US.
933927250118041600 2017-11-23 05:16:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @thedailybeast @SafetyPinDaily To win as the most deplorable Trump cabinet member-would that be considered a high bar or a low bar or maybe a swamp race?
933926306730868738 2017-11-23 05:12:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @politicalkiss Sounds good. I am all for putting you in a room with Roy Moore and you can backhand him. Wait, how old are you? Shoot, you are not young enough to interest him. No chance to defend against Trump either unless you are a 10.
933925287175258114 2017-11-23 05:08:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @politicalkiss I am thankful for my family and my fellow resisters. We recognize that the election of Trump was a big mistake, which we will work to correct. The corrupt Trump regime will not last.
933924530279665664 2017-11-23 05:05:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @CollinRugg @politicalkiss No stupidity on this end. Deep down in your heart you know Im right because if you are as intelligent and observant as you say then you see Trump is in over his head, incompetent as president but really just there to improve brand value for Trump name.
933920270150184960 2017-11-23 04:48:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @CollinRugg @politicalkiss Honey, I was referring to her work in education in Arkansas as First Lady. Even in the earliest part of her political career it was all about helping others.
933837634278961154 2017-11-23 23:20:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @SantosPrecimar1 Marlene, have you been sleeping for the last 10 months? Wake up girl and smell the coffee!
933837118639665152 2017-11-23 23:18:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump "Your" country is doing well? Who wrote this, a Russian? Last I heard the president was American and therefore a part of "our" country.
933826648511741957 2017-11-23 22:36:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @CollinRugg @politicalkiss Trump is just fine??? This is why you amaze us and disturb us. Are some American citizens that confused and uneducated? Any comparison of Trump and Hillary in accomplishments, personal beliefs and education leaves Trump in the dust. 10 months of golf, goofs & glurge. Yuck.
933558180679946240 2017-11-22 04:49:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @CollinRugg @politicalkiss You are so misguided. You have my sympathy now and in the future when we have to work to reclaim our country from the horror of this crime family/administration dba president Trump.
933557638226501632 2017-11-22 04:47:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @CollinRugg @politicalkiss The whole "Clinton's are corruption" link can easily be traced back & proven wrong. It started in Arkansas when Hillary was not accepted as first lady; considered an outsider. The help she gave to strengthen education, help with the children's hospital, ignored & belittled.
933453677796478978 2017-11-22 21:54:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @CollinRugg @politicalkiss Didnt make excuses to begin with. Truth, facts, evidence stare people in the face & they refuse to admit what is happening. Someday you will look back on this day & realize that we were at the top of a downhill slide of corruption & destruction that could have been stopped.
933080374183448577 2017-11-21 21:11:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @CollinRugg @politicalkiss Sorry, but I think you lack vision in this debate. Soros? Really? I hear that all the time but all of us protesting are still waiting for those checks people on the right said we were getting from this man.
933079406490406912 2017-11-21 21:07:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @CollinRugg @politicalkiss Did any of us deliberately choose to be dependent on oil? I believe big oil works to make sure their competition fails. When you hear solar doesnt work and wind farms are dangerous for birds Im pretty sure that finger pointing is big oil. And Middle East wars? Big oil.

And if people didnt have to show up to protest there would be no trash. How about being proactive to save the environment.

932675803296477186 2017-11-20 18:23:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @chrisgiddens @politicalkiss My daughter had very poor insurance, mostly catastrophic. Her insurance is more expensive but not prohibitively so, plus it covers way more than her former policy. Also appreciate ACA requirements for coverage of mammograms, well woman & not worried about pre-existing condition.
932398888035733505 2017-11-19 00:03:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @chrisgiddens @politicalkiss Strange because for every person like you that says ACA is not afgordable I know 100s & 1000s for whom ACA allowed them to have any insurance for the first time. My daughter is self-employed. Its not cheap, no insurance is but it is a Godsend.
932362901549142016 2017-11-19 21:40:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @chrisgiddens @politicalkiss Problem with less than a year of Trump-I dislike everything he has done or tried to do. Hated the Republican platform but Trump is 10X worse. Freaking out right now about tax scam & ACA. Journalists report, if Trump doesn't like what they say he needs to change.
932361164205510656 2017-11-19 21:33:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @chrisgiddens @politicalkiss Obama tried to work with Republicans from day one; they admitted their intention to block everything he wanted to do. Funny how Trump tries to discredit everything Obama accomplised. Now he's planning to kill the economic revival & job growth that took 8 years to get on track.
932353092615573506 2017-11-19 21:01:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @chrisgiddens @politicalkiss Suggest you do a retrospective of the Obama presidency; class in evidence everyday & no matter what got dumped on him he never lost his cool. Now we have Trump-a sad state of affairs. Uncool, uncouth, unintelligent, rude & a stranger to truth; chief distributor of BS.
932350887934251010 2017-11-19 20:52:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @Realjmannarino @KimberlyBlunk What a silly fairytale meme. None of you ever win an argument with anyone except yourself. When you are racist, misogynistic, a Nazi, an Islamophobe, or homophobe etc., facts, reality and history are against you before you even open your mouth. We don't need to argue with you.
932336349180518400 2017-11-19 19:54:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @TwitterMoments @DonMelissa1991 Exactly! The Trumps are setting a horrible example for young people. And the UCLA players are no better.
932335762493923328 2017-11-19 19:52:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @RedNationRising Definitely Trump has demonstrated that a businessman as president is a really bad idea. Although it could be that he is just a really bad businessman. Apparently America will be his next bankruptcy declaration.
931620569296105472 2017-11-17 20:30:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @Cthulhu_Beckons @ckn4502 Cindy, apparently we have been conversing with someone who is blind and clueless. I think our conversation with him is finished; makes no sense to waste time tossing facts into a vacuum. Thanks for your comments & take care.
931590386421784576 2017-11-17 18:30:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @ckn4502 @Cthulhu_Beckons Yes, and your sentence stimulated a discussion about how the harassment of women is somehow twisted to be their fault & men are really the victims. Thanks for verifying our suspicions.
931589510512734208 2017-11-17 18:27:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @Cthulhu_Beckons @ckn4502 Exactly Cindy. Youve hit the nail on the head. Men are targets when they are threatened by other men more than women (i.e. prison). I was a victim once because I was young, trusting. Even in that situation I used my strength to get away. (guy stalked me on phone afterwards yuk).
931587964186001408 2017-11-17 18:20:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @ckn4502 @Cthulhu_Beckons If the shoe fits wear it. That you would think all I want is revenge against men is humorous. I want women (and girls) to be heard & believed, not belittled, stalked or laughed at. Interesting that I did not use Roy Moores name in my recent comments but you know who is guilty.
931587094266425344 2017-11-17 18:17:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @ckn4502 @Cthulhu_Beckons If you have a complaint against a woman or women, in this newly open era, please feel free to make an official complaint complete with specifics, name, place,  etc. Your worry about how men will be perceived? Just think what women face & get over your fear.
931556550761730048 2017-11-17 16:16:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @ckn4502 @Cthulhu_Beckons And I bet the actual number of men that have been sexually assaulted by women is statistically tiny compared to men against women. And a 14 year old girl sexually assaulting a 30 year old male? Really? Men are vulnerable in some instances but not the same as women.
931555325513289729 2017-11-17 16:11:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @ckn4502 @Cthulhu_Beckons Oh come on Nick. To quote Nancy Reagan from another context, just say no. You are making this so stupid. I had no idea men were such puffballs. Read my lips: its not about you, you are not in danger, there is not a huge conspiracy of women out to get YOU.
931534693757005826 2017-11-17 14:49:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @ckn4502 @Cthulhu_Beckons Sorry you have demonstrated mine. You (& others like you) belittle what happens to women, try to make it about you. This is why women dont come forward. Shes ruining a good mans reputation. Funny, how hard it is for women to come forward only to have THEIR reputation ruined.
931326094510362624 2017-11-16 01:00:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @deaconseps @ShaunKing Well it may be historic but so was the confederacy and Hitler. Historic does not automatically translate to admirable or desirable, especially in this instance.
931267123158175744 2017-11-16 21:05:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @ckn4502 @Cthulhu_Beckons Certain things give a woman power over a harasser.  Age, strength, authority, economic security.  Which did you lack that made you a victim?
931266583388934149 2017-11-16 21:03:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @ckn4502 @Cthulhu_Beckons I was only harassed once in my life.  Yes, I was young.  Try it now & you would be sorry.  I'm also not worried about a job.
931266099479445507 2017-11-16 21:01:54 UTC <sally_dehner> I don't think you are 14 years old or under some woman's authority.  Your comment is slighting to women who face something you do not.https://twitter.com/Cthulhu_Beckons/status/931255074923401217

931200138453938176 2017-11-16 16:39:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers Disappointed in Al Franken.  I wonder if every man in the public eye who ever did things like this are wondering "when will what I did be revealed?"
931167921367322624 2017-11-16 14:31:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @VanityFair @SafetyPinDaily I thought that was a job requirement under Trump.

One more wall proponent, fake tax reform, kill the ACA useless Republican. Utah could have done a lot better.  Wonder how he'll fare in 2018? Perhaps you'll leave together.
930275985102077952 2017-11-13 03:27:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump If you were only coming home for the big middle class tax cuts I guess you will be staying in the Phillipines.  Too bad.
930131396739379201 2017-11-13 17:53:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @TjaderHelen Excuse me?  An elementary principal doesn't have a problem with "this" happening? I guess he thinks past history can be swept under the rug because it has no relevance in judging a persons worth, reliability and integrity.  The students at his elementary school have my sympathy.
929943118249676801 2017-11-12 05:24:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing She just wasn't thinking when she said that public officials who mistreat women should Step Aside'  Whoops! I guess she forgot the unwelcome kissing and the p*ssy grabbing.

928987509220048898 2017-11-10 14:07:36 UTC <sally_dehner> This seems to be a GOP philosophy that extends to the presidency as well. Is it actually written in the Republican platform or just implied? "If she weren't my daughter, wink, wink."https://twitter.com/jerzeygirl99/status/928960398686150657
928750446466031617 2017-11-09 22:25:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly Every time I think Republicans have finally gone as low as they can go, they get out shovels and dig a little deeper.

927999093548429314 2017-11-07 20:39:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @ADIC33 I read this headline & think "no way he said that" so I have to watch the blasted video & sure enough he did say something that dumb.
927776334520242176 2017-11-06 05:54:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @Shareblue @RVAwonk So in addition to all the other reasons not to vote for him, he's stupid too.
927764802323218432 2017-11-06 05:09:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Ms. Obvious here. If Trump isnt impeached there will be rioting in the streets. And there are more of us than there are of them.

926509269486325761 2017-11-03 17:59:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @CNN @ginothesaint May I point out that Bernie Sanders is not a Dem, but an Independent.  He was running as a Dem for the money, his own party did not rob him.

926505388555554816 2017-11-03 17:44:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @COGICFamily @TalbertSwan This is what the scene should have looked like if we had a president/SOS that really cared.pic.twitter.com/ZTIMtg9Slz
926325098516230146 2017-11-02 05:48:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP Suggest you look up hymn called "This is My Song" with words by Lloyd Stone.  Try remembering that God is the God of all nations.
926180804677521408 2017-11-02 20:14:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @federalreserve @POTUS @SenateMajLdr Sad but I automatically assume if you are for him, he probably isnt a good choice for the job.
925738482714267648 2017-11-01 14:57:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @Pajjr2016 @Lonewolfsanctu1 I can think of a few things Id like to do with that bat & Zinke but Im a Christian woman & I need to be better than that. But still....
925734736856846336 2017-11-01 14:42:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @RealJamesWoods Stumbled on James & Neal by accident. Real James Wood & Talkmaster? Clueless & Empty Barrel would be better descriptions.
925733912223145984 2017-11-01 14:38:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @Talkmaster Never Donald Trump-dont want those hands anywhere near me, you dont know where theyve been.
925732774044192769 2017-11-01 14:34:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alt_FedEmployee Its hard when youve been scammed to own up to it. Its embarrassing to admit you were blind & self-centered.
925730796949921792 2017-11-01 14:26:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump Did America do extreme vetting on your candidacy for president? So then YOUR 62.9 million voters like racism & incompetence? Rest of us? NO!
925729680086454272 2017-11-01 14:22:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump Did you use extreme vetting for your campaign staff? If so, was it intentional then that they all be Russian collaborators?
925564168526319616 2017-10-31 03:24:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Slow down gentlemen (& ladies) your unseemly haste is making it look like you know something we dont.
925561973852471296 2017-10-31 03:15:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @BBackerman1 Thank you.
925561160358944769 2017-10-31 03:12:31 UTC <sally_dehner> Thought that earlier but now Im sure that that person drowned a while ago. No hope for this WH. Off with their heads, (figuratively).https://twitter.com/herasmusb/status/925508891722551297
925536514519552002 2017-10-31 01:34:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump OMG, I thought this was satire & then I realized It was a presidential tweet! It sounded more Borowitz or Onion.

925470319279779845 2017-10-31 21:11:33 UTC <sally_dehner> The whole text book thing-glorifying the South through shaded history was quite successful.  A whitewashed romance-The Lost Cause. Sad.https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/925347652996337665
925352097935175680 2017-10-31 13:21:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @mattmfm @ReggieTap7 Start with Russia, then work our way through the rest of the investigation topics.
925350417684365312 2017-10-31 13:15:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @Acosta @RuningWildly Ivanka is a volunteer but it will be hard for him to play the hardly knew her card.
925345268832366592 2017-10-31 12:54:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @mrjamesob @Brendan_Surrey She probably has more balls than anyone else in the WH. It takes strength to stand before so many people & lie so creatively.
925340566581399553 2017-10-31 12:35:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump This tweet is hilarious. If you didnt know him, call him Mr. & its spelled Papadopoulus. Spelling seems hard for you (& grammar & truth.)
925209383474253824 2017-10-30 03:54:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump @nizbel You took the words right out of my mouth

925026843031465984 2017-10-30 15:49:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alt_FedEmployee No Trump tweets age well. He really should put down the phone today.
925026180218130432 2017-10-30 15:46:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @CnjranchS Along with other issues we need to work on the election system. Citizens United has to go. We need to make it fair for multiple parties.
925025832468467712 2017-10-30 15:45:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @CnjranchS As for Bernie-he has great ideas & he has been consistent all his life. But hes an Independent & trying to co-opt the DNC was wrong.
925025353445330944 2017-10-30 15:43:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @CnjranchS Not a coward; 8 yrs of competence & grace followed by 10 MONTHS of Trump swamp. Help, were drowning.

925014480018464768 2017-10-30 15:00:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @byrdinator And please forgive me for making fun when I know how truly serious this all is.
925014077172322304 2017-10-30 14:58:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @byrdinator Nah, Trump never even knew those guys plus Fox admitted Hillary Clinton is actually president. *alert for the satire impaired*

925003892345188352 2017-10-30 14:18:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP Just want to point out current tax code hasnt harmed WH job creation. Tons of lawyers hired in the last 10 months.
925002818146258945 2017-10-30 14:13:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @PalmerReport @JenniferTrump_ Wait, I get it. Fox slipped and admitted Hillary was president; thats why you are confused and think Manafort worked for her.
925002338921779202 2017-10-30 14:11:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @PalmerReport @JenniferTrump_ Nope but I will take to the streets if Trump tries to fire Mueller & you know he will. Must be scary time in the WH.
925001924138684416 2017-10-30 14:10:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @PalmerReport @JenniferTrump_ I guess your hallucinations showed you Manafort working as Clintons campaign chairman and Gates assisting . Snort, giggle, guffaw.
925001400576245764 2017-10-30 14:08:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @PalmerReport @JenniferTrump_ Poor Jennifer. Its okay, Trump fever sometimes produces hallucinations.

924972797394374656 2017-10-30 12:14:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @Pajjr2016 What is this woman supposed to be? I would guess the MAGA angel of death. Scary and possibly illegal.
924848524184956928 2017-10-29 04:00:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @PalmerReport @JenniferTrump_ Betting on Manafort, maybe Flynn, but lot of us would rather see Jared or Junior. Love there are so many 2 pick from. Trump posse going down
924840350035922945 2017-10-29 03:28:16 UTC <sally_dehner> Love it, love it, love it. If only I could get every trumpet to watch it & admit the truth.https://twitter.com/TheRickyDavila/status/924710988565417985

924809507036950528 2017-10-29 01:25:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @mike_Zollo Everyone chooses their protest-I'm protesting your characterization of football players as POS's by saying they are more admirable than you.
924808201765294080 2017-10-29 01:20:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @mike_Zollo Sir, read some history, re-read the Constitution & quit pretending that people taking a knee are disrespecting the flag, vets, the anthem.

924465729424035840 2017-10-28 02:39:40 UTC <sally_dehner> One thing about Trump, you can always count on one of his old tweets being appropriate for the occasion. https://twitter.com/RK_Hayes/status/924453301663309824

924315097887109122 2017-10-28 16:41:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @steve_vladeck Thought Trump referred to the military as "my generals". Sort of like my family: when the kids are good they're mine. When they're bad-his.

924007554572783616 2017-10-27 20:19:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP I doubt our enemies are questioning our military capability, just the intelligence & stability of the commander-in-chief.

923952852279668736 2017-10-27 16:41:40 UTC <sally_dehner> Good article. Sad we have to keep pointing out truth to Trumpers. The fact they voted for him suggests truth isn't that important to them.https://twitter.com/robertmiller18/status/923947977860878336

923939268132835329 2017-10-27 15:47:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @TwitterMoments Haven't heard expression "inmates running the prison", sounds like "foxes guarding the henhouse" both descriptions of current WH occupants.
923916081252782081 2017-10-27 14:15:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump What an illusionist you are. And frankly the cost of investigating you is worth every penny.
923735352501776384 2017-10-26 02:17:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @perlmutations @Pajjr2016 @MattMarkman Ugly! And I'm not just talking about the shirt and hat.
923732406577790976 2017-10-26 02:05:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP Point 1- lie, point 2- lie, point 3- by cheating. Please don't do us any favors. How 'bout that Congress & their sneaky night time stabbing?

923591736697507840 2017-10-26 16:46:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @NWPinPDX So sorry for your loss. Losing both your grandmother & your mom so close together must be heartbreaking.  Prayers & kind thoughts to you.
923590370621091840 2017-10-26 16:41:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @ProudResister The press has given him too much of a pass. Their reporting is just the tip of the iceberg. Trump is worse than their characterization.

923572649774735361 2017-10-26 15:30:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @pink_lady56 2/ now you have to watch *45 destroy everything with his perverted idea of a budget & tax reform. Unless you are a white rich male? Screwed.

923566933122932737 2017-10-26 15:08:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Hearing you support Ed Gillespie is enough to make me run to donate to his opponent. People of Virginia, beware of this *45 approved guy.

923324885140672513 2017-10-25 23:06:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @pink_lady56 You will need to take a plane when the Trump train crashes. Wonder which country Trump will exile to? If hes not in jail that is.
923324476976238592 2017-10-25 23:04:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @pink_lady56 Might want to watch news (other than Fox, which of course isnt news but entertainment) to see just who is crashing. Clue: hes not blue.

922442687147659265 2017-10-23 12:40:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump Let me correct it for you: People continue to kneel for the anthem as is their 1st Amendment right. Whining about it=no leadership in WH!
922277728086380544 2017-10-22 01:45:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Yes ma'm, women coming forward & admitting sexual harassment & assault, talking about a deep, embarrassing event in their lives=gravy train.

922276513176805376 2017-10-22 01:40:30 UTC <sally_dehner> An interesting set of links. When Trump goes, so must Pence; the sooner the better.https://twitter.com/ahamiltonspirit/status/921899863310262272

922272615254888448 2017-10-22 01:25:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @Team_Trump45 So hilarious.  Trump lies everyday then blames the media for lying.  There has never been a sadder excuse for a president.  Embarrassing.

922270313504702469 2017-10-22 01:15:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump Sinking through?  Are you talking about the swamp? No need to fabricate stories-they quote your words.  Lies & lies.  Fake? yes you are.
922269287909285889 2017-10-22 01:11:47 UTC <sally_dehner> Sally doesn't like this explanation which sounds dreadfully like the GOP version of tax reform.pic.twitter.com/STbrC3E7M1

922186472576503808 2017-10-22 19:42:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @RuthDavidsonMSP @Buggsma @rossyboi34 Just needed to point out he is neither a good businessman nor a good president. He demonstrates that every day.
922186010741694464 2017-10-22 19:40:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @RuthDavidsonMSP @Buggsma @rossyboi34 ???  Really, we don't know Trump's true worth (where are those pesky, audited tax returns)? Only have his word (lies a lot).
922181632479637504 2017-10-22 19:23:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @saintpeterclan I give up! You people lie & misdirect daily. She honored those people (unlike *45 who thinks golf is an honor), & she didn't lie. Wake up!

921452932238860289 2017-10-20 19:07:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @johnrutledge @timothywjohnson The NRA is sinking fast. Most likely the consuming fires will engulf Trump & his base as all those pants on fire meld into one inferno.
921451544599519232 2017-10-20 19:02:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @cherokeesher2 @BostonTennisFan That's the problem with #45. He's not only in over his head but his actions show a lack of love for the people & principles of America.
921444649109204992 2017-10-20 18:34:58 UTC <sally_dehner> Congrats Sager-Brown! I have served in mission there three times. I will be with you in spirit tomorrow & my prayers are always with you.https://twitter.com/UMC_UMCOR/status/921439669769957377
921096555628654592 2017-10-19 19:31:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @club4growth @KrisPBacon4 Grateful the current administration & their cronies (like Blunt & Wagner) are demonstrating their true colors. Watch your speed exiting.
921095317969350657 2017-10-19 19:26:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @club4growth @KrisPBacon4 Horribly true. 9 months of disastrous anti-American policy (mercifully stymied) & daily lies & embarrassment. Trump says "hold my beer."
920760097223204864 2017-10-18 21:14:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @IrritatingSmirk Ah, Mr. Trigger Warning, conversation is done.  Your tweets reveal your world is warped. Roll in the muck freely. Come out when you grow up.
920742871971565573 2017-10-18 20:06:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @IrritatingSmirk Actually I don't know you personally but I have made an assumption based on your comments & who you support. So it's a fair assessment.
920742409817985026 2017-10-18 20:04:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @IrritatingSmirk You are just making my day :). You claim lack of interest in my opinion. Methinks you protest too much. It's hard to defend lies and muck.
920730908637978624 2017-10-18 19:18:49 UTC <sally_dehner> Should we have a Senator that is this uneducated? Save us Alabama!https://twitter.com/ryanbeckwith/status/920678648042094592

920705895620907014 2017-10-18 17:39:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @IrritatingSmirk Thanks for pointing out my identity which, unlike some, needs no apology.  For a change, try social justice, make the world a better place.
920704761418190848 2017-10-18 17:34:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @IrritatingSmirk Oh and is there a reason you didn't deny my observation about that identity as racist, morally repugnant liars?  If the shoe fits......
920704166581932038 2017-10-18 17:32:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @IrritatingSmirk Don't blame me for your being confused.  The Trump base, small as it is, has demonstrated their lack of comprehension over & over. Sad.
920696832497463296 2017-10-18 17:03:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @JoyceCarolOates Hard to point fingers at this woman. She was always there, unlike the golfer.pic.twitter.com/ih5pxO5v9f

920686110501691392 2017-10-18 16:20:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @millerfred No confusion there. Vote for Trump get squashed. And voila, it's happening. Told you so, told you so. Prayers for our nation under Trump.
920685467707822080 2017-10-18 16:18:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @DineshDSouza @millerfred @IrritatingSmirk We understand the concept of transference because we see it everyday in Trump.
920684834103668737 2017-10-18 16:15:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @WalshFreedom @CADebMs I would just add "morally repugnant" to your description otherwise it's perfect. Thank you Deb.

920631748614066177 2017-10-18 12:44:48 UTC <sally_dehner> Trump is disgusting-morally, politically and personally. It's like we've stepped into a swamp & we're sinking.https://twitter.com/therickydavila/status/920076161027321856
920494114122207232 2017-10-17 03:37:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @erinscafe Yes, we get that now.  How naive of us to think that for one moment Trump could act empathetic & presidential.
920490449533534209 2017-10-17 03:23:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @ABC Excuse me, where is the president in this scene?  Should he not have been standing there saluting this soldier?

920115312573509632 2017-10-16 02:32:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing For Trump it's always someone else's fault.  Wait until ending the ACA subsidies backfires on him - wonder who's fault that will be.
920066077140443138 2017-10-16 23:17:01 UTC <sally_dehner> Coleen, can you picture Trump, shaking hands? Shaking, shaking, grabbing back & forth. Who would want to be consoled by the scary handshake?https://twitter.com/coleenperry16/status/920036446941204481
920034255631273986 2017-10-16 21:10:34 UTC <sally_dehner> Sometimes I think about retweeting whatever lies Trump tells each day but I don't think I have enough time to keep up with him.https://twitter.com/davidjoachim/status/919988605627584512
920031198906343426 2017-10-16 20:58:25 UTC <sally_dehner> This is an interesting theory!  I've often wondered why Trump chose Pence. Of course Pence sold his soul assuming Trump WOULD be impeached.https://twitter.com/misseslisa/status/920024255475089408

919724809809952768 2017-10-15 00:40:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP When the VP is that blind and misled perhaps he needs to leave when Trump goes.
919647490135265280 2017-10-15 19:33:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowTrump So this is a partial list of the bad things you've done so far. Where is the list of positive accomplishments? Waiting, waiting.
918675733534396417 2017-10-12 03:12:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Perhaps presidents should be licensed:  take classes, demonstrate proficency, take a written exam.  That might have eliminated Trump.
918670243412791297 2017-10-12 02:50:28 UTC <sally_dehner> Her comment about spending her twenties getting old men's tongues out of her mouth because they thought she was up for it is spot on.

918574945789267968 2017-10-12 20:31:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @SenWarren @SeanRoraback1 BTW are you related to Courtland Sykes? Another useless drain on female society.

918151699415687169 2017-10-11 16:29:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @UnfollowVP Current tax code is not as big of a disaster as what your administration has planned. Don't you dare say it helps the middle class. Big lie!
918150027515658240 2017-10-11 16:23:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @Pajjr2016 @joncoopertweets Warning to all Missourians. Josh Hawley has been consulting with the misfit Bannon. That tells you a lot about Hawley. Beware.

915362798540029952 2017-10-03 23:47:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s Frankly someone who characterizes themselves as all in 4 trump doesn't have the right to call themselves pro-life or a believer in truth.
915362363133583362 2017-10-03 23:46:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s Thank you for admitting it. Whoops, were you being snarky?
915361909477605376 2017-10-03 23:44:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s You aren't paying for their abortions! And they don't get to choose when because of Republican hypocrisy! You just don't get it do you?
915360667783385095 2017-10-03 23:39:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s Counselling is required, 72 hour wait period, no insurance coverage. Abortion may be legal but MO has made it impossible.
915360228731965441 2017-10-03 23:37:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s No, just making it impossible to get one. In 2014 only 2 providers in the whole state. 99% of counties have none.
915358290569285632 2017-10-03 23:29:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @chrisjenko I think the framers of the constitution might do a rewrite if they knew the right to bear arms would include automatic assault rifles.
915357159910727680 2017-10-03 23:25:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s Do you not see how hypocritical you are when you idolize the fetus and shame and endanger the woman carrying it?
915356797430566912 2017-10-03 23:24:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s The hypocrisy of acting as though a late abortion is a woman's choice. Back off & make sure birth control & education are a bigger priority.
915356406718631936 2017-10-03 23:22:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s Given it a lot of thought & Republicans are full of it. Abortions are legal & that makes you mad. So you make it hard to get & dangerous.
915355116106125312 2017-10-03 23:17:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s Repubs should be held responsible when women are forced into late term abortions. My comment holds; against abortion, don't have one.
915354419193053184 2017-10-03 23:14:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s You want abortions outlawed; not everyone shares your opinion. But we believe late abortions are bad & dangerous. People like you make it so
915353929386520576 2017-10-03 23:12:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s Frankly I have no problem if you are against abortions. Don't have one. Problem solved.
915353489462759424 2017-10-03 23:10:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s Let's make it so there are no places where a woman can get an abortion and then we can just ignore the law.
915353231961837568 2017-10-03 23:09:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s Yep. Fact based and calling out the hypocrisy of Republicans. Oh it's horrible women are having late term abortions, boo hoo.
915352394472595456 2017-10-03 23:06:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk @NoQuartersFor Was it the responsibility of the victims to get out of the way? Maybe they shouldn't go to concerts in case there's a well designed gun.
915351681298296833 2017-10-03 23:03:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk @NoQuartersFor Are you aware there are laws about bars allowing people to drink too much? Your point about the gun working as designed explains a lot.
915351092984197122 2017-10-03 23:01:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s Your party made late abortions a thing by denying a woman a safe abortion early in her term. Late abortions are on your head. Pro life? No.
915350718722248709 2017-10-03 22:59:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s There would be no late abortions if Republicans would stop the hypocrisy & get their fingers out of a woman's vagina.
915349345649782785 2017-10-03 22:54:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @qubrat1s You should be sad if Ann Wagner represents you in Congress. 2018 can't come soon enough.

914835000792637440 2017-10-02 12:50:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @thinkprogress @SafetyPinDaily What he should have done: call her & apologize for being slow to respond to crisis. But that would have been too presidential.
914741833217007616 2017-10-01 06:40:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @Arqahn But if they are striking because they are mad at the governor wouldn't he know & say something? Still thinking this is fake news.
914739053538500608 2017-10-01 06:29:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @Arqahn Still only finding this on questionable websites. Even governor who has no love for truckers has not said they are on strike.
914737129300877312 2017-10-01 06:21:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @Arqahn Checked out the Epoch Times, not totally reliable source. I will be interested if story pans out and disappointed in PR teamsters if true.
914735568445198336 2017-10-01 06:15:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @Arqahn Read that because of computers being down paperwork for shipments was being done by hand, taking a long time. Paperwork while people die?
914734856143343616 2017-10-01 06:12:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @Arqahn It was shown the mayor had reps at all meetings. Plus does it seem likely in crisis that truckers would do this to each other?
914734321935757312 2017-10-01 06:10:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @Arqahn Those food pallets in question were not federal relief but a private donation from a Hispanic food company.
914734002728251393 2017-10-01 06:09:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @Arqahn Questioning because there is misinformation in this article especially about food supplies & mayors reactions.
914731547839881216 2017-10-01 05:59:30 UTC <sally_dehner> Bothers me to see Fox on everywhere I go. This was part of the election propaganda scandal. I am joining this challenge.https://twitter.com/copicard2017/status/914613050954715136
914729789956685824 2017-10-01 05:52:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing But he is sure that he will get a tax cut. Two-faced hypocrisy.
914729090317504513 2017-10-01 05:49:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @Arqahn For you, rocket science needs to be explained.
914728932297060352 2017-10-01 05:49:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @Arqahn There are semi-truck drivers coping with washed out roads, fallen bridges, debris and downed power lines.
914728363658551297 2017-10-01 05:46:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @Arqahn Pay attention! There are NO striking truck drivers. There are truck drivers coping with family disaster like no phone, no water, no food.
914714547696566272 2017-10-01 04:51:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @politico @SafetyPinDaily As do we all.
914714165905936384 2017-10-01 04:50:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @JoeTheMailman So much wrong here. Many of your so-called filthy rich black players donate way more than some presidents I can name.
914711616154996736 2017-10-01 04:40:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt I hope YOU have learned something. Deplorables should not be wasting other people's time. :)
914709859957923840 2017-10-01 04:33:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Tweets done for tonight. A good day here proving trump supporters wear blinders and need help :)
914709499365220352 2017-10-01 04:31:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt You are so wrong and every comment you make proves it. That R&D comment is straight from big pharma textbook.
914708835457277952 2017-10-01 04:29:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt I pay taxes for infrastructure I never even use. It's just the way society works.
914708606615990272 2017-10-01 04:28:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Except we have Democratic socialism. There is no 100% capitalist society. Take infrastructure for example. We agree to be taxed for roads.
914707829558214656 2017-10-01 04:25:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt By 8 -10 years brutal training are you referring to doctors? There is profit & then obscene profit. & do insurance cos.have brutal training?
914707291659800576 2017-10-01 04:23:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Thank you capitalist apologist. You make my case. Insurance companies & for profit healthcare exist for one thing- to make money off us
914706848623841280 2017-10-01 04:21:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Stand by my belief. Capitalism, competition is not the answer. Healthcare must not profit off the patient. We are not their bottomline.
914706436822880256 2017-10-01 04:19:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Insurers are not paying within 45 days in many cases. Also bills are incorrect & patients must constantly be aware & fighting.
914705852380172289 2017-10-01 04:17:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Healthcare should never, ever be a for profit system. Capitalism is not the answer to everything.
914705620657479680 2017-10-01 04:16:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt That is why the ACA needed fine tuning. GOP will throw out baby with the bath water. Entire system needed overhaul GOP refused. Bottom line
914704985966940160 2017-10-01 04:13:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Capitalism works for insurance companies not patients. Get rid of the mandates, failure. You live in dream state. HSA is your own money!
914704432528576512 2017-10-01 04:11:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Insurance companies pay late (6 months to a yr), negotiate their own coverage scale & big pharma-when is trump going to step up & negotiate?
914703844537507841 2017-10-01 04:09:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt And the fewer doctor issue needs to be part of the discussion. Insurance companies need reining in not more autonomy.
914703327711105029 2017-10-01 04:07:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Premiums will continue to rise but without ACA you will have LESS coverage.
914702771458379777 2017-10-01 04:05:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Premiums which would have gone up anyway. One phrase for you-high risk pools. To know them is to hate them.
914701989795295232 2017-10-01 04:02:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Funny, my daughter is self employed, has insurance from the marketplace, working just fine. Most employed saw no change exc hiked premiums
914699000476991488 2017-10-01 03:50:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @commondreams @SafetyPinDaily Unhappy looking group. Is it too much to expect they are thinking "boy we really screwed up; should have sent more help to PR sooner."
914696013444677633 2017-10-01 03:38:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @Evan_Rosenfeld Thank heavens we have a travel ban against Egypt....oh wait.
914692139900133377 2017-10-01 03:22:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @rachel_maria65 Sometimes typos reveal inadvertent truths. :)
914691043198717953 2017-10-01 03:18:33 UTC <sally_dehner> Words are my weapons against stupidity, blindness and "trumpery". I will take up the sword any old time. Take care!
914690109244690433 2017-10-01 03:14:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @lsarsour @BBCJamesCook @CovfefePepe And by the way, don't call me a liar. That is reserved for tRump and trumpetts.
914688928170610688 2017-10-01 03:10:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk @eileendefreest When I heard Trump supposedly won the election my first words were "oh my God, the Supreme Court!"
914685978656288770 2017-10-01 02:58:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Obamacare is fine if Trump doesn't sabotage it, but of course.....
914685616851431424 2017-10-01 02:56:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Lot of stuff in our face right now, thrown by this administration (& it smells). By the way 3.25? Been there, done that, have tshirt.
914684530191212544 2017-10-01 02:52:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Obama didn't help create the mortgage crisis but like so many other issues the GOP & Wall Street left him to deal with it.
914683425180745728 2017-10-01 02:48:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @keithboykin Undecided on this. If he works he may screw even more things up. Maybe golf IS better.
914681282898034689 2017-10-01 02:39:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Ouch, pretty bad when you need defending by Geraldo Rivera.
914680973295538181 2017-10-01 02:38:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Do your research, don't comment about a system you apparently do not understand. Are you familiar with Medicare? Single payer for seniors:)
914680288747360256 2017-10-01 02:35:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt See when you say freeloaders you reveal your kinship with trump. Problem is you are not his kin. He's in it for himself & the 1%. Wake up!
914679657236193281 2017-10-01 02:33:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt When you define yourself as one of Trump's deplorable you make my case for me.
914679427342233600 2017-10-01 02:32:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt I recognize stupidity when I see it in Trump.  We can go tit for tat all day as I point out to you that you are blinding yourself to truth.
914678684908425217 2017-10-01 02:29:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Honey, the WH will need fumigating after trump & his team leave. He isn't cleaning house or draining the swamp. Wake up! It's all about him.
914678060657659904 2017-10-01 02:26:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Obama created the mortgage crisis? You people will throw any mud & see if it sticks. Remember when Obama didn't show up in LA after Katrina?
914676968968335361 2017-10-01 02:22:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Look at the graphs, you will see. After the trump budget & tax cuts hit you over the head you'll see stars not great numbers.
914676531452137472 2017-10-01 02:20:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt No I'm talking about buying insurance so WHEN you get sick it's there. Plenty of people have gambled over the years. Single payer/best bet.
914675528430432257 2017-10-01 02:16:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Look at the deficit graphs & you will see that it goes up & down every month. Shading by DT. Obama had surplus of 100 bn 1 mo in his last yr
914674179437400064 2017-10-01 02:11:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt No. Check how the gdp is calculated and you will see that as usual Mr. Trump is shading the facts. He couldn't tell the truth if he tried.
914672054598864896 2017-10-01 02:03:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt If only we could keep the GOP out of office with their tax cuts for the wealthy, trickle down economics & penchant for war. Hear the echo?
914671670241132544 2017-10-01 02:01:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Obama inherited a bigger economic mess than previous presidents. He went a long way to fixing it.
914671040336449536 2017-10-01 01:59:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt I am sure the Clinton's like the rest of America and the world look on with horror at what the deplorables have sown.
914670416895111169 2017-10-01 01:56:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Trump will have us bankrupt fiscally and morally.
914670202318655488 2017-10-01 01:55:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Everything Obama did made this country a better, more just place. It's going down the tubes with this reality tv personality.
914669484341948416 2017-10-01 01:52:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Your statement that no one can afford healthcare now is incorrect.
914669261490094085 2017-10-01 01:52:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Nice to not worry about pre-existing conditions. Medical bankruptcy at all time low. Women's healthcare covered at better level. Could go on
914668592976814080 2017-10-01 01:49:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt You maybe could afford healthcare, lucky. Many, many more could not. First time having majority of citizens covered. Appreciated other perks
914667897804517376 2017-10-01 01:46:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @lsarsour @BBCJamesCook @CovfefePepe Nothing more distasteful than a person trying to cover failures by blaming others. Why does the president do this constantly? Apologize!
914667115059310593 2017-10-01 01:43:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @lsarsour @BBCJamesCook @CovfefePepe I believe the president insinuated those things. And when it comes to corruption look no further than the WH. Always this man projects.
914629080020144129 2017-10-01 23:12:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt And don't forget those same Republican's plan to stymie anything Obama proposed. Reap what you sow, suckers.
914628839350956032 2017-10-01 23:11:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt As for the credit rating, look to the Republican Congress & ask them the definition of brinkmanship.
914628045708910592 2017-10-01 23:08:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Your idea of law & order dead, not mine. Border paranoia on your part. Violence, yes, against the poor & POC. Fake news everywhere on Fox!
914626449918832640 2017-10-01 23:01:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Compromised sovereignty? Alt right buzz word. Our sovereignty was fine but now it has been compromised by Trump's little Russian venture.
914625847998509057 2017-10-01 22:59:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt Healthcare better than ever, economy recovering after last GOP disaster. You want to see debt? Wait til Trump & his cronies get finished.
914622644523323392 2017-10-01 22:46:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt 1/That's hilarious. Trump working?? As a friend said, everything was going so well in the world, what happened?
914622337630302208 2017-10-01 22:45:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt 2/Here's what happened. Trump gave every racist, misogynistic, hateful person in America a free pass & said run with it.
914613193368002560 2017-10-01 22:09:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @bendy0123 The pictures of the voting places reminded me of our handicapped people being forcibly removed from a DC hearing. Government gone crazy.
914612698876440576 2017-10-01 22:07:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @bendy0123 Wow, I hope you don't ever get really mad.
914611736841465857 2017-10-01 22:03:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @guardian @SafetyPinDaily President needs to leave the mayor alone. She's got a lot of important work on her hands; no time for his childish games & name-calling.
914600534753017856 2017-10-01 21:18:54 UTC <sally_dehner> Oh, oh.
914600353760468992 2017-10-01 21:18:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt America hating? No, we love America so much we want to save it from disaster, Trump disaster. He IS awesome-awesomely horrible.
914592379059019776 2017-10-01 20:46:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @thinkprogress Am I the only one who would like to see Trump wading through dirty flood water looking for survivors? Contest between mayor/pres, she wins!
914561455608991745 2017-10-01 18:43:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @MADE__USA @KORANISBURNING @victoryvets And ABInBev says thanks for screwing up our consumer hotline. Sheesh.
914561038569181184 2017-10-01 18:41:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @XBeach_LivingX @KORANISBURNING Why do people insist on following what I call the "real" fake news? No boycott, ABInBev not worried & calls screwed up their consumer line.
914558772055506944 2017-10-01 18:32:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @ChrisMurphyCT Biggest waste of time? Trying to work with this useless excuse of a president.
914558117672886273 2017-10-01 18:30:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Though trump tweets R atrocious, hard not to laugh at the sight of his foot in mouth over & over. Love the old tweets that come back 2 bite.
914557374572179457 2017-10-01 18:27:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @jcvolt No Rose Q got it right. All the deplorables are sad and bitter. That is why they voted for Trump. Keep hoping they'll see the light but....
914555630651887617 2017-10-01 18:20:28 UTC <sally_dehner> Bite your tongue! Trump needs no suggestions; he will find another scumbag, excuse me, secretary on his own.https://twitter.com/resnickeli/status/914549146538962945
914488913590411264 2017-10-01 13:55:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @jkfecke Trump is the complete package. Can we return it for a refund?
914487511187156992 2017-10-01 13:49:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @chfortrump @sherryscorp @kaleidoskeith #goptrumpers twist & turn everything, they lie, they applaud evil. Just look at Puerto Rico & the lies & hate being spread by our own pres.
914486400573206529 2017-10-01 13:45:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @chfortrump Please it is too early on a Sunday for that meme. Nauseating.
914486110310604800 2017-10-01 13:44:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @chfortrump Pointing out the food was a donation from Goya, big Hispanic owned food company. Where was the help from US (& box cutters) to distribute.
914483312298647552 2017-10-01 13:33:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @AJVicens @g10710 @littlesummer17 That is untrue and hateful.
914478985970683904 2017-10-01 13:15:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @MotherJones @AJVicens @BluePeaceDove1 @Luissilv2000 @freezingsheep @XBeach_LivingX @stanley_shedd Well Mr. Shedd after reading your comments & your Twitter page, you & others are why we are in this mess. Shame on you, I will pray for you.
914473551985627138 2017-10-01 12:54:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @VABVOX @ChrisFollins No, no, no. She should not have to stroke his ego (or anything else) to get the help her people deserve.
914473041354215424 2017-10-01 12:52:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @deaconseps @VABVOX Comment: "she's standing in front of food, what's her problem?" It's food donated by Goya, Hispanic owned company. Needs help to distribute.
914470439719772160 2017-10-01 12:41:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @benshapiro @yashar @HunterPagon Sorry but Trump erased that line of respect even before the inauguration. We don't have enough hours in the day to criticize everything.
914469662355857408 2017-10-01 12:38:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @benshapiro @yashar @johnson_brandp What changed in 5 years? Now it's all repetitive DT tweets, lies, hypocrisy & tears. Of course the administration practically writes SNL.
914458811515187200 2017-10-01 11:55:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @amcalderon @trg4496 Well you win the award for the stupidest comment (so far) this morning. You might want to read a few DT tweets & rethink your statement.

914355508273991680 2017-09-30 05:05:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @shaz1er @yashar One word for this-nauseating.
914325016141074434 2017-09-30 03:04:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @HuffPostPol @SafetyPinDaily More like a hurdy-gurdy missing a wheel.

914323777005158400 2017-09-30 02:59:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @lsarsour @BBCJamesCook @CovfefePepe Oo, you're buying the DT narrative. Corrupt mayor, lazy citizens brought hurricane on themselves, stealing our taxpayer money. U R gullible.
914320905261785089 2017-09-30 02:47:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @Newsweek @SafetyPinDaily Several reasons. They are women. Many if not all are women of color & by virtue of their sport they are strong. DT can't handle that combo.
914318816947077121 2017-09-30 02:39:27 UTC <sally_dehner> The elderly, children and the sick are going to pay for his incompetence. He should be praying instead of golfing.https://twitter.com/cmehigh/status/914307919604273152
914248360420356096 2017-09-30 21:59:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Given Trump & his administration's need to travel on private jets, can you imagine them coping with a real disaster?
914248055184076801 2017-09-30 21:58:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Is it rude & unChristian to wish Trump & his supporters would find themselves in a disaster up a creek without a paddle?
914221403481755649 2017-09-30 20:12:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei Interesting because so called fake news has boots on the ground in Puerto Rico, not only reporting but in some instances helping as well.
914220353697796098 2017-09-30 20:08:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @BI_contributors @SafetyPinDaily Guess we will just have to work harder to make Alabamans see they don't have to be represented by this ......(insert expletive).
914219701802295296 2017-09-30 20:05:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @nastywoman60 @shannonrwatts I didn't complain about Obama golfing because he didn't do it 66 times in 9 months spending over 55 million dollars or do it during a crisis
914195225798676480 2017-09-30 18:28:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing From comments, I can see she gets no honor from her own country. The comparison between her & the disaster in the WH does make me nauseous.
914194293052645377 2017-09-30 18:24:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @Salon @SafetyPinDaily Future presidents will pay for this man's lazy, entitled butt. We will frown anytime a pres takes time off remembering the laziness of DT.

914172585230954496 2017-09-30 16:58:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @shannonrwatts @LoneAmerican That is the stupidest comment yet. Don't you get it? The people have lost infrastructure & can't just come & unpack supplies. They need help
914170807026413568 2017-09-30 16:51:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @Salon @SafetyPinDaily Part of difficulty is America was already great & it's harder to ruin it than the GOP thought.

914132540197412864 2017-09-30 14:19:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk So devastated PR's are lazy & want everything handed to them? DT admin wasting our money & expecting everything to be handed to them-worse.

914128465858908160 2017-09-30 14:03:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing That was inevitable the minute she said anything uncomplimentary about his management style. If he could he'd say "you're fired".
914127715955089409 2017-09-30 14:00:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @NBCNews @stlredbirds85 @AllBungled @indoeuropa Were Houston & Florida asked to send affected citizens to help unload trucks full of supplies? I think help is 2 prong. Supplies & manpower.
914127042626678786 2017-09-30 13:57:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @NBCNews @stlredbirds85 @AllBungled @indoeuropa No one is denigrating your service but along with flying in supplies how about people to unload & a plan to disperse?
913975534471860232 2017-09-29 03:55:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @TomiLahren @FoxNews @danadoo1 That comment makes me laugh. So a healthy lunch is an inedible lunch. Eating poorly lowers intelligence; trump supporters provide proof.

913862546020593665 2017-09-29 20:26:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @kylegriffin1 Wonder if this is how Congress feels about the president "we have done a wonderful job, considering we have nothing to work with."

913778175448113152 2017-09-29 14:51:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @Metro_US @SafetyPinDaily Should read "I can guarantee taxes will go up for the middle class" with "tax break for wealthy requires major reduction in budget"

913763312277639168 2017-09-29 13:52:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @Timtravels007 @mikealfinito Well it's a preexisting condition, so under trumpnocare there would be no hope for your desire.
913762685224972288 2017-09-29 13:49:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @Timtravels007 @mikealfinito Suggest you take closer look at economic growth during Obama. Yes, we heard the shaded comments during the campaign. Trump is so full of shi
913761876839890945 2017-09-29 13:46:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @Timtravels007 @mikealfinito Trump words are third grade at best, but his actions? Veers everyday between disastrous or nonexistent. Best hope for America is Mueller.
913610459101765633 2017-09-28 03:44:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @Timtravels007 @mikealfinito I long for a president that speaks in full, coherent sentences, does the job with grace, & doesn't regard taxpayer funds as golf money.
913609423255457792 2017-09-28 03:40:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @Timtravels007 @mikealfinito Well right now we'd be a lot better off if she was president instead of the psycho baby we ended up with.
913573054760017920 2017-09-28 01:16:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @Timtravels007 Sad thing is ...Trump doesn't drink. Have no idea what his excuse is for all the crap he pulls.
913572685430628352 2017-09-28 01:14:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @Timtravels007 @mikealfinito Damn, her losing to Trump is the reason most of us started drinking.
913571421032509441 2017-09-28 01:09:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @thehill @SafetyPinDaily White House seeks to explain-the number one phrase since January. Unfortunately it is not possible to explain lies aka alternate facts,
913568158384082949 2017-09-28 00:56:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu Trump has an agenda? I thought it was all about self-centered random tweets and hair gel.
913564913204961281 2017-09-28 00:43:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @EvensonGary @gerryblevins Out of country on election day but friends say Hillary winning til late in the day. Odd, last states to report are quite blue.
913564081700900865 2017-09-28 00:40:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @EvensonGary @gerryblevins Actually this poll is very much evidence of hacking & interference. The figures are odd; trending negative over  rumor & innuendo.
913563113382957056 2017-09-28 00:36:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @EvensonGary @gerryblevins Right; the GOP had no standards to speak of. The DNC stuck to it's guns & then wrote many of Bernie's ideas into the platform. Win!Win!
913509139837587456 2017-09-28 21:02:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @CNNPolitics This administration is in our crosshairs as we find more & more examples of an entitlement attitude. Taxpayer money is not your slush fund.

913478848968261633 2017-09-28 19:01:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @CNN Greg you can say that but the rest of us see the truth. Another bigly administration screwup. Maga drowned in the swamp back in January.
913474650558156801 2017-09-28 18:45:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @EvensonGary @gerryblevins You miss the point, Bernie is not a Dem, he's an Independent. DNC not required to accept him, Stein or Johnson to run on THEIR ticket.
913443462695055361 2017-09-28 16:41:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing @EvensonGary But was it Hillary's problem or the fact our election was hijacked on many fronts & in the end the electoral college refused to do it's job?

913142591130136576 2017-09-27 20:45:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @Shareblue So, no humanitarian efforts unless they are approved by the people who really run our country, i.e. big business.  Trump is powerless?

913068686868611072 2017-09-27 15:51:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump Actually support growing everyday. The backlash? That is in response to your presidency & especially the likelihood you stole the election.

912810781326102528 2017-09-26 22:47:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @yashar Our president is trying to equate people who use their first amendment right with people who are unpatriotic. Clueless.  Just his usual MO.
912791345999294465 2017-09-26 21:29:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @yashar If Trump keeps this up he'll find the majority of the nation kneeling for the anthem.

912729979196231680 2017-09-26 17:25:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly The president has free speech rights.  That is good because it shows us what he believes in.  That's why we don't like him.

912454290010251265 2017-09-25 23:10:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @MikePajak reading some of your retweets & tweets.  We won't be friends anytime soon but you did give me a laugh for the day.

911704931962368000 2017-09-23 21:32:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @Hegemommy Takes a lot of gall to make a speech like that knowing you shouldn't even be on the Supreme Court.
911623684049264640 2017-09-23 16:09:58 UTC <sally_dehner> Notice the times the system will be down.  Very telling.https://twitter.com/SurlyAmy/status/911608289137270784
911622044940472320 2017-09-23 16:03:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @Slate @SafetyPinDaily The attitude of privilege & entitlement is so strong with this administration.  The only place they want to save money is when it affects us
911620481912107008 2017-09-23 15:57:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei Apparently Mr. Trump doesn't quite get the fact that visiting HIM in the White House is not such an honor.
911600267132592129 2017-09-23 14:36:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @schmooey There is a SOB that disrespects our nation & it's citizens. His name is Donald Trump. He should be fired, the president said so.
911428301754916864 2017-09-22 03:13:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC Maybe you should take another look at the kind of person he is and figure out why he's opposed to your latest bill??
911314571150929921 2017-09-22 19:41:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @Independent @SafetyPinDaily I thought it was God telling Houston developers to shape up and quit building in flood plains for a change. (Just kidding).
911238196394110976 2017-09-22 14:38:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @SmithInAmerica @SafetyPinDaily That strange sound you are hearing?  Laughter coming from all directions of our nation.pic.twitter.com/A1yFAyt6uO
910678811766935552 2017-09-20 01:35:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark Well Trump missed the class on empathy and morality. His adult kids don't seem to have learned those lessons either.
910621575086526464 2017-09-20 21:47:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @Newsweek @SafetyPinDaily Ah Paul you are so silly or dumb or scared sh...less. Not sure which.
910577517140103169 2017-09-20 18:52:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenateGOP @kelleAbond @SenBobCasey Where the rubber meets the road. Who counts? What's more important, your constituents or your party.
910577090935783426 2017-09-20 18:51:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @HuffPostPol @SafetyPinDaily Just wait until there is something this man wants to stand up for then let's see if all lives splatter.
910576346069389312 2017-09-20 18:48:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @Slate @Klllmanjaro Also will need to add results of N. Korea & other poor international policies. Best case scenario for Anerica? Impeachment double quick.
910575756580966401 2017-09-20 18:45:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @Slate @Klllmanjaro We'll have a better count in the future: rejected asylum seekers, trumpcare casualties, citizen victims of poor water/air quality etc., etc.
910573164970770435 2017-09-20 18:35:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @Slate @Klllmanjaro Even with faults,  Bush & Obama were more admirable leaders than Trump can ever hope to be. Can't hardly keep up with his swampiness.
910498082663657472 2017-09-20 13:37:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @ALT_uscis Quote from Lana del Fenty "would you suck dick or let your mama die?" Is this a description of the new trumpcare bill?
910496495614472192 2017-09-20 13:30:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk No one but the least desirables of his base wants a wall & he's using campaign funds to defend himself because one lawyer will not be enough

910285778026221568 2017-09-19 23:33:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis Protesters are not the agitators. Good cops are tarnished by the bad apples.    But what is going on right now makes even good cops look bad
910285145424498690 2017-09-19 23:31:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis I feel bad for those affected but fact is those people are probably among the ones this protest is about.  Racism in this city needs to die.
910141474188259328 2017-09-19 14:00:11 UTC <sally_dehner> So true & it makes me so angry that my country has it's priorities so messed up.https://twitter.com/libshipwreck/status/910140412391772160
910141041201881088 2017-09-19 13:58:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis Businesses hurting? I believe that standing up for our city, calling out racism & holding police accountable for their actions is good.
910083492997976064 2017-09-19 10:09:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis I like to think that no one would ever drive through protesters but it has happened. Lack of respect for those who protest worries me.
909832102077714432 2017-09-18 17:30:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis If a bank needed to be pointed out for racist policies I would picket (maybe by standing in the street) not rob it. Sheesh.
909831841238208512 2017-09-18 17:29:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis If you think those two things are comparable there is no hope for you.
909830937382354949 2017-09-18 17:26:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis Thanks to Rich Sutton on Facebook for the link to kettling.
909830740061429760 2017-09-18 17:25:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis Thank you for recognizing that I am a law abiding citizen who believes unequivocally in the first amendment.
909830417154535425 2017-09-18 17:24:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis I am wondering Jim whether you would drive through a protest because the traffic law said you had the right of way.
909827850311741440 2017-09-18 17:13:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis The right to free speech trumps traffic laws.
909827422656323585 2017-09-18 17:12:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis Sometimes civil laws need to be superseded by civil protest.
909822588687458305 2017-09-18 16:53:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis Oh, so the first amendment meant to say peaceable assembly only on sidewalks. I guess we need to rewrite it.
909817763128111104 2017-09-18 16:33:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis Excuse me, I'm a liar? I pointed out that blocking traffic, legal or not, is the result of poor decisions in handling peaceful marches.
909802678783488001 2017-09-18 15:33:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis Are you suggesting protesters are being paid? I know many & no one gets money for standing up to hatred.
909802197193515011 2017-09-18 15:32:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis It is not a right for cops in riot gear to stop peaceful protests either. Keep it up & people stop traffic & eventually you get violence.
909801746616274947 2017-09-18 15:30:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC @RoyBlunt You say quality care and this bill in same sentence with a straight face? Think again & do the right thing for us. This bill stinks.
909801305971052544 2017-09-18 15:28:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @weeklystandard @RoyBlunt How many times do your constituents have to tell you the same thing? Republican plans for healthcare are appalling & not what we need! NO!
909800422440886272 2017-09-18 15:24:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Kellyanne and mindless-perfect together in a sentence.
909800090549854209 2017-09-18 15:23:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @taznotes @Walaitis Whose streets? Our streets. And we have a guaranteed right to march in them; the police have a job to protect those streets not claim them.
909799551808221184 2017-09-18 15:21:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench @Walaitis The police are not a crowd protesting. They have a job & this was not impressive.
909799231111786496 2017-09-18 15:20:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @AntonioFrench 1. They are supposed to protect "our" streets. 2. Not a bright chant in light of circumstances.
909484763597086720 2017-09-17 18:30:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner I do not like what I'm hearing about the latest attempt to kill the ACA. You owe your constituents REAL healthcare assurance.
908901805492490240 2017-09-15 03:54:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark Bummer, I didn't see a single moose all day today. But loving the park anyhow.
907950596153638912 2017-09-13 12:54:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @ProudResister Sarah, Sarah, you forget she won the popular vote, America lost. And by negative did you mean she mentioned deplorables? If the shoe fits.
907818090150408192 2017-09-12 04:07:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag @jamesbPDog Correct. I was out of the country Election Day. When I heard Trump won, I immediately stopped & said "oh God, the Supreme Court is ruined."
907791733337051136 2017-09-12 02:23:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @johnrutledge This sort of thing makes me uncomfortable. Never cared for Anne Geddes for that reason.
907447552223711233 2017-09-11 03:35:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 My mean side wishes a person like him could magically be transported to Barbuda to live out the rest of his life.
907427523696513024 2017-09-11 02:15:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing So "impressed" with Trump jobs program. Of course they are jobs for lawyers for WH employees (and former employees) and family members.
907342807769239552 2017-09-11 20:39:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 Trump's base would lose their right to vote if there were a literacy test. That said-all citizens have the right because all laws affect us.
907286585280024577 2017-09-11 16:55:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Well if the 9/11 statue was of Osama Bin Laden with an inscription commemorating his role then we would take it down. Get it?
907250591566635009 2017-09-11 14:32:51 UTC <sally_dehner> In remembrance of Timothy Haviland who died in tower one on 9/11. RIP.
907248157481893893 2017-09-11 14:23:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @CNNPolitics @HusrtMiMi @FizgigPE Fox is an entertainment system, not news. WH could have checked sources, we pay them enough to do their jobs. MSM reports; doesn't invent.

906888091268472834 2017-09-10 14:32:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk Independent Trump combines the worst of Republicans/Democrats with a healthy dose of failing, flailing businessman w/splash of entitlement.

904433361472638976 2017-09-03 19:58:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @Lil_Gold_Devil Listen to Senator Pence speech and then tell me that he was encouraging a yes vote on Katrina.
904432564995280896 2017-09-03 19:55:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @Lil_Gold_Devil Insinuated Pence voted no. Pence voted yes & insinuated it was a bad idea that would harm our children/grandchildren. Crickets on wall as VP
904325175788933120 2017-09-03 12:48:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @Lil_Gold_Devil No, conversation started because the VP, when a senator, cautioned America about the cost of Katrina but is silent on the cost of the wall.
904209569269911552 2017-09-02 05:08:55 UTC <sally_dehner> When are Eric, Junior and Ivanka going to make their donations? Surely each of their families wants to be as generous as Dad. https://twitter.com/parkermolloy/status/903595831974088704
904204214427115521 2017-09-02 04:47:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @Lil_Gold_Devil If our government cannot or will not help in rebuilding after a disaster we have no right to contemplate building a wall we can't afford.
904203657331269634 2017-09-02 04:45:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @Lil_Gold_Devil I think we talk at cross purposes. Not all Harvey disaster relief will be government money but the biggest percentage will be.
904096279696900096 2017-09-02 21:38:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil Amount, not Amy. Don't know how she got in the discussion.
904095856449785857 2017-09-02 21:37:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil I believe the rebuilding of Houston will cost more than the infamous wall. How much can American taxpayers take? My vote? Houston, no wall.
904095148728078337 2017-09-02 21:34:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil Sorry you didn't like but there is no such thing as money without regards to origin especially of that Amy. & the wall wants a blank check.
904090415397294085 2017-09-02 21:15:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil Two things-where would a grant of such largesse come from & would 50B even cover a wall build? Really, who would we be beholden to?
904066634800918528 2017-09-02 19:40:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil The useless wall will impact our children/grandchildren. Should be deep-sixed or come with funding red flag-this boondoggle will ruin us.
904066012148064257 2017-09-02 19:38:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil 1/ You can try to separate Pence in Congress after Katrina from the WH admin today but the lesson is there.
903831927588868097 2017-09-01 04:08:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil Pence said about Katrina-funding must not be a catastrophe for our children & grandchildren. Bingo! Funding the wall would be a catastrophe.
903802785887641601 2017-09-01 02:12:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil Bright people know Mexico will never pay & taxpayers will be taken for a joyride. Eventually we will own a useless piece of expensive junk.
903801059608584192 2017-09-01 02:05:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @ShayKcMisses81 @Lil_Gold_Devil Glad that someone recognizes there are NO funds for a wall. Now let's acknowledge that Houston rebuilding is way more important.
903800015570829312 2017-09-01 02:01:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil Big correlation to today. Pence says re Katrina funds: yes but must find way for Congress to fund. Where is the warning about wall funding?
903676077884760064 2017-09-01 17:49:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil Did you suggest I have poor logic? Perhaps I should get a job at the WH then. I could spend all day being satiric & no one would know.
903576178447048704 2017-09-01 11:12:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @thinkprogress @SafetyPinDaily @DrewDawg Check out the Bakker website for the hurricane relief specials from the Morningside store.
903559473981255682 2017-09-01 10:05:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @sinnsage @GavinNewsom @Lil_Gold_Devil No problem funding Harvey relief since there is apparently money for "the wall" so we can just use that. Problem solved!
903552302803546112 2017-09-01 09:37:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @kelleAbond @DustinGiebel Incredible generosity? That would be a minimum wage worker donating $100. Eric has a warped idea of incredible when it comes to his family.
903549142357684224 2017-09-01 09:24:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @thinkprogress @SafetyPinDaily It will be hard to fight us when we are busy laughing, celebrating and dancing in the streets. They will have to take away our champagne.
903472802174402561 2017-08-31 04:21:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @thinkprogress @SafetyPinDaily @DrewDawg Wondering that myself. Autographed picture of Bakker? Copy of a cherry-picked Bible signed by Joel Osteen? Wait, they're competitors.
903341508430049281 2017-08-31 19:39:33 UTC <sally_dehner> Missouri GOP apparently suffers from advanced hypocrisy syndrome aided & abetted by a clueless commander-in-chief.https://twitter.com/missourigop/status/902978507558367232
903339480169431041 2017-08-31 19:31:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @Independent @SafetyPinDaily Eric: we take what your family says with a grain of salt because today's comment contradicts yesterday's & will prove to be a lie tomorrow.
902982005129957381 2017-08-30 19:51:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers @hillsteven884 Change that to reality TV Christian. Just like our president, the reality TV potus. In it for the fame and the money.
902909876728451072 2017-08-30 15:04:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @ChrisMurphyCT Well who would know fraud better than a former dean of DeVry University? It takes one to know one?
902902974833360896 2017-08-30 14:36:58 UTC <sally_dehner> Recently had a 20 tweet dialogue w/45 supporter & admirer of Arpaio. She ended up invoking Obama & Bill Clinton. Still shaking my head.
902656863975690240 2017-08-29 22:19:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @vickimorris191 I have not been called out rather you have convicted yourself. I told you I have no time to respond to someone full of unchanging hate.
902653398440443908 2017-08-29 22:05:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @vickimorris191 The hate is all on your side, obvious from your comments & the admiration of someone disgusting like Arpaio. This conversation is now over.
902638385017257984 2017-08-29 21:05:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @vickimorris191 Envy someone? Not me. Feel sorry for some, admire others. For you? Have to admire your one track mind. Laugh but admire.
902637488665235457 2017-08-29 21:02:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @DisavowTrump16 @vickimorris191 Oh, damn, I hope I am one of the strong women you were referring to. We strong women stick together & kick ass.
902636521450336257 2017-08-29 20:58:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @DisavowTrump16 @vickimorris191 If the shoe fits YOU, wear it.
902635579594219520 2017-08-29 20:54:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenKamalaHarris @vickimorris191 Obama-warm, loving, strict but forgiving. Arpaio-none of those things. Don't imagine Obama is his fan anymore than I am.
902634558373466113 2017-08-29 20:50:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @SallyQYates @vickimorris191 You caused me to research Obama pardons & clemency. I am impressed & delighted with his decisions. Also for his press for prison reform. Wow
902631370979201024 2017-08-29 20:37:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 Arpaio fakes an assassination attempt, treats humans like scum (pictures don't lie) & flaunts the rule of law. No fudging, outright disgust.
902630545171111937 2017-08-29 20:34:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 Yes, Clinton's brother did the crime & SERVED his time. Arpaio totally off the hook, no time, for a crime against humanity. Disgusting.
902590701053063168 2017-08-29 17:56:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @thedailybeast @SafetyPinDaily That's understandable. They did the same thing during the Hillary Clinton investigations. Oh, wait...
902573103238262785 2017-08-29 16:46:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 Frankly don't see drug offenses as anything near the horror that Arpaio chose to inflict on fellow human beings. And then he broke the law.
902572712681500673 2017-08-29 16:44:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 Breaking the law is breaking the law. That is why Arpaio needed a pardon. There are levels of crime or everyone would get the death sentence
902374796159328256 2017-08-28 03:38:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @bannerite @johnlundin @markmobility @Shannon_Skinner Can't be badly flooded; I just saw they are collecting diapers, baby food etc., tomorrow (Tuesday). Very confusing.
902374493238255616 2017-08-28 03:36:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @bannerite @mchastain81 @markmobility @Tinynikki @newstef Confused.  1st they said church was inaccessible due to flooding but now it will be open Tuesday to collect diapers, baby food etc. ??
902373238373842944 2017-08-28 03:31:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis Well, they've already killed the English language.  Maybe they need ESL classes? People who have murdered English should not have guns.
902278123714203649 2017-08-28 21:14:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @EdKrassen Also ask him about proposed cuts in FEMA funds, elimination of government proposals to insure buildings & roads are protected from flooding.
902275824140869632 2017-08-28 21:04:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 Clinton's brother did his time for a cocaine offense; the pardon removed his criminal record. Doesn't come close to what 45 did this weekend
902275282391969793 2017-08-28 21:02:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 One person President Obama pardoned was guilty of violating the clean water act.  Wouldn't need pardoning now-not a violation anymore.
902275083204513792 2017-08-28 21:01:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 President Obama pardoned mostly people with drug sentences not proportional to the crime.
902203485705383936 2017-08-28 16:17:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 So Arpaio was pardoned for .....fun? Don't need no pardon if you don't commit a crime.
902192672005394432 2017-08-28 15:34:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @chellenelson17 @Enrique_Acevedo Best thing to do is detour around the president. Lots of people doing it; he's like an annoying roadblock.
902192208828354560 2017-08-28 15:32:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 See how weird that is? You have proof of a crime & say "nope, not believing it" & you wonder why we shake our collective heads.
902029521603497984 2017-08-27 04:46:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 A response of "will not" believe is telling.  This is the problem-you will not be swayed no matter how many times you are shown facts.
901973411542339584 2017-08-27 01:03:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @chellenelson17 @ChrisCJackson The president needs to remember not everyone in MO supports him. Those signs you see in Springfield won't all be love messages. #Resist
901972367857123328 2017-08-27 00:59:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 I do not hate you but I am appalled at your support of a man who has no empathy or humanity & yes, who violated our constitution.
901971701650644997 2017-08-27 00:56:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 Your statement is correct in regard to Arpaio. He dehumanized men & women to justify his hate.
901908611550588931 2017-08-27 20:45:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 No proof of shackling? Read a little more & you will be appalled that a law officer could be so inhumane.
901866706280349696 2017-08-27 17:59:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 Sorry, I am calling that a lie.  Shackling a woman to a bed while giving birth is torture.  Not willing to call him a human being.
901778293451620353 2017-08-27 12:07:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @vickimorris191 There is a line between not coddling criminals & desiring to torture them. Arpaio stepped over that line & became the thing he hated.
901601455441891329 2017-08-26 00:25:12 UTC <sally_dehner> Obama pardoned mostly people with harsh sentences for drug crimes. One person violated clean water act, probably not a crime now:(
901563018705862657 2017-08-26 21:52:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @BillKristol Arpaio=the wrong person to pardon.  45* has stirred the hornet's nest.  No one he pardons will escape the sting.
901557899100655619 2017-08-26 21:32:07 UTC <sally_dehner> My stand: Arpaio was NOT an American patriot, to suggest this tarnishes Americans everywhere. President Trump-we condemn your action.https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/901552686918664192
901556872410431488 2017-08-26 21:28:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU To call Arpaio an American patriot is an insult to Americans.  We do not condone the things this man did & we condemn 45* who pardoned him.
901438230926688259 2017-08-26 13:36:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @SpeakerRyan @travelinlady99 @goldengateblond So racists & nutcases are the presidential advisors. Explains a lot.
901205483176034305 2017-08-25 22:11:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @ChelseaClinton Well done, Ms Clinton.

900722772074221569 2017-08-24 14:13:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @altruisticlmj I hate math jokes but I did laugh at this one.
900721821611372544 2017-08-24 14:09:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @MotherJones @shaz1er @RWPUSA Is that a new form of insider trading?
900556839041060864 2017-08-23 03:14:16 UTC <sally_dehner> Well if anybody understands fake news it is our president.  Everything about him is fake.https://twitter.com/AltYelloNatPark/status/900538721929277440
900336111511379968 2017-08-23 12:37:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @WilDonnelly This is why so many say #NotMyPresident.
900333596178821123 2017-08-23 12:27:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @Newsweek @SafetyPinDaily @honkeygranny I don't believe that, but they are allowing some "bat shit crazy" people to shanghai their party. They need to stand up & fight or go down.
900128056479711232 2017-08-22 22:50:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @HuffPostPol @SafetyPinDaily Instead of making America great again, this administration is making it a place no one will want to live in.
900006038199558144 2017-08-22 14:45:35 UTC <sally_dehner> Cute Ms. Linton. Did you just have the gall to suggest you are sacrificing for our country? Wisdom & humanity in a message? Wasn't in yours.https://twitter.com/margarita/status/899806489686179840
899804366651236353 2017-08-21 01:24:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @DavidCornDC President Trump refers not to do comedy shows.
899789422144651264 2017-08-21 00:24:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @RandyRainbow Totally worth waiting for. Two fantastic things today-total eclipse and a Randy Rainbow video.
899665322902528000 2017-08-21 16:11:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @qz @SafetyPinDaily Appreciate characterization of Bannon Broadcasting as crazier version of Fox :)
899481222409277440 2017-08-20 04:00:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @Mediaite @BrianFi53970293 Finally you all admit what the rest of us always knew. Fox News was Fake News & bad entertainment at that. Bannon TV? Oh Lordy, even worse.
899251010434064384 2017-08-20 12:45:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @yountzee_ Not your kind of music but look at old hymn "Just as I Am."
899250817202520064 2017-08-20 12:44:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @yountzee_ Sometimes people with learning & authority completely miss the obvious. You need not accept what they say or don't say. You are you & strong
899021583003643904 2017-08-19 21:33:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @Bella_ofA Rally? What rally? Did anybody see a rally? Can it be a counter protest if there are no protesters?  Looks like Boston had a good time.
899020597816119296 2017-08-19 21:29:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Limbaugh has always been part of the problem. That the ayatollah pence is a fan-no surprise. Racial divisiveness is the Rush shtick.
899013023347736578 2017-08-19 20:59:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @jonfavs Always a day late and a dollar short as my grandmother would say.
898993443183013888 2017-08-19 19:41:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump Anti-police agitators?! Are you bonkers?  Oh, wait, were you talking about the 20 white supremacists gathered for the Hate Speech Rally?
898992370443837442 2017-08-19 19:37:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk Rambo is afraid of the crowd? Yeah, guess it's hard to walk through a group of peaceful protesters; they might hit you with a smirk.
898972719336665088 2017-08-19 18:19:33 UTC <sally_dehner> My thoughts exactly.https://twitter.com/jus10p/status/898965022956634113
898947168177926144 2017-08-19 16:38:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @yountzee_ Does this have anything to do with the fact you seem to still be at home?
898943850768719872 2017-08-19 16:24:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @madisonjroberts That is some scary antifa.  Resist!
898943637798694913 2017-08-19 16:23:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @yountzee_ Wait, did you topple a confederate statue?
898943072570142721 2017-08-19 16:21:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @KeithOlbermann Is this equivalent to his thanks to Putin for cutting the embassy staff?

898906545618132995 2017-08-19 13:56:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @yountzee_ Godspeed! And have a great school year. Love to read your tweets.
898756297235079168 2017-08-18 03:59:34 UTC <sally_dehner> That was my first question. How much did Nestle pay for this?https://twitter.com/BCAppelbaum/status/898692104519430144

898697477892620288 2017-08-18 00:05:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @TrickFreee Wait, if drump enemies include senators/reps, media, corporate America, plus he forgot to count us alt-left senior citizens. Big numbers.
898599015431798784 2017-08-18 17:34:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @SmithInAmerica @SafetyPinDaily Why would they speak against this? It's not like they're Jewish or anything ....oh wait.
898598622219993088 2017-08-18 17:33:01 UTC <sally_dehner> Stock market has risen on exit of Bannon? Just think where it could go if 45* resigns!
898597683333537795 2017-08-18 17:29:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark And we are going to have to fight to keep our national parks beautiful.
898582429123792898 2017-08-18 16:28:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @SecretaryZinke @AltYelloNatPark Wonder how much Nestle (biggest seller of bottled water in the world) paid for this decision.
898564511526932480 2017-08-18 15:17:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @NBCNews @SafetyPinDaily That would not surprise me. The alt-right are bullies and love to intimidate.
898563914215993344 2017-08-18 15:15:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @impeach_d_trump We should use the "Durham Defense" i.e. overwhelm his office with calls that we are anti-trump protesters & we resent loss of civil rights.
898562582839123968 2017-08-18 15:09:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @impeach_d_trump Sickening but not surprising.
898562294077988864 2017-08-18 15:08:40 UTC <sally_dehner> Well, Hillary has never been afraid to point out the truth. She nailed drump & pence less than a year ago. Prophecy fulfilled.https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/775800400188506112
898528908483502081 2017-08-18 12:56:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing What if the narrative flipped & she said she couldn't serve someone who was a bigot? Some people would have to eat at home forever.
898527110268018688 2017-08-18 12:48:51 UTC <sally_dehner> If 45*was waiting for the facts around Cville he should have tried getting the real story of the so-called violent alt-left. I'm with them.https://twitter.com/safetypindaily/status/898523645986824192
898524654171586560 2017-08-18 12:39:05 UTC <sally_dehner> Check out 1% for Art in Anchorage; love it. Art speaks to & for the citizens of the world. Moving, funny, scary, confusing even hateful. https://twitter.com/rubot/status/898184646588063745
898317593303367680 2017-08-17 22:56:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers Laughing so incredibly hard. Always thought he was lucky he had money otherwise he'd be like the dudes marching in Cville, no girlfriend.
898309118640799744 2017-08-17 22:22:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @Eagle1FL @Veteran_4_Trump Curious, are you one of the 1%? Tax reform won't be much help if you are not part of the inner circle.
898308735658934272 2017-08-17 22:21:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @Eagle1FL @Veteran_4_Trump You think life is better and more people have food on the table? This very moment life in the US is worse. We have an idiot as prez!
898308106412675074 2017-08-17 22:18:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @Eagle1FL @Veteran_4_Trump You think that was result of drump bombastic words??? Severe vision problem; need an eye doctor. Hope it's not classified as preexisting.
898307593969336320 2017-08-17 22:16:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @Eagle1FL @Veteran_4_Trump Wrong. Military budget did not double, many projects were actually started under Obama. 90% of military admire drump? Worried about them.
898306126252457984 2017-08-17 22:10:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @Eagle1FL @Veteran_4_Trump The economy is not moving "again", it was moving & had for quite awhile. What's about to happen is instability & uncertainty trashing it.
898305364160118784 2017-08-17 22:07:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @Eagle1FL @Veteran_4_Trump I care about what he's doing also. He's killing our nation, making us look like jackasses to the world, making some richer but most poorer.
898296714444001280 2017-08-17 21:33:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @Veteran_4_Trump BTW Mr. Veteran, you admit tRump is all BS? So BS is good if it makes you money? Hmmmm.
898296114482434048 2017-08-17 21:30:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @Veteran_4_Trump I hope you have the timing right. That tRump bubble just might burst anytime.
898294602750459904 2017-08-17 21:24:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @Veteran_4_Trump But I hope everyone who voted for tRump is beginning to experience buyer's remorse.
898292002365644800 2017-08-17 21:14:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @Veteran_4_Trump I'll bite. No, because hurricanes are forces of nature & Nazis & white supremacists are vile mutations of the American spirit.
898289847517024256 2017-08-17 21:06:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @timkaine @PDreams4ever @majortominor @SilviatbSilvia Conversation was about why no WH rep at Heather's memorial. Pence was out of country, danger for drump. Both men racist & not wanted.
898272764515295234 2017-08-17 19:58:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark Is this officially official? I'm good with it.
898218018261565441 2017-08-17 16:20:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump No misrepresentation of your stance would be necessary. Just quoting your own words convicts you quite nicely.
898213687906926592 2017-08-17 16:03:25 UTC <sally_dehner> Thank God for that! Only white supremacists see the beauty in hatred and want it back.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/898172999945392131
898213300755996672 2017-08-17 16:01:53 UTC <sally_dehner> Statues. Beautiful white power message for you & your ilk. Hate message in stone hidden in plain sight for others. Your view? Sad, very sad.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/898169407213645824
898205032222515200 2017-08-17 15:29:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers Could the tearing down of this statue be classified as a love crime?

898168856467959808 2017-08-17 13:05:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis Violent alt_left member here. Observed 4 hummingbirds duking it out at my feeder. Made me so angry I poured a 2nd cup of coffee. Tough day.
898165457978523650 2017-08-17 12:51:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Drump set the bar low so who knows. His suggested cabinet isn't much worse than what we've got now.
898027075742961665 2017-08-16 03:41:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @imsodope91 @TheRickyDavila @kcraighead10 @pattyhebs Suggest you investigate Trump Foundation if you wish to see crime & a useless organization that doesn't help anybody not named trump.
898024967446704129 2017-08-16 03:33:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @DrGW0 @Kopstar1969 Drump stands up for terrorists if they are white. Apparently they are some really nice people.
898024160458403840 2017-08-16 03:30:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark Your pictures are the saving grace of my day.
898014755482460160 2017-08-16 02:52:56 UTC <sally_dehner> And they said they planned a peaceful demonstration. Righhhttt. I can feel the love NOT.https://twitter.com/barry_corindia/status/897869376891699201
898013227761774592 2017-08-16 02:46:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @FBI @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @ChrisMurphyCT @ReginaPatton20 @KollanKolthoff Probably not as high on the list as some of you. But heck, if a woman my age can't point out the dicks, what good is being a senior citizen?
898011364660137989 2017-08-16 02:39:28 UTC <sally_dehner> So Cville is run by "Jewish communists & criminal niggers." I guess this is how the nice white supremacists talk. Crocodile tears.https://twitter.com/ozaed/status/898008181187719168
898009438711300096 2017-08-16 02:31:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei They also managed to out drump as well.
897931612649799680 2017-08-16 21:22:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @thedailybeast @SafetyPinDaily Came to the conclusion that the Daily Stormer is Hell's version of the Onion. (Apologies to the Onion, which I find really funny.)
897926571327184897 2017-08-16 21:02:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @hondanhon What a diverse group of "protesters".
897914367185870848 2017-08-16 20:14:02 UTC <sally_dehner> The filth of these people is unbelievable. Just remember, our prez said some of them are nice people. Sad. Hold drump accountable.https://twitter.com/SafetyPinDaily/status/897907482994933760
897909583250939906 2017-08-16 19:55:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @kylegriffin1 So Bannon knows where the bodies are buried.
897908816238583810 2017-08-16 19:51:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing If Pence is backing 45* then he isn't the Christian he professes to be. Stand for white supremacists or stand for Christ; you can't do both.
897903606048976896 2017-08-16 19:31:16 UTC <sally_dehner> That's funny. The counter-protesters are happy to have their names & pictures linked with an act of courage. White supremacist=shameful.https://twitter.com/SafetyPinDaily/status/897899275845226496
897900118719946752 2017-08-16 19:17:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @timkaine @PDreams4ever Pence is out of the country. Too dangerous for drump; pushback against him after his horrid comments might have resulted in more protests.
897896811662323712 2017-08-16 19:04:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @VickiLynn47 2\2 Clinton Foundation has helped children all over the world; healthcare initiative has saved thousands. Trump Foundation has helped-drump.
897896017626095617 2017-08-16 19:01:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @VickiLynn47 1\2 Let's compare the Clinton Foundation to the Trump Foundation. They are perfect mirrors of their namesakes.
897894958241382400 2017-08-16 18:56:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @VickiLynn47 I prefer Obama, who lived his faith, to someone like drump who pays it lip service & then lives his life in the most unChristian way.
897840609934888960 2017-08-16 15:20:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @policyte @jonrog1 A win! Vicious but a win none the less.
897838813950750721 2017-08-16 15:13:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @RosieGray @SafetyPinDaily To Mr. 45*, when white supremacists are proud of you, you know your moral train has completely derailed.

897836450548518916 2017-08-16 15:04:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @splinter_news @SafetyPinDaily Before this they thought he just didn't like some black people, women were his to grope & actually he knew one nice Jew & offered him a job.
897835061709549568 2017-08-16 14:58:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @TheRaDR @poetic_anger Check out Nadia Bolz-Weber. You may find some similarities. I love what she has to say.
897795620668309504 2017-08-16 12:22:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @Defend_Reality @VickiLynn47 Anyone who supports drump should not talk about the fruits of the spirit as most of his are linked to greed and apparently white supremacy.
897684157484150785 2017-08-15 04:59:15 UTC <sally_dehner> I am retweeting, asking you to read this, not to expose you to filth but because you need to know how hateful & horrible these people are.https://twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/897675995838328832

897549681839951872 2017-08-15 20:04:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis Wonder why evil racists don't spend time criticizing 45*? Oh wait, I know!

897494991030898692 2017-08-15 16:27:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk Guess drump thought the white supremacists needed his protection. Did Bannon whisper that in his ear?
897494107114831872 2017-08-15 16:24:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @AOL @SafetyPinDaily Hoping that Cville crossed a line & woke an opposition that will take down this latest hate uprising. Shame we have to do it again & again.

897226315740450817 2017-08-14 22:39:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Well at least he's honest. The alt-right thugs came armed with guns & clubs & hate. The counter-protesters were armed with ...truth & love.

897222742109548544 2017-08-14 22:25:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Sorry to hijack. "Do you hear the Nazis sing, singing the song of hateful men. It's the music of a people that want to enslave again."

897219645291319301 2017-08-14 22:13:27 UTC <sally_dehner> Wow! Just wow. She gave me chills. Take that, you hateful Nazi wannabes.https://twitter.com/TimFullerton/status/896886752794865664
897195764866326528 2017-08-14 20:38:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @splinter_news @SafetyPinDaily I picture something like Linda Blair in "The Exorcist."
897194739593773056 2017-08-14 20:34:29 UTC <sally_dehner> The Washington Times shows up on my feed. Their slogan "news you won't find anywhere else." Correct! Fake news you only read on their site.

897141037768077312 2017-08-14 17:01:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing He says he made a stupid comment. There seems to be a lot of stupid in the world today. At least he didn't say it was satire or just joking.

896875617706278917 2017-08-13 23:26:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @yashar @realryancasey @DevonOhara @NicoleOKing I thought it looked like a cross between Bannon and Drump.
896873270556807168 2017-08-13 23:17:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @perlmutations @k2mountainrange Confused. By armed militia are we talking about those military wannabes at the nazi march in Cville? Those were whiny boys playing dress up
896858735196348416 2017-08-13 22:19:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @karyewest @Gman1220 Nazi scum were protesting & rioting because Hillary lost? I had no idea they cared. Does drump know about this, did Bannon lose control?

896855905316339712 2017-08-13 22:08:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark I will be in Yellowstone Sept 14/15. I can hardly wait; haven't visited in a long time. First time visit was July 1970 on my honeymoon.
896852722376429569 2017-08-13 21:55:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark Get a load of the weaponry on those military wannabes called Unite the Right. "But those leftists had rude signs & called us mean names."
896817539438784513 2017-08-13 19:35:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis Correction: Together we are tearing this nation apart & making white racists feel empowered. Lying & cheating is the order of the day. #Yam
896815737070919682 2017-08-13 19:28:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Sessions should never have become AG. His past convicts him, he lied during his hearing & now we expect him to fairly prosecute his friends.

896580280017924096 2017-08-12 03:52:51 UTC <sally_dehner> Fantastic idea!  I immediately went online & gave to some worthy local groups: Pride, NAACP, NOW & Meals on Wheels. Lots more to pick from. https://twitter.com/SaraJBenincasa/status/896260558214897664
896578146903785472 2017-08-12 03:44:22 UTC <sally_dehner> Clear-eyed and unflinching analysis of the Yam.  Too bad more people didn't listen.  Look what we ended up with-stupid is as stupid does.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/896492016854605825

896187621487108097 2017-08-11 01:52:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk I know this issue is not a laughing matter but seeing the words Trump & abstinence in the same sentence is amusing in a horrifying way.
896184553529892866 2017-08-11 01:40:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @Acosta @rendale @markbuc47 "Don't agree with his politics"? That's the least of our problems.  The man is in over his head, lying, floundering. Not foolish-dangerous.
896182715401338880 2017-08-11 01:33:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @deaconseps @goldengateblond Nostradamus Drump strikes again.  So eery how he clearly predicted disaster for the US.
896180611144192000 2017-08-11 01:24:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @intelligencer @SafetyPinDaily Are House Conservatives completely deaf? Is it a pre-existing condition?  I don't know how much louder we have to get before they hear NO.

895104261046063107 2017-08-08 02:07:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @perlmutations Drump's passion for projection is just tremendous. Every one of those words describes him perfectly.

893149050857549824 2017-08-03 16:38:22 UTC <sally_dehner> 2/ Gowdy spent $3,500,000 & 13 months on Benghazi.  18 member staff-$128,750 a year each.  I vote they get no more money for useless work.

892542888810336256 2017-08-01 00:29:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis With the chaos in the WH maybe it got lost in the building or did scaramouche accidentally take it with him?
892485616491008002 2017-08-01 20:42:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @zackbeauchamp @SafetyPinDaily Thank God we didn't elect that warmongerer, Hillary.  Instead we have the peace loving, great negotiator aka President of Pocket Lining.
892402914412679172 2017-08-01 15:13:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @RogueNASA @julesinlr @CeilliBlack So scaramouche resigned before he started, right?
892402546433765378 2017-08-01 15:12:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @RogueNASA Not a statement written by drump for sure. Whole sentences and no back patting means it's written by someone else.

891714999470747649 2017-07-30 17:39:57 UTC <sally_dehner> Right about one thing-the world is watching. Stupid is as stupid does. 45* missed the lesson the other day. Read my lips "No Repeal."

891474687070523392 2017-07-29 01:45:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Had to read the story to see if they can't keep them zipped or the junk food junkie draws the critters in or it's just the undrained swamp.

891386231686385664 2017-07-29 19:53:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @thehill I said last night that the ACA will not implode; Yam will kill it.  Voila-I am omniscient.

890816280789344256 2017-07-27 06:08:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @mitchellvii @elainemhill1 @jkppcp I'm sure it will be better when 45* gets that infrastructure thing going. After the roads/bridges are privatized see if you still complain:)
890814468845740032 2017-07-27 06:01:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @mitchellvii @elainemhill1 @jkppcp Been to CA many times. Taxes are what you pay to be part of America. You could try one of the red states, I hear they use a lot of our taxes
890812875979149313 2017-07-27 05:55:14 UTC <sally_dehner> It's understandable that swamp people would get hives when asked to do anything ethical.https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/890567161076482048
890811681529413632 2017-07-27 05:50:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @mitchellvii @elainemhill1 @jkppcp Jacci: "Have to deal with a lot of liberal politics in CA" Me: Good.
890810607598948352 2017-07-27 05:46:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @mitchellvii @adam7926 Better to have Obamacare than to be forced to have trumpnocare also known as the Republican Death Star.
890807887110352896 2017-07-27 05:35:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @jonfavs Well if Blunt is involved integrity probably walked out the door.
890626448955920384 2017-07-27 17:34:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @MerriamWebster @joecoscarelli Should have Xeroxed that letter and passed it around the office.
890611368256303105 2017-07-27 16:34:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alt_DeptofED @goldengateblond Voucher deVos can use it to take her buddies to lunch.
890611065054154752 2017-07-27 16:33:19 UTC <sally_dehner> The drump pledge: on my honor I will try to be hateful, rude, stupid, hypocritical, racist, misogynistic, clueless & vengeful. Swamp badge!https://twitter.com/zesty_leftwing/status/890605535841599491
890609037997465602 2017-07-27 16:25:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark Andy & his satire-gotta love it. However, Girl Scouts are meeting in Oct, hope there is no standing presidential invite. Restraining order!
890603491999322112 2017-07-27 16:03:13 UTC <sally_dehner> The toddlers are running the school! Wait, I take that back, actually toddlers are smarter than most GOP senators.https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/890597270361649153
890379908618309634 2017-07-26 01:14:47 UTC <sally_dehner> Mazie Hirono was the real hero in the Senate.https://twitter.com/charlesjaco1/status/890364912278671361
890379052615421954 2017-07-26 01:11:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @atrupar @SafetyPinDaily This American woman says Senate proponents of drumpcare should be beaten-right now with a stick and at the polls in the future.
890233648712167424 2017-07-26 15:33:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @McJesse @creolepepper @CloseEnough22 @ddeenniissee59 And I discovered they sell them on Amazon with free shipping! Who knew??
890218645053485056 2017-07-26 14:33:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @lisamurkowski @BadHombreNPS @AltUSFWS Some will emerge with honor, some in disgrace-an apt description of our country right now.  45* & the Senate are on the "wrong" side. Sad.
890217600181047297 2017-07-26 14:29:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @lisamurkowski @AltUSFWS Patriotic Senators would have voted to end this stupidity, back off & write a bill to help ALL citizens. Look at votes, see the patriots?
889933601487429632 2017-07-25 19:41:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @ShallTakeCare @dylanlscott So they voted, with help from Ayatollah Pence, to debate the mystery bill.
889933206589493249 2017-07-25 19:39:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @intelligencer @SafetyPinDaily Cowards with a lot to hide.
889928616930402304 2017-07-25 19:21:31 UTC <sally_dehner> Because drump projects-maybe it was Take Your Brother to Work Day & that's what Junior did.https://twitter.com/zackford/status/889812096816480256
889907757272506368 2017-07-25 17:58:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @atrupar @SafetyPinDaily Repugnant? People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
889907537742581761 2017-07-25 17:57:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Well, she told no lies. And the other senator is right-she could take him on. I see him as an overgrown piata.
889906555281387520 2017-07-25 17:53:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @Independent @SafetyPinDaily And we all want to fire DT.
889906248489082882 2017-07-25 17:52:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @CNNPolitics @SafetyPinDaily @gardeningishard I wonder about his billionaire claims myself. What are those tax returns hiding? Methinks he doth protest too much.
889904335789981697 2017-07-25 17:45:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers Would it be okay if they leak something and then erase it? Transparency right?
889904039525326849 2017-07-25 17:43:51 UTC <sally_dehner> Not every woman is a role model. Sarah Palin-no. Ivanka-nyet. Kellyanne-gosh no. Ann Wagner-a whoops. Remember Phyllis Schlafly? Big no.https://twitter.com/reverantrevan/status/889799574528851969
889883524827893760 2017-07-25 16:22:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @ALT_uscis Would everyone in this administration who DOESN'T have ties with Russia please raise their hand. Waiting, waiting-that's what I thought.
889857527848022018 2017-07-25 14:39:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump Putin and I will guard negative things and Russian hacking. Thank you drump for spelling out your wicked plans.
889854135184523264 2017-07-25 14:25:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @jenelr @RWPUSA Wait, did Junior drag his little brother to that meeting? Lots of people there, maybe the baby too? Since 45* projects, makes me wonder.
889835549103730688 2017-07-25 13:11:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @CarlySitrin @SafetyPinDaily And she might say yes to a duel if he were a man.
889834302346846208 2017-07-25 13:06:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @atrupar @SafetyPinDaily Transparency by coverup; this man is just perfect to serve the present administration.
889831636828901376 2017-07-25 12:56:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis @mariah_june Must be tired this morning, took me a minute to get it. Once I did, my laughter woke the dog. Good one!
889830540064550913 2017-07-25 12:51:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @shaz1er @ALT_uscis Plan of 45* & posse; tsunami of corruption/disaster. Where to look first-Russia, healthcare, education etc. 180 days? Feels like years.
889828067425890305 2017-07-25 12:41:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @sjmorris31 @TedGenoways @MarthaWolkonsky Drump ruined & politicized the visit to the Jamboree, no one else. Your husband thought it was great? That speaks for itself. Yuck.
889466125263802368 2017-07-24 12:43:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @Amy_Siskind @LaurenDownSouth If he doesn't understand what he's doing, he needs to go. If he understands what he's doing he really need to go. Tillerson=Traitor?
889344278190858242 2017-07-23 04:39:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @Scaramucci @shaz1er @4everNeverTrump Perhaps Moochi & Kellyanne CONway will spend time reminiscing about what they used to say about drump. 180 degree turnaround kind of amusing
889335336756813825 2017-07-23 04:04:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Wow, 45* really is creating jobs for America! We just didn't realize they would all be law positions to defend his family.pic.twitter.com/dYkSHxWJsz
889307758088028160 2017-07-23 02:14:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump @BettyBowers Betty nails it again!
889227087810351104 2017-07-23 20:53:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 So not really testifying, just having a friendly little chat. Such hypocrisy. If one of us did 1/10th what these dodos did, we'd be in jail.
888999979125276673 2017-07-22 05:51:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @DavidHaroldFin2 @SaysHummingbird @orangecakemix Not hatred that's getting out of hand but the president and this administration.
888754341343105027 2017-07-22 13:35:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @ananavarro Wouldn't need to be such good liars if the 45* posse told the truth once in awhile.
888228798801510401 2017-07-20 02:47:02 UTC <sally_dehner> When a president has a hissy fit over the idea of revealing his tax returns, wise citizens begin to wonder just what he's hiding. Hmmmm.https://twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/888209005537095680
888211131675881472 2017-07-20 01:36:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 Saw Nugent was performing & wondered first if he knew where Hillsboro was & second how JeffCo residents could possibly want to see this pos.
888047404964093953 2017-07-20 14:46:15 UTC <sally_dehner> I proudly claim the word. https://twitter.com/jamespmorrison/status/881198598096072705
887484488439271425 2017-07-18 01:29:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @kelleAbond @TrickOrTreackle Sure 45*, sabotage the ACA no matter how many citizens will be hurt then have a few repub men get together & write another crappy plan.
887427014805868544 2017-07-18 21:41:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @danmericaCNN @2000Lamb Thank you for the laugh. Humor is the best prescription for these trying times.
887180111438635008 2017-07-17 05:19:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @danmericaCNN @2000Lamb Second childhood for drump. What's next-playing doctor?
887177561024995328 2017-07-17 05:09:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @RogueNASA #AltGov is the reason I joined Twitter.  I saw all the rogue accounts standing up for America & I just had to follow.  You give me hope.
886932039085281280 2017-07-17 12:54:11 UTC <sally_dehner> Give me the right side. I prefer real news over the fake cap. We WERE great but now, not so much. Cap made overseas, imported by Russia?https://twitter.com/Tombx7M/status/886884962292641796
885350719330627588 2017-07-12 04:10:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers DTJr. had a delusion his Russia meeting would be a secret, but it was an illusion. The conclusion? It was collusion.
885348497423249408 2017-07-12 04:01:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @_thepapajohn Ms. Obvious here.  They don't have stars because they were presidents but because they were performers.  Liberals find this amusing.
885216888728547328 2017-07-12 19:18:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @JuddLegum Why didn't they just pin it on Frederick Douglass? Just as credible.

885194709014130695 2017-07-12 17:50:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @PrisonPlanet @pidajosey @Vickiegogreen Dang, I thought it was the orange koolaid that was the alt right issue. You've explained it-it's methane gas fogging up your drump bubble :)
884997138018693120 2017-07-11 04:45:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @greatagain4 @Ian_D23 If you had said your vocabulary was bigly and you knew all the best words I would have sworn you were drump in disguise.

I don't see a silver spoon.  Is it where the sun doesn't shine? That would explain the facial expression.
884907600214622209 2017-07-11 22:49:47 UTC <sally_dehner> When are journalists going to stop this travesty. Briefings are fake news from DT. Skip it & go do some in-depth investigation  elsewhere.https://twitter.com/nbcnightlynews/status/884845028996071425
884906354699374592 2017-07-11 22:44:50 UTC <sally_dehner> This from a person who thinks he's making America great again?!? Job evaluation: DT lacks common sense & ability to read people.https://twitter.com/nbcnightlynews/status/884842437570699264
884905427913367552 2017-07-11 22:41:09 UTC <sally_dehner> Stating Sessions treated all Americans equally under the law (Shelby-R-AL) was a laughable offense. No prison time for common sense please.https://twitter.com/safetypindaily/status/884902710566420480
884902714487996416 2017-07-11 22:30:22 UTC <sally_dehner> Red flag going up; Pence knows handwriting on the wall. BUT I believe he knew what was going on. He needs to go down with the rest of them.https://twitter.com/safetypindaily/status/884899037064908801
884900704485330944 2017-07-11 22:22:23 UTC <sally_dehner> This is the pattern: no collusion; well maybe collusion but no big deal;  wait, Hillary did it first; and finally: I've hired a mob lawyer.https://twitter.com/safetypindaily/status/884899425327493120
884899802655469568 2017-07-11 22:18:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @PrisonPlanet @pidajosey @Vickiegogreen I despise hypocrites;which is why I hate 45* & his entire family. Not too impressed with responses here. You people live in a bubble.
884551983981633539 2017-07-10 23:16:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @ZoeTillman @SafetyPinDaily DTJr made a good choice; who better to defend an organized crime family member than a lawyer with experience.  Cybercrime is an added bonus.
884242971566252032 2017-07-09 02:48:47 UTC <sally_dehner> @kelleAbond @mattyglesias Collusion, obviously but Junior gets paid to tell about his entrepreneurial exp & career advice?? Proves there's a sucker born every minute.
884198799152906240 2017-07-09 23:53:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @Newsweek @SafetyPinDaily Both and as such confederate statues should be in museums where the heritage of hate can be explained.

884196570828349440 2017-07-09 23:44:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @DonaldJTrumpJr @MSNBC @NBCNews @BobbyHome @libedon Read Magnitsky Act & don't understand the relation to Russian adoptions??
884193982208765953 2017-07-09 23:34:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @NBCNews If she said Russia was funding the DNC that probably didn't make sense since you knew the shoe was on the other foot.
883853288650792961 2017-07-08 01:00:19 UTC <sally_dehner> Grand Canyon staff did not recognize the "quality & integrity" of your research but were forced by 45* to allow you to desecrate the park.https://twitter.com/SafetyPinDaily/status/883844408956907525

883773982394249216 2017-07-08 19:45:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @BettyBowers Is the whole family on this trip? Can't drump travel without his kids and the in-laws?

883045082940620800 2017-07-06 19:28:48 UTC <sally_dehner> Good job Blunt, this makes you look rude & uncaring. Why not listen to constituents & stand up for them? Oh, you only listen to lobbyists?https://twitter.com/charlesjaco1/status/883039257400573952
883034096070516736 2017-07-06 18:45:09 UTC <sally_dehner> All reporting about Maine's governor should have a warning label: this what the governor said but since he lies a lot we cannot verify it.https://twitter.com/maddow/status/883031608831475713
883030570317619202 2017-07-06 18:31:08 UTC <sally_dehner> Read about the many times drump has done this sort of thing. He may be the least charitable person ever. Rude & self-centered, not generous.https://twitter.com/petersagal/status/879896208273285126
882733041730433024 2017-07-05 22:48:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @yountzee_ Do you follow Randy Rainbow? Love that man.
882244564270043136 2017-07-04 14:27:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @HamillHimself @TheDotP @xfgarciax No one will ever call drump a hero (except maybe drump in one of his stupid tweets).
882244046810435585 2017-07-04 14:25:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @HamillHimself Probably a reaction to the low standard set by current "modern" president.
882235637180628993 2017-07-04 13:52:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @MattAsherS @lovetogive2 Worse, Fox is entertainment, not news. Impeachment, 25th Amendment, Resistance-these are now entertainment in the "modern" presidency.
882233547209269248 2017-07-04 13:44:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @Independent @SafetyPinDaily Obvious response-America cuts off heat to WH. Drump & his posse are so full of hot air they may not notice. This will save money.
882004513145716736 2017-07-03 22:33:57 UTC <sally_dehner> Oh this is good. No, better than good-it's what drump deserves.https://twitter.com/lawyerrogelio/status/881967251406151680
881993862235000832 2017-07-03 21:51:38 UTC <sally_dehner> I would be happier applying the #25thAmendment if it didn't mean a President Pence. From the frying pan into the fire?
881943338630483968 2017-07-03 18:30:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @ananavarro @PamVictor @intactive @mimimayes13 Well you convict yourself. Just like 45* convicts himself in every tweet and speech. 2020? Prison or exile, either one is fine.
881882504680132608 2017-07-03 14:29:08 UTC <sally_dehner> Words not to be uttered by tRump, WH, & tRump family: ethics, integrity, honesty, empathy, compassion, charity.
881879695737974789 2017-07-03 14:17:58 UTC <sally_dehner> Alexander Hamilton never met tRump but he sure has him down pat. Scary, isn't it?https://twitter.com/3L3V3NTH/status/881855493278511104
881603394636582915 2017-07-02 20:00:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @nickpwing @SafetyPinDaily So the crimes of this administration are due to lack of morality? She said it. Can't blame their crimes on poverty or lack of jobs, right?
881601880736108546 2017-07-02 19:54:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @nickpwing @SafetyPinDaily If Jeff Sessions is worried about levels of violence perhaps he needs to sit down with one of the main proponents i.e. the NRA.
881599916694482945 2017-07-02 19:46:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @mdcontrera If tRump is so wealthy he really shouldn't mind toeing the line legally & separating himself from his business. It's only for 4 yrs or less.
881589150306246656 2017-07-02 19:03:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @mdcontrera Just want people treated fairly. Read his history. No surprise he's a sleazy prez. He's a sleazy man. Crazy, maybe, crazy successful? Hummm.
881574813046910977 2017-07-02 18:06:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @mdcontrera Stains. Only in the minds of Trey Gowdy & the crew that have spent years trying to ruin her. Looking for dirt? The WH needs a lot of Tide.
881572031686467584 2017-07-02 17:55:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @mdcontrera Earned it? That's funny. Money from daddy. Multiple bankruptcies. Stiffing loads of people like hotel contractors and trump u consumers. Etc
881570085403545600 2017-07-02 17:47:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei Dear drump, anybody would be doing a better job as president than you.  I could do it better, although history is not my strength either.

880951586402557952 2017-06-30 00:50:00 UTC <sally_dehner> Greitens is apparently a Koch boyfriend. Choose Mr. Governor-it's either us or them and it looks like you are choosing them. Never forget.https://twitter.com/ssnich/status/878736094128480256
880950710619299840 2017-06-30 00:46:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @MOGirlsState @nicolergalloway If Greitens thinks these women are our future he ought to rethink some of his agenda. Doesn't impress me as thinking about anyone in MO.
880949452810440704 2017-06-30 00:41:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @tonymess @charlesjaco1 I heard the number of states resisting is up to 24. MO? Already sent the info. Gotta love Greitens and Ashcroft, always putting us 1st. NOT.
880948653489369088 2017-06-30 00:38:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @maddow No science and technology; what a perfect metaphor for this administration.
880944888052944896 2017-06-30 00:23:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @tonymess @charlesjaco1 Apparently Ashcroft and Greitens immediately rolled over and sent the requested info. Just once could they stand up for their citizens?
880942478555303936 2017-06-30 00:13:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @SafetyPinDaily If they think the left is radical perhaps they'd better watch out. The 2nd Amendment will protect us from tyranny. Fist of truth will smite.
880876662266748929 2017-06-30 19:52:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @EricGreitens I see that you are being asked to turn over voting records including SS numbers to a ? commission. Permission denied here.
880862259169374210 2017-06-30 18:55:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 Can we expect MO to join them or would that be too hard for our drump loving governor?
880841775874789377 2017-06-30 17:33:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @travelinlady99 @David4justice48 Blackmail is bad but isn't being smeared by the Enquirer a badge of honor, sort of like being blocked by drump on Twitter?
880841312995610625 2017-06-30 17:31:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @JenAshleyWright These are the sorts of people the NRA fears. That is probably because smart people are the hope of America & the NRA will be it's death.

880839154300485632 2017-06-30 17:23:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @DavidCornDC Not sure we have the time and the manpower for all the investigations needed against this flawed and criminal administration.

880777769130618881 2017-06-30 13:19:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @EricHolder @csin1957 @KimnanaT You just validated Mr. Holder's comment. Way to go.

880664512499724289 2017-06-29 05:49:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @chellenelson17 @DavidJollyFL Random thoughts. Looked for my name-just kidding. Did anyone else notice every comment under Hillary Clinton described drump?
880626755442180097 2017-06-29 03:19:14 UTC <sally_dehner> And America is no longer America, the land of the free. The Statue of Liberty weeps (and has a strong desire to smack your heads together.)https://twitter.com/chachachewee/status/880554830543978496
880626234442559492 2017-06-29 03:17:10 UTC <sally_dehner> When the names O'Reilly, Huckabee and drump are ib the same sentence lauding a bill you just know it's a bad one.https://twitter.com/billoreilly/status/880201707514454017
880625196486594566 2017-06-29 03:13:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @maxbergmann @politico BTW, ask Trey Gowdy how pointing the finger at Hillary Clinton worked for y'all. & ask him what it cost us for him to look so stupid.

880567799407669249 2017-06-29 23:24:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @RoyBlunt @policyte According to other Republican comments, is it possible blunt did not live a healthy lifestyle; perhaps not entitled to this level of care.

880181095865700352 2017-06-28 21:48:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @RBReich Why don't the congressional members just ask their big donors for the money. What's another $2500 from the fat cats.

880164325817810944 2017-06-28 20:41:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @cordenthusiast You mentioned the big picture. In this WH that's the only big picture anyone is fond of.
880163740351684608 2017-06-28 20:39:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @TimAlberta My manners have suffered since January. "Forget about the little shit" made me think-there's one little shit I'd like to forget about-drump.
880163241502154752 2017-06-28 20:37:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @TimAlberta @cordenthusiast Which big picture wa that? The painting where all the billionaires gather around the table and toast their latest tax cut?

880054340760862721 2017-06-28 13:24:40 UTC <sally_dehner> No surprise. Whole point of this administration was to allow corporate access to override regulations they don't want.https://twitter.com/ap/status/879827291248971777
880053285390077952 2017-06-28 13:20:28 UTC <sally_dehner> Healthcare is not a war or an election.  Real president would not tout victory but do what's right for American citizens.
879936591661342720 2017-06-27 05:36:46 UTC <sally_dehner> Way to go Al Franken. No one in this administration quite knows what to do when faced with facts.https://twitter.com/therickydavila/status/879770645797588992

879788729153486850 2017-06-27 19:49:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @clairecmc we trust you to speak up for REAL healthcare for all citizens. The senate "no healthcare" bill is a disaster. Just say no.
879787595823284225 2017-06-27 19:44:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @RoyBlunt step up to the plate & defend your constituents from the proposed "no care" bill. MO seniors, children & the disabled count on you
879744282361561088 2017-06-27 16:52:36 UTC <sally_dehner> I have always blamed Reagan for the ruination of the middle class. For that reason he ranks in my top 5 worst presidents. Congrats #1-drump. https://twitter.com/puppymnkey/status/879736427822632960

878228679624503296 2017-06-23 12:30:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @allahpundit @maynard_clayton @brooks112003 How stupid. Government funds don't pay for abortions & Planned Parenthood provides many other services. Your lack of vision gave us drump.

878225844803522560 2017-06-23 12:18:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @SusanMTJones @ShawnCrippen @DinghusKahn @585Conservative @DomZenga Poor people don't want to work 3 jobs & pay taxes so people like you can be rude & insulting while sitting on your duff tweeting.
878225285434494976 2017-06-23 12:16:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @SusanMTJones @ShawnCrippen @DinghusKahn @585Conservative @DomZenga You believe a falsehood. Republican land of demonic unemployed people out to steal your money doesn't exist.
878223702537777152 2017-06-23 12:10:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @DomZenga @SusanMTJones @ShawnCrippen @DinghusKahn @585Conservative ACA provided insurance & saved lives. AHCA & Senate disaster plan-actual death panels in action. Hope phone systems in DC melt down today.
878222363086774272 2017-06-23 12:05:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @DomZenga @SusanMTJones @ShawnCrippen @DinghusKahn @585Conservative Good point-that is why AHCA & Senate disaster update are bad, bad, bad.
878115742280933376 2017-06-22 05:01:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @travelinlady99 @Amy_Siskind HE didn't make tapes, HE doesn't have tapes. What about others? Suspicious mind here.
878071265038262272 2017-06-22 02:04:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @DomZenga @SusanMTJones @1kathyr @585Conservative You aren't really suggesting McConnell & Repubs are patriots are you?? Don't make me gag.

878069174181871616 2017-06-22 01:56:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @BetsyDeVosED @Alt_DeptofED Another example of drump administration philosophy-appoint fox to guard henhouse.
878068252261339136 2017-06-22 01:52:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @DomZenga @SusanMTJones @ShawnCrippen @DinghusKahn @585Conservative These people WILL lose healthcare because they won't be able to afford it. What part of that don't you & McConnell understand?
878067242117804035 2017-06-22 01:48:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @DomZenga @SusanMTJones @1kathyr @585Conservative Well mr 585 conservative, we know who the patriots were today & who are to be admired. The opposite of patriot? McConnell & the rats.
878065057115942912 2017-06-22 01:39:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 I imagine Comey hoped there were tapes. Considering drump in public his private conversations must be lulus. Tapes confiscated by staff?
877553889486266378 2017-06-21 15:48:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @jdice03 Also called sad outcome for GA. When are people going to wake up & smell the coffee? You vote Repub you're  shooting yourself in the foot.
877401060364759041 2017-06-20 05:41:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis #kellyannecongoingaway people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones or rude comments.
877354349701222400 2017-06-20 02:35:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 If Repubs continue to cheat we will have no hope in 2018. It's hard to fight dark money and voter suppression.
877295463002779650 2017-06-20 22:41:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk Did everybody understand that when drump promised more jobs he meant jobs for lawyers representing his corrupt administration?
877292320558911489 2017-06-20 22:29:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag Love the phrase "to my knowledge." It's Pence's favorite expression too. Then when the shit hits the fan they can say "I had no idea."
877012825641758720 2017-06-19 03:58:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @thehill Caption for the picture: tRump says "Stupid isn't she? But not as dumb as I am."
877012198979231744 2017-06-19 03:56:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @andylassner @SharonWillow54 You had to rub it in. We are jealous.
877011373460467712 2017-06-19 03:53:00 UTC <sally_dehner> Yes, yes, yes. This man gets it. And I get Roy Blunt. Sigh.https://twitter.com/mattmfm/status/876992791838150656
877009492520693760 2017-06-19 03:45:31 UTC <sally_dehner> This ticks me off.https://twitter.com/mattmfm/status/876997685852737541

876795223845818368 2017-06-19 13:34:06 UTC <sally_dehner> And the next line "White folks spitting in our faces, and we'd reward 'em with the vote." Sounds like Repubs November 2016. Stay strong GA.https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/876575585975324672
876792185181569024 2017-06-19 13:22:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei And it was the van that drove into them, clean-shaven white man just happened to be in van. Nothing to see here, move along.
876790865011908608 2017-06-19 13:16:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @TimAlberta @POLITICOMag Pence as leader; that's scary. Either totally blind or totally complicit; which is it? Frightening either way.
876506650894532608 2017-06-18 18:27:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @imchip Clown sightings were a preview of the drump reality show. Wonder who the actors were-Spicer, Bannon, Pence, Sessions, Jared, sons of drump?
876505208695783426 2017-06-18 18:21:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @ManAtArms4Ever Supposedly drump is prez. Not seeing much action on that front. Hard to be presidential while raving on Twitter and sweating corruption.

876409505529167872 2017-06-18 12:01:23 UTC <sally_dehner> Read the whole speech from March 9, 2010. Be impressed & then compare it to any 45* speech. Ouch.https://twitter.com/Jayne4Susan/status/876352381537144832

876405620634767360 2017-06-18 11:45:57 UTC <sally_dehner> Why regulations? Because somebody cheated. Clean air, clean water, construction, car manufacturing regulations. All there to stop cheaters.https://twitter.com/SafetyPinDaily/status/876390472763224064
876288426777161728 2017-06-17 04:00:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @aparnapkin @Lydiaisfire That spokesperson better shut up. Sounds to me like he's saying his client is ready to go back to assaulting women. Not a bright statement.

874721159811616768 2017-06-13 20:12:30 UTC <sally_dehner> Right on, Ms. Harris.  This hiding of the GOP plan details smells to high heavens.https://twitter.com/SenKamalaHarris/status/874334532387958784
874685195487727616 2017-06-13 17:49:36 UTC <sally_dehner> Guess it depends on your definition of stupid.  Mine includes most of the Republican members of Congress; throwing healthcare under the bus.https://twitter.com/crookedmedia/status/874669614034071553

873169661927534593 2017-06-09 13:27:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @ntmessage The phrase "talented trump people" is absolutely the funniest thing I've read this morning. Comedians everywhere will want to steal it.

870654583063838720 2017-06-02 14:53:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @voxdotcom @SafetyPinDaily @blondie54 The Blunt One is always front & center when big donors need "protecting". That's why he never speaks to constituents; afraid to face them.
870535714852810752 2017-06-02 07:01:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @TheRickWilson Anyone with a brain would say I'm being investigated for Russian collusion, this is not a good idea. Anyone with a brain; I rest my case.
870531342991147009 2017-06-01 06:43:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @yashar @malski1954 @stefa522 @Ginny_ficaddict @Chris3565Chris @IanMCohen You can't even find a mind in this administration so there is none to waste.
870530988060794880 2017-06-01 06:42:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @shaz1er @yashar 45* is incompetent & this is just one of the many examples. It's always a good idea to consult a Fox floozy before making a big decision.
870528900035629056 2017-06-01 06:33:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @nytimes @SafetyPinDaily I like this word. I told someone to go covfefe themselves and it felt good.
870528310844903425 2017-06-01 06:31:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag Unwittingly does lots of things-created a whole new politically active group of 50-60's women who are out to defeat him.
870491879845928960 2017-06-01 04:06:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @igorbobic @SafetyPinDaily Do republicans have some sort of lock on nutcases? They seem to attract a large percentage.

870454619226484736 2017-06-01 01:38:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @Independent @SafetyPinDaily Waiting with bated breath for 45* tweet about how upset Barron & his grown children are about this awful statement of hate-waiting, waiting,
870398808324177925 2017-06-01 21:57:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @ProgWIS "Kathy Griffin was obviously using a staged photo to show how much anger people have toward 45*." That's the word according to drump.

870105585647325186 2017-05-31 02:31:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 Apparently your hero can grab 'em but you can't accept our disdain. Snowflake melting/Avalanche coming down.
870105089473732610 2017-05-31 02:29:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 I wouldn't want to be drump, Ryan, McConnell or anyone from this administration standing before the judgement seat.
870104809306816512 2017-05-31 02:28:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 I think God will be a lot more understanding about abortion than He will ever be about the horrors this administration is dealing.

870103319200620544 2017-05-31 02:22:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 @CreacyPaula And real dialogue is a non-existent commodity among drump supporters. Too busy swallowing 45* lies, you think?
870102842958372864 2017-05-31 02:20:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 @CreacyPaula Yep, I would wear the hat proudly because it's a reminder of what drek got put in the WH. Feminists fight not just for women but everyone.
870101772131553281 2017-05-31 02:16:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 @mommags2579 Sorry, you are totally wrong & you malign a good woman. Power & greed define drump not Hillary Clinton. He lies; take off the blindfold!
870071137920790528 2017-05-31 00:14:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 @CreacyPaula Also the letter warrior, the phone call warrior and the march warrior. Who knew 45* would inspire an army of REAL patriots 
870070304088961025 2017-05-31 00:11:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 @CreacyPaula Keyboard warrior is an honorable title just like snowflake. Of course we are not alt right snowflakes who  can't take heat. Avalanche here.
870069379177861120 2017-05-31 00:07:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 @CreacyPaula Fierce and ready to spread truth. Sorry you can't handle it.
870062547302481920 2017-05-31 23:40:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 Not supporting us. Husband has union pension after 40 years of work; collect SS he & I paid into. Never mind taxes going to help others tho.
870061219348172800 2017-05-31 23:35:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 Wrong! Being prez is trump brand marketing tool. Whole family disgusts me.
870060613044756481 2017-05-31 23:33:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 I don't "back" abortionists. I am pro-choice. Believe that pregnancy is a unique relationship between woman & fetus. Her choice not yours.
869988487658733568 2017-05-31 18:46:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 Lies and brain damage. Are you projecting like drump does? Like for every Twitter he wrote in the past there is an equal & opposite one now?
869963156113588224 2017-05-31 17:05:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @dreambig0319 I have to agree. Griffin's picture while horrible & rude doesn't quite compare with 8 years of Obama bashing.

869911838124847104 2017-05-31 13:41:59 UTC <sally_dehner> This is my license to be snarky about 45*. The right can say this about Mr. Obama. 8 years of THIS & whines about 100+ days of 45* truth. https://twitter.com/thepatriot1973/status/869843398894780417
869908097481019392 2017-05-31 13:27:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 Wanted intelligent woman with love of country-got greedy lying, racist, old man wanting to line his pockets at our expense. Bad trade.
869907314358325248 2017-05-31 13:24:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 Glad we can amuse each other. My comments may get thru to you yet. You sling mud, call me stupid but I can see how 45* plays you all. Sad.
869906228633362432 2017-05-31 13:19:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @jwhaifa @ThePatriot1973 Thank you, you prove our point about trumpets. You do not deserve the freedoms you have been given.
869905851347337216 2017-05-31 13:18:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 I'll take that room, add Franken, Fudge, McCaskill & others. Sorry you are stuck with Ryan, McConnell, Chaffetz, Wagner & the newest loser.
869807338345177088 2017-05-30 06:46:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @TomiLahren @Skepacabra @LaColeMiller10 Possibly Repubs don't apologize because they don't know how low they are.
869802167670067202 2017-05-30 06:26:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @LaraLeaTrump @realDonaldTrump @cristal_deaton @GOPPollAnalyst Depends upon your definition of troll. If you are referring 2 me though-no troll-American patriot wanting best for our country-45* not it.
869801262451236864 2017-05-30 06:22:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @LaraLeaTrump @realDonaldTrump @cristal_deaton @GOPPollAnalyst Snarky part of me assumes he doesn't know where the situation room is. Very sad for the people of Kabul. Always the citizens take the brunt.
869799076090576896 2017-05-30 06:13:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 @CreacyPaula Have never paid attention 2 followers. If you read me fine, block me, that's okay, means I got to you. Comments welcome. Snark is free.
869797967078862848 2017-05-30 06:09:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 @CreacyPaula I will accept title of keyboard warrior. Writing is how I express my disgust and dismay over what is happening in our country.
869795249325043712 2017-05-30 05:58:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @jwhaifa Thank you for the gif. I need it for all the trolls on Twitter. I'm hoping you aren't one because I hear responding to them is a bad idea.
869794781676916739 2017-05-30 05:56:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @LaraLeaTrump @realDonaldTrump @GOPPollAnalyst @cristal_deaton Since smart people know #covfefe is a typo then expect Spicer and Kellyanne to amuse us with their explanation. I wonder what it really says
869792667487678464 2017-05-30 05:48:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @FLOOKLYN @blaknek And #covfefe is definitely the best. Even better if we ever unearth the definition.
869784751539924992 2017-05-30 05:16:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @CNNPolitics @SafetyPinDaily I don't think the current Senate understands how the Senate is supposed to work.
869778944521891840 2017-05-30 04:53:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @Cernovich Yes please encourage full prison time for the liar who likes little girls. Although I've heard that sitting presidents can't be prosecuted.
869778019136700416 2017-05-30 04:50:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @Cernovich Was that sext written to drump?
869774261321433088 2017-05-30 04:35:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @eshugerman @SafetyPinDaily No, not a deep state conspiracy. You are victims of your own greed & stupidity. Why don't you just pack up & go away. We'd all be happier.
869759043736391680 2017-05-30 03:34:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @kathygriffin @TheJusticeDept @SecretService @CaptRick13 The snowflakes are turning into an avalanche just like we told you we would. We're not putting up with this crappy administration.
869758405430390784 2017-05-30 03:32:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @kathygriffin @TheJusticeDept @SecretService @CreacyPaula Only if her indictment is paired with tRump impeachment.
869758000969510912 2017-05-30 03:30:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 And you do know that for trump maga stands for make America greedy again. He and his posse are laughing at you.
869757412164734978 2017-05-30 03:28:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 My feelings are not hurt. My mind just boggles over the rudeness and idiocy of trumpets. You are actually pissing on America.
869756873901322244 2017-05-30 03:26:12 UTC <sally_dehner> @jwhaifa The greatest threat to America is not Isis, N. Korea or even  homegrown terrorists. Greatest threat is this current greedy administration.
869753733894348800 2017-05-30 03:13:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 @CreacyPaula We know that 45* has no stamina. He may ride from room to room in the WH in a golf cart-it's a bigly place. Job is too much for the old man.
869752538417037312 2017-05-30 03:08:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 And then there is evidence that while she managed to campaign while suffering from pneumonia, 45* can't even work a whole day without a nap.
869752088384999425 2017-05-30 03:07:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @ArthurvanDamn1 45* owes allegiance to golf cart manufacturers. Without them he'd probably still be moping around abroad shoving people out of the way.
869617202621804544 2017-05-30 18:11:12 UTC <sally_dehner> Yep, two very different statements. A girl stands up against the system and a male pisses on her because he can. https://twitter.com/fdghtp54/status/869567044835987456
869602429008052225 2017-05-30 17:12:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @theKimRossi @RVAwonk @WeHearPodcast Don't forget a chunk of followers are us-resisters who joined to comment on the idiocy. If you subtract us & fake bots=20 actual followers?
869553066558803969 2017-05-30 13:56:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @HillaryClinton @ArthurvanDamn1 She's too old? You do know drump is older (and has less stamina ) than Ms. Clinton.
869534809068105728 2017-05-30 12:43:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @ajplus The true power of African Art or any art is to make you think & question & feel.  Success! Congratulations to Ms. Roberts.
869369414939967489 2017-05-29 01:46:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @USFreedomArmy Sadly France & the rest of our allies will have given up on us & our stupid leader drump.. We will be a 3rd world dictatorship in the future
869052804870131712 2017-05-28 04:48:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump Honey, you wouldn't recognize truth if it stepped up and smacked you alongside the head. Just saying.
868947666343952386 2017-05-28 21:50:42 UTC <sally_dehner> This is the GOP showing symptoms of tRump poisoning.https://twitter.com/georgetakei/status/868884071824404480
868849863991189504 2017-05-28 15:22:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis @TheRickyDavila Does anyone else feel they are losing their grip on good manners and feeling a desire to slap DeVos silly?
868847510852444160 2017-05-28 15:12:43 UTC <sally_dehner> We keep hearing about fake news & lo & behold here is a senator who is part of the fake news team! WTG Corker. https://twitter.com/nashanony/status/868836708623712256
868825572457168897 2017-05-28 13:45:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @dusborne @SafetyPinDaily I think his boorishness stems from not being taught manners as a child & a mistaken belief that he is more important than everybody else.
868795027442593792 2017-05-28 11:44:10 UTC <sally_dehner> Good point.https://twitter.com/lucifergop/status/868667238794113024
868794057954172928 2017-05-28 11:40:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @KarenAttiah @SafetyPinDaily Ms. Obvious here. Drump's behavior everyday, everywhere is embarrassing.
868594221296562176 2017-05-27 22:26:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @jsiterlet Meant to ask you if you noticed in that article that anti-trump people used words until one was jumped by a trumpet. Moral high ground.
868463116602028033 2017-05-27 13:45:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @AlterNet @SafetyPinDaily Sad for her yet not sad. Calling 45* budget "taxpayers first" is the sort of political voodoo that makes us all sick to our stomachs.
868461559349207040 2017-05-27 13:39:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @yountzee_ Hard to respond in 140 but this makes me sad and happy. Go Marissa, buy a notebook & start writing up a five year plan, a ten year plan :)
868459965316517889 2017-05-27 13:32:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag Would this be like State Farm going into the car selling business? But I think every gun owner should be required to carry insurance.
868459212086534144 2017-05-27 13:29:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag You missed the bus on this. There was global alarm b4 his arrival & nothing he said made it better. (Lots of face palming by our allies).
868203684781596673 2017-05-26 20:34:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @anjalikumar @bidupedo If we are stupid enough to vote drump back ink office in 2020 then we will deserve losing our democracy and our sovereign nation.
868203017274888194 2017-05-26 20:31:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU @anjalikumar Is Mike Pence and his words laugh-worthy or cringe-worthy? Men and women of integrity; not found in the current administration.
868201633020354563 2017-05-26 20:26:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @travelinlady99 @LBVotingBlue Are we going to have to apologize to every single country (and the Vatican) for the trash we are sending them as ambassadors?
868117555247972352 2017-05-26 14:52:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @intelligencer @SafetyPinDaily The stupidity and hypocrisy cling to trump like swamp muck.
868117172089958401 2017-05-26 14:50:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @DoubleXMag @SafetyPinDaily I find the smiling faces while stabbing people in the back ( hear me Ann Wagner?) to be representative of our "wonderful" administration.
868115481940688896 2017-05-26 14:43:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @jsiterlet When you quote infowars & Alex Jones & support drump you lose all credibility. When you're in the swamp it's hard to see moral high ground.
868114344806166529 2017-05-26 14:39:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 @jsiterlet You live in an alternate reality if you can say the left legitimized violence with a straight face. Take off the blinders & see 45* clearly.
867961401242824704 2017-05-25 04:31:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @charlesjaco1 Unfortunately the actions of Gianforte do reflect the attitude of many in Montana. And that is very sad. I guess you get what you pay for.
867885493345759232 2017-05-25 23:30:00 UTC <sally_dehner> Well 45* is either bad/very bad or evil/very evil depending on your viewpoint.https://twitter.com/maggienyt/status/867837375627513856
867884707865927680 2017-05-25 23:26:53 UTC <sally_dehner> Lucky that the Prime Minister of Montenegro wasn't related to Gianforte. There could have been a body-slam.https://twitter.com/brianmoore666/status/867765390478331904

867842345009643521 2017-05-25 20:38:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @clantro @kayleighmcenany @Eddied80 @weightman_gary3 @smasiello213 A Christian=a person who follows Jesus' teachings in the Bible. Suggest starting with Matthew 25. Assuming 45* supporters read?
867833394360614913 2017-05-25 20:02:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @clantro @kayleighmcenany @Eddied80 @smasiello213 @weightman_gary3 And I would put on the v hat this very minute if it would either wake you up or shut you up :)
867832999089496065 2017-05-25 20:01:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @clantro @kayleighmcenany @Eddied80 @smasiello213 @weightman_gary3 Are you talking to me?? Where is this paycheck you speak of? No I speak against drump for free and for freedom. 45* on judgement day-hot!!
867830747712946176 2017-05-25 19:52:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @clantro @kayleighmcenany @weightman_gary3 @Eddied80 @smasiello213 Eddie's got good vision.
867830565822763008 2017-05-25 19:51:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @clantro @kayleighmcenany @weightman_gary3 @Eddied80 @smasiello213 Everytime you people say things like that about drump it's hard to get anything done because it takes so long for us to stop laughing.

867409978033930240 2017-05-24 16:00:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @NickSurgey @lhfang @SafetyPinDaily This is what lobbyists and big money are doing to our nation. Congress listens to them, not to us.
867409353002897408 2017-05-24 15:58:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @nycjayjay I think Barack and Michelle had each other's backs. The current couple seems more likely to stab each other in the back.
867377728621883392 2017-05-24 13:52:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @cwarzel @SafetyPinDaily The Gateway city is embarrassed to be in any way linked to drivel like "Gateway Pundit."
867365332020809730 2017-05-24 13:03:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @USATODAY @SafetyPinDaily @Cassiel_Angelos I was an Independent until the Republican platform and useless Republican Congress people (thank you Blunt and Wagner) turned me away.
867153988059365378 2017-05-23 23:03:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @seanhannity Is it possible that people, ordinary people, just don't like you, your show, your words, your actions, your ideas? Yep, that's it.
867152453447409664 2017-05-23 22:57:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis I wonder if Sean Hannity believes in karma. (Cue Twilight Zone music).
866528250805268480 2017-05-21 05:36:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @BattleMantee Red tape to you, clean stream protection to the rest of us. Go ahead and destroy the environment to add a few jobs to a dying industry.
866505451315265536 2017-05-21 04:06:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @BattleMantee Huh? Where, when and how?
866460492646232064 2017-05-21 01:07:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @BattleMantee Why do moderates who just want jobs vote Republican? R's say jobs but mean corporate profit. Read between the lines. It's not about us.
866107143656755200 2017-05-20 01:43:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @Bahamajoe0 @Luke4Tech No BS stories. The resistance is alive and well. We will take our country back from this greedy group. Make America safe-impeach & imprison.

865908601214390272 2017-05-20 12:34:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @Landorcan 1st time in South as a child in the 50's I was confused. Thought Civil War was history but they treated it like current events.
865905859314036738 2017-05-20 12:23:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag Humor for breakfast. Charm offensive in the person of 45*? He's going to talk about justice, citizen's rights and good governance? LOL.
865774350842155012 2017-05-19 03:41:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @POTUS @SarahHuckabee @SHSanders45 The real patriotic, hard working Americans wouldn't be caught dead at a drump rally. We are too busy trying to save our country.
865717837691850752 2017-05-19 23:56:31 UTC <sally_dehner> If anyone should be criticizing education it would be those of us who see how it let down citizens who literally voted against themselves.https://twitter.com/SafetyPinDaily/status/865716544541777920

864934809642074113 2017-05-17 20:05:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @DongWrangler You are kidding right? If we deserved the unfounded comment about EMAILS we certainly deserved to know the FBI had reservations about drump.
864705098198417409 2017-05-16 04:52:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @ALT_uscis This email smells of bs-45* has filled the swamp to overflowing and made his administration the special interest capitol. What a stench.
864697125912940544 2017-05-16 04:20:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @DongWrangler Funny how tRump loved Comey during and after election. But when 45* is being investigated? Not so much.
864696353171140610 2017-05-16 04:17:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @DongWrangler Comey made bad decision during election. Any FBI director investigating tRump Russian collusion would also have been out the door.
864681669835583488 2017-05-16 03:19:09 UTC <sally_dehner> I swear us leftist hooligans are the scariest thing going. Apparently middle aged and senior women scare the shit out of Ann.https://twitter.com/charlesjaco1/status/864669556060672000
864681006669889537 2017-05-16 03:16:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @jonfavs Can't find reference but thought I read he gave a little smile when he heard on TV he'd been fired. A smile that said " I've got you now. "?
864680003467960321 2017-05-16 03:12:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner @charlesjaco1 Apparently she communicates with her constituents by appearing on right wing media. But I don't listen to fake news so no communication.
864633789699457025 2017-05-16 00:08:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @DongWrangler No flip flop. If Comey had been fired as he should have been over inappropriate letter during election  we'd now be against firing whoever.
864301436456378368 2017-05-15 02:08:15 UTC <sally_dehner> @ivory_smiles @memearchive Was this a copy of a tRump tweet?
864238653031280641 2017-05-15 21:58:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @NTheodorak @SafetyPinDaily Your response to our response is even creepier.
864215672544530432 2017-05-15 20:27:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @atrupar @SafetyPinDaily Wrong in 2 many ways 2 count. How dare he use a relationship with a wealthy donor 2 suppress free speech. Demo of why we we oppose his kind.
863853561742077952 2017-05-14 20:28:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @operaandthecity @davidrieff Was that comment for Oliver or me? You can protest the truth but it's still the truth. Bottom of the barrel is bottom of the barrel.
863584973290385408 2017-05-13 02:41:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @tonysballerina My number 1 reason for NOT voting for tRump #SCOTUS #Garland. Second reason #dunce#unqualified#pussygrabber
863582319373897728 2017-05-13 02:30:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @SethAbramson @OlegTom Only trumpets are blind enough not to see what is going on right in front of them. Sorry I maligned a fine musical instrument.
863581956331757568 2017-05-13 02:29:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @TuckerCarlson @OlegTom Gag, yuck, etc. No way does this country need Gowdy. Time and tons of money wasted by this tinpot on the Clinton mirage.
863491143685767169 2017-05-13 20:28:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @operaandthecity @davidrieff Remember what I said about tRump? Bottom of the barrel intellect, temperament even lower.
863446601796333570 2017-05-13 17:31:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @ChelseaClinton I recommend turning over those who can't speak English well or can't spell to ICE immediately. tRump, "Who is that knocking at my door?"

863444108387463174 2017-05-13 17:21:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag @ericgeller Please not Gowdy. His relentless spending of obscene amounts of money to try to bring Hillary Clinton down was ridiculous.
863203680996274176 2017-05-12 01:26:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark Of course I wanted to answer Ryan Zinke's BS.

862720021834891265 2017-05-11 17:24:16 UTC <sally_dehner> @lisaghlisa @cvian87 @mergerguy Schools taking leaf out of business playbook. Pay CEO big bucks to get better outcome instead of more workers/teachers & better pay?
862718663937236992 2017-05-11 17:18:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @lisaghlisa @cvian87 @texascmr Cindy, you've been in the classroom? Why do you think we are failing and falling backwards? Surely charter schools are not the magic bullet.
862718051627696129 2017-05-11 17:16:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @lisaghlisa @cvian87 @texascmr Cindy, maybe because my area has welcomed a lot of immigrants that I see such children thriving and excelling. Drive to succeed? More help?
862526927835455488 2017-05-10 04:36:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @lisaghlisa @cvian87 @texascmr Have you noticed some of the best students we produce are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Same schools, different results. Why?
862506786703769605 2017-05-10 03:16:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m Insurance companies unhappy because they are not profiting off of ACA. They are excited about trumpnocare because they smell money.
862498448729411584 2017-05-10 02:43:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @politicususa @SafetyPinDaily Why would we want someone under investigation to appoint a new FBI director. 45* is not qualified to choose the WH lawn service.
862497856200073219 2017-05-10 02:41:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m Funny, the "horrible" ACA has huge support, made healthcare accessible AND affordable for millions. AHCA, a major disaster waiting to happen
862496997915459588 2017-05-10 02:38:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m Disaster waiting to happen. DeVos was chosen to be the agent of an agenda that does not serve us but those who want to profit off education.
862496157683122176 2017-05-10 02:34:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @lisaghlisa @mergerguy You don't build a better building by tearing it down and reconstructing it with shoddy materials because the contractor took all the money.
862493931430436865 2017-05-10 02:25:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @lisaghlisa @cvian87 @mergerguy Your response suggests public school education falls on deaf ears for some. But charter school probably wouldn't have helped either.
862486360359391235 2017-05-10 01:55:47 UTC <sally_dehner> If you mean too many administrators not enough teachers, I've said that myself. If you are blaming immigrants I am stopping you right now.
862482228445679617 2017-05-10 01:39:22 UTC <sally_dehner> DeVos IS old. Allow teachers to teach; provide every classroom with proper teaching tools. Don't expect teachers to stock the classroom.
862481262321311744 2017-05-10 01:35:31 UTC <sally_dehner> Yep, Mr. Schiff. You nailed it.https://twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/862433638385803264

862479718196662273 2017-05-10 01:29:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @lisaghlisa @cvian87 Statistics on poor outcomes of charter schools? Statistics on how much DeVos spent getting her dream job?
862479066192130048 2017-05-10 01:26:48 UTC <sally_dehner> Charter schools have served well? Not hardly. Given red state voter discernment, yes education needs improvement. Don't destroy it, fix it.
862393346169483265 2017-05-10 19:46:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m Who really benefits from vouchers? Wealthy students who get breaks. Who loses? Poor students who end up in underfunded & segregated schools.
862392788029243392 2017-05-10 19:43:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m Quote of former Michigan superintendent "In a number of cases people are making a boatload of money & the kids aren't getting educated."
862390759852572672 2017-05-10 19:35:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m When tRump demanded all TV's at the EPA be on Fox?  That was censorship.
862389420690997248 2017-05-10 19:30:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m tRump's voucher crap or Betsy's? She loves vouchers & was chosen specifically for her stance. Didn't know a thing about public education.
862383983954456576 2017-05-10 19:08:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m For DeVos it is all about money, funding, profit.  She doesn't seem to understand actual education at all.
862383413327798276 2017-05-10 19:06:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m ACA would work better without health insurers controlling costs.  No one should profit off our healthcare. ACA needed tweeks. AHCA yuck!
862382519207030786 2017-05-10 19:03:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m I have seen the results of charter schools & recognize vouchers will undermine public education. Rural schools will be particularly hit.

862380242266185728 2017-05-10 18:54:06 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke Are you talking to me??  I am proud of my public education.  My rational thinking seems to bother you.  Why is that?
862379897003663361 2017-05-10 18:52:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @collins11_m @ChadBurke I wish you and Betsy and all the current Congress & administration had to go teach for a week in a public school and see how you make out.
862379532917116929 2017-05-10 18:51:17 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @collins11_m @ChadBurke Wait until Voucher DeVos gets done, you'll see crap.  And it is not true that schools can't get rid of bad teachers.
862376999729467393 2017-05-10 18:41:13 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke Biggest snowflake? 45*. BLM is not your enemy. White privilege in need of a takedown. Parents are as responsible as teachers for last place.

862374605411028992 2017-05-10 18:31:42 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke Are you asking about her motives? Have you looked at her past, her connections? Look up Matt Blunt. Interesting story of influence for money
862374002937004040 2017-05-10 18:29:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 @ChadBurke @collins11_m Appointed to dismantle public ed. Used her family money to influence establishing for profit charter schools. Tweets can't list it all.
862369802798727173 2017-05-10 18:12:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 Booing DeVos may have been a lack of manners but it was out of an understanding of her motives.  She is not fighting for them or any child.
862369296084860941 2017-05-10 18:10:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @charliekirk11 Voucher DeVos was appointed to dismantle public education. I would have booed too. She should never have been invited.

862292743367913472 2017-05-10 13:06:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner 2 people were missing from your town hall meeting; I had a church meeting. What was your excuse?
861813016370839552 2017-05-08 05:20:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @Cernovich Mike, you must be wearing the tRump blinders and earplugs because you are also clueless.  When you win by cheating things don't go well.
861812483635458048 2017-05-08 05:18:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump How do you keep from running into walls in the WH when wearing blinders and earplugs?  At least I assume that is why you are clueless.
861778218164129792 2017-05-08 03:01:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @Newsweek @SafetyPinDaily Why does Kentucky want to be in the forefront of being backward?

861776676384124928 2017-05-08 02:55:45 UTC <sally_dehner> Reading tweets from 45* & can't decide whether to laugh or cry. Dumb, rude, delusional, clueless shouldn't be words to describe a president.
861775121698222080 2017-05-08 02:49:34 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump there is no fake media (well maybe Fox & Breitbart) but there is definitely a fake presidency. Stop your nonsense.
861747175142936576 2017-05-08 00:58:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump Considering millions were spent on a useless investigation of Ms Clinton, I think we can afford to investigate you until we get the truth.

860484125387616257 2017-05-05 13:19:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @atrupar @SafetyPinDaily Says he relies on staff and committees. Be honest, you also rely on lobbyists to tell you what to vote on.

860168423212494848 2017-05-04 16:25:07 UTC <sally_dehner> To congress; may the bird of paradise shit on your head if you destroy the ACA and stick trumpnocare in it's place.https://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/860160884613804033
859972359633108992 2017-05-03 03:26:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag How come drump heeds the pleas of corporations but is totally deaf to the voices of the ordinary citizens he's supposed to serve?

859835096261693440 2017-05-03 18:20:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @jk_rowling And some of us are jealous that you don't have to have drump in your life.

859081626013372417 2017-05-01 16:26:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @hulu @HandmaidsOnHulu @lovingscifi We worry about our sister's freedoms in foreign countries but we must not neglect protecting our own. 45* administration smells of Isis?
859081171715723266 2017-05-01 16:24:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @hulu @HandmaidsOnHulu @lovingscifi 45* a few steps away from jailing opposition, Pence would have a Christian Isis in place. Ladies, the burka is not far behind.
859028742085148672 2017-05-01 12:56:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @BenKentish @SafetyPinDaily So swearing to uphold & defend the Constitution was just another 45* lie?
859023242299879426 2017-05-01 12:34:35 UTC <sally_dehner> @HuffPostPol @SafetyPinDaily 45* saying ACA will cover people beautifully is a reminder that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
858524206555963393 2017-04-29 03:31:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @shirenar Fox news, conservative radio etc.?  Yeah right.  There's a reason it's called Faux News.  Brainwashing with alternative facts everyday.
858059511919251456 2017-04-28 20:45:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark @Fanny57 Exxon will be much happier in the future; there will be no Clean Air Act to hold them accountable. "Yay! We can pollute all we want to!"
858055135603429381 2017-04-28 20:27:40 UTC <sally_dehner> @intelligencer @SafetyPinDaily End of Fox News as we know it. Would that not be a win for our nation and an informed citizenry?
858049012615847936 2017-04-28 20:03:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @EdMazza @realDonaldTrump @SafetyPinDaily What is that sound I hear? It's millions of people laughing hysterically. Only these 2 brain dead Fox dudes would think 45* was "perfect".
857276185574854657 2017-04-26 16:52:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @Independent @SafetyPinDaily Surely trumpets didn't expect 45* to propose a big tax cut for the middle class. Oh wait, they were expecting that? April Fools everyday.
857267184669798402 2017-04-26 16:16:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @olliemilman @SafetyPinDaily The only thing 45* is interested in protecting is his business empire.
857266756758515712 2017-04-26 16:14:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @resnikoff @SafetyPinDaily Our current president seems to be very fond of blowing things up.
856903856546086914 2017-04-25 16:12:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @thehill @SafetyPinDaily Apparently WH is launching a new comedy site because with tRump in charge we all need a little humor. First post-giggles over AP interview.
856317690834800645 2017-04-23 01:23:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark They were just playing a game with Sarah P. But they didn't know she wasn't home. She was actually being an embarrassment at the White House
855937687206940673 2017-04-22 00:13:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @Slate @SafetyPinDaily A lot of us don't think Jeff Sessions is a real attorney general. What was his worst subject in school? History? Geography?
854689186783387648 2017-04-19 13:32:36 UTC <sally_dehner> @Sarcasticluther @jenny_adkins Current cultural issues or historical gender issues highlighted? I'm with the second interpretation.
853840930801152000 2017-04-16 05:21:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @NathanDamigo @Joan_of_Snarc @AngeloJohnGage @Software_Guy Can't blame someone for wanting to protest neo-nazi dopes. Hate to bring this up but apparently she has something in common with FLOTUS.
853818077364060162 2017-04-16 03:51:07 UTC <sally_dehner> @NathanDamigo @AngeloJohnGage @Joan_of_Snarc @tomstedham Follow a code of honor like the Resisters do. Look at the hundreds of protests Sat; do you see violence and riots? No tRump thugs; no riots.
853816152128139264 2017-04-16 03:43:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @NathanDamigo @Joan_of_Snarc @Software_Guy @AngeloJohnGage Wrong. Check the angle. He's punching, she's defending. Love yellow jacket "Jesus will judge" guy kicking. He may not like judgment day.
853815464040050688 2017-04-16 03:40:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @NathanDamigo @AngeloJohnGage @Joan_of_Snarc Look at this picture from another angle he is punching her, she is defending herself. Threats won't stop resistance. Capisce, tRump thugs?
853698587980697601 2017-04-16 19:56:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @ACLU The rallies yesterday were small? Not! People were paid to protest? No!  The election is over? Yes but you can't stop talking about it.
853623402250285056 2017-04-16 14:57:33 UTC <sally_dehner> @Mikel_Jollett @TexitDarling @run4pizzapie Make up your mind!! If we are equal give us equal pay, equal status, equal rights and I'd gladly punch that alt right sucker myself.
853622967762341890 2017-04-16 14:55:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk @Mikel_Jollett Compare the hundreds of thousands protesting yesterday in cities big and small to the protest in Berkeley. Violence? Not from the left.
853622188817207297 2017-04-16 14:52:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @RVAwonk @Mikel_Jollett And the guy with the "Jesus will judge you" jacket is kicking people? Gotta love those "non-violent" God-fearing alt right people.
853601123898359809 2017-04-16 13:29:01 UTC <sally_dehner> @_adaughterofg0d Just saw this; a little late but I know God used you to share the good news. Happy Easter!
853447993638440963 2017-04-15 03:20:32 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @GeorgeTakei @justinhendrix Very impressive. Thanks to all who stand against the secrecy and lies of this administration. Show me yours, I'll show you mine. #ImfromMO
853093036431212545 2017-04-14 03:50:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @maddow @kylegriffin1 I have a voice and I use it. I live in a blue county in a red state. Thank God for Claire McCaskill because the Blunt one tries my soul.
853046775262961664 2017-04-14 00:46:14 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Log a secret because of national security risks or tRump security risks? Hmmm.
853046197065584640 2017-04-14 00:43:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Who visits the WH? 45* will never tell. An administration of questionable ethics & secrecy. He can take the log when he leaves, soon I hope.
852961345414864903 2017-04-14 19:06:46 UTC <sally_dehner> @maddow @kylegriffin1 So if we are not dyed in the wool elephants we have no say? The next elections will be interesting. Dems have been complacent; not anymore.

852756896289218562 2017-04-13 05:34:22 UTC <sally_dehner> @maddow @kylegriffin1 He doesn't represent GOP constituents. He represents ALL constituents. At least that was the theory before Citizen United. We are watching.
852755565960806400 2017-04-13 05:29:05 UTC <sally_dehner> This would be a good start. Bet we could find even more waste if we keep looking.https://twitter.com/noracistbigots/status/852743294287134720
852221816219238400 2017-04-12 18:08:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @travelinlady99 @kenvogel And tRump profited from that piece of cake because us taxpayers paid Mar A Lago for it.  Well at least it was a beautiful piece of cake.
852216966098165761 2017-04-12 17:48:52 UTC <sally_dehner> @EPA @chrislhayes @K8brannen @blissful1985 I'm from MO; I say show us your resignation letter.
852216530930716672 2017-04-12 17:47:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @EPA @AltYelloNatPark @K8brannen Interesting to realize progressive women are so strong we frighten men like Scott Pruitt who know they do evil and fear the retribution.
852215147540226051 2017-04-12 17:41:39 UTC <sally_dehner> @AltYelloNatPark Not good at recognizing animal poop ;better at recognizing shitty people like Spicer and the rest of the 45* posse.
852190686921318404 2017-04-12 16:04:27 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepublicanChick Companies don't create jobs to thank us. I hope that was satire.
852190340635385858 2017-04-12 16:03:04 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepublicanChick Thank us by creating jobs? How about thanks for working so we can have a product to sell & our bottom line looks good? Not feeling love.
852189190062256129 2017-04-12 15:58:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepublicanChick Not necessarily good paying jobs(who needs minimum wage) & asking 4 and getting tax breaks and deregulation(oil, airlines, coal).
852172812970323968 2017-04-12 14:53:25 UTC <sally_dehner> Corporations never thank taxpayers. https://twitter.com/RepublicanChick/status/851990583304364032

852171565429129216 2017-04-12 14:48:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @AynRandPaulRyan Lawn sign: Trump for prison 2017.  Doesn't offend me; gives me hope.
852154032064004097 2017-04-12 13:38:48 UTC <sally_dehner> tRump's usual lies. Red state KS, even with tons of GOP $ couldn't sweep this one. 2 1/2 months of orange, KS no longer so red.https://twitter.com/mattmfm/status/852139382148665344
851989701796003840 2017-04-11 02:45:48 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing So sad that weird people like Larry Klayman actually have followers.

851646642184957952 2017-04-10 04:02:36 UTC <sally_dehner> I had no idea our Navy did this;I am appalled.  My first thought is to phone my congresspeople but frankly they are useless and don't listenhttps://twitter.com/zesty_leftwing/status/851638630498095104
851641687894093828 2017-04-10 03:42:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @FLSURFR I too wondered if the man had suffered a concussion.  United employees could've flown on competing airline, gotten there quicker, better PR
851629726024302593 2017-04-10 02:55:23 UTC <sally_dehner> Also lookups for re-accomodate and the antonym for good public relations are very popular.https://twitter.com/MerriamWebster/status/851480446064103447

851568298458263556 2017-04-10 22:51:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @thepileus @MaggieMcGo @DTJ_LG_CA Exactly. You & the airline have a contract with your purchase.  Does a store come & grab your toaster back; tell you 2 make toast tomorrow?
851562025742413827 2017-04-10 22:26:22 UTC <sally_dehner> Make Syria Bankrupt!  Actually his tomahawk strikes were just as effective as the way he ran trump airlines, casinos, steak, vodka etc.https://twitter.com/DearAuntCrabby/status/851390220633329664

851560180106108929 2017-04-10 22:19:02 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepDonBeyer @Antoniotuliomar Maybe you need new friends?
851559518869827588 2017-04-10 22:16:25 UTC <sally_dehner> @thepileus @JNasty720 @BobLoblawtx Because a gentleman refused to give up his lawfully purchased seat. I can't believe an airline can throw you off at random. Great publicity.
851557272358670336 2017-04-10 22:07:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @thepileus @JNasty720 @BobLoblawtx They needed 4 seats for employees; randomly chose passengers to take off the plane without their permission. Assault is legal for this?
851555513515094017 2017-04-10 22:00:30 UTC <sally_dehner> @thepileus @MaggieMcGo @DTJ_LG_CA I believe that asking him to leave because they needed his seat is a violation of a contract.
851555099373711361 2017-04-10 21:58:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @thepileus @jadealynn13 Why?  He paid for his seat. United has no right to randomly force people to give up their seat. United should have peacefully left him alone

850525230883885056 2017-04-07 01:46:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Actrually launching missiles turns a bumbling liar into ...a bigger bumbling liar.  Just read his old tweets about Syria.  Sheesh.
850524592082911235 2017-04-07 01:43:59 UTC <sally_dehner> @altUSEPA Actually very much part of the topic.  Our world is slowly being polluted; Supreme Court was next on the list.  Bad day on the Hill.
850523688898310144 2017-04-07 01:40:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing I say get rid of them both & the world will be a better place.  JK-the one who knows nothing and SB-the one who thinks he knows everything.
850523045567619072 2017-04-07 01:37:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Cindy Jacobs-the kind of person giving Christians a bad name. Right wingers glorifying the anti-Christ. How does her tongue not fall out?

850367379465011200 2017-04-07 15:19:16 UTC <sally_dehner> Frustrating to see ads for this guy. The only people voting yes on him are hypocrite Republicans who don't listen to their constituents.https://twitter.com/leftsideannie/status/849844576277864448

850207465325027328 2017-04-06 04:43:50 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Well his dad demonstrated that any idiot can run for office and with enough money and stupid people behind him he just might win.

849975179224731648 2017-04-06 13:20:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @DAPLFacts When you see "promoted" on a tweet it is advertising. Not necessarily facts promoted but advertising.
849829184184700928 2017-04-05 03:40:41 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing O'Reilly & tRump have a lot in common (smirk). Susan Rice is an intelligent, experienced civil servant; nothing in common with those dbags.
849736810452353026 2017-04-05 21:33:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing I thought the antiChrist was in power right now along with all his minions.

849397965135523840 2017-04-04 23:07:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenateMajLdr Not an impressive nomination; a 45* nomination which automatically makes Gorsuch unexceptable.  How dare you try these tactics.
849397601212542976 2017-04-04 23:05:43 UTC <sally_dehner> @SenateMajLdr The right thing to do is to vote no on Gorsuch and hold a hearing on Garland.  Citizens do not want Gorsuch as a judge.  Listen to us!!
849396647167741952 2017-04-04 23:01:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepVirginiaFoxx Looking at the picture of you with 45* when he nullified Fair Pay & Safe Workplaces-HJ Res 37. You should be ashamed.
849396030953148416 2017-04-04 22:59:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepLizCheney Also when 45* nullified Fair Pay & Safe Workplaces-HJ Res 37. How could two women actually stand by his side over that? Embarrased by you 2.

848223814588694528 2017-04-01 17:21:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @yountzee_ @PosiFawn Marissa, I was going to send you this until I saw you retweeted it! :)  You can do it! And you've got lots of support and prayers.
848222665378811904 2017-04-01 17:16:57 UTC <sally_dehner> @Donthecon @zesty_leftwing @donthecon you knew when you ran for president you would need to move to the WH. If you want your family in NY that is on your dime.
848221012177158147 2017-04-01 17:10:23 UTC <sally_dehner> @Cardinals @DexterFowler If it doesn't have a two hour wait it might not serve a very good breakfast.
847941443712843779 2017-03-31 22:39:28 UTC <sally_dehner> @jk_rowling @Ellelque LMAO! But wait, what about bow ties? Never gonna look at men's ties quite the same way :)
847656428986744834 2017-03-30 03:46:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alyssa_Milano @OregonBiker Dumb answer but I would support drug testing for Congress, the president and his entire staff. Only drugs could explain their idiocy.
847637001650159622 2017-03-30 02:29:44 UTC <sally_dehner> @GeorgeTakei @nycjayjay If anything happens to Flynn before he testifies tRump should automatically be impeached.
847635670633824256 2017-03-30 02:24:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @22_Minutes Like the changes to EPA. Take out Environmental and Protection and what's left? An Agency with no purpose.
847544788786311168 2017-03-30 20:23:18 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag @politico Pretty sure he leaked 2005 so want to see every one since then including 2016.
847544045434003457 2017-03-30 20:20:21 UTC <sally_dehner> No means NO.https://twitter.com/senschumer/status/847445983562571778
847542437333655553 2017-03-30 20:13:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Pence is a putz.
847541769529171968 2017-03-30 20:11:19 UTC <sally_dehner> Got a call from NRA asking me to tell Claire McCaskill to support Neil Gorsuch. NRA likes him? Another reason NOT to support him.
847301359837749251 2017-03-29 04:16:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alyssa_Milano @OregonBiker And how will necessary things like infrastructure, SS administration, veterans admin, etc. function?
847278333561683968 2017-03-29 02:44:31 UTC <sally_dehner> @davidmackau @amzieaa When he speaks I see those little cartoon bubbles over his head with "grab em by the pussy" or just "Tic Tacs".
847275087241674752 2017-03-29 02:31:37 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag @elianayjohnson tRump=stupid & dangerous. Freedom Caucus=not as stupid, still dangerous.
847274140457291778 2017-03-29 02:27:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alyssa_Milano @OregonBiker Or taxes going to corporate welfare, supporting destruction of environment, benefits for 1%, etc. Not buying it.
847273612687974408 2017-03-29 02:25:45 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alyssa_Milano @OregonBiker 309,349,688 people. Big population, small government, don't think so. Would taxes then be used wisely or go to ?
847202358824259584 2017-03-29 21:42:37 UTC <sally_dehner> Assume Devos was doing a breakout session on how to win a cabinet seat by wise use of political donations.https://twitter.com/RSBNetwork/status/847164420509913089
847153172313522184 2017-03-29 18:27:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @tedlieu @ccgm348 Is there even one ethical and legal person in this entire administration? Would like a name; will congratulate them.
847152107643977733 2017-03-29 18:22:56 UTC <sally_dehner> @Alyssa_Milano @OregonBiker Biker Al, you're why I donated to Ossoff. Liberals protecting our nation. #ImfromMO.
847073981991731200 2017-03-29 13:12:29 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Personal opinion is tRump is combo of worst traits of Nixon and Reagan. God save the USA.
847072338348822534 2017-03-29 13:05:57 UTC <sally_dehner> Very chilling statistic.https://twitter.com/everytown/status/846924382186455040
846937178328436737 2017-03-28 04:08:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @deaconseps She could not nod her head because what she was hearing was alternative facts aka lies. You have to shake your head when lied to
846921605032923136 2017-03-28 03:07:00 UTC <sally_dehner> @grantsamms @mimimayes13 I am confused, are you suggesting current administration has common sense?? Have not noticed any so far.
846919796474163200 2017-03-28 02:59:49 UTC <sally_dehner> @rdrock180 Really don't think old white men with bald spots and ugly combovers should be pointing fingers at anyone's hairstyle.
846919198290927616 2017-03-28 02:57:26 UTC <sally_dehner> @oreillyfactor @LATiffani1 Of course we point out he's racist because...wait for it....he's a racist. Not a surprise. Always has been.
846839564505419776 2017-03-28 21:41:00 UTC <sally_dehner> This agency can no longer call itself EPA since there will be no protection of the environment.https://twitter.com/ungaggedepa/status/846837982703292417
846517523151552514 2017-03-27 00:21:19 UTC <sally_dehner> @zesty_leftwing Laughing so hard! tRump more likely to end up as fugitive on yacht.
846185805450268672 2017-03-26 02:23:12 UTC <sally_dehner> none are so blind...maybe when 45*& posse are in jail and health insurance totally ruined you will wake up and smell the coffee
846165500753252352 2017-03-26 01:02:31 UTC <sally_dehner> Fighting in the streets apparently has a whole different meaning for trumpets. Do I need to post pictures of what we mean?
846163820422873088 2017-03-26 00:55:50 UTC <sally_dehner> I watched your links. Fight in the streets, not kill or burn and Loretta was talking black people bleeding/dying. No evidence.
846162533966905344 2017-03-26 00:50:43 UTC <sally_dehner> Can show you a million facts on ACA and explain just how 45* is scary as heck & you will spout libtard/moron. Conversation over
846085391920844800 2017-03-26 19:44:11 UTC <sally_dehner> @lauriecrosswell You win!

846065661075951616 2017-03-26 18:25:47 UTC <sally_dehner> Before ACA millions had no insurance, had to rely on charity & thousands went bankrupt paying bills. Health not a profit maker!
846064273931620352 2017-03-26 18:20:16 UTC <sally_dehner> There is the difference between Dems and Republicans. Still Independent here but won't vote Republican until 45* is gone.
846063782401073153 2017-03-26 18:18:19 UTC <sally_dehner> And not from Gateway Pundit or Breitbart.Then listen to tRump on tape say beat the crap out of protesters;I'll pay legal fees.
846063329139404801 2017-03-26 18:16:31 UTC <sally_dehner> I'd like a link where Dems called for anything worse than shutting down streets and bridges and possibly burning the flag.
845972800867352577 2017-03-26 12:16:47 UTC <sally_dehner> guess Repubs win for being truthful. We are shit and we will do shit.
845972536940744705 2017-03-26 12:15:44 UTC <sally_dehner> Paul Ryan plans to have a part in it. Read his lips "we won't give up on destroying the healthcare system" old quote still true
845971608607055872 2017-03-26 12:12:03 UTC <sally_dehner> Yes Dems have done shit. Difference? Platform. Repubs SAY and DO shit. At least Dems believe in the good even when they mess up
845843877735120897 2017-03-25 03:44:30 UTC <sally_dehner> First time I saw "maga" I was like what's that? Looked it up and funny enough it stands for Metropolitan Amateur Golf Association.pic.twitter.com/oe6h6FtGCb
845803962548793346 2017-03-25 01:05:53 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag Here is a message for 45*, the Republican Congress and HHS. We will not stop our scrutiny; don't try to undermine the ACA.
845782001915441153 2017-03-25 23:38:37 UTC <sally_dehner> Since Repubs have pretty much become a corporate buyout and still hope to destroy the system, that's how it will work.
845733000805535745 2017-03-25 20:23:55 UTC <sally_dehner> @axios @NatashaBertrand @BrianAbrams And the people said you have no choice but to drop this bill. We the people have the power.
845692152902508544 2017-03-25 17:41:36 UTC <sally_dehner> Mostly worried 45* gets off on the idea of our healthcare insurance exploding and doesn't have a clue how to "piece" anything together.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/845645916732358656
845497903292534785 2017-03-24 04:49:43 UTC <sally_dehner> Not sure I get you but assume you mean economics will sink ACA. I believe Republican and corporate greed will try to do it in. See who wins. https://twitter.com/blameocrats/status/845425847502823424
845496876581433344 2017-03-24 04:45:38 UTC <sally_dehner> @jonfavs Thank you for this statement; I hadn't thought of it in those terms.  You make me feel so proud of every phone call, tweet, email.

845388283710509060 2017-03-24 21:34:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @TEN_GOP Typical alt facts from 45*.  American citizens won today and Pelosi and Schumer, other Reps are heroes not losers.
845387386179764226 2017-03-24 21:30:34 UTC <sally_dehner> It's Friday afternoon; we still have Obamacare. Crisis averted!  Make retaining the EPA your next "triumph" and ditch the death budget OK?https://twitter.com/ArtsGuySD/status/845380802435170304
845386223690698752 2017-03-24 21:25:56 UTC <sally_dehner> Maybe if you would not vacation so much you would have time to work on thisissue.  How about burying the AHCA and make the ACA even better?https://twitter.com/PattiKimble/status/845379499269214209
845380695350480897 2017-03-24 21:03:58 UTC <sally_dehner> @1776Stonewall Huh?
845363603553300480 2017-03-24 19:56:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @SpeakerRyan Don't keep postponing; KILL the BILL.
845319334151016449 2017-03-24 17:00:09 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner Tried to reach you by phone this morning; left a message.  So here it is in writing: protect us-vote NO on the AHCA.
845311722797850626 2017-03-24 16:29:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @POLITICOMag Who cares? Just dump them all and start over. The entire Congress and current administration is a sorry mess.
845310899875463170 2017-03-24 16:26:38 UTC <sally_dehner> I just supported Kathryn Allen on @Crowdpac! https://www.crowdpac.com/campaigns/181376/the-us-congress-needs-a-caring-physician. Let's get rid of the mess in the house. Go Kathryn!
845158573432700928 2017-03-23 06:21:20 UTC <sally_dehner> @MikeFeller1 I'll put a picture on my tweet when I decide whether I should wink or stick out my tongue or both depending on recipient.
845145375795167233 2017-03-23 05:28:54 UTC <sally_dehner> @davidcicilline If Ann Wagner were honest she'd admit she's received way more opposition than support for AHCA.  Wish you were my rep.
845033700547006464 2017-03-23 22:05:08 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner Friends say they got robo calls asking for them to call you with support of AHCA. Not going to happen because we hate the AHCA
845005063953301505 2017-03-23 20:11:21 UTC <sally_dehner> @clairecmc @RepAnnWagner @MikeFeller1 Worst idea I've heard all day. That's saying something with cong/presidential stupidity all around.
844997641427701761 2017-03-23 19:41:51 UTC <sally_dehner> @RepAnnWagner Absolutely imperative that you, as the representative for Missouri citizens, vote down this horrible version of the AHCA.
844988914297438208 2017-03-23 19:07:10 UTC <sally_dehner> @sherlocked1058 @chrislhayes @ccgm348 Dang, healthcare is complicated. Difference of two programs: ACA-for citizens/AHCA-against citizens.
844917659401682944 2017-03-23 14:24:02 UTC <sally_dehner> This statement boggles my mind. I can't believe our nation has come to this point. Can we somehow get back on track? What do we need to do?https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/844871036050956288
844916732083032065 2017-03-23 14:20:21 UTC <sally_dehner> This is turning into a very dark blot on the fabric of our nation.https://twitter.com/charlesjaco1/status/844900327631589377
844916384522010626 2017-03-23 14:18:58 UTC <sally_dehner> This worries me. I believe confirmation hearings should be suspended right now until the questions about this presidency are answered.https://twitter.com/georgetakei/status/844891644239499266

844543285809041408 2017-03-22 13:36:24 UTC <sally_dehner> @realDonaldTrump @grose65511 What about tRump supporters that speak English atrociously. Can we make them leave also??

841350912400601089 2017-03-13 18:11:03 UTC <sally_dehner> @ProTrump001 @TwitterMoments @LiberatedCit so to understand King I need to read a conservative "news" site? That makes sense.

840689562854838272 2017-03-11 22:23:05 UTC <sally_dehner> @desertveteran OK? That the WH is full of liars and traitors? Conman is the golfer in chief and conman jr lies with a straight face? OK?
