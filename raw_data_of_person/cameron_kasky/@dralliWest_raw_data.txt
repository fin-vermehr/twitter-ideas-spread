751669584877350912 2016-07-08 06:49:29 UTC <dralliWest> If praying worked, this wouldn't keep happening. #DoSomethingForDallas and everywhere else where events like this have become a commonality.
750154994125602816 2016-07-04 02:31:02 UTC <dralliWest> Can we all decide as a society to stop playing the Cupid Shuffle
746863896003227648 2016-06-25 00:33:23 UTC <dralliWest> @dralliWest a lifeless infant cow*
746861470571442176 2016-06-25 00:23:45 UTC <dralliWest> And you haven't experienced loss or adversity.
746852235661967360 2016-06-25 23:47:03 UTC <dralliWest> PSA: If you haven't watched a baby animal die in your hands, you don't know what money is or how the world works.
746777540426096640 2016-06-25 18:50:14 UTC <dralliWest> If you want to get into a public policy debate with me, at the very least know what you're talking about so it's not so goddamn easy.
745788178309734400 2016-06-22 01:18:52 UTC <dralliWest> @laurennring in theory they're not, but in practice, people of color oftentimes receive harsher penalties for the same crime
745783640731299845 2016-06-22 01:00:50 UTC <dralliWest> @laurennring How hard is it to understand that minorities are disproportionately affected by our justice system in negative ways?
745685782841688064 2016-06-22 18:31:59 UTC <dralliWest> How can you sit there and tell me that it makes sense for someone on the no-fly list to be able to buy a gun? #NoFlyNoBuy
742129490957062145 2016-06-12 23:00:33 UTC <dralliWest> God, real or not, doesn't affect policy. If you want the world to change, work for it. Let your voice be heard.
742128848066772992 2016-06-12 22:58:00 UTC <dralliWest> Praying for people is a nice gesture, but if you really care you must realize that folding your hands and bowing your head won't fix wrongs.
740955903768289281 2016-06-09 17:17:08 UTC <dralliWest> @michell_zarate I didn't think you would do it

729731967902728192 2016-05-09 17:57:13 UTC <dralliWest> @abbystrohfeldt you made a typo
727680237107023872 2016-05-03 02:04:22 UTC <dralliWest> @Brendan_Blood25 @realDonaldTrump @JohnKasich that's mathematically impossible
727668938482528256 2016-05-03 01:19:29 UTC <dralliWest> Dying of laughter because @realDonaldTrump is almost certainly the next GOP nominee for President of the United States...

709036836107231232 2016-03-13 15:22:09 UTC <dralliWest> Trump refuses to recognize our 1st Amendment Rights to Speech, Assembly, Religion, and Press. This man cannot be president. VOTE PLEASE
709036115156725766 2016-03-13 15:19:17 UTC <dralliWest> If Trump is encouraging his supporters to assault protesters, what will he do to suppress citizens if he actually gets an army?
