Ur health will fail. U'll get Alzheimer's, dementia (u have it now) maybe Parkinson's. Soon u'll need help 2 pee & poop. I feel free already
972293279663484928 2018-03-09 02:09:16 UTC <janecly10> True. But Republicans don't care. It doesn't matter how many crimes we stack up against Trmp, Repubs will shield him. Hell, they won't even talk abt his crimes & ridiculous policy changes. I've never felt more helpless than I do w/ this moron in the WH.

956325323993382915 2018-01-24 00:38:19 UTC <janecly10> Sen, I think u need to be more outspoken against trump, his lying & the lack of an investigation into his sexual assaults against 20 women. It's not enough to just vote on key bills. Raise holy hell! I'm a Pointer, Mineral Point. I voted 4 you last time and I will again.https://twitter.com/SenatorBaldwin/status/956319707698642945
956323270994857984 2018-01-24 00:30:10 UTC <janecly10> wow. that's damn crazy. trump probably hasn't said boo abt this stat. actually he probably doesn't know abt it.https://twitter.com/PostScottWilson/status/955980369697763328
956321751868329986 2018-01-24 00:24:07 UTC <janecly10> Yes, but no wall funding. Trading DACA for the wall is a rip off. The wall represents everything Trmp is abt & the opposite of what the Dreamers & Ds r abt. If he gets his wall, it'll fundamentally change how the US deals w/immigration issues. It will embolden Trump. @SenSchumerhttps://twitter.com/omarvaid/status/956250215652188160

If he wins, the US will b even MORE divided & Trmp more obnoxious. His name calling & gloating drags us down & pumps up his base. He's weak w/lowest the rtgs ever. He cant win, it'll destroy us

954961688536723456 2018-01-20 06:19:43 UTC <janecly10> @PressSec Sarah, i figured u out. I always thought u came up w/ ur answers, or posts, on ur own & i hated u for it. Now I see u can't help it. U only exist via the toxic gas that comes out of Trump's ass. The ppl cn blow u off now. U really don't matter. U don't possess ur own mind anyway.
954959169328689152 2018-01-20 06:09:42 UTC <janecly10> @SenDuckworth Thank you for everything you said today about 5-deferment-Don You are an inspiration and a very bright star in the Senate. I wish you lived in Wisconsin, just so I could vote for you. Any thoughts on going against Trump in 2020? U'd beat him handily.
954901769825464321 2018-01-20 02:21:37 UTC <janecly10> @SenSchumer No wall Sen. The wall shldn't b on the table. A DHS inspection cld trigger a release of the funds that he needs for his wall. U must not let him have it. I don't know why I keep posting this. I think u might give him his wall.https://twitter.com/theycallme_tigs/status/954799876990156801

He shldn't have given all that money 2 the rich in his tax-scam. He's trampled on Ds. Rs haven't followed the rules in the Senate. Merrick Garland.

949847929422012416 2018-01-06 03:39:28 UTC <janecly10> He should have stepped down as the R candidate when the women came forward. than again, he should have never been allowed to run,, especially with those recordings of him that you mentioned.

Make a different deal. Saving DACA isnt heroic if u give him that wall. If u fund it, i won't be a D anymore & i'll work against Ds. U'll make him hero.

943951901539880961 2017-12-21 21:10:45 UTC <janecly10> Trump is setting up State TV w/ his Sinclair network. Without net neutrality, leaders cld decide what we, the ppl, can view on the web.

The Rs were mad & asked a cop 2 go get'em & put them in Madison. Cops cldn't cross the state line. W/out the Ds, Rs cldn't vote.

941197381034545153 2017-12-13 06:45:16 UTC <janecly10> Trump's the worst type of tool, primarily due to his inability to take responsibility. There's not a lot that's more annoying 2 me than this.

937121410656489473 2017-12-02 00:48:49 UTC <janecly10> Sen, when Ds take power back, u must treat these bad R Sen's the same as they treated Ds. I hope karma is in the cards 4 these greasy R Sen's.

It's textbook narcissistic pers. disor. It's not trivial. He has NO impulse ctrl. He taunts a NK nut w/nukes in dvlpmnt. He's unfit.U put party over USA
936385848177815552 2017-11-30 00:05:58 UTC <janecly10> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Thanks Rs for helping Ds flip the Hse & Sen blue. U've gone 2 far. U'll crash & burn. Ur igniting fires under Ds. Ur gonna fuel us to 2018. We'll make sure evry voter knows abt the BS in ur taxplan. Golf courses? Pvt planes? Really?
936382968276320256 2017-11-30 23:54:31 UTC <janecly10> i thought they were gonna keep the ind. mandate? not that it matters. their whole bill sucks. how can McCain vote for this if it cancels the ind mandate? why the hell did he vote no on their health care bill if he's going to help destroy the ACA.https://twitter.com/SenKamalaHarris/status/936340858240143360
936382152824053761 2017-11-30 23:51:17 UTC <janecly10> @tedlieu What's their endgame on the tax BS? Donors $ 2 fund elect. It shld Hurt Rs. Ds gotta teach what this BS is abt. White, low income ppl who vote R have voted against their own interest 4 too long. Ds must wrest them away by educ. Even if they just voted 4 moderate Rs, it wld help.
936379497561120768 2017-11-30 23:40:43 UTC <janecly10> @LindseyGrahamSC U say Trmp isn't ment. ill? Do u believe the women who have accused him? U went after Clinton 4 a blowjob.  Were u jealous? U say nothing abt Pres Predator. Going at a woman u don't know & 'grabbing her pussy' is pathological: narcissistic personality disorder.https://twitter.com/AynRandPaulRyan/status/936290144985825280
936376411320999936 2017-11-30 23:28:28 UTC <janecly10> @LindseyGrahamSC The press isnt saying Trmp's men. ill. It's pros/Drs & ppl w/experience. U don't have a clue. If u think he's sane, ur either nuts or stupid. Psych isnt rocket sci. Rd a book Sen. U likely think the Russ invest. is a waste. A sen cldn't b that stupid? or cld he..
936340557638533122 2017-11-30 21:05:59 UTC <janecly10> @SenJohnMcCain Pls dont vote 4 this bad taxplan. U've shown ur an honorable man & servant of All citizens, not just rich ppl.

936289068345909253 2017-11-30 17:41:23 UTC <janecly10> @SenJohnMcCain this is a shock. you know this is wrong Senator. You're borrowing from China 2 pay ur wealthy donors? that should be a criminal offense. Rs are definitely committing moral and ethical offenses in this bill. Trump tailor-made it 4 his family to reap & reap & that shld be a crime.
936288047875928064 2017-11-30 17:37:20 UTC <janecly10> @cmclymer You give your total truth here. That's astounding. I don't know you in real life, but I've enjoyed your tweets, especially re: depression which is my fight. You show such honesty here. You're the bravest person I know today.

935226015751770112 2017-11-27 19:17:12 UTC <janecly10> yes, trump has millions and millions of followers that will be posting anyway. i'm trying to work on not retweeting him when i'm angry at a post. i have little control when i'm upset w/what he says.

He doesn't believe Moore will win & after Tuesday, the R has to win, no matter the cost. Trmp's never liked Moore. I'm waiting to see who the new mega-Right non-controversial nominee is.
