967217658197356544 2018-02-23 02:00:34 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @sarahemclaugh My daughter's HS had a student led walkout during fifth bell. Her pre-calculus teacher took attendance then allowed them to walk out to the front circle area.  Students chanted & had posters.  Lasted 40 minutes. Was very civil & the Principal even came out to join. Was on TV.

I listened to your Uncle Fred's words and cried as I dropped my own daughter off at Walnut Hills.  We are so very sorry for your loss, Lisa Guttenberg.

965294183949971456 2018-02-18 18:37:22 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @davidfrum @ColMorrisDavis @AveryAdamms Me too! Young child of the 60's and child of the 70's. Loved School House Rock. I apologise to my daughters over and over for how the US is today. I never thought we would backslide so far. I wanted so much for them.
965278552580087809 2018-02-18 17:35:15 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @BoycottTaxes Thanks! Like yours too!

965249053608071168 2018-02-18 15:38:02 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @DSGA_SenRamirez @SenatorDurbin @surgtek Thank you! I am glad you are enjoying your grandkids! Oh, I hope you are right and things change for the better for all of our futures!
965242598192500736 2018-02-18 15:12:23 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @DSGA_SenRamirez @SenatorDurbin @surgtek I hope you are right. I worry a lot about the kind of future my girls will have. They both want to work very hard to earn their PhD and have fulfilling careers. Neither of them, right now, think that they want children.
965238796030799872 2018-02-18 14:57:16 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @DSGA_SenRamirez @SenatorDurbin @surgtek I grew up in Chicago and we only prepared with fire drills and tornado drills. I work in a hospital now and we do have active shooter drills.
965237894326743040 2018-02-18 14:53:41 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @DSGA_SenRamirez @SenatorDurbin @surgtek They have enough stress as it is just trying to do well and prepare for college or to continue to do well while in college. My oldest walked thru the area just 20 minutes before the OSU stabbing. Was in heart attack mode until she texted back.
965236734454792192 2018-02-18 14:49:05 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @DSGA_SenRamirez @SenatorDurbin @surgtek It is extremely heartbreaking. Never in a million years did I think I would have to talk with my 19 and 16 year olds (and even when they were  younger) about these kinds of things when I gave them life in 1998 and 2001. It's just crazy. Our relatives in Europe are stunned.
965228041256435717 2018-02-18 14:14:32 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @DSGA_SenRamirez @SenatorDurbin @surgtek Right, I told my 16 year old to only wear sneakers or low healed shoes so that she would be better prepared to run if a shooter came to her school. They already do active shooter drills. Also told her to call one of us and stay on her cell phone until we found her. So sad.
965206621893906434 2018-02-18 12:49:25 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @Alt_FedEmployee @Molly_NYC God, you're right. No, I couldn't imagine him as my father. My Father was an immigrant, learned English from TV, earned a Master's Degree at IIT in Chicago and worked for Sears Roebuck & Co for 20 years as his final employer. No, I couldn't imagine anything except a loving Dad.
965068345912553472 2018-02-17 03:39:58 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @Alt_FedEmployee How quickly would he change things if his own son was shot and killed at his elementary school by someone with an automatic rifle? Or any Republican if their child or grandchild was shot and killed? I WONDER........
964833849409712135 2018-02-17 12:08:10 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @aardman @Maisie_Williams @twhiddleston @EarlyManUS My 16 year old daughter and I saw it last night!  She grew up watching all of the Nick Park films #Wallace&Gromit etc. We both really loved #EarlyMan! It has an amazingly positive message. And, we love his signature bunny! GO SEE IT!

964487370035867648 2018-02-16 13:11:22 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> Around 7:00 this morning as I was dropping off my 16 yr old daughter at her high school, I heard on the radio the agonized description of Jaime Guttenberg by her Dad Fred Guttenberg. I was crying all the way home. We are excruciatingly heartbroken for you Fred & all the parents.
964356632737038336 2018-02-15 04:31:52 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @eugenegu So very heartbroken........
963378771087757313 2018-02-13 11:46:12 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @CMichaelGibson Fantastic diagrams! My oldest daughter is taking anatomy & physiology now at OSU for biomedical engineering. I'll show her your daughter's work. My youngest will be taking anatomy next year as a senior in highschool. She's going into pharmacogenetics for undergrad/masters program
963373874464337920 2018-02-13 11:26:44 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @Khanoisseur A family member has to deal with this every time he has to go to Bloomington to work for a week from Ohio. Pence is an asshole! It's all for the kickback! To hell with the citizens who have to use it!
961959040040480769 2018-02-09 13:44:42 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @RawStory I'd like to crush his cervical vertebrae and jab the pieces into his spinal cord resulting in 10/10 nerve pain in his back and arms/hands and see him go without opiods until surgery and post surgery! What an asshole! He has #NOCLUE!
960718698154807296 2018-02-05 03:36:01 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @Quicks35 @goodoldcatchy Oh my God! I was laughing and crying so hard as I read your tweet! It is insanely accurate! I LOVE IT. Gonna read it to my coworkers and to my family tomorrow! Please write more tweets like this!

959827054270275585 2018-02-03 16:32:57 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @ScaredyCatCW So sorry to read about your Kitty's illness. Hope the medicine works! I grew up with cats and experienced many types of illnesses, required medicines and even surgeries. My parents invested a lot of time, money, energy and love into all of our pet kitties.
959151113277669376 2018-02-01 19:47:00 UTC <LisaNGuttenberg> @realDonaldTrump @TheRynheart This is completely irresponsible! We must continue to provide aid!
