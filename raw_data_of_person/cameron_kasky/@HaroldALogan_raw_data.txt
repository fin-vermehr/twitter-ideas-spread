971593535232278528 2018-03-07 03:48:44 UTC <HaroldALogan> @cameron_kasky @27sportsman Hi REGISTER and OFFER, I'm SIGN UP TO VOTE BY MAIL. That keeps you from being impacted by long lines and voter suppression tactics, plus campaign volunteers can see that you've voted so you're one less phone to call and one less door to knock on. This is how we win.
971591128985292800 2018-03-07 03:39:11 UTC <HaroldALogan> Thanks for a fun interview @DPortno and @grahampotteruk and the rest of the @HeadsCloud team #headsinthecloud #friendofthecloudpic.twitter.com/RWfRjWti0a
971237434393493505 2018-03-06 04:13:43 UTC <HaroldALogan> @McJesse This made my day.
971183347975315456 2018-03-06 00:38:48 UTC <HaroldALogan> @cameron_kasky So much this. Voter registration data is publicly available from SOE's so I'm interested to see what the numbers look like before and after the 24th.
971177825700077568 2018-03-06 00:16:51 UTC <HaroldALogan> @Emma4Change @Yar2k20 Or vote blue for now while also advocating for Ranked Choice Voting. That's a thing.
971177550943866881 2018-03-06 00:15:46 UTC <HaroldALogan> @Emma4Change http://registertovoteflorida.gov is the URL for us Floridians. Also signing up to vote by mail makes things *so* much easier (you can still drop your ballot off in person).
971176786502586368 2018-03-06 00:12:44 UTC <HaroldALogan> Floridians age 16 and up, if you haven't registered / preregistered to vote yet you can do so at http://registertovoteflorida.gov.https://twitter.com/Emma4Change/status/970444468015964160
969356078839451653 2018-03-01 23:37:53 UTC <HaroldALogan> @alabamaredheadd I try to use that knowledge to help with empathizing - I figure when they see a gay couple kissing or a woman wearing a hijab, their brains light up kinda like mine does when I see a klansman wearing a white robe.

969354320058683392 2018-03-01 23:30:54 UTC <HaroldALogan> To the young people following politics more avidly: pay close attention. This is what politicians do when they aren't held accountable. Or better yet the GOP loves to pass laws, lose an election, and go to work for whomever offered the best gig as payback.http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/376311-mcconnell-shelves-gun-bills-for-banking-reform
969298003482865670 2018-03-01 19:47:07 UTC <HaroldALogan> @al3xw1nd A grieving nation stands with you. Be there for each other. Be well. And if you're so inclined, be ready to go to work getting everyone you know registered to vote and committed to voting in August and November.
969266903582756866 2018-03-01 17:43:32 UTC <HaroldALogan> @TomiLahren Army vet here, I've fired M16, M4, M60 and M249. Before Uncle Sam let me fire those I had to demonstrate that I could function in a high pressure situation and not snap. So please quit pretending that you're some kind of expert. You aren't. See the problem?
969264069772443648 2018-03-01 17:32:16 UTC <HaroldALogan> There's no patch for it either. AI-powered anomaly-based intrusion prevention? Maybe. But probably not.https://twitter.com/rebeccamkern/status/969235111639216128
969263370946990081 2018-03-01 17:29:30 UTC <HaroldALogan> D. All of the above.https://twitter.com/jonlovett/status/969262243115225089
969250517900779520 2018-03-01 16:38:25 UTC <HaroldALogan> @alabamaredheadd Are you familiar with any of the research on political mindsets and size of the amygdala? Short version: the person who sees a Muslim saying their morning prayers and reacts negatively to them, likely has a larger amygdala and therefore a stronger fear response.
969230884300820480 2018-03-01 15:20:24 UTC <HaroldALogan> @jennyjaffe Looks like we overshot, now you need to offend 30 people to get to 2,000 on the dot.

969082207880048646 2018-02-28 05:29:37 UTC <HaroldALogan> @GeorgeTakei They ran off to join Prudence, who hasn't been seen in the White House since January of 2017.
969080992387489792 2018-02-28 05:24:47 UTC <HaroldALogan> @AndrewGillum @botyler2014 My normal rule is that outlandish claims require extraordinary evidence. It's too bad neither you nor the would-be journalist organization you like to quote adheres to such a standard.
969080279385206784 2018-02-28 05:21:57 UTC <HaroldALogan> @AndrewGillum @botyler2014 Quite a few actually. It's rare for an article to rely entirely on unnamed sources; most will have a mix of named sources and those speaking on condition of anonymity. You didn't answer the question though. Have you asked for an authentic unedited image? If not then why not?
969079500997844992 2018-02-28 05:18:52 UTC <HaroldALogan> @AndrewGillum @botyler2014 That's the sort of thing little men tend to say.
968996448133140482 2018-02-28 23:48:50 UTC <HaroldALogan> @GoodforFlorida @1schneids I believe there was some outreach late in the campaign to registered NPA's. Speaking only for myself it seems like given the presence of a 3rd-party candidate, it wasn't clear how the independents would break.
968995252433510405 2018-02-28 23:44:05 UTC <HaroldALogan> @pattonoswalt You seem like an awesome human being. Be well sir.
968994768020746240 2018-02-28 23:42:10 UTC <HaroldALogan> @maggieNYT The maxim that normally applies is that outlandish claims require extraordinary evidence. I realize you can't divulge sources who spoke off-the-record, but can you confirm that your sources told you she was considering resigning *before* her "white lie" committee testimony?
968993443505758213 2018-02-28 23:36:54 UTC <HaroldALogan> @AndrewGillum @botyler2014 Interesting news source. Googling around I don't see the story picked up by any actual journalism outlets. Has a reputable organization validated the text message? Since TR didn't name sources, are they willing to share the original photo of the text? This one has been edited.
968990063760756736 2018-02-28 23:23:28 UTC <HaroldALogan> @AndrewGillum @botyler2014 (3/3)...the Mayor's office tweeted a correction, are you really hanging your hat on wrongdoing here? Would you stake your integrity on that? And is that the same integrity you're staking on everything else published on Tallahassee Reports?
968989943048605696 2018-02-28 23:23:00 UTC <HaroldALogan> @AndrewGillum @botyler2014 (2/3)...claimed Cruz as one of their own, as reported by multiple reputable organizations. 4. The Mayor's office posted a reaction to that report.  Considering the concerted efforts by 4chan trolls to muddy some already murky and emotional waters with misinformation, and that...
968989458635911168 2018-02-28 23:21:04 UTC <HaroldALogan> @AndrewGillum @botyler2014 (1/3) Okay so let's take this by the numbers. Consider the following statements: 1. A young person took 17 lives and injured many more in Parkland. 2. There is a paramilitary white supremacist group called the Republic of Florida. 3. Someone claiming to be a leader in the ROF...
968984810994786305 2018-02-28 23:02:36 UTC <HaroldALogan> @AndrewGillum @botyler2014 No worries little man, you aren't bursting a thing but I appreciate your concern. My point remains that guilty people don't generally push to have all of their records made public, and don't generally encourage investigators to move swiftly.
968976051379589120 2018-02-28 22:27:48 UTC <HaroldALogan> @AndrewGillum We're not politicizing the Parkland shooting; we're politicizing @marcorubio's inaction in response to every other shooting.
968975539733254144 2018-02-28 22:25:46 UTC <HaroldALogan> @botyler2014 @AndrewGillum *has* responded by asking the city to make the records handed over to the FBI available to the public (https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.tallahassee.com/amp/843472001#ampshare=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2017/11/08/gillum-calls-release-fbi-records-maddox-others/843472001) and by encouraging the FBI to pursue their investigation with alacrity (https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.tallahassee.com/amp/583150001#ampshare=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2017/08/19/gillum-asks-fbi-move-quickly-local-investigation/583150001/) unlike certain other elected officials...
968973436465876993 2018-02-28 22:17:24 UTC <HaroldALogan> @marcorubio We aren't politicizing gun violence. We're politicizing your inaction in the face of it.
968299735554625537 2018-02-26 01:40:21 UTC <HaroldALogan> @Emma4Change Did I read that you're coming to New College next year? If so, Sarasota is ready to welcome you with open arms.
968265302441111557 2018-02-26 23:23:32 UTC <HaroldALogan> I would say that's the case with *everything*, except that with IoT there's no way to close the barn door once thousands of vulnerable units are in the field.https://twitter.com/SecurityRT/status/968264588033540096
968264799699292163 2018-02-26 23:21:32 UTC <HaroldALogan> Would-be leaders dismiss young people at their peril: this is what a millennial-only electoral map looks like. As @davidhogg111 bluntly and accurately stated, "we will outlive you."pic.twitter.com/Sibm9sHUCD
968263723587657729 2018-02-26 23:17:15 UTC <HaroldALogan> @PoliticalEmilia Congratulations with having more class and/or grace and/or willpower than I do: I often find out hard to refrain from concluding such statements with "and by the way, I shouldn't have to explain this to you."
968115014669426688 2018-02-26 13:26:20 UTC <HaroldALogan> @pattonoswalt Ironically enough, that's a challenge some of us have on the left. I do voter registration drivers but not many teenagers (FL does preregistration at 16) want to talk to a 40-year old with a clipboard.
968111676846493698 2018-02-26 13:13:05 UTC <HaroldALogan> @PoliticalEmilia Stay awesome and don't accept an ounce of crap from my generation. We're the ones who let things get so bad on our watch.
967629725354135553 2018-02-24 05:17:58 UTC <HaroldALogan> I haven't seen this materialize yet at scale, but it's an interesting direction. https://getvoip.com/blog/2017/05/08/blockchain-and-voip/
967628628170190848 2018-02-24 05:13:37 UTC <HaroldALogan> @AndrewGillum @JoeforFlorida14 I agree that children should be able to enjoy their youth and do dumb teenager stuff like we did at their age. Sadly our generation's ineptitude has taken that away from them. And shame on you for dismissing them when they're the actual adults in the room.
