930802825562673155 2017-11-15 14:21:01 UTC <HMason9> @theboyonthebike Ok preach.
930586242147868672 2017-11-14 00:00:24 UTC <HMason9> Well, I told my 9:30 class today its bullshit if you call yourself a Christian but cant say black lives matter. I also said if you have black friends yet have failed at acknowledging systemic racism or police brutality, thats bullshit too.
930198472128696320 2017-11-13 22:19:32 UTC <HMason9> @PodSaveAmerica Okay, Im lying. Everyone told me to tune in, but now that I am: I AM SHOOK.
930198375672242176 2017-11-13 22:19:09 UTC <HMason9> SO NO ONE WAS GONNA TELL ME TO LISTEN TO @PodSaveAmerica?!
930150685995421696 2017-11-13 19:09:39 UTC <HMason9> Im just trying to meet @angela_rye and @Bakari_Sellers to have a talk. I love them both so much!

929598658584154113 2017-11-11 06:36:05 UTC <HMason9> Black people can say the n word, and white people dont decide whether we can or not. This word was created to oppress black people BY white people, so you dont all of sudden get to flip the script and think that no one should be able to say it. Thats not how this works.
929563678147522561 2017-11-11 04:17:05 UTC <HMason9> @blahblahbln Imma be sleep when you ask me to take out my badass nephew too.

924831030988730368 2017-10-29 02:51:14 UTC <HMason9> The only time thousands of white people cheer for a black kid to win is in a stadium.
924780085726588928 2017-10-29 23:28:48 UTC <HMason9> The highlight of college has been having Jeri and Cj as roommates. When I tell y'all, they ALWAYS keep me laughing

923381691703611392 2017-10-25 02:52:05 UTC <HMason9> My woke Wednesday is on Facebook now! I talked about sexual assault/violence towards women and shared my own story about it. I also highlighted how not to be an offensive idiot through your Halloween costume.
922999289290268672 2017-10-24 01:32:33 UTC <HMason9> @ijenma_ @_DearJune Come to the library
922226847466868736 2017-10-22 22:23:09 UTC <HMason9> The burden of the brutalized is not to comfort the bystander. If you have no interest in equal rights for black people then do not make suggestions for those who do.
922122984160194560 2017-10-22 15:30:26 UTC <HMason9> 605 people viewed my Woke Wednesday featuring my two friends talking about Islam and what it's like to be Muslim in America which means 605 people are more educated on a topic most will never take the time to learn about.
921940188103929857 2017-10-21 03:24:04 UTC <HMason9> @YayaPapayaa You should!! They did my big chop, and when I tell you, my curls NEVER curled up the way they did before the girl worked her magic. I was honestly shook

920477362206199808 2017-10-17 02:31:19 UTC <HMason9> I'm not impressed with this playlist. #TheWopsters
920324741256314880 2017-10-17 16:24:51 UTC <HMason9> White Christians need a wake up call in how they've consistently contributed to a system that has dismantled and destroyed people's lives. Moreover, they need to be aware of how many of their theologies and doctrines have been misconstrued to support hate and bigotry.

917542584666423296 2017-10-09 00:09:33 UTC <HMason9> Y'all are so quick to believe Colin Kapernick is disrespecting the troops by kneeling but don't even know that the idea of kneeling was suggested to him by a white army vet.
917539665451864066 2017-10-09 23:57:57 UTC <HMason9> @espn shame on y'all for suspending @jemelehill. History will remember y'all for being on the WRONG side.

916145625158340608 2017-10-05 03:38:32 UTC <HMason9> LOL, I said on my woke Wednesday that you're more likely to be killed by a white person than a brown one. I'm interested what the good people of Dublin, GA have to say about that.
916124523853991936 2017-10-05 02:14:41 UTC <HMason9> I honestly have to put Christiana and Jeri in rice at least once a week

915800267198799873 2017-10-04 04:46:13 UTC <HMason9> I'm writing a paper for my reformation theology class, and I managed to talk about white supremacy. Who is really surprised though?
915795210063552518 2017-10-04 04:26:07 UTC <HMason9> @CharterNewsroom my wifi has been out for almost a week and yall said twice someone would be out to fix it, and no one has came. Do y'all have reparations for this inconvenience?
915783328967663616 2017-10-04 03:38:54 UTC <HMason9> @blahblahbln  that's really how me and booker interact with each other

915415512955449344 2017-10-03 03:17:20 UTC <HMason9> There's nowhere I could run. There's no where I could hide where You won't find me, Lord.
915327529073958912 2017-10-03 21:27:43 UTC <HMason9> I taught one of my students who speaks VERY little English how to add and subtract negatives, and I've never felt so accomplished in my short teaching career.
915301210638471168 2017-10-03 19:43:08 UTC <HMason9> I AM SO SICK OF YALL DEFENDING DONALD TRUMP.

914999233811501056 2017-10-02 23:43:11 UTC <HMason9> @alishamcook OKAY MA'AM! Proud of you

914836714887303168 2017-10-02 12:57:24 UTC <HMason9> @BrianRoss @ABC @GrowTheFuckUp66 @SchizoChris Quran* I'm definitely not about to give life to anyone who can't even speak the name to the text correctly.
914833084037701632 2017-10-02 12:42:58 UTC <HMason9> @BrianRoss @ABC @GrowTheFuckUp66 @SchizoChris Islam isn't terrorism. It's a peaceful religion that has been misconstrued IMMENSELY by the media and uneducated people to be portrayed as something it's not.
914829792482086915 2017-10-02 12:29:53 UTC <HMason9> @BrianRoss @ABC @GrowTheFuckUp66 HE KILLED OVER 50 PEOPLE AND INJURED 200. It's common sense. If this was a brown person with a hijab, they would've been called a terrorist immediately
914827745468796928 2017-10-02 12:21:45 UTC <HMason9> @BrianRoss @ABC Y'all get on my nerves. You love trying to normalize white terrorists.

913465675041079296 2017-09-28 18:09:22 UTC <HMason9> To be honest, I think it's a fairly asinine and conceited belief to think that anyone not a Christian isn't deemed as good.
913420169631944704 2017-09-28 15:08:33 UTC <HMason9> Why do I have to overthink EVERYTHING?
913418629160554496 2017-09-28 15:02:26 UTC <HMason9> I'm so ready to be in Nashville next weekend.

731148008386134016 2016-05-13 15:44:03 UTC <HMason9> My best friend is graduating today, and I'm not ready at all  @Ben_Lanier
730990216127913984 2016-05-12 05:17:03 UTC <HMason9> The issue in being the one who always gets hurt is rationality takes the backseat in driving your decision making.
730989830805557248 2016-05-12 05:15:31 UTC <HMason9> You may not be able to control how you feel, but you do have control over how you allow yourself to be treated.
730988895463190528 2016-05-12 05:11:48 UTC <HMason9> wanted to remind some people and myself too lol
730987049369669632 2016-05-12 05:04:28 UTC <HMason9> Some people, no matter how much we are drawn to them, are not worth that sacrifice.
730986259150147584 2016-05-12 05:01:19 UTC <HMason9> There's a difference between someone who treats you like a priority and someone who treats you as an option.
730985830223884289 2016-05-12 04:59:37 UTC <HMason9> As much as we'd like to believe people would change for us, they, realistically, never will.
730985567568207872 2016-05-12 04:58:35 UTC <HMason9> You do have control over how you allow yourself to be treated.
730964909576626176 2016-05-12 03:36:29 UTC <HMason9> @RyanSeacrest I'm trying to meet you tomorrow to be honest, so how do I make this happen?? #UGA16

730614161185640448 2016-05-11 04:22:44 UTC <HMason9> @cuffsaddy oh most definitely 
730613995858722816 2016-05-11 04:22:05 UTC <HMason9> @CharterCom are y'all finished or are y'all done?
730605899920879619 2016-05-11 03:49:55 UTC <HMason9> @Ben_Lanier my child will know to take it to me and he will be given excess toys in return for his silence https://twitter.com/1blxckswan/status/649678110611349504
730602993092050944 2016-05-11 03:38:22 UTC <HMason9> And if you feel like you can't vent or talk to your friends about it any longer, you've got me because I've been there.
730602845918113792 2016-05-11 03:37:47 UTC <HMason9> Y'all don't let people look down on you because it takes you a long time to move and fully heal from a heartbreak.
730602268920270848 2016-05-11 03:35:29 UTC <HMason9> Now I'm in my feelings, so I just need to go to sleep 
730601509566730240 2016-05-11 03:32:28 UTC <HMason9> !!!!! https://twitter.com/krisfulthinking/status/730601397444608000
730601471151067136 2016-05-11 03:32:19 UTC <HMason9> In all seriousness, heartbreak is the worst. Especially because it always comes from people you never expect it to come from.
730601228518952960 2016-05-11 03:31:21 UTC <HMason9> @CharterCom y'all playing with my data right now, and I will nicely send my phone bill if need be
730601090006323200 2016-05-11 03:30:48 UTC <HMason9> how it go out nationwide?! Someone cut that many cords??
730600859256684544 2016-05-11 03:29:53 UTC <HMason9> @CharterCom why my internet not working?

713007300248776705 2016-03-24 14:19:22 UTC <HMason9> He was in my English class. He's so nice!!https://twitter.com/redandblack/status/712991875016167424
712655216676573184 2016-03-23 15:00:18 UTC <HMason9> I'm so over people saying they struggled on a test and see they got a 95 on it. Meanwhile, I'm sitting here with a 71.
712642490919219200 2016-03-23 14:09:44 UTC <HMason9> @esalimonu my girl!!! So proud of you 
712641475574628354 2016-03-23 14:05:42 UTC <HMason9> @IRIAsistable_ most definitely
712641435342868480 2016-03-23 14:05:33 UTC <HMason9> I like when professors from old classes remember me and stop to ask how I'm doing.
712640924518629378 2016-03-23 14:03:31 UTC <HMason9> @IRIAsistable_ you're right, but she stopped herself from saying it when she saw I was behind her
712640054460551168 2016-03-23 14:00:03 UTC <HMason9> After class, the white girl in front of me was about to give her opinion to her friends, & I just looked at her & she stopped herself.
712639667427000320 2016-03-23 13:58:31 UTC <HMason9> We talked about Emmett Till today in History class...
712435676617318400 2016-03-22 00:27:56 UTC <HMason9> People call me anti and ghost, but never ask to hangout with me

708494024445968384 2016-03-11 03:25:13 UTC <HMason9> I wish I was the president. I need people following me and protecting me 24/7. I am important.
708491298504908800 2016-03-11 03:14:23 UTC <HMason9> If people knew how much I go to the movies, restaurants, etc, alone...they would think something is seriously wrong with me.
708482176824819712 2016-03-11 02:38:08 UTC <HMason9> Considering going to see another movie 
708478053492658177 2016-03-11 02:21:45 UTC <HMason9> We here. We been here. And we ain't going anywhere.
708477998266236928 2016-03-11 02:21:32 UTC <HMason9> Y'all aren't going to silence people of color.
708476178760343552 2016-03-11 02:14:18 UTC <HMason9> The Perfect Match was terrible.
708476031896854528 2016-03-11 02:13:43 UTC <HMason9> @Ben_Lanier you know America will not let those negro thugs have a voice!!
708467603967234048 2016-03-11 01:40:14 UTC <HMason9> "Lie to your girl. Not me." WHY IS THE PERFECT MATCH PREACHING?!
