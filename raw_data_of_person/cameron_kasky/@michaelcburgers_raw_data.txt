952949506517143558 2018-01-15 17:04:01 UTC <michaelcburgers> @michaelcburgess Political unity and discourse. Today's modern Republican is as nasty as any politician in history.  Your party is a discrage to our civil union.
952949100743479296 2018-01-15 17:02:25 UTC <michaelcburgers> @michaelcburgess Smart socialism. King called for universal health care and education, guaranteed national income and nationalizing some industries.
952948817875357696 2018-01-15 17:01:17 UTC <michaelcburgers> @michaelcburgess Shall we discuss some of Dr. King's ideals that you are active fighting against Mike? How about...  The environment.   MLK was a huge proponent of interconnected environmental policy long before it was cool...
