Anecdotally though, Ive heard similar logic (theyre all evil; doesnt matter who we vote for) parroted by people I couldnt get to bother to vote last election.   HRC was a politician, so was just as bad as a racist imbecile. And there were MANY such people.
952577955213004800 2018-01-14 16:27:37 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @JeffreyGuterman I understand the point being made but I think doesnt matter who you vote for because system is rigged is a dangerous sentiment for nuance-challenged Twitter.    2016 showed us it matters very much, and the all politicians are evil narrative is itself a threat to democracy.

938535769869901825 2017-12-06 22:28:59 UTC <Rubygirl123456> It's not about convenience. It's about hypocrisy. Where is the hashtag #TrumpResign being tweeted from the lauded Capitol? Or Farenthold?

Let's say he touched ass during photos,  I DON'T actually believe it because I've know MANY women to flatter themselves imagining such things.   But EVEN IF true: 1-it's not an abuse of POWER 2-it may have been innocent 3-he's asked for an investigation ON HIMSELF

938513363130306560 2017-12-06 20:59:57 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @SenSanders @Authoroux @FLAVA_BLAZE Leftist politicians capitalizing on the poor judgement of an ex-comedian, as a means to APPEAR to "hold accountable" real predators  with far worse behavior with no remorse or sense of shame, doesn't make me happy.   It makes me nauseous.   And probably a registered independent.
938512753182105604 2017-12-06 20:57:31 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @SenSanders @Authoroux @FLAVA_BLAZE You probably meant accused. And you can tell from my statements I'm not the least bit happy.

Franken showed weakness by asking for an investigation and they pounced-to earn cheap political points. Judging by the commentary, I think it's gonna backfire.

938176335473672196 2017-12-05 22:40:43 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @JeffFlake Symbolic? Yes. And I applaud the symbolism.   So far, this is the only R w/a seat to lose who's willing to say being a PEDOPHILE is more of a threat than being a DEMOCRAT.  Don't like the tax bill vote, but he's one of few in the GOP who seems able to draw the line at PEDOPHILE.

Given the state of moral decay in the REAL White House, I'm pretty much out of time to  waste on a dude who is compelled to hate-tweet about a tv show president.   It's clear where you're coming from.

But since u seem so outraged, pls point me to  tweets where u have a problem w/Frank's character being president.

But, largely, it's this simple.

933174674153975808 2017-11-21 03:25:54 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @WhiskeyPolitics Agreed. I feel that's the sentiment behind the tweet you RT'd. So what approach would "work"? Bc I don't think it's a matter of the Left's "presentation".  A recent study found ppl w/incorrect facts cling more tightly to those "facts" when confronted w/corrective info. #screwed

842394661918507012 2017-03-16 15:18:32 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @Rubygirl123456 the "winners" (rich ppl) will LOVE him for signing it. & they're the ONLY opinions that matter 2 him. Bc poor ppl are losers
842394282761809920 2017-03-16 15:17:02 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @Rubygirl123456 He will sign it and they KNOW it. Because the minute he stops being useful, they WILL stand behind President Pence.
842393929655943168 2017-03-16 15:15:38 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @Rubygirl123456 Trump is their "useful idiot" here. He will do anything for a "win". Including sell you out. Dont listen 2 his words. Watch!
842393482299887617 2017-03-16 15:13:51 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @Rubygirl123456 #GOP has NEVER worked for the "average" Trump voter. They don't work 4U. This bill is for the rich they DO work for.
842392855423389696 2017-03-16 15:11:22 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @Rubygirl123456 either Trump doesn't understand what's going on, or he's using the term "negotiate" & hoping his voters don't understand it
842392411787694080 2017-03-16 15:09:36 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @Rubygirl123456 he WILL sign a bill that harms his voters & helps the rich. He is their rubber stamp now. Bc they hold pwr 2 impeach him
842391864179363841 2017-03-16 15:07:25 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @Rubygirl123456 Trump isn't going to "negotiate" it into an ideologically opposite bill. They won't let him, & there's no evidence he wants2
842391502257029121 2017-03-16 15:05:59 UTC <Rubygirl123456> Trump voters, pls understand, the horror of the bill is not an "accident" or a "jumping off point". It's what they've been trying for YEARS.https://twitter.com/zackford/status/842181198680096768

842390184184414208 2017-03-16 15:00:45 UTC <Rubygirl123456> The priority of this bill is CLEAR. It's a tax break for rich. It's the opposite of why ppl voted 4 him. "Negotiation" isn't changing that.https://twitter.com/zackford/status/842181198680096768
842389545287004160 2017-03-16 14:58:13 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @POTUS This isnt "negotiating". This bill helps the wealthy who own congress.The ONLY person who doesn't get that is @potus. Or he does &he's lyinghttps://twitter.com/zackford/status/842181198680096768

839125556524384256 2017-03-07 14:48:17 UTC <Rubygirl123456> Well, that's a load off my mind. Relax, the WH is super friendly. Like a high-school clique. #maga #trumpcare #trumprussia #flint #NKoreahttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/839116941956640768
839123574598270976 2017-03-07 14:40:25 UTC <Rubygirl123456> Thank God there was time to include tax cuts for rich, planned parenthood exclusion, & skyrocketing elderly premiums. Close one.  #trumpcarehttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/839108868584124417

839122532624125952 2017-03-07 14:36:16 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Take ur time. No rush. Thank God there was time to squeeze tax cuts for the rich in, though. Whew, close one
839109120091389953 2017-03-07 13:42:58 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @GOP @axios @GeeOhPees2 was Colorado the Town Hall where they held up ID's to prove they were not "paid outsiders"?
839108221545689088 2017-03-07 13:39:24 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @GOP @axios @GeeOhPees2 I would be too, if he stays that way. Disagreeing on politics is one thing, but u can't sell out ur ppl for ur party
839105588311244800 2017-03-07 13:28:56 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @GOP @axios @GeeOhPees2 it'd be nice if they actually were more afraid of voters than Heath Insurance Co. lobbyists. We'll see, I guess.
839105376700231681 2017-03-07 13:28:06 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @GOP @TylerBlackwell4 @GeeOhPees2 I applaud ur optimism.The very fact they floated this abortion, should show EVERYONE their level of hubris
839105089876987904 2017-03-07 13:26:57 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @GOP @TylerBlackwell4 @GeeOhPees2 Nope. But @gop voted last week AGAINST investigating, while @jasoninthehouse calls 4 investigating leak source
839104323439198208 2017-03-07 13:23:55 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @axios @GeeOhPees2 I'll believe it when I see it. All I've seen so far are spineless @GOP attributing voter "outrage" to paid agitators
839104062024974336 2017-03-07 13:22:52 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @GOP @TylerBlackwell4 @GeeOhPees2 Sure. They were sketchy on some cabinet noms too, until DJT & Ryan snapped the whip & they scuttled back
839103731367030784 2017-03-07 13:21:34 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @GOP @GeeOhPees2 @TylerBlackwell4 most voters want an independent investigation into Russia. How's that going?

838962213251596288 2017-03-06 03:59:13 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @GPSloan_149 They. Do not. B/c reading is hard, I suppose. Or it's just wishful thinking...I really don't know anymore.

838960016426221568 2017-03-06 03:50:29 UTC <Rubygirl123456> So..Trump poses w/coal miners in the Oval, promising to put them back in the mines, just weeks b4 gutting ACA black lung coverage?#Trumpcare
838959357291278336 2017-03-06 03:47:52 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @GPSloan_149 ACA changed a law that was allowing carriers to deny black lung claims in almost all cases. They will return 2 being uncovered
838958763864428544 2017-03-06 03:45:31 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @arjtrimm might as well have ended the sentence after the word think. Guess it's easier to gamble than LEARN WHAT THE LAW DOES

838957485415247872 2017-03-06 03:40:26 UTC <Rubygirl123456> It's cowardly and it's theft. Will be tantamount to murder, for some. It's dereliction of duty. It's criminal. #Trumpcarehttps://twitter.com/txblackdemocrat/status/838954523137822720
838957143667662848 2017-03-06 03:39:04 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @stevej132 if you go 63 days w/o coverage, say bc U lose a job or can't afford, carriers can charge you 30% surcharge. (That means MORE $$)
838956610881990658 2017-03-06 03:36:57 UTC <Rubygirl123456> @GeeOhPees2 They'll get the votes. Voters need to make @GOP more afraid of losing a seat than they are of their colleagues' scare tactics
