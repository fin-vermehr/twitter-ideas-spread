935258704244625408 2017-11-27 21:27:06 UTC <GhoulieBits> Sometimes I wish I could get sports news instead of sports opinion.... I dont care what you thought about that last play of the game, but if you must could u at least give me a replay or play by play? some of us have jobs that arent watching sports for a living.. Thanks!
