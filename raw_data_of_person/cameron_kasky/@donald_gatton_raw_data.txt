968639887992938496 2018-02-27 00:12:00 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman @ThomasGFinchio Right to work laws hurts Americans more. Vote no on republicans right to work laws. By the way US citizens work for cash money too. I would keep every immigrant, over trump and the republicans in Congress.

966831063287980032 2018-02-22 00:24:22 UTC <donald_gatton> @Education4Libs Fed money does not go to murdering babies. But taking healthcare away is murdering people including babies.
966818121947471873 2018-02-22 23:32:57 UTC <donald_gatton> Would the 2nd amendment let me have a tank fully arm? If not why?
966800461755011077 2018-02-22 22:22:47 UTC <donald_gatton> @BitchesAlice I see you keep retweet lies.

966739047115829250 2018-02-22 18:18:44 UTC <donald_gatton> @andyhards Don't do this with bowie knives, like we did. Young and dumb.
966729529829003266 2018-02-22 17:40:55 UTC <donald_gatton> @Meredith_Goerli @andyhards Close, mostly getting bruised a lot. Getting ran into by a deer was worse then ever getting tackled in football.
966724426183176192 2018-02-22 17:20:38 UTC <donald_gatton> @Meredith_Goerli I made my own traps for rabbis and with friends (when young) try to get deer my running it down.
966723827848839174 2018-02-22 17:18:16 UTC <donald_gatton> @Meredith_Goerli I have read a little about them, they seem to lie and twisted things around. I don't own a gun my self, my father was a hunter, he only killed what he would or we would eat. He was a great shot, rabbits would only be hit in the head. I never found it to be fair to shot a animal.
966717418453307392 2018-02-22 16:52:47 UTC <donald_gatton> @nowthisnews @armysarge84 They had a buy back policy with that I believe.
966708966154743808 2018-02-22 16:19:12 UTC <donald_gatton> @Meredith_Goerli Do you mean gulf of Alaska? Gun owners of America?
966705200600961025 2018-02-22 16:04:14 UTC <donald_gatton> @JoyAnnReid @MatthewTBright I believe you should know your enemy and get the truth out. You have to get their sheep to see the truth. When I was watching, it reminded me of when I read joseph goebbles propaganda writings.
966698829797101568 2018-02-22 15:38:56 UTC <donald_gatton> Watching the NRA propaganda machine at work, biggest bunch of BS since I read joseph goebbels propaganda writings.
966520344436756482 2018-02-21 03:49:41 UTC <donald_gatton> @FDRLST @dm1299 @DevinNunes @TrumpChess Then they could call us little russia, we could go around clicking our heals saying heil trump.

966464345902403585 2018-02-21 00:07:10 UTC <donald_gatton> @Meredith_Goerli Yes, have very few photos this was taken by my wife. When I am done with something I like to deliver and get my money. Thank you do very nice work too. We must both like metal.
966457663239475200 2018-02-21 23:40:37 UTC <donald_gatton> @Meredith_Goerli Very Nice. I work with copper sheet metal and some blacksmithing.pic.twitter.com/hhQcVjgtqR
966451310630449154 2018-02-21 23:15:22 UTC <donald_gatton> @Meredith_Goerli Nothing to due with guns, just wondering if you have any photos of your work?

966446154551578624 2018-02-21 22:54:53 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenFeinstein @BarryBahrami I guess you just can't be a man with out one of these guns? Try a musket. You could have all the guns you like, like those made in 1776 as far as I'm concern.
966443063261499393 2018-02-21 22:42:36 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenFeinstein @Meredith_Goerli You missed the first part. When you leave the military they don't let you take your guns home. Have no problems with hunters but don't see a need for these kind of guns.
966440024844664832 2018-02-21 22:30:32 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenFeinstein @thalassophobiia I believe if you look at other countries around the world that ban guns like the AR-15s it made a big difference.
966436441361453057 2018-02-21 22:16:17 UTC <donald_gatton> Mr. Revish when you told about trump telling the JD to make changes in some gun laws, would that stand up in court? Wouldn't that have to be done by the Congress?  Thank you.@Jerry10TV

We will get the republicans out and get a single payer healthcare for all. The kool-aid thing makes me think you have a love of putin.

There was things that need fix for upper middle class on cost. It was the best plan this country had.

966353169193361414 2018-02-21 16:45:24 UTC <donald_gatton> @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @RTarno63 I think 2 amendment should be enforced, every man and woman with a gun should be called up to train and go over seas to fight.

966350623141744641 2018-02-21 16:35:17 UTC <donald_gatton> @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @deplorable1950 When you have "good citizens" buying 100 of guns at a time, like in COLUMBUS, OHIO and selling on the streets of Chicago doesn't help. Gun laws would help.
966349063309361154 2018-02-21 16:29:05 UTC <donald_gatton> @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @JET4AMERICANS President Obama fixed the economy. President Obama made healthcare available to more people at a lower cost, that cover everything. He wanted gun control but you need Congress. He did make it harder for the mentality ill to get guns, trump made it easier. #CadetBoneSpurs

The cost started to raise faster every time Rs tried to get rid of it. Now they gutted it & cost going up & coverage going down. Maybe you had a company give you healthcare insurance. Be for ACA cost was very high paid little.
964226188838359040 2018-02-15 19:53:32 UTC <donald_gatton> @NRA @WalshFreedom @imaboltsfan Well these same republicans have taken care of that, they killing healthcare. In Columbus, Ohio they let guns stores sell 100s of guns to one person so they sell them on the streets. DON'T you think laws should stop one person buying hundreds of the same guns.
964207069388619776 2018-02-15 18:37:34 UTC <donald_gatton> @NRA @igorvolsky If paul ryan doesn't want to pass gun laws, then he should let people bring guns into the capital building, Whitehouse, state capitals and courtrooms. See if it would change then.

Just Nazi BS put out by Russia, used by American Nazis. A GOOD NAZIS IS A DEAD NAZI a quote from my father and my belief.
963248387402452993 2018-02-12 03:08:06 UTC <donald_gatton> @JoyAnnReid @ZerlinaMaxwell @Progrssive4lyfe I believe that President Obama would have push for single-payer healthcare for all but new at the time you will never get it through. He did get ACA  even when the Dems new it would cost elections. Because of ACA we may move on to single payer.

958448055476420609 2018-01-30 21:13:18 UTC <donald_gatton> @SpeakerRyan @ThePlumLineGS My question is who will stop them once they take complete control of justice department? Seams like we will have to take it back ourselves.
958446194061139968 2018-01-30 21:05:54 UTC <donald_gatton> @MotherBear86 Just really haven't seen anything where he has taken a strong stand against trump and his comrades. Voting for Senator Brown don't like putin's republicans.
958442150009753601 2018-01-30 20:49:50 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenSherrodBrown @MotherBear86 Thank you MotherBear86
958394999326085122 2018-01-30 17:42:28 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenSherrodBrown What are you doing to stand up against trump and the republicans turning this country into a dictatorship?
958378423717687296 2018-01-30 16:36:36 UTC <donald_gatton> @DerekCressman She is no better than the rest of the republicans, she filled her pockets with tax scam. She hasn't called out trump.
958371240842022912 2018-01-30 16:08:04 UTC <donald_gatton> @marcorubio rubio, trump and the republicans would be the first to nail CHRIST to the cross.

Have you seen a illegal used welfare, or did you see someone who looks different they you. I seen people like you yelling at natives Americans telling them to go home. Have you every hear of CHRIST
958361645310410752 2018-01-30 15:29:56 UTC <donald_gatton> @Katieb46 The only traitors are trump and his republicans comrades. If you like them so much you would love living in Russia. Bye
958180486026850304 2018-01-29 03:30:04 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman @ebecker33444 portman love putin as much as trump the Republicans NAZIS party have all received money from him. He should step down down and go live in Russia.
958160537489235969 2018-01-29 02:10:48 UTC <donald_gatton> @RepAdamSchiff @tedlieu @g_money1216 trump is a traitor and breaks the law every day. Republicans on the committee break their rules. #ReleaseTheDemMemo
958159049345912832 2018-01-29 02:04:53 UTC <donald_gatton> @tedlieu You should release the Democratic memo and tell the Republicans NAZIS to go to hell. #ReleaseTheDemMemo
958151254965936128 2018-01-29 01:33:55 UTC <donald_gatton> @saabelieves @DalaiLama To much patience could lead to a government like putin's or hitler's, how many capitalist said they could control hitler. With 2 branches of government control by Nazis and a third branch they are trying to destroy.
958135168778334214 2018-01-29 00:30:00 UTC <donald_gatton> trump is in putin's pockets so deep he is selling out this country. They said no more sanctions. Why, did they find a way to stop them? Have they even try to keep the Russians from interfering? Has anyone cheek our voting machines? REPUBLICANS NAZI PARTY
958127858915954688 2018-01-29 00:00:57 UTC <donald_gatton> @MSNBC Republicans NAZI party on the move.
958119753398259712 2018-01-29 23:28:44 UTC <donald_gatton> TELL ME NOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT THE AMERICAN NAZI PARTY!!! THEY CONTROL TWO BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT NOE DESTROYING THE THIRD. I WILL BE SURPRISED IF WE HAVE FAIR MIDTERM ELECTIONS.
958109846611644420 2018-01-29 22:49:22 UTC <donald_gatton> @DDJONES36255609 Right, they talk BS take away healthcare for mothers, kids anyone else. I would say these pro-lifers have no God but I have friends that don't believe and are better than a lot of believers I know.
958106973958033409 2018-01-29 22:37:58 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenSherrodBrown @costumer85 He could change it. To think he is not able to do that is deceiving you self. He also could have did it before he took office. trump is for trump and what ever he can do for putin. He is out to destroy this republic with the help of the Republicans in Congress.
958071228706762756 2018-01-29 20:15:55 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenSherrodBrown @costumer85 trump policy make his stuff outside this country and brings his workers in from outside this country.
958069967118831616 2018-01-29 20:10:54 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenSherrodBrown Don't get me wrong but why are these laws written with loop holes in them?

I have never seen a DACA or illegals on food stamps or welfare. I have seen a lot of Wal-Mart employees on government assistance because their pay was so low. Give trump a citizenship test.
957818631706103808 2018-01-28 03:32:11 UTC <donald_gatton> @GovMikeHuckabee She most likely in deep prayer for the country to be saved from trump and the republicans.

957697601700319232 2018-01-28 19:31:16 UTC <donald_gatton> @EdKrassen He will talk to putin to see what he can do, just like he did when he launched the missiles at Syria air base.
957644888723640320 2018-01-28 16:01:48 UTC <donald_gatton> @thedailybeast This is what trump wants here, like is master putin has in Russia.

957393476412432390 2018-01-27 23:22:46 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman Why have you supported trump than? Why did you approve his cabinet then? Why do you support kicking out people who just want to make a better life here because it's not safe where they came from. Why do you support these Nazis trying to destroy our country? MONEY!
957306722695176194 2018-01-27 17:38:03 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenMarkey All the Republicans in trump cabinet and most of the ones in Congress need to goto jail, trump needs to be held for treason.

957023976848576512 2018-01-26 22:54:31 UTC <donald_gatton> @JoanieMarie11 Would rather be a friend of President Obama than traitor trump. You might have forgotten that republicans cut money from the state department that would have provided more security. Being a believer in Christ I like to help all people. Don't forget Las Vegas.
956993642383671298 2018-01-26 20:53:59 UTC <donald_gatton> @krassenstein @JasonArgonaut7 If you really look at the history of the parties the republicans and democrats switched. Southern democrats become republicans.

956564773935644673 2018-01-25 16:29:48 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman I bet the police and fire departments love your tax cut, now they can't take off their uniforms and equipment they have to buy.
956558427068747776 2018-01-25 16:04:35 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman Like you care, is that why you take away healthcare and give money to the rich?
956349914681958405 2018-01-24 02:16:02 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenatorCarper @senrobportman portman, how much money are the Russians paying you? It is obvious that a whole lot of republicans are getting money from Russia to keep trump and pence in office.
956337768329895936 2018-01-24 01:27:46 UTC <donald_gatton> @China6603 Read a book socialism was the name but they didn't practice it. Just like a tax cut may be said to be for the middle class but the money goes to the rich. Read the rise and fall of the third Reich. A good starting place.
956298283428843520 2018-01-24 22:50:52 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman You have done all you could to kill healthcare

956185568152571904 2018-01-24 15:22:59 UTC <donald_gatton> @Ali_Gharib Sounds like something Jesus Christ would do. I guess we can't practice our religious beliefs in the United States Of America any more.

956171262598041603 2018-01-24 14:26:08 UTC <donald_gatton> @China6603 Bad, if you want to treat someone like you want to be treated is that bad, if you want healthcare for all is that bad, if you want all to be able to have a good education is that bad? If you think that is being a liberal than I am a liberal.
956169752900198401 2018-01-24 14:20:08 UTC <donald_gatton> @China6603 Conservatives want to destroy the justice department, to give the president unlimited power. Conservative want to check your I.D when your on the street, on a bus, going into a movie, is that what you our telling me a conservative is. If some wants to help another person out is
956166984126943233 2018-01-24 14:09:08 UTC <donald_gatton> @China6603 Just because the Nazis called them self socialist don't mean that they were. Read about the Nazis. There are a lot of good books about them. You think trump is a conservative? So you are telling me that they want to destroy the news media. Your telling me that
956164103776632832 2018-01-24 13:57:41 UTC <donald_gatton> @gary_revilla I wish you good luck in life, try going to a library sometime.

955970505248591873 2018-01-23 01:08:24 UTC <donald_gatton> @MattMackowiak trump should go to Mexico and stay there until they write out cheek.
955969533096923137 2018-01-23 01:04:32 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenSanders I would like that but it would have to be better than the Medicare we have now. I am on Medicare now when I had ACA it paid more.
955955733169868802 2018-01-23 00:09:42 UTC <donald_gatton> I have been very mad at the democrats for not keeping the government shutdown until they had the dreamers taking care of. I think I will believe senator Schumer knows what he is doing. I been getting emails that wants to punish Democrats, I want to get rid of republicans.
955945085102903296 2018-01-23 23:27:23 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman What you haven't stolen enough money from the working people and poor? Now you want to cut S.S., Medicare, Medicaid all of ACA. Thinking of some way to tax working for breathing?
955940509964435456 2018-01-23 23:09:12 UTC <donald_gatton> @gary_revilla Maybe you shouldn't have read something into it that wasn't there. Maybe you should read about how the Nazis took over. Before calling someone names look into a mirror. If we are giving advice try NPR or PBS. Do you have dreamers on you mind.
955938325952630785 2018-01-23 23:00:32 UTC <donald_gatton> @China6603 Best schools Columbus had. Like trump went to the best schools. I wouldn't give you two cents for my grammar, but my History I would bet the bank on.

Just like trump campaign was from Joseph Goebbels writings in the late 1920s, with the help of putin. trump is doing just like hitler did in his first two years. Do you think we should be worried???

955603917315899393 2018-01-22 00:51:42 UTC <donald_gatton> @PalmerReport So if democrats shut it down again won't they say the same things they have been against democrats? Then will the democrats be strong like those that voted for ACA and take a chance on getting voted out.
955602386822815744 2018-01-22 00:45:37 UTC <donald_gatton> @Phreaddie @PalmerReport I hope you are right, but will they get funding for health centers and money put back in for ACA?

955578449590210560 2018-01-22 23:10:30 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenGillibrand Thank you for voting no, hope that it is because you have a backbone unlike other democrats and not because you job is not in jeopardy.
955576653186519040 2018-01-22 23:03:22 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenSherrodBrown Mr. Brown you lost my vote. Looking for someone with a backbone to stand up against these republicans traitors. Hope democrats put some one up against you.

953376376089870337 2018-01-16 21:20:15 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman Comrade portman would first need a conscience and a believe in God.
953362668106256385 2018-01-16 20:25:47 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman Comrade portman doesn't want DACA or CHIP. He cares not for children that have been brought here or that live here where their parents are under paid and can't get healthcare. Comrade portman only cares about the rich & how much money he can put in his pockets and putin.
953360193819172865 2018-01-16 20:15:57 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman Comrade portman would never allow free people to ask him questions, like why are you giving all the money to the rich, why do you destroy the little health care we have, like how much did you get by destroying net neutrality. You can't work for people under putin rules.

953033267443326976 2018-01-15 22:36:52 UTC <donald_gatton> @MrFilmkritik I say I will try not to be a racist. My mom always told me to think about what you are saying before you say it. At times when I have been very mad I have spoken with out thinking and have always been sorry.

952685149434544129 2018-01-14 23:33:34 UTC <donald_gatton> @SamClark_23 That is 33,000 per student, at least he did something, what has trump done. About 20 years ago my son art college cost about 40,000 for four years.
952655881547677698 2018-01-14 21:37:16 UTC <donald_gatton> @ananavarro A racist would not have heard anything. The republicans in Congress all take their orders from putin. No DACA and CHIP then let the Republicans shut down the government, they are taking away everything away from the people anyway. Then come out and don't give them a min of peace.
952636172446175232 2018-01-14 20:18:57 UTC <donald_gatton> @MatthewNussbaum putin has given them his orders to defend trump.
952626463739727872 2018-01-14 19:40:22 UTC <donald_gatton> @kylegriffin1 A day late and a dollar short if you ask me. Has not stood up to trump very well in the past, filled his pockets from the tax cut. Brought shame on himself and family.
952578495904874498 2018-01-14 16:29:46 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenatorDurbin If the Republicans had any decency they would pass DACA with a 2/3 vote and trump could not stop it. So what makes republicans any better than trump.
951985562587680769 2018-01-12 01:13:39 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman If portman can't stand up to defend this country from a racist traitor, and the Republicans trying to cover up for trump treason, then he is part of the problem. I am sure someone once said look what a good thing hitler did that does not make him good.

951836487041110023 2018-01-12 15:21:17 UTC <donald_gatton> @ironstowe Has graham come out in public to denounce this racist traitor? When he does that on fox I might have some respect for him.

951823763364073474 2018-01-12 14:30:43 UTC <donald_gatton> Congress needs to pass a clean DACA NOW, that leads to citizenship. Pass the CHIP bill now. Any republicans that don't vote for these shows how racist and their connection to trump and putin.
951665650723942401 2018-01-11 04:02:26 UTC <donald_gatton> @joshgad trump and the republicans want to turn this country into a putin style government.
951652855978569728 2018-01-11 03:11:36 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman The reason why he has not responded to trump's racist remarks is because him and his team can't find anything wrong with them. He believes and does what trump tells him to do.
951649437268443138 2018-01-11 02:58:01 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman Any body that thinks portman is any better than trump are fooling themselves. portman, republicans in Congress and trump would love to make us like putin's Russia.

What is your stand on a constitutional convention that republicans our getting together to rewrite the constitution? Goodbye to freedom.
950118258161717256 2018-01-07 21:33:39 UTC <donald_gatton> @Nationwide @senrobportman @MrMoxieSox The GOP and portman only care about filling thier pockets even if they sell this country to putin. That is why they are getting a constitutional convention together to rewrite the constitution, say goodby to freedom.
950113266344263680 2018-01-07 21:13:49 UTC <donald_gatton> @Nationwide @senrobportman @myeucatastrophe His answer would have to be yes, because he has received putin's money to.

950093832695222274 2018-01-07 19:56:36 UTC <donald_gatton> Does everyone know about the Republicans constitutional convention they are getting together with their rich donors? They only need a few more states. If the get this do you think they won't be taking our freedoms away? This is very dangerous to us.
949761057710641159 2018-01-06 21:54:16 UTC <donald_gatton> @LindseyGrahamSC @EdKrassen graham would show it but first they have to find a way to remove putin name.

949711486993223682 2018-01-06 18:37:17 UTC <donald_gatton> @Ldydewood If the Republican house and Senate wasn't working for putin, trump would have been out before his first month was over.

949700378244911104 2018-01-06 17:53:09 UTC <donald_gatton> Did mcconnell say that moving the government right of center was a good thing? If the Republicans move any farther right we would have a government like putin's, that must be what they are trying to do.
949674773755330562 2018-01-06 16:11:24 UTC <donald_gatton> @adamcbest It is because he is working for putin, because putin has all his criminal activities he has done.
949673577808310273 2018-01-06 16:06:39 UTC <donald_gatton> Just thinking the Republicans have been after Hillary Clinton for over 16 years. Why do they hate her so much? Who else hates Hillary more? I think that would be putin. So how long have the Republicans been working for putin?
949664327698714625 2018-01-06 15:29:54 UTC <donald_gatton> @nana4MANY @MarkWarner Sir as a patriot give us all the information that went on behind closed doors that the Republicans traitors won't release. Thank you.

949653314450477056 2018-01-06 14:46:08 UTC <donald_gatton> @USArmy @SpeakerRyan You know you are some kind of math teacher, 5+5=5. Now tell us why you started taking money from the Russians, to become a traitor? Maybe you have always be a traitor to the people of this country. By the way what branch of the military were you in.
949650544364224512 2018-01-06 14:35:08 UTC <donald_gatton> @usairforce @SpeakerRyan That would be miss management by the Pentagon, not lack of money, maybe to many profiteers getting paid like trump's father did during WW2. So when did you first start taking money from putin? Why did you decide to become a traitor to this country?
949648135655129089 2018-01-06 14:25:33 UTC <donald_gatton> @WhiteHouse @SpeakerRyan You talk about rebuilding the military when it is bigger then most of the rest of the world. I just want to know why you took money from putin and when did you first started to work for putin?
949637520257699846 2018-01-06 13:43:22 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenSchumer @Jim_Jordan @Hermitjohn I don't capitalize names of traitors. At least it is one grade higher then trump.
949493234216177665 2018-01-05 04:10:02 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenBlumenthal @hardball When did republicans need evidence, they just keep saying the same lies over and over. Democrats should give the public all the information they have and tell the TRAITORS to go to Russia and live with their leader.
949487792073175041 2018-01-05 03:48:24 UTC <donald_gatton> @tfel_tla @BillKristol bannon is scrum but trump is worse if he makes money off of it he sell out this country to the anyone. How much did putin pay for destroying the state department and doing his best to break up our allies.
949486198946516992 2018-01-05 03:42:05 UTC <donald_gatton> A tip for the FBI, THEIR ARE TRAITORS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE. HELP US NOW YOU WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT THE POLITICIANS.
949480936277774338 2018-01-05 03:21:10 UTC <donald_gatton> @exoticgamora And pry for free and fair elections.
949470632210821120 2018-01-05 02:40:13 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman It is a good thing that republican Congress don't believe in God, because who else would even think about forgiveness for them.
949468514737381376 2018-01-05 02:31:48 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenSanders Do you think the Republicans will allow free elections? They have destroy the investigation in Congress, they will get rid of Bob Mueller. They will turn this country into a dictatorship if they are not stop before the end of the year.
949457382819713024 2018-01-05 01:47:34 UTC <donald_gatton> @theharryshearer I think it took about two years, useing hate, getting rid of the press, taking control of justice system and secret police. Too simplify it the best that I can.
949436043937435648 2018-01-05 00:22:47 UTC <donald_gatton> @exoticgamora pence is just as much a traitor as trump.
949435243815161863 2018-01-05 00:19:36 UTC <donald_gatton> @SykesCharlie @hardball Unless the Republicans try to get rid of the first amendment by 51 votes.
949432742403608578 2018-01-05 00:09:40 UTC <donald_gatton> @krassenstein I wonder how much she cost him to get.
949426309326868481 2018-01-05 23:44:06 UTC <donald_gatton> @funder Look what trump has done for putin in the world, treason is what he has done. He makes Benedict Arnold look like a great patriot.
949420773327998976 2018-01-05 23:22:06 UTC <donald_gatton> If grassley and graham can be recalled in there states the people should do it. They should be tried for treason. There can be no doubt that they are working for putin to cover up for trump. The FBI SHOULD BE INVESTIGATION ON THEM, IF THEY ARE NOT DOING ONE.
949413834019803141 2018-01-05 22:54:31 UTC <donald_gatton> @repblumenauer trump only lies any way.
949407918927110146 2018-01-05 22:31:01 UTC <donald_gatton> @RWPUSA From what I see you could lock up every Republican in Congress for treason and not go wrong.
949401020966326274 2018-01-05 22:03:37 UTC <donald_gatton> @Alvis180 @senrobportman What do you know of God? If you believed in Christ you would have taken money from the rich , to saved them and gave it to the poor, including the money you stuff in your pockets.
949399384411828224 2018-01-05 21:57:06 UTC <donald_gatton> @Alvis180 @senrobportman How much stock do you have in cardinal health? I hope their healthcare was free.  Where are your town halls? Traitor
949370776297332737 2018-01-05 20:03:26 UTC <donald_gatton> @JoyAnnReid We must know by now that the Republicans are working for putin. They want a government like putin's, dear leader getting a cut from all the minor players and them stealing all ther can. Tax plan shows this.
949358304622469120 2018-01-05 19:13:52 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman How much of a raise did they get? Will they be making over $80,000? Will they be getting free healthcare? Did they get their $1,000.00 tax free bonus. Tell us how much more money you are getting from your real estate. How much of a raise did you get? TRAITOR

949341304022011904 2018-01-05 18:06:19 UTC <donald_gatton> @tribelaw nunes is a traitor and most likely has ties to Russians. He is no patriot then I haven't seen any republicans in Congress that are patriots.
949327952789082117 2018-01-05 17:13:16 UTC <donald_gatton> @IronStache @DevinNunes @SpeakerRyan @JanzforCongress What did FBI say to ryan?
949080308338642945 2018-01-04 00:49:13 UTC <donald_gatton> @Jim_Jordan Did you forget to tell republicans first started the investigation Democrats continue but that is not what started the FBI investigation you know that, it came from inside trump circle. We all know you work for putin.
949077231841751040 2018-01-04 00:36:59 UTC <donald_gatton> @SenSchumer @Jim_Jordan You really know how to take things out of context. But we all know you work for putin.

Getting rid of the mandate will drive cost up higher. We need single payer healthcare for all. No insurance companies.
949062509750865921 2018-01-04 23:38:29 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman Maybe traitor you did not see the list of companies laying off like AT&T. In Ohio minimum wage has gone up.

949015282760212482 2018-01-04 20:30:49 UTC <donald_gatton> @IvankaTrump They have removed the protections that were put in place after the last crash, so when the rich manipulate the stocks again they can make more money while your 401k lose a lot of money.
949009691274809344 2018-01-04 20:08:36 UTC <donald_gatton> @ddale8 Why didn't they have a new vote on that race?

Giving putin secret information, treason not collusion. The list could on and on but I am going to bed, need to get up at 4:00
948304711534432256 2018-01-02 21:27:16 UTC <donald_gatton> @realDonaldTrump @tarastrong @Violine_Dreamer @nevaeh00701 I read news papers you can look in court documents and see where his father was convicted of war profiteering. It was on news reports when it happened. Having been a contractor I new people that have been cheated by trump. I don't know how old you are, I was living at the time.

His father was a crock too.
948278262802911233 2018-01-02 19:42:10 UTC <donald_gatton> @realDonaldTrump @tarastrong @nevaeh00701 The founding fathers who own slaves, who killed native Americans, even those that fought with us. I would not say they were Christian. They only gave the vote to white land owning males. They did wright some very good documents that we were getting close to living up to.
948273059944910848 2018-01-02 19:21:30 UTC <donald_gatton> @ROTBre @realDonaldTrump I hear nothing about the Russians standing up against putin from you, are you going to call on the UN to help the russian people?
948265447773949954 2018-01-02 18:51:15 UTC <donald_gatton> @realDonaldTrump @tarastrong @nevaeh00701 You can't have a greet country without new blood, new ideas and a love for freedom. The idea's of the 1930s Germany are not good. The idea's of 2016 putin are no good.

947964228580855808 2018-01-01 22:54:19 UTC <donald_gatton> @krassenstein I don't think news and fox goes together.

947526943783649280 2017-12-31 17:56:42 UTC <donald_gatton> @realDonaldTrump You are a traitor, you give this country to Putin, you give our money to yourself and the rich, while you steel, from the poor and middle class,  you are a Nazis supporter and my father who did fight in ww2 always said "the only good Nazis is a dead Nazis".
947261300069019649 2017-12-30 00:21:07 UTC <donald_gatton> @krassenstein I think that the GOP was using the information that the Russians took from the Democrats to help elect some of there people, like in Florida that Paul Ryan supported. They know that they were committing treason like trump.
947194018902966273 2017-12-30 19:53:46 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman I would like to get help to recall you and to elect a senator that looks out for working people and those that need help, not one filling his pockets and making the rich richer. Not to mention helping Russia and trump
947142812407074816 2017-12-30 16:30:18 UTC <donald_gatton> @senrobportman The buckeyes had a good win.

I think that you just filling you pockets and plotting with Russians.
