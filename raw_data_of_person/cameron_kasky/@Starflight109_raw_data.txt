971106073657708544 2018-03-06 19:31:44 UTC <Starflight109> @Breaking911 @jimcollins @LifeAsTheBoy @EazyWithIt @ev0loner He has moral boundaries. If all you see in a women is sex that is not respect. If all a women sees in a guy is sex that is not respect either. We need to help those who have been raped from both genders not encourage rape in this society.
971102402458849283 2018-03-06 19:17:09 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis @EliasWesteren If I must- courtney, kaiti, aj, libby, are all friends of mine that are gay, bi, pan etc. we get along just fine. Heck Courtney is right next to me as I speak. Being gay is a choice of respecting another of the same gender as a lover, instead of someone like a brother.
971101246760288256 2018-03-06 19:12:34 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis @EliasWesteren Yes my stance is opposite of yours. That is what causes debates and arguments in the first place. And OF COURSE all gay people disagree with me!!! THAT IS THE TOPIC WE ARE DISCUSSING!!!
971100795558092800 2018-03-06 19:10:46 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis @EliasWesteren nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. It even says it in the oldest known book written

Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves,

Id rather be myself and be able to speak my mind  and not have to be called a little bitch in the snowflake generation. Can I compliment another guy on his looks like girls do and not get called gay? Apparently not

969338378008322056 2018-03-01 22:27:33 UTC <Starflight109> @jackaverymusic @BecksMarie90 Notice how almost all of them have tweeted a corbyn comment recently. @corbynbesson are you hacking their twitter?

969336779168993281 2018-03-01 22:21:12 UTC <Starflight109> @d_m_elms @LifeNoggin @CunningSmi1e Im guessing that was sarcasm?
969293105877876742 2018-03-01 19:27:39 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis @EliasWesteren Hi, Starflight109s friend here. First off, he isnt telling Code Gaddis how to live their lives, he is simply stating that he has different opinions/views on the subject but is glad that Code Gaddis is comfortable and happy being himself. How in any way is that disrespectful?
969225396762894338 2018-03-01 14:58:36 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis @EliasWesteren Shall we continue this debate? I enjoy good debates and I am actually very interested in what you have to say in response. 
969050103624454144 2018-02-28 03:22:03 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis @EliasWesteren Btw, a debate is civil and prepared with facts and views. Not name calling. I dont want another useless internet argument. May we keep this respectful between us?
969049791534653441 2018-02-28 03:20:49 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis @EliasWesteren And saying if they would hate me is just as bad as saying that im telling people how to live their lives. In fact I think if we met, me and Codi could be friends! But the way you respect someone, can change your entire prespective on a topic. Shall we continue this debate?
969049062145253376 2018-02-28 03:17:55 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis @EliasWesteren And im not telling them how to love their lives. I have strggled with if I was gay myself. But I chose to respect these people as if they were a brother and now they are my closest friends. If someone layed a hand of them I would begin a fight to defend them.
969047119930814464 2018-02-28 03:10:12 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis @EliasWesteren Again I state- there are reasons I believe what I believe and same for you. Im not bashing anyone for this I am just pitting in my two cents. I still respect them. I still have other gay or bi or pan friends. Heck ive struggiled with if I was gay myself.

These people jad compassion for the Florida school and because of it, now have the reality that it could happen to them. Or you. Or me.
968930527452463104 2018-02-28 19:26:54 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis @EliasWesteren Yes I do. Im happy he believes what he does and is able to walk in it. But I also belive gay, bi, pan, etc is a choice you can make. Not a part of who you are. But I respect what you see even though it is not through my lens. Would you like to have a formal debate? 
968928907205455872 2018-02-28 19:20:27 UTC <Starflight109> @realDonaldTrump @Sheilamac46 @shanetrain44 @2naOnWhite Yep! Thats what the Christian faith is about!!!

968865040764981249 2018-02-28 15:06:41 UTC <Starflight109> @YouTube @KodiGaddis I dont agree with your veiws but im glad you are able to walk in them confidently. There are reasons I have my views but there are reasons you have yours too.

968183959413805056 2018-02-26 18:00:18 UTC <Starflight109> @UCLA @davidhogg111 @SunshineandHap That would have been some pretty suspicious activity on him for literally anyone who was paying mild attention. And yes, I know. My shcool has had a bomb threat two years in a row now.
968172788904353792 2018-02-26 17:15:55 UTC <Starflight109> @UCLA @davidhogg111 @SunshineandHap As someone who knows someone who diagnoses mental health issues, I can also tell you people without mental disabilities can be just as crazy as someone with ocd or depression (which he had cases of both)
968172296086179841 2018-02-26 17:13:57 UTC <Starflight109> @UCLA @davidhogg111 @SunshineandHap Where the fuck are you going to buy a bomb and I bet the deputy would have been more willing to walk up and shoot the mofo if he had a knife
968159170678620160 2018-02-26 16:21:48 UTC <Starflight109> @UCLA @davidhogg111 @SunshineandHap He was able to buy several guns. How the hell was he allowed to do that. That cannot be put on police misconduct. That is put on gun lobby groups and gun manufacturers.
968140210277158912 2018-02-26 15:06:27 UTC <Starflight109> @UCLA @davidhogg111 @SunshineandHap And people did intervene- 24 times with the police- 3 times with the FBI. We admit protocol should have been followed but how the hell was he still allowed to buy a gun.
968139866931367936 2018-02-26 15:05:06 UTC <Starflight109> @UCLA @davidhogg111 @SunshineandHap We arent calling for a complete and utter ban. We are calling for stricter rules, regulations, possibly something like Japans gun control system. We arent saying you cant have a gun, were saying that it should be a tougher process.
