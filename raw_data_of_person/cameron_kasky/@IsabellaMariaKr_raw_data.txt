971365291069530112 2018-03-07 12:41:47 UTC <IsabellaMariaKr> The fucking arrogance of telling people to vote while offering nothing in return astounds me.

969227845162733569 2018-03-01 15:08:20 UTC <IsabellaMariaKr> In many past elections there have been several Republicans who have said that they were running because God told them to. They were rightfully mocked for it. Now liberals want the same kind of candidate?! GTFO...https://twitter.com/RawStory/status/969215174833041410
963198721122013184 2018-02-12 23:50:45 UTC <IsabellaMariaKr> @SethMacFarlane I've figured out what really bugs me about Bill. He doesn't seem to be intellectually curious. He decides ahead of time which opinion fits his agenda and he even interrupts real experts on his show. Sometimes I agree with him, but that happens less these days.
963194280994050050 2018-02-12 23:33:06 UTC <IsabellaMariaKr> @SethMacFarlane @NancySinatra Seriously, liberals! Stop falling for these fake progressives. There are better candidates out there that don't take corporate money, but they don't get the same media attention as puppets like Kamala and Cory Booker. For example @HartsonForCA.
963191692005466113 2018-02-12 23:22:49 UTC <IsabellaMariaKr> @KamalaHarris If you want people to fall for these platitudes you should stop talking corporate money.

960634016402681856 2018-02-05 21:59:31 UTC <IsabellaMariaKr> The @washingtonpost's slogan is "Democracy dies in darkness". That's true.

960597563870273536 2018-02-05 19:34:40 UTC <IsabellaMariaKr> @SethMacFarlane @trekonomics Go one step further. The problem is  in politics, or corruption, as it should be called. Support uncorrupted politicians in every election you can, like @paulajean2018 and @HartsonForCA. Don't settle for Democrats that are paid to lose.

934926919459590144 2017-11-26 23:28:42 UTC <IsabellaMariaKr> @DrZuhdiJasser I think @cenkuygur behaved badly towards you because he is used to having his blood boil bcuz of fact free conservatives, so therefore he projected their behavior on to you, instead of listening to the points you were making. I think you made some good points.
