I agree that people have had the right to own guns AND OUR kids have the right to live.. Your right to a gun does NOT out trump my right to keep my children alive.. guns kill people, without a gun, no murders.. period!!!
963898741144002560 2018-02-14 22:12:22 UTC <CathCampbell8> @Debbi_Baker @CBSEveningNews @racquetball54 @redshoe9 As horrible as it is, the video must be seen.Since Sandy Hook there have been advocates for tape and release of the horror.. Looking at dead children no matter how awful will move people more than thoughts and prayers ever did...
963897814815145985 2018-02-14 22:08:42 UTC <CathCampbell8> @SpeakerRyan @CBSEveningNews @mgnelsonwrites Thank you speaking up... Obviously Americans that are appalled by gun violence are going to have to get nasty. Gun violence should be shown like this...

963896369332174848 2018-02-14 22:02:57 UTC <CathCampbell8> @CBSEveningNews I believe that unless we get "touched by this" it makes it easier for people to just shrug shoulders and start another day. It horrific to watch.. most will not take action.. It becomes as real to us as it was to them..
