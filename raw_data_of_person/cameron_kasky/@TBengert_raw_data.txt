971853562115444738 2018-03-08 21:02:00 UTC <TBengert> Women's day is not just a day, black history month is not just a month and so on, but rather are reminders that we always gotta be working to chip away at and dismantle systemic and institutionalized inequity.
971853560043499521 2018-03-08 21:01:59 UTC <TBengert> So it's important, especially those of us with power and privilege, to be constantly and consistently aware of history, of the present, and the complicity of those two things and how they inform power and privilege.
971853557283598336 2018-03-08 21:01:58 UTC <TBengert> At moments like this, like #WomensDay2018 , it's important to remember that progress and revolution are not linear. Progress and revolution must be active and ongoing. History operates in a spiral, as the times we're living in demonstrate
971833169573023747 2018-03-08 19:40:58 UTC <TBengert> Unpopular opinion: Joe Rogan's podcast is meh at best
971821937344352258 2018-03-08 18:56:20 UTC <TBengert> @SabrinaNoisehttps://twitter.com/sarahchad_/status/971788230617108480
971604364459741189 2018-03-07 04:31:46 UTC <TBengert> @bronwynturp LOL I just immediately thought of you. Also I'm still trying to cleanse my twitter of old Tim

971567928968704001 2018-03-07 02:06:59 UTC <TBengert> but like I'm no Forrest Gump, just probably related
971567927496511488 2018-03-07 02:06:59 UTC <TBengert> BOI I RAN FROM KIPLING TO LONG BRANCH TODAY TO CATCH A TRAIN AND WITHOUT EXTREME CONDITIONING PRO
971567926141702144 2018-03-07 02:06:59 UTC <TBengert> like you're playing as a Navy SEAL, some of the toughest trained soldiers on the planet, and you clicc that sticc to run AND YA BOI IS GASSED AFTER RUNNING LIKE A FOOT
971567924472373248 2018-03-07 02:06:58 UTC <TBengert> Like with how far I've realized I can run lately (from literally just being chronically late), I cant help but think how WEAK AF THE CALL OF DUTY SOLDIERS WERE
971518442519121920 2018-03-07 22:50:21 UTC <TBengert> Pro tip: if you wanna dramatically improve your cardio, do like I do and be chronically late for things
971516326991843333 2018-03-07 22:41:56 UTC <TBengert> If you see me about in your hood, please don't call Scully and Mulder or the Winchesters, I'm not a yeti, I'm just grumpy with bad hair and haven't shaved
971496914603700224 2018-03-07 21:24:48 UTC <TBengert> @PRESTOcard @TTChelps I appreciate the quick response!
971480833235267584 2018-03-07 20:20:54 UTC <TBengert> You know, if the @TTChelps actually had decent service that didn't see a 20 minute wait for a 501 during peak hours, and my @PRESTOcard actually had the balance it was supposed to have right now, I wouldn't be stuck waiting half an hour for a GO train. Fucking ridiculous
971458139831795712 2018-03-07 18:50:44 UTC <TBengert> When the cafeteria only has dark roast coffee going and it's almost like what's the point
971260868351623169 2018-03-06 05:46:50 UTC <TBengert> When a bunch of crusty old white men walk into your work on a Tuesday night and declare it party night. And then proceed to just sit and keep you there til midnight when everyone else left like an hour ago
971208223876362241 2018-03-06 02:17:39 UTC <TBengert> Of course as I start doing my closing tasks, as it's been dead all night, all the boiz have to show up
971165365735698432 2018-03-06 23:27:21 UTC <TBengert> I keep involuntarily recalling remnants of recurring stress dreams about the TTC
971148009789673472 2018-03-06 22:18:23 UTC <TBengert> Hi I'm tim, this is twitter and this is probably where I'm gonna rant about things
971146336761507841 2018-03-06 22:11:44 UTC <TBengert> Streetcar stops, you stop your car. Like it's not rocket science
971141736780238849 2018-03-06 21:53:27 UTC <TBengert> Also how bumpy buses are when you have to pee isn't fun
971141471092051970 2018-03-06 21:52:24 UTC <TBengert> Only when you really have to pee does the bus hit every fucking stop
971131995039379463 2018-03-06 21:14:45 UTC <TBengert> I hope this didn't come off whitesplainey, I just thought that the movie brought a lot to anti-colonial and anti-racist discourses through how it showcases black excellence and Ryan Coogler fuckin killed it.
971131991876882432 2018-03-06 21:14:44 UTC <TBengert> Does anyone in THIS universe have access to vibranium? No (that we know of lol), but the argument can be extended to other natural resources and how societies could have developed in their own unique, important and valid way.
971131989502853121 2018-03-06 21:14:43 UTC <TBengert> had it not been for colonization, and the ongoing fallout of colonization and had those peoples been allowed to retain control of the resources they had access to.
971131986852052992 2018-03-06 21:14:43 UTC <TBengert> knew and know EXACTLY what the fuck they are doing in putting vibranium to use, arguments around their foreign policy aside. This is how peoples in Africa and the rest of the Formerly Colonized World could have existed
971131984796880896 2018-03-06 21:14:42 UTC <TBengert> So the movie directly and fundamentally refutes and debunks the colonial thesis by showing the Wakandans, an African civilizarion (with unique groups within) living atop a large vibranium deposit for thousands of years
971131981269528577 2018-03-06 21:14:41 UTC <TBengert> But, like I said before, Wakanda is, on the whole, lightyears ahead of the rest of the world technologically
971131977360343045 2018-03-06 21:14:40 UTC <TBengert> but they're sitting on all these valuable resources, but because they are not us they don't understand how to use them like we do, we must take it.'
971131975347134464 2018-03-06 21:14:40 UTC <TBengert> Which therein lies the key point. The whole logic of colonialism was/is 'we're European and white and civilized, they in Africa are not European and not white and thus not civilized,
971131973501669378 2018-03-06 21:14:39 UTC <TBengert> So, like vibranium is a highly sought after resource in the Marvel universe, in addition to being pretty rare. It's pretty indestructible, light weight and malleable, as well as all the other ways Wakanda put it to use for their own tech
971131971333230592 2018-03-06 21:14:39 UTC <TBengert> I think that the vibranium in Black Panther is just as important as Erik to the anti-colonial theme of the film (dw there's no spoilers here), which like we know why he's so important
970540094288486400 2018-03-04 06:02:44 UTC <TBengert> Yo honestly #BlackPanther best pick up some hardware next year because like this is a joke
970536065495912448 2018-03-04 05:46:44 UTC <TBengert> I haven't used this in a while, but like #TheOscars needs to do better. Get Out was an actually socially relevant film; even Lady Bird had some important themes. It's a racist, sexist, classier, circle jerk. I'm too drunk for this #oscarssowhite #oscarssomale
