970777411242610688 2018-03-05 21:45:45 UTC <realBillyRansom> @GreggBeratan I can see why so often these things are posed as questions, as if we more or less don't already know the answer, which we all keep to ourselves but nod to each other in a kind of secret acknowledgement.   I just wish we didn't do that.
