970842555087716352 2018-03-05 02:04:37 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Libertarians, need to be armed. There is a huge problem in that libertarians understand the justifications for gun rights and support gun rights but many of them dont actually own guns and know how to shoot or carry a gun everyday.
970841744630788096 2018-03-05 02:01:23 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @BrowningMachine What exactly do you mean by tacticool? Im not objecting this can just have many meanings.
970725715820892160 2018-03-05 18:20:20 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Isnt it crazy that Marco Rubio one of the most moderate people on the right to keep and bear arms has been thrust into the nationwide debate and may be in the top ten currently hated politicians right now strictly by chance?
970342225069604866 2018-03-04 16:56:29 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Only ban public schools. I like to call that "common sense school reform"https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/970185321177591808

969411782728192001 2018-03-01 03:19:14 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @realDonaldTrump Any gun control and you will lose in 2020. Protect the second amendment like you said you would in the campaign.
969051637024198656 2018-02-28 03:28:09 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Cernovich @Andywarski This is also happening to gun YouTube channels on mass.
969033864487362561 2018-02-28 02:17:31 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> This premise is what is fundamentally flawed. This idea that you can ever truly be safe is completely insane. Its no wonder their solutions are so misguided when their stated goal "every single student being safe in school" is practically impossible.https://twitter.com/mad_madz_/status/968985038267342848
968955060565757954 2018-02-28 21:04:23 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Good to know Donald Trump is anti-gun as well as doesn't believe in due process...https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/968954417402834944
968691643879776257 2018-02-27 03:37:39 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> To use the words common sense in regards to any single thing the government could possibly do is to give the government too much credit.
968691202898976768 2018-02-27 03:35:54 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @jeffsessions @Flintlox I really think a lot of people fucked up and thought Trump as well as his administration were going to be pro-gun.
968614204658864129 2018-02-27 22:29:57 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @NRA @GunOwners @michaelmalice You are right.
968585727956144129 2018-02-27 20:36:47 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @RBPundit @UrbanAchievr Yes
968585557038297088 2018-02-27 20:36:06 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> The #NRA being so weak on the right to keep and bear arms is a significant reason we are where we are today. Does anyone think if @GunOwners had been the group Trump was so closely associated with we would even be having this stupid ass conversation about bump stocks? #BoycottNRA
968584439256223745 2018-02-27 20:31:40 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @piersmorgan I wouldnt care if you were born here and your family had been here generations. That has no bearing on the legitimacy of our right to keep and bear arms.
968583402118176769 2018-02-27 20:27:33 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @WalshFreedom A lot of us saw this coming.  http://theblowback.com/2018/02/24/theenemywithin/
968522929867755520 2018-02-27 16:27:15 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Agreeing with our anti-gun agenda
968522926206144512 2018-02-27 16:27:14 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Is anyone surprised by this? He signed the Firearms Owners Protection Act with the Hughes amendment attached. Reagan was not a pro-gun guy. Im getting really sick of the left using this stupid tactic where they trot out a conservative and say see look heres a conservativehttps://twitter.com/betoorourke/status/968315844609630208

968304998093328384 2018-02-26 02:01:16 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Flintlox I thought Tactical Response's Ventilated Operator Kit has one in it.

967912377671962625 2018-02-25 00:01:08 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Emma4Change @nuckles87 What youre saying is not consistent with exactly what the left has been saying which is if you are struggling emotionally or mentally than you cant handle your rights. Which one is it?
967911656117415936 2018-02-25 23:58:16 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Emma4Change @nuckles87 What do you advocate we do to get rid of semi automatic rifles?
967907109559062530 2018-02-25 23:40:12 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> How many times do we have to tell leftists that gun rights has literally nothing to do with hunting?
967904730403016705 2018-02-25 23:30:45 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Emma4Change If youre suffering from PTSD maybe you shouldnt be leading a movement to influence public policy that will fundamentally change the course of the country for the worse.
967810677183303680 2018-02-25 17:17:01 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> I tempted to think this is awesome seeing as Dianne Feinstein has been one of the more out there anti-gun people in the Senate for a long time, but chances are all this means is there will be someone more anti-gun to replace her.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/967780248489148417

967807190143852544 2018-02-25 17:03:09 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @andyrutledge Sorry if I misunderstood you. And yes I agree, a lot of people are probably joining the NRA right now. Were on the same side man keep up.
967805003598585856 2018-02-25 16:54:28 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @andyrutledge I am not some sort of anti-NRA shill,I just want them to do a better job. Theyve sold us down the river too many times.
967804643920306177 2018-02-25 16:53:02 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @andyrutledge Seems like your only objection is my use of the phrase pro-gun movement. Thats not what is of the most importance, we are at more risk than ever and we have the equivalent of John McCain representing us on the national level defending our liberty.
967802535011602432 2018-02-25 16:44:39 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> I actually think there is some great potential to unite gun owners in this time of unprecedented attack against us, but if the #NRA is the organization that unites us, we may not get what we want. http://theblowback.com/2018/02/24/theenemywithin/
967802109331755009 2018-02-25 16:42:58 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Everytime they say this is all we want there is another shooting and then they just want a little more.

967801281388732416 2018-02-25 16:39:41 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @andyrutledge That is not necessarily a good thing if they dont change. Theyre the reason we are in this position in the first place.   http://theblowback.com/2018/02/24/theenemywithin/

967543643866304518 2018-02-24 23:35:55 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Im a gun owner and Im a good shot doesnt make your argument more valid.https://twitter.com/joshuagrubbsphd/status/966445176477675520
967485245212807169 2018-02-24 19:43:52 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Have any the survivors of the #ParklandSchoolShooting come out and criticized the Sheriff the way they are criticizing gun owners and the #NRA If not, why? #BanAssaultWeapons
967433763302133760 2018-02-24 16:19:17 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> So Im tempted to defend them even though they have, and continue to sell gun owners out.
967433758914818048 2018-02-24 16:19:16 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Im having a hard time looking at the #BoycottNRA stuff objectively because I despise the @NRA for being too weak on gun rights. But at the same time the people boycotting them are obviously doing it because they perceive the NRA to be the worst gun rights organization.

967214472619352064 2018-02-23 01:47:54 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Flintlox If i remember correctly there was talk during the campaign that he was a candidate for a cabinet position, can't remember which position, but that would have been great.
967213035604578305 2018-02-23 01:42:12 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Flintlox Didn't he fight soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 80s or something?

967160842440658945 2018-02-23 22:14:48 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @stillgray Whats wrong with allowing any of these people mentioned to be armed?
967152365970345985 2018-02-23 21:41:07 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Arming teachers is not a good idea. Allowing teachers to be armed is a good idea. I dont want the state forcing any teacher to be armed and they definitely shouldnt be buying their guns and or training. Theyd probably end up with Hi-Point pistols and shitty training.
967151038926065664 2018-02-23 21:35:51 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @redsteeze @ptmk25 Rightfully so, hopefully this sinks the @NRA so we can replace them with something better. @GunOwners perhaps.
967134985437286401 2018-02-23 20:32:03 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @andyrutledge I wonder what the left would be saying if someone had the sense to point out that teachers should have medical training.
967108213433884673 2018-02-23 18:45:40 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @LibertyHangout And there will be no right to bear arms if we keep letting those compromising bastards at the @NRA speak for us on the national level.
967097362962317312 2018-02-23 18:02:33 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @realDonaldTrump might actually be infinitely more dangerous for gun rights than @BarackObama ever was because whatever Trump does will be backed by the @NRA and it will be perceived as good. At least with Obama people KNEW what he wanted was terrible.
967095435302227969 2018-02-23 17:54:54 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @ABC I look forward to him stating his desire to also raise the age to join the military and get sent overseas to die for neocons for the sake of consistency.
967095174252949505 2018-02-23 17:53:51 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Congratulations, you just did a whole lot of nothing to stop a single mass shooting.https://twitter.com/abc/status/967072165043453952
967072154872352768 2018-02-23 16:22:23 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @johniadarola Dont pay for them to, just allow them to if they wish. The ones who would go to the trouble to qualify on their own dime are the kind that may save lives.
967050482496757762 2018-02-23 14:56:16 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @ChrisLoesch Its terrible the way she gets treated but until the @NRA gets its shit together no self respecting gun owner should give them a dime. No more compromise.

966823999836696577 2018-02-22 23:56:18 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Flintlox He's been doing a bit too much defending the @NRA lately but yeah he's got a lot of valuable information to give.
966823353809072128 2018-02-22 23:53:44 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Flintlox James yeager had a good video on this kind of thing he put out after Sandy Hook, cops have got to get out of the mindset of "wait for backup" waiting for backup gets people killed. I'd link the video but YouTube deleted his channel a while back.

966712533150261251 2018-02-22 16:33:23 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @piersmorgan The way to prevent disturbed children from killing people is to recognize what causes children to become disturbed. Have strong communities where people are willing to reach out to someone before they are ever a risk to themselves or others. No gov action required.
966711449010819072 2018-02-22 16:29:04 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @BarackObama They're being way more honest about this issue than you ever were, they want to ban all guns. It's not going to happen.
966704942802198529 2018-02-22 16:03:13 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> If you live in a country that has already been disarmed your opinion on whether citizens of another country should have the right to keep and bear arms is void, you already gave up your choice in the matter so you have no vested interest.
966704427708055553 2018-02-22 16:01:10 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @piersmorgan You are a coward, you have no right to even speak on this, your countrymen no longer have a choice in whether they are armed. Americans won't bow to the state and give up our guns the way you did.
966701801667026944 2018-02-22 15:50:44 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @scotthortonshow That's the @NRA there are other organizations that more effectively represent the rights of everyday people. But overall I agree, the constant law enforcement, and military worship in the pro-gun movement is a problem.
966700272822161408 2018-02-22 15:44:40 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @NRA @Bradybuzz Brady Campaign solution to school shootings = use state violence to strip peaceful people of their property.
966699892335837184 2018-02-22 15:43:09 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> They can repeal the second amendment if they want. That will not keep us from demanding our gun rights. #GunReformNow #CNNTownHall #StudentsStandUp
966699298074386438 2018-02-22 15:40:47 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @johniadarola Lol @ you thinking if the second Amendment was repealed pro-gun people wouldn't still want to keep their gun rights.
966697202251980800 2018-02-22 15:32:28 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> It's so rare that this is the case, but Massie is a truly pro-gun politician. Keep it up!https://twitter.com/repthomasmassie/status/966694735573405696
966693741456248836 2018-02-22 15:18:42 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Cernovich @esaagar Maybe the @NRA should quit helping them by giving in to all of this anti-gun "compromise" bullshit. It's not a winning strategy.
966689491367944193 2018-02-22 15:01:49 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @johniadarola Why don't you come speak at an event filled with pro-gun people who hate you and see how you hold up? He did a terrible job no doubt but that took guts, I hardly think you would be able to handle something like that.
966684723253776384 2018-02-22 14:42:52 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Honestly they're both trash.

966556880440053761 2018-02-21 06:14:52 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Gulardian You're not going to convince me of the value of democracy with quotes. Property rights are not up for a vote.

966526552023412736 2018-02-21 04:14:21 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> The @NRA is anti-gun. They are behind a lot of the so called "compromise" we've had over the years when it comes to gun legislation. They are also the ones who have led the fight on banning "rate increasing devices". @GunOwners is the way to go.https://twitter.com/ericdjuly/status/966525111661678592
966516456300171265 2018-02-21 03:34:14 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> The left cheering for ban on all semi-automatic rifles on mainstream television can only be good for the pro-gun movement.

966393905993396224 2018-02-21 19:27:16 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Flintlox These people are completely out of their minds...
966391590511087617 2018-02-21 19:18:04 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @johniadarola @KeiraJaneReed1 The rights of people to own voluntarily obtained property such as firearms.
966350073419382786 2018-02-21 16:33:06 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @RawStory It's doesn't necessarily follow that just because you want to honor the victims that you MUST support violently stripping the rights of the people to own semi automatic rifles.
966334322662891520 2018-02-21 15:30:30 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @jamesparkershow Don't you know James? There couldn't possibly BE a pro-gun survivor of a mass shooting! They are all so enlightened and understand all of the statistics and arguments for and against gun control, there's no waaaayyyyyy.
966333084382703616 2018-02-21 15:25:35 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @johniadarola The fact that children are influencing a mass political movement to violently remove private property from Americans is even more sick. This most recent shooting in particular is evidence of the state's inability to prevent this kind of tragedy.

966172787068063744 2018-02-20 04:48:37 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @shannonrwatts @DavidOAtkins How much longer are we going to tolerate low IQ leftists advocating for the removal of the property rights of the citizenry? There are over 300 million guns in the United States, what exactly do you think you guys will do to get rid of all of them?
966165312004608005 2018-02-20 04:18:55 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @deray @zerwiski The police are not to be trusted with using force. We should have gun control which will be carried out by the police. Pick one.
966132702813523973 2018-02-20 02:09:20 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @shannonrwatts Fortunately for you the @NRA will probably fold to anti-gun demands like they always do.
966129964998422529 2018-02-20 01:58:28 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @piersmorgan You are proof the British people worth a damn left the country a couple of hundred years ago. We are not giving up our guns like you cowards did.
966127750481436672 2018-02-20 01:49:40 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @MittRomney Should be opposed VEHEMENTLY by pro-gun Utahans, just look at Massachusetts the state he was governor of if you want to see what he stands for. He is not a friend to gun rights.

966125005263245312 2018-02-20 01:38:45 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @deray Who exactly will be the ones enforcing an assault weapons ban deray? Why don't you answer me that?
966124049301737472 2018-02-20 01:34:57 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @MSNBC @CNN @realDonaldTrump This is a terrible mistake, stick to what you said in your original statement after the shooting. We need stronger communities looking out for troubled people and increased security at schools. Do not betray your pro-gun base.
966123298890354688 2018-02-20 01:31:58 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> We already have background checks, he passed a background check. Don't betray the millions of gun owners who voted for you because they thought you were pro-gun.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/966119932793585664
966117044650377216 2018-02-20 01:07:07 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @mike_Zollo If you have any knowledge of the history of gun control you would know there is no compromising with these people. The whole 20th century was filled with the @NRA supporting bullshit gun control, not one more inch. We never get any right we give away back.
966115138859356160 2018-02-20 00:59:33 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @RawStory Sorry but traumatized children being used for the preservation of the left's political power do not get to dictate policy.
966114523496243200 2018-02-20 00:57:06 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @Flintlox Democracy was a mistake.
966105973642399745 2018-02-20 00:23:08 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> @GunOwners Thank you for not backing down! We must be willing to stand on principle even when someone we thought was on our side of the argument makes a bad decision.

966104974903205888 2018-02-20 00:19:10 UTC <TheBlowBackBlog> Traumatized individuals having the ability to affect public policy through media exposure is an inherit flaw with democratic governments. The survivors of the #ParklandSchoolShooting have my sympathy, but it seems they are being used by the left to preserve their own political
