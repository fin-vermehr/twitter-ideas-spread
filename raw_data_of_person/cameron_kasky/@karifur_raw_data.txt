834422348665196544 2017-02-22 15:19:25 UTC <karifur> @TheBloggess @AdeleKSF I was hoping you wouldn't see that lol
834147279401582593 2017-02-21 21:06:23 UTC <karifur> @GeckyBoz looks like it's not hidden anymore! :)
832721796877078529 2017-02-17 22:42:02 UTC <karifur> can't wait to read it!
832682968518782977 2017-02-17 20:07:44 UTC <karifur> @TheBloggess I argue that YOU did this, because if you weren't so damned awesome, we wouldn't have bought so many of your books.
832355026836344832 2017-02-16 22:24:37 UTC <karifur> @Evan_McMullin Maybe he is temporary, but how much damage will he be allowed to do before his time is up?
832354077241638912 2017-02-16 22:20:51 UTC <karifur> @Medium @jk_rowling I'm going to save this insightful commentary to accompany my Sunday morning coffee
832267404134727683 2017-02-16 16:36:26 UTC <karifur> @TheBloggess I had to ban your books from my gym playlist for my own safety after I almost fell off a treadmill from laughing

826475363555561478 2017-01-31 17:00:56 UTC <karifur> @FargoEscapee Oh, well why didn't you SAY it was Dijon mustard? Everyone knows Dijon mustard is for pompous dudes in limos.
826463999353057280 2017-01-31 16:15:47 UTC <karifur> @FargoEscapee I don't even remember that being an issue. I always put mustard on my burgers. Does that make me elitist too?

758724425168453632 2016-07-28 18:02:54 UTC <karifur> @pleitch I miss the hell outta that band. I just stumbled across a YouTube channel that has a whole bunch of their songs uploaded

758670009258250240 2016-07-28 14:26:40 UTC <karifur> #iamafeminist because there are assholes trolling this hashtag, telling women that it's our fault we are marginalized #fuckyou
758669368385384448 2016-07-28 14:24:07 UTC <karifur> #iamafeminist because if a man cries, he is considered feminine and weak. Emotions are not feminine & femininity is not weakness.
758668318127423488 2016-07-28 14:19:57 UTC <karifur> #iamafeminist because for some reason it is a radical idea that a woman can do the same work men do
758499704531410944 2016-07-27 03:09:56 UTC <karifur> @ianfurness 3.9 - the symmetry is dreadful
757980825312894977 2016-07-26 16:48:06 UTC <karifur> Funny how the rudest hard-core Never-Hillary assholes seem to be white, cisgender heterosexuals. #checkyourprivilege #electionswears

756223707131940864 2016-07-21 20:25:56 UTC <karifur> @mareserinitatis There wasn't even 1 GOP candidate in this election that didn't make me afraid for the future of our country
756223446284066816 2016-07-21 20:24:54 UTC <karifur> @mareserinitatis The words came from the article, not from me. My fear started much earlier in this electoral process.
