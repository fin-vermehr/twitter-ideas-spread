971880531980898304 2018-03-08 22:49:10 UTC <BoundForBedlam> @bluehurricane18 That is awful. I am so sorry. Despite the relationship you had, I know it's still very painful. I'm an only child & have no family to turn to. I don't speak to my aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. My mom is either homeless (her own fault) or dead. I have no idea & don't want to know.
971878628689633281 2018-03-08 22:41:36 UTC <BoundForBedlam> @bluehurricane18 Your mom or your sister? That's horrible, either way. My mom threatened suicide, but didn't care when I actually attempted it. She's not worth it.
971878341346316288 2018-03-08 22:40:27 UTC <BoundForBedlam> @bluehurricane18 I feel ya. Luckily, all of my close friends and my wife know my mother is batshit, so they support me. It's usually just new people I meet that say that now.
971877300357738496 2018-03-08 22:36:19 UTC <BoundForBedlam> @bluehurricane18 Autocorrect, I hate you.

971876706394034176 2018-03-08 22:33:58 UTC <BoundForBedlam> @bluehurricane18 I replied because I know how you feel and wanted to remind you that you aren't alone. No worries.
971876364876963841 2018-03-08 22:32:36 UTC <BoundForBedlam> @bluehurricane18 That's a natural feeling. I went no contact, but since my father is gone, I still long for things to be normal with my mom. I know there's no hope for her. Took my dad dying to actually push me to drop her. It still hurts, and always will.

My mother is a malignant narcissist & I spent the first 40 yrs of my life suffering alone until I disowned her nearly 5 years ago. Now, I'm suffering under Trump with the entire world. It unfortunately doesn't feel any better than coping alone.
