964909887061860353 2018-02-17 17:10:18 UTC <JenSlemp13> From a friend All over the world children are dying in wars that people in this country are supporting and some people making money from. It is time for humanity to wake up and stop killing each other. Where's the vision, where's the role modeling for creating peaceful societies?
964893095782264833 2018-02-17 16:03:35 UTC <JenSlemp13> To all of the children who grew up in South Central LA - I see you. I've seen you since I was 13 years old when I moved to Cali. I'm sorry I never had the guts to rise up with you to help your community bring an end to the blood baths you endured. I am sorry.  #EndGunViolence
964890889515540481 2018-02-17 15:54:49 UTC <JenSlemp13> To all of OUR children across the country-I am so sorry. I'm sorry I didn't have a louder voice.

One thing is for sure, we are failing our children.
