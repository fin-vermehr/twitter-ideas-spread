967125065514061824 2018-02-23 19:52:38 UTC <benjamin_silver> @JesseRodriguez Total hoax though. People plead guilty in hoaxes all the time.

967070615109865472 2018-02-23 16:16:16 UTC <benjamin_silver> @edatpost @cdnice55 He arguably did what cops are trained to do in that moment, too: wait for backup. What's his glock going to do going in blind against a student with an AR-15 who looks just like the other students?
966576809683881984 2018-02-21 07:34:04 UTC <benjamin_silver> @StacheESQ Hawks could use her. #KANE4ROONEY

966572294008164352 2018-02-21 07:16:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @MarkLazerus At least it went to the more deserving team. Can't believe one of those shots didn't go in during OT.
966568392017743872 2018-02-21 07:00:37 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ChrisKuc Not sure how they call that after swallowing their whistles for 18 minutes.
966442268168278016 2018-02-21 22:39:27 UTC <benjamin_silver> @KT_So_It_Goes The costs are really beside the point. I don't think many would hesitate to spend 50 or even 100 billion per year to protect students. The problem is, this wouldn't work. Great, you've got armed guards. They'll get the shooter after he shoots up a classroom or two with 30 kids.
966379492724920320 2018-02-21 18:30:00 UTC <benjamin_silver> @HillaryClinton Thank you for everything you do, Madame President!
966369056851886080 2018-02-21 17:48:32 UTC <benjamin_silver> @2020fight @mythicbitch027 The problem is that arming teachers simply won't work to protect children.
966368956243116032 2018-02-21 17:48:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @2020fight @mythicbitch027 The retiring teachers won't be taking the guns with them. But that's beside the point. Read my other points in this thread; I agree with gun control. I'm simply saying the cost argument is a bad take. If we could protect children for several billion dollars, we absolutely would.
966230458274066433 2018-02-21 08:37:47 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AmericanMuller Don't worry, there will soon be a new crop of bots to inflate your fragile ego.
966230058254946304 2018-02-21 08:36:12 UTC <benjamin_silver> @TejasPsycho Sorry you lost your bots, snowflake.
966229220996341761 2018-02-21 08:32:52 UTC <benjamin_silver> @williamlegate It's actually hard to find the Trump idiots because no one is left to retweet them. Funny how that works.
966227645670322177 2018-02-21 08:26:37 UTC <benjamin_silver> @2020fight @mythicbitch027 The US spends over $600 billion per year on elementary and secondary education.
966226923943800833 2018-02-21 08:23:44 UTC <benjamin_silver> @2020fight @mythicbitch027 You realize how many teachers retire each year? This country doesn't invest in more teachers; it barely replaces those who retire. Anyway, the number suggested in the original tweet is less than a hundredth of a percent of the debt. Money isn't the issue here.
966127316018450432 2018-02-20 01:47:56 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Jim_Gardner @robkelner That's a very fair statement. Hell, I have no issue with AR-15s or even more powerful weapons being owned by sportsmen and restricted to gun ranges and clubs.

965992788532883458 2018-02-20 16:53:22 UTC <benjamin_silver> @girlsreallyrule He recorded the call. And Person A knows exactly who he or she is. Can we get some cameras on Jared/Don Jr./Erik Prince/Flynn/Flynn Jr.? Who is sweating?
965841262359339008 2018-02-19 06:51:16 UTC <benjamin_silver> @2020fight @theIastninja Yup exactly. You could have a trained team of 5 cops in every school. A shooter could still take out a classroom or two full of students before the team can respond.
965799931339558912 2018-02-19 04:07:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @2020fight Sure, but the cost still wouldn't be relatively high. The big problem is that if wouldn't work to keep schools safe and might even make them more dangerous. And that's ignoring the issues with making teachers do this.
965798156968611840 2018-02-19 03:59:58 UTC <benjamin_silver> @2020fight How is it not? Not like the country is adding many teachers. Regardless, cost is not the reason teachers should not have guns.
965796102422388736 2018-02-19 03:51:49 UTC <benjamin_silver> @2020fight I'm in agreement that it's a bad idea, but $1.6 billion as a one time cost is absolutely nothing compared to the federal budget.
965601517372887041 2018-02-19 14:58:36 UTC <benjamin_silver> @imillhiser He's further from contemporary norms than any of them. I think that eliminates Buchanan and Coolidge at least.

965350569085894661 2018-02-18 22:21:25 UTC <benjamin_silver> Now the question becomes: will Manafort spend several decades in federal prison or will he flip?

963951848477675520 2018-02-14 01:43:24 UTC <benjamin_silver> @UCLADGR @FoaRyan Universal background checks to begin with. No loopholes. No Dylann Roof getting his on a technicality. Limits on capacity and rate of fire. I understand it won't limit or stop every shooting, but it will go a long way.

963871387025903616 2018-02-14 20:23:41 UTC <benjamin_silver> @UCLADGR @llilly Friendly fire. He's mocking the gun nuts who are about to say "now is not the time to talk about gun control."
963871160709640192 2018-02-14 20:22:47 UTC <benjamin_silver> @UCLADGR @FoaRyan Generally, you're talking about civilians firing weapons in a crowded and chaotic school environment. So either way, you're an idiot.

960890004468830209 2018-02-06 14:56:44 UTC <benjamin_silver> @kurteichenwald I'm expecting one more round of sell-off, but this was always just a correction.
960885293967699970 2018-02-06 14:38:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @keithboykin Honestly, that wasn't bad based on where futures were. Looked poised for a 1k drop. And now lmost back even today.
960622570574958593 2018-02-05 21:14:02 UTC <benjamin_silver> @armandodkos It's really incredible. I'm worried that he's going to do something really stupid if we have a real crash - threaten tariffs or whatever.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/05/white-house-says-its-concerned-about-stock-market-drop.html
960622175454662657 2018-02-05 21:12:28 UTC <benjamin_silver> @armandodkos White House put out a statement this morning that it was "concerned," which certainly didn't help. Amateur hour.
960615048925376514 2018-02-05 20:44:09 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mikefreemanNFL To be clear, he means physically attacking or threatening. This was in reference to the planned right-wing terrorist attack on CNN.
960614307762524162 2018-02-05 20:41:12 UTC <benjamin_silver> @jackjonesbabe Well that's true. I thought you meant long-term. 2010 showed us how short everyone's memory is.
960613897567862786 2018-02-05 20:39:35 UTC <benjamin_silver> @jackjonesbabe Would it be though? We've been through this already with them.

956654721875480579 2018-01-25 22:27:14 UTC <benjamin_silver> @tomwatson If the "end to chain migration" doesn't apply to nuclear families, as Trump has previously suggested, it gets interesting. I could care less about $25B border security beyond it being a waste of money. Makes Trump look stupid.

956379948272570369 2018-01-24 04:15:23 UTC <benjamin_silver> @_celia_marie_ @WiseAndEck @Cycle4 @chileanbob It's mostly lawyers saying it. It was cathartic watching her. I loved the gif of her tossing the letter aside. But the "I just signed your death warrant" part made my skin crawl. When we disregard norms for bad defendants, they tend to erode for all.
956306403601387520 2018-01-24 23:23:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @karesf @armandodkos It sure was cathartic, and this was a most irregular case. But when we ignore norms for a monster, it has a tendency to erode those norms for less monstrous defendants.
956303839363248131 2018-01-24 23:12:57 UTC <benjamin_silver> @armandodkos I've heard from some very progressive defense attorneys who had concerns today. I'm conflicted because I believe if anyone deserved it, Nasser did. But you're not alone and you're not wrong, despite the reaction.
955979157720223744 2018-01-23 01:42:47 UTC <benjamin_silver> @tperkins @USATODAY @JPDuffy And FRC is ready to endorse unprotected extramarital sex with porn stars.

955527833958436865 2018-01-22 19:49:23 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AltYelloNatPark We still have that golden opportunity on February 8, and we have it with health insurance for 9 million kids not hanging over our heads.
955512591580884998 2018-01-22 18:48:49 UTC <benjamin_silver> @GerryConnolly @the_gneech I think we all believe McConnell will break his promise. That's the point. More leverage in 17 days without CHIP hanging over our heads.
955512386072535041 2018-01-22 18:48:00 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mkraju @ScottPeezy This administration cannot force the courts to move any faster. Deporting 800,000 people would be a massive, massive undertaking even with accurate data. The US has never even deported 500,000 in an entire year.
955508161087197184 2018-01-22 18:31:12 UTC <benjamin_silver> @GerryConnolly I don't trust McConnell, but this deal doesn't require trust. If he doesn't fulfill his promise, shut it down on February 8.
955506317233479680 2018-01-22 18:23:53 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mkraju @ScottPeezy No, a single judge cannot overturn that stay. And deportations must be processed. They can't just put people on a plane.
955496175674843137 2018-01-22 17:43:35 UTC <benjamin_silver> @BradMossEsq Sure, but it's better for Dems if the Senate passes and House won't touch it. Dems are largely on defense in the Senate and completely on offense in the House this year.
955495564602413057 2018-01-22 17:41:09 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mkraju @ScottPeezy To be clear, one Dreamer deported is too many. But there's currently a stay on Trump's order and deportations take time.
955495426735640577 2018-01-22 17:40:36 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mkraju @ScottPeezy They are not going to deport 800,000 people in two weeks.
955494775980949504 2018-01-22 17:38:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SenSchumer @JeffreyGuterman I don't understand why he has to trust the GOP. If they don't follow through, we shut it down again in 17 days.
955494362959491072 2018-01-22 17:36:23 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mkraju Then we shut it down again in two weeks. What's the problem?
955489621818990592 2018-01-22 17:17:32 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Mikel_Jollett This one has a failsafe though. A short CR let's us shut it down again in February.
954600880015335424 2018-01-19 06:26:00 UTC <benjamin_silver> @RepJayapal @brookscowan You might have a tiny little point if not for the fact that Yertle couldn't even keep his caucus together.

954538134741676032 2018-01-19 02:16:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SenSchumer @AlGiordano I don't love the strategy with at least 2 GOP against it. I think solidarity might have been the call.
954474506713796608 2018-01-19 22:03:50 UTC <benjamin_silver> @armandodkos I love the part where he started peddling Uranium One conspiracy theories after the Big Dog rejected him.
954466355562074112 2018-01-19 21:31:26 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Nate_Cohn I don't think they need to lift a finger. They have a bipartisan deal on the table with at least 56 votes.
954228438155526144 2018-01-18 05:46:03 UTC <benjamin_silver> @samstein @RepChuntley I don't know. Schumer's experience with Manischewitz wine has to count for something.

Batshit conspiracy theorists that are unfortunately followed by tens of thousands. It's depressing there are any people at all like that, let alone thousands.

945785634383454210 2017-12-26 22:37:21 UTC <benjamin_silver> @thehill @WontBeSilent2 @ekpennoyer @joshuasharf So your argument is the voter decided not to vote for any gubernatorial candidate? The point on this exercise is deciphering voter intent. You cannot do that with any degree of confidence from this ballot.
945780073835237376 2017-12-26 22:15:16 UTC <benjamin_silver> @thehill @ekpennoyer @joshuasharf That's because she cannot challenge the ruling itself. VA law prohibits appeal.
945779760852033536 2017-12-26 22:14:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @joshchafetz The problem here is that a partisan court called it wrong and this is the candidate's only grounds for redress. If she doesn't challenge, a coin flip could invalidate the votes of over 11000 people who voted for her.
945738115137835008 2017-12-26 19:28:32 UTC <benjamin_silver> @BradMossEsq Solid strategy tweeting that garbage from his business account, too. Hey Stockton, CA, folks: don't get your computer fixed at @BearWirePC.
945729665452380160 2017-12-26 18:54:57 UTC <benjamin_silver> @WalkerBragman @AngryBlackLady Helps explain his hatred for Hillary, too.
945472761606164480 2017-12-25 01:54:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @WalkerBragman @BadJohnBrown Oh yeah, sure. And Hillary was just making some phone calls. You Bros are pathetic. Anything to smear Hillary.
945472245572493313 2017-12-25 01:52:04 UTC <benjamin_silver> @WalkerBragman @BadJohnBrown Or a newspaper I guess.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/28/us/politics/how-hillary-clinton-went-undercover-to-examine-race-in-education.html
945470472082329601 2017-12-25 01:45:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @WalkerBragman @BadJohnBrown You clearly have absolutely no knowledge of Hillary's long and storied career. Maybe stop kneeling at the alter of St. Bernard for a minute and grab a book.
945459193062088704 2017-12-25 01:00:12 UTC <benjamin_silver> @reesetheone1 @scribejones I didn't say Bernie voters. I said Bros. They have the same burn it all down mentality. Same dosmissivness of those outside their chosen WWC demographic. Same treatment of women they disagree with.
945458163083628544 2017-12-25 00:56:06 UTC <benjamin_silver> @WalkerBragman @BadJohnBrown She never lied about her speeches. Damn her for making money after spending three decades fighting for progressive ideals! I bet the Hillary that went undercover in the Deep South to expose segregation would never forgive her. What the fuck have you done?
945401651640307712 2017-12-25 21:11:33 UTC <benjamin_silver> @reesetheone1 But her emails! Is he not a Republican already? I really couldn't tell the difference. The Bro crowd and Trump crowd are remarkably similar.
945400968316891137 2017-12-25 21:08:50 UTC <benjamin_silver> @BadJohnBrown @WalkerBragman You just summarized the horseshit Donna Brazile smears against Hillary and the DNC that you've been regurgitating, as well as Bernie's primary strategy against Hillary. Good job! You're learning!
945069664757051393 2017-12-24 23:12:21 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AshaRangappa_ @Afterseven Thanks for letting us all know you don't have the attention span to read a 10 tweet thread.
944254417800450048 2017-12-22 17:12:51 UTC <benjamin_silver> @marykbruce @ABCPolitics @jllgraham It's almost like you dopes are too myopic to see past next week. The cuts (where they exist) for middle class and working poor are smaller than cuts for rich and, unlike cuts for corporations, are temporary. Costs will also fall heavily on everyone but the rich.
944246670933549056 2017-12-22 16:42:04 UTC <benjamin_silver> @marykbruce @ABCPolitics Who'd have thought robbing the vast majority of Americans to bankroll a massive tax cut for the wealthy would be unpopular?
943712516185739264 2017-12-20 05:19:31 UTC <benjamin_silver> @africabytotobot @ElmoCarp No. The line before is: "It's gonna take a lot to take/drag me away from you."  In other words, not even a hundred men or more could drag him away.

941772504040910850 2017-12-15 20:50:36 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ForecasterEnten They're apparently banking on people seeing their tax bills and going "oh wow! I totally remember what I paid last year and this saved me like $90! So what if millionaires saved my entire salary 8 times over?"

941163758373785600 2017-12-13 04:31:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Zigmanfreud Bad take, John. This isn't your entry-level scumbag. Weinstein built an empire off of sexual abuse and harassment. There are dozens of credible accusations of assault and even rape. This isn't an Al Franken situation.

938071938081198080 2017-12-05 15:45:53 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Tierney_Megan Watch Republicans freak out as they ignore their overlords handing them a tax scam at almost 500,000 times that rate.
937332814516592640 2017-12-03 14:48:52 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SenateMajLdr @GStephanopoulos @ABCPolitics That's because Republicans prefer pedophiles over people who prosecuted the KKK.

936659377477611521 2017-12-01 18:12:52 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mmurraypolitics See, we might have some idea on this if a bill actually existed. It doesn't.
936646149825540096 2017-12-01 17:20:18 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SethAbramson I've been with you right up until point (c). Abbe Lowell is still the best in the business, even if it does sicken me that he's representing Kushner.

933495052915085312 2017-11-22 00:38:58 UTC <benjamin_silver> @HillaryClinton @RobbyMook @rolandsmartin Not to mention the fact that the Clinton campaign pulled out all the stops in PA and still lost.
933494820437479425 2017-11-22 00:38:03 UTC <benjamin_silver> @HillaryClinton @RobbyMook @rolandsmartin You're talking about a bandaid. The analytics and people said the same thing until the Comey letter. Maybe the analytics didn't pick up what the people did immediately, but doesn't matter. Can't effectively shift resources that quickly.

933099929521627139 2017-11-21 22:28:54 UTC <benjamin_silver> Honestly, I think it's more about what he sees in Doug Jones. The soft on crime bit is a dog whistle for "Doug Jones loves black people."
933061443167145986 2017-11-21 19:55:58 UTC <benjamin_silver> @keithboykin @StevenEhrlich3 This is far worse than Benghazi.
933009121888161792 2017-11-21 16:28:03 UTC <benjamin_silver> @tomwatson @Deemoney521 @ego_lies It's hilarious where you draw the line. Bernie took NRA money in the 90s but he's pure as the driven snow.
933008648770605056 2017-11-21 16:26:10 UTC <benjamin_silver> @sabrina68 LOL we lost? You didn't endorse Northam. The supposed Berniecrats were backed far more heavily by traditional Dem funds than Our Revolution or anyone associated with Bernie. And you guys aren't any more progressive. Just power hungry.
932725572719038466 2017-11-20 21:41:20 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PromoteMyCause @WontComply Here: http://www.kabc.com/2017/11/16/leeann-tweeden-on-senator-al-franken/ "When I saw the script, Franken had written a moment when his character comes at me for a kiss. I suspected what he was after, but I figured I could turn my head at the last minute, or put my hand over his mouth, to get more laughs from the crowd."

932323792168345602 2017-11-19 19:04:48 UTC <benjamin_silver> @tomwatson This, Brazile's book, Bernie's op-ed are all of a piece. They expected us to lose this month. They wanted us to lose. They care only about taking power.

932085074106892289 2017-11-18 03:16:13 UTC <benjamin_silver> @BradMossEsq He published my law school classmates' term papers. Only reason I didn't join them is I didn't win the seating lotto.

931596074942369792 2017-11-17 18:53:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ForecasterEnten Oh I assure you that it's him. That is vintage Bill O'Neil. Doubt you find an Ohio Dem who doesn't want him to resign. At least two gubernatorial candidates called for it already.
931559256859594752 2017-11-17 16:26:49 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SenAlexander @mikedebonis Playing chicken with people's lives. Lovely.

931197000669941761 2017-11-16 16:27:20 UTC <benjamin_silver> @GrantJKidney So Moore should drop out and Trump should resign, right?
931196446006706176 2017-11-16 16:25:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @alfranken @kleinstar @EllenMorris1222 @baggotry That's not what I said. Franken's behavior is reprehensible. But I do not expect him to resign and Dems lose seat when the GOP is about to send a child molester to the Senate. We need to elect more women and remove abusers, but in the meantime, Dems fight for women. GOP deosn't.

929915442466050049 2017-11-12 03:34:53 UTC <benjamin_silver> @richardalangley What is that supposed to prove? The man thinks white people inherently have superior intelligence. He is a white supremacist. By definition.
929902943196860417 2017-11-12 02:45:13 UTC <benjamin_silver> @elizabethcatte @richardalangley I've literally called one person a white supremacist. And you are completely ignoring the incontrovertible evidence that he is a white supremacist. Is Murray related to you or something?
929826964046778368 2017-11-12 21:43:18 UTC <benjamin_silver> @elizabethcatte @richardalangley Who said I wasn't engaging with issues? The guy is by definition a white supremacist. You rejected that. I corrected your inaccuracy.
929765749090144256 2017-11-12 17:40:03 UTC <benjamin_silver> @elizabethcatte @richardalangley Murray's career is built on an unfounded belief that white people have greater intelligence based on genetics. He's a white supremacist.
929607607966453760 2017-11-11 07:11:39 UTC <benjamin_silver> @GoAngelo @Keurig @patriotpowermom I'm sure they don't mind losing the business of someone who supports pedophiles, you creep.
929606347980787712 2017-11-11 07:06:39 UTC <benjamin_silver> @elizabethcatte @richardalangley Well, he is a white supremacist, so I don't see any problem referring to him as such. In fact, I think it's cowardly not to.
929147296222208001 2017-11-10 00:42:32 UTC <benjamin_silver> @JacobAWohl @locovision The one who was 14 is a Republican. This is another one of the women. That's the thing when you make sexual contact with 4 teenagers when you're over 30. Different stories for each.

929050068556054533 2017-11-10 18:16:11 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AynRandPaulRyan Hate to break this to you: not only is he running, but part of his motivation here is throwing the gauntlet down at Steve Bannon's feet.

928289940143820800 2017-11-08 15:55:43 UTC <benjamin_silver> @craignewman I especially loved one of the stooges telling us that Gillespie lost because he embraced the monuments. Six in ten voters yesterday oppose removal. It's like these toads have never stepped foot in the state. Oh wait, they probably haven't.
928289535682850821 2017-11-08 15:54:06 UTC <benjamin_silver> @WBEZmorning Not sure why you thought having 3 IL GOP would be good for VA election analysis. Blue state? The House hasn't been blue in 20 years. Senate still red.  Especially loved the "Gillespie lost because he embraced monuments." 6/10 in VA OPPOSE REMOVAL!

927314885125595138 2017-11-05 23:21:11 UTC <benjamin_silver> Remember when Trump didn't call Cuomo and Schumer in the aftermath of the recent NY attack?https://twitter.com/ABC/status/927306834154844162

927261699710816256 2017-11-05 19:49:51 UTC <benjamin_silver> @GregAbbott_TX @FoxNews Surely prayers will work this time. Isn't it about time for Trump to tweet about a deranged animal?

926595216836096001 2017-11-03 23:41:29 UTC <benjamin_silver> @elizabethforma @TPM @joshtpm @burrovago It's exactly what you would expect in a JFA and limited to general election, as expected. Donna lied.
926583700418170880 2017-11-03 22:55:43 UTC <benjamin_silver> @goldengateblond @h8socialmedia97 Another misleading article. Buried in there is the fact that it only applied to general election.
926573422712418309 2017-11-03 22:14:53 UTC <benjamin_silver> Dear @donnabrazile I hope your book fails and you never work again.https://twitter.com/aseitzwald/status/926565766522171392

926502709775228929 2017-11-03 17:33:54 UTC <benjamin_silver> @TPM @joshtpm Thank you, Josh. It's a crying shame that @elizabethforma didn't think this through before throwing Hillary and her supporters under the bus
926201379458355203 2017-11-02 21:36:31 UTC <benjamin_silver> @tomwatson This all seems like a coordinated response to Perez's recent DNC moves. Just when I thought we had our party back from non-Dems...
926172358251044865 2017-11-02 19:41:12 UTC <benjamin_silver> @KamalaHarris And they're trying to legislate away women's rights in this bill!https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/926148279221579776
926154216686661633 2017-11-02 18:29:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @HillaryClinton @donnabrazile @TalbertSwan She's selling her book. Bernie signed the same damn Joint Fundraising Agreement. Brazile is a liar.
926144598895980551 2017-11-02 17:50:53 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mattyglesias Great way to get 8 years of Trump.
926120027128061952 2017-11-02 16:13:15 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AltRockyNPS That's not fair  to Wal-Mart greeters.
926103016104656896 2017-11-02 15:05:39 UTC <benjamin_silver> @jbouie @blandphilosophy It pisses me off, too, but it's a binary choice about who is in charge of redistricting.
926094560601796609 2017-11-02 14:32:03 UTC <benjamin_silver> It's almost like Trump is a white supremacist or something...https://twitter.com/CAPAction/status/925813871436271616
925936591234916354 2017-11-01 04:04:21 UTC <benjamin_silver> @daveweigel I don't buy this. Seems like when people say negative ads backfire. We know many of them don't follow that.

925416140125409285 2017-10-31 17:36:15 UTC <benjamin_silver> @JoyAnnReid I think the interviews are not as Chief of Staff, but as CEO of Donald Day Care.
925406094289235968 2017-10-31 16:56:20 UTC <benjamin_silver> @kurteichenwald No, that's not a huge number. I'm as hopeful as anyone. But nearly 1/3 of indictments in that court this year are currently sealed.

919355541977206784 2017-10-14 00:13:36 UTC <benjamin_silver> @MarkLazerus @bluestarboy709 Yeah, far from perfect. I don't buy short suspensions when third and fourth liners take out star players. Make it hurt, they won't do it.
919354163213094912 2017-10-14 00:08:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @MarkLazerus @bluestarboy709 It may be rare, but it's entirely unnecessary. League should police the game, then no need for enforcers or fights.
919352400594505728 2017-10-14 00:01:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @MarkLazerus @bluestarboy709 Well, no word on concussion, but looks like Hayden broke his face.http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/ct-john-hayden-marcus-foligno-fight-blackhawks-20171014-story.html
919342578276929536 2017-10-14 23:22:05 UTC <benjamin_silver> @MarkLazerus @bluestarboy709 Yeah I do. Clean punch. Higher incidence of concussions elsewhere doesn't mean shouldn't eliminate something that causes them less often.
919308350516613121 2017-10-14 21:06:05 UTC <benjamin_silver> @MarkLazerus @bluestarboy709 I don't think they have agency. More than they used to. But certain guys are expected to fight. And that punch probably caused concussion.

917791374199713793 2017-10-10 16:38:10 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SarahSpain @whatsdafus @bflex1985 Part of the reason. Part. Numbers are seasonally adjusted. September was a terrible month for jobs even accounting for hurricanes.
917791163729444864 2017-10-10 16:37:19 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SarahSpain @whatsdafus @bflex1985 I'm not going to do your research for you. The unemployment rate routinely falls below 4.2% when the economy is strong for an extended time.
917789068905283584 2017-10-10 16:29:00 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SarahSpain @whatsdafus @bflex1985 But it is a lot lower, thanks to a record streak of job growth under President Obama... which just ended under Trump.
917788972235018240 2017-10-10 16:28:37 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SarahSpain @whatsdafus @bflex1985 That's the nature of "all time highs" and the trajectory of an industrialized economy. And unemployment is not at an all time low.
917773889203331074 2017-10-10 15:28:41 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SarahSpain @whatsdafus ...which has been the case under every president since Carter.
917762339482386433 2017-10-10 14:42:47 UTC <benjamin_silver> @WSJ @SenJohnMcCain The rule was not implemented so the idea that this is an example of "giving the economy a boost" is pure hogwash.

914896317226405889 2017-10-02 16:54:14 UTC <benjamin_silver> @lisatozzi Not a word about terrorism. Meanwhile, he jumped on the London attack and called out "loser terrorists" without any information.
914873330146185216 2017-10-02 15:22:54 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mindyfinn It would also help if he meant any of it. I'll never be impressed by his cold reading of a teleprompter.
914873158531940352 2017-10-02 15:22:13 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mindyfinn Give me a break. It would be if he didn't spew vitriol after every shooting involving a suspect of color. "Loser terrorists" after London.

908941298782150656 2017-09-15 06:31:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SophiaLeeHyun @Schickrateez It was a violent right wing extremist that massacred churchgoers in Charleston. A violent right wing extremist who murdered children in OKC.

908526372607414272 2017-09-14 03:02:21 UTC <benjamin_silver> @allahpundit That's not what they are chanting. "REJECT violence." I think it's stupid to try and shut Shapiro down, for the record.
908525902702743553 2017-09-14 03:00:29 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SophiaLeeHyun They are chanting "REJECT violence," not "speech is violence." You heard what you wanted to hear.

908397276116209665 2017-09-14 18:29:22 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mattyglesias Maybe for Johnson. Maybe for other legislators. Never for Trump. He described the physical object again and again.
908031065956200452 2017-09-13 18:14:11 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ddiamond Never thought of raising debt ceiling and funding disaster relief as part of pres. agenda. But more concrete than anything else Trump has.
907855411134566400 2017-09-12 06:36:11 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Hustle_Scholar @_MarcTheGOAT Sure thing. There's the housing discrimination in the 70s. The Central Park. The support for violent white supremacists last month.

888704888363986944 2017-07-22 10:18:51 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SouthwestAir After two hours, we finally spoke with an agent. It turns out you rebooked us on a later flight... AND NEVER TOLD US! No email, text, etc.
888682030338363392 2017-07-22 08:48:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SouthwestAir It's now almost 4. There is a single agent rebooking all the canceled flights. We've been waiting here HOURS since you canceled.

880576485144264705 2017-06-29 23:59:29 UTC <benjamin_silver> @FedcourtJunkie @SkylerCFelix SCOTUS didn't lift the stay. SCOTUS lifted only part of the stay. Trump admin is about to go beyond that.
879559580950417409 2017-06-26 04:38:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @spectatorcitizn That said, Oregon is shining example of why automatic voter registration must be the future.
879559481960615937 2017-06-26 04:38:16 UTC <benjamin_silver> @spectatorcitizn It matters, but unfortunately I don't think it matters 22k in Wisco. Remember Oregon is all mail in ballots. And opt out vs. opt in is big.
879557842835001344 2017-06-26 04:31:45 UTC <benjamin_silver> @spectatorcitizn You think 22k missed registering on http://healthcare.gov, decided not to register before or on Election Day, but would have voted?
879557463720251392 2017-06-26 04:30:15 UTC <benjamin_silver> @spectatorcitizn ...in a state where you can walk into the polling place, register, and cast a ballot on Election Day.
879556618278535169 2017-06-26 04:26:53 UTC <benjamin_silver> @spectatorcitizn That's a fair assessment. Don't think it mattered in WI though - they have e-day registration. Active GOP voter suppression far outweighs.
879553676624490501 2017-06-26 04:15:12 UTC <benjamin_silver> @spectatorcitizn Which is not the same as removing it, which is what you claimed. As I said, it should comply with NVRA and doesn't. But it's still there.
879552469050806272 2017-06-26 04:10:24 UTC <benjamin_silver> @spectatorcitizn The state sites must all still comply with NVRA as well (and do).
879552106306428929 2017-06-26 04:08:58 UTC <benjamin_silver> @spectatorcitizn Should the website meeting NVRA requirements? Absolutely. But your premise is a complete lie.
879551998357630976 2017-06-26 04:08:32 UTC <benjamin_silver> @spectatorcitizn Read the damn article you used to cite this. http://Healthcare.gov absolutely offers voter registration.
879350919602765825 2017-06-26 14:49:31 UTC <benjamin_silver> @goldengateblond That's very misleading description of it. Travel ban still blocked as to non-citizens w/ relations to persons in US. That's most plaintiffs.

860586902524702725 2017-05-05 20:08:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Trump__Girl At least you admit you're a wannabe murderer. Far worse than the innocent students.
860544749937324032 2017-05-05 17:20:31 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Corrynmb @CudaDebbie That's one of the looser state laws and probably should be changed, but we evaluate crimes under the law as it is.
860544592034353152 2017-05-05 17:19:53 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Corrynmb @CudaDebbie That is entirely untrue. Consent laws vary by state. In MD a 14 year old can consent as long as partner not more than 4 years older.
860541834203934721 2017-05-05 17:08:56 UTC <benjamin_silver> @LoveUSADawn @stpepina Methinks you don't care very much about laws and justice.
860535157236920320 2017-05-05 16:42:24 UTC <benjamin_silver> I generally agree but that's current law in MD. General age of consent 16 but 14&up can consent as long as partner no more than 4 yrs older.
860522157897641984 2017-05-05 15:50:44 UTC <benjamin_silver> @KenShepherd Yeah, that seems out of line with other states. One of male students is still charged with child porn for pictures he has of female student.
860521382085525505 2017-05-05 15:47:39 UTC <benjamin_silver> @KenShepherd Maryland has an exception for anyone age 14 or older if partner is no more than 4 years older.
860520294418612224 2017-05-05 15:43:20 UTC <benjamin_silver> @LoveUSADawn By "covering up" you mean following the evidence that proved it wasn't a forcible rape. Just clarifying for you.
860515310205644800 2017-05-05 15:23:32 UTC <benjamin_silver> @thetigerlily16 They did not forcibly rape her. The evidence shows that. You did not read the story.
860512462231261186 2017-05-05 15:12:13 UTC <benjamin_silver> @thetigerlily16 Maybe try reading the story so that you aren't accusing people of crimes they didn't commit? Evidence contradicts the original story.
860512068964941828 2017-05-05 15:10:39 UTC <benjamin_silver> @wbaltv11 I'm sure the White House will be quick to retract its hateful rhetoric now.

850175678247034880 2017-04-06 02:37:31 UTC <benjamin_silver> @IllegibleSmudge @shadihamid No, burden of proof is usually on the people aiming to kill a bunch of other people.

848053739265159168 2017-03-31 06:05:42 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Chicago_Scanner @lweber I saw a tweet that said they crashed a stolen car. Whoops.
848052825846423554 2017-03-31 06:02:04 UTC <benjamin_silver> @lweber @Chicago_Scanner There was a third chopper up about 10 minutes ago. And at least a couple are still buzzing around now. More suspects?
848052511386861568 2017-03-31 06:00:49 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Chicago_Scanner @AllNAwe They reportedly got both. Suspects jumped in the river, police boat eventually got them. Still choppers out there though...
848039503977754625 2017-03-31 05:09:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @cordula_owen @CWBChicago On foot? Cops driving up and down alleys on east side of river too.
848037056643309568 2017-03-31 04:59:24 UTC <benjamin_silver> @revdave Cop SUV also rolled down the alley behind Eastwood 10 minutes ago. Chopper drifting north.
848035765888090113 2017-03-31 04:54:16 UTC <benjamin_silver> @revdave Looked the they shot up the river, looped just north of Lawrence, then back by the river at Montrose.

831261743393406980 2017-02-13 22:00:18 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Taniel True that they weren't present, but Reaves-Harris was in the hospital from what I recall, so Dems were never going to hit 71 alone.
830809201421275140 2017-02-12 16:02:03 UTC <benjamin_silver> @realDonaldTrump @kenklippenstein She did not steal anyone's identity. She used fake SSN to get work. Huge difference.

830144897306988545 2017-02-10 20:02:21 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Jordanfabian Nice of President Bannon to let Trump's family ride along.
830144724497481740 2017-02-10 20:01:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ZekeJMiller Wait, aren't the blades usually spinning? Did Trump actually order them to stop to preserve his... hair?

829123332813492224 2017-02-07 00:23:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @RVAwonk He's officially a cyber security adviser to Trump. Statements that show discriminatory intent of gov't allowed in.
829122279309266944 2017-02-07 00:18:50 UTC <benjamin_silver> @RVAwonk Not very difficult considering his role in administration. Comments of officials admissible in civil rights cases.

823721570451525632 2017-01-23 02:38:21 UTC <benjamin_silver> .@nycsouthpaw Less than 48 hrs in, Trump spent the morning watching Conway spar on NBC then called Pence to gush about her performance. Wow.

809855435301855232 2016-12-16 20:19:16 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Green_Footballs Obama is wrong to suggest that. Stop leading people on. Trump will never change. Stop giving him more leash.
809789041248010240 2016-12-16 15:55:27 UTC <benjamin_silver> @crinnnnnn You should probably pin this Tweet.

809401486438502400 2016-12-15 14:15:26 UTC <benjamin_silver> @realDonaldTrump @peterdaou Mitch McConnell made sure he couldn't do it politically. And now his wife will be in Trump's cabinet.
809166686662299648 2016-12-14 22:42:26 UTC <benjamin_silver> @nycsouthpaw Sounds tame compared to just about everything we've heard from the right this year. But they're delicate snowflakes over there.
809157983808745472 2016-12-14 22:07:51 UTC <benjamin_silver> @JeffreyGuterman Uhhh I'm gonna go ahead and guess that was intentional. And it really describes a lot about this election.
809149424156950529 2016-12-14 21:33:50 UTC <benjamin_silver> @JeffZillgitt @Graham_Couch The NBA has the least competitive pro regular season - by far. No parity and over half the teams make playoffs.
809147174999166976 2016-12-14 21:24:54 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mmurraypolitics I mean, there's also the fact that Sanders still isn't a Democrat.
809144658538463233 2016-12-14 21:14:54 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Greg_Palast @JamesManniello @JamiaStarheart @arlethapappas @Sea_Stories You call it "usurpation of democracy" I call it winning by 4M votes
809139403344007169 2016-12-14 20:54:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> As I said, looks like you don't even know the definition of free speech.
809137664599486464 2016-12-14 20:47:06 UTC <benjamin_silver> @yashar Shame on the rest of the tech companies for showing up to this child's conflict of intere- I mean meeting.
808778654025191425 2016-12-13 21:00:32 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Noahbierman That's a MetroBus. We all hate the bus.
808747661176225793 2016-12-13 18:57:22 UTC <benjamin_silver> @realDonaldTrump @RumsfeldOffice You're a war criminal.
807690140915269638 2016-12-10 20:55:10 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ABCPolitics I wonder if Trump voters will ever admit publicly that they were duped by an orange con man.
807444564072169472 2016-12-09 04:39:20 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ginisimov Congrats on the regular season overtime win. I'm sure Rangers' 3 on 3 dominance will help finally beat the annual playoff choke.
807439402427383808 2016-12-09 04:18:49 UTC <benjamin_silver> @realDonaldTrump @politico @AltRightRaptor Far more difficult on average for them to vote on Election Day.
807438199459037185 2016-12-09 04:14:02 UTC <benjamin_silver> @realDonaldTrump @politico @AltRightRaptor It's 34 states. Another 3 are all vote by mail. Sorry you don't like lower income voters.
807421552035856385 2016-12-09 03:07:53 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ginisimov I, too, believe everything I read on the internet. Turns out Torterella is just 4 midgets standing on each others' shoulders.

806588256431312896 2016-12-07 19:56:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @mmurraypolitics Elections have consequences but 2.5 million more voted for Clinton. The consequence? Lack of democratic representation.

804687413863968768 2016-12-02 14:03:24 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ABCPolitics Not "claim," ABC. It's called a lie.
804670176419520512 2016-12-02 12:54:54 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Chris_arnade What Trump did was offer to wave his magic wand. Carrier deal is just that: hocus pocus. Reality: it's terrible economics.
804669791722151942 2016-12-02 12:53:23 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Chris_arnade That's just not true. The media loves that narrative. But it ignored things like federal retraining programs.
804088410084352000 2016-11-30 22:23:10 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Carrier @frankthorp So to be clear, Trump bribed Carrier to temporarily keep less than half the jobs in the US.
803757145321680898 2016-11-29 00:26:51 UTC <benjamin_silver> @sahilkapur Sad to see Sandy step back, but I'm sure he knows as well as anyone that we need to elevate younger leaders.
803756226886696960 2016-11-29 00:23:12 UTC <benjamin_silver> Trump is fulfilling his promise to #DrainTheSwamp by filling it with used diapers and tampons.

802556629468270593 2016-11-26 16:56:25 UTC <benjamin_silver> @nbcchicago This guy has more conflicts of interest than a South American dictator. Get it over with and impeach him.

798377066483818496 2016-11-14 04:08:20 UTC <benjamin_silver> @MrCraw4D He was also over 20 years younger than her when he ran. Not exactly a fair comparison. And her surrogates were in those places.

797843243316744192 2016-11-13 16:47:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ABCPolitics Trump isn't bringing their jobs back. Their jobs don't exist anymore. He sold them a lie.
797545923488399361 2016-11-12 21:05:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @MattOrtega And they say the media helped Clinton. Ha! Any of Trump's scandals sinks anyone else. Media normalized him every step of the way

797291788621008896 2016-11-11 04:15:50 UTC <benjamin_silver> @MarkLazerus Garbage way for that game to end.

796809309694947329 2016-11-10 20:18:38 UTC <benjamin_silver> .@sahilkapur @MoveOn @keithellison Very reasonable. But 50-state can't ignore Blue Dogs in red states. We disparage them at our own peril.
796786262363557889 2016-11-10 18:47:03 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ShaunKing I'm fucking livid over this.
796718668159844352 2016-11-10 14:18:27 UTC <benjamin_silver> @peterdaou It's all Hillary's fault for being a woman and having the media buy every unsubstantiated false attack on her for last 30 years.
796709253180428289 2016-11-10 13:41:02 UTC <benjamin_silver> @scottwoodssays @Jimmyspolitics @Rooz739 Right, because Bernie Sanders was going to get POC out to vote at Obama levels.
796563730620383233 2016-11-09 04:02:47 UTC <benjamin_silver> @chrislhayes @DanaHoule Exits should probably be ignored entirely. Especially in a year where minority voters feared widespread intimidation
796426662980227072 2016-11-09 18:58:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SamPackardNBA @danpfeiffer @PWellz Oh horseshit. You think white blue collar workers who refused to vote HRC would vote Jewish socialist?
796369971400101889 2016-11-09 15:12:51 UTC <benjamin_silver> @donnabrazile I love you, Donna, but fuck healing. Did they offer healing the last 8 years?

796036917569720320 2016-11-08 17:09:25 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol That actually concerns me. Gotta keep those people in line.
796011260349390848 2016-11-08 15:27:28 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol I don't have pictures since I was busy observing, but long lines to start the day in 5 of 6 Milwaukee sites I visited.
795938618674151424 2016-11-08 10:38:49 UTC <benjamin_silver> @weh8hillary Since when are sunglasses clear, you deplorable little brat? Have a nice day today!
795839265875881984 2016-11-07 04:04:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ForecasterEnten I'm not a Bills fan, but that whole sequence was embarrassing for the NFL.

794883782469943301 2016-11-05 12:47:16 UTC <benjamin_silver> @NoahGrayCNN Trump visiting NV the day after early voting closes. It's almost like he doesn't have a clue.
794648748236410881 2016-11-04 21:13:20 UTC <benjamin_silver> @RalstonReports Holy moly. That 70k mark is looking like a real possibility.
794645121300107264 2016-11-04 20:58:55 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @Fakten_und_Zahl Of course. Everyone knows Zia nailed it in 2012. http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nm/new_mexico_romney_vs_obama-2027.html
794623798259707904 2016-11-04 19:34:11 UTC <benjamin_silver> I'm pretty convinced you're a bot. That's a solid non sequitur, deplorabot.
794622219976605697 2016-11-04 19:27:55 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers Gee, 82% landline, IVR, and it found millennials support Trump over Clinton? No problem there. LOL
794614020137435136 2016-11-04 18:55:20 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @pinocalub About half or more of all ballots are cast early in FL/NC. Most vote on election day in PA/NH.
794612339924406272 2016-11-04 18:48:39 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @pinocalub Because there's no/limited early voting in both those states.
794606419559481344 2016-11-04 18:25:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @marlins360 You should learn the definition of sexual assault. Please teach it to your son so he doesn't end up like Trump.
794601376382877697 2016-11-04 18:05:05 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @marlins360 No, I have never bragged about sexually assaulting women. Have you?
794599729439113216 2016-11-04 17:58:33 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @marlins360 Oh ok. You'd rather the man who brags about sexual assault, screws honest workers, and is cavalier about nukes.
794585814348992512 2016-11-04 17:03:15 UTC <benjamin_silver> @hollybdc I get the impression that this isn't uncommon. Yet another reason that rally size is a poor indicator of actual voter support.
794579389358936064 2016-11-04 16:37:43 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @marlins360 Yup. Trump is a raging dumpster fire and so are his deplorable followers.

794269177926205440 2016-11-03 20:05:03 UTC <benjamin_silver> @SopanDeb Gee, where's the countdown clock. Where's Fox News and Twitter freaking out about it?
794264954127794176 2016-11-03 19:48:16 UTC <benjamin_silver> @davidshor Please pass that along to the folks at @866OURVOTE. Looks like it violates law without a "paid for."
794241516936003584 2016-11-03 18:15:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ForecasterEnten You'd have to have a job first.

794230342362267648 2016-11-03 17:30:44 UTC <benjamin_silver> @BretBaier @chrisgeidner @StockPuppet Bret Baier's anonymous "sources"? His sources are Rudy Giuliani and putting his ear to Trump's ass.
793910777543413761 2016-11-02 20:20:54 UTC <benjamin_silver> @kevcirilli Just when I thought Trump couldn't get any dumber.
793910525373493248 2016-11-02 20:19:54 UTC <benjamin_silver> @nycsouthpaw 538 needs an overhaul before the next cycle. They're way too reliant on unreliable polls.
793908934708842496 2016-11-02 20:13:34 UTC <benjamin_silver> @librab103 So while not at 2012 level yet, enthusiasm actually picking up if anything.
793908861560176640 2016-11-02 20:13:17 UTC <benjamin_silver> @librab103 The 10% increase is over last 3 days not overall. EV sites shuttered in Guilford Cty (Greensboro) until yesterday.
793907211164532738 2016-11-02 20:06:43 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ForecasterEnten But has anyone unskewed these yet?
793906635454328833 2016-11-02 20:04:26 UTC <benjamin_silver> @librab103 I'll see if I can track down numbers, but that's Obama's '12 Field Director, so he would definitely have the numbers.
793904238120210432 2016-11-02 19:54:55 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @librab103 Except almost everywhere there's early voting. E.g.https://twitter.com/jeremybird/status/793866260538757120
793903312793784320 2016-11-02 19:51:14 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @librab103 That would be a lot more noteworthy if the election was in December. She doesn't need FL and OH. He needs NC/PA.
793823762072367104 2016-11-02 14:35:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @TPM But Trump is up on honesty according to the ABC poll. Thanks, media, for the balanced coverage this cycle. We're doomed.
793822652372774912 2016-11-02 14:30:43 UTC <benjamin_silver> @NumbersMuncher Easy. Just get the FBI to go political for the first time in decades, have the media eat it up, and voila.
793538676424712193 2016-11-01 19:42:18 UTC <benjamin_silver> @BraddJaffy Clinton better in every single one of her firewall states.
793496381394518016 2016-11-01 16:54:14 UTC <benjamin_silver> @alivitali Ew, get Trump out of Wawa. It's practically a holy site.
793470479528964096 2016-11-01 15:11:18 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers Garbage. Trump at 25% with both black and Hispanic voters. Same poll had over a quarter of voters undecided two weeks ago.
793167431518662656 2016-10-31 19:07:06 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ZekeJMiller Alberto freaking Gonzales agrees that Comey blew it. Comey needs to resign.
793147984351330304 2016-10-31 17:49:50 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ABC That's the polite way of saying "he's a damn hack."
792428932087816192 2016-10-29 18:12:34 UTC <benjamin_silver> @kevcirilli But it doesn't whatsoever. The Republicans have never had a replacement plan.
791837302037381121 2016-10-27 03:01:39 UTC <benjamin_silver> @outsidethenba @HPbasketball C's on the road at the end of a back to back. I'm a Bulls fan, but that's usually a loss.
791811126300401668 2016-10-27 01:17:38 UTC <benjamin_silver> @_HankRearden Can you point me to that traitor's grave so I can take a leak?
791810482323722240 2016-10-27 01:15:04 UTC <benjamin_silver> @JaredWyand There were arrests in each. Convictions in Ferguson, Baltimore. But your hatred of everything black prevented you from googling.
791669647825309697 2016-10-27 15:55:27 UTC <benjamin_silver> @espn @MarkMizzouSteel Has anyone argued otherwise? The problem is that shirt is objectively uncontroversial and the Sixers are cowards.
791539079318007808 2016-10-27 07:16:37 UTC <benjamin_silver> @nycsouthpaw Ouch, that's gonna leave a mark. The students quoted in the article sound like they'd be fun at parties.
791303389225201672 2016-10-26 15:40:04 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @rjones1974 Over half of 2012 Florida votes were cast early. You're clueless like a good little Trumpkin.
791295832897183745 2016-10-26 15:10:02 UTC <benjamin_silver> @brfreed Yay responsible journalism!
791295567829700609 2016-10-26 15:08:59 UTC <benjamin_silver> @NYTnickc Why is anyone covering this at all?
791289950280953856 2016-10-26 14:46:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @NikRiehle Not goal tending when the ball is below the rim.

790777244390162433 2016-10-24 04:49:21 UTC <benjamin_silver> @always_trump What is it about you deplorables and lying about verifiable information?  https://hillaryspeeches.com/scheduled-events/
790654557529538561 2016-10-24 20:41:50 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ForecasterEnten The opposite was originally a concern among progressives. And affirmative voters less likely to skip on Election Day.
790620716353851394 2016-10-24 18:27:22 UTC <benjamin_silver> @nbcchicago I'll take scientific polls over anything that comes out of Mango Mussolini's bloated face.
790406440762552320 2016-10-23 04:15:55 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Nate_Cohn Here we all are enjoying the worst football game in NFL history and you have to go and ruin our night. JERK!
790394313192595456 2016-10-23 03:27:43 UTC <benjamin_silver> @joshtpm More like typical. Anti-intellectualism is the theme of the year.
790070673263718401 2016-10-22 06:01:41 UTC <benjamin_silver> .@StephenBaldwin7 @nbcsnl What's the chapter and verse for supporting a sexual predator who brags about his crimes?
789974774193778688 2016-10-22 23:40:37 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AdamWeinstein Very true. That's the Trump effect though - not new feelings, just encouraged to come out of the woodwork.
789972212614823936 2016-10-22 23:30:27 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AdamWeinstein I mean, are you really surprised?
789874559168065537 2016-10-22 17:02:24 UTC <benjamin_silver> @davidaxelrod "Grab them by the pussy" Trump
789866168668393472 2016-10-22 16:29:04 UTC <benjamin_silver> @HuffPostPol @pollsterpolls @MeatballMom2 Those rankings only look at final poll of each org. IBD was way off in earlier polls.
789590827483791360 2016-10-21 22:14:57 UTC <benjamin_silver> @JamesOKeefeIII @GuyEndoreKaiser @fatbaby1337 @toomuchnick So Seth was on his way to the FBI at 4am after leaving the bar? GTFO, nutjobs.
789590501154369536 2016-10-21 22:13:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @joshtpm Seth Rich was on his way to meet the FBI at 4am after leaving the bar according to these psychopaths. Trump can't lose fast enough.
788965741458558976 2016-10-19 04:51:05 UTC <benjamin_silver> @billmon1 I think it was a head fake from Wallace to keep Trump from bringing it up. And it worked.
788831584589910016 2016-10-19 19:58:00 UTC <benjamin_silver> @pollsterpolls LOL Stein at 6. She would be extremely lucky to get half that.
788820040208396288 2016-10-19 19:12:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AaronBlake @bakeer59 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueZ6tvqhk8U  The media is under no obligation to devote equal time to unequal stories.
788802402719666176 2016-10-19 18:02:02 UTC <benjamin_silver> @VolviEinhorn Also: http://www.pollster.com/blogs/hitting_a_bullet_with_a_bullet.html
788799966164594688 2016-10-19 17:52:21 UTC <benjamin_silver> @TPM @joshtpm Not a mistake; a dog whistle. He's calling out the deplorables who want to resurrect the Crusades.
788797366371360768 2016-10-19 17:42:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @billmon1 Brock would probably take that first part as a compliment.
788790375422885888 2016-10-19 17:14:15 UTC <benjamin_silver> @VolviEinhorn I think it's just a bad sample. Stein at 6 right now is incredibly unrealistic.
788786155143565312 2016-10-19 16:57:28 UTC <benjamin_silver> @nycsouthpaw @thegarance Gosh, this is going to really hurt Bill Clinton's chances of winning the presidency.
788158402685988864 2016-10-17 23:23:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> That's quite the strange looking cat. Looks an awful lot like a trash panda to me.
788062119304372224 2016-10-17 17:00:25 UTC <benjamin_silver> @DevinNunes @jasoninthehouse @frankthorp Chaffetz's mischaracterization of what Under Secretary Kennedy did is far more reckless.
788052198643015680 2016-10-17 16:21:00 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Nate_Cohn Easy: ratings. There's a debate Wednesday after all.
788049650683039745 2016-10-17 16:10:52 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Nate_Cohn Targeting a House district? Texas 23rd?
788042624879820800 2016-10-17 15:42:57 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Nate_Cohn This forces Trump to spend money in AZ.
788026996722798592 2016-10-17 14:40:51 UTC <benjamin_silver> @pollsterpolls Not you, too, Razzie! What will Mango Mussolini point to now?!
787065200868372480 2016-10-14 22:59:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @WDFx2EU7 By "witness" you mean camera-seeking self-proclaimed sex trafficker who puts Trump w/ witness despite Trump claim they never met
787062649523621889 2016-10-14 22:48:53 UTC <benjamin_silver> @TrumpNewss Trump's "witness" is a self-proclaimed child sex trafficker.
787021688093417473 2016-10-14 20:06:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers If you keep posting push-polls, people will unfollow. Read the first question.
786985527371333632 2016-10-14 17:42:25 UTC <benjamin_silver> @RABAresearch @PpollingNumbers @wazzucoug99 @almaddox93 @BarneyRuffles According to one poll. Two exits had 60/40.
786967454090010624 2016-10-14 16:30:36 UTC <benjamin_silver> @RABAresearch @PpollingNumbers @wazzucoug99 @almaddox93 lol no. Those are nearly identical to Obama 2012. That's a terrible sign for Trump.
786350140835508224 2016-10-12 23:37:37 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AaronBlake Bring it on. Trump is self-destructing, and it will affect far more than just his campaign. His brand is now a dumpster fire.
784979847235928064 2016-10-08 04:52:34 UTC <benjamin_silver> @nia4_trump Yeah, the entire establishment totally shoved Trump in a time machine and made him say all those things.
784866995959435264 2016-10-08 21:24:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol @Taniel Add John McCain to rescinded support! Bwahahaha

782606389206196224 2016-10-02 15:41:17 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers I guess they don't teach statistics in TrumpaLumpaLand

773370626711007232 2016-09-06 04:01:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AshleyRParker Trump is a fascist through and through.
771814444947148800 2016-09-02 20:57:57 UTC <benjamin_silver> @brokerbev1 @Matt_Mollinedo @MartinS7504 Considering neither of those polls has bilingual surveys and this one does, I'll go with this one.
771206222330466304 2016-08-31 04:41:06 UTC <benjamin_silver> @becket Considering Healy's history this cycle, every reason to believe he's responsible.
771201372767129600 2016-08-31 04:21:50 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ConnieSchultz Thought this may be of interest. https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/771192259798708224
768457354568499200 2016-08-24 14:38:05 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers Trump at 20% black and 40% Hispanic? I have a bridge to sell you...
765748229442899968 2016-08-16 03:12:59 UTC <benjamin_silver> @JaredWyand Internet David Duke-wannabe tells blacks to vote for man guilty of housing discrimination #NationalTellAJokeDay
765408641788829696 2016-08-15 04:43:35 UTC <benjamin_silver> @theScore Gotta love the know-it-alls that were totally all over diving through the finish in 2008: https://youtu.be/JLaVIPlPm6g
764879619208118272 2016-08-14 17:41:26 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @FanLeafz Only if one doesn't understand statistics.
763850189400633345 2016-08-11 21:30:51 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ForecasterEnten Hillary has of course done nothing the last two weeks that should have brought favorability down. Backwards and in heels.
763790763612368896 2016-08-11 17:34:43 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @ScallyWagger01 You're surprisingly insecure about college considering your purported low esteem for education.
763788759464865793 2016-08-11 17:26:45 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @ScallyWagger01 I'd say the candidate calling for assassinations is greater filth, but that because I gave morals.
763788367251267584 2016-08-11 17:25:11 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @ScallyWagger01 Gee, your anecdotal evidence totally statistics. Did you learn that at non-college?
763783189278097409 2016-08-11 17:04:37 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @ScallyWagger01 Knowledge and education = liberal indoctrination. Got it. Reality has a well-known liberal bias.
763782875401580545 2016-08-11 17:03:22 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @CapsExaminer It is true. I can't find the state map at the moment, but here's county:https://mobile.twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/762309563013935104
763772380464418816 2016-08-11 16:21:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ppppolls @PpollingNumbers Three most recent polls have Clinton up double digits in NH.
763771878574006273 2016-08-11 16:19:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers Not too surprising that he's doing OK in Iowa. One of highest percentage non-college white voters.
762365711117410305 2016-08-07 19:12:04 UTC <benjamin_silver> @MikeWiseguy She didn't run out of gas  - the advantage of pack riding is just that great. Heartbreaking.
762343715809660928 2016-08-07 17:44:40 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @northmtnstates @deyokane You of course have at least a scrap of evidence supporting that... Right?
762342949237710848 2016-08-07 17:41:37 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @northmtnstates @deyokane Many are anti-intellectual idiots.
762171955202195456 2016-08-06 06:22:09 UTC <benjamin_silver> @sfcpoll @PostPolls @jude888rl You're right. We should just scrap elections and count the number of people who show up to rallies. Or not.
761708246730088448 2016-08-05 23:39:32 UTC <benjamin_silver> @pollreport So Trump is down 11 in a poll that has Snyder at an absurdly high 40% approval. Wasn't he supposed to challenge in Michigan?
761309641062096896 2016-08-04 21:15:37 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Nate_Cohn @Pretefunkera @RisingSilent The latest CNN poll included under 35; didn't have enough for breakdown. Also only would help Trump.
760731387003625472 2016-08-02 06:57:51 UTC <benjamin_silver> Hey @ppppolls, someone needs to get a Mitt Romney poll in the field. Preferably head to head with Harambe.
760672078638911489 2016-08-02 03:02:10 UTC <benjamin_silver> @realDonaldTrump @KatrinaPierson The Donald's African-American doesn't appear to be in that picture. Sad!
760670897879613440 2016-08-02 02:57:29 UTC <benjamin_silver> @JohnJHarwood @JasonMillerinDC The fact that Trump camp felt a need to respond to this says it all. The wheels have fallen off.

760513755583217664 2016-08-02 16:33:03 UTC <benjamin_silver> @AlGiordano Don't be jealous. The Donald also won the World Series after Curt Schilling gave him a ring.
760288794608361472 2016-08-01 01:39:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ForecasterEnten What is the current probability that Harambe outperforms Jill Stein in November?
759739487039750144 2016-07-31 13:16:23 UTC <benjamin_silver> @PpollingNumbers @Chelseax05 You don't know what correlate means 
755294642925625344 2016-07-18 06:54:10 UTC <benjamin_silver> @DuleHill Great quote, but incorrect attribution. Melania Trump said that. #FamousMelaniaTrumpQuotes

751167409663410176 2016-07-07 21:34:01 UTC <benjamin_silver> @NPR @writingnewman I'm not sure what a "voting block" is, but certain Bernie didn't have most voters in the primary - by about 4 million
740362346632253440 2016-06-07 01:58:33 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ericrhare @benchmarkpol Ahem Larry Sabato would like to have a word with you! ;)
739577522850037760 2016-06-05 21:59:56 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol @joyce_tyler That wasn't an MSNBC numbers guy. It was Bernie's campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, better known as Comic Book Guy.
738204656711684096 2016-06-01 03:04:39 UTC <benjamin_silver> Pavelski/Crosby. It's a night for a captain. #bucciovertimechallenge
735307380083326976 2016-05-24 03:11:55 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol @librab103 That's because Bernie will not be the nominee.
732770385112879104 2016-05-17 03:10:48 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol Marion County is probably an error.
730226295846612992 2016-05-10 02:41:30 UTC <benjamin_silver> @jeremysgarson @benchmarkpol That wasn't 538's benchmark in the sense of @benchmarkpol. 538 projects for a 50/50 national race.
730224207871803392 2016-05-10 02:33:12 UTC <benjamin_silver> @jeremysgarson @benchmarkpol Yes, but those benchmarks were set before Bernie missed his benchmarks by wide margins in many states.
730215822870843392 2016-05-10 01:59:53 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol @dukedevil0 Not just any other! A known felon! https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Russell_Judd

730198834362626049 2016-05-10 00:52:23 UTC <benjamin_silver> @cstreater @benchmarkpol I'm not sure, but 40% voted for a felon over Obama in 2012.
730198129077846016 2016-05-10 00:49:35 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol Is it just me or is Bernie underperforming in Monongalia County? Almost half in and he's "only" at 57%.
725127104204005377 2016-04-26 00:59:08 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol Where do you view results? You seem to have faster results than NYT and CNN.
725122182804836352 2016-04-26 00:39:35 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol What site are these results from? NYT and CNN both seem to be behind and harder to read.

722595407096848384 2016-04-19 01:19:04 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol WOW
722593814284738560 2016-04-19 01:12:45 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol Is that for sure? Isn't it just early precincts?
722592612578934789 2016-04-19 01:07:58 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol Don't know which precincts yet though, no?
722589329722372097 2016-04-19 00:54:55 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol Trump at 61? I call shenanigans. He would be significantly outperforming his polls, which is the opposite of the entire cycle.
722542316926476292 2016-04-19 21:48:07 UTC <benjamin_silver> @Dannnnmannn @benchmarkpol Exits in 2008 also would have been NYC only then, right?
722538624533852162 2016-04-19 21:33:26 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol I don't think it's smart to compare this to earlier states. The race has become far more contentious over the last two weeks.
722527454284365824 2016-04-19 20:49:03 UTC <benjamin_silver> @benchmarkpol Me too, though California Hispanic voters could be far different from New York.

694401345403686912 2016-02-01 06:05:56 UTC <benjamin_silver> @ZerlinaMaxwell Missing as in "outstanding" or missing as in boxes of ballots floating on a lake in Florida?
