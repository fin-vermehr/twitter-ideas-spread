859877851872604160 2017-05-03 21:10:30 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi Like the 24 million people who currently have care and will lose it by 2026? Or the fact seniors can be charged up to 10X more for coverage?
859876865217110016 2017-05-03 21:06:35 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi Why not get all the information about this plan, like wait for the CBO to provide an analysis?Or are you afraid of bad numbers?#OH12

842092714833387520 2017-03-15 19:18:43 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan the "freedom" to go without insurance because it is unaffordable is not freedom at all. For many it is  death sentence.

840573395104329728 2017-03-11 14:41:29 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan your plan will make coverage unaffordable for millions, close rural hospitals, and raise costs for seniors. It is bad policy.
840413098225913856 2017-03-10 04:04:31 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman #ACA has been good for the economy by creating jobs & keep hospitals open in rural areas. Fix ACA, it is good for Ohio.
840351208086876160 2017-03-10 23:58:35 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan if you had a stong commitment to life, u wouldn't be working to take away healthcare from millions of Americans. #Trumpcare
840301393902747649 2017-03-10 20:40:39 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan verified: your refundable tax credits will not cover the cost of healthcare insurance for low income, rural, or older Americans
840300118544941057 2017-03-10 20:35:34 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman #Trumpcare will dramatically raise the cost of health insurance for seniors. Please protect your constituents. #SaveACA
840298902746214406 2017-03-10 20:30:45 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman #Trumpcare would not require mental health and addiction services as part of coverage. It will hurt people fighting addiction
840298245607849984 2017-03-10 20:28:08 UTC <Archmom1> @SenateMajLdr stop pushing alternative facts. Under the Republican plan millions lose care, while rich get a tax break.

839905046301147136 2017-03-09 18:25:42 UTC <Archmom1> Paul Ryan does not understand the nature of the insurance business. All insurance works this way.https://twitter.com/CitizenCohn/status/839884883015118849
839864475368972291 2017-03-09 15:44:29 UTC <Archmom1> @DrPhilRoe @SpeakerRyan Do no harm... Taking away healthcare from millions constitutes harm. Republicans are the death panels.
839824011639074819 2017-03-09 13:03:42 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan your plan will force millions of people to lose coverage. Some of those people will die. Republicans are the death panels!
839821707091271681 2017-03-09 12:54:32 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan @EdgeOfMyTweet and it is terrible for seniors, who will pay much more.
839661294500339712 2017-03-08 02:17:07 UTC <Archmom1> @WaysandMeansGOP @PatTiberi fact: joblock, when people are trapped in a job to keep healthcare is encouraged by the Republican plan
839646402363940865 2017-03-08 01:17:56 UTC <Archmom1> @YouTube @PatTiberi millions will lose coverage under the Republican plan. In rural areas, this is expected 2 lead to more hospital closures

839603298386776064 2017-03-08 22:26:40 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan you plan will cost seniors thousands of dollars more, and cause millions to lose care. U are creating more problems. Save #ACA
839580525367017474 2017-03-08 20:56:10 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi analysis of  Republican plan  predict millions lose coverage, & raise cost for seniors. Your plan creates more problems. Fix #ACA
839551087136878592 2017-03-08 18:59:11 UTC <Archmom1> @SenateMajLdr yes if u keep doing things like trying to kill the advertising & shortening the time to get insurance through exchange #fixACA
839502575632285700 2017-03-08 15:46:25 UTC <Archmom1> @leighlwilk the increase in cost was going up at a higher rate before AC, but continues to be a problem.
839459795455344640 2017-03-08 12:56:26 UTC <Archmom1> @leighlwilk how would you look at it practically?
839456690017796096 2017-03-08 12:44:05 UTC <Archmom1> @leighlwilk but not getting insurance not only affects them. It is predicted more rural hospitals will close as uninsured  rise.
839453781532225536 2017-03-08 12:32:32 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk who is being irresponsible? If a person doesn't have $$ to pay, they have no choice to make.
839453136670584832 2017-03-08 12:29:58 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk do you think insurance companies will decide to lower their prices? Or that pharmaceutical companies?
839452644238319616 2017-03-08 12:28:01 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk sounds like the burden is that insurance is too expensive.
839452398330445826 2017-03-08 12:27:02 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk do you want employees to buy insurance?
839451995421487104 2017-03-08 12:25:26 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk would paying for the full premium put an unfair burden on your employees? Is insurance affordable?
839450724488609792 2017-03-08 12:20:23 UTC <Archmom1> @leighlwilk unfotunately high risk pools as a solution haven't worked. Cost is too high, so again people can't afford insurance. No choice.
839449603535691776 2017-03-08 12:15:56 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk If the cost is too high, how can people make the choice.
839449018413510657 2017-03-08 12:13:36 UTC <Archmom1> @leighlwilk biggest issue is the cost of the product is too high for many to buy.  There is no choice if people can't afford it.
839305138456121344 2017-03-07 02:41:53 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi before ACA rates were increasing at a higher rate. #Trumpcare
839304747882536961 2017-03-07 02:40:20 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi and people will be driving longer distances as the number of rural uninsured rise, and more rural hospitals close  #Republicare
839301256535494656 2017-03-07 02:26:27 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk whose burden will your uninsured employees become?  The governments?
839284311979409408 2017-03-07 01:19:07 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk do you think there is no  need for insurance? Should your employees pay for their own insurance?
839283788626735106 2017-03-07 01:17:03 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk why is the burden unfair?
839283038198591488 2017-03-07 01:14:04 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk have you read plan? It is available.
839282844216225792 2017-03-07 01:13:17 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk ditribution is different. Tax credits won't be sufficient  2 make care affordable. Millions lose care
839281487505686528 2017-03-07 01:07:54 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk that is different issue altogether, not covered in new Republican plan.
839277843947343876 2017-03-07 00:53:25 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk why is it not?
839275182908932097 2017-03-07 00:42:51 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk That is how the insurance business works. All insurance.
839218683713110016 2017-03-07 20:58:20 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk it is cheaper to take care of a small issue than something major.  I will find article when I have time.
839212951923994624 2017-03-07 20:35:34 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi U cound have quotes from OH if you listened to ur constituents when they met w/ u. Cacer survivors who need ACA to stay alive.
839210929627754497 2017-03-07 20:27:32 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk healthy people who pay help pay for sick. More people in plan reduces cost for insurance companies.
839210175126978560 2017-03-07 20:24:32 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk To pay for insurance and not have the coverage you need = poinless
839209534912614400 2017-03-07 20:21:59 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk health crisis is most common cause of bankruptcy. If u make the wrong choice, u gamble w/ financial ruin
839208797222625280 2017-03-07 20:19:03 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk Sure. Buy a plan that is affordable because it doesn't cover prescriptions drugs, & pray u stay healthy.
839208004281061377 2017-03-07 20:15:54 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi Pam will get the chance to lose her care along with 15 to 20 million other Americans. #Tiberi(doesnt)Care
839207219099013120 2017-03-07 20:12:47 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk the ACA had plenty of problems. New pkan doesn't make things better for most. Rich do get big tax break
839206814487040000 2017-03-07 20:11:10 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk Ohio saved over a billion dollars by providing preventative care through ACA.
839206555727855623 2017-03-07 20:10:09 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk it morally wrong to turn away a person from emergency care. Wise use of $= preventative care.
839205117631025154 2017-03-07 20:04:26 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk the only way to bring down cost is for all prople to be covered. We pay more that the rest of the world
839204617560936448 2017-03-07 20:02:27 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk Obviously this government does not have a clue. Most people want affordable health care.
839204124717625344 2017-03-07 20:00:29 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk In new plan seniors will pay about 2-3 thousand dollars more.
839167400151035905 2017-03-07 17:34:33 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk cheaper coverage will be available, but it will cover less, leaving people vulnerable to financial ruin.
839166951318515713 2017-03-07 17:32:46 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk these include maternity care, prescription coverage, mental health and addiction services.
839166533414846465 2017-03-07 17:31:07 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk the big 10 areas of coverage required of ACA insurance companies will be gone
839165538228187140 2017-03-07 17:27:09 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk seniors will also pay more. ACA protections limiting cost hikes 4 seniors means rates will go up.
839164937335410688 2017-03-07 17:24:46 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk but the uninsured will continue 2 need care, so emergency room usage will go up, driving up cost for all
839164283309150212 2017-03-07 17:22:10 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @leighlwilk with the subsidies gone, it is estimated 15 to 20  million Americans will lose care.
839158185076396032 2017-03-07 16:57:56 UTC <Archmom1> @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr tax break for rich, millions lose insurance, we pay more and get less, seniors pay more = #Rupublicans(don't)Care
839155942746914816 2017-03-07 16:49:02 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan the "choice" to go without insurance because we can't afford it, while rich get a massive tax break = Republican Trumpcare.
839137315289251840 2017-03-07 15:35:01 UTC <Archmom1> @SenateMajLdr more people are insured in Kentucky than ever before. But you are trying to change that. You are the death panel. Shameful!
839136366403465216 2017-03-07 15:31:14 UTC <Archmom1> @SenateMajLdr Trump said we wouldn't lose their coverage, & we get better coverage. Your plan has millions lose care, and pay more for less.
839119968142766080 2017-03-07 14:26:05 UTC <Archmom1> If you aren't rich,and you become seriously ill, you will have the freedom to choose between financial ruin or death. Don't you LOVE choices
839118645355757568 2017-03-07 14:20:49 UTC <Archmom1> Only a person who has never had to  worry about healthcare or about paying bills for serious medical treatment could say something so dumb.https://twitter.com/politico/status/839117326830174209
839105113931321344 2017-03-07 13:27:03 UTC <Archmom1> @EdWorkforce @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP rich get a tax break, the rest of Americans either lose care, lose benefits, & pay more. Terrible plan!
839103155690405891 2017-03-07 13:19:16 UTC <Archmom1> @SenateMajLdr millions will lose care, rural hospitals will close,  Americans will pay more & get less, & the rich get tax break. Awful plan
838948025728909312 2017-03-06 03:02:50 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan millions lose care, those with care pay more and receive less, destroy Medicaid, and provide generous tax savings for rich.
838923957126463488 2017-03-06 01:27:12 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman your constituents want to meet with you. Please  hold a Town Hall.

838885324742877185 2017-03-06 22:53:41 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman without #ACA  we are all vulnerable, just 1 scary diagnosis away from financial ruin. Ban lifetime spending caps!
838883856178638848 2017-03-06 22:47:51 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman thank you. Loss of healthcare is bad for Americans, bad for economy. Ohio has saved millions by providing preventative care.
838840531493007360 2017-03-06 19:55:42 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan the majority of Americans oppose leaving millions without healthcare. It is bad for Americans, it is bad for the economy. #ACA

838780465997877249 2017-03-06 15:57:01 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman How many people will we miss because they will no longer have access to healthcare? #ACA saves lives.
838762380230332416 2017-03-06 14:45:09 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan you support entitlements for corporations and the rich. It is regular Americans who will lose care, pay more, and get less #ACA
838535873033547780 2017-03-05 23:45:06 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman how do u feel about the millions we r paying for Trump to travel 2 Florida almost every weekend, while $ for L. Erie is gone?
838530417988939776 2017-03-05 23:23:25 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman we need to know that there are no conflicts of interest in the White House. Demand a release of Trump's taxes.
838529606034550784 2017-03-05 23:20:11 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman we need an independent investigation of the Russian interference in the last election, independent of Congress and politics.
838024205929185280 2017-03-04 13:51:55 UTC <Archmom1> Recently reread Animal Farm. Now when I see Trump blaming Obama all I see Napoleon blaming Snowball.  #AnimalFarm
837871414141157376 2017-03-03 03:44:46 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan @Lizjspriggs they need to fix it, not take care away from 20 million people. New plan covers less people,& cost patients more.
837819962475470849 2017-03-03 00:20:19 UTC <Archmom1> @POTUS @SpeakerRyan tax break for rich, millions lose insurance, elderly pay more, high risk pools that don't work: no wonder ur hiding it!

837788559784443905 2017-03-03 22:15:32 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan There are more people with insurance than ever before! Fix the weakness in #ACA, don't be the death panel that takes care away.
837761857066790912 2017-03-03 20:29:26 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman thank you. It is critical to speak out against hatred and intolerance.

837708931455660032 2017-03-03 16:59:07 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman the cost of health insurance could go up significantly ($6000 per year) for seniors if #ACA is repealed. Improve don't repeal
837707339910234114 2017-03-03 16:52:48 UTC <Archmom1> @SenateMajLdr Kentucky has more people with health insurance than ever before because of ACA. How many of ur constituents will u sacrifice?

837491069747081216 2017-03-02 02:33:25 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan Will the new plan give the rich a big tax break, while the poor lose care? Trump promised lower prices for drugs, do u deliver?
837489780011171840 2017-03-02 02:28:18 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan Will it provide protections for people with preexisting conditions? Will it ban lifetime speding caps like #ACA ?
837489140123979778 2017-03-02 02:25:45 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan then show us the plan. Will it provide coverage for more people? Will it keep the big 10 benefits from ACA? Is it affordable?
837485730494615553 2017-03-02 02:12:12 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman #ACA requires insurance 2 cover mental health and addiction services. If repealed, these services could dissappear. #SaveACA

837296903524126720 2017-03-02 13:41:52 UTC <Archmom1> @POTUS @SenateMajLdr middle class hates clean air and water as much as they hate having health care?
837123989034127361 2017-03-01 02:14:46 UTC <Archmom1> The more active I become in our political process, the more I want to see women in positions of power. #WomensHistoryMonth
837119047200276480 2017-03-01 01:55:08 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP give us details. We are tired of meaningless buzz words. Our lives depend on affordable, accessible health care#ACA
837116148734885889 2017-03-01 01:43:37 UTC <Archmom1> @POTUS @SpeakerRyan I think you ment to say "empowering corporations." They are the ones with the bright future, not regular Americans.
837115489230913536 2017-03-01 01:41:00 UTC <Archmom1> @POTUS @SenateMajLdr even Russia is in on this! #Trumprussia #IndependentInvestigation
837069321457192960 2017-03-01 22:37:32 UTC <Archmom1> @POTUS @SenateMajLdr Russia meddled with our election, this is a national security threat.#independentnvestigation #Trumprussia
837066695189626880 2017-03-01 22:27:06 UTC <Archmom1> @JoAnn_Jenkins @AARP @senrobportman did u discuss how seniors could see a significant cost increase on health insurance if #ACA is repealed?
837055359399395328 2017-03-01 21:42:04 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman Russia does't play by the rules. Demand an investigation  of Russian interference with US affairs.#Trumprussia
836940790899355648 2017-03-01 14:06:48 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi when #Russia meddles with US affairs, and u refuse an independent investigation, our national security is compromised. Shameful!
836938203361849344 2017-03-01 13:56:31 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman talking about working together is easy, u refuse to even meet with constituents u label as Dems. Your words are hollow.
836785000464977921 2017-02-28 03:47:45 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi please protect your constituents, THOUSANDS will lose health care if ACA is repealed. Improve don't repeal #ACA
836775279817342984 2017-02-28 03:09:07 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan keep on standing by Russia Paul. Keep pretending our security has not been compromised.
836774320923901952 2017-02-28 03:05:19 UTC <Archmom1> @GOPLeader @SpeakerRyan @POTUS  We can "choose" to without healthcare if we can't afford it. We can "choose" to pay more for less. #ACA

836738021122838529 2017-02-28 00:41:04 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman thank you for speaking up. For many of us these are scary times. Hate crimes are up. America's promise feels threatened.
836725094621773825 2017-02-28 23:49:42 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman I am not optimistic. When u silence your constituents,  u hurt democracy. Why are you unwilling to hold a #TownHall ?
836723160934412289 2017-02-28 23:42:01 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman why don't you seize the opportunity to listen to ALL your constituents? A town hall is democracy in action. #TownHall #OH12
836722078791397376 2017-02-28 23:37:43 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman listening to ALL your constituents, by holding a town hall would demonstrate a willingness to bring people together.  #OH12
836666774053597184 2017-02-28 19:57:58 UTC <Archmom1> @SenateMajLdr it's not Democrats, its people who now have access to lifesaving care, regardless of political affiliation.  #SaveACA
836642548701663232 2017-02-28 18:21:42 UTC <Archmom1> @SenateMajLdr last months have been hard. Russian interference in election, rise in antisemitic & racist incidents, & illegal travel ban.
836414505651433472 2017-02-27 03:15:32 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman you know what else should stop? Russian interference in the affairs of US.  Support an impartial investigation! #Russia
836412798112530436 2017-02-27 03:08:45 UTC <Archmom1> And Amercan tax payers are spending millions so Trump and family can cotinue lavish lifestyle in NYC & Florida. What a waste! #ResistTrumphttps://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/836390939472056321

836340832185827328 2017-02-27 22:22:47 UTC <Archmom1> @JOELARUE9 Insurance and pharmaceutical companies will continue to charge what they want. Regular people lose.
836339918788038656 2017-02-27 22:19:09 UTC <Archmom1> @JOELARUE9 Choices like plans that are cheaper, but that have higher deductibles, or that don't cover prescriptions. Pay more, get less.
836338752981241856 2017-02-27 22:14:31 UTC <Archmom1> @JOELARUE9 most common cause of bankrupcy= health crisis. We are all one scary diagnosis from fiancial ruin. ACA provides some protection.
836337581130461185 2017-02-27 22:09:52 UTC <Archmom1> @JOELARUE9 ACA helps me.I am protected by preexisting condition coverage & ban on lifetime spending caps though I am covered by employer.
836249824932605952 2017-02-27 16:21:09 UTC <Archmom1> @KCStar @senrobportman Thank you for speaking up. Please use your voice to speak out gainst hate. To the vulnerable silence = indifference.

835979552732114944 2017-02-26 22:27:11 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman your constituents are worried about Russia's involvement in the past election. We want a full impartial investigation.
835977981269016576 2017-02-26 22:20:57 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman but you refuse to attend a town hall. Actions speak louder than words. #TownHall

835871483146686465 2017-02-26 15:17:45 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan rescuing people by taking away their healthcare?  "Patient centered"= patients pay whatever insurance & pharma companies want.
835857863323054082 2017-02-26 14:23:38 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi u are talking to the insurance and pharma companies that funded your last campaign, right? 'Cause your plan does't help people.

835677235151581184 2017-02-25 02:25:53 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman by refusing a town hall,  u are silencing your constituents. Most of us aren't invited to the private events u favor. #OH12

835626873904300033 2017-02-25 23:05:46 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman how about an independent investigation on Trump's ties to Russia?
835625025856278528 2017-02-25 22:58:25 UTC <Archmom1> @SpeakerRyan access = if you can pay, you can have insurance, if you can't you will "choice" to do without. We will all pay more for less.
835621198251839489 2017-02-25 22:43:13 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman please step out of your echo chambers and tackle the hard work of democracy: meet with your constituents in a town hall.
835192502655254532 2017-02-24 18:19:44 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman will the Republican plan include mental health and addiction treatment like the ACA? Will lifetime spending caps be allowed?
835192014366998528 2017-02-24 18:17:47 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman how about those fighting other diseases?  If you repeal ACA millions of Americans could loose healthcare.

834749127409938433 2017-02-23 12:57:55 UTC <Archmom1> @VP you protect the freedom of corporations to charge whatever they want for healthcare and life saving meds, while u sacrifice our lives.
834748208366620672 2017-02-23 12:54:16 UTC <Archmom1> @VP for 30 million Americans who depend on ACA, the "freedom" to go without insurance because of cost is no freedom at all.
834600968155254784 2017-02-22 03:09:11 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi by meeting with only small groups of constituents, u are silencing the voices of the many that u need to hear #tiberitownhall

834522351387684864 2017-02-22 21:56:47 UTC <Archmom1> @WhirlpoolCorp @senrobportman Calling a closed event a "town hall" insults your constituents intelligence. When will host a real town hall?
834521587814653952 2017-02-22 21:53:45 UTC <Archmom1> @senrobportman your job is to represent all Ohioans, but you are not willing to listen and talk to us in a town hall. #ohiodistrict12
834402841292918786 2017-02-22 14:01:54 UTC <Archmom1> @PRyan ACA's ban on lifetime spending caps protects families from financial ruin. Repealing that protection helps only  insurance companies.
834401131744915456 2017-02-22 13:55:06 UTC <Archmom1> .@PRyan will millions have the "freedom" to "choose" not to have health insurance because it won't be affordable? You are the death panel.
834242475103571968 2017-02-21 03:24:40 UTC <Archmom1> @PatTiberi if you were actually listening, you would meet with constituents in a town hall. You refuse to listen. #tiberidoesntcare
