741982048089341954 2016-06-12 13:14:40 UTC <fi_turn> What will help is to stand up for the sexual assault victims and end rape culture. That's the only way "this shit" will end.
741981671692455936 2016-06-12 13:13:10 UTC <fi_turn> Sure, reposting the article of Facebook and saying "this shit needs to end" is nice and  to you.
741981512539611136 2016-06-12 13:12:32 UTC <fi_turn> But 20 minutes of action (non-consensual) is impacting the rest of hers.
741981311892520961 2016-06-12 13:11:44 UTC <fi_turn> That a rapist is given a drastically shortened sentence because "20 minutes of action" shouldn't impact the rest of his life.
741980824405299200 2016-06-12 13:09:48 UTC <fi_turn> That "men always want sex" and a male rape victim wasn't actually raped because he secretly wanted it.
741980538781601793 2016-06-12 13:08:40 UTC <fi_turn> That someone has to be asked what they were wearing as if that was what really made them get raped.
741980235629887488 2016-06-12 13:07:28 UTC <fi_turn> That the victim is to blame if they were drinking too much but the rapist is not if they were drinking too much.

727692972486057985 2016-05-03 02:54:59 UTC <fi_turn> I could use a hug and a hand to hold. Having a mild freak out session over nothing.

725878812823588865 2016-04-28 02:46:09 UTC <fi_turn> I wish I could explain your eyes, and how the sound of your voice gives me butterflies.

722756620137078788 2016-04-20 11:59:41 UTC <fi_turn> Trans people should still be referred to as their current preferred pronoun even when speaking of a time "before" their transition.
722756403262173184 2016-04-20 11:58:49 UTC <fi_turn> Someone could change their pronouns a thousand times a day and I would still respect that because they are discovering themselves.
