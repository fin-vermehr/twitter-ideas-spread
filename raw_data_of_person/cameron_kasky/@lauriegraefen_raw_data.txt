971462684989362176 2018-03-07 19:08:47 UTC <lauriegraefen> @CNN Hypocrite extraordinaire!
971439739235598336 2018-03-07 17:37:36 UTC <lauriegraefen> @netanyahu @jaketapper Does he really think not having a disagreement with trump is a good thing?  Therein lies the problem!
971438781164384256 2018-03-07 17:33:48 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump How about election theft?  We cannot allow that to happen as it just did!  SANCTIONS!

970651643602722816 2018-03-05 13:26:00 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump We call b.s.!  Why havent you done anything to prevent Russian meddling in upcoming elections?  Because by doing so, you are admitting that they did meddle!
970537111039434752 2018-03-04 05:50:53 UTC <lauriegraefen> @DLoesch You and Melania have something in common!  Stealing Michelle Obamas words!  Just like when you stole Emmas we call b.s.!  Just cant think or speak for yourself, can ya?

970011132554612737 2018-03-03 19:00:50 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Your comment on Skittles tweet is supposed to do what?  Mainstream media is trying to keep you in check despite your attempts at mocking the media. Touch!
969505344027267072 2018-03-02 09:31:01 UTC <lauriegraefen> @marcorubio We the People have elected an arrogant, boastful buffoon who literally made fun of (smeared) you during the debates.  Instead of taking a stand, you have sold your soul to the devil. You are part of the problem!
969317710785142784 2018-03-01 21:05:25 UTC <lauriegraefen> @waltshaub We are shocked?  This is the same man that went running to the White House to view classified documents right after trump was in office and no one got to the bottom of what that was all about.  B.S.  Vote him out!
969287060916985859 2018-03-01 19:03:38 UTC <lauriegraefen> @nytimes How about we cancel Ben Carson!  Deplorable!

968568031021535232 2018-02-27 19:26:28 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Ted Cruz?  Whose father you said was involved in JFKs death?  Or, whose wife you threatened to spill the beans on?  That Ted Cruz?  He wants your endorsement?  @tedcruz ??
968477729325768710 2018-02-27 13:27:38 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump You wrote this tweet because its so juvenile. The other tweets this morning where you use quotation marks correctly had to be written by someone else!

967796114039730177 2018-02-25 16:19:09 UTC <lauriegraefen> @kron4news The headline says students (plural) which gives the wrong impression. One student made the comment.
967722925808865280 2018-02-25 11:28:19 UTC <lauriegraefen> @IngrahamAngle You find what the teen said is inappropriate, but yet, you say inappropriate things all the time!  Its a whole new world and the GOP is about to find that out!

966759347157127168 2018-02-22 19:39:24 UTC <lauriegraefen> @RepTenney Wait!  I thought he was only 18 years old. He would have been 17 during last election, so he couldnt vote. How do you know hes a Democrat?  And, hes wearing a MAGA hat in photo.  What do you base your statement on?
966750266996461570 2018-02-22 19:03:19 UTC <lauriegraefen> @ananavarro Thats not the only disgusting thing that this deplorable said!  Sad!
966678164582944768 2018-02-22 14:16:49 UTC <lauriegraefen> @nbc @CNN @realDonaldTrump Do you ever read your own tweets?
966677781370359813 2018-02-22 14:15:17 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Only if Congress is in the mood to do something, anything!  Heres hoping!  Such a great leader!
966677261398282240 2018-02-22 14:13:13 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Better deterrent:  Ban assault rifles. Dont need to tally up minutes if they assault rifle is not available!
966676690809360384 2018-02-22 14:10:57 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump If everyone carries weapons, we can all shoot each other!  Problem not solved! Try again. This time, ask someone other than your country club cronies!

966357875852546049 2018-02-21 17:04:06 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump President Obama put in SANCTIONS and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for US election hacking!   QUESTION:  Why arent YOU enforcing SANCTIONS when you are admitting crimes were committed and meddling occurred?
966177082366742530 2018-02-20 05:05:41 UTC <lauriegraefen> @marcorubio Deflecting!  How much have you taken in donations. You the one who is acting like a concerned politician!  Write a bill requiring tests (mental, intelligence, training, etc.) in order to get a license to own a firearm.  DO SOMETHING!
966176431444316162 2018-02-20 05:03:06 UTC <lauriegraefen> @IronStache @SpeakerRyan   If not now, when?  Blood on your hands while you continue to be in the NRAs pockets!  SHAME!
966018106098372609 2018-02-20 18:33:58 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Oh, so you would only do it in a private space with no security. Thats oh so much better!
965942289989275648 2018-02-20 13:32:42 UTC <lauriegraefen> @esquire @realDonaldTrump   Winning at losing!

965775406124199936 2018-02-19 02:29:34 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump You are President. Look up dereliction of duty!  Grounds for impeachment!  And the title of a book!  Evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election in the U.S. is really incontrovertible.  H.R. McMaster, U.S. national-security adviser
965773807184203781 2018-02-19 02:23:13 UTC <lauriegraefen> @OrrinHatch @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump He doesnt need your support. And, most likely, doesnt want your support based on howyour other candidates have fared!
965688729162657792 2018-02-19 20:45:09 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Oprahs rubber and youre glue. Whatever you say, bounces off of her and sticks to you!  (There!  Language you can understand!)
965633743305224192 2018-02-19 17:06:39 UTC <lauriegraefen> @JohnCleese Ive never heard of Jasper Reed, but Ive heard of you and love your work. Jasper is irrelevant!
965632352272769027 2018-02-19 17:01:08 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump It would be great if SANCTIONs were put into place to save democracy!  But, it would take a President to do such a thing!  Little Donnie trump doesnt have what it takes to enforce SANCTIONS -or- hes being blackmailed by Putin and cant enforce SANCTIONS!
965458645575192576 2018-02-18 05:30:53 UTC <lauriegraefen> @SpeakerRyan Did the NRA write your speech for you before or after writing a  check to you?  Knee-jerk reaction?  Lets just go with jerk!
965457219818082304 2018-02-18 05:25:13 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Exposed?  Like YOU?
965281622215004162 2018-02-18 17:47:27 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Implement SANCTIONS!  You just admitted in this tweet that Russia is causing chaos, yet YOU refuse to put sanctions in place! MOSCOW is laughing at YOU, their PUPPET!
965255069578027009 2018-02-18 16:01:56 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump The FBI hasnt missed out on the many signals that YOU are sending!  The FBI will Make America Proud Again when they take YOU down!  Keep tweeting!

965235187331321856 2018-02-18 14:42:56 UTC <lauriegraefen> @ChuckGrassley Scores?  Thats important? How about tallying up the number of deaths from gun violence? Can you count that high?
965230660142223360 2018-02-18 14:24:57 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Whatever the topic, you can turn it around to how it impacts you!  You do realize that by diminishing the FBI, you have inspired the agents to work that much harder to uncover all aspects of collusion, right?  Best for you to remain silent, but you just cannot help yourself!
965228951919579141 2018-02-18 14:18:09 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump We returned their money which we were holding for US weapons that Iran purchased but that America never delivered. It was $400 million!  Either you know the truth and are intentionally stirring up your uneducated base or you dont care about the truth.
964976719609331713 2018-02-17 21:35:53 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Hmmmm!  And when did you get the rights to MAGA?  Me thinks you are lying, again!  Spin, spin, spin! And, you acknowledge the Russian group, but still no sanctions!  Who are you protecting?  Certainly not U.S.!
964877484482318336 2018-02-17 15:01:33 UTC <lauriegraefen> @TomFitton @FoxNews Trump should be putting sanctions in place and hasnt. Explain that!
964838516860571648 2018-02-17 12:26:42 UTC <lauriegraefen> @CNN Equivalent of Taking a knee!  HYPOCRITE!
964737799617425409 2018-02-16 05:46:30 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Can you spell collusion?  How about putting sanctions into place against Russia?  Also, not too bright of you to criticize the FBI. Theyre working hard. Coming for you!pic.twitter.com/2OrQrhozB1
964491495498711041 2018-02-16 13:27:46 UTC <lauriegraefen> @CBSNews @SpeakerRyan  How much has the NRA donated to your campaign?  You are doing their bidding at the cost of innocent lives. You have blood on your hands!

963498732229677056 2018-02-13 19:42:53 UTC <lauriegraefen> @jaketapper Sad that he cannot admit they were wrong
962763501675728896 2018-02-11 19:01:20 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Just keep repeating yourself so your uneducated base marches along with you!  The Constitution provides protection for the media from people like you!

960749623316017152 2018-02-05 05:38:54 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu I think trumps State of the Union was the first time he has ever seen a State of the Union speech. The opposing political party doesnt (and doesnt have to) clap for every statement made. This is a democracy, not a monarchy!
960559397008179201 2018-02-05 17:03:01 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump In your dreams!  Nunes was the same man that scurried over to the White House early last year to sound the alarm. What is he so afraid of?  What does he know that he was trying to alert you?  Theyre on your scent and hopefully getting closer to booting you out!
960558851421560832 2018-02-05 17:00:51 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump DACA was a promise made and should be a promise kept with no strings (or bricks, or barbed wire, or metal fences, or ...) attached.  Step up for once and back down on your idiotic wall!
960394439452749824 2018-02-04 06:07:32 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump You tried to harm the NFL with your rants and derogatory comments and then you have the stones to congratulate the winners. You dont get to play with us. Take your ball and go home!
960201045803716608 2018-02-04 17:19:03 UTC <lauriegraefen> @jaketapper @nycjim @DonaldJTrumpJr has a reading comprehension issue or he hasnt read the memo!

959278401201852416 2018-02-01 04:12:48 UTC <lauriegraefen> @DonaldJTrumpJr Fired?  I thought he resigned!  Telling tales again?  Arent you supposed to be running daddys business instead of getting involved in his business?

958056165769965568 2018-01-29 19:16:04 UTC <lauriegraefen> @DonaldJTrumpJr Little boy, you are not supposed to be involved in politics. Or, your fathers mouthpiece!
957828409538859008 2018-01-28 04:11:03 UTC <lauriegraefen> @DonaldJTrumpJr Really Skittles?  You find how he speaks offensive?  How about pops?  Whats your opinion about how your dad speaks of or treats women?
957798396143730689 2018-01-28 02:11:47 UTC <lauriegraefen> @hqtrivia Glitch. Didnt even get the answers up on the screen, but 900k did. Is this a scam?
957363898210021376 2018-01-27 21:25:14 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Says the man who revoked the promise made to Dreamers!  Hypocrite!

956945347120713728 2018-01-26 17:42:04 UTC <lauriegraefen> @CNN He would apologize?  He obviously used the post to further his agenda regardless of who originally posted the tweet!

956943133589278721 2018-01-26 17:33:16 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump DACA was a promise made and should be a promise kept. YOU are the one who revoked DACA, so pointing you little fingers elsewhere does not work!
956260409631281154 2018-01-24 20:20:22 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Do you really have to give everyone a nickname?  Is that because of all the names we call you?  Nana, nana, boo boo!
955813863903170560 2018-01-23 14:45:57 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump 50,000?  Please!  Me thinks you are being a bit dramatic if you think they had time to write 50,000 texts about YOU!

953345366983880705 2018-01-16 19:17:02 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Own your shit!  Or in your case, own the fact that you used the term shithole (or shithouse . . . no difference!)
953268563997069312 2018-01-16 14:11:51 UTC <lauriegraefen> @CNN Thats rich!  Be careful what you ask for!  Go talk to Putin!
953267857428746241 2018-01-16 14:09:02 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Imagine that the wall is built. Then what?  Are you going to put up fences along the coasts and a wall at the northern border?  You are delusional!
953141528628813825 2018-01-15 05:47:03 UTC <lauriegraefen> @SenTomCotton Seriously dude?  You have the audacity to speak about Martin Luther King, Jr!  Do you not see the irony?  How about YOU living up to some fundamental principles. . . start with being honest!  If you dont recall hearing shithole countries, that tells me that you are complicit!
953022396910448641 2018-01-15 21:53:40 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Dude, stop with the grade-school name calling!  Do you think that we believe that you did not say shithole countries when you have a derogatory nickname for just about everyone?  Grow up and apologize!
953021963731132418 2018-01-15 21:51:57 UTC <lauriegraefen> @POTUS @FLOTUS Do you understand words and actions?  Lets start with your platform of anti-bullying!  Lets start with your racist husband!  Lets start with DACA!  Please remain silent if you dont have the guts to back up your words with action!  Shame on you and your husband!
953021959503335424 2018-01-15 21:51:56 UTC <lauriegraefen> @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump   mr. trump, I feel compelled to share this with you!

952659468394860546 2018-01-14 21:51:31 UTC <lauriegraefen> @DineshDSouza YOU are disgusting!
952558639923040256 2018-01-14 15:10:52 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump It took you this long to explain the Id!  You dont and wont have a good relationship, so you are fooling no one but yourself!
952558025478410240 2018-01-14 15:08:25 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Deflecting from your Shithole Countries comment!  Just apologize already!

952354016872353793 2018-01-13 01:37:46 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump What was said that is fake?
952283720492437504 2018-01-13 20:58:26 UTC <lauriegraefen> @DesmondHoward @espn Keith Jackson was the best!
952171943368773632 2018-01-13 13:34:16 UTC <lauriegraefen> @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PARISDENNARD Complicit
952171599196770305 2018-01-13 13:32:54 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Is this a test to see who comments on the #ShitholePresident tweet?
952169821843742720 2018-01-13 13:25:50 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump You reversed DACA and then try to blame the Dems!  Does all talk refer to Durbin outing you with your racist comments? Just do us all a favor and RESIGN already!
952042950728482816 2018-01-12 05:01:42 UTC <lauriegraefen> @TomCottonAR COMPLICIT!   Take a stand and denounce trump! If not, then you silently agree with trumps racist remarks! #REMEMBERinNOVEMBER
951794131038277632 2018-01-12 12:32:58 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump The GOP controls the House and the Senate, so why do you continue to blame the Dems, you #ShitholePresident
951793817623191552 2018-01-12 12:31:44 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Always resort to MAGA when the heat is on you #ShitholePresident
951718759483559937 2018-01-11 07:33:28 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Oh bullshit!  You know you arent welcome and would be protested!  People from shitholes all over the world will protest you!
951634683510624263 2018-01-11 01:59:23 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Also from this Quinnipiac poll:   56% give Trump a D or F for his first year in office  66% say the Trump presidency has damaged America's reputation
950793639017541633 2018-01-09 18:17:23 UTC <lauriegraefen> @RealSheriffJoe Run Arpaio Run!  Ensure a Dem victory!
949353621174530049 2018-01-05 18:55:16 UTC <lauriegraefen> @washingtonpost And, Trumps loyal supporters have not figured this out, yet!  Still thinking his tax reform is going to make them rich!  SAD!
949351996024410113 2018-01-05 18:48:48 UTC <lauriegraefen> @DonaldJTrumpJr Wow!  Get called treasonous, and you swing back!  Bannon was the end-all be-all not that long ago. Such loyalty!
949348959411228672 2018-01-05 18:36:44 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump @ShafPatel @smitp007 @WakeUp1129 @OraisLinda @calitrumptrain World War Eleven!  Classic!  trump said that he loves the uneducated!
949348226548862978 2018-01-05 18:33:49 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump YOU are the most loyal person!  NOT!
948925307435839490 2018-01-04 14:33:18 UTC <lauriegraefen> @jaketapper @WalshFreedom Really, his voters couldnt put two and two together to figure out that is how he rolls?  The GOP stood by while he ignorantly took out each candidate one by one. You all elected him, you get to deal with his bullshit. And you call Dems snowflakes!
948924292712009729 2018-01-04 14:29:16 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Thats not why they take a knee ... and, you know it!
948665705926483968 2018-01-03 21:21:44 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump You do realize that that was there own money, right?  Or, facts just dont matter to you?  Any attempt to tarnish President Obama is all that matters to you!
948341290684608513 2018-01-02 23:52:37 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Make way for Mitt Romney!  Remember when you invited Romney to dinner under the pretense of offering a cabinet position (but, really to put him in his place)?  Well, that little stunt will come back to bite you! #Romney2018
948340327722741760 2018-01-02 23:48:48 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Do you ever think before you speak?  Do you even know what you are talking about?
948192765116067842 2018-01-02 14:02:26 UTC <lauriegraefen> @CNN For the amount of money its cost the country, he better be good at golf!
946779017885167616 2017-12-29 16:24:42 UTC <lauriegraefen> @JoeNBC @tribelaw This tweet will be forwarded to every Rep and Senator this weekend!  Profound!
946751015881203712 2017-12-29 14:33:26 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump You could never compare to President Obama, so stop trying!  @foxandfriends cant compare to a real news organization, and doesnt even try!
946748378221891586 2017-12-29 14:22:57 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Funny!  @foxandfriends is not a news show. Its infotainment!  You do get that, right?
946592528920403970 2017-12-28 04:03:40 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Are you really that much of a moron?  Climate change isnt confined to global warming. It involves extreme climate change. Now I know why you like the uneducated!  YOU are uneducated!
946508741041709056 2017-12-28 22:30:43 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Oh, I love Vanity Fair. In particular, I love Graydon Carters opinion of you and his nickname for you!   Short-FingeredVulgarian!
945644258631061504 2017-12-26 13:15:35 UTC <lauriegraefen> @ananavarro trump is just playing to his evangelical Christian base. He knows if he keeps saying it over and over again, his base will believe him. Thats why he said that he loves the uneducated. He can manipulate them!
945169873931591680 2017-12-24 05:50:33 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Seriously, no one was afraid to say Merry Christmas!  And, you led nothing!  People were being respectful to non-Christians by saying Happy Holidays!  Respectful!  Look it up!  Since I dont find you to be very Christian, I respectfully wish you Happy Holidays!
944324237497716736 2017-12-22 21:50:17 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump This kiss of !  An endorsement from trump!
944201412455620608 2017-12-22 13:42:13 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Really!  May be some companies are, but way to piss off Americans that dont get bonuses. So out of touch!
944020791489908736 2017-12-21 01:44:30 UTC <lauriegraefen> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Fox and Friends is not in the news business. This is infotainment at its worst.  Network television personalities!  Certainly, not journalists!
943649346234605570 2017-12-20 01:08:30 UTC <lauriegraefen> @stevesilberman Pence does not speak for me!
942932375302017024 2017-12-18 01:39:31 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Traveling around is not an accomplishment!   Stop damaging relationships here and abroad. Im surprised you havent given us the tally in days and rounds of golf!  Doofus!
942831169346908160 2017-12-18 18:57:22 UTC <lauriegraefen> @OhNoSheTwitnt @DonaldJTrumpJr   Seriously dude, show some class!  I know thats beyond you, but at least try!
942829935428882432 2017-12-18 18:52:28 UTC <lauriegraefen> @SarahPalinUSA @FoxNews Hmmm. Who is Sarah going to blame this time?
942099461882437632 2017-12-16 18:29:49 UTC <lauriegraefen> @JohnCornyn Are you referring to the texts that trumps DOJ illegally (and, purposely) gave to the media?
942098540016422913 2017-12-16 18:26:09 UTC <lauriegraefen> @JohnCornyn Mueller already removed the agents that commented about trump from the investigation long ago, but thanks for chiming in!  Try cleaning house by draining the swamp and impeaching trump!
942061334702755840 2017-12-16 15:58:19 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Nice commercial!  NOT!  You do realize that you are the president, right?
942011216792301568 2017-12-16 12:39:10 UTC <lauriegraefen> @tedlieu Direct consequence of trump and his fake media stance!
940945961538420738 2017-12-13 14:06:13 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Roy Moore was the best the GOP had to offer?  There was no other candidate?  The deck was stacked against him because of his history, lack of integrity and your endorsement!
940812811227234304 2017-12-12 05:17:08 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Loser, loser, loser! The trump effect results in a Dem win in a deep red state!
940781181947260928 2017-12-12 03:11:27 UTC <lauriegraefen> @jaketapper @CNN Holy moly!  People should have to be tested before being able to vote!  Close your mouth when you are dumbfounded. Not a good look!
940777075560067073 2017-12-12 02:55:08 UTC <lauriegraefen> @EdKrassen From your lips to Gods ears!
940776915534798848 2017-12-12 02:54:30 UTC <lauriegraefen> @krassenstein This country put a narcissistic bigot in the highest office, so I wont be surprised this time!  I have high hopes for Alabama!
940772786192224258 2017-12-12 02:38:05 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Hey trump, President Obama has way more likes than you do for his Happy Hanukkah tweet!
940226547683942400 2017-12-11 14:27:32 UTC <lauriegraefen> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Turn on the television. A explosion in NYC. May be a little more important than your tantrum tweet!
940081453483769857 2017-12-10 04:50:59 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC Taxpayer money spent on golf!  Unless it was your turn to babysit, you are COMPLICIT!
939975239240384514 2017-12-10 21:48:55 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Takes one to know one!  You sit on a throne of lies!  Im rubber, youre glue!  (Trying to speak to you on your level!)  So, everyone, Media, FBI, Immigrants, former Presidents, on and on, are all liars. And, you are a proven liar!    RESIGN!  Thats all I want for Christmas!
939253685665828864 2017-12-08 22:01:43 UTC <lauriegraefen> @SteveKingIA Seriously!  America is a melting pot of cultures!  Who are you?  Who do you represent?  Just white Americans?  Please explain this tweet!
939195802534268928 2017-12-08 18:11:43 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump MAGA = Trump resigns!
938833401909579776 2017-12-07 18:11:40 UTC <lauriegraefen> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump With everything going on, you find the time to do a twitter commercial promoting a book!
938601020338376704 2017-12-06 02:48:16 UTC <lauriegraefen> @DonaldJTrumpJr Are you calling for your fathers removal?  Where is the outrage about Roy Moore?
938580616672632833 2017-12-06 01:27:11 UTC <lauriegraefen> @SenFranken There are misdemeanors and there are felonies. This has been a painful misdemeanor that you handled respectfully, appropriately and timely. While we want the best for our country, we also want the best for you!  We need you now more than ever. Continue to set an example. Stay!
938578615733751808 2017-12-06 01:19:14 UTC <lauriegraefen> @POTUS @VP And, have you thought of the consequences?  Why do you think no former President did so?
938561590235947009 2017-12-06 00:11:35 UTC <lauriegraefen> @cnnbrk Someone had an awful lot of time to come up with an explanation. Would love to hear if Hope Hicks corroborates his explanation after she wipes the bus tracks off her back!
938560194455449600 2017-12-06 00:06:02 UTC <lauriegraefen> @cnnbrk Wow!  Does he really think we, the people, believe him?
938559007467429888 2017-12-06 00:01:19 UTC <lauriegraefen> @Stowydad @MPRnews @SenFranken Please, please DO NOT RESIGN. You have led by example and we NEED you to continue to lead by example!  The country needs you
938557421806637056 2017-12-06 23:55:01 UTC <lauriegraefen> @SenFranken Please DO NOT RESIGN!  We, the people, NEED you now more than ever!
938481396393369602 2017-12-06 18:52:55 UTC <lauriegraefen> @SenatorDurbin Are you calling from Trumps removal?  Where is the outrage about Roy Moore?
938481168613363712 2017-12-06 18:52:01 UTC <lauriegraefen> @SenatorCantwell Are you calling from Trumps removal?  Where is the outrage about Roy Moore?
938466566374678528 2017-12-06 17:53:59 UTC <lauriegraefen> @SenFranken We NEED you!  You did the honorable thing, took responsibility and apologized.
938414288888352768 2017-12-06 14:26:16 UTC <lauriegraefen> @jaketapper The predators get a dishonorable mention!
938402587577024512 2017-12-06 13:39:46 UTC <lauriegraefen> Alabama values?  Is that defined as the ability to ignore lack of integrity; to overlook lack of character; to condone pedophilia?  YOU are the best that Alabama has to offer?  Sad state of affairs if Alabama thinks you represent their values!    #VoteDougJones
937672641074335744 2017-12-04 13:19:13 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump Who wrote this?
937458072125165568 2017-12-03 23:06:36 UTC <lauriegraefen> @CNNPolitics Love this analogy!
937066279814430721 2017-12-02 21:09:45 UTC <lauriegraefen> @realDonaldTrump . . . because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.  Flynn just plead guilty to lying to the FBI!  Cant wait to hear what he lied about!  Care to share?
936874514008248320 2017-12-02 08:27:45 UTC <lauriegraefen> @senorrinhatch @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Prepare to lose control of the House during the mid-terms!
936768973366005765 2017-12-01 01:28:22 UTC <lauriegraefen> @SenFranken So very glad you are continuing to work for the American people!  You have acknowledged your responsibility and apologized. Your apology was accepted. Continue to lead by example.  Godspeed!
936538844270419968 2017-12-01 10:13:55 UTC <lauriegraefen> @DonaldJTrumpJr Its all coming together!  Doesnt take a psychologist to figure you out.  VERY SAD!
