890907346217521152 2017-07-28 12:10:38 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill Why allow state legislatures to pick senators rather than voters? Because they've gerrymandered the state houses to shit
890819874255024128 2017-07-27 06:23:03 UTC <NebiTessema> @SenatorFischer It's the height of dishonesty to suggest that the 8 pages you guys cobbled together over lunch is a form of relief

883062489201684480 2017-07-06 20:37:58 UTC <NebiTessema> @ezlusztig Missed opportunity to use the term "Sandernistas"
883013501949706241 2017-07-06 17:23:19 UTC <NebiTessema> @tedcruz He represents the beginning of what has been a *very* underwhelming 21st century for Republican presidents
882996574695116801 2017-07-06 16:16:03 UTC <NebiTessema> @washingtonpost It is literally their highest priority. The nationalism and dog whistles are just to get the rubes on board
882699012826181633 2017-07-05 20:33:39 UTC <NebiTessema> @bessbell A little too "urban" for his tastes, no?
882697067507961858 2017-07-05 20:25:55 UTC <NebiTessema> @politico @JohnCornyn Are you going to ask him how he interprets the phrase "I hope you can see your way to letting this go, to letting Flynn go?"
882688822575804416 2017-07-05 19:53:09 UTC <NebiTessema> @politico Isn't that the whole point of Trump?
882685135430328320 2017-07-05 19:38:30 UTC <NebiTessema> @DLoesch You all refuse to even acknowledge the wrongful death of a lawful gun owner but will go outside your wheelhouse to defend a racist memester?
882667655559344128 2017-07-05 18:29:02 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill @GOP is Soros behind this?
882663129846558722 2017-07-05 18:11:03 UTC <NebiTessema> @ColeStangler Most important qualification to make geopolitical and military decisions for the GOP is to look cool in a leather jacket
882632320804675584 2017-07-05 16:08:38 UTC <NebiTessema> @JohnCornyn Isn't your party's position that NPR and mainstream media are fake news?
882627461284061184 2017-07-05 15:49:19 UTC <NebiTessema> @tedcruz Ted, you're a supporter of a strong man authoritarian (who personally insulted your wife) and attacking the press the day after July 4th.
882305473470484483 2017-07-04 18:29:51 UTC <NebiTessema> @andizeisler @SICKOFWOLVES Hey, I think this guy should guard the sheep!
882256292773076992 2017-07-04 15:14:26 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill I don't think more celebrity politicians is the answer
882091042480291841 2017-07-03 04:17:47 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill Strong American leadership looks and behaves a lot like a high school freshman
882050222792290306 2017-07-03 01:35:35 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill @reeldolantramph There will be no explanation or follow up
882039622372556800 2017-07-03 00:53:28 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill Fox is the state propaganda machine. They occupy the same place as Spicer and Huckabee-Sanders
882028887882031106 2017-07-03 00:10:48 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill Imagine getting a PhD in quantum chem,becoming first woman Chancellor of Germany and having to explain greenhouse gases to a trust fund baby
882018375546937345 2017-07-03 23:29:02 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill It's sad to witness an erosion in the conduct of public servants. Trump's behavior has already lowered the bar
881948478737440768 2017-07-03 18:51:17 UTC <NebiTessema> @Chris_arnade What are the chances that this woman is a Medicaid recipient?
881856361293807616 2017-07-03 12:45:15 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill @ElaineD9999999 Then when she's called on to testify she'll be asked why she stayed on in the face of misconduct like Comey was less than a month ago
881567744713535488 2017-07-02 17:38:23 UTC <NebiTessema> @JohnCornyn Is it funny that the president is acting especially unhinged today?

881551034556067840 2017-07-02 16:31:59 UTC <NebiTessema> @SeanMcElwee I don't think it's odd. those are western leaders, Trudeau's is a border country where they speak english. Moon is relatively inaccessible
881518019406639105 2017-07-02 14:20:48 UTC <NebiTessema> @realDonaldTrump @MikeTokes @eugenegu @eshton58 Kathy Griffin doesn't get the nuclear codes or access to any intelligence the US has ever gathered
881504684736950277 2017-07-02 13:27:49 UTC <NebiTessema> Just the president joking (but not really) about violence against the press againhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/881503147168071680
881216503860875264 2017-07-01 18:22:41 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill They could cut down on the bureaucracy by sending it to Russia themselves

881161508629118976 2017-07-01 14:44:09 UTC <NebiTessema> @awhawth Kids, sometimes we have to do things we aren't proud of in order to to gain politcal power and promote our hotels, clothing and jewelry
881160315957805057 2017-07-01 14:39:25 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill Ok, but is there any sort of historical precedent he can point to? Sounds like liberal hysteria to me and mine at the good ol' @NRA
880987793811439616 2017-06-30 03:13:52 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill I get the feeling that this administration might not be dedicated to the truth or to facts
880561971078103045 2017-06-29 23:01:48 UTC <NebiTessema> @RawStory This is chapter 11 in The Art of The Deal
880560845746393088 2017-06-29 22:57:20 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill It's almost as if this Trump guy isn't reasonable

880166817276325890 2017-06-28 20:51:36 UTC <NebiTessema> @thehill Surprises are great for insurance markets
880053040610463744 2017-06-28 13:19:30 UTC <NebiTessema> @realDonaldTrump I don't think internet taxes are what you think they are.
880041353383694336 2017-06-28 12:33:03 UTC <NebiTessema> @realDonaldTrump @jules_su I support Obamacare, but I thought premiums would "fall" once companies can go back to putting lifetime/annual caps on crappy policies?
880036674822123520 2017-06-28 12:14:28 UTC <NebiTessema> @JohnCornyn Youre trying to obfuscate because healthcare law is complex, but youre literally going to kill elderly, disabled and kids with medicaid cuts
879897433051983872 2017-06-27 03:01:10 UTC <NebiTessema> @AP Only way to improve @realDonaldTrump terrible, failing approval numbers. If they don't act fast he will be canceled!

879827893332869121 2017-06-27 22:24:50 UTC <NebiTessema> @realDonaldTrump GOP workin hard every day to ruin the lives of working poor people, children, the disabled, the elderly

879191356589178880 2017-06-25 04:15:28 UTC <NebiTessema> @CNBC Kellyanne knows most able-bodied people on Medicaid work low-paying jobs that don't offer insurance but they don't care about working poor
879157175402319873 2017-06-25 01:59:39 UTC <NebiTessema> @dcexaminer @tedcruz @ChuckNellisJail @SOSUSA2016 Just because a person can't afford their medical bills doesn't make them lazy. There are millions of poor folks who work very hard every day
878711759430963200 2017-06-24 20:29:43 UTC <NebiTessema> @realDonaldTrump Who is T?
878624537096716289 2017-06-24 14:43:08 UTC <NebiTessema> @jstines3 The government is a potential vehicle to care for each other. If the point is to love one another, why not use your vote to that end?
878623774140223492 2017-06-24 14:40:06 UTC <NebiTessema> @dcexaminer @tedcruz @ChuckNellisJail I think it speaks for itselfpic.twitter.com/DpHkgabhLR
878623086647668738 2017-06-24 14:37:22 UTC <NebiTessema> @dcexaminer @tedcruz @ChuckNellisJail Since he doesnt seem to be doing that anymore, maybe it would be good to carry on in the spirit of his work and show compassion for the sick
878620004668854272 2017-06-24 14:25:07 UTC <NebiTessema> @dcexaminer @tedcruz @ChuckNellisJail How is this something youre proud of? Surely the richest country on earth can do better than insurance that doesn't cover hospitalizationspic.twitter.com/HaYVBEg4ig
878612418116673538 2017-06-24 13:54:58 UTC <NebiTessema> @tedcruz Isn't it nice when people you care about have access to good healthcare when they need it? Don't take that away from 20 milion Americans.
878611015398764544 2017-06-24 13:49:24 UTC <NebiTessema> @tedcruz @JohnCornyn This boy deserves every opportunity to live his life. History and God won't look favorably on your actions.https://twitter.com/aliranger29/status/878434441584160769

878070438168993795 2017-06-22 02:01:20 UTC <NebiTessema> @reeedss @RodriguezThaGod @LP62O @beyjustins @syeoga @eckhardtemily They don't claim to be a no-kill shelter. If they don't take the animals in they don't magically get a loving home - they die a gnarly death
878029566551379968 2017-06-22 23:18:56 UTC <NebiTessema> @grownboyee If you people had any good points or really believed your position you wouldn't have to resort to small minded personal attacks.
878027711272304640 2017-06-22 23:11:33 UTC <NebiTessema> Hillary shills have thin skin and engage in age shaming. Sad! https://twitter.com/etreetro/status/878026938127966208
878026493997096960 2017-06-22 23:06:43 UTC <NebiTessema> Hillary shills still finding ways to condescend Berniebros. Plz Just admit your centrist baloney doesn't play and that you miscalculated. https://twitter.com/etreetro/status/877481600338079744
878023695511560194 2017-06-22 22:55:36 UTC <NebiTessema> @realDonaldTrump I thoughtbit was mean. You're crackin up, Donny. Go home, Donny. Give it up.
