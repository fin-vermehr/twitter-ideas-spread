748960794776260612 2016-07-01 19:25:43 UTC <freyjawired> B) Subconscious, also considered the God Center, in theory translates for soul to biology lvl thinking and vise versa.
748960026702671872 2016-07-01 19:22:40 UTC <freyjawired> A) You mentioned spirit/soul source of Love. Consider that Through SC soul self connects to biological part of temporal self
748958310800306176 2016-07-01 19:15:50 UTC <freyjawired> biology is physical, just breaks down to smaller parts Body, systems to anatomical & energy, resonance, etc

748955709086150656 2016-07-01 19:05:30 UTC <freyjawired> 2) they are distinct functions yet inseparable. One can Love physical existence from the soul and in such love their whole
748955342982094848 2016-07-01 19:04:03 UTC <freyjawired> 1) there is always an element of both the animal and the higher brain functions we assume are not animal, soulless.
748954832124338176 2016-07-01 19:02:01 UTC <freyjawired> @iGreenMonk just needed clarification where you were going with your thoughts of "insanity" of Love.
748954474639613952 2016-07-01 19:00:36 UTC <freyjawired> the SC does work behind the scenes or subversively to awake conscious unless better integrated for theta wave Day thinking.
