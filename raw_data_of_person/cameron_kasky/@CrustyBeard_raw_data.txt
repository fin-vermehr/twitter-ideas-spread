969059087181860864 2018-02-28 03:57:45 UTC <CrustyBeard> @KatiePavlich @FoxNews So, we're supposed to believe that Navy SEALS could sneak into Pakistan in the middle of the night where their military academy is, and take out Bin Laden, but they couldn't breach a basic wall?  Yeah, I'm calling bull shit.

968939711380193280 2018-02-28 20:03:23 UTC <CrustyBeard> It was a smart move by us Liberals to plant this teacher at Dalton High School 14 years ago for this very moment.  #HailHydra
968939221670088708 2018-02-28 20:01:27 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Borriemoto Your lack of ability to admit when Liberals are right is proof we can't have an intelligent discussion.
968937818826444800 2018-02-28 19:55:52 UTC <CrustyBeard> The teacher who fired the gun at Dalton High School was a law-abiding, responsible gun owner...right up until he fired the weapon in the classroom.  But, keep lecturing us how responsible gun owners don't do this stuff.

968894565930426370 2018-02-28 17:04:00 UTC <CrustyBeard> @FoxNews @foxandfriends @CaseyCagle You chose the NRA over one of GA's biggest employers and economic drivers. You didn't much foresight into that. Think harder in the future.

968188215080423424 2018-02-26 18:17:13 UTC <CrustyBeard> Does anyone actually want to live and send your kids to school in a country where it's necessary for 20% of all teachers to be armed? By that thought alone, isn't stricter gun control better? #MondayMotivation
968182253506482176 2018-02-26 17:53:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DLoesch @sarahdrew A) The 5 million is an inflated number B) Even if true, it's roughly 2% of the American population.

967895600086831104 2018-02-25 22:54:28 UTC <CrustyBeard> @zen310 @spookperson @DLoesch The truth is that the NRA-ILA exists as a subsidiary so that the NRA itself won't lose its 501(c)(4) status with the IRS.  But, we all know that for practical purposes, the NRA is a government lobbyist agency for gun manufacturers.
967892719271018497 2018-02-25 22:43:01 UTC <CrustyBeard> @zen310 @spookperson @DLoesch Dana is only trying to argue legal semantics. We all can see through it.

967804123046449152 2018-02-25 16:50:58 UTC <CrustyBeard> @bethanyshondark It's just much easier than "semi-automatic weapons with high capacity magazines that fire multiple rounds per second at a speed of 3200 ft/second ." Or we can use the technical term from the 1994 ban, which is "assault-style weapon."  There, are you happy?

966813029991108608 2018-02-22 23:12:43 UTC <CrustyBeard> @AP I have a very good friend who is a school resource officer.  He is thoroughly disgusted by this report.

966784299096788992 2018-02-22 21:18:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> Can we not make the speakers at a certain conference trend unless they do something memorable, like accidentally choke on a pretzel?
966783475197018112 2018-02-22 21:15:17 UTC <CrustyBeard> @SwallowThatShit @dave__esq @dirtypimp56 He also thinks that Deep State has a great football program.
966783038381228034 2018-02-22 21:13:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> @dave__esq I bought a candy bar in Texas once.  Is that the same thing?

966750898176307200 2018-02-22 19:05:50 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DLoesch @NRA Bad news, NRA.  You're not going to be the ones painting the narrative this year.  That ended last week.  Get used to it.  Change is coming.  You can lead, follow or get the hell out of the way.  But, you're not stopping it.
966750401298075650 2018-02-22 19:03:51 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DLoesch @NRA Go Away.
966748762826792960 2018-02-22 18:57:21 UTC <CrustyBeard> @CNN Dear @NRA.  We're going to make your donations appear like an albatross on your candidates' necks in November.  This time, we're painting the pictures and we're driving the narratives.
966748478671085569 2018-02-22 18:56:13 UTC <CrustyBeard> That's interesting.  @DLoesch didn't have the nerve to say that to any of the mothers in Florida last night.  I guess she can get away with that when he has a more receptive audience.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/966707132832903168
966745838029504512 2018-02-22 18:45:43 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JoshuaGuess @twocareers I love it.  I would have said the same thing.
966740663030173698 2018-02-22 18:25:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JoshuaGuess He blocked me years ago after I called him the dumbest person on Fox News.  I'm glad to see he's proving me right.  Please tell me that most of them are saying how they would congratulate their kids.
966717890333433857 2018-02-22 16:54:40 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA Dear @nra.  On behalf of the 325 million Americans that ARE NOT part of your organization, we want significant changes to the gun laws and policies in America.  So you have 3 choices: Lead, follow, or get the hell out of the way. Choose wisely.
966707274231279616 2018-02-22 16:12:29 UTC <CrustyBeard> @brianschatz Senator, can you remind America that your home state, with its Democratic leadership and strong gun laws, leads the nation in fewest gun-related homicides?
966706765843910656 2018-02-22 16:10:28 UTC <CrustyBeard> @brianschatz @AdavisWilliams @Pseudosaurus @ScottTerna School budgets keep getting gutted to the point that teachers have to buy their own supplies (which they can no longer write off thanks to the new tax law.)  Who's paying for multiple armed guards? Serious answers only, Scott.
966706066053623808 2018-02-22 16:07:41 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @DeanObeidallah That's what I kept saying last night every time Dana said that number.  Their members make up less than 2% of the population. It's time the majority takes back over.
966705693846921217 2018-02-22 16:06:12 UTC <CrustyBeard> Dear @GOP.  This is how a REAL leader speaks--without a sheet of paper reminding him to listen to Americans who are hurting.https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/966704319658647553

966685148648439808 2018-02-22 14:44:34 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump @sharkchar If it's not the gun, how did a guy in Las Vegas kill 59 people and wound 100s more from a 32nd floor hotel window that was 100s of feet away?  And what sidearm would have stopped him from street level?  Get a clue.  It's the gun.
966684810658840576 2018-02-22 14:43:13 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump Yes, because what we need at schools while people are running for their lives is more cross-fire.  Jesus Christ, how stupid.
966683471413501952 2018-02-22 14:37:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @AP_Politics #6 Give them Roy Moore's phone number.
966679733751746560 2018-02-22 14:23:03 UTC <CrustyBeard> So apparently Chris Loesch and Dana Loesch think the students in Parkland are somehow well-funded and organized.  Huh.  Hey, what's the annual budget of the @NRA again?
966649489753853953 2018-02-22 12:22:52 UTC <CrustyBeard> Huh. Yesterday, you said you want to arm teachers. I guess Hillary wasn't wrong.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/734231223002894337
966513674402828288 2018-02-21 03:23:11 UTC <CrustyBeard> Yes, Dana.  Attack CNN in front of these students. That will work. #studentsstandup
966513134373670912 2018-02-21 03:21:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> Dana's trying to butter them up first.  I don't think they are going to buy it. #StudentsStandUp
966512730961338373 2018-02-21 03:19:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> Emma vs Dana. This should be entertaining. #StudentsStandUp
966506941517266945 2018-02-21 02:56:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> If this was a cage match between Cameron Kasky and Marco Rubio, Marco would have tapped out in round one.
966505864319336449 2018-02-21 02:52:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> Rubio won't say he won't accept NRA donations. #studentsstandup
966505476824403969 2018-02-21 02:50:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> Wow, he just plain asked Rubio if he'll accept future NRA donations. #studentsstandup
966500346418941953 2018-02-21 02:30:13 UTC <CrustyBeard> If Rubio, a career politician, is getting beaten up this bad and the crowd is so fired up, Dana Loesch may not want to come out at all.
966498791649095681 2018-02-21 02:24:03 UTC <CrustyBeard> No armed guard would have done a thing for the people in Las Vegas. #StudentsStandUp
966498278983467013 2018-02-21 02:22:01 UTC <CrustyBeard> Attention Senator Rubio, here's your ass. #studentsstandup
966496593854844928 2018-02-21 02:15:19 UTC <CrustyBeard> Remember when you watch these #StudentsStandUp. At least 75% of them will be voting age by 2020.
966485169250209797 2018-02-21 01:29:55 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WTAE @SalCerasini There was. Do you not realize that these kids were there?  They witnessed it.  They knew people who were killed. Give them some credit for finally standing up.
966481593924833281 2018-02-21 01:15:43 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WTAE @SalCerasini Pay attention. They've said all that and more.  All I'm telling you is this: Dismiss and discount them all you want. It would be a mistake.
966479430221627392 2018-02-21 01:07:07 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WTAE @SalCerasini They're not being used. They're the next era of voters, and their motivated. If you think young people can't change America, I suggest you attend a same-sex marriage.
966477195077148672 2018-02-21 00:58:14 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WTAE @SalCerasini Kids finally got tired of it. Deal with it.
966429655552143360 2018-02-21 21:49:19 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mccauchiner So,  the NRA has Dana Loesch on air talking with images showing a practical armageddon and call that "news."  Come on.  That's way over the top.  It's counter-productive because turns average people off from them.
966428735766441985 2018-02-21 21:45:40 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mccauchiner Don't go down the tu quoque/red herring road.  That's when you lose people.
966428181833113600 2018-02-21 21:43:28 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mccauchiner I never said that.  The NRA forgot it's original mission.  It was created to be a gun safety and instruction organization in 1871.  It wasn't until 100 years later than it became a lobbyist group. Now, it streams "news" that has nothing to do with the 2A.
966427539349622784 2018-02-21 21:40:55 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mccauchiner Yes, but certain guns are capable of doing much more harm.  What's going to cause more carnage: an AR-15 with a high capacity magazine loaded with .223s or a revolver?
966427072435539969 2018-02-21 21:39:04 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mccauchiner If criminals don't follow laws, why have any at all?  Why outlaw stealing, kidnapping, fraud or any other crime? We do it because we can't have anarchy.  And with the NRA as a lobbying agent and not a teaching one, we're heading toward anarchy.
966426516547670017 2018-02-21 21:36:51 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mccauchiner Yes I do.  My brother-in-law is an NRA instructor.  I've taken his class.  Don't presume to know what I do.
966425053540880385 2018-02-21 21:31:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mccauchiner You also have to take driving courses and pass a test to get a license.  Let's apply mandatory classes and license testing to firearm registration.
966420211984424962 2018-02-21 21:11:48 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mccauchiner Yeah, cars. You must have insurance to drive them, register them and have a license to drive. You pay taxes on them and get them inspected annually.  Let's apply the same requirements to firearms. It won't restrict your freedoms one bit any more than it restricts your driving.
966416119685894144 2018-02-21 20:55:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mccauchiner Yes, so why do you insist on making it so much easier for people to be able to do it?
966415131553886208 2018-02-21 20:51:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mccauchiner No, they just hate being shot.
966414972535427077 2018-02-21 20:50:59 UTC <CrustyBeard> @CrookdHillary I've screenshotted this.  I'm sending it to his family.  They'll find out your real name and sue you.
966413909891657728 2018-02-21 20:46:45 UTC <CrustyBeard> So, the RWNJs, who claims these kids are paid shrills, will literally be represented at the Town Hall by an actual paid shrill employed directly by the NRA-- @DLoeschhttps://twitter.com/teamtrace/status/966364473966694401
966404899683618816 2018-02-21 20:10:57 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BayshoreRunner It's awful convenient that you talk about pawns when your avatar is a photo of Kate Steinle.  Projection much, asshole?
966402323730911232 2018-02-21 20:00:43 UTC <CrustyBeard> @lucianwintrich I'd love to see you say this to those kids' faces.  You'd piss in your pants if you ever had to face them in public.
966400895469539328 2018-02-21 19:55:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Dramaminefield @thistallawkgirl Let's also remember that he claimed today he was attacking the media and not the kids.  Even though he said "kids" in his Tweet.
966398732869799942 2018-02-21 19:46:27 UTC <CrustyBeard> @conncarroll Even if Congress was in session, would @SenMikeLee meet with and listen to them?  Asking for a lot of friends.https://twitter.com/uwork4utah/status/966391851564523520
966396088872824833 2018-02-21 19:35:57 UTC <CrustyBeard> Hey, @FLGovScott , did no one tell you those kids were coming to Tallahassee today?  You'd think a decent man would have cleared up 30 minutes on his schedule to meet with them.
966395238595088384 2018-02-21 19:32:34 UTC <CrustyBeard> @FLGovScott Make time.https://twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/966394323498659840
966394960978284545 2018-02-21 19:31:28 UTC <CrustyBeard> I just did a quick check on IMDb.  I didn't find a single one of those #ParklandStudents there.  I guess they must not be actors.
966394548246204417 2018-02-21 19:29:49 UTC <CrustyBeard> @sarahdrew @barretta44 @drum_ear My wife teaches martial arts in day cares all around where we live.  I've gone with her at times to help.  Believe me, I see those teachers struggling with hyper kids. The thought of a kid accidentally getting a hold of a gun from them is terrifying.
966385469364850688 2018-02-21 18:53:45 UTC <CrustyBeard> @sarahdrew @drum_ear @barretta44 Have you been to a pre-school lately?  They struggle just to keep all the kids in one room together, and you expect the teachers to be packing heat?  Are you nuts?
966385074689241095 2018-02-21 18:52:11 UTC <CrustyBeard> Psst.  Russian bots don't have First Amendment Protection on a private website. #twitterlockout
966383354651299841 2018-02-21 18:45:20 UTC <CrustyBeard> @TomPerez Pretty soon they'll be voting for the next 60 years and more.  That's what everyone needs to realize.
966381550395904002 2018-02-21 18:38:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> Watching these #ParklandStudentsSpeak reminds me of this: If you think young people can't make a difference, I suggest you visit an integrated public school or attend a same-sex wedding.  At one point, no one thought those were possible.
966379155083464705 2018-02-21 18:28:39 UTC <CrustyBeard> What the GOP and NRA are ignorant of is the fact that these are people who will be voting for the next 60 years and more.https://twitter.com/PeterSchorschFL/status/966350903132540929
966351854023184389 2018-02-21 16:40:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DineshDSouza What you're really sorry about is that you got called out by your own base for being such a complete asshole.
966349748386050048 2018-02-21 16:31:48 UTC <CrustyBeard> @marcthiessen Any time you intentionally omit commonly known details, you insult everyone's intelligence.  And then, you're the one who looks truly stupid.
966342908285800450 2018-02-21 16:04:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> @marcthiessen In your column in WaPo today, why did you fail to mention the bi-partisan Russian sanctions bill that passed overwhelmingly in Congress & was signed very reluctantly by POTUS?  Why did you fail to mention that he hasn't implemented it? You're extremely disingenuous.
966330052723052544 2018-02-21 15:13:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> To all the RWNJs who lost all their fake Russian followers during the #TwitterLockOut, we real Americans with real followers want to offer our sincerest #BotsandPrayers.
966323058993778689 2018-02-21 14:45:45 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Emma4Change @remysmidt I love these young women and men. America knows they are real, and their motives are genuine.

966319973697277952 2018-02-21 14:33:29 UTC <CrustyBeard> @AP @Dapandico1 Why do you care?  Do you want ICE to deport him as soon as he's released from the hospital?
966319223554367489 2018-02-21 14:30:30 UTC <CrustyBeard> @RealJamesWoods @ScottPresler @Galea430 Because Liberals like me are real Americans, and we don't need Russian bots to make us feel special.
966316144696201223 2018-02-21 14:18:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> If you're more upset about the fact that you lost 100s of followers after the #TwitterLockOut than the fact that you were being followed by 100s of Russian bots, perhaps you're the real problem.
966285515271045120 2018-02-21 12:16:34 UTC <CrustyBeard> If you're upset because you lost 100s of bot followers during the #TwitterLockOut , maybe you just weren't that popular to begin with. The truth isn't mean; it's just the truth....
966283915957850112 2018-02-21 12:10:12 UTC <CrustyBeard> I didn't lose any followers in the #TwitterLockOut because my followers are real Patriotic American Progressives.
966155742112776193 2018-02-20 03:40:53 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DineshDSouza Ladies and Gentlemen, this type of Tweet is what many see as the typical mindset of a Trumpian Conservative.

966010582217515009 2018-02-20 18:04:05 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BillOReilly If you think those highly impassioned and motivated teens can't make a difference in short time in this country, you should try attending a same-sex marriage.

965963177606381568 2018-02-20 14:55:42 UTC <CrustyBeard> Dear @CNN.  Ban Jack Kingston out of common decency to the American people.  Thank you.
965790131897716737 2018-02-19 03:28:05 UTC <CrustyBeard> @MittRomney You know the previous back and forth on Twitter between you two is available for everyone, don't you?  We'll be embarrassing you two over it for months.

965786974052409344 2018-02-19 03:15:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> So, what about today? @MittRomney ?https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/705471184935190532
965763820428853248 2018-02-19 01:43:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> @AndrewBreitbart @gatewaypundit Keep motivating those kids by attacking them, Jim. See how that works out for you.

965754024413876224 2018-02-19 01:04:36 UTC <CrustyBeard> @gatewaypundit @1proud_southern @realJohnnyZipp Holy shit! Kids listening and learning from their parents and teachers is now a bad thing according to Conservatives!!!!!
965753613908881408 2018-02-19 01:02:59 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realJohnnyZipp @gatewaypundit @1proud_southern What's your point, lady? Shouldn't teens take coaching and advice from their parents? Wouldn't a smart kid do that?
965751500109697024 2018-02-19 00:54:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @gatewaypundit That's the problem. Teens aren't getting enough guidance from their parents....pic.twitter.com/O0JRRc906P
965749985215164416 2018-02-19 00:48:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> @benshapiro Yes. But that's because your head is in the sand.
965748890287988737 2018-02-19 00:44:12 UTC <CrustyBeard> @gatewaypundit Good luck attacking teens.  The adults in the room will protect them and make sure you fail.

965700309292060673 2018-02-19 21:31:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DineshDSouza LeBron James is not dumb.  He's also not a convicted felon.

Those are weapons the Fed Govt readily has and uses in combat right now.  That's some awesome foresight on your part, Rachel?
965614741866647553 2018-02-19 15:51:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> Australia has the same video games.  They don't have mass shootings anymore because they banned the guns used in them.https://twitter.com/Newsweek/status/964586465308172290

965597566778970112 2018-02-19 14:42:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @FoxNews 1. Since when has Fox ever promoted regulating anything? 2. No one has ever been shot and killed by a Twitter feed.

965595962814222336 2018-02-19 14:36:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> Emma Gonzalez and her fellow students are going to embarrass the crap out of Congress, the White House and the NRA and they're going to make real change.

965382705109241861 2018-02-18 00:29:07 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BillOReilly Laura doesn't want to listen to LeBron. She told him to "shut up and dribble." How is that allowing for a stronger argument?
965373742137438210 2018-02-18 23:53:30 UTC <CrustyBeard> @SethMacFarlane @valefaronyx Hey, look at the Cowardly Lion.
965351344981860352 2018-02-18 22:24:30 UTC <CrustyBeard> @marcorubio Those kids live in your state.  They and their parents and teachers are your constituents.  Senator, you would be very wise to listen to them.  They deserve an audience with you.
965350375418220544 2018-02-18 22:20:39 UTC <CrustyBeard> Anyone who wants to criticize the teens who are organizing the #marchforourlives would be wise to remember the 5th habit from Stephen R. Covey--Seek first to understand; then be understood. Legislators need to hear and understand where these kids are coming from.
965344874181652482 2018-02-18 21:58:47 UTC <CrustyBeard> @SethAMandel @EdB_Ohio William, I would not be too quick to dismiss these kids. They may shock you with their logic....if you can keep an open mind.
965333967665815553 2018-02-18 21:15:27 UTC <CrustyBeard> @plainjane5555 Well, you're certainly entitled to your uninformed opinions.
965304541246885888 2018-02-18 19:18:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> @plainjane5555 Their parents. It's a well-to-do area. They don't need to be bought.
965303929247551488 2018-02-18 19:16:05 UTC <CrustyBeard> @zeus654 If you're really pro-life, you would support kids who don't want to get shot in school instead of trying to make it about something else. They don't have to be exclusive.
965302804414943234 2018-02-18 19:11:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> Dear @NRA and @GOP, since you always say that immediately after any mass shooting that "it's too soon" to talk about gun control, the survivors in America have set the date. March 24. See you then.
965298027228516353 2018-02-18 18:52:38 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Franklin_Graham So, how did Donald Trump get elected?

965250844420640768 2018-02-18 15:45:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> @KDTrey5 @JOEL9ONE @KingJames @RichRobIII @TerenceStanley4 Terry, what's your job?  Does your boss tell you that you can't go on Twitter and ever talk about politics?  How do you have any more freedom to talk about things than LeBron does?  Just because he's an athlete doesn't mean he can't talk about anything he wants to.
965087368842829824 2018-02-17 04:55:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump Take your meds and go to sleep now, grandpa.
965078235376648193 2018-02-17 04:19:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> @robwhisman There are schools in Oklahoma that are only open 4 days a week now because of budget cuts.  But, let's buy guns for all the teachers who haven't gotten pay raises and can't write off school supply purchases any more....
965077947177684992 2018-02-17 04:18:07 UTC <CrustyBeard> @trollabelle @robwhisman @AvaDeCenizas @Hermit_Thrush You really should pay attention.
965065211819503618 2018-02-17 03:27:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> @cmclymer Because the press knows that politicians have canned answers already.  "Thoughts and prayers" "Deepest sympathies." "Grieving for the victims and their families."  Then, as soon as the press ask when they'll change laws, they give the "too soon to politicize" BS.
965011374949785600 2018-02-17 23:53:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> Dear @CNN, @MSNBC, @FoxNews, @AP, @Reuters, @washingtonpost and @nytimes, etc.  If none of you push her at the next briefing as to why POTUS hasn't imposed the sanctions that Congress passed and he signed, then none of you will have done your jobs.https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/964979194387222528
965010701499674624 2018-02-17 23:50:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @POTUS @PressSec So, why hasn't he imposed the sanctions that Congress overwhelmingly approved and he signed into law?  I really need the press to push her on this.
964998710752108546 2018-02-17 23:03:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley Yeah.  That will work.

964979577130020865 2018-02-17 21:47:14 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IndivisibleTeam Hey, Iowa residents: Remind Grassley that he wrote the bill that allowed the Florida shooter to get his AR-15 so easily.  Ask him why he doesn't feel guilty about what happened there.
964978893936562176 2018-02-17 21:44:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> @robertpatrickT2 I'm a huge Scorpion fan.  And oh, by the way, @MichaelRapaport is awesome on Atypical.

964960313815785472 2018-02-17 20:30:41 UTC <CrustyBeard> @reuben_vel Congrats on setting that up on the tee for me.  You can go away now.
964957650457972741 2018-02-17 20:20:06 UTC <CrustyBeard> @reuben_vel ....With more balls than you have.
964957274782556160 2018-02-17 20:18:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> To the Cons who reply about Emma Gonzalez by saying schools need more armed guards: Who's going to pay for that?  School budgets keep getting cut.  Classrooms are oversized. Teachers are underpaid.  Can't even get adequate supplies. Where's the money for armed guards coming from.
964956636346507265 2018-02-17 20:16:04 UTC <CrustyBeard> @datrumpnation1 School budgets constantly being cut.  Classroom sizes stretched to the limits.  Teachers can't write off school supplies or get pay raises.  Who's going to pay for multiple armed guards? You're so stupid.
964956039543214080 2018-02-17 20:13:42 UTC <CrustyBeard> @datrumpnation1 Her HS had an armed police officer on duty.  How did that work out?  The SRO was called off campus right before that.  Probably by the shooter.
964954936613179394 2018-02-17 20:09:19 UTC <CrustyBeard> Every Con who has Tweeted about Emma Gonzalez and her speech has one thing in common.  They can't argue the facts of what she said.
964954422395666432 2018-02-17 20:07:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> @lindseyvonn @KingJames @KDTrey5 @POTUS @T_W_Haines One thing is obvious from your Tweets.  You can't handle the truth in what she said.
964953624928538624 2018-02-17 20:04:06 UTC <CrustyBeard> @eliza_hermosura It looks to me like Emma Gonzalez has tons more courage than you ever will.
964948976809242625 2018-02-17 19:45:38 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @mschlapp Where guns are prohibited.
964948695463682049 2018-02-17 19:44:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> Dear @GOP, stare into your future.  Your NRA donations will be worn like an albatross around your neck in November.https://twitter.com/MichaelSkolnik/status/964942779767033857

964945477706936320 2018-02-17 19:31:44 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ScottHood63 It was a terrible pattern at USC for the last couple years.
964944859269275648 2018-02-17 19:29:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> @AFP @MisterComposite @JuanGarciaKek Yeah.  You couldn't be anymore wrong.
964944739362582529 2018-02-17 19:28:48 UTC <CrustyBeard> @AFP @MisterComposite And yet, most new Dems running for office nowadays are millennials.  Try again.
964939467856465920 2018-02-17 19:07:51 UTC <CrustyBeard> @AFP @MisterComposite These students are going to be the next wave of voters that will elect people to Congress.  And the RW is making them angry and motivated.  Cons are going to lose an entire generation if they don't change their ways.
964921222332141570 2018-02-17 17:55:21 UTC <CrustyBeard> @dennisdoddcbs Aren't a lot of juvenile offenses sealed?  These are HS kids being recruited.
964901187370745856 2018-02-17 16:35:44 UTC <CrustyBeard> @secupp Any time a brainless Conservative like @SECupp brings up Chicago or DC just say the word "Hawaii" and remind them that unlike DC or Chicago, you can't drive guns there across the border.https://twitter.com/secupp/status/964387793584599043
964900392797655040 2018-02-17 16:32:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @secupp @johnlegend She also conveniently leaves out Hawaii, with it's strong gun laws and the fact that it's on a series of islands you can't drive to with guns in your vehicle. And sure enough, Hawaii has the lowest rate of firearm deaths of any state. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_death_rates_in_the_United_States_by_state

964897317479428098 2018-02-17 16:20:22 UTC <CrustyBeard> @secupp Do you know what part of America has strong gun laws and doesn't have mass shootings?  Hawaii.  Because unlike Chicago, you can't drive there from Indiana. #UseLogicSE
964890788462198784 2018-02-17 15:54:25 UTC <CrustyBeard> Since I never watch @FoxNews, let me guess: No one there called him out on that or even bothered to question it.  Fair and Balanced.  Am I right?https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/964868564040765442
964890420772769792 2018-02-17 15:52:57 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BillKristol Short answer: Yes
964882189325340672 2018-02-17 15:20:15 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @charliekirk11 The NRA is the only organization in America that lobbied for the end of the assault weapon ban.  So, yeah. This is on them. Republicans are going to wear their NRA donations like an albatross around their necks in the midterms.
964878655502635009 2018-02-17 15:06:12 UTC <CrustyBeard> @FoxNews Now that @foxnews can't deny the Russia story anymore, the talking point has pivoted to blaming it on Obama.  Anything to deflect from Saint Donald.https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/964875008165150720
964707565203591170 2018-02-16 03:46:21 UTC <CrustyBeard> @RajShah45 @FoxNews Except the indictment specifically says the Russians intended to support Trump over Hillary Clinton.
964645907592564737 2018-02-16 23:41:21 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BettyBowers I told Jack Posobiac that Mueller is playing high-level chess and he's playing tiddly winks.  Mueller is simply setting the board up for the checkmate, and Cons are six moves behind.
964638369916563456 2018-02-16 23:11:24 UTC <CrustyBeard> Ummmmm....no.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/884016887692234753
964638007843278849 2018-02-16 23:09:57 UTC <CrustyBeard> @amber_athey Here's a thought: Maybe those anti-gun teenagers were encouraged to vote for anti-gun politicians after their school mates and teachers were shot by a Pro-Trump member of a white supremacist group. Have you considered that?
964636821853437957 2018-02-16 23:05:15 UTC <CrustyBeard> @amber_athey What is wrong with encouraging kids who are about to be 18 to vote?  Journalist or not?  Shouldn't every American be encouraging people who legally can vote to do so?
964635853598478336 2018-02-16 23:01:24 UTC <CrustyBeard> @brianstelter @DailyCaller 13 Russian individuals and 3 companies indicted, and this is the best you can do.  I guess it's hard when the Internet Research Agency isn't writing your content.
964635206539005952 2018-02-16 22:58:49 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Bencjacobs It took me a minute to get this.  Then, I remembered what Trump said.
964610360354500608 2018-02-16 21:20:06 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JackPosobiec @NateKyng Oooooh. Snappy.
964608550222946304 2018-02-16 21:12:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JackPosobiec @clarity_lover1 Care to place a bet on that?
964608362150285315 2018-02-16 21:12:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JackPosobiec @NateKyng It's Mueller's court. He chooses the game.
964577462670774273 2018-02-16 19:09:22 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JackPosobiec Jack, Mueller is playing high-level chess right now, and you're playing tiddly winks.  The board is being set up by him, and you're six moves behind.
964577237398941702 2018-02-16 19:08:29 UTC <CrustyBeard> Mueller is playing seven-level chess right now, and Jack is playing tiddly winks.https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/964574355719147520

964571487448584197 2018-02-16 18:45:38 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Finitedirt I don't follow her.  I could care less what she thinks.  I'm capable of using my own brain to complete my own thoughts.
964571138503344128 2018-02-16 18:44:14 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Finitedirt Is it beard or hat?  You can't keep up.
964571038284763136 2018-02-16 18:43:51 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Finitedirt Collusion is an all-encompassing term.  It can cover conspiracy, Logan Act violations, campaign finance laws and fraud.  The point is that these indictments by Mueller are setting up the proof of the connection between the Russians and the Trump campaign.
964569770824814592 2018-02-16 18:38:48 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Finitedirt It's your.
964569353260879872 2018-02-16 18:37:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Finitedirt I don't think you fail to realize how this is going to play out.  The indictments are merely the next step towards proving collusion.  These Russians worked with the Trump campaign to do this.  Mueller is setting up the pieces on the chess board to prove collusion.  Follow along.
964568995268562945 2018-02-16 18:35:43 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Finitedirt Perhaps you should re-read the indictment. And take a legal course while your at it.

If you really want to do this, I'll send you images of the indictment which show everything I said.  Here's the first one--identity theft.  So again, if you want to go down this road, let's go.pic.twitter.com/gP8MbBfsVV
964564004633968640 2018-02-16 18:15:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Finitedirt Your argument would have a valid point except they were charged with identity theft, campaign finance violations, conspiracy and failing to register as foreign agents--none of which applies to the 1st Amendment.

I'm not surprised Rob Porter had access to classified materials because no one in the Trump admin wanted to wait for him to get cleared. They take shortcuts.

961271481912168454 2018-02-07 16:12:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> There are a million things you can do for our Armed Forces before having a #militaryparade. You can donate to the USO. You can volunteer at a homeless shelter for veterans. You can support other charities.  A parade is a banana-republic stunt that doesn't belong in America.

The two are not mutually exclusive.  Some of us just believe that military parades are third-world propaganda BS that have no place in America.

959868480358055938 2018-02-03 19:17:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BryanJFischer @SoTrophyHntrs Then explain how Larry Nassar was able to fool people for 30 years despite all the warning signs.  There were warning signs with Moore also.  Like getting banned from the mall.  So, wake up.
959845764385116160 2018-02-03 17:47:17 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BryanJFischer @SoTrophyHntrs That's the only money she's seeking. She's not trying to get rich off him. That's the point.
959830808424001541 2018-02-03 16:47:52 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BryanJFischer And don't claim she's doing it for money.  She's only seeking attorney's fees, an apology and a court order requiring Moore to stop defaming her.https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/05/roy-moore-defamation-suit-accuser-leigh-corfman-326366
959830222542704644 2018-02-03 16:45:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BryanJFischer Is that why one of the women is currently suing Moore and Moore is left begging for money to defend the lawsuit?

959515761365733379 2018-02-02 19:55:59 UTC <CrustyBeard> If The Nunes memo was all that great and damaging, the GOP would have never dumped it on the Friday before the Super Bowl.  Enjoy Impeachment, y'all.

956229474621755393 2018-01-24 18:17:27 UTC <CrustyBeard> This is why the judge gave him 175 years.  To ensure that he would never live long enough to be eligible for parole.https://twitter.com/BobLeyESPN/status/956226148702277632

956226492064780288 2018-01-24 18:05:36 UTC <CrustyBeard> @assassinbyblood The point is to make sure he never gets paroled.  Paroles can be based on the length of the sentence.  The longer the sentence, the longer it takes to be eligible for parole.  By making it 175 years, he'll never get a parole hearing.
956208813358637056 2018-01-24 16:55:21 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ToddFuhrman South Carolina as a 2 Seed to win the NCAA tournament after beating Kentucky twice in the regular season.  They lost to Coppin State in the first round. Last sports bet I ever made.

955172026246926338 2018-01-21 20:15:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WarnerGary Dems have always raised money differently.  The RNC does it through them first.  Dems don't raise it through one centralized committee.  That comparison has always been apples to oranges.
955170115099746304 2018-01-21 20:07:56 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WarnerGary Ten months.  Ten months to campaign.
955169947696721921 2018-01-21 20:07:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WarnerGary Besides, every avalanche starts small.
955169667148058628 2018-01-21 20:06:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WarnerGary Yes.  The GOP was favored in all 4.  Had to spend major money to hold on to the others.  Speaking of temper tantrums, has Moore conceded yet?  VA Delegate house was heavily gerrymandered. Only drawing a name out of a bowl allowed them to keep a majority.
955168588641587200 2018-01-21 20:01:52 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WarnerGary Elections aren't won by responses to SOTU speeches.  All politics are local.  Resistance groups are organizing at local levels.  That's where it will be won.  They won't win every race, but they will take many GOP seats back like they already have.
955164468513779713 2018-01-21 19:45:30 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WarnerGary So, just like Dems were surprised when Tea Partiers got elected up and down the ballot, don't you be surprised when Resistance members start winning like they did in Virginia and in Alabama and in the state Senate race in Wisconsin last week.
955159517389520897 2018-01-21 19:25:49 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WarnerGary We felt the same away about the Tea Party when Obama was elected. Then they started winning races for office. Now the tide is turning.
955150036643536896 2018-01-21 18:48:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WarnerGary Not everyone believes he was elected fair and square, so that's why we're Resisting. You should get used to it.

955091977753845768 2018-01-21 14:57:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DCjusticeseeker Trump can insult anyone he wants, and you defend him.  Duckworth gives him the perfect nickname and you call her weak.  What a pussy you are.  Go away you piece of shit ass-kisser.
955091095159033857 2018-01-21 14:53:56 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DCjusticeseeker Oh, really, MAGAt?  Even with two prosthetic legs, Tammy Duckworth could run circles around Trump and you know it. And the women around Trump are just "alternative facts" givers--Sarah Sanders and Kellyann Conway. They couldn't tell the truth if their lives depended on it.
954893999667662850 2018-01-20 01:50:45 UTC <CrustyBeard> @jaketapper And the biggest cowards are USA Gymnastics, the USOC and the leaders at Michigan State University that all turned their heads the other way when they were warned about Nassar.
954893671874400262 2018-01-20 01:49:27 UTC <CrustyBeard> On the day of #WomensMarch2018 , Sen. Duckworth calls Trump #CadetBoneSpurs.  Let's remind him of who he is and who #TheResistance are!
954892249338470400 2018-01-20 01:43:47 UTC <CrustyBeard> #CadetBoneSpurs needs to trend all night.
954889730033889280 2018-01-20 01:33:47 UTC <CrustyBeard> @markos Cadet Bone Spurs needs to be his nickname from now on.
954889118911221760 2018-01-20 01:31:21 UTC <CrustyBeard> Trump hates strong women. For Senator Tammy Duckworth to call him "Cadet Bone Spurs" will get under his skin like nothing else.
954864161871335424 2018-01-20 23:52:11 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JohnCornyn That email says you RT'd Russian bots. Way to admit your screw ups, Senator.
954823385854496771 2018-01-20 21:10:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> @TheRickyDavila @nycbubbles @RiversideWeekly Hey, Steve.  If you want to practice Christian Values, perhaps you could start with the Golden Rule.  You know..the one taught by Christ himself.
954793434803556352 2018-01-20 19:11:08 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JW_Watch So, it's not just Russian propaganda. It's blatant lies on top of it. That stupid people believe.
954792885391626240 2018-01-20 19:08:57 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JW_Watch Yeah. You're wrong about all of that.

954755367132712960 2018-01-20 16:39:52 UTC <CrustyBeard> @MarkSteynOnline @FoxNews Yes, Mark.  And as long as you demonize them, they'll be voting Dem in the future and ruining the GOP.  You might want to consider that.

954415645923381248 2018-01-19 18:09:56 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ToddDracula @CathyDice1 Exact quote: "Right now, in a number of states, there are laws that allow a baby to be born from his or her mother's womb in the 9th month.  It is wrong. It has to change." So, babies should no longer be born in the 9th month of pregnancy....

950484134547415040 2018-01-08 21:47:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> @MattMitovich I'm guessing "Seattle Fire" is out of the question.
950453034127167488 2018-01-08 19:43:56 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ralphDrussoAP I have a hard accepting facts whenever Florida prematurely declares anyone the winner.
950440392553566208 2018-01-08 18:53:42 UTC <CrustyBeard> @celebrityhottub Hey, you saw South Carolina in person on New Years Day, so the Gamecocks deserve it first.
950440111195459584 2018-01-08 18:52:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @TimCowlishaw @mark_swindell Playoffs are a different animal than a regular season game in October.
950437380665769984 2018-01-08 18:41:44 UTC <CrustyBeard> @TimCowlishaw @mark_swindell Oh, and don't tell me Matt Ryan can't play in Philadelphia since he was only born and raised there.
950436793891147778 2018-01-08 18:39:24 UTC <CrustyBeard> @TimCowlishaw @mark_swindell Falcons have lots of playoff experience that Philly does not.
950435069289816064 2018-01-08 18:32:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> @TimCowlishaw @mark_swindell No Carson Wentz makes Philly much weaker.
950429093048258560 2018-01-08 18:08:48 UTC <CrustyBeard> @jaketapper @bigdaddy42011 That was a very intelligent and eloquent Tweet.
950410832059535361 2018-01-08 16:56:14 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mattyglesias DREAMers don't qualify for that.
950410173365014528 2018-01-08 16:53:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mattyglesias Deferred action while waiting on legislative action.  The only hope is for those businesses to pressure Congress to act.
950407475441922048 2018-01-08 16:42:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mattyglesias DACA was that EO.  Obama issued it in 2012, and Trump overturned it last September.  Use Google to do a little research before you Tweet, dude.
950406954043703297 2018-01-08 16:40:50 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mattyglesias Most of them have temporary work permits that were granted by an EO by Obama.  But, Trump overturned that EO, and it's set to expire unless Congress acts.
950406534860767232 2018-01-08 16:39:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mattyglesias Congress has to pass a law to make that happen.  Trump surely won't do it alone.  And what part of this dysfunctional Congress we have makes you think they'll do it easily?
950406255776059392 2018-01-08 16:38:03 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mattyglesias There's no law that allows them to do that.  It's not an option. That's why Congress needs to pass something.  The law prohibits you from getting a visa if you came here illegally.  These kids were brought here illegally.  That's the point. They can't get a visa.
950405619617554433 2018-01-08 16:35:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JustADudeFromTN And you just know all this how exactly?
950404361963925504 2018-01-08 16:30:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mattyglesias Really, Andrew.  Kindly explain the current legal process for Dreamers.  Explain what statute exists for them to follow.  I'll wait.
950380885853069312 2018-01-08 14:57:15 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Karnythia I don't recall Oprah ever throwing a possibility of running out there.  It's just fans hoping for anything that is anti-Trump.  Dems can find realistic candidates to run in 2020.
950376937213526016 2018-01-08 14:41:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> @celiacole @DMendelsohn1960 John Hickenlooper.  He is one politician who was also a successful businessman who is well respected and would be highly supported by Liberals and moderates in the Democratic party.

950162345371762688 2018-01-07 00:28:50 UTC <CrustyBeard> @nbc @NBCNews Maybe you should be paying Savannah and Hotb what you paid Matt Lauer.

950063509777285120 2018-01-07 17:56:06 UTC <CrustyBeard> @politico Now that the money spigot has been cut off, Bannon can't kiss ass fast enough to get back in the Trumpers' good graces.
950062746615336968 2018-01-07 17:53:04 UTC <CrustyBeard> @jaketapper Once again, there literally is a Donald Trump tweet for every occasion.

949671803298906113 2018-01-06 15:59:36 UTC <CrustyBeard> @GOP Keep talking about.  You're only helping him sell more copies.
949671469562425345 2018-01-06 15:58:17 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump Seriously.  Your Tweets about that book should be on the cover.  You're doing more to help sell copies than Wolff could do.  I hope he sends you part of the royalties.
949654965445853184 2018-01-06 14:52:42 UTC <CrustyBeard> Hello, America.  I'm Donald Trump.  Your #stablegenius President.  Don't buy that book.  Seriously, don't buy it.  Forget it was ever written.  It's Fake News. Prosecute Crooked Hillary.  No Collusion.  Rocket Man! Did I mention #stablegenius ?
949457746096807936 2018-01-05 01:49:01 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NYPost_Brazille It's not that warmer here.
949456732681592832 2018-01-05 01:44:59 UTC <CrustyBeard> @RSwaringin Says the people who want to jail Hillary over three different things that have no evidence to support them.

949288503363424257 2018-01-05 14:36:30 UTC <CrustyBeard> @FoxNewsResearch Which means 2017 was the worst year for job growth since 2010.  Man, that President who was in office during those previous six years did an amazing job.
949071170359488513 2018-01-04 00:12:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @EWErickson If Miller is so brilliant, how come these travel ban EO's keep getting the crap kicked out of them in Federal Court?

949015154989174784 2018-01-04 20:30:19 UTC <CrustyBeard> @keithellison You want to make GOP heads spin in South Carolina?  Tell them we're going to start drilling right off the coast of Hilton Head.
949014254421757952 2018-01-04 20:26:44 UTC <CrustyBeard> @keithellison Every Republican is for off-shore drilling until it's about to be done off their beach.  Just like they're all for fracking until it's about to be done right next to their land.
949013935671468032 2018-01-04 20:25:28 UTC <CrustyBeard> @MSignorile I ordered a copy on Amazon today just because of Trump's actions.

948945468163321857 2018-01-04 15:53:24 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump Fact: Most states have privacy laws that prevented them from giving that information over.  That includes many Republican states like Georgia, where I live.
948944964158976001 2018-01-04 15:51:24 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump @hmileski @17LadyLiberty76 Would you care to explain how they could possibly apply for legal citizenship?  What law allows them to do that?
948939668841811969 2018-01-04 15:30:22 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mattmfm And Colorado.
948930321784999937 2018-01-04 14:53:13 UTC <CrustyBeard> @studentactivism @gato_danger Nationally, you are right. Dems are not that organized.  But, locally, they've been doing a much better job of it in the last six months.  That will increase over the course of 2018.  It played out in VA and NJ and even in Alabama.  Watch how it plays out over the rest of the US.
948929754178248706 2018-01-04 14:50:58 UTC <CrustyBeard> @studentactivism @laserdog It's called a "campaigning platform."  It's one more way for Dems to campaign against the GOP in 2018.
948923365720543232 2018-01-04 14:25:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump @HenryHolt @CarolLeonnig Yeah.  Good luck with that.

948659578572627968 2018-01-03 20:57:23 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump @EPAScottPruitt @CongHuelskamp Kudos to you Congressman, for not giving a rat's ass about the planet that God created.
948651520291196928 2018-01-03 20:25:22 UTC <CrustyBeard> Does anyone remember the good old days when were just making fun of the Vice President for accidentally shooting his friend in the face?
948650551868305409 2018-01-03 20:21:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> The President of the United States and his former Chief Adviser and campaign head are currently engaged in a full-scale pissing match.  Takes that whole "whose nuclear button is bigger" right off the front page....
948633687415054337 2018-01-03 19:14:30 UTC <CrustyBeard> I'd tell Steve Bannon and Donald Trump to settle it like real men, but we all know neither one of them falls under that category.
948587176605966336 2018-01-03 16:09:41 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Twitter @EricTrump It's an algorithm based on who you talk about the most.  Why do you talk so much about Ellen?  Do you like her show?
948586171055132672 2018-01-03 16:05:41 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JackPosobiec Not trust.  Just be seen the evidence and make up our own minds.
948585515443458048 2018-01-03 16:03:05 UTC <CrustyBeard> Let's be clear.  Steve Bannon isn't a new part of #TheResistance.  He's just a racist troll trying to save his own ass while he rolls everyone else under the bus.  However, I do believe he has some receipts.  He's just waiting on the time to cash them in.

948214002366246912 2018-01-02 15:26:49 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump Wait. Are you trying to say that strongly regulating industry is a good thing?

947268420634103808 2017-12-30 00:49:25 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JeffSchultzAJC Let's ask the Utah Jazz how that knocked Michael Jordan off his game.
947246047809728519 2017-12-30 23:20:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> @SheriffClarke Shouldn't you be settling a lawsuit somewhere?
947235840652185602 2017-12-30 22:39:57 UTC <CrustyBeard> @es_snipes @DelShores @amrebellion Oh no. Thank you. When my wife now wants to see examples of stupid Trump voters, I've got your Tweets saved to show her.
947214815612764165 2017-12-30 21:16:25 UTC <CrustyBeard> @AndyRichter @terminsane You see, good sir, when smart people see someone post a ridiculous statement, we insist you prove it by providing links to these so-called articles. Failure to do so shows you are full of crap. So post links or admit you're full of crap.
947212589712527364 2017-12-30 21:07:34 UTC <CrustyBeard> @AndyRichter @terminsane Please link five of those articles that you say come out every day.

947200231606816768 2017-12-30 20:18:28 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ConservGayGuy @elizabetrepp1 Really?  As governor of Indiana, he signed one of the biggest anti-LGBT/pro-Christian bigotry laws in America.  Are you really that dense?
947199767402221569 2017-12-30 20:16:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ConservGayGuy @MeOnAJourney How is wanting equality for all divisive?  Explain in a logical, non name-calling manner, please.
947199285535432706 2017-12-30 20:14:42 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ConservGayGuy If you aren't smart enough to see the irony in the fact that Gay is literally part of your Twitter identity, than we can't help you.

947134122056736769 2017-12-30 15:55:46 UTC <CrustyBeard> @nytmike @peterbakernyt We'll believe you when you and everyone at the Times take the criticism to heart.  Don't be a note taker during a Trump interview. Be a fricking journalist.
946921215901478912 2017-12-29 01:49:45 UTC <CrustyBeard> @nytmike @peterbakernyt It's also hard to accept that the only way he got to speak with Trump is because Mike was eating lunch with the head of Newsmax.
946920897226649600 2017-12-29 01:48:29 UTC <CrustyBeard> @nytmike @peterbakernyt The problem we have is that the excuse constantly given for not questioning Trump is his rambling and allowing him to keep doing that.  A reporter's job is to ask questions.  Hold him accountable for his lies and ask him hard questions.  Is that too much to ask of you?
946911551063232512 2017-12-29 01:11:21 UTC <CrustyBeard> @YahooForde Pun the damn ball and play defense.

946468705403310080 2017-12-28 19:51:38 UTC <CrustyBeard> Hey, if you're going to Tweet about Democrat Doug Jones officially being certified the winner, can you not post a photo of his pedophile Republican opponent who lost and refuses to accept that he lost?
946468188367269889 2017-12-28 19:49:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @trytotakethem Like the KKK? Because Doug Jones already sent two of them to prison years ago.
946462062141755392 2017-12-28 19:25:14 UTC <CrustyBeard> @CollinRugg You Conservatives are hilarious.  Every intelligence agency says Russia interfered in the 2016 Presidential election, and you don't want to investigate any of it.  Yet, the GOP Secretary of State in AL says no fraud happened and you want to hold up the Alabama Senate election.
946408679330467840 2017-12-28 15:53:07 UTC <CrustyBeard> You Conservatives are hilarious.

946400732928004096 2017-12-28 15:21:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Imperator_Rex3 @foster2adoptof4 Care to explain how all those people got legitimate looking Alabama ID cards in order to cast votes while making sure the actual registered voters didn't show up and cast ballots?  It's impossible to pull off.
946400377401995264 2017-12-28 15:20:07 UTC <CrustyBeard> @robertrobq Oh, please.  He  has no credible evidence.  Part of his filing was the comment section of a Breitbart article.  I'm not making that up.  His whole filing was a joke written by an idiot with no legal training.
946397712378888194 2017-12-28 15:09:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> @FightNowAmerica Considering the statutes of limitations have long ago expired, and the women said in the beginning they were not seeking fame, just to tell the truth, there's nothing more to hear.  #Logical

945704771817824256 2017-12-26 17:16:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> @cmahar3 Where I live, they're also homemakers, school teachers, nurses and other individuals who help guide young minds who will be future voters.

945702038100471810 2017-12-26 17:05:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> @hollyjoidaho @cmahar3 @cyanideann For this conversation you're about as useful as an ashtray on a bicycle.
945701739600244736 2017-12-26 17:03:59 UTC <CrustyBeard> @hollyjoidaho @cmahar3 Hey, look who's Googling RW talking points from Twitchy.

945701177785712643 2017-12-26 17:01:45 UTC <CrustyBeard> @cmahar3 @hollyjoidaho I used to be pro-life.  Then, I met Trump voters.
945700570521849858 2017-12-26 16:59:20 UTC <CrustyBeard> @hollyjoidaho @cmahar3 And you've worked your entire life to be an asshole.  Why not take the day off?
945699995604439041 2017-12-26 16:57:03 UTC <CrustyBeard> @hollyjoidaho @cmahar3 @cyanideann Sorry you can't write eloquently enough.

945698420030935040 2017-12-26 16:50:48 UTC <CrustyBeard> @hollyjoidaho @cmahar3 This is the Conservative view point in a nutshell.  Who cares what we destroy forever, strip from or build over as long as we can make money right now from it?
945697722870484992 2017-12-26 16:48:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> @hollyjoidaho @cmahar3 Yes, what we need to do is tear down paradise to put up a parking lot.  Makes complete sense.
945697093812924416 2017-12-26 16:45:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> @hollyjoidaho @cmahar3 Tell that to the other members of God's creatures who live on that land and depend on it for their survival.  Or is it strictly about what you can use it for?
945696830934970370 2017-12-26 16:44:29 UTC <CrustyBeard> @cmahar3 Narrator: In addition, most of the components were recycled.  Also, the previous poster threatened to shoot anyone who wanted to frack any where near where he lives.
945690267520327681 2017-12-26 16:18:24 UTC <CrustyBeard> @hollyjoidaho @cmahar3 So, maybe we don't want your greedy, corporate first, strip the environment, dirty hands on our public lands.  That's why they're called public lands (YOUR WORDS.)
945689278826377216 2017-12-26 16:14:28 UTC <CrustyBeard> @hollyjoidaho @cmahar3 What part of public lands (your own words) don't you understand means not privately owned by corporations to drill on?

945668679223693312 2017-12-26 14:52:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> @foxandfrlends @realDonaldTrump You know there are other channels on the TV besides Fox News.  You should try watching Nickelodeon with your son.

943914057282801667 2017-12-21 18:40:22 UTC <CrustyBeard> Yes, Sean Hannity actually Tweeted at NBC News and told them to read an article that he linked that was published by NBC News.  You can't make this shit up.pic.twitter.com/wk2Lavp7Jp

943874769799147520 2017-12-21 16:04:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> @EsotericCD This post against Doug Jones's son is repulsive.  It only proves that the people who voted for Jones or wrote in names instead of Moore did the right thing.  As for conceding, who cares if he does?  All I care is that Jones will be sworn in as Senator.

942727921642418176 2017-12-18 12:07:06 UTC <CrustyBeard> @FoxNews So, why don't they go to court to get the evidence suppressed like real lawyers do?  Oh, it's because they don't have a valid legal argument.

942481348635308032 2017-12-17 19:47:18 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mitchellvii Pretty obvious you can't tie your own shoes.
942425598001074176 2017-12-17 16:05:46 UTC <CrustyBeard> Words Democrats never banned:  Merry Christmas Words Republicans have banned: Fetus Diversity Evidence-based Science-based Transgender Vulnerable Entitlement #CDC7words #TakeBackAmerica
942423647419031552 2017-12-17 15:58:01 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ralphDrussoAP I nailed the Georgia State win.  I went 5-1 (Ark St. let me down.)
942121544540663808 2017-12-16 19:57:34 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JohnCornyn Yes he does.
942107272225882114 2017-12-16 19:00:51 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JohnCornyn Mueller fired them that same day.  Trump kept Flynn in office for 26 extra days.  Care to justify that, Senator?  I'm betting you can't.
942106181136510976 2017-12-16 18:56:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> Every day the Trump Administration does something like #CDC7words all they do is create more Democratic Party candidates and voters.
942105947991957509 2017-12-16 18:55:36 UTC <CrustyBeard> Dear @realDonaldTrump and @GOP, 1. Diversity 2. Entitlement 3. Evidence-based 4. Fetus 5. Science-based 6. Transgender 7. Vulnerable  You will not silence anyone. #CDC7words
941742707147452416 2017-12-15 18:52:12 UTC <CrustyBeard> @mitchellvii Yes, Gen. Soros arranged for 1000s of black voters from MS with AL ID cards that matched registered voters and steered them to the exact precincts of those registered voters and got them to cast ballots while no one with an iPhone was allowed to photograph the busses.  All legit.
941721002735742976 2017-12-15 17:25:58 UTC <CrustyBeard> Let's all make a deal.  If you see anyone who ReTweets Ann Coulter, block them.  No matter who it is.
941672986091892736 2017-12-15 14:15:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> @davidaxelrod I've never taken the LSAT or stepped foot in a law school classroom, but I'm pretty sure I could answer some of those questions better than he can.  How do these people get nominated?
941671912723369984 2017-12-15 14:10:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> The Internet Is Free Again is the bullshit line put up by the RW.  Wait until they see how much it's going to cost them to read and post on Breitbart. That's when the bitching on their end will begin.
941477043165913088 2017-12-14 01:16:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DonaldJTrumpJr Your father appointed him, Dip Shit.  And yes, most of us can explain it a lot better than you can.
941434322388647938 2017-12-14 22:26:48 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JacobAWohl They're called children, dick weed.
941404565852827650 2017-12-14 20:28:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Well, you're the fringe.  Gotta run, have errands to do.  Take care.
941404345488281600 2017-12-14 20:27:41 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Regulations and building codes make sure that it's done right.  But, keep telling me how that's a bad thing.
941404108073947136 2017-12-14 20:26:44 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Without building inspectors, how would you know the builder didn't cut corners, use cheaper materials inside the walls, fail to properly ground electrical lines, not let the ground sit properly, use proper anchors for the roof, etc?  Most wouldn't.
941403642715869189 2017-12-14 20:24:53 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer I never brought up healthcare.  That's off topic.
941403517855682560 2017-12-14 20:24:23 UTC <CrustyBeard> Attention: @chloepeifer.  There's a lot of Red states on that list--Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Kentucky, North Carolina....https://twitter.com/EdKrassen/status/941395790605508609
941402547042050048 2017-12-14 20:20:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Stop with the red herrings and stay on topic.
941401975136178176 2017-12-14 20:18:15 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair and tell me how you wouldn't want the meat-packing industry regulated by the FDA and USDA.  Would you live in a house that wasn't built to codes as mandated by the government?  Regulations are necessary for the public's safety.
941401309609160709 2017-12-14 20:15:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer You just got twisted up in your own logic and you're not even aware enough to realize it.
941401074480680965 2017-12-14 20:14:41 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer And now it's a monopoly that you said most likely doesn't exist.  Talk about intellectual inconsistency....................
941400652210688001 2017-12-14 20:13:00 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Yes I can.  And I doubt you want to live in a world where electric companies are not regulated.
941400338732593152 2017-12-14 20:11:45 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Verizon, Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile are all private companies that own the phone networks.  They're all regulated in the public interest.
941400006917001216 2017-12-14 20:10:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Most electric companies are privately owned.  Telephone companies are privately owned.  They still are regulated by the government for the public's interests.
941399633896656896 2017-12-14 20:08:57 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer We used to have two satellite radio companies to choose from: Sirius and XM.  Now we have one--SiriusXM.  Don't let facts interfere in your argument about monopolies.
941399306665451520 2017-12-14 20:07:39 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Disney just bought 21st Century Fox studios TODAY. AT&T is buying Time Warner. Don't let facts like that get in the way of your argument that monopolies don't occur in a free market.
941398897586524160 2017-12-14 20:06:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Highways and railways are used to deliver goods to all Americans.  The internet is used for commerce and to deliver information to all Americans.  Highways are regulated.  So should the internet be.  For the greater good of all Americans.
941398603398074370 2017-12-14 20:04:52 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer You're going off an another topic entirely. This is about regulating the internet as a utility like all other utilities are regulated.  If the internet is the Information Highway, it needs to be regulated like actual highways are.
941398109212508161 2017-12-14 20:02:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer History has proven me right.  We had one choice in phone companies before the breakup of Ma Bell in 1982.  Technology has increased multi-fold since then and many credit that for it.
941396773884612608 2017-12-14 19:57:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @FCC @tombellino @stan_spencer422 Son, you ain't too bright.
941395759735476224 2017-12-14 19:53:34 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer If anything, lack of regulations hurts capitalism because it allows monopolies to control everything.
941395097794633730 2017-12-14 19:50:56 UTC <CrustyBeard> @MMsharbono No Dem put the gun in his hand.
941394761591730176 2017-12-14 19:49:36 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Regulated internet doesn't throttle capitalism one tiny bit.
941394596529102849 2017-12-14 19:48:56 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Food and drugs are regulated for the public's benefit.  All cars have safety standards.  None of that throttles capitalism.
941394264960925696 2017-12-14 19:47:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer We believe the internet is a utility and should be regulated as such.
941394041341693952 2017-12-14 19:46:44 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Be wary about pre-judging people.
941393921627869189 2017-12-14 19:46:15 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer We're all Capitalists.  We just believe many regulations are necessary for the greater good.
941390114063872000 2017-12-14 19:31:08 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Very Proud Liberal Democrat.  But, that doesn't matter.  I know plenty of Conservatives that don't like it either.  Including IT workers.
941388069814579200 2017-12-14 19:23:00 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Bandwidth is bandwidth, no matter what the contents are.  Weight is weight, no matter what the contents are.  Eliminating Net Neutrality allows ISP's to charge on the content and not the bandwidth.  That's BS.
941387726968025088 2017-12-14 19:21:38 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Electric companies can't charge you more because of what brand of refrigerator you use.  Yet, you want ISP's to charge more based on what internet sites you visit.  That makes no practical sense. 3)
941387497904508931 2017-12-14 19:20:44 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer Eliminating net neutrality allows ISP's to look into the contents of the deliverable and decide to charge based on that.  That's an unfair act as part of the concept of Common Carrier principles.  2)
941386605113368576 2017-12-14 19:17:11 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer That's all fine and dandy, but you're overlooking one important part.  It's not the weight of the shipment, it's the contents that make up the weight.  Five pounds of dumbells is not same as five pounds of diamonds.  Shipping prices are based on weight. 1)
941385661428502533 2017-12-14 19:13:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer You can.  Just remember, I've got counterpoints ready.
941384955095117825 2017-12-14 19:10:38 UTC <CrustyBeard> @chloepeifer I'll bet you can't enlighten people as to why this is good.
941384588177354754 2017-12-14 19:09:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> Hey, @AjitPaiFCC, I hope you saved money in the budget to defend this shit in court.  If it was up to me, the legal costs would come straight out of your bank account.  #netneutrality
941373877581697025 2017-12-14 18:26:36 UTC <CrustyBeard> Hey, @realDonaldTrump , how will your fans be able to read your Tweets without #NetNeutrality?  Thought of that yet?
941339424461410304 2017-12-14 16:09:42 UTC <CrustyBeard> @trentjacobs That wasn't Athens.  It was Barrow County/Winder.
941329083597774848 2017-12-14 15:28:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> If the FCC ends #netneutrality, I'm just going to make some popcorn and then wait to see the look on @AjitPaiFCC 's face after the shit hits the fan and blows back into Donald Trump's face. The clapback from Trump to Pai will be beautiful to watch.

940810534944985090 2017-12-12 05:08:05 UTC <CrustyBeard> @StockMonsterVIP Or you could thank the primary voters who nominated a shitty candidate. Your choice b
940809465221275648 2017-12-12 05:03:50 UTC <CrustyBeard> Hey, @nytimes and @washingtonpost , the next voter group stories you write better be about African American women.  Like tomorrow.
940792711589842944 2017-12-12 03:57:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> Rick Santorum lost his last Senate race in PA by 18 points. Why does anyone give a rat's ass what he thinks about the Alabama race?
940791951149944832 2017-12-12 03:54:14 UTC <CrustyBeard> Can you imagine what type of voter suppression bills are going to be introduced in Southern states tomorrow?

940789918065987586 2017-12-12 03:46:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> Don't Retweet this because @realDonaldTrump will hate it, but he went 0-2 in the #AlabamaSenateElection. First he endorsed Luther Strange in the primary, and then he endorsed Roy Moore in the general election.  SAD!!!!
940788310460588033 2017-12-12 03:39:46 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WilkowMajority Nah....Steve Bannon campaigning for Moore helped.

940715352954155009 2017-12-12 22:49:52 UTC <CrustyBeard> @pattonoswalt They also spelled your last name wrong.

940598223223361536 2017-12-12 15:04:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> @MSignorile I always mute them unless they become threatening.  Then, I block.  I also blocked Peter LaBarbera right after he followed me completely out of the blue.  I never gave him a chance to read my TL.

940589469530550277 2017-12-12 14:29:39 UTC <CrustyBeard> Dear Alabama.  Do the right thing and vote for Doug Jones.  Don't just elect Moore to cut off your nose to spite everyone else's face.
940588621874323456 2017-12-12 14:26:17 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JerryFalwellJr If I were to vote for a pedophile, my conscience would bother me.  Severely.
940584363334471680 2017-12-12 14:09:22 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JohnFugelsang Bannon also insulted the college that Joe Scarborough went to last night.  Joe went to the University of Alabama.  As in Roll Tide.
940583933384773635 2017-12-12 14:07:39 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump Really?  You never met a women who competed on The Apprentice?  You never met a Miss USA pageant contestant?  Do you expect us to believe that bull shit?
940582875832967168 2017-12-12 14:03:27 UTC <CrustyBeard> @morningmika @JoeNBC Do you mean the guy next to Mika who graduated from the University of Alabama and actually lived in the state?
940582659985637376 2017-12-12 14:02:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @morningmika @NotfakeMSNBC Based on your Twitter handle, I'd say you're seriously obsessed with Mika.  You should try getting a life.....unless you're a paid Russian Troll, and then I'm sorry if that is your life.

940306277539950592 2017-12-11 19:44:21 UTC <CrustyBeard> @PressSec @jeneps Please tell us again how Trump won the Electoral College by the biggest margin since Ronald Reagan.
940229004665204736 2017-12-11 14:37:17 UTC <CrustyBeard> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump There was just a bombing in NYC.  Shouldn't you be focused on that and not the Times?  What the hell do you do that's productive?
940224487353737216 2017-12-11 14:19:20 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia Why do you see the splinter in your brothers eye but do not notice the log in your own eye?  You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly enough to take the splinter out of your brothers eye. (7:3, 5)
940223906270629888 2017-12-11 14:17:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia Yes.  I know the truth.  I know your head is buried in the sand and living in denial of the facts.
940223699931844608 2017-12-11 14:16:13 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia The biggest mistake Conservatives make about the Bible is assuming that Liberals don't read it.  We do.  We know exactly what it says and when others try to use it for their convenience.
940223461364035584 2017-12-11 14:15:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia That man believed he was working for Christ.  He was a believer.  Don't stick your head in the sand and live in denial.
940222899880972289 2017-12-11 14:13:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia Jesus also preached the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12).  Would you vote for a man who would do harm unto you as a woman?
940222600118263809 2017-12-11 14:11:51 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia Christians have shot up clinics in Colorado.
940061144982499329 2017-12-10 03:30:17 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia I know that's disgusting to read. But the truth hurts sometimes.
940060656434167808 2017-12-10 03:28:20 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia "Fake tits" "moved on her like a bitch".  Yeah, that's the Evangelical Republicans President. Reallllll Christ like.....
940059920354832385 2017-12-10 03:25:25 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia It's OK for a "Christian" to support a man who brags about grabbing pussy and calling for the death penalty for innocent kids as long as he appoints pro-life judges. That's not a Christian to me.
940046985624559617 2017-12-10 02:34:01 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia Nope. Most Muslims call out bad apples. If you were a real Christian you would call out Roy Moore's and Donald Trump's behavior.  I'll wait.
940023219947524101 2017-12-10 00:59:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @RamsNFL @ToddFuhrman It was a 2pt line. It went from a push to a Philly cover.
939996537928724482 2017-12-10 23:13:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> @harmonynjoy Yeah.  I don't believe you.
939996416830828544 2017-12-10 23:13:04 UTC <CrustyBeard> @harmonynjoy Seriously.  You're bringing up that? Dumbest, most illogical straw man argument ever.
939996257837203456 2017-12-10 23:12:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> @harmonynjoy It's 40 years later.  What trial?  Women like you are the reason why victims are afraid to come forward at the time.  They know other women like you will never have their backs against powerful men.  Look how long it took women to confront Weinstein.
939995902156181504 2017-12-10 23:11:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> @harmonynjoy In your mind, Dems are baby killers, so you'll never vote Dem no matter how despicable the R candidate is. So, go away.
939995668252327936 2017-12-10 23:10:06 UTC <CrustyBeard> @harmonynjoy Single issue voters are the worst.  The absolute worst.  I don't care what the single issue is--abortion, climate change.  It doesn't matter.  It clouds their total decision making.
939995126906146817 2017-12-10 23:07:57 UTC <CrustyBeard> @harmonynjoy There's more than reason in this world to vote for a candidate besides abortion.  But, as long as that's the only thing you care about, it would be better for this country if you tore up your voter registration card.
939994865261215744 2017-12-10 23:06:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @harmonynjoy That's my biggest problem with you.  You're a Single Issue Voter (abortion.)  It means you couldn't give a flip about the character of a candidate, as long as they claim to be pro-life, you'll vote for them over any Dem. Pathetic.
939984141881311233 2017-12-10 22:24:18 UTC <CrustyBeard> @harmonynjoy Do you really believe all those women are lying?  I don't.
939960957874376704 2017-12-10 20:52:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> @IsoldeVinitalia Only in name. Not in actions.
939960693423575042 2017-12-10 20:51:07 UTC <CrustyBeard> @harmonynjoy So, you'll support a pedophile just because he claims to be pro-life?  How is that protecting children when you support someone who'll sexually assault them?
939937306374483970 2017-12-10 19:18:11 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NYPost_Brazille Yeah, but you can't get burnt by Dez Bryant like that before halftime.
939929940878856194 2017-12-10 18:48:55 UTC <CrustyBeard> @gogamecocks I know what I want: an OC whose playcalling isn't as predictable as what time the sun rises, isn't afraid to call a trick play, and keeps the ball moving.
939875361692831745 2017-12-10 15:12:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> And Republicans believe in recruiting the Evangelical Republican vote in order to make them single issue voters.  The world is about more than abortion.
939874921135656960 2017-12-10 15:10:17 UTC <CrustyBeard> @nlightened14new It's about calling out hypocrites.  If the shoe fits, wear it.
939873639046045696 2017-12-10 15:05:12 UTC <CrustyBeard> Any Evangelical Republican who believes it's better to sell your soul to elect a pedophile to the Senate over a former Federal Prosecutor who sent killers away is not a true Christian.  It's plain and simple.
939862211497021440 2017-12-10 14:19:47 UTC <CrustyBeard> I'm glad the world is waking up to realize that An Evangelical Republican is not a real Christian.

938468786981736450 2017-12-06 18:02:49 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DineshDSouza @wickwife Hey, Karen.  What proof of guilt do you want for Moore?  The WaPo did extensive reporting, verified facts.  People have provided evidence.  First Moore said he didn't do it.  Now he claims he never knew them.  Isn't it nice how he changes his story????
938468122792792064 2017-12-06 18:00:11 UTC <CrustyBeard> Let me be clear.  I'm not saying it like it's a bad thing.  Dems are showing that they are now capable of keeping their house clean.  Forget the past with Bill Clinton, etc.  This is about right here and right now.  Rs will not show the same fortitude within their own party.
938467321290674178 2017-12-06 17:56:59 UTC <CrustyBeard> I'm going to say exactly what this call for Al Franken to resign is.  It's Democrats setting the moral high ground for if Roy Moore wins.  Republicans can't defend Moore w/o using Franken as a scapegoat.  Dems are taking that away from them.

938426568065605635 2017-12-06 15:15:03 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BenSasse @Bill_I_Cloud @SoberNomad @ladyberzerker @McquillenAj It's not all abortion.  Contraception prevents unwanted pregnancies.  Birth Control pills are also needed for health reasons for many women.  If the GOP cared, they would acknowledge those well known facts.
938426251181744129 2017-12-06 15:13:48 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BenSasse Trump endorsed him.  That's what changed. The GOP is the party of Trump.  And as long as you're a Republican, you're in his party.

938127474659127296 2017-12-05 19:26:34 UTC <CrustyBeard> Russia is banned from the Winter Olympics for doping.  At least the IOC takes their cheating and influence more seriously than Donald Trump's Republican Party does.
938118878068203522 2017-12-05 18:52:24 UTC <CrustyBeard> I sure am glad the IOC takes the seriousness of Russian cheating/rule breaking in international affairs more seriously than the @GOP does.

937725532434849792 2017-12-04 16:49:23 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ElijahEOkon @thecrazycannuck Do you care to elaborate as to what you say she was guilty of?  Because your Tweet is completely vague on that front.
937725321180254208 2017-12-04 16:48:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ElijahEOkon @thecrazycannuck Secondly, we need to hold any elected officials or potential ones to higher standards.  Pedophilia is serious and heinous.  You cannot in good conscious vote for someone just because of an agenda.

937705498048192512 2017-12-04 15:29:47 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ElijahEOkon So, pedophilia is OK as long as he supports Trump's agenda????  Look in the mirror and truly ask yourself if that's the standard you believe in.  Or that God believes in.
937704854625144832 2017-12-04 15:27:13 UTC <CrustyBeard> @zoochum How about we believe them because there's no reason for the women to lie, the Post corroborated their stories and they caught a poser from Veritas who tried to lie? Thought of that?

928619862041251842 2017-11-09 13:46:42 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ameripundit They gained 15 seats in the House with a chance (slight) to flip it to Dem control after recounts. Oh, and while you weren't looking, Dems gained enough seats in the Georgia Senate to end the GOP super majority and be able to filibuster bills there.
928471544472498176 2017-11-08 03:57:21 UTC <CrustyBeard> @JeffSchultzAJC When you have the best roster in the NBA by far, you're allowed to have zero fucks to give.
928470254145204224 2017-11-08 03:52:13 UTC <CrustyBeard> If you're a Conservative Christian who's more upset that a transgender woman won a state house seat than you are about 26 people being shot & killed in cold blood at a church, your priorities are jacked up.
928465017263067136 2017-11-08 03:31:24 UTC <CrustyBeard> @andrewtwalk 26 people including many kids were murdered while worshipping in a church, and this is what you're worried about? Get you priorities in order.

928362848950063105 2017-11-08 20:45:25 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump That election was a year ago, and half the people in that picture are about to be indicted.

928309252044873729 2017-11-08 17:12:27 UTC <CrustyBeard> @thatgirlondeck The current set just turned three.
928299724838522881 2017-11-08 16:34:36 UTC <CrustyBeard> @grey_ghost47 And while you weren't looking last night, Dems picked up five out of seven Republican held seats in the state legislature......in GEORGIA.
928298513653551105 2017-11-08 16:29:47 UTC <CrustyBeard> @grey_ghost47 Actually bigger margins.  And R's got their butts handed to them in the House of Delegates in VA.  Wake up and smell the coffee.

928291304047509506 2017-11-08 16:01:08 UTC <CrustyBeard> Dems kicked ass all up and down the ballot yesterday, so it's time for another "Trump voters still love Trump" story to smooth over their scorched souls. They Still Love Him Anyway
928290571826941952 2017-11-08 15:58:13 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Diabloojosazule Well that made no sense whatsoever.  Happy Trans Women Beat a Conservative Homophobe in Virginia Day!!!
928261102491918336 2017-11-08 14:01:07 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WashTimes @SouthPaugh1 Nah. She had a pretty solid plan, ran a solid campaign about local issues and easily defeated an admitted homophobe.  Nothing confusing about that at all.
928260455474323456 2017-11-08 13:58:33 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Diabloojosazule News flash.  Some of us didn't riot or burn a thing.  We just got extremely motivated to run and campaign for every office we could.  That's what you saw last night.  Learn to live with it.

928108105644363777 2017-11-07 03:53:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> I listened to the interview with Danica Roem on MSNBC.  She showed how you win a race with class and character.  Dems and Republicans alike can both learn from her. Love and a clear message (infrastructure) won over hatred and bigotry.
928104794400620544 2017-11-07 03:40:00 UTC <CrustyBeard> Dear Journalists: It's time for more "Trump voters still like Trump voters" stories, right......actually no.  Spare us.

928080271391494144 2017-11-07 02:02:34 UTC <CrustyBeard> @jbouie Huge.  When Dems run for any race, they encourage their friends and family who might not vote to get out and vote. That affects the entire ballot.
928076642311921664 2017-11-07 01:48:09 UTC <CrustyBeard> @MSignorile Trump will roll a losing Republican under the bus faster than he can roll his fat ass up to the buffet.

927699768817659904 2017-11-06 00:50:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 Yes you're dogging it. It's a yes or no question. You've not given a yes or no answer.
927666031375601666 2017-11-06 22:36:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 No. It was failures and loopholes in the FBI background checks.Shouldn't we close those loops? Same loops allowed Dylan Roof to buy his gun.
927665661589049344 2017-11-06 22:35:03 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 You gun nuts always say we need to just follow the laws on the books, but when pressed on it, you act stupid about the facts.
927665394629955584 2017-11-06 22:33:59 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 So be a man and answer my question. Should he have been allowed to buy the weapons legally?
927665212982996998 2017-11-06 22:33:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 Fact: he was sent to military prison after being convicted of domestic assault. Fact: he bought the rifle at an Academy Sports.
927660101376380929 2017-11-06 22:12:57 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 He bought the rifle at a store legally.
927659945385918475 2017-11-06 22:12:20 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 Yes or no. Should the killer have been legally allowed to buy the guns he used knowing he had domestic violence convictions?
927656315631161344 2017-11-06 21:57:55 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 Your manipulated comment was equally stupid. Neither of us was there. You have no idea what reaction time you would have had.

927635811201318912 2017-11-06 20:36:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 If we're in an area where a shooting is happening, and you're a stranger, how the fuck do I know how responsible you are?A cop is uniformed.
927635449195229184 2017-11-06 20:35:00 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 Great.  Then there's no reason for a bump stock, amirite?
927634961749946369 2017-11-06 20:33:04 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 One word:  Hawaii.  They did it.  It works there.  Because unlike Chicago, you can't drive guns across the Indiana state line to Honolulu.
927634697169068032 2017-11-06 20:32:01 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 So, they could accidentally hit other innocent bystanders?????
927634531028553730 2017-11-06 20:31:21 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @AnthonyMintz1 @PlumberVic And I don't understand why any "law abiding" gun owner should be opposed to a complete ban on bump stocks.  No excuse for having that.
927634261359853568 2017-11-06 20:30:17 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 Also read this about the Colorado WalMart shooting last week. Too many people pulling out guns hindered the police.http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/02/shoppers-pulled-weapons-walmart-shooting/
927633818437214208 2017-11-06 20:28:31 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 The point is no "good guy with a gun" was ever going to stop him.
927631908757962759 2017-11-06 20:20:56 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 A man fired out of a LV hotel room across the street and hit almost 600 people. What side arm was going to stop that?
927631491399651328 2017-11-06 20:19:16 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA @SpeakerRyan @PlumberVic @AnthonyMintz1 Explain how law abiding gun owners prevented 26 deaths. Oh, you can't. Your argument is invalid.
927631029116030977 2017-11-06 20:17:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> @SpeakerRyan Your lack of action will cause it to continue staying at half mast all the time.
927565048310099968 2017-11-06 15:55:15 UTC <CrustyBeard> @EddieTrunk Did Motley Crue actually sign contracts saying they wouldn't play anymore after theirs?

925779956113793024 2017-11-01 17:41:56 UTC <CrustyBeard> Hey, Papa Johns, I quit ordering your nasty pizza after your public stance on the ACA, not on the NFL. Learn something.
925778497955618817 2017-11-01 17:36:08 UTC <CrustyBeard> @awfulannouncing It's also their shitty pizza and his RW political stances.
925736192393523201 2017-11-01 14:48:02 UTC <CrustyBeard> @LindseyGrahamSC Can we do the same thing for the Las Vegas shooter?  Asking for 600 friends.
925733205080182784 2017-11-01 14:36:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> Everyone start calling him Donny Denial until it totally kicks in.
925733123173654528 2017-11-01 14:35:50 UTC <CrustyBeard> Since the WH likes to act as if the Mueller investigation will lead to nothing and Trump likes nicknames, we need to call him Donny Denial.
925730544935227392 2017-11-01 14:25:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump Nearly 600 people were shot in Las Vegas.  What is your plan to stop that, Donny Denial?
925503294382006272 2017-10-31 23:22:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> Oh, sure. When I offer candy to little kids any other night, I'm some kind of creep....
925499816435748864 2017-10-31 23:08:45 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DonaldJTrumpJr Or you can give it all to the richest 1% of kids and tell her it will trickle down to her eventually.

925373185813557248 2017-10-31 14:45:34 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump So, one guilty plea and two indictments is a hoax, but Tony Podesta is real???? OK, Denial Don.
925089540435533825 2017-10-30 19:58:28 UTC <CrustyBeard> @GregMcElroy @mspears96 @SECNetwork Bret Bielema--because he already ate the candy before the trick-or-treaters showed up.
925079440681521153 2017-10-30 19:18:20 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BySteveReilly That doesn't necessarily mean they're related to the Mueller investigation.  They could involved other cases.
925067673834344450 2017-10-30 18:31:35 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Cernovich We Libs are fine with it.  Unlike you, we put country before party.  So, if he's guilty, send him to jail just like Trump's cronies. Get it?
925043434620182528 2017-10-30 16:55:15 UTC <CrustyBeard> @AspenInstSports I thought UNC already did that.
925030523671597056 2017-10-30 16:03:57 UTC <CrustyBeard> @deanofcomedy Personally, I think Papadopoulos is the one doing all the singing right now.
925011423255846914 2017-10-30 14:48:03 UTC <CrustyBeard> Am I the only one who now thinks the Papadopoulos plea is a bigger deal than Manfort? Does it mean he's already chirping?
925008148804534272 2017-10-30 14:35:03 UTC <CrustyBeard> @KeepItRealist I just embarrassed @keepitrealist and destroyed his entire talking points on Twitter, so he blocked me.  Everyone tell him I said hello.
925004329781743617 2017-10-30 14:19:52 UTC <CrustyBeard> @KeepItRealist Cons, OTOH, will do anything to protect Dear Leader Trump--even if it means putting the country's best interest in the back of your minds.
925003763492016128 2017-10-30 14:17:37 UTC <CrustyBeard> @KeepItRealist Here's what you Cons need to understand.  If Hillary and Podesta go to jail, we Libs are OK with it.  We're Country over Party.  You're not.

923543362141028352 2017-10-26 13:34:30 UTC <CrustyBeard> @nytimes @arisetyo @ERodCommentary So, a 10-yr-old girl with cerebral palsy deserves to be held in a detention center away from her family because of her parents' sins???
923542129422585856 2017-10-26 13:29:36 UTC <CrustyBeard> @CarmenYulinCruz @WhitefishEnergy Welcome to 2017, where spats over natural disaster recovery take place on Twitter. Everyone needs to grow up and act like adults.
923277238405091328 2017-10-25 19:57:01 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Reflog_18 Just send him to the West End.  He won't be able to walk half-a-block without tripping into one.

921847808524800000 2017-10-21 21:16:59 UTC <CrustyBeard> Alabama is up 21-0 at HT, and Nick Saban is still going to give his team an ass-chewing.
921842001821290496 2017-10-21 20:53:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @DLoesch @NRATV This looks more like an ISIS recruiting video than a lobby for #2A rights. What has the NRA become?

921460628224606213 2017-10-20 19:38:28 UTC <CrustyBeard> @KevinMKruse I'm the captain of a four-time team trivia champion. If you want to go over me, that's highly inappropriate.
921354287971815424 2017-10-20 12:35:54 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke Are you upset that a cowboy hat looks better on her than it does on you?
921193019151388673 2017-10-19 01:55:05 UTC <CrustyBeard> @ariscott I've been with my company for 19 years.  We now have employees born after I was hired.  Good night.
921083377717010432 2017-10-19 18:39:24 UTC <CrustyBeard> Nope.  He said he hates bigotry.  Those are exclusive.
921070960970731521 2017-10-19 17:50:04 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Starwars779 Your family will be proud.
921069478263316481 2017-10-19 17:44:10 UTC <CrustyBeard> @TaraMcCarthy444 Then move somewhere else where you can be alone.  In America, you're part of a rich and diverse population you have to live with.
921067088592154624 2017-10-19 17:34:41 UTC <CrustyBeard> @MattBinder I don't get what you mean.  You left us hanging, Chad.
921066798837100545 2017-10-19 17:33:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> He can speak all he wants.  I'm just saying that no one is required to listen to him. I hope he speaks to an empty room.
921061994479935488 2017-10-19 17:14:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> Here's the thing to remember about #SpencerAtUF: There's nothing in the First Amendment that requires anyone to listen to him.
921060741133864962 2017-10-19 17:09:27 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realJamesAllsup It's hard to understand spending a half-million dollars to defend a man who thinks other people are worthless human beings.
921059739429163009 2017-10-19 17:05:28 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realJamesAllsup They're more upset that much money is being spent to protect a man who isn't worth a plug nickel.
921058697610256385 2017-10-19 17:01:20 UTC <CrustyBeard> @colecubelic Ironhead.  Craig Heyward was a beast.
921053924454469634 2017-10-19 16:42:22 UTC <CrustyBeard> @KevinMKruse As a South Carolina alum, nothing was sweeter than beating them in Greenville knowing that HB2 was the reason the game was moved there.

920839527157166080 2017-10-18 02:30:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Mark_Schlabach There's a guy at this bar at the Greenville SC Hilton doing an amazing Harry Carey impression while watching this game.
920830933586141185 2017-10-18 01:56:17 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BillOReilly You're sitting on your thumbs because you're a misogynist.
920749609512816640 2017-10-18 20:33:08 UTC <CrustyBeard> @WalshFreedom @deanofcomedy I would, but I blocked and muted him a long time ago.  See, unlike him, I didn't boycott paying my child support.
920747328646123520 2017-10-18 20:24:04 UTC <CrustyBeard> @jdawsey1 Four months after it was promised and five minutes after the media reports it, but they're the disgusting ones....OK.
920723604421083136 2017-10-18 18:49:48 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Mike_P_Williams @JoeVargas @Konatimn Like Trump would ever let some guy in a blue polo shirt stand between him and the camera.
920723395020513280 2017-10-18 18:48:58 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Mike_P_Williams @JoeVargas @Konatimn That pic looks really photoshopped.
920720285900443649 2017-10-18 18:36:36 UTC <CrustyBeard> @FLOTUS @connie9030 Those Michelle pictures are clearly photoshopped.

920688293133606912 2017-10-18 16:29:29 UTC <CrustyBeard> @BillOReilly No it doesn't. It's highly conceivable that Trump is an empathetic man.

920670439743066115 2017-10-18 15:18:32 UTC <CrustyBeard> Hey, @GOP. It's been over two weeks since Las Vegas. Can we talk gun control now?  The "too soon" part has passed, and we haven't forgotten.
920670230581579776 2017-10-18 15:17:42 UTC <CrustyBeard> @NRA Hey, @nra. It's been over two weeks since Las Vegas. Can we talk gun control now?  The "too soon" part has passed, and we haven't forgotten.
920668896742531072 2017-10-18 15:12:24 UTC <CrustyBeard> Megyn Kelly's ratings are really bad on NBC. I can't believe someone who spent years on a polarizing network can't appeal to the masses.
920660360989995009 2017-10-18 14:38:29 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Mastercard It's 2017. Why do I have to send a letter by snail mail to make sure a vendor does not bill my card? You take my payment online.
920638550609076224 2017-10-18 13:11:49 UTC <CrustyBeard> @foxandfriends @TomiLahren @FoxNews Their ratings are up and no advertisers have left them, but don't let those facts ruin your perfectly stupid argument.

920631189463031808 2017-10-18 12:42:34 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump Stop crying wolf.  Grow up and act like a President for once.

920471226329587712 2017-10-17 02:06:56 UTC <CrustyBeard> @notthefakeSVP @celebrityhottub It's just a "hotter take" for people to be assholes.  They think it gets them more positive exposure--especially on social media.

919967386215813122 2017-10-16 16:44:51 UTC <CrustyBeard> @wesrucker247 Butch: I'm filing a complaint with the SEC because South Carolina's defense didn't just lay down and let us score touchdowns.
919966101852835840 2017-10-16 16:39:45 UTC <CrustyBeard> @wesrucker247 Butch: We did everything to prevent rain from coming in the house except build a roof over it.

919944956600553477 2017-10-16 15:15:44 UTC <CrustyBeard> @kayleighmcenany Holy Shit.  She might not be elected President in 2016.  Meanwhile, I hope the pussy grabber doesn't get elected.
919942427011674112 2017-10-16 15:05:40 UTC <CrustyBeard> @Andy_Staples Johnny Majors and Philip Fulmer were fired after losing to South Carolina.  How is Butch Jones still employed?
919924621964701696 2017-10-16 13:54:55 UTC <CrustyBeard> @realDonaldTrump That's still more than you're good at.

917495745971974144 2017-10-09 21:03:26 UTC <CrustyBeard> I'm thinking the Sox are done for the year.  Just a guess......
