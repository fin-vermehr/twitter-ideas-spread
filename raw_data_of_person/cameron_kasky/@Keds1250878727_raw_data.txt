969270398704635905 2018-03-01 17:57:25 UTC <Keds1250878727> @dbongino @TiredofLies6 @elianapvaz The left is hating the damage done to our country by trump and GOP. Big difference. And your tweet is as polarizing as anything else. Always blame the Dems. Repubs take responsibility for NOTHING. EVER.

969265855409385473 2018-03-01 17:39:22 UTC <Keds1250878727> @SaysHummingbird @Toast2Karin Correction. The Koch brothers own every republican. Full stop.

But that doesnt suit your argument so you ignore it. The one you are referring to is actually 30yrs old and a felon. The other one is a student in high school. Sad you dont know the facts. But when Breitbart is your source...

969252803599269889 2018-03-01 16:47:30 UTC <Keds1250878727> @NaylorFran Well i just voted yesterday and was required to show a photo ID.

You cant even defend him without resorting to Obama and Hillary. What would you do without them to blame for every screw-up baby Don pulls off?

As for working with the other side, repubs havent done that since Kennedy. They have been so busy blocking everything they have forgotten how to govern (as shown by the current admin).

Something like the poor need to stop spending their money on movies, alcohol and women. I just know what that old fart has on his mind.

We need to take his fat paycheck and his bank account and move him into section 8 housing. Next he can find a job like every other working stiff and see how well he lives on that.

Im in the low income group these days being retired. He took away the few tax deductions i had.
969117670871326720 2018-02-28 07:50:32 UTC <Keds1250878727> @Cityofwise If you include the Kochtopus as part of the shadow govt then i might agree. But not all Dems and not all Repubs are part of it. There are still an ethical few laying around.

969113446724890624 2018-02-28 07:33:45 UTC <Keds1250878727> @woodpecker002 You do know there are two different guys with that name right? One is a drug dealer age around 30, the other is a high school student who just survived a mass shooting at his school. It never is a waste of time to educate yourself. .

969108712118980608 2018-02-28 07:14:56 UTC <Keds1250878727> @iporem @MatthewNussbaum Trump obviously still has a thing for Obama. He really needs to get over it. This isnt a fing contest.

I wondered why he was the only one that made more requests for sensitive reports than anyone. First thing i thought of was Sale! Info for sale!.

He fought against nazism, hatred, bigotry and more so todays Dems & Repubs can go for each others throats. What we got was a fake in WH hell bent on tearing our country apart, gutting our govt, alienating allies,
969010197149741056 2018-02-28 00:43:28 UTC <Keds1250878727> @Conservazona @howienudet So your suggestion is for white women to start pumping out white babies?

Their tax reform is going to cost us plenty in just a couple of years.  We will be paying for it, Dem and Repub, in higher taxes while they pocket their loot.
969005216707350528 2018-02-28 00:23:41 UTC <Keds1250878727> @hammetjohn So? A mass murderer would not kill so many if he had to catch them before he knifed them. On the other hand his AR15 will mow down many in seconds.
969004372767182848 2018-02-28 00:20:20 UTC <Keds1250878727> @RepMattGaetz @gayerobin18 @DonaldJTrumpJr @hammetjohn Yeah that will work. Make it all public so the ones being investigated and their handlers know every step of the investigation to give them time to cover their crimes. F**k that.
969000900164489216 2018-02-28 00:06:32 UTC <Keds1250878727> @old_osc Amen to that!

968998658762072065 2018-02-28 23:57:38 UTC <Keds1250878727> @dbongino @uspatrol Yeah, even Nixon didnt have as many scandals as trump. But trump always likes being the one with the most of practically anything. Cant wait until hes gone.

967700472470663168 2018-02-25 09:59:06 UTC <Keds1250878727> @1_lancaster No. Its been the basis for a free democracy for over 200 years. Its a living document. In the current political climate any new constitution would be so partisan it would be useless. No one would be thinking of America. Only what they could get out of it.

967694037963722752 2018-02-25 09:33:32 UTC <Keds1250878727> @politico @SuppressThis And with absolutely no input from Dems. Of course its f**cked up. You do a sloppy job in the dark you get a sloppy result. Now they want the Dems to help them fix it.

Gun free zones are not going to save anyone from someone determined enough to kill. You cant put guards everywhere.

967034808999317504 2018-02-23 13:53:59 UTC <Keds1250878727> @trusokoff @AndrewA62959597 No intelligence involved in that idea. Just like his govt shutdown. What a jackass.
967034478349705216 2018-02-23 13:52:40 UTC <Keds1250878727> @trusokoff @JacobAWohl Well its not that unusual in Chicago is it? Do you expect media to report every shooting across the US everyday. Wouldnt have much time for anything else.
967033626541133824 2018-02-23 13:49:17 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ScottAnthonyUSA @janehoffmanrn_e Its a training drill.
967033096502759424 2018-02-23 13:47:11 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ScottAnthonyUSA @justice69hall Oh for gods sake. Its a training exercise. There is nothing odd about it. They happen every year. 
967032230139912194 2018-02-23 13:43:44 UTC <Keds1250878727> @trusokoff @ScottAnthonyUSA I dont think you know what this drill is about. Its actually a training drill for medical, hospital, police, and fire department personnel to give them experience in handling major catastophic events. Nothing nefarious about it. They happen all the time.
967030019951419394 2018-02-23 13:34:57 UTC <Keds1250878727> @eavesdropann @SheriffClarke @trusokoff @MazurekRob Hum. 17 dead people at a school is a hoax pulled off by Obama supporters. Really. If your bio is true, i sure am glad you live in Canada because there is something really wrong with your thinking.
967028802772783106 2018-02-23 13:30:07 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CPAC @DLoesch @trusokoff @MatthewManUSA No problem with sensible, law-abiding people having guns. Just dont understand why they have to be military style automatic rapid fire guns. And why they have to be so easy to get.
967028016844066816 2018-02-23 13:27:00 UTC <Keds1250878727> @trusokoff Yeah, because being poor is so much more fun. Since when did poor become synonymous with lazy? This GOP is really out of step with the real world.
967027397844520961 2018-02-23 13:24:32 UTC <Keds1250878727> @trusokoff @jaketapper Every time someone mentions the killer using only his last name, i think immediately of Ted Cruz, senator from Texas. And i wonder what hes up to now.

What is wrong with banning assault rifles? It isnt depriving anyone of their right to own guns. Every right comes with some restrictions and obligations.
967020641961594880 2018-02-23 12:57:42 UTC <Keds1250878727> @SafetyPinDaily Trump didnt recognize the Patriots when they were in the room with him. His paymaster said   jump and trumpie asked how high?.

He wanted to make a bipartisan report to the American people but McConnell said no. Maybe he should have gone ahead but can you imagine the response? GOP/trumpsters would have a fit.

Most guns used in crime are stolen. Maybe there should be a level of screening dependent on the type of gun. And training required.

Its ok if Reps do it but not ok if a court has to step in to make it a fair fight? Typical rep.
966821068597063681 2018-02-22 23:44:40 UTC <Keds1250878727> @chuckwoolery @Shortguy1 So a more equal redistricting will add a possible 2-3 dems to congress? In a state that predominately votes Dem yet only gets Rep seats due to heavy gerrymandering? Tough .

966801513359249409 2018-02-22 22:26:57 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ddale8 @TOurbangirl There was a murder by a teen some time ago. He was stunned seeing the man just dropped, just folded down. Didnt fall or fly back like in the movies. He didnt think it would happen like it did. He was still shaken when the police found him soon after.
966800234700509185 2018-02-22 22:21:52 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ddale8 @TOurbangirl I disagree. I remember the first time i saw a PICTURE of a dead body in a newspaper. I felt like i got kicked in the gut. I was 10Yrs old. Now that im in my 60s it doesnt faze me so much. Could be i just grew older. Could be all those movies i used to see.

964349400804978688 2018-02-15 04:03:08 UTC <Keds1250878727> @NewYorker @w_weinstein And the parents and friends of those victims? They should not be subjected to that. People have gotten sensitized from TV shows and movies that use acts like this for entertainment.
964345716276637696 2018-02-15 03:48:30 UTC <Keds1250878727> @washingtonpost @RaisedRR You are kidding right?
964345087286226945 2018-02-15 03:46:00 UTC <Keds1250878727> @washingtonpost @RaisedRR That justifies absolutely....NOTHING!
964344457461149696 2018-02-15 03:43:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> @washingtonpost @RaisedRR Even better if nobody had that gun. It isnt a target shooting gun. It isnt a hunting gun, unless you are hunting people. That is its sole purpose. There is no reason that needs to be in the hands of anyone except military or police.
964343469081808896 2018-02-15 03:39:34 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @DukeCityKnight I get it already!!! I still think it would be better if it said <crickets> or even (silence).
964341015967666176 2018-02-15 03:29:49 UTC <Keds1250878727> @BillClinton @56brownpelican Actually he spoke quite about about it when he was being investigated and impeached. Maybe you didnt catch it on numerous TV stations or. Newspapers or news magazines. It was all over the place.
964340428312018944 2018-02-15 03:27:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> @BillClinton @56brownpelican Just curious....what is your opinion of trumps extra curricular activities in that particular subject?
964283289849794560 2018-02-15 23:40:26 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @DukeCityKnight Trump is the worst ever at responding appropriately but i have never heard him say thoughts and prayer for the shooter.
964282877377687555 2018-02-15 23:38:48 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @KrispyTacoBelle The top refers to punishments. But the last one says thoughts and prayers. That isnt a punishment. It should have read prison. Or is it your position that white people who murder dont go to jail? I think you missed reading comprehension.
964281817904840704 2018-02-15 23:34:35 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @Melissajudeutah I know.
964250263535136770 2018-02-15 21:29:12 UTC <Keds1250878727> @washingtonpost @Baflo And a gun.
964249966721097730 2018-02-15 21:28:01 UTC <Keds1250878727> @washingtonpost @RaisedRR In none of the school shootings has a vehicle been used.  Buildings tend to stop a vehicle cold. Banning vehicles is not going to happen for obvious reasons.  2A applies to local militias. That would be military, National Guard, Coast Guard, police.
964246132804243456 2018-02-15 21:12:47 UTC <Keds1250878727> @RWPUSA @ToddLytle They dont need money to pass a law. All they need is pen and paper and a working brain.
964245682331713543 2018-02-15 21:11:00 UTC <Keds1250878727> @RWPUSA @JCDWorld Yeah, he was. But how many guns were available then?
964245487871250434 2018-02-15 21:10:13 UTC <Keds1250878727> @RWPUSA True. But when they discovered their error they started immediately to prevent it from happening again. And being the military there were probably some repercussions for the people who dropped the ball.
964241338727362563 2018-02-15 20:53:44 UTC <Keds1250878727> @TomiLahren Problem with that logic is you cant separate the two. If one or the other had not been there this crime would not have happened.
964240624923922432 2018-02-15 20:50:54 UTC <Keds1250878727> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @deedeesSay Good point. I concur. 
964236561062744068 2018-02-15 20:34:45 UTC <Keds1250878727> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @deedeesSay You can take off the unsightly and unattractive. (I dont disagree). They arent a requirement for a decent human being. All the others 
964235313135616000 2018-02-15 20:29:47 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump You missed it. Thoughts and prayers are for the victims. Jail is for perpetrators. All of them.

964030649400209409 2018-02-14 06:56:32 UTC <Keds1250878727> @TomiLahren Actually its about a lunatic with a gun.

963912023103942656 2018-02-14 23:05:09 UTC <Keds1250878727> Pruitt, you just arent that important. Or maybe you have really pissed off some dangerous people?   EPA chief says he flies first class due to security concerns (from @AP)https://apnews.com/55f6e87574fe4c46a2a667b7e560ea75
963903800212901888 2018-02-14 22:32:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> Thanks, trump for nothing. Everything you do turns to .https://twitter.com/andrewsweiss/status/963430793262653440

The attacks by foreign govts on our press at some meetings he did not defend them. He sat quiet. What kind of American diplomat allows that without comment? None that we have had...until now. Want to defend the others? Waiting....

The Kochtopus network wanted people who would destruct the agencies they were appointed to. Look at who has been appointed & where. What have they done? Its so obvious. Bannons goal & Koch $$$.

Who did he appoint to different agencies & why that particular person? Pruitt for EPA? Devos for education? Tillerson for SoS? Perry in energy? Kobuch for gods sake on election fraud.

Just like the one trump is going to leave for the next prez. Wait and see.

Steele was concerned about what he found, passed it on to FBI. FBI confirmed same info recd from their own sources. Before Steeles dossier. Steeles dossier was raw info. You know what that is?
963674722033684480 2018-02-13 07:22:12 UTC <Keds1250878727> @funder @TinyFingerTrump @oldJavaGuy @VickiEvansChas1 @IvanDeploravich Oh thats a good one. Hillary got almost no coverage from the press and trump got most of it. You know how the dossier came into being? The RNC did oppo on trump prior to his nomination. After that they dropped it. DNC hired a co to continue.

963671019516059648 2018-02-13 07:07:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> @funder @TinyFingerTrump @oldJavaGuy @IvanDeploravich Yeah? So why the biggest tax breaks for the wealthiest & big corporations? When they have the highest pofit s & lowest unemployment, why the big tax cuts.? That was stupid. We should be deploying those taxes on infrastructure, Social programs, reducing debt.

There are some crazy liberals who are just as rabid and stubborn as the trumpsters. But the majority, including me, know there are enlightened people on both sides, who can understand when they hear the truth, and see through the lies.

Hopefully that will happen in 2020. Antifa are just a band of thugs who claim a political political party but really dont care about any politics.
963652538494005250 2018-02-13 05:54:03 UTC <Keds1250878727> @SaysHummingbird @nopittie They would bricks to get Dem out of govt if they did half of what the trump admin is doing.
963647617233235968 2018-02-13 05:34:30 UTC <Keds1250878727> @DonOfDonsInLA Wouldnt that be illegal under the client-privilege? And you know trump just had to have made him sign NDA.
963646397982625792 2018-02-13 05:29:39 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FoxNews @RiskyLiberal Got to keep that money flowing to his buddies. A big FU to the rest of us who cherish those spaces in their natural state.

Clinton Foundation was investigated and was found to be acting in accordance with the laws that apply to those organizations. Pay for play claims found to have no credibility. They were cleared of that too.

You remember that comment about wanting to know the truth? And having an open mind. Did you understand what i meant? Im not sure you did.

Hence trump and current GOP. It takes an open mind and a desire for truth. That does not describe trumps base.

I know about the time period & i also know what happens when pressure is put on an investigative agency to reach a quick conclusion for political reasons, by govt or local police depts. I also know about tunnel vision in an investigation.

963516410659033089 2018-02-13 20:53:08 UTC <Keds1250878727> @IvanDeploravich FBI exonerated him completely. The public & media who pushed the false claims of his guilt.

961421937082814464 2018-02-07 02:10:26 UTC <Keds1250878727> @Sea_2Lake @RepAdamSchiff @timeout2575 @dakota295752 FISA warrants are issued in secret, yes. Because they derive from investigations on foreigners who are suspected of wrong doing in our country. If it involves an American the FISA is required to let that name be unmasked & surveilled. No secret trial.

And he wont inform ICE to deport illegals with felonies or gang affiliations. They are picking up people who have been a benefit to our country. Hardworking, family driven people.

958903605263785984 2018-01-31 03:23:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> @PresWallace There was a code they put on tenant applications that denoted whether they were African-American. It was a C. Those applicants were weeded out.

958890592783781888 2018-01-31 02:31:47 UTC <Keds1250878727> @PresWallace I disagree. But in any case words dont speak as loudly as actions. Trump is a bigot. Unless you have boatloads of money and/or power, then he wants to be your friend.

958874459317907457 2018-01-31 01:27:40 UTC <Keds1250878727> @polishprincessh Because Trump has done nothing to advance the cause of unity suddenly we are to believe he means it now? Fat chance.

Their money along with donations from Mercers & friends is what runs our GOP. What these people want, they get. Just ask Ryan and McConnell re the rush on tax bill

943027482357268480 2017-12-18 07:57:27 UTC <Keds1250878727> @frankthorp @kimberley_page So nobody will notice, same as the abortion rule. All eyes on taxes but no need to read this other stuff were going to stiff you with. 
943022790369775616 2017-12-18 07:38:48 UTC <Keds1250878727> @SenBobCorker @igorvolsky But hes still going to vote FOR it. They dont even try to hide their theft anymore.

943021758776569857 2017-12-18 07:34:42 UTC <Keds1250878727> @AriFleischer Thats what happens when private conversations are aired to the public without context.
943021345721462784 2017-12-18 07:33:03 UTC <Keds1250878727> @AriFleischer @FoxBusiness If you cant tell the difference between animosity toward trump and animosity toward his actions in our govt you have a more serious problem than liberals have with trump himself. Sad.
943016635270656000 2017-12-18 07:14:20 UTC <Keds1250878727> @saletan Could be because so many conservative stories need fact checking? Yeah that must be it. Ask Fox News, i mean Noise, about that. They are chock full of fake news, lies, innuendo without facts, conspiracies under every bush. 
943014639947976704 2017-12-18 07:06:25 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC Got the wrong message there, bubba. Mueller is looking for the truth., wherever it goes and no matter who it touches, good or bad.
942867330245234689 2017-12-18 21:21:03 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABCPolitics THE GOP DOES NOT CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ANYONE ELSE.
942867075441332224 2017-12-18 21:20:03 UTC <Keds1250878727> @votevets And now the Repubs are denigrating this honorable man for their personal gain. That says everything we need to know about our GOP and trumpian admin in WH.

942847752123371520 2017-12-18 20:03:16 UTC <Keds1250878727> @KrisParonto @MarkGeistSWP @haskinstheodore @FiveRights @m4zdaman It took over 2 years to get the Nixon investigation completed. And there were AUDIO TAPES IN HIS OWN VOICE proving what he did. And dont kid yourself about 45. He is scared less that his money trail will be his downfall and he knows it.
942846704910512128 2017-12-18 19:59:06 UTC <Keds1250878727> @KrisParonto @MarkGeistSWP @haskinstheodore @FiveRights @m4zdaman You are so bent over some Dem-leaning people working on this investigation. Yet the DEMS say NOTHING about bias for all the Republicans IN CHARGE AT EVERY LEVEL investigating a REPUB presidents campaign. Why is that?
942845180234944514 2017-12-18 19:53:02 UTC <Keds1250878727> @KrisParonto @MarkGeistSWP @haskinstheodore @FiveRights @m4zdaman Again you assume no one can be unbiased due to having worked in a Dem admin, donated to Dem candidates, expressed political opinions you disagree with. FISA warrants are approved by a judge. They are heavily scrutinized.
942843277241470977 2017-12-18 19:45:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> @KrisParonto @MarkGeistSWP @haskinstheodore @FiveRights @m4zdaman That article proves nothing. Its innuendo at best. They may have been discussing campaign issues. Why do pro-trump people assume a personal bias against 45? Couldnt it be we simply hate his attacks on American agencies,  his bias for Russia? Divisiveness?
942840376301445120 2017-12-18 19:33:57 UTC <Keds1250878727> @KrisParonto @MarkGeistSWP @haskinstheodore @FiveRights @m4zdaman Good luck finding any investigators anywhere that dont have a political opinion. Doesnt mean they cant be impartial in their work.
942839586895605761 2017-12-18 19:30:49 UTC <Keds1250878727> @KrisParonto @MarkGeistSWP @haskinstheodore @FiveRights @m4zdaman Just because he was anti-Trump doesnt make him biased in his investigation. He didnt like Hillary either. I dont know what kind of work you do, but when you have to make decisions based on opinions or ideas of others do you let your politics weigh in?
942838736840163328 2017-12-18 19:27:26 UTC <Keds1250878727> @KrisParonto @MarkGeistSWP @haskinstheodore @FiveRights @m4zdaman Those Repubs are all invested in stalling or stopping this investigation. Not because of the dossier. Because of $$$ they have taken in from Russian donors. Mueller isnt interested in unproven info from any source. Hes going for the truth. Just the facts.
942837781893648384 2017-12-18 19:23:38 UTC <Keds1250878727> @KrisParonto @MarkGeistSWP @haskinstheodore @FiveRights @m4zdaman The media i listen to, watch, and read is pretty well balanced as far as liberal and  conservative. I dont rule anything out. But I dont drink the kool-aid either.

They were probably the targets of the wiretaps, if there were any. Not Trump. With Trumps love fest for all things Russia he may have been caught up in surveillance on them. Just a thought.
942835839922524160 2017-12-18 19:15:55 UTC <Keds1250878727> @KrisParonto @MarkGeistSWP @haskinstheodore @FiveRights @m4zdaman That is not a very reliable source. It is plainly biased. Have you checked any of the assertions made via any other sources? I would suggest you do so.

Do you get it yet???

Its info clollected from different sources. Unfiltered. Not proven true or false. FBI/CIA have been working on proving whether true or false. Mueller will not use info not proven to be true.

They expected he would toe the Republican line & kill the investigation. But thats not how Meuller works. His focus is on finding the truth wherever it leads. He got a little too close to them. Theyre scared.

942496571484266496 2017-12-17 20:47:48 UTC <Keds1250878727> I also believe we need rules & regs that state legislative actions must have at least 3 public debates, and a delay of at least 30days after the last debate before any legislation can be voted on.
942495882947301376 2017-12-17 20:45:03 UTC <Keds1250878727> I have come to the conclusion that we need reading comprehension tests, background checks, mental health and acuity tests, logical thinking tests, tests for analytical reasoning, ability to forecast effects of actions, & proof of compassion in our candidates.

942327595840032768 2017-12-17 09:36:21 UTC <Keds1250878727> @vicenews The GOP position that the rules stifled infrastructure is so laughable. In fact the opposite was true.

942271876205830144 2017-12-16 05:54:56 UTC <Keds1250878727> @kim I imagine a great horde of people surrounding the WH in TOTAL SILENCE just standing and staring. I think that would be unnerving after a while, & them wondering what is going to happen next.

When govt tells you what to say and what you are allowed to learn freedom is lost. My family and my ancestors back to Revolutioary War did not fight for freedom from tyranny for this takeover.
942265094007934976 2017-12-16 05:27:59 UTC <Keds1250878727> @saletan Whats troublesome is the degree some people will bend over backward to protect a corrupt Russian led traitor at the expense of our country. Prez 45 breaks every rule, regulation, & bends the law to suit his needs. If we continue to allow this we will be RU.

Meanwhile, and for the last 9 years, GOP is destroying our agencies, giving themselves big tax breaks at our expense, eroding or taking away our entitlements, & more. GOP cant govern their way out of a paper bag.
940064504158625792 2017-12-10 03:43:38 UTC <Keds1250878727> @kim @konskicoco Thats just wrong. No defense whatso ever for pedophilia. He just trying to justify his choice to vote for Moore. Make him feel better about himself. Typical Rep. cares more for fetus unborn than living child standing in front of him.
940062957811011584 2017-12-10 03:37:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> @kim And thats the whole problem. All dictatorships reason the ends justify the means. 45ers dont realize what some of those means could be...until its too late.

If you want to measure best month GDP betwen 45 & Obama you should have used Obamas 5.6% GDP. But then that would skew your comparison.

938903855697420291 2017-12-07 22:51:37 UTC <Keds1250878727> @dbongino Doesnt it worry you that so many GOP, even including Trump, have taken campaign money from Russia and apparently are doing Russias bidding by delaying the sanctions recently signed? Why are Reps so scared of an investigation?? Nothing happened, right?

Maybe we should be looking at GOP instead of Trump? Or both. I smell a big pile of coming from DC.

938845889724067841 2017-12-07 19:01:17 UTC <Keds1250878727> @NBCNews Why is there a question concerning whether USA should compete in Olympics?
938691348483444736 2017-12-07 08:47:12 UTC <Keds1250878727> @SafetyPinDaily Trump does not care. Full stop.

My pension is $1700/month after 43 years employed. I cant make it without SS/med
938686512203489280 2017-12-07 08:27:59 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ChrisCuomo @thehill The deficit he helped create by voting for that stupid tax cut bill. Middle income families paying for the richest to get major PERMANENT tax break and then have to pay for the deficit with our taxes we paid for our retirement and Medicare.
938685679898431490 2017-12-07 08:24:40 UTC <Keds1250878727> @krassenstein Then dont. Represent the USA instead.

938608953952559104 2017-12-06 03:19:47 UTC <Keds1250878727> Nobody resigns until TRUMP RESIGNS. Double standard. Then you can start on the Congress and apply the same justice to everyone. Or you can STFU.

In public. On a stage. Un invited. (You could tell by Robins reaction). In Frankens case it was part of the skit though he did push it too far, but not in Robins case
938343668989218816 2017-12-06 09:45:38 UTC <Keds1250878727> @funder Another one who thinks he is above the law because his daddy got him off so many times.

938333075032936448 2017-12-06 09:03:33 UTC <Keds1250878727> @PalmerReport That isnt all he does. He lashes out by hurting America and causing trouble. Cutting Bears Ears National Monument by 85%, cutting Grande Escalante by 50%, and announcing the move of our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

This tax.bill benefits the wealthiest at the expense of the rest of us. And my respose isnt partisan or liberal based. Its not political in anyway. It is a plain statement of fact.

But illegal tend to stay away from govt not seek it out. Unlikely they would try to vote en masse like so many are claiming.

In America, requiring ID was not about identifying the voter. It was about suppressing votes. The GOP didnt care about it until recently.

936059333703544832 2017-11-29 02:28:30 UTC <Keds1250878727> @RealJamesWoods @RickRickkimball It became an issue when Cons started trying to suppress the vote through gerrymandering for a statt then they moved to fear mongering. There has never been such charges until GOP got control.  Weirdly,  while they got control, they still blame Dems for fraud?

Traditional phone companies arent a monopoly anymore. If a new company wants to offer internet/IP phone/cable or whatever they can do so. No regs to stop them. The regs applied to traditional dial tone.

The fiber network is separate from the old dial tone network. It isnt regulated the same. Any provider who wants to build a network can do so.

932107204852965376 2017-11-18 04:44:10 UTC <Keds1250878727> @Batt3B @nwsltrMe And just so you know, a woman who stands up for what she believes in, and opposes those who, dont isnt hysterics. So you can drop that .
932106669580079104 2017-11-18 04:42:02 UTC <Keds1250878727> @Batt3B @nwsltrMe Yeah its really hilarious that we had a chance for a strong, American woman for our prez and instead ended up with this whiney, corrupt, thieving, traitor. Real funny.

He admitted to stepping over the line, apologized for it and for spoiling the tour for her. Keep in mind they were rehearsing a skit. Hes a comedian who went overboard. Not the same as what Trump & the others are being accused of.

931618475226877953 2017-11-17 20:22:07 UTC <Keds1250878727> @StevenTDennis @LadyGodiva1234 Not just earned. We paid directly from our paycheck to Medicare, and to Social Security. These taxes are separate from the income tax they also took out. If we are not going to receive the benefit we PAID FOR then stop the deduction & let US save it.

As for the skit,  she told him no practice several times. And then gave in to shut him up. I suspect she knew what was going to happen but it was her choice to take the chance.

931419668660850689 2017-11-16 07:12:08 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ObamaMalik Apparently that was a younger Democrat DJT who at one time cared a little about people. Or maybe it was all to get his name in the paper. Who knows? But that isnt who he is today and he shows you every day.

He obviously knows the limits which makes me think the kiss was just a really bad idea gone wrong. I suspect she knew what was possibly going to happen because she said no several times before giving in.

930704590374424576 2017-11-14 07:50:40 UTC <Keds1250878727> @tribelaw @RozzieVox What Russian sanctions? The ones Trump signed but didnt activate? They skipped part 1 (Russia) that was due Oct 1. Said the Russian sanctions were too complex to get done by Oct 1. Waiting for SoS to gut his agency further? Or weaken Treasury dept?

You dont seem to believe in the actions other people took to remove him from his trolling place at the mall. Or the girl reporting to her mother at the time of the incident.

Same as gutting the state dept who handles the sanctions signed by trump. Same as shuffling the cyber security division down deeper in the state dept so they have more layers of people to approve action.
929634290991812608 2017-11-12 08:57:41 UTC <Keds1250878727> Did anyone notice the GOP is taking another run at whittling away abortion rights again in their new tax cuts for the wealthy bill? Havent seen any dicussion but maybe i missed it.

899674533787049986 2017-08-21 16:48:18 UTC <Keds1250878727> @RickMello18 They had to twist his arm to get it. Somehow that rings hollow to me...

899673576483192834 2017-08-21 16:44:30 UTC <Keds1250878727> @richc580 And that actually means squat. You have to look at what he does and says, not who he's relayed to.

898138691515940865 2017-08-17 11:05:25 UTC <Keds1250878727> @josephwilson86 Trump hasn't controlled him either. Kim has always blustered like all that were before him. Its a test on the new prez.  Never any action.
898137390258192385 2017-08-17 11:00:15 UTC <Keds1250878727> @josephwilson86 I have no blind deference for anyone. Unlike some i fact-check and research. And i have on occasion had to adjust my opinion with new info.
898136879303979008 2017-08-17 10:58:13 UTC <Keds1250878727> @josephwilson86 News has always reported on words & deeds of Presidents. They didn't like it but they knew free press was indispensable to democracy.
898135219143942146 2017-08-17 10:51:37 UTC <Keds1250878727> To ask questions and expect straight truthful answers is disrespect? When did that happen??
898134754717032448 2017-08-17 10:49:46 UTC <Keds1250878727> Thats exactly what Trump wants. Tgen the only news will be what he wants you to know. All aboard! First floor...dictatorship step one!

897668286871154689 2017-08-15 03:56:12 UTC <Keds1250878727> @DailyCaller That should be illegal since abortion is legal by law. The state has no right to create obstacles for a womans right to control her own body

895923206145671168 2017-08-11 08:21:52 UTC <Keds1250878727> Did you know there were 16 Democrat 'no' votes to every 1 Republican 'no' on the healthcare bill & thats why it failed? So says Gingrich.
895921458370801664 2017-08-11 08:14:55 UTC <Keds1250878727> Gingrich claims for every Republican 'no' vote there were 16 Democratic 'no' votes & thats why the healthcare plan failed. Fuzzy math?

894079481815724032 2017-08-05 06:15:34 UTC <Keds1250878727> @pressel_richard Maybe because no illegal acts were found in the many investigations that have been done?
894078769966829568 2017-08-05 06:12:44 UTC <Keds1250878727> @pressel_richard But he should have another official (translator, aide who is not family, or cabinet member) present & note taker present.

892282503553310720 2017-08-01 07:15:01 UTC <Keds1250878727> @politico Why are they so dead set on getting partisan healthcare through. Why not get both sides together & get this done already?

890070432128303107 2017-07-25 04:45:02 UTC <Keds1250878727> @POTUS @VP You care nothing about the people who are being helped on ACA. For you & the jackass in th WH & the killer Repugnants its all about the win
890069879293870080 2017-07-25 04:42:50 UTC <Keds1250878727> @POTUS @VP ACA may be failing but its had a lot of help from this Repugnant congress & the jackass we call the president.

889945690536890368 2017-07-25 20:29:21 UTC <Keds1250878727> @rtjcmi What do atheists "openly practice"? How do you practice non- religion? Just asking...
889944213487595521 2017-07-25 20:23:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> @MichaelCBender Well, maybe Sessions would like to join a bigger crowd and impeach trump.

889690194248708096 2017-07-24 03:34:06 UTC <Keds1250878727> @Reid_CO Breitbart claimed, falsely, that Clinton wanted to shut them down. They called it Sharia, frightening, totalitarianism. (Aug 2016).
889654003822456836 2017-07-24 01:10:18 UTC <Keds1250878727> @yashar McCain is a fool. He should worry about his health and not that piece of  they call a healthcare plan. The vote can wait. Forever.

889620965575053314 2017-07-24 22:59:01 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FoxNews @Thixon So if they have been here decades, have a business, productive life, you would deport? Cause them to lose their livelihood?
889620353777094658 2017-07-24 22:56:35 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FoxNews @Thixon Business Tax number. they got SSN also. Nothing says they can't if they are working here.
889619747809243136 2017-07-24 22:54:10 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FoxNews @Thixon They came to escape violence and drug dealers. To make a better life for their families. Productive people who only want a safe home

889543726162423812 2017-07-24 17:52:05 UTC <Keds1250878727> @DarickR Because trump has no idea how to be a leader. Barking orders and demanding action of others is how this jackass runs his businesses.

889539569347158018 2017-07-24 17:35:34 UTC <Keds1250878727> @HRepeating That is a serious problem. If half the people don't believe the press, the gov't is halfway to suppressing it & making state run news.

888249898591813632 2017-07-20 04:10:53 UTC <Keds1250878727> @PhoenixCE i also don't like a federal voter registration. It would be abused and used for voter suppression & gerrymandering which is bad already
888249212768575488 2017-07-20 04:08:09 UTC <Keds1250878727> @PhoenixCE I didn't say that. I don't see why this is such an issue that it requires a committee at federal level & the expense.

888026804342185985 2017-07-20 13:24:23 UTC <Keds1250878727> Yes, Trump did wish him well.
888024046075609088 2017-07-20 13:13:25 UTC <Keds1250878727> I really do believe Trump is in a hurry to destroy America before he's impeached. Either that or he's a Russian shill destroying America.
888023234645549056 2017-07-20 13:10:12 UTC <Keds1250878727> Trump is a Russian agent. Bought and paid for. And very likely Tillerson too.http://shareblue.com/trump-retreats-issues-stand-down-order-against-russian-cyberattacks/

883483397942890496 2017-07-07 00:30:31 UTC <Keds1250878727> Its Friday nite! Where is Rachel Maddow? There is someone else in her time slot!

883284105273761792 2017-07-07 11:18:35 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CBSNews What?! No Trump style jerk and pull handshake for Putin? So he does know how to do a proper handshake. I guess the other is Trump armwrestle
883282578886860802 2017-07-07 11:12:32 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @jules_su In case you didn't know, immigrants can't apply for govt assistance for 5years. Thats a long time to be hungry.

882221916748222464 2017-07-04 12:57:50 UTC <Keds1250878727> @LessGovMoreFun At least the Dems want to give it back in service to the citizens. Repubs just want to take it for themselves and be-damned to the citizens.

882203273222115328 2017-07-04 11:43:45 UTC <Keds1250878727> @rustyweiss74 Big falsehood? So it wasn't 17 agencies but it was the agency representing all 17 intel agencies +NSA,FBI &CIA being involved. Facts stand.

875678126206046208 2017-06-16 11:35:09 UTC <Keds1250878727> @iamAtheistGirl @atleasttim I agree some religious beliefs are dangerous. Choosing to recieve blood or not is a personal belief, freely chosen.

874690164282580992 2017-06-13 18:09:20 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @RobertMaguire_ Thats because white supremacists are "his people". He probably has a white hood he puts on in private.

874408257556807681 2017-06-12 23:29:08 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill Trump is so afraid of what is coming he fires everyone in position to investigate. Even someone he claimed to respect. Sad.

874053945320235009 2017-06-11 00:01:14 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill I don't think I would be taking any advice, legal or otherwise, from Trumps lawyer.

873766722934800388 2017-06-10 04:59:55 UTC <Keds1250878727> @POTUS @VP Its a disaster because the gov't is not supporting it according to Trump. His intention is to make it fail by taking no action/ funding
873761741364244480 2017-06-10 04:40:07 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill @hotfunkytown Meuller has the memos.

873759240694976513 2017-06-10 04:30:11 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill TRUMP! GIVE UP THE TAPES...or admit you lied....again

873692482487365638 2017-06-10 00:04:54 UTC <Keds1250878727> @POTUS @VP He's slashing every accomplishment of Obama and doesn't even know what they are about. If Obama signed it, Trump is against it. Period.

871261551721816064 2017-06-04 07:05:15 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill Maybe because we weren't weak in 1997? We had an educated prez in '97.Trumps lack of knowledge & understanding puts USA in very bad position

870712192554811392 2017-06-02 18:42:18 UTC <Keds1250878727> @sahouraxo @archuleta_69 If its all fake news, why the heat? Afraid of what they are finding?
870711426234540032 2017-06-02 18:39:15 UTC <Keds1250878727> @JournalNEO @sahouraxo Running scared if their going with this nonsense again.
870711003331215360 2017-06-02 18:37:34 UTC <Keds1250878727> @JournalNEO Better question: will there be a place for ANYONE in Trumps world.
870710472709767173 2017-06-02 18:35:28 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill @barkatem it wasn't a quagmire except in his own mind. He has no idea what the Paris Accord entailed & from your response i don't think you do either.
870709822378856448 2017-06-02 18:32:53 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill @AdamThompson48 Bet they would. And blame it on Hillary or somebody
870709277190635526 2017-06-02 18:30:43 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill DJT has no idea what the Paris Accord is about. He didn't read anything & thinks every pact is a negotiating ploy 'cause that's all he knows
870708284709261313 2017-06-02 18:26:46 UTC <Keds1250878727> @NewYorker @WendyVoss @bubbyandflapo That is exactly the reason. Trump really did not expect to win & didn't look too happy when he realized he won.
870687673563754496 2017-06-02 17:04:52 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @votevets @Thoe85Tom Well, in his defense, still being on active duty he really had no choice since Trump is his commander-in- chief. I feel sorry for him.

870631292253069312 2017-06-02 13:20:50 UTC <Keds1250878727> @VP @FoxNews @TeluguMan Look at what California has done. Jobs, great economy, great conservation, strict emmissions control. If it works there it should everywhere

870624431458050048 2017-06-02 12:53:34 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost @CNNPolitics @SLBYYZCAL That has changed recently as new facts have been uncovered and testifying to investigative committees.

870620850201870337 2017-06-02 12:39:20 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FoxNews @SW_Crisis Remotely possible but I don't believe his mind works that way. He doesn't seem to understand consequnces of what he says/does, good or bad.
870620252903587841 2017-06-02 12:36:58 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FoxNews @RUSTIMCCOLLUM Haven't of that but heard of the tecent killing by a thug.

870599460736204801 2017-06-02 11:14:21 UTC <Keds1250878727> @DonaldJTrumpJr @ChrisRBarron I still think he couldn't care less.

870594160964784130 2017-06-02 10:53:17 UTC <Keds1250878727> @EricTrump Which means exactly....nothing.
870590243820392448 2017-06-02 10:37:43 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Its not negotional. Either we meet expectations or we don't.

870589404468830210 2017-06-02 10:34:23 UTC <Keds1250878727> The only unnecessary burden is in the WH.
870589173547229185 2017-06-02 10:33:28 UTC <Keds1250878727> LIE, you lie. Just natural to you. All your business assoc say so too.
870587543590387713 2017-06-02 10:26:59 UTC <Keds1250878727> @JustinTrudeau @dananeast What part don't you understand? Popular vote went to Hillary by 2.9million votes. Electoral College vote went to Trump. Too bad we have EC.
870585888920567808 2017-06-02 10:20:25 UTC <Keds1250878727> @JustinTrudeau @mendezbryan15 @rostek_della There are a lot of really fine people in USA. Unfortunately Traitor Trump is prez & his followers are deaf & blind just like he wants them.

870562092134289408 2017-06-02 08:45:51 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNN Instead of waiting, why not look it up?
870561862575718401 2017-06-02 08:44:56 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNN @jairstream23 Maybe because both have such a lot of work to do to fix their own pollution problems?
870560407206768640 2017-06-02 08:39:09 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNN @theleftout Maybe you should read up on how much weather change is associated with that " fraction of 1 degree", hmm?
870545355808440320 2017-06-02 07:39:21 UTC <Keds1250878727> @politico Well....since he really doesn't understand how it works...
870505193015656448 2017-06-01 04:59:45 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FoxNews @bucaneropr Safe from what?

870502992671162368 2017-06-01 04:51:01 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FoxNews @SW_Crisis But he acts like he was raised in Russia.

870483928192176129 2017-06-01 03:35:15 UTC <Keds1250878727> @POTUS @FoxNews If you really listen carefully you will notice it is Trump exploding. You know about the strobing red lights in WH.? That was Trump. BOOM!

870482035348955137 2017-06-01 03:27:44 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump MAGA Trump. Resign and move to Russia.

870427665269792769 2017-06-01 23:51:41 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill @LisaLSLMT @BeaKinde @vonzion So you have already made a judgement call on evidence not in the public arena yet.....rrrright.

870424862153555969 2017-06-01 23:40:33 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics @POTUSThesaurus I want it done now also. Don't like to wait.

870413350051524608 2017-06-01 22:54:48 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump From the looks of it, it appears more than likely you are working on a deal to give us to Russia. How much are we worth, "Pres Trump"?
870409872843485184 2017-06-01 22:40:59 UTC <Keds1250878727> @funder @lackland50 Is every f'ing repub in Russia's pocket????
870407970957295622 2017-06-01 22:33:26 UTC <Keds1250878727> @politico So, another limb whittled from the tree of liberty. Without the bipartisan board there is no oversight.
870404707532939265 2017-06-01 22:20:28 UTC <Keds1250878727> @peterdaou @HowardCamerik Yeah, because that was so much worse than what Trump and his admin has done.

868932958505316358 2017-05-28 20:52:15 UTC <Keds1250878727> @POTUS @JoeBiden @FoxNews @vol80 Then you aren't listening to what Trump says.
868932402525155328 2017-05-28 20:50:03 UTC <Keds1250878727> @EricTrump @WattersWorld @FoxNews @MimisPavay @deborahtofte I think you misstook 'were' for 'we're'.

868929673409024004 2017-05-28 20:39:12 UTC <Keds1250878727> @100Concerned Like they are going to tell everything they know or are doing.
868927932009467904 2017-05-28 20:32:17 UTC <Keds1250878727> @100Concerned Such sleaze. Break the press, lose liberty. MSM

868919394717622272 2017-05-28 19:58:22 UTC <Keds1250878727> @EricTrump @WattersWorld @FoxNews @deborahtofte @MimisPavay Because the Repubs worked so hard to block everything he tried to do. And were proud of doing it.
868918354823852034 2017-05-28 19:54:14 UTC <Keds1250878727> @EricTrump @WattersWorld @FoxNews @moekamerow Have to disagree on the Fox News. They love him so much he tells them what to report and they do it.
868917840665088002 2017-05-28 19:52:11 UTC <Keds1250878727> @EricTrump @WattersWorld @FoxNews @chesterx29311 Yeah, he's popular Duterte, Putin, Erdogan, shall I go on? See a pattern here?

868913957293228032 2017-05-28 19:36:45 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill @texastruthtelle Another clueless Texan. Sometimes I am just ashamed of my state. Maybe she's a transplant from elsewhere?
868913040439345152 2017-05-28 19:33:07 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill @bravesjt Yet the republicans still can't manage to get anything done. Too busy covering their asses for when the investigation sucks them in?
868912011958259712 2017-05-28 19:29:01 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNMoney @CNNPolitics First he has to be honest with his words. You can't report what you want him to say. You can only report what he actually says.

868848066668920833 2017-05-28 15:14:56 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump Either leaks, therefore true,  or lies. Can't be both. Can't leak a lie.

868690550479876096 2017-05-27 04:49:01 UTC <Keds1250878727> @politico @stocktradr Hillary was prez? When did that happen?

868677862987005952 2017-05-27 03:58:36 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FoxNews You say that like she was guilty. Maybe you should read ALL of the judge's statement before you play that sad song.

868665695864852480 2017-05-27 03:10:15 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC Thats what Obama did. Now they still want to keep the    "Pre-existing " safety net for themselves but not for us.

868663978121207809 2017-05-27 03:03:26 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC @ggur077 The old white men in congress apparently.

868375739036467200 2017-05-27 07:58:04 UTC <Keds1250878727> @RedmondMichael @glssr33 Wasn't illegal, just ill-advised. Why don't you people cry about others in gov't with private servers?  Like Trump for example. And others.

868356540620832768 2017-05-26 06:41:47 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FoxNews So...if he had been a few months older he would have thought more like an adult? Like his partner? Not buying it.

868199940723539968 2017-05-26 20:19:30 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill @eenkblot Just like Trump. Are there no more adults around this admin?

868196001785556992 2017-05-26 20:03:51 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill Perfect for the Trump admin.

866548531426938881 2017-05-21 06:57:24 UTC <Keds1250878727> @FallingOffEarth Just to keep it straight, trump had already met Lavrov. This wasn't their first meeting.
866538076356706304 2017-05-21 06:15:51 UTC <Keds1250878727> @nytimesworld Short on facts there. Need to read up on why that happened. It was not his choice. Lol.

866353155126284292 2017-05-21 18:01:02 UTC <Keds1250878727> @puppymnkey Along with other facts.
866348305571348480 2017-05-21 17:41:46 UTC <Keds1250878727> @Reuters Russia will not cooperate in any meaningful way unless there is something in it fir them. Like maybe handing over America
866347781002342400 2017-05-21 17:39:41 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics @stephanieanne53 Yes he did. Often. Unfortunately he liked apologizing for America a little too much. But it went over well with most countries.

866344573928427520 2017-05-21 17:26:56 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics @Brooks8314 appears to me in what is purported to be the Obama photo, everyone is looking down at something on the ground. Look at the men around him.
866343500710916105 2017-05-21 17:22:41 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics @sicvic24 Because Trump is just currying favor. He doesn't mean what he says. Proof? Watch what he does and says when he's back home.
866342749011836928 2017-05-21 17:19:41 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics Like Trump right!?

866341457774485504 2017-05-21 17:14:34 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics Its all about the almighty dollar for Trump. He doesn't see people. He sees marks he can get money out of. Bottom line.

866298920137347072 2017-05-21 14:25:32 UTC <Keds1250878727> @knobcreek4ever Its a Muslim ban as stated by Trump. What else can you make it? He himself said it was.

866295712904089600 2017-05-21 14:12:47 UTC <Keds1250878727> @MiekeBush Trump put out an order to ban all muslims. It wasn't the "lefties" who did that. The " lefties" opposed it because it was a religious ban.

864865034090029057 2017-05-17 15:27:47 UTC <Keds1250878727> @JudicialWatch @TomFitton so we're only interested in transparency when looks like Trump is in hot water.. and only for the agencies who have the goods on him. Got it

864858109189246977 2017-05-17 15:00:16 UTC <Keds1250878727> @JudicialWatch @FoxFilesFNC Seems to me this may fall under national security. Anyway it is part of ongoing investigation s i don't see this happening.

864840248202854400 2017-05-17 13:49:17 UTC <Keds1250878727> @POTUS @FoxNews And why would we believe anything from Russia?
864810996791201793 2017-05-17 11:53:03 UTC <Keds1250878727> @politico @freshprynce_dc That is a tecord. Hey, Trump! You may be the first ever to be impeached in first year of your term. How do you like winning so far?
864810401195753474 2017-05-17 11:50:41 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC @LynnesCommunity What is fake about the truth?
864810067715141633 2017-05-17 11:49:22 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC @tmvlex Its called damage control.
864809815092191232 2017-05-17 11:48:21 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC @RBYORK Stupid move. Just compounds the problem. We would never have helped win WW2 with this lot.

864808170337824770 2017-05-17 11:41:49 UTC <Keds1250878727> @TODAYshow @GMA @ABC @MelissaWillis3 What is fake?
864808005270990848 2017-05-17 11:41:10 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC @wrongthinkradio So this bothers you more than what prez did?
864807557373865984 2017-05-17 11:39:23 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC Apparently ABC doesn't share the same concerns about reporting sensitive intel that WP kept back.
864807198916038657 2017-05-17 11:37:58 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC @wrongthinkradio Yes. But you can't leak whats already been released. Still,  they should not repeat it.
864806540125106177 2017-05-17 11:35:21 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC Thats why should not have spilled to Russia. This is what he doesn't understand about why he shouldn't tell all he thinks he knows.
864748616572973056 2017-05-17 07:45:11 UTC <Keds1250878727> @DavidCornDC @LeslieMarshall I bet that one we won't see. Unless they are begging for their jobs. O'll smile and say "deflection!"
864748015533346816 2017-05-17 07:42:47 UTC <Keds1250878727> @DavidCornDC Melt.

864690412879056896 2017-05-16 03:53:54 UTC <Keds1250878727> @SenSanders @dtrusmith @JackRya50620212 @biighub Well he did havk. And now we have the mess that will forever be known as TrumpRussia, Putins Puppet. Not MAGA to me.
864689641936519169 2017-05-16 03:50:50 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill @KayDeLoach I think if you decide to check it out for real you will find Obama left us in pretty good shape. Except maybe our world standing.

864685098821660672 2017-05-16 03:32:47 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ggreenwald Excuse me if I don't contribute. I'll donate to Veterans instead

864681778832965632 2017-05-16 03:19:35 UTC <Keds1250878727> @washingtonpost @CarrieKelly17 And why would he be 'accountable' for making notes? Thats what good investigators do. Keep the facts straight.
864681222164951040 2017-05-16 03:17:23 UTC <Keds1250878727> @washingtonpost @CarrieKelly17 I'm saying he was making notes on an investigation and he shouldn't be spilling info to the one he's investigating.

864676669830959106 2017-05-16 02:59:17 UTC <Keds1250878727> @talkaboutit84 @thehill Trump knew what he was asking for was inconstitutional & he knew it was wrong. Thats why he asked the others to leave. Hope its on tape.
864675350613307392 2017-05-16 02:54:03 UTC <Keds1250878727> @politico Because Trump is his commander-in-chief and asked him to take that job. When your commander "asks" you do not say "Eh, I don't think so"...
864674723048902656 2017-05-16 02:51:33 UTC <Keds1250878727> @politico Keep in mind Trump is his commander in chief. It is his duty to back his commander.

864532766360252416 2017-05-16 17:27:28 UTC <Keds1250878727> @SenatorRisch @tedlieu So nothing is safe.

864515285851787264 2017-05-16 16:18:00 UTC <Keds1250878727> @DustinGiebel In thatcase he should have kept his mouth shut until he knew more about it. Oh! Thats right! Too many details in that briefing prior to meet
864514619070713856 2017-05-16 16:15:21 UTC <Keds1250878727> @TheTweetwit @TeaPainUSA Circular reasoning. Well known on Trump admin.

864514097462857729 2017-05-16 16:13:17 UTC <Keds1250878727> @ABC @BlackHatKatie Not fake. Trump admitted he did it.  But i do understand if you have trouble believing him.

864511691136147462 2017-05-16 16:03:43 UTC <Keds1250878727> Not because of anything you did.  But thanks for the good news anyway.
864506758743683072 2017-05-16 15:44:07 UTC <Keds1250878727> Easily duped? Or just caught out?

864495295186563072 2017-05-16 14:58:34 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CBSNews Yeah, like I'm going to believe the Kremlin. About as likely as I'll believe Trump.

863740111212752896 2017-05-14 12:57:44 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNN @Lorilulu62 Comey didn't say that. Trump said it and Comey hasn't spoken yet.

863738035149602816 2017-05-14 12:49:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNN @MorganSweat72 So, its just COINCIDENCE they were all investigating @TrumpRussia? You'd think Trump would be WILLING to have his name cleared.

863730260411600897 2017-05-14 12:18:36 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics @ukn96 Ah poor baby. Don't want to eat foods from the recommended food pyramid because a black woman is working to help keep kids healthier? Waa

863728048809668608 2017-05-14 12:09:48 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics @the_real_Lord Thats the only reason. If Melania had started it he would be bragging to the press.
863727647423156226 2017-05-14 12:08:13 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics @crawlmwc And where are all those snarky remarks about fat people? A healthy meal at least once a day exposes kids to good foods that MAY help health.
863727204668243968 2017-05-14 12:06:27 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics @crawlmwc No one is forcing YOU to feed your kids healthy meals but its good they get them at school. Pack your kids' lunch if you don't like it.
863726721064984577 2017-05-14 12:04:32 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics @crawlmwc Is she not allowed to speak? And why wouldn't you want school lunches to be healthy? I remember some I wouldn't have given my dog.
863726008213667841 2017-05-14 12:01:42 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CNNPolitics @saravern You got them confused with Fox (Faux ) News.

863720167653724160 2017-05-14 11:38:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill @MyPlace4U Well then they should be able to prove he did nothing wrong.

863714342369406977 2017-05-14 11:15:20 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill Let me guess...? Ryan? McConnell? Sessions? Flynn?
863713332687241216 2017-05-14 11:11:20 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @politico No matter what Trumpie says about MSM he can't live without them. He would shrivel up and die if they didn't show for the briefings.
863712536239230978 2017-05-14 11:08:10 UTC <Keds1250878727> @realDonaldTrump @politico What??? You don't want to know how often Trump lies to you??
863711901347348482 2017-05-14 11:05:38 UTC <Keds1250878727> @20committee @PatriotResistDT He probably thinks a thumb drive is something hitch hikers do
863711618265493505 2017-05-14 11:04:31 UTC <Keds1250878727> @20committee @PatriotResistDT I don't think so unless someone else made it. Trump doesn't use a computer . Doesn't know how.
863710435874361344 2017-05-14 10:59:49 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill @permabsence The only people Trump seems to respect are Putin, Edogan, and Kim. He does a fine job of disrespecting the Constitution and the rest of us

863693670498914304 2017-05-14 09:53:12 UTC <Keds1250878727> @CBSNews How about instead of building a useless billions$ wall we put that money to training teachers & school officials on how to handle bullying.

863604684635951104 2017-05-13 03:59:36 UTC <Keds1250878727> @Raider7Rich Definitely a Trump tactic and all his followers employ it also. Never think for themselves or just blind to his lies.
863604165171400704 2017-05-13 03:57:32 UTC <Keds1250878727> Doesn't compare to Trump Treason. After we get rid of Trumputin we  an start on the others who don't have loyalty to America. (Not "party")

863015106216693760 2017-05-12 12:56:50 UTC <Keds1250878727> He said he had no knowledge of collusion but that he would not necessarily know if there was one because he was not on that investigation.

863003445745205248 2017-05-12 12:10:29 UTC <Keds1250878727> Why did you block US press in favor of Tass in your meeting with your Russian handlers Lavrov & Kislyak this week?

862999556627288064 2017-05-12 11:55:02 UTC <Keds1250878727> Not fake if they are reporting on your TREASONOUS acts.
862999196810530816 2017-05-12 11:53:36 UTC <Keds1250878727> Trump, its over. Throw in the towel. Nobody cares about the election anymore.

862965086410944512 2017-05-12 09:38:04 UTC <Keds1250878727> @PhilipRucker Weird that he talks about himself as if "Trump" was a separate person. Maybe multiple personality?

862263084819390464 2017-05-10 11:08:34 UTC <Keds1250878727> @politico Of course they are. The more, the merrier I guess

862261522072055808 2017-05-10 11:02:21 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill Such a persuasive argument. Are you sure you can't do better?....well, maybe not.
862261088217436160 2017-05-10 11:00:38 UTC <Keds1250878727> @thehill I knew of her before but not a lot. Why is that an issue?

861852453951741952 2017-05-09 07:56:52 UTC <Keds1250878727> @codykeenan Considering how the present admin works i guess they would have to even though i think that is a little silly. Come on...flowers?
