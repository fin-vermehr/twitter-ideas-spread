953035042443362306 2018-01-15 22:43:55 UTC <myskinisthin> @musicoins This is great and all... But you need to build more incentives for users to buy musicoin.  Right now there is a sell pressure from the artists.  There needs to be buy side pressure also to keep the price improving.

951504585893535744 2018-01-11 17:22:26 UTC <myskinisthin> @musicoins 1/2 You need other products to incentivize users to buy musicoin: concert tickets, swag etc. Add ability for "bands" to automatically divide coins among members/producers/song writers etc. Maybe create a "proof of ownership" for artists that they can use to licence their music.

943206412674531328 2017-12-19 19:48:27 UTC <myskinisthin> @BITCOlNCASH can someone answer my question: W/ "gigablocks" isn't Bitcoin Cash's "centralized hub" argument against @lightning a bit hypocritical? Won't bigger blocks mean fewer nodes due to the increased data storage/bandwidth costs & fewer users with nodes ie centralization?
942556603588534273 2017-12-17 00:46:20 UTC <myskinisthin> @AlexanderHaxton Please check http://musicoin.org they have figured out a way to allow free listening to users and pay the artists at the same time.
942124179536732160 2017-12-16 20:08:02 UTC <myskinisthin> @gavinandresen @TerencesTweets @_Rain64 2/2(b)risks decreased verification; larger blocks will be harder to verify ie more centralization.  @lightning while yes centralized - certainly no more than $bch & I can imagine once it's truly active most transactions move off-chain making final $btc on-chain transactions cheap
942122946084171778 2017-12-16 20:03:08 UTC <myskinisthin> @lightning @gavinandresen @TerencesTweets @_Rain64 1/2 But that's what I am trying to understand... In $bch you have a increase in transaction speed which currently has allowed for a decrease in cost.  Their answer for "visa level" transactions is eventual "gigabyte blocks" which (a) centralizes it to people with that bandwidth
942120626176831489 2017-12-16 19:53:55 UTC <myskinisthin> @lightning @gavinandresen @TerencesTweets @_Rain64 Aren't the miners who are currently running Bitcoin Cash - "big companies"? Also: it's gonna take too long to implement is a cop-out because you are creating "new money" it's gonna take years for any new system to replace cash... Just like it took years for paper to replace gold.
942077522900119558 2017-12-16 17:02:39 UTC <myskinisthin> @gavinandresen This is true currently but wouldn't you imagine that with @lightning fully active most transactions will move off-chain and the eventually submission of the transactions to the blockchain will become a rare enough event that there will be a smaller cost?
942072389206265856 2017-12-16 16:42:15 UTC <myskinisthin> @gavinandresen @TerencesTweets Ok so...I am not understanding? What exactly is the critique against @lightning then? if every user doesn't need to be a node in $bch - there is then expectation of some level of centralization even in $bch, correct? So why is the "centralized hub" a bad thing in @lightning $btc?
942032567074770949 2017-12-16 14:04:00 UTC <myskinisthin> @gavinandresen Ok but w/ "gigablocks" isn't Bitcoin Cash's "centralized hub" argument against @lightning a bit hypocritical? Won't bigger blocks mean fewer nodes due to the increased data storage/bandwidth costs & fewer users with nodes ie centralization around business that can handle that?
941997549262696448 2017-12-16 11:44:51 UTC <myskinisthin> @BITCOlNCASH Ok but w/ "gigablocks" isn't Bitcoin Cash's "centralized hub" argument against @lightning a bit hypocritical? Won't bigger blocks mean fewer nodes due to the increased data storage/bandwidth costs & fewer users with nodes ie centralization around business that can handle that?
941874449648889857 2017-12-15 03:35:42 UTC <myskinisthin> @BITCOlNCASH ok yes I got it your transaction costs are cheaper... But what's your long term plan to get to 1000+ transactions per second?
941866714089783297 2017-12-15 03:04:58 UTC <myskinisthin> @chrisblockchain @_7even_ Any plan to allow $BCH with tumblebit/breeze?

941100876621631488 2017-12-13 00:21:48 UTC <myskinisthin> To the people thinking about buying into #btc #blockchain ignore the naysayers... You are buying "new money" - we have a long way to go...$5,100,000,000,000. That's trillion with a "t".http://www.businessinsider.com.au/charts-heres-how-much-currency-is-traded-on-average-every-day-2016-9
941096623098269696 2017-12-13 00:04:54 UTC <myskinisthin> @musicoins Because it will attract more eyes to the platform and get people to buy more coins for tipping.  But truthfully, until you create a "music ecosystem" - tickets, "swag," licensing-smart-contacts  etc tipping will only get us so far.

917474392996753409 2017-10-09 19:38:35 UTC <myskinisthin> @AmericanAir pilot's solution to no AC on PHL flight... Close the shades! hahaha that's customer service for ya! WTF?!?
917470429895385090 2017-10-09 19:22:50 UTC <myskinisthin> @AmericanAir no ac, sitting here in PHL for another 35 mins.  why board us?!?! WTF
917126781655764992 2017-10-08 20:37:18 UTC <myskinisthin> @musicoins ubi is great but the value of coins is only dictated by investor interest... I hope other ways to bring in "money" are coming.
916716767141158912 2017-10-07 17:28:03 UTC <myskinisthin> My conspiracy theory: @elonmusk is Satoshi.  Who else would want to convert electricity into money and is a brilliant techy.
915532163050811392 2017-10-04 11:00:52 UTC <myskinisthin> @NRA I guess Sandy Hook ended the gun debate. If the death of children you all could overlook... Then nothing was ever going to be done.
915176785209413632 2017-10-03 11:28:43 UTC <myskinisthin> Seriously Sandy Hook ended the gun debate.  When the death of children is something we could overlook... Nothing was ever going to be done.

914793929991688194 2017-10-02 10:07:23 UTC <myskinisthin> @dragonchaingang this send interesting but as an investor what does a token actually get me?
914455783835885568 2017-10-01 11:43:43 UTC <myskinisthin> @musicoins is there a way to do 2FA on our http://musicoin.org accounts? I couldn't figure it out.

910091401366470656 2017-09-19 10:41:13 UTC <myskinisthin> @stratisplatform 2/2 we need an API for this to allow others to develop off of... Perhaps a bounty if you are busy with breeze ;)
910090596643164160 2017-09-19 10:38:01 UTC <myskinisthin> @stratisplatform 1/2This is a proof of concept, but I imagine that "stratis identity" can become a base for all kinds of ideas: chat, trade, appointments etc
909957618235592706 2017-09-18 01:49:37 UTC <myskinisthin> This could become the basis of identity driven projects on stratis eg: chat, appointments, purchases etc. #HUGEhttps://twitter.com/stratisplatform/status/909870049195954176

909064423217729537 2017-09-16 14:40:22 UTC <myskinisthin> Bought into @ArkEcosystem their smartbridge tech could be the beginning of "internet of blockchains." #excitingtimes

907987537368698880 2017-09-13 15:21:13 UTC <myskinisthin> I think cnbc needs to learn about btc...I don't think any one of us cares what this idiot "old guard" thinks.https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/13/bitcoin-price-falls-on-worries-about-china-exchange-crackdown.html

905465855324155904 2017-09-06 16:20:57 UTC <myskinisthin> @omise_go @SingularDTV @golemproject Every eth token should be doing this.  You want the media to talk about you? Give away free money.
905455907819069440 2017-09-06 15:41:25 UTC <myskinisthin> @omise_go with the delay in the airdrop is the block height still going to be: 3988888?

904680635616419840 2017-09-04 12:20:46 UTC <myskinisthin> @musicoins @ssysys420 2/2 is there a plan to get money from advertising? From record label partnerships?
904680394783633408 2017-09-04 12:19:48 UTC <myskinisthin> @musicoins @ssysys420 1/2 just like steem... Musicoin value seems to be only created by the speculative investing.  Maybe I haven't done the research but
904672328268881921 2017-09-04 11:47:45 UTC <myskinisthin> @musicoins @ssysys420 Free listening will def increase listeners but how does that increase coin value? Are we really counting so much on speculative value?
903935222688964608 2017-09-02 10:58:46 UTC <myskinisthin> Stopped following all the "day traders" of coins on here...I was getting sucked into the FUD
903668288638636032 2017-09-01 17:18:04 UTC <myskinisthin> Ideas from a 7 year old: why don't we put glass walls around electric fences to protect the animals.
