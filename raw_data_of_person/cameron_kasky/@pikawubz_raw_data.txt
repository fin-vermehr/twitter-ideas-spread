943592139589644288 2017-12-20 21:21:11 UTC <pikawubz> @chief_spike No, it's that you have a big influence on my followers apparently 
943591913806024704 2017-12-20 21:20:17 UTC <pikawubz> Just did a huge server purge so if I left your server that's why
943327314133356544 2017-12-19 03:48:52 UTC <pikawubz> @chief_spike Yeah I've had thick cases on all of my phones except my axon 7 and Nokia lumia 521. Never got any physical damage except for my axon 7 and Nokia, both got little scratches or dents on the sides  Thick cases give me more peace of mind I guess 
943326166806654976 2017-12-19 03:44:18 UTC <pikawubz> Ok new poll boys
943324949539905541 2017-12-19 03:39:28 UTC <pikawubz> @chief_spike Ok then what do you think about this https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B074CMT7HV/ref=mp_s_a_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1513740974&sr=8-6&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=iphone%2Bx%2Bspigen&dpPl=1&dpID=31VUy6ZSVUL&ref=plSrch&th=1&psc=1

943322266108071936 2017-12-19 03:28:48 UTC <pikawubz> @chief_spike Also I don't like clear cases, they get yellow over time (at least in my experience) I did see a Spigen with a built in kickstand that looked nice tho.  Also keep in mind this is a fuckin $1000+ phone so gotta have max protection amirite no risking it
943321793917542400 2017-12-19 03:26:56 UTC <pikawubz> @chief_spike Welp here's the thing  My friend has an otterbox defender on his iPhone. He's dropped it an insane amount of times and he even took a drill to it apparently. His phone is still good

942233087865389056 2017-12-16 03:20:48 UTC <pikawubz> After thinking it over, I only have a small amount of real friends that I can talk with. People I know in real life. And to those people, thank you for dealing with my weirdness and my terrible social skills.
942233085814419456 2017-12-16 03:20:48 UTC <pikawubz> I can't even properly hold a conversation. Try with me, and it'll end up with the both of us going silent.
942233084266762242 2017-12-16 03:20:47 UTC <pikawubz> Before I thought that talking to strangers online helped me with my social skills online. Turns out it has made me a more socially awkward person that can't talk to anyone without a screen being a middleman.  In real life, I'm the social outcast that would rather talk to no one.
942233082576494592 2017-12-16 03:20:47 UTC <pikawubz> People I have known on the internet have resulted in me developing more anxiety and depression. I never thought that I would have feelings of depression at all in my entire life, but it has happened.
942212560694243328 2017-12-16 01:59:14 UTC <pikawubz> lol not doing the podcast until i can find a proper stream partner  until then probably just gonna fuck around on stream doing my normal shit (osu, music, etc)

941859805081362433 2017-12-15 02:37:31 UTC <pikawubz> @kp__music my guess was that i was trying to reinstall and during uninstall it wiped out my projects folder.  either that or i was deleting the crap that the uninstaller left behind with iobit uninstaller program and that resulted in the projects folder being deleted

933794690402537472 2017-11-23 20:29:37 UTC <pikawubz> there's a problem with discord  EVERYONE has their own server  Communities are fragmented  Why not just have everyone in one big happy server? that way it'll be active, no one's dead, etc. And people would be more enticed to join because of the large community size/activeness

933425280554885120 2017-11-22 20:01:43 UTC <pikawubz> After doing some more research my conclusions are as follows:  If you want to get rid of #NetNeutrality, you also need to get rid of ISP monopolies.  Views are still subject to change, this is a topic with a lot of info behind it and a lot of viewpoints.

933197258719363074 2017-11-21 04:55:39 UTC <pikawubz> I haven't read Title II in it's entirety so who knows, there might be something about government control / censorship of the internet that is concerning.
933196788655370240 2017-11-21 04:53:47 UTC <pikawubz> Reading up on the opposing side of the net neutrality issue, and it's pretty intriguing  Problem is I don't see how getting rid of Title II would result in more competition since ISPs already have monopolies in areas (i.e. I can only get comcast in my area)

867211060213932032 2017-05-23 02:50:03 UTC <pikawubz> @CozanGaming it gets tricky with my music syncing program. basically it scans for the tunes already on the phone and then transfers them over iftheyarent

867190060629807104 2017-05-23 01:26:36 UTC <pikawubz> was so close to winning $20 from a friend but epically failed.
867125876063965186 2017-05-23 21:11:33 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr yeh. and the awful latency can really affect you if you have slow internet in the first place.
867125619825532928 2017-05-23 21:10:32 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr we all know the free VPNs are trash, speeds usually suck on those and privacy is shady.
867125469719777282 2017-05-23 21:09:57 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr and i guess you're right about the VPN thing. though it's an extra cost that some people might not be willing to pay.
867125299573653509 2017-05-23 21:09:16 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr you're right on the monopolies lol. they suck ass and theres a reason why government regulation makes it so that they can't happen.
867123766677168128 2017-05-23 21:03:11 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr So I can't hop over to FiOS cause they're like "WE ARE FREE AND OPEN" while Comcast is going to shit, because I only have one to choose from
867123533767471105 2017-05-23 21:02:15 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr That doesn't work when there's a monopoly basically
867123497474109446 2017-05-23 21:02:06 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr Also, when you only have 1 ISP in your area (like me, only Comcast), you can't switch. Free market promotes competition.
867123296302706688 2017-05-23 21:01:18 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr Notwhen mostof today's population is relianton the Internet, and ifsomethinglike thatoccurred it would endup being the opposite ofbeneficial
867121260538597377 2017-05-23 20:53:13 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr Yeah, but if companies start slowing down other sites/blocking access bc of monetary reasons, isn't that kinda like corruption?
867092019243614208 2017-05-23 18:57:01 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr he appointed an FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai, who is anti-net neutrality. they voted not too long ago to start overturning net neutrality rules

866809037610000384 2017-05-22 00:12:33 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr he's done some questionable things however, for example the net neutrality stuff
866808761951936512 2017-05-22 00:11:28 UTC <pikawubz> @JrdnThMncrftr also trump isn't that bad of a dood. i think the media is painting him to be worse than he rlly is. he's really just a huge meme lmao.

755751765052645377 2016-07-20 13:10:36 UTC <pikawubz> Yep the #PokemonGo fad will pass away while I'm still relying on free Wi-Fi networks.
755751548421083136 2016-07-20 13:09:44 UTC <pikawubz> My parents said once I get a job, I can get data. But they won't allow me to have a job during the school year bc I should be focused on HW.
755751331256827904 2016-07-20 13:08:53 UTC <pikawubz> Everyone I know (except one) has their data paid for by their parents.
