971542219235708928 2018-03-07 00:24:50 UTC <mcpierce> @ErikToddDellums I totally agree. I dont understand the need some people have to go out and kill an animal for no other reason than sport. What is lacking in their being that they need to take a life to feel complete?

971514284973977603 2018-03-07 22:33:50 UTC <mcpierce> @Aikijohnny Oh, that would be a great guest appearance. To have @WilliamShatner on as one of Yvette's cohorts, he'd bring a whole new level of fun to the story and bring in new viewers to the show.
971513798560501766 2018-03-07 22:31:54 UTC <mcpierce> @WilliamShatner More or less. A great cast, and @JasonRitter has a certain charisma that makes the show work.

Its the conservatives who keep tanking efforts to I prove education by trying to privatize it as a for-profit elite system.

The population density is heavier in the blue areas with mostly empty land and livestock in the red areas.
970487040499478528 2018-03-04 02:31:55 UTC <mcpierce> @DLoesch @NRATV @LibertyRansom The NRA is afraid that kids practicing their 1A rights threatens their 2A rights.

967732071568498688 2018-02-25 12:04:40 UTC <mcpierce> @Alyssa_Milano They dont, or refuse, to get it. They didnt pull the trigger in Parkland, but their money is what completely influenced politicians to make that possible. They are the ones who want more guns sold including to the mentally unstable. They bear responsibility.

967730152817025024 2018-02-25 11:57:02 UTC <mcpierce> @DavidCornDC Oh, he didnt read anything....he has the same canned set of accusations for anything that comes out. Its always Obama/the Democrats/Hillary to blame for anything. But those excuses cant work forever....

967726249945829376 2018-02-25 11:41:32 UTC <mcpierce> @JamesGunn @silenttheo @KrispyKRAME_2 No it wont since it shows that the number of private guns owned has no bearing on intentional homicider rates. If it did then the US would be st the far left of the graph. Want to try again?

967154860075507712 2018-02-23 21:51:02 UTC <mcpierce> @funder I honestly don't think Obama would have gone in, nor would we have expected him to. But he's at least adult enough to not start calling someone else names like @realDonaldTrump did.
967003274875371520 2018-02-23 11:48:41 UTC <mcpierce> @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump @CNNPR @Daniela0325 So if they arent constantly crying then you think its false?
967002253587558400 2018-02-23 11:44:37 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman True story?
966838021994827781 2018-02-22 00:52:02 UTC <mcpierce> @pattonoswalt Have you seen their attempts at doing a Daily Show style show? It just comes across as really bad mean girl shit. Conservative views dont translate to higher brow humor.
966834465266962432 2018-02-22 00:37:54 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman Make Batman a straight up detective noir story. Superman can be a thriller or a deconstruction of Clark Kent and dont play up the super powers. WW was fine.
966833888235470848 2018-02-22 00:35:36 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman I totally agree there. I had high hopes after WW but its not working yet. They need to learn from Marvel and write the story for the character and not write superhero films.
966833437268152320 2018-02-22 00:33:48 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman Im almost afraid to ask you about Battlefield: Earth now....
966832843669278721 2018-02-22 00:31:27 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman MOS suffered from again going to far from the source material. Visually pretty cool but otherwise it was meh.
966832645656203264 2018-02-22 00:30:40 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman And Margot Robbie was okay. I live the character of Harley but she just didnt give her the depth of insane genius the character deserves.
966832448226168832 2018-02-22 00:29:53 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman I thought SS didnt play up on the team part of the story. Too much Deadshot. I get it they were glad to have Will Smith but they had other actors too. Cant name them because they didnt get enough story.
966831945807286272 2018-02-22 00:27:53 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman Canadian Batman!https://goo.gl/images/qzcVAK
966831572333875200 2018-02-22 00:26:24 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman I feel ya. They went too far afield if the source material and it didnt work. How did you feel about Suicide Squad and Man Of Steel?
966831171052163073 2018-02-22 00:24:48 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman Gotta disagree here. His suit was pretty well done IMO. I just wish theyd gone with a younger actor. Batman and Superman are supposed to be of an age, near their late 20s to early 30s.
966830801592741890 2018-02-22 00:23:20 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman I like Jason Momoa as Aquaman but dont know why they went so far away for him and Barry Allen looks wise. And Ray Fisher got nowhere near enough screen time.
966830397047877633 2018-02-22 00:21:44 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman I like how Affleck looked as Batman. Hes the closest Ive seen to how a real Batman would look. Gail Gadot is visually....um, good.
966829713695150080 2018-02-22 00:19:01 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman Agreed. I wish theyd ask real fans to help develop the films rather than just throwing shit at a wall.
966829462875668481 2018-02-22 00:18:01 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman And that would be a launching point for Shazam in another year or two.
966829377681018881 2018-02-22 00:17:41 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman And their goal at first is to deal with something more earth-centric. Maybe somehow use Black Adam as the big bad trying to reclaim Kandaq and they fight him to save the modern country.
966828815916912640 2018-02-22 00:15:27 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman But now lets figure out what would have been a better JL film story? I would have kept the Flash-from-the-future come back and contact Batman and have that be what gets him to bring the others together.
966828305457598465 2018-02-22 00:13:25 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman Ha! I see what you did there!
966827664261681153 2018-02-22 00:10:52 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman I kind of agree. I wish they wouldnt come out right away with such a big bad in the film. Or maybe have had it parallel the New 52 JL relaunch....but they tried to boil the ocean.

966710281769570304 2018-02-22 16:24:26 UTC <mcpierce> @funder @sahluwal The guns will have labels marking them as school property, but the teachers will have to send home notes asking parents to supply the bullets.

Only DHS memo ordering a change of priorities. Ill gladly believe it was an EO if you can show me a reference to the EO itself. Can you do that?

Again, DACA was a DHS policy statement, not an EO. But since you say only Congress can change anything then are you saying Trump, who signed nothing but EOs relating to immigration, also did things illegally?

The policy doesn't violate the law, it states where the focus is to be placed.  But, do please tell us what law is violated. You don't even need to be specific: a general answer will suffice.

The GOP has had the majority since 2010 and was known as the Do Nothing Congress due to only working to undermine Obama.   http://bfy.tw/Geks

DACA was meant to be a temporary measure until the DREAM Act was passed. But the GOP was too busy undermining Obama to do their job with it.
964827860023181312 2018-02-17 11:44:22 UTC <mcpierce> @realDonaldTrump @JasonHirschhorn @SandraJFrancis1 So even when presented with fact you cling to a lie?  https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf

953228314994511872 2018-01-16 11:31:55 UTC <mcpierce> @BillKristol I think todays conservatives treat him like their Jesus: they claim to worship him but ignore his words and actions.

952339352520200192 2018-01-13 00:39:29 UTC <mcpierce> @whoisgarylee Thank you for sharing. Your story was very touching and awesome!
951947804867485697 2018-01-12 22:43:37 UTC <mcpierce> @JamesGunn Especially since they keep claiming everything Obama did was bad.
951941730433105920 2018-01-12 22:19:29 UTC <mcpierce> @AlbertBrooks Turn on Cartoon Network in the Oval Office and give him a bowl of Cheerios and a Diet Coke.

951483449835171840 2018-01-11 15:58:26 UTC <mcpierce> @JohnCleese Would they have liked it if wed been friendly to Hitler?
951439224074637312 2018-01-11 13:02:42 UTC <mcpierce> @Briligerent Yeah @davidcrosss not cool. Do you not have a little decorum?
950801199116275712 2018-01-09 18:47:25 UTC <mcpierce> @BillKristol I think its more a case@of not wanting another unqualified tv personality in the WH. We need experience not a cult of personality.
950694230439202817 2018-01-09 11:42:22 UTC <mcpierce> @WilliamShatner Bonjour monsieur capitaine!
950150016982835200 2018-01-07 23:39:51 UTC <mcpierce> @ChrisEvans Dayum thats cold. Accurate, but cold. And spot on! #Brrrr

949093356424048640 2018-01-04 01:41:04 UTC <mcpierce> @GordQuotes It's a tie for me:  "You've come too far to feel like this, I've come to far to feel like that."  and just the title for "It's a good life if you don't weaken".  #GordDownie
949092355327619072 2018-01-04 01:37:05 UTC <mcpierce> @SenSanders But I thought the Republicans were all about states' rights?

949091277752209408 2018-01-04 01:32:48 UTC <mcpierce> @kumailn And, based on the Don Jr.'s posts, Eric's the SMART Trump!
949090259123560448 2018-01-04 01:28:45 UTC <mcpierce> @perlmutations I can't imagine a President Pence. He's scary in a differently stupid kind of way...
949002933114318850 2018-01-04 19:41:45 UTC <mcpierce> @NASA @FAANews @USDOT @ShuttleCDRKelly This. Absolutely this!
948387122720968704 2018-01-02 02:54:44 UTC <mcpierce> @realDonaldTrump You meant the seventh year in a row?
948386768277196800 2018-01-02 02:53:20 UTC <mcpierce> @BillKristol Unbelievable that were here in less than a year of his administration.

947815881517694976 2018-01-01 13:04:50 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman A better, more liver theater. Anything else would be a liver worst theater experience.
947814741786923008 2018-01-01 13:00:18 UTC <mcpierce> @julieklausner @MKupperman I thought you were the other one. You know, the one that had the thing. That one.
947813126329847808 2018-01-01 12:53:53 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman It also cures laryngitis.
947680377791008769 2017-12-31 04:06:23 UTC <mcpierce> @SheriffClarke @MKupperman I just picture him with the big Puss In Boots eyes offering his vulnerable belly to someone who was a liberal and that person eviscerating him.  What else could explain such irrational posturing?
947679597751078912 2017-12-31 04:03:17 UTC <mcpierce> @julieklausner @MKupperman Wait, which one was you?
947524169692000256 2017-12-31 17:45:40 UTC <mcpierce> @JohnCleese Ive watched the series over and over for years and only JUST learned the town wasnt named Tall Key. Damn the internet is fascinating.... #EverSeeMyWifeMakeToast
947508799509876741 2017-12-31 16:44:36 UTC <mcpierce> @POTUS @EdMarkey @tedlieu That we live in a time when such legislation is needed and quickly makes me sad.
947440476193517569 2017-12-31 12:13:06 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman Have you watched CHUD yet?
947439189834063872 2017-12-31 12:08:00 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman My wife got him the complete series of Hogans Heroes on dvd. Cant wait till he starts pointing out how CBS didnt research every detail before filming. #MyBoyTheNerd #IKnowNothing
947438809742036993 2017-12-31 12:06:29 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman My son is the same way but with WWII movies. He loves to point out the subtle historical inaccuracies when it comes to tanks. And gets giddy when they use something obscure but accurate. Hes a history major at uni and focuses on WWII in case you didnt catch that. #MyBoyTheNerd
947438172316815361 2017-12-31 12:03:57 UTC <mcpierce> @WilliamShatner That seems about right. Oxidation is a big problem, along with rancidity. The bag, if you keep the air out, will help the milk last longer than it would in cartons. #MilkScience
947084095443689473 2017-12-30 12:36:58 UTC <mcpierce> @TheDweck Boom! You now have possession of the entire internet for one day. Be benevolent. :D

946727474536337409 2017-12-29 12:59:53 UTC <mcpierce> @WilliamShatner Ive been rewatching The Dick Van Dyke Show this past year and had rediscovered her charm and humor. RIP Sally!
946509435454844934 2017-12-28 22:33:29 UTC <mcpierce> Happy birthday to two great people:  My father, Linwood, who ee lost way too soon and just before I as born.   @TheRealStanLee, whose imagination was a huge influence on my childhood.   Bonne anniversaire!
946509025306345472 2017-12-28 22:31:51 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman I follow his hairs Twitter feed. It said it all started with a large bump on its ass....
946507633573408768 2017-12-28 22:26:19 UTC <mcpierce> @WilliamShatner Is it Freudian that he called himself an ARMerican? Gun fetishists scare me...

945625068184522752 2017-12-26 11:59:19 UTC <mcpierce> @MKupperman Does this person always have candy corn at Halloween and a fruit cake handy?
945624874818686976 2017-12-26 11:58:33 UTC <mcpierce> @chrislhayes Congratulations!

945368428231131136 2017-12-25 18:59:32 UTC <mcpierce> @BethesdaStudios @Fallout I know I did: my awesome wife got me the Fallout Worker Bundle!
945349901663207429 2017-12-25 17:45:54 UTC <mcpierce> Watching Silicon Cowboys and just saw @WilliamShatner and the VIC=20 commercial from the day.
945285736202465286 2017-12-25 13:30:56 UTC <mcpierce> Another family tradition completed: the baking of the scratch made banana bread for breakfast. Oh, it feels like forever till it's cool enough to slice and eat. #HappyChristmas #JoyeuxNoel

945120718441930752 2017-12-24 02:35:13 UTC <mcpierce> @Nick_Offerman I read that thread backwards. It was strange.
945112598911049728 2017-12-24 02:02:57 UTC <mcpierce> @WilliamShatner @petris32 @AngryAlanRants @vijTyrghFPbpR4s Haha. Same here. Not that I care: I never saw him before and dont care if I never see him again.
945112325169786880 2017-12-24 02:01:52 UTC <mcpierce> @WilliamShatner Was that the one with the Klingons fighting Santa when he tried to recruit new elves from the Vulcan embassy?
945110953502363649 2017-12-24 01:56:25 UTC <mcpierce> @WilliamShatner What would the Kirk version of the Picard Manouver be called then?
945094623906746369 2017-12-24 00:51:32 UTC <mcpierce> @WilliamShatner @petris32 @AngryAlanRants You mean this flag code?   http://www.usflag.org/uscode36.html#176  Isnt that the same code that says wearing the flag is disrespectful? I notice that what is NOT in there is that the flag is more important than the rights in the Constitution.
945090833778438144 2017-12-24 00:36:28 UTC <mcpierce> @WilliamShatner @petris32 @AngryAlanRants So youd rather deny them the rights that flag represents because they dont treat your preferred symbol as you like? Thats pretty close to fascism sir.
945090338565312513 2017-12-24 00:34:30 UTC <mcpierce> @tagaq Im an atheist, but my wife and I let the kids believe in Santa when they were little. But we also taught them to be rational and they realized it wasnt true.
945065332414337024 2017-12-24 22:55:08 UTC <mcpierce> @GOP @cmclymer Correction: he's not using public funds...the GOP/RNC appear to be wasting donations on this shite.
945065136531869696 2017-12-24 22:54:21 UTC <mcpierce> @GOP @cmclymer Trump is only interested in creating the appearance of supporting (and being supported by) veterans. Why else is he begging them to get a sticker? And it's free because he's using public funds to pay for it...
945064638672265216 2017-12-24 22:52:22 UTC <mcpierce> @BarackObama @JordanUhl Is that for real? (hits the googles) Ah, just a meme. And, sadly, almost the perfect Poe for the season...
945063772615528448 2017-12-24 22:48:56 UTC <mcpierce> @ChurchofSatan What was that about the Devil and the details? :D
945063543187169280 2017-12-24 22:48:01 UTC <mcpierce> @profanityswan This is, by far, the greatest tweet in the universe! I'm swooning as I re-read it and truly absorb it into my soul! :D  Happy Xmas! Joyeux Nol! And fuck the haters! :D
945062764963299330 2017-12-24 22:44:56 UTC <mcpierce> @jaketapper I love how @realDonaldTrump is talked about like he's a three year old who doesn't know he's pooped his pants by @_JasonOsborne int that post... "The POTUS didn't know what it was, he just liked it because it was shiney!"
