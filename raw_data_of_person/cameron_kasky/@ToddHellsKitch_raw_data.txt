949625723748278272 2018-01-06 12:56:30 UTC <ToddHellsKitch> @RCNconnects @profdave @K_Sackas It's the nature of cable. It's cut? There's a cut off of service. That's the simple answer. Here's the more detailed answer : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television?wprov=sfla1
949623245254340608 2018-01-06 12:46:39 UTC <ToddHellsKitch> @RCNconnects @jamieah98 @K_Sackas That's the nature of cable service. It runs along a coaxial cable. If a cable is cut it has to be spliced and reconnected. Arduous. Especially in 5 degrees and no doubt covered in ice from water used on the fire. That's my understanding anyway.
949574523187232769 2018-01-06 09:33:03 UTC <ToddHellsKitch> @RCNconnects Thanks for the updates. Please do continue to keep us posted.
