This is all being done via social media, and the power of teens on social media - to organize, to plan, to mobilize - is nothing to be taken lightly. As far as going to Tallahassee or DC? Parents, crowdfunding...
965663658037592065 2018-02-19 19:05:31 UTC <jazzmom98> Has Trump even met with any of the families, or are school shootings so commonplace now that they dont warrant a presidential visit?

965660994608312320 2018-02-19 18:54:56 UTC <jazzmom98> @moorehn We rely on the media for factual information and for well-informed, thoughtful opinion pieces to help us make election decisions. 2016 was a shitshow. HRC supporters saw what was happening, what youre now admitting, and were furious. The media have much to answer for wrt Trump.

I served so that the rights we all enjoy are protected, especially the First Amendment.  The flag and the anthem are mere symbols of those rights.

Then they go to an ER, where they have to be treated regardless of ability to pay.

If they choose to deny service based on a biblical prohibition, then they must deny adulterers and divorced persons too.  IOW, obvious bigots are obvious.

One need not be credulous to believe either that he said that or that his denial was strategic.

Again with false equivalency - Democrats are not socialists & do not want socialism. However, democracy & aspects of socialism go hand in hand, as Ive noted. Society progresses & prospers thru some collective actions.
937883584496414720 2017-12-04 03:17:26 UTC <jazzmom98> @TheDemocrats @danarubinstein @VerumEstLiberta So is it socialism or communism that the Democrats are all giddy about?

896814096636461056 2017-08-13 19:21:57 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Obama had people attacking him daily. Surprisingly, he never felt the need to demonize them with his own propaganda channel.

873353518643503104 2017-06-09 01:37:59 UTC <jazzmom98> @EricTrump When "we" are out of politics?? As trustees of the Trump businesses, aren't you and your brother supposed to be *out* of politics?
873352122305085441 2017-06-09 01:32:26 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Petty childish clowns in the White House
873271580490465281 2017-06-09 20:12:24 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN "Under oath" As if that means anything to him...
873219895390908416 2017-06-09 16:47:01 UTC <jazzmom98> @nytimes Maybe the more humans you live among, the less humanity you have.
873213134743273472 2017-06-09 16:20:09 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN FFS @realDonaldTrump, was that supposed to make us believe you read reports or care about being informed?? 
873208298702462976 2017-06-09 16:00:56 UTC <jazzmom98> @Amy_Siskind Who is the Rep who voted "no"?
873205654315343872 2017-06-09 15:50:26 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Hmmm...who to believe...serial liar, swindler, tax cheat, con man? Or bi-partisan respected career LE professional? 
872886064569917440 2017-06-08 18:40:29 UTC <jazzmom98> Oh dear lord. https://twitter.com/jakoberlin/status/872869758886174720
872885454512676864 2017-06-08 18:38:04 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN Trump's lies are legion. But I guess they have to try 
872883929564545025 2017-06-08 18:32:00 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Staff must have hidden his phone.
872883636923760641 2017-06-08 18:30:51 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Hahahaha! And he's not a puppet either, right? Hahahaha!
872883152208805891 2017-06-08 18:28:55 UTC <jazzmom98> @LubieWINZ @CNN @RogerMorales305 And they were investigating it; it was an unprecedented situation.

872881463401693184 2017-06-08 18:22:12 UTC <jazzmom98> @DavidCornDC @MJGarciaKCMO I think McCain is a patriot. Maybe his mind just can't process/accept that a sitting Pres can be a traitorous liar. IDK. It's sad, tho.
872880924928626688 2017-06-08 18:20:04 UTC <jazzmom98> Powerful testimony and powerful article. Thank you @DavidCornDC , well done as usual.
872872610974978049 2017-06-08 17:47:02 UTC <jazzmom98> @maddow For some reason, @SenJohnMcCain was the GOP member I had hoped would be a patriot.

872281792870469632 2017-06-06 02:39:20 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @Sailingflyingd The irony is strong with this one.
872275558725369857 2017-06-06 02:14:33 UTC <jazzmom98> @washingtonpost No it's not. But having Trump and his family exposed for the lying, greedy, grifting, self-serving con artists that they are is worth it.
872259307210907649 2017-06-06 01:09:59 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @julie_cappiello So because a deranged murderer was in the military, any former mil appointed/hired by Obama is obviously a bad guy.  Good grief.
872257531543904258 2017-06-06 01:02:55 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @julie_cappiello *moot
872252461372678144 2017-06-06 00:42:47 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @julie_cappiello So bc you hate Obama, you're going to irrationally hate and be suspicious of former military and ppl you know nothing about. Got it.
872245401872617473 2017-06-06 00:14:43 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @julie_cappiello So nice of you to smear them with your knee-jerk Obama hate.
872245258574151681 2017-06-06 00:14:09 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @julie_cappiello Many of the personnel in the Pentagon, undersecretaries etc., are former career military. They are dedicated to serving their country.
872239826715549696 2017-06-06 23:52:34 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @julie_cappiello So you trumpsters are maligning the men & women in our military now?

872224460681601025 2017-06-06 22:51:31 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill That's a badge of honor says the sycophant congressman. More like *dishonor*
872196300745261056 2017-06-06 20:59:37 UTC <jazzmom98> @SenJohnMcCain Only to end up with #TrumpRussia and nazis in the White House. For shame.

871914261026488321 2017-06-05 02:18:53 UTC <jazzmom98> Beyond embarrassed that our so-called Pres shows such a lack of class & decorum as to sling twitter insults at the mayor of a foreign city.

860691842911813632 2017-05-05 03:05:00 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @PPPTCE It was conceived just fine, then GOP jackals hamstrung it.
860586507463081984 2017-05-05 20:06:26 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill You know what's obscene? A so-called Pres who brags of sexual assault and openly mocks the disabled. YMMV
860571200111525888 2017-05-05 19:05:37 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill "I don't stand by anything." On rotation with yours 
860558184288632832 2017-05-05 18:13:54 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNNPolitics @SHSanders45 Lying is not a good look for a Christian. Guess it's ok for a "Christian" though.

860556131717992448 2017-05-05 18:05:44 UTC <jazzmom98> @SenJohnMcCain @CNN And if we don't fight to maintain the integrity of our elections, we're no different than a banana republic! Investigate #TrumpRussia!

860539832493162496 2017-05-05 17:00:58 UTC <jazzmom98> @Stefan24Frei My daughter, whose glove you signed, had a clean sheet that night & her team advances to semis of Presidents Cup @ Starfire
860536110191005696 2017-05-05 16:46:11 UTC <jazzmom98> @Wonkette Why does the wondrous Wonkette not draw much action on the twitter? It's some of the best writing out there - perfect for our current show!
860519801059397632 2017-05-05 15:41:22 UTC <jazzmom98> @ACLU @thehill @BillyJrPatriot @luisbruno No, standing with BofR in defense of Nazis' 1st Amendment right to free speech and assembly, no matter how distasteful their message.
860507255304626176 2017-05-05 14:51:31 UTC <jazzmom98> @realDonaldTrump No, it doesn't. Staying in your house (the WH, btw) or at Camp David, saves us $$. But it's always easier to spend other people's $$, right?
860506153981063168 2017-05-05 14:47:09 UTC <jazzmom98> @DavidCornDC @PhilipRucker Like buying something you don't need just because it's on sale - "But look how much money I saved!"

860380915788259328 2017-05-04 06:29:30 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @ElizabethWade44 IKR?? Unbelievable that he got elected after admitting to grabbing women by the pussy!
860378501823713280 2017-05-04 06:19:54 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN Hey, where are all the FAKENEWS!! people?
860359322957619200 2017-05-04 05:03:41 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill More accurately: Trump supporters ask "What's the point of elections if we can't have everything our way!"
860358831162785794 2017-05-04 05:01:44 UTC <jazzmom98> @colinmochrie @JeffBryanDavis That's ok; Colin is surprisingly strong.

860283330477948928 2017-05-04 00:01:43 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @mjk_4mjk @cbgbmd NBC, actually. But before you squawk FAKENEWS!, you do realize shipments are traceable via customs import records, yes?
860271389000859648 2017-05-04 23:14:16 UTC <jazzmom98> @politico @DonnieVol Hey ding dong , the Clintons made their money after Bill was out of the White House.
860270244002123776 2017-05-04 23:09:43 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @ChicagoFP It shows you have a president who respects religious pandering

860262591704088576 2017-05-04 22:39:19 UTC <jazzmom98> @politico @DonnieVol The many people who are sick of this kleptocrat and his grifting family enriching themselves through his occupation of the White House.
860261569795469312 2017-05-04 22:35:15 UTC <jazzmom98> @politico How convenient for his bank account.

860255357850890240 2017-05-04 22:10:34 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Congress still must answer to their constituents. The Pres and his party leaders propose leg. but then: sausage of compromise.
860254364312547328 2017-05-04 22:06:37 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Jenny has the sadz bc our govt isn't winner takes all, my way or the highway. At least it's not supposed to be. No matter who is in the WH

860214927084077056 2017-05-04 19:29:55 UTC <jazzmom98> @DavidCornDC I hope they choke on it.
860168969679851520 2017-05-04 16:27:18 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Will it still be an honor to meet Kim Jong Un?

859949652904255488 2017-05-03 01:55:49 UTC <jazzmom98> @maddow @thehill is enshrined in the very first amendment in the Bill of Rights. And don't forget the ACLU, those leftists!, are who stands up for 1st Amend.
859949081350725633 2017-05-03 01:53:32 UTC <jazzmom98> @maddow @thehill It's Trump who is trying to marginalized and diminish the free press, which is so important to our nation that what it enables (free speech)
859948698855383040 2017-05-03 01:52:01 UTC <jazzmom98> @maddow @thehill Yet it's Trump who wants to change libel laws bc his feelings get hurt, who is going to jail a woman for daring to laugh at a govt official.
859926174377443329 2017-05-03 00:22:31 UTC <jazzmom98> @AJVicens @MotherJones @Edwin_D_Rios Yet @realDonaldTrump benefited from getting bailed out, multiple times. 
859925674689142784 2017-05-03 00:20:32 UTC <jazzmom98> @MotherJones @msjpauly Heartbreaking, the callous indifference & cruelty of the Trump admin. Thank you @SenBobCasey for trying, for doing what US should stand for.

859160749234569216 2017-05-01 21:40:59 UTC <jazzmom98> The thing was, it didnt cost the president anything to have that entertainment.  Dinner and a show, huh? http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/wilbur-ross-commerce-secretary-syria-missile-strike-tax-cuts-1202405269/
859126755298131968 2017-05-01 19:25:54 UTC <jazzmom98> @Danjanison @jriley8832 Perhaps if Trump *had* syntax and could express himself clearly and cogently, this wouldn't be an issue.

859122623497650176 2017-05-01 19:09:29 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill This man clearly does not understand words or how to use them.

859061167720849413 2017-05-01 15:05:17 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @CesarFLimon Doesn't matter. It's still a simpleton's question. He's probably not studied CW at all - thinks it could have just been "negotiated" away. 
858948227562741760 2017-05-01 07:36:30 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @poor_Richard007 How is it meaningless? It informs the reader about the renegotiation process.
858947821164044289 2017-05-01 07:34:53 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @selftestok Sigh...try reading the article. It wasn't "advice." It was literally a list of legal requirements to satisfy in order to negotiate.

858777753436303360 2017-04-30 20:19:06 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @JoeDanMedia @lolzbernie Nope, I read the article.
858761820156305408 2017-04-30 19:15:47 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @SpursCandle Maybe more book learnin' and less shootin'? 
858760156221276160 2017-04-30 19:09:10 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @SpursCandle Resolute is not the same as hyperbolic.
858750492893102080 2017-04-30 18:30:46 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @SpursCandle Good grief, calm down  David & Goliath is an extremely common analogy.
858749326473822208 2017-04-30 18:26:08 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @erasmus65 A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state...
858748760687378432 2017-04-30 18:23:53 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @JoeDanMedia Can you tell me something that is incorrect or inaccurately presented in the article?
858743604142944256 2017-04-30 18:03:24 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Of course he does.
858742658319097856 2017-04-30 17:59:39 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @kenfriend55 Not everyone is ruled by base emotions like Trumpers. Certain flags in returns trigger audits, more complex the return more likely to audit
858738722690314243 2017-04-30 17:44:00 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @DenActivist @Bottom_Creek Uh huh. And who did he fill his cabinet with again?
858738286738546688 2017-04-30 17:42:16 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @bkohatl Critical thinking make you sleepy? Better go take a nap so you don't get cranky!
858737826384326656 2017-04-30 17:40:27 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @HyperAlerts Don't try to argue with #TrumpLogic Jon

858734385431957504 2017-04-30 17:26:46 UTC <jazzmom98> @TrueFactsStated He should be indicted under Foreign Corrupt Practices Act too. The hotel in Azerbaijan reeks of payola & laundering http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/donald-trumps-worst-deal
858732252750004225 2017-04-30 17:18:18 UTC <jazzmom98> @POTUS @PattyMurray @JulieBursic So important that we'll just let States decide civil rights & protections? Americans moving from state to state must play roulette w/rights?
858730668963934208 2017-04-30 17:12:00 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Make them apply retroactively to all your birther bullshit and other lies @realDonaldTrump!
858729475650891780 2017-04-30 17:07:16 UTC <jazzmom98> @PattyMurray @62jerseygirl Bullying, violence, anxiety...
858729060343480320 2017-04-30 17:05:37 UTC <jazzmom98> @POTUS @PattyMurray @JulieBursic You seem to have forgotten the rollback of trans student protections and support of gay conversion by Pence & DeVos. Convenient omission?
858727260089573376 2017-04-30 16:58:27 UTC <jazzmom98> @PattyMurray Thank you Senator but please DO NOT let up on #Trumprussia!

858599803780972545 2017-04-30 08:31:59 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Yes, Trump with his gilded lifestyle is such a man of the people. 
858598486186483714 2017-04-30 08:26:45 UTC <jazzmom98> @AngelsRBlessing but that kind of inspiration and motivation is ominous.
858598239708225536 2017-04-30 08:25:46 UTC <jazzmom98> @AngelsRBlessing That's true. Husband's cousin (58 yo) proudly posted on FB that she voted for the first time - for Trump. Shame on her for never voting,
858591185790578688 2017-04-30 07:57:45 UTC <jazzmom98> @cameronesposito @MarioV7 @buvox There's a long history of quid pro quo for speeches? Do you have some concrete examples of that?
858587696070967299 2017-04-30 07:43:53 UTC <jazzmom98> @edbott @cameronesposito @chartier @jeuler I think Larry is actually just playing that persona. Caribou Barbie on the other hand...
858489076932005890 2017-04-29 01:12:00 UTC <jazzmom98> @WSJ @GingerFritzie @lcdollarjr That claim is so substance free it is sucking matter out of the universe. Seriously, how far up your ass did you have to reach for that??
858488505088987136 2017-04-29 01:09:44 UTC <jazzmom98> @WSJ @lcdollarjr @GingerFritzie Sounders fan here. Good luck to MNUFC - good to see the league growing!
858487946810281984 2017-04-29 01:07:31 UTC <jazzmom98> @WSJ @selftestok IDK, seems to me that they are ready to rationalize any failure or aberration as either fake news or someone else's fault. 
858486836775141376 2017-04-29 01:03:06 UTC <jazzmom98> @cnnbrk So? How is that at all an important metric?

858483208127528961 2017-04-29 00:48:41 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @kruse_dirk I do love German engineering! First car was Audi 100 . Also have had VW and BMW. All great cars, but...would kill for a Tesla!
858480828002652160 2017-04-29 00:39:13 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @EWick33 @Krunchies_ It's Ghostrider, and if you want everything made in the US, you damn sure better be prepared to pay a lot more!
858479764226490368 2017-04-29 00:35:00 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @MacanSharp Right, Dem presidents always gave to clean up after the GOP blows up the economy.

858458415437291520 2017-04-29 23:10:10 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @alphanewlife 1) That's not how hashtags work 2) How can video clips of POTUS be fake news? 3) Use Dr or PhD, not both, per academia etiquette.

858453154156879872 2017-04-29 22:49:15 UTC <jazzmom98> @BernieSanders @dergrexxie @cmclymer Can we please stop with the speech outrage? Good god who cares?? People want to hear a big celeb talk, they pay big money. Supply/demand!

858440740510117888 2017-04-29 21:59:56 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Why does this man have such a pathetic need to have his ego stroked?? That makes him easily manipulated. #nopuppet?

858364451795288064 2017-04-29 16:56:47 UTC <jazzmom98> This administration is just plain evil. Controlling info to the public? Dic(tator) move.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/858299987993800705
858361584699047936 2017-04-29 16:45:24 UTC <jazzmom98> @DavidCornDC It's also an insult to those who have seen a psychiatrist. He's implying that it's a weakness or deficiency somehow.

858193775222415360 2017-04-28 05:38:35 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill IOW...Aimed at the freedom to be an asshat.

858092059650998272 2017-04-28 22:54:24 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill It was only a matter of time, really. Clarke is a perfect fit for Trump. He can go down with the ship too.
858091277790855172 2017-04-28 22:51:17 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @StrangeShadows Nice! "I've siphoned the most tax dollars into my businesses in the #First100Days, that I can tell you." 
858090251402723328 2017-04-28 22:47:13 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Of course he does. He's special that way.
858089248704020481 2017-04-28 22:43:14 UTC <jazzmom98> @Salon @StrangeShadows They're drooling at the thought of nuking NK into a radioactive crater. That's practically verbatim. 
858088617121521664 2017-04-28 22:40:43 UTC <jazzmom98> @Salon So Trump cultists approve of treason. That's...a new low. But everything about this president is a new low, so why not approve of treason 
858083458811183104 2017-04-28 22:20:13 UTC <jazzmom98> @DavidCornDC @pggntfn @DavidAames23001 They relish the "anti/pc" vitriol. It's so tiring being decent and civil after all.
858083011719421952 2017-04-28 22:18:27 UTC <jazzmom98> @DavidCornDC Good god, what a petty, uncouth boor! Can we possibly get one shred of maturity? One ounce of decorum? Is that asking too much??
858035460945440768 2017-04-28 19:09:30 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @TrishAnderson32 Or maybe, just maybe, being POTUS is a teensy bit harder than "negotiating" deals, running frauds, and hiring lawyers to sue people 
858033631826239492 2017-04-28 19:02:13 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Feel free to quit.
857866253909630977 2017-04-28 07:57:07 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @SmithBrand @mjhilboldt Plenty? What's "plenty"? That doesn't jibe with the NRA's no restrictions/more the merrier message.
857863601599553538 2017-04-28 07:46:35 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @GuardinoScott Meh, not so bigly. So, you're saying that once election is over, opposition party must roll over & play dead? Not how this works at all.
857862109987692544 2017-04-28 07:40:39 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @russbwald be safer if the convention goers are all armed. If he's not safer with more guns, then why does the NRA push that fallacy?
857861636220084224 2017-04-28 07:38:47 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @russbwald NRA says guns make us safer, that more ppl carrying is better. *If* that is true, then the logical inference is that the Pres will
857859780982972416 2017-04-28 07:31:24 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @GuardinoScott Yeah, sorry but not so much with the mandate thing when you lose the popular vote by such a bigly amount.
857858934400466944 2017-04-28 07:28:02 UTC <jazzmom98> @washingtonpost @alsosusieq2 Ah yes, that sounds familiar! I used to read all things equine as a young girl. 
857858562919251968 2017-04-28 07:26:34 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @josh_belden Depends on if the bear is Russian, eh? Maybe no-one will!
857858288230072320 2017-04-28 07:25:28 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @Jakesnewsfeed @chess3558 But ppl next to the shooter shouldn't have to wait for the police or SS to respond! Get killed waiting for the police to arrive?? No way!
857856969528430592 2017-04-28 07:20:14 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @SmithBrand @mjhilboldt But...we've been told that good guys with guns will stop a bad guy with an agenda (and a gun). Is that not the case?
857855646204428288 2017-04-28 07:14:58 UTC <jazzmom98> @politico @big_griffsfunny To not be able to get anything passed, especially when the president's party controls Congress, is abjectly poor leadership.
857855108066885633 2017-04-28 07:12:50 UTC <jazzmom98> @politico @big_griffsfunny Because a Pres sets an agenda and works with Congress to get legislation passed that furthers the agenda. Leads, negotiates, compromises.
857854195004616704 2017-04-28 07:09:12 UTC <jazzmom98> @politico @buecher_h But she had emails!! And speeches!!!

857831185107501056 2017-04-27 05:37:46 UTC <jazzmom98> @politico @MyPlace4U @MsAccountabilit So you don't believe that 93% of Trump's voters still support him?
857828820375568384 2017-04-27 05:28:23 UTC <jazzmom98> @politico @Oregonkato13 The polls accurately reflected the national (aka popular) vote. Which is what they were intended to gauge.

857777410091106304 2017-04-27 02:04:05 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @ntmessage Fake news? So you're saying people are not calling the hotline with tongue-in-cheek tips?
857775641143279616 2017-04-27 01:57:04 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Thanks media, for fawning over the Syrian missiles.   Oh and...Russia? What Russia? LOOK AT NORTH KOREA!!!
857769709491453952 2017-04-27 01:33:29 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @GuardinoScott But it is respecting the will of the people who they represent. That's what you do in a representative democracy.
857763516798783488 2017-04-27 01:08:53 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @GuardinoScott "Obstruction is not deprecating the will of the people"? I know twitter is an imperfect medium for precise expression, but...wtf??

857745322419683328 2017-04-27 23:56:35 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @aplynwood So their No. 1 reason for pushing for guns everywhere -that more guns = increased safety - is not, in fact, true? Whoa.
857743914245046272 2017-04-27 23:50:59 UTC <jazzmom98> @POTUS @CNN @bigredwall So? It's their goddamn 2nd Amendment right to carry! Everywhere! How else will bad guys be stopped??

855864399239589888 2017-04-22 19:22:28 UTC <jazzmom98> @BresPolitico @SpankYouSilly @realJeffreyLord Issue wasn't if Trump has (token) POC -Carson only, Thomas already in place - but from whom he seeks counsel. Not Carson or Thomas.
855861731444178945 2017-04-22 19:11:52 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN Sigh...don't we each have enough weaponry to annihilate everyone on earth already?

855191492951814144 2017-04-20 22:48:35 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @storyseen @jpnairn @politicangst Trump is a vile, loathsome, grifting, treasonous pig. Why would I be happy with him?
855186616545050625 2017-04-20 22:29:12 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill White trash in the White House. 
855161783765524481 2017-04-20 20:50:32 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @storyseen @politicangst @jpnairn My priorities = protect environment, civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQ, separation of church/state, etc., but whatever.
855125198315503616 2017-04-20 18:25:09 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @storyseen @politicangst @jpnairn Oh there it is: the false equivalence, lesser evil bullshit. Have fun riding that purity pony with Trump and the truly evil GOP agenda.
855087932322889728 2017-04-20 15:57:04 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @jpnairn @storyseen @politicangst But what isn't there *is* the problem! By not expressing support instead of loaded "I don't know" BS implied "Ossof? Meh".
855085688416423937 2017-04-20 15:48:09 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @TheBayAreaBuzz Much better to say "I don't know BUT he's the best choice for Georgia's voters." The idea is to flip GA06 blue, right? Show support!
855083592988237824 2017-04-20 15:39:49 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @telenews_us Ossof is a democrat running against regressive, Trump enabling GOP. I TRUST him to help flip Congress. Sanders' support would help.
855082403211100160 2017-04-20 15:35:06 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @storyseen @politicangst @jpnairn Is there a candidate to the left of Ossof running against regressive, Trump enabling GOP in GA06? No? Then support the Democrat!
855081047758749696 2017-04-20 15:29:43 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill Is there a Dem left of Ossof running in the GA06? Unless Sndrs is ok with GOP destroying envrnmnt, civil rights, econ he should fully supprt
854969135834341376 2017-04-20 08:05:01 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @politicangst Considering how many fervent followers Sanders has, his words carry much weight. He should use them more carefully.
854968512514674688 2017-04-20 08:02:32 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @politicangst Comes across as dissembling and being coy. Why not just say,"Whether he is prog or not, Ossof is the best choice for GA's 6th district"?
854960635431370752 2017-04-20 07:31:14 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @politicangst Ossof needs all the help he can get to beat regressive GOP and flip GA06. In *that* context, Sanders should be supportive or be quiet.
854953584156262400 2017-04-20 07:03:13 UTC <jazzmom98> @politico Still thinking he's the CEO-in-Chief with bankers' hours and 3 day golf weekends. #griftersgonnagrift

854873287813246977 2017-04-19 01:44:09 UTC <jazzmom98> @noamscheiber "They wonder why he's silent." I hope at some point they realize they were used.
854873010368421888 2017-04-19 01:43:03 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill That's malicious mischief, at best.
854853937114955781 2017-04-19 00:27:15 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @theCenterView How is CNN "making it anti-Trump"? The story is literally nothing but factual statements.

854579290901331969 2017-04-18 06:15:54 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @skidmarkymarkk Coal drop came about in 2016 when Obama urged Xi to comply with UNSC sanctions. Chinese banks still facilitate NK weapons programs.
854527583303512064 2017-04-18 02:50:26 UTC <jazzmom98> @CNN @skidmarkymarkk What's been reeled in so far? Besides Trump's rhetoric on currency manipulation?
854524083156860928 2017-04-18 02:36:32 UTC <jazzmom98> @thehill @Ladyred133 Yawn. Social Democrat actually, which is not communism.Please read and learn something. Also, the phrase is one *and* the same.

853423484617146368 2017-04-15 01:43:09 UTC <jazzmom98> @freedomride57 How have the *minority* dems prevented any appointments? They don't have the votes for that. Maybe Donnie should stay in DC and do his job.
