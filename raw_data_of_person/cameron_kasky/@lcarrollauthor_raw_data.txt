849004202839998465 2017-04-03 21:02:30 UTC <lcarrollauthor> One reason I suspect this acct; frequent unfamiliarity with Eng. grammar. Sloppy typing? Or something else?https://twitter.com/RoguePOTUSStaff/status/848332887703400448
847247638386757638 2017-03-29 00:42:32 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc Hypocrisy. They are so quick to judge others (and try to legislate it) for THEIR lifestyles!

844029096753479680 2017-03-20 03:33:12 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc I have wondered if there is a South Asian IT person there. Someone we don't know about; but DJT doesn't like brown ppl, so...
844028772793778176 2017-03-20 03:31:55 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc The acct also insulted Ivanka: "a bitch IRL", so not on that team. Or deflecting attn from that direction.
844028511559933952 2017-03-20 03:30:53 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc I also think there is lots of intentional deflection going on. A mistake to take it all literally.
844028139755847680 2017-03-20 03:29:24 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc Watch who gets insulted and who is let off the hook.
844027951091867648 2017-03-20 03:28:39 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc I think they are just sloppy. Maybe speaking into phone & using voice recognition software, which is notoriously lousy.
844027787438514176 2017-03-20 03:28:00 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc They claim it's more than 1 person using acct.
844027704584232960 2017-03-20 03:27:40 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc spelled "vakay" instead of "vacay." But would have said "holiday" if British.
844026561372348416 2017-03-20 03:23:08 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc Tone is bitchy & defensive. My money is on Spicer, who frequently mangles English grammar.
844026182899253249 2017-03-20 03:21:37 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc Gorka is v. polished. Evil, but v. polished.
844026018147061760 2017-03-20 03:20:58 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc I wonder if it isn't just run of the mill poorly educated GOP. Dems rarely misspell. Viz: no misspelled signs @ women's march!
844025659412353025 2017-03-20 03:19:33 UTC <lcarrollauthor> @DeAnnSmithkc there are an awful lot of misspellings and strange grammar. He speaks better English actually.
