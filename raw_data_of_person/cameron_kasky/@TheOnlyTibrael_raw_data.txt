971461759042191361 2018-03-07 19:05:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @nowthisnews @ItZmeKatherine Honestly.... I've been around the block when it comes to addiction... sugar, IMHO, is the MOST addictive substance on the planet. It's the strongest withdrawal and most intense cravings I have ever experienced.
971461015383826433 2018-03-07 19:02:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Identivezk Hey, you might want to activate Windows.

971440028386816000 2018-03-07 17:38:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @MazzyK @OlanMcGowan @GigiEngle Sexism against men does exist, though it is not nearly as prevalent against men as it is women.  Men are not allowed to express emotions, for one simple example.
971428783638106113 2018-03-07 16:54:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Here I am a 36 year old adult and I was just reminded by a Parkland H.S. student to double check my voter registration.  My count in TN still had me registered under my old address even though I changed my address at the post off a year ago.  Thanks for this @davidhogg111!!https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/971065326820560897
971427566325305344 2018-03-07 16:49:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @nikta04 @davidhogg111 I'm REALLY glad that you posted this.  I am a 36 year old adult who moved at the beginning of last year and registered my new address to vote shortly after I moved.  I double checked today and my registration was NOT updated.  Thanks for this!  I fixed it.  :)

969257026831437824 2018-03-01 17:04:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate It really isn't... this should not hold up in the Supreme Court.
969256597695365120 2018-03-01 17:02:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate Just a little background info:  Kroger did the opposite of Wal-Mart in creating a "superstore" chain by adding non-grocery inventory.  This included TONS of retail items.  Apparently in this location, it also included guns.
969027849683394560 2018-02-28 01:53:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheRalphRetort @AMC0102 @momofmonday Funny, we're conversing on @TheCaptainAidan's page.  @williamlegate compiled a list of every student account he could find.  Also, @Emma4Change helped to create this movement.  It was her speech that helped the movement gain momentum nationwide.
969027412582387713 2018-02-28 01:51:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eugenegu This has been my argument since the beginning of this argument.  "Let's arm all the teachers."  "Good idea, less students to feed with free lunches!"  *SMDH*
968941157668544515 2018-02-28 20:09:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @faccccct Not if it is full of sugar.  You want to enter Ketosis which allows your body to burn fat instead of sugar.  This can only be done by getting sugar out of your foods.

968884343123927040 2018-02-28 16:23:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ILMFOrg Funny that this is only being posted on known GOP propaganda sites.  Even if it's true, 1 person does not represent the 800k DACA recipients.  I don't believe this is true, regardless.  Anything coming from Infowars is just chemicals turning the frogs gay.
968883571254550529 2018-02-28 16:20:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheCaptainAidan Maybe, maybe not.  Focusing on a "what-if" scenario does not change what happened.
968882685853741058 2018-02-28 16:16:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheCaptainAidan I don't think you understand what boycotting the NRA means.  They are the one's who are keeping the weapons used to kill your classmates perfectly legal.  They are the one's fighting sensible gun laws.  This can be prevented.
968882329195249664 2018-02-28 16:15:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheCaptainAidan Don't fall for the propaganda, Aidan.  Ellen is a good person.  There are a lot of people on your side from the blue side.  Don't fall into the GOP conspiracy pit of despair.  Those people are not on you side.

965292030409822209 2018-02-18 18:28:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @funder Yeah.  Jill Stein is definitely not one of my favorite people, right now.
965261044825411585 2018-02-18 16:25:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dennis_Kucinich @FoxNews @chrislynne You add the DNC being hacked showing proof that they screwed Bernie and Trump's Russian collusion with those hackers, then you will see the full picture.

965144176768765952 2018-02-18 08:41:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @troutish @longlivekcx I would focus your anger more at the politicians that have refused to enact common sense gun laws.  The FBI made a mistake, yes, but they should not be demonized for this.

965088639591112705 2018-02-17 05:00:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Nailed it, as always @williamlegate.
965069148303880192 2018-02-17 03:43:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @mj_lee Trauma can do that, make one grow up suddenly and quickly.
965066533629317120 2018-02-17 03:32:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @twhown I'm just saying, this is a slippery slope than can lead to major discrimination within the law.  And, again, I am for common sense gun legislation.  Cruz was already on the FBIs radar which should have been enough to stop him from obtaining an AR-15, for a time at least.
965065412445696000 2018-02-17 03:28:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @twhown What I do not support is taking firearms away from citizens with none of the above because they have past trauma.  Everyone can be given a diagnosis at some point in their lives.
965065137219567618 2018-02-17 03:27:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @twhown I am all for gun reform, but I am not for discrimination.  If someone has a history of violence, has been committed to a mental institution, or has a good reason to be court ordered to give up their firearms, then I support their loss of this constitutional right.
965060756306841600 2018-02-17 03:09:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @twhown It is a very slippery slope, that kind of discrimination.  I do think if somebody is antisocial then perhaps we should avoid giving them weapons, but that gets into personality disorders, not mental disorders.
965060403838451712 2018-02-17 03:08:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @twhown While that is the case, even Obama's provisions for mental health in background checks included only those who were court ordered or committed against their will to give up their rights to firearms.  Saying that I cannot own a firearm because of past trauma is discriminatory.
965034381151752192 2018-02-17 01:25:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @jca10c9 I know quite a bit about the DSM, thanks.  Why are you doing this?  This is how it works in TN.  I have been diagnosed by a legal professional in my state.  Why are you arguing that?

I voted for Hillary in the general election. I do not have a go-fund-me, I work for my money. I have also been diagnosed by licensed professionals. We are on the same side, so why attack me? That's abusive.

965031164426809344 2018-02-17 01:12:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @jca10c9 I have been diagnosed by both, thanks.
965031054049456129 2018-02-17 01:11:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @jca10c9 A PhD in psychology is a psychiatrist and a therapist can absolutely make a diagnosis.  You obviously know nothing about the diagnostic process, at all.
965030600343195649 2018-02-17 01:09:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @JohannaDeVere Why?  Please explain.  I am for common sense gun laws, btw.  I am also not suicidal or homicidal nor have I ever been committed or in legal trouble.
965030208091848704 2018-02-17 01:08:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @Grammalamb I feel this is exactly what it means to embrace responsible and common sense fun ownership.  Thanks for this.
965029927425855488 2018-02-17 01:07:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @JustGAPeachy523 @jca10c9 I was diagnosed separately by an LCSW and PhD in psychology. Calling my argument stupid is dismissive. Obama's restrictions on mental illness would not include me. It includes people who have been committed against their will or court ordered not to own firearms. #EducateYourself
965029142315102209 2018-02-17 01:04:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @jca10c9 I have PTSD from family trauma.  You do not get to decide this, my therapist does.  Also, I am a responsible fun owner who believes in closing the private sale loophole, licensure, and registration of all firearms.
965028760411082753 2018-02-17 01:02:40 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @Grammalamb My mental illness is very much controlled. It is a manageable anxiety dysfunction. I am not a sociopath and what you are suggesting is discrimination, honestly. I have never been committed to a mental institution. I am have never been in trouble with the law. Slippery slope, that
964977920119799808 2018-02-17 21:40:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheLoveBel0w Wow.  That guy jumped to conclusions REAL fast.  "So, because white supremacy is bad... Antifa is good?"  I mean, moreso... yes, but that was completely beyond the point.
964973822280720384 2018-02-17 21:24:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen I have PTSD.  Are you suggesting I should not own a firearm?  Even though I have never had a history of violence or violent crime?
964969306000887809 2018-02-17 21:06:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @robjective @SLSmith000 I disagree.  They definitely should end the echo chamber algorithms, though.
964920970506096640 2018-02-17 17:54:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @txsttpusa Actually, capitalism is destroying the planet.  Thanks for the propaganda.

964655073690308608 2018-02-16 00:17:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @sarahchad_ I have said it before and I will keep saying it:  Giving teachers guns in the classroom will inevitably lead to a teacher flying off the handle and killing a classroom full of children.  It's only a matter of time before somebody loses it.  This is not a good idea.
964653048231493632 2018-02-16 00:09:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @sarahchad_ Also, the moment you have teachers carrying guns into the classroom, it's only a matter of time until one of them ends up killing an entire classroom of schoolchildren.  This is not a good idea, at all.
964569053015826432 2018-02-16 18:35:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheSWPrincess @Grammitude55 The AR-15 is a semi-automatic rifle.  It's really hard, nearly impossible really, to buy automatic assault rifles this day and age.
964550530747060224 2018-02-16 17:22:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @krassenstein I keep saying, on repeat, that if we arm our teachers... then one of them will fly off the handle and end up killing an entire classroom of our children.

964352144412471296 2018-02-15 04:14:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KLemkau To be perfectly honest with you, I want to own one.  As a proponent for stricter gun laws, I believe in more thorough background checks, licensure and registration, and possibly even insurance on these weapons in case of accidents.  We have to do something to stop the violence.

964346980603396096 2018-02-15 03:53:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @longlivekcx It will get easier.  Trauma is no joke, though.  You should ask your parents to find you a good therapist.  I have PTSD and it is invuluable to find a professional that will listen to you and that you can mesh with pretty well.
964346684334596096 2018-02-15 03:52:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eugenegu Thanks for this.  I watched a video taken by one of the kids at the school a couple of hours ago.  You could hear the shots, very loudly.  Some kid was lying on the ground.  First time in months I've actually cried over a shooting.  :/
964342035527368704 2018-02-15 03:33:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @LOLGOP @zackbeauchamp @rants_n_whatevs @youthinkyoudo11 @akobilarov @3rdTimeUnder What does this even mean? And why are you attacking the man and not the argument?  This is officially an ad hominem attack, a logical fallicy that completely invalidates your argument.  Also, discriminating against muslims for their faith is called bigotry.
964339755935846400 2018-02-15 03:24:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @WSJopinion @JRubinBlogger Right?  There was literally an armed security guard in the building who was unable to come face to face with the shooter.  The WSJ has lost me on this one.

964228167954288640 2018-02-15 20:01:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @krassenstein So, I have PTSD.  Does that mean I should not be allowed to buy a weapon?  That's pretty intense.

964189399452995590 2018-02-15 17:27:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> I am so ridiculously tired of making the same arguments whenever see see a mass shooting like the one in Florida.  Every. Single. Time.  It's always the same arguments with absolutely 0 action taken by our government leaders  It's sickening.
964189313100582913 2018-02-15 17:27:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RobertwRuncie @browardschools @FoxNews @williamlegate @chriscford So... what do you want to do, militarize our schools?  Set up fences, walls, barriers, guard towers, swat teams?  That is not a fiscally conservaitve answer, it's very expensive and illogical.  It's much easier to close background check loopholes and require licensure/insurance.
964187362120159234 2018-02-15 17:19:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @cmclymer In Sweden, the average citizen can own military grade weapons because they are all military trained, but the weapons and ammo MUST say under lock and key.  They have one of the lowest gun crime rates in the world.
964186448810389504 2018-02-15 17:15:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RobertwRuncie @browardschools @FoxNews @LibBusters76 @kimba060764 This is not a responsible argument.  Seriously.  You are going to create a system where a teacher is going to lose it and kill an entire classroom of children.  Think about it.
964186197399670784 2018-02-15 17:14:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RobertwRuncie @browardschools @FoxNews @gwoodard41 @socalcctv @20thCentureeBoy I was about to say the same damned thing.
964186020714631174 2018-02-15 17:13:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RobertwRuncie @browardschools @FoxNews @Megahawk15 Close the private sale background check loophole.  This is a bullshit excuse.
964185087616212992 2018-02-15 17:10:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RobertwRuncie @browardschools @FoxNews @williamlegate @chriscford They literally had armed guards, they never ran into the shooter.  You cannot fight this fucking chaos without sensible gun reform.
964180438012039169 2018-02-15 16:51:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AP it's pretty simple really:  Close the private sale loophole then require licensure and registration for all firearms and owership.  That's a huge step in the right direction.  Mental illness is not the only factor and is a slipperly slope toward discrimination in ownership.
964179170661150721 2018-02-15 16:46:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @longlivekcx I am soooo sorry for your loss.  This is senseless and many of us want to do everything we can to prevent this from ever happening again.  I know it's hard right now, but it will get easier.  Keep your head up.
964177133466726405 2018-02-15 16:38:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Well, this kind of destroys the "good guy with a gun" argument.https://twitter.com/AP/status/964171829270188032
964175864924721153 2018-02-15 16:33:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CollegeHumor @williamlegate Nevermind, this was your retweet.  
964175218582450176 2018-02-15 16:31:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CollegeHumor @williamlegate I think you will enjoy this.  It's exactly what you were talking about this morning.
964161155089551362 2018-02-15 15:35:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate Victim blaming is a pretty common theme.  We see it a lot with sexual assault and molestation victims.  People will use any excuse to deny an inconvenient truth.
964159346375610368 2018-02-15 15:27:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheLoveBel0w @instagoogltwtfc @williamlegate @spencer_derek You left Tennessee off the list.  We have no background checks for private sales.  Also, pretty sure Texas is the same.
964158555640287232 2018-02-15 15:24:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BleedingRedDan I feel that the problem is much more complex than dealing with these two absolutes.  If you are only lumping our problems into "evil" or "guns" then you really are not looking at the problem, at all.  Thanks for perpetuating the issues by avoiding the issues.  @williamlegate
964156703804657669 2018-02-15 15:17:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @cmclymer The moment we arm our teachers, one of them is going to lose it and kill an entire classroom.  How about we focus on our men's mental health created by the stresses of late stage capitallism?  Also, Feminism is a HUGE answer to these issues of fragile masculinity.
964156177671180288 2018-02-15 15:15:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @OhNoSheTwitnt Just one problem with that... we are all creating online echo chambers and are not hearing ANY argument's from the other side.  Twitter, Facebook, and Google already have their algorythims setup to do this, and what you are suggesting will only further perpetuate this.
964155438337003520 2018-02-15 15:12:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate  Your perspective is always far beyond your years.  I always appreciate what you have to say.  Thanks for sharing this opinion about the 2nd amendment, I feel it is spot on.
964044242061537280 2018-02-14 07:50:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kevin_patrick @DailyChef7 @Guinz @Blood52 The Constitution was written by revolutionaries who wanted the people to have access to much of the same weaponry as the government. Also, most weapons are semi-automatic now, like the AR-15. Military grade weapons have firing options, meaning semi, burst, and full-auto.
964036491776229376 2018-02-14 07:19:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate it's bad... I am so desensitized that this earned 0 emotional reaction from me...  I hate it.
963993754142216192 2018-02-14 04:29:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @cmclymer @DJDJ18 That's a great point.
963993355737759746 2018-02-14 04:28:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @krassenstein I don't believe that information has been released yet, has it?
963959419775193088 2018-02-14 02:13:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @cmclymer You cannot twist facts like this, though.  Most mass shootings, including school shootings, use 9mm handguns or bushmaster rifles.  AR-15s are very rarely used, and bump stocks have only been used in maybe 1 shooting, that being Las Vegas.
963945859565187073 2018-02-14 01:19:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ninaandtito @grantstern Funny that this business shut it's doors shortly after he became president the Special Council Mueller was appointed.  I didn't think about this fact until I saw the retweet of this article.
963945364654092289 2018-02-14 01:17:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Jonnynono I got into a long, drawn-out argument about victim blaming and how the first victim should be listened to.  Now we have a 2nd victim coming forward.  This speaks VOLUMES.

963900406446350336 2018-02-14 22:18:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SpeakerRyan @IronStache That's because the GOP wants the TRILLIONS of dollars that have been saved toward our combined social security retirement fund.  It's despicable.

963896438685126661 2018-02-14 22:03:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SenBobCorker How about fixing the private sale loophole, requiring licensure and registration, and getting off your ass to try and fix the problem, Bob?  You CANNOT keep giving the same BULLSHIT response!!!  We The People are FURIOUS with you!!

963872725197578240 2018-02-14 20:29:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @cmclymer I am all for legal firearm ownership, as long as the above problems are fixed and some sort of license and registration is put into place.  Also, CLOSE THE PRIVATE SALE BACKGROUND CHECK LOOPHOLE!!!  How many children have to die before the GOP acknowledges this problem!?

There was even a movie made about his racism stopping him from being appointed to the supreme court.  It doesn't matter what it means legally, when you hear Jeff sessions saying.
963396618262319104 2018-02-13 12:57:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @ann_mandeville Does it matter?  This man just said "Anglo-American Heritage of law enforcement."  Think about that.  This man is openly a white-supremacist.
963249043953672192 2018-02-12 03:10:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle Yeah.  That's as far as I made it, too.  Though, everyone talking about it makes me sort of curious at this point.

962485391973670912 2018-02-10 00:36:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate Wait.... You're suggestiong the GOP and Evangelical base is actually liken to a cult?  That's pretty brilliant of you, Mr. LeGate.  Thanks for pointing this out.
962485012904992768 2018-02-10 00:34:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @RoccoP79 @rgcainmd @hayleyrebecca @Comfynumb15 @21CentJeff @joeycadre @decakarjeffrey LOL.  This is kind of hilarious.  The terms "soyboy" and "Beta male" crack me up. Is your masculinity so fragile that when someone stands up for women, or femininity in ANY fashion, it is suddenly threatened?  That, to me, is fragile masculinity, and Alpha males are fragile.
962479996601294848 2018-02-10 00:14:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenKing I'm so glad you are one of the good guys.

962426378837782533 2018-02-10 20:41:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle LOL.

962425780725743616 2018-02-10 20:39:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SugarCunt @kxyonn @Qrytczyrofsyn It's okay, man.  Just go watch the documentary and educate yourself.  The FBI and Federal Government of the US created a smear campaign against the Black Panther Party.  It's intense.  They even assassinated one of their main members.  The proof comes from FBI documentation.

962050885613273090 2018-02-09 19:49:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SugarCunt @kxyonn @Qrytczyrofsyn The Black Panther movement was about black equality and rising up out of poverty.  Go watch the PBS documentary about them on Netflix.  They were, in essense, a peaceful movement that armed themselves for good reason.
962050575675215872 2018-02-09 19:48:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kxyonn My half Jewish girlfriend and my white ass are both hyped about Black Panther!!  I love the usage of black music, particularly from the era of the Black Panther political movement, being used in the trailers.  "The Revolution will not be televised!"  Hyped for representation!

960647438397792256 2018-02-05 22:52:51 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TalbertSwan @joy31608 @pam_lethco In fact, Africans would not have sold anyone into slavery (again, an very small percentage did this) if it had not been for systemic slavery in America (again, perpetuated by rich whites) and other places perpetuating the ownership of slaves.
960647022671024128 2018-02-05 22:51:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TalbertSwan @joy31608 @pam_lethco I never said that, not once.The Majority of the systemic American slavery was perpetuate by white Europeans.Egyptians did have slaves, but we are talking within the past 200 years and not what went on in Egypt 2000 years ago.Africans selling Africans was a very small percentage.

960536680494256129 2018-02-05 15:32:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TalbertSwan @joy31608 @pam_lethco They did, as far as American slavery is concerned.  The Dutch owned the slave trade, or the majority of it.  White men owned the vast majority of slaves, as well.  Rich white men, to be exact.  This is historical fact.

960531356014039041 2018-02-05 15:11:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SarahKSilverman Sarah, this is Huckabee twisting the truth to fit a narrative believed by Evangelical voters.  He knows he is twisting the facts.  All he cares about are the votes.
960526940062081024 2018-02-05 14:54:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TalbertSwan @joy31608 @pam_lethco It's a generalization.  And it's a correct generalization.  Sociology can prove white privilege.  We are the dominant group.  The dominant group gets all the privilege.
960407504650895360 2018-02-04 06:59:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TalbertSwan @Mrswaddlesworth Put it into context.  We are talking about institutionalized slavery in the United States.
960406777505435648 2018-02-04 06:56:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TalbertSwan @joy31608 @pam_lethco Today's white people do not directly own slaves, but that does not mean the system is suddenly equal.  White people have it easy in comparison.  Racism is still systemically pathological.

Yes, it was rushed. Yes, the creator is inexperienced. Yes, it has bugs. Complaining about it just makes you look bad, and that sucks... Because it disappoints your fans.
959309170120966144 2018-02-01 06:15:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TylerPreston20 You do not get to decide that this is not insulting unless you are a part of the minority that it is directly insulting.

958767574229114881 2018-01-31 18:22:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CREWcrew @SaysHummingbird @lister_lester Bernie did not have to release his tax returns, he is not the president. Bernie was successfully vetted by the media. Bernie explained exactly what he planned to do and how to pay for it. Bernie had a great foreign policy.
958746086205722628 2018-01-31 16:57:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FractalJosh @Real_Feelster LoL.  If it dies.  We talked pretty huge right now.
958711655172661248 2018-01-31 14:40:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JordanUhl I wonder if he is also taking credit for these rising gas prices???

958711287386689538 2018-01-31 14:39:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FractalJosh Man, I want a 1080 or 1080 ti so badly right now.  About to get school money and a tax return, but I cannot justify paying nearly double for what is out there.  Sad that miners have driven up the prices so drastically.  I just want to game and do some photo editing for school.

958183573730807809 2018-01-29 03:42:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @rabiasquared Yes, absolutely.  This is targeted harassment.
958130322616528896 2018-01-29 00:10:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle You're 100% right.  I feel like every white supremacist in the country just took a break to clean up the mess in their shorts.

958038541782736901 2018-01-29 18:06:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @washingtonpost What they meant to say was the media's trump covers is "anti-authoritarian."
958038396106166277 2018-01-29 18:05:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> This is so beyond me, at first I thought it was Sci-Fi.  Well played, @danharmon.
958037887089565699 2018-01-29 18:03:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @AgathaC80 @Doug_Bratman I have read what she said. I will also reiterate: less than 9% of all rape and sexual abuse reports are fake. 85%, maybe more, of all sexual abuse against women goes unreported to the authorities. Not listening to the victim has become pathology in the USA. This is why I listen.
958037412055306240 2018-01-29 18:01:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BrandSanderson I just wanted to say... I feel that you NAILED the ending of the Wheel of Time.  I was a little worried at first, but A Memory of Light was absolutely perfect.
958036977227575296 2018-01-29 17:59:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Well, the ending of this just brought tears to my eyes.  Damn.  Well played @kendricklamar https://twitter.com/DuckworthTDE/status/957779395485323265

958009928345669632 2018-01-29 16:12:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @AgathaC80 @Doug_Bratman Many abusers do refuse to take it to authorities.  The authorities may not do anything, at all.  That does not mean the abuse did not happen.
957817291374292993 2018-01-28 03:26:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Thurgood76 @drluebbers @CaptScarecrow2 @TBBW1 @blynchehaun @justint035 LoL.  He blocked me.  Hilarious.  Got straight up abusive and then blocked me.  Good thing, too.  It's for the best.  I was about to block him and my only regret is I did not have the honor of going first.
957816728351801344 2018-01-28 03:24:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @AgathaC80 @Doug_Bratman Yes, but this man is known for much more when it comes to deplorable public actions, lately.  I feel it is not out of bounds for this to be his action.  Also, I feel it was all consentual.
957815725678358529 2018-01-28 03:20:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @Doug_Bratman @AgathaC80 Actually, I believe this man has some good points.  I believe much of the same, but I have a gut feeling that Chachi is in the wrong.  He fits the profile.
957802765010554880 2018-01-28 02:29:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Thurgood76 @drluebbers @CaptScarecrow2 @TBBW1 @justint035 @blynchehaun Attacking me and not the argument is pretty petty.  In fact, it's an ad hominem fallacy and an abuse tactic and derailment.  I have seen amazing results from acupuncture.  That is a fact.
957802416690393088 2018-01-28 02:27:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO Cool, will do!  I am also checking out Sager on Xotic.  Tom's has good things to say about them.  I wish I could afford an Origin.  I hear good things!

There are two sides to this debate as with many medical debates.  Let it go, lol.  You're not convincing everyone by continuing a 1-sided argument.
957790014263447552 2018-01-28 01:38:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @AgathaC80 @Doug_Bratman Actually, this isn't sexism... this is about listening to assault victims.  It's not just women being assaulted, but it IS women who are finally standing up to be heard.  We've silenced our women for far too long.  #TimesUp
957789599232864256 2018-01-28 01:36:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @AgathaC80 @Doug_Bratman Actually, old offenses like this are very common.  Most people, again, are too afraid of not being heard or they feel ashamed or they do not know what to do... so they keep it locked up inside and don't say anything for 20 years.  One day, it just hits you... and you remember.
957788533523173376 2018-01-28 01:32:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Wow, this person's psychologal projection is so perfectly blatant.  Interesting case study you've shared, @RadioFreeTom.
957788073445806081 2018-01-28 01:30:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate Perfect.  We can erect the wall on a long space of beachfront property I own on the U.S. Mexico Border.  It is, in fact, the U.S. Mexico Border.
957780633085935622 2018-01-28 01:01:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @Doug_Bratman Trauma stories can change, and this is oftentimes due to embarassment and shame from the victim.  Believe me, it takes a long time to work through all of that muck.  On the other hand, there are sometimes false reports... They just don't happen very often.
957738703631286273 2018-01-28 22:14:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @Doug_Bratman Thanks for listening and being compassionate and reasonable.
957738587952467968 2018-01-28 22:14:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @Doug_Bratman Unfortunately, proving sexual assault is really insanely tough to do. I'm still inclined to believe, and that is my choice.
957731544612917248 2018-01-28 21:46:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @Doug_Bratman I don't believe a word that comes out of Trump's mouth, ever.  He's been caught in so many lies it's ridiculous.

957721929544294400 2018-01-28 21:07:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @Doug_Bratman Wow, it's not.  You're serious.  You're actually talking about her looks to discredit her!?  LOL.  You guys don't take sexual assault seriously, by any means.  Hilarious.
957720066119946241 2018-01-28 21:00:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @nvidia @Polygon I certainly hope you guys do.  I want an Nvidia GPU, but many have doubled in price over the last month due to lack of availability... what is up with these crypto currency miners?  I just want to game.  @Nvidia, Please help!
957718940825915393 2018-01-28 20:56:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DrOz @ScottBaio You're so full of shit.  You obviously "messed around" with her before she turned 18, but you did not have full intercourse until after she was 18.  Congrats on being a hipocrite. Also, you do realized that Trump has sexually assaulted scores of women, yes?  #BirdsOfAFeather
957717059080769538 2018-01-28 20:48:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NicoleEggert @proudsportmom @ScottBaio @TheMIXXRadio Please, link the evidence.
957716114422845440 2018-01-28 20:44:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider Good job, @ScottBaio.  You should win an award for being hipocritical, judgemental, and ironically unsurprising all at the same time.  Damn, Chachi.
957715965529206784 2018-01-28 20:44:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @decider @Doug_Bratman Wait... This is a Trump quote, yes?
957714224763015173 2018-01-28 20:37:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @OCMAMA714 @ABC Funny that they are fighting this multi-billion dollar industry to strongly.  They will never be able to stop the flow, so perhaps the focus should be on fighting addiction instead of cocaine itself.  Just a thought.

That is extremely unethical.

Acupuncturists in the US work through masters programs and come out with a very similar education to that of Physical Therpists.

This is backed up by medical literature and science.  This is a form of acupuncture.

They are also not from "astrology-based bloodletting."  They come from China and focus on energy points in the body.  I'm an LMT and this is something I've researched pretty extensively.
957523095413231617 2018-01-27 07:57:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @drluebbers I had a doctor want to rip out my colon. I had a homeopath put me on the Elimination Diet.

957433077332168704 2018-01-27 02:00:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RadioFreeTom Way to derail the conversation by pointing out something completely irrelevant.

957149177867272192 2018-01-26 07:12:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JRubinBlogger @martinmincali @advisorrob @mikenor316 @pjbruno79 @FL_Pundit Huh.  The Fusion GPS report was out within 48 hours.  What it details is pretty damning of 45.  Funny that Nunes would not "release the memo" if it did exist and were as damning as people believe it to be.  I really don't feel like this even exists.
957148478593011712 2018-01-26 07:09:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JRubinBlogger @martinmincali @advisorrob @wbtphdjd @EePat Yes, because if Mueller is going to pull this off he has to have as much damning evidence as possible about as many crimes as he can discover.  We are talking about not only taking down a president, but an authoritarian demagogue.
957147825397264384 2018-01-26 07:06:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Mobute @willsommer @OhTHATdick This was my first intuitive feeling.  He's deleting his own account and will reactivate it after the weekend coupled with a rant about how @williamlegate shadowbanned him for Obama and Soros.  LOL.  What a fucking nut job.

956953309801218048 2018-01-26 18:13:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @nytimes @vlime286 Which is still important.  They are supposed to.give us the news and http://let.us decide what to do with it.

956937406812483584 2018-01-26 17:10:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @wwbookclub @MidnightSnitch3 Also, I just want to add a little factoid: The actress who played Luna Lovegood in the movies, Evanna Lynch, actually had an eating disorder. She fell in love with the character in the books. She started eating again to audition for the part, won, and became friends with Rowling.
956936897850413056 2018-01-26 17:08:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @wwbookclub @MidnightSnitch3 She's very intuitive in nature.

956596142590119936 2018-01-25 18:34:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle Voted Bernie in the primary and Hillary in the general.  To me, there were no other choices.

It comes from PTSD and anxiety "triggers."  When words, actions, or events trigger the release of cortisol in the body and your stress reaction becomes physical and unstoppable.  I have PTSD. As a veteran, maybe you know others.

956023998755803136 2018-01-23 04:40:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @phaedra1203 What the hell are you talking about??? Bernie was screwd by the DNC and we have the emails to prove it.  He was the better dandidate in nearly every poll.  The DNC tried to install a queen and it backfired.  This is part of the reason we are in this mess to begin with.

I just found statistics and figured out the percentages myself.  The Chicago statistic is from Time magazine and is quoting the Chicago Police Department.

"The Chicago Police Department released statistics Monday that show the number of homicides fell from 771 in 2016 to 650 last year. The number of shootings dropped from 3,550 to 2,785 during the same period."

It's more that you teach boys to take responsibility for their actions, teach healthy touch, and teaching them to be more in touch with their emotions.  SO, yes, the things you said, but it's more complicated than that.

Thanks for not listening and just assuming this is all just "liberal logic" rather than an actual social problem

We teach them that they cannot touch their male friends, even to hug or console them.  That is a HUGE problem. When you disconnect emotion, to disconnect empathy.

955867954792542209 2018-01-23 18:20:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @anustart2017 @priorylives @JohnRHornbuckle Societal change takes time.  A change like the ERA would be more than symbolic, but it may seem that way at first while society adjusts to these changes.  We would have to wait for those who are not willing to see the impact of the change (like yourself) to leave society, or die.
955865807745159173 2018-01-23 18:12:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @rstemmler24 @dennisclang I was unaware of tri-care paying for emergency abortion services.  Still, Planned Parenthood does not fund abortions.

955828768765038592 2018-01-23 15:45:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @anustart2017 @priorylives @JohnRHornbuckle Your right.  It takes major social changes for that to happen.  An ERA would be the first step toward seeing this change happen.  After that, it takes roughly 100 years for the changes to really solidify. Sociology is great.
955801600508989440 2018-01-23 13:57:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JohnKwue @funder I've been saying this the entire time.
955793518840176640 2018-01-23 13:25:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @GreenManGaming Now all I can hear in my head is "you can't see me" in the Duke's voice.  Thanks.

955786978842247168 2018-01-23 12:59:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JohnRHornbuckle @casurfer1 "nanny states" meaning that they take care of their citizens??  LoL.

955640681611038720 2018-01-22 03:17:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle My first thought was "don't shame the woman," but then I got to the punchline... and I lost it.  My girlfriend lost it, too.  We needed a good laugh.

955614461389426688 2018-01-22 01:33:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @JohnRHornbuckle @rstemmler24 @dennisclang @DinobotPrime Because when people are talking about removing those drugs from insurance payment, they will not be available for medical conditions.

That is not something that does not make for good debate, as it is.... but, it is still rather sexist to assume most women would be immediately deviant.
955611249009668096 2018-01-22 01:20:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @JohnRHornbuckle @rstemmler24 @dennisclang @DinobotPrime Treating hypertension?  Also, I support Plan B and other most other forms of birth control.
955610849657409536 2018-01-22 01:19:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IWriteAllDay_ That's not a very positive thing for them to do.  :/  Do you have links?

What you said is sexist, and kind of misogynistic.
955609427285102592 2018-01-22 01:13:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @JohnRHornbuckle @rstemmler24 @dennisclang @DinobotPrime WOAH, hold up. You DON'T pay for their abortions.  Not a single taxpayer dollar goes toward abortions.  Also, Planned Parenthood may give out some birth control, but pregnancy is not the sole usage for birth control.. some women need it for severe medical conditions.
955608734125916160 2018-01-22 01:10:51 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @krassenstein Fuck me.... why!?

That is a generalization and it is simply not true.
955608110432964611 2018-01-22 01:08:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @JohnRHornbuckle @rstemmler24 @DinobotPrime @dennisclang While that may be true, it doesn't mean we should not fight for women to have full bodily autonomy when it comes to their reproductive organs.  Also, I don't support the draft, either.  I feel it should be abolished completely.
955607874734055424 2018-01-22 01:07:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @JohnRHornbuckle @dennisclang @rstemmler24 @DinobotPrime It doesn't matter what the average active duty military employee wants, if there were a draft they would just have to deal with it.

SO, yes, it would be political suicide to enact the draft, it was not popular, and yes it still exists... seriously, though, just stop arguing.
955606560344068096 2018-01-22 01:02:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @dubsteppenwolf I mean...  are they both satirical accounts???  LOL.

It's very unlikely, but not abolished.  Our voter registration doubles as a draft card, I believe.

It's called "selective service" and EVERY male signs up when they turn 18 in the U.S.  They do have to "sign off on it" because that is how to officially enact the draft... the database of names is already there.
955604289107447808 2018-01-22 00:53:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pnehlen Good to see more open anti-semites running for office.  You're a dick.

The idea is that is there ARE historical records of the man, even 80 years after his death, then there must have been a man.  What we actually know about him... well, that's where faith comes in.  We know literally nothing provable about his life.
955595525545512960 2018-01-22 00:18:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @lady29palms @JohnRHornbuckle Because an ERA would give women a stronger voice in our communities.  That connects to EVERY problem we have spoken about, so far.

I'm not certain on when women won the fight for the frontlines, but yeah.  That was within the last couple of decades, I believe.
955542495429124098 2018-01-22 20:47:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @rstemmler24 @rubinsafaya @BigotedVsBigots @JohnRHornbuckle I feel that this is absolutely in good cause.  We should be leading the world in women's rights and this should not even be up for debate.  Even if it is, hypothetically, just for show...  We should be showing the world what it means to treat women equally.
955529181076566022 2018-01-22 19:54:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @rubinsafaya @BigotedVsBigots @rstemmler24 @JohnRHornbuckle Yes, it is.

Again, though, please provide links proven women were drafted.  I'm genuinely curious and want to educate myself on this fact.

If I cannot find it myself, then I ask for supporting evidence.  If that supporting evidence comes from Fox News or Breitbart, or some other fake news outlet, then I chuckle... and move on.

955524987045203968 2018-01-22 19:38:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @MrTommyCampbell Just another Freudian slip, on their part.  The #TrumpShutdown was manufactured.  They did this on purpose to blame it on the Dems.  The Freudian slip from Trump himself was that this was a "manufactured shutdown."  It's on his Twitter feed.

Many are still not being payed the same and are being sexually-harassed no top of it, to boot.  Many are afraid to speak out for fear of losing their jobs.

Many women have been leaving jobs in Hollywood and as newcasters because of unequal pay.  Just last year, a woman left an anchor position because her male counterpart made twice as much as she did for the same job.  Google it, it's true.

That's a logical fallacy.  ALso, you're arguing with somebody who believes in Christ's existence, but also believed he has been overly diefied by the church.  Also, I could go on and on about the damnation of the divine feminine...

Either make it equal opportunity for men and women, such as they do in socialist countries like Switzerland and Sweden, or it should be NOBODY being drafted into the military against their will.

We have a very hard time proving ANYTHING in the Bible through scholarly sources.  An educated atheist would tear you apart.

Did you just pull "individual states" out of context saying that individual states HAD laws against women owning property? Reverse that. Individual states began to ALLOW wen to have property over a very long period of time, not individual states keeping women from property.

Everything they owned, earned, inherited, etc., was all legally their husbands property.  They were, in essence, owned by the husband.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_Women%27s_Property_Acts_in_the_United_States

The earliest texts we have with Jesus of Nazareth in them are some 80-200 years after his supposed death. They were written by Roman scholars. We cannot prove ANYTHING from the Bible. That is taking us off track, though. Many churches are abusive.
955487635467898880 2018-01-22 17:09:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @OriginofABCs @JohnRHornbuckle This law was created because our women have been treated unfairly for centuries.  They used to be property and unable to vote in our democracy.  That should be proof enough.
955487336002932736 2018-01-22 17:08:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @TheValuesVoter This is not even worth a comment.  This is probably a wicker-man argument.
955487011737128960 2018-01-22 17:07:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano Sad that this has never become law.  My sociology profession used these facts as a trick question last semester.  It was brilliant.

Also, if the Bible were "proven fact" then the argument for "faith in the word" becomes a very moot point. #CultTactics

Slut shaming, for instance, has lead these women to absolutely use vulgarity.  Even if this was not the case, why should you shame them for their use of language? #HelloSnowflake
955255477255966722 2018-01-21 01:47:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @timkaine They are trying to blame the shut down on the Democrats.  This way they can use it against you to stop the #BlueWave.  Pretty simple tactic since the vote shows Democrats blocking the reopening of the government.
955255133830569986 2018-01-21 01:45:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @senorrinhatch Tell the truth.  Democrats have offered not once, but twice, to keep the military open during the shutdown.  Your party leaders said "NO!"

Forget the fact that she is gorgeous, let's focus on the fact that she is intelligent, adept in the force, talented with a lightsaber, is a great pilot, etc. All of those skills are unbelievable, right? lol.
954186510504484865 2018-01-18 02:59:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @yuriismyjam @Underachiever59 @RantingF I also want to point out the Luke quote stating, "I've only seen power like this once before! It didn't scare me enough then, but it does now!"  Motherfucker fought Vader AND Palpatine at the height of their power and Kylo + Rey were more powerful than those two! Also, YODA!!!
954185643474739200 2018-01-18 02:55:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RantingF My lady and I were a little disappointed that they did not go forward with the more progressive "let's ship Finn and Poe" thing, but we that was the ONLY thing we had against Rose! Kelly Marie Tran was amazing! She may be our new favorite new character.  :D

954166210563801088 2018-01-18 01:38:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EbuyerGaming @Seagate @Vexed_GG I plan to throw 2x 2TB Firecuda SSD's into my build with Raid 0.  Already have an ssd, but some really fast storage would be great!
954165497519656960 2018-01-18 01:35:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DigitalTrends But we already have enough food to feed the ENTIRE world, we just throw 3/4 of it into the ocean every year to keep the prices in supermarkets stable for profit.  We have moved on from Malthusian theory to Neo-Malthusian theory.

And I never said you should not be proud of your white ancestry, but rather that poeple use "white pride" as a means of bigtry and racism to others.  Just an unfortunate reality that we have to face.  <3
954159776463839232 2018-01-18 01:13:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @Lieslleu @TakuraSama Nah, I just spent a good amount of time looking at the racist shit posts from @richardfencer's Twitter feed.  And, btw, the word "triggered" actually refers to the physical symptoms experienced with anxiety disorders and PTSD, not somebody being weak because they have feelings.

When you only see history as being white history and white empirialism, then yes.  When you want to see blacks and jews go back to "shitholes countries," then yes.

I'm okay with there being more gray in the mix, or rainbows. Rainbows are cool. Still, you're right too. Your anger is well directed at the social problems that matter.

953424970423599110 2018-01-16 00:33:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ALT_uscis @NomieDpuma Yeah.  Eugenics, much?  It's spooky.  Downright scary, even.
953424684820856837 2018-01-16 00:32:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate, Hilarious!  This is a great article, also.  Very informative.  I just want to add... these people know their ideas are controversial, maybe even plain unethical or wrong.  If they didn't know, they would not be worried about being banned by yourself or Twitter.
953381914345435137 2018-01-16 21:42:16 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ALT_uscis "Incredibly good genes."  "The way God made him."  Sounds like Hitler's doctor.
953381221714878464 2018-01-16 21:39:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @virgiltexas ROFL.  Nice.
953381128118906881 2018-01-16 21:39:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DGComedy I honestly don't believe him... at all.  And if he did have a mental health exam, then he payed somebody off to give him an all clear.  He is the textbook example of a clinical narcissist, at best.
953380795976179712 2018-01-16 21:37:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina Russian Christians are killing gays RIGHT NOW.  LOL.  Your view of the world is twisted.  These are things I've learned through sociology and college studies.  We can prove these things as fact, and you cannot choose your facts, Dave.
953380525292556290 2018-01-16 21:36:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina Planned Parenthood IS a free health clinic for women.  It's actually the BEST defense you have against abortion, right now.  It provides free education to STOP women from getting pregnant before they are ready.
953380089668030464 2018-01-16 21:35:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina So, we should not prevent death when we can?  Seems pretty unethical, to me.  Also, attacking me personally instead of attacking the issue is an ad hominem attack.  It's an abuse tactic that I see commonly employed amonst Trump supporters, proving you are no different than most.1
953364657418440705 2018-01-16 20:33:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @HamillHimself Nailed it, as always.  So glad that Luke Skywalker can be a hero in fanatasy AND reality.
953364422436761601 2018-01-16 20:32:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @InternetHippo @thetomzone *warns his kids about Fascism, thermonuclear war, and why Hawaii just shit their pants*
953362019171864576 2018-01-16 20:23:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @cher "Man up."  What does that mean to you?  It's pretty misogynistic.
953361361232433152 2018-01-16 20:20:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina You're right, all of that money DOES go to Planned Parenthood.  Do you know how much of that Federal money goes to abortions?  0 dollars.  Zero.  100% of that money goes to women's health exams and birth control.
953361023939043331 2018-01-16 20:19:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina While that may be true, rushing women to death because you make abortion illegal is absolutely abhorrent.  It's preventable.
953360886181359622 2018-01-16 20:18:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina Or, 100 years from now:  Why were women, Africans, and Muslims treated like 2nd class citizens?  Why was the women's equality act never passed before 2118?
953360570446745600 2018-01-16 20:17:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina I'm not swearing to get a rise or anything, just how I speak casually.  :)  Also, not directing the language at you... just using it for emphasis, I suppose.  Uhm.... My father was a sailor?  Like, literally... merchant mariner.
953360288396578816 2018-01-16 20:16:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina I'm just saying that for every possibility of a bright future, we have a looming possibility of a dark future as well.  I'd prefer Star Trek's sociolist perspective.
953346774806220800 2018-01-16 19:22:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/slideshow/198968/top-10-real-life-star-trek-inventions/  That's fine, but we are talking about how scientific fantasy can become scientific fact.  The reason "The Handmaid's Tale" is so popular is because it is so fucking believable.
953346395905429504 2018-01-16 19:21:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina Most mental handicaps cannot be seen in the womb.  What we  are talking about are babies born with what we know will be extreme physical handicaps, some of them leading to death.  Still, my point stands:  Women have the right to bodily autonomy.
953346024852131840 2018-01-16 19:19:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina So a woman should stop having sex because she might get pregnant?  Maybe you should stop having sex because you might get someone pregnant.  Men don't have to worry about pregnancy, women do.  *shrug*
953345831494717441 2018-01-16 19:18:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina LOL.  You support an open racist, Donald Trump, and you want to compare yourself to an abolitinist because of your stance on abortion?  You do realize that white supremacists all over the country are praising Trump for sharing their beliefs, don't you?  There is no comparison.
953345471669506048 2018-01-16 19:17:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina You will find it is not.  The same way slavery was not just about State's rights, but about the freedom and equality of African Americans, the fight for abortion is VERY much about a woman's bodily automony and medical safety.
953344774026809344 2018-01-16 19:14:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina Yeah, so now we have x-ray machines the size of a suitcase, tablet computers, food replicators, universal translators, the "holodeck" holograms, teleportation, etc..  There is SOOO much in Star Trek that was "fantasy" but is now a reality.  That's a great point.
953343647172513792 2018-01-16 19:10:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina I guarantee that EVERY woman thinks about this before having sex.  110% of the time.
953343473834516482 2018-01-16 19:09:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina And death from miscarriage, prenatal problems, and birth complications... or a child being born with major birth defects... or creating more single moms when the man dips out on his woman and refuses to raise the child.  These are consequences of getting rid of abortion.
953342568623935489 2018-01-16 19:05:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina No, but you are wanting to force women to carry a baby to term.  That is enacting control over women, as if the woman were nothing but property... or an object.  The point here is not just abortion, it's women's rights to be treated equal and fairly in the eyes of the law.
953342175781294080 2018-01-16 19:04:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina It may be a fantasy drama, but it is a dystopian future that is not completely out of the bounds of possible reality. We have seen, and done, much worse in our past as human beings, so what's to say this type of authoritarian/dyspotian future is not plausible?
953341423105069056 2018-01-16 19:01:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina I absolutely can use that.  Also, these women don't need to be raped to justify being in control of their personal bodily autonomy.  If you were sick with cancer I would not walk in the room and say "stop giving him chemotherapy, it's against my personal beliefs."  It's the same.
953340281667096577 2018-01-16 18:56:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina But, you are wanting to give the government ownership over a woman's body. She literally cannot make the decision for herself. Your argument is a moot point if you don't see this. Forcing women to make decisions about their bodies is no different that slavery, at this point.
953337114657214465 2018-01-16 18:44:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina Your pulling the heart strings, you really are Dave.  But, I am a staunch feminist and I believe this is a woman's decision.  It is her body, her uterus carrying that fetus, and ultimately her decision.
953335890721558528 2018-01-16 18:39:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina I'm not arguing that there is not contraception.  Maybe you be for sex education in middle school to stop teen pregnancies?  Seems like educating our children about sex and different types of contraception would be a fair way to create less room for future abortions.  :P
953335576018767873 2018-01-16 18:38:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina Being raped and forced to carry the baby to term or medical conditions that lead to possibly lethal birth.  The point here is IT IS NOT YOUR BODY!!  Forcing women to have children they don't want takes us one step closing to living in "The Handmaid's Tale."
953330955686735872 2018-01-16 18:19:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @windowscentral It was their lack of app devolopement that screwed the windows phone.  I would have loved to own IF I could have access to the Google Play Store.  I don't know why Windows did not focus more on making apps friendly and accessible.
953330485433860096 2018-01-16 18:17:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @andylassner He says what racist white people are thinking.  I don't believe they make up even 32% of Americans.  More like his base is 32% and *maybe* 50% of that, at best, are openly racist... with 10% of that 32% being white supremacists.

953327297075040257 2018-01-16 18:05:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @LevineJonathan @senorrinhatch Hilarious that the official Twitter account for Orrin Hatch replied.  :D  Good one!
953326930769645571 2018-01-16 18:03:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @LevineJonathan I've done this.  Seriously.
953326228471246849 2018-01-16 18:00:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @thetomzone Wow.  The title of that second article reeks of rape culture.
953325606527291393 2018-01-16 17:58:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina I wasn't trying to do that at all, just stating a fact.  And I will state another one:  If you make abortions illegal, desperate women will absolutely turn to back alley abortions again.  You will be sentencing women to death.  There are many reasons women make this decision.

953306798353764353 2018-01-16 16:43:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina Abortion we can argue about all day.  It's a very touchy ethical subject, because of religion.  But, many more women were suffering and dying before abortion was legalized.
953305972755361797 2018-01-16 16:40:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IWriteAllDay_ @joelgarry I just said the complete opposite of what you are claiming.  Nobody is rejecting anyone's help.  YOU are not listening.   Instead, you are providing the "not all men" or racial comments.
953164384502734848 2018-01-15 07:17:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EnermaxUSA @Dimitry49 @hardwarecanucks What's up with all those fans?  LOL.
953162698799403008 2018-01-15 07:11:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CommonGOPvoter Feminist here. I don't watch the bachelor. Also, there is the bachelorette. I don't watch that, either. Those shows are trashy for many reasons, not just for the continuation of the patriarchal tradition of female ownership by their male counterparts.
953160466376871936 2018-01-15 07:02:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @sirDukeDevin And then refused to rent him an apartment.
953159863558901760 2018-01-15 06:59:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheTylt Look up Neo-Malthusian Theorum and you will understand exactly why.
953158936701603840 2018-01-15 06:56:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate That's it, I want in.  
953158606110765056 2018-01-15 06:54:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @karenhunter @eugenegu @SXMUrbanView I just listened to this.  Thanks for sharing.  It is absolutely terrifying that an academic institution would do this.  I was considering @VanderbiltU for my MFA later down the road, but after this... they are off my list.  Keep up the good fight, Dr. Gu.  #Resist
953157313359155200 2018-01-15 06:49:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @VUMChealth I am a college student in Knoxville, TN.  I am studying Fine Art and was considering Vanderbilt as a possible place to study for my MFA. After what happened with @eugenegu, I will be looking elsewhere.  P.s. I currently have a 4.0.
953152774501552129 2018-01-15 06:31:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IWriteAllDay_ @joelgarry Your "not all white people" stance is absolutely the point of sharing the above quotes.  We already know that Dr. King would not reject those who are willing to help.  Check your privilege at the door and THEN you might be able to join the fight.
953151631612370945 2018-01-15 06:27:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IWriteAllDay_ Okay, this absolutely answered my question about "poverty being a minority."  Damn, Dr. King was abosolutely brilliant.  Thank you so much for sharing this!!
953151273905410050 2018-01-15 06:25:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IWriteAllDay_ Would you consider those in poverty to be a minority??  Trying to ask this question from a different perspective... one that doesn't include separation by race.
953150942521823232 2018-01-15 06:24:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IWriteAllDay_ This definitely sounds quite Marxist.  Conflict Theory, FTW.
953150635553296384 2018-01-15 06:23:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IWriteAllDay_ Damn, he's almost getting Marxist on this one.
953150455907045376 2018-01-15 06:22:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IWriteAllDay_ 100% behind this.  <3
953150382397624320 2018-01-15 06:22:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IWriteAllDay_ Fuck the status quo.  I want to see you rise the fuck up.
953149950220800001 2018-01-15 06:20:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IWriteAllDay_ We're there.  Trump is a sure sign of the spiritual death of this country.  Here's to hoping we can create something greater, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.
953148933844422656 2018-01-15 06:16:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RawStory Sounds like a real shithole.
953147809498390528 2018-01-15 06:12:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @adharves Absolutely heartbreaking.
953147383042502657 2018-01-15 06:10:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ExDemLatina Slavery was legal.  Concentration camps were legal.  Just because something is legal doesn't make it morally or ethically right.

953002401325346821 2018-01-15 20:34:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JoieQ101 Actually, leaking a photo without permission is against Twitter's terms of service.  The account was probably deleted because somebody complained, as it would be for anybody else.  Paranoid Trump followers are the best.
953001455157424130 2018-01-15 20:30:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KatieBrains You do realize that shadowbanning on Twitter is not real.  You're feeding into a false conspiracy.  LOL.

952978308928557057 2018-01-15 18:58:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CommonGOPvoter Wait... what is with all of those "because?"  It makes your sentence literally incomprehensible.
952978107341950976 2018-01-15 18:57:40 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CommonGOPvoter Funny how the Democrats and Republicans have switched sides through the years.  Now the Democrats seem to hold family values while the Republicans are backing a narcissistic man who sexually assaults women and threatens to start nuclear war.
952947351794212864 2018-01-15 16:55:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @Tabz75 @jantwit Maybe all of this is the real reason he won't release his tax returns?  Trump claims to have at least 10 billion, but I honestly feel it's more like 2-3 billion.  Just a thought.
952946856304238595 2018-01-15 16:53:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @HamillHimself Damn.  Midget is a derogatory term these days, isn't it?  I think they look amazing!  People can be so insensitive.

952756655296471041 2018-01-14 04:17:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @susanalexande13 This is true.
952753626598035456 2018-01-14 04:05:40 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen One problem... he has BILLIONS to pay off high priced lawyers.  They can tie shit up in litigation for decades.  They literally have in the past.

952749560136388609 2018-01-14 03:49:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @evepeyser You should go research "global stratification" before saying anything about "third world" countries.
952749152810819584 2018-01-14 03:47:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @evepeyser HAH. you finally admitted he said something racist.  Thanks guys!  But seriously.... calling all of Africa "shithole countries" is pretty terrible...

952681554958077952 2018-01-14 23:19:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @Listentostevie6 @ChangeTheLAUSD @Lbstrdvr6 I don't think you understand the protests that have been going on or the true social state of the Union. Through sociology, we have absolutely proven that minorities are mistreated and the middle class is disappearing. These are facts. Also, comments sections are echo chambers.
952678947522859009 2018-01-14 23:08:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate I want in.  :D  LOL

952676503472439299 2018-01-14 22:59:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Lbstrdvr6 Don't deflect and change the subject.  We will fight against everything Trump is doing the same way the GOP did with Obama.
952674909448269825 2018-01-14 22:52:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @brihtwulf Is this MMO worth playing?  Considering giving it a go...
952673584870232069 2018-01-14 22:47:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CommonGOPvoter @FiveRights After Trump's racist comments this past couple of weeks, I don't fucking blame them.
952672534134165504 2018-01-14 22:43:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JoyAnnReid Because they work for the Russian Oligarchs. Seriously, it makes sense. Was it you that posted about 32 or so House Republicans not seeking reelection? Makes sense that they want to "retire" before they house comes crashing down with them inside. #RobertMuellerIsComing
952672199239979008 2018-01-14 22:42:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @wokeluisa Well, if this isn't the definition of WHITE PRIVILEGE!  LOL.  Good job Rand.  You are the problem.
952670616099880965 2018-01-14 22:35:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen @krassenstein Oh wow!  i just relized you two were brothers... I follow both of you and just looked at your last name.. my initial thought was "why does he keep changing his profile picture!?"
952670341754703872 2018-01-14 22:34:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Lbstrdvr6 You said "never."  Just proving you wrong.  And, Trump was talking up neo-nazi's saying they are "really nice guys" just a few months ago.  He just told a "really pretty Korean lady" that she should be talking to N. Korea for him rather than doing her job as a journalist. Racism.
952669898488115206 2018-01-14 22:32:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @Listentostevie6 @ChangeTheLAUSD @Lbstrdvr6 You guys keep saying snopes has no credibility, but I really don't believe that.  They are an independent fact checker and have more credibility than Fox News, for sure.
952658687537156096 2018-01-14 21:48:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Lbstrdvr6 https://www.npr.org/2016/09/29/495955920/donald-trump-plagued-by-decades-old-housing-discrimination-case  That is simply not true.  He lost a case in 1973 for discrimination against blacks in one of his NYC properties.  They wrote the letter "C," for "colored," on the applications and apartments were suddenly "unavailable." #Fact
952637166886191104 2018-01-14 20:22:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @ThinksForMyself @teerocs @Lbstrdvr6 Trump may have raped a 13 year old girl.  We're just throwing stones, at this point.  Also, bhengazi was considered a witch hunt.  Seriously, how can you even compare the 2??
952623480876478464 2018-01-14 19:28:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ashleyfeinberg I like Westworld.  LOL.  Not sure if the 2nd season is out, yet...
952623355261325318 2018-01-14 19:28:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @krassenstein 13-year old child... and 21 other women.
952623186931314690 2018-01-14 19:27:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @ThinksForMyself @teerocs @Lbstrdvr6 The "C" for color is fact, you can look up court records. We have audio of him saying "grab em by the pussy." We have audio and video showing his 1000 lies. There is serious evidence proving these things are not just "debunked."
952608575330889729 2018-01-14 18:29:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SaysHummingbird Sad day.  I heard about this a week ago. @eugenegu is an amazing man! I'm looking at art schools for 2nd half of my bachelors and MFA. Vanderbilt as on my list, but not now.  Also, I have a standing 4.0.  Their loss.
952608024841150464 2018-01-14 18:27:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kharyp @shannonrwatts I'm sorry, but we need more information on this.
952607564159700992 2018-01-14 18:25:16 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @ThinksForMyself @teerocs @Lbstrdvr6 I mean... if you want to start digging up shit we cannot prove in court.. 21 women accusing Trump of sexual assault, one of them 13, Pussy comment, "C" for colored, 1000 Lies, Russian collusion, Don Jr.'s Emails, and the list goes on and on. He is not mentally stable.
952606492661813248 2018-01-14 18:21:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Mikel_Jollett @JoyAnnReid @GavelHunter It's not even just about weed, it's a lot of the things he said he stood for during his Presidential campaign.  But now, he's the exact opposite of everything I thought he was trying to portray.
952605064480378881 2018-01-14 18:15:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Mikel_Jollett @JoyAnnReid I used to kind of like Rand Paul, but the more I see him in media lately... the more dispicable he becomes.
952587312436785153 2018-01-14 17:04:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @bluewave @williamlegate @Elise_Logan I'm on the cusp (Feb '82) and I'm 100% with you.  GO OUT AND VOTE IN 2018!!!  @BlueWave
952586365056835584 2018-01-14 17:01:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle YOu hit the nail on the head with the "gaslighting" comment. I've seen SOO much abusive rhetoric from the right, it makes my head spin. Calling out ad hominem fallacies, gaslighting tactics, wicker-/straw-man tactics, and the list goes on and on and on. #AbuseTactics
952585829389623297 2018-01-14 16:58:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @thehill @WGBone This got a literal chuckle out of me.
952585328724004864 2018-01-14 16:56:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @meakoopa @elizawmeeks Hiroshige called and he says you're wrong.  There is beautiful art all over the world, not just from rich white people.
952585118320877568 2018-01-14 16:56:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @meakoopa Being center in self and narcissism are two comlpetely different things. I do believe we have a generation of narcissist, which is very dangerous. Knowing and loving yourself is completely different. The difference? You move forward with affirmation and move past the rest.
952583005654134784 2018-01-14 16:47:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @ProudResister This isn't why DACA was dying... It was because Trump tried to remove it, not because he called countries a "shithole." Also, Trump lost the court battle over DACA yesterday when a Federal Court Judge reinstated DACA. If you are going to hate on Trump, at least check your facts.
952582488408444928 2018-01-14 16:45:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @ThinksForMyself @teerocs @Lbstrdvr6 I'll give you this, to a point. BUT, I want to say that Hillary got my vote... it was an easy choice for me because I could see how hipocritical and despicable Trump is. Bernie Sanders was my candidate. BUT, I believe Hillary is a sociopath and Trump is a clinical narcissist.
952581968058834944 2018-01-14 16:43:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @ChangeTheLAUSD @Lbstrdvr6 We can talk about collusion, if you like, but Trump doesn't know anything about the Mueller case... it's also an ongoing investigation, so you better believe there is a LOT more information we do not know as citizens of the nation.
952581653221822464 2018-01-14 16:42:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @ChangeTheLAUSD @Lbstrdvr6 More like Trump's style. LOL. When he lost the court battle on DACA yesterday, he said the system was "unfair and broken" because he lost. That's childish, IMHO.
952578687026819072 2018-01-14 16:30:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @Lbstrdvr6 @ChangeTheLAUSD Also, sources are key in academia.  Facts are always backed up by scientific journals and peer reviews.

Asked at least 10 times for proof that he is connected to Hillary after they sent me the DoJ report.  They just laughed and called me a stupid lib.
952574544090423298 2018-01-14 16:14:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @ChangeTheLAUSD @Lbstrdvr6 That's not really true.  LoL.  Snopes is independent.

I want free college, healthcare, and medical marijuana for transgender people, but we should all have guns and fewer taxes and whatnot.  LoL.
952433331567779840 2018-01-13 06:52:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate I read the Sun article about you. Did not know you were getting death threats. Stay safe, man.

I'm on the wavelength as well and feel this is definitely a sign from the collective consciousness... we have to stop this narcissistic insanity AS A NATION!!
952423810824798208 2018-01-13 06:15:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ashleyfeinberg I need a link to this app.  thanks in advance.  :D

952416992828579840 2018-01-13 05:48:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @thehill @Ravleen92 @MoreMusicMoreMo @GlossyBandits Uhm.  Not at all.  Read the article, first off.  He did not claim victory, he claimed that the system is 'unfair and broken' because he lost.... did you even read what we were talking about before you commented?  I don't think you understand, if you did.
952405320990523393 2018-01-13 05:01:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @JurgenGassner I'm currently a college student, myself.  You're right, we should all become educated.  The problem with that is the exorbitant prices for going to school...  Coming out 50-60 grand in debt is a pretty shoddy deal.

952396083266834433 2018-01-13 04:24:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @thehill @Ravleen92 @MoreMusicMoreMo Actually, Trump said the court system is "unfair and broken" because he lost this case.  It's kind of funny, if you ask me.
952395905419960320 2018-01-13 04:24:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Trump saying that the court system is "unfair and broken" because he LOST!!  Great win for DACA recipients, at least for the moment.  Thanks for the original share @Stonekettle.http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/368938-trump-admin-resumes-accepting-daca-applications?rnd=1515900991

952382856713719808 2018-01-13 03:32:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @JurgenGassner Yes, but no incentive to give a living wage.  We learned back in Reagan's day that trickle down economics is a joke.
952368086124056576 2018-01-13 02:33:40 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs @JurgenGassner That makes 0 sense at all.  Adding 1.8 trillion to the deficit does not repair the 10 trillion already there.  It adds to it.  The money we pay covers the cost of giving corporations and billionaires tax breaks. Most of the 10 trillion came from Iraq and Afghanistan, not Obama.

952289715155283971 2018-01-13 21:22:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DualityMan @DiagonalDoug So you provided evidence of one man's indictment but you still fail to provide any evidence of a link to Hillary Clinton. Well played MAGA.
952284932021346305 2018-01-13 21:03:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DiagonalDoug Hillar Clinton was NOT named in any of the information on the DoJ website.  So, please, enlighten me.  I'm waiting.
952284761367764992 2018-01-13 21:02:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DiagonalDoug I asked for clarification and you attack my person.  This is an ad hominem attack.  Instead of calling me clueless, why dont you actually show some factual evidence tying Hillary Clinton to the man being indicted.  I've tried looking it up, but there are 0 sources.
952280997978103809 2018-01-13 20:47:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DiagonalDoug I just read this and it mentions nothing about Hillary Clinton.  Googled the link between this man and the Clintons and NOTHING came up.  Seriously, I doubt there is any link between the two. Please, provide proof or STFU.
952279836059426816 2018-01-13 20:43:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DiagonalDoug Okay, I read this report... what does it have to do with Hillary?  I'm waiting.
952275866578489344 2018-01-13 20:27:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DiagonalDoug https://www.snopes.com/clinton-federal-racketeering-charges/  There are no racketeering charges.  This is 100% false.  You can tell because it's on http://infowars.com.  LOL
952275559349932034 2018-01-13 20:26:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DiagonalDoug LOL.  The Daily Wire has their own "fake news" section on http://snopes.com.  Beautiful.  "The Daily Wire Files."  That's how you know a media source is full of bullshit.

Please, tell me more about how paying for a wall is going to fix all of America's problems. Please, tell me more about how all democrats are idiots and Trump is the one true savior.

952231279092781057 2018-01-13 17:30:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TomiLahren @BGWhite42 They are stonewalling because we do not want to pay $18 billion for a wall. Trump is holding Dreamers hostage for his wall. It's despicable. You blame Democrats for things Trump is doing. He liked about Mexico paying for the wall. Why still support him?
952228101144051714 2018-01-13 17:17:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @MaxTemkin That's awesome!
952227178279784448 2018-01-13 17:13:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Education4Libs @BGWhite42 Don't worry, Trump will run things into the ground soon enough.  ;)
952226149341515776 2018-01-13 17:09:40 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @TomiLahren That's total bullshit and you know it. Dems refuse to pay $18 billion in taxpayer money to build Trumps idiotic wall as a means to approve DACA, which the President ended and then blamed Obama for ending. Trump is trying to hold the nation hostage. #FuckTrump #LikeStormyDaniels

952224610480787459 2018-01-13 17:03:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump NO, we want a deal... we just don't want to spent $18 billion in taxpayer money for your fucking wall.  #DipshitPresident
952224386714652672 2018-01-13 17:02:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BGWhite42 @Education4Libs Yes, because in 2 years our taxes start rising... and they will continue to rise until 2028, or later. You will see an immediate cut, but then a gradual rise every year. We will be paying the difference for the 1.8 trillion that this will add to our deficite. #DiminishingReturns

952210940358987779 2018-01-13 16:09:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @fribergCS From the US here. They blocked a world class MS doctor from coming to the US for a major conference on MS. He is one of the leading researchers on the world. He was originally from Iran, but lived in Europe for YEARS. It's not esports, it's "Muslim countries." #TrumpsARacist

951857989543186434 2018-01-12 16:46:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @gregorykorte *addendum* Except for shithole countries, those are obviously shitholes.
951857302155513856 2018-01-12 16:44:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @12DifferentTomb Also, it is the "artists curse" to never be satisfied with your work. We strive for perfection not realizing that the perfection is in the artist's journey, not in the work we produce. The work we produce is already perfect because we created it. Creation is next to Godliness.
951856983405187072 2018-01-12 16:42:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @12DifferentTomb This work is AMAZING!! Tell her to keep it up!  I just went back to college for Fine Art.  Following my dreams, over here.  Tell her to never give up and NEVER judge your artwork. When you judge your work, you start to critisize yourself.
951851610103218177 2018-01-12 16:21:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eugenegu @DelthiaRicks Well, this is the most bullshit thing I have seen on the internet today... and I just woke up.  How could they?  This man is amazing!
951851286542024717 2018-01-12 16:20:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ddale8 Holy shit.... This will be good.
951846867909955584 2018-01-12 16:02:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @tonyposnanski I keep reading these comments in Alec Baldwin's SNL Trump voice.
951846370041835521 2018-01-12 16:00:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @NewRightNetwork "The New Right." Don't you mean the Alt-Right? Ahem... What I'm saying is, don't you mean white supremacists?
951845300544724992 2018-01-12 15:56:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @HopeRadio1 @TalbertSwan @ChanceAfolse This is a psychological pathology, not a "normal" politician.  Why deflect and being Obama into this?  This has nothing to do with Obama.  It has everything to do with Trump having a personality disorder.  A psychological pathology.
951844796645216256 2018-01-12 15:54:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump You called them shithole counties, and we don't believe you.
951838136899948545 2018-01-12 15:27:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamcson Somebody has done their sociology homework.
951837558832533504 2018-01-12 15:25:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamcson @LeftyBob721 Actually, I could not afford insurance until Obamacare.  And I do blame the people that leech off of the working class.  It's the corporations and the rich who perpetuate wealth inequality and receive the most subsidies and tax breaks from the government.
951835942154833920 2018-01-12 15:19:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kaitlancollins @jimsciutto Oh, it is.  Saw a poll that said "are there shit hole countries?". The yesses we're winning in their echo chamber.  His base will praise everything she is doing, up to and including nuclear war. "Those 20 million civilians deserved it! Should have been born 'Merican!"

951676746235023360 2018-01-11 04:46:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @sarahkendzior @Maggyw519 @JacobRAdkins Isn't that one of the final steps of becoming a dictator?  After you discredit the media and the government, you create a false enemy and THEN make the people turn to you as their savior?  Sounds like he knew what he was doing... almost.
951672990269308928 2018-01-11 04:31:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @cmclymer Also, they have free college and legitimate inmate/addict rehabilitation, I do believe.  Norway and Denmark are the BOMB when it comes to these things.  I believe they even have really great equality laws and start teaching gender identification and respect at a young age.

I learned a lot of this in sociology last semester in college. This is verifiable fact. It's not up for debate. You cannot choose your facts, only how you react to them."

We produce enough food in America to feed the entire world.  We destroy 2/3-3/4 of it to subsidize profits. This is the opposite of feeding the neighbor. Also, Christians are the minority when it comes to being persecuted for religious beliefs. #FactsNotOpinions

Sounds kind of like the pagan "As Above, So Below."  They mirror one another.  If you create your own misery and suffering here, then on the otherside you will find only the same.

It's the people, not the buildings.  Also, it's the individual perspective that matters, not the authority of the "Church," Catholic or otherwise.  I prefer to follow my own interpretation of scripture and find my own connection with God.
951518596508856320 2018-01-11 18:18:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SarahKSilverman Don't be so hard on yourself.  It just shows that you have a big heart.  We all fuck up sometimes, but you are a philanthropist and it shows.  Accept the praise with grace and pay it forward.

Calling her a bitch is an unfair assessment for somebody you have never met.  Good call on ending the date and eating the tasty fries.
951285329062965248 2018-01-10 02:51:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @evepeyser How the fuck can they even compare the two??  It's funny.... when they diss Bernie they NEVER mention Authoritarianism or Fascism.  It's almost as if they are completely ignorant when it comes to ANYTHING dealing with the reality of government.
951283157650767874 2018-01-10 02:42:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TimRunsHisMouth She's talking about how, societally, these people will not stop spreading their hatred until they die.  They have to die out to stop the cycle.  ALso, I'm pretty sure you took this snippet out of context.  Where is what she said before?  or after?  This will lead to demonization.

He did not want a church and he fought the temples because of their greed and corruption.  He knew that a religion in his name would lead to this same corruption.

951114262663106560 2018-01-10 15:31:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @20committee His Evangelical voters would praise him for taking out a liberal Middle Eastern terrorist while claiming he was mentally ill and only lied about being Jesus to get the attention.

I grew up on Grand Isle and visited Fourchon beach a lot as a kid.  That beach and it's view of the ocean are destroyed because of oil rigs.  First it was just one or two, later it was more like 50 or 60.  The fish died. The ocean was dying.  It was terrible.

950921496406478848 2018-01-09 02:45:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @LinusTech Holy balls, Batman!! 32 DIMM SLOTS!?  WHAT!?  DUAL EPYC PROCESSORS!?!?  My God!!  This board is EXTREME!!!  I love it.
950920485549813762 2018-01-09 02:41:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @aj_the_geek Yes, as long as your images are being taken in 4k they will save in 4k.  The default is 1080p, but you can easily change this in the settings.  The phone is also very intuitive making it easier to switch from the iphone.
950916306114662401 2018-01-09 02:24:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @mattmfm @EricHolder Great!  Can we get Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, and my home state of Tennessee next?
950913581616427009 2018-01-09 02:13:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CBSNews @Sandy81798642 @Peterpan9166 @ArcticFox_am_I That is true for nearly every profession in the United States.  Welcome to Capitalism. That's the real issue.  They can just fire and replace you in my state, no questions asked.  I lost a job recently and they left the "please explain" box empty when they filed with the state.
950890667248640000 2018-01-09 00:42:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @aj_the_geek I have a Pixel and I LOVE it. It has a 4k camera that takes amazing video and stills. They automatically backup to the Google Cloud with UNLIMITED picture and video storage for FREE. It's a great deal. Also, it's by google so you get the best updates.
950885618724294656 2018-01-09 00:22:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Twitter @williamlegate @brithume I suggest getting a Google Pixel or Pixel 2.  Best way to transition from iPhone to Android with an intuitive and amazing device!  Forget Apple.  Come to the light side.  We have better cookies.
950876250700165120 2018-01-09 23:45:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate That election is so 2016.  We're looking forward to the 2018 elections, instead.
950873548289134592 2018-01-09 23:34:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @RealMilesBowker @hansauf Is your name a play on Nazi Germany?  Hilarious.  Seriously, hilarious.

950850656360960005 2018-01-09 22:03:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CommonGOPvoter Thanks for this information...  But, should they have already had this option presented a long time ago??  We need a clear path for people like this to become permanent citizens.
950807882441875456 2018-01-09 19:13:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @adamcbest Honestly, this could be a good thing for the left.  I hope they keep up the good work, honestly.
950807607022899200 2018-01-09 19:12:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @POTUS @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @georgegambini @RealMilesBowker @Latinlade58 You mean... like @FoxNews?
950802765609078784 2018-01-09 18:53:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @POTUS @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @georgegambini @RealMilesBowker @Latinlade58 The "fake news awards" is an attack on the free press. When they tell the truth about some of the things he has done that are absolutely unethical, it's their job to report. Attacking them because he wants to spread lies is not a fair assessment. This is how dictatorships begin.
950802367116701697 2018-01-09 18:52:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @HamillHimself My birthday isn't until February 9th, but I'll take early generic birthday wishes.  LOL.
950802129610072064 2018-01-09 18:51:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @rayinman Putin and Russia??  LOL.
950790264779673602 2018-01-09 18:03:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @nytimes I would like to take this time to thank Joe Arpaio for another Democratic special election win.  ;)
950790019412832256 2018-01-09 18:03:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheRickWilson Yeah.  Pretty sure this will equal another Democratic win.  If it doesn't, I will be highly surprised.
950780727670530048 2018-01-09 17:26:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @georgegambini @RealMilesBowker @nichtpolitik Yeah, this goes back to the whole "burden of proof" argument that somebody posed yesterday.
950780537228185600 2018-01-09 17:25:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @goldengateblond @SarahEMcBride @quinn_ze_eskimo So, please... Let's just make sure that if you are going to discredit this amazingly strong black woman that you are doing it for the right reasons and not just smearing her name through the mud because she is black or a woman.  Her good qualities absolutely shine.
950780155819167752 2018-01-09 17:23:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @goldengateblond @SarahEMcBride @quinn_ze_eskimo That being said, I believe somebody like Oprah would be 1000x more qualified than the current POTUS when it comes to being diplomatic, understanding the full extent of what is required for the job, and understanding the intricacies of domestic and foreign policies.
950779808673423369 2018-01-09 17:22:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @goldengateblond @SarahEMcBride @quinn_ze_eskimo And don't get me wrong.  I'm not endorsing Oprah, but what I am suggesting is that this experiment of electing a celebrity business man (or woman) to the Oval office COULD work, but that Trump is the absolute worst example from which to base your assumptions.
950779463566061568 2018-01-09 17:21:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @goldengateblond @SarahEMcBride @quinn_ze_eskimo Everyone made the argument that "Trump would be okay if he surrounds himself with people who DO have experience." We see, that with Trump, at least, that this is absolutely not the case. He's too narcissistic to listen to anyone. That's his #1 issue. He has a personality disorder
950779035059216384 2018-01-09 17:19:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @goldengateblond @SarahEMcBride @quinn_ze_eskimo All of this qualifies her to understand other human beings at their core and to help heal a nation that is currently being ravaged by evil men with evil intentions.  There is more to Oprah than meets they eye.  Oh, and she also has name recognition.  Let's not forget about that.
950778774689378304 2018-01-09 17:18:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @goldengateblond @SarahEMcBride @quinn_ze_eskimo I feel that trying to hold her back because she is not a career politician is a terrible idea.  She is a self-made billionaire.  She runs companies, not just television shows.  She understands adversity and trauma and poverty in very intimate and personal ways.
950778508439183360 2018-01-09 17:17:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @goldengateblond @SarahEMcBride @quinn_ze_eskimo I don't feel that political experience is the problem, here.  Current POTUS is a much bigger issue that not being a career politician.  Oprah is poised, intelligent, willing to listen to advise of others, charismatic, empathetic, and has many other great qualities.
950777906804002817 2018-01-09 17:14:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jesserobkin @SarahEMcBride @Keonyn @CurtisCBallII1 I'm just trying to break down the walls between the GOP and Liberal echo chambers, at this point.  The only way we can move forward as a country is to stop this polarization and work together.  Polarization got us into this mess in the first place.
950775906255147008 2018-01-09 17:06:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @tootickedoff That's insulting to the intelligence of people you don't even know.
950775726382440448 2018-01-09 17:06:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @tootickedoff You're in a GOP echo chamber if you believe liberals are your enemies.
950617704817397760 2018-01-08 06:38:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RantingF Nevermind, found it.  Thanks!
950617593387380736 2018-01-08 06:37:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RantingF Can you explain "ethnostate."  *curious*
950617377619828736 2018-01-08 06:36:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @chrissyteigen Hollow Knight is A+++ if you can get it on switch.  Side scroller, Castlevania: SOTN style RPG, brilliant visual and music.  I can't rave about it enough!  It's a tough game, though!!!  Seriously, my favorite game of 2017.
950592293320515585 2018-01-08 04:57:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TimRunsHisMouth For exercising his first amendment right?  I think not.... But, I also think this is a satirical post.  :P
950591996896391168 2018-01-08 04:56:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @georgegambini @RealMilesBowker I'm sure that when you say "as a model for the future" you are meaning "as a model for what to watch out for during a Facist power grab." He's very similar, in a lot of ways. Not nearly as intelligent or eloquent, but yeah... We have to end these echo chambers and stop fighting.
950590830661824512 2018-01-08 04:51:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SHSanders45 @PressSec @MichaelSkolnik He does know the words.  he sang them at Arlington Cemetery on his visit, there.  He looks extremely tired... He's already been to TN today and now ATL?  He's been travelling all day and that would make any of us tired.  I'm part of the resistance and I feel this is pushing it...
950590102077673473 2018-01-08 04:48:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @georgegambini @RealMilesBowker Honestly, his attacks on the press are one of the first steps toward a fascist dictatorship.  He is 100% an authoritarian, and that is a huge problem to me.  You should study up a little on how Nazi Germany came to be.  I do prefer to be level-headed, though. I want #peace.
950587488615194624 2018-01-08 04:38:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @georgegambini @RealMilesBowker Miles, I actually agree with you on this.  I do not think Trump is completely sane... I feel he may have a personality disorder, but people are 100% looking for ANYTHING they can to attack him as a person.  I don't agree with a lot of what he is doing, but I agree with you.
950585696720482304 2018-01-08 04:31:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> So tired of living in echo chambers.  Seriously.
950585356256243712 2018-01-08 04:29:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @georgegambini @RealMilesBowker "All signs point to fascism.  You should learn more about fascism."  Better?  You know you can understand the meaning of the sentence.
950582052432285697 2018-01-08 04:16:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @bitwitkyle *cues up the 70's funk music*
950581901168971776 2018-01-08 04:16:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @LinusTech ROFL!!!  I take it this is not actually Linus posting.  :D
950581500117966848 2018-01-08 04:14:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate Yes. The division between our people is the end-game, in a lot of ways. Still, I do not support a lot of the things Trump is doing or getting us into. Despite our differences in politics, we should be able to have this conversation with the utmost respect for one another. Thanks.
950581101621338117 2018-01-08 04:12:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @BriBlevins Actually, this man has been private messaging me and, while I do not agree with Trump and his politics, this guy does not deserve your attacks.  He's intelligent, heartfelt, and a good person.  Leave him be.
950574774597627904 2018-01-08 03:47:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @cmclymer @SaudadeAlma @MrCScienceT @lex_shmitty I, personally, feel that the best thing I can do to support this movement, even as a sexual assault victim myself, is to "sit down and shut up" while our women speak.  It's your turn.  #MeToo
950574136811819008 2018-01-08 03:45:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @laurastampler @cmclymer @hk_norman Many of them also wore black shirts, like Chris Hemsworth.  I feel that spoke 1000 words.
950573869282332672 2018-01-08 03:44:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @cmclymer I don't completely feel this is a terrible thing.  I feel that it's time for us to shut up and actually listen, for a change.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not sure what I would say.  I support the movement 100% and I'm at a loss for words, a lot of the time.
950573215453151232 2018-01-08 03:41:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @GeorgeTakei He called the race "rigged" when he won.... because he lost the popular vote.  LOL.  I can't imagine the twitter shitstorm that would follow if he lost to Oprah Winfrey.
950573061912264705 2018-01-08 03:40:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ChuckModi1 The fuck is going on here?  Huge police presence, for what???
950572792914894848 2018-01-08 03:39:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle He knew the words back at Arlington Cemetery, when he visited.  He looks troubled... as if he suddenly can't remember that and it's bothering him.  Demetia much?

950557846810349568 2018-01-08 02:40:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate Actually, you're right.  I was 100% wrong.  Your had is made in America and I apologize.  I've been a total dick, but I was triggered by being told to "piss off."  Why the hell are we so reactive, these days?  All of us?
950557494794911745 2018-01-08 02:39:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate @BriBlevins He posted pictures of his tag.  It's legit made in America.  I'll give him that, for sure.
950549518751330305 2018-01-08 02:07:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate @gifdsports This could be a sign of demetia, or just being plain tired after a long day.  *shrug*
950548922417713152 2018-01-08 02:04:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @dbongino @SandraPfaff57 @carasm10 No, actually, it's not.  I wrote a lot more, if you care to find it.  And I'm not calling anyone stupid, I'm calling her a racist.
950548531122790402 2018-01-08 02:03:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate YOu told me to "piss off snowflake" and I replied, very kindly, with "Fuck you, Dave."  It's pretty simple.  You insulted me and I responded with the same type of kind words.  "Let ye who is free of sin throw the first stone...."
950548079404638209 2018-01-08 02:01:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Everyone is talking about Trump not knowing the National Anthem... but if you look up the video of him singing the national anthem at Arlington Cemetery, he did know the words then.  It's been a few months. Is he tired or does he not remember?  He looks like he does not remember.
950546257096970240 2018-01-08 01:54:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @antiecm I hope you enjoy paying $18 Billion dollars for that wall he told you Mexico was going to pay for, if that is the case.
950544438341898245 2018-01-08 01:47:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle Honestly, I just tell him directly on his twitter feed nearly evcery day.  I still haven't been blocked.  SAD!!
950543291942146049 2018-01-08 01:42:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @charliekirk11 @williamlegate When we have a fascist leader installed by a communist regime, should I be getting over it?
950543037360476162 2018-01-08 01:41:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle @stonekettle, you're killing me with these one-liners!!!  :D
950542737438334977 2018-01-08 01:40:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @_rone He looks forgetful in this video... wtf?  I just watched him bobbing his head at Arlington Cemetery a few months back and he definitely knew the words.
950542490842656768 2018-01-08 01:39:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> You guys never post pics, just empty messages full of lies.  Why?  Why have you never posted pics even though you post credits, and whatnot?  This is a common theme, you guys!! I love your ram, but I hate this anticipation!!! WHERE IS BATMAN!?
950539399661531136 2018-01-08 01:27:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Oprah Somebody is gunning for VP, eh @RWitherspoon??  
950532349128736768 2018-01-08 00:59:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @dbongino @SandraPfaff57 Also, your projection if "maybe they were racist" is a common psychological tool used when somebody is unwilling to admit fault within themselves.  You should see a therapist.  A black therapist.
950532052847419393 2018-01-08 00:57:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @dbongino @SandraPfaff57 You said he was given the Nobel peace prize for being black, not because of the achievements he made toward world Peace.  That is literally racism.  You made it about race, nothing else.
950531522897088515 2018-01-08 00:55:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FarmBureau @realDonaldTrump @MarshaBlackburn @DistractedChem @swcollings @JessicaDDesign Of course!!  I hate baseless claims.
950474711305252865 2018-01-08 21:10:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> I really love it when GOP Conservatives are arguing with you and ask for sources; wherein, when provided with sources, they suddenly stop messaging you.  It's like their brains shut down when they are overwhelmed by too much factual input.

950469930855616513 2018-01-08 20:51:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TUSK81 DACA was the first step toward getting into that line.

950468836431712256 2018-01-08 20:46:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @es_arman This is absolute bullshit... I'm sorry you have had to go through this.  Where were you born?  We are not all like this and I'm sorry our President is holding you back.  This is a sad state of affairs.

The system is broken.

They would write the letter "C" for "colored" and refuse to rent to people of color. He LOST this case and called it a "big win for Trump." #ClinicalNarcissim #CantLose
950466939243053056 2018-01-08 20:39:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FarmBureau @realDonaldTrump @MarshaBlackburn You encompass everything that I find morally and ethically reprehensible. I cannot fathom how you are still being elected as lader of our great state. This man is trying to rob us of our healthcare and you're still supporting him.

950443963919556608 2018-01-08 19:07:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO This will put people out of the job.  Yay, automation!!!

950413422113492992 2018-01-08 17:06:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @dbongino @SandraPfaff57 Sandy, you and Dan are blatant racists. Openly racist, even. The fact that you cannot see this for yourself is an obvious display of the Dunning-Kruger effect. When you Google this, it will be further proof. 1940 called, they want their racism back.

950407270361452544 2018-01-08 16:42:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @dbongino @SandraPfaff57 Well, I think I just won this round of "Spot the Racist."
950406694936481793 2018-01-08 16:39:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pablorodas But, you're wrong in that comment.  She has led a life of service to the people of this country.  100%.  She has a lot going for her, especially name recognition.
950406189900234752 2018-01-08 16:37:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pablorodas She has lived a life of public service and, unlike Trump, is a self-made billionaire. She's got the tone, the demeanor, the experience, and the understanding of trauma and poverty to be a great president for the people. She grew up common folk.

950156578279317506 2018-01-07 00:05:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen I mean....  would he even admit the truth if Mueller said, "I'm investigating you." ???  I doubt it.  When he lost in court due to allegations of discrimination at his apartments buildings in NYC back in the day, he called it a "great victory."

I want to interject, though, that society is based on shared morality. Things like "Murderers go to prison" or "rapists go to jail." There are other moral conundrums, as well. This is why we have ethics commities.

949738002812686337 2018-01-06 20:22:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate That is not the right question.... the question is if they have the mental capacity, with lower education in rural communities, to actually understand that their babies are not being turned into demons by Doug Jones.

949682838168797184 2018-01-06 16:43:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @bessbell Fucking LOL.  Thanks for this.

949681979410313217 2018-01-06 16:40:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KamalaHarris Can you stop this at the state level??

949453021251080192 2018-01-05 01:30:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @rabiasquared It's funny... My first thought was "Trump went through all of that, just today??"  Then it hit me... You're a mom.  :)
949448270115467264 2018-01-05 01:11:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle I had 2/3 from that list already on follow.  Just added the last one.  I love it!
949447217638723585 2018-01-05 01:07:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eTeknix That is ABSOLUTELY a BAD IDEA!!!  It's ONLY 3% alcohol by volume!!
949444526938185728 2018-01-05 00:56:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FoxNews @theitchypenguin @Scattermae777M The average Republican does nothing but attack the people around them who disagree.  You are literally not intelligent enough to form your own arguments; therefore, you steal the arguments of other's as a means to make up for your lack of intellect.
949443846202634240 2018-01-05 00:53:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FoxNews @MissDoozy @RepStevenSmith @mattes_frank My first thought was that somebody burned it down maliciously.
949424121686953984 2018-01-05 23:35:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Per @RantingF, The economy should support the people, the people should not support the economy.
949365248405929985 2018-01-05 19:41:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump I'm sure 18 billions dollars would be better spent on healthcare, college education, or infrastructure for our great Union rather than building a useless wall between here and Mexico.
949364853537476613 2018-01-05 19:39:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump The new book is sold out everywhere and is officially the #1 best seller in the U.S. right now.
949359625945714690 2018-01-05 19:19:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate Best joke of 2018.  We can all go home, now.
949359018044248065 2018-01-05 19:16:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @MEPFuller If you ask me, it will look like the Republicans are all traitors to Russia.

949146535559704576 2018-01-04 05:12:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Guinz Slightly off-topic, but I've been calling Trump "Small-Hands Hilter" and "Twitter-in-Chief" for the past year.  ;D
949142326730895360 2018-01-04 04:55:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @markshaper @krassenstein @CommonGOPvoter Yes, and polarization can be very dangerous for a country.  I'm down to debate and listen and learn.  That's the only way we can make peace is to find the middle ground.  I consider myself more of a left leaning centrist, these days.
949120801621659649 2018-01-04 03:30:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @markshaper @krassenstein @CommonGOPvoter Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to listen... but most Republicans are not so nice or well educated.
949120681463119872 2018-01-04 03:29:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @markshaper @krassenstein @CommonGOPvoter My God.  O.o
949119848113754113 2018-01-04 03:26:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @markshaper @CommonGOPvoter @krassenstein LOL.  What a Typical Republican.

949117254150557696 2018-01-04 03:16:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @joshtpm @BeecherFulham That... Actually makes sense.  Damn.

949115081408876544 2018-01-04 03:07:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @perlmutations I feel that John Kelly may be first, or soon after first.  KellyAnny Conway is there to stay.  Sarah Huckabee is stuck so far up Trumps orange ass that I don't feel she will ever leave.

949035753572589568 2018-01-04 21:52:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheRickWilson @StuartSpooner Are you suggesting that everything Trump touches dies, but everything Trump tries to kill ends up thriving??  Sure hope this holds up with my healthcare plan.
949034701041360896 2018-01-04 21:47:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SenBobCorker Nobody cares what you have to say anymore, Bob.  At least, not after the #CorkerKickback.
949034425865601024 2018-01-04 21:46:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @letters4trump45 @CAH You guys should retweet this, considering your recent shenanigans.
949034278612029440 2018-01-04 21:46:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @letters4trump45 @Hollybun2 You've already donated with your taxes.  I, personally, do NOT want my tax money building a wall between us and Mexico.  That's ridiculous.  Ever heard of a ladder?

949033672405078018 2018-01-04 21:43:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @letters4trump45 I'm a patriot and I voted NO!
949033542197088256 2018-01-04 21:43:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @letters4trump45 Sounds like most of the people answering this poll do NOT want a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.  Who would have thought?  I mean, I'm surprised.  LOL.

949024525169102849 2018-01-04 21:07:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen You should go research Timothy O'Brien's book "Trump Nation: The Art of Being the Donald" and how @realDonaldTrump blocked it from being published for 10 years with a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.  Definitely worth a read.
949024065729318912 2018-01-04 21:05:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents Hire me.
949023862552965127 2018-01-04 21:04:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @letters4trump45 You mean, "Don't let anybody outside of our echo chamber vote in this poll.  Keep it 100% partisan and don't let anyone else have an opinion."  It really doesn't work that way.  Nice try.
949023585489825793 2018-01-04 21:03:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @letters4trump45 While this may be true, every word spoken by Trump and the GOP divide the nation.

Because I have a difference of opinion suddenly I don't care about my country?  Wow.  That's some pretty intense black & white thinking you've got going on there.  That's very dangerous.
949022507620806657 2018-01-04 20:59:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @letters4trump45 @marynoise You're right.  Otherwise it becomes an echo chamber, and that is dangerous.  Without challenging our views, we become stagnant.

948722924042817541 2018-01-03 01:09:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen Really, only about 10% of that 30% think his word is the word of god.  Many of the others, I feel, may be regetting their decisions at this point.
948684788940058626 2018-01-03 22:37:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @hasanthehun @JordanUhl @winberlygeorge I completely understand your apprehension.  I felt the same.  I rolled the dice, though, and I feel like I won.
948680976636502017 2018-01-03 22:22:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @PCGamesN Nooo!! I just saw this, posted 22m ago, and the codes are already gone!?  *sigh*  LAME!!!
948680232629886976 2018-01-03 22:19:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate It certainly feels like we got a short break for the holidays as the Fuhrer was out golfing... and now that we are all back to work, shit it getting INTENSE already.  I kind of love this.  Feels like things are falling apart, but that may not be the worst thing to happen.
948679741015515136 2018-01-03 22:17:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @hasanthehun @JordanUhl @winberlygeorge You really should turn on the sound.  It's worth it, this time.
948678015613104129 2018-01-03 22:10:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stonekettle Though I am not certain of what is going on with this guy, you get a like for the Blue Oyster Cult reference.  Thanks for that!

948628969091461125 2018-01-03 18:55:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump If @FoxNews is not #1 on the list, followed by Breitbart, then you're a damned liar.
948628668905074688 2018-01-03 18:54:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump Really wish that you gave this same respect to the American people as they try to take the country back from corrupt billionaires and GOP politicians.
948628284656574464 2018-01-03 18:53:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EdKrassen Links? I blocked the orange man.
948604697342042118 2018-01-03 17:19:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @intel @tomshardware There are already benchmarks showing up out there.  Intel screwed up in a big way and has kept it secret for a very long time.
948603684082110469 2018-01-03 17:15:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @funder I was just thinking this.  He's party to treason.
948579488543232000 2018-01-03 15:39:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @GeorgeTakei @hild67 This pictures always leave me in awe.  So beautiful and so terrifying at the same time.  It baffles me that this man can be so cavalier about the world's most destructive weaponry.
948443873742872577 2018-01-02 06:40:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @elonmusk If you help me get a house, I'd relocate.

948302698016800768 2018-01-02 21:19:16 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @chrissyteigen My guess is an award, or something?  Maybe a plaque fit into the back.
948297355257896961 2018-01-02 20:58:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate @thehill @wordlass1 Yeah, I realize this.  Still, it's a beautiful momoment.  I'm here thinking to myself "my report mattered."  Our reports mattered.  Twitter listened.  That's a great step in the right direction.
948295473982595073 2018-01-02 20:50:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> I reported this man's account just yesterday for this abuse, and today his account is suspended.  I love it.  I'm sure I'm not the only one, but this sure feels good.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/948292859555467265
948295304603979776 2018-01-02 20:49:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate @thehill LOL!!! I reported him just yesterday.  You're welcome.
948291091169730560 2018-01-02 20:33:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ByYourLogic Not to be convinced with Kobol, the home of the tomb of Athena.  *snicker*
948290747324825604 2018-01-02 20:31:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ByYourLogic I had to look up Kolob, but oh!  When I did.  :D

948275876214509569 2018-01-02 19:32:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @LoganPaul @UnlimitedSalt @Termin1077 @mostly_logey I don't think you can back-pedal, now. Suddenly caring about suicide victims and saying "suicide is not an option" does not exclude you from being wrong about your defence of Logan Paul in the first place. Suicide is an option for many and belittling it is unacceptable.
948269691428130821 2018-01-02 19:08:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @HiTechWorldNews I have an easier solution... don't buy an iPhone, especially after this fiasco.
948253452244799488 2018-01-02 18:03:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @thehill @consmover @MyDogisHarv Actually, Obama created DACA through an exective order. Trumped ended DACA. Here is a "reliable news source" stating such.http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/20/what-is-daca-and-why-is-trump-administration-ending-it.html

948240546090319872 2018-01-02 17:12:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @drvox I feel there is a strong correlation from these folks to those who subscribe to Breitbart.

947987118621712384 2018-01-01 00:25:16 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JoyAnnReid @Mikel_Jollett Right?  There are some great documentaries out there showing the disproportionate incarceration of African Americans overall, not just for drugs.  Go watch 13 and The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution.  Should be a must for everyone.

947951235625373697 2018-01-01 22:02:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BarackObama @Deplorable_NYC @Sciencegirl60 @Tajalithaca Sounds like he does not enjoy things outside of his echo chamber....  And that they are butthurt about Obama winning their poll.  LoL.
947898212245016577 2018-01-01 18:31:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate @Education4Libs Well, somebody lives in an echo chamber.  ;)

947896181144870912 2018-01-01 18:23:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SenSanders I just wanted to say "Thank you" for everything you are doing in the fight for a real, honest America that is working for the people.

947886732585984000 2018-01-01 17:46:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @UnlimitedSalt @CordyTheSecond Possibly a personality disorder, honestly.  Maybe Narcissism?
947886448941903872 2018-01-01 17:45:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BarackObama @Sciencegirl60 @Tajalithaca While bots may be an issue, you're ignoring the fact that this poll started out in a Trump echo chamber. If you don't know much about echo chambers, look them up. Also, Obama is officially winning the poll at this point. Lookes like thigns backfired for @Deplorable_NYC
947885075202486278 2018-01-01 17:39:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BarackObama @KelleynRon @Deplorable_NYC So far, it looks like your own poll agrees.  Very well done, Mr Deplorable.
947884399852474368 2018-01-01 17:37:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kumailn Nailed it.

I feel everyone is jumping to conclusions.  Please, send real links to the art hanging in his home and show me what you're talking about... because right now all I see is a straw-man case being built.

The date was Oct. 18th 2017.

946178304238858245 2017-12-27 00:37:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @williamlegate It all depends on which echo chamber you belong to.

946155660206596097 2017-12-27 23:07:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ASUSUSA I love most Blizard games, but right now I am playing SCII and LOVING Co-op.  Everything they are doing right now is pretty amazing.

I can't imagine how you feel, being so truly close to Carrie. I only know her through her amazing presence on the screen.  <3  Thanks for sharing, Mr. Hamill.
946089854831489024 2017-12-27 18:46:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CORSAIR @NZXT IT's a great cooler! I have the @Corsair h115i, but they are made from the same parts without the flash. I almost bought the X62, but I bought mine refurbed with a warranty for REALLY cheap (half the price). I plan to buy the X52/X62 and give h115i to my girl later on. Congrats!

945714259664822272 2017-12-26 17:53:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @elonmusk I would ask that you make them affordable to the common man.  I would love a Tesla, but not if I have to choose between that and financing a home for myself.

Any registered news station has to fact check and apologize for spreading falsehoods. @FoxNews gets away with it's bullshit by being officially registered as "entertainment" and not "news."  Go figure, right? They really should crack down on this.

945381049793699840 2017-12-25 19:49:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Razer what does it take to become sponsered and earn my way into a Christmas stocking??  Inquiring minds must know.
945380169937772544 2017-12-25 19:46:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @LibyaLiberty So it's the hijab that perpetuates patriarchial control over women?  And here I thought it was something as simple as perpetuation of systemic misogyny that really kept women from being equals and creating an egalitarian society.  *hmmm*
945379315688050689 2017-12-25 19:42:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @LibyaLiberty LOL!  This is the best thing I've read all day.  Like they feel somehow you are attacking their Christmas and you will be somehow be offended.  This is beautiful.  :)

945327344641826816 2017-12-25 16:16:16 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheRaDR Yeah.  I've read a little, here and there, about rampant sexism in the Jewish community.  I'm sorry to hear this.  It sounds like she is more than qualified and has been skipped over for a man simply because he is a "successful man."
945325436799803392 2017-12-25 16:08:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JohnCleese We don't vote for a president until 2020, sadly.  But, next year we might be able to vote in a Congress with the power to impeach him.

This kind of gives prizes to a niche market that can already easily afford these products.
945007344399867905 2017-12-24 19:04:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Sketchfab @RadeonPro @masterpieceVR @AMDRyzen But, I don't know how to use 3d rendering software.  qq

944816655288422400 2017-12-23 06:26:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @elonmusk Hahaha.  Fact.  Of course, I believe aliens could become a possibility.... But your space-x launch is not it.
944680339951235072 2017-12-23 21:25:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 I buy my windows 7 keys on Ebay. 20 bucks, at the most... and if you wanted, you could upgrade to 10 for free still. Super cheap and I've never had a problem getting them setup. You may have to call Microsoft to validate, but it's worth it for the price. Instant email delivery.
944664261707616257 2017-12-23 20:21:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @tonyposnanski Technically, "dotard" was because of Kim Jong-un.  :D  I absolutely love his word usage.
944648853529210881 2017-12-23 19:20:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @PCGamesN The thing I would add is that Ryzen motherboards are going to be able to be used on the next several generations of Ryzen CPU's.  Intel will require a new motherboard with every CPU release.  Ryzen is much cheaper in this aspect, much more future-proof if you will.
944648041038057472 2017-12-23 19:16:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @PCGamesN Owner of a Ryzen 7 1700x over here, and I absolutely love this processor!  It's fast and can chew through every game I throw at it as well as being faster with many applications.

943907290629005314 2017-12-21 18:13:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SenBobCorker @paradigmeyes I love it when they say something like this. "This was debunked." Okay, so give us the facts, then. Who debunked this idea? Where is the scientific journal that was used to debunk this for you? It's all bullshit and lies.  I almost had faith in Corker at the end, but he betrayed.
943759206842273792 2017-12-21 08:25:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Reuters Yeah, no shit.  They ruined the taxi businesses in my city.  They do not have permits here and should be illegal.

943535077656547328 2017-12-20 17:34:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @PressSec @RogueCPI @EarthSchool @SteveMock1961 @BethShell @CinnadeD You just lost an argument to a girl.  You think she is crazy, cute, and confused, yet she just wiped the floor with your less-than-intelligent face.
943534517729611776 2017-12-20 17:32:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @PressSec @RogueCPI @EarthSchool @SteveMock1961 @CinnadeD @BethShell Wow. He just started using ad hominem fallacies. Good job destoying your own argument, whatever your name is. The moment you start attacking the person and not the problem, you have been defeated. Also, this woman is intelligent and well spoken, not "cute or confused." #Misogyny
943271368547864576 2017-12-19 00:06:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ManKindInit @csmunday @weathagirl @ac2ninebreaker I don't own firearms, and probably never will.  Just not for me.
943271271407767555 2017-12-19 00:06:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday @ManKindInit @bakamonosan @ac2ninebreaker Yeah, you should go research "Japanese Rape Culture."  Their laws and tendencies towards rape are pretty fucked up.
943248946268340225 2017-12-19 22:37:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ManKindInit @csmunday @weathagirl I've also seen women who were abused being forced to see their accusers weekly because they still have custody of their children. It's a twisted world we live in. Also, that means 2/3rd of victims are female. I'm not trying to downplay male victimization, but we have to fix this.
943237387878006786 2017-12-19 21:51:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SarahKSilverman Hey. I just wanted to say that I love everything you are doing for the community at large. Keep up the good fight, Sarah. I kind of wish I knew you in person as I know you in tweet, because I really feel we share a lot of the same values, such as people over politics. #Resist
943235974296989697 2017-12-19 21:45:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday @ManKindInit @bakamonosan DV and sexual assault are not mutually excusive.  It's like a ven diagram overlapping, I'm sure.  They often go hand-in-hand and rape from a partner, or somebody known to the victim, is the most common.
943235316797923328 2017-12-19 21:43:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RealMarkLatham @JimmiDoodle @csmunday Raising our women up and creating an egalitarian society.  Pretty simple concept, really.
943235207196479488 2017-12-19 21:42:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ManKindInit @csmunday @weathagirl I didn't stand by and watch, I called the police.  I was helping physically as she was dating an MMA fighter and I could not hold my own against the man.
943228509215916032 2017-12-19 21:16:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @funder I'm lazy, so I will just share this instead.
943227493783429120 2017-12-19 21:12:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday @ManKindInit @bakamonosan We can talk about both in the same sentence.  Sexual assault can absolutely be a form of domestic violence.  Write out "I will actually debate rather than being smug" about 50 times and then talk to me.
943226874540576769 2017-12-19 21:09:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RealMarkLatham @JimmiDoodle @csmunday You're right, I would never assume to know what it means to have a prejudiced loyalty to one's own gender.  I don't think you know what feminism means.
943226094215458817 2017-12-19 21:06:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday @ManKindInit @bakamonosan You're correct, I was wrong.  It's actually about 2% are false accusations, about the same as other felonies according to the FBI.    https://web.stanford.edu/group/maan/cgi-bin/?page_id=297
943225452868620288 2017-12-19 21:04:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ManKindInit @randonnumber @csmunday I'm a man who has been physically, mentally, and sexually abused and I can tell you that the last thing victims of this type of abuse need to hear is that their pain and trauma is fake and nothing but a lie. That is why the #MeToo movement even exists.
943225289806614528 2017-12-19 21:03:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ManKindInit @randonnumber @csmunday Real feminism looks at both sides of the issue. Telling women they are lying about domestic violence and rape while simultaneous trying to explain to me about how terrible it is that men are also abused is absolute bullshit.
943223724001628162 2017-12-19 20:57:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday @ManKindInit @weathagirl Because women are finally standing up for themselves.  My sister has been the victim of DV multiple times.  The cops would often not believe her, and she had a tendency to return to DV situations.  *shrug*
943223385739485184 2017-12-19 20:55:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RealMarkLatham @JimmiDoodle @csmunday And here comes the chauvanist.  :D
943221714095427585 2017-12-19 20:49:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday @ManKindInit @randonnumber 8-10% being false claims actually lines up with the national average of false claims for ALL other crimes, as well. It's more than a statistical game. Your point of view is exactly why women are not coming forward with their claims. They are afraid of being told they are lying.
943204199571099649 2017-12-19 19:39:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Sapphire @msiUSA @FractalDesignNA @CoolerMaster @AMDRyzen @Garda11B1P My only suggestion to you is that you put that AIO on the front and that 2nd fan on the top as exhaust.  It's proven you will get maybe 5C different in cooling with a push configuration from the front.  :)  But it looks great!  congrats on your build!!
943203166002216960 2017-12-19 19:35:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Hobie_SHRED ROFL!!!!  That post, though.  Brilliant
943201463492333568 2017-12-19 19:28:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @carolynbuerk What the fuck... you mean like when J. Edgar Hoover ordered the killing of Fred Hampton? Hmmm.  I doubt they tried to kill Trump, that's a pretty bold statement from Faux News. Still, it's worth researching COINTELPRO or watching the Black Panther's documentary by PBS on Netflix.
943200063584657408 2017-12-19 19:23:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KamalaHarris This sounds strangely like @SenSanders Presidential platform.  *Hmmm*  I voted for this man in the primaries, but the DNC really gave him the shaft.  Thanks for that, Debbie.  You know who you are.
943199534573867008 2017-12-19 19:21:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday @RealMarkLatham @JimmiDoodle It's funny you say that, because some troll who was trying to start shit with me retweeted this guy's post.  That' show I found all this.  Apparently "reprogramming" myself to become a good man who doesn't abuse women is considered bullshit to these people.  #MeToo
943198047445667841 2017-12-19 19:15:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday @ManKindInit Roughly 9%, or less, turn out to be false claims.  They do, indeed, happen.  That means that at least 91% of sexual assault and harassment claims are true.  You're not looking at the full spectrum of the facts, just cherry picking the one's that fit your agenda.
943197746118516736 2017-12-19 19:14:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday The #MeToo movement is about outting ALL sexual abuse, not just that against women. We are mostly focused on women because the majority of sexual abuse is perpetrated by men, but this does not mean women are not also perpetrators.  You're taking 1 act out of context and twisting.
943196409662201857 2017-12-19 19:08:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday Yeah, and I had a man grab my ass, rub all over me, and grab my nipple at work.  He would also whisper shit into my ears like "I know you're not straight."  Guess what happened to him?  He was fired for sexual harassment.  So yes, sexual assault is sexual assault.
943196048780070912 2017-12-19 19:07:16 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday @RealMarkLatham So, you guys are claiming the Weinstein allegations are fake news?  Wow.  That's intense.
943195801953689601 2017-12-19 19:06:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @csmunday 100% serious. Socialization, which can also be called "social programming," starts at birth. Men are taught to treat women like 2nd class citizens when their place is to stand with us as equals. There are no excuses anymore.
943187442139529217 2017-12-19 18:33:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon @stephenfegely ***not martyrdom***. Not martyrdom AT ALL
943186726352277504 2017-12-19 18:30:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon @stephenfegely Also, just because you ate some acid or had a mystical experience on mdma at an EDM show does not suddenly qualify you to become a sagely mystic able to give what you believe to be "sound advice" because you are suddenly enlightened. You're not Woke AF.
943186185089843201 2017-12-19 18:28:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon @stephenfegely I don't really feel you know what the word "shaman" in your name really means. Rick is a reflection of Dan, not the other way around. This is also martyrdom, it's depression and anxiety. Who are you to judge these things? A shaman would show compassion, not criticism.
943182941559099394 2017-12-19 18:15:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon Drunken Fallout VR?  You realize you're not playing "Roy," don't you?
942982928874786821 2017-12-18 05:00:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Gizmodo That robot looks like Chappie.  Definiltely fake.
942982694442602497 2017-12-18 04:59:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA @crippledscholar You're right.  I feel I am a good man, after much time spent reprogramming myself.  I don't need to shout this from the moutaintops.  Being a good man, I also try to answer the call to arms by calling out my friends who are being abusive.  #NoMoreSilence
942980410266542080 2017-12-18 04:50:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Kanew This is why I am a dirty, dirty socialist at heart.
942977275540238336 2017-12-18 04:37:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheRickWilson I'm not sure this guy understands a single word he is typing.  Ever.
942975356847484930 2017-12-18 04:30:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @paulhardware I'm more than kinda jealous.  :D  I could really use a 1080 or 1080ti for my Ryzen 7 build, otherwise.
942975218607325185 2017-12-18 04:29:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano You forgot CHINA!
942975003649302528 2017-12-18 04:28:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KamalaHarris And next?  The attack on Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.  They want to tap into that 2.5 trillion so badly, and it's driving them nuts that they cannot touch it.
942973765780234240 2017-12-18 04:24:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SenBobCorker We're not afraid that this will is going to be amazing, we see through your bullshit attempt at lining your pockets and how this is going to fuck the middle class.  I'm one of your constituents and I am 100% against the tax bill and the FCC removal of Net Neutrality.
942880558060883968 2017-12-18 22:13:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon Social anxiety?  Yeah, that's a bitch.
942876354592366593 2017-12-18 21:56:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BitspowerHQ @TeamGroupTech @msiUSA @bequietofficial @ScienceStudioYT Going orange would look SICK.  Congrats on an amazing build!!  Do you plan to throw the 1080ti into the loop, as well?
942831643961774080 2017-12-18 18:59:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pablorodas Yes, but if he does.... it may cause a civil uprising.
942807975177216000 2017-12-18 17:25:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jenndangerous Just read this article earlier in the morning. Absolutely brilliant!
942646926482305024 2017-12-17 06:45:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @washingtonpost I've been saying this for an extremely long time.  This goes for ALL auto-immune disorders.  Next, you guys should write about The Elimination Diet.
942645458085859328 2017-12-17 06:39:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @brianstelter @tamaraholder @DanJohnsoninc This is powerful, but she made a mistake... she never should have admitted doing MDMA to treat her PTSD.  People will use that fact against her.  :/  But, it is all going to come out.  She's trying to open the flood gates and I hope it works.
942644089744494592 2017-12-17 06:33:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Gizmodo @TheRickWilson @LAustyanJulian They also got them from the GSA, completely legally.
942642362194497537 2017-12-17 06:27:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @MaureenShaw Let's not forget student's who want to attend grad school.
942635578671157249 2017-12-17 06:00:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ABousquette @RWPUSA Since you have worked as a White House ethics lawyer for Bush Jr., I'm assuming you are a Republican.  Thanks for this post.
942633586691334144 2017-12-17 05:52:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RadioFreeTom Very well said.  I keep a few members of the red team around, but only those who are willing to employ critical thinking and empathy.
942633146205470720 2017-12-17 05:50:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @ABousquette @RepSwalwell Let's be honest, though... I'm willing to bet not many GOP follows are following your Twitter feed.  You're probably in an echo chamber where 98% of the people believe that Trump is a D-bag (which he is).  Just saying, this is a skewed poll.
942533536841596930 2017-12-17 23:14:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @alexkotch I'm sorry, I'm going to need more evidence..... wait.... I can't say that one.
942533160096681984 2017-12-17 23:13:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @geeksandcleats This movie is GREAT!  Why is everyone so angry??
942532693811716096 2017-12-17 23:11:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheOnion My God.
942531645210537986 2017-12-17 23:07:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheRickWilson Nevermind, I found it:  "When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owners consent or appropriate criminal process, Mueller spokesman Peter Carr told CNN." quoted from @Gizmodo.
942530597469216770 2017-12-17 23:03:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheRickWilson Any links to this? I would like to read up on my own about the context of the world "criminal" in this instance.
942513762745110529 2017-12-17 21:56:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio Thanks, Abed.
942511320469000192 2017-12-17 21:46:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JohnLegere @AuntieTashia Perfect, thanks!
942511197932457985 2017-12-17 21:45:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BobbiLParish @RachelintheOC It gets easier, also.  All of it.
942471698464591872 2017-12-17 19:08:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ScienceStudioYT I haven't been sent anything about you having a new video, and I'm subscribed.  Send me a link?
942471004500234240 2017-12-17 19:06:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SenBobCorker @AdyBarkan @LindaGorordo No, I believe this is good ole' fashioned government greed and corruption.
942469987310231557 2017-12-17 19:02:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Kanew Definitely retweeted this one.  Thanks, Justin and Andy.
942469625002057728 2017-12-17 19:00:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JohnLegere I love this.  Any other way to watch it, though?  I don't do facebook anymore.
942448115793227776 2017-12-17 17:35:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Ros3ttasSt0ne I feel as though my tone was lost in this.  I was being a little sarcastic, mostly due to my anger at your situation.  I'm sorry you had to go through this.  Some of us are striving for a better future for all.  I pray you never have to live through something like this again.
942289292361072640 2017-12-16 07:04:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @tonyposnanski It's cool.  Soon our children can take these positions.

942242052804370433 2017-12-16 03:56:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Reuters @LibyaLiberty @Journotopia Retweeted.  Please update this comment thread if they find him.
942241280511414272 2017-12-16 03:53:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RachelintheOC Oh man.  I can't even.  This man has no shame.  :/  Trauma like this never leaves, and every time I see "sexual abuse" written anywhere.... I shut down.  Some people will never understand what it means to be "triggered" and they just make fun of us for being overly sensitive.
942240164348399616 2017-12-16 03:48:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheRaDR This may be weird, but things feel spiritually unclean to me when I neglect housework.  I'm kind of energy sensitive and I can feel it.

942238679728295936 2017-12-16 03:43:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Ros3ttasSt0ne I cannot tell if this situation is more sexist or racist.  On behalf of white men everywhere, I want to apologize.  Damn.  *SMH*
942237599804116992 2017-12-16 03:38:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Reakash Seriously, this is ridiculous treatment.  So you're black and that means a white guy is not going to break into your house?  How... can this even be justified???  I would get a lawyer and press charges on the police for negligence, if I were you.  Again:  What. the. fuck?
942237008856080384 2017-12-16 03:36:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Reakash @aditrao You guys are in Canada, right?  And here I thought we just did this crap in the US.  *SMH*

942147440509145089 2017-12-16 21:40:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @washingtonpost @PaIeodeadlift And this comment makes absolutely 0 sense.
942146859598057472 2017-12-16 21:38:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @washingtonpost @S5Harding No, at this point liking a post is just saying "hey, I read this," or "good reporting."  It has nothing to do with the grisly scene that is being portrayed.
942127982285676544 2017-12-16 20:23:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JeffFlake @SebGorka @colemanbracken Your snark is showing.
942106540022157312 2017-12-16 18:57:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JeffFlake @SebGorka @colemanbracken He owns pictures from Biljana Djurdjevic, but this is not proof that he is a pedophile. AND, he does not have ANY of the images that you posted in his home. These are other pieces from the artist. Go research #pizzagate. You're pulling straight from the conspiracy theory.
942089852513812480 2017-12-16 17:51:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TEAMEVGA @hardwarecanucks I kind of want one of these.  :D
942089019365740544 2017-12-16 17:48:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JeffFlake @SebGorka @colemanbracken Except that NONE of that art is actually hanging in their home.

942077979471089664 2017-12-16 17:04:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano @Rebel9WheelsUp @john_hobo @Hanlon2Hanlon Where did you find this statistic?  I've been sexually harassed by a woman in the workplace in the past.  I am really curious about this one.
941925099845898240 2017-12-15 06:56:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @wwbookclub He's afraid and in denial.  Not evil or ignorant.
941920422613962753 2017-12-15 06:38:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO I disagree.  I thought it was great.  :P  LOL
941917095301967874 2017-12-15 06:25:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @PsychologyDoc Yes, but where is the next big crypto-currency?  I want to cash in on quickly rising investments, but not necessarily the bitcoin train.
941832212789452800 2017-12-15 00:47:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @thehill I feel as though he has a lot to hide.  A LOT.  I'm just wondering how long it is until shit starts coming out about this man, especially with the idea he may retire next year.  One can only dream, for now.

I'm not looking forward to the day that I hvae to pay for Hulu, Netflix, and Steam as seperate streaming "channels."  Also, you just nailed it.  Pai is absolutely part of the problem, at this point.

Believe me, I believe both sides are screwed.  I voted Hillary in the general election, but only because I would have preferred business as usual vs. "the Trump Card" as I like to call it.  It killed me to do so after they screwed Bernie.

I vote for the person with the best message, the best track record, and the best overall position to provide for the common man.  I feel like we may be on the same side, honestly.

941118298921553920 2017-12-13 01:31:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @MikeMadden @TheRaDR This is absolutely hilarious.  I guess we will never truly understand the divine connection between Roy Moore and God.  Too bad, it sounds like a great story.  *snicker*

I was raised Southern Baptist, but I am now reformed.  It's heartbreaking to see Christianity, or any religion, used as a guise for hatred and bigotry.
940996413802074118 2017-12-13 17:26:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Kanew @KellyLGregory Absolutely.  I have no problem with people of faith.  I am the same, though spiritual and not religious.  I feel that many in TN use their faith as a reason to abuse others, and that includes state legislation.  I am 100% against this type of tactic.
940988740893364225 2017-12-13 16:56:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Kanew @KellyLGregory I vote every time, but I feel as though my voice is drowned out by an ever oppressive theocratic agenda that has somehow brainwashed the masses in my state.
940987949583302658 2017-12-13 16:53:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @evansiegfried It's not even worth asking this question.  He is a clinical narcissist and NOTHING he does will ever make sense to a normal person with things like empathy, ya know?
940987121963282438 2017-12-13 16:49:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RandPaul @tedcruz @SenMikeLee @gabrielmalor Ted Cruze was actually smart enough to say he believed the women and Moore should not be in the Senate.  I'm not sure if he backtracked, though.  It has been a couple of weeks since this statement.
940986654529114114 2017-12-13 16:47:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @stevel3000 It's the most in your face and relevant case study the public has ever witnessed.  Quite a sight to behold, really.

940984961846468608 2017-12-13 16:41:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Kanew @KellyLGregory It has felt futile to vote in TN for a long time.  The rural Republican vote just overwhelms us in the cities.  I always wonder how people can vote against their own interests and vehemently abuse those of us who are simply trying to do the right thing, all in the same breath.

940783380681109506 2017-12-12 03:20:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @tonyschwartz Mr. Schwartz, I believe your intuition is on point tonight.  NY Times is calling for Doug Jones to pull out a win.  Thanks for staying so positive through all of this.

940762369390710788 2017-12-12 01:56:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Well, Alabama is starting to look like the scariest place in the country to raise your children.
940761099061915657 2017-12-12 01:51:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @krassenstein Roy Moore leads by 1.8 percentage points over Doug Jones with 5 percent of precincts fully reporting.

940755248108457984 2017-12-12 01:28:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @krassenstein Many of us care, but our hands are tied until the federal government decides to actually do something about him.  It's a sick and twisted world we are living in, right now.  :/

940616691200987137 2017-12-12 16:17:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheRaDR @westeawest You mean, because it's misogynistic, patriarchal, and promotes rape culture for the oligarchs?
940616422463541248 2017-12-12 16:16:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheRaDR I'm all about the rising egalitarian society.  Also, I did not ask for white privilege.  I was shocked when I learned this is actually a legitimate thing.  Maybe it's because I come from poverty, but I did not see it until I retrained my brain and started looking for it.
940468084908883968 2017-12-11 06:27:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @tonyschwartz Steve Bannon knows he is repugnant and wants the empire to fall.  Trump's psychosis prevents him from realizing he has a problem.  You decide which is more evil.

Nah, we're not talking about that.  We're talking about the numberous women Trump has kissed, tried to kiss, or grabbed by the pussy without their consent.
940307952157814785 2017-12-11 19:51:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @krassenstein We call these people "Yellow Dog Republicans," because you could place a yellow dog in front of them and they would vote for the dog above a Democrat.   I know, it's isane, but this is the reality we are fighting against.

939975143845171202 2017-12-10 21:48:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump The really SAD thing is that you cannot actually back up this claim with picture or video proof, yet there are thousands of pictures and videos catching you in lies and deceit.  SAD, indeed.

939625769667571712 2017-12-09 22:40:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA @HeerJeet So, they can accept these allegations and attempt to explain them in such as way as to make them socially acceptable.  Wow, Alabama.  I know exactly where I do not want to raise my children.

I ordered the new holiday cards, but I was not in the running for a refund on this glorious day of wealth inequality redistrubution. I feel it is an amazing move on your part, but I am drowing in student and medical debt and I lost my job last month.

They literally do not possess the cognitive function to understand you.  It's outside of their intelligence.
939503859168407552 2017-12-09 14:35:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @PinkNews @RachelintheOC Holy fucking holidays, Batman.  This is blatant.  When Trump lost the court case for having the letter "C" for colored applicants in his apartments, he called it a great victory.  He's always been this way.  It's blatant after 5 minutes of research.  1-2 Google searches away.

939302133819695104 2017-12-08 01:14:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> You do realize that Breitbart support neo-nazis, right? Actually, I'm sure you do.

937910613321437184 2017-12-04 05:04:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KamalaHarris To answer my own question, quoted from Forbes:  "Social Security has a trust fund, and that trust fund is supposed to have $2.6 trillion in it, according to the Social Security trustees."
937910360354574336 2017-12-04 05:03:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KamalaHarris I've left over here wondering how much money is actually stashed in Social Security.  Why do they want to gut it so badly?  It has to be, at the LEAST, many billions of dollars.

This is how you get a 1-party system.
937400566053003264 2017-12-03 19:18:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DankMemesCrew Well, this is officially the most misogynistic thing I've seen on the internet today.  Congratulations!  You lost a follower.
937388831141171201 2017-12-03 18:31:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pattonoswalt @JoyAnnReid You know, Trump considered this ruling to be a "great victory" even though he lost.  It was the first time in public that you start to see his complete disregard for POC and his narcissistic inability to accept defeat.
937387680232607744 2017-12-03 18:26:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @xychelsea What this guy doesn't understand is that the SCOTUS ruled that freedom of speech does not cover intolerance.  It's the one exception.
937386990869336065 2017-12-03 18:24:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Type1Warrior @Just_SomeChick @219112 If you ban politcal parties then you end up with a 1 party system.  That's not a good idea, at all.

937374591323967488 2017-12-03 17:34:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pattonoswalt This exchange will never stop being comedy gold.  "Toxic masculinity battles it out with world renowned comedian."  Can this become a reality show?
937373824064081921 2017-12-03 17:31:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Type1Warrior @Just_SomeChick @219112 I disagree that they should make nothing.  I do believe that there should be checks and balances on their raises, though.  And lobbying should be a crime.
937372661575045122 2017-12-03 17:27:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pattonoswalt I wonder if these wonderful tactics for winning an argument are in his book?  I'm guessing it's the chapter on "never lose, even when you've been horribly defeated!"
937372221026242561 2017-12-03 17:25:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Kanew Bob Corker was the ONLY Republican senator to hold out.  I live in TN and I despise most of what this man does, but now that he is not worries about reelection, he's going out with a fucking bang!
937371647304175617 2017-12-03 17:23:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Type1Warrior @Just_SomeChick @219112 I don't mind them making some money to do their jobs, but I believe lobbying should be stopped as well as insane superpac campaign donations.  Also, they should not be able to vote on their own raises.  That's deplorable.
937370512262561792 2017-12-03 17:18:40 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @drvox I love it when people claim to take the educational high ground but do not know the difference between simple words like "a" or "an" while belittling you in the same breath.

937368145504989187 2017-12-03 17:09:16 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pattonoswalt @Just_SomeChick @perspectivator This book title makes him look like a clinical narcissist or a sociopath.  He probably thinks he is always right.  Using toxic masculinity and fake news as talking points to promote this trash is pathetic.
937367848061677569 2017-12-03 17:08:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @greggutfeld the title of your book makes you sound like a sociopath.
937367550501015552 2017-12-03 17:06:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pattonoswalt You're being targeted because you have emotions regarding the facts contained within a horrendous bill??  Congrats on perpetuating toxic masculinity as a hidden agenda contained within your version of fake news.  You are the problem.

937059066421051392 2017-12-02 20:41:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA I feel like democratic socialism seems to be the best working form of government, but there are always oligarchs.
937044795901562885 2017-12-02 19:44:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @MaxTemkin @blippoblappo That's funny, because all of the Dems voted against this bill.
937042797739339776 2017-12-02 19:36:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA It feels like the same old bullshit, to me. It's what Karl Marx warned us about when we started working within capitalist systems. The guys on top get everything while those on the bottom fight over the rest. The guys on the top become doctors, the rest of us work food service.
937040124583579648 2017-12-02 19:25:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA I just went back to school with the intention of going through grad school when I am finished with my undergrad.  Just found out this morning that I will not have to pay taxes on any tuition reduction I am offered during grad programs.  Screw good grades, I may not afford it now.
937005252351594498 2017-12-02 17:07:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pattonoswalt Sounds like you have a little something called "empathy." It seems to be lacking in pretty much all of the GOP. You cannot put a price on human life.
936833303541268482 2017-12-01 05:43:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano Same.  Fuming.

936645839610630144 2017-12-01 17:19:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @tonyschwartz Please, tell me more!  :)
936574092278468608 2017-12-01 12:33:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JohnCleese Nailed it!
936476860019609600 2017-11-30 06:07:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @GOP @Redpainter1 I'm right there with you.

936474671721123840 2017-11-30 05:58:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> She is the worst.  Marsha Blackburn is one of the worst members of our TN government.  Despicable.  She is paid off by telecom companies.  She knows exactly what she is doing, @SarahKSilverman.
936473814631936001 2017-11-30 05:55:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AjitPaiFCC @MarshaBlackburn Marsha, I live in TN and will vote against you and Andy Holy at every available opportunity.
936466804058320896 2017-11-30 05:27:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DadoftheDecade Scratch that, I just got through.
936466348909252608 2017-11-30 05:25:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DadoftheDecade Tried calling Bob Corker all day and the line was busy.
936465871312162816 2017-11-30 05:23:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @tonyschwartz It's called mob mentality, or an echo chamber effect.  Basically, surrounding yourself with people who share beliefs and do not accept challenges to those concepts.  It's black and white thinking, which is very dangerous.  No room for the gray talk of real compromise.
936369617446035456 2017-11-30 23:01:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AMDGaming Thanks for sponsoring!  Long time Res Team member, at least since my first Phenom ll build.  Any chance you guys would give away swag packs in the future??
936357134807322624 2017-11-30 22:11:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @lvng4chrst I live in Tennessee, for the record.  East Tennessee.  We almost became our own state in the civil war, but the men carrying the papers of secession from the South were caught and hung as Union spies.
936352920026705920 2017-11-30 21:55:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jimmykimmel @roywoodjr @rhythmicalexile That was pretty fucking epic.
936352782696747009 2017-11-30 21:54:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jimmykimmel @lawyer4animals @JRohaus Hmmm.  I worked for people from Alabama, once.  Never again.  It's the one state in the South that even the South won't claim.  Mississippi is a close second.
936346746875195392 2017-11-30 21:30:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KamalaHarris I have been trying to call @SenBobCorker ALL DAY and their line has been set to give a busy signal LITERALLY ALL DAY!!  I'm furious about this and net neutrality, but I cannot even call my Senator and let him know how I feel...  Disappointing, but not unexpected AT ALL.
936346342376595456 2017-11-30 21:28:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @MeetAnimals I should not be laughing at these poor, terrified kitties... but I am, SO HARD!
936291435200032769 2017-11-30 17:50:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> The worst gift I ever gave was a package of Tic-Tacs.  I don't have a photo from the event, but I hope this random stock photo will suffice!  @AMDGaming #AMDHolidealsContestpic.twitter.com/R6axxaXVt7
936288710680817664 2017-11-30 17:39:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @christinawilkie @impulse_random @sherrydeatrick Hell, even minimum wage is not enough to sustain yourself on a basic needs basis.
936287886718140416 2017-11-30 17:36:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA Damn, @perlmutations, this is absolutely savage!  I'm one of those with 75k or less... and I am on board.  Calling my senator today to voice my disgust about the new tax bill and the revocation of net neutrality!
936287007025848321 2017-11-30 17:33:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pattonoswalt @saladinahmed Don't buy into this paranoid rhetoric.  Roy Moore is just pulling the same old GOP game of "blame it all on the Democrats!"  Alabama is just dumb enough to eat it up.
936286538589245440 2017-11-30 17:31:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Razer That's easy.  It will happen when DC's movie franchise fails and Disney buys them.
936286246380494855 2017-11-30 17:30:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @theKos That's awesome.  I had no idea.

936058805053526016 2017-11-29 02:26:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @washingtonpost What, Malthusian Theory???  Sounds about right...
936058445672992768 2017-11-29 02:24:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KamalaHarris You should go research Malthusian Theory.  ;)
936058237480325125 2017-11-29 02:24:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon Are you from "the south?"  I recognize that vernacular.  :P

936043909960097792 2017-11-29 01:27:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CoolerMaster Yes.  With enough RGB lighting to illuminate a small rural town, I absolutely turn my PC off at night.  I even turn off the switch to my PSU.

935574986928087041 2017-11-28 18:23:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @paulhardware I just want smooth 4k on a monitor and video card.  Where can I find this!?
935574069449252864 2017-11-28 18:20:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @paulhardware I feel as though the mission is just, but these actions are not.  People can easily become the oppressor, even when they are working for a good cause.  Ever heard of "Bernie Bros?"  Same thing, different subject.
935552812360007680 2017-11-28 16:55:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Microsoft @bitwitkyle @paulhardware Hahahahahaha!!!   Fact.
935552384108986370 2017-11-28 16:54:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @iamthem00s3 LoL.
935416016787648512 2017-11-27 07:52:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon This is the best thing I have seen on the internet in at least a week.
935409645098881024 2017-11-27 07:26:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @bitwitkyle Bluetooth speakers for jams.... And my Samsung Nook.  Used to have a Kindle, but I got tired of the Amazon market.  And before anyone calls me out, I know he said "single piece of tech," but depending on the nature of the trip, I may pick one or the other.
935175719008776198 2017-11-27 15:57:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KamalaHarris @William71853462 That's not true.  I've been making the climb out of poverty and I absolutely pay taxes.
934919539963416576 2017-11-26 22:59:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPC @adslgate @PCPartPicker @Logitech @CORSAIR @ZOWIEbyBenQUSA @Razer @ASUS_ROG @ASUS @NZXT @bin7mran So, it looks like you're going to have a really sweet setup.  Congrats on your first build, man!
934919302657998850 2017-11-26 22:58:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ragegamingz_z @FreeMemesKids @numbcorns @MikeySpinoza I get those feels.  Desensitization due to crappy humans is undestandable.
934918926844289025 2017-11-26 22:56:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FreeMemesKids @EnderGeneral149 @DELT4xDRE4Mz Nope.  I just believe in tasteful acts of human kindness.
934918783860400129 2017-11-26 22:56:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SIRENENT Reported.
934918389415497728 2017-11-26 22:54:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SIRENENT Oh yeah, definitely a narcissist or sociopath.  Thanks for making it glaringly obvious.
934915459471888384 2017-11-26 22:43:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AOC_Gaming @ZakairSevenfold LoL.  You're probably right.  I'll just take my copy of PUBG back to my troll cave and enjoy it with the millions of other players who actually like the game.
934915049008836610 2017-11-26 22:41:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FreeMemesKids @EnderGeneral149 Glad we can find a peaceful consensus.  Thanks for being open and listening.  :)
934914738789732354 2017-11-26 22:40:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPC @adslgate @PCPartPicker @Logitech @CORSAIR @ZOWIEbyBenQUSA @Razer @ASUS_ROG @ASUS @NZXT @bin7mran Very nice!  I hate that they lost the package...  Have you contacted @FedEx directly?
934914464142561283 2017-11-26 22:39:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ragegamingz_z @FreeMemesKids @numbcorns @MikeySpinoza For me, it's PTSD.  To be "triggered" means to have a stress reaction, often physical/chemical, unavoidable, and unexpected.  In this case, I had already seen a violent video posted from this account and then saw this fake video and lost it all over again.
934913904060268544 2017-11-26 22:36:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SIRENENT Also, my sister and I have always owned pitbulls.  She also has 5 children.  They have never been bitten.  Not. One. Time.
934913715387944960 2017-11-26 22:36:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SIRENENT And that concludes this round of "Spot the Sociopath." Thanks for playing, everyone!
934874704233598976 2017-11-26 20:01:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AOC_Gaming @ZakairSevenfold You seem as though this issue is making you very angry.  It is, in the end, just a game.  Please, tell us more about how upset it makes you that PUBG isn't being developed quickly enough.
934874266029391873 2017-11-26 19:59:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPC @adslgate @PCPartPicker @Logitech @CORSAIR @ZOWIEbyBenQUSA @Razer @ASUS_ROG @ASUS @NZXT @bin7mran Also, I feel you are going to want NZXT Hue+ in the future rather than the Phanteks LED strips.  Unless that motherboard has individual led programming, the strips will be 1 solid color.  My Crosshair VI Hero does not.
934873923069636608 2017-11-26 19:58:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPC @adslgate @PCPartPicker @Logitech @CORSAIR @ZOWIEbyBenQUSA @Razer @ASUS_ROG @ASUS @NZXT @bin7mran What CPU?  I don't see it in the pic?
934872917955039234 2017-11-26 19:54:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @cpafcpa Congrats!  This literally spammed up my timeline for got knows how many messages.  Unfollowed.
934872470452101120 2017-11-26 19:52:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @HP @AMDRyzen No thanks, I build my own.  Also, I will never own another HP product.  They are engineered to fail.
934872164976812037 2017-11-26 19:51:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FreeMemesKids @EnderGeneral149 You know, you're right.  It does look doctored and fake.  BUT, other posts from this same page show real world events where people were killed and it's making fun of those situations.  That's no good.
934871744908791808 2017-11-26 19:49:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ragegamingz_z @FreeMemesKids @numbcorns @MikeySpinoza I get that, but it's not up to you to police my emotions.  My sentivities are valid.  My anger is valid.  You do not get to decide when I feel anger or how I express it.  I feel I have shown a healthy and positive view of my anger and feelings, so don't hate on it.
934870907000147968 2017-11-26 19:46:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AOC_Gaming @ZakairSevenfold I guess the term "open beta" must be something beyond your comprehension.
934842078516916229 2017-11-26 17:51:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FreeMemesKids @EnderGeneral149 That dog is obviously terrified and you don't know what could happen when they try to land.  That animal is being dangled above the ground at dangerous heights facing OBVIOUS harm.
934840649513304064 2017-11-26 17:45:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @saletan @EdPlunkett BUT HER EMAILS!?  LOL
934839803824234496 2017-11-26 17:42:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @iamthem00s3 @KayPikeFashion This turned out so well!   I LOVE it!
934828899065884674 2017-11-26 16:59:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA @MuslimIQ Honestly, if you read the BBC article on the changes the Saudi Prince is trying to make, it's pretty progressive.  Of course, I have yet to read either NY Post article, but they may be next.
934821492403130369 2017-11-26 16:29:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FreeMemesKids This is animal abuse, also.  WTF you guys?
934821238572290048 2017-11-26 16:28:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pepeanddoge @FreeMemesKids Framing abuse toward children in a "funny meme."  Good job, you are what is wrong with the planet.
934820839069048833 2017-11-26 16:27:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pepeanddoge Not really.  People actually died in that crash.  I don't mind protecting my sensitivities from gratuitous violence.  I have PTSD and I am at peace with this decision.
934820128209895426 2017-11-26 16:24:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @iamthem00s3 I don't really know you guys, but I know toxic masculinity when I see it... Those responses from people are a "poster child" case of just that.  Saying "that's hurtful" should garner sympathy, not toxicity.
934818883659272192 2017-11-26 16:19:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KayPikeFashion @iamthem00s3 Hey guys!  could one of you follow me so I can privately join the "Cyborg" conversation?  I have a thought I feel the two of you may appreciate.  ;)
934814940317315073 2017-11-26 16:03:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BunMira @KayPikeFashion @GoldenLassoGirl It's called "white washing" not "white face" and it is absolutely a problem.
934808863026663426 2017-11-26 15:39:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ragegamingz_z @FreeMemesKids @numbcorns Having empathy and sensitivity does not equate weakness.
934683946540990465 2017-11-25 07:23:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio Same.

934542115362803712 2017-11-25 21:59:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TIME @SIRENENT First, lockjaw is not a mental retardation.  It's not even real.  Second, it's "known" not "none."  Please learn to use the language correctly.  Third, pitbulls are not actually known for being mentally handicapped.  We actually call it handicapped, not retarded.
934541214686351362 2017-11-25 21:56:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TIME @jeremy_daggett Not nearly as many attacks as you think.
934538692710031360 2017-11-25 21:46:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ASUSUSA Why tweet this again?  Looks like your promotion is over?
934501356492214273 2017-11-25 19:17:40 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ragegamingz_z @FreeMemesKids Yeah.  After seeing the car plow into people, you've earned an unfollow.  Cheers!

932797353748201474 2017-11-20 02:26:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TheStagmania @6Perch I mean, this election proved that the worst representative men could conjure (misogynistic, sexually deviant, narcissistic, etc.) was more important that one of the strongest candidates women could present. Man > Woman, according to this decision.

932776247729500160 2017-11-20 01:02:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @xychelsea It's all about free labor.  Everyone should load Netflix and watch the documentary "13th."  It's quite enlightening when it comes to the numbers of folks we have incarcerated in the US.

924746864444010502 2017-10-29 21:16:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kumailn @danharmon @marconiplein While this is true, you must remember that Trump was formed by years of neglect and abuse. He is both the victim and the victimizer.
924746398259728384 2017-10-29 21:14:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kumailn @danharmon I kind of love how you point back to Freud's proverbial "mommy" in this. It's true. He's calling out to the parental support he never had.

924398526762835969 2017-10-28 22:12:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents Awww.  Jay, that's terribly sad. Lost mom last year, so I know those feels. My only advise: it never goes away, but it gets easier.
924355894539931648 2017-10-28 19:23:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @UltraLinx I was going to say "that is one cool setup!" and then it hit me like a large ocean wave.

924294474796273664 2017-10-28 15:19:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stranger_Things Wow. Just, wow. So many great scenes! So much action! So many plot twists! This season has been worth the wait!!!
924290468619354112 2017-10-28 15:03:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IAmJeffEmmerson You mean, such as abuse trauma, neglect, and an unhealthy attachment to electronics?  My, my, my... I never thought I would see the day.

924151146721218560 2017-10-27 05:49:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @MensHealthMag You know, the EASIEST way to remove skin tag is using tea tree oil.  A little on a cotton ball used in a circular motion every day.  #EZPZ
924150669099044864 2017-10-27 05:47:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @carolynbuerk Wow.  Honestly, not surprising, but just fucking wow.  o.O
924138217410125824 2017-10-27 04:58:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stranger_Things Well, that's one fan theory down.  011 is not the monster.  That is all.  :D  #bingewatching
924132606203097089 2017-10-27 04:35:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Stranger_Things When the bard screws up in a big way.  It's always a fun way to progress the story, but it usually screws up EVERYTHING.

924049463680929793 2017-10-27 23:05:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO I've already watched the first episode and a half before class this morning.  Theme song is playing in my head RIGHT NOW!
924013917755576331 2017-10-27 20:44:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 I would seriously buy this.
924013721042739200 2017-10-27 20:43:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 This is really great!  Man of many talants, and all that.  :D
924013185497264128 2017-10-27 20:41:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @wwbookclub @CountCabbage @sohailaelkhatib @FannyMargret I feel it was emphasizing his lack of empathy and a little foreshadowing toward the reveal that he is not the real Madeye Moody.
924012838628347904 2017-10-27 20:40:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @pottermore @wwbookclub But Moody did not use illegal curses in class. It was Barty Crouch Jr. pretending to be Madeye Moody!
924012378563534850 2017-10-27 20:38:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eberantony @Ezilkannan It's okay.  Sometimes emotional emphasis gets lost when translationing to text.
923934492603174915 2017-10-27 15:28:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eberantony @Ezilkannan Don't be snarky!  Everyone has an opinion and it has all been very helpful!  :D

923769978708529152 2017-10-26 04:35:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DrDisRespect Blueballs?
923769802866544641 2017-10-26 04:34:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eberantony @Ezilkannan Thanks, that's exactly what I'm wondering.  Do you feel the next round of gpus will probably fit the bill?
923744301842096129 2017-10-26 02:52:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eberantony @Ezilkannan So... Should I wait for next gen?  I'm running a 960 right now.  It would give me time to save.
923669968591441920 2017-10-26 21:57:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @Team_Trump45 Bots are back.
923669854221225984 2017-10-26 21:57:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump You mean "save our racism," right?
923668702406508544 2017-10-26 21:52:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eberantony 64?
923583005767200778 2017-10-26 16:12:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @LIRIK @SayNoToRage @urboinemo Pretty sure.  Portal 3 would also be awesome!!

923365668963192834 2017-10-25 01:48:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio Lol.  Figures.  Nobody wants to put in the time and effort.
923365300531277824 2017-10-25 01:46:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EventsGgf @Radeon @Deepcoolglobal @AMDRyzen @Dj_Niner That's what I'm feeling.  Considering a closed look, so maybe MSI/Corsair Poseidon or something.
923350220318105605 2017-10-25 00:47:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @lolrenaynay Again, Verizon customer service is terribad.  Sucks that Google won't let you add a protection plan after the fact, though.  :/
923347229674483717 2017-10-25 00:35:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @lolrenaynay Google should be able to work around that, somehow.  Have you contacted them directly?  Verizon's customer service blows.
923343727967555589 2017-10-25 00:21:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT @SmugDaBeast But, I actually enjoy the tedium of building my own PCs.  :D  Just saying.
923343546270273537 2017-10-25 00:20:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AMDRyzen @Bellavate @ORIGINPCCEO Also, wanting to put together my first custom loop. Going to take the tough route and use hard tubing, as well. I need 10 grand.  :D
923325194332188673 2017-10-25 23:07:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Running Prime95 stress test on my Ryzen 7 1700x and I it can still multi-task well enough to surf, stream, tweet, etc. without lagging.
923316471261954060 2017-10-25 22:32:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FATAL1TY @ASRockInfo @CoolerMaster @NZXT @Radeon @Oneyouhate1 @JonathanSaletri Have a link?  Also, how doe sit perform compared to the 1080 or 1080ti?  I'm looking for 4k graphics as close to ultra as possible.
923312048573960192 2017-10-25 22:15:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio This.  Hilarious.  This is why we just keep tubesocks.  It's "renewable" and "sustainable," right?  At least nobody will ever.... wait.
923311745405538304 2017-10-25 22:14:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Bellavate @ORIGINPCCEO Man, I want to upgrade to 4k so badly.  Just short the GPU and monitor with my @AMDRyzen 1700x.  Saving for the other components, now.
923301733081554944 2017-10-25 21:34:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @tedlieu I've been saying this for a very, very long time.

923296254787858432 2017-10-25 21:12:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SamiraAhmedUK Her here we see the perfect example of systemic racism.  I bet they did not even realize they were doing it.
923294568866394114 2017-10-25 21:05:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @LinusTech Whatcha minin'?

923291861438959616 2017-10-25 20:55:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jk_rowling I'm with you.  I feel this line of thinking, and this illustration, are the exact opposite of the obvious truth.  
923291186764369920 2017-10-25 20:52:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @davidmackau @BacchusFan @LadyofWolves @IngeborgRakvag @TezNyc @voteblue16 @sapienist @giomartezgio In fact, I would say at least 3 million more than those who voted for Trump, if you want to look at the popular vote.
923291089775316993 2017-10-25 20:52:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @davidmackau @BacchusFan @LadyofWolves @IngeborgRakvag @TezNyc @voteblue16 @sapienist @giomartezgio Don't lump the sum of American intelligence in with Donald Trump.  Many of us are very intelligent.
923290464257740800 2017-10-25 20:49:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eberantony So, not a fan of Vega?  Looking to buy a 1080 or 1080ti, myself.  Wanting 4k gaming at my fingertips.
923261249122643969 2017-10-25 18:53:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FAIRImmigration Why am I seeing your page?  Sad. thanks.

923015202853019648 2017-10-24 02:35:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @whYn0Tx @TokyoVimto It's overkill, but you will be able to play @ 4k on Ultra settings on every game available to date.

922923924802826241 2017-10-24 20:33:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 Really?  I thought it was always one of the bigger releases for Xbox.  *shrug*
922908232607256576 2017-10-24 19:30:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 Because it's backed by Microsoft, I'm sure.  I did not like the first Destiny and refused to buy into the hype.  What else do you play?
922904772809822211 2017-10-24 19:16:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Newegg @AMDGaming @AMD @Devin_AM DAAMN!! You got a KILLER deal on that board!  You just payed less for an x370 Taichi than you would for most x350 boards!  Congrats!
922904215869181952 2017-10-24 19:14:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Newegg @AMDGaming @AMD @Devin_AM How much did you pay on sale?  It's a SWEET board!  Pretty much neck + neck with the C6H, as far as power goes.
922903241620381697 2017-10-24 19:10:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Newegg @AMDGaming @AMD @Devin_AM Tag me when you show off your new build. :D

922902804083159040 2017-10-24 19:09:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @EventsGgf @Radeon @Deepcoolglobal hey @AMDRyzen, What Vega card should I buy for the best 4k gaming experience?
922902396547883008 2017-10-24 19:07:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @amazon @bitwitkyle That's got to be a mistake. What the hell are you ordering, a private jet?
922902151105597440 2017-10-24 19:06:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO I kinda want to get a 32" 4k monitor.  Any suggestions?  Also, would you get Vega or a 1080?
922860710664732672 2017-10-24 16:21:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SteveYurko @ZenMonkeyStudio I dig it. And I will send her a follow when you can tag her.  ;)
922854607432413184 2017-10-24 15:57:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 "I guess I just didn't have any coffee."  lol.
922852930776109058 2017-10-24 15:50:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 Ouch.  I just bought a 1700x.  LOL.
922852222387572736 2017-10-24 15:48:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano I would say this number is pretty low.  We don't report it because we are told "you cannot be raped, you're a man, you always want sex."
922849022871826432 2017-10-24 15:35:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @billyeichner @Andy But this issue has almost nothing to do with guns and everything to do with a touch and emotion deprived male society in the USA.  Fact.
922848316551057410 2017-10-24 15:32:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BlackBerry @eberantony Uhm.  They still make blackberries?  LOL!
922839324424654848 2017-10-24 14:56:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 @eberantony They are***  Gotta love typos you cannot edit.  :D  I just woke up.  ;)
922838871624306689 2017-10-24 14:55:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @UN_Women I feel left out on this one.  #MeToo
922838437803196416 2017-10-24 14:53:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano It's honestly kind of terrifying that this is allowed to continue, and is even perpetuated by people who have the power to stop it.
922838299395411968 2017-10-24 14:52:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano It was swept under the rug, and I know I am not the only one this has happened to.  I feel like sharing my story may help others.  #MeToo
922838067882397697 2017-10-24 14:51:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano I feel I was left alone with him again because I am a man.  Our bosses never reported him to the state, so he still practices massage.
922837655204827136 2017-10-24 14:50:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano Management left me in the building with him while they were getting manicures at a nail salon next door and he touched me again.
922837455967084544 2017-10-24 14:49:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano He is also still a licensed massage therapist.  I left that place of employment and found another job.  I no longer felt safe.
922837300740059136 2017-10-24 14:48:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano I was sexually harassed by a fellow co-worker this past year.  He would not stop when I said "no."  He was allowed to quit without backlash.
922836674991869952 2017-10-24 14:46:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano I looks like they are collecting all the #MeToo stories, not just the one's from women.  I'm glad to hear this.  Thanks for sharing.
922832953721409537 2017-10-24 14:31:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eberantony Hahaha!  Part of the reason I enjoy the videos you and @Dimitry49 produce are your voices. Also, they aesthetically pleasing.
922832291163983875 2017-10-24 14:28:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio I plan on ordering your Zen Rick pin sometime soon.  Love your work!

922669184403861505 2017-10-23 03:40:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @xychelsea @Tommyschooley2 you look like a bot.  Are you Russian?
922660160841150465 2017-10-23 03:04:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TINARAES @grethix Want.
922659587836272640 2017-10-23 03:02:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT @drutarg Oh man, sweet!  Congrats on the new case!  GL with your build!
922628182477561856 2017-10-23 00:57:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT @drutarg Let me know if you want to get rid of that s340 elite. ;)
922620592947449857 2017-10-23 00:27:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CORSAIR @bitwitkyle Yeah, I was hoping to see somebody showing them off.  How is the interface programming?  Better than CAM?
922616106799509504 2017-10-23 00:09:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @abbysmardon @unrwausa @kalpenn, You're one of my heros. Just want you to know. I love the philanthropic work I keep seeing on my twitter feed.  Thank you.

922614380524646400 2017-10-23 00:03:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Phanteks @mMaresca_ Nah, that's not a waste.  Get an @NZXT Kraken x52 or x62.  Aesthetically pleasing and great for Ryzen 7 or Coffee Lake.  Intel runs hot btw.
922613975367475200 2017-10-23 00:01:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CORSAIR @worldoftanks Want.
922613488094273536 2017-10-23 23:59:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @HeyMarkL My Pixel 1 screen is still amazing.  Just saying.
922613271445700608 2017-10-23 23:58:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TINARAES My god, I want some swag.  :D  LOL.
922613176881082368 2017-10-23 23:58:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @paulhardware Pump trouble??
922612990305816576 2017-10-23 23:57:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents Daaaamn.  Ouch.  The hell did you pull that off, Jay?
922542317801746432 2017-10-23 19:16:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Twitch @TINARAES Retweeted, but forgot to follow.  Just fixed that.
922529755789918209 2017-10-23 18:26:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Twitch @TINARAES Want!
922455606774108160 2017-10-23 13:32:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 What is this OnePlus 5?
922455083815759877 2017-10-23 13:30:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @elonmusk @ORIGINPCCEO Shots fired.   
922454539265105921 2017-10-23 13:27:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO They have finally gone too far.
922449248771346432 2017-10-23 13:06:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 Look at all that perfect skin.  :D
922284590294863873 2017-10-22 02:12:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @elgatogaming @CORSAIR @AOC_Gaming You make something similar 32" and 4k?  Looking to buy a new monitor and gpu soon.  Torn between Freesync and G-sync.
922283624883478528 2017-10-22 02:08:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Pinterest @carolynbuerk That's a brilliant point. Why change if the profit margin is not shifting? Typical beauracratic thinking. It's a shame.
922283050477768704 2017-10-22 02:06:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @HHSGov @Alyssa_Milano We should be social justice buddies.  Just saying.
922282531331985413 2017-10-22 02:04:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Alyssa_Milano Isn't this illegal?  Unconstitutional even?  I bet their argument is that "they are not covered by the constitution as illegal immigrants."
922282224287961088 2017-10-22 02:03:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @carolynbuerk Perhaps it's a matter of educating the platform? Or bringing their attention to the social problem in question? Thanks for sharing.
922282030586564608 2017-10-22 02:02:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @carolynbuerk The fact that it is a paid add proves, perhaps, that they are not filtering their content for this type of issue.  Good point.
922280931725053957 2017-10-22 01:58:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> #StreamOnIntel Those high single core speeds.  Love it.
922280250188423168 2017-10-22 01:55:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @carolynbuerk I don't feel social media like pinterest proliferates these images. We do. Yes, it's a social problem, but pinterest only reflects our posts
922274782984491008 2017-10-22 01:33:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Phanteks @NZXT @mMaresca_ I feel the h440 for the Intel since you will HAVE to liquid cool it.  Hell, put liquid on both.  :D  Let me know what you decide.
922274557041537024 2017-10-22 01:32:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FATAL1TY @ASRockInfo @CoolerMaster @NZXT @Radeon @Oneyouhate1 Yes, but from the benchmarks I have seen the 1080 and 1080ti outperform. Also, I see it's nearly impossible to get a Vega @ MSRP.
922273823998857221 2017-10-22 01:29:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BoJackHorseman @ZenMonkeyStudio Well, this is bloody terrifying.  :D
922273576866246656 2017-10-22 01:28:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AOC_Gaming @elgatogaming @CORSAIR What monitor is that?
922262511822557184 2017-10-22 00:44:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> This.  please post followup!https://twitter.com/GioakG/status/922249501670301696
922262404158894081 2017-10-22 00:44:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 Could you fix the greens through filter?
922262187380527105 2017-10-22 00:43:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Razer What monitor is that?
922262033965502466 2017-10-22 00:42:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FATAL1TY @ASRockInfo @CoolerMaster @NZXT @Radeon Built a Ryzen 7 1700x rig recently. Want 4k gaming. Thinking of a 1080 or 1080ti. Why should I buy Radeon?  Sell me.
922261734550855680 2017-10-22 00:41:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @oneplus @initialfocus That's cool and all, but my Pixel is still a CHAMP.  Also, it's the Pixel 2 XL with the real issues, the Pixel 2 is great IMHO.
922260837833854976 2017-10-22 00:38:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @GioakG @alexdobie Ouch!
922260595382112256 2017-10-22 00:37:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NVIDIAGeForce @Razer Done, and done!
922260486887837696 2017-10-22 00:36:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO Here's to hoping you mail me a swag bag.  lol.  :P  Glad you had a good time!
922252845558239232 2017-10-22 00:06:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TechNinjaSpeaks Cool, thanks a TON for the info.  I will get the cheaper Pixel 2 at a later date, then.  ;)
922252684849184769 2017-10-22 00:05:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Phanteks @NZXT @mMaresca_ It would be cool to do a Ryzen 7 build in one and a Coffee Lake build in the other.  Otherwise, make them very similar in aesthetics.
922248847501549569 2017-10-22 23:50:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ASUSUSA Yes, but is the build quality close to the Razer Chroma Blackwidow or the Corsair K70/K95?
922248449139118080 2017-10-22 23:48:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ASUSUSA @TalkAndroid Honestly debating whether I would prefer to buy a Zenphone next upgrade or a Pixel 2. Have a Pixel now and LOVE this phone.
922239759656849408 2017-10-22 23:14:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TechNinjaSpeaks So it's just the Pixel 2 XL?
922238884070723584 2017-10-22 23:10:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TechNinjaSpeaks Sounds like you got a faulty product, not that the entire line is an issue. RMA it and get back to us. My Pixel has been the best phone EVER
922238519019540481 2017-10-22 23:09:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT @mMaresca_ My preference is the s340 Elite HB. I almost bought one, then I settled for a @Phanteks Enthoo Evolv TG ATX.  An s340 Elite will be next.
922237906315595778 2017-10-22 23:07:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 Mid. The first one looks really clear, but sort of yellow like jaundice. The last one looks reddish, like rosacia. Middle looks most natural
922234970407686146 2017-10-22 22:55:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BarackObama @kalpenn @codykeenan Wow, people keep retweeting and liking this, but I just felt it was common knowledge.
922186851561213959 2017-10-22 19:44:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio Thanks for the info, btw.  It's very much appreciated!!
922174043041816576 2017-10-22 18:53:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @FreeMemesKids @TheJackGibbons Which one, the leg breaking or the wails if absolute pain after?
922173686379175941 2017-10-22 18:51:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ragegamingz_z @FreeMemesKids That's a broken leg, for sure.
922173297693024256 2017-10-22 18:50:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @totalwar @amazon @IntelGaming But I already bought a Ryzen 7 1700x.
922155937091108864 2017-10-22 17:41:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio I already work part time as a massage therapist.  Pays he bills, but also allows room for art school. We should DM sometime.  :)
922132536393953280 2017-10-22 16:08:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio And how do I used my talent to make real money.
922131135584526338 2017-10-22 16:02:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio Options after school.
922129348198625282 2017-10-22 15:55:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio Also, I would love to learn more about the business side of art.  Fine art major over here.
922128996367831040 2017-10-22 15:54:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ZenMonkeyStudio I'm on that path right now, but just starting my undergrad.  Long road ahead.
922127682996973568 2017-10-22 15:49:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Barnacules @JayzTwoCents Did to work???
922127296290541568 2017-10-22 15:47:34 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ASUS_ROG Still waiting for a swag bag from @ASUSUSA.  Loyal fan and love ASUS products! Would add a 1080ti Strix!!
921952492111441921 2017-10-21 04:12:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kalpenn @codykeenan I mean. We can easily discredit everything he is saying. Most of it is leftovers from @BarackObama.
921924448177086465 2017-10-21 02:21:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @xychelsea It's cute how they try to play military. Though, almost scary that they are this organized. I'd punch Richer Spencer.
921920351134715904 2017-10-21 02:05:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ASUSUSA Any idea when we are receiving our swag bags?  I have not recieved an email or heard anything about this drawing scheduled for Oct. 1st.
921883024240857088 2017-10-21 23:36:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @H1Z1 @ORIGINPCCEO Wow.  That is HUGE!  Looks like you're having a blast.  :P
921882263310295042 2017-10-21 23:33:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT @bellars_donnie Yay! no more dust!

921728452428009472 2017-10-21 13:22:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @IntelGaming @CableMod @ASUS_ROG @NZXT @MrPauers OH man, I couldn't face those LEDs outward.  They are blinding enough, already!
921722509636046849 2017-10-21 12:59:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @GioakG Personally, I would go for the ASUS mATX and 1600/1600x.  :P
921564204246630400 2017-10-20 02:30:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AMDGaming @DreamHack @CybertronPC I have that case, but damn if your's doesn't look so much sweeter.  :D

921188086947696640 2017-10-19 01:35:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JohnCleese Your dry English humour will go down in the history books.  Sounds about right.

921175487602397184 2017-10-19 00:45:25 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @bethesda @DOOM You guys forgetting the SNES version of DOOM?  I played the Hell out of it!
921175338348109830 2017-10-19 00:44:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @bethesda @Fallout I bought the original release version with the Season Pass.  Does this mean I also get 50% off of all creations?  Long time enthusiast here.
921174855566970881 2017-10-19 00:42:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA @eclecticbrotha What family?  I missed something..
921174744057163779 2017-10-19 00:42:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AMDRyzen @Thracks I bet @ASUSUSA loves these boards.  I certainly want one.  Going to plan a mini-itx Ryzen 5 build, now.  :D
921174258100899840 2017-10-19 00:40:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Twitch @GFuelEnergy @Jus_Dropsin Want.  Mail me one?
921174147090169856 2017-10-19 00:40:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @xychelsea I mean, at least this person hates you with proper grammar.  That's a step up from most of the conservative trolls I see hanging about.

921169977406656513 2017-10-19 00:23:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @planetepics Well, that was my clickbait for the day.  And, it was actually worth it!

921167831332524032 2017-10-19 00:15:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 Just wanted to say that I love your videos. You and @eberantony do a great job. Love the quality and visual style you guys create.
921167345804107776 2017-10-19 00:13:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT @TechDeals_16 @Oneyouhate1 I should say "the problem is not JUST affordability."  thanks for the fun debate, though! Always nice chatting with a fellow enthusiast.
921165509692968960 2017-10-19 00:05:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @intel @IntelGaming @ORIGINPCCEO That's a great setup, and a sweet @ORIGINPC!!!  GL this weekend, guys!
921109663390814208 2017-10-19 20:23:51 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> I entered a giveaway for a chance to win "Kingfast SSD 240GB - Solid State Drive with Inc..." by Kingfast. https://giveaway.amazon.com/p/85a615404e95fa3a/?ref_=tsm_4_tw_p_tw #giveaway
921106311466582017 2017-10-19 20:10:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT @TechDeals_16 @Oneyouhate1 You cannot limit it to just one factor. That being said, nobody wants bulky cases unless they need space for 20 HDD or a server.
921105800734547968 2017-10-19 20:08:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT @TechDeals_16 @Oneyouhate1 It is in part affordability, but is also utility of the larger cases. They a huge, hard to fill, and expensive to liquid cool.
921062093444534273 2017-10-19 17:14:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT @TechDeals_16 @Oneyouhate1 The problem is not affordability. The problem is marketability. Nobody is buying huge cases so nobody is making them. #markettrends
920808811715215360 2017-10-18 00:28:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Mashalkhan56 @Erika_M_T Also, I want clarify a bit. I'm not saying, "you must tell your story." I'm saying, "telling your story helps." We have to talk about it.
920804996874092544 2017-10-18 00:13:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Mashalkhan56 @Erika_M_T Interesting how you immediately demonized me.  :/  Perhaps what I should have said was "thank you for sharing."
920762167791702017 2017-10-18 21:23:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @paulhardware So, one more question... 28-32" 4k monitor and paired graphics card: Any suggestions?  Your favorites?  Looking to save up and buy.
920761395561615360 2017-10-18 21:19:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @paulhardware Don't worry about throwing that SSD.  They have no moving parts.  :P  #trololol
920761018304880647 2017-10-18 21:18:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @paulhardware So, by market trends, I should wait about a year and upgarde from 16gb to 32gb of Trident Z RGB 2400mhz for my Ryzen 7 rig?
920758226978787328 2017-10-18 21:07:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Erika_M_T @Alyssa_Milano #MeToo and #IWasHim.  Thanks for this post. Opening this conversation has created a dialogue to educate and prevent sexual assault.  
920757711209488384 2017-10-18 21:05:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Erika_M_T @Mashalkhan56 I agree with you, but right now hearing those experiences are an important part of opening a diaglogue to really start healing. #MeToo
920707850812391424 2017-10-18 17:47:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Sbarro @sethmeyers @jimmykimmel @Kelosdad I used to work at Sbarro, they make their dough from scratch daily.
920707570221965312 2017-10-18 17:46:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Sbarro @sethmeyers @jimmykimmel Is that a middle finger?  Because I see a middle finger.  :D  Somebody must enjoy Chicago deep dish a little more.
920707314600071168 2017-10-18 17:45:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Do not like it. 80tb of hdd, but less than 1tb of ssd.. 2x Vega 56 at that price point, not 64!? Empty SSD bay. That yellow. Waste of case.

920677586220605441 2017-10-18 15:46:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @TheResistance67 @THX0785 You're my hero.
920676639377420289 2017-10-18 15:43:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 It's "you're."  Also, grammatically correct.  Thanks!
920675931265617920 2017-10-18 15:40:22 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 Don't try to redirect.  It won't work.
920675727812513793 2017-10-18 15:39:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 You've already used abuse tactics in this conversation and now you are using sarcasm to try to save face.  We see you.
920675209845276672 2017-10-18 15:37:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 No, but it can be objectifying.  You're still not listening.  I do not believe you are emotionally intelligent enough to understand.
920674383009640451 2017-10-18 15:34:12 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 You could start by paying attention to what she has to say. Then, maybe you will find something other than her ass to compliment.
920674104595943426 2017-10-18 15:33:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 And you just took it to a place of abuse. This is an ad hominem attack. Instead of debating, you attack the person. #youaretheproblem
920673504957288450 2017-10-18 15:30:43 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 No, but again... it can be objectifying. If the only thing you can think to say is "you're pretty" then you are objectfying.
920672296800436224 2017-10-18 15:25:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 You do you.  If you are not willing to continue this conversation because it make you uncomfortable, then you should look within.
920672050276175872 2017-10-18 15:24:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 No, but it can be objectifying if that is all you are looking at. Why can't she be intelligent, smart, or witty?
920671348028006400 2017-10-18 15:22:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA @armandodkos Actually, the media does call out Trump on his lies quite often.  Pretty directly, even.  It has not stopped his momentum.
920671120692600832 2017-10-18 15:21:15 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA Funny, I call them the same thing here in the USA.
920669075285643264 2017-10-18 15:13:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 Noooo!!  I'm new to this game.  I just thought all you techtubers recieved all the new goodies for free.  What I get for assumptions.
920668622288293896 2017-10-18 15:11:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 That's because most men do, without even realizing that they are assaulting women. It's cultural. It's systemic. Coersion counts.
920668334013763585 2017-10-18 15:10:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @PCGamesN Looks like Intel also stole AMD's new pin design for Threadripper. Am I wrong here? Also, they now run hotter than the AMD equivalent. LOL.
920667405419995136 2017-10-18 15:06:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA But, also being a victim gives me a unique perspective to see both sides. I feel that is important to engage. The PTSD is real, though.
920667192236167168 2017-10-18 15:05:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JMCFRAVA Yeah, that is why I feel the need to come forward. Seems like the timing is right.  I'm terrified, though. Saying #IWasHim is not easy.
920666944940007424 2017-10-18 15:04:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 Women are not second class citizens or sexual objects there for our pleasure. Talking about these things will bring understanding.
920666403165954048 2017-10-18 15:02:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @THX0785 @TheResistance67 Accept that we are a large part of the problem in perpetuating a culture of sexual assault towards women. Engage in conversation.
920664226808688642 2017-10-18 14:53:51 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 At least give it a real shot and use a Vega for comparison. I feel the outcome will be the same per your decision, but give it a fair shot.
920660559091167232 2017-10-18 14:39:16 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KatieFoisy @OJs_Left_Glove ^^^ This is what chauvinism looks like. I'm am man and a feminist. Look out, I'm emotionally available!
920659610800881665 2017-10-18 14:35:30 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @BBC_HaveYourSay Done.  I will be available all day.
920487466397814784 2017-10-17 03:11:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eberantony I'm so happy with my Pixel and I feel the same way.  By the time I'm actually ready for an upgrade, Pixel 3 will probably be out.  ;)

920432705501790209 2017-10-17 23:33:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @KatieFoisy @OJs_Left_Glove ^^^ This is abuse.  That is all.
920432191548608512 2017-10-17 23:31:49 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AnthonyBLSmith @feministabulous I will take responsiblity, but I am also a victim of sexual assault. Fixing the issue starst with admitting the issue. #MeToo #IDidThat
920431345066704896 2017-10-17 23:28:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @TheResistance67 Nobody is saying that "all men" assault women.
920424843601948674 2017-10-17 23:02:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @feministabulous @rhoderedpvd @TheResistance67 If you cannot see the problem, there is a high probability that you are part of the problem.
920414816120066058 2017-10-17 22:22:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AMDRyzen @AMDGaming @Stalewind_Farto Currently a @CORSAIR h115i, but I almost bought an @NZXT Kraken x62.They use the same parts, just NZXT has more flash. Planning custom loop.
920369813083639808 2017-10-17 19:23:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @GreenManGaming Want one.  :P
920368777468006400 2017-10-17 19:19:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AMDRyzen @AMDGaming Seriously in love with my 1700x.  Simply the best processor I have owned to date. #AMDRyzen #LoveMyBuild

920068687205412864 2017-10-16 23:27:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO This is why I always hardwire my PC.  I use wifi only on Android devices that don't matter like my Nook.
920068173059317760 2017-10-16 23:25:21 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO Science is freaking sweet!

919907642935599104 2017-10-16 12:47:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Razer @Zephry01 It's not just about LED Strips, it's being able to use Chroma enabled lighting.  It's about programmable led strips.
919907294766387200 2017-10-16 12:46:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Razer @5wypwy So I'm missing the s340 Razer Edition.  I feel like I'm holding pretty strong on my peripheral game.
919774712481411072 2017-10-15 03:59:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Razer Looks like that would go well with my Razer Blackwidow Chroma, Naga Chroma, and Kraken 7.1 v2 Chroma. Any discounts for a loyal enthusiast?pic.twitter.com/aOjzVl2rYd

918286246253867009 2017-10-11 01:24:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @westerndigital @bitwitkyle I feel like minimalism and sustainability is absolutely what they are going for, here.  Packaging is unimportant and wasteful.
918218419425685504 2017-10-11 20:55:05 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @terrycrews Thanks for coming forward. This is real strength and power. I, too, have PTSD from similar abuses. Keep your head up, brother.
918217133347295232 2017-10-11 20:49:58 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 Btw, the 4k camera on the original Pixel is SICK!  Plus the unlimited storage on Google cloud for picture and video is an amazing deal.
918216850198147078 2017-10-11 20:48:51 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 I'm using the original Pixel right now, in that sick blue.  Been rocking Samsung for years, but Pixel is the best phone I've owned.
918214123984510976 2017-10-11 20:38:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @GamerNexus @ares25dc @PeterM_c @GamersNexus @JayzTwoCents @hardwarecanucks Well, this just happened.  I approve.
918213963975970817 2017-10-11 20:37:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 I feel it is by design.  Apple is notorious for pulling this kind of stunt.  I certainly hope they fix the issue, but if not get a Pixel 2.
918213591349780481 2017-10-11 20:35:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPC No, I believe you've got the right idea!! Just think BIGGER!  :D
917986902459977730 2017-10-10 05:35:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPC More like 24k or higher in the not so distant future.
917976298043080712 2017-10-10 04:52:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon @jingletard @RetroHurricane Also odd, I did not realize that the point of helping people was for the goal of having sex with them.  *shrug* Who knew.
917972587094953985 2017-10-10 04:38:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon You should block abusive people.  #HarmonBlock2017
917971959899742208 2017-10-10 04:35:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jingletard And congrats, that's at least 2 points for you on the gaslighting spectrum. Do you want me to go away now?  Too intense for you, snowflake?
917970511518367749 2017-10-10 04:29:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jingletard Actually, It's a clinical diagnosis. Please, keep being abusive to people we can get you permanently banned.
917968126624649216 2017-10-10 04:20:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @RetroHurricane @jingletard That is not fragility, it is PTSD created by dealing with gaslighting from people like you. Your lack of empathy is exhausting.

917964163334443009 2017-10-10 04:04:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon @RetroHurricane @jingletard You're being abusive, congratulations!  You are absolutely part of the problem.

917962486128705536 2017-10-10 03:58:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon @jingletard I just read everything you said in Rick's voice, @RetroHurricane .
917962323691745280 2017-10-10 03:57:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon @jingletard @RetroHurricane Thanks for this.
917932172006383616 2017-10-10 01:57:38 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @eberantony I want one.  Currently using the Google Pixel, myself.
917932027172872195 2017-10-10 01:57:04 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon @jingletard Thanks for petpetuating the exact culture we are trying to bring to light. Don't be an asshat and shame people for being abuse, jingletard.
917931716777594880 2017-10-10 01:55:50 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @danharmon Honestly, I have PTSD from familial abuse.  I have also, as a massage therapist, been sexual harassed by coworkers and clients alike.

917539406436884480 2017-10-09 23:56:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AMDRyzen Currently running a 1700x and I LOVE it.  Glad to hear your future planned CPUs are going to be AM4 compatible!
917529238181482497 2017-10-09 23:16:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AdobePremiere @tremblingwater @Dimitry49 This was my first intuitive thought.  Running a Ryzen system currently??
917528638828015621 2017-10-09 23:14:09 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AdobePremiere @Dimitry49 What are your system specs??
917434060405903360 2017-10-09 16:58:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @hardwarecanucks Still loving my Ryzen 7 1700x.  ;)
916832402110124032 2017-10-07 01:07:33 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TEAMEVGA Seriously, a GREAT choice.  I've used EVGA video cards for years.  They are my #1 go to!

916811107964215296 2017-10-07 23:42:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO I'm seriously going to boot up A Link to the Past. It's my favorite Zelda title and it's been on my mind since I saw your post.
916283802389041152 2017-10-06 12:47:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Braddock512 @ORIGINPCCEO Sweet!  Thanks for the info.  I play on PC, the master race.

916112126640607232 2017-10-05 01:25:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @nvidiashield @hardwarecanucks I mean, I would totally buy a used 1080 from you.  Just saying.  I can help you with that problem, ya know?  
916021315752087553 2017-10-05 19:24:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO Well, there goes my week.

915775463238270976 2017-10-04 03:07:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO Take a good, deep breath...  is it downloaded, now?
915775303112327168 2017-10-04 03:07:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Woblyware @ORIGINPCCEO Same!  There are a few I want to play, soon.  One of them is Dead Cells.  Castlevania: Syphony of the Night is one of my favorites.
915757540927033348 2017-10-04 01:56:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Woblyware @ORIGINPCCEO I really enjoy the love you show to old-school styled video games.  :D

915266520032440322 2017-10-03 17:25:17 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @drvox Yep.  It's called a personality disorder.  Probably clinical narcissism.

915196137690234880 2017-10-03 12:45:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents What case you buying?  I just got the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ATX TG Edition.  It's AMAZING!!  Best case I have ever owned, by far.
915195574835666945 2017-10-03 12:43:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jemisha_johnson @GavinMackie6 @Warlokk6 @menfi36 No.  Some states require a carry permit, some states require licensure.  Depends on the state.  Many have nothing at all beyond background.
915073124177268738 2017-10-02 04:36:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents @HKGangster54 I like the ASUS boards for their bios flashback.  It's a REALLY great feature!

914962779223859200 2017-10-02 21:18:20 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents @HKGangster54 Crosshair VI Hero is solid.  Asus Aura is my only complaint.  That being said, if your going Ryzen the Asrock Taichi is very solid, also.
914962406639534081 2017-10-02 21:16:51 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents My Crosshair VI Hero is amazing!!  My only complaint is the Aura Software.  What are you looking to build?
914961984948441089 2017-10-02 21:15:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents @adryx_92 This has been fixed for many months now.
914961840857391110 2017-10-02 21:14:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents @voss2016 Man up?  Way to be misogynistic, bro.  People are allowed to express their anger without being shamed for it.
914961116761149443 2017-10-02 21:11:44 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents @James_Barlett You cannot use that with an ASUS board, can you?
914960917695270912 2017-10-02 21:10:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents @HilmiAdi That would be amazing.  Having a 3rd party app to control everything.  One app to rule them all!  #myprecious

914939400580210690 2017-10-02 19:45:26 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents Wish you had said this before I bought my Crosshair Hero VI.  Love the board, hare the RGB software.  Hope they actually add a save setting.
914938091768569857 2017-10-02 19:40:14 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents This has been resolved.  Old news.
914937823911907328 2017-10-02 19:39:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents Asus aura us BS.  I almost regret my Crosshair Hero VI purchase, but it is an amazing board.  Just going to run RGB with HUE+ later.
914937193927462914 2017-10-02 19:36:40 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jemisha_johnson @GavinMackie6 You don't need a firearms license to acquire a bushmaster or an AR-15.  Not in my state.
914936709963554816 2017-10-02 19:34:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kalpenn @Sm0kehh And your right, banning guns may not help.  It's systemic violence and we have to trace the cause to its source.  What if guns are the root?
914936390567301120 2017-10-02 19:33:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kalpenn @Sm0kehh That's not what you said.  You stated that he was pursuing leftist agenda.  He just wants these mass murders to stop and posted statistics.
914928592487944193 2017-10-02 19:02:29 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kalpenn @Sm0kehh Typical lack of empathy.
914928535973896194 2017-10-02 19:02:16 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kalpenn We need a real answer and real sociological studies into why this keeps happening, not just bullshit political fluff.  I'm with you.
914927947907321859 2017-10-02 18:59:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AMike4761 @MsSheila757 Done.
914927433589121025 2017-10-02 18:57:53 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AMike4761 @CPCJuiceBox @Razor_Sabre What the hell is PFP?  Use real words, please.
914927177132576768 2017-10-02 18:56:52 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AMike4761 Don't make this about race or religion.  Say what it really is, radical fundamentalism.  All religions have them.  Heard of Dillon Roof?
914926336426291201 2017-10-02 18:53:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @SenatorMenendez So, maybe you should look at the sociological reasons for such violence.  It's systemic.  Think about that.
914926033366863877 2017-10-02 18:52:19 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jemisha_johnson This is inaccurate.  Most mass shooters use bushmaster and 9mm handguns.  You can buy these at Wal-Mart.
914266849478676480 2017-09-30 23:12:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @kalpenn Both are unacceptable, one is absolutely deplorable.  #ImpeachTrump

913743794344009728 2017-09-29 12:34:31 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO Free to people who own Skyrim during the first week of release.  They did the same thing for Skyrim HD.
913564696548118528 2017-09-28 00:42:51 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ORIGINPCCEO Actually, it's been announced as free for the first week of release, at least to PC users.  If you buy Skyrim after that, you have to pay.
913191136428163072 2017-09-27 23:58:27 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @bitwitkyle @paulhardware @anadroid614 Or both.  :D

912812896563990530 2017-09-26 22:55:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @Dimitry49 That's because heart disease is the number 1 killer around the world.

911395164958097408 2017-09-22 01:01:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @teresaparrish23 Again, the insurance companies set those prices... NOT the ACA.  And I am single. And my premium would be 400 a month for 1 person without.
911331521189105664 2017-09-22 20:49:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @teresaparrish23 I could not afford insurance until the ACA.  Seriously, it's impossibly high for everyone.  I would be paying 400 a month without the ACA.

910598263140704256 2017-09-20 20:15:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @JustASpoiledBat @kiely_88 Those premiums were already on the rise BEFORE the ACA.  They will rise even more after it's repeal.  Just wait, you will see.
910597917001560064 2017-09-20 20:13:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan It's literally pooling your money to cover everyone who has your plan.  The insurance companies control the prices, not the gov or ACA.
910597786197995520 2017-09-20 20:13:24 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan Your premium went up because of rising insurance costs.  Do you know how insurance works?  You put money in so everyone can take money out.
910597609982656513 2017-09-20 20:12:42 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @mkdfla Where did you get your information?  Links?  Canadians support universal healthcare.  This is why they have universal healthcare.
910597187075231745 2017-09-20 20:11:02 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @mkdfla A good doctor is held back by money being forced by his physicians group to only give you 8 min of their time.  That is not a good system.
910596942249553921 2017-09-20 20:10:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @cssandiego1 The insurance companies being able to set the prices that is the problem, get it right.
910596732450467840 2017-09-20 20:09:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @kiely_88 @JustASpoiledBat @Talisac80 There is nothing planned.  They just want to repeal without replacement.  And the insurance companies are fucking everyone, not the ACA.
910596523532177410 2017-09-20 20:08:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @Seanyisongling And, for the record, you cannot afford the ACA without a job. You have to work and pay for it.  You obviously do not know what it really is.
910596249589551105 2017-09-20 20:07:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @Seanyisongling I work FULL TIME as a licensed massage therapist and I am going to school FULL TIME to pick up a 2nd career.  Try again, and be respectful.
910596075345661952 2017-09-20 20:06:37 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @JustASpoiledBat @kiely_88 @Seanyisongling False, they were already rising long before the ACA.  They will increase even more after it is repealed.  Just wait.
910595917400739840 2017-09-20 20:05:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @AspenTN Wrong.  You have no health insurance because of rising premiums.  Insurance companies set those prices, not the ACA or the government.
910595714945822721 2017-09-20 20:05:11 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @SupaReaper @Seanyisongling I believe we are moving to a point in society where we can move beyond health costs by taking care of one another.
910492014885720065 2017-09-20 13:13:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ASUSUSA Why would you support this?  It's killing the GPU market.  But... I guess if you guys are making money on selling more GPU, who cares?
910491599616004096 2017-09-20 13:11:28 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @mkdfla That's not true, ask Canada and not what the local media believes about Canada.
910491209373712384 2017-09-20 13:09:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @JustASpoiledBat @kiely_88 Those premiums are rising regardless of whether or not the ACA is in place.  Projections for repeal are a 20% premium increase first year.
910490994889707522 2017-09-20 13:09:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @JustASpoiledBat @kiely_88 @Talisac80 Not true, if you cannot get affordable insurance or your work does not offer a plan, then you can have the fee waived by on your taxes.
910490784230707202 2017-09-20 13:08:13 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @SupaReaper Honestly, I feel we should use what we can.  Without the ACA my premium is $400 a month, with the ACA it's $115.  Not perfect, but helpful.
910490439307943936 2017-09-20 13:06:51 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @dannsdad Oh, I'm a real person.  ;)  #Resist
910360308153241600 2017-09-19 04:29:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT You make this in black & purple and I'll bite.
910341089336418307 2017-09-19 03:13:23 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @mkdfla And yes, profit CAN be a bad thing if it is the main focus of healthcare.  Would you rather see a doctor focused on money or your health?
910340887535906817 2017-09-19 03:12:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan @mkdfla The local free clinic will not allow me to use their services because I am employed.  Hence my insurance is through the ACA.
910326167995068416 2017-09-19 02:14:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan You're right, but until we get profit out of the equation for insurance and hospitals, then it will never change.
910323106094436352 2017-09-19 02:01:56 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @ASUSUSA @GingerPascoe This is why I build desktops for gaming, instead.  Less heat problems with a massive video card and easily replaced if something happens.
910322616988299265 2017-09-19 01:59:59 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome @DrPJSullivan If you withdraw that bill, I will personally have no insurance.  It's not the bill that is the problem, it is the incentive for profit.
910320799726411776 2017-09-19 01:52:46 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @StephenAtHome So, I suppose they are also suggesting a mass exodus from practice of world religion and thorough conversation to Catholicism?
910313565147602946 2017-09-19 01:24:01 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @NZXT I would love to add 3x 140mm Aer fans to my setup.  Looking forward to this!  thanks!

897920879480508416 2017-08-16 20:39:54 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump Thanks for this.
897920336997392384 2017-08-16 20:37:45 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump You're right.  Droppings nukes on N. Korea would be unacceptable.
897920125696966657 2017-08-16 20:36:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @JayzTwoCents @bitwitkyle DID SOMEBODY SAY POTATOES!?  *NOM NOM*
897919793923272704 2017-08-16 20:35:36 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jk_rowling I love that you see your computers as faithful companions.  I, too, enjoy treating my computers as though they are living creatures.
897918159843467265 2017-08-16 20:29:06 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @bitwitkyle gotta love windows updates.
897918056307077121 2017-08-16 20:28:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jk_rowling it's humbling to know that, as a former billionaire, you have the same simple computer problems as the rest of us.  May she RIP.  <3
897573311810605057 2017-08-15 21:38:48 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @CORSAIR I would prefer for my AM4 bracket for the h115i I bought to get here!  The VERY LAST piece I need in order to start up my Ryzen 7 build!!
896188649804640256 2017-08-11 01:56:39 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @DrNeilTyson The nerd in you is real.  :D
895405726570618881 2017-08-09 22:05:35 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @katiewright You're one to talk.  You're only as pretty as your distasteful personality.
895149937998143488 2017-08-08 05:09:10 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Thanks Obama.  Seriously, though.
895063710754107392 2017-08-08 23:26:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump Donald Fucking Trump, what nightmare of a war are you going to plung us into?
891483367665012736 2017-07-29 02:19:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb -Matthew 19:24
891483299285172225 2017-07-29 02:19:16 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
891483232092475397 2017-07-29 02:19:00 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb You do realize that you are tweeting this to a billionaire, right?
891482676640743424 2017-07-29 02:16:47 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @TEAMEVGA Feel free to mail me one of those greasy 1080s, anytime.  #lookingtoupgrade #RyzenRig #Needa1080 #EVGAFTW
891074519871483906 2017-07-28 23:14:55 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jk_rowling Following you on twitter is the greatest decision I've made since voting for Bernie Sanders in the primaries. #keeptrollingtrump
891072950048362497 2017-07-28 23:08:41 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @jk_rowling You are my hero for soooo many reasons, now.  <3  Keep up the epic trolling.
891063542836858880 2017-07-28 22:31:18 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @skylarkhome @realDonaldTrump @MdKnightBabe With the exception of all the days he's spent playing golf on the taxpayers dime.
891063348682424321 2017-07-28 22:30:32 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @The_Trump_Train You're right, he's too busy abusing his own power for personal gain.
891063227257430016 2017-07-28 22:30:03 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @Protrump45 Because all free media is obviously fake media.  There is only one common denominator here, and it's not the news outlets.
891062949724516352 2017-07-28 22:28:57 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> Only after we give one to Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler.https://twitter.com/Team_Trump45/status/891043388228861952
891061486835126274 2017-07-28 22:23:08 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump @pastormarkburns Too bad this doesn't include strong grammatical use of the English language.
891061233230770177 2017-07-28 22:22:07 UTC <TheOnlyTibrael> @realDonaldTrump I have great healthcare already, thanks to the ACA.
