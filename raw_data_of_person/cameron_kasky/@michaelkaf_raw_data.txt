971776962019676160 2018-03-08 15:57:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @GrokNation @missmayim Loved your website. Seems to b mostly for chix.
971775338593255425 2018-03-08 15:51:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @SpeakerRyan Are you going to do what the majority want; Universal Background Checks. Assault Weapon BAN. Tweet when you get that done, until than shut the f**k up. #WeAreNotStupid
971610846865625088 2018-03-07 04:57:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @hardball Wonder what he is worried about?
971609518642814976 2018-03-07 04:52:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @bellasarge2 @RealJamesWoods Can you spell "sour grapes?
971607957547954177 2018-03-07 04:46:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @StillWoke100 @Megan4MAGA We love an open mind. Get one.
971607499223851009 2018-03-07 04:44:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @Megan4MAGA Guns are not hilarious they kill and should be regulated. Cars and drivers are regulated for our safety. Yet, everyone who wants to drive can do do so safely or suffer the consequences.
971601961064812544 2018-03-07 04:22:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @rmasher2 I love it. You nailed it. I couldnt have said it better myself. #weAreNotStupid
971594669225402368 2018-03-07 03:53:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @G99Greg @GPAMad @bellasarge2 We are not instigators. We're people with dif opinions. We care about our country. We care abt the truth
971592192841183237 2018-03-07 03:43:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @Osteo_darkforce He is cracking under pressure. Leaving the DACA kids hanging makes him look bad. He can't afford that right now. Thats why he is letting them renew their status.
971582323362811905 2018-03-07 03:04:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @G99Greg @GPAMad @bellasarge2 If you can't take the heat get out if the kitchen. Better yet stay in your bubble and live in ignorant bliss.
971578654340911104 2018-03-07 02:49:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly What about aerobic workouts. Good for your cardiovascular and your metabolism
971561836662358016 2018-03-07 01:42:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg If you can't debate the issue you attack your opponent. By attacking the media you are not denying the truth.
971560352889663488 2018-03-07 01:36:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg @mcgintyman Republicans think there is bias in the news because they can't handle the truth. If you believe what Trump says than the truth is not your friend
971532431781171202 2018-03-07 23:45:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Wouldn't it b more proactive for us to put forth a plan. You had no problem enacting a blanket tariff on steel & aluminium
971530639014055936 2018-03-07 23:38:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @JohnNew2015 You are so proud that you rescinded  DACA. NOW YOU ARE BLAMING DEMS FOR NOT FIXING. DISPICABLE!
971528847383519232 2018-03-07 23:31:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Talk is cheap. Lies cost even less. So far you are a no show when it comes to fighting China
971527540434259968 2018-03-07 23:26:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @GovMattBevin @VP 85% of benefits go to corps and 1%. This tax cut will us $1.5 trillion of debt. VERY BAD!
971522054708133889 2018-03-07 23:04:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @DLoesch @Marina_Sirtis We don't want to take away guns from law abiding citizens. We want common sense controls on lethal weapons. We regulate the he'll out of cars and drivin. People drive. WHY NOT GUNS?
971416284628946945 2018-03-07 16:04:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @krassenstein Anyone that can count to three has figured it out. It's good to have it confirmed. HE IS A CRIMINAL!
971415363962527744 2018-03-07 16:00:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @Its_only_Bob @Richardfreeusa Are you really that stupid? And you have a big gun. Scarry!
971414924487512064 2018-03-07 15:59:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @Its_only_Bob @Richardfreeusa He is one and the same.
971405187033325569 2018-03-07 15:20:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Your using your office to sell a friend's book. That is unethical and probably illegal. You are a disgrace.
971403915651665920 2018-03-07 15:15:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We can no longer compete with countries that have cheaper labor. We buy cheap imports leaving more money to spend which is ultimately good for our economy. WE ARE THE BEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. #URaMoron
971401964771840005 2018-03-07 15:07:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We are the richest country in the world. We buy more than anyone else. We import more than anyone else hence the the trade imbalance. That is a big part of it. We need to punish the offenders who don't play fair. Otherwise you start tariff wars.
971266009427562498 2018-03-06 06:07:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @WSJ Good time to send him on a vacation to Mexico. Can I go too?
971264286390702080 2018-03-06 06:00:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @thinkprogress They're tired of doing nothing at the EPA.
971263632511242241 2018-03-06 05:57:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @KurtSchlichter Have a nice day. Maybe try decaf next time
971263063885217792 2018-03-06 05:55:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @FoxNews @WillWtroyer Your right Will, it's the evil press picking on poor p***y grabbing, cheating, lying Donny.
971262360907370496 2018-03-06 05:52:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @WillWtroyer @StephenMilIer Yes, now I see the light. Obama is the evil one and sweet innocent Donny is being picked on by the FAKE MEDIA (truth).
971261129644236807 2018-03-06 05:47:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump A deal with these kids was made you just won't live up to it. #WeAreNotStupid
971260663040499715 2018-03-06 05:46:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We became energy independent under your mentor Barack Housain Obama. Did he ever show you a copy of his birth certificate?
971239492710518785 2018-03-06 04:21:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @NoSpinNews TRUMP does not need help blaming someone else for anything that goes wrong hiring his admin. His motto "The buck stops anywhere but here".
971237965597937666 2018-03-06 04:15:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @NoSpinNews BIGLY NEWS HEADLINE "BARACK OBAMA IS GONE" ring a bell? Way up on BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN  that goes both ways.
971212994054062080 2018-03-06 02:36:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Who are you kidding? I wouldn't want to work somewhere with a speedy revolving door. If I can also expect to pay huge legal fees. Good luck.
971083363858644994 2018-03-06 18:01:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @missmayim The man is dillusional.
971082888144916481 2018-03-06 17:59:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @StevenBrill @BillOReilly Your move to neutrality is admirable. Or just a desperate move to get members. I am skeptical.
971072886780948480 2018-03-06 17:19:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You had the right but not the mandate. U were not compelled to do so. You wanted a weapon to get your WALL. #WeAreNotStupid.
971072035597242369 2018-03-06 17:16:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump President Moon of SK is a moderate dove who reached out his hand to NK and now we may have peace talks. There is the lesson. Peace is possible. Not always easy but worth the effort.
970905776511488000 2018-03-05 06:15:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @williamlegate When your right to own an assault weapon interfered with my right for public safety you better believe you need to show need. No right granted in the constitution is absolute.
970903958666477568 2018-03-05 06:08:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @cameron_kasky God bless you! Be strong.

970893694994968576 2018-03-05 05:27:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler I think we should let him put it up on his jail cell wall.
970892621148192773 2018-03-05 05:23:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler Let's hope he's out of office before the first Seal goes up. 
970890611057483776 2018-03-05 05:15:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly How many members do you have? Have you broken into double digits? Your groveling is getting embarrasing. Wake up and smell the coffee. You are on the wrong side of history. #BlueTsunami #BullshitMtnIsComingDown.
970886317050605568 2018-03-05 04:58:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @ColumbiaBugle Great advice. If you never want to win another election again. 
970884549164109829 2018-03-05 04:51:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You rescinded DACA and now you are trying to use it as blackmail to get your wall.They're not buying it.   #MuellerTime
970881103849500672 2018-03-05 04:37:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump How can you keep making such vulgar lies? Really?!?!?! #WeAreNotStupid
970879015841161216 2018-03-05 04:29:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @davidaxelrod Being a moron helps in getting a job on the @realDonaldTrump team.
970877743129878529 2018-03-05 04:24:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @kshering @JesseFFerguson How about assaulted? Beginning to identify with the #metoo people.
970875215101251586 2018-03-05 04:14:23 UTC <michaelkaf> @AIPAC @VP Just don't mess up the peace process. The Palestenians no longer trust you to mediate peace.
970820808917618688 2018-03-05 00:38:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @NicolleDWallace I confess, I have a friend like that too. Did he seem like a moron to anyone else?
970816621437751297 2018-03-05 00:21:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @OfficialJonZal The party of dirty tricks never ceases to amaze.
970815196032831488 2018-03-05 00:15:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @VP A no brainer. Right up your alley.
970814091366490113 2018-03-05 00:11:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Don't forget to floss. Very important for healthy gums.  Are you picking on millennials? Are the young not hip to your arcane ideaology?
970720666751307780 2018-03-05 18:00:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly For someone who did not watch how can you have so much criticism? Shoveling the BS is a reflexive response.
970719012572286976 2018-03-05 17:53:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly If it's funny and entertaining ratings are up. As far as what we've enough off its you, the N R A and our fake pres. The blue tsunami is coming. IT'S OUR TIME.
970682830425612288 2018-03-05 15:29:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly So watch Andy Griffit and get off your hi horse with the $3 fake vocabulary.
970671772508008449 2018-03-05 14:45:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter I have read your stuff. It's worse than you imagine. RACIST xenophobia runs deep!
970671105458556928 2018-03-05 14:43:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @PostEverything @washingtonpost Much easier to control how the next mass will occur. GUNS. Figuring out who is next to impossible.
970669243737038851 2018-03-05 14:35:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @DLoesch @NRATV We are not scared. The blue tsunami is coming and will wash away the trash. 35% approval rating. Worse ever. #RESISTNOW
970666118695223302 2018-03-05 14:23:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @washingtonpost If we don't learn from out past we are bound to repeat it. We have too much debt to save the next crash.
970664426897596416 2018-03-05 14:16:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You can not win the war on drugs. The solution is decriminalization and regulations.
970663724125163522 2018-03-05 14:14:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Lies, lies, lies. If u were Pinoccio your nose would b a mile long. Obama did plenty against Russian meddling. You wouldn't even admit  the truth and even now u r doing nothing. NO SANCTIONS. U want them to help u again.
970541857775194112 2018-03-04 06:09:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @BreitbartNews @AIIAmericanGirI Admit it, you got a little hot?

970539744437432320 2018-03-04 06:01:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @davidrodneyarch  That ain't Clint Eastwood that is following you. Duh! I sure am glad you are in the minority.

970537057843056640 2018-03-04 05:50:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @AdamSchiffCA How did this man ever get out of the 5th grade?
970536338255736833 2018-03-04 05:47:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @AdamSchiffCA We desperately want him to give up his day job.
970535365378527232 2018-03-04 05:43:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @DLoesch The N R A used to be for universal background checks. What happened? Gun shows make too much money? 1 out of every 4 guns sold  w/o back ground checks. THAT IS NOT OK!!!
970530094514098176 2018-03-04 05:23:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @DLoesch You can't go any lower.
970514059727601664 2018-03-04 04:19:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @krassenstein On March 24 let's march. VOTE!  VOTE!
970512546708054018 2018-03-04 04:13:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @AidenWolfe Thats very heartwarming. Goog luck you and God bless.
970490583130279936 2018-03-04 02:46:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @WalshFreedom @AnInquisitor Or you could watch FOX. Where decency and truth go to die.
970486952205127683 2018-03-04 02:31:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @RyanAFournier Can you explain why we need: Assault weapons. Can you explain why we can't have: Universal background checks.
970485066764824577 2018-03-04 02:24:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @RyanAFournier Lies: God being banned. Christians being mocked. So true: Guns are the problem.
970469052677279744 2018-03-04 01:20:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Once upon a time when we were sensitive and cared for each other we tried to be PC. The good old days.
970437257537650689 2018-03-04 23:14:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @SpeakerRyan Talk is cheap. You cut the budget for programs needed. Your priority is the military and tax breaks for the wealthy.
970424552940503040 2018-03-04 22:23:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @RyanAFournier It's not the only problem but it is the one we can fix. Much easier to know how than who.
970407654379151360 2018-03-04 21:16:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump What we are really ashamed of is you. You lie consistently. You have made flip flopping into an art. Dysfunctional gov't. Corruption. Your bromance with Putin.....  #RESIGN
970406316937183233 2018-03-04 21:11:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump What is being mocked is our ridiculous fake pres.
970403869913214976 2018-03-04 21:01:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @EdKrassen Hope you're right. I wish he'd hurry up.

970401737000529920 2018-03-04 20:52:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @dkap1955 @GaertnerScott Time for our fake president to resign and takes his family with him!
970399794823868416 2018-03-04 20:45:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @NancyWonderful @minnlion What I find amusing is that Trump supporters call us Commiecrats when their fake pres has a thing with the #1 Commie - Putin.
970347121592406017 2018-03-04 17:15:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @SpeakerRyan How much money has been budgeted for that purpose? I'm the past the GOP had cut spending for those programs. Talk is cheap.
970173994551922688 2018-03-03 05:47:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @glennbeck @BillOReilly Your beginning to sound needy. If you want to break through speak up against the insanity in the WH. You know in your heart of hearts I am right. Don't hesitate. When he goes down you will b a fading memory.
970172272030953473 2018-03-03 05:41:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @glennbeck @BillOReilly Glad your voices no longer matter. The kids are taking over. God bless them!
970171689874219008 2018-03-03 05:38:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly I see what you did there. You used your CUTE pooch to show how Putin is so harmless. #WeAreNotStupid

This does not change the fact that managed health care is a good idea. There are some of our biggest corporations that agree. They are doing it on their own and bypassing the gov't.
970097423388463104 2018-03-03 00:43:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @WhiteHouse @SecretService @MariaBonanno9 @cswildfeuer @Normaninvador76 For sure!
970088447884058625 2018-03-03 00:08:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @BruceBartlett @dmf71 I am on your side. I agree. I just don't want to give fodder to the right wingers by lying. I am very careful when I tweet. TRUTH is on our side.
970085979116769283 2018-03-03 23:58:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @smerconish Loved your show On MSNBC. Thoughtful and indighteful. You deserve a prime time slot.
970085240940171264 2018-03-03 23:55:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @thinkprogress @aboutSimonClark I strongly agree. Let him stay on the golf course 24/7.
970084564734496774 2018-03-03 23:52:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @thinkprogress No wonder he returns his salary. Even he agrees he does not earn it.
970083724988682240 2018-03-03 23:49:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @BruceBartlett @dmf71 I was just making the point that  they do have liberals on their programs and you agreed.  The rest is splitting hairs. If you look @ the begin. of chain you will agree. We tend to get caught up in identity politics.
970076682919923712 2018-03-03 23:21:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @BruceBartlett @dmf71 FOX has liberals on several of their programs. More than MSNBC. Maybe they are a weak. I find some of them make good points. On the whole they  Donny 's ass. I had caught them lying and they never retract. As progressive liberals we need to have truth on our side.
970073163144028162 2018-03-03 23:07:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @dmf71 @BruceBartlett I am a liberal progressive and I watch FOX. They do lie, distort and sometimes ignore  stories they don't like. However they do have liberals on several progrsms.
970068846106247169 2018-03-03 22:50:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @VP What is greater than our Anthem and our flag is our right to political protest. That is what distinguishes from other non Democratic countries. Your admin is attempting to erode that sacred right. SHAME ON YOU. Our right to protest is even more sacred than our to bear arms.

967420159265718273 2018-02-24 15:25:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Must insist on Mandatory Universal Background Checks. No loopholes. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS.

967197161359261698 2018-02-23 00:39:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @Smith83K @WesSmith123 Very funny.
967195612557885440 2018-02-23 00:32:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Look for diversion tactics. Attacking your opponent instead of attacking the issue means you have no defense. Beware of cries of pariotism.
967194126276964353 2018-02-23 00:27:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Actually that is good advice. If it sounds illogical than do a fact check. Find unbiased sources. Reputable news sources verify before they release the news. Trust sources that correct errors.
967154015644434432 2018-02-23 21:47:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Yes, it's the national media, the FBI, our gullible kids, the evil libetals. The only one destroying Donald is Donald.
967145918209273856 2018-02-23 21:15:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @NRA @ForeverNYGiants @RealJamesWoods The NRA acts as an agent for the gun industry by blocking any laws that would limit gun sales. They don't care abt human life.
967141593206571008 2018-02-23 20:58:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @DLoesch The FBI is not the problem. The problem is the NRA which block any common sense gun control legislation with huge sums of money. SHAME ON YOU. I don't believe u have a conscience. KIDS ARE DYING.
967126588570583040 2018-02-23 19:58:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @nytimes @NYTHealth Determining who the next mass murderer will be is next to impossible. Passing common sense gun control is much easier.
967124968688332800 2018-02-23 19:52:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @mviser He wants to grant security clearance to someone who has access to the WH just because he is a son In law!?!?! He has the balls to attack HRC FOR HER SLOPPY SECURITY!
967123544898289664 2018-02-23 19:46:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @shannonrwatts There is no money for school supplies and yet he wants to give bonuses to teachers w/guns. INSANE! #WeAreNotStupid
967121579556552705 2018-02-23 19:38:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @esd2000 @MikeLevinCA So true. So obvious. We no longer apply common sense. Lies are trurh, black is white, up is down. Insanity reigns.

967117733673357320 2018-02-23 19:23:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @SlythSeeker2017 @CNN So the message is CNN is the problem. They encourage, stage, promote mass shootings for the ratings. Perfectly logical or INSANE!
967116527689351168 2018-02-23 19:18:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Tolerance and acceptance was his message.

967114404503330816 2018-02-23 19:10:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @TuckerCarlson @CNN @realDonaldTrump @krissyshouse Watched the interview. This is his word vs CNN. This is misdirection and attacking the messenger vs debating common sense gun controls. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS  UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WHY NOT? WHY NOT? WHY NOT??
967087140948475904 2018-02-23 17:21:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @washingtonpost @larryhouse We must blame everyone and everything else except our fake pres. The worst president ever.

967070294018998272 2018-02-23 16:15:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @mviser It is not ez  to know who or where the next mass shooting will b. Much easier to control the how;  We know as long as it is relatively ez to purchase assault weapons they will do so.
967068479642779648 2018-02-23 16:07:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @mviser That is not the solution. Even if all teachers packed the mass murderers will go to malls,  churches, theatres, bus stations....
967066781608112130 2018-02-23 16:01:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @kdqd3 @Jabbadaddy2016 The problem is the proliferation of guns. The solution lies in reducing the power of $. As long as politicians can receive obscene amts  of money our votes are almost worthless.
967064450783047680 2018-02-23 15:51:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly As a viewer I will remember that this show brought pressure on lawmakers to pass gun control laws. We have had enough of Congressmen not representing us. The majority want: UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS NO GUNS BOT B4 AGE 21

We have not been attacked because we have the best military in the world. No other country even comes close. If every non-military citz got rid of their guns that would not change a thing.
966910615368298496 2018-02-22 05:40:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @TuckerCarlson @CNN @realDonaldTrump CNN totally denied the claim. I am sure you just forgot to mention that. I am sure you did not verify the survivors claim because you are a fake president all about lies (Fake news).
966906547765878784 2018-02-22 05:24:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @TuckerCarlson @CNN @realDonaldTrump If you want to show us you are better than that this would be a good time to release your tax teturns.

966837020667478017 2018-02-22 00:48:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Talk is cheap. That's all your good at that. Blowing not air. No WAY are you budging the N R A.

966830806990700544 2018-02-22 00:23:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @KeeptheSabbath4 @Ks48K There was an armed sheriff who was outside the school. He who was afraid to go in.
966829818040934400 2018-02-22 00:19:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @KeeptheSabbath4 What about malls,  supermarkets, churches, buses, trains, restaurants, movies, theatres, parks....
966828535011729408 2018-02-22 00:14:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Your not the only one. Coincidentally after the Assault Weapons Ban was allowed to lapse the number of mass murderer started to rise. Assault weapons are combat  weapons that do not belong in the street.
966820382849220608 2018-02-22 23:41:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @MarwaBalkar @TheRightOfRight Obama tried and did not succeed. He pleaded. Trump pretends to care because the pressure is on. My money is still on the N R A. He thinks the NRA IS WONDERFUL. The same org that blocked every attempt at gun control.
966818932156854272 2018-02-22 23:36:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump The emphasis should be On gun control. Children safety is code word for were leaving your guns alone. Will not solve the problem.
966725854171578368 2018-02-22 17:26:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If you arm teachers shooters will go to malls, theatres, churches, supermarkets etc.....
966724505635758080 2018-02-22 17:20:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Much easier to control guns than figure out who the next shooter will be.
966723783280046082 2018-02-22 17:18:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @NRA @realDonaldTrump The reason Congress has not passed these laws before is the NRA, NRA, NRA!!!!!!! #WeAreNotStupid
966720261738266624 2018-02-22 17:04:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Talk is cheap. My guess is EVIL NRA  WILL WIN AGAIN. Just waiting for the furor to subside.

966530114883211267 2018-02-21 04:28:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Your words are hollow. The laws to control guns have to come from the federal lever. We need for you to lead or GET OUT OF THE WAY!!!!!!
966528134093856768 2018-02-21 04:20:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We need to reinstate the assault weapons ban!!!!!!!!!!!
966527470634614785 2018-02-21 04:18:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You need to lead. You need to demand commons sense gun control. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS WILL NOT BLOW OVER!!!!!!!!!!!

966101637054939138 2018-02-20 00:05:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Nobody is "USING" them. They are smart, independent, articulate and brave. More than we can say for you. What does it say if you have to lie to make your point? Worthless gibberish.
966099030001401856 2018-02-20 23:55:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @washingtonpost This ban is a token gesture at  best. Did not pass after Vegas massacre. Pathetic.

966011689442267136 2018-02-20 18:08:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You are putting us into debt for short term gains. Possible inflation and hi int rates are looming.  It's good for you but not our future. It's politics as usual. All you care abt is being reelected.

965820883141931008 2018-02-19 05:30:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly What is cruel is saying after every massacre this is not the time to talk abt it. What you really mean is let it blow over. Maybe they'll forget. That is cruel, deceptive and self serving. That is one of the main reason the emotions run so hi. IT'S TIME TO B HONEST.
965459332694360064 2018-02-18 05:33:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If she runs against you she will squish you like bug. The plan is for her to campaign against G O P. YEAH! YEAH!
965361954905714688 2018-02-18 23:06:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Someday we will have a day without a Trump lie. Not today.
965278902875639808 2018-02-18 17:36:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @JohnKasich @President1Trump @SandraA69243408 @OldtexanKay This  the same as showing a 12 yr old year reading the rules of the road before driving his dads car over his cheating girlfriend. We are no going to throw all our regs on auto safety because they will not stop intentional misuse.
965277236340273152 2018-02-18 17:30:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @WalshFreedom That is his never waving M O. Find a scapegoat! "The buck stops anywhere but here" should b on a banner over the oval. office.
965080672762150912 2018-02-17 04:28:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Who else you are you going  to blame? Dems, FBI....
965067982429872128 2018-02-17 03:38:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Is that your best excuse for not doing  anything. Scraping the bottom  of the barrel. Maybe look for reasons to do it.  Just count the dead children.
964664028000788480 2018-02-16 00:53:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @kshering @WalshFreedom Pretty small of him????? He refused to enforce sanctions, and now he is sending a msg to Putiin, if I can I will have your back. Can you please help me in future elections . "Small"  My Ass! Even in ur criticism ur kissing his ass.
964579717901774848 2018-02-16 19:18:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @ProudResister @psorensen We are on the road to becoming a banana republic
964575827667988480 2018-02-16 19:02:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg If you are saying there should b barriers we agree. No guns to minors. Universal background checks No assault weapons
964574357333860352 2018-02-16 18:57:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @ProudResister Seemed like they went out of their way to show that Russians showed no bias. Hard to believe. Why bother?
964557503475236864 2018-02-16 17:50:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @SethMacFarlane There are 2 issues. The why and the how. There is no one answer to why. We know how they do it. GUNS. If we apply some common sense we can control the how. Let's deal with what we can control.
964552807192846337 2018-02-16 17:31:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Crime is down. No secret. Mass killings are way up. Common sense can not b ignored when it comes to gun control. NO MATTER THE SPIN.
964551554316382208 2018-02-16 17:26:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @ProudResister @psorensen Citizens United must be reversed.  Hard to convince people that votes matter when the real power lies in $. Even w/polls showing Dems way ahead big money is going to GOP.
964549372477243392 2018-02-16 17:17:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @ProudResister @psorensen We have 2 b realistic
964547382250635265 2018-02-16 17:09:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @ProudResister @psorensen I agree about assault weapons. The ban that lapsed s/b reinstated. Handguns s/b regulated, not banned.
964543791507038208 2018-02-16 16:55:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @ProudResister @psorensen So it's ok for an 18 yr old to buy a  gun w/o background check? How about a 6 yr driving? How about letting truck drivers drive 20 hrs a day (ok if he slams into ur car asleep)? Common sense does not apply to guns???
964521673494966272 2018-02-16 15:27:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @Brimshack @atpburke Somehow there is always money for guns.

964381352748400640 2018-02-15 06:10:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter We all hope so!
964375721152884738 2018-02-15 05:47:43 UTC <michaelkaf> If youre as bumed as I am about this shooting take comfort in the thought that when Dems win the House back gun reform will happen.

964299594396876802 2018-02-15 00:45:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @krassenstein When your parents used to say now is not the time. They actually met it ain't happening.
964297261755723776 2018-02-15 00:35:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @she_fights @PuppetPotus2020 @linda_voepel I heard an old gangbanger say thay in the old days a gang possessed 2-3 guns  today each member has that many.
964292359671267328 2018-02-15 00:16:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @she_fights @linda_voepel @PuppetPotus2020 Guns are specifically allowed in our cost. Guns are a big part of our history. At the same time we have to recognise that they are extremely lethal and should b treated accordingly.
964289077158723584 2018-02-15 00:03:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @she_fights @linda_voepel @PuppetPotus2020 Gun laws may not stop everyone. But they can stop many. We know that. After the ban on assault weapons was allowed to lapse mass  killings rose sharply.
964287015859585024 2018-02-15 23:55:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Its different if you throw punch, break  window or reach  for an assault weapons he bought at the store. If we don't take the gun out of his reach we share in the blame.
964285655332282368 2018-02-15 23:49:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Sometimes you can just deal with the symptoms. In this case the casual availability of guns.  We as a society need to show that we value life. Not only with words but actions. Actions that worked in other countries where they value life more than we do.
964272383765839873 2018-02-15 22:57:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly There is the why and the how. Why is complex. How is easier to fix. No assault weapons. Universal background checks.
964229324504145920 2018-02-15 20:06:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @lrnxbxtr @SippinSyrup05 @camerooof That is an excuse. Guns are lethal. They should be restricted and regulated. No assault weapons. MANDATORY background checks. We need to want to do it. It can b done. It has been done in many other countries.
964224552967356416 2018-02-15 19:47:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @StewardshipAmer  You are NRA
964219630368702465 2018-02-15 19:27:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @StewardshipAmer  you are not black you are a bot
964219437342638080 2018-02-15 19:26:42 UTC <michaelkaf> It is not  cruel to make law abiding citizens go through a rigorous background check b4 they can buy a gun. We prefer it. No diff than airport security. It is not a hardship not 2b able to own an assault weapon if it can save lives.
964216635186806784 2018-02-15 19:15:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer Any weapon that makes it easy to kill more people faster s/b made illigal. It Can B Done We Need The Will. We need to stop with the excuses.
964213323817340928 2018-02-15 19:02:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer Even in the wild West when everyone had a gun there were smart sheriffs  who made them  give them up when they came into town.
964209766326181888 2018-02-15 18:48:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @ZeitgeistGhost One more reason. If you are making money selling guns.
964209285256245248 2018-02-15 18:46:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer We need a solution. We can find it. Other countries have done so successfuly. We CAN do it. We need the will. You do not have the will. Sad.
964208103934722048 2018-02-15 18:41:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @she_fights @PuppetPotus2020 We agree. We can restrict and control guns. We can not control the desire to kill.
964206437919412224 2018-02-15 18:35:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly We have created a monster by making guns to readily available. We have more guns than people. We need drastic measures. There are good solutions out there. Many countries have solved that prooblem. We have the know-how we just need the will.
964202723313766400 2018-02-15 18:20:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer Law abiding citizens can have guns for protection and sport. They should b required to pass a background check. They do not need assault weapons!
964201295342010369 2018-02-15 18:14:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @she_fights @PuppetPotus2020 We  agree they are multipurpose tools that can kill and their use should b regulated and restricted.
964200327888084992 2018-02-15 18:10:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Empty hollow words that will not save a single life. You have the power to save lives you just don't have the balls
964199339370270720 2018-02-15 18:06:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @she_fights @PuppetPotus2020 Guns also have a self defense function. The point is guns need to b regulated as much as cars are if not more.
964198266396012544 2018-02-15 18:02:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer We have tried liberal gun laws and the results are not what any of us want. We have to make it tougher to get a gun. Universal background checks.There are illegal weapons. That list has to include assault weapons. They are not necessary.
964195293032980480 2018-02-15 17:50:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer So your solution is armed guards in schools. What about malls, movie theatres, restaurants.. Your solution will lead to every citizen carrying a gun. Law abiding or not. You are in the minority if that is your solution .
964191766625726464 2018-02-15 17:36:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer We are talking abt constitutional rights. Every const. right is abridged when it comes to public safety. The 2nd is also abridged, obviously not enough.
964188022068592640 2018-02-15 17:21:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer We are looking for solutions to mass killings. In Australia they found a bsolution that worked.
964186462106263552 2018-02-15 17:15:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer Constitutional rights are abridged when they endanger public safety. NO RIGHT IS ABSOLUTE. Our right to safety is also in the constitution. I HAVE to send my kids to school. You don't have to have an assault weapon.
964184567241367552 2018-02-15 17:08:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @PuppetPotus2020 @she_fights If there is a will there is a way. Unfortunately we have the NRA getting in the way. All over the world they have tougher gun laws and better results. It's easier to buy a gun than drive a car. Both lethal weapons.

964169374121656320 2018-02-15 16:07:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer The E Z availability of guns is a huge problem. I live in Chgo. All you have to do is travel outside city limits. They did it in Australia. Tough laws with tough penalties. Public safety trumps the 2nd. No right is absolute. Not even the right to bear arms.

964162937890906117 2018-02-15 15:42:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @StewardshipAmer That is a separate issue. The availability of assault weapons is something we can legislate. Can't pass a law to make people go to church on Sunday. Get real!
964162026296680448 2018-02-15 15:38:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly The EZ  availability of assault weapons is an issue that can b dealt with. Make them illigal.  stiff penalties. Same with large magazines.
964160389503070208 2018-02-15 15:32:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @PuppetPotus2020 @she_fights Assault weapons are specifically made to kill as many victims as possible. Why do we need them? Why?????
964021651980533761 2018-02-14 06:20:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @WalshFreedom Yeah gang bangers in CHGO don't have far to go to get guns. It's E Z. That s the problem. Why not check Australia?
964012229967282176 2018-02-14 05:43:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Translation: We aren't doing anything different. You can buy all the guns u want.
964009628248887296 2018-02-14 05:33:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly There are various causes and each has its solutions. The availability of guns is one cause that can b cured with common sense gun control.
964006229914763264 2018-02-14 05:19:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Its not a mystery. Australia applied strict gun laws and mass murders ceased.
964004320839548928 2018-02-14 05:11:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly What should b done? Assault weapons s/b  illegal. Universal background checks.  The correlation between the increase in guns and mass shootings is no coincidence.
963940847791218688 2018-02-14 00:59:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Prayers are not enough. Prayers are a code word for do nothing. Time to act.
963931915383226369 2018-02-14 00:24:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly As a society we have devalued human life.  We care more about guns than human life.

963926942863929345 2018-02-14 00:04:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @AlisonR61423986 We need to take money out of the equation. Bring back limits on contributions.

963919204570210304 2018-02-14 23:33:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly First he lied about congresswoman Wilson (no apology), then he covers up for a wife beater. He is the Chief of Staff at the U S WHITEHOUSE. The media should say let's give him a break. Like Porter gave his wives. He should b tarred and feathered.
963916082510675968 2018-02-14 23:21:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @AlisonR61423986 It's hopeless. GOP congressmen were shot while playing baseball. Some were hurt seriously. Their response was we need more  guns.

963550083034759168 2018-02-13 23:06:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Unfortunately the G O P has been forced into a position of backing Trump, right or wrong. If he sinks they will drown with him. In 2018 they will lose big. If they abandon Trump they will lose even bigger.  They will lose some deep red state support.

963532268512862208 2018-02-13 21:56:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly It may b clear to you but not at all factual. Nobody has demonstrated a $30 billion need for the wall. It will not solve the illegal immigration problem. And if you think it stop the flow of drugs you are crazy. That war is unwinable.

963190562449866752 2018-02-12 23:18:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @CPAC @realDonaldTrump Ask your conservative buddies how they view your spending and tax cuts which will raise our debt into record territories!!!!!
963188416589438976 2018-02-12 23:09:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly What is hard to believe is that a Trump supporter is actually complaining about vicious attacks. Trumps personal vicious attacks, lies, were his most effective campaigning tool. He debased his opponents as nauseum.  #HYPOCRACY
963104290930700288 2018-02-12 17:35:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @WestervillePD @JohnKasich @realDonaldTrump You do realize that the 2nd, like every other right guaranteed in our constitution, is not absolute. They are all abridged. Public safety is more important.
963103146951163904 2018-02-12 17:30:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @WestervillePD @JohnKasich @realDonaldTrump The tragedy is your empty phony rhetoric. If you cared you would something about all the gun massacres that have become a normal part of our daily lives. COMMON SENSE GUN CONTROL.  #NRABITCH.

963090382086029313 2018-02-12 16:40:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @BillOReilly We are in a self preservation mode. We want to destroy him b4 he destroys our future. He is destroying our   enviotnment. Inflation. Mountains of debt.. .
963087360677171200 2018-02-12 16:28:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Of course you would like the media ignore his personal situation. Maybe yours too. I do feel sorry for him. He never resorts to personal attacks.
963082185405120513 2018-02-12 16:07:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump If not for the Dems insistence that we also spend on domestic spending the opioid epidemic would b ignored. When you had the chance you chose to tackle the epidemic with empty words.
963081348134006784 2018-02-12 16:04:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump When the next recession hits and we will b forced into deficit spending that option will not b available b/c of the existing debt.
963080160667885568 2018-02-12 15:59:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You don't care what happens when you leave office. The growing mountain of of debt that you are ignoring will b disasterous.

962868958092083200 2018-02-11 02:00:23 UTC <michaelkaf> @SandraA69243408 President is blocking the dem memo because he is hiding the truth. The truth will out. Mueller will get his man. #LockHimUp
962866289248059392 2018-02-11 01:49:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @nytimes The admin is going for the world record of biggest liars ever. I think they will make it.

962720319709462529 2018-02-11 16:09:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @krassenstein What would b even more fun is an impeachment
962718558378606592 2018-02-11 16:02:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @JudgeJeanine It's a shame that the W H can't find any decent help. No one with public visibility would hire Porter.
962717097628393472 2018-02-11 15:56:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @JudgeJeanine I blame a 4* general because he covered up a crime. Porter is woman batterer that should have been fired on the spot.
962716233777913857 2018-02-11 15:53:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @JudgeJeanine Your right this Obamas fault. 
962714807857160193 2018-02-11 15:47:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @JudgeJeanine Kelley knew about him a months ago. Porter is a criminal and a security risk. Susceptible to blackmail. People working this close to pres should b vetted thoroughly. Obviously he was not. A disgrace.
962572239840268288 2018-02-10 06:21:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @WestervillePD @realDonaldTrump @ShennaFoxMusic The queen (witch) of spin (lies). She says that our fake pres is moron and that's why his fans voted for him. Just don't ask her how she knows that. At least she is right about the moron part.
962501591021510656 2018-02-10 01:40:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Your administration is not negotiating in good faith. You are holding DACA hostage. You have lost cred. You are all about political gain at all cost. #WeAreNotStupid

Give our police officers better odds fighting criminals. MANDATORY UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. ASSAULT WEAPONS AND LARGE MAGAZINES ILLEGAL.
962473022622855169 2018-02-10 23:47:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @Reuters Takes one to know one. I thought he was only supposed to redact security  sensitive data.
962471863564713985 2018-02-10 23:42:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @AppleCiderRadio @IrisRimon Not my president. My conscience is clear.
962467956763406337 2018-02-10 23:26:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @JTMann05 We don't need an agenda. The anti Trump tsunami will taken us home.
962467210601021440 2018-02-10 23:23:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Who do you think created DACA? OBAMA (democrat?) when Congress couldn't get it together to pass an immigration bill. Just like today. With your capable leadership it will b done as soon as he'll freezes over.
962465160949514241 2018-02-10 23:15:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Once upon a time I had some doubt as to your guilt. Over time that doubt has disipated. With your blocking of the Democratic memo I have absolutely no doubt as to your guilt. Your a fool. You know it will b leaked. Rightfully so.
962463487317299200 2018-02-10 23:09:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler @MarlaWeezie All of the above.
962393342733512704 2018-02-10 18:30:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If you really want to b vindicated let Mueller question you on prime time TV. Think of the ratings. Oh yes, you could also release your tax returns.
962380629353447425 2018-02-10 17:39:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump American spies were attempting to recover stolen intellegence. THEY WERE DOING THEIR JOB TO KEEP US SAFE. You lie and smear them to distract us from the truth . You are proving your guilt. #WeAreNotStupid.

962372270063697920 2018-02-10 17:06:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @TheRealJuIian What is your definition of the "entire world"?  #WeAreNotStupid

962366977649008640 2018-02-10 16:45:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Interesting how you quote @nytimes when u want 2b believed, yet you watch FOX all the time. I guess they tell you want to hear.
962365458757304320 2018-02-10 16:39:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump It's a good thing that your administration has appointed a good man to get to the bottom of this. LET MUELLER DO HIS JOB SO WE CAN DRAIN THE SWAMP (you).
962358612285833216 2018-02-10 16:12:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If you chose to be in public service you do so with the premise that the skeletons in your closet will b outed. You should have thought of that b4 you ran 4 the highest office in the land. #CharacterMatters
962356928142700544 2018-02-10 16:05:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump There is no due process in the court of public opinion. You have chosen to manipulate public opinion with lies and spin. The verdict is in. If you live by the sword you shall die by the sword. #WeAreNotStupid

962208884747153408 2018-02-09 06:17:29 UTC <michaelkaf> So who are you going to blame for the tax cut THAT COST $1.4? You blamed Obama for his deficit. This deficit is all yours.
962202540828839936 2018-02-09 05:52:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @ColumbiaBugle So which is better mishandling classified or giving it to the Russians. Which is better being tough on Russia or seeing no fault in anything they do to us. Might as well just bend over and smile.
962199466890571776 2018-02-09 05:40:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @ColumbiaBugle Hillary deleted personal emails. G O P initiated and also funded dossier that was LEGAL opposition research. Most of it was coraborated.  Hillary has been investigated. No one indicted. Can Donny say that?
962195556666769408 2018-02-09 05:24:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler Which will come first his tax retutns or the interacted memo?
962194325089038336 2018-02-09 05:19:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler What a shock. Disgusting, disgraceful Donny going back on his word. You can trust him as far you can throw him. #SlimeBall
962113670078590976 2018-02-09 23:59:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @glennbeck @BillOReilly What about the volatile stock market. Obama's fault? 
962113066560180224 2018-02-09 23:56:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @glennbeck @BillOReilly The next big story is inflation, debt & America alone.
962112143301595136 2018-02-09 23:53:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Don t act so innocent you do to MSM and FBI.
962010688259481600 2018-02-09 17:09:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly If by "doing it" you mean telling the truth than your absolutely right. Mueller is seeking the truth and Trump and his cronies are attempting to block him. They know he is guilty. Even your talented spin won't help.
962007853761310720 2018-02-09 16:58:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly The real corruption is rooted in our unethical, immoral fake pres. He has singlehandedly sunk the moral leadership of our country. The world no longer looks up to us.
961987546178711552 2018-02-09 15:37:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump This excessive  spending and unpaid for tax cuts will mean ballooned debt, hi debt service, hi int rates, hyper inflation, a volatile stock market and slow growth. Well done.
961984000813223937 2018-02-09 15:23:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We spend more for our military than the next 7 countries combined. Fucked up priorities.
961983138757931009 2018-02-09 15:20:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump It's a matter of priorities. The Dems care about the people and the Republicans dont. While u want to spend billions on a wall &the military the Dems want disaster relief, DACA and domestic programs.Your tax cuts were not paid for so hi int rates & inflation will b on your head.
961832981152251905 2018-02-08 05:23:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @DonaldJTrumpJr You wish. Stop dreaming. The one going down the Watergate road is you read and your going down with him.
961817752779370498 2018-02-08 04:23:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The magicians do that. It's called misdirection. You may fool some of your die-hard core believers but Mueller isn't being detured. He is coming for you. This time your hi paid lawyers will not help. #LockHimUp.

961780650708688896 2018-02-08 01:55:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You are constantly battling demons you have created. The economy at full employment needed a boost. Fake News. So is the immigrants as being evil is a fear of your creation. You will b devoured by these demons.

961404339439812608 2018-02-07 01:00:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Being president will garner you 30% approval ratings. Booming economy should give u 35% more. You are at 38%. What does that say?  We're not buying your lies. #WeAreNotStupid

961387829904453632 2018-02-07 23:54:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump What about DACA? You still holding that hostage for the wall most Americans don't want. You don't care abt them they are not white. And you are no Obama.

961349824040747008 2018-02-07 21:23:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The only suspicious new info  was the the fact that the FBI delayed for a month the announcement about the discovery of more emails. It came at the worst time for Clinton and cost her the election. FBI was biased for who?????

His job creation record was better than Trump and longer lasting. It lead to the current boom. Trumps econ policy is reckless. Could lead to hi int rates and inflation. Increase the debt. Widen wealth gap.
961261344329687040 2018-02-07 15:32:18 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The bad news is you. Your juicing up the economy for political gains. Stimulating the econ at full employment is asking for trouble. Inflation, hi not rates and then a recession.

Just for the record they have taxes withheld for which they get no credit. No Soc. Sec. No medicare. No unemployment comp. If they file a false tax return they can go to jail.

958856999050997761 2018-01-31 00:18:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @chrislhayes He hasn't been acting super innocent for a long time. He is so obvious it's hard to believe anyone is doubting his guilt. My only doubt is whether  Mueller will  b able to make a compelling case against him.   The suspense is crazy.....
958839874424991744 2018-01-31 23:10:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @robreiner We need your voice!
958745645547905024 2018-01-31 16:55:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @VP As to "largest tax cut", Corps & rich got the lions share. The rest of us got scraps. We also got a bill for $1.5 tril. BHO wanted a "paid for" Corp tax cut by raising tax on rich but GOP said no way.  #WeAreNotStupid
958730567943507968 2018-01-31 15:55:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @VP Did not hear "thanks Obama" from our fake pres. BHO took over when we were losing 750K jobs a mo. He turned it around despite the worst obstructionist Congress ever. His job creation numbers were better than Donny's same as approval ratings. #WeAreNotStupid #SpinelessOne
958593524982743040 2018-01-30 06:51:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @elizabethforma Please, pleasd, please run for pres. Your time has come.
958591717657202688 2018-01-30 06:44:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump I did not watch. I hope you will forgive me. I do believe that actions speak louder than words. Especially if they are your words(lies). So really why bother. Even if you do mean it. An hour later someone will change your mind. #resign #WeAreNotStupid
958507890410582016 2018-01-30 01:11:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Your very good at this PR and polishing your image. Who doesn't like a cute doggie? Don't forget we have seen behind the curtain. #WeAreNotStupid
958505846891098113 2018-01-30 01:02:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @newsmax @BillOReilly With Trump We have only become much more divided. It's because of what he says and what he does. The damage is done. His cred is gone.  No one will believe him no matter what he says. #StopTheSpin #StopTheLies. #Resign
958486161743212544 2018-01-30 23:44:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @courierjournal @POTUS @SenateMajLdr How do you reconcile a 38% approval rating with a booming economy? #WeAreNotStupid
958484965779361792 2018-01-30 23:39:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @courierjournal @POTUS @McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr You have gotten us out of the Paris accord. You have removed regs that protect consumers. You removed regs that protect us from pollution and carcinogens. We are losing our leading role in the world. #AmericaAlone. Your  increasing the debt.......
958482563298832384 2018-01-30 23:30:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @JoyceWhiteVance @WendyJoGraham People are desperate for a change. We voted for Obama b/c he offered hope. They voted for Donald b/c he is an outsider who promised  to drain the swamp. All these votes were for a change from a system where more & more we feel helpless to the powers that b.
958479523003027456 2018-01-30 23:18:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @krassenstein Sounds like something the Donald would do. "Have lawyer will travel".
958441682151723009 2018-01-30 20:47:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @NoSpinNews @BillOReilly So your definition of "acting presidential"' is reading a prepared speech. Wow. Most of us have given up on Donald ever being close to presidential. He has succeeded in making a laughing stock out of the US.
958439439054729216 2018-01-30 20:39:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @NoSpinNews @BillOReilly Today headlines come fast and fade faster. You don't need 2 b a stable genius to predict that. Your previous employer FOX confirmed the fact that Trump wanted to fire Mueller. Anyone, unbiased, with half a brain can see that DT is guilty as sin. He is sweating bullets.
958426580610514944 2018-01-30 19:47:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @krassenstein I smell the stench of fascim.  VOTE! VOTE! VOTE!
958184500889964544 2018-01-29 03:46:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Youre the one that's clueless. You did nothing to reduce  black unemplyment. You are taking credit for Obama's stimulus and low int rates. And shifting the blame to anyone but you. BTW job creation in 2017 was less than 2016.
958179702614585345 2018-01-29 03:26:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @RepAdamSchiff Can you spell fascism?
958137833843179520 2018-01-29 00:40:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Why don't you tell us what you have done specifically to improve black unemployment. Nothing, nada, zilch. You are one lucky bastard.
958134495168806912 2018-01-29 00:27:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Economic growth started  during the previous admin. The changes you  made will cause irreparable damage to our future. Pollution will  get worse.  Global warming will become more catastrophic. Consumer protection diluted. Additional 1.5 trill. of debt. Rich gettinh richer....
958129629327314944 2018-01-29 00:07:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump BLACK MAIL!!!! You rescinded DACA to use it yo get your WALL.  #WeAreNotStupid
957097004005560320 2018-01-26 03:44:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @krassenstein It's criminal. He can't get away with it. They can't get away with it. Mueller must do his job.
956988430424203264 2018-01-26 20:33:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Disgusting Donald, you pretend to care about these innocent dreamers. You are so transparent. If you hadnt been so lucky with the economy your approval rating would b in single digits. #WeAreNotStupid
956986180360392709 2018-01-26 20:24:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You could have  left DACA alone but you rescinded it. Now you r using it as blackmail like a common criminal. Shameless. #WeAreNotStupid
956764325057675265 2018-01-25 05:42:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @OfficialJonZal Usually they ignore any misstatements that they make.
956692318605672448 2018-01-25 00:56:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @BernardGoldberg I think the better concern is about having a pres with a slimy immoral unethical personality. He lies all the time. WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT. #SAD

956400561661804544 2018-01-24 05:37:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @washingtonpost It is OK to say "shithole" when describing our fake presidents mouth.
956399762315661312 2018-01-24 05:34:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Nothing much has changed except for the stock market. What goes up must come down. Job creation has actually gone down from 2016. Can't imagine GDP will keep going at this rate with your isolationist policies. The debt is definitely scary. We've always been number one.#resign.
956364785888710656 2018-01-24 03:15:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Are you giving that advice away  for free?  Here is s couple of tips for you. When you go outside on a cold day put  on a coat. When it's raining take an umbrella.
956300977463873541 2018-01-24 23:01:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @JasonKander He has no opinion. He defers to the N   R A.
956291729489088512 2018-01-24 22:24:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @thinkprogress I would like him to take a lie detector test. He is obviously lying.
956229579760431109 2018-01-24 18:17:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @FBI @BillOReilly "Beset with corruption" is unfair and inflammatory.

956004410118869000 2018-01-23 03:23:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Supporting add'l military sprnding  is a slick political move. It makes you seem patriotic. Tough 2 beat that. Never mind  that our military is mightier than any other on earth. By far. We spend more on our military more than the next 7 countries combined.

955865335714013184 2018-01-23 18:10:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @missmayim It's unfortunate that these killings have become an mundane part of our day to day lives. The shock has diminished. The obvious power of the NRA is impenetrable. Very frustrating.
955852235640135680 2018-01-23 17:18:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly They oppose the scare and panic tactics and lies(propaganda). The crime stats don't support the hysteria. All we got from our drug wars is bloated prisons. We need tough humane immigration enforcement and legalized regulated and taxed narcotics. No road to citizenship.
955834161989849089 2018-01-23 16:06:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You do realize that we have the best military in the world. No one is even close. If u add in our allies in NATO our might is undeniable. SO HITTING THE PANIC BOTTON abt the military is STUPID. #WeAreNotStupid

955825078561800192 2018-01-23 15:30:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The Dems fought for CHIP & DACA. They got one and they will get the other soon. They succeeded in showing your hypocricy. All without shutting the gov't. In my book that's a big win.

955512360600526849 2018-01-22 18:47:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump As soon as you resign or are impeached. As soon as you start listening to all of the people. Everything you are backing  is apposed by the majority.
955511107082481665 2018-01-22 18:42:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Everyone agrees that the DACA people should b taken care of. But when it comes to action you and the  G O P are MIA. LYING hypocrites. #sad #WeAreNotStupid

955287841680117760 2018-01-21 03:55:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter Obama issued DACA because it was the right thing  to do. He had no choice. Congress was obstructionist. Everybody admits it's the right thing. The GOP does not want to lose their hard core base and support DACA at same time. Impossible. WeAreNotStupid
955281899664134144 2018-01-21 03:32:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @WalshFreedom Obama was forced into action by an obstructionist intransigent congress. It was the humane thing to do.

955247092674514944 2018-01-21 01:13:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @greenhousenyt Seems fair. A bonus from the boss for a job well done. Money talks and s**t walks.
955243998842585091 2018-01-21 01:01:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @thinkprogress All are pointing their fingers at the Donald. They squirm all the while as he laughs.
955243025042739205 2018-01-21 00:57:39 UTC <michaelkaf> I think they  call that income taxes.
955236805879660545 2018-01-21 00:32:56 UTC <michaelkaf> You do it over and  over again. You chose anectidal evidence to support your views. That is bogus. Being brash and salty doesn't prove anything either. You appeal to raw bias an ignorance.
955217685050286080 2018-01-21 23:16:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @RedTRaccoon I have never seen so much of the criticism of an administration come from its own party. It's a wake up call if your own people say "you suck".
955198312768040964 2018-01-21 21:59:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg Maybe the voters are not that stupid. Maybe they realize that the foundation for the economic boom was due to Obama's policies. Maybe we know that Trumps actions come with a price; deficit, global warming, pollution, global isolation, increase in  wealth gap....
955195170181566465 2018-01-21 21:47:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg It's not only the Democrats who object to GOP ideas. They keep backing unpopular themes; Repeal&Repl. exit from Paris Accord, wall(NOT paid for by Mex.). TAX PLAN, rescind DACA, offshore drilling, trashing EPA&State dept. Iran pact....

954501023611146241 2018-01-19 23:49:12 UTC <michaelkaf> Truth is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. You cherry pick and distort. In other words lie. You attack the messenger and ignore the argument. That's circumventing the truth.
954498287305940992 2018-01-19 23:38:20 UTC <michaelkaf> A conservative friend of mine told me that Trump is our president and we need to support him. I retorted, is that how u felt about Obama. He responded by calling Obama a bunch of explatives.

954492634906746880 2018-01-19 23:15:52 UTC <michaelkaf> Dems do not resent rich. Some of the richest people are Dems. We resent the growing wealth gap. Taxes should b fair. TOTAL taxes are more burdensome on the 99%. Trickle down does not work. Money in the hands of wealthy moves slower and and more often is invested abroad.

954052266117554185 2018-01-18 18:06:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @thinkprogress Being egotistical does not preclude one from being a racist. On a one to one basis he is egotistical. But his view on the black race as a whole is obvious and transparent. Even if he only uses racism to appeal to his base it is just as ugly.
954048361631494147 2018-01-18 17:50:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @ProudResister There are 2 issues.  1- Illegal immigration. That flow has been stemmed. 2- Drugs. All agree that battle has been lost. The only solution is legalize and regulate.  Conclusion: no justification to spend 30 bil.    Majority against it so TRUMP will fight for it.

You can look at immigrants and see the criminals and misfits. You can look at immigrants as productive citizens that enrich us.  What happened to the Christian charity and goodwill? For whites only.
953287217966927872 2018-01-16 15:25:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump It was negative. But true. You are a lousy pres and a disgusting human being that thrives on attention (ratings). No one is crying for you. "If u don't like the heat get out of the kitchen".

952207565169053698 2018-01-13 15:55:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @sarahkendzior Very telling. In comparison to all his other depraved activity extramarital consensual sex with a pornstar seems trivial. WOW. #IMPEACH #RESIGN.
952052062879211520 2018-01-12 05:37:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You do realize that from now on the only reason we will listen to you is for entertainment. I gotta say you do make us laugh. NOBODY WILL TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY ANY MORE.   
952042591620616193 2018-01-12 05:00:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly You've obviously not made enough redtitution.
952041199703068673 2018-01-12 04:54:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @krassenstein With Trump this scandal is just same old, same old. If this happened to Obama it would b a earth shattering SHOCK.  We have become so numb to his abhorrent behavior that nobody is surprised. When Mueller puts the  cuffs on him most of us we'll say "I told you so."
951962486042976258 2018-01-12 23:41:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We need to take of our people. Quality of life matters. Not just for the 1%.
951961186169507841 2018-01-12 23:36:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We have gotten a good look into  your character. We will not b shocked with anything Mueller finds out about you no matter how heinous. #resign
951959568489353217 2018-01-12 23:30:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Lies, lies, LIES.  You are  a racist shit whole. Tough language? TRUTH.  So u r going to keep threatening the Dems with DACA. SHAMEFUL.
951891911891210243 2018-01-12 19:01:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly You can claim to b fair and unbiased. We heard all the excuses. Now it's time for action. We can no longer tolerate Trump to be our pres. He must go. He has about as much respect as a lying criminal. Which he is.
951889486841073665 2018-01-12 18:51:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @bmangh @EdKrassen Well stated
951888500164579328 2018-01-12 18:47:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @molly_knight I know how he feels.
951887980775591936 2018-01-12 18:45:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @Nikluk @KristinKarnitz He maybe very unpopular but since he became pres. the GOP has raised way more money than the Dems. His tax bill insured the support of the wealthy. He is not stupid. We must fight him relentlessly!
951885210668421121 2018-01-12 18:34:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @Nikluk @KristinKarnitz The man must yield enormous power over them. One theory may be that he has the support of the big donors. As was witnessed with BANNON. Or  they realize that if they don't show a united front 2018 will b a huge bloodbath. Slim chance but only chance.
951882502452465665 2018-01-12 18:24:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter Why don't you show the way. Well pitch in for your ticket.

951880776039260160 2018-01-12 18:17:16 UTC <michaelkaf> Shithole countries, Donald Trumps latest racist tirade, explainedhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/12/16882840/donald-trump-shithole-daca
951880100345253888 2018-01-12 18:14:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly We sre not judging him based on one statement. He has of racial bias.
951870784510808065 2018-01-12 17:37:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly His isolationist approach will cause us to lose trading partners. His policy of favoring the wealthy will continue shrinking the mid class. This too will slow down the economy. The stock market can not go up for ever. A correction is overdue. Could happen 2018.
951868533289385984 2018-01-12 17:28:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Doesn't he realize if he keeps this up 2018 will b a blood bath for the GOP. This means a good chance for impeachment.
951867820270374913 2018-01-12 17:25:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly You know for a small fleeting moment I thought that this time we will hear an apology.  Even if he made a "mistake" that offended a lot of people he needs to apologise. His refusal proves that he is callous and stupid. He won't b happy till the GOP  is totally sunk.
951864319603552257 2018-01-12 17:11:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly We have good reasons for hating him. Our disdain is fact based. Unlike his racist biased. This is not the first of last time he made a "mistake". Lousy spin but you get a C for trying. Told you that you wont b able to spin it. Your defense of him also soils you.
951862297760329729 2018-01-12 17:03:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @VP We have to take care of all our ppl. We need same priorities. To spend billions on a wall when illegal immigration is at an all time low is insane. Stupid promises are not binding. We have fought the drug wars for decades and lost. Time to try something besides filling r jails.

We need to increase immigration not lower our quotas. We need skilled labor as well as blue collar as well as entrepenurs. Hi % of entrep. among immigrants.

951703723646087168 2018-01-11 06:33:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Yes, I am sure that's it. Or is it the same reason you don't have rallied in CA, NY, Chgo, NJ, MA., PA. etc. Your not welcome there. Boos don't make for good sound bites on the 11 p.m. News.

951697756191641600 2018-01-11 06:10:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @MamaBearKrissie It's simple math. To win a national race he would need more than just the Republicans. He doesn't even have that. You need a good chunk of the independents. He polls lousy among indepedents. Right now the only way he would win is if spent his billions buying votes.
951648854486802432 2018-01-11 02:55:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @MamaBearKrissie You can't win anything with just the support of conservatives. He is going down. This will b similar to the Roy Moore loss except much bigger. We are not Alabama.

Even if she is perfect for the job Trump burned that bridge and rightfully so. If  we learned anything from DT it is that  we need someone capable and sane.
951518470579085317 2018-01-11 18:17:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @ChrisCuomo @KellyannePolls We talk about Russia assaulting our election. Confirmed by  U S Intel. Some call act of war. You ignore and talk about HRC.  You act so guilty that one has to wonder......

951510743857487872 2018-01-11 17:46:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Do we really need to borrow  $30 billion from China to build a wall?  No wonder they are laughing at us (mostly you). China will turn off that spigot. Can u blame them?

951280308686606336 2018-01-10 02:31:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @VP Why start now? You have done everything against the will of the people. People don't want the wall. They like ACA. They didn't like the tax plan. People want the Paris Accord. We don't need offshore drilling....
951246232080568320 2018-01-10 00:15:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Taking care of the present and ignoring and abusing our future is destructive. We will pay for it bigly. Global warming will cost billions. Oil spills will destroy our coastlines and oceans. Coal is carcegenoc.

951113018120732672 2018-01-10 15:26:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Sounds like you want Mueller out. I don't blame you. Seems like he is getting close to putting you in stripes.  It ain't going to happen. You will pay the price.
950952558566281217 2018-01-09 04:48:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You are about as resolute as a fart in the wind.

950792486892515328 2018-01-09 18:12:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @BillOReilly We have ample testimony of him being unfit for office from both sides of the aisle. There are many Americans including lawmakers who waiting with fear and apprehension. What is he going to do next.
950784588267343872 2018-01-09 17:41:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @kylegriffin1 Will this will b another "Roy Moore" fiasco? We can only hope.

950775006539239425 2018-01-09 17:03:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @washingtonpost Are they afraid he would say something stupid? Are they afraid he might implicate himself? Not to worry he is a Stable Genius who has nothing to hide. Just ask him.
950772221240324096 2018-01-09 16:52:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly If you learned to play golf you would be on par with out president. Maybe u could teach Donny how to keep his mouth shut.
950770566650384385 2018-01-09 16:45:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Why do we need so much "analysis"of Trumps rhetoric. What you really mean is "spin". We've had almost 2 years of it. Enough to understand that he is unstable and dangerous. The only saving grace is that few take him seriously. An infant who wants attention.
950613416879775745 2018-01-08 06:21:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @JohnDalyBooks @BernardGoldberg So? Why did Putin pick Donald? Why did Donald not slam Putin for assaulting our election? Why did he fire Comey? Why is Donald attacking Mueller/FBI? Most of the Dossier has been varified. No collusion?really?

950139944705634305 2018-01-07 22:59:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @TyJuanOn Really??? Let's stay on course and stop giving munitions to the opposition.
950138847500865537 2018-01-07 22:55:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @TyJuanOn Who cares? I can see that the press is desperate for Trump News. Let's keep our perspective. We know that our fake pres. Is s draft dodger. He desrves full blame. Leave his grandpa out of it. This is s talking point for the right.
950113960254230529 2018-01-07 21:16:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @DarrellIssa  Did you really approve offshore drilling off the CA coast because the lights are about to go out. Even a MORON is not buying that spin. You are going down when the SS Trump sinks.

950107687622242304 2018-01-07 20:51:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump I hope and pray. Please! Please! Please! Don't label FOX as corrupt or biased. 
950105947938197504 2018-01-07 20:44:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump I can hardly wait. I will immediately if not sooner stop watching the most fake media outlet as judged by our esteem fake pres. 
950060672603258881 2018-01-07 17:44:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The truth is that except for the spin masters who are on your payroll you have very little support for your lies and your immoral, unethical behavior. Your history and your own words paint a gross picture. #resign
950051562415624192 2018-01-07 17:08:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @washingtonpost Of course he does. He has lost the support of Merecer. His sugar daddy. He is like a child who messed up and lost his allowance. He needs to grow a spine if he is to retain any cred.
950049308908322816 2018-01-07 16:59:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You poor baby. There has been no credible denials to the allocations in the press and in the book. Calling it fake is bogus and does not say anything. When there is so much smoke there must be a fire.

949657829555757056 2018-01-06 15:04:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly You can not separate the man from his charachter. As Berny pointed out he is vindictive. He has it in for Obama big time so what ever he did Trump is undoing. This is no way to run a country. ACA, DACA, Paris Accord, fed land protection.

949509713141563392 2018-01-05 05:15:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump He is right about one thing. You are the least believed person on the planet. The truth is 180* from you. One more thing. You do act like a spoiled rotten kid who needs constant affirmation or  you throw a fit. We've seen it. Don't need the book to know that.

949380136566173696 2018-01-05 20:40:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @thinkprogress The right is always about a mile behind the times. Gay marriage, abortions, civil rights and now marijuana. I am tired of waiting 4 them to catch up.

949076382067429378 2018-01-04 00:33:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl You have it ass backwards. 8 years of stimulus and low int rates despite GOP admitted obstruction. Obama got us out of worse recession ever during worldwide econ. recession. Right now we have worldwide econ. expansion.
949074403748401152 2018-01-04 00:25:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You are using this economic success to go against what people want. You better listen. When the stock market goes down you will be out there without a net. SPLAT!

947558746003263488 2017-12-31 20:03:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @tedlieu @SandraRoggero We must continue the fight for truth. Even as it seems futile.
947557401695268865 2017-12-31 19:57:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @SandraRoggero @tedlieu He lies because he knows that his core base would believe ANYTHING he says. He is also in the camp of those who believe that a lie oft repeated begins to sound like the truth.
947553789166456833 2017-12-31 19:43:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The changes you effected this will b bad for our future. We beg you to consider long term effects. You r like a bull in China Shop looking for a piece of steak.  You will  find your pice of meat and  leave the mess for someone else to clean up.
947225595703947264 2017-12-30 21:59:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @alfranken Run for president.
947162758365220866 2017-12-30 17:49:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpPoll If the criticism is justified, yes, why not. I just don't trust his motivation.
947153804511891457 2017-12-30 17:13:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @samstein Do you remember when Obama was wearing golf shoes at the meeting when they were observing the capture of Osama bin Laden. The right claimed he had nothing to do with his kill.
947151909638598661 2017-12-30 17:06:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @samstein I don't care either. Everyone is enjoying winter break. Why does he have to lie about  it?
947127536550666242 2017-12-30 15:29:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg @DarwinPowell Obstruction of justice, emoluments clause, I am sure knowing Trumps history Mueller will find plenty to hang him with. The man acts guilty as Sin.
947125571020042241 2017-12-30 15:21:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg @Wirrack Trump is the least popular president ever while the economy is booming is a sure sign that 2018 will b a very BLUE year.
947055781492527104 2017-12-30 10:44:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @RoseAnnDeMoro They have managed health care that is much cheaper than ours. We pay the most without the results to show for it.
947051298649669632 2017-12-30 10:26:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We are the only country in the world debating global warming. Do you know the dif. between weather and climate. Might as well join The Flat Earth Society.
946977708810096640 2017-12-29 05:34:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg Yes, we progressives would like to see him impeached because he is bad for the US. Also he is an embarrassment. Whatever happened to "character counts"?
946975880865370113 2017-12-29 05:26:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg A small correction. We, having an ounce of intelligence and a tiny bit of  common sense believe that there is a   good chance that there was collusion  The fat lady has not sung yet. I would not b shocked if Muller puts the cuffs on him.
946971223526985728 2017-12-29 05:08:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @BernardGoldberg There is a simple explanation. We are not stupid! We are not stupid! We thank Obama for doing the heavy lifting so DT can take credit. You don't need to b a great judge of character to know that DT is  pure scum.
946958567575343104 2017-12-29 04:18:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly You are still king of BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN. Too bad J  Stuart will no longer b caught dead with u on the samr stage. That was a great debate.
946955303026941952 2017-12-29 04:05:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Yes. The truth is no longer relevant. We can have a difference of opinion. But there is no denying the truth. The word for 2017 -  DOUBLESPEAK .

946857618278174720 2017-12-29 21:37:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveKBannon Blah, blah, blah. Your populism movement is good for no one. Your pretend DC cleansing approach has only enlarged the swamp bigly. Your eroding of consumer protection is antipopulist. Your abandoning of our environment is abhorent. GO AWAY!
946828702947692545 2017-12-29 19:42:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Very convenient. Just like we are waiting for the definitive proof of your innocence. WE'RE STILL WAITING. I will promise you the moon tomottow as long as tomorrow never comes. #wearenotstupid

946583337136738309 2017-12-28 03:27:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @NBCNews @TheMadHessian U & I know that even if Menendez resigned Trump would not do the honorable thing. We know he ain't honorble. 2018 will b a bloodbath. How bad do u have 2b to have the lowest approval ratings ever when the stock market is on a tear.
946576222238191617 2017-12-28 02:58:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @NBCNews @TheMadHessian Menendez had his day in court. Can't wait till Mueller gets Donald. I have never seen anyone act so guilty.
946573986426687493 2017-12-28 02:49:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @NBCNews @TheMadHessian Can't believe your siding with Donald on this?  Are all his accusers liars? Even the grey haired lady which the honorable DT claims was too ugly for him. "Charachter counts" used to b a GOP motto.

946467454175367168 2017-12-28 19:46:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Yes you have. Your solutions are not working. Picking on Kim was irresponsible and ineffective. Sanctions not working.

946145500557955072 2017-12-27 22:27:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @VP Job creation is the same as Obama's.  Caused by 8 yrs of stimuli and low int rates. Also world wide economic expansion. Isis fight was Obama's plan. No diff if HRC won.
946143919305297922 2017-12-27 22:21:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @VP Repeal of individual mandate will cause premiums to rise people will drop out. 13 million according to CBO. Also gov't costs will rise. All around great move!

945140495944245248 2017-12-24 03:53:48 UTC <michaelkaf> In the height of the over the top PC era Happy Holidays was the preferred greeting. This was done in the  Christian spirit  of love thy neighbor.  RT if we need more of that spirit on this special day.
945138625951551488 2017-12-24 03:46:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Merry Christmas was dropped for the more PC inclusive Happy Holidays. This was nothing against anyone or anything. It was in the Christian spirit of love thy neighbor . How ghastly! We can use more of that now.
945034923643203584 2017-12-24 20:54:18 UTC <michaelkaf> @hobbitj I find myself wanting to scream and punch someone in the face. Preferably some fat old dude with orange hair.

944969560964370432 2017-12-24 16:34:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @hobbitj Yes, that s true in the extreme. On the whole its a systematic problem. If the politicians cant get reelcted w/o selling their soul to the devil things will only get worse. EPA will die. Consumer protection is being crushed. The rich will get richer.

You do stupid evil deeds and you wonder why your base is shrinking. You are not listening to what people are saying. It's not only abt jobs. You are destroying our quality of life. Leave EPA alone.
944807359871901697 2017-12-23 05:50:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @jstallman @nytimes They said the same thing about global warmimg. When big money is involved the truth gets crushed.
944806495018942464 2017-12-23 05:46:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg  Bernie, Bernie, Bernie. How could a smart Jewish boy like you not see what a major f**k up Donald is. Really??? Is it the $? Shame on you.
944805428004827136 2017-12-23 05:42:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @BernardGoldberg The winners were the voters in Alabama. Also all the people in yhe US who believe that DT can and will be defeated and/or impeached.
944804374118895616 2017-12-23 05:38:11 UTC <michaelkaf> Have I told you I really like your picture. Kudos to your photographer. You ooze confidence, intelligence and innocence. Blue is a very good color for you
944801223194173440 2017-12-23 05:25:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @SpeakerRyan @Biff_Copher Lower taxes is a good thing if it doesn't create a $1.5 trillion in debt. If it doesn't mean that to pay for it they're going to "fix" Social Sec. & Medicare. Bend over and get ready....
944799747159855104 2017-12-23 05:19:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @SpeakerRyan Dont you mean for Corporations. Oops I forgot SOTUS said they are people too.
944797080102625280 2017-12-23 05:09:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter I know you didn't  mean it as it sounds. But at its face value it is factual. Henceforth they shall be dubbed the antipopulist party. If the maases hate it the GOP will vote for it. Let them eat cake.
944795785409056768 2017-12-23 05:04:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @NoNoNotNormal @funder That is the GOP MO. They investigate ad nauseam. Bin Ghazi, Clinton emails, Clinton Found'n, Obama tapping Trump Tower, voter fraud....
944794264877371392 2017-12-23 04:58:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @LauraSexAngel Peace and goodwill to you too.
944792930455351296 2017-12-23 04:52:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly @JimVoto1 That s telling him. Good one.
944790565899644929 2017-12-23 04:43:18 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump I have a feeling you will be playing a lot of golf in 2018. Nobody is going to ask you to campaign for them. Not even at the border.
944789508180070401 2017-12-23 04:39:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @JohnPaul_USA Just like Roy Moore. Have Donald go on the stump for you. You'll do as good as him 32% 
944788364930306048 2017-12-23 04:34:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Guess what happens when you lose your majority? YOU WILL BE IMPEACHED! HA HA HA HA 
944787541814906880 2017-12-23 04:31:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter @RAMRANTS I think they're paid for.
944786765319168000 2017-12-23 04:28:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump History tells us that with your approval ratings you will lose bigly. I can't wait!
944608721275117573 2017-12-23 16:40:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @robreiner HAPPY HOLIDAYS, MEATHEAD
944424494038441989 2017-12-22 04:28:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @yogagenie @CassieCasanova Oh please don't block me.
944424298835570688 2017-12-22 04:27:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @yogagenie @CassieCasanova I know your pedigree goes way back but that does not give you the right to tell anyone to go back....
944420084155547649 2017-12-22 04:11:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter Thanks for the update. Is he waiting for the check from Mexico?
944416488827621376 2017-12-22 03:56:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter @kdwatson58 @RAMRANTS She is not even pretty on the tiny screen.
944416059771285506 2017-12-22 03:55:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter @RAMRANTS Are those real?
944415931203313664 2017-12-22 03:54:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter @RAMRANTS I never thought that I would agree with you. WOW. We should call them the antipopulist party.
944408717092642816 2017-12-22 03:25:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @DavidCornDC Let's start a new one. Today would be a good day for Donald Trump to resign. Then he can keep his stupid tax returns.
944407308406280192 2017-12-22 03:20:23 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @buffaloon @DavidCornDC I like your never die spirit. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
944406475086139394 2017-12-22 03:17:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @MaddowBlog It's as if he's trying to tear at our hearts. THE MAN IS PURE SCUM.
944404653747376128 2017-12-22 03:09:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Merry Christmas, Bill. Felice Novidad. May this be a blessed year for all.
944403307057025024 2017-12-22 03:04:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @BernardGoldberg Because of his tweeting we know him. The more we know him the more we hate him.  The economy is good today because of BHO. DT's effects on the economy are yet to come.
944390877451030528 2017-12-22 02:15:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @BuzzFeed They think they are the cool kids. So, so nerdy.
944389633303072768 2017-12-22 02:10:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly What happrned to the fiscally conservative GOP? ADDING $1.5 TRILLION of debt on top of $20. Int rates are going up the debt service will bury us. How will we pay for fixing our infrastructure. Way overdue. Trickle down doesn't work! Rich get richer.
944385572214333440 2017-12-22 01:54:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @BBCWorld I will say what I damn well please. If he wants to be a dictator let him go to hell. His days are numbeted.
944381636044558336 2017-12-22 01:38:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly This too shall end up in the Bin Ghazi Pile of failed G O P attempts at fabricating scandals. #waste
944358091361083392 2017-12-22 00:04:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The Individual Mandate is there for a reason. To keep premiums down. ACA is based on the concept if we  all participate, healthy and sick, we can have good ins @ affordable prices. If we all get healthy med costs will go down. 2much logic?
944278465498505217 2017-12-22 18:48:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @BernardGoldberg @olsen_douglas If the polls were in your  favor you'd like them better.
944252984883638272 2017-12-22 17:07:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg @CKgolfer2 @smithcron21 You really believe there is nothing to know. Putin interfered in our election according to your brethren in our intelligence agencies. They concluded for sure not maybe. Some have called this an act or war. If Clinton won youd agree. Sad.
944249605470019585 2017-12-22 16:53:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @tedcruz You keep trying to blurr the line between church and state. We a country for all the people and all religions. Religious freedom should be absolute not just when a baker refuses to make a cake for a gay couple.
944096108892119040 2017-12-21 06:43:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg You're probably right. It's just the liberal press.
944094726235607041 2017-12-21 06:38:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg Maybe it's because he gutted the State Dept. Maybe it's b/c he is making shit out of our Intelligence agencies. Maybe it's because he is giving away federal lands. Maybe it's b/c 19 women claim he molested them. I could keep going.......
944092852665159680 2017-12-21 06:30:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg Maybe it's because instead of draining the swamp he made it bigger and smellier. Maybe it's b/c he appointed misfits to the fed. courts.
944092069982883840 2017-12-21 06:27:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg Maybe we don't like him because he keeps poking the bear. He wants to start a war somewhere. If not Korea, maybe the Middle East or Iran. The only one he does not piss off is Putin. Tillerson is right. He is a moron.
944090454299234304 2017-12-21 06:21:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg Maybe we don't like him because he lies incessantly. #wearenotstupid
944089934771773440 2017-12-21 06:19:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg Maybe many Americans believe that the economy is doing so well b/c of Obama. Maybe DT doesn't care what people want; ACA, Paris accord, they're against tax bill, pollution controls, consumer protection.....
944086960280399877 2017-12-21 06:07:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @BernardGoldberg Maybe they believe that because the circumstantial evidence is overwhe!ming. There may not be a smoking gun yet but there is a lot of smoke. Firing Comey. Attacking Mueller. Kissing Putin' s ass. Totally ignoring Russia's meddling in our election....
943698421462028288 2017-12-20 04:23:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @CNN @BillOReilly You cant really bitching about the media. Trump has more media access with his tweets than any president. He also has FOX which fawns all over him like he was the best thing since sliced bread. Maybe Tillerson is right he is a moron.
943695624259690496 2017-12-20 04:12:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @CNN @BillOReilly @PKopcza @LloydWayneMadd1 @jenvitali CNN is the most trusted news org. in the world.
943694828860268544 2017-12-20 04:09:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @CNN @BillOReilly @PKopcza 2 things: 1-CNN is not the only one with that approval rating. 2- Even with that handicap he is still lower than most predidents at this time.
943689067035799552 2017-12-20 03:46:21 UTC <michaelkaf> To give a tax cut to the wealthy the G O P agreed to go into hock. To pay for poor kids health ins. No Way!
943640043071172610 2017-12-20 00:31:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @VP Are your lips chapped? Is your nose brown? Have you no integriy? Are you spineless? This is no way to bring the  approval ratings of your boss out of the cellar. #wearenotstupid
943613561158471680 2017-12-20 22:46:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If by that you mean that the rich will get richer and richer and richer. You are right.  However, that does not bode well for our economy.  #wearenotstupid
943407538250436609 2017-12-20 09:07:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The consequences will be dire. The wealth gap will widen. The economy will suffer.  All you care abt is a win for the GOP. Savor this one because 2018 will be a blood bath which you so richly deserve.
943156378511781891 2017-12-19 16:29:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump Wouldn't believe you if you swore on a stack of bibles. You have no soul. You are the evil fake pres.  #wearenotstupid
943011684737863683 2017-12-18 06:54:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Translation: I want you to think that is happening but it really isn't. Trump and I are really sleaze balls. #wearenotstupid
943009209033007104 2017-12-18 06:44:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly You wanted an investigations on Bin Ghazi. you Got 16. NOTHING You Wanted Investigations on Clinton emails. You got that too. NOTHING You wanted an investigation on IRS. NOTHING! AGAIN. STOP WASTING OUR TIME & MONEY.
942992711732342784 2017-12-18 05:39:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Mystery solved; economy is great yet your approval ratings are the worse ever?!?!  You are scum!
942988449702965248 2017-12-18 05:22:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @SenJohnMcCain Get well doon. We miss you. We miss your courage and integrity GOD BLESS YOU!
942589507223859201 2017-12-17 02:57:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly They are destroying our environment. Giving polluters a free pass. Rolling back consumer protection. The State Dept has been gutted. Appointing inexperienced federal judges. Not investigating Russian aggression.
942452857101570048 2017-12-17 17:54:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Yes you did. You also said the rich will not benefit. LIE.  You actually said the rich need to pay more. LIE. THIS IS  A MASSIVE TAX CUTS FOR CORPORATIONS. Corps who admitted they will not pass the savings along to employees. HAPPY HOLLIDAYS.
942283929016590336 2017-12-16 06:42:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @amjoyshow No one is above the law.
942282011636584448 2017-12-16 06:35:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You sure you don't want to trash them too? What's that? Maybe tomorrow.
942281063308693509 2017-12-16 06:31:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @carlreiner Your being too generous. He is a sick slimeball.  HEY DERE. PARDNER.
942098493421883393 2017-12-16 18:25:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter Gov't reduces taxes on corps and wealthy to keep those contributions coming. #wearenotstupid $rule
942097193179205632 2017-12-16 18:20:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter When Trump wins we lose. That message is beginning to resonate. I hope he keeps supporting lots of G O P candidates. Cant wait until 2018.
942096029293441027 2017-12-16 18:16:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter For once in your life you were in the majority.
942093996175880193 2017-12-16 18:08:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly I am so glad for you. HAPPY HOLLIDAYS!
942093596664238080 2017-12-16 18:06:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter We all know that s a lie. A lie to get a reaction. I gotta admit it was a good one. It's goes to prove 99% of what you say is 4 ratings.#wearenotstupid
942085762748690432 2017-12-16 17:35:23 UTC <michaelkaf> @AnnCoulter You are a strong willed woman. (mjr.understatement). If u wanted a husband & kids you'd have them. You wanted attention. U got it. 99% of what you say is  mean 2b sensationsl. U R laughing all the way 2 the bank.
942064876540846080 2017-12-16 16:12:23 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Here is a great topic for discussion. What ever happened to the G O P  motto "CHARACHTER MATTERS"?
942063968553721856 2017-12-16 16:08:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly She ATTEMPTED to make payments. Not a small distinction. Their stories were not rebuked. You and DT are dirt bags. There is a case in court claiming DT raped a 13 yr old. Are u going to discuss that?
942045846526361600 2017-12-16 14:56:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!"
941880040643551232 2017-12-15 03:57:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @RepAdamSchiff We as Dems need to do something; organize demonstrations, get some air time. Filibuster if you have to. Shut down the government. We must push back on DT who just adores Putin.
941743236779036679 2017-12-15 18:54:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly You also paid 32 mil to settle a case. Try spinning that. You also had proof.  We're still waiting. You are so full of crap. #wearenotstupid
941560408095248384 2017-12-14 06:47:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @RealMarkiss @tonyposnanski He used to one of the at far right wack jobs. Now he just to the left of crazy.
941559641070342144 2017-12-14 06:44:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @20committee Like in the Wild Wild West. IT'S A STAMPEDE!!!
941556891494354945 2017-12-14 06:33:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @modgirl26 Russians is also anti gay. Duterte of the Philippines kils his people w/o a trial by the thousands. Putin gets rid of dissenters like we take out the garbage. Our so called fake pres admires all of those.
941512956826783744 2017-12-14 03:39:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Lies lies lies
941497446215102465 2017-12-14 02:37:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @mikefarb1 Namecalling is beneath your dignity. Or is it? Since Obama treated the internet like a utility the internet has been great for consumers. We want to keep it that way.
941495721919950848 2017-12-14 02:30:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @thinkprogress DT feels that its his job to help them. He just forgets to say please, he just grabs them by the p***y.
941494202604687361 2017-12-14 02:24:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @sassygayrepub Trump has backed out of the Paris Accord. He is giving polluters a pass. He is giving federal lands to industry. He is destroying our country and our planet.
941492993168723969 2017-12-14 02:19:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You are stacking the deck in favor of big biz under the guise of  unbridled capitalism. #wearenotstupid
941489529520906240 2017-12-14 02:06:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump There good regs and there are bad regs. The ones that protect consumers and the environment are good. When you cut those your helping big biz. #wearenotstupid
941487682349387776 2017-12-14 01:58:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly We should fire DT and put Corgis in charge. I'm sure he tweets better too. HAPPY HOLLIDAYS
941486811913883648 2017-12-14 01:55:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @GOPChairwoman  You are OK with this tax bill being rammed through Soviet style behind close doors. No open hearings. In Russia everything is done by one party too. SHAMEFUL. Democracy dies from within!
941485802453860358 2017-12-14 01:51:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman I am accelerating my real estate tax payments which will be limited due to our Paycheck pres. I call him our fake pres.
941350938559827968 2017-12-14 16:55:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly When are you going to demand that he be investigated for his alleged sexual assaults? HA HA HA HA (the day after never?)
941349592855142400 2017-12-14 16:50:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Is there any correlation between the fact that DT refuses to resign for his alleged sexual assaults same as other law makers. R U going to discuss if he is above the law. Why does he lie incessantly?
941347861433933829 2017-12-14 16:43:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @NoSpinNews @BillOReilly Better chances are that we know that DT is attempting to attack our free press by claiming they are fake for reporting the ugly honest truth.
940962901367689216 2017-12-13 15:13:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump It proves that to you winning  is everything.it's the only thing. At all costs. Your tax law is just a means to winning. The people be damned.
940961425480089600 2017-12-13 15:07:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump It proves that we are On to you. Character matters, the truth matters. You just keep tweeting and lying and your going to lose your razor thin margins and you will be impeached. You are not above the law.

940783982249238531 2017-12-12 03:22:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Happy Holidays to you too!
940631985244065792 2017-12-12 17:18:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @HoneyDemForce @SenGillibrand You go girl! We're in the majority now. We can't let up until he is gone.
940625977784270849 2017-12-12 16:54:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If Moore will always vote with you doesnt that make him your pupprt? Draine the swamp. Let's start with you.
940623814437765121 2017-12-12 16:46:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Does anyone believe you anymore? Ivanka? We certainly don't. Why r u attacking Mueller. We believe the women. We believe u when u boast of being a p***y grabber.
940621631914954753 2017-12-12 16:37:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump This was years in the making. Due to Obama stimulus and low int rates. The whole world is experiencing economic growth. Obama did it when we had a worldwide recession. No One likes your tax bill
940416411050135553 2017-12-11 03:01:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @CruzWhobris @ReutersPolitics Why aren't the rest of the Dems with them?
940415358393036800 2017-12-11 02:57:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @KidsNotMarkets @nickiknowsnada Check the look on Miss Georgia's face?
940412778459926528 2017-12-11 02:47:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @BarackObama  You need to start a movement to make POTUS pay for his sexual abuses.  There is no one that can be above moral  reproach. If he is exempt our children we'll see us as hypocrits.
940409478276579328 2017-12-11 02:34:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @SenSchumer  Why aren't you organising your fellow Senators to investigate POTUS sexual abuse history. He is not above the law. What are u afraid of?
940406384931328000 2017-12-11 02:22:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @VP How come your boss lies and says stupid moronoic stuff and his staff has to spinn the s**t out of it. Aren't you tired of bending over and kidding bitt.
940372689558163456 2017-12-11 00:08:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump  You must do the honorable thing and resign. You are no better than anyone else! You are not above the law. #resign
940272020184600582 2017-12-11 17:28:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Seems like your defending yourself more by attacking the source than actually denying the fact that you watch 4-8 hrs. Implies to me that you are lying. For a change. I believe the prosperous ethical Times.
939970407238651905 2017-12-10 21:29:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump What needs more discussion are your impeachable offenses. No one is talking abt the emuluments clause.
939892589184143361 2017-12-10 16:20:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @RepAdamSchiff Collusion and treason come to mind.
939892180117872643 2017-12-10 16:18:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump  I know that you think that your s**t does not stink. I am hear to yell you that your steaming pile of dumg that is growing by the minute reaks to high heaven. #resign.
939886583632875522 2017-12-10 15:56:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @NicolleDWallace He is the last person that has a right to complain about lying. Thanks to him that bar has never been lower. He has shattered our moral compass.
939884065720799232 2017-12-10 15:46:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The economy is doing very well. Your approval numbers s/b much higher. #wearenotstupid
939714614194995200 2017-12-09 04:33:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @washingtonpost @daveweigel @realDonaldTrump Can we get apologies for all your lies. Are you really demanding for an apology. You don't even feel a little bit hypocritical? REALLY???
939712362218708992 2017-12-09 04:24:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @daveweigel @realDonaldTrump If we can fire you for all your lies.  You have made it OK to lie, cheat, molest women, to be a pedophile, ignore the constitution. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TALK, MR FAKE PRES.
939366048981233664 2017-12-08 05:28:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You're absolutely right. This our land. All of US, white, black, brown & yellow and every shade inbetween so                          HAPPY HOLIDAYS                            ONE AND ALL                      *******PEACE*******
939139349857357824 2017-12-08 14:27:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Word on the street is that FOX NEWS will change its name to TRUMP NEWS. Maybe than they will take you back. Just kidding. You're too big of a slime ball.
939138070552760320 2017-12-08 14:22:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Subtle. Again you attack the messenger. A favorite weapon of the right. Here is a hint for you. Don't talk down to us. #wernotstupid
939135335946170368 2017-12-08 14:11:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You have put us on the path to make global warming worse. You have stripped away consumer protection. You're increasing wealth disparity. You will increase the debt. You have enlarged the swamp x 10. U R taking away federal lands 4 comm'l use. The world is laughing @ you..
939022462112604160 2017-12-07 06:42:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl What good does it do to make that proclamation now. He has made a lot of Arabs angry. I thought he wanted to facilitate a peace process. Not happening!
939020857187303426 2017-12-07 06:36:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-approval-rating-hits-new-record-low-making-him-most-unpopular-741916
939016893918089217 2017-12-07 06:20:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @HoarseWisperer @DC4Hope Me too. That was a big loss.
939016326865076224 2017-12-07 06:18:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @SandraRoggero @HoarseWisperer I would vote for him for pres.
939014514728624128 2017-12-07 06:11:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The difference between you and your predecessors  is that they realized that to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital would do more harm than good so they delayed. You want to stir things up and keep some things off the headlines. We are not that stupid. What next?
939012581376663553 2017-12-07 06:03:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If it turns out that your campaign promise is stupid it does not mean you have to go through with it. If many advise against it than maybe you should've reconsidered. What have you accomploshed? U made a lot of Arabs angry. TV  ratings are good though, right. Yeah!
939010670388920320 2017-12-07 05:56:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If your campaign promise was to cause havoc and derail the peace process you sure did. Timing is everything. Yours sucks.
938963695224414209 2017-12-07 02:49:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @missmayim Hope you and your loved ones are OK. Happy Hannuka
938941674230878208 2017-12-07 01:21:54 UTC <michaelkaf> If the purpose of exposing & punishing men who assault women is to change our culture are we defeating that purpose by giving our president a pass.
938921193809342464 2017-12-07 00:00:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @RWPUSA Is our president exempt from these standsrds? HE TOO MUST PAY THE PRICE!
938919938559037440 2017-12-07 23:55:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You are not above acceptable morality and decency. 16 women accused you of sexual assault. You admitted that you are a p***y grabber. You condone pedophile behavior.  Do the right thing. RESIGN!!!
938847328600981504 2017-12-07 19:07:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly What is dissapoing is a president who has denigrated our intelligence services for simply doing their job just because he does  not agree with their findings. The truth will out!
938845926520745984 2017-12-07 19:01:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Think long and hard before you tweet. Are you pushing us closer to war? So far the answer is a resounding yes.
938799364759277570 2017-12-07 15:56:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @VP Unfortunately your admin is only bringing us closer to war. Calling pres Un short and fat is stupid. Donald is bent on starting a war. God help us.
938616245380935680 2017-12-06 03:48:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump America was great. And it will n great after you are gone. The sooner the better.
938615641287942145 2017-12-06 03:46:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump It seems to me that you have a desire  to start a war. You tried with N  K. Now you are stoking things up in Israel.
938601024314626048 2017-12-06 02:48:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @MPRnews A real loss. As a representative of progressive liberal ideals he won't be easy to replace. Let's hope his loss won't be in vein.
938530154892185600 2017-12-06 22:06:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly The lesson for politicians caught red handed is simple, deny, deny, deny! Worked for Trump. Seems to be working for Moore.
938469034336636928 2017-12-06 18:03:48 UTC <michaelkaf> The lesson we learn from Trump and Moore is that the old adage still applies. If your wife catches you in bed with another woman deny, deny, deny.
938405152851156992 2017-12-06 13:49:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @TomiLahren No ban, no wall, Happy Hollidays
938252838647554048 2017-12-05 03:44:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @AdrianRobert20 Send him a check.
938252108784177154 2017-12-05 03:41:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Wrong again.
938251716004376583 2017-12-05 03:40:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump I would go if I could sit in the  front row with a barrel full of rotton eggs and totton tomatoes.
938250780821336066 2017-12-05 03:36:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler You tell him, Bette. He is trying out for Scrouge. He fits the role like a globe. Just when you think you couldn't hate him anymore!
938249562665488384 2017-12-05 03:31:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You make Scrouge look like a saint. Our national  parks and monuments make us great. LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!!!!!
938248493117988865 2017-12-05 03:27:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Happy Holidays to you and yours
938061783557967872 2017-12-05 15:05:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You would support the devil to get your way. Your evil days are numbered. Mueller is coming for you.
938060978478108672 2017-12-05 15:02:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You don't need an excuse to support Moore. Birds of a feather.....
938060446053097472 2017-12-05 15:00:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump  LEAVE OUR PUBLIC LANDS ALONE!!!!!
938059884242849793 2017-12-05 14:57:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The rise in the stock market helps the wealthy
938058515117199360 2017-12-05 14:52:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly People like you, DT and Moore. And they favor the wealthy.
937801301991329793 2017-12-04 21:50:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly It's a case currently in court. No an old  story. I understand why you 2 stick up for each other. I dare u to read this on your show.
937799633249755136 2017-12-04 21:43:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Your going away on obstruction of justice and maybe more. All the tweets in the world will not change that. #lockhimup
937522872209346560 2017-12-03 03:24:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump He was replaced to maintain integrity in the investigation. That's a good thing. Makes  one believe in the institution. But you knew that. #LIAR
937520752437481472 2017-12-03 03:15:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump LIES, LIES, LIES. WE ARE NOT STUPID. We didn't believe you the first time. We may never believe you again.
937519510235512832 2017-12-03 03:10:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Does this mean that we can sue you for lying to us? I am glad that you are a billionaire. I'd like to see you go bankrupt one more time.
937517185504825344 2017-12-03 03:01:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @A_ThinkingGirl @SallyQYates His attitude is shameful. Disgraceful. Stupid. Its bettet to have the FBI on your side.
937511427828584448 2017-12-03 02:38:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @shannonrwatts That's been a constant problem of the Democrats. We are too nice.  We lack the killer instinct that the GOP uses so well. 16 Bin Ghazi investigations. 60 votes to rep. & repl. Clinton's emails never left the headlines. They are not afraid to lie. A lie oft repeated...
937477177171415041 2017-12-03 00:22:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Why should he expect a media attack? Just because he will have signed a law that is unpopular,  a law that was rammed on the voters with no public hearings. No compromise. A law that will add $1.5 tri. to the debt. A law that favors Corps and  rich...
937182104160559104 2017-12-02 04:50:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @tutticontenti I am ashamed to be part of the human race.
937180402405511168 2017-12-02 04:43:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @NancyWonderful @robreiner That big fat "dot" should spend a long stretch at Rykers.
937179447660306432 2017-12-02 04:39:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @ABC @realDonaldTrump Now we need to fire our fake pres. Who lies all the time. Who obstructed justice. Who at a minimum knew about the Russian collusion. #wearenotstupid
936398089191088128 2017-11-30 00:54:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Why is it that no other president has announced every minute accomplishment. Are you insecure with what you have achieved. You should be.
936397027356938240 2017-11-30 00:50:23 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump I figured out the secret to your success. We know it's not ability. It's not deal making. It's not governing. It's not uniting  our country. Certainly not your brilliance. YOU ARE ONE LUCKY F*****G MORON.
936395032915005441 2017-11-30 00:42:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Happy Holidays to you & yours
935569336705732609 2017-11-28 18:01:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @BillOReilly We know that the spokespeople for the native Americans thghout his remarks did not belong during this special occasion. For shame.
935522952946348033 2017-11-28 14:57:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Lies, lies, lies. We are not stupid. You were once for DACA too. They are decent and humane and you are evil. How about some public hearings? Are we no longer a Democracy?  The only one raising  taxes is you. The only one raisong the debt is you
935383001965490176 2017-11-27 05:41:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The bad news for you is that your lies and lack of ethics makes them look like amateurs. #lockhimup Mueller is getting closer!!!
935344388435333120 2017-11-27 03:07:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You lie, lie, lie. Democrats dont want a tax increase. On the other hand the GOP wants a tax break for their buddies the rich which will end with a tax hike for many of us the deplorables.
935342285100933120 2017-11-27 02:59:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You realize this will cost $1.5 tril. If it ain't broke don't fix it!  I wish we could send you the bill. I bet if you had to pay for it you'd scrub it.
935339012520316928 2017-11-27 02:46:13 UTC <michaelkaf> Are you trying to see how low your approval ratings will go. You are a MORON. We are not that stupid.
935306634582282241 2017-11-27 00:37:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler He had to clarify who he meant. He knows it's not obviously clear. Especially since his approval ratings are in the toilette. Where he belongs.
935193359899070464 2017-11-27 17:07:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Glad you clarified who you meant is our favorite pres. Most people would not have guessed that. But you  know that.
935191050133614593 2017-11-27 16:58:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If you change the contest to the biggest liar and add your name you will win hands down.
934998834450784256 2017-11-26 04:14:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Lock him up! Lock him up! LOCK HIM UP!
934998132701782017 2017-11-26 04:11:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Why do the economists say this bill will not promote growth just debt?
934964361441038337 2017-11-26 01:57:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly We are  going into debt for $1.5 tril. just so the GOP can claim a victory. Sounds like rip off to me. The corps dont need the break. Make sure they pay tax on all sales in the USA. Close that loophole.
934923998370164736 2017-11-26 23:17:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If I read between the lines, we should ignore what the Russians & you did  to us because the market is up.  We too will protest being molested. NO WAY! NO HOW! U WILL PAY. LOCK HIM UP!!!!
934831882117795840 2017-11-26 17:11:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Can't blame you for not mentioning Moore's name. I gag at the mention of his name. You too?
934819011732344832 2017-11-26 16:19:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The scum endorsing the perv. You have no decency, no shame. I hope this endorsement ends the same  as your last
934656371156496384 2017-11-25 05:33:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who is the fairest of them all? If you don't tell me FOX will.
934655767461982208 2017-11-25 05:31:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump My motto. " I don't waste a tragedy." #wearenotstupid
934655126144471040 2017-11-25 05:28:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Lies lies lies. We are not stupid!!!!!
934654104953147392 2017-11-25 05:24:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @CFPB @WSJ @realDonaldTrump You mean the  paper owned by the Murdochs. Their editorials are not worth the paper they are printed on. CFPB IS A great consumer watchdog.
934652142874394625 2017-11-25 05:16:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump CNN would survive in the world if they were not real truthfull news. People rely on them for the truth and they deliver. You my dear fake pres. can't handle the  truth. FOX  is fake dishonest news which is why they are not accepted beyond our borders.
933870852009062400 2017-11-23 01:32:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @RWPUSA I hope you are right.
933851641790566400 2017-11-23 00:15:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Record number of people signing up. Because they LIKE it. LIAR LIAR LIAR. Premiums going up because of uncertainty u caused. You are truly evil.
933808215132987392 2017-11-23 21:23:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @chrislhayes Very nice family. HAPPY THANKSGIVING!
933807501258174470 2017-11-23 21:20:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @missmayim You look great. Happy THANKSGIVING to you and yours.
933806455542730752 2017-11-23 21:16:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler Love you Bette. HAPPY THANKS GIVING!
933748939689484289 2017-11-23 17:27:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly YECH right back at you. Everyday he says and/or does something to ruin our day. The latest being a pedofile supporter/endorser. So we're sorry to ruin his golf game down in Mar A Lego. We are truly sorry that he is not resigning. HAPPY THANKS GIVING. America was greater w/o him.
933733776244568064 2017-11-23 16:27:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @ThePlumLineGS @realDonaldTrump We have given up on expecting you to act presidential. We'll lower the bar. How about just trying to be a grown up?
933732333408092160 2017-11-23 16:21:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @ThePlumLineGS @realDonaldTrump @FiIibuster @NativeTexan74 Our neighbors are looking for new trading partners. Our environment is at peril. Eradicating consumer protections. Internal division worse than ever. Getting closer to  war. We r the laughing stock of the world for having a f****g moron as pres. WAKE UP!

933357254769893376 2017-11-22 15:31:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @shannonrwatts @EricaGrieder To equate Franken with Moore is like equating a petty thief and a bank robber. Franken showed remorse & cared. Moore denies any guilt. He cares only for himself.

931955870359048193 2017-11-18 18:42:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @VP Tax cuts to corporations are huge and permanent. Tax cuts to middle class are puny and temp. Shame on you.
931955424311562240 2017-11-18 18:41:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @VP Are we going in to debt of 1.5 trillion just so GOP can show that they can pass a bill? Politics at its worse. We are not stupid. Cant wait till election day.
931954449039396865 2017-11-18 18:37:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump What is not good for GOP: Your approval ratings at 38%. If you gave a s**t about the GOP or U S you'd resign.

927932796752093184 2017-11-07 16:16:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You don't care abt tomorrow. #stupid. Tomorrow will come and stock will go down. U will own that. Hopefully it will come during elections
927724451768258560 2017-11-06 02:28:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @funder I dare not get excited yet. Sounds too good to be true.
927723087755431936 2017-11-06 02:23:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Nothing compares to the trashing our fake pres gives his foes. Yet you get so upset when dems are upset at D B 4 her bad timing.
927702781162647552 2017-11-06 01:02:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler It's a problem that's only going  to snowball.  More guns, more massacres,  more people  will claim they need guns 4 protection....  .
927602251669082112 2017-11-06 18:23:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Is it a coincidence that the killer bought a gun in TX, a state that is very pro gun ownership. Maybe lax on gun laws.
927600963287945217 2017-11-06 18:17:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly WHY is it easier to buy a gun than drive a car? Both are considered to be legal weapons.
927599514512486400 2017-11-06 18:12:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly By that logic we should be going door to door selling guns at favorable financing rated. No  questions asked.

926994636031365120 2017-11-04 02:08:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Better Q:Who betrayed our country by colluding with Russians? 1- Flynt. 2-Jared. 3-Trump. 4.Sessions. 5.-Carter Page. 6-all of the above.
926989070278021120 2017-11-04 01:46:31 UTC <michaelkaf> Why isn't anyone questioning the wisdom of spending a tril. and half for a tax cut when the econ is going strong and we 20+ tril. of debt.

926855423419994112 2017-11-04 16:55:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Should we be targeting low labor participation rates? Gross wealth disparity? Corporations are doing just fine.
926854153518886912 2017-11-04 16:50:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If the econ is doing great why increase deficit to create more jobs. We r @full employment. INFLATION? ONEROUS DEBT SERVICE? think ahead!

926839242839547906 2017-11-04 15:51:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Participation rates are still going down. Not helping your voter base. Trading volume is down. Stock market not on sound footing.
926675230138908672 2017-11-03 04:59:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump As to the stock market, volume has been meager. People are not trusting that it will last. Can't blame em. U will fuck it up.
926674195324522496 2017-11-03 04:55:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Don't mean to burst your bubble but labor participation still sucks. That b ur out of work voters. They won't wait 4 ever.
926673278701326336 2017-11-03 04:51:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You created "jobs jobs jobs" after 8 yrs of stimulus & lo int  rates. BHO did it after Gr Recession. You should send him a nice present

925862920151535616 2017-11-01 23:11:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump There is no proof of that. Being against political correctness is appealing to your meager base. We are not that stupid.

923312884423196672 2017-10-25 22:18:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen "Trump U" lawsuit. He paid $25 to keep his illegal activities from the headlines.
923309939615027200 2017-10-25 22:06:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly You paid $32 mil for false accusations. Really??? We are not that stupid!
923309123118264320 2017-10-25 22:03:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly You are maligned. It is all fake news. You have proof. We are still waiting! Not holding my breath.
923307651882274817 2017-10-25 21:57:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Trump people tried to  buy dirt from our #2 enemy.  Bet u dont talk about that!
923298305429213184 2017-10-25 21:20:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen First we need to know why the pres. supports Russia no matter what. There is a lot of smoke. They will find the fire.
923296736403013632 2017-10-25 21:14:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen That is wishful thinking on your part. Would you bet a lot of money that Donny would finish his term?
923234506835980288 2017-10-25 17:07:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The damage you are doing is going to show up layer. The environment will  drain our resources. Dereg. will cause crashes. Learn from past
923210869651263488 2017-10-25 15:33:18 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Attacking Flake doesn't change the truth of his accusation. Everyone knows it. Senators kissing ur butt proves their cowrdice.
923209364995002369 2017-10-25 15:27:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Trump admitted on TV that he FIRED Comey b/c of Russian investigation. That is cause for WIRETAPPING. #impeach #lockhimup
923207977305337856 2017-10-25 15:21:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen You can not alter the truth or the message by  attacking the messenger. We are not that stupid.
923207004033814529 2017-10-25 15:17:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Lies, lies. Trump unwilling  to sanction Russia. Unwilling to say anything negative about our #1 enemy. Says it all. #TRAITOR
923156568253911040 2017-10-25 11:57:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump When Jr. Did it with Russians you said that was ok. #hypocracy.
923155882183143424 2017-10-25 11:54:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump They tell the truth.  They speak what others are afraid to say. The list of rinos is growing. Why?
923048976043126785 2017-10-24 04:49:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @QueerjohnPA @JoyAnnReid Didn't Trump defend Jr. @ Russian meeting - it's OK everybody does it.
923047785032749056 2017-10-24 04:45:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler His voice quivered. It was very poerful.
923027770275483650 2017-10-24 03:25:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Lies. Read the story. Perfectly legal.
923027340283740160 2017-10-24 03:24:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @WiredSources Lies, again. I just read the story. Investigation into DJT started by GOP during primaries than continued by DNC  & Hilary. NOT IMPROPER.
923008314463608832 2017-10-24 02:08:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @Lawrence @QueerjohnPA Me too.
922971774156976128 2017-10-24 23:43:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Eventually all those that support Trump will drown in his degredation. The few brave ones like Flake who defy will Rise As Winners.
922967098313277440 2017-10-24 23:24:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Mueller will  really finish it..

922963301792919554 2017-10-24 23:09:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @byrdinator What does it say that a meeting is considered "very positive" if no foul language was uttered. #howlowcanhego
922960493547048960 2017-10-24 22:58:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump They hate you for destroying their party. You don't only lie to us you lie to yourself.

922958532055633921 2017-10-24 22:50:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump There are GOP Senators who are not afraid of you and tell the trurh. Yes, the truth. A stranger to you.
922957019459571712 2017-10-24 22:44:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump So nice to hear from courageous GOP senators tell the truth.
922947856239136769 2017-10-24 22:08:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @RNRKentucky They fought for our freedoms. Freedom to protest. Not for a piece of cloth or some song. The pilgrims came to escape suppression of protest.
922945023024553984 2017-10-24 21:56:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @JeffFlake @SteveBannen Here is something to think about. What if this is just the begining. McCain, Flake, Wilson, Michael Steele, Graham, McConell...
922942482974945280 2017-10-24 21:46:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @JeffFlake @SteveBannen Here is a scary Halloween thought. What if this only the begining. 
922937217877671936 2017-10-24 21:25:54 UTC <michaelkaf> Our fake president can take any situation and make it worse: Condolence to fallen soldier. Obamacare. NAFTA. TPP. IRAN TREATY.
922932248416079872 2017-10-24 21:06:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @JeffFlake save your dignity and soul run as a Democrat. What have you got to lose.
922930360203259904 2017-10-24 20:58:39 UTC <michaelkaf> Mrs Sanders said of Senators Flake speech that it was inappropriate for the Senate floor.She speaks for our fake pres who LIES and LIES....
922923795471482880 2017-10-24 20:32:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @WWilcox55  I am honored to be included on your never Trump list. Don't forget #notmypres. To Trump lying is as natural as breathing.
922891697582882816 2017-10-24 18:25:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Can you spell "collusion"?
922891151648219137 2017-10-24 18:22:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Just for the record freedom of speech (protest) is guaranteed in our const. Look it up.
922890530668806144 2017-10-24 18:20:23 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen You are neck & neck in the race for for most lies. So far Donny is ahead by a nose just ahead of Pinocchio

922860027739766784 2017-10-24 16:19:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Your destructive policy toward our environment will  cost us many billions and challenge our security. #sciencedenier
922859117798215682 2017-10-24 16:15:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Your anti consumer and pro wealthy policy will slow our  economy down.

922857726602080263 2017-10-24 16:10:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We are riding the crest of a worldwide economic expansion. 8 years of Obama stimulus and low int. rates. Not of your doing.
922855708290437120 2017-10-24 16:02:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Stock market is like roller coaster. When it goes down who will you blame?
922829073944064002 2017-10-24 14:16:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Iran deal achieved objective. Iran is abiding by terms of treaty. Tax cuts for wealthy who don't want tax break. Trickle down doesn't work.
922223972372054018 2017-10-22 22:11:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Kelley lied. Did not apologize or retract. He is now officially part of the swamp. How low will they go!

917927248358985728 2017-10-10 01:38:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @jlw_jamie Our country was formed because out forfathets did not have the right of free expression. Thsy is our most precious God given righy.
917908649720328192 2017-10-10 00:24:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen We won't be happy in until Donny is impeached or dare we say behind bars. Maybe you could  keep him company.
917907993798340610 2017-10-10 00:21:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Our fake president has still not denounced the sex predators at FOX
917906575368613888 2017-10-10 00:15:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Donny is getting  away with it just fine. P***y grabbing must b exempt.
917905560720367616 2017-10-10 00:11:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Talk is cheap
917868769262915585 2017-10-10 21:45:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Now you know how we feel. We have a fool for a fake pres.
917807274898395138 2017-10-10 17:41:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Stop this fake B S. We are not that stupid. It's all a bunch of hot air. Congress will no change N F L tax status and you know it
917806222702792704 2017-10-10 17:37:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You lied, for a change, when you promised to keep DACA deal. We and the whole world will no longer believe you.
917805205063983105 2017-10-10 17:33:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Not everything is about ratings. Maybe in TV blz. Get your head into being a pres. If gov't isn't working it's on you.
917803899863621632 2017-10-10 17:27:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @IsraelUSAforevr What about moving embassy? Settlements? Your no dif than Obama
917803398275182598 2017-10-10 17:25:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump All I see you doing is trashing ACA causing premiums to rise and choices to dwindle
917613021891121152 2017-10-09 04:49:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Too bad Donny is not in the pic than you would have 3 of a kind.
917612044488192000 2017-10-09 04:45:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @PowerT98 Anyone fits that bill of being wiser and more experienced that our fake and juvenile president.
917527655662194690 2017-10-09 23:10:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Where are all the FOX  icons and all the silent G O P voices.
917525723971293185 2017-10-09 23:02:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Or maybe he is a wise Senator who is more knowledgeable and experienced than our infantile pres.
917523181270913024 2017-10-09 22:52:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Too bad we  have  a worthless fake pres. who blames  everyone but himself.
917522598044499968 2017-10-09 22:50:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @VP @realDonaldTrump It's a shame you waste money to thwart free speech. The individual is more important than the State. We r not Russia.
917521505629679617 2017-10-09 22:45:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If you say so. It's one man's opinion.  One lying fake pres. You have totally lost your cred.
917464138875654145 2017-10-09 18:57:51 UTC <michaelkaf> Let's boycott Vegas. This may put pressure on lawmakers to do something about gun control.
917463594882797568 2017-10-09 18:55:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Don't b quick to the trigger. Millions of lives  are at stake.
917138337600884737 2017-10-08 21:23:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You mean the Iran deal that all our allies won't abandon
917137125325398016 2017-10-08 21:18:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @SecondLady @VP @realDonaldTrump This is all a side show for your ever shrinking base. Just because we r not talking about Russia it doesn't mean Mueller isn't coming 4 you!
917136128460967936 2017-10-08 21:14:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The herd of rinos is growing. They will trample you.
917135192766210050 2017-10-08 21:10:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Why do so many respected leaders of G O P disagree with our fake pres. Rhetorical Q.
917027256001810432 2017-10-08 14:01:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Las Vegas may b strong but you  r weak. Grow a pair & stand up to N   R A. Abolish assault weapons. Universal background checks.
916885022359121920 2017-10-07 04:36:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Keep him surrounded and under constant obesrvation. Wait for him to make the 1st move. He is full of hot air just like you!
916883938399973376 2017-10-07 04:32:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump What would happen if we ignore him?
916802247379574784 2017-10-07 23:07:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You never give up on negotiations when it comes to nuclear war
916730718197288961 2017-10-07 18:23:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @BetteMidler 2 in each packet?
916663798328647681 2017-10-07 13:57:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @washingtonpost This time we have seen him in action. IT AIN'T PRETTY.
916662859140132864 2017-10-07 13:53:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @washingtonpost I am betting on his impeachment. The PP report is real. Thank you Mr Steele.
916660682942230528 2017-10-07 13:45:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness What has Donny done to cause this? During Obama's admin when the DOW went you were saying that this only helps the wealthy.
916659721167360000 2017-10-07 13:41:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump They report how a fake pres messes everything up. YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH. Turn on FOX.
916658445893427200 2017-10-07 13:36:18 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump So you can tell us how this is the quiet before the storm. WHAT STORM? Listen to the smart ones and shut up.
916656087608250369 2017-10-07 13:26:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You have the media listening and broadcasting every sound you make. And your tweets reach millions. What more do you want?
916512903796350976 2017-10-06 03:57:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen How much $ are you willing to bet on that?
916389781390741505 2017-10-06 19:48:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @axios I hope she getting paid well.
915970130064048128 2017-10-05 16:01:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Name calling and debasing will not derail Russian investigation. "Me think though doth protest too much."
915967670276718599 2017-10-05 15:51:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Or maybe after 8 years they could not come up with anything better
915966858628669440 2017-10-05 15:48:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Except when it comes to a will & desire to prevent future massacres. Ban assault weapons. Universal background checks. FUCK NRA!

915565385713426438 2017-10-04 13:12:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @GovMattBevin YOU CAN'T LEGISLATE http://CRAZY.TRUE.YOU CAN ELIMINATE ASSAULT WEAPONS .You can mandate universal background CHECKS.

915345512886398977 2017-10-03 22:39:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Making assault weapons illegal is under our  control. Universal mandatory back ground checks are under our control

915030514091937792 2017-10-02 01:47:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen What are you trying to prove?
914998050027950081 2017-10-02 23:38:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @DeelightRI @robreiner They are gutless cowards. There is need for people to own assault weapons. Universal background checks is a must !!!!!
914994273518522370 2017-10-02 23:23:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly When freedoms butt against public safety then compromises have to be made. Freedom is full of compromises.
914984302949146625 2017-10-02 22:43:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly How can you be so nonchalant about a mass killing that could have been avoided. Life is more precious than the 2nd.
914982093339361280 2017-10-02 22:35:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly We are are not free when the NRA holds our congressmen hostage.
914981195552841728 2017-10-02 22:31:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly What is on display is our unwillingness to recognize that there is no need for assault weapons. We will b safe & free w/o them.
914980212798033920 2017-10-02 22:27:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillOReilly Best time to bring up NRA absolute stranglehold on the spineless right. No right granted in the constitution is absolute
914978212819734529 2017-10-02 22:19:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Kasich  is too good for GOP. The man is a decent human being.
914962119568822273 2017-10-02 21:15:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Look in the mirror. You have a voice that can speak out. There is no need for assault rifles. Limit the size of clip. Are u afraid of NRA?
914332904691519489 2017-09-30 03:35:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We are the country that allows individuals to protest. That is what MAKES IS GREAT. You want us to go back to ordinary.
914293933966004224 2017-09-30 01:00:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You are our lying fake pres bitching about the media telling the truth. So you  call them fake

913872581840834561 2017-09-29 21:06:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen That is one idiots opinion

913641569751830528 2017-09-28 05:48:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @BillKristol @gfeinholtz @realDonaldTrump There is the rub. Donald does not know his business. At best he fakes it. At worse, God help us!
913637211748302849 2017-09-28 05:31:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @chrislhayes We can't win. We as desperate voters are hungry for a real change. That's how we elected the 1st black man and the 1st p***sy   grabber!

913634679126990848 2017-09-28 05:20:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen The tip of the iceberg. We've had a peek. This one has the potential to sink this admin.

912460965840658432 2017-09-25 23:37:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump #FreedomTrumpsRespect
912454462551109632 2017-09-25 23:11:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You realize that your voice no longer has cred. So you seek the support of General Kelley. He is under your command. We are not that stupid.
912453176481255424 2017-09-25 23:06:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump For a change you lie. The tremendous backlash is against our fake pres. Who denies the right to protest. #shame
912451911684673538 2017-09-25 23:01:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @jayMAGA45 You are claiming the support of a dead man. So sad. Maybe he supports freedom to protest. More likely. I dare you to RT
912148205055496192 2017-09-24 02:54:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @stephenkbannon what are you hiding? What are you afraid of? Are you hiding under a sheet?
912146118078853121 2017-09-24 02:45:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen What about sticking up for free speech? That falls under the responsibility of a real pres. All we have is a fake pres.
912128215698886656 2017-09-24 01:34:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Again you have your head in the sand. NFL fans support free speech. They don't support your anti  constitutional attitude.
912126620852457472 2017-09-24 01:28:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen The "love it or leave it" choice did not work during the Viet Nam  War. We were on the right side history back then and so we will prevail
912105838000721920 2017-09-24 00:05:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Do it right! Bipartisan consensus. Whay is  that definition of insanity?  65 times is enough!
912104293079101445 2017-09-24 23:59:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump No outside terrorists have attacked the US. NONE FROM THE COUNTRIES YOU BANNED.
912101157044187138 2017-09-24 23:47:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Freedom of protest for all is what our flag is all about. You do not get to chose.
912100476220575744 2017-09-24 23:44:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Fake president should support freedom of protest. We are not Russia. Putin is not our leader.
912098506059509760 2017-09-24 23:36:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen I got s special message for you. He will not survive the first term. #impeach
912097874527350784 2017-09-24 23:34:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen How about attacking football fans? Latinos?  Republicans leaders?

912065459180195840 2017-09-24 21:25:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @DonnaWR8 Freedom is what he fought for. Freedom for nonviolent protest. Freedom from fake presidents who are ignorant.
912061978797109248 2017-09-24 21:11:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump They are locked in solidarity against your disregard for our constitution. #resign.

912059034848636929 2017-09-24 20:59:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump It's not the flag stupid. It's FREEDOM. It's what the flag stands for. A draft dodger like you would not know that.
911819186208374784 2017-09-23 05:06:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If the Nazis have the right to protest so do black athletes. Too much logic???
911818549924155392 2017-09-23 05:04:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @VP Let's go to war. We'll figure it out as we go.
911818180817047552 2017-09-23 05:02:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @UN @POTUS @VP It requires keeping a fake president from tweeting. Earn your keep!

911815119520305153 2017-09-23 04:50:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Why is that some of your most vocal critics are Republicans? So many. So Sad.
911813919085383680 2017-09-23 04:45:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @FLOTUS @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It's going to take a lot more than a decent good looking Prince to sweep away the trashiness.
911812209692610561 2017-09-23 04:39:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen You are worthless as  a wingman. I am starting to see why you were fired.

911806512254795777 2017-09-23 04:16:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We don't know what kind of increase we would see under Trumpare. We don't need to know that. RIGHT? You putz!

911723127381651456 2017-09-23 22:45:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Do you ever get tired of shoveling it.
911712250083332096 2017-09-23 22:01:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The agreement is fine. Our fake president needs fixing. He is like a bull in a China Shop.
911711814127427584 2017-09-23 22:00:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump #wearenotthatstupid. You nailed it.

911704690181668866 2017-09-23 21:31:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Aren't you tired of shoveling the BS? Just remember that we, the non-deplorable, are not that stupid.
911701559024680961 2017-09-23 21:19:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump What about the country? Remember us? Well remember that next election.
911700914448236544 2017-09-23 21:16:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump And yet you can't come up with anything better. It's on you boss. B careful or you too will b FIRED!
911699767528448000 2017-09-23 21:12:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump They considered their freedom to protest more important than seeing your orange face.
911699107026231306 2017-09-23 21:09:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You can't b that ignorant. You're just yanking our chain. Ask one of your overpaid attorneys. US=freedom of dissent. We r not in Russia yet.
911696480863387651 2017-09-23 20:59:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Freedom of speech (protest) is in the constitution. But you know that.
911573311838179329 2017-09-23 12:49:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump People want Obamacare guarantees. Preexisting conditions not maybe for sure out. Remember the voters?
911432682357346304 2017-09-22 03:30:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump So evey one is in on this "hoax"? How stupid do u think we are?
911430876503953409 2017-09-22 03:23:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @TwitterData That does not mean squat. Hitler was very popular too.
911429308467511302 2017-09-22 03:17:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If you take a turd and wrap it up nice with a pink bow it still stinks! When will you learn?!?!
911427899198251008 2017-09-22 03:11:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump How dare u jam this down our throat. One sided, behind closed doors. No score. We are not that stupid!!!! You will continue to fail.
911426315932270592 2017-09-22 03:05:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump WHAT about all the lying promises you made. Millions of $ of free media time you got.
911425386323554305 2017-09-22 03:02:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump How stupid do you think we are? The only fake thing we see is you our lying fake pres. Now we know how HRC lost the election.
911423524950171651 2017-09-22 02:54:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump I guess you finally learned how to use that monitor. You lying hypocrite.
911421558920552448 2017-09-22 02:46:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump It takes one to know one.

910490922219196417 2017-09-20 13:08:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump They spoke "truth to power".
910490377613963265 2017-09-20 13:06:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @Scavino45 Iran deal achieved objective. Iran has no Nukes.
910489812943110144 2017-09-20 13:04:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump So far you have gotten nowhere with Rocket Man so yeah we can criticize.
910488808734457856 2017-09-20 13:00:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You don't care that preexisting conditions will be back. All you want is to pass something. SHAME ON YOU!
910487793973022720 2017-09-20 12:56:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You also promised to replace it with something better!!!
910487318443839489 2017-09-20 12:54:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump But we like Ocare. Better than anything you have come up with so far. If we don't manage h'care prices will soar. You  don't care!
910352985083072512 2017-09-19 04:00:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Or maybe they did not agree with most of it. Why not attack Russia? What do they have on you?
910201202532605958 2017-09-19 17:57:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @VP @netanyahu Courageous, outrageous not such a big dif. From one crook to another.
910195104484413440 2017-09-19 17:33:18 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @auntietoe A new take on the old anti peace movement slogan of the 70's - "Love it or leave it". We did not leave than and we won't leave now.
910188066052198402 2017-09-19 17:05:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump That is very, very, vague like all your mercurial presidency.
910186689322156032 2017-09-19 16:59:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen WHAT WIRETAPPING??? An oft repeated lie is still a lie.
909935128989888512 2017-09-18 00:20:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen This guy has more intellect, integrity, honesty and character in one finger than you will ever have.
909681536739549184 2017-09-18 07:32:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen That one is kind of stupid and not really funny. You need new material.
908168473586663424 2017-09-13 03:20:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump So your going to have huge expenses and we already have a big debt great time to cut revenue.Brilliant!
908166944330846208 2017-09-13 03:14:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump As the biggest deplorable you probably know she got 3 mil more votes.
908078427097493505 2017-09-13 21:22:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Hot sauce??? Matter of taste. The promise of safe streets was just a lot of hot air. Lies, lies and empty promises
908017068464918529 2017-09-13 17:18:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Agentbartlett When u shop at K Mart, Wall Mart and pay low prices for goods made in China,Bengaledesh ur supporting slave labor. Capitalism at its best.
908012571508305921 2017-09-13 17:00:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Make sure you r not doing the bidding of the rich. Estate Taxes, AMT elimination only helps them. Job creators=middle class.
908010329891901440 2017-09-13 16:51:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 The point is they r coming in that way too. Another wall? $45 bol. We need a comp plan.
908009036448137219 2017-09-13 16:46:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Agentbartlett We all use these "slaves". Reps & Dems. Don't act so hi&mighty. They are a positive force on our econ. Unlike slaves they want in not out
907938511529136128 2017-09-13 12:06:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon I see him as a man who saved us from losing 750K jobs a month to consecutive record of job creations. Ended 2 disastrous wars.
907937578011250688 2017-09-13 12:02:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Right wing garbage!
907934616258060289 2017-09-13 11:50:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon He used drones effectively and kept our troops out of harms way. He did bring us peace. He stopped our soldiers from dying in useless wars.
907932691999477761 2017-09-13 11:43:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon No. But don't say stupid shit. Trumps specialty. Look at your options and act. Talking stupid is stupid!
907932022626291712 2017-09-13 11:40:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon What was he supposed to do? He imposed sanctions. Obama was cool headed. He kept us out of stupid wars.
907931123866640386 2017-09-13 11:37:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon This does not change  the fact that you don't poke a crazy man who can lob a nuke at us. You can't get anymore crazy than that.
907929911033319425 2017-09-13 11:32:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon You don't poke a crazy bear. Kim Jung Un killed members of his own family. Everyone knows he is insane.
907929269229277186 2017-09-13 11:29:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon He was in charge. Made all the decisions.
907927615771742208 2017-09-13 11:23:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Ok. I Just can't believe u r supporting a man that almost got us into a nuclear war with N K. That dude b crazy.
907926541656576000 2017-09-13 11:18:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Romney congratulated him On killing Bin Laden. Stay focused will you.
907926123144781824 2017-09-13 11:17:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon http://pleasecutthecrap.com/obama-accomplishments/
907925542183284737 2017-09-13 11:14:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon The honorable Romney who ran against Obama.
907924621281910784 2017-09-13 11:11:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon You dont mind if I take the words of the historians.
907924132095983616 2017-09-13 11:09:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon That's BS. Even Romney conceded to that.
907923624878858240 2017-09-13 11:07:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Are you an insomniacs too?
907923249065070592 2017-09-13 11:05:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon I thought we were taking about Obama. Historians have ranked him as the 12th best president ever. Not bad, since the first 10 never change.
907921698514710529 2017-09-13 10:59:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Those are facts!!!
907920999919779840 2017-09-13 10:56:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Same goes for GW. who finally got him?
907920618615705600 2017-09-13 10:55:18 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Yes Bill blew it On that one. To be fair he is the only pres who balanced the budget. Does not change the fact that BHO saved us from that.
907919434668486656 2017-09-13 10:50:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon It's not how many. It's unbiased. The Heritage fdn is a conservative as you can get. Read my article whose sole objective is FACT checking.
907918810312839168 2017-09-13 10:48:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon You r blinded by right wing hype. He saved us from the great recession and brought us out of 2 useless self destructive wars.
907917925381758976 2017-09-13 10:44:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon He did not. That Is a right wing lie. Read my FACT check article. Let some truth in.http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/does-obamas-plan-gut-welfare-reform/
907917311893491712 2017-09-13 10:42:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon It's the humane thing to do. You help them to get back On their feet. This has been done for decades.
907916466347016192 2017-09-13 10:38:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Your sources are all biased. I quoted a fact check. Obama in reply to a state inquiry whether training 4 a job was like work he said yes.
907914447632650241 2017-09-13 10:30:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Yes I am.
907913745401294849 2017-09-13 10:27:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/does-obamas-plan-gut-welfare-reform/
907911957734465536 2017-09-13 10:20:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon The reason welfare went up during Obama's admin. is the recession. And yes 47 mil. Is a drop in the bucket. Look at the expense pie chart.
907911113085513728 2017-09-13 10:17:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Obama never repealed welfare reform.
907910369968091136 2017-09-13 10:14:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon No, those are facts based his actions.
907909101971283968 2017-09-13 10:09:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon I assumed you meant assistance as in the form welfare and food stamps. That is what you on the right always bitch about.
907907307295690753 2017-09-13 10:02:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon I am just saying Trump is no conservative.
907906468451667969 2017-09-13 09:59:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon ...and no matter what he says he is for the rich.
907905871107239939 2017-09-13 09:56:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @Arn55998898 @MarkRocon Trump is unstable, liar, unethical, science denier, anti environment, anti consumer protection... So no,I hate him passionately.
907802998625017857 2017-09-12 03:07:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @NoahShachtman @MaddowBlog @facebook @NicolleDWallace Truth is stranger than fiction and scarier too!
907802460949024768 2017-09-12 03:05:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @NicolleDWallace  Love you on the tube. Does anyone say that anymore?
907801689486479361 2017-09-12 03:02:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 If it were only that simple. GW tried it. Got us into a deep shitwhole.
907800295715082241 2017-09-12 02:57:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 Gov't assistance is a punie part of the budget.
907799500420517888 2017-09-12 02:54:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen With every tweet I see you more & more as an egocentric moron. I am disappointed and yet not totally surprised.
907798256608055297 2017-09-12 02:49:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 His proposed tax plan and budget would add trillions to deficit.

907795954367168512 2017-09-12 02:39:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 Thanks for the info. In my book the biggest rino is the one with a big head of Orange hair.
907679132879933440 2017-09-12 18:55:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 Is a RHINO the male equiv. of a Cougar? Or is there more to it?
907655470512558081 2017-09-12 17:21:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Denying science that emphatically states that burning fossil fuels is a mjr. cause of global warming will deny solutions.
907653797740204032 2017-09-12 17:15:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @POTUS @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs He is pretending to be a for real president but you and I know it's a short lived facade.
907652215833231360 2017-09-12 17:08:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 Agreed. But our do nothing Congress can't come up with a law.
907651769496428544 2017-09-12 17:06:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @BlOliverbl Are you implying that there are jobs that are not perfect. Then where is the beef?
907650890709991424 2017-09-12 17:03:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Denying the science that emphatically blames   global chaos on burning fossil will not fix this devistation.

907626633376485381 2017-09-12 15:27:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @christinawilkie That is denying science and ignorance from the White House. Enough to make you SCREAM!!!!!!!
907624829834219520 2017-09-12 15:19:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon Look up scapegoat.#ignorant Donny thinks rolling back regs would bring back coal jobs. #ignorant Coal is bad for miners & consumers.

907449377131724801 2017-09-11 03:42:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 It is illegal to hire someone without proof; 2 documents. Look up from w9.
907447811091959808 2017-09-11 03:36:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Why don't you publish your exit speech. Should be good for laughs. Da da that's all folks!
907446335330189314 2017-09-11 03:30:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 Obama inceased the border patrol in a big way. Net illegal flow was zero.
907444788470968320 2017-09-11 03:24:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 Mex will take their business elsewhere. They r doing that already w/corn. We lose jobs.
907444085404954630 2017-09-11 03:21:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 There is better things to do with $15 bil. A wall is stupid. Impracticle. Better ways to secure border.
907439939402571776 2017-09-11 03:05:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 Democrats are against it and so are fiscally conserv. Republicans.
907439163963842560 2017-09-11 03:02:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 That's is one big bucket. Currently the flow of illegals does not support the expense. Most illegals r ppl who entered legally.
907437853268901889 2017-09-11 02:56:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @dimontebello1 Only 1 problem big biz controls Congress. #repealcitzensunited
907436937996357632 2017-09-11 02:53:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 Building the wall is too expansive and impractical. Congress wont pay. Your biometric ID might b illegal
907433076275515392 2017-09-11 02:37:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Referring to yourself in the 3rd person and calling yourself a "street fighter" is egotistical and laughable. Sad..
907430602122592257 2017-09-11 02:28:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @Arn55998898 The situation with illegals in US is not simple. These ppl were here  for many yrs. They contributed to r econ. We need a humane solution.
907428185515724800 2017-09-11 02:18:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon They would rather collect then do hard physical labor. This is not slave labor. They can go back anytime they wish
907424877984063489 2017-09-11 02:05:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon @dimontebello1 The h1b program was created to help biz to bring in skilled labor. It's bring obused. Needs to b corrected.
907413993047969797 2017-09-11 01:22:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon The illegals do jobs no one else wants to do. Illegals spend money locally (create jobs). China & Bengaledesh r the job stealers.
907411896118206464 2017-09-11 01:13:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon Finding scapegoats is an old trick. Pointing to immigrants and saying they are taking your jobs is convenient scapegoat.
907410202072317952 2017-09-11 01:07:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon The point is that illegal immigrants  are not the reason people can't find jobs. Technology & globalization. Coal can't compete.
907387372492476416 2017-09-11 23:36:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @MarkRocon The problem is not a lack of jobs it's a lack of a trained work force. Trump needs to put the money where his mouth is.  .
907371372204216326 2017-09-11 22:32:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Amen, as I consider the source the words ring hollow.the more your lips lie the less we hear the words as sincere.

906995580160921607 2017-09-10 21:39:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Ppl voted 4 change, same as BHO. They despise the system that is run by rich lobbyists. They got more of the same on sreroids.
906992031737802752 2017-09-10 21:25:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen they also confirmed that Putin interfered in our election to get out fake pres elected. The truth will out. #trumpgate.

906955105458642944 2017-09-10 18:58:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen You should take your material on the road. We would be booing and jeering and throwing rotten tomatoes. You know that. So you tweet

906665790585360384 2017-09-09 23:49:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump This is a delicate issue of separation of church and state. The rule of law mattets.
906636260273467392 2017-09-09 21:51:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Tax reform is not done rickety split.  To do it right takes time.
906192537546784768 2017-09-08 16:28:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen A source Bteit Bart leaked that you claim to be a sensitive human bring. HA HA HA
906190830746161152 2017-09-08 16:21:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen It says that we are open minded and sympathetic. Progressive enough to realize that gender ID is not simple.

906141559044878337 2017-09-08 13:05:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The middle class is the engine that runs the economy. As they shrink the econ slows. They should get the tax breaks.
906139629497274368 2017-09-08 12:58:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Its pathetic that you made such an important decision for a petty vindictive reason. That is why you ate.

905597026649464832 2017-09-06 01:02:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants FBI, CIA, NSA, all stated definitively it was Putin. Putin only hacked dnc. Fake News created by Putin targeted Hillary w/lies.
905575952314503171 2017-09-06 23:38:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants I agree the system has to be fixed. To make it easier to vote legally. The Rep.s objective is to reduce numbers of voters so they can win.
905572939441070081 2017-09-06 23:26:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants Be specific. What don't u agree with? Putin's cyber attack? Trumps legitimate win? Putin's influence?
905571575398887424 2017-09-06 23:21:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants There is no proof that dead people are voting.
905570603150843905 2017-09-06 23:17:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants Voting is a dif. issue. The courts say gop is using the fake issue of voter fraud to make it difficult for some dems to vote.
905568449103056898 2017-09-06 23:08:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants What about making sure all have opportunity to vote? Voting on Sat.? Voting holiday?
905567409133715456 2017-09-06 23:04:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants The courts have decided if voters are required to have IDs some poor ppl will not vote. No proof of fraud. Are courts fake too?
905564537344098305 2017-09-06 22:53:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants More stupidity and hot air. I was looking for an intelligent debate. I am at the wrong pew.

905562848612536321 2017-09-06 22:46:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants The truth is not fake. Our most respected media verified this truth as stated by our intel agencies. Is your head permanently buried in sand
905559458612482052 2017-09-06 22:32:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants FBI, CIA, NSA said with a hi degree of confidence that Putin directed a cyber attack on our campaign. That's ok with you?! Traitor?
905556485177999361 2017-09-06 22:21:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants In court the GOP  could not prove vote fraud. Could not justify voter IDs.
905555871211692034 2017-09-06 22:18:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants What happened in Chgo was decades ago. Today's systems are much more reliable. I dont need an ID my signature is On file.

905546805924040710 2017-09-06 21:42:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants I WILL REPEAT! Fault is an open ended q. Putin's interference is UNDENIABLE. To what extent is being investigated. We'll see..
905545079380697088 2017-09-06 21:35:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants That's bs. There has never been any proof of any signif.  voter fraug. Makes no sense. We need voting holiday. GOP loses 4 sure.
905476831528321028 2017-09-06 17:04:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants No one knows. But why does our fake pres deny Putin's involvement?
905476241985343489 2017-09-06 17:02:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants Are u one of those that believe Putin did not invade our campaign in favor of Donny?
905472829235359744 2017-09-06 16:48:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants She blamed herself in the book and in a tv interview. The bridge to nowhere?
905472333959364609 2017-09-06 16:46:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants We know the book she wrote was not ghost written.
905472044531421185 2017-09-06 16:45:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants The one under investigation is our fake pres. Odds are he has a better chance of being behind bars.
905470942972915713 2017-09-06 16:41:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants if you read the book you'd know it's not true. She does blame herself. A lie off repeated is still a lie.
905465824626008066 2017-09-06 16:20:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen @ForeverNYGiants You may learn something. Afraid of the truth?
905465413546467328 2017-09-06 16:19:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen That is one man's opinion. An opinion I don't really trust.

901836707007537153 2017-08-27 16:00:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @johnpodesta @LarryJMcDonald ...the connection between these 2 is up to interpretation & bias. Mueller will fill in the blanks. The investigation is just begining.
901835615628644353 2017-08-27 15:55:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @johnpodesta @LarryJMcDonald Here is what we know for sure. Putin executed a mjr. campaign to help Trump win. Trump showed his bias toward the Russians shamelessly....

901273436789633026 2017-08-25 02:41:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald He targeted people racially, threw them in jail until they proved citizenship. Unconstitutional!
901271096275738624 2017-08-25 02:32:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald He did not know their legal status when he targeted them. All he knew was their color. That is racial profiling. Take a chill pill. Maybe 2

899834345539735552 2017-08-21 03:23:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If you want anyone to take you seriously stop blaming the media for your weanie ways. Grow a backbone and some balls.
899832605377531904 2017-08-21 03:16:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Stop this fake news crap. This only leads us to believe you are fake pres. Grow up!
899505677856636928 2017-08-20 05:37:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @marty_walsh @realDonaldTrump Your fanning of the hate crazies is costing  us a lot of .
899504958843883520 2017-08-20 05:34:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump It has not been this bad in along, long time. It's all you and you know it and you like it that way. You will lose!!!!
899504165294153729 2017-08-20 05:31:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Your to blame. They say your their hero. You inspire xenophobia, racism & hate. I am ashamed to have u as our pres. RESIGN!!!!!
899502800337502212 2017-08-20 05:25:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Takes one to know one!
899500180055183361 2017-08-20 05:15:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead Yes there are. There are countries where they provide good med care for all. Costs less then what we pay. We can do  it.
899498190189330433 2017-08-20 05:07:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead I hear you. Dems are more sensitive to your plight whereas the GOP  is all about taking care of the rich. Good luck to you.
899466177575084033 2017-08-20 03:00:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead I can't believe you don't qualify for premium subsidies or Medicaide
899401140487540737 2017-08-20 22:41:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead I am legal. No health ins. Break my neck. $1 mil hospital bill. We all pay for that. Get the point?
899388693047382020 2017-08-20 21:52:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @sjreidhead You need to look into getting insurance from ACA . You may b pleasantly surprised.
899387680135446529 2017-08-20 21:48:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead I don't mean to scare u but we social security, unemployment comp., Medicare, these are socialist ideas.
899386650438103040 2017-08-20 21:44:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead No. If we have freedom and I don't buy health ins and I get injured,  go to emergency room they have to treat me. We all pay for that.
899385755851730944 2017-08-20 21:40:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead Are we taking ACA or some other piece of junk health ins.?
899384388756140033 2017-08-20 21:35:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead The Heritage Foundation proposed mandated hlth  ins because they were tired of paying 4 the uninsured who showed up at emergency rooms.
899381906214723585 2017-08-20 21:25:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead It is not different if all were required to have hlth ins. healthy and sick the ins co would be able to offer cheaper ins.
899381024370700288 2017-08-20 21:22:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead Freedom works when U can shop 4 best & cheapest. When you have a heart attack there is no shopping. You need a well managed system.
899379523040489473 2017-08-20 21:16:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead I'm my state all drivers must carry auto ins. This keeps ins costs down. GOP does not want that 4 h'lth  ins. Stupid!
899378629813121025 2017-08-20 21:12:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead It's not the ins that got expensive. Prescriptions, hospitals, doctors got more exp. We need one payer system.
899377110820823045 2017-08-20 21:06:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead If you live in NM and travel to Nevada and need med attention your covered.
899376494476234756 2017-08-20 21:04:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead That is a total lie.https://www.healthinsurance.org/obamacare/how-to-keep-your-health-insurance-when-you-move-to-another-state/
899374701725843457 2017-08-20 20:56:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @VP @RBReich @4AnimalLife He is worthless and spineless. He sure knows how to kiss ass. Pathetic.
899374021413928965 2017-08-20 20:54:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @RBReich I am shamed to be an American. When will the nightmare end?
899368234297774081 2017-08-20 20:31:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead We are the only mjr  country in the world w/o managed health care.We need to wise up or its will gets worse. Trump has no solution.
899365414618189824 2017-08-20 20:19:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead B4 ACA med costs were skyrocketing. ACA needed fixes. GOP  said F U. Their plan would be worse. Good luck with that!
899361055247413248 2017-08-20 20:02:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead The only way to keep costs dn is if  everyone is in. If we all get good ins, stay healthy. Overall med costs stay lo. Worldwide that works.
899262570879700993 2017-08-20 13:31:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead 25 mil more people have ins that never had before. They pref. it to G O P plans. GOP  sabatoged ACA. Now they have no good replacement.
899257429392797700 2017-08-20 13:10:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead Based on what? He got us out of Great Recession.  Saved Auto Industry. 25 mil people got h'lth ins. Iran agreed to no nukes. PEACE!
899255486566080517 2017-08-20 13:03:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead For obstruction of justice. He fired Comey for Russian investigation.
899254503442194432 2017-08-20 12:59:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @CollinRugg @sjreidhead I lived through it.  He was the 17th best pres. according to historians. Record job cresation. No wars.
899125131221618688 2017-08-19 04:25:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @sjreidhead @CollinRugg Trumps ideas all suck. He has a full time crew walking back every piece of garbage he utters. Worst presidency  ever!
899123773785374720 2017-08-19 04:19:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @sjreidhead @CollinRugg The best idea ever - impeach our fake pres.
899120699117359104 2017-08-19 04:07:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @sweetnonnie @tribelaw I would rather sleep on a park bench than in a Trump hotel.
899118108455178241 2017-08-19 03:57:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We will come together to fight your worthless, destructive "leadership". #resign #impeach.
898974910504026112 2017-08-19 18:28:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump He & U are fanning and encouraging hate racism and bigotry. U will lose!!
898929727242743808 2017-08-19 15:28:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @bmangh @DearAuntCrabby He is a shitty pres. and a shitty human being but let's not stray from the truth he is a very wealthy man. That is where he gets his cred.
898033372336934913 2017-08-16 04:06:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Don't push him. He's crazier than you.
898031381908992000 2017-08-16 03:59:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump  I follow you. I don't like you. Making sure you know we are not that stupid. You're the emperor with no clothes.
898028935992283136 2017-08-16 03:49:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Lies. Lies. Lies.http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/216125/trump-job-approval-rating-new-low.aspx
898027478320631808 2017-08-16 03:43:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If you go away that may happen. Pretty please.
898026296600612864 2017-08-16 03:38:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Your getting better at the spin (lie). How stupid do you think we are. They disbanded before your announcement.
898024895036231680 2017-08-16 03:33:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @MayorGimenez @realDonaldTrump The courts will decide the rule of law. Are you getting used to losing in court. You need to yell at judges some more.
898023567002095617 2017-08-16 03:27:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Give it up! Resign!
897531760841338881 2017-08-15 18:53:41 UTC <michaelkaf> As a first generation  holocaust survivor I hate Nazis fervently. I love free speech. Let them speak.
897506320772943875 2017-08-15 17:12:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @nytdavidbrooks Just not in the WH.
897504352058843137 2017-08-15 17:04:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @nytdavidbrooks  I thought your article today in the NYT  had a lot of meat to it. Looking forward to more on modesty and moderatiom.
897480571441565696 2017-08-15 15:30:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @LarryJMcDonald So now they both have that in common too.
897480172592648192 2017-08-15 15:28:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @LarryJMcDonald Google David Duke.
897305343906258944 2017-08-14 03:53:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @LarryJMcDonald How else do you explain Trumps immediate bash of the K K K. Maybe he is just too nice. HA HA HA.
897303071612600320 2017-08-14 03:44:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @LarryJMcDonald They exist. They have gotten bigger and bolder since Trump.
897301586854260736 2017-08-14 03:39:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @LarryJMcDonald That's what I heard. Even if it's 5% off it still terrible. The extreme right is bigger than you think.
897271196424777728 2017-08-14 01:38:18 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Maybe now you will get the message.
897268674272382980 2017-08-14 01:28:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @LarryJMcDonald His approval ratings are down to 33% He can't afford to lose his hard core.
897266189910642688 2017-08-14 01:18:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @LarryJMcDonald He may not mean it. But politically appealing to the far right has worked for him. Its a big chunk of his base.
897265011743219712 2017-08-14 01:13:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @LarryJMcDonald The Klan broke off and found welcoming arms in the deep red south
897264095925342208 2017-08-14 01:10:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @LarryJMcDonald Just for the recrd Hitler had some Jewish lineage. His reactions were forced.
897243598273622020 2017-08-14 23:48:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You need to react from YOUR heart not from media criticism
897242447922724864 2017-08-14 23:44:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump FIRE BANNON! Your fake words have to be accompanied by some actions.
896908399165755392 2017-08-13 01:36:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @FBI @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Especially when the cameras are on. Then it's political speeches.
896569129855066113 2017-08-12 03:08:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @GlennThrush @KCBoyd3  Silence, or lack of outrage is a form of affirmation. Shame on you, fake pres.
896564960398123011 2017-08-12 02:51:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump I m old enough to know that "law & order" were code words for let's bash the heads of the hippies.
896218019826991104 2017-08-11 03:53:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Even that, if true, stinks. I don't believe a lying piece of shot like you.
896215999221051395 2017-08-11 03:45:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You realize that this man has killed members of his own family and you expect to scare him. Which one of you is crazier?
896129027571724288 2017-08-11 21:59:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Don't concentrate on the present at the expense of our future. Don't put our environment at peril. Fin'l inst. need to be regulated.
896049081054765057 2017-08-11 16:42:03 UTC <michaelkaf> If Kim wanted to use nuclear weapons he would not threaten to do it. He would do it. He wants recognition of his greatness.
895814967189880832 2017-08-10 01:11:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @FBI @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald I don't my the hot air. I do mind them playing politics at our expense.
895814263624785920 2017-08-10 01:08:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Hey Lar  I sense a little agreement. It's been fun chatting with u.
895813586454540288 2017-08-10 01:06:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald The issue is money. If you have lots of it you can get away with murder. O J. Trump is trying. Let's hope he fails. U know I'm right.
895811139224739840 2017-08-10 00:56:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @FBI @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald That's the problem they keep doing. Wasting our money and nothing. What is that def. Of insanity.
895810447315697664 2017-08-10 00:53:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald We'll see if Sessions can do any better. Huge waste of money!
895810002765488128 2017-08-10 00:52:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I bet current investigation will end up nowhere too. Speaking of wasting money.
895809228186714112 2017-08-10 00:48:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @FBI @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald What is that old saying, put up or shut up.
895808838569512960 2017-08-10 00:47:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Still unsubstantiated hot  air!
895808353905070082 2017-08-10 00:45:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Still unsubstantiated not air.
895807654764916736 2017-08-10 00:42:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @FBI @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald G O P does not give up EZ. 16 Bin Ghoazi investigations. 60 Rep &  Replace votes. Face it no   criminal act there.
895788807622201345 2017-08-10 23:27:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald That is not true. That your biased unsubstantiated opinion.
895786764085932033 2017-08-10 23:19:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @FBI @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald If there was anything illegal there Darryl Issa would have gotten her. Face it there was nothing there.
895734127990906880 2017-08-10 19:50:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @FBI @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Mistakes happen. You keep underestimating G O P power to enforce the law. They tried vigorously and nothing.
895732527641628673 2017-08-10 19:44:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald She destroyed before she rec'd subpoena
895731901566267392 2017-08-10 19:41:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald No she did not. That is why she is not locked up.
895729768318078976 2017-08-10 19:33:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald It was not evidence when she destroyed it. I can destroy my emails w/o going to jail.
895729017013383170 2017-08-10 19:30:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Get back to me when they find anything. No surprise with G O P in charge.
895728416024125440 2017-08-10 19:27:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @FBI @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Quantities mattet. She was deemed to be neglegent but not intentionally harmful. They found a small number of docs where the C wasn't clear
895726182737616896 2017-08-10 19:18:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Her intent was to keep her privacy against relentless G O P surveillance.
895725390987132928 2017-08-10 19:15:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Intent is crucial in determining guilt or innocence and penalties imposed. No matter what your superiors say.
895724557608333313 2017-08-10 19:12:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @CNN @LarryJMcDonald That is unfortunate. The Bachlorette is very fine TV.
895723607237775360 2017-08-10 19:08:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald She destroyed personal emails before they were subpoenaed
895723020106563585 2017-08-10 19:06:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Intent in criminal law is paramount. Your going to have to prove that it makes no dif. in this case
895721523796987906 2017-08-10 19:00:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald I find that hard to believe. If there is no intent = misdemeanor. G O P perused vigorously no conviction.
895719410379501568 2017-08-10 18:52:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @CNN @LarryJMcDonald Ratings don't mean anything. Both FOX and Hitler are very popular.
895718664393150464 2017-08-10 18:49:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Everyone deserves a trial. Don't get duped by the right wing fascist hype.
895718099848232960 2017-08-10 18:46:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald When you have a pres. who lies to his people someone has to stand up to him. Most documents not classified.

895697421937909761 2017-08-10 17:24:41 UTC <michaelkaf> Does anyone take Trump tweets seriously? He is a joke. Good entertainment. Ridiculous. Full of lies.Let's not forget that.
895691189726347265 2017-08-10 16:59:55 UTC <michaelkaf> The pres. tweets have been full of lies and BS. I am sure the N Koreans recognize that. Not to worry.
895688909811838976 2017-08-10 16:50:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump  We have learned to accept ur tweets as entertainment. You have lost any cred. When you threaten N K they too are giggling.
895653174610198528 2017-08-10 14:28:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump That and a dollar still want but you a cup of coffee.
895652630625738753 2017-08-10 14:26:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We were number one even as you lied about it during your campaign. You have done thing but lie, lie, lie....
895651431742681088 2017-08-10 14:21:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You did nothing to help. Now you blame everyone but you. Try being a leader!
895519659105144832 2017-08-09 05:38:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @ChelseaClinton @SteveBannen Is there anything that is his fault? Put up a sign on his desk "the buck stops anywhere but here".
895100207406473218 2017-08-08 01:51:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald The sign on his desk says the buck stops anywhere but here.
895092718384414720 2017-08-08 01:21:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald He lied about crowd size. Pictures told the truth. He lied about Obama hacking, FBI told the truth. Thank God for leakers (whistleblowers).
895088540882796545 2017-08-08 01:05:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald You & I don't matter. I guess Trump doesn't matter so much either. He is about as resolute as a fart in the  wind.
895086827379449857 2017-08-08 00:58:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Yes it is. Recognized worldwide for its integrity and journalistic ethics. They bash Trump with the truth.
895068303647027201 2017-08-08 23:44:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald The first sentence mentions intent.
895066088635060224 2017-08-08 23:35:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald If our exports drop we lose jobs.
895065416015466500 2017-08-08 23:33:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald He did nothing to support the h'care bill. When it failed he blamed GOP.
895064381599490049 2017-08-08 23:29:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Intent always matters in the law. Especially criminal law.

895015149337182209 2017-08-08 20:13:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald It reflects badly on you and your cohorts in your echo chamber.
895014279384006656 2017-08-08 20:10:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald This is the man who will not take responsibility for anything. He only cares for himself.
895013632966316036 2017-08-08 20:07:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald You have a pres. whose lies are repudiated  on a daily basis.
895012682373484544 2017-08-08 20:03:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Meanwhile they are taking their business elsewhere.
895012214930894850 2017-08-08 20:01:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald The GOP  had a big target on her forever.  Zero results. Give it up. When he was elected he said forgive & forget. He knew he had nothing
895009872936357888 2017-08-08 19:52:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Your getting on the wrong horse. Dave your money.
895009181769576449 2017-08-08 19:49:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald That attitude will only get us isolated. We need  allies. You know better than that.
895008407031336960 2017-08-08 19:46:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald That hype is getting old.
895008105003614211 2017-08-08 19:45:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Why was Trump so intent on saving him? Maybe because he was acting at his request. He did not want him to make a deal and spill the beans.
895007196408414208 2017-08-08 19:41:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald The emperor has no clothes. Until he wears stipes.
895006541350350849 2017-08-08 19:39:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald What are they afraid of. They have a majority In WH and congress. Maybe the truth scares them.
895005842214408192 2017-08-08 19:36:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Your party in CYA mode. If and when they indict him they want to be on the right side.
895005214742282241 2017-08-08 19:34:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald You are in a small minority of non morons. B honest there is enough there to investigate.
895002743424856064 2017-08-08 19:24:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Your party wants that "hoax" investigated. What does tell you?
895001450614489088 2017-08-08 19:19:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald He investigated and found nothing. His announcement impacted her campaign so he is not On her side.
895000169858682880 2017-08-08 19:14:03 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Your pres. feels that ethics, morals and our courts are not for him. Don't talk to me about the const. Huge double standard.

894919807342129152 2017-08-08 13:54:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald That is not the point. The vast majority of our representatives doubt his innocence. Wake up and face reality.

894073584863371264 2017-08-05 05:52:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @FrankCastle2017 The point is that the Latinos in FL are immigrants that are employers that create jobs. Good for US!

893998516120555520 2017-08-05 00:53:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald If you are innocent you  should not b afraid of the courts. Especially if you can hire good lawyers.

893966029537366016 2017-08-05 22:44:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Our constitution made sure that we have checks & balances. To control a fascist pres who is trying to override the courts. #dictatorship.
893964760332587008 2017-08-05 22:39:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald You think that all those all over the world who do not like him are left wing socialists. And you call me a moron? You are dillusional.
893963660464455680 2017-08-05 22:35:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Donny is being investigated by a Special Prosecutor. Congress has introduced bills to keep him from firing Mueller. Nobody trusts him.
893960723918970880 2017-08-05 22:23:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald His approval rating at 33% and the fact that the GOP  doesn't want him makes me hopeful that you are wrong.
893959644154138624 2017-08-05 22:19:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Laughing stock. The whole world except for Russia & Israel think he is an idiot.
893958830589194240 2017-08-05 22:16:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald The Senate & House think Trump is not  exactly impartial when it comes to Russia. Putin has something on Donny. Golden Shower video??
893957795560771584 2017-08-05 22:12:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald That is highly unlikely. I don't think GOP wants him to run again.
893895216788369408 2017-08-05 18:03:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Jail or impeach? As long as he is out. Nobody will cry.
893894547708801024 2017-08-05 18:00:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Why did the WHOLE Senate not trust him to impose sanction on Russia?
893894037450752000 2017-08-05 17:58:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald They are ignoring him because they are tired of getting nothing done. He is obstructive & destructive. Gotta stop listening to Bannon.
893892430281494528 2017-08-05 17:52:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Yeah, yeah, yeah. Facts matter. This fake pres has been  caught by one lie after another. We are the lagging stock of the whole world.

893889950487281664 2017-08-05 17:42:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Don't change the subject. It doesn't change the reality that Donny lies so much that it hard to keep track. We all lie but like him.
893888490508881920 2017-08-05 17:36:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald You know that for a fact. Why does he act so guilty?
893887913343188992 2017-08-05 17:34:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Not his party just the worthless destructive Trump.
893887158125305856 2017-08-05 17:31:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Than why are they ignoring him.
893886648706117632 2017-08-05 17:29:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald They have a lot more cred. than a fake pres who lies, lies, lies.
893886014434967558 2017-08-05 17:26:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald They voted Republican. Bill Kristol still votes as a Republican. He just hates Trump. With good reason.
893884325128753152 2017-08-05 17:20:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Both sides of the aisle wish he was back. Donny is  a dissaster.
893883460145885185 2017-08-05 17:16:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Duly elected is no license to lie incessantly. He has lost credibility even from GOP.
893882930795237376 2017-08-05 17:14:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @LarryJMcDonald He created JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. lowered int rates. Made sure our banks were fail ptoof.
893881992022044672 2017-08-05 17:10:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews @LarryJMcDonald Funny how as he gets closer to jail our fake pres he becomes more and more corrupt.
893881063323443200 2017-08-05 17:07:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Funny how our fake pres. has created in his wake a shit load of new "liberLs" forms prev. Republicans.
893880061237002240 2017-08-05 17:03:08 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald If our fake pres did not lie so much we wouldn't need leakers (whistleblowers).
893879358552768512 2017-08-05 17:00:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @FrankCastle2017 Stats show that immigrants opened up small businesses and created jobs. Paid taxes. Contributed to our economic well being.
893878512389697536 2017-08-05 16:56:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We were On our way before you got here thanks to  BHO. Your actions will ruin our future. Dregulation, Rep. & Repl. Lowering taxes on rich.

893856806895628289 2017-08-05 15:30:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @DHSgov @fema @realDonaldTrump One way to stop leaks is to tell the truth. If you lie the whistleblowers have to "leak" the truth.
893855782067998720 2017-08-05 15:26:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @chucktodd Are they leakers or whistleblowers? If the pres. lies isnt it the responsibility of employees to tell the truth?
893510504605519872 2017-08-04 16:34:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Thank God for fake media. 33 percent approval and going down. Well deserved.
893507752676524032 2017-08-04 16:23:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @SteveBannen Our president is so worthy of bashing. Reps Dems and especially independents. Don't fret there is Putin. He has nice things to say.

892945403947225088 2017-08-02 03:09:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump None of it is your doing. You have done nothing. All you want to do is help the rich. They don't want it or need it!
892944036830597121 2017-08-02 03:03:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Corps and the rich are doing very well. The rest of us are still forgotten. You are not keeping your promise. Can't wait 4 your impeachment
892940636722253824 2017-08-02 02:50:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The reason our economy prospered is our open door policy. Are you going to destroy the statute of liberty?
892939224399450112 2017-08-02 02:44:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Can you really blame me for not believing you. You are the proverbial boy who cried "wolf". You are a pathological liar. That is a shame....
892164873412640769 2017-07-31 23:27:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramuicci are you referring to your glorious  career at the WH? That would make a great book. LOL
892163575904698368 2017-07-31 23:22:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramuicci don't let the door your ass on your way out.
892162927444324356 2017-07-31 23:19:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramuicci you are full of it. Did you get a golden parachute?
892162620144398336 2017-07-31 23:18:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramuicci How did you ever make a dime? You have no common sense.
892161855644467200 2017-07-31 23:15:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramuicci good riddance to bad garbage
891330613525061634 2017-07-29 16:12:33 UTC <michaelkaf> @JackPosobiec If true(doubtful), why has Trump so many enemies in his own party? Maybe he is the worst pres. ever.
891165019563581440 2017-07-28 05:14:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @AriMelber @TheBeatWithAri You dont miss a beat.
891162617913409536 2017-07-28 05:04:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @sweetnonnie @PalmerReport Let's not forget his fellow Republicans on his Session bashing and Russian sanctions.
891153475823947777 2017-07-28 04:28:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramucci  When you find  the leaker(s) will you be gone?
891152347598114817 2017-07-28 04:24:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramucci Which one is the leaker?
891151594699579393 2017-07-28 04:21:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @TheAdvocateMag @POTUS @Scaramucci Trump is as consistent as a fart in the wind. In more ways than one. P U.
891147234888355840 2017-07-28 04:03:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramucci I guess that makes it OK to bring up all your past slams on Donny. How many times a day do you have to kiss his fat ass?
890848182749589504 2017-07-28 08:15:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramuicci You're a sick bully. John McCane will squash u like the vermon that you are.  You gotta go. NOW!!
890045032337637376 2017-07-25 03:04:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @Nikluk @maddogg2463 I have had the same thought. His policy to attack and erase anything Obama goes to that theory.
889903780451557381 2017-07-25 17:42:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramucci The B S never stops. Keep shoveling you can be the answer to all our energy ptoblems.
889895756370464770 2017-07-25 17:10:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramuicci You are as sleazy as they come. You are going to fit right in.
889895060854243332 2017-07-25 17:08:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramuicci Why does he act so guilty if he is innocent? There is too much smoke to believe there is no fire. Good luck spinning that.
889894049225822208 2017-07-25 17:04:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @Scaramuicci When you check in the thesaurus under BS there is your smiling face. If u coudnt shovel it you'd b out of job.
889336125013282821 2017-07-23 04:07:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @robreiner Loved you as the meat head.
889335842757640193 2017-07-23 04:06:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @robreiner Truth is stranger than fiction. No one would believe it. Not even in a comic book.
889249951875817473 2017-07-23 22:24:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump There is only so much lying and unethical behavior they can take. If members of ur own team don't support u it's time to look in the mirror.
889247285959438336 2017-07-23 22:14:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @SenJohnMcCain @MeghanMcCain We are all praying for his speech recovery.
889238038085341184 2017-07-23 21:37:24 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Evidence, or the lack thereof aside. If he is innocent why not let it b and go on with the job of being a pres.?  Take Sen. Grahams advice
889204520441585665 2017-07-23 19:24:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Sanctions is what brought them to and adhere to the Iran nuclear agreement.
889198657526005760 2017-07-23 19:00:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald When red states imposed draconian anti immigrant laws they could not find replacements for the illegals who fled. http://americasvoice.org/blog/alabamas-anti-immigrant-law-backfires-again/

889193286614777856 2017-07-23 18:39:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTumpr Not America alone. Support Paris accord. Don't destroy our environment.
889192804525715457 2017-07-23 18:37:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTumpr If we had a pres that could get something done.
889191808454053889 2017-07-23 18:33:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTumpr Obama
889188403094450177 2017-07-23 18:20:10 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald If you are having a heart attack you are not going to go shopping for the best, cheapest hospital. Not like buying a car.
889187167381196800 2017-07-23 18:15:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald I understand that open market principals do not work on medical care. The whole world knows that. It has to b managed.
889168678649987073 2017-07-23 17:01:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Russian investigation is not over. Our fake pres is acting like a guilty man. So I am betting that he is. We'll see.
889167597840760832 2017-07-23 16:57:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald A repeal would b too destructive. Every major social plan went thru changes. ACA encountered nothing but obstructionism.
889166945584590848 2017-07-23 16:54:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald That is not what the voters want. That is not what the medical community wants. ACA is working all over our country. It needs some fixes.
889165350964744193 2017-07-23 16:48:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Trickle down economics does not work. A rich business owner will go broke quickly without customers.
889164473172455424 2017-07-23 16:45:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Obama's policies have kept us out of meaningless self defeating wars. He created effective coalitons. Donny will get us in deep shit.
889163090809544704 2017-07-23 16:39:35 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald You lie like a rug. I am looking for stimulating debate. Show some integrity.
889162506341634049 2017-07-23 16:37:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald We had the best recovery in our current global ecnomy. That is a better comparison.
889161080727101440 2017-07-23 16:31:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald That goes both ways. U warship the 2nd even tho it's a const. right subject to limitations. No dif than freedom of speech, religion, etc.
889158629043122177 2017-07-23 16:21:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The market experts are saying that they no longer pay attention to the goof. They have no confidence that he can get anything done.
889157931987595264 2017-07-23 16:19:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The market went up 300% during BHO's admin. He actually did somethings to cause that. Stimulus, QE. Donald has not done anything.
889156144098414592 2017-07-23 16:11:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald They are angry at the proposed plans that will make them lose their ins. They realize that ACA is the best plan around.
888800869369745408 2017-07-22 16:40:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Do you find it that hard to believe that people are pissed at the prospect of losing their health ins. Yo would b no different.
888795186591125506 2017-07-22 16:17:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald How about that suck sucking Putin. He violated us. I would like  To wipe that smirk off his face.
888793731268304898 2017-07-22 16:11:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The major reason that the stock market is so high today is Obama's stimulus in the form of low interest rates.
888606700583964672 2017-07-21 03:48:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The airfield was up and running the next day.
888605151061315584 2017-07-21 03:42:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald The writers of the const did not mean it to be etched in stone. They provided for amedments. A living document.
888603009701249024 2017-07-21 03:34:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Translation: duh!
888602628191604736 2017-07-21 03:32:30 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald When Obama exited he a had continuous job creation record with full employment. He created 183K jobs per mo. in 2016. Donny's av. 171K.
888600063878078464 2017-07-21 03:22:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Your response another "duh". By actual count Donny lies 4+ lies per day.
888599347264466944 2017-07-21 03:19:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald It was a farce. An empty gesture that gave Putin and Assad a good chuckle.
888598619154255872 2017-07-21 03:16:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The middle class, u & me, are the real job creators. Without our purchasing power your "job creators" got squat.
888597618615603200 2017-07-21 03:12:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald I have a Math degree with an econ minor and a CPA. I  bet to differ.
888596579111882754 2017-07-21 03:08:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Your representatives know beter. That is why they are not voting for it.
888595984347004928 2017-07-21 03:06:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Lots of investigations and nothing. Give it up. Another fake scandal.
888594075984723968 2017-07-21 02:58:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald That's pretty close to "duh".
888593390362865668 2017-07-21 02:55:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald They come here illegally to eke out a miserable living to feed their families. They do back breaking jobs that no one else will do.
888591184079327232 2017-07-21 02:47:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald War needs to be the last resort. Have we forgotten Iraq.
888477110829961216 2017-07-21 19:13:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Point being, don't accept the propaganda that everything sucks. It's not perfect but we have it better than most.
888444543422607361 2017-07-21 17:04:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Political donations are not tax deductible. Non for profit donations are. Allowing 504(d) orgs to do political activities let's people cheat
888402540894859264 2017-07-21 14:17:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Social Security, unemployment comp., Medicare, Medicaid. Yes, we are socialists in more ways than u want to admit. Comrade.
888401304426610688 2017-07-21 14:12:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Another brilliant retort. I only have so much room on my frig. That comrade b s is getting old.
888272801060147200 2017-07-20 05:41:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald When you don't have a real answer you just "duh". You could save a lot of time that way.
888271486267514881 2017-07-20 05:36:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald Translation: they vote your  way. They support your issues and interpret the const. as you see it.
888270060631932929 2017-07-20 05:31:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Thanks for making my point.
888269584909742080 2017-07-20 05:29:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The science is settled. As sure as the earth is round. We are the only country  still debating. Thanks to the G O P science deniers.
888268415433007113 2017-07-20 05:24:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald It seems like most of the people in the know are progressive; Scholars, journalists, teachers, scientists, just saying...
888266895538831362 2017-07-20 05:18:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Stimulus created millions of jobs. The auto industry was saved. The European saw how well it worked here & they copied us.
888265742008827908 2017-07-20 05:13:50 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald At last count Trump was averaging 4 lies per day. He has taken it to a while new level. He is pathological.
888264708498669572 2017-07-20 05:09:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The U.N. & Trump have signed off twice that they  are abiding by the terms of the agreement.  Better than going to war.
888263478586163209 2017-07-20 05:04:51 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald What disadvantage? We were cutting into China's trade territory. It was a good move. Trump is isolating us. Not such a good move.
888213051262078979 2017-07-20 01:44:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Don't kid yourself. The ones investigating Binghazi were just as powerful.
888212201533837314 2017-07-20 01:41:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Not according to the people who r screaming @ ur GOP represntatives.
888211675366739970 2017-07-20 01:39:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Lower taxes on the wealthy.  Who does eliminating the estate taxes help? Who will make up the shortfall?
888210841715302406 2017-07-20 01:35:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Unlike Trump who bombed Syria right after he gave Putin the heads up.
888209740291035137 2017-07-20 01:31:18 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald R you that ignorant? We have the best military in the world. Do little research.
888209043369709568 2017-07-20 01:28:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Not that simple. There is justice. People who lived many yrs need a chance to make it right. We must n humane.
887721895197585409 2017-07-19 17:12:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald There is no country in the world that we could not wipe out if we so desired.
887717575529988098 2017-07-19 16:55:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald You could have just said DUH!
887717318813462530 2017-07-19 16:54:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Obama began a normalization process with Cuba that was working. Trump had a hard on for anything Obama. Stupid! Destructive!
887716634068226049 2017-07-19 16:51:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Obama knew that civilian deaths due the military aggressiveness created terrorists so he was careful. His policy worked, ISIS was on the run
887715738743648256 2017-07-19 16:48:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @TheDemocrats @LarryJMcDonald I watch FOX and they do lie. You need to be more aware and check the facts.
887715192381079552 2017-07-19 16:46:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald See ya in 2018. Your party talks a good game but their actions only favor the wealthy. If you r not than you r kind of stupid.
887714628188475393 2017-07-19 16:43:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald ACA went through an open process. GOP plans did not and appropriately they died.  Colossal failure after 8 yrs of  Repeal & Replace.
887714014079438851 2017-07-19 16:41:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Brilliant answer. I am going to hang that one up on my frig with a star.
887713558741622785 2017-07-19 16:39:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Dont put words in my mouth. It was a terrible thing. It just wasnt Hillary's or Obama's fault. Dozens of investigations. Nobody charged!
887712695444811776 2017-07-19 16:36:14 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Democrats were against TPP. Obama went to the GOP and got the votes to pass it.
887712321258356737 2017-07-19 16:34:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The Iran nuclear agreement stopped them from getting the bomb. They are living up to that agreement. Cant argue w/success.
887711349257760768 2017-07-19 16:30:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald What was wrong was how these non for profits broke the law. This is my field I am a CPA.
887710914748846084 2017-07-19 16:29:09 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Donald did lie incessantly during the election. You know that and I know that. Dont shovel the BS.
887710005151092736 2017-07-19 16:25:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald I show u that most studies agree and you give me meaningless verbiage. Who is the blind sheep? Facts matter!
887709342056812545 2017-07-19 16:22:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald These are historians. They do not rank them by party affiliation. How is that for common sense? Why r scholars liberal? ther r smarter.
887708433771790336 2017-07-19 16:19:18 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald That is a myth invented by bus. that want to limit regs. Scientists all over the world and the best universities agree.The evidence is there
887707448433356800 2017-07-19 16:15:23 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald That is not a humane self serving solution. We need to fix the system that allows people to stay illegally. Wall wont do that.
887706505558061056 2017-07-19 16:11:38 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Those are facts. you name me one country that has a better military or economy than our.http://armedforcesmuseum.com/todays-top-ten-armies-military-powers-in-the-world/http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022415/worlds-top-10-economies.asp
887705173761683456 2017-07-19 16:06:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald If conserv. judges do not legislate from the bench then why are you so anxious to load up the court with them.
887458278992687104 2017-07-18 23:45:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald Citizens United gave the $ way too much power in selecting our candidates. Not my idea of freedom/democracy. Thanks to conservative judges.
887446604977983490 2017-07-18 22:58:53 UTC <michaelkaf> @ONowland @sarahkendzior Trump was desperate for an ounce of legitimacy. A shred of good news. Too little, too late.
887438808169537537 2017-07-18 22:27:54 UTC <michaelkaf> Emerging pattern. We are moving on and ignoring our fake president.
887438281927000064 2017-07-18 22:25:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @missmayim Youre delicious Mayim. Love you, love your character. Mayim, mayim, mayim, mayim, mayim bessason. ( hebrew song )
887334224084205568 2017-07-18 15:32:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Your failed promises and lies are getting boring and tiresome.
887333917891670016 2017-07-18 15:31:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump We were let down by believing your promise that you could do better than ACA. Its EZ to destroy not so EZ to create.
887333512881295361 2017-07-18 15:29:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump If you want Dems to join in. Work with them to fix the popular ACA instead of making sure it fails. YOU are destroying it.
887332877897216000 2017-07-18 15:26:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump The trick to getting things done is to propose bills that actually help the majority of voters. Not just the rich.
887332607062667264 2017-07-18 15:25:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Its tough to live by the rules. You cant blame your incompetence on the Dems. Obama fought  real obstruction and got things done.
887028332939948032 2017-07-17 19:16:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald When he left office our economy and our military were number one. No one even close. Dont fall the blatant lies and hype.
887023272768012288 2017-07-17 18:56:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump CBO does not agree with you. Tens of millions will lose coverage. You promised cheaper and better. So far all we got is lies.
887021068275388416 2017-07-17 18:47:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You mean most ignorant sleazy politicians. Manafort should have known the law. He cant claim ignorance.

886788107428913154 2017-07-16 03:22:15 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald How do you know that? Very convenient baseless reply.
886787746303528960 2017-07-16 03:20:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Again your opinion.  I still haven't changed my mind on that.  You keep parroting  right wing hype.
886787144471248896 2017-07-16 03:18:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Voters believed Donalds ridiculous lies. Our military is the best in the world. No one comes close. Same goes for our economy.
886785779657322502 2017-07-16 03:13:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald IRS scandal. Conservative non for profits were supporting GOP candidates. That is illegal.  Another GOP fake scandal. Smoke w/o fire.
886784950304985090 2017-07-16 03:09:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Foreign policy; got us out of horrific trillion dollar wars. Iran treaty.  TPP. Built invaluable coalitions which our Donny is destroying.
886783748020338688 2017-07-16 03:04:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Benghazi was a GOP manufactured scandal, nothing ever proved. During GWs tenure 11 embassies attacked.
886783148192911360 2017-07-16 03:02:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Stimulus worked by most accounts.
886782843506089984 2017-07-16 03:01:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald ACA was a compromise that was destroyed by GOP. Now more popular than ever. GOP could not do better. They tried.
886782209608351744 2017-07-16 02:58:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald He admitted the Libya debacle.Loss of governors and legislators; gerrymandering, poor candidates, dark money.Historians still judge him well
886780925354311680 2017-07-16 02:53:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @TheDemocrats @LarryJMcDonald I saw FOX lie. When Ivanka got booed for defending her dad. FOX lied and said it was not true. Every news outlet disagreed. I say the tape.
886779141588209665 2017-07-16 02:46:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald ISIS; Trump has not deviated from Obama's plan. He has no plan  so he gives generals control. Stupid.
886777902012006402 2017-07-16 02:41:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Trump went back to a punishing Cuban government. That did not work for 50 yrs. Obama tried something that was popular here and in Cuba.
886777077038542851 2017-07-16 02:38:25 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The Iran deal he left as is. Turned out to do just what it was meant to do. Keep Iran from getting the bomb.
886776494248402944 2017-07-16 02:36:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald There is nobody like Trump. Unethical, liar (bigly). Bent on destroying our environment, alienates our allies, loves Putin.........
886695212332044289 2017-07-16 21:13:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald People desparate 4 change. System skewed for wealthy. Last 2 presidents prove it. Black and sleaze ball,
886693841377660928 2017-07-16 21:07:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald That is your opinion.  So far not worth so much.

886685950948110336 2017-07-16 20:36:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Obama stimulus saved our economy. Austerity, Romney's approach, did not work so well. Glad we had the right man at the helm
886685114419359746 2017-07-16 20:32:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @TheDemocrats @LarryJMcDonald CNN has a juggernaut editorial staff.  They do not lie or slant the news unlike FOX who does lie and is unabashedly biased.
886623436461756417 2017-07-16 16:27:54 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Your baseless attacking and haranguing of the press is DISTORTING OUR DEMOCRACY. They are telling the truth and u cant handle the truth.

886622234143600640 2017-07-16 16:23:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald You do realize u have said nothing.  All newspapers have retractions. The rest is just name calling. Your forte.
886621581862154240 2017-07-16 16:20:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The Democrats have always been for improving the lives of the people. The GOP for all their hot air has been the party of the wealthy.
886219014258741249 2017-07-15 13:40:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The pendulum swings both ways. With the reviled Trump in the WH our day will come sooner than later.  Impeach the idiot now.
886218070330679296 2017-07-15 13:37:07 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald You're all about winning.  Right or wrong. That is why your best defense is attack the messenger. Issues be damned.
886217025768611843 2017-07-15 13:32:58 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Not true. Dems care. ACA gave people health ins. Fighting for fair progressive taxes. Pro jobs. Stimulus that saved us from economic ruin.

886008891468914688 2017-07-14 23:45:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Were talking about a lying unethical sleaze. He is a flimflam man. He will tell you what you want to hear. The wizard behind the curtain.
886007342508249089 2017-07-14 23:39:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald You think he really has cards to show. The man is the biggest bluffer ever.  I do believe Putin will have his way with him.
886006210822119424 2017-07-14 23:35:16 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Joseph McCarthy and Nixon.
886004754203136001 2017-07-14 23:29:29 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Seriously, to your fake president lying comes as naturally as breathing.http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431755/donald-trumps-huge-lies
886002039515475968 2017-07-14 23:18:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Even if these polls are off by 10% I feel confident. I repeat the battles have not yet begun.
886000931241963520 2017-07-14 23:14:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald These publication have integrity and when they make errors they retract and correct ASAP. You president knowingly lies and doubles down.
884193950856249344 2017-07-09 23:34:00 UTC <michaelkaf> @Lawrence This like forming a neighborhood watch with the neighbor who robbed u. He will be glad to take the 1st watch. Hide the silverware.
884191515924471808 2017-07-09 23:24:19 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Is anyone reading these tweets? Do you even care what your voters are saying? Or is this a way street.

884182055168479234 2017-07-09 22:46:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You talked to him so you think you did all you can. That is BS. Grow a pair and restore our honor. We were violated. Everyone know 4 sure!
884181536752488453 2017-07-09 22:44:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump That is like closing the barn door after the cows have escaped. He got Syria. He wins again. You have been had.
884181201078104064 2017-07-09 22:43:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You lie. He did something. Why are you letting him get away scott free? More action less tweeting.
884180876812312583 2017-07-09 22:42:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump That is like forming a watch group with your neighbor that robbed u. He will be glad to take the 1st watch. Better hide the silverware.
884180282995343360 2017-07-09 22:39:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump They were not discussed because u did not want to start a tiff with your sweetheart. Is Mellania jealous?
884179878953857055 2017-07-09 22:38:05 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump This is not the first cease fire or the last they all failed. Give it a chance. Are you desperate for a win? Is putin throwing u a bone.
884179194049171456 2017-07-09 22:35:21 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Today we know that all those votes were a bluff/political stunt. They never had a better replacement and they still don't.
884177979357765637 2017-07-09 22:30:32 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald You will never win the debate that conservatives are better than liberals. I will never win the reverse. Rotten apples in every bunch.
884127441693921280 2017-07-09 19:09:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald I trust cockroaches more than I trust your fake president. The man reverses himself in mid sentence.
884125865503858693 2017-07-09 19:03:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald What are you a 5 yr old :I know what you are but what am I.  My dad is bigger than yours. Your a sissy. Your mom wears army boots. HA!
884123571907440640 2017-07-09 18:54:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald In Don's eyes Putin can do no wrong. A man who joined w/Syria to kill kids.He admires Duterte, a man killing thousands of his own. Dictators
884098037710237697 2017-07-09 17:12:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald By that premise your fake pres is the biggest liberal of all time.   http://trumplies.us/ https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html?_r=0http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/10/07/donald_trump_2005_tape_i_grab_women_by_the_pussy.html

884089247380234240 2017-07-09 16:37:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald His rhetoric did not change. A 71 yr old does not chg. He may fool u, yea who is not misguided, but not the majority or the courts.
884087453539344384 2017-07-09 16:30:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald The elections battle has not yet begun. Donald approval rating; US 38%, worldwide 22%. US independents disapprove of Don by 60%. 'nuf  said.
883818393912188929 2017-07-08 22:41:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald There is no one more misguided than a Trump supporter. I need a lot more than 140 char to list his shortcomings.

883384794293391366 2017-07-07 17:58:42 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald As always you attack the messenger. The EZ way to go. No need to disprove anything as long as u accept god's msg - liberals are scum.
883383852403752960 2017-07-07 17:54:57 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald That work is telling the truth. Our president is scared of the truth. As he should be.

883381439768690688 2017-07-07 17:45:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump What is shameful is you pulling out of the Paris Accord.  The whole world is appalled with that.

883132426519760896 2017-07-06 01:15:52 UTC <michaelkaf> @LarryJMcDonald Lets see. CNN is an award winning news outlet respected & trusted worldwide. FOX ,not so much. Lies always as much as our fake pres.
883120566894571520 2017-07-06 00:28:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You do realize that is hurting American oil producers. Creates job losses.

883119237736353793 2017-07-06 00:23:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump How does a lying sleaze like you have the audacity to attack CNN, the most respected and trusted news outlet in the world.
883117201565372416 2017-07-06 00:15:23 UTC <michaelkaf> @samuelprime @realDonaldTrump They are a blessing you are a curse.

883111271343828992 2017-07-06 23:51:49 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Deutschland, Deutschland uber alas!
883080035497848832 2017-07-06 21:47:41 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald The reason the lower courts denied ban is because Trump attacked muslims as a religion during the campaign. There are tapes. Stoking haters.
882999349260804097 2017-07-06 16:27:04 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald Calling them illegal is OK. Using inflammatory rhetoric like rapists tends to feed into racist xenophobic hatred. Hate crimes go up.
882982404515926021 2017-07-06 15:19:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald The courts have said that his travel ban was against the muslim religion based on his campaign speeches.

882980503816732673 2017-07-06 15:12:11 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald Their crimes are illegal entry and drugs for the most part. The vast majority come here to work hard and make a meager living....

882656874197286913 2017-07-05 17:46:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Are you ready for these meetings? When do you time to prepare. You are always tweeting. I am sure u know it all, right?
882640284424785922 2017-07-05 16:40:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald Yet u chose the EZ way out and attack the messenger.  Especially the ones demonized by the right.
882639899207270400 2017-07-05 16:38:45 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald "bringing drugs, bringing crime, theyre rapists," (stats dont support that)   His blanket attack of all muslims.

882455679197483008 2017-07-04 04:26:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald The messengers credibility does not change the the issue. If the devil says its raining and you stick your head out and get wet.............
882454926965829633 2017-07-04 04:23:44 UTC <michaelkaf> @splcenter @LarryJMcDonald White hate groups give Trump credit for the rise in their ranks. His incendiary xenophobic campaign rhetoric suits them just fine.
882069204362506240 2017-07-03 02:51:01 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump To beat N K you need to build coalitions and enact effective sanctions. Give Obama a call. He knows how.  He got Iran to the table.
882064699113652224 2017-07-03 02:33:06 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Yes the Media will keep reporting the truth. When will you do the same? Cant teach an old dog new trick, I guess.
882063776002060288 2017-07-03 02:29:26 UTC <michaelkaf> WE need to organize a demonstration in front of WH. We need to yell  "LOCK HIM UP!". That demo should grow louder every day. Until they do!
882062228983250944 2017-07-03 02:23:17 UTC <michaelkaf> @RBReich His term is not over yet. He may find his way to the bottom on both  counts. Especially since his policies are so ill defined.

881977581658148864 2017-07-03 20:46:56 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Did you ask him for reparations for 9/11?
881977355551551489 2017-07-03 20:46:02 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You have had so little to do with that. You actions will destroy our environment and weaken consumer protection, make rich even richer.

821058943464128517 2017-01-16 18:18:01 UTC <michaelkaf> When Donald said repeal and replace he had no idea what he was talking about. Another example of his thoughtless ignorance.

821055648439955457 2017-01-16 18:04:55 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump So far the change has been for the worse. You need walk the talk.  Preach and teach. Earn some dignity.

816339793017761792 2017-01-03 17:45:48 UTC <michaelkaf> When GOP repeals ACA the message that they dont care about the people will be loud and clear. Midterm elections r around the corner.

816337775465287681 2017-01-03 17:37:47 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Does losing by 3 mil votes translate to "winning big". Since when? watch your step! Courts will be busy.

813969836531388416 2016-12-27 04:48:26 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Does that count the  billion of free ads you got from the press. Lets compares lies instead.

813968661526487040 2016-12-27 04:43:46 UTC <michaelkaf> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump You keep putting your foot in your mouth. How very presidential?
813968374371909632 2016-12-27 04:42:37 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump So you think building settlements is a road to peace? Maybe start another war?

813967361103560704 2016-12-27 04:38:36 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Its not over until the fat lady sings. I'll be happy if you dont get us into a nuclear war!
813967043879956480 2016-12-27 04:37:20 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump You did not donate a nickle in eight years. Used funds for personal use. The court's not done with you.

809441058228682753 2016-12-15 16:52:41 UTC <michaelkaf> Trump as we know is not afraid to attack anyone. GOP, MEX, China, Boeing, etc. Why is he afraid of Putin. I smell a rat!
803075292625506304 2016-11-27 03:17:24 UTC <michaelkaf> Are you going to fuck us over like you do all your vendors?
803074801346682884 2016-11-27 03:15:27 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump Why are afraid of a recount??????????

801279269808832513 2016-11-22 04:20:39 UTC <michaelkaf> @chrislhayes Can u imagine if Obama or Clinton paid 25 mil to settle a fraud lawsuit. Yet the press almost ignored it. No big deal.
796391567414018048 2016-11-09 16:38:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @FuturisticHub If you want to create jobs revive the middle class. They are the engine of the economy. The consumers. Trickle up not down.
796390760753008650 2016-11-09 16:35:28 UTC <michaelkaf> @FuturisticHub Dont turn back the regs that protect the consumers. Dodd-Frank. CFPB. Show that you r for us not big biz.
796389943358550017 2016-11-09 16:32:13 UTC <michaelkaf> @FuturisticHub Global warming is not a hoax. Hope you said that only to get the crazies to vote for you.
796388762779533312 2016-11-09 16:27:31 UTC <michaelkaf> @mcuban We are stuck with him. My hope rests in the fact that he is a convenient liar. A chameleon. He  may change when confronted w/reality
796386296033853441 2016-11-09 16:17:43 UTC <michaelkaf> When Trump fails in keeping his promises. Bring jobs back. He will look for scapegoats. Look out minorities and foreigners.
796385453054115840 2016-11-09 16:14:22 UTC <michaelkaf> Trump will destroy the environment. He will reverse many of the protections Obama put in place to protect the consumer.
793498755731292160 2016-11-01 17:03:40 UTC <michaelkaf> @JohnStossel In China the coal pollution is so bad they wear masks to keep from getting sick. In Beijing you can cut the air with a knife.
793492186230771712 2016-11-01 16:37:34 UTC <michaelkaf> @JohnStossel You have totally understated the dangers of global warming. That danger is not in the future it is now.
793191308127076353 2016-10-31 20:41:59 UTC <michaelkaf> @realDonaldTrump I'd rather give a million to stop you.

792459990577668096 2016-10-29 20:15:59 UTC <michaelkaf> Trump lies like you and I breath. Every time he opens his mouth.
792459696103981060 2016-10-29 20:14:49 UTC <michaelkaf> Trump chose the GOP because he knew thats where he would find the crazies.
792459002902962180 2016-10-29 20:12:04 UTC <michaelkaf> Trump is decent like the Pope is indecent.https://twitter.com/TruthOuter/status/792458480451858432

792458221743136768 2016-10-29 20:08:57 UTC <michaelkaf> When Trump calls Weiner a major sleaze. That goes under the heading of " it takes one to know one."
792457780980543488 2016-10-29 20:07:12 UTC <michaelkaf> @TenaciousEye @smotus More than irresponsible. More like abuse of power. Dems need to scream louder. You know the GOP would.

792149899857031168 2016-10-28 23:43:48 UTC <michaelkaf> @doctorwho10156 You are worse than Putin.  American voters dont take him seriously, but you are regarded highly. Spit on you! TRAITOR!
792147355923537920 2016-10-28 23:33:41 UTC <michaelkaf> You have abused the power of your office. You should be ashamed of yourself. How can you sleep at night?

739593320549122048 2016-06-05 23:02:43 UTC <michaelkaf> @RBReich Reagan v BHO, Unless the recoveries happen simultaneously we have a false equivalency. GW left BHO with 2 wars, economy tanking.
739592227593162754 2016-06-05 22:58:22 UTC <michaelkaf> @RBReich u cant compare BHO recovery to Reagan: Reagan did not have to deal with tech revolution that eliminated millions of mid class jobs,
