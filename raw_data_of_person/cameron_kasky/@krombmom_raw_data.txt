962589327187259392 2018-02-10 07:29:14 UTC <krombmom> I fucking LOVE The Olympics...yes, even curling. Watching it with my kids makes it even better. Missing @Flamemmakins this year 
959452746222133248 2018-02-02 15:45:35 UTC <krombmom> I'm considering correcting everyone on Twitter who incorrectly uses "that" instead of "who". I'm pretty sure it would make me very popular.
953635031167131648 2018-01-17 14:28:03 UTC <krombmom> @nottheworstmom I also once left a note (and money), on a tooth-shaped paper, that I found a lost tooth on the school bus. That redeems me, right?
953633828362321920 2018-01-17 14:23:16 UTC <krombmom> @nottheworstmom I once left a note, on a tooth-shaped piece of paper, that my assistant dropped the ball...after an effing week of forgetting.

940462884156346368 2017-12-11 06:06:39 UTC <krombmom> @ACommonStarling Not as much as say, Game of Thrones, but...yes. Even better in the books 
940462262896140290 2017-12-11 06:04:11 UTC <krombmom> @ACommonStarling Looking for Poldark right now on my DVR search. Outlander books are so much better, but the series is nice as well. Join the dark side 
940460885536944129 2017-12-11 05:58:42 UTC <krombmom> @ACommonStarling Okay, I'll watch Poldark, eat tacos, drink beer (or wine) & "snuggle", if you watch (or read) the Outlander series...then we can discuss...

933172631087362048 2017-11-21 03:17:47 UTC <krombmom> @CDrems @Alphalari It's not always overt; sometimes it's passive-aggressive and sneaky. But, if someone consistently breaks you down...it's mental abuse.
933141345689939968 2017-11-21 01:13:28 UTC <krombmom> @LRGoodall2011 Well, then I think we're just meant to be friends!! Hooray!!!

836218582379933696 2017-02-27 14:17:00 UTC <krombmom> @SenSanders I'm sure that Trump's friends, who operate the very lucrative for-profit prisons in this country, will be thrilled and thankful.
