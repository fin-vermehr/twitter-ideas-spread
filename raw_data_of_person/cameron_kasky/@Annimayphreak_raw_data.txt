824751668407451648 2017-01-26 22:51:35 UTC <Annimayphreak> Create laws that save the environment AND HUMAN BEINGS. Not build a wall
824750760562929665 2017-01-26 22:47:59 UTC <Annimayphreak> Environmental justices will be heard. Women, the LGBTQIOA community and all concerned with issues will be equally represented
824750539464380416 2017-01-26 22:47:06 UTC <Annimayphreak> If we offer an multi-party system or open primaries we get a greater say in the choices out there.
824750423315726336 2017-01-26 22:46:38 UTC <Annimayphreak> Voting in primaries for example, Independents, Green, Libertarians etc.... cannot vote in closed primaries...
824750188740874240 2017-01-26 22:45:42 UTC <Annimayphreak> No party has its own issues....
824750135599099906 2017-01-26 22:45:30 UTC <Annimayphreak> No Party as in, you are watching a sports team fight and say both teams suck!
824750001691697152 2017-01-26 22:44:58 UTC <Annimayphreak> Identifying as NO PARTY allows to see the truths of each idea, after doing research. Real research and evaluating true sources.
824749761915936768 2017-01-26 22:44:01 UTC <Annimayphreak> The Green Party has some interesting ideas, Independents have some good ideas and sometimes Conservative party has some ideas too...
824749442708422656 2017-01-26 22:42:44 UTC <Annimayphreak> I say this because George Washington said party systems will be the end of our government. And the 2016 election proved that.
824749166316441601 2017-01-26 22:41:39 UTC <Annimayphreak> In the real world beyond that piece of paper, I identify as a progressive independent.
824749046741008393 2017-01-26 22:41:10 UTC <Annimayphreak> To the state I reside in, on a flimsy piece of paper and stored on a piece of technology, I am a Democratic.
824748802582179840 2017-01-26 22:40:12 UTC <Annimayphreak> I am an independent because I am angry with the Democratic Party as much as the Republican Party.
824748707476340736 2017-01-26 22:39:49 UTC <Annimayphreak> I'm a progressive independent who likes Democrats. Why do you ask?
824654285241745408 2017-01-26 16:24:37 UTC <Annimayphreak> Sooo tired
