902130212841902081 2017-08-28 11:26:18 UTC <juliet_wilde> Noone noticed I didn't come out of the water with him. And it was the most vivid dream. And then I was dead but still seeing what was going.
902129958860021760 2017-08-28 11:25:17 UTC <juliet_wilde> Just dreamt that my boyfriend's cousin drowned me, and I used my last breaths to produce bubbles in hopes that someone was watching.

898186038878908416 2017-08-17 14:13:33 UTC <juliet_wilde> He's talking to me about, explaining the flavors, etc... As if I've never had yogurt with granola.
898185730522046465 2017-08-17 14:12:20 UTC <juliet_wilde> Now he's asking how long it goes in the oven.
898185658090610688 2017-08-17 14:12:03 UTC <juliet_wilde> Boyfriend wants me to "make him one"... Just added granola. I said "no, make it yourself" and he sighed with exasperation.pic.twitter.com/XQAwDmRpR9
