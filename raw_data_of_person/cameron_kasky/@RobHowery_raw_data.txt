958535739108544514 2018-01-30 03:01:43 UTC <RobHowery> @Shaq48_Trading Screw politics
912022130794962946 2017-09-24 18:33:15 UTC <RobHowery> How the same?Gov official using influence calling for firing of private citizen is illegal. You don't expect some level of class from POTUS?
911980853915410432 2017-09-24 15:49:14 UTC <RobHowery> @Shaq48_Trading Is it too much to ask that our President not call out people as SOBs and demand their firing for peaceful protest?
899484215552516097 2017-08-20 04:12:03 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel Enough bullshit.  Maybe just a bored angry dude, nothing that interesting. Let's face it, twitter politics is a waste.  Got baited again.
899462337148592129 2017-08-20 02:45:07 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel I tend to agree Mike but I didn't I didn't see anything from you about the white supremacists in Charlottesville.  Why not?
897269688568172544 2017-08-14 01:32:18 UTC <RobHowery> @seanmdav Is he wrong?
896197643084353537 2017-08-11 02:32:23 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel what kills me is the incompetence of this admin. Finally a chance to do things but Trump can't get out of his own way.
896194022850437120 2017-08-11 02:18:00 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel ok that makes sense
894937985367523328 2017-08-08 15:06:57 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel Everyone in WH leaks, incl Trump.  It's about which leaks they like/don't like.  Am I wrong?
893324540029186048 2017-08-03 04:15:42 UTC <RobHowery> @josh_hammer maybe, but tell me how it is wrong
893322229760499712 2017-08-03 04:06:31 UTC <RobHowery> @matthewbrennan1 @marketmodel You read the transcripts? Very troubling they were leaked (Trump insider?)but man he sounds like an idiot
893319066861027328 2017-08-03 03:53:57 UTC <RobHowery> @matthewbrennan1 @marketmodel Cmon man, not the only one
893309961656180737 2017-08-03 03:17:46 UTC <RobHowery> @matthewbrennan1 @marketmodel re: agenda cannot dispute that...i am supportive of much of it.  My issue is incompetence...
893308907770175491 2017-08-03 03:13:35 UTC <RobHowery> @matthewbrennan1 @marketmodel who we talking re: "staff"?  Does he not have ability to fire/replace them?
893297210976124928 2017-08-03 02:27:06 UTC <RobHowery> @matthewbrennan1 @marketmodel His advisors are Obama holdovers?
893294415187329024 2017-08-03 02:15:59 UTC <RobHowery> @matthewbrennan1 @marketmodel Many of these leaks are coming FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

847634396521742336 2017-03-30 02:19:23 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel who is your enemy?
846919607151542272 2017-03-28 02:59:04 UTC <RobHowery> @realDonaldTrump @BakkenShale it's a comedy sketch...but ok

842586559543050241 2017-03-16 04:01:04 UTC <RobHowery> @sspencer_smb I needed a good laugh
840038972411789312 2017-03-09 03:17:52 UTC <RobHowery> @alfranken you are good people Al
836063202635055105 2017-02-26 03:59:35 UTC <RobHowery> @PatrickWalker56 Thanks Patrick, you do the same!
836056904673656837 2017-02-26 03:34:33 UTC <RobHowery> @PatrickWalker56 Fair enough...I didn't see the last 15min so was curious. Agreed on 1st amendment!  Interesting times we live in. Cheers
836053824569815040 2017-02-26 03:22:19 UTC <RobHowery> @PatrickWalker56 What was said that you object to?
835702368712933376 2017-02-25 04:05:45 UTC <RobHowery> @itvnews Wow, our President is not half the man this guy is.
831722049278210048 2017-02-14 04:29:23 UTC <RobHowery> @washingtonpost @nytimes @SI_PeterKing Amen
827365789669920768 2017-02-02 03:59:10 UTC <RobHowery> Thx for all the charts you share. This one broke the 200MA(good tech signal) do you incorporate FA also?
814609941969379328 2016-12-29 23:11:59 UTC <RobHowery> @foleyloaded93 @AndySwan agreed, partisanship is out of control all around...but it has been taken to a new level.  Kudos
814606924343898112 2016-12-29 23:00:00 UTC <RobHowery> @ReformedBroker @AndySwan @foleyloaded93 the same "many people" who would reject that proof anyway
814602062466056193 2016-12-29 22:40:40 UTC <RobHowery> @ReformedBroker @AndySwan @foleyloaded93 who is "we"? pardon me for suspecting you would not accept any proof and call it fake news
814595542030360576 2016-12-29 22:14:46 UTC <RobHowery> @ReformedBroker @foleyloaded93 @AndySwan Russian espionage influenced the election.  A real knee slapper.
814595187150356481 2016-12-29 22:13:21 UTC <RobHowery> @ReformedBroker @AndySwan if you have to be told,nothing will sway you anyway
814273904931930113 2016-12-28 00:56:42 UTC <RobHowery> @KurtSchlichter what happened to #americafirst?  It's all about Israel?  you are actually a liberal, just way dumber
814273297605074944 2016-12-28 00:54:17 UTC <RobHowery> @KurtSchlichter I see, you identify as a downtrodden minority, who deserves special treatment. What happened to #AmericaFirst ?
813592343714598912 2016-12-26 03:48:25 UTC <RobHowery> @realDonaldTrump it bought portraits of trump
813587355852537856 2016-12-26 03:28:36 UTC <RobHowery> @andlav @ThomasBuckBush2 I accept him cause I'm perfect.  Like you...NOT
813582931616825344 2016-12-26 03:11:01 UTC <RobHowery> @realDonaldTrump @JonBershad @TrumpIsTheBoss3 since you can't think for yourself

813182992956981250 2016-12-25 00:41:48 UTC <RobHowery> @AlbertBreer god I love tweets with zero context

812509531095842816 2016-12-23 04:05:42 UTC <RobHowery> @realDonaldTrump @BrandanJR @Harrell0331 Thanks for the reasoned response.  That is true, trying to keep an open mind but WTF?
812496866248196096 2016-12-23 03:15:23 UTC <RobHowery> @realDonaldTrump @BrandanJR @Harrell0331 if obama had EVER said anything like this how would you react?  Pls be honest
812495762923851777 2016-12-23 03:10:59 UTC <RobHowery> @realDonaldTrump @BrandanJR @Harrell0331 traitor
811417070139215872 2016-12-20 03:44:39 UTC <RobHowery> @gbosch11679 "And It's Gerard". That was precious.
811416633319231488 2016-12-20 03:42:55 UTC <RobHowery> @RepublicanChick Poor woman shills endlessly for Trump and people like you hate her because she's not white...
811244003995910144 2016-12-20 16:16:57 UTC <RobHowery> @gbosch11679 easy there Gerald...gonna send the address of your Mom's basement?Just kidding man, merry Christmas, sincerely
811075812552278017 2016-12-19 05:08:37 UTC <RobHowery> @LMT978 @MEKhoko @STKMTN82 Doubt he is claiming 100:1 R/R.Just has potential to b 1 of big winners needed to offset the (much)smaller losses
811059484349046784 2016-12-19 04:03:44 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel Sorry, just remembered this. Curious your thoughts now that much of his agenda is now revealed. Not trolling, actually curious.
810676025306861569 2016-12-18 02:40:00 UTC <RobHowery> @gbosch11679 said the twitter tough guy 
810646043016708096 2016-12-18 00:40:52 UTC <RobHowery> @stphnmaher @SteveRattner @michaelcrowel15 Pack your bags
810272250385616896 2016-12-17 23:55:33 UTC <RobHowery> @RepublicanChick @JasonA_youtube @UberGuber This is how a fellow Trump supporter treats you?
809242306356379648 2016-12-14 03:42:55 UTC <RobHowery> @MikeKlis that makes no sense
804161101306982401 2016-11-30 03:12:01 UTC <RobHowery> @alsabogal @LMT978 Agreed, any jobs we can keep are important.Real issue though IMO is automation,not jobs moving elsewhere.Need retraining.
797557197488189440 2016-11-12 21:50:28 UTC <RobHowery> @PrisonPlanet HRC comparisons are BS.  She lost and for good reason.  Pretending he's a saint makes you look silly.
797548132435378176 2016-11-12 21:14:27 UTC <RobHowery> @YouTube @marketmodel awesome
796421627198271488 2016-11-09 18:38:07 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel Don't get me wrong, I am hopeful...but does he seem like someone who is devoid of self interest and questionable motives?
796406973164113920 2016-11-09 17:39:53 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel We really have no idea what Trump is actually going to do
789614345160306688 2016-10-21 23:48:24 UTC <RobHowery> @JosephBXTrader @marketmodel But the side that wants to cut taxes has f'd it up so badly they have almost no chance. Really pisses me off.
785323460947906561 2016-10-09 03:37:58 UTC <RobHowery> @Shaq48_Trading and I do as well...who said anyone needs a politician to instill values?  that would be a first . Have a good night.
785318264452763648 2016-10-09 03:17:19 UTC <RobHowery> @Shaq48_Trading absolutely, I would love having a non politician as president but not this guy...makes my skin crawl
785316983759785988 2016-10-09 03:12:14 UTC <RobHowery> @Shaq48_Trading not really, but I guess a lot of people fell backed into a corner.  I can't do it...my daughters deserve better
785314478967488512 2016-10-09 03:02:16 UTC <RobHowery> @Shaq48_Trading I agree, but how can you justify supporting trump?
785311135243186176 2016-10-09 02:48:59 UTC <RobHowery> @RobInTheBlack I get the dislike of Hillary but how can you support this guy?
785302540782936065 2016-10-09 02:14:50 UTC <RobHowery> @RobInTheBlack you have to admit he's pretty entertaining
785302138972844034 2016-10-09 02:13:14 UTC <RobHowery> @stt2318 word
784589674853662720 2016-10-07 03:02:10 UTC <RobHowery> @NMamatas @GOODGREED yeah that will happen
780604013553209344 2016-09-26 03:04:34 UTC <RobHowery> @BreakingOutBad @RedDogT3 nobody is taking away the second amendment. You can have your precious assault weapons
768092665548189696 2016-08-23 14:28:56 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel Mike, thanks for all you share.  Can you suggest any reading material on scaling strategies?
761760157336416256 2016-08-05 03:05:48 UTC <RobHowery> @marketmodel Mike, any suggestions on reading material about scaling strategies?
759588209349136384 2016-07-30 03:15:16 UTC <RobHowery> @realDonaldTrump tiny orange hands
759577825791709184 2016-07-30 02:34:00 UTC <RobHowery> @LMTentarelli what is your momentum filter if you don't mind me asking?
746315651204120576 2016-06-24 12:14:51 UTC <RobHowery> @LMTentarelli much respect for the honesty...most on twitter would not admit in 100 yrs...lol
742388373663318019 2016-06-13 16:09:15 UTC <RobHowery> @LMTentarelli Thanks so much, appreciate you taking the time to respond.
742128089111498752 2016-06-12 22:54:59 UTC <RobHowery> @LMTentarelli Is your trigger a simple break of the 200 day MA, or do you have other rules as well?
