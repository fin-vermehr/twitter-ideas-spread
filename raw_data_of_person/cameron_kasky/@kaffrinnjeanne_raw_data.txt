971893379125710849 2018-03-08 23:40:13 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> @RichCumpston Haha youre welcome! Its a good one. Highly recommend if youre looking to feel young and a little angsty. 
971836000803704832 2018-03-08 19:52:13 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> Listening to MySpace: The Ultimate Playlist on Spotify is wild because its making me feel like an awkward teen again when in fact I am actually an awkward adult now
971736654531715072 2018-03-08 13:17:27 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> @vpanucc Thank you! I sent out another push to professors yesterday to share with their classes, and its working (slowly, but still!). I swear I will take every survey that comes across my newsfeed/email after this process, haha
971456364991139841 2018-03-07 18:43:40 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> @courtneypapaj You have no idea how much I appreciate this! My study looks at undergrads and social media engagement, though, so unfortunately, I need undergrad students to take it 
971429683572113411 2018-03-07 16:57:39 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> @TomazBoeck Im not sure what the MBA capstone is like! Im in ComLead 
971417532224671744 2018-03-07 16:09:22 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> Attempting to get responses to my capstone survey & sitting here like, is it me? Did I say the wrong thing? Should I reach out again? Can they just say, NO, bc that would be less agonizing than waiting for a response?? makes me realize I havent been ghosted in a while 
968865875867717638 2018-02-28 15:10:00 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> saw the name Thomas OMalley in a directory at work so naturally Ive been humming The Aristocats music all morning like the normal adult I am
965611064577724418 2018-02-19 15:36:32 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> @_mama_dubs I really didnt want to pay for it at first, but it was worth it! I think youll like it. I joined because I gained like 15lbs last year & no longer fit comfortably in a bridesmaid dress & figured losing weight would make me feel better than paying for alterations 
965607527932219392 2018-02-19 15:22:29 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> @_mama_dubs Have you looked into Weight Watchers? If you just do the app & not the meetings, its not as expensive! Im doing it now & its super user friendly & it works. Ive lost almost 10 in a month and Im a horrible cook/bad at consistently going to the gym

709553144087183361 2016-03-14 01:33:47 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> Whenever I make a cynical comment during The Bachelor, my friends say, "hashtag Truth Bomb Trautwein"

699806043413413888 2016-02-16 04:02:17 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> Meredith and I have been FB friends for 5 years, & FB INSISTS that I share a pic of two old men at McDonald's to commemorate this milestone.
698334560019484672 2016-02-12 02:35:08 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> GUYS a cute boy stopped and asked if I needed help and I said no bc Criminal Minds taught me to say no to strangers offering help ugh

698013679942549504 2016-02-11 05:20:04 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> Expectation: Be asleep by midnight. Reality: Eating Corn Pops and watching really old Jonas Brothers youtube videos.
697603489485160452 2016-02-10 02:10:07 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> Cat was asleep. I watched a video, and when Trump appeared in the video and started talking, the cat randomly woke up and smacked me...
697528688167022592 2016-02-10 21:12:53 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> There are few things I hate more than radio DJs who talk/sing over the end of songs.

696532843183345664 2016-02-07 03:15:45 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> Someone could give me a free ticket to the Super Bowl and I'd probably be like, "idk, does this ticket include all the snacks?"

694721840930017282 2016-02-02 03:19:28 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> This night quickly went from "be productive" to "have a few beers and play darts with @tinezcruz & @lillis_michael" and I'm okay with it

693977916456181761 2016-01-31 02:03:23 UTC <kaffrinnjeanne> The Rydell HS dance gets Joe Jonas live. My HS dances were just a bunch of sweaty teens grinding to "Temperature" by Sean Paul in the dark
