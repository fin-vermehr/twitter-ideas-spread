971781719983443968 2018-03-08 16:16:31 UTC <howtoheretic> @MrBeecher @tgiatheist @Nathandertal Sadly yes. I'm typing this by feel because I drilled my eyes out with a 3/4" paddle bit.
971771114819960833 2018-03-08 15:34:23 UTC <howtoheretic> Thanks @AndrewLSeidel and @patorrezlaw - Friends, please share this with anyone who may be participating in the #marchForOurLives protests on March 24th.https://twitter.com/AndrewLSeidel/status/971756153876000769
971627718063276032 2018-03-07 06:04:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @godless_mom Dazzle camouflage! It's brilliant and weird, but oddly enough it was fairly effective.
971616109110509568 2018-03-07 05:18:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @the_moonshadow The difference is watching the nightmarish car crash videos didn't make any of us orgasm.
971609558157213697 2018-03-07 04:52:24 UTC <howtoheretic> Thanks @the_moonshadow - please share far and wide. The pushback against the #MarchForOurLives protestors is going to be big. The NRA is a terrorizing minority, please support the sensible majority represented by these incredible young people.https://twitter.com/the_moonshadow/status/971608651801726976
971605435345076226 2018-03-07 04:36:01 UTC <howtoheretic> @ACLU Yes @patorrezlaw & @aclu exactly right! Hey @AndrewLSeidel I want to help support and protect the #MarchForOurLives kids here in Utah and elsewhere. Is there a place where legal info for marchers and those who wish to support them can go for info and fundraising?https://twitter.com/patorrezlaw/status/971604015103594496
971603766846763008 2018-03-07 04:29:24 UTC <howtoheretic> @ACLU @patorrezlaw Absolutely! I'm all ears! Maybe we start with helping HS kids understand what rights to free speech and protest they have, what the worst case legal scenarios are, and how allies can best support and fund their efforts?
971603166004264960 2018-03-07 04:27:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose I suggest their encouragement is unimportant. It's ok you school wants to foster a dialogue but the energy behind this movement seems to be a lack of concern for the failed processes of the older generation's discourse. I think they're on their heels.
971601689349300224 2018-03-07 04:21:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Hmmm. Thats better than threatening kids with suspension/expulsion for walking out I guess? Whats your sense of it? Is a walkout in your Ohio school in motion?
971599596890636288 2018-03-07 04:12:50 UTC <howtoheretic> @cameron_kasky Thank YOU Cameron! Some of the generations before you are determined not to make this fight just yours. Sorry for what you suffered, thank you for your courage and wit, and know you are in the vast majority of this country.
971592399515394049 2018-03-07 03:44:14 UTC <howtoheretic> I'm so impressed by @ToriGlass being totally neutral here and not putting here west coast presumption-thumb on the scale! Ex-Mormon opinion-haver Out!
971588685895315456 2018-03-07 03:29:28 UTC <howtoheretic> To the right & their captive media, Hillary is their Biblical devil- they hate her but they're totally defined by her. They despise her but without her they have no animating purpose. Without her they're just fat old white guys jealous of more successful fat old white guys.https://twitter.com/chris_labarthe/status/971584569462816770
971587372407169024 2018-03-07 03:24:15 UTC <howtoheretic> Hey is there an org in place for legal defense/costs of the young people who walk out/march on the #MarchForOurLives protests state by state on March 24th? I'm in Utah and can help provide a platform etc. @patorrezlaw @ACLU happy for advice.https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/971586039000260608
971582491944402946 2018-03-07 03:04:51 UTC <howtoheretic> @openargs recorded an emergency episode about the Stormy Daniels developments. You won't believe this, but it could be that Trump and his brain trust have gotten tangled up in their wee little dicks yet again! Crazy, right?https://openargs.com/oa154-stormy-daniels-is-a-legal-genius/
971577928310865921 2018-03-07 02:46:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @hemantmehta The original title was "All combined, I've had more marriage$ and divorce$ than I have teeth, and I have (almo$t) all my teeth- The trial and crucifixion of a Biblical literali$t & ravenou$ media whore and a total failure of a county employee- Kim Davi$" It was edited for length.
971565718016638979 2018-03-07 01:58:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @JuliusGoat It's maddening- It's the David Brooks-ization of any non Centrist Country Club approved thought. 'I guess it's a bummer you covered your head with a science text book while you waited to die, but is making me slightly uncomfortable the real answer, kiddos? Grow up'
971521924948897792 2018-03-07 23:04:11 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname Thanks Nyck!
971521247023579136 2018-03-07 23:01:29 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname Hahahaha!
971521187057553408 2018-03-07 23:01:15 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname Is that true? What was his name, I'd like to read up on it.
971450711685857280 2018-03-07 18:21:13 UTC <howtoheretic> @hemantmehta Well, ya know what the Good Book says, one door opens and causes a catastrophic decompression and structural disintegration killing everyone on board and littering the country-side with bloody hair hunks and aircraft debris- or something.
971448806406541313 2018-03-07 18:13:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop @ToriGlass GO FIGHT WIN!!!!!!!!
971448678228660224 2018-03-07 18:13:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @realDonaldTrump @Smartiecats Yeah, people like Chachi, the Mooch, the Nuge, and John Barron. Only the best.
971445352611098624 2018-03-07 17:59:55 UTC <howtoheretic> @RandyLaMonda Good question Randy- I think the great Jeremy Runnells addresses this in his amazing CES letter. If you haven't read it, you can find it here: https://cesletter.org/
971443165776539648 2018-03-07 17:51:13 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass @C_Stroop Hahahahaha! Tori, that means you gotta win the Homecoming game and earn that varsity letter!
971442402216079372 2018-03-07 17:48:11 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass @C_Stroop The thought of you two on the Ferris Wheel, poodle skirt, letterman's jacket, saddle shoes and bobby socks, sharing a cotton candy- ugh it's just too adorable!!!!!
971440639027052544 2018-03-07 17:41:11 UTC <howtoheretic> @JesseHoffner Just not quite as nice as Chris ;)
971440541627027456 2018-03-07 17:40:48 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop @ToriGlass OMG tell me you two went on the Ferris Wheel????
971439827655815171 2018-03-07 17:37:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop @ToriGlass He is a peach, isn't he?
971439730717069313 2018-03-07 17:37:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @JesseHoffner I saw his #emptythepews hashtag and advocacy here on Twitter and reached out to him. He's doing the same kind of work we are generally, only he's super nice about it ;)

971211799965003781 2018-03-06 02:31:52 UTC <howtoheretic> @hemantmehta It's a really tough fabric to work with tho- very tough to get the seams just perfect, reveals every imperfection- I would take god's help if she's offering.
971204000598011904 2018-03-06 02:00:52 UTC <howtoheretic> @StephenAtHome As his youngest daughter, he obviously stands by Tariff's decision to decline his nomination for Secretary of Bottle Service. He's an adoring father first, very stable genius 3rd.
971171022866022400 2018-03-06 23:49:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Agreed. Dan sprung it on me and I was reeling, unprepared, in a maelstrom of pain and confusion. I'll never be the same.
970837021743722496 2018-03-05 01:42:37 UTC <howtoheretic> And ya know, construction workers, police men, soldiers, cowboys, cool guys in motorcycle gangs. The kind of people you meet in any village.

970804660264054784 2018-03-05 23:34:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @amandablount2 It's, peculiar. He's calling in and then huffing and yelling at the stunned reporters like they issued the subpoena- I just can't make sense of it.
970795217711280128 2018-03-05 22:56:31 UTC <howtoheretic> @Keithtimber Thanks Kieth. She was without equal.

970134309863436288 2018-03-03 03:10:18 UTC <howtoheretic> @GOP @amandablount2 Sure thats crazy. BUT let's insist before he's President for Life he tries to be president for 6 straight hours without TV or 'executive time'. He won't be able to President all the way to lunch.

969823983045496832 2018-03-02 06:37:10 UTC <howtoheretic> @Lead1225 @Floridaline @interbaza13 Yes stupidity is deadly. I'm always willing to help religious people come to grips with the holy books they've never actually read. Sigh.
969823027775946752 2018-03-02 06:33:22 UTC <howtoheretic> @Lead1225 @Floridaline @interbaza13 Ah! No idea what that means but if it means antagonizing this wackadoo Christian selective reader, I approve. I'm standing by to help her understand the moral shit-whirlpool of the Old Testament.
969821725855596544 2018-03-02 06:28:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @Lead1225 @Floridaline @interbaza13 So, what is steffococci?
969820900487962624 2018-03-02 06:24:55 UTC <howtoheretic> @Floridaline @interbaza13 Indeed. @Lead1225 's demand an opinion about the ghastly horrors of the OT can only be criticized by someone having been there is - hilarious.
969820195014328320 2018-03-02 06:22:07 UTC <howtoheretic> @Floridaline @interbaza13 Yes. What?

969819371320238080 2018-03-02 06:18:51 UTC <howtoheretic> @Floridaline @interbaza13 Some Xian was demanding of @Flrodaline that if they weren't present in the centuries BC that the Old Testament was 'written' they have no right to have an opinion about the Old Testament. I am inclined to disagree with that idiotic statement. Feel me?
969817222607597569 2018-03-02 06:10:18 UTC <howtoheretic> @interbaza13 @Floridaline Err, so you weren't there, but SJ was? I'm here for any sanctimonious Christian selective reader that wants to pretend the OT has anything remotely representing morality in it. It's a rewarding 30 seconds of a finite life.

969430803892486144 2018-03-01 04:34:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @Tanner_M_Barker I'll check it out. We did a fairly in depth segment about Jonestown/Jim Jones in an earlier episode. It was one of the first news stories in can recall in life. Pretty intense for a young kid.

BUT if you offer him $50 to deny that Joseph Smith was a prophet of god he'll impale himself on a microphone to do it and give you $40 back. He's the truck-stop hand-job of the senate.
969415008080707584 2018-03-01 03:32:03 UTC <howtoheretic> Hey all. Utahn here- @OrrinHatch is what you call a prostitute, but an amoral one.

968504429019197440 2018-02-27 15:13:44 UTC <howtoheretic> @MrMMarsh @HRKenny Yeah- I was being facetious about 'international bankers'. Most Mormon conspiracy theories spring from their own highly peculiar beliefs. This guy is outside even the Mormon conspiratorial 'main stream'.
968503231625113601 2018-02-27 15:08:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny @MrMMarsh Yes, bizarre. I wonder what he could have meant by 'international bankers', hmmmm? Also, did you catch that he's a Mormon to boot? Because, sure why not?

He is sure no atheist has read the shit-pile called the Bible. Let him demonstrate he has. He is off to a catastrophic start saying the 'chapter' Leviticus doesn't forbid anything when it is the most forbiddy book of the Bible. Give him room to show off.
967615026981896192 2018-02-24 04:19:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @ThinkAtheist @WaywardWillis @bitcoin_savage Also bruv, while accusing me of never having read Leviticus you said this- "Leviticus never had anything forbidden in it" - Making me pretty sure you've never read that book (not chapter, as you said). Forbidding shit is Leviticus' whole thing, guy.

967609687972618241 2018-02-24 03:58:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @ThinkAtheist @WaywardWillis @bitcoin_savage Oh hey no punctuation pretend money guy! First, my Leviticus thing was a joke- human people do that. Secondly, you bet my community/family/church 'taught' me the Bible all day every day! Wow what a wonderful youth it was. Read it sometime, it SUCKS (sorry for all the punctuation)
967604167786217473 2018-02-24 03:36:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @bitcoin_savage @ThinkAtheist @WaywardWillis Oooooh! Well you've come to the right place friends!pic.twitter.com/Jc1jEBwvRa
967602151248637953 2018-02-24 03:28:24 UTC <howtoheretic> @bitcoin_savage @ThinkAtheist @WaywardWillis And here we see both the first ALL CAPS run-on screed, but also the first evidence of the refusal to employ the Oxford comma-pic.twitter.com/EUXEgwN2te
967600250599784449 2018-02-24 03:20:51 UTC <howtoheretic> @bitcoin_savage @ThinkAtheist @WaywardWillis Ah yes, I see. It's explained in Deuteronomy.

967596384516947969 2018-02-24 03:05:29 UTC <howtoheretic> @kevandbenedict Best Paul Thomas Anderson movie about the the fatal allure of soy 'meat' substitutes ever.
967593495333560322 2018-02-24 02:54:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass And I know it's a tiny thing- but there was this time a Christian identity racist ideology took up arms agains the US govt. It was called the Civil War. Spoiler, it ended pretty badly for the pro-sedition side. They could probably Google it.
967592778954768384 2018-02-24 02:51:10 UTC <howtoheretic> @Womenwthoutrlgn @Justagu62278802 So, is this you owning me? I feel like your comeback is taking too much research. Wanna talk in DM's about your issues? My DMs are open.
967592071992246272 2018-02-24 02:48:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass C'mon Tori, the only 'people' that factor into his equation are white men. You know that even if he was cognizant of slavery/Japanese internment/native relocation (which his definitely is not) he would be fine with all that.
967587815155384320 2018-02-24 02:31:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @bitcoin_savage @ThinkAtheist @WaywardWillis Are punctuation, capitalization and coherence forbidden in Leviticus? Or has Franklin Graham made a 1st gen screaming Jesus-bot that needs more R&D?
967586147424587776 2018-02-24 02:24:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @kevandbenedict Farts. There will be farts.

967461909581590528 2018-02-24 18:11:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop You know how slippery that slope is- yeah there is literally no way to prevent this from getting overtly sexual from jump. Proceed with caution.
967460939162243072 2018-02-24 18:07:17 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop It's you sin I'm sorry for 
967460276730699776 2018-02-24 18:04:39 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics I stand corrected. @C_Stroop has a filthy (writing for) Playboy habit. Let's all pray for him and wish him the best! Apologies Chris!
967458095378006017 2018-02-24 17:55:59 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics- riding the high off his first pastorly article in Playboy, the very silly Christopher Stroop has started some duck/hymn tom-foolery.

Pissed off, playing the victim? Just a couple friends and all of them racists? It's a pretty boilerplate profile. Tell me I'm right!
967271642358427648 2018-02-23 05:35:05 UTC <howtoheretic> @cmclymer Honestly, this kid should be writing for @StephenAtHome starting yesterday.
967264805647106048 2018-02-23 05:07:55 UTC <howtoheretic> @Womenwthoutrlgn @Justagu62278802 Not to tell you your business Justagu62278802, but this is usually when Christians witness to me. Or was I mistaken and your god was a different one? I mean, so many to choose from, right? Which is it (them)?
967257829017923585 2018-02-23 04:40:11 UTC <howtoheretic> @Womenwthoutrlgn @Justagu62278802 Ha! Sick burn kiddo! You're doing great! Hey I notice of your 5 followers, two have exactly the same bio (mom! Quit embarrassing him!) and the other 4 are white nationalists. I haven't heard you say the name of the god you're going on about, but you sure seem like a Christian.
967255572910194688 2018-02-23 04:31:13 UTC <howtoheretic> @Womenwthoutrlgn @Justagu62278802 Hey kid, remember when the Dr gave you an injection that prevented a nightmarish death and you didn't cry? And he gave you some pills to take everyday? Can you take a picture of them and send it to me? I'll cross check with the PDR (boring science stuff) to make sure you're ok.
967253639420035072 2018-02-23 04:23:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop @babytoolkit Right?
967250508665597952 2018-02-23 04:11:06 UTC <howtoheretic> @Womenwthoutrlgn @Justagu62278802 Oh hey kid! If you're in trouble I can muster all the resources and remedies science and learning can provide to preserve and extend your life. You don't have to believe they're real, but thats ok smart people do, and they're available to you as well. But first put mommy on.
967249710368014336 2018-02-23 04:07:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @Womenwthoutrlgn @Justagu62278802 Justagu? Kiddo are you ok? Do I need to have my lovely Heretics try to sleuth out the basement you're asphyxiating in? Are you too young to know your address? Can you see anything outside your parent's window to describe to me?

967241203526742016 2018-02-23 03:34:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop Thanks for the excellent article Chris! His coming hagiography needs tempering with reality. You did just that.
967240921610776579 2018-02-23 03:33:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Fook! So sorry- what is it?

Call the gas Co and have them come check the appliances. Then put your mom on so we can ask if you're taking you meds and if she knows about your internet habits. Atheists, we care. Seriously.

966930590351044609 2018-02-22 06:59:52 UTC <howtoheretic> @lafantome @Its_John_Doe_ Ok man. Lets talk tomorrow. Last thought tonight- you made an extraordinary claim that a credible victim is a fraud. That is a hateful proposition. Make sure that is the person you want to be. I dont believe in hell, your bio makes me think you do. Rest well.
966928035562704896 2018-02-22 06:49:42 UTC <howtoheretic> @lafantome @Its_John_Doe_ John it's late where I am- gotta sign off. Person to person I find your attack on one of these kids abhorrent. However I'm down to understand the reasoning that lead you here. Can we connect tomorrow on twitter? Also I'm in US mountain time, can we meet and talk?
966925924783370242 2018-02-22 06:41:19 UTC <howtoheretic> @lafantome @Its_John_Doe_ John, what are you insinuating.

966924591275786241 2018-02-22 06:36:01 UTC <howtoheretic> @lafantome @Its_John_Doe_ Gotta keep it on Bible guy, Doctor's orders. Now help me understand how a minor who survived a massacre and has the audacity to have an opinion about it is being paid on like Rubio levels of gun industry payments? & show receipts.
966923441646419968 2018-02-22 06:31:27 UTC <howtoheretic> @lafantome Same. Pity is saved for the lowest.
966920666615136256 2018-02-22 06:20:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @lafantome @Its_John_Doe_ If your sad life is built on shitty myths & provable lies & you act only for compensation, everything you do is in bad faith. Broken people like that can't comprehend empathy and altruism. John_Doe is too self-mutilated and stunted to understand acting selflessly. Pity him.
966904814230683649 2018-02-22 05:17:26 UTC <howtoheretic> In this picture, I see @marcorubio trying to calculate how much @NRA sponsored, murdered student blood money he'll need to make i to retirement.

966849194739806208 2018-02-22 01:36:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @Brasilmagic And the hate tweeting!
966844508355813376 2018-02-22 01:17:48 UTC <howtoheretic> @Brasilmagic Plus I think yesterday was indicative of the way he makes so many decisions- He'll say anything to get out of the room and get back to his TV. So he says whatever he thinks the people in the room want to hear & leaves. He has no beliefs or knowledge of the subject, he wants out.
966839778086813696 2018-02-22 00:59:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @djrothkopf No
966822941563342848 2018-02-22 23:52:06 UTC <howtoheretic> @WaywardWillis Ummm, yeah. It's sooo sexy.
966822184353021952 2018-02-22 23:49:06 UTC <howtoheretic> @WaywardWillis There's a fair amount of paper work and then getting really wet for a minute before you get your polyester demon-proof armor, sorry to say.
966819580160065537 2018-02-22 23:38:45 UTC <howtoheretic> @WaywardWillis I can arrange for that. If you'll just send me your address I can have a couple magi-panted young men there is about 15 minutes to help get you all set up for a pair.

966816373413502979 2018-02-22 23:26:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @WaywardWillis I can do one better. I'm constantly hear from Mormons that as gay man I'm trying to proselytize and push an agenda- from members of a church that has 80k missionaries knocking on the doors of the world to push their agenda.

966753349323272192 2018-02-22 19:15:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @Smartiecats Generational in mine as well. But it still boggles the mind that people would so handicap their own children. There ought to be a law....

966750948943998976 2018-02-22 19:06:02 UTC <howtoheretic> Same here, but from hardcore Mormonism. I left home with the life skills of a six year old and hobbled by terror of a world I had been deliberately forced to misunderstand. 40 years later I'm still baffled by this intentional mutilation of a normal child.https://twitter.com/anaisbelieve/status/966748773136220160
966750068589015040 2018-02-22 19:02:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @probablyforsale And, he LOVED gay people. I mean, in the way you love a person so much you're glad a fatal disease that seems to specifically target their population comes along and wipes them out by the 10's of thousands kinda love.

966487061690687489 2018-02-21 01:37:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass HAHAHA! They have to polled anonymously to be honest? Nice movement y'all have there guys.
966483270819921920 2018-02-21 01:22:22 UTC <howtoheretic> @pattonoswalt @putnamca Hmmm, a person this disordered and hateful seems to still pose a danger to himself and others- Parole is a privilege reserved for being a model citizen in exchange for the public's trust. Dinesh's venomous behavior seems a violation of this trust.
966480718388871169 2018-02-21 01:12:14 UTC <howtoheretic> @AndrewLSeidel It also shows his reckless laziness. He refused to spend 5 minutes preparing for what could be a political disaster if he mishandled the moment in any way. He's sloppy, disinterested and bored.
966479806857494528 2018-02-21 01:08:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @pattonoswalt Badgering, threatening and mocking victims of violent crimes must be a parole violation for convicted felon Dinesh, no? Plus all the lying? Anybody know who his parole officer is? I'll forward his tweets.

966361175557472256 2018-02-21 17:17:13 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop Also worth noting, apparently Graham loving evangelicals believe either that Russia has rivers and/or in the easter philosophy of Karmic justice. Shocking if true, in either case.

966195633626460161 2018-02-20 06:19:24 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad Imperial Roman occupiers kept receipts for things as quotidian as loves of bread. It's not unreasonable to expect a record of a fairly political execution- yet there are none. Nor any other trail records of any kind for a guy with 'Christ' in his name. Odd.

966117335181410304 2018-02-20 01:08:16 UTC <howtoheretic> @jonjones My theory? When your entire world view is based on a cluster of unsupportable lies & every act one makes is done in bad faith &/or solely for compensation, one cannot fathom others acting in good faith or for unselfish reasons. They project their motive stcuctre onto others.

965794646570942464 2018-02-19 03:46:01 UTC <howtoheretic> @crazybrigham Point of order here Brother Brigham- A coward is a functional person who knows it's wrong to do a thing but is afraid and so does it anyway. Mitt is not a coward, he knows as much about right and wrong as an Intel 8088 punch card computer in a blue suit.

965271931741134849 2018-02-18 17:08:57 UTC <howtoheretic> @PorkchopDonut @WaywardWillis Look, I guess what we're saying is that during the grind of your family prayer treat yourself to a little staycation, ya know, a balladay.
965270169013567489 2018-02-18 17:01:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @PorkchopDonut @WaywardWillis Sure, southern person, sure. We don't play like that here in Utah- oh wait.
965268562888634368 2018-02-18 16:55:33 UTC <howtoheretic> @WaywardWillis I suggest playing it a little more cool than that, but hey, I don't know what your family's holiday dinners are like. Read the room.
965267926625353728 2018-02-18 16:53:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @WaywardWillis Or uphill. Pessimist.
965267614191689728 2018-02-18 16:51:47 UTC <howtoheretic> @WaywardWillis Was there other stuff? I can't remember.
965266001536335873 2018-02-18 16:45:23 UTC <howtoheretic> Hey y'all! Here is the free-to-our-adoring public appearance we made on The Wayward Willis podcast! It was a great discussion about life, love and playing with your balls under the table during prayers. Really.https://twitter.com/WaywardWillis/status/965262328492183557
965245873939668992 2018-02-18 15:25:24 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtomicDaydreams There may be some modern interpretation of them - but taken as the rather simple statements they originally are, saying things are moving, therefore someone is moving them is is basically a begging the question fallacy and as weak as any other god claim.
965109210949173248 2018-02-17 06:22:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass The cluelessness is breathtaking. Though hardly surprising for this broken, soulless man.
965108746706829317 2018-02-17 06:20:30 UTC <howtoheretic> If only one Republican politician (who work behind rings of gun-free protection) had the courage of any one of these kids, maybe we could get somewhere with this mechanized slaughter epidemic.

965102425546752000 2018-02-17 05:55:23 UTC <howtoheretic> @amandablount2 PLEASE! Everyone reading this spread THIS to everyone in your reach, frame fearful gun fetishism as what it is - A HOBBY! Refer to it only as that, and the people who cower behind guns as HOBBYISTS. They are not part of a well regulated militia- THE HAVE A HOBBY.
965099772347531264 2018-02-17 05:44:51 UTC <howtoheretic> @amandablount2 If model trains, another hobby, killed 40k Americans a year there would be no more model trains. If an HO scale train killed 20+ 1st graders in horror in a single morning, there would never be another HO scale train convention. ITS-A-FUCKING-HOBBY.
965097099636310019 2018-02-17 05:34:13 UTC <howtoheretic> @amandablount2 Their demand is that we reconstruct all life in America in such a way that their hobby can metastasize unchecked. Armed guards, metal detectors, constant shooter drills at schools, fear of public life and gathering ad infinitum. How about they give up their fucking hobby?
965094068832186373 2018-02-17 05:22:11 UTC <howtoheretic> And not all heroes wear control tops, spray tan, laughably terrible hair-turbans, loose fitting and unreliable dental appliances, Scotch-taped ties, awful baggy suits, Kremlin issued shock-collars adult diapers.

965085527950028801 2018-02-17 04:48:14 UTC <howtoheretic> Can we ease up on our countrymen suffering from mental illness?

965080101598539778 2018-02-17 04:26:41 UTC <howtoheretic> So sorry young friend. Your country has failed both of you profoundly. Most of us are trying to fix it. Thanks for putting your pain and your voice out here for people to see the reality of this American horror. Love and hope for a full recovery for all of you.
965069915244736513 2018-02-17 03:46:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @usmagrad87 I feel completely confident he has not. To Joe the UN is evil incarnate. I would invite him to spend a summer in a country where human rights and minority protections were never made into the law of man. Let's see how he feels about god's largesse then.
965065211542581248 2018-02-17 03:27:31 UTC <howtoheretic> Joe, what a fucking dope. Politicians argued & wrote down rights as enforceable by law. If it all comes from god, why don't all countries share our rights, and why do some have more/better ones? Perhaps because their foundational docs & enforcements vary? Or Jesus loves us more?https://twitter.com/patorrezlaw/status/965063588686725120

965011989981364224 2018-02-17 23:56:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtomicDaydreams Hey Oliver- you mean Straw-Person arguments? Hmmmmm. Not being flippant here but as an adult I can't think of one. I read Aquinas' 5 Ways after we talked to Jim, and they are useless as some kind of proof. Thats the best answer I've got.
965003395714056193 2018-02-17 23:21:53 UTC <howtoheretic> And worse, you KNOW he will be unable not to attack her. He's far too fragile to let a female person with an Hispanic name criticize him. I hope he doesn't, but I know he will. OMG what a failure of a human being.
964994431593062401 2018-02-17 22:46:15 UTC <howtoheretic> With this girl being mean to him and no golfing for a whole day, I bet Donald's diapers are super full. The sacrifices he makes for us, people.https://twitter.com/OhNoSheTwitnt/status/964988979547394049

964771388992057344 2018-02-16 07:59:58 UTC <howtoheretic> Hey @marcorubio I haven't heard back from you Senator. Let me help you understand a metric other than NRA money. You're famously thirsty. 30,000 US gun deaths a year pencil out to 45,000 gallons of blood. How refreshing that much blood money must be!! Cheers death whore!

964313942834098176 2018-02-15 01:42:14 UTC <howtoheretic> @SarahKSilverman The only 'facts' @marcorubio is interested in come in the form of pieces of paper with big numbers written on them from his masters at the NRA.

964210881193172992 2018-02-15 18:52:42 UTC <howtoheretic> @UtahOutcasts If idiotic Christianist cities want to be a massive cash cow for the good work the ACLU does, I suppose thats their right.
964192034704703488 2018-02-15 17:37:49 UTC <howtoheretic> Good thread. It leans on the thinking side of 'thoughts and prayers', so proceed with caution.https://twitter.com/markpopham/status/964157761427787777

964024986708029440 2018-02-14 06:34:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @itsrupaulryan My guess? You have to be able to read in order to lie properly on the SF-86 form. Sarah can't pass because her home-schooling curriculum was: Gravy- you can do it!; Banjo- mens only; Bible, them parts Daddy reads to you; Lying-only for any and all-powerful menfolk.
963994764117880832 2018-02-14 04:33:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @Womenwthoutrlgn @marcorubio Seriously please explain how you are not a total nihilist? Is $$$ worth doing everything possible to promote the mechanized murder of children in your state & country? This is a serious question. If I gave you 3 million dollars would you answer me?
963971544257974272 2018-02-14 03:01:40 UTC <howtoheretic> OK Uncle Mark is a gun owner. Just 1, & I don't need it. It's a hobby. So are model trains. If model trains killed 30-40k American's a year, would we still allow unfettered model trains? I model trains killed 20+ first graders ever, would we still allow HO conventions?

963965269394640896 2018-02-14 02:36:44 UTC <howtoheretic> This is our American horror. The NRA is reading these texts and having a hearty laugh.

963954621621219328 2018-02-14 01:54:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname Super weird! Kinda hard to hide all the parts you didn't eat (please don't ask how I know that)
963952369850437632 2018-02-14 01:45:28 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname WTF is this?
963946885760270336 2018-02-14 01:23:41 UTC <howtoheretic> Oh wow! Proof that even the swineist American's once said the PoA without 'Under God'!

963910218756182017 2018-02-14 22:57:59 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop At least the green color is appropriately barfy and putrid.
963822055824138240 2018-02-14 17:07:39 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass HAHAHAHA! We prescribe some stanky rotten blood honey. It'll probably kill you, but then the laughing will stop.

962951512438718464 2018-02-11 07:28:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @AndreSaysHello @CatHaRsIS_22 @ChurchofSatan So defensive, so huffy. Why? Y'all are on a hair trigger for the sons of the fallen one. I love a flair for the dramatic, but this is unbecoming. I tweeted that I accepted the correction. Again COS, my DMs are open, you have the floor if you want to come on my show. Talk to me
962949241873219584 2018-02-11 07:19:24 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @AndreSaysHello @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 Yet they fall silent again. Bunch of bitches insert themselves into a conversation, blast out squid ink and chaff when honest inquiry is engaged, then disappear when an invitation to curious inquiry in private or public is offered. Cool club guys.
962946446541467648 2018-02-11 07:08:18 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @AndreSaysHello @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 All I have done tonight is ask for clarification of how legally/morally free speech absolutists can claim an ancient fictional name is theirs alone- they jumped into the discussion, I didn't make them do a fucking thing. In fact, I am asking for an open dialogue now.
962945637875466241 2018-02-11 07:05:05 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @AndreSaysHello @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 Cat, the whole origin of this idiotic back and forth is the COS insisting - with you working the oars - that Satan+ism was theirs exclusively. I didn't @ them or anything. They belly-flopped in screaming it was theirs then got all fucking damaged and huffy when I asked how.
962944235509972992 2018-02-11 06:59:31 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @AndreSaysHello @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 Read your tweet back to yourself. They don't own it, and they can't. How is it not possible to understand the irony of the disciples of the great rebel and symbol of freedom getting all huffy about ownership of a word?
962943116213813249 2018-02-11 06:55:04 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @AndreSaysHello @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 I'm confused? How?
962942126542635008 2018-02-11 06:51:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @AndreSaysHello @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 Brother Cat, I advise you not to assume people don't know things. I've known about LaVey and his movement since I was in high school in the early 80's. I've been an anti-religious student and activist since '85. A survivor or Mormon cultism. I got this.
962941360004243456 2018-02-11 06:48:05 UTC <howtoheretic> @SkepticNikki Nichole I should have said it when I saw the tweet- As an Ex-Mormon podcaster when you said that the missionaries came to the door but you were naked cooking pancakes I screamed involuntarily. Don't know you, but I love you.
962939871542177793 2018-02-11 06:42:10 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @AndreSaysHello @CatHaRsIS_22 @ChurchofSatan Sooo, since we're here, dispense with the huffy histrionics and help me understand your position. Like I said, I reckon we are working the same corner against the Christo-fascist boogie man, and you can come on my show guys!
962939061156462592 2018-02-11 06:38:57 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @AndreSaysHello @CatHaRsIS_22 @ChurchofSatan I wouldn't know your position if it bit me on the dick, so enlighten me. My activity tonight was based on y'all acting like your 1966 articles of incorporation entitled you to ownership of any conjunction of Satan and ist. I didn't make you tweet me, you did that, kids.
962937572103090178 2018-02-11 06:33:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @AndreSaysHello @CatHaRsIS_22 @ChurchofSatan There you are! Glad to see you back. I feel like I've misstated nothing. But in the interest of understanding- I feel like we are seriously kindred spirits in the good fight in the 21st Century- I am all ears.
962936084945448960 2018-02-11 06:27:07 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @LucienGreaves @AndreSaysHello @CatHaRsIS_22 And after batting down a blizzard of weird COS canards and dodges they went silent. I have asked repeatedly for either public or private DM chats. Screaming about free speech by trying to stop that of others, then refusing to dialogue is a bad look, no? Hail Satan
962935396551180288 2018-02-11 06:24:23 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @LucienGreaves @AndreSaysHello @CatHaRsIS_22 Uhh, maybe follow back this whole convo brother Cat. I am a free speech advocate (just shy of an absolutist) and this all began with the COS insisting they had exclusive claim to both Satan and ist. That is poppycock from a legal and free speech perspective.
962934582818451457 2018-02-11 06:21:09 UTC <howtoheretic> Y'all got rally quiet. I'm a friendly. Chat in public or private. Come on my show. Lets get a beer. Does my breath stink?
962933341635805184 2018-02-11 06:16:13 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @LucienGreaves @AndreSaysHello @CatHaRsIS_22 I feel like that isn't where we started in this convo. But I could be wrong. If that is your belief you are very much outside what the COS has been arguing here tonight. They are ferocious in insisting a 3k yo fairy tale is their property exclusively.
962931900510699520 2018-02-11 06:10:30 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @LucienGreaves @AndreSaysHello @CatHaRsIS_22 Errr. Hmmm. Can you elaborate? I feel like you've been telling me and Andre and all that nobody but the legally incorporated COS of 1966 can use that name/title. That was your whole thing. Now you're saying whatev YOLO?
962929919566098433 2018-02-11 06:02:37 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @LucienGreaves @AndreSaysHello @CatHaRsIS_22 Cat, do you officially speak for the COS? I've asked the official @ to help me understand this tone policing of a public domain term by free speech absolutists and they got super quiet. I'm not hostile, I think we should be judged by our own principles. Can you explain?
962928103801552896 2018-02-11 05:55:24 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @LucienGreaves @CatHaRsIS_22 @AndreSaysHello Sorry- Different, not 'no different'.
962927552502251520 2018-02-11 05:53:13 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @LucienGreaves @CatHaRsIS_22 @AndreSaysHello Why that test is no different for Satanists I have no earthly clue. Again, for absolutist liberty radicals to be so hysterical about policing other peoples self expression is baffling. Please help me understand.
962926854419103744 2018-02-11 05:50:27 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @LucienGreaves @CatHaRsIS_22 @AndreSaysHello Yes Andre. I produce a podcast for people on the edge of or new to skepticism. Cat, I suspect you & I would agree on 99% of things. So, you know my test for if someone is a Christian or not? I ask- Are you a Christian? If they say 'Yes', I accept it. There is no blood test.
962925556403650561 2018-02-11 05:45:17 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 Yet friend, here you are saying that because of a legal filing in a country that bronze age people had never heard of 3k years after the invention of a fictional character & because of an issue of tense, the Satanists you don't agree with can't use the name? You see my confusion?
962924600651689984 2018-02-11 05:41:29 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 Ok. Cat you surely observe how the 30,000 flavors of Christianity all claim that they are the one true keeper of that almost meaningless word. Either just one of them is right, or ALL of them are wrong. I suspect you and I think agree on what the answer is.
962922134052876289 2018-02-11 05:31:41 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @CatHaRsIS_22 @ChurchofSatan We're getting somewhere! However I am curious about the context of the word 'collectivism' in your church's lexicon. Can you define it?
962921662080417792 2018-02-11 05:29:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 And Cat my DMs are open. Oddly the COS is shy about having a private convo to help me understand this odd conundrum. I'm happy to chat publicly, or maybe you can speak for them  in my DMs?
962920767095582720 2018-02-11 05:26:15 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 LaVey wasn't also a media opportunist and a self promoter? I have no dog in the fight about him but I have been paying attention to the movement he left behind for 30 years. COS has no promotional interests?
962920128793882624 2018-02-11 05:23:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 Why?
962919222417408000 2018-02-11 05:20:07 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 No man this isn't a court of law! Let's understand each other. I accept you making a good faith argument. Understand I am as well. I am baffled by 1966's free speech radicals getting super precious about other people exercising free speech. Am I crazy?
962918740839997440 2018-02-11 05:18:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @CatHaRsIS_22 @ChurchofSatan The well done! My family was caught up in the panic for years and it was destructive to my whole society here in God's own Salt Lake City.
962918365923762177 2018-02-11 05:16:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 Cat, massively super bad example. Especially because Christianity/their bible is mostly a guide book for slavery. Lets move on. What about TST (in which I have no stake) is even slightly equivalent in your mind?
962916399139102720 2018-02-11 05:08:54 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 Hmmm. I think that cat is 200 years out of the bag in America. But I am listening Cat.
962915948855357440 2018-02-11 05:07:06 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @CatHaRsIS_22 Hey Cat. Point taken. I'm sure you accept my points about the word Satan not being own-able. I suspect you are being hyperbolic and not accusing TST of condoning slavery or some kind of modern version of that? Lets be rational in our terms.
962912743798943744 2018-02-11 04:54:22 UTC <howtoheretic> Please don't be shy. Lucien was on our pod and seemed a fine fellow. But I'm a skeptic. My skepticism demands I hear all comers and be open to being convinced. Seriously, happy to chat. Please stop by
962906819550093312 2018-02-11 04:30:50 UTC <howtoheretic> @ChurchofSatan Hey man, if you want to help me understand my DM's are open. Find me there?
962903412961558528 2018-02-11 04:17:18 UTC <howtoheretic> @mike_pence @VP @iamDANadian Hahaha! Poor, sad husk of a man.
962902788400283649 2018-02-11 04:14:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @LucienGreaves @AndreSaysHello Andre, I think you are on to something ;)
962902194667249664 2018-02-11 04:12:27 UTC <howtoheretic> @iamDANadian Ick. Whats his real @?
962901798703972354 2018-02-11 04:10:53 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan Honestly, my DM's are open, if you want to chat privately I'm truly trying to understand the issue.
962901476195557378 2018-02-11 04:09:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @iamDANadian Barf
962901376354304000 2018-02-11 04:09:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan Con? What con? Your church is pretty absolutist in it's claims for maximum freedom. Based on that why are you so pissed off by other people using a word? Again, I'm not a hostile. I just find this behavior unbecoming of the disciples of Lucifer. Help me understand.
962900256517103617 2018-02-11 04:04:45 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass It's gross I know, but you KNOW it happened.
962900063247769600 2018-02-11 04:03:59 UTC <howtoheretic> @mike_pence @VP @iamDANadian For fuck's sake, he has a fan account?
962899925733277697 2018-02-11 04:03:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan Legal definitions are generally considered the height of rational discussion. I am on your side in general, but I am baffled by all the diversions and canards. What is your rational defense against other groups calling themselves Satanists?
962899286248718336 2018-02-11 04:00:54 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan What other people's talking points do you mean? The copyright and trademark laws of the United States? My opinions and my professional/legal knowledge are my own. I'm not trolling, I'm trying to understand your anti-libertarian defensiveness.
962898064053694465 2018-02-11 03:56:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan The uber powerful and highly litigious Disney corp may be mad when other people use those characters, but because of the nature of our laws they can't do anything about it unless they use the look of the Disney version. AND Disney does not make your claim for maximum freedom.
962897215483035648 2018-02-11 03:52:40 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan OK COS, this might help with the legal understanding: Everybody thinks Disney owns Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. They don't. Those stories are in the public domain, despite the broad assumptions they own the trademarks.
962895912614821890 2018-02-11 03:47:29 UTC <howtoheretic> @MikePenceVP This is what gay people who don't hate themselves look like Mike. It's not too late to renounce all your evil and walk in truth. Love yourself a little more and be free!https://twitter.com/guskenworthy/status/961989267911098368
962895017604874240 2018-02-11 03:43:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan @LucienGreaves Could be (as old as I am I was born a little) after 1966. But we are responsible to understand history that predates us, and if we are arguing for a pure form of human freedom, it is absurd to demand that other people can't use language as they see fit. Balderdash COS.
962893939123433472 2018-02-11 03:39:39 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan It was you that tried to make this point- how is it a 'side rail'? Anybody can use anything in the public domain for anything they like. Isn't maximum freedom kind of your thing? That is a totally earnest question.
962893062941716480 2018-02-11 03:36:10 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan Friend, it is you that seem to be claiming the trademark. Why so defensive?
962892813837848576 2018-02-11 03:35:11 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan COS, I'm not, not on your side in the fight against evil. But if your guiding principle is max freedom for everyone, this argument that you & only you own American Satanism is limiting to the autonomy of others, no? Shouldn't the Western world's great rebel belong to everyone?
962888269087227904 2018-02-11 03:17:07 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan Again 'Christianity' is in what is legally referred to as the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it in the name of a business or church whether they believe in the myth of the Nazarene or not. The bible is also in that legal space.
962887728374341632 2018-02-11 03:14:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan I have no idea where the horticulture thing originates. But legally the idea of Satan  cannot be trademarked under US law.
962886426185547781 2018-02-11 03:09:48 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan Well done you. But if the nightmare of religion has taught us anything, it's that the oldest version of a thing is automatically the best ;)
962885365802479616 2018-02-11 03:05:35 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan On my podcast I work like crazy to knock down the garbage foundations of privileged Christianist assumptions that harm minorities and generally fuck up society. But in my day job, I deal with intellectual properties all day. Satan is what we call public domain.
962883126014849025 2018-02-11 02:56:41 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @Crom_Almighty @ChurchofSatan Hey good people, not trying to be a huge literature/history Nazi here, but I feel like the whole idea of the character of Satan predates 1966. Am I wrong?
962880330192404482 2018-02-11 02:45:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Sad but true. Look at the swan Adam Rippon is vs the self-hating snail Pence is. He is loathsome, but my empathetic heart can't help but feel for the sad, shitty creature religion has made of Pence.
962879336943534081 2018-02-11 02:41:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose He is such a sadly transparent closet case.
962878165939974145 2018-02-11 02:36:58 UTC <howtoheretic> So Mike Pence & I both watched Adam Rippon skate. Me- I am flush with joy and magnetism for a briiliant & ahtlete artist & a stunning man. Pence- sobbing bitterly while he repeatedly smashes his shame on the edge of a table with the family bible and curses his own nature.
962875580763877377 2018-02-11 02:26:42 UTC <howtoheretic> @cmclymer Hahahaha!
962873588855357440 2018-02-11 02:18:47 UTC <howtoheretic> OMG just watched @Adaripp skate- I'm ruined! What a spectacular artist, what a gorgeous man, and on top of it all he humiliated the vile Mike Pence? Adam is what makes America great. Fight me!

962853175731437568 2018-02-11 00:57:40 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose @ChurchofSatan Clarification accepted.

962851912113508352 2018-02-11 00:52:39 UTC <howtoheretic> It's good to see there are still some religious people in America who can see our reality show nightmare for what it is.

962848269448523776 2018-02-11 00:38:10 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose We had a great chat with the head of the Satanic Temple, Lucien Greaves in Ep#16, in case you missed it. He talks about the non-theistic nature of their religion.
962847114182066176 2018-02-11 00:33:35 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Hail Satan!
962846880475504640 2018-02-11 00:32:39 UTC <howtoheretic> @ChurchofSatan @Secular_Rose Wrong bunch I think Rose. Check out the @satanicpsalms. They are the non-theistic Satanists. For them the Satan of literature is symbolic of rebellion and autonomy.

962482879916748800 2018-02-10 00:26:15 UTC <howtoheretic> Please tell me the 'media consulting firm' the head of the railroads was moonlighting for was called 'The Fancy Electric Telegraph Guild'.https://twitter.com/RedTRaccoon/status/962466999992537089
962379470475636736 2018-02-10 17:35:20 UTC <howtoheretic> @mattdhensley And on top of that, we're all still waiting for the 'unbelievable' evidence his investigators are turning up in Hawaii.

962198725366988801 2018-02-09 05:37:07 UTC <howtoheretic> Watching VP Pence refuse to stand for the unified Korean team at the opening ceremonies made me mad at first. Then sad for such a mediocre, self loathing, useless sack of closeted oatmeal failure that doesn't deserve to be in the company of such excellence and courage.
962164565009051648 2018-02-09 03:21:23 UTC <howtoheretic> @SecondLady @VP @Reuters @filmystic To be fair, Pence couldn't stand up because all he could think about was this-pic.twitter.com/8z7f0zFt2H
962151489056600064 2018-02-09 02:29:25 UTC <howtoheretic> The only thing that forgettable Pence was known for before being VP was single handedly imploding Indiana's economy because of his transphobia and homophobia. Don't let this vile Christianist weasel pretend he's not exactly that. Lying pice of shit.https://twitter.com/HRC/status/962121435996151809
961830106636304389 2018-02-08 05:12:22 UTC <howtoheretic> And what more proof do you need that Orrin Hatch is a footman to fascism and an enabler of violence against women and vulnerable people in the pursuit of tax cuts and corporate profits-https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/02/08/white-house-officials-ex-wives-say-their-mormon-bishops-were-no-help-when-they-were-abused/

961808019787952131 2018-02-08 03:44:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Ha! You'd be surprised about my knowledge of marketing. And I think they would be silly not to accept our offer. But they likely won't. I just want our Heretics to know we are always looking for ways to expand the brand!
961807167551455232 2018-02-08 03:41:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Yeah, people who reference the bible. That includes us!
961806552154832896 2018-02-08 03:38:46 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Dan? Pfft! I'm the out-of-the-box strategist! And I was totally serious- If the goal is to sell these little MP3 players, they should market them to whomever wants to buy them, no?
961805871922556928 2018-02-08 03:36:04 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Sure did! They promised a response within 48 hours- that was 2 weeks ago.
961805146136064000 2018-02-08 03:33:10 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics, we asked Wonder Bible to sponsor our show. After all, who needs an easy to reference audio bible more than well informed skeptics in the defense of our Constitutional rights- They have not responded. They should do this, right? https://www.wonderbible.com/
961794661261049856 2018-02-08 02:51:31 UTC <howtoheretic> And clearly everyone is being overly generous in assuming Porter's fully disclosed history of criminal violence against women was not what Trump and Kelly found attractive about him. They knew and fought like mad to defend him.
961790813683441664 2018-02-08 02:36:13 UTC <howtoheretic> His ex-wives also sought help from their Mormon bishops, and in short were told to suck it up and deal with it.

961320746256510976 2018-02-07 19:28:21 UTC <howtoheretic> Fascinating thread that relates to the necessity of challenging presumptions and not accepting what religion claims to be inerrant, unchanging truths. Well worth the read!https://twitter.com/medievalpoc/status/961291853525127169
961314960746754048 2018-02-07 19:05:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Same as it ever was, I guess.
961314871793954816 2018-02-07 19:05:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass And as usual, the work/lives of people of color being co-opted by a Euro-centric world view. It's like Elvis claiming rock and roll as his, but with the mother of god.
961313825344516097 2018-02-07 19:00:50 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Oh yeah. I see. Here in Mormon country the image of Jesus is always like Ryan Gosling with slightly brown wig on. Certainly to early American (and passed down to the current version) Christianity the idea that their man/gods could be non-white was inconceivable.
961311238314536960 2018-02-07 18:50:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass For real I'm missing the source of the question? Who was saying she was white?

961305282608447488 2018-02-07 18:26:54 UTC <howtoheretic> @GodlessApeMan @Renevelation @Secular_Rose Ignore. It's rambling, crazy and no science does not prove the existence of god.
961302437876269056 2018-02-07 18:15:35 UTC <howtoheretic> @JAdomian Somebody needs to photoshop a golf cart parked by the owl. It's like 500 feet from the parking lot, no way Cheeto would ever be able to shamble that far.
961300295102840832 2018-02-07 18:07:05 UTC <howtoheretic> @probablyforsale Oof, right? I've said that a thousand times!
961297218157203456 2018-02-07 17:54:51 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass So it begins. The long prophesied crossover of Revelations and Aesop's Fables! See you on the other side Heretics!
961296666887258113 2018-02-07 17:52:40 UTC <howtoheretic> @probablyforsale I suppose that makes the anal probing you experienced all the more complicated now.

961273706071773185 2018-02-07 16:21:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @Keithtimber Could be that. Could be that he's just a howling lunatic.

960708125014736896 2018-02-05 02:54:00 UTC <howtoheretic> OK I have a science question- what is it that makes the dry, crackly garbage-poison food Doritos not crunch? My fear is that it's just moisture? Women 'want' soggy salt-poison 'cheese' throwing stars? I feel like we're all having a stroke at the same time.
960705746336825344 2018-02-05 02:44:33 UTC <howtoheretic> @Smartiecats @WhaJoTalkinBout Sherlock Ham... I don't think I'm doing it right.

960530784695156736 2018-02-05 15:09:19 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Early access to Ep#20- Don't Sleep in the (Tokyo) Subway- for Patrons starts now! Uncle Dan and Uncle Mark detect a pattern, we explore the less than ideal juncture of religion and nerve gas, and @andrewcopson makes the case for secularism! Give a listen!
960411736246333440 2018-02-04 07:16:16 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad @OfOttawa And anthropology aside- though thats my happy place so tell me if you want to swim there further- the subject in question is the matched set of Old and New Testament. I yearn for a cogent defense of these incoherent volumes from a moral position.
960410800748834816 2018-02-04 07:12:33 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad @OfOttawa Now I'm not hating on our Semitic brethren. My Celtic ancestors were scratching at the dirt and killing each other almost as fast as they could reproduce. My point is there were more developed and sophisticated societies than Judea.
960410058268975104 2018-02-04 07:09:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad @OfOttawa Jokes aside Shane, the desert dwellers of a lesser Roman colony were far behind any number of regions of the world in- everything. The Greeks had logic, the Arabs had optics and algebra, the Mayans invented 0, the Chinese were in another universe of development altogether.
960409091968401408 2018-02-04 07:05:45 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad @OfOttawa I'm honored you have a solid lock on my ancestors. Kudos for the rapid geno-typing old boy. Tell me, am I susceptible to any rheumatoid joint conditions?
960408419516661760 2018-02-04 07:03:05 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad @OfOttawa Hi Shane, and, huh?
960405177508315136 2018-02-04 06:50:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad @OfOttawa let me know if you'd like a chat. I have a TON of questions pertaining to the morality of the Old Testament. And if we can get through that subject together the dissection of the New Testament is just as juicy. I look forward to your reply.
960403851248467969 2018-02-04 06:44:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad Thanks GG. @OfOttowa, Am I misreading the moment here? My impression is you're an avid Christian apologist? I am a podcaster for new/newish skeptics with a deep knowledge of the Bible and a load of other holy books. It's harder than ever to find a sane defender of them.
960401434754691072 2018-02-04 06:35:20 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad @OfOttawa Godless G, can you direct Shane my way? One of the key interests of my podcast is understanding how the ancient traditions of one of the world's most ignorant backwaters can be shoehorned into meaning in the 21st Century. I am not kidding.
960399673113522177 2018-02-04 06:28:20 UTC <howtoheretic> @PedestrianPoet Hey Clark, if you are interested in a conversation, I have been thinking all day about what you said about ex-Mormons. I really want to try to understand your position on them (us). Tweet back if you want to.
960397978270801925 2018-02-04 06:21:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad @OfOttowa Not kidding Shane, this is a 100% serious inquiry. I really want to discuss how a modern person can make sense of the Bible. Standing by for a chat.
960396710794047489 2018-02-04 06:16:33 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad Hey GG, hey Shane, sorry to insert myself here- late to this chat- I'm truly fascinated by a smart person who is willing to offer apologetics for regional Iron Age folk tales as guides to Post Enlightenment life. Shane is that your side of this discussion? If so plz hit me back.

960205697269968896 2018-02-04 17:37:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop Uh, sure. Thats a lot of words that I can't seem to make work in unison. But I'm glad at least you got a wee sip of wine.
960204155716423680 2018-02-04 17:31:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop HAHAHAHA! Now I remember! Wow what a fun mass!
960201819472277504 2018-02-04 17:22:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop Just for the less informed people here, pretend I don't ;)
960201336770867200 2018-02-04 17:20:13 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop Sounds very spiritual.  Also, what were you doing at mass, Rudy?
960192137936617472 2018-02-04 16:43:39 UTC <howtoheretic> @PedestrianPoet There are also accounts of those who weren't down with it. Are they rattle-snakes as well?  Also, as prophecy goes it's fun to remember his prophecy of 1,000 yo Quaker people living on the moon. That was a classic.
960190950428454913 2018-02-04 16:38:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @mormonstories @PedestrianPoet Ah! Everyone who disagrees -everyone- is a liar? What an incredible fail-safe you've built into a closed system to keep from ever having to re-examine it! Bravo! Or, just maybe, could it be the architects of your faith had some issues with truth? I am an Ex-Mo, so....
960190196204498944 2018-02-04 16:35:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @PedestrianPoet Here's my point. If we've learned anything about powerful sexual predators -Weinstein, Cosby, Trump - it's that they're only able to do it by being surrounded by enablers. Even though he's long dead, you are being an enabler now. Excusing Joseph sends a message to girls alive now
960189339417264128 2018-02-04 16:32:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @PedestrianPoet Bruv, that is not true. Listen to hour after hour of post-Mormon's on @mormonstories express the shock they felt when they learned about his behavior after years of official denial. I know there is no good answer, but a lie doesn't fix that.
960184431666327552 2018-02-04 16:13:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @PedestrianPoet Yup. You are exactly right. The 'mob' that' killed him was full of the men in question. But quite the heroic spin you put on it- so why did the church deny his polygamy for so long? Especially when it was a matter of record and, ya know, the truth?
960182724450398208 2018-02-04 16:06:15 UTC <howtoheretic> @PedestrianPoet Cool story. But when men came home from 2-3 year missions and found Joseph had taken their wives and/or daughters in their convenient absence, do you feel like they were satisfied with that answer? I'm not, and he wasn't sleeping with my daughter! Wow they must have been pissed!
960180640892137472 2018-02-04 15:57:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @PedestrianPoet All also have agency to not recognize the president of a mall company as a 'prophet' at all. But back to Joseph - missionary program- invented to poach married women and daughters? Or just a lucky bi-product for the sexual predator who created it?
960054673058050048 2018-02-03 07:37:25 UTC <howtoheretic> They were not only totally unaware of kangaroos, but such trifles as the Americas, Japan, India, snow, where the sun went at night, Jupiter, why weather happened, that you shouldn't drink water you shit in, viruses, gravity, that slavery is a bad, that women are people.....https://twitter.com/MrOzAtheist/status/960049552622432256
960051176141017088 2018-02-03 07:23:31 UTC <howtoheretic> @PedestrianPoet Hi Clark! Being gay is neither a choice nor a sin. Mormonism IS a choice though. Here's a fun exercise, did Joseph invent the missionary program to separate wives/daughters from husbands so he could fuck them, or was that just a lucky side effect of men leaving for 2-3 years?

958930233645703169 2018-01-31 05:09:18 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass feel so oppressed by the burden of being a B- rich kid would scoff at a picture of Emmet Till in his coffin as fake news, or would refuse to understand the historical context of that story. So, as a fully vested white guy, I join you in telling these shitlords to f-ck off.
958928611389526016 2018-01-31 05:02:51 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass I suspect Tori a lot of the shitbags arguing with you on Twitter are trust fund frat-bros who think that they didn't get into Cornell because some Affirmative Action black lesbian took their place-therefore oppression. The same people who
958927444899086336 2018-01-31 04:58:13 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Acknowledging the facts of European expansion and slavery costs white Americans not a single penny nor an evening of imposition, yet they refuse to do it. It's baffling and infuriating and proves that shitty public education and the inertia of privilege still vex society.
958925714048278528 2018-01-31 04:51:20 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Asking white people (my people) to simply acknowledge that centuries of brutality, rape, murder, displacement and horror happened is just that. It won't even make them late for brunch- But they can't do even that.
958925052568682496 2018-01-31 04:48:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass They seem to feel like if they accept there has been 400+ years of white tyranny and terrorism they might have to let someone into the waitlist for brunch ahead of them. When all that is being asked from people of color is an honest appraisal of an obvious history.
958924102886031366 2018-01-31 04:44:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Speaking as a white person here- most white people seem ferociously opposed to the idea that they as present day individuals should even be bothered to acknowledge there has ever been injustice.

957485701095817216 2018-01-27 05:29:15 UTC <howtoheretic> @Smartiecats @C_Stroop @peter_petefloyd No problem Peter- send me your home address and I'll have two 18 year old beardless boys from Roy and Hurricane at your place in 20 minutes to tell you your whole life and everything you believe and do is wrong. Operators are standing by- #ExMormonConfessions
957484452208234496 2018-01-27 05:24:17 UTC <howtoheretic> @Smartiecats @C_Stroop @peter_petefloyd Oh ok. Just try to be specific  #ExMormonConfessions
957483833217114112 2018-01-27 05:21:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @Smartiecats @C_Stroop @peter_petefloyd But in what measure of time? Science, man! These things matter!!! #ExMormonConfessions
957483273768247296 2018-01-27 05:19:36 UTC <howtoheretic> Ok, how many gay ex-mo's share this story?  I do!https://twitter.com/mitoutumlaut/status/957480229210959872
957478437760847872 2018-01-27 05:00:23 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Oh young Tori, savor the heartburn, it all just keeps getting so much worse ;)
957472449477582849 2018-01-27 04:36:35 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop Oh for sure! The more expensive the better, especially if the laughs are paid for by those who stole so much of our time, our money and our precious youth's from us all!
957466946244509697 2018-01-27 04:14:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @ivonnatinkle I am very connected to the WW bar- and actually, it's not named after the quotidian water divining rod (but they play on that association). It's named after something even more delish! Go ask the boys for the full story (there's a hint in the painting over the booths)!
957462611733303296 2018-01-27 03:57:30 UTC <howtoheretic> Whaddya say Ex-Mormon Heretics? Me first- As a deacon I smushed all the uneaten sacrament Wonder bread into a super-dense cube with my dirty 12 yo fingers and savored it! #ExMormonConfessionshttps://twitter.com/C_Stroop/status/957433493700694016

957460390597738496 2018-01-27 03:48:40 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop @Smartiecats Agreed! Laughter through the tears, as the great prophet Jerri Blank always says!
957459091927965696 2018-01-27 03:43:30 UTC <howtoheretic> @Smartiecats @C_Stroop Oooooh! Funny, we shall do it!!!
957458233685303296 2018-01-27 03:40:06 UTC <howtoheretic> @Smartiecats Thank you so much @C_Stroop ! If you can deal with our profundity mixed with an equal part of jack-assery, we're here for you! I think we and Dr Stroop are kinda working the same side of the street, looking for healing and community through deconstruction and cheap laughs!
956643010204364800 2018-01-25 21:40:41 UTC <howtoheretic> @ivonnatinkle Shit! Weve both been drinking scotch and smoking cigars in equal measure- and neither of us want to quit! What a game of chicken we find ourselves locked in!
956397000655699968 2018-01-24 05:23:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @Kate_Kelly_Esq @ivonnatinkle If you think Jacob and Esau is pointless and stupid, check out the shitshow of contradictory Nativity stories in Ep#13 and the hilarious menu of don'ts that is Leviticus in Ep#9.
956314868662939648 2018-01-24 23:56:46 UTC <howtoheretic> @Kate_Kelly_Esq @ivonnatinkle Sister Ivonna you may have listened to Ep#8 where Uncle Doug talks about just that - that you can do it all on the other side once there is obvious proof. So enjoy yourself now!
956303813119528961 2018-01-24 23:12:50 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname Wed have to take our out first. Make it happen.
956297433813745664 2018-01-24 22:47:30 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname Too easy!
956295786849030145 2018-01-24 22:40:57 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname No Nyck, its the opening lines of the hymn- If I could hye to Kolob, in the twinkling of an eye.... What is the science of this song? The people demand answers!
956294780887162880 2018-01-24 22:36:57 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname Alright then college boy, how far can an average Mormon (say 200 lbs) travel in a twinkling?
956293520108683264 2018-01-24 22:31:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname So, a lot, right?
956254956163665920 2018-01-24 19:58:42 UTC <howtoheretic> @dooce @Kate_Kelly_Esq @ivonnatinkle DM me and lets talk about it!

956240655520583680 2018-01-24 19:01:53 UTC <howtoheretic> @Kate_Kelly_Esq @ivonnatinkle Oh indeed we have chilled our names off years ago. Feels great does it not?
956192783026610176 2018-01-24 15:51:39 UTC <howtoheretic> @godless_mom Oh! You made it! Fun, no?
956192274949574656 2018-01-24 15:49:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop @Matthew72350823 Hahahahaha! Call our voicemail and do it!
956178171128410112 2018-01-24 14:53:35 UTC <howtoheretic> Yo Heretics! Ep#18- How Many Cubits in a Light Year - Is up for all the people of Earth! Wanna go to planet Mormon? There's a song for that, Woo can be prickly, and Dr Christopher Stroop @C_Stroop returns to assure us he's not leaving us behind! #RaptureAnxiety
956052189096669187 2018-01-23 06:32:59 UTC <howtoheretic> It's ok if you're feeling depressed, alone, afraid or desperate. Thats why the good people at the other end of these numbers are hoping for you to call. They WANT to hear from you! Do it! https://twitter.com/Thurgood76/status/955835445140688896
955459658277244928 2018-01-22 15:18:28 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Ep#18 - How Many Cubits in a Light Year - is up for Patrons Now! Make a plan(et) to go to Mormon heaven, want some Woo? Put a pin in it. And we are re-joined by Dr Christopher Stroop @C_Stroop to figure out How-To not be afraid of being left behind! Listen in!
954866965897560065 2018-01-20 00:03:19 UTC <howtoheretic> @RyanShaw412 Heavens, they're a lot like Hell if you ask me!
954784826619564032 2018-01-20 18:36:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @Benny34250184 Thank you! Ben Bergen is a great guest! We are going to do more installments on swearing with different guests. And thanks for including us on you list!
954570317317341186 2018-01-19 04:24:33 UTC <howtoheretic> @OhNoSheTwitnt 2 Corinthians! What don't you libs not understand? Intolerant left.
954522473080356864 2018-01-19 01:14:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @ShanewHick Hey Shane, I'm around a few more days. Hit me back if you want to meet up!
954242082205450240 2018-01-18 06:40:16 UTC <howtoheretic> @ejetzer *your!
954241906552139776 2018-01-18 06:39:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @ejetzer Having spent some time in Montreal and QC, I love your swearing as much as you food!
954199210936623104 2018-01-18 03:49:54 UTC <howtoheretic> I may have just tried to retweet a thing with a horrified comment but ended up retweeting a thing that was not at all deserving a horrified comment. So I erased it forever. Thank you.
954193705094787072 2018-01-18 03:28:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @DirtyWordsCast @WaywardWillis Well, shit
954168479543783424 2018-01-18 01:47:47 UTC <howtoheretic> @DirtyWordsCast @WaywardWillis Hey y'all! I was off the grid today- what happened? A good old fashioned swear off?
954129717820624896 2018-01-18 23:13:46 UTC <howtoheretic> @ShanewHick Shane! DM me!
953854510258098176 2018-01-17 05:00:11 UTC <howtoheretic> @godless_mom If you want some specific stuff as far as food or whatever based on what part of town you are staying in feel free to DM me. I don't live there but I'v spent over a year working there and know it well. Cheers!
953836824396554240 2018-01-17 03:49:55 UTC <howtoheretic> @godless_mom And the Distillery is a fun shopping area to walk around.
953836337689518083 2018-01-17 03:47:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @godless_mom If you can handle heights the CN tower is pretty thrilling. Downtown is fun to walk around, the Moore gallery at the art museum is really cool
953737811596898304 2018-01-17 21:16:28 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Yeah. Barcodes. The LDS Church (and the fearful of it's flock) has always been suspicious of any sort of progress, including efficiencies in retail pricing. Go figure.
953735683495071744 2018-01-17 21:08:01 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass We didn't have it to the extent the Evangelical community does, but there were a lot of conspiratorial ideas that encroached on official doctrine about the UN, barcodes, etc. And the Satanic Panic was huge in SLC Mormonism in the 80's & 90's.
953729938716110848 2018-01-17 20:45:11 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Lucien Greaves had already agreed to perform the ceremony, so now we just have to pick a date!
953675646516908034 2018-01-17 17:09:27 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass HAHAHAHAHA! People were even crazier than they are now!
953674498460475392 2018-01-17 17:04:53 UTC <howtoheretic> Thank you so much @McAtheist ! We do our level best to deconstruct religious presumptions, dig up people who know what they're talking about to help our scattered tribe, and hopefully have a laugh. Thanks for listening!
953649517571719169 2018-01-17 15:25:37 UTC <howtoheretic> Hello Heretics! Ep#17 - F*ck Sh*t G*dd*amn! - is up for the adoring masses now! Come hear about horse gods, feasts of pita and learn How-To swear with Professor Benjamin Bergen! Shit!
953461165895512065 2018-01-16 02:57:11 UTC <howtoheretic> For people who have suffered from #RaptureAnxiety, watching these laughably terrible movies again might offer some useful perspective. Listening to @GodAwfulMovies podcast review's of every single one of them will make laugh until you hurt.  https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/scathing-atheist/god-awful-movieshttps://twitter.com/C_Stroop/status/953457629522784256
953440733758832640 2018-01-16 01:35:59 UTC <howtoheretic> @mitoutumlaut Here is a little treat from Utah's own @Patbagley to friend of the show @C_Stroop . This is a rapture I would feel no anxiety about.
953436963066888192 2018-01-16 01:21:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop Indeed if this movie traumatized you in your childhood, good medicine will be watching this hilariously terrible piece of garbage now and laugh at it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RrXf0zGjxQ
953403495662546944 2018-01-16 23:08:01 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop @FionaKenny1 Indeed he does!
953399365200052224 2018-01-16 22:51:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @FionaKenny1 @RudyHellzapop Indeed! Rudy did floor me with some Irish legal backwardness that shocked even me, and I'm from f-cking Utah!
953124489197338624 2018-01-15 04:39:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @ProPandaPanda Had you not seen Ep IV - VI before? Solid work, as you say extraordinary creative/technical work given their time, and pretty straight forward Black Hat vs White Hat narrative.
953064438889787392 2018-01-15 00:40:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @mnelsonj I love that place. It's kind of a wonderful shit show of all things Mormon/Utah. The grim portraits of old pioneers lining the staircases remind me of Disney's Haunted Mansion! Wow they were not into smiling!
953056086168281088 2018-01-15 00:07:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @ThisAmerLife @jamieleefinch I'll listen as well! FYI all Dr Stoops chat with us about #RaptureAnxiety will post on Jan 22nd (patrons) and Jan 24th (Public) assuming we're all still here! Thanks @C_Stroop for joining us!
952927366191366145 2018-01-15 15:36:03 UTC <howtoheretic> Hey Heretics! Ep#17 - F**K Sh*t G*dd*mn! - is up for Patrons now! Take a wild ride in the Graveyard of the Gods, there's too damned many commandments, and Prof Benjamin Bergen helps us understand why and How-To swear! Not shit!
952748275207045120 2018-01-14 03:44:24 UTC <howtoheretic> @probablyforsale Awwww! Cuddles with Mark and Dan are well within your reach Elder Smith! We love you!
952692416460439552 2018-01-14 00:02:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @shit_mormonssay Dear god
952306458321870848 2018-01-13 22:28:47 UTC <howtoheretic> @jonjones There is a really wonderful staccato to 'suck a ducks dick bitch'. Pretty solid for a troll.
952054730078830592 2018-01-12 05:48:30 UTC <howtoheretic> @therealEmmaHale I was worried because of traumatic childhood experiences I thought the Mo-Tab and the vacant sing-song of conference speak would be upsetting, but it was so without even an attempt at emotion or authentic mourning it was like a dentist's waiting room.
952051929332379648 2018-01-12 05:37:22 UTC <howtoheretic> @therealEmmaHale A friend with a VIP ticket had a +1. I thought, why the fuck not. In addition to being half empty, the scale of the place robs it of any possible intimacy. The event was overly rehearsed, sterile, unemotional. I would have had the same experience watching it on my phone.
952047677121863681 2018-01-12 05:20:29 UTC <howtoheretic> @therealEmmaHale Believe it or not I was there. Floor (where I was) full, 2nd tier maybe 1/3. Upper totally empty. In the defense of the faithful it does have a capacity of like 90 million people.
952042132813922304 2018-01-12 04:58:27 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass @C_Stroop All good. It's on! #RaptureAnxiety
951996085290979328 2018-01-12 01:55:28 UTC <howtoheretic> Hey @C_Stroop - Still hanging out with us tomorrow? Haven't hear back from you Dr!
951653218773221376 2018-01-11 03:13:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @mattdhensley Hahahaha ha. Huh. Simpler times.
951599931998916608 2018-01-11 23:41:18 UTC <howtoheretic> For all our Heretics that live outside the Mormon sphere but find Mormonism interesting in all it's oddities, you might like the wonder & weirdness of Brother Jake's hilarious, fast paced explanations as baffling as they are informative - Enjoy!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0u7ZMWqkr7cKD_rvEXZUuQ
951498229807382529 2018-01-11 16:57:10 UTC <howtoheretic> This kind of quackery is part of what @LucienGreaves was talking about on our last show (Ep#16). Unfortunately it's still pervasive and needs to be identified and done away with.https://twitter.com/LucienGreaves/status/951497183353810944
951233261438582784 2018-01-10 23:24:17 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname For real? OMG please tell me there is video!
951162672870862849 2018-01-10 18:43:47 UTC <howtoheretic> @satanicpsalms @HRKenny Hadar maybe you should talk to @LucienGreaves about opening an Israeli chapter of the Temple?
951157475595632640 2018-01-10 18:23:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @dcamp_83 *Mormon - that typo was not intended. Seriously.
951155082552254465 2018-01-10 18:13:37 UTC <howtoheretic> @dcamp_83 I have some mixed news Derek! Companies like http://Ancestry.com are Moron owned (not by the church itself tho). However, the church does have the largest genealogical database on earth, so almost all other companies use it for their research as well.
951151891001458689 2018-01-10 18:00:57 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop LETS GO AND WORSHIP OTHER GODS TOGETHER CHRISTOPHER!!!!!

951135875647160320 2018-01-10 16:57:18 UTC <howtoheretic> @Keithtimber Yes exactly!
951131172842586112 2018-01-10 16:38:37 UTC <howtoheretic> @Keithtimber Jim is one of our best returning experts. He's able to deconstruct complex ideas clearly for all to understand. And he's very tall!
951127124470935552 2018-01-10 16:22:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @Crom_Almighty @HRKenny He did have a point though - whats $150 between friends when Daddy just set up 2 billion for the other kid's Daddy. Fair is fair ;)
951120602240184320 2018-01-10 15:56:37 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Ep#16- Punnin' with the Devil - Is live for all the people of earth!

950438366436237312 2018-01-08 18:45:39 UTC <howtoheretic> @LucienGreaves @flashbangz89 Thanks Hoosier! Glad you give us a listen! And yes, Lucien Greaves is a religious liberty hero and original thinker that deserves all of our thanks and respect!
950401124246450177 2018-01-08 16:17:40 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Ep#16 - Punnin' with the Devil - is up for Patrons now! Professor Jim comes back to beg a question, we meet the Sikhs, and @LucienGreaves of The Satanic Temple @satanicpsalms stops by to hep explain religious freedom to those who need a refresher! Become a Patron today!
950186843336728578 2018-01-07 02:06:11 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop Hatred of Haiti is in the Christian bloodstream with such intensity because the slave population had the audacity to overthrow their white, Christian (French Catholic) overlords thus upsetting the will of God. The world is still making Haiti pay for this sin with economic pain
950051816435105792 2018-01-07 17:09:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @toddheathen Hey Todd! Thanks for the recommendation! Sadly, there's so much to laugh at it makes out job pretty easy!
949870871195271168 2018-01-06 05:10:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose If you want to know it you will feel it. You've already seen it in your dreams. Can't you feel it? - Thats what it's about.
949867325779423232 2018-01-06 04:56:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose *too
949867196028567553 2018-01-06 04:56:01 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose The book is awful, but the movie is to. Here's the Rotten Tomatoes review-https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_celestine_prophecy/
949865275729444864 2018-01-06 04:48:24 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose NOT Celeste! Celestine! Have you not heard of that crowning achievement of New Age dreck? If not, count yourself among the lucky!
949861964611600384 2018-01-06 04:35:14 UTC <howtoheretic> Did ya'll know there is a movie version of the Celestine Prophecy? Aye aye aye what a train wreck!https://vimeo.com/153145733

949134267795218432 2018-01-04 04:23:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Enjoy? No dear god it's unbearable. But if it helps with the figs, I ain't stopping (I really hope you've listened to the episode prior to this tweet)
949133613206917126 2018-01-04 04:21:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Might? Is currently.
949133061089710081 2018-01-04 04:18:50 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Wait until you hear the stories! I hope you're not shy about people putting human finger bones up their butts!
949111686425800704 2018-01-04 02:53:54 UTC <howtoheretic> @mrjessewalker @JAdomian The fact that two of America's most awful villains knew each other, one abandoned the other, and now that same oaf pines for the one he left to to die seems exactly the obvious history that lead the moment.
949093198407745536 2018-01-04 01:40:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @filmystic This whole episode is like if Shakespeare were the showrunner for Married with Children. Epic melodrama acted by hapless, garbage halfwits.
948994051461672966 2018-01-04 19:06:27 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG brilliant!
948968307788427265 2018-01-04 17:24:10 UTC <howtoheretic> Haha! Thanks @ToriGlass ! Thats why we do what we do! A little laughter through the tears!https://twitter.com/ToriGlass/status/948966282178670594
948965273914101761 2018-01-04 17:12:06 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Yeah Tori it's pretty crazy. Not sure if it's still the operative theory about the Anasazi  disappearance but it seems the evidence is pretty solid. Yikes!
948796732699127808 2018-01-03 06:02:23 UTC <howtoheretic> @doughofeling @_andrewwang I just followed you
948796617146081280 2018-01-03 06:01:55 UTC <howtoheretic> @doughofeling @_andrewwang Absolutely! DM me Andrew
948796090530189313 2018-01-03 05:59:50 UTC <howtoheretic> @doughofeling @_andrewwang I would ask you back, how much do you know about it's foundation? Have you read outside the accepted cannon?
948795818928087040 2018-01-03 05:58:45 UTC <howtoheretic> @doughofeling @_andrewwang Glad you asked Andrew. I was Mormon for 20+ years of my life. My entire family still is save on brother. I still live adjacent to it. I have read more about it after my leaving than when I was in. With respect Andrew, I may know more about it than the average Mormon.
948794895900188679 2018-01-03 05:55:05 UTC <howtoheretic> @doughofeling @_andrewwang If you want a fun and welcoming place to hear critiques of all religions and bad ideas, check out my podcast Andrew!https://howtoheretic.com/podcast
948793901439107072 2018-01-03 05:51:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @doughofeling @_andrewwang And if you want more anti-LGBTQ stuff, we can explore genital electro-shock torture practiced against perfectly normal gay men and women at BYU into the 1980's. And the fact that God's Utah has the highest teen suicide rate in the US. Let me know.
948793212625305601 2018-01-03 05:48:24 UTC <howtoheretic> @doughofeling @_andrewwang That is just a sniff of recent Mormon anti LGBTQ actions - on which they spent tens of millions of dollars - and lost. Once you take some time to educate yourself on this subject, would you like to explore doctrinal racism? I'm here for you Andrew.
948792681135616000 2018-01-03 05:46:17 UTC <howtoheretic> @doughofeling @_andrewwang Andrew. I'm not your mom. It's your job to be informed, not mine to inform you. Google is a tool to do research on subject, such as: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/11/05/mormon-church-to-exclude-children-of-same-sex-couples-from-getting-blessed-and-baptized-until-they-are-18/?utm_term=.79de0e8d5dc7 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11992548/Mormon-anti-gay-rules-provoke-angry-backlash-from-rank-and-file.html http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html This is 15 seconds of searching.
948751626742857730 2018-01-03 03:03:09 UTC <howtoheretic> OK listen all you damned smarmy Washington State truthers! It's YELM, not YELP. Whatever. Like I'm soooo clear on the eastern shore of stupid Lemuria! Gall!
948746536992714753 2018-01-03 02:42:55 UTC <howtoheretic> @hemantmehta Trump doesn't know what 'Compassion', 'Mormon', 'Prophet' or 'Marriage' mean. So it's like anything else he ever says.
948745433681031173 2018-01-03 02:38:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @pedantic_dan OK I f-cked that up. In my defense, how many skeptics outside of Utah can pronounce 'Moroni'? Even the great Hitchens cocked it up. But I shall make a correction this week. And furthermore -  Its Yelp
948744295187546113 2018-01-03 02:34:01 UTC <howtoheretic> @skeptoid Hey Skeptoid! It's @howtoheretic here! We're looking to do a segment about how to talk to believers about evolution. Y'all interested in helping us out? Please tweet back or DM and we'll do this!
948739600150814720 2018-01-03 02:15:22 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn @doughofeling Wait wait wait! Prest was just going on about how his beliefs must never be questioned, but had a whole stem-winder about how gay people are born defective and so it's ok to deny them basic human rights. Prest, are you there? Is this thing on?
948732344248094721 2018-01-03 01:46:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn And while I appreciate you not wanting any examination of anyone's beliefs because that's absurd, I feel like you were about to launch into an examination of the flaws of the brains/beings of God' homosexual children? You have the floor Prest-
948731835923640320 2018-01-03 01:44:30 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn And actually the study and critique of forces and institutions in society - religion (with an 'i') - is not only interesting but critical and not absurd (with and 'a'). The word is full of good ideas and bad, examining them objectively the job of all of us.
948731187505242113 2018-01-03 01:41:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn And absurd is spelled with an 'a'
948731005560500224 2018-01-03 01:41:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn Apologies, the PDF would not attach, here is a link.  https://cesletter.org/
948730763062665216 2018-01-03 01:40:15 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn And in my years inside, outside and adjacent to 'your religion' I might know a tad more than you would think. This isn't my work, but the attached PDF might be helpful as entry level inquiry into 'your religion'
948729931608936448 2018-01-03 01:36:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn Oh boy Prest. OK, one thing at a time. I don't have full knowledge of anything, including 'your relgion'. It was mine for 20 years, and I critique it part time on a super fun podcast you might want to check out -  https://howtoheretic.com/podcast
948729495413972992 2018-01-03 01:35:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn I'm extremely interested in your division between belief (as you say, everything you do) and non-belief, I guess meaning - what? - Everything else, like genetics, physics - a little lost here.
948729035516817408 2018-01-03 01:33:23 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn Ah! So you're being, your sexuality Prest is just 'belief' as well? Meaning it's not your nature, you chose it? Can you remember when you chose to be straight? I mean I want to 'accept' you.
948728600236244993 2018-01-03 01:31:39 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn Homosexuality, like your (I assume) heterosexuality are innate and unchangeable parts of all our nature's. So deciding whether or not you 'accept' the nature of some one's being is not actually 'acceptance'. It's the opposite.
948727784913829888 2018-01-03 01:28:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn It's not beliefs Prest. Those are a choice. People change their belief's every day. If beliefs weren't a choice why do the Mormons send out tens of thousands of kids every year to change people's beliefs? To convince them to choose new ones.
948726834463567873 2018-01-03 01:24:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn What was made up, Prest? The fight over Prop 8 in California? The hideous policy punishing the children whose sin is having gay parents? Which is a grotesque violation of your own 2nd article of faith? What is made up?
948726190256242689 2018-01-03 01:22:04 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn Also, how are you 'accepting of everyone' if you feel that they may not form legally recognized partnerships based on love, but you may, because.....reasons? This is not 'accepting of everyone', this is ignorance.
948725669118160897 2018-01-03 01:20:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn OK now you have strayed further from the assertion that he did nothing to harm innocent children. Now you have ventured into a discussion of gender. Which is separate from procreation and sexuality. I think you need a liahona to find your way out of this thicket Prest.
948724904077111296 2018-01-03 01:16:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn You inferred the singling out children was made up. Now you've moved past it to say it doesn't matter? And what do you know about my dad?
948716503314055168 2018-01-03 00:43:35 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn Prest, I'm not your mom, it's your job to be informed. Do better.  https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/us/mormons-set-to-quit-church-over-policy-on-gay-couples-and-their-children.html?_r=0  And how much money did 'he' give to children? 2 billion - no that was a for profit mall.
948705933504348160 2018-01-03 00:01:35 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis @prehstuhn Great, love him. No one else is required to. His death doesn't immunize him from criticism for a long fight against the civil rights of members and non-members, from singling out vulnerable children for "sins" they did not commit and promoting harmful myths.
948702037398532096 2018-01-03 23:46:06 UTC <howtoheretic> @skeptoid @calypsoh13 *if
948701698851155968 2018-01-03 23:44:45 UTC <howtoheretic> @skeptoid @calypsoh13 Oh wow thats brilliant! What an interesting pitfall to have to figure out how to avoid. Seems impossible of the stealth religious quacks are acting in bad faith. A documentary is a fantastic idea!
948693240332472320 2018-01-03 23:11:09 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop His Illustrations ARE AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Look at the ones from Stangelove - ugh I die.
948691783596179456 2018-01-03 23:05:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop One of production designer Ken Adams masterpieces. Masterpieces were all he was capable of making.
948690989484421120 2018-01-03 23:02:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop More Moonraker, actually.
948690437841154048 2018-01-03 23:00:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop No doubt he is monitoring the situation from Moon Station Zebra. He will make his move when we least expect it.
948669335634984960 2018-01-03 21:36:09 UTC <howtoheretic> We talked extremely negatively about him when he was alive as well.
948669191753576449 2018-01-03 21:35:35 UTC <howtoheretic> Monson actively applied his power and the considerable financial resources of the church to the fight against gay people inside and outside his church, going so far as to single children of gays out for abuse. Kind? I suppose if you're fortunate not to be gay.
948663128379633664 2018-01-03 21:11:29 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis Happy to hear you out. But beliefs are just ideas, and ideas are to be examined, no matter how sacred anybody thinks they are, mine, yours everyone's. Monson was the face of a set of absurd, pernicious and damaging beliefs. He didn't have to be that, he chose to be.
948661121552019456 2018-01-03 21:03:31 UTC <howtoheretic> @kennnna_mathis I'm a former Mormon and professional atheist who has a podcast for people trying to escape religion. Lack of thought and research are religious habits, not ours Ken. Here's a link to our show - enjoy!https://howtoheretic.com/podcast/
948646481367515136 2018-01-03 20:05:20 UTC <howtoheretic> @_andrewwang Uh, sure dude. He was super helpful.
948588673397702656 2018-01-03 16:15:38 UTC <howtoheretic> Hey there Heretics! Ep#15 - Of Lemurs, Ditches and Figs - is up and running for the teeming masses! Enjoy the wisdom of a drunken master and the tale of Cardinal Richelieu's unfortunate bottom!
948584477889937408 2018-01-03 15:58:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny And to you Hadar!!
948455750916976640 2018-01-02 07:27:27 UTC <howtoheretic> @g1rad This garbage person caused his own death by being an idiot in the deliberate pursuit of doing something despicable. How sad is anyone supposed to be?
948451762645565440 2018-01-02 07:11:36 UTC <howtoheretic> Prophet, Seer, Revelator, CEO of Mormon Inc. Thomas S. Monson is dead. We do hope the Brethren can locate another cruel, homophobic, misogynistic, unreconstructed racist, octogenarian white theocrat to carry on his work.
947885048044298240 2018-01-01 17:39:40 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics of 2018! Ep#15 - Of Lemurs, Ditches and Figs - Is alive and kicking for patrons! Come hear the drunken wonders of an ice aged warrior, enjoy a hospital where no girls are allowed, and hear why cannibals may be bad additions to your neighborhood!
947884250157555713 2018-01-01 17:36:30 UTC <howtoheretic> @elibosnick @sparastino Thank you Sam! Eli is amazing and issues of mental health are totally normal. No shame, no guilt, just take your damned medication!
947714777987432448 2017-12-31 06:23:05 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Happy New Year Tori!
947714393965395968 2017-12-31 06:21:33 UTC <howtoheretic> To our young friends, old friends and good people who may be isolated, alone and feeling friendless - you're not crazy, you're not sinful, and you're not alone. There's a better world after religion, where you are free to be who you choose to be! 2018
947712999355068416 2017-12-31 06:16:01 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass AAHHH! Thats the birthdate of the How-To Heretic podcast! Uncle Mark was born on Oct 24th, Uncle Dan was born sometime in July. But the 10th is our pod's Bday!
947711856063406081 2017-12-31 06:11:28 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Wait what Tori?
947702167942471680 2017-12-31 05:32:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass KILL OR BE KILLED!!!!!
947702048086097920 2017-12-31 05:32:30 UTC <howtoheretic> Our beloved Heretics! We are survivors, we are brilliant, we are legion! 2018 is going to be rough. Let's love more, learn more and leave no one behind! We'll get through the next year together!
947700755653214208 2017-12-31 05:27:22 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Hahaha! Love back! Let's 2018 the fuck out of the next year!
947698309463810048 2017-12-31 05:17:39 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Gorgeous Tori! Science and learning gave you the ability to see infinity. What does religion offer that's more beautiful than that? Happy New Year!
947697267707846658 2017-12-31 05:13:30 UTC <howtoheretic> @brchastain Congrats Blake! You guys are doing amazing work!
947696535352909824 2017-12-31 05:10:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop Happy New Year to you Chris and all your good people! We honestly predict 2018 is going to be epic, historic and nightmarish. Strap in, be brave and know that together we will topple this garbage regime. It will not be pretty, but it will be worth it! VICTORY!!
947586481639473152 2017-12-31 21:53:17 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Need science answers? They're all right there in the Bible!
946960716493307904 2017-12-29 04:26:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Ha! Our gift to you!
946919981920305152 2017-12-29 01:44:51 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Not yet! Maybe for a passover special!
946918059704332290 2017-12-29 01:37:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Well if the Bible tells us anything there are 5 more, even weirder plagues to follow. Baton don the hatches Tori!
946915517633196033 2017-12-29 01:27:06 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass What happened? Big wind storm?
946913476735143936 2017-12-29 01:19:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Gad Zooks! Everyone OK? Trees, they're always trying to kill us!
946910971989078016 2017-12-29 01:09:03 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Random memory rabbit-hole request! Living in LA in the early 90's, there was a bizarre old Dutch or German guy that was a new age guru on public access TV - he would preach as he sat cross-legged on a rotating platform. It was incredible! Anyone else recall this?
946866253498499072 2017-12-29 22:11:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @ArchimedesScroo Ah. Then I should hurry and call the police back.
946865222131650560 2017-12-29 22:07:15 UTC <howtoheretic> @ArchimedesScroo I'm sorry, you failed to make clear to whom it belongs.
946781238408261632 2017-12-29 16:33:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Thank you Tori!
946781065099714560 2017-12-29 16:32:50 UTC <howtoheretic> @SarahTalkRadio Ooooh  excellent! We've been searching for one! I'll give it a listen today!
946650545229402112 2017-12-28 07:54:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @jonjones Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you-
946641451240210432 2017-12-28 07:18:04 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny Well earned! It just gets better from here. Happy birthday Hadar!
946640786589827073 2017-12-28 07:15:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny Thats a solid landmark. It means you've survived your 20's and have graduated into a wonderful adulthood. I say this to you as a person closing in on 50. Enjoy this!
946639908306763776 2017-12-28 07:11:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny I do not!
946639067243876352 2017-12-28 07:08:35 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny Ohhh! Happy birthday Hadar! 21 at last!
946638879351701504 2017-12-28 07:07:51 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Well, despite all the garbage and idiocy of our youth, here we are person to person on stupid twitter. I value this platform, which at it's best allows us all to create family and reach out to salve each other's wounds. The needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many.
946636210629255169 2017-12-28 06:57:14 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny The Israeli Carmen Miranda. We approve!
946634241734975488 2017-12-28 06:49:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @jonjones I give too much. Its nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.
946629146142052355 2017-12-28 06:29:10 UTC <howtoheretic> @jonjones Here is the best deconstruction of The Rains Down in Africa ever. Is it pretty song? Absolutely. Is it deeply problematic? My dear lord yes! Enjoy!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2aGe8_Ag0
946614892693303298 2017-12-28 05:32:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Enjoy your youth! I had fundie (albeit Mormon fundie) parents. We had TV because they needed to be plugged into every permutation of black/brown people's offenses against Yankee Doodle white supremacy. Sometimes I could watch Star Trek.
946611631978508289 2017-12-28 05:19:34 UTC <howtoheretic> Love and welcome to yet more friends and followers from the @C_Stroop universe! We at The How-To Heretic wish to build a community of sanity and safe harbor for the tempest-tossed survivors of full-spectrum religious bullshit. Won't you join us?
946610709885894658 2017-12-28 05:15:55 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Friend you are young and I love it! Mine is the Iranian hostage crisis.
946604960648536064 2017-12-28 04:53:04 UTC <howtoheretic> Think you know Christmas? We thought we did too. Check out the four unrelated Biblical Christmas stories in Ep#13 of the How-To Heretic. It's a serious disaster. Thanks for the shout-out @SarahTalkRadiohttps://twitter.com/SarahTalkRadio/status/946587821296451584
946594991727452161 2017-12-28 04:13:27 UTC <howtoheretic> Thank you @SarahTalkRadio ! Even I was surprised by what a shit show the 4 disconnected Nativity stories are. Just goes to show that nobody who believes the Beeble has ever read it. Enjoy all!
946419559472361475 2017-12-28 16:36:21 UTC <howtoheretic> Thank you Dr Stroop! It's a joy to be part of a growing community for sanity and reason is a world in desperate need of both! And we look forward to your next appearance on the Heretic - #RaptureAnxietyhttps://twitter.com/C_Stroop/status/946416847079034881

946253576568897536 2017-12-27 05:36:47 UTC <howtoheretic> A little extra for our Heretics, tomorrow is a rebroadcast of our appearance on the Great Doug Fabrizio's Radio West show. If you haven't heard it yet tune in at 9:00 am MST!http://radiowest.kuer.org/post/how-heretic-0
946139528128901120 2017-12-27 22:03:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose To be honest, I don't even Christmas - life is so much better without it ;)
946128708934410240 2017-12-27 21:20:37 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Breakfast with my man, watched the best Christmas movie ever (A Lion in Winter), then a boozy evening with friends!
946126647538851840 2017-12-27 21:12:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Better than that.
946088445306314753 2017-12-27 18:40:37 UTC <howtoheretic> @MrMMarsh @HRKenny Ohhhh! I want candy!
946085694652391425 2017-12-27 18:29:41 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny Good heavens it is the mighty @MrMMarsh inserting himself into our silly little Hebrew lesson Hadar! To what do we owe this auspicious appearance?
946041304672124928 2017-12-27 15:33:18 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny My god what you're sayin is that Uncle Dan was right? OMG he'll be insufferable.
946040933392424960 2017-12-27 15:31:49 UTC <howtoheretic> Okie Dokie Heretics! Ep#14 - Lying Liars and their 12 Tribes - is hot & fresh for everyone! Come meet hairy babies, Brother Nelson & Andrew Torrez of @openargs podcast!
945329174129999872 2017-12-25 16:23:33 UTC <howtoheretic> Merry Heresy! Ep#14- Lying Liars and their 12 Tribes - is ready for patrons to unwrap! We've got indentured servitude! We've got forced/trick marriages! We've got millennialist cult rock stars! We've got Andrew Torrez of @openargs ! How can you not be a patron?!
944994540452167680 2017-12-24 18:13:50 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtheistEclipse Thanks eclipse! I'll check these out!
944987883747753985 2017-12-24 17:47:23 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtheistEclipse I don't think I am following that particular profile. I'd be grateful if you were able to find it. No rush however!
944982827510128640 2017-12-24 17:27:17 UTC <howtoheretic> Yo Heretics! I'm trying to find a clear breakdown of Muslim/Koranic apologetics from an atheist/skeptical perspective (meaning not from an equally absurd Christian point of view). Preferably not a massive book (I'm busy and not too smart). Any ideas?
944827338188931072 2017-12-23 07:09:26 UTC <howtoheretic> We at the How-To Heretic know that this time of year can be tough and lonely for those that have left religion. But take heart that Roy Moore isn't in the senate, and Melania Trump is the national Christmas ice vampire. But seriously, much love from your audio uncles!
944698914971648000 2017-12-23 22:39:07 UTC <howtoheretic> @calypsoh13 I believe you are 100% correct. So many of these pointless messes we are in as a society come from ancient or outdated garbage ideas about the roles of gender and sex, most of which are the product of religious nonsense. And it's almost 2018
944697817758494720 2017-12-23 22:34:46 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 And to you from us!
944360536812044288 2017-12-22 00:14:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @probablyforsale @adam1310uk Sometimes? Oof, get to know me better kid. I'm a full time disappointment.
944344715993825280 2017-12-22 23:11:40 UTC <howtoheretic> @probablyforsale @adam1310uk Alas I have yet to see the latest rebirth of the war among the stars. I'll check back in when I have!
944077814982090752 2017-12-21 05:31:05 UTC <howtoheretic> @UtahOutcasts By god yes lets do it. Dan and I are in Downtown SLC.
944069204474454017 2017-12-21 04:56:52 UTC <howtoheretic> @UtahOutcasts Why yes indeed we are!
944002260882702336 2017-12-21 00:30:52 UTC <howtoheretic> Fun subversive group activity- Has anyone ever gotten them to baptize fictional names? Herman Merman, Kylo Ren, John Smallberries, etc etc? Can this be done then publicized? What say ye @newnamenoah @UtahOutcasts ? Shall we offer a prize for first documented hijink?https://twitter.com/UtahOutcasts/status/943997613057114112
943998064724926464 2017-12-21 00:14:11 UTC <howtoheretic> @hemantmehta Pro-tip Hemant, there are no rules. In public for PR, sure! But behind closed doors, none at all.
943705081551101952 2017-12-20 04:49:59 UTC <howtoheretic> @NetSec_Dan From Prof K? She's an English prof at a university in UT. So I don't know what other work she might have to plug. I will for sure ask her for you though.
943620172144787456 2017-12-20 23:12:35 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname UNCLEAN!
943578417324179457 2017-12-20 20:26:40 UTC <howtoheretic> @ToriGlass Thanks Tori! It's extremely ridiculous, isn't it?
943549840268468224 2017-12-20 18:33:06 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny Exactly.
943547899228463105 2017-12-20 18:25:24 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny Makes sense. I think in the US most Christians are trained to look at it all too literally, so any symbolism or metaphor is invisible to them.
943545453974470656 2017-12-20 18:15:41 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny What a weird stroke of luck that the 'savior's' name would actually mean 'salvation'. Almost too sloppy for fiction. Oh well!
943545045369503744 2017-12-20 18:14:03 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny Somehow I think I knew that from the distant past actually. Good to know for future reference!
943542251430408192 2017-12-20 18:02:57 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny Hadar! Next time I'll recall your name when I'm suddenly confronted with a Hebrew pronunciation/context question, I swear! What about 'Jesus' or 'Jeshua'? After the Ham/Japeth/Noah thing it has me wondering....
943515899562139648 2017-12-20 16:18:14 UTC <howtoheretic> Hello the Heretics! Ep#13 - Flint sickles and Brass anvils and Myrrh - Is up for all the peoples of earth! Why have one Christmas story? Collect all 4! Then let's bury an old butthole and feel the need, the need to read!
943331896414543872 2017-12-19 04:07:05 UTC <howtoheretic> @elibosnick Usain Bolt is 6'-4" and 210. I'm sure Bill has the same build.
942942901478211584 2017-12-18 02:21:21 UTC <howtoheretic> I'm calling for a complete and total ban on the Hall of the Presidents until our representatives can figure out what the hell is going on with the new fat, illiterate robot that looks like late stage Walken.https://twitter.com/Moonglum/status/942883977253224450
942929485401174016 2017-12-18 01:28:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop Uncle Mark hisses - 'Good Chris, good. Now start a new Stroop brand hashtag, #giveallyourmoneytohowtoheretic and you'll be fine'  Chris Stroop - Shuddering, he struggles to tweet with the makeshift blindfold, the novelty handcuffs and the Tabernacle Choir blasting in his ears.
942927879351943168 2017-12-18 01:21:39 UTC <howtoheretic> We have abducted @C_Stroop and are holding him at gunpoint. He is so far cooperating with our demands for his endorsements. If y'all ever want to see him alive again, give The How-To Heretic 5 star reviews on everything or we'll rapture his college-boy ass! NOW!https://twitter.com/C_Stroop/status/942922026389590016
942779319528538112 2017-12-18 15:31:20 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Ep#13 - Flint sickles and Brass anvils and Myrrh - Is up now for Patrons! Become a patron today and get early access to our special Christmas story(s) and Professor K telling you what bad advice to ignore. And she's right!
942554537654599680 2017-12-17 00:38:08 UTC <howtoheretic> A big Heretic howdy to all our new followers and friends from the orbit of @C_Stroop glad to have you! You can check out our interview with the Dr himself at this link- Enjoy and happy heresy!https://howtoheretic.com/podcast/2017/11/29/010-cover-up-dad-youre-drunk-1
942449668205699072 2017-12-17 17:41:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @TheOnion @elibosnick AND it's vegan! My god the layers of meaning here....
942441076740067328 2017-12-17 17:07:17 UTC <howtoheretic> Hey @LeahRemini ! Groundbreaking, amazing work on your show! Brilliant that you want to expand it to other groups. A couple ex-Mormon podcasters in Utah would love to talk to you or @MikeRinder about your fearless advocacy. Cheers!https://twitter.com/SethAndrewsTTA/status/942437172866617345
942423472755503104 2017-12-17 15:57:19 UTC <howtoheretic> If you're not following Christopher Stroop and his work, please do so. #EmptyThePews & #RaptureAnxiety are fascinating conversations about the damage fundamentalism does. Thanks again good Dr Stroop!https://twitter.com/C_Stroop/status/942405813712375811
942414006966304768 2017-12-17 15:19:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @hannahpaasch @emilyjoypoetry @hemantmehta @noshamemov @seelolago @examinereligion @aejohnsonphd @C_Stroop Thank you Christopher! It's an honor to be included in such fantastic company! We'll continue to be inspired by the work you do!
941931135831105536 2017-12-15 07:20:57 UTC <howtoheretic> @MassHysteria3 @OfficialJonZal More like he was born in the Skybox and thinks he nailed a 7th quarter hat-trick from the 3 point line in extra innings #MAGA
941843704003706880 2017-12-15 01:33:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @elibosnick CAN'T WE ALL AGREE ON ONE DAY'S TRUCE ON F-CKING LIFE DAY AND WISH FOR PEACE ON KASHYKK? This war on Life Day is a real bummer, guys.  (this tweet was deleted and corrected for a massive spelling fail. Apologies)
941841978727194625 2017-12-15 01:26:40 UTC <howtoheretic> @UtahOutcasts Well when you were born in the Nile valley in the Old Kingdom, and have been cursed by Anubis to wander the earth forever in shrieking agony in endless cycles of life and death, you have the experience to speak with authority #CursedAnn
941430054537478144 2017-12-14 22:09:50 UTC <howtoheretic> @LorraineNorthw4 @LiamJJPearce @MilesHolderUK @LiamP_100 @ellietheking #1 - @adam1310uk
941352553144451072 2017-12-14 17:01:52 UTC <howtoheretic> @AndrewLSeidel Quick! Someone dredge up whats left of Bin Laden's body and resuscitate him! These Obama catastrophes must be undone!
941170860664143874 2017-12-13 04:59:53 UTC <howtoheretic> @elibosnick @slippy83 GASP! We should all be so lucky!
941136050289745920 2017-12-13 02:41:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose May angels guide you to your rest! Be well Rose!
941132465074159617 2017-12-13 02:27:19 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Our jobs are heresy-ing, blasphemery and hexenwerk of every type. And we are in the great state of Utah. Where sickness fears to tread because of the blinding whiteness of a perfected society. If you must know Rose.
941131773609512960 2017-12-13 02:24:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname This we know. But that amazing skill is lost to all but the saltiest Polynesian seafarers. The rest of us are lucky if we can work out weird-ass brass antiques while simultaneously being able to see the stars.
941131066517069826 2017-12-13 02:21:46 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Heresy never sleeps
941130786211733504 2017-12-13 02:20:39 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Have you tired prayer?
941069689152618496 2017-12-13 22:17:52 UTC <howtoheretic> @RudyHellzapop It's actually extraordinary. A mess? Maybe, but an epically envisioned mess.
941059232815726592 2017-12-13 21:36:19 UTC <howtoheretic> @martingeddes Ha! Actually emailing you now!
941055512258347008 2017-12-13 21:21:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @elibosnick @slippy83 Dear cousin Eli. Not sure how we're related, but we let him ride bikes with us anyway.
941038704721764352 2017-12-13 20:14:45 UTC <howtoheretic> @martingeddes Follow me back so I can DM you Martin- Thanks!
941034859824156672 2017-12-13 19:59:28 UTC <howtoheretic> A million thanks to all our patrons who stuck with us during Patreon's bad brown acid trip. Your support and feedback are everything to us. Now, back to the heresy!!
941029970662408192 2017-12-13 19:40:03 UTC <howtoheretic> @revolutionwifi @martingeddes @C_Stroop Yeah Martin - we're looking for an in to the Ex-JW community. We feel like thats a conversation lacking in the skeptical podverse. Thanks Christopher as always!
941003852676870144 2017-12-13 17:56:16 UTC <howtoheretic> @RandyLaMonda Oh my dear Lord YESSS! We'll do a whole thing about those! They are a very underreported and under-examined bit of Mormon soothsaying!
940964505755967488 2017-12-13 15:19:55 UTC <howtoheretic> OK Heretics! Ep#12 - Zodiac Shmodiac - With Eli Bosnick - is available for our adoring public! Don't miss @elibosnick dishing on the other kids at theater camp! Its juicy!
940801094195740676 2017-12-12 04:30:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @hemantmehta @bazecraze I can just picture Roy Moore's face when his Jewish lawyer told him that black people are actually allowed to vote in 2017.
940799818229837826 2017-12-12 04:25:30 UTC <howtoheretic> @AmericanAtheist It worked with 100% the same efficacy as all other prayers, thank you very much!
940793646110056448 2017-12-12 04:00:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @elibosnick OMG NOW I HAVE TO BE NICE TO ALABAMA??!!!! I accept this new world we live in. Nothing but love for our sisters and brothers in Alabama! Fuckin' A guys!
940641642981105664 2017-12-12 17:56:58 UTC <howtoheretic> Pity the oppressed majority.https://twitter.com/C_Stroop/status/940639357043724288
940615284305444864 2017-12-12 16:12:14 UTC <howtoheretic> @elibosnick @Learning1_270 Thanks L1, Eli is amazingly funny, so hearing his serious side is pretty fascinating.
940244330706382848 2017-12-11 15:38:11 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Ep#12- Zodiac Schmodiac - with Eli Bosnick - is alive and kicking for patrons now! Whats your sign? No f-ck you you're wrong! And hear @elibosnick talk about his misty watercolored memories of a very Jewy youth! Why not become a patron today?
939988747101265920 2017-12-10 22:42:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @ChrisEvans Dude! You just made my day!
939622934829711360 2017-12-09 22:28:59 UTC <howtoheretic> Christopher, we have a different take on #RaptureAnxiety - We are getting super impatient for the sanctimonious holier-than-thou Christian scolds to achieve their magic lift-off and leave the rest of us alone to build a better world. Any help for us? Love from The How-To Heretic!https://twitter.com/C_Stroop/status/939618007617277952
939372617743478784 2017-12-08 05:54:19 UTC <howtoheretic> @MyFavMurder @PattioJames Pence! You SHOULD feel bad! However Utah has shit out Orrin Hatch, Mike Lee and Jason Caffetz. So don't feel too bad Tyler. We all have the red state blues.
939316370306580480 2017-12-08 02:10:48 UTC <howtoheretic> @MyFavMurder @PattioJames Sounds fun! I'll give it a listen. How's Indiana? (thats where you are, right?)
939315303346946048 2017-12-08 02:06:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @MyFavMurder @PattioJames I don't know that show - what is it? Should I give it a listen? And yes I think maybe in the next year or so we might give it a go! On our appearances page you can hear our live haranguing of a bad mormon movie on the live Gamcast.
939308666653523968 2017-12-08 01:40:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @Rhiana_leigh11 @ProPandaPanda Thank you for your service.
939305318852341762 2017-12-08 01:26:54 UTC <howtoheretic> Uncle Mark here! Huge thanks to Frank at @tgiatheist for letting me fill in on this weeks TGIA for that no good so-and-so Uncle Dan. If you haven't had enough of sanctimonious Christian sex criminal Roy Moore yet, this is the episode for you. Love ya Frank!
939167184760143878 2017-12-08 16:18:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @lion_bronze Wise words! As you know, when leaving religion that which was forbidden can become a little bit of a problem.
938965684096135168 2017-12-07 02:57:18 UTC <howtoheretic> @ProPandaPanda @AtheistEclipse If y'all would like a copy of a 3rd testament of Christ on earth, plz forward your addresses. I can have two nice young men on your doorsteps in under and hour. You're so welcome!
938951415422107648 2017-12-07 02:00:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @ProPandaPanda Hi Luke, Uncle Mark here, I can help. These answers can be found in the Book of Mormon. These sloths hooked a ride on wooden submarines from the Holy Land to America that sailed without propulsion and with corks in the top and bottom. It's all in the book.
938950744731987970 2017-12-07 01:57:57 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop If it wasn't for schadenfreude I would feel nothing at all. Does that make me bad? I'm good with it.
938833547036475393 2017-12-07 18:12:14 UTC <howtoheretic> Great discussion about the absurd Christian cake case in front of SCOTUS on Scathing Atheist with @Noah_Lugeons, @heathenwright and @patorrezlaw of @openargs - the world's gone mad but it helps to laugh at the insanity. Thanks guys!

938135053619683328 2017-12-05 19:56:41 UTC <howtoheretic> @therealEmmaHale @SampsonAvard Cleary they find even being in the presence of photographs of black deeply uncomfortable.

937710192019386368 2017-12-04 15:48:26 UTC <howtoheretic> Hey Heretics! Ep# 11 - Gaining a Heart but Losing a Head - is live for Patrons NOW! Wanna know why this chair is more important internationally than you are? Become a patron right now and find out!pic.twitter.com/6eJIwExKvR
937357420321415169 2017-12-03 16:26:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop WTF is he talking about? Jared was 'in charge' for 5 minutes, and now Kellyanne? All this while every expert on everything has either been fired or fled this dumpster fire administration?

Check out our chat with here here- http://incitingincident.libsyn.com/119-uncle-dan-uncle-mark-the-how-to-heretic-podcast Thank you Marissa! We'll try to make SLC a more welcoming place in time for your next visit!
936334749966024704 2017-11-30 20:42:55 UTC <howtoheretic> You beat the odds fellas, congrats!! Here's to 250 more!!!https://twitter.com/elibosnick/status/936318148025946113
936290909141942272 2017-11-30 17:48:42 UTC <howtoheretic> @EllaGellaE @HRKenny You can be our go-to Hebrew!
936288136606269441 2017-11-30 17:37:41 UTC <howtoheretic> @EllaGellaE @HRKenny We already did Lot and his daughters (I dread knowing the Hebrew subtext there- yikes!) and Elisha and the bears - also a barrel of laughs. We covered the prohibition on weasels in Leviticus (don't tell me weasel means something even more f-ed up?)
936281668247154688 2017-11-30 17:11:59 UTC <howtoheretic> @EllaGellaE @HRKenny Hot, Handsome and Comfortable?! You're joking! That is amazing! Sounds like a law firm on Arrested Development!
936255744021630976 2017-11-30 15:28:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny Wait what? Hot and Handsome saw Noah (dying to know what that means!) naked! Sounds like a movie Uncle Mark would like!
936065340236111873 2017-11-29 02:52:23 UTC <howtoheretic> @Nyckname Uh, if you say so.
936011498790326273 2017-11-29 23:18:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @astaiannymph Look at the brains on Theo! Yeah it's a pretty fascinating dive into reconstructing language/culture/history. I'd love more info on the PIE if you have it Theo.
936001634932482048 2017-11-29 22:39:14 UTC <howtoheretic> If you're not following Dr Christopher Stroop at @C_Stroop you're missing out. The ex-Evangelical angle on recovering from religion is fascinating and insightful. We were delighted to have him on our show! #EmptyThePewshttps://twitter.com/C_Stroop/status/935995393996984322
936001015228243968 2017-11-29 22:36:46 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop Thanks Christopher! It was lovely to have you and we hope some of your good people might find some help, some hope and a few laughs over at http://www.howtoheretic.com, our little corner of the internet!
935912479711883264 2017-11-29 16:44:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @Keithtimber Indeed, in a book chock full of stupid and terrible stories it is among the stupidest.
935895550964019200 2017-11-29 15:37:42 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Ep #10 - Cover Up Dad, You're Drunk - is up for all the people! Among other delights, we are joined by Dr Christopher Stroop @C_Stroop who we try to help #EmptyThePews - Give it a listen!
935572424996696064 2017-11-28 18:13:42 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 He had a series where he put people together who had serious enmity. I think he won an Emmy for that episode.
935552417264893952 2017-11-28 16:54:12 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 Sperlock is great. The piece he did years ago with the anti-immigrant fanatic that then spent time with an undocumented family was amazing. I'll check it out!
935537284249559043 2017-11-28 15:54:04 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 Never heard of it.
935239985992626176 2017-11-27 20:12:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @adam1310uk Our cup doth runneth over, indeed.
935239794199707650 2017-11-27 20:11:57 UTC <howtoheretic> @adam1310uk But really it's a weird holiday celebrating a bunch of pale religious bigots being saved by generous Native Americans that the bigots would soon endeavor to wipe out entirely.
935239244397756416 2017-11-27 20:09:46 UTC <howtoheretic> @adam1310uk Ah you see they were thankful because nearly freezing/starving to death in the Plymouth colony was preferable to one more minute in England ;)
935215252072939521 2017-11-27 18:34:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @nocheez17 Paige is for sure going to be a regular guest. He not only counsels a ton of people through faith crisis, he went through one himself. He knows his shit!
935211934948798464 2017-11-27 18:21:15 UTC <howtoheretic> Taking the easy way out ;)https://twitter.com/IrreverendW/status/935211694099451904
935210767669805057 2017-11-27 18:16:37 UTC <howtoheretic> Hey Heretics! Were any of y'all able to put Paige's Thanksgiving survival tips (Ep #8) to work this year? Any good news to report? Anybody throw a plate?
935208099190677504 2017-11-27 18:06:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 We certainly aim to. What part of the world are you in?
935185997033177088 2017-11-27 16:38:11 UTC <howtoheretic> Why not become a patron today, and get the good news from Dr. Christopher Stroop @C_Stroop today? Just for one buck!
935185109761736704 2017-11-27 16:34:39 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop WHY ARE YOU SO DIFFICULT??!!
935184520650752000 2017-11-27 16:32:19 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop Our bad! I shall amend!
935183828443832326 2017-11-27 16:29:34 UTC <howtoheretic> Minor correction, Chris Stroop @C_Stroop joins us to #EmptyThePews ! There, thats better!
935183448808943616 2017-11-27 16:28:03 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Ep #10 - Cover up Dad, You're Drunk - is now available for Patrons! Find out why seeing your dad naked makes whole new races of people, and Christopher Stroop @C_Stroop joins us to #emptythepews
934836530220109826 2017-11-26 17:29:31 UTC <howtoheretic> @UtahOutcasts How dare you besmirch the artistry and narrative genius of Estes Pirkle!
934586431715950592 2017-11-25 00:55:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @C_Stroop Chris you can fight the good fight with half your brain tied behind your back! Be well Chris we'll record tomorrow when you're at 100%!
934220694757371904 2017-11-24 00:42:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @Benny34250184 YASS!!! Let us know what you think!
934216153592864768 2017-11-24 00:24:22 UTC <howtoheretic> @Benny34250184 Enjoy!
934215266526883841 2017-11-24 00:20:51 UTC <howtoheretic> @Benny34250184 Try searching without "the". Just How-To Heretic. It's there.
934214640988430336 2017-11-24 00:18:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @Benny34250184 Frank? *gasp*. It's Mark here! I shall forgive you this once, Benny. It can be found on our website- http://howtoheretic.com, and I know it's on itunes. Not sure what the issue with Stitcher is but I shall soon! Thanks for listening!
934212644352880640 2017-11-24 00:10:25 UTC <howtoheretic> @Benny34250184 I thought we were on it. Let me investigate!
933829189743947776 2017-11-23 22:46:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @merseyskeptics @mikehall314 @HRKenny @tuxcomputers Let the man eat his damned dinner!
933762733022969856 2017-11-23 18:22:38 UTC <howtoheretic> We had a great time talking to @Noah_Lugeons on The Scathing Atheist! Thanks for inviting us on for some holiday heresy!
933761751253901312 2017-11-23 18:18:44 UTC <howtoheretic> @RisMcCool Same here! Have a safe and happy day, however you celebrate or don't!
933761550627696640 2017-11-23 18:17:56 UTC <howtoheretic> @merseyskeptics @tuxcomputers @mikehall314 Thanks Mike! I shall once I get through the day with houseguests and turkey madness!
933744204781568000 2017-11-23 17:09:01 UTC <howtoheretic> @mikehall314 @merseyskeptics @tuxcomputers We shall investigate at once! Thanks for the info!
933743858931851265 2017-11-23 17:07:38 UTC <howtoheretic> OK American Heretics! Remember Paige's advice today - -consider why you're going to dinner, bring your best self, don't take the bait and use your genius to take the room back from the brink. Oh and bring a paper Pilgrim for the kids to smash! Good luck all!
933741130780307458 2017-11-23 16:56:48 UTC <howtoheretic> Thank you so much @RisMcCool of Inciting Incident for inviting us on to blather about who knows what! It was a great time!
933617752132034560 2017-11-23 08:46:32 UTC <howtoheretic> @HRKenny We can barley pronounce English! We thank you for being tolerant of our Old Testament fumblings. That said, tell us what your weasel vs owl consumption is. Salvation is still possible.
933541092116463616 2017-11-22 03:41:55 UTC <howtoheretic> Seconded. As such an orphan myself, I encourage you to build your own tribe and retake any holiday for yourself, with humor and creativity. There is great power in reclaiming what is denied you on your own terms!https://twitter.com/boldatheism/status/933534383725858816
933392192982282241 2017-11-22 17:50:15 UTC <howtoheretic> @lockey121 THANK YOU for such kind, encouraging words Jessica! Have you found our sophomoric antics helpful?
933354086270771200 2017-11-22 15:18:49 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Ep #9 - Owl Creatures Great and Small - is up for all the people! Andrew Torrez of @openargs joins us, and we explore all that is forbidden in Leviticus just in time for Thanksgiving!
933210644668669952 2017-11-21 05:48:50 UTC <howtoheretic> @sctbrdy This is ground control to Major Dumb
933155267008544768 2017-11-21 02:08:47 UTC <howtoheretic> @SethAndrewsTTA This will be one small splat for man, one giant misstep for mankind.
932813520126611456 2017-11-20 03:30:48 UTC <howtoheretic> @Browns @uspatrick May your torment with sport-balls and Dan's wrestling with the demon PCP (& Cinnabon. & Ketamine. & Prance-er-cize. & Jiffy-Pop. And Braille pornography. & Welsh men's choral music. & Seismography & Tectonic Journal collecting) come to a satisfactory end.
932755920878047232 2017-11-20 23:41:55 UTC <howtoheretic> Well put! Very germane to Episode #9 - Owl Creatures Great and Small - of the How-To Heretic. We break down all the rules in Leviticus Christians ignore as well as the one they demand gay people obey. Won't you join us?https://twitter.com/AtheistRepublic/status/932741720772620289
932755131635863553 2017-11-20 23:38:47 UTC <howtoheretic> @uspatrick Dan's struggle with PCP is a day to day journey. We appreciate our public's patience with his 'behavior' durning this difficult time. #WeLoveMarkMore.
932738136374784000 2017-11-20 22:31:15 UTC <howtoheretic> @uspatrick THAT WAS DAN! I TRIED TO STOP HIM! WHY DOES HE HATE CLEVELAND?!
932728529418043392 2017-11-20 21:53:05 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtomicDaydreams Hahaha! Awesome! You'll LOVE Ep #9 then. And yes the mayonnaise - Narakka and Mormon heave aside, I can never understand how poorly thought out most 'heaven' concepts are, and how often they seem a lot like hell once examined.
932725164344713216 2017-11-20 21:39:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtomicDaydreams Procrastination is the kind of sin that can buy you 53 trillion years in hell getting your balls frozen off, Oliver ;)
932724791324192768 2017-11-20 21:38:14 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtomicDaydreams Ha! Don't be sorry! I'm impressed!
932724603285266432 2017-11-20 21:37:29 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtomicDaydreams OK point Oliver. In rebuttal, I would guide you to the entirety of religious violence and societal impediment as an argument against symbolic meaning in religion. Original intent of 'symbols' becomes literal one generation on.
932722991489630210 2017-11-20 21:31:04 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtomicDaydreams Sheesh Oliver did you write that whole thing? That is some research bruh!
932722555244253184 2017-11-20 21:29:20 UTC <howtoheretic> @openargs @slippy83 You are the first to ask that! But yes, I think merch is a possibility in the near future!
932657431741579264 2017-11-20 17:10:34 UTC <howtoheretic> HAHAHAHA! OMG watch the video, it's comedy GOLD! And watch out for those crocodiles!https://twitter.com/hemantmehta/status/932653039768322048
932628325792563201 2017-11-20 15:14:54 UTC <howtoheretic> Hello Heretics! Ep #9 - Owl Creatures Great and Small - is up for patrons! This week we're joined by Andrew Torrez of @openargs, and we lay down the law, Leviticus style! Why not become a patron today?
932348430554316801 2017-11-19 20:42:42 UTC <howtoheretic> @amazingmap @feralcryptid Yeah I've never heard of the French invasion of Greenland. Sounds like a wonderful idea for a film though.
932065000784510976 2017-11-18 01:56:27 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 I got married on Dec 20th '13. That was the night a Federal judge shit-hammered UT's anti-marriage equality law. Our agnostic mayor waited until we got our license at 7:30 or so to do it. It was civil, non-religious and amazing!
932061630107598849 2017-11-18 01:43:04 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 Are you looking to get hitched?
932061491871727619 2017-11-18 01:42:31 UTC <howtoheretic> @thinkincAU @AdamReakes @katiemelbourne While obviously men, I know all these podcasters personally and can't think of better allies and advocates for women, people of color, LGBTQI (which includes myself) etc. There's no good reason to try to make enemies of friends.
932060265666904064 2017-11-18 01:37:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 Depends on your area and what you are looking for. You can easily have a friend get an internet "priesthood" if you like. Any mayor or delightfully ship's captain can do it as well. Our power is in creativity and wit, those are a good guide for this.
932058796494528514 2017-11-18 01:31:48 UTC <howtoheretic> @UtahOutcasts So I can order the fries rather than the salad?
932047839844122624 2017-11-18 00:48:16 UTC <howtoheretic> @amazingmap Greenland?
932042152351121409 2017-11-18 00:25:40 UTC <howtoheretic> @SarahTalkRadio @UtahOutcasts OH!!!! The Hobby-Lobby ISIS funding artifact smuggling underground! Yes I think you're right! It's a pity there isn't a Biblical prohibition on theft, like ya know, a 'commandment' for instance.
932016988406276097 2017-11-18 22:45:40 UTC <howtoheretic> @SarahTalkRadio In 2017 that is also a distinctly real possibility.
932003612984721408 2017-11-18 21:52:31 UTC <howtoheretic> @SarahTalkRadio Sweet! So this is where we can put all the bibles and every few years go look at the dusty relics and nod with relief that we finally realized they belong behind glass as reminders of a violent and horrible human adolescence? I'm for it!
931744152710029312 2017-11-17 04:41:31 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 So here's hoping the ghastly Christian right and their greatest champion, the thrice married, vulgar, braggadocios Trump cling to each other like two panicked, drowning men and sink to the bottom so the rest of us can get on with the world.
931743219120926720 2017-11-17 04:37:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 And in so doing Ford killed his electoral chances. As bad as that situation was, the Trump/Pence nightmare is way worse. The Christian-Scold-In-Chief Pence seems far more tainted in Russian tar than Ford was in common corruption.
931742574406021120 2017-11-17 04:35:15 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 But in answer to your original question - there is no good answer. I would hope that there would be a Nixon/Ford scenario. Meaning dopey Ford gave a full pardon to awful Nixon in the hope of "healing the nation"
931741964550119424 2017-11-17 04:32:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 Ash! I have a connection to the Evil Dead series, and indeed Ash.
931736253413842945 2017-11-17 04:10:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 M'kay just understand that is a racist/Christianist/Trumpist pathetic dog-whistle. And obviously I now love your gorgeous dog who demanded your attention. Whats it's name?
931733100173729793 2017-11-17 03:57:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 Democrat? Might you have meant Democratic? That petty Christianist pejorative gives away your game Jonathan.
931628977168384000 2017-11-17 21:03:51 UTC <howtoheretic> @sctbrdy If only all windows opened that easly
931621605444218880 2017-11-17 20:34:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @sctbrdy Ha! In overly long meetings I have threatened to auto-defenestrate if we don't wrap it up.
931559886441275392 2017-11-17 16:29:19 UTC <howtoheretic> @ProPandaPanda @sctbrdy Thanks for the hookup Scott, sounds like a pretty sticky situation!
931556576355237888 2017-11-17 16:16:09 UTC <howtoheretic> @sctbrdy @ProPandaPanda I just followed you. Follow back and we can DM
931554421611175936 2017-11-17 16:07:36 UTC <howtoheretic> @ProPandaPanda @sctbrdy Yeah we did a coming out episode, but this one is a real pickle! The first obvious question is what is the person's age?
931343519536386048 2017-11-16 02:09:33 UTC <howtoheretic> @dissonance_pod Where is the Thunderdome relative to there? Second question- Between the two of you who enter it Tom and Cecil, which one is more likely leave? I'll take my answer off the air love the show.
931337251014918145 2017-11-16 01:44:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @probablyforsale I'm old school. Peppridge Farms was the first tapas restaurant. Especially if you were from a huge white trash Mormon family from Utah. Free little nibbles by the fistful before they asked you to leave!
931298493586579456 2017-11-16 23:10:38 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Not saying it's not worth doing though ;)
931297067795755008 2017-11-16 23:04:58 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose True, but it would be super awkward when you tracked him to his mom's house and she said he had to finish his algebra homework before you stomped him.
931296331095670784 2017-11-16 23:02:02 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Wow that guy's set himself up for a lifetime of getting smashed in the balls and the snout, then dying alone. Oh well, evolution! She works in mysterious ways!
931286913973043201 2017-11-16 22:24:37 UTC <howtoheretic> @slippy83 BARF!
931217457741684736 2017-11-16 17:48:37 UTC <howtoheretic> @stevennovella @Kyrall A fine lesson for skeptics - begin with being skeptical of your won belief's/assumptions!
930949316813787136 2017-11-15 00:03:07 UTC <howtoheretic> @elibosnick @heathenwright @mikeldiablos Gah! I forgot that in the Southern Hemisphere your political process spins the the way round!
930912346356060160 2017-11-15 21:36:13 UTC <howtoheretic> @Keithtimber Thank you Keith!
930905955750920192 2017-11-15 21:10:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @Keithtimber We're definitely going to cover a lot of that ground. Our 'Watch-Out for Woo' segment has dealt with a little so far, Deepak Chopra for example. More to come!
930817466862796800 2017-11-15 15:19:12 UTC <howtoheretic> Heretics! Ep #8 - Circle Toot - is now available to all the people! Rejoice! Hear Paige tell us how to survive the Holidays this year surrounded by Jesus & Trump loving relatives! YOU WILL NEED THIS!
930816498863570944 2017-11-15 15:15:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @elibosnick @heathenwright @MycinJ @theappliancenrd Oh! Thats right! My mistake! Congrats to the happy couple!
930603618083905536 2017-11-14 01:09:26 UTC <howtoheretic> @GeorgiaHumanist That makes him Trump's most accomplished nominee for anything to date. Jesus, the intolerant left.
930599702831144960 2017-11-14 00:53:53 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtheistRepublic 4- even though there were loads of other people. So his daughters (who have no names) decide that they should get Lot drunk and rape him! And so they did. They had cross-eyed babies and now you understand Biblical morality. The end.
930598802347540480 2017-11-14 00:50:18 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtheistRepublic 3- Who-the-f-ck knows. Thus the cartoon above. BUT later Lot and the 2 daughters he was going to chum the rape swarm with arrive at a cave. Because it was the Bronze Age and people were dumber than even we are now, they thought there were no other people-
930598168101732352 2017-11-14 00:47:47 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtheistRepublic 2- So, the angels (weirdly for the OT) prevent that. Next day familia Lot flee S&G, & the hot, destroying angels tell them not to look back. Lot's wife (she doesn't have a name, of course) does, and is turned to a pillar of salt. Why?
930597645105610752 2017-11-14 00:45:42 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtheistRepublic Oh dear. OK Genesis 19. Angels come to destroy the Greater S&G metro area. Lot takes them in. All the men in the city want to rape them. He's a solid host yet also fully pro-rape, so offers his daughters for the raping-

930492864554926080 2017-11-14 17:49:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtomicDaydreams They're all stories, anturally. For some reason the Buddhist obsession with the specifics of hell are way more fleshed out than most Christian versions. They're into it. Take them at their word.
930491950947434496 2017-11-14 17:45:43 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtomicDaydreams The descriptions in the texts are credited directly to the Buddha, and I didn't see any attempt there to say they were anything but 'real'. Thus theological discussions about employee's and the fate of their souls. Real enough.
930480381224132608 2017-11-14 16:59:45 UTC <howtoheretic> @AtomicDaydreams If you say so. All heavens/hells are symbolic since none exist. However the incredible specificity of durations of time,  physical dimensions and debates about the souls of those who work in Narakka are a bit odd for just symbols.
930263378831933440 2017-11-13 02:37:27 UTC <howtoheretic> @UtahOutcasts Funny I've been dreaming about that. It frightens me to say that yes, I do know how.

928845503642550272 2017-11-09 04:43:19 UTC <howtoheretic> @uspatrick You're right of course. But let's all make the f-ing pious, moralizing holier-than-thou GOP pay for this child rapist. And the next one, and the next one, and the other all of them, etc.
928842521253355521 2017-11-09 04:31:28 UTC <howtoheretic> This is an upright Christian GOP daddy saying a 14 year old girl should have made a better choice in relation to the Alabama assistant DA who was a lawyer/prosecutor 20 years her senior.

928817385376587777 2017-11-09 02:51:35 UTC <howtoheretic> @UtahOutcasts Not to teach pious Christians their precious bible, but Joseph did not get Mary pregnant, it was the world-destroying Demi-Gorgon that put a magic baby in her tummy that he would later make a human sacrifice of, because...love?
928816572130406400 2017-11-09 02:48:22 UTC <howtoheretic> @scottneilson @UTBoardofEd we wonder if defenses of child sexual predation are cool with you? Please read the @washingtonpost story and decide if @scottNeilson speaks for you.https://twitter.com/BjaminWood/status/928804363518087169
928810692630548480 2017-11-09 02:25:00 UTC <howtoheretic> @jimzeigler @tedlieu Maximum love/respect Mr Lieu, but the bible is replete with justifications for rape, sexual violence and is at best a pro-slavery manual. If y'all shun the Old Testament, quit selling it as a matched set.

926678431512739842 2017-11-03 05:12:09 UTC <howtoheretic> @TillyFifle Many atheists think baptisms 4 the dead are NBD. I disagree. Presuming to have permission to erase a person's life is abhorrent and hateful.
926620771178364928 2017-11-03 01:23:02 UTC <howtoheretic> Wait wut? Someone who believes in baptisms for the dead is accusing someone else of disrespecting the lives of the departed?

922871645273972736 2017-10-24 17:05:21 UTC <howtoheretic> "of" Deepak. That just goes to show how empty poor Deepak really is.

921113257082892289 2017-10-19 20:38:08 UTC <howtoheretic> @dissonance_pod @Ziggy66 SEE!
921108486578061312 2017-10-19 20:19:11 UTC <howtoheretic> Excellent Diatribe today @Noah_Lugeons. You too can try to heft the lead BOM at Lighthouse bookstore, 1358 S W Temple, SLC UT  like we did!
921107828411998208 2017-10-19 20:16:34 UTC <howtoheretic> @dissonance_pod @Ziggy66 But sadly it's been appropriated by people who go to sports bars &  golf. The straights always appropriate everything good we create. Sigh
920710909466624000 2017-10-18 17:59:21 UTC <howtoheretic> @Stephencheatley Thanks! I'm worried we might have pissed off any ex-gay Charleston enthusiasts. But it had to be said.

920448799369076736 2017-10-17 00:37:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @dissonance_pod Guh OK Tom and Cecil we get it we were awesome - give it a break!
920342737869606913 2017-10-17 17:36:22 UTC <howtoheretic> @NHStevenBi Elder Eli
920331437533888512 2017-10-17 16:51:28 UTC <howtoheretic> @NHStevenBi There was indeed a power struggle after the great 2nd Alma panic of '17. But it was resolved peacefully after Eli licked everyone.
920304754131066880 2017-10-17 15:05:26 UTC <howtoheretic> If ya'll haven't heard the Gamcasts your life has been wasted. None of them will ever beat the SLC live show, but they're still pretty good.https://twitter.com/elibosnick/status/920297923002368002
920139007241023489 2017-10-16 04:06:49 UTC <howtoheretic> @Secular_Rose Go with it. And BTW, Dan isn't the 'straightest' guy ever, trust me ;)

918955583281041408 2017-10-13 21:44:19 UTC <howtoheretic> @dissonance_pod @johanges We're here to help. Think like Web MD but for bullshit.
918947906593292289 2017-10-13 21:13:48 UTC <howtoheretic> @dissonance_pod @johanges It has to do with a positive/negative pressure relationship on either side of the Glory Hole and a medical grade microphone. Tune in Monday!

917559443574857728 2017-10-09 01:16:33 UTC <howtoheretic> @elibosnick @heathenwright @Noah_Lugeons @slippy83 For the moment we are on our website http://www.howtoheretic.com. Should post in itunes any moment now. We hope you enjoy our bullshit!
