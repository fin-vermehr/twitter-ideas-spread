But then I remember that it was written by someone accused by many women of misconduct and someone who always defends the alleged predator and never has empathy for the alleged victim. Trump has no moral authority or credibility.

In 2017, their rate is 28% and they get their salt deductions. In 2018, their rate is 32% and they can only deduct 10k for salt. In many locations, that income is middle class. Paul Ryan doesnt say this

No new benefits except a small % decrease which does not make up for the salt reduction. Ill still itemize. The kickerthe new law discourages me from making even 10k more bc Ill end up in a higher bracket where at that income my rate will be higher than prev tax law.

943860507768913920 2017-12-21 15:07:35 UTC <uniteagainstDJT> @realDonaldTrump @Realjmannarino FYI many middle class Americans will see their taxes go up. Ive done the calculations and my taxes will go up. Sorry if we are not happy about that.
943699536270254080 2017-12-20 04:27:57 UTC <uniteagainstDJT> @tedlieu So true. GOP is treating us like we are idiots. Most of us are not Fox viewers. We realize what is happening. Im going to see an increase of a few thousand dollars for a very unworthy cause. #Theft

943563900246781954 2017-12-20 19:28:59 UTC <uniteagainstDJT> @RepPeteKing @NWO_Destroyer The point is that they are not putting more money in taxpayers pockets. Instead they are drastically increasing taxes on millions of Americans in blue states and giving a little bit of that money to their constituents and most of it to their donors.
943562497310756874 2017-12-20 19:23:24 UTC <uniteagainstDJT> @RepPeteKing PLEASE amend this bill to bring back full SALT deductions. Here in Illinois we are panicking about our huge tax hikes, lower property values, and hit to our local economy...all so that our money can be given to the wealthy! Help us!!!!
943556817099067393 2017-12-20 19:00:50 UTC <uniteagainstDJT> @PodSaveAmerica So many of us in the middle class in blue states are going to see our taxes go up by the thousands.
