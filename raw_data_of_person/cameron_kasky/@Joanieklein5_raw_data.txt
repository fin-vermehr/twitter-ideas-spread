929967487763881984 2017-11-12 07:01:41 UTC <Joanieklein5> @AltUSPressSec Word. 
929493722814803968 2017-11-11 23:39:07 UTC <Joanieklein5> @TeaPainUSA Are you sure that was shoe polish on his lips?
929043812130758657 2017-11-10 17:51:20 UTC <Joanieklein5> @ALT_DOJ Because CNN, along with the rest of us, recognize the @GOP have no moral character and would prefer children were molested if it means theyll win a senate seat.
929007993437396993 2017-11-10 15:29:00 UTC <Joanieklein5> @GOP @bychristinebswk Seems like integrity is something that should have been taught individually in their homes.
928797557844668416 2017-11-09 01:32:48 UTC <Joanieklein5> @InvestigateRU Hmmm.  Might want to think twice before committing treason next time.
928794104854487040 2017-11-09 01:19:05 UTC <Joanieklein5> @krassenstein The treason business just isnt as profitable as it was in the good old days.
928793485032824832 2017-11-09 01:16:37 UTC <Joanieklein5> @realDonaldTrump @Unpersuaded112 I think this is the first thing Ive ever agreed with him on.
928477298361171968 2017-11-08 04:20:12 UTC <Joanieklein5> @SteveWestly Hasnt it always been political?  At what point did it serve constituents interests?
928464167782178816 2017-11-08 03:28:02 UTC <Joanieklein5> @EdKrassen That would be the BEST Christmas gift EVER!!!
928464161549443072 2017-11-08 03:28:00 UTC <Joanieklein5> @RealMuckmaker They should. You reap what you sow. Karma.
928430221161721856 2017-11-08 01:13:08 UTC <Joanieklein5> @Rosie @FoxNews @seanhannity @RealJamesWoods @SpeakerRyan @AaronBlake @wmcarterelliott Actually its the sociopath thing that gives Trump the edge. I know many extremely moral atheists.
928429628145909762 2017-11-08 01:10:47 UTC <Joanieklein5> This is worth watching. @RepDelBene questioning the R tax plan.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PDB1ZJjJnPA
928412232303575041 2017-11-08 00:01:39 UTC <Joanieklein5> @amplifirenews_ Good. Let them think they lost because the R candidate wasnt Trumpian enough. That way theyll continue losing.
928400776686313472 2017-11-08 23:16:08 UTC <Joanieklein5> @lauferlaw Poor babies. 
928399811891535873 2017-11-08 23:12:18 UTC <Joanieklein5> @realDonaldTrump @The_UnSilent_ No doubt.

928330870150258688 2017-11-08 18:38:21 UTC <Joanieklein5> @joncoopertweets Ole @DarrellIssa must finally be feeling the heat. Hes finally going to vote in his constituents favor. Whats up with that?!
928330221522108416 2017-11-08 18:35:47 UTC <Joanieklein5> @GOP @OMGno2trump Maine voters need to take to the streets. This is bull!

928108094713864192 2017-11-07 03:53:07 UTC <Joanieklein5> @funder Thank you Scott Dworkin for leading us through the muck. 
928075258204008448 2017-11-07 01:42:39 UTC <Joanieklein5> @PhilMurphyNJ @flippable_org No wonder Christie was so out of sorts with the woman constituent he was bullying outside the voting precinct. 
928074421847257088 2017-11-07 01:39:19 UTC <Joanieklein5> @mattmfm Why and how he ever got into politics is beyond me. Hes such a nasty bully of a person.

928036489669197825 2017-11-07 23:08:35 UTC <Joanieklein5> @ladiesgun Yeah, well the rest of us will riot in the streets if @POTUS is not impeached. And thank God, there are a lot more of us than you.
927981478754914304 2017-11-07 19:30:00 UTC <Joanieklein5> @joncoopertweets Oh gosh, church huh?  Shall we take a poll on our preferred places to be shot?  I choose protesting lack of gun control in front of the WH
927977460771069952 2017-11-07 19:14:02 UTC <Joanieklein5> @GOP @ALT_DOJ Because theyre obviously against preventing future tragedies.
927754952495177728 2017-11-06 04:29:52 UTC <Joanieklein5> @alliewen21 @djcp I have no doubt.
927679152345325568 2017-11-06 23:28:40 UTC <Joanieklein5> @alliewen21 Fortunately we didnt have a National Alcohol Association that had the R and some D congresspeople in their pocket.

923706479684722688 2017-10-26 00:22:41 UTC <Joanieklein5> @PalmerReport It would require the R base to notice, understand and acknowledge his gaffe for it to matter. Definitely beyond their intellectual skills.

884872489309831168 2017-07-11 20:30:16 UTC <Joanieklein5> @DRUDGE_REPORT I say they conduct an investigation on deSantis. The way the R's have been conducting themselves I'm sure he's guilty of some heinous crime.

884543600666714113 2017-07-10 22:43:23 UTC <Joanieklein5> @realDonaldTrump Is that when you asked Ivanka to hold your seat? While you were giving our country away?

884121145812762624 2017-07-09 18:44:41 UTC <Joanieklein5> @joncoopertweets Shame on him. He knows that a lie. Predator and his operatives are learning well from their heros, the Russians, about spewing propaganda.
883881494506160129 2017-07-08 02:52:24 UTC <Joanieklein5> @joncoopertweets Oh?  What does our president have to say about that??

883728297032536065 2017-07-08 16:43:39 UTC <Joanieklein5> @BraddJaffy The rest of his statement:  nor should any of the other gibberish that comes out of his mouth.
883727354350125056 2017-07-08 16:39:54 UTC <Joanieklein5> Watching Velshi & Ruhle educating the public on health care. We need the media to do more of this type of teaching.

880455382224707584 2017-06-29 15:58:15 UTC <Joanieklein5> @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump You WISH you had Mika's IQ and her degree of psychological health. Believe me, the rest of the country wishes the same.

880452567783755776 2017-06-29 15:47:04 UTC <Joanieklein5> @MelissaJPeltier @kylegriffin1 It's just so darned uncomfortable to admit to treason.
880452189625307136 2017-06-29 15:45:34 UTC <Joanieklein5> @MelissaJPeltier @olgaNYC1211 Campaigning for 2020 so we can have more of the same through 2024.
880450623073689600 2017-06-29 15:39:21 UTC <Joanieklein5> @MelissaJPeltier Makes you wonder about his parenting. Didn't anyone try to teach him how to act as a person?
880232898749538304 2017-06-28 01:14:11 UTC <Joanieklein5> @AP_Politics I call BS. A classic counter attack. They're been caught red handed messing with our democracy so their defense is to accuse us of same
880229694863327232 2017-06-28 01:01:27 UTC <Joanieklein5> @aletweetsnews @oppstn Oh, you gotta love that!
880229241291329538 2017-06-28 00:59:39 UTC <Joanieklein5> @meganmckenzie94 So now he slithers off to Fox News where he'll fit right in.

879835983146958848 2017-06-27 22:56:59 UTC <Joanieklein5> @PalmerReport He's such an embarrassment.
879824074301612032 2017-06-27 22:09:40 UTC <Joanieklein5> @SenSchumer @BraddJaffy OMG!  Just like  a REAL democracy!
879821556830027776 2017-06-27 21:59:40 UTC <Joanieklein5> @TIME Is it okay if we put him in jail?
879806953655943173 2017-06-27 21:01:38 UTC <Joanieklein5> @MelissaJPeltier Yet unfortunately true.
879806771589554176 2017-06-27 21:00:55 UTC <Joanieklein5> @RoguePOTUSStaff One branch of the government lobbying another to get the hell out of the way?!  What the f!!!
879805521263337472 2017-06-27 20:55:56 UTC <Joanieklein5> @thehill Maybe if he'd lay off that avocado toast he could afford housing.
879543128750870533 2017-06-26 03:33:17 UTC <Joanieklein5> We need a health system that's #ForOurPatients! I won't accept reform that puts millions at risk of losing coverage.https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54ddo5i/48ssg

879432568008876032 2017-06-26 20:13:57 UTC <Joanieklein5> @joncoopertweets @sethdmichaels Why do they feel so insulated?  Why do they think they're going to get a pass for taking our democracy from us?
879424439275864065 2017-06-26 19:41:39 UTC <Joanieklein5> @realDonaldTrump @joncoopertweets @tedlieu Maybe after KellyAnn comes out of prison and tries to get a job, she can work at one of those fine coal jobs Trump's saving.
879421154984730624 2017-06-26 19:28:36 UTC <Joanieklein5> @ananavarro @RaisinGirl21 Hahahaha!!  I saw that!

879420230019104768 2017-06-26 19:24:56 UTC <Joanieklein5> @ananavarro That would assume she'd have anything to do with him in the early morning or any other time for that matter.
879383489874845697 2017-06-26 16:58:56 UTC <Joanieklein5> @AJentleson Of course he does. Wouldn't want to face the truth concerning his actions. How uncomfortable.
878953228049805312 2017-06-25 12:29:14 UTC <Joanieklein5> @AltUSPressSec As well as good representation in congress for too many of them.

878748799254114304 2017-06-24 22:56:54 UTC <Joanieklein5> @TherealSondraVa @lauferlaw Are you sure about that?
878748732589842433 2017-06-24 22:56:38 UTC <Joanieklein5> @lauferlaw @TherealSondraVa Me thinks you give them too much credit.
878748458064257024 2017-06-24 22:55:33 UTC <Joanieklein5> @lauferlaw And you know they would find a way to justify their blind loyalty to the Predator.
878747544901361664 2017-06-24 22:51:55 UTC <Joanieklein5> @lauferlaw God i hope your optimism isn't misplaced.

878037581224488960 2017-06-22 23:50:47 UTC <Joanieklein5> @MelissaJPeltier Trump must be his mentor.
878012998018777088 2017-06-22 22:13:06 UTC <Joanieklein5> @impeach_d_trump Of course he did.

877540330266124288 2017-06-21 14:54:53 UTC <Joanieklein5> @lauferlaw I don't know. It worked pretty well for R's during Obama's time in office.

875860934845231104 2017-06-16 23:41:34 UTC <mattmfm> Advice for the Trump WH: agenda-setting by an Administration is pretty useless if there's no policy announcements to support the agenda.
875727214049804289 2017-06-16 14:50:12 UTC <Joanieklein5> @realDonaldTrump Yes, we've all come to that conclusion.

875000828846788609 2017-06-14 14:43:48 UTC <Joanieklein5> @ALT_DOJ I blame both parties for a lack of a gun control policy. They sure take notice when they're the victims but children attending school is ok.

874698450964631552 2017-06-13 18:42:16 UTC <Joanieklein5> @SenJohnMcCain. Your wife is going to work for The Predator?  Surely you know he's hiring her in an attempt to have you beholden to him.
