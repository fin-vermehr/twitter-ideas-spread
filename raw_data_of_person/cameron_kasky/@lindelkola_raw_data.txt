727671803124944896 2016-05-03 01:30:52 UTC <lindelkola> This I believe: Trump squashes Cruz like a bug and this speech begins his "actual campaign."
727662963914477568 2016-05-03 00:55:44 UTC <lindelkola> I do believe the Cruz-Fiorina campaign was shorter than 2014's Simpsons marathon on FXX... BY SIX DAYS.  #2016race
