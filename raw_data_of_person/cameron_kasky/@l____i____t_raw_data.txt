968971796501483520 2018-02-28 22:10:53 UTC <l____i____t> @KevinMKruse @DineandDish Yeah, I just heard about a shooting at Dalton highschool and it was a teacher... I get so scared to go to school because of all this. I check my surroundings 24/7 and get so anxious. Every time I hear a long bang I freeze up and feel like Im about to have a heart attack.

966759506796478465 2018-02-22 19:40:02 UTC <l____i____t> @RVAjenks Will there be consequences if students that attend a school in Henrico do the walkout that is held on 4/20? If you havent heard about it, its a protest for school safety (banning guns). I wanted to participate in it but I was just wondering if there is punishment.
966439839703945216 2018-02-21 22:29:48 UTC <l____i____t> @dcexaminer I also remember one of my teachers being afraid to kill a FREAKING BUG. What makes you think they can kill a person.
966439666143694848 2018-02-21 22:29:06 UTC <l____i____t> @dcexaminer Im a 15 year old student and I wouldnt feel safer with teachers with guns. Teachers could go crazy one day and kill as well. Teachers arent police officers. Knowing some teachers from my school, they wouldnt even pick up a gun without having a panic attack.

I had so much memories flow through my head of him and all the fun things we did together with my brothers. It feels good to know Im not alone. Thank you so muchthis song is a blessing
963235631282475008 2018-02-12 02:17:25 UTC <l____i____t> @WittLowry This is the first time Ive ever related so much to a song before...I also lost my dad to cancer. I felt the same emotions. I was broken and angry. I miss my dad so much. This song helped me remember memories I had of him. I cried thoughout the whole video.
