970423855230537732 2018-03-04 22:20:51 UTC <whereyoufindyou> Strangely enough, it was the pain that opened me like a book and allowed me to write happiness within myself.pic.twitter.com/7CRAUJZYXQ
969629440337616896 2018-03-02 17:44:08 UTC <whereyoufindyou> My missing piece has your blond hair, your blue eyes, and a part of my heart locked within a cage. My heart used to be packaged with a bow tied on, and your name on the shipping address. I guess you didnt pay enough attention to the instructions: handle with care.

966071109576671232 2018-02-20 22:04:35 UTC <whereyoufindyou> The snow fell slowly, letting a single flake drift into my palm. But it melted immediately.  Im not going to lessen my fire to accommodate you. I will find a falling star, so that we can spin through the snowy sky, burning, forever.pic.twitter.com/DPkvEE8ct3
965346407191166976 2018-02-18 22:04:53 UTC <whereyoufindyou> I was disappointed when I couldn't find @storm_jon In My Head at  @Powells. Hopefully that means someone else bought it. Wish me luck on future searches!
965267654339526657 2018-02-18 16:51:57 UTC <whereyoufindyou> I would burn myself down in a rain of embers, if I only knew that you would fall in love with the ashes.
963944677492731905 2018-02-14 01:14:54 UTC <whereyoufindyou> Cities are full of people. You can't stand still in New York or L.A. because the world would lose you. Some days I sit on a bench in a city and marvel at how much we all fear being lost.
943604035759640576 2017-12-20 22:08:28 UTC <whereyoufindyou> Reality is difficult to write about, if only because no one wants to read about it.
941336312392531968 2017-12-14 15:57:20 UTC <whereyoufindyou> How amazing it felt  To wake up next to you To know that if nothing else We shared our dreams  How terrible it felt To wake up without you To know that if nothing else I was alone in my pain
938935751680466944 2017-12-07 00:58:22 UTC <whereyoufindyou> The sad truth is that you never know what you have until you've lost it. #SoCalFires Everyone has a story about their experience, and a place in California. Don't get lost in the crowd of people, saying, "my life is a tragedy" because it's not. You are not what happened to you.
937876579014676480 2017-12-04 02:49:35 UTC <whereyoufindyou> SO THIS IS WHAT A NIGHTMARE IS  How amazing it felt  To wake up next to you To know that if nothing else We shared our dreams  How terrible it felt To wake up without you To know that if nothing else I was alone in my pain
935188961487552512 2017-11-27 16:49:58 UTC <whereyoufindyou> How terrible it is that we live in a world where the best we can be is always someone else.
932387914062774272 2017-11-19 23:19:36 UTC <whereyoufindyou> I fell in love with you because I thought youd make me better. And you did. But pain wasnt the teacher I was hoping for.
930527282380152832 2017-11-14 20:06:07 UTC <whereyoufindyou> Everyone has the power to make something of themselves. We tell each other that we cannot.  Everyone has a pain or struggle. We tell each other that we struggle more.  Everyone has a life to live. We say its meaningless, and that we cant change anything.  Were wrong.
929887187968987136 2017-11-12 01:42:36 UTC <whereyoufindyou> lortifra October 11, 2017 As youre reminiscing, feeling the sudden urge to run, just run, as far as you can and then keep going from there, trying to outrun your past until you realize you cant and youre lost because you accidently ended up in Arkansas (or maybe on purpose)
929161154445717504 2017-11-10 01:37:36 UTC <whereyoufindyou> I don't miss you. Really I don't. I don't write poetry because that's the only way I know how to talk about you. Really I don't. You're not the center of my universe. Really I don't. But I miss what you took, and these words flow because the sun is all too bright to be my center.
929159184481861633 2017-11-10 01:29:47 UTC <whereyoufindyou> The day when the sound of your voice doesnt bring my mind to its knees will be the day that I have no ears at all.
926947125807611905 2017-11-04 22:59:51 UTC <whereyoufindyou> Every moment that I try to forget you, I begin to lose myself instead.
925072170497163264 2017-10-30 18:49:27 UTC <whereyoufindyou> I used to think that the hardest thing was to forget. Now I know that the hardest thing isnt to forget- its wanting to.
925070633821597696 2017-10-30 18:43:20 UTC <whereyoufindyou> The pages fly by and the only part of my story I can read are the chapters of you.
924738897031991296 2017-10-29 20:45:08 UTC <whereyoufindyou> Youd tell me I was amazing, and beautiful, but you never said I was bright. You thought: no one with a brain would pick you. #microfiction
924529396970434561 2017-10-28 06:52:39 UTC <whereyoufindyou> Sometimes the trees whisper back to the wind. Take me with you, they say. Im tired of being the strong one. #thisiswhereyoufindyou
924528037500039168 2017-10-28 06:47:15 UTC <whereyoufindyou> The problem with windows is that sometimes people forget that whats beyond the glass is real too.  #thisiswhereyoufindyou
