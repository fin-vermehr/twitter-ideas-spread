967066339721596929 2018-02-23 15:59:17 UTC <CdnCheryl1969> @Bell_Support @Bell @Morning_Joe @bstephenmitchel Oh my !!! I just emailed executive office . Tired of the runaround with 100 different excuses. Every time you call , you get another excuse or promise of it being fixed!!!!
967010261185056768 2018-02-23 12:16:27 UTC <CdnCheryl1969> @Bell_Support @Bell @Morning_Joe @bstephenmitchel They refused giving a credit . We asked. Not very happy and am seriously thinking of leaving bell if this continues. But hopefully they will fix this for everyone if we all keep complaining. I think we may call back in a few days if still not fixed and demand some sort of credit
967008250427305985 2018-02-23 12:08:27 UTC <CdnCheryl1969> @Bell_Support @Bell @Morning_Joe @bstephenmitchel Youre welcome!!! Also tell them you want it escalated to have it fixed . Ive been told 3 times when calling into bell support technical that the issue was fixed . First was told it was msnbc fault, than told it was a glitch because they updated their software . Sick of it

966272735470120961 2018-02-21 11:25:47 UTC <CdnCheryl1969> @MSNBC @Bell @Morning_Joe @bstephenmitchel @prieuraj I called bell technical last night and was informed that it was fixed !!! Well its not fixed . And with over a week now Im really getting annoyed with this. First told it was Msnbc fault and call them, than I call back and am told you guys fixed it 2 days ago.
