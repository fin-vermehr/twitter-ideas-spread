969770847933263873 2018-03-02 03:06:02 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @FightGoodFight1 From an observational perspective, Ive noticed equal numbers of Sacccone(R) signs, but they seem clustered in public spaces or on the roadside, whereas the Lamb signs are in peoples yards, who are happily showing their support for a quality candidate. #ConorLambForCongress
969769910082703361 2018-03-02 03:02:18 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @FightGoodFight1 In 2016 I rolled my eyes when someone said Trump would win PA bc Hillary had no lawn signs... however, it is noticeable in #PA18 that #ConorLambForCongress signs are EVERYWHERE. Dems in the area are excited for their chance to vote in a #BlueWave2018 election.

966865614177492993 2018-02-22 02:41:40 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @realDonaldTrump Studies have shown more guns=more accidental shootings. States w/ most guns have 9x the rate of unintentional shootings.   For each time a private gun is used in a legally justifiable shooting, there are 4 unintentional shootings, 7 criminal assaults, & 11 attempted suicides.

965073668635353089 2018-02-17 04:01:07 UTC <PSU_Blaze> Based on Trumps tweet storm, I can only assume yesterday he saw the indictments as vindication & today someone explained the implications to him using small words.

956911973547036673 2018-01-26 15:29:27 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @VP @Easterngirl77 No solution will be 100%, but some progress is better than none. Sandy Hook may not have been preventable, but what about any of the other 11 school shootings that have already happened this month. We cant have an ex post facto to punish existing offenders, but why not start now

Most are in states that refused medicaid expansion. Demand isnt enough to maintain Supply. Rural hospitals still depend on a safety net of Medicare, Medicaid & CHIP

951808846024118274 2018-01-12 13:31:27 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @realDonaldTrump Actually, DEMOCRATIC @SenatorCardin introduced The Federal Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2017 (S.861) which ensures Gov workers are paid in the event of a shutdown. Clearly they dont want to stop paying them. But I appreciate your seeming accidental support of that legislation!

942961836806287360 2017-12-18 03:36:35 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @PressSec A typical family of four earning $45,000 per year would normally qualify for CHIP. I guess now they can use that $1,379 to pay for SOME of their increased health care premiums. Too bad they wont qualify for the private jet, luxury car or private school deductions. 
942957387367018496 2017-12-18 03:18:55 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @PressSec STFU, Sarah... Congress couldve easily passed a bi-partisan tax cut w/ an 80% approval rating if Republicans cared about working families more than big business. Instead they chose to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich in a bill w/ 33% approval. (Even Rs dont like it)
942935235355914247 2017-12-18 01:50:53 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @POTUS @PressSec @shane_wakeley @Emanuel_Maureen If you want to drive the same truck as a professional you need even more training, to pass knowledge & skill tests, an additional license, more insurance, and to pass physical & mental background checks.   But, yeah tell me about how guns and trucks are the same.
942934522110365696 2017-12-18 01:48:03 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @POTUS @PressSec @shane_wakeley @Emanuel_Maureen If youre saying trucks & guns should be treated the same, I agree. To drive a truck you need to be tested & licensed. The truck needs to be registered & you need insurance to cover damage that might be done with your truck.
942934005044994049 2017-12-18 01:46:00 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @POTUS @PressSec @shane_wakeley @Emanuel_Maureen  =  is a false argument. There was a terrorist truck attack in NYC on Halloween, killed 8 & injured dozens. Liberal snowflakes werent calling for the ban of trucks. The primary function of a truck is transportation. The primary function of a gun is to inflict damage
942931997311291392 2017-12-18 01:38:01 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @POTUS @PressSec @shane_wakeley @Emanuel_Maureen I didnt say ban guns, they have their uses & citizens should be able to arm themselves, to an extent. But there need to be tighter controls. Can you imagine how many fewer victims there would be if the attacker only had handguns or didnt have fully automatic-like capability?
942761403760500736 2017-12-18 14:20:08 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @MillmanGrace Im guessing its because he wanted to scream it in all caps, but we wouldnt be able to tell since its already capitalized.

942735987423305729 2017-12-18 12:39:09 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @POTUS @PressSec @shane_wakeley So... youre saying the guy wouldve killed 58 people and injured another 546 by himself without the guns? Tell that to the victims.
942735984185303040 2017-12-18 12:39:08 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @RepSwalwell The people also spoke in AL and chose Doug Jones for the Senate. Why is a vote being rushed before he can participate? Given the health of some R Senators his vote makes a huge difference.
942720918572453888 2017-12-18 11:39:16 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @SocialPowerOne1 Why not. Then all Mueller has been to do is compare his entire database to the scrubbed list to find the most incriminating emails. Also, the withheld emails can further strengthen obstruction charges. Stupid.
942563521539211264 2017-12-17 01:13:50 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @POTUS @PressSec I missed the memo about ISIS being defeated.

939125593400053760 2017-12-08 13:32:44 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @PalmerReport Yes. Ford did pardon Nixon before charges were filed.  Andrew Johnson also pardoned all who fought or aided the Confederacy, so I guess a blanket pardon may be a possibility. As @PamelaPatriot says though thats why its so important for Mueller to coordinate with States.
939121616293949442 2017-12-08 13:16:56 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @PalmerReport @PamelaPatriot My layman interpretation is Mueller is filing minimal charges now. If Trump were to grant a pardon, it would be a constitutional crisis leading to impeachment. At which point Mueller would add charges.

After Trumps endorsement of Moore, they had a golden opportunity to go against him that wouldnt have cost them votes & couldnt even do that.
938915143156674560 2017-12-07 23:36:28 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @SethAbramson Tremendous work on this thread digging into Erik Princes testimony. He either expects a pardon or knows that he has the means to live comfortably in a non-extradition country.

938746522983911424 2017-12-07 12:26:26 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @EdKrassen Of course Trump doesnt believe allegations against Moore. Anything else would give validity to his own accusers.   I know theyre not the same thing but want to throw this out as context for Trumps support: Moore dated a 14yo when he was 32. When Trump was 32, Melania was 8.

937821714381238272 2017-12-04 23:11:35 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @dcpoll In addition to the loss of government services that people rely on a government shutdown would also put 2 Million Federal employees & 7.5 Million Federal contractors out of work right before the holidays.

937711935528800258 2017-12-04 15:55:21 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @jocowboys87 @AngryFedupVtr Trump basically said today Flynn is being treated unfairly for lying to the FBI. We can hardly expect his admin to respect media enough to tell the truth. They know there's no law against lying to reporters or the public. I don't care what Kellyanne says until she's under oath.
937709997345079298 2017-12-04 15:47:39 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @kaitlancollins Does Kellyanne follow him into the throne room where he probably composes most of his tweets? Or is Trump like LBJ and just leaves the door open?

FYI a shutdown doesnt mean troop funding has to be held hostage. In 2013, Congress passed a bill for the continued pay of the military through the shutdown. Try again.

930201494686756864 2017-11-13 22:31:33 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @SpeakerRyan Please explain the wage increase!!!  1. Corporations have more money to invest in automation.  2. Fewer employees are needed  3. Skilled labor/experience become less relevant  4. Employees become interchangeable 5. But employees pay  wages out of the goodness of their hearts?

929334054188699649 2017-11-11 13:04:39 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @ThePlumLineGS Wow. Trump shows more loyalty & respect for the head of an adversarial foreign power than he does to his friends & allies.  Anyone believe Trump even brought it up? If so it was probably, "US intelligence community is saying you were involved. Ridiculous, right?" #TrumpRussia
929330466515308544 2017-11-11 12:50:23 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @RepSwalwell "Let's say it was a miscommunication. I asked for a 'gold shower.' You've seen Trump Tower. People will believe that. By the way, have you made the *ahem* video 'enhancements' we talked about?"
929169149489766400 2017-11-10 02:09:23 UTC <PSU_Blaze> Trump, the "Master Negotiator" has the US left in the dark.

929116417437437953 2017-11-10 22:39:50 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @Babadarlin There is no statute of limitations in Alabama for sexual abuse of a minor under 16. #RoyMooreChildMolester https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/alabama-statutes-of-limitations-for-sexual-abuse.html
929093108440158209 2017-11-10 21:07:13 UTC <PSU_Blaze> It's too easy for Republican Senators to say "if the accusations are true", #RoyMooreChildMolester should step down. They know damn well it will never happen. Stepping down would be an admission of guilt and there is no statute of limitations for molesting a 14yo in Alabama.

921481332747853824 2017-10-20 21:00:44 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @plantperson1 @wesley_jordan Trump wanted to wrap a bow on  and say everything's taken care of. Rossello did rebuff a few times saying there's still a lot of work.
921478430520238081 2017-10-20 20:49:12 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @maddow @thehill SHS also doubled down on the "empty-barrel" comment.   I wonder if Trump has ever made a sacred act about himself. Let me think pic.twitter.com/snIkgp0V9Y
921463217909575683 2017-10-20 19:48:45 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @realDonaldTrump Huckster-Sanders TODAY said it's inappropriate to question a General & this is what you tweet Is there a prize for top hypocrite of the day?
920976901161832448 2017-10-19 11:36:18 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump People think stories are fake bc they can't believe an Administration would have this level of gross incompetence. You're right, it's worse.
920975480257433605 2017-10-19 11:30:40 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @realDonaldTrump Seems to me a true leader whose party controlled both chambers would know if they had the votes. Too busy golfing & tweeting to do your job?
920829136213602304 2017-10-18 01:49:08 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @sbstryker Reminds me of Trump's Florida post hurricane photo-op when he said "Melania really wanted to be here." Trump can't even keep it straight.pic.twitter.com/l5PkCYk0Qc

920780266372771840 2017-10-18 22:34:57 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @Buchanan_JamesR Right....  anyway it was Sessions who kept saying he was being treated unfairly.
920694829629222917 2017-10-18 16:55:27 UTC <PSU_Blaze> Tired of hearing privileged men talk about being treated unfairly, starting w/ Pres.  They can't even imagine being discriminated against.
920689077523025921 2017-10-18 16:32:36 UTC <PSU_Blaze> Boo-hoo. Al Franken is being "unfair" to Jeff Sessions.   Imagine how those caught in the snare of unfair DOJ policies & tactics feel.

920637350174224389 2017-10-18 13:07:03 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @realDonaldTrump @SeanScheidt @LouiseMensch What exactly did Sean Spicer have in his notebook & did he take it to his meeting w/ Mueller? No wonder the President is more unhinged today
920630953256669184 2017-10-18 12:41:38 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @AgentCarter_SSR @selectedwisdom Perhaps we'd be better off if Trump sticks to sending letters (that someone else writes and he signs). He has a history of bad phone calls.
920622853296357376 2017-10-18 12:09:27 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @realDonaldTrump Q: Why are you politicizing calls to families? A: Because you were too busy golfing to honor our fallen & blamed others for your inactionpic.twitter.com/Bd5fwkuPSj

918942357353050112 2017-10-13 20:51:45 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @maddow @RichardEngel They wouldn't. By decertifying, Trump has effectively done what he said he would never do, he's taken options off the table. He wants war.
918941111598665728 2017-10-13 20:46:48 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @Alt_FedEmployee I think he's run out of people to have fake feuds with so now it's on to fake holiday wars.   Yep. That F'ing guy is the President.

918924345690476548 2017-10-13 19:40:11 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @BurnettCynthia @thehill The guy who supposedly had the best plans now wants Congress to solve Iran, HC, Taxes, etc. His only thought is to do the opposite of Obama.

898628512134815744 2017-08-18 19:31:47 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @contenteddriver @M_G_Stone One has to ask, what would it mean if firing Bannon "fixed" the White House? A: Trump is weak and malleable not a true leader or Chief Exec.

885620981942890497 2017-07-13 22:04:30 UTC <PSU_Blaze> GOP Congressman: Get DT Jr, Ivanka and Jared out of the White House... Then who would be Pres & who would babysit?https://apple.news/AyfpcbXNyRA-wYwQejWMVjg
885484204791918592 2017-07-13 13:01:00 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @joncoopertweets @resnikoff Pretty sure Macron was trolling Trump with the invite knowing he couldn't say no to the pomp & circumstance. "Look how they greet me in !"
885481715124367361 2017-07-13 12:51:06 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @MalcolmNance Where are LEOs speaking out about this abusive behavior? Why does the thin blue line protect those who abuse their power from being removed?
885295087202312196 2017-07-12 00:29:31 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @chrislhayes In his defense, most times his closest advisers, family members and associates have no idea what Trump's doing either. #TrumpRussia

884949425210130432 2017-07-11 01:35:59 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @Alex_Panetta These are people with $$$ lawyers, no way they'd reveal this information now w/o a plan. DTJr is drawing fire from others. Pardon from dad.
884942510551969792 2017-07-11 01:08:30 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @Kris_Sacrebleu Trump:"I love the poorly educated". The GOP preys on these folks, putting fear in them with 3Gs-Guns, God & Gays. Then use power for more $$
884935933602254848 2017-07-11 00:42:22 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @MaxineWaters Mueller pulls off Trump's mask to reveal Putin saying, I would've gotten away with it too if not for you dang Dems. Fox News: Proves Nothing
884486195866210305 2017-07-10 18:55:16 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @ChelseaClinton CHELSEA FOR PRES... I didn't know that was an option, but I'd take it. Right... NOW! #25thAmmendmentNow
884417871731970048 2017-07-10 14:23:46 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @HallieJackson @morningmoneyben Trump clearly didn't raise his kids. He's the weak parent w/ an obnoxious kid who counts: 1..2..2.5...2.999; Vlad, here's candy if you stop
883344674903261185 2017-07-07 15:19:16 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @mitchellreports @NBCNews Notice how he doesn't even attempt to shove Putin's arm out of its socket like he does to every other world leader?
883126240344977408 2017-07-06 00:51:18 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @SMShow @ezlusztig Trump: What's wrong with golden showers? I even have golden toilets. Merkel: that's NOT what's on the video, Donald. Trump: Oh $h!t
883121685574160384 2017-07-06 00:33:12 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @POTUS @michaelbeatty3 @tarafinnbull Yeah, that sounds vaguely familiar...pic.twitter.com/GYKIkUcFlU

876459695078297600 2017-06-18 15:20:49 UTC <PSU_Blaze> Blame Obama for current tone in DC. His presidency brought bigots/racists out of the dark. Then they elected Trump the "tone setter". #AMJoy

875083439212515329 2017-06-14 20:12:04 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @HillaryClinton @funder Trump also said this about Hillary's bodyguards: "Take their guns away. She doesn't want guns. Let's see what happens to her."
874735068178264064 2017-06-13 21:07:46 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @amjoyshow This just made me an even bigger fan of #DubNation.
874732414907674629 2017-06-13 20:57:14 UTC <PSU_Blaze> @Lawrence That's because @SenKamalaHarris was on the right track. A simple question deserves a yes or no, not "I don't recall" even after preparations
