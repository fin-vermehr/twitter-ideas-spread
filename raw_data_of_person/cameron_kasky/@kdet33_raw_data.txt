971748228776460288 2018-03-08 14:03:26 UTC <kdet33> @MSNBC Trump said he knows so much about hacking, maybe he can find them.

971395268762656768 2018-03-07 14:40:54 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump The fact that trump endorsed it, means one less sale for your wifes book.

971013121447006209 2018-03-06 13:22:23 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @JackPosobiec Trump high energy? Think not. Man who stuffs cheeseburgers and fries in mouth and cant even walk the 18 holes when hes golfing. And as often as he golfs youd think hed mastered that. High energy is a joke

Just lip service and lining her own pockets.  At every turn she has had the chance to support and shes remained silent.

968118689018142720 2018-02-26 13:40:56 UTC <kdet33> @FLOTUS @EdKrassen Shes hiding because she has more proof her husband is a philander, even though she knew that when she married him. She knew he was married when she started w/ him.  You know that old dogs and new tricks. Shes as morally bankrupt as him

The fact that you are more worried about how they talk about someone or some perceive respect they owe,  says all we need to know about you.
967033198306873344 2018-02-23 13:47:35 UTC <kdet33> @g1gary @activist360 I asked the same question and crickets, no one has tried to defend. Wonder why? Because no defense.

966673427225509888 2018-02-22 13:57:59 UTC <kdet33> @JoeNBC dont give president any credit. Its all lip service and I dont believe a word or tweet he says. Again duped.

966646757173145600 2018-02-22 12:12:00 UTC <kdet33> @CNN @WVFreedomCaucus His response was so eloquent, the audiences response says different. Hes a paid hack and the crap about money follows issues is a lie. He follows the money. Power and money all that matter. Dead kids dont.
966646033563471872 2018-02-22 12:09:08 UTC <kdet33> @CNN @AprilGRocks Facts can be your friend. Just because trump lies doesnt make it right for everyone.

966608041905983488 2018-02-22 09:38:10 UTC <kdet33> @toddstarnes US senators ridicule US citizens everyday. When they choose to go against our wishes and pay off their debt to the NRA, so what goes around comes around. Those kids deserve all the praise & support we can give them. U not so much.

966490183419023361 2018-02-21 01:49:50 UTC <kdet33> @JackiSchechner @Iamhisboyelroy Yeah because Obama never meet with grieving parents or went to funerals.  God how disgusting

If the man has been affected by the things that are going on, you dont need notes. Hes going through some motions to try and keep this under control. You just keep supporting him and when it goes south - guess what?  Thoughts and prayers

963004187545161728 2018-02-12 10:57:44 UTC <kdet33> @mitchellvii And we are pretty much going to assume you are an a*shole.
962880043667152896 2018-02-11 02:44:26 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @bmin @JamesMc30559324 @RGlennCooper1 @cindygold298 Yep he is.

For some reason they went after Clinton for years and years, but you think trump should be let off the hook after a year. Can we say hypocrisy?
962681779504197633 2018-02-11 13:36:36 UTC <kdet33> @BillOReilly @lilfinigan @DianneInIndiana You talking about trump huh?

962276465323757568 2018-02-10 10:46:02 UTC <kdet33> @nikkihaley @AshaRangappa_ @Deb6246 Joke right?

962267851825582080 2018-02-10 10:11:48 UTC <kdet33> @gpk3gpk @rationlconsumer @sometingfishy I think it was McConnell who said that they would do anything necessary to make sure Obama was a 1 term president. Whos whiny? Who holds on to hate? The hypocrisy is astounding.
962163347557965824 2018-02-09 03:16:32 UTC <kdet33> @ABC Maybe because youre a hack for trump and continue to spread lies.
962162950785196037 2018-02-09 03:14:58 UTC <kdet33> @HilaryClinton @SenFeinstein @mcforgod OMG keep up. You just spewing old talking points that have been disproved.  Youd think youre running as scared as trump. Lame

961920756341968896 2018-02-09 11:12:34 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Hey Donny, same thing I just said to jr. You never met a lie you didnt like.
961918355778220032 2018-02-09 11:03:02 UTC <kdet33> @DonaldJTrumpJr Hey Donny, have you ever met a lie you didnt like?
961907060152700928 2018-02-09 10:18:09 UTC <kdet33> @RealJamesWoods Never met a lie you didnt like jimmy huh?
961897599577010176 2018-02-09 09:40:33 UTC <kdet33> @washingtonpost @edwardmtz7 Way to early for some people to be up. Go back to sleep and wake up with a rational thought.
961886564086370305 2018-02-09 08:56:42 UTC <kdet33> @TheEconomist @ErlTyriss Yeah sure, when Ryan says he wont bring a bill to the floor unless trump will sign. Hows that for governing?  Republicans have delayed budgets and immigration reform for years. Just using this a reason to hate on her.
961815337518821376 2018-02-08 04:13:40 UTC <kdet33> @AC360 @jimsciutto @robjh1 And by the way the problems with Ryan, Nunes, McConnell, trump, Kelly and so on and so on.
961812557211185153 2018-02-08 04:02:37 UTC <kdet33> @thehill @Sanderstrong16 @NatAmRepublican Im part of the nation, please dont speak for me. But now that you brought it up, the shot we nee, is to watch trump and his admin being dragged out in hand cuffs.
961757953111023617 2018-02-08 00:25:39 UTC <kdet33> @JackiSchechner I look at it this way, if things are really that bad, she had an obligation as a citizen to inform the public. Otherwise shes playing to the camera and is really bad at it.
961705313090064385 2018-02-08 20:56:28 UTC <kdet33> @POTUS @VP @twittmypants @haystakfan1 @DioneSmith13 Ha ha ha. They are both a disgrace. Snowflakes turn into avalanches. Bye

961598112698720261 2018-02-08 13:50:30 UTC <kdet33> @VP @twittmypants @haystakfan1 Really. Trump has spent more in 1 yr than Obama spent in 8. My god got your head out of the sand. You are being duped. If you choose to believe the lies, good luck to u. Its really ugly now, but at least Ill see whats coming.
961547908347760640 2018-02-08 10:31:00 UTC <kdet33> @WalshFreedom @kawaii433 @Mel_Ankoly @cbradleytodd Wrong there. Trump is the master of fabrication.  But youve already shown facts dont matter.  Hope that works out for you.
961546662920499202 2018-02-08 10:26:03 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @NaomiRJohnson @Bco93Williams @AusetNefertiti She then brought her parents here to live. Neither has a degree. They dont meet trumps criteria, it qualifies as chain migration. Oh yeah, but their white. Hypocrisy is astounding
961389128951660544 2018-02-07 00:00:04 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Do you know the meaning of bombshell?  Oh I know your people are lying to you again.
961229440733925376 2018-02-07 13:25:32 UTC <kdet33> @suntanwoody Our states going to hell in a hand basket.

961184463605698560 2018-02-07 10:26:48 UTC <kdet33> @SenSanders @DSnelsonSmith @Fltlanderiam1 Lets see, seems I heard McConnell say to republicans in 2009, our goal is to make Obama a one term president. Blindly following orders, instead of making our country better. Hypocrisy is astounding by you trumpers.

961037234051997696 2018-02-06 00:41:46 UTC <kdet33> @HardballChris @MichaelSteele @admiralmpj No honor among thieves. Everyone who lies for trump is complicit
961029860348047360 2018-02-06 00:12:28 UTC <kdet33> @TomiLahren @PattyArquette @jonesc1978 Tell that to trump and Fox News. They dont seem to think anyone should have an opinion different than trump. Such hypocrisy
961029000889098241 2018-02-06 00:09:03 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec - youre a frickin liar. God hell isnt big enough for all you so called Christians.https://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/961005854861520897
961013651112124417 2018-02-06 23:08:03 UTC <kdet33> @ananavarro @cheesepickles @sp1r1tharambe Obstruction of justice, over and over and over.  I suspect you know that, just dont want to admit.  Im sure hannity and others told you its all Obamas or Hillarys fault. So go on believing. Bye
961012407463276545 2018-02-06 23:03:07 UTC <kdet33> @ananavarro @cheesepickles @sp1r1tharambe Might want to apply those same thoughts to trump. He wouldnt know legal if it smacked him in the face.  And besides you only want white immigration, like trump.
961008821186584577 2018-02-06 22:48:52 UTC <kdet33> @ananavarro @AnnAguayo Kelly is so wrong on many subjects. Being a decent human being is not on his radar
961008621567070208 2018-02-06 22:48:04 UTC <kdet33> @ananavarro @cheesepickles @sp1r1tharambe Its called being human
960927937355763713 2018-02-06 17:27:28 UTC <kdet33> @NWSNewYorkNY My daughter also got Tsunami warning in Wilmington NC this morning. WTF

960821381637312513 2018-02-06 10:24:03 UTC <kdet33> @EdKrassen Thought he didnt look at the info?   The hope I have is that all this crap coming from him, is showing hes nearing the point when hell go right off the deep end and run screaming from congress.
960696715362873344 2018-02-05 02:08:40 UTC <kdet33> @maggieNYT @nytmike @Cavalry6 Blah blah blah. Turn the channel, listen to something other than fox.  Trumps toast, the earlier you accept it the easier it will be.
960696081943355392 2018-02-05 02:06:09 UTC <kdet33> @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell I didnt even turn it on, if that makes me a traitor, guess Ill take it. But really do think the traitors were the fools clapping like they just saw a seal doing a trick at Sea World.
960692699459477506 2018-02-05 01:52:43 UTC <kdet33> @RVAwonk Sarah lied - please say it aint so. I know, no one can. Lying is her strong point. She should go down with the rest of them.
960686241065914369 2018-02-05 01:27:03 UTC <kdet33> @RepTomGarrett saw you on air today. Sir you are a hack and just added to the list of traitors in our government. Disgusting

960569154414759936 2018-02-05 17:41:47 UTC <kdet33> @CNN My husband was in London and had what they thought was a heart attack. He wa taken immediately to hospital. Given great care and walked out with out paying a $. He as an American was treated better there than in his own country.

960502537072926721 2018-02-05 13:17:04 UTC <kdet33> @RepSwalwell @mhornyak I second that.
960502077721063425 2018-02-05 13:15:15 UTC <kdet33> @thehill @j_pelota Ten seconds after the sham of a memo came out, we learned that the FISA court knew it was partly was funded in part as opposition research. What should scare every American is how gullible you trumpers are, in the face of the truth

If people would have paid real attention to her platform and not the damn email lies, we wouldnt be in this mess. If lying was the tipping point for Clinton why are we not seeing and exodus from trump. Hate thats why
960140326718640128 2018-02-04 13:17:47 UTC <kdet33> @frodofied @OuiserB_NC @tbw24431703 Come back when you have some life experience and can back up your drivel with facts. Geez.

959977434107039744 2018-02-03 02:30:30 UTC <kdet33> @dbongino @jsholt1 Whatever it takes to get you through the day. Did you happen to read the latest on Carter Page, his own words, he was an advisor to the Kremlin. Funny how he ended up in trumps team. Traitors all of you!
959972412900216832 2018-02-03 02:10:33 UTC <kdet33> @dbongino @jsholt1 No actually 4 people have been arrested. Gates, Manafort, Flynn and Popadopolous.

959734832329887745 2018-02-03 10:26:29 UTC <kdet33> @AriMelber @TXTrumpFan Nunes, trump and the rest of the Republican Party wouldnt know transparency if they had a memo written to explain it to them. Theyre playing their supporters and in the process destroying the US. And guess what youre helping. Good job
959625571813806081 2018-02-02 03:12:19 UTC <kdet33> @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity You mean the 2 republican hacks who are some of the most hateful people in congress?  Oh wow arent you lucky

959495083862216707 2018-02-02 18:33:49 UTC <kdet33> @SarahHuckabee Talking about your boss Sarah?
959406921076834304 2018-02-02 12:43:29 UTC <kdet33> @IvankaTrump @littlemiss4shop Why, because shes shown to lie as easily as her dad. This is just Lip service from her. She doesnt care about black history month, minoritys or even you.
959401883986284544 2018-02-02 12:23:28 UTC <kdet33> @thehill Hes just flat out lying. Seems hes doing exactly what trump does. Please Ryan is as guilty as the rest and will pay the price with the rest of them.

You and republicans allow Americans to be slaughtered by other Americans and thats ok huh?  11 school shootings in January and non by immigrant terrorists.  The NRA is a terrorist organization and you support. Know what that says about you?

956255069174943744 2018-01-24 19:59:09 UTC <kdet33> @galinja Obviously not. The learning curve is huge with men like this. If let are capable of learning at all.

955854645624213505 2018-01-23 17:28:01 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @TGowdySC @RepRatcliffe This is what your going with huh?  CYA in full gear, what they have on you sweetie ?

955429469711486976 2018-01-22 13:18:31 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump That makes no frickin sense, but then consider the source! You
955419664334680064 2018-01-22 12:39:33 UTC <kdet33> @thedailybeast I dont think it took a book or Bannon to tell must of us that.
955418641067102208 2018-01-22 12:35:29 UTC <kdet33> @DonaldJTrumpJr Hey Donny boy, did all republicans vote?  I know math is hard, but no they didnt. So if you cant get your whole party to vote, theres a problem. Not the Dems.
955395754440392705 2018-01-22 11:04:32 UTC <kdet33> @RodneyRohde @ValaAfshar @HAISurvivor Please explain why a child brought here by no fault of his own, should be deported to a country they have no connection to? And explain how any of the dreamers are affecting your life?  Its pure hate thats all
955392369888825344 2018-01-22 10:51:05 UTC <kdet33> @POTUS @VP Youre lying and whats really sad is youre stupid enough to think people dont know the truth. They read, they see, they saw McConnell refusing to bring bill to floor. Trump is refusing to pay our troops and you have the nerve 2 stand in front of them & lie
955391164726857729 2018-01-22 10:46:18 UTC <kdet33> @CNNPolitics @curtisfrith Yep going with the premise of your profile. How did bernie create anything?
955347521420910592 2018-01-21 07:52:53 UTC <kdet33> @ArcMinnied @JamieRJN You mention God in ur profile.  But your words seem to imply u havent a clue about God. Such hate for a women who has done nothing to u & has been harassed 4 years, nothing proven. But u support proven liar, cheater, grifter in WH. Might as well be a BOT
955290202133671936 2018-01-21 04:05:07 UTC <kdet33> @Shareblue He lies, like trump, about things that are easily checked and verified. Hes betting most people wont check it. Theyll just believe what he says.  We have to hold them accountable for every lie.
955256916166479874 2018-01-21 01:52:51 UTC <kdet33> @FBI @GOP @NY2BOS73 Because it doesnt exist. Piss poor attempt by Nunes to cover himself and trump. He knows hes complicit in, as trump says, this Russia thing.

955254960899411968 2018-01-21 01:45:05 UTC <kdet33> @RepMarkMeadows - embarrassing NC again. And oh by the way, lying is not good.https://twitter.com/kasiedc/status/955254443964092417
955254303786225664 2018-01-21 01:42:28 UTC <kdet33> @thehill @Niatherefugee @RAB1ONE66 Think you confused a bit. 4 indictments and 2 pleas. But please lets go back and look at the time and money wasted on Bengazhi. Come back in 2 years or do if still going on.
955253317294272512 2018-01-21 01:38:33 UTC <kdet33> @SRuhle If the deals are being shot down by Miller and Kelly can we infer that trump is not able to govern this country, if others are making decisions?
955251381698531328 2018-01-21 01:30:51 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @StephansAshley @JohnnyAkzam Such attitude and a bad one at that. Way to gun up support. Fail!

955203430036975617 2018-01-21 22:20:19 UTC <kdet33> @guypbenson @mac_grain Hey. They have kept Dems out of every bit of legislation since trump took over. Lets talk about bipartisan and working together. You cant have it both ways. McConnell couldnt even get all his senators to vote for it.
955202940867956741 2018-01-21 22:18:22 UTC <kdet33> @KatiePavlich Yeah well go talk to trump about Pocahontas, then come back and whine some more.
955202663796346880 2018-01-21 22:17:16 UTC <kdet33> @KimStrassel Nunes hands on this, is about as credible as his midnight ride to the WH.

955071232533245953 2018-01-21 13:35:00 UTC <kdet33> @girlsreallyrule I didnt think Jared and Ivanka worked on the sabbath?  They made a exception because trump shut down the government land smiling about it no less. Or my choice its an old picture that they tried to use to influence their low info supporters
955067689730441218 2018-01-21 13:20:56 UTC <kdet33> @VABVOX Welcome to the 2018 Republican Party. Anyone who doesnt speak against this hate is complicit. No and ifs or buts. Now on the catty side , wheres a good lightning strike when you need it.

955045213038399488 2018-01-21 11:51:37 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec Ivanka and Jared working on the sabbath these days. Or maybe this is an old picture. Valentines on bulletin board. You guys are a joke and really bad at lying
955042409838243846 2018-01-21 11:40:28 UTC <kdet33> @JenAshleyWright @sulli999 @FlorenciaValleM @imchristiepitts @USA1stTFM Do you understand how utterly uniformed you sound?  Do you care?
955041974054203392 2018-01-21 11:38:45 UTC <kdet33> @JenAshleyWright @MaggieMay777 @VOICEBOXSM7 Your profile says stop read learn. Didnt follow your own advice huh?  Geez
955041639793414144 2018-01-21 11:37:25 UTC <kdet33> @JenAshleyWright @MaggieMay777 You really didnt ask they did you?
955039958221418496 2018-01-21 11:30:44 UTC <kdet33> @HoarseWisperer @NorthofXLIX @ImmoralGOP Oh come to NC. Were trying to overtake Texas for assine and hateful legislation.
955038732171739136 2018-01-21 11:25:52 UTC <kdet33> @POTUS @GovMikeHuckabee You make yourself look more foolish and delusional everyday. This is what youve come to, shilling for the liar in the WH. Wow, what a class act you are.
955037184666619904 2018-01-21 11:19:43 UTC <kdet33> @SenBobCasey @Schzaam70Steve Deflecting wont work on this one. #TrumpShutdown. They own it
955036861658955777 2018-01-21 11:18:26 UTC <kdet33> @SenBobCasey @DNOGU860 @f_anzoategui19 @LgFski @jennstrobel @mariapa1776 @grahamtripp2go They seem to gloss over that point every time. They obviously enjoyed being lied to
955036618372591616 2018-01-21 11:17:28 UTC <kdet33> @SenBobCasey @f_anzoategui19 No its trumps and the republicans fault. They dont and never planned to negotiate in good faith. Dont believe their lies
955033972194578433 2018-01-21 11:06:57 UTC <kdet33> @Adaripp @realchasewhite And I dont believe 3 times = countless.  His thinking evolved, something that doesnt happen on the right.
955032641623019520 2018-01-21 11:01:40 UTC <kdet33> @jaketapper @kotuzak If Nunes has had his hands on it, its a scam and youre falling for it. Doesnt it get tiring believing the lies from the disaster in the WH and his lackeys in congress
955032191989317632 2018-01-21 10:59:52 UTC <kdet33> @jaketapper @ADikHurricane Really, you cant allow for anything else to be important than the ass in the WH?
955031557475053568 2018-01-21 10:57:21 UTC <kdet33> @jaketapper @Jimmybo62868157 @t_rock1171 If Nunes is involved its suspect from the start. Hes trying to cover his ass. Hes in this Russia thing( as trump calls it) up to his neck. But keep believing
955029564224409600 2018-01-21 10:49:26 UTC <kdet33> @Adaripp @Alyssafarah The tone of your tweet is a tad bit condescending and accusatory. Deliberately misread huh?  But then look at the hypocrite you work for.
955020914080538624 2018-01-21 10:15:04 UTC <kdet33> @casanova_kara Pictures are worth a 1000 words.
955020679367282689 2018-01-21 10:14:08 UTC <kdet33> @mattmfm @iamgreenbean @davitydave @LeoRules1 And none of the ACA problems youre willing to lay st the feet of repubs. They offered 100s of amendments that were taken into account and then wouldnt support bill.  NC did you no favors when McCory and repubs wouldnt expand Medicare.
955017856915304449 2018-01-21 10:02:55 UTC <kdet33> @ChrisMurphyCT @CharlesBarone @Kress_Sandy Is that not how his party has been acting all last year?  Groups go behind closed doors and dont include their own party let alone the Dems. Graham only doing what their norm is. Besides repubs knew there was a bipartisan deal in the works.
955016434656083969 2018-01-21 09:57:16 UTC <kdet33> @chrislhayes @ChrisMurphyCT @puzzled_yet @puro_gringo @duckinspokane Did you pay attention to what the republicans did the 8 years Obama was in office?  It was disgraceful and they never once put country over party. The only way to bring dignity back is to vote them out.
954990802488496128 2018-01-21 08:15:24 UTC <kdet33> @SenateGOP @SenDuckworth Thank you for your service and calling out the president and GOP as the obstructionist they are
954989972494454784 2018-01-21 08:12:06 UTC <kdet33> @HuffPost Ok if ISIS masterminded the shooting, then the GOP is contradicting trump and his BS that they have beaten ISIS. That and under his watch we have had a terrorist attack on our soil.  These people are really really stupid.
954987951934623744 2018-01-21 08:04:05 UTC <kdet33> @morganarae @MrDane1982 @OnlyKnews Me thinks youre the one who cant see, you just gave a non answer. Because I said so isnt proof.
954986961307041793 2018-01-21 08:00:09 UTC <kdet33> @EricBoehlert @Copernicus2013 Um her made sure that was put forth. Yes congress agreed, unlike McConnell who wouldnt let it be voted on.  This is a gop problem, they own it and no amount of twisting is going to make it otherwise.
954986408493703168 2018-01-20 07:57:57 UTC <kdet33> @EricBoehlert @M5B1tch @georgiegirl1216 No sir you are wrong
954986314193166336 2018-01-20 07:57:34 UTC <kdet33> @EricBoehlert @M5B1tch @georgiegirl1216 Bill put forth to pay military and McConnell killed it, thats how you get there.
954965570591559680 2018-01-20 06:35:09 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec - what about it?  Think you just got caught in another lie https://twitter.com/christinawilkie/status/954963343927889920

954921876769435650 2018-01-20 03:41:31 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec One quick question Sarah, who the f*ck do you think you are?  You just a lying mouthpiece for a lying president.
954920557967036416 2018-01-20 03:36:17 UTC <kdet33> @Alyssa_Milano @Cernovich @maydaymindy9 @realHeatherD God Im almost 60, what would he say about me.
954918746921062401 2018-01-20 03:29:05 UTC <kdet33> @CharlesPPierce I know your talking BB, but have you seen McConnell and R Paul. Think KY lost a long time ago
954918320578482176 2018-01-20 03:27:23 UTC <kdet33> @HillaryWarnedUs @MericaSavin Wow. Snappy comeback. Such an embarrassment
954912762194427905 2018-01-20 03:05:18 UTC <kdet33> @thehill @RepStevenSmith Again, are you a frickin adult? You do not deserve to represent anyone, you are despicable. You dont hold a candle to either Obama or Tammy Duckwoth. Shame on you
954905325358010368 2018-01-20 02:35:45 UTC <kdet33> @HillaryWarnedUs @neeratanden Me

954873785865424896 2018-01-20 00:30:25 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @SenBobCasey @ScottKimball 
954873188214853632 2018-01-20 00:28:03 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec @therealsusanq Seems to me dem senator wanted to stop congress from being paid- guess what lying Mitch wouldnt bring to floor. Greedy disgusting old white man. Repubs own this, no matter what the spin
954872741919952897 2018-01-20 00:26:17 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec @catherinemccoin @dianegall @DeplorableDMB Maybe its implied since 2 of 3 wives used so called chain migration. Idiot
954872493986238464 2018-01-20 00:25:17 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec @catherinemccoin @DeplorableDMB Hey sweetie, they couldnt even get all the republicans to back it. But thats just details huh?  Misogynistic jerk!
954872182706003968 2018-01-20 00:24:03 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec Yeah, like all those FBI employees you talked to right?  Trump shut down the government, he owns it. And just in case you dont know, history is not going to be good to you.
954871660980703232 2018-01-20 00:21:59 UTC <kdet33> @jasoninthehouse Hey Jason. You ran off scared with your tail between your legs. How about if we care what you think, well ask. Bye!

954843736726474753 2018-01-20 22:31:01 UTC <kdet33> @CNNPolitics Imagine that!  A trump admin rep lying. They arent fooling anyone, except maybe there low information supporters

954703998212362240 2018-01-20 13:15:45 UTC <kdet33> @David_J_Bier @Mike121948 No its going to greatly reduce support for republicans who are the majority and cant get their act together in their own party.
954688541090512896 2018-01-20 12:14:20 UTC <kdet33> @POTUS @PressSec @JeffreyGuterman @Fricat @ChrisButIer He told her to abort and she refused.  But please explain to me why trump can reform be forgiven for part deeds, but god forbid a person who served his debt to society cant be allowed to vote again?  Hypocrisy is stunning with you people
954687867376283648 2018-01-20 12:11:39 UTC <kdet33> @POTUS @PressSec @SLSmith000 @HannersPhillip Sounds like something only a man would say.  Like every woman wants trump.

Gen Kelly sabotaged the deal after he learned there was one on the table. He admitted it on so called Fox News. The only thing thats anti-American is trump
954273068444200960 2018-01-19 08:43:23 UTC <kdet33> @AngelaLMorabito BS. Repubs and trump own this. They could have funded CHIP program months ago. They are using it as a bargaining chip. They dont give a f*ck about childrens health and obviously u dont either, youre will to shill for them and lie.

954166051805253634 2018-01-18 01:38:08 UTC <kdet33> @SheriffClarke Why should he treat her any different? Shes a cabinet member and a liar like the rest. If it was a man would you be running your mouth. And besides shes a grown up, Im sure she doesnt need you to defend her honor. If she does shes not qualified to be sec

954150732655202306 2018-01-18 00:37:16 UTC <kdet33> @SenRonJohnson you sir are a hateful human and a traitor to our country. You ought to be ashamed, but you dont have the human moral compass for that.
954149890061463553 2018-01-18 00:33:55 UTC <kdet33> @mmfa I can think of a few others who ought to go !

954143543727214593 2018-01-18 00:08:42 UTC <kdet33> Just heard Chris Matthews say Trumps speech was a barn burner today.  Had to turn the channel. Why why why does he dsy this crap. Trumps burning down this country and not in a good way.

953960581320642560 2018-01-18 12:01:40 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @HopeRadio1 @TalbertSwan @lorilynn19 @ceceyy Again when you cant defend trump, bring a Clinton into it. This is 2018 and we have an disaster running our country. This is the problem along with people excusing trump
953959893500878848 2018-01-18 11:58:56 UTC <kdet33> @maggieNYT @Docbterry1 @TrinaLee85 @DeepwaterPierat 33% is huge and diverse?

953954973217443841 2018-01-18 11:39:23 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen @VoineaJohn The will of the American people elected Hillary. The electoral college elected trump.  Big frickin difference.
953940117927972864 2018-01-18 10:40:22 UTC <kdet33> @NormOrnstein All the people who said Kelly was the adult in the room, need to rethink that. There are no adults in this admin. The brazen lying is a disgrace and it diminishes us a little more everyday.
953935071072964608 2018-01-18 10:20:18 UTC <kdet33> @RealRonHoward @daisymay201789 Obviously you dont care. Hope the man you your life doesnt treat you like trump has treated the women in his. But if he does guess you have to be ok with it huh?
953934452262100992 2018-01-18 10:17:51 UTC <kdet33> @RealRonHoward @TomPistone Even Fox shelved the story before the election.  The man has proven over and over hes a racist, lying, cheating pig. He cheated on wife #1, wife #2 why do you think hed stop there?
953933240347381761 2018-01-18 10:13:02 UTC <kdet33> @VABVOX @228Years He called nazis good people. No thats not racist or offensive. If your do proud of your beliefs why not show your face and real name on profile instead of hiding behind the flag?
953827471832514561 2018-01-17 03:12:45 UTC <kdet33> @NewDay What a load of crap. Republicans and trump will own it, lock stock and barrel!

953567841197883392 2018-01-17 10:01:04 UTC <kdet33> @SecNielsen watched you today. Sorry excuse for a leader and a women. Youll go down with trump for supporting his racist policies. Smart woman would resign now.

952344664228683777 2018-01-13 01:00:36 UTC <kdet33> @mschlapp You competing with trump to see who can tell the biggest lies?  Because you are lying.
952344354793971713 2018-01-13 00:59:22 UTC <kdet33> @OfficialJonZal @Gabalaba22 Maybe you should tweet the same thing to @PressSec and @POTUS.

951421715556569088 2018-01-11 11:53:08 UTC <kdet33> @UnfollowTrump Not full story though.  Left out some really important info.  49% think its due to Obama, 40% trump.  But what the hell, its only details.
951408208584814593 2018-01-11 10:59:27 UTC <kdet33> @dbongino The only squirming thats being done is trump and the traitors trying to protect him. Oh and you, must be do hard to twist yourself into position to believe this crap.
951407813875716096 2018-01-11 10:57:53 UTC <kdet33> @DonaldJTrumpJr @dbongino @Barbavh Thank god youre retired and not teaching children anymore. Teachers should engage in facts and they seemed to have escaped you. But good luck when trump and repubs take away ur ss, Medicare. Hope that teachers retirement can support u. So sad
951406704368979968 2018-01-11 10:53:29 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec God can you go a day without lying?  We all see the info you reference and the fact you leave out the real facts. Kind of like leaving wholes sentences out of official transcripts. Must get hard looking in the mirror, because theres a liar looking back.
951400910915293184 2018-01-11 10:30:27 UTC <kdet33> @ChrisCuomo @heartsandparts Reasonable and republicans, now those are 2 words that dont belong in same sentence.
951399434897764352 2018-01-11 10:24:36 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BuzzFeedNews @MichaelCohen212 Exactly enough is enough. Your self righteous attitude is disgusting. You played with fire and got caught.
951398779743326208 2018-01-11 10:21:59 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC And your whole purpose is to kiss his a*s. What do they have on you?   So sad for our country, as you continue to betray everyday. Look in the mirror, its getting ugly.

950876386419392512 2018-01-09 23:46:11 UTC <kdet33> @WalshFreedom Hey joe.  FU
950694907076898818 2018-01-09 11:45:03 UTC <kdet33> @NYCanegirl We all knew something not right, but you have to take joe with a grain of salt because they fawned all over him. If he knew he had a duty to let American people know.
950693716246876160 2018-01-09 11:40:19 UTC <kdet33> @CNN @kailashwg One question. Are you responsible for the actions of all your friends?  Dont think so, hard concept I know.  Truly clueless.
950690696494747648 2018-01-09 11:28:19 UTC <kdet33> @Oprah @davematt88 @EdKrassen @Spitfirehill Yeah like all the congress people and people in trumps admin. They should know and are helping him burn it down.
950686141648392193 2018-01-09 11:10:13 UTC <kdet33> @SRuhle Now Stephanie you know that went right over juniors head. Critical thought not big in that family.
950668640684306432 2018-01-09 10:00:41 UTC <kdet33> @Acosta @MrTacoGT @OneOfWe1776 @LvlyWords Policy talk. He gave them the privilege of voting for him. Wow what policy does that fall under?
950667825953280001 2018-01-09 09:57:26 UTC <kdet33> @lrozen @Acosta @tigerlilymom @JammieWF @Lorraine_E Another right wing fortune teller, they know all. To bad they cant see trump is toast.
950666837179682821 2018-01-09 09:53:31 UTC <kdet33> @axios @My2Two2Cents @waltshaub @drc573 @SamSanderson123 @paint2go BINGO!
950665862717018112 2018-01-09 09:49:38 UTC <kdet33> @EdKrassen Lets see, both tv personalities, Oprah has double his years plus better ratings. She really is a self made billionaire. He just plays one in the WH.  Oh I know Sean shes a woman and POC, thats why shes not qualified.  He hasnt learned to shut up
950664728883363840 2018-01-09 09:45:08 UTC <kdet33> @RepSwalwell No self awareness with this one.  She truly lives in bubble, think its going to burst soon.
950563974189379584 2018-01-08 03:04:46 UTC <kdet33> @Oprah @IvankaTrump OMG can you be more out of touch. Daddy is an abuser. Tell him times up. Then come back and try to be sincere.
950547278678380544 2018-01-08 01:58:26 UTC <kdet33> @charliekirk11 Nope, hes not. Never was, never will be.
950544509930213376 2018-01-08 01:47:26 UTC <kdet33> @TheDemocrats @NBCNews @Semperfelix @darylsturgis @BobSmith4152 Maybe you should rethink who should  oh just stop!
950543444778323968 2018-01-08 01:43:12 UTC <kdet33> @4everNeverTrump @PCSlade @wimbalist Yeah hes a real sports aficionado.
950529389737009152 2018-01-08 00:47:21 UTC <kdet33> @HillaryClinton @VABVOX You would think that @JasonMillerinDC would have more important things to worry and talk about since he was on the trump transition team.
950526519381843970 2018-01-08 00:35:56 UTC <kdet33> @seanhannity @FoxNews @seanspicer Who the frick cares. Two liars spewing more lies. Think I can find something better to do.
950519085707735041 2018-01-08 00:06:24 UTC <kdet33> @nytopinion OMG enough already. You already have the talking points trumpers use. Ask some real important questions to people who have problems because of trump. Dreamers, vets, people losing insurance, minorities.
950518284805443584 2018-01-08 00:03:13 UTC <kdet33> @nytimes @peterdaou @JesseRikart @abarrios0091 There was no thinking other than theyve been brainwashed to think Hillary was a criminal and god forbid we ever repeat another nlsck president.
950515574655848450 2018-01-08 23:52:27 UTC <kdet33> @NBCNews OMG did you learn nothing?
950442649957396481 2018-01-08 19:02:40 UTC <kdet33> @4everNeverTrump OMG could it be any worse than we have now.  She is bright compassionate and truly is a self made person. She is everything trump is not. No experience, thats rich.
950266528561352704 2018-01-07 07:22:50 UTC <kdet33> @AlanDersh @catsim7 @foxandfriends @suesuesbeo9 And you know this how?
950168118227324928 2018-01-07 00:51:47 UTC <kdet33> @TomiLahren @_beNbackwards @JaimePrimak @Larakate @VicMonte Misogyny much?  So out of touch
950146884777205760 2018-01-07 23:27:24 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Wrong Donny, again. Miller got destroyed and sat there and whined, kind of like you do.
950026764843143168 2018-01-07 15:30:06 UTC <kdet33> @EdKrassen Or the definition of self made and sure many people disagree with his revolutionizing reality tv. What a creepy little hack.
949946353232343045 2018-01-07 10:10:34 UTC <kdet33> @perlmutations @Cam1356 They cant move on, they have no plan. Trump doesnt care and repubs cant govern. So smoke and mirrors it is, until we take them out in November.
949945878999195648 2018-01-07 10:08:41 UTC <kdet33> @JudgeJeanine Hey judge. Hell isnt big enough for all you people.  Just remember karmas a bitch honey.
949945432582565888 2018-01-07 10:06:54 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump First its mental INSTABILITY and second you do know Reagan did have Alzheimers ?  Think you just proved the point.
949805244669710336 2018-01-06 00:49:51 UTC <kdet33> @HoarseWisperer Oh well, Ill have free time

949778276851027969 2018-01-06 23:02:41 UTC <kdet33> @tonyposnanski If turnaround the sun means having to drive to see daddy and don jr when theyre locked up, then I hope its wonderful.
949777558568136704 2018-01-06 22:59:50 UTC <kdet33> @POLITICOMag Blah blah blah. Who cares. Cant believe anyone is pences friend.

949766173708648449 2018-01-06 22:14:36 UTC <kdet33> @DanRather Guess he aint  got it 
949486922015133696 2018-01-05 03:44:57 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @TalbertSwan Donny is a simple man and they means he can dish it out but cant take it.
949442827381039104 2018-01-05 00:49:44 UTC <kdet33> @WalshFreedom Nope its not ok.
949301330891374594 2018-01-05 15:27:29 UTC <kdet33> @krassenstein This is the kind of logic his supporters think is going to save them.  Ha ha ha.
949298685334249473 2018-01-05 15:16:58 UTC <kdet33> @NatashaBertrand @RepAdamSchiff now is not a moment too soon. Please do it.
949290725480587264 2018-01-05 14:45:20 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Phony book shouldnt garner your continuous meltdowns and denials.  Guess that means its true and your really screwed.
949277469407956994 2018-01-05 13:52:40 UTC <kdet33> @funder You are so right, but the facts seem to have a way of going right over his head.
949249314739638273 2018-01-05 12:00:47 UTC <kdet33> @Shareblue 3,2,1. Benghazi !
949248714169835520 2018-01-05 11:58:24 UTC <kdet33> @MarshaBlackburn Are you in a race with trump to see who can put the most lies in a tweet?  Find yourself a new job and let someone who cares about America have your seat.
949244983571345408 2018-01-05 11:43:34 UTC <kdet33> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @JohnPaul_USA Funny how you deflect from the fact that trump is lying again. He let Wolff have access to WH. Thought he was going to get a glowing puff piece on how wonderful he is. He got his ass handed to him.
949237378207633408 2018-01-05 11:13:21 UTC <kdet33> @thinkprogress @think4urself8 Whos programmed?  Duh
949224272110682114 2018-01-05 10:21:16 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Then you run one hell of a shit show Donnie. God give it up now and go away.

949107528356507648 2018-01-04 02:37:22 UTC <kdet33> @CNN @RobinBrenizer Different day, same lying sh*t
949085973215924226 2018-01-04 01:11:43 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @ronaldkd Did you need is before the 1st black man won?  Ive voted in every election since 1976 and was never an issue. At least you put your bigotry on full display.
949081473163898880 2018-01-04 00:53:50 UTC <kdet33> @FoxNews @seanhannity @TomiLahren Bless your heart honey. Just move on. You and Sean have way more to worry about. Try the crazy man in the WH. Seans probably going down too.
949059884007460865 2018-01-04 23:28:03 UTC <kdet33> @maggieNYT Oh Maggie, time to give it. Its just becoming sad.
949056226956070912 2018-01-04 23:13:31 UTC <kdet33> @tonyposnanski @nancyrbush Have consequences !
949014756752576514 2018-01-04 20:28:44 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec @Acosta Oh then please pray tell what us it?
949008742548373504 2018-01-04 20:04:50 UTC <kdet33> @thinkprogress Imagine that, Im shocked. He lied.
949008175675650050 2018-01-04 20:02:35 UTC <kdet33> @thehill @beehive1027 Haha ha. The biggest rumor monger in the WH, is trump himself. And he also lies.
949003695815086080 2018-01-04 19:44:47 UTC <kdet33> @JohnJHarwood Well Sarah spoke partial truth, shes not aware of a lot of things. Including the truth!
949002389159399424 2018-01-04 19:39:35 UTC <kdet33> @thehill @MaryLouElbert You still sticking to that story huh? So sad for you.
948925227282653186 2018-01-04 14:32:59 UTC <kdet33> @CNN You already tweeted about him this morning, whats up?  Why continue  to give this idiot time?  Enough.
948908363987013637 2018-01-04 13:25:58 UTC <kdet33> @peterbakernyt @nytimes @neeratanden @ThinSkinTrump Oh hes reinvented the presidency. Why anyone thinks its for the good is beyond me.  More scared of losing access than reporting the truth to the American people.
948907635117568006 2018-01-04 13:23:04 UTC <kdet33> @NewDay Stop with this guy!  He held a job for 10 days, does that make him an expert?  I cant watch and have to change the channel.
948724245202395137 2018-01-03 01:14:21 UTC <kdet33> @Alyssa_Milano @Vanessa36957644 Yeah sure like the right and republicans respected Obama. Or do we only have to respect traitors?  Again bye!
948722407073898496 2018-01-03 01:07:02 UTC <kdet33> @Alyssa_Milano @Vanessa36957644 No think you got that wrong honey.  Trump is the one who spends his days whining and complaining.  Kind of like his supporters. But hey whatever it takes to make you feel good. Us snowflakes can take it. Bye !!!
948721693706596352 2018-01-03 01:04:12 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec @peterbakernyt As if anyone would expect Sarah to tell the truth. Shes going to do this treasonous dance until they drag her out of the WH. Disgusting
948718928221655040 2018-01-03 00:53:13 UTC <kdet33> @DavidCornDC Thats what I keep saying. He may not like trump but he is a republican.
948718453514436615 2018-01-03 00:51:20 UTC <kdet33> @Alyssa_Milano @Vanessa36957644 Sure shes dealing with it, its called information, duh!
948715709248483333 2018-01-03 00:40:26 UTC <kdet33> They just are the most clueless bunch of traitors ever.
948690847159156739 2018-01-03 23:01:38 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec @Acosta @steph93065 Your talking trump admin and manners, thats rich!
948683948208611328 2018-01-03 22:34:13 UTC <kdet33> @DonaldJTrumpJr Have you not learned your lesson yet? Shut your mouth, your dad had squandered the privilege of serving this country. You people dont serve anyone but yourself s and it will land you in jail.
948624816172617728 2018-01-03 18:39:15 UTC <kdet33> @jaketapper Talking about someone losing their mind. He and his admin are truly clueless how they look to the sane world.
948543289233498113 2018-01-03 13:15:17 UTC <kdet33> @MSNBC He is a republican. Answers the question.
948492455531503616 2018-01-03 09:53:18 UTC <kdet33> @EdKrassen Everyone needs a dream. This whole thing is a nightmare.
948177892869115904 2018-01-02 13:03:20 UTC <kdet33> @GOP @SpeakerRyan - you people must be really scared to let this go on, or youre all traitors. Either way epic fail and karmas coming.https://twitter.com/natashabertrand/status/948174947511304192
948177206404100096 2018-01-02 13:00:36 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Scared arent you Donny. Theyre coming for you and your whole admin, family and traitors in congress. Someone who wasnt guilty wouldnt act this way. Karmas coming 2018.
947819414065434624 2018-01-01 13:18:52 UTC <kdet33> @GovHowardDean The sooner the better.

947638762313584640 2017-12-31 01:21:01 UTC <kdet33> @RepDeSantis -  why oh why would you put yourself in this position?  What do they have on you?  Cant wait to find out. Like many of your colleagues, I think youre toast.https://twitter.com/funder/status/947554010638311424
947597238989148160 2017-12-31 22:36:01 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @DuszaLukasz Much like your post.
947586454364020736 2017-12-31 21:53:10 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @Monica12650 @dager_mary @alanwhite1000 Mueller got it, just not fitting your timeline.   You dont get to make the rules, just wAit like the rest of us. But I imagine you wont be to happy when all is said and done.

941282941417803776 2017-12-14 12:25:16 UTC <kdet33> @armandodkos I listened to bernie for years on Tom Hartman, the man I heard on the radio is not the man who ran for president.  He is in reality closer to trump. Just like trump if u dont see things his way or support his beliefs he has no use for u.
941277458455777280 2017-12-14 12:03:28 UTC <kdet33> @GOP @SpeakerRyan - stop it now.  You are diving your own graves and being traitors to Americahttps://twitter.com/ali_h_soufan/status/941066294518042632

940903501126946818 2017-12-13 11:17:30 UTC <kdet33> @cwebbonline His tweet will come in the morning and hell attack Hillary or Obama for the defeat.

940630524875468800 2017-12-12 17:12:47 UTC <kdet33> @MSNBC why do you cover him at every turn. Way more important things than his signing something and continuing to lie to us.  We need to be focused on his corruption
940625008262606848 2017-12-12 16:50:52 UTC <kdet33> @SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump @RepCummings @NoMorePolitical You have a problem with reality?  If you defend him you have shown us your true colors.
940620743150374913 2017-12-12 16:33:55 UTC <kdet33> @HouseGOP Donald Trump just sexually harassed a sitting senator. He needs to be called out. You are now branded with that tweet. Say goodbye to 2018, karmas a bitch guys.

939943208917889024 2017-12-10 19:41:38 UTC <kdet33> @peterdaou @highwired2 @SovietBoyfriend @LeftwardSwing Hillary had the election stolen. Your attitude is why trump is president
939856789893451776 2017-12-10 13:58:15 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Are you frickin 6?  Tax bill bring special, god youre a real piece of work.
939856501564497920 2017-12-10 13:57:06 UTC <kdet33> @DonaldJTrumpJr Are you trying to get all these BS tweets out before your butt ends up in jail ?
939853558530404353 2017-12-10 13:45:24 UTC <kdet33> @TwinmomSue Such enlightened people on the other side. They deserve all thats coming their way when Donny and his band of criminals go down.
939852597137235968 2017-12-10 13:41:35 UTC <kdet33> @GovMikeHuckabee - we need a responsible and throughly good brand of representation from the WH. Your daughter cant tell the truth to save her life.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/939837511425314817

939844339164999681 2017-12-10 13:08:46 UTC <kdet33> @JoyAnnReid Like I have said, sometimes I think the only thing Dems are good at is eating their own. Wake up people, we are in a war and we are losing. Comments like that prove it.
939659921884409856 2017-12-09 00:55:58 UTC <kdet33> @AriFleischer Grasping at all kind of straws arent you ?

939122029877489664 2017-12-08 13:18:34 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump - you are a really stupid old man.  Everything comes back to bite you in the a*s.

939082185616871425 2017-12-08 10:40:15 UTC <kdet33> @BettieRose100 In over her head. She heard some inklings of her moving up in the party and believed them and got full of herself.
939081742933258240 2017-12-08 10:38:29 UTC <kdet33> @SenGillibrand - we deserve a full honest answer from you. If not, kiss your aspirations good bye.https://twitter.com/sarada_justice/status/938888529228177408

939043258243497984 2017-12-08 08:05:34 UTC <kdet33> @jpb2525 Im beginning to believe that Dems eating their own is the only thing were good at. Meanwhile the country is burning down around us.

939042187236458497 2017-12-08 08:01:18 UTC <kdet33> @seanhannity @TomiLahren Honey, do you think we give a crap?  Another uneducated little girl letting herself be used by the republicans.  In any other world I would tell you you are being sexual harassed, but you wouldnt care as long as you can hate in public.
939041641565798400 2017-12-07 07:59:08 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump You did this for one reason and one reason only, to appeal to your racist evangelical base. You dont care about Israel or anyone else. If hundreds get injured or die in violence its on your head.
938955271552098304 2017-12-07 02:15:56 UTC <kdet33> @brianstelter @antcypants Think about the fact that thecoman that Newt chested with is now the ambassador to the Vatican. Wow want a farce and a ticket straight to hell

938880950146162688 2017-12-07 21:20:36 UTC <kdet33> @SarahHuckabee -try again!  You support an abuser. God help youhttps://twitter.com/rvawonk/status/938843704667799552
938802184183001089 2017-12-07 16:07:37 UTC <kdet33> @HuffPostPol I listened to her comments, she did just suggest it.  She values power and money over decency. She said she would support others, I wouldnt trust her to support anyone.
938801721614176257 2017-12-07 16:05:47 UTC <kdet33> @DonaldJTrumpJr You ate a true disgusting person. Talking about a 2 year old and sexual harassment. Who thinks like that?  Oh yeah trump men.
938761439753498624 2017-12-07 13:25:43 UTC <kdet33> @matthewamiller Send Jared over there now and let him defend the actions to the protesters faces.  Hes a coward like trump. So what people get hurt o worse, people with no moral compass dont care.
938757042227044352 2017-12-07 13:08:14 UTC <kdet33> @TIME @ThreeAces_1 And all possible injuries and possible deaths be damned. Trump did this now for 1 reason and 1 reason only- to appease his base before Alabama vote. If you truly think he cares you are as delusional as him.
938755695108919297 2017-12-07 13:02:53 UTC <kdet33> @SenFeinstein Nope wrong on this one. Trump is burning down our country and democracy. He has been accused of worse things and Dems as usual our eating our own.
938749604006330371 2017-12-07 12:38:41 UTC <kdet33> @CNN @GingerLefty @irishrygirl @ChristinaEvangi 2 time removed Judge Moore. Wow thats really worth supporting, even before sexual abuse acusations.  Sad you people have no problem supporting a man who spits in the face of the constitution and wont take responsibility. Welcome to Alabama.
938748843100917760 2017-12-07 12:35:39 UTC <kdet33> @ChuckGrassley - how about it?https://twitter.com/juicypowers/status/938455162569441281
938720778144579584 2017-12-07 10:44:08 UTC <kdet33> @ChuckGrassley  - what a waste of time and money. Trump is guilty and no amount of covering his ass is going to work. The only thing your witch hunt may do is implicate you in cover up.https://twitter.com/astgeirsson/status/938455370913103872
938643556264300544 2017-12-06 05:37:17 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @debivoyles @EdanClay Get so tired of them eating their own. When we they learn they have to level the playing field, instead they tip it to the repubs.

938394399452606465 2017-12-06 13:07:14 UTC <kdet33> @Morning_Joe @girlsreallyrule @58isthenew40 Dont they hear the remotes clicking when they bring these liars on?  I hear the lead in and channel changes.  They arent doing any good ( except for themselves) giving voice to him. They havent learned their lesson yet
938390893865861120 2017-12-06 12:53:18 UTC <kdet33> @NewDay Stop stop putting her on. She lies as quickly and easily as she breathes. Dont uuu year the remotes clicking when she comes on. We all turn the channel.
938335131877638144 2017-12-06 09:11:43 UTC <kdet33> So stay in Alabama and recognize all you want.  Small issue of separation of church and state. Guess you havent read the constitution either, kind of like trump.
938333917291171840 2017-12-06 09:06:53 UTC <kdet33> You say that like Alabama values are a good thing!  Heres a hint, theyre not.

937263619196276737 2017-12-03 10:13:54 UTC <kdet33> @billyeichner @mshvan @immerspaetlin The majority of the 63 million that voted for trump were the working and middle class.

935461070432559104 2017-11-28 10:51:13 UTC <kdet33> @VABVOX @MAGAHenk Typical hit and run. Spew hate and lies and never defend your stance. You know why, because its all smoke and mirrors. Trump has done nothing except embarrass us and kill our standing in the world.
935458431292596225 2017-11-28 10:40:44 UTC <kdet33> @thedailybeast @SusanSarandon what are you going to do when Jill Stein gets caught up in the Russia scandal?  Cant wait to see you justifying voting for a traitor.  Lesser of 2 evils huh?
935457465570938880 2017-11-28 10:36:54 UTC <kdet33> @thedailybeast Why, why, why give her a voice?  She is dishonest and doubling down on her hateful  rhetoric because like trump she cant admit she is wrong. She needs to just go away.

935185041830932481 2017-11-27 16:34:23 UTC <kdet33> @gracedent Disgusting story.
935164909494652929 2017-11-27 15:14:23 UTC <kdet33> @EdKrassen Critical thought not a strong point for trump supporters.
935164637183709184 2017-11-27 15:13:18 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Well if your asking for a contest about fake news about our favorite president - then Fox would win, they lied about Obama constantly. You are no ones favorite or at least anyone who is sane.
935112499074162689 2017-11-27 11:46:07 UTC <kdet33> @kylegriffin1 @mcgboye @afelipe__ That and his inflated sense of self worth.
934935446894927874 2017-11-26 00:02:35 UTC <kdet33> @Bakari_Sellers Tweeted to him. He really has an terrible aversion to the truth.

934902411868753921 2017-11-26 21:51:19 UTC <kdet33> @SusanSarandon - god what a pathetic excuse. War has been declared on democracy and every person not of means. So just stay in your ivory tower and do us a favor - shut uphttps://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/934888940988923904
934901750561165313 2017-11-26 21:48:41 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Who do you think youll fooling, other than your low educated base. Russia, is not an excuse its the outcome of a cheater and traitor. Whole family going down and it will be glorious
934892889418674178 2017-11-26 21:13:28 UTC <kdet33> @VABVOX @greginthemiddle Who do you think voted for him then? Black males? Black females?  I mean you really dont have that many choices.
934819911771103232 2017-11-26 16:23:29 UTC <kdet33> @jaketapper @NateSilver538 Until you hold trump accountable and investigate him, the story really is very lopsided
934789247143481344 2017-11-26 14:21:38 UTC <kdet33> @UnfollowTrump Should we asked who dodged the draft. How dare you speak of soft on military.
934787600312922112 2017-11-26 14:15:06 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Hey Donny at least he didnt dodge the draft. Loser
934738484962701312 2017-11-26 10:59:56 UTC <kdet33> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You and Putin come up with this crap on your hour phone call?  Russia and media requiring to register as foreign agents. Wow the only thing transparent about you is your treasonous attachment to Russia.
934423702770417665 2017-11-25 14:09:06 UTC <kdet33> @sarahkendzior @liguy743 Excuse me, did you sleep through 2016.  Trump told abd showed us exactly what he intended to do.  But we know, everyone to business with But her emails

933513276218118144 2017-11-22 01:51:23 UTC <kdet33> @CNN @loganbennett129 Hes trashing this country and making $ at anything he can. Disgusting, its worth pointing out every illegal thing he is doing.
933512734825689088 2017-11-22 01:49:14 UTC <kdet33> @DonaldTrump - care to explain? Oh I know if they had been white, it would have made all the difference right?https://twitter.com/edkrassen/status/933507657729757184
933306673875312641 2017-11-22 12:10:25 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump You really dont have a grasp on how things work do you?  In fact you endorsed a child molester, Im not sure you have s gradp on reality at all. Scary for us

933298654881779717 2017-11-22 11:38:33 UTC <kdet33> @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GOP @AmandiOnAir @ScottPresler You understand you are telling the world you support sexual assault by defending trump and Moore.  Sad state of our country.  So nice try to move light away from trump and Moore and thanks for telling people exactly who you are
933297892499922945 2017-11-22 11:35:32 UTC <kdet33> @ElaineFox @kaitlancollins @gwallace48 Oh shut up with the fake news crap. It doesnt fit your view of reality so its fake right?  I guess supporting a child sexual predator gives you the ability judge others huh?
933297264797270018 2017-11-22 11:33:02 UTC <kdet33> @jaketapper @kaitlancollins @GuinnessDog @onenewsnowcom If we are to believe all these women who have accused Moore are liars, why cant we  believe Moore supporters wouldnt lie?  Such hypocrisy
933293904505405440 2017-11-22 11:19:41 UTC <kdet33> @Comey Trump like his supporters wont have a clue what that means. Thats the sad part.
933292916516065281 2017-11-22 11:15:45 UTC <kdet33> @lisamurkowski up to this point you were on the side of good not evil. Backing repeal of mandate has changed that.  You screwed Alaska and the rest of the country. Category of traitor now
933121858416906240 2017-11-21 23:56:02 UTC <kdet33> @TPM Please tell where us a bolt of lightning when we need it?

932941242685673472 2017-11-21 11:58:20 UTC <kdet33> @CNN First time Conway has spoken the truth since she worked for Cruz. Said trump was unfit then, wanted his taxes. Now its party over country and everyone else be damned. Wonder if shed let him watch her children?
932885031973990400 2017-11-21 08:14:58 UTC <kdet33> @USATODAY OMG stop it. Focus on the abuser in the WH.
932726022130282498 2017-11-20 21:43:07 UTC <kdet33> @NewDay Enough already with the trump voters. You're just giving voice to craziness and making the US look even worse. Try talking to people who are suffering under trump
932725178571853824 2017-11-20 21:39:46 UTC <kdet33> @alfranken @FoxNews @seanhannity @LeeannTweeden @Unpersuaded112 Another women allowing themselves to be used by republicans. Have you learned nothing, they'll kick you to the curb as soon as u are no longer useful.
932593663523409920 2017-11-20 12:57:10 UTC <kdet33> @ChrisCuomo @NewDay Where's the category from 75,000 to 200,000?  Why not complete info?
932590352443289600 2017-11-20 12:44:01 UTC <kdet33> @CharlesPPierce I couldn't believe she was saying that. We don't have trump because of Clinton. We have trump because of many reasons, including Joe and Mika
932576625522331648 2017-11-20 11:49:28 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Oh please god - shut him up. Lies lies lies lies and more lies. Getting nervous?  Mueller's coming for you and family
932576184721985537 2017-11-20 11:47:43 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @Realjmannarino Your worried about standing for a song while trump is destroying our country and is a traitor. But priorities right?
932574744788066305 2017-11-20 11:42:00 UTC <kdet33> @ananavarro @taffyfantasia Cup of tea for me.  Enjoying the peace & quiet before the day really gets going.
932547693397803008 2017-11-20 09:54:30 UTC <kdet33> @nytopinion @allhailcollins1 Quick question - why are you people so obsessed with Hillary? Do you spend as much time obsessing over the traitor in the WH?  If you're rooting for someone to go to jail, think donnys up first.
932415837671104512 2017-11-19 01:10:33 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle And as usual embarrassed us
932414823425384450 2017-11-19 01:06:31 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump My favorite president, I didn't hear him mention Obama once.  But thanks for giving us the opportunity to tell you, you are no where near any bodies favorite anything

932345641182924801 2017-11-19 20:31:37 UTC <kdet33> @BillOReilly Nope Sean is doing a damn good job all by himself of being irrelevant and being told to go home.  Really Bill you and trump don't know when to shut it up.
932339803902930945 2017-11-19 20:08:25 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Evil man you are.  That's all that can be said !
931920209664978944 2017-11-18 16:21:06 UTC <kdet33> @kylegriffin1 He and his whole group of traitors are cowards.
931895380060594176 2017-11-18 14:42:27 UTC <kdet33> @HillaryClinton @VABVOX They almost seem proud of their ignorance. Like it's s badge of honor.
931865023902863360 2017-11-18 12:41:49 UTC <kdet33> @lvdjgarcia The press is as bad as trump, they take no responsibility

931834184326369280 2017-11-18 10:39:16 UTC <kdet33> @NewYorker Um excuse me, Hillary knew and told us. As usual people were only listening to " but her emails". It's sad if investigating had been done in 2016, we wouldn't be in this fight for our lives.
931833574004838400 2017-11-18 10:36:51 UTC <kdet33> @VABVOX He's flaunting his lies right in front of everyone.  I'm getting tired of waiting for karma to show up.

931331750881611776 2017-11-16 01:22:47 UTC <kdet33> @EWErickson What a load of crap. Pence slinks around and under the guise of religion wants to take women back 100's of years.
931306651671564289 2017-11-16 23:43:03 UTC <kdet33> @IvankaTrump Hey Ivanka, if I thought you understood anything I would still say, it's crap for most Americans.

But that's ok, the truth will set all of us free when Mueller gets done.  And by the way victim blaming is disgusting, but I imagine u know that & don't care.

921320635661512705 2017-10-20 10:22:11 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump You are delusional. She was with the widow in a car and you were on a speaker phone.  God, you can't tell the truth.
921320228356796416 2017-10-20 10:20:34 UTC <kdet33> @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Life isn't about fucking ratings. If you want ratings go back to your crap reality show and get out of the WH.

921150934541045760 2017-10-19 23:07:51 UTC <kdet33> @hardball After saw your kelly tweet. Turned the station. You list me tonight
921149926884732928 2017-10-19 23:03:51 UTC <kdet33> @HardballChris No Chris he did not. How do you blame someone for hearing conversation as you were in room hearing conversation. Really?
921142548650954752 2017-10-19 22:34:32 UTC <kdet33> @ScottPresler Why can't she listen to conversation and he can?  Sounds a little hypocritical to me.
921119433342509056 2017-10-19 21:02:41 UTC <kdet33> @RonWyden I ask this honestly, does anyone in this admin tell the truth?
921111263379378177 2017-10-19 20:30:13 UTC <kdet33> @GottaLaff My thought when I heard that. Trump said he'd been calling. Why need help this time.

920964426186059776 2017-10-19 10:46:44 UTC <kdet33> @RepWilson @JoyAnnReid So much for the so called patriotism of the right. They scream at people kneeling & disparage a gold star widow, but trump is a hero. Sad

918466564604727296 2017-10-12 13:21:07 UTC <kdet33> @POTUS @AprilDRyan @PressSec Don't trust anything you say. You think trump is a good president.

918421952536154112 2017-10-12 10:23:51 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle So does this work for me too?  If stocks go up my debt goes down. Someone please tell the DOE that my student loans are less than showing.
918421254738243584 2017-10-12 10:21:05 UTC <kdet33> @foxandfriends @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Oh good, you're resigning?  That would make it a great day!

918384231579111424 2017-10-12 07:53:58 UTC <kdet33> @JoyAnnReid @isteintraum @Master_Chadley It's easier to disparage Hillary than admit to themselves what they've done to this country by electing trump.

918261144514650112 2017-10-11 23:44:51 UTC <kdet33> He must have gotten to the bottom of his talking points and gone back to top of list. Starting over again.
918253706495148032 2017-10-11 23:15:18 UTC <kdet33> @SophiaBush @KristinEliz23 @Npeacexxoo Oh please. Can you people ever deal with an issue without mentioning a Clinton?  Besides they aren't even in the same league.
918253141531021313 2017-10-11 23:13:03 UTC <kdet33> @SophiaBush @summerLsteele Such compassion for your fellow women.  Your president exploits women and has profited off of it.  Disgusting

918086167060508673 2017-10-11 12:09:34 UTC <kdet33> @nflcommish no kneeling rule. It is their 1st amendment right. Why appease a vulgar man like trump?
918077706788655104 2017-10-11 11:35:57 UTC <kdet33> @funder @dotjenna If I'm not mistaken at some point so did trump & he's a sexual predator also. Stupid right wing logic
918076179013341184 2017-10-11 11:29:52 UTC <kdet33> @RepDanDonovan sir you are a idiot. Keep supporting trump and you'll be remembered as a man who had no courage.

917888385636847616 2017-10-10 23:03:39 UTC <kdet33> @MichelleObama @BarackObama @Amy_Siskind Trump said it didn't surprise him, the news about Weinstein. That means he knew and to him it's no big deal. Birds of a feather.
917883001106763778 2017-10-10 22:42:15 UTC <kdet33> @DonaldJTrumpJr She's not the fucking president and there's pictures all over Internet of daddy and wives with him. Where's his condimanation?

915515575207636993 2017-10-04 09:54:57 UTC <kdet33> @TPM I have a better idea, let's purge pence and trump.
915508243572588545 2017-10-04 09:25:49 UTC <kdet33> @ChicoCat3 Burr says he's not running again. We have to make sure his replacement prefers the color blue.  Then work on getting Tillis out
915492555424518144 2017-10-04 08:23:28 UTC <kdet33> @seanhannity @thedailybeast Not pushing gun control is shameful. But shameful and Sean are in the same sentence way to often. You are complicit
915490369655144448 2017-10-04 08:14:47 UTC <kdet33> @SebGorka Wow, what a fool you are, and oh yes a traitor too!!!!

915337257569148928 2017-10-03 22:06:23 UTC <kdet33> @LOLGOP He doesn't care. Until last week he didn't even know they were American citizens.
915336839787098112 2017-10-03 22:04:43 UTC <kdet33> @POTUS @HallieJackson Of course all he cares about us optics. He thinks they're good. They suck just like him. He's frickin blind to real life.
915317551902679041 2017-10-03 20:48:04 UTC <kdet33> @GottaLaff To use his words - what a son of a b*tch!!!
915199366847135746 2017-10-03 12:58:27 UTC <kdet33> @mmpadellan If Stephen Miller is writing this crap for him, Duke University should ask for his diploma back
915198300281810944 2017-10-03 12:54:13 UTC <kdet33> @HowardKurtz You really may want to rethink this argument. Doesn't hold water, in fact it would be laughable if it wasn't so hateful & destructive
915197632733171713 2017-10-03 12:51:33 UTC <kdet33> @SpeakerRyan You're complicit.

915013411326631936 2017-10-02 00:39:32 UTC <kdet33> @thedailybeast @NathanHeard Don't think he said anything of the sort. But you maga's just keep pushing that crap
914995123276140544 2017-10-02 23:26:51 UTC <kdet33> @thedailybeast @cobreysr Lacks basic humanity
914885127787958272 2017-10-02 16:09:46 UTC <kdet33> @marcorubio Then why do you keep obstructing gun control?  Hypocrite
914877494242742272 2017-10-02 15:39:26 UTC <kdet33> @heoj Blah blah blah. Not terrorism if it's a white guy. Why don't u be honest instead of the crap you spew
914837669972193280 2017-10-02 13:01:12 UTC <kdet33> @rudepundit You have to have a conscience in order to do more. Not visible in the republican congress.
914836674718392321 2017-10-02 12:57:14 UTC <kdet33> @WRAL Excuse me if you didn't know about this one why should we believe you would know about any others?

914805690652348416 2017-10-02 10:54:07 UTC <kdet33> @RepAdamSchiff His boss unfortunately fails to understand anything and everything & the American people paying the price.
914797649043259392 2017-10-02 10:22:10 UTC <kdet33> @ChadPergram Maybe it's time for you to go. Such a load of crap. You people are inept and just don't care

914602033172373505 2017-10-01 21:24:51 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Already failing on every level.
914507469463937025 2017-10-01 15:09:06 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump Lying again. Such a good role model for your son and the rest of the children in America. Such a hack and a fraud
914474240899993606 2017-10-01 12:57:03 UTC <kdet33> @peterdaou @naimeiyao Don't forget, just not smart enough to see what they've done.
914404642892730368 2017-10-01 08:20:30 UTC <kdet33> @realDonaldTrump OUR soldiers & 1st responders are to busy to watch the FAKE news. You're the only one that has too much time on their hands. Not good Donny
914400177506734081 2017-10-01 08:02:45 UTC <kdet33> @PressSec @noonegrumpier @sgm_dan Guess you know the real answer now. Do you have a counter or just admit defending trump is a losing battle.
914394715184869376 2017-10-01 07:41:03 UTC <kdet33> @fema @POTUS @PressSec Sarah, Sarah, Sarah the bs is deep with you people. He's failing Americans and it's on display for the whole world to see.
914394151495626752 2017-10-01 07:38:48 UTC <kdet33> @fema @POTUS @PressSec @DaraDeBrun @olesage @Zander9899 You just insulted the clintons, of course because you can't defend trump, and u talk about liberals. What a piece of work.
914262299468165121 2017-09-30 22:54:53 UTC <kdet33> @UnfollowTrump Not your people. They are Americans doing their jobs, unlike you

913367086541492224 2017-09-28 11:37:37 UTC <kdet33> @Morning_Joe just listening to gov of PR. The man is lying.
913366100884238336 2017-09-28 11:33:42 UTC <kdet33> @thedailybeast 1st version of story. We know we will hear another and another from donny jr
913355871589224450 2017-09-28 10:53:03 UTC <kdet33> @thehill I assume this is version #1. How long before the next version comes out?
913348936785645568 2017-09-28 10:25:30 UTC <kdet33> @ChicoCat3 Stein was a vanity candidate, every 4 yrs she comes out of her hole. Obviously Russia threw money at her. We will know the truth soon
913346367564677120 2017-09-28 10:15:17 UTC <kdet33> @John_Prevette @GottaLaff @izzysroses If she lied why couldn't the republican brain trust in congress prove it. Old tired talking points. Sad
913344872677019648 2017-09-28 10:09:21 UTC <kdet33> No she's that stupid. Argued against the ACA then admitted she was still on daddy's health insurance.
