971818854560215041 2018-03-08 18:44:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @wsyx6 This is the 80s all over again.
971720047898095618 2018-03-08 12:11:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @seungminkim @anamariecox @HeidiHeitkamp @SRuhle @SenJoniErnst @hughhewitt We are having stormy weather here in Ohio.  Like 2 inches.  I'm sure you should cover that too.
971576774109876226 2018-03-07 02:42:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @903GaGa @SheriffClarke Keep crying you waste of breath snowflake.
971573378896355328 2018-03-07 02:28:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jorgeramosnews @seanhannity @McGovernJeffrey He has an intellectual audience?   Asking for a friend.
971573011169103872 2018-03-07 02:27:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jorgeramosnews @seanhannity How about coveting stormy and Donnie lawsuit.  Or....there is this special counsel thingy going on.
971500768514715648 2018-03-07 21:40:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper @dmartosko @EddiearBX @LadyConserv @Enoch_Root_ And if Cohen did this without trump knowing he has major bar issues
971453796600688640 2018-03-07 18:33:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SethAbramson But the @GOP faithful don't care.  They see trump as a god.  Look at the ones in Tx praising @tedcruz
971355065406689280 2018-03-07 12:01:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends Maybe because yesterday all major News organizations were covering actual news from nunberg and you were covering Clinton emails; doj abuse; and something that president Obama did not do according to the most corrupt trump.
971220670838427648 2018-03-06 03:07:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MSNBC @TheBeatWithAri @CheriJacobus Cant make this up!
971220432476045313 2018-03-06 03:06:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MSNBC Another lie by Donnie
971195057398304773 2018-03-06 01:25:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @wokeluisa I won't mind losing money to see this.
971188381693693953 2018-03-06 00:58:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @903GaGa @IsraelUSAforevr Thanks for the great laugh today.  I needed it.
971143460857270273 2018-03-06 22:00:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @tedlieu Because the @GOP doesn't care
971129799765880833 2018-03-06 21:06:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @2B_Painfree @RVAwonk Don't stop now pa.  You are doing great!!
971129065171292161 2018-03-06 21:03:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @thehill The @GOP doesn't care and won't do anything
971128544108654593 2018-03-06 21:01:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @thehill How is this not a national law!!?  The numbers are astronomical about domestic violence and how they escalate to more dangerous interactions
971128096115101700 2018-03-06 20:59:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DLoesch @shannonrwatts @cmclymer Call me a vanilla wafer too.  This usaf vet has faced much harder situations beyond name calling.
971127345137496065 2018-03-06 20:56:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @2B_Painfree @cj_disabledVet Of course.  The youth is making a movement and it's not good for @GOP
971092093065138176 2018-03-06 18:36:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JulianAssange @wikileaks @CNN @seanhannity Sean you are the last person to use the words fake news.  You are fake news
971019111332446209 2018-03-06 13:46:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump What about Russian sanctions?!?   Asking for our country.   I'm excited to see your tweet storm about yesterday's news
970986651383189504 2018-03-06 11:37:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends Cool news fox.  You know a kinda big thing happened yesterday.  But glad you are not covering it to save us from a familiar trump tweet storm
970985078003322880 2018-03-06 11:30:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DevinNunes Don't worry Americans, we have Nunes and @Jim_Jordan on this to distract from the @GOP shit show.  I'm guessing it was the Clinton; Obama; FBI; peanut butter; anything to distract from the Russia interests
970981049223319552 2018-03-06 11:14:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Thanks to @foxandfriends we won't get the unhinged trump tweets.  They are covering president Obama and the doj.   Can't make this up
970980657240342529 2018-03-06 11:13:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GriffJenkins @bethanyshondark @benshapiro @bradmeltzer @Sen_JoeManchin @JasonHanson_CCA @georgepbush @prageru @terry_superman @Judgenap @GerriWillisFBN @kayleighmcenany @JessicaTarlov @Mark_Penn @foxandfriends Will any cover the news from yesterday.
970980412221804545 2018-03-06 11:12:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @NewDay @brianstelter Ironically @foxandfriends is covering a story on President Obama and the doj.   Can not make this up.
970978750765654017 2018-03-06 11:05:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Did you happen to see or hear anything big that happened yesterday?!?   Come on @foxandfriends , something big happened yesterday.
970787777766920194 2018-03-05 22:26:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara What kind of @realDonaldTrump tweets should we expect soon?   Once he is off the golf course its on!
970695638773006336 2018-03-05 16:20:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AndrewGillum This will be the catalyst for change!
970694809437564928 2018-03-05 16:17:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DevinNunes @RealMAGASteve Wrong and proven wrong.  The warrant was renewed prior to the dossier and Nunes memo said such.  Facts my friend will set you free.  It was drunk papa talking about Russian who got it renewed.
970470727341264896 2018-03-04 01:27:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @dash_bandy @RealMuckmaker Hoping she's talking to Mueller!!   Get this ousted started
970468972285054976 2018-03-04 01:20:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @martin_kj @RealMuckmaker But @Gop and all the trumpeters say that gun sales are up and one treat of a person said they added 9m new members.  Funny how a @GOP can't do simple research.
970468040835043330 2018-03-04 01:16:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @dash_bandy @TheRickWilson Sadly his followers don't care and the @GOP enable him.
970389974901248000 2018-03-04 20:06:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @politicususa @Top_Sergeant @essenviews This is the worst of the worst with the @GOP.  @SenateMajLdr has some messed up agenda that's gutting Americans for the wealthy while representative of some of the pooerest.  Clearly has his agenda and not the ones he represents.
970389072442257409 2018-03-04 20:02:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kakabouie @wesley_jordan Nice work trump.  Bet the @GOP are going to blame everyone but @realDonaldTrump
970388618555641856 2018-03-04 20:00:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS Surprised that @FoxNews didn't spin this somehow and say it was Hilary's fault for saying tariff.
970371471431360512 2018-03-04 18:52:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Just another @realDonaldTrump lie.  Who cares is the new motto of @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr    Trumps Nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize Was Apparently Forged. Twice. - The New York Timeshttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/world/europe/nobel-peace-prize-trump-fake-nomination.html?referer=https://t.co/l8M7l7oIbP?amp=1#click=https://t.co/l8M7l7oIbP
970360376994025472 2018-03-04 18:08:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MuellerTimes @ChrisMurphyCT 200b in stock buybacks.  Yep....it's working you  @realDonaldTrump
970338768208257025 2018-03-04 16:42:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JohnKasich @hughhewitt Hugh, ever going to cover the crisis that trump is creating?   I thought since you live for the @GOP you would entertain trying to save it from your supreme leader
970336596368216065 2018-03-04 16:34:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends Best thing you ever talked about.  Nice job finally @FoxNews @TrueFactsStated is one who cares about our democracy
970335892555681792 2018-03-04 16:31:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @EdMarkey @tedlieu Too bad no one on the other side @GOP will stand up against this tyranny.   @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan are cowards and afraid of the big trump.
970294665097416712 2018-03-04 13:47:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kakabouie @Sparkle31888597 Keep it up TX
970294530678419456 2018-03-04 13:46:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews By selling our country?!?   Being the most corrupt person in the WH ever.  Family that sells influence to you.   How can you be so obtuse @MikeKellyPA ?   Please share how we are more secure and safe when a tad of research will say the world is less safe.
970292758232686594 2018-03-04 13:39:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews Funny you cover this as your supreme leader @realDonaldTrump is destroying the country, but let's fire up the right by talking about a Clinton.   You are the problem by not reporting actual NEWS.
970290871877894144 2018-03-04 13:32:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @Sinny777 @techreview The foolish sheep of the uneducated @gop followers who were too lazy or lacked the ability to do any fact checking.   You caused this and you need to step up.  It's you who will be hurt the most as this continues
970289277643952128 2018-03-04 13:26:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Sinny777 @FriendEden100 Imagine that.  A trump says something but doesn't realize the global affect since all they care about is trumps
970288912659861506 2018-03-04 13:24:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara President for life ~nope #TriggerTrumpIn4Words
970288697492074496 2018-03-04 13:23:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara Urine, why urine trump #TriggerTrumpIn4Words
970288588792434688 2018-03-04 13:23:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara We want the tapes #TriggerTrumpIn4Words
970288377500139522 2018-03-04 13:22:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara We can't tell who the dumbest trump is. #TriggerTrumpIn4Words
970288189360439296 2018-03-04 13:21:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MarkSimoneNY If you would stop drinking the trump cool aide and see what's going on, a sense of humor is paramount.
970065831479726080 2018-03-03 22:38:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @BanditRandom Just another lie.  No one cares on the @GOP about this.  False hope the @gop would get a spine.
970058033786179584 2018-03-03 22:07:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Rewire_News @ReneeYLaBonte It's crazy how the far right acts
970049119447379968 2018-03-03 21:31:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JElvisWeinstein How doesn't the @GOP step up for once.
970048822520016896 2018-03-03 21:30:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @bessbell But I won't have time to golf, "trust me".   What a dope and psychological liar.  But thw@GOP is cool with this.  Thanks
970015563039891456 2018-03-03 19:18:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Wait.  What about your failed tax bill we heard about every day.  200b in stock buy backs and 1.50 a paycheck.  Nice work
970012476019527680 2018-03-03 19:06:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @SenSchumer @RepPeteKing Keep a commitment?!?   Thanks for the laugh.  @realDonaldTrump is a liar the second his mouth opens.
970002190105497601 2018-03-03 18:25:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AP This is on the spineless @GOP for not teaming up for the USA and stop him.  As a vet I'm appalled with what he's doing @votevets
970000800134193156 2018-03-03 18:19:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNNPolitics @elegantcoretta Does anyone in the @GOP care to step up and question ANYONE OR ANYTHING in this admin?!?!?  You are all complicit now.
969575603774066688 2018-03-02 14:10:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @davidfrum But her emails and taking my guns is all I care about.  The trump supports are sheep who are getting fleeced and don't know it.
969559693214605312 2018-03-02 13:06:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump Didn't you use Chinese steel for your buildings?
969547329492733952 2018-03-02 12:17:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @IvankaTrump @ProudResister How is the dumb one known as Eric not?!?
969542508261924864 2018-03-02 11:58:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump No prayers to solve this?  Seems that's all you have on guns.
969407021920522240 2018-03-01 03:00:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @903GaGa @mitchellvii Totally stunning reading all your conspiracy theories.   I laugh at the ill informed
969402817642401792 2018-03-01 02:43:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @businessinsider This happened when you sold your soul to the devil.
969334784211243009 2018-03-01 22:13:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ericbradner Get out and vote!!
969306419358044160 2018-03-01 20:20:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Orangedrumpf Plus Hugh won't ever criticize trump.  Blame the news reporters but not the one creating the news?!?
969235999044833283 2018-03-01 15:40:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @StephenKing @Purrrnella59 @SteveGrieves More like a gut.
969206517584072707 2018-03-01 13:43:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RRN3 @NewYorker Are birds on the list trump keeps on people who insulted him and need retribution?
969034431943073792 2018-02-28 02:19:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kylegriffin1 Hopefully sessions is stepping up to trump.
968965596124733440 2018-02-28 21:46:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kylegriffin1 I'm sure all the @GOP will say this is nothing.
968840269989908482 2018-02-28 13:28:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SheriffClarke @Bmarks3502 Just messing around.
968823518682116096 2018-02-28 12:21:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SheriffClarke @Bmarks3502 You forgot airman here.   Great explanation and thanks for sharing it.
968664918902890496 2018-02-27 01:51:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Old news but still relevant.  This is trump being trump. Trump's attacks on Judge Curiel are still jarring to read - CNN Politicshttps://apple.news/AuXJiuv-uRnO5VK9kNLADnw
968660177988784128 2018-02-27 01:32:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @KFILE I'll answer for these two @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson "no, we know this is not true and it's fake, he didn't make any changes and if he did, President Obama did it.  I know this because it was in her emails"
968658882674511872 2018-02-27 01:27:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CollinRugg Do you actually believe this?   Please be a bot and not an American citizen.
968630577514602496 2018-02-27 23:35:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Amy_Siskind Thanks @realDonaldTrump for defending our democracy.  You are a disgrace.  I served to protect our country and you are self serving to destroy it.
968629026142277637 2018-02-27 23:28:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oufenix @RepTimRyan I wish more members of congress would call the @GOP out for all the lies and corruption.  Unfortunately trump creates a new distraction daily and then no one goes back to call him out.  It's his MO and getting clearer by the day.
968613823790895105 2018-02-27 22:28:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AdamSchiffCA I literally hope anyone who thinks we are better off with trump is a bot.  This is a guy who lies 5.6 times a day, won't sanction Russia; puts unqualified family in key roles, and overall is a poor excuse for an American.   Damn the wool has been pulled over some eyes
968489037970464770 2018-02-27 14:12:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DrDenaGrayson She has the questions and has for a month.  It's a meeting that will result in nothing.  But mueller already interviewed her!
968306517526147073 2018-02-26 02:07:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JWGOP @Acosta What.  Trump lies?!?   He will keep lying as long as he isn't held accountable for all the lies.
968306174146818048 2018-02-26 02:05:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @CREWcrew Ethics is non existent with the @GOP.  Trump lies, they fall in line.  Trump steals, they fall in line.  Trump cheats, that fall in line.   They don't hold trump accountable and thus they are not accountable.  Vote them all out
968305498339577856 2018-02-26 02:03:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @NRA @hansonbj2 As a vet I am  % against the NRA and certainly against any parade.  The last thing we want is to have to get another inspection prior to a ridiculous parade since you know trump wants to inspect "his military".
968292267512467457 2018-02-26 01:10:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Emma4Change Keep it going!   You are an inspiration to my 11 year old daughter who sees that standing up will make a change.   Make sure you add to your message to register to vote and get these dirty political ones out.
968269229978980352 2018-02-26 23:39:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @EdKrassen I would rather see her go in from of Mueller.  With @DevinNunes running this show he may ask her what kind of donuts does president like.  He's not going to have any real questions
968266671608778752 2018-02-26 23:28:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @dash_bandy @perlmutations A little less tweeting and more listening !!
968265239581077511 2018-02-26 23:23:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DanaRohrabacher @Top_Sergeant @HarleyRouda And get the word out about @BetoORourke in TX!   We will do our part here in ohio to get @Jim_Jordan out.  It's needed for the safety of our country to neuter trump
968261667879571458 2018-02-26 23:09:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jonfavs @Redistrict Please get Cruz out.   I don't know how he actually won.
968136176891777026 2018-02-26 14:50:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Bellatrixx2018 @Goss30Goss @Mazzakim The usaf appreciates you cleaning up after we blew everything up for you!   Yes we had the best food and golf courses!   Thanks for serving!
967858134307033090 2018-02-25 20:25:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews As a vet I can assure you that myself and my squadron would not want to do this.  Hell, we hated doing a simple FOD walk every morning and that was right outside our shop on the flight line.  @realDonaldTrump is doing this since he has small hands and hopes this helps
967857492406480897 2018-02-25 20:23:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RadioFreeTom Get our and vote.  @Emma4Change please make this a part of your message to get new congressional seats that will vote against these!!
967585970869690368 2018-02-24 02:24:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Jacob please know that he would be happy to share a cell with you once you both are in prison.  Maybe you can eat you some orange juice
967547847016177666 2018-02-24 23:52:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Janet4OH You better believe it @Jim_Jordan    You have embarrassed Ohio long enough.  Why are you saying this?   You are the problem with all your thoughts and theories
967546536761675776 2018-02-24 23:47:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @coffeespoonie Here is Bpic.twitter.com/WqlyA0uvmY
967183421318533122 2018-02-23 23:44:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GeraldoRivera @foxandfriends Keen on @realDonaldTrump campaign participants getting convicted again today?
967183070628601857 2018-02-23 23:43:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SRuhle I would like @Jim_Jordan to weigh in on this hoax with another convicted today!!!   Come on @Jim_Jordan your state wants you to answer this.
967158576845336577 2018-02-23 22:05:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DeniseS70824993 @benjaminwittes Hey @Jim_Jordan can we please hear you scream more this is all fake?!   Please, pretty please?!?!   We love to hear you speak in conspiracies and falsehoods
967145708825571328 2018-02-23 21:14:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> So @Jim_Jordan is it still a hoax this Russian thing?!?   We have not heard you screaming on tv in a while.
967135262370422785 2018-02-23 20:33:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @vicenews So now @realDonaldTrump is back to arming teachers?   Didn't you literally just say that you didn't say that and then attacked the free press again.  What is wrong with you?!?
967131333314142209 2018-02-23 20:17:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TheRickWilson This was recent so that just proves that Mueller knows the answers to the questions, are you telling him the truth.  This has to scare the daylights out of trump.
967128148482646022 2018-02-23 20:04:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump This didn't age well.  5 yes 5 of your campaign team has plead guilty!!   Too bad you can't just walk away and give up.   Wait.... you can and you know Pense will pardon you.  Do it for America so we can get back to being great.
967120272548605955 2018-02-23 19:33:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @tedlieu @lilithrising333 As an airman I can assure you that combat vets love the usaf.  Did you serve @KMCRadio ?   If you didn't, you clearly don't know the military etiquette on talking shit to one another, only military members can do that.
967081717331873793 2018-02-23 17:00:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @leahmcelrath @Lawrence @docrocktex26 @GOP @kylegriffin1 @SonofaMitchToo @Scanalysis This is accurate.  McConnell and ryan will sell their souls to pass bills for their donors, not their people.
966880333541986304 2018-02-22 03:40:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @toddstarnes Be beyond proud of my daughter.  I would know that I taught her to be strong and outstanding in her convictions.  So thanks for allowing me to respond.
966876047001059328 2018-02-22 03:23:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @mcspocky @techman4life_70 It's been nearly 20 years since I got out and you are totally right.  It stays with you forever.  Thanks my friend for serving.
966866937807540224 2018-02-22 02:46:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @kylegriffin1 @SonofaMitchToo Nepotism; corruption; careless with national security; selling secrets to get out of debt?   All questions that I would love answered
966860933460119553 2018-02-22 02:23:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AltHomelandSec As a vet who used one of these, the only purpose is to inflict the most casualties in the least amount of time.   To have one as a civilian is only not necessary, but no purpose but as sport.  A very dangerous sport too.
966859861509230592 2018-02-22 02:18:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WSJ @oufenix @coton_luver Must watch @TeaPainUSA @SethAbramson @PreetBharara @tedlieu.  How isn't @SpeakerRyan not getting more heat about this?   Doesn't he have an obligation to investigate?   When I served and if I heard this I wouldn't have dusted it under the rug like ryan did!
966857924063744000 2018-02-22 02:11:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kylegriffin1 Then why does the @GOP allow him access to classified information?!?   I had to go though a very intensive background just to get my clearance
966815733261926400 2018-02-22 23:23:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @maggieNYT @jimsciutto But a teacher would run to the shooter?!?  Arming teachers is just foolish @realDonaldTrump
966813155602116613 2018-02-22 23:13:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TeaPainUSA Clearly comprehensive is not a strength.  So disappointed in this person who is supposed to lead our country that I fought for.
966790095117455361 2018-02-22 21:41:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Reuters 3.2.1. @realDonaldTrump crazy tweets over this news.  Who will it be attacking?  Hillary; dems; president Obama?
966472889640906753 2018-02-21 00:41:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kylegriffin1 Hey @Jim_Jordan you may want to watch this before you tie your ridiculous concealed bill with background checks
966453832300597249 2018-02-21 23:25:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MissMyrtle2 There were armed men there.
965981721043841024 2018-02-20 16:09:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FBI @tedlieu How long till @realDonaldTrump starts his tantrum?
965434477047578625 2018-02-18 03:54:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @StephenKing Please make the most terrifying book ever around this president after this is done.  Would be interesting the twists you could put and scare the day lights out of us.
965425581553831943 2018-02-18 03:19:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CheriJacobus Always a tweet from @realDonaldTrump to contradict himself.
965423001155055617 2018-02-18 03:09:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @yelyahwilliams Make sure all the ones around you are registered to vote!   Take the topic and ownership at the same time!
965326211315650561 2018-02-18 20:44:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @amvetsupport I get the same when I bring up my military experience.  Funny how the trolls love going after the ones who will fight back.
965325649530454016 2018-02-18 20:42:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> True story about my 11 year old daughter who has school on Presidents' Day to make up from a snow day.  "I don't care to celebrate that day with thump as president, he's kind of an idiot".   @TeaPainUSA @SethAbramson @realDonaldTrump the youth are required to fix this mess.
965307567122583552 2018-02-18 19:30:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @_NotFakeNews_ Hey @PreetBharara @maddow @tedlieu @TeaPainUSA @RepAdamSchiff take a look at this.  Mueller has to know all this.  Now the cat will really ve out of the bag.  It will be ironic that twitter will be his downfall.
965281557484376069 2018-02-18 17:47:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @Purrrnella59 Don't cry, voice your opinion.  It's how we got our independence.   He won't take this country down, nov is very important to neuter him.   Cut his legs from under him, get blue in the house, start to impeach.   Remember most of the pro trump at Russian bots!!
965279974180704257 2018-02-18 17:40:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @Purrrnella59 I swore an oath to defend against foreign and domestic enemies, clearly that oath wasn't relieved when I separated.   Some of our core values are honestly and integrity, 2 traits clearly not exhibited by @realDonaldTrump
965279453134942208 2018-02-18 17:38:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SandyTheis We are on campus too!   Go lady bucks.
965278315685863424 2018-02-18 17:34:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Hey @GOP get your leader under control.  He is really hurting you with his off the cuff remarks on twitter.   Sincerely a vet who fought for our great country.
965220389503881216 2018-02-18 13:44:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @dash_bandy @TeaPainUSA And have a major twitter meltdown Sunday morning!!   It's getting crazy 
965209066397192192 2018-02-18 12:59:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump I'm curious how many of these pro trump comments are from the Russian bots.   I also hope all of them are or we have some real education to do on reading comprehension since they can't seem to read about facts.  Too much @FoxNews I guess.
964904924621484033 2018-02-17 16:50:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> .@RepMattGaetz what are your thoughts on the mueller indictments yesterday?   I see nothing from you.  Asking for a friend of a friend.
964617510023847942 2018-02-16 21:48:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @browardsheriff @FoxNews @DePl0rAbl3Me It said broward county, not FBI.   Guess you are on the train
964617283887869954 2018-02-16 21:47:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @browardsheriff @FoxNews @Kats_GA @StopTheDamLying Plus @FLGovScott wants to fire the head of the FBI.  Should he start talking to his own state about firing people there too?   My guess is that Scott only said FBI to get behind trump.
964616243562078208 2018-02-16 21:43:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> This is another 2014 tweet.  Hmmmmmm @realDonaldTrump looks like that timing is pretty consistent with the indictment
964614491244810240 2018-02-16 21:36:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AJ Always a tweet for everything @realDonaldTrump     Hmmmmmm... the timeline is starting to really align with the latest reports.
964501328973180929 2018-02-16 14:06:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @wsyx6 Just pulled to the side of the road with another motorist to honor them.  #WestervilleStrong
964500512967151616 2018-02-16 14:03:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MSNBC Please take note @GOP that this was a standalone bill sponsored by @ChuckGrassley.  Vote out the @GOP to make this county respectable and safe again.
964498928560431111 2018-02-16 13:57:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> I'm on the side of the highway to show my respect for the fallen Westerville police who were gunned down.  #WestervilleStrong 
964494402180796417 2018-02-16 13:39:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Julia_SCI Talked to my daughter about this and she said exactly this.  Run or throw things at the shooter.  We can do better.
963870483430158337 2018-02-14 20:20:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @971thefan for your conversations on now.https://costaide.com/falcon-cost/
962058154430230533 2018-02-09 20:18:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chrisbrown @rihanna This is our current president.  What a disgrace @realDonaldTrump    You  support all this abuse.
962056054409342976 2018-02-09 20:10:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MuellerTimes @Top_Sergeant This airman is with you and love how the bots attack the truth!!!
961962091488956417 2018-02-09 13:56:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Tell that to my face and family.   We lost our loved one from the enemy.   Guess disrespect to gold star families isn't just a @realDonaldTrump thing, it's yours too.  Stay class @FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC
961702561723056129 2018-02-08 20:45:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @dcexaminer @DonaldJTrumpJr Fake buddy.  Been disproved.
961679531236093952 2018-02-08 19:14:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CoachZachSmith @itsgabrielleu Wish you and your family all the best.   Glad he was going where he wanted and back to his home.
961664304742305792 2018-02-08 18:13:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @wojespn @itsjimmyw I'm sure lebron approves this along with Dwayne.
961658505575976965 2018-02-08 17:50:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @HillaryClinton @903GaGa @President1Trump Been disapproved.  Again you are looking in the wrong areas for corruption
961635622371971072 2018-02-08 16:19:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WSJopinion @LindseyGrahamSC Why are you defending trump?   It's more evident every day Russian interference hit our voting.  This is crazy and dangerous behavior from you
961586698143588353 2018-02-08 13:05:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TeamPelosi @epiphany504 Not sure if you ever served, but I didn't like the dog and pony show at all.  I would rather do my job and live my life.  Plus a lot of the members with families had a second job to make do.
961584906664054784 2018-02-08 12:58:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends @KellyannePolls @FoxNews What about the wife beater you had in the White House that kelly praised and said he shouldn't resign.
961274588876431360 2018-02-07 16:24:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @business Sorry but I'm not taking financial advice from @realDonaldTrump
961233090386563072 2018-02-07 13:40:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ananavarro Been screaming about having no clothes on.  But follow someone like @Jim_Jordan and you will see how his conspiracy theories are resonating with the right.
961207660904402944 2018-02-07 11:58:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper Usaf vet and think it's a total waste of money and resources.   I can't think of one good reason why @realDonaldTrump would want this but to get sone self satisfaction from this.

960642713778606080 2018-02-05 22:34:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @FarleyDouglas3 @TLHomeowners @noteabaggers Got to run with a sick kid.  I truly hope you are 19 and in Austin    Our country needs thinkers like you.  If you ever want to feel patriotic, head to Houston and look up sgt bury.
960641870396346368 2018-02-05 22:30:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @TLHomeowners @noteabaggers @FarleyDouglas3 Yes, small samples I'm working with.  But even a small sample with a majority view is something to consider.  It's polling and has a +- always
960641581027069953 2018-02-05 22:29:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @FarleyDouglas3 @TLHomeowners @noteabaggers Totally agree.  Your right.
960639895663497216 2018-02-05 22:22:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @FarleyDouglas3 @TLHomeowners @noteabaggers I totally agree it's your right.
960639407756926977 2018-02-05 22:20:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @TLHomeowners @noteabaggers @FarleyDouglas3 Never said hundreds or thousands.  You literally made that up.  I said I help ones getting out.  That's it.  My sample is small, but that's how they feel.  Please don't put words in my mouth
960638667869048838 2018-02-05 22:18:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @TLHomeowners @noteabaggers @FarleyDouglas3 Unfortunately they can't speak their mind until their service is up.  I volunteer and mentor out of service military, I have a good pulse on this.
960638253173964800 2018-02-05 22:16:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @FarleyDouglas3 @TLHomeowners @noteabaggers This is what's even better about our country, you and I can disagree and neither one of us has to fear the government.   Ps.  My cousin is decorated/ memorialized in Houston, buried in California.
960636740661805061 2018-02-05 22:10:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @TLHomeowners @noteabaggers @FarleyDouglas3 Despise ~ despite

A majority of the military despite our current leader but don't have the ability publicly to say so.  We took an oath to follow all legal orders, so far military wise he hasn't given illegal orders.  His daily lies are a different topic
960635963725811712 2018-02-05 22:07:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @FarleyDouglas3 @TLHomeowners @noteabaggers Taking a knee does not mean you are not patriotic.  Please understand this and actually listen Bailey, I fought, my cousin died, so you have your opinion.  It's what is great about our volunteer only service, we choose to put our life on the line for what we believe in.
960623643217850373 2018-02-05 21:18:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Hey @realDonaldTrump can I see a praise from you for the single largest stock market decline in one day?!
960622867787460609 2018-02-05 21:15:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @amysuds Best thing about American values is I fought for you to have that opinion.  I would have laid my life down for you to be a free and open thinker.
960622460851970050 2018-02-05 21:13:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @Marv_1911 Best thing about American values is you are entitled to your opinion.   Thanks for serving
960571009563873280 2018-02-05 17:49:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Ricka168 @nkleyva It's the ones who never served are the ones typically throwing a fit.  My family served and my cousin laid down his life for us, I promise you he would have more issues with an erratic president than someone taking a knee to protest racial injustice
960570156710879237 2018-02-05 17:45:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Magdalena0113 @wesley_jordan Stop trying to say @DonaldJTrumpJr is the densest trump, he has so many others he's running against.  Let's give it more time to see what trump is the dumbest before we award him the trophy 
960569522393632769 2018-02-05 17:43:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kinsman59 It's your opinion that the kneel is to punk the living.  That's what is great about our country, you have your opinion and I have mine.
960342873819541506 2018-02-04 02:42:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN As a veteran, I am offended when people don't take off their hat during the national anthem, not taking a knee.   I'm also a gold star family and know all about sacrifices.   Kap started something.  I don't always agree with him, but do his message.

960326923749675008 2018-02-04 01:39:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Bravo @verizon for that amazing public service announcement.  My girlfriend is a first responder and my daughter just thanked her!   Loved the message.
960298413752545280 2018-02-04 23:45:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> The @Toyota paraplegic Olympics commercial was amazing.  Had all of us touched.
960295336202964992 2018-02-04 23:33:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @Thee_BTK This was about the NFL players, not active military.  Hope you are not serious
960295030526218240 2018-02-04 23:32:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 @TLHomeowners It's people who never served or were close to those who have that get offended.  Bone spurs @realDonaldTrump shouldn't be preaching about service and respect.
960294497346293761 2018-02-04 23:30:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @komic111 It's not disrespectful to take a knee.  I did several times.  Yes.. people die.  Im a gold star family and know exactly what it's like to lose someone.
960293577803878401 2018-02-04 23:26:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @DonnaWR8 As a veteran, I am offended when people don't take off their hat during the national anthem, not taking a knee.   I've lost family in the war, they have the right to kneel

960243521805570049 2018-02-04 20:07:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @NormOrnstein @danpfeiffer He lost credibility when he said I was on @seanhannity last night.  No factual information comes out of that morons mouth.  But give him credit, he tapped into a profitable market of ignorant people
960242393395187715 2018-02-04 20:03:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @thebradfordfile @OldManPip It's hilarious and very sad how the ignorant will listen to anything @JacobAWohl says.  He's spreading false information and please do a tad bit of research to see this.  The Supreme Court Chief Justice appointed this judge to this, he's a @GOP too.

960133574597971968 2018-02-04 12:50:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan @LouDobbs It's embarrassing that you are using this dossier to cover for a Russian operative in Roger stone.  Nice work jimmy boy.   Ps.  Did you even read that memo?   I would try to explain how ludicrous your theories are but your Neanderthal will come out and you just tell more.
959504460857913346 2018-02-02 19:11:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @mattgaetz @FoxNews The warrants were because of trumps team and not the Steele dossier.  Please get the facts right and read your own party's memo you moron.  Go get a drink and go away
958409935573876737 2018-01-30 18:41:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends @Jim_Jordan and the truth don't go together.  He's better at spreading conspiracy theories
958409421729693696 2018-01-30 18:39:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @washingtonpost Biggest crock of .   The @gop are slim and trump is the supreme leader of this cult.
958356989939277824 2018-01-30 15:11:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @funder Follow the money!!   His ignorance and his base is what is the most puzzling though I have had in a long time.   They do not see he is not wearing any clothes
958356023831646209 2018-01-30 15:07:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RWPUSA The trump followers don't seem to care.  They have their guns; no health insurance; and will pay more in taxes.  Funny how the wolf in sheep clothes took them.
958354283778408448 2018-01-30 15:00:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SherrodFiles @SenSherrodBrown is someone who actually fights for the best interests of Ohio.  This is a hack ad and paid by the Koch brothers who try to buy tax cuts.
958353835147264000 2018-01-30 14:58:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> I'm a vet who served in a war; gold star family; and I think what trump is doing to our country is embarrassing.  He alone will destroy what I fought for.  We should lead the world; condemn Russia; and not lie 5.6 times a day.  Oh.  And not cheat on our 3rd wife.
958353755744989185 2018-01-30 14:58:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepSeanDuffy @FoxNews I'm a vet who served in a war; gold star family; and I think what trump is doing to our country is embarrassing.  He alone will destroy what I fought for.  We should lead the world; condemn Russia; and not lie 5.6 times a day.  Oh.  And not cheat on our 3rd wife.
957988361997873153 2018-01-29 14:46:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Wait, @SenateMajLdr lied?!?   No way
957987275018768385 2018-01-29 14:42:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends Funny, @DevinNunes donor paid for it.  More smoking mirrors
957352206684082176 2018-01-27 20:38:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @VanJones68 @donlemon @AC360 @wolfblitzer @Acosta @jaketapper @CNN @Chrisvega25 Ive been a vet against trump since he got on the national stage.  I'm supporting you  Chris!!
957258014960029698 2018-01-27 14:24:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kumailn So @seanhannity is lying about checking sources or his sources are lying.  Either way this hack is a known liar and anyone who supports him is a hack who is too lazy to research what he says.
956967663527489536 2018-01-26 19:10:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oufenix @mattdpearce You saved hundreds of potential victims.  Hope your community sees you as a hero and nothing less.
956939895033008129 2018-01-26 17:20:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Jim_Jordan @foxandfriends What does Russia have on you Jim?!?   Asking from all Ohio.
956875413074137089 2018-01-26 13:04:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SethAbramson @tokarsky23 Better game is do this while he is under oath
956875241841676288 2018-01-26 13:03:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SethAbramson Even moron @seanhannity is confirming this.   But @realDonaldTrump followers don't see a problem with thiy
956871913317511169 2018-01-26 12:50:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chicagotribune The only real @FoxNews reporter is Shep and he continues to call out the ignorant lies that @foxandfriends says.  @FoxNews is dangerous because our president watches then tweets immediately after what lies they tell.
956868652728553472 2018-01-26 12:37:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ainsleyearhardt He campaigned on Mexico paying for the wall.  Please @FoxNews @foxandfriends report the real news!   Your supreme leader @POTUS and his supreme followers should be told the truth.  Now we are paying 25b for an unnecessary wall.
956345012744327169 2018-01-24 01:56:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Phillies @Indians @Lucia_Flevares @MReiser4670 @Cicero_camus Seen it many times.  Big point is that it's not his decision.
956343352093564931 2018-01-24 01:49:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ChristopherHahn Funny how the @GOP are now calling for the release.  @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson are guilty of creating panic when it's in fact not necessary.  Plus it's been proven the Russians were pushing the release the memo narrative .
956342767478812672 2018-01-24 01:47:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Phillies @Indians @Lucia_Flevares @MReiser4670 I think it's Indiana too.  He has represented every city with class.   No bad choice, but would love to see him as an Indian.
956327226605219840 2018-01-24 00:45:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @_celia_marie_ My young daughter is an athlete and I have to give the young ladies and women who stood up to him all the credit.  I had that tough talk with her and I'm thankful for the ones that came forward.
956309943136784385 2018-01-24 23:37:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Indians @Lucia_Flevares Not his decision though.  I would love him to be Bronzed in Indian gear
956308309698637824 2018-01-24 23:30:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> So will he go in @Indians ?   I hope so.
956307676618743809 2018-01-24 23:28:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @11W @Flash_Ward12 We will miss him in Columbus, but always wish him the best.   Buckeyes nation proud as always!
956305453625085953 2018-01-24 23:19:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @votevets As a vet I served to avoid war, it wasn't weak to avoid conflict at any cost.  Today people want to start wars because we have been so easy on the world.   Starting wars to show strength isn't showing strength, it's actually showing you can't get along.
956227437469237248 2018-01-24 18:09:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper We as a country need to applaud everyone who stopped this.  The ladies who said something and the ones who believed them.
956226198585081857 2018-01-24 18:04:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY It's sad that I had to have a conversation with my 11 year old daughter who's an elite athlete about what to do if a doctor ever touched her that made her uncomfortable.  I'm thankful for all the ladies and girls that stood up and said something!
956209462452412416 2018-01-24 16:57:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu My money is on lying?   Maybe Vegas will have an over / under on the number of lies.
955773262528696321 2018-01-23 12:04:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LucasFoxNews @FoxNews This was my plane while I served and I spent time in the box with them.   Bad things are going to happen and I pray it's not because @realDonaldTrump wants a rating boost.
955632510679093249 2018-01-22 02:45:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> It's crazy how the @GOP trolls are out in full force today.  Wonder if the Russian bots are here or are the people of the US this stupid.  It helps that @FoxNews is pushing conspiracy theories and the trump followers are biting the bait hard!!
955587217812082693 2018-01-22 23:45:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> The Browns get Haley.  I like this!!!
955585943037251585 2018-01-22 23:40:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SykesCharlie @Kasparov63 But @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan want the Russians in our democracy.   Add @DevinNunes and most of the @GOP. It's embarrassing that @POTUS didn't enforce the Russian sanctions.   How quickly have we forgotten about that.
955437494228709376 2018-01-22 13:50:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Yes.   Mueller will be putting you in prison.  That's the truth we are waiting on.
955433629840273408 2018-01-22 13:35:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @SarahHuckabee @PressSec @hughhewitt Thanks Hugh for putting on people who supports a president who lies 5.6 times a day.  But who needs facts when you got your tax plan and you are a part of th @gop
955413476658302976 2018-01-22 12:14:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepMattGaetz Matt.  Your party won't release it.  You are spreading lies.  Go get a drink and think about telling the truth.
955412509590261761 2018-01-22 12:11:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @tribelaw Just more lies even if he got it right.  Guess the laws of giving birth are wrong.  Hey let's put @Jim_Jordan on this.  He alone can make a mockery of birth and change those laws with vigor and loud talking.
955411840384819205 2018-01-22 12:08:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @Wonderymore Oh yes they can and will.   Don't ever underestimate a @GOP fan and especially one of @Jim_Jordan
955411503393452033 2018-01-22 12:07:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews Total fake.  It was paid by a donor of @DevinNunes @Jim_Jordan lies constantly and is covering up something.  Please use facts and not conspiracy theories @Jim_Jordan
955409197163794437 2018-01-22 11:57:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TheRynheart That was funded by @DevinNunes campaign donor.
955407654234525696 2018-01-22 11:51:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianstelter @kaitlancollins Intelligence briefing is funny.   It's picture pages for adults.
955406763297263618 2018-01-22 11:48:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @franklingraham @FoxNews Honest!?   He lies on average 5.6 times a day.  Oh I picked a bad time to quit drinking.
955256394898444288 2018-01-21 01:50:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RobCalfee @thistallawkgirl I think he made the call to get that last touchdown.
955255686946058242 2018-01-21 01:47:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @RepMattGaetz @FoxNews @scuevas1023 I did.  You didn't read it I guess.
955255576627310593 2018-01-21 01:47:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @DeniseS70824993 @ehosseh Please don't use facts.  6 @gop voted no and still that blame the dems.  Can't even get their on house in order.
955255297538449408 2018-01-21 01:46:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @RepMattGaetz @FoxNews @scuevas1023 Ps.  Trump can declassify it any time.   Ps.  I know this because I can read and served this country.
955254940439601152 2018-01-21 01:45:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @RepMattGaetz @FoxNews @scuevas1023 I honestly am using facts and you are using emotions.

955252894655238144 2018-01-21 01:36:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @Sunrise51052 @903GaGa They are, but don't put this only on the dems when you can't get a consensus on your side.  How isn't this a bipartisan shutdown
955252497198800897 2018-01-21 01:35:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @RepMattGaetz @FoxNews @scuevas1023 Your party won't release it.  Sorry to use facts here.   Ps.  You are literally a pawn to the Russian bots.  Just do a little research on that too.

955251866291535872 2018-01-21 01:32:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @guypbenson 6 @gop voted no.  How's that the dems fault when you can't get your own party in line.  Hmmmm
955251238991552512 2018-01-21 01:30:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LukeM_PCwatch Hey.  Do just a bit of research.  Your party won't release it.  Sorry to bring up facts to a conspiracy theories
955250569039540224 2018-01-21 01:27:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @903GaGa @Sunrise51052 You are in control of all the branches and had 5 or 6 @gop vote against it.  Sorry facts don't concern you
955250041379278849 2018-01-21 01:25:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @4meJustice Your party won't.  Guess knowing what you tweet isn't a necessity with @JacobAWohl
955230243022868480 2018-01-21 00:06:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Jim_Jordan @foxandfriends @lil_lilly001 @diannejoslin2 Sorry, I'm a vet and gold star family member.  Born and raised in the us.  Love the rebuttal.
955227653337944065 2018-01-21 23:56:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Jim_Jordan @foxandfriends @lil_lilly001 @diannejoslin2 These "illegal " aliens pay into the system but don't get anything out.  You are the 10% who are against.  Do a little research about how this would hurt the economy!
955224061076037632 2018-01-21 23:42:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kylegriffin1 Don't bring facts when arguing with the @GOP.
955220740768501765 2018-01-21 23:29:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chucktodd @llstudent08 @davidaxelrod This administration takes no accountability at all.   Bunch of right wing conspiracy theorist @Jim_Jordan is the leader.
955220452309430272 2018-01-21 23:27:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @carrieksada Your own party will release it.  You really have to not fall for the Russian bots.   Don't believe me, do yourself a favor and spend 1 minute researching.  Or are you a bot
955219938867859457 2018-01-21 23:25:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Jim_Jordan @trumps_feed @foxandfriends @thunshad1 We have to get him out!!!
955219762270949377 2018-01-21 23:25:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends And @Jim_Jordan puts Russia in front of the USA.
955216628232400897 2018-01-21 23:12:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @espngolic Total respect for this organization.  Now come on cleveland!!
955215978102689793 2018-01-21 23:10:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DevinNunes @TheRickyDavila Why are the Russian bots and @Jim_Jordan @DonaldJTrumpJr pushing so hard.  It seems like the @GOP is more interested in theories than facts.   Plus they didn't realize that the memo was so one sided.  Can't wait to see #MuellerInvestigation to push faster
955214891849277441 2018-01-21 23:05:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Im curious @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan @DonaldJTrumpJr why the Russian bots are all over release the memo hashtag?   Asking for a friend since your own @DevinNunes won't release it to the @FBI @TeaPainUSA
955212230156529664 2018-01-21 22:55:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CheriJacobus This is the "memo" that @DonaldJTrumpJr is trying to fire up his base.  It would be extremely embarrassing to Nunes but I would love to see them release it and then let's discuss all the Russian bots that @Jim_Jordan and his lackeys promote.
955211509575159808 2018-01-21 22:52:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LukeSmi80066520 @kylegriffin1 As a vet and gold star family, I'm all behind thus statement.  #CadetBoneSpurs
955210165250330624 2018-01-21 22:47:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DevinNunes @TeaPainUSA Hey @GOP and all the @realDonaldTrump followers, could this be true and @DonaldJTrumpJr is trying to fake you all out.  Guess what, the emperor isn't wearing any clothes.
955176394354544641 2018-01-21 20:32:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RobCalfee @kylegriffin1 Could it be that @StephenMilIer is a racist?
955176178352115712 2018-01-21 20:32:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @aliasvaughn @MSNBC Do you see @StephenMilIer your racist views are not mainstream.
955173387952943105 2018-01-21 20:20:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @crampell Nothing like more unquestioned and unqualified in trumps tenure.  #TrumpsShutdown

955099430994284544 2018-01-21 15:27:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @imtutwo1 @aliasvaughn When will @realDonaldTrump say that Jared is nobody and was just around to fetch Big Macs and diet cokes
955076834126979073 2018-01-21 13:57:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @Franklin_Graham @FoxNews @GasperiCaroline @kcashoz Did I ever say what Clinton did was acceptable?   Change the narrative all you want.  Clinton isn't president and was nearly impeached about lying about it.  Ps.  It wast with a porn star and there wasn't a new born baby in the picture.  But your trump is all character
955072209931862016 2018-01-21 13:38:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino Don the con.
955072055896100864 2018-01-21 13:38:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @Franklin_Graham @FoxNews By having sex with porn stars while married ?  I didn't learn that in the Bible.   Some Christian please point me in the right direction
954872679328251910 2018-01-20 00:26:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PissedOffGinja @samswey Hey at @GOP you are propagating Russian information and passing as you's.
954345169528213504 2018-01-19 13:29:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @aliasvaughn @washingtonpost Another winner @realDonaldTrump    So much winning it's hard to keep up.  I literally can't wait till more indictments come out.
954340283822481413 2018-01-19 13:10:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Sinny777 @kylegriffin1 Something like this needs evidence.   The @GOP will do or say anything
954338813978976256 2018-01-19 13:04:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends @KellyannePolls @FoxNews Just keep her on fox.  She's good for them since she lives in an alternative reality.
954147754913292288 2018-01-18 00:25:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @imtutwo1 @kylegriffin1 So now the puppet master is trying to control the independent investigation
954000166679449600 2018-01-18 14:38:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Something big is happening here in Columbus.   Houses / apartments are going up at a frantic pace.  we have one of their data centers & distribution center.   I don't know what is going on, but some serious activity here.  This isn't a tweet to start a hate war against Ohio 
953999248374288385 2018-01-18 14:35:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oufenix @JoyAnnReid What an insult to our democracy.
953971744355815424 2018-01-18 12:46:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNNPolitics @jaketapper Where is the disconnect @realDonaldTrump from you and Kelly?
953830213665910785 2018-01-17 03:23:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Hey @Jim_Jordan , the @GOP controls both sides of congress and the president. How can you blame the dems?  Also, you will be voted out.
952585205155590144 2018-01-14 16:56:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TerryMcAuliffe @jaketapper @CNN It's a grown up job @hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump    Act like it!!

952583334021955584 2018-01-14 16:48:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JustBeaTee @Liberallogic5 @KyleMak Yep.  Im a snowflake.  Thanks for serving too.
952582868076843008 2018-01-14 16:47:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @sendavidperdue @FoxNews @Kivrin01090708 Trump isn't working and he's living on Obama.
952563890956664832 2018-01-14 15:31:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @sendavidperdue @FoxNews End chain migration works for me.  Let's get rid of @FLOTUS and her family.   Right ... ?!?!
952563469513093120 2018-01-14 15:30:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews And @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan @senrobportman are in deep shit from the shithole they created and you cover this!    Glad he's safe and ok
952562454546051077 2018-01-14 15:26:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews And the current @realDonaldTrump has been implicated to the Russians.   Great news organization here.  Let's see where this goes with or without the Clinton name.
952510948299984896 2018-01-14 12:01:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DearAuntCrabby But he's not going to take my guns.  .  Here are facts trumpster: Your guns aren't going away with a dem ; your insurance will go up  with trump ; you don't benefit from the market; and not being racist is ok with the rest if us.
952340802423984129 2018-01-13 00:45:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TGowdySC @thewoman62 @Kate4Djt @903GaGa It's ok.   I served honorably and had generational family sacrifices for our country
952339087901515776 2018-01-13 00:38:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TGowdySC @thewoman62 @Kate4Djt @903GaGa I love your answer.  My family was killed by the nazis for helping the Jewish people escape.  I'm on your side and that was meant as a retort to Kate.   I'm proud of my German, Irish, and English background.   #ImpeachTrumpNow
952338118711136256 2018-01-13 00:34:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> I'm a vet and gold star family.  Who cares if @realDonaldTrump is a racist!   My guns are here and the market is up!!!   I CARE!!! The @GOP is complicit in this behavior and they need stopped.   @votevets to get the #BlueWaveIsComing #MuellerInvestigation
952337056075837440 2018-01-13 00:30:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LouiseMensch @RosePointLane @AlderWode Hey.... as an adderall user I'm offended!!  I don't sweat profusely
952332857908912128 2018-01-13 00:13:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WhiteHouse @FoxNews That's a lie!!!   Why lie about things you don't need too.  Come on!!
952332426918981632 2018-01-13 00:11:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GoodforFlorida Follow the Alabama blueprint Florida.  Grassroots efforts and hard work.  Us in ohio will do the same.
952330933327290370 2018-01-13 00:06:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brookefoxnews @FoxNews Oh.  That denied it.  I totally believe it.
952330298737549317 2018-01-13 00:03:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brookefoxnews Since @FoxNews said it, it's true.  Look up the most dishonest media and @FoxNews is at top.  I hope all @realDonaldTrump followers see as soon as you can just how played you were.
952329110461788162 2018-01-13 23:58:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> But... he's pro guns and not Obama.  So... it's ok with the alt right
952325980080754688 2018-01-13 23:46:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoyAnnReid They were too easy on him.  I wish @senrobportman would hold a town hall!!!
952325421735071745 2018-01-13 23:44:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TRICARE @llstudent08 @ColMorrisDavis I'm a vet but don't need the assistance, but I know many do.  They won't realize how bad they have it till later this year.  @realDonaldTrump doesn't care about the poor, he's cares about his money.  Not the rich people, HIS MONEY
952324882792054785 2018-01-13 23:42:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TRICARE @realDonaldTrump @llstudent08 @ColMorrisDavis But he didn't take their guns!!!!
952324482764505088 2018-01-13 23:40:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RealJamesWoods Probably a better opportunity since you are dead to Hollywood with your alt right nazi views.
952323975425732608 2018-01-13 23:38:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PatriotByGod Guess since he's not a neo nazi like you he's not a republican?   Before you insult me, I would love to know how you really feel about American people.  I served and a proud alum to stand against your kind
952323139429683200 2018-01-13 23:35:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TGowdySC @thewoman62 @903GaGa @Kate4Djt I'll play your game.  What's a real American look like?   Considering you are not  % Native American, im guessing you are an immigrant. So it's ok for your ancestors to arrive without prejudice, but anyone new should be?!?
952318470640865281 2018-01-13 23:16:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LouiseMensch Literally everything you have said in the past that was dismissed has come to be true!!   Please keep helping the people of America who see @realDonaldTrump for what he is!!!
952314191733575680 2018-01-13 22:59:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TeaPainUSA I guess the @realDonaldTrump followers could actually see that this was a tragedy but not Hillarys fault.  But fools like @Jim_Jordan @hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump @ScottAdamsSays @FoxNews kept up with that narrative along with @GOP
952307394415034368 2018-01-13 22:32:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @llstudent08 @cnni Wondering?!?!   He's done more damage for the next 10 generations
952307176588144640 2018-01-13 22:31:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @BillClinton While the right believes what they want without facts, one thing that did stick out was how @hughhewitt jumped on this story without proper resources.  So can we say that Hugh isn't a journalist but a commentator?
952301483231449090 2018-01-13 22:09:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oufenix @DavidJollyFL Let's blame everyone @realDonaldTrump     Fact... you are destroying your party and have followers like @Jim_Jordan @DevinNunes @SpeakerRyan backing you up.   Midterm elections this November!!!
952297552724062208 2018-01-13 21:53:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @pixnvids @SaysHummingbird His base @realDonaldTrump doesn't care.
952295954581000192 2018-01-13 21:47:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends Glad you are covering @realDonaldTrump and his ignorance.
952290431081033730 2018-01-13 21:25:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @MaddowBlog @Amy_Siskind @OuttaJoint Struggled for 20 minutes with a phone!!!   The fact they thought they could get away with a clearly bogus report is funnier.  His base would be ok, the rest of us question this as to why?!?
952290000502185990 2018-01-13 21:23:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @imtutwo1 @Goss30Goss We fight for one another and would lay our life down for the person next to us.  This mentality allows us to protect our country.   Don't think this vet appreciates anything from @realDonaldTrump.  I want to know if we were sold to the Russians @Jim_Jordan
952277682905141248 2018-01-13 20:34:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TGowdySC With that said, thanks for stepping down from the ethics committee.  Now onto the next topic, why you still covering for the Russians.
952276748355371008 2018-01-13 20:30:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @aliasvaughn @AdamParkhomenko Guess having no ethics like @Jim_Jordan will catch up to you.  Nice work trey getting out before it's too hot.
952272052676853760 2018-01-13 20:12:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump I'm waiting for you to say you invented the question mark
952270713628610560 2018-01-13 20:06:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @imtutwo1 @AynRandPaulRyan What most don't realize is that a large number of social services are in fact military members!!
952268072043376643 2018-01-13 19:56:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kylegriffin1 Imagine if the people actually organized and had a clear agenda on what they wanted answered.  Also not let him dodge the questions so easily.
952230375337725952 2018-01-13 17:26:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @mcspocky So let's blame the reporters, not the vile @realDonaldTrump for saying it.  Nice work @FoxNews for blaming the media.
952225421772443649 2018-01-13 17:06:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Bucknuts247 What a great voice.  He will be missed!
952215020800299008 2018-01-13 16:25:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @lsfarmer311 @SteveSchmidtSES Get out and vote.   Follow the Alabama blueprint on how to defeat the racist right.
951918734268076032 2018-01-12 20:48:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RobCalfee @MEPFuller Sounds like a @realDonaldTrump tweet.   Not @SpeakerRyan.  Still a hollow response and deflection.
951882931080974336 2018-01-12 18:25:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Kivrin01090708 @adamcbest Well spoken.  I wish just one trump follower would allow themselves to just listen to what his words / tweets are doing to our country.
951879326982721536 2018-01-12 18:11:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @lsfarmer311 But his base still loves him.   What a train wreck of a president @realDonaldTrump
951878817899057152 2018-01-12 18:09:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump As always, you reply with something off topic.  They said you said it was a shithole, not take them out.   It's like talking to a 4 year old with you   Next time just say you are sorry.
951830881366364160 2018-01-12 14:59:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SykesCharlie They don't care since he speaks their language.
951813093545345025 2018-01-12 13:48:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @lilscud1974 @shannonrwatts But the tax plan
951811178078048256 2018-01-12 13:40:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Trump @realDonaldTrump @DJBurn77 @TeriFreeman @trumpa256 Hmmm.  I think we did find out he's a racist.  Guess what he says and writes should not be used to prove his ignorance and racism?   Oh.   Please do go to emails, fake news, Russian isn't real, and whatever the right goes to when confronted with facts. Ps. God bless you too
951810256769830912 2018-01-12 13:37:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends Can they look for a brain?   Too bad emptiness can't be tested for
951806895286902784 2018-01-12 13:23:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @pixnvids @PalmerReport And he emails @seanhannity and how can we suppress voters and punish blue states
951806508559413248 2018-01-12 13:22:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @HuffPost Maybe he doesn't know what racism means.   Like he's so smart that racism isn't in his vocabulary
951805326721986560 2018-01-12 13:17:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @pixnvids @joshgad Let's ask @foxandfriends @hughhewitt @seanhannity why they accept this?!?   I would love to see any @GOP stand up to @realDonaldTrump and his ignorance
951804155894620160 2018-01-12 13:12:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @mkraju Got the tax plan.   Who wants morally and sound reps if they get what they want.
951803819440136193 2018-01-12 13:11:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GroverNorquist @foxandfriends Hey.  Can't wait till @realDonaldTrump tweets about dinner.
951801956154204162 2018-01-12 13:04:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @billyeichner @JenniferCooney9 But his base will love this talk.  Literally said from the White House.   He speaks his bases language.   Wtf!!!
951801443715026944 2018-01-12 13:02:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @billyeichner But the tax plan.   Oh and his racist base loves him.   @seanhannity @hughhewitt
951800119577468928 2018-01-12 12:56:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump These are incorrect arguments.   How dumb are you?  Shit.... I guess this topic was just on @foxandfriends
951799509763461120 2018-01-12 12:54:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonnaWR8 Thanks for quoting @seanhannity.   This made my day and weekend.  It's also extremely depressing that anyone would use his platform in public considering he is not a journalist.   But.... it's your rose colored world trumpsters
951798036128296961 2018-01-12 12:48:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RobCalfee @ddale8 Oh the irony.   Please @CNN @USATODAY @maddow ask him some tough questions.   Please don't be like @hughhewitt @foxandfriends
951797637644279808 2018-01-12 12:46:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN But on @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt it's how Obama setup off shore drilling; his fake birth certificate; emails; the great economic burst; cheetos are the best; nothing to look at with Russia; and the trump ratings are over the top!
951796821734645761 2018-01-12 12:43:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CortesSteve @FoxNews Totally BS and why still defend him.   I don't talk that way and my friends don't.   I'll always disagree with racist and ignorance.
951795541163282434 2018-01-12 12:38:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @donlemon @CNN @tj_lsudad Money and the @foxandfriends @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP @hughhewitt will keep him as long as he will sign what's in front of him.   Just listen to his meetings. 2018 mid terms get out and vote
951795030456455171 2018-01-12 12:36:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @donlemon @CNN @safranovitz This is hilarious!    He's about 150 lbs bigger; doesn't care about anything but money, and should be out of office with his severe mental illness
951794580177018880 2018-01-12 12:34:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @donlemon @RobCalfee @CNN Yes.  Get out and vote!!
951794442889060352 2018-01-12 12:34:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY Hey @GOP @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt is this the tax plan working? But the buy backs are really helping the economy.   But I got mine is the theory.
951793333915004928 2018-01-12 12:29:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump Guess you watched @FoxNews @foxandfriends today. Did you miss all the sams clubs getting shut down.   Hey @hughhewitt what's your thoughts here
951792969392287745 2018-01-12 12:28:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @RobCalfee Please please please don't use facts. They are irresponsible and ignorant in any case discussing trump to his followers.
951626146847887360 2018-01-11 01:25:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JamesOKeefeIII @Lordozz Trump = smart.    Nope!!!!  Trump = moron and @DonaldJTrumpJr is at the top.  #MuellerIsComing
951625042336669699 2018-01-11 01:21:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Dangchick1 It's the anchor  baby.
951623692483776512 2018-01-11 01:15:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Professing_Prof But his ratings are so good with @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @hughhewitt @TuckerCarlson     But....lest not forget that he's still a moron.   The economy is good, but we all still want him out.
951622553788997633 2018-01-11 01:11:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @MarkSteynOnline @TuckerCarlson Tucker is not a journalist, he's a propaganda machine.  Please see the difference.  If you want to debate please use common sense and not feeling.  But.... you are wrong.  Tucker is feeding the trump
951612214322049024 2018-01-11 00:30:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @ChelseaClinton @TuckerCarlson @ProtectivPopPop @kbreesehr The girl is the best.  She does want to look at northwestern.   Like you, I love this country and want the best.    Keep in touch and congrats on getting the boys off the payroll and onto grandkids
951608712652902401 2018-01-11 00:16:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @ChelseaClinton @TuckerCarlson @ProtectivPopPop @kbreesehr You earned a follow.  My daughter is my life.  Have a great day.
951604841532489728 2018-01-11 00:00:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @ChelseaClinton @TuckerCarlson @ProtectivPopPop @kbreesehr Let's see.  I disagree but respect your opinion
951602990074466304 2018-01-11 23:53:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @ChelseaClinton @TuckerCarlson @ProtectivPopPop @kbreesehr I will say that trump is getting rid of regulations that save the earth and governance, but he's allowing the corporations to make more money.  But... I'm against destroying the earth for profits.
951598287374704640 2018-01-11 23:34:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @kbreesehr https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/28/trump-message-obama-economy-260858
951596934774579202 2018-01-11 23:29:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @ChelseaClinton @TuckerCarlson @ProtectivPopPop So mr kevin @kbreesehr is in HR and retweets this!?!   Would love to hear how you work with your coworkers when they don't look or think like you.  Clearly you are an adult.
951596114192601088 2018-01-11 23:26:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @kbreesehr You  win for most patriotic text ever  !!!   I recognize he won, never said he didn't.  The economy is great but remember it was on an upswing with Obama.  Please please please bring facts when replying.
951589256832737282 2018-01-11 22:58:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PhilipRucker @kaitlancollins His base... not real versed on how this country was founded.
951584792897818630 2018-01-11 22:41:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepAdamSchiff Hey @realDonaldTrump you really are a joke.  But you have your followers; @FoxNews @hughhewitt behind and under you.
951581986036043777 2018-01-11 22:29:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @mcspocky @healthpolicymav How about we do a shot for every lie!   How long till we are plowed
951581751247335425 2018-01-11 22:29:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @mcspocky Ha.  Thanks for the laugh.  What would the Vegas over / under on the number of confirmed lies he told.
951579301845008384 2018-01-11 22:19:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kakabouie @joshuamanning23 Our ignorant leader @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt
951578886680338433 2018-01-11 22:17:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @businessinsider Such a great man.  Oh wait, that works only when @realDonaldTrump says it about himself.  What a disgusting human.
951578034963996673 2018-01-11 22:14:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepSinema @kyrstensinema @kakabouie @BryanDawsonUSA Only the @GOP !!   Hey Hugh, this is your party you support blindly @hughhewitt
951577584504131585 2018-01-11 22:12:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DavidSchawel Nice tax bill @hughhewitt
951576709945577472 2018-01-11 22:09:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper In all seriousness, after these ignorant comments from him something big typically follows!!   What is it?!?!
951576502847631360 2018-01-11 22:08:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper Can he embarrass us anymore?   Hey... totally rhetorical question...  answer is clearly a yes.
951573982452572160 2018-01-11 21:58:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @pixnvids @StephenKing How's trumpeters going to defend this without sounding racist and ignorant.
951540458504835072 2018-01-11 19:44:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepGoodlatte @RepRooney @TGowdySC @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenBobCorker @SenatorBurr @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @lsfarmer311 @old_osc And Jared did a large deal with them right after he won.  Hmmmm
951451424063401989 2018-01-11 13:51:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SykesCharlie @axios Citing anything from @FoxNews isn't news, its opinion.  Well... except for trump voters.  It's their gospel
951295581539962880 2018-01-10 03:31:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MuellerTimes @ProudResister I would love for him to look into this.  The rest of his pathetic life would be on the wrong side of the judicial system
951295578486566912 2018-01-10 03:31:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump It was your tweets used against you for the ruling.   Man are you really this unaware of what you say and more importantly do you not know anything about civics and the separation of power in our democracy?   Serious question
951295572027346944 2018-01-10 03:31:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @VP @Amy_Siskind This is just sad for those families.  Also it's sad how bad the working class was played by the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump
951206720528842753 2018-01-10 21:38:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @22aspen36 @scottwongDC He got his money with that tax break.  Now to go off into the sunset.
951205976060973057 2018-01-10 21:35:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY There is no way he does this.  He has nothing to gain.  I would love nothing more than see him self incriminate.   But all he would do is plead the 5th.  Mueller needs to have his case without any corporation from @realDonaldTrump
951188662724767744 2018-01-10 20:27:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CheriJacobus He talked about telling the truth.  This is hilarious considering nearly everything he says is a lie.   How can the people take @realDonaldTrump seriously around libel.
951187476151971847 2018-01-10 20:22:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RobCalfee @RobertMaguire_ What's he hiding now?
951187000303980544 2018-01-10 20:20:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Jim_Jordan @techmaster58 I could not disagree anymore with your statement.  I respect your opinion, just don't agree.  I want to know why he's desperate to shut down the Russian investigation.
951111733040558081 2018-01-10 15:21:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Jim_Jordan Can't wait to vote you out.   Also why do you cover for trump and Russia so much?   Asking for a friend.
951111521408618498 2018-01-10 15:20:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ASYF2020 Blame president Obama too please.   Her emails.
951111192143155201 2018-01-10 15:19:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @randy_sheets As you defend Trump.  Please see the irony since he talked and discusses ratings.
951108195912704000 2018-01-10 15:07:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @NormEisen @RNA2021 Did you see his handler stop him and say that she wants DACA without security?   The @GOP is tying DACA with security.  He was clueless
951106471953076224 2018-01-10 15:00:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews Your organization is the problem with our country.  You continually praise @realDonaldTrump when all he did was obstruct the process.  Threatening war and poking the bear isn't deserving any credit.  Give credit to South Korea, they were the ones in imminent danger
951102702053986304 2018-01-10 14:45:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ericgarland @20committee @chrizap @LouiseMensch @counterchekist @911CORLEBRA777 Who wouldn't love to see him get deposed under oath.  Could only be better if / when trump was up there or Donnie JR.
951100963481415680 2018-01-10 14:38:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SenFeinstein @JeffFlake @AZVotes This was a man who literally didn't know what was going on.  This is like doing a speech in school without knowing the topics.
951097651235315713 2018-01-10 14:25:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump Best part of this is that they used YOUR tweets in their filing because you were in favor of this at one time.    Stop tweeting and then let's see what happens.   Oh well... you will forget what you tweeted a few minutes after
951095989548482561 2018-01-10 14:18:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost There is always a trump tweet to counterattack trump
951079286156464128 2018-01-10 13:12:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GlennKesslerWP @PhilipRucker Too bad that @foxandfriends viewers don't think he lies.  He speaks the gospel according to Trumpsters
951079029662273536 2018-01-10 13:11:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kylegriffin1 This is a mess of a presidency.
951078714972008448 2018-01-10 13:10:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TheWorldsFrates @princesslucymoo The news is real except @foxandfriends    If you choose to not research what they say or read other news, that's a you problem.
951076064557785089 2018-01-10 12:59:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @sendavidperdue @FoxNews Why can't you solve DACA without an unnecessary wall!   Illegal immigration has gone done significantly over the past couple decades.   This really should not be a partisan issue.
951075339886845952 2018-01-10 12:56:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNNPolitics @jaketapper I really want to see what they are really hiding?
950957356665450497 2018-01-09 05:07:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Reuters A true leader trying to make the world better
950956756821336064 2018-01-09 05:05:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ananavarro @kakabouie @CNN That's leadership in its worst way.  He takes no ownership or accountability.
950956464566423552 2018-01-09 05:04:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @22aspen36 Keep fighting @SenSherrodBrown    We believe that you care more about the people of Ohio than the corporations.
950956216636837888 2018-01-09 05:03:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ir2pol @konkamusa @TobyDonastorg @kc8ysl @BigHPrivateEye As a vet he has earned that right to peacefully protest.  On top of it, I agree with him.  It's not like he turned his back , that would be a different story.
950955491529838593 2018-01-09 05:00:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DanaRohrabacher @GOPLeader @Retired_Now I'm curious if there are any legal repercussions for @SpeakerRyan for not addressing the issues.  @PreetBharara can you offer any insight or @SethAbramson
950945056835407872 2018-01-09 04:19:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TDPattillo @sue_wahoo I watched him in that meeting.  Amazing is not the right word I would use.  His handlers had to tell him his own position.
950879946297266177 2018-01-09 00:00:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AndrewCMcCarthy @brithume @MTGoldblum I know this hurts, but the republicans paid for it.  It was a donor to nunez.https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2017/12/28/1728250/-NEW-Devin-Nunes-Campaign-Donor-Was-Original-Funder-Of-Trump-Russia-Dossier
950846302778265600 2018-01-09 21:46:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @Elithewhack @TLO555 Thanks for serving first of all.  I am from a gold star family that lost our beloved Marine.
950845650169663489 2018-01-09 21:44:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @Elithewhack That they do.
950840864397516806 2018-01-09 21:25:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Judgenap @foxandfriends What about @ChuckGrassley and @LindseyGrahamSC ?   I am curious about Huma as well.
950839412308529153 2018-01-09 21:19:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @Elithewhack Don't cross him?   This is not the Mafia, it's the United States.  People are allowed to speak their mind.  This is not a dictatorship where you can be "cursed" for doing so.
950838635208863744 2018-01-09 21:16:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CoryBooker Just keep protecting Mueller please.
950821992336363522 2018-01-09 20:10:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ChuckGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC @espiers Don't forget that @SpeakerRyan was having a conversation with another congressman and they brought up that trump was on the Russian payroll.
950821436498825216 2018-01-09 20:07:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> After reading the fusion report, Quick question @PreetBharara , if @SpeakerRyan heard from a colleague that thought @realDonaldTrump was taking money from the Russians and did nothing, has he committed a crime?   Looking the other way to get what you want seems criminal
950812249010196480 2018-01-09 19:31:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @allytheis When asked if you have any regrets the answer is always no.  When asked why, you say I love where I am at and wouldn't be here if any one thing changed.  Love  kid.
950761028018692096 2018-01-09 16:07:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Purrrnella59 This has to be a joke.  Please... I'm waiting for a bazinga
950760584596938752 2018-01-09 16:06:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MikeGibbonsOH I agree but don't agree with you.  Having another lackey trump follower is exactly what we don't need.  Plus we have an Ohio fighter already there!
950732798578561025 2018-01-09 14:15:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY @senrobportman Wow.  A tweet not about the tax bill.  Kudos!!   On a serious note, get this opioids epidemic under control.  It's not a race or sex issue.  Talk to your people in Ohio, we want to help, you just won't or don't want to listen.
950732309145292800 2018-01-09 14:13:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @aliasvaughn @MSNBC Looks like the rats are jumping ship.  I wouldn't mind a @GOP replacement if they served the United States and not trump.  They are supposed to represent their people, not Russia and @realDonaldTrump.  If they refuse to disavow the toxic GOP then no way.
950711565115908097 2018-01-09 12:51:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfriends How much longer till an unhinged @realDonaldTrump tweet comes out.
950711035245268993 2018-01-09 12:49:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @KCStar @kakabouie @JamilSmith While this is appalling, he did offer an apology.  Something that seems to never happen from others in the @gop.   Hopefully he sees the drug crisis is just that, a crisis.  It doesn't have a race or sex where I am from.
950705592515153920 2018-01-09 12:27:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @dannykanell What about osu / Miami and the 4th and 14 krenzel to Jenkins for 17 to keep the game going.
950696733759213573 2018-01-09 11:52:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SethAbramson This is terrifying because @foxandfriends will say this and then ten minutes later @realDonaldTrump will blow up twitter with something drastic to cause a deflection.   Hold on, going to be a bumpy ride.  Clearly fox cares more about ratings than facts and security
950557443083395073 2018-01-08 02:38:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CBJFrontLine Nice win jackets.
950556168979697665 2018-01-08 02:33:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JRubinBlogger Oprah would actually bring in the smartest people to work with her.  She has always surrounded herself with the best.  She doesn't require picture books and constant adulation from the ones around her.  I would choose her over @realDonaldTrump anytime.
950546702435536901 2018-01-08 01:56:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DeniseS70824993 @TrueFactsStated He's in rural Ohio.  This needs to be about what he's doing to them.  Personally I would focus on the tax cuts then a line about the FBI / Russian coverup.
950533114908078081 2018-01-08 01:02:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kaitlancollins @SteveSchmidtSES Two things here: No denial on what was said I served and am from a gold star family  I know sacrifice and trump has never been one to sacrifice.   To the @realDonaldTrump supporters who say he gave up his money to serve, he's profiting off the presidency
950516231722995713 2018-01-08 23:55:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl @jaman495 I'm sure he washes trumps balls.
950511203117301762 2018-01-08 23:35:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Jacob is the total waste that trump loves.  Total criminal that clearly doesn't have any reading comprehension.
950431628744151041 2018-01-08 18:18:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper @bigdaddy42011 I literally don't know where to start.  But exactly why did you say this?   What did he say or do?   Were you upset that he didn't allow Miller ample time to talk about nothing
950417943891972096 2018-01-08 17:24:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Of all the negative things said about the fire and fury book, no one really disputed anything.  Bannon backed down; Miller ignored it and said Bannon was crazy; trump went with hoax and fake news.  #MuellerTime #fireandfurybook #RussianCollusion
950360047355342849 2018-01-08 13:34:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tennesseine And something negative about president Obama and sec of state Hillary.   Oh and emails.
950074974269779968 2018-01-07 18:41:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WSJ Doesn't deny anything.  Keep that in mind.
950059596135182336 2018-01-07 17:40:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara @kylegriffin1 @kareketas @nebhusker84 Beyond corrupt.  But democracy will win.
950029830329954305 2018-01-07 15:42:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kylegriffin1 I absolutely love @PreetBharara and his common sense approach.  He's always level headed.  Keep up the great work as a true American who cares about our democracy
950020361709670400 2018-01-07 15:04:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TrueFactsStated Better question is how many times have you been pulled over with a suspicion of dui.
950013890364133376 2018-01-07 14:38:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ddknyt @hughhewitt Totally love the denial hugh.  The @GOP is imploding; your #stablegenuis president is unraveling; and you won't address it.
949856851537154049 2018-01-06 04:14:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN I hope that they boo him till the point he gives that stupid lost look on his face.
949700385354211328 2018-01-06 17:53:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Good job changing the focus from tax reform.   Getting rid of weed is not the answer to the opioid Chrissy
949665755523624961 2018-01-06 15:35:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoyAnnReid Serious question: Maybe he brings up Hillary and the past because it's all he knows because he really is suffering from a mental health issue.  Or he's just a self serving maniac who has no abilities other than bullying
949665080928559106 2018-01-06 15:32:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @robreiner Favorite parts of his tweet are; Hillary again; business man; tv star;  not one mention he's the president of the United States.   Where is that mind in his own universe?   He has a lack of learning new things.
949493270605914118 2018-01-05 04:10:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LindseyGrahamSC You are so correct and honorable back then.   Now you are complicit to this mess and doing nothing.
949492350761472000 2018-01-05 04:06:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TrueFactsStated @Jim_Jordan @DevinNunes are at the top of my list simply for their destructive behavior and insistence on interfering and smoke screening the mueller investigation
949488431301832704 2018-01-05 03:50:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Yes!!!!!! You brought up tax reform again.  Literally 6x today.  Nice work.  Ps.  You still have a mentally challenged person in D.C. You should focus on.  And opioids; vets; anything but touting a passed bill.
949449550535839744 2018-01-05 01:16:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @GOP @washingtonpost @hughhewitt So disconnected hugh.  The president is insane and yet you still support him.  Maybe they are having an intervention with him to tell him he's crazy
949442112730394625 2018-01-05 00:46:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SpeakerRyan What changed?   You got your tax break for your donors so now step up and get him out!!!  When I served I took an oath and swore to put service before self.  Clearly you and @Jim_Jordan @DevinNunes @senrobportman @LindseyGrahamSC didn't.  Let's get them out @funder @EdKrassen
949407589170864134 2018-01-05 22:29:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @Jim_Jordan @oufenix @martin_kj Ohio will do its part.  Just need grass roots to remove him.  He's is a very rural area
949407285989793792 2018-01-05 22:28:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SherrodBrown @JoshMandelOhio @MikeGibbonsOH @wsyx6 @BenWSYX6 Oh I'm laughing at you , like literally laughing.  Good luck with your campaign with the shit show in D.C. That the @GOP are letting go on.  Can't wait to see what you run on.  Is Bannon or trump going to support you?
949406767586467840 2018-01-05 22:26:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @Jim_Jordan @oufenix @martin_kj He does for sure.  Can't sit still and is irritated and irrational.  Plus has the worst manners by always talking over others and raising his voice to try and bully you.  He must go
949405636567191552 2018-01-05 22:21:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oufenix @martin_kj Not sure of coke head, but @Jim_Jordan doesn't believe in facts and continues to spread lies.  Alabama gave Ohio the blueprint to defeat these @GOP and it's our job to get him out.
949399434667921409 2018-01-05 21:57:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt You care about the census as the @GOP is trading agenda over the safety of the USA?  You got your extra money hugh, now tell the world that trump is unfit and a danger to the safety of the us.  Plus you have that little story on Russia and obstruction.
949396529688739841 2018-01-05 21:45:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @KatyTurNBC @atrupar It seems that every time @Jim_Jordan sounds like an idiot another @GOP will lose a seat.  Keep talking jim, we in Ohio are looking forward to replacing you and the defunct theories you push.  Go @Janet4OH and win this.
949394353641881600 2018-01-05 21:37:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Yea rob, more tax tweets.
949392702310899712 2018-01-05 21:30:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @KarenLeitner1 It's @Janet4OH.  Let's get her voice heard and shut down the blow hard @Jim_Jordan
949368650003337216 2018-01-05 19:54:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @joingles @NoSkellingtons @JaredBorg It was developing since it was developing and would rather say developing than just throw it out there.  This is real journalism and not fake.
949356025483857921 2018-01-05 19:04:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Dude.  Seriously talk about something else.  The tax plan passed.  It's done.  Move on to the next area of focus unless you are out of ideas how to make yourself more money.  Ps.  Trump is loose in D.C with a twitter account
949338040413155329 2018-01-05 17:53:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Again on tax reform.  Worry about @realDonaldTrump please.  Hey senator, the tax reform passed.  Please move on and find something else to discuss.
949326887100272641 2018-01-05 17:09:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LindseyGrahamSC You are worried about the olympics when you have @realDonaldTrump is running this country into the ground.
949289117476671488 2018-01-05 14:38:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Fake news to its core.  @FoxNews @ShepNewsTeam already debunked this several times.
949288901419716608 2018-01-05 14:38:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Funny how you talk about jail and money laundering.   It really is considering that you will be in the same position.   Remember this free advice "better to be quiet and have people think you are a fool than to open your mouth (tweets) and prove them right.
949284463250419713 2018-01-05 14:20:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @lsfarmer311 @MikeLevinCA Don't tell @DonaldJTrumpJr , he "loves it".
949282956035743744 2018-01-05 14:14:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Let's make a deal @AndrewCMcCarthy @hughhewitt , let Russian investigation go without interference from @DevinNunes @Jim_Jordan and do your Clinton investigation.  Let them do their investigation and see where they end!   This sounds like "look, we did this but you did that"
949277069355175937 2018-01-05 13:51:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr I have a feeling you will be indicted soon.  Care to out up a wager?    Didn't think so.
949131254858829825 2018-01-04 04:11:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> The thing @RichLowry is that it says he had to research how to write the EO, not the contents of it.  Plus the best part is that @DonaldJTrumpJr retweeted your total lack of reading comprehension.   This is winning at its best
949124904615600128 2018-01-04 03:46:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman @MarshallLaw82 Totally agree.  Portman likes to throw up smoke screens as you hoses our country for a dollar.
949124474582036481 2018-01-04 03:44:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @kmindeye Sounds like your supreme leaders organization @realDonaldTrump    Funny you are worried about the Clintons as your supreme leader is screwing you and destroying the earth.
949051209796726785 2018-01-04 22:53:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman As a vet and gold star family I appreciate this, but it should be lower on your priorities.   Opioids ; homeless vets; cannibis; healthcare; offshore drilling; Medicare and Medicaid; and that crazy in the whitehouse.   Hey.....thanks for not toting your tax bill today
948979338292154368 2018-01-04 18:08:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Let's make a deal @Jim_Jordan @DevinNunes , leave the #MuellerTime investigation go; go back through the whole Hillary emails as much as you want.  Don't impede either investigation and let's see what is what.  Deal?!?  Keep marijuana to the states; focus on the madman in DC
948957193239449600 2018-01-04 16:40:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Getting rid of weed isn't a step in the right direction.
948952147797954560 2018-01-04 16:19:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @glennbeck It's funny how anyone can defend Bannon and / or trump and coming from beck just makes it funnier. I wish nothing but get them all out of D.C.
948674491428884481 2018-01-03 21:56:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Hey it passed.  Now work on that crazy in the White House before we start a war.
948674354241470464 2018-01-03 21:56:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @KarenLeitner1 I'm going to do some digging.  I know that @Jim_Jordan has a very poor reputation here in Ohio.  Unfortunately he's in a very rural area and they don't see how much he is screwing them.
948589291734749184 2018-01-03 16:18:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Jim_Jordan We in Ohio are going to ensure your treasonous self will be removed.  You embarrass our state and values.
948388165479534592 2018-01-02 02:58:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN @tedlieu We need to start the process of getting him out.  He's going to lead us to a nuclear war.  Find a way to get the @GOP to put country before party.
948375430075179009 2018-01-02 02:08:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman How about stopping this lunatic in D.C. @realDonaldTrump
947890223937196037 2018-01-01 18:00:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @tedlieu Why can't this be brought up in congress?!   Also let's start the impeachment process
947676767229300736 2017-12-31 03:52:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @gehrig38 @oliverdarcy @r1chh007 @Taughtology Best ever follow up!!!   Absolutely loved it and laughed while reading.  Goose walk .  You got a new follow
947501855294226433 2017-12-31 16:17:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oliverdarcy @r1chh007 Oh @gehrig38 is so right winged fascist that had this been Germany he would have enlisted in the ss and would have proudly duck walked around
947479331797905408 2017-12-31 14:47:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper @oliverdarcy Need we finally agree that @gehrig38 is as tasteless as @seanhannity
947141176729141248 2017-12-30 16:23:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @samstein I would not expect @foxandfriends @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump to ever live up to their past tweets.  They only care to build up trump and put down any accomplishments the @BarackObama ever did.  2018 is the year we wake up and take this country back @votevets
946974796780376064 2017-12-29 05:22:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @jessphoenix2018 @BulgerShawn 2018 is a year to take back our country!
946394669596008448 2017-12-28 14:57:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @seanhannity @aliasvaughn @Purrrnella59 Please don't ever try to use facts; common sense; decency; or basic human behavior when talking to the alt right.   They don't understand anything but intolerance; ignorance; and self serving behavior.   We need to focus on the middles to win congress in 2018
946394065284816896 2017-12-28 14:55:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @politico It's a Thursday and another lie from @realDonaldTrump.  What's new with this narative, nothing since all he does is lie.   Wake up please and realize he's a self serving arrogant and dangerous person.  #ImpeachTrumpNow #MuellerInvestigation #MuellerTime
946310364140113920 2017-12-28 09:22:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @calif6native @r1chh007 @Purrrnella59 @allenemies4n This is a total country effort to make this happen, but necessary to minimize the damage @realDonaldTrump is creating.  It's our civic duty as Americans to push back when we see issues.  He never ends up being accountable for his actions!!
946181609388150784 2017-12-27 00:50:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @BillKristol It's the winning trump effect.  He's toxic and needs to go.
946100114657087489 2017-12-27 19:26:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @votevets @yeahokisee Get the word out.  Let's get this to 5m soon.  Then let's start the ground swell to remove the @GOP that bows to trump with decent candidates that can minimize his destruction
946096944534904833 2017-12-27 19:14:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Sign up to get the movement on its way!   @votevets #MuellerTime #MuellerInvestigation   Trump is a dangerous president, we #NeedToImpeach him now! Join me by signing the petition:https://www.needtoimpeach.com/?sc=tws
946094091846041601 2017-12-27 19:03:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @carolineonpoint It's disgusting that we got to this point.   We're going to take this back.
946082066323705856 2017-12-27 18:15:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @NormOrnstein @tribelaw @JanzforCongress You got all the help I can give.  @votevets this is one we need in congress and we have to get traitor Nunes out!!!    Take back the country in 2018 #takebackorcountry #MuellerInvestigation #MuellerTime
946064961842896897 2017-12-27 17:07:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @johntmarohn Plus he doesn't know what's it in.  Not enough pictures to explain to him so they gave him bullets: Your taxes go down - you cut federal assistance to your base - you weaken veteran benefits - the @GOP will kiss your ass.   Done was his response
946063993063518208 2017-12-27 17:03:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @OfficialJonZal Well said my friend.  He's an idiot without a mission with keys to the biggest earth destroying weapons.  We all need to join forces in 2018 to minimize his destruction and make congress a branch to check him.  Flip those reds to blues!
946062039654502400 2017-12-27 16:55:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @dmartosko You do realize your supreme leader has wasted over 90m on trips to his property and has continued to embarrass our country.  You my friend are worried about the wrong things.
946019953014132736 2017-12-27 14:08:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @JoshMandelOhio Don't talk about my hometown.    Bet a vote today wouldn't end the same way.   They realized you and trump don't care about them.
946019685669195776 2017-12-27 14:07:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SherrodBrown @JoshMandelOhio Fake and fake.   Following the @realDonaldTrump model is going to kill your campaign.   Keep it up!   @votevets this is a candidate right out of the trump playbook and needs to be defeated.
946019313789566976 2017-12-27 14:05:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoshMandelOhio Im betting you don't.  The @realDonaldTrump bravado is not what we want in Ohio.  @SherrodBrown is fighting for Ohio and against the vile @GOP that you are attached too.   Lies and more lies wont work anymore.   You and trump = 
946018653929172992 2017-12-27 14:03:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SherrodBrown @JoshMandelOhio You are a lying @realDonaldTrump follower.  You say what you think people want to hear.  I thank you for your service but besides that you are garbage and fueled by Bannon.   Be happy you have a job in Ohio.
946016582790205440 2017-12-27 13:55:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @MoltonGeorge Ohio can do it's part.  We have to ensure the Koch brothers and Bannon don't taint the population.  Ensure @Jim_Jordan is not voted in and turn Ohio blue again.  Let's follow alabama and do what's best for the USA
946014726617788416 2017-12-27 13:47:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @jimsciutto @AC360 @ARA136 @JazminBlue It starts with getting rid of @SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump They are not trusted by the other side.   The key to this going in the right direction is a candidate who is center with a running mate that's the same.   Work with congress as a team.
945892836502921222 2017-12-26 05:43:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TeaPainUSA Come on Florida, follow Alabama on how to remove the @GOP     Don't forget @marcorubio and his loyalty to @realDonaldTrump     Take the usa back in 2018
945888074839527424 2017-12-26 05:24:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chrislhayes We need to connect with his base.  How can they see that the fight is for the USA and not against Hillary and president Obama?   The fight is for the USA and what we stand for.   #MuellerTime
945884974259064833 2017-12-26 05:12:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jmclaughlinSAIS @realDonaldTrump has lost everything but his base.  I want to help them with facts that he doesn't care about them.   Bringing up Hillary and President Obama only fires their fuel and creates the diversion of him taking everything from them.  2018 is the year of real patriotism
945882850758455297 2017-12-26 05:03:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Kivrin01090708 I would have used the military code of justice every time @realDonaldTrump gave me any order.  "I will always defend the US against all foreign and  domestic enemies.  Donald and the @GOP are the enemy.
945870259847909376 2017-12-26 04:13:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AllenCMarshall So let's not worry anymore about what they will do in the next 11 months.  It's now time to rally this country to take it back.  We care about the smoke country and not the super rich.   Get out and find the @GOP rep and ensure everyone knows what they stand for.
945848420161421318 2017-12-26 02:46:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @StephenKing We will need your influence to help with us taking this country back.  2018 is when the real Americans step up and fight for decency and a real president.   Look out for our help
945847432205697024 2017-12-26 02:42:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @2B_Painfree @AJMic7 @ReSister2016 It starts with one voice and goes to the masses.   We all can work as one to defeat this @GOP.  2018 will have the most patriotic activists since I've been alive.  We're a team to minimize the damage @realDonaldTrump has already done.
945841694452396034 2017-12-26 02:20:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoyAnnReid This is why @votevets and all the vets needs to get out and explain we aren't fighting you.  We are fighting for our country.  The rural Americans are not forgotten and are not going to benefit one iota from @realDonaldTrump    Get out and vote in 2018 to take this country back
945839690107596800 2017-12-26 02:12:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP This is a man who lived off government assistance growing up, but totally wants to take it away.  This is the reason why the @realDonaldTrump @gop needs to go.  @SpeakerRyan needs to discuss why he did this to his state.  I'm all behind @IronStache to represent the US @votevets
945839000300019712 2017-12-26 02:09:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AC360 This is why his base needs to understand that's this will affect them directly.  It's not that you should trust @realDonaldTrump it's that you shouldn't ever believe him.
945832397760757761 2017-12-26 01:43:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jimsciutto @AC360 How do we get @GOP base to understand that this country isn't against him and that the real news is just uncovering his lies.  @realDonaldTrump really doesn't care about anyone but him and his friends.  I want to see the government cleaned up, but he's making it worse for you
945819033466785793 2017-12-26 00:50:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> To think the country is rigged or against you is sad.  But know we are all fighting the same battle to have a better country.   Hope @realDonaldTrump supporter reads this and knows we aren't fighting you, we want to make the USA for everyone, not the rich https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/posteverything/wp/2017/12/26/to-beat-president-trump-you-have-to-learn-to-think-like-his-supporters/?tid=ss_tw-amp&__twitter_impression=true
945806760660684803 2017-12-26 00:01:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @IronStache Make sure you get @votevets involved.  We want to show this country why the vets are a group to move us forward.   2018 is when we take our country back.
945792337527164928 2017-12-26 23:03:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @calif6native @r1chh007 @mosercounty This is so true.  He's owned by Russia and now the complicate @GOP is caught up on this.  2018 we have to take this country back!!
945783390996959232 2017-12-26 22:28:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ABC Funny how he retweeted that article where he won man of the year and didn't read the article.   They said he needed to retire
945781771458764802 2017-12-26 22:22:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump Glad you made your friends much richer.
945752668496187392 2017-12-26 20:26:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @shannonrwatts @JesseLehrich @cschmick @george_bugsy The tax bill was done in the dark with total disregard to any scores.  It was proven to be a tax positive for the ultra rich.  So... when independent agencies say this is bad and without any bipartisanship, yes, we can question. Such a sorry party @GOP.  Hey.. let's wait
945751655416508419 2017-12-26 20:22:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JesseLehrich Remember this @votevets when we take back this country.   Every @GOP needs to go.  Our government was built on checks and balances.   The ACa is unpopular with the @GOP but it wasn't done under the cloak of darkness and had open debates.  Not this #TaxScamBill
945749476861513728 2017-12-26 20:13:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LibyaLiberty Only the right winger ignorant @RealJamesWoods really hates the Muslim faith.  Real patriotism accepts all and doesn't try to influence others to believe them.  Why does @realDonaldTrump always say "believe me"?  His ignorance is real and @seanhannity @foxandfriends feeds him
945748453317054464 2017-12-26 20:09:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kwilli1046 Funniest thing ever.  He has lied over 1700 times.  It's why the USA will forget about the maga people and focus on the ones who want what the USA was founded on.   @votevets is a group of real Americans honoring the oath to fight both foreign and domestic enemies.
945747891368456200 2017-12-26 20:07:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @SandraTXAS @hrenee80 @bfraser747 @codeofvets @DonnaWR8 @kwilli1046 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @SiddonsDan @AmericanHotLips @Hoosiers1986 @POTUS @IsraelUSAforevr And you support your treasonous leader.  I'm appalled I shared a military branch with someone so filled with hate and ignorance.   @realDonaldTrump doesn't care about the military and only the rich.  2018 is when decency wins over hatred and toxic @gop
945746922580660226 2017-12-26 20:03:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoeNBC We will need your voice Joe in 2018 to get this county back.  I see a wave of patriotism unlike anything in decades. Alabama gave us the blueprint and the desire to overcome this toxic party is worth all the work.  This vet along with millions more want more for the USA.
945744591587872769 2017-12-26 19:54:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jlittleboy Time to energize the ones who want decency and honor in that office. 2018 is when real patriotism shows with genuine care for the USA. Alabama gave the country the blueprint to success
945739137126105089 2017-12-26 19:32:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oufenix @TeaPainUSA It's a Shame that @RealJamesWoods has to rely on this to stay relevant.  We all know he has been shunned
945738670614687745 2017-12-26 19:30:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ASYF2020 It's time for the people to take Riggs back.  Get out and work your community to get the @GOP maga trump loyalist out.  Make 2018 the year of patriotism and decency from this rancid leadership.  @votevets will help get the vet community engaging to save the USA
945730813097906176 2017-12-26 18:59:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY Like most of the @GOP , reading is a challenge.  Heard @realDonaldTrump needs picture books for his daily briefing
945710076828012545 2017-12-26 17:37:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @veterans_i Get our on the streets too.  Follow the Alabama blueprint to beat the bike and repulsive @GOP    If you can vote go vote.  If you aren't sure, look up what you need to do.   Help the people who need help getting our to vote.  Grassroots is the way we destroy this evilness
945693102622330880 2017-12-26 16:29:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @tmservo433 Plus we are motivated for the love of our country.  We are going to do grassroots efforts to ensure everyone who can vote knows how to.  AL gave us a great blueprint on how to defeat the alt right.   Real patriotism will show in 2018
945692357512650752 2017-12-26 16:26:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SethAbramson Worst part is that his massive ignorance of followers believe everything he says.  @realDonaldTrump is toxic to democracy and decency.  Yes... usaf vet here.
945676401415524353 2017-12-26 15:23:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @samstein Glad @senorrinhatch didn't actually read that article!!!   Time to take a seat in the back and let someone who loves their country and wallet take over.  Too bad your legacy has totally been tarnished with your self serving bill.  2018 #takebackus2018
945660252166459393 2017-12-26 14:19:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN I would agree and @votevets and the country will be taken back from this maga bs.  We the people will come together for a 2018 resumption
945654429226881024 2017-12-26 13:55:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen @de_schenk @HappyinaMini It's time unite and take this country back in 2018.   Alabama gave us the blueprint on how to start bringing some balance of power.  Any congressional member who supports maga needs to get voted out.  Let's show the world how patriotic we are when we work together
945653799275909122 2017-12-26 13:53:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @calif6native @r1chh007 @goldcoastdebb Thanks for the kind words.  We're in the biggest fight ever to get our country back and to show that we don't tolerate such ignorance and lying.  I love this country and will always defend it.
945653285641445377 2017-12-26 13:51:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @lsfarmer311 @kylegriffin1 When will someone in the media just call him a flat out liar!?   @foxandfriends could become a viable option to watch if they ever told some facts and let @realDonaldTrump know they know he's a liar and not loved
945649826900987904 2017-12-26 13:37:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @foxandfrlends @realDonaldTrump You don't watch tv but quote a non news station show daily.  Could @FoxNews @foxandfriends be the #FakeNews that are always talking about.  Maybe they play games with you to see if you would really repeat the wildly false topics.  #MuellerTime
945649200762585088 2017-12-26 13:35:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP Here is a race we have to win.  @senorrinhatch is now on the fence since he has bowed down to trump.  Utah needs to be like AL #takebackus2018https://www.rawstory.com/2017/12/utah-paper-drops-christmas-day-bomb-on-orin-hatch-for-his-lack-of-integrity-unquenchable-thirst-for-power/amp/?__twitter_impression=true
945645108308955136 2017-12-26 13:18:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @mshowerton Loved it.  Let's jump on the 2018 "take American back" from this disaster of a @GOP meltdown
945522359011827712 2017-12-25 05:11:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump This is where we start.  This is a list of candidates going against the @GOP   This us grassroots and we need to work as one.http://m.votevets.org/candidates
945521604305485824 2017-12-25 05:08:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @veterans_i Thanks for sharing this.   It's his we win our country back is by rallying behind the candidates.
945519948897669125 2017-12-25 05:01:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MoltonGeorge Get out in 2018 so we can all work as one team to take back the US from the @GOP    Once you profess your loyalty to @realDonaldTrump and not the constitution, you must go.   #MuellerTime #MuellerChristmas.  2018 will be the year of great patriotism that will move us forward
945515700503924736 2017-12-25 04:44:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @votevets @realDonaldTrump @GOP @AJMic7 @2B_Painfree Great response , it's a wonderful answer, the best answer ever.   Just trust me, I know more about great answers than anyone since I'm the smartest person and graduated from Wharton.   Ps... my hands are yuge 
945514840537178112 2017-12-25 04:41:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @votevets @AJMic7 @2B_Painfree No, not at all.  Anyone who devotes their loyalty to @realDonaldTrump needs to go.  I choose to defend the constitution with my life and want representatives to defend the constitution, not trump.   We are not North Korea.  Any @GOP who attaches themselves to maga needs out.
945513931816292352 2017-12-25 04:37:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @AJMic7 @2B_Painfree Great to hear.  We here in Ohio have some work to do, but we will work and work.  Keep up the great work and stay in touch.   Let's all work together @votevets to maximize our efforts to take back the US.  The vile @GOP is out of control.
945511853425340416 2017-12-25 04:29:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AJMic7 @2B_Painfree How was the movie?   Thanks for the thanks for serving.   Now is the hard but most rewarding work, take back the country.  Every @realDonaldTrump henchmen who doesn't have a single unique thought from the @GOP needs voted out.  Get involved in the community to make 2018 ours!
945504189265915904 2017-12-25 03:58:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Stonekettle Wonder if @EricTrump had the same foot problem as @realDonaldTrump ?   Can @FoxNews or @seanhannity please research?   We're excited to know how to honor the fallen from their ivory towers.  I buried my best friend and know how to honor him, take back the country in 2018
945503270054912000 2017-12-25 03:55:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RealJamesWoods Take a step away from the coke please.  We're worried we will find out about an OD from @TMZ with you and a prostitute with only one leg but wore a maga hat.
945502840759508999 2017-12-25 03:53:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepStevenSmith Your supreme leader @realDonaldTrump is a sexual predator and you are focused on this.  You are really an embarrassment since you clearly don't see a separation between religion and state.  Maybe you should read up on the constitution you agreed to uphold!
945501493188349953 2017-12-25 03:48:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @Shareblue @p1ssedoffbitch @Mystical_Moons @tararyze @dailyrotation We have to work as one to take this country back.  2018 will be the year of unbridled patriotism for the people of the US.  Alabama gave us the blueprint to best these vile people with a horrible view of our country
945499744142577664 2017-12-25 03:41:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Green_Footballs He's a @realDonaldTrump apologist.  @RealJamesWoods really is on an epic coke binge wishing he could find work again.
945499474138423296 2017-12-25 03:40:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @yashar Always a 180 tweet by @realDonaldTrump.  Never seen a more confused man who literally says what's on his mind regardless if it's true or not.  He may hate hearing how humble we think he is
945497744248057856 2017-12-25 03:33:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JudLounsbury We need to work as one to get the @GOP out of congress.  If we do this, we can minimize the damage and let #MuellerTime do his job.  @votevets knows the blueprint on how to win, the great citizens of Alabama showed us!   2018 is the year of patriotism and taking the country back
945496717646028801 2017-12-25 03:29:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Hope012015 @BigWinInTx It's sad that the ones @realDonaldTrump said he was going to take care of are the exact ones getting the short stick.  @votevets and 2018 will be a year of patriotism like never seen when we all work as one to move past this disaster.  We have to get the @GOP out of congress
945495856085651456 2017-12-25 03:25:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @GOP @yeahokisee Thank you.  I'm doing my small part, but if everyone did their part this will work out.  We need to make sure everyone in our communities can vote and know how.  Also, make sure they can get to vote.  It's early, but this needs to be a well executed mission.  2018 is ours
945494887578980352 2017-12-25 03:22:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @SPNPaulette @TTomtex @SaylesJon It's not going to be easy, but nothing worth fighting for is easy.  AL gave us the blueprint to win against the @GOP    I urge everyone who wants this country back to get involved in your community.  I promise a great wave of patriotism when we all work to destroy the enemy
945493859529822208 2017-12-25 03:17:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @oufenix Yes we do plus we are terrified on what he can do.   Most of us that served honorably didn't want a war; but knew what we had to do when called upon.  I see 2018 as the most patriotic year when the country rallies to defeat this toxic @GOP    AL gave us the blueprint
945493100914454528 2017-12-25 03:14:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @mjwatts1983 You are the man and thanks for the service.  Sad that we get fake Americans attacking us if we disagree with trump.  2018 will be a real transition to American values and patriotism when we win congress back!   Usaf here.
945492420929650689 2017-12-25 03:12:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @GOP @yeahokisee Sorry about your dad, but love the story.  He was a brilliant soldier and mentor.  We will make him proud when we all come together to minimize the damage and show that racism; sexism; and donors don't run the country, the citizens do!   2018 = patriotism and the American way
945491447259828224 2017-12-25 03:08:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @jillfeinsten5 Thank you, I was happy to serve.  I love this country and we have to win it back.  @votevets will get us all to band together as one team to win this back.  We got a little loose with our goals as a country but have a clear goal, get this back.  #MuellerTime #MuellerChristmas
945489621588246528 2017-12-25 03:01:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @yeahokisee Thank you and happy your dad would thank me.  Can't stress this enough, we take this country back by working with our local community to understand the issues and work for the candidate that supports your views.  @GOP is toxic as long as they support @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
945489086453829632 2017-12-25 02:58:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @2B_Painfree @AJMic7 I'm an airman with Semper Fi tattooed to my leg!   I love our country and what we gave our oath for.  @realDonaldTrump isn't what we fought for and many lost their lives too.   Follow the Alabama blueprint to win this country back.  No waiting on others, we take that hill as one
945488290190385153 2017-12-25 02:55:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @calif6native @r1chh007 @sharcat12 Thanks and Yes!   We need to do our part to follow the Alabama blueprint!    We all need to work as one team to research the candidates and help anyway we can.  Grassroots efforts won this country from England and will again from the toxic @GOP @votevets
945487615566012416 2017-12-25 02:53:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> We need to put this country on notice, especially our vets who @realDonaldTrump loves to pawn us.  2018 midterm & do everything you can.  Find out who's running from the @GOP and understand their positions.  AL gave us the blueprint to minimize damage & take back the US
945485870408269826 2017-12-25 02:46:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TonyGreyGoose @RawStory This is not only true, but tragic for the families involved.   Those bonus checks were promised before the tax bill was passed.  The @GOP @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews won't let the public know that.  To end this trash get out and start the movement in 2018
945484825183571968 2017-12-25 02:42:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @johnpavlovitz It's both plus they are easily distracted with fake theories about stealing their guns; giving all these benefits to immigrants; and they are the ones @realDonaldTrump are looking after.  Plus they sit and watch @seanhannity @FoxNews and literally believe everything @GOP
945482444945416195 2017-12-25 02:32:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @calif6native @r1chh007 That's very kind of you and an honor that doesn't go unnoticed.  Thanks you and now we need to get out and turn this disaster around in 2018!!
945482199926804481 2017-12-25 02:31:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @calif6native @r1chh007 @unclehernie I'm in agreement!   We all need to do more in 2018 to minimize the damage!!   Alabama gave us the blueprint to succeed!!!
945460685370216448 2017-12-25 01:06:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @votevets Mine was in Bahrain and missed so much back home.  But I did my job faithfully and never regretted anything.   Usaf!!!   Guaranteed that I will fight against @realDonaldTrump and his destruction to the USA.
945434413785079808 2017-12-25 23:21:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @BugeyedHolmes Only honor was getting a Purple Heart from another veteran.  Guess @realDonaldTrump had a war avoiding std's during Vietnam while others really fought.  Don't forget he knows more than all the generals, trust him!!
945415650947760128 2017-12-25 22:07:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @calif6native @r1chh007 I'm always going to honor my commitment and oath.   Always fight both foreign and domestic enemies.    2018 will be the time to take the country back from this toxic and self serving @realDonaldTrump    It's service before self, not self before country.
945414789513252867 2017-12-25 22:03:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP This is a great picture.  I appreciate the kind words @dash_bandy
945410031499046912 2017-12-25 21:44:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Too bad he has such a limited amount of words that he can use.
945409872568504320 2017-12-25 21:44:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @ShirleyChirch It's great that the vets that died and fought for our freedom against a foreign country are now fighting the same battle inside our borders.  It's @SheriffClarke @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr are the real threats to our country.  #MuellerTime #MuellerChristmas
945319309580128257 2017-12-25 15:44:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @wendeelue You are welcome and merry Christmas.   2018 is a referendum on decency and we all as a country get out and vote.
945319063777050629 2017-12-25 15:43:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @KeithJohnDuffie This will be a test of decency and democracy in 2018 to ensure we limit what damage he does.  Get out and vote; get your friends to vote!
945279430024466432 2017-12-25 13:05:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WhosThatNumber7 I'll accept that challenge.  I love seeing the next generation stand up for something and push us all to be better.  Great work on sharing this.  Always pay forward
945278849394331648 2017-12-25 13:03:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tiffany1985B Why did guys ever stop pouring them.   Irish coffee then mimosas  merry Christmas dear to you and the family. 
945138075541430272 2017-12-24 03:44:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @attilathehoneyb @The_UnSilent_ @twiticulture Other was mine then said how I really felt about @realDonaldTrump
945137885392654336 2017-12-24 03:43:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @The_UnSilent_ I just took this bs pool and waiting for the @GOP to hit me up for money since they automatically assumed only @realDonaldTrump following would take such an biased pool.
945126977299722240 2017-12-24 03:00:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @shawgerald4 Seriously surprised she's not wearing any of your crappy clothes.
945126575284084736 2017-12-24 02:58:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump You didn't bring it back.  Seriously it's late Christmas Eve and you clearly don't have any love  around since you are making up stuff.  Get a life and merry effing Christmas you pos.
945105942307368960 2017-12-24 01:36:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oufenix @DonCheadle The @realDonaldTrump gang sure loves to promote fake accomplishments!!   Meet Christmas has always been around but his followers think he brought it back.  They will follow their supreme leader and follow him unconditionally. #MuellerChristmas
945093069216632832 2017-12-24 00:45:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @EdKrassen Hey @TGowdySC thoughts on this?   How's @realDonaldTrump  taste?
945075913057800194 2017-12-24 23:37:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @tedlieu @Bee30758370 @DavidFW1979 @gregoryfcooper It's @FoxNews and you still believe it.  Haha.  Do you believe all the ignorance that @seanhannity and @TuckerCarlson says?!?!?   I hope not since you are the ones getting hosed with all he does unless you are a 1%er
945075453890572288 2017-12-24 23:35:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @tedlieu Funny how the pro supreme leader followers of @realDonaldTrump are trying to change the narrative with fake facts.  Or as the trump team says #AlternativeFacts #MuellerChristmas can't come fast enough.   These trump supporter don't have a single original thought.
945071268440748033 2017-12-24 23:18:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @united @truthcraving @JeanMarieSimon1 @lcj2137 @Isophorone You realize your supreme leader @realDonaldTrump is up over 90m to stay at his property?   You are literally worried over 400!  Laughable actually.  #MuellerChristmas
945070538531180544 2017-12-24 23:15:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AG_Conservative Please tweet every single time @realDonaldTrump lies.  I'm expecting you to be very busy.  #MuellerChristmas    I'll follow you to ensure I see 1600+ in the next 11 months.
945070116731047937 2017-12-24 23:14:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @guypbenson Dare you say #FakeNews    When will you ever say that @realDonaldTrump has continued to lie and lie.  He's creating the problem with fake news
945069302620852226 2017-12-24 23:10:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @RPMMAS It's going to be a #MuellerChristmas this year!!!
945046362349064192 2017-12-24 21:39:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GOP @maltfalcon77 Not this vet!!
945045821489319939 2017-12-24 21:37:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Don't put me in this bucket.  As a veteran I hate the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump    I fought for freedom and would have struggled to accept any orders from this group.   Please don't ever assume a vet is on your side.
945038310354948096 2017-12-24 21:07:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Sangria1992 @tedlieu I love that you are willing to stand up to @realDonaldTrump and his supreme ego.  I wish more representatives would call it like it is, he's not wearing any clothes.   The bots are all over today.  At least I hope they are bots or I really am concerned with your constituents
945014878787526661 2017-12-24 19:34:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MSNBC @stephmclark66 Make sure @hughhewitt knows how his right wing @realDonaldTrump suck up job isn't good for our country
944995690983325696 2017-12-24 18:18:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oufenix @ThePlumLineGS Oh @realDonaldTrump that's not good for you.  Looks like the trump households @DonaldJTrumpJr won't be doing a toast to a #MuellerChristmas #MuellerTime
944986827991212034 2017-12-24 17:43:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @renato_mariotti Where is Kelly at during all this?  @realDonaldTrump is unhinged and they need to take his phone away till after the New Years.   The @FBI is doing their job and protecting the US and trump is critical since they know he is dirty.
944325477627547648 2017-12-22 21:55:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Thanks @realDonaldTrump for allowing your followers to use fake fake news as an excuse for lying.  US ambassador denies own comments, then denies denialhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/12/22/politics/us-ambassador-to-netherlands-denies-own-comments/index.html?__twitter_impression=true
944264282828607488 2017-12-22 17:52:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Since this is @FoxNews does that mean that @realDonaldTrump will accept this as fact?   Hmmmmmm
944018185975619584 2017-12-21 01:34:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Scottishblood 
943984603014057984 2017-12-21 23:20:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @JohnBrennan @philipsturner @LPsupportsTrump Bot
943984040897662976 2017-12-21 23:18:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oufenix @repjohnlewis Because the @GOP @senrobportman @SenateMajLdr all bow to their supreme leader @realDonaldTrump and his massive ego that's Russian funded.  So let's not question why, but start a real grass roots effort to vote them out.  Out fore fathers gave us the tools to remove Donald
943983459881582592 2017-12-21 23:16:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @oufenix @RepJoeKennedy So what will the @GOP hold over the dems to fund this.  Remember if you read @realDonaldTrump book ( that he didn't write) his theory is to pound when you have something they want (yes, children health care).  So what will @SenateMajLdr use to negotiate children care?
943981572386119680 2017-12-21 23:08:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @votevets And we fought for people like @DevinNunes to represent us is appalling.  I fought to better our country, not self serving @gop sycophants on the @realDonaldTrump taint
943961338560303105 2017-12-21 21:48:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DavidAFrench Explain when the medical expenses and deductions go through the roof.  That 1k extra won't seem like much.   Also.... is that 1k before or after taxes
943912411790180352 2017-12-21 18:33:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PPact @EWTN @MarshaBlackburn You are just as bad as your supreme leader @realDonaldTrump     Lies and lies and take advantage of the ill informed and uneducated.  You are disgusting and disgracing your state.
943911699358343169 2017-12-21 18:31:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MarshaBlackburn You are spreading fake news to your constituents.  Seriously this narrative has been proven false.  I would expect more but you keep failing.
943875516259594240 2017-12-21 16:07:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Any fan of the @GOP should read this!!   Its hilarious that if you aren't a large earner and still support him and poor, you wrre officially duped.  No tax cuts for Christmas? Trump might delay bill signinghttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-tax-cuts-christmas-trump-212713167.html
943869318076551169 2017-12-21 15:42:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt Yea Hugh, his word is meaningless since he's over 1600 lies.  For an educated person Hugh, I'm surprised you think this could not happen.  #MuellerTime
943868876122664960 2017-12-21 15:40:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SykesCharlie Can we agree that this is a "believe me" from @realDonaldTrump.  It means you are a sucker for listening to me.
943843294378946560 2017-12-21 13:59:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @harveyjkaye Good day Harvey.
943685366392946689 2017-12-20 03:31:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @NancyAFrench @benshapiro They were all bribed by lobbyist and big corporation
943661618478698496 2017-12-20 01:57:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AC360 Anything this pos @Jim_Jordan says is a lie.  He's a trump 
943651465012436993 2017-12-20 01:16:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ASlavitt Guess "believe me" is not the same as we will do it.  Thanks for your vote and now go away. You @SenatorCollins really are a sucker
943637498177245186 2017-12-20 00:21:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chucktodd Playing to his massive ego.  Merger going through if they say it's because of @realDonaldTrump
943598225721880578 2017-12-20 21:45:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP I am looking forward to some grassroots efforts in 2018.  Hold these @gop accountable!   How the Trump Tax Cuts Solved the Democrats Campaign Problem - New York Magazine.https://apple.news/As1U6aXDHSxmqIobIxELsrg
943560637002764288 2017-12-20 19:16:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost When the poor people who have no insurance for their family or kids see how bad this was, it will be too late.  @realDoanldTramp @GOP made it you who will ultimately pay the price.  But you will still have your guns and conspiracy theories.  #MuellerTime
943490259664408577 2017-12-20 14:36:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MeetThePress That was before that saved him millions with his #CorkerKickbacks
943487544578199552 2017-12-20 14:25:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Reuters Only if 89% of the country gets into real estate; gas; oil; coal; dirty water; dirty air.  Then I can see his numbers skyrocketing for sure.  #MuellerTime
943486756762071043 2017-12-20 14:22:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper It's sad to see him leave @Indians    He was great for the team and community.  I wish @TheRealSlamtana all the best and look forward to seeing you back in Cleveland one day.  Keep swinging
943481899921608704 2017-12-20 14:03:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Big shout out to @senrobportman @SenateMajLdr and all @GOP.  It's clear that you never served and put country before self.  I fought for this great country and always put it first.  I will get a significant tax cut with my earnings but it's not what's best for our country.  Usaf
943262219705479168 2017-12-19 23:30:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @BeltwayBaca @jaketapper +1 for jack.   I love bringing facts to any @GOP argument and watch them shut down or say something nasty that's a personal insult. Thanks @realDonaldTrump for that lesson on winning 
943206397835206656 2017-12-19 19:48:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoeNBC Shocked so many think he is honest.  What's wrong with our ignorant behavior
943171308845662209 2017-12-19 17:28:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Doesn't matter.  You will still go to prison.  #LockHimUp
943170841939980288 2017-12-19 17:27:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JohnCornyn Good to see you really know how the American families make their money.  You are so incredibly tone deaf and spin master.  Do the same math with: Married household making 60k with no pass through income.  Dare you #TaxBillScam
943120187733299200 2017-12-19 14:05:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ASlavitt This is the trump tactic to bully to get what you want.  Unfortunately this affects our youth.
943105979058704384 2017-12-19 13:09:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nowthisnews Sadly @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS couldn't do this.   He would think showing any love is a weakness.  It's actually sad for him

942960640909627395 2017-12-18 03:31:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @tedlieu Please never ask @PressSec to know what the truth is.  I'm hoping her deep devotion to her faith keeps her sleeping at night.  But though shall not lie isn't in her future under her supreme leader
942959396216365056 2017-12-18 03:26:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepAdamSchiff @TucsonLinda14 Stay strong!!
942959151164067840 2017-12-18 03:25:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepAdamSchiff Why can't we see his tax returns?   Does no one in the @GOP care how self serving this fake @realDonaldTrump is
942956657818120192 2017-12-18 03:16:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SRuhle I guess when I hear "believe me" I know it's a lie.  We have to thank @realDonaldTrump for that
942952073456480256 2017-12-18 02:57:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LindseyGrahamSC Go away you kook.  How quick you flip on your own principles.   What... we North Korea now you and have to follow your supreme leader?!?!
942951712486248448 2017-12-18 02:56:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Ummm.  You follow your own propaganda.
942938317653446656 2017-12-18 02:03:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepSwalwell And you support impeachment
942938011683164161 2017-12-18 02:01:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @aliasvaughn Can we get a picture of @DonaldJTrumpJr literally urinating all over himself when the cover of daddy is gone.
942937689879400448 2017-12-18 02:00:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JeffFlake Then defend him against the dictator @realDonaldTrump
942876225218981890 2017-12-18 21:56:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepMattGaetz @funder Simple civics class would explain this.  I'm too tired to explain all this to matt.  Plus he maybe on his 5th drink and won't remember anyways.
942865739396124674 2017-12-18 21:14:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SkinnerPm Nope.  Just the @realDonaldTrump followers who can't get an opinion on their own.
942851325238415360 2017-12-18 20:17:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @votevets But putin said nice things about me.  So I don't want to hear about this.  #MuellerTime  usafvet
942849667494301697 2017-12-18 20:10:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DavidCornDC Hey @realDonaldTrump maybe take the #fakenews war on Christmas to your less than stellar family.  Notice only happy holiday coming out of @IvankaTrump @EricTrump #MoronInChief
942848107762548738 2017-12-18 20:04:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas But #FakeNews @FoxNews would never cover this.  Plus I'm not sure the @GOP followers know how to read and research.
942847521692508162 2017-12-18 20:02:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost I'm sad to hear this.  Trump gave us every reason and opportunity to disqualify him yet less than half American still voted for him.  @realDonaldTrump is the con in this.   #MuellerTime #ProtectMueller
942846464128159745 2017-12-18 19:58:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Acosta Because it's all about him.
942846277846552576 2017-12-18 19:57:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @Uncle_Jimbo @AWilliford7 @MAH0310 Yep.  Cutest post ever.  Know what they say how to argue with the ignorant and ill informed?
942828468844318722 2017-12-18 18:46:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jbendery Probably best for him and our legal system.  If you aren't qualified for the role then get out.  Too bad @realDonaldTrump didn't see how unqualified he is.
942828021572096000 2017-12-18 18:44:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TruthFeedNews @beachkatie This is a fake news station.  Sorry to bum out the people who don't research this.  #FakeNews
942820842425200641 2017-12-18 18:16:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @EdKrassen Guess having everyone bow to you is good for your administration.  Unfortunately we are about checks and balances!! #MuellerTime #ProtectMueller
942820278635253765 2017-12-18 18:14:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @IvankaTrump @funder Let's get on to #MuellerTime so we can get this disgusting family out from representation of our country
942817654427078656 2017-12-18 18:03:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @tedlieu It's @FoxNews that's the real #FakeNews    They are an entertaining company.  Not a reliable news organization.  Too bad @GOP followers won't ever question anything they read or watch.
942815359383625728 2017-12-18 17:54:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepDeSantis @funder Find out why @Jim_Jordan is so focused on shutting down the special counsel!!   He's going all in with his conspiracy theories he learned from fake news @FoxNews #ProtectMueller #MuellerTime
942812076963237890 2017-12-18 17:41:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Your dad leaked them to Russia in the White House you dolt.  Your spin cycles are hilarious.  Stop drinking jr.  It's bad for your already damaged brand.
942796356913127424 2017-12-18 16:39:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @tribelaw Now get out and vote.  Be there when history is made.
942795877856563200 2017-12-18 16:37:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @Uncle_Jimbo @AWilliford7 Funny how @DonaldJTrumpJr only retweets @FoxNews @RealJamesWoods    Such reliable sources.   It's #ProtectMueller #MuellerTime !!!
942792075334094853 2017-12-18 16:22:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @mkraju @SaraMurray @JDiamond1 @JohnBerman We all know this is the famous "trust me" "believe me" bs from @POTUS    Its #ProtectMueller #MuellerTime
942788670834315264 2017-12-18 16:08:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SykesCharlie Sad when you see #FakeNews trending and 90%+ is far right critical of anything negative about @realDonaldTrump.  Please keep calling him out for not wearing any clothes
942788188996866048 2017-12-18 16:06:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Real question @tedcruz , how could anyone believe that you will support our constitutional rights above party when you didn't defend your wife when @realDonaldTrump insulted her.  You rolled on your back and endorsed him.  How can we trust you and she never got an apology
942787511285374979 2017-12-18 16:03:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost This isn't a political issue.  It's unfortunate that he didn't learn that it's not ok to hit anyone.  I hope the legal system punishes appropriately.
942787099211780096 2017-12-18 16:02:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WiStateJournal @Imkevinfarley Sorry to read this.  Still can't believe it's been 20 years!!!   I still go back and watch him and just laugh.
942773872708988931 2017-12-18 15:09:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kylegriffin1 Sadly he's either incredibly tone deaf or woefully ignorant and is clearly lacking any good quality to  be @POTUS
942773372785713152 2017-12-18 15:07:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @votevets Another brick in the wall of trumps woefully negative legacy.
942773140089917440 2017-12-18 15:06:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @krassenstein Yes I'm sure he is.  Won't fire the man and his team that will destroy his corrupt regime.  It's #MuellerTime
942763633838379008 2017-12-18 14:29:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepAdamSchiff @FrakerMonica @Ludla3389 @AlTrumpTrain This is what you call "irresponsible ".  If someone disagrees with you shouldn't solicit a bully response.  This is acting like @realDonaldTrump and why the @GOP has a cult like follow that won't research anything you say
942752648226377729 2017-12-18 13:45:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt You are really leaning on the @realDonaldTrump cult like followers for ratings.  How about you cover the great international embarrassment he has become and how he's damaging our country and earth for ever.  Also what about the 1600 + lies told!   #FakeNews and
942751641639571456 2017-12-18 13:41:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @laurenduca This is what you call "irresponsible ".  If someone disagrees with you shouldn't solicit a bully response.

942751332926152704 2017-12-18 13:40:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Browns @justinjm1 @GideonResnick @Catenigma Yea, lay off the Browns.  Let's keep poorly ran and talentless from the @GOP     They are both plus greedy, ill informed, and have a cult leader, we just don't have a quarterback
942749742576160768 2017-12-18 13:33:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MikeLevinCA Please don't try and reason with anyone with the @GOP    They see @FoxNews as godlike and can't see how they are #FakeNews.
942749376602132480 2017-12-18 13:32:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SarahKSilverman This is starting to sound awfully familiar to how nazi Germany got started.  @FoxNews becomes the state media and all others called #FakeNews , what's presented to the people has been cleansed, and then we are forced to show loyalty to @realDonaldTrump.
942748174548160513 2017-12-18 13:27:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Wilcox_Music This is what you call "irresponsible ".  If someone disagrees with you shouldn't solicit a bully response.

942747402754289664 2017-12-18 13:24:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump See where you put @FoxNews @foxandfriends , that's an indication that this needs to be researched because it's #FakeNews    See how this works.  He clearly forgot he did endorse Moore and lost!   This was last week.  It's #MuellerTime
942746340911706113 2017-12-18 13:20:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @tedcruz @joannabalesca This is the response you get when you literally try to offer any input to a trump follower @aliasvaughn @EdKrassen @SykesCharlie @funder @krassenstein   Can we just sympathize for them to be so blinded by @realDonaldTrump
942745898647420930 2017-12-18 13:18:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @joannabalesca Yes, great response.  Shall I call you a name?   Sadly I'm not one to try and belittle you.
942744488799277056 2017-12-18 13:12:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @joannabalesca This is what you call "irresponsible ".  If someone disagrees with you shouldn't solicit a bully response.

942743324838023168 2017-12-18 13:08:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RonNehring It's @FoxNews and is the real #FakeNews.  The saddest part is that fox has been proven to be a fake news outlet for the @GOP, yet his followers don't know the difference and won't take a second to research their "stories" covered as news.
942619807869960192 2017-12-17 04:57:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @Uncle_Jimbo It's @FoxNews jr, it's fake.  Please put down the drink.  It's #MuellerTime buddy.
942608020395175937 2017-12-17 04:10:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @thehill The real question @DonaldJTrumpJr is how you think @tedcruz is winning.  Guess your definition of winning is like daddies.  #MuellerTime
942602246411472896 2017-12-17 03:47:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> GOP tax bill would set up years of challenges https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-tax-bill-would-set-up-years-of-challenges-1513557742 via @WSJ
942598084701360128 2017-12-17 03:31:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kibblesmith Love that hat.  So presidential.  I'm sure he's making money on that hat.
942597874612883457 2017-12-17 03:30:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @HillaryClinton @TuckerCarlson It's coming from tuckie and @FoxNews    Totally unreliable and #FakeNews.  Jr, please stop drinking and tweeting.
942597157554737153 2017-12-17 03:27:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> It's breitbart -= #FakeNews    Plus I didn't know @RealJamesWoods was still relevant.  Plus jr is retweeting you and breitbart.  I can't pick on you two, it's just so easy.
942596621623349248 2017-12-17 03:25:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr What about all the women accusing daddy.  How dumb are you?   It's not even fair to pick on you.
942579537111633921 2017-12-17 02:17:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @EdKrassen Not too mention that Putin called to thank us for our information on an isis attach.  So Putin believes in our intelligence agencies?
942568883571122176 2017-12-17 01:35:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WalshFreedom @BrianMora_USA You really don't understand how a special counsel works.  Keep in mind #MuellerTime has been following the law.  Do yourself a quick favor and watch the Rotheinstein interview to congress.  I'm paraphrasing but he said he's done nothing wrong.  Oh, both of them are @GOP
942560331645292544 2017-12-17 01:01:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @evanperez Hey @DonaldJTrumpJr notice criminal was there 2 times?   Hmmmmmm.  Maybe you should be safe, trust me.
942560001008242688 2017-12-17 00:59:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @OhioState @senrobportman And to blindly follow their supreme leader @realDonaldTrump and not have a unique thought.   I hope you didn't say what you do and said what you should do.
942559171068743681 2017-12-17 00:56:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @taxvictim This is classic!!!   #MuellerTime #Mueller #ImpeachTrump
942553365862600706 2017-12-17 00:33:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LeBatardShow 
942552225003573254 2017-12-17 00:28:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SenBobCorker @jimsciutto Because the @GOP only wants a bill passed.  Maybe knowing why @realDonaldTrump would save could give some insight as to why he's pushing so hard for this and why he won't give up his taxes.  But @senrobportman doesn't care since his pockets will be lined even more
942551324889055232 2017-12-17 00:25:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Ali_H_Soufan Only the @GOP would allow these ignorant racist to be accepted as one of them.  Thanks @realDonaldTrump for your views where they can come out and say such ignorant thoughts
942550796213858304 2017-12-17 00:23:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AdyBarkan Ignorance isn't a defense!!  @SenBobCorker needs to say no and make his legacy as someone who stood up to @realDonaldTrump    Don't be a yes man and say no!!!   Get @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins to say No
942550316402212865 2017-12-17 00:21:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @crampell Then tell your fellow @GOP to say no!!   #TaxScamBill
942546690984341505 2017-12-17 00:06:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JenAshleyWright But @DonaldJTrumpJr thought that teddy won that.  Clearly JR can't follow a thread.  We all knew the whole trump family was dumb, but @DonaldJTrumpJr is at the top of the stupid tree 
942543400259215360 2017-12-17 23:53:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Alyssa_Milano Help get scum like @Jim_Jordan out of the house too!   Ohio doesn't want him and all he does is defend and deflect from @realDonaldTrump !!!   Help in Ohio is what we want from you. #ProtectMueller
942541623409479680 2017-12-17 23:46:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @marcushjohnson It's the party that @Jim_Jordan @senrobportman @realDonaldTrump have created with @FoxNews supporting their outlandish theories.  Mueller is playing chess against these checker players!   Not too mention that #MuellerTime is a true American who fought for our country
942541044264194048 2017-12-17 23:44:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SenBobCorker @RoseAnnDeMoro Oh but @marcorubio sold his soul for a few bucks for poor Americans do he can say he fights for them.  Now he will use this to gain strength in the @GOP because he got what he wanted.  He's just as bad as #GOPTaxScamBill
942540007952322561 2017-12-17 23:40:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes And no one is screaming for his taxes!!!!!  Cowards @GOP   How much money will Donnie save with this plan?!?   Oh who cares is the @GOP motto.  @Jim_Jordan @senrobportman @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr choose party over country.  When I served it was service before self.
942538762642493446 2017-12-17 23:35:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Your family is the most tone deaf people in the world.  When in doubt, deflect.  Is it true you pissed the bed all the time in college and talked poorly about your dad and how he treated mom?!
942537319168532481 2017-12-17 23:29:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @maggieNYT My people?   It's sad that he thinks he owns his staff and military.
942536984265986049 2017-12-17 23:28:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jchaltiwanger She's almost a cartoon.  Can't wait to see these @realDonaldTrump followers out of the press.
942536591490338822 2017-12-17 23:26:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TheTerry_25 Totally a proud moment and nothing that can be taken from you.  I was on campus for my daughter and saw many graduates walking with proud families in their well earned cap and gowns!
942536223754739712 2017-12-17 23:25:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY Trust me and believe me right?  That's what's he's selling us.  @realDonaldTrump is not capable of telling the truth.  Wish the @GOP would call him out and say he's not wearing any clothes
942535678025486336 2017-12-17 23:23:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @cavs @senrobportman Get off twitter.
942535581275447296 2017-12-17 23:22:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @VP @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt @DrBlogstein @franksinclair17 If these people truly cared for our country and not their wallets, they would call out this sham of a president.  For the right wing nuts out there, I served honorably and also a 1% er.  There is a thing called service before self and country before self.
942524624822263810 2017-12-17 22:39:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SalvationArmyUS @hughhewitt Oh believe me is a true iron clad answer I will take to the bank.  Come on Hugh, you know his word is useless.
942521282461134849 2017-12-17 22:25:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @funder It's all about him!!   He will come back if I need his vote.  Love that hat too, bravo for acting and looking like a moron.
942520767392174081 2017-12-17 22:23:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @VP @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt @DrBlogstein I know.  He just falls in line with the others and has his alt right radio show daily.  Funny that he is so trump when he ran the Nixon library
942520208098504704 2017-12-17 22:21:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @danpfeiffer Just trust me would be the scariest thing @realDonaldTrump says.  It's a crap shoot from there.
942519988887457793 2017-12-17 22:20:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @VP @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt Think they talked about the investigation and also how you and your fellow @FoxNews will spin and damaging information coming out soon.  Also, what does the government do if he tries to fire the special counsel?
942514575261528064 2017-12-17 21:59:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SethAbramson @JakeMLarson @LifLarry @omgitsjen @JTRJules It's a stretch for @SpeakerRyan to do anything.  He's a spineless lackey to his supreme leader @realDonaldTrump
942503491515375620 2017-12-17 21:15:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ChrisLu44 But his followers don't care.  It's the world against @realDonaldTrump    They are like n Koreans and bow to their supreme leader.  Guess democracy is convenient to trump supporters
942501869653544961 2017-12-17 21:08:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @businessinsider Best plane around.  Loved that when I served.   The angel from above!
942501580598841349 2017-12-17 21:07:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNNOpinion @CNN If you aren't hiding anything @realDonaldTrump why all this unnecessary noise?   If I were not guilty I'd invite them in show them around.  Can't wait for you and blowholes like @Jim_Jordan are not representative of the USA!
942499539164024833 2017-12-17 20:59:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @thedailybeast Hope he gets well soon.  Now we need one or two others to flip.
942463248783282176 2017-12-17 18:35:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @dcexaminer @DonaldJTrumpJr He's a pansy to your dad.  Guess it runs in your family.
942430940302888960 2017-12-17 16:27:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Funny that you follow @Jim_Jordan    He's a total disgrace to the state of Ohio.  We can't wait to vote him out.
942413835209756672 2017-12-17 15:19:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Guess @realDonaldTrump is really trying to create the chaos he so loves.  I can't wait till our country gets to tell him he's fired!!

942243720262537216 2017-12-16 04:03:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GovHowardDean @arleendamico No joking here.  @realDonaldTrump should be seen for what he is, a self proclaimed king not wearing any clothes
942241541900460034 2017-12-16 03:54:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Shareblue So much lacking in common sense with @realDonaldTrump
942240692729995264 2017-12-16 03:51:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @4everNeverTrump The irresponsible behavior from @GOP @realDonaldTrump has no boundaries.  The only #maga is to get him out of office!
941842297922002945 2017-12-15 01:27:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LeifHanson7 Done!!   That's a win win.

941809178070454272 2017-12-15 23:16:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @aliasvaughn Plus Mueller likes to ruin weekends and family time for the accused!!   Plenty of time.  Plus justice doesn't sleep.

941803472890073088 2017-12-15 22:53:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Comey @Realjmannarino @Auburn_Mike43 You are so right, everything @FoxNews is clearly real!   Oh we are doomed as a country if our citizens only watch fox
941803041526829056 2017-12-15 22:51:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @kylegriffin1 I'm sure that the @GOP @Jim_Jordan will say this is against the democratic way.  But.... you are literally against democracy and need to be voted out!!!  2018
941801452120559616 2017-12-15 22:45:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNBC @JimInhofe Thanks Hugh, we believe everything you say now.
941801349498507264 2017-12-15 22:45:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper They are angry @realDonaldTrump and his followers!!!
941795752703127552 2017-12-15 22:22:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Hey @hughhewitt do you agree with this?   Sounds very reasonable to the educated world but maybe your JD has another opinion.   I agree with @aliasvaughn
941767011276701696 2017-12-15 20:28:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SeanAstin @AjitPaiFCC @CaseyHinds @MackenzieAstin Please help explain this?!?   I saw my name on some comments too and as you laugh at your colleagues, I am against this too.
941765799294812160 2017-12-15 20:23:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan @seanhannity @elrick @aprogolf Totally agree with listening to all sides then doing your own research.  Some just stay on one side and see it as gospel without any common decency and intellect
941765463536578560 2017-12-15 20:22:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper @gelles Is Sessions getting a spine and standing up against his loyal leader?!?
941760036547780608 2017-12-15 20:01:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @funder Mueller clearly is ahead of @realDonaldTrump and his supreme brain.  Just keep trusting trump and see how long till you realize he's the king in no clothes.
941716453799157761 2017-12-15 17:07:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ProgressOhio @PolicyMattersOH I really don't see @senrobportman really caring about anyone but his supreme leader in @realDonaldTrump    He just won an election and is one of the wealthiest in the senate.  He's doing what he is told.  2018 is when we take the country back from the right wing nuts
941689263510425601 2017-12-15 15:19:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Yep.  That's what you keep telling us.   At least you talk with civility when you lie, @Jim_Jordan just yells his lies and conspiracies
941665533228920832 2017-12-15 13:45:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Alt_Spicerlies @lauferlaw @aliasvaughn Let's add @hughhewitt if he can help, he does have a JD as well.
941665193729413121 2017-12-15 13:44:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @IronStache @tedlieu We need this same enthusiasm as WI and AL had in voting out @realDonaldTrump puppets like @Jim_Jordan    Let's get our country back on track for everyone, not just the top 1%.  @ProgressOhio let's get the grassroots support to change out the toxic representatives
941656199296143360 2017-12-15 13:08:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoyceBeatty @realDonaldTrump @HouseJudiciary @RepAdamSchiff @tburages @Barkforlove1 @MutinousSpirits We are lucky to have her!! We need to rid our state of @Jim_Jordan , total cancer to our democracy!!   Let's go Ohio and get him out.  Alabama gave us the blueprint to exterminate these roaches
941577085193244672 2017-12-14 07:54:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ryanosaurus716 Thanks @netflix for standing up for the people.  We were founded on we the people, now we are we the top 1%
941576459432484864 2017-12-14 07:51:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Great read about @Jim_Jordan from a former peer of his.  I agree totally with this assessment and implore all people in Ohio to get him out. John Boehner: Jordan, Chaffetz are 'a--holes'http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/357745-john-boehner-jason-chaffetz-is-an-asshole
941573813296386048 2017-12-14 07:41:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DemitriDawson Tell that to conspiracy theories galore @Jim_Jordan.  We need jim out from Ohio!!!   Grass roots effort to replace the Bannon @GOP    Alabama gave us the blueprint for succeeding against that regime.  Get the word out
941567647736651776 2017-12-14 07:16:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Senate_Fund We need this affect to hit ohio so we can get rid of @Jim_Jordan the spastic and irresponsible @GOP lackey.  He has to go so let's use the AL blueprint and get the movement in motion now.  @llstudent08 please get this out to your network
941566420193771520 2017-12-14 07:11:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TopherSpiro This could start the eventual fall of the Bannon @GOP    Stand up, then work with all 100 for a bill we all support.
941565076519211008 2017-12-14 07:06:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SethAbramson @TimTwmiley Vote in 2018 and keep getting the word out.  It's a full on team effort and the state of AL gave the USA the blueprint to defeat this regime.
941564708728995840 2017-12-14 07:04:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SethAbramson The @GOP won't care.  They just want to start their little fiefdoms with trump followers.  2018 we all have to get out and vote!!!
941564211741765632 2017-12-14 07:02:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan @votevets @WadeSChurch Keep retweeting and getting more on your tweets.  This man is a menace to democracy and we want him done representing Ohio.  He's a Bannon and trump goon.
941560259491041281 2017-12-14 06:47:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @votevets @WadeSChurch I promise that @Jim_Jordan doesn't represent the majority of Ohio.  Get the word out so we can do what we did in AL here in Ohio.  I want that conspiracy theory @realDonaldTrump lackey not representing me.

941529387555610629 2017-12-14 04:44:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianstelter Hey @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr is this real or fake news?  I need your supreme brain power to help me.  Believe me, I think you are both smarter than me.  Believe me also when I say @Jim_Jordan is highly appreciated.  Believe me! 
941527237039394816 2017-12-14 04:36:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoyAnnReid Insulting the widow of a soldier.   Insulting women; disparaging the justice department; calling any media that says anything he disagrees with fake.  Failing to implement Russian sanctions; embarrassed us on the national stage; pick fights with allies.
941525687722283008 2017-12-14 04:29:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AG_Conservative @guypbenson @jberkley17 The @GOP only wants to discredit mueller and is allowing all this bs under their noses.  You have blowhards like @Jim_Jordan spreading theories while doing nothing of any value.
941525164549984263 2017-12-14 04:27:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper @guypbenson Bravo @realDonaldTrump this is the person you put of for a judge!   Too bad the right wing media is only focused on discrediting mueller and not seeing what's really happening.  A shout out to @FoxNews @hughhewitt for great news that's focused on right wing
941523080563785728 2017-12-14 04:19:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper @guypbenson It's a shame that @hughhewitt doesn't cover this.  As a JD and one to support the constitution, how can you not cover this?   Maybe @realDonaldTrump doesn't want you too.
941522417809321984 2017-12-14 04:16:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt @LisaSeaFL Hey @Jim_Jordan why haven't they?   You on the payroll too!
941522078699868160 2017-12-14 04:15:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt You are such a part of the divide in this country.  Allowing your party to undermine the judiciary system is not only careless it's dangerous.  Clearly your JD isn't working for the betterment of our country.  @Jim_Jordan is a @realDonaldTrump foot soldier.
941521275830358016 2017-12-14 04:12:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FBI @TomFitton @EdKrassen Put in clowns  @realDonaldTrump that only watch @FoxNews and his followers should expect a circus.   This is as irresponsible as one can get and even fox shouldn't let this on air.  Ratings and money over country.
941519494438113280 2017-12-14 04:05:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Trump doesn't even really know what's in the bill.  Ask questions to him and let's really understand his comprehension skills.  My guess is @realDonaldTrump would fail that test.
941518672564285440 2017-12-14 04:01:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @benshapiro @agent18209 Nothing wrong with the title.  The internet will have changes yet fully understood.  You are misleading your followers and your loyalty to your master @realDonaldTrump
941516527622348801 2017-12-14 03:53:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt @DawgsByNature This is what we root for as a Browns fan 
941515648424914944 2017-12-14 03:49:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MSNBC @AjitPaiFCC @hughhewitt You are part of the divide in our country.  You tell only the @realDonaldTrump agenda and never hold him accountable.  You know the tax bill is good for the rich and a sham for every one else.
941515160480571392 2017-12-14 03:48:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SpeakerRyan @Reuters @USCentrist @Dargon74 Save the country and begin the impeachment process.  That should be your legacy.
941514837355646977 2017-12-14 03:46:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Reuters He's pulling the @realDonaldTrump on us, I quit so you can't say I was fired.  He will push is horrible bill that makes him millions, live off the government like he has his whole life.
941495281149009920 2017-12-14 02:29:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt You are creating the divide.  You have a voice and push all the @FoxNews theories.  Come on Hugh,  if you want to help hold @realDonaldTrump to the high standard you did with our past president.  You give Donald a free sounding board and just don't push back.

941494303439884288 2017-12-14 02:25:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RepAdamSchiff You mean thin skinned, fox loving, media bashing, and going after the justice department @realDonaldTrump could not handle the truth
941493970512875520 2017-12-14 02:23:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @dbongino Only a reasonable person sees how much you lie.  Guess besides your charming looks and personality you got from daddy, you got your stupidity.   Keep watching @FoxNews and it's going to realistically lower your intelligence by 90%
941493260605894656 2017-12-14 02:21:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AC360 The more that @JohnKasich speaks the more I think he is respected.  I wish @realDonaldTrump wasn't such a bully and his ignorant fans didn't see how bad they were going to get hosed.
941492875057160192 2017-12-14 02:19:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr You are hilarious.   Attach the justice department since they have you in their crosshairs.
941439166382034946 2017-12-14 22:46:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @businessinsider Just one flaw with @realDonaldTrump ?   That's a joke like him
941401051361628162 2017-12-14 20:14:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MittRomney Think you could talk to @realDonaldTrump about this?   All our great law agencies all said Russia impeded the election but the @GOP doesn't believe
941400275310571520 2017-12-14 20:11:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @EdKrassen Come on Ohio!!
941397686560935936 2017-12-14 20:01:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @thehill @MichelleSkime Hey @GovMikeHuckabee how can you say this without laughing hysterically?   You are good to defend your daughter, but this is not the right way.
941395618181844994 2017-12-14 19:53:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PhilipRucker @abbydphillip Why so sure @realDonaldTrump ?   I literally believe nothing you say.
941394549846478848 2017-12-14 19:48:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AP Let's go respectable @GOP      Vote no or delay!  How about some scores and actual dry ink on the bill before you vote
941380610077220866 2017-12-14 18:53:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AP Funny that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump will do the opposite of Obama.  I think the world needs to tell trump that Obama did the opposite so we will all be better.  He's not smart enough to research
941379860907397120 2017-12-14 18:50:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JeffFlake Vote no on this Tax bill!   Will help with changing our country from one of @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan to we the people again.
941379514310983680 2017-12-14 18:49:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @FBI @GOP @DustinCarbetta @brianklaas @LarryCleaver @da5650 And @Jim_Jordan was the worst.  He is another that needs to go.  Ohio will join forces to remove him.  He is another @realDonaldTrump and Bannon puppet that is devoid of a individual thought.
941343763825295360 2017-12-14 16:26:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SykesCharlie They follow their supreme leader and can't come up with intelligent thoughts @Jim_Jordan is the leader.
941343431451926529 2017-12-14 16:25:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @businessinsider This is another trump mistake.
941341901021728768 2017-12-14 16:19:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @DLeonhardt Don't worry, @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan and @FoxNews will all say that the verifiable lies are lies and that everyone lies but the lying Fox News.
941334396820508672 2017-12-14 15:49:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AlexNBCNews Can we get @Jim_Jordan to get on this and not seek reelection
941321769880883200 2017-12-14 14:59:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoeBiden I don't always agree with @JohnKasich , but I respect you and your opinions.  I would love others to be as decent as you.  Please try to get on the ticket again and give the country some suitable options.
941305015930621953 2017-12-14 13:52:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr I have to say this is fake, what does suprilngly mean?
941303126539296768 2017-12-14 13:45:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FortuneMagazine Saying and doing are two separate things.
941302554843074561 2017-12-14 13:43:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Don't worry @Jim_Jordan is on it and using malexjonesshows as his credibility.  Nice work @GOP    When the investigations get too close go at the investigators.   Guess you think.... wait, you don't, you have others till you what to think.
941298806326484993 2017-12-14 13:28:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @HuffPost Hopefully they will turn @FoxNews into a news organization and not a @GOP network.
941293278078619648 2017-12-14 13:06:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas I literally can't believe anything from @FoxNews
941170030565347328 2017-12-13 04:56:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @AprilDRyan Please keep up the great work.  Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.
941164369672589313 2017-12-13 04:34:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JayCaruso @CaseyHinds @dallasnews He's a cancer but don't forget @Jim_Jordan and @realDonaldTrump are up there.  Don't forget @SenateMajLdr who suddenly forgot his words from years ago when he was the minority's leader and demanded a fair senate
941162186470248448 2017-12-13 04:25:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PoliticalShort @hughhewitt @JLeposki And @Jim_Jordan going after the judicial system is so irresponsible and so @FoxNews and @realDonaldTrump    Jimmy boy needs to understand that he's not representing Ohio at all.  Jim following the Bannon roadmap
941161343960469504 2017-12-13 04:22:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt @nonsoinbills This is a guy paid by @FoxNews @Jim_Jordan    He loves his theories and trying to discredit our own judicial system is irresponsible.  He's a trump fluffer
941160933459746816 2017-12-13 04:20:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt @woollylamb He's a total disgrace and loves his voice without any facts.  Let's disband the special counsel when it was repeated over and over that mueller hasn't done anything wrong.  What is jimmy boy hiding @Jim_Jordan
941160443615305728 2017-12-13 04:18:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Hey @Jim_Jordan , your conspiracy theory's are just that.  You tried making 1+ 2 = 4 just doesn't work.  Please stop representing Ohio like this and stop embarrassing us.  Heard from several newspapers that you hold zero credibility and should not even be on a condo association
941078651281575937 2017-12-13 22:53:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jeffzeleny @jaketapper Funny he listens to anyone but him since he's the smartest guy ever.   @realDonaldTrump may not be the president, maybe Bannon since that's who he listens too
941073996392607744 2017-12-13 22:34:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WPJohnWagner @PhilipRucker If you were so right @realDonaldTrump and self claimed smartest person, why would you listen to Bannon??   This doesn't make sense.  Are you the @POTUS or is Bannon?   Please help us understand since you are now changing your tune on Moore.
941071548382961665 2017-12-13 22:25:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jimsciutto @genefoxjr @KcNightfire The @GOP needs to get him off every committee and put Bannon on his reelection!   I listened as I drove and you could feel him ready to take a bow after his performance.  @Jim_Jordan is vile and not capable of a unique thought, he follows trumps direction.
941068589196546048 2017-12-13 22:13:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jimsciutto @KcNightfire @genefoxjr He embraced the right wing nut to a tee.  @Jim_Jordan was almost comical and being from Ohio I had to shake my head and just think how can we get this loose cannon out.  His performance was out of line
941011171368493058 2017-12-13 18:25:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @SethAbramson It was apparently party over truth during that hearing.  I listened to some @GOP verbally assault out judicial system.
941003560426393600 2017-12-13 17:55:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> You are not serving the state of Ohio.  You are a self serving trump follower.  The state of Ohio will have to have to get you out.  @Jim_Jordan you choose party over truth and trying to imply other than the truth.
940972374706524163 2017-12-13 15:51:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Not sure who the individual from TX was asking questions, but he didn't sound very intelligent.   He sounded like someone trying to protect trump.
940953610543919104 2017-12-13 14:36:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN @NoFoxnewstoday Not too mention they all were against @realDonaldTrump until they realized he would win.  Bannon and trump are the @GOP until they change.
940953040953270272 2017-12-13 14:34:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN While you are on your soapbox, please work on bannons crazy uncle @realDonaldTrump
940950964537888770 2017-12-13 14:26:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC You are welcome to get an original thought and not be a puppet for trump.  You said trump was a kook and now you praise him and his courses.
940949381234266114 2017-12-13 14:19:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Love how @FoxNews is covering text messages from an FBI regarding the special investigation instead of the major defeat in Alabama.   Plus they are trying to infer what the texts means but ignore the trump text as non sexual.   The @GOP isn't very bright
940941342716366857 2017-12-13 13:47:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ChrisCuomo @brianklaas @mkraju Wish he would say the truth about @realDonaldTrump    Bannon is repulsive but so is trump.
940922788692549632 2017-12-13 12:34:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN He's always right!   What a self indulgent waste.  He lost again, can't get anything done, he's under investigation, and not able to bully his way out.  @realDonaldTrump who sent that congrats last night from your account?
940920270113689600 2017-12-13 12:24:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @hughhewitt Can't happen with an unfocused and undiplomatic and zero discipline at the top.  Should be talking about taxes but instead insults and has more sexual innuendo towards a senator he disagrees with.   2018 will be an interesting election.
940867310654455811 2017-12-13 08:53:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara Even after he lost he is lying.  I heard what the sec of state said, only a state sponsored recount if in .5%.  It's nearly 3x last time I looked.
940798668940161025 2017-12-12 04:20:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump You are a certified moron.  You tried to get your lackey in and lost.  You did everything to discredit this and push your ignorant hateful remarks on the people of Alabama.  Next is flipping the house to impeach you
940797374087290880 2017-12-12 04:15:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @seanhannity You!!
940795645509726208 2017-12-12 04:08:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> The @FCC should stand up for the consumers it represents and protect #NetNeutrality on December 14https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54j487s/546vq
940794580970110977 2017-12-12 04:04:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JeffFlake Please do your best to get @realDonaldTrump out!!   His presence is destroying our country and he has to go.

940627226470551552 2017-12-12 16:59:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Please delete your account.  You literally embarrass yourself with everything you say.   I would say you embarrassed your family but that's a stretch
940427675235176448 2017-12-11 03:46:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @tribelaw Any thoughts @hughhewitt ? You seem to be the voice of Nixon and trump
940423155830665216 2017-12-11 03:28:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @MaxBoot Hey @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr look and research!!  Ignorance is bliss
940413734803116033 2017-12-11 02:51:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @funder Ignorant people who vote on a R will help him.  People with morals and decency will vote for @GDouglasJones
940412457901854720 2017-12-11 02:46:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Hope you never had daughters, if so, I am sorry for them.   As a dad I would go ballistic and use everything this government taught me to destroy the person who hurt my daughter
940407319577419777 2017-12-11 02:25:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @annejowrites @RVAwonk @DougDooganuchi This is the person who feel @realDonaldTrump is their supreme leader. Get a brain people watching @FoxNews
940406254916243457 2017-12-11 02:21:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chicagotribune If you say @realDonaldTrump and let @seanhannity know that this gets them a vote, @FoxNews will run with it.  Headline "trump trumps little missile boy to the snow report"
940405391103549441 2017-12-11 02:18:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @funder Hope he never had daughters, if so, I am sorry for them.   As a dad I would go ballistic and use everything this government taught me to destroy the person who hurt my daughter
940404896452567040 2017-12-11 02:16:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt I respected you when my parents told stories about how you helped them in high school.  They always spoke highly of you.   Well.... you lost them with your blind devotion to @realDonaldTrump     Thought you had enough of @GOP corruption running the @NixonLibrary
940403868730523649 2017-12-11 02:12:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FiveRights Hope you never had daughters, if so, I am sorry for them.   As a dad I would go ballistic and use everything this government taught me to destroy the person who hurt my daughter
940392415780900864 2017-12-11 01:26:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN The irony is that this wasn't held at a high school.
940391808755994624 2017-12-11 01:24:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Make it snow in Alabama!!!
940387206006476800 2017-12-11 01:05:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BiglyIfTrue Yep.  Thanks for calling me out
940386755076939776 2017-12-11 01:04:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN @BiglyIfTrue So since he owned it he owned the ladies??? She clearly said that no men were allowed in the dress room.  Your supreme leader @realDonaldTrump said on Howard stern he would do this.    So, asking for a friend, if this was a jr miss American would it still be ok?
940385501638426629 2017-12-11 00:59:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @ShaunKing Please don't ever think that @seanhannity is capable of the truth.  Plus the @GOP love their supreme leader @realDonaldTrump    They blindly follow and believe him, too bad they don't see he's not wearing any clothes (they won't get the reference)
940383289977790464 2017-12-11 00:50:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @marriop999 I never got one from you.  Guess you can't honor your decorated veteran.   I didn't fight for a person like trump to set us back.    I hope your disability allows you a quality of life.
940381042107715589 2017-12-11 00:41:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LacyClayMO1 @marriop999 Stolen valor?!?   How about an apology
940376155533774848 2017-12-11 00:22:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LacyClayMO1 Funny that the biggest trump follower to his supreme leader thinks this is all fake.  So..  how can this be true @marriop999 ???pic.twitter.com/FZgJe4cY3Y
940369055889940480 2017-12-11 23:53:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @elisefoley I'm positive the @realDonaldTrump and @DonaldJTrumpJr don't care about the truth.  In fact, his followers are like the Manson clan, loyalty devotion
940366847408472066 2017-12-11 23:45:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> .@FoxNews do you ever say anything critical of @realDonaldTrump ?   Based on your tweets it's a no.
940357883337768961 2017-12-11 23:09:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @axios His followers love their supreme leader in @realDonaldTrump    Shame they have no brain
940340967743377408 2017-12-11 22:02:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @yashar Explain your dad @realDonaldTrump !!
940271762394222592 2017-12-11 17:27:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JohnJHarwood Don't believe this.  @FoxNews will say this to keep the dems from voting.   Get out and vote!!   Remember they love their supreme leader in @realDonaldTrump and will do / say what he wants them too.
940268178688630786 2017-12-11 17:12:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MatureTrumpTwts Oh how it would be so refreshing to actually hearing his words sound like this.
940267645869481984 2017-12-11 17:10:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FiveRights You believe the ladies who accuse mario but not the 17 who did trump?   Plus the tapes of his sexual prowess; Howard stern shows; ex wife testimony; and his own words!   Thanks for the perspective
940250190358904838 2017-12-11 16:01:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @krassenstein If you have a ability to think, you know that @FoxNews is a state paper for @realDonaldTrump    But his followers only listen to what they want too.
940246457587781632 2017-12-11 15:46:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> How many do you need till to come forward you say something about trump @redsteeze.  What's he at, 17 and let's not include all the beauty pageants he just walked in on.
940224882071261189 2017-12-11 14:20:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Whatever it takes to keep Roy Moore out is best for our country.  Don't need another sexual predator and trump henchman in congress.
940068023808925700 2017-12-10 03:57:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @businessinsider @marriop999 Nice.  Hope you can sell them both for a profit.  I know how to do proper research and verify facts, you may want to.  But... I am one who enjoys free speech since I fought for you to say what you like.
940044213873360896 2017-12-10 02:23:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @businessinsider The @GOP has hit the all time low with @realDonaldTrump at the helm.  Nice work!
939589121957421056 2017-12-09 20:14:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr They won't serve that in prison.
939588811943706625 2017-12-09 20:13:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman You sound too much like your supreme leader @realDonaldTrump.  How about a unique thought out of your mind.
939137770156683265 2017-12-08 14:21:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Oh.  I think we should totally just believe him since he is so honest @realDonaldTrump
938841147539062785 2017-12-07 18:42:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @alfranken @hughhewitt So since he resigned, when can we expect Roy and @realDonaldTrump to resign?   I am not concerned about the apology as you, his actions were right.  Now is time for the  @GOP to eliminate their sexual predators
938220831276261385 2017-12-05 01:37:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @NLebedevaNBC @KenDilanianNBC @MarkKornblau @carolelee I would love to see @DonaldJTrumpJr beg for daddy's forgiveness while he is in office. Hopefully before jr pees his pants
938217111855554561 2017-12-05 01:22:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SteveBannen You drunk
938216980817072128 2017-12-05 01:22:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Funny how anyone would trust @SteveBannen    This is an anti American who is so self serving
938201796568338432 2017-12-05 00:21:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Im with @GDouglasJones on this!!  We have one predator in office
938199915934769154 2017-12-05 00:14:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Keep bringing it @GDouglasJones !!
938189818856689665 2017-12-05 23:34:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @KRolfe25 Come on Alabama!!!   This man will honorable represent you!!
938187443324571648 2017-12-05 23:24:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Vote for @GDouglasJones !!!! Let's start making our country honorable again.
938187217113108481 2017-12-05 23:23:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Love this.  Funny how @realDonaldTrump was praising the loyalty of his party as this was going on.
938171643867926528 2017-12-05 22:22:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost This bill is far from passed.  With the changes they promised to a couple senators that they backtracked on i can see this dying again.  Add all the distractions from @realDonaldTrump it's not done.
938165194735353857 2017-12-05 21:56:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Love that we still have people who want to preserve our land and the beauty it brings.  Oil / gas aren't as important as preserving
938059122729259008 2017-12-05 14:54:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jimsciutto Get our and vote for @GDouglasJones and add some morality to our country
938038290535649280 2017-12-05 13:32:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SteeIerNation Great news!!   Get healthy and speedy recovery
937899444124700672 2017-12-04 04:20:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AP So this is YOUR party @hughhewitt    I think you need to talk about this on your show tomorrow!   Supporting him sends a dangerous message
937869147031076869 2017-12-04 02:20:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RyanShazier @mortreport @ZMiller86 Nothing new yet!    for you!
937866445639299073 2017-12-04 02:09:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @KirkHerbstreit Kirk I would say that you objective when it comes to osu football.   I would have loved to see the bucks in the playoff.  But the @BlueJacketsNHL will bring out the homers in all the cbus natives!!!
937845244393029632 2017-12-04 00:45:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper @StephenGutowski Wow!!  Just wow.
937839306403667968 2017-12-04 00:21:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt @jpodhoretz @BiglyIfTrue Yep.  You are right.

937837853475786755 2017-12-04 00:15:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt @jpodhoretz @BiglyIfTrue I have medals and certificates.  Im positive you don't.  Love how you let your ignorance get in the way of your thoughts.   Try again.  Try pulling on your head till it pops out of your ass.

937835075496038400 2017-12-04 00:04:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt @jpodhoretz @BiglyIfTrue Funny person.  I served honorably and was decorated.  I stand for decency and war avoidance.  But everyone lies is a total @realDonaldTrump defense.   You must pray to your supreme leader every night and have blind devotion
937831766836088833 2017-12-04 23:51:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt Just denounce the pedophile you will  have on your side.  Plus you keep saying investigate the dems but don't seem to care that your supreme leader colluded with the Russians.   This is absolutely absurd
937831005226000384 2017-12-04 23:48:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt @jpodhoretz @BiglyIfTrue Honest question: do you not care about all the lies that @realDonaldTrump says or do you just not care?  Or are you so right wing that you choose party of morality?
937828204542349312 2017-12-04 23:37:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MikeDeWine @MaryTaylorOH @JimRenacci @HenryJGomez @hughhewitt @SalenaZito Hugh, still blindly following @realDonaldTrump?   As a catholic I would think you would be appalled at his actions.  His supporting @MooreSenate is disgusting.  I wish someone who has your audience would denounce this for our country.  I put my life for the USA and expect more
937827305422049283 2017-12-04 23:33:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost @maureen14156319 @manaskunt It's a fun question to ask his followers though. They see him as their god and it's blindly ignorant.

937778762493714439 2017-12-04 20:20:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @funder @saxenmeyer Get out and vote for Doug Jones!
937766350759649280 2017-12-04 19:31:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Honest question: does the @GOP not care about all the lies that @realDonaldTrump says or do you just not care? are you so right wing that you choose party of morality?   Maybe @hughhewitt can shed some light on this?  Plus when does the GOP get appalled by his words / actions

937677911888482304 2017-12-04 13:40:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytpolitics The citizens of AL will have all eyes on them.  Do they vote party or on morals.  I hope they do the right thing and start to show that your party @GOP isn't all @realDonaldTrump
937676065862021120 2017-12-04 13:32:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PhilipRucker @kaitlancollins Since she's incredibly honest I totally believe this!!
937673908148371457 2017-12-04 13:24:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @freeRwe @schwanderer @DrJFSR Jump in please.  I love other opinions with educated people.
937673553532653568 2017-12-04 13:22:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY This is the time when everyone in the @GOP denounces this endorsement!   @hughhewitt I think this is bigger than a party issue, how could the country take the GOP serious with this predator in senate.  @SenateMajLdr won't do anything
937562766042419203 2017-12-03 06:02:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> You are a total scam artist and spineless @SenateMajLdr  McConnell on sexual misconduct allegations against Trump: I only have jurisdiction in Senatehttp://thehill.com/homenews/senate/363016-mcconnell-on-trump-accusations-i-only-have-jurisdiction-in-the-senate
937555761911271425 2017-12-03 05:34:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @freeRwe @schwanderer @DrJFSR Cool.  How does this have any impact on this conversation.  Thanks for serving too.
937423442885963776 2017-12-03 20:48:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Can't Love the hate ignorant behavior from @realDonaldTrump and December political cartoons from the USA TODAY Network https://usat.ly/2BBjfbf via @USATODAY
937422951019896833 2017-12-03 20:47:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> December political cartoons from the USA TODAY Network https://usat.ly/2BBjfbf via @USATODAY
937137490409947137 2017-12-02 01:52:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr I loved NYC saying lock him up.   Can't wait for you and your family to go down.
937101191871389696 2017-12-02 23:28:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @thehill Merry Christmas @realDonaldTrump !!!   Impeachment is coming.   Can't wait to see @DonaldJTrumpJr crying over daddy going to jail.
937096015978684416 2017-12-02 23:07:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Looking forward to voting you out.  Don't claim the buckeyes you traitor
937036226816827393 2017-12-02 19:10:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WSJ Let's see what Mueller's team has to say.  I think it's the beginning of the end for @realDonaldTrump !!!  And I'll gladly say merry Christmas like @BarackObama did every year you cumquat.
937035688620576770 2017-12-02 19:08:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @rachaelmbade @Fahrenthold @politico Because they are increasingly more hypocritical every day.
937010967380152320 2017-12-02 17:29:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @MeMilo Hey @JacobAWohl look!!   It's not a party issue, it's a country issue.  It's clear you never served in the military , we choose country before self you self serving little man.
937010515875856388 2017-12-02 17:28:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JacobAWohl You are a total on your knees for your supreme leader @realDonaldTrump
937010282743910400 2017-12-02 17:27:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Lock @realDonaldTrump up!!
937008574424854528 2017-12-02 17:20:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Hmmmm.   The CBO says otherwise.  Love how you pick and choose when to consult the CBO.   Plus it was done without @realDonaldTrump tax return.  What's wrong with you!!!!  How much does this affect your bottom line?!?   Please answer @senrobportman
936973587411501061 2017-12-02 15:01:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas This is a total lie.  @LindseyGrahamSC @SenateMajLdr @senrobportman are all doing what the money who supports them to do.  Plus they divided our country even more.  This bill helps me personally, but what I learned in the military is service before self, too bad they didn't.
936965573153624064 2017-12-02 14:29:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman If that's what helps you sleep at night.  Personally I think you just got to keep a ton of money since you are one of the more wealthy senators.   The fact you were spineless and didn't force your supreme leader @realDonaldTrump to expose his taxes is comical
936795995576217600 2017-12-01 03:15:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SykesCharlie @ddale8 . @FoxNews followers are not that wise to ever do any research
936744435181916165 2017-12-01 23:50:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JohnJHarwood This is before the Flynn flip!
936744222413160448 2017-12-01 23:50:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman How about stop everything until the system sees how far trump was involved.  Everyone knows you stalled everything Obama did with the Supreme Court.
936743943613616128 2017-12-01 23:48:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Trying to use politics after due process is ignorant and dangerous.   You are going to prison too.
936724760645570561 2017-12-01 22:32:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @freeRwe @schwanderer @sun_shine1095 Bravo for that input.
936714330682351617 2017-12-01 21:51:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenatorTimScott Donnie you may want to focus on family.  It's going to be great to see you go down in a blaze of glory.
936710664369917952 2017-12-01 21:36:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SecretaryZinke @POTUS Hey.  How's the day with all the news?!
936710085019160577 2017-12-01 21:34:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @PressSec So why the urgency to redo the tax code?   Something that will benefit the @realDonaldTrump
936701319712329729 2017-12-01 20:59:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @freeRwe @schwanderer @What_If_Only The wall will not change anything.  Keep in mind you are having a conversation with a vet who has fought and lost friends / family. Due process isn't dumb. It's the American way and what I fought for.  So you are welcome to say what you want, but know the facts please
936694484913606656 2017-12-01 20:32:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @freeRwe @schwanderer @What_If_Only That's a separate discussion. Talk one point at a time.  Due process on why he was acquitted. Why he was here is another subject.  Don't confuse issues.
936694075528568834 2017-12-01 20:30:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @oufenix Dont argue with his base.  They are mindless bots for their supreme leader @realDonaldTrump and listen to anything that dangerously lying tucker says.
936693505409343488 2017-12-01 20:28:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @doberacker Juries are agree upon by both sides of the prosecution and defense.  Please learn our judicial system.
936693290627420161 2017-12-01 20:27:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @RealEagleBites Juries are agree upon by both sides of the prosecution and defense.  Please learn our judicial system.
936692730251628545 2017-12-01 20:25:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @freeRwe @schwanderer @What_If_Only So you are arguing against the constitution and due process.  Nice.  Plus realize the just is agreed upon both sides!   It's not a right or left, it's our system.
936692320912728065 2017-12-01 20:23:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @schwanderer @freeRwe This is not true.
936692172186845184 2017-12-01 20:23:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @freeRwe @schwanderer Please don't expect a trump supporter to know the constitution.
936692057669857280 2017-12-01 20:22:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews @DonaldJTrumpJr @TuckerCarlson Love your spin with a total fabrication of the truth tucker.  Ps.  Illigal immigrant can't be on a jury.  I would expect a trump supporter to know that 
936690764503027712 2017-12-01 20:17:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GloriaBorger @brianstelter Including @realDonaldTrump
936689220390965248 2017-12-01 20:11:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt So all focus on Flynn means the @GOP will jam this bill through. High- you know if this was a dem you would say halt everything.  Just like the Supreme Court justice vote.  How hypocritical are you?!?
936680272715767808 2017-12-01 19:35:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @tedlieu @Redpainter1 @poetry4justice Oh I'm hoping for @DonaldJTrumpJr is next.  Then Roger Stone!!!
936680020394770433 2017-12-01 19:34:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @CJCiano_Collins @tedlieu Trump will turn on his family to save himself.  Man has no morals.  At the Christmas with the trumps I would play apprentice behind his back and create your own alliances to save yourself.  @realDonaldTrump will go down with or without you.
936679129667309568 2017-12-01 19:31:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump I got a new name for JRs book.  My love with Russia to get daddy's approval.  I think you can write it while in prison.
936664482373361665 2017-12-01 18:33:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytpolitics @GardinerHarris He may want to resign first.
936663863986188288 2017-12-01 18:30:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> I'm happy to be saying merry Christmas just like @BarackObama did all these years.  I'll really be merry this Christmas if @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr are under Mueller's pressure and can't say merry Christmas since they are shaking in their boots!!
936661024694046720 2017-12-01 18:19:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JuddApatow Hey @LindseyGrahamSC this didn't age well.  But we do agree that @realDonaldTrump is a kook along with his classless son @DonaldJTrumpJr
936658566886445061 2017-12-01 18:09:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas Totally agree.  This is getting a little out of control.
936642782994853888 2017-12-01 17:06:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chucktodd How they can move forward with no finished bill and no final cbo score is crazy.  But @SenateMajLdr is not the best of leaders.
936638719620153344 2017-12-01 16:50:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Hey.  Maybe you should request @realDonaldTrump tax return before you potentially give him more money.  Also you should stop all this to see if your supreme leader is impeached
936635174665838592 2017-12-01 16:36:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas Brian, what will @realDonaldTrump say about this in your opinion?
936632898530299905 2017-12-01 16:27:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AP Can't wait to see what @realDonaldTrump and @DonaldJTrumpJr say about this.  Hope that we don't remember him and he only had a small part isn't a part of the defense.
936632411093336066 2017-12-01 16:25:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara Hey @DonaldJTrumpJr what's your thoughts now on due process?  Is that a left or right thing?   Guess you only care about it when you need it the most!!!   The country is laughing at you, not with you.
936592653524918274 2017-12-01 13:47:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WSJ @hughhewitt @Peggynoonannyc He will only bring in the best.  What's going on with the best leaving?   Are they not following everything he is requesting even if it's illegal?   This is a joke of a president who is losing his grip on reality and continues to lie.  But the @GOP supports him
936573493617004544 2017-12-01 12:31:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes Just a tad off!?   They will still pass it
936557218572460032 2017-12-01 11:26:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Jr- you will learn soon.   As for everyone saying build a wall and liberals, learn how our judicial system works please.  This isn't a party decision, it's from a jury that BOTH the prosecution and defendant choose.  Education is lacking with some of your uneducated opinions
936417403600334849 2017-11-30 02:11:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt @BrianRHarris They aren't and only placate to their donors and their supreme leader @realDonaldTrump who will benefit bigly from it.  It's a sham and don't forget they added addition drilling in the artic for their oil friends.
936404120302444544 2017-11-30 01:18:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @bigjoe467 @Azile00 Please don't bring facts and proof to his followers.  When @realDonaldTrump says trust me or believe me, they do.  research certainly not necessary when you blindly trust their supreme leader like they do.
936387318977581056 2017-11-30 00:11:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @KirkHerbstreit Kenny Chesney
936386928353730561 2017-11-30 00:10:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY Wasn't that the whole point.
936369406472523776 2017-11-30 23:00:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SykesCharlie @joshtpm Hey @LindseyGrahamSC how quick you flip to get what you want for a win.  But the whole @GOP condones his kook behavior and we all think @realDonaldTrump is crazy.
936320726310817793 2017-11-30 19:47:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @dannykanell Tn should just ask @ClayTravis who he wants to coach.  He seems to be the supreme leader for TN football.
936303827669659648 2017-11-30 18:40:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SpeakerRyan @senrobportman @realDonaldTrump @theresa_may @PhilipRucker @SkyNews @SweetHoneyBeast More people died in the Vegas shooting by a non Muslim than all the attacks in Europe.  Sweet honey please bring facts!!! Plus it's every right for other world leaders to condemn racist tweets from another country. Literally can't have a legit conversation with you
936280443602784256 2017-11-30 17:07:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> We all know that the @GOP only cares about their agenda.   @senrobportman @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump are all jokes.  Say a dem should immediately but support trump and Moore.  So backwards.   If a GOP voice @hughhewitt would step up for human decency that would be a starthttps://twitter.com/rissa020808/status/936279151295811584
936278858390786054 2017-11-30 17:00:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @NBCNews Hey @hughhewitt how can the @GOP say this with a straight face when you are all supporting Roy Moore and never once pressed @realDonaldTrump to resign.  This is beyond insane and how the @GOP will do anything for its donors.   You want to be taken seriously then condemn trump
936278201189457927 2017-11-30 16:58:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @AlexNBCNews Wait.  @SpeakerRyan you say this but totally ignore the 14+ against @realDonaldTrump and still haven't condemned Roy Moore.  How do you sleep
936276351023304706 2017-11-30 16:50:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @MotherJones At least we won't see her on tv as much.
936253012720406528 2017-11-30 15:18:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SenToomey @hughhewitt I suggest that the @GOP and @SenateDems start cross interviews on the other networks.  The CBO says it will kill the middle class.  The @GOP can't pick and choose when to use the CBO to their advantage
936252635258204165 2017-11-30 15:16:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SenToomey @hughhewitt you are from a blue collar town in Ohio that this will kill.  You have to know that this tax cut will ultimately affect all the middle class.  When the govt runs out of money, where will it come from,  SS and Medicaid.  Can't brag how great the market is and then demand a cut.
936249956029140992 2017-11-30 15:05:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt I'm curious Hugh, how much money will this new tax bill save you?   I'll save a lot, but it's not about me, it's about our country.
936241701684940800 2017-11-30 14:33:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jemelehill @GolicAndWingo Come on @espngolic!!!!   Take that plung.
936239765237698561 2017-11-30 14:25:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RealAlexJones What a total false story.  How Can anyone believe what he says.  Alex Jones: Vegas Coverup Collapsing  Sheriff May Be In Danger http://www.infowars.com/watch-vegas-coverup-collapsing-sheriff-may-be-in-danger/ via @realalexjones
936232244137652224 2017-11-30 13:55:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Come on @espngolic make a bet please.  You have to start the @GolicAndWingo show off right!   @RebeccaLobo keep pressing him please!!   We need your help @MGolicJR57 pushing dad
936231168042831874 2017-11-30 13:51:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @theresa_may @PhilipRucker @SkyNews Love her leadership on this.  Watch how leaders are @realDonaldTrump @senrobportman @SpeakerRyan
936230760322920448 2017-11-30 13:49:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas It is sad but worse because his party just wants to undo the past 8 years at any cost.  Until the @GOP @SpeakerRyan @senrobportman actually gets a spine this will keep going until all human decency is lost.
936229558046650369 2017-11-30 13:44:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @EdKrassen Only the @GOP is fine with this.
936055498423586816 2017-11-29 02:13:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Cardale7_  I would love for you to one day put my cousin on your cleats   sgt Brandon bury who died on 6/6/10 on his 3rd tour.https://poe.house.gov/2010/6/united-states-marine-sergeant-brandon-bury
936046398281322498 2017-11-29 01:37:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt Then how can he claim that the economy is at a all time high?   Where is the lie then?   You are turning into another "follower" of @realDonaldTrump    Sad state of affairs
936029774849462275 2017-11-29 00:31:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @HuffPost Follow the @seanhannity feed@ and you will see how they are getting spoon fed lies and theories and his "followers" believe everything.  Or follow the @FoxNews to see the lies they spew.  Plus every @GOP only uses fox for a reason.   Lies and playing to their base.
936028957354405888 2017-11-29 00:27:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @HuffPost He lies, they accept it.  No shock anymore.  Will take decades to repair his damage.  Unless Mueller hurries to save our union.
936027549674729473 2017-11-29 00:22:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @RebeccaLobo @espngolic Come on golic!!  Eat something crazy that's not hot.  Like grubs or something
936025444108984326 2017-11-29 00:13:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> If the @GOP really wants to reach everybody, don't just do @FoxNews interviews.   Only a portion of the citizens watches the alt right news network.  Also get off @seanhannity since he isn't a news person but an opinion show.
935988414872158208 2017-11-29 21:46:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Yet you support Roy Moore and @POTUS    So what should we really believe since you are literally on both sides of this conversation
935987882824814593 2017-11-29 21:44:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Are you doing anything but going on @FoxNews and spreading your savior lies?   Everyone wants to protect women and children and is common sense and should be an easy bill pass.
935979794973577216 2017-11-29 21:12:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Please stop covering him.  He's just smoke screening us from his vial acts.
935975788826054656 2017-11-29 20:56:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman @michaelleves Watch this if you are not wealthy and support the new tax bill.   Guess the CBO doesn't hold any credit and @senorrinhatch is way smarter than all the experts. The @GOP is spitefully loyal to their savior @realDonaldTrump
935974153370390529 2017-11-29 20:50:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Explain this @senrobportman please!   As an investor I promise I'll keep my extra money and invest.  Won't spend it and you will help bridge the gap between the classes.  Trump's Tax Promises Undercut by CEO Plans to Help Investors https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2017-11-29/trump-s-tax-promises-undercut-by-ceo-plans-to-reward-investors
935973438879141888 2017-11-29 20:47:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman If this is all true then how can @POTUS claim the economy is at an all time high and all the other economic experts say it will destroy the middle.
935958117682221056 2017-11-29 19:46:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> The @senrobportman @GOP needs to stop and take a step back to see what's in @realDonaldTrump tax returns.  How can you not demand this and see why he is so adamant and pushing this forward.  Maybe he's just self serving for this tax cut for the rich.  You are an embarrassment
935957010302021633 2017-11-29 19:41:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @davidaxelrod It doesn't.  His cult doesn't care and @senrobportman @SpeakerRyan won't stand up.  So it's getting useless trying to talk to his "followers".  They think he's more trusted than all the government agencies.
935954958683385859 2017-11-29 19:33:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Just heard the funniest commercial on @ESPNRadio for @realDonaldTrump golf courses.  Next will be selling coupons since he's losing business with his hate mongering.  Wish ESPN would stand up to the hate and bigotry and remove his advertising
935942153758564353 2017-11-29 18:42:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Bravo @senrobportman @PressSec @GOP @SpeakerRyan and the rest who defend him.  Im glad I put my life on the line when I served for you to be such cowards.  Honestly expected more from our leaders
935941609593757700 2017-11-29 18:40:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @CaseyHinds @davidaxelrod It is a waste to even say anything anymore.  His "followers " don't care and would literally believe him over Jesus.  The @GOP honestly needs to think about the country than their party.
935863873378414592 2017-11-29 13:31:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas The @GOP needs to step up!!!   @SpeakerRyan you are obligated to step in.  If you whiteness a crime/ psychological issues and don't try to intervene you become complicit.   The @realDonaldTrump isn't acting in good faith for our country.
935854567044116481 2017-11-29 12:54:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas Only in America can we wake up to this crazy information.   @realDonaldTrump seems to just want to ignite the mob and for what reason??? Do they want another civil war?
935853762341756928 2017-11-29 12:51:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper The problem is no one in Congress who can actually do anything cares more about policy and getting what they want.  If anyone in the @GOP had a spine they would stand up and say this has to end.
935707512657104898 2017-11-28 03:10:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Lies and more lies.  @tedcruz is just another reason why the @GOP clearly caters to the rich and corporation
935600064520753154 2017-11-28 20:03:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @byelin Our senator @senrobportman won't answer the phones or talk to his Ohio citizens.  So... it's going to be a shitty day for people not in the 1% real quick.  3 years the country needs to unite to get this @realDonaldTrump out of office if of course we didn't have a nuclear war
935596174937133057 2017-11-28 19:48:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman @boss_kettering He is!   5 years will be here quickly.
935595988064063489 2017-11-28 19:47:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman Nope, not true.  The rich will keep that extra money and invest in themselves, not spend more.  I know this for a fact.
935595753560596482 2017-11-28 19:46:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper @ScottPollak I agree that his premise was to come up with fake accounts so they can then discredit the real sources.   But, he was trying to use the victims as a method to try and discredit them, that's my problem.  Using real victims as bait.
935593967672090624 2017-11-28 19:39:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @LennyGhoul It needs to end with people standing up to him.  His only retort is to try and offend you and name call... back to your 4 year old comment.
935593421217173504 2017-11-28 19:37:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper @ScottPollak The WA post verfied its authenticity and deemed it unreliable.  How can you keep saying they are lacking integrity.   the @washingtonpost clearly demonstrated this.   So you think it's cool to fake rape so you can discredit the other victims?   Please help me understand
935583871361482753 2017-11-28 18:59:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper @ScottPollak Asking woman to fake sexual assault and coerced abortion allegations for the purpose of exposing media bias in an effort to disprove the truths of the real victims and elect a child molester to the U.S. Senate. Doesn't get much worse.
935581719629099008 2017-11-28 18:50:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Spend time with your family.   You will need it since you will be guilty of treason you treasonous JA.  Grow up too, I would say you are an embarrassment to your family but there are too many that are equally as ridiculous as you.
935571021859577856 2017-11-28 18:08:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CBSThisMorning @senrobportman @LSuds614 I assure you that the tax that the rich get would not be invested in new products or services, it would be invested and let grow.
935544934513463296 2017-11-28 16:24:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CaseyHinds @mmurraypolitics Please stop bringing facts to a @GOP debate.  Leader trump says believe me so they do.  I'm going to benefit but still fighting for the ones who won't!!
935532127738912772 2017-11-28 15:33:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Come On @GOP  you will kill the middle class.  Senators Scramble to Advance Tax Bill That Increasingly Rewards Wealthy - The New York Timeshttps://apple.news/AWbh7r1Y2TKqlab3Pwl0CEA
935503341441908736 2017-11-28 13:39:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DanWetzel I absolutely love this. I was embarrassed for the state of TN who did this.  @KirkHerbstreit @ESPNBooger @stephenasmith thanks for your passionate support for coach.
935502342748811264 2017-11-28 13:35:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JeffFlake @BobCorker @SenatorLankford @RonJohnsonWI @hughhewitt If @realDonaldTrump says corporations are at an all time high, why the need for additional cuts?   Seems like it's talking out of both sides of the @GOP mouth
935500967323361280 2017-11-28 13:29:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @AP @Fahrenthold Maybe this is why they need these ridiculous tax cuts for corporation and rich people.  He thought being president would help his bottom line.
935498591300354048 2017-11-28 13:20:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @maggieNYT @AC360 @jaketapper @brianstelter Why the locker room talk comment then?   I'm doing something crazy here, but could he maybe lying? 
935493293458280448 2017-11-28 12:59:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @molratty It's all about "winning" at all cost.  Plus they have no moral compass.  This came from @realDonaldTrump    You elect a clown expect a circus
935492393771720705 2017-11-28 12:55:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper What they will do to discredit sexual assault victims is just repulsive.  This issue of smoke screens and fake stories starts at the top with @realDonaldTrump
935331813249179648 2017-11-27 02:17:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes Nice work @GOP @realDonaldTrump you are officially garbage / trying to improperly discredit the real media and not the fake media @FoxNews
935300153317167105 2017-11-27 00:11:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @senrobportman @LSuds614 Keep in mind that our lovely senator is a very wealthy man.  He's putting more in his pockets and @realDonaldTrump pockets so they have a win!   They are trying to subconscious destroy this amazing country I fought for.
935292745320751105 2017-11-27 23:42:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost This is just deplorable!   @GOP needs to fix the issues they started.  Having your policy over decent human behavior is more important!
935292332764811264 2017-11-27 23:40:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @FoxNews @senrobportman You are literally not listening!!   You can do this since you just won your reelection and you will benefit from this tax break since you are a 1%er.
935273716648431618 2017-11-27 22:26:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GolicAndWingo @ESPNBooger Booger I totally agree with you on this total character assignation.   I'ts been proven over and over that the hearsay from the one coach was false.   I loved your thoughts and passion on the topic and defending him.
935267883113943040 2017-11-27 22:03:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CillizzaCNN @CNN Then why did they say it was locker room talk?!?   Could it be that @realDonaldTrump is lying!?!?!?   What!!!! He's so ethical and honorable.
935260531564392448 2017-11-27 21:34:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes Beyond an embarrassment to our country.  Funny how @realDonaldTrump can say what he wants then @PressSec will say he didn't mean that.   Glad I didn't sell my soul to the devil like all the @GOP

933908320485888000 2017-11-23 04:01:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @HuffPost @agent18209 That suit was tailored perfectly.  The cuff is 1/2 inch below the shirt; shoulders are cut to his build; and the stripes are going in the right direction.  I totally disagree and think you own zero custom suites with your comments
933906495242211328 2017-11-23 03:53:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN @Twitchypoo1 .@sp1r1tharambe is a fraud or not

933895808881168384 2017-11-23 03:11:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN @sp1r1tharambe So you are equating basic human rights to abortion?   Hang on for this, maybe in China basic rights are voting; free speech; and the right to your religion.
933894220926148608 2017-11-23 03:05:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chicagotribune Guess that's all he has.  @DonaldJTrumpJr will face the issue to turn on daddy @realDonaldTrump or go to prison.  It's severance pay for all the people that screwed over
933893730746200065 2017-11-23 03:03:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @The_UnSilent_ @twistedmic24 Ask @DonaldJTrumpJr how he really felt about his dad after the divorce.  It was pretty clear that @realDonaldTrump took advantage of his mom and jr was pissed.  Ask his college friends
933892373884620800 2017-11-23 02:57:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN @sp1r1tharambe Human rights?   Really??? That's a left thing?   I  you are a bot.
933878185699180544 2017-11-23 02:01:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FoxNews I'm a veteran and literally fought for anyone to have that right.  You are beyond ignorant on what this country is based on.  Kneeling isn't disrespectful of the flag.  The ignorance is @seanhannity not seeing why they are kneeling and taking this opinion as fact.

932443786432667648 2017-11-19 03:01:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @cdkulik Guess @GOP want the philosophy like the current president "just trust me". I don't believe it!  Show us before you vote isn't an unfair request.   But party lines makes @senrobportman cave.
932399009976774658 2017-11-19 00:03:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @the_peej @Realrclark25 Ignore this clown.   Im a Cleveland fan and have respect for your play and opinion.  Look at his profile and sit back and laugh.
932392766096723969 2017-11-19 23:38:53 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @senrobportman Could you be more tone deaf?   You push for opioid funding to slow it down at the same time pulling insurance from the same people that voted you in.   Sounds like you are just another @gop who votes party over your people.
932373687562588161 2017-11-19 22:23:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @nytpolitics This is not a denial, just digging in the sand.  They are preparing for @gop voters in AL to pick a sexual predator over a democrat.   I hope AL can pick based on morality and not party.  We don't need another predator in DC from any party.
932372536599482369 2017-11-19 22:18:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @msuster We all know that @seanhannity lacks all morality and common sense.  But with our great country he is entitled to spew his "lies" as opinions and his gullible followers believe everything he says.   Her response was right on!
932366551017238528 2017-11-19 21:54:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @senrobportman This is a total lie.  How come every financial review says it will lower taxes for the rich; corporations and raise for middle??   I'm confused and would love to see where the @gop actually lays out the bill.
932315173762883584 2017-11-19 18:30:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper Hey @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr this isn't how real leaders act.  This was a citizen of our country.  Who cares if you get "credit".  Act like a real leader please!!
932258154817171457 2017-11-19 14:43:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper This is a disgrace to try and camouflage the issue at hand, Moore is a predator.  Don't try to use smoking mirrors to change the topic.  Still a @GOP would rather have a predatory senator than a democrat.
931882896985554944 2017-11-18 13:52:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CillizzaCNN @CNN Yet no one cares and his "followers " remain committed even though he is directly hurting them the most.  But he won't take their guns so they are great with him!
931669206038401025 2017-11-17 23:43:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoeNBC But the ones getting the worst are the ones who support the ones who and blindly pushing this and support them explicitly.
931602826295472130 2017-11-17 19:19:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Espngreeny Will certainly miss you two each morning.  Hoping you two remain friends.
930554031822589958 2017-11-14 21:52:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Jfeagles @espngolic @NDmom Oh this will be brutal.  Worse than any Osu lost bet!   Go bucks
930553266055929856 2017-11-14 21:49:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SecretaryZinke You and @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr are all useless.  Hunt to eat, not for game.  Waste of money and pride killing animals not for food
930531211629551616 2017-11-14 20:21:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @IvankaTrump @TinaMorphis @yashar @bunnyhugger75 They @gop chooses pedophiles over domocrates.   Figure that out!!  Guess they don't serve the people, just themselves
930526075574276097 2017-11-14 20:01:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ReutersTV @Reuters Wait, what, @realDonaldTrump was lying?  No way!!! He wouldn't even know how to lie.   And he won't be a golfing president.
930519466538164226 2017-11-14 19:35:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper You are a disgusting human.  If that was my daughter you would know what AL justice is all about!!   Go away you pathetic pervert.  But you love @realDonaldTrump and scum like him.
930517078104268800 2017-11-14 19:25:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GOP @CNN It doesn't matter to the @gop and @realDonaldTrump that sessions lies.  The gop would rather have a pedophil; lying pos than any Democratic nomination.  How messed up are we as a country
930425887845158914 2017-11-14 13:23:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @businessinsider He's a moron who is trying to use smoking mirrors.   @DonaldJTrumpJr is trying to fool everyone and it's funny to watch.  Like before, the real story will come out
930425418196443137 2017-11-14 13:21:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @espngolic @NDmom I will miss the show greatly.  They were with me every morning.  My daughter grew up laughing with the show and we are sad to see it end.
930230332082806784 2017-11-13 00:26:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @KeithOlbermann @jillwow He was taken off the bench for violating federal law.https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/10/12/politics/kfile-roy-moore-nullification/index.html
930229788937203713 2017-11-13 00:23:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @KeithOlbermann Guess it's the @GOP way to fully accept sexual predators like @realDonaldTrump and fools like @seanhannity to fully endorse them.   But these ignorant people choose sexual predators over a @SenateDems
930228361988857857 2017-11-13 00:18:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> You make it so easy to hate you!https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/930071572349636609
930228118572470272 2017-11-13 00:17:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @juliaioffe @Mister_Fun_Guy Hey @DonaldJTrumpJr what's your thought of the day here???   @seanhannity do you have your ignorant theory's available yet??
930156411149053953 2017-11-13 19:32:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @espngolic I will miss the morning drive without this show.  You were great to get the day started too!
929874469606379520 2017-11-12 00:52:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @POTUS @ThisWeekABC @hughhewitt @ABC Except for @potus @seanhannity @KellyannePolls    You are so tainted that you can't even see the truth.
929873561690525696 2017-11-12 00:48:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nbc4i Of course he is.  I respect his military background, but think he is a self righteous right wing self serving individual who will never stand up or for anything @JoshMandelOhio
929872789493837826 2017-11-12 00:45:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ThisWeekABC @hughhewitt @ABC Literally the only smart thing she has ever said.
929452680350785536 2017-11-11 20:56:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> have to really feel for the @GOP if a man who sexually abused a 14 year old,a pedophile and a draft dodging, pussy grabbing , Russian lover @realDonaldTrump is better than any democrat.  You will literally choose anything over a democrat.  No moral compass
929435046825594880 2017-11-11 19:45:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump Means nothing from me.  I served honorably and didn't hide from bogus foot issues.  You dishonor the country I served with your ignorant behavior
929018219754590208 2017-11-10 16:09:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MailOnline @PressSec @jaketapper @dmartosko I don't like her or her lies, but as a man I would do the same.  She's still a lady and deserve to be treated as such.
928719664473169920 2017-11-09 20:23:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> I will miss the show as it was @MikeAndMike and it was a great ride and thanks for the many hours of entertainment as I drove to and from meetings.   Will miss the bets the most.  Loved hearing @espngolic talk about my hometown of Cleveland in such a positive light.
928717243034296320 2017-11-09 20:13:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr We're looking forward to seeing you go down in history as one of the worst families ever.  Hopefully you can live with that.
927377343005552640 2017-11-05 03:29:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @daldridgetnt He's a usaf veteran and is honorable . isn't afraid to question @realDonaldTrump @POTUS when it comes to policy/ethics and priorities
927376262674440193 2017-11-05 03:25:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @NRA Boy @GregAbbott_TX you really need to be EMBARRASSED!!!   Let's pick up the pace even more!!!   Vote for more guns and less restrictions!!!
926544149737766913 2017-11-03 20:18:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN I thought @realDonaldTrump had an impeccable memory and you are "really smart".
926242288577196032 2017-11-02 00:19:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Hey @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump how's this going over?!? hate to be there for thanksgiving, especially if @SteveKBannon showing up.

925805672951898112 2017-11-01 19:24:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DonaldJTrumpJr Can we add @realDonaldTrump to this list!?!? Dad is a predator like the rest. Tell your friends to "grab them by the pussy" #punktrumpkids
925804929905766401 2017-11-01 19:21:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @TheOfficialPORP How ironic is this @monya531 @KRolfe25 that the kid @DonaldJTrumpJr doesn't know what socialism is.  Daddy clearly passed his brains along
925565274237079553 2017-10-31 03:28:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DeanyStrong The @BlueJacketsNHL did him a lifetime day, it's up to us to give him a lifetime.https://www.youcaring.com/ashleybandavanis-787530

925101746250272768 2017-10-30 20:46:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas This is juicy, the @realDonaldTrump saying that he was a key part of the team.  @PressSec want to reconsider telling the truth?
925072492338864130 2017-10-30 18:50:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytpolitics Clearly didn't learn about integrity.
925071261637795840 2017-10-30 18:45:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tiffany1985B Thanks love.  Can't wait to see yall soon.

922861878514139136 2017-10-24 16:26:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Dairy_Co Great job team 6
922096710813405184 2017-10-22 13:46:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN represent your state and do something @SenSherrodBrown  Openly saying key advisors to @POTUS are racist and doing nothing is complicit
921882272936099841 2017-10-21 23:33:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> The @BlueJacketsNHL you are the best.  Thanks for making Deanys night memorable!!
921505094134267910 2017-10-20 22:35:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JustJOSH_ingYa This is great!!   Our society needs to protect each other from hate and injustice
921048118174633984 2017-10-19 16:19:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Oh this guy is someone who doesn't understand the law as it was written.  He makes loose interpretations and will be Bannons puppet.
920738105279250432 2017-10-18 19:47:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper My cousin was a marine and lost in combat, I can say how special these men and women are.  As an airman and we all look after each other
918502527720738817 2017-10-12 15:44:02 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Indians Great season with so much excitement.  Wish it ended better but it was fun!   2018 here we come
918455337484804096 2017-10-12 12:36:31 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas And they cheer. Clearly a group of either extremely rich people or extremely ignorant.   I lean to the latter with his "followers"
918268644077047809 2017-10-11 00:14:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Indians Bring it Cleveland.  We love you Cleveland
916009014756028418 2017-10-05 18:35:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Excited about the Game.Go tribe @Indians. My girlfriend doesn't know this yet but she's watching the game or watching me watch the game.
915971172390621184 2017-10-05 16:05:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @StacyGSG Mcgreeny versus mcsteamy.
915900388842369024 2017-10-05 11:24:03 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Great convo @MGolicJR57 @espngolic @Espngreeny standing up to sexism.  As a father of an 11 year old who I tell her she can do anything
913824804553273344 2017-09-29 17:56:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes Funny thing is his followers don't care.  All they care is to roll back everything the president Obama did.  Even to their detriment
913747170964262912 2017-09-29 12:47:56 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MikeAndMike It's great since you can drink and smoke cigars and actually get better!   That swing lube always makes me better!  Go Indians @espngolic
913021604539637760 2017-09-27 12:44:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> I'm a Vet and don't have any issue with anyone peacefully protesting @MikeAndMike  I want to know I fought for equality for all US citizens
912763787865985024 2017-09-26 19:40:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @mrs_pinky85 white people are the majority then naturally up to white people to work on the solution that we created. We work together to fix it.
912482517487366144 2017-09-25 01:02:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> It's not a stunt to the people who are choosing to find a way to get listened.   How would they get your attention to the injustice?
912480297714946048 2017-09-25 00:53:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @molratty So what I said was true.  Follow the thread because we cleared up a few things that were not clear.  But thanks for jumping in.
912479907346833408 2017-09-25 00:52:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chrylis I'm white and not a racist.
912479347260436481 2017-09-25 00:50:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> So how do you suggest they get a way to get your attention?   Glad you see the issue and only have umbrage with the method they chose.
912477993934737409 2017-09-25 00:44:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> You literally just said you will tune out to them kneeling.  They are trying to bring up the racial injustice in our country.
912477718553546752 2017-09-25 00:43:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @ThePurpleCat16 you suggest we have citizens break the law?  How about letting them protest and understand why.  Its not about the flag! Racial inequality
912476976090353670 2017-09-25 00:40:38 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> So how will you listen to what the racial injustices are happening!   You are not even listening at all, you tune out.
912469819391397889 2017-09-25 00:12:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Kenkong909 As a veteran I fought 4 their right to say what they want.  Take a moment to listen to why they do this and TRY to understand racial issues
911607018980564997 2017-09-23 15:03:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SportsCenter @joibella19 @JacksonLogan29 Taylor swift did 1.5 million.  Sandra bullock 1 m.  Kardishians did 500k.  Please take literally 1 minute to do some research

909095437914779649 2017-09-16 16:43:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tiffany1985B So that means .  But I will admit I had a lifted jeep!
909095264857853952 2017-09-16 16:42:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Indians @SportsTimeOhio What a great ride and fans are showing up.  @Royals are a class act!.  Now let's setup this team for an epic run to the World Series

903664456605028352 2017-09-01 17:02:50 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @idiotsabound1 So sorry to hear this.
903360527941947392 2017-08-31 20:55:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY This is a great story about making the best of a bad situation.  Way to show how to be an inspiration
903267070900670465 2017-08-31 14:43:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Hey @LeBatardShow what about rainy day women by Dylan.  It's not the get stoned song
903013424992587779 2017-08-30 21:55:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SportsCenter a buckeye who has a an 11 year old daughter, this is great.  I love the bucks,showing this little lady she owns the world is better
902167182439833601 2017-08-28 13:53:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SethAMandel This is disgusting and doing no good.   Stay peaceful and your message will come across, right now you are embarrassing yourself!
902165537425412098 2017-08-28 13:46:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @HorowitzJason @dannykanell Looking forward to hearing you again!!   Time to add 84 to my favorites!!
901410254294056962 2017-08-26 11:45:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MatureTrumpTwts We're blessed that @realDonaldTrump has an opposing tweet for everything he currently says or does.   Please hurry Mueller!!!
901407160604774400 2017-08-26 11:33:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara Those are some angry citizens who have every right to be angry.  I could see the GOP turning here shorty.   They can't wait any longer
901405588730544129 2017-08-26 11:26:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @phoenixnewtimes @michesf @amysilvermanaz Only 40% of the voting population voted!   Most absent were minority's.   So voting is the best and let's get someone to represent all.
901252196406349826 2017-08-25 01:17:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @abbydphillip Hopefully the GOP will finally stand up to @realDonaldTrump and see what he really is.  Hiding all this bs with a major disaster on us.
900910651538845696 2017-08-24 02:40:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper @MarkSimoneNY Take the 5 minutes.  This is hilarious
900369178397466629 2017-08-23 14:48:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas I'm glad I served my time and didn't have to respond to his orders.
900155101775626241 2017-08-22 00:37:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN @marcmode They didn't deny it.  How is that fake?!?
900148452289630209 2017-08-22 00:11:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Birm I love this as a cavs fan!!
900140632328548354 2017-08-22 23:40:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GoodmanESPN @SportsCenter This was a win for @cavs and hopefully @KingJames sees this.  I love my Cleveland and what they did to win
899798364954537984 2017-08-21 01:00:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Why is @realDonaldTrump wearing glasses if he doesn't believe what the scientists say?  Is he picking and choosing what to believe?
898204923975929857 2017-08-17 15:28:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> served in the usaf. was an honor to fight for this country. would have a hard time @realDonaldTrump honoring your orders
898203960804343808 2017-08-17 15:24:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Fake history and manipulation of facts is what @realDonaldTrump works off of!https://twitter.com/billkristol/status/898200453472817156
898202423147233280 2017-08-17 15:18:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FortuneMagazine We all are!!
898190852027285504 2017-08-17 14:32:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> President Trumps false claim that counterprotesters lacked a permit https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/08/16/president-trumps-false-claim-that-counter-demonstrators-lacked-a-permit/
897914907181465600 2017-08-16 20:16:10 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas Is the Wall Street considered fake news @realDonaldTrump ?   Funny you tried to manipulate the story to show you weren't dumped
897271075532361728 2017-08-14 01:37:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN can't wait to hear @realDonaldTrump has to say?  temper will b on how under armour is a "loser" because clothes don't fit his perfect body
897108467969912832 2017-08-14 14:51:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Now this is how you lead by example!   Wish @realDonaldTrump could show something called leadership, but that's not winning
896861472051138562 2017-08-13 22:30:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @BillKristol An elephants faith is 100%
896385026509688832 2017-08-12 14:56:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @TheDweck Ignorant Americans here.   Family has to be proud to see their boys all over the news because of their hate and intolerance.
896008396150890497 2017-08-11 14:00:23 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas Oh please don't use a war to get approvals @realDonaldTrump. The fact is regardless of a war or not, we will still not approve of you
894943810148544523 2017-08-08 15:30:06 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Irony !
894597364836642816 2017-08-07 16:33:27 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Man child with no self control with a phone = @realDonaldTrump
894529793781374976 2017-08-07 12:04:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PhilipRucker The irony that @realDonaldTrump is corroding others regarding a military career.
894528975061516288 2017-08-07 12:01:41 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper @abbydphillip My 11 year old daughter has more self control than @realDonaldTrump   Even she knows to think before you speak.
894518026200023041 2017-08-07 11:18:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Alleged!!   Come on, your own agencies have all said they have.  Stop drinking @realDonaldTrump cool aide please.   Be accountable
894517187700031488 2017-08-07 11:14:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> I disagree with @MikeAndMike @espngolic that Brady has the right to hide his concussion.  He has an obligation to disclose all injuries
893197713969487872 2017-08-03 19:51:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tiffany1985B I should never have any memory loss with this study.   Glad I like to drink.
892834777740562432 2017-08-02 19:49:33 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY Oh baby can't wait to see what @realDonaldTrump tweets about this.  Guess we can assume it's a fake news story and 78% are really approving
892831727785267201 2017-08-02 19:37:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @PreetBharara Agreed.  It's the consistency of the lies is what should make us irate and terrified.
891850555542392835 2017-07-30 02:38:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tiffany1985B Love you Tiff!   T and I will come out
891845285382684675 2017-07-30 02:17:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Rosie @KRolfe25 Keep calling him cheeto and a fraud.  @realDonaldTrump hates that the public is literally laughing at his orange face and pointless banter
891832401504108545 2017-07-30 01:26:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara Sales 101 under commit & over deliver. I would have thought that @realDonaldTrump would know that.  According to him he's a master
891714948623192065 2017-07-30 17:39:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC this is the definition of insanity.  I get the impression that  is certainly insane and keep trying is easier than gaining knowledge
891638576592637953 2017-07-30 12:36:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper Funny how @Scaramucci asked to keep the civilians (he is one!) out of the press while @ArthurSchwartz openly threatened @Reince #goons
891630554466197505 2017-07-30 12:04:24 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Scaramucci @jaketapper Reince will be doing a tell all soon.   Get your popcorn  and watch the mess that cheeto @realDonaldTrump has created.
891623374954397696 2017-07-30 11:35:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @MichelleObama @CNN @markabarger How about ignorant people learn to treat others not like them with dignity and class.   This was an amazing lady who cared for our youth
891605502672687105 2017-07-30 10:24:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN So this deal isn't done but cheeto @realDonaldTrump is poking china via twitter everyday.  Is his poking just another diversion? 
891605012819968000 2017-07-30 10:22:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas Moron = cheeto (@realDonaldTrump )   Lets provoke a powerhouse via twitter.  This won't work out well for anyone.
891511062520090624 2017-07-29 04:09:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Doesn't everyone realize that if we all poke fun at cheeto @realDonaldTrump that he has to respond.  #thinskintrump
891510329540313088 2017-07-29 04:06:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DavidCornDC Hey cheeto @realDonaldTrump know your history before you barf  to the free world. My 11 year old daughter knows more about civics
891508470733828096 2017-07-29 03:59:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @GlennThrush Hey Cheeto @realDonaldTrump can you please act like the leader of the free world?  Use diplomacy and lead!!!  I served the USA, your turn
891345362123972608 2017-07-29 17:11:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SykesCharlie @MarkHarrisNYC Keep laughing at @realDonaldTrump  the thin orange skin will attack because of that skin.  Plus the world is laughing at, not with him 
891285297782239232 2017-07-29 13:12:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @naretevduorp Anything to undo pres Obama is his only goal.  After pres Obama openly mocked ( justified) @realDonaldTrump wants to destroy O's policies
891047681241513984 2017-07-28 21:28:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Train wreck
890893896145936384 2017-07-28 11:17:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt You wanted a conference and so did the people.  gop pushing w/o clear solution was the disaster. No cross isle conversations killed this.
890770715535974400 2017-07-27 03:07:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tiffany1985B This is better than the candidate showing us his hand size and comparison to his penis size.  Not really surprised at all 
890613828521648129 2017-07-27 16:44:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tiffany1985B And bloody Mary's.
890613478775332864 2017-07-27 16:42:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @BillKristol Walk away and then go to th Feds.  You are above all this.  This is like the movie boiler room.  Be the one to save everyone and yourself
890603901015269380 2017-07-27 16:04:51 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Let's hope he keeps this promise.  Without it he loses all credibility with the president.
890603603496513536 2017-07-27 16:03:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Wow!!   A GOP standing up for democracy.
890561448488955904 2017-07-27 13:16:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Sounds like the staff is trying to do the right thing for the country.
890548052250984448 2017-07-27 12:22:55 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Scaramucci @jaketapper @danmericaCNN Literally the smartest thing to come out of your mouth since you unofficially came on board.   Keep up the work our needed patriots
890546276961583108 2017-07-27 12:15:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @thehill So @GOP are you stunned?   If so try using your backbone and push back.  You owe this to our fore fathers who fought for our freedom
890545114195644416 2017-07-27 12:11:15 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt @JoyAnnReid Im in the security software space this is not new information. people pick the lowest cost solution that is a Russian corporation
890543987202957313 2017-07-27 12:06:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper @TimOBrien 8:04 am est and the White House has said something untrue; fact less; in typical fashion tried to remove it after real facts disputed it
890539323107487745 2017-07-27 11:48:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN As much as I would love to really laugh about this, it's sad that this administration will not throughly vet who they talk too
890538675544743936 2017-07-27 11:45:40 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chucktodd That's a healthy stand on democracy.  Come on @GOP stand up for something.  This is not how governments operate.
890342794413449217 2017-07-26 22:47:18 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @Tiffany1985B Im there next year.  You and I can tear it up Oceanside style!
890342170028363778 2017-07-26 22:44:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @Tiffany1985B Or less!   My body can't handle all that alcohol.
890341757564715008 2017-07-26 22:43:11 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @realDonaldTrump @Tiffany1985B I agree.  Let's play a drinking game every time he does something stupid or unpresidential we do a shot!
890340509784449026 2017-07-26 22:38:13 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tiffany1985B So why does @realDonaldTrump keep bringing up someone he defeated? I am totally in agreement that he won based on the electoral college
890332807788101635 2017-07-26 22:07:37 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN I wish @Apple would dubunk this and let the world know that this was in the plans years ago.
890327065647607809 2017-07-26 21:44:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Guess we should have el chapo in charge of the dea; Enron executives in charge of the ethics committee
890326631516172294 2017-07-26 21:43:05 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DavidCornDC This is the new norm.  When you run your campaign on political incorrectness this is what you get.  Total loss of decency
890323200223191041 2017-07-26 21:29:26 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> trump is changing the topics again.  hiding something to distract the people.  Guesses on what it is?   I'll get the  and wait
890321166589710337 2017-07-26 21:21:22 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nbc4i Sorry but find something else to protest.  This man raped; beat; and murdered a 3 year old girl.  He should have been executed years ago
890313764318347264 2017-07-26 20:51:57 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> How would the country make up the money?  smells fishy Trump now says he wants to tax the rich http://cnnmon.ie/2uy3tfG via @CNNMoney
890269956021026824 2017-07-26 17:57:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @KeithOlbermann Guess we can add freedom of religion to his lack of understanding America.  Go along with three separate branches, freedom of press.
890003145371398148 2017-07-25 00:17:39 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Please leave our state.
889970575602585601 2017-07-25 22:08:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN He's the most self serving person ever.   No such thing as service before self with @realDonaldTrump

889891825393303552 2017-07-25 16:55:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara Well in @realDonaldTrump world it does.  Maybe he forgot how amazing America is and how we are built on checks and balances.
889891194913914885 2017-07-25 16:52:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY Paul Ryan says Trump gets to decide Jeff Sessions' future as Attorney General https://usat.ly/2v4YcOl via @usatoday
889866708386762752 2017-07-25 15:15:30 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @DavidCornDC It's a new type of president, every 5 minutes he flips a coin and goes from there.  No consistency at all.
889866319151149056 2017-07-25 15:13:58 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Get a spine please!   This president is walking over democracy and you want to not upset him.
889831042235994113 2017-07-25 12:53:47 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Shameless using kids to try and promote your jaded agenda.   You keep saying you want to run the country as a business; not how you do it
889470339322961921 2017-07-24 13:00:29 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas Can't wait to hear what trump has to say about this.
888482894766895104 2017-07-21 19:36:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN I want a job where I can say anything and nothing.  Thanks @realDonaldTrump  for promoting this.  @SarahHuckabee you sold your soul
888463288237002752 2017-07-21 18:18:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoshMandelOhio America was founded on religious freedom, not Christian values.  As a veteran you need to go back and understand why you served.
888461719605051393 2017-07-21 18:12:35 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @JoshMandelOhio Stop.  Your desire to get up the ladder is getting in the way of doing your current job.  Do what we pay you to do.
888451000767565824 2017-07-21 17:29:59 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes What a joke!   Surrounding yourself with "yes" people is a bad strategy.  Get someone to push back and question you @realDonaldTrump
888449393074081792 2017-07-21 17:23:36 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Where are your goods and your daughters made?   Irony that your goods are made outside our country.
888441979394306048 2017-07-21 16:54:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper This is an easy conversation @SenateGOP , do something please!!  @realDonaldTrump is going to always do what's best for him / family
888439365759905792 2017-07-21 16:43:45 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes @WatchdogDiva @mislaww003 @Liana_Mabe Usa banks wouldn't give him credit.  Russia has and that's his loyalty.  Money is his motivation, sad that he's ok with that
888436161739358209 2017-07-21 16:31:01 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Do something @SenateGOP then.  You have all the information and doing nothing is not your job.  Representative of your people is your job
888435268122021888 2017-07-21 16:27:28 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Guess lying isn't something he enjoys.  Maybe just maybe he has a conscience.   If he's catholic, that will be one long confession
888357360665800704 2017-07-21 11:17:54 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes @WatchdogDiva @mislaww003 @Liana_Mabe It's Russian money.  Putin wanted his return in his investment in trump.   Destroying democracy was an added bonus
888213891561476096 2017-07-20 01:47:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes Trying to discredit the independent investigation?!?   As a veteran I demand to know why we all fight
888174113814171648 2017-07-20 23:09:44 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @USATODAY @usatopinion Legally no.   Morally yes.  system worked and failed at the same time. found not guilty of murder; over sentencing on robbery charge
888168496940679169 2017-07-20 22:47:25 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> Could this explain our president?? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia
888166598107856897 2017-07-20 22:39:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Another piece of the puzzle.  I don't think Russia cares about our democracy; trump owes them money and that's what they want!!
888146136636280833 2017-07-20 21:18:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> We always believe in our great country.  I defended this land with my life.  It's you who 70% of us don't believe in @realDonaldTrump
888122649133555712 2017-07-20 19:45:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Who really knows what he thinks.  I honestly think he is the main character from 50 first dates.  Every day is a clean slate
888073352191119360 2017-07-20 16:29:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @FortuneMagazine Things just got interesting.  What's he hiding that he had to say this.   Sure sounds like their is something there.
887992689295282176 2017-07-20 11:08:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNNPolitics Pulling for a full recovery!   A true hero
887811569664618496 2017-07-19 23:09:07 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> funny pro trump don't care about Russia.  worse is that money motivated him to work with Russia and he only cares about his money.
887807548853809154 2017-07-19 22:53:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @chicagotribune Money.  The Russians want their money back.  Trump ran to Russia when he couldn't get loans here.   Putin wanted his money back!!
887800292846305280 2017-07-19 22:24:19 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CNN Didn't see it; don't have the whole story, i see why so many are literally laughing at him.  What an unbelievably unqualified person
887288378680647681 2017-07-18 12:30:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @brianklaas Guess having no clue and promising everything to your constituents pays off.  Running on "believe me" with no integrity can backfire
887026070117130241 2017-07-17 19:07:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @markpantoni BOOM!!!

886749229795999744 2017-07-16 00:47:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SykesCharlie @jdawsey1 Another lie from the trump family.  Can't wait to see how this unfolds
885252143170678785 2017-07-12 21:38:52 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @SenDeanHeller @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt Time to put party aside and do what's best for the country.  Come up with a better solution than what's on the table.

885147663917662209 2017-07-12 14:43:42 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @washingtonpost Until you don't profess your loyalty to the president.  I love this pick if he can remain independent.
885147052060983297 2017-07-12 14:41:17 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tiffany1985B That's going to be a great thanksgiving holiday this year!   I think they need to sell seats and if Don can make a buck he would!
885146015254413314 2017-07-12 14:37:09 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @PreetBharara Hopefully the GOP will start to disassociate. He is hurting the great nation I put my life on the line for.  The GOP can do better and will
885136747616768000 2017-07-12 14:00:20 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @jaketapper I wish I could pick and choose / flip flop anytime I feel it's in my best interest.   Unfortunately I learned integrity at a young age.

880561971128451074 2017-06-29 23:01:48 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Tiffany1985B Just disparaging comments towards a lady and a critic.  I've seen better behavior out of a 12 year old.
880437905763823616 2017-06-29 14:48:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes Couple questions:  what's he hiding; how are republicans still defending him.   This bulling women needs to stop.

865763041975128070 2017-05-19 02:56:08 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @hughhewitt Don't you think that trying to deflect attention to what's real will ultimately hurt your party?  Focus on this day and move on

864602920213512192 2017-05-16 22:06:14 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @tupperward @mattyglesias If this is true, something needs to happen from the GOP leadership!!   But I'm confident they will continue to stand for nothing.
864256462318706693 2017-05-15 23:09:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @nytimes Well this shouldn't be tolerated, but most of his team will spin this with republicans saying it's not true.   Embarrassed!!

860496807889178624 2017-05-05 14:10:00 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Landgrant33 These are too close @CoachZachSmith    But your receivers will have more success than him.  You build men; he builds up himself
860263033683234816 2017-05-04 22:41:04 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @YahooSports Let's consider the source.  Curt has some very radical far right views.  He should stick to bloody socks and failed gaming companies
859108746554953728 2017-05-01 18:14:21 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CurtisSamuel4__ @CoachZachSmith You are back coach!!   Browns will always be in your blood.  It's a curse.  But... they need some buckeye talent up there in the land!

857792668432293888 2017-04-27 03:04:43 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> This pick is confusing.   Take a guy that doesn't have a position?   Smh Cleveland browns. After trading down

857789783808102400 2017-04-27 02:53:16 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> How far down will they trade again @CoachZachSmith?    They are still driving me crazy.   So who is your next team?https://twitter.com/dawgsbynature/status/857787118248235012
857779091625435137 2017-04-27 02:10:46 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CoachZachSmith @wagnerrangers That's a Cleveland move.  Doesn't make sense for Washington to do this.  Nothing left without cousins.  Plus way too much $$
857778527944544256 2017-04-27 02:08:32 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @wagnerrangers @CoachZachSmith Just please don't make it the ravens!   Go for the steelers if you have to.  They love buckeye nation.
857777782985814020 2017-04-27 02:05:34 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @CoachZachSmith @wagnerrangers It's always next year in Cleveland . Better shore up that defense because we are not scoring much this year

857775172711067648 2017-04-27 01:55:12 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> This is crazy.  I'm getting draft results faster via twitter than direct tv.   I'm getting updates well before any announcement on tv.
857774069206441984 2017-04-27 01:50:49 UTC <Patrick_Rolfe> @Browns @jrisgr88 @CoachZachSmith I think the natural new hoodie is in the bayou!   Go bucks!!   Browns 2054 champs lol.
