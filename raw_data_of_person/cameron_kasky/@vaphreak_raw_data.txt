888232035046838273 2017-07-20 02:59:54 UTC <vaphreak> @TrumpTrain17 Made over past six months. I mean, for god sake, did you read the emails?
888231840988921857 2017-07-20 02:59:08 UTC <vaphreak> @TrumpTrain17 Lol, Transparency? He posted them because the New York Times was going too. His emails undercut every claim he, trump, and republicans have
888231290700521473 2017-07-20 02:56:56 UTC <vaphreak> @POTUS @sherrynron Why so scared and need to fire people if Trump did nothing? Trump has no credibility. Only place he's going is jail. Treasonous traiter
888231049117020160 2017-07-20 02:55:59 UTC <vaphreak> @POTUS @sherrynron Valid investigation and you don't care. You're ruining this country. Sad!
888229789882081280 2017-07-20 02:50:59 UTC <vaphreak> @TrumpTrain17 Or maybe him being angry that Jeff sessions recused himself wasn't enough for you? Or Don Jr.'s emails? Never enough for you partisan hacks
888229584755453953 2017-07-20 02:50:10 UTC <vaphreak> @TrumpTrain17 I'd love to know your reaction if Hillary fired Comey. Who trump himself said he fired because of "Russia."
888229444023922689 2017-07-20 02:49:36 UTC <vaphreak> @TrumpTrain17 I'd love credible proof of each attorney apart of the investigation that have openly questioned his integrity.
888229221985857536 2017-07-20 02:48:43 UTC <vaphreak> @TrumpTrain17 You have absolutely no proof for your claims. A few of the attorneys donated republican. It's irrelevant. Mueller is running the show.
888229068495364096 2017-07-20 02:48:07 UTC <vaphreak> @TrumpTrain17 How does that cloud ones judgment? Because Gorsuch was appointed by a republican does he all of a sudden lose all credibility?
888228159765831680 2017-07-20 02:44:30 UTC <vaphreak> @TrumpTrain17 What you're doing is hurting this country. Mueller is more of a man then draft dodging trump. War Vet and brilliant.
888227964307083264 2017-07-20 02:43:43 UTC <vaphreak> @TrumpTrain17 What does he have to hide? Shouldn't a nonguilty person welcome an investigation to clear his name?

862495869383430144 2017-05-10 02:33:34 UTC <vaphreak> @ScottGreenfield @GregDarr Once again, whether something is "legal" does not solely depend on whether its "constitutional" or not. Lots of crimes/laws aren't addressed
862495643922726917 2017-05-10 02:32:40 UTC <vaphreak> @ScottGreenfield So we end an analysis based on "constitutionality." Murder is not addressed by the constitution. Obstruction of justice is not either.
862495145433890818 2017-05-10 02:30:41 UTC <vaphreak> @JoshMBlackman Not a constitutional issue but an obstruction of justice issue (if the alleged motives for the firing are to impede the investigation).
862154122895687680 2017-05-09 03:55:35 UTC <vaphreak> @StefanMolyneux Please explain to you know Hillary would do that? What's the precedent for POTUS firing an individual that's investigating him? --> Nixon.
862118089466445826 2017-05-09 01:32:24 UTC <vaphreak> @AnnCoulter @retired728 @MellonFollie Wrong. Haha, did you not listen to Comey's testimony a few months ago.

805958156736233473 2016-12-05 02:12:53 UTC <vaphreak> @dlaw95 good luck! Kill it man. Cheering for you
805854168489586688 2016-12-05 19:19:40 UTC <vaphreak> @zjwhitman we're inconsistent but those losses are inexplicable. Fair point - easy to be skeptical of VT. Wish VT v Colorado
805849551684993024 2016-12-05 19:01:19 UTC <vaphreak> @MatejS247 let's hope our offense doesn't make them look like the Alabama defense.

805493819840012288 2016-12-04 19:27:46 UTC <vaphreak> @zjwhitman Va Tech would kill Colorado and it wouldn't be close. Colorado is garbage and so is the Pac 12
805491906436362240 2016-12-04 19:20:10 UTC <vaphreak> @ChrisColemanTSL Just would love to play a Florida or Auburn. Team w/ a pulse that gets us credit. Rather than freaking Arkansas

805472210660028417 2016-12-04 18:01:54 UTC <vaphreak> @belkbowl @TechSideline I don't want Arkansas. Give us Florida. Give us a damn ranked game

804929324415680512 2016-12-02 06:04:40 UTC <vaphreak> Pitt is a current ranked win. UNC was ranked at time of win
804928579674996736 2016-12-02 06:01:42 UTC <vaphreak> @michaeltheg they do have that right. And the people have the right to boycott the product. Hence, an empty ACC Championship. Enjoy
804919949219209216 2016-12-02 05:27:25 UTC <vaphreak> @LAOJoe I don't think we're good enough to beat Clemson. My only point is that Pitt is too inconstitent. (So are we)
804919742326837248 2016-12-02 05:26:35 UTC <vaphreak> @LAOJoe Maybe PSU is overrated? Auburn is overrated also. Auburn has 0 wins against teams above 7 wins. VT is a good team when keeping ball

803394110308622336 2016-11-28 00:24:16 UTC <vaphreak> @aadelsonESPN when the Hokies lose it's because of dumb turnovers. Tech is a tough team when they protect the ball

803325658793410560 2016-11-28 19:52:16 UTC <vaphreak> there goes the conservative logic. Wanting fair treatment of all citizens = hating cops. You see the logical jump?
