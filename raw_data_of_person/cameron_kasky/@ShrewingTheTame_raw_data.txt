972129453512957952 2018-03-09 15:18:17 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Twitter has taught me that I'm not alone in my love for Bruno Mars.

971824939597676546 2018-03-08 19:08:15 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @MrFilmkritik This is the same guy who believes humans have a finite amount of energy, therefore you shouldn't work out or else you'll die sooner, so yes, I'm pretty sure you are correct.
971434007551344640 2018-03-07 17:14:50 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @Emma4Change Oh good! Maybe she can lecture you on the joys of oppressive student loan debt since she profits from it. Are students with disabilities allowed to talk to her or does she personally discriminate them from her presence as well as in schools?
970715778826698752 2018-03-05 17:40:51 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @lauren_hoggs I'm just laughing at whomever thought filming a crazy-eyed lunatic holding an oversized hourglass while reading a script could actually invoke fear in athletes, actors, teenage survivors of a mass shooting, and anyone else who sees through this nonsense.
970710576576933888 2018-03-05 17:20:11 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @NRATV How much money did LaPierre make last year? How often is he on TV? How is this guy not considered "elite"?
970696614900785153 2018-03-05 16:24:42 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @DLoesch @NRATV So what exactly will happen to the athletes who use their 1A rights to protest police brutality? Is Marshawn Lynch supposed to be scared of lady crazy eyes holding an oversized hourglass for some reason? I don't see that happening anytime soon.

He loves to drink hard when traveling and the guy in this pic does look like him. I genuinely want to know if this is him. Crazy, right??!
969288983678078976 2018-03-01 19:11:16 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @Austan_Goolsbee @businessinsider I'm just sitting here casually wondering if this is my ex-husband. So there's that.
969070782931386368 2018-02-28 04:44:13 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @Swillbury All terms are made up. This is an umbrella term describing the criminalization of a variety of disciplinary actions that don't usually result in criminal court involvement for the upper middle class. It's a valid racial/socioeconomic concern.
969028605341675522 2018-02-28 01:56:37 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @Swillbury That wasn't the point. The existence of the school to prison pipeline is what you challanged.
969027167848873984 2018-02-28 01:50:55 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @jemelehill @Swillbury Pointing out the word "please" and Googling for you on demand is literally the complete opposite of a vitriol reaction.

966689309167304705 2018-02-22 15:01:06 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @cameron_kasky This happened last November in a CO Walmart. So many guns were pulled once the shooter started shooting that it caused confusion and lengthened the investigation for police.

964518802078646272 2018-02-16 15:16:16 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @AJentleson I want the AR-15 back on the ban list, the boyfriend loophole to close, background checks, guns to be insured and registered, raise the age of legal gun ownership, a comprehensive national buy back program, & I want the NRA to fund the funerals or med costs.
963935203751182336 2018-02-14 00:37:16 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @senrobportman Return the millions the NRA paid for your inaction. Then work on a solution or quit.
963933528336384000 2018-02-14 00:30:36 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Pretending we are helpless has to be one of the most cowardly, un-American responses we could have. It's absolutely embarrassing.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/963932902223380481

963920158275194880 2018-02-14 23:37:29 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @marcorubio $3,303,355.00. Now is the time to return every cent you received from the NRA. $3,303,355.00.
963447796719169541 2018-02-13 16:20:29 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> I think what I like most about the Obama portrait is how it opens up the discussion about Art to people who don't discuss the topic often. People love it, people hate it, and people are talking about it. Art evokes and it inspires. Remembering this is a good thing.
963112962633252864 2018-02-12 18:09:58 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @washingtonpost I don't condone arresting them, but judging by the photos, they really are awful dancers. Maybe sentence them to dance lessons?

963062917288534016 2018-02-12 14:51:06 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @MrFilmkritik He received his blue check while spewing his anti-semitism nonsense so I assume the only reason why Twitter finally suspended him is that they couldn't ignore the overwhelming amount of complaints from other users. Actual content doesn't seem to matter much.
962876590488104965 2018-02-11 02:30:43 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @JohnCornyn The point is to score more points than the other team. Same point as all team sports, John. Try Googling it to learn the rules. Educate yourself.

955247561056514048 2018-01-21 01:15:40 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @realDonaldTrump Did #PresidentMiller instruct you to tweet this message? According to Graham, it's Miller calling the shots now. Sad!

941861624591167489 2017-12-15 02:44:44 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @CharlesMBlow What happens if the CDC refuses to comply?
940717569996025856 2017-12-12 22:58:41 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @realDailyWire Just look at how shiny and heavy that failure award is. So. Much. Failure.
938297827381391367 2017-12-05 06:43:29 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @CheriJacobus @EWErickson Nonsense how exactly?
938245408916094976 2017-12-05 03:15:11 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @WME @deray @terrycrews Thank you for speaking up.
938083162462154753 2017-12-05 16:30:29 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Just when I think I couldn't possibly love John Oliver more than I already do, he confronts a member of the Hollywood elite over sexual misconduct allegations. Standing fucking ovation John. Well done.
937472793062539266 2017-12-03 00:05:05 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @xnulz @Malala comes to mind.
936245693877850112 2017-11-30 14:49:02 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @MrFilmkritik Remember that time Jesus was banned from malls and accused of sexually preying on kids? Yeah, me neither.
936242951008673794 2017-11-30 14:38:08 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @FeministaJones This was my first thought as well. I'm all out of Fs to give when it comes to the mental/emotional wellbeing of sexual harassers.
935561905812340736 2017-11-28 17:31:54 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @EricTrump No one expects you to understand this issue Eric.
935287290443603968 2017-11-27 23:20:41 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @laurenduca @bayofarizona No one said it was the same, but neither should be tolerated. A punch to the face isn't the same as a knife to the chest, but that doesn't mean I have to accept one over the other. Both suck.
935284210054471681 2017-11-27 23:08:27 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Just watched the WaPo video. The asshole is someone named Jaime Phillips.
935282369912639488 2017-11-27 23:01:08 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Pedophiles are the absolute worst. People who pose as fake victims in order to discredit real victims of pedophilia is a very close second. Who was this woman who agreed to this disgusting Project Veritas BS?
935276639935643648 2017-11-27 22:38:22 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Let's get one thing straight about the assholes at Project Veritas. This wasn't just about embarrassing WaPo, this was an attempt to discredit victims of sexual abuse everywhere. Hug your kids, folks. They turn into shit stains like this when you don't.
935253008467705857 2017-11-27 21:04:28 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @Simone_Biles They deserve adequate pay for their time and commitment. Until that happens, I don't understand the point. They're beautiful and talented and completely taken for granted IMO.
934687392950190080 2017-11-25 07:36:54 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> This BS is dangerous AF.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/934551607596986368
934185213843865600 2017-11-24 22:21:25 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> I applaud FLOTUS for wearing her coat at home. Makes for a quick getaway when @POTUS gets grabby again.https://twitter.com/FLOTUS/status/933393217860620289
933368608838651904 2017-11-22 16:16:32 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @fivefifths I feel he can be rehabilitated with real mac and cheese and a hug. Poor guy just doesn't know.
933367815762874368 2017-11-22 16:13:23 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> I forget it was on Tday eve that #TamirRice was murdered for simply being a kid. Idk why, but shooting this beautiful boy when he's on vacation and out of the house utilizing imagination play at the park just adds insult to grave injury. May they all kneel tomorrow in his memory.
933055683066347520 2017-11-21 19:33:04 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @jbarro It's a solid reminder of how short he is.
931919170433818624 2017-11-18 16:16:59 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @FeministaJones Love the glasses!
930092122174296066 2017-11-13 15:16:56 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @WSJ @JohnCornyn Maya Angelou was right. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.
929028847584018432 2017-11-10 16:51:52 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> My heart breaks for the victims of #RoyMooreChildMolester They are incredibly brave for coming forward.
929013744100921344 2017-11-10 15:51:51 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @WalshFreedom Right now he wants to be a man who stands against pedophilia. I support him on this.
928686351075168257 2017-11-09 18:10:54 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @BlackGirlNerds Standing ovation to whomever took these photos. Absolutely stunning.
928100994889670656 2017-11-07 03:24:55 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Love is trumping hate tonight!
927901436393877504 2017-11-07 14:11:56 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @thehill You know what also works to help the victims? Donating your NRA $ to pay their hospital or funeral bills. Try it Paul.
927778133016690688 2017-11-06 06:01:58 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> I'm pissed that the Carter Page testimony wasn't released last week. I would have gone as a Dodgy Dossier for Halloween.
927774075706945536 2017-11-06 05:45:51 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Carter Page really is this dumb. This truly is the Watergate of idiots.

927552713302274048 2017-11-06 15:06:14 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @RoyBlunt The victims could use the $4M+ you received from the NRA to pay for their hospital and/or funeral costs. Give them more than prayers.
927542855102369792 2017-11-06 14:27:04 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @NRA @GOP @FeministaJones I want them to donate every cent of that blood money to the victims. Help them pay their hospital or funeral bills.
927324226167619585 2017-11-05 23:58:19 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @GavinNewsom What they also need is for every politician who took NRA money to donate it to pay their hospital or funeral bills.
927320282380902401 2017-11-05 23:42:38 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @RepMcSally Go ahead and donate the $14k you took from the NRA to help the victims pay their hospital or funeral bills. Then do your damn job Martha.
927313034174898177 2017-11-05 23:13:50 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @senrobportman The $600k that the NRA purchased you for should be donated to the victims to help pay their hospital or funeral bills. Every cent Rob.

927309012911009792 2017-11-05 22:57:51 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @SenatorBurr I'm praying you have the moral courage to donate your NRA $ to the victims and then start doing your job.

927307557923778561 2017-11-05 22:52:05 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @SenatorRounds How about you donate the $82k that the NRA bought you with? Send every cent to the victims to help pay their hospital or funeral bills.
927306923283640320 2017-11-05 22:49:33 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @SenRonJohnson Donate the $600k+ you received from the NRA to the victims to help pay their hospital or funeral bills.  Every cent Ron.
927305350272782338 2017-11-05 22:43:18 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @SenatorIsakson The money you received from the NRA should be donated to the victims. I bet the 2 yr old child that got shot could use it for hospital bills
927300605776773120 2017-11-05 22:24:27 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @JohnCornyn You can provide your NRA money to pay for the hospital or funeral bills of the victims. Go ahead and offer every cent John.
927298516585652224 2017-11-05 22:16:09 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @GOPLeader Stand with the victims by donating your $14k from the NRA to help pay their hospital or funeral bills. Every bloody cent Kevin.

927284958288162816 2017-11-05 21:22:16 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @JackPosobiec Prepare yourself for The Brown Wedding. Winter is here.
927277352454823936 2017-11-05 20:52:03 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @ChrisMurphyCT Every politician who took NRA $ should be pressured to donate every cent to the victims.
927275920536231936 2017-11-05 20:46:22 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @SpeakerRyan What they also need is your NRA money to pay for their hospital or funeral bills. Donate every cent of that blood money Paul.
927272153837314048 2017-11-05 20:31:24 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @tedcruz When will you donate your NRA money to the victims? Today would be a good day to put your money where your prayers are.
927270868903800832 2017-11-05 20:26:17 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Every politician who took NRA $$ should donate every cent to pay hospital or funeral bills for the victims of gun violence.

926841420341698560 2017-11-04 15:59:49 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @200TO140 @coffeespoonie $1500 for a 3 mile trip to the hospital when my daughter had a seizure and dislocated her knee. This was with employer based insurance btw.
926571362642149376 2017-11-03 22:06:42 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @LindaJoyAdams Let me know if you find one.
926460249686421504 2017-11-03 14:45:10 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @anylaurie16 Excellent question. The DNC should have never been in the position to need the bailout to begin with.
926447135087718400 2017-11-03 13:53:04 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Please please PLEASE let this be true.https://twitter.com/RawStory/status/926243801127182336
926151282422722560 2017-11-02 18:17:27 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @shannonrwatts First he blamed his failures on the ACA and now he's blaming protesters. Heaven forbid he learns how to make an edible pizza instead.
926124792884879360 2017-11-02 16:32:11 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Stunning article by @donnabrazile. If this is how the DNC chooses to operate, then I'm no longer a Democrat.
925965162128875520 2017-11-01 05:57:52 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> I'm old enough to remember when the Papa John idiot blamed his profit loss on the ACA when he was literally giving gross pizzas away.
925751690547970049 2017-11-01 15:49:37 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> PSA for men: Using the words "boiled" and "clitoris" in the same sentence is NOT a pick up line. It's just gross.https://twitter.com/nypost/status/925732556951228416

917064613409067008 2017-10-08 16:30:16 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Wow. @FoxNews can't tell the difference between @SenSchumer and @SenBobCorker . Sad!

914960162271633408 2017-10-02 21:07:56 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> When is it the turn of gun fetishists to come up with a solution? If you think gun control isn't the solution, then tell me what is.

906895716345245696 2017-09-10 15:02:42 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @FeministaJones Are you including acts of giving non-sexualized love (raising kids, friendships, taking care of parents, etc)?

905475484242198528 2017-09-06 16:59:13 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @CJK_TOL I think that's the point. Even with compliance, he still received a loaded gun to his head.

905109086458355712 2017-09-05 16:43:16 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Not only should #DACA remain, every single Dreamer should be refunded the $$ they paid into DACA as an apology for this insanity.
904742563923587072 2017-09-04 16:26:51 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @skinnytoldem @Atohyt Lean is probably a trigger, but he definitely has the seizure disorder. He has talked about it in the past.
904726749958725633 2017-09-04 15:24:00 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @skinnytoldem He has epilepsy so seizures are unfortunately part of life for him. It's usually not life threatening though, just scary to witness.

898213751895216128 2017-08-17 16:03:41 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @Yekken_Rahim do you learn history from monuments? I recommend picking up a history book, visit a museum, or use Google. It's very easy.
897904992073392128 2017-08-16 19:36:47 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @riotwomennn Corp discriminatory hiring/firing practices are more unnerving to me than torch wielding nazis facing consequences for their actions.
897903655503880192 2017-08-16 19:31:28 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @riotwomennn Meanwhile, I know someone who was fired from a family owned vet bc the owners found out she was gay. Not for what she did, but who she is.
897811872501473280 2017-08-16 13:26:45 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Or watches the History channel. Or knows how the Google search engine works. Or watch the numerous movies & miniseries on historic events.https://twitter.com/ShrewingTheTame/status/897811352504328193
897811352504328193 2017-08-16 13:24:41 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Those who fear history is being erased is proof that not enough people read. Or visit museums. Or pay attention in school. Or research.
897805507489968128 2017-08-16 13:01:28 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Do history books & museums not exist where you are? To an insider like me, that's where we learn about our history, not from monuments.
897560277511675904 2017-08-15 20:47:00 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> If you're shocked @realDonaldTrump would defend nazis, then you're not paying attention to who he is and what he stands for.

885517016760823809 2017-07-13 15:11:23 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @guardian @povertynews Absolutely gut wrenching. I'm curious to know how much of the findings stem from food insecurity.

880608994477441024 2017-06-29 02:08:39 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @solomongeorgio Obama already shattered that stereotype when he followed Bush Jr.

877927788753321986 2017-06-22 16:34:30 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @JohnCornyn Heaven forbid complex bills impacting millions of Americans be well thought out and comprehensive.

832418427855896577 2017-02-16 02:36:33 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @solomongeorgio He attempted to treat her as if she was his personal assistant. It was both racist and misogynistic AF.

728222601064030208 2016-05-05 13:59:32 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @fakedansavage People don't usually refer to a man as "that". Funny how that works.
727897946843308032 2016-05-04 16:29:28 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> I honestly thought we would see a GOP contested convention this year.
727885781038030849 2016-05-04 15:41:08 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @Timcast I would say any civil rights related riots against groups who weren't white and male. Are you looking for specific examples?
727884178629398528 2016-05-04 15:34:46 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @matunos @Timcast Fair point...a sad point, but completely fair!
727883739200512000 2016-05-04 15:33:01 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @Timcast Does the Brooks Brothers riot in 2000 qualify? Honest question since many participants were actually paid staffers.
727882286096482304 2016-05-04 15:27:15 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @ChadHGriffin @PatMcCroryNC Does Pat always look this drunk?
719647033766727680 2016-04-11 22:03:17 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @ShaunKing hahahaaa
716793677352316928 2016-04-03 01:05:04 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> I love the new #Royals uniforms too, but can we take a minute to appreciate Salvy's gold knee pads?!?
715211555680296960 2016-03-30 16:18:17 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @ShaunKing More diversity is definitely needed. The silver lining: Cory Booker is a badass! NJ did a great job voting him in.
715025635878576128 2016-03-29 03:59:30 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @Andy @realDonaldTrump @davidgregory @CNN hyper sensitivity is a common trait of narcissists.
715023675892740096 2016-03-29 03:51:43 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @SOMEXlCAN seems incredibly unfair to 5 year olds.
715021002611109888 2016-03-29 03:41:06 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @ShaunKing The notion that middle aged women like me can't be a Bernie supporter and a feminist is also preposterous
714936800125521921 2016-03-29 22:06:30 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @deray this is awesome!
710683189971300352 2016-03-17 04:24:11 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @mepaulanewsome Finally catching up on HTGAWM and wow! Your performance gave me chills. Absolutely wonderful.
710253022081732608 2016-03-16 23:54:50 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @peteholmes THANK YOU! I have secretly thought the same thing for years. Only children can take cops in short seriously.
710140136881725441 2016-03-16 16:26:17 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @GOP Lame duck is an elected official continuing to hold office during  period between the election and the inauguration of a successor
710136829010247681 2016-03-16 16:13:08 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @nytopinion Come out ahead how? By waiting for Trump or Clinton to make the pick instead? They already know and like Garland.
710135736721276928 2016-03-16 16:08:47 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @SenToomey Your response is petty and wasteful. Grow up and do your job.
710126164124110849 2016-03-16 15:30:45 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @senorrinhatch @SenOrrinHatch We spoke loudly in 2012. Do you want to gamble on a Trump or Clinton #SCOTUSnominee instead? That's your strategy?
710123739724165120 2016-03-16 15:21:07 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Does the GOP really want to deny Obama's bipartisan #SCOTUS pick when Trump and Clinton are leading in the polls right now?
709456313063837697 2016-03-14 19:09:00 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Has anyone reached out to Greta Van Susteren yet to see how she's handling the Todd Palin news?
709410518927159296 2016-03-14 16:07:02 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @SarahKSilverman In a perfect world, every person that comments on this would take 5 min to actually read the article.
709409643529768961 2016-03-14 16:03:33 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @thenation I wish people would actually read the article before commenting on this subject.
708683520558784512 2016-03-12 15:58:12 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @CoryBooker @attn TX of all places is finally researching med marijuana for kids with epilepsy. Very very important.
708682925017989120 2016-03-12 15:55:50 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @jamiekilstein @DonaldJTrumpJr  Spot on Jamie! 1st Amm doesn't mean what you think it means Jr.
707730955553771520 2016-03-09 00:53:03 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @WillMcAvoyACN Note to self: Start using "keep fucking that chicken" because it's hilarious! Well said.
705794877347405825 2016-03-04 16:39:46 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @mrBobbyBones  Ummmm
705436840707248128 2016-03-03 16:57:03 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Still no fan of his politics, but it's refreshing to listen to Mitt Romney after months of Trump, Cruz, Carson crazy blabber
705107407089762304 2016-03-02 19:08:00 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @pattonoswalt @FullFrontalSamB I like Full Frontal more than the Daily Show now. I would LOVE to see it 4 or 5 nights/week.
704861192628641792 2016-03-01 02:49:38 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> As I watch this insane Trump speech, I'm mesmerized by Christie's blank, stepford wife stare.
704789231768502272 2016-03-01 22:03:41 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @MarkRuffalo Sen. Mike Rounds said this? Sounds about right. I assume most, if not all KKK members agree with him.
702530265990598657 2016-02-24 16:27:22 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @wagatwe Very true. I'm sorry you're going through this BS.
702527932183412736 2016-02-24 16:18:06 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @wagatwe Infuriating. Sometimes pharma companies will provide meds at lower cost when insurance doesn't cover.
701806541205155840 2016-02-22 16:31:33 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @libralexi Exactly. Report a mugging and no one questions what you were wearing, how many drinks you had or if you flaunted your wallet.
698661302781083648 2016-02-13 00:13:29 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @fortunefunny Then why is Cheney still alive?
694646291960172544 2016-02-02 22:19:16 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> I'm bored with this notion that @BernieSanders can't get things done. The Amendment King has a proven record of doing just that.
692507705169330177 2016-01-27 00:41:17 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @ShaunKing @DaRealAmberRose You can't go after the cub and not expect momma bear to go in for the kill.
692432023739351040 2016-01-27 19:40:33 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> Can you do it in Canada with Megyn  Kelly moderating or will you run away from that one too?https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/692430362966921217
692428400774909952 2016-01-27 19:26:10 UTC <ShrewingTheTame> @joshwolfcomedy His narcissism and misogyny can't handle female rejection.
