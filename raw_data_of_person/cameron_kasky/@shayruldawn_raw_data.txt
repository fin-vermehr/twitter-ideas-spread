972110282297405440 2018-03-09 14:02:06 UTC <shayruldawn> @blazingxmexican Similar thing happened to me yesterday - big ass truck blocking entire restaurant entrance.  I was stuck, stopped on a busy highway until he moved. But my biggest peeve is how and where they park.

972085536511942656 2018-03-09 12:23:47 UTC <shayruldawn> @xLiserx I hate that "didn't happen bullshit." I recently had a guy insist he could prove I don't live where I said. Had to laugh at that one - I've lived here since 1965.

972082168833900545 2018-03-09 12:10:24 UTC <shayruldawn> @xLiserx So annoying when people, especially people who don't know you, try to tell you what YOU are saying or what you think.

971049410577694720 2018-03-06 15:46:35 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump Only you and delusional people believe your administration is not a chaotic mess. We have virtually no State Dept. You've had more staff turnover than a Temp Agency. You hired criminals and wife beaters. Perfection in the WH is an illusion.
971034240870748162 2018-03-06 14:46:18 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump Stop lying about Democrats.  You could be meeting with them instead of tweeting at them.
971033867732836361 2018-03-06 14:44:49 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump Democrats gave you a deal and you turned it down. Where are the Republicans? McConnell promised debate on immigration. Where is he?
971033516501798913 2018-03-06 14:43:25 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump No. No we're not ready or willing to go hard in either direction.  You're insane.
971032091692617728 2018-03-06 14:37:46 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump Don't you have something important to do?
971004662961844224 2018-03-06 12:48:46 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump I believe the correct question is, where are the Republicans? You were given a bipartisan bill, which you wouldn't sign. And in January, Republicans agreed to debate immigration separately so Democrats would vote with them to reopen the government. Stop lying about Democrats.

The reaction of business and public is to NRA leadership's response to gun reform in the face of another gun violence tragedy. It has nothing to do with its members.

It's not because he's some great Patriot.  A patriot wouldn't incite Americans against Americans.  The duping of our country for profit continues.

966687926712176640 2018-02-22 14:55:36 UTC <shayruldawn> @NRA @realDonaldTrump If that was true they would be lobbying for sensible gun reform instead of lobbying against it,  paying legislators to help them make the public fear their guns will be taken away, and boosting the coffers of gun manufacturers.

963393848226525184 2018-02-13 12:46:07 UTC <shayruldawn> @CarolHoward I read Goshen College's Advent and Lenten devotionals for which they employ an overall or weekly theme.  In contrast, the guy I read most throughout the year seems to have an unending supply of anecdotes.
963389608917684224 2018-02-13 12:29:16 UTC <shayruldawn> @CarolHoward Oh wow. Now I won't even read them the same. One time , just one time, I tried to articulate my thoughts about a street preacher into a devotional - it was difficult!

960528689703407616 2018-02-05 15:01:00 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump More name calling. Clearly you have nothing to contribute to this country but your loud mouth and lies.
960527449183408128 2018-02-05 14:56:04 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump Actually we had a Feb 8th commitment.  And NO wall.
960527257507975169 2018-02-05 14:55:18 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump Another day, more lies about Democrats plus ignorant remarks about healthcare.  Go back to your stable!
960491853899616256 2018-02-05 12:34:37 UTC <shayruldawn> @jaySkatz It was an exciting game. Two great squads. No parked buses.

960393689783787520 2018-02-04 06:04:33 UTC <shayruldawn> @CharlesMBlow @NotoriousEEBs @sarafeh5 @RickJBrody That article implies the licensor approved the ad because it promotes a volunteer organization called Ram Nation. But the ad implies you join Ram Nation by buying a truck.
960388436292177920 2018-02-04 05:43:41 UTC <shayruldawn> @krassenstein @kbunucci Good grief!
960317719928299521 2018-02-04 01:02:40 UTC <shayruldawn> @KamalaHarris Thank you! The GOP has proven, over and over, they don't care about the environment, now or for the future. They only care about making money.
960311233923747840 2018-02-04 00:36:54 UTC <shayruldawn> @justyn_lfc Me neither

960303548138446848 2018-02-04 00:06:22 UTC <shayruldawn> @KVDK97 That was pretty shit.   The best is the Falcons kicker. No way he would've missed that.
960299875631017985 2018-02-04 23:51:46 UTC <shayruldawn> @AidenWolfe Damned good point
960299291364548610 2018-02-04 23:49:27 UTC <shayruldawn> @Fydsy And Lamela's dive was the most obvious of the match. Hell, the most obvious of the season.
960272188850032642 2018-02-04 22:01:45 UTC <shayruldawn> @Fydsy Today was super-concerning
960226688889229314 2018-02-04 19:00:57 UTC <shayruldawn> @stardorman By far the most obvious dive of the match
960225857733365761 2018-02-04 18:57:39 UTC <shayruldawn> @ThoseScouseLads That's exactly what I saw. And I'm still pissed off.

960217890984251392 2018-02-04 18:25:59 UTC <shayruldawn> @dary11whittaker That was the worst dive of the day
960217017986048001 2018-02-04 18:22:31 UTC <shayruldawn> Such bullshit.  VVD pulled back to stop from kicking him.
960216742697095170 2018-02-04 18:21:26 UTC <shayruldawn> So fucking bogus

960130357440983040 2018-02-04 12:38:10 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump The media has reported your ratings are up slightly. It's just not the big deal you think it is.

First time found it on closet floor. No such luck second time. It irks me that it cost so much but such poor workmanship. Now I just wear a plain band.

959422119040995329 2018-02-02 13:43:53 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump The FBI and Justice Dept is working for this country.  Something you should respect instead of this partisan crap.

959090475776045057 2018-02-01 15:46:03 UTC <shayruldawn> @dumbbeezie Reminds me of a friend's grandmother years ago who said, I don't know what the big deal is about the f word, everybody farts.
959084190036824064 2018-02-01 15:21:04 UTC <shayruldawn> @omgdadno Interesting. I got a similar message from twitter that bogus accounts I'd followed or RT'd had been deleted. Converse to that reaction, I was appalled that I hadn't been more savvy.

959060697383669760 2018-02-01 13:47:43 UTC <shayruldawn> @peterbakernyt @shearm @ktumulty Since the term DREAMer, a simple acronym, is now such an issue, perhaps we refer to them as "the people covered by the bill first proposed in 2001 and on which Republicans have still refused to act or comprise while watching them all grow up."
959057548899995648 2018-02-01 13:35:12 UTC <shayruldawn> @ADIC33 @cobaltcoqui That's my thought ... But the possibility is there

958914130139860992 2018-01-31 04:05:19 UTC <shayruldawn> Democrats need to be on every camera, every news show, every social media page, letting it be known the GOP Congress has become lawless, and constantly enumerating their infractions.

958856443821805568 2018-01-31 00:16:05 UTC <shayruldawn> The real conspiracy of the day is extreme right wingers trying to convince their base that Trump's speech last night was unifying and powerful.
958769147290234881 2018-01-31 18:29:12 UTC <shayruldawn> Well this puts it in a different perspective, and I hope the injured are okay ... But the irony persists.https://twitter.com/CBSEveningNews/status/958768356563316736

958542711451156482 2018-01-30 03:29:25 UTC <shayruldawn> Okay this whole speech has been story after story and trotting out numerous, sweet, heroic people. Too many anecdotes.  Not enough substance. This must be the tactic for keeping him on script.

958531493906788352 2018-01-30 02:44:51 UTC <shayruldawn> @HoarseWisperer And Mercedes has a plant in Tuscaloosa. And VW has a plant in Chattanooga.  And Kia has a plant in LaGrange Ga. He's an idiot.
958529233265053699 2018-01-30 02:35:52 UTC <shayruldawn> Trump on veterans is nothing but lip service
958527495585837059 2018-01-30 02:28:58 UTC <shayruldawn> Trump and GOP continue to LIE that people who couldn't afford health insurance were forced to buy or pay penalties. Not true. The exemption covers several hardships, including,  "I can't afford it."

958452734923038720 2018-01-30 21:31:53 UTC <shayruldawn> @Brimshack You're correct. They did it to me when I ran for a local superior court job in 2005. An office manager in a small town and they painted me as a communist. I have been unwilling to forgive that.
958448359181897728 2018-01-30 21:14:30 UTC <shayruldawn> @Sennesation I saw that too. The kid was really caught up in the moment.

953996317231140865 2018-01-18 14:23:41 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump How magnanimous of you
953993553138585600 2018-01-18 14:12:42 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump CHIP should be permanent.  But it should not be a bargaining CHIP. Do the right thing.  Tell Congress to authorize and fund CHIP without all the b.s.
953978864103051264 2018-01-18 13:14:19 UTC <shayruldawn> See you in Chattanooga!https://twitter.com/womensmarch/status/953820698660745216

953636520384258049 2018-01-17 14:33:58 UTC <shayruldawn> @LouiseLacy So sorry.  Hope you feel better soon.

953084376501374978 2018-01-15 01:59:57 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump You're the one who doesn't want a deal or you'd stop tweeting bullshit and work on a deal instead of golfing.
953083724454944771 2018-01-15 01:57:22 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump DACA had nothing to do with the military and why would you try to twist them together?
953077977927114752 2018-01-15 01:34:31 UTC <shayruldawn> @BillKristol I agree. Almost every day he tweets insults at Democrats. This is not a man who wants to work towards bipartisan deals. He thinks he can  bully Democrats into submission.

951796520382291974 2018-01-12 12:42:28 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump Stop saying Democrats don't care about life & safety. DACA are young men & women just trying to live their lives, safely. DACA should not be bargaining chip for military. So http://STFU.You just signed 4B for missile defense and we already have largest military in world.

951471148524503041 2018-01-11 15:09:33 UTC <shayruldawn> @funder And they are still waiting approval on the joint venture and even then production won't start until 2021.
951467147812773888 2018-01-11 14:53:40 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump It is good news - in three or four years, and if the joint venture is approved.
951462810273402880 2018-01-11 14:36:25 UTC <shayruldawn> We knew the GOP and Trump sabotaged ACA enrollment by cutting enrollment resources, dates and information. But they underhandedly cut protections too. Shame on the GOP.  You're busted.

951147577034117120 2018-01-10 17:43:48 UTC <shayruldawn> Trump started that cabinet meeting by saying the media can't survive without him. As if there was no media before he was president.
951145065682006019 2018-01-10 17:33:49 UTC <shayruldawn> So 45 says "you can't say things that are knowingly false." Well... Ahem.
951134917999685632 2018-01-10 16:53:30 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump There is a reason we have a Judicial Branch of government.  It's called Checks and Balances.

951074335078395904 2018-01-10 12:52:46 UTC <shayruldawn> @CBSNews @brandon_r_horan Why require them to be schooled at all?  Already conservatives seem to favor putting them to work instead of feeding them.

949637482517352448 2018-01-06 13:43:13 UTC <shayruldawn> @kurteichenwald Omg! I knew was something budgeted or planned outside the tax bill because big corporations don't make sudden decisions. But that didn't occur to me!
949635364095963136 2018-01-06 13:34:48 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump If you were very smart, you wouldn't be on Twitter with all this bullshit.
949629587234881536 2018-01-06 13:11:51 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump No hoax. If anything, the proof continues to mount that a whole lot of your people knew about it.

949387933454426113 2018-01-05 21:11:36 UTC <shayruldawn> @thehill @nalapenny I thought that too. Often the issues GOP argues exist in these programs are because they underfund/understaff them in the first place.

949270299404656646 2018-01-05 13:24:10 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump @dianasoletti @BirdofGay I'm seriously considering cashing some of mine out and remodeling my kitchen before I lose half of it. At least then I can go into retirement with a dishwasher.
949267164695093248 2018-01-05 13:11:43 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump @dianasoletti The top 10% doesn't understand this is a gamble for us with everything we have. This meteoric rise is not comfortable. It's scary as hell.
949264191063552000 2018-01-05 12:59:54 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump @dianasoletti Or, we only are invested as far as our modest 401K plans and can't actually take advantage of current gains, so when the market crashes again, so goes our 401K.

948894449563774977 2018-01-04 12:30:41 UTC <shayruldawn> @InSpiteOfTrump Hard to believe many GOP lawmakers are hesitant as they've crowed for years about wanting deep cuts in the safety net.

948365784719511559 2018-01-02 01:29:57 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump Does no one in your family, your cabinet, your staff or the spineless Republican Party have the guts to insist that you shut the fuck up? Most of us don't want a war with NK just so you can stroke your button.
948315690523652096 2018-01-02 22:10:54 UTC <shayruldawn> @hunterw So this means many MOC have  been spending quite a lot of our time on his golf courses as well.  This is worse than we thought.
948314962291765248 2018-01-02 22:08:00 UTC <shayruldawn> @kurteichenwald @showusyourwork The obvious answer is yes.  The pic is unnecessary as the forest is rife with felled trees (also obvious to even the most casual and barely observant hiker.)
948288824836280322 2018-01-02 20:24:08 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump A president shouldn't be making foreign policy statements on social media. Ever. Period.
948288603393789952 2018-01-02 20:23:16 UTC <shayruldawn> @kurteichenwald A president shouldn't be making foreign policy statements on social media. Ever.

948256008043933696 2018-01-02 18:13:44 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump Because blaming Democrats is all you've got. And it worked so well for you last year in your quest to bring us all together.

943901886498910209 2017-12-21 17:52:01 UTC <shayruldawn> For the vice president to say that a president with approval ratings in the mid-30s has spurred record-setting optimism in this country is nothing but pure ass licking.

941064736548032513 2017-12-13 21:58:11 UTC <shayruldawn> @crlfc74 I thought the yellow was to our player when the ref sent him back to spot the ball closer to the corner after the tussle with the ball boy.
941064043007217667 2017-12-13 21:55:26 UTC <shayruldawn> @BenWebbLFC And dry as hell
941063782029197318 2017-12-13 21:54:24 UTC <shayruldawn> @crlfc74 And what was with that stupid ball boy and then the ref gives a yellow for no damn reason?  Very frustrating all round.

939490200044081152 2017-12-09 13:41:33 UTC <shayruldawn> After a thought, compared to interest rates, $200 is a large return. But yeah, most of us, including me, don't have $15K collecting dust.
939488480882839552 2017-12-09 13:34:43 UTC <shayruldawn> @YoungyLFC_98 I noticed that too and had the same reaction.  We should have our minds on this match.

916439472887222272 2017-10-06 23:06:11 UTC <shayruldawn> @Scavino45 @DEVIL_in_daSKYZ Does it matter? It bears Trump's name, therefore it's his responsibility and damaging nonetheless.
916437959603294208 2017-10-06 23:00:10 UTC <shayruldawn> @tribelaw I hate how he thinks it's okay to try and joke around about serious stuff.  Some stuff just ain't funny!

915176596428017664 2017-10-03 11:27:58 UTC <shayruldawn> @JoyAnnReid I have same thought. I try not to judge. But we didn't hear that during the campaign, and suddenly we hear it from Trump, Pence and Sanders.

911226300337197056 2017-09-22 13:50:54 UTC <shayruldawn> @RedRamble So sorry for your loss.     Our vet sent a sweet card too. Grateful we have sweet people to take of our furbabies and us too.
911223560752033792 2017-09-22 13:40:01 UTC <shayruldawn> @Fydsy If they had a microphone, I would've been up there singing Misty with them.
911223090461409280 2017-09-22 13:38:09 UTC <shayruldawn> @amvetsupport It is noted that they don't give a shit what the rules are or should be.

911208343879995393 2017-09-22 12:39:33 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump You can keep saying that, but it will never be true.

910968944877559808 2017-09-21 20:48:16 UTC <shayruldawn> @AntonioArellano I don't see any proof other than Trump saying it though.
910968648348651520 2017-09-21 20:47:05 UTC <shayruldawn> @ABC Is there any proof of this other than Trump saying it?
910968024898908160 2017-09-21 20:44:36 UTC <shayruldawn> Dammit.  I said I didn't care... and now find that I do care.

910492536644538368 2017-09-20 13:15:11 UTC <shayruldawn> @POTUS @Franklin_Graham I pray he can act like an adult, he learns pompous insults to other leaders aren't helpful, he stops campaigning long enough to be president

910333476066426880 2017-09-19 02:43:08 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump @BigIndianGyasi I would agree except it's indicative of his disregard for respect and decorum and diplomacy. He treats it like a joke.

908866578812456960 2017-09-15 01:34:12 UTC <shayruldawn> @POTUS @amvetsupport @MaryKeithBare1 This is why messaging & communication continue to be one of biggest failures of this admin. And there is really only 1 person to blame.
908865452339757058 2017-09-15 01:29:44 UTC <shayruldawn> @POTUS @amvetsupport @MaryKeithBare1 And yet, we saw Spicer and now Sanders repeatedly using the phrases "I think" and "I believe."  What Sanders thinks carries no authority.

891400948345688065 2017-07-29 20:52:02 UTC <shayruldawn> @AngrierWHStaff Trump will never succeed by acting "versus" someone or something. The essence of politics is common ground and compromise.

845378046286815232 2017-03-24 20:53:27 UTC <shayruldawn> The President on TV continuing to moan about "Obamacare" is not productive. Shut up and actually show us something better.
845377616576163840 2017-03-24 20:51:44 UTC <shayruldawn> Healthcare providers would not have bailed from the marketplace had the GOP supported making the ACA work.
845377362514640896 2017-03-24 20:50:44 UTC <shayruldawn> The Affordable Care Act is not exploding. It was based on the market cooperating and the government aiding market through its early years.
845376849148612608 2017-03-24 20:48:41 UTC <shayruldawn> Republicans didn't have enough of their own votes to pass their bill. This is proof it was the wrong bill.
845376590217400325 2017-03-24 20:47:40 UTC <shayruldawn> The ACA could have been improved into a great program except that the GOP did everything in their power to make it not work.
845376123148144640 2017-03-24 20:45:48 UTC <shayruldawn> How completely expected that Trump blames the GOP's inability to build consensus on a bad bill on Democrats.

788917048642572288 2016-10-19 01:37:36 UTC <shayruldawn> @1Saloni he schooled Nevadans on how to say Nevada, but then he pronounced hombres as hambre.  That's all I'm saying.

786597656004931585 2016-10-13 16:01:10 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump where exactly has she been for 30 years?

786525879073660928 2016-10-13 11:15:57 UTC <shayruldawn> Funny, the only account on my timeline defending Trump is "promoted." And I see it several times a day. Go ahead and spend that money!
786525088984158210 2016-10-13 11:12:48 UTC <shayruldawn> @cindynorth1 so again, give her support, but don't jump to any conclusions.  Even the idea that it's wrongdoing is hurtful and damaging.
786524757881520128 2016-10-13 11:11:29 UTC <shayruldawn> @cindynorth1 I have close family friends with a child was killed and it WAS the husband (he's in jail.). Years later it's still traumatic
786524172105183232 2016-10-13 11:09:10 UTC <shayruldawn> @cindynorth1 just saw this sad/horrible story. I say don't jump to conclusions. Let investigators worry about the facts. Just be her friend.

746028913604780037 2016-06-23 17:15:28 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil I'm not getting the crying part.
746028292025683968 2016-06-23 17:13:00 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil Nope I'm not on the wrong side. But thanks for asking :) But for the record, I don't think govt should control everything.
746027493132382208 2016-06-23 17:09:49 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil They did introduce leg. The sit-in was to try to force a vote on it. The speaker held votes on everything else.
746025208817950720 2016-06-23 17:00:44 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil I appreciate the discussion. And thank you for your service too. I haven't argued with a veteran since ... erm.. last night :)
746023733098225664 2016-06-23 16:54:53 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil thats the saddest truth of all.
746023658036944896 2016-06-23 16:54:35 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil This and other issues will require bipartisan cooperation, which has been sadly lacking. Both sides have to grow up.
746022528443785216 2016-06-23 16:50:05 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil It worked didn't it? It made the news. People are talking about it.
746022131146756096 2016-06-23 16:48:31 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil How does my willingness to submit to background checks, waiting periods and registration make me a hypocrite?
746021223922958336 2016-06-23 16:44:54 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil It's not about taking guns away. It's about finding solutions to a growing problem. Reasonable people can seek that dialog.
746019182823804929 2016-06-23 16:36:48 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil I'm not unarmed.
746018332818669568 2016-06-23 16:33:25 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil Thats actually a good meme. By I don't think it applies to reasonable measures needed today.
746017907906314240 2016-06-23 16:31:44 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil but that's way outside my  point which is please don't paint Dems as trying to take guns when just seeking reasonable measures

746014322376196096 2016-06-23 16:17:29 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil In this world we live in, I don't consider registration and background checks "infringement."
746009451744923648 2016-06-23 15:58:08 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil both sides need to work together to help the background check systems work, not just say they won't work and do nothing.
745994442096656384 2016-06-23 14:58:29 UTC <shayruldawn> @elvisknievil Respectfully disagree. Dems asking for reasonable background check expansion & #NoFlyNoBuy. Most Americans & gunowners agree.

743451372880826368 2016-06-16 14:33:14 UTC <shayruldawn> @SubBeck Easy to see how one bit of info goes out wrong, everyone picks it up and the next thing you know, a cherry bomb is a hand grenade.
743450871757930496 2016-06-16 14:31:15 UTC <shayruldawn> @SubBeck Still, IMO, a rifle like that shouldn't have less restrictions than a handgun.
743450558317662211 2016-06-16 14:30:00 UTC <shayruldawn> @SubBeck There is a problem, not just with media, but also lawmakers, in defining types of weapons.
743449988257067008 2016-06-16 14:27:44 UTC <shayruldawn> @SubBeck I agree it was inaccurate. In fact, I now know that the Sig Sauer is more powerful, faster, etc. than the AR-15.

710954776956162048 2016-03-18 22:23:22 UTC <shayruldawn> @darth @Liverpotlian kinda ridiculous that @realDonaldTrump is still moaning and complaining about  @megynkelly #growup
710953871879880705 2016-03-18 22:19:46 UTC <shayruldawn> @realDonaldTrump  Get over it! Act like you're more than 12 yrs old. @megynkelly isn't the problem.

709915303451488256 2016-03-15 01:32:52 UTC <shayruldawn> @endywood IKR!  It's bad enough listening to someone talk about it
709912848877658112 2016-03-15 01:23:07 UTC <shayruldawn> @endywood to be fair there were also computer programming books, but I had nothing to do with that lol
709911148452298753 2016-03-15 01:16:21 UTC <shayruldawn> I order new sandals and, inspired by my browsing history, the website shows me a huge selection of Liverpool FC shirts and pearl earrings.

709893444152516608 2016-03-15 00:06:00 UTC <shayruldawn> @RickBasini and I'm not surprised how it's turning out
709892385300471809 2016-03-15 00:01:48 UTC <shayruldawn> @RickBasini one can never tell how long it will take to count Florida votes, though can they?  lol ;)
709890422135529473 2016-03-15 23:54:00 UTC <shayruldawn> I also tell myself my fantasy football is performing so badly because I researched too much. Total bullshit, but, whatever.
709889995352510464 2016-03-15 23:52:18 UTC <shayruldawn> @RickBasini It's gonna be a long night.  :)
709889870383214593 2016-03-15 23:51:48 UTC <shayruldawn> I actually told myself I didn't have time to do a bracket because I'm too busy keeping my fantasy football team out of the dumpster.
709889616279703552 2016-03-15 23:50:48 UTC <shayruldawn> Last year was first year I didn't do #MarchMadness bracket.The team I ALWAYS pick won it all. That worked so well for me I'm doing it again.

709193506632302592 2016-03-13 01:44:42 UTC <shayruldawn> @Fydsy I'm more worried about the prior non voters he has attracted.  Those people are driving up the primary numbers.
709168984923447297 2016-03-13 00:07:16 UTC <shayruldawn> @Fydsy and some of us know, DT can't give angry America the jobs they've lost. Technology is restructuring our economy. It will get angrier.
709168048146616321 2016-03-13 00:03:33 UTC <shayruldawn> @Fydsy This will only get worse. The media in this country is also disastrously out of line. He thrives on their free PR even the horrendous
709160961907810304 2016-03-13 23:35:23 UTC <shayruldawn> @Fydsy you know, I don't even know why I'm even surprised anymore. Add classic narcissistic sociopath.

708477778304303104 2016-03-11 02:20:39 UTC <shayruldawn> Amazing listening to Fox News use code words & descriptions to blame this situation on the protesters. Trump stoked these flames himself.
