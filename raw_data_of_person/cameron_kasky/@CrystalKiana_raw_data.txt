951635442453172224 2018-01-11 02:02:24 UTC <CrystalKiana> @KayleesiTweets Anne described them as "faux male allies" could we go back to that? The evidence is there. I know these people exist. But I am so sick of the stigma that feminists have as man haters. We can't do this alone, we do need them as a part of the conversation. Let's not shut them out.
