Also Denis Villeneuve instead of Jordan Peele for Best Director, and The Darkest Hour + The Post are average Oscar-bait movies

I have my first exam tomorrow, if he makes the same joke, Ill probably throw a brick at him. Not kidding!

828497668292935680 2017-02-05 06:56:51 UTC <alardel98> The series's absolutely amazing and its one of Netflix's best hit-shows but people were pretty overhyped about it and that made things worse

761917515505205248 2016-08-06 13:31:06 UTC <alardel98> Forgot to mention that all the praise comes straight from the Spanish media, especially the government TV channels.
761916558994202624 2016-08-06 13:27:18 UTC <alardel98> As always, NBC's there wanting to impose English over Portuguese, even tho the Olympics are being held in Brazil, just to get more viewers

746286052369907713 2016-06-24 10:17:14 UTC <alardel98> What an eventful day. Last day of school, UK leaves the EU, David Cameron resigns, exams over..
746014210543456257 2016-06-23 16:17:02 UTC <alardel98> @realDonaldTrump ''Trump's campaign doesn't get any donations, unlike crooked Hillary'' -Meanwhile- *charging 35 buck for a fuckin' t-shirt*
745929734056513536 2016-06-23 10:41:21 UTC <alardel98> And if you think immigration is the problem, look at Germany. Higher population density than the UK and still taking in refugees.
745929381923676160 2016-06-23 10:39:58 UTC <alardel98> Many countries in the EU (Germany, Czech Republic..) have lower unemployment rates than the UK.
745928840443203585 2016-06-23 10:37:48 UTC <alardel98> On top of that, there's been many corruption cases in these countries's governments in the last couple of years.
745928262203891713 2016-06-23 10:35:31 UTC <alardel98> They had a really similar unemployment rate to the one they have now (21%). The same thing happened to France and Italy.
745927972163588097 2016-06-23 10:34:21 UTC <alardel98> These countries's politicians are the main ones to blame. E.g. Spain went into a recession in the 90's, before joining the Euro.
745926219699470336 2016-06-23 10:27:24 UTC <alardel98> Those countries's youth unemployment has nothing to do with being a member state of the EU.
745925481854341124 2016-06-23 10:24:28 UTC <alardel98> If people #VoteLeave it'd be more difficult for young people from those countries to come to the UK and get a job

731585949176606720 2016-05-14 20:44:17 UTC <alardel98> Malta's song is complete cringeworthiness
731583439217004544 2016-05-14 20:34:18 UTC <alardel98> Vale, la cancin de Espaa ha estado bien, seamos sinceros. Pero el efecto que han puesto al final deja mucho que desear #Eurovision
731578324326219776 2016-05-14 20:13:59 UTC <alardel98> I just had a seizure while watching Serbia's song. I'm going to the toilet now. Good timing. Thanks. #Eurovision
731576842193375232 2016-05-14 20:08:05 UTC <alardel98> Australia's songs AMAZING. Shame it's not in Europe, they would get more votes if they did. I have a feeling they'll come either 1st or 2nd
