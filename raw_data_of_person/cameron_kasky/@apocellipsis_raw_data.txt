970733310212296705 2018-03-05 18:50:31 UTC <apocellipsis> @JamesGunn I've made this point elsewhere, but still It's beyond surreal living with a president that is gift wrapping the country for a hostile foreign agent and one of the two controlling parties at best is trying to justify it and at worst enable it.
970494366790938624 2018-03-04 03:01:02 UTC <apocellipsis> @AshaRangappa_ It's beyond surreal living with a president that is gift wrapping the country for a hostile foreign agent and one of the two controlling parties at best is trying to justify it and at worst enable it. More so when the other party is too afraid to show the outrage it deserves.
969252919378923520 2018-03-01 16:47:58 UTC <apocellipsis> @krassenstein Sad, highly unethical, and illegal.
969251983893901312 2018-03-01 16:44:15 UTC <apocellipsis> What the actual fuck? No money for supplies, no money for raises, all the money for guns they don't want or need.https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/968862717946757132
968945901199937536 2018-02-28 20:27:59 UTC <apocellipsis> @Acosta So... That's a no?
968597481117421568 2018-02-27 21:23:29 UTC <apocellipsis> @HamillHimself Had to hit me in the feels, didn't you Hamill?
968577519036387328 2018-02-27 20:04:10 UTC <apocellipsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr @davidhogg111 @gandsleonard Though I would like to direct you to any number of republican fundraising initiatives, because the only excuse for the rhetoric they are spewing is fear.
968577169193623552 2018-02-27 20:02:47 UTC <apocellipsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr @davidhogg111 @gandsleonard Hey Shirley, hope your having a great day. You see we may disagree on politics, but I'm going to avoid making any assumptions about your political affiliations, and just say thank you for offering your feedback. Personally I don't believe in party politics.
968554845299978240 2018-02-27 18:34:04 UTC <apocellipsis> Any time I want to remind myself that the @GOP is beyond redemption, I listen to @SpeakerRyan. No conscience, no empathy, no real desire to improve this country. This guy is the smug faced manifestation of an Ayn rand dystopia. #derelictionofduty #GunReform

968503236666757121 2018-02-27 15:09:00 UTC <apocellipsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr @davidhogg111 *fighting, really need an edit function.
968503080928063488 2018-02-27 15:08:23 UTC <apocellipsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr @davidhogg111 The truth is, they are afraid. Afraid of you, what you stand for, the change you can bring. But most of all they are afraid of losing power and will scratch and claw in every way possible to hold onto it. Keep fighter, their fear shows your making progress.
968280136377339905 2018-02-26 00:22:28 UTC <apocellipsis> @GOP @GreenvilleNews @LindseyGrahamSC @oufenix Thank you, but unfortunately it takes $7,400 for him to listen, the amount the NRA contributed in his last campaign.
968250067751718913 2018-02-26 22:23:00 UTC <apocellipsis> @GreenvilleNews @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey, look, you and I aren't usually on in agreement on the issues. Though I think you'd be surprised on the middle ground we'd. I have even actively defended you because I thought you maybe, just maybe could act like the republicans of old and do what's right for the country.
968247657180401664 2018-02-26 22:13:25 UTC <apocellipsis> @realDonaldTrump @david_js_ @Fahrenthold @beezers52 And republicans would act morally superior. Seems they've forgotten all that morality though.
968238361684168705 2018-02-26 21:36:29 UTC <apocellipsis> This is exactly why people can't take republicans seriously. @CaseyCagle should be held accountable.
968237707787931648 2018-02-26 21:33:53 UTC <apocellipsis> Any comment on the massive ethics violation here? @Georgia_AG Is this really something you want to back and or refuse to even recognize.
968236109389066242 2018-02-26 21:27:32 UTC <apocellipsis> @williamlegate @PattyArquette Republican logic: basic needs like healthcare and education = entitlements. Discounts for their gun fetish group = a right. Pure insanity. BTW the wife loved the shit out of Medium.
968218457958469632 2018-02-26 20:17:23 UTC <apocellipsis> @NateWatkins @PoliticalEmilia Not to mention, these kids can actually read.

968201951065329665 2018-02-26 19:11:48 UTC <apocellipsis> @williamlegate What do they care? They're not even citizens until birth. Just not damn illegals trying to sneak their way in. #prolifeuntilbirth #fakechristians
968194718445244417 2018-02-26 18:43:03 UTC <apocellipsis> Only looking to hit that afterlife, you really don't care what kind of world you leave behind. Before you go blaming single mothers, the youth, or any number of the things that allow you to shirk all responsibility, look in a fucking mirror. #Hypocrites #FakeChristian
968194275958771713 2018-02-26 18:41:18 UTC <apocellipsis> I was raised in the church, but "Christians" like you are one of the reasons I no longer believe in a god. How can any supreme being be ok with the horrific shit you claim in their name. How can so called "Christians" have zero empathy for the world around them.
968191353145430017 2018-02-26 18:29:41 UTC <apocellipsis> It's not like we have a corrupt adulterer in the white house or anything. No, has to be those single mothers with no family values conservatives don't actually give a shit about unless it scores them votes. #Parkland #FakeChristian
968190328661528588 2018-02-26 18:25:37 UTC <apocellipsis> Maybe the problem isn't because of single mothers. Maybe it's hypocritical "Christians" like @RickSantorum who don't resemble anything close to followers of Christ and don't believe in practicing what they preach. But what do I know, I'm just one of those damned immoral atheists.
968160701578731522 2018-02-26 16:27:53 UTC <apocellipsis> @jaketapper Of course @realDonaldTrump us going to take advantage of this tragedy. Probably feels they owe him for making him miss a day of golf.
967573712424919040 2018-02-24 01:35:24 UTC <apocellipsis> @williamlegate This. These people claim the generations after them have no morals, but their world is so steeped in cynicism that concepts like compassion and empathy are foreign and suspicious. They would rather believe in conspiracy theories.
965784771874951168 2018-02-19 03:06:47 UTC <apocellipsis> @realDonaldTrump Does it include the parts where you cheat on your wife, mock the disabled, assault pageant contestants, obstruct justice, lie every other word or use the deaths of 17 people to push your own Russia narrative? #TrumpColluded #FakePresident #Impeach45
965716485242085378 2018-02-19 22:35:26 UTC <apocellipsis> This motherfucker. I show up to work late, I'm still going to be in trouble, even if I point out someone else was late the day before. Who gives a shit what Obama did or didn't do when you have the power to do something now. #fakepresident #drumpf #RussianSanctions #Impeach45https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/965676314576543744
964654071742369793 2018-02-16 00:13:47 UTC <apocellipsis> @realDonaldTrump Spending the weekend at Mar-a-lago? While parents are burying their children, you're using their deaths to take another vacation. @GOP You are complicit. #Parkland #parklandstrong #ParklandShooting
