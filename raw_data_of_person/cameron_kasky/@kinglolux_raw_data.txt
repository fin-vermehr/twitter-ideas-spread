968579381768503296 2018-02-27 20:11:34 UTC <kinglolux> @brittanydude Right. So many people say one thing and act another. I think "casual hookups" are immediately so oxymoronic because, even if you just want some action, it's hard to divorce that part of our mind and heart. It's sort of just selfish, to keep your options open. Cowardly, even.
968577994234126336 2018-02-27 20:06:03 UTC <kinglolux> @brittanydude No it makes sense. It's a hard thing to establish. Once asked a girl out, maybe 9 years ago. She'd been in a 5 year rel. that just ended and she said "I've never been asked on a date." So like, she'd been on dates, just not asked on one? IDK.
968577684241465344 2018-02-27 20:04:49 UTC <kinglolux> @brwalle Makes sense. I wonder if sometimes the idea of a date is so different for some people. Like saying "let's meet for a drink" isn't good enough. Or they want you to use the word "date." Or guys are afraid if they ask you on a "date" they can't ghost you.
968577423699668993 2018-02-27 20:03:47 UTC <kinglolux> @SBentley88 That's a good gauge.
968568669977497600 2018-02-27 19:29:00 UTC <kinglolux> So many of these kids (20-23 y.o.) that I'm casting all day say that they've never been on a "date." What does "date" mean to you? Yes, YOU. Is it a meet up for a drink? Is it a formal "Do you want to have dinner or see a movie with me?" When does it BECOME a true "date?"

956002219114905600 2018-01-23 03:14:25 UTC <kinglolux> Maybe the Kings are allergic to the first goal?
955987516645031938 2018-01-23 02:16:00 UTC <kinglolux> White supremacist: HBCUs are segregation against whites!  Fact: HBCUs aren't black only. More than 1/5th of HBCU students are non-black. And they were created because of segregation against blacks in the fucking first place, dickhead.

Just for instance, if you've seen the movie, how does the main character save himself? He pick stuffing from the armrest of the chair to plug his ears. He LITERALLY saves himself by picking cotton.

936773380119736321 2017-12-01 01:45:52 UTC <kinglolux> @alex_faust @aussiemily @martini__shot Ice has seen tilted most of this period. Hopefully this isn't the two-goal lead effect.
936772738827431936 2017-12-01 01:43:19 UTC <kinglolux> Just curious, why is boy wonder and terrible deal-maker Jared Kushner responsible for anything important for our country at all? I wouldn't trust him to leave a fucking tip.

935745963817361410 2017-11-28 05:43:17 UTC <kinglolux> In the first scene, Lisa's friend was all "It's terrible you're having an affair!" and now she's all "You guys are hilarious with your affair!" #TheRoom #TheDisasterArtist
935745673139576832 2017-11-28 05:42:08 UTC <kinglolux> 70 minutes in and we're at sex scene number six. No wait, it got interrupted by other blond woman! Oh snap! XYZ! #TheRoom #TheDisasterArtist
935745359892111360 2017-11-28 05:40:53 UTC <kinglolux> This movie is clearly about how Mark and Johnny are in love with each other but Lisa is getting in the way of their love. #TheRoom #TheDisasterArtist

935743061707149318 2017-11-28 05:31:45 UTC <kinglolux> Mark almost threw Peter off the roof and now they're bros again. Five seconds later. #TheRoom #TheDisasterArtist
935742911811063809 2017-11-28 05:31:10 UTC <kinglolux> I figured it out. Tommy Wiseau is actually a ten year-old in a 50 year-old's body. #TheRoom #TheDisasterArtist
935742638426386433 2017-11-28 05:30:04 UTC <kinglolux> Tommy Wiseau doesn't know the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist. #TheRoom #TheDisasterArtist

935689171728924672 2017-11-28 01:57:37 UTC <kinglolux> Dear god, Kings. WTF are you doing on this PP?
935688937300824064 2017-11-28 01:56:41 UTC <kinglolux> @brittanydude Do they take euros? I have a bunch leftover.
935687853215850496 2017-11-28 01:52:23 UTC <kinglolux> Kings sure are helping Howard's save %
935687661737590784 2017-11-28 01:51:37 UTC <kinglolux> Kings can't buy a goal.
935687523438944258 2017-11-28 01:51:04 UTC <kinglolux> C'mon Kopi, wtf was that?
935687182592851968 2017-11-28 01:49:43 UTC <kinglolux> Doughty immediately loses the zone on the PP after a clean faceoff win. That's this season.

935680753664368640 2017-11-28 01:24:10 UTC <kinglolux> Howard sucks. Let's make him look that way.
935680476806709248 2017-11-28 01:23:04 UTC <kinglolux> @LAKings @brittanydude I'd pay to see you do that.

924389538629324807 2017-10-28 21:36:54 UTC <kinglolux> And now my Twitter is private. Can't take any more Astros fans telling me why I'm upset. I'M UPSET BECAUSE I'M ASIAN & RACISM IS FUCKED UP.
924388614703800320 2017-10-28 21:33:14 UTC <kinglolux> @darrenrovell @Bray_Milus Is it the program that Gurriel is taking for racial sensitivity?
924388380795854849 2017-10-28 21:32:18 UTC <kinglolux> @MLBONFOX @Dodgers @astros @MLB @PenMark23 Cool. Punish him too.
924386385020063744 2017-10-28 21:24:23 UTC <kinglolux> @darrenrovell Better donate that to an Asian organization.
924380686353555456 2017-10-28 21:01:44 UTC <kinglolux> @MLB I'd rather @mlb not suspend Gurriel at all than parse how racist he was by differentiating severity with playoffs vs reg season gms.
924379775468048384 2017-10-28 20:58:07 UTC <kinglolux> How racist was what Gurriel did? Like "5 reg. season games" racist I'd say. Let's check the sliding scale of racial epithets... #RobManfred
924379359686754304 2017-10-28 20:56:28 UTC <kinglolux> @MLB God forbid Gurriel get punished during the World Series for something he did during the World Series. @mlb #RobManfred
924375482480467968 2017-10-28 20:41:03 UTC <kinglolux> @MLB @mlb Because baseball is more important than racism.https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/yuli-gurriel-suspended-five-regular-season-games-for-racist-gesture-in-game-3/
924347209516179457 2017-10-28 18:48:42 UTC <kinglolux> I assume if there was anything Earth shattering in the JFK files, we'd know by now, right?
924342196114878465 2017-10-28 18:28:47 UTC <kinglolux> I would really be shocked if you told me the most popular Halloween costume the past 2 years wasn't Harley Quinn.
924312723134988289 2017-10-28 16:31:40 UTC <kinglolux> What's worse: my bias for LA making me angrier about racism? Or your bias for Houston making you ignore it?
924311798899032066 2017-10-28 16:28:00 UTC <kinglolux> @bizniz98 How did he learn? He learned not to get caught? He didn't learn shit.
924160463436255232 2017-10-27 06:26:39 UTC <kinglolux> But Darvish isn't Chinese. Wouldn't it be racist if I "affectionately" called a Colombian "Little Mexican?" 2/2
924160187518218240 2017-10-27 06:25:33 UTC <kinglolux> For people saying "chinito" isn't a racial slur; from what I understand, it means "little Chinese (person)." Racist? Maybe not in itself 1/2
924157897352683520 2017-10-27 06:16:27 UTC <kinglolux> Prime Time racism, shoved into my living room while the racists are lauded for their athletic prowess. @MLB @Buck #Gurriel
924157362763476992 2017-10-27 06:14:19 UTC <kinglolux> I have to sit here in my living room and listen to @Buck sing Gurriel praises while he makes racist gestures. @MLB It disgusts me.
924156668119678977 2017-10-27 06:11:34 UTC <kinglolux> Not entirely sure why this #Gurriel shit has me so irked. B/c I'm a LA fan? Nah take the Series, don't care. It's seeing that shit on my TV.
924156286907834368 2017-10-27 06:10:03 UTC <kinglolux> I'M FUCKING PISSED.

924150223512920064 2017-10-27 05:45:57 UTC <kinglolux> @MLB Anybody remember kids singing "Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees, what are these?" #gurriel @mlbpic.twitter.com/UqHu0YwPfl
924149839515881472 2017-10-27 05:44:26 UTC <kinglolux> @MLB Kids would do this gesture while they sang at me in the school bus, "Me Chinese, me play joke, me put pee pee in your Coke." @mlbpic.twitter.com/l6MQNbzAZb
924149352674684929 2017-10-27 05:42:30 UTC <kinglolux> All due respect to Darvish, but #Gurriel wasn't just mocking him, he was mocking Asians. I don't forgive him. Not yet.
924148255847358464 2017-10-27 05:38:08 UTC <kinglolux> Hahahaha! You played in Japan which means YOU SHOULD FUCKING KNOW BETTER.https://twitter.com/BrentZwerneman/status/924137060113485824
924147912841424897 2017-10-27 05:36:46 UTC <kinglolux> I mean, Darvish got knocked around tonight and fans are rallying around him. I do love this team and our fans. Humans over baseball.
924147598046388224 2017-10-27 05:35:31 UTC <kinglolux> @brwalle Imma let him focus on baseball and express rage for him.
924147444497051648 2017-10-27 05:34:55 UTC <kinglolux> @Ken_Rosenthal Make sure he gives him a stern talking-to. Then we can put this racism aside and get back to what's important; baseball
924147140946944000 2017-10-27 05:33:42 UTC <kinglolux> @brwalle And it's fucking nonsensical! You can't day you didn't realize you did something offensive AND apologize for it. Fucking bullshit.
924146869038489600 2017-10-27 05:32:38 UTC <kinglolux> I appreciate this. But I'm done letting racists off the hook. Asians ain't lying down on that shit anymore. Don't fuck with us.https://twitter.com/faridyu/status/924146590893436928
924146456977649664 2017-10-27 05:30:59 UTC <kinglolux> @brwalle Half-hearted apology because he got caught. I'm really fucking angry right now.
924145153966727168 2017-10-27 05:25:49 UTC <kinglolux> You're sorry you got caught, @el_yuly10, not that you did it.

924143992941436928 2017-10-27 05:21:12 UTC <kinglolux> @ChadMoriyama Well, he "apologized." So he knows he did something wrong. But that apology was bullshit.
924143526048174080 2017-10-27 05:19:21 UTC <kinglolux> "I'm sorry. I meant no disrespect. I didn't even know I did it." THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. YOU DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO!https://twitter.com/michaeljduarte/status/924142796763570176
924142797191462912 2017-10-27 05:16:27 UTC <kinglolux> You know what I need? More white guys telling me I'm overreacting to racism against my race. That would just be splendid.
924142241785851904 2017-10-27 05:14:14 UTC <kinglolux> Can you say the N-word and then say "I didn't mean to offend?" No. And you can't mock an Asian with "slant eyes" and say it either.
924141751715033088 2017-10-27 05:12:17 UTC <kinglolux> You can't do what Gurriel did and say "didn't mean to offend." You did an OFFENSIVE GESTURE. What exactly was your intent???
924140943552364544 2017-10-27 05:09:05 UTC <kinglolux> Don't suspended Gurriel. Make him visit one hundred Texas high schools and speak about racism and take a year of racial sensitivity courses.

924126328000888832 2017-10-27 04:11:00 UTC <kinglolux> @ajrod So, if it was a racist gesture, why are we pumping the brakes on Gurriel? I'm not pumping my brakes on racism.

924124953154224134 2017-10-27 04:05:32 UTC <kinglolux> That one was still off the plate, closer than strike 2, and called a ball. WTF is your zone, ump?

924091084505956352 2017-10-27 01:50:57 UTC <kinglolux> Bellinger swings at those low insides every time. He needs to learn how to spot it and lay off.
924089991663296517 2017-10-27 01:46:37 UTC <kinglolux> Alright, Let's Go Dodgers! Let's get some runs back!

924085895996719104 2017-10-27 01:30:20 UTC <kinglolux> That's totally an out.
924085754443087872 2017-10-27 01:29:47 UTC <kinglolux> One run back.
924085361151586304 2017-10-27 01:28:13 UTC <kinglolux> Even if the Dodgers can't get runs back this inning, this is what they needed.
924083050417238016 2017-10-27 01:19:02 UTC <kinglolux> @sujeeeen @TheRealCoach_H K.
924082843591909377 2017-10-27 01:18:13 UTC <kinglolux> Dodgers need to be patient at the plate, work the count, no easy outs. Get to the pen early too. Only chance.
924082465282473984 2017-10-27 01:16:43 UTC <kinglolux> @itsrealH Yeah, the last game sorta made me wary of the entire bullpen, really.
924082293118943233 2017-10-27 01:16:01 UTC <kinglolux> That was fucking awful. Awful awful awful.
924081418593906688 2017-10-27 01:12:33 UTC <kinglolux> @itsrealH That was brutal.
924081211806441472 2017-10-27 01:11:44 UTC <kinglolux> Darvish looks like smoking hot garbage.
924080998438002688 2017-10-27 01:10:53 UTC <kinglolux> Darvish is trending. That's what we wanted.
924080837489967104 2017-10-27 01:10:14 UTC <kinglolux> That train is annoying.
924080719873191937 2017-10-27 01:09:46 UTC <kinglolux> FUCKIING FUUUCK
924080190845681665 2017-10-27 01:07:40 UTC <kinglolux> We really needed Darvish to have a game for us. Really.
924079874498748417 2017-10-27 01:06:25 UTC <kinglolux> This is demoralizing as fuck.

924077088906264577 2017-10-27 00:55:21 UTC <kinglolux> Dodgers hitters are gonna need to show up tonight.

924076500391026689 2017-10-27 00:53:00 UTC <kinglolux> Fuck.

920124038923431938 2017-10-16 03:07:20 UTC <kinglolux> @WWE My wife (who does not watch wrestling) kindly requests that you cease from using Kurt Angle's music because it annoys her. So, yeah.
920068771313627136 2017-10-16 23:27:43 UTC <kinglolux> I just hope I can do something to change that culture. I really do. I don't want to a match in that fire. #metoo #neveragain
920068418237280256 2017-10-16 23:26:19 UTC <kinglolux> Just because I've never raped, forced myself on a woman, ignored a "no", doesn't mean I'm innocent. Doesn't mean I'm not complicit.
920068131531382784 2017-10-16 23:25:11 UTC <kinglolux> I wonder how much I contributed to this cultural problem we have with sexual assault, harassment, bullying, etc. How much harm did I do?
920067882431668224 2017-10-16 23:24:11 UTC <kinglolux> I wonder if any of the things I did to my female friends, comments about their bodies, what I thought was a playful touch, were traumatic.
920067623626293248 2017-10-16 23:23:10 UTC <kinglolux> I've spent some time today in sadness, thinking about who I was as a boy, teen, young adult. Worried if I ever caused pain, anxiety. #metoo

918200021102686208 2017-10-11 19:41:59 UTC <kinglolux> And can we expect respect for women from an organization that invited President Pussy-Grabber to speak to 40,000 people?
918199620961845248 2017-10-11 19:40:23 UTC <kinglolux> Women are just as capable as men re: the challenges of Scouting. But I don't have confidence in BSA to be as capable to handle it.
918199217494962176 2017-10-11 19:38:47 UTC <kinglolux> Are they prepared to augment their teaching to fit the unique challenges that females encounter in this world? Or even accept they exist?
918199003656871936 2017-10-11 19:37:56 UTC <kinglolux> Are they prepared to tackle the inevitable sexual harassment charges? Are the prepared to teach intergender relations and respect?
918198826329968640 2017-10-11 19:37:14 UTC <kinglolux> I'm against girls in the Boy Scouts. Not because I don't think girls belong, but because I don't think BSA is, ironically, prepared for it.

917969062826790912 2017-10-10 04:24:14 UTC <kinglolux> Even ignoring the constant oppression of minorities in this country, does Mike Ditka know that Jim Crow was like 50 years ago?

915789338578841600 2017-10-04 04:02:47 UTC <kinglolux> Getting Blackmon to chase was huge for Rodney. Could be a whole different inning.
915788339470462977 2017-10-04 03:58:49 UTC <kinglolux> DJ was about an hour late on that one.
915787823877201920 2017-10-04 03:56:46 UTC <kinglolux> Man, Blackmon swung at a garbage pitch.

915785781054025728 2017-10-04 03:48:39 UTC <kinglolux> @brwalle I mean, playoff baseball is just so fucking intense. If anything, I hope these guys just tire each other the fuck out.
915785203892629504 2017-10-04 03:46:21 UTC <kinglolux> Ugh, this is making me all nervous about the next round. #Dodgers
915777788048662528 2017-10-04 03:16:53 UTC <kinglolux> There's nothing sadder than light organ music after your team gives up a homer.
915777538596651008 2017-10-04 03:15:54 UTC <kinglolux> Bradley plated to runs and now gives two up. Whooops.

915752083596251138 2017-10-04 01:34:45 UTC <kinglolux> @random_tangent Yeah, i really hoped he'd fuck some shit up.
915747224809639936 2017-10-04 01:15:26 UTC <kinglolux> @random_tangent Yeah, I switched before it ended. I'm always afraid of changing channels in the middle and missing something.
915743576901828608 2017-10-04 01:00:57 UTC <kinglolux> Oh shit, another spike strip!
915742646030630912 2017-10-04 00:57:15 UTC <kinglolux> Whenever I watch car chases I just always think about what I'd be doing. Take the curb! Ditch that car and steal another!
915741921162571776 2017-10-04 00:54:22 UTC <kinglolux> @random_tangent The chase? Exposition park now. Watching on CBS.

911274549341126656 2017-09-22 17:02:37 UTC <kinglolux> @kayaubrianna Told me they straight up avoid picking up people at the bowl because it's so hard to get there it's not worth their time.
911274291613667330 2017-09-22 17:01:36 UTC <kinglolux> @kayaubrianna And if you decide to Lyft, getting there is easy. Leaving sucks. There's a ride share pickup area, but Lyft/Uber drivers have...
911273540795514880 2017-09-22 16:58:37 UTC <kinglolux> @kayaubrianna Then $6 for a ride to and from the zoo. There are other shuttles around LA that take you to the bowl too.

907452376218353665 2017-09-11 03:54:40 UTC <kinglolux> Braun Strowmn has all the personality and appeal of a sea cucumber. #RAW
907451060783951872 2017-09-11 03:49:27 UTC <kinglolux> Is Emma's gimmick that she wears dark lipstick?
907450388772556800 2017-09-11 03:46:46 UTC <kinglolux> There are some themes that have grating, annoying vocals. ie. The Miz, Randy Orton, Nia Jax. #RAW

907447587115999233 2017-09-11 03:35:38 UTC <kinglolux> Cena vs. Reigns mic spots are killin' it. Both guys are getting over.
907444439248904192 2017-09-11 03:23:08 UTC <kinglolux> It's hard to take Roman Reigns seriously when he dresses like a Punisher Halloween costume.
907130288769187840 2017-09-10 06:34:49 UTC <kinglolux> @Esbee92 And people saying "he apologized right after he said it!" Yeah, he wasn't sorry he said it, he was sorry people heard him.
907129955493879809 2017-09-10 06:33:29 UTC <kinglolux> @Esbee92 Exactly. It doesn't just crop up out of nowhere. It's in his every day vocabulary.
907129750874841088 2017-09-10 06:32:40 UTC <kinglolux> @Esbee92 Ugggghhhhhhhhh.

905993766632165376 2017-09-07 03:18:41 UTC <kinglolux> Kershaw has taken 1/4 of Gray's pitches so far.
905993642904399872 2017-09-07 03:18:11 UTC <kinglolux> Kershaw is making Gray work harder than any of the fucking fielders.
905992944141844480 2017-09-07 03:15:25 UTC <kinglolux> This worked with hockey before; I'll do a shot for every run you win by tonight, #Dodgers.

905991373249159171 2017-09-07 03:09:10 UTC <kinglolux> Jon Gray's facial hair makes me want to punch him in the neck.

905991084811010049 2017-09-07 03:08:01 UTC <kinglolux> Is it "Loo-Croy" or is it how Orel is saying it "La Croix" like the water?
905990478096621568 2017-09-07 03:05:37 UTC <kinglolux> Bless you, Kersh.
905990408332746752 2017-09-07 03:05:20 UTC <kinglolux> I really wish Hershiser would stop singing Kershaw's praises while we're losing so badly.

889906528618070016 2017-07-25 17:53:44 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer that so thoroughly flies in the face of those ideals to speak. (2/2)
889906487832657920 2017-07-25 17:53:35 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer What I am saying is, as an organization that has written laws about the ideals it promotes, it was not right to invite a man (1/2)

889905751732305920 2017-07-25 17:50:39 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer Attacking what he does is different that just not inviting him to speak.

889905052466282498 2017-07-25 17:47:52 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer Dude, it flies in the face of everything the Boy Scouts deign to teach. It sends to conflicting message. That's why it's bad.
889904855493599232 2017-07-25 17:47:05 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer EXACTLY. This was not a place for EITHER message. My point exactly. This was not a place for partisanship.
889904555718082560 2017-07-25 17:45:54 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer I've been to the Jamboree and I listened to George W. Bush and Bill Clinton speak. NEITHER did that. It was not the place or time for it.
889904284174761984 2017-07-25 17:44:49 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer There is a HUGE difference between censorship and not inviting someone to speak in the first place.
889904125189660672 2017-07-25 17:44:11 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer If they wanted that message, they could just tell the kids to watch Fox news or read Breitbart.
889903988002271233 2017-07-25 17:43:39 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer He doesn't exemplify the Scout Law or Oath. And he used his platform to promote himself and his politics, no other president has done that.
889903784490659840 2017-07-25 17:42:50 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer He even joked in his speech about how he was going to fire a current member of his staff.
889903688851914752 2017-07-25 17:42:27 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer It's about letting a man with no respect for the media, opponents and even his own staff talk to boys who are learning to work together.
889903561898905600 2017-07-25 17:41:57 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer It's about letting a man that said "Grab her by the pussy" talk to growing adolescents.
889903467518668800 2017-07-25 17:41:34 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer It's not about censorship, it's about letting a man that denies climate change talk to an organization that is supposed to protect Earth.

887711970517958656 2017-07-19 16:33:21 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer But just because politicians have always lied doesn't mean we stop holding them accountable for it. That would be ignorant.
887711734709895168 2017-07-19 16:32:25 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer And the more we dismiss the stories legitimate media reports on, the more we advance his fake news narrative. Politicians lie, sure.
887710672355639296 2017-07-19 16:28:11 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer But it's important nonetheless.
887710619679379456 2017-07-19 16:27:59 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer It would be a failure to investigate the largest scale hacking into a US election in history. No one said his meeting with Putin was illegal
887710337322991617 2017-07-19 16:26:51 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer It's a fact that Russian intelligence hacked into voting systems during the election. And if that situation isn't fully investigated...
887710336916176897 2017-07-19 16:26:51 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer If the media weren't reporting about all of good interactions with Putin, it would be a disservice to the people.
887709797381840897 2017-07-19 16:24:43 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer It's that he's a bad person with a reputation of misogyny, sexual harassment and racism. It's that he can't be trusted.
887709565331980288 2017-07-19 16:23:47 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer It's that he shoots fast and loose with his mouth about other nations and it hurts the US, which already has a shaky international image.
887709380736450561 2017-07-19 16:23:03 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer It's that he hasn't divested himself from any of the businesses he repeatedly uses his political platforms to promote.
887709180139679744 2017-07-19 16:22:16 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer It's not just that he pissed off the liberal media. It's that every one of his policies is destructive to the middle class.
887573245452365825 2017-07-19 07:22:06 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer 5. And I plan to point out everything that he does that seems fishy because he doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt.
887572989310418947 2017-07-19 07:21:05 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer 4. He's proven himself untrustworthy and it's damning that he would fail to disclose something like this if there was nothing to hide.
887572724473659392 2017-07-19 07:20:02 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer 3. This is a man that would sell this country down the river for magic beans, and everything points to Putin having a hold on him....
887572459590868992 2017-07-19 07:18:59 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer 2. First, he hides something. Then he lies about it. Then he downplays it. Then he gaslights. He did it with Flynn, Manafort, Sessions...
887572079096209408 2017-07-19 07:17:28 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer 1. It's not about them meeting. It's about Trump failing, again, to disclose something important. He has a pattern. .
887570863016394752 2017-07-19 07:12:38 UTC <kinglolux> @ShaneHoopfer You're not President of the United States whom there is a dossier of information that points to the Russian government blackmailing you.
887537505226158080 2017-07-18 05:00:05 UTC <kinglolux> This seems wrong. "Trump had undisclosed hour-long meeting with Putin at G-20 summit http://wapo.st/2ux4K7B?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.ed30754f78bc"

869359748600037376 2017-05-29 01:08:10 UTC <kinglolux> Did Doc just fucking say "shillelaghed???"
869359435117993984 2017-05-29 01:06:55 UTC <kinglolux> After they got on their feet, did his buddies block the bathroom door so they couldn't leave?https://twitter.com/theScoreNHL/status/869359013531574276
869358715127734273 2017-05-29 01:04:04 UTC <kinglolux> @jlock4820 It's annoying as fuck.
869358604360466436 2017-05-29 01:03:37 UTC <kinglolux> Okay, that was just a good goal by the Pens. But I'm not gonna be able to take much more of Pierre's fawning over the Pens.
869358363611611136 2017-05-29 01:02:40 UTC <kinglolux> @NHLonNBCSports actually acknowledge Sid's interference, but call it a good hit.pic.twitter.com/NVhuxISPCu
869357223536803840 2017-05-29 00:58:08 UTC <kinglolux> Looked like interference on Sid behind the net there.
869356535801028608 2017-05-29 00:55:24 UTC <kinglolux> @jlock4820 It's a vuvuzela, it can only make one note!
869355474193326080 2017-05-29 00:51:11 UTC <kinglolux> @britlovesmusic I don't fuck around when it comes to similes.
869355098652065792 2017-05-29 00:49:42 UTC <kinglolux> Like, not to commit a sacrilege out anything, I love Doc's enthusiasm, but his voice sounds like someone built bagpipes with a live goose.
869353773793132544 2017-05-29 00:44:26 UTC <kinglolux> This is exactly why that rule sucks and linesman just need to be better.

869353352554885120 2017-05-29 00:42:45 UTC <kinglolux> #StanleyCup Hockey is so thrilling! The offside review calls! The stupid comments from Pierre! Milbury's subtle racism! @NHLonNBCSports

869303710517608448 2017-05-29 21:25:30 UTC <kinglolux> Don't apologize for your "mistake," apologize for your racism.
869303571921027072 2017-05-29 21:24:57 UTC <kinglolux> #Frei apology: giant paragraph glorifying his father's military history, defense of his political views, half-assed apology for "mistake."
869302340972498944 2017-05-29 21:20:03 UTC <kinglolux> Nothing personal, but it makes me uncomfortable when white people can't distinguish between Japanese people and WW2 enemy soldiers. #frei

867579672640356353 2017-05-24 03:14:47 UTC <kinglolux> Hannity reports story that is later disproved and retracted from his won network. Calls for him to resign are a "Liberal Smear Job!!!"

867574975313584128 2017-05-24 02:56:07 UTC <kinglolux> @Calilint @ColBannister Why have you chosen to trust one witness over another?
867573708788912128 2017-05-24 02:51:05 UTC <kinglolux> @birbigs Check it out: even the Foxy News team is saying it happened.http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/24/greg-gianforte-fox-news-team-witnesses-gop-house-candidate-body-slam-reporter.html
867572789397475329 2017-05-24 02:47:26 UTC <kinglolux> @Calilint @ColBannister Okay, and what about the statement from FOX News reporters corroborating Jacobs' account?
867571123554209792 2017-05-24 02:40:49 UTC <kinglolux> @Calilint @ColBannister How do you know he's lying? Why does it matter he's liberal?

867567962407944192 2017-05-24 02:28:15 UTC <kinglolux> Yeah, this is completely refuted by the audio recording that proves no one asked Jacobs to leave.https://twitter.com/ColBannister/status/867567435582500864
867543303096377344 2017-05-24 00:50:16 UTC <kinglolux> Holy shit. If that was a "badgering question" then what the hell is a normal one? Whispering?https://twitter.com/BraddJaffy/status/867534821337309184
867542793996034048 2017-05-24 00:48:14 UTC <kinglolux> I actually believe the etymology of "Gianforte" is a word describing a Greco-Roman wrestling move.

867068446881624064 2017-05-23 17:23:21 UTC <kinglolux> Twitter is great because it gives everyone a voice on the same platform. Unfortunately is a place for ignorant people to scream ignorantly.

865048730340171776 2017-05-17 03:37:43 UTC <kinglolux> Somehow LaVar Ball became an icon for the Men's Rights Activist movement today.
865003202189508608 2017-05-17 00:36:49 UTC <kinglolux> Wow. Does Pittsburgh know this game counts?

864980165381603329 2017-05-17 23:05:16 UTC <kinglolux> Make no mistake, Kershaw is the best, but if the Dodgers had today's offense yesterday they would have won too. Offense needs consistency.
864969342017982464 2017-05-17 22:22:16 UTC <kinglolux> @emmaduh If his name is Corey Perry it doesn't count.
864968257316438016 2017-05-17 22:17:57 UTC <kinglolux> @emmaduh And Orange county is almost as populous as LA is. They just don't care.
864966490935537664 2017-05-17 22:10:56 UTC <kinglolux> @emmaduh I love to harp on their attendance :P. The thing that is inexcusable to me is they're consistently good and their fans still don't care.
864965595808149505 2017-05-17 22:07:22 UTC <kinglolux> @emmaduh Since Ducks 07 Cup they've on avg been 22nd in the league in attendance, despite consistently good teams. Kings avg 15th, even w/shit teams.

864956966531088384 2017-05-17 21:33:05 UTC <kinglolux> @xTheUpsmanx Glad. 25 goals isn't worth that much money, though it's probably market value now. But any improvement for him at this point good. Ugh.
864955159746494464 2017-05-17 21:25:54 UTC <kinglolux> What if Dustin Brown returned to 25-goal-Dustin-Brown under Stevens? SHUT UP AND LET ME DREAM FOR FIVE MINUTES.
864953931977203712 2017-05-17 21:21:02 UTC <kinglolux> 2 runs is good, but if Puig homered there, Giants fans would jump into the Bay. Not for the ball but out of extreme disgust.

864933716971237376 2017-05-17 20:00:42 UTC <kinglolux> And all of this bravado comes before his son has ever set foot on a NBA court.
864933113960439808 2017-05-17 19:58:18 UTC <kinglolux> 9) He's essentially using his sons as a gravy train, but he does it through the backdoor by making it about his "brand."
864932739039899648 2017-05-17 19:56:49 UTC <kinglolux> 8) He insults a pundit for their rational criticizes of him by insinuating he's fat.
864932607267557376 2017-05-17 19:56:17 UTC <kinglolux> 7) He insults a reporter and refuses to answer her honest question about his shoe sales.
864932467710373888 2017-05-17 19:55:44 UTC <kinglolux> 6) He takes credit for his son's success and hard work.
864932366615166976 2017-05-17 19:55:20 UTC <kinglolux> 5) He puts undue pressure on his son by suggesting he'll be GOAT.
864932269852577792 2017-05-17 19:54:57 UTC <kinglolux> 4) He hurts his son's chances by putting his own baggage on his son's back.
864932140990947328 2017-05-17 19:54:26 UTC <kinglolux> 3) When he doesn't get the deal, he produces the shoes himself and charges $500 a pop, twice what elite NBA players charge.
864931990163804160 2017-05-17 19:53:50 UTC <kinglolux> 2) He asks for a $3 Billion dollar shoe deal for his son.
864931905593987072 2017-05-17 19:53:30 UTC <kinglolux> Let's break down why people hate on LaVar Ball. 1) He disrespects the best player of all time, saying he could have beat him 1-on-1.
864931280550379520 2017-05-17 19:51:01 UTC <kinglolux> People defending LaVar Ball are hilarious. Look up Strawman argument and get back to twitter with a rational perspective.
864930128211492864 2017-05-17 19:46:26 UTC <kinglolux> I'm so torn. I don't want to feed into his ego-trip but I really want to follow Lavar Ball because HE'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS.

862527085780148224 2017-05-10 04:37:36 UTC <kinglolux> Like, it can't be a coincidence that Randy Carlyle is the Ducks coach AND he happens to look like Baby Huey.

862522448570310656 2017-05-10 04:19:11 UTC <kinglolux> At this rate the Oilers are gonna need Anaheim to make a mistake.

748926261133602816 2016-07-01 17:08:29 UTC <kinglolux> If the #LAKings signed Lucic for the $ he got in Edmonton, they'd have $32,000 in cap space. Stop bitching about it.

748923083776331777 2016-07-01 16:55:52 UTC <kinglolux> Paid $1.4 for Gilbert. Still have cap-space, which is super valuable in this current world of overpaid players and crazy contracts. #LAKings
748922610163912704 2016-07-01 16:53:59 UTC <kinglolux> Okay, how much will Luke Schenn get overpaid for?
748922123876380674 2016-07-01 16:52:03 UTC <kinglolux> Looks like Gilbert is a stop gap until a homegrown Defenseman can take the spot. Hurry up, Forbort,Gravel.

748918506385580032 2016-07-01 16:37:40 UTC <kinglolux> Gilbert, pros: right shot, decent passer. Cons: corsi south of 50%

748259709719699456 2016-06-29 20:59:51 UTC <kinglolux> More I think about it, worse Subban/Weber seems. At least Chiarelli can say "We need D" or whatev. But Bergevin swapped Great D for Good D.
748258491807080448 2016-06-29 20:55:01 UTC <kinglolux> I gotta pee. Don't do anything while I'm gone, @NHL.

748254071610433537 2016-06-29 20:37:27 UTC <kinglolux> Weren't we all just saying yesterday that PK Subban trade rumors had to be bullshit because no one would do that?
748251535902048256 2016-06-29 20:27:22 UTC <kinglolux> Taylor Hall and PK Subban are trending right behind Crystal Pepsi. Today is weird. Happy #heterosexualprideday!

748247235159199744 2016-06-29 20:10:17 UTC <kinglolux> The thing is, Subban hasn't even reach potential. Imagine him with the defensive structure of Nashville.

748246180170129408 2016-06-29 20:06:05 UTC <kinglolux> What if... The Oilers made room for Lucic by trading Hall, but the Hall trade then makes Lucic not want to sign there?!?! #catch22

748244952526655488 2016-06-29 20:01:13 UTC <kinglolux> Is this why the value of the Canadian dollar is so low?
748244624779542529 2016-06-29 19:59:54 UTC <kinglolux> Ok, did MTL just trade for Weber for real? I don't know what's real anymore!!!
748243858899668993 2016-06-29 19:56:52 UTC <kinglolux> I don't trust the internet anymore today.
748243392417533954 2016-06-29 19:55:01 UTC <kinglolux> @decoy171 @britlovesmusic And if Lucic costs as much as we think he will, probably as much as Hall, it's even uglier.
748242585823522816 2016-06-29 19:51:48 UTC <kinglolux> @britlovesmusic @decoy171 If they don't sign Lucic after this it goes from bad to catastrophic.

745723090412265472 2016-06-22 21:00:14 UTC <kinglolux> @DieHardKingFans Just wouldn't work to sign Lucic for $6 mil. Cuz maths.
745722291128926209 2016-06-22 20:57:03 UTC <kinglolux> That's $17.075 mil to re-sign Toffoli and Pearson, a backup goaltender, a 6th defenseman AND 3 more fwds, and 3 more bench players. (pt 4)
745721481632452608 2016-06-22 20:53:50 UTC <kinglolux> @Kings_Den @LAJoey86 Well that just opens a whole slew of things for us, now doesn't it?pic.twitter.com/JDn4YlYtz5
745721148646690816 2016-06-22 20:52:31 UTC <kinglolux> With a max raise in cap to $76.65 mil, that would give the #LAKings $17.075 mil to pay 10 players. (pt 3)
745720536911618048 2016-06-22 20:50:05 UTC <kinglolux> That's $59.572 mil for 13 players, 7 forwards, 5 D, 1 goaltender. Need 10 more for a 23 man roster. (pt 2)
745720165812232196 2016-06-22 20:48:36 UTC <kinglolux> OK, let's say we gave Lucic his asking price of $6 mil x 6 yrs. Next season that would put the #LAKings at $59.572 mil total cap. (pt 1)
745719630426079232 2016-06-22 20:46:29 UTC <kinglolux> @hockeysaga And they have an "Outlaws" too. I can see the trend continuing.

738769346030276608 2016-06-03 16:28:32 UTC <kinglolux> @C3PHoe Milo Yiannopoulos is a self-centered ass, so I don't really take much stock in what he says.
738592527809314816 2016-06-02 04:45:55 UTC <kinglolux> @C3PHoe Certainly a good way to be.
738580419784806400 2016-06-02 03:57:48 UTC <kinglolux> Apparently even 12 runs is not enough for the Padres to stay ahead.
738579952329621509 2016-06-02 03:55:57 UTC <kinglolux> @snorinef Yes. Totes. Love J Willy forevs. But change dat name doe.
738578927476576256 2016-06-02 03:51:53 UTC <kinglolux> @snorinef Don't be that person that roots for Martin Jones even though he's now the enemy.

738540108840718338 2016-06-02 01:17:38 UTC <kinglolux> @ToniMacAttack Serious question: Why was BoB popular and The Pacific not? I haven't seen either but ppl laud BoB constantly.

738519568511959040 2016-06-02 23:56:00 UTC <kinglolux> @dagmar27 Ambivalent is a good word for it.
738518722604720128 2016-06-02 23:52:39 UTC <kinglolux> Also, I do appreciate that the Panthers' new logo doesn't look like it's choking on a chicken bone like the Coyotes.
738517355727183872 2016-06-02 23:47:13 UTC <kinglolux> A lot of NHL teams have logos that incorporate shields or seals. Interesting trend.
738516913735618561 2016-06-02 23:45:27 UTC <kinglolux> @nhl_haiku How about all of them sitting down to a buffet of sticks and pucks?!~?!
738516454136381440 2016-06-02 23:43:38 UTC <kinglolux> I'm nostalgic for the old Panthers logo but I don't hate the new one. At least it's not eating a stick.

738443679069655040 2016-06-02 18:54:27 UTC <kinglolux> Not worried about Julio's future. He'll get his time. Trial by fire. #Dodgers
738442654564810752 2016-06-02 18:50:23 UTC <kinglolux> Rizzo, who should have struck out, scores their first run. Awesome. #Dodgers
738442147397935104 2016-06-02 18:48:22 UTC <kinglolux> Jesus, Urias earned that strikeout and then some.
738441071684767744 2016-06-02 18:44:05 UTC <kinglolux> Urias just strike out Rizzo twice in one AB but Rizzo gets the walk. #Dodgers
