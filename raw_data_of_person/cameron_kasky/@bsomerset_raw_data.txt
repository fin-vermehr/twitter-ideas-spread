713113704942862336 2016-03-24 21:22:10 UTC <bsomerset> @united, the mechanical delays are starting to get old.  Ur becoming @AmericanAir.  Getting rid of the #CRJ200 will help. #protip
713073907675181056 2016-03-24 18:44:02 UTC <bsomerset> @realDonaldTrump You alone can do nothing.  If you think that's what the presidency is, you alone, then you're sorely mistaken #NeverTrump
712778259474288640 2016-03-23 23:09:14 UTC <bsomerset> @realDonaldTrump Losers whine about "unfair".  That's one thing you seem to be really good at.
712611328062566400 2016-03-23 12:05:54 UTC <bsomerset> @jemelehill that shirt...#amazing #harriettubman
709922297814114307 2016-03-15 02:00:40 UTC <bsomerset> @realDonaldTrump, I just can't...it's nearly impossible to listen to your incessant 4th grade level rambling.  What an #asshat.
709912296215019520 2016-03-15 01:20:55 UTC <bsomerset> Is every @realDonaldTrump clap a golf clap?  #smallhands #smallermind
709148641793957889 2016-03-13 22:46:26 UTC <bsomerset> The #NCAATOURNAMENT selection committee is trolling @notthefakeSVP with that @SDState matchup against his #Terps.
707979103488577536 2016-03-10 17:19:06 UTC <bsomerset> @united @United it's time to work with your regional partners to scrap the #CRJ200.  It has outlived its usefulness and is so uncomfortable.
705607137674723328 2016-03-03 04:13:45 UTC <bsomerset> From what I'm seeing, @realDonaldTrump got his not #tinyhands synonymous junk handed 2 him 2nite by @JohnKasich and @tedcruz. #GOPDebate
700794142192832516 2016-02-19 21:28:38 UTC <bsomerset> @Apple I bet @realDonaldTrump can't wait for @apple to release the #iphone5se.  Now he'll be able to reach the entire screen with those #tinyhands
695050584227852288 2016-02-03 01:05:47 UTC <bsomerset> @realDonaldTrump losers cry about cheaters...winners win.  #secondisthefirstloser #howistheviewbackthere
693790007316733952 2016-01-31 13:36:42 UTC <bsomerset> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends so the question is then what DID you give to @JerryJrFalwell for his "endorsement"?  #phonyliberty
692932497911472128 2016-01-28 04:49:16 UTC <bsomerset> Thankful @FoxNews didn't have to show a montage of all of @realDonaldTrump's untruths; longer than a Godfather saga marathon. #GOPDEBATE
692917516658724864 2016-01-28 03:49:44 UTC <bsomerset> #GOPDebate @tedcruz: Princeton, Harvard, SCOTUS clerkship, Bush policy advisor, deputy AG @ Justice Dept, policy director @ FTC, US senator
692917251905843200 2016-01-28 03:48:41 UTC <bsomerset> If you took @tedcruz name off of his resume, it's the encyclopedic epitome of the career politician; Washington insider. #GOPDebate
692912852760403975 2016-01-28 03:31:12 UTC <bsomerset> If it wasn't for the common sense containing it on each end of the stage, the audience would be consumed in a BS tidal wave. #GOPDebate
692816685741506560 2016-01-28 21:09:04 UTC <bsomerset> @fly2ohare I love it when the gate area for my departing flight seconds as the employee break room.
692201716293472256 2016-01-26 04:25:24 UTC <bsomerset> @realDonaldTrump Was this the winner of an elementary school writing competition?  #childish #incompetent #foolish #selfish
690766408288894976 2016-01-22 05:22:00 UTC <bsomerset> @realDonaldTrump Pretty high up on the list for a drug addict, no?  Between him and @SarahPalinUSA, you've got the nut bag market locked up.
690288007493107712 2016-01-21 21:41:00 UTC <bsomerset> Dearest @united, the #CRJ200 is the worst plane invented.  Can we phase out this antiquated dinosaur already?  #lavhastheonlygoodseat
