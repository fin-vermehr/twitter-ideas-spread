922241904489537536 2017-10-22 23:22:59 UTC <jonogden_> @thisisBrianJ How does that square with the fact that so many secular-leaning countries (Finland, Denmark, Germany, etc) have high social capital?

849671832261214208 2017-04-05 17:15:25 UTC <jonogden_> @jbarro Speaking against bad headlines won't make everything better, but it got the NYT to make that bad headline better.

844267735131443200 2017-03-21 19:21:28 UTC <jonogden_> @CurtisUT An example of the right way to apologize and simultaneously move forward. Thank you!
842426075573506048 2017-03-16 17:23:22 UTC <jonogden_> @mattyglesias In the vein of #5, I'd like to see more thorough explanations of why you're snarky about certain topics on Twitter.
841448977472020480 2017-03-13 00:40:44 UTC <jonogden_> @allinwithchris @chrislhayes @MSNBC This is an important series. Builds empathy. Keep it up.
838879968398458881 2017-03-06 22:32:24 UTC <jonogden_> @rachelsteenblik That is beautiful. Thanks for sharing  I contributed as a result. I also loved this from Emily.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g1uOabBNf4

836640917012414464 2017-02-28 18:15:13 UTC <jonogden_> @ByCommonConsent @hankrsmith Trump isn't vile for saying naughty words. He's vile for misogyny and sexual abuse. Enormous difference.
836383645422137344 2017-02-27 01:12:54 UTC <jonogden_> @Chris_arnade Matt Taibbi did a take like that http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/revenge-of-the-simple-how-george-w-bush-gave-rise-to-trump-20160301 (I'd still like to see yours too!)
834542562987761664 2017-02-22 23:17:06 UTC <jonogden_> @CNNPolitics @KFILE I attended his town hall as one of his constituents and wrote this letter https://extranewsfeed.com/an-open-letter-to-jason-chaffetz-from-someone-who-attended-his-town-hall-41d3ff348c9f#.w1mlmf9zh Happy to discuss.
831636243133853696 2017-02-14 22:48:26 UTC <jonogden_> @shl Yes, I'm interested. I'm a big fan of Gumroad!

830204318405890049 2017-02-10 23:58:28 UTC <jonogden_> @jasoninthehouse Thanks for the town hall! I was there and wanted you to know my group drove up from Provo (not out of state) to boo you.
830196160191033344 2017-02-10 23:26:03 UTC <jonogden_> @mckaycoppins @BenjaminEPark I was there (inside) last night, and this is the most accurate piece I've read about the event. Great work.
828714830575964160 2017-02-06 21:19:47 UTC <jonogden_> @matt_higginson This would make a great series. So many reminders to choose from!
826901288386334720 2017-02-01 21:13:24 UTC <jonogden_> @CJaneKendrick Gina is amazing! Such a fabulous interviewer.
826900429258715136 2017-02-01 21:10:00 UTC <jonogden_> @CJaneKendrick It is painful. I have to take breaks from stepping in some shoes (sometimes for weeks or months) until I feel I can try again
826898039423905792 2017-02-01 21:00:30 UTC <jonogden_> @CJaneKendrick To the extent that it helps you learn how to better move them toward empathy, yes. (maybe?) Tough question.
826871115192496133 2017-02-01 19:13:31 UTC <jonogden_> @editoremilye I've noticed something similar this winter. Definitely worries me.https://twitter.com/TheDaveCrow/status/826831356319584256
825459284267786241 2017-01-28 21:43:24 UTC <jonogden_> @windley They likely believe that the best technology in the world is meaningless if we lose our humanity.

824337497710669825 2017-01-25 19:25:49 UTC <jonogden_> @ggreenwald @Stolenmeat All of them approved? I'd love to see a source if you have one handy.
824042593616961536 2017-01-24 23:53:58 UTC <jonogden_> @ggreenwald @plaidbydefault I definitely have a strong hunch it's true. Would like to find the numbers to confirm.
824037155739533313 2017-01-24 23:32:22 UTC <jonogden_> @ggreenwald Did Republicans cater this much to Obama's nominees, or are Democrats particularly conciliatory?
822949932269043712 2017-01-21 23:32:08 UTC <jonogden_> @cnni Good headline
822928735275888640 2017-01-21 22:07:54 UTC <jonogden_> @Evan_McMullin Did he plant supporters in the audience, or was the CIA really cheering?
822582158283931654 2017-01-20 23:10:44 UTC <jonogden_> @matt_higginson As one of his constituents, my #1 political goal over the next two years is to help unseat him.
821046630975553537 2017-01-16 17:29:05 UTC <jonogden_> @editoremilye This has troubled me for years. In the heart of Mormonism the homeless turn to the Catholics.

819967471293583361 2017-01-13 18:00:54 UTC <jonogden_> @AustenAllred Degrees of untrustworthiness matter. Lying every fiftieth sentence is not the same as lying every other sentence.
817018455698178050 2017-01-05 14:42:33 UTC <jonogden_> @mattyglesias Do you have an article where you compile these examples? The case is powerful in the collective.
816336816768884736 2017-01-03 17:33:58 UTC <jonogden_> @dylanmatt I hadn't heard of Parfit until this week, and I just wanted to say that I really appreciated this write-up. Thank you.
811215052950769664 2016-12-20 14:21:54 UTC <jonogden_> @leimer Sorry to hear this, Brad. My condolences.

808321746390482948 2016-12-12 14:44:56 UTC <jonogden_> @AustenAllred What do you think of a news model where each article points to a book written by one of the collective authors? /1
804730490510901248 2016-12-02 16:54:34 UTC <jonogden_> @anthgarrett Ah, I thought it was a typo. :)
804728181685002240 2016-12-02 16:45:24 UTC <jonogden_> @anthgarrett To clarify: You are not a Hamilton fan and you have listened to all of it, including part two?
804707351794069504 2016-12-02 15:22:38 UTC <jonogden_> @RideUTA The path to the Frontrunner station in Provo is consistently blocked by a stalled coal train.
799748274810798080 2016-11-18 22:57:01 UTC <jonogden_> @Peggynoonannyc 60M people are not "very happy, and hopeful." 29% of Trump voters don't even think he's honest. http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/huge-margin-working-class-whites-lifts-trump-stunning/story?id=43411948pic.twitter.com/dVddK9gPYt
799377441969967104 2016-11-17 22:23:28 UTC <jonogden_> @CurtisUT @editoremilye I'm hoping @Curtisut steps up. I'd campaign like crazy for him.
799376700513521664 2016-11-17 22:20:31 UTC <jonogden_> @editoremilye I'd love to help flip Chaffetz. Is there a chance? What should I do to lay the foundation for that today? Keep calling? :)
799372899832340481 2016-11-17 22:05:25 UTC <jonogden_> @editoremilye What's the best anti-Trump move for us to make in Utah  possibly in the 2018 election?
799361069424619520 2016-11-17 21:18:25 UTC <jonogden_> @NaomiShulman I love this quote. Just to clarify, was your mom in WWII Germany?
798974142095638528 2016-11-16 19:40:54 UTC <jonogden_> @RyanHoliday I love this piece, but I wouldn't have found it without following you on Twitter. What should I do?
798966776172163072 2016-11-16 19:11:38 UTC <jonogden_> @editoremilye I'm in Utah Valley and want to commit to one thing that can make a difference in the 2018 elections. What do you recommend?
798941463224545280 2016-11-16 17:31:03 UTC <jonogden_> @MichaelWorley3 Yes. ogden.jon [at] gmail [dot] com
797761975120003072 2016-11-13 11:24:11 UTC <jonogden_> @mattyglesias @kairyssdal And to stop the false narrative that 50% of the nation supports Trump. (It's closer to 20%.)
797740906430533632 2016-11-13 10:00:28 UTC <jonogden_> @monteiro Does history bear out that this is a successful strategy?
797054657029881856 2016-11-11 12:33:33 UTC <jonogden_> @JenSeniorNY Last night I sent your review of Kelly's book to my dad, who fears liberal media bias. Now he is more convinced of it. :(pic.twitter.com/1MCIkZYb4U

796392151638822913 2016-11-09 16:40:59 UTC <jonogden_> @swiftj I would assume so, yes. It makes me lose so much respect for Mormons.
796388129716387840 2016-11-09 16:25:00 UTC <jonogden_> @swiftj A higher % than protestants. Egads.

765293084284366848 2016-08-15 21:04:24 UTC <jonogden_> @anthgarrett So you're still bold.

765292211311300608 2016-08-15 21:00:56 UTC <jonogden_> @anthgarrett Bold because most critics and viewers would put Tree of Life, Thin Red Line, and Days of Heaven above The New World.

753290652524220416 2016-07-13 18:11:01 UTC <jonogden_> @UpdatedPriors That way research could be accurate and framed in a way that's compelling to the public.
