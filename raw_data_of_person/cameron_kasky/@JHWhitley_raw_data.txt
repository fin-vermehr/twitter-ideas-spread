972384560771026945 2018-03-10 08:11:59 UTC <JHWhitley> Some people have already decided to vote Democrat next election, regardless of who it is. This is the lesser of two evils mentality at work.

972294189600796674 2018-03-09 02:12:53 UTC <JHWhitley> If your house is on fire, you don't invite people to come live with you. Immigration reform is important, but let's see if we can get our own people off the streets first. Do that, immigration is easy. #ImmigrationReform
972293110658228224 2018-03-09 02:08:36 UTC <JHWhitley> @KayKosmos I got the fix for this, http://jameswhitley.com > Healthcare
972292869946945536 2018-03-09 02:07:39 UTC <JHWhitley> Exercise: Assume the next President, and America, is behind the single payer system for healthcare.

972292864024633344 2018-03-09 02:07:37 UTC <JHWhitley> Pay a social worker $50,000/year to go find homeless people, interview them, work on job placement and housing. If 1 person a day gets into an entry-level job and averages $1500/yr in taxes, that would be $547,500/yr paid into the system. We make 10x return on our investment.

972170005755265024 2018-03-09 17:59:26 UTC <JHWhitley> A divided nation is easy for congress to ignore. When elected official in a two party race get elected by only a 1% difference, that official has the mentality that no matter what they do, half the people are for it, half are against.

972169873596981248 2018-03-09 17:58:54 UTC <JHWhitley> Seeing the stock market rise does not impress me. Seeing the homeless population decrease would.
972169869696339969 2018-03-09 17:58:53 UTC <JHWhitley> Education should not be about memorizing answers for a test. It should teach critical thinking, self-worth, and life skills.  You know, things needed for life after school. See more at https://jameswhitley.com/?Topic=7
972169282657243136 2018-03-09 17:56:33 UTC <JHWhitley> Current healthcare is a scam! 29% of my income goes to insurance that they don't want to give back.

972166504828493824 2018-03-09 17:45:31 UTC <JHWhitley> America has a "lesser of two evils" mentality when voting, even when there's a third option. If people voted for what they believed in, instead of against who they hate the most, we'd be better off.  Vote independent to break the Washington stalemate so we can move forward.

972165819206582272 2018-03-09 17:42:47 UTC <JHWhitley> Legalize marijuana nationwide and tax it. 100% of that tax revenue pays for education and healthcare. What do you think of that as a solution? #LegalizeMarijuana
972165727468711936 2018-03-09 17:42:26 UTC <JHWhitley> Suppose Trump decided that some online news is fake news. And he wanted to have that internet traffic "regulated" so you don't see it. Do you trust him to make that choice for you? This is why we need net neutrality, to protect our first amendment online. #NetNeutrality

972165724469829632 2018-03-09 17:42:25 UTC <JHWhitley> A friend asked, why hydrogen over electric? The answer is electric cars takes at least an hour to charge. Hydrogen cars fuel up in less than 3 minutes. And most people are only environmentally responsible if its convenient.

972165720594198528 2018-03-09 17:42:24 UTC <JHWhitley> Trump's #HarvestBox is a bad idea. To control cost, it will be the cheapest "food" possible. Bad nutrition is part of our healthcare crisis. More people on medication to counter the effect of bad nutrition, more money for big pharma. https://jameswhitley.com/
972161786668400640 2018-03-09 17:26:46 UTC <JHWhitley> In 2016, so many people were upset with the primary candidates they began looking at third party candidates. This happens almost every election.

972158048729939968 2018-03-09 17:11:55 UTC <JHWhitley> Getting people to follow what they've always known is easy. Educating them to the point they can choose a new path, that's hard.

972141961560731648 2018-03-09 16:07:59 UTC <JHWhitley> Instead of arbitrarily raising minimum wage, let's raise the standard of education so that no high school graduate has to accept minimum wage. #LivingWage
972139816820252672 2018-03-09 15:59:28 UTC <JHWhitley> Is a vote for a third party a wasted vote? You tell me. Is your opinion a waste? #ThirdParty #Independent
972139797580926976 2018-03-09 15:59:23 UTC <JHWhitley> Next election, don't vote for the lesser of two evils. That's how we got here. As many people who thought Hillary was the lesser, just as many thought the same of Trump. Thus, those who submit to the "lesser of two evils" mentality drown out those voting for what they believe.

972137460040790016 2018-03-09 15:50:06 UTC <JHWhitley> When money flows from the poor to the rich, it's called capitalism. When money flows from the rich to the poor, it's called socialism. Which side of the &ldquo;flow&rdquo; are you on? https://jameswhitley.com/
972135274955268097 2018-03-09 15:41:25 UTC <JHWhitley> Electing leaders that piss on the %99 is a reflection of education. When you don't know anything, it's easy to lie to you. So download my video and show it to a dumbass you know. They wouldn't even know there's always more options if they just rely on the media to educate them.

971076387455909888 2018-03-06 17:33:47 UTC <JHWhitley> A friend asked, why hydrogen over electric? The answer is electric cars takes at least an hour to charge. Hydrogen cars fuel up in less than 3 minutes. And most people are only environmentally responsible if its convenient.
971065701711544320 2018-03-06 16:51:19 UTC <JHWhitley> The future is coming. Several countries are building their own hydrogen economy. America must decide if we are going to drive the future, or play catch up. https://jameswhitley.com/
971063510523195392 2018-03-06 16:42:37 UTC <JHWhitley> When money flows from the poor to the rich, it's called capitalism. When money flows from the rich to the poor, it's called socialism. Which side of the &ldquo;flow&rdquo; are you on? https://jameswhitley.com/

971063053876776960 2018-03-06 16:40:48 UTC <JHWhitley> As a web developer, I believe coding should be taught in schools. It teaches critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving.  Something the memorize this crap youll never use in real life mentality of our current education system lacks.
971063051024662528 2018-03-06 16:40:47 UTC <JHWhitley> If your house is on fire, you don't invite people to come live with you. Immigration reform is important, but let's see if we can get our own people off the streets first. Do that, immigration is easy. #ImmigrationReform
971063050546507777 2018-03-06 16:40:47 UTC <JHWhitley> Weakness is often a state of mind. If you believe you can't, you won't. https://jameswhitley.com/

971063050336792577 2018-03-06 16:40:47 UTC <JHWhitley> Is a vote for a third party a wasted vote? You tell me. Is your opinion a waste? #ThirdParty #Independent
971063050265534465 2018-03-06 16:40:47 UTC <JHWhitley> Seeing the stock market rise does not impress me. Seeing the homeless population decrease would.
971063047132405761 2018-03-06 16:40:46 UTC <JHWhitley> Trump's #HarvestBox is a bad idea. To control cost, it will be the cheapest "food" possible. Bad nutrition is part of our healthcare crisis. More people on medication to counter the effect of bad nutrition, more money for big pharma. https://jameswhitley.com/
971062975619522560 2018-03-06 16:40:29 UTC <JHWhitley> Next election, don't vote for the lesser of two evils. That's how we got here. As many people who thought Hillary was the lesser, just as many thought the same of Trump. Thus, those who submit to the "lesser of two evils" mentality drown out those voting for what they believe.
971062929268211712 2018-03-06 16:40:18 UTC <JHWhitley> Electing leaders that piss on the %99 is a reflection of education. When you don't know anything, it's easy to lie to you. So download my video and show it to a dumbass you know. They wouldn't even know there's always more options if they just rely on the media to educate them.
971062888331804673 2018-03-06 16:40:08 UTC <JHWhitley> Are you a dreamer? Do you dream of a government that represents the common person? So do I. Dreams are just the beginning. If you want see your dreams come true, you must take action. Because few people will place your dreams above theirs.
971062871286140929 2018-03-06 16:40:04 UTC <JHWhitley> Children need to feel like part of a family and a community, not like a interchangeable gear in a machine. Help me to restore this principle to our education system. http://jameswhitley.com > Education

971051073321529344 2018-03-06 15:53:11 UTC <JHWhitley> I find it ironic that so many people want change but so few are willing to do something different.
970923384023302144 2018-03-05 07:25:48 UTC <JHWhitley> Suppose Trump decided that some online news is fake news. And he wanted to have that internet traffic "regulated" so you don't see it. Do you trust him to make that choice for you? This is why we need net neutrality, to protect our first amendment online. #NetNeutrality
970884754362036224 2018-03-05 04:52:18 UTC <JHWhitley> @kirasmoon That's why I need to win by more than 1%. The more people behind me, the harder to ignore. This may all seem impossible, but sitting around hoping that someone makes a positive change on our behalf isn't working so well.
970878934698070018 2018-03-05 04:29:10 UTC <JHWhitley> @kirasmoon I'm here to represent people who have had it with the current system. And if we are determined to make a change, nothing is out of our capabilities.
970878139709698048 2018-03-05 04:26:01 UTC <JHWhitley> @kirasmoon If you elect someone like that, don't be surprised when you get the same old song and dance..
970877278061256704 2018-03-05 04:22:35 UTC <JHWhitley> @kirasmoon I don't want to be just another politician who learns how to do things the way they have always been done...
970876646021566464 2018-03-05 04:20:05 UTC <JHWhitley> @kirasmoon If he was not one of them, they wouldn't have bankrolled his campaign... He's still acting like an idiot so we don't see the malicious intent...
970875551115366400 2018-03-05 04:15:44 UTC <JHWhitley> @kirasmoon Trump's greatest trick was convincing everyone he was not a politician, even though he been working with them since the 80s...
970869995713343489 2018-03-05 03:53:39 UTC <JHWhitley> If the 99% wants to be represented in #Washington, they should elect someone capable of representing them. Someone who lives as they do, pays the same taxes they do, and has the same health care options they do. Like mehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVhvAPa08SU
970868354041856000 2018-03-05 03:47:08 UTC <JHWhitley> Sitting around hoping for change is not going to bring about change. Tell everyone you know of me, and if they like what I'm about, have them follow me!  If they don't have a twitter, tell them to get one! You are now the army of hope! https://jameswhitley.com/
970868288879190016 2018-03-05 03:46:52 UTC <JHWhitley> Instead of arbitrarily raising minimum wage, let's raise the standard of education so that no high school graduate has to accept minimum wage. #LivingWage
970868285645336578 2018-03-05 03:46:51 UTC <JHWhitley> I need a million followers for the media to take me serious. Ten million followers for Washington to take notice. And fifty million to piss Trump off. Follow me, RT & visit https://www.jameswhitley.com/
970868280154976256 2018-03-05 03:46:50 UTC <JHWhitley> A nation of citizens living in fear is easy for a tyrant to control. Step one, create more fear... What are you afraid of? And how can that be used against you?
970868093776900097 2018-03-05 03:46:06 UTC <JHWhitley> Education should not be about memorizing answers for a test. It should teach critical thinking, self-worth, and life skills.  You know, things needed for life after school. See more at https://jameswhitley.com/?Topic=7

You? https://jameswhitley.com/
970867702670635008 2018-03-05 03:44:32 UTC <JHWhitley> We have a severe mental health problem in America. No one whose life is going great, good, or even halfway decent, wakes up one day and decides to go kill a bunch of random people. We need to address the why more so than the how if we ever want to stop it from happening.
970865407975395328 2018-03-05 03:35:25 UTC <JHWhitley> @EricVonFluger 2nd amendment supported... I'll get to the rest tomorrow...

970856190585401344 2018-03-05 02:58:48 UTC <JHWhitley> America has a "lesser of two evils" mentality when voting, even when there's a third option. If people voted for what they believed in, instead of against who they hate the most, we'd be better off.  Vote independent to break the Washington stalemate so we can move forward.

970846114034343936 2018-03-05 02:18:45 UTC <JHWhitley> Politicians always say "Small businesses are the backbone of our country!", but do nothing to held them.

970831030906056704 2018-03-05 01:18:49 UTC <JHWhitley> In 2016, so many people were upset with the primary candidates they began looking at third party candidates. This happens almost every election. So be in the know and research third party candidates before you're so upset with the top two you can't see. #Resistance #Shoutdown
970830953340813312 2018-03-05 01:18:31 UTC <JHWhitley> A divided nation is easy for congress to ignore. When elected official in a two party race get elected by only a 1% difference, that official has the mentality that no matter what they do, half the people are for it, half are against.
970830946395078656 2018-03-05 01:18:29 UTC <JHWhitley> Pay a social worker $50,000/year to go find homeless people, interview them, work on job placement and housing. If 1 person a day gets into an entry-level job and averages $1500/yr in taxes, that would be $547,500/yr paid into the system. We make 10x return on our investment.

970830943089930240 2018-03-05 01:18:28 UTC <JHWhitley> The reason we are losing ground in the global market is our education system sucks! We've created a whole generation that's largely unprepared for real life. To fix this, we're going to need to make some changes.

970824283571277824 2018-03-05 00:52:00 UTC <JHWhitley> @lf092313 Yes they should! If we automatically drafted 10% of congressional family members everytime we want to go to war, we'd see allot less of it. It's easy to send somebody else to do your fighting for you.
970823388699574272 2018-03-05 00:48:27 UTC <JHWhitley> For this country to be the best it can be, we need everyone involved.  To this end, women need to be educated, empowered, and in charge of their own destiny! Retweet if you agree and spread the message!

969474388700508161 2018-03-01 07:28:00 UTC <JHWhitley> Pay a social worker $50,000/year to go find homeless people, interview them, work on job placement and housing. If 1 person a day gets into an entry-level job and averages $1500/yr in taxes, that would be $547,500/yr paid into the system. We make 10x return on our investment.

969474192952315905 2018-03-01 07:27:14 UTC <JHWhitley> The reason we are losing ground in the global market is our education system sucks! We've created a whole generation that's largely unprepared for real life. To fix this, we're going to need to make some changes. Go to https://jameswhitley.com?Topic=7jameswhitley.com/?Topic=7 to see what I have in mind.

969474107363377152 2018-03-01 07:26:53 UTC <JHWhitley> As a web developer, I believe coding should be taught in schools. It teaches critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving.  Something the memorize this crap youll never use in real life mentality of our current education system lacks.
969474079601209344 2018-03-01 07:26:47 UTC <JHWhitley> A divided nation is easy for congress to ignore. When elected official in a two party race get elected by only a 1% difference, that official has the mentality that no matter what they do, half the people are for it, half are against.

969473946432098304 2018-03-01 07:26:15 UTC <JHWhitley> Next election, don't vote for the lesser of two evils. That's how we got here. As many people who thought Hillary was the lesser, just as many thought the same of Trump. Thus, those who submit to the "lesser of two evils" mentality drown out those voting for what they believe.
969473943500304385 2018-03-01 07:26:14 UTC <JHWhitley> Education should not be about memorizing answers for a test. It should teach critical thinking, self-worth, and life skills.  You know, things needed for life after school. See more at https://jameswhitley.com/?Topic=7

968726456980398080 2018-02-27 05:56:00 UTC <JHWhitley> Next election, don't vote for the lesser of two evils. That's how we got here. As many people who thought Hillary was the lesser, just as many thought the same of Trump. Thus, those who submit to the "lesser of two evils" mentality drown out those voting for what they believe.
968726456934289408 2018-02-27 05:56:00 UTC <JHWhitley> You've been told a third party can't win. By who, a two party system? Convenient. What happens if the 100 million registered voters who didn't vote in 2016 got motivated? Maybe I don't need to fip anyone... https://jameswhitley.com/

968726451968241665 2018-02-27 05:55:58 UTC <JHWhitley> Trump's #HarvestBox is a bad idea. To control cost, it will be the cheapest "food" possible. Bad nutrition is part of our healthcare crisis. More people on medication to counter the effect of bad nutrition, more money for big pharma. https://jameswhitley.com/
968726444628115456 2018-02-27 05:55:57 UTC <JHWhitley> When a wealthy man who has known money his entire life, hangs out with the rich and famous, buddies upto the corporate and Wall Street elite, says he's going to make america great again, who do you think he talking about making it great for? You? https://jameswhitley.com/
968726422557687813 2018-02-27 05:55:51 UTC <JHWhitley> We have a severe mental health problem in America. No one whose life is going great, good, or even halfway decent, wakes up one day and decides to go kill a bunch of random people. We need to address the why more so than the how if we ever want to stop it from happening.
968726378702102528 2018-02-27 05:55:41 UTC <JHWhitley> Are you a dreamer? Do you dream of a government that represents the common person? So do I. Dreams are just the beginning. If you want see your dreams come true, you must take action. Because few people will place your dreams above theirs.
968726328081076224 2018-02-27 05:55:29 UTC <JHWhitley> Electing leaders that piss on the %99 is a reflection of education. When you don't know anything, it's easy to lie to you. So download my video and show it to a dumbass you know. They wouldn't even know there's always more options if they just rely on the media to educate them.
968726315158462465 2018-02-27 05:55:26 UTC <JHWhitley> America has a "lesser of two evils" mentality when voting, even when there's a third option. If people voted for what they believed in, instead of against who they hate the most, we'd be better off.  Vote independent to break the Washington stalemate so we can move forward.
968726264310792194 2018-02-27 05:55:14 UTC <JHWhitley> Getting people to follow what they've always known is easy. Educating them to the point they can choose a new path, that's hard.

968549553984057345 2018-02-27 18:13:03 UTC <JHWhitley> Suppose Trump decided that some online news is fake news. And he wanted to have that internet traffic "regulated" so you don't see it.

968003396077682688 2018-02-25 06:02:48 UTC <JHWhitley> When a wealthy man who has known money his entire life, hangs out with the rich and famous, buddies upto the corporate and Wall Street elite, says he's going to make america great again, who do you think he talking about making it great for? You?

967996300305117184 2018-02-25 05:34:37 UTC <JHWhitley> We have a severe mental health problem in America. No one whose life is going great, good, or even halfway decent, wakes up one day and decides to go kill a bunch of random people. We need to address the why more so than the how if we ever want to stop it from happening.
967995732119584768 2018-02-25 05:32:21 UTC <JHWhitley> Getting people to follow what they've always known is easy. Educating them to the point they can choose a new path, that's hard.
967994110647791616 2018-02-25 05:25:55 UTC <JHWhitley> America has a "lesser of two evils" mentality when voting, even when there's a third option. If people voted for what they believed in, instead of against who they hate the most, we'd be better off.  Vote independent to break the Washington stalemate so we can move forward.
967980543475372032 2018-02-25 04:32:00 UTC <JHWhitley> @TheDailyShow Love me, hate me, or just want to make fun of me for attempting the impossible.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVhvAPa08SU
967976362416861184 2018-02-25 04:15:23 UTC <JHWhitley> The future is coming. Several countries are building their own hydrogen economy. America must decide if we are going to drive the future, or play catch up.
967976236197691393 2018-02-25 04:14:53 UTC <JHWhitley> Are you a dreamer? Do you dream of a government that represents the common person? So do I. Dreams are just the beginning. If you want see your dreams come true, you must take action. Because few people will place your dreams above theirs.
967976092316286977 2018-02-25 04:14:19 UTC <JHWhitley> I need a million followers for the media to take me serious. Ten million followers for Washington to take notice. And fifty million to piss Trump off. Follow me, RT & visit https://www.jameswhitley.com/
967976079657861120 2018-02-25 04:14:16 UTC <JHWhitley> If your house is on fire, you don't invite people to come live with you. Immigration reform is important, but let's see if we can get our own people off the streets first. Do that, immigration is easy. #ImmigrationReform
967976075304325120 2018-02-25 04:14:15 UTC <JHWhitley> @Lorisadventure I have some plans for education reform you might like. https://jameswhitley.com/ > Education
967975929988374530 2018-02-25 04:13:40 UTC <JHWhitley> Some corporations pay (lobby, the legal way to bribe) politicians to maintain the status quo. Some politicians are more interested in lining their pockets than helping the people who elected them to represent them. Can you spot them? Before they take office that is...
967975492807688192 2018-02-25 04:11:56 UTC <JHWhitley> @Lorisadventure I got a plan for that. Putting Telepresence in schools would allow students to stay home and learn. Except for test days. http://jameswhitley.com > Education
967974383661862912 2018-02-25 04:07:31 UTC <JHWhitley> @ericgarland Brief history lesson, Russia has always used North Korea as a pawn against us. Read up on the Korean War. Spacifly were "Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War

967970131757289472 2018-02-25 03:50:38 UTC <JHWhitley> As a web developer, I believe coding should be taught in schools. It teaches critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving.  Something the memorize this crap youll never use in real life mentality of our current education system lacks.
967966834237435906 2018-02-25 03:37:31 UTC <JHWhitley> When money flows from the poor to the rich, its called capitalism. When money flows from the rich to the poor, its called socialism. Which side of the flow are you on?
967966475288903680 2018-02-25 03:36:06 UTC <JHWhitley> Legalize marijuana nationwide and tax it. 100% of that tax revenue pays for education and healthcare. What do you think of that as a solution? #LegalizeMarijuana
967966465562361856 2018-02-25 03:36:03 UTC <JHWhitley> Pay a social worker $50,000/year to go find homeless people, interview them, work on job placement and housing. If 1 person a day gets into an entry-level job and averages $1500/yr in taxes, that would be $547,500/yr paid into the system. We make 10x return on our investment.

967820983070375942 2018-02-25 17:57:58 UTC <JHWhitley> A friend asked, why hydrogen over electric? The answer is electric cars takes at least an hour to charge. Hydrogen cars fuel up in less than 3 minutes. And most people are only environmentally responsible if its convenient.

967818865819267072 2018-02-25 17:49:33 UTC <JHWhitley> Electing leaders that piss on the %99 is a reflection of education. When you don't know anything, it's easy to lie to you. So download my video and show it to a dumbass you know. They wouldn't even know there's always more options if they just rely on the media to educate them.

967818759619538944 2018-02-25 17:49:08 UTC <JHWhitley> Trump's #HarvestBox is a bad idea. To control cost, it will be the cheapest "food" possible. Bad nutrition is part of our healthcare crisis. More people on medication to counter the effect of bad nutrition, more money for big pharma.
967818757857976320 2018-02-25 17:49:07 UTC <JHWhitley> For this country to be the best it can be, we need everyone involved.  To this end, women need to be educated, empowered, and in charge of their own destiny! Retweet if you agree and spread the message!

As many people who thought Hillary was the lesser, just as many thought the same of Trump. Thus, those who submit to the "lesser of two evils" mentality drown out those voting for what they believe.

966894312570085376 2018-02-22 04:35:42 UTC <JHWhitley> America has a "lesser of two evils" mentality when voting, even when there's a third option. If people voted for what they believed in, instead of against who they hate the most, we'd be better off.  Vote independent to break the Washington stalemate so we can move forward.
966892956861939717 2018-02-22 04:30:19 UTC <JHWhitley> A divided nation is easy for congress to ignore. When elected official in a two party race get elected by only a 1% difference, that official has the mentality that no matter what they do, half the people are for it, half are against.

966865440436666369 2018-02-22 02:40:59 UTC <JHWhitley> Electing leaders that piss on the %99 is a reflection of education. When you don't know anything, it's easy to lie to you. So download my video and show it to a dumbass you know. They wouldn't even know there's always more options if they just rely on the media to educate them.

965737779362545664 2018-02-19 00:00:03 UTC <JHWhitley> Trump's #HarvestBox is a bad idea. To control cost, it will be the cheapest "food" possible. Bad nutrition is part of our healthcare crisis. More people on medication to counter the effect of bad nutrition, more money for big pharma.
965710000621420544 2018-02-19 22:09:40 UTC <JHWhitley> @shiloe101 Pay a social worker $50,000/year to go find homeless people, interview them, work on job placement and housing. If 1 person a day gets into an entry-level job and averages $1500/yr in taxes, that would be $547,500/yr paid into the system. We make 10x return on our investment.
965692174745530368 2018-02-19 20:58:50 UTC <JHWhitley> Anybody think it's time for a third party yet? Or do you want to keep doing the same shit, having the same shit happening over and over again, so you can keep bitching about the same old shit?
965687150338482176 2018-02-19 20:38:52 UTC <JHWhitley> America has a "lesser of two evils" mentality when voting, even when there's a third option. If people voted for what they believed in, instead of against who they hate the most, we'd be better off.  Vote independent to break the Washington stalemate so we can move forward.

965684830401736704 2018-02-19 20:29:39 UTC <JHWhitley> @Crockpot1994 ha lol, maybe by then you can choose a better party. At the current flip-flop nature of the two party system, I predict Dems from 2020-2028 & GOP 2028-2032. We always get mad at one party and switch to the other, hoping things will be different this time...
965682616266403840 2018-02-19 20:20:51 UTC <JHWhitley> Instead of arbitrarily raising minimum wage, let's raise the standard of education so that no high school graduate has to accept minimum wage. #LivingWage
965682517415047168 2018-02-19 20:20:28 UTC <JHWhitley> Some corporations pay (lobby, the legal way to bribe) politicians to maintain the status quo. Some politicians are more interested in lining their pockets than helping the people who elected them to represent them. Can you spot them? Before they take office that is...
965682517012504576 2018-02-19 20:20:28 UTC <JHWhitley> Next election, don't vote for the lesser of two evils. That's how we got here. As many people who thought Hillary was the lesser, just as many thought the same of Trump. Thus, those who submit to the "lesser of two evils" mentality drown out those voting for what they believe.
965682322816221184 2018-02-19 20:19:41 UTC <JHWhitley> For this country to be the best it can be, we need everyone involved.  To this end, women need to be educated, empowered, and in charge of their own destiny! Retweet if you agree and spread the message!
965682202750066688 2018-02-19 20:19:13 UTC <JHWhitley> When money flows from the poor to the rich, its called capitalism. When money flows from the rich to the poor, its called socialism. Which side of the flow are you on?

965682196370489344 2018-02-19 20:19:11 UTC <JHWhitley> A friend asked, why hydrogen over electric? The answer is electric cars takes at least an hour to charge. Hydrogen cars fuel up in less than 3 minutes. And most people are only environmentally responsible if its convenient.
965682180960657409 2018-02-19 20:19:08 UTC <JHWhitley> As a web developer, I believe coding should be taught in schools. It teaches critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving.  Something the memorize this crap youll never use in real life mentality of our current education system lacks.

965682173331177472 2018-02-19 20:19:06 UTC <JHWhitley> Electing leaders that piss on the %99 is a reflection of education. When you don't know anything, it's easy to lie to you. So download my video and show it to a dumbass you know. They wouldn't even know there's always more options if they just rely on the media to educate them.
965682155337629697 2018-02-19 20:19:01 UTC <JHWhitley> @Crockpot1994 What party are you going for?
965682063977234432 2018-02-19 20:18:40 UTC <JHWhitley> Education should not be about memorizing answers for a test. It should teach critical thinking, self-worth, and life skills.  You know, things needed for life after school. See more at https://jameswhitley.com/?Topic=7
965681746971828224 2018-02-19 20:17:24 UTC <JHWhitley> If your house is on fire, you don't invite people to come live with you. Immigration reform is important, but let's see if we can get our own people off the streets first. Do that, immigration is easy. #ImmigrationReform
965681584681582592 2018-02-19 20:16:45 UTC <JHWhitley> A divided nation is easy for congress to ignore. When elected official in a two party race get elected by only a 1% difference, that official has the mentality that no matter what they do, half the people are for it, half are against.
965681568625782784 2018-02-19 20:16:42 UTC <JHWhitley> If the 99% wants to be represented in #Washington, they should elect someone capable of representing them.

965681285803855873 2018-02-19 20:15:34 UTC <JHWhitley> We have a severe mental health problem in America.

We need to address the why more so than the how if we ever want to stop it from happening.

963920706672115713 2018-02-14 23:39:39 UTC <JHWhitley> For this country to be the best it can be, we need everyone involved.  To this end, women need to be educated, empowered, and in charge of their own destiny! Retweet if you agree and spread the message!

No one whose life is going great, good, or even halfway decent, wakes up one day and decides to go kill a bunch of people. We need to address the why more so than the how if we ever want to stop it from happening.
963918399989411840 2018-02-14 23:30:29 UTC <JHWhitley> Instead of arbitrarily raising minimum wage, let's raise the standard of education so that no high school graduate has to accept minimum wage. #LivingWage
963918350207217665 2018-02-14 23:30:18 UTC <JHWhitley> Some corporations pay (lobby, the legal way to bribe) politicians to maintain the status quo.

963918316401127424 2018-02-14 23:30:10 UTC <JHWhitley> The future is coming. Several countries are building their own hydrogen economy. America must decide if we are going to drive the future, or play catch up.

963852738617475072 2018-02-14 19:09:35 UTC <JHWhitley> Pay a social worker $50,000/year to go find homeless people, interview them, work on job placement and housing. If 1 person a day gets into an entry-level job and averages $1500/yr in taxes, that would be $547,500/yr paid into the system. We make 10x return on our investment.

963846418958987264 2018-02-14 18:44:28 UTC <JHWhitley> America, this is what happens when you submit to the lesser of two evils mentality during elections We end up being represented by evil. Next time. vote for what you believe in, not against who you hate the most. RT if you agree and follow me.

If 1 person a day gets into an entry-level job and averages $1500/yr in taxes, that would be $547,500/yr paid into the system. We make 10x return on our investment.

958019615652630528 2018-01-29 16:50:50 UTC <JHWhitley> @realDonaldTrump Maybe from a rich man's point of view.  Seeing the stock market rise doesn't impress me. Seeing the homeless population decrease would.
957880604124618752 2018-01-28 07:38:27 UTC <JHWhitley> Getting people to follow what they've always known is easy. Educating them to the point they can choose a new path, that's hard.

957857663668252672 2018-01-28 06:07:17 UTC <JHWhitley> A friend asked, why hydrogen over electric? The answer is electric cars takes at least an hour to charge. Hydrogen cars fuel up in less than 3 minutes. And most people are only environmentally responsible if its convenient.

957663708783763456 2018-01-28 17:16:35 UTC <JHWhitley> @Synchronicity34 This will also benefit electric vehicles. After all, the major difference is adding a fuel cell and a tank. Millions of jobs will be created for this infrastructure and the manufacture the components for them. And that's one of the reasons for this...

957043755919532032 2018-01-26 00:13:07 UTC <JHWhitley> @Calautti4potus Hey Bobby,  Lets have a debate. You, me, and a few other independent candidates. Well can ask our follows to ask questions. This will help us all with exposure.  Well do it over Skype then upload the whole thing to YouTube.
957026845496557570 2018-01-26 23:05:55 UTC <JHWhitley> Is a vote for a third party a wasted vote? You tell me. Is your opinion a waste? #ThirdParty #Independent
957017286736400384 2018-01-26 22:27:56 UTC <JHWhitley> If the 99% wants to be represented in #Washington, they should elect someone capable of representing them. Someone who lives as they do, pays the same taxes they do, and has the same health care options they do. Like mehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVhvAPa08SU
957011899832401920 2018-01-26 22:06:31 UTC <JHWhitley> Exercise: Assume the next President, and America, is behind the single payer system for healthcare.  You are tasked with figuring out how much it will cost taxpayers opposed to how much medical insurance cost them now. Message me if youre up to the challenge.
957007915985981440 2018-01-26 21:50:42 UTC <JHWhitley> Next election, don't vote for the lesser of two evils. That's how we got here. As many people who thought Hillary was the lesser, just as many thought the same of Trump. Thus, those who submit to the "lesser of two evils" mentality drown out those voting for what they believe.
957007521285156864 2018-01-26 21:49:08 UTC <JHWhitley> Pay a social worker $50,000/year to go find homeless people, interview them, work on job placement and housing. If 1 person a day gets into an entry-level job and averages $1500/yr in taxes, that would be $547,500/yr paid into the system. We make 10x return on our investment.
957007252757491712 2018-01-26 21:48:04 UTC <JHWhitley> For this country to be the best it can be, we need everyone involved.  To this end, women need to be educated, empowered, and in charge of their own destiny! Retweet if you agree and spread the message!

957007129772097537 2018-01-26 21:47:34 UTC <JHWhitley> America, this is what happens when you submit to the lesser of two evils mentality during elections We end up being represented by evil. Next time. vote for what you believe in, not against who you hate the most. RT if you agree and follow me.
957007126546673664 2018-01-26 21:47:33 UTC <JHWhitley> Education should not be about memorizing answers for a test. It should teach critical thinking, self-worth, and life skills.  You know, things needed for life after school. See more at https://jameswhitley.com/?Topic=7

956960896881864706 2018-01-26 18:43:51 UTC <JHWhitley> We have a severe mental health problem in America. No one whose life is going great, good, or even halfway decent, wakes up one day and decides to go kill a bunch of random people. We need to address the why more so than the how if we ever want to stop it from happening.

956166996315471872 2018-01-24 14:09:11 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders @SenJohnBarrasso Of course everyone will lose current coverage, and that 60% to 90% maybe if we feel like paying coverage is replace by 100% your bill is paid coverage. You also lose the monthly insurance premium.

The only group making billions on the current system is the insurance companies, who take in more than the pay out. So let's just pay in and keep the benefits for ourselves.
955974920625905664 2018-01-23 01:25:56 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders ... a bail-out, you pay for it. If you or a dependent ever does go to the hospital, the bill is many times what it should be as the hospital rolls the cost of unpaid account to current accounts. Half of all personal bankruptcy in America is medical bills...

952054873910120448 2018-01-12 05:49:04 UTC <JHWhitley> @MarkRuffalo Politicians who dont accept climate change do so because once you acknowledge it, people might expect you to do something about it.

951988041110904832 2018-01-12 01:23:30 UTC <JHWhitley> We have a severe mental health problem in America. No one whose life is going great, good, or even halfway decent, wakes up one day and decides to go kill a bunch of random people. We need to address the why more so than the how if we ever want to stop it from happening.

951987858381848576 2018-01-12 01:22:47 UTC <JHWhitley> The reason we are losing ground in the global market is our education system sucks! We've created a whole generation that's largely unprepared for real life. To fix this, we're going to need to make some changes. Go to https://jameswhitley.com?Topic=7jameswhitley.com/?Topic=7 to see what I have in mind.
951987850521624576 2018-01-12 01:22:45 UTC <JHWhitley> The future is coming. Several countries are building their own hydrogen economy. America must decide if we are going to drive the future, or play catch up.
951987322936991744 2018-01-12 01:20:39 UTC <JHWhitley> Next election, don't vote for the lesser of two evils. That's how we got here. As many people who thought Hillary was the lesser, just as many thought the same of Trump. Thus, those who submit to the "lesser of two evils" mentality drown out those voting for what they believe.
951987317589200896 2018-01-12 01:20:38 UTC <JHWhitley> America has a "lesser of two evils" mentality when voting, even when there's a third option. If people voted for what they believed in, instead of against who they hate the most, we'd be better off.  Vote independent to break the Washington stalemate so we can move forward.
951987065872371712 2018-01-12 01:19:38 UTC <JHWhitley> @SethAbramson How shocked is anybody, really? Bitching about Trump is not going to do much.  Come join me in the fight to put middle class in The White House!  https://www.jameswhitley.com/ Pass it along!
951927730475446272 2018-01-12 21:23:51 UTC <JHWhitley> Electing leaders that piss on the %99 is a reflection of education. When you don't know anything, it's easy to lie to you.

951921707475877888 2018-01-12 20:59:55 UTC <JHWhitley> If the 99% wants to be represented in Washington, they should elect someone capable of representing them.

That being said, vote independents in like Matt Woody! Because Republicans and Democrats represent their party, not the people.

947273073635528704 2017-12-30 01:07:54 UTC <JHWhitley> @StarTrek Location: Congress. Analysis: Nothing worth assimilating.
947272239443046400 2017-12-30 01:04:36 UTC <JHWhitley> @thehill I guess for someone who deals in "Alternative Facts", people focusing on the real ones would get annoying...
947250110517391361 2017-12-30 23:36:40 UTC <JHWhitley> @PopSci But we don't want to learn anything... Capitalism does not work when applied to healthcare because corporations have decided money is more valuable than human life.
947244879200993280 2017-12-30 23:15:52 UTC <JHWhitley> The powers that be like us divided so we dont unite against them.
947211238437740544 2017-12-30 21:02:12 UTC <JHWhitley> @CNNPolitics If Trump had told you what he was really going to do, would you have voted for him?  This is assuming Hillary would be honest too
947210821066788864 2017-12-30 21:00:32 UTC <JHWhitley> If Trump had told you what he was really going to do, would you have voted for him?  This is assuming Hillary would have been honest too
947194427830931456 2017-12-30 19:55:24 UTC <JHWhitley> Bitching about Trump it's not going to do much. Come join me and the fight to put middle class in the White House.
947193956848332802 2017-12-30 19:53:31 UTC <JHWhitley> @Alyssa_Milano Yep, he's a hypocrite, but bitching about it's not going to help. Come join me and the fight to put middle class in the White House.
946996550512898050 2017-12-29 06:49:06 UTC <JHWhitley> @JoyAnnReid This is why I'm running now and not in 30 years when one's mind is not as sharp.
946979869916790784 2017-12-29 05:42:49 UTC <JHWhitley> Capitalism does not work when applied to healthcare because corporations have decided money is more valuable than human life.
946951667861377025 2017-12-29 03:50:45 UTC <JHWhitley> @lgbtqnation So, if I'm elected, AZT becomes available to anyone who needs it under the single payer system. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zidovudine

946804625046466561 2017-12-29 18:06:28 UTC <JHWhitley> Q: Isn't fuel cell technology expensive?  A: Yes, because we don't mass produced them yet. If we build a couple factories and put people to work making them, price will fall.
946584110553845761 2017-12-28 03:30:13 UTC <JHWhitley> @thehill Yep, thats why Im running in 2020. Seems unlikely but it beats doing nothing. Check outhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVhvAPa08SU

946556833220694016 2017-12-28 01:41:49 UTC <JHWhitley> @bfraser747 Simplicity is not the American political systems way. We ought to be able to vote online, one social security number, one vote.  If you think it can't be done, know that I'm a web developer and give me your best argument.
946554004787654656 2017-12-28 01:30:35 UTC <JHWhitley> @CNNPolitics So does this mean he believes in global warming?
946536511830413312 2017-12-28 00:21:04 UTC <JHWhitley> @sciam A frightening number of Americans lack the intellectual capacity to understand science.
946517172049891328 2017-12-28 23:04:13 UTC <JHWhitley> @CNNPolitics It's all about the calculation. https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm Look at who counted.
946508504919085057 2017-12-28 22:29:47 UTC <JHWhitley> @sciam Guns don't commit crimes, people do. You might as well try to take away knives, pressure cookers, piano wire, rental trucks, antifreeze, and so many other things.
946496607494733826 2017-12-28 21:42:30 UTC <JHWhitley> @peacock4ca42 @Christo52317208 No child left behind... the flip side being no child gets ahead. We've created an entire generation that think all they need to do is show up and they get their participation check. This is why we're losing ground in the world economy.
946494616261611521 2017-12-28 21:34:36 UTC <JHWhitley> @peacock4ca42 Right on, we need some more education in government...
946492132445118465 2017-12-28 21:24:44 UTC <JHWhitley> @DailySignal @EmilyMiller @LoneAmerican Then help me get the word out! Tell everyone you know. Because the media won't.  And the Dems and GOP want America to think they only have the two options they have selected.
946438971789365251 2017-12-28 17:53:29 UTC <JHWhitley> @DailySignal @EmilyMiller Promoting a mentally healthy society not profitable... This is why I'm focusing on the economy, education, and health care. Fix those 3 things and you drastically improve the nations mental state.
946434581607174145 2017-12-28 17:36:02 UTC <JHWhitley> @DailySignal @EmilyMiller We have a severe mental health problem in America. No one whose life is going great, good, or even halfway decent, wakes up one day and decides to go kill a bunch of random people. We need to address the why more so than the how if we ever want to stop it from happening.
946236283956932611 2017-12-27 04:28:04 UTC <JHWhitley> @thedailybeast @ALT_uscis More illegal immigration.... Solution, offer them citizenship if they pass a background check, then hold a job for two years and pay 20% in income taxes. Instead of $12 billion deporting, were making more than twice that.

946217464479801344 2017-12-27 03:13:18 UTC <JHWhitley> @Alyssa_Milano When Trump said Drain the swamps,  I guess we should have asked him what his definition of "swamp" was.
946160618779959298 2017-12-27 23:27:24 UTC <JHWhitley> So, I've heard that white christian men feel oppressed.  Anyone care to expand on that?
946142579111989248 2017-12-27 22:15:43 UTC <JHWhitley> @KatyTurNBC When you can't dispute the evidence, attack the credibility..,
946134777484267520 2017-12-27 21:44:43 UTC <JHWhitley> @realDonaldTrump I see what you're trying to do, enticing corporations  back to the US with lower taxes. But I, and many others, will be shocked if that actually works.
946058992337473538 2017-12-27 16:43:35 UTC <JHWhitley> @neiltyson Our school system is set up to turn out factory workers, not intellectuals. Problem is, without intellectuals thinking of ways to innovate and create new things, we have nothing for those factory workers to do.
945937208762093568 2017-12-27 08:39:39 UTC <JHWhitley> @jonnysun Every life changing moment starts as a dream. Dreams are the foundation of progress.
945916780324769793 2017-12-26 07:18:29 UTC <JHWhitley> @Alyssa_Milano Really? They can only spring for 152 Gigabytes of space?  More like they don't want a record. People do realize that twitter does save every single one, right?
945914008581951488 2017-12-26 07:07:28 UTC <JHWhitley> @nytimes America, we need to get with the program before we are the only first world country left that is dependent on third world countries for energy.

945888434077552640 2017-12-26 05:25:51 UTC <JHWhitley> @michikokakutani If you can make the people not believe the press, it becomes easier to lie to them. No one to fact check the establishment.
945845086256066560 2017-12-26 02:33:36 UTC <JHWhitley> @MSNBC When Trump said Drain the swamps, we thought he meant getting rid of government corruption.  What he really meant was getting rid people trying to get rid of government corruption.
945843946411954176 2017-12-26 02:29:04 UTC <JHWhitley> @goldengateblond The elderly are among the GOPs next targets. But they will wait until after the next election to dissolve social security.
945834833120514048 2017-12-26 01:52:51 UTC <JHWhitley> @Alyssa_Milano We need to expand the hydrogen economy across the nation. And Im probably the only presidential wannabe who wants it.
945817846776516609 2017-12-26 00:45:21 UTC <JHWhitley> Education should not be about memorizing answers for a test. It should teach critical thinking, self-worth, and life skills.  You know, things needed for life after school.

945089561885102080 2017-12-24 00:31:25 UTC <JHWhitley> @jayrosen_nyu Every president learns on the job. Experience in Washington just means you know how to do things the same ways they've always been done.  If you want to do something different, you can't use that. Problem is, he's still trying to act like an 80s GOP guy.

945063439663337473 2017-12-24 22:47:37 UTC <JHWhitley> @billmaher Religion is the root of all evil. Not for the values it tries to teach, but for the way men twist it to justify their own agenda.

That being said, This allows censorship of the internet.  There will be nothing preventing a corporation, or government, from dictating what you see. So look me up while you still can.
944684422615494656 2017-12-23 21:41:32 UTC <JHWhitley> @Marina_Sirtis @KaivanShroff Almost every president does this. The people are second thought, or no thought...

944339672561520641 2017-12-22 22:51:37 UTC <JHWhitley> @Alyssa_Milano @hope_melinda Only the president can order the military out of the middle east. And without doing that, theres no money to reinvest in our infrastructure. Or for anything else

No, those are just the people they have to lie to.

940658347694424064 2017-12-12 19:03:21 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders For most people, college is not the best idea. It puts you so far into debt that youre paying more than the pay benefit for the job that you might get because of a degree.  Government reimbursement of a trade school providing tuition you graduate is a better deal. In my opinion.

940430531887599616 2017-12-11 03:58:05 UTC <JHWhitley> @WilfredB96 Hey, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVhvAPa08SU
940429237139525632 2017-12-11 03:52:57 UTC <JHWhitley> @SarahKSilverman @comic_mischief @scottatron17 Then let's clean house, no re-elections in 2018.  If Congress lets this behavior slide, let's replace them all.
940398434766479361 2017-12-11 01:50:33 UTC <JHWhitley> @CNNPolitics He'll just pardon himself...
940398186157563905 2017-12-11 01:49:33 UTC <JHWhitley> @SarahKSilverman @comic_mischief @Darth_the_kitty Yea, they do that to me too even when I bring my registration card with me. "Sorry, we can't find you in the system."
940385948851896322 2017-12-11 01:00:56 UTC <JHWhitley> @NBCPolitics This is BS fake loose logic to disguise and promote an agenda of discrimination and hate.
940384382669307906 2017-12-11 00:54:42 UTC <JHWhitley> @CNNPolitics Politics is never explained. It's designed to confuse as many people as possible.
940368055493890054 2017-12-11 23:49:50 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSchumer If the 99% wants to be represented in Washington,  maybe they should elect someone capable of representing them. Someone who lives as they do, pays the same taxes they do, and has the same health care options they do.  Like me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVhvAPa08SU
940321565044076551 2017-12-11 20:45:06 UTC <JHWhitley> @TeaPainUSA Anyone running for office should have to take a polygraph test on shit like this.
940319645369864193 2017-12-11 20:37:28 UTC <JHWhitley> @ChrisCoxNRA @NRA @2Smithd Yes.
940309956124962816 2017-12-11 19:58:58 UTC <JHWhitley> @ChrisCoxNRA @NRA @RichHickey1 I'll bet, knowing that right now in that area only those willing to break the law have guns...
940309272663085056 2017-12-11 19:56:15 UTC <JHWhitley> @ChrisCoxNRA @NRA Heres my stance: I believe all law abiding citizens should be able to have all the guns they want, and be able to carry them openly or concealed. But if you got a record of violence, youve demonstrated a reason not to let you have them.
940308776615383041 2017-12-11 19:54:17 UTC <JHWhitley> @NBCPolitics And thats how the establishment chooses your president.
940308683027820545 2017-12-11 19:53:54 UTC <JHWhitley> @NBCPolitics Next election, dont vote for the lesser of two evils. Thats how we got here. As many people who thought Hillary was the lesser, just as many thought the same of Trump. Then, those who submit to the lesser of two evils mentality drown out those voting for what they believe.
940266466091438083 2017-12-11 17:06:09 UTC <JHWhitley> @ProgrammingWrld As a web developer, I believe coding should be taught in schools. It teaches critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving.  Something the memorize this crap youll never use in real life mentality of our current education system lacks.

940040082601361409 2017-12-10 02:06:35 UTC <JHWhitley> @SarahKSilverman @p_hanger Its both. Republicans and Democrats are two sides of the same coin, different wings belonging to the same bird, and so on.
940028326608961536 2017-12-10 01:19:52 UTC <JHWhitley> @SarahKSilverman @comic_mischief @adrock33 haha, no. But if you think you can do better, you should run.

940010504373796864 2017-12-10 00:09:03 UTC <JHWhitley> @SarahKSilverman @comic_mischief It is, "real issues" covers many things, so I thought I would also spell it out at the end.
939996865097097218 2017-12-10 23:14:51 UTC <JHWhitley> @SarahKSilverman Racism is a tool use by the establishment to distract us from the real issues, keep us fighting amongst ourselves, and to keep the minorities down.
939995276881874944 2017-12-10 23:08:32 UTC <JHWhitley> @TeaPainUSA I hope America is still here in 2020
939992647275548673 2017-12-10 22:58:05 UTC <JHWhitley> @SeanTrende @S_G_Alexander Democrats are the party of no initiative and Republicans are the party of bad actions.

939966796853141505 2017-12-10 21:15:22 UTC <JHWhitley> @ProgrammingWrld @Science__Newz We have a severe mental health problem in America. No one whos life is going great, good, or even half-way decent, wakes up one day and decides to go kill a bunch of people. We need to address the why more so than the how if we ever want to stop it from happening.
939966346586181633 2017-12-10 21:13:35 UTC <JHWhitley> I was asked the question Why dont you start off small, like Mayor? Because only the president can order the military out of the middle east. And without doing that, theres no money to reinvest in our infrastructure. Or for anything else
939956227718729729 2017-12-10 20:33:22 UTC <JHWhitley> @johnpavlovitz @Amy_Siskind Trump not going to resign, his Gang Of Predators has his back.
939954673682911232 2017-12-10 20:27:12 UTC <JHWhitley> @NBCPolitics We need the number of independents to rise. The Republicans and Democrats spend so much time fighting, nothing gets done. This, and other reasons, is why Im running in 2020. Seems unlikely but it beats doing nothing. Check outhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVhvAPa08SU

939714932303593472 2017-12-09 04:34:33 UTC <JHWhitley> @CNNPolitics When Trump said Drain the swamps, we thought he meant getting rid of unethical people.  What he really meant was getting rid ethical people and add more unethical people.
939711183317291008 2017-12-09 04:19:39 UTC <JHWhitley> @CNNPolitics When America has lost the ability to dream, weve also lost the ability to be great.

939709126560579584 2017-12-09 04:11:29 UTC <JHWhitley> @realDonaldTrump @johnpavlovitz This is what they do, the Republicans and Democrats, rolling back everything the previous party did,  and somehow making things worse the before those policies ever existed. It's a vicious cycle.

939638989849493505 2017-12-09 23:32:47 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders Maybe if we werent throwing money in the sand box, cutting taxes for the rich, paying off harassment suits, we wouldnt have to shut down the government.
939396243100524544 2017-12-08 07:28:12 UTC <JHWhitley> @NormOrnstein @RBReich This is why we need someone who can represent the 99%, like me. Or we can keep electing from the same old swamp and somehow expect change.
939345301764177920 2017-12-08 04:05:46 UTC <JHWhitley> @Nataliew1020 I plan to make healthcare available to all who pay taxes and their dependents. I hear you.

938440271276191746 2017-12-06 16:09:30 UTC <JHWhitley> @php_net Before I submit a bug, has anyone had a hanging problem with the ODBC calls from 5.6.31 on?  Scripts run fine with simultaneous multiple connections in 5.6.30 and lower, but .31 they run 1 at a time. I've even copied the php ini file from .30 into .31

938397451479904257 2017-12-06 13:19:21 UTC <JHWhitley> @TheDailyShow America, this is what happens when you submit to the lesser of two evils mentality during elections
938275170254512129 2017-12-05 05:13:27 UTC <JHWhitley> @JeriLRyan They were all thinking, "Glad the heat's on you and not me..."
938188159791304704 2017-12-05 23:27:42 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders Ever think Trump is running some get richer scam? And we're the mark.
938181946823331840 2017-12-05 23:03:01 UTC <JHWhitley> I'm tired of grumpy old white men fucking up my country. How about you?
938113391142604800 2017-12-05 18:30:36 UTC <JHWhitley> Next election, dont vote for the lesser of two evils. Thats how we got here. As many people who thought Hillary was the lesser, just as many thought the same of Trump. Then, those who submit to the lesser of two evils mentality drown out those voting for what they believe.
938110279392661509 2017-12-05 18:18:14 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders @sheholdsasmile I second that, even though Ill be running against the Dems in 2020.  Which may not be you as we know from 2016 they do not want what you are selling and will probably have their super delegates vote for someone more in line with their views
938108638962515971 2017-12-05 18:11:43 UTC <JHWhitley> @ananavarro And thats how the establishment chooses your president for you.

938076585059586048 2017-12-05 16:04:21 UTC <JHWhitley> @TheDailyShow @TTopperr I did vote for the other guy (Johnson ) simple because I didn't like the others. People said I was wasting my vote, but at least I didn't submit to "The lesser of two evils."
937904073063501824 2017-12-04 04:38:51 UTC <JHWhitley> @TheDailyShow When Trump said Drain the swamps, we thought he meant getting rid of unethical people.  What he really meant was getting rid ethical people and add more unethical people.

935247250095247361 2017-11-27 20:41:35 UTC <JHWhitley> @karel_erion @_Dave__M @comcast So, if you support the principles of net neutrality, why do you want to make it so you have the option to violate those principles?
935239361356075008 2017-11-27 20:10:14 UTC <JHWhitley> @comcast I hear what your saying, it's just that the American people have learned not to trust corporations...
934921002672418816 2017-11-26 23:05:11 UTC <JHWhitley> @harikondabolu @TheDailyShow Its not so much the lack of representation causing racism.  Its the abundance of idiots.
934908560869339136 2017-11-26 22:15:45 UTC <JHWhitley> @neiltyson They can always re-work the physics to make a flat earth cast the shadows we see... lol:)
934893950636355584 2017-11-26 21:17:41 UTC <JHWhitley> @Interdictors As a web developer, and someone who believes in the first amendment, I can tell you it opens the door for censorship of the internet.  As a presidential candidate for 2020, I can guarantee this shit wont stand.

934857551467991040 2017-11-26 18:53:03 UTC <JHWhitley> @cnnbrk Men will keep doing what they think they can get away with. Report it immediately.
934814990657343488 2017-11-26 16:03:56 UTC <JHWhitley> @CNN We no-longer exercise our brains. Setting in front of the TV watching the same crap rehashed, staying at the same job for 40 years,  never taking the time to learn anything new.

934439932801814528 2017-11-25 15:13:35 UTC <JHWhitley> @2chainz @TheDailyShow If the 99% wants to be represented in Washington,  maybe they should elect someone capable of representing them. Someone who lives as they do, pays the same taxes they do, and has the same grievances they do.

934186629790601216 2017-11-24 22:27:03 UTC <JHWhitley> @SouthPark I have an episode idea for you. Politicians from the future come back in time to stop the election of an independent president as its bad for business.
934136683662016512 2017-11-24 19:08:35 UTC <JHWhitley> @airliquidegroup @riversimple The future is coming. America must decide if we are going to drive the future or try to run from it.
934109869824724992 2017-11-24 17:22:02 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders I use to live in Kansas and rented a house for $250 a month, while making $8.25 an hour.  I was doing just fine for the locations cost of living.
934107267984777221 2017-11-24 17:11:42 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders I respectfully disagree. If you want a $15 an hour job, go get yourself a $15 an hour job.
933745743202062336 2017-11-23 17:15:07 UTC <JHWhitley> @michiokaku Sarcasm aside, we do need to address the lack of education in this country. Im not sure if these people are that dumb or just desperate to belong to a group that will accept them which is a different kind of dumb.
933473103409278976 2017-11-22 23:11:45 UTC <JHWhitley> @TomSteyer @FigVilleUSA @vision4america I agree
933464190622273537 2017-11-22 22:36:20 UTC <JHWhitley> If the 99% wants to be represented in Washington,  maybe they should elect someone capable of representing them. Someone who lives as they do, pays the same taxes they do, and has the same grievances they do.
933452357328887808 2017-11-22 21:49:19 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders Ah politics, maybe the 99% should elect someone capable of representing them, not someone whos known money there entire life.  Who did you think he was going to make America great again for?
933383059600224257 2017-11-22 17:13:57 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders The republicans long term war on public education is paying off. A lot of people are ignorant of the many ways they are being screwed over. Meanwhile, in private school, you learn how to do the screwing
933371594298322944 2017-11-22 16:28:23 UTC <JHWhitley> @TomSteyer @NextGenAmerica @ffmedic402 Thats why Im running as an independent in 2020. I dont believe either party represents the people.
933098666998374400 2017-11-21 22:23:53 UTC <JHWhitley> @elainemsheldon @TheDailyShow The silver bullet is to have a government invested in the peoples welfare, not the wealthy campaign donors pocket.

933086421656711168 2017-11-21 21:35:13 UTC <JHWhitley> @TomSteyer @NextGenAmerica Hey republicans, if you would stop throwing money into the sandbox, you wouldnt have to raise taxes.

932397226864840708 2017-11-19 23:56:36 UTC <JHWhitley> @BillGates I intend to fix both the healthcare situation and the environmental contributors to those problems.  But I have to run as an independent in 2020 because both the democrats and republicans parties dont seem to care.
932085385085243392 2017-11-18 03:17:27 UTC <JHWhitley> @neiltyson Nope. If they had the capacity to be impressed, it would be like a child walking is to us.
932067645301690368 2017-11-18 02:06:58 UTC <JHWhitley> @TomSteyer @bigdsvp This is why I am running as an independent for 2020. Neither the Republicans nor Democrats seem to be able to formulate a good idea.
931666665053605889 2017-11-17 23:33:37 UTC <JHWhitley> So, to be perfectly clear, I am running for president to get our military out of the middle-east above all other objectives. Pass this along to anyone you feel may also have this goal.
931404617958805505 2017-11-16 06:12:20 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders This is one of the reasons we need to invest in the hydrogen economy.
931336969078046721 2017-11-16 01:43:31 UTC <JHWhitley> @KHOU @JoaquinCastrotx I miss the freedom of speech we used to have.  When you didnt have to worry about reprisal from the government, your job, or fellow Americans just for speaking your mind.

930852660366004226 2017-11-15 17:39:03 UTC <JHWhitley> @SenSanders I believe we need to develop the hydrogen economy across the nation. That would help the environment, create jobs, and eliminate our biggest reason for being in the middle east.

928842067828191232 2017-11-09 04:29:40 UTC <JHWhitley> @AntiwarMN I like your stance on endless wars. Im doing what I can by running for president specifically to get us out of war. Im not a corrupt politician or billionaire so its a long shot, but it beats doing nothing.

926114062383099905 2017-11-02 15:49:33 UTC <JHWhitley> @TomSteyer Congress serves the rich and most of the rich love him, so I doubt congress is going to impeach him.
