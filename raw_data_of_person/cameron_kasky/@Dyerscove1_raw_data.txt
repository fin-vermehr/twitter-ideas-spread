I am 100% a supporter of March for Our Lives and am very proud of all the kids out there making their voices heard. I am just confused about how those  donations are being used. I thought the kids would be getting financial support for projects.

964707648162664455 2018-02-16 03:46:41 UTC <Dyerscove1> @schoolwalkoutUS One tweet announced that kids are walking out and not returning until congress acts. I hope that is not the plan.

951117153700335616 2018-01-10 15:42:55 UTC <Dyerscove1> @TimpSnyder Since the entire Golden Globes night was dedicated to Time's Up, I would think Franco and every other male celeb would have been doing a lot of soul searching and be way more prepared to discuss the issues  in an interview. Franco looked like a jerk.
