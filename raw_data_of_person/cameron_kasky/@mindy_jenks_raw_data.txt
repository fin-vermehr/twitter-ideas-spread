I'm glad I engaged with this account though, to see what was being thrown at me. Everyone should be held accountable. Seems like you all are owed an apology, at the least.
956023814760124416 2018-01-23 04:40:14 UTC <mindy_jenks> @DMWeisberg @cbzakin @theskimm @altskimm For sure. Otherwise it just seemed like an attack out of nowhere, which is the opposite of what you're trying to achieve here, or else you'd just be another one of "them," right? Putting your stories out there will catch attention, (I know it would mine) rather than tweets coming
956022237122920448 2018-01-23 04:33:58 UTC <mindy_jenks> @theskimm @altskimm Ooooooh. This makes sense now. I thought this was some weird bot-account I was talking with. So, you (6) were skimmB's and got burned....how? What happened and why are there 3 people still going along with it? That's what you should be tweeting out! It would make way more sense.
956020557891416064 2018-01-23 04:27:17 UTC <mindy_jenks> @theskimm @altskimm Your account seems a bit of a double-edge sword. I like exposure, especially if humans are being violated through a news source. But isn't your extreme stance on this better spent calling HQ with your complaints, and/or WAY MORE credible news outlets that get away with WAY worse?
956019538402963456 2018-01-23 04:23:14 UTC <mindy_jenks> @theskimm @altskimm Alright man, idk why you are bombarding me with all of this! I don't work for theSkimm lol. You are crazy mad, and I get why. In fact, I agree with you about what you showed being tasteless. But do you have accounts like this for Fox News etc etc etc?
956010051000352769 2018-01-23 03:45:32 UTC <mindy_jenks> @altskimm Personally, I like to get my news from a large amount of outlets. When a topic comes up that I have an opinion on, I can voice it aloud bc I have done my research. @theskimm isn't "fake news" or "alt facts" -- it just isn't to your liking, and that is OK. You do get that, right?
