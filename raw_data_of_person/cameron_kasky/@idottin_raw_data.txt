905212770538450945 2017-09-05 23:35:17 UTC <idottin> @DionnaFilm Yes ma'am!!!
892422566337552384 2017-08-01 16:31:34 UTC <idottin> @mic @SarahLerner @kevion . . Dems also failed tackle mass incarceration, failed to reform immigration (senate passed bill, house stalled it), failed with DACA . . .
892421788575178754 2017-08-01 16:28:29 UTC <idottin> @mic @SarahLerner @kevion Oh yeah. Dems are nothing but failures. Failed to pass Obamacare, failed to get Bin Laden, failed to lower unemployment . . . While Bernie?
892192340789518336 2017-07-31 01:16:44 UTC <idottin> @mic @SarahLerner Bernie and his people drag Democrats more than they do Republicans . . . And they're going ask for our support in 2020? Please.

888373137292873732 2017-07-21 12:20:35 UTC <idottin> @AdamParkhomenko A combustible mix when you add ppl in his administration who champion a brazen dismantling of government.

883835037015265280 2017-07-08 23:47:48 UTC <idottin> @RedWallPro Bruh, days like these we need as much joy as possible. Check out ya boy at 1:21https://twitter.com/TomHall/status/883466627710279681
878463536464265216 2017-06-23 04:03:22 UTC <idottin> @TheTattooedProf @AviralKapoor_ Exactly!
878101434784514050 2017-06-22 04:04:31 UTC <idottin> @played_straight Do it! I'll send you some cash!
878097860931334144 2017-06-22 03:50:18 UTC <idottin> @played_straight Very true. I hope Dems will take lessons from the L's they took in the last two special elections.
878097557603311616 2017-06-22 03:49:06 UTC <idottin> @played_straight I'm with you. I'm a big supporter of Oregon's dedication to having everyone participate in the election process.
878095207727636480 2017-06-22 03:39:46 UTC <idottin> @played_straight Oh indeed!!
878095115868295168 2017-06-22 03:39:24 UTC <idottin> @played_straight True. First we take the House. Then we change the culture b/c there will be so many of us. Then we box fascists like Steve King out.
878094402253504512 2017-06-22 03:36:34 UTC <idottin> @played_straight That's why resistance is so important and why we've gotta vote at midterms. Typically we drag our feet when it comes to midterm voting.
878094021327020038 2017-06-22 03:35:03 UTC <idottin> @played_straight Totally agree. Dems gotta be Dems and not Republican lites. And we have to be more aggressive with our priorities and sell effectively.
878093570762211329 2017-06-22 03:33:16 UTC <idottin> @played_straight Given good candidates, and continued resistance Dems can take over the House.
878093291605983232 2017-06-22 03:32:09 UTC <idottin> @played_straight Saw #'s on special elections said that since they started it and only 6 districts total have flipped.
878092681355907074 2017-06-22 03:29:44 UTC <idottin> @played_straight True. The danger is since FDR, GOP's #1 goal is to destroy The New Deal. With Trump as prez and control of Congress, this is their chance
878091423291121664 2017-06-22 03:24:44 UTC <idottin> @played_straight GOP trying to burn it all down, but some senators are cracking. This bill will be political suicide for GOP Senators in purple districts.
878088812982874112 2017-06-22 03:14:21 UTC <idottin> @played_straight A lot of respect for you . . . But I'm not eulogizing the ACA yet. The resistance is still out there throwing roadblocks.
877917264011571201 2017-06-22 15:52:41 UTC <idottin> @DavidNir @lewisvp They are not about service.
877911645762093057 2017-06-22 15:30:21 UTC <idottin> @DavidNir @lewisvp Exactly - On top of that all this left wing pearl clutching at GA06's loss plays into the idea  liberals have no spine. Get to work libs!
877862034095910912 2017-06-22 12:13:13 UTC <idottin> @GeeDee215 @AviralKapoor_ Exactly.
875031777177481217 2017-06-14 16:46:47 UTC <idottin> @DionnaFilm You know how we do!
