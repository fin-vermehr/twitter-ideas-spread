969792438901522432 2018-03-02 04:31:49 UTC <cmagdaleno> Just finished my first #featurefilm script ever. A zombie-horror period drama about the price of faith in desperate times.  Now to celebrate - and #rewrite!  #screenwriting #writerslife #happyfridaypic.twitter.com/V7rxVUSV35
969056837357228033 2018-02-28 03:48:48 UTC <cmagdaleno> Watching the debut of #WereAlive Frontier! So proud of @waylandprod and the continuing evolution https://www.instagram.com/p/BfxB4ehD8QC/
967984016388272131 2018-02-25 04:45:48 UTC <cmagdaleno> @whatbitcoindid Yeah, thats a bit how I feel about a lot of the platform tokens and utility tokens. They feel a bit more like the stocks than the currencies of the future
967919965440372741 2018-02-25 00:31:17 UTC <cmagdaleno> @davidsirota re: job search - have you considered writing some posts on @steemit? Its like Medium, made w/ blockchain tech that lets users make money directly from others based on quality/popularity of content.  I think your work would be appreciated by the crypto community!
967915525136203777 2018-02-25 00:13:38 UTC <cmagdaleno> @whatbitcoindid Do you think improvements to Bitcoin overtime will wipe out micropayment coins like Litecoin or Stellar, or will one of those - or one like them - have a place as well?
967912338488619009 2018-02-25 00:00:59 UTC <cmagdaleno> Really appreciate this honest look at the immediate future of BTC price by @Bitraged.  I wonder if the market will start bull run at $5k retest w/ whales expecting it to be the double bottom; sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy.https://twitter.com/bitraged/status/967875368509112320

964710399248621568 2018-02-16 03:57:37 UTC <cmagdaleno> @TheYoungTurks Happy #SweetSixteen @theyoungturks! Had a great and inspiring time at the party/rally last night https://www.instagram.com/p/BfSJWSdjuIa/
963115070094897152 2018-02-12 18:18:21 UTC <cmagdaleno> Do the concept short film or a web series before the feature, maybe just an EP or a really great single before the 13-track LP.  Just start something and finish it. The ability to do that consistently is probably 70% of the difference between amateurs and pros.  #NotesToSelfhttps://twitter.com/mitchgerads/status/962447832463564800

954169180835598336 2018-01-18 01:50:34 UTC <cmagdaleno> When youre in the voting booth in 2018, remember that @realDonaldTrump & the @GOP needlessly said, Either get rid of the foreign children or we let YOUR children die.  Remember that they wanna fight terrorists and yet have held American lives hostage throughout this admin.
949044396065898496 2018-01-04 22:26:31 UTC <cmagdaleno> Great point. If the art is undeniably good, the business almost grows itself. If not, it might be a rough go.  Nearly every artistic market today is too saturated to accept mediocre efforts from any of us; but we also get more credit for artistic courage & business discipline.https://twitter.com/aristake/status/948782061250375680
947959848175415296 2018-01-01 22:36:54 UTC <cmagdaleno> I would argue the same goes for makers and doers everywhere. Its a great time to be alive - we have the same hours as DiVinci and about a million times the resources.  Go get it this year. #NotesToSelfhttps://twitter.com/recordingrev/status/947944890327019520
947069027746070533 2017-12-30 11:37:06 UTC <cmagdaleno> @_bullandbear Cheers from the U.S.! Just wanted to say that I appreciate your earnest, insightful, and even-keeled perspective on this new landscape. Thanks for the daily updates and education via Youtube, it's seriously essential viewing. Keep up the great work.
946875206320062464 2017-12-29 22:46:55 UTC <cmagdaleno> If I had a nickel for every time a congressperson warned against voter fraud or voter suppression while supporting the right of multi-national corporations (w/ no allegiance to any country - only profit) to use money to influence elections, I, too, could buy a congressperson.
945000671945695232 2017-12-24 18:38:12 UTC <cmagdaleno> Dont Forget to Drink Your Ogletree.  My wife is the best at #FantasyFootball team names. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. #GoRams
944001492955959296 2017-12-21 00:27:49 UTC <cmagdaleno> I think the recent dip in Bitcoin is a result of current holders setting their positions in altcoins for 2018 and using other profits to invest in mining.  Thinking a bump after Christmas and in 2018 with each additional headline, especially as other cryptos hit the news.
943609369509339136 2017-12-20 22:29:39 UTC <cmagdaleno> The worst thing @realDonaldTrump could do for his re-electability is align himself with Republicans, and the worst thing the @GOP could do for theirs is align themselves with Trump.  2018 is gonna be fun.
941781643253112832 2017-12-15 21:26:55 UTC <cmagdaleno> Partly joking, but I think its pretty reasonable well see #Bitcoin and #Litecoin price spikes (at least on Coinbase) the Friday after the 1st and 15th of every month as knowledge/adoption spreads.
940798016587550721 2017-12-12 04:18:20 UTC <cmagdaleno> Despite their long and enduring disenfranchisement, women and minorities will win the day for justice & equality in America.  A special thanks to African Americans, who have consistently propelled America towards what it can be, at great risk and cost, including today in Alabama.
940791608290758658 2017-12-12 03:52:53 UTC <cmagdaleno> Big ups to my man, @realDonaldTrump, & to the @GOP for filling their ranks with corporate shills, pedophiles, and sexual harassers. You managed to turn an Alabama seat blue after 25 yrs; no doubt important in making America great again.  Please, just keep doing you. #Midterms2018
939749525748699137 2017-12-09 06:52:01 UTC <cmagdaleno> Given the short-sighted history of the financial establishment, I dont put it past big money to buy/sell massive amounts of #Bitcoin, along with futures on both ends; manipulating the price to their hearts content and undermining themselves & the coin along the way.pic.twitter.com/gbnnhWMS8v
938859914625138688 2017-12-07 19:57:01 UTC <cmagdaleno> Re: a #Bitcoin bubble - Bitcoin will see fluctuations but keep on rising. Whats really happening is not just the value of Bitcoin going up (from adoption), but the utility of fiat currencies going down. Bitcoin and block chain arent alternatives, theyre inevitabilities.
938116391487528960 2017-12-05 18:42:31 UTC <cmagdaleno> The @WSJ editorial board calling for Mueller to step down in favor of someone more credible, while not asking the same of @realDonaldTrump, is proof enough that they need to step down in favor of someone more credible.
937791262786121729 2017-12-04 21:10:35 UTC <cmagdaleno> @CryptoNickk hey, Im really getting a lot of value from your videos, thank you.   I was wondering, with regards to hashflare mining, do you think its better to reinvest mined coins or hold and let appreciate? My guess is do both? Cheers and thanks again!
936357059611602945 2017-11-30 22:11:34 UTC <cmagdaleno> The @GOP #taxbill will fail because Biz invests in #labor when it has a need for labor, NOT when it has more $ (corporations have more #profit than ever). With automation/outsourcing, demand only rises for the high-skilled workers #Americans literally cannot afford to become.
930888308594323456 2017-11-15 20:00:42 UTC <cmagdaleno> Yes!!! Last day of filming where I had trimmed my beard too short and had to color it in. Worked pretty good on camera given I looked like a chimney sweep on set. #GetSpy #Actinghttps://twitter.com/getspyshow/status/930611040433221632

915288816155426816 2017-10-03 18:53:53 UTC <cmagdaleno> Your move, @GOP and @DNC. Seriously, you guys are pushing people towards their torches and pitchforks with your corruption every day.https://twitter.com/beauwillimon/status/915264625930842112

908110604782551041 2017-09-13 23:30:14 UTC <cmagdaleno> @b_pecoraro For the record, single-payer college/trade schools would be next. People also aren't truly free when they NEED secondary education to live.
908109950106329088 2017-09-13 23:27:38 UTC <cmagdaleno> @b_pecoraro It makes no economic sense to pay middle men to give us "access" to healthcare. If we all pitch in we just pay for it ourselves.
908109789565149184 2017-09-13 23:27:00 UTC <cmagdaleno> @b_pecoraro Plus the government would be buying in bulk on our behalf; a la Costco. Right now it's big pharma/insurance that has the monopoly.
908109527328866304 2017-09-13 23:25:57 UTC <cmagdaleno> @b_pecoraro We'd all pitch in. The tax increase vs. reduction in insurance company costs & overhead to people/biz would = a net savings per payer/yr

906906514597617664 2017-09-10 15:45:37 UTC <cmagdaleno> @JoyAnnReid 100% over the media bashing the most popular politician in US 'cause THEIR candidate's only pitch was "I'm not DT." A literal POS is not DT.

709509485119692800 2016-03-14 22:40:17 UTC <cmagdaleno> @AnaKasparian @TYTLive @tytlive @anakasparian Bernie should have told that guy that he hopes he DOES go work for Wall Street - and reform it from the inside.
705918222353051648 2016-03-04 00:49:54 UTC <cmagdaleno> @TheYoungTurks Do you think Bernie's FOX News townhall could turn the election for him? He might be the GOP's best shot to beat Trump.
