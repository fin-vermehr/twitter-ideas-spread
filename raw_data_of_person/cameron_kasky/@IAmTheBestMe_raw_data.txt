971581395280760832 2018-03-07 03:00:30 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> It is amazing how priorities change. What used to matter so much is not even a blip on the radar anymore. That is life
971581072399101953 2018-03-07 02:59:13 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> Wow. It is Canada Music Week. I used to live for that. I waited all year in anticipation, spent hours planning what shows to catch...
971580504410554369 2018-03-07 02:56:58 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> I choose love. I choose compassion. And I choose forgiveness. Holding onto angry only hurts yourself. It is so freeing to let it gohttps://twitter.com/bunnybuddhism/status/966461008234598400

969417706696073216 2018-03-01 03:42:46 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> >: We all fall apart. We all have really bad days. I hate that hers was captured, shared and held up for ridicule. She is a mom. She has a child that had to endure that
969417427078516737 2018-03-01 03:41:40 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> I was so sad to see the mug shots of Heather locklear the other day. Unlike so many, I do not delight in this pics *sad face* >

969413816206454784 2018-03-01 03:27:19 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> On the plus side, the night is soft and quiet and the flakes are very pretty (I keep telling myself this ...)
969413650338459648 2018-03-01 03:26:39 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> It is snowing hard tonight. Big, fat, fluffy flakes of "oh god... this is going to be a bitch to shovel in the morning..."

967245199897448448 2018-02-23 03:50:00 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> @EvilBells I think she is going to turn out more Balinese than ragdoll. She is very lean and very vocal - which I love.

958914244799614976 2018-01-31 04:05:46 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> I am afraid I am a total fail as a cat mom. Everyone says to use a water bottle (with spray) to correct her behaviour, but it breaks my heart.

946428745400889344 2017-12-28 17:12:51 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> > Taking control of the "small stuff"-  how you behave and how you respond can make all the difference in a situation.
946428353338322946 2017-12-28 17:11:17 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> For example, if you are afraid of a reorganization at work - you have no control over that.. what you can control is your attitude and the quality of the work you do
946428001356566529 2017-12-28 17:09:53 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> Sometimes, I let stress, worry and "what might be" overwhelm me. I have learned to take a deep breath and let it go. Take control over what you can change and let the rest go.
946427526259380225 2017-12-28 17:08:00 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> One of my biggest lessons from 2017 - no amount of worry or angst can change the outcome.
946427165939306496 2017-12-28 17:06:34 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> I am seeing a lot of tweets about the biggest lesson people learned in 2017 and they are so profound and beautiful. Thank you sharing

940965312123559937 2017-12-13 15:23:07 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> @_alwaysbitchy I have found it protects the colour. I also use a vegan shampoo called Live Clean for colour (sulfate free) but I don't know if you can buy in U.S. I get a deep auburn colour (red violet) and I get it toned between colours to add more pigment.
940961226510749696 2017-12-13 15:06:53 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> @_alwaysbitchy Aveda Color/Conserve. Pricey, but worth every penny. LOVE! A little goes a long way. The shampoo is amazing too

917219728229371904 2017-10-08 02:46:38 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> The point is, this shit goes around and around and I have heard this story for so long now. Time for a new chapter...
917219307142156288 2017-10-08 02:44:58 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> On what always existed in the shadows. Silence gave cloud cover (and rightfully so, because those with stories would pay if they spoke)
917218915201290242 2017-10-08 02:43:25 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> There is always so much shock and hand wringing in the news when these things come to light. But the sun never lies.. It just shines a light
917218201620111360 2017-10-08 02:40:35 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> In the age of #Weinstein it is never ok.
917217910837391360 2017-10-08 02:39:25 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> Never let someone make you feels small or less. Or back you into a moral  corner, wanting something you are not prepared to share
917217600685395968 2017-10-08 02:38:11 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> No matter of where you are at, do not be afraid. If you are not treated with respect, kindness and honour, walk away

916471904877318144 2017-10-06 01:15:04 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> A creep is a creep is a creep. And a bully.
916471792696483841 2017-10-06 01:14:37 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> Toxic masculinity is not a political issue, it is a human issue. It is about the misuse of power. How we treat one another #Weinstein
916471388860542976 2017-10-06 01:13:00 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> Toxic masculinity happens on the left, the right, down the middle, in the church and in the schools. It is everywhere #Weinstein >

897650208485646337 2017-08-15 02:44:21 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> I am not willing to fall. I will stand up and I hope you will stand up too. xo Sunshine
897649796080689154 2017-08-15 02:42:43 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> This is not limited to one country, one society, one place. It is universal. One village, one community. we stand together or we all fall
897649108898508802 2017-08-15 02:39:59 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> I will not be afraid. And no one will silence my voice. I will scream it from the rooftops. I will holler from the trenches.
897648594056077316 2017-08-15 02:37:56 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> Silence and fear gives wings and roots to things that have no place in a true and just society. Find your voice and your courage
897648306964357120 2017-08-15 02:36:48 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> Evil prevailed in WW2 because good people stood by and were silent. Maybe they were afraid. But their silence gave permission.
897647884631367680 2017-08-15 02:35:07 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> I never, ever, thought I would live to see the day. When men were not afraid to show their ugly natures to the world. Bare faced, no fear
897647640942452736 2017-08-15 02:34:09 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> So much of what happened last weekend left me speechless. And with no sunshine

832459560208080896 2017-02-16 05:20:00 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> Not sure, I can move it, I am hoping it is just badly bruised and stiff. With my luck, it may be much worse.
832458923999236100 2017-02-16 05:17:28 UTC <IAmTheBestMe> I will give it a couple days of good stretching and see if it is just bruised or worse. Of course. I have to move at the same time
