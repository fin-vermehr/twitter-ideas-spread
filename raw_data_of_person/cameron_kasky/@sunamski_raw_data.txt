970713104823676928 2018-03-05 17:30:13 UTC <sunamski> @GonzaBear This type of headline is beneath you @TODAYshow and its shameful that you descended to rag-tabloid-junk. Making a shallow, sexist and cheap critique towards an accomplished and confident woman is why Im unfollowing you. #TimesUp #DoBetter #MeToo #SexistAndDumb
970179487563366400 2018-03-03 06:09:49 UTC <sunamski> @brianklaas @CMacCoille @Spillinsanity The CNN report says the latest is 35% and Gallup says on average since January 2017 is 38%. I said inserted ~ which means approximately. Your numbers are higher than either Gallups or CNNs latest reports.
