968205285851566086 2018-02-26 19:25:03 UTC <KateDahls> @PoliteIceCream Yes, sorry, I should have been more clear.
968204551441526785 2018-02-26 19:22:08 UTC <KateDahls> Hello, fellow educators....how long do you give a student who asked for an appointment outside of office hours? He's 6 minutes late already and I've got business elsewhere....but I'm also not a monster.pic.twitter.com/EjM674kYnT
968200071568416768 2018-02-26 19:04:20 UTC <KateDahls> So DJT can zip it and pound sand with these ridiculous claims. Because he's only ever demonstrated a pattern of avoidance. Avoiding Vietnam. Avoiding fidelity. Avoiding education. Avoiding responsibility. He's only met the STANDARD for being an all around Blue Falcon.
968200069337010181 2018-02-26 19:04:19 UTC <KateDahls> In the dark. Under fire. Consumed by smoke and bangs. But even then...I had no idea if I'd ever be able to do it when the stakes were real.  And then it was real.   I...I ran towards danger....  I know this about myself now, but it took that day in April of 2006 to teach me.
968200068099641346 2018-02-26 19:04:19 UTC <KateDahls> I trained for months to prepare for Iraq. Combat training AND combat medical training. I can still hear the NCOs at Fort Sam Houston in my head, "He needs the fluids, Sgt. He's dying without the fluids." And I practiced initiating IVs and putting on tourniquets.
968200065285271552 2018-02-26 19:04:18 UTC <KateDahls> Funny thing about this sort of claim: You actually have to be faced with that reality in order to know how you'd react. It takes SO MUCH TRAINING just to get your muscle memory prepared. Because ultimately it's a flight or fight instinct and the muscle memory only facilitates.pic.twitter.com/dBZwGaP0v5

967134498252050437 2018-02-23 20:30:07 UTC <KateDahls> But don't think for a minute that those of us with experience in gun ranges, combat situations, AND classrooms see this nonsense as a solution. In fact, beware anyone who meets those standards and do see it as a solution. They are part of the problem. #VetsForGunReform
967134496935038978 2018-02-23 20:30:07 UTC <KateDahls> I'm already dealing with the fact that my son of a bitch governor decided that campus carry sounded like a solid plan. (It's not)  So please, give me paper for the printer. Give me dry erase markers. Give me a fucking livable wage.
967134495626399744 2018-02-23 20:30:06 UTC <KateDahls> Because it doesn't belong in the classroom. A classroom is a dedicated space for learning and growing, intellectually and ideologically. Me having a gun in the classroom inhibits that growth.
967134493462224897 2018-02-23 20:30:06 UTC <KateDahls> This guy. We need  gun owners to be more like this guy.  I'm qualified to shoot a 9mm, an M16A2, an M4, and a 50 cal.

966100443272306691 2018-02-20 00:01:09 UTC <KateDahls> The NRA is a terrorist organization. Dismantle it. Destroy it. Bankrupt it. Hold it accountable. Make it irrelevant.
966089198410387456 2018-02-20 23:16:28 UTC <KateDahls> Sometimes you get to read the manuscripts of friends and just enjoy the simple knowledge that you know lovely and brilliant people.
966086903249371141 2018-02-20 23:07:21 UTC <KateDahls> @heyprofbow Spell it out when you talk around them. My last car didn't know it was paid off for 6 months. Then it found out and had to be traded in for a new car payment within weeks.

It's just something I instinctively look for now when looking at collected essays. Where are the women? Where are the persons of color? It determines what I'll buy vs. what I'll check out from library. Thanks for the reply!
966085681943629824 2018-02-20 23:02:30 UTC <KateDahls> But I can see how it destroys. I see how dangerously close it came to destroying me. It's maddening.
966085681142484992 2018-02-20 23:02:30 UTC <KateDahls> Eventually, and with therapy, I came to the conclusion that I am the sum of my experiences and that my "current timeline" would never exist without my exposure to atrocity. I'm lucky because my post-world is somehow an improvement.
966085680215490561 2018-02-20 23:02:29 UTC <KateDahls> For many years, I had a sort of "Sliding Doors" persisting daydream. A side effect of my PTSD, I imagine. I'd go down rabbit holes where I'd try to predict what my life would look like had it continued without atrocity.
966083872357339136 2018-02-20 22:55:18 UTC <KateDahls> A reminder: this is what its like when you are exposed to atrocity. There's your life before it...and your life after it. But the two are decidedly different in tone and projection. And you begin to imagine where that other life might have gone.https://twitter.com/IntrovertRN1975/status/966082274335760384

965662049396252673 2018-02-19 18:59:08 UTC <KateDahls> The most BASIC google image search provides damning evidence. WTAF about any of these human beings is superior? Seriously. They love how fucking inbred they are and gleefully embrace being stupid. I'm flummoxed.pic.twitter.com/o5zwZVhPDI
965660389211066368 2018-02-19 18:52:32 UTC <KateDahls> How does that not automatically get recognized as irrefutable evidence of superiority? I mean....if white folks are so fascinated with superiority, why does their definition of the term suck so much?
965660384471519232 2018-02-19 18:52:31 UTC <KateDahls> My life is better because of all of my friends, my colleagues, my family, and my students. It's inherently superior to any milquetoast group of carnies who willingly put blinders on when faced with uncomfortable truths. It's full of diversity in race, class, gender, religion.
965660381296447488 2018-02-19 18:52:30 UTC <KateDahls> But it also opened me up to new culture, new art, new foods, new language, new poetry, new music, new styles and new people who made my live so....diverse. So beautiful. Enriched.
965660379434151936 2018-02-19 18:52:30 UTC <KateDahls> Anyway, the Army opened me up to what I'd been missing. New frames of reference, new ideologies, new understandings of what privilege looks like and where opportunity to access wealth exists.
965660378473562112 2018-02-19 18:52:29 UTC <KateDahls> Except for a few Indian kids at school because I lived in a university town with a destination engineering program, MBA degree, and Med School. That's an entirely different thread, tho, so we'll save that for later.
965660377597009921 2018-02-19 18:52:29 UTC <KateDahls> I got a LOT of shit from the WoC in my platoon in Basic Training. They could tell I'd never been so close or intimate with folks who weren't white.  I didn't consider myself racist. But I certainly didn't know any people of color.
965660376695234560 2018-02-19 18:52:29 UTC <KateDahls> I think the thing that baffles me the most is the confidence with which white folks embrace a life without diversity. I remember growing up in a segregated town. And then I joined the Army.

965297071279534082 2018-02-18 18:48:50 UTC <KateDahls> The audacity of some *christians* is beyond the pale. I've only got a precious few years to make my life count before I turn into worm-food. It makes no sense to blame anyone for Parkland other than the fucktard who had access to the AR-15 and the politicians who gave it to him.
965296603279122432 2018-02-18 18:46:59 UTC <KateDahls> And when she inevitably gets manhandled and abused, I'll still fight for her stupid ass to have access to healthcare and social welfare.

963555949708496897 2018-02-13 23:30:15 UTC <KateDahls> @FabKail16 No ducking point at all.
963555821253742592 2018-02-13 23:29:44 UTC <KateDahls> So....I don't know....I feel like this lecture is kind of laying all of this out there to make my case, and introduce my main argument for the remainder of the arc this semester. It just feels like I'm writing an important lecture tonight.
963555820343578625 2018-02-13 23:29:44 UTC <KateDahls> I think previous generations had a lock on this information and it is something that needs to be re-learned. Because the veterans who invented the Klan never stopped working. That *other* possible outcome is still very much alive.
963555818351316995 2018-02-13 23:29:43 UTC <KateDahls> But I do think that sometimes it helps to remind folks that standing up and doing something about the issues that concern you is always an option. You can sit and bitch and solve the world's problems from your couch...or you can actually take responsibility for some change.
963555817478934528 2018-02-13 23:29:43 UTC <KateDahls> To my core, I believe in paying it forward. The military is just one part of my life and it's been a life thus far filled with projects that try to make the world a more just and fair place to live. I don't think I'm the only one.
963555815973154818 2018-02-13 23:29:43 UTC <KateDahls> From the War of 1812 forward, American veterans returned from war with an impulse to serve. It might have meant staying in the military. It might have meant government service. It might have meant writing a memoir that sought to answer impossible questions.
963555814597365760 2018-02-13 23:29:42 UTC <KateDahls> To me this demonstrates a historical pattern of two possible postwar lives for combat veterans. You either continue the service of the military as it defines itself, against enemies both foreign and domestic, or you become a domestic enemy.
963555813834088448 2018-02-13 23:29:42 UTC <KateDahls> But veterans also joined the ministry. They fought for Civil Rights. They demanded benefits that recognized their service. They trained.
963555812626063360 2018-02-13 23:29:42 UTC <KateDahls> They rode at night. Took the law into their own hands. Or joined the law and protected white supremacy inside and outside the justice system. They brewed moonshine and lynched black people.
963555811648856064 2018-02-13 23:29:42 UTC <KateDahls> But veterans also moved home and instead of being politicized agents for progressive change, they used the tactics and techniques used in combat and military training to maintain that mantle of white supremacy.
963555810214318080 2018-02-13 23:29:41 UTC <KateDahls> Organizations were formed that shaped the welfare of aged and infirm veterans and their families. Laws enacted by lobbying efforts. Bureaucracy develops. Sanitation improves because of lessons learned. Modernity happens.
963555809446817792 2018-02-13 23:29:41 UTC <KateDahls> And they used this to both great and terrible effect in postwar years. Some, witnessed or served next to soldiers of color and it changed their opinions on access to opportunity.
963555808066916352 2018-02-13 23:29:41 UTC <KateDahls> They know how to organize, how to network, how to shape policy and craft agendas. They know how to cash in their political equity. They know how to shape memory.
963555807118929921 2018-02-13 23:29:41 UTC <KateDahls> And veterans came home with strong opinions. Not just about their time in service, but about what leadership looks like, what defines citizenship, what shape the government ought to take.
963555805860638720 2018-02-13 23:29:40 UTC <KateDahls> The Indian wars that bookend the CW demonstrate the urgency of westward movement and how, if slavery is the answer to the question "What caused the Civil War?" then the answer to "Why was slavery up for scrutiny?" is The West.
963555804870774784 2018-02-13 23:29:40 UTC <KateDahls> The role veterans of the Mexican war in making the American Civil War simply cannot be overstated. It just can't. Soldiers traveling further away from home than ever thought possible saw what was possible in the West.
963555803289522176 2018-02-13 23:29:40 UTC <KateDahls> I'm 7 weeks in to my Spring semester and I might be building one of the most important lectures of my career tonight. We've reached the Mexican-American War in my class and next we be start the long march towards the Civil War.
963502642461921280 2018-02-13 19:58:25 UTC <KateDahls> @erin_bartram Lotsa men with all the answers in that comment thread. Lucky us.pic.twitter.com/e2nAjEtIST
963496332236345344 2018-02-13 19:33:21 UTC <KateDahls> @mjasdixon Since they cleaned up their twitter history, most likely.
963454399031992322 2018-02-13 16:46:43 UTC <KateDahls> Fun fact: The first 25 modern #Olympics games were held exclusively in European countries or the United States.

963179492062658565 2018-02-12 22:34:20 UTC <KateDahls> @UGA_SVRC And that history is just as important, more so in fact. So I hope this lecture is well attended by the veteran community. Thanks again.
963179112616558593 2018-02-12 22:32:50 UTC <KateDahls> @UGA_SVRC We see wars on American soil instigated purely by white supremacy. Veterans who return from battle and use tactics learned to terrorize.
963178806835113985 2018-02-12 22:31:37 UTC <KateDahls> @UGA_SVRC We see AfAm and Native American Rev War soldiers with expectations of agency and that self same freedom that Anglo Americans wrote of...
963178453251043328 2018-02-12 22:30:12 UTC <KateDahls> @UGA_SVRC And that has a history. But there are multiple aspects to approach the history of veterans in the US. So we look at race, too.
963178163542085633 2018-02-12 22:29:03 UTC <KateDahls> @UGA_SVRC They know how to organize, how to network, how to make things happen and work with what youve got. They learn to protect. They grow.
963177877570310144 2018-02-12 22:27:55 UTC <KateDahls> @UGA_SVRC As a lobbying force, veterans have so much political equity. And when politics take over and the government falls short, vets fill in.
963177577631436802 2018-02-12 22:26:44 UTC <KateDahls> @UGA_SVRC In my class on veterans, we talk about the politicizing of return war vets. How service doesnt end when time in service ends.
963177309925765121 2018-02-12 22:25:40 UTC <KateDahls> @UGA_SVRC Its also a moment to recognize your own contribution to the historical narrative. Steer the course and become an active participant.
963177039904804864 2018-02-12 22:24:35 UTC <KateDahls> @UGA_SVRC Teaching vets about previous generations of postwar life gives a sometimes difficult experience some context. U feel less isolated.
963176322829815808 2018-02-12 22:21:44 UTC <KateDahls> Thanks to the @UGA_SVRC for letting #veterans at #UGA know about James Martens upcoming lecture on CW vets.  https://mailchi.mp/5e63784c8826/scholarships-career-fair-grad-school-internships-and-more-2663913?e=89f9af4c38

While he refuses to give ad time (or even ad prices for that matter) to a legitimate group of union organizers, he's happy to run ad time for attorneys who defend the MRA movement.

962062116327837696 2018-02-09 20:34:17 UTC <KateDahls> Fellow white people: the temptation to dress up for #BlackPanther premier is real. Lets keep it respectful and recognize the impact this film has on our PoC friends. A simple BLM T-shirt will suffice. Its not our night.

So nice to hear from all of y'all and I promise I will extend all of your greetings to Ms. Barbara.
961647978099429376 2018-02-08 17:08:39 UTC <KateDahls> @LauraJuneDavis I will relay the message! She came by asking if I were leaving in May, too. Because it looks like after the spring, the only folks that will be around who acknowledge her are me and James Owen. Everyone else is graduating, it seems.
961647697118756865 2018-02-08 17:07:32 UTC <KateDahls> @WelbornTiger I certainly will, Trae!
961631886815776768 2018-02-08 16:04:42 UTC <KateDahls> It has to be a class thing, right? Or race? Or just young kids who came straight through college without ever recognizing what a privilege that is or why ignoring a custodian might be a horrifying signal of that privilege. Either way, it gets me worked up. Do better.
961631886035603458 2018-02-08 16:04:42 UTC <KateDahls> And it would never occur to me that she's not worth saying hello to, or engaging with on a regular, friendly basis. Am I better than her? No fucking way. She knows a days work and so do I. She extends kindness. I appreciate her.
961631884974403584 2018-02-08 16:04:42 UTC <KateDahls> Ms. Barbara is one of the first people I befriended at UGA. She and I suffer the early mornings, the hot summers, the ridiculous staircases. She's been to my house. I invite her to department parties and functions. I attended her husband's funeral.
961631884013965312 2018-02-08 16:04:42 UTC <KateDahls> The lovely, kind, and generous custodian in LeConte Hall came by my office to lament that none of the first year grad students acknowledge her existence. "How do you not say hi to someone you are going to see everyday for years?" How, indeed, Ms. Barbara. I'm sorry to hear this.

960239788430413824 2018-02-04 19:53:00 UTC <KateDahls> If possible, teaching a class I built upon my favorite historical topics has made me even more passionate about them. And anyone who doesn't see the vibrancy and lessons in military social histories isn't paying attention.
960237443113996289 2018-02-04 19:43:41 UTC <KateDahls> Cant teach the Black Hawk War without also teaching Worcester v. Georgia. Because this was a multi-pronged assault against Native Americans that took place throughout the country simultaneously.

959920749019652097 2018-02-03 22:45:15 UTC <KateDahls> Gentle reminder: I'm a combat vet and if you try to start any "veteran bashing" accusations with this, you can GFY. I'm not bashing anyone. I'm pointing out how institutional racism manifests in military structures. There's a flaw in the system.
959920282185162752 2018-02-03 22:43:24 UTC <KateDahls> Think about the southern guard units that stand behind a state flag, the US flag, and a Confederate flag. Think about the hunting culture and the gun culture and the doomsday culture that can gain valuable and transferable skills with 4 years in the service.
959919471690469376 2018-02-03 22:40:11 UTC <KateDahls> This smells so true to me...in ways I can't even articulate. The military does a lot right (UCMJ action against racism, equal pay, socialized healthcare), but it still suffers from segregation in job specialties. And social scenarios. And chow hall tables.

959070278331531264 2018-02-01 14:25:47 UTC <KateDahls> I'm grateful to Knoxville historian, Robert J. Booker, for creating *An Encyclopedia: Experiences of Black People in Knoxville, Tennessee 1844-1974*.
959070277480132608 2018-02-01 14:25:47 UTC <KateDahls> This was a skilled laborer, a young man that's old enough to have a family that depends upon him & a wife that loves him. He has acumen& creates wealth. & in the first years of Knoxville's founding, his labor was exploited.  He's the reason we remember during #BlackHistoryMonth
959070276775497728 2018-02-01 14:25:47 UTC <KateDahls> In May of 1794, a white Knoxvillian was seeking a buyer for one of his slaves. "A likely negro fellow; about twenty-four years of age, healthy and sound who understands all kinds of farming business for terms apply G. Roulstone & Co."
959070276016328704 2018-02-01 14:25:47 UTC <KateDahls> Oliver P. Temple and Andrew Johnson KNEW the only way to preserve slavery was to remain a part of the United States.
959070274388922373 2018-02-01 14:25:46 UTC <KateDahls> There is always such a strong resistance in white East Tennessee to accept participation in the southern economic system. "It's the mountains." "Slavery doesn't work here." "We fought for the Union." As if being pro-Union automatically meant being anti-slavery.
959070273470369792 2018-02-01 14:25:46 UTC <KateDahls> Knoxville was founded in 1791 and within one year it had two local newspapers that included advertisements for slave sales and masters seeking runaways. Slavery was built into the foundation of this city. It's important to recognize this.
959070272757420032 2018-02-01 14:25:46 UTC <KateDahls> It's the beginning of #BlackHistoryMonth and I can think of no better way to celebrate than by sharing the history of my hometown and it's black population. #Knoxville #Tennessee #History
959042988621094917 2018-02-01 12:37:21 UTC <KateDahls> I'm sharing @rhettmc rant on Non-Sports Fans.

958829577614262272 2018-01-31 22:29:20 UTC <KateDahls> @jsargentr No, but should I be? Ill always take recommendations. I am not a historian of the Indian wars and so Im constantly teaching myself while building lectures about them. Its a weak point in my history.
958803692517576705 2018-01-31 20:46:28 UTC <KateDahls> @mckellogs As if she needed more accreditation than her education and degree. "But she's a LADY." "Of course the southern lady ought to write about southern ladies."  I'd eat my shoe if I could find a similar review about a white man. "His experience as a dad prepared him for history." UGH
958803094049054721 2018-01-31 20:44:05 UTC <KateDahls> @mckellogs I felt the same way while studying for comps. Please, look up Bell Wiley's review of *The Southern Lady* by Anne Firor Scott. INFURIATING.   Scott "who is a successful wife, mother, and careerist" is well qualified for her topic. Refers to her as "Mrs. Scott," not Dr., throughout
958771735020625920 2018-01-31 18:39:29 UTC <KateDahls> Which makes the inability for Confederate men to participate emasculating. Women could take advantage of the Homestead Act. It encouraged new starts and manifest destiny. But manifest destiny was also an act of white supremacy. Indians were not a part of America's future.
958771734202716160 2018-01-31 18:39:29 UTC <KateDahls> The Homestead Act is a learned lesson from veteran experience. It is a formal path to extinguishing Native Americans and "solving" the problem. It is a recognition that, as wartime legislation, Lincoln was already thinking about America's landscape post-war.
958770038152024066 2018-01-31 18:32:44 UTC <KateDahls> Writing a lecture for next week on the Black Hawk War. After 15 weeks of military service, a 23 year old Abraham Lincoln received 160 acres of land in Iowa. First hand experience with the western "Indian problem" meant he knew the power of pushing a border with veterans.

958415619619217408 2018-01-30 19:04:24 UTC <KateDahls> And with quite possibly one of the best introductory sentences out there. "Sometimes, white men of the antebellum South pulled or tweaked one another's noses." ?!?!?!
958415617895337984 2018-01-30 19:04:24 UTC <KateDahls> It had been awhile since I first read this, but Kenneth Greenberg's "The Nose, the Lie, and the Duel in the Antebellum South" is an article worth examining during a Trump presidency. American Historical Review, Feb 1990.

956938085509591040 2018-01-26 17:13:13 UTC <KateDahls> @CecilBaldwinIII @theferocity Alright, Cecil sweetie. If you end up speaking to Saeed because of this tweet, Imma expect a shout out from my old friend and a new one because Saeed is my bestie...he just don't know it yet.
956919504243699713 2018-01-26 15:59:23 UTC <KateDahls> Y'all should bring @CecilBaldwinIII on to #AM2DM so he can talk about his gay activism in educating the public about living with HIV. @theferocity @IsaacFitzgerald
956670669915328512 2018-01-25 23:30:36 UTC <KateDahls> Much like Reconstruction's requisite consideration within a secession crisis and civil war lens, the other side has always seemed an artificial separation. The West and the South have long demanded a reckoning.
956670668296335362 2018-01-25 23:30:36 UTC <KateDahls> Holy "Big badass book of Reconstruction," Batman! Richard White's *This Republic for Which it Stands* is some much needed re-centering the geographical and chronological focus of study.
956669255101177862 2018-01-25 23:24:59 UTC <KateDahls> While I think Kelly and Sanders are heckin' precious for their recent expressed interests, I'd like to cordially invite both of them to GTFO of here and let the women talk. Go Away, write a memoir, play with your grandkids, try your hand at baking, knit a fucking sweater. BEGONE
956630796407894020 2018-01-25 20:52:09 UTC <KateDahls> @bdproctor @ccjones13 That's such an amazing moment to witness. When everything clicks into place.
956630080561741824 2018-01-25 20:49:19 UTC <KateDahls> Part of me thinks that the new AnnCurry show on PBS could be renamed "Old People Discover the Internet" but most of me just keeps sobbing and feeling all warm and squishy inside #WellMeetAgain
956619544189128709 2018-01-25 20:07:27 UTC <KateDahls> @AngryBlackLady What are you wearing? Im not doing cosplay, but I feel like this premiere warrants dressing for the occasion.
956366070755086336 2018-01-24 03:20:14 UTC <KateDahls> @Freeyourmindkid She does have a previous life where white mediocre men failed upwards. Its probably a comfortable costume. Remnants of military social norm

956327659100925952 2018-01-24 00:47:36 UTC <KateDahls> @studentactivism Nice start.
956263672690683910 2018-01-24 20:33:20 UTC <KateDahls> There's definitely a recurring theme in this thread. Strong educators, smart women, enlightened perspectives on the dumpster fire that is American politics. So those are my recommendations on this #FollowWomenWednesday
956263386333007873 2018-01-24 20:32:12 UTC <KateDahls> My sister, @TheBeckyTracey just graduated with her MA last year and teaches in the San Diego area. Her pedagogical perspective and righteous hot takes are always worth scrolling through and liking. #FollowWomenWednesday
956262942768619521 2018-01-24 20:30:26 UTC <KateDahls> I've also started following @MiniHistoryProf , my friend Leah who I met here at UGA. She's killing it over at Washington & Lee this year.

956262126120833026 2018-01-24 20:27:12 UTC <KateDahls> Hey all. I want to revive #FollowWomenWednesday today because I've recently followed some pretty incredible women in the last few weeks. Have y'all met @FabKail16 yet? Because more folks should be listening to her takes on the world and academia.
956261535365648384 2018-01-24 20:24:51 UTC <KateDahls> And apparently I'm just old enough and out of touch to refer to them as a dating website and not a dating app.pic.twitter.com/Zquhp5l96b

956247566206820353 2018-01-24 19:29:20 UTC <KateDahls> Larry Nassar deserves every horror handed to him for the rest of his natural born life. And I hope horrors are heaped upon that fucker. Now it looks like it's time to dismantle the University of Michigan and the US Olympic Gymnastics organizations. Burn them all down. Start over.

949704377434099712 2018-01-06 18:09:02 UTC <KateDahls> @mjasdixon Much like the friggin "all lives matter" BS, what irks me about this is OF COURSE NOT ALL MEN ARE RAPE-Y ASSHOLES. But why is the panel happening, Chadwick? Because enough men are that it's a structural problem. So thanks for pointing out the obvious. Now take several seats.

949646789459742721 2018-01-06 14:20:12 UTC <KateDahls> Between these kids and the successful panel on veterans in the classroom yesterday, I'm feeling like I finally know what I'm supposed to do for the rest of my life. Teach. Learn. Research. Advocate.
949646788528627712 2018-01-06 14:20:12 UTC <KateDahls> And I've met a young woman who is a STEM major and she wrote about the history of PTSD. The topic seems near and dear to her heart and her own scientific studies. These kids are passionate. They know the stakes.
949646787706486785 2018-01-06 14:20:12 UTC <KateDahls> I also have a young white Georgian who is, much to his family's chagrin, breaking the perpetuating cycle of CSA worship. He's excited to arm himself with knowledge so he'll be better equipped to educate his backwards-looking Lost Cause fam.
949646786284720128 2018-01-06 14:20:12 UTC <KateDahls> Thus far I've had a young black man express his initial skepticism at the section where they interview the SCV, but then became overjoyed when @edward_l_ayers promptly said, "No, Sir."
949646785382842369 2018-01-06 14:20:11 UTC <KateDahls> I haven't even met my students yet and THEY ARE ALREADY MY FAVORITE PEOPLE. I love smart kids. I love how they can teach me as much as I hope to teach them. They bring their own backstory and background into their work.
949646784485298179 2018-01-06 14:20:11 UTC <KateDahls> Y'all. My first class meeting fell victim to me being here in DC for the #AHA18 so I assigned them an older @BackStoryRadio podcast on veterans and asked for a 500 word response to at least two of the segments.

949424351576813568 2018-01-05 23:36:19 UTC <KateDahls> Thanks for the synopsis and the good review! This was a solid panel and I loved the questions posed. I think we all walked away better for this panel.https://twitter.com/awmerck/status/949418812385972224
949417250066444288 2018-01-05 23:08:06 UTC <KateDahls> @profevanbennett You are very sweet.  It was this morning. 
949356835827585025 2018-01-05 19:08:02 UTC <KateDahls> @KevinIsHistory The very model of an excellent gatekeeper, Im sure. 
949356578096009216 2018-01-05 19:07:01 UTC <KateDahls> @pollyp1 Way to punch down and discourage honest expressions of curiosity. Makes you a worthy gatekeeper, for sure. *eyes roll ALL THE WAY BACK UNTIL I SEE MY BRAIN*
949326627594559493 2018-01-05 17:08:00 UTC <KateDahls> @EmilySenefeld Im approaching it like some sort of salacious rag, full of detail w/ little new revelation. I mostly want to read it bc I know it is pissing DJT OFF to no end.
949255352041734144 2018-01-05 12:24:46 UTC <KateDahls> @EmilySenefeld You've inspired me. As did Wolff's interview this morning with Savannah Guthrie. I did it, too. 
949254148968546305 2018-01-05 12:20:00 UTC <KateDahls> Wolff on NBC Today is NOT HOLDING BACK. And it's delicious. Imma have to buy this damn book.

949082723683008512 2018-01-04 00:58:49 UTC <KateDahls> Thank you to everyone who participated. You'll be with me in spirit tomorrow.pic.twitter.com/ysmlYDLFmG
949082722458394627 2018-01-04 00:58:48 UTC <KateDahls> But all have recognized the value in their collective voices being heard. Once I get some notes from my co-panelists, I'm turning this project into an article and will seek publication. And it will be a win for all of us, I promise.
949082721451724800 2018-01-04 00:58:48 UTC <KateDahls> Their stories are riveting, their experiences unique.  They deserve to be heard, every single one.  Some have asked for anonymity. They will get it.
949082720449200128 2018-01-04 00:58:48 UTC <KateDahls> I've interviewed black women, white women, Latina women, hispanic women. Gay and straight. With PTSD and without. Combat veterans and peacetime service members.
949082719463624705 2018-01-04 00:58:48 UTC <KateDahls> I've talked to older women who served in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. I've engaged veterans my own age who served during and after 9/11. I've interviewed young women who astonish me with their bravery and heartache.
949082718540791814 2018-01-04 00:58:47 UTC <KateDahls> I've also been interviewing UGA veterans for an oral history project and every woman I've spoken with has shared some thoughts that have contributed to this event, too.
949082717051871233 2018-01-04 00:58:47 UTC <KateDahls> Over the last year, I've been soliciting lady historians who've raised their right hand in the past. They answered a questionnaire I created with this roundtable in mind.
949082716192067585 2018-01-04 00:58:47 UTC <KateDahls> Tomorrow, I'll join some other veterans-turned-historians for the #AHA18 roundtable on veterans in the history classroom. (that's item no. 77 for folks who are looking for an 8:30am panel to attend) I'm walking in with the voices of many women vets.

948741701509693440 2018-01-03 02:23:43 UTC <KateDahls> @TheMedievalDrK @mckellogs @journeymanhisto That is not evidence of sap, just pure badassery.
948740793216524288 2018-01-03 02:20:06 UTC <KateDahls> But these are two instances that demonstrate a preference for Lost Cause history informing a sci-fi future where racism is supposedly obsolete? I feel like Whedon let us down with this shit. The rebels losing was a good thing. *fin*
948740274792095744 2018-01-03 02:18:02 UTC <KateDahls> And don't forget he gave Jubal Early a role in the series, too.  @NathanFillion is a great great nephew if I'm getting it right. I'd love to get my hands on any family papers he might have access to or know of...
948739703871868929 2018-01-03 02:15:46 UTC <KateDahls> Sort of demonstrates the success of the Lost Cause. We Firefly fans love the brown coats. The rebels who fought the good fight and lost to a heartless Union. Damn it, Whedon.https://twitter.com/scififacts/status/948735744922804224

946046791761448960 2017-12-27 15:55:06 UTC <KateDahls> @profevanbennett But admitting prejudicial anger exists is problematic to color blind hacks like JCO. Spontaneous rage harder to solve, easier to assign, and leaves difficult conversations unsaid.

941800049272647681 2017-12-15 22:40:04 UTC <KateDahls> High point of 2017.   For reals.  This tweet. Best moment of 2017.https://twitter.com/BetteMidler/status/941799506013716480
941798385467707392 2017-12-15 22:33:27 UTC <KateDahls> Mike heard me.  I think.  I hope.  I want the blanket to get here. I'd like it to make me feel better.  But more than that, I want companies that sell "solutions" to try and not be part of the problem.
941798384477921280 2017-12-15 22:33:27 UTC <KateDahls> So they need to own the fact that they ghosted a customer base already prone to skepticism and anxiousness. That's not a good business practice. In fact, when described, they sound predatory.
941798383714557952 2017-12-15 22:33:27 UTC <KateDahls> The people who are willing to spend hundreds of dollars on something that feels like a hug are likely doing it to treat a symptom. @gravityblankets acknowledges this point and their website provides links to scientific journals for treating anxiety.
941798382766608385 2017-12-15 22:33:26 UTC <KateDahls> So I told him, whether he acknowledges it or not, or is qualified or not, his company sells his product as a solution for a problem they are not equipped to address. In turn, customers will meet a general demographic.
941797131911860224 2017-12-15 22:28:28 UTC <KateDahls> @gravityblankets So Mike called. And I voiced my concerns. At first he kept trying to give me a pinpointed package ETA. I told him that I don't even care at this point, but that he needed to listen to my issues with his company.
941776448049819649 2017-12-15 21:06:17 UTC <KateDahls> This is so stupid. I cant believe how much of my time theyve wasted with their ineptitude.https://twitter.com/katedahls/status/941775650402250752

You are a poor purveyor of snake oil. You want our money but don't want to answer for it. You offer polite responses with literally no substantive answers. You are a con.

You can't be held accountable. What's your street addresss? Phone number? How is anyone able to call you on your snake oil?

I was the first in my group to purchase this supposed blanket. Friends wanted my review before they purchased their own. What do you think I say now?

That's not a good sign. Doesn't predict success in the long run.
941749859912159233 2017-12-15 19:20:38 UTC <KateDahls> @kickstarter @JLHoover123 @MollyCain @johnnyfio @gravityblankets Give me a phone number to call. How do your customers talk to anyone? How are y'all so dysfunctional?

941673624800583681 2017-12-15 14:17:42 UTC <KateDahls> @johnnyfio What's a good phone number for your customers to speak directly to someone about the status of their purchase? FB messenger isn't enough.

940603701777129473 2017-12-12 15:26:12 UTC <KateDahls> So when I see DJT use scare quotes to imply indecent acts of a professional government official....well I see right through his disgusting charges. This is a sign of pettiness. Entitlement. Unjustified swagger. And  willful ignorance.
940603145796845569 2017-12-12 15:24:00 UTC <KateDahls> The last time I saw her, she pulled me outside to yell at me and insinuate something that never happened. She really couldn't see that her attitude, and entitlement, might have had something to do with folks not wanting to work with her.
940602871179071488 2017-12-12 15:22:54 UTC <KateDahls> She held a grudge because she wanted him to chair her thesis, too, and he didn't take the gig. Therefore I *must* have done something to garner his attention. Oddly enough, I got his attention as someone with skill. Guess she had none.
940602510624149504 2017-12-12 15:21:28 UTC <KateDahls> In my MA program, one of my colleagues, an older woman who demanded unwarranted praise on her work, accused me of being "willing to do anything" for my thesis advisor. Her veiled accusation literally scared the shit out of me. And it was a lie.

939876929506816001 2017-12-10 15:18:16 UTC <KateDahls> I think one of the more difficult lessons to learn in academia is that there will NEVER be a good time to take a break & enjoy anything else, but you must do it anyway.

938569788288356357 2017-12-06 00:44:09 UTC <KateDahls> @amywatts @mckellogs Right? Cats can be such bitches. Amazing, crafty, shameless bitches.
938568874609569792 2017-12-06 00:40:32 UTC <KateDahls> @mckellogs My friend @amywatts found out her cat was living a secret, second, life.http://www.kshb.com/lifestyle/pets/kitty-cams-show-the-secret-life-of-cats
938568426628534272 2017-12-06 00:38:45 UTC <KateDahls> And I'm pinning this tweet to my profile because RAWR.https://twitter.com/KateDahls/status/938567675667722241
938567900235030528 2017-12-06 00:36:39 UTC <KateDahls> But yes, I do love some cadence.pic.twitter.com/yfLDRZi86t
938567675667722241 2017-12-06 00:35:46 UTC <KateDahls> Never underestimate the power of motivated veterans to change the rules of government. We've been doing it since 1789.
938567349191442432 2017-12-06 00:34:28 UTC <KateDahls> It's heartening to see most veterans I meet trying to make the world a better place and a place worth having served. I take the insult of a DJT presidency personally. I didn't go to war for this shit.
938567026527924224 2017-12-06 00:33:11 UTC <KateDahls> They work as nurses and lend their expertise in shaping medical protocols that consider a veteran's medical needs. They become attorneys to serve the latino communities they met and befriended during military service. New experiences shape ideologies.
938566537505660928 2017-12-06 00:31:14 UTC <KateDahls> But finding other vets in my area is always an amazing experience. The oral histories I've started collecting on campus have yielded some surprising trends. You shouldn't be surprised that many vets continue serving, in some capacity, as a civilian.
938566046646243331 2017-12-06 00:29:17 UTC <KateDahls> I guess the messed up part is, when you have PTSD you hyper-focus on the shitty seconds that took place among thousands of hours of camaraderie, friendship, and laughter. A 15 year war exhausts a nation. My year in Iraq dominates 10 years of service.
938565480125693952 2017-12-06 00:27:02 UTC <KateDahls> Running cadence were fun, but I loved the drama of more serious marching cadence. Stuff you bring out for a military parade. The tear-jerkers that talk about MLK. That shit was powerful.
938565241633411072 2017-12-06 00:26:05 UTC <KateDahls> I hear some cadence from Basic Training and suddenly it is 1997 and I am in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and it is raining in the dark and I am running.
938564999504646144 2017-12-06 00:25:08 UTC <KateDahls> Y'all I heard an Army Reserve commercial in the other room and the cadence calling got me out of my seat and dancing. I. Loved. Cadence. Loved learning new ones, loved leading them, loved collecting them.
938559241786454017 2017-12-06 00:02:15 UTC <KateDahls> Hey #twitterstorians at what point do you just delete the paragraph?

938384786011381760 2017-12-06 12:29:01 UTC <KateDahls> Fuck you, Mike. John Oliver is what this toxic culture needs. Your backstage scenario got us decades of coverups. What are you afraid of? Sunlight disinfects.https://twitter.com/michaelrapaport/status/938292629216940033

938226034381611010 2017-12-05 01:58:12 UTC <KateDahls> @heyprofbow As a vet, Ill say I joined for the GI Bill, service to country was lower on the list. Also, service is service no matter your uniform. Im just as fulfilled doing volunteer work as I was in the Army. Basic civics, that is.

938220316165378048 2017-12-05 01:35:29 UTC <KateDahls> So the threats of no more hugs sound more like a wishful hope on my part. Please. Shake my hand. Let me shake yours. Ive been practicing for years. Im quite good at it. And I can judge you by how you handle it. Quid pro quo.
938219802660925440 2017-12-05 01:33:26 UTC <KateDahls> Ive found shaking a mans hand is a useful tool for gauging their personality. When Im hugged instead, I am being cut out of what is apparently a well known practice.
938219235008045056 2017-12-05 01:31:11 UTC <KateDahls> Its an interesting way to judge another person. Clearly I internalized my lesson. But by instinctively going for the hug with women, men dont even let women play the handshake size-up.
938218539894394880 2017-12-05 01:28:25 UTC <KateDahls> Look at our fearless and feckless leader and his shit handshake power play.pic.twitter.com/R5VyFnNEOK
938218179754692608 2017-12-05 01:26:59 UTC <KateDahls> Some men, though, take the handshake as an opportunity to exert themselves.  Like, actively trying to crush the bones in my hand levels of exertion.
938217772785569792 2017-12-05 01:25:22 UTC <KateDahls> Heres what Ive learned in the subsequent 33 years: my handshake was absolutely judged.  But I learned more about men by how they reacted. Most, I could tell, respect my handshake.
938217260006723585 2017-12-05 01:23:20 UTC <KateDahls> Its the first impression. And it conveys something about your capabilities. So I practice. And as years go by, I learn to judge others by this hyper-masculine standard.
938216729725071360 2017-12-05 01:21:14 UTC <KateDahls> And then he immediately corrects me.  We practice.  Firm grip. Solid shake. Last to let go.  Its a power play, Katie. No one will take you seriously with a limp hand.
938216296751263744 2017-12-05 01:19:31 UTC <KateDahls> See, sis and I were playing on the porch. Kent comes outside and plays along.  How do you do? And sticks out his hand.  Me, being 6, offers him the equivalent of a dead fish hand.  Limp.
938215773679575040 2017-12-05 01:17:26 UTC <KateDahls> When my sister and I were in kindergarten, my mom was dating a guy. We will call him Kent. Kent taught me about handshakes. When I was 6.
938215429943824389 2017-12-05 01:16:04 UTC <KateDahls> All these dudes freaking out because they can no longer hug. But can we talk about handshakes for a minute?
938187880631070720 2017-12-05 23:26:36 UTC <KateDahls> @FatMike_of_NOFX @mckellogs What Spotify doesnt account for is the music I bought on iTunes this year. Kendrick Lamars DAMN would give NOFX a run for the #1 slot.
938187011944534016 2017-12-05 23:23:08 UTC <KateDahls> @mckellogs Im certain you are correct. Im out of fucks to give, though, and that last track listed is AMAZING driving music.
938185144241999873 2017-12-05 23:15:43 UTC <KateDahls> Thanks @mckellogs for alerting me to this Spotify #Wrapped info.  True story: hadnt listened to punk in almost 15 years. Then 2017 happened and I got angry again.  Thanks for the sanity @FatMike_of_NOFXpic.twitter.com/2vrK69T72P

938083378720575490 2017-12-05 16:31:20 UTC <KateDahls> I'll destroy both Statler and Waldorf.  I'd go down in a blaze of glory, happy to have been destroyed by ANIMAL.https://twitter.com/kibblesmith/status/938044678800314368

938081568521846784 2017-12-05 16:24:09 UTC <KateDahls> @LDBurnett Thank you for not taking offense to this suggestion. I debated on whether I should tweet it, but I am trying to make myself a more empathetic educator. Giving students the benefit of the doubt seems the best way to begin.
938080376299417601 2017-12-05 16:19:25 UTC <KateDahls> @KevinIsHistory That's a lovely analogy and I might just steal it from you. I was thinking about spending a few minutes talking about what it was like to be active duty Army that day.  It was such a long and terrifying day.
938080082878492676 2017-12-05 16:18:15 UTC <KateDahls> @ProfDaveAndress Funny you should mention The Doors. That morning driving to work, I was listening to "Bird of Prey." The last 16 years I've listened to NPR instead.  Bird of prey Bird of prey Flying high
938079778514653186 2017-12-05 16:17:02 UTC <KateDahls> The primary sources they are to have read for today are wanting. Nothing that recreates what it was like for so many in those minutes and hours where Americans panicked to find each other and answers.
938079158294507521 2017-12-05 16:14:34 UTC <KateDahls> Prepping to walk into my last discussion section of semester. They are turning in papers and the topic for today is 9/11 and GWOT. I'm at a loss as to how to end a course on this particular note.
938078710686715904 2017-12-05 16:12:47 UTC <KateDahls> @LDBurnett Wouldnt it serve both of you if you simply made her aware of her disruptive volume? Surely theres a more suitable place for her to hold court. If she knew she was getting strung up on Twitter, how do you think shed feel?
938056604578123776 2017-12-05 14:44:57 UTC <KateDahls> @AdrianCJax Self care and self love. No need to apologize to any of us. We got you.

937496072339025920 2017-12-03 01:37:36 UTC <KateDahls> Fuck it. I am.  Ran into danger and put a kid on my bird in a hot combat zone.

937491186868195330 2017-12-03 01:18:11 UTC <KateDahls> Pheroba Hale. Her husband served as a Union spy and she protected her home and family in a confederate state. On the 4th of July, the year TN seceded, she and her daughters raised the American Flag and sang the National Anthem.

She fought for union, escaping capture at Vicksburg.  In her 80s, the Soldiers Home discovered her sex and forced her into a dress.

936619877619597312 2017-12-01 15:35:55 UTC <KateDahls> Today is #WorldAIDSDay & when my oldest and dearest friend, @CecilBaldwinIII first told me he was positive, I despaired, not recognizing how strong he is and how much his story would help others. No despair needed. You're my hero, sweetie.

936337953827278848 2017-11-30 20:55:39 UTC <KateDahls> Extended office hours all week to give advice on paper writing.  At same time, editing essay for book. Taking my own advice is super helpful.  Who'd've thought?  Teaching is a gift on many levels.
936334891251363840 2017-11-30 20:43:28 UTC <KateDahls> @KevinMKruse When I was nearing completion on my thesis, my MA advisor warned me, "Kate, no one will throw you a parade. No jazz bands will serenade you."  But then he snuck behind my back and brought in a jazz band to serenade my thesis defense. Because he's amazing.

936248676082597888 2017-11-30 15:00:53 UTC <KateDahls> @CaroleEmberton I like this very much. Sending to students in 3....2....
936244907173347328 2017-11-30 14:45:55 UTC <KateDahls> And to be clear, I don't think less of the students who do this. I automatically assume it's because they are not aware it's an issue. But many write emails like their texting a buddy.

936244510715273216 2017-11-30 14:44:20 UTC <KateDahls> I've had my military service questioned, my sexual orientation doubted, and my education challenged. And then, yes, always with the "ugly fat bitch."  Always.https://twitter.com/_wangwe/status/936154220734177280
936244033822838786 2017-11-30 14:42:26 UTC <KateDahls> *don't warn them. Doesn't.  I'm such a goober.
936240911629111297 2017-11-30 14:30:02 UTC <KateDahls> Do you teach your students how to send an email in college? I didn't think it was my responsibility, but here we are. I fear that if I, a lowly grad student, doesn't warn them, then some professor will hand them their ass later.
936234818194550784 2017-11-30 14:05:49 UTC <KateDahls> Hey Matt Lauer: for the record mischaracterized charges is the fancy way of saying she wanted it.  Creep.

936028675576868864 2017-11-29 00:26:41 UTC <KateDahls> @TimLombard0 Yeah, this came to mind early. Also a great example of low tech, poor production of music videos. The infancy of it.
936028280481832960 2017-11-29 00:25:07 UTC <KateDahls> @F20tgrshark The visuals in this video make it a strong contender. I think most 1980 children grew up WATCHING their music as much as listening to it. Music as visual exploration.

If you teach a survey lecture on the 1980s and never once mention the AIDS/HIV epidemic and the panic it created, you are doing it wrong. Say Ryan White's name.

933003186243239941 2017-11-21 16:04:28 UTC <KateDahls> Sadly, I was turned off from gender studies as a reaction to this. Slowly creeping back into it. Masculinity makes it necessary. Still mad.

931971484070891520 2017-11-18 19:44:51 UTC <KateDahls> @rauchway In fact, I'd wager that tweets will stand as significant evidence for future histories of DJT's presidency. Every time something new comes out about the campaign, you can go back and see that he can't keep his mouth shut.

931928676555542528 2017-11-18 16:54:45 UTC <KateDahls> @zellieimani @actualus civil disobedience does not appeal to the morality of the oppressor, it appeals to the morality of the witness, as you've just demonstrated.
931919642670653441 2017-11-18 16:18:51 UTC <KateDahls> @zellieimani @actualus Where does her statement encourage violence? Shes pointing out the same thing you are. Folks dont get rights by asking nicely.

931899834637971458 2017-11-18 15:00:09 UTC <KateDahls> @zellieimani @actualus Right. Not an appeal to oppressors, but a continuous rejection of oppression through peaceful means.

931610731933585408 2017-11-17 19:51:21 UTC <KateDahls> Giving Franken the benefit of the doubt because we only have 1 photograph does not make his actions excusable. Nor does the victim's forgiveness. It's really that simple.
931610348947496968 2017-11-17 19:49:50 UTC <KateDahls> If nothing else, the women coming forward about their abuse and harassment is teaching me just how ignorant most men are about what is acceptable and what is not. Folks I thought were on my side, even. Sheesh.

921397107180916737 2017-10-20 15:26:03 UTC <KateDahls> Don't let a veteran intimidate you into silence. Don't place a veteran on an altar to worship. Don't color us all with the same brush.
921396868902543360 2017-10-20 15:25:06 UTC <KateDahls> Trust me, they get shit on by the normal soldiers/sailors/marines/airmen/coasties. Big tough guys with too much testosterone. Panties in wad
921396502852927488 2017-10-20 15:23:39 UTC <KateDahls> Traumatic events no longer just take place on battlefields. So self-righteous veterans are generally just assholes with something to prove.
921396259763736577 2017-10-20 15:22:41 UTC <KateDahls> Military service is just one of the many ways folks can serve their country. It's basic civics. Camaraderie grows in all communities.
921395993777790984 2017-10-20 15:21:38 UTC <KateDahls> You're damn skippy it does. Informs questions I ask. But does that mean that other smart people are incapable of engaging war w/o service.
921395709273952257 2017-10-20 15:20:30 UTC <KateDahls> And I say this as both a combat veteran and a PhD student who studies the veteran throughout history. Does my service influence my study?
921395524917448705 2017-10-20 15:19:46 UTC <KateDahls> Hey America, veterans don't own the narrative on war. Or service. So if assbags ask for your DD214 before you offer an opinion, use mine.
921394905439711233 2017-10-20 15:17:18 UTC <KateDahls> @jsargentr @dansukman Hi Jill. You can use my DD214. No worries. And fuck these vets who forgot what they vowed when they raised their right hands.
921394217800421376 2017-10-20 15:14:34 UTC <KateDahls> Mike Simpson, like every other vet, served all Americans. Not just Republicans. If he doesn't like it, he can pound sand and join the KKK.https://twitter.com/DrMikeSimpson/status/921185503734652928

920665036623933443 2017-10-18 14:57:04 UTC <KateDahls> She sat down on the couch and listened to their horrible news. And then she told them, "you are going to have to wake my boys up....
920664863680159744 2017-10-18 14:56:23 UTC <KateDahls> Her husband, Joshua, was a Kiowa pilot. He was shot down. They knocked on her door early in the morning. Kids asleep. She invited them in.
920664652400545792 2017-10-18 14:55:32 UTC <KateDahls> I had been there on her wedding day. We had been barracks roommates. I held her hand when she gave birth to the twins.

919574449481019392 2017-10-15 14:43:28 UTC <KateDahls> How I know Hollywood won't ever change: Mel Gibson's in a Christmas movie this year and folks still give Woody Allen the time of day.

919331470887530496 2017-10-14 22:37:57 UTC <KateDahls> @cmclymer We could certainly make some more room for women and PoC. Get rid of the pigs, and the humans will act like humans.

919329855501754369 2017-10-14 22:31:32 UTC <KateDahls> @jh_roberts OHMYGOD. Are you one of the South East Women Wrestlers?!?!?!?!?
919286926611447808 2017-10-14 19:40:57 UTC <KateDahls> @cjdenial @mckellogs When I learned the author went full blown eugenics propagandist, this story got even freakier.
919281043949187073 2017-10-14 19:17:34 UTC <KateDahls> Before I get the "not all men," lecture. Don't. I know this. Everyone knows this. I'm saying ALL WOMEN HAVE STORIES.
919271673253318657 2017-10-14 18:40:20 UTC <KateDahls> I can't imagine what is said when the last female leaves the room.
919271528646234112 2017-10-14 18:39:46 UTC <KateDahls> is not a descriptor, it's an insult. And this is the stuff they'll say in front of women in uniform. Bc we keep their secrets. Hooah.
919271249452371969 2017-10-14 18:38:39 UTC <KateDahls> And wives of soldiers/sailors/airmen/coasties...don't get me started on the way you are demeaned in your absence. The title "dependent"
919268611000291328 2017-10-14 18:28:10 UTC <KateDahls> What's fucked up: I recall this event clearly, but it doesn't even register as something I'd normally mention. BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE STORIES.
919268350668300289 2017-10-14 18:27:08 UTC <KateDahls> And this is a story of when NOTHING happened. It's just a thing. I'm in a combat zone and it's not the Iraqi who did this. It's my guys.
919268094312439809 2017-10-14 18:26:07 UTC <KateDahls> Command wanted to keep it quiet. No charges were pressed. I asked for a restraining order. They counseled him. But I got to lock the door.
919267847527976962 2017-10-14 18:25:08 UTC <KateDahls> My dear friend, Kelly, is walking down the hall. He leaves. I collapse in tears, shaking, sobbing. He didn't think anything was wrong.
919267628216184832 2017-10-14 18:24:16 UTC <KateDahls> Eventually, I get to the door, ask him to walk out with me, and then as soon as he leaves the Aid Station, miracle of miracle,
919267423760670720 2017-10-14 18:23:27 UTC <KateDahls> I stand up and start lacing up my boots. I'm fully dressed bc I'm at work. As I'm tying my boots I just kept talking to him. Calmly.
919267241954291718 2017-10-14 18:22:44 UTC <KateDahls> He grabs me by the shoulders and shakes me. Why don't I love him like he loves me?  What. The. Fuck.
919267060823347202 2017-10-14 18:22:01 UTC <KateDahls> Then imagine my surprise when I wake up in the Aid Station at 3am to him standing over me? STANDING OVER ME. I've never woke up that fast.
919266811308371968 2017-10-14 18:21:01 UTC <KateDahls> So I told him. Sorry. I'm too f'd up in the head right now. Need to be alone. And we all lived happily ever after.
919266612267700225 2017-10-14 18:20:14 UTC <KateDahls> I could tell he probably liked me. Did I mention I was divorcing someone? Yeah, I did not need anything like a date/boyfriend/whatever. NO.
919266373146161153 2017-10-14 18:19:17 UTC <KateDahls> He started hanging out at the Aid Station. Asking for BP checks. Asked if I wanted to go to the gym sometime. Innocent stuff.
919266134788067328 2017-10-14 18:18:20 UTC <KateDahls> There was a guy in my BN. In another company. I knew everyone. I had to take care of them. He found out I was going through a divorce.
919265896253870080 2017-10-14 18:17:23 UTC <KateDahls> I always felt safe. There was always a pilot or someone from the S3 office nearby. Someone is always awake. So I slept.
919265732512440320 2017-10-14 18:16:44 UTC <KateDahls> But the rule also had a caveat. Leave the door to the aid station open in case of a medical emergency. No worries. I'm next to the ToC.
919265532683177985 2017-10-14 18:15:56 UTC <KateDahls> The medics and doc had an understanding: if you are tired, and there is no work to be done, sleep on an examining table.
919265366345478145 2017-10-14 18:15:17 UTC <KateDahls> Still, it didn't always work. Al Asad Airbase, Iraq, 2006. I'm pulling 24 hour duty at the BN aid station.
919265158396088320 2017-10-14 18:14:27 UTC <KateDahls> I always tried to crowbar myself into a fourth category, the funny girl. If I can make them laugh, I'll be safe.
919265000748933120 2017-10-14 18:13:49 UTC <KateDahls> And MY GOD what I saw in the military. Women in the army are 1 of 3 things: bitches, dykes, or sluts.  That's it.
919264761640095744 2017-10-14 18:12:52 UTC <KateDahls> When a predator finds a moment alone, it doesn't matter what victim he's with, it's about power.
919264608250146817 2017-10-14 18:12:16 UTC <KateDahls> And I have NEVER been the cutest person at work. It doesn't matter. This isn't flirting. This is an opportunity.
919264348488585217 2017-10-14 18:11:14 UTC <KateDahls> I've been sexually harassed at three of my previous jobs. None since I entered academia, but that just means I'm lucky. It's EVERYWHERE.

918152624003866626 2017-10-11 16:33:38 UTC <KateDahls> "But our president said they were all okay."  And that's how the folks in PR are going to starve. Bc folks believe his lies.

916326380446605312 2017-10-06 15:36:48 UTC <KateDahls> Many oral histories have made me laugh, take pause, or tear up. My brave colleague made me weep. Sending care packages to her fam in PR.
916326045195923456 2017-10-06 15:35:28 UTC <KateDahls> Q: What do you want future historians to know?  A: PR never wanted Imperialism. Still we served in incredible numbers. Trump is a monster.
916325715649449984 2017-10-06 15:34:09 UTC <KateDahls> Another Oral History in the books.  I interviewed a colleague. She's a Cold War vet from Puerto Rico. Current events & history merged.

915669789183488000 2017-10-04 20:07:44 UTC <KateDahls> @journeymanhisto It's become clear that to succeed in this field, we gotta hustle up an audience. I'm just over here hustling to create demand. Lol.
915668892839706624 2017-10-04 20:04:11 UTC <KateDahls> @journeymanhisto Yup. I figure if I can teach them to think about veterans before the become one, maybe that can change how they approach leadership.

914663875198537729 2017-10-01 01:30:36 UTC <KateDahls> I also detailed my love for the Arts and Humanities Act. The words "mushiest of squishy warm and lovely legislations" might be tucked in.
914663193078878209 2017-10-01 01:27:53 UTC <KateDahls> I dunno. I just think folks need to see the connections. That we didn't just arrive here. That Reconstruction never ended.
914662832351989760 2017-10-01 01:26:27 UTC <KateDahls> CRA, VRA, Immigration and Nationality Act. Let's discuss conservative white supremacists in the South and their affinity for LBJ's Democrat.
914662406269411328 2017-10-01 01:24:45 UTC <KateDahls> I fail as an educator if they can leave my classroom believing that hateful GOP lie, "Y'all are the party of the Klan." LET. ME. BE. CLEAR..
914662078136414208 2017-10-01 01:23:27 UTC <KateDahls> And the Party flip. I wasn't going to explicitly break it down, but we've got new rules, y'all. I detailed the Southern flip to GOP.
914661853745250304 2017-10-01 01:22:34 UTC <KateDahls> My Great Society Lecture is pretty much half New Deal liberalism and half addressing the shortcomings of Reconstruction amendments.
914661566255177728 2017-10-01 01:21:25 UTC <KateDahls> I care a LOT about how the 14th and 15th Amendment worked in the 20th century. That's what I learned today. It all came down to those two.
914658545706180608 2017-10-01 01:09:25 UTC <KateDahls> Writing lectures might be one of my favorite things. It forces me to clarify my own position. Make it easily digestible.

914548863985442816 2017-10-01 17:53:35 UTC <KateDahls> @traecrowder @aviarian And I'm saying that opinion reeks of white privilege. For whom is it better?  I'm not responsible for your blindness to that.
914535068789551104 2017-10-01 16:58:46 UTC <KateDahls> @traecrowder @aviarian You were literally implying that the South used to be better than it is today. Better for whom? Go avoid uncomfortable conversations.

912136238496395264 2017-09-24 02:06:40 UTC <KateDahls> So #StarTrekDiscovery is AH-mazing. Strong women. Intelligent debate. Between it & #Orville a new era of Roddenberry's consciousness dawns.

911959801546121217 2017-09-24 14:25:34 UTC <KateDahls> I'm a  #vetsforkaepernick bc I served the people, not a flag. I defended an idea, not a magic rag. Don't use my service to defend ur hate.
911759437752176640 2017-09-23 01:09:24 UTC <KateDahls> @SamuelLJackson @shna23 I served. I lost friends. They didn't die for a flag, they died protecting the right to protest. You insult vets to say we fight for cloth.

904800007009837061 2017-09-04 20:15:06 UTC <KateDahls> The security guard for the cannabis shop is a veteran who has #PTSD and that's what made me love the show. For a comedy about pot, it is
904799772858609664 2017-09-04 20:14:10 UTC <KateDahls> There's a canned laugh track that seems to have pissed some folks off, which I totally get. Round about the 3rd episode, however, it blooms.

903406334485438464 2017-08-31 23:57:09 UTC <KateDahls> I don't dismiss @IronStache or @SenDuckworth . I know they are capable of govt. service bc they have a demonstrated history of it.

903343636179546112 2017-08-31 19:48:00 UTC <KateDahls> I've resented the VA for how they  fuck up so many follow-ups for struggling veterans. But I'm happy to know they take care of these guys.
903343356952096772 2017-08-31 19:46:54 UTC <KateDahls> These guys get a very different out processing format. They and the EOD (bomb squad) have a more structured and vigilant "decompression" exp
903343095063990272 2017-08-31 19:45:51 UTC <KateDahls> A child who entered a situation where his whole mission in life was to get the fallen out of a war zone in less than 24 hours. With honor.
903342874200330240 2017-08-31 19:44:59 UTC <KateDahls> The amount of reverence he had for the men and women he helped send home totally changed his outlook on life. He joined at 17! A child.
903342663457542145 2017-08-31 19:44:08 UTC <KateDahls> So he spent a year of his life talking to 13 other guys. Sleeping, eating, working, killing time, telling stories, and training.
903342436776378368 2017-08-31 19:43:14 UTC <KateDahls> And when off duty hours pop up and time exists for socializing....no one wants to hang with the creepy dudes who work in the morgue.
903342272288354305 2017-08-31 19:42:35 UTC <KateDahls> Then he reminded me of what he was trained to do. He gets the Fallen back home. He prepares the remains and files the paperwork.
903342043015110656 2017-08-31 19:41:40 UTC <KateDahls> The second interview, the Marine. He talked about his deployment. 14 men in Kandahar. Only talked amongst themselves. At 1st, I was confusedhttps://twitter.com/KateDahls/status/903336919072993283
903341129487306755 2017-08-31 19:38:03 UTC <KateDahls> @LeandraNessel It was so unexpected. And we'd had this really nice long conversation. Then, I ask this and he immediately breaks. It broke my heart.
903340790084231174 2017-08-31 19:36:42 UTC <KateDahls> This seems 100 different kinds of wrong to me. I'm surprised the military dropped the ball like that. For most stuff, sure, but this?

903340291406618624 2017-08-31 19:34:43 UTC <KateDahls> He didn't find out about Niko's untimely demise until SEVEN MORE MONTHS had passed. There is no procedure for follow up. And dude WANTED him
903340059449024514 2017-08-31 19:33:48 UTC <KateDahls> Died the first day out. You know who knew Niko's fence climbing skillset? The man I interviewed who worked with him for 6 years.

903339197536329729 2017-08-31 19:30:22 UTC <KateDahls> Did you know that Dog Handlers are not notified when their former partner comes up for adoption? Or when the dog passes away? Shameful.https://twitter.com/KateDahls/status/903336919072993283

897570859858186246 2017-08-15 21:29:03 UTC <KateDahls> @divafancypants What's more disappointing is hearing they aren't fighting for you. The power of having a committee that goes to bat can't be overstated. Ugh
897570475731243010 2017-08-15 21:27:32 UTC <KateDahls> @divafancypants That's a failure at every level. The graduate college ought to have a "completion award" for people like you who are SO CLOSE.

897468962602090498 2017-08-15 14:44:09 UTC <KateDahls> I recognize that there might be some weeks where no one comes prepared, but I'm hoping it might spark interesting discussion.
897468798953041920 2017-08-15 14:43:30 UTC <KateDahls> They can just search the hashtag. It's a class opener, and will only spend a few minutes on it a week. Also gave a list of rec'd follows.
897468491980312576 2017-08-15 14:42:17 UTC <KateDahls> I'm trying this semester: In syllabus I tell my students that every Friday I'll ask "What did the #twitterstorians talk about this week."
897433923277422596 2017-08-15 12:24:55 UTC <KateDahls> @KevinIsHistory why I thought Harper Lee's *Go Set A Watchman* had such an amazing conclusion. I'm a proud southerner bc imma fix this shit #scalawag
897258014713020417 2017-08-14 00:45:55 UTC <KateDahls> It makes me smile that the people took it down. What a klan-supporting social club puts up to remind folks of their "place." Some said nope.

896916571624493056 2017-08-13 02:09:09 UTC <KateDahls> @raulpacheco @TheTattooedProf You are the hero we need, man. 
896900582492917760 2017-08-13 01:05:37 UTC <KateDahls> @ProfessorBall No I'm genuinely interested in every opinion on this. Still have questions. But I'm intrigued by the concept. 
896899854370312192 2017-08-13 01:02:43 UTC <KateDahls> @ProfessorBall I stopped watching Maddow. Stopped reading the times. Was making me crazy. But I'm informed by this academic community of thoughtful posts.
896899397476167681 2017-08-13 01:00:54 UTC <KateDahls> @ProfessorBall But I don't think I use Twitter as intended. Don't follow many. Blocked Potus. Not interested in too much trolling efforts. Here 4 history
896898933959540736 2017-08-13 00:59:04 UTC <KateDahls> @ProfessorBall solid point. I'm teaching fortunate kids. I need them to understand their privilege. This place has become a refuge of sanity w/ my follows
896897151321731072 2017-08-13 00:51:59 UTC <KateDahls> @ProfessorBall Right, but it's accessible on laptops &library computers. I'd be expecting some deep dives into threads, w/note-taking. Cell phone no help.
896890796540137472 2017-08-13 00:26:43 UTC <KateDahls> @ussporthistory @AAIHS @NickSacco55 Oh absolutely, yes!
896889276541132802 2017-08-13 00:20:41 UTC <KateDahls> @igallupd Or do I keep it to scholars and historical societies & journals?
896889097758793729 2017-08-13 00:19:58 UTC <KateDahls> @igallupd Right. That's what I'm curious about...is there a line to cross? If they follow @tanehisicoates do I also have to make room for hannity?
896886877218799618 2017-08-13 00:11:09 UTC <KateDahls> @brianleechphd Yeah, I have some hesitation. I'd want to dedicate weekly discussion to this, and a substantive paper for a survey course. But 
896884789873172480 2017-08-13 00:02:51 UTC <KateDahls> @PainterNell @KevinLevin @KidadaEWilliams @Dr_ChadWilliams @megankatenelson @TheTattooedProf @jbf1755 @KevinMKruse @HC_Richardson Nazis and white supremacists are lazy academics. They are dumb on purpose. Anti-intellectualism and all that jazz. It's tired and lazy.
896884330550710272 2017-08-13 00:01:02 UTC <KateDahls> @PainterNell @KevinLevin @KidadaEWilliams @Dr_ChadWilliams @megankatenelson @TheTattooedProf @jbf1755 @KevinMKruse @HC_Richardson Right? I can't help but think if more people followed all the brilliant minds on twitter & went down thread rabbit holes, a  focus shifts.
896881378658205697 2017-08-13 23:49:18 UTC <KateDahls> @PainterNell @KevinLevin @KidadaEWilliams @Dr_ChadWilliams @megankatenelson @TheTattooedProf @jbf1755 @KevinMKruse @HC_Richardson Make learning and paying attention to the world outside your bubble cool again.

896880426676965376 2017-08-13 23:45:31 UTC <KateDahls> @jbf1755 @KevinMKruse @HC_Richardson Absolutely! And @TheTattooedProf & @megankatenelson ...it'd be easy to make a list. Soc media to be informed & culturally literate.
896764289989693444 2017-08-13 16:04:02 UTC <KateDahls> @KevinMKruse Plus...I mean, for the kids that do still Twiter...how awesome would it be if as many people followed @HC_Richardson as follow Kim K.?
896763693928767490 2017-08-13 16:01:40 UTC <KateDahls> @KevinMKruse they used history, beautiful writing, primary sources, and reading lists in order to explain trends in race, violence, guns, poverty.
896763300448538625 2017-08-13 16:00:06 UTC <KateDahls> @KevinMKruse What a fantastic essay prompt that would make. Pick one historian. Follow them and read their feeds for a month. Write an essay showing how
896762805939994625 2017-08-13 15:58:08 UTC <KateDahls> @EmilySenefeld But it's a free account. So I could make them create an account even if they only follow these folks and then they could delete it after.
896762427945226240 2017-08-13 15:56:38 UTC <KateDahls> @KevinMKruse But I don't know what I think about having Twitter be a part of the historical zeitgeist...is this a legitimate teaching tool?
896762251562168322 2017-08-13 15:55:56 UTC <KateDahls> @KevinMKruse I know some professors that have students follow a twitter handle built for that course specifically. It's a way to send out small tips.
896762027754049536 2017-08-13 15:55:03 UTC <KateDahls> So when @KevinMKruse takes on a GOP nutcase with a list of primary sources, I think a freshman in college could get something out of that.
896761800326344704 2017-08-13 15:54:08 UTC <KateDahls> ..can take a current event, historicize it, cite w/links to primary sources, and educate in a string of threads.
896761608046772224 2017-08-13 15:53:23 UTC <KateDahls> Legit question: How do #twitterstorians feel about assigning "follow these people on Twitter" as part of the coursework. I  how scholars
896749581010186240 2017-08-13 15:05:35 UTC <KateDahls> @mckellogs Fruit "leather," nuts, and applesauce are my go to in the office.
896749014191943681 2017-08-13 15:03:20 UTC <KateDahls> I don't think I've ever been more prepared to walk into a new semester. Educators, remember your influence. 18 year olds need a wheelhouse.
896503288857866240 2017-08-12 22:46:54 UTC <KateDahls> Anyway, bc of the last 36 hours, I'm just reminded of how fragile everything is and it makes me so sad.
896502823470469121 2017-08-12 22:45:03 UTC <KateDahls> This place had a free pickle buffet and a grilled Elvis sandwich. I LOVED IT. I love walking through downtown, love the music.

875885028655411200 2017-06-16 01:17:18 UTC <KateDahls> But I'm open to suggestions. If there's something I'm missing...teach me. (Thank you @The_Jordan_X  for calling out)
875884825747619840 2017-06-16 01:16:30 UTC <KateDahls> This ain't about me. I know that. But I want to be part of the solution. I'll teach and write and act in ways that work towards this.

875883735715123200 2017-06-16 01:12:10 UTC <KateDahls> Tell me what to do. I'm teachable. I'll make mistakes. But I won't quit. I'll be an advocate and an activist. But I'll also be a friend.
875883426049667072 2017-06-16 01:10:56 UTC <KateDahls> But I want my friends to know, black/white/brown, that I'm more than willing to be more than a voice. I'll act with you. For you.
875883144381161473 2017-06-16 01:09:49 UTC <KateDahls> With this #PhilandoCastle tragedy, I'm still unsure of how to  help. But I'm eager to do what I can. At this point, it's one on one convos.
875882775366299651 2017-06-16 01:08:21 UTC <KateDahls> But I was there. Mom and I were participants. During the drive there and back, she told me her Civil Rights stories. I listened. I learned.
875882561721044992 2017-06-16 01:07:30 UTC <KateDahls> We spent a few days in Charleston. Stood outside the church and paid respects. Hugged and cried with strangers. Did that fix anything? No.
875882251501936641 2017-06-16 01:06:16 UTC <KateDahls> I talked to  my black friends (notice the plural there). They said: be there, listen, learn. So I put my mother in my car and drove to SC.https://twitter.com/KateDahls/status/875881657366130688
875881910458867716 2017-06-16 01:04:55 UTC <KateDahls> A week later, a white supremacist walked into a church in Charleston. Gunned down a bible study.  For being black.  What could I do?https://twitter.com/KateDahls/status/875881657366130688
875881657366130688 2017-06-16 01:03:54 UTC <KateDahls> That evening, talking to a friend, I mentioned it. Saying, "next time, Imma have to step up and do something." Exercise my white privilege.
875881402390237184 2017-06-16 01:02:54 UTC <KateDahls> Alright. 2 summers ago a cop in McKinney, TX, pulled down a 15 yr old girl in a bikini. On camera. Her crime? Swimming while black.
875879435341361153 2017-06-16 00:55:05 UTC <KateDahls> @The_Jordan_X Tell me what to do bc at this point I only know to listen and learn. This shit is tiresome. But I also know my privilege protects me.

874624065624997888 2017-06-13 13:46:41 UTC <KateDahls> In Tennessee's Civil War, "Loyalty was a two-edged sword, and doubly dangerous because of the sides was labeled "politics.""
874623802390573058 2017-06-13 13:45:38 UTC <KateDahls> "Few devices of government can offer more benefit than to force potential enemies to expose themselves by refusing to swear."
874620572407402497 2017-06-13 13:32:48 UTC <KateDahls> "Loyalty tests..emerge from the felt needs of authorities during wars, rebellions, and periods of fear or subversion."  Too on the nose?

868547940427730946 2017-05-27 19:22:20 UTC <KateDahls> I think of the sidewalk that screamed of Spiro Agnew. I recognize that the Nixon era seemed the end days at time. Would the US persist?
868547609451003905 2017-05-27 19:21:01 UTC <KateDahls> What message will I leave to future Americans when a crisis of democracy occurs? They will look for it, as we look back. Movements & History
868547243317579776 2017-05-27 19:19:34 UTC <KateDahls> But now I think that carved exchange was never for Agnew. It was for us. Resistance generation to resistance generation. What will I carve?
868546936160346113 2017-05-27 19:18:21 UTC <KateDahls> I used to think, "Well why on earth would they direct their message to a man who will never read it?" Crime of opportunity, a bit misguided.
868546464229797888 2017-05-27 19:16:28 UTC <KateDahls> Anyway...on the sidewalk today you can still see insults carved into wet concrete and directed straight at Agnew. I remember it clearly.
868546072603492352 2017-05-27 19:14:55 UTC <KateDahls> FAU opened in the late 1960s and Nixon's first VP, Agnew, attracted hatred from many a student pop for his pro-war/anti-intellect stance.

863552833488134144 2017-05-13 00:33:34 UTC <KateDahls> @rothmanistan Buchanan only held that title until 1865. Andrew Johnson held it until Jan. 20, 2017. Trump will hold it until the end of this country.
863477061708656640 2017-05-13 19:32:28 UTC <KateDahls> Orrin Hatch? Is there evidence to support the claims beyond a sketchy blog post? Anyone?

863134172940029952 2017-05-12 20:49:57 UTC <KateDahls> 45 now demands loyalty above honesty, he places himself over the US when asking for whom shall a fed official serve. This is unsettling.
863133566837936128 2017-05-12 20:47:33 UTC <KateDahls> Loyalty is an action. A verb that demands a demonstration. It is a submissive role that recognizes the authority of a higher power.
863133454111825920 2017-05-12 20:47:06 UTC <KateDahls> Like a scar, Johnson made sure the soldiers who fought against the US Army would never forget.
863133369282048002 2017-05-12 20:46:46 UTC <KateDahls> The oaths seared into the memory of Confederate veterans. Men could give the exact date hed given it and a description decades later.
863133118290685957 2017-05-12 20:45:46 UTC <KateDahls> A gesture of open&active loyalty demands some humility for the occupied former Confederacy.The oaths at just a few sentences, grew hostile.
863132762160680962 2017-05-12 20:44:21 UTC <KateDahls> He developed an oath of loyalty. A petty man, Johnson looked upon Tennessees treason with personal bitterness.
863132668464177153 2017-05-12 20:43:59 UTC <KateDahls> Tennessees Reconstruction experience offered a template. Johnsons success would ensure redemption for war; his failure would motivate.
863132432245149696 2017-05-12 20:43:02 UTC <KateDahls> It also demonstrated what bureaucracy needed to develop that would address all this. Reconstruction as a concept was only just beginning.
863132242314506240 2017-05-12 20:42:17 UTC <KateDahls> Tennessee fell to the Union in 1863 and so its early Reconstruction model offered the nation a class on how Reconstruction might play out.
863132068422852609 2017-05-12 20:41:35 UTC <KateDahls> Andrew Johnson crafted and revised the loyalty oath while he served as the Military Governor of Tennessee.
863131910020714497 2017-05-12 20:40:58 UTC <KateDahls> I study loyalty, in all its forms, and it is the basis for my dissertation work.
863131837945831424 2017-05-12 20:40:41 UTC <KateDahls> Well, it happened. The word loyalty has been bandied about so much in the last 48 hours, that it seems as if I cant escape weighing in.

786939050867486720 2016-10-14 14:37:45 UTC <KateDahls> @HuffPostPol @Dr_ChadWilliams I like to think that's a canned answer for when she's put on the spot. She had to have known they are awful.

785862408036347904 2016-10-11 15:19:33 UTC <KateDahls> @dandrezner @HstrnsAgstTrump you assume he has scholars on his team? Educated at Trump University, I presume.
785613702783442944 2016-10-10 22:51:17 UTC <KateDahls> I love that folks are self identifying as deplorable on their Twitter handles now. It makes it so much easier to disregard the bullshit.

785271669850071040 2016-10-09 00:12:10 UTC <KateDahls> @EmilySenefeld the petticoat affair comes to mind.
785162187891470336 2016-10-09 16:57:07 UTC <KateDahls> I hear ya. The fact that my husband of 8 years had NO IDEA this had happened. Or that there are SO MANY MORE stories...
785154414516531206 2016-10-09 16:26:14 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls And Donald Trump ought to register as a sex offender. Because, goddamnit, he's admitted his guilt.
785154254705229824 2016-10-09 16:25:36 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls It's time to start telling our stories. Because the good guys don't know how systemic it is. They don't know how far it goes.
785154069883187200 2016-10-09 16:24:52 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls And then I told him that every woman he knew has gone through this at some point in her life. That #rapeculture is real.
785153892812263424 2016-10-09 16:24:10 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls Today I told my husband that someone once grabbed by boob. A stranger. He seemed shocked. And for that I love him.
785153762428092421 2016-10-09 16:23:39 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls So, yes, Trump's actions are offensive. But his entitlement to a woman's body is shared by many. Every woman knows this.
785153580072366080 2016-10-09 16:22:55 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls Here I was in a combat situation, and now I'm scared of my brother in arms.
785153451328172032 2016-10-09 16:22:24 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls Women are often put into situations where men they trust assume the female body is something they can trespass without fear.
785153205583904772 2016-10-09 16:21:26 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls From what I can tell, he felt entitled to walk into my aid station and watch me sleep. He didn't find it problematic.
785153030417154048 2016-10-09 16:20:44 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls Once he left I ran down the hall to the Flight Operations room, found a girlfriend, and started shaking uncontrollably.
785152860594077697 2016-10-09 16:20:04 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls He grabbed me by the shoulders. "Why don't you like me like I like you?!?!" I put my books on and escorted him to the door.
785152653126934532 2016-10-09 16:19:14 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls Calmly, I asked what he was doing. I was going through a messy divorce. This guy knew it. I guess he liked me. Not mutual.
785152483928764416 2016-10-09 16:18:34 UTC <KateDahls> @KateDahls I woke up to find on of my fellow soldiers sitting in the dark watching me. Scared the hell out of me. I sat up.
785152225475788801 2016-10-09 16:17:32 UTC <KateDahls> Working in the Aid Station in Iraq one night, on a 24 hour shift, I grabbed a nap in the middle of the night. Door unlocked, feeling safe...
784894069260611584 2016-10-08 23:11:43 UTC <KateDahls> Have we made @realDonaldTrump register as a sex offender yet? What's the holdup? #TrumpTape #Rapeculture #ImWithHer

781494080656252928 2016-09-29 14:01:22 UTC <KateDahls> Tristan Rettke. Let's not let him escape his deliberate efforts in maintaining white supremacy. He wanted the notoriety. Name him.https://twitter.com/TheRoot/status/781488723733147648
781492235875524608 2016-09-29 13:54:03 UTC <KateDahls> Harder to opt out of discussions when your skin color already assumes you exist to be a problem to solve, through extralegal force if needed
781491781062037504 2016-09-29 13:52:14 UTC <KateDahls> 5) Then they realized that their classmates of color are not afforded that luxury. White folks only see white supremacy if they decide to.
781491384075313152 2016-09-29 13:50:40 UTC <KateDahls> 4) Once white students understand that their world-view was tailor made for them, that they only have to see racism if they choose to look,
781491148510597120 2016-09-29 13:49:43 UTC <KateDahls> 3) Some of the children of Sally Hemmings went on to pass. They, too, had the privilege to opt out of difficult conversations. Hard choices.
781490831693910017 2016-09-29 13:48:28 UTC <KateDahls> 2) The mental gymnastics he required to live a life utterly disconnected from reality had to have taken a toll on him, but what of his kids?
781490598763257856 2016-09-29 13:47:32 UTC <KateDahls> 1) Teaching the hypocrisy of Thomas Jefferson in class as a way to understand white deflections from conversations about race.

758685152797138948 2016-07-28 15:26:50 UTC <KateDahls> I still get angry when I see Jenna Bush on The Today Show. Dubya might have asked his daughters to serve in a war fought for their granddad.

758684653947588608 2016-07-28 15:24:51 UTC <KateDahls> Perhaps if warhawks paid a little more attention to those that serve they might recognize a blue star or gold star when they saw one.
758683851690536961 2016-07-28 15:21:40 UTC <KateDahls> @drhonor & when I showed up on the first day of the semester in crutches....well, explaining myself raised some eyebrows. #firstimpressions
758679739351625728 2016-07-28 15:05:20 UTC <KateDahls> @drhonor Two years ago I tore my ACL. It was the summer before starting my doctoral program at UGA. How'd I do it? Drunken. Musical. Chairs.

751908825603641349 2016-07-09 22:40:08 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 so here: I should have called your words racist, not you. For that I apologize.
751908670150209536 2016-07-09 22:39:31 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 I believe you. We are all a bit tense right now. It's been a helluva summer and the heat doesn't help.
751907872611692544 2016-07-09 22:36:21 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 and this is just the wrong week to use that word, man
751907790638252032 2016-07-09 22:36:01 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 so when @UGAfootballLive called you out, it no longer mattered that you didn't use it racially. It was put out for all to see.
751907523574304768 2016-07-09 22:34:58 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 if any of the UGA FB  team saw your tweet, they'd make the same (admittedly mistaken) inference I did. They know what it means.
751907033952161792 2016-07-09 22:33:01 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 no one is asking you too. But if you see how the word is used to harm, you see why it's not cool to use it, even if ur not racist
751906737570115584 2016-07-09 22:31:50 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 I'm not talking overt racists like the KKK. I'm talking systemic racists that encourage redlining. It's powerful bc it's subtle
751906278017011712 2016-07-09 22:30:01 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 ask your black friends about the word and what it means when racists use it.
751905900110184448 2016-07-09 22:28:30 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 go back and look at some of those articles I tagged you in. Hillary aside, this isn't about politics. You harm folks using them.
751905565434056704 2016-07-09 22:27:11 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 if you were the only person to ever use the word, it'd be fine. But it's been appropriated and widely recognized. It hurts others
751905256557125632 2016-07-09 22:25:57 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 "uppity" "thug" "civilized" ...all these words are used to insinuate something. If you don't mean them THAT way, don't use them
751904517122293762 2016-07-09 22:23:01 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 well we don't get to choose how the world interprets words or how others use them to inflict harm.
751904274100154368 2016-07-09 22:22:03 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 hate me and cuss me all you want. The next time you hear the word "thug," I hope you'll think about how it's being used.
751903800462602240 2016-07-09 22:20:10 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 well now you know.
751903118795890688 2016-07-09 22:17:27 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 hounded you if you used fa**ot. I'd have berated you if you used "uppity." Some words hurt others regardless of how you intend
751902867196444672 2016-07-09 22:16:27 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 at this point I'm inclined to believe you. But that word, like c*nt and n***er, has meaning and you used it publicly. I'd have
751901235008143360 2016-07-09 22:09:58 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 did you use the term "thuggin"? Then, yes, you used a racist word when talking about UGA players.
751900906493534208 2016-07-09 22:08:40 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 "Thuggin" was a shite word to use. It's been demonstrated as a racist code word. You aren't racist? Then stop using it. Simple.
751900652159336448 2016-07-09 22:07:39 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 or, keep calling me a fucking douche because I hurt your delicate sensibilities.
751900320503042048 2016-07-09 22:06:20 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 then fucking man up and admit that it was a mistake to say thug.
751900220481568769 2016-07-09 22:05:56 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 you're defending your right to be ignorant. In doing so, it comes off as racist. If you're not, and at this point I believe you
751899950762565633 2016-07-09 22:04:52 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 if your innocent, recant or rephrase your tweet. Don't fall on the sword of racism just to get under my skin. It looks racist.
751899686479491072 2016-07-09 22:03:49 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 that you won't admit you shouldn't have used the word says more about you and your insecurities than anything.
751899269334962176 2016-07-09 22:02:10 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 Your defense of the term is both alarming and lamentable.
751899156772454401 2016-07-09 22:01:43 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 Ask any AA in this country what it means when you say thug.
751898992003411968 2016-07-09 22:01:03 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 your race is a non-issue. Your word choice is poor and your stubbornness is lamentable. Ask black football players what it means.
751898623131156484 2016-07-09 21:59:36 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 if you aren't racist, don't use racist language when you offer a back-handed compliment to a mostly black team.
751898416456798209 2016-07-09 21:58:46 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 we only read what you said, not what you meant. If you didn't mean it as racist, choose another word.
751898203327434753 2016-07-09 21:57:55 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 but, "fuck my code," right? I'm the only one who knows it?
751898056023502848 2016-07-09 21:57:20 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 what you meant is irrelevant. The word you used is categorically unacceptable unless you want others to infer the code.
751897768889901056 2016-07-09 21:56:12 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 don't care what color you are. I care what language you use when criticizing a predominantly black team.
751896817244274689 2016-07-09 21:52:25 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 and you still won't admit it was a poor word choice. But keep cussing at me. It's really convincing.

751895945575559168 2016-07-09 21:48:57 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 I'll call out racism when I see it. Even if it's based in willful ignorance. Your staunch defense of the term only hurts you.
751895592952037376 2016-07-09 21:47:33 UTC <KateDahls> @UGAfootballLive @edOG5585 and your hating me is your problem. Not mine. I'll sleep just fine.

751883294929747968 2016-07-09 20:58:41 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 so you are clearly reluctant to learn. Google could have taught you in five minutes. Now you're wasting my time. Good luck in life
751879843130798080 2016-07-09 20:44:58 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 in light of recent events it's a small wonder folks get hyper-vigilant. Are you the solution or the problem?
751879630026633217 2016-07-09 20:44:07 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 Google "thug" and "coded language." Then decide if that's the type of person you want the public to see you as on this platform.
751879367442194432 2016-07-09 20:43:05 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 it's not my fault you chose the word. It is everyone's responsibility to educate about it. Seriously, a simple google search shows
751878105451601920 2016-07-09 20:38:04 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 well I'd rather be accused of pretentiousness than bigotry. Carry on.
751876599792955392 2016-07-09 20:32:05 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 we can only read the words you write, not the words you mean. Know better, then do better.
751876196175060992 2016-07-09 20:30:29 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 why else do you think you are getting this response on Twitter? Words have power. It's up to you to know how to use them.
751875859611615232 2016-07-09 20:29:08 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 perhaps you should crack a book or two and educate yourself on the power of language. You are perpetuating something systemic.
751875159028531200 2016-07-09 20:26:21 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 words like "thug" have a history. It's a coded language of racism. I teach these athletes. Thugs they aren't.
751874956531789824 2016-07-09 20:25:33 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 if you want to be congratulated for outing your bigoted rhetoric, that's on you. It surely wasn't meant as a compliment.
751873789101740032 2016-07-09 20:20:55 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 for calling you a bigot? You are more than welcome.
751873396779130881 2016-07-09 20:19:21 UTC <KateDahls> @edOG5585 @TyBarrow the term "thuggin" tells you all you need to know about this person. Bigot is as bigot does. And shameless to boot. Ugh.
751872187640877057 2016-07-09 20:14:33 UTC <KateDahls> @UGAfootballLive @edOG5585 well that's about the most heavily coded language you could have used. Congrats on outing yourself.

746080327483953152 2016-06-23 20:39:46 UTC <KateDahls> @dsathens Totally agree. Or folks that know that an AR-15 has no business in the hands of a demonstrably bad dude, but are bought by @NRA
746078739331678208 2016-06-23 20:33:27 UTC <KateDahls> The smart ones knowingly work for a man who would destroy this country. They do it anyway, just to watch the world burn. That's terrifying.

746078261982167042 2016-06-23 20:31:33 UTC <KateDahls> I think what terrifies me most about Trump are the folks who work for him. Most of them, sure, are probably ignorant angry hacks. 1/3

746018331241615360 2016-06-23 16:33:25 UTC <KateDahls> We have our lectures. We have our positions. We've been talking to ourselves for entirely too long. It's time to bridge the gap. Be heard.
746018136093261824 2016-06-23 16:32:38 UTC <KateDahls> I want reasonable debate. I want action. @repjohnlewis told us to stand. I'm listening. Let's teach #history and do better.

746016529242816518 2016-06-23 16:26:15 UTC <KateDahls> A teach-in that looks at immigration, islamophobia, homophobia, and Big Business. Stand and let #history be heard. Make action happen.
746016126866456576 2016-06-23 16:24:39 UTC <KateDahls> An "Election 2016" teach-in. Something that addresses #history of race violence and injustice, gender inequality, rape culture, gun violence
