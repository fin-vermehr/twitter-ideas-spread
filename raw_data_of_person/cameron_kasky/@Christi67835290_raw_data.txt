Plus the coyotes freak me out a little. I have 2 German Shepherds who are my first line of defense and they will give me time to get the guns

967858996588752896 2018-02-25 20:29:01 UTC <Christi67835290> @realDonaldTrump @RichardSkipper @djzya @austin_baker513 @DougFlowers6 Well that's whole different issue. Lol let's just stick with this one for now.

It's the same with drugs alot of people who need MH are self medicating. It's a viscous circle.
967857312504401920 2018-02-25 20:22:19 UTC <Christi67835290> @austin_baker513 The gun turned out to be a lighter that looked like a real gun. The dumbass could have been killed because no one knew it was a lighter

Now I go find my neighbor. Now what if I had to 10 days. In now I've had time to think about it and not let my anger get the best of me see where I'm headed...

When I got my first gun permit do you know how long I had to wait...i turned it in to the sheriff at 8;30  and picked it up at 12. This was to purchase my .40 clock. Less than 4 hrs. I became a gun owner.

Do you have any idea how scared I was for my son. I drove so fast to that school that I pulled in on 2 wheels. My only thought was to get him out of that class now!

It's working out the details that seems to have everyone turned upside down. I don't want to get a text from my other son saying there is a shooter in his school.

What if you had to 10 15 20 days to take possession of the gun. Sometimes cooler heads prevail.

We also need a better database that if someone is on a no fly list they should also not be able to purchase a gun.

How about the mass shooting in Vegas? What about the kid who shot up the church in South Carolina,  was he a felon?  Now if I recall correctly the Pulse shooter was on the no fly list but not a felon. So that why I ask your point

967065673032785920 2018-02-23 15:56:38 UTC <Christi67835290> @realDonaldTrump @RichardSkipper @djzya It's hilarious to me that you think liberals are not gun owners. I'm a gun owner but I want these types of guns and high capacity mags banned.

It's just like the bible you can have 10 different people read it and come up with 10 different interpretations. Regardless the spin you want to put on it, it doesn't clarify what kind of gun.

Who by the way, are no longer children. They are adults.

My son doesn't do his homework his action will receive a consequence at school then at home. Does that make me a bad parent..nope! For every action the is a consequence.

We give them the tools and hope that they use them and are good decent people but we can't control everything in their life. Something will slip thru the cracks.

And let's face it schools are the biggest targets for the mass shootings.  And don't tell me to home school, I work as does my husband.

They also help people receive treatment. No federal money pays for abortions except in the case of rape or mothers life is in danger.

And no one is telling you to have an abortion, if you don't want one then don't have one. See I fixed that problem.  And as far as selling the body parts that was all a lie by 2 anti abortion.

How about not have a military parade that cost 10-3o million dollars. Or how about that wall? Instead put it into mental health and people with disabilities.
965022881972412417 2018-02-17 00:39:18 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 @Honey_Holly_LM But they see it on the news too.  Mental health is so complex. There are so many things at play. As a parent I can say no to a movie or music.  When he turns 18 I can't stop him from purchasing this gun.
965022378886619136 2018-02-17 00:37:19 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 @Honey_Holly_LM People that have mental illness will see the things games/movies like you say, but people without mental illness can and do know the difference. Which goes back to mental health. We tell parents whose children can't determine life from fantasy to not allow these things in th home

Other things do need to be done but for the now, until people are willing to fund mental health we have to start somewhere.
965019747573293057 2018-02-17 00:26:51 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 As far as drugging in this state for most drugs must be done by psychiatrist and not an MD.

965018792752541697 2018-02-17 00:23:04 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 @Honey_Holly_LM There is no overnight fix to this...but we can remove one thing and that's the gun. I don't want to ban all guns. But look at the role this one has played in most mass shootings.
965018481451307009 2018-02-17 00:21:49 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 @Honey_Holly_LM I don't disagree with you that there are things in some homes that need to be fixed but HW can we go into someone's home and do that. If a child is removes and put into foster care sometimes that's worse than where they were removed from.

965017691911319552 2018-02-17 00:18:41 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 There are so many possibilities but unless I know a parent is a shitty parent then I will never pass judgement.
965017391402049536 2018-02-17 00:17:29 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 I know children who their parents have tried and done everything possible to help them from meds, therapy, camps you name it. Some people are born mentally ill. Some are products of environment.  Being abused at home, being abused by someone who was trusted being bullied...
965016816006455297 2018-02-17 00:15:12 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 Let me ask you this, do you have first hand knowledge of every mass shooter?
965016563421253632 2018-02-17 00:14:12 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 @Honey_Holly_LM It would take yearssssss for all of those things to be worked on..in the time being ban the goddamn gun. And magi zines that hold more than 15 bullets!

Another start would be to put money back into mental health. Do you know how much funding has been taken away from this field?
965012769748680704 2018-02-17 23:59:08 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 @Honey_Holly_LM So your solution is to send sympathy and prayers. What does that accomplish.  It's easy for you to say all this, but it wasn't you or your child being gunned down and murdered while at school.
965011533204983808 2018-02-17 23:54:13 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 Oh sweetie I see you know nothing about mental health. You think parents don't seek help for their children? Do you know how many meds and counseling sessions parents go to in order to try to help their child get well. Must be awesome to be a perfect parent to a perfect kid.
964999088948285440 2018-02-17 23:04:46 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 Because I work in the mental health field....there is a lot more than "bad parenting" at play here. What do you not understand about that?
964990564633587712 2018-02-17 22:30:53 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 @Honey_Holly_LM If the gun wasn't there to purchase then perhaps more would have survived.  If the laws were different maybe a 19 year old mentally ill young man would not have been able to purchase the gun. Children are dying for the 2nd amendment.
964987317055303685 2018-02-17 22:17:59 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 @Honey_Holly_LM It was the same when I went to school but guess what we don't live in those times any longer. Time for prayers and debate are over. Take a step forward and ban this gun! By the way I am a multiple gun owner.
964977409861791746 2018-02-17 21:38:37 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 I have an idea for all of you who thinks banning this gun isn't the solution tell it to the kids who witnessed their classmates and teachers being gunned down. Tell the kids who were texting their parents their goodbyes and I love yous because they thought they were going to die.
964974641851850752 2018-02-17 21:27:37 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 My kids being killed while at school is infringement of my rights!
964970544629198850 2018-02-17 21:11:20 UTC <Christi67835290> @TomiLahren The time for sorry and prayers are over!  It's time to protect our children. War has been declared!  I'm done sitting on my hands while my kids may die while sitting in a classroom. Ar-15s  should be banned! No one in the general public should own this gun.
964968870976073730 2018-02-17 21:04:41 UTC <Christi67835290> @lisarinna @JanetParks3 So you think it's the parents fault? Hmmm Las Vegas shooter was 64? Didn't the Sandy Hook shooter murder his mother? Guess she's at fault too. Having AR -15S is the common in most of these mass shootings. Ban them! The general public should not have access to these guns.
964961305332469765 2018-02-17 20:34:37 UTC <Christi67835290> @marcorubio Stop being a coward Marco! Or throwing others under the bus because they voted the same way you did. How old are you 5? Stand up even if it means you stand alone. Help protect our most precious assets. Ban AR-15 to the general public. It's a start to saving many lives!

Ar-15 need to be banned from the general public. And you believing you can tell people to never contact you again because you can't handle the truth proves yr a coward!

It's definitely not the Constitution of the United States of America.  Which is what our soldiers and most Americans fight for. 45 is a shit show.  He cares nothing about this country with the exception of how much money he can make.
