971545744032215040 2018-03-07 00:38:50 UTC <lisascheff> @GrayMattersTwit Fair. Also there are a bunch of different "rest of us"s. I was thinking specifically of the Democrats generally(if that makes sense)--yes, of Congress(es), all of them who have failed to get meaningful/lasting reform.

967069268364931072 2018-02-23 16:10:55 UTC <lisascheff> NRA money is BLOOD money. Let's take a pledge: If you are a politician who takes money--ANY money--from the NRA, you will never get my vote. PERIOD. Give the money back and pledge never to take another dime, then you can earn my vote. Until then, you are invisible to me.
967069266913742849 2018-02-23 16:10:55 UTC <lisascheff> Even out of the hands of people with mental illnesses. Now they oppose raising the age on who can buy an AR-15 to 21. They are armed terrorists holding the country hostage and killing our children.  Isn't it time we took a zero tolerance policy towards the NRA?
967069265370210309 2018-02-23 16:10:54 UTC <lisascheff> For decades the NRA has taken a zero tolerance policy towards ANY efforts to regulate guns, even the mildest and most reasonable. Background checks, limiting access to assault weapons, waiting periods, keeping guns out of the hands of people with DV convictions.

944731293060911106 2017-12-23 00:47:47 UTC <lisascheff> @rowdygirlsranch So I suppose what happens realistically is that Mueller recommends beginning impeachment proceedings and relies in part on the fact that  when asked questions like, "Did Putin tell you he was trying to throw the election for you?" T invoked the 5th. Not a great look.
944730629257728000 2017-12-23 00:45:08 UTC <lisascheff> @rowdygirlsranch I'm thinking this through while I'm typing. Never a great idea.
944730565034602497 2017-12-23 00:44:53 UTC <lisascheff> @rowdygirlsranch is simply that the jury considers everyone else's testimony and frankly it just looks bad not to testify. In this case, though, Mueller is gathering evidence for a recommendation to Congress. So if T takes the 5th, less evidence for M to rely on . . .
944730131821662209 2017-12-23 00:43:10 UTC <lisascheff> @rowdygirlsranch Well now, that would be a wild ol' constitutional ride! He can definitely take the 5th. We just don't compel people to incriminate themselves (or lie under oath) in this country, ever. Ordinarily the consequence, say in a criminal trial  . . .

And let me tell you, I'm bi/pan and when I clicked the "no straight people" button my life got instantly better, even though I was still interacting with people of all genders.

944620755161100288 2017-12-23 17:28:32 UTC <lisascheff> @roseveleth "sexy" "horny" and "lover" are dirty words? Trafficking in sex shame seems like a bad marketing choice.

943513337656238082 2017-12-20 16:08:03 UTC <lisascheff> If you've ever wondered what being ratio'd on Twitter looks like or a representative ignoring their constituents, take a look at @SenatorCollins last few tweets.
943513022328385536 2017-12-20 16:06:48 UTC <lisascheff> @SenatorCollins Shame on you. This bill is a Trojan horse to steal from the poor and give to the rich and you know it. Or you don't because no one has had time to actually read it. There are 2 rock solid reasons to oppose this bill. Shame.
943170312283107328 2017-12-19 17:25:00 UTC <lisascheff> Have you considered changing parties? Really, what do the Republicans have that's attractive to you at this point? That even makes sense?
943170025111695366 2017-12-19 17:23:51 UTC <lisascheff> I mean, @SenBobCorker too, but I expected better from you, @SenatorCollins.
943169837836021760 2017-12-19 17:23:07 UTC <lisascheff> Shame on you, @SenatorCollins, selling out the American people for empty promises. You are one of the few people in this country who has some actual power to do something tangible right now to stop the destruction of our democracy and you are squandering it.
943168140740935680 2017-12-19 17:16:22 UTC <lisascheff> Congrats, Ted Cruz. Being the stupidest person on Twitter is no mean feat these days.
943163372165513216 2017-12-19 16:57:25 UTC <lisascheff> @raesanni Not everyone carries trauma from violent crime. Sometimes someone is mugged or whatever, and they heal physically and don't carry the feelings of helplessness and shame that make up trauma. But with sex crimes I think it's almost impossible not to carry trauma.
943162934783389697 2017-12-19 16:55:41 UTC <lisascheff> @raesanni Yes, everyone processes trauma differently. My guess is this is especially true for sexual violence because we live in a culture with so much sex shame, we all have incredibly complicated relationships with our sexuality.

921417850140680192 2017-10-20 16:48:29 UTC <lisascheff> @washingtonpost I see red, I wonder if it's time for the bomb shelter. My heart drops Every. Single. Time.

898331523882958848 2017-08-17 23:51:40 UTC <lisascheff> @rowdygirlsranch He is not loyal to Trump, he is loyal only to the goal of destroying government via distrust. So yes I think Bannon did this intentionally.

897602364634484741 2017-08-15 23:34:15 UTC <lisascheff> Trump just gave white supremacists a loving hand job on live tv. Congress must impeach NOW if the country is to survive.
