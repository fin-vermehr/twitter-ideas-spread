971882713136402432 2018-03-08 22:57:50 UTC <MissionResist> If I was to run for the Presidency, I believe I could win in a landslide. I have no urge, no whispering in my ear, no real reason to want to do it, but after this historic debacle, I just may.

965374593191079936 2018-02-18 23:56:53 UTC <MissionResist> My guns are secured tightly. Always have been. But, who's to say that my house is broken into (highly doubtful because I am ex-military and have a fortress) and that gun winds up on the street.

965371792155127808 2018-02-18 23:45:45 UTC <MissionResist> I don't own many guns, but I have a few. My most prized is the 30-06 that a very dear friend of mine gave me. It has no other meaning to me than that. I will be turning it in to be destroyed tomorrow.
965370529992658944 2018-02-18 23:40:44 UTC <MissionResist> I am torn, to say the least. I uphold what I believe is right, the Constitution. But, I am but a slave to it as well. I believe in my right to bear arms against those that would act to enslave me. I also have a greater power about me that sees that this is not the way.
965368870960844800 2018-02-18 23:34:09 UTC <MissionResist> After what I have gone through as a 20-year retired military man, I am going here...guns kill people, and the higher grade weapons kill more people.

959968141873991681 2018-02-03 01:53:35 UTC <MissionResist> Time to come clean...raised BOLDLY GOP in a red state. Joined the military, done my duty for 20 years. BUT...when the Bush clan sent me to war over oil riches they were seriously invested in, and after having witnessing first-hand the atrocities, I chose something better.

942181344595075072 2017-12-16 23:55:12 UTC <MissionResist> I still hold belief that "true character" is determined by how a person deals with adversity.

941066091266301952 2017-12-13 22:03:34 UTC <MissionResist> The end-game to all of this is exactly the same that it was in Nov 2016. The GOP agreed to back DT and all that he brought with him.

940043400912420864 2017-12-10 02:19:46 UTC <MissionResist> Regarding #Resistance, a HUGE fan (as if you couldn't tell)! It's time to take things to the next level. Nominate those persons that you would follow into battle, (share a foxhole with) to end this horrible genocidal fascism that has befallen us. I nominate @RepAdamSchiff
940036251033395201 2017-12-10 01:51:21 UTC <MissionResist> @Ollie_Sharlene Very proud to have your follow. Love what you have to say about this crazy world we live in. #CanadaUSAUnited
940034009685311489 2017-12-10 01:42:27 UTC <MissionResist> When all is said and done, powerful women will lead this country back from the brink. It's time for all men to come to terms with their past immoral acts, profess their shame, rid themselves of the lies and hope for absolution.
940033801031258114 2017-12-10 01:41:37 UTC <MissionResist> Americans are proud, strong, and brave above all else. We will persevere and that will come, as it always has, with great sacrifice. The battle lines have been drawn and we already have an army willing to do the battling. What we need is leaders willing to press the fight. @DNChttps://twitter.com/iamfonda/status/940032178481651713

938899004460593152 2017-12-07 22:32:21 UTC <MissionResist> I would attribute it to "Deep Throat". Watergate to the 10th power. HE IS GOING DOWN AND CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.https://twitter.com/RealMuckmaker/status/938898291558727681
938898195110907904 2017-12-07 22:29:08 UTC <MissionResist> Just in case you missed it...45 was so completely and ridiculously unintelligible in his speech about Israel... I AM SCARED TO DEATH ABOUT AMERICA AND THE WORLD IN GENERAL! #BuildYourBunker
938896644074082304 2017-12-07 22:22:58 UTC <MissionResist> As a military minded individual, I understand the sacrifice of a few to save the many. I hope that is what the Dems have in mind after @alfranken debacle. #MeToo was meant to rid our society of ALL sexual predators...@realDonaldTrump and his GOP cronies have to go down as well
938559320731586560 2017-12-06 00:02:34 UTC <MissionResist> Born and raised a "Christian", yet I defile the hypocrisy of it all. Albeit, I am consumed by an apocalyptic end to humanity as we know it at the hand of some God. #TheEndIsNear #TrumpIsSatan
938551175087050754 2017-12-06 23:30:12 UTC <MissionResist> I, for one, applaud the Dems for saying that they do not want, nor need someone who makes unwanted sexual advances toward others. I also want the GOP to do the same...but, they won't. Their convictions are in their wallet.
938547744242839552 2017-12-06 23:16:34 UTC <MissionResist> OOPS! Forgot to *** the pussy-grabber thingy. Probably banned by the same people that let him tweet anti-muslim pornographyhttps://twitter.com/MissionResist/status/938547194633904129

937834216980713472 2017-12-04 00:01:16 UTC <MissionResist> When I #UnfollowMcCain I noticed he still hadn't hit his goal of 3M followers. I don't think he will make that mark actually...numbers are going down and he will be lucky to have 3,000
937832429963890688 2017-12-04 23:54:10 UTC <MissionResist> How do I approach this? Every time I do, we grow farther apart!
937832220643020801 2017-12-04 23:53:20 UTC <MissionResist> She still believes that women are only speaking out about abuse because they have an "ulterior motive". She believes that they are lying and it is just to "gain attention" or "further their careers".
937831352644317185 2017-12-04 23:49:53 UTC <MissionResist> The other thing that is weird is that she is 99.9% republican...I don't get that...still trying to comprehend how "brainwashing" can cause someone to still see things in such a skewed way.
937830401573314560 2017-12-04 23:46:06 UTC <MissionResist> But, time and love perseveres. After being apart for 26 years, we are now happily married (5 years) and living a semi-normal life FULLY in love.
937829751078686720 2017-12-04 23:43:31 UTC <MissionResist> I have known about the abuse since we were teens and "dating". The one thing that kept us from being inseparable at that time was...the domineering father...who used every trick in the book to keep us apart.
937827253890830338 2017-12-04 23:33:35 UTC <MissionResist> *With full approval of my wife* She was molested by her father her entire life. He escalated the molestation from the age of 5 until she was 14. She became the mother of his daughter. THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT THAT STATEMENT that could be described as "NORMAL". #StopTheMadness
937820683362557952 2017-12-04 23:07:29 UTC <MissionResist> The "swamp" is alive and flourishing with the "Flood" of lobbyists that 45 said he would get rid of. They bought America once again for their own personal gains. I am pulling out the shotgun! #NeedToCutDownOnHalo #Namaste #Zen
937817679695671297 2017-12-04 22:55:33 UTC <MissionResist> I truly believe he will be the 'Person of the Year'.

937801943036162050 2017-12-04 21:53:01 UTC <MissionResist> @SenJohnMcCain I stood by you as a brother-in-arms for many years. Now...I #UnfollowMcCain. Why, not because of what you stood for as a military man, but because what you stand for now is no longer relevant to me and hurtful to all but the wealthy Americans.
936742958195445760 2017-12-01 23:44:59 UTC <MissionResist> I was feeling the exact same way. The "Boston Tea Party" was the cornerstone of what "taxation without representation" embodies. It was one of the keys to the truly Democratic society that we treasure today.

936081707933020161 2017-11-29 03:57:25 UTC <MissionResist> When you step back and ponder it all, everything can be put in a nutshell. Men are horrible. Famous men are more horrible. BUT, men in politics are the devil incarnate. True fact. Because they can get away with it and make others believe that they did no harm.

The racist things that come out of this human's mouth are horrendous and worthy of censor.

936067789563056128 2017-11-29 03:02:06 UTC <MissionResist> Just in case I didn't make myself clear enough...I ABHOR @realDonaldTrump for being a sexual predator, just like my wife's father who impregnated her at the age of 15...after nurturing her from the age of 5. #WHYAREYOUSOFUCKINGDEPRESSED?
936066218452291585 2017-11-29 02:55:52 UTC <MissionResist> I LOATHE @realDonaldTrump Simple as that. Always have, always will. Not so much for the political @realDonaldTrump as much as the "shady businessman" @realDonaldTrump. When it comes right down to it though, I just LOATHE @realDonaldTrump for being @realDonaldTrump
936063165015777280 2017-11-29 02:43:44 UTC <MissionResist> I challenge everyone I follow to #VoiceTheirOpinion I can get the news easily enough, I can RT it, and I do if it calls for it. But, I would really like to hear some "personal" stories about how this craziness is affecting you personally. I will keep tweeting my stories for sure.
936061409896599553 2017-11-29 02:36:45 UTC <MissionResist> I have a voice, I have a legal right to speak my mind and I WILL at all costs. It will be heart-felt, well-thought-out, with meaning and with purpose. It will not be the "politically correct thing to say probably". But, #WomenMatter
936058491818663937 2017-11-29 02:25:10 UTC <MissionResist> Asked by my family many times..."Why do you detest Trump so much?" "Why do you persist in attacking him so savagely? "Why have you shunned what you were taught and gone 'rogue' against your conservative values?" My values are with those that can't express them without persecution
936055219011584001 2017-11-29 02:12:09 UTC <MissionResist> EVERYTHING that I have stated about the current state of affairs concerning the great women of our country is coming to full force fruition in the face of the Matt Lauer firing. THIS will be the epicenter of it all. #WomenStrong

THEY hold firm and deserve the right 2 have their dignity held in the highest regards. GOP says they have the right 2 decide what is best choice for their bodies. UGH!!!!
935699131074600963 2017-11-28 02:37:11 UTC <MissionResist> We went from a semi-normal existence to a full-on-radical semi-existence. What shall follow my brothers and sisters? Non-existence?

933092536012324865 2017-11-21 21:59:31 UTC <MissionResist> Raised in conservative Northern Indiana, went into the military, where I spent my 20 year career in Florida, Oklahoma. I know, better than most, the #TrumpEffect. Southern conservatives are god-fearin' hypocrites. They will sell their soul to the Devil himself to keep women down
933090049737887744 2017-11-21 21:49:38 UTC <MissionResist> @chrislhayes I welcome you all to the #TrumpEffect. Warned my friends, family, neighbors...now I have no family or friends...just neighbors that give me the "evil-eye". #LifeIsReal
933084915473711104 2017-11-21 21:29:14 UTC <MissionResist> @2B_Painfree @JasonOverstreet There will always be @GOP unfortunately. They are very good at lying to, and manipulating the less fortunate. They will ALWAYS support those opposed to women's rights, or more succinctly, human rights. They are maggots! The Conservative "Christians" eat that up by the bowl-full!
933082329190424576 2017-11-21 21:18:57 UTC <MissionResist> Just to reiterate what I said before, there is NO reason for sexual, nor any other type of harassment, in this world.  We are all human beings, we all should have the EXACT same rights. No colors, no politics, and MOST DEFINITELY no differences between the sexes of our species.
933080250094882820 2017-11-21 21:10:42 UTC <MissionResist> So, not a huge fan of "horror" films other than those from the past. But I am enthralled by what I have read about "Get Out!" Any thoughts before I put myself through another boring, cookie-cutter, slasher movie?

932752993010798592 2017-11-20 23:30:17 UTC <MissionResist> Let's not remember that the so-called tax plan is probably not #45s tax plan. He just want to put his name on something that he can bully us into all believing will be "better for us". THIS travesty is on the GOP as a whole!
932752049682436096 2017-11-20 23:26:32 UTC <MissionResist> 1 thing to say about the @alfranken discussion. This is a man that may have went too far on occasions. I do not condone that behavior. Period! But, he is NOT the same sexual predator as our POTUS. THAT is another level of indecency towards women.
932746094836178947 2017-11-20 23:02:53 UTC <MissionResist> I am foretelling that the Dems will show up in huge numbers to put an end to the travesty of justice and moral corruption that the GOP and the @realDonaldTrump administration is doing to our society. #Resist #ResistFascismhttps://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/931251232920014849

931294200209072128 2017-11-16 22:53:34 UTC <MissionResist> I will also say that I know not every situation is the same. There needs to be an investigation into each and every accusation. AND fessing up and apologizing for any wrongdoing goes a long way in any effort to make amends for those wrongs.
931289817203212290 2017-11-16 22:36:09 UTC <MissionResist> Here's the thing, sexual harassment IS sexual harassment, regardless of your political views.

929842518392524800 2017-11-12 22:45:06 UTC <MissionResist> @realDonaldTrump is the WORST thing that has ever happened to America. I am so horrified right now. Oh, and I fought in the Gulf War, mobilized against the 9/11 attack, poured my heart and blood out for a better America for over 20 years. I am done!

929835445780992006 2017-11-12 22:17:00 UTC <MissionResist> I question the Virginia electoral process on their reasons to throw away military absentee ballots. Is this legal? I am retired military and submitted many absentee ballots. Did they all end up in file 13??
929833970916843520 2017-11-12 22:11:08 UTC <MissionResist> @luvauntyruth @votevets So, my question I guess is, HOW, legally, can they do this? I am a retired Veteran and have cast many absentee ballots because I could not be there while fighting for my country. Can anyone tell me how this works?Were my votes
929832336933511169 2017-11-12 22:04:39 UTC <MissionResist> @WalshFreedom Our justice system allows for "presumed innocence" and I am proud to support that as a retired veteran and an American.
