971806032715550720 2018-03-08 17:53:08 UTC <kagleslie> @LibbySchaaf @SteveKingIA How dare you tell any woman what to do with their bodies?  Stop it.
971748538496495616 2018-03-08 14:04:40 UTC <kagleslie> @jeffsessions @SteveKingIA I would love to discuss this with you at your next town hall meeting...oh, right.
971747954808762368 2018-03-08 14:02:21 UTC <kagleslie> @ArtPicsChannel @MariaBoedeker Beautiful
971732968912891904 2018-03-08 13:02:48 UTC <kagleslie> It is #InternationalWomensDay  Kick ass everyone.
971541485421301765 2018-03-07 00:21:55 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst How about urging a ban on assault style weapons?  That would be good. #NeverAgain
971527459513528320 2018-03-07 23:26:11 UTC <kagleslie> Hope Hicks told House Intelligence Committee she was hacked, sources say https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/hope-hicks-told-house-intelligence-committee-she-was-hacked-sources-n854601.  Oh the sickening irony. Can we say but her emails now?
971525974042071043 2018-03-07 23:20:16 UTC <kagleslie> @MattMurph24 I am torn here. Part of me really really hopes you are right. The other part of me NEVER WANTS TO SEE THEM. You cant unsee something like that.
971525346255392769 2018-03-07 23:17:47 UTC <kagleslie> @SenAlexander @SenBobCorker You know what else would be good?  Banning assault style weapons. Civilians do not need weapons of war.
971525025424650246 2018-03-07 23:16:30 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley So what about those sanctions Chuck?
971499758987685888 2018-03-07 21:36:06 UTC <kagleslie> @WmWallace1911 @NRA @Wherethelov1097 Here is the text of the second amendment. Note the phrase well regulated militia.  That means the government can regulate gun ownership.pic.twitter.com/js13fJxHGU
971498525426176002 2018-03-07 21:31:12 UTC <kagleslie> @krassenstein If this was President Obama the @GOP would be completely frothing at the mouth screaming for his resignation.
971498202989060096 2018-03-07 21:29:55 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @jeffsessions @SteveKingIA I thought you were all about stares rights Steve.  Or is that only when you agree with what the state is doing?
971473891813142529 2018-03-07 19:53:19 UTC <kagleslie> @JoyAnnReid I took Econ 101 in college. So am I qualified?
971473136398077957 2018-03-07 19:50:19 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst Nice photos but I dont think you really care about those kids or their safety. And I have 3.1 million ways to prove it.
971438120544686081 2018-03-07 17:31:11 UTC <kagleslie> @JenAshleyWright When I was in 1st grade the teacher would tell the girls to line up for the bathroom and the boys to line up for the lavatory. It took almost the whole year to realize the boys were not going to a laboratory.
971437327250804738 2018-03-07 17:28:01 UTC <kagleslie> @JenAshleyWright @agentsdelfuturo So did I!
971436446212075520 2018-03-07 17:24:31 UTC <kagleslie> @BetsyDeVosED I havent seen a classroom that looked like that in years.
971435804315848704 2018-03-07 17:21:58 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @ProudResister A horrible person clearly.
971435569686503426 2018-03-07 17:21:02 UTC <kagleslie> @CorporatePiggie What is wrong with that 29%?
971435292254236672 2018-03-07 17:19:56 UTC <kagleslie> @Uber No thanks. Wont use a company that doesnt do background checks on their drivers.
971385365729808384 2018-03-07 14:01:33 UTC <kagleslie> @Alt_FedEmployee That made me laugh.  Thanks.
971382673729048576 2018-03-07 13:50:51 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You do know one of the causes of the Great Depression was trade wars and tarrifs?  Is that what you mean by Make America Great Again? #VoteThemOut

971202862872178688 2018-03-06 01:56:21 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst You really should send back that NRA blood money.  What are you doing to protect our kids from getting murdered in school?  #NeverAgain #VoteThemOut
971202445459193856 2018-03-06 01:54:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You haven't chosen anyone wisely so far.  Like rats leaving a sinking ship.
971122620786774023 2018-03-06 20:37:30 UTC <kagleslie> I just watched the @ErinBurnett interview with Sam Nunberg OMG she must have been exhausted by the end of it. I was tired just watching.
971088894623125515 2018-03-06 18:23:29 UTC <kagleslie> @MSNBC Trump is always saying things will happen in a couple of weeks. Ill believe it when I see it.

971073617101500416 2018-03-06 17:22:46 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst What are you doing about the sanctions Joni?
971014628447866881 2018-03-06 13:28:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Stop it.
971014363434889216 2018-03-06 13:27:19 UTC <kagleslie> @kylegriffin1 Yes Sam, if you refuse to respond to the subpoena, you will go to jail.
971010463290023938 2018-03-06 13:11:49 UTC <kagleslie> @nowthisnews I just don't think I could bring myself to try it.
971008721257156608 2018-03-06 13:04:54 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You had a deal.  You refused to sign it.  Stop trying to blame the Dems for a crisis of your own making.
971008518533926917 2018-03-06 13:04:05 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Why haven't you implemented the Russian sanctions that Congress voted for almost unanimously?
970883266113916928 2018-03-05 04:46:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, which is is?  Did Obama launch an investigation into the Trump campaign and possible collusion, or did he do nothing about Russian meddling?  You can't have it both ways.
970883059150188545 2018-03-05 04:45:34 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You created this crisis with an executive order.  You had a deal on the table and you turned your back on it.  This is on you and the @GOP.
970882636590788608 2018-03-05 04:43:53 UTC <kagleslie> @RogueNASA I want to go hang out with penguins.  Sounds fun.
970879500186783745 2018-03-05 04:31:25 UTC <kagleslie> @ALT_uscis Well his usual strategy is to refuse to pay for anything.  Maybe that's his plan.
970862840591601665 2018-03-05 03:25:13 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley What about the sanctions Chuck?  What are you doing about that?  Showing up is great, but you actually have to do something once you get there.
970706721034391553 2018-03-05 17:04:51 UTC <kagleslie> Please bring back Obama.  #TriggerTrumpIn4Words
970706100239699969 2018-03-05 17:02:23 UTC <kagleslie> @rosieatlarge No. It is never too early for pizza.
970647523466629120 2018-03-05 13:09:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump What about those Russian sanctions?  We are waiting.
970646950646370305 2018-03-05 13:07:21 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I would say if you are really worried about the drug problem in the US, start with the opioid deaelers in big pharma.  Just a thought.
970645722063429632 2018-03-05 13:02:28 UTC <kagleslie> Oh this is so cool.https://twitter.com/oldpicsarchive/status/970509218590707713

970642968788029443 2018-03-05 12:51:32 UTC <kagleslie> I do love to watch the #Oscars  But I am not accustomed to staying up so late.  It is going to be a long day.

970434184358526976 2018-03-04 23:01:54 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst But what about the sanctions Joni???

970407597806415872 2018-03-04 21:16:15 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Any mention of the Russian Sanctions?  Stay focused Chuck.

970104380954431490 2018-03-03 01:11:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I see you fixed the typos and bad spelling.
970103983019905024 2018-03-03 01:09:47 UTC <kagleslie> @SincereSnwflake Great.
970103876425867269 2018-03-03 01:09:22 UTC <kagleslie> @krassenstein This is actually my greatest fear about 45.  That he will just cancel the 2020 election and declare himself president for life.

969558660602040320 2018-03-02 13:02:52 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Until they start implementing tariffs of their own.  How about that stock market yesterday?

969235287623852032 2018-03-01 15:37:54 UTC <kagleslie> @TomiLahren It doesnt matter what you call it. What matters is there is no reason at all for civilians to have access to weapons of war.

969231125628555265 2018-03-01 15:21:22 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Why arent you pressuring the president to enforce the Russian Sanctions?  Why are you taking blood money from the @NRA. #VoteThemAllOut
969030872124010496 2018-02-28 02:05:38 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst So then why did you vote to increase the deficit so you could give a huge tax break to the wealthy?  This tweet has zero credibility.

968613518965657602 2018-02-27 22:27:13 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Im assuming you mean rape victims. What about the women who have accused the president of sexual misconduct. What are you doing to help them?

968217479863468033 2018-02-26 20:13:30 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Dont you think it should be harder to get an AR-15 than it is to get a bottle of sudafed?
968201345332326401 2018-02-26 19:09:23 UTC <kagleslie> @nowthisnews Easy to make that claim after its all over. I dont believe a word of it.
968171845634740225 2018-02-26 17:12:10 UTC <kagleslie> @CuteEmergency I love him so much.
968138504311058432 2018-02-26 14:59:41 UTC <kagleslie> @JacobAWohl Um, did you miss school when they talked about the Japanese internment camps?  What about the Trail of Tears?  What about that?
968137606746828800 2018-02-26 14:56:07 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley @SenJoniErnst @SteveKingIAhttps://twitter.com/JoyceWhiteVance/status/968111136318066689
968136380521033729 2018-02-26 14:51:14 UTC <kagleslie> @Lin_Manuel I love it!
968101434553192449 2018-02-26 12:32:23 UTC <kagleslie> @knittaphd Yes!  Let's make the price of a magazine for an AR-15 $5,000 or even $10,000.  I like it.
967940614636625920 2018-02-25 01:53:20 UTC <kagleslie> Yes or no:  Is a pop-tart a sandwich?
967759573007437824 2018-02-25 13:53:56 UTC <kagleslie> @knittaphd Socks for me. Weasley sweater for The Boy. Sky scarf also for The Boy. (Its his senior year of HS  and part of his graduation present)
967580733119303680 2018-02-24 02:03:18 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @realMatMolina Don't give him any ideas.
967531325459697664 2018-02-24 22:46:58 UTC <kagleslie> @TrueCar Thank you.
967468586913730560 2018-02-24 18:37:40 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_rates @valerieraer Such a good dog.
967468019944325120 2018-02-24 18:35:25 UTC <kagleslie> @jk_rowling Is that good or bad?
967451231047299072 2018-02-24 17:28:42 UTC <kagleslie> @DSMLiberal @united Thank you.
967430758108467200 2018-02-24 16:07:21 UTC <kagleslie> Delta and United join list of companies to cut ties with the NRA http://cnnmon.ie/2owawS6 via @CNNMoney
967430229277990912 2018-02-24 16:05:15 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA What are you going to do to keep our kids from being murdered in algebra class?  #NeverAgain #GunReformNow #VoteThemAllOut
967244975460282368 2018-02-23 03:49:07 UTC <kagleslie> @RealJack Yes, they dropped the ball.  However, it doesn't change the common denominator in these mass shootings:  AR-15s.
967244788847214592 2018-02-23 03:48:22 UTC <kagleslie> @CoreyLMJones No, 17 students and 4 armed teachers would be dead.  A handgun against an AR-15 is a suicide mission.
967244538615037952 2018-02-23 03:47:23 UTC <kagleslie> @HoosierMAGA219 @JackPosobiec @patriotmary_ "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."  The key words here are "well regulated".  That means gun laws are indeed constitutional.
967225198364844032 2018-02-23 02:30:32 UTC <kagleslie> @knittaphd Terrifying.
967223359208673280 2018-02-23 02:23:13 UTC <kagleslie> @NRA My favorite part of the second amendment is the phrase well regulated. Something you seem to oppose. You have blood on your hands.
967219468643561472 2018-02-23 02:07:46 UTC <kagleslie> @Hertz Thank you.
967219119551647744 2018-02-23 02:06:22 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Russian sanctions now. Ban bump stocks ban AR-15s register all guns. Then resign.
967139633669791744 2018-02-23 20:50:31 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did they ask why you are okay with kids getting AR-15s and murdering them during class?
967099826939858944 2018-02-23 18:12:21 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Im starting to notice a theme in your meetings. Guns keep coming up. Maybe you should listen to us.
967099593581301762 2018-02-23 18:11:25 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley No guns in schools. Enforce the Russian Sanctions. #GunReformNow
967043779806064641 2018-02-23 14:29:38 UTC <kagleslie> @TuckerCarlson @CNN @realDonaldTrump More lies.
967043631289782272 2018-02-23 14:29:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Lots of better smarter people.
967043576348717057 2018-02-23 14:28:50 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are the one who created the DACA crisis with your executive order.  And this is all on you.
967042491810832385 2018-02-23 14:24:31 UTC <kagleslie> @StephenKing More than just a tad chickenshitty in my opinion.
966863565796847616 2018-02-22 02:33:32 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Ban assault weapons. Ban bump stocks. Enforce the Russian sanctions. Then resign.
966819040923717633 2018-02-22 23:36:36 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley You should return your NRA blood money.
966758909942882305 2018-02-22 19:37:40 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill This is a joke, right?
966758291098480640 2018-02-22 19:35:12 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Stop taking blood money from the @NRA. History has its eyes on you.
966727929785962497 2018-02-22 17:34:34 UTC <kagleslie> @The_Trump_Train Bots are not people. They dont have first amendment rights. Also Twitter is a corporation. They get to make the rules. If you dont like it dont use Twitter. Pretty simple.
966708957090926595 2018-02-22 16:19:10 UTC <kagleslie> @CPAC @NRA My right to stay alive supersedes your right to play with automatic weapons.
966708430194003968 2018-02-22 16:17:04 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley So while children die in mass shootings you sit and collect @NRA money. Stop it.
966679390225608709 2018-02-22 14:21:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This is a terrible idea. I love my kids, and I have great respect for their teachers.  I have friends who are teachers.  I would never expect them to put themselves in harm's way for my kids.  And that is what you are asking them to do.
966677522023899136 2018-02-22 14:14:15 UTC <kagleslie> @toddstarnes @mspmef @Vzladream Well, and the gun in his hand.
966677388913496064 2018-02-22 14:13:44 UTC <kagleslie> @toddstarnes If that US Senator was an @NRA shill, I would give him or her a standing ovation, bake them a cake, and throw them a party.
966520058934644736 2018-02-21 03:48:33 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Shame on you for using these kids for a PR stunt.  If you really care about preventing future mass shootings propose some #GunReformNow.  Stop pandering to the @NRA and do something.
966439218854748161 2018-02-21 22:27:20 UTC <kagleslie> @FLGovScott @SincereSnwflake Hes a coward.
966439138726764549 2018-02-21 22:27:00 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Anything about gun reform, or how to keep our kids safe?
966429704835256323 2018-02-21 21:49:31 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley I have 52,380 questions for you. Why are you accepting blood money from the @NRA?  We deserve better. You work for our best interest not the NRAs
966419651688325121 2018-02-21 21:09:34 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Implement the #RussianSanctions
966388425497694208 2018-02-21 19:05:29 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump What do you know about Christianity?
966388331234975745 2018-02-21 19:05:07 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Obamas imposed sanctions and expelled Russian entities. What have you done. I mean besides refuse to enforce the sanctions Congress voted to enact.
966384513160007680 2018-02-21 18:49:57 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Our children are being murdered in their classrooms. Do something.
966311390863556608 2018-02-21 13:59:23 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA What are you doing to stop our kids from being murdered in school?  Thoughts and prayers are not adequate.
966176727679619073 2018-02-20 05:04:17 UTC <kagleslie> @JoyAnnReid I believe Anita.
966097331090227200 2018-02-20 23:48:47 UTC <kagleslie> @SenatorCollins Gun violence is a health issue too. Do something.

965967867249295360 2018-02-20 15:14:21 UTC <kagleslie> @70s_party @msleedy Thats what I thought too.
965946515008249856 2018-02-20 13:49:30 UTC <kagleslie> @HunterHammersen because k2p2 ribbing is SO BORING to knit.

965945146868142080 2018-02-20 13:44:04 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Dems didn't draw the new map.
965944954701910016 2018-02-20 13:43:18 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Obama expelled Russian Nationals, closed Russian compounds and enacted sanctions.  So far you have......... refused to enforce the sanctions Congress voted to enact and repeatedly said you "believe Putin".   #MuellerIsComing
965943939931963392 2018-02-20 13:39:16 UTC <kagleslie> @SincereSnwflake Oh that made me laugh.  Thanks.
965799097608392705 2018-02-19 04:03:43 UTC <kagleslie> If watching the #Olympics were an olympic sport, I would have multiple gold medals.

965792959252877312 2018-02-19 03:39:19 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Have you read it?
965792869842857984 2018-02-19 03:38:58 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @Chrisvega25 @jeffrey_evanson That would be great.
965732974351273985 2018-02-19 23:40:58 UTC <kagleslie> @marcorubio How much money did you get from the @NRA?
965732414197813248 2018-02-19 23:38:44 UTC <kagleslie> @limixn321 So would I.
965732167211978752 2018-02-19 23:37:45 UTC <kagleslie> @krassenstein Oh boy.
965731947942219776 2018-02-19 23:36:53 UTC <kagleslie> Happy #PresidentsDay2018 @realDonaldTrumphttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/965722941299351552
965706304793841665 2018-02-19 21:54:59 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did you talk about those 13 indictments?
965671814662885378 2018-02-19 19:37:56 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley What are you going to do to protect my children while they are getting an education?  I am your constituent and I want to know.
965630952620818432 2018-02-19 16:55:34 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did any of them ask what you are doing to keep them from being murdered in class?  #GunReformNow
965595481660411910 2018-02-19 14:34:37 UTC <kagleslie> Happy #PresidentsDay2018 @BarackObama.  Please come back.  We need an adult in the White House.
965594023233810434 2018-02-19 14:28:49 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump People are burying their children not far from you and you are attacking a private citizen?  Get a grip.  Be a grown up.  Resign and do us all a favor.
965593771193880577 2018-02-19 14:27:49 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I think you should reflect on what you will do to stop our children from dying while they try to get an education.  And then reflect on how you will look in that orange jumpsuit once Mueller comes for you. #GunReformNow #MuellerIsComing
965426409421393921 2018-02-18 03:22:47 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Any comments on those 13 indictments?  How about the 17 dead children in Florida?
965425146159919104 2018-02-18 03:17:46 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley What about those 17 kids murdered in Florida?  Any thoughts?

965308399066939392 2018-02-18 19:33:51 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley You are on the wrong side of history sir. We need to enact the #RussianSanctions and we need #GunReformNow. You have blood on your hands.
965235080288526337 2018-02-18 14:42:30 UTC <kagleslie> @mrjamesob Oh my heart.
965234594483245057 2018-02-18 14:40:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Those indictments have you worried dont they?
965234149945733123 2018-02-18 14:38:49 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Actually you lost the popular vote. And this clearly still bothers you. Grow up.
965227392095703040 2018-02-18 14:11:57 UTC <kagleslie> @gazettedotcom @SenJoniErnst Do something about the Presidents sexual misconduct. His victims deserve justice too.
965097320193974272 2018-02-17 05:35:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley So how about those sanctions?  Do something.
965096883160076288 2018-02-17 05:33:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley @SoozleMcDoozle That is a good question.
965096462215507968 2018-02-17 05:31:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley @VickyEmerson @KarinaTejas So did I.
965040353488392193 2018-02-17 01:48:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You created the DACA problem with an executive order and have twice refused to sign a bipartisan solution. This is your own damn fault.
965039527374065664 2018-02-17 01:45:27 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Without that AR-15 in the hands of a mentally disturbed child they would probably all be alive today.
965039017174749184 2018-02-17 01:43:25 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Well FB is trying to cover its ass. There was collusion. Everybody says so. Except you and your base. I hope to see them walk you out of the Oval Office in handcuffs.
964993736106180608 2018-02-17 22:43:30 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are starting to sound worried.
964993443889139713 2018-02-17 22:42:20 UTC <kagleslie> @nypost @realDonaldTrump Um no.
964992343890939904 2018-02-17 22:37:58 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Well then what are you doing to pressure Trump to enforce the Russian sanctions?  Ill wait.
964919398678106113 2018-02-17 17:48:06 UTC <kagleslie> Keep up the pressure on Iowa lawmakers - let's make sure they vote with gun sense!http://every.tw/2ExyKC8
964918194438836224 2018-02-17 17:43:19 UTC <kagleslie> @DeViLhErSeLfIE It is very weird.  And very sanitized.  No victims, no patients, nothing.  And why a thumb's up?  WTAF.
964866773878177792 2018-02-17 14:18:59 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst History has its eyes on you. Stop taking @NRA blood money. We need #GunReformNow

964679344156299265 2018-02-16 01:54:13 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst Did they ask what you are going to to prevent more mass shootings in our schools?
964634499995795456 2018-02-16 22:56:01 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did anybody ask what you were doing to stop another mass murder in our schools?
964634186832384000 2018-02-16 22:54:46 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst @ChuckGrassley @SincereSnwflake Stay classy RNC.
964633548199268358 2018-02-16 22:52:14 UTC <kagleslie> @BeaglesResist Absolutely. And tell Trump to stay the hell away.
964633198473957377 2018-02-16 22:50:51 UTC <kagleslie> @SpecialOlympics @SenatorCollins Its just too bad they will have so much trouble getting Medicaid and other assistance thanks to the huge tax cut the @GOP gave the wealthy.
964632019559907331 2018-02-16 22:46:10 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Just like those kids murdered by a white supremacist gunman on Wednesday, right?
964596734956535808 2018-02-16 20:25:57 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I knew you would be sending panic tweets today. You are starting to sound like a scared old man.
964587276243173376 2018-02-16 19:48:22 UTC <kagleslie> @BravenakBlog Same.
964587191178616834 2018-02-16 19:48:02 UTC <kagleslie> Still say there was no collusion @realDonaldTrump?https://twitter.com/thehill/status/964586701241888768
964550326346018816 2018-02-16 17:21:32 UTC <kagleslie> @TheTweetOfGod Okay you have a point.
964550013509668865 2018-02-16 17:20:18 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 I finished How to Stop Time a week ago and I still have a book hangover.
964549700102868992 2018-02-16 17:19:03 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill This is vile and disgusting. And isnt buying votes illegal?  #GunReformNow
964549128419192833 2018-02-16 17:16:47 UTC <kagleslie> @car_nove Carly, my heart goes out to you and everyone at your school and dealing with this. Youre right, this is about guns and it has to stop.
964525652211793921 2018-02-16 15:43:30 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Im pretty sure you just said you would veto the proposed bipartisan legislation. This is on you and the @GOP. Not the Democrats.
964513220802367488 2018-02-16 14:54:06 UTC <kagleslie> @RepSwalwell I dont want to live in the OK Corral. I want common sense gun laws. Thoughts and prayers are not enough.
964512591639928832 2018-02-16 14:51:36 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA @LilaGraceRose Too bad she wont have Medicaid to cover any problems she may have down the road.
964512358264725504 2018-02-16 14:50:40 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA What about the white supremacist who. murdered 17 people on Wednesday?  Any thoughts?
964495737882017793 2018-02-16 13:44:38 UTC <kagleslie> I am so stealing this idea.
964490745548804101 2018-02-16 13:24:47 UTC <kagleslie> @funder Hes a POS.
964490527319248896 2018-02-16 13:23:55 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA How about policy changes and getting the AR-15 off the streets?  Because so far praying for gun violence to end doesnt seem to be working.
964313420949540864 2018-02-15 01:40:10 UTC <kagleslie> @SoozleMcDoozle Really, this is the very least they could do.
964313030078140416 2018-02-15 01:38:37 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Many victims of mass shootings can't say anything because they are dead.   #TheNRAisaterroristorganization #VoteThemOut2018 #GunControlNow
964283274494390274 2018-02-15 23:40:22 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Or how about keeping guns out of the hands of children and the mentally disturbed?  Nobody needs an AR-15 to go hunting. Thoughts and prayers arent enough. Do something.
964282045701804032 2018-02-15 23:35:29 UTC <kagleslie> @krassenstein @BeaglesResist And probably a cake too.
964281865183154176 2018-02-15 23:34:46 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley @SoozleMcDoozle Of course not. He doesnt even have guns as an option in the pull-down menu of subject options on his email contact form. Coward.
964266670868041728 2018-02-15 22:34:24 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Too little too late.
964266576970244096 2018-02-15 22:34:01 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_feelings What a good boy.
964250628175355904 2018-02-15 21:30:39 UTC <kagleslie> @StephenKing Smart girl.
964133746122379265 2018-02-15 13:46:12 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill @judychris95 Do you really think he ever prays?  Or has thoughts?  Personally, I kind of doubt it.
964133504551477249 2018-02-15 13:45:14 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill @GirlNamedBoston You are right, of course but he is still a coward.
964133327220432897 2018-02-15 13:44:32 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Coward.  But it's probably for the best since he is already blaming everybody but Cruz and the gun he had with him.
964133029919805441 2018-02-15 13:43:21 UTC <kagleslie> @EdKrassen I suspect she is hoping for that as much as we are.
964132018899611648 2018-02-15 13:39:20 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Don't you dare blame the victims for this you POS.  You know what would have worked better?  If a 17 year old KID didn't have access to smoke grenades, a gas mask and an AR-15!  Grow a pair and stand up to the NRA.  We need #GunControlNow.
963992540042203136 2018-02-14 04:25:06 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill According to the @GOP, it's never an appropriate time to talk about gun control.  #BloodOnTheirHands
963982253264199680 2018-02-14 03:44:13 UTC <kagleslie> I want common sense gun control. I want to know that people who shouldn't have guns, don't have guns. I want politicians representing me that have the balls to stand up to the NRA. And if you won't, I won't vote for you. It's that simple. #GunControlNow
963982189699399682 2018-02-14 03:43:58 UTC <kagleslie> I am so angry.  I don't want to live in the OK Corral. I don't want to worry if the next school shooting is going to be at my son's school, or my daughter's university. I don't want to wonder every time I go to a concert or anything with a big crowd "Is this a safe place?"
963904161938059264 2018-02-14 22:33:55 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst Over $3 MILLION from the @NRA in your pockets. We need #GunControlNow   Thoughts and prayers are worthless.
963902030669582336 2018-02-14 22:25:27 UTC <kagleslie> @SenatorCollins #GunControlNow. Thoughts and prayers dont cut it.
963901721260052480 2018-02-14 22:24:13 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley We need #GunControlNow.  This has got to stop. Thoughts and prayers are worthless.
963901388538499075 2018-02-14 22:22:54 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley What about the fatal shooting in Florida?  Anything to say about that?  If you dont have the courage to stand up to the NRA and vote for some gun laws to stop this garbage we will find someone who will. #GunControlNow
963840510078177281 2018-02-14 18:20:59 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Oh the sickening irony.
963776103667118080 2018-02-14 14:05:03 UTC <kagleslie> Happy day everyone.  Eat all the chocolate. #ValentinesDay2018
963546499304120322 2018-02-13 22:52:41 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst Too bad your party is trying to slash Medicaid and other assistance she and other Special Olympians may need.
963490335736385536 2018-02-13 19:09:31 UTC <kagleslie> Yes.https://twitter.com/suezinohio/status/963485797503651842

963489001935114241 2018-02-13 19:04:13 UTC <kagleslie> @rosieatlarge Personally, I would go for the PB&J but that's just me.
963488348886224897 2018-02-13 19:01:37 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Enforce Russian  Sanctions Now
963439900287754240 2018-02-13 15:49:06 UTC <kagleslie> @StephenKing That about sums it up doesnt it?
963439773800173569 2018-02-13 15:48:36 UTC <kagleslie> @Adaripp Definitely rooting for you.

962869939966275584 2018-02-11 02:04:17 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill And how is he planning on paying for this?
962679654908768257 2018-02-11 13:28:10 UTC <kagleslie> @DMRegister @SenatorShaheen @SenJoniErnst What about the women who have accused @realDonaldTrump?  They deserve justice too.
962560452512436224 2018-02-10 05:34:30 UTC <kagleslie> @kylegriffin1 Only 12?
962460942612205568 2018-02-10 22:59:05 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 @BootstrapCook What about dogs?
962460642329415680 2018-02-10 22:57:53 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Yes!  Yes!  Do it!
962438424136507393 2018-02-10 21:29:36 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst What about the sexual predator in the Oval Office?
962420805492723713 2018-02-10 20:19:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Do the Central Park Five sounds familiar at all?
962133968308105217 2018-02-09 01:19:48 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Not surprised. It doesnt fit his narrative. Coward.
962133809121685504 2018-02-09 01:19:10 UTC <kagleslie> Now I have a book hangover.
962018589996797952 2018-02-09 17:41:19 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill @CharmingMatty That. Would. Be. Amazing.
962008965348405250 2018-02-09 17:03:05 UTC <kagleslie> Sitting in the Des Moines airport reading How To Stop Time by @matthaig1   You must all read this book at once. I dont even care that my flight is over an hour late.
961998405085138945 2018-02-09 16:21:07 UTC <kagleslie> @70s_party That is absolutely terrifying.
961988260787605505 2018-02-09 15:40:48 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA What about that $1.9 trillion deficit?
961910478183325697 2018-02-09 10:31:44 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA If you are so concerned about the rule of law why arent you holding the President accountable for enforcing the #RussianSanctions?
961451605689339904 2018-02-07 04:08:20 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Good for him.
961451302067818496 2018-02-07 04:07:07 UTC <kagleslie> @TrumpStore @DonaldJTrumpJr @GenWashington64 A dream come true.
961397370935300101 2018-02-07 00:32:49 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Resign.
961396908492312577 2018-02-07 00:30:59 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA So what are your thoughts about the President ignoring the rule of law and not enforcing the #RussianSanctions?
961396696587612160 2018-02-07 00:30:09 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA So you arent really pro-life. You just want to keep women barefoot and pregnant producing worker bees. SMH.
961348107773595649 2018-02-07 21:17:04 UTC <kagleslie> @DeptofDefense @SASCMajority @SenJoniErnst Will you be discussig when you will be implementing the #RussianSanctions?
961303673434525697 2018-02-07 18:20:30 UTC <kagleslie> @DeViLhErSeLfIE I love it.

961243125015629824 2018-02-07 14:19:54 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley What are you doing to push the President to enforce the #RussianSanctions?
961243005201076224 2018-02-07 14:19:26 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley When will you be releasing the #DemocraticMemo?  If you are so concerned with transparency we have a right to see it.
961242814142087170 2018-02-07 14:18:40 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst Why isn't the President enforcing the #RussianSanctions?  Do something.
961047823885185024 2018-02-06 01:23:51 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill So what are you going to do about the #RussianSanctions @ChuckGrassley?
961047183347896320 2018-02-06 01:21:18 UTC <kagleslie> @RoseNels1951 $130,000 is nowhere near enough money for that.  There isn't enough money for that.
961046864241012736 2018-02-06 01:20:02 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump He would not approve of what you are doing.
961046439945220097 2018-02-06 01:18:21 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill I did not know Jesus was stripey.  Also, you can't fix stupid.
961045933818511361 2018-02-06 01:16:20 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Ah, one step closer to the dictatorship he so desires.
961000801924780033 2018-02-06 22:17:00 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill So what exactly was he doing when he said he would love a shutdown?
961000353520148480 2018-02-06 22:15:13 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Why hasnt the president implemented the #RussianSanctions?  Do something.
960980759141076995 2018-02-06 20:57:21 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill But he votes in lockstep with the @GOP every time.
960916637527486465 2018-02-06 16:42:34 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Hows the Dow doing so far today?
960916533538062338 2018-02-06 16:42:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How many of them dont want a wall?
960916444967002112 2018-02-06 16:41:48 UTC <kagleslie> @Colts @realDonaldTrump And yet you immediately use this tragedy for political purposes. Disgusting.
960915119608881153 2018-02-06 16:36:32 UTC <kagleslie> @70s_party Or he can make his own damn eggs.
960864942361579520 2018-02-06 13:17:08 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Okay, I will skip watching the closing ceremonies then.
960677280644321280 2018-02-05 00:51:26 UTC <kagleslie> I miss Barack Obama
960632056177885184 2018-02-05 21:51:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The Dow dropped more than 1000 points today.
960630554768134144 2018-02-05 21:45:46 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley What are you doing about implementing the #RussianSanctions?  Anything?
960626567629094912 2018-02-05 21:29:55 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Snowflake
960626298195410945 2018-02-05 21:28:51 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley What are you doing about those Russian Sanctions?
960583454617456643 2018-02-05 18:38:37 UTC <kagleslie> So where is the rule of law here @SteveKingIA?https://twitter.com/martinheinrich/status/959540168251322368
960576928569806848 2018-02-05 18:12:41 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA I am your constituent and I support DACA. Try listening to us for a change.
960549538514817025 2018-02-05 16:23:50 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Seems pretty simple. You had a bipartisan deal that you refused to sign after promising you would. Nobody to blame but yourself and the @GOP.
960549133949067267 2018-02-05 16:22:14 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I am pretty sure Devin Nunes is on the wrong side of history here, just like you.   #MuellerIsComing
960506769767305216 2018-02-05 13:33:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Norway has universal health care too.
960506634169667585 2018-02-05 13:33:21 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump We all deserve health care.  Not just the wealthy.  I've lived in England, Canada, Italy and Australia, all of them have universal health care.  It works.  The current NHS protests are about conservative cuts to the NHS.  Stop lying.
960505689591468033 2018-02-05 13:29:36 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Probably not a good idea to attack the people you are supposed to be working with.  It makes you look weak and scared.  Release the Democratic rebuttal and your taxes while you're at it.   #MuellerIsComingForYou .
960341415279710208 2018-02-04 02:36:50 UTC <kagleslie> @Amy_Siskind I liked it.

960290429043380224 2018-02-04 23:14:14 UTC <kagleslie> While I dont want anyone to get hurt. I think the best outcome tonight is for the field to open up and swallow both teams, making Justin Timberlake the super bowl champion.  #SuperBowl52
960262852027256832 2018-02-04 21:24:39 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA More and more the memo looks like a desperate bid by the @GOP to discredit the DOJ and FBI.  A warrant means a judge thought there was probable cause.  If the judge didn't think there was probable cause there would be no warrant.

959888514899988480 2018-02-03 20:37:10 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley There is no such thing as chain migration. Its called family reunification. And the president had a bipartisan solution. He walked away from it.  This is all on the @GOP
959860942334038017 2018-02-03 18:47:36 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA @GOP has the House Senate and WH. But you cant get anything done. (Not that Im complaining). Maybe the @GOP is the problem.
959822828328628226 2018-02-03 16:16:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump That means 51% think Trump is doing a bad job.  Math.
959822731624812545 2018-02-03 16:15:46 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So less than half of the people in a conservative poll think you are doing a good job?  And this is a good thing?
959822467626930176 2018-02-03 16:14:43 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump All I see is a man desperate to discredit the FBI and the #Mueller probe before he goes down in flames.  #MuellerisComing
959640661032136707 2018-02-02 04:12:17 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley History has its eyes on you.
959545385084694528 2018-02-02 21:53:41 UTC <kagleslie> @SenatorShaheen @SenJoniErnst How are you protecting the women who accused the president of sexual misconduct?

959500246123413505 2018-02-02 18:54:19 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley If you are so concerned about transparency where are Trumps tax returns?  What about the Democratic rebuttal?  What about the WH visitor logs?
959413565152210944 2018-02-02 13:09:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You had a bipartisan agreement and you refused to sign it.  This is on you.  It has always been on you and the @GOP.
959412798961922050 2018-02-02 13:06:50 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If there were FISA warrents, there was probably cause.  Which means a judge agreed there was reason to believe something illegal was happening.  Don't you have any idea how warrants work? #MuellerIsComing
959412217635655680 2018-02-02 13:04:32 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @The_Trump_Train Okay.  If transparency is vital release the WH visitor logs, the MarALago guest lists, the Democratic rebuttal to this memo, Trump's tax returns, all of it.  You don't get to pick and choose.
959411339298000898 2018-02-02 13:01:02 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump What about those #Russiansanctions?
959411069163900928 2018-02-02 12:59:58 UTC <kagleslie> @70s_party Oh.  My.  God.
959239083598938112 2018-02-01 01:36:33 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Well, I guess I won't be going to Georgia any time soon.
959206833616547840 2018-02-01 23:28:24 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill No he didnt not wrongly claim anything. He lied. Tell it like it is. He lied.
959206597141651456 2018-02-01 23:27:28 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Sure. Release it. And the Democrats memo and Trumps tax returns and the White House visiting logs and the guest lists at Mar A Lago. All of it. Or none of it. But you dont get to say we need this for transparency if you wont release the others.

958192622308413445 2018-01-29 04:18:18 UTC <kagleslie> So, @realDonaldTrump why didn't you enforce the #RussianSanctions?  Today was the deadline.  I will wait for your explanation.

954763302499995656 2018-01-20 17:11:24 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Schumer didnt let CHIP expire and sign an executive order ending DACA. Huge didnt walk away from a bipartisan bill he promised to sign. This is a #TrumpShutdown and this is all on the @GOP.
954565323977568257 2018-01-19 04:04:42 UTC <kagleslie> @JoyAnnReid I'd say that's an accurate assessment.
954534326791819269 2018-01-19 02:01:32 UTC <kagleslie> @ysolda Surely there must be a yarn store nearby somewhere!  PANIC!  PANIC! and look for yarn!!!!
954522726525472769 2018-01-19 01:15:26 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Unlikely.  Plus, if you really are"prolife" and not just anti choice why won't you support medicaid for pregnant women without health insurance, nutrition programs etc?

954477560586522624 2018-01-19 22:15:58 UTC <kagleslie> @SpeakerRyan You could have reauthorized CHIP months ago. This is all on the @GOP no matter how you spin it. This is. #TrumpShutdown
954477275780734977 2018-01-19 22:14:50 UTC <kagleslie> @MEPFuller And so should we all.
954474917453598720 2018-01-19 22:05:28 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill That is because it is their fault.
954474825657016321 2018-01-19 22:05:06 UTC <kagleslie> @JohnCornyn @SenSchumer isnt president. He didnt back out of signing a bipartisan deal he said he would sign. That was @realDonaldTrump. And he didnt let CHIP expire, or write an executive order ending DACA. This is a #TrumpShutdown
954469339947773957 2018-01-19 21:43:18 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley But it was the @GOP that let CHIp expire in the first place. And a Republican in the White House who ended DACA for no good reason except hes racist. This is all on the @GOP. #TrumpShutdown
954342900577591296 2018-01-19 13:20:52 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile you go golfing.

954170332163837952 2018-01-18 01:55:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Best way I can think of to "make America great again" is for you to resign.
954170146876219392 2018-01-18 01:54:25 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If there is a shut down, this is all on you and the @GOP.  And we will be sure you pay for it in November.

954151445305221120 2018-01-18 00:40:06 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Were explaining how Iowans spend every darn penny on booze, women and movies?
953995505482326016 2018-01-18 14:20:27 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump That's not what you were saying before.  You also said Mexico would pay for it, and now you expect us to pay for it.  Were you lying before?  if the government shuts down it's on you and the @GOP.  #Shutdown
953994849115627521 2018-01-18 14:17:51 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No we don't need a wall.  You promised to sign an immigration agreement, and then you backed out.  This is your fault.  Liar. #Shutdown
953994623592083456 2018-01-18 14:16:57 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If there is a shutdown it's your fault for not signing the bipartisan DACA bill you promised you would sign.  Liar.
953994237670051841 2018-01-18 14:15:25 UTC <kagleslie> Let's be clear on this.  Congress gave @realDonaldTrump a bipartisan DACA agreement, that he promised he would sign, and then he refused to sign it.  IF there is a shutdown, this is on @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP.  I am so sick of this bullshit.  #Shutdown

953820829271445504 2018-01-17 02:46:21 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did you talk about spending every penny on booze, women and movies?  Did you explain why you tried to cover up the Fusion transcripts, and why you are trying to push through a bunch of judicial appointments before the Government shutdown?
953739969553666048 2018-01-17 21:25:03 UTC <kagleslie> @JoyAnnReid Yes. That is gross
953623504603185154 2018-01-17 13:42:15 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I don't think that's true.

953338125580951552 2018-01-16 18:48:15 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No. They gave you a bipartisan bill and you refused to sign it after you said you would. So this is on you as I have explained to you before. I blame the @GOP for this mess.
953337565045813248 2018-01-16 18:46:02 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If you want to stop the massive inflow of drugs talk to the pharmaceutical companies. And why do we need to pay for the wall?  You said Mexico was going to pay for it.
953309244413173760 2018-01-16 16:53:30 UTC <kagleslie> @70s_party Terrifying.
953032722792009730 2018-01-15 22:34:42 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You said you would sign a bipartisan bill. They gave you a bipartisan bill and you refused to sign it. This is your fault.
953010476094513152 2018-01-15 21:06:18 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill @puristology I dont think so.

952962872417628160 2018-01-15 17:57:08 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did anybody ask why you havent condemned Trumps racist comments?
952959606610976769 2018-01-15 17:44:10 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA I find it rather hypocritical that a person with a confederate flag on his desk is tweeting #MLK quotes.
952957055362568193 2018-01-15 17:34:01 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Its Martin Luther King Day. A good day to condemn this racist president.
952956809584762887 2018-01-15 17:33:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @Franklin_Graham @ralphfeaster @susankey_key Good point.
952898731933880322 2018-01-15 13:42:16 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump "Make America Great Again" does not mean Make America White Again.  America is great because of it's diversity.  You are a racist.
952898546453360645 2018-01-15 13:41:32 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Democrats presented a bipartisan DACA bill, as you well know.  And you refused to sign it, after saying that you would.  You are a liar and a racist.
952897287981760512 2018-01-15 13:36:32 UTC <kagleslie> @SenJoniErnst So, maybe today is a good day for you to condemn @realDonaldTrump's racist comments?
952896451243380736 2018-01-15 13:33:12 UTC <kagleslie> @krassenstein Me too.

952676950958583810 2018-01-14 23:00:59 UTC <kagleslie> @nycjayjay That's funny.
952676761510318080 2018-01-14 23:00:14 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill But the president IS a racist.  Why shouldn't we call him one?
952676611987566598 2018-01-14 22:59:38 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Do you think Haiti, African countries and El Salvador are "shitholes" like 45 does?
952676423445164032 2018-01-14 22:58:53 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA But what happens to that child once it's born?  Or the mother?  You don't give a damn what happens to that baby after 40 weeks gestation.
952558019908395008 2018-01-14 15:08:24 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump They gave you a bipartisan proposal, and you refused to sign it.  You said you would and then you backed out.  This is on you.
952557724470009856 2018-01-14 15:07:13 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, explain to me how your mother, your paternal grandfather and your wife would have fared under this proposed system.
952354882966687749 2018-01-13 01:41:12 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill I notice he didn't really answer them though.
952354614040461312 2018-01-13 01:40:08 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill I can't help but wonder if Donald Trump is aware that Africa is a continent, not a country.  I bet he didn't even know there were 55 countries in Africa.
952304355029463040 2018-01-13 22:20:25 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Racist
952258178716262401 2018-01-13 19:16:56 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did you talk about Trump and Steve Kings racist comments?
952205897316651008 2018-01-13 15:49:11 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley What are your thoughts on the President referring to Haiti, El Salvador and other non-white countries as "sh*tholes"?
952205312886525953 2018-01-13 15:46:52 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump America First does not mean white people only America First does not mean collude with Russia to steal elections America First does not mean neo-nazis are "very fine people" You are an embarrassment.   #BlueWave2018 #MuellerIsComing
952204488131137536 2018-01-13 15:43:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, people are being laid off at AT&T, Carrier, Macy's, Nordstroms, Sears, Sam's Club...I could go on.
952204265417789445 2018-01-13 15:42:42 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Once again, a bipartisan plan was given to you and you rejected it.  This is all on you now.
952204084815253511 2018-01-13 15:41:59 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump They gave you a bipartisan plan and you refused to sign it.  This is on you.

951926894399717377 2018-01-12 21:20:32 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did they ask what you think of the president referring to other countries as shitholes?  Did they ask why you obstructed justice by withholding the Fusion transcript?

951856754777784320 2018-01-12 16:41:49 UTC <kagleslie> Dear everyone else  in the world. I am sorry for Trumps words and attitude. He does not speak for me. And he does not speak for many other Americans.
951856172990189569 2018-01-12 16:39:30 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I dont believe you. And I dont believe you will record meetings because those recordings will prove your hateful racist attitude.
951855729434071040 2018-01-12 16:37:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If there is a shutdown it is all on you. You said you would sign a bipartisan DACA agreement and then refused to do it.
951812793245814784 2018-01-12 13:47:08 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If you want to "make America great again" resign.
951812654275973121 2018-01-12 13:46:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You said you would sign it and then you refused to sign it.  More lies.
951812487409782784 2018-01-12 13:45:55 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I don't think you would be very welcome in London right now anyway.  So I am guessing this is just your excuse.

951221061823205376 2018-01-10 22:35:48 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill @BradParrTX Honestly I would prefer handcuffs.
951202181771923457 2018-01-10 21:20:47 UTC <kagleslie> @SenBobCorker Is he qualified?  Or is this another desperate attempt by the GOP to fill the judiciary with conservative judges no matter how unqualified they are?
951201738924724224 2018-01-10 21:19:01 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did you explain why you voted to take healthcare away from Iowans?  #ResignGrassley
951201277903540224 2018-01-10 21:17:11 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Why did you try to suppress the Fusion testimony?  What are you hiding?  #ResignGrassley
951178648178057216 2018-01-10 19:47:16 UTC <kagleslie> @sandiegozoo Spot
951178268476166146 2018-01-10 19:45:45 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill Well we all know how thats going to go.  I doubt he can get 5 minutes into his testimony without committing perjury.
951176599084421120 2018-01-10 19:39:07 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump have you seen this!https://twitter.com/thehill/status/951166274083663874

951174787417690112 2018-01-10 19:31:55 UTC <kagleslie> @PeaceCorps @SenBobCorker No parent should have to endure the loss of their child due to inadequate health care.  Thats a quote from the article. If you really believe hat why did you vote for this #TaxScamBill?
951137862363303936 2018-01-10 17:05:12 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 May I recommend Iowa?  But maybe wait until spring.
951137452047167489 2018-01-10 17:03:34 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill @ChuckGrassley is just mad because she made him look like the corrupt fool he is.
951136955139575809 2018-01-10 17:01:36 UTC <kagleslie> @SenGaryPeters @SenatorCollins How about renewing CHIP?
951136617993039873 2018-01-10 17:00:15 UTC <kagleslie> @nrlc @SteveKingIA Because its a terrible bill that will hurt women.
951089048747216898 2018-01-10 13:51:14 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 @Praiirie_Lights Bookstore in Iowa City, Iowa.  It's a beautiful shop with a great selection, and events!  I stop in every time I'm in that town.
950919601659006977 2018-01-09 02:37:54 UTC <kagleslie> @BeaglesResist Thanks!
950888818286256128 2018-01-09 00:35:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump But you promised Mexico was going to pay for the wall. So why are you asking for $18 billion in funding?  Were you lying about who would pay for it?
950876689759920128 2018-01-09 23:47:23 UTC <kagleslie> @BeaglesResist What are you reading?
950867712439390208 2018-01-09 23:11:43 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Why did you try to obstruct justice to withholding the Fusion transcripts?  You should #ResignGrassley.
950866776216276997 2018-01-09 23:08:00 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 Except Nigel Farage is a fuckturnip.
950813513936760834 2018-01-09 19:36:21 UTC <kagleslie> Thank you @SenFeinstein for releasing the Fusion transcripts that @ChuckGrassley has been keeping away from the public.
950812806944878592 2018-01-09 19:33:33 UTC <kagleslie> @WMTWTV @SenatorShaheen @SenatorCollins Until, of course, Medicare gets wiped out to pay for the #GOPTaxScam you voted for.
950778921213186050 2018-01-09 17:18:54 UTC <kagleslie> @krassenstein So am I
950778749385150466 2018-01-09 17:18:13 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill I dont think either one of them is qualified.
950778097955155968 2018-01-09 17:15:37 UTC <kagleslie> @GOPLeader @nrlc @SteveKingIA Maybe because its a terrible bill?
950584817283977218 2018-01-08 04:27:36 UTC <kagleslie> @Oprah @IvankaTrump Maybe you should talk to your dad about that.
950584215711764481 2018-01-08 04:25:12 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill No!  No!  No!  Can we please have a candidate who is actually qualified to be President.  Haven't we learned out lesson about electing celebrities with no political experience?
950580481271259138 2018-01-08 04:10:22 UTC <kagleslie> @SincereSnwflake Somehow I doubt it.  Especially since he seems pretty fuzzy on this whole Constitution thing.

950539786426683398 2018-01-08 01:28:39 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Um, where are you getting that statistic?  And what about the very premature babies that need months in the NICU and sometimes have profound health problems all their lives and need healthcare you don't want to fund?  #TIMESUP
950539347497021441 2018-01-08 01:26:55 UTC <kagleslie> I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure I heard at least some of the crowd booing @realDonaldTrump before the Georgia/Alabama game.
950476884789399552 2018-01-08 21:18:42 UTC <kagleslie> @mommy_nap @NatashaBertrand Well this is interesting.
950476283984609280 2018-01-08 21:16:19 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill That is a relief. Hang on Justice Ginsberg. We need you.
950476054493265920 2018-01-08 21:15:25 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did you explain to him why you havent released the Fusion transcripts. And why you are obstructing justice?
950365195532230656 2018-01-08 13:54:54 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill @rbmarchi40 Waiting to get my copy from the library.
950364812021813249 2018-01-08 13:53:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I see you fixed your mistake.  Doesn't make this any more true.

950190241738121221 2018-01-07 02:19:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @dshardy Oh please no.  I can't imagine how much worse things would be if he actually did his job.
950130266726715397 2018-01-07 22:21:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Ronald Reagan also had Alzheimer's disease.  Do you??
950130024190967808 2018-01-07 22:20:24 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This is very childish, and beneath the office of the president.
950129863956029440 2018-01-07 22:19:46 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You do know that less than half of all Americans own stock, right?  And what about the way the dollar is falling against foreign currencies?  The stock market is not the only way to measure the health of the economy.
950055815158910977 2018-01-07 17:25:32 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill At least you had good health insurance. Most of us arent that lucky.

949426126623043591 2018-01-05 23:43:22 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill What could possibly go wrong?  (She said sarcastically)

949142728184512519 2018-01-04 04:57:15 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Why does the US need to find the wall?  You said Mexico was going to pay for it.
949063496007864320 2018-01-04 23:42:24 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Thanks Obama
949063312322461696 2018-01-04 23:41:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump More important to push for more secure voting to avoid foreign interference in our elections.
949061426727055361 2018-01-04 23:34:11 UTC <kagleslie> @SenatorCardin @SenBobCorker So how do you feel about NFL players peacefully protesting by taking a knee?  Or do you only support protests in other countries?

949010514809643014 2018-01-04 20:11:53 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did you tell them why you are obstructing justice by not releasing the Fusion transcripts?
949010348140630017 2018-01-04 20:11:13 UTC <kagleslie> @krassenstein That is a great idea.
948979329819652096 2018-01-04 18:07:58 UTC <kagleslie> @krassenstein They skipped the first amendment and went right to the second.
948979217634643969 2018-01-04 18:07:31 UTC <kagleslie> @HillaryClinton @HenryHolt @krassenstein I would buy that 10 times.

948917729448353792 2018-01-04 14:03:11 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The NFL players have a first amendment right to protest protected by the military.  Maybe you should think about that the next time you are golfing and planting trees so the free press can't see you.  Trying to hide your golf habit, or your crummy swing?
948916808979017728 2018-01-04 13:59:31 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @AlphaAndreas @DaveTho86176055 I have pre-existing conditions and without the ACA I would never have been able to change jobs.  So the ACA is working great thanks.

947491346662809601 2017-12-31 15:35:15 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Why are you still so obsessed with @HillaryClinton?  Is it because you know she was the real winner last November, and you stole the Presidency out from under her?
947491162205687819 2017-12-31 15:34:31 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Why would smart voters ever vote for the @GOP?   G.reed O.ver P.eople #FlipTheHouse

947107373503655936 2017-12-30 14:09:28 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA @alstockwell1 That deficit increase included the economic stimulus package needed to clean up George W. Bush's mess.  This deficit increase is strictly to line the pockets of the GOP's donors.
946955335855636480 2017-12-29 04:05:20 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The Rasmussen poll generally polls republicans.  Which means, less than half of your own party approve of you.  I'll let you think about that for a minute.
946954738083467264 2017-12-29 04:02:57 UTC <kagleslie> @CBS @realDonaldTrump @charliekirk11 Maybe, until those tax cuts expire.  And when the health insurance market destabilizes thanks to the GOP repealing the individual mandate, her health insurance will go up and that tax cut won't even cover one visit to the ER.

946882709053468673 2017-12-29 23:16:44 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA And add another 1.4 trillion dollars to the deficit. Dont you dare complain about the national debt ever again. And I wonder how those employees will feel when their tax cut expires.
946836370131243014 2017-12-29 20:12:36 UTC <kagleslie> @joncoopertweets Accurate. He doesnt care about anybody but himself n
946835873051693057 2017-12-29 20:10:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I thought Mexico was paying for the wall. So why would you be holding out on DACA for money to pay for a wall Mexico is paying for?

943705130175746048 2017-12-20 04:50:10 UTC <kagleslie> I believe it was called the Women's March.  But it wasn't so much for him as a protest against him.

943547849463287808 2017-12-20 18:25:12 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Why did you vote to explode the deficit. You never get to use that as excuse again. And hands off my social security and Medicare/Medicaid. And renew CHIP. Dont you dare say you cant afford it. #taxscam
943468915878957057 2017-12-20 13:11:33 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This is a blatant cash grab by you and your wealthy cronies at our expense.  Shame on you.  We will remember this, and so will you when we #FlipItBlue in 2018.   #TaxScam

941296654086557696 2017-12-14 13:19:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump There should not be a vote until the people of Alabama can have their voice heard.  Doug Jones needs to be seated before the vote.
941036758355120128 2017-12-13 20:07:01 UTC <kagleslie> @kylegriffin1 Hes right of course. But that wont stop McConnell from pushing I through.

940952622059675648 2017-12-13 14:32:41 UTC <kagleslie> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I can think of two stories the Mainstream media retracted and apologized for it.  The rest of it is true.  Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it's fake news.
940926170463383553 2017-12-13 12:47:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump ...and here's the tweet he really wrote.  So.  Much. Winning.  Right Donald?

933320715343925253 2017-11-22 13:06:13 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump About Roy Moore, a pedophile is better than a Democrat?  I guess since you are an admitted sexual predator that makes sense.
933320239135248385 2017-11-22 13:04:19 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So how much are we paying for you to be at Mar-A-Lago?  Assume you will have to step up your visits since so many big fundraisers have cancelled there.

932050101832470530 2017-11-18 00:57:15 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Why did you vote for a tax bill that cuts Medicaid and Medicare funding to give the super wealthy a tax cut?
932049592111321093 2017-11-18 00:55:14 UTC <kagleslie> @knittaphd Pretty. I love making toe up socks but Im not crazy about magic loop. Im happier with my good old double points.
931897512855826432 2017-11-18 14:50:55 UTC <kagleslie> Something is bothering me. If #LeannTweeden felt violated by @SenFranken kissing her, she was violated.  Victim shaming just because she has been on Fox and Friends is not okay.

926507472327725057 2017-11-03 17:52:49 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA This is a power play against women and it wont work. Renew CHIP. Step up funding for prenatal care education and nutrition.

926470381719912453 2017-11-03 15:25:26 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So when will we see you enacting gun laws to protect us from white crazy men who shoot at hundreds of people?

926248442225098754 2017-11-02 00:43:32 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So when will you be talking about gun legislation?  Has it been long enough since the Las Vegas tragedy or is it still too soon?

926246532315217920 2017-11-02 00:35:56 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley When will you renew CHIP?  Who do you think will get indicted yet?  When will you put the country ahead of the party?
926156654781050881 2017-11-02 18:38:48 UTC <kagleslie> @UnfollowTrump Too bad they have to go to the White House now.

926066164475879425 2017-11-02 12:39:13 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump And James Alex Fields Jr. should get the death penalty too right?
926066017780097024 2017-11-02 12:38:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Maybe you should wait until after the trial before you start talking about sentencing.
926065932484661248 2017-11-02 12:38:18 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, i assume James Alex Fields should also get the death penalty?  Or does this not apply to him because he is white?

925773739316469760 2017-11-01 17:17:14 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Wouldnt it be great if we had single payer health care for everyone and nobody had to start a fundraiser to pay for chemo?

925348926705819648 2017-10-31 13:09:10 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Tax cuts for business and the billionaires will do nothing for the middle class.    If you were innocent you wouldn't be protesting so much.
925348151355158528 2017-10-31 13:06:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Those were some very real indictments and a very real guilty plea coming out of the so called fake news.
925347854398509061 2017-10-31 13:04:55 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The indictment says "through 2017".  That's this year.  So did you knowingly hire a felon?  That makes you complicit.  Or just stupid?
925347467708813312 2017-10-31 13:03:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Yelling there was no collusion does not make it true.

925346059974529026 2017-10-31 12:57:47 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Who do you think will be the next one indicted?  When are you going to start working for Iowans and not for yourself and 45?
925117147323551744 2017-10-30 21:48:10 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Any comment on todays indictments?

925060487578087431 2017-10-30 18:03:01 UTC <kagleslie> @AP Good. This day keeps getting better and better.
925030179407388673 2017-10-30 16:02:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Panicking much?  Did you know you had hired a felon?  You are either complicit or a fool. Or both I suppose.

924019345671499776 2017-10-27 21:05:54 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley How about renewing CHIP first and then lecture the History Channel.
923953551189082113 2017-10-27 16:44:27 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Um no.
923604142442123266 2017-10-26 17:36:01 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did you explain why you havent renewed CHIP?  Or why Russian sanctions are not being enacted?
923535522391298050 2017-10-26 13:03:21 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA GOP initiated dossier, then the Dems picked it up.  Just saying.
923385502874701825 2017-10-25 03:07:14 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen I hope so
923385400944726016 2017-10-25 03:06:49 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Thank you Congress for approving this in 1992. This has nothing to do with 45.
923385216777031680 2017-10-25 03:06:06 UTC <kagleslie> @DanPatrick @GovAbbott @realDonaldTrump How are things going in Puerto Rico?
923384856456949762 2017-10-25 03:04:40 UTC <kagleslie> @VP Shame on you for letting big banks screw the little guy once again
923384484837412864 2017-10-25 03:03:11 UTC <kagleslie> @VP Im going to assume that includes all faiths, not just Christianity, right?
923380578652708866 2017-10-25 02:47:40 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA First the termination was privately funded. Second, abortion is a legal medical procedure and they had no right to stop her. Justice won.
923379978066169856 2017-10-25 02:45:16 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Why did you side with big banks instead of the people of Iowa?  How does this help us?

923369585839091712 2017-10-25 02:03:59 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley How did they feel about the huge cuts to Medicare?
923369418675118080 2017-10-25 02:03:19 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Whenever Trump supporters cant defend him they bring up either the Clintons or Obama. Grow up.
923274559809310720 2017-10-25 19:46:23 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Distract and deflect. When will the government start enforcing sanctions against Russia?  You should have more respect for your constituents
923273948695064577 2017-10-25 19:43:57 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley This plan will steal money from Medicare and Medicaid to give tax cuts to your corporate friends. Say no. Make them pay their fair share.
923009670867853312 2017-10-24 02:13:48 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley why don't you concentrate on the Russia investigation first?  That seems more important to me.
922994215734403072 2017-10-24 01:12:24 UTC <kagleslie> #HR4HR
922976943791923202 2017-10-24 00:03:46 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Dont you have work to do?  Renew CHIP.
922806235296038912 2017-10-24 12:45:26 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Perhaps Senator Corker doesn't want to be complicit in your sham government anymore.
922805967540097029 2017-10-24 12:44:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are lying.  Again.  Or still.  I'm not sure.   Sen. Bob Corker: Congress should reject the bad Iran dealhttp://wapo.st/1flwXST?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.8ab09625ae74

922637564779159552 2017-10-23 01:35:11 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Health Care. Health Care. Health Care. The GOP is stealing from Medicaid and Medicare to give tax cuts to the wealthy.  Do something.
922588499617857536 2017-10-23 22:20:13 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley CHIP, Puerto Rico, and please explain why the government is cutting Medicare and Medicaid.
922588228594450432 2017-10-23 22:19:09 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA I cant wait to vote you out of office. You are a bigot and dont represent me.
922529714987773952 2017-10-23 18:26:38 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Why does this tax plan cut Medicare and Medicaid?  What about the Russian sanctions?  What about CHIP?  Get to work.
922158035501535233 2017-10-22 17:49:43 UTC <kagleslie> @kschwarb12 Thank you and the entire team for an amazing season.
922094831500972034 2017-10-22 13:38:34 UTC <kagleslie> @SethAbramson Grassley needs to go.  So does Ernst.  So do most IA legislators.  That is all.  Carry on.
922076464941543424 2017-10-22 12:25:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Stop it.
922076112628445184 2017-10-22 12:24:11 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Strong black women terrify you dont they?
921738979833270273 2017-10-21 14:04:32 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump First of all name calling is beneath the Office of the President. Second you need to let this go. Respect the family involved and shut up.
921579056197459968 2017-10-20 03:29:03 UTC <kagleslie> @olivialeslie98 Its true.
921562360636149760 2017-10-20 02:22:43 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley You have so much work to do.  Go do it.
921089196999233539 2017-10-19 19:02:32 UTC <kagleslie> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Fox and Friends is not a reliable source.  You are the POTUS.  It is irresponsible to spread conspiracy theories.
921088942589521920 2017-10-19 19:01:31 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @804StreetMedia @USArmy333 Muslim ban #1 - failed Muslim ban #2 - failed Muslim ban #3 - failed Repeal and Replace - failed So.  Much.  Winning.
921087578828402688 2017-10-19 18:56:06 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA These NFL players are doing more for the US than you ever will.  This country was founded on protest, remember?
921086959015071745 2017-10-19 18:53:38 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Why does the new tax plan cut funding for Medicare and Medicaid?  When will you renew CHIP?  And quit stalling the Russia investigation.
920984991072481281 2017-10-19 12:08:27 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump And how are you going to pay for those tax cuts for you and your billionaire friends?
920984691280359424 2017-10-19 12:07:16 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You know, the minute you call something fake, i instantly am 100% convinced it's the real deal.  You sound like you are getting nervous.
920984350690332673 2017-10-19 12:05:54 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I think the biggest news story is how you colluded with Russia to steal the election.
920857167669972993 2017-10-18 03:40:32 UTC <kagleslie> @NFL @realDonaldTrump I'll just leave this here. Sooner or later maybe you will actually read it.pic.twitter.com/QLrlNpWVQS
920856310568181760 2017-10-18 03:37:07 UTC <kagleslie> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You're right, on Fox News it IS much worse.
920854884458655744 2017-10-18 03:31:27 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Can't list it all in 144 characters.
920797342596395009 2017-10-18 23:42:48 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley Same party that wants to eliminate health care for millions. Reducing medicaid will kick people out of nursing homes. You know that, right?
920796805792538624 2017-10-18 23:40:40 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA I'm pretty sure people can just wade around the end of that fence.  Don't waste my tax money on this garbage.
920663380146442240 2017-10-18 14:50:29 UTC <kagleslie> @BFriedmanDC Very well said. Thank you.
920641066528751616 2017-10-18 13:21:49 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Would you shut up about Secretary Clinton?  I suspect Mueller is starting to make you very very nervous.
920640202472747008 2017-10-18 13:18:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Wrong!  Great respect for the First Amendment and our country.  This country was founded on protest.
920639523339436032 2017-10-18 13:15:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Okay, if you have proof, let's see it.  The world is waiting.
920500690300162048 2017-10-17 04:04:01 UTC <kagleslie> @CNN @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump No, just because you don't like something doesn't make it false.
920500142960242694 2017-10-17 04:01:50 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No, your fault for sabotaging the ACA.  This is all on you and no amount of finger pointing will change that.
920499172771581957 2017-10-17 03:57:59 UTC <kagleslie> @ellisonbarber Heartbreaking.

920452759886888960 2017-10-17 00:53:33 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley How about you renew CHIP? And then if you must give out tax cuts make sure they actually go to the working class.  Not your billionaire pals
920382133952229379 2017-10-17 20:12:55 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA There are a million better ways to spend this money
920343735975710726 2017-10-17 17:40:20 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 Im sorry. Our border guards are generally rude and awful in my experience. And I LIVE here.
920342626490109952 2017-10-17 17:35:55 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA You do realize this is the very reason a wall wont work, right?
920322569370206209 2017-10-17 16:16:13 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Oh for f**k sake
920256245759692805 2017-10-17 11:52:41 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA You don't give a damn what happens to that baby once it's born.  You are not pro life you are anti choice.
920256118261272576 2017-10-17 11:52:10 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA If you were really pro life you would support planned parenthood, prenatal care and CHIP.
920255513560014848 2017-10-17 11:49:46 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA We don't need a wall.  We need to renew CHIP, help #PuertoRico, craft common sense gun laws and stop 45 from stealing our health care.
919895871063552000 2017-10-16 12:00:41 UTC <kagleslie> Don't hear much about executive overreach now do you?https://twitter.com/commondefense/status/919877267068682246
919894680472637440 2017-10-16 11:55:57 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Don't you have better things to do?  I have great respect for Colin Kaepernick.  I have zero respect for you.

919208974439895040 2017-10-14 14:31:12 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei disgusting.
919208820567691264 2017-10-14 14:30:35 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Maybe you should be more concerned with our corrupt president than the Clintons, who are currently private citizens.
919208561749749761 2017-10-14 14:29:33 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Don't believe everything you read on fox news
919208376604774401 2017-10-14 14:28:49 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Gun Control, CHIP, Heath Care has just been stolen from millions, CA on fire #PuertoRico desperate, get your priorities straight sir.
919208173508153345 2017-10-14 14:28:01 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA You really shouldn't believe anything you read on Breitbart.  Just saying...
919207952141217792 2017-10-14 14:27:08 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley CHIP has expired. POTUS just dismantled the ACA (executive overreach?) #PuertoRico in dire need CA is on fire and you are tweeting scores?

918603121445744646 2017-10-12 22:23:45 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Well the difference is the Democrats didnt look the other way and elect him President of the United States.
918436681145094146 2017-10-12 11:22:23 UTC <kagleslie> @seanhannity @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You have work to do.  Stop promoting fox "news"
918436500785725441 2017-10-12 11:21:40 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How about we keep them there until you actually get things fixed?  Once power is restored and the roads are clear and they have clean water.
918264293606469632 2017-10-11 23:57:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump what are you going to do about this?https://twitter.com/chelseaclinton/status/918252048868610049
918173799455043584 2017-10-11 17:57:47 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Are you trying to win or govern?  Maybe if 3 GOP say no its not a good bill. Think about the people who vote for you. Not a scorecard.

918092086238380033 2017-10-11 12:33:05 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How does a tax cut for your billionaire pals help the middle class like you promised? How will you pay for this wall you want AND tax cuts?
918091647635853312 2017-10-11 12:31:20 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump It would be very nice if you would waive the Jones act and help #PuertoRico.  It would be very nice if you would introduce #GunContolNow
918091288792260609 2017-10-11 12:29:55 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You can't have both a wall and tax cuts.  So which is it?
918091086005927936 2017-10-11 12:29:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Northern CA is on fire.  12 people are dead.  4 American soldiers dead in Niger, #PuertoRico is 85% without power.  SHUT UP ABOUT THE NFL
918090483640995841 2017-10-11 12:26:43 UTC <kagleslie> @YarnHarlot You can do it.  I have faith in you.
917928512606138368 2017-10-10 01:43:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Don't you have anything better to do?  And have you actually read this book?

917808662965555200 2017-10-10 17:46:51 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley President Trump is going to lead us straight into WW 3. He is unfit to lead. Please. Impeach him before he gets us all killed.

917457222824792065 2017-10-09 18:30:22 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley When will you stand up to the NRA and introduce common senssense gun laws?  You have blood on your hands.
917456847933722624 2017-10-09 18:28:52 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA I really cant wait to vote you out of office.
917223735949758464 2017-10-08 03:02:34 UTC <kagleslie> @POTUS @VP #PuertoRico is in terrible trouble. 58 Americans die in Las Vegas, and you use the flag and anthem as a prop in a photo up.  Disgusting.

915928254242017280 2017-10-05 13:14:47 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How about we stop this from happening again? Introduce #GunControlNow. That is the best way to recognize the dead and the first responders.
915927541994618882 2017-10-05 13:11:57 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This is whypic.twitter.com/qRNC1RfsSV

915769026093174785 2017-10-04 02:42:04 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley How about some common senses gun laws?  How about renewing CHIP?
915678798292582401 2017-10-04 20:43:32 UTC <kagleslie> Why is #NationalTacoDay not on a Tuesday?
915676606076768256 2017-10-04 20:34:49 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA How is it that an arsenal of automatic weapons is a right, but healthcare for the victims of those guns is a privilege?
915647646655746048 2017-10-04 18:39:45 UTC <kagleslie> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Keep your thoughts and prayers. Introduce some common sense gun legislation so this doesn't happen again
915619783395115010 2017-10-04 16:49:02 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley How about we don't do business with them at all. How about we work on healthcare and gun legislation instead?
915566106185801730 2017-10-04 13:15:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump What is great about touring an island that has been devastated and talking to people who have lost everything? Do you have any compassion?
915565866594574336 2017-10-04 13:14:47 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I think you are the one that is out of control.  You need to stop undermining our media.  You are an embarrassment.
915565045957976064 2017-10-04 13:11:31 UTC <kagleslie> @Lin_Manuel Ouch!
915564814444978176 2017-10-04 13:10:36 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley We need #Healthcare  we need to renew CHIP.  We need common sense gun control.  We need you to do your job.
915564580855828480 2017-10-04 13:09:41 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley How about we offer the same protections to people after they are born that you seem bent on providing after 20 weeks gestation?
915389712155729920 2017-10-03 01:34:49 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump I like how the "play" button is right on his face.  Hah!
915389513421213696 2017-10-03 01:34:01 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Renew funding for CHIP, do something about gun control and stop taking the NRA's blood money.
915389250199343104 2017-10-03 01:32:59 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Until 40 weeks right?  Once that baby is born you don't seem terribly concerned with what happens to it.
915315894900936704 2017-10-03 20:41:29 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley How about renewing CHIP?  Or are you ok with taking health insurance away from millions of kids?
915200695556591616 2017-10-03 13:03:44 UTC <kagleslie> Watched @Morning_Joe sign off this morning with the words "the greatest act of resistance is kindness". It's a good plan. #Resist
915025732174336000 2017-10-02 01:28:29 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley @joniernst  stop taking NRA money and DO SOMETHING TO stop this from happening again.https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/915004999712727040

915009054497484800 2017-10-02 00:22:13 UTC <kagleslie> @Lin_Manuel @AvocatPerdu Thank you for donating blood.
915008607057596416 2017-10-02 00:20:26 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Hearts and prayers don't cut it.  Introduce legislation to keep these weapons off our streets.  Stand up to the NRA and do the right thing.
914943802674204672 2017-10-02 20:02:56 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Condolences don't cut it. Introduce legislation to get these guns off our streets. No civilian needs weapons like those used last night
914893062689652736 2017-10-02 16:41:18 UTC <kagleslie> @joniernst We don't need prayers. We need to DO SOMETHING to ban automatic weapons for civilians.
914879341925986304 2017-10-02 15:46:47 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley We need gun control. Stop praying and DO SOMETHING.
914852617712472064 2017-10-02 14:00:35 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump I just had the exact same thought.
914837374173138944 2017-10-02 13:00:01 UTC <kagleslie> somebody please explain to me again how more guns make us safer?  #GunControlNow
914836233800622081 2017-10-02 12:55:29 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @BreakingDTrump This was a white domestic terrorist from Mesquite Nevada.  This is terrorism.  Say it.

914602437532581889 2017-10-01 21:26:28 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Um, Kim Jong Un has only been in power since 2011.  2017-2011=6 not 25.  I think you are talking about Kim Jong Il.
914477298388226048 2017-10-01 13:09:12 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump He lost though didn't he?
914477084092887040 2017-10-01 13:08:21 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Ingrates?  Ingrates?  Seriously?  Would you shut up and do your damn job instead of golfing.  SMH
914329970033471489 2017-09-30 03:23:46 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No you are not.
914329857932357632 2017-09-30 03:23:20 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Stop it. Focus on what's important. Like people dying in Puerto Rico because you won't help them
914329626964631552 2017-09-30 03:22:25 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Stop this nonsense and do your damn job.
914329200412303361 2017-09-30 03:20:43 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Please do the right thing and get help to Puerto Rico. And please denounce 45's childish twitter tantrum.
914328480497721349 2017-09-30 03:17:51 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Nothing but gratitude and respect for the FR on the ground in PR. But they need more help. Stop this nonsense and help them.
914240148564578304 2017-09-30 21:26:51 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Seems a little late for this. You've already revealed your true colors. You should be ashamed
914136416061452288 2017-09-30 14:34:40 UTC <kagleslie> I couldn't have said it better myself.  #HelpPuertoRicohttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/914103608119037952
914136250847723520 2017-09-30 14:34:00 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump  read this when you take a break from golfing.https://twitter.com/MatthiasBe/status/914106132561629184
914131444921962496 2017-09-30 14:14:54 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The fact that you continue to cry fake news must mean they are hitting the mark.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
914131134233153536 2017-09-30 14:13:40 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Nothing but respect and gratitude for the first responders. But your response has been pathetic.
914130948324814848 2017-09-30 14:12:56 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The First Responders are doing an amazing job and I thank them from the bottom of my heart.  But they need help.  Send help.
914130735128293377 2017-09-30 14:12:05 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So you attack the people of Puerto Rico while you are golfing.  They need help.  They have NOTHING. HELP them.
914130422216429568 2017-09-30 14:10:51 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You're joking, right?  She has been working 24/7 for over a week while you are GOLFING.  Shame on you.  You are the poor leader here.
913987411226525696 2017-09-29 04:42:34 UTC <kagleslie> @nachotheween @dog_rates I am so very in love with these dogs.
913986898854600704 2017-09-29 04:40:32 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Ok. So now let's talk about Puerto Rico and the USVI.
913965081871962113 2017-09-29 03:13:50 UTC <kagleslie> @seanhannity @EricTrump @FoxNews Surely you have better things to do than advertise for Fox News.
913964909796429825 2017-09-29 03:13:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @Scavino45 took you long enough
913964695622692866 2017-09-29 03:12:18 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_feelings You are. irreplaceable.
913964185733730304 2017-09-29 03:10:17 UTC <kagleslie> @AC360 If 45 calls someone a good man, it is probably the kiss of death.
913963874478624768 2017-09-29 03:09:02 UTC <kagleslie> @BarackObama Mr. President, thank you for continuing to lead by example.  Now, please do what you can to help the people of Puerto Rico and the USVI.
913927659230547968 2017-09-29 00:45:08 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump  maybe you could stop golfing long enough to watch this.https://twitter.com/AC360/status/913926250363805699
913876622276796416 2017-09-29 21:22:20 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Oh for fuck sake
913876539170869254 2017-09-29 21:22:00 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley We should be sending troops to help people in Puerto Rico and the USVI.
913753623947038720 2017-09-29 13:13:35 UTC <kagleslie> @GOPChairwoman @TheTweetwit Probably the Donald Trump legal defense fund.
913753540266532865 2017-09-29 13:13:15 UTC <kagleslie> @GOPChairwoman I'm going to need to see the cancelled checks.  And what is happening with the rest of the money?
913753398981353472 2017-09-29 13:12:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump What decisions?  Help them now, help them rebuild.  These are AMERICAN CITIZENS!  They need our help.  Now do it.
913753190864003073 2017-09-29 13:11:52 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Still the last fiscal year of Obama's administration.  #ThanksObama Nice try though.  Now, let's talk about helping Puerto Rico.
913570827764891648 2017-09-28 01:07:13 UTC <kagleslie> @commondefense Yep.
913569654819426304 2017-09-28 01:02:33 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @BreakingDTrump @impeach_d_trump And they are not white.
913569515799285760 2017-09-28 01:02:00 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Large numbers of generators and no gasoline.  So how is that helpful?
913569337847566336 2017-09-28 01:01:18 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Shut up and do your job.  Help the people in Puerto Rico and stop whining.
913569033060077570 2017-09-28 01:00:05 UTC <kagleslie> @IvankaTrump Too bad your dad isn't doing anything to help.
913568626225111040 2017-09-28 00:58:28 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump That's not what I've been hearing.  People are DYING!  We need to waive the Jones Act for longer than 10 days.  Help them.
913567693181243393 2017-09-28 00:54:45 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 I like Notes on a Nervous Planet

913220782142181376 2017-09-27 01:56:15 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Sorry to interrupt but people are dying in Puerto Rico.  Waive the Jones Act NOW and help these American citizens.
913220373507919872 2017-09-27 01:54:38 UTC <kagleslie> ...and the #chicagocubs  are the National League Central Champions.
913025108784140288 2017-09-27 12:58:43 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump People in Puerto Rico are dying.  DO SOMETHING!  Waive the Jones Act immediately.

912867373526454272 2017-09-26 02:31:56 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 All excellent ideas.  #4 is my favorite.
912846021364977664 2017-09-26 01:07:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Last month?  What took you so long?
912845034696970245 2017-09-26 01:03:10 UTC <kagleslie> @ChelseaClinton Happy birthday Charlotte!  I hope she had a wonderful day.

912668104278315008 2017-09-26 13:20:07 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, are you going to lock up Jared and Ivanka for using a private email server, like you threatened to lock up Secretary Clinton?
912499515919405056 2017-09-25 02:10:12 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Except of course for those confederate flags you always see in the stands of course.
912499424504483840 2017-09-25 02:09:50 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So booing during the Anthem is okay but taking a knee is not?  Pathetic.
912499277880004608 2017-09-25 02:09:15 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How about them Cowboys? #TakeAKneeNFL
912498952003624960 2017-09-25 02:07:58 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump And why not mention whatever debts FL and TX have?  Is this an attack on Puerto Rico?  These are American citizens and they need our help.
912498770570612739 2017-09-25 02:07:14 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump "and doing well"? That's not what I am hearing.  When are you going to Puerto Rico?
912498131664850945 2017-09-25 02:04:42 UTC <kagleslie> @Lin_Manuel Have fun.
912444356002447360 2017-09-25 22:31:01 UTC <kagleslie> Thank you @SenatorCollins for doing the right thing and saying you will vote no on #GrahamCasiddy
912426621768011776 2017-09-25 21:20:33 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Where is federal aid for Puerto Rico?
912426290950672385 2017-09-25 21:19:14 UTC <kagleslie> Hey @BarackObama why don't you invite the #goldenstatewarriors to dinner. I bet they would love to meet with you and your family.
912385295005437958 2017-09-25 18:36:20 UTC <kagleslie> @idinamenzel Congratulations!  I hope you have many happy years together.
912356728372649985 2017-09-25 16:42:49 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Since when is equality a partisan issue?
912299993054277634 2017-09-25 12:57:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, when are you going to Puerto Rico?  Don't you have better things to do than watch football?
912299298284539904 2017-09-25 12:54:37 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No, it's about race.  You know it, I know it, we all know it.pic.twitter.com/OjMTmmuEu8

912142511279427587 2017-09-24 02:31:36 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So are you trying to distract us from yet another travel ban? It won't work.
912142081052827648 2017-09-24 02:29:53 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_rates @RebeccaGWarren The paws!  THE PAWS!  Duke is a very fine dog.  And I am sure he will grow into his paws eventually.  :-)
912123859196891136 2017-09-24 01:17:29 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Courageous patriots fought and died for liberty and freedom.  Not the flag.  Freedom of expression is guaranteed in the 1st Amendment.
912121114503057408 2017-09-24 01:06:34 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Well, guess I won't be watching any more Cowboys games ever.

911954639108624384 2017-09-24 14:05:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Shouldn't you be talking about how we are going to rebuild Puerto Rico, Florida and Texas?  Worried about something?  #MuellerIsComing
911954356680970240 2017-09-24 14:03:56 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The league should continue to RESPECT the players' right to express themselves.  I for one will continue to support the NFL.

911691850079260673 2017-09-23 20:40:50 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump There's this thing called the First Amendment that guarantees freedom of speech. It's part of that pesky Constitution you keep hearing aboutpic.twitter.com/V0UnAru6uB

909413651915972609 2017-09-17 13:48:05 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The ban should be eliminated altogether.

909413185270272000 2017-09-17 13:46:14 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, did you wait to get all the facts before you spoke about this?  Or does that only wait to speak out against white supremacists?

909084344484077569 2017-09-16 15:59:32 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Better nominees would be good. In many cases any nominee at all would be a start.
909032088741048320 2017-09-16 12:31:53 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Welcome back.  Glad you are safe and sound.
908900878974930945 2017-09-15 03:50:30 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Didn't you say John McCain was NOT a war hero because he got caught?
908899995763580930 2017-09-15 03:47:00 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_rates @Hannahltwx @TomazBoeck I agree, but how does one pet a ghost dog?
908899922786881536 2017-09-15 03:46:42 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_rates @Hannahltwx He is still a good dog.
908664692524142592 2017-09-15 12:11:59 UTC <kagleslie> Our pet bunny died suddenly this week.  I curled up with Harry Potter for comfort.  He's always there when you need him.  Thanks @jk_rowling
908663126337507328 2017-09-15 12:05:46 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Seems to me single payer health care would be a great thing, not a "curse on the US and it's people".
908662527504142336 2017-09-15 12:03:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I'm pretty sure your ACA repeal (that's Obamacare) only had 49 Republican votes.  Can't even get 51 votes even in your own party.
908661856948166657 2017-09-15 12:00:43 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I don't think calling them "losers" is exactly tough.
908661668032466944 2017-09-15 11:59:58 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @Dilsedesh @RobertMaguire_ Yep.  That is exactly what happened.  I guess we better hope Kim Jong Un never calls him names...
908660918615183360 2017-09-15 11:56:59 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Funny, you were all for free speech in Charlottesville.  She told the truth.  Grow up.
908352153294655488 2017-09-14 15:30:04 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Actually I think that is exactly what your base wants. After all, that's what you promised them.
908301833151664128 2017-09-14 12:10:07 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei @thione I know, right?
908301394683285504 2017-09-14 12:08:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump When are you going to donate that million dollars you promised to those impacted by Harvey?  I am gonna need to see that cancelled check.
908301113778229248 2017-09-14 12:07:15 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump When are you going to manufacture Trump product lines in the US?  What about Ivanka?
908168967654723585 2017-09-13 03:22:09 UTC <kagleslie> @joniernst @riverbirdhf @Jensin520 You're right of course. Put rebuilding at the top of the to do list.
908122070080475137 2017-09-13 00:15:48 UTC <kagleslie> @joniernst How about we tell 45 not to go golfing every weekend?  How about Congress stop giving themselves pay raises?  How about you listen to us?
908065579210342400 2017-09-13 20:31:19 UTC <kagleslie> @joniernst How about we make the wealthy pay their fair share. That would be a start. Then make Trump release his tax returns. Then rebuild TX and FL
907947839472508928 2017-09-13 12:43:28 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump What is your plan, exactly?  Will this be as easy as repeal and replace?  Asking for a country.
907947582294556672 2017-09-13 12:42:27 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How will you fund the Coast Guard and FEMA if you cut taxes to your billionaire friends?
907947446847918081 2017-09-13 12:41:54 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Tax cuts for billionaires will not help the people impacted by Harvey and Irma.  How will we fund FEMA?
907715118749937669 2017-09-12 21:18:43 UTC <kagleslie> @joniernst Yes. Let's start with cutting 45's visits to his own golf courses. We shouldn't be paying for that
907594936400404480 2017-09-12 13:21:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How about not taking money from FEMA and not cutting the Coast Guard budget?
907594555297554432 2017-09-12 13:19:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @BreakingDTrump @impeach_d_trump I hadn't thought of that.  You are probably right.
907592530216316928 2017-09-12 13:11:36 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @AliCologne @TheRealChristiB The best way to make America great again would be to impeach Trump and Pence.
907592284329443328 2017-09-12 13:10:37 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Surely you have better things to do than tweet about yourself.

907225585948270592 2017-09-11 12:53:29 UTC <kagleslie> Thinking of everyone who lost their lives and lost loved ones in the attacks on 9/11.
906709045788147712 2017-09-09 02:40:57 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Please be safe.  If there is room in the shelter, perhaps you should go.  I just don't want anything to happen to you.
906708221737537537 2017-09-09 02:37:40 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_rates This is a h*ckin' rare hopper hound for sure.  Never thought I would see one for reals.  12/10.  Would boop snoot gently.
906483946816512001 2017-09-09 11:46:29 UTC <kagleslie> @StephenKing That's a good description.
906320834448560128 2017-09-08 00:58:20 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Does that include the mosques that opened as shelters?  Just wondering.
906266700781322241 2017-09-08 21:23:13 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_feelings You did. your best.
906224699411189760 2017-09-08 18:36:19 UTC <kagleslie> @KamalaHarris This is disgusting.
906224347152572417 2017-09-08 18:34:55 UTC <kagleslie> @joniernst Don't you think peoples lives are more important than the debt ceiling?

906137485863997440 2017-09-08 12:49:46 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Then why did you propose cutting their funding?
905773082375327744 2017-09-07 12:41:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Would you please stop sounding excited about this?
905772034181013504 2017-09-07 12:37:36 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 That sucks.  I really hope you are feeling better.

905624713602490368 2017-09-06 02:52:12 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Except of course my companies and my daugther's companies.  We will continue to make our stuff in China.
905516328898965504 2017-09-06 19:41:31 UTC <kagleslie> @PolkCoSheriff It's attitudes like this that discourage people from evacuating. This will get people killed. Shame on you.
905413710793117696 2017-09-06 12:53:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Why do you seem excited about this?  Stop it!  Millions of people could lose everything including their lives.
905261548209410049 2017-09-05 02:49:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The thing is, Congress is supposed to make the laws.  Not you.  Were you absent for every single day of your high school government class?
905226297802194944 2017-09-05 00:29:02 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump He is despicable and makes me embarrassed to be from Iowa
905180657088954371 2017-09-05 21:27:40 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Yes Congress, get ready to do your job - IMPEACH
905180439157071872 2017-09-05 21:26:48 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I am an American citizen. This is not the America I want to live in. We are better than this. #SaveDACA
905068232486342657 2017-09-05 14:00:56 UTC <kagleslie> @VAMNit @Lin_Manuel Happy Anniversary. I wish you two many more happy years together.
905067989166415877 2017-09-05 13:59:58 UTC <kagleslie> @ChelseaClinton Why are people such jerks?  Have a happy Tuesday Chelsea. I admire your grace.
905051431094374400 2017-09-05 12:54:10 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @markbland This is my fondest wish.
905051196586635265 2017-09-05 12:53:14 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I support DACA 100%.  I am an American citizen and I believe DACA is the compassionate way forward.  Do your job Congress and save DACA

905049872092598273 2017-09-05 12:47:59 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Yep.  That is exactly his plan.  I swaer if President Obama had cured cancer, Trump would make everybody get cancer.
905049513362063360 2017-09-05 12:46:33 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA OR you could just let them stay which is the compassionate, American thing to do.
904823721835278336 2017-09-04 21:49:20 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Well that will be a complete economic disaster.

904708009972072448 2017-09-04 14:09:32 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How exactly is this an embarrassment to China?  Please explain.
904707853835010048 2017-09-04 14:08:55 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, do you actually have a plan?  Asking for a country.
904707510946467840 2017-09-04 14:07:33 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump He is such an ass.
904546774110625792 2017-09-03 03:28:51 UTC <kagleslie> @ChelseaClinton That is an excellent question.
904399552710680578 2017-09-03 17:43:50 UTC <kagleslie> @ChrisEvans Awww...That's so sweet.
904322840496922628 2017-09-03 12:39:01 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @Team_Trump45 So Texas is under water and North Korea has tested a hydrogen bomb. And you are retweeting this? Grow up and do your damn job.
904322375281463296 2017-09-03 12:37:10 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Thanks Obama!

903962499724312577 2017-09-02 12:47:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Thank you President Obama!
903817500101660672 2017-09-01 03:10:58 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Have you reported that phone call about ethanol to the FBI and Mueller yet?  We are watching.
903611413280772096 2017-09-01 13:32:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So does this mean you will be firing him this weekend?
903610906382405634 2017-09-01 13:30:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If the system is rigged how did you end up winning the election?  Oh, right.  It was rigged, by you.
903610680095453184 2017-09-01 13:29:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Oh, I see you corrected the spelling.  Texas hasn't even begun healing yet.  Pay attention and learn to spell.
903271813890928640 2017-08-31 15:02:37 UTC <kagleslie> @ObamaPlusKids This might be the best thing on the internet today.  Thank you.

903269689090035716 2017-08-31 14:54:10 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei Me too. But it is better if he takes his time and has an airtight case before he does anything. Don't give 45 a way to slime his way out.
903268884593201152 2017-08-31 14:50:58 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 Yeah, but were there any car chases?  Explosions?  (I haven't read it yet, so if there are don't tell me)  ;-)
903267848033796098 2017-08-31 14:46:51 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_feelings So sad.

903089027762593792 2017-08-30 02:56:17 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU! People in Houston have lost everything. Everything. People are dying. And you are pouting like a spoiled child.
903088600891482112 2017-08-30 02:54:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump What we need is money for disaster relief in Texas.  That's what we need.
902972368531927040 2017-08-30 19:12:43 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley This sounds like tampering to me. Isn't the Senate Judiciary questioning his son?

902879914600345600 2017-08-30 13:05:20 UTC <kagleslie> @TrumpResponders First that is Condoleeza Rice.  Second, George W Bush was President when Katrina hit in 2005.  Barack Obama became president in 2008.  SMH
902879148502339586 2017-08-30 13:02:18 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Me!  I am disgusted.  He is such an attention whore.  It's ridiculous.
902744755439890432 2017-08-29 04:08:16 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Scared to talk to the people you are supposed to be representing?

902595832280731648 2017-08-29 18:16:30 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley When are you coming to Story County?
902565669224439808 2017-08-29 16:16:39 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley When will you be in Story County?
902565405520166912 2017-08-29 16:15:36 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Or we could spend that money on flood relief for Texas.
902516512115892228 2017-08-29 13:01:19 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 Thank you for this.  Anxiety is so hard to explain.
902516310797582336 2017-08-29 13:00:31 UTC <kagleslie> @AnnCoulter You have got to be kidding me.
902368504321413121 2017-08-28 03:13:11 UTC <kagleslie> @SalvationArmyUS @KamalaHarris Salvation Army is very anti LGBT.  I gave to the Red Cross instead.  But really, any and all help anywhere is good help right now.
902368168055889921 2017-08-28 03:11:51 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei @DanaDelany Yep
902339683849515009 2017-08-28 01:18:39 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Now is not the time.  Now all your energy should be focused on helping the people in the path of #HurricaneHarvey. This is not about you.

902336722423427072 2017-08-28 01:06:53 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Why would you even have to think about this?  Say yes please and then be thankful.
902336271560966150 2017-08-28 01:05:06 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Scared to face us?
902303682334687232 2017-08-28 22:55:36 UTC <kagleslie> @ChuckGrassley Did anybody ask why you voted to cut Medicaid, raise premiums and increase the uninsured rate?  When are you coming to Story County?
902240158661136384 2017-08-28 18:43:11 UTC <kagleslie> @moxienh @mochimochiland She is beautiful. Congratulations.
902151323625324544 2017-08-28 12:50:11 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Why did you cut Coast Guard funding?  Who do you think is out there rescuing people?
902150773743734785 2017-08-28 12:48:00 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I am sure that is a great comfort to the people in Houston who are sitting on their rooftops waiting for rescue.
901969791883280384 2017-08-27 00:48:50 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @EdKrassen Yep. That's probably about right.
901937730367537152 2017-08-27 22:41:26 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Don't sound so excited.  This is not exciting.  This is tragic and horrible.
901937626105643010 2017-08-27 22:41:01 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump It would be better to spend that money helping rebuild Texas, don't you think? #HurricaneHarvey
901937469314273283 2017-08-27 22:40:24 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Shouldn't you be focusing your attention on what is happening in Texas?  T

901936712531705858 2017-08-27 22:37:24 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @billprady  Hey here's an idea. How about instead of spending all that $ on a wall we don't need, we spend it to help TX.
901936013542608897 2017-08-27 22:34:37 UTC <kagleslie> @ChelseaClinton @billprady Done. Thanks.pic.twitter.com/B83XbUpriF

900689589756723200 2017-08-24 12:01:46 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump There is the small matter of the Constitution.  You probably haven't read it.

900325271143936000 2017-08-23 11:54:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump is truly frightening.  How much longer are you members of the GOP going to put up with this?

899978644793303040 2017-08-22 12:56:44 UTC <kagleslie> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio He didn't really say anything.

899817635948486657 2017-08-21 02:16:56 UTC <kagleslie> @AC360 He obviously didn't write that.
899458984834453504 2017-08-20 02:31:47 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei I want to wake up in a world where I am not worried that the president is going to tweet something stupid and maybe get us all killed.

899070670562373632 2017-08-19 00:48:46 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I see you corrected the spelling.
899070594045550592 2017-08-19 00:48:28 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump the protestors you called anti-police?  Did you have all the facts before you made that pronouncement?  I think not.
898625642685714434 2017-08-18 19:20:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump White supremacist terrorists are a much bigger threat and they are already here.  Do something.  You are a bigot and a racist.
898625391962726401 2017-08-18 19:19:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @impeach_d_trump I like it!
898625310798651392 2017-08-18 19:19:04 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are not a dictator.  Did you miss school the day they talked about checks and balances in your government class?
898624994837712897 2017-08-18 19:17:49 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump But what about white supremacists terrorists in the US?
898622312408166400 2017-08-18 19:07:09 UTC <kagleslie> @altNOAA I disagree.  They need to know we will not be complicit.
898375227574452224 2017-08-17 02:45:19 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Still waiting for you to call the murder of #HeatherHeyer terrorism.

897091154847698944 2017-08-14 13:42:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @axios When will you be going to #Charlottesville to speak and call out these hate groups? When will you be calling Heather Heyer's family? Coward
897090706828906497 2017-08-14 13:41:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump When will you be going to #Charlottesville to speak and call out these hate groups? When will you be calling Heather Heyer's family? Coward
897090631255949312 2017-08-14 13:40:48 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump When will you be going to #Charlottesville to speak and call out these hate groups? When will you be calling Heather Heyer's family? Coward
897090396794257408 2017-08-14 13:39:52 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump When will you be going to #Charlottesville to speak and call out these hate groups? When will you be calling Heather Heyer's family? Coward
896827807984222208 2017-08-13 20:16:26 UTC <kagleslie> @SpeakerRyan Best way to do that is impeach the white supremacist in chief.
896827023594795009 2017-08-13 20:13:19 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Where is your statement denouncing the violence in #Charlottesville?
896826589362761728 2017-08-13 20:11:35 UTC <kagleslie> @IowaStateFair @joniernst Where is your statement denouncing what happened in #Charlottesville?
896826008636186624 2017-08-13 20:09:17 UTC <kagleslie> @IvankaTrump Maybe you should tell your father.
896750125707661313 2017-08-13 15:07:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are disgusting.  This is the best you can do?  She had a name.  She had a family.  She deserves better.

896560446496526336 2017-08-12 02:34:02 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This was an act of terrorism. Call it what it is.
896557103875330048 2017-08-12 02:20:45 UTC <kagleslie> @BarackObama Thank you Mr. President.
896516589079670785 2017-08-12 23:39:45 UTC <kagleslie> What is happening in #Charlottesville is terrorism pure and simple.
896515696720576512 2017-08-12 23:36:13 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei He's a coward.  He won't be anywhere Charlottesville any time soon.
896436876793589760 2017-08-12 18:23:01 UTC <kagleslie> @BillClinton Thank you Mr. President.
896433238616543232 2017-08-12 18:08:33 UTC <kagleslie> Why won't @realDonaldTrump condemn white nationalists?  Right, because they voted for him.
896432883539345409 2017-08-12 18:07:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump When are you going to specifically condemn white nationalists?  Oh, right, they vote for you so never.
896432633432985600 2017-08-12 18:06:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This is the best you can do?  These people are marching in MAGA hats and your t-shirts.  You are pathetic.  And unfit to serve.
896424830618271744 2017-08-12 17:35:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Took you long enough.
896393914055372800 2017-08-12 15:32:17 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So when are you going to denounce the alt right rally on the UVA campus.  We are waiting.
896143641038553089 2017-08-11 22:57:48 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 You would just have to rewrite them anyway
896123994453061633 2017-08-11 21:39:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @matthaig1 This would be funny if it weren't so terrifying.
896063782669099010 2017-08-11 17:40:28 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 I reported it. Threatening the entire world has to be against Twitter's policies.
896034496167989249 2017-08-11 15:44:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GeorgiaDirtRoad You do know if this escalates we will all be dead.
895990945170153473 2017-08-11 12:51:02 UTC <kagleslie> @narendramodi @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump It is also possible that you will be out of office by then and sitting in a jail cell.
895990782569598976 2017-08-11 12:50:23 UTC <kagleslie> @narendramodi @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Maybe you should send someone with some experience?  Just a thought.
895990412271390724 2017-08-11 12:48:55 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I do not find this at all reassuring.  You are going to get us all killed.
895708258111021056 2017-08-10 18:07:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are going to get us all killed
895708133452132352 2017-08-10 18:07:15 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @ProgressPolls Could you please stop retweeting garbage?
895707478301839360 2017-08-10 18:04:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Is it smart to alienate the representatives that can impeach you?  Keep tweeting. You did yourself in deeper every time.
895703334040072192 2017-08-10 17:48:10 UTC <kagleslie> @ChelseaClinton I love it!
895623202684125186 2017-08-10 12:29:46 UTC <kagleslie> @KamalaHarris Thank you.
895406731815264256 2017-08-09 22:09:35 UTC <kagleslie> @ChelseaClinton You are a woman of class.
895274321689620481 2017-08-09 13:23:26 UTC <kagleslie> @foxandfriends Still waiting for any kind of response to the mosque bombing in MN.
895274116101656576 2017-08-09 13:22:37 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Don't you have better things to do than retweet junk from fox and friends?  SMH
895273954889412608 2017-08-09 13:21:58 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How about you shut up before you get us all killed?
895133255950794752 2017-08-08 04:02:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump ....actual accomplishment for the good of the country, not so much.
895133123205312513 2017-08-08 04:02:21 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If you mean threatening nuclear war and working on getting us all killed, you are correct.  If you mean any kind of.....

895094014634057728 2017-08-08 01:26:57 UTC <kagleslie> @olivialeslie98 Oh no.
894908324466053121 2017-08-08 13:09:05 UTC <kagleslie> @foxandfriends Don't you have anything better to do than retweet fox and friends when a military crisis is brewing?  SMH
894907593671540736 2017-08-08 13:06:11 UTC <kagleslie> @ARizzo44 Happy Birthday!
894729343716384770 2017-08-07 01:17:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Says the draft dodger
894729205597954048 2017-08-07 01:17:20 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The NYT has reported a record online subscriber rate.  Doesn't sound like it's failing to me.
894658762241441792 2017-08-07 20:37:25 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Unlike yourself.
894606846564106242 2017-08-07 17:11:07 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You mean aside from yourself, right?
894532704141791234 2017-08-07 12:16:30 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are a draft dodger and there is now way to hide that.
894532550860955650 2017-08-07 12:15:54 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Maybe you should call your state tv channel Lying lies and the liars who tell them.  How's the golfing?
894532339480612864 2017-08-07 12:15:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So what are you trying to distract us from today?
894531964618846210 2017-08-07 12:13:34 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Oh my god.  That mental image is going to be in my head all day now.  Horrifying.
894387216440598528 2017-08-06 02:38:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I am so glad you were able to take a break from your busy golfing schedule to tweet about this short phone call.
894387016997240833 2017-08-06 02:37:36 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @ColumbiaBugle Two treasonous conspirators.
894386754211504128 2017-08-06 02:36:33 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Supreme Court seat was stolen from President Obama. Surging economy etc is thanks to President Obama.  So, you should be thanking Mr. Obama.
894350502804283393 2017-08-06 00:12:30 UTC <kagleslie> Same shark.  Different day.
894295120547328002 2017-08-06 20:32:26 UTC <kagleslie> @tonyposnanski Agree one million percent.
894201593083592704 2017-08-06 14:20:47 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @jpritch77 @Tstano77 Like the 5 kids with 3 different wives?  Like the multiple bankruptcies?  Like refusing to pay for work completed?  Oh wait, that was Trump.
894201223955566592 2017-08-06 14:19:19 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb So would you rather go to a surgeon with a thorough knowledge of the bible, or a medical degree?  Me?  I would prefer the MD.
894200945256648705 2017-08-06 14:18:13 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So how about those Russian sanctions?
894013360932622336 2017-08-05 01:52:49 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump And golf. Don't forget the golf.
894013198818578432 2017-08-05 01:52:11 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Read the First Amendment lately?
893941064020656129 2017-08-05 21:05:32 UTC <kagleslie> @ChelseaClinton Hello Chelsea!  I love the way you handle garbage like this.  Stay beautiful.  (say hi to your mom for me).
893602262232297476 2017-08-04 22:39:16 UTC <kagleslie> @nytimes @DLoesch @NRATV Surely you are not threatening violence against the reporters at the NYT. Because that's what it sounds like.
893578534526038016 2017-08-04 21:04:59 UTC <kagleslie> @POTUS @VP Thanks Obama!
893457146418954241 2017-08-04 13:02:37 UTC <kagleslie> @BarackObama Happy Birthday Mr. President.  Thank you for everything you did for Americans and America.  It is greatly appreciated.
893454685776089088 2017-08-04 12:52:51 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump And how many of those jobs will be filled by robots?
893454250638028801 2017-08-04 12:51:07 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @DaysLeft4Trump i am hoping we don't have to wait that long.
893454075064451073 2017-08-04 12:50:25 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Thank you President Obama.  He is the reason consumer confidence is so high.  Not you.
893188070803202048 2017-08-03 19:13:25 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump P ##
893186889964040192 2017-08-03 19:08:43 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @KellyScaletta I continue to hope we won't have to wait that long.
893186084296953856 2017-08-03 19:05:31 UTC <kagleslie> @Cap_Kaveman Thank you. I had no idea how much I needed to see a basket of puppies until I saw this.
893185691387138049 2017-08-03 19:03:58 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei Honestly I'll believe it when I see it.  But I hope I am wrong.
893159427657936901 2017-08-03 17:19:36 UTC <kagleslie> @funder Good
893098680395460608 2017-08-03 13:18:13 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are right!  Thank you President Obama!
893098410051612672 2017-08-03 13:17:08 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump AND, we have health care.  The GOP congress couldn't get the votes to take it away.  Thank you Senators McCaine, Murkowski and Collins.
893097972577296384 2017-08-03 13:15:24 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Remember the Cold War?  Khruschev saying he would bury us? I am going to go out on a limb and say things were worse during the cold war.
893097044507799552 2017-08-03 13:11:43 UTC <kagleslie> @StephenKing Looking forward to it all!
892935029692784640 2017-08-02 02:27:55 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You mean fake news like the Seth Rich story?
892731973692784641 2017-08-02 13:01:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Thanks Obama.
892731835733729280 2017-08-02 13:00:30 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No!  Keep tweeting.  You dig yourself in deeper every time.
892731567512178690 2017-08-02 12:59:26 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_feelings All.  The.  Time.
892566274760486913 2017-08-01 02:02:37 UTC <kagleslie> @WalshFreedom No, You have a Constitutional right to carry a gun, when and how is a question for lawmakers. God has nothing to do with it.
892564880213102598 2017-08-01 01:57:05 UTC <kagleslie> @ChelseaClinton @GenePark This is what class looks like.
892450538511585280 2017-08-01 18:22:43 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump It should
892369778479955968 2017-08-01 13:01:49 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Thanks @BarackObama!
892119019746209792 2017-07-31 20:25:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Most of that is still thanks to Obama's policies. And no chaos?  You're kidding, right?
892003355173826560 2017-07-31 12:45:47 UTC <kagleslie> @jk_rowling Happy Birthday! And happy birthday to Harry too.
891765294439571456 2017-07-30 20:59:49 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Yes, GOP senators.  The world is watching.  Don't take our health care away.  History has its eyes on you.
891765102394920960 2017-07-30 20:59:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @impeach_d_trump @DTrumpExposed @eugenegu Yes
891764982437875712 2017-07-30 20:58:34 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So rather than try to fix it, you will just sit back and watch Americans die.  And threaten Members of Congress at the same time?  Classy.
891685131534073856 2017-07-30 15:41:16 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei Oh the sickening irony.
891494478682390529 2017-07-29 03:03:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are going to get us all killed.
891293304683454464 2017-07-29 13:44:17 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You lost.  Again.  Stop whining and do your damn job.  You will never be the president or the man that Obama is.
891292949698490368 2017-07-29 13:42:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump It was 3 REPUBLICANS who killed the ACA repeal.  Dems stand united to do what is best for Americans.  3 members of the GOP stood with them.
891142013013434369 2017-07-28 03:43:07 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Just out of curiosity, have you ever actually read the constitution?
890918421998829570 2017-07-28 12:54:38 UTC <kagleslie> So much winning, I am exhausted.  @realDonaldTrumphttps://twitter.com/morningmika/status/890917822066556929
890917802252619778 2017-07-28 12:52:11 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei @McJesse I laughed out loud.  Thanks.
890917204786651139 2017-07-28 12:49:48 UTC <kagleslie> @SenatorCollins Thank you for your vote last night.
890912671058604032 2017-07-28 12:31:47 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No.  49 GOP senators let America down when they voted to take health care away from millions of Americans.
890762086187499520 2017-07-27 02:33:25 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_feelings Of course you deserve them.
890746517845413888 2017-07-27 01:31:33 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Well this will be interesting.
890597124848615424 2017-07-27 15:37:55 UTC <kagleslie> Death to all spiders.
890556792064888832 2017-07-27 12:57:39 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 Very well stated.  And I am absolutely stealing the word "fuckturnip".
890556216837058564 2017-07-27 12:55:22 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_feelings You are already doing the best job.  Sometimes humans are just sad.
890188600771579904 2017-07-26 12:34:35 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump It won't make any difference.  Republicans won't do anything at all.
890187523380662272 2017-07-26 12:30:19 UTC <kagleslie> @crehage Just now?
890021411955200000 2017-07-25 01:30:15 UTC <kagleslie> @POTUS @VP There is absolutely nothing Christian about this bill. You have nothing to be proud of.
890020826342453248 2017-07-25 01:27:55 UTC <kagleslie> @POTUS @VP @James4531 @BaldBeliefs And then we all end up paying for it.
890020232852627456 2017-07-25 01:25:33 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.     J.K Rowling.
890017219102601217 2017-07-25 01:13:35 UTC <kagleslie> Yephttps://twitter.com/stephenking/status/890006422150418433
889665422844473344 2017-07-24 01:55:40 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Yep, they have one more chance to do the right thing and vote no.
889665308474187776 2017-07-24 01:55:13 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Any senator voting against the ACA is telling America they care about saving our healthcare.  Fix the ACA don't kill it.
889452634742116352 2017-07-24 11:50:08 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump FYI your approval rating is 35%, you lost the popular vote and you won because you cheated.  How's the golfing?
889451808808210432 2017-07-24 11:46:51 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How about we start with you?
889451466334851072 2017-07-24 11:45:29 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @AmandaJuneBell Honestly, I doubt it.
889314828967440385 2017-07-23 02:42:32 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, you are threatening your own party now? Good luck with that. They have more to fear from their constituents (who want the ACA) than you.
888884794242805760 2017-07-22 22:13:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump deflect deflect deflect.  Hillary was cleared twice.  You, not so much
888884590609354752 2017-07-22 22:12:55 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Repeal and delay is abhorrent.  Just reach across the aisle and fix the ACA.  Dems can't offer ideas if they aren't invited to the meetings.
888884212203479040 2017-07-22 22:11:25 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Do you have trouble with simple math?  Once again, if you have 52 GOP senators, you have the majority.  Dems can't obstruct.  Blame the GOP
888376175806042113 2017-07-21 12:32:40 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Not the dinner, the undisclosed meeting with Putin is what's sinister.
888375950412591105 2017-07-21 12:31:46 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump 6 months in office.  991 tweets.  0 - that's ZERO pieces of major legislation.
888375501831770112 2017-07-21 12:29:59 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, did you have fun driving the fire truck?
887734967085789184 2017-07-19 18:04:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Of course you could have invited Dem leaders too and tried a bipartisan approach. But it's more fun to blame them for your failure.
887677345796169728 2017-07-19 14:15:46 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @SHABOOTY OK this is funny, but kind of insulting to the Wicked Witch of the West, don't you think?
887677192573988864 2017-07-19 14:15:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @impeach_d_trump Let's hope.  We know papa trump would turn on baby trump in a heartbeat.
887423068628557824 2017-07-18 21:25:21 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How did the Dems let you down?  You didn't need a single democrat to pass this bill. Blame your own people.
887422614855196672 2017-07-18 21:23:33 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So you would let the ACA fail outright because you can't get your way?  Grow up.
887422163053096963 2017-07-18 21:21:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Even GOP senators won't vote for this bill. That's how bad it is.
887420112428568578 2017-07-18 21:13:36 UTC <kagleslie> @VP Taking healthcare away from millions is not an option. This is a funny kind of Christianity you practice.
887419608122236928 2017-07-18 21:11:36 UTC <kagleslie> @VP @TJSeraphim @AmazingCorn @ls_cc_askme So then let's go with a single payer system. Then it's a government agency just like school or social security. Easy

887139786858926081 2017-07-17 02:39:42 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Dems will not take agree to take health care away from MILLIONS of people.  GOP had 7 years to come up with a plan and failed.
887138904784220160 2017-07-17 02:36:11 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Yes, Fox news is distorting democracy.
887138788572618759 2017-07-17 02:35:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump But I didn't think you were a politician.

886680151974653952 2017-07-16 20:13:16 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump It's 36% and right now it's the only poll that counts. Election polling is no longer relevant. You cheated, and stole the election. Move on.

885337784885575681 2017-07-12 03:19:11 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump That would work for me.

885122256954957824 2017-07-12 13:02:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I don't think you understand the meaning of the phrase "witch hunt". It implies innocence, and your son is 100% guilty.
885121912761982978 2017-07-12 13:01:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Oh like the sources that told you Barack Obama was born in Kenya?

884761589618012161 2017-07-11 13:09:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump That have nothing to do with you
884761357287116800 2017-07-11 13:08:40 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Once again, the Dems can't obstruct because they are the minority party.
884760793677430784 2017-07-11 13:06:25 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump It will never happen.
884600943425277952 2017-07-10 02:31:14 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Don't you have work to do?  Stop retweeting fox and friends and do your damn job.
884600803683598337 2017-07-10 02:30:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You know what is illegal?  COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA to rig an election.  That's what.
884600649404608513 2017-07-10 02:30:04 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Good luck with that.
884123749104193539 2017-07-09 18:55:02 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Well of course you believe your bestest buddy.  The rest of us know better.
884123396782641154 2017-07-09 18:53:38 UTC <kagleslie> @crehage Bring back Obama
884083296719818753 2017-07-09 16:14:18 UTC <kagleslie> @Malala So happy to see you here.  I look forward to what you will have to say.
883723128085635072 2017-07-08 16:23:07 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Um, you are supposed to be the one representing our country, not your unqualfied, unelected un-vetted daughter.  Just saying.
883691810203348992 2017-07-08 14:18:40 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump How about this:  Impeachment, then prison, then exile.
883691636710047745 2017-07-08 14:17:59 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump The GOP would have gone completely batshit crazy.

883350567527096321 2017-07-07 15:42:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I'm pretty sure that is yet another lie.

882951529745063936 2017-07-06 13:17:03 UTC <kagleslie> "very very strongly"  "very very dangerous" "very very bad behavior"  @realDonaldTrump needs a damn thesaurus.

879512461451382785 2017-06-26 01:31:26 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You said you needed a 90 day ban to review vetting procedures.  It's been more than 90 days.  Why haven't you reviewed vetting procedures?
879510996209086465 2017-06-26 01:25:36 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This is just a temporary decision, allowing partial enforcement until they hear it fully in October.  Don't get too giggly.
879509517360410625 2017-06-26 01:19:44 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump I feel exactly the same way.

879383965165133824 2017-06-26 17:00:50 UTC <kagleslie> @RoguePOTUSStaff I wish I had seen that
879341726464446464 2017-06-26 14:12:59 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, let me get this straight you want millions of people to lose their health insurance and access to life saving care, just so you can win?
879340900123635712 2017-06-26 14:09:42 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Ok cupcake, did you fail US gov in high school?  The Dems are the minority party.  They can't obstruct anything.  Got it?
879340620711677966 2017-06-26 14:08:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, Obama did nothing about Russian meddling, but there was no Russian meddling?  Get your story straight.
879174887260246016 2017-06-25 03:10:02 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump Oh god. How can I unsee this now.
879003971792273410 2017-06-25 15:50:52 UTC <kagleslie> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Taking a break from all that golfing?
879003471692922882 2017-06-25 15:48:53 UTC <kagleslie> @brianklaas @CoachTenney Um, I think you had a typo there.  I think you mean to say the far RIGHT are the new Nazi party.
878969878408986624 2017-06-25 13:35:24 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You do spend a lot of time talking about the election.  Guilty conscience?

878787378328072192 2017-06-24 01:30:12 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I can't imagine any Republican Senator that will keep his or her job if they vote for this atrocity.
878786741943107584 2017-06-24 01:27:41 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @RJSzczerba Or golfing.
878786567397134336 2017-06-24 01:26:59 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump At least with the ACA we HAD doctors and plans.  If this bill passes PEOPLE WILL DIE.
878785723108925440 2017-06-24 01:23:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Better a broken Obamacare than the death bill the Senate put forward.
878785567219232769 2017-06-24 01:23:00 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How was the golfing today?
878736862805987328 2017-06-24 22:09:28 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Quit finger pointing. If you really had nothing to hide you would welcome this investigation. But you do have something to hide dont you?
878715290858770432 2017-06-24 20:43:45 UTC <kagleslie> I have decided Wonder Woman may be the best movie I have ever seen.

878451342972473345 2017-06-23 03:14:55 UTC <kagleslie> @POTUS @foxandfriends I do believe this is called witness intimidation, and/or witness tampering.  I'm pretty sure this is an impeachable offense.
878449897397264384 2017-06-23 03:09:11 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_rates The dogs are not just good.  They are great.
878434696463601666 2017-06-23 02:08:46 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Don't ever come to Iowa again.  We don't want you here.
878243480576827392 2017-06-23 13:28:57 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If you really have nothing to hide, particiapte fully in the investigations.  Stop trying to deflect blame.
878243288851111937 2017-06-23 13:28:11 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Sp you lied.  As usual.
878241818197893120 2017-06-23 13:22:21 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump To reiterate you don't need Dem support.  GOP has the majority.  And you STILL haven't accomplished anything except by executive order.
877719596102328321 2017-06-21 02:47:13 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @andy_abeyta I see plenty of empty seats.  Doesn't look so packed to me.
877164246114676737 2017-06-20 14:00:27 UTC <kagleslie> @TheHazelHayes Oh dear.  That sounds serious.
877140289667952641 2017-06-20 12:25:16 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Still waiting for a statement about the #FinsburyParkattack   Oh right, the victims were Muslim and the terrorist was white.
876984971625459712 2017-06-19 02:08:05 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Donnie, we have talked about this.  Dems can't obstruct anything, they are the minority party.  Blame the GOP.

876785709314658304 2017-06-19 12:56:17 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump And the victims were Muslims.
876785666058838017 2017-06-19 12:56:07 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Anything to day about the most recent terrorist attack in London?  Yeah, I didn't think so.  The perpetrator was a white man
876451195484856320 2017-06-18 14:47:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump A stolen Supreme Court seat doesn't count as a win. Health care & tax cuts stalled because the GOP opposes your plan. Nothing to see here.
876450589290397696 2017-06-18 14:44:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Your agenda has stalled. Congress is about to head to a summer recess with nothing accomplished. Can't blame Dems, they are the minority.
876449286451597313 2017-06-18 14:39:28 UTC <kagleslie> @RoguePOTUSStaff Calling for more violence is not the answer.  If were not a white man people would be screaming to lock him up for terrorism.
876064900094844928 2017-06-17 13:12:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump   Here is what a legit poll has to say.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/875797155788836865
875888102958616576 2017-06-16 01:29:31 UTC <kagleslie> @nycjayjay @LHarasiuk Agree one million percent.
875702748762841088 2017-06-16 13:12:59 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Actually keep tweeting.  You dig yourself in deeper every time.
875529177260331008 2017-06-15 01:43:17 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Because your alleged non-dealings" were illegal.
875528987908485124 2017-06-15 01:42:31 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump And calling people names is very presidential.  We aren't talking about Secretary Clinton, we are talking about you.
875527031773122561 2017-06-15 01:34:45 UTC <kagleslie> @BevVincent @jk_rowling @StephenKing 45 is clearly a death eater.

875091715073376256 2017-06-14 20:44:57 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Just once couldn't you keep your mouth shut?  Remember when Trump suggested 2nd amendment remedies to take care of his opponents?
874975067968503809 2017-06-14 13:01:27 UTC <kagleslie> My heart goes out to Steve Scalise, the other victims in Washington, and their families.  Horrible.
874840538444427268 2017-06-13 04:06:52 UTC <kagleslie> @StephenKing Congratulations.
874799212126490627 2017-06-13 01:22:39 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Couldn't have anything to do with the fact that you have been withholding funds now would it?
874799055381176321 2017-06-13 01:22:02 UTC <kagleslie> @DeptVetAffairs @realDonaldTrump Didn't you just block a veteran's group here?  Sounds like you really care a lot.

874615354932244480 2017-06-13 13:12:04 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If you truly believe that, call for a special prosecutor. But you are just trying to deflect.  Coward.
874615113835315200 2017-06-13 13:11:07 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Because your travel ban is unconstitutional.

874614483771154432 2017-06-13 13:08:37 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Where is your apology to us for destroying the environment, trashing our healthcare and colluding with Russia?  #TrumpRussia #NoBanNoWall
874342708583772160 2017-06-12 19:08:40 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This is a great symbol for the huge step backwards the US has taken since your election.
874341820624457728 2017-06-12 19:05:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump  You should be ashamed of yourself. https://twitter.com/jules_su/status/874311446993055744
874341657487036416 2017-06-12 19:04:30 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @Cernovich This was a hate crime, not a terrorist attack.

873893885973606401 2017-06-11 13:25:13 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump James Comey will be lauded as an American Hero.  You will be in prison.
873893727202357248 2017-06-11 13:24:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Your message is crystal clear.  Everything for the 1%.  And the rest of us can just go away.
873893489704087552 2017-06-11 13:23:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Oh Donald, let me explain this to you again.  The Republicans control every branch of government.  The Democrats can't obstruct anything.
873701113274540033 2017-06-10 00:39:12 UTC <kagleslie> I would like to know where I can get one of these.https://twitter.com/Impeach_D_Trump/status/873628336135839745
873603490576314369 2017-06-10 18:11:17 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei Honestly it makes more sense than some of Trump's tweets.
873522394379546625 2017-06-10 12:49:02 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This is going to be a disaster.  The Great Recession Part 2.  And you will have nobody to blame but yourself.
873384952850771968 2017-06-09 03:42:54 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Where do they  make those Make America Great Again hats?
873384893778198528 2017-06-09 03:42:40 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Or the Chinese factories you use to manufacture the Trump line of clothing?
873384774068580353 2017-06-09 03:42:11 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Oh, you mean like that Russian steel they are using in the DAPL?

873146314707677185 2017-06-09 11:54:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Comey accused you of obstruction of justice, and abuse of power.  I am not sure how you are vindicated by that.
873145977259118596 2017-06-09 11:53:17 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Not leaking.  He was a private citizen, and it was not classified material.  Therefore, not leaking.

872082954234863616 2017-06-06 13:29:13 UTC <kagleslie> To the people of London, I apologize for our buffoon of a president.
872079396303241216 2017-06-06 13:15:05 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This will help the ACLU arguments against the ban in court.  Thanks.
872079013694537728 2017-06-06 13:13:33 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump ACA was imperfect, but your exalted plan will knock 24 million people off the health insurance rolls.  You should be ashamed.
872078314185404416 2017-06-06 13:10:47 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You do remember the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, right?
872078095137873920 2017-06-06 13:09:54 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Crying fake news every time the media says something you don't like doesn't make it so.

871897413979688960 2017-06-05 01:11:57 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Here's another thought.  You could try nominating a new head of the FBI.  That would help keep American safe, don't you think?
871897201483579393 2017-06-05 01:11:06 UTC <kagleslie> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump It is hard to approve people who haven't been nominated.  Just saying...
871699112307150848 2017-06-05 12:03:58 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The courts are not political.  You are just saying that because you know you are going to lose and need someone to blame.
871698976994721795 2017-06-05 12:03:26 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, I'm guessing you know the Supreme Court is going to say this is unconstitutional.  And you are now throwing your DOJ under the bus
871698780814532608 2017-06-05 12:02:39 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I am sure the ACLU will add this to their legal arguments against it.  Thanks!

871356403201576960 2017-06-04 13:22:10 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So instead of offering assistance and comfort you take pot shots.  You are the worst.
871355850283261952 2017-06-04 13:19:58 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Shame on you for using a moment of tragedy to try to advance your political agenda.

870607470196137985 2017-06-02 11:46:10 UTC <kagleslie> @ARizzo44 Congratulations!  I hope you two have many many happy years together.
870464319418511360 2017-06-01 02:17:20 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The best way to do that is for you to resign, effective yesterday.
870464198102351873 2017-06-01 02:16:51 UTC <kagleslie> I love @dog_rates so much.https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/870374049280663552
870437763392438274 2017-06-01 00:31:49 UTC <kagleslie> I feel like I need to apologize to my children and their children and their children and so on.  #climatechange
870254279684128768 2017-06-01 12:22:43 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Don't you think name calling is a little childish for the President of the United States?
870253953518374912 2017-06-01 12:21:25 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This is a terrible terrible thing you are doing and it will take decades to undo the damage.  This does not make America great.
870253620230574080 2017-06-01 12:20:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No, the real story is that you and your team are in bed with the Russians. But keep deflecting.  We see you  we see your lies.
870244052771504128 2017-06-01 11:42:05 UTC <kagleslie> @impeach_d_trump I just hope our next president knows what he or she is doing and is not in bed with Russia.
870072905891274752 2017-05-31 00:22:00 UTC <kagleslie> @dog_rates @AnneWheaton I would say everything plus 10
869606238476283904 2017-05-30 17:27:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You really have no idea what you are doing, do you?
869605960662347776 2017-05-30 17:26:32 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No they are laughing at how they have you wrapped around their little finger.
869605813303869440 2017-05-30 17:25:57 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @ColeLedford11 @AngeloG85 You are right.  But treason and obstruction of justice are.
869605742927638528 2017-05-30 17:25:40 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @ColeLedford11 That is an excellent point.
869605427633418241 2017-05-30 17:24:25 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Changing the rules so you can win is the same as cheating.  Sad.
869605235576246275 2017-05-30 17:23:39 UTC <kagleslie> @foxandfriends And we all know anything with unnamed sources is FAKE NEWS!  Just ask the president.
869604363563565057 2017-05-30 17:20:11 UTC <kagleslie> @idinamenzel Happy birthday!  Can't wait to see you in Kansas City later this summer!
869194598496817153 2017-05-29 14:11:55 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei This made me laugh out loud.  Thanks.  I needed that this morning.
869012858104926208 2017-05-28 02:09:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump unless of course you are on medicaid.  Or medicare.  Or nutrition assistance.  Or watch public television.  Or are not a millionaire.
869011458050453505 2017-05-28 02:04:11 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @catherinebouris @bessbell Congratulations!
868964407904264192 2017-05-28 22:57:14 UTC <kagleslie> @alo_oficial @hananurrehman @FernandoLovesMe I will also volunteer.
868963450214592512 2017-05-28 22:53:25 UTC <kagleslie> @RoguePOTUSStaff Well of course not.  But maybe the Russians still have their copies...

868616169103794177 2017-05-27 23:53:27 UTC <kagleslie> @BarackObama Thank you sir, for your compassion and your thoughtfulness.  We miss having a man of thought and intelligence in the White House.

868482559373701120 2017-05-27 15:02:32 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are an embarrassment.

868215499242471425 2017-05-26 21:21:20 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, you cozy up to the Saudis.  You don't care about anybody but yourself.
868099237455818753 2017-05-26 13:39:21 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Carrier layoffs have started.  Just sayin...

867200069950480384 2017-05-23 02:06:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump But health care?  Nah, Americans don't need that.  Right?  Health care is only for the rich, right?

866859546081452032 2017-05-22 03:33:15 UTC <kagleslie> @ArianaGrande This was NOT your fault.  My heart goes out to everyone in that concert hall, including you.
866103732089565184 2017-05-20 01:29:55 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei @spinderella2525 Oh god how do I unsee this now???
865922708319727616 2017-05-20 13:30:36 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Please at least try not to say anything offensive.
865911792467423232 2017-05-20 12:47:13 UTC <kagleslie> @andersoncooper No need to apologize.  Thank you for finally calling him out.   Now, I think CNN should stop giving him a place to spew his nonsense.
865774241236570112 2017-05-19 03:40:39 UTC <kagleslie> @IanBoothby Good one!
865730608290562048 2017-05-19 00:47:16 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If you really want to protect America you'll resign.
865373310737145860 2017-05-18 01:07:29 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Lock him up!  Lock him up!  (how do you like that chant now?)

865176203484950528 2017-05-18 12:04:15 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If you have nothing to hide you have no reason to worry.  But you do have something to hide don't you?
865175781097562112 2017-05-18 12:02:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If there is nothing to hide you have nothing to fear. Trump supporters should welcome this investigation. Unless there is something to hide.
865174413620256768 2017-05-18 11:57:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You spelled counsel wrong.
864449605672603650 2017-05-16 11:57:01 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are going to get someone killed with this kind of behavior.  You know that, right?
864318562164453376 2017-05-15 03:16:18 UTC <kagleslie> @SpeakerRyan Remember this?https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/751198307972767744
864318372070260737 2017-05-15 03:15:32 UTC <kagleslie> @SethAbramson Oh god yes.
864292505868795904 2017-05-15 01:32:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump And then you leaked classified information which will probably get somebody killed.  Good job.
864251955543232512 2017-05-15 22:51:37 UTC <kagleslie> @GovHowardDean @runforsomething @EmergeAmerica @ColorOfChange @swingleft @IndivisibleTeam @HillaryClinton @joey_stubb Why are you describing Trump?
864103977763434497 2017-05-15 13:03:37 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei I had exactly the same thought. 
863849752189947905 2017-05-14 20:13:25 UTC <kagleslie> @thehill @mhschrader I'm sure they do
863809004216229893 2017-05-14 17:31:30 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @RJSzczerba I think both.  Take your pick.
863808804466675712 2017-05-14 17:30:42 UTC <kagleslie> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump You know what you could do?  You could push to close the wage gap between men and women, and push for paid maternity leave for all.
863807849239105536 2017-05-14 17:26:54 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 @AstroKatie That is a good point.
863807576760348674 2017-05-14 17:25:49 UTC <kagleslie> Agree.  Agree.  Agree.https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/863758866416365568
863807519042531329 2017-05-14 17:25:35 UTC <kagleslie> @SethAbramson I agree one million percent.
863752308756271104 2017-05-14 13:46:12 UTC <kagleslie> @YarnHarlot Oh no.
863751354975756292 2017-05-14 13:42:25 UTC <kagleslie> @PBCountySheriff Good dog Casper!  13/10.  Would pet with permission.
863547655640711169 2017-05-13 00:12:59 UTC <kagleslie> I wish I could watch the Eurovision song contest.
863012076016586752 2017-05-12 12:44:47 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Um, no.
863011856348327936 2017-05-12 12:43:55 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @VeeVee @TalkMMA No, a real traitor is someone who colludes with Russia to win an election.
863011314137956352 2017-05-12 12:41:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are clearly running scared.
863010467438047234 2017-05-12 12:38:24 UTC <kagleslie> @SethAbramson He is a chid.
862843029035655168 2017-05-11 01:33:03 UTC <kagleslie> @StephenKing It is good protection against the Dementors.
862475593086103553 2017-05-10 01:13:00 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You can't fire everybody.  Sooner or later the truth will be revealed and you will be out.
862283169462185984 2017-05-10 12:28:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump We will.  Because I think you have finally gone too far, and the impeachment hearings can't be far behind.  So thanks for speeding this up.
862282976960425984 2017-05-10 12:27:36 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump you forgot this part "And won't investigate my campaign"  We see you.  We see your bullshit.
862142335257366529 2017-05-09 03:08:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Also, didn't anybody ever tell you it is childish to call people names?
862142270266642432 2017-05-09 03:08:29 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump What are you hiding?  It must be something big.  Don't worry.  We will find it.  And then you will be impeached.  And I cannot wait.
861925554668191745 2017-05-09 12:47:20 UTC <kagleslie> I love this!https://twitter.com/lianamaeby/status/861684561402404864
861923931720212480 2017-05-09 12:40:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump It isn't a hoax, and it will end at your impeachment.
861582247568297984 2017-05-08 14:03:09 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Remember wikileaks?  You said you loved wikileaks.  Getting nervous?  I think you are.
861555755807375365 2017-05-08 12:17:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I thought you were a big fan of extreme vetting?  How's that working out for you?
861549598611001345 2017-05-08 11:53:25 UTC <kagleslie> @PGA_JohnDaly @realDonaldTrump Shouldn't you be, oh I don't know, working?

861231397268226048 2017-05-07 14:49:00 UTC <kagleslie> @RealDonad_Trump You know what else would save money.  Melania moving to the WH, you NOT GOLFING all the time.  That would save tons of money.
861231023509704704 2017-05-07 14:47:31 UTC <kagleslie> @RealDonad_Trump Oh we will fix this mess alright.  We will vote all your cronies out.
861216123932561409 2017-05-07 13:48:19 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @brunelldonald You do know that hat was made in China, right?
861215862929444864 2017-05-07 13:47:16 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump To my republican senators:  if you vote to kill the ACA (the correct name for Obamacare) I will do everything I can to vote you out.
860645101848145920 2017-05-05 23:59:16 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No it's terrible and you know it.  You even told the PM of Australia that you knew the Australian plan was superior.  Shame on you.
860644738663407616 2017-05-05 23:57:50 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @RoguePOTUSStaff @mosercounty Yep.  Agree 100%
860643587326914561 2017-05-05 23:53:15 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei Oh you are funny.  My rep NEVER hods town halls.  @SteveKingIA is a coward.
860101542455758850 2017-05-04 11:59:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I think you are the one who is out of control here.  The media is just doing their job.

859566542304026624 2017-05-02 00:33:28 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump A shutdown won't fix anything, it just creates a bigger mess and costs the American economy a ton of money.  To use your rhetoric:  Bad!
859381399379480576 2017-05-02 12:17:46 UTC <kagleslie> @jk_rowling @POTUS @TheRealBeatBoss Actually, all three branches of government run the USA together.  The President is just one piece of the government.  He is not a king.
859239719066099714 2017-05-01 02:54:47 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @tonyposnanski @Mike_P_Williams I'm pretty sure my pet rabbit would be a better president.
859238669516984324 2017-05-01 02:50:37 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Well he was a slave holder so probably not.  He would have probably been on the confederate side.  And just let it happen.
859192640784527361 2017-05-01 23:47:43 UTC <kagleslie> @SethAbramson I like it.

858697824715902976 2017-04-30 15:01:29 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Coward surrounding yourself with like minded people, hiding from criticism.  And did't you just say the campaign was over.  Stop it.
858697294362935300 2017-04-30 14:59:23 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Sounds a lot like what the Republican Congress did for the past seven years.  Dems can't obstruct anything.  THEY ARE THE MINORITY PARTY
858696958415966209 2017-04-30 14:58:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Didn't you say you were going to do this on day one?  This is day 101.  Just sayin...
858449535764496384 2017-04-29 22:34:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Mexico is not paying for the wall.  Congress says, neither are we. #100daysofshame
858449249964617728 2017-04-29 22:33:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Defeat ISIS in 30 days.  Day 100, ISIS still out there.   #100daysofshame
858449164950282243 2017-04-29 22:33:24 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump 3.  Repeal and replace Obamacare on day one.  Day 100, Obamacare still alive and well.   #100daysofshame
858448337049194496 2017-04-29 22:30:07 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump 2.  Second immigration ban blocked by courts #100daysofshame
858448273476120577 2017-04-29 22:29:52 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump 1.  Immigration ban blocked by the courts #100daysofshame
858402245993533443 2017-04-29 19:26:58 UTC <kagleslie> @SethAbramson Complete disaster
857925608818475012 2017-04-28 11:52:59 UTC <kagleslie> Wow.  This is so cool. https://twitter.com/planetepics/status/857764574082330624
857925330962714624 2017-04-28 11:51:53 UTC <kagleslie> @Lin_Manuel Thanks.  I needed this today.
857924979811397632 2017-04-28 11:50:29 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei I know exactly 100% how you feel.
857775140167446528 2017-04-27 01:55:04 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If my options are health care for millions or a few more fighter jets, I am going to choose the health care.  Maybe that's just me.
857774238232707076 2017-04-27 01:51:29 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump For the third time, Democrats cannot block anything, they are the minority party.  You and the GOP are to blame.  #100daysofshame
857565394382487552 2017-04-27 12:01:37 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So one more campaign promise broken?  #100daysofshame
857565098478624768 2017-04-27 12:00:26 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Once again, the Democrats are not the majority party.  YOUR party is.  YOUR OWN PARTY won't play ball.  Only one to blame is you.
857416977866006532 2017-04-26 02:11:52 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump How can the Democrats bail out anyone?  The Republicans control both houses.  AND YOU STILL CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE! #100daysofshame
857415938400026624 2017-04-26 02:07:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You do realize you have a Congress to pass legislation right?  Not everything has to be an executive order.
857415294805045248 2017-04-26 02:05:10 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You have no idea what you are talking about.
857414367905812482 2017-04-26 02:01:29 UTC <kagleslie> @olivialeslie98 so proud of you.
857206270780223489 2017-04-26 12:14:35 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Ah, another failure. Just like the muslim ban, and the healthcare repeal, and the wall,  #100daysofshame
857205340043177985 2017-04-26 12:10:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Yeah.  Good luck with that.
857056048292745216 2017-04-25 02:17:39 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You have both houses of Congress.  You shouldn't have to be relying on executive orders to get anything done.
856845660389347328 2017-04-25 12:21:39 UTC <kagleslie> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Perhaps an actual diplomat would have been a better choice than your daughter.  She has zero qualifications.
856675335328468992 2017-04-24 01:04:50 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So you are just waiting for the ACA to explode so millions of Americans can lose their health insurance?  Wow.  #100daysofshame
856674740320313344 2017-04-24 01:02:28 UTC <kagleslie> @WorldJewishCong @realDonaldTrump You should maybe get rid of the anti-Semites you have in your administration.  That would be a good thing.
856245009888182272 2017-04-23 20:34:53 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Also, you didn't beat Hillary in the popular vote.  You won on a technicality.  #notmypresident
856244727204761602 2017-04-23 20:33:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Democrats don't want money to go to the wall because you promised the US would not have to pay for it.  Did you forget that part?
856244459406843905 2017-04-23 20:32:42 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Mexico is never going to pay for this and you cannot make them.  You are lying.  Again.
856243793770815488 2017-04-23 20:30:03 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump What are you even talking about?  These tweets don't make any sense.
856193800166944773 2017-04-23 17:11:23 UTC <kagleslie> Happy #worldbookday http://imgfave.com/view/5239501 via @imgfave
855934945835061249 2017-04-22 00:02:48 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump yeah, about taxes, when are we going to see yours?  You promised.  Or were you lying as usual?
855934762808213505 2017-04-22 00:02:04 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Guess what?  The election is over.  Quit campaigning and do your job
855933647618232324 2017-04-22 23:57:38 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Said the man who appointed a climate change denier to head the EPA.
855933167936712705 2017-04-22 23:55:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Said the man who restarted construction of the DAPL pipeline
855782725290262528 2017-04-22 13:57:56 UTC <kagleslie> This is amazing.  Happy Earth Day everyone. https://twitter.com/AustinOnSocial/status/854906241612689408
855398667909550083 2017-04-21 12:31:49 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So you know you've accomplished nothing and you are already blaming the media for telling the truth.  Pre-emptive whining.

854663301145534464 2017-04-19 11:49:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This shouldn't have even been close.  We will #FlipTheHouse in 2018.
854661913422295040 2017-04-19 11:44:13 UTC <kagleslie> @ossoff @realDonaldTrump @williamlegate Or getting help from the Russians.
854504416828895232 2017-04-18 01:18:23 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA I will be sure to post a similar tweet when we vote you out.

854502081801203712 2017-04-18 01:09:06 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Boy you must be really worried about this election to be tweeting so much.
854298641967833088 2017-04-18 11:40:43 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump It's tax day.  When are you going to release your tax returns?
854131463708606465 2017-04-17 00:36:24 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump They are telling the truth.  Just because you don't like something they write doesn't make it fake news.
853621298945290245 2017-04-16 14:49:11 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile back at Mar A Lago...Trump is golfing.  Again.  Or still, it's hard to tell he golfs so much.
853619707810918400 2017-04-16 14:42:52 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump No paid protestors.  Just a lot of people who want to see your tax returns.  #resist #persist
853618787651923968 2017-04-16 14:39:13 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump We would stop bringing them up if you would just release them.  Another campaign "promise" broken...
853415813382107137 2017-04-15 01:12:40 UTC <kagleslie> @StephenKing @davematt88 Same
853327779349311488 2017-04-15 19:22:51 UTC <kagleslie> Show us your tax returns @realDonaldTrump.  You promised to release them after the election.  We are almost 100 days in.  Still waiting.
852854308186071040 2017-04-14 12:01:26 UTC <kagleslie> Every stinking day.  The struggle is real.https://twitter.com/matthaig1/status/852751651899195393
852683828548317184 2017-04-13 00:44:01 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @williamlegate The republicans would have lost their minds if President Obama had done something like this.
852683257909059586 2017-04-13 00:41:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @Mike_P_Williams He's worried Putin will release the sex tape
852682698158206978 2017-04-13 00:39:31 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump @crehage Congratulations.  I will, however, miss your replies.
852491066347585536 2017-04-13 11:58:03 UTC <kagleslie> @ARizzo44 Love it!  Congratulations.
852346654665691136 2017-04-12 02:24:12 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Both the increase in jobs and the decrease in illegal immigration are still thanks to the Obama administration.  Nothing to do with you.
852333631259516928 2017-04-12 01:32:27 UTC <kagleslie> It does.  It really really does.  Congrats Cubs.  And from the bottom of my heart, thank you.https://twitter.com/Cubs/status/852304329599893504
852127464000245760 2017-04-12 11:53:13 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 @StephenKing Forrest Trump...I like that.  Thanks.
851769760396324864 2017-04-11 12:11:50 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump you are going to get us all killed.
851767300139208704 2017-04-11 12:02:04 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump This is really not how diplomacy works.  This is not deal making it's just ridiculous.
851586499447590918 2017-04-10 00:03:37 UTC <kagleslie> Well, I will certainly not be flying #unitedAIRLINES @UnitedAirlines ever again.
851435445267333121 2017-04-10 14:03:23 UTC <kagleslie> Still with Her @HillaryClinton #DescribeYourselfInThreeWords
851434778901479424 2017-04-10 14:00:44 UTC <kagleslie> @SecBetsyDeVos That's four words.
851433658426818563 2017-04-10 13:56:17 UTC <kagleslie> yephttps://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/851252629959323650
851259134800306176 2017-04-09 02:22:48 UTC <kagleslie> @crehage I suspect mostly the last one.
850847332589608960 2017-04-08 23:06:26 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You do know that if you have to cheat to win, it isn't really winning, right?
850768104254836736 2017-04-08 17:51:37 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Nice of you to take a break from your golfing to say something.  Also next time ask Congress first.
850186927689129989 2017-04-06 03:22:13 UTC <kagleslie> If @realDonaldTrump really cared about the innocent children in Syria he wouldn't be trying so hard to keep them out of the US. Just saying
850186344722837504 2017-04-06 03:19:54 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei My money is on no.
850148098101972992 2017-04-06 00:47:56 UTC <kagleslie> Obamas travel expenses were $97m over eight years. Trump is already at $23m after 10 weekshttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-travel-expenses-10-weeks-us-taxpayer-fifth-barack-obama-eight-years-mar-a-lago-us-a7670541.html
849960511714230274 2017-04-06 12:22:32 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Once again, these are all due to policies Obama's administration put in place.  Now, the gas attack in Syria, that's all on you.
849807140399271938 2017-04-05 02:13:05 UTC <kagleslie> Yephttps://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/849708477148782592
849243732608262145 2017-04-04 12:54:18 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So children are dying in Syria from a gas attack right now, and you are tweeting about the Drudge Report?  Seriously?
849108965908783104 2017-04-03 03:58:47 UTC <kagleslie> So, Donald are unnamed sources good or bad?  Or does it just depend on your mood?https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/status/848881053309833216
848640237144297483 2017-04-02 20:56:14 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Do you mean the same Republican party that had 7 years to come up with an alternative and STILL couldn't find a better way forward?
848639745802604546 2017-04-02 20:54:17 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I'm more concerned with the content of the leaks personally.  I think that's probably the real story.
848514500353552384 2017-04-02 12:36:36 UTC <kagleslie> It's opening day!  Go Cubs.  Try not to suck.
848276514240114688 2017-04-01 20:50:55 UTC <kagleslie> Yep.https://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/848226485471244289
848242374417539072 2017-04-01 18:35:16 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If you were under surveillance prior to the election, you have bigger problems.  You do know the penalty for treason, right?
848168589546971139 2017-04-01 13:42:04 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump If it's fake why is Flynn asking for immunity?  Just saying... #impeachTrumpnow
848167795191951361 2017-04-01 13:38:55 UTC <kagleslie> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump I really think it is beneath any adult to call other people names.  Grow up.  And start packing your bags. #impeachTrumpnow
848166346659692544 2017-04-01 13:33:09 UTC <kagleslie> April 1.  Trust no one.
847974662533525508 2017-03-31 00:51:28 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump About to be impeached?  Yes very exciting.  I plan to drink Russian vodka while I watch the hearings.  #FlynnFlipped #ImpeachTrump
847974240750063616 2017-03-31 00:49:48 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You are clearly in the last days of your presidency and should not be able to nominate a justice to the Supreme Court.  #impeach
847971552415158272 2017-03-31 00:39:07 UTC <kagleslie> So sad.  RIP sir.https://twitter.com/TwitterMoments/status/847932130982113281
847771968636170241 2017-03-31 11:26:02 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump The lady doth protest too much methinks.  #impeachTrumpnow
847661995537031169 2017-03-30 04:09:03 UTC <kagleslie> Oh the sickening irony.https://twitter.com/HuffingtonPost/status/831467323324297216
847661816691834880 2017-03-30 04:08:20 UTC <kagleslie> @FahrOutMan I would probably be most worried about the third one.
847655343815483392 2017-03-30 03:42:37 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Of course you might not be president anymore next week.  #FlynnFlopped #impeachTrumpnow
847654525586489345 2017-03-30 03:39:22 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Yes I can tell by the way you defunded Planned Parenthood that you really value women.  Way to grab 'em sir.
847283654510354432 2017-03-29 03:05:39 UTC <kagleslie> @GeorgeTakei @MaxineWaters I hope you are right.
847256868942626817 2017-03-29 01:19:13 UTC <kagleslie> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump time to subscribe to the NY Times!
846913794492239872 2017-03-28 02:35:58 UTC <kagleslie> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Deflect deflect deflect.  It won't work.
846711570763857920 2017-03-28 13:12:24 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump this has nothing to do with you.  UAW 2015 contract.  Obama was president then.
846564150369288192 2017-03-27 03:26:36 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump I'm not worried.  The ACA is still in place and you failed.
846563678640099328 2017-03-27 03:24:44 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Deflect all you want.  The truth will out.
846509872669769728 2017-03-27 23:50:55 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 Yay!  Congratulations.  I can't wait to read it.

846106003028557825 2017-03-26 21:06:05 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Not to mention it is not a great day for the environment.
846105918282645504 2017-03-26 21:05:45 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump Yep.  35 permanent jobs.  Not such a great day for American steel though, huh?
846105181448228864 2017-03-26 21:02:49 UTC <kagleslie> Yes @realDonaldTrump Planned Parenthood and Obamacare were saved.  Not by the democrats but by your own party.  Think about that.
846104667796987905 2017-03-26 21:00:47 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You do know the penalty for treason, don't you?
845657436451225600 2017-03-25 15:23:39 UTC <kagleslie> @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Shouldn't you be, I don't know, WORKING instead of plugging fox news?
845657242733072386 2017-03-25 15:22:52 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You failed.  Now go fix the real problem instead of pandering to the insurance companies and big pharma.
845392401896275970 2017-03-24 21:50:29 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So I guess your loss is Planned Parenthood's win.
845392251815690241 2017-03-24 21:49:54 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump You lose.
845391110944034818 2017-03-24 21:45:22 UTC <kagleslie> Hah!https://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/845384537320427521
845324644248883200 2017-03-24 17:21:15 UTC <kagleslie> @SteveKingIA Please vote no on the AHCA.  This is bad for Iowa.
845324228207542277 2017-03-24 17:19:36 UTC <kagleslie> @matthaig1 Good point.
845097064845529089 2017-03-23 02:16:56 UTC <kagleslie> @realDonaldTrump So, is that why they had to postpone the vote?  Because it all so awesome?  I don't think so.
