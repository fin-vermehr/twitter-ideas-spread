971786227404845057 2018-03-08 16:34:26 UTC <MarkGor3455> @RWPUSA @trichardpdx @50inaug I often ponder this point, and I find there was way too much information about Trump to have been conned. Most of them will never admit they were wrong, but they were. And shame on them for not knowing better

941688902728818688 2017-12-15 15:18:24 UTC <MarkGor3455> @chucktodd Another example of the corrosive effect Fox has on discourse in America. Absolute trash!
941442072090779648 2017-12-14 22:57:35 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump @GOP Do people really buy this shit?
940998357471789056 2017-12-13 17:34:25 UTC <MarkGor3455> @GOP Its not any of those things
940956051465048064 2017-12-13 14:46:19 UTC <MarkGor3455> @McTestaInc @Acosta Maybe he should jump off a bridge
940950519459090434 2017-12-13 14:24:20 UTC <MarkGor3455> @NickKristof No, they will not
940665620370198528 2017-12-12 19:32:15 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump Keep believing that if you really do
940453063772405760 2017-12-11 05:27:37 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump @GOP Thank you President Obama!!!!
940452671865077765 2017-12-11 05:26:04 UTC <MarkGor3455> @PressSec @GOP How ironic for you to point that out
940020953605488641 2017-12-10 00:50:34 UTC <MarkGor3455> @SenGillibrand Well at least you have your priorities straight. You got Al Franken out of the senate.
940020528089198592 2017-12-10 00:48:53 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump What about you? You lie 5 times a day with no remorse. At least when media makes an error they correct it.
939881241830047745 2017-12-10 15:35:24 UTC <MarkGor3455> @EdKrassen They call themselves values voters
939880234362421248 2017-12-10 15:31:24 UTC <MarkGor3455> @EdKrassen I guess founders thought people would be smart enough not to elect someone like that, or if they did, electoral college would stop it. Wrong and wrong.
939875935863521281 2017-12-10 15:14:19 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump Thanks to President Obama. He inherited the worst economy in decades and turned it around. All you do is lie.
939517884082020352 2017-12-09 15:31:33 UTC <MarkGor3455> @BillSimmons Given the Marlins performance on and off the field whats a better approach, retaining everyone?

939158326524354560 2017-12-08 15:42:48 UTC <MarkGor3455> @SenGillibrand With friends like you, Franken will never need enemies!!! You showed no integrity going after him. If youre not able to discuss how what Al did is different than Trump or Moore you should resign.
939155395519459329 2017-12-08 15:31:09 UTC <MarkGor3455> @Amy_Siskind Democrats in Senate are cowards. They eat their own and fear GOP

938418580961423361 2017-12-06 14:43:19 UTC <MarkGor3455> @thehill Why would anyone report what she says? Or listen. She is a fountain of obscenity
938417099428335618 2017-12-06 14:37:26 UTC <MarkGor3455> @GOP To all corporations a tax cut, working families get the usual GOP screw job
937343200473128960 2017-12-03 15:30:08 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump @glamourizes Actually its just listening to him that drives the disdain. Much more disturbing are people like you who buy and support his shit
936642987609669633 2017-12-01 17:07:44 UTC <MarkGor3455> @GOP Total bullshit.
936642636516958209 2017-12-01 17:06:21 UTC <MarkGor3455> @GOP But shes being truthful. I realize thats a foreign concept to you guys but deal with it.
935864468138967040 2017-11-29 13:34:11 UTC <MarkGor3455> @EdKrassen But they will blame entitlements and social programs and try to cut them. Its what they always do. Cut taxes, create deficits and blame liberal handouts for the deficits
935698641125220353 2017-11-28 02:35:15 UTC <MarkGor3455> @CharlesMBlow Its Alabama
935183459106021378 2017-11-27 16:28:06 UTC <MarkGor3455> @BillKristol Bill, do you see an objective difference in what these two are accused of? Both are wrong, but hardly the same thing. Shouldnt that matter?
935182128647585792 2017-11-27 16:22:48 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump Good idea but Why leave Fox out? Dont you feel they could handle the scrutiny? Id like to see elected officials subject to the same scrutiny.
934666157675618304 2017-11-25 06:12:31 UTC <MarkGor3455> @thehill Really? Because there was someone making sure banks didnt rip off consumers???

929540592488497152 2017-11-11 02:45:21 UTC <MarkGor3455> @ChrisMurphyCT Almost as bad as stealing the Supreme Court seat. GOP is capable of anything.

826251241802002432 2017-01-30 02:10:21 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump you cabinet picks need vetting. Corrupt people should not be confirmed!!

821600707010826240 2017-01-17 06:10:47 UTC <MarkGor3455> @paulkrugman or the 8 years before that. Republicans never addressed health care in any way while Bush was president.
821599933212004352 2017-01-17 06:07:43 UTC <MarkGor3455> @TheDemocrats She's a billionaire and donates significant amounts to Trump and Republican Senators. What's confusing about this?

821235851644407809 2017-01-16 06:00:59 UTC <MarkGor3455> @voxdotcom @ezraklein That's what con men do. They never deliver.
821009612157554689 2017-01-16 15:01:59 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump Can you name any of the great things he did? Curious how you might view him...
820667085265125376 2017-01-15 16:20:55 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump Wait til they see what you do to their health insurance. Losing!!!! The DONCON!!
820666784567046144 2017-01-15 16:19:43 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump The DON CON, put your name on another's accomplishment. So dishonest!!!

820436867363414016 2017-01-14 01:06:06 UTC <MarkGor3455> But does this reflect any change in perspective among those who voted for him?https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/820305053248536576
820289936284782592 2017-01-14 15:22:15 UTC <MarkGor3455> The payoff!https://twitter.com/thehill/status/820277555324420096
820289316853166085 2017-01-14 15:19:48 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump Prove the claims are false. So corrupt!!!
820169473692839936 2017-01-13 07:23:35 UTC <MarkGor3455> @thehill As if he'll listen.

819759640560865280 2017-01-12 04:15:03 UTC <MarkGor3455> @washingtonpost Trump contradicts Trump.
819633693589262336 2017-01-12 19:54:35 UTC <MarkGor3455> @dcexaminer @GOP will future posts from you all continue in English or in the original Russian text ?
819632188740075520 2017-01-12 19:48:36 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump Midnight vote ...meaningless w/o new plan. I liked your words re Pharma yesterday! Can't wait for substance...
819583151605313537 2017-01-12 16:33:45 UTC <MarkGor3455> @paulkrugman Either way, most of those who voted for him would shrug it off.
819310196107276289 2017-01-11 22:29:07 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump Prove it!! Release your tax returns!!! What are you hiding Donald???? So crooked, such a liar!!!
819309719227486208 2017-01-11 22:27:13 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump So unless US gov't controls media we're like Nazi Germany?? Scary!!!!
819309238333804544 2017-01-11 22:25:19 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realdonald @realDonald ???your electoral total is in the bottom 1/5th of all time, popular vote totals a distant 2nd. So sad you can't accept reality!!
819081518354075649 2017-01-10 07:20:26 UTC <MarkGor3455> @realDonaldTrump Prove it fiction boy. Let's see your tax returns!
818850987779624960 2017-01-10 16:04:23 UTC <MarkGor3455> @thehill no doubt, but let them complete background checks and vetting first!! GOP needs to live up to standards they set.
818846669965926400 2017-01-10 15:47:14 UTC <MarkGor3455> @thehill as usual, she is wrong. HRC talked about it in debates and on campaign trail. Trump dismissed the intelligence reports
818843885195493378 2017-01-10 15:36:10 UTC <MarkGor3455> @GOP bullshit!!!!
818714479793881092 2017-01-09 07:01:57 UTC <MarkGor3455> @MikeSilver If Marino is there I'm saying Namath...
818259388276187136 2017-01-08 00:53:35 UTC <MarkGor3455> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump the content of the report is far more serious!!  And yet you dismiss it. So irresponsible!
