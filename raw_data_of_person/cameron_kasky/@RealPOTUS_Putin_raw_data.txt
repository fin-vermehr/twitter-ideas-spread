For me getting that taking advantage of someone else's trust doesn't make them a "fool" or anything else. It makes them "trusting" The violator of trust has been made UN-worthy of trust or "untrustworthy". I'd rather be trusting than untrustworthy!

A great skill I have learned when people apologize to me is ALWAYS ask them what they are apologizing FOR and then LISTEN.

It's defly easier when you're not using your legit name. Can't wait to get to the stage where I can at least use my face.

958438691235606533 2018-01-30 20:36:05 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @narceducator @NatashaBertrand @Cassizzi Also, focus on ENGAGING with the bots. Not the obvious ones but more the misinformed and malinformed MAGA peeps. Just talk with them and keep your cool. As you dismantle their reasoning they lash out. Ask yourself why someone would lash out
958438211591778305 2018-01-30 20:34:11 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @NatashaBertrand @narceducator @Cassizzi For me, I get myself out of the crazymaking by making everything as simple as possible, then build upwards and outwards. For me this usually looks like comparing the election of Obama and last 8 years of HIM to the last year of 45. Staggering differences, no?

My X always acted quite differently with our daughter than with me but I am concerned about what will happen as my daughter starts to challenge her Mom. That's when all the drama started with me.

For me it centered around how I put myself into the dynamics I got caught up in. Sounds weird but once I got I did it, I could see how I don't ever have to go back into those types of relationships.

For the longest while it was intensely crazymaking and I'd get caught up in it for a solid week. Now, I can hit the breaks in less than 15 minutes. I also am MUCH stronger now. It simply doesn't

957029868058923012 2018-01-26 23:17:55 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> And GOOD http://www.espn.com/espnw/sports/article/22226966/full-usa-gymnastics-board-directors-resign if any were aware of this, let them face charges. It's never ok to look the other way.

956994866785017858 2018-01-26 20:58:51 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @BillKristol What does having us believe this lead us to do? What does it lead #Mueller to do? Many have been talking about how we take to the streets if 45 fires Mueller. Imagine the chaos of that. The threat to national security. What would an autocratic and...
956994377603305472 2018-01-26 20:56:54 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @BillKristol I'm asking myself if there is any value in lying about this. What if 45 never gave such an order? What benefit would there be in making people BELIEVE what we all WANT desperately to believe?
956993995787431940 2018-01-26 20:55:23 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @BillKristol Keep in mind that there have been MANY leaks from this regime.
956993863872327680 2018-01-26 20:54:51 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @BillKristol I wouldn't discount the possibility of another #DeepThroat in all of this. Many people could go down in this investigation. Perhaps someone who KNOWS they are in trouble leaked this so as to be able to say later, "I did what I could"?
956993419502551041 2018-01-26 20:53:05 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @BillKristol Or could have been someone on our side of history. Imagine the intense stress on 45 now. He just said he's down to talk with #Mueller. This comes out and NOW he must be feeling even more heat. It could be using the same "shock" tactic he has been using. Throws him off BIGLY.

956644112115077128 2018-01-25 21:45:04 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> I know I am not the only one who recalls that time not long ago that ALL things Russian were sworn enemies. A mere hint of relation to Russia was an automatic threat.

954102152355606528 2018-01-18 21:24:14 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek I want him to best tested with a test designed to assess cognitive skills. NOT "dementia". I've already explained myself via the 12 tweets you seem to not read or understood.
954101322462236672 2018-01-18 21:20:56 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @fohfuu @BeardedDalek Except that cognitive skills and mental health are internally occuring phenomena.
954100476668243969 2018-01-18 21:17:34 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @fohfuu @BeardedDalek Why has there been an INCREASE in the behavior?
954100343671009281 2018-01-18 21:17:02 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @fohfuu @BeardedDalek The behavior remains the same.
954100250775621632 2018-01-18 21:16:40 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @fohfuu @BeardedDalek Of course it does not change the behavior.
954098954895052806 2018-01-18 21:11:31 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek The 25th is the "Vehicle". What drives it is irrelevant.
954097810768527361 2018-01-18 21:06:59 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek Mental health is indeed not a vehicle for removal in and of itself. I never claimed that it is OR that it ought to be.
954091039446454272 2018-01-18 20:40:04 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek I took a cognitive skills test. It took 6 hours. Many different tests one after another. Like I said, I have MH issues but NO cognitive impairments. I know because I was tested appropriately by a properly trained Psychologist.
954090569730613250 2018-01-18 20:38:12 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek And prep in advance.   Just because he passes the test for dementia doesn't mean he has no deficit in cognitive skills. Even if he didn't download the test he was given, he could have installed the iPhone app for the test to his phone. Or someone could taught him how to answer.
954090070058905607 2018-01-18 20:36:13 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek If someone passes a screening test for dementia, it can be assumed they may not have dementia. Assuming of course that he didn't download the one page test from the internet like I didpic.twitter.com/H1lMMOSnOy
954089808128770048 2018-01-18 20:35:11 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek If the gas guage suggests the tank is full, then the reason the car won't start could still be related to the fuel system.
954089610753306624 2018-01-18 20:34:23 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek A test for if not having gas is causing the car to not start is to look at the gas guage. A test for impaired cognitive skills is a screening test for dementia.
954089263154556933 2018-01-18 20:33:01 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek The car not starting is a "symptom". Having questionable cognitive skills is a symptom.
954088982358515712 2018-01-18 20:31:54 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek But a patient can have cognitive impairments and NOT have dementia. Think of it this way, a car won't start. Does that mean it is out of gas? No. It could be any number of things that cause the car not to start.
954088732134707200 2018-01-18 20:30:54 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @KeenanPowell6 @BeardedDalek This would look like taking neurologic and psychiatric evaluations instead of a screening test for dementia. Dementia is a disease process that can impair cognitive skills.
954088233092206592 2018-01-18 20:28:55 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @fohfuu @BeardedDalek Why lie about one's height and weight?
954088156420243458 2018-01-18 20:28:37 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @fohfuu @BeardedDalek Yet, there has been an incredible increase in traffic regarding his height and weight. Why? Because both are part of the calculation of BMI. BMI is one way of assessing obesity. Obesity is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
954087752173277184 2018-01-18 20:27:00 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell @fohfuu @BeardedDalek It is about the dishonesty. If it we're about being fat, there'd have been no increase in criticism about his being fat. He did not suddenly gain weight once the information was released.

954027896598925312 2018-01-18 16:29:10 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sarahhollowell Making fun of a man for lying is different than making fun of a man for being fat. Nothing "funny" about being overweight and NOT something to make fun of. Calling out lying as it is happening is a life skill.

953480136065798145 2018-01-16 04:12:33 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @TPM A legit "Neuropsychological Exam" has to be done by a qualified examiner and can take from 6-8 hours to complete. The test 45 took is ONE PAGE LONG and takes 10+ minutes.pic.twitter.com/oSMAhORZxH
953479568454815744 2018-01-16 04:10:18 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @NBCNews Download a copy of the cognitive test and practice taking it. Or, download the app and take it there. Then, once you know all the answers, you too can be a "stable genius"!
953479175670726656 2018-01-16 04:08:44 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @thinkprogress Anyone could have given him the answers to the test before he actually took it. He could have taken it many times so he didn't forget the answers.
953478968656760832 2018-01-16 04:07:55 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @thinkprogress There is even an iPhone app for the test. It takes a little more than 10 minutes to take the test contrary to what the Doc said.
953478735902199808 2018-01-16 04:07:00 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @thinkprogress Talk about that cognitive test they gave him then. One page. You can download a copy of it now and take it for yourself.
953478444180000769 2018-01-16 04:05:50 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @TPM I had a neuropsychological evaluation done recently and it was a full day of tests. TESTS; as in plural. The examiner had multiple books he used to administer it. There was no "prepping" for it. Felt like finals week once done!
953477933598945280 2018-01-16 04:03:48 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @TPM It's a ONE page test that takes a little more than 10 minutes to take. Go to the tests website. It's a joke.
953477724890456069 2018-01-16 04:02:59 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @TPM That cognitive exam is easily and freely downloadable. Anyone could download it and get coached on the answers. There's also an iPhone app for the test.

933104045283090432 2017-11-21 22:45:15 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @sbhennops Facebook is not a reliable source. It is a link, but not an actual source of news. It's like asking someone to believe what I say and then telling them the proof  is in a comic book.

It's as if they lack the skills to comprehend how much wrong they have done? Like significant cognitive and emotional impairments that make them incapable of seeing any of it?

930936966882955264 2017-11-15 23:14:03 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @VonnieCalland Agreed! We need to destigmatize it first as well as destigmatize the underlying issues as well. Thought like emotional / mental health! People many times turn to drugs as a means to self medicate for MH issues.

If those who have acted in ways that require a visit to the penitentiary become penitent, is there valid reason to keep them locked away from the rest of humanity?
930145465542291457 2017-11-13 18:48:54 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @HillaryClinton @AlanDersh @DebraMessing @stevlucas Same with ANY law that has been broken or bent beyond recognition. Own the "error" if it IS an error, and then clean up the mess left behind. Kudos for that, punishment for hiding it.
930145170624040960 2017-11-13 18:47:44 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @HillaryClinton @AlanDersh @DebraMessing @stevlucas And for me, much of my ire is not about what is or has been done, but the extent to which many go to deny or obscure what has been done. If for example, any famous person did indeed sexually assault someone, simply admit to it, and do the right thing rather than try and hide it.

929194504669794304 2017-11-10 03:50:08 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @AlanDersh @DebraMessing @stevlucas Did they ever find charges to file against @HillaryClinton? If so, then you might have a point. If not then your point may not be as valid as your want it to be.
929193386720055296 2017-11-10 03:45:41 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @AlanDersh @DebraMessing @stevlucas I dunno. If a libel or slander case is one, damages are awarded based on the degree of reputation. Also, the government has already grilled @HillaryClinton , spent lots of taxpayer money, found nothing worthy of indicting over and NO damage settlement yet.
929108609136513027 2017-11-10 22:08:49 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @AlanDersh @DebraMessing @stevlucas And FINDING charges is extremely different than being found guilty. Don't get me wrong; charges alone can destroy someone's reputation. Hence libel and slander laws.
929108295411003392 2017-11-10 22:07:34 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @AlanDersh @DebraMessing @stevlucas True and indeed something to be on guard about. That being said, being found guilty of a crime does not mean a crime wasn't committed. This too is something to be on guard about.

Our justice system is based upon this. INNOCENT until PROVEN guilty. Also all of science is based upon this as well. Look at "Null Hypothesis" for example.
929002227238363136 2017-11-10 15:06:05 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @AlanDersh @DebraMessing @stevlucas Or to bring this home, one of your sons tells you another of your sons is gay. Does that mean one of your sons is gay?

928616167404695552 2017-11-09 13:32:01 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @DebraMessing @stevlucas So because @AlanDersh says that @AlanDersh is correct, @AlanDersh is indeed, correct? Got it. Thanks for taking the time to explain that.

928575560921632768 2017-11-09 10:50:40 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> Yes, this seems to be a thing...https://twitter.com/Ghostwheel12/status/923069080344694784
928575429006512128 2017-11-09 10:50:09 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> When YOU say "genocide" what do YOU mean?
928574060015050752 2017-11-09 10:44:42 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @SenMikeLee I'm confusedsky. First the lid on the bottle says OPIOID, not whatever you wrote. Second, opioids don't hurt people; people hurt people.https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee/status/927563415194923008
928316883866193921 2017-11-08 17:42:47 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Good to know! PLENTY of ranges around me.
928271597382914048 2017-11-08 14:42:49 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Honestly, I've been seriously interested in going to a range to shoot! I haven't shot a real gun (other than a BB gun) since I was a KID, lol. I've heard it's an EXPENSIVE hobby?
928271308063985665 2017-11-08 14:41:40 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ I never thought of it that way! It DOES scare the crap out of me and now that you mention it, in my mind, that fear DOES then transfer to handguns. Interesting...I'm not at all opposed to open carry with greater regulations and SMALLER guns.
928103415653257216 2017-11-07 03:34:32 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @JoyAnnReid Not to mention ENDING @GovChristie legacy!!
928102732598251525 2017-11-07 03:31:49 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ So, how do you feel about open carry of rifles vs. handguns?
928102045571256320 2017-11-07 03:29:05 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Trust me....I know.
928101712791031808 2017-11-07 03:27:46 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ There's plenty of money but who would ever agree to using it for something that might percent them from getting guns?
928101221755482113 2017-11-07 03:25:49 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ And if we deny soldiers with MH issues from guns knowing that military service can cause MH issues, will people continue to enlist knowing they may no longer be able to own guns once out?
928100877835145218 2017-11-07 03:24:27 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Not saying that is a "bad thing" just saying that I'd we are going to take that approach, then this could get tricky.
928100548984918016 2017-11-07 03:23:08 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Well, then you have parents who may not get their kids the care they need so that they don't get flagged later in life. So again, these kids who ought to get care and up unstable and with guns.
928089614509924352 2017-11-07 02:39:41 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ I voice texted that Tweet. I think I was pointing out that if we ban those with MH issues from gun ownership, less people will seek care they need so they can still get guns. Result will be ppl with MH illness without treatment but with guns.
928088991307587584 2017-11-07 02:37:13 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Agreed
928088881098035200 2017-11-07 02:36:46 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Correct research shows the mentally ill late not likely to be victims of crime than perps of crime. So keeping guns away from them more likely to hurt them than likelihood of them hurting another.
928088384991649792 2017-11-07 02:34:48 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Background checks have actually stopped people who already legally cannot buy guns! Imagine if they were mandatory with every guy purchase!!!
928052905025916928 2017-11-07 00:13:49 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @1MAGACarole @JaniceTXBlessed @schaefermp So whatchya think aboutpic.twitter.com/mT2NvA7j6N
928052526380920833 2017-11-07 00:12:19 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @1MAGACarole @JaniceTXBlessed @schaefermp Investigate a PICTURE? Lord help us.
928051826414505985 2017-11-07 00:09:32 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> I hate when people try arguing that appearing in a picture with someone makes them guilty of something. It's idiotic when people do it to 45 too.https://twitter.com/JaniceTXBlessed/status/928025202658865153
928051313493053440 2017-11-07 00:07:30 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ And yes, FELONY crimes are today different animal.
928051217917505538 2017-11-07 00:07:07 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ I don't know...We as a nation have a dark history of taking people's rights away. I could see a temporary block but not at all sure the NRA would ever approve even that.
928050703288893441 2017-11-07 00:05:04 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ What do you mean?
928050543813189633 2017-11-07 00:04:26 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ I can see what your other points are though that CONVICTIONS for harassment, stalking, abuse might be worth taking a GOOD LOOK at. As in Domestic Abuse for example
928050174928326657 2017-11-07 00:02:58 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Not allowing people with mental health disorders to own a gun could put them at a disadvantage in protecting themselves.
928049961664765953 2017-11-07 00:02:07 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ The last hard part of any discussion regarding mental health and guns is that recent research suggests that people with mental health issues are more likely to be victims of crime then perpetrators of crime.
928049640796278785 2017-11-07 00:00:51 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ So by bar and people who have been to a mental hospital from gun ownership we could be creating tons of people we're not getting the care they need who now have guns.
928049385342193665 2017-11-07 23:59:50 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ If they don't get treated then some of these people with these diagnoses could very well become unstable.
928049195071754240 2017-11-07 23:59:05 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ What many people will do is not get treated or not seek care because they would be afraid of not being able to own a gun.
928049092630122497 2017-11-07 23:58:40 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ People can be in a mental hospital for anxiety depression PTSD OCD bipolar disorder Etc
928048974493347847 2017-11-07 23:58:12 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Anxiety and depression are also Mental illnesses.
928048851709321216 2017-11-07 23:57:43 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ PTSD stands for post-traumatic stress disorder. It is a mental illness.
928048710063357952 2017-11-07 23:57:09 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ How many soldiers returning home after fighting overseas would also be denied access to gun ownership because of PTSD
928048260455026689 2017-11-07 23:55:22 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ And if we started doing psychological testing on anyone who is going to use a gun a lot of police officers would end up losing their jobs because of PTSD.
928048030124793856 2017-11-07 23:54:27 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Gets a little tricky with the mental institution. People go to mental institutions for a variety of reasons. Not all of which would mean they shouldn't own a gun.
928046721816547328 2017-11-07 23:49:15 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ You keep saying it's the unstable people. The problem is the first sign of instability can be a massacre and then it's too late.
928046223185137669 2017-11-07 23:47:16 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ I see what you are saying but again how do we assess whether or not someone is stable. We cannot ask and even during actual testing, people can lie. Just ask my X-Wife 
928044879468486658 2017-11-07 23:41:56 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> Is he literally trying to pass a law already passed?https://twitter.com/JeffFlake/status/927981723853426690

928043478860419072 2017-11-07 23:36:22 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @MartinHeinrich @JeffFlake #NotEnough
928008017852985344 2017-11-07 21:15:27 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Which means poorer people may never be able to buy guns.
928007918804488193 2017-11-07 21:15:04 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ If you can afford the legal fees, that is. If you cannot pay for the expungement, then those crimes don't ever go away.
928007737610555397 2017-11-07 21:14:20 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ And with the expungement process, many charges can be 'erased' from checks.
928007585445400577 2017-11-07 21:13:44 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ They might catch crimes someone has committed and gotten caught for but not crimes not caught.
928007424409206786 2017-11-07 21:13:06 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ I've undergone those and have never seen anything that assesses mental stability. Literally nothing but where I've lived, SSN, and other basic demographic information. No medical information or assessment in the 4 or so I've undergone.
928006976738611205 2017-11-07 21:11:19 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Me too. What are your thoughts about having them everywhere? As in gun shows, private sell, etc?
928006725105606657 2017-11-07 21:10:19 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @The_Real_Leigh_ Why? You seem like a smart person. Care to take a guess?
927995780849455107 2017-11-07 20:26:50 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @AlanDersh If not then our legal system is truly f***** and Harvard must be a very scary scary place
927995673546575873 2017-11-07 20:26:24 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @AlanDersh As a lawyer I'm sure you understand the concept that thing something doesn't make it true.

927994468468486144 2017-11-07 20:21:37 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> What is the total death count to date, from mass murder by car? What is the total death count to date from mass murder by gun? By knife?https://twitter.com/The_Real_Leigh_/status/927569174116827139
927993913285148678 2017-11-07 20:19:24 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> Are you okay with regulating guns for safety? What about allowing the government to study them?https://twitter.com/The_Real_Leigh_/status/927569174116827139
927993797174317059 2017-11-07 20:18:57 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> Cars are very well regulated and monitored for safety. They are also very well studied by the government.https://twitter.com/The_Real_Leigh_/status/927569174116827139
927993352565469184 2017-11-07 20:17:11 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> Can we just drop the the last time I checked bit? It is much easier to kill more people more quickly with an assault rifle than a knife.https://twitter.com/The_Real_Leigh_/status/927569174116827139
927993158234988553 2017-11-07 20:16:24 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> @GeorgeTakei @NergieGruntfutt @The_Real_Leigh_ Right. Last time I checked... Can we just drop the last time bit? It is much easier to kill more with assault
927992792860758016 2017-11-07 20:14:57 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> And hey thank you for not carrying an assault rifle.https://twitter.com/The_Real_Leigh_/status/927581646274154496
927992685297881088 2017-11-07 20:14:32 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> I think it'd be a great idea to take guns away from unstable people but how do we determine who is stable and who is not?https://twitter.com/The_Real_Leigh_/status/927581646274154496
927992270309281792 2017-11-07 20:12:53 UTC <RealPOTUS_Putin> Totally agree! Which is why I think every nation should have nuclear weapons.https://twitter.com/Jammin_Aces/status/927574113165758465
