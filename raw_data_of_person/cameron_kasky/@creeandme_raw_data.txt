970419299511828480 2018-03-04 22:02:45 UTC <creeandme> @merseysey I read your tweets. I just don't know which Bill you're specifically referring to. I don't want to make you keep face palming. I will find it on my own.
970408881229844482 2018-03-04 21:21:21 UTC <creeandme> @merseysey Unless there's a separate one than the one I'm aware of. And that is entirely possible. There are a lot of moving parts and absolutely could be discussing a different one.
970408648454352896 2018-03-04 21:20:25 UTC <creeandme> @merseysey But if you're using the bill to point out her specifications that's his bill as well.
970404534110576640 2018-03-04 21:04:04 UTC <creeandme> @merseysey But I do sincerely hope that it's continues to be the goal. I just get nervous anytime I see someone being vague. Slippery slope and all.

963432329531228160 2018-02-13 15:19:01 UTC <creeandme> @AKimCampbell @rosen_deborah I don't think a sleeveless dress is sexualized. But maybe we should also stop using sexuality as a way to put women on the defensive. There was a time when ankles, elbows, knees were spoken about in this way.
963425307540770817 2018-02-13 14:51:07 UTC <creeandme> @AKimCampbell I did. And I stand by my original statement. I hope a person can be taken seriously but communicating there knowledge and content.
963414321710628864 2018-02-13 14:07:28 UTC <creeandme> @AKimCampbell I think dismissing women because of their outfits undermines credibility and gravitas. Wouldn't it be nice if credibility could be weighed by the content of one's work rather than their apparel?

897090271699193857 2017-08-14 13:39:22 UTC <creeandme> @PeterLerangis @BSCCPodcast Thanks for being one of my favorite diversions every week. ESPECIALLY needed this week!  #ATXBabyBees  #BSCC 
896923823735525377 2017-08-13 02:37:58 UTC <creeandme> @mileskahn Congratulations!!

896477797979480064 2017-08-12 21:05:37 UTC <creeandme> @MortuaryReport @tbhanson @WTBDavidG What point exactly are you wanting to dispute? What is the thing that you are challenging as not being legitimate?
896477553246044162 2017-08-12 21:04:39 UTC <creeandme> @MortuaryReport @tbhanson @WTBDavidG It's not accepting it because they are minority it's accepting it because it is personally their life experience
896473472939040768 2017-08-12 20:48:26 UTC <creeandme> @larrywilmore You got a webcam? Let's do this!
896473175097135104 2017-08-12 20:47:15 UTC <creeandme> @MortuaryReport @tbhanson I see endless examples of people offering education in this thread. Sharing stories of how these experiences make them feel.
896472542432645120 2017-08-12 20:44:44 UTC <creeandme> @MortuaryReport @WTBDavidG @tbhanson You seem to feel that the acceptance we are talking about means people have to accept any treatment that is dumped on them. False conclusion
896471823256133632 2017-08-12 20:41:52 UTC <creeandme> @MortuaryReport @WTBDavidG @tbhanson And your whole premise of denying an educational conversation is flawed. Saying this kind of interrogation is intrusive is education.
896471688669483009 2017-08-12 20:41:20 UTC <creeandme> @MortuaryReport @WTBDavidG @tbhanson Having a conversation on a public forum means the public gets involved. This is not a private conversation in a restaurant booth.
896466538206605312 2017-08-12 20:20:52 UTC <creeandme> @MortuaryReport @WTBDavidG @tbhanson Asks why don't you educate. Receives an answer. Uses a belittling statement. Plays nice guy victim card.

896366161079783424 2017-08-12 13:42:01 UTC <creeandme> @joshgondelman @sssssparkers Glad he fixed it. That's how it read to me but I didn't see where it, would go that would change the meaning.

896363508388048896 2017-08-12 13:31:28 UTC <creeandme> @joshgondelman You're about to gain a very different following.
896363262073327617 2017-08-12 13:30:29 UTC <creeandme> @joshgondelman @sssssparkers How? Where would it go that would change the sentiment? I've only been awake for a couple minutes so I may be missing it.

894618318576988160 2017-08-07 17:56:43 UTC <creeandme> @MarkGoulston @bcerda7267 I'm curious about the research going into this. Addictive behaviors often have a genetic cause. Nature and nurture factor in.
893997661455515649 2017-08-05 00:50:26 UTC <creeandme> @TomBodett I don't think you have to worry about that. That was 2015. The con is no longer on. We legitimately go to conventions now.
893866037921419265 2017-08-05 16:07:25 UTC <creeandme> @TomBodett @fartdarth @PattenPending Nobody likes to talk about the fact that Felicity had an alternate Dimension. But I think it's important.

892893458481938432 2017-08-02 23:42:44 UTC <creeandme> @BrianKarem I think questioning authority is how we got a president instead of a king in the first place.

892698116138336256 2017-08-02 10:46:31 UTC <creeandme> @necrocrunk @OrganisedPauper @Eremitpurpur I meant saying I am autistic still leaves it as a adjective plf uses it as a noun.
892696965217214464 2017-08-02 10:41:56 UTC <creeandme> @OrganisedPauper I misread what you answered and had tweeted something previously that was irrelevant. I should not tweet within 5 minutes of waking up.
892695578735497216 2017-08-02 10:36:26 UTC <creeandme> @necrocrunk @OrganisedPauper @Eremitpurpur It has to do with the part of speech autism or another trait becomes full stop.

778575224295952384 2016-09-21 12:42:53 UTC <creeandme> @KrockkH @DeepSouthProud Source? That varies dramatically from what I'm finding in research from law enforcement agencies.
778573609891532800 2016-09-21 12:36:28 UTC <creeandme> @DeepSouthProud @VisionPoet @Kevaroo Because the issue is the indiscriminate use of lethal force by police.

776232089649688577 2016-09-14 01:32:06 UTC <creeandme> No one who doesn't already fall for anything he says. And most of them didn't know about Flint in the first place.
776230602559283200 2016-09-14 01:26:11 UTC <creeandme> @catvoncat Plus taking it in and out of hairbands increases hair breakage/ fall out. We should be the consultants! 
776230265748197376 2016-09-14 01:24:51 UTC <creeandme> No. Now they are using it as campaign fodder.
776229322487062529 2016-09-14 01:21:06 UTC <creeandme> @catvoncat Right? Or just style it up for the entire show.

775426712054013952 2016-09-12 20:11:49 UTC <creeandme> the Dallas shooter is dead. Those police officers still have jobs with no criminal charges.
775426602649780224 2016-09-12 20:11:23 UTC <creeandme> in Dallas was an assassination by a single person. Not a police shooting by officers still employed.

755647825271218176 2016-07-19 06:17:35 UTC <creeandme> My kingdom for an edit button on Twitter. So many typos in my tweets tonight. #sleepytweeting
755645713862844416 2016-07-19 06:09:12 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket it doesn't have to be an argument it can just be an exchange.
755645612297715713 2016-07-19 06:08:47 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket I'm always going to choose to err on the side of being loving. If someone is hurt I'm going to choose to respect that.
755645454302470144 2016-07-19 06:08:10 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket it's not my place to decide if their hurt is justified
755645109409026048 2016-07-19 06:06:47 UTC <creeandme> we are ending it because we are disagreeing on what counts as racism.
755644761650896896 2016-07-19 06:05:25 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket keep an open mind to other people's side of things and keep talking with respect. Goodnight
755644503961309192 2016-07-19 06:04:23 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket exposure to diversity is the best education on what is inclusive and what is exclusionary.
755644368577527808 2016-07-19 06:03:51 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket I feel like you need it to be violence or a direct statement of hate and it's so much more complex than that
755644233420275713 2016-07-19 06:03:19 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket I am surrounded by liberal people and I don't know anybody who doesn't believe their words have consequences
755643875528761345 2016-07-19 06:01:53 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket I didn't say you were demeaning I said that term is often used to demean. It's off-putting in a circumstance like this.
755643533382586368 2016-07-19 06:00:32 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket fits* not this.
755643064543313920 2016-07-19 05:58:40 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket another blanket statement. And I just went back to the hashtag almost everything I saw this under the category of racism
755642633586966532 2016-07-19 05:56:57 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket I do appreciate you being open to talk about this in a respectful way.
755642452925620224 2016-07-19 05:56:14 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket but it's often used against the marginalized group to demean their stance
755642227225989121 2016-07-19 05:55:20 UTC <creeandme> I'm more mad at myself that I'm being baited. At least he's not just slinging hate speech.
755641778590613506 2016-07-19 05:53:33 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket Free Speech does not protect you from social consequences.
755641619831980033 2016-07-19 05:52:55 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket and his words matter. He is a representative of the people and said something infuriating. And people are furious
755641129169747969 2016-07-19 05:50:58 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket but you made a blanket statement using the term "you people". You did not call out specific sweet as being trivial
755639119863222272 2016-07-19 05:42:59 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket I meant to put the word attention at the front of that second tweet
755639037520646144 2016-07-19 05:42:40 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket who is sitting elected official who implied that all the greatest accomplishments of the world we're done by caucasians
755638725409931264 2016-07-19 05:41:25 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket it's satire. And a trending hashtag. Some are going to be more relevant and effective than others. It was meant to bring
755637841871372288 2016-07-19 05:37:55 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket not even a little while we were talking about
755637457765404672 2016-07-19 05:36:23 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket I believe she was saying goodbye because you mentioned deleting people from the thread
755636567767715840 2016-07-19 05:32:51 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket I'm more comfortable in a public space.
755634963232464896 2016-07-19 05:26:28 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket Sure.
755633907287064576 2016-07-19 05:22:17 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket but it was the purpose of the hashtag which you deemed overly sensitive.
755625129841917952 2016-07-19 04:47:24 UTC <creeandme> @JohnRossBowie @FaustMN Now that's all I can see. 
755620518947061760 2016-07-19 04:29:05 UTC <creeandme> @justinkirkland4 I always thought Lucy was working with candy. Imagining those as the crap of this campaign puts a sickening spin on this.
755618670953377793 2016-07-19 04:21:44 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket it can't hurt to look at the source material. It's dumbfounding.
755601769896390656 2016-07-19 03:14:35 UTC <creeandme> @number1catch Or more sincerely this surgeon.http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20160715-parkland-doctors-candid-words-resonated-with-black-professionals.ece
755600892603224065 2016-07-19 03:11:05 UTC <creeandme> @number1catch doc McStuffins!
755525943175688194 2016-07-19 22:13:16 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket I agree. What King said was fairly irrational
755525677621714944 2016-07-19 22:12:13 UTC <creeandme> @Classyjacket and we have the right to criticize your criticism
755525043535302656 2016-07-19 22:09:42 UTC <creeandme> @Brandi_Webber no apologies necessary. I'm from Texas. I get it.  Also a lot of the commenters in this thread are monsters.
755522279103094784 2016-07-19 21:58:42 UTC <creeandme> @BreitbartNews @Kim13283440 read the comments in this thread and think about being on the receiving end of them.
755522175340163072 2016-07-19 21:58:18 UTC <creeandme> @BreitbartNews @Kim13283440 because coming out about sexual harassment or assault is a nightmare for the victim.
755496853626458112 2016-07-19 20:17:41 UTC <creeandme> @weird4 "and I feel..." cut to blood-curdling screams.

755230743270264832 2016-07-18 02:40:15 UTC <creeandme> @youngsinick just Pence. Trump will answer for him.
755230435072815104 2016-07-18 02:39:01 UTC <creeandme> @mic but there's no escape from reality. Plus I keep expecting him to bust through that like the Biggest Loser finale. Did he? I can't watch
755228261374763009 2016-07-18 02:30:23 UTC <creeandme> @FrankConniff @ConfidenceOfVic that's why they had to correct the system in season 7.
755228046077026304 2016-07-18 02:29:32 UTC <creeandme> @FrankConniff @MaxwellMercy so is Melania or Mike Pence Faith in this story?
754838461731868672 2016-07-17 00:41:28 UTC <creeandme> @badtweethunter @Amina1943 Yes! This!

754736269943447553 2016-07-17 17:55:23 UTC <creeandme> on this we agree.

754733975092899841 2016-07-17 17:46:16 UTC <creeandme> it's good that you're being an advocate for everyone. I appreciate you speaking up for investigation in all of these killings.

751282409534918656 2016-07-07 05:10:59 UTC <creeandme> @michaeljohns so it would be too sweeping but you're going to do it anyway?
751280941054595072 2016-07-07 05:05:09 UTC <creeandme> @JDDunlapTX that is a fringe element saying that and by no means the sentiment of the black lives matter movement.
751277976252133376 2016-07-07 04:53:22 UTC <creeandme> @RitaPanahi Putting him at risk in a volatile situation deserves response. That doesn't mean that people are not horrified by the shootings.
