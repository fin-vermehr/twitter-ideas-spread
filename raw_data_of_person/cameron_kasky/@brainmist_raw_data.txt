For that, we need voters smart enough to insist on such politicians.  And, as we've seen, they're not.

965665774336659458 2018-02-19 19:13:56 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @MsPackyetti @MidoriOCD @Pertermann_arch @Jeffersonian9 Frankly, as an admirer of much of Jefferson's philosophy and rhetoric (while still recognizing that he was nonetheless a slave owner who probably raped at least one slave), I can't imagine he'd find your weak arguments complimentary or respectful.

He was just one working within a culture where systematic abuse of humans was the standard for himself & his peers. But you can't bear to accept that, because it would tarnish his image!

In your article that you picked because it supports your point, you think. Out of how many scholastic reviews?  Meanwhile, note none of them contesting the DNA evidence which confirms rather a lot more solidly than opinion that a Jefferson raped Hemings.

963148234637025280 2018-02-12 20:30:08 UTC <brainmist> @Atrios But Millennials mark the inarguable end of anything that could be considered "youth" for Boomers, and their previously uncontested reign as Biggest/Most Powerful Gen.  So they're unconsciously, consistently pushing back against that adulthood to stave off a shifting of power.

But we see this response when abuse is reported of "Look at all the good he's done, society has overall benefited". And that belief leads to turning a blind eye or even suppressing reports of abuse, because the abuser has value.

If we're looking at humanity's overall benefit making up for abuse, it decidedly opens the door.  Approx 100 people died in Nazi hypothermia experiments. How many were saved as a result? If it's 10,000, is that enough to negate the abuse?

962838748844232704 2018-02-11 00:00:21 UTC <brainmist> @whmullally @JoeyCarl01 @petejohansson @crimsonhotmess If you reported the person who abused you, and family, friends, and authorities started listing all the great things he did for you and your community, would that in any way make up for the abuse?
962836149898240000 2018-02-11 23:50:01 UTC <brainmist> @whmullally @JoeyCarl01 @petejohansson @crimsonhotmess They're examples of people for whom the response to reports of abuse has included a listing of their perceived merits and value as a counter, and as a reason reports of abuse should be ignored, or even silenced.
962829898124587008 2018-02-11 23:25:10 UTC <brainmist> This really didn't seem like it should be controversial. I know, our modern world is rife with examples of privileged/valued abusers being shielded from consequences.  But I thought there was general understanding that this protection from consequences for gain was wrong.https://twitter.com/brainmist/status/962739945843683328
962823333938163712 2018-02-11 22:59:05 UTC <brainmist> @ChurchofSatan "your assumptions outweigh decades of academic and historical texts on the subject" seems to be the predominant religion these days.
962822492959268870 2018-02-11 22:55:45 UTC <brainmist> @whmullally @JoeyCarl01 @petejohansson @crimsonhotmess I'd debate that. But regardless, how does it offset abuse? Why is this somehow seen as something which can be traded on in determining how we'll deal with reported abuse?  We see it over and over. Roy Moore, Al Franken, Brock Turner, Donald Trump. But how is that acceptable?
962818865574096897 2018-02-11 22:41:20 UTC <brainmist> Wow. Read this. He hasn't even finished. I'm waiting on each tweet.https://twitter.com/JShahryar/status/962809123824742400

The horror stories of women in STEM are awful in and of themselves, but in an objective calculation of human advancement, also represent substantial lost, suppressed, obstructed, deterred potential. It continues because so often a known abuser is considered too valuable.
962809003104460801 2018-02-11 22:02:09 UTC <brainmist> @whmullally @JoeyCarl01 @petejohansson @crimsonhotmess I'm not arguing the degree of his accomplishments or his abuse. I'm saying that the former doesn't offset the latter, and that responding to reports of abuse by citing accomplishments or claiming net societal gain reinforces the idea that perceived value does offset abusiveness.

And yet when a report of abuse is made, there's always some response of "but look how X has benefited society!" as if that changes the situation. It doesn't. #SocietalGainDoesNotOffsetAbuse

962788085737115648 2018-02-11 20:39:02 UTC <brainmist> @whmullally @JoeyCarl01 Abusers know that, if their relative worth, whether fame, power, money, whatever, is deemed higher than their victims', society will not only give them a pass, it will actively assist in silencing victims. That will continue until we stop allowing perceived worth to offset abuse.
962786596285308928 2018-02-11 20:33:06 UTC <brainmist> @whmullally @JoeyCarl01 You can recognize that he's accomplished things. Just also recognize that these accomplishments do not in any way cancel out abuse.  And that elevating him by focusing on his accomplishments in response to reports of abuse suggests that, somehow, they do cancel out.
962778449868918784 2018-02-11 20:00:44 UTC <brainmist> @whmullally @JoeyCarl01 @MassivRuss Exactly, and excellent example. That there are identifiable positive outcomes that owe their roots to slavery in no way lessens or offsets the atrocity of slavery.

Nazi research on hypothermia. The Tuskegee syphilis experiment.  We do not look at these things and say "I just think if you accurately weigh the advances..."  We say "atrocity". The rest has no bearing.

It doesn't matter. There is no societal gain that offsets abuse.

It's why the abused don't come forward. And abusers know this.
962750856100765696 2018-02-11 18:11:05 UTC <brainmist> @whmullally @JoeyCarl01 @petejohansson Nor does it make it less accurate. However, it does remind those tired of fighting assholes that plenty of us are still in the fight. It's never really about YOU, sweetie.

959711357741477888 2018-02-03 08:53:12 UTC <brainmist> You're no racist, of course, but they're brown, and somehow fair treatment of them would diminish you. You're no racist, of course, you just expect to be treated better. For reasons.  You're no racist! And it's unfair that people conclude, from your words and actions, you are.
959709494916902912 2018-02-03 08:45:48 UTC <brainmist> But you, who benefit from their labor that provides food and services, who benefit from their taxes that support schools, who benefit from their investment in your community... You object to them having rights. And education. And access to medical care. And food. And homes.
959708655565369344 2018-02-03 08:42:28 UTC <brainmist> These people who worked and invested and educated and bought and, heavens forbid! ate, have some minimal expectations. They'd like to be treated like people, not indentured servants. They expect to have rights. They'd like to have citizenship.
959707784500666368 2018-02-03 08:39:00 UTC <brainmist> They enroll their kids in schools which you grumble constantly about supporting, but which are somehow YOURS ALONE if someone else wants to use them.

959706800361746432 2018-02-03 08:35:06 UTC <brainmist> They draw money from banks. It's money they deposited, earned by working, possibly growing the food you claim as your own, possibly providing the medical services you so jealously hoard.

959705832555458561 2018-02-03 08:31:15 UTC <brainmist> They go to doctors, and, while surely on some level you knew you weren't the doctors' only patient, I mean, you saw other people in the waiting room, somehow it's now an imposition, because THESE people are brown, and discuss their concerns with each other in another language.
959705149349531648 2018-02-03 08:28:32 UTC <brainmist> They eat food. They bought it at the grocery store. There's no food shortage in America, largely because of the hard work of immigrant farmers. But apparently that was YOUR food. ALL YOURS.  And the groceries they bought from the store full of food somehow are stolen from YOU.

959483154376609792 2018-02-02 17:46:24 UTC <brainmist> @RWReagan1 Cite me an article that declares the dossier has been proven "bogus", or that the investigation had been proven unfounded. And then cite sources to verify that there are no Russian bots active on Twitter, much less bots sourced to Russia boosting Trump and Trump favorable tweets.
959477588744982528 2018-02-02 17:24:18 UTC <brainmist> @RWReagan1 Yeah, that's pretty much what I expected. Did you, by any chance, evaluate your source at all before accepting it because you wanted the content to be true?
959470633615798272 2018-02-02 16:56:39 UTC <brainmist> @RWReagan1 The sad thing is, I'd think YOU would care. Didn't you claim to serve? And don't you apparently think Reagan was worthy of emulation?

959114845114241024 2018-02-01 17:22:53 UTC <brainmist> @EverydaySexism @Muireann_Irish @CharStamper I've watched women hide their bumps as long as possible, knowing that potential employers and even colleagues would view their pregnancy with career-damaging disapproval. And I've watched that subtle and not-so-subtle condemnation come from professional women, some with children.
959114287322226691 2018-02-01 17:20:40 UTC <brainmist> @EverydaySexism @Muireann_Irish @CharStamper In a conversation about being a woman in STEM, or even in academia?  Of COURSE it's relevant! One of the harshest presumptions is that a woman can't be a mother and also career-driven...something men rarely face.

956256047341166592 2018-01-24 20:03:02 UTC <brainmist> 13/ It happened because you didn't think it could hurt you, and you didn't care if it hurt others. Hell, you LIKED that it hurt OTHERS.  It happened because this was the world you voted for. This was the world YOU WANTED.  And, damn you, you took us all with you. /end rant
956254264573210630 2018-01-24 19:55:57 UTC <brainmist> 12/ Whenever the bad thing they voted for occurs, it's "How could this possibly have happened?" They genuinely don't seem to understand. Point out the connection, and they divert immediately to more comfortable territory.
956253560513159168 2018-01-24 19:53:09 UTC <brainmist> 11/ And if they go to the funeral of someone who died in a preventable workplace accident, there's the inevitable wailing of "How did this happen?" When the friend is using GoFundMe to fight cancer, "How did this happen?" When the school shooting occurs, "How did this happen?"
956252683765198854 2018-01-24 19:49:40 UTC <brainmist> 10/ I have acquaintances who want labor laws struck down, laws requiring a minimum wage, safety regulations. It never occurs to them this might affect their kids, who will start somewhere, and probably somewhere low. THEIR kids are special. THEY will have better jobs.
956252120289894400 2018-01-24 19:47:26 UTC <brainmist> 9/ I have acquaintances who want the welfare state demolished, but touch their Medicaid, and all hell breaks out. Don't we understand, THEY need it to live? But of course, so do the rest of the recipients. It's just they don't see themselves as in that same demographic.
956251732035686400 2018-01-24 19:45:53 UTC <brainmist> 8/ Then he started grousing about how Dems are all corrupt. Faced with the contradictory position he espoused and protections he expects, he goes to morality.
956251309883252738 2018-01-24 19:44:13 UTC <brainmist> And his response was that he thought his legislators would just get rid of the regulations HE didn't like...even though those regulations exist to keep others safe from his actions. He wanted to be able to do harm, but can't see that these policies leave him reciprocally at risk.
956250963806912513 2018-01-24 19:42:50 UTC <brainmist> 6/ "How can people be allowed to do this? If we know it's harmful, why isn't there a law against it?" He was just stunned that there wasn't. I finally asked what he expected, when he and others have voted anti-regulation for decades. How is this outcome even remotely surprising?
956250331733725190 2018-01-24 19:40:20 UTC <brainmist> 5/ And I see it displayed in the relative who religiously (aha) votes GOP because he hates regulations, then laments in absolute disbelief that he's been injured by an environmental hazard that should be regulated but isn't.
956249969878593536 2018-01-24 19:38:53 UTC <brainmist> 4/ They gleefully jump onto the wagon to do unto others some pretty awful things, because it never occurs to them that they might also be in that category. That category is OTHER.  Not them. They'll be fine. Their candidate owes them and only them. Track record notwithstanding.
956249612716859393 2018-01-24 19:37:28 UTC <brainmist> 3/ It's this bizarre disconnect that has people rooting for their candidates to destroy "Obamacare" with no clue that Obamacare is the ACA insurance keeping them alive.  Their candidate wouldn't touch THEIR insurance! Obamacare must be something else. Probably for black people.
956248943603716097 2018-01-24 19:34:49 UTC <brainmist> 2/ So they vote for people whose declared intents and past record indicate that GOP politician will do things blatantly against the voter's interests, with this bizarre assumption that THEIR rep would of COURSE never do anything that could harm them.
956248475137642498 2018-01-24 19:32:57 UTC <brainmist> My experience has been that many conservatives think their elected representatives will magically channel and enact only their personal whims, not the campaign promises or party or corporate sponsors.

956242237955993601 2018-01-24 19:08:10 UTC <brainmist> @joniernst @ChuckGrassley @ransomnoble They're still denying.  You read Joni staunchly insisting she'll follow through on her promise to destroy the ACA, even though the overwhelming consensus is "No, Joni, don't kill Iowans!" and it's apparent she's talking herself into it, not anyone else.
956203671020359680 2018-01-24 16:34:55 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat It is. I get it.  Most often from phone surveys. Yeah, it's weird.
956202967190863872 2018-01-24 16:32:07 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Sad thing is, the same GOP that went full bore after Clinton for lying about an affair with an intern will somehow ignore Trump lying about colluding with Russians.

955632337575956480 2018-01-22 02:44:38 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Pitbull. He's a Staffordshire terrier, actually, but most people just class them all as pits. He adopted me. And he's very, very needy. Of squishiness.
955630386977169408 2018-01-22 02:36:53 UTC <brainmist> @CNN @BettyWi11396930 @resistrussia I made it myself! And it's completely necessary.
955527249834528768 2018-01-22 19:47:03 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Hey, it's not soft!    *poke poke*  OK, it's gotten a little soft.  Spoiled pibble is deliberately fattening me up, because he likes a comfy pillow.
955526884539944960 2018-01-22 19:45:36 UTC <brainmist> One of the hardest things to do.https://twitter.com/THR/status/955488244942204928
955526655635787783 2018-01-22 19:44:42 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat You wish.
955520233585946624 2018-01-22 19:19:11 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Where is "E. All of the Above"?
955519599482634240 2018-01-22 19:16:39 UTC <brainmist> @KimReynoldsIA @4Dfruitbat But the further west you go, the more likely you'll find yourself dealing with some truly rancid shit.  And yet, for some reason, media wonks seem to decide to get their representative sample there.
955519085453938689 2018-01-22 19:14:37 UTC <brainmist> @KimReynoldsIA @4Dfruitbat Hey now, sties are useful things. Styes? Anyway, I too like Iowa. But I find it best to think of it as an east-facing pig. On the east side, you've got an inquisitive, intelligent, personable creature that's ugly-cute and loves to try new things.
955517721940291585 2018-01-22 19:09:12 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat It's like the "snowflake" thing, especially from someone living in a warm clime. Yeah, snowflakes are delicate, but babycakes, you KNOW if you see five of us together, you're panicking, canceling everything, and stocking up on bread.
955517537361563654 2018-01-22 19:08:28 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat What kills me is how delicate the peeps are who mock others' perspectives. Why do they think that mockery can only possibly go one way?
955516433756311553 2018-01-22 19:04:05 UTC <brainmist> @KimReynoldsIA @4Dfruitbat She said and did a lot of things as lieutenant governor that made it seem unlikely.  For example, she was a lot more friendly with the Bob Vander Plaats types than Branstad.  And that crowd is pretty much the fetid anus of the pig that is Iowa.
955515090161274880 2018-01-22 18:58:44 UTC <brainmist> @z3ro_K @4Dfruitbat @CynicalEyebrow That's what we kept telling the Orbitz!  You know what's unsettling?  When your indestructable and unpotable beverage snickers in contempt.
955503631498989568 2018-01-22 18:13:12 UTC <brainmist> @CynicalEyebrow SJRs, OTOH, are totally OK with chopping up squatters for firewood.  *looks at every white person in the Americas*
955503325960720386 2018-01-22 18:11:59 UTC <brainmist> @CynicalEyebrow OMG THAT WAS ME!  *waves*
955498007780261889 2018-01-22 17:50:52 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Nah, that's just your ego getting hopeful. *winky*  It's not always about you, white boy!
955497472750768131 2018-01-22 17:48:44 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Of course, my efforts for independence are often thwarted by how often I get enlisted by an otherwise undirected group of SJs. Then I get to be the Scruffy Vagabond Leader with the Heart of Gold, the Morals of Flexibility, and the Tongue of Leaving Your Self-Esteem Bleeding Out.
955496804644212738 2018-01-22 17:46:05 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat No, but see, that's the beauty of the SJ rogue class! I'm a free agent, an SJ mercenary who might just pick a white supremacist's pocket while skewering his sense of self-importance with my epic backstab & my +3 Dagger of Insight Into All The Ways You're Really a Puling Manbaby.
955494857270800386 2018-01-22 17:38:20 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat LOL!  I suspect you just harbor an unconscious negative impression of the term from years of being around people who think social justice is somehow THE WORST THING.
955493949438877697 2018-01-22 17:34:44 UTC <brainmist> @CynicalEyebrow The best part of this was when Twitter announced it could translate from Haitian Creole....
955493775442407425 2018-01-22 17:34:02 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Of course, the joke's on them, because ACTUALLY, I'm a social justice rogue with a side of ranger.
955493487931256837 2018-01-22 17:32:54 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat I'm more often correctly ID'd as SJW, because I argue far more with far right assholes, and they think that's an insult.)
955493212852023296 2018-01-22 17:31:48 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat You and me both. What I love is when I am also declared to be an alt-right male anti-abortion Creationist because, no, see, none of those things, I just think the person I'm arguing with is an idiot.
955491521645727745 2018-01-22 17:25:05 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat My experience is that, if people think you're this diverse a range of things, you're probably really just an argumentative asshole who dislikes nodding along while others rant.
955491102311804931 2018-01-22 17:23:25 UTC <brainmist> Not remotely shocked.https://twitter.com/brownandbella/status/955141174171459585
955490629471166465 2018-01-22 17:21:32 UTC <brainmist> Probably when he does this, he thinks he's speaking Indian.  (Yes, I know, that would be Hindi or Bengali.  But does Trump know that?  Of course he doesn't.)https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/955479706920542208
955490093577523200 2018-01-22 17:19:25 UTC <brainmist> @CynicalEyebrow This is why we're friends.  (In this case, "friends" means I lurk in astral form.  Yeah, I'm there now.  Look up in the corner, near the window.)
955489578944778240 2018-01-22 17:17:22 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Isn't "customers" synonymous with "horde"?  I mean, unless business is super crappy.  In which case "customers" is mostly "support group".  It's not the individual though (well, SOMETIMES it is). It's about the never-ending, repetitive deluge.
955475405284237313 2018-01-22 16:21:03 UTC <brainmist> @CynicalEyebrow @z3ro_K @4Dfruitbat We didn't know what abomination we would create.  WE DIDN'T KNOW
955475031781462017 2018-01-22 16:19:34 UTC <brainmist> @CynicalEyebrow @z3ro_K (Funny aside: remember Orbitz drinks, a horrible syrupy fluid with suspended gelatin? A chemist friend of mine and I once went through household chemicals trying to dissolve those.  They're still alive. Somewhere.) @4Dfruitbat
955472822821949441 2018-01-22 16:10:47 UTC <brainmist> @CynicalEyebrow @z3ro_K I think we can't leap to any conclusions on it yet. Best bet is to isolate a very small sample and start trying methods.  I'm thinking maybe strong acid.

955461392479477760 2018-01-22 15:25:22 UTC <brainmist> Plus the underlying whinge of white supremacists seems to be "Life is hard/might be harder if we don't have an automatic advantage bestowed at birth".

954873557644955648 2018-01-20 00:29:31 UTC <brainmist> @DonCheadle Oh look, overwhelming Trump support!  Ok, it's not. But like the resistance managed to muster anything.....pic.twitter.com/CwvtwDD4hD

954831811082883072 2018-01-20 21:43:38 UTC <brainmist> Every time some pseudo Christian decides to trot out the threat of Jesus coming back and schooling all us heathens, I think, "Boy, you'd better pray not, because I will be braiding the whipcord for him to thrash your hypocritical ass!"
954814152912056320 2018-01-20 20:33:28 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @MrTommyCampbell No, we didn't. Sexual assault is wrong even when it's against a shithole like Trump.  But we're sure as hell going to grab him by the ballot box.
954813797721628672 2018-01-20 20:32:03 UTC <brainmist> I went to a Women's March and the weather is beautiful, but this may still be there highlight of my day....https://twitter.com/LibyaLiberty/status/954786041939963904
954768849320194048 2018-01-20 17:33:27 UTC <brainmist> @AngieElliott30 Now I kinda wish I'd planned to bring him, because he is well behaved, and I thought of the perfect sign for him: "I'm trained to not immediately touch your genitals. Don't you wish you could say the same for your president?"
954762606279045121 2018-01-20 17:08:38 UTC <brainmist> @AngieElliott30 Ugh. Sounds like it will be a good turnout though.
954762381086855169 2018-01-20 17:07:44 UTC <brainmist> @AngieElliott30 I'm sure he'd be fine, but it adds to the juggling I have to do.  Of course, right now he's doing his best "I'm really just a widdle baby" snuggling, so I have one hand and a foot free...
954760158089023489 2018-01-20 16:58:54 UTC <brainmist> @AngieElliott30 He's going to be really put out when I shift him off so I can go to the Women's March. But mostly because he's like to march with me.
954752779066757121 2018-01-20 16:29:35 UTC <brainmist> @ChuckGrassley I used to think you were an honest person and a statesman. Appalling to see how far you've fallen down your #GOPshithole
954752338945822723 2018-01-20 16:27:50 UTC <brainmist> @AngieElliott30 He is now manspreading for all he's worth, which means I'm pinned down and can't move. I just wanted to drink my coffee in peace.   Of course, when Schmoopie does it, it's cute. Probably because I can have his balls removed if he gets aggressive.
954749456632766466 2018-01-20 16:16:23 UTC <brainmist> *"minding my beeswax" takes on new layering, because we now exist in a world populated with such toxic, destructive people that some will literally attack apiaries because take that, bees! I guess?  Mind your beeswax. There are people out there who would destroy it.
954747884859256832 2018-01-20 16:10:08 UTC <brainmist> So I'm just sitting minding my own beeswax* and my dog flung himself into my lap, wedging his balls firmly under my leg.  Then he looked at me reproachfully as if, by merely existing, I was deliberately crushing his balls. And I deja-vued so hard to every MRA interaction ever.

954035066505760769 2018-01-18 16:57:39 UTC <brainmist> @studentactivism @cynnicysm @HonestTaalib I mean, you could have just not openly identified yourself as clueless, while somehow deciding your ineptitude was someone else's fault and explaining how they needed to change to suit you.  You could have gone that route.
954034711365644288 2018-01-18 16:56:14 UTC <brainmist> @studentactivism @cynnicysm @HonestTaalib Oh, sweetie.  Fun fact: it's not the OP's obligation to dumb down his content to your satisfaction. YOU opted to engage with it. It was not forced upon you in any way. But YOU kept the OP tagged, which does present your fumbling efforts to him directly.  And he shouldn't respond?

953403500377059328 2018-01-16 23:08:02 UTC <brainmist> @GradyPounders Well, thank you for participating as an example of exactly the sort of selective comprehension described initially. While it's hardly surprising, it is always illuminating to new observers when a subject demonstrates the discussed behavior.  *jots notes in imaginary notebook*
953402151920984064 2018-01-16 23:02:41 UTC <brainmist> @GradyPounders But of course it's still on women to somehow communicate to men, while men* cover their metaphorical ears and chant "LALALALAA!" for all they're worth, because it's not like communication is a two-way street or like men bear any responsibility. *(some men, but specifically Grady)
953401526755774474 2018-01-16 23:00:11 UTC <brainmist> @GradyPounders So THAT's a "No".  But let's recap: Women should use their words, because non-verbal is HARD*. But not words that call men out. Or too many words. Or, really, any words, because verbal is HARD*.  *(when men don't like the content being communicated)
953365034830352386 2018-01-16 20:35:11 UTC <brainmist> Meanwhile women continue to know that hooking up with a man is dangerous, and may end with their murder.

950095764461629440 2018-01-07 20:04:16 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Perhaps more central east? Of course, that's assuming Trump even knows where Korea is. Puerto Rico should probably be nervous.

949674880890482690 2018-01-06 16:11:50 UTC <brainmist> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP: Whatever Trump has on you, it's not worth it. For starters, he's going to out you eventually. Maybe in a spiteful tweet, maybe just bragging to his audience, doesn't matter. He can't keep a secret.  Stop propping up this nightmare. Do your damn jobs.

946883030454558720 2017-12-29 23:18:01 UTC <brainmist> Systematic disenfranchisement of voters, particularly minorities, helped Trump win in 2016. It's no coincidence; the push for these laws was funded by those who benefit the most from Trump's handouts.  It's time to return the ballot to the people. #TakeAmericaBack #FlipTheHousehttps://twitter.com/samswey/status/939195219052040194

946859377427873792 2017-12-29 21:44:02 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat More than half of American voters didn't vote for Trump, and, if we hadn't had increasing voter disenfranchisement, that percentage would be higher. But yeah, the idiots in this nation are fucking us up. Um.  Does Scotland have a good refugee resettlement program?

He wagged his tail warily, I wagged my hand back, he trotted through my gate and up to the house like he'd always lived there. And now he does.

I can, believe it or not, remember Republicans with dignity, integrity, and concern for their constituents, not just their funders.

Equality isn't achieved for women when the unqualified child of an oligarch is handed a job she didn't earn, doesn't understand, and cannot do. It's achieved when qualified women who have worked for and earned the job aren't denied it because they're women.

931611264249409537 2017-11-17 19:53:28 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat But don't worry, you won't have to deal with that. They won't come to you, because they know you think some women want the assault.
931611067259801600 2017-11-17 19:52:41 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat Which means someday, they'll blame themselves for letting some guy "get away with" the assault they didn't ask for and didn't want.
931610684722380801 2017-11-17 19:51:10 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat The tragedy is, whether you say it directly to them or not, your daughters will pick up on and internalize your opinions.
931604636892581888 2017-11-17 19:27:08 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat LOL.  It's possible that educating you on your internalized acceptance of rape culture isn't my only job, dude.
931604486682021889 2017-11-17 19:26:32 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat No, I think you wouldn't, because you love them. Yet when it's someone else, you're a lot more flexible.  I'm pointing out the hypocrisy of your position.
931595824890564609 2017-11-17 18:52:07 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat They're far and away the minority. Yet the mere possibility leads to mass victim shaming/ blaming. This affects your daughters too.
931595397209952261 2017-11-17 18:50:25 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat Because these women you're dismissing, they're someone's daughters too.
931595200551702528 2017-11-17 18:49:38 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat Dude, I didn't suggest they should be. But realistically? There's a good chance they will. Will you still think women want it from rich men?
931594792768811009 2017-11-17 18:48:01 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat If you can't use your words to convey your thoughts accurately, MAYBE STOP USING THEM TO CONVEY YOUR THOUGHTS.
931594197034991616 2017-11-17 18:45:39 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat And when women try to fight that, we're punished, usually more severely than our assailants.
931594026238861319 2017-11-17 18:44:58 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat And the more power the man has, the more immune he is to consequences. Women don't let rich men get away, but society does.
931593828158537728 2017-11-17 18:44:11 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat We look at a reality where reporting our assault results in being called liars, sluts, golddiggers, losing our job and professional rep.
931593534070755329 2017-11-17 18:43:01 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat It's not that women look at the money and think "oh, tralala, rich guy, that unsolicited groping was fun then!"
931593363316453376 2017-11-17 18:42:20 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat When you say"women let rich dudes get away" with sexual assault, you're presenting the situation as if the guy's money made the assault ok.
931593104603435008 2017-11-17 18:41:18 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat Maybe you should think how you phrase things, then, since that is the information about you that you provide.
931592062167855104 2017-11-17 18:37:10 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat Just out of curiosity, if/ when one of your daughters is assaulted, will you ask about her assailant's finances before getting angry?
931591844978479105 2017-11-17 18:36:18 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat That you have two daughters, yet still think sexual assault is ok from rich men because the women wanted it. This is what you've told us.
931583173326266369 2017-11-17 18:01:51 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat If you've accepted that rich men are allowed to get away with sexual assault because money, YOU'VE told us you're ok with sexual assault.
931582851010781185 2017-11-17 18:00:34 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat Right. Remind me... How many daughters does Trump have? Clinton? Franken?
931577499519242240 2017-11-17 17:39:18 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat That some people might be attracted does not give those with power free license to do what they want. Assault is assault.
931577210246397952 2017-11-17 17:38:09 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat You're conflating attraction and coercion, dismissing the possibility of assault by a man w power because some women find power attractive.
931575673608654849 2017-11-17 17:32:03 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat Look at what you are saying. You are clearly saying "take advantage".  Did some boys let priests w candy "take advantage"? It's STILL WRONG.
931573682278944769 2017-11-17 17:24:08 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat Your phrasing makes it clear that on some level you're thinking that you too could "get away with" sexual assault, if only you were rich.
931573289440497664 2017-11-17 17:22:34 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat You are essentially blaming them and denying their assault. YOU are part of #WhyWomenDontReport
931572816784363520 2017-11-17 17:20:41 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat When you say "what women let rich men get away with", you're stating that women are complicit in assaults. They wanted it, because money.

931567617244041218 2017-11-17 17:00:02 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat If someone brags about assault, and multiple women confirm, it's definitely time to investigate the assaults, yes. How is that confusing?
931565340479369216 2017-11-17 16:50:59 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @AdamBlackhat Neither should get a pass. Investigate/litigate Franken. But first take down the guy who openly bragged he could assault women w impunity.

867421380907806720 2017-05-24 16:45:47 UTC <brainmist> @IMPL0RABLE @Groundoggy But he's Muslim, so this is just random Muslim violence! Completely unjustified! Against a neo Nazi terrorist cell planning a bomb attack!

800038143382716417 2016-11-19 18:08:52 UTC <brainmist> @Hollyfeeney13 @HillaryNo1sPres Yes! There is absolutely not going to be a greater demand than supply! Return your tickets! #boycottHamilton
800037692562083840 2016-11-19 18:07:04 UTC <brainmist> It's not even satire, folks.https://twitter.com/HillaryNo1sPres/status/800034703550119936
800037012791238657 2016-11-19 18:04:22 UTC <brainmist> It's nice that, in the midst of 2016, some things can still make me laugh....https://twitter.com/HillaryNo1sPres/status/800030548093784067
800030035579174912 2016-11-19 17:36:38 UTC <brainmist> @HillaryNo1sPres Oh, are you not going?  I will take your ticket!
800029917140369409 2016-11-19 17:36:10 UTC <brainmist> Let's just admire the level of oblivious hypocrisy it takes to regularly encourage violence at rallies, but feel this was an attack.
800029385550102528 2016-11-19 17:34:03 UTC <brainmist> Because being politely addressed about legitimate concerns is absolutely the WORST thing that's ever happened in a theatre. #BoycottHamilton
799623980781019138 2016-11-18 14:43:07 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat That's my thought.
799537975935832064 2016-11-18 09:01:22 UTC <brainmist> @brainmist I don't think it was human.  But I think it was significant.  I'll be waiting for a further indication. Ax to hand.
799537389270167552 2016-11-18 08:59:02 UTC <brainmist> @brainmist I have an idea how it got in, but not how it got out. I don't think it's here. But I've thought that before, too.
799537085581500416 2016-11-18 08:57:50 UTC <brainmist> @brainmist Big enough to break dishes and open the pantry; small enough to eat the carbs it found.  This isn't the first time.
799536813551521792 2016-11-18 08:56:45 UTC <brainmist> At what point does my tweeted life become a horror story? Tonight, I came home to discover something else had been here first.
799472621725196288 2016-11-17 04:41:41 UTC <brainmist> @SarcasticRover A week after this election, you're lucky we're not tweeting nonstop incoherent screams back.
799178219438145536 2016-11-17 09:11:50 UTC <brainmist> Proposal for next four years: Everyone tag #Trump in incendiary tweets: we'll keep him too distracted w/ Twitter wars to start any real ones
799015246224642051 2016-11-16 22:24:14 UTC <brainmist> I'm beginning to think the first mistake was opposable thumbs.https://twitter.com/4Dfruitbat/status/799010951001477124
799012829034594304 2016-11-16 22:14:38 UTC <brainmist> @horror_made @Josh_Finney And how is this inconsistent with a haiku suggesting we would do well to look at history? Or are you agreeing?
799007487869538305 2016-11-16 21:53:24 UTC <brainmist> @horror_made @brainmist @Josh_Finney What is your point relative to my haiku?
799007079860203520 2016-11-16 21:51:47 UTC <brainmist> @horror_made @Josh_Finney Although I'll point out my haiku did not specify the US as the only nation that needed to review history.
799006390421508103 2016-11-16 21:49:02 UTC <brainmist> @horror_made @Josh_Finney Yes, but as a non voting non citizen of the EU, my primary concern to address is my nation's swing.
799006103929573382 2016-11-16 21:47:54 UTC <brainmist> @horror_made @Josh_Finney So what is your point?
799005905895432192 2016-11-16 21:47:07 UTC <brainmist> @JillPantozzi Chuck Tingle is a pervasive influence. A delightful pervasive influence.
799005261147099144 2016-11-16 21:44:33 UTC <brainmist> @horror_made @Josh_Finney Note my haiku is not: "Sure, things seem bad now But look: Hitler's Germany Turned out just peachy!"
799004723911282688 2016-11-16 21:42:25 UTC <brainmist> @horror_made @Josh_Finney It's possible to be concerned about multiple dire situations at once. Feel free to retweet my haiku to Merkel.
798981953080950784 2016-11-16 20:11:56 UTC <brainmist> @horror_made @Josh_Finney Really? Are you really confused?  Because you probably wouldn't have made your initial comment if you were.
798966650846351361 2016-11-16 19:11:08 UTC <brainmist> I would pay money to see a Tingle/Trump Twitter war. Winner takes the presidency. What have we got to lose?https://twitter.com/ChuckTingle/status/798943475999723520
798943132792586242 2016-11-16 17:37:41 UTC <brainmist> @horror_made @Josh_Finney We should probably be taking a lesson from them now, then, shouldn't we.
798748952359075840 2016-11-15 04:46:04 UTC <brainmist> Think it can't get worse? Look at Weimar Germany. History repeats.  #horrorhaikuesday #darkesttimeline #fuck2016

798418173313814530 2016-11-14 06:51:41 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @HillaryClinton @joyouswarrior @WarAgainstWomen Again, this is you arguing against a perceived position, not preparedness.
798417951196069888 2016-11-14 06:50:48 UTC <brainmist> @joyouswarrior @shlepcar "The Sheep &the Goats" outlines Jesus' roadmap to Heaven. Trump's speeches & actions? Squarely in the "Hell" column
798417057155051520 2016-11-14 06:47:14 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @HillaryClinton @joyouswarrior @WarAgainstWomen Again, how is this pertinent to whether she's prepared to take office?
798416810928443392 2016-11-14 06:46:16 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @HillaryClinton @joyouswarrior @WarAgainstWomen But do you really think she'd do worse for environ. that Trump's anti-science pick?
798416529960402945 2016-11-14 06:45:09 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @HillaryClinton @joyouswarrior @WarAgainstWomen Her position on an issue does not equate to a lack of preparation.
798410777359224832 2016-11-14 06:22:17 UTC <brainmist> You know what's sad? @HillaryClinton is more ready TODAY to fill the @POTUS than Trump will be on Jan 19.  #StillWithHer

797693439689326592 2016-11-12 06:51:51 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty We've had decades of seeing what kind of man he is: the more power he has, the more he abuses others. But no, it's a mystery.

797079828994342913 2016-11-11 14:13:34 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat I've side tracked into wondering if potato ketchup is just mashed potatoes, or something you squeeze on steak.
797077677471580162 2016-11-11 14:05:01 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat @venturextweets Differences matter a great deal, especially if I throw produce. Hm. I wonder if ketchup from potatoes is good?
797077390551896064 2016-11-11 14:03:53 UTC <brainmist> He's demonized refugees, mocked the disabled, bilked the poor as employees. He's called for harm to others. All this he and his do to Jesus.
797076184878161920 2016-11-11 13:59:06 UTC <brainmist> Since Trump supporters have claimed he represents the side of Christians. How does Trump react to others' need? By persecuting the needy.https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/797053769099792385
797075421871439872 2016-11-11 13:56:04 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat @venturextweets This isn't about hating Trump. It's about refusing what he represents.

797069741517049857 2016-11-11 13:33:29 UTC <brainmist> @ransomnoble @MargaretAtwood Even the Civil Rights movement, a push forward, predates my generation. We were still moving forward. And now?
797068566436646913 2016-11-11 13:28:49 UTC <brainmist> @ransomnoble @MargaretAtwood WWII. I didn't experience Korea; Vietnam for a child had little impact. The Cold War was just fear in the end.
796995407280828416 2016-11-11 08:38:07 UTC <brainmist> @Dan_Van_Winkle I'm sticking to "Cheeto coated shit pile". But I've stopped with the S Doolbaz dicture.  I realized it's unfair to penises.

796823048838070273 2016-11-10 21:13:13 UTC <brainmist> It's entertaining when trolls give up because you won't change your topic to suit them. I'm going to try this with RL random encounters.
796814714286342144 2016-11-10 20:40:06 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david Then, if she talks about her experiences to you (can't blame her if she doesn't), roll your eyes &say "Are you still on this?"

796813783826104320 2016-11-10 20:36:24 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david I know! Wow, it's been a few whole tweets and we're on the same topic I started on!! How will you live??
796804154115112961 2016-11-10 19:58:08 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david But your deliberate ignorance does nothing to make your mother, sisters, friends safer. It just lets you feel like they are.
796803938695675905 2016-11-10 19:57:17 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david So you're too much of a coward to find out for yourself? No surprise.
796801798292045825 2016-11-10 19:48:47 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david And try not to be an absolute ass about it. It's really hard to tell your family/friends about sexual assault. Don't screw up.
796801183432245248 2016-11-10 19:46:20 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david Baby cakes, you live in the world, and you know women. Stop trolling, and go talk to them. Talk to your mother, your friends.
796777497715212288 2016-11-10 18:12:13 UTC <brainmist> ... Muslims, disabled people, refugees...  Is it wrong for me to want to send Trump a mirror and a card that says "Candyman" x5?https://twitter.com/TonyTodd54/status/796775296343150593
796738377320202240 2016-11-10 15:36:46 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david And protection of their assailants means daughters who dare report will be dismissed, harassed, fired, intimidated, attacked.
796736144104968192 2016-11-10 15:27:54 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david Dads who voted for Trump voted for a world where assault on their daughters is outweighed by the value of the assailant.
796735587478892545 2016-11-10 15:25:41 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david Trump's election makes it clear that deliberately assaulting women will have no impact on the assailant's life.
796734946438246400 2016-11-10 15:23:08 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david Boys and men grab us because it's so common, they don't think it's wrong. Or they do, but know there will be no repercussions.
796734683170111488 2016-11-10 15:22:05 UTC <brainmist> @dave67_david They never have been able. Ask any woman you know when she was first groped: most of us were still children.
796733124004737024 2016-11-10 15:15:54 UTC <brainmist> I wish I could convey to fathers who voted Trump: YOU are the reason you will never be able to keep your little girl safe like you promised.
796720573980229632 2016-11-10 14:26:01 UTC <brainmist> 2016: the year of victims being shown that your rape didn't matter, but your rapist does. #fuck2016

796596411047510016 2016-11-09 06:12:39 UTC <brainmist> @TheGoodGodAbove The nation.  All of us were capable of working to make an informed choice.  Trump himself presented the vital info.

796451574499463168 2016-11-09 20:37:07 UTC <brainmist> @cathschaffstump Internalized bigotry so severe people believe absurd, debunked rumors, but dismiss a man directly bragging about assault.

796306820730068992 2016-11-09 11:01:55 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy Of course he would, had he got the nom, because Clinton supporters would have supported him, like they did Obama. Like adults do.
796306602047524864 2016-11-09 11:01:03 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy Especially sickening for me is the Bernie supporters crowing about how THEIR candidate could have won.

796300381114564608 2016-11-09 10:36:20 UTC <brainmist> 2008: I quip that @Iowa 's support for Obama didn't mean we were less racist, just more sexist.  2016: Iowa proves that to be true.
796299228645621760 2016-11-09 10:31:45 UTC <brainmist> Oh look, a new level of insomnia.  Just what I was hoping for.
796296661798506498 2016-11-09 10:21:33 UTC <brainmist> @AlanTudyk Hope?  I think it's probably hope.
796296085157322752 2016-11-09 10:19:15 UTC <brainmist> But too many of Sanders' camp decided to hold out for EXACTLY what they wanted. Now they have Trump. We all have Trump. Good work.
796295616393527297 2016-11-09 10:17:24 UTC <brainmist> Berniebros touting how he'd have won. Of course he would; if nominated, Clinton supporters would have voted for him, like they did for Obama

796251188979232768 2016-11-08 07:20:51 UTC <brainmist> @yamainu @jeffvandermeer Conservative/ anti-government independents saw her orchestrating a bureaucratic conspiracy in league with enemies.
796250669367914496 2016-11-08 07:18:47 UTC <brainmist> @yamainu @jeffvandermeer Liberal independents believed she was in it for money/ power, despite her liberal positions.
796250421140615168 2016-11-08 07:17:48 UTC <brainmist> @yamainu @jeffvandermeer Sanders supporters who overlapped heavily couldn't put aside their disgruntlement; she must have cheated him!
796250192064323585 2016-11-08 07:16:54 UTC <brainmist> @yamainu @jeffvandermeer She took a small %. What cost Clinton was that too many people believe a woman with ambition was somehow unnatural.
796249494245560320 2016-11-08 07:14:07 UTC <brainmist> We knew, by the way we were told we were responsible for assaults on us. But way to show rapists that they can still achieve anything.https://twitter.com/macwrites/status/796213593486360576

796247834592997377 2016-11-08 07:07:31 UTC <brainmist> @NaheedMustafa @Hadas_Gold Why? He didn't stop being these things. He just demonstrated that these things are America.
796247517302296576 2016-11-08 07:06:16 UTC <brainmist> @tweetsthecreeps The premise of Watchmen, that, faced with a greater hazard, humans would forget their petty squabbles and unite?   False.
796245696190025728 2016-11-08 06:59:02 UTC <brainmist> If ever there was a time for electors to exert their power to cast a responsible vote, this was it.  I'm not optimistic.

786714226735714305 2016-10-13 23:44:22 UTC <brainmist> Because there will always be those who question motives/ integrity and shame the victim because they prefer the rapist. #WhyWomenDontReport https://twitter.com/FacMagnaAmerica/status/786707656153165824
786713919192764416 2016-10-13 23:43:09 UTC <brainmist> Because a hashtag to try to improve understanding of #WhyWomenDontReport gets hijacked and used to shame women who reported.

786639193665515520 2016-10-13 18:46:13 UTC <brainmist> When women decry Trump as the epitome of white male privilege & men respond by threatening our rights, they prove our point. #Repealthe19th

785938220529758208 2016-10-11 20:20:48 UTC <brainmist> @RawStory @femalep Mostly observational. But firsthand or otherwise, I think male failure to recognize women as people is worsening.
785935036214235136 2016-10-11 20:08:09 UTC <brainmist> @MelBrooks @coslive I'd call this a parallel to Obama's @POTUS experience, but this town eventually moved past their bias to recognize merit
785916115440414722 2016-10-11 18:52:58 UTC <brainmist> @RawStory @femalep I hope so. But my experiences have not left me optimistic.
785903406070181894 2016-10-11 18:02:28 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @LibyaLiberty But at least he didn't sexually assault women for funsies because hey, he's rich, he can get away with it.
785903120438046720 2016-10-11 18:01:19 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty @realDonaldTrump Hey now. That's an unfair comparison. True, Tasmanian Devil was a monster, devouring/destroying everything.
785901883130916864 2016-10-11 17:56:24 UTC <brainmist> @RawStory @femalep No. He won't. He may COMMIT sexual assault.  But he lives in a world where he won't be arrested for it.
785900651008045056 2016-10-11 17:51:31 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty They've already reimagined these crimes as acceptable, necessary assertions of dominance. The more I learn, the sicker I feel.

783783515125014528 2016-10-05 21:38:46 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty As a haunter in an area just hit with clown hysteria, I can kinda see the point. "Clown hunts" are now a thing.

783719366462353409 2016-10-05 17:23:52 UTC <brainmist> I'm just glad the @RockIslandPD knows which is a threat, and which isn't. Thanks for stepping in to prevent harm. #AngryMob2016 #HauntLife

783671819811205120 2016-10-05 14:14:56 UTC <brainmist> @AndyRichter Wouldn't it be great if the media cautioned the public on rapist sightings with the earnestness of clown sighting reports?
783472967002972160 2016-10-04 01:04:46 UTC <brainmist> @tweetsthecreeps *headdesk* I especially love the people complaining it's a month till Halloween. Fine then, no Christmas until December 24.
783425999853662208 2016-10-04 21:58:08 UTC <brainmist> @tweetsthecreeps Very true. Sad thing is, we've had spooks about in all seasons for years. But get a rumor going, and now we're menaces.
783419321577984000 2016-10-04 21:31:36 UTC <brainmist> @tweetsthecreeps Yeah it is. They could do a story and give it a positive/promo spin... But hysteria sells. Fortunately the cops know us.
783417051473809408 2016-10-04 21:22:34 UTC <brainmist> @tweetsthecreeps Anything for clicks and shares, I guess. There were plenty of threats towards him in the comments, but hey, she made news!
783416794174205952 2016-10-04 21:21:33 UTC <brainmist> @tweetsthecreeps She ignored multiple people pointing out the haunt, and that they knew him, because police hasn't gotten back to her.
783416654084517888 2016-10-04 21:21:00 UTC <brainmist> @tweetsthecreeps We had a reporter warning people to call police over a haunter a block from his haunt, on his way to a regular haunt bar.

780724633733476352 2016-09-27 11:03:52 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump spent that entire #debatenight wondering why the woman and black man kept interrupting him and hogging the discussion.
780722675761020928 2016-09-27 10:56:05 UTC <brainmist> @nytvideo @4Dfruitbat Well, yes. That @realDonaldTrump is frontrunner is indicative of how widespread that foolishness is.

780602451950837760 2016-09-26 02:58:22 UTC <brainmist> AHAHAHA!!  OMG what #debate was @mike_pence watching? His point was basically "Clinton was mean wah! but Trump played it cool!"
780601317429350401 2016-09-26 02:53:51 UTC <brainmist> The @GoDaddy #debates ad was just clearer, more concise, more compelling, and less eye-gouging than @realDonaldTrump

780593313426448384 2016-09-26 02:22:03 UTC <brainmist> Right now @realDonaldTrump is convinced the woman and the black guy are disproportionately hogging discussion. #Debates2016

780591781071114245 2016-09-26 02:15:57 UTC <brainmist> Wow. Trump has credited Clinton with fighting ISIS while stating we should have stolen ME oil. Pillaging wouldn't make us worse....#debates

780590624743358464 2016-09-26 02:11:22 UTC <brainmist> And now #Trump has declared that hackers are 400 lbs, bedbound, and that's why they and ISIS, not the Russians he encouraged, hack us.
780589946641915905 2016-09-26 02:08:40 UTC <brainmist> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Notice Donald in the audience. It's possible Trump doesn't recall, like he doesn't his failed deals, debts, lies....
780589490909777921 2016-09-26 02:06:51 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump claims he finally produced @POTUS birth cert, ignoring that Obama released his birth video in 2011: https://youtu.be/2bqEn8AXzJ4

780584915809075200 2016-09-26 01:48:41 UTC <brainmist> When @realDonaldTrump keeps demanding we bring back "Law & Order", he's talking about the TV show, isn't he.

777576681796096000 2016-09-18 18:35:02 UTC <brainmist> @NerdGerhl I assumed laundry wasn't a thing: used clothes were converted back to energy, new clothes replicated.

766682337249681408 2016-08-19 17:04:48 UTC <brainmist> @foxjen123 @fiercecircus It's probably PMS.  Better give us chocolate and hide the math textbooks!
766681991878029312 2016-08-19 17:03:25 UTC <brainmist> @hottestsingles @jmshiveley This art/ satire has at the very least elicited some fascinating, deep conversation, +hilarious response from NY
766681752366485504 2016-08-19 17:02:28 UTC <brainmist> @hottestsingles @jmshiveley Satire sometimes uses exaggerated cruelty to highlight acceptance of casual mistreatment (i.e.A Modest Proposal)
766681102798893057 2016-08-19 16:59:53 UTC <brainmist> @hottestsingles @jmshiveley And to some degree, the body shaming mocks by mimicry Trump's own tendency to objectify and shame.
766680847340535808 2016-08-19 16:58:52 UTC <brainmist> @hottestsingles @jmshiveley Because I agree that body shaming is a bad tactic...but also think that the visual metaphor has some merit.
766680391755239424 2016-08-19 16:57:04 UTC <brainmist> @hottestsingles @jmshiveley Hm. How to convey "The Emperor has no clothes" in a manner which does not involve a potentially mockable nudity.
766678823236612097 2016-08-19 16:50:50 UTC <brainmist> Which is a nice change, because normally my lingering fondness for Old Ones ruins EVERYTHING.  Ia! Ia!  Cthulhu ftagn!
766678498022862848 2016-08-19 16:49:32 UTC <brainmist> I liked it. But if the new one is good in a different way, the lingering fondness of the old one won't ruin it.
766678103909281792 2016-08-19 16:47:58 UTC <brainmist> I'm pretty optimistic.  My expectations are mostly shaped by the cartoon.
766677893338501121 2016-08-19 16:47:08 UTC <brainmist> @fiercecircus @foxjen123 "I can't brain!  My vagina is leaking!"  (OK, to be fair, I have had this thought.  But I brained anyway, damnit!)
766677056490917889 2016-08-19 16:43:49 UTC <brainmist> I confess, I was hoping for Patrick Warburton.  But hopefully this is a successful reincarnation.
766676425621463040 2016-08-19 16:41:18 UTC <brainmist> @fiercecircus @foxjen123 Heh.  My feels are like a fire I start under this idiot exec, using my science diplomas as kindling.

766668924767186944 2016-08-19 16:11:30 UTC <brainmist> Absolutely true.https://twitter.com/RiverMusicExp/status/766667813499105280
766668494821728256 2016-08-19 16:09:47 UTC <brainmist> @fiercecircus @foxjen123 Right? One article claimed it was because women were alienated by the "science" part of "Sci Fi". *head desk*~
766667613657104384 2016-08-19 16:06:17 UTC <brainmist> @foxjen123 Damnit. Now I actually have to write a thing.
766667285280927745 2016-08-19 16:04:59 UTC <brainmist> @fiercecircus @foxjen123 Hey, why not? Sci Fi went with what looks like an STD reference, because apparently they never met their base.
766666523951845376 2016-08-19 16:01:57 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest @Pouyalilpou But I will write a horror haiku for you.  As long as you die on #horrorhaikuesday.
766666190156550144 2016-08-19 16:00:38 UTC <brainmist> @foxjen123 Even better.  Actually, I may go with "Psyphon". That psy- lead in was all the rage in the '80s.
766665043572240385 2016-08-19 15:56:04 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest @foxjen123 "Cyphon" is going to be the term for cryptotech-augmented humans in my next retro-futuristic dystopian YA fiction.
766661791170428929 2016-08-19 15:43:09 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat oh. OK, well then.  Go you?
766654778575245312 2016-08-19 15:15:17 UTC <brainmist> @JillPantozzi Feisty. Supportive. Independent.
766652436698103808 2016-08-19 15:05:59 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat or you could be happier on a Friday.
766652350673006592 2016-08-19 15:05:38 UTC <brainmist> @colleeeenmk Sorry, tone isn't evident. I meant to talk to you as a person w/ a potential appreciation of vaguely naughty linguistic humor.
766649543148523526 2016-08-19 14:54:29 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest @colleeeenmk But it was OK, because they also screwed up the time zone, PST for CST, so we had an unexpected two hours.
766648392910942210 2016-08-19 14:49:55 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest @colleeeenmk Dumb was the show that listed the wrong city... Something we discovered about 50 miles off course.
766647991943827456 2016-08-19 14:48:19 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest @colleeeenmk ('Gentle ribbing' is an old timey term for "jk", not some bizarre but innocuous sex act. At least, it used to be.)
766647659331407872 2016-08-19 14:47:00 UTC <brainmist> @colleeeenmk lol. You're not dumb. Life has variables, and you missed one. Then you tagged @RiotFest which invites gentle ribbing.
766646890330861568 2016-08-19 14:43:56 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Hey, you should passive aggressively tweet instead!
766646070176731136 2016-08-19 14:40:41 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest @colleeeenmk Lol. S'okay. The Midwest is used to the East Coast forgetting we might have our own things.
766508950611107840 2016-08-18 05:35:49 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty My left foot is to interstellar travel? Hallmark is to a poet laureate? Bill Cosby is to feminism?
766507755033153536 2016-08-18 05:31:04 UTC <brainmist> @GingerGibson I'm so glad I'm not the only person who had this thought. #TrumpIsToIntelligentAs a sturgeon is to Tour de France winner.
766507408784928768 2016-08-18 05:29:41 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty It's not a grammar error, they're just missing the second half. "Trump is to intelligent as...." A camel is to aerodynamic?
766385322104020992 2016-08-18 21:24:34 UTC <brainmist> @NaheedMustafa @Raquel_Savage This is why I've stopped viewing global warming as a bad thing.

766308000172609536 2016-08-18 16:17:19 UTC <brainmist> @matthewteller it corrected my typed "spolohird" to "apologies".
766306782788526080 2016-08-18 16:12:28 UTC <brainmist> @Twitter @matthewteller I had to retweet because it corrected the original. Now it's trying to correct again. Stop silencing me, @twitter !

766266743924809728 2016-08-18 13:33:22 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy maybe it's mocking the fact that she poops. Women aren't supposed to poop... It suggests they've eaten food at some point.
766260444549918721 2016-08-18 13:08:21 UTC <brainmist> @imraansiddiqi @LibyaLiberty @washingtonpost When America's climate of xenophobic bigotry meets its failure to provide post combat support.

766002632229990400 2016-08-17 20:03:53 UTC <brainmist> But I guess an aggressive Russia is just fine; it was those darn social support programs we opposed, not the threat of war.
766002348846002176 2016-08-17 20:02:46 UTC <brainmist> Let's savor the irony that this person is probably a Trump supporter, despite Trump being a Putin supporter.
765799082950529024 2016-08-16 06:35:03 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat @AtomicAzalea So you're not wrong, you're traditional. And possibly biblical. This uses both tenses: https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-5-33/
765797878212288513 2016-08-16 06:30:16 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat @AtomicAzalea I actually have seen "bare witness" as an old variant of "bore witness"... So past tense of "bear witness ".
765552161878966272 2016-08-16 14:13:53 UTC <brainmist> "Bear witness?" She rasped. "It's everywhere, all the time. Bear witness? To whom??"  #HorrorHaikuesday #WhenRealityIsDarkerThanHorror

765200632709906433 2016-08-15 14:57:02 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat We all do.  And yet we all do.  The only solution is to just shake it off, shake it off.
765194882503757826 2016-08-15 14:34:11 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump I just want karma to kick in his door, detain him w/out access to lawyers, give him a taste of the fear he loves in others.
765194495189057541 2016-08-15 14:32:38 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump That this... Human... Gleefully encourages torture of suspects while he skirts blatant treason w impunity is galling.
765194013880180736 2016-08-15 14:30:44 UTC <brainmist> I don't actually want @realDonaldTrump waterboarded. I don't want ANYONE waterboarded. But if eventually he fears he will be...That'd be OK.
765193167880593408 2016-08-15 14:27:22 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Eh. You pick your pot to stew in. Myself, I tend to just stop following the wanters and haters.  And then I play Taylor Swift.

765190424130572292 2016-08-15 14:16:28 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat That's not the internet. Boomers had that long before the internet.

763109434310615040 2016-08-09 20:27:21 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest You need to post screencaps so we can mock them even after they've deleted their accounts in shame.
763108915781341184 2016-08-09 20:25:18 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest It'd be nice if we could recognize an athlete's achievements at an event recognizing athletic achievement, even if she's a she.

763058921300856832 2016-08-09 17:06:38 UTC <brainmist> @Angelatopia I suspect it's because they feel a need to have their own life choices validated.
763058648310427649 2016-08-09 17:05:33 UTC <brainmist> @Angelatopia But it's amazing how many people have heard my inclination & immediately suggested I should do the exact opposite for funsiess
763058444274315264 2016-08-09 17:04:44 UTC <brainmist> @Angelatopia I knew by 5 yrs I didn't want to marry/have kids. Told my parents I was going to be a nun. Then found out women could bachelor.
763058100173574144 2016-08-09 17:03:22 UTC <brainmist> @Angelatopia It's a pretty major life change.  Absolutely one to go into if you want and circumstances allow! But not for everyone.

760132462512971778 2016-08-01 15:17:56 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Perhaps something invoking an ideal instead? If the individual falls from grace, the ideal still stands.
760132144068907009 2016-08-01 15:16:40 UTC <brainmist> The cognitive dissonance must be absolutely deafening... Assuming Trumpistas have the wit & perception to even detect it.
760131802061082624 2016-08-01 15:15:18 UTC <brainmist> After all, that's what they claim liberals are doing when liberals call to an end to pointless wars.

760089841128267776 2016-08-01 12:28:34 UTC <brainmist> @DrJillStein @GovGaryJohnson @Snowden it's more accurate to say they were that percent's first choice.
760088951050768388 2016-08-01 12:25:02 UTC <brainmist> @SpeakerRyan @LibyaLiberty @AtomicAzalea Eh. Ryan probably also agrees air is important, although I'm guessing he'd still kill the EPA.
760087917226176512 2016-08-01 12:20:55 UTC <brainmist> @CynicalEyebrow I'll give that a try, but I think it will raise eyebrows *aha* when I casually start licking my now delicious armpit.

759390202372567040 2016-07-30 14:08:27 UTC <brainmist> @renalovelis @HeyViolet Sorry to have missed much of your show. @iwirelessCenter gave start time as 7:30, then were slow getting people in.

759096717434204164 2016-07-29 18:42:15 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest Then go back for seconds and savor the tiny details you may have missed the first time.
759096512114597888 2016-07-29 18:41:26 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest Can we be both? I prefer "aficionado": try everything at least once (unless you categorically know it's not your thing).
759076364305575937 2016-07-29 17:21:22 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest I have the same decision. As one friend put it, which is more likely to happen again, this friend's wedding, or a Misfits reunion?
759073106598113280 2016-07-29 17:08:26 UTC <brainmist> @brainmist and yet I often can't tell people apart or easily recognize them even when they don't look that similar.
759072842986074112 2016-07-29 17:07:23 UTC <brainmist> My prioritization is probably best summed up by the fact that it irritates me that my mom can't correctly name the black Labs in her life...

758067666410024961 2016-07-26 22:33:10 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Eh, we're too hilly for it to make much difference, and the low-lying areas will just shrug and say "Is it already Thursday?"
758067145032867840 2016-07-26 22:31:06 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat It's like CR learned nothing from 2008. *starts raising water* *Realizes at 1"/ hr, she'll never hit flood stage in time*
758066562137858048 2016-07-26 22:28:47 UTC <brainmist> @SubMedina I'm re-watching Fringe, and it's been bingeworthy.  ANd Stranger Things. *ob gush about how it's MORE '80s THAN '80!!!!*
758004027204378624 2016-07-26 18:20:17 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Then you should probably consider how much you'd enjoy future dioramas to be a gray-painted shoebox w/ everyone in orange.
758002755118047232 2016-07-26 18:15:14 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat When you get that feeling, make a diorama of the things that frustrate you and set fire to it.
757985874080505856 2016-07-26 17:08:09 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Hurmmmmm. Is a throwaway tweet somehow worth the loss of goodwill? Especially when other artists will know about it?
757981281149870080 2016-07-26 16:49:54 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat ? What about hymns?
757980885371150336 2016-07-26 16:48:20 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Nope. If you agreed not to display, don't. There is no amount of value in a throwaway tweet to counter breech of trust.
757967327241482240 2016-07-26 15:54:27 UTC <brainmist> @Trillburne @Lamont_Cranst0n So flags representing imperialist nations are fine, as long as they only conquered non-Jewish populations?

757932882023243776 2016-07-26 13:37:35 UTC <brainmist> @AtomicAzalea I feel certain much would change if women occasionally ate the heads of unsatisfactory mates after mating.

757710407825973252 2016-07-25 22:53:33 UTC <brainmist> @LOCAL_GRAVEYARD @MsEntropy The term "Robbers and thieves!" was used.  Twice.
757710117940830213 2016-07-25 22:52:24 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy @LOCAL_GRAVEYARD Yeah, everything I was able to learn about my ancestry in Ireland suggests we were kicked out.
757709521015812096 2016-07-25 22:50:02 UTC <brainmist> @SubMedina Coup? When Trump's done wrecking our economy, we'll be lucky if we can afford a second hand bicycle.

757690126646468608 2016-07-25 21:32:58 UTC <brainmist> @NaheedMustafa I hope so. I imagine the "success" of #Brexit on the back of mass ignorance was an eye opener.

757634792552665089 2016-07-25 17:53:05 UTC <brainmist> @ChuckTingle @Haunted_Backlog Perhaps! Yours are good words. Probably even the best words. Go you!
757571454456049664 2016-07-25 13:41:24 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat And many are repeat offenders.  But they're not racking up tallies of dozens.
757571118936969216 2016-07-25 13:40:04 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Finding studies on rapists who aren't convicted is hard.  There's this one: http://www.davidlisak.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/RepeatRapeinUndetectedRapists.pdf
757555239239114753 2016-07-25 12:36:58 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat And bring up that 1/16 (maybe closer to 1/8) boys grow up to be rapists, or even rape while children. Don't let your son be one.
757554946833199106 2016-07-25 12:35:48 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Maybe we should stop focusing all the attention on  '1/3 (optimistically) women get raped', as if that's something you 'get'....
757552738154651654 2016-07-25 12:27:02 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat We may learn the stats on who was raped. Funny how we never hear "and one turned out  be a rapist".
757551005185613825 2016-07-25 12:20:08 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat And every parent thinks "not my kid".  You want to have a basis for that? Maybe teach your kids not to rape.
757537353724420097 2016-07-25 11:25:54 UTC <brainmist> @ChuckTingle @Haunted_Backlog I mean, self actualize! Yes, I am certain that is what I meant!

756133412264566787 2016-07-21 14:27:08 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat There is no safe way. The male exaggeration of their own humiliation justified killing in their minds.
756128637586288640 2016-07-21 14:08:10 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat As it is, they can dismiss us with impunity: we're stuck trying to guard against their criminal actions, why would they stop?
756128359222874112 2016-07-21 14:07:03 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat I know. Although honestly, I've thought for decades that if men thought random women might kill them, we'd be safer.

756126147054665729 2016-07-21 13:58:16 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat i think any analogy runs aground against the core belief that men are entitled to their selves, and women are not.

755156973985730561 2016-07-18 21:47:07 UTC <brainmist> @CynicalEyebrow Exactly my thought.
755156666602053632 2016-07-18 21:45:54 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest Still a better outcome than a Trump presidency. On the plus, with Trump/ Pence, we've finally found a worse romance than Twilight.
755156373973770240 2016-07-18 21:44:44 UTC <brainmist> Good point.  As much as the conservative attacks on @FLOTUS are sheer hypocrisy, the fault is not Melania Trump's.https://twitter.com/lizlaribee/status/755117250907025408

753692912752271360 2016-07-14 20:49:27 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty True.  It just saddens me how many people assess their own value by how many people they can consider themselves above.
753692227054907392 2016-07-14 20:46:44 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty You have to forgive @AnnCoulter . She went to the Wizard for a heart, but he was out. All she got was undeserved self-worth.
753691283739193344 2016-07-14 20:42:59 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty I think for a lot of people, Islamophobia is a genuine phobia. Culturally induced/ reinforced, but a genuine irrational fear.
753690356319866880 2016-07-14 20:39:18 UTC <brainmist> Wait.  Isn't this just 4 hours of @realDonaldTrump ?https://twitter.com/bobvulfov/status/753627756458545152
753644008086179840 2016-07-14 17:35:08 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Pfft. None of his supporters cares about when he's wrong. He gets fact checked every which way. It didn't matter to them
753622330669019136 2016-07-14 16:08:59 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Sad thing is, "Trump is a loser but as a SCJ I shouldn't say so" should be an intellectual dog whistle. Too few intellectuals.
753621824114561025 2016-07-14 16:06:59 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat What Trump does best is spin things for idiots. He'd have spun this no matter what RBG said.
753621309708341249 2016-07-14 16:04:56 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Right. Because Trump getting to fill her seat would be an improvement. She didn't recant. She didn't say Trump wasn't a loser.
753620951678328832 2016-07-14 16:03:31 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat She also recognizes that if Trump is elected, her voice will be more needed than ever on SCOTUS. And that she can't step down.
753620664448200704 2016-07-14 16:02:22 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Which she did. She's making an official statement that it was out of line, because she doesn't just care about the politics.
753618788520603649 2016-07-14 15:54:55 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Yeah, well, the world's going to get him, for the same reason the UK got Brexit. Go team stupid!
753618544747700225 2016-07-14 15:53:57 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat If she'd said nothing, Trump would find a way to crow about that. It's what he does. You're too smart to fall for this crap.
753618162902376448 2016-07-14 15:52:26 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat @BraddJaffy If Americans are stupid enough to buy spin, memes, & clickbait over actual facts, they deserve the Trump they get.
753616980188336128 2016-07-14 15:47:44 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat She didn't apologize. Where are you seeing an apology?
753616848269160449 2016-07-14 15:47:12 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat "Spin is everything" is the most disappointing confirmation of political cynicism I can imagine. USA: too lazy to fact check.
753616475508748288 2016-07-14 15:45:43 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat She's not doing it for her career. She's appointed: she'll leave when she wants to.
753616083274215424 2016-07-14 15:44:10 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Think of it as a "Sorry not sorry". And better hope she doesn't leave soon: she's the mainstay of the liberal side.
753615606012780546 2016-07-14 15:42:16 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat She didn't apologize, she expressed regret. In her position, any such comment is out of line, affects her ability to sit cases
753614993476550656 2016-07-14 15:39:50 UTC <brainmist> #NotoriousRBG  may regret her criticism of Trump, but I don't. Her fan base includes @BernieSanders supporters. She clarified the stakes.

753365706083672064 2016-07-13 23:09:15 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Sometimes it's just very handy to be able to remove a battery.  Wait.  Is this a metaphor for depression?
753294088200335360 2016-07-13 18:24:40 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Nah, you can blame me. I'm clearly mocking your dick pic.
753290293210861569 2016-07-13 18:09:36 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat That's not "back in the day".  Back in the day, there was only the grue.  Also, I think you meant "8==D"

753232018482139136 2016-07-13 14:18:02 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy Hard to fit that sentiment into a song about a war scene. America the Beautiful has white people bringing freedom and God...

752845510369693697 2016-07-12 12:42:11 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat With enough money, a man can rape pretty much with impunity and immunity. It won't even affect his rep. Look at Trump.
752845236372660230 2016-07-12 12:41:06 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat It's not likely to see conviction here without substantial evidence; even that can fail if the victim can be made to look bad.

752622146950533120 2016-07-11 21:54:37 UTC <brainmist> @TalalNAnsari @MsEntropy @Mikelovespuss69 And meanwhile we let refugee children fleeing those extremists die.  Because "concerns".

752573233313026048 2016-07-11 18:40:15 UTC <brainmist> @Wood_Rocket @AdamBlackhat We need to convince @PatRobertsonTV  it's both a new drug and a perverse sex act.

752571969371987968 2016-07-11 18:35:14 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat @Wood_Rocket global warming is not happening fast enough.  *double fists aerosol*
752571488532729856 2016-07-11 18:33:19 UTC <brainmist> @kylelatino using engineered outrage to silence legitimate outcry when white privilege has actually cost black lives.
752570979453251584 2016-07-11 18:31:18 UTC <brainmist> @kylelatino @kat_the_grape White privilege is not recognizing the hypocrisy of creating fictional accounts of BLM costing white lives 1/2
752545213122433025 2016-07-11 16:48:55 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Lowest common denominator.
752544267415924736 2016-07-11 16:45:09 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty honestly, I'm to the point of just asking 2016 for its terms and surrendering.
752507456807313408 2016-07-11 14:18:53 UTC <brainmist> @JamillaTweets @LibyaLiberty lol. Yeah, switching between devices and platforms does not make Twitter easier.
752507057924812801 2016-07-11 14:17:18 UTC <brainmist> @JamillaTweets @LibyaLiberty Something I'm prone to as well, which is much of why I check up first.
752506887124299776 2016-07-11 14:16:37 UTC <brainmist> @JamillaTweets @LibyaLiberty I figured. It's hard to rein in the followers once that snowball starts rolling down Everest.
752506646174117888 2016-07-11 14:15:40 UTC <brainmist> QOTD:  "Save the Whales!" Does not mean "Fuck the dolphins". (On why 'all lives matter' reaction to BLM is based on a ridiculous premise.)
752500725033213953 2016-07-11 13:52:08 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty @Burhanco This seems like a lot of jumping on someone for absent punctuation on a format that limits characters.
752499865641295872 2016-07-11 13:48:43 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty @JamillaTweets To be fair, reading through his other tweets suggest he's nothing of the sort. He forgot a comma. 140characters

752331078052876293 2016-07-10 02:38:01 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Oh, I am not playing this silly game.  I'm just appalled that I know enough people who are to recognize red as Valor already.

752282402362265600 2016-07-10 23:24:36 UTC <brainmist> Watched a vatican of cardinals drive the blue jays from a favorite spot.  Thought "Go Team Valor!"  Fuck you all.

752203710248345600 2016-07-10 18:11:54 UTC <brainmist> @1971sophia NOT A RANDOM CANADIAN!!! *eyes suspiciously*
752198947263778816 2016-07-10 17:52:58 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy Apparently, though, you give quite the shit. Which, I will confess, I do find entertaining. *waits expectantly*
752198533738995712 2016-07-10 17:51:20 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy Not everyone needs to fall to insults and feeble smack talk. Some of us can simply rest on logic and confidence.
752179938191503360 2016-07-10 16:37:26 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy But no, please continue your public meltdown over someone noting your state. That makes good sense.
752179799112626177 2016-07-10 16:36:53 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy There's nothing inherently wrong about being Californian.... But apparently you see it as an insult.
752179650143526912 2016-07-10 16:36:18 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy You DO see that you are basically filtering my bland comments through your own insecurities, right?
752179398812442626 2016-07-10 16:35:18 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy BWAHAHA!  Oh my.  This is golden.  Sensitivity confirmed.

752174384815583233 2016-07-10 16:15:22 UTC <brainmist> @ThePoke @NaheedMustafa @Sam_R_Hope Modern social media, where one populates one's page w/ others' content, has created a new communication.
752173344712044544 2016-07-10 16:11:14 UTC <brainmist> @ThePoke @NaheedMustafa @Sam_R_Hope People seem to see copying and rebranding as equivalent to creating new content.
752173161613963264 2016-07-10 16:10:31 UTC <brainmist> @Sam_R_Hope @NaheedMustafa @ThePoke I've had a terrible time with grad students plagiarizing: it's like they don't understand the concept.
752171785911611392 2016-07-10 16:05:03 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat or I don't want to do yard work enough...

752166974180954112 2016-07-10 15:45:55 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy But by all means, provide me with more data, sensitive boy.
752166755485622272 2016-07-10 15:45:03 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy Funny how accurate=weak to some. So random conjecture and insults are strength? And now I have more information.
752166409929568256 2016-07-10 15:43:41 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy lol! "Random Californian" is a description, not a critique. Given limited info, it's accurate.
752155492466569217 2016-07-10 15:00:18 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy @allennail @Sadiq_Filastin "Why, -I- don't know several people beheaded by ISIS, therefore no one could!"
752155220369551361 2016-07-10 14:59:13 UTC <brainmist> @MsEntropy I know mansplaining: what's the term for when random Californian insists he knows your area of research better?
752151647929774082 2016-07-10 14:45:01 UTC <brainmist> Well, this explains rather a lot...https://twitter.com/coslive/status/752140553475780608
751854533379182592 2016-07-09 19:04:24 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty I saw Lou Ferrigno at an airport.  I didn't say anything, because I imagine he gets tired of geek adulation.
751556749228814337 2016-07-08 23:21:06 UTC <brainmist> @SubMedina Link?
751556354867761152 2016-07-08 23:19:32 UTC <brainmist> @AndyRichter *headdesk* I think where we start losing our way as a nation is when we fail to teach logical, analytical thought.

751503979197046784 2016-07-08 19:51:25 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat A surprising lot of my conversations end in fire. This is why I'm no longer welcome at book club.

751502786555047936 2016-07-08 19:46:41 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat That seems very uncommitted,  Try being more imperative: "BURN ALL THE THINGS!!!!"
751502557470527488 2016-07-08 19:45:46 UTC <brainmist> @TerryBranstad, let's make sure Iowa never shames its long tradition of prizing liberty by siding with bigotry.https://twitter.com/thinkprogress/status/751496743922139136

751448050720083968 2016-07-08 16:09:11 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat The lament of the old man, outstripped by callow youth.
751447375617466368 2016-07-08 16:06:30 UTC <brainmist> This interview hits so much how the 2nd Amendment may not apply when black. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10209127908210944&id=1116537717
751435133010321408 2016-07-08 15:17:51 UTC <brainmist> Diseases like HIV and zika confirm their belief that God will smite degenerates.  Trans people living happy lives does not.
751434585221701632 2016-07-08 15:15:40 UTC <brainmist> Visibility of transgender people? Might impact their way of life. Heavens, what if their own child came out? Scandal!
751434171394891776 2016-07-08 15:14:02 UTC <brainmist> I know. What I'm saying is that comfortable white bigots aren't afraid of zika, because they don't see it affecting them.
751433067806416896 2016-07-08 15:09:38 UTC <brainmist> That's because zika hasn't killed that many white people. It's like AIDS in the 1980s.
751429247130939392 2016-07-08 14:54:28 UTC <brainmist> Maybe you'd be legal if you wore camo, were strapped to the back of a white supremacist, and were incredibly lethal?

751428415513780224 2016-07-08 14:51:09 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty @lgomorral I think you used the wrong icon. Did you mean
751428147719974912 2016-07-08 14:50:05 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat yeah. Seems like tear gas, hunger, or sleep deprivation could have sufficed. Lethal force- guess this means he was black.
751427508210241536 2016-07-08 14:47:33 UTC <brainmist> @JessicaTaylor @yamainu @realDonaldTrump I'm guessing this was written for him. Give him some time in front of his usual audience.
751426154851028992 2016-07-08 14:42:10 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty @AayatBak @abhikroy84 Both SA and SW are taking away women's freedom to express themselves. This is not a gift.
751425979701088258 2016-07-08 14:41:29 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty @AayatBak @abhikroy84 it takes away a woman's right to choose what she wears, whether they require the burqa or ban it.
751302572711915520 2016-07-07 06:31:06 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty For a horrifying moment, I thought that might be meant as naked Trump.  But no fiberglass hair.

751171294712868864 2016-07-07 21:49:27 UTC <brainmist> @vareeditandweep @AdamBlackhat @TheBlackWolf94 Inscrutable sass! Huge amounts of inscrutable sass!

751170588870254592 2016-07-07 21:46:39 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat NO.
751170387593932801 2016-07-07 21:45:51 UTC <brainmist> @vareeditandweep @AdamBlackhat @TheBlackWolf94 It is a lie. The road to hell is paved with butter brickle.
751163288373727232 2016-07-07 21:17:38 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat Have a good one! And buck up!
751163200402436096 2016-07-07 21:17:17 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat And of you read the comments, readers often have questions.
751163084866138115 2016-07-07 21:16:50 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat it works page by page, yet forms a cohesive whole, ideal for eventual publication.
751162975013048321 2016-07-07 21:16:23 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat #Gunnerkrigg is amazing, and also, I think, a good model. Artistry changed at first, but now it's practiced.
751162678454792192 2016-07-07 21:15:13 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat Like writing style. Someone who writes short sentences can break paragraphs down. Long sentences? Not so much.
751162390561959940 2016-07-07 21:14:04 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat Argh. Bookmarking. Not nominating.
751162312015245312 2016-07-07 21:13:45 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat I'd go with whatever fits your story style best.  If you compose in one page chunks, distribute by page.
751162051045666816 2016-07-07 21:12:43 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat You get used to mental nominating and waiting a few days.
751161993504038912 2016-07-07 21:12:29 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat I think the flow is pretty reasonable, but I've been reading Gunnerkrigg for a while.
751161561452908544 2016-07-07 21:10:46 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat Maybe? Pants and briefs. I think you have this covered.
751161283953569793 2016-07-07 21:09:40 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat while Netflix is killing people's ability to wait until next week, as they're now trained to binge.
751161101618778112 2016-07-07 21:08:57 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat the interesting thing is, comics are moving to page by page (a format formerly seen in newspapers/periodicals)
751160771376140288 2016-07-07 21:07:38 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat IT will be OK. Worst case, you post a brief explanation.
751160514529550337 2016-07-07 21:06:37 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat And yes, you can call me friend. Inasmuch as cats can be.
751160440583884801 2016-07-07 21:06:19 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat it's because I am a rare one with thumbs. That also explains the magic.
751160130847141888 2016-07-07 21:05:05 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat And pants are important for the retention of dignity. Really, humans, grow some fur!
751159732547756032 2016-07-07 21:03:30 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat That too. I am many glorious things. *preen* Possibly also a cat.
751159498966913024 2016-07-07 21:02:35 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat @TheBlackWolf94 If anything, you're supposed to leave your audience unresolved. That makes them tune in next week.
751159072183820288 2016-07-07 21:00:53 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat Dude. As your friend, or at least vague online acquaintance, please let me stress the importance of pants.
751158776330276864 2016-07-07 20:59:42 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat *preen* Because I'm clever, thoughtful, and appreciative of your work?
751158551746273280 2016-07-07 20:58:49 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat (Maybe they should work on the pants thing)
751135337963892736 2016-07-07 19:26:34 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Your options are to nerf the comic by providing immediate resolution, hold release, or hope your readers can keep pants on.
751134984598007808 2016-07-07 19:25:10 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat People get used to being able to turn a page and resolve confusion. But that isn't an option w page by page release.
751134059053477888 2016-07-07 19:21:29 UTC <brainmist> @rachelswirsky Still not broad enough. "Trying to make a point while not being cis/het/white/male/Christian/'normal'

751108285860761600 2016-07-07 17:39:04 UTC <brainmist> @TheGoodGodAbove Dear God, I know I asked for the opposite in the 80s; i still had optimism then. Could you please speed up global warming?
751084276041412608 2016-07-07 16:03:40 UTC <brainmist> @BathysphereHat But I understand the distress of those who cannot avoid it and the frustration that there are those who can.
751083855294050304 2016-07-07 16:02:00 UTC <brainmist> @BathysphereHat I also think that it's rational to take a break when you're breaking. How can you fight with nothing left?
751083556420538368 2016-07-07 16:00:48 UTC <brainmist> @BathysphereHat I do agree, in the media it's usually about clicks. Sensationalism rules:  if it bleeds, it leads.
751082946866532352 2016-07-07 15:58:23 UTC <brainmist> @BathysphereHat Someone on FB: "Lucky you, to be able to just turn off the racism in your life, if even for just a moment."
751082295403044864 2016-07-07 15:55:48 UTC <brainmist> @BathysphereHat Do they need pictures to be seeing it? It's their every day.
751081596535484417 2016-07-07 15:53:01 UTC <brainmist> @BathysphereHat To require those who benefit, directly or indirectly, or can ignore, to see the cost in blood. 2/2
751081171262382080 2016-07-07 15:51:20 UTC <brainmist> @BathysphereHat I think that's part of the intent, like marching German locals through Auschwitz. 1/2
751079833405263872 2016-07-07 15:46:01 UTC <brainmist> @BathysphereHat But when the public is already desensitized, are they watching for entertainment? Probably some are.
751079670917902336 2016-07-07 15:45:22 UTC <brainmist> @BathysphereHat I see a lot of it being sent around by activists first. I think the hope is to shock people into action.

751045315436830720 2016-07-07 13:28:51 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty @Hebsevenfour @latimes Um. Toddlers ARE frequently armed. Or at least have enough access to have shot 23 people this year.
751044469084950528 2016-07-07 13:25:29 UTC <brainmist> @Aphemia66 @SubMedina Funny how when a cop commits murder, he's only "involved".

751040646991843328 2016-07-07 13:10:18 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty @count_01 Usually I'm immediately swamped with indignant "I'm not a bear!"  So you say, bear. So you say.
751040352572678148 2016-07-07 13:09:08 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty @count_01 This is the analogy I use when trying to explain what it's like to be a woman in nation where 1/3 to 1/2 are raped.

746469006698119169 2016-06-24 22:24:14 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Ah.  SO the death of GB.  As a descendant of the Famines, I'm not entirely sad to see them done in by their imperialist hubris.
746468654259154949 2016-06-24 22:22:50 UTC <brainmist> Hands down, the best thing about Brexit is watching a highly incensed Scotland rain down creative new invectives on @realDonaldTrump.

745656441789243392 2016-06-22 16:35:24 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat The only cherry to top this cake of awful would be if Ivy seduces underage Bruce, and Alfred congrats him on becoming a man.

744930725514731520 2016-06-20 16:31:39 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Anyway. Perhaps the crime is technically larceny. But I imagine it feels like rape.
744930248588853248 2016-06-20 16:29:46 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat And entertainers have the option of bouncing at their discretion.  Control given to those at risk and working=less exploitation
744929882891640833 2016-06-20 16:28:18 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat I would definitely prefer to see prosperity run as legal entertainment. Pay up front, follow house rules, or bounced/ no refund.
744928818192756736 2016-06-20 16:24:05 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat legally? Emotionally? Is a reneged deal to pay for sex not to some degree coercion for sex the guy would otherwise not get?
744928021866438656 2016-06-20 16:20:55 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat They're being taken advantage of to some degree from the start, and now cheated of money as well.
744927742341193728 2016-06-20 16:19:48 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Relative power matters too. In the case of illegal prostitution, how much power does the prostitute have? Almost certainly less.
744927013937381377 2016-06-20 16:16:54 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Prostitution gets tricky: if owed money is taken from a john who reneges on the deal, it has lesser weight than if sex is taken.
744917750301110272 2016-06-20 15:40:06 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Is the crime the act or the relative harm?
744715643811880960 2016-06-19 02:17:00 UTC <brainmist> @RiotFest 1. You're not seeing two people: you're seeing double. 2. That's a mirror. 3. Uber.

741023996980797440 2016-06-09 21:47:43 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Eh, Gracie Allen beat her to the historic punch. I just think apathy makes it too easy not to vote. Apathy=Trump.
741023719913492481 2016-06-09 21:46:37 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat She also pushed for universal healthcare in the '90s, and has a better understanding that we're in this together than Trump.
741017443674398720 2016-06-09 21:21:40 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 10. Any current world leader other than Putin and Kim Jong Il. After all, those two support Trump.  Ick.
741017227126706176 2016-06-09 21:20:49 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 9. Hamburger Helper, because its ....hand....isn't so tiny, and it's certainly more helpful.
741016984351956992 2016-06-09 21:19:51 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 8. Chucky from Child's Play, because it's less malicious, more rational, and its hair is more realistic.
741015382228537344 2016-06-09 21:13:29 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 7. The word "cunt", because it's less insulting to women.
741014743155015684 2016-06-09 21:10:56 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 6. Osama bin Laden. Being dead, his ability to do harm is negligible, unlike Trump.
741014248466178048 2016-06-09 21:08:58 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 5. Mexico. The country. Because when it comes to this wall issue, they're not talking nonsense.
741013704259469312 2016-06-09 21:06:49 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 4. Reruns of Amos and Andy, because the racism was less appalling.
741012638516154368 2016-06-09 21:02:35 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 3. A tank full of leeches (which have limits to their leeching, unlike Trump)
741012242187984896 2016-06-09 21:01:00 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 2. An actual pile of shit in a wig (as opposed to a metaphorical pile of shit in a wig)
741012088852598786 2016-06-09 21:00:23 UTC <brainmist> A competent, experienced candidate in @HillaryClinton. Or @realDonaldTrump. Obvs voting Clinton...but what else would you rather? 1. A pig
741010777994199040 2016-06-09 20:55:11 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat This may not be your favorite, but she still represents you. @realDonaldTrump represents bigoted hateful world-burning morons.

740985391713386496 2016-06-09 19:14:18 UTC <brainmist> @brainmist What I guarantee is that it will in no way help your cancer, no matter how many superstitious, ignorant people insist it can.
740985229666439168 2016-06-09 19:13:40 UTC <brainmist> @brainmist At worst it shits all over everything and gores you because it's bored, all while you're trying to deal with cancer.
740985030239883264 2016-06-09 19:12:52 UTC <brainmist> @brainmist Still, it's a pig. At best, it annoys the hell out of the neighbors (your Muslim neighbors stop visiting and kinda hope you die.)
740984779663761408 2016-06-09 19:11:52 UTC <brainmist> @brainmist It's frankly outrageous that a hospital would even have a pig on staff. Surely they know it's incompetent. But it seems popular.
740984484527407104 2016-06-09 19:10:42 UTC <brainmist> @brainmist Worse yet, will you keep demanding your original choice, taking the chance your insurance will just assign you the pig?
740984300049334273 2016-06-09 19:09:58 UTC <brainmist> @brainmist You know you can't have the MD you wanted: your choices now are a cold but competent MD and a pig. Are you really equating these?
740984041332051968 2016-06-09 19:08:56 UTC <brainmist> I keep seeing people equating Clinton & Trump.  In my mind, this is like trying to choose an MD to handle a slow but progressing cancer. 1/2

740581623041687553 2016-06-08 16:29:52 UTC <brainmist> @BernieSanders @AdamBlackhat I'm hoping she invites him to be her VP.  Because I think plenty of overly optimistic people would write in.

739834472762200064 2016-06-06 15:00:58 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat I'd love one where the heroine is getting out of costume & gripes about the demand of public expectations.
739834205408890880 2016-06-06 14:59:54 UTC <brainmist> @TheBlackWolf94 @AdamBlackhat Hey, there are sexy costumes and good butts in the world. But it's not everyone.

739832039591944192 2016-06-06 14:51:18 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Lovely! Stay classy, Twitter!
739828206237155328 2016-06-06 14:36:04 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat Well, now you've done it. You've got a Titscreeper (TM).

739826518214348800 2016-06-06 14:29:21 UTC <brainmist> @yamainu @4Dfruitbat The tits are always greener on the other side of the bra. Hm. Actually, you should probably get that looked at.
739826051505754113 2016-06-06 14:27:30 UTC <brainmist> @HarrisonSmith85 I love that the psychological vs supernatural is left unresolved. Mia Farrow nails it; Rosemary's Baby felt a bit forced.
739825531495931904 2016-06-06 14:25:26 UTC <brainmist> @HarrisonSmith85 I think The Haunting of Julia is the best depiction of overwhelming grief to the point of wishing for possession;
739825087025545217 2016-06-06 14:23:40 UTC <brainmist> @HarrisonSmith85 Ditto, although I think the first two hold up better within their context. Some of those old 50s/60s films are just... Bad.
739824154090708995 2016-06-06 14:19:58 UTC <brainmist> @lexianlily OK, now I feel like I may be being offensive to bulls.
739824028312047616 2016-06-06 14:19:28 UTC <brainmist> @lexianlily 'I know the best bulls... Those bulls are yuge!! And I'm going to pump that semen and make the bulls pay for it.'
739823668293836800 2016-06-06 14:18:02 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat I have an image, but I'm pretty certain that this is a lab procedure, not naked Cheryl running with Petri dishes.
739823235932377088 2016-06-06 14:16:19 UTC <brainmist> @HarrisonSmith85 And I still had to triple check names.  It gets confusing.
739823136783228928 2016-06-06 14:15:55 UTC <brainmist> @HarrisonSmith85 Heh. I'm fond of both Legend of Hell House and The Haunting (and Changeling, and have you seen The Haunting of Julia)?
739822798994956288 2016-06-06 14:14:35 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat That seems a reasonable concern. *eyes tits suspiciously*
739822544086126597 2016-06-06 14:13:34 UTC <brainmist> @lexianlily Someone should ask him if it's true he's injected with mediocre bull semen: he might kneejerk to 'the best semen'
739821887128100864 2016-06-06 14:10:57 UTC <brainmist> @HarrisonSmith85 Did you mean to reference The Haunting of Hell House, 1999? Or possibly the Legend of Hell House, 1973?
739817966527598592 2016-06-06 13:55:23 UTC <brainmist> @lexianlily Ineffectually, in the long term. This actually seems like a strategy we'd see used today. Don't tell Trump.
739816301661585409 2016-06-06 13:48:46 UTC <brainmist> @lexianlily To be fair, that strategy for achieving greatness worked for Katherine the Great.

739512125568090112 2016-06-05 17:40:04 UTC <brainmist> Yes, what a tragedy it is that the perpetrator should face some consequences, instead of just the victim.https://twitter.com/JillPantozzi/status/739506625103400960

736529374824923136 2016-05-28 12:07:41 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump #ChickenTrump #Trumpducken 9. Tiny wings look completely ridiculous; 10. Looks even less appetizing if it's #Berned.
736528234188177408 2016-05-28 12:03:09 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump #Trumpducken #ChickenTrump  7. Greasy, but not as rich as you'd expect. 8. Stupid people believe it got there on its own.
736527951030689793 2016-05-28 12:02:02 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump #Trumpducken #ChickenTrump  6. Most of the world is pretty appalled we'd even consider it, much less go through with it.
736526958595473408 2016-05-28 11:58:05 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump #Trumpducken #ChickenTrump  5. Might be an amusing novelty, but try swallowing that every day?
736526435716763648 2016-05-28 11:56:00 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump 4. Claims it'd feed a lot of hungry people, but really serves only a few rich people who had it custom ordered.
736526142782345218 2016-05-28 11:54:51 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump #Trumpducken #ChickenTrump  2. But if you're looking for backbone, you won't find one. 3. Too much makes you nauseous.
736525720260775936 2016-05-28 11:53:10 UTC <brainmist> @realDonaldTrump But #ChickenTrump ignores the potential of #Trumpducken: 1. He's overstuffed and more than a little foul;
736525271403110400 2016-05-28 11:51:23 UTC <brainmist> I get keeping things simple for @realDonaldTrump -he's so confused he thinks Mexico pays when we build, and clearly can't read Constitution.
736267100935753728 2016-05-27 18:45:30 UTC <brainmist> My current friendship style is basically @RiotFest : I demand they do responsible stuff and bribe with promises of future music-based fun.
736247705811312645 2016-05-27 17:28:26 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty Hot Pockets = food terrorism, OTOH....
736247603013160962 2016-05-27 17:28:02 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty (I feel like, this being the net, I should include a standard disclaimer that I don't think IEDs or war are remotely funny)
736239355287592960 2016-05-27 16:55:15 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty The parallels to IEDs are uncanny: 1. They look like a chunk of desert road 2. They explode unexpectedly and burn like hell.
735939308494848000 2016-05-26 21:02:58 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Pretty much the world is my disgusting Aesop.  Seriously, humans.  WTF.  What the ever-loving fuck.
735937108318117888 2016-05-26 20:54:14 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Suck experiences can sometimes be highly educational.  Myself, I'd rather learn vicariously. *scribbles notes* "No strippers"
735936526861770753 2016-05-26 20:51:55 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Welp, I'm just tallying this in the "WTF is wrong with humans?" category.  It's a pretty extensive category.
735936127618535424 2016-05-26 20:50:20 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Gah.  I'm sorry that happened to you.  And her.  Yes, I know, you both agreed to it.  But societal coercion is coercion.
735934003832754177 2016-05-26 20:41:54 UTC <brainmist> @radbrowndads Meanwhile, my dad has been patiently waiting for someone to offer him two sheep for my hand.
735933474851328000 2016-05-26 20:39:48 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat This is part of where guys develop the idea that women being bored during sexy times is normal, isn't it.
735933187314974720 2016-05-26 20:38:39 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Except of course that animals don't typically pull this crap.  So it was pretty much a humanizing experience.
735933036441653248 2016-05-26 20:38:03 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Right???  Ack.  I feel like I should apologize for the current culture putting both of you in such a dehumanizing position.
735932789858541570 2016-05-26 20:37:04 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Blah. I am making such a face right now. Kinda like this but more disbelieving horror.pic.twitter.com/gIati9asRy

735931277270880256 2016-05-26 20:31:04 UTC <brainmist> @AdamBlackhat Human rituals are bizarre. What was the purpose of this one? I mean, I get that it's meant to embody sexual interest....

735886108769165312 2016-05-26 17:31:35 UTC <brainmist> @CenturyLinkHelp Online assistance has boiled down to "It can't be us, so you must not have things connected right or something".

721590029093511169 2016-04-16 06:44:04 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty Can we maybe have an option if we're embarrassed to fly with histrionic white people?
721589764982345728 2016-04-16 06:43:01 UTC <brainmist> @LibyaLiberty Wouldn't it be simpler to have a separate plane for racist white people? You'd only need 1 alternate route.  Destination:1950s

720296495602204672 2016-04-13 17:04:01 UTC <brainmist> @4Dfruitbat they do have this intensely annoying tendency to pop up old posts. Then they ask you if you want fewer. Then they show more.

718462509364039680 2016-04-08 15:36:25 UTC <brainmist> @kat_the_grape Might still be worth checking out some styles. Unfortunately, comfy heels are almost oxymoronic in women's shoes.

718336083998744576 2016-04-08 07:14:03 UTC <brainmist> @kat_the_grape And increasingly there seems to be a trend towards unisex, which means larger sizes in styles that are neutral.
718334686813163520 2016-04-08 07:08:30 UTC <brainmist> @kat_the_grape They won't be as stylish, but historically, style has leaned towards foot damage.
718334425096957956 2016-04-08 07:07:27 UTC <brainmist> @kat_the_grape Try shoes made for nurses.  You can get some nice ones in leather with flexible soles and cushioning.

707700272923934721 2016-03-09 22:51:08 UTC <brainmist> @Harebrained247 That would actually be a great promo to encourage women to get annual checkups, which can be uncomfortable but life-saving.
