969629834560368642 2018-03-02 17:45:42 UTC <ErikaSYou> @stoptheageists I imagine this has something to do with my tide pod joke a week or so ago. FFS lighten up. Its not ageist to say teens shouldnt vote.
969561239830614016 2018-03-02 13:13:07 UTC <ErikaSYou> @JuddLegum Just dont expect a warranty.

968906494413590528 2018-02-28 17:51:24 UTC <ErikaSYou> @benshapiro Way to intentionally miss the point there, Ben.
967080405965918208 2018-02-23 16:55:10 UTC <ErikaSYou> @RadioFreeTom Well said
966471309369593856 2018-02-21 00:34:50 UTC <ErikaSYou> @ReaganBattalion Which part would be the lie? Did he not say those words? Were they not at his office? Were they not chanting?
966012137331142656 2018-02-20 18:10:15 UTC <ErikaSYou> @leftyjennyc Aw, Jennifer, Im sorry. 
965772550398717952 2018-02-19 02:18:13 UTC <ErikaSYou> @CNNOpinion @CNN Calm the hell down, CNN. Teenagers shouldnt vote. They were eating Tide pods last week.

964361972304158720 2018-02-15 04:53:05 UTC <ErikaSYou> @chrislhayes @AJentleson Ban assault rifles and bump stocks, get some regulation or at least accountability on social media, figure out how to break the pattern of toxic masculinity in our boys. (Thats the hardest one to figure out, but without it, gun control alone wont solve it.) How? God, who knows?
963938332643295232 2018-02-14 00:49:42 UTC <ErikaSYou> @ReaganBattalion Yes. Exactly this.
963745803939516416 2018-02-14 12:04:39 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BillyBaldwin Nope. No bottom there.
963483271723134976 2018-02-13 18:41:27 UTC <ErikaSYou> @RadioFreeTom Not a Kelly fan lately, but he MUST stay. Any replacement would be worse.

961288595645587456 2018-02-07 17:20:35 UTC <ErikaSYou> @ReaganBattalion Maybe save lying down in front of tanks for something important, not to protest a parade - no matter how dumb the parade is.

954413651062153218 2018-01-19 18:02:01 UTC <ErikaSYou> @ReaganBattalion Maybe Graham can phone in a quick flattery call right after Schumer leaves, since thats how this apparently works now.

949435659818815490 2018-01-05 00:21:15 UTC <ErikaSYou> @nadabakos It sounds like some royalty-free pop music Id download off the web for marketing.Probably the last thing Nirvana should sound like.
949315188217602050 2018-01-05 16:22:32 UTC <ErikaSYou> @JeffFlake Really? Youre gonna be deeply disturbed? Youve become a caricature, not even real anymore.
949261482079981568 2018-01-05 12:49:08 UTC <ErikaSYou> @ReaganBattalion I hope youre right and that you guys can save your party. Id rather put up with it than lose it for whats passing as conservatism these days.
948956708956786689 2018-01-04 16:38:04 UTC <ErikaSYou> My first reaction to the headline was that this is because of Sessions newfound disregard for states rights. For once, Russia didnt even occur to me.
948950581405798401 2018-01-04 16:13:43 UTC <ErikaSYou> @hardhouz13 @Donny_B26 Ha! Same all around.

947595897315217409 2017-12-31 22:30:42 UTC <ErikaSYou> @nytimes Wow! This is one BS headline!

944711274163851267 2017-12-23 23:28:14 UTC <ErikaSYou> @hardhouz13 She makes insane claims that people who are desperate for this all to end want to hear. Its very tempting. She loses followers too once they wake up to the bs. You do you, Baba. Your way is better. 
944257661406711810 2017-12-22 17:25:44 UTC <ErikaSYou> @TPM So their Senate majority all but dries up and theyre facing what they describe as a bloodbath in the House next year. So now McConnell is all hey we LOVE bipartisanship!!!
944256136307408896 2017-12-22 17:19:40 UTC <ErikaSYou> @AngryBlackLady Had to get in on this. We rescued our min pin Sammy when he was just a year old. Here he is at age 12, the best good boy ever.pic.twitter.com/5GIpwc0nx4
944189535679926272 2017-12-22 12:55:02 UTC <ErikaSYou> @JeffFlake Your party is SHUTTING DEMOCRATS OUT COMPLETELY. They represent half the country. Your partys unwillingness to work with blue Senators is whats hurting democracy. We have a right for our voices to be heard!
944179015912443904 2017-12-22 12:13:14 UTC <ErikaSYou> @KatTimpf Pick up a Christopher Moore book at the bookstore and get comfy.
943950657488289792 2017-12-21 21:05:49 UTC <ErikaSYou> @ReaganBattalion Can you imagine the horror? Those two are made for each other.

A Democrat took their Alabama seat and hurt their majority. Senate Rs are ALL about bipartisanship now.
943832643589804032 2017-12-21 13:16:52 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse YES! Instead of helping hard-working middle class American families, Ben is sharing all our money with the millionaires in his neighborhood; you know, his neighbors.
943825412580433921 2017-12-21 12:48:08 UTC <ErikaSYou> @marcorubio You need to be reading these yourself, Senator. You might learn a thing or two.

943574214413619200 2017-12-20 20:09:58 UTC <ErikaSYou> @marcorubio Dont pass a sweeping tax bill that gives my money to your donors. Damn! Too late.
943470460498579456 2017-12-20 13:17:41 UTC <ErikaSYou> @marcorubio Super nice statement. Your actions have hurt working American families for the benefit of wealthy foreign and domestic investors.

939964028285308932 2017-12-10 21:04:22 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BarackObama @MarkRuffalo Mark thats literally the opposite of what would help. Alabamans dont Love Obama. Need a respected Republican.

938801891533905921 2017-12-07 16:06:27 UTC <ErikaSYou> @hardhouz13 Baba find a men's group in AA. It helps. This week is 4.5 years sober for me.  You can do it.
938537064240418818 2017-12-06 22:34:07 UTC <ErikaSYou> @OliviaMesser Same, Liberty. Same.
938393322141384704 2017-12-06 13:02:57 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse Hollow words, Senator, when you equate Jones to Moore.

938203952121868288 2017-12-05 00:30:27 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse As partisan as McConnell. Can't choose between an accused child molester twice removed from the bench for ignoring the law and a Democrat?!

937854508222345216 2017-12-04 01:21:53 UTC <ErikaSYou> @roxydavis99 Fair enough. But if they STILL support him, I am making NO effort to sway them. Like @RadioFreeTom, I'm going the Mock and Shame route.

937751648453177344 2017-12-04 18:33:10 UTC <ErikaSYou> @SenJohnMcCain At least your priorities are straight. Maybe your donors can buy you some bots as a thank you for pulling the rug out from American workers!
937563164962639872 2017-12-03 06:04:12 UTC <ErikaSYou> @xnulz My grandmother was a freedom fighter in Hungary pre-revolution. She could shoot to kill soldiers from the back of a motorcycle.
937443478740586496 2017-12-03 22:08:36 UTC <ErikaSYou> @thehill So to be fair, we just gave it to the rich guys. So much easier!
937345446208557062 2017-12-03 15:39:04 UTC <ErikaSYou> @emills28 Yeah McConnell is now ready to seat Roy Moore. They won't do anything to Trump.
937099856736391168 2017-12-02 23:23:10 UTC <ErikaSYou> @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ReaganBattalion And promptly gave up the minute it was a little bit inconvenient.
937099188713742339 2017-12-02 23:20:31 UTC <ErikaSYou> @SenMikeLee @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ReaganBattalion He barely made an effort. When his amendment failed, he immediately gave up on families and handed everything to donors.
937075011021627393 2017-12-02 21:44:27 UTC <ErikaSYou> @UCF_Football @marcorubio So much for all those "working families", huh? You abandoned them and went ahead and voted yes on the bill.
937073724079124482 2017-12-02 21:39:20 UTC <ErikaSYou> @thehill Spoiler: it didn't. He'll be fine. They'll protect him no matter what he does

936983927184556032 2017-12-02 15:42:31 UTC <ErikaSYou> @ReaganBattalion THIS BILL FAILS AMERICA BUT RUBIO VOTED YES ANYWAY. RUBIO FAILED AMERICAN FAMILIES.
936982959286038528 2017-12-02 15:38:40 UTC <ErikaSYou> @LindseyGrahamSC May you and the donors you serve never have a moment's peace you greedy old bastard.
936982688447201282 2017-12-02 15:37:35 UTC <ErikaSYou> @senorrinhatch Which people? The wealthy people. Which people? Your donors. Gotta have your money money money money money money money. Fuck US, amirite?
936436077933617152 2017-11-30 03:25:33 UTC <ErikaSYou> @tcwittes @SteveSchmidtSES I have been yelling about this to my three teenage kids all week. I am pissed.

936358058711711750 2017-11-30 22:15:32 UTC <ErikaSYou> @lynnv378 @Frisco_Star Haha nope that was your guys that did that. Dems didn't get a say in this thing at all!
936328293137158145 2017-11-30 20:17:15 UTC <ErikaSYou> @ReaganBattalion No. Your party CHOOSING TRUMP is how we got Trump.

913837911237431297 2017-09-29 18:48:30 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse @IamRobertWalton @TreEdie35 Seems fair
913827506779824128 2017-09-29 18:07:10 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse @IamRobertWalton @ArtieMacfarley "Finding common ground is like thanking Manson." I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one.
913825104903245826 2017-09-29 17:57:37 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse @IamRobertWalton @ArtieMacfarley I'm amazed that agreeing with someone who says Richard Spencer is a tool would be so controversial.
913824178960306176 2017-09-29 17:53:56 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse @IamRobertWalton @ArtieMacfarley Agree when they do right. Call them out when they're wrong. That's all I'm saying. His response to Spencer was right. Then we build on that.
913821361482674176 2017-09-29 17:42:45 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse @IamRobertWalton @ArtieMacfarley Did you forget what the original post was even about? He does something right but you won't accept it cuz it's not everything.
913816041431629824 2017-09-29 17:21:36 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse @IamRobertWalton @ArtieMacfarley I do believe he has USA best interests at heart, we just disagree on what that is. But for Sasse specifically, I don't doubt his motives.
913815664858746880 2017-09-29 17:20:07 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse @IamRobertWalton @ArtieMacfarley We can agree on some things even if we don't agree on everything. It doesn't have to be all or nothing.
913815522659241985 2017-09-29 17:19:33 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse @IamRobertWalton @ArtieMacfarley R's have always done that. That's where D's should stand their ground and not compromise. But his response to spencer is common ground.
913811160146874369 2017-09-29 17:02:13 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse @IamRobertWalton @ILoveSlaw Agree re Spencer - and speaking truth to power. But common ground with the other side where we can find it is a good thing.

913521419224526851 2017-09-28 21:50:53 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse @IamRobertWalton When there's something we can agree on, we should embrace that, not qualify it. Country needs to heal. Build bridges where we can.

910677461087789056 2017-09-20 01:30:00 UTC <ErikaSYou> @TheRickWilson Lol - What Fast Times did to teenage boys - every man your age will  Phoebe Cates forever!
907709562005934080 2017-09-12 20:56:38 UTC <ErikaSYou> @MeghanMcCain May God bless you, your father, and your family as you battle this awful disease together. 
905952253248499713 2017-09-07 00:33:43 UTC <ErikaSYou> @ReaganBattalion Your party picked him. Your leaders endorsed him last summer. You gave him the nom, Dems didn't. He's yours. ALL yours. We don't want him.
905944988533616640 2017-09-07 00:04:51 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse Awwww 
905920442124443649 2017-09-07 22:27:19 UTC <ErikaSYou> @TeaPainUSA #FollowMeTea - You're one of the few accounts I check when I'm super short in time.
905907114023034880 2017-09-07 21:34:21 UTC <ErikaSYou> @RawStory @taylordissensus The details didn't matter. They were proud of it. These are 44 year-old women too - old classmates on FB. I can't explain them.
905902102471479296 2017-09-07 21:14:26 UTC <ErikaSYou> @RawStory Not true. I know some trump fans who LOVED how badass it made them look - "making libtards cry" and all that. 
905899704327790593 2017-09-07 21:04:54 UTC <ErikaSYou> @TheRickWilson Guys, he's going to stand her up at the last minute.

905794904210763776 2017-09-07 14:08:28 UTC <ErikaSYou> @ReaganBattalion No thanks. He's all yours.
905764853234769920 2017-09-07 12:09:03 UTC <ErikaSYou> @TheRickWilson We won't have him
905619833131327488 2017-09-06 02:32:48 UTC <ErikaSYou> @BenSasse Broccoli is delicious. Eat your vegetables, Senator.
905384814492225536 2017-09-06 10:58:55 UTC <ErikaSYou> @LouiseMensch @roblee4 Thank you for your courage, Pastor. This  country needs you. God bless. 
905221674190213120 2017-09-05 00:10:39 UTC <ErikaSYou> @RawStory @zrod182 How did his 'good policies' work out for you? He is the one who said he's not a Dem. He should stop trying to hijack the party.
905203575512555522 2017-09-05 22:58:44 UTC <ErikaSYou> @RawStory STOP SAYING BERNIE IS A DEMOCRAT. BERNIE ISN'T A DEMOCRAT.

904356335717949440 2017-09-03 14:52:07 UTC <ErikaSYou> @tcwittes Same. I don't understand the little shoulder cutouts on all the tops. It's like farmer tan has a fashionable cousin.
903719335012728833 2017-09-01 20:40:54 UTC <ErikaSYou> Best of luck, Albus!! And thank you @jk_rowling for giving us this wonderful world to visit whenever we want.

902502693780037633 2017-08-29 12:06:24 UTC <ErikaSYou> @thehill Wait, wasn't the reason Ted Cruz said he voted against aid for Sandy? Because the bill was tied to other spending? Will he vote yes on this?
901815854224068608 2017-08-27 14:37:09 UTC <ErikaSYou> @jules_su Go sports!
901143608451117057 2017-08-25 18:05:53 UTC <ErikaSYou> @mitchellvii @KingBee0102 My point is nobody is happily waiting for Texans to be hurt just so there's another thing to blame on Trump.
901138324110401537 2017-08-25 17:44:53 UTC <ErikaSYou> @mitchellvii @KingBee0102 Yes I see they specifically listed the things he hasn't done. Also, not playing.
