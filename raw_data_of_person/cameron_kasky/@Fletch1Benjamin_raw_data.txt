972127180942643200 2018-03-09 15:09:15 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @sarahchad_ @DLoesch @NRA @AdeMontignie @TrickFreee Well done students, how can we help do more!!
972107574224007168 2018-03-09 13:51:21 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @cameron_kasky Excellent words and certainly something a totally new congress could try but we would have to remove decades old leadership who are buried if strife and unwilling to compromise on anything.
971900818956931072 2018-03-08 00:09:46 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate Another indication of the sad state of affairs for the people of this country but do they care?  Does the media care?
971900078049910786 2018-03-08 00:06:50 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Perhaps everyone needs to stand up to the administration on immigration and all other topics.  This administration is not fit to serve.
971889967701069825 2018-03-08 23:26:39 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @StinaSternberg Yes, a really bad episode.
971889263632699392 2018-03-08 23:23:51 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics The real question is if they hear it will America care.  The stuff the administration has gotten away with so far has fallen on deaf ears because of how it is reported.  So what makes this different.  Perhaps in Nov we can finally get back to being a nation united versus one not!
971887461642141696 2018-03-08 23:16:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNBC The US has no allies at the moment.  Check back when the right wing government in Italy is sworn in.  Sound familiar??
971774421814927360 2018-03-08 15:47:31 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espngolic @wingoz @NDmom Perhaps as a change of pace you should be Wingos partner anyway.  Probably a fresh take would be fun!!! Just sayin. Enjoy the vacation #sharkbait
971535894661484545 2018-03-07 23:59:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @cameron_kasky Here here, well said and thank you.  More Americans need to understand what you said.  We have become beholden to a small group with big dollars and that must change.  Keep preaching it and people will listen.
971535212982267904 2018-03-07 23:56:59 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @longlivekcx Probably flew first class as well on our nickel!!
971535098679119872 2018-03-07 23:56:32 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @longlivekcx Then why go.  As a grand stand ploy that will not work.  This administration is heartless, cruel and uncivil.  This administration needs to go as soon as possible and congressional leadership along with it.  We need leaders who believe country first. Just terrible.
971534308602195970 2018-03-07 23:53:24 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Please send this to every member of the NRA and let them here what democracy sounds like.
971384447114403841 2018-03-07 13:57:54 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BettyBowers Vote him out!!
971383916341944320 2018-03-07 13:55:47 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC It will be a very flimsy spear if he is the tip. Just sayin
970788365669986304 2018-03-05 22:29:17 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @AdeMontignie @michellemalkin Has Marshall Law been declared? Is this verified?
970686486898147329 2018-03-05 15:44:27 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN A new week but the same bland journalism.  When are you going to step it up CNN and take a Watergate stance to what is happening in our nation.  Forgo ratings and provide the proper window on the world you claim to!!
970673110834991104 2018-03-05 14:51:18 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BettyBowers @Twitter Why are these tweets consistently unavailable.  The nation should see them...all of them.
970649898638102528 2018-03-05 13:19:04 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @jonfavs The only sand running out of the hour glass is the time the NRA has left as a viable organization.  People are starting to see what it stands for and who it stands with and it is patently not the values that shaped this country.  The NRA should not longer be allowed to divide.
970649239645802500 2018-03-05 13:16:27 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN And I hope she continues to speak about the divide and encourage people from all corners to come together once again as they did 50 years ago to bring about change throughout the electorate.  We must have change and we must have it now.  The current experiment has failed.
970648466547531776 2018-03-05 13:13:22 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @AdeMontignie @krassenstein Please keep doing what you are doing.  I have no idea of how many followers you have but I do hope they double if not triple as you speak truth!!  Do not stop.
970429054204760064 2018-03-04 22:41:30 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Amy_Siskind @morgfair @waltshaub Totally agree but no one is raising the flag and so the normalizing continues.
970324142443696128 2018-03-04 15:44:37 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BettyBowers Just think about those that elected him!!
970296829303820289 2018-03-04 13:56:06 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @morgfair @debraanddave Totally agree with everything said.  We must change the narrative in Nov or they will feel they have no resistance to anything they (Republicans) do.
970296292000878594 2018-03-04 13:53:57 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @morgfair @NPRinskeep And congressional reaction will be nonexistent.  Their silence will be deafening.
970267448585924611 2018-03-04 11:59:21 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @AdeMontignie @krassenstein Not as long as congressional leadership is what it is. We must turn the tables and get rid of those that dont or no longer care we are turning into a swamp of unethical behavior.
969939693663027200 2018-03-03 14:16:58 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate Actually it is time for the press to do its job and expose this administration for what it is but like the politicians the media covers it is too afraid they will lose access and ratings.  Not saying all but it does appear the CNNs and Foxs do.
969728369662267392 2018-03-02 00:17:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Really.  Then as the COS do something about it.  Seems easy enough.
969727889242456064 2018-03-02 00:15:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNBC @doriaroberts Thank you for the additional information.  I hope those in the state that do not believe this is how the state should be run ensure those that promoted this are not allowed to remain in office.  Probably an uphill fight, but a worthy fight nonetheless.
969641418473066496 2018-03-02 18:31:43 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN @cjvela2014 Maybe 5th approaching 6th.  Thanks for asking.
969621705806229504 2018-03-02 17:13:24 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNBC While I continue to shocked by this, why hasnt or what has the GA governor said about this?  Can the legislature just pass a law without it being signed?  Did the legislature just stage a coup?  Just asking?  CNBC, what have you asked?
969620836494774273 2018-03-02 17:09:56 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN As I have said before, it takes one to know one and I would suggest he is one.
969536517839491072 2018-03-02 11:34:53 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN And people should say to the Senator, takes one to know one
969356420960399360 2018-03-01 23:39:15 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics Not surprised as his coffers are probably filled to the rim with NRA money so why should he bother.
969356172640825344 2018-03-01 23:38:15 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Then I hope the state gets what it deserves, a giant loss of revenue and people as Delta moves its HQ. It is shameful for a state legislature to take such a stand and I certainly hope the governor vetoes the bill.
968996101834661888 2018-02-28 23:47:28 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GrahamDavidA @TheAtlantic But shows the WH is a toxic place to work.  When will the correct person be removed from the residence???
968995670630813696 2018-02-28 23:45:45 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @nowthisnews And this is news because???  I believe the last few days has demonstrated the fear politicans have of the NRA because they do not want to lose the money.  71 FL legislators voted concern over porn instead of adjusting the Semi Auto weapons policy for the state. So what is the ..
968994989840715776 2018-02-28 23:43:03 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN If Delta departs, Coke should follow suit.
968994901462536192 2018-02-28 23:42:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Shallow minded and mean spirited.  Delta should move its headquarters, take the 1000s of employees and move to a state where rationale minds reside and leave the petty, money hungry state legislators to rot.  It is absolutely the dumbest thing the state could do.
967901504836374528 2018-02-25 23:17:56 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BettyBowers Wow, Mrs. Bowers you are so correct. It is such a shame we are where we are today. But change is in sight and we must ensure change happens!!
966828037613522944 2018-02-22 00:12:21 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes They will go lower to protect their interest.  We must stay the high ground to show them we can beat them just as the citizens of this nation have beat every attempt at tyranny and injustice. Elected officials must know they are not safe from ouster and they must know it now.
966827087880491008 2018-02-22 00:08:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @FNBOmaha @ChrisGorham @krassenstein A great first step.  Need many more!!
966824515044106241 2018-02-22 23:58:21 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @OliviaResists @B52Malmet @zflowrpowr @chelseahandler @tedlieu @teresa_atHome @mindyanns @chillibeanboy @Alyssa_Milano @StormResist @NRA @AdeMontignie @tizzywoman Then there needs to be 1000 other letters that state if you do toe the line you will not remain an elected official at the loca, state or federal level.  In others words, work for all of your constituents not just a few.  We need to take our country back and we need to do it now!
966823933839380480 2018-02-22 23:56:03 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BillKristol Here Here Sir.  I will drink with you!!
966717755977236481 2018-02-22 16:54:08 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN He has long ago outlived any shred of decency he might have once had.  Absolute power over an organization can do that to you.
966717549244305409 2018-02-22 16:53:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Dont stand with dictators but certain stand with the NRA as they give you money and suggest you do nothing to aid the senseless deaths that come from a lack of cooperation on gun licensing and checks. So at this moment, who is worse???
966717167453573120 2018-02-22 16:51:48 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Who exact and where exactly is the legacy news organizations mentioned.  Must not be Fox News or the WSJ. And who in this country wants to see any mother crying over the loss of a child by murder.These people can have their platform but she like others do not deserve it.
966693402673930240 2018-02-22 15:17:22 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC It will never be lets work together to find a solution to denying guns to people who should not have them. And using GOD is just wrong and misses the point.
966691502897401857 2018-02-22 15:09:49 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SethAbramson This lady should be unseated immediately.
966691367240990721 2018-02-22 15:09:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SethAbramson I am quite sure she now regrets saying stating she was misquoted, but it does illustrate where we are in the political world were Republicans are going to continue to take NRA and blame everything gun related on everyone else. We are more divided now then anytime I can remember
966300370166263808 2018-02-21 13:15:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics We have lost all shred of decency at all levels of government just to continue to get money from groups that do not care if the country is sliding away from democracy as long as they get their way and it is obvious state and local politicians will let them.
966004518524739584 2018-02-20 17:39:59 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN So where are you CNN and when you finally take a stand for country and not the tax cut you get to take advantage of? The world is waiting.
966004328174702600 2018-02-20 17:39:13 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN So quick to impeach Clinton, so slow to impeach now.  It says many things about the people in leadership positions in Congress. No integrity, no moral compass, no passion for Americans who do not vote their way and no belief in the constitution.  It is tough to be an American now
966003916998627328 2018-02-20 17:37:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN At what point will congress stop allowing this to take place and start impeachment proceedings.  It is unfortunate the one thing we need is a constitutional way to remove this unqualified and undignified person from office without congress in the middle.
965242399415992321 2018-02-18 15:11:36 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNBC I wonder why?  Perhaps is empires patriarch would not like it and the propped up empire would collapse as it should have decades ago.  I wonder what would happen if the media actually followed the money?  Could eliminate all doubt regarding Russia.  Just saying.
965014918251581440 2018-02-17 00:07:40 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN No Laura Ingram did the wrong thing at the wrong time and step into a place she has no business.  This nation is founded on the rule of law, not the rule of Fox News and to dignify this as a feud is lowering CNNs standard of journalism.  Oh Wait, you have already reached bottom
964832953703522304 2018-02-17 12:04:36 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @nowthisnews True, but it has been pointed out LeBron is above anything she can say by his actions and deeds.  It is Fox News that needs to be silenced since they are doing as much to divide the nation as this administration is doing. Fox News is no value add to the conversation.
964832467822800896 2018-02-17 12:02:40 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN What does it say about a country that has spent its life promoting unity when the VP of that country does not take the first step.  Rule of law decline, democracy decline, and a nation on the decline is what is have now and it is a shame to watch.  We are no longer a world leader
964470539107684352 2018-02-16 12:04:30 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC And the unfortunate thing is you, the media will allow him to show patience even after the next shooting and the next and the next.  You are truly failing at your job of informing America how bad the leadership of this country has become.
964469742118625280 2018-02-16 12:01:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @jemelehill It Fox, it is bias from the start and should not even be considered a news show.  So at the end of the day, does what Fox News says matter?  And I think not.  They along with others have embrace the wrong that is the right!!
963602586170462209 2018-02-13 02:35:34 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @JaydenMichele Happy Ms. Jaymes.  Many happy returns on the day!!
963561373723779073 2018-02-13 23:51:48 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espn A
963557729636962304 2018-02-13 23:37:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN He might but America does not. How did he get to be a 4 star Marine anyway. Duty, Honor, Country seems to have passed him by.
963476718924320769 2018-02-13 18:15:24 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @StacyGSG It is why he will never be the green momba. Mombas dont get sick!!!  Get better soon Greeny!!
963413830146691073 2018-02-13 14:05:31 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @tribelaw The sad part is Congress will not grow a pair as long as the leadership stays as it is now.  Quite the opposite they will continue to engorge the rich while praying on the poor until they are no longer in office.  Which cannot come soon enough.
963410514087903232 2018-02-13 13:52:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC He should draw more than fire and the media should be leading the charge!!
962658170719145985 2018-02-11 12:02:47 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @realDonaldTrump @ananavarro No, he doesnt get it and never will until he is outside looking in.  We must work to make that happen sooner rather than later.
962657935464849408 2018-02-11 12:01:51 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Let her run and she can be defeated like many this coming Nov.  It is time to return this nation to the democratic principles that made it great and are now being destroyed by the current administration.
961980421734109186 2018-02-09 15:09:39 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espn D
961012037026570240 2018-02-06 23:01:39 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Why is this guy even being interviewed???  I do not understand.  He is not in the know, was only on the stage for a hot minute.  CNN cant you find another more credible talking head?????
960975042250203136 2018-02-06 20:34:38 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Clearly there are jokes and then there are jokes.  You do not joke about treason and so once again things are covered up and allowed to pass.  The slippery slope just keeps getting more slippery.  Thanks CNN for nothing.
960672031112159232 2018-02-05 00:30:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN We have arrived. 1933 is here and we will do nothing about it until it is far too late. National Vetting Office. International is just the beginning.
960359692735262720 2018-02-04 03:49:28 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Again I asks why?  Does he want war?  If this is true there is no defense of it in any way.  The world needs to relax tensions not increase them
960280667681640448 2018-02-04 22:35:26 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate A tweet the Speaker should not have made in the first place, just like the tax bill and any attack on Medicare.
960279991736000513 2018-02-04 22:32:45 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Why?
960279420027265025 2018-02-04 22:30:29 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @JimPethokoukis It is hard to believe there is a Republican congress isnt it. Where are we headed??
960279098055684099 2018-02-04 22:29:12 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BarackObama @Lady_Star_Gem Well done.  Please continue!!
960259499763339264 2018-02-04 21:11:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics Party over country is now the norm.  Democracy is the loser, as are the American people.
960216478648856576 2018-02-04 18:20:23 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ElizabethHurley It is extremely easy to understand why they are favorites as you wear it very well. I hope the outfit sells out!!
959568701413580803 2018-02-02 23:26:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @RobCohenMD @aeatz I apologize but in what way is there a massive lead and if there is will it be sustained through 2018?
959442085945495552 2018-02-02 15:03:13 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @DaveDoyle6 Agreed Mr. Doyle and I certainly appreciate the tone and tenor of the discussion.  GOD bless you as well and have a great day and weekend.
959431455276400642 2018-02-02 14:20:58 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @DaveDoyle6 But suffice to say I disagree with your rationale regarding diversity.  It has been hallmark of America since its founding but now it seems the movement by the majority is to return to a more segregated position which lacks inclusion. We will see what the nation really wants.
959430915863777280 2018-02-02 14:18:50 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @DaveDoyle6 Mr. Doyle I will only say if either side wins we will probably end up with civil unrest because this experiment in democracy demands free and open liberty for all not just a few.  As for diversity, it is a much longer discussion that will not fit twitter.
959419865512710144 2018-02-02 13:34:55 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @johnmaginnes Agree Mr. Maginnes, agree.
959419685677789184 2018-02-02 13:34:12 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @morningmika Hard to believe this is our government today. What a mess!!
959398515138015232 2018-02-02 12:10:05 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @DaveDoyle6 Every move made by this administration and congress has been to remove those safe guards which has defined us as a nation and if left unchecked will move us back to a nation that uses segregation and not integration.  So you see it your way and I see it mind.  Lets see who right
959398171695833090 2018-02-02 12:08:43 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @DaveDoyle6 Mr. Doyle you and I will agree to disagree as I believe you have twisted this.  I believe their is an attempt to move us to a totalitarian effort controlled by the republicans for a limited segment of America.  Since Jan 20 of last year we have been moving in this direction.
959207973750034433 2018-02-01 23:32:56 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @DaveDoyle6 One other thing.  Since we are all one race, human, we need to elevate the discussion and I am really dont care what liberals or conversations think or say as neither has a way that is good for the country.
959207599257341953 2018-02-01 23:31:27 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @DaveDoyle6 Mr. Doyle, My feelings started the day I raised my hand and took an oath to protect this country against all enemies foreign and domestic. And right now I believe the country needs to move away from the direction in which it is headed.
958867693507104768 2018-01-31 01:00:47 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC New Movement???? What kind of reporting is that.  Tell it like it is, this movement is to end democracy as we know and install an authoritarian government beholding to no citizen.  Exactly opposite to the principals this nation was founded on.  Movement...please, get real.
958760727816359936 2018-01-31 17:55:45 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espn D for DC!!
958741085412626433 2018-01-31 16:37:41 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @mortreport @dannykanell Now the question is who will the Redskins put around him. Pryor Sr has got to go along with Dotson, so who will be the wide receivers?  One step forward and ___ steps backwards?????
958738600585236483 2018-01-31 16:27:49 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Espngreeny Well he was going to go somewhere as I dont think he was ever going to stay in DC.  While his numbers were good inside the twenties, goal line and the always unexplainable interception late in games did him in here. So why not Cleveland
958509470383882240 2018-01-30 01:17:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @esquire Because they think they can get away for now. And the FBI is an agency they have never been able to control so now watch how the agency reacts to the leader.
958504151092252672 2018-01-30 00:56:12 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse There is not one shred of truth in that statement.
958503768529821696 2018-01-30 00:54:41 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BettyBowers Mrs. Bowers I am with you.  Wont hear anything truthful anyway.  Might as well read a great work of fiction instead of listening to one.
958503472827129858 2018-01-30 00:53:30 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @wingoz @espngolic @MatthewBerryTMR Cant we all get along?  Plus, no shoulder no worry!! 
958502962736893953 2018-01-30 00:51:29 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN There is a threshold.  How about truth, honesty, nothing to hide threshold.  If he is not guilty then talk to the man as it will hurt nothing.  Threshold, now there is a crock!!
958419522087776256 2018-01-30 19:19:55 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @DavidMuir @ABC United meaning one ethnicity, one thought, one justice and one class.  He is too divisive to mean what he stated.
958419178855256066 2018-01-30 19:18:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC What the Speaker is saying is for far too long the FBI has prosecuted Republicans and we need that to end and we are going to make sure going forward they leave Republicans alone so they can do what they want, while prosecuting all democrats.  Tyranny lives, democracy dies!!
958307385247977473 2018-01-30 11:54:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @JewellAngeline I hope you stay tuned as well.  I would just say I disagree but then we must call them as we see them and I see this differently then you do.  So yes, we will see.
958125430636195848 2018-01-29 23:51:18 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @RobCohenMD Well said and totally agree with must act with passion and respect for our country and with haste to take it back!!

958033528838598656 2018-01-29 17:46:07 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NBCNews @CNBC Another blow to democracy and freedom.  America is losing right now, but it is my hope that stronger wills will prevail and the nightmare that is this administration and most of congress will not see the light of day pass November.
957947744253104129 2018-01-29 12:05:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Truth hurts!  If the UN Ambassador does not like what happened then start moving America toward the middle and begin to unify not divide.  Have honor and integrity versus insults and threats. Treat others better even if you do not like them.  Be inclusive.
957795965368504320 2018-01-28 02:02:07 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC This man is not an example of America we want in congress or in law enforcement.  He should not and must not ever reach a ballot in any state for his views are not the views of the good people of this country.
957795229746253824 2018-01-28 01:59:12 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Then we need to fight even harder to ensure they do not win!!!
957737726115237888 2018-01-28 22:10:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @HomeDepot @BryanDawsonUSA Well said.  Most if not all billionaires have no idea what it is like to be a normal wage earner and even though they are not in the billions it seems congress has forgotten also. We must keep fighting the real stupids
957735605672337408 2018-01-28 22:02:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC It doesnt matter because he does not mean it!!
956945092467568640 2018-01-26 17:41:03 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse How much did you have to pay these people or do they work in the WH currently?  We all know the government is doing nearly as much for the American people as it once did.  Good luck getting people to believe these ads.
956881814186090496 2018-01-26 13:29:37 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Why is this guy even being allowed to be in the discussions? What expertise is he bringing to the table? What experience does he have?  It is just a sham and more mature (if there are any in the WH) should be driving this discussion as crucial as it is.

956308669913853955 2018-01-24 23:32:08 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @TheAtlantic 2018 could be as watershed and as nation changing as 1968 so please educate a nation that so needs it. Thank you as the timing is perfect.
956134545220362240 2018-01-24 12:00:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MalcolmNance Just look at who is doing the interview and on what station. You are correct, our laws, our justice system and our way of life are all under attack and Fox News is leading the way.

956133312828968961 2018-01-24 11:55:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @chrislhayes Again a case of party over country.  This is the same Senator who put a cease and desist order on all who are writting his office to tell him what a lousy job he is doing.  But until they are kicked out of office these totalitarian like statements will continue.
955860252653744129 2018-01-23 17:50:17 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNOpinion @CNN No I realize it but too much time is spent not defining how it is in worse shape and what can be done to change it.
955464490144935936 2018-01-22 15:37:40 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NancyPelosi In addition, Congress must address its constitutional responsibilities in a professional manner which seems to have eluded it for many years now.  Please figure out how to reach across the isle and move forward versus stand rigid and go nowhere.
955464102465417218 2018-01-22 15:36:08 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NancyPelosi Madame Pelosi, at this point and time in the history of our country show the American people both sides can compromise and reopen government.  Win the bigger battle later open government now!!

953773977511620608 2018-01-17 23:40:11 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN CNN, it is time you stopped interviewing and started reporting.  You must report this assault on democracy that is taking place.

953001320377737217 2018-01-15 20:29:55 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics It is too difficult to wrap my head about this. I guess the GOP wants anarchy and disarray so they can rob everyone that doesnt have 6 zeros in their bank account.  What does this say about who we have become as a country?? How is this possible? CNN do your job and explain!
952946067833872384 2018-01-15 16:50:22 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN @paulrevere313 Cant prove that by actions or deeds.  I believe we have plenty of both for this supposed billionaire, who has done nothing but enriched himself and turned the country into a laughing stock around the world
952878571390996480 2018-01-15 12:22:09 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Like everyone else around him they enable him to say things and then defend him.  Everything he has done says he is racist, shallow and doesnt care about anyone except himself.  Worse choice the country has made in the modern history.
952712874031570944 2018-01-14 01:23:44 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC7News HIs actions since taking office does not support his claim that he is not a racist.  Every thing he has done from the travel ban to the increased deportations illustrate his true colors.  His actions speak volumes and his words ring hollow.
951901779901538306 2018-01-12 19:40:44 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Party over country.  How could they not hear it.  How can they stand to say they did not hear it if they were in the room.  Were they at the far end of the table?  Did the man whisper?  Moral integrity no longer matters to these people only power.
951487040092295168 2018-01-11 16:12:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GolicAndWingo Shove it.  To reach the pinnacle of your sport where every athlete is a 1 percenters 10 times win 5 cannot be match.  Same coach, same quarterback.  Saban is a great coach and has done great things but the Patriots are the true dynasty
951172936538484737 2018-01-10 19:24:34 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ananavarro Lets all make sure his name cannot get on the ballot.  If it does lets make sure no one votes for him.  Make sure to given money to his opponent if he does make the ballot. This administration must be stopped and all who support it.
951107343445647360 2018-01-10 15:03:56 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics Better question.  Is democracy threatened under Trump?  That is what seems to be occurring.  A redacted executive branch with a very strong congressional branch and a weak judiciary branch.  So where do historians see the country at the end of the Tump presidency???
950700324125323264 2018-01-09 12:06:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell Did Alabama win???? You play to win....correct? I cant wait until next year when you have 8 months to develop your dislike. it should be at a truly remarkable level.

950393963457974273 2018-01-08 15:49:13 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell Once again too drastic. Only one game (Tenn v KC) poorly officiated, which made it bad. ATL v LAR experience ruled. BUFF v Jags okay it was terrible.  CAR v NO great. The NFL problem is replay. Need to make decisions quicker. Makes it hard to watch
949979985703514112 2018-01-07 12:24:13 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNOpinion @CNN Dont make any deal, but in the end it will not matter because even if they make the deal he will change it.
949034859716063232 2018-01-04 21:48:37 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @RWPUSA Then get the republican controlled congress to begin impeachment proceeding. Oh wait, they are using him as cover to destroy the American middle class, so I guess impeachment will have to wait.
949034215764582400 2018-01-04 21:46:03 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate The question is, is it legal for him to do and isnt there better way for the AG to use his office?  Not sure on the first part but quite sure on the second part of my question
948696729523716097 2018-01-03 23:25:00 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell Mr. Kanell, I know you do this for fun...sort of but come on, why hate on the SEC so much.  Plus UCF needs to have something for their season!!  What everyone seems to forget is GA kicked Auburns behind in the SEC Champ.  So Auburn is not pure here.

947609471454515202 2017-12-31 23:24:38 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @brianklaas The media has too many competing demands for rating, advertising and access to care about truth and clarity.  They have become a part of the problem and not the impartial window to what might be truth. The media now just opines.
947607994782638080 2017-12-31 23:18:46 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @AnitaMarks Thank you Ms. Marks, but you should not stop there.  Bruce Allen, Doug Williams, the coaching staff all should retire or just go away.  Just not a very good organization.

947293832126877696 2017-12-30 02:30:24 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SaysHummingbird They can only do it if allowed by us the American citizen. Step up, speak up and unseat all who would take support from those that need it. Lets go!
946929250824867840 2017-12-29 02:21:41 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate What I hope is they have their 2018 assessment with them or they are lined up for a bruising at the end of 2018 when the IRS actually reviews their taxes.  IRS has already stated people should be certain before prepaying. By Nov 2018 Blue could be the right color.

946552548248440832 2017-12-28 01:24:48 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Redskins Stop putting a positive spin on something far from positive. 6 mins from a Saints win and total collapses against Chargers and Cowboys. Lets strive to win every game. Lets not strive to be mediocre

946133962509996032 2017-12-27 21:41:29 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Does the congressmen actually understand the role of the FBI and DOJ in our country.  They do and should not serve the President, they serve the constitution and the country. The purge that is really needed is congress, first, foremost and it needs to happen now!!

943937441077047298 2017-12-21 20:13:18 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC So somewhere in the strategy apparatus in the WH they believe we can go it alone in the world.  That we can retain allies, foster good will and have an effective foreign policy with threats.  Not a good precedent to set.  The UN is on US soil for a reason.  They should get that!!
943861654281957376 2017-12-21 15:12:09 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNBC Not unfair, just a spotlight to show what a two face looks like and how he is not for citizens but self and party.
943649461754126337 2017-12-20 01:08:58 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNBC Dont count on it.  Nice press today but those bonuses still have to be paid for and oh lets look behind why they decided to announce these publicly.

943596926699757570 2017-12-20 21:40:13 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics One of many broken promises for those who voted for the bill, however it will not compare to the broken country the bill will leave in its wake.

943550380251734016 2017-12-20 18:35:15 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics What a rude awakening Senator Flake has coming. Along with all of the others who where promised something that might never materialize.  Oh well, it is where we are in the nation at the moment.
943541661115867138 2017-12-20 18:00:36 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Just goes to show he is not a President for all citizens, just those that can afford health care, have wealth and those that dont care about anything but money.
943288714897313793 2017-12-19 01:15:29 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @USCBO @SenatorDurbin Senator, there is really no more to be said. They have passed the bill.  American democracy took a big hit but now they have to live with the consequences.  Lets see if their constituents let them get away with it.
943267115745841152 2017-12-19 23:49:40 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics Come on people.  Why do you think this bill is designed the way it is.  My gosh the lies and the fact he has gotten away with it.  CNN you should turn in your credentials.
943261476273442816 2017-12-19 23:27:15 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @repjohnlewis Well said as always.  America has died a lot today with the passage of this bill and now we must work to get those that voted for it out of office as soon as possible!!
943243340933468161 2017-12-19 22:15:11 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics Yes you are because you are going to get voted out once folks learn what this tax bill really does and who it is really for!!
943194537979150336 2017-12-19 19:01:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC The very thought an elected political leader does not care Americans do not like a bill but will pass it anyway is a clear sign of party over country.  We will pay dearly for this bill.
943111563401101312 2017-12-19 13:31:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics The shame of it is no matter how many Americans dislike the bill and no matter how much they protest, the Party will pass the bill and the country will be left in its wake. Party over country is alive and well.
942919099767775232 2017-12-18 00:46:46 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics Really, so believable Senator.  Anything for party over country!!
942537012762021893 2017-12-17 23:28:29 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SenJohnMcCain @goldengateblond @Alyssa_Milano They should postpone the vote but they wont because they wont seat Jones so they still have a majority given Rubio and Coker are still a yes.  Collins is probably a yes so they might be able to get it passed 50-48 with McCain an abstention. But this is a guess
942511678490628096 2017-12-17 21:47:49 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse Dont have to read it as I know it is not good low and middle class Americans.  Hard to believe we would ever reach this day of Party and Greed over Americans.
942507569821732864 2017-12-17 21:31:30 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate Yes it happens last Nov and the tax plan passing will complete the process.  Party over country.
942466808971489280 2017-12-17 18:49:32 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNBC Why wouldnt he defend.  It enriches most of those serving in congress and deals a death blow to those that gained medical coverage under the ACA. The lies continue to mount but Nov 2018 is coming.
942462796385669121 2017-12-17 18:33:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @JohnCornyn @ABC I am also confident my tax bill will go up 20% once it does.  Not fair and certainly party over country.  The bill is a complete lie to the low and middle income families.
942033402089365505 2017-12-16 14:07:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC I believe everyone has captured the sentiment so I will just agree.  There is no place in this country for party first so let this investigation go to it natural conclusion and if nothing is found then so be it.  But as we all know cockroaches fear the light, so lets see.
941748265921531904 2017-12-15 19:14:18 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SenatorLeahy Very sad Senator Leahy but the Republicans will vote him in anyway.  This is what we have come to. Heavy handed politics that is ruining the country. Have them seat Doug Jones and get Senators McCain, Flake, Croker and Collins to vote no on the tax bill. Please
941747443384889345 2017-12-15 19:11:01 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GolfChannel Wow, that is such a surprise.  You didnt make him the #1 newsmakers.  How did you screw that up.  Well I guess I will move on from golf now or at least watching your channel.

941473894107701248 2017-12-14 01:04:02 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @morgfair @laurenduca Sorry, but how does the Senator know?  We really need term limits all the way around.
941449839002431489 2017-12-14 23:28:27 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes Putin is an expert on spying and he is helping the agenda so he should know!!
941449359828406273 2017-12-14 23:26:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate Stumble, bumble, bungling, they all fit but at the end of the day. It isnt their fault, no matter what they say or do.  We are in a heap of trouble.

941363441402511363 2017-12-14 17:45:08 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNBC @GhoulieBits Completely agree with you on all counts.  Thank you for expressing it much better than I could.
941361319575523328 2017-12-14 17:36:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNBC If even one is smart they will not listen to a pitch. they will read everything they can get their hands on regarding the bill and then call their congress person and senator and tell them what to do. Citizens must take this on and do it now.
941354967029440513 2017-12-14 17:11:28 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GolicAndWingo Wait, you have to have a favorite on air talent??????
941040048543272960 2017-12-13 20:20:05 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse No way possible.  The government cannot move that fast unless the charts are already in place.  This bill is bad and getting worse by the day.
940926840633462784 2017-12-13 12:50:15 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Yes and Roy Moore was his own worse enemy.  Deserve to lose.

940372339321196546 2017-12-11 00:06:51 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @AdeMontignie @Amy_Siskind The very sad part of this is the RNC does not care, the women of Alabama seem not to care, of course DJT does not care and congress does not care. I agree a great stain, so we must remember and vote accordingly in Nov of 2018.
940338471125901313 2017-12-11 21:52:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC The fascinating thing is the Republican Party has been staunchly against immigration reform forever.  So whose failed policy is it????
940224062751682561 2017-12-11 14:17:39 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GolfChannel I have always wondered how in the heck did they get a number to call in???  Good move on all fronts!!
939998631972757504 2017-12-10 23:21:52 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @realDonaldTrump @AdeMontignie @Micah0118 Lets not forget the congress is using this as a cover to enact the greatest shift in wealth ever seen.  The fight must include stopping the tax act, and must work to get votes for the correct candidate in Alabama.  The resistance must attack on all fronts.
939992795523239937 2017-12-10 22:58:41 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @AdeMontignie @RedTRaccoon I am with you 100%
939825683093745665 2017-12-10 11:54:38 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC We are isolating ourselves from the rest of the world and the administration doesnt care nor sees what the harmful ramifications can be.  It is a sad state of affairs right now. (Pun intended)
939616894549741568 2017-12-09 22:04:59 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNPolitics The Supreme Court is now part of the problem. So all pillars of government are working against the constitution and what America has stood for. Such a shame.

But lets turn our attention to congress who is using Trump to forward an agenda detrimental to all Americans regardless of party.  We have to turn the conversation to country first and not party first. We need that especially for Tuesday in Alabama

939216868648407043 2017-12-08 19:35:25 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @rachelaziani Rachel thanks as always for great words to live by. I hope the fires stay away from where you are. Stay safe.
939215786484420608 2017-12-08 19:31:07 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @NeuroCandies @willowbhoward @1UZ_FE_32 This is and has been an excellent exchange.  I guess the question remains.  Is the tax reform act good for the middle to low income Americans and should that matter to the greater society as a whole? From what I am reading I think not but will continue to examine.
938757362327998465 2017-12-07 13:09:31 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @willowbhoward @NeuroCandies @1UZ_FE_32 Interesting.  Not sure the context of your latest comments so if you could take a moment and explain further that would be great as I would to ensure my comments address your points.  Thanks
938485248580517888 2017-12-06 19:08:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @NeuroCandies @willowbhoward @1UZ_FE_32 Totally agree regarding corporations but how do you separate the two issues in this environment?  I think if the tax reform would not be an issue had they stuck to corporate tax redesign but that is wishful thinking on my part.
938242316749496320 2017-12-05 03:02:54 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @JeffFlake Perhaps you can campaign for him since his own party seems to be unwilling to. He must win!!
938241499321552896 2017-12-05 02:59:39 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @willowbhoward @1UZ_FE_32 @NeuroCandies My issue is I do not know if there will be a trickle or not. The right jobs are still leaving the country and there does not seem to be new revenue sources coming in.  So at the end of the day. The rich win and the poor lose. Same story different decade. Must be stopped.
938148300393500672 2017-12-05 20:49:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Just out of morbid curiosity has any leading democrat politicked for Jones in Alabama or is he going it alone?  Seems to me it is telling that he is out on a limb during this time. One party instead of two???
938075291125129216 2017-12-05 15:59:12 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SpeakerRyan @ABCPolitics It is not status quo, it is not to shift American wealth to American who clearly do not need it and to remove safeguards from Americans that are trying to make their way in todays service economy.  No way to justify what either bill does to the medium income taxpayer.
938029869665079297 2017-12-05 12:58:43 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espngolic @MGolicJR57 @NDmom So was this the sandwich you couldnt wait to get to??????https://twitter.com/inbetweenbuns/status/938026193047060481
937833136435671041 2017-12-04 23:56:58 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @NeuroCandies @willowbhoward @1UZ_FE_32 Seems to me and I am no expert the condition we want is one that stimulates job growth and to do that we need to reinvigorate the manufacturing sector for growth in the middle class.  Not sure what side economics that is but a service economy is not going to help us long term.
937832305615351808 2017-12-04 23:53:40 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Too late.  The GOP has already given up any vestige of honor and integrity.  Next stop tyranny.
937831645230583810 2017-12-04 23:51:02 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NDmom That is the horror and terrible nature of this whole episode.  There was no reason to do it other than ruin the streak
937746048478572544 2017-12-04 18:10:55 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> What happens next for the GOP tax plan @CNNPolitics http://cnn.it/2BHdBo1 I know it is CNN but not a bad synopsis
937722991538049025 2017-12-04 16:39:17 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @NeuroCandies @willowbhoward @1UZ_FE_32 Part 2: Need it
937722911971999750 2017-12-04 16:38:58 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @NeuroCandies @willowbhoward @1UZ_FE_32 All good and valid points.  I agree we certainly need critical thinking and action going forward.  I do not believe we can sit by any longer and just accept or hand off to a PAC or any other lobbying agent.  Time for each citizen to act on their own.  Might not like it but we ...
937646497662930944 2017-12-04 11:35:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @NeuroCandies @willowbhoward @1UZ_FE_32 Your statement is very true. But isnt that the hard part?  Finding facts when in most cases the media and others are offering opinions?  I am even sure those that voted for the bill have an idea of its ramifications over the long term.
937505838834552834 2017-12-03 02:16:24 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT Senator, help me understand what 100,000 signatures would do when millions are affected.  Where is the next forum where you and those that oppose the bill will speak and let hear your thoughts?
937505114381840384 2017-12-03 02:13:31 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @morgfair @nytpolitics Only if the conservatives remain the majority and it is becoming increasingly clear they should not be for the sake of the country.
937504604295704576 2017-12-03 02:11:30 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NeuroCandies I do not mind at all and I will follow you back here in a moment.  To be honest I used to think there were rational people in Congress.  Now all I can think about is term limits. :-). Enjoy your evening.
937503154517823494 2017-12-03 02:05:44 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @mort4216 @NeuroCandies Thank you.  Next step do as you are doing and learn everything I can and start enlisting the support of others to do the same. But as you say this must be done with facts, so those need to be collected first because the easiest way to be defeated is not know the facts.
937500849579884544 2017-12-03 01:56:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @mort4216 @NeuroCandies Because as far as I can tell the left is not sounding the alarm bells, which is troubling, and the right doesnt care.  So to defeat this bill it will take a grass roots effort across the country.
937500329402339328 2017-12-03 01:54:31 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @mort4216 @NeuroCandies You have made excellent points all day.  I think the next steps are to get more people who want to know the truth about this legislation together and start to pressure all levels of government to not let it get out of committee.
937499909082746881 2017-12-03 01:52:50 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNOpinion @CNN I dont think people want them to go to jail. I just think people want them to go.
937466294378598400 2017-12-03 23:39:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @mort4216 @NeuroCandies Well said and great context.  Thank you
937465398030753793 2017-12-03 23:35:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @NeuroCandies @mort4216 Probably, but isnt the Republican Party the party of fiscal responsibility? A 1.5 Trillion addition plus tax cuts just doesnt add up.  Oh and they cant pay for the cuts.  So let the debate continue and we will see what happens.
937411443661656069 2017-12-03 20:01:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @AdeMontignie @SenSanders So as I understand it this is not done yet. All of us must come together and let it be clear if this bill actually passes everyone who votes yes for it will not be reelected.
937352107879010306 2017-12-03 16:05:32 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @rwchicago Thank you.  All I have to say is wow.
937322908493471744 2017-12-03 14:09:30 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell Mr. Kanell, not non-sense.  You cant let Bama in as you have said all season now that OSU has won over Wisconsin.  Let OSU in and play Clemson
937322443575873537 2017-12-03 14:07:39 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espngolic Mr. Golic, I agree lot of great debate and in the end strength of schedule will win out and OSU will jump to 4. Not what I would like to see but what I think will be.
937141840364605440 2017-12-02 02:10:00 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @morgfair @justinhendrix Neither should the American people at election time but the attention span is so short they will forget.  This is a travesty on so many levels.
937129048488206337 2017-12-02 01:19:10 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @NeuroCandies Agree. Once they clean up the chicken scratches I hope to get a copy. But I think we also have to read the house version as well in order to have a complete picture.
937128367236833280 2017-12-02 01:16:28 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @CrankyMcWonker No question and I plan to but many of the tweets are asking to sign petitions and my point is not to sign until one, I understand the bill and two, not to blindly go where there is nothing once you get there.  All in all just adding to the deficit makes this a bad idea.
937115281754873856 2017-12-02 00:24:28 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BonnieBernstein Yes, you should be.  Well done. I await your next gem.
937113522164633602 2017-12-02 00:17:29 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BonnieBernstein Okay that was so bad it was good. 
937109694883205120 2017-12-02 00:02:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @NeuroCandies Thank you for looking.  I will do that. And I think it is 1.5 Trillion over the life of the bill, but it is the riders and other pork I have heard about that has me truly concerned and in disbelief.
937083337080016897 2017-12-02 22:17:32 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT @LarryMcVA Thanks hadnt thought of that.  BTW do you think they know?
937083041884917760 2017-12-02 22:16:22 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisGorham @CoryBooker Senator Booker, where and when is your speech to discuss the legislation and how it  can be defeated.  I would like to attend.
937082622509047808 2017-12-02 22:14:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @KamalaHarris Once you explain what the democrats are going to do to defeat the bill in committee I will sign but I have yet to hear one piece of strategy to be used so all of this is a ploy to get donations and that is a shame.
937080360743120896 2017-12-02 22:05:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT I know it is a bad bill.  I know it is the greatest shift of wealth away from those that cannot support themselves but tell/show us what the bill says.  We need to understand it before we kill it.  Help us understand it, just dont say it is wrong.
937012554873868288 2017-12-02 17:36:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @RVAwonk It is now time for true resistance.  All of us must call our congressmen and senators to voice opposition.  We must get local leaders to do the same. Governors must come out against it and the national political elite must know they will not get reelected if the bill goes final.
936803001003425792 2017-12-01 03:43:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain You will fail America tonight by voting yes and put democracy on a slippery slope. I hope you get what you want because your constituents will most certainly lose what they have. Party before country is not the oath you took!
936801239790006272 2017-12-01 03:36:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Democracy as we know is ending in America. The nation will never be the same if this bill becomes law. A 2nd revolution is on the horizon as tyranny cannot stand for long. #GOPTaxScam
936799760387674112 2017-12-01 03:30:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain How can you vote yes to ramrod a bill through the Senate that you know will hurt the majority of your own constituents? How? Is the America you want? Terrible
936795667782971393 2017-12-01 03:14:26 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @PattyMurray Pray you succeed.
936795536572628992 2017-12-01 03:13:55 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @PattyMurray For the sake of the nation I pry you succeed.
936763130725699584 2017-12-01 01:05:09 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake how can you vote yes on a bill that has had no public debate. This is party over country, this is not American democracy
936740099877949441 2017-12-01 23:33:38 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @greenfield64 Yes 1933 is in full effect.  Never thought I would see it in this country but there you go.
936730434641321984 2017-12-01 22:55:13 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SaysHummingbird The unfortunate thing is Congress is now as much of the problem as the Executive branch is.  They could never do it and they know we know they could never do it but will still do nothing.
936707610773946368 2017-12-01 21:24:32 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @KamalaHarris Senator, stop trying to stop a train that is moving too fast.  Lets ensure it never comes out of committee. Resistance!!
936694723099742210 2017-12-01 20:33:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NBCNightlyNews In what reality does he live I wonder???
936668748139909120 2017-12-01 18:50:06 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CecilHurt @dannykanell Deck chairs on the Titanic
936662570882207744 2017-12-01 18:25:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NancyPelosi The question is are you disgusted enough to go on TV and show America why this is a bad bill once it goes to committee???
936647806911176705 2017-12-01 17:26:53 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @rachelaziani Rachel, thank you for sharing the fact you are just too cool for words. . Happy December to you.
936615021295128576 2017-12-01 15:16:37 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BobLeyESPN Thank you
936393899756670976 2017-11-30 00:37:57 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Espngreeny Yes or YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
936042706840817664 2017-11-29 01:22:26 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @therealJuliaAnn Who would dare cancel on you.  Have no suggestions but find it rude.  However, if all else fails go Nobu!!
935962179588804608 2017-11-29 20:02:27 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @byLorenaBlas @thehill The demise of America has begun and the experiment is just about finished.  The professional political class has taken of the people, by the people and for the people and forever changed it. We are about to see the greatest shift of wealth ever and no one cares.
935862154229673984 2017-11-29 13:24:59 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell Danny, depending on the labor laws in a given state, there does not need to be due process for a business to fire someone.  They just need to decide it is what they want to do.
935837130479276032 2017-11-29 11:45:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN This just seals the deal for why those in AL should look at this election very close before casting their vote.
935821296876834816 2017-11-29 10:42:38 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @KendraLust Looks like a great start. Cant wait to see the finished product!
935698173758246913 2017-11-28 02:33:23 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN I wonder if they have actually read the bill?  the CBO basically states what the Senator is saying is not true.
935684948572418049 2017-11-28 01:40:50 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MariaCantwell @SenSanders @SenatorTimScott @tedcruz @DanaBashCNN @jaketapper @CNN If this is still America and a federated democracy of the people, by the people and for the people the Senate will not pass the bill, but if we are as divided as we appear it is a fore gone conclusion and the less affluent will suffer.
934922197335990272 2017-11-26 23:09:56 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espngolic This is the prime example of why you have to follow the Golics. They are Americas family of last Tweet!!
934857506882490368 2017-11-26 18:52:53 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC How can they with a straight face do this?  This tax bill must be stopped.
934816166421454848 2017-11-26 16:08:36 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Espngreeny I think the NFLs issue is over saturation.  They need to make Thursday special again versus weekly and retake Sunday.  Also, forget London and Mexico.
934815703101771776 2017-11-26 16:06:46 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Espngreeny Not at this point.  They needed to shine against Auburn and they did not.  Actually played a poor game with more mistakes than I have ever seen.  Wait until next year!!
934771810352222209 2017-11-26 13:12:21 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell Cant argue except to say Miami could be 8 at the moment.  Actually I am surprised you did not put 6 UGa, 7 OSU and 8 Miami given how you dislike Bama.
934587383500169216 2017-11-25 00:59:30 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GolfDigest @rickyleepotts @Bradford__Lee Just cant say that I do and I think time is on my side, along with his back, knees and Achilles.  I guess time will tell who is right.
934573300101144576 2017-11-25 00:03:32 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GolfDigest I now hope he doesnt get close. Stays healthy but plays bad golf
934572108537106440 2017-11-25 23:58:48 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espngolic I think there will be 2, the question who besides Auburn as I think they will beat GA again
934562616831283201 2017-11-25 23:21:05 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @morgfair @Khanoisseur Slowly and brick by brick the safeties are being taken off the government.  Our constitution is under attack and congress is just as big and the executive branch is. We must do something.
934510084201373702 2017-11-25 19:52:21 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @TrippIsenhourGC @GolfChannel Was, not anymore!!
934509382947160064 2017-11-25 19:49:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @rachelaziani You are more than welcome, you warm weather prophet!! 
934497786929827840 2017-11-25 19:03:29 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @JenniferAnWorld Really, not now, not ever and dont even think about coming back!
934472415949803520 2017-11-25 17:22:40 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @rachelaziani As always thank you for providing wisdom and an awesome way to start a day.  Best to you!!
934210618021818369 2017-11-24 00:02:22 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse Not a snowballs chance.
934196280531832832 2017-11-24 23:05:24 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Laci_Kay_Somers Who would actually tell you that???
934162636832374784 2017-11-24 20:51:43 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @BDO_USA @Redskins Yeah, so glad they got the win.  I think that was more important!!
934162443097595904 2017-11-24 20:50:56 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Espngreeny Next week will show what kind of pride, guts and will the U has.  Their backs are against the wall so lets see how they respond.
934161980809728002 2017-11-24 20:49:06 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell So DK, you went 44 and 0 in your years at FSU right???
933740574817087488 2017-11-23 16:54:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Happy Thanksgiving to all and may your day be filled with joy, laughter and love...oh yeah and lots of great food!!
933733239528869888 2017-11-23 16:25:26 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @rachelaziani Regardless, you will be warmer than the east coast so even though you moved the torment continues.  Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family!!
933711087945515009 2017-11-23 14:57:25 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @KendraLust Happy Thanksgiving to you as well and thank you for all you share!!
933701738883964929 2017-11-23 14:20:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CoolWhip @NDmom The Golic family is a national treasure.  May you live long and tweet!!
933701316890824706 2017-11-23 14:18:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GolfDigest We will just have to wait and see but you shouldnt really keep retweeting this.  What is the point?
933499505609191424 2017-11-22 00:56:40 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @therealJuliaAnn Well I will certain enjoy the tasty treats now!!  Happy Thanksgiving to you.  Not that any calorie ever stuck!!
933452296901578753 2017-11-22 21:49:04 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell Where is the none of the above vote?
933360240870985728 2017-11-22 15:43:17 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @jemelehill Congratulations.  You are very good at what you do and are excellent at dealing with the haters.  I wish you continued success!!
933358914372096000 2017-11-22 15:38:00 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell DK, this is one time where I am in total agreement with you.  But no matter how many teams they expand the playoffs to, there will still be injustice. So we might as well live with it.
932986527457660928 2017-11-21 14:58:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Deauxma Good morning and a Happy Thanksgiving week to you.  You enjoy the day as well.
932791011692220416 2017-11-20 02:01:22 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Alyssa_Milano The Statue of Liberty is weeping for sure. Very sad state of affairs.
932786464798265344 2017-11-20 01:43:18 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC @roz__ke Whose ancestors originated from somewhere, formed this nation and then invited those who wanted freedom to come.  So as I said we are a nation of immigrants.  Always have been and always will be.  Enjoy your evening.
932784034350067712 2017-11-20 01:33:38 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @nbcwashington Counts the times the team has started over and you come up with a resounding yes the team is better if they stay.  Put the other pieces in place and let me keep at it!!
932783153323937793 2017-11-20 01:30:08 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Could we be any more cruel and heartless.  What is gained by this?  However, since Mar a largo needs help that is okay but others have to go.  When will everyone get it that we are a nation of immigrants.  Always have been, always will be.
932731689461264386 2017-11-20 22:05:38 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Why spend tax payers money to do this?
932731355150110721 2017-11-20 22:04:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN There goes the economy!!  Such a shame
932650957783076869 2017-11-20 16:44:50 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @rachelaziani Say what!!!!  A true left coaster now.  Enjoy the ocean and all that California has to offer.  I hope you have a view of the ocean.
932636207875584001 2017-11-20 15:46:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @rachelaziani Happy Birthday to you!!!  Yes, have all kinds of fun in the sun of AZ.
932332081677512704 2017-11-19 19:37:44 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN @Yasminmurai @B_Rad_lee55 Mr. Belmore, I agree with you completely. The unfortunately thing to me is people who watch Fox take it as news.  Cant stop that as you say just have to understand it.  Peace to you and happy Thanksgiving.
932306952117465088 2017-11-19 17:57:53 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @therealJuliaAnn Good morning to you as well!!  Have a great one!!
932294583031160832 2017-11-19 17:08:44 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN @KarpisMaksudian Thanks.  Happy Sunday to you!!  So CNN the marker has been placed.  You up to it?????
932293599563321345 2017-11-19 17:04:49 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN @KarpisMaksudian Wont argue with you there, but if we are to ever return to a solid journalistic standard someone has to start. I dont care who, just someone!!
932292286616166404 2017-11-19 16:59:36 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN @KarpisMaksudian People who choose not to watch the other garbage.
932263526185529345 2017-11-19 15:05:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN I hope CNN is going to air a program which details this tax bill so all Americans can hear the whole thing, the good, the bad and the ugly versus snippets.  We need the entire plan laid out for all to see.  CNN take the lead and return to what TV news is supposed to be!!
932258774370476034 2017-11-19 14:46:26 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN The very base that elected those in power now and the biggest losers under this bill.  We must all rise up to defeat this shift of wealth to those that do not need it.  There has to be a better way.  Lets make Congress find it.
932244769576759296 2017-11-19 13:50:47 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell Your distain for BAMA knows no bounds.  Just remarkable.  Also, Clemson should be 4th but at this point all roads point to next Saturday and the Iron Bowl and then the ACC Championship. So keep your blind eye for now.
932037171476881408 2017-11-18 00:05:52 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @PattyMurray Since we know he does not care about working families why not.  With this administration we have finally reached Roman Empire status and our society will soon burn because of it.
931620673243541504 2017-11-17 20:30:51 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NBCNightlyNews So there you have it.  Party before anything else is what we have come to in this case.  Not justice, not what is right but party first.  Sounds a lot like a totalitarian position, not a democratic one. I guess the same can be said for the tax plan only the wealthy gain there.
931536876233781249 2017-11-17 14:57:53 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Espngreeny @espngolic @MikeAndMike Thank you for the memories. Great show, great people and great talent. #mmsaysthanks
931145827090911233 2017-11-16 13:03:59 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN I cannot believe this.  That is all I can say.  We are definitely going in th wrong direction.
930990206840426498 2017-11-15 02:45:36 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate No where to be found because they benefit from it just as the other 1%ers do, or didnt you know that?
930135237719416832 2017-11-13 18:08:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Redskins The problem is no running game, no underneath passing and a hurt defense.  You can highlight individual plays but what is this team going to do to get better for the rest of the season.  It is not lost yet, but could be if there is not a solid game plan for Sunday.
930133324030496769 2017-11-13 18:00:40 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espngolic This might finally teach you!! What am I saying. There will be more and I cant wait to watch!! When is the massage!
930063243976069120 2017-11-13 13:22:11 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Somehow I hear Frank Sinatra singing in the background...and now, the end is near and so I dress for the final curtain...https://twitter.com/ndmom/status/930051160672817153

929787236761075712 2017-11-12 19:05:26 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell  what say you?https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/929786268149575681
929777142044520449 2017-11-12 18:25:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Jonnyfishboy @vickyvette No, he just got caught and decided he wanted his marriage more. :-)
929776857620406272 2017-11-12 18:24:11 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NBCNightlyNews But is it for the better for the country??
929759462105247750 2017-11-12 17:15:04 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN But you still havent told Americans how you are going to pay for it!!!!!!
929759172798935040 2017-11-12 17:13:55 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Correct, he is not getting played by anybody, he is getting played by everybody and so is this nation!!
929699441069690880 2017-11-12 13:16:34 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell Danny, you are true religion.  Miami #1 is a stretch but okay.  After all of your hype regarding Wisc I would think you would have them in the top 4! Still some work to do for all, but the picture is coming into focus.
929691795516256256 2017-11-12 12:46:11 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @pheltzcomics What great art work.  Outstanding!
929687752341323776 2017-11-12 12:30:07 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @pgpfoundation Only if that tax payer is in the 1%.  Most Americans know the deal and it wont work!!
929562766612090880 2017-11-11 04:13:28 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NDmom Betting in the Golic household should be illegal, especially when embarrassing segments have to happen on TV. Just saying.
929562342765015040 2017-11-11 04:11:47 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell It is so clear you hate Bama, but they won.  Fought hard and won.  Point differential is a point but the victory is the key.
929509119119196166 2017-11-11 00:40:18 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC He lives in a world that is dangerous for all of us.  It is up to Congress, but nothing will happen.
929383039540572160 2017-11-11 16:19:18 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @AnitaMarks Absolutely.  Last military assignment was Miami. Fell in love with Canes, the city and the culture, so I am with you!! Go Canes!!
929380325951705089 2017-11-11 16:08:31 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @AnitaMarks Nice set up Ms. Marks, enjoy the games today!!

928446124112957445 2017-11-08 02:16:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell @NJH1688 Thought so
928445758541631488 2017-11-08 02:14:53 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell @NJH1688 Well said. Did you think of that all by yourself?
928425631192420352 2017-11-08 00:54:54 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell @RTRWLT True, but if you follow him DK continually shows his dislike, so there was no surprise. :-)
928358476207788032 2017-11-08 20:28:03 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Alyssa_Milano @renato_mariotti No just against CNN, but this will also backfire!!
928352606677848064 2017-11-08 20:04:44 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell @BamaBobblehead Exactly, that is why the next 3 weeks are going to be money and edge of your seat football because like it or not Auburn could be the destroyer in the SEC debate. Miami/ND will answer another question and the Big 10 east has already done itself in. So let the games begin!
928321760038129665 2017-11-08 18:02:09 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell You are much more the expert than I am but to me they have an uphill climb as everyone of the top 6 teams has especially this weekend.  Cant wait to see what the carnage is by late Saturday night!!
928317159939461121 2017-11-08 17:43:52 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @StephenKing Amazing when it was 140 it was not enough and now 280 is too many. We are never happy or satisfied. My goodness.
928316312656449548 2017-11-08 17:40:30 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell It is an opinion DK and everyone has one. Just like your distain for Bama. They wont get in because they wont win out!
928083638805258244 2017-11-07 02:15:57 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @realDonaldTrump @ABC What does the President believe in? I am not sure anyone in the country knows.
928081519616446465 2017-11-07 02:07:31 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate Why are you showing a blackberry if you are talking about apple??
927970327547777025 2017-11-07 18:45:41 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NDmom Was there a bet or are the Golics saving themselves this time??  The new show will be great. Cant wait!
927945976467415040 2017-11-07 17:08:55 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Deadspin True but they wont do it.  I am sorry isnt the owner infamous for a recent comment?
927581526157557760 2017-11-06 17:00:44 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NDmom Is there another photo in the Golic familys future? Or some seriously hot & spicy burgers?  Just remember the last time you picked a side.
927344942518816768 2017-11-05 01:20:38 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes Because he does not get it and has not had to get it, so it does not matter whether he does or not because in the end he does not matter.
927276387525939200 2017-11-05 20:48:13 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Broncos Colin Kaepernik is available.  You need a quarterback dont you? #SaluteToService
927275491933020161 2017-11-05 20:44:39 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @HoustonTexans Colin Kaepernik is available!  You need a quarterback, dont you? #SaluteToService

927273405455400960 2017-11-05 20:36:22 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @4golfonline Can you play it?
926953500512280577 2017-11-04 23:25:11 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate Imagine that just when the government wants to limit immigration.
926945548170645504 2017-11-04 22:53:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse Why?
926773449556508672 2017-11-04 11:29:43 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @KamalaHarris But what is going to be done about.  So far nothing and in the end nothing.  Americans have no help in congress.  Middle Class is torched!!
926632860680933376 2017-11-03 02:11:04 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes Yes and that is exactly what they want to do.  Where is your Governor or any Governor for that matter.  The tax plan is a joke!
926572892183244801 2017-11-03 22:12:47 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MikeAndMike @Tmbmd91 Easy to do but all we have to do is vote and it will end, if the gutless cannot decide to do it sooner.  Happy weekend
926560702818607104 2017-11-03 21:24:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MikeAndMike @Tmbmd91 Well it is going to get worse before it gets better unfortunately given who is running the ship
926559040100012034 2017-11-03 21:17:44 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MikeAndMike @Tmbmd91 When did I say that?  Not sure which comment you are referring to. As for Kap, he should be in the league but too many forces against.
926544112106573824 2017-11-03 20:18:25 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate Who could not see this coming.  They must go and go now!!
926400968824164352 2017-11-03 10:49:37 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MikeAndMike NFL Redzone is the greatest deterrent to viewing the network games.  See more pay less.
926399911054200833 2017-11-03 10:45:25 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Alyssa_Milano They dont care.  They are in their own world and only being voted out will change it!!
926244962987134976 2017-11-02 00:29:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN We have officially become a totalitarian state and the media wont say it. What are your jobs anyway?  Inform the nation completely perhaps
926135527002267650 2017-11-02 17:14:51 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate Have cake and eat it. Now that is realistic policy.  These people are absurd.  The rich get richer and poor, well not so much!!
926106262550532096 2017-11-02 15:18:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Espngreeny How many RISPs did the Dodgers leave in game 7.  I believe it was enough to double Houstons run total.  They just did not hit when needed
926094527559069696 2017-11-02 14:31:56 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MGolicJR57 @espngolic @NDmom Wow, both in a tie at the same time.  Is this a first for national TV??
926084916487557125 2017-11-02 13:53:44 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Deauxma Good morning Deauxma
926084759347920896 2017-11-02 13:53:07 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN That is a slimy way to try and justify sluggish sales.
926084453033791488 2017-11-02 13:51:54 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SydGolic Go ahead and do it.  You know you want too!!
925882151618441219 2017-11-01 00:28:01 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNNOpinion @CNN Why? He will act anyway he wants and leader is not one of them.

925528024711356416 2017-10-31 01:00:51 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @esquire @YAFourOhFour Unfortunately, I dont have that amount of hope. No one in the admin has given me reason to have hope and I do think hurt will happen
925524026704965632 2017-10-31 00:44:58 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @esquire Please ask Mr. Cranston why would America want Trump to succeed??
925504697686986753 2017-10-31 23:28:09 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @TheRock @CarlyBooth92 You have my vote
925503981203415042 2017-10-31 23:25:18 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell @ClemsonBrad35 Okay I stand corrected...for now #CFP
925501259926425601 2017-10-31 23:14:30 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell @ClemsonBrad35 Because they are #1 havent lost and played who is in front of them.  I am sure there are other reasons but cant think of them right now.
925500931298549760 2017-10-31 23:13:11 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Redskins Please cut Pryor and Doctson.  Get Bryant from the Steelers and then this number might mean something.  With a 3-4 record it means squat.
925477163897360385 2017-10-31 21:38:45 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Why do you lie?  ABC when will you expose her??
925476862847045634 2017-10-31 21:37:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell You are definitely losing it.  It will be Bama, UGa, Clemson, OSU, ND and ?????
924945491573559296 2017-10-30 10:26:04 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Do your job!!
924945443313913856 2017-10-30 10:25:52 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Because if they do not Americans will understand how they are getting taken and you are not helping!!  Tell us what is going on!!
924783467421978626 2017-10-29 23:42:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dallascowboys @Redskins @stephenasmith Neither Doctson or Pryor are very good.  Both need to be on another team
924739573741178881 2017-10-29 20:47:49 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse Nope. Not a tax plan that helps the 1% and hurts everyone else.  Dont need it and dont touch 401Ks
924406186971205632 2017-10-28 22:43:04 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SydGolic Your self

924085590286651392 2017-10-27 01:29:08 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN If they do pass it, they will cheat every low to middle income person who voted for Trump. Damned if they do, damned if they dont!
923700309330821121 2017-10-26 23:58:09 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NBCNightlyNews In a totalitarian world this is what happens when someone speaks out against the power elite.  I hope she keeps it up!!
923657204737208320 2017-10-26 21:06:52 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Slate So hard working average Americans no longer stand a chance against the power elite.  Wow, not the America I remember.
923645133731647488 2017-10-26 20:18:55 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Espngreeny But if the Nationals are smart they wont.  Hopefully the phone call has been made.  Come to DC Joe!!
923644649935433733 2017-10-26 20:16:59 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes @Steve_SoSquare Two parties anymore, or just one big Professional Political Class that cares only about themselves??
923644491315245056 2017-10-26 20:16:21 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes @Steve_SoSquare Yes but now it is the Republicans that passed a budget adding $1.5 Trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.  Do we really have..
923595034368278529 2017-10-26 16:59:50 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NancyPelosi @EagleKeeper15 I am not sure Americans are important to anyone in a leadership position at the moment.  And I will stand where I please, thank you.
923586460883849217 2017-10-26 16:25:46 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @morgfair @johncusack Anything to help Murdock and the few so that they can attempt to control the many.  It will not work and we must all wake up so it wont
923585842542792704 2017-10-26 16:23:18 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NancyPelosi So where is the democratic plan to stop them that all Americans can see and who is the champion for it?????  Give us something, anything!!
923580099324272640 2017-10-26 16:00:29 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes Look out red states, your safety net was just stolen and given to rich folks.  You might want to warm up that resume thanks to Republicans

923303350317314050 2017-10-25 21:40:47 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse @Rmontalbano3 Believe what you will but I would tend to disagree.
923266218949308416 2017-10-25 19:13:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SarahPalinUSA Yes, even if it continues to tear the nation apart for no good reason
923265770632765442 2017-10-25 19:11:27 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse Poppycock!  Disinformation in its highest form. The shame of it is, we know but cannot do anything about it until 2020...at the moment!
922859833010900992 2017-10-24 16:18:24 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espn Washington will take him straight up for Pryor Sr!!
922483150218985472 2017-10-23 15:21:36 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SarahPalinUSA No actually it is time we held the President accountable for all of his vile acts!!! The nation has had 40 bad weeks!!
922084853545422850 2017-10-22 12:58:55 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell You are obviously doing this to cause trouble.  You are way smarter than your list!!  Did you not see the beat down last night?  PSU and ND
922078713692479488 2017-10-22 12:34:31 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Madame Pelosi is delusional and as much a part of the problem as she is the solution.  It is time for a total revamp of Congress.
920731283113889793 2017-10-18 19:20:18 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WSJ You mean the American Rights most trusted newspaper dont you???

920730443405774848 2017-10-18 19:16:58 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @JaydenMichele That is too funny Ms. Jaymes.
920710772203950101 2017-10-18 17:58:48 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Deadspin But you took the money!!!!!!!!!!
920610404732203009 2017-10-18 11:19:59 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes That is because he has no compassion and no empathy toward anyone.  Bad leader on any level.
920447078202998785 2017-10-17 00:30:59 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC All smoke, no mirrors. He done more to divide, disown and disavow American values than any other President in my lifetime.
920237756613365760 2017-10-17 10:39:13 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC He has taken health care from his base, he is taking health care of Americans who need it, what type of non-leader is he.  Stand up America
920237513125572608 2017-10-17 10:38:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @realDonaldTrump @DeliliaOMalley When can we take America back from this bully who thinks nothing of the American people and only of himself.  We must get him out of office
920085759239053312 2017-10-16 00:35:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Unfortunately, she will never take the full blame for running a lousy campaign.  Just needs to go away.  We have no national leadership.
920085396658249728 2017-10-16 00:33:47 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN What do ratings matter. He is still President and will still divide the nation.  Lets get real and report what the admin is really trying.
919681858765500416 2017-10-15 21:50:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SportsCenter They certainly wont call Colin K.  Nope, not going to happen. No matter what.  Tis a shame and a sham

919364601950679045 2017-10-14 00:49:36 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Can we not go to war against Bannon, what he stands for and what anything he does could mean to an already divided country? Come on media!
918789116711591936 2017-10-13 10:42:50 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN You have to ask why?  Not just repeat.  Why arent you (media) challenging this?  Walter C would have had none of it.  You are letting us d
918253998863536134 2017-10-11 23:16:28 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse But it wont be fair to anyone except the 1% and you know it.
918164387243859968 2017-10-11 17:20:23 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WhiteHouse If you say it, it must be completely false.  Completely
917920675708456961 2017-10-10 01:11:57 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Variety And if you believe that I have land 50 miles east of Miami and if that does not work for you I have some more 100 miles west of the city.

917908325290921985 2017-10-10 00:22:53 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes I guess the money was just to good to do it earlier!1
917900825502081025 2017-10-10 23:53:05 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN While the country is torn apart.
917900743671271425 2017-10-10 23:52:45 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN No, not an age problem. It has a no agenda, platform, desire to defeat and no one to run problem. They are comfortable where they are...
917546447788138497 2017-10-09 00:24:54 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN It doesnt matter. It is spin, image and division.  Our nation deserves better, but we will not get better any time soon. Just tired of it.
917439486044258304 2017-10-09 17:19:53 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SeaBrinkley It was a stunt, it did not work but continues to divide.  When will they learn, the flag represents the nation, what better platform?
917437609206439936 2017-10-09 17:12:25 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC At what point in time do we stand up and say enough!  The US will not become a dictatorship!
917174525393096709 2017-10-08 23:47:01 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Dont have time for politician noise, then shut up!!
917174346900234243 2017-10-08 23:46:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Was the flag stepped on, burnt, or otherwise mistreated, I think not.  Spin, this is all spin.
917143698391097345 2017-10-08 21:44:32 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC The flag covers every citizen in America, not just a few.  This nation just deserves better leaders at the national level
917049139862626305 2017-10-08 15:28:47 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN No law against that as long as it was peaceful.  The question is, what is the motive and what can we learn from it in order to understand it
917022271100936192 2017-10-08 13:42:01 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell A real top 8, Bama, Clem, Penn St, Wash St, Georgia, TCU, Washington, doesnt matter
917021952774197248 2017-10-08 13:40:45 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell You are certainly titled to your opinion but I must disagree.  Who did Clemson play versus who Bama played?  How could Penn St drop?

916320218464604162 2017-10-06 15:12:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @NTKNet How about without bias at all
916318882520092672 2017-10-06 15:07:00 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Alyssa_Milano Sad part is, he told the truth.
916315068152844289 2017-10-06 14:51:51 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @esquire @CharlesPPierce He is just a vile and petty person who will lead this nation to ruins and needs to be replaced now!! Oh and all of his cabinet should go too
916298275866710016 2017-10-06 13:45:07 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC In government service imagine is as important as laws.  He is the Treasury Secretary, not Defense and not State so how official????
915743675799543808 2017-10-04 01:01:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Again, they believe they are above the law and it do as I say. Goes to show the hypocrisy and yet it will fade away like everything else.

915374293000867840 2017-10-03 00:33:32 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @esquire He cannot embarrassed me any longer.  He could leave office, but that wont as the nation would not be that lucky
915356373478776832 2017-10-03 23:22:20 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes @bareknucklelove No a way around the republicans
915349684390170625 2017-10-03 22:55:45 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes Democrats should stop pleading with an unrationale person and just design a way around him and the rest of congress. This story is old.
914992105214431233 2017-10-02 23:14:52 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @JaxAustin Neither pole answer gets to the issue.  Not sure what the real answer is and I am not sure anyone else in this country does either.
914661522143576064 2017-10-01 01:21:15 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN The world now sees what voting for Trump has gotten America.  I doubt they want the rest of the world wants the same.
914661340089929728 2017-10-01 01:20:31 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CNN Because he doesnt want to.  Everyone has to understand who he is and that he is not going to change.
914588907215482880 2017-10-01 20:32:42 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @latimes Dont worry they think we do not know they are lying. Of course it is for the rich, who else would get a benefit???
914575724316635141 2017-10-01 19:40:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @dannykanell Oh come on DK. Bama is 1 especially after yesterday.  Dont hate!!
914563936724414464 2017-10-01 18:53:28 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC He should not be president. Period!!
914271794152042496 2017-09-30 23:32:36 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @WSJ No even close.  Owned by a divider just like the one in the WH.
914268312560967682 2017-09-30 23:18:46 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @morningmika Of course he is not but who is going to do anything until 2020.  25 amendment is calling but no one is picking up the phone.
914228219158646784 2017-09-30 20:39:27 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT High Crimes and misdemeanors.  Need I say more.  The 25th amendment is also in play! Do something dont tweet.
913564605053620225 2017-09-28 00:42:29 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @greenfield64 Excellent point
913209346129047552 2017-09-27 01:10:49 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ChrisMurphyCT It just goes without saying the nation is in need of a change across the board and it is needed now.
913196824600694784 2017-09-27 00:21:04 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @CharBFit Of course you do a calendar. 12 months of you would lift anyones spirits.
912856672204476416 2017-09-26 01:49:25 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GolfChannel I just disagree with Mr. Love and that is that.  He has his right to an opinion, just sad it is one he articulated.
912731467171627008 2017-09-26 17:31:54 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GolfChannel Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but in this case the case of peaceful protest can and should happen in any venue.  45 is not correct.
912337142143168512 2017-09-25 15:24:59 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC Presidents should be unifiers and not dividers.  He has proven since taking office all he wants to do is divide the country and he is!!
912336908667297793 2017-09-25 15:24:04 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @ABC It has everything to do with ethnically divisive. There have been flag protest before and will be again.  He is just not the right person!!!
912274872797138944 2017-09-25 11:17:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @Redskins Yesterday was a perfect reaction to words said that should have never been said. Go back to your American history books people and read.
912274272281927680 2017-09-25 11:15:10 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MikeAndMike do not feel segments of political leadership are representing the nation and/or its ideals to support all people equally.
912273822065266689 2017-09-25 11:13:23 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MikeAndMike and remember it is our right to stand against what is wrong or in this case kneel. I support the players and all others who..
912273519525982208 2017-09-25 11:12:10 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MikeAndMike Everyone needs to remember why this country was founded in the first place and what it has taken to get us where we are today.
912273187001561088 2017-09-25 11:10:51 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MikeAndMike The protest are about America, not the flag and not the military.  American history contains many examples of protests.
911243282436456450 2017-09-22 14:58:23 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @espngolic I figured as much.  It was a strange looking donut anyway.  Enjoy the day. Love the show. Glad you will still be on air.
911216633229791232 2017-09-22 13:12:29 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @AdeMontignie @brianklaas The lets ensure we all know who says yes and make sure they are defeated next election so they have to use the system they voted in.
910326808461094912 2017-09-19 02:16:38 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @GolfChannel What will help is fewer tournaments that mean more where the best play.  Football has nothing to do with it. Oh and 30 minute rulings don't

905747523649892352 2017-09-07 11:00:12 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @MikeAndMike Until we understand there is only one race with multiple ethnicities we will never understand we are all human. Sports do that

905494996241010688 2017-09-06 18:16:45 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @KamalaHarris @native_flower73 I am not a great writer and don't have the money to do it but I have thought about open letters through newspapers.

905473999492321280 2017-09-06 16:53:19 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @KamalaHarris @native_flower73 Totally agree with you but the question is how do we motivate people to get involved to the point Congress reacts?  We need a new side
905444255027560449 2017-09-06 14:55:07 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @KamalaHarris @native_flower73 Absolutely agree with you but how many decades has it been since that has happened? And what will it take to make it happen again?
905374312357662720 2017-09-06 10:17:11 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @KamalaHarris @native_flower73 Fair point, perhaps we should at all EO's to see which provide safe haven and promote American ideals and which do not. then adjust
905232137791705089 2017-09-05 00:52:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> So you say.  Not sure I agree
905217707821457409 2017-09-05 23:54:54 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @KamalaHarris Congress needs to do more...like looking in the 25th amendment and abuse of power.  What is the democrats response. America has yet to see

901463879703834624 2017-08-26 15:18:31 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SenBlumenthal Congress has to stand and put the citizens of the country first and not stand by regardless of the professional consequences.
901463651604987904 2017-08-26 15:17:37 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @SenBlumenthal Again I ask, what are you going to do about it.  We know what has happened but the question is what is going to be done about it.

901259791938596864 2017-08-25 01:47:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @POTUS @NancyPelosi Congress needs to stop tweeting and start doing.  Inaction is allowing him to get away with it.  The next steps clearly rest with congress

752651900273696768 2016-07-11 23:52:51 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Absolutely, play should have been stopped on 18 tee box and the discussion should have been with both players.https://twitter.com/utturfpath/status/752650579109904384
752630916846059522 2016-07-11 22:29:28 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> My question is could anyone have seen the club touch the sand without TV...no and even then it was slow motion.https://twitter.com/golfchannel/status/752628983850729472

752623067172573186 2016-07-11 21:58:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Thank you but it does give pause as you have to wonder how many grains of sand were moved during and not noticed. https://twitter.com/dottie_pepper/status/752619473023168512
752616938103271424 2016-07-11 21:33:55 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Part 3. Are going to use TV then don't you need a camera with every group on the course to document an infraction? https://twitter.com/dottie_pepper/status/752548588543172608
752616724625776640 2016-07-11 21:33:04 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Part 2. and not caught on camera. If this was not a playoff would the TV had caught that? So the question is if you https://twitter.com/dottie_pepper/status/752548588543172608
752616513320935424 2016-07-11 21:32:14 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Part 1. Ms Pepper here is what I do not understand.  How many grains of sand were moved throughout the tournament https://twitter.com/dottie_pepper/status/752548588543172608

752311684568612864 2016-07-10 01:20:57 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @bkatrek One more. Did Fox become an interested observer as David Fey admitted to alerting the rules officials. #USWomensOpen
752311331278221312 2016-07-10 01:19:33 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Extremely classy and professional.  Best of luck going forward. Great playing and you are so right!! #USWomensOpenhttps://twitter.com/anordqvist/status/752304012477632512
752303537091207168 2016-07-10 00:48:35 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> @bkatrek Do you think Fox is partly at fault for this and have you ever touched the sand even a grain? I think it is terrible for the game.
752299683167498242 2016-07-10 00:33:16 UTC <Fletch1Benjamin> Can't wait to hear your show tomorrow. There has to be a way to take the video out of the sport.https://twitter.com/bkatrek/status/752297699953770496
