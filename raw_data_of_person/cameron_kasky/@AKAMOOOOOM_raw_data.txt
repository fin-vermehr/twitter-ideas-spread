972158739737464835 2018-03-09 17:14:40 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I would rather go through childbirth again than have this miserable flu and have to take care of 3 kids.  My hair hurts
971228066512101378 2018-03-06 03:36:30 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I am a 36 year old Mom of 3. Today, I got carded buying a bottle of wine! #winning  Also; I feel like a sad and pathetic person because my biggest excitement is getting carded
971185927963009024 2018-03-06 00:49:03 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @OurAmericana @HRC This is my town! I love this community, thank you for sharing our story!
971185749579259904 2018-03-06 00:48:21 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> This is my town and some good friends of mine, LOVE my community!!https://twitter.com/HRC/status/971052284338720768
971183424865267718 2018-03-06 00:39:06 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> My sister in law tweets about fine cheeses and got @AskingAmy to be her Twitter BFF. What can I tweet about that will find me my Twitter BFF?
971073253908385792 2018-03-06 17:21:20 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @TheCatWhisprer Facebook buy, sell, trade groups are the new way to go, hustled up $60 for shit I don't want to move! #porchpickup
971072890161557506 2018-03-06 17:19:53 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Had a two hour school delay today and still managed to miss the bus! #momfail #momlife
967237860062646272 2018-02-23 03:20:50 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> You are amazing. As a mother I will do whatever I can to keep all of our children safe. With my voice, my vote, my faith, I will not be complicit @Emma4Change
967177929447919618 2018-02-23 23:22:42 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> No school today = me taking all 3 kids with me to get my taxes done! Hearing we have to pay in $2500 was less painful than trying to keep them occupied during the appointment
967035541450625024 2018-02-23 13:56:54 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @PeachyParenting I say that about my minivan but I suppose I have to let the kids ride in it at some point!
967034853693812736 2018-02-23 13:54:10 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @Katerina51 Cool! I would love to follow some of these students and watch as they graduate and kick sad in this world!!
966473995586555904 2018-02-21 00:45:31 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I ran errands with two toddlers today so naturally I peed in a public bathroom with the stall door wide open #momlife #toddlersarecrazy
966473589955485696 2018-02-21 00:43:54 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I had a plumber at my house today with the water shut off do I spent $80 at the grocery store so I could take a pee.
965973973073891329 2018-02-20 15:38:36 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> My 3yo son has decided to dress in Spiderman pajamas as attire today and I have decided to pick my battles! #momlife #parenting
965420853100937217 2018-02-18 03:00:42 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I'm at the age where my body still hurts after a full night's sleep.  #gettingold #gettingoldsucks

964622990309720067 2018-02-16 22:10:17 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @MizzTangles More importantly: did it work? Asking for a friend...
964538420159709185 2018-02-16 16:34:14 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @ShawnMendes see you are playing Summerfest in MKE 7/5, can't wait to buy tickets for my daughter's 9th birthday!!
964195293800648710 2018-02-15 17:50:46 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I'm an "edgy Mom"; meaning I clean my bathroom with bleach while wearing all black because I like to dangerously.....
964137090563928067 2018-02-15 13:59:29 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> If you are someone who argues against stronger gun control because of "rights", then I don't want to EVER hear you bitch about a football player taking a knee or a woman having an abortion.
963460390842654720 2018-02-13 17:10:32 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Why does Daniel Tiger listen to his Mom when she sings directions at him and my kids look at me like I have two heads?
963450672422309894 2018-02-13 16:31:55 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I will be amongst the parents at my local @Walgreens at 7:30 this evening desperately buying up the last of the Valentine's cards for my kid to take to school tomorrow!  #momlife
960327004460584960 2018-02-04 01:39:34 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Haha, #TheVoice has been my favorite #SuperBowl52 commercial!!
960318923941040129 2018-02-04 01:07:27 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @PRyan @politicalmiller @RepJoeKennedy @Sarcher @kayteterry Right, I was going to say; I'm self employed, I take more home per week when I'm busier! Lol
960295096691326983 2018-02-04 23:32:47 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> It might be Patriots vs Eagles in #SuperBowlLII but this Wisconsin family is still rooting for the #GreenBayPackers! #FamilyGreatly #KraftEntrypic.twitter.com/rSn0jECxQN
957824540285038592 2018-01-28 03:55:40 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @St4rNewz @rihanna ALWAYS looks beautiful!!
957824001216319488 2018-01-28 03:53:32 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Happy to see a local, yet national, drummer get recognized at #TheGrammys tonight. RIP Clyde Stubblefield..

957806717982707719 2018-01-28 02:44:51 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @St4rNewz Her performance had way more volume than her hair, that was pure power!!
957806165974568960 2018-01-28 02:42:39 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @SPIN Incredible performance!!!!

957706440340275200 2018-01-28 20:06:23 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @ValeeGrrl My husband has been doing this all weekend,  he's so cute when he says we are "never having another baby or animal in this house. Like he gets to decide! 
952697026705350656 2018-01-14 00:20:46 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> It is 15 minutes until dinner time and I have a 3 year old boy who hasn't napped today, please pray.
951663566192562176 2018-01-11 03:54:09 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Rain plus temps rapidly dropping to 20 degrees ='s my SUV frozen shut after work. Like any badass WI chick I put up my hood and walked home in the now snow. In heels, carrying a basket full of towels  (hairdresser) #WIwinter
950804607827107840 2018-01-09 19:00:58 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> The fuckery that is my life; we sold our house over the weekend,  inspection is tomorrow, so naturally there would be a water main break that shuts water off in the neighbourhood and puts a giant hole in the street!
949292600678404096 2018-01-05 14:52:47 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I survived over 30 years without a spoon rest for my stove and yet when I can't find it a Hulk-like rage ensues #whitepeopleproblems
949286629570695168 2018-01-05 14:29:04 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Finally got all my  Christmas decor into storage yesterday.  So, of course, this morning I find one rogue ornament in the middle of the floor....
942944365495881729 2017-12-18 02:27:10 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> It's the most wonderful time of the year! Tree is up, stockings are hung and half my collectible ornaments are on the kitchen counter waiting for repair! #christmastree
941685427173457921 2017-12-15 15:04:36 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @dlcardoza I've got my fingers crossed I'm going to get my 3 yo potty trained! Good luck to you!
941552701837541376 2017-12-14 06:17:11 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> If a kid "updates" their Santa list without showing a parent and then proceeds to stamp and put it in the very narrow outgoing mail slot of a commercial building is it a felony to try and retrieve? Asking for a friend  #parenting
940813457364062209 2017-12-12 05:19:42 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @Itswinethirtyx I, too, have an 18 month old, Godspeed Mom!

936004946650189824 2017-11-29 22:52:24 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I told her we didn't need to feed the fish right now. #whymytoddleriscryingpic.twitter.com/oLyVzeukSy

934794750154096641 2017-11-26 14:43:30 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @realDonaldTrump NO!! A PEDOPHILE is bad, why can't you understand this??!! NO PEDOPHILES IN OFFICE!
934793985679278080 2017-11-26 14:40:28 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @SamsungMobileUS As someone who had to begrudgingly return my Note 7 I would love a sweet discount on a Note 8!
934793223653822464 2017-11-26 14:37:26 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> If your strongest rebuttal to any criticism of Donald Trump is "Well, Hillary would have done it too..." you seriously need to do some more reading. Quit excusing our shitty president, especially by comparing him to what you GUESS the alternative would have been.....
934791712492290048 2017-11-26 14:31:26 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @SenSanders @danintheoutback She's not the president so I really don't give a shit! Why are we still so concerned about Hillary??
934784232156565504 2017-11-26 14:01:43 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @SenSanders @danintheoutback I'm glad you have psychic powers to know exactly what Clinton would have done but I'm more concerned with the actual President and this garbage tax plan that will screw me, a small business owner just trying to make 40k and feed my kids. Moot point, that you can't even prove
934679380546043905 2017-11-25 07:05:04 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @chrissyteigen Sorry, Wisconsin girl, Go Badgers! See you next week!
934556949995311104 2017-11-25 22:58:34 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @TragicAllyHere Or how about women also doing it for men? As in, everyone does it for each other,  regardless of gender!
934253016181489664 2017-11-24 02:50:51 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @ValeeGrrl It's that time of year I can't remember where the fuck I hid it last year!
934222095822741504 2017-11-24 00:47:59 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> My kids are so excited for Elf on the Shelf to return! Now if only I could remember where I put the thing #momfail #elfontheshelf
932805456224952320 2017-11-20 02:58:46 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I dont need to wrote that down, I'll remember! #WhiteLiesToMyself
932799005641158656 2017-11-20 02:33:08 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @scottEweinberg My kids are out of the house. That's gonna be a looong time from now!
932702082070560768 2017-11-20 20:07:59 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> The hardest part about taking care of 3 kids while sick isn't actually taking care of them - it's trying not to pee myself every time I sneeze
931697703200858113 2017-11-17 01:36:57 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> My last baby is 18 months old today! pic.twitter.com/EuzKvnAvfX

930110574620426240 2017-11-13 16:30:16 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @Itswinethirtyx My kid lived in pjs this weekend because I was too lazy to dress him. At least you had an excuse, and I'm sure she was living her dream! You're not a #badmom #badmom you are a #normalmom !
929733986464567296 2017-11-12 15:33:50 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @MathisTheDude @CanadianDev @shartravel Yep, God will handle it, no need to vote in the next election, you can stay home that day!
929733658650427392 2017-11-12 15:32:32 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @realDonaldTrump We don't exactly want to be friendly with North Korea. And you are old,  sorry,  but it's true. Enjoy your AARP discounts and be thankful for a change.
929732730820034560 2017-11-12 15:28:51 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @CNN @rosemcgowan You have such a pretty singing voice! I bet you could do a whole album of Fuck You songs, it's not like 2017 leaves us short on material....

919958976397172736 2017-10-16 16:11:26 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @Sharkyl Yeah, but I use the term "President " pretty loosely....
919958818859057152 2017-10-16 16:10:49 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> It doesn't matter what happened,  it matters that it still happens.  It needs to stop.  #MeToo
919762531828170752 2017-10-15 03:10:50 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @Sharkyl You have to tag @realDonaldTrump, otherwise he might not see it....
919745613230510080 2017-10-15 02:03:36 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I find it ironic that a person who staunchly supports a terrorists 2amend. rights to bear arms argues against another's right to kneel...?
919371061283532801 2017-10-14 01:15:16 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @AndyRichter I leant my neighbor our wheelbarrow,  basically the same, right?

918966266324426752 2017-10-13 22:26:46 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @realDonaldTrump Actually, we can worship whomever we want,  even if you don't like it. They're called rights. Religious freedom founded this country, duh.
918883432381288448 2017-10-13 16:57:36 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @realDonaldTrump Really?! And how, EXACTLY, do you think that will work? Is it opposite day??

917768595832049664 2017-10-10 15:07:39 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @vulture Or, here's a crazy thought,  he could have not sexually assaulted people in the first place....
917042246729449472 2017-10-08 15:01:24 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Ask a Mom if she would rather get a full nights sleep or win the lottery. And watch her hesitate.
916304450335121408 2017-10-06 14:09:39 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Ridiculousness in parenting is when you cut your kids apple to look like chix nuggets and french fries.

915772984538877952 2017-10-04 02:57:48 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I didn't get into any heated gun debates online today.  I commented mostly in Gif's on FB.  It was a pretty good day!

915258248273444865 2017-10-03 16:52:25 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I don't know definitively if gun control would work. But I do know it makes me sick we aren't willing to try something, anything!!
915180855273730048 2017-10-03 11:44:53 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Maybe instead of saying Tom Petty died we should phrase it as "Keith Richards outlived another one!"

898042135403839488 2017-08-16 04:41:44 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> So, I'm a little behind but who is the leader of this "alt-left" movement? Sounds interesting
898028638137753600 2017-08-16 03:48:06 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> I can't for the life of me understand why people waste so much physical and mental energy on something as counterproductive as hate #sad

891007594369765376 2017-07-28 18:48:59 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @realDonaldTrump What about a woman who lost her ovaries, uterus and breasts to cancer? Since she has no female genitalia, should she not be allowed?

878796267916275712 2017-06-24 02:05:32 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Our 2yo insisted on emptying his own potty chair today. It was both adorable and disgusting  #pottytraining #momlife
878795973056749568 2017-06-24 02:04:21 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Our 8yo had a sleepover tonight so she had to FaceTime her friend 4 times before going...
878238620565372930 2017-06-23 13:09:38 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @amandajsage21 We have 3 with our last two being 18 months apart and, somehow, it is. It's the lowering of standards of productivity and accomplishment!
876181415423090690 2017-06-17 20:55:02 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> It's probably not appropriate to add "Pooped in peace for 5 minutes " to my Faceboook life events, right?
872260922139693056 2017-06-06 01:16:24 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> New record: my kids said they didn't like my dinner even before I started cooking! #momlife #Imhungry

867549887818280960 2017-05-24 01:16:26 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @TwinSurvivalist I need 12 chip clips because my kids have to open the second bag of anything long before the first is finished!

858034300192772096 2017-04-28 19:04:53 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> My favorite garage sale people are the ones who won't even get out of their car to look for stuff and just shout out what they want.  #not

842804269099237376 2017-03-17 18:26:10 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Something new I learned: instead of a chocolate fountain, you can get a RANCH DRESSING fountain! You're welcome.... #ranchoneverything
842779633749757953 2017-03-17 16:48:17 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Well, a self employed Mom of 3 and I paid my taxes today, how about YOU @realDonaldTrump??
842408874992902145 2017-03-16 16:15:01 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @JohnFugelsang @AkilahObviously and then I assume he will find a way to use taxpayer dollars to fund it
842408154763784192 2017-03-16 16:12:09 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @realDonaldTrump it's also hard to be prosperous without a good education, and if you die because you have no health care.....
842040476303802373 2017-03-15 15:51:08 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump I'm sure some do. Probably the same ones who think you're doing a good job
842039009761214465 2017-03-15 15:45:18 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> It is parental law that the first thing that will go into your garbage after you've just emptied it is the world's stinkiest diaper #momlife
841711609512894468 2017-03-14 18:04:20 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @JarettSays Yeah, the title sounds like something I would catch my kids doing! Can't wait to see it, in about 5 years probably, lol

832667999635128320 2017-02-17 19:08:15 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> When my kids ask for Lucky Charms cereal I think to myself "just cut the middle man and buy a bag of marshmallows." #parenting #momlife

831542976136478720 2017-02-14 16:37:49 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> There is a point in #parenting that your brain could rationalize some very questionable things in exchange for a solid nights sleep #momlife

830974944272117761 2017-02-12 03:00:40 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @Adele @pitchfork maybe Mariah Carey should take note on what to do next time her performance doesn't go so smoothly
830972927625551873 2017-02-12 02:52:39 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> Mariah Carey take note: @Adele is showing you how to gracefully fix a performance blunder! #GRAMMYs
830946865994661892 2017-02-12 01:09:05 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> You look away for a millisecond to watch the #GRAMMYs and all of a sudden: 2 naked children dancing in my living room! #momlife

827606468652306432 2017-02-03 19:55:32 UTC <AKAMOOOOOM> @GovWalker I think expanding Medicaid rather than cutting it is a better way to show your commitment to a healthy population
