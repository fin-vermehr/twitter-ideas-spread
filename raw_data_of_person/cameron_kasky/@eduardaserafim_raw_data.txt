850779095378124804 2017-04-08 18:35:17 UTC <eduardaserafim> the company that discovers the cure can patent it and make triple the amount of money that is currently made by donations to research
850778818629513217 2017-04-08 18:34:11 UTC <eduardaserafim> the conspiracy that says the cure for cancer has already been discovered but is being withheld as a money ploy is baseless

847257019299930112 2017-03-29 01:19:49 UTC <eduardaserafim> the end of the marking period means working twice as hard because one grade can either drop your average by 30% or raise it by .01%

842342268187090945 2017-03-16 11:50:21 UTC <eduardaserafim> yes because what we need is to cut money given to communities + the environment and instead give that money to the military. amazing!

811999962489847808 2016-12-22 18:20:51 UTC <eduardaserafim> no offense but I hate high school students
811782910936281088 2016-12-21 03:58:22 UTC <eduardaserafim> this is so incredibly fucked up http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/court-police-can-shoot-dog-if-it-moves-or-barks-when-cop-enters-home/article/2610097 https://twitter.com/spanishcvndy/status/811448264721477632
811777199242149888 2016-12-21 03:35:41 UTC <eduardaserafim> @Complex regardless of his reputation, people are spreading false information about his plane videos and are choosing to ignore Delta's racist past
811713139523940352 2016-12-21 23:21:08 UTC <eduardaserafim> sources?
811703358230822912 2016-12-21 22:42:15 UTC <eduardaserafim> I'm just saying, try actually watching the videos that you're reporting on before spreading lies about Adam Saleh. #BoycottDelta
811702029785690113 2016-12-21 22:36:59 UTC <eduardaserafim> he was w/ his friend in a plane making a joke for 10 seconds of a video. people are incorrectly reporting that as a history of plane pranks.
811700171146936320 2016-12-21 22:29:36 UTC <eduardaserafim> People love spreading misinformation! We really have a problem with people only reading headlines and not the actual articles.
811699758599315456 2016-12-21 22:27:57 UTC <eduardaserafim> @cloudapp @forrestbmac those videos are not prank videos. they're vlogs with small sections of him being in a plane. watch them before you spread misinformation.
811699480630349824 2016-12-21 22:26:51 UTC <eduardaserafim> @cloudapp @forrestbmac instead of reading headlines and titles and thinking you know the real story, delve deeper and actually read/watch the content.
811699198282305537 2016-12-21 22:25:44 UTC <eduardaserafim> yes do you? because you should watch his videos and realize that they are not, in fact, pranks
811696923996487680 2016-12-21 22:16:41 UTC <eduardaserafim> Before you go out and make claims to debunk this man's discrimination, do your actual research and realize he's the victim. #BoycottDelta
811696572840939521 2016-12-21 22:15:18 UTC <eduardaserafim> Adam Saleh does not have any history of plane prank videos, if you watch his videos you can clearly see that. #BoycottDelta
811696174948302849 2016-12-21 22:13:43 UTC <eduardaserafim> and they're actually just vlogs with only a section of him being in a plane. The titles are just to grab people's attention. (2/2)https://twitter.com/communism_kills/status/811601493166030848
811695962200612864 2016-12-21 22:12:52 UTC <eduardaserafim> maybe before reporting on something you should actually watch these videos to realize that they are not actually pranks or "scenes" (1/2)https://twitter.com/communism_kills/status/811601493166030848
811392983379611648 2016-12-20 02:08:56 UTC <eduardaserafim> I'm done for the rest of the week, my brain needs a hard reset

797446960529702912 2016-11-12 14:32:25 UTC <eduardaserafim> White voters can afford to overlook racism and prejudice for their political agenda. They're only paying attention to what affects them.https://twitter.com/rvawonk/status/796919679180750848
796794866466488320 2016-11-10 19:21:14 UTC <eduardaserafim> the only silver lining to all of this is the prospect of an antiestablishment art and music renaissance
