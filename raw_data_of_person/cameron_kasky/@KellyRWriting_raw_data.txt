Older Bro grabs the knife.   Younger Bro watches Older Bro cut/take a huge piece: "Hey, that's not fair! We both *want*  the biggest piece. Let's use the "you cut it, I pick it" rule.

953815771016323073 2018-01-17 02:26:15 UTC <KellyRWriting> It wasn't that he stayed completely silent while I pleaded with him to stop, saying "no" over & over again, almost like he wanted me to have no doubt he could hear me, but also so I'd know he just chose not to listen.
953815769518886912 2018-01-17 02:26:15 UTC <KellyRWriting> The worst part about being sexually assaulted by a high school classmate wasn't the act itself.

953341324945690624 2018-01-16 19:00:58 UTC <KellyRWriting> @jodfreyo Another serious question: what kinds of opposing views/beliefs could they propose that don't have their origins in religion? For example, what's the *secular* version of christian creationism (that would be the opposing view to evolution)?
953340366882856961 2018-01-16 18:57:10 UTC <KellyRWriting> @jodfreyo They would lose their minds.
953272842883354624 2018-01-16 14:28:51 UTC <KellyRWriting> @RobTaylorIowa, a more specific question: Will the "opposing view points/beliefs" need to have gone through repeatable testing/experiments like scientific theories?https://twitter.com/KellyRWriting/status/952906532525690880
953260987276234752 2018-01-16 13:41:44 UTC <KellyRWriting> @jodfreyo This is such a good point. The bill includes the "this isn't about religion" section, but they wouldn't be welcoming of "opposing view points/beliefs" that don't have christian origins.

953059850736586752 2018-01-15 00:22:30 UTC <KellyRWriting> My state rep is trying to discredit science & sneak religious education into our public schools (ignoring Edwards v. Aguillard?). And he's doing it by equating results derived from the scientific method with "opposing points of view or beliefs".

944173090799529985 2017-12-22 11:49:41 UTC <KellyRWriting> @nhannahjones YES! My in-laws win The @TheRoot's game of racist bingo blackout, but they lost their minds when I suggested their votes for trump signaled their true beliefs.https://www.theroot.com/notracists-be-like-the-top-10-phrases-used-by-peop-1819142064
944170669289476097 2017-12-22 11:40:04 UTC <KellyRWriting> @Cie2011 Their evilness is the manifestation of their most deeply held values. George Lakoff spells it out brilliantly.  https://georgelakoff.com/2011/02/19/what-conservatives-really-want/pic.twitter.com/wav9gpNy3n
944170068069552130 2017-12-22 11:37:40 UTC <KellyRWriting> @RepDavidYoung your #GOPTaxTheft is ROBBING my hard-working, middle-class, paycheck-to-paycheck family of $850. That's how much our taxes will be INCREASING. How is that OK with you? You KNEW this would happen. I'll dm you my address so you can mail me a check.
944168642677272576 2017-12-22 11:32:00 UTC <KellyRWriting> The narcissistic, vengeful man-child in the Oval office is turning this country into what other nations have believed about us for years. His projection, and obsession with wall-building, is as obvious as his morally criminal tax theft.https://twitter.com/JohnBrennan/status/943950252062707713
944163259858456579 2017-12-22 11:10:37 UTC <KellyRWriting> @Morning_Joe, you know what else is "a lot of money" & has "a big impact?" $850, which is how much my hard-working, middle-class, paycheck-to-paycheck family's taxes will be INCREASING thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. Trump lies again!
944044769541591041 2017-12-21 03:19:47 UTC <KellyRWriting> @ProRoMo If she moves on to your *oven* youre legally bound to let her live with you when shes old and senile instead of putting her in a home. #SOWorthIt
944043813068304384 2017-12-21 03:15:59 UTC <KellyRWriting> When I block right-wing nut jobs, its not because Im worried about them bursting my liberal bubble. Im *open* to bubble-burstingIm a former christian-now-atheist. Its that the trumpTV folks dont bring anything original to the discussion.

944022748652888064 2017-12-21 01:52:17 UTC <KellyRWriting> @JKH2 He was just jealous. He wants protruding nipples so it's easier for his sycophants to suckle on them. He knows he doesn't have any other, uh, appendage big enough...not that it doesn't stop them from trying. [Sorry...too much?]

944007423123222528 2017-12-21 00:51:23 UTC <KellyRWriting> @fawfulfan YES! Here's the 2017 1040: Standard deduction $12,700 for joint filers. In my 3-person, paycheck-to-paycheck family, we get $12,500 in exemptions. That's $24,850. The #GOPTaxScam at $24,000 INCREASES our tax liability by $850!! Which @GOP POS is mailing me a fucking check?pic.twitter.com/IBtSuVCEHx
944003135906963459 2017-12-21 00:34:20 UTC <KellyRWriting> @jasonnobleDMR This reminds me of about 7 episodes of Parks & Rec. Could be because April and Andy had a 3-legged pit bull. Nah. Its more than that.
943965081901166593 2017-12-21 22:03:08 UTC <KellyRWriting> @KELLYWEILL @SlackerGeorge Right?! I mean they open their case with "we'll present no evidence that any of the defendants committed any acts of violence or any vandalism." I guess I thought that was the basis for proceeding to trial. 
943963001719312394 2017-12-21 21:54:52 UTC <KellyRWriting> @AnandWrites It's so soothing to read something that clears my brain of all things trump.
943891251274878977 2017-12-21 17:09:45 UTC <KellyRWriting> @mattyglesias Also, anyone who's expecting a refund doesn't wait until April to do their taxes. We need that money for more "booze, women and movies."
943890892435410945 2017-12-21 17:08:20 UTC <KellyRWriting> @ChuckGrassley @IndivisibleIowa Or he doesn't approve of McCabe spending all his pennies on "booze, women and movies." 
943848095258996736 2017-12-21 14:18:16 UTC <KellyRWriting> @Rosie @Cie2011 And I managed to make that about me... Boo!! Thank you for your service to our kids, especially if TN undervalues teachers like IA does. Double-boo!!  #EnglishTeachersROCK
943847117004640256 2017-12-21 14:14:23 UTC <KellyRWriting> @Rosie @randyriv1 @Cie2011 That SUCKS! I'm so sorry. Reminds me of Office Depot TV ad when I was pregnant: 1st shot: Husband tells wife, "No buying supplies for your students!"  2nd shot: Wife sees husband at OD secretly buying supplies; mouths ""  Me to my husband []: You'd do the same thing!
943839624136396800 2017-12-21 13:44:36 UTC <KellyRWriting> @Rosie @Cie2011 @randyriv1 Mine are INCREASING almost $800. I'm the sole provider for my middle-class, pay-to-pay check family. trump promised there wouldn't be ANY increase for ppl like me.

943682567122948096 2017-12-20 03:20:31 UTC <KellyRWriting> @jbouie Here in Iowa, according to our demented senator @ChuckGrassley, we'd spend that $18 on "booze, women and movies." And he's so out of touch he thinks $18 would cover all three.
943681730438991877 2017-12-20 03:17:11 UTC <KellyRWriting> @PoliticusSarah @RyanTakesNaps Good point, but we're not dealing with the brightest bulb on the string of orange christmas tree lights though...
943662183182946306 2017-12-20 01:59:31 UTC <KellyRWriting> @PoliticusSarah I bet hes *really* delaying so Rs dont jump on the impeachment train. They need his signature & theyll keep sucking his teats until they get it.

943641165387223040 2017-12-20 00:36:00 UTC <KellyRWriting> @brianschatz It's super guaranteed that everyone who's against the corrupt @GOP & their #GOPTaxScam won't forget to get rid of them.
943640268514955264 2017-12-20 00:32:26 UTC <KellyRWriting> Bonuses are typically paid based on past performance whereas salary increases are an investment in future performance. These bonuses are just hush money & are a scintilla of what CEOs will get. #GOPTaxScamhttps://thinkprogress.org/trump-tax-buybacks-5f9f78cf6e27/
943639197658820608 2017-12-20 00:28:11 UTC <KellyRWriting> @JuddLegum Also, bonuses are paid based on *past* performance (i.e. not directly tied to #GOPTaxScam) whereas salary increases are a gamble on future performance. These bonuses are just hush money & are probably a scintilla of what CEOs will get.

943632250972852224 2017-12-20 00:00:35 UTC <KellyRWriting> @FeministaJones Yes! I don't think I'll ever stop feeling that sense of wonder. Thank you for reminding me to stop & notice it.
943630893192708096 2017-12-20 23:55:11 UTC <KellyRWriting> @FredHubbell Yes! My middle class family's taxes are going to INCREASE by almost $800, thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. I wonder which one of my congress people will be sending me a check... #CornFieldElitists
943627873356787712 2017-12-20 23:43:11 UTC <KellyRWriting> @NapiChulo @_hoemo Very true.
943627762878869504 2017-12-20 23:42:45 UTC <KellyRWriting> @_hoemo @NapiChulo Yup.

943623597691752449 2017-12-20 23:26:12 UTC <KellyRWriting> @_hoemo @NapiChulo YES! And Sec 7 of Labor Relations Act applies to non-union employers too. I work for a Fortune 500 co that actually smacks down supervisors who try to stop employees from talking about pay. Protected, concerted activity, baby!
943594949978873863 2017-12-20 21:32:21 UTC <KellyRWriting> I'd like to send a big FU to @ChuckGrassley @SenJoniErnst @RepDavidYoung for the "middle class" tax cut that's going to INCREASE my middle class family's taxes by almost $800.

943529546464276480 2017-12-20 17:12:28 UTC <KellyRWriting> @JakeSherman As per usual, trump's saying the quiet part loud. #GOPTaxScam
943465683400216576 2017-12-20 12:58:42 UTC <KellyRWriting> @ChuckGrassley Sit down & shut up. Let me explain what you "simplified."  #CornFieldElitist #GOPTaxScamhttps://twitter.com/KellyRWriting/status/943464459984654337
943465082901626880 2017-12-20 12:56:19 UTC <KellyRWriting> @ChuckGrassley Nope, from one Iowan to another.https://twitter.com/KellyRWriting/status/943464459984654337
943464480993931264 2017-12-20 12:53:55 UTC <KellyRWriting> If republicans REALLY wanted to help the poor/middle class, they would have given the biggest tax cuts directly to them.   We are not dumb. And we are going to vote.
943464478326382594 2017-12-20 12:53:55 UTC <KellyRWriting> But republicans' want us to believe the "shortest distance" between the east/west coast of the U.S. (wealthy & poor) is via a leisurely swim from NY to France & a walking tour through Europe, Africa & Asia, followed by a paddle boat to LA, instead of heading due west on I-80.
943464476917030913 2017-12-20 12:53:54 UTC <KellyRWriting> Here's the thing though: the shortest distance between two points is (almost always) a straight line.
943464474203295744 2017-12-20 12:53:54 UTC <KellyRWriting> Republicans just gave corporations (& their CEOs) a bigger tax cut than their workers. Republicans want us to believe that corporations & The Economy in turn will share it with workers.
943464471565164544 2017-12-20 12:53:53 UTC <KellyRWriting> Republicans are digging deep into the lie they've been telling us about corporate tax cuts primarily benefiting American workers. This is not reality & hasn't been for years.
943464469111492608 2017-12-20 12:53:52 UTC <KellyRWriting> My company is flush with cash. We've had a remarkable year. But like every other publicly traded company, we're beholden first/foremost to stockholders. This is simply how it's done, folks.
943464467429494785 2017-12-20 12:53:52 UTC <KellyRWriting> Guess what else is pretty much flat at my company? Staffing levels. Every leader/manager I talk with says the same thing: they can barely get permission to replace staff that leave, forget about ADDING staff.
943464464740909056 2017-12-20 12:53:51 UTC <KellyRWriting> My company has lobbyists. I guarantee they've been following this tax bill & communicating with our senior leaders/board of directors. They knew this was coming & they used that info to make spending decisions.
943464461578403845 2017-12-20 12:53:51 UTC <KellyRWriting> You know the oodles ofrepublicans promised companies would pour into their employees' pockets? IT'S NOT THERE! If I wasn't paying attention to the news, I'd look at our salary budget & wouldn't be able to differentiate it from any recent past years'.
943464459984654337 2017-12-20 12:53:50 UTC <KellyRWriting> I work in Human Resources at a Fortune 500 company. We set our salary budget for 2018 a couple of months ago. Like most companies, we do it by using a crystal ball to estimate how we/the market will perform in 2018.
943441645504204800 2017-12-20 11:23:11 UTC <KellyRWriting> Republicans aren't just shoveling more to the wealthy/corporations b/c they're worried about re-election. They're doing it b/c they BELIEVE the poor DESERVE to be poor & the wealthy DESERVE to be even more wealthy. These are their values. https://georgelakoff.com/2011/02/19/what-conservatives-really-want/pic.twitter.com/voBZCvC2FG

943305253981708288 2017-12-19 02:21:12 UTC <KellyRWriting> @RepDavidYoung And I want you to explain to hardworking Iowans how you decided to give 83% of all the "savings" to the top 1%.

943148283106603010 2017-12-19 15:57:28 UTC <KellyRWriting> The most disingenuous thing Paul Ryan said this morning is that he's interested in getting ppl out of poverty. Why? Because he's a conservative & helping the poor goes against their deeply held core values (see link). #GOPTaxScam  Cc: @IronStache https://georgelakoff.com/2011/02/19/what-conservatives-really-want/pic.twitter.com/L75Me66qRR

841488951361863681 2017-03-13 03:19:34 UTC <KellyRWriting> My grandfather was 1 of 5.5m Americans with Alzheimers. If he was alive now, hed be 1 of 5m fewer people covered by Medicad by 2018. 14/
841488699313520640 2017-03-13 03:18:34 UTC <KellyRWriting> It would have been my grandfathers escalating demented violence against my grandmother or his middle-of-the night wanderings. 13/
841488633353904129 2017-03-13 03:18:18 UTC <KellyRWriting> I didnt really understand the extent Medicad played in their lives until this year. Without it, divorce wouldnt have cleaved them. 12/

841488292344410112 2017-03-13 03:16:57 UTC <KellyRWriting> They did the only thing they could: They got divorced. After 50 years of marriage. 8/
841488250678194176 2017-03-13 03:16:47 UTC <KellyRWriting> They had too much $ for Medicad, so theyd have to pay for LT care out of pocket. Itd only be a few months before their $ ran out. 7/
841488019622359040 2017-03-13 03:15:52 UTC <KellyRWriting> But that health insurance didnt cover long-term/LT care he needed when my grandmother couldn't provide itlung cancer will do that. 6/
841487811882672132 2017-03-13 03:15:03 UTC <KellyRWriting> They retired as upper middle-class. They had good health insurance fr. his decades working at our towns local newspaper, @gazettedotcom. 5/
841487659562389504 2017-03-13 03:14:26 UTC <KellyRWriting> He & my grandmother were married almost 50 yrs before he started wandering at night & shoving her into walls when she tried to stop him. 4/

841487322277376000 2017-03-13 03:13:06 UTC <KellyRWriting> My grandfather died from Alzheimers. He was 1 of 10 people 65 & older who suffered from it, 1 of the 5.5m Americans who lived with it 2/
