966948903038763010 2018-02-23 08:12:38 UTC <lurie_john> @MikeFennelly it would be more practical if poor people paid for it out of their taxes
966947518482231296 2018-02-23 08:07:08 UTC <lurie_john> @hyperphelan no, you are missing the point!
966946530828537856 2018-02-23 08:03:12 UTC <lurie_john> This is a really good idea. Another good idea is to install an indoor pool at the White House and fill it with walruses all named Carl.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/966660169194229761
966914358830747648 2018-02-22 05:55:22 UTC <lurie_john> If teachers were armed when I went to school, we would have played - Who can get Mr Riley to threaten us with his gun the most times before lunch.  or - Let's hide Mrs Goldman's gun in the flower pot.  Have things changed that much?

966881420705546242 2018-02-22 03:44:29 UTC <lurie_john> @msjuliap I feel like I can relax a bit because of these kids
966880239484780546 2018-02-22 03:39:47 UTC <lurie_john> @sheehan_cc they have been carrying since 1920
966879562649882632 2018-02-22 03:37:06 UTC <lurie_john> @bbrewin @Fizzhogg so, this is pretty much all your fault
966878253834125313 2018-02-22 03:31:54 UTC <lurie_john> @shlepcar nah, Jesus died because he was so beautiful that he made the kind of people who pretend to worship him now feel ugly and they had to destroy him
966877630938144768 2018-02-22 03:29:25 UTC <lurie_john> If they give teachers guns, then all the students have to have guns or the teacher has to stand in the corner with the gun stuck to their nose. It is in the fucking Constitution
966877231598522368 2018-02-22 03:27:50 UTC <lurie_john> @Maxtropolitan posting my address and death threats to boot 2nd Amendment has no room for humor
966876610581417985 2018-02-22 03:25:22 UTC <lurie_john> @Jake_Vig @Sarcasticsapien real. what am I waiting for?

966871415344463872 2018-02-22 03:04:43 UTC <lurie_john> @Jake_Vig oh - no, he was excellent but at the end of the day, he would always insist on telling one horrendous joke, like Rupert Pupkin

966410876545675269 2018-02-21 20:34:42 UTC <lurie_john> Is it wrong to call them kids? They are amazing. I promise to never scream at them to get off my lawn again. signed John the curmudgeon

965306712260579329 2018-02-18 19:27:09 UTC <lurie_john> If they really decide to arm teachers, then the teachers should also wear Viking helmets. Because that makes the same amount of sense.

964366402088878080 2018-02-15 05:10:41 UTC <lurie_john> Next time someone clings to the 2nd Amendment as an excuse for this insanity, if the constitution is so important to them, ask them what the 3rd Amendment is.
964364746370646016 2018-02-15 05:04:07 UTC <lurie_john> The 2nd Amendment is obsolete

964222616742563840 2018-02-15 19:39:20 UTC <lurie_john> @bourgeoisalien @socialkosplay The 2nd Amendment was written by a fledgling government to protect human rights against tyranny. So theoretically one should be allowed to own nuclear weapons and tanks, if the 2nd Amendment were not now obsolete. That said, I am excited to paint my tank.
964210488069500928 2018-02-15 18:51:09 UTC <lurie_john> @BoAndersonLaw once they take away your nuclear bomb, who knows what they will take away next. you need your nuclear bomb for hunting to feed your family
964209642455707648 2018-02-15 18:47:47 UTC <lurie_john> In the argument to maintain the legality of AR- 15s, one could replace "AR-15s" with "nuclear bomb" and the argument would only be slightly less logical.

962125879387226112 2018-02-09 00:47:39 UTC <lurie_john> @prisonforkids you certainly have to be in it to win it
962120344055070721 2018-02-09 00:25:40 UTC <lurie_john> @bourgeoisalien they are the same person as far as I can see
962118258374709249 2018-02-09 00:17:22 UTC <lurie_john> @bourgeoisalien the Michel Hillary Moores
962116337580544008 2018-02-09 00:09:44 UTC <lurie_john> @bourgeoisalien but "asshole" doesn't really capture the danger of someone like this. Sorry I didnt do better

962050611339452416 2018-02-09 19:48:34 UTC <lurie_john> @marcus_noland I certainly didn't Maybe I should make a International Marvin Pontiac Day
962037238929416193 2018-02-09 18:55:26 UTC <lurie_john> @feezy33 I never really saw him play  - seems like barely anyone did.
962034132267106304 2018-02-09 18:43:05 UTC <lurie_john> I hope all the gay athletes from everywhere win gold medals  and Pence's head melts. Will be like Hitler watching Jesse Owens.
962033085297524737 2018-02-09 18:38:55 UTC <lurie_john> In 2015, February 9th was National Pancake Day. Now it is #NationalPizzaDay. What the fuck is going on? Is no one but me paying attention? Are these days brought to us by the makers of insulin?
961856770036543490 2018-02-08 06:58:19 UTC <lurie_john> @xiankiefer One mustn't
961856447331016705 2018-02-08 06:57:02 UTC <lurie_john> @xiankiefer I don't know. My broom is my life.
961854966569644032 2018-02-08 06:51:09 UTC <lurie_john> But I will say that they told me to go to the wrong airport and I think this was intentional

961693573346414593 2018-02-08 20:09:49 UTC <lurie_john> What Cavs did in 45 minutes is kind of like Walter White killing all those people in prison at the same time.
961686659468181504 2018-02-08 19:42:21 UTC <lurie_john> @KevinKleps I have this apocalyptical image of dumpsters full of discarded bobblehead dolls
961683112001449984 2018-02-08 19:28:15 UTC <lurie_john> @benwizner and I didn't mean in a movie. I meant that Trump actually met with Paul Sorvino but didn't realize it.
961682091778899968 2018-02-08 19:24:12 UTC <lurie_john> @benwizner fair enough, but Sorvino already played Kissinger, so he has some experience
961681033186938880 2018-02-08 19:20:00 UTC <lurie_john> At the meeting with Trump today, Henry Kissinger was played by Paul Sorvino.

961676426780069888 2018-02-08 19:01:41 UTC <lurie_john> Not to be outdone by Dan Gilbert, Trump is meeting with Henry Kissinger.

961404948004114432 2018-02-07 01:02:56 UTC <lurie_john> U2 has announced that the Quincy Jones interview is untrue and that they were never any good.
961373458029580288 2018-02-07 22:57:48 UTC <lurie_john> Has anyone actually heard Quincy Jones play the trumpet? Or is it always Clark Terry?
961370415837929472 2018-02-07 22:45:43 UTC <lurie_john> @DanielJTurnbull I saw Ringo play live once, even the Shaggs wouldn't have hired him. But he added a humanity to that band that cannot be overlooked.
961370123859910656 2018-02-07 22:44:33 UTC <lurie_john> @milanf86 Episodes - could be the whole season
961369795676524544 2018-02-07 22:43:15 UTC <lurie_john> @junkyardmessiah @GeoffreyArend you are clearly speaking from a lack of experience - that is the last last place
961369498140971013 2018-02-07 22:42:04 UTC <lurie_john> @DragonAndTheFox you obviously do not know me
961359243596136448 2018-02-07 22:01:19 UTC <lurie_john> @canicallucandy man, I would have had to dated Jackie O to compete with him
961359004994711552 2018-02-07 22:00:22 UTC <lurie_john> @DanielJTurnbull and McCartney's bass playing.
961355912450633728 2018-02-07 21:48:05 UTC <lurie_john> I don't think I could hang out with Quincy Jones. I think we might argue.
961349803132190726 2018-02-07 21:23:48 UTC <lurie_john> @pattonoswalt should've wore the cowboy outfit - would've been out before lunch
961349516132782080 2018-02-07 21:22:40 UTC <lurie_john> @KellyScaletta I would like to see that. Unless you mean he goes to the Eagles to play tight end because he is such a ring chaser.
961344107733049344 2018-02-07 21:01:10 UTC <lurie_john> @davidsirota I hope so too. I have a ton of respect for you.
961342424164589568 2018-02-07 20:54:29 UTC <lurie_john> @JeffCoffinMusic Jeff - sent you a DM
961309918946054145 2018-02-07 18:45:19 UTC <lurie_john> @CultofNewMedia how does someone play like Ringo and then tear it up?
961309090327736321 2018-02-07 18:42:02 UTC <lurie_john> @KaviMontanaro he was astounding - just making a joke have deleted it
961305505686843393 2018-02-07 18:27:47 UTC <lurie_john> The most outrageous thing in the Quincy Jones interview is that he thinks Pisces is a good sign.
961304508583284738 2018-02-07 18:23:49 UTC <lurie_john> certainly is true for me
961303946668249089 2018-02-07 18:21:35 UTC <lurie_john> @MJanovic well, Quincy says Brando would fuck anything -  probably is true - just sets up such a weird image
961301129157103617 2018-02-07 18:10:23 UTC <lurie_john> @bozodeluxe It was still Network TV -   So "Arrive at the studio 19 hours before sound check." "Wait here." "No you can't do that."
961300221660721152 2018-02-07 18:06:47 UTC <lurie_john> @Violetkim misquoted would be more likely.

952560271062691840 2018-01-14 15:17:20 UTC <lurie_john> @schmutzie well there you go

952454336298315777 2018-01-14 08:16:24 UTC <lurie_john> When I get depressed I fail to look at the bright side  like - at least the Christmas music has stopped
952452748489916417 2018-01-14 08:10:05 UTC <lurie_john> @jfreewright I just mailed him some amphetamines to get things going
952452563177177088 2018-01-14 08:09:21 UTC <lurie_john> @joshgondelman are you still at the airport?

952447502757875713 2018-01-13 07:49:14 UTC <lurie_john> @JoeLeydon I think it will make me more depressed  going to pass for now
952447289175560192 2018-01-13 07:48:24 UTC <lurie_john> @biloon but a left hook, if aimed right at the button on the jaw - can be very effective  you'll be fine
952446880226652160 2018-01-13 07:46:46 UTC <lurie_john> @JoeLeydon no, sounds like hell  is it good?
952446551993012224 2018-01-13 07:45:28 UTC <lurie_john> @sm_osment ahhh - that made me happy
952445459255226368 2018-01-13 07:41:07 UTC <lurie_john> @JoeLeydon I am finding that people are too conveniently blaming Trump for everything  - where in fact the bullshit is coming from many directions
952444312201121792 2018-01-13 07:36:34 UTC <lurie_john> I am fucking losing my mind. How is everyone else doing?

952415680749625344 2018-01-13 05:42:47 UTC <lurie_john> @madaecnerwal I am aware of this
952414103582269441 2018-01-13 05:36:31 UTC <lurie_john> humor is more important than who is president.  the president when Mark Twain was at his peak was Benjamin Harrison -  Who the fuck was Benjamin Harrison?
952413465829957633 2018-01-13 05:33:59 UTC <lurie_john> @tylerobrown missed that
952412871589269504 2018-01-13 05:31:38 UTC <lurie_john> I just watched SNL for one minute and have come away with the firm conclusion that Lorne Michaels is worse for the world than Trump

952341131861397505 2018-01-13 00:46:34 UTC <lurie_john> I visited the Obeah Woman and drank gallons of goat blood to thwart a Patriots' victory. I hope the people of Tennessee  appreciate what I have done.

952284007106039808 2018-01-13 20:59:34 UTC <lurie_john> @ReelQuinn "Sorry" really doesn't cover it. That is the third time this month.

951995679500578817 2018-01-12 01:53:51 UTC <lurie_john> @chrissteinplays "I wish if they were going to reenact my routine, they wouldn't ruin it."
951992345305677825 2018-01-12 01:40:36 UTC <lurie_john> @Rschooley let them do a "profile" on your "life and work"  - Trump being president is better than what that leads to
951990442555531264 2018-01-12 01:33:03 UTC <lurie_john> @Rschooley seriously - they are as smug, privileged and unaccountable as the person they are attempting to ridicule
951989556261384192 2018-01-12 01:29:31 UTC <lurie_john> @Rschooley fuck them - they are worth nothing
951987679507427328 2018-01-12 01:22:04 UTC <lurie_john> Eric Dolphy means pretty much everything to me. You want to Make America Great Again? Figure out a way to get back to this.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQZ1c3ixoa4
951978312770998273 2018-01-12 00:44:51 UTC <lurie_john> I have invented a phone for our times and suspect I will be quite rich. The iBabble! This phone is only the lower half of most phones - where one can talk and talk but never has to listen because there is no listening device on the phone. The iBabble!
951940981112307712 2018-01-12 22:16:30 UTC <lurie_john> @Instant_Waves that is absolutely not how I want to spend my time
951934602658004992 2018-01-12 21:51:10 UTC <lurie_john> @doloresquintana @bybowes yes, thank you so much, it is my choice - you are so reasonable to allow me this freedom
951933884752695296 2018-01-12 21:48:18 UTC <lurie_john> @doloresquintana I know  I love his work
951931282522628101 2018-01-12 21:37:58 UTC <lurie_john> @ronportnoir great actor - I am sure he will pull it off
951927881449529344 2018-01-12 21:24:27 UTC <lurie_john> Quentin cast Dicaprio to play Manson?  He couldnt cast Vince Gallo because they would have killed each other - then who would play Quentin and Vince in that movie?
951922721805434881 2018-01-12 21:03:57 UTC <lurie_john> @Ms_Apprehension "trestle" was a nice touch
951902385428889600 2018-01-12 19:43:08 UTC <lurie_john> @OneWordLong was reading a bunch of things quickly -   sorry again
951900013688512512 2018-01-12 19:33:43 UTC <lurie_john> @OneWordLong my apologies - I misread that and blocked you have unblocked you  - sorry about that
951898330220630016 2018-01-12 19:27:01 UTC <lurie_john> @sheehan_cc In Cleveland she is best known as Tomi Football
951898170866454528 2018-01-12 19:26:24 UTC <lurie_john> @j_m_wood aww - is that John Hurt? Don't do that to John Hurt
951897381339062273 2018-01-12 19:23:15 UTC <lurie_john> I was raised to understand that racism is a horrific thing only practiced by extremely ignorant people.  Can we drive these roaches back under their rocks?
951896365663248385 2018-01-12 19:19:13 UTC <lurie_john> I don't know who Tomi Lahren is. From what little I have learned today, I don't want to know who Tomi Lahren is or what she thinks about anything.
951895461610352641 2018-01-12 19:15:38 UTC <lurie_john> @weirdgeometry maybe "odd" was a little mild
951895030746308608 2018-01-12 19:13:55 UTC <lurie_john> @weirdgeometry It is very odd that they have transformed Jesus' message to - Hate everyone not exactly like you  - when it was quite the opposite
951892083438125058 2018-01-12 19:02:12 UTC <lurie_john> I was worried about how this President would affect kids. But every kid I know, even as young as 8, just shakes their head and says, "He's an idiot."
951876333747036160 2018-01-12 17:59:37 UTC <lurie_john> @RealSardonicus Didn't know Kitch went back that far

951645240150183936 2018-01-11 02:41:20 UTC <lurie_john> How on earth is "Shithole." not trending?
951644255365287936 2018-01-11 02:37:25 UTC <lurie_john> @mattytalks @mirahwood that is not what it says - you just want to send Matty nudes

951639023046610944 2018-01-11 02:16:38 UTC <lurie_john> @jessehawken no! I missed it?  Oh  - my depression has multiplied
951638464407179264 2018-01-11 02:14:25 UTC <lurie_john> @mattytalks you are a good person

951636712161267713 2018-01-11 02:07:27 UTC <lurie_john> I want to hear Bernie Sanders say Shithole I want it badly  Bernie say Shithole Bernie!!!! say it
951636095107764225 2018-01-11 02:05:00 UTC <lurie_john> CNN is like the Lenny Bruce censorship trial  - He said "shithole?" "Yes, he said "shithole." "He can't say "shithole." We can't say "shithole." "Can we now say "shithole?" "I'm not sure. Shithole." "Sorry, didn't mean to call you a Shithole, but you kind of are, Shithole."
951634127987658752 2018-01-11 01:57:11 UTC <lurie_john> @kelly_carlin that is so wrong - then they say "outhouse" unless they are upset
951633833421623296 2018-01-11 01:56:01 UTC <lurie_john> @mtsw Bus Station Worcester Massachusetts 1970

951622919020597251 2018-01-11 01:12:38 UTC <lurie_john> @vincentdonofrio I am ready
951621300384083968 2018-01-11 01:06:12 UTC <lurie_john> @vincentdonofrio but the stats aren't legit  If you go 3 for 3 - those are your stats. If you perform horribly in a ridiculous movie but every idiot loves it - you went 3 for 3 - but you really didn't  Hope this has been helpful
951620189052985344 2018-01-11 01:01:47 UTC <lurie_john> Dear people of Haiti and Africa - I am not apologizing to you. We have to live with this asshole.
951592552108523521 2018-01-11 23:11:58 UTC <lurie_john> @thing_that_is yes - it was a momentary thing
951587365834903552 2018-01-11 22:51:22 UTC <lurie_john> @SydniDeveraux I would like to order several of those - do you deliver?
951583361977540608 2018-01-11 22:35:27 UTC <lurie_john> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump What constitutes "Illegal immigration?"  Is this the land of your forefathers? No, that would be the Native American. You set fire to their land at Standing Rock. Before you run from the White House, naked, screaming - I'm an asshole and everyone finds me ridiculous -     resign.
951582151337824257 2018-01-11 22:30:39 UTC <lurie_john> @sheehan_cc @revRecluse look at his eyes!!!! Don't draft him!!!!!!!
951581366310883334 2018-01-11 22:27:31 UTC <lurie_john> @sheehan_cc oh  - I just wasted almost 2 seconds on this - I hope the Browns draft Sam Darnold - sorry @revRecluse
951576933267132416 2018-01-11 22:09:54 UTC <lurie_john> @saraconway that is exactly what I did
951576130762543104 2018-01-11 22:06:43 UTC <lurie_john> @saraconway that certainly is not what they told me
951575482490859523 2018-01-11 22:04:09 UTC <lurie_john> @BradFarberman sure! let me explain that on Twitter in 280 characters!

950080980601143296 2018-01-07 19:05:32 UTC <lurie_john> @ru12xu But Jake Tapper is supposed to be a journalist and he was behaving as a partisan shill

950076501860417536 2018-01-07 18:47:44 UTC <lurie_john> @RoachChauncey I dont and cant actually side with Stephen Miller - it is not what I said  have deleted the tweet as I dont want to deal with misreading
950075574155964416 2018-01-07 18:44:03 UTC <lurie_john> @Ieewarren how is this comment worth anyone's time?
950075351161589760 2018-01-07 18:43:09 UTC <lurie_john> @ru12xu I dont know where there was a journalist here - Tapper clearly had his own agenda as did Miller, and Tapper was correctly pointed out as being snide, early on.

946081167840858113 2017-12-27 18:11:42 UTC <lurie_john> @RhondaWinter I appreciate the compliment but James Baldwin - that is too much of a compliment
946080942937997312 2017-12-27 18:10:48 UTC <lurie_john> @facebook @BanPourZan I like that. You should invite me next year. I will sit there quietly.
946080634560184327 2017-12-27 18:09:35 UTC <lurie_john> @RhondaWinter man, I love James Baldwin and it's true I am more amazed by him now

I told him after the concert. He said 'yeah, I just saw this documentary by Ken Burns." Then we laughed and laughed

945670303010705408 2017-12-26 14:59:04 UTC <lurie_john> @sheehan_cc @CapitolW65th this is getting confusing
945665055080767489 2017-12-26 14:38:13 UTC <lurie_john> In 2017, 8 times more Americans were killed by lawnmowers than Muslim extremists. Trump fears antagonizing the Lawnmower Community for fear what they might do to his hair.
945648497180725249 2017-12-26 13:32:25 UTC <lurie_john> In 2017, twice as many Americans were killed by armed toddlers than Muslim extremists. Trump refuses to ban toddlers because of his psychological affinity.

945375624088227840 2017-12-25 19:28:07 UTC <lurie_john> Trump is taking credit for people saying "Merry Christmas." If you had a 4 year old child who behaved like this, you would be concerned.

945031569906991105 2017-12-24 20:40:58 UTC <lurie_john> @joelmgarland I think a movie about your dream role where you fantasize about playing Butterbean and then Fatty Arbuckle

945024232882429952 2017-12-24 20:11:49 UTC <lurie_john> @joelmgarland Butterbean or Arbuckle?

944966329500651523 2017-12-24 16:21:44 UTC <lurie_john> @joelmgarland Fatty Arbuckle is an amazing story. I see an Oscar.
944965030164025344 2017-12-24 16:16:34 UTC <lurie_john> @joelmgarland you could always do the Fatty Arbuckle story
944944987980095490 2017-12-24 14:56:56 UTC <lurie_john> @CathalORiada seems pretty much the same principal - if you are good you get presents

944927311362756608 2017-12-24 13:46:41 UTC <lurie_john> @Skate23r that wasnt meant to be unkind - but part of the joke was Hitchcock didn't direct it.
944926910328565760 2017-12-24 13:45:05 UTC <lurie_john> @jerryn13 yeah, is in the same ballpark

944926016463605760 2017-12-24 13:41:32 UTC <lurie_john> Who came up w the idea of telling kids that a  jolly, magical man in a red suit and white beard was going to come down the chimney with presents for them - so that 2 or 3 years later they would have to break their hearts and say it was all a lie?
944924883137515520 2017-12-24 13:37:02 UTC <lurie_john> I don't see any connection between Santa Claus and the birth of Jesus. This holiday doesn't make any sense.

921739594630131712 2017-10-21 14:06:59 UTC <lurie_john> @realDonaldTrump I didn't know you were president. That is so cool.

921633079034351616 2017-10-21 07:03:43 UTC <lurie_john> @Noahklop13 thanks, I think "unannoying" should be a word. And you were not born annoying and seem young enough to change your ways.
921632865141624833 2017-10-21 07:02:52 UTC <lurie_john> @IndieWire @KenBurns @Screendaily @studioexec1 I read it was going to be called - Look at my hands! You like my hands! Everyone likes my hands!

921629716515377152 2017-10-20 06:50:22 UTC <lurie_john> @Noahklop13 I suggest an unannoying Noah Kloster. I suspect, no one will recognize you. Did you know unannoying was not a word? Can you fix that?

920082072387162113 2017-10-16 00:20:35 UTC <lurie_john> @Rob_Hoffman hope so, anyway
920081946876743680 2017-10-16 00:20:05 UTC <lurie_john> @Rob_Hoffman I think he will figure it out
920080543227744256 2017-10-16 00:14:30 UTC <lurie_john> Not breaking news -  Aaron Judge cannot hit a curve, low and away.

919737179487825920 2017-10-15 01:30:06 UTC <lurie_john> @cosmicprimitive but it certainly puts for the idea that war must be avoided at all costs -  they should make Trump watch it like in Clockwork Orange
919736995366260736 2017-10-15 01:29:22 UTC <lurie_john> @cosmicprimitive there really is some great stuff - and the confusion of it all  how impossible it must have been to be president
919736630679932929 2017-10-15 01:27:55 UTC <lurie_john> @cosmicprimitive of course there are going to be problems and the money comes from  -  well, it comes from where money comes from - but is worth seeing

919371017633615872 2017-10-14 01:15:06 UTC <lurie_john> @jeaniedeeb the way Evan's line goes into a passage from Beethoven's 9th - is really bizarre and dont want to listen, in case it makes it worse
919369154318290944 2017-10-14 01:07:42 UTC <lurie_john> @jeaniedeeb there is a moment in Evan's solo that goes directly into mid Beethoven's 9th - driving me nuts for 9 months nowhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4qr28LU9VQ

919315521656455168 2017-10-14 21:34:35 UTC <lurie_john> Trump is going to start WWlll to distract us from Climate Change.  There is an odd brilliance in his stupidity.

918707015211302912 2017-10-12 05:16:35 UTC <lurie_john> @MiriamMontag it is twitter  people not posting will go unnoticed and if there was ever a time to raise your voice it is now
918706100517535744 2017-10-12 05:12:57 UTC <lurie_john> @zenxv if you want a protest to go by unnoticed -  keeping silence on twitter is the place to do it

918382936956850181 2017-10-12 07:48:49 UTC <lurie_john> @rosemcgowan @danielleiat still - what was that? a stern warning to cool it?
918382725744209920 2017-10-12 07:47:59 UTC <lurie_john> @danielleiat thanks
918381077798023168 2017-10-12 07:41:26 UTC <lurie_john> Twitter suspended Rose McGowan which seems just about as wrong as wrong can be.
918324006796787712 2017-10-11 03:54:39 UTC <lurie_john> @TheAdamGoldberg Ice, then olive oil. Will send you a bill.

918297476041465857 2017-10-11 02:09:14 UTC <lurie_john> @CAuerbachBrown yes, I know. Did you see him pounding on the dugout bannister?

918063962389929985 2017-10-11 10:41:20 UTC <lurie_john> @realDonaldTrump California is having biggest fire in history. 84% of Puerto Rico has no power. Flint STILL does not have clean water  Nice?

918004740998475776 2017-10-10 06:46:00 UTC <lurie_john> @echodanon I remember hearing something creepy about him  but would prefer to not discuss him  - that ok?
918004573217939457 2017-10-10 06:45:20 UTC <lurie_john> @OhNoSheTwitnt certainly less scary than - I wonder if Trump will start a nuclear war to distract us from Climate Change

917995576695971840 2017-10-10 06:09:35 UTC <lurie_john> @apokerplayer have you considered making all the cards aces? Then bad players have an equal chance? And did you know a 4 flush is 38% ?
917995280456470529 2017-10-10 06:08:25 UTC <lurie_john> @apokerplayer Have to find them -    Dear Full Tilt - your site is really exciting! How do you make all those extra aces come?

917990527555063808 2017-10-10 05:49:31 UTC <lurie_john> @kelly_carlin I want to know what happened to the plant in the planter  did it survive? Did Donna Karan blame its death on the plant?
917990269974470656 2017-10-10 05:48:30 UTC <lurie_john> Depressing how much better the wings were than this painting
917990131029692416 2017-10-10 05:47:57 UTC <lurie_john> @apokerplayer but now you do - I know you do  maybe I will play online poker and scream about how rigged it is

917985137446522881 2017-10-10 05:28:06 UTC <lurie_john> I am going to paint for a bit, then have some delicious chicken wings. In case anyone was wondering what I was doing.
917983022544228352 2017-10-10 05:19:42 UTC <lurie_john> @bidibum I am really worried.  Also, did you know "unlove" isn't a word?
917982724698333185 2017-10-10 05:18:31 UTC <lurie_john> I need to know Paddock's motive. I really need to know something
917982566669570048 2017-10-10 05:17:53 UTC <lurie_john> @bidibum why would you unlove me? worried now
917980822908653570 2017-10-10 05:10:58 UTC <lurie_john> @thistallawkgirl not like she was doing some big charity thing - just complaining that she had it
917980655501398016 2017-10-10 05:10:18 UTC <lurie_john> @thistallawkgirl on many Caribbean Islands 70% of the population got it. In some people it doesnt go away - was not mentioned, anywhere, until she got it
917980125899247616 2017-10-10 05:08:11 UTC <lurie_john> @bidibum @msjuliap going to get misunderstood to the end of days
917979521776865280 2017-10-10 05:05:47 UTC <lurie_john> @leasdef nah - have to delete it
917975924271992832 2017-10-10 04:51:30 UTC <lurie_john> @thistallawkgirl I thought she peaked when she drew some attention to Chikungunya

917902990425706496 2017-10-10 00:01:41 UTC <lurie_john> @Gallisart jonauthor - I see you like to hear yourself talk can you do it elsewhere?

917885586966540288 2017-10-10 22:52:32 UTC <lurie_john> If you don't speak out against sexual harassment and racism, don't even pretend to be some kind of artist.
917879129063772160 2017-10-10 22:26:52 UTC <lurie_john> @TheDon_petunia maybe things will change it is too wrong
917858548725485569 2017-10-10 21:05:05 UTC <lurie_john> One thing that seems to have gone unnoticed. US has stopped All Visas from Turkey. Turkey responded by doing the same.

917846591964409856 2017-10-10 20:17:34 UTC <lurie_john> @ccaudleaudio we are all naive - there is no way to get through the day if you arent a little hopefully naive
917845785542262785 2017-10-10 20:14:22 UTC <lurie_john> @khawajaslikeme actually, I was wondering what the reaction would be like if he looked like Gregory Peck.
917843336588873729 2017-10-10 20:04:38 UTC <lurie_john> @ccaudleaudio Jail seems unlikely -   look at the Cosby case, 7000 women could step forward and it doesn't seem to mean much

917837016913588226 2017-10-10 19:39:32 UTC <lurie_john> I'm sorry, but saying "Harvey Weinstein is done" is no different than saying  "Trump is done." They are are same pig with tons of power.
917725785707941888 2017-10-10 12:17:32 UTC <lurie_john> Can everyone please go to the window and yell out                "Mike Ditka is a moron!"  and then we move on to more important things?

915337796633677824 2017-10-03 22:08:31 UTC <lurie_john> @23jubu that seems to be true - but there are also photographs of a note - not sure they are real

914588353034670082 2017-10-01 20:30:30 UTC <lurie_john> @cosmicprimitive this is a reasonable response.  though I wasn't really  looking for reasonable responses.
914587715835920386 2017-10-01 20:27:58 UTC <lurie_john> @OhNoSheTwitnt I think it is when one of their players goes on a murdering spree and they respond by ignoring it.
914587211391172613 2017-10-01 20:25:58 UTC <lurie_john> That Trump has any supporters left at all, puts the Theory of Evolution in serious jeopardy.

914572292520398855 2017-10-01 19:26:41 UTC <lurie_john> @MalcolmNance @RichWielgosz Mayor Cruz is fine  - but the nameless Mayor of San Juan is not
914570585920950273 2017-10-01 19:19:54 UTC <lurie_john> @zenbruin1 no, was actually very difficult to not watch at first but now I am finding it pleasant. I have to say good bye to you now
914562565493149698 2017-10-01 18:48:02 UTC <lurie_john> @zenbruin1 You make an excellent point. I bet you were on your high school debate team.

914314353259794434 2017-09-30 02:21:43 UTC <lurie_john> No! It is really nice to hear from you. I dont get to meet people like you in my daily life.  What facts are you talking about?

914292410917650432 2017-09-30 00:54:32 UTC <lurie_john> @taterpie fair enough - which is why I hesitated to call her Mayor Cruz

914200524093870082 2017-09-30 18:49:24 UTC <lurie_john> @cameronesposito @jeannehospod Mayor Cruz it is
914194623429513216 2017-09-30 18:25:57 UTC <lurie_john> Can we start calling Mayor of San Juan, by her name? Carmen Yulin Cruz. Not difficult to say or remember and she has certainly earned it.
914177380910026753 2017-09-30 17:17:26 UTC <lurie_john> @redmoth76 couldnt agree more
914173783946219520 2017-09-30 17:03:09 UTC <lurie_john> A recent poll shows that 100% of Americans want to slap the idiot, cowardly, racist President.  Poll was conducted in my house, by me, of me

913260276170059776 2017-09-27 04:33:12 UTC <lurie_john> The widely varying views on Hugh Hefner's death in my feed are almost equal to Castro's.  No one else comes close.
913249586709442560 2017-09-27 03:50:43 UTC <lurie_john> Hugh Hefner repeatedly hired Dick Gregory to perform at Playboy clubs when no one else would hire him. Respect
913248644618493952 2017-09-27 03:46:58 UTC <lurie_john> @jeaniedeeb just a joke on the old  phrase and twitter expanding the format - not sad     - not sad at all
913245527315279873 2017-09-27 03:34:35 UTC <lurie_john> 140 characters is how you treat those who can do nothing for you.

913238790956830721 2017-09-27 03:07:49 UTC <lurie_john> @Ididnotdropit because in the immediate experience of my life - I didn't encounter anything like it
913238393068429314 2017-09-27 03:06:14 UTC <lurie_john> @Ididnotdropit I thought things were better and more evolved than they are.  How is this a question one can answer on twitter?
913237858999205888 2017-09-27 03:04:07 UTC <lurie_john> @Independent @SafetyPinDaily and now he can drive in Saudi Arabia

913204305095745536 2017-09-27 00:50:47 UTC <lurie_john> @justkelly_ok @Joker16749 JJ - are you really worth this much time? I am sorry you are hurting. If someone betrays you, it is awful. But what is the point here?
913203616214896641 2017-09-27 00:48:03 UTC <lurie_john> @JonathanLKrohn yes - but are you serious - because timing would be impossible to help anyone
913203053163155457 2017-09-27 00:45:49 UTC <lurie_john> @JonathanLKrohn sure - set it up - I am down
913202611096096768 2017-09-27 00:44:03 UTC <lurie_john> @justkelly_ok @Joker16749 that is what you meant? Kelly and I use our real names - what is your real name - maybe we can get her to come back to you
913201726219485184 2017-09-27 00:40:32 UTC <lurie_john> @justkelly_ok @Joker16749 "to promote (something) with a particular incentive: an incentivized share option scheme."  this is how you meant it?
913200379093020672 2017-09-27 00:35:11 UTC <lurie_john> FUCK THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY  people are dying  #WaivetheJonesAct
913200187455270913 2017-09-27 00:34:25 UTC <lurie_john> @Joker16749 @justkelly_ok fair enough and he makes up words   maybe you should get his number - a real catch
913198336227860480 2017-09-27 00:27:04 UTC <lurie_john> @justkelly_ok @Joker16749 Incentivized is a real word.  On a planet we are unaware of? But why bother Kelly?  Has she upset you somehow?
913197086480445447 2017-09-27 00:22:06 UTC <lurie_john> @justkelly_ok @Joker16749 I love you JJ - you seem like a really good person.
913183453193138176 2017-09-27 23:27:56 UTC <lurie_john> @ez_angus well, if we are in a burning building together, please be prepared that I will not wait for your attempts at humor. Hope that is ok.
913180651700047873 2017-09-27 23:16:48 UTC <lurie_john> @ez_angus I didn't write "repeal"  I wrote "waive" which is the best we can hope for

913168868964782080 2017-09-27 22:29:58 UTC <lurie_john> Breaking News - Things are fucking out of control.
913168577829724160 2017-09-27 22:28:49 UTC <lurie_john> @justkelly_ok "incentivized" wins in my book. I love new words and those who have the courage to invent them
913166296715599874 2017-09-27 22:19:45 UTC <lurie_john> @keithboykin that has been very effective for most of my adult life

912709911745835009 2017-09-26 16:06:14 UTC <lurie_john> @marcus_noland his mother should have just named him The Rifleman right from the start
912709713296527362 2017-09-26 16:05:27 UTC <lurie_john> @marcus_noland damn, he was also drafted into the NFL and won an NBA ring with the Rochester Royals in 1946

912706508374364160 2017-09-26 15:52:43 UTC <lurie_john> Chuck Person and Chuck Connors were both The Rifleman. They were also both named Chuck. What is the plural of Rifleman in this case?
912560729903026176 2017-09-25 06:13:27 UTC <lurie_john> @realDonaldTrump @marrionette2017 sympathy for the president? I am sure you didnt have that a couple of years ago

912447658094157825 2017-09-25 22:44:08 UTC <lurie_john> strange question but no. though why I should answer you is another strange question

912400501651787776 2017-09-25 19:36:45 UTC <lurie_john> @oysterbrine @msjuliap yeah, for sure.
912398962077945857 2017-09-25 19:30:38 UTC <lurie_john> Trump - say to yourself over and over  - "I wish I were  Gregg Popovich. I wish I were Gregg Popovich." It won't work but it's a start.
912396762752671745 2017-09-25 19:21:54 UTC <lurie_john> @oysterbrine I think most people feel as you do.  Which is fair. But somehow it just makes me feel sad.
912390201544192000 2017-09-25 18:55:50 UTC <lurie_john> @LeeHoward57 really? oh man
912389100388446208 2017-09-25 18:51:27 UTC <lurie_john> @ChanceswWolves really smart and tough and fighting for what was good for people  Did you see the doc on him?   I yelled at the TV - You did it again???
912386822789091328 2017-09-25 18:42:24 UTC <lurie_john> I can't help it and I know no one agrees with me - but somehow I feel deeply sorry for Anthony Weiner.  It is such a weird and sad story
912386288254373890 2017-09-25 18:40:17 UTC <lurie_john> @TheTweetOfGod Feeling a little First Testamenty today there?

912375770391171073 2017-09-25 17:58:29 UTC <lurie_john> @JimCorrigan_ I have formed a cabal with separate rules with a membership of one

912374620858265600 2017-09-25 17:53:55 UTC <lurie_john> @jamesosel Abraham Lincoln was Republican
912374502436360192 2017-09-25 17:53:27 UTC <lurie_john> @JimCorrigan_ but they like each other. they love each other. they band together in their bigotry
912374069848395777 2017-09-25 17:51:43 UTC <lurie_john> @lukievan that is kind of what I use now, but is inelegant

912099205988184065 2017-09-24 23:39:31 UTC <lurie_john> @realDonaldTrump Puerto Rico - do you have any idea what it is like there right now? Flint still has no clean water. Snap out of it.

912097491037892614 2017-09-24 23:32:42 UTC <lurie_john> @MonicaLewinsky @AaronWorthing you are allowed to say what you want or think anything is funny that you want - but in this case you made it clear that you are the joke
912059359974305792 2017-09-24 21:01:11 UTC <lurie_john> @Tierno158 @prophecy_187k well, he was the Buddha after all. Kind of his job to be deep.
912055226500337664 2017-09-24 20:44:45 UTC <lurie_john> @AaronWorthing @galassi_w there you go - I ran out of room

912053703926001664 2017-09-24 20:38:42 UTC <lurie_john> @AaronWorthing People who took humor seriously and made the world better place because of it -  Shakespeare, George Carlin, Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor...
912042909997953034 2017-09-24 19:55:49 UTC <lurie_john> @HeatherGreenle2 in all fairness, Cruz only had his hand there because he was holding his pet ferret
912042439137021953 2017-09-24 19:53:57 UTC <lurie_john> @MooksInsight the intention was never - by anyone - to disrespect the troops
912038073193594880 2017-09-24 19:36:36 UTC <lurie_john> @MooksInsight good for him. my politics go entirely in the other direction. but good for him.
912020215961198592 2017-09-24 18:25:38 UTC <lurie_john> @MonicaLewinsky @AaronWorthing you know the most insulting thing here? It isn't funny. You are an insult to people who take humor seriously.
912017916052279297 2017-09-24 18:16:30 UTC <lurie_john> @MonicaLewinsky Monica Lewinsky has OWNED  @AaronWorthing quite gracefully.  Impressed. I can't do that. You're a pathetic jerk Aaron.  Fuck off.

911960696648237056 2017-09-24 14:29:08 UTC <lurie_john> Steve Mnuchin is pretty much a complete asshole, but let's not forget his fine performance in Wizard of Oz.
911959811872485376 2017-09-24 14:25:37 UTC <lurie_john> Chapter 13  - Mutiny on the Bowery, is finished and does not suck.

911815140366065664 2017-09-23 04:50:44 UTC <lurie_john> @thalko "check you out?" You posted several times on my tweet. Your description of yourself shows up.   You are creepy. Really fucking creepy
911814826233618432 2017-09-23 04:49:29 UTC <lurie_john> @yashar @PeteCarroll this is beautiful and I appreciate it. But if anyone should stand with me on IMPEACH EVERYONE UNTIL MARSHAWN LYNCH IS PRESIDENT - it is you.
911810975644491779 2017-09-23 04:34:11 UTC <lurie_john> @PastorDScott Why don't you go on strike Pastor? And keep a vow of silence. For, let's say 20 years? That will work out nicely.
911808949036478465 2017-09-23 04:26:08 UTC <lurie_john> @LibyaLiberty I have chosen Potatoes and do not wish to revisit the poll. Thanks!
911807728657534977 2017-09-23 04:21:17 UTC <lurie_john> @LibyaLiberty I didn't know that was an option. I will also choose that.
911766181970890752 2017-09-23 01:36:12 UTC <lurie_john> @thalko you taught children art? The mind shudders.
911751963410300929 2017-09-23 00:39:42 UTC <lurie_john> I am boycotting the NFL - but if I ever watch another game - I will #TakeAKnee in my home. Fuck you NFL
911745911067414528 2017-09-23 00:15:39 UTC <lurie_john> @icusuezq no eye deer  - is quite far off
911744257928699904 2017-09-23 00:09:05 UTC <lurie_john> @pete11122245 oh Pete - can you not even spell "sissy?"  I will be as nice as I can as I feel sorry for you.
911741736287916032 2017-09-23 23:59:03 UTC <lurie_john> @raesanni my tweets tend to do that
911741281394728961 2017-09-23 23:57:15 UTC <lurie_john> @raesanni I agree with you -  was making a joke I thought was obvious
911737672120635394 2017-09-23 23:42:54 UTC <lurie_john> I think I figured it out  -Twitter is, or can be good. assholes are bad. #TakeAKnee
911737400761704449 2017-09-23 23:41:50 UTC <lurie_john> @yashar @raesanni play fair - talking to Bill Maher is like talking to an arrogant toaster oven - hard to know how to reply
911734629056569344 2017-09-23 23:30:49 UTC <lurie_john> @BuddhaOfCyberia but my book doesnt go nearly that far
911734554007883778 2017-09-23 23:30:31 UTC <lurie_john> @BuddhaOfCyberia It was like that Crumb doc - that I loved. No matter how fucked up you are - just put it out there - we are all human beings
911733771581390849 2017-09-23 23:27:24 UTC <lurie_john> @BuddhaOfCyberia the peeping tom stuff -

911729192991064064 2017-09-23 23:09:13 UTC <lurie_john> @karima919 was a joke - just meant it was difficult  like I scream at the paintings sometimes
911728970248413185 2017-09-23 23:08:20 UTC <lurie_john> @lancegould @ShaunKing He should speak in Alabama more often so we really get a sense of where he stands
911728709224235008 2017-09-23 23:07:18 UTC <lurie_john> Elvin Jones was a ferocious and amazing drummer #TakeAKnee
911727746119864320 2017-09-23 23:03:28 UTC <lurie_john> @karima919 this is a bizarre interpretation of how difficult it is to do something really special. Asso inklings?
911727367667748865 2017-09-23 23:01:58 UTC <lurie_john> @marina_catucci non o capito  I am leading something
911726794767835136 2017-09-23 22:59:41 UTC <lurie_john> @BuddhaOfCyberia oh my god - one of the best ever
911699901347766273 2017-09-23 21:12:49 UTC <lurie_john> @itsaboogin made me laugh
911699624225906688 2017-09-23 21:11:43 UTC <lurie_john> Please keep #TakeAKnee trending. Even if it is just  "Today I had a ham sandwich #TakeAKnee"
911699212957515777 2017-09-23 21:10:05 UTC <lurie_john> @kelly_carlin @BreeNewsome perfect

911698111982194688 2017-09-23 21:05:43 UTC <lurie_john> no, it is about the history of yarn
911698018927304704 2017-09-23 21:05:20 UTC <lurie_john> @fakelawn you have always been a good person in my eyes
911697752052191233 2017-09-23 21:04:17 UTC <lurie_john> @zmzgbzn 2091
911679632629526532 2017-09-23 19:52:17 UTC <lurie_john> @ZzTrujillo you are such a disappointment
911679375145349121 2017-09-23 19:51:15 UTC <lurie_john> @OurHiddenHistry Woody Guthrie can't wait to hate my book.
911679025801723904 2017-09-23 19:49:52 UTC <lurie_john> @gayle_dallas wow -
911676111678980096 2017-09-23 19:38:17 UTC <lurie_john> @gayle_dallas was a joke  - book is good. but writing is nowhere near as soothing as painting
911675941491023872 2017-09-23 19:37:37 UTC <lurie_john> @rkopel almost finished -  ou,t digitally, Nov 1st - something like that
911675544978296832 2017-09-23 19:36:02 UTC <lurie_john> @kelly_carlin I love writing, when it is coming out like music. It is going back and fixing things that makes me wish I was an accountant.
911675193248092160 2017-09-23 19:34:38 UTC <lurie_john> @9EndlessShrimp6 yes, kind of the point
911675128911712256 2017-09-23 19:34:23 UTC <lurie_john> @sheehan_cc I know that from twitter "2+2=4"  "You libtard" " "Racist!" "Don't tell me how to feel!"
911673633130651648 2017-09-23 19:28:26 UTC <lurie_john> @matthewcplowman I am still searching for my inner adult
911673269857800193 2017-09-23 19:27:00 UTC <lurie_john> Writing is fucking hell.  I am hating my book. I hope when I finish it, that you buy it, then we can hate it together.
911671911607881729 2017-09-23 19:21:36 UTC <lurie_john> Amazing the changes in the English language this week  Bum now means Dotard
911670757138337792 2017-09-23 19:17:01 UTC <lurie_john> @PeterCipriani At least Gulen hates the triangle
911667808966205440 2017-09-23 19:05:18 UTC <lurie_john> @angil_55 @robjakrobjak that guy owes me $150.
911667668909985795 2017-09-23 19:04:44 UTC <lurie_john> The most convenient thing about this trade is that Kanter will now be close to Gulen.
911667183872282625 2017-09-23 19:02:49 UTC <lurie_john> Remember Melo when Syracuse won - that kid with the beautiful smile who could play like no one else? I would love to see that back.
911666226623078400 2017-09-23 18:59:01 UTC <lurie_john> Man, I would love for Melo to prove everyone wrong and OKC rips through the league
911600447093387264 2017-09-23 14:37:37 UTC <lurie_john> @realDonaldTrump It is unbecoming of the Great Dotard to sulk like this.
911595759283384321 2017-09-23 14:19:00 UTC <lurie_john> @Mariobatali @KeynesianKlownz aw, were you trying to spell "closet?"  That is so cute.
911591847927173120 2017-09-23 14:03:27 UTC <lurie_john> @LibyaLiberty yuck, stop that
911591670260682753 2017-09-23 14:02:45 UTC <lurie_john> @LibyaLiberty I checked. Took surprisingly little time.  But ok, you were right.
911590680719429632 2017-09-23 13:58:49 UTC <lurie_john> @LibyaLiberty I don't believe you. I am going to check.
911590487370366976 2017-09-23 13:58:03 UTC <lurie_john> There are no "fine" white supremacists  #TakeAKnee
911590163452743680 2017-09-23 13:56:46 UTC <lurie_john> @LibyaLiberty Hend! are you following Donald Trump Jr? Stop that.
911588873540657153 2017-09-23 13:51:38 UTC <lurie_john> We had a great president during the last civil war, this one is the opposite. #TakeAKnee
911583318377934848 2017-09-23 13:29:34 UTC <lurie_john> NFL this weekend is going to be very interesting.  #TakeAKnee
911579075260686337 2017-09-23 13:12:42 UTC <lurie_john> Trump has started a true movement, half the players in the country from high school to NFL would prefer to #TakeAKnee than stand with him.
911366845378199554 2017-09-22 23:09:22 UTC <lurie_john> @StephenKing What? I read Kim Jung-un's statement.  Descended? Trump made Kim Jung- un seem like an elder statesman.
911365213877932040 2017-09-22 23:02:53 UTC <lurie_john> @hodgman I didn't know you considered Sarah Palin a comedy legend but ok.  More importantly, is there an H in Sarah?

911032812907659264 2017-09-21 01:02:03 UTC <lurie_john> Everyone knows what "dotard" means. Kim Jong-un might just be the next James Joyce. Let's pay some attention here.
911030921750618112 2017-09-21 00:54:32 UTC <lurie_john> @PlayDoh @RealRyanMetz you are welcome. I am glad we had this talk. Go forth and do things!

911029802689335296 2017-09-21 00:50:05 UTC <lurie_john> @PlayDoh @RealRyanMetz Ryan - dont call people who are resting "bastards"
911015566357487616 2017-09-21 23:53:31 UTC <lurie_john> you cant be made out of Gumbys
910981529949626368 2017-09-21 21:38:16 UTC <lurie_john> Does it not concern anyone that Mark Zuckerberg appears to be made out of Play Doh?
910950035013210112 2017-09-21 19:33:07 UTC <lurie_john> @piersmorgan what the fuck? do you wake up in the morning and think  - "How can I annoy people today?"

908067101528772608 2017-09-13 20:37:22 UTC <lurie_john> @NylonMag @annetdonahue they could actually play their instruments - by jumping to the "white man" thing is just nuts
908066893839335424 2017-09-13 20:36:33 UTC <lurie_john> @NylonMag @annetdonahue I never watched MTV, my music tastes are very different  - I happened to catch Nirvana on there - was recommended -

908065453356052482 2017-09-13 20:30:49 UTC <lurie_john> @NylonMag @annetdonahue that is a bizarre response -  ugly and uncalled for

908064320902311942 2017-09-13 20:26:19 UTC <lurie_john> @NylonMag @annetdonahue the one truly great thing on there was Nirvana -   what could do that now? no one can play their instruments any more.

907910571617603590 2017-09-13 10:15:23 UTC <lurie_john> @MikeAndMike It isn't fair to the 1916 Giants because they didnt get the chance to continue their streak by Golic's reasoning.
907910316696260609 2017-09-13 10:14:22 UTC <lurie_john> @MikeAndMike If the game was rained out in the 4th inning - then the streak stands. Darkness in 1916 is the same thing.

907307723498369025 2017-09-11 18:19:52 UTC <lurie_john> Day 4 of my NFL boycott -  a little shaky. Eyes are burning and nausea is a problem. Also not sure if I am allowed to watch Sportcenter

906682980873261057 2017-09-09 00:57:22 UTC <lurie_john> @Wolven @MuseZack I am sure it is his "writers" that steal the tweets. Which I dont mind so much - but then, same episode, he boasts he donated $1M to Obama
906662703397326852 2017-09-09 23:36:48 UTC <lurie_john> @KoreGoddess @darrell1965mcd Darrell!   Fantastic to hear from you!
906654119422828544 2017-09-09 23:02:41 UTC <lurie_john> @StephenKing that thing he wrote in the magazine which shall forever remain nameless, about getting hit by a car was some of the best writing I have seen
906653563753041920 2017-09-09 23:00:29 UTC <lurie_john> @StephenKing Is he a Patriots fan? Could be a problem.
906653090803314689 2017-09-09 22:58:36 UTC <lurie_john> @hammer_handle but every time I even see that magazine - I shudder
906646017990434816 2017-09-09 22:30:30 UTC <lurie_john> @Lorcacita @hammer_handle are you really sending me stuff from the New Yorker - they did a lot more horrible things to me than the Trump family
906645820128276485 2017-09-09 22:29:42 UTC <lurie_john> @Lorcacita 20 years ago, I sent him a glass of the restaurant's cheapest wine. So I feel I have done my part.
906627155811033088 2017-09-09 21:15:32 UTC <lurie_john> @FreePennyPress Oh! How are you? Was just about to check in.
906625921599377408 2017-09-09 21:10:38 UTC <lurie_john> Does anyone know that Cuba was sending aid to islands that had been hit by Irma before they got hit? No! Of course not!
906624962429145089 2017-09-09 21:06:49 UTC <lurie_john> Trump extended the Cuba embargo yesterday, of all days. Even Hell will turn this man away when he dies.
906621743489482757 2017-09-09 20:54:02 UTC <lurie_john> @KhaledBeydoun also in their defense, Islamophobes tend to be people of low intelligence and asking them to keep track of things like this isn't fair.
906621273622671361 2017-09-09 20:52:10 UTC <lurie_john> @KhaledBeydoun In their defense, Islamophobia falls under a general ideology of Xenophobia, so they shouldn't have to differentiate.
906620188187127810 2017-09-09 20:47:51 UTC <lurie_john> @robdelaney I hated you for months before the Bus Incident.  Notice that it is capitalized

906384729204805632 2017-09-08 05:12:13 UTC <lurie_john> @_North_Carolina So the state of North Carolina is saying that the people of Cuba don't matter because they are Communists?  I laughed pretty hard - thanks!

906230301092958210 2017-09-08 18:58:35 UTC <lurie_john> @GregoryKinney_ there are giant trucks racing south w supplies - maybe they just thought it was too dangerous

901933216315183104 2017-08-27 22:23:30 UTC <lurie_john> I believe it could be a remarkable tool - but I have always been a little naive
901932855869177856 2017-08-27 22:22:04 UTC <lurie_john> Social media is immensely important and requires heart and responsibility.
901928114330226690 2017-08-27 22:03:14 UTC <lurie_john> @MJanovic @lukievan I am pretty sure I do that
901915760376852480 2017-08-27 21:14:08 UTC <lurie_john> @poe2burm as a former art teacher you should know that sourness lies in the eye of the beholder

901870555867041792 2017-08-27 18:14:31 UTC <lurie_john> @seiwooster @willibro151 thing is  - social media is immensely important  - it can sway public consciousness in wonderful ways.

901868281988034560 2017-08-27 18:05:28 UTC <lurie_john> @seiwooster @willibro151 I studied Buddhism for years. Mindfulness and social media seem to be working at cross purposes - though it is a shame that they do.

900507738379358209 2017-08-23 23:59:10 UTC <lurie_john> @ranchodelaluna Painting there would be great - I painted in oils in Palm Springs and oils that would take a month to dry somewhere else - dried in a day

900447413030223872 2017-08-23 19:59:27 UTC <lurie_john> I knew I was going to have trouble boycotting the NFL -  so I stared at the eclipse. Fuck you NFL.

900269644224897024 2017-08-23 08:13:04 UTC <lurie_john> @mvnza it is ok ariq -   you will be fine - no sea creatures will be near you in your bedroom
900190736016125953 2017-08-22 02:59:30 UTC <lurie_john> @DIY_skeleton I am going to block you now - for good I did the best I could with you sorry you have a problem with me
900190556730642436 2017-08-22 02:58:48 UTC <lurie_john> @DIY_skeleton i am sorry my twitter activity does not meet your approval  one can post something and be repeatedly attacked - it is exhausting
900189401824858112 2017-08-22 02:54:12 UTC <lurie_john> @DIY_skeleton it is disconcerting that you make me defend my sanity in relation to this Uhhhh
900189213043421185 2017-08-22 02:53:27 UTC <lurie_john> @DIY_skeleton insane, alienated men filled w hate  -  I was trying to make this point so we do not invade Afghanistan
900188951369187328 2017-08-22 02:52:25 UTC <lurie_john> @DIY_skeleton one last try - my point was that Roof, Atta, the asshole in Charlottesville, the assholes in Barcelona - are all the same thing -
900187988939943936 2017-08-22 02:48:35 UTC <lurie_john> @DIY_skeleton damn - I unblocked you to give you another chance and this is your response? you must be a real asshole
900187802184364032 2017-08-22 02:47:51 UTC <lurie_john> @DIY_skeleton I think that is clearly true
900187578439282689 2017-08-22 02:46:58 UTC <lurie_john> @DIY_skeleton or what "uhhhh" means here  I block you sorry that makes you think I have lost my mind I have unblocked you  Uhhhhh
900187247655477248 2017-08-22 02:45:39 UTC <lurie_john> @DIY_skeleton If you write " if you're referring to the article that explicitly states this, uhhh"  and I dont know what you are referring to
900187000669712384 2017-08-22 02:44:40 UTC <lurie_john> @DIY_skeleton I try to stay on and block people I find to be a waste of time
900180537947684864 2017-08-22 02:18:59 UTC <lurie_john> @ByrdBrainToo for a few hours i meant
900169790949556224 2017-08-22 01:36:17 UTC <lurie_john> @jdb_jody happening
900168084471808000 2017-08-22 01:29:30 UTC <lurie_john> @lilactree50 no - chapter 11 is playing in paris
900167277932408835 2017-08-22 01:26:18 UTC <lurie_john> @lilactree50 I am on to 11 -   fixed 9 and 10  but this is not that
900167113037500416 2017-08-22 01:25:38 UTC <lurie_john> @realdawnhoward they insist on happy endings - I could only offer a vaguely happy ending
900142229582467072 2017-08-22 23:46:46 UTC <lurie_john> @bullldogg bwhahahaha -   you looked at the eclipse didnt you?
900142015089913857 2017-08-22 23:45:54 UTC <lurie_john> @BrentNYT maybe was the plan all along - because without Bradley - Thomas' defense was going to be exposed
900141762651598848 2017-08-22 23:44:54 UTC <lurie_john> @BrentNYT a while ago
900129410514288643 2017-08-22 22:55:49 UTC <lurie_john> I am trying to learn this. All the time.
900129339169267713 2017-08-22 22:55:32 UTC <lurie_john> You know why I loved Dick Gregory? Because he could be scathingly funny and honest and true but still have love in his heart.
900125589964804096 2017-08-22 22:40:38 UTC <lurie_john> @SubBeck you are not helping my marketing whatsoever
900123105061990401 2017-08-22 22:30:46 UTC <lurie_john> @jaydeflix @JulieLeto really  - what on earth is wrong with you - you are just angry  there is no love or romance in you - you are just angry  freak
900120447827705858 2017-08-22 22:20:12 UTC <lurie_john> @jaydeflix @JulieLeto oy! I said you stood up and made your point. good for you. I have raised a white flag. You want to kick a dead horse? How romantic!
900120168755580928 2017-08-22 22:19:06 UTC <lurie_john> @jaydeflix @JulieLeto yes! this has been said 433 times do you take writing lessons from John Giorno John Giorno?
900117104082464768 2017-08-22 22:06:55 UTC <lurie_john> @sheehan_cc because I should have done that in high school and didnt?
900081700415430658 2017-08-22 19:46:14 UTC <lurie_john> @AndyRichter @astrachanphoto and I got distracted
900081634392903680 2017-08-22 19:45:59 UTC <lurie_john> @AndyRichter @astrachanphoto I was in a movie where Jesus went to attack the money lenders - but then Willem accidentally hit the cameraman in the head w a coin
900079759450939392 2017-08-22 19:38:31 UTC <lurie_john> @thevandykeparks I know many of the best places to swim around the world and try to keep them that way by not telling anyone
900057364145025025 2017-08-22 18:09:32 UTC <lurie_john> @meganf @marybethbass ps - this is as close as I get to a "happy ending" so lets leave it here
900057209064890369 2017-08-22 18:08:55 UTC <lurie_john> @meganf @marybethbass you guys won the argument. No one was being misogynistic but can see how it was taken as such as it usually is meant that way.
900056811511926785 2017-08-22 18:07:20 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @Hooderman @AllAboutRomance fair enough - you have won me over here
900056408741335041 2017-08-22 18:05:44 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @Hooderman @AllAboutRomance I am sure he will get wind of this
900056236195971072 2017-08-22 18:05:03 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @Hooderman @AllAboutRomance a ferocious lot, the romance community.
900054731971801090 2017-08-22 17:59:04 UTC <lurie_john> @meganf @marybethbass I dont think Judd Apatow was being intentionally offensive and I think you guys, for the most part, stood up pretty well
900054393797693441 2017-08-22 17:57:44 UTC <lurie_john> @meganf @marybethbass the happy ending part might be difficult for me
900050945148637184 2017-08-22 17:44:02 UTC <lurie_john> @SirAbsurd that was about George Bush  -   was first gulf war  seems to be a cycle for insecure presidents
900049974058246149 2017-08-22 17:40:10 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @AllAboutRomance @Hooderman actually, to some extent they have won me over here.
900047152579268609 2017-08-22 17:28:57 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass but you could be right. You are obviously on the other end of it and I am not.
900046727142662145 2017-08-22 17:27:16 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass I think what is at the core, is these ridiculous covers one sees in the supermarket and that one author has written 483,8231 books
900046220315570176 2017-08-22 17:25:15 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass @meganf aw, you beat me to it
900044330970337288 2017-08-22 17:17:45 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass @meganf on Dorothy Parker's birthday of all days
900044240398503942 2017-08-22 17:17:23 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass @meganf you know, until an hour ago, I had no idea there was a "romance community." I was joking around until the accusation of misogyny came up
900043326111576064 2017-08-22 17:13:45 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass @meganf I dont think so  -
900042939820376064 2017-08-22 17:12:13 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass I am writing a book. It is hard. No one said it wasnt. You made an accusation of misogyny - which I think stinks
900042606629072898 2017-08-22 17:10:54 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass @meganf a romance novel?
900042544532389888 2017-08-22 17:10:39 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass @meganf there are others claiming it was misogynistic  but in all seriousness - what constitutes a romance novel -  Is sense and sensibility -
900041697828249606 2017-08-22 17:07:17 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass You could make the same argument that what I said was offensive to firemen, it makes absolutely no sense
900040835206705153 2017-08-22 17:03:51 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass the sexism here is all yours
900040754395058176 2017-08-22 17:03:32 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass I never said it would be easy. Nor did I have any idea that romance novels were a field only women were allowed to partake in.
900040323631648768 2017-08-22 17:01:49 UTC <lurie_john> @marybethbass that is really  insane
900036336844931072 2017-08-22 16:45:59 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @laurendane Judd Apatow may have been dismissive there, you are right. I am sure he is rethinking his stance on the subject as we speak.
900035176948019200 2017-08-22 16:41:22 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @laurendane and where did you come up with "lazy?"
900034830645243904 2017-08-22 16:40:00 UTC <lurie_john> @Maxtropolitan @JulieLeto This is one of those important issues, I did not know was going to be discussed today.
900034563023548417 2017-08-22 16:38:56 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @laurendane I honestly think I could write a good romance novel. You think me saying that because I am a man is somehow offensive.
900033688259497985 2017-08-22 16:35:27 UTC <lurie_john> @jak1437 @JulieLeto How does one become a member of the "romance community?"
900033429932265474 2017-08-22 16:34:26 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @saraconway actually my deal with Random House says I cant.  At least not right away.
900033130421260291 2017-08-22 16:33:14 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @laurendane This assumption has nothing to do with what I said. You are looking to be offended.
900031339654553600 2017-08-22 16:26:07 UTC <lurie_john> @JulieLeto @jak1437 Thanks for your support. But you have obviously never seen my dancing.
900030965916983297 2017-08-22 16:24:38 UTC <lurie_john> @meganf I'm serious. I think I could write a good romance novel. Wasn't taking anyone's bait.
900029537727238144 2017-08-22 16:18:58 UTC <lurie_john> @jaydeflix good point
900029285158793218 2017-08-22 16:17:57 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @JulieLeto hero!
900028097617158144 2017-08-22 16:13:14 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @JulieLeto do we have a bet or not? and for how much, this has to be worth my while - once the bet is established, you can ask questions
900024617930289154 2017-08-22 15:59:25 UTC <lurie_john> @Bourdain @SebDes23 I usually stop into warts
900024298479464453 2017-08-22 15:58:09 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow @JulieLeto Yes,  I bet I could

899920438821892096 2017-08-22 09:05:26 UTC <lurie_john> @MooseAllain I hope Ben Kingsley didnt visit and try to drag you back into a life of crime
899920097644511232 2017-08-22 09:04:05 UTC <lurie_john> @MooseAllain I dont work any more - I have started a GoFundme because my president is an idiot and I am sure it will pay off
899919923446677504 2017-08-22 09:03:24 UTC <lurie_john> @MooseAllain I hope spain was nice

899919188134952960 2017-08-22 09:00:28 UTC <lurie_john> @historyinmoment @revRecluse @grrrrekon she looks nothing like Celine Dion -  I worry about you
899918550386835456 2017-08-22 08:57:56 UTC <lurie_john> @MooseAllain you know what is odd w porn bots  - is they seem to have once been normal accounts and now are porn bots
899918056230715392 2017-08-22 08:55:58 UTC <lurie_john> @MooseAllain dear Diana @5WQCRQiwffc8h8T  this is my friend Moose, Moose is shy but a nice fellow
899917711693795328 2017-08-22 08:54:36 UTC <lurie_john> @MooseAllain you block porn bots? I hold them close to my heart
899917453484056576 2017-08-22 08:53:35 UTC <lurie_john> @MooseAllain it is a comprehensive list and a lot of effort went into it.
899917338778238976 2017-08-22 08:53:07 UTC <lurie_john> @MooseAllain actually, does $5 sound fair?
899917239901671424 2017-08-22 08:52:44 UTC <lurie_john> @MooseAllain I could send you my blocked list so you can avoid these unpleasant interactions.
899915906008141825 2017-08-22 08:47:26 UTC <lurie_john> @historyinmoment Everyone knows that is Margaret Thatcher
899915617742016512 2017-08-22 08:46:17 UTC <lurie_john> @historyinmoment that isnt Janis Joplin   you guys just dont give up do you?

899878952038256640 2017-08-21 06:20:35 UTC <lurie_john> @HistoryInPix @DJsilentpartner that is very tall
899878606024912897 2017-08-21 06:19:13 UTC <lurie_john> @HistoryInPix @DJsilentpartner oh - maybe he was
899878415850930176 2017-08-21 06:18:27 UTC <lurie_john> @HistoryInPix @DJsilentpartner no way  - then Robert is 9 feet
899876041992306688 2017-08-21 06:09:01 UTC <lurie_john> @HistoryInPix so unfair to not name the father because he is short
899867365084626944 2017-08-21 05:34:33 UTC <lurie_john> @bdshorizons55 I am just finishing MP the Asylum Years
899865803209748481 2017-08-21 05:28:20 UTC <lurie_john> @JuddApatow I didn't know I had a retirement check coming - but I bet I could write pretty good romance novels
899859734970478593 2017-08-21 05:04:14 UTC <lurie_john> @voraciousbrain you look lovely  PERIOD
899857723143192576 2017-08-21 04:56:14 UTC <lurie_john> @voraciousbrain no, it is the attitude of someone becoming unhinged w anger - but you look lovely - wish we could just leave it there
899856195925757952 2017-08-21 04:50:10 UTC <lurie_john> @voraciousbrain you look extremely lovely and any jerk who made a comment -  I will bite my tongue, my non violence is slipping away
899854970475905024 2017-08-21 04:45:18 UTC <lurie_john> @spencerpratt no, WWlll was already in progress - calling it Afghanistan is that weird human thing of wanting to name things
899853305773518848 2017-08-21 04:38:41 UTC <lurie_john> @voraciousbrain you look lovely

899850688582344706 2017-08-21 04:28:17 UTC <lurie_john> @knufyendor @WernerTwertzog Werner told me 30 years ago that money was going to come to me like fleas to a dog - fuck Werner

899799976896802816 2017-08-21 01:06:46 UTC <lurie_john> @MJanovic hard to sing w hands coming at your throat

899789766941704193 2017-08-21 00:26:12 UTC <lurie_john> @starchaser57 I am neither a Dem or a Christian. Last total solar eclipse was almost 100 years ago -  I believe it is longer since the US bombed anyone
899788776574267392 2017-08-21 00:22:16 UTC <lurie_john> @BrianMcInnis87 that has been clear all along
899788394112454657 2017-08-21 00:20:45 UTC <lurie_john> @starchaser57 you pretend to be serious about Jesus and use a Star Wars reference to make your non point? I feel sorry for you. Almost empathy. Like Jesus
899786545384701952 2017-08-21 00:13:24 UTC <lurie_john> @ru12xu yes! since that Bobby Fischer thing you're right on the money here

899784733223038976 2017-08-21 00:06:12 UTC <lurie_john> @BrianMcInnis87 yes, he is too easy and isnt really the problem - I am sorry my tweet bothered you - I hope not nearly as much as yours bothered me
899782846268755969 2017-08-21 23:58:42 UTC <lurie_john> @KingRhiNOLa that is not journalism - that is propaganda
899782303483867137 2017-08-21 23:56:32 UTC <lurie_john> @djbuckrooster no, but I sat in an audience - 3 times and adored him

899432820287864834 2017-08-20 00:47:49 UTC <lurie_john> @Bourdain @AsiaArgento you stay on the other side of the room and dont drink any alcohol. I dont trust him one bit.
899426443410763778 2017-08-20 00:22:29 UTC <lurie_john> @AsiaArgento @Bourdain oy! she is in NYC at your house? this is all wrong.

899380814345113602 2017-08-20 21:21:10 UTC <lurie_john> @Schwartzesque and there is no N in Macchu Picchu
899380610338258947 2017-08-20 21:20:21 UTC <lurie_john> @Schwartzesque something very unholy about Karl Rove at Macchu Picchu   - I bet Neruda is spinning in his grave
899379758051581952 2017-08-20 21:16:58 UTC <lurie_john> @margotdarby unless you are part of the US government   - then you are immune to any damage

899288950388477954 2017-08-20 15:16:08 UTC <lurie_john> @jessehawken I would do it - but I've had enough attacks for one week
899288856352239616 2017-08-20 15:15:45 UTC <lurie_john> @jessehawken you could tweet to him that as president it is his job to stare into the sky and yell "come back sun!"
899282885089402880 2017-08-20 14:52:02 UTC <lurie_john> @MrsRochesterNY I fear the day we are eventually rid of him. It will be depressingly clear that things are still a complete mess
899252044896370688 2017-08-20 12:49:29 UTC <lurie_john> what you did was courageous and had a strong impact  - there are going to be a few jerks like Terco along the way. sorry
899246732533477380 2017-08-20 12:28:22 UTC <lurie_john> @Wakarraja not ok with me, but you're the only one who can change this
899158494930194432 2017-08-19 06:37:45 UTC <lurie_john> @Probgoblin @Spanish_Radish @Dawn_M_ @RomeshRanga @ParanoiaStory @zmzgbzn please dont do that
899058806306607105 2017-08-19 00:01:37 UTC <lurie_john> @justmyreading when I was his age, attractive older women made me very nervous. So some empathy here would be nice.
899058257062490112 2017-08-19 23:59:26 UTC <lurie_john> @zwizki I am a good person and as it seems to be going overlooked on my own planet -  I am hoping for a wider audience
899057512829288449 2017-08-19 23:56:29 UTC <lurie_john> @markhhsp nuts that me and Dennis and Don Cherry were 10 inches apart and I have no recollection of this moment
899057275175936001 2017-08-19 23:55:32 UTC <lurie_john> @zwizki not at all, I feel bad for us, but was glad to spare the aliens

897606575367565318 2017-08-15 23:50:58 UTC <lurie_john> @PRyan @gank41 yeah! maybe we can get it down to President Orrin Hatch! Then I could set myself on fire outside the White House
897606127361417216 2017-08-15 23:49:12 UTC <lurie_john> @adam_schartoff Is that some AA logic? I dont think it works here We need an actual plan or the greedy ones will always control everything
897605541454913537 2017-08-15 23:46:52 UTC <lurie_john> @RobertWray_ then Ryan then Tillerson, then Orrin Hatch, then whatever hideous corporate democrat - we need a wider plan

897603937028767744 2017-08-15 23:40:29 UTC <lurie_john> @WeltGeist your questions are stupid and offensive - I believe I will not answer them
897603557641383936 2017-08-15 23:38:59 UTC <lurie_john> @doloresquintana Paul Ryan - Tillerson - Orrin Hatch?

896807286647246852 2017-08-13 18:54:53 UTC <lurie_john> @creepypillow the proof is that a Nazi ran over a crowd of innocent people and he then said there were problems w both sides.

894748859796267008 2017-08-07 02:35:26 UTC <lurie_john> Once I went to see @BillFrisell  play. He looked at his set list and said, "All these songs suck."  #hero

893514417584963584 2017-08-04 16:50:12 UTC <lurie_john> I bet if Charles Oakley sat in Bryant Park at game time. More Knicks fans would go to see him than the game. Fuck you Dolan

892908267730554880 2017-08-02 00:41:35 UTC <lurie_john> moral of the story is - only go outside, stay away from the internet. It invites morons into your living room.

892473867071098880 2017-08-01 19:55:25 UTC <lurie_john> This concludes John and Reince Priebus for the time being. Thank you for being part of our trip. WE LOVE ALL OF YOU!
892473287963496449 2017-08-01 19:53:07 UTC <lurie_john> I picked Reince up from the police station. He keeps saying - Tomorrow! Let's hold hands and drive off a cliff! Ok? Can we? Huh?"
892472879429955584 2017-08-01 19:51:30 UTC <lurie_john> @like_who_is_he I feel that very strongly  - thank you for loving me
892472763897741313 2017-08-01 19:51:02 UTC <lurie_john> Now I feel bad that I did that and will go to Police Station and pick him up in a bit.
892472429255241728 2017-08-01 19:49:43 UTC <lurie_john> Police brought Reince back to the room but I said I had no idea who he was.
892469499080867840 2017-08-01 19:38:04 UTC <lurie_john> @CurlyQ42 in the morning we will find one
892469384073138176 2017-08-01 19:37:37 UTC <lurie_john> You are such a sweetheart  - but we have gone to a hotel.  Thanks though
892468051039354880 2017-08-01 19:32:19 UTC <lurie_john> @HugeDumbIdiot not on this one, green butt skunk
892467372656930817 2017-08-01 19:29:37 UTC <lurie_john> Reince has put too many quarters into a chair that vibrates and it threw him right out the window. I will go look for him in a bit.
892467045442490368 2017-08-01 19:28:19 UTC <lurie_john> Reince has only packed his stuffed animals and one pair of underwear.
892466754336718848 2017-08-01 19:27:10 UTC <lurie_john> We are on a tight budget so we will be sharing motel rooms on the trip. We are stopping now though we have been on the road for 18 minutes

892465023083307011 2017-08-01 19:20:17 UTC <lurie_john> We are at the Chuck E Cheese in North Bergin N.J.
892464902853537793 2017-08-01 19:19:48 UTC <lurie_john> I ran into this girl I used to know. If someone could watch Reince for a couple of hours, I would appreciate it.
892463924276232194 2017-08-01 19:15:55 UTC <lurie_john> "Come on, Reince, get back in the car." "Whiiiirrrrrrrrrrrr!"
892463789152628740 2017-08-01 19:15:23 UTC <lurie_john> I found a Chuck E Cheese but Reince ate too much sugar. Now he is running in little circles making a whirring sound.
892463431563038721 2017-08-01 19:13:57 UTC <lurie_john> @FreePennyPress I dont know what that is
892462937742483456 2017-08-01 19:12:00 UTC <lurie_john> I am going take him to Chuck E Cheese if I can find one.
892462733861548034 2017-08-01 19:11:11 UTC <lurie_john> Reince is crying.
892462667096621057 2017-08-01 19:10:55 UTC <lurie_john> Trip has gotten off to a bad start. Car has no air conditioner and Reince brought a sandwich that he sat on by mistake.
892462441757626368 2017-08-01 19:10:01 UTC <lurie_john> I am driving cross country with my pal, Reince Priebus. I will try to report back to you on our trip.

890828278264672256 2017-07-27 06:56:26 UTC <lurie_john> @JohnnySquirtgun no no - all good movies end with all the characters getting run over by a bus.
890828104108843008 2017-07-27 06:55:45 UTC <lurie_john> @FrankJPaladino you could still write it  - I am just thinking out loud here

890757160484966400 2017-07-27 02:13:51 UTC <lurie_john> Yes, thank you. I'm sorry if this question seems too personal, but are you a porn bot? https://twitter.com/andrasirobert/status/890756307443212290

890726303036526592 2017-07-27 00:11:14 UTC <lurie_john> @KymLang dont call me dude and dont tell me what I need to watch - otherwise your tweet is perfect!

890714818352730113 2017-07-27 23:25:36 UTC <lurie_john> If you plant a seed in the ground and then a little green sprig sprouts up through the dirt, it gives one an overwhelming sense of optimism.
890706723052408832 2017-07-27 22:53:25 UTC <lurie_john> @WJB219 nah - either way
890689107160174592 2017-07-27 21:43:26 UTC <lurie_john> @WJB219 I have been on here long enough to know which tweets will bring a basket of annoying responses.
890685842993401856 2017-07-27 21:30:27 UTC <lurie_john> @RexHuppke @Rschooley @Home_Halfway He hires someone for that

890682379416850433 2017-07-27 21:16:41 UTC <lurie_john> @VinnieTesla I am still being nice. But realized two hours of responding would be a bit much
890681394451668993 2017-07-27 21:12:47 UTC <lurie_john> @joewilsontv Hello Joe!  But we can skip the formalities.

890677134246633472 2017-07-27 20:55:51 UTC <lurie_john> @zazaza1346 such a coincidence, I am currently reading a tweet that is not yours
890676908647563264 2017-07-27 20:54:57 UTC <lurie_john> @CoveRoadKiller an editor would spot that kind of thing
890676682792632324 2017-07-27 20:54:03 UTC <lurie_john> @RealSardonicus you know how long it would take to paint that fur? forget it
890675711337316352 2017-07-27 20:50:12 UTC <lurie_john> I find twitter can be a wonderful place once you have blocked 2 or 3 million people.

888969790009868288 2017-07-22 03:51:28 UTC <lurie_john> @PattyArquette so President Paul Ryan? I will be under my bed if you need me
888968232006279168 2017-07-22 03:45:17 UTC <lurie_john> Screaming to impeach which means President Pence. Is like screaming for the elevator to go up one floor and walking into empty shaft.
888963078141988864 2017-07-22 03:24:48 UTC <lurie_john> @pildash I saw him live - incredible  bursting through it

888959909408243713 2017-07-22 03:12:13 UTC <lurie_john> @pildash @CrustyLurie your desire for public recognition is disconcerting  I hope you find a path in your life
888958591801184256 2017-07-22 03:06:58 UTC <lurie_john> @pildash @CrustyLurie the only thing I can do at this point is feel sorry for you. I am not trying to be a jerk. Just a bit of sanity
888937784114905089 2017-07-22 01:44:18 UTC <lurie_john> @CrustyLurie great account - excellent way to spend your time sorry for you
888933880505536514 2017-07-22 01:28:47 UTC <lurie_john> @pistolthetort my name is John Lurie. That is my photo I have 20,000 time more followers than you - who does not post his real name or photo.
888933479336914945 2017-07-22 01:27:11 UTC <lurie_john> @pistolthetort see - if I do - or have conveyed that   - I am not sure how. Can you give an example?
888933093125632000 2017-07-22 01:25:39 UTC <lurie_john> @sillytiki @pistolthetort not a conundrum at all - if people expect to be treated with respect, they should treat you w respect - fame has nothing to do w it
888932416789909505 2017-07-22 01:22:58 UTC <lurie_john> @TWWKfilm @pildash Benny Golson -    listen to that
888930760203407361 2017-07-22 01:16:23 UTC <lurie_john> @sillytiki this I felt was rude and selfish and a waste of my time I have no choice but to block you
888930582960451585 2017-07-22 01:15:41 UTC <lurie_john> @sillytiki am I asking your advice?  I tried to answer your question - then you asked another - when you could have looked it up
888930010853199872 2017-07-22 01:13:24 UTC <lurie_john> @sillytiki not trying to be rude - just exhausted with this stuff - I feel you were rude - but you will never see that
888926074272350209 2017-07-22 00:57:46 UTC <lurie_john> @TWWKfilm oh - this is the only time I did this in my life - we stole Earl Bostic's version
888925884916404224 2017-07-22 00:57:01 UTC <lurie_john> @sillytiki look it up - this may come as a surprise to you but I am not Google.

888918732340424705 2017-07-22 00:28:35 UTC <lurie_john> @nathantyree just that I am on the edge of leaving here due to cringing
888917655251550209 2017-07-22 00:24:18 UTC <lurie_john> @nathantyree what about if you are just not a waste of time?
888917513874145281 2017-07-22 00:23:45 UTC <lurie_john> @wool_oo1 @m_yosry2012 Why must I be like that? Why must I chase the cat? Talking about the dolphin in me.

888580531192971265 2017-07-21 02:04:42 UTC <lurie_john> he went to watch Ball like he is scouting him
888573055160791040 2017-07-21 01:34:59 UTC <lurie_john> were Kyrie's words on tape? I have a feeling it is just Dan Gilbert is creepy and I want to get out of here

888519098619109376 2017-07-21 22:00:35 UTC <lurie_john> @sheehan_cc Cavs dont have to trade w Knicks. They usually get their players for free

888496950483587072 2017-07-21 20:32:35 UTC <lurie_john> @KellyScaletta Knicks signed Spicer to play at shooting guard but have released him and now he wears a Cavs uniform.
888495444795564032 2017-07-21 20:26:36 UTC <lurie_john> @KellyScaletta Carlissimo? I could see that
888494947212697600 2017-07-21 20:24:37 UTC <lurie_john> @p0tim I would assume so but whether it is granted or not is not guaranteed. Actually I dont know at all. Am curious.
888437698276491265 2017-07-21 16:37:08 UTC <lurie_john> Knicks have signed Sean Spicer
888422383970856960 2017-07-21 15:36:17 UTC <lurie_john> I hope Canada lets the 2 Burundi kids stay and the other 4 get away safely.

888233820247515136 2017-07-20 03:06:59 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus this isn't correct? Who works for Pope Francis?  Who irons his robes?

888230498887233541 2017-07-20 02:53:48 UTC <lurie_john> If I didn't have twitter, I wouldn't know there were people named Hugh Freeze and Houston Nutt.

887808857812213760 2017-07-19 22:58:21 UTC <lurie_john> @rockemstock its a horrendous rule which allows them to persecute anyone they want to  -  since it is OJ - no one cares but i had no idea this was a rule
887808238053457921 2017-07-19 22:55:53 UTC <lurie_john> @FearNloathing79 @juliaamccurdy i am getting tired of twitter

887806302583492614 2017-07-19 22:48:11 UTC <lurie_john> @rockemstock that is not what I read happened but that is a different thing entirely
887805364527407105 2017-07-19 22:44:28 UTC <lurie_john> @FearNloathing79 yes! all the difficulties of putting a TV show together would just vanish if people were to let me know good places to fish

887708409700773888 2017-07-19 16:19:12 UTC <lurie_john> @ArthurNares no paddle. the constitution does not mention a paddle
887706735208800257 2017-07-19 16:12:33 UTC <lurie_john> An overlooked part of the constitution -  If the sitting president proves to be a complete idiot, he may be sent out to sea in a small boat.
887705974693408768 2017-07-19 16:09:31 UTC <lurie_john> Today, like most days, I woke up thinking  - I don't want to know what David Brooks thinks, about anything.

887250367830003712 2017-07-18 09:59:06 UTC <lurie_john> I wonder if I have just revealed something horrendous about myself.
887249845920157696 2017-07-18 09:57:02 UTC <lurie_john> I woke up from a dream where a woman was telling me "The towel is vandalism." I don't think this is in any dream interpretation books.

886254279153127428 2017-07-15 16:01:00 UTC <lurie_john> It is Saturday morning in the middle of July. Trump is president. It makes every day feel strange and uncertain.  A poem before coffee.

886059919102836738 2017-07-14 03:08:41 UTC <lurie_john> @petersarsgaard I'm sorry. I don't think that was his intent.
885917010424729602 2017-07-14 17:40:49 UTC <lurie_john> "I would like to meet the man they call Trump. Bring him to me." Madame  Defarge
885688162181410816 2017-07-13 02:31:27 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus @BenjaminDegnan no, then there would be a clear trail of where he stole his tweets from
885684713788243968 2017-07-13 02:17:45 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus not sure how limbo works - maybe he will cut ahead of me
885684501552259073 2017-07-13 02:16:55 UTC <lurie_john> @Diane_7A Diane  - cut it out
885684285340086272 2017-07-13 02:16:03 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus plus Billy died in 1988  - if he's there he is there
885683917671600128 2017-07-13 02:14:35 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus I trust your information on many things - not this
885681428889051136 2017-07-13 02:04:42 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus you just blocked me from heaven - what bigger line are you looking for?
885680804323614720 2017-07-13 02:02:13 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus I am going to get you for this
885676102609403904 2017-07-13 01:43:32 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus If you were Saint Peter   - you would take Billy Carter over me? Oh Alan.
885675672198410240 2017-07-13 01:41:49 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus I would be so much easier to get in

885600021445529600 2017-07-13 20:41:13 UTC <lurie_john> @ChuckModi1 maybe I have invented a past for journalism that doesn't really exist, but it is heart breaking what is happening now
885597944279429120 2017-07-13 20:32:58 UTC <lurie_john> @ChuckModi1 telling uncomfortable truths and integrity kill careers in most fields

885578936566075395 2017-07-13 19:17:26 UTC <lurie_john> When Jimmy Carter passes, I am getting in the coffin with him, cause I know where he is going. Maybe I can be his plus one.
885576050146779137 2017-07-13 19:05:58 UTC <lurie_john> @mookpool I used to do that, until they arrested me.
885575631454576640 2017-07-13 19:04:18 UTC <lurie_john> @TomWellborn you really dont even need to go there
885575161851891713 2017-07-13 19:02:26 UTC <lurie_john> I love Jimmy Carter. I flat out love the man.

885351050634383361 2017-07-12 04:11:54 UTC <lurie_john> @juliaamccurdy basically - it is funny but hateful. that really cant help anything in the end
885350303696080896 2017-07-12 04:08:56 UTC <lurie_john> @juliaamccurdy nah, you were right here.
885348734963523585 2017-07-12 04:02:42 UTC <lurie_john> @juliaamccurdy ha! is gone now. I thought you were the voice of moral reason - what do you mean "oh no!"
885348276597403649 2017-07-12 04:00:52 UTC <lurie_john> @juliaamccurdy yes - this is exactly right  ok - will take it down
885345740725374976 2017-07-12 03:50:48 UTC <lurie_john> @veggie64_leslie hard to get Nurse Ratched to laugh - will leave it up a minute
885344238778687490 2017-07-12 03:44:50 UTC <lurie_john> @criminalminds I dont know. This tweet has no redeeming qualities whatsoever

885327830879539200 2017-07-12 02:39:38 UTC <lurie_john> @SubBeck protest was awkward. not thought out. rubbed many the wrong way. but was done on spur of the moment and his heart was in the right place.
885326318644191232 2017-07-12 02:33:37 UTC <lurie_john> @SubBeck I think he gave up and went off to Ghana or somewhere to do volunteer work
885325669298831360 2017-07-12 02:31:02 UTC <lurie_john> @SubBeck reasonable - he seemed pretty bad last year but he is rated in the middle of the pack of QBs in the league  so the reason is clear I think
885321972258938880 2017-07-12 02:16:21 UTC <lurie_john> @SubBeck or else you are out of the league -  never mind chris
885319941091717121 2017-07-12 02:08:17 UTC <lurie_john> @SubBeck of the 60 or so NFL QBs - he ranks around 30th  - the reason he wasnt signed is clear - keep your mouth shut or else
885303052319588352 2017-07-12 01:01:10 UTC <lurie_john> @SubBeck you think the Jets, for example, could have used him?
885287575300210688 2017-07-12 23:59:40 UTC <lurie_john> Can you imagine if your Grandma wasn't allowed into the country because the president is an idiot? Make #grandmaban trend. thanks

884893557823340544 2017-07-11 21:53:59 UTC <lurie_john> @RSmytheFreed @aprildeming @ActualFlatticus no, Mr Kushner, I expect you to die.
884893331175636992 2017-07-11 21:53:05 UTC <lurie_john> @RSmytheFreed @ActualFlatticus @aprildeming I am jealous of any panties made without my name on them
884870866684825600 2017-07-11 20:23:49 UTC <lurie_john> @strikingthings thanks for clearing that up
884870694718386178 2017-07-11 20:23:08 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus @RSmytheFreed @aprildeming I have seen them posted before meanwhile this all seems to stem from Alan saying "naked and gold-painted Jared Kushner"
884865869477801984 2017-07-11 20:03:57 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus @RSmytheFreed @aprildeming oh geez
884859538310127616 2017-07-11 19:38:48 UTC <lurie_john> If I had a son, I would want him to be of "high quality." God bless President Trump
884856761882226688 2017-07-11 19:27:46 UTC <lurie_john> this didn't really happen. I am desperately avoiding stuff I dont want to do.
884856322784710656 2017-07-11 19:26:01 UTC <lurie_john> Don Jr just said "I'm a patsy!" Then Jack Ruby shot him.
884854593091497984 2017-07-11 19:19:09 UTC <lurie_john> @HaroldItz these very rich people came to Basquiats place to buy a painting and he made them pile into the limo to go out to White Castle in the Bronx
884851279884955648 2017-07-11 19:05:59 UTC <lurie_john> David Brooks, the man who mistook an idea for a sandwich.
884849569259036673 2017-07-11 18:59:11 UTC <lurie_john> @monkeyes he isnt going to jail though
884847410463330304 2017-07-11 18:50:36 UTC <lurie_john> @OhNoSheTwitnt @sheehan_cc what are you talking about CC
884847295749128192 2017-07-11 18:50:09 UTC <lurie_john> @monkeyes yeah I agree, except the punchable face thing in jail could really be a problem
884844550833000449 2017-07-11 18:39:15 UTC <lurie_john> @tbtltheresa007 @hodgman I didn't and managed to make fun of it without even reading it.
884843128213176323 2017-07-11 18:33:36 UTC <lurie_john> @OhNoSheTwitnt that cannot possibly happen. plus Huckabee plays the devil's music on the bass
884842846444036097 2017-07-11 18:32:28 UTC <lurie_john> @OhNoSheTwitnt actually, the idea that anyone would pay attention to something Huckabee says is rather astounding to me.
884842500090986498 2017-07-11 18:31:06 UTC <lurie_john> @OhNoSheTwitnt shut up, Mike Huckabee is a hero to me.
884842125027889152 2017-07-11 18:29:36 UTC <lurie_john> @ErynMYoung yeah, I read that

884833560661815298 2017-07-11 17:55:34 UTC <lurie_john> Has it occurred to no one that McConnell is trying to sabotage our healthcare because there is no healthcare for turtles?
884826113230458881 2017-07-11 17:25:59 UTC <lurie_john> @postlex I see. Perhaps, let's not speak of this further.
884824192402825216 2017-07-11 17:18:21 UTC <lurie_john> @postlex I dont understand the question
884822838145953794 2017-07-11 17:12:58 UTC <lurie_john> @patscutie12 I dont recognize my error - I realized I didnt want 45 moronic responses.
884820163585085441 2017-07-11 17:02:20 UTC <lurie_john> @patscutie12 I realize they arent a foreign adversary which was the point of the question
884819251445592064 2017-07-11 16:58:43 UTC <lurie_john> @patscutie12 @schakalsynthetc no, they dont have to. but do on many other places
884819063662403584 2017-07-11 16:57:58 UTC <lurie_john> @e_blyler and he lost. seems like one has to do really shrewd, horrific things to become president. but I do appreciate the campaign manager on this
884816931857076225 2017-07-11 16:49:30 UTC <lurie_john> if Russia contacted me and said they had dirt on Pitbull and I would never have to hear him again - I would jump at the opportunity

884627494032330752 2017-07-10 04:16:44 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus in all honesty, if you think your identity or location are safely protected - that is almost impossible to do these days
884626642102099974 2017-07-10 04:13:21 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus anyway, stop trying to change the subject and turn yourself in

884626050759741440 2017-07-10 04:11:00 UTC <lurie_john> @ActualFlatticus no, but putting that image in people's head most certainly is.
884595694690070529 2017-07-10 02:10:23 UTC <lurie_john> @bybowes I think he is handling it all pretty well. But come on the festivities started w Pitbull - good luck w the purity

883187059720060928 2017-07-06 04:52:58 UTC <lurie_john> I hope  Merkel, Trump and Putin decide to leave politics and start a band. The MerkelTrumpPutins. Writing a song for them now.
883185621879181312 2017-07-06 04:47:15 UTC <lurie_john> @paulschellinger no, we played in Hamburg many times, once with no hotel room. Is that kind of flashback.
883183465147101184 2017-07-06 04:38:41 UTC <lurie_john> Did Trump get a hotel room in Hamburg? Is he sleeping in the tour bus? What time is soundcheck?

881831090423508994 2017-07-03 11:04:50 UTC <lurie_john> @realDonaldTrump actually, maybe find out their names before the meeting.
881830762533834752 2017-07-03 11:03:32 UTC <lurie_john> @realDonaldTrump I suppose that means they think they will be speaking with America.

871462244315541504 2017-06-04 20:22:44 UTC <lurie_john> Theresa May suggests regulating the internet. I suggest regulating political lying for greed and power.
871460269339406336 2017-06-04 20:14:53 UTC <lurie_john> Theresa May and Trump are like people who gash themselves with a knife and then say - We must stop blood! We must put up walls against it!

871123940961394691 2017-06-03 21:58:26 UTC <lurie_john> HBO has informed me that if they replace Bill Maher - it will be with Mike Pence. We are fucked in all directions.

847834184408289281 2017-03-31 15:33:16 UTC <lurie_john> @fakelawn is way worse than that, is like all of downtown ny, rewrote history for their own gain about my friend who had passed
847831969744465921 2017-03-31 15:24:28 UTC <lurie_john> @fakelawn I never saw that either
847831698209460224 2017-03-31 15:23:23 UTC <lurie_john> @ACLU @archillect @openculture @JonCarling @DeanACavanagh @chikashiojima @ccohanlon @AsiaArgento @antonnewcombe Is that my boy Willem? awwww
847827420484861953 2017-03-31 15:06:23 UTC <lurie_john> @fakelawn Julian's ego blocking us out.
847827274175066112 2017-03-31 15:05:48 UTC <lurie_john> @fakelawn I try not to be bitter about these things but Julian turning Vince and I, Jean's actual friends, into one person was
847721214470610944 2017-03-31 08:04:22 UTC <lurie_john> @fakelawn I never saw it
847645867263668225 2017-03-30 03:04:57 UTC <lurie_john> @YouTube @cke5 no, but this song  - if you listen closely goes "John Coltrane, Coltrane, dont drink"
847642812275245056 2017-03-30 02:52:49 UTC <lurie_john> @hickoryburger I think that would be an excellent job for me
847586428972183553 2017-03-30 23:08:46 UTC <lurie_john> @atomicelroy I dont think they elected him to destroy the world. Only 7 or 8 of them, I would estimate
847582233154256898 2017-03-30 22:52:06 UTC <lurie_john> How many idiots does it take to screw an entire planet?  Please tell me the answer isn't -  one.
847574064562671617 2017-03-30 22:19:38 UTC <lurie_john> @Chris_Meloni @MatthewModine that's right he spit on you. Hope it was in the script and not improv
847528808802652164 2017-03-30 19:19:48 UTC <lurie_john> @fakelawn and he called me Lee Harvey Oswald
847528696147828736 2017-03-30 19:19:22 UTC <lurie_john> @fakelawn no, I called him Willie Mays from early on
847528397555331073 2017-03-30 19:18:10 UTC <lurie_john> Fuck, it is almost April? How does this shit happen?

847510541442650113 2017-03-30 18:07:13 UTC <lurie_john> @Chris_Meloni @MatthewModine let's start our own show and have Chris on, that'll show him
847378910144638977 2017-03-30 09:24:10 UTC <lurie_john> @MatthewModine oh, Christopher Meloni just got the better of you.
847373510536187904 2017-03-30 09:02:43 UTC <lurie_john> @MatthewModine you are on my tv playing a psychopath on Law and Order, I don't know why I am telling you this.
847349986257887234 2017-03-30 07:29:14 UTC <lurie_john> @lematroafdl I know this - love his tone on it
847331864977088512 2017-03-29 06:17:13 UTC <lurie_john> @mshvan her hair looks pretty good in the scene where she crawls out of the ocean and eats the Empire State Building

847258800738324480 2017-03-29 01:26:54 UTC <lurie_john> @maggieserota I refuse to apologize for my gender. But I am getting close
847247607248310272 2017-03-29 00:42:25 UTC <lurie_john> @ccnomad I agree w you about the intuitive nature
847236034169405442 2017-03-29 23:56:26 UTC <lurie_john> @ccnomad part of the package - wounded narcissist  - but certainly not someone who is not calculating
847235723639967744 2017-03-29 23:55:12 UTC <lurie_john> @ccnomad He is now the fucking President of the United States - you cannot get there without calculating

847188728611291136 2017-03-29 20:48:27 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john I fear this tweet may be obscure for the younger set
847187433284403201 2017-03-29 20:43:18 UTC <lurie_john> @much_sleep you look better than the dolts on your shirt. worried though, you seem worried
847141014905196544 2017-03-29 17:38:51 UTC <lurie_john> 1 litre of helium can lift a gram of matter one pound = 453.6 grams 1000 pounds = alligator 453,000 balloons
847139811622342657 2017-03-29 17:34:04 UTC <lurie_john> I think Cevirimiz  nailed it

847130935485190144 2017-03-29 16:58:48 UTC <lurie_john> I wonder how many helium balloons it would take to float an adult alligator.
847119298434940930 2017-03-29 16:12:34 UTC <lurie_john> @LizHackett can't you scare podcasters into stopping? do a service for all of us?

846818853443289088 2017-03-28 20:18:42 UTC <lurie_john> @OwenKilfeather sent a DM
846817850748751872 2017-03-28 20:14:43 UTC <lurie_john> @OwenKilfeather oh, that is such an odd coincidence - I am writing a book and trying to convey who Nana was or almost - what he was.
846815432317259776 2017-03-28 20:05:06 UTC <lurie_john> @johnbrissenden I cant play any more because of the Lyme - it used to come at me, fill my heart and I would put it back out, now I just weep

846808792566255616 2017-03-28 19:38:43 UTC <lurie_john> If you want to make amazing music, it is best to have a funny name.
846808617089150976 2017-03-28 19:38:01 UTC <lurie_john> @kashanacauley you really need to change your name to Cash - then it will fall into place
846150175424962562 2017-03-26 00:01:37 UTC <lurie_john> @SteveHuff both of them and the writing and the timing. The pacing of the scene just makes it perfect - have watched it 100 times
846144644589260800 2017-03-26 23:39:38 UTC <lurie_john> @jbelcap @SteveHuff  won and he is a good person. If you break his legs that will hurt your chances of winning future contests

845740074507685890 2017-03-25 20:52:01 UTC <lurie_john> @tonyfaulkner I am suing you anyway.
845739880554676224 2017-03-25 20:51:15 UTC <lurie_john> @DBanksy @frankietaggart but then a 3rd party could record the busker and it would become libel without them knowing?
845704106694131712 2017-03-25 18:29:06 UTC <lurie_john> @DBanksy @frankietaggart Ah! thanks. But then which is twitter? And has anyone ever been sued for a twitter post?
845701029370978304 2017-03-25 18:16:52 UTC <lurie_john> @DBanksy the law is different in US?  And if I libel someone in Wales but am somewhere else, what is the law then? I have questions
845699237660774400 2017-03-25 18:09:45 UTC <lurie_john> @DBanksy really? It would be libel if spoken on the radio?
845697896603435008 2017-03-25 18:04:25 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john A. No, slander is spoken.  Libel is written.
845694009301454848 2017-03-25 17:48:58 UTC <lurie_john> @patersonplan @WeAreHere I already knew, it was a trick question! Aglet!
845477442320044036 2017-03-24 03:28:25 UTC <lurie_john> @ChristofPierson you misspelled "an asshole."
845473799403454466 2017-03-24 03:13:56 UTC <lurie_john> @patersonplan only related in the astounding idea that I am still here
845473067644194816 2017-03-24 03:11:02 UTC <lurie_john> @rddrayton not on here
845473014401650688 2017-03-24 03:10:49 UTC <lurie_john> @TallGuyCM really strong basketball. no stupidity outside of Bill Rafferty
845472881664495616 2017-03-24 03:10:17 UTC <lurie_john> @patersonplan they were very different tweets
845470629600092162 2017-03-24 03:01:20 UTC <lurie_john> @patersonplan he never responded to me
845470324149899265 2017-03-24 03:00:08 UTC <lurie_john> @patersonplan if he knew what they called the plastic thing at the end of a shoelace
845469117104689152 2017-03-24 02:55:20 UTC <lurie_john> When I first got on twitter - I tweeted Justin Bieber 40 or 50 times and they took my blue check away.
845448397243011072 2017-03-24 01:33:00 UTC <lurie_john> @mehdirhasan @kylegriffin1 where did the "c" come from?
845414808417718273 2017-03-24 23:19:32 UTC <lurie_john> @RepJoeKennedy "accidental humanity" great phrase
845328344086450177 2017-03-24 17:35:57 UTC <lurie_john> @realDonaldTrump I'm sure it is difficult to get through your day being an idiot and I do sympathize. But Climate Change is real, you idiot.
845324509003558912 2017-03-24 17:20:42 UTC <lurie_john> @HMittelmark we can do it in a gas station - I have no problem with that
845324242279378945 2017-03-24 17:19:39 UTC <lurie_john> TRUMP MUST GO.  please RT until your fingers bleed thank you
845323715617394689 2017-03-24 17:17:33 UTC <lurie_john> I am quietly envisioning a Mussolini stye ending for Mr Trump.  It is legal to envision or at least it was last week. Law probably changed.
845160554431852545 2017-03-23 06:29:13 UTC <lurie_john> @MarinRymer is a great movie
845119909721923584 2017-03-23 03:47:42 UTC <lurie_john> @Rob_Hoffman yes, I would like to thank the fellow upstairs for making the other team lose
845119221738582019 2017-03-23 03:44:58 UTC <lurie_john> @crayon_ponyfish good point!

845090632280498178 2017-03-23 01:51:22 UTC <lurie_john> @MDaviot I bet you could watch it again, imagining the truck driver is Trump and it would be great
845062260359905284 2017-03-23 23:58:38 UTC <lurie_john> Have you seen the movie Duel? This is the truck driver Spielberg, brilliantly, never allows you to see.pic.twitter.com/QiuGgI4wkF

844982659126366208 2017-03-23 18:42:19 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john best wishes, the scientists.
844982426019532802 2017-03-23 18:41:24 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john It is likely that in every breath you draw, there will be one molecule of air from the last breath of Cleopatra.

844798920970551296 2017-03-22 06:32:13 UTC <lurie_john> @kelly_carlin we used to do that to our drummer on tour, so we could get him back in time to leave in the morning

844794232804032512 2017-03-22 06:13:35 UTC <lurie_john> Binge watching is evil. Netflix should be illegal. I wrote a lot of music on heroin. Last 6 hours, I have just sat here.

844790163142164480 2017-03-22 05:57:24 UTC <lurie_john> I am binge watching The Blacklist. James Spader is a very strange actor. And I need an intervention.

844321184690982913 2017-03-21 22:53:51 UTC <lurie_john> @ThugLifeSocial I love that scene - that is where Jack Nicholson says - you want the truth, you can't handle the truth.
844285478744588288 2017-03-21 20:31:58 UTC <lurie_john> @Jonatha07553932 she also shot Lee Harvey Oswald

838956788041015297 2017-03-06 03:37:39 UTC <lurie_john> I would find it most comforting to learn that some mornings, Trump wakes up and goes - Holy shit! I am president? That is just fucking nuts!

838904481077145600 2017-03-06 00:09:49 UTC <lurie_john> @IndyWildWatch over and over again, - "Ladies and gentlemen, Bud Powell!" Is that what you are doing here?
838904263438893056 2017-03-06 00:08:57 UTC <lurie_john> @IndyWildWatch when Bud Powell was having his breakdown and kept fucking up a Charlie Parker gig, Parker stood on stage, saying

838850665640247296 2017-03-06 20:35:58 UTC <lurie_john> A #MuslimBan is unconstitutional and unAmerican. You can't make America great if it is no longer America.

829058223126753281 2017-02-07 20:04:18 UTC <lurie_john> @G_Blott when did I threaten to kill a hummingbird? do you write for the New Yorker?
829056660861833217 2017-02-07 19:58:05 UTC <lurie_john> @j_smithcameron exactly, there were no paleontologists in dark ages - no concept of what a dinosaur looked like
829056254073040897 2017-02-07 19:56:28 UTC <lurie_john> @j_smithcameron anyway, at the moment my dragon looks like a cow. May have to change title of painting
829056112464953344 2017-02-07 19:55:54 UTC <lurie_john> @j_smithcameron but I believe there was a concept of what a dragon looked like way before dinosaurs started getting reconstructed
829055833082322944 2017-02-07 19:54:48 UTC <lurie_john> @G_Blott you started w "dead hummingbirds"

803319267668230145 2016-11-28 19:26:53 UTC <lurie_john> @axxon_n I dont know what is offensive. It is my most beautiful idea ever
803316719263551488 2016-11-28 19:16:45 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john when they call for Muslims to register - the news will say  - the overwhelming number of Muslims who registered are named Trump
803315882495766528 2016-11-28 19:13:25 UTC <lurie_john> Since this appears to be the end of the world anyway, everyone please consider legally changing their name to Donald J. Trump.  #FUN!
803315137335664640 2016-11-28 19:10:28 UTC <lurie_john> @tonycruzdj you are my new best friend, well you would be if I would ever be able to spell your name
803314238898995201 2016-11-28 19:06:54 UTC <lurie_john> the point is that if they force Muslims to register, everyone must register. Muslim or not, so registration means nothing
803313561762168834 2016-11-28 19:04:12 UTC <lurie_john> I have legally changed my name to Joel Osteen, today. If Trump forces Muslims to register, I too will register. best wishes, Joel

801130789643714561 2016-11-22 18:30:39 UTC <lurie_john> but they would have to trade for Curry, James, Westbrook, Durant  etc but keep them in states that did have Daylight Savings

801127987756273664 2016-11-22 18:19:31 UTC <lurie_john> yeah but so would the boss. And it is just one big late.
801127710453968896 2016-11-22 18:18:25 UTC <lurie_john> If we used all the Daylight Savings hours for the next 35042 years, we could jump ahead to 2020.

796558701381435392 2016-11-09 03:42:48 UTC <lurie_john> @chrislhayes I am doing a study in sleep deprivation from election. I think you just fouled out.
796540558894309376 2016-11-09 02:30:42 UTC <lurie_john> @insunlite then I get 49 responses that destroy my faith in the human mind

796430503155003392 2016-11-09 19:13:23 UTC <lurie_john> .@Scotus if anyone would like a salad or a blanket or help getting to a yoga class, there are millions of people willing to help.
796429724847374339 2016-11-09 19:10:18 UTC <lurie_john> @fakelawn we are all to blame, in one way or another. Fuck this is insane
796429422287011840 2016-11-09 19:09:05 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john and don't even think about retiring or you could be replaced by Gary Busey.
796429069759946752 2016-11-09 19:07:41 UTC <lurie_john> Dear SCOTUS  members  -  please eat healthily. Get your sleep and exercise.
796428545195184130 2016-11-09 19:05:36 UTC <lurie_john> The damage is done. It doesn't help anything to blame other people.
796337620817158145 2016-11-09 13:04:18 UTC <lurie_john> @observer oh shut up
796301413404045312 2016-11-09 10:40:26 UTC <lurie_john> @dasspinoza you have a similar problem - I know
796297517969379328 2016-11-09 10:24:57 UTC <lurie_john> @9EndlessShrimp6 I know, like the dog that chases cars and finally catches one, then goes "now what?"
796297045480906752 2016-11-09 10:23:04 UTC <lurie_john> @mpersivale I think that is what is going to happen
796294815042469889 2016-11-09 10:14:13 UTC <lurie_john> @ajmanx I have 4 paintings I have been working on for 3 months - all almost finished - wouldn't dare work on them now
796294540038705152 2016-11-09 10:13:07 UTC <lurie_john> @jischinger no and I was their harshest critic
796294074554871808 2016-11-09 10:11:16 UTC <lurie_john> @TheAdamGoldberg I am going to figure out a way to blame this on you.  Might take a minute
796293875572887552 2016-11-09 10:10:29 UTC <lurie_john> @Randazzoj @whiffen_rhona I know what you guys want, lets not speak of this in public
796293644705820673 2016-11-09 10:09:33 UTC <lurie_john> A lot of people are going to need protecting now. We must all commit to this.
796293236843249664 2016-11-09 10:07:56 UTC <lurie_john> I have been walking in a counter clockwise circle for an hour now. Will try the other direction and see if I come up with anything.
796292958664478720 2016-11-09 10:06:50 UTC <lurie_john> I never thought this could happen. Not for a moment. I apologize for doubting it.
796291952262135810 2016-11-09 10:02:50 UTC <lurie_john> @Randazzoj @CBMDP that was a long time ago
796291029104263169 2016-11-09 09:59:10 UTC <lurie_john> @kelly_carlin going to walk in circles for a couple of hours first.
796289819114545153 2016-11-09 09:54:21 UTC <lurie_john> @Randazzoj not sure that will help
796289358143909888 2016-11-09 09:52:31 UTC <lurie_john> @Randazzoj I am really in shock
796289082280341504 2016-11-09 09:51:26 UTC <lurie_john> no one is sleeping, are they?
796267727342092293 2016-11-09 08:26:34 UTC <lurie_john> @vurnt22 uncharted sounds right
796254571802857472 2016-11-08 07:34:18 UTC <lurie_john> @MrGregDulli Nero, I presume?
796248328472301568 2016-11-08 07:09:29 UTC <lurie_john> I am loving Van Jones right now. Voice of reason and compassion when obviously he is really hurting.
796235687884455939 2016-11-08 06:19:15 UTC <lurie_john> @ReelQuinn I know - this is too nuts
796228894047305729 2016-11-08 05:52:16 UTC <lurie_john> fair enough -   but he meant it
796228405133983744 2016-11-08 05:50:19 UTC <lurie_john> @VanJones68 children as a prop  - yes didnt feel he was doing that
796227860818259969 2016-11-08 05:48:09 UTC <lurie_john> I had vowed to never watch CNN again but switched it on to see @VanJones68 give a really impassioned, intelligent few minutes
796214916201979904 2016-11-08 04:56:43 UTC <lurie_john> Canada's Immigration Website has crashed. No shit. Not a joke.
796199721966694400 2016-11-08 03:56:21 UTC <lurie_john> @PatrickDillett this is your fault. I can't figure out exactly why, yet. But will by morning
796198767108222980 2016-11-08 03:52:33 UTC <lurie_john> lot more, I would assume
796198614439759872 2016-11-08 03:51:56 UTC <lurie_john> @champsuperstar wow - packing and panicking are almost the same word, will have to look into this as soon as I finish panicking/packing
796198320146436096 2016-11-08 03:50:46 UTC <lurie_john> @champsuperstar panic sounds right
796198223497068544 2016-11-08 03:50:23 UTC <lurie_john> once I took LSD and saw policemen waving at me who weren't there. this is way more nuts than that
796197851785203712 2016-11-08 03:48:55 UTC <lurie_john> @champsuperstar I got more offers from Mexico  ok - see you Friday
796197472481775616 2016-11-08 03:47:24 UTC <lurie_john> @champsuperstar this is like people rushing to get off the Titanic - sorry, I just elbowed you in the neck
796197302532796418 2016-11-08 03:46:44 UTC <lurie_john> @_kate_o_ fair enough
796196998814765061 2016-11-08 03:45:31 UTC <lurie_john> @Rob_Hoffman I am pretty shocked, I have to say. I think we underestimated how distrusted and hated she was.
796196436614516736 2016-11-08 03:43:17 UTC <lurie_john> this is the most insane thing I have ever seen
796176043916853249 2016-11-08 02:22:15 UTC <lurie_john> fuck the election - look what the human beings can do  go to 7:06   OH PLEASE - MAKE IT STOP, I CAN"T STAND IThttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABLwmYI09Lw

796145367226187776 2016-11-08 00:20:21 UTC <lurie_john> @linnyitssn somebody has to fix all this. Can you do it? I am painting.
796145108601229313 2016-11-08 00:19:20 UTC <lurie_john> @c_weckesser he is remarkable
796144151087771648 2016-11-08 00:15:31 UTC <lurie_john> @linnyitssn there is still media?

796089978539438080 2016-11-08 20:40:16 UTC <lurie_john> Election is so fucking rigged. Everyone I know voted for Giant Meteor. I keep looking out the window and nothing.

795800775062593537 2016-11-07 01:31:04 UTC <lurie_john> Glenn Beck puts on his hats like everyone else, one head at a time.
795786925424709634 2016-11-07 00:36:02 UTC <lurie_john> @Luna_Pond that would mean The Jubilee of Pope Boniface VIII  never happened.

795450133274132481 2016-11-06 02:17:45 UTC <lurie_john> Toward the end she would sit on the porch and see things that might not be there

795397493345447937 2016-11-06 22:48:34 UTC <lurie_john> @stealthisbook I wonder if they rushed through the dic pics or examined them for secret messages
795396151935639552 2016-11-06 22:43:15 UTC <lurie_john> @joelmgarland Joel Marsh Garland says "trousers."  I might start acting again so I can tell people about this.
795395741850234880 2016-11-06 22:41:37 UTC <lurie_john> @SkeletonRainbow for fuck sakes - it is a bipartisan joke about Comey taking an hour to get his pants on. C'mon yourself.
795395350496428038 2016-11-06 22:40:03 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john I guess he could have read them with no pants on. Sorry to put that image in your head.
795394773091831808 2016-11-06 22:37:46 UTC <lurie_john> @joelmgarland "trousers" what a strange word
795378842747670528 2016-11-06 21:34:28 UTC <lurie_john> @TheGastofGy I decided to ignore that fact for the sake of humor
795374292682833920 2016-11-06 21:16:23 UTC <lurie_john> If Trump wins,  when they tell a child that is a complete idiot - "you could grow up to be president."  It will finally be true.
795368169284243456 2016-11-06 20:52:03 UTC <lurie_john> I wake up and it is dark out. I am sure Daylight Savings is a government conspiracy to keep artists depressed.

794765900658384896 2016-11-04 04:58:51 UTC <lurie_john> @exxulansis thank you again.
794764075205099520 2016-11-04 04:51:36 UTC <lurie_john> In my mind the World Series is still going on.

794762376746795008 2016-11-04 04:44:51 UTC <lurie_john> @ARTofCOOP you are a fair and decent man
794762183641022464 2016-11-04 04:44:05 UTC <lurie_john> @ARTofCOOP I deserve it
794761724771627008 2016-11-04 04:42:15 UTC <lurie_john> I am fed up with this election.  If you feel the same, send me $5.  Thank you.
794757426406948864 2016-11-04 04:25:10 UTC <lurie_john> @brucedenby @mshvan @Punjikasthala "flabber" one who joins into a conversation with nonsense.
794755585602453504 2016-11-04 04:17:52 UTC <lurie_john> @exxulansis on my roof with a flashlight right - yelling "pick me! pick me!"
794754543036862464 2016-11-04 04:13:43 UTC <lurie_john> @exxulansis doesnt matter who wins. It wont be over. Alien invasion is our only hope
794753211701882881 2016-11-04 04:08:26 UTC <lurie_john> @exxulansis thank you. I was ready for that
794733861037113345 2016-11-04 02:51:32 UTC <lurie_john> @LostCatDog he really is one of my favorite actors
794618824758849536 2016-11-04 19:14:25 UTC <lurie_john> I've had it with white people. I want to be traded.
794614200941314049 2016-11-04 18:56:03 UTC <lurie_john> I vote for every politician to be incarcerated until proven innocent.  How do I write that in?
794470189999886336 2016-11-04 09:23:48 UTC <lurie_john> @mshvan no, dont know what that means but I know that Tesla would only stay in hotel rooms and floors that were multiples of 3
794469545448710144 2016-11-04 09:21:14 UTC <lurie_john> @mshvan I knew both of these facts. You are useless to me.
794468911928508420 2016-11-04 09:18:43 UTC <lurie_john> @mshvan ok, I will invent 1,109 more. None will be in use.
794468220052926464 2016-11-04 09:15:58 UTC <lurie_john> @mshvan did you know Shakespeare invented 800 words? I have him beat by 91 words.

794467441871097856 2016-11-04 09:12:53 UTC <lurie_john> @BiancaJagger of course not
794467182860177408 2016-11-04 09:11:51 UTC <lurie_john> @bloodhaiI it is, it is why I joined twitter
794466943927517184 2016-11-04 09:10:54 UTC <lurie_john> @bloodhaiI I just misspelled harassment.
794466364220129280 2016-11-04 09:08:36 UTC <lurie_john> @bloodhaiI if we both block Rob Delaney until he brings back the speedo would that be sexual harrasment?
794465990750961664 2016-11-04 09:07:07 UTC <lurie_john> @bloodhaiI thank you Michael, my kindness often goes overlooked.
794464408084811777 2016-11-04 09:00:49 UTC <lurie_john> @bloodhaiI well this is important news! thank you Michael!  that is you isn't it?
794463350885351424 2016-11-04 08:56:37 UTC <lurie_john> Tom Hardy is amazing in the Revenant. Michael Clayton is an excellent movie. This is your 5 am review of movies you have already seen.
794389696193458177 2016-11-03 04:03:57 UTC <lurie_john> @RealSkipBayless you look like the Piers Morgan of sports.
794352392322039811 2016-11-03 01:35:43 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin ok, no way to sort this out on twitter -   just cool it with the - "you must,"" you should" - posts  ok?
794351992130912256 2016-11-03 01:34:07 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin but seriously, I believed these reports because Stephanie Seneff was presented as top MIT researcher  if not true ....
794351383851974657 2016-11-03 01:31:42 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin autism is on a horrifyingly, shocking rise. Saying it is because it is being diagnosed more often is glib.
794348993602011136 2016-11-03 01:22:13 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin because 1/2 of children being autistic by 2025 is something everyone should feel strongly about
794348759534673920 2016-11-03 01:21:17 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin now you are saying that is not the case. If it is not, you must let the public know this.
794348504009363456 2016-11-03 01:20:16 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin I just want information that is true. I tended to believe what I read about Stephanie Seneff because she was an MIT researcher
794347330661208064 2016-11-03 01:15:36 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin her field. She is bat shit crazy and very dangerous. And MIT has to make a statement about this.
794347101211725825 2016-11-03 01:14:41 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin if she is proclaiming, as a top MIT researcher, that 1/2 of children will be autistic due to Monsanto by 2025 and this is not
794346160261632000 2016-11-03 01:10:57 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin "conspiracy theory" is hardly an argument that holds water any longer.  But if she is nuts, MIT has to make that clear.
794342131645186049 2016-11-03 00:54:57 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin which say that due to Monsanto pesticides - 1/2 of children will be autistic by 2025. Which is 1 reason I cant vote for HRC
794341635932979200 2016-11-03 00:52:58 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin can you stop with the "you should" "you must?" I have read countless articles on top "MIT researcher"  Stephanie Seneff
794339120311136256 2016-11-03 00:42:59 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin so one shouldn't pay attention to people who call themselves MIT researchers "must" of the time?
794336943681241088 2016-11-03 00:34:20 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin well MIT researcher, I presume you do not agree with MIT reseacher Stephanie Seneff on Monsanto?
794334576550309888 2016-11-03 00:24:55 UTC <lurie_john> @eggwithfeet did you quit your job?
794333865552859136 2016-11-03 00:22:06 UTC <lurie_john> @jason_pontin did you mean "most?"
794324524904960008 2016-11-03 23:44:59 UTC <lurie_john> @PatrickDillett he does in me.
794324340196118529 2016-11-03 23:44:15 UTC <lurie_john> Michael Wilbon? Michael Wincott? Michelle Williams? Who?
794319740261060611 2016-11-03 23:25:58 UTC <lurie_john> @gueriera what I want to vote for is far from what is on the ballot

794039876681420800 2016-11-02 04:53:53 UTC <lurie_john> ESPN has to have Steve Bartman. There has to be a parade for Steve Bartman. I rooted for Cubs because of Steve Bartman.

772428445909262337 2016-09-04 13:37:47 UTC <lurie_john> @joelmgarland do pheromones actually smell?  I dont think they do
772425719372668928 2016-09-04 13:26:57 UTC <lurie_john> @grahamgillies7 I am actually curious about who operates all these porn bots and how it benefits anyone
772423275221843968 2016-09-04 13:17:14 UTC <lurie_john> @grahamgillies7 yeah, I did that a long time ago.

772421640906870784 2016-09-04 13:10:44 UTC <lurie_john> Will all the people who fell out be friends again after the election? Asking for a friend. What am I saying? I have no friends left.

769441012598972416 2016-08-27 07:46:47 UTC <lurie_john> If you spend 12 hours painting a sea monster, then you say, "stupid sea monster." It's not because it is bad. That is just what you say.

764187621375389696 2016-08-12 19:51:41 UTC <lurie_john> @filthymcnasty Porn Bot will do absolutely nothing - which is what we need
764185675323158528 2016-08-12 19:43:57 UTC <lurie_john> @Aliteraryshadow Porn Bot does not drink alcohol nor sit down in person. That should not influence your vote though.
764185352168800256 2016-08-12 19:42:40 UTC <lurie_john> Porn Bot is neither fascist nor corrupt. Porn Bot does not support fracking.  Porn Bot treats all people equally. Elect Porn Bot in 2016

764176522286477313 2016-08-12 19:07:35 UTC <lurie_john> If we write in Porn Bot as a presidential vote, do we have to pick a specific Porn Bot?

763923351899295744 2016-08-11 02:21:34 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john I think is is the bizarre combination of unassuming dorkiness and ferocious game face. He sure has won me over.
763922803301101569 2016-08-11 02:19:23 UTC <lurie_john> crazy how you can love someone like Phelps - who wins and wins - you would think you would hate him

763829987799539712 2016-08-11 20:10:35 UTC <lurie_john> @inkersive jesus fuck - I didnt know that
763829323258171392 2016-08-11 20:07:56 UTC <lurie_john> I think Trump just uses words incorrectly. Flashcards are a possible solution. Flashcards can be fun!

763078104713613312 2016-08-09 18:22:52 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john He was sure coffee would arrive shortly.
763078007355432964 2016-08-09 18:22:28 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john "911, what is your emergency?" a kind voice said. "Coffee, I need coffee." "What is your address sir?" He gave the address.
763077669453901824 2016-08-09 18:21:08 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john By throwing his slipper, he managed to knock the phone off the counter onto the floor. He slithered close to it and dialed.
763076984813473792 2016-08-09 18:18:25 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john but there was no coffee. No amount of cheering would help now.
763076473674534912 2016-08-09 18:16:23 UTC <lurie_john> @lurie_john If he could just get to the coffee, maybe he would become a person like other people and do things.
763075861251620865 2016-08-09 18:13:57 UTC <lurie_john> Then the man crawled across the kitchen floor to get coffee. He imagined a roaring crowd, cheering him on.

760940416904470528 2016-08-03 20:48:27 UTC <lurie_john> @flea333 But you couldn't sleep. I went to the head of the village and asked when the drums would stop. He said, "when drums stop, very bad.

760872918783930368 2016-08-03 16:20:14 UTC <lurie_john> Trump doesnt want to be president, realizes he will be held accountable - so he makes insane mistakes. Supporters go  "hmm good point."

749994569798856709 2016-07-04 15:53:34 UTC <lurie_john> Durant going to GS. Is like an actor editing shots of himself into last years great movie.
749993078493065216 2016-07-04 15:47:38 UTC <lurie_john> If Durant wins a ring with Golden State, how does that even feel like an accomplishment for him?

749739932634066944 2016-07-03 23:01:44 UTC <lurie_john> Sometimes Trump says something I agree with. Then I have a team of doctors come and recalibrate my brain.

747073308454092803 2016-06-26 14:25:31 UTC <lurie_john> The one positive thing that may come from this election is that Trump supporters will learn the difference between "your" and "you're"

745698473756917762 2016-06-22 19:22:25 UTC <lurie_john> @JonathanDBrown I dont care about Democrats. I care about gun control and this is happening right now

745635546018390016 2016-06-22 15:12:22 UTC <lurie_john> @RoyMckenzie @BenSpielberg @RoyMcKenzie that sounds about right. So I assume the least favorable will be next president - Paul Ryan I guess.
745633390137741312 2016-06-22 15:03:48 UTC <lurie_john> I wonder if when Bill and Hillary move back into the White House, will they bring back the furniture they stole last time?
