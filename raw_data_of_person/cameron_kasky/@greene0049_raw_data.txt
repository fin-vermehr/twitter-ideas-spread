966700082270744576 2018-02-22 15:43:54 UTC <greene0049> How many Americans believe the NRA and other lobbyists should have unlimited political power?
966699726677700608 2018-02-22 15:42:29 UTC <greene0049> NRA and LaPierre act as if they are a branch of govt.

NRA injects itself between public & Congress.

966692844714029057 2018-02-22 15:15:09 UTC <greene0049> The NRA's LaPierre said "Their Laws" as if he wishes to separate NRA from U.S. laws. LaPierre, we don't want our schools to become armed camps. LaPierre spoke today as if our govt is the enemy. This is why they believe they need guns to protect themselves from the govt. Wrong.
966690516808208384 2018-02-22 15:05:54 UTC <greene0049> We implore millennials, throughout the future, to permanently take power, through your vote, from lobbyists and special interest groups, like NRA, & all the others.
966685921025449985 2018-02-22 14:47:38 UTC <greene0049> @CNN Politicians should consult their closest loved ones on issues as a 1st guide where their moral compass should lead.

966467509368049664 2018-02-21 00:19:44 UTC <greene0049> Trump has vacillated on numerous issues, including gun issues.

959456775857754113 2018-02-02 16:01:35 UTC <greene0049> no new federal law is perfect.  it is incumbent upon legislators to work together to enhance laws, in spite of their differences, for betterment of Americans. one party alone cannot be successful. both parties must help laws work. they hav to move past differences for us.https://twitter.com/StacyLStiles/status/959264414150033413
959455034433003521 2018-02-02 15:54:40 UTC <greene0049> Why, because he was God-fearing, respects Michelle, turned around a weak economy, produced healthcare for millions, set records employing Americans, made extensive education efforts, helped Earth's environment, or because GOP congress refused to help enhance any of his policieshttps://twitter.com/StacyLStiles/status/959264414150033413
959453002410135552 2018-02-02 15:46:36 UTC <greene0049> yes, according to people who support a self-describe and accused, repeated female molester, adulterer, liar, egotist, obsessive/compulsive, immature authoritarian. His wife doesn't even respect Trump any more.  How can you?https://twitter.com/StacyLStiles/status/959264414150033413
959203490273943552 2018-02-01 23:15:07 UTC <greene0049> @ChrisVanHollen I think the irrational behavior of the GOP regarding the memo means McConnell and Ryan believe their Trump is at grave risk of serious harm by the Russia Investigation findings.
959200601233084416 2018-02-01 23:03:39 UTC <greene0049> @NatashaFatah just imagine how many times this #SuperBlueBloodMoon has occurred in time...wow...
959188810604171266 2018-02-01 22:16:47 UTC <greene0049> @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi Please redact the Democratic  rebuttal memo & give it to CNN NOW or at least simultaneously with publicizing the GOP memo!!!
959179680602624000 2018-02-01 21:40:31 UTC <greene0049> @jaketapper I'd like to ask, since GOP leaders know Trump is a liar, why they risk their careers for a liar? History will look MOST POORLY on Trump & all GOP, & I don't understand why they risk their careers & put a liar over theirs and their families reputations. Trump WILL decimate GOP.

959175899785711617 2018-02-01 21:25:29 UTC <greene0049> My question of Paul Ryan & GOP leaders is, "Does the GOP leadership support all the inaccurate comments Trump makes, e.g. STOU viewership lie?" Conversely you allowed a republican to call Pres Obama a "liar" during his STOU. Yes we know GOP planned saying "liar" at 44 SOTU
958891662058643456 2018-01-31 02:36:02 UTC <greene0049> More lies from Trump...https://twitter.com/WhipHoyer/status/958537188802691079
958885191078088704 2018-01-31 02:10:19 UTC <greene0049> @FBI @WhipHoyer ...and Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders are complicit.
958750372377628674 2018-01-31 17:14:36 UTC <greene0049> I served in Central America for six years (US Air Force). Also I traveled to many South American countries. I learned, from Central & S. Americans, they dont agree USA can call itself America. E.g., Brits dont nickname the U.K., Europe. Our name is not America.
958737502097100800 2018-01-31 16:23:27 UTC <greene0049> The USA is not an island. We are stronger working with other nations and accepting other nationalities.https://twitter.com/mystere1979/status/958375708790788096
958735406526291968 2018-01-31 16:15:08 UTC <greene0049> @HouseDemocrats Trumps M.O. is to muddy the waters to cast doubt onto issues and allegations Trump opposes.
958146004338999296 2018-01-29 01:13:03 UTC <greene0049> @NancyPelosi The GOP must explain why they would nominate a self-admitted sexual assault attacker. Will they do it again? They should answer for this.
958048370165153795 2018-01-29 18:45:05 UTC <greene0049> @ClintSmithIII @arthur_affect We cant GUARANTEE what he was looking at or, at the time, what was in his mind. Turning our heads sweeps past hundreds of glances, right?  Our interpretation of this fraction of a second in time is based upon our experiences. Is this the start middle or end of turning his head?
958046119447158784 2018-01-29 18:36:09 UTC <greene0049> @ClintSmithIII @southofwyoming @UNSEATpac ...and it's the reason GOP almost never worked with Pres. Obama on issues. Obama was not perfect, but he tried to do good, but GOP did not care if it was good for the nation, they blindly voted against him.
