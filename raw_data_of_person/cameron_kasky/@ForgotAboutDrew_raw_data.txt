727323637091430400 2016-05-02 02:27:22 UTC <ForgotAboutDrew> Question: can Leonard score without pushing off?
726582768902135810 2016-04-30 01:23:26 UTC <ForgotAboutDrew> So DPOY = landing on someone going for a rebound no foul. Hassan tips the ball to the hoop and gets called for a loose ball foul. Gotcha
726581353588744192 2016-04-30 01:17:48 UTC <ForgotAboutDrew> Lmao Foye just locked Leonard down
