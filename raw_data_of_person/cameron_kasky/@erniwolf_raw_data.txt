912886733712314368 2017-09-26 03:48:52 UTC <erniwolf> @realDonaldTrump @cherrypitts69 Indeed, it's hard, especially as it feels we often wake to an unending wave of calamity found in damning tweets and off-script rants.

911844137858666496 2017-09-23 06:45:58 UTC <erniwolf> @realDonaldTrump So, please, fellow White folk: Please, please, please stand up against hate, cruelty, and evil. Stand for love, goodness, and community.
911843819863384064 2017-09-23 06:44:42 UTC <erniwolf> @realDonaldTrump I'd rather strive for compassion, love, and empathy, and yes, these are values I work to instill in my children and youth I work with.
911843089085591552 2017-09-23 06:41:48 UTC <erniwolf> @realDonaldTrump Call me a snowflake. Mock my faith as a Christian who actually gives a shit about people. Label me a sinner, liberal, or heathen.
911842344277872640 2017-09-23 06:38:50 UTC <erniwolf> @realDonaldTrump How does any of this Make America Great Again? From my vantage point, it doesn't.
911841791112093696 2017-09-23 06:36:38 UTC <erniwolf> @realDonaldTrump sexist comments, and a complete disregard for any discernible moral compass? I ask as a fellow White person confused by your reality.
911841414723620864 2017-09-23 06:35:09 UTC <erniwolf> @realDonaldTrump White folk who support Trump: Is this truly what you stand for? Do you unequivocally stand behind racial slurs, inflammatory remarks...
911840679214624768 2017-09-23 06:32:13 UTC <erniwolf> Went to the Civil Rights Museum in Atlanta this week. @realDonaldTrump's rhetoric mirrors the past, which is no surprise to those listening.

811212556010450945 2016-12-20 14:11:59 UTC <erniwolf> Day Twenty-Four by Tuhina Verma Rasche: Great wisdom from @rozellahw. We are called to be dynamic. #fuckthisshit https://medium.com/fuckthisshit/day-twenty-four-3dfc4efc4991?source=twitterShare-704fa159aae9-1482242686
811102842782105600 2016-12-19 06:56:01 UTC <erniwolf> @diakonia78 : And so are you! Thank YOU for the gift you are to all of us!
809959976353591296 2016-12-16 03:14:41 UTC <erniwolf> @diakonia78 : Oh my goodness, yes. Your words ring true for my own experience with this devotional as well. Hugely transformative.
809958823909818368 2016-12-16 03:10:06 UTC <erniwolf> In moments like these, it's hard to keep going, but Love calls me to keep on. Love changes everything. Love makes hard times bearable.
809957726419877888 2016-12-16 03:05:44 UTC <erniwolf> But through #fuckthisshit and through the pain of loss and uncertainty, finding the moments of light and hope have been a great discipline.
809957553069314048 2016-12-16 03:05:03 UTC <erniwolf> But I still let the tears come, as much as I hate the pain I feel. I hate the vulnerability. I hate feeling helpless and useless.
809957299678773248 2016-12-16 03:04:03 UTC <erniwolf> I remember a time when I couldn't cry, when I simply felt numb to everything. Now I'm in a season where I feel so deeply, I want to scream.
809957133714395136 2016-12-16 03:03:23 UTC <erniwolf> Between strokes, death, and brain tumors with close friends and family, not to mention tragedy afar, I've ugly cried almost daily.
809956929179189256 2016-12-16 03:02:34 UTC <erniwolf> It's been a week that has left me wanting to say #fuckthisshit more often than not. The devotional discipline and community have helped.
809956713797480449 2016-12-16 03:01:43 UTC <erniwolf> @diakonia78 : Sending hugs and love to you, friend.
809479612065579008 2016-12-15 19:25:53 UTC <erniwolf> This Advent season has been full... of loss, pain, joy, tears, laughter, birth, death, life. But through it all, we are not alone.
807433012262662147 2016-12-09 03:53:26 UTC <erniwolf> @diakonia78 @Medium: Wow, thank you so much! I am humbled.
807432800936796160 2016-12-09 03:52:35 UTC <erniwolf> Note: my post is a reflection on today's #fuckthisshit devo and not the actual post. Follow @tvrasche and @crazypastor for the real deal.

806677323894390784 2016-12-07 01:50:36 UTC <erniwolf> @Medium @KKoterwski @tvrasche @diakonia78 : It truly is. I am anxious to see where else transformation will happen.
806597800947568642 2016-12-07 20:34:36 UTC <erniwolf> I'm also grateful for the various Advent poetry I've come across, as well as meditations on the "O Antiphons". New ways to pray all around.
806597407261806593 2016-12-07 20:33:02 UTC <erniwolf> This #Advent devotional has challenged and comforted me in ways I hadn't expected. I am so grateful for those behind it. #fuckthisshithttps://twitter.com/tvrasche/status/806483496814276609

805067376974819328 2016-12-03 15:13:14 UTC <erniwolf> Day Seven by Tuhina Verma Rasche. Already re-read this a few times, and it packs a punch. #Advent #visceral https://medium.com/fuckthisshit/day-seven-9a64c528458f?source=twitterShare-704fa159aae9-1480777797
804900565801111552 2016-12-02 04:10:23 UTC <erniwolf> Asked at two stores if I was an employee because my keys are on a lanyard. Camp sweatshirt should've told them otherwise. #oops #camplife
804713263422390272 2016-12-02 15:46:07 UTC <erniwolf> @Medium : Yes, yes, yes. I hear you and am with you.
804713068437655552 2016-12-02 15:45:21 UTC <erniwolf> : Yes! Working in ministry, I am aware of what I say, but the #fuckthisshit writings are what I need for myself this season.
804693025192611840 2016-12-02 14:25:42 UTC <erniwolf> Note: New #twitter username: @erniwolf. Thanks to @M_StrongArm for a nickname that sticks. #youthministry #newname #typos #hashtagabuse
804691624370573312 2016-12-02 14:20:08 UTC <erniwolf> I will continue to dig deeper into the season and listen to the cries I relate to & those that leave me uncomfortable. May God hear all.
804690876672970752 2016-12-02 14:17:10 UTC <erniwolf> And for those made uncomfortable by strong language (which in other seasons I have also been): maybe we need to ask ourselves why we cringe.
804689824083013640 2016-12-02 14:12:59 UTC <erniwolf> If you are in a season where visceral language is the only way you can muster prayer, trust that God's love is bigger than your words.
804689530288803840 2016-12-02 14:11:49 UTC <erniwolf> In those times, my hurt ran so deep that I was at a loss for how else to pray. God's presence was deeply transformative then & remains now.
804689073994612737 2016-12-02 14:10:00 UTC <erniwolf> I share it simply because there have been times in my own life where visceral language was the only way I could pray.
804688833866563586 2016-12-02 14:09:03 UTC <erniwolf> For those reading my last tweet about a non-traditional Advent devotional, I do not intend to shock or offend.
804688568975233024 2016-12-02 14:07:59 UTC <erniwolf> Stay with me here: for visceral, raw reflections, read: #FuckThisShit  An Advent Devotional by Tuhina Verma Rasche https://medium.com/fuckthisshit/fuckthisshit-an-advent-devotional-b33fd0a79831#.st8iv05of

800774881797226496 2016-11-21 18:56:24 UTC <erniwolf> Today brings deeply-felt frustrations and pain for my fellow people. Acknowledging that hurt is necessary. Doing the work with it is, too.
800773708629549056 2016-11-21 18:51:44 UTC <erniwolf> In the midst of all that occurred in Standing Rock & Syria yesterday, glad to know Kanye, Gigi, and Kylie are trending. #sarcasm #priorities

783448772768595968 2016-10-04 23:28:37 UTC <erniwolf> I have to say, though, that it's hilarious the kids have been wanting extra snuggles lately. OH, HOW THE TABLES HAVE TURNED! #snarkysickmom
783448444832772096 2016-10-04 23:27:19 UTC <erniwolf> Sorry for whining just a moment ago. I really detest being sick with a passion. The world's tiniest violin can stop playing now. #whinewhine
783447662980890625 2016-10-04 23:24:13 UTC <erniwolf> The best part about being sick? Trick: There is no best part about being sick. C'mon immune system, let's kick things into high gear. #gross

778443897953333249 2016-09-20 04:01:02 UTC <erniwolf> More deaths. More destruction. More families wrenched apart. And all I can ask is that which Habakkuk asked, "How long, O Lord?"
776792999464493056 2016-09-16 14:40:57 UTC <erniwolf> @_Argus_Filch_ : Worry about your own drippy nose, Filch, and kindly keep it out of my business. Stop tweeting & finish cleaning. #toughghost
776674467774947328 2016-09-15 06:49:57 UTC <erniwolf> Still awake and throats feels like it's on fire. How unfortunate. Grateful for @theofficenbc and #RRHP for keeping me company.
764690379564314624 2016-08-13 05:09:28 UTC <erniwolf> Milwaukee family & friends: Please stay safe. #Milwaukee
764686836308578304 2016-08-13 04:55:23 UTC <erniwolf> It's official: @Lesdoggg is my favorite fan to follow during the #RioOlympics2016.
759906593580331008 2016-07-31 00:20:24 UTC <erniwolf> @mksclr : Such a painfully true observation.
759902149463666688 2016-07-31 00:02:45 UTC <erniwolf> Even with bumming kiddos, I'm grateful to have the week off from one job this week to lighten my load a little. #qualitytime ahead! #staycay
759901546385670144 2016-07-31 00:00:21 UTC <erniwolf> Hours into hubby being gone on a mission trip, and the kids are very bummed. I was told they miss me way less when I go to camp. #thankskids
755474259053600768 2016-07-19 18:47:54 UTC <erniwolf> I'm not sure if I'm more annoyed with the hurt hand or the kid who broke the stuff in the first place. Kid is cuter. #parenthood
755473270347104256 2016-07-19 18:43:58 UTC <erniwolf> I may have beat up my hand a bit, but I was still handy with a small repair in the kitchen today. #worstpuns #itreallyhurts #whinewhinewhine
754649876189868032 2016-07-17 12:12:05 UTC <erniwolf> : You're both on to something there. 
752167028358807552 2016-07-10 15:46:08 UTC <erniwolf> From Bishop Barbara Harris:https://twitter.com/revsusanrussell/status/752142305839099904
752165663230271488 2016-07-10 15:40:43 UTC <erniwolf> Agape. Unconditional love. Sacred and holy. Life-giving. Caritas. Love freely given to one another, even when it feels undeserved.
752164723857231872 2016-07-10 15:36:59 UTC <erniwolf> Loving others is a call to action. Let our actions be a reflection of love, hope, joy, light, and peace. Love without abandon.
752164446076801024 2016-07-10 15:35:53 UTC <erniwolf> Today, I ask you to join me in a quest to spread more love. Find an opportunity for an act of random kindness. Love is a verb.
752163685418819584 2016-07-10 15:32:51 UTC <erniwolf> This world desperately needs more love, hope, joy, light, and peace. We are created to be in communion with one another as beacons of love.
752163257977372672 2016-07-10 15:31:09 UTC <erniwolf> The love I experienced and witnessed this weekend among family and friends brought hope, joy, light, and peace.
752162927310958592 2016-07-10 15:29:51 UTC <erniwolf> What I've learned of myself: Love binds, heals, mends, repairs, and builds up. Love does not hurt, destroy, break, or tear down.
752162711979626496 2016-07-10 15:28:59 UTC <erniwolf> Love can sometimes feel unnatural in times of sorrow. When hurts run deep, we often cry out, "Where was the love?"
751155393439551488 2016-07-07 20:46:16 UTC <erniwolf> Kyrie eleison. Christe eleison. Kyrie eleison.
751151628351254528 2016-07-07 20:31:18 UTC <erniwolf> "Something is terribly wrong if the pain, sorrow, and outrage of a people makes you more uncomfortable than murder itself." @rupikaur_
750472312496001024 2016-07-05 23:31:57 UTC <erniwolf> @fr_christopher : Every time!
750471078456266753 2016-07-05 23:27:02 UTC <erniwolf> @fr_christopher : Your words ring with truth, brother. This is why I prefer to go with wit and terrible puns instead. ;) Groans over stings.
750470179063291904 2016-07-05 23:23:28 UTC <erniwolf> @fr_christopher : I can bring the snark when the mood strikes. At the moment, though, I'm in "recharging" mode. #staycation
750469242655563776 2016-07-05 23:19:45 UTC <erniwolf> @fr_christopher : So it seems. And I'm still without dazzling wit and charm to add to the masses.
750468557130100736 2016-07-05 23:17:01 UTC <erniwolf> Woof, it's been a while, Twitter.
733417576341098496 2016-05-19 22:02:31 UTC <erniwolf> Thankful for all the doctors, nurses, and other medical pros that keep patching my ragtag crew (and me) up. #antibioticstotherescue
729736534866468865 2016-05-09 18:15:22 UTC <erniwolf> Grateful and thankful today for those who offer their love and support to make chaos easier to handle. #thepoweroflove #helpinghands
727710268264992769 2016-05-03 04:03:42 UTC <erniwolf> @jtristanredding: I'm trying this whole putting myself 'out there' more, and it's strange. Ha! But seriously, you're a catalyst for change!

727615866829934592 2016-05-03 21:48:35 UTC <erniwolf> @aranwalter: I'm sorry y'all had to deal with that. It's a shame something relatively insignificant triggered nastiness.
726494584709222400 2016-04-30 19:33:01 UTC <erniwolf> "A new trump [card] I give you: love one another as I have loved you." -Jesus, illustrated by @FondduLacBish8. Happy day, @fr_christopher!
724073273110212608 2016-04-23 03:11:35 UTC <erniwolf> My prayers are with the family and friends of Amy Joyner-Francis tonight.
724046536947175424 2016-04-23 01:25:21 UTC <erniwolf> Well, hey howdy hey, @Todaki2! I hope your travels are going well this weekend, sir!

717758721825353729 2016-04-06 16:59:49 UTC <erniwolf> Pretty excited to be seeing @Nick_Offerman tomorrow for hubby's birthday. New book is part of the package. All sorts of winning.
715218232391700482 2016-03-30 16:44:49 UTC <erniwolf> Every day we work to make the world a better place is a day well spent. I am not a person of the tomb, but rather, a person of Resurrection.
715217844225634304 2016-03-30 16:43:16 UTC <erniwolf> With so much pain and heartbreak lately, having something to celebrate reminds me to continue to try to live fully.
715217277197619201 2016-03-30 16:41:01 UTC <erniwolf> My oldest is eight today, and the love pouring out from folks is tremendous. She's brought so much joy to so many already. #parenthood #love

705472392483753986 2016-03-03 19:18:20 UTC <erniwolf> Watching footage from @StationCDRKelly and his return to Earth has been amazing! My 1st grade self is going bonkers! #astronauts #DreamBig
704099443788877828 2016-02-28 00:22:43 UTC <erniwolf> Students shared about 30 Hour Famine experiences at church today, and the impact has already been powerful. #youthministry #BeTheChange

697804240375410689 2016-02-11 15:27:50 UTC <erniwolf> @barronvandeusen: Please. Just because I commented how great your new furniture looks from outside doesn't mean I'm following you. #creeping

690982812292349952 2016-01-23 19:41:54 UTC <erniwolf> @Websterzw is actually here in the flesh. First time since last June. It's a good day.
690982417667067906 2016-01-23 19:40:20 UTC <erniwolf> @fr_christopher: I read your intro sermon from earlier this month, and @FondduLacBish8 is open about his banana slug stories. #notacreeper
690797672320634880 2016-01-22 07:26:14 UTC <erniwolf> I've discovered that both @fr_christopher and @FondduLacBish8 have a mutual connection to banana slugs. #EpiscopalClergy, am I right? #slugs
690795140508688384 2016-01-22 07:16:10 UTC <erniwolf> Finally catching up with Twitter-verse... with @KyloR3n's amazing tweets. Seriously, all the laughs. I'm late to the party. #leaningintoit
