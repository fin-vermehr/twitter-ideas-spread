878619846665228289 2017-06-24 14:24:30 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Trumpcare will throw millions off health insurance. Trumpcare isn't the answer.
878416259859271681 2017-06-23 00:55:31 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump I thought it was a hoax?
878380275813806080 2017-06-23 22:32:31 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Trumpcare doesn't solve this problem. Reducing Medicaid funding doesn't solve this. Trumpcare isn't the answer. Do better.
878288685795561472 2017-06-23 16:28:35 UTC <1010jman> @TVietor08 But Sean and Sarah said they would consider their positions.
878059978153631744 2017-06-22 01:19:47 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Trumpcare makes draconian cuts to Medicaid. Another lie from a chronic liar.
878023707108687873 2017-06-22 22:55:39 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump It's a disaster. You and the @GOP are taking health insurance away from millions to give tax cuts to the rich.
877946158819270656 2017-06-22 17:47:30 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Why do you, President of the United States, appear to have much more twitter and tv time than I do?

877594207548002305 2017-06-21 18:28:58 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS @WhiteHouse Because you and the @GOP have sabotaged the marketplace by causing instability and delaying CSR payments. Trumpcare makes insurance worse.
877591907479801856 2017-06-21 18:19:50 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS @WhiteHouse Because premiums have gone up, you and @GOP will take health insurance away from 26 million Americans to give tax cuts to the rich.
877561403346956289 2017-06-21 16:18:37 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump So Dems should take health insurance away from millions of Americans to give tax cuts to the rich?

875712914539393027 2017-06-16 13:53:23 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump The investigation of you and your campaign is valid and justified.
875704356980625413 2017-06-16 13:19:23 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump If there's not collusion, why have you had no interest in punishing Russia for interfering in our election? Your actions scream guilty.

874707701342896132 2017-06-13 19:19:01 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS @VP How many millions will lose their insurance under Trumpcare so you and the @GOP can give tax cuts to the rich?
874693546565087232 2017-06-13 18:22:47 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS @VP Because you and the @GOP have undermined the marketplace with instability and doubt about whether cost sharing payments will be made.

874623255683969025 2017-06-13 13:43:28 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Why haven't you created more acceptable measures based on risk, not geography or religion? You've had ample time. Stop blaming others.
874616626527834113 2017-06-13 13:17:08 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump So I assume the AG Sessions and other DOJ members won't repeat this now.

856863026061987841 2017-04-25 13:30:39 UTC <1010jman> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump The actions of you, your administration and the @GOP aren't supportive of womem in the US or elsewhere in the world.
856572564495360002 2017-04-24 18:16:28 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump What's your plan? Neither you nor Congress have released a new plan. So what are you talking about?
856508314582212608 2017-04-24 14:01:10 UTC <1010jman> An independent prosecutor needs to be named. Such a serious event yet it's being minimized by partisan politics and pols with no courage.https://twitter.com/isikoff/status/856495690809311232
856484443934085120 2017-04-24 12:26:18 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Are you going to do anything about the Russian interference in our election?
856173509587984384 2017-04-23 15:50:46 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump I would rather see money spent on any domestic program before the ridiculous wall.
856173119647645697 2017-04-23 15:49:13 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump They will be paying some how, some amount, at some later unspecified date. We have your word on it. Even thought you lie constantly.
856160513063038976 2017-04-23 14:59:07 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump You and @GOP need to fund it or find an acceptable fix. You're the majority. It's your responsibility, not the Dems.
855873677363118080 2017-04-22 19:59:20 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Will you talk about the wall then ask who's going to pay for it so the crowd yells back MEXICO? It sounds better than the truth.
855862258043420673 2017-04-22 19:13:58 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Empty words. Nothing in your actions says you're committed to preserving the natural beauty of our nation. Your actions say the opposite.

855817507244060675 2017-04-22 16:16:08 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Or how you're reducing protections for working people, consumers and the environment. Good for business does not always mean good for all.
855816576305688576 2017-04-22 16:12:26 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump What do you think allies and enemies think when you quote or RT @foxandfriends? I'll tell you. The US President is an ignorant fool.

855430731090337795 2017-04-21 14:39:14 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt I don't want basic environmental protection. I want comprehensive and extensive environmental protection.
855411582502875136 2017-04-21 13:23:08 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Is China's North Korea problem the same as our North Korea problem? Them fixing their problem may not fix our problem.
855395471266914304 2017-04-21 12:19:07 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump You have accomplished one thing. You and your family have assembled the most crooked administration in history. Bigly crooked.
855383504670117888 2017-04-21 11:31:34 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump You've accomplished nothing because the majority despise you and your agenda. Which is why you lost the popular vote.

854329528268845056 2017-04-18 13:43:26 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Worried? You should be. People get pissed off when you try to take away their health insurance.
854145759352156163 2017-04-17 01:33:12 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt You should visit wind and solar companies. Industries that are larger than coal mining and represent the future of energy.
854134346978123776 2017-04-17 00:47:52 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Your constant need for affirmation is sad. I mean that in a you're pathetic way. Not in a I'm mocking you for ending tweets with SAD way.

852633708003766273 2017-04-13 21:24:51 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt Clean energy is the future. We should transition miners to clean energy instead of trying to support  a dying dirty industry.
852633212069326848 2017-04-13 21:22:53 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt You mean revise those pesky regulations so big business benefits at the expense of protecting the environment. Which is your job.

846875890109820929 2017-03-28 00:05:21 UTC <1010jman> Time to speak up @MassGovernorhttps://twitter.com/350malowell/status/846845308646686722
846872537602641921 2017-03-28 23:52:01 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Because Russia interfered in our election to help you at her expense. You and your campaign must be fully investigated.
846870933407174656 2017-03-28 23:45:39 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt Burdensome like SPCC regulations? Maybe go back to allowing oil spills in water bodies? That's less burden on business.
846784184114974720 2017-03-28 18:00:56 UTC <1010jman> @SpeakerRyan Investigate Russia interfering with our election
846761509464293376 2017-03-28 16:30:50 UTC <1010jman> @DanJWeiss My job is one of them. The environmental engineering, consulting and cleanup industry employs over 100,000 people.
846750202195316738 2017-03-28 15:45:54 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt Burdensome like UST regulations? Should we go back to when USTs at gas stations had catastrophic leaks?
846746267975847936 2017-03-28 15:30:16 UTC <1010jman> The failing @POTUS would do much better if he was honest! #hypocrite
846745713107259393 2017-03-28 15:28:04 UTC <1010jman> @CNN Why? Can you pick a @GOP mouthpiece who's not a racist? https://twitter.com/resnikoff/status/846696898346004480

846537527716646913 2017-03-27 01:40:49 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Lame couple of texts Don. If you want to distract people from your Russian corruption, you need to do better than this.
846535866877165571 2017-03-27 01:34:13 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Because they're looking at your connections to Russia. Because you're President, not them #CrookedDon
846507003648397314 2017-03-27 23:39:31 UTC <1010jman> This didn't get enough attentionhttps://twitter.com/wcvb/status/846368021476130817
846473773691887617 2017-03-27 21:27:29 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt Burdensome for the polluter. So they don't pollute. Helpful for environmental protection. Which is your job.
846123440134406144 2017-03-26 22:15:22 UTC <1010jman> Remember when America  used to support freedom? @POTUS @VP @GOPhttps://twitter.com/brucebartlett/status/846086092046716928

845982672803500033 2017-03-26 12:56:01 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS If Obamacare explodes, you and the @GOP Congress own it. You do realize that don't you?
845979273664118785 2017-03-26 12:42:31 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump I'm good with that.
845977588908593152 2017-03-26 12:35:49 UTC <1010jman> @SierraClub Apparently God should have stricter discharge limits for point and non-point sources of pollution with robust enforcement.
845785394939662341 2017-03-25 23:52:06 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Govern more. Campaign less.
845686497252691968 2017-03-25 17:19:07 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS @potus Doing more of the people's business are you? What happened to never leaving the White House because you'd be so busy?https://twitter.com/braddjaffy/status/845657825842024452
845669170394157057 2017-03-25 16:10:16 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump How about fixing and improving what we have before it explodes? That would be good leadership.
845646612424785920 2017-03-25 14:40:38 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Is that the 35 permanent jobs the State Dept says this project will create? Not worth the environmental damage.
845434576600289280 2017-03-24 00:38:05 UTC <1010jman> @altUSEPA But but but what about states rights? It should be up to states whether to allow air and water to travel.
845318106071339008 2017-03-24 16:55:16 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Wait. You're criticizing someone for not knowing the truth? HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA. Good one. @AP @JeffHorwitz
845307714830057474 2017-03-24 16:13:58 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Trumpcare is not a great plan
845290438307315714 2017-03-24 15:05:19 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Those are the biggest names? Not real compelling.
845276691614306308 2017-03-24 14:10:42 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt So California can set their own fuel economy standards without Washington getting in the way?

845074847151669249 2017-03-23 00:48:38 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Trumpcare is far worse. @GOP will pay the price.
844977967398895616 2017-03-23 18:23:41 UTC <1010jman> @liamstack @RenuZ Exactly
844956148507840513 2017-03-23 16:56:58 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS I don't support Trumpcare. @nikiinthehouse No ACHA please
844929995076227072 2017-03-23 15:13:03 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump You're a chronic liar. I'll assume your tweet means the reports of collusion with Russia are true and accurate.

844370589506785281 2017-03-21 02:10:10 UTC <1010jman> @feistybunnygirl I like when my daughter tweets me. Bet your dad does too.
844268524877086724 2017-03-21 19:24:36 UTC <1010jman> @nikiinthehouse Absolutely a national security issue. For the sake of every future election.
844248408638590976 2017-03-21 18:04:40 UTC <1010jman> @McFaul True but outrage about leaks can be selective by both parties
844192038434365441 2017-03-21 14:20:40 UTC <1010jman> @foxandfriends ....except for the FBI saying the Trump administration is under investigation.

842821457751261184 2017-03-17 19:34:29 UTC <1010jman> @jonfavs At least up until now. Don't underestimate our ability to embarrass ourselves.
842751622023446529 2017-03-17 14:56:58 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Diplomacy via tweet is a bad idea.

842418955545391104 2017-03-16 16:55:05 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Put America first. Support domestic programs. The military gets enough of our money.
842164257932341249 2017-03-15 00:03:00 UTC <1010jman> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. You lie all the time.
842133481903800320 2017-03-15 22:00:42 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt I see you saying pro-environment. I don't see pro-environment actions from you.
842082754254786565 2017-03-15 18:39:08 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt ...and then you'll do what's best for corporate profits.
842045345391620100 2017-03-15 16:10:29 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Your administration lies so much you have no credibility on anything. @GOP  is a willing partner.https://twitter.com/acosta/status/842038395652214785
842038513386291201 2017-03-15 15:43:20 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Meaning reduce fuel efficiency standards. Another gift to big business at the expense of public health.
842030177181962243 2017-03-15 15:10:13 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Don't you have better things to be doing? Did you know Russia broke an arms control treaty recently? Maybe a tweet about that?
842019060611203072 2017-03-15 14:26:02 UTC <1010jman> @rebleber @hannahjwaters @MotherJones A war on climate change would reduce climate change. @POTUS will make climate change worse.

842004645769797632 2017-03-15 13:28:45 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Do you know what would be fun? Explaining your connections to Russia!

841723087813005313 2017-03-14 18:49:57 UTC <1010jman> @Acosta Proud that Trumpcare will result in millions losing coverage? Or is this more of the 'don't take him literally'?
841671559219666944 2017-03-14 15:25:11 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Let's talk about Russia hacking our election. How about your campaign's ties to Russia? How about your conflicts of interests?
841446670839693312 2017-03-13 00:31:34 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS You always talk about what's wrong with Obamacare, not what's right about Trumpcare. Why is that?
841434880869314561 2017-03-13 23:44:43 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Are you cutting the budget of @NWS? Will their forecasts be less timely and accurate because of @NOAA budget cuts?
841410002329968642 2017-03-13 22:05:51 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS If Trumpcare is so good, why does it leave so many people uninsured. You said everyone would be covered. Were you lying again?
841393513245859840 2017-03-13 21:00:20 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Look at all those white men around the table. That must make @SteveKingIA happy.
841327231897088006 2017-03-13 16:36:57 UTC <1010jman> @BostonGlobe @MassSierraClub I agree with the writer that we don't want MassDEP to strictly operate in triage mode.
841281770955898882 2017-03-13 13:36:19 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS Trumpcare is a poor substitute. It needs to cover more people.
841281027976908800 2017-03-13 13:33:21 UTC <1010jman> @POTUS They're not your representatives. They work for us. Just like you do.

838871667476742144 2017-03-06 21:59:25 UTC <1010jman> Just a week ago @realDonaldTrump said US steel would be used for the Keystone pipeline. Except it's not. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/838862131852369922
838865335038197761 2017-03-06 21:34:15 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Why would I believe this? You lie constantly.

838502200536072192 2017-03-05 21:31:17 UTC <1010jman> @EricLiptonNYT Because why wouldn't we want more lead in surface soil and water?
838028019079999488 2017-03-04 14:07:04 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump It's an insignificant tv show. Russian hacking of our election is a national security problem.
838025273316638721 2017-03-04 13:56:09 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump @GOP We need to investigate the Russian hacking of our very sacred election. We need a special commission.
838024543818158080 2017-03-04 13:53:15 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Trying to deflect from the Russian hacking of our election?
838024063742259202 2017-03-04 13:51:21 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Did Obama's campaign conspire with Russia and benefit from election hacking? Did Obama lie under oath? Didn't think so.
838023207131152384 2017-03-04 13:47:56 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump Remember a few days ago when everyone was saying you looked all presidential? Now you just look unhinged.

837658608464715776 2017-03-03 13:39:09 UTC <1010jman> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @gop No the story is Russia hacked our election and your campaign had too many suspicious contacts with Russians
837653240149835776 2017-03-03 13:17:49 UTC <1010jman> @realDonaldTrump It would help if you nominated people who were even remotely qualified for their Cabinet positions.

836666889409552384 2017-02-28 19:58:25 UTC <1010jman> @EPAScottPruitt So farmers get permission to pollute more. How does this help other stakeholders? We get degraded surface water.
