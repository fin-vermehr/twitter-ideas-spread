920724392371507201 2017-10-18 18:52:56 UTC <susanecolasanti> As hour seven of jury duty (aka chair sitting) approaches, collective blood sugar slump in the room is running high. Someone is snoring.

886659735524712448 2017-07-16 18:52:08 UTC <susanecolasanti> I call them party cookies. Why? They are pretty and delicious and I take them home and have a private party except the cookies are invited.
886659454833491968 2017-07-16 18:51:02 UTC <susanecolasanti> Lets talk about these cookies by the pound at Whole Foods. You know, the ones that are dipped in chocolate and have sprinkles and things.

796221803689611266 2016-11-08 05:24:05 UTC <susanecolasanti> I know. We have to keep hope alive. I just have to believe there is more love than hate among us.
796217957571592192 2016-11-08 05:08:48 UTC <susanecolasanti> @kkaylanicole Ha! Seriously, my heart is still racing from fear. It was like I was in a horror movie...then horrified I wasn't.
796217673860390914 2016-11-08 05:07:41 UTC <susanecolasanti> Same. Only qualified politicians who are not racist misogynists should be allowed to run. Intelligence should also be required.
796217199413383168 2016-11-08 05:05:47 UTC <susanecolasanti> @pattycakess20 I was hoping we were smarter, kinder, and better than this. Still keeping hope alive...

796212153661394944 2016-11-08 04:45:44 UTC <susanecolasanti> @sarahdessen Heart. In. Pieces. Why did so many people vote for hate? We must be smarter, kinder, and better than this.
796211183900565504 2016-11-08 04:41:53 UTC <susanecolasanti> @starlaure Smart boy. Let's keep hope alive that hate will not win.
