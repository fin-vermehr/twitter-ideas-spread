936654976637702146 2017-12-01 17:55:23 UTC <2LiveDrewUF> There are enough sexual harassment stories every day to support a new #MeToo related email newsletter ("The #MeToo Moment") from the @nytimes.  This really drives home to me how widespread this issue is and how many victims are now able to come forward.

The law is murky about when someone commits a crime in another country and comes to the US. You are asking what happens when the person is NOT wanted for a crime in their country of origin. I dont know, tell me...
932673267751677952 2017-11-20 18:13:29 UTC <2LiveDrewUF> @bloodless_coup @Bobcat2603 I did answer: your question was based on a false premise.
932661650540384256 2017-11-20 17:27:20 UTC <2LiveDrewUF> @bloodless_coup @Bobcat2603 A)The Mexican law defining age of consent does not set it at 13, nor does it matter, because each Mexican state sets their own age. B)Mexican law allows anyone under 18 to file a complaint if consent was coerced by seduction and/or deceit, so guys like Moore go to jail there.
932653418996551680 2017-11-20 16:54:37 UTC <2LiveDrewUF> @bloodless_coup @Bobcat2603 No, but it sounds like you really want me to be.

929778131560534016 2017-11-12 18:29:15 UTC <2LiveDrewUF> @DavidJollyFL ND at No. 5, Auburn remains at No. 10? Did the AP voters WATCH those games? I guess I get Auburn with 2 losses, but they should have gained a couple spots for beating No. 1 by 3 TDs.
929509251579568129 2017-11-11 00:40:49 UTC <2LiveDrewUF> @JamesGrantFL True. Makes no sense for Mizzou to be in the East, swapping them with Auburn would bring some much-needed parity to the SEC.
929503463364587520 2017-11-11 00:17:49 UTC <2LiveDrewUF> @JamesGrantFL So true. If they expand to 9-game conference schedules I want Auburn.

Even if there was no criminal sexual contact, and it looks like there was, a 30something man pursuing a 14-year-old girl (or 16, 17, etc.) in any way is creepy, disturbing and disqualifying.

916375819144122369 2017-10-06 18:53:15 UTC <2LiveDrewUF> @TheLibertyTroll CCW is not a right like gun ownership, it is a privilege like your driver license. Waivers for  CCW and not for sick kids is backwards.
916374584156459010 2017-10-06 18:48:20 UTC <2LiveDrewUF> Absolutely not. Florida needs to put kids, especially sick ones, first. #IBackJack
