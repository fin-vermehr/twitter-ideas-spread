967827001422893056 2018-02-25 18:21:53 UTC <ndelgadillo07> At Governors Meeting, Guns Noticeably Absent From Agenda http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-gun-control-national-governors-association-winter-meeting.html
967519420682854406 2018-02-24 21:59:40 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Gov. Bevin of Kentucky: "If you're not asking your ERs to track information on how many people are coming in from an overdose, do it."
967517744810819585 2018-02-24 21:53:00 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Gov. Ducey of AZ is talking about unanimous legislation passed in the state that set time limits for opioid prescriptions:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-arizona-opiods/arizona-governor-signs-opioid-crackdown-legislation-idUSKBN1FF2O6
967516405544443913 2018-02-24 21:47:41 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Noam Levey of the @latimes is moderating the panel. Opens the discussion with a question on what governors are doing to affect the supply of opioids to their states.
967515608869933058 2018-02-24 21:44:31 UTC <ndelgadillo07> The other draft guidance is reexamining the conventional wisdom that addicts must be 100% clean in order for MAT to work.
967515356779642881 2018-02-24 21:43:31 UTC <ndelgadillo07> The FDA will soon release two new draft guidances that will increase access to MAT, Azar announces, including on on once-per-month buprenorphine injections (as opposed to daily injection of other types of MAT).
967514670876778498 2018-02-24 21:40:47 UTC <ndelgadillo07> "So what works? Medication-assisted treatment." The evidence on this is "voluminous and ever-growing," Azar says. Just 1/3 of treatment programs offer MAT, & he says HHS is dedicated to bringing that number up.
967513124546011137 2018-02-24 21:34:39 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Alex Azar, newly confirmed Sec. of HHS, is speaking now. Feds are not "on the front lines" of this fight, he says.
967512193943076870 2018-02-24 21:30:57 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon says there has been an overemphasis on punishment in dealing with the opioid crisis. #WeTheStates
967511425496309762 2018-02-24 21:27:53 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Baker says they're looking to certify "recovery coaches," people in recovery themselves who help others overcome their opioid addictions. There have been concerns about unqualified people peddling themselves as coaches in the state.
967510472265228294 2018-02-24 21:24:06 UTC <ndelgadillo07> The state increased spending by 60% on addiction-based programs and added "1100 beds." Also upped efforts on education & prevention.
967510033914384388 2018-02-24 21:22:22 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts opens up the session. In 2017, he says, opioid prescriptions were reduced, overdoses and deaths leveled off.  But, he clarifies, there's a long way to go. This is a "muted success."
967507739483279360 2018-02-24 21:13:15 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Final plenary session of the day at @NatlGovsAssoc winter meeting. On the opioid crisis. Follow along for tweets & highlights!pic.twitter.com/c0yMiLnSgb

967425703296847872 2018-02-24 15:47:16 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @NatlGovsAssoc More on the importance of trade and U.S.-Aus. cooperation. We know that America first does not mean America alone, Turnbull says.

967422787676725248 2018-02-24 15:35:41 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @NatlGovsAssoc Turnbull is now discussing the TransPacific Partnership, says keeping it alive maintains an option for the U.S. to return in the future.
967422153766375430 2018-02-24 15:33:09 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @NatlGovsAssoc We understand that America expects others to pull their weight, Turnbull says.
967421477803974659 2018-02-24 15:30:28 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @NatlGovsAssoc He thanked President Trump and Melania for their warm welcome on his arrival in D.C.

866397015143567360 2017-05-21 20:55:19 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @HolocaustMuseum @ClohertyWTOP If it's been lifted why are we still trapped here
866396332495384576 2017-05-21 20:52:37 UTC <ndelgadillo07> People are getting pissed and restless, telling the officers their rights are being violated
866396202480357377 2017-05-21 20:52:06 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Currently trapped inside the Holocaust Museum because only women and children are being allowed out & we have a guy in our group

864202059867926533 2017-05-15 19:33:21 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @katemshepherd But what REALLY gets me is the way men will be so convinced you OWE them your attention. And when I say "no go away"...
864201774642712576 2017-05-15 19:32:13 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @katemshepherd Yeah it is annoying, insulting, sometimes mildly frightening
864199896567619589 2017-05-15 19:24:46 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @katemshepherd Leave it to men in bars to say YOU are being rude after they have repeatedly come into your space uninvited for 3 hrs
864199563099467776 2017-05-15 19:23:26 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @katemshepherd Esp because one man in particular had the nerve to look shocked and say "don't yell at me!" After his FOURTH time bothering us
864198027153723392 2017-05-15 19:17:20 UTC <ndelgadillo07> I don't know why I am surprised or how I have the energy to still muster anger about this stuff (but yes, I'm still mad @katemshepherd)
864197720902443008 2017-05-15 19:16:07 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Went out with @katemshepherd this past Saturday, and we were ENDLESSLY harassed for like 4 hrs, just sitting quietly @ a neighborhood bar
864197323429216256 2017-05-15 19:14:32 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Turns out I just haven't been out without a male friend practically the whole time I've lived here, which has shielded me/made me delusional
864197095938547714 2017-05-15 19:13:38 UTC <ndelgadillo07> For like 1.5 year, I've been telling friends back home that harassment on D.C. streets and in D.C. bars is not as bad as in L.A.

704120350800482305 2016-02-28 01:45:48 UTC <ndelgadillo07> I have a lot of feelings about that monologue & im not sure what all of them are yet
703471970436907008 2016-02-26 06:49:22 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @femmeilys they're telling ppl that now
703442591371493376 2016-02-26 04:52:37 UTC <ndelgadillo07> No matter who leaves you, or how you're betrayed, there is a place inside yourself to come home to. That's a powerful thing to understand
703441753731272704 2016-02-26 04:49:18 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Of a divorce sound so at-peace and strong and proud even while she's obviously hurt. There is life after loss (2)
703441537221308417 2016-02-26 04:48:26 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Jen Garner's Vanity Fair interview was kind of world-shifting for me. That sounds stupid but it was so cool to see a woman in the middle (1)
703349432058843136 2016-02-26 22:42:26 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Mexico City Officials Are Shaming Litterbugs and Parking Hogs on Periscope, and People Love It http://www.citylab.com/crime/2016/02/mexico-city-officials-are-shaming-litterbugs-and-parking-hogs-on-periscope-and-people-love-it/471036/
703242720014417920 2016-02-26 15:38:24 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Was I the only person who was IMMEDIATELY like, "wow this guy's a worm"
703242617107120129 2016-02-26 15:38:00 UTC <ndelgadillo07> I keep reading all these reviews of Love that are like, "it was so surprising & interesting when Gus turned out to be not-that-nice!"
702562214759129088 2016-02-24 18:34:19 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @kevinbtruong the same annoying. One of the creators used to write for Girls, if that tells you anything
702497089729622016 2016-02-24 14:15:32 UTC <ndelgadillo07> confirms my suspicions that there is a populous contingent of this country that is cruel and insanehttps://twitter.com/kevinbtruong/status/702360335584514049
701593118869688321 2016-02-21 02:23:29 UTC <ndelgadillo07> In episode 7, Mickey offers Gus an assortment of beverages and he chooses MILK. Milk. I rest my case
701588965850271745 2016-02-21 02:06:59 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Mickey has a redemptive arc. She's shitty and an addict but she's kind and interesting and compelling as a human. Gus is a wet rag
701582450145816576 2016-02-21 01:41:05 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Also, I'm only on episode 6, but so far I remain unconvinced that Gus's character can possibly have a redemptive arc.
701580677523886080 2016-02-21 01:34:02 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Like I started watching this show because I was like "wow these are places in LA that I know!" But this is like a freaky, pasty LA
701579620747968512 2016-02-21 01:29:50 UTC <ndelgadillo07> You could have cast one of them. Or at least showed one of them on screen at one point.
701578926460706817 2016-02-21 01:27:05 UTC <ndelgadillo07> I guess it is Echo Park but like MANY brown people live there, Judd Apatow
701578109573853185 2016-02-21 01:23:50 UTC <ndelgadillo07> And it's not exactly that I'm NOT interested. But there's not even a token-friend POC?
701576473694629888 2016-02-21 01:17:20 UTC <ndelgadillo07> So that Netflix show Love is pretty good if you're really interested in the lives of dozens of Echo Park white people
700752145667248132 2016-02-19 18:41:45 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @alexandra_tash right?? It's like the fanciest gas station ever, why is it children's-book themed?
700697561959571456 2016-02-19 15:04:51 UTC <ndelgadillo07> I miss LA
700697474093088768 2016-02-19 15:04:30 UTC <ndelgadillo07> Where's my meet-cute?
700697222329937920 2016-02-19 15:03:30 UTC <ndelgadillo07> I have ALSO tried to haggle with the attendant at that EXACT weird Dr. Seuss gas station in Echo Park.https://youtu.be/Ym3LoSj9Xj8
700692062308401152 2016-02-19 14:43:00 UTC <ndelgadillo07> sometimes i think i could be the kind of person that wakes up at 5 am to attend a yoga class before work. always wrong
700017730850844672 2016-02-17 18:03:27 UTC <ndelgadillo07> @joseph_petrotta lmao. I need you to live with me and help me adult. Literally CANT get up early, it's just not in me
700003258086117376 2016-02-17 17:05:56 UTC <ndelgadillo07> or is that just like, being an adult
700003084542595079 2016-02-17 17:05:15 UTC <ndelgadillo07> is there a class you can take where they teach you to get out of bed on time
