Unfortunately the bears that run our factory are emaciated and unproductively sluggish due to global warming.  We're honestly grateful our seltzer doesn't taste like hot dog water.

928508300148256769 2017-11-08 06:23:24 UTC <SerraoBryan> @bridgetbardeau When he hosted SNL as himself and played the musical guest as "Chris Gaines" I vowed to fight him on the street should our Heavenly Father provide such an omnipotent opportunity

877760520706719744 2017-06-21 05:29:50 UTC <SerraoBryan> Theory: Larry David is secretly directing and producing the WH Press Secretary briefings
872648769329913856 2017-06-07 02:57:34 UTC <SerraoBryan> It's high time a savvy television executive gives Steve Harvey the overdue hosting opportunity he so justly deserves.

840752862326054912 2017-03-11 02:34:37 UTC <SerraoBryan> I have concerns that with daylight saving time approaching Donald might relish in the confusion and set the clocks back to pre abolishment.
835662445985300481 2017-02-25 01:27:07 UTC <SerraoBryan> Donald has decided not to attend the White House Correspondents' Dinner after realizing Yakov Smirnoff is unavailable.

784621910571290625 2016-10-07 05:10:15 UTC <SerraoBryan> Theory: Donald is clandestinely introducing gangster rap to the white supremacist community to unite the masculine masses.  Sorry ladies
755967994019348480 2016-07-20 03:29:49 UTC <SerraoBryan> It might be wise to get a hold of as many DVD's of Aladdin as we can before Donald orders them burned with all copies of the Quran.
747929361953755136 2016-06-28 23:07:10 UTC <SerraoBryan> The visual of Pat Summitt giving Buddy Ryan a wedgie in front of St. Peter has gotten me through this Monday.

720858307284471809 2016-04-14 06:16:28 UTC <SerraoBryan> Is there a loophole where we can nominate Ted Cruz's daughter?  Maybe if only for the Donald debate.
