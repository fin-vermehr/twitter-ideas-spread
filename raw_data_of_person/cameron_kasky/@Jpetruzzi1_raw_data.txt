970835842322219008 2018-03-05 01:37:56 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @JuddLegum @MrAlexNiceGuy @lovinbebemocha Youre forgetting that the bigger the scam, the lighter the consequences. Like thieves patting other thieves on the back for a mighty show of corruption.
970823958923800576 2018-03-05 00:50:43 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @Emma4Change @TedDeutch Congrats you guy! Good first step!

970073249714397184 2018-03-03 23:07:40 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @thehill @waltshaub People like Nunes always have a reckoning. They always get tripped up by their own lies and deceit. All hes getting now is a little more than his fifteen minutes. Hell always be not much more than a backbencher.
969236679570542592 2018-03-01 15:43:26 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @MSNBC Theyre both lapdogs

966697578657021958 2018-02-22 15:33:57 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @AshaRangappa_ It sounds to me like the NRA is using MSDHS shooting as an excuse to institute a long cherished goal: more guns in school. 17 children dead and the NRA still wins. Smh
966694689180037120 2018-02-22 15:22:28 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @MSNBC No we just hate the NRA and you specifically.

964319660656099328 2018-02-15 02:04:57 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @MSNBC One day Wayne LaPierre, Marco Rubio and the rest of the NRA welfare queens will be gone. What will they tell god when She asks them how they helped people? Think about it.

962508816968380416 2018-02-10 02:09:19 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @kenolin1 @Govna You realize Session and Rosenstein are Trumps people right? The guys running the Russia investigation are Trump appointees.

925416991615205376 2017-10-31 17:39:38 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @MSNBC Sadly theres tons of Americans who will believe Russia over an American prosecutor and grand jury and judge. Sad day.

914635775232188416 2017-10-01 23:38:56 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @SNFonNBC The flag is a symbol NOT THE SUBSTANCE of our freedoms. #TakeAKnee
914566954236522497 2017-10-01 19:05:28 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @realDonaldTrump Because youve been so successful so far? Lol 
914279795831087104 2017-09-30 00:04:24 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @realDonaldTrump Trumpets will never understand conviction. Only empty platitudes about patriotism. Theyre not real Republicans. SAD!

912732110347059200 2017-09-26 17:34:27 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @NBCPolitics Does Jeff Sessions even have any credibility anymore? Who cares what he thinks.
912727852310601728 2017-09-26 17:17:32 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @realDonaldTrump Nationalism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.
912714433721335808 2017-09-26 16:24:13 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @NBCNews What response?

912136120292433920 2017-09-24 02:06:12 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @nytimes No they're not Al Qaeda. They're far more dangerous.
912124871508770816 2017-09-24 01:21:30 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @soonergrunt @pjl1015 @kylenabecker I'd rather keep my liberty and lose the song and flag than keep them and lose my liberty!

912032937528385536 2017-09-24 19:16:11 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @DavidCornDC He'd have been drummed out of the GOP by this bunch years ago.
912012836548653056 2017-09-24 17:56:19 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @realDonaldTrump You realize of course that every tweet makes you less and less relevant right?
911615186401763328 2017-09-23 15:36:12 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @amjoyshow Awesome interview with HRC! She should be POTUS...
911394747410825216 2017-09-22 01:00:15 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @NBCNews Then why didn't you?
911089141252628481 2017-09-21 04:45:53 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @KamalaHarris Learned more on this tonight on TV. It's an abomination pitting sick people against other sick people. Shameful.
910978259726168064 2017-09-21 21:25:16 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @RightWingWatch Who is Ann Coulter and why should we care what he thinks?

910506865485684736 2017-09-20 14:12:07 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @MSNBC I fear this one will pass. Right now Repubs are in party over country/policy mode right now.
910502726496223232 2017-09-20 13:55:40 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @AmbJohnBolton @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You're both warmongering hate filled monsters. Go to hell...

908546046191529984 2017-09-14 04:20:32 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @MSNBC HRC also STILL got 3 million more votes. 
908545811574800384 2017-09-14 04:19:36 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @MSNBC I wonder how many of you self appntd critics saw the interview or God forbid have read her book.
908202095173443584 2017-09-13 05:33:47 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @HamillHimself @realDonaldTrump She got 3 million more votes than he did. Trump=fact averse.

906651977693634560 2017-09-09 22:54:10 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @thehill HRC: Fully investigated, fully exonerated.
906651605902147584 2017-09-09 22:52:42 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @thehill I find it interesting that ppl want HRC investigation reopened as Trump's investigation is heating up. Deflecting mayhap?

897274819141525504 2017-08-14 01:52:42 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @MSNBC Trump is his own kind of smear.
897249052751912960 2017-08-14 00:10:18 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @cnnbrk What does this have to do with anything? HRC didn't plagiarize.
897248296120352768 2017-08-14 00:07:18 UTC <Jpetruzzi1> @thehill Maybe you're the bad guy here?
