971883702916714497 2018-03-08 23:01:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ReedRobertson Sorry to hear that....thankfully, my reasons for returning aren't to that level of seriousness.
971879939870994439 2018-03-08 22:46:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @ReedRobertson Delconte is a new AD, and he simply isn't going to take the risk. Also, it's very possible Davis took the $1500.

971756637638791173 2018-03-08 14:36:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BillKristol This jackass went to Dartmouth, FFS. He's actively ignoring his Ivy League education.

971610292173099008 2018-03-07 04:55:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @jeffchaley That too....
971610168004939776 2018-03-07 04:54:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @JonRothstein They have won 3 of their last 4 without 3 of their top 6 players. Do you mean limping because of those players missing?
971609672728940545 2018-03-07 04:52:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @jeffchaley The lack of off-ball player movement, especially against zone, makes me want to bash my head against a wall.

971608023671156738 2018-03-07 04:46:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattmosley They showed that during the game.
971607621303226368 2018-03-07 04:44:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Any team that can effectively run zone can stagnate and frustrate the Texas offense. That is more on the coach than the players, IMO.
971607141713960961 2018-03-07 04:42:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 My biggest criticism of Shaka right now is his half-court offensive sets.
971606900675698688 2018-03-07 04:41:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @ReedRobertson I think Texas should activate Davis and let the chips fall, but Delconte won't operate that way.
971606647687860224 2018-03-07 04:40:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I think Texas is a 10 seed right now
971605858927955968 2018-03-07 04:37:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Definitely, but he almost lost it by reverting on offense.
971601721947500544 2018-03-07 04:21:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 But Shaka HAS TO make zone adjusments to his offense.....
971601589571026944 2018-03-07 04:20:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Texas' guards are driving me insane

971588238417780736 2018-03-07 03:27:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP @johnpwalker1 Bottom line is, it's the overall resume. OSU's resume, especially in non-conf, isn't as good as others. I still think they need to win tomorrow to feel good.
971587872930353157 2018-03-07 03:26:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP @johnpwalker1 Ok, so 1 RPI has them at 69.....when every other RPI has them lower, that ain't exactly quality, especially with the quadrant system the committee is using this year.
971587366174511104 2018-03-07 03:24:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 For Texas, it's both
971587168111079425 2018-03-07 03:23:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP @johnpwalker1 Not in the 3 different ones I looked at....Kenpom, Jerry Palm, and the RPI on the NCAA's website.
971586855069257728 2018-03-07 03:22:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 A lot of the misses in the last 10 minutes were open looks
971586627045863425 2018-03-07 03:21:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Finally hit a couple of open 3s as well as DO getting inside....  And the defense REALLY picked up in the last 5 minutes....
971586332089872384 2018-03-07 03:20:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP @johnpwalker1 Where are you seeing Tulsa in the top 70?
971584539565969408 2018-03-07 03:13:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP @johnpwalker1 Florida State and?
971583416507486210 2018-03-07 03:08:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP @johnpwalker1 They won one of them, and those 5 games don't offset the garbage in the other games
971581005189599232 2018-03-07 02:58:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP @johnpwalker1 Yes
971579413442768896 2018-03-07 02:52:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 We're getting bad Dylan so far....
971577363757764608 2018-03-07 02:44:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP @RollsRoyce57 Maybe....maybe not. If they win tomorrow, I'll agree with you.
971575218358583297 2018-03-07 02:35:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 @WillBaizer It was a joke....you two kind of look alike.
971574969477029889 2018-03-07 02:34:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP @bclev711 As I said earlier, the whole resume matters. OSU's NC SOS is going to be a big hindrance to them. They need to beat Kansas again to secure a spot, IMO.
971574442378825728 2018-03-07 02:32:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer @josephcook89 Which one of you & Will was given up for adoption in favor of the other?
971572526806597632 2018-03-07 02:25:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP Bottom line is, the whole resume matters.....
971572345985994752 2018-03-07 02:24:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP OSU can get in, definitely, but I don't think they're in yet. OU should be worried that they won't....
971571652663414784 2018-03-07 02:21:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 Is Bamba available or is he out?
971571215818264577 2018-03-07 02:20:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP Their terrible non-conf schedule matters, SVP. They need to beat Kansas again to secure a spot, IMO.
971568074582298624 2018-03-07 02:07:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> Ok, OSU winning now DOES make it a lot more interesting.....
971560348317831173 2018-03-07 01:36:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @Bitterwhiteguy @jeffchaley The Azubwuike injury potentially just made the Big 12 tournament a lot more interesting.

971479358132178944 2018-03-07 20:15:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer To be fair, I think a lot of those people are saying he shouldn't play and risk further injury....not that he doesn't want to play or is using it as an excuse not to.

971100859147964416 2018-03-06 19:11:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NCAA @luke_emberton I agree, but @ncaa rules prevent UT from doing so.
971098979491614720 2018-03-06 19:03:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @luke_emberton They aren't allowed too....see previous tweet.
971098851145912320 2018-03-06 19:03:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @luke_emberton Because even though doctors believe Andrew's broken wrist that occurred about a month before his diagnosis may have led to his contracting Leukemia, they cannot prove direct causation. Therefore, it doesn't qualify as a "sport-related injury".
971098179558100994 2018-03-06 19:00:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @luke_emberton In Andrew's case, this is incorrect.

971097406791192576 2018-03-06 18:57:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NCAA @rex_rexchapman If not for the rules of the @ncaa, Andrew could/would have had the costs of his battle with Leukemia completely covered with the stroke of a pen via a check. Instead, UT's only option was to set up an internet fundraising page and ask the public to help.
971095064666624000 2018-03-06 18:48:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DrewdotCash @rex_rexchapman (2/2) How far do you think $10k gets you in paying for Leukemia treatment? (Hint: Not very far)  Now, if he were considered an employee (in some form) he would have access to medical insurance benefits through UT that would help cover these costs.
971094420597690369 2018-03-06 18:45:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman Let's use a current example for this young man as to why that isn't suffiecient....Andrew Jones at The University of Texas. @DrewdotCash   Because of the way the system i ls currently set up, UT is prevented from financially assisting him in his battle with Leukemia. (1/2)
971084108716748801 2018-03-06 18:04:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman And when did this person play? Relevant point in this discussion....

970511131352686592 2018-03-04 04:07:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF @MBHORNSFAN The good thing is, I think @_delconte understands that the almighty dollar can't be the primary focus if you want to really create a great atmosphere for college sports.
970508252919320579 2018-03-04 03:56:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RD3tx @MBHORNSFAN Oh ok
970507967299837952 2018-03-04 03:55:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RD3tx @MBHORNSFAN Some of the people in LF have season tickets, so GTFOH with that garbage.
970507535798210560 2018-03-04 03:53:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RD3tx Let's not compare the two, please. They're not comparable.
970506750368665601 2018-03-04 03:50:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RD3tx If/when their prices become reasonable, I may come to your side.

970492951871836161 2018-03-04 02:55:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ScotPollard31 People in this day & age who cling to the "free education" argument as to why college athletes shouldn't be paid are not dissimilar from those who argued against civil right using the "that's just the way things are" point of view.

967664486671896576 2018-02-24 07:36:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BlaireDad It does make sense. You give them a choice. Go pro out of HS or go to college for at least 2 years. Their decision, no one else's.....

967661419838758912 2018-02-24 07:23:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BlaireDad Then don't go to college.
967661083996688384 2018-02-24 07:22:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BlaireDad Please read.....
967660951519596550 2018-02-24 07:22:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BlaireDad I never said they shouldn't get paid.
967660794472288256 2018-02-24 07:21:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BlaireDad I most certainly do not. I also agreed that players should get paid while in college. The bottom line is with my idea the players have a choice, which they currently don't.
967658368558157824 2018-02-24 07:11:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BlaireDad The problem of forcing kids who don't want/need to play college ball to do so.
967657751752204288 2018-02-24 07:09:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BlaireDad This, I compeletely agree with....
967657673394216961 2018-02-24 07:09:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BlaireDad Well, 1st...I would have it be 2 years, not 3. What this would do is allow those who can/want to go pro out of HS to do so, but if kids do decide to go to college, they are committing to at least 2 years. It's the best of both worlds.

967641690235383808 2018-02-24 06:05:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH All of your arguments have been legal ones.
967641545997520897 2018-02-24 06:04:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH We have to be playing the same game for me to "Take the L". You never did make it to my playing field, despite my attempts to get you here.

967640715198156800 2018-02-24 06:01:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH In a court of law? No, it isn't....but in society? It most certainly does....  This is the point you kept missing. I was never making a legal argument or point.
967640028045299712 2018-02-24 05:58:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH My suggestion to you is that you occasionally poke your head up out of your law books and out of the courtroom so that you can understand the larger points and see the bigger pictures that people make.
967639490872463361 2018-02-24 05:56:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH I never claimed that the NRA beared direct responsibility for this tragedy, nor did I claim that they beared legally actionable responsibility that could be proven in a court of law. However, that does not mean that they bear no responsibility, on any level, for what happened.
967638589080293376 2018-02-24 05:53:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Responsibility can be assigned both directly and indirectly. There can also be levels of responsibility. One can bear responsiblity, even if it is a smaller portion than another party bears.
967638009679097858 2018-02-24 05:50:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH I also never made any sort of inference to "legally actionable" responsibility.
967637423676157952 2018-02-24 05:48:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Saying "This list includes...." implies that those named were part of the list, but not all of it. Also, I made no inference as to what level of, or directness of, responsibility any of those I named beared.
967636514711711744 2018-02-24 05:44:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH I said that "there were many groups and indviduals that bear responsibility for this" outside of the person who holds the ultimate responsibility, the shooter. Then I said "This list includes...."
967635686370304002 2018-02-24 05:41:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH No, you didn't.....but here, I will clear it up even further so that there is zero ambiguity. Please bear with me, as I apparently have to go step by step here.....
967635317749702656 2018-02-24 05:40:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH You are correct about that last part.
967635049800757251 2018-02-24 05:39:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Lol.....still not getting it.

967634100252217344 2018-02-24 05:35:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH I have continued this conversation in the hopes that you would get your mind out of your law books and the courtroom so that you might then see the point I was making, but that still has yet to occur.
967633541017292800 2018-02-24 05:33:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH I am aware of the definition, thanks....
967633390580195330 2018-02-24 05:32:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Yet you are....cute artwork, though.
967632816904302592 2018-02-24 05:30:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Yeah, really....
967632660293148674 2018-02-24 05:29:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Actually, there is....if you read what I wrote again, very carefully (minus the idiotic grammatical error), you just might get it.
967632345107959808 2018-02-24 05:28:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Despite your assertions, no lizard exists.
967632142531481600 2018-02-24 05:27:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH This case is about many things....and how, exactly, are you going to stop me?
967629741179236352 2018-02-24 05:18:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH And no, I didn't....not even kind of.
967629500854013953 2018-02-24 05:17:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH I won't
967629395564335104 2018-02-24 05:16:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH I don't want this case to be about anything. I don't want it to exist, but it does....and what is amazing to me is that in this whole discussion, you have yet to understand the original point I was making.
967628219976429568 2018-02-24 05:11:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH They really aren't, but you are helping me. Believe me....
967627979793883137 2018-02-24 05:11:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Not a thing, but again....I didn't say they did, in regards to what is in this piece.
967627777183768576 2018-02-24 05:10:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Nothing, from what I can gather.....but I didn't say they did in this case of what in in this article.
967626520557735936 2018-02-24 05:05:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH The NRA is anything but imaginary.....
967624818173579264 2018-02-24 04:58:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Agree to disagree, but evidence in this instance is on my side.
967624597901402112 2018-02-24 04:57:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RamsNFL @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Yet you keep typing that.....
967624493895241729 2018-02-24 04:57:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RamsNFL @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Interesting....are they aware that they have free reign to do whatever they feel like doing?
967623333297651712 2018-02-24 04:52:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Same list, yes....but that was the extent of it. However, they most certainly do belong on it.
967622996293808128 2018-02-24 04:51:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RamsNFL @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH So, you're telling me that laws have no effect over how or what law enforcement agencies can or can't do?
967622567291957248 2018-02-24 04:49:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RamsNFL @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Could you provide a definition of what a bogeyman is? You keep mentioning this term....
967622247648243712 2018-02-24 04:48:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH No....I really didn't. I never stated levels of responsibility, nor did I state that they were all equally responsible.
967621576609943552 2018-02-24 04:45:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TopherSpiro Don't jinx this....
967614366148366336 2018-02-24 04:16:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Cognitive dissonance, indeed.....
967614132903186433 2018-02-24 04:16:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @browardsheriff @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Actually, that isn't what I think. If you had actually bothered reading what I wrote, you woumd know that.
967613893790060545 2018-02-24 04:15:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RamsNFL @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH I need to take the LSAT to know the influence the NRA has had over laws in this country when it comes to guns?
967612548848775170 2018-02-24 04:09:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @prettymansc @SAS9366 Side note: There is nothing in the Bill of Rights that protects the profits of gun manufacturers.  Continue....
967611765440811008 2018-02-24 04:06:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @prettymansc @SAS9366 What rights did I suggest eliminating?
967611525400879104 2018-02-24 04:05:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Ah yes, and they have had no influence over the guns laws in our country, which affect what law enforcement agencies can and can't do in regards to intervention.....none at all.
967610949074083842 2018-02-24 04:03:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @prettymansc @SAS9366 Again, I don't personally feel that way, but your stream of consciousness here is quite intruiging.

967610083206197249 2018-02-24 03:59:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH I don't know what a bogeyman is (a golf goblin, maybe?), but the NRA is a lobbying group.
967609799872602113 2018-02-24 03:58:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @prettymansc @SAS9366 Ah, so you're admitting it's all about profit for the gun manufacturers. Glad I was able to make you see the light....

967607843816919040 2018-02-24 03:51:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @SoCalCMH Or study the history of the NRA and gun laws across America.....

967607031317319682 2018-02-24 03:47:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @prettymansc @SAS9366 Especially when you completely bastardize its intended meaning, and use that made-up meaning to further the agenda of gun manufacturers so that they can sell as many guns as possible, thereby increasing their profit margins.
967604251445940224 2018-02-24 03:36:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NRA @BarkingCarnival @ChrisJNFL My grinding axe isn't imaginary. This isn't all about them, but to act like it has zero to do with them is ignorant.
967603404909531136 2018-02-24 03:33:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @prettymansc And lawmaker breakdown....local and national.
967601271594274817 2018-02-24 03:24:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA Just to clear things up....there are MANY groups & individuals who bear responsiblity for what happened, outside of the psychopath, who the ultimately bears responsiblity. They include the FBI,  local authorities, state & federal politicians, and yes....the NRA.

967547747904770049 2018-02-24 23:52:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kbohls I am a fan of Del Conte, but ADs & coaches won't get on board because it will cause their salaries to go down. University President won't because it will cut into how much of the pie their schools get. This will have to be decided in court, eventually.
967539282444537856 2018-02-24 23:18:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @washingtonpost @CPAC has lost all credibility as an organization. They are literally a conference for crazies.

966909355034476544 2018-02-22 05:35:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @CeddyB012 I agree that they drift out too much, but you lost me with the idiocy of the rest of this tweet.
966908888992772096 2018-02-22 05:33:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @CeddyB012 I've watched every game. What you are describing is what happened last night, but not every game. They do struggle against teams that can run zone defenses effectively, which is when their offense becomes stagnant, mainly because they can't consistently shoot a team out of a zone
966907756497154054 2018-02-22 05:29:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CeddyB012 @thelonghorns12 There are issues with both, but yes....less about scheme.
966907148172124161 2018-02-22 05:26:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @CeddyB012 Extreme like having a losing season next year.
966906766955921409 2018-02-22 05:25:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @CeddyB012 (2/2) His 2 best shooters aren't on the team. One of then is battling Leukemia. The other had to be kicked off the team and transferred because he became a selfish locker room cancer.
966906252881100800 2018-02-22 05:23:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @CeddyB012 The backup bigs are freshmen. Febres & Coleman are Freshmen. Davis & Roach weren't his recruits. Now, while Banks was viewed as a project, he obviously hasn't progressed. Young was a shooter coming out of HS, but obviously hasn't found it here. Those two misses are on Shaka (1/2)
966905001468555265 2018-02-22 05:18:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JasonMinnix They won't cut him, but they will try to push him into a re-structuring.
966904126335414273 2018-02-22 05:14:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @CeddyB012 Does he have 4 or 5 years left on his contract after this one?
966903848215265280 2018-02-22 05:13:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CeddyB012 @thelonghorns12 I think you will see growth from the other freshman bigs as well.
966903560918073344 2018-02-22 05:12:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CeddyB012 @thelonghorns12 There are extreme circumstances, of course, but most-likely at least 2 more seasons.

966903022377877504 2018-02-22 05:10:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @CeddyB012 He gets 2 more years.

966517674422538242 2018-02-21 03:39:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Shaka needs to make some kind of half court offensive adjustment. There is little to no player movement, so everything stagnates if there's no driving lane for the ball-handler.

966143984484651008 2018-02-20 02:54:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JulianCastro @ChrisMosser When do you guys record and may I attend?
966141716003721216 2018-02-20 02:45:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 This is true. As you know, it's hardly an exact science to be able to predict how guys are going to turn out, but it's obvious that Shaka and his staff did not properly evaluate Mack mental failings.
966140875867869184 2018-02-20 02:41:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Well, I don't know how much of that is on Shaka. However, things like not being sure he had a point guard last year and the fact that guys like Banks and Young aren't developing are on him and his staff. I think the Mack situation is mainly on Mack
966140159061262337 2018-02-20 02:38:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 This is one of the other reasons I was referencing. Some of it is also on Shaka and his own staff
966139168056324097 2018-02-20 02:35:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 They have been put into situations where they've had to because of the situations surrounding Andrew Jones and Tevin Mack. Now, this isn't the only reason, but it is a major factor why.

964957826111197184 2018-02-17 20:20:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BON_SBNation It OU sucks o'clock
964944468926455808 2018-02-17 19:27:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 And I can understand that, but don't ignore everything else
964943661048967168 2018-02-17 19:24:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 More than a couple....
964943148316352517 2018-02-17 19:22:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Did you see that top 16 seed list the committee released? Bunch o' bullshit.....
964942508730941440 2018-02-17 19:19:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Fans?
964942352199634945 2018-02-17 19:19:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn @jeffchaley Well, in his case it doesn't matter. He is gone. You don't turn down lottery pick money
964941320514035712 2018-02-17 19:15:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn @jeffchaley I think that is a bit of an overreach, but I'm talking about physically more than anything. His game needs more aggression on offense, but overall it's really good. He is going to get pushed around, though.
964940352682565634 2018-02-17 19:11:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jeffchaley @CoachSeahorn He isn't ready for the NBA, but he'll get drafted in the top 5 or top 10.
964938541758402560 2018-02-17 19:04:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> By FAR the biggest win of the season for @TexasMBB!! #Hookem #OUSucks
964937633456709634 2018-02-17 19:00:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChristineHookEm Gorgeous.....not that I am surprised by this. 
964937431748370434 2018-02-17 18:59:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith I can hook you up with some pretty badass brunch tomorrow.

964703713167396865 2018-02-16 03:31:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA I don't get why gun people can't see that this is an issue with multiple facets.....and yes, guns are one of them.
964703143002038272 2018-02-16 03:28:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 It was eye-opening to see on TV
964702878572187648 2018-02-16 03:27:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA This line of thinking from gun people is just beyond asinine.
964702043611987968 2018-02-16 03:24:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 He was supremely dominant & efficient tonight (89 pitches in 8 IP). Can't do it much better then that, especially for a season opener.

963950907112284160 2018-02-14 01:39:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TomTheHerman @mldubya73 By using this rationale, you are basically saying "Someone will always find a way to break the law, so we shouldn't bother having laws."

963938654447161344 2018-02-14 00:50:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TomTheHerman @mldubya73 Bombs are illegal (outside of military use)....so are many types of knives. None of those things kill as many people as guns.

963873024490594304 2018-02-14 20:30:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris So ironic coming from him.....
963868443891126272 2018-02-14 20:11:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall Do you already have your tickets to see it this week?

963866895089889281 2018-02-14 20:05:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NPR @realDonaldTrump Actually, no....we don't know that. Evidence would suggest that you're not.
963866154417651712 2018-02-14 20:02:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @axios @VP This is 100% false, and you know it. Therefore, you are willfully lying.
963852520505401344 2018-02-14 19:08:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Between that and Vader Booty, you are on a roll this week....
963851890864861184 2018-02-14 19:06:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith On a related note....."Brooks" and "Red"?? LMAO.....I died.

963549886439444482 2018-02-13 23:06:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @ATXANT10 As always, you continue to raise the bar for rest of us, kind sir.
963521067217248256 2018-02-13 21:11:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BetoORourke Ted Cruz isn't a real Texan. He has done nothing but use Texas for his own political gain.
963513943430975489 2018-02-13 20:43:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @RostronE They're 15-11.....that's better.

963300337863024640 2018-02-12 06:34:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS @randyharvey Yes it is. It's not like this is a new development with Texas fans and basketball.
963297809100365824 2018-02-12 06:24:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @RostronE No better? Really? You've been a season-ticket holder for 30 years, you say? Interesting....

963284099103363072 2018-02-12 05:30:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Texan_Hoosier @SBN_Wescott @Manzerd Shaka is not perfect. He has made mistakes, especially last year, but Tevin Mack becoming a locker room cancer and forcing Shaka to kick him off the team isn't on him. AJ getting hurt then getting leukemia isn't on him.
963283646554746880 2018-02-12 05:28:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Texan_Hoosier @SBN_Wescott @Manzerd But they are also missing their best perimeter player, and arguably the best overall player on the team. People are dismissing this.
963283201685905408 2018-02-12 05:26:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN You as well....once again, sorry. I know better, and I failed tonight.
963282662180950017 2018-02-12 05:24:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN Ok, I am going to end this by apologizing. I came at you out of frustration as much as anything else, and I am sorry. It was disrespectful and poor form on my part. Sorry Mike.
963282241878134784 2018-02-12 05:22:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Texan_Hoosier @SBN_Wescott @uttailgaters Your point here is valid. I need to take heed on this as well. I usually do. Tonight I failed.
963281973736243202 2018-02-12 05:21:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Texan_Hoosier @SBN_Wescott @Manzerd Example: Roach & Davis weren't Shaka recruits. They were Barnes recruits that Shaka had to make sure to keep because replacing them wasn't an option. However, look at how those two have improved from last year to this year.
963281472135278592 2018-02-12 05:19:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN Fake news, huh?
963281336902537216 2018-02-12 05:19:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Texan_Hoosier @SBN_Wescott @Manzerd The problem is, the reasons for the frustration and how they express it
963279431145086976 2018-02-12 05:11:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Texan_Hoosier @SBN_Wescott @Manzerd Yes
963279348693372928 2018-02-12 05:11:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN For someone who claims to not be shy about his opinions, you are unbelievably passive-aggressive.
963279131944390656 2018-02-12 05:10:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @Texan_Hoosier Football mindset and mentality....
963277891919405056 2018-02-12 05:05:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN Ok, then campaign to fire him....like you want. Keep chasing your tail and see how that works out.
963277420223717376 2018-02-12 05:03:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @Texan_Hoosier One of the biggest reasons for this is, on the whole, they don't know dick about basketball.
963275821480890368 2018-02-12 04:57:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS @RostronE Yeah that's it... Because Texas fans supported the program so well when Barnes was in his heyday.....
963275623337725952 2018-02-12 04:56:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ATXANT10 @MBHORNSFAN And you wouldn't be talking
963274985459585024 2018-02-12 04:53:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ATXANT10 @MBHORNSFAN It isn't about what you outright say, and you know that. It's about when you choose to speak up, and what you infer.
963274429001355266 2018-02-12 04:51:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ATXANT10 @MBHORNSFAN Then prove me wrong. Your timeline says I'm right.
963273512034226176 2018-02-12 04:47:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @ATXANT10 No he's not, Ant. He wants Texas to lose so that Shaka gets fired.
963273209234763776 2018-02-12 04:46:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS And Texas has shitty ones....
963270264275521541 2018-02-12 04:35:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @clarencehilljr Not when you have a wide open layup for the lead
963269910855081985 2018-02-12 04:33:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckCarltonDMN Because he was fouled
963269676934619137 2018-02-12 04:32:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer Unbelievable no-call at the end
963269179292946432 2018-02-12 04:30:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> Roach gets unquestionably fouled on the final play....no call
963268366927622144 2018-02-12 04:27:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Having the night of his life....
963267607934664705 2018-02-12 04:24:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith I can't help but laugh at this....even though I know my reaction should be different
963264571598401536 2018-02-12 04:12:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 Two circus shots and one no-look....unreal.
963258553984266241 2018-02-12 03:48:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Ah, of course....Higgins.
963256059249987584 2018-02-12 03:38:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Apparently the called Bamba for something there
963252432116551680 2018-02-12 03:24:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Shaka's offense struggles against zones (especially Baylor's) because no one really moves around within it to find holes and create openings. Am I wrong on this?
963237788123631616 2018-02-12 02:25:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF Have to actually show up first....which is my point.
963237329166102530 2018-02-12 02:24:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN The kind where Texas is getting some good shots but not hitting them.
963231439683772416 2018-02-12 02:00:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> I'll be blunt....Texas fans flat suck when it comes to supporting basketball.
963230446707453952 2018-02-12 01:56:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB That may be understating it....
963224881755250689 2018-02-12 01:34:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DebraMessing @KamalaHarris $15/hr is too high for a Federal minimum wage. Make the Federal $12/hr and let the cities/states that need higher do it on their own.

963212632294608897 2018-02-12 00:46:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @HawleyMO So, you're saying you approve of a massive waste of taxpayer money?

961441316050751489 2018-02-07 03:27:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports My only question is, is he sober?
961441226695299074 2018-02-07 03:27:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JimVertuno Is he sober?
961440758678081537 2018-02-07 03:25:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 They started off good offensively then lost it. Defensively they were good for that few minutes they switched to zone and that was it. The defensive end is much more worrisome. Two straight games.....

961434158391283712 2018-02-07 02:59:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Which was a terrible decision....
961431790908071941 2018-02-07 02:49:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Outside of a few minutes when Texas switched to zone, their defense has been terrible tonight.
961430506201141248 2018-02-07 02:44:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Too much settling for jumpers....not enough attacking the matchup zone.
961425804541480960 2018-02-07 02:25:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Don't you have to be hot first?
961424440163733505 2018-02-07 02:20:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Then he takes a quick 3 like he's on a hot streak......ugh.

961415929472176128 2018-02-07 01:46:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> Texas fans showing how excited they are about basketball coming off that win over OU with an Erwin Center crowd of??  Maybe 60% full, at best..... 
961413594381455360 2018-02-07 01:37:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Dylan has been the same way of late
961373504863178752 2018-02-07 22:57:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman AG Refer Madness doesn't know shit....and also isn't interested in actually learning. That man (along with many others in this administration) is a clear and present danger to this nation.
961346523975028738 2018-02-07 21:10:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @WWMcClyde It was an Auburn site that broke the news, and Texas took a couple of days to then release an official statement about his hiring. To me, that says they wanted to wait. IMO, it was so they could keep Carrington out on the road longer as the temporary 10th coach.
961342234250612736 2018-02-07 20:53:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson @chrisgb00 This.....
961341597341319169 2018-02-07 20:51:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @WWMcClyde Seemed like they got pushed into announcing that when they did, IMO.
961340907437068289 2018-02-07 20:48:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @WWMcClyde Right, if a change does occur, it wasn't going to happen until after today.
961339510968803328 2018-02-07 20:42:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @WWMcClyde I'm still waiting for another shoe to drop when it comes to the coaching staff. I think that is when we can start to determine who will call plays.

960728706745556992 2018-02-05 04:15:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Tonight just epitomized how brutal this conference is and how razor thin the margin really is between the top 6 teams.
960728143601504256 2018-02-05 04:13:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 No, they are not efficient offensively.
960728038026698752 2018-02-05 04:13:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Ok, if OU had pulled this out, O was going to mention how WVU & Texas would be the 2 teams really kicking themselves when it came to Big 12 standings.
960727449951723520 2018-02-05 04:10:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 No, Big 12 game....was it Tech in Lubbock?

959527355759972353 2018-02-02 20:42:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NBCNews @rodofdisaster I feel pretty confident that he will probably end up in solitary for quite a while
959526198962458624 2018-02-02 20:37:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 The problem is you can't really take with those other coaches say at face value either

959524243234086912 2018-02-02 20:29:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NBCNews @rodofdisaster There are a lot of adults who need to feel guilt, but the parents probably aren't included in that, even though I'm sure they do.
959523992032948225 2018-02-02 20:28:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NBCNews @rodofdisaster Like most parents of kids who are sexually assaulted or molested by a other adult, he probably wasn't aware it happened, because he daughters probably completely internalized it, like most victims do.

958929113603026946 2018-01-31 05:04:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 @ReedRobertson Your previous tweet almost killed me with laughter.
958928968836681728 2018-01-31 05:04:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> While this game tonight was horribly officiated (I mean it was ATROCIOUS), and Texas got the worse end of it....if Texas' FT shooting, which had been good in Big 12 play, didn't fail them they probably win it in regulation.
958927207723945984 2018-01-31 04:57:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 @ReedRobertson Lol.....goodnight.

958922280146530304 2018-01-31 04:37:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @craigfloyd Strange part is, they have been shooting FTs pretty well in Big 12 play.
958922007948775424 2018-01-31 04:36:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @craigfloyd This is also true
958921518511247360 2018-01-31 04:34:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal He was getting bailed out all night by the refs. He had half his points at the line and 3 Texas players fouled out.
958921308540211200 2018-01-31 04:33:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @YahooForde This game was unbelievably poorly officiated and that non-call on the last shot epitomized it.
958920872286457857 2018-01-31 04:32:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 Ref show.....and Texas was victimized more than Tech was. Still, Texas should have won it in regulation.
958920686105489408 2018-01-31 04:31:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal And pushing off....
958920496300539904 2018-01-31 04:30:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS After an obvious push-off
958918901009657858 2018-01-31 04:24:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer But Texas had a 4-point lead with under 3 to go with a chance to extend it and blew it all. Partially due to poor officials, but all those missed FTs....
958918202842599425 2018-01-31 04:21:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer Texas should have won this game already
958917846909751296 2018-01-31 04:20:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer Not really....
958913190347329536 2018-01-31 04:01:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman If you want to see some horrible officiating, this Texas-Texas Tech game has been an embarrassment.
958912865414631425 2018-01-31 04:00:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 @Bitterwhiteguy @DMcComasOB @MarkRosner3 @CedGolden It's hard to quantify just how poor the officiating has been in the game, both ways. It's been an embarrassment.
958912517299949569 2018-01-31 03:58:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Kid has only had 13 attempts all season, but you're right
958897380828569601 2018-01-31 02:58:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Texas has missed at least 6 shots from within 5 feet
958896642186514432 2018-01-31 02:55:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @Bitterwhiteguy He stuck his foot out for a kick-save, then picked up the ball
958896309108445184 2018-01-31 02:54:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 After 15 minutes of allowing hockey on the court.....
958895876470198274 2018-01-31 02:52:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters They have been horrendous both ways.
958891623148146688 2018-01-31 02:35:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 This officiating crew is STRUG-GUH-LING.....
958891451278069760 2018-01-31 02:35:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @MarkRosner3 I think the called a BS touch foul on Davis on the drive.
958891133077278720 2018-01-31 02:33:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRosner3 @Bitterwhiteguy But if it was a push off, then it should have been Texas ball.
958890825152434176 2018-01-31 02:32:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @MarkRosner3 Then why did they keep the ball?

957839563669590017 2018-01-28 04:55:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedcruz @chelseahandler @johnny_jessup US representatives and senators are elected by people who live in their state/district, but they don't just represent those people. They represent all of us, and the decisions they make affect all of us.
957837177861402624 2018-01-28 04:45:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedcruz @chelseahandler @johnny_jessup Ok, I will tell you. Regardless of what state you live in, someone from another state is still an American citizen. Someone from another country isn't. That's how it's different.
957835320011247616 2018-01-28 04:38:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedcruz @chelseahandler @johnny_jessup No, it's not. Take a minute and think about it and you will understand why it's not.
957835097893490689 2018-01-28 04:37:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @nikkihaley It's called a comedic bit. If you didn't find it funny, fine....but it was a joke.
957834695366053888 2018-01-28 04:36:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedcruz @chelseahandler @johnny_jessup Lol, no....it really isn't.
957833464463667200 2018-01-28 04:31:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedcruz @chelseahandler @johnny_jessup Ok then, what do you think my answer to that is?

957812074205335552 2018-01-28 03:06:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedcruz @chelseahandler @johnny_jessup Is that a serious question?
957789042581655552 2018-01-28 01:34:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedcruz @chelseahandler @johnny_jessup Also, we are long past the days where the only people that get involved in the election of a representative or sentator are the people in the district/state, and we aren't going back to that.
957788064893476864 2018-01-28 01:30:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedcruz @chelseahandler @johnny_jessup They pass laws that affect all states, so.....
957785294090199040 2018-01-28 01:19:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedcruz @chelseahandler @johnny_jessup I would say who holds the office of US Senator is every citizen's business

957449777771417600 2018-01-27 03:06:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckCarltonDMN One day, one game for each team. The strength of a conference is measured on the overall performance over the course of a season, but then....you know this.

957026351445356545 2018-01-26 23:03:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde That part is definitely true, and Ruth was the first superstar athlete. He, in many ways, set the stage of superstardom for Ali and others.

956974397641908224 2018-01-26 19:37:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott My response as the mayor would be "suddenly adding policing of your campus & extended campus would require a massive cost increase that we don't have the budget for, so we can either come to an agreement to cover this cost, or we can significantly raise your taxes"
956972262766366720 2018-01-26 19:29:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott (2/2) And if the university does require usage of the city PD for something (emergencies, large events, etc), they pay for it when needed or as part of a contract.
956971790840029184 2018-01-26 19:27:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Basically, yes. I believe that any university with its own PD has an agreement with their municipality that they will handle their own policing for designated areas. My guess is they receive some form of tax break as a part of the agreement. (1/2)
956968585028689920 2018-01-26 19:14:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Because if the a university (especially the size of Texas) ditched its police force and asked the city to now take over those responsibilities, the city will ask "Who is going to pay for this?".
956968035717443584 2018-01-26 19:12:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Less (or zero) control of oversight in all areas, less dedicated policing of your university, much more red tape to deal with because of the city, but....less possibility of undue influence.
956966952664223749 2018-01-26 19:07:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott With choice #1 you have more direct control of oversight in all areas as well as a police force dedicated to law enforcement for your university, but increased possibility of undue influence over their actions.  Choice #2 is the reverse of that.
956965719996096512 2018-01-26 19:03:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Let's take UT, for example....  Massive school, student population of a small city. You have two choices:   1) Have your own police dept for your campus & extended campus areas.   2) Shell out A LOT of money to the city you reside in to subsidize them policing those areas.
956963699629182977 2018-01-26 18:55:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott There are many good reasons to have them, but they have to be allowed to operate as any other police dept would.
956962073992417280 2018-01-26 18:48:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @chrisgb00 Won't happen....
956961877346734080 2018-01-26 18:47:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Done....call/text if you need anything.
956956021725024257 2018-01-26 18:24:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheDozens1 @rodofdisaster Back to the point....I couldn't care less if Austin gets an MLS team, but if people really want it, this is how I would sell it. Some public money, with major public benefits attached to the project, & some private. Great location for the team without adding another facility.
956953722256592899 2018-01-26 18:15:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheDozens1 @rodofdisaster Sounds like....
956952680064323586 2018-01-26 18:11:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheDozens1 @rodofdisaster That is they referred to in "Die Hard 2" as an "unforeseen human factor"

956951104515960832 2018-01-26 18:04:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheDozens1 @rodofdisaster In this scenario as a voter, I would support PARTIAL public funding for this due to the benefits to AISD. I should mention that I would want the proposal to include a refurbishing of both the basketball gym and baseball field that are on site.

956758877189517312 2018-01-25 05:21:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 I know Jeff better than Ben, but you are correct.
956753792657080321 2018-01-25 05:00:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I'm just saying, if the MLS and whoever want to sell the council on spending public money, then they need to give them something to sell to voters. To me, the major benefit to AISD would be that sell. Honestly, though, I don't care if it happens or not.
956749925974401024 2018-01-25 04:45:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde It would, yes, but doing it in this fashion would be a much easier sell than the alternative, IMO.
956730217355272193 2018-01-25 03:27:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS @ATXANT10 A cooperative effort between MLS & Austin to tear down & rebuild Burger could work if both sides are willing. Win-win, IMO.... A 25k-30k seat stadium for MLS in a prime location and a much-needed 1st-class facility for AISD. Too small for XFL, though....
956728512542597121 2018-01-25 03:20:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS @josephcook89 No chance....

956728274004127745 2018-01-25 03:19:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 The NFL won't be in Austin. San Antonio? I think they would be crazy for not looking into it, but not Austin. @BDavisAAS
956727591360135168 2018-01-25 03:16:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I agree with you when it comes to the MLS & Austin. The only way, IMO, it would be a win-win is if MLS & the city teamed up to revamp AISD's Burger Stadium as its location. Tear down Burger, build a 30k-seat stadium. It gives MLS a great location & gives AISD a 1st class facility

956000880670773248 2018-01-23 03:09:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @ReedRobertson Young has improved, especially defensively, but on offense he still just plays too fast.
955999571418714112 2018-01-23 03:03:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @ReedRobertson Well, Jones was much improved before everything happened. Roach & Davis have gotten better in Big 12 play, and Febres is a freshman. He will get better. Coleman has to improve and Young has just been a mystery.
955999107637809152 2018-01-23 03:02:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ReedRobertson @thelonghorns12 True....Texas hasn't had a solid 3-pt shooting team for a few years.
955998930382225409 2018-01-23 03:01:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @ReedRobertson I have given it to the Gods at this point

955997803079196672 2018-01-23 02:56:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> Someone needs to call Joel Ferguson's wife. She needs to come get her man. Oh, and some people over @michiganstateu apparently were living in caves during the whole Penn St scandal. Just, wow....https://twitter.com/freep/status/955872815802134532
955995288795312128 2018-01-23 02:46:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ReedRobertson @thelonghorns12 Interestingly, their 3-pt shooting has improved noticeably in Big 12 play, but not having Jones is just such a hindrance.
955994658882146304 2018-01-23 02:44:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @ReedRobertson Some of those things are within Shaka's control and some aren't.
955994446012837893 2018-01-23 02:43:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @ReedRobertson Well, if Bamba can get stronger in his lower body, have better hand strength when he has the ball, have his guards (other than Coleman) get better at entry passes, and have Osetkowski play more on the interior.....then yeah.

955628605287133185 2018-01-22 02:29:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @MBHORNSFAN Your tweet intimated as such
955628378467590144 2018-01-22 02:28:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @thelonghorns12 And they're improved despite not having their best overall offensive player for half the season.
955627927990947840 2018-01-22 02:27:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @MBHORNSFAN You are proving my point about Texas fans when it comes to basketball.
955627704489009152 2018-01-22 02:26:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @MBHORNSFAN Wow, this is moronic. You think Texas isn't better?
955627473349365760 2018-01-22 02:25:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @thelonghorns12 Did you see the statistic @Bitterwhiteguy brought up about Huggins today?
955626603165384710 2018-01-22 02:21:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @MBHORNSFAN No, it means you should have a modicum of perspective. I would hope that you're smarter than this comment you just made.
955625046034264064 2018-01-22 02:15:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @MBHORNSFAN The Big 12 during Barnes tenure was never as difficult, top to bottom, as this league is right now.
955624010594832384 2018-01-22 02:11:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Could Texas become a blue blood in college basketball? Yes....  Are we? No.... Because we don't really give a shit about it, and our fans start calling for the coach's head if he doesn't win 20 games in his first 25.
955622881387581440 2018-01-22 02:07:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 It really isn't so much of a premise anymore as it is a provable fact.
955622725195894784 2018-01-22 02:06:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 This gets back to my premise that Texas fans don't know shit from Shinola about college basketball
955622587639451648 2018-01-22 02:05:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports He killed the Texas offense down the stretch too with misses near the rim.
955622284865220608 2018-01-22 02:04:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Exactly. My point was Beard has less skins on the wall than Shaka.
955621759411195910 2018-01-22 02:02:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 That isn't to say he's not a good coach, but still....
955621409459458048 2018-01-22 02:01:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 The Dixon love, I get. He has skins on the wall. Beard is the flavor of the month.
955620786697629697 2018-01-22 01:58:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports Get your facts straight
955620418274160640 2018-01-22 01:57:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Their offensive funks just make it harder than it should be. Should have blown this team out tonight....
955618973885886464 2018-01-22 01:51:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @_delconte @PaulOverhoff Oh I forgot....it does improve the sales for the official UT retailers who sell those bags. There is that.
955617805881303040 2018-01-22 01:46:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @_delconte @PaulOverhoff You're missing the point. The only thing it improves is time, which I could care less about.
955614877313327106 2018-01-22 01:35:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @_delconte @PaulOverhoff Lol, ok man....I think perfectly well, thanks. All a clear bag does is save time searching it.  A good & thorough search of an unclear bag prevents a weapon being snuck in as well. What is the difference? The time it takes. You want to try thinking again?
955611212984840194 2018-01-22 01:20:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB I know he won't, but if he stayed another year with some added lower body strength? Good Lord....
955610811166228480 2018-01-22 01:19:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRosner3 Come for the burritos, stay for the interest rates?
955609983118401536 2018-01-22 01:15:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @_delconte The clear bag policy doesn't improve security. It just (supposedly) speeds up the line for getting through security.
955603423801610240 2018-01-22 00:49:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS Should be up by 15

955600639630958592 2018-01-22 00:38:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 True, but it's about a hated division rival

955598782112108544 2018-01-22 00:31:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Yes....they should be up by 14 at least.
955598511944413184 2018-01-22 00:30:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 @WWMcClyde I didn't disagree with you, hehe.
955598125967855627 2018-01-22 00:28:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 @WWMcClyde It's just fodder
955597287748702208 2018-01-22 00:25:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Both
955597001458094080 2018-01-22 00:24:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 I am team "Meteor strike" for this game, but if you put a gun to my head, I would take the Pats.
955594937965441026 2018-01-22 00:16:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer If you're at the game, I'm in section 44.
955590119297298433 2018-01-22 23:56:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @nhnpc @WWMcClyde One can hope....
955589803105570817 2018-01-22 23:55:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> Unfortunately a lot of others have apparently chosen to make the decision I made last week.
955589459428478976 2018-01-22 23:54:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> I was a bad fan last week for the Tech game. Not tonight.... #HookEm @TexasMBBpic.twitter.com/p0uSkVjpZv

955585946589847553 2018-01-22 23:40:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I guess what I mean by that is, her problem is not lack of knowledge about the issue, it's what she does with the knowledge.
955585173394993152 2018-01-22 23:37:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Joy Reid is like Maddow to a lesser degree, but at least Maddow is supremely informed. However, they both annoy me.
955584242569875456 2018-01-22 23:33:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Chron_MattYoung I am team @smod4real in two weeks

955528293662457861 2018-01-22 19:51:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheRock Can we expect to see you make an in-person appearance tonight at #RAW25?
955513705097293824 2018-01-22 18:53:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Actually, this is more on Trump than it is either party in Congress.
955322101849870336 2018-01-21 06:11:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival I have already pledged my support for @smod4real for that game.
955321322996928517 2018-01-21 06:08:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm If there is anything I can do to help, or send someone to you to help with, let me know.
955265202513203208 2018-01-21 02:25:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers OL coach got scapegoated for the Clayborn debacle.....
955257593232011266 2018-01-21 01:55:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> Welp....looks like it's team @smod4real for me in 2 weeks.
955255448881586176 2018-01-21 01:47:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaketapper Looks like I'll be rooting for @smod4real in 2 weeks....
955254824253173760 2018-01-21 01:44:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Try decades of history starting with James Naismith.
955231655740002304 2018-01-21 00:12:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm Close, but I agree....
955230296739282944 2018-01-21 00:07:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 He got hit
955230235372523522 2018-01-21 00:06:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch He got hit
955229144991879169 2018-01-21 00:02:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @frankpallotta As a Cowboys fan, that's how I feel about an Eagles-patriots SB.
955225613257920513 2018-01-21 23:48:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball You forgot to include an option for @smod4real
955225154824671233 2018-01-21 23:46:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> If the Eagles win tonight, I'll be rooting for @smod4real in 2 weeks.

955214388499238912 2018-01-21 23:03:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I wish I could agree....
955214041244471296 2018-01-21 23:02:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndyDessner @TommySledge @darrenrbyrne No, it's called assault with a weapon.
955212095187976198 2018-01-21 22:54:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Amendola has made some GREAT catches in the 4Q
955211502717427713 2018-01-21 22:52:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN Lol....ok
955210426899488770 2018-01-21 22:48:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs As a defense, 25 is better than 45.
955210107108904960 2018-01-21 22:46:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs The reason I like 25 is, it's still punitive on a deep ball.
955209756179824642 2018-01-21 22:45:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndrewSiciliano 3rd & 18 was pretty huge....
955209485999661056 2018-01-21 22:44:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs I think 25 yards would work.
955209395624955905 2018-01-21 22:44:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs There does need to be a yardage limit.

955206294939553800 2018-01-21 22:31:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> 3rd & 18, Jags.....  You. Can't. Let. That. Happen.
955200763348779008 2018-01-21 22:09:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jaguars @justinwells2424 The are SALTY!!
955198976793415681 2018-01-21 22:02:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Time for a delayed draw
955196615387762688 2018-01-21 21:53:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm Agreed. It's the rule. The penalty was correct.
955195912342704128 2018-01-21 21:50:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 @rodofdisaster He did, but he went high. Church didn't even think about going low.
955194859433943040 2018-01-21 21:46:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 @rodofdisaster Mid-section or legs....
955194735265746945 2018-01-21 21:45:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 @rodofdisaster Legal
955194597818490881 2018-01-21 21:45:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 @rodofdisaster They want him to go lower. Period.
955194513353510913 2018-01-21 21:44:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 We can disagree about the rule, but the flag was 100% correct.
955192980142460929 2018-01-21 21:38:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NBCNewsBETTER @NBCNews @cartwrighteous Lol
955191824733409280 2018-01-21 21:34:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @arby10 @MikeGriff33 I agree, but them's the rules. Now, if it knocks Gronk out of the game, the Jags will take that trade.
955191553231867904 2018-01-21 21:33:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer @FueL_Rock It became uncatchable once Bouye rode Cooks out of bounds while the the ball was in mid-flight. Come on now....
955190754707681280 2018-01-21 21:29:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SandlerJ Same
955190402453245953 2018-01-21 21:28:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SandlerJ Would you? Lol
955190241459146752 2018-01-21 21:27:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Definitely
955190178548781064 2018-01-21 21:27:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN I hate the Pats too, but that was clear PI. He rode him out of bounds as the ball was in the air and never looked to play the ball.
955189934259888129 2018-01-21 21:26:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MikeGriff33 @arby10 Yes...go for the mid-section or the legs.
955189764696821760 2018-01-21 21:26:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BillSimmons Stop Bill....just stop.
955189635268993025 2018-01-21 21:25:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer It wasn't borderline
955189485825941504 2018-01-21 21:24:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN Yes it was. Bouye never played the ball.
955189394268450816 2018-01-21 21:24:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway The delay flag was also correct. Bouye never played the ball on the PI. Right call....
955189172616286221 2018-01-21 21:23:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn How can you tell if Gronk is conussed? #Neanderthal
955188990864510977 2018-01-21 21:22:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN Both of those flags were correct
955188899864858624 2018-01-21 21:22:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OfficialShon_4 Nah man....both correct calls.
955188827240452102 2018-01-21 21:22:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Both of those penalties were legit
955160248012230656 2018-01-21 19:28:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 They view basketball from a football perspective, which is completely wrong.
955159371775987713 2018-01-21 19:25:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 But hey....Shaka is a bad coach because they got blown out at WVU yesterday.
955131101655289858 2018-01-21 17:32:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers They are doing it because of what happened after the Phillies won the WS a few years back.

955128728954331138 2018-01-21 17:23:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chucktodd I'm guessing it would generate a lot of curiosity-level interest, because it would be a team playing at home for the 1st time ever, plus a team in its 1st Super Bowl ever.

953831193681825797 2018-01-17 03:27:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ColemanESPN OSU did something similar this past Saturday when Texas was in Stillwater.
953830105234771968 2018-01-17 03:23:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 They lost to Baylor & OSU because he played hurt (and horribly) at Baylor and was out against OSU. Texas should be 5-1 right now.
953829006624862209 2018-01-17 03:18:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Yeah, but that record will lose me $50
953828505833361408 2018-01-17 03:16:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 It just shows how dumb they are. The ONLY reason Dixon is at TCU is because it's his alma mater.

953794234708103169 2018-01-17 01:00:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar What do you think a coach is? A big resource.  He also has input into where other resources are directed.   I have made my point as clear as possible. You disagree.....fine.   Have a good night.
953793378369572864 2018-01-17 00:57:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar Exactly
953793206088617984 2018-01-17 00:56:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar As I said, you bring in a quality OC to pair with Patricia.
953792974621741057 2018-01-17 00:55:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar If you hire a new coach whose expertise is on the offense, which side of the ball are you more likely to focus your resources?
953792450312753153 2018-01-17 00:53:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aldotcom pic.twitter.com/5YykwIM8N2
953790527090151424 2018-01-17 00:45:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar And I say that based on the history of their franchise. If the Colts aren't going to focus more of their resources & draft picks towards defense, then hire a head coach who focuses on it. Perhaps he can make chicken salad out of chicken shit the way Dungy did.
953789544360488966 2018-01-17 00:42:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar How about Patricia? Why have the Colts not pursued him?
953788533130563584 2018-01-17 00:38:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar How many more ways would you like me to say it?
953782257449390080 2018-01-17 00:13:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar Correct, and hiring a defensive-minded coach is what the Colts need
953742881633767424 2018-01-17 21:36:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar This starts in the front office. Dungy was able put together a competent defense even though the team put the vast majority of its salary cap towards the offense. If they actually put some focus on the defense, it will make them better.
953741849935732736 2018-01-17 21:32:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar The Colts have never put an emphasis on defense, even when Dungy was there. It is the primary reason, IMO, that they haven't had more success.
953741439887925248 2018-01-17 21:30:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar I just stated why.
953738868028858370 2018-01-17 21:20:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar No, I'm saying I don't believe it is a good fit for either side. I believe the Colts need a defensive-minded head coach with a quality OC.
953729695765364738 2018-01-17 20:44:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar Uncertain quarterback situation, plus the team as a whole just isn't very good. It just doesn't seem like a good situation for him to jump into
953726214044372995 2018-01-17 20:30:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreggDoyelStar McDaniel's just doesn't seem like a good fit there

953315538578624513 2018-01-16 17:18:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Javelina034 Some bridges are frozen, but I drove from north Austin to Westlake. Mopac & 360 both were fine.
953314636249608192 2018-01-16 17:14:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Javelina034 Roads are pretty clear. I drove to work with zero issues.
953090703298621448 2018-01-15 02:25:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 @srr50 A couple of my favorite Eddie Reese moments were when he would be a guest on the weekly Longhorn coaches show on the Longhorn Network with Rick Barnes. He and Rick we're good friends, and Eddie was awesome.
953089977692418051 2018-01-15 02:22:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 @UtilityInfieldr Oh come on.... They had a double-digit lead for a few seconds in the first quarter

953080700881731584 2018-01-15 01:45:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> I'm gonna laugh when all these Austin-area school districts and businesses close tomorrow and the roads are clear and dry.

952697479002279936 2018-01-14 00:22:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Parcells was in his 2nd or 3rd year when Zimmer left. Payton is the big regret.

952679319960203264 2018-01-14 23:10:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm Lost Zimmer, then lost Payton because of Parcells.

952667157644558336 2018-01-14 22:22:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist Jerry has never prioritized defense since Jimmy left.
952666861983842306 2018-01-14 22:20:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NFLonFOX @NFL I want to watch on my tablet. I had the Sunday Ticket this year. HELP!!
952666431262375937 2018-01-14 22:19:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jimmygards None of Tony's teams ever had a defense as good as J-ville's
952659610376265728 2018-01-14 21:52:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Not with the injury losses on defense, IMO....
952658952306806785 2018-01-14 21:49:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump Please explain how the "lottery" system & chain migration work, if you can. I don't believe you know your ass from a hole in the ground on this issue (among many others).  We'll wait.....
952658057326219265 2018-01-14 21:45:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 Oh well....
952656571187826689 2018-01-14 21:40:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisyates11 Yes, they should have won the game. I disagree with your characterization of "easy".
952643226414075905 2018-01-14 20:46:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Both 4th down playcalls on 4th & 1 have been terrible.
952642929465503744 2018-01-14 20:45:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 They rightly trashed him, and it's not like he is playing well today. Defense and run game is why they're ahead....
952642377294012416 2018-01-14 20:43:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Fantastic....
952626299419480064 2018-01-14 19:39:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisyates11 I disagree. It's never easy in this conference, ESPECIALLY when you are missing your best offensive and best defensive guards.
952625016683757574 2018-01-14 19:34:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade Is the thought that the surgery is what has caused this? Because that is hideous....
952618822900572161 2018-01-14 19:10:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA Because it was Brown....
952601028200976384 2018-01-14 17:59:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @johnny_jessup That is a terrible attitude to have when it comes to college basketball
952573972113166336 2018-01-14 16:11:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisyates11 I agree, but your statements basically dismiss that very big factor.
952572012014292993 2018-01-14 16:04:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mschlapp This is 100% not true, and you know it. You are knowingly telling outright lies
952570844919881728 2018-01-14 15:59:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasMBB @BradKellner Missing two starting guards eventually catches up to you

952360756141527040 2018-01-13 02:04:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisyates11 They. Are. Missing. Two. Starting. Guards.
952250586900127744 2018-01-13 18:46:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde "I think what's important right now is someone needs to find a place for Randy Kinder to lay down."

952187353019437059 2018-01-13 14:35:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HelmetBoy_Texas Can't stand her. She is such a dragging weight on the party, it's crazy. The best thing the party could do is replace her in leadership, but they won't.

951900120337059841 2018-01-12 19:34:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny Watching the child-like enjoyment of the media being allowed to say that publicly has been funny.

951569680405352448 2018-01-11 21:41:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets @Shippyfunsports Uncle-ing is awesome and very underrated.
951569371364765696 2018-01-11 21:39:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PBatBON That seems like a lot, but 2 games would definitely seem reasonable.
951569006082838528 2018-01-11 21:38:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 @craigfloyd I've been told that as well. That place apparently funnels noise down to the court due to how the expansion was designed.

951564921145245696 2018-01-11 21:22:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HelmetBoy_Texas The weird stick trees in this landscaping model certainly don't help.
951555683266236421 2018-01-11 20:45:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @BenRogers I know the 1st one as well....great, funny dude.

951538792393052161 2018-01-11 19:38:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF @thelonghorns12 Possibly, but he did have 3 steals last night, and would have had another that might have clinched the game in regulation if not for a BS foul call.
951538152623296523 2018-01-11 19:35:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 From what you have told me about what you two were out doing, I did have LOVED seeing that on the show. Such interesting stuff....
951537660698529792 2018-01-11 19:33:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF He slipped as he made a swipe for the ball.

951326320440545280 2018-01-10 05:34:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I don't disagree, but my point is....Indy called him. You take the call, period.
951325996946509824 2018-01-10 05:32:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Texas played 7 guys tonight in a 2OT game. I think it's safe to say they were all gassed.

951322459969671169 2018-01-10 05:18:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @MBHORNSFAN Dixon is a VERY good coach who took over a talented program that was talented but underperforming. TCU has no basketball history or pedigree and he is an alum.....of course they will give him time.
951320984593813504 2018-01-10 05:12:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Roach will miss a couple of weeks at least....
951320409160462336 2018-01-10 05:10:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @chuckwmatthews Bamba's 5th was a good call. The foul on the Coleman steal was straight garbage.
951318110040219649 2018-01-10 05:01:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @Jeff_Caplan Not with 5.7 seconds left, IMO....
951317627993034754 2018-01-10 04:59:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @Jeff_Caplan After he made the first you back off so as not to foul.

951283250026242048 2018-01-10 02:42:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Are Banks and Hamm such liabilities on one end of the court or the other that they can't even provide a few minutes right now?
951281399050448901 2018-01-10 02:35:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Because he isn't a legitimate member of the media....he's a mouthpiece. @billyliucci

950756364418211840 2018-01-09 15:49:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 A grad transfer is the only possibility for Texas, IMO.....again, if Shane were to leave.
950755743543779328 2018-01-09 15:46:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I think there is zero chance that happens.....unless Shane leaves.

950573275188514817 2018-01-08 03:41:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JenksNBCS Georgia had him dead to rights on that 3rd down, but.....bad tackling, and he rode the momentum.

950461583800619009 2018-01-08 20:17:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WeAreAFCA Mr. Berry, I'm saddened that you viewed him speaking as an "opportunity", considering he has shown no real remorse or contrition for what he did. You should probably re-think some things, sir.
950455039721697285 2018-01-08 19:51:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall Nope
950453122572472322 2018-01-08 19:44:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @brendatracy24 @jessicawluther @AndeWall Brenda did last year, I believe, but your point remains completely valid.

950171872183930880 2018-01-07 01:06:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris This being said, they never should have traded Benjamin. They have nothing at WR that scares anyone.
950170790988861440 2018-01-07 01:02:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris And he has always been inaccurate
950170226733305857 2018-01-07 01:00:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Oh, 10-15 yards further in, I may have agreed with you....
950170085720764417 2018-01-07 00:59:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris No one has ever questioned his arm strength. It's his decision-making and lack of accuracy that have always hurt him
950169114970148864 2018-01-07 00:55:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Exactly....time, score, field position. Punt the ball. Luckily it didn't backfire on Payton.

949832270403244032 2018-01-06 02:37:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 The lack of intelligence is far worse when it comes to basketball as compared to the other sports. I contend Texas has the most basketball-stupid fanbase of any P5 school. It's pretty astounding.
949831274218377216 2018-01-06 02:33:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Basketball might be the worst, though, because Texas fans are generally so stupid when it comes to college basketball.

947320494809866240 2017-12-30 04:16:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @thelonghorns12 Also, you are correcr about the Big 12. It is the best conference, top to bottom, in college basketball....and it isn't close.
947319999303180288 2017-12-30 04:14:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @thelonghorns12 TCU, has been a bit overcooked, IMO, because of Jamie Dixon. They are good, for sure, but a little over-ranked.
947318729502875649 2017-12-30 04:09:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @thelonghorns12 Shaka has at least 2 more years after this one.
947315831771488256 2017-12-30 03:57:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @andreatrisdale I have yet to see you not cute
947312314709151744 2017-12-30 03:43:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @WWMcClyde Oh hell.....Austin better batten down the hatches.pic.twitter.com/VREKPFys2m
947302600130433027 2017-12-30 03:05:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jeffchaley True, but I go to Indy every Christmas. I should have made more of an attempt to make a game before now.
947302137414987782 2017-12-30 03:03:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @Bitterwhiteguy @jeffchaley That is the rumor. I have never been either.
947301449465303047 2017-12-30 03:00:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @Bitterwhiteguy @jeffchaley I was in Indy this week. I would have tried to go today if I hadn't been flying out tonight.
947300876384907269 2017-12-30 02:58:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @TracyRingolsby @ExamineBaseball @WWMcClyde I have never been able to stand that Dave Cody lookalike. I groan every time I see him on the floor for a Texas game.
947300348804419584 2017-12-30 02:56:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @Bitterwhiteguy @jeffchaley You are correct, of course  (ex: last night), however, Butler has a recent track record with 'Nova.
947298736413212673 2017-12-30 02:49:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jeffchaley Something that should lift Texas fans spirits after last night....look at what Alabama did to the Aggies today, as well as Butler to Villanova. @Bitterwhiteguy @DMcComasOB
947276067928264704 2017-12-30 01:19:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HiMyNameIsSeton I ask this question often.....
947275212214669313 2017-12-30 01:16:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @Alyssa_Milano I have some nice wool socks I would be happy to give you. 
947274431222763521 2017-12-30 01:13:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @POTUS @VP Yet you condemn those who are peacefully protesting in this country who are speaking out for equality. Interesting....
947271038630494208 2017-12-30 00:59:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen It might convince Joe Thomas tp stay as well....
947269433587896321 2017-12-30 00:53:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde And excommunicated....
947257355552677889 2017-12-30 00:05:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson So....I'm star-gazing because I believe that people's rights should be protected? Ok then....
947241891661312000 2017-12-30 23:04:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson Your position is also one giant "if".
947241584126459904 2017-12-30 23:02:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson There you go again....speaking in absolutes where none exist.
947238255849803782 2017-12-30 22:49:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson In this scenario, if it were determined by a judge/court that the player's contract was illegally terminated, that is the labor law that would have been broken, as a violation of the CBA.
947235471893106689 2017-12-30 22:38:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast Do Houston fans realize the problems with the Texans are much more due to Rick Smith than BOB?
947234628850593793 2017-12-30 22:35:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Did Trae Young fly to Indy after the TCU game?
947232788931121154 2017-12-30 22:27:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson Also, a law may be broken by firing a player for that....and it would be labor law. If it were determined that it is a violation of the CBA....
947232226000941058 2017-12-30 22:25:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson And my point was, comparing your job to theirs is a wholly inaccurate comparison (which it is), and that saying it is a "fact" that they "can & should" be fired for kneeling during the anthem is incorrect (which it is).
947226808721772544 2017-12-30 22:04:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson I never said it wasn't a possibility. I said it wasn't a fact. Also, there wouldn't be an appeal here. This scenario would go straight to court, in an arbitration capacity at minimum, because it would involve the possible unlawful termination of a player's contract.
947223771315933184 2017-12-30 21:52:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson Legal experts disagree with each other on the topic. Read the whole article. The bottom line is, none of them know for sure. If an owner ever released a player for doing that, they would never make it known that that was the reason, because the union would take them to court.
947220807830462466 2017-12-30 21:40:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Studdard64 @chrisgb00 Guys, that is a fake Sam account
947220483040309256 2017-12-30 21:38:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I can't wait to see Roach on him.
947219784395042816 2017-12-30 21:36:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson A requirement to stand during the Nat'l Anthem also isn't part of it. My logic is based on law & the terms of the NFL CBA. Yours is based on your opinion. If a team/player sat out a game as a form of protest, then they would be violating their contract. See the difference?
947216685077016576 2017-12-30 21:23:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson So, in this case, the type of job is quite consequential.....and yes, playing a sport professionally is very much a 'job'.
947216108771213313 2017-12-30 21:21:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson Once more, you're incorrect. It is not remotely "fact" that they either can or should be fired for that. "Should" is solely an opinion, not a fact. "Can" is also not factual, because NFL players are part of a union whose rights are collectively bargained. Want to try again?
947208878529400838 2017-12-30 20:52:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SInow No they won't
947197471448584194 2017-12-30 20:07:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot Thanks brother! It was great meeting you, and good recommendation on @CityBarbeque. Good stuff!
947196893582581761 2017-12-30 20:05:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson I do get it. Stop comparing your job to theirs, because they aren't remotely the same.
947192717892866049 2017-12-30 19:48:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregghenson Your job isn't their job. This is not a difficult concept.
946927744889257984 2017-12-29 02:15:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sehlinger3 @sehIinger3 @miguelevision OOHHHHHHH!!!!

946927027180986369 2017-12-29 02:12:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sehlinger3 @sehIinger3 @miguelevision How can they have the same handle?
946916070820020229 2017-12-29 01:29:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 USC had a better resume than Ohio St.
946915287831588865 2017-12-29 01:26:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 It was cold.....no one wanted OT
946910783920893954 2017-12-29 01:08:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I worry abour all our QBs health if the OL doesn't get better.
946900884964937736 2017-12-29 00:28:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 No way in hell that happens unless Shane leaves.
946899469672566784 2017-12-29 00:23:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BON_SBNation They always travel well to this game.
946844213408403457 2017-12-29 20:43:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN New coach, new opportunity
946837146870173701 2017-12-29 20:15:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot The problem, though, is a lot of students are probably out of town.
946836896646422528 2017-12-29 20:14:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HarrisonWier @CoreyElliot The new arena will help, but that's down the line
946836476905639936 2017-12-29 20:13:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Progress....minimal progress, but progress nonetheless.
946814766831558657 2017-12-29 18:46:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 He said it should be earlier, which I find interesting.
946795117859524609 2017-12-29 17:28:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @JasonLaCanfora Exactly, good producers (I was one) understand both sides, as do good guests.
946789970097967104 2017-12-29 17:08:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Completely
946789723967762433 2017-12-29 17:07:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HelmetBoy_Texas Agreed
946761100309204993 2017-12-29 15:13:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> Conference play begins today for @TexasMBB in the Big 12.  In other words.....pic.twitter.com/mhJsoG2afK

946753582422020096 2017-12-29 14:43:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @smartfootball It depends on which sports talk you listen to/watch.....
946749157108273153 2017-12-29 14:26:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ahammsportsgeek The comments, though....
946595178055421952 2017-12-28 04:14:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DreamShakeSBN @Josh_wolf30 It's the @NBA. They never call travelling
946594373155934208 2017-12-28 04:11:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones Still with you....
946589995342680064 2017-12-28 03:53:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @rushgotjokes They weren't blatant flops. Harden pushed off like he usually does and got busted for it....twice.
946589733907521538 2017-12-28 03:52:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @rushgotjokes Lol, ok....
946589596858667008 2017-12-28 03:52:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Defended him perfectly....got into his body, knowing he would push off.
946589222202376193 2017-12-28 03:50:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @rushgotjokes Let's also not act like Harden doesn't get the VAST majority of calls, shall we?
946588940311715840 2017-12-28 03:49:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @rushgotjokes Sure, that happens....doesn't make what Harden did eiher time any less of a foul, though.
946587821757861888 2017-12-28 03:44:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @rushgotjokes A foul is a foul, regardless of time left on the clock.
946587127701262336 2017-12-28 03:42:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @rushgotjokes Nah....both were good calls, just usually not called.
946586585071529985 2017-12-28 03:40:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JMV1070 2nd one was legit. 1st one was questionable.
946583861491916801 2017-12-28 03:29:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival One of the worst penalties I've ever seen....and the explanation to Herman about it actually made it worse.
946548909609975808 2017-12-28 01:10:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @statesman @miguelevision !!!!!
946514859902078976 2017-12-28 22:55:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @Bitterwhiteguy IMO, He is FAR more intelligent and informed than Trump has ever thought about being....not that that's a high bar to clear.
946512858841526273 2017-12-28 22:47:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @abrandenburg10 @Jrbacon50 they are making a similar assumption that I'm not as sure about.
946512479902928898 2017-12-28 22:45:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @Jrbacon50 Shhhh....I haven't announced yet.
946512184221339648 2017-12-28 22:44:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @abrandenburg10 @Jrbacon50 You're assuming Mark would run as a Democrat....

946497838082592768 2017-12-28 21:47:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris The disrespect last night during the Texas Bowl  must have had you grinning from ear to ear, hehehe.
946489999620485120 2017-12-28 21:16:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UT_Bianco My deepest condolences to you and your family, John.
946476395324215298 2017-12-28 20:22:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @_delconte How can I run an idea for @TexasMBB & @TexasWBB by you that I believe could help increase fan support/buzz/attendance?
946475116715806722 2017-12-28 20:17:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markschlereth This guy is a top-level idiot. Also, based on his comments thus far, his twitter handle is probably more anatomically correct than he intended.
946473692057436160 2017-12-28 20:11:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Quite intriguing to my mind....
946473264687304704 2017-12-28 20:09:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Figured as much....
946473149461299200 2017-12-28 20:09:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Hmmm....what other part of life in Texas does that remind you of?
946472920024481793 2017-12-28 20:08:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Discerning list...
946469938289627137 2017-12-28 19:56:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrissyteigen That event is a people-watching extravaganza
946461310891511808 2017-12-28 19:22:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @ToddMalcolm23 Look at the numbers. They agree with me. I didn't say they were great, but they did improve.
946459094369660928 2017-12-28 19:13:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @ToddMalcolm23 The defense did get better after Charlie took over last season.
946428731937222657 2017-12-28 17:12:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dcapodice @bomani_jones They weren't, but they were good enough to win if the defense had shown up.
946428010173030400 2017-12-28 17:09:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @dcapodice Should have beaten OSU also. The Maryland game is a bit of an outlier to me, because no one else saw that Maryland team the rest of the season due to their injuries. Also, the defense was the major issue that day, not the offense.
946426746370437120 2017-12-28 17:04:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @dcapodice The OL & QB injuries were obviously a major issue, but let's not act like the problems on offense weren't also coaching-related.
946426431327883266 2017-12-28 17:03:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones Funny part is, the defense was the bigger problem last year.
946424531043995648 2017-12-28 16:56:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones True
946420033374375936 2017-12-28 16:38:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones It's obvious he made some poor choices for his offensive coaching staff.
946419448629616640 2017-12-28 16:35:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones I agree, and you could see how close they were to 8-10. Injuries and questionable coaching on offense prevented that.
946418735644061696 2017-12-28 16:33:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones Fair....however, it's still worth being happy about since it's the 1st winning record in 4 years & the 1st bowl win in 6, but yes....it isn't something to be puffing chests out over.
946417568528715777 2017-12-28 16:28:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Crimealytics @jeffchaley @USCocksman Of course....
946415313125564417 2017-12-28 16:19:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones And....now let's see if there is noticeable progress in year two.
946414770659495942 2017-12-28 16:17:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones There is no doubt that there are still things that need to be addressed and questions that need to be answered, but there is also no doubt that there was on-field improvement this year.
946409654967513090 2017-12-28 15:56:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl This is 100% not true.
946408851699625984 2017-12-28 15:53:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @Ian_A_Boyd It isn't a huge deal. However, it's never a good look for a head coach to mock an opposing player.

946276325525946369 2017-12-27 07:07:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ify_loves_fresh I believe a head coach should be above that stuff, is all. Set the example.
946275525055668225 2017-12-27 07:04:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ify_loves_fresh For a head coach to mock an opposing player? Yes.
946272811462594561 2017-12-27 06:53:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @GTOphil Obviously, a lot of Texas fans on Twitter are as well tonight.....
946269459609718784 2017-12-27 06:39:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF Never said I was pissed, but I've seen Texas fans' reaction to something similar from opposing coaches, and it was less than polite.
946268402917756930 2017-12-27 06:35:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF Ok, be real....if an opposing head coach did this towards a Texas player, you would be irate.
946267981780221953 2017-12-27 06:34:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> The refs told Tom Herman that they called the penalty on Daniel Young because he "Got up too hard". LOL - un-freaking-real.....

946266128636096512 2017-12-27 06:26:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ify_loves_fresh There isn't, but there is still a point where you can go too far
946265867674845185 2017-12-27 06:25:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I never said he couldn't have fun or celebrate
946265422369783808 2017-12-27 06:23:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @caromero0101 @Hornsforlife You're in the minority there among Texas fans.

946264561522479104 2017-12-27 06:20:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 1st thing - Not a rival, ESPN.  2nd thing - This isn't about Mizzou fans being upset. It's about the head coach setting an example.
946263858259296256 2017-12-27 06:17:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @caromero0101 @RMissita Players are different from coaches
946263389092962304 2017-12-27 06:15:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @Tommy4horns @98horn Texas fans would lose their shit (and have) if an opposing head coach did that.
946262875852730368 2017-12-27 06:13:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @Tommy4horns Ok, you apparently can't read. Buh-bye....
946262607794704385 2017-12-27 06:12:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Let me make this as clear as I can....  I have no problem with the players doing that, but the head coach should be above that fray.
946261679117078528 2017-12-27 06:08:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @caromero0101 I understand, but Texas fans would lose their shit if another team's coach did that to one of Texas' players.
946261269119717376 2017-12-27 06:07:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @Tommy4horns I'm uptight because I think it's a bad look for my school's head coach to mock an opposing player? Um, ok then.....

946260003048083456 2017-12-27 06:02:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @swervin66 You are in the minority there.

946259175809564672 2017-12-27 05:59:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @Tommy4horns For the players? Nothing....but the head coach needs to be above that fray.
946258988127145984 2017-12-27 05:58:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @ToddMalcolm23 Still a bad look by the head coach. Players? Fine....but not the head coach.

946257640392404993 2017-12-27 05:52:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CodyDanielSBN I didn't say it was a big deal.
946257208190357504 2017-12-27 05:51:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CodyDanielSBN It's a bad look for the head coach to mock a player on the other team. Period.
946256893525352448 2017-12-27 05:49:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 You're right, Nate, but the head coach should refrain from that. Not a good look.....

946251483317784576 2017-12-27 05:28:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn @JetSweeps The reliance on outside zone blocking still astounds me, because Texas sucks at it.

946240154339086336 2017-12-27 04:43:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Texas OL back to being Texas OL
946239844006719488 2017-12-27 04:42:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HornSports You should be able to rely on competenr officiating.
946239284499107841 2017-12-27 04:40:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HornSports Herman also needs to work the refs on holding when Mizzou is on offense.
946238914192429061 2017-12-27 04:38:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS The biggest play if the drive had yet ANOTHER uncalled, blatant holding penalty.
946238552253313024 2017-12-27 04:37:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 These refs have missed 3 or 4 blatant, obvious holds on Mizzou.
946238294068785153 2017-12-27 04:36:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 And got away with a hold
946237540801052673 2017-12-27 04:33:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HornSports Another blatant hold....missed.
946237026302611457 2017-12-27 04:31:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Jesus Vahe....
946236413921685505 2017-12-27 04:28:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Actually, the play calls on that series were fine, but the OL was God-awful.
946235604169297920 2017-12-27 04:25:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 The OL has shown up for Texas....unfortunately.

946227633653714946 2017-12-27 03:53:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF Actually, I'm still pissed about that ludicrous penalty that cost Texas points.
946225652180639744 2017-12-27 03:45:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I'm still blown away by that penalty....

946224529818386433 2017-12-27 03:41:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> How, in the name of all that is holy, is that a penalty on the RUNNING BACK????
946222614070128641 2017-12-27 03:33:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Yes it did
946218978090930176 2017-12-27 03:19:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I disagree that that's all they can do.  That's just what Beck calls.
946218494055665665 2017-12-27 03:17:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 He made a bad read. Double shallow crosses, but Moore was much more open and would have had the 1st down.
946217322909454336 2017-12-27 03:12:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 It's borderline

946213075446910977 2017-12-27 02:55:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattmosley Elingher lost some trust after the Tech game because he did not take care of the ball.
946211840765452288 2017-12-27 02:50:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Definitely
946208794001985538 2017-12-27 02:38:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HornSports Except it's what they have been doing for the last month of the season.

943136631489552384 2017-12-19 15:11:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RickyDoyle @HoughMagicDragn @OccupyLF It's part of it, but sadly....not as big a part as you'd think, IMO.
942986875593207808 2017-12-18 05:16:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF @RickyDoyle Seemed like your original point was giving him all the blame.
942982678097420288 2017-12-18 04:59:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 You're right about the Big 10.
942982573910831104 2017-12-18 04:59:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I think Michigan is an average team.
942981835725864960 2017-12-18 04:56:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Michigan isn't that good. Texas had to play like dogshit on offense for them to win by single-digits. Kansas is down (for them) this year, but they're still better than Michigan.
942980722717020160 2017-12-18 04:51:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 They're better than Michigan.
942978251898740736 2017-12-18 04:41:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RickyDoyle @OccupyLF @brad_gohornsbkw Really? All contested huh? Ok....
942977936998715392 2017-12-18 04:40:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF @RickyDoyle I agree, but that isn't what is being discussed.

942973924224225280 2017-12-18 04:24:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RickyDoyle @OccupyLF No, but I realize a good chunk of the blame has to go to the players on the court who aren't executing. You're giving them a free pass.
942973385029619712 2017-12-18 04:22:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @HornSports They do need to shoot less 3s, but since they're missing open ones, teams are taking away driving and passing lanes to the inside by packing in on defense.
942972323656884224 2017-12-18 04:18:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RickyDoyle @OccupyLF @brad_gohornsbkw Draw up a succesful offensive play that doesn't require hitting shots. Go ahead.....
942972032005885953 2017-12-18 04:17:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RickyDoyle @OccupyLF A coach can draw up all the plays in the world. If your players can't hit shots, it doesn't matter what you draw up.
942971669051789312 2017-12-18 04:15:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I agree, but Young is supposed to be a shooter. So are Febres & Davis, but none of them can hit consistently. They need more scoring from Coleman, and SOMEONE has to start finding some range.
942971081656283141 2017-12-18 04:13:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RickyDoyle @OccupyLF This team was packing in a matchup zone the entire game, DARING Texas to hit jumpers. They couldn't do it. Then, the few times they did get it inside the zone, they weren't consistently hitting the shorties, either. Blame the players.
942970332369080320 2017-12-18 04:10:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 Because no one can consistently hit a jumper, and when they were getting inside, guys were missing bunnies or turning it over. Pretty simple, really....
942969583253716993 2017-12-18 04:07:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF What do you recommend Shaka do when no one can consistently make an outside shot? He can't shoot it for them. @RickyDoyle
942965745264353280 2017-12-18 03:52:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Much harder to press off of missed shots, though....
942965240777539590 2017-12-18 03:50:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS Gotta make shots to do so
942959501480812544 2017-12-18 03:27:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @MBHORNSFAN @jkbtjc_53 Um, he didn't threaten you.
942959038635085826 2017-12-18 03:25:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS He's pressing
942859978834104320 2017-12-18 20:51:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NFL @Mr4thAndLong It probably gets reduced to 1 on appeal.
942814734050570240 2017-12-18 17:52:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Hey, it's all about content.... @PaulPabst @HiMyNameIsSeton @dpshow @andrewperloff
942644531887050753 2017-12-17 06:35:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @jab23j I disagree
942635366816854016 2017-12-17 05:59:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @jab23j That doesn't mean they're correct. Just look at what they believe constitutes a catch....
942633493284249600 2017-12-17 05:51:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @jab23j Feel free to give him credit. I do not.
942633375860486144 2017-12-17 05:51:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @jab23j For forcing a fumble? No.

942627104767774720 2017-12-17 05:26:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @Freerangebison The endzone is treated differently than the 100 yards from goal line to goal line.
942626369275432960 2017-12-17 05:23:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @jab23j Saw every second of it....including replays. Heath forced him wider than he wanted to go and bumped him as he lunged. Carr fumbled because he tried to do too much and didn't secure the ball in the process. Heath was a factor in the play, but did not cause the fumble.
942625680034009088 2017-12-17 05:20:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SethDavisHoops One thing we do know.....  The Big 12 is an unbelievable gauntlet.
942624432727748609 2017-12-17 05:15:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @Freerangebison Why should they retain possession?
942624157992353792 2017-12-17 05:14:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @jab23j And?
942623932099825664 2017-12-17 05:13:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JohnCornyn You don't even speak for Texans, so.....
942622944399974402 2017-12-17 05:09:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @jab23j Show me where Heath jarred that ball loose in any way whatsoever.

942620373211930624 2017-12-17 04:59:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SNFonNBC @TonyDungy How and to what do you change the "fumble into and out of the endzone" rule?
942619778581135360 2017-12-17 04:57:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen What would you do to change it? I think the rule is fine, but please defend your stance.
942618861723095042 2017-12-17 04:53:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> Dallas did almost everything they could to lose that game, but somehow hung on.  8-6.....still in the mix. @dallascowboys
942618540007452672 2017-12-17 04:52:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FO_ASchatz There is nothing wrong with that rule.

942614024788815872 2017-12-17 04:34:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> Morris has been terrible since the 1st Q. Dancing and hesitating instead of hitting the hole

942604096535703552 2017-12-17 03:55:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimCowlishaw The ground helped him secure that catch, but you're right....

942594903019806721 2017-12-17 03:18:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gjspittle 3rd down defense was horriffic on that drive.
942594048648507393 2017-12-17 03:15:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving 3rd down nightmares....
942592119348318208 2017-12-17 03:07:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Damien Wilson got straight tackled
942586512285290496 2017-12-17 02:45:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Unfortunately (similar to the Dez catch), that isn't how the league views it.
942585846791901186 2017-12-17 02:42:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB The NFL has made it clear (quite incorrectly, IMO) that process of the catch trumps breaking the plane of the goal line.
942585503211311104 2017-12-17 02:41:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JuddLegum How long of a list do you want?
942584361043595264 2017-12-17 02:36:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BostonGlobe @Dan_Shaughnessy Learn what? The Pats were gifted that game.
942581679054643205 2017-12-17 02:25:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB The application of the rule isn't the issue, it's the rule itself. It is simply wrong.
942581036034093056 2017-12-17 02:23:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr It is hard for me to eloquently emote how horrible Jeff Heath is.
942579797280030720 2017-12-17 02:18:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal The Cowboys have used their #2 RB on the 3rd drive of the game all season long.
942579108827074560 2017-12-17 02:15:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Smith was in on the whole drive

942573883735134208 2017-12-17 01:55:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA You wrote your opinion....not necessarily the truth.
942566022334345216 2017-12-17 01:23:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MikePereira The. Rule. Is. Bad.  It is flat-out wrong, and it needs to be changed.
942552954573336576 2017-12-17 00:31:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> Trying to extend the ball across the goal line is a football move.....period. As long as you have established possession on the ground, that should count.
942552259891736576 2017-12-17 00:29:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinHogan The @NFL catch rule is, and has been, broken for years now.
942551572478820352 2017-12-17 00:26:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JasonMinnix The @NFL no longer knows what a catch is
942550507423399936 2017-12-17 00:22:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @NFL the only level of football where a catch somehow isn't a catch.

941761019424198657 2017-12-15 20:04:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @TexasCB I think it is a lot more of the 1sy than the 2nd, but the 2nd does exist, in large part, because of Trump's unfounded attacks on the media as as a whole.

941041059269894144 2017-12-13 20:24:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman @WWMcClyde It's possible, yes, but the stadium would be a major issue in trying to do that
941040757326123008 2017-12-13 20:22:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman @WWMcClyde Well, the way the Marlins have presented it, Jeter is the one making all the baseball decisions.
941034622854553600 2017-12-13 19:58:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @USCocksman Jeter doesn't know what the hell he's doing, bottom line....
940977462040817664 2017-12-13 16:11:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival I probably watched that 10 times.....laughed every time.

940770034896515072 2017-12-12 02:27:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I literally yelled "What are you doing???" From my seat at the FEC.
940767940361760770 2017-12-12 02:18:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 All good....had a buddy cancel on me.

940767013181558784 2017-12-12 02:15:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Think Hickory-South Bend Central
940766867089711104 2017-12-12 02:14:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy This may resemble Hickory-South Bend Central

940663133332533254 2017-12-12 19:22:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny When you think about it, every gift except the rings ends up being a freaking hassle, because you have to find/build housing for 23 birds & 8 cows & then find a way to put up 50 extra people. At least the maids & geese are providing some sustenance for these people.

940444900830662656 2017-12-11 04:55:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch I really enjoy the draft process, but the season becomes a grind.

940432239946543106 2017-12-11 04:04:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @KevinWC7 He hasn't shown it at the big-league level.
940432097495437312 2017-12-11 04:04:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JuddLegum @JonathanWHendry That doesn't change the misleading nature of the tweet when you read the whole story that he posted.
940431843463237632 2017-12-11 04:03:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde You do realize I agreed with you, that The Godfather was definitely the better movie, right?
940431215546466304 2017-12-11 04:00:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I disagree that they're not in the same solar system, but movies, like music, are subjective.
940431053826732032 2017-12-11 04:00:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @KevinWC7 Rougie's potential is still there as well. My point is, Profar has never shown anything that says he would be better than Rougie at the plate. However, both guys are still quite young.
940429719815716864 2017-12-11 03:54:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinWC7 @onestrikeaway I am not going to try and spin Odor's terrible yesr last year, but his wRC+ was 106 in 2016, so.....
940427865245605888 2017-12-11 03:47:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinWC7 @onestrikeaway He's not even close from a power standpoint.
940427663742853120 2017-12-11 03:46:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinWC7 @onestrikeaway Yet he has been when he has been given a couple of extended looks.
940427183146913793 2017-12-11 03:44:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @KevinWC7 Defensively? Probably, but there's no evidence he is at the plate.
940426731227373568 2017-12-11 03:42:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JuddLegum You're being misleadingly selective with your quotes here, Judd.
940421156565331968 2017-12-11 03:20:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasVolleyball @NCAAVolleyball @Bubunectar @mauivolleyball7 The committees rationale for giving Kentucky a top 4 seed was dumb to begin with. (I.e win over common opponent FL).   The issue is Kentucky had 2 chances to beat FL. They went 1-1. Texas and Nebraska only had 1 chance.   Not to mention, TEX beat Kansas twice. KU swept Kentucky
940421066782117890 2017-12-11 03:20:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasVolleyball @NCAAVolleyball @Bubunectar @mauivolleyball7 Texas or Nebraska should have received a top 4 seed over Kentucky.   The SEC getting 2 of the top 4 seeds over the Pac 12/Big 10 and Big 12 winner was an absolute joke.   The SEC is at best the 3rd or 4th best conference in the country.
940420124900757504 2017-12-11 03:16:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Godfather is definitely the best of those 4, but Hoosiers isn't that far behind.

940417839109943298 2017-12-11 03:07:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thEMANacho Now, that part, I agree with. Was it the mom who threw out the GFM? I have only seen the sister on Twitter thanking people for words of support or things being offered (not money).
940414050898513921 2017-12-11 02:52:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> Every good, principled Conservative should be lambasting the support of @MooreSenate by the @GOP. The man is completely unfit to be a senator.https://twitter.com/politico/status/940413165468299265

940408645577269248 2017-12-11 02:31:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thEMANacho Brother, I got nothing but love for both you and Kenny, but y'all should show some evidence before you go accusing a kid of that

939927929051639808 2017-12-10 18:40:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Because of the blanket statement you made about it
939927734259765248 2017-12-10 18:40:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Very true....I'm just wondering why he didn't walk on at OU if he was so gung-ho Sooner?
939927077838557185 2017-12-10 18:37:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I didn't say I want it, but if it were to come back, why would the schools do anything other than home & home?

939593437145370624 2017-12-09 20:31:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott What is being reported is he is the AD over both.
939593102498680834 2017-12-09 20:30:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott So, I guess she is willing to take a demotion then?

939242197429444609 2017-12-08 21:16:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 I just about wrecked the car, from laughter, after those bear comments
939228486853685250 2017-12-08 20:21:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport @Evan_P_Grant @lonestarball So is that a "They'll re-sign him if the price is right"?
939228146494246913 2017-12-08 20:20:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @NewbergReport @lonestarball Do the Rangers make a serious run at re-signing Darvish now?

939206820798914560 2017-12-08 18:55:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith It's the little things in life that make us happy.   Or in this case, it's the lack of little things.
939205244059357184 2017-12-08 18:49:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChristineHookEm Gonna have to disagree with you on that one
939204680038699008 2017-12-08 18:46:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChristineHookEm Oh it was fine....  Austin just overreacts A LOT to such things.

938151973353938944 2017-12-05 21:03:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith I asked how long of a list they wanted
938144242446237698 2017-12-05 20:33:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LongHornFrenzy A 2018 Corvette that they levereged themselves to the hilt to buy in a last-ditch effort to make themselves look big-time. They don't stay for dinner becuase they don't want to hear family asking how they can afford that car and how that purchase may not have been the best idea.

937924667918159872 2017-12-04 06:00:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @GOP should be ashamed of itself and what it has become. They are lost.....and possibly irredeemably so.

937906085847093248 2017-12-04 04:46:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Oh yeah....Burfict might pack a damn shank in his pants

937892657623379968 2017-12-04 03:53:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chelseahandler It's a nice sentiment that you feel this way, and I truly hope you're proven right. However, I have little faith in the voters of that backwards-ass state
937878258531618817 2017-12-04 02:56:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @catosterman I will take that as a yes

937869189020311552 2017-12-04 02:20:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot I don't know if he would go that high, but he could work into the 1st round.
937861497757294593 2017-12-04 01:49:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SpecNewsATX @chrisgb00 @josephcook89 I think Hill could imrpove his stock somewhat by coming back and having a "clean" year, but his off-field issues are going to be a knock against him regardless of when he goes.

937854807091695616 2017-12-04 01:23:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KnowTheGame60 @BarkingCarnival He and #ScipioTex are the two grand wordsmiths of the Longhorn interwebs
937853286857822210 2017-12-04 01:17:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot Yes
937812276232511490 2017-12-04 22:34:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot I get that, but these were expected, so that's why myself and others aren't really reacting much.
937805811698622466 2017-12-04 22:08:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot This is not a surprise. None of the ones so far have been....

937382412547514368 2017-12-03 18:05:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Why is USC not part of this discussion? They should be.
937349183450775552 2017-12-03 15:53:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CNN @ABC @CJNitkowski @TheLesNozzle I've inserted zero bias into this. You're assuming I have. This is about obviously differing definitions as to what constitutes "Fake News".
937348103987920897 2017-12-03 15:49:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CJNitkowski Prove it.
937348055422132224 2017-12-03 15:49:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheLesNozzle @CJNitkowski We obviously have different definitions of what "Fake News" is.
937347920080359424 2017-12-03 15:48:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CNN @ABC @CJNitkowski @DCronin17 I'm not defending what happened.
937347798349033473 2017-12-03 15:48:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CNN @ABC @CJNitkowski @TheLesNozzle You and I have different definitions of what "Fake News" is then.
937347225193205767 2017-12-03 15:46:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CJNitkowski And you're 100% sure about that? You know the man? You know, without question, that's what he did?
937346942354513921 2017-12-03 15:45:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CNN @ABC @CJNitkowski @TheLesNozzle So, anytime anyone makes a mistake in an element of a story that's being reported, you consider that "Fake News"?
937345686588329984 2017-12-03 15:40:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CJNitkowski As do I. When you say it was ignored, you're implying intent, which in this case is an assumption on your part.
937345465804259329 2017-12-03 15:39:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CNN @ABC @CJNitkowski @TheLesNozzle Wrong. That is not what fake news is.
937344947669405696 2017-12-03 15:37:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CNN @ABC @CJNitkowski @TheLesNozzle Irresponsible? Yes. Fake? No.
937344756182593538 2017-12-03 15:36:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CJNitkowski You're making a grand assumption in saying their standard practices were ignored. Again, making a mistake is not "Fake News".
937344093147074560 2017-12-03 15:33:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CNN @ABC @CJNitkowski Making an error in a story, then correcting that mistake is not "fake news". Be better, CJ.

937191358045081601 2017-12-02 05:26:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant You might want to include USC in this poll

937007230314074113 2017-12-02 17:15:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RalphStrangis @RedRaiderInCO Actually no....it's #Righty that expects this, despite all evidence to the contrary, and the ones that know this won't happen flat-out lie about it, saying that it will.
936834535274119168 2017-12-01 05:48:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @McClain_on_NFL @randyharvey They can't REALLY afford it, but they're pushing all their chips and leveragong themselves to the hilt in the hopes it pays off.
936815388964175872 2017-12-01 04:32:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @xnulz How long of a list do you want?
936734047845470209 2017-12-01 23:09:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Look, there's no question that this is an upgrade for A&M. As to how big of an upgrade it is? Only time will tell.
936733740088340480 2017-12-01 23:08:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Oh he is, in certain areas at least. Other areas? Not as much
936733275271389185 2017-12-01 23:06:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 To be fair, FSU also wasn't delivering on promises they had made to him about facilities
936680423844909056 2017-12-01 19:36:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> Number of days without a member of Congress or citizen of  the state of Texas embarrassing the state on a national level:  Zero
936679499856601094 2017-12-01 19:32:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RawStory @Special_KGM The Alabama senate election hasn't happened yet. Wait for it....
936650012318199810 2017-12-01 17:35:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> The Aggies may very well sign Jimbo Fisher to be their new head coach, and if they do... congratulations to them. However, anyone who thinks that the A&M job is as good or better than the FSU job needs to step back & drink a big glass of perspective, because you're lacking it.
936628994237222912 2017-12-01 16:12:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> If you would like to make some extra cash refereeing a flag football tournament tomorrow afternoon in Austin, hit me up.

936463749162196993 2017-11-30 05:15:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @expo1310 @corbydavidson I still remember the line about Expo from @theoldgreywolf after giving out the call-in number during the open for "The Hardline"....  "Your presentation must pass mustard with him before it ever sees the light of day with us."
936462562656387072 2017-11-30 05:10:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @expo1310 @corbydavidson The great Expo....my inspiration for wanting to produce sports talk radio. He was the drop master.

936434288718999552 2017-11-30 03:18:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> 3rd & 2.....shotgun spread, motion to empty set.  Dammit, Linehan.... @dallascowboys
936433804880826368 2017-11-30 03:16:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JHopkinsSD @BudElliott3 @OboGweny It is a lesser program. This would not even be a sideways move for Jimbo....if he makes it.
936428632263811073 2017-11-30 02:55:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters He has that side. It's his job to see it. He was playing to far towards the middle. Also, Heath is just terrible.
936428218302849026 2017-11-30 02:54:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> Blatant, obvious, uncalled holds by @dallascowboys opponents is REALLY getting on my nerves.

936426980282699777 2017-11-30 02:49:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters Oh, and the uncalled hold on the 3rd down play.
936426896811790338 2017-11-30 02:49:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters That TD was on Heath
936422210838941696 2017-11-30 02:30:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde One of those was deep in their own end of the field though, so think of it as saving at least 3.
936367564397207553 2017-11-30 22:53:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist @StevieJtheReal It also doesn't mean he can.

936363229797896192 2017-11-30 22:36:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dpbrugler @DeMarcusWare @JJT_Journalist @TaiwanDavis I have looked at the player as well as the scheme. I disagree that TJ Watt is "exceptional". He may prove me wrong over time, but that is my current opinion of him. However, I do believe that being in the Steelers' system puts him in the best position possible to succeed.

936359004074336257 2017-11-30 22:19:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DeMarcusWare @JJT_Journalist @TaiwanDavis No, not really....not on the level of athlete he was coming out of college last year. He was not on the same level as Demarcus Ware.
936358196238745601 2017-11-30 22:16:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist @StevieJtheReal We're discussing TJ, not JJ. Two different players & levels of athlete
936357790553165825 2017-11-30 22:14:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DeMarcusWare @JJT_Journalist @TaiwanDavis TJ Watt isn't the same level of athlete that Ware was.

936353176332177408 2017-11-30 21:56:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He doesn't have much to lose at this point.
936350549859098629 2017-11-30 21:45:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jimmykimmel Roy, you are neither Christian, nor do you embody Christian values. You are a raging hypocrite & charlatan using Christianity to boost your personal ambitions. You give true Christians a bad name. Your lunacy needs to be put to an end.
936348033171763202 2017-11-30 21:35:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr If he does this all weekend (a complete tournament) then we can talk.

936338436872601601 2017-11-30 20:57:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @hughhewitt So, Mr. Hewitt, with your stance on "zero tolerance", will you now call on @realDonaldTrump to step down?
936334893533057024 2017-11-30 20:43:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist People who keep bringing up Watt vs Taco don't seem to understand that PIT & DAL run two completely different systems. Watt is a GREAT fit for their defense....not so much here.

936326111910334464 2017-11-30 20:08:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KLR_doce Brother, you are preaching to the choir. @UTAustin Parking & Traffic exists to fleece the student body as well as those who have to work on campus. The worst part is the attitude everyone in the office has towards people. They basically DGAF.

935981874723348482 2017-11-29 21:20:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jemelehill The way you are applying this statement (throwing the blanket over our entire gender), is just plain wrong.  Are there a lot of men who are like this? Too many men? Without question....but there a also A LOT of men who are NOT this way.   This is a very poor generalization.
935964664290271232 2017-11-29 20:12:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal What, exactly, is your point here? Because I'll be honest with you....what it seems like you're arguing is a really bad look for you
935963939753680896 2017-11-29 20:09:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JenksNBCS @VeggieTart This is a very poor take because she is basically applying this statement to our entire gender, which is absolutely not true

935582901881769984 2017-11-28 18:55:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers The A&M job has never been on the same level as FSU by any measuring stick used to rank those jobs. This is just simple fact.

934927995562840066 2017-11-26 23:32:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps @SheaInIrving None at all....  Now, I have no doubt A&M will try to money-whip him somehow, but the whole thing about his son's medical condition is going to cause him to leave to be closer to the hospitals in Houston? I don't buy it.
934926111158489088 2017-11-26 23:25:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving @JetSweeps I just can't believe that things are so bad in Tallahassee that Fisher would take a step back, job-wise like that.

934262625189457920 2017-11-24 03:29:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LongHornFrenzy That and their ass-kicking is tomorrow.
934262289921925121 2017-11-24 03:27:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBNationCFB @Big12Conference ^^^
934261533596684289 2017-11-24 03:24:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> The Texas OL should be ashamed of themselves right now.
934260444579147777 2017-11-24 03:20:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HornSports Young scored (would have scored) on the play they blew dead.
934257954953588738 2017-11-24 03:10:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn And it cost Texas a TD
934257858245484545 2017-11-24 03:10:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HornSports The review cost Texas a TD
934252900188065793 2017-11-24 02:50:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DayDay409 Good
934250144979144704 2017-11-24 02:39:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KnowTheGame60 @Big12Conference ^^^
934249734298112002 2017-11-24 02:37:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JMichaelYoung1 This OL, even with Connor in there does not zone block worth a damn. Stop calling those plays.
934249195841703938 2017-11-24 02:35:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JMichaelYoung1 Not panic
934248320465285120 2017-11-24 02:32:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> This is like OSU all over again. OL is getting beat up front by a below-average DL, so now Beck is panicking and going back to grab-bag play-calling.
934247690833195009 2017-11-24 02:29:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports The fact that we ran that play from the 3 is VERY telling....
934247027768287232 2017-11-24 02:27:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Why Sam kept that, I have no idea....
934240343838674944 2017-11-24 02:00:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn He thought the safety would help but the safety came up on someone else. Just stay with him....you have no other responsibility
934226254286524416 2017-11-24 01:04:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot You can't blow a 16-point 2nd half lead....ever.

934206299520294914 2017-11-24 23:45:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Right, he hasn't played in one game this season. I would hope that he wouldn't check out just because he didn't play in one game
934205870975668224 2017-11-24 23:43:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB In game 5? Really?
934187384576663552 2017-11-24 22:30:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Please don't get blown out.... please don't get blown out.... please don't get blown out.... please don't get blown out....

934172735730864129 2017-11-24 21:31:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo You are familiar with this sport, right?
934168014026608640 2017-11-24 21:13:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @Marcus_Mosher Bottom 5
934167965943107585 2017-11-24 21:12:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers Big factor that one must consider with Marinelli....  Dallas bottom 5 (28th) in the NFL in terms of % of cap $ spent on defense.

934120865834422278 2017-11-24 18:05:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OBJ_3 @NFL @gstrong157 I didn't say it wasn't great, but winning the game is part of what makes something legendary.
934115994267725831 2017-11-24 17:46:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HelmetBoy_Texas That sad part is, she would probably thank you for that comparison.

934073620632096768 2017-11-24 14:58:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TomTheHerman Unfortunately, thanks to poor officiating, Texas Tech will have to wait until the second half to feel that tonight

933887416934551557 2017-11-23 02:38:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers It's not even that so much as his narcissistic, stubborn-as-a-mule refusal to close the damn curtains during the game when it's sunny.
933861940467785728 2017-11-23 00:56:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers Ok, I'll ask you the question I threw out.....who? What coach(es) do you pursue that you believe have a legitimate chance of coming here?
933861529988096002 2017-11-23 00:55:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 This has been some hideous basketball on offense, by both teams.

933850837188841472 2017-11-23 00:12:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> For those who have been calling for it, I am open to the idea of Jason Garrett being relieved of command, but the question that must be answered 1st is...."To hire whom?", Because remember who will be making the call on that hire and who still controls the franchise....

933840223234117632 2017-11-23 23:30:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> Absolutely zero adjustments on defense for the 3rd straight week

933444621073608704 2017-11-22 21:18:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodbabers @ZackRockatansky @JetSweeps I think Malik's speed and vastly improved instincts/football IQ already has scouts very intruiged. If he tests well during the draft process, he could get into the 1st round.

933121038317117440 2017-11-21 23:52:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @unclelukereal1 @JenksNBCS @Texasfight17 While Red McCombs is a big-money supporter of Texas, he is one voice of many, and there are a number of boosters who wield more influence than him. Red's comments were soundly and rightly panned when he made them. So no....he really didn't get it before either.

932136986130952192 2017-11-18 06:42:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 When Baker got to OU, for the first time in my life, I found myself rooting for an OU player to succeed (except against Texas), because I thought Tech really did him wrong. His jackassery, however, has caused that to erode during his time there.

932074043141914624 2017-11-18 02:32:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LongHornFrenzy A couple of things....  1) The SEC will never allow it to happen 2) That game would be a "1st team to 20 wins" kind of game
932072558979158016 2017-11-18 02:26:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 Yeah....that was Titanically dumb

932062703543300097 2017-11-18 01:47:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @firemedic1998 Probably a good idea to see the play before commenting....

932053475059470336 2017-11-18 01:10:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> I don't know how much play this got, but it was the back cover of the October @TexasMonthly. It moved me....a lot. Thank you @neworleans.pic.twitter.com/dn8SQVwSu4
932052155674124290 2017-11-18 01:05:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onlxn I just ignore @lenadunham. It makes things easier.

932031960565895169 2017-11-18 23:45:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Ok then
932031352043704322 2017-11-18 23:42:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Ok then....but you can rightly call something out without getting upset about it.
932030278582890496 2017-11-18 23:38:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott So, because he doesn't commit criminal acts, you're ok with assholic behavior? That is a pretty low bar to set, but ok....
932028806403063809 2017-11-18 23:32:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott When "unapologetically himself" means being a douchebag, no....I won't respect that. You are obviously free to, however, consider what it is you are giving respect to.
932027474690666496 2017-11-18 23:27:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Not an excuse....
932026504967544833 2017-11-18 23:23:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 He is such a DB, it's unreal.....

932013712449425408 2017-11-18 22:32:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 The coaching staff needs to explain why they think Cuney is a better option than Anderson at guard.
932013128333824000 2017-11-18 22:30:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Horrible
932011295204892673 2017-11-18 22:23:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde She calls the game very well, but the voice just grates on me.
932010684803698688 2017-11-18 22:20:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @rodofdisaster That was Elliott, not Jones
932010476732633089 2017-11-18 22:19:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde This is why QBs should not have W-L records. It is a HIGHLY overrated stat.
931985303308513280 2017-11-18 20:39:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde No doubt
931985247784374273 2017-11-18 20:39:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @rodofdisaster Well, Elliot....
931982177352454144 2017-11-18 20:27:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Defense was GREAT to day
931982016819671041 2017-11-18 20:26:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @jtsween88 Yes, but they will have selling to do before that bowl game.

931980708125597697 2017-11-18 20:21:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 7-5 (6-3) is something you can sell
931979455672832000 2017-11-18 20:16:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn If he would just LOOK for the ball......
931974618193293313 2017-11-18 19:57:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS And the officials are trying to help WVU win it
931974140604698624 2017-11-18 19:55:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> That TD is on the #Big12Refs. Trying to give thus game to WVU.
931972362223923205 2017-11-18 19:48:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> Big 12 officials are absolute GARBAGE!!!!

931590538792505344 2017-11-17 18:31:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @rensarns Actually, right now you are part of the problem....not understanding that it IS ok to kneel during the anthem, because they have the right to do so. Disagreeing with something doesn't make it not okay.
931587984557780992 2017-11-17 18:20:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @rensarns Nate has never claimed to be speaking for all veterans, gentlemen.

931585972793499648 2017-11-17 18:12:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 @justinwells2424 Blessing in disguise? Maybe that will force the staff to use more 10 personnel

930921841606131718 2017-11-15 22:13:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn It was similar but not exactly the same. However, Goodell and the league office still railroaded him.

929957359186862088 2017-11-12 06:21:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @TuDawg11 You frequently use the term 'libtard, then when called out for it you defended it by saying it is a medical term and posting a screenshot of a medical article using the term 'retardation' as if they were the same thing.
929954406828736512 2017-11-12 06:09:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @TuDawg11 I asked because in your series of tweets you seem to believe the medical term and the name-calling insult are the same, and therefore interchangeable.
929953680773799938 2017-11-12 06:06:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @TuDawg11 Are you going to answer my polite and quite serious question or are you just going to continue your semi-coherent ranting, while publicly battling the English language in tweet after tweet? #YourStruggleIsReal
929952062527426560 2017-11-12 06:00:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @TuDawg11 Serious question for you, EBT....do you understand the difference between using the term 'retardation' and calling someone a 'retard' or 'tard'?

929868260270522368 2017-11-12 00:27:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JasonMinnix They just don't have a quality replacement for him right now. Smith is basically a rookie and Durant is hurt. Lee, though, as we have now seen is 3 games, is the linchpin of this defense.
929866721506205696 2017-11-12 00:21:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JasonMinnix When the replacement for one of those 3 players almost single-handedly torpedoes your offense, this is what happens.
929866009846206464 2017-11-12 00:18:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ProFootballTalk He doesn't care
929865696619544576 2017-11-12 00:17:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @theoldgreywolf @oldwaver You're making a big assumption that actions actually occurred with this statement.

929854763063234560 2017-11-12 23:33:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers If you go play-action there, I can understand it, but straight up shotgun, 3-wide with no hint of anything other than pass?? Makes no sense at ALL!!
929854288209342465 2017-11-12 23:31:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist Green has been an embarrassment and Cooper has been bad as well.
929854126032412672 2017-11-12 23:31:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist This game has been much more about the OL than the RB
929853630634741767 2017-11-12 23:29:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers The 1st down play call from the 12 made ZERO sense. You go shotgun, straight pass after you have been gashing them?? WHY???

929493887185547269 2017-11-11 23:39:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden 30 yards in penalties tends to help
929490293874929664 2017-11-11 23:25:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Just add that to the list
929489409673781248 2017-11-11 23:21:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> Have fun with this one, Longhorn fans.....https://twitter.com/AggieFootball/status/929378192346853376
929477517244878848 2017-11-11 22:34:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Agreed. It gave the Big 12 a really positive unexpected story
929454702118473728 2017-11-11 21:04:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Big 12 officials are the worst in college football at calling holding. Meaning, they'll call holds that aren't. They don't know what it is.

929398957519843330 2017-11-11 17:22:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy And then he drunkenly calls a radio station to gripe about how Texas treated him
929397169626537984 2017-11-11 17:15:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EWErickson You have a very conflated sense of equivalency. Try again.
929237330472460288 2017-11-10 06:40:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mrBobbyBones It's an awards show. People seriously need to relax....
929209870544441344 2017-11-10 04:51:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @merib @RadioAmy I may test that theory over the next 24 hours, as I rolled the absolute hell out of my ankle tonight.
929208984720076800 2017-11-10 04:47:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasBaseball Try #LifetimeLonghorn instead. It flows better....

929200741251796992 2017-11-10 04:14:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert That was tongue-in-cheek of course, but I guess to my mind Foo Foo Fighters is a much better band than Wings
929200324736356352 2017-11-10 04:13:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert You just compare the Foo Fighters to Wings, which kind of makes me want to choke you right now
929174380445356032 2017-11-10 02:30:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JenksNBCS You look like you got caught doing something you shouldn't.....
929122298816278529 2017-11-10 23:03:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @srr50 @z4luvr Are you talking about the athletic department or the fan base? Those are two very different things.
929118632579424256 2017-11-10 22:48:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch @AnwarRichardson It all depends on what your definition of a "Christmas movie"is

929095986542252032 2017-11-10 21:18:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @srr50 @z4luvr You have a very distorted view of things, sir....and, to state the obvious, it's quite incorrect on a number of things.
929095463890051072 2017-11-10 21:16:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChristineHookEm Safe to say your Twitter week was just made?

928890665420902400 2017-11-09 07:42:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @z4luvr You should try to stick to conversation topics that you're more equipped to handle. Like say.....the level of fry quality at the local McDonald's. Leave the adult discussion the the adults.

927618822558896129 2017-11-06 19:28:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TAMU @TomTheHerman You? No....  A couple of your assistants? Hopefully....
927618136886652931 2017-11-06 19:26:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Tom is right. It is important....but not as important as performance & results.
927611727272964101 2017-11-06 19:00:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @stringsays_ LOL!!!!
927611641226825729 2017-11-06 19:00:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer Fine....we'll just call him Sean.
927610887946604545 2017-11-06 18:57:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris "They don't pay me to tackle"
927610728789479424 2017-11-06 18:56:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> Hey...@realjerryjones...how many times are you going to let this negatively affect your team before you stop this stupidity? @dallascowboyshttps://twitter.com/dmn_cowboys/status/927605134074482688
927605792055980034 2017-11-06 18:37:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr That late in the week means Zeke should play this week, yes?
927588794538307584 2017-11-06 17:29:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 pic.twitter.com/hrQwvsQSBq
927568325307138048 2017-11-06 16:08:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealGlenMacnow Wow, that's like choosing what kind of torture you want done to yourself
927567777203982337 2017-11-06 16:06:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GeorgeTakei It's about both, and both need to be addressed.
927567244921593856 2017-11-06 16:03:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidMooreDMN @dmn_cowboys I would argue he's more important
927417810711494656 2017-11-05 06:10:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoyBlunt Unfortunately, that's all that you have for them since you're a bought and paid for lackey of the @NRA
927417438253170689 2017-11-05 06:08:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NRA @SenThomTillis And that's apparently all you have since you're nothing but an @nra puppet.....
927417227438993408 2017-11-05 06:07:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SenatorBurr And that's all you'll do, because you've been bought like cattle by the @NRA
927410852944384000 2017-11-05 05:42:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JohnCornyn Empty words from an empty man.
927394528302194688 2017-11-05 04:37:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 I've known AJ too long not to know where he was going there, so I just waited.
927394045915291648 2017-11-05 04:35:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters Is this going to be like a Spring Game where the defense will also be awarded points for things other than TDs?
927383267430535168 2017-11-05 03:52:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 I think part of the reason you get no crap is because anyone who listens to you knows you don't care if you do & it won't affect you.
927382673869475840 2017-11-05 03:50:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 I think you generally see more real/honesty from local folks in most markets. Gaining national run (& fear of losing it) causes loss of real
927380825921990657 2017-11-05 03:43:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Damn right, and when a team proves you wrong like that, you applaud them and say "Well done. They really proved me wrong."
927380219547340800 2017-11-05 03:40:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Exactly. Are there those who pounce on you when you are wrong? Sure, but you have to accept that and not let it affect how you do the job.
927378305334030337 2017-11-05 03:33:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Btw, you guys do give that.
927378131777982465 2017-11-05 03:32:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 But when you are wrong, just own it and move forward. Unfortunately, far too often, that isn't how it gets handled.
927377819495288832 2017-11-05 03:31:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 And you know what? Fear of being wrong is big problem in this industry that causes a lot of this too, IMO. It's ok to be wrong.
927377192186728448 2017-11-05 03:28:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Agreed
927375218749952000 2017-11-05 03:20:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 I just want real...period. Whether I work with you or just follow you, whether I agree or disagree with you...Just give me real.
927372597561577472 2017-11-05 03:10:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 All too true, unfortunately. I've tried to be good about spotting the ones that do it more often than not in order to avoid/ignore them.
927369306719096832 2017-11-05 02:57:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jacrod79 @PhillyLonghorn @KTATX15 @uttailgaters It's always good to have friends to help us through these difficult times
927367501041885184 2017-11-05 02:50:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Sports media in general, or sports radio more specifically?
927363821735415808 2017-11-05 02:35:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanCBass Therein lies the problem. For the ones who are in the pocket of the @NRA, there's never a good time.
927363447012065285 2017-11-05 02:34:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NRA @SarahKSilverman @SeanCBass Absolutely....
927362956148596736 2017-11-05 02:32:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinHogan Erin, the frustrating part is....at least when it comes to guns....is that our elected leaders don't even make the attempt to do something.
927362023859552256 2017-11-05 02:28:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanCBass How many have to die before we do something? I just want to know....
927353904085397505 2017-11-05 01:56:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 The regular season and defense don't go together in the NBA
927352818213761029 2017-11-05 01:51:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jeff_Caplan He is a morally bankrupt, corrupt POS. That's how.....
927350248640602114 2017-11-05 01:41:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BloggingTheBoys Outside of a couple of plays today, Jones was fine, but he has had an up & down year. Heath has been awful all year.
927328776228392965 2017-11-05 00:16:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets We've been asking that for very good reasons. However, glad he finally made a play in Game 8.

927316237650100224 2017-11-05 23:26:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanCBass You're correct, but that coverage was terrible.
927308254891388929 2017-11-05 22:54:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr That wasn't a late hit. Terrible call.
927305791102771201 2017-11-05 22:45:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets You either call time out after the big play or you get down there quick to run something. Dallas did neither....
927302322325282816 2017-11-05 22:31:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Should have also been a better throw and the SUN SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN HIS EYES!!!

926216768653352960 2017-11-02 22:37:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KenTremendous TV ratings are lower across the board for everyone. Cord-cutting is the biggest reason.....for the NFL as well.

925932760983900160 2017-11-01 03:49:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher I've been paying close attention the last couple of seasons. It's been this way for a while now. Took a while, but I'm convinced it's time.
925931811141767168 2017-11-01 03:45:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher K-Zone's across being actually used across baseball is the only solution to this.

925866576745848832 2017-11-01 23:26:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @swish41 @ErinHogan @jeffarr07 Well, the Mavs haven't had much to cheer about since 2011, and when the Cowboys are good it can get lost in the wash.
925865399635398656 2017-11-01 23:21:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I never defended him, so I guess nowhere?

925529345040572417 2017-10-31 01:06:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MuslimIQ @wethinkwerefree My point is there are examples of extremists in nearly every religion ever created. Those people bastardize the religion to justify actions.

925433042788847621 2017-10-31 18:43:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BrianSchoeneman No sir, they cannot. Hamilton, Washington, et al did not decide to join a traitorous rebellion against the US in order to preserve slavery.
925432179135565824 2017-10-31 18:39:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TomTheHerman @BrianaMinter04 I think the victims want the people responsible held accountable, and the Baylor community to stand up for them more than the ex-head coach.

925063741691105280 2017-10-30 18:15:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall @MUAVeronicaS Serious question because I am genuinely curious: Why are folks so quick to dismiss the possibility that he actually might not remember this?

924845588495130624 2017-10-29 03:49:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @catosterman I'm a Rangers fan, and the Dodgers have Yu. I can't root for the Astros.

924836950430945282 2017-10-29 03:14:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AustinTx_wood @GregSwindell @KevinDunn01 My guess would be sliders require a tighter grip because it's a hard breaker?
924836207825211392 2017-10-29 03:11:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm They're all leaders. I can guarantee Watt & Mercilus view him as a leader even with his holdout.
924835441886597120 2017-10-29 03:08:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @alexdelbarrio @jaymelamm Fans and staff? Probably.... But players? Obviously not if they're letting him speak for them
924834736731836416 2017-10-29 03:05:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @alexdelbarrio @jaymelamm He's been a leader on that team for a few years. Him holding out for contract reasons doesn't change that in the eyes of the players.

924763304387600384 2017-10-29 22:22:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @TommySledge That was not a hold. Shit call....

924675091060883456 2017-10-29 16:31:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy This very salient point just further solidifies that Beck's base competency level is far below what is needed, and he needs to be gone.
924661962499338241 2017-10-29 15:39:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MFollowill just close?

924480033539969024 2017-10-28 03:36:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast @HoustonMark Next time try bringing up something more germane to your point. He's sucked in the post-season, bottom line.

924477632296701952 2017-10-28 03:26:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast @HoustonMark You brought up that he hadn't blown a home save this season as a reason to back up your argument even though it wasn't a save situation.
924475287185879040 2017-10-28 03:17:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm That is pretty solid....

924460254456352770 2017-10-28 02:17:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball No
924459575495086080 2017-10-28 02:15:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy IOW?
924458737267507200 2017-10-28 02:11:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Any thoughts on NFL games tomorrow ATS or O/U?
924457952790089728 2017-10-28 02:08:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Holy. Shit.
924457738528272385 2017-10-28 02:07:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jonmadani The Dodgers should have considered a squeeze in the top of the 6th.
924453875792433153 2017-10-28 01:52:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @RyanBridgesCFB "We're killing them on the ground, so they'll NEVER expect the pass!"
924451954474045446 2017-10-28 01:44:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball I will say lenient, because if they were going to suspend him, they should have done it tonight.
924450312693407745 2017-10-28 01:38:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UKFootball @NCAAFootball @rex_rexchapman The Big 12 is an absolute travesty in this respect.
924449707480494081 2017-10-28 01:36:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 You're correct about TCU's offense. With Hill at QB, if you can slow/shut down their run game (which Texas can), their O is ineffective.
924449392152797184 2017-10-28 01:34:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 That was damn funny....
924448335192260608 2017-10-28 01:30:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF Yes, but they've now given up 28.

924343509699715072 2017-10-28 18:34:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman @JenksNBCS Just pointing out we have more respect for a fake dead guy than we do the Texas OC.....and I agree with this, btw.
924341163125026817 2017-10-28 18:24:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS @WWMcClyde Already given away too many points today....

924338441952940033 2017-10-28 18:13:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Bue had Duvernay wide open to his right. Never looked that way....

924331986772221952 2017-10-28 17:48:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 The kick was too low, but yes....that was on the OL.
924331658899283968 2017-10-28 17:46:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 This game would already be over if our offense weren't so inept.
924328743677591552 2017-10-28 17:35:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Listen to Craig online
924327009660100608 2017-10-28 17:28:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Magic 8-ball says "Ask again later"
924326379251957763 2017-10-28 17:25:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jeffchaley I think the 3rd down quick-kick should be a part of our "offense"
924326239871098881 2017-10-28 17:25:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Nickelson ACTUALLY did a good job!!

924324769440325633 2017-10-28 17:19:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jeffchaley The trick plays have to actually work at some point, though.....
924165916820148224 2017-10-27 06:48:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm From the reports, they had to be talked into staying.
924152876057944064 2017-10-27 05:56:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Demo36 @Chron_MattYoung @dustinbennett76 Right....he did it. Yu is taking the high road. Yuli is apologizing, and will be talking to the commissioner tomorrow.
924151912982831104 2017-10-27 05:52:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Yes you can....and your reaction was on this level, my friend.
924150189438488576 2017-10-27 05:45:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @donlemon @Jeff_Caplan @RogerJStoneJr You seriously need counseling....both legal and emotional.

924146339096784896 2017-10-27 05:30:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Demo36 @Chron_MattYoung @dustinbennett76 I implied nothing of the sort.
924146182682705920 2017-10-27 05:29:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Demo36 @Chron_MattYoung @dustinbennett76 I have some beautiful oceanfront property in Arizona for sale. Interested?
924145666825302016 2017-10-27 05:27:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Demo36 @Chron_MattYoung @dustinbennett76 How, exactly? I said the news was what he was caught doing on video. I was correct.
924145398138228736 2017-10-27 05:26:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Demo36 @Chron_MattYoung @dustinbennett76 No, because it's correct. Catch up on the story.
924144763825254400 2017-10-27 05:24:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Demo36 @Chron_MattYoung @dustinbennett76 You need to catch up on the story. He is basically admitting he did this at this point.

924142629671047168 2017-10-27 05:15:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Demo36 @Chron_MattYoung @dustinbennett76 The news is what he was caught on video doing. The reactions/quotes from the parties involved/affected are additions to that news.

924139896289353728 2017-10-27 05:04:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn It's pretty despicable what I'm seeing in a number of timelines.
924138903896055809 2017-10-27 05:00:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn He won't get suspended. Fined maybe, but that's it. Either way, that was F-ed up, and the Astros fans defending/dismissing it are jackasses.
924136918794858497 2017-10-27 04:53:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal All the people on your TL defending Guriel, or dismissing what he did, need a serious kick in the ass.

923749231034355713 2017-10-26 03:12:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 Cuney is most-effective at center....and by that, I mean he is ok, because he is terrible at guard.

923584774391894016 2017-10-26 16:19:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AoDespair I have not asked, and would not expect, him to vote like a Democrat.
923584595035123713 2017-10-26 16:18:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AoDespair Really? During the campaign did he get up on the floor of the Senate and denounce him?
923584270295293952 2017-10-26 16:17:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AoDespair My point is still the same, though....these are just words with no actions to support them.

923254659405492225 2017-10-25 18:27:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WSJ @CashTumbles She wasn't in the shelter by choice. The government put her there.
923254442916503553 2017-10-25 18:26:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WSJ @CashTumbles Actually, I believe her attorney was paid for by the @ACLU
923254199336529921 2017-10-25 18:25:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WSJ @CashTumbles My apologies. I didn't get paywall blocked for whatever reason.
923250063744425989 2017-10-25 18:09:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @YahooForde Or a weird one....
923246244759265280 2017-10-25 17:53:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WSJ @CashTumbles It was not paid for by the government. Read the article.
923246042472239109 2017-10-25 17:53:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WSJ @CashTumbles They weren't allowing her to leave to go have the prodecure.
923244777688256512 2017-10-25 17:48:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WSJ @CashTumbles The case was about the government denying her access to facilities to have the prodecure, not who pays for it.
923243132413726726 2017-10-25 17:41:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WSJ @CashTumbles Her family.
923243051300065281 2017-10-25 17:41:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WSJ @DroppinTheMitts Her family did.

923008384135135232 2017-10-24 02:08:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kirkmin @jennifersterger @kyledowns1 @kenkenhall Here's one: In context with her other tweets, she used it as an example as how others in the industry, including women, enable the problem.
923007487619448832 2017-10-24 02:05:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kirkmin @jennifersterger @kyledowns1 @kenkenhall The misogynist calling me cowardly.....that's ironic.
923006924739698696 2017-10-24 02:02:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kirkmin @jennifersterger @kyledowns1 @kenkenhall You think those are the only choices? Wow, you're dense.....
923004741889806336 2017-10-24 01:54:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kirkmin @jennifersterger @kyledowns1 @kenkenhall Yes, because I am VERY VERY confident that you are wrong.
922996985526808576 2017-10-24 01:23:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kirkmin @jennifersterger @kyledowns1 @kenkenhall Here's a bright idea....why don't you ask her why  instead of inserting your own uninformed opinions about why?
922992653414879232 2017-10-24 01:06:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kirkmin @kyledowns1 @kenkenhall Ken Ken Ken  That has nothing to do with the assumption you made about @jennifersterger's reason behind her tweets.
922988513339035649 2017-10-24 00:49:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kirkmin @jennifersterger @kyledowns1 @kenkenhall "This really seems like someone trying desperately to stay relevant, and undermines all women that have suffered actual harassment." <--This
922986056970063873 2017-10-24 00:39:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kirkmin @jennifersterger @kyledowns1 @kenkenhall I read perfectly, thank you. This tweet does not change the fact that your assumption was utterly ridiculous and uninformed.
922980637186945024 2017-10-24 00:18:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kirkmin @jennifersterger @kyledowns1 @kenkenhall Wow.....seriously?  Ok, Captain Obtuse....I'm talking about what was horrible about your 'relevancy' take.
922948015924678658 2017-10-24 22:08:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kirkmin @jennifersterger @kyledowns1 @kenkenhall How about this....you're making a ridiculous and de-legitimizing assumption based on zero actual knowledge of what really happened to her.

922534465469079552 2017-10-23 18:45:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert Regardless, he isn't in the B club....
922534098861723648 2017-10-23 18:44:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckCarltonDMN I cannot believe this was a major topic point at the presser today. Come on....
922533760305909760 2017-10-23 18:42:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert I know this is more recent, but is he a part of Dodgers ownership now?
922533490691854336 2017-10-23 18:41:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert Well I know he had a group of businesses in LA that included movie theaters. Maybe it was just that...not 100% sure.
922533148113670145 2017-10-23 18:40:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 Add in (what has been for a while now) mediocre product, and you have the current situation....
922532085147029505 2017-10-23 18:36:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 The athletic dept doesn't really give two shits about the general student population, and hasn't for some time now.
922531366113349632 2017-10-23 18:33:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer @josephcook89 True, but the vast majority of current students haven't seen a football team with a winning record during their time on the 40
922530697658748929 2017-10-23 18:30:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert Ok, I thought maybe his business interests outside of basketball might have gotten him close.
922530183613214720 2017-10-23 18:28:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert Good point
922529760214994944 2017-10-23 18:26:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert Also, is Magic Johnson in the B-club?
922529582946881538 2017-10-23 18:26:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert Not soon with the money he will be making as part of Marlins ownership?

922498302729474048 2017-10-23 16:21:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps TV networks who understand that Texas and TCU will draw a bigger number than Oklahoma and Oklahoma State
922464225452265473 2017-10-23 14:06:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 No he didn't, Chris. Reid handles the business side of the team, not the baseball side. That's Jeff Lunhow.
922456774439067649 2017-10-23 13:36:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 They had a good one, but Mack drove him out. Bryan Harsin...
922309517731393537 2017-10-22 03:51:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PressSec Hmmm, how about because that isn't true?   Yup, that's it. It's not true.
922306751197835265 2017-10-22 03:40:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @Spicoli1981 The only "rule" the NFL has is...be on the field during the anthem, and the Pentagon paid for that. Nate isn't advocating breaking that rule
922280393696571393 2017-10-22 01:55:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden They miss Shanahan
922279324631355392 2017-10-22 01:51:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN He misses a lot of things....
922279203877326858 2017-10-22 01:51:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters My point was....say it right the first time.
922278710060908544 2017-10-22 01:49:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @uttailgaters I don't. I knew what you meant, but inaccurate statements like that drive me nuts. All you had to do was say it right the first time.
922277934618042370 2017-10-22 01:46:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @uttailgaters I knew what you meant. I just wanted you to actually say that, instead of the incorrect statement you made earlier.
922277570095263744 2017-10-22 01:44:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @uttailgaters See how easy that was?
922276886901862402 2017-10-22 01:41:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @uttailgaters I 100% understand the meaning of the word. You should try to be more accurate in your statements.
922274423574614016 2017-10-22 01:32:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @uttailgaters I'm not. You said it, not me.
922273701567098882 2017-10-22 01:29:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @uttailgaters The students are paying customers....
922269475025678336 2017-10-22 01:12:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @JetSweeps It's only that way if you donate to the Foundation. You can buy season tickets without that.
922267466935537665 2017-10-22 01:04:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @nfldraftscout You still may
922264361435049984 2017-10-22 00:52:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinAndrews I'm still a BIG fan of Moira Kelly
922260082796171264 2017-10-22 00:35:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN This comment is pretty short-sighted, Mike.
922258916398043137 2017-10-22 00:30:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinHogan Yeah, I mean really.....some people consider this a choice?? It's @Whataburger every day and twice on Sundays.

922227507620917249 2017-10-22 22:25:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde There have been a multitude of people trying to make this argument today, in pretty pitiful fashion.
922227352591065089 2017-10-22 22:25:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @lonestarball Um, ok.....pic.twitter.com/4mUxHhOh6t
922218390709833728 2017-10-22 21:49:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @almightyreptar Still wasn't a pass-first system. Dallas had a lot of not-good teams then, so they would be playing from behind.
922216873604911104 2017-10-22 21:43:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @almightyreptar You might want to go back and peruse his stats again. Also consider that he has never been a part of a spread-out, pass-first system.
922214880760999936 2017-10-22 21:35:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @almightyreptar And? Name an elite WR that Gronk played with. Name one that Gates played with.
922214276126867457 2017-10-22 21:33:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> People on Twitter now trying to sell that Jason Witten isn't a HOF-worthy TE. Simply laughable....
922212350245113859 2017-10-22 21:25:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @almightyreptar It does when you produce like he has
922211056302346240 2017-10-22 21:20:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @almightyreptar If by "piled up a lot of numbers" you mean that he's been remarkably consistent throughout his career? Ok....
922208556631445507 2017-10-22 21:10:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones In what respect?

922201264708096001 2017-10-22 20:41:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @CoreyElliot For current students (a small portion, anyway), the best season they've seen was Mack's last year.

922200650292875266 2017-10-22 20:39:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @CoreyElliot I agree, but I guess I'm more understanding as to the reasons why it is that way. Mainly, program mediocrity....
922196933124509696 2017-10-22 20:24:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @CoreyElliot Student tickets aren't free guys. Remember that....  Cheaper? Yes, but not free.

921857134102564864 2017-10-21 21:54:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn It doesn't help anything and on top of that, it's selfish.
921849518408323073 2017-10-21 21:23:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodbabers I don't see what the problem is....
921842341824090112 2017-10-21 20:55:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DayDay409 Sir, with all due respect, you need to stop. We all know what your motivation is, and it's selfish.
921820838466347008 2017-10-21 19:29:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin Yet he refuses to use it
921814979598340096 2017-10-21 19:06:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 They could tackle a  WR on a route and it would not get called.
921809861507256321 2017-10-21 18:46:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports Maryland is a shell of the team that came to Austin

921789810196574210 2017-10-21 17:26:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps I'm seeing it too. I would say 'unreal', but..... @Big12Refs

921787712444731393 2017-10-21 17:18:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot Never should have happened though. #FreshmanMistake
921785316482207745 2017-10-21 17:08:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr I actually think that benefitted Texas. They ran up and quickly ran another play.
921782109542469633 2017-10-21 16:55:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> I will keep preaching this....  Down by contact needs to be a thing is college football. Period.

921772398508113920 2017-10-21 16:17:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RickyDoyle @BobBallouSports @WWMcClyde Ok, I disagree that it has nothing to do with it.
921772082744217601 2017-10-21 16:16:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RickyDoyle @BobBallouSports I do think it's part of it, yes
921769463082639360 2017-10-21 16:05:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> Media members talking junk about UT student attendance at games from their nice press box view has grown tiresome.

921582052205572101 2017-10-20 03:40:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers Part of the reason he doesn't get much heat is that Dallas is bottom 3 in the league in terms of % of cap $ spent on defense.

920788196195295233 2017-10-18 23:06:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BamColt @WWMcClyde @ZaneMoneyEllis Yes....when they were looking for something else, because Tanaka has had them off-balance all game long.
920787744489705474 2017-10-18 23:04:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BamColt @WWMcClyde @ZaneMoneyEllis And Tanaka is one of their best, so....
920787276564717568 2017-10-18 23:02:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BamColt @WWMcClyde @ZaneMoneyEllis So do the pitchers
920782947548041216 2017-10-18 22:45:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NFL @realDonaldTrump Exactly like you.....all hat, no cattle.
920752823779946498 2017-10-18 20:45:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Sometimes it's the little things in life....
920739337813266432 2017-10-18 19:52:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RepWilson @PressSec @jaketapper @Aloe9678 Only I really don't think he did....
920734913023836161 2017-10-18 19:34:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RepWilson @PressSec @jaketapper Excuse, Mrs. Sanders, did he say that or didn't he? Simple question....  If he did, that's 100% on him, and he is getting what he deserves.
920711213620883457 2017-10-18 18:00:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson @clarencehilljr Again....I agree, but it has still been better than the previous regime.
920711038827466760 2017-10-18 17:59:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson @clarencehilljr I agree
920710915183595521 2017-10-18 17:59:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson @clarencehilljr More talented? Yes.... More experienced? No.
920710568704724994 2017-10-18 17:58:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson @clarencehilljr *wins
920710520348520448 2017-10-18 17:57:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson @clarencehilljr But you're correct that the ultimate sign of real progress is when
920710375045287936 2017-10-18 17:57:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson @clarencehilljr I disagree. I think it has been better just not as good as it probably should be. You also have to factor in multiple OL injuries
920707654082859011 2017-10-18 17:46:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson @clarencehilljr I agree. I was just giving the glass-is-half-full perspective.
920706778991661057 2017-10-18 17:42:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BillOReilly But would she sexually harass someone?
920706084066791424 2017-10-18 17:40:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr The positive side is, you can see how close they are. 2 or 3 plays away from being 5-1 right now. @AnwarRichardson
920705315108261892 2017-10-18 17:37:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS @BobBallouSports Hey, this is a social media world. I have every right to have my uneducated, uniformed, snap-judgement opinion heard and respected, dammit!!
920537238122967040 2017-10-17 06:29:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jeff_Caplan Yes, give him double rods and walk away
920511700964708354 2017-10-17 04:47:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @deray There was a documentary about him called "Salute". It came out in 2008. I highly recommend it.
920508031665885187 2017-10-17 04:33:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @Iamkeefer @jesetomson Ah, well....no thanks, I'm good.
920507228926377990 2017-10-17 04:30:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @Iamkeefer @jesetomson Pardon?
920498128050114560 2017-10-17 03:53:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay Also, it's still *It's*.
920497908499337218 2017-10-17 03:52:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay *You're  My mistake....let me rephrase....I hope Al did so of his own volition.
920497624976904192 2017-10-17 03:51:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay Where did I say that?
920497263381745666 2017-10-17 03:50:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay That doesn't mean his bosses made him do so. I'm sure Al did so of his own volition.
920496910473072641 2017-10-17 03:49:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay Be better
920495988212629506 2017-10-17 03:45:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GeorgeDunham @SeanCBass @ready1take1 It's a subtweet to a number of DFW media.....
920495795102765058 2017-10-17 03:44:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay See? Yes....  Make? No....
920495697534898176 2017-10-17 03:44:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay And you know that, do you?
920487035135242240 2017-10-17 03:09:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @Iamkeefer I never said it did
920474604619091970 2017-10-17 02:20:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @Iamkeefer Who said I was? Also, how long it's "been a thing" doesn't make the joke less wrong or unfunny.
920461332633280513 2017-10-17 01:27:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 If I had a Taco Bueno close to me? Destruction....

920450695681191936 2017-10-17 00:45:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 HA!
920450502155997184 2017-10-17 00:44:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JenksNBCS @ATXANT10 Agreed, and this is also why you are a prince among men, my friend.
920449979747061762 2017-10-17 00:42:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JenksNBCS Him having the platform he has, making the money he makes, insults me.
920449731393916929 2017-10-17 00:41:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> Tell a guy he's wrong for thinking Al Michael's joke on Sunday night wasn't funny....get blocked for it. Obtuse, insensitive snowflake....
920447901553315843 2017-10-17 00:34:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @Iamkeefer It made light of a very serious situation & issue affecting MANY women. It was a poor choice by Al, and that's why he rightly apologized.

920446673385648129 2017-10-17 00:29:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JenksNBCS OH JESUS!!!! I pray that is just broken bones and not a dislocation, because then you're probably looking at significant ligament damage.
920446030889607170 2017-10-17 00:26:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JenksNBCS ?
920445870746857473 2017-10-17 00:26:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay And grammar, yes....
920445720917872641 2017-10-17 00:25:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @247CowboysTalk You do know the difference between "bringing to light" and "making light of" don't you?
920445443145981952 2017-10-17 00:24:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay Consider yourself lucky. I hope no woman you know ever has to deal with it, but if it does happen, you'll understand better.
920445035006570497 2017-10-17 00:22:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay Al's joke made light of a VERY serious situation & issue affecting MANY women. I'm not mad at him, but he was wrong and correctly apologized
920444750142066688 2017-10-17 00:21:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @247CowboysTalk Let me help you then, since you're struggling....making that joke makes light of a very serious situation & issue affecting MANY women.
920443310229147649 2017-10-17 00:16:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @247CowboysTalk You think THAT is the reason why? Wow dude.....
920443007421251595 2017-10-17 00:14:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @Hillhuckman Very true. The media at the time went after him pretty hard.
920442829293391872 2017-10-17 00:14:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @247CowboysTalk Think about why it might not be for a little while and then get back to me, champ.
920442669721096192 2017-10-17 00:13:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay *It's*  And I'm going to guess you don't know a woman who's been sexually harassed, assaulted, or abused....
920440313566715905 2017-10-17 00:04:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @Iamkeefer It wasn't funny and he was correct to apologize.
920440155315625984 2017-10-17 00:03:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @lbcshay And that is part of the problem....
920440060117504001 2017-10-17 00:03:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @247CowboysTalk It really wasn't
920436626416984064 2017-10-17 23:49:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @Hillhuckman You have apparently forgotten the reaction to it then. People had a very strong negative reaction to that, and Howard lost his gig over it.

920376360689917954 2017-10-17 19:49:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Dealing with the city of Austin is what has made that more difficult.
920364525844619265 2017-10-17 19:02:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Agreed. I think remodeling/rebuilding Burger has always been the best idea, but working out that plan ain't easy.
920364253218996230 2017-10-17 19:01:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Not for what an MLS team would want/need. Basketball arena? Sure, but not a soccer stadium.
920362320525701121 2017-10-17 18:54:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott If they work out a deal w/ UT to play at Myers it could possibly work, OR work out a deal with AISD to tear down & rebuild the Burger Center
920300644145213441 2017-10-17 14:49:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @culvers @PaulPabst Culvers is decent, but it doesn't compare to the other ones that are being discussed.

920286196441460736 2017-10-17 13:51:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I would assume the deal is for Myers, not DKR

920113629269250049 2017-10-16 02:25:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SInow @mlowry1142 My guess is, CBS thought the NFL would pick up the slack and they just haven't.
920113468119945216 2017-10-16 02:25:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SInow @mlowry1142 I understand. I'm just saying that from things I've read, TV ratings are down in general, but the NFL is still at/near the top of them.
920108327757021184 2017-10-16 02:04:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SInow @mlowry1142 Take a closer look. Ratings are down across the board for all of television, mainly due to cord-cutting.

919803197044162561 2017-10-15 05:52:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MuslimIQ @sarahforpdx I agree
919785199071789057 2017-10-15 04:40:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @pointblaek And I'm sorry that you can't see the difference between what I actually did as oppose to what you want to believe I did.
919784916350656512 2017-10-15 04:39:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @pointblaek In no way did I defend him or what he said. You are wrong.
919783321370054657 2017-10-15 04:33:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @pointblaek I didn't defend the the commenter, either.
919783098849660928 2017-10-15 04:32:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @pointblaek I argued against inferring that Al Michaels somehow supports rape culture. I didn't say don't criticize.
919781012183404544 2017-10-15 04:24:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @pointblaek I still did no such thing in reference to the comment itself.
919780076467752960 2017-10-15 04:20:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @pointblaek How and where did I defend the comment?
919778469952851968 2017-10-15 04:14:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MuslimIQ @YoMikeBrown Nope, not funny at all....which is why it was bad, and why he apologized.
919776917502550016 2017-10-15 04:08:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MuslimIQ @YoMikeBrown You're correct. That's why it was bad and why he apologized.
919776489272430594 2017-10-15 04:06:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MuslimIQ This is exactly what I meant by that in my initial response. Sometimes a bad joke is just that, and only that.
919774206694428673 2017-10-15 03:57:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MuslimIQ He made a poor joke, then apologized. Don't make a mountain out of a mole hill.

919766730452488193 2017-10-15 03:27:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thebiglead Thankfully, he apologized.

919745634743279616 2017-10-15 02:03:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @thelonghorns12 They have a choice. 10-personnel makes the offense much tougher to defend.
919741000347783169 2017-10-15 01:45:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EZshop1 Really? Better than Tyron Smith & Joe Thomas? Ok, keep looking at it through those Crimson-colored glasses. His NFL career is irrelevant btw
919740215043948545 2017-10-15 01:42:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TrentW71 @EZshop1 My whole point is, Big 12 refs are awful at calling offensive holding, across the board, and OU has benefited greatly from this.
919739916837359617 2017-10-15 01:40:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TrentW71 @EZshop1 When he was at OU, yes. How much money he is currently making in the NFL is irrelevant to this.
919739658518581248 2017-10-15 01:39:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EZshop1 Also, he is not the consensus best LT in the NFL. Try again....
919739536351137793 2017-10-15 01:39:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EZshop1 Um, I'm not the one who started a thread bitching about officiating after a win, and yes....Trent Williams was a holding machine at OU.

919738151152836608 2017-10-15 01:33:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EZshop1 Go back and watch Trent Williams' entire OU career, then start cooking your shoes to make them palatable for consumption.
919737867580166144 2017-10-15 01:32:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Gabe_TFB I don't live & die by metrics though I understand their value. I've seen 3 OU games, 2 OSU games. IMO, OU's D is better, especially up front
919736360399003648 2017-10-15 01:26:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> As are you when it comes whining about officiating after a win, as well as how to not use proper English.....
919735737649680385 2017-10-15 01:24:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Gabe_TFB Competition adjusted?
919735431809437696 2017-10-15 01:23:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @thelonghorns12 He is a serviceable blocker and probably the best all-around TE we have, although Brewer is getting there.
919735048911417344 2017-10-15 01:21:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @thelonghorns12 And yet our coaching staff insists on sticking with primarily 11-personnel.....smdh.
919734811534725120 2017-10-15 01:20:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Gabe_TFB Offensively, yes....though their OL isn't as good as OU, but OU's defense is definitely better.
919734600603234305 2017-10-15 01:19:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> I can find and present the evidence, but I really don't have the energy or desire to dig it up right now. #SorryNotSorry
919733485169934336 2017-10-15 01:15:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @thelonghorns12 or at least average with Rodriguez & Williams....
919732836432740352 2017-10-15 01:12:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @MBHORNSFAN Injuries, attrition (silly, in some cases), and Wickline.
919732285808828417 2017-10-15 01:10:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Agreed. OU's defense is unquestionably better.
919732124613308416 2017-10-15 01:10:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GENOALLDAY7 @CoachG14 @lisajean1922 I will save you (and me) the time of going back over the last (almost) 2 decades by saying that the evidence is STRONGLY on my side on this.
919730976808423424 2017-10-15 01:05:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Which they usually do, but you're right....OU's OL is better.
919730348539498497 2017-10-15 01:02:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Gabe_TFB I disagree. OSU is close, but not better overall.
919730225197604865 2017-10-15 01:02:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Oklahoma has better overall skill position talent, IMO, and is as (if not more) efficient on offense. OU has them on D though....
919729876441198594 2017-10-15 01:01:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachG14 @lisajean1922 Both in the TX/OU game and overall in Big 12 play......
919729758061121537 2017-10-15 01:00:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachG14 @lisajean1922 1) Big 12 refs are probably the worst in the CFB at calling offensive holding.  2) OU made a LIVING off of this during the Bob Stoops era.
919728783124566016 2017-10-15 00:56:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lisajean1922 Yup, Texas lost. Texas fans aren't the ones bitching about the officiating though.....
919728434116513792 2017-10-15 00:55:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachG14 @lisajean1922 Agree to disagree
919728367800373248 2017-10-15 00:55:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachG14 @lisajean1922 You're right, Texas lost.....so why on Earth are you people bitching about the officiating after a win?
919725994801496064 2017-10-15 00:45:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachG14 @lisajean1922 If standard coverage is pushing him to the sideline, then yes, but it is still a forceout.
919725499915689984 2017-10-15 00:43:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> Most of this OU fan's thread is him griping about holds that weren't called. This may be peak irony in terms of CFB fans griping about refs.https://twitter.com/JohnTolomeo24/status/919640825008705537

918225119008485388 2017-10-11 21:21:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @BRudd23 @JustinBartels2 or do both until real change occurs.....
918224721094856705 2017-10-11 21:20:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @BRudd23 @JustinBartels2 Many of them already do these things, and yes, protesting does do something....it brings attention to the issue & creates discussion.
918224259364806658 2017-10-11 21:18:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @BRudd23 @JustinBartels2 Not from Kaep it wasn't. Again, a major issue here is the flag/anthem people have blinders on and aren't listening.
918223411129802752 2017-10-11 21:14:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @BRudd23 @JustinBartels2 So, doing it in a way that's "acceptable" to everyone kind of defeats the purpose.
918223113514573824 2017-10-11 21:13:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @BRudd23 @JustinBartels2 People (especially white people) keep saying that, yet offer no alternatives. Also, the point of a protest is to get attention for an issue.
918222355662540800 2017-10-11 21:10:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @BRudd23 @JustinBartels2 I disagree that the message was lost long before Trump. Also, people's over-focus on the method is a big reason why the cause exists.
918221943698067456 2017-10-11 21:09:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @BRudd23 @JustinBartels2 Unfortunately, many people do think it's ok.
918214885212815360 2017-10-11 20:41:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @JustinBartels2 @BRudd23 I am kind of in that field. I currently do some part-time online broadcasting for @kmacsports as well as some podcasting on the side.

918209054287323137 2017-10-11 20:17:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @JustinBartels2 @BRudd23 I have found it ridiculous that people are more upset about the manner of protest than what the protest is about. However.....
918208311945723905 2017-10-11 20:14:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @JustinBartels2 @BRudd23 Agreed
918207311298093057 2017-10-11 20:10:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @JustinBartels2 @BRudd23 Not at all ok, but the league & its players would have been better served by not taking the bait. However, I understand their reaction.

918193499345956864 2017-10-11 19:16:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @BRudd23 @JustinBartels2 Actually, yes you can. Now, it doesn't free you from consequences for those actions but you still can do it
918190105667555328 2017-10-11 19:02:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS @BRudd23 @JustinBartels2 They don't, plus they have a CBA w/ the union but regardless, your 1st amendment rights are not taken from you just because you are at work.
918185479266332672 2017-10-11 18:44:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MikeLeslieWFAA Why did you think this needed to be tweeted out?

918149519249985536 2017-10-11 16:21:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @toddarcher It didn't take an NFL scout to know the Nolan Carroll signing was bad. I knew it was when it happened.
917991130150719490 2017-10-10 05:51:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWetzel @SoccerByIves Soccer fans need to realize that the US will never be anything close to a power in the sport until our best athletes start playing it.

917874959736766464 2017-10-10 22:10:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Yeah.....that ain't quite gon' cut it.

917819434739425282 2017-10-10 18:29:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @kylewatson1984 @StuartWoodal Well, it's that specific language which is the key here.

917814771478446080 2017-10-10 18:11:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @StuartWoodal So the only way to make the intentions of their protest clear is by not protesting?

917799530917179392 2017-10-10 17:10:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @StuartWoodal Yes, by saying so. How else do you expect them to make that clear distinction?

917794164993069056 2017-10-10 16:49:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @StuartWoodal They have made it abundantly clear that they are not protesting the flag or the anthem
917793435410722816 2017-10-10 16:46:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @KS4OSU @garrygunn That doesn't apply here

917758259976695809 2017-10-10 14:26:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @StuartWoodal I think a lot of people believe they are actually protesting the flag/anthem.
917757772611059712 2017-10-10 14:24:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarackObama @HiMyNameIsSeton @Dutchistheballs Except he didn't, but ok....
917747831636725768 2017-10-10 13:45:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dmn_cowboys @khairopoulos Except he's wrong, of course....

917745156010409985 2017-10-10 13:34:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg Our tax dollars didn't pay for the players' protest. They did pay for Pence's stunt.
917742639239389190 2017-10-10 13:24:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman @dean_fultz Sticking up for someone's right to express their own opinions is now a "leftist" view? Hmm, ok.....
917741915034046464 2017-10-10 13:21:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dpshow @HiMyNameIsSeton @Dutchistheballs Stick to whatever it is you do for a living and stop telling people what they can and can't say on their own page.
917741063728697347 2017-10-10 13:18:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Dutchistheballs @HiMyNameIsSeton The answer to your question is yes. It is an abuse of power.
917739366281248769 2017-10-10 13:11:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 @StuartWoodal I think "most" is a stretch
917652332116103168 2017-10-10 07:25:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @E_Dot817 @KS4OSU The topic I addressed was one guy (of many) who wanted to compare his job to that of an NFL player as if they are the same w/ the same rules
917650740335824896 2017-10-10 07:19:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateBoyer37 The flag/anthem is the vehicle for, not the object of, the protest. People need to understand this....
917650401180225536 2017-10-10 07:17:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SenBobCorker @rex_rexchapman LOL.....doesn't have quite the same ring to it, but I see you.
917645760941961216 2017-10-09 06:59:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PrevailandRide Or not.....
917645649822314496 2017-10-09 06:59:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NRA @GregAbbott_TX So, because something hasn't happened yet, it poses no danger and has no dire consequences? Are you high or just obscenely obtuse?
917644364309987328 2017-10-09 06:54:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @E_Dot817 @KS4OSU Actually, that is what a lot of people in this thread were saying.
917620043462205441 2017-10-09 05:17:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @E_Dot817 @KS4OSU I said that players have CBA & contracts, therefore an owner can't just do whatever he feels like.

917594579678920704 2017-10-09 03:36:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports @DMcComasOB @ATXANT10 Ok, been seeing this referenced all day. What did Bob say to crack up Herman so much?
917593511624609797 2017-10-09 03:31:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @E_Dot817 @DerekMaberry That taxpayer-funded stunt Pence pulled on Sunday was infuriating.
917593208980430848 2017-10-09 03:30:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @E_Dot817 @DerekMaberry Precisely....Trump blew up this issue as a distraction, and unfortunately, it worked.
917592317703442432 2017-10-09 03:27:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @DerekMaberry @E_Dot817 Another beauty of our country... If people disagree with a method of non-violent protest, Fine, but calling for someone's firing for it? No.
917591192254271494 2017-10-09 03:22:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @E_Dot817 Well, that decision and how "their time" is defined isn't up to you and I. That is one of the beauties of our country

917589289214644224 2017-10-09 03:15:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @E_Dot817 @Evan_P_Grant I have seen that passage posted by NFL media folks in recent weeks. It was a put in when the Defense Dept began paying the NFL.
917588930228379648 2017-10-09 03:13:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @E_Dot817 Please note that is says "should", not "must" or "will". There is no league requirement for them to stand.

917587128447590400 2017-10-09 03:06:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @E_Dot817 I'm saying unless your job has a CBA w/ you & your co-workers & a contract that you agreed to, their job has completely different rules.
917585960610816000 2017-10-09 03:01:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @hodgman Well, for a lot of them it was about Donald Trump.
917585618191966208 2017-10-09 03:00:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @KS4OSU Not every employer....especially ones whose organization has a CBA with its employees, and whose employees have contracts.
917585056553684992 2017-10-09 02:58:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @E_Dot817 Your job is NOT their job. Stop comparing them.
917583914012684288 2017-10-09 02:53:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JennyVrentas Actually, he doesn't. There is no rule that says players must stand.
917555792693297153 2017-10-09 01:02:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mortreport @TonyDungy @JasonOsage It is amazing how many people don't understand that the NFL has a CBS and the players have contracts.

917553036712693761 2017-10-09 00:51:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mortreport @TonyDungy @dynasty8314 * A collective bargaining agreement
917552822522015744 2017-10-09 00:50:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones If I am correct, the game ops policy only states that players have to be on the field. It doesn't say they have to stand.
917551858373275649 2017-10-09 00:46:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mortreport @TonyDungy @dynasty8314 They have a collective bargaining, so that's not exactly true.

917516807736516608 2017-10-09 22:27:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Such respect for the flag being shown here....
917512470050365440 2017-10-09 22:09:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @espn @TonyBrunoShow They don't like continual bad news, which is what ESPN has had for the better part of a year or two.
917504715126202368 2017-10-09 21:39:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @espn @TonyBrunoShow Jemele Hill is neither the reason for its decline, nor the catalyst that will stop it.
917502545945341952 2017-10-09 21:30:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @espn @TonyBrunoShow Then why did you say "This was reason 101" why they had to?
917499265710161921 2017-10-09 21:17:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @espn @TonyBrunoShow You think Jemele Hill caused that? Lol....

917498180249509888 2017-10-09 21:13:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richarddeitsch @Tellall2012 @TonyBrunoShow This is very true, regardless of what people think of it.

917479839489232896 2017-10-09 20:00:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @CleanupHitter1 @RealGuyMitchell How so? And as a follow-up, what is the character of a "Real American"?

917479119763525632 2017-10-09 19:57:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @CleanupHitter1 @RealGuyMitchell @USCocksman Probably, but just in case, I decided to have a little fun, because I'm bored.
917478817618386944 2017-10-09 19:56:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealGuyMitchell No, I don't....that's why I asked, on both counts.
917478397617549312 2017-10-09 19:54:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @RealGuyMitchell @JimMartinezSA A fist raised for the cause.....progress!

917477463550283777 2017-10-09 19:50:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealGuyMitchell How? Feel free to quote every word I typed in your attempt to prove this charge.... *hint* - You can't, because I didn't.
917476175378829312 2017-10-09 19:45:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @RealGuyMitchell Um, I did no such thing.
917475050244247552 2017-10-09 19:41:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @RealGuyMitchell I didn't say anything about her. I remarked that it's unfortunate for her that your views are they way they are. There is a difference.
917471279678140417 2017-10-09 19:26:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Seem like no one followed up with the question of "What do you mean by disrespect?", which means they didn't do their jobs correctly.

917461276221112320 2017-10-09 18:46:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @RealGuyMitchell You are correct. One is far worse than the other....it's just too bad (especially for your daughter) that you are mixed up on which is which
917460767879901184 2017-10-09 18:44:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @swollenNuts @Nick_Dauphin @RealGuyMitchell So, just so we're clear....you think a man kneeling for the National Anthem is worse than if that same man beat up your daughter?

917442869140643840 2017-10-09 17:33:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA And we get to criticize him for the nonsensical lines he draws.....

917410050444025861 2017-10-09 15:22:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS @mikefinger @ATXANT10 I want Jerry to define disrespect
917369768822345728 2017-10-09 12:42:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Breaking911 @gordonkeith Depends on your level of sensitivity, I guess....
917254197304791040 2017-10-08 05:03:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BillSimmons @cbusrick Neither am I....good people don't propose the things he has proposed legislatively.
917252742577643520 2017-10-08 04:57:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BillSimmons @cbusrick No, he really isn't. He puts on the "nice guy" face/act, but the things he's done/tried to do as a legislator are those of a horrible person
917217867296399360 2017-10-08 02:39:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch You know why, don't you? Not defending it (it was terrible), but there is a reason.....

917200180608454656 2017-10-08 01:28:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster Correct
917196958292496384 2017-10-08 01:16:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @VP Are you really this obtuse or are you just trolling? It's hard to tell....
917195528223514625 2017-10-08 01:10:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster Yup....bottom 3 in the league in cap % spending on defense

917193284417736706 2017-10-08 01:01:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Still waiting on Jerry to define "disrespect", because I think Jerry is full of it. If Dak & Zeke decided to kneel, he would do NOTHING.
917180212072337408 2017-10-08 00:09:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Ask him to define that
917179532767105024 2017-10-08 00:06:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade I could be wrong, but that second downplay it look like a RPO, and Dak chose to pull the ball out and throw it.
917178018522681344 2017-10-08 00:00:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> Dallas is in a position where they need their offense to play near-perfect to perfect to win ball games against good teams. Not realistic...
917177325262901248 2017-10-08 23:58:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets That play looked like a Dak decision. It looked like a RPO.
917172381705220096 2017-10-08 23:38:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @dallascowboys will struggle to be an elite team until they decide to put more resources towards defense. Bottom 5 in the NFL in Def $
917155250255155200 2017-10-08 22:30:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade The run defense without Sean Lee is just so terrible
917155101982232576 2017-10-08 22:29:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers Still a bad call. Each team has one now.
917144602267803655 2017-10-08 21:48:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade Let me see it this week, and I'll catch you next weekend when I'm up in the Dub.

916831466457313281 2017-10-07 01:03:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @druceleroy Right now, I'm just praying that the stupid decision to not kick the FG in the 1Q doesn't bite them in the ass.
916830858211885056 2017-10-07 01:01:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @rodofdisaster There are good, aggressive chances and there are bad, stupid chances.

916827556434804736 2017-10-07 00:48:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I will NEVER be happy with giving away points due to stupid decision-making by the coaches.

916820042855211008 2017-10-07 00:18:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Mistake by Locke....if he plays the man, it's 3rd & goal.
916819869970108417 2017-10-07 00:17:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Especially when they just let him run free....
916817401215422464 2017-10-07 00:07:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny The binder needs to go in the trash is that is what caused them to not kick the FG earlier.

916813044843458560 2017-10-07 23:50:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher Having Porter in the game on 3rd down was a terrible call.
916812823283593217 2017-10-07 23:49:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> HORRIBLE coaching decision to not kick the FG there @CoachTomHerman
916812579468652551 2017-10-07 23:48:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher Blame Herman. He should have told them to kick

916447791001624577 2017-10-06 23:39:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin @bford782 Hey Blake....no one is putting a gun to your head and making you follow him. His account....his rules. Deal with it or unfollow.
916422771554562048 2017-10-06 21:59:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USATODAY @towershots I guess he hasn't considered the fact that him being a major asshole might be what's preventing him from finding work....
916421398997995520 2017-10-06 21:54:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 Blame @aclfestival....they TOLD people to use fanny packs this weekend
916392693676331008 2017-10-06 20:00:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Bit idea....  SG w/ "Connery" as a special guest
916151048485593088 2017-10-05 04:00:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 I disagree
916149655687360512 2017-10-05 03:54:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Neither is one-dimensional, however, one is a better passer and one is a better runner.
916148054130089984 2017-10-05 03:48:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Again, that's scheme....and yes, Beck didn't adjust to their new look AT ALL.
916147868888715264 2017-10-05 03:47:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 They were only doing that in obvious pass situations, after they stoned our run game
916147592358178816 2017-10-05 03:46:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Also, I would have had more RPO's and quick hitters
916147501127950338 2017-10-05 03:46:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 You're talking about pass plays where he would scramble.
916146961119629312 2017-10-05 03:43:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Well, I wouldn't have called over 60% run plays, 1st off.
916146603353927681 2017-10-05 03:42:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DerekDuke25 Makes no sense....
916146535624335360 2017-10-05 03:42:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 You're right, it isn't, but if he's still a D1 OC. If he can't develop a cohesive (at least somewhat) game plan to match his personnel? Bye.
916145721316913152 2017-10-05 03:38:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 If it's really tough for him, then he needs to not be here.
916144916081860608 2017-10-05 03:35:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 And Beck played right into their hands. There were also execution/injury issues, but still....

916144383539466240 2017-10-05 03:33:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DerekDuke25 You need to go to @BarkingCarnival and check out the Sean Connery thing.....like right now.

916144075723673600 2017-10-05 03:32:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 What they rolled out with against USC would have had more success with Shane as QB. Conversely, the ISU plan would have been better with Sam
916143716951379974 2017-10-05 03:30:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RyanBridgesCFB @thelonghorns12 @DerekDuke25 Nothing at all....
916143267569336321 2017-10-05 03:29:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RyanBridgesCFB @thelonghorns12 @DerekDuke25 Yes and no.
916143169355608065 2017-10-05 03:28:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RyanBridgesCFB @thelonghorns12 @DerekDuke25 The 1st thing that needs to happen is having a game plan designed for the QB that's actually playing.
916141944832757761 2017-10-05 03:23:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RyanBridgesCFB @thelonghorns12 @DerekDuke25 From that spot on the field, though, he probably should have taken off.
916141791581298690 2017-10-05 03:23:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Someone either screwed up or that is TERRIBLE route design.
916141288029814784 2017-10-05 03:21:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Very entertaining....talks over Nantz a little too much & goes a little long with his comments sometimes, but that will improve.
916140700009410560 2017-10-05 03:18:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Check that, I was wrong. That was in their end. Yes, see if you can get into FG range.
916140521092993025 2017-10-05 03:18:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 What does that get you on 3rd & 9 from inside your own 40? A big hit and a punt.....
916139945571635200 2017-10-05 03:15:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 By the time a WR turns to look to block there, the defenders will already have run past them. Again, they're inviting him to run.
916139552150118402 2017-10-05 03:14:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @KnowTheGame60 @KevinDunn01 @JetSweeps @WWMcClyde It's just glorious.....
916139411674365954 2017-10-05 03:13:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 If he takes off there, they close on him way before he gets the 1st down.
916139328522375168 2017-10-05 03:13:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Look again. The 5 underneath guys, in an umbrella zone, are all looking at Buechele's eyes to see where he is going to throw or if he runs.
916138819879043073 2017-10-05 03:11:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @MBHORNSFAN On 3rd & 9?
916138713108897792 2017-10-05 03:11:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RyanBridgesCFB I hope that was a mental error by one of the WRs
916138476512403457 2017-10-05 03:10:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 That was 3rd & 9, though....they're inviting him to run. @RyanBridgesCFB

914862311604674561 2017-10-02 14:39:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 I prefer not having to get up at the ass-crack of dawn to go to the Fairgrounds, hehehe....

914630552984186883 2017-10-01 23:18:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @jeffchaley I will agree that karaoke should not be run/done my amatuers.
914621606592499713 2017-10-01 22:42:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy ok, no karaoke when you come to Austin now. Thank you.....
914621521347440643 2017-10-01 22:42:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Gracias
914621230543724546 2017-10-01 22:41:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I get the strong sense this thread is more entertaining than the movie
914619709445812224 2017-10-01 22:35:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BillSimmons This is great. @billsimmons is still at his best when he's writing.  https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2017/9/29/16387550/donald-trump-protest-nfl-nba-colin-kaepernick-week-4-nfl-picks?utm_campaign=theringer&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter via @ringer
914606183012544512 2017-10-01 21:41:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PaulPabst He's been predicting so much stuff, someone might be listening.....
914599613323202560 2017-10-01 21:15:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattsarz Technically, this year's game is still on the 2nd weekend of October, as it is pretty much every year.
914597878835830785 2017-10-01 21:08:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreatDonovan @NormsClubhouse The long KO return & the fumbled punt were the turning point in the game, IMO.
914590627651780608 2017-10-01 20:39:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattsarz @uttailgaters @MBHORNSFAN 3:30 ET is the best for this game. A night game will never happen.
914590183256883200 2017-10-01 20:37:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs Completely unnecessary in the NFL
914588611210874887 2017-10-01 20:31:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving @lnish1438 The Rams defended it much better....
914588359976202242 2017-10-01 20:30:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving It's on everybody except maybe Elliot and Bailey.
914581746636730370 2017-10-01 20:04:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs They are missing him BADLY today, though....
914580770056015877 2017-10-01 20:00:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr It got tipped in front of him, but he still has to catch that.
914578889908920320 2017-10-01 19:52:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets I think this game would be totally different if not for the 2 special teams screw-ups
914578577563308032 2017-10-01 19:51:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs Drops, missed blocks, and missed throws = bad offense
914577605403213824 2017-10-01 19:47:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade He HAD Dez on 2nd down and just flat-out missed him.
914575594641346561 2017-10-01 19:39:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> Those 2 special teams screw-ups in the 1st half kept the Rams in this game. If not for those, we may have had a Dallas blowout, but.....
914574296051265538 2017-10-01 19:34:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving This simply isn't a good defense, plus they're missing their best player today.
914573916227633152 2017-10-01 19:33:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr I love those....
914572411911180289 2017-10-01 19:27:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr As was Witten's missed block the play before....
914572291706671104 2017-10-01 19:26:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Oh, Sean Lee.....how we miss thee.
914570996744671232 2017-10-01 19:21:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs And Jeff Heat is really bad.....really bad.
914570904948105217 2017-10-01 19:21:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade He is just terrible. I can't believe the Cowboys staff was good with him being a starter.
914570775109267458 2017-10-01 19:20:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StewMyrick He's terrible....
914559591060557825 2017-10-01 18:36:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @dallascowboys defense was WAY too passive on that drive to end the half.
914557792106803201 2017-10-01 18:29:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Hopkins.....just terribly underthrown due to poor footwork.
914557288886784000 2017-10-01 18:27:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA Two weeks in a row that Butler has made a GREAT adjustment when he saw his QB in trouble....
914556999832043520 2017-10-01 18:25:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist I loved how Witten ran up to Butler, grabbed his head, and told him to stop celebrating when it was initially ruled incomplete.
914551968257003520 2017-10-01 18:05:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Fucking rookie.....

914548630287212545 2017-10-01 17:52:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr McFadden would have scored on that. Just sayin'.....
914548523613507586 2017-10-01 17:52:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade Never had a step.....
914545751358832640 2017-10-01 17:41:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade That was just a simple check-down into the flat
914543003443884032 2017-10-01 17:30:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ringer @rodger_sherman Counter-take: College should adopt the NFL rule.
914541672830259207 2017-10-01 17:25:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @micahpeters_ To be fair, I don't think Kaep would make them any better. Their problems on offense go beyond Cutler.
914540686514548736 2017-10-01 17:21:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo Go all blue & white or go back to the other helmet
914536983724216320 2017-10-01 17:06:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> The Rams just need to go all blue & white with their uniforms.

914511971994750977 2017-10-01 15:26:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I think it was all a negative bent. Seemed like he was saying it was awful all around.
914511271835373570 2017-10-01 15:24:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Yeah....glad he clarified that pretty fast.
914497541047308288 2017-10-01 14:29:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I thought the same thing....poor throw.
914388789367361536 2017-10-01 07:17:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Lin_Manuel Don't let his darkness dim your light. Keep that uber-compassionate spirit high. Trump is flaming, human garbage. Let him burn.....

913652902593404928 2017-09-28 06:33:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 I am just befuddled that the gameplans seem to be made for the personnel they WISH they had, instead of the personnel the ACTUALLY have.

913633606743900161 2017-09-28 05:16:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 @TheDozens1 Yeah.....agreed. I, for one, would be SHOCKED if that turned out to be the case.

913618537725313024 2017-09-28 04:16:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 No RB is going to produce when there are no holes to run through.
913618382200520704 2017-09-28 04:16:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinHogan @Doc_Texas I don't have as problem with that as much as the fact that they played this game in a 15-yard box.
913618028553572352 2017-09-28 04:14:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Porter's numbers were much worse before that final possession. This is about the OL more than the RBs.
913616584068833280 2017-09-28 04:09:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinHogan My biggest issue w/ Beck & Herman is the offensive game-plan & play-calling doesn't seem to take into account the actual personnel they have
913616090369896454 2017-09-28 04:07:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinHogan However, Beck wasn't trying to attack this weak secondary down the field until it was obvious, given down & distance.
913615620641456129 2017-09-28 04:05:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @Bitterwhiteguy I actually thought Kerstetter was pretty solid tonight. Rough 3Q, but overall? Good....
913612599262011393 2017-09-28 03:53:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Rough 3Q, but an overall solid effort
913612096805388288 2017-09-28 03:51:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Which QB plays won't matter until Beck & Herman discover how to gameplan & call plays for the personnel the HAVE not who they WISH they had
913611628062449665 2017-09-28 03:49:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster I didn't see any of it after the 1st drive. Just incredible.....  Btw, you wouldn't pull Nickelson. He would be the guy to block down.
913610735950766080 2017-09-28 03:45:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster Even on run plays.....just awful

913609882867085313 2017-09-28 03:42:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster Nickelson is just awful
913609819847778304 2017-09-28 03:42:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster He did. He had a rough 3Q, but overall....solid effort. I'll make a more accurate judgement when I re-watch
913609639081607168 2017-09-28 03:41:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @srr50 This is still on Beck & Herman. They are calling plays like they don't know what their personnel actually is.
913608886157942784 2017-09-28 03:38:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster That had nothing to do with anything.
913608834437935104 2017-09-28 03:38:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @srr50 What I've seen from Sam. I think he would have taken off and tried to run there.
913608670117715969 2017-09-28 03:37:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster He wasn't trying to hurdle the defender. He jumped to try and flip the ball to Foreman, because the DE got into his chest.
913608501296906240 2017-09-28 03:36:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @srr50 That TD throw to Carter was a play Sam doesn't make
913608386620436480 2017-09-28 03:36:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster (2/2) getting DESTROYED (like he did almost all game) on the play. Should he have just eaten it? Sure, but the play was killed by Nickelson.
913608142411382786 2017-09-28 03:35:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster That screen at the end of the half took too long. He caught it with 4 seconds left. The fumble on the reverse was caused by Nickelson (1/2)
913607671005143041 2017-09-28 03:33:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster Now you need to stop.
913606856433582080 2017-09-28 03:30:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> But at least it was a big, tasty one.....
913606769422696449 2017-09-28 03:30:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodofdisaster That last drive was good, and they actually executed, so it worked. The res of the game after the 1st drive? Not so much....
913604612468256769 2017-09-28 03:21:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> Ok, tip your cap to him for the QB draw call....I did.
913603912816508930 2017-09-28 03:18:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving He needs what happened to Elliot earlier.....
913603286057467904 2017-09-28 03:16:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> All of this.....
913602133705891840 2017-09-28 03:11:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps He couldn't block me.....
913601286611677185 2017-09-28 03:08:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps 2nd down on that series was ALL on Shane. I have no earthly idea what he was thinking, keeping that ball.
913595657922912256 2017-09-28 02:45:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Why? This has nothing to do with Shane.....
913590493606436864 2017-09-28 02:25:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Breckyn44 @justinwells2424 Oh come on.....no Thor .gif?
913585480242839552 2017-09-28 02:05:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps false start, then a bad play call that lost 2 yards.....dead possession.
913585078223069184 2017-09-28 02:03:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch He was.....once. He dropped it.
913584932181512192 2017-09-28 02:03:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 These officials have been awful at it all game long.
913578772296646656 2017-09-28 01:38:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn He is getting OWNED by the only decent D-Lineman they have.
913577407520452608 2017-09-28 01:33:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy They're nothing, if not consistent.....
913577267548250113 2017-09-28 01:32:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde So did @craigway1
913576975863709696 2017-09-28 01:31:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS From their own two? Really?
913575316236283904 2017-09-28 01:25:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 Very gingerly.... #ManRegion
913575177232957440 2017-09-28 01:24:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 He got hit in the junk
913573193595498497 2017-09-28 01:16:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DebraMessing I can't wait to watch this episode later.....
913572552705896448 2017-09-28 01:14:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps Hence the late hit
913572029780992000 2017-09-28 01:11:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Target @CoreyElliot I don't think it was targeting
913571800499462144 2017-09-28 01:11:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps I don't think that was targeting, because of the target change
913571308859834370 2017-09-28 01:09:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> You should have to be down by contact in college football
913565332052127744 2017-09-28 00:45:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps Well, we gave the award to Beck after USC
913563936036814849 2017-09-28 00:39:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps Would not shock me.... #GoldenDildoAwardWinner
913563127916064768 2017-09-28 00:36:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps Warren should have just eaten the ball. Nickleson got DESTROYED on that play.

913546959763292161 2017-09-28 23:32:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tperkins Keep telling yourself that, big guy.....
913545401344471041 2017-09-28 23:26:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @corbydavidson @P1_Daja @cyclonereport This is true. I forgot he retired in January, lol.....now we all look dumb.
913545045868896256 2017-09-28 23:24:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @corbydavidson @P1_Daja Who is? Greg?
913544328399659008 2017-09-28 23:21:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @hasanthehun They didn't elect him yet. He just won a GOP primary run-off.
913544170488324097 2017-09-28 23:21:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN That score would give me sports wood.....
913543863192608768 2017-09-28 23:20:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @P1_Daja @corbydavidson Yes, Greg Davis is Iowa's OC......but Texas is playing Iowa State.

913221008919810048 2017-09-27 01:57:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CJNitkowski Personally, I agree....however, I don't believe our current leadership views it that way.

912845186513989632 2017-09-26 01:03:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Alyssa_Milano @th3k0w81 I understand that, but when you do something like that with no real grounds for it, it looks pointless.
912842482349740037 2017-09-26 00:53:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Alyssa_Milano Bad idea....right now there are no grounds for it.
912840061879799809 2017-09-26 00:43:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones They are, without question, that easy.

912759407393550336 2017-09-26 19:22:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @DaWall311 Yeah.....that's it. 
912747833069010946 2017-09-26 18:36:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF Lol, not surprising....

912738172249022465 2017-09-26 17:58:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @johnuj6238 Scholarships, at a minimum, should equal full cost of attendance, which varies school to school.
912735218389458945 2017-09-26 17:46:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @johnuj6238 So, I assume you think someone on a full academic scholarship shouldn't be able to get paid/make money either then?
912733701255122949 2017-09-26 17:40:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HelmetBoy_Texas Texas & Florida are doing great? Really?  Hmm.....

912730639501332483 2017-09-26 17:28:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thereallisaann That is heart-breaking and empowering all at once. I am very sorry that you have had your family treat you that way. It hurts my heart.
912722634810388483 2017-09-26 16:56:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> I agree, but it won't be any time soon, IMO.
912719651485839360 2017-09-26 16:44:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> Not to be too cynical, but this vote will be little more than symbolic.

912704360097951745 2017-09-26 15:44:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Basketball might be the dirtiest of them all, although the competition is fierce....

912664994768195584 2017-09-26 13:07:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall The full 3+ minute video is glorious

912543616144429066 2017-09-25 05:05:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving @SheainIrvingPod @therealjonchris This is very true. It also helps that the team never trailed by more than 7 tonight. Denver game was completely different circumstances.
912540253130510336 2017-09-25 04:52:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman I retweeted the full 3+ minute rant from Dale Hansen. It's good stuff....

912538007475036160 2017-09-25 04:43:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @birdbrained @miguelevision I was not aware of that. I just thought it was a cool thing to do, especially in your rival's stadium, for one of their fans.
912537016050610176 2017-09-25 04:39:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF It is up for debate, but that was really eff-ing cool.

912534637968330752 2017-09-25 04:29:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> After hearing Jason & Jerry explain what went into the @dallascowboys decision for their pregame action, I don't see how you could be mad.

912020433230336001 2017-09-24 18:26:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DME123456789 How do you know what side of the issue he is on? Has he spoken about it publicly? If he has, I would love a link to those comments.
912020179361701889 2017-09-24 18:25:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DME123456789 Yes, I am well aware of that, which is why I fully support it.
912017584257732609 2017-09-24 18:15:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @nightnurse38 @JDBlack26 I am fully aware as to what these protests are about, which is why I'm on board with them.
912017410064097281 2017-09-24 18:14:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones I would lean towards Tomlin knowing as well, but I will be very curious to find out for sure.
912015135123951618 2017-09-24 18:05:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @nightnurse38 @JDBlack26 So, when you know the thoughts on a subject of people you know, you never ever use it in discussion?
912013821102915585 2017-09-24 18:00:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn @jeffchaley This is true....
912013733844733952 2017-09-24 17:59:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mitchellvii I can think of a list of things....
912012484902604801 2017-09-24 17:54:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @nightnurse38 @JDBlack26 I never said every vet was. Note I said every one that I KNOW. I was speaking from personal experience & relationships, not for every vet.
912011697245835264 2017-09-24 17:51:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones I wish I could say I was surprised by this, but sadly.....
912011344697856000 2017-09-24 17:50:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn I like some of those too, hehehe....
912010960797388801 2017-09-24 17:48:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @premierleague @STL_Blonde You're in for a rude awakening, then, lol.....
912010691833409536 2017-09-24 17:47:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @nightnurse38 @JDBlack26 ok.....I don't know you, now do I?
912010543229292549 2017-09-24 17:47:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Mine would be more of the scotch/single barrel variety
912009356933308416 2017-09-24 17:42:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn I want to go to there.....
912006846491299840 2017-09-24 17:32:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @JDBlack26 @nightnurse38 ....(2/2) they understand/agree with the reasons other people choose to protest during the anthem by kneeling.
912006610515578881 2017-09-24 17:31:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @JDBlack26 @nightnurse38 He served....that's how. Every current & former military member I know will stand/honor the flag/anthem when it is played, even if.... (1/2)
912005154441973762 2017-09-24 17:25:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @JDBlack26 I never said he didn't have a choice.
912004575405789189 2017-09-24 17:23:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ebron85 @SBSlowbro One player, an OL who served in the Army, stood in the tunnel with hand over heart for the anthem. That is now a topic of discussion.
912004223717511169 2017-09-24 17:22:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones Doesn't make me feel bad at all. You're correct, though, about whether or not Tomlin knew. That will be a key point to find out.
912003908373016576 2017-09-24 17:20:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DME123456789 Um, no....not remotely what I said or even insinuated. You're making some giant assumption leaps here....
912003702957002752 2017-09-24 17:20:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ebron85 @SBSlowbro Not the whole team....
912003584086159365 2017-09-24 17:19:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones I don't completely agree, but I can see how you could view it that way.
912002031287709696 2017-09-24 17:13:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @DME123456789 Um, no....
912001159673663499 2017-09-24 17:09:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @JDBlack26 Yes, he chose for himself. I didn't insinuate otherwise.
912000190739083265 2017-09-24 17:06:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones Damn, already deleted....
911999749544402944 2017-09-24 17:04:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones He served in the Army. It's different for him.
911998736645181441 2017-09-24 17:00:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall ok, new favorite phrase alert: "Jick Jacks"  Awesome....
911998439998844929 2017-09-24 16:59:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @SkinWade As would I.....although, he is pretty good with back & forth on here.
911998088910393344 2017-09-24 16:57:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChadKubisNC @TrevorRosenfels Why are you directing this to players?
911997803370549248 2017-09-24 16:56:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChadKubisNC Are you really this obtuse or are you just trying to instigate?
911986505706622976 2017-09-24 16:11:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NFLFanStyle @jaymelamm So, how did you get out of the dress the other night, and how is the arm today?

911971133175603200 2017-09-24 15:10:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall Keep shouting....as will I.
911970559394754561 2017-09-24 15:08:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall Logic & reasoned thought really aren't points of strength for Trumpkins....
911969555496435713 2017-09-24 15:04:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @stevenmnuchin1 So, pro athletes only have a right to free speech when they're not at work? Interesting stance.... #ReadTheConstitution
911968187746603008 2017-09-24 14:58:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris It still makes me react like....pic.twitter.com/QIyWBdWtmL
911967444998205441 2017-09-24 14:55:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I am constantly SMDH at people who say/think "Your peaceful protest is fine as long as you do it in a way that I approve of."
911960613701799936 2017-09-24 14:28:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade And as a Mavs fan, I feel the same about Pop.
911958186885877762 2017-09-24 14:19:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JavanFelix3 Agreed....but I think it's more important for the owners to do so in this case.
911957794697474050 2017-09-24 14:17:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JavanFelix3 Pete Carroll has....
911838316370235392 2017-09-23 06:22:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dannyshort4 Sleep well in your bubble
911835830855053313 2017-09-23 06:12:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dannyshort4 Your initial reply to Evan says otherwise
911834085420650496 2017-09-23 06:06:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MLB @NFL @terri_dub @Evan_P_Grant @dannyshort4 On the off chance you're not a bot, and are a real person named Danny....  Hoo boy.....you have some issues that need dealing with, brother.
911833491582660608 2017-09-23 06:03:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MLB @NFL @terri_dub @Evan_P_Grant @dannyshort4 ....says the bot trying to convince me otherwise.
911832968418791426 2017-09-23 06:01:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MLB @NFL @terri_dub @Evan_P_Grant @dannyshort4 Might be....  I might also be right. I'll go with the 2nd option.
911832727531507712 2017-09-23 06:00:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant I respect Delino's decision on how he wants to handle this, just as I respect Maxwell's, regardless of whether or not I agree. Freedom, man.
911831918471254017 2017-09-23 05:57:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MLB @NFL @terri_dub @Evan_P_Grant @dannyshort4 *sniff sniff*.....I smell a bot.
911831408322244610 2017-09-23 05:55:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @radams4805 In what way is this a political statement?
911830777440194561 2017-09-23 05:52:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MLB @NFL @Evan_P_Grant @terri_dub Then I suggest you quit watching sports for a while, because the two are, and always have been, intertwined.
911830271200243713 2017-09-23 05:50:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JaneMLB @BrandoTheReal Wow, this is a massive load of horseshit

911786274373210112 2017-09-23 02:56:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @aaroninarizona @MarkHolder27 You have yet to answer the question as to what the reason is that you find so invalid after claiming it to be so. Are you able to?
911784231759749120 2017-09-23 02:47:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @aaroninarizona @MarkHolder27 What is this reason that you find so invalid? You either know what it is or you don't. Why do you fear being proven wrong so much?
911783053411930112 2017-09-23 02:43:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @aaroninarizona @MarkHolder27 What is the reason that you find invalid? I want you to say it.
911781305523884034 2017-09-23 02:36:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> She is trying SOOOO HARD to become the @TomiLahren of sports. It's pretty sad....https://twitter.com/BrittMcHenry/status/911774459505373184
911780879701291008 2017-09-23 02:34:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @aaroninarizona @MarkHolder27 And that reason is what?
911780327160467457 2017-09-23 02:32:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @aaroninarizona @MarkHolder27 Plus, try spelling his name correctly....it makes you look even more foolish.
911780181651677184 2017-09-23 02:31:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @aaroninarizona @MarkHolder27 I know why he is protesting. He has said as much. Do you know why he is?
911778884609245184 2017-09-23 02:26:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @aaroninarizona @MarkHolder27 You are the one avoiding the question I asked you after the charge you made. If you can't answer it, your entire argument is invalid.
911778201877319680 2017-09-23 02:23:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak No catch
911777760527478784 2017-09-23 02:22:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @aaroninarizona @MarkHolder27 Again, you made the charge, not me. So again, I ask....what do you think Kaepernick is protesting that you believe isn't true?
911776470967767040 2017-09-23 02:17:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @aaroninarizona @MarkHolder27 Still waiting....

911717488286683139 2017-09-23 22:22:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @JetSweeps He couldn't be any more of a 'Bro' if he was actually TRYING to play to the stereotype....
911716887301689349 2017-09-23 22:20:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @aaroninarizona @MarkHolder27 That isn't an answer to the question, nor is it a defense of your claim.
911716397201412096 2017-09-23 22:18:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @MarkHolder27 Nice attempt at a dodge, but I don't think so. You made the claim....you provide the information and defend it.

911714414369402880 2017-09-23 22:10:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Those two would move the needle significantly, but.....
911713733386342402 2017-09-23 22:07:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @MarkHolder27 Ok, please enlighten me. What do you think Kaepernick is protesting that you believe isn't true?
911709658469068801 2017-09-23 21:51:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @MarkHolder27 I am pretty sure he does. Doesn't seem like you do, however....
911709050018164737 2017-09-23 21:49:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @MarkHolder27 No it doesn't, because that isn't what he was protesting.
911613095356899329 2017-09-23 15:27:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ebron85 @AstronaughtE @thembijazz IMO, a walkout would alienate some of their supporters, which is why I think it would be too far.
911611479853584384 2017-09-23 15:21:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @BrokerDaveT People are unimportant? Interesting stance....
911608655560273921 2017-09-23 15:10:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen @BuckeyeBob614 You should use this thing called the "internet". It's amazing what kind of information you'll discover....

911600256420388864 2017-09-23 14:36:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ebron85 @jimdou88 You do understand how season tickets work, right?

911588908357636097 2017-09-23 13:51:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I said stronger than I thought it would be. I was expecting basically nothing.

911447573768081408 2017-09-22 04:30:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ebron85 @AstronaughtE The main reason I wouldn't is because they would lose some of the people who support them
911446827274207233 2017-09-22 04:27:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @druceleroy I would say "unbelievable", but at this point....is it really?

909280206581616640 2017-09-16 04:57:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TomTheHerman And sometimes, people have to be sacrificed in order to build it.....  I know where to start.
909279619882344450 2017-09-16 04:55:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> Tim Beck should have to find his own flight home, then have his office belongings waiting for him in the hall when he gets there.
909275490564927489 2017-09-16 04:39:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TomTheHerman *Tim
909275388727132160 2017-09-16 04:38:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TomTheHerman Can you take Time Beck with you and leave him on the side of the PCH somewhere?
909274863742877696 2017-09-16 04:36:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> Not only should @Coachtimbeck be fired, he should have to pay for his own flight home.
909273593229533184 2017-09-16 04:31:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch But it has been too big for Tim Beck
909273329646936064 2017-09-16 04:30:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Yeah.....little bit.
909272632750637057 2017-09-16 04:27:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 That was Jones' fault
909263997102379010 2017-09-16 03:53:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin Can they fire Tim Beck tomorrow?
909263687407546368 2017-09-16 03:52:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> .@CoachTomHerman needs to start calling the plays himself. The @Coachtimbeck gameplan and play-calling has been an abject disaster.
909263170065362945 2017-09-16 03:50:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch @DMcComasOB It was his chin and the side of his helmet
909262811162861568 2017-09-16 03:48:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @gkketch And I'm pretty sure it's a penalty in college
909262674936127488 2017-09-16 03:48:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 No, but it is the blow to the head of a QB
909262207489331200 2017-09-16 03:46:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Blow to the head of the QB isn't a penalty in college??
909258291485782016 2017-09-16 03:30:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I thought GGG would get Canelo in the late rounds with a TKO
909254301482209280 2017-09-16 03:14:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> .@Coachtimbeck has some serious questions to answer
909247466754764800 2017-09-16 02:47:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRosner3 Lol
909245153386299392 2017-09-16 02:38:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 His job isn't to chase the RB down the field
909245010146725888 2017-09-16 02:37:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Yes, he is there in case Darnold does run. Jones caught that ball 25 yards down field.
909244607443144704 2017-09-16 02:36:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 That play wasn't Wheeler's fault, regardless, but on the 3-man rush he was spying Darnold
909241567566757888 2017-09-16 02:24:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @srr50 And a TERRIBLE pursuit angle by Holton Hill
909240070305206273 2017-09-16 02:18:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo That wasn't on Orlando
909237868060708864 2017-09-16 02:09:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> FIIIIIIGHT!!!!!!!
909230604750872576 2017-09-16 01:40:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> Every Longhorn fan light every freaking candle you have for @Connorwi1liams, as he it out for the rest of the game.
909220482871959552 2017-09-16 01:00:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRosner3 Bottom line, if you don't trust him from that distance, he shouldn't be your kicker
909219602693009408 2017-09-16 00:57:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRosner3 Maybe a little, but there was too much penetration in the middle
909219355392712704 2017-09-16 00:56:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRosner3 The third was blocked
909219297855201282 2017-09-16 00:55:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRosner3 Obviously....he missed them, but from 35-36 yards, let him try.
909218723176820736 2017-09-16 00:53:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRosner3 All 3 attempts were over 40 yards. This one would have been 35-36

909186058285408258 2017-09-16 22:43:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean I have a couple of things I would like to do for the family that I would like to run by you. Also, if you need any help with anything, holla

909170864163311617 2017-09-16 21:43:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @twoadayz Seems legit....
909163295822827522 2017-09-16 21:13:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Yes, he can, but it also helps when NONE of the 4 defenders around him jump to try and defend the ball. That was terrible.

909092102054785025 2017-09-16 16:30:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn I'm sayin'....  It was 2nd down, though.

908701895451140097 2017-09-15 14:39:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TomTheHerman Um, coach....it was 44, not 41

908488686995681280 2017-09-14 00:32:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CSimmsQB IMO, the way the Longhorn fanbase has treated him is absolutely shameful. It bothers me to this day.

907068944326041600 2017-09-10 02:31:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @keithlaw Talk about in the pre-game, halftime, or post-game. During the game? Nah....
907062010571096065 2017-09-10 02:03:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde This is, in many ways, because the Giants offense SUCKS, especially without Beckham. They can't run for shit because their OL is garbage.
907061654948642816 2017-09-10 02:02:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm Oh yeah.....

907055771065765888 2017-09-10 01:38:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @englanumd I don't have one. I was fine with what they did.
907055620595085313 2017-09-10 01:38:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @englanumd You think that explains the situation in detail? Ok....
907055426323304449 2017-09-10 01:37:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving I think the ref told him they ruled forward progress was stopped

907054416246779904 2017-09-10 01:33:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @englanumd So, your gripe is, that in their one acknowledgement of the situation, they didn't give enough detail? Details you already know? Ok....
907053752070414336 2017-09-10 01:30:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @englanumd Damned if they do, damned if they don't
907053382438932480 2017-09-10 01:29:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @englanumd Then they get ripped for not acknowledging it....
907051744177344522 2017-09-10 01:22:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones If Costas wants to get into it at halftime or if they want to discuss it pre & post- game, ok....

907050294067986433 2017-09-10 01:16:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm This....Harrison is REALLY good.

907049164831412224 2017-09-10 01:12:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Should have audibled on 1st down with Giants alignment
907046394053189633 2017-09-10 01:01:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Giants offense STRUH-GGLED in the pre-season. Their OL is not good.
907045971334492162 2017-09-10 00:59:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 2nd & goal looked like a RPO, and Dak just made a bad choice.
907045009442181121 2017-09-10 00:55:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA 2nd down looked like a RPO and Dak chose to pull it out and throw.
907044654507548673 2017-09-10 00:54:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @wingoz Pretty sure 2nd down was a RPO and Dak pulled it out to try and hit Dez on the slant

906982181435834370 2017-09-10 20:46:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SpanningTheLoeb Rick Smith should have been fired long ago
906973265159229442 2017-09-10 20:10:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers I think he needed to be in a 3-4 to be successful. PIT is an almost perfect spot for him.

906969473130917888 2017-09-10 19:55:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn Rick Smith should have been fired long ago. That your OL is THIS bad speaks volumes....

906952501550829569 2017-09-10 18:48:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamelf Great.....get your future injured behind a turnstile OL
906951091509710848 2017-09-10 18:42:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefreemanNFL You obviously aren't watching that game....
906949954932965377 2017-09-10 18:38:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> Why would you put him in behind this turnstile of an O-Line?
906949453726265344 2017-09-10 18:36:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @HoustonTexans O-Line is straight garbage. Rick Smith should be on the phone with Duane Brown right now.
906947800704876546 2017-09-10 18:29:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd Many, many times....
906947244527669250 2017-09-10 18:27:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisbrockman Why? So he can get sacked too?
906946744533045248 2017-09-10 18:25:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> And horrific tackling by the Eagles....
906946513158451201 2017-09-10 18:24:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal THat was a pass
906945521616605187 2017-09-10 18:20:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ColemanESPN Bad offense.....everywhere
906938904191926274 2017-09-10 17:54:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @andrewperloff That doesn't make it somehow not a bad throw
906937429596278786 2017-09-10 17:48:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @McClain_on_NFL The OL without Brown goes from 'meh' to 'horrendous'
906937208057286658 2017-09-10 17:47:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 Not having Duane Brown is so bad for them
906920963383742465 2017-09-10 16:43:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Brunch is fucking awesome! You're just hating if you disagree....

906725297604775936 2017-09-09 03:45:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mrBobbyBones Apparently Buckeye players did something similar in Norman last year when they beat OU handily.
906714863623397376 2017-09-09 03:04:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps You should see the play that caused 3rd & 93.....Yakkity Sax needs to be playing underneath it.

906172170660970496 2017-09-08 15:07:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dpshow Just tell him you're hiding it from him until after his appearance. Reaction should be good content....
906171998581219328 2017-09-08 15:06:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving They do....they're just hiding it from you until after your appearance.

905999613580242945 2017-09-07 03:41:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FO_ASchatz I'm shocked they didn't sneak Brady on either of those. Has he EVER been stopped on that play?
905998890180239360 2017-09-07 03:39:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @25Barnett @keithlaw @airowen I'm sure it was real easy for him to do that with his D1 college & NFL career. His ex-girlfriend? Maybe not so much....

905997771823570945 2017-09-07 03:34:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I tend to agree. I think coaches & scouts are blinded by the bling (big arm).
905997512779198464 2017-09-07 03:33:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal And to give the other side....Smith has been solid, but unspectacular in a lot of big games.
905997282503524352 2017-09-07 03:32:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Oh, I know, but Reid & the Chiefs think he is the future, and when you're talking about a QB, if you think he's the guy, you grab him.
905996590732718080 2017-09-07 03:29:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal They don't expect Mahomes to play until next year at the earliest.

905289996764139522 2017-09-05 04:42:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AmyDashTV Right, so all he is doing is determining if Goodell's decision was made in a manner that was compliant with NFL policy. He says it was.
905289713585704960 2017-09-05 04:41:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer @KnowTheGame60 @jorge_law @WWMcClyde SoundCloud
905283701688475648 2017-09-05 04:17:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AmyDashTV The LEAGUE'S position is that the evidence is credible, and he....again....says it isn't within his authority to question that.
905282327789662209 2017-09-05 04:11:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AmyDashTV Yet he says he did not do so. He literally said it was not his responsibility, nor within his authority, to do a de novo review of the case.
905280202833633281 2017-09-05 04:03:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AmyDashTV I understand that, but it's still related to process. He clearly states it isn't his job to review the evidence to determine credibility.
905278762559971329 2017-09-05 03:57:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AmyDashTV No, Henderson just re-states the NFL's position, then says his job isn't to question the decision but to just make sure process was followed
905277474912776192 2017-09-05 03:52:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AmyDashTV Actually, that isn't really what it says....
905275793374371844 2017-09-05 03:45:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FreddieAndFitz @ColemanESPN @_JLindner @Djpaidnfull Precisely. There is no legitimate evidence to back up her allegation.
905275482048012288 2017-09-05 03:44:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FreddieAndFitz @ColemanESPN Zero. There is no real evidence to support the accusation, plus the entire investigation has been a kangaroo court sham.
905274983710121984 2017-09-05 03:42:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FreddieAndFitz @ColemanESPN @_JLindner Based on what?

905143682353029122 2017-09-05 19:00:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps @WWMcClyde @Ian_A_Boyd You obviously didn't understand my initial response. I wasn't "blaming" Malik. I simply stated he was an equal contributor.
905142548016062468 2017-09-05 18:56:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd @JetSweeps RB contain is not Hughes' job here. He is trailing the RB. This is Malik's primary job here.
905142081110364160 2017-09-05 18:54:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd @JetSweeps You're correct, that's definitely an issue.
905140535995895810 2017-09-05 18:48:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd @JetSweeps Yes the scheme/game plan was definitely part of the problem. Poor play was also part of it.
905140121841926144 2017-09-05 18:46:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd @JetSweeps I wasn't trying to pin anything on Malik. I just said he was an equal contributor

905139014877007872 2017-09-05 18:42:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd I would say he's been an equal contributor to the poor LB play

903832159710048257 2017-09-01 04:09:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thelonghorns12 That's because they didn't get along. Saban would be fine winning every game 9-6 if he could. Also, Lane is a dick.

903653352147492865 2017-09-01 16:18:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy When idiocy sparks a run on supplies, you get forced to react to it.
903490510723006464 2017-08-31 05:31:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @therealmarklane @Sergio_1021 Yes, because he was one of the owners who was pressuring Goodell to suspend Elliott in the 1st place.

903485393311416320 2017-08-31 05:11:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @notthefakeSVP Since you will be in Austin for Saturday's game, would you like to make an appearance on a local pre-game show?

903482390860795905 2017-08-31 04:59:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> Despite the idiocy of some of their fans, media, & front office personnel, the Astros will be an easy team to root for this post-season.

903120863888846849 2017-08-30 05:02:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Pleas keep me in the loop on this, Evan. I will drive in from Austin and join, if I can.

903078944987127808 2017-08-30 02:16:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @leistomania93 Um, no.....I'm simply agreeing with him because he happens to be correct.
902986508981993473 2017-08-30 20:08:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @keithlaw @CrawfishBoxes It has nothing to do with the story the Richard Justice wrote.
902981015777533952 2017-08-30 19:47:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @keithlaw @NoelWeer In this case, yes.
902980236060626944 2017-08-30 19:43:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @keithlaw @rcarr55TCB I know Reid somewhat. I like & respect him. Understandable as it may be, he let his emotions get the better of him in his public statements.
902965628562280448 2017-08-30 18:45:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> This thread.....read it. #TexasStrong #TexansHelpingTexanshttps://twitter.com/Bitterwhiteguy/status/902942221015670784
902941946385231874 2017-08-30 17:11:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> Ok good....The potential relief $$ from the ticket sales has been covered.https://twitter.com/TexansPR/status/902937508077592577

902929996913803264 2017-08-30 16:24:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AaronWilson_NFL @Textros111 Maybe Jerry will just cut a check for what they think would have been raised. I hope he does.
902929466548256774 2017-08-30 16:22:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AaronWilson_NFL @Textros111 The game was going to be one giant fundraiser, though. My guess is it would have raised upwards of $3M or more.
902929013714366464 2017-08-30 16:20:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AaronWilson_NFL @Textros111 I understand, and that is what the 'yes' part is for.
902928281187602433 2017-08-30 16:17:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AaronWilson_NFL @Textros111 Because this late decision by the league potentially eliminates a BIG chunk of relief money that would have been raised.
902924625746808833 2017-08-30 16:03:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers The main problem here is they have potentially eliminated a BIG chunk of relief cash that would have been raised.
902923998064979968 2017-08-30 16:00:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AaronWilson_NFL Yes and no....
902923059908280320 2017-08-30 15:56:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> It's totally understandable, but why wait so late to make this call, especially with the large amount of relief $ that was set to be raised?https://twitter.com/McClain_on_NFL/status/902917773650743298

902684870916308998 2017-08-29 00:10:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RaysBaseball @Rangers @kurtbradley The Rangers were obviously willing to do so
902684645363503104 2017-08-29 00:09:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RaysBaseball @Rangers @kurtbradley Who ever said the Rangers weren't able to do the same?
902679924380766211 2017-08-29 23:50:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rangers @kurtbradley The only thing the Rangers weren't willing to do was swap out, because of the dates. If the swap was for next week, they probably do it.
902678385100509186 2017-08-29 23:44:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rangers @kurtbradley I also think this puts the positions (and mistakes) of both sides in proper perspective....https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/texas-rangers/rangers/2017/08/29/neither-rangers-astros-wrong-hold-line-decisions-baseball

902674263521550337 2017-08-29 23:28:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rangers @kurtbradley Actually, they were going to give proceeds to the Astros for them to do with as they pleased, then give any cost reimbursement to relief.
902673903432151041 2017-08-29 23:26:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rangers @kurtbradley Um, that is what the Rangers were going to do

902395182607470592 2017-08-28 04:59:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rangers @McClain_on_NFL @roybragg That's not really correct, but hey....keep pushing that false narrative for clicks.

902344809083437056 2017-08-28 01:39:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HoustonChron @jennydialcreech @Chron_MattYoung That is a very simplistic, one-sided way of looking at it.

902341381766696961 2017-08-28 01:25:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealGlenMacnow @NumbNutz1980 It is the one thing the Rangers weren't willing to do, so they said no.
902341244361302016 2017-08-28 01:24:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealGlenMacnow @NumbNutz1980 Ryan wanted to completely switch the series' around, but that would have put the Rangers in a bad spot logistically on multiple levels.
902340922511413248 2017-08-28 01:23:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealGlenMacnow @NumbNutz1980 The case is, the Rangers offered to play the series anywhere, including in Arlington (as the visitors) with the Astros getting all proceeds.
902337716825858048 2017-08-28 01:10:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealGlenMacnow @NumbNutz1980 Reid Ryan is framing this (I assume because he didn't get exactly what he wanted) as the Rangers saying "F you". That's not the case.

902326477781430272 2017-08-28 00:26:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN And barring more information, deservedly so....
902323682290401280 2017-08-28 00:15:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealGlenMacnow Learn all the info first, Glen. Reid Ryan is making a mountain out of a mole hill here.
902298915818676224 2017-08-28 22:36:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman @bkaucher It is, but the reason why is important here. Reid left that out.
902298526599786496 2017-08-28 22:35:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman @bkaucher He basically made it sound like Daniels said 'screw you, not our problem'. That isn't what happened.
902295875292196865 2017-08-28 22:24:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman I like Reid a lot, but he also knows why they understandably said no. He should have been more forthcoming about it.
902294809137881089 2017-08-28 22:20:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman If you look at the schedule, you will understand why the Rangers said no to that.
902286764622192640 2017-08-28 21:48:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean I just want to know if it got flooded or not. If it did, then ok. If not, he deserves to be called out.

901546022865862656 2017-08-26 20:44:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> I can wait until the replay to see this train wreck tonight. I will feel better knowing I contributed $0 to it. #MayweatherVsMcGregor

899752257465483264 2017-08-21 21:57:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Right

899724448533803009 2017-08-21 20:06:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert In theory it could work, but you would have to start at the lowest levels, retraining arms.

899377119729528832 2017-08-20 21:06:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @BryanGill317 Actually, no.....we don't.
899377040700395521 2017-08-20 21:06:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @BryanGill317 Btw, you're not alone. No one making this accusation can prove their accusation. It's an assumption based totally in confirmation bias.
899376631390896130 2017-08-20 21:04:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @BryanGill317 Prove me wrong (hint: you can't)
899376010344398850 2017-08-20 21:02:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @BryanGill317 There are teams that don't need him, teams that don't want him for football reasons, & teams that don't want him for media baggage reasons.
899375750394118144 2017-08-20 21:01:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @BryanGill317 Not having a job isn't evidence of a blackball. Also, you can't prove a negative. The burden of proof lies with those making the accusation.
899374389518585856 2017-08-20 20:55:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @BryanGill317 There is no proof that has happened.
899374260891910147 2017-08-20 20:55:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @BryanGill317 That is incorrect. A league-wide blackball means that there has been a collusive agreement/directive among all 32 teams to not sign him.
899373542122377216 2017-08-20 20:52:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @BryanGill317 You are correct. However, there is a world of difference between that and a league-wide blackball, which many claim is occurring.
899361770220945409 2017-08-20 20:05:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert There are definitely teams that can use him, and the Colts are one of them. I just want people to stop with the blacklisted nonsense.
899160264691638272 2017-08-19 06:44:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @MattWilliams06 That isn't an argument for what you're claiming, and this has nothing to do with ideology.
899151747960233984 2017-08-19 06:10:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @MattWilliams06 Trying to pull her flag away is intent to to do harm? In what way, exactly?

899141672906444801 2017-08-19 05:30:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @MattWilliams06 Completely different scenario....
899141584566063104 2017-08-19 05:30:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @MattWilliams06 In that case you WOULD have made physical contact, with the bat. Therefore, it would be aggravated assault/assault with a deadly weapon.
899140783894392836 2017-08-19 05:27:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @thezackmorgan @ginos0 I'm not defending anything. Read earlier responses. I simply said it wasn't assault.
899140388384116736 2017-08-19 05:25:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @MattWilliams06 There is no threat of bodily harm by grabbing her flag & trying to pull it away. Also, there must be physical contact for battery to occur.
899139063613190144 2017-08-19 05:20:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @MattWilliams06 Based what is in the clip, and according to the general legal definition of those two things, no it wasn't. DEFINITELY not battery....
899136032171491328 2017-08-19 05:08:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @thezackmorgan @RIPstian3 I'm sure they would try to charge you with that....because you did it to a cop. Different rules where cops are concerned....
899134011502710784 2017-08-19 05:00:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @thezackmorgan @NIGELTEAPOT Sorry, you are simply incorrect
899132972540071936 2017-08-19 04:56:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @thezackmorgan @NIGELTEAPOT From what I saw on that clip, he did not throw the woman to the ground. Again, I'm only going by what was shown in that clip.
899131994294149120 2017-08-19 04:52:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Hit me up....we can grab a meal or something.
899131489274744835 2017-08-19 04:50:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> Unreal....
899131228254871553 2017-08-19 04:49:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @thezackmorgan @NIGELTEAPOT It's definitely not battery. As to assault, laws vary state to state/city to city/etc, but according to the general definition, it isn't.
899130030500065280 2017-08-19 04:44:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @thezackmorgan @TheMyteeDucks That isn't an apples to apples comparison, but in your scenario, yes....it would be. Felonious aggravated assault, I believe.
899128801325723650 2017-08-19 04:39:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @thezackmorgan @PithyJoe Right, because that's what I said......pic.twitter.com/WuYKktCKdU

899000189012373504 2017-08-19 20:08:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimRunsHisMouth @thezackmorgan Actually, no he didn't. He grabbed her flag & tried to take it. She tripped & fell trying to hold on to it. That's theft, not assault.

898321958458146816 2017-08-17 23:13:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones I never said that, nor did I intend to imply it. If that was how you read it, then I'll do better next time to word it more properly.
898321512243056641 2017-08-17 23:11:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones It shows a level of understanding & introspection on his part, and I think it can be a step towards better unity and healing.
898321009790418944 2017-08-17 23:09:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones 2) If the owner of the team, knowing his franchise's unfortunate history, wants to remove an honor from the person responsible, that's good.
898319828586344448 2017-08-17 23:05:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones 1) I actually do read your mentions a lot, and agree with you more often than not. I think people do to you (a lot) what you just did to me.
898319392441683968 2017-08-17 23:03:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @Wizeguy8357 I was referring (I thought pretty obviously) to this specific situation involving the Red Sox.
898319185180106753 2017-08-17 23:02:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones I give you top marks, though....that's the best usage of a "jump to conclusions" mat that I've seen in a while.
898318305315966976 2017-08-17 22:59:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones That isn't remotely what I meant.
898317879745150976 2017-08-17 22:57:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones If the owner of the team is the one who is instigating this move, then fine.
898310098715586561 2017-08-17 22:26:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @rodbabers @KnowTheGame60 @waltstuart Gracias, sir!
898306587650961408 2017-08-17 22:12:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 The fanbase put FAR too much of the blame during those years on Simms and treated him horribly. It was an embarrassment.
898305674915889153 2017-08-17 22:08:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 I agree....and outside of one game (as big as it was), there were many people responsible for that, including coaches.
898304369225064448 2017-08-17 22:03:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 I am ashamed of how the Longhorn fanbase treated Chris Simms. It was disgraceful, and that's why you haven't really seen him on the 40 since

897621663260528641 2017-08-15 00:50:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @statesman They same day as the UT season opener. I'm guessing attendance will be low.

897576825509031936 2017-08-15 21:52:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @POTUS just defended white supremacist groups as victims, then equated Washington & Jefferson with confederates. Let that sink in.

897573686445834240 2017-08-15 21:40:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @texasdobbs is correct. There were multiple different white supremacist groups there, joining together, preaching hate and inciting violence

897330707193888768 2017-08-14 05:34:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA The problem for the league is, the commissioner has exhausted his credibility with the public, the players, and some owners.
897321943690510336 2017-08-14 04:59:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA Photographic "evidence" that she says he caused, with no proof (that I've seen reported or presented) to back that claim up.

897227329004597248 2017-08-14 22:43:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRuffalo @ZionSelassie247 Then I believe your senses are off. I didn't disagree with the substance of the article. I just offered a small critique of the presentation
897219290847424516 2017-08-14 22:12:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> Mark this down, because you may never see me say this again, but..... Gig 'Em!!https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/897217561271709696
897216085656731648 2017-08-14 21:59:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRuffalo @ZionSelassie247 I just think the last line of his 1st paragraph would have been a more accurate representation of the article, that's all.
897210140822319107 2017-08-14 21:35:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealJamesWoods @butchkaplan @evans1371 This is egregiously false

897209325441208320 2017-08-14 21:32:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @washingtonpost Easy one.... Both.
897202492341202946 2017-08-14 21:05:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRuffalo @ZionSelassie247 Mainly the headline, which I'm not sure if he wrote of not. So, I should have said "the headline" instead of "he", since I'm unsure of that.
897195153986908160 2017-08-14 20:36:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRuffalo He is being a bit hyperbolic, but he does make a number of points that would be hard to argue against.
897186537674342400 2017-08-14 20:01:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm Travis....but after the ridiculous flooding we had a couple of years ago, it did end up getting back.

896086800019488769 2017-08-11 19:11:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball In the interest if being accurate, he wasn't found innocent....he just wasn't charged.
896084386419949568 2017-08-11 19:02:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @miakhalifa So, will you be at the Texas season opener in your Maryland gear?
896083888522510337 2017-08-11 19:00:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GregAbbott_TX What fraud?
896083518773526530 2017-08-11 18:58:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade And that is a gargantuan "IF" right now....
896081958018572288 2017-08-11 18:52:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch @AStonedThrowAwa I'm referring to the public statement from the DA's office
896065246707630080 2017-08-11 17:46:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jeff_Caplan Sure.....
896063559376842752 2017-08-11 17:39:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin If the NFL's history with these types of investigations wasn't WROUGHT with inconsistencies and mistakes, I would give it more credence.
896062657001701376 2017-08-11 17:36:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin Probably.... @justinwells2424
896059426242613252 2017-08-11 17:23:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports @justinwells2424 Don't forget the greatness of Radisav Curcic
896057284953989120 2017-08-11 17:14:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Evidence "not available" to the DA? Did the NFL gain some form of subpoena power that is greater than a DA's?
896052149200707584 2017-08-11 16:54:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch I also am aware of the NFL's poor history with these investigations.
896051953326628864 2017-08-11 16:53:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch Did I say that?
896051890940657664 2017-08-11 16:53:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch But that isn't what they said
896051759495303168 2017-08-11 16:52:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch I'm basing my disagreement on what the authorities publicly stated about this case and their investigation.
896051345676947457 2017-08-11 16:51:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch The woman actually did speak with the cops. One of the reasons given for not charging him was her multiple inconsistencies in her story.
896050975231823873 2017-08-11 16:49:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch You can disagree with the suspension without "putting a cape" on him
896050434380398593 2017-08-11 16:47:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch I'm concerned that the NFL is saying this despite the fact that the authorities didn't arrest or charge him.
896049000109027331 2017-08-11 16:41:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JasonLaCanfora @JGaydoscik @alexbbishop If there were multiple witnesses and doctors agreeing with this, he would have been arrested and charged
896048577436430337 2017-08-11 16:40:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jennydialcreech The NFL has removed themselves from the "legal standard" of proof when it comes to suspension for violations of the personal conduct policy
896047163045695488 2017-08-11 16:34:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jennydialcreech Actually, they can
896046281176621056 2017-08-11 16:30:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jennydialcreech You are, of course, correct....but in this case there is a BIG question as to if anything actually happened.
896045873137954816 2017-08-11 16:29:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RapSheet Then the league needs to show this "evidence"
896045537698426880 2017-08-11 16:27:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Not even arrested....
896045147410051072 2017-08-11 16:26:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports @MikeDoocyFox4 What, based on how the NFL has handled these things until now, would make you think that? If they do, then show it, because I don't buy it

894376224147075073 2017-08-06 01:54:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KenTremendous @STI_Bret In your opinion....also, him not having a job isn't proof of a league-wide blackball
894368831719735298 2017-08-06 01:25:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KenTremendous Ok, if the league as a whole is, as you and others say, blackballing him....then present evidence of it.

894360007571103744 2017-08-06 00:50:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii ok man, I'm looking at this from a pure football standpoint, but you aren't.
894355904329650180 2017-08-06 00:33:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii Him being good in the system is the most important thing to Adam Gase with 5 weeks until the season opener. That's also not a hypothetical.
894351140137185281 2017-08-06 00:15:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RicRenFSSW @andyway22 If you drop @BrockmireIFC lines into your PA announcing, and post them, drinks are on me next time you're in town
894350077782896641 2017-08-06 00:10:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii A pure hypothetical has nothing to do with what we're discussing. Cutler is still the better football fit in Miami
894349310967635968 2017-08-06 00:07:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markschlereth @ShonJ_ @ExpectAFight The bottom line was teams didn't want to bring him in, because of the media Sideshow that accompanied him
894348994863927296 2017-08-06 00:06:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii It still doesn't change my point
894348760331022339 2017-08-06 00:05:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii That's why I said arguably. He had eight more total touchdowns in 2014, but 11 more total turnovers.
894348469456039938 2017-08-06 00:04:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markschlereth @ShonJ_ @ExpectAFight Really? What job opportunity was that? With what team?
894347388525178881 2017-08-06 00:00:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii I have. He threw 18 INTs in '14, 11 INTs in '15. Slightly higher yds & comp % '14, higher QB rating & fewer fumbles in '15
894341874126921729 2017-08-06 23:38:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii I said arguably. Some would say 2014...some 2015. Bottom line is he knows, and was productive in, Gase's systen.
894338163623305216 2017-08-06 23:23:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii No, that didn't occur in 2015
894333430946770944 2017-08-06 23:04:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii So, Cutler already knows the system & was productive in it. Also, the season starts in 5 weeks. I don't see how Kaep is a better fit.
894332406274158593 2017-08-06 23:00:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii *Gase's
894332352297566208 2017-08-06 23:00:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii You're correct. He was awful last year. However, the season before he had arguably his most productive season as a pro in Adam Game's system
894317615228874758 2017-08-06 22:01:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I think the answer is unknown to everyone except maybe Gase himself. However, he knows Cutler is a fit, so here we are.
894314691752853505 2017-08-06 21:50:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @andrewperloff Some people are looking for any reason to gripe about Colin Kaepernick not having a job still
894310166761484288 2017-08-06 21:32:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markschlereth @ShonJ_ Why do you think Tim Tebow quit getting job opportunities?
894310086516105216 2017-08-06 21:31:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markschlereth @ShonJ_ It's not about his stance. It's about the media attention his stance brings. No NFL team wants a backup getting most of the media focus.
894307927317766144 2017-08-06 21:23:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markschlereth @ShonJ_ You are obviously missing Mark's point
894306305812434950 2017-08-06 21:16:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL @superrobii Ok, why not?
894290123961098240 2017-08-06 20:12:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mikefreemanNFL Would you agree or disagree that signing Cutler was the logical move, from a football standpoint?
894288923148595202 2017-08-06 20:07:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aclfestival @acltv @t0n3d0g This is the correct way to do it
894288613667721216 2017-08-06 20:06:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CraigMish But he did sign, so.....
894287266067222529 2017-08-06 20:01:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LifeofKylieonE @dennisdoddcbs @HaleyxDodd No.....
894286013518024704 2017-08-06 19:56:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ananavarro So, we're going to go from Joe Pesci in "Goodfellas" to a White Nationalist version of William Atherton's character in "Real Genius"? Great.

894281966585098240 2017-08-06 19:40:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 @apoplecticfittz If Gallo can start increasing hi OBP, his AVG will increase as a result, IMO. He'll get better pitches to hit, the more patient he is.
894281688523603971 2017-08-06 19:39:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @apoplecticfittz @justinwells2424 or W-L records for QBs....

894280143253975042 2017-08-06 19:32:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 @apoplecticfittz My point is, they are all valuable metrics.
894278352533684225 2017-08-06 19:25:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 @apoplecticfittz Let's not act like AVG & OBP don't matter, though....
894276244384174080 2017-08-06 19:17:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden My personal opinion is that W-L record is a HIGHLY overrated stat for any QB
894274361846358020 2017-08-06 19:09:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Actually, he performed quite well in Gase's offense in 2015, which is probably why they signed him.
894271007309090817 2017-08-06 18:56:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo @RyanSilapan You're both correct. In Cutler's case, the obvious reason IS Case and Cutler's familiarity with the system.
894267563529711616 2017-08-06 18:42:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean My guess would be yes, because he was looking for a job this off-season. He just didn't want to be a backup.
894266552773685248 2017-08-06 18:38:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden In this case, signing Cutler makes sense.

894238905486258176 2017-08-06 16:49:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Taylor_Estes_ @GCMPats I think having to deal with Saban's salty ass on the daily probably has more to do with their general misery
894238568624910336 2017-08-06 16:47:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CNN @AndeWall I'm just glad I won't be seeing her on @cnn any longer. Now, I can completely avoid her, which makes my life better.
894235759712108544 2017-08-06 16:36:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Taylor_Estes_ @GCMPats Alabama wins  A LOT.....you think their media is happy?
894234645700775937 2017-08-06 16:32:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm But you're having fun, at least.... :)
894234452557221890 2017-08-06 16:31:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Taylor_Estes_ Well, I do believe media should strive to (and needs to) stay as objective as possible, but again....human beings....emotions.
894230856834928640 2017-08-06 16:17:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Taylor_Estes_ It's called "human nature"
894228874095210499 2017-08-06 16:09:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Taylor_Estes_ Regardless of if you agree with this or not, if you're respectful & friendly with the media, you're more likely to get positive coverage
894209777391349761 2017-08-06 14:53:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StardustBook @SheaInIrving You know they're going to try to find a way to re-sign you, as well as sign Ohtani
894209192499826688 2017-08-06 14:50:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @usainbolt @rex_rexchapman He is a true freak of nature
894208494676652032 2017-08-06 14:48:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets I wish you great success in your quest
894040400431902720 2017-08-05 03:40:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BradKellner @JClaireBrandon You seriously need to stop making bets, brother.
894027091045474304 2017-08-05 02:47:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin @WWMcClyde can probably detail this better than I can

894025618299531265 2017-08-05 02:41:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters Old school Tecmo or Super?
894025221145014272 2017-08-05 02:39:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin It was my biggest fear as a Cowboys fan after Jimmy left

894014527662108673 2017-08-05 01:57:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @RealRandyFabian I like to believe facts, not conspiracies, and no....she won't
894011406944804865 2017-08-05 01:45:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @RealRandyFabian Not according to charity watchdogs who track how much of their donations charities spend.
894009276192239616 2017-08-05 01:36:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @RealRandyFabian Even if he did, The Clinton Foundation is charity, not a PAC.
894008664352337920 2017-08-05 01:34:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban I'm so sick of this VERY misleading story from conservative media.....

893868958843109376 2017-08-05 16:19:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @billmaher @RealTimers @ralphreed I just saw your appearance. If you truly consider yourself a good Christian, then you are RAGING hypocrite who gives Christians a bad name.
893861914715009024 2017-08-05 15:51:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Of course, like with the Texas policy, if the media as a group would decide to violate it then there's not much the university could do
893857385713987585 2017-08-05 15:33:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 What is even more ridiculous is, they are deploying people to monitor all of these people's social media accounts like big brother.

893850268948987904 2017-08-05 15:04:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KnowTheGame60 @WWMcClyde @CoachSeahorn Thank you, kind sir
893698408590061570 2017-08-04 05:01:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TerranceWill2 Umm.....no.
893690085761314816 2017-08-04 04:28:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps @WWMcClyde The momentum they have built up is borderline unreal
893689496264482818 2017-08-04 04:25:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps @WWMcClyde As I said when Paul was on, I'm still reserving real praise until I see this group win, but you can't ignore what they've done on the trail.

893687642180784129 2017-08-04 04:18:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @JetSweeps To this point, one would be hard pressed to disagree.

893336662541041664 2017-08-03 05:03:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KamalaHarris Federal doesn't need to be $15/hr. Make federal $12/hr and let cities/states that do need $15 do that on their own.

893312851221372929 2017-08-03 03:29:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @sirrod3 Cutler had his best season in 2015 in Gase's system, so he could be ready to play quickly due to familiarity.
893312331433873408 2017-08-03 03:27:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sirrod3 @chrisgb00 Was just listening to Herm Edwards. He & another guy were saying Cutler would be the better fit, because he & Adam Case were in CHI together

892975703184076802 2017-08-02 05:09:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson @JetSweeps Or the media, as a group, could decide to violate this silly policy. I would love to see that happen, personally....

892112466691461121 2017-07-31 19:59:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball If they can't get value for him, then hell yes....keep him.
892111501137502208 2017-07-31 19:55:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Pretty much....I think Kelly said "I'm not working with that jackass. Either he leaves or I do."

892074261971701761 2017-07-31 17:27:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @michikokakutani We tried to tell people....they wouldn't listen.

892024282255167488 2017-07-31 14:08:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMannixYS I hope someone signs Kaep just so people like you will shut up about it

891869581354127362 2017-07-30 03:54:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban The odds would definitely be better that we would be, and we would also be in better shape, economically, as a society.

891833334669729794 2017-07-30 01:30:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Kaepernick7 @ProFootballTalk I wish someone would sign him just so everyone else will shut the hell up about it
891832891470209024 2017-07-30 01:28:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN I'm disappointed in how the fanbase has treated him this year.

891558819469381632 2017-07-30 07:19:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Really, so the EC was designed to be winner-take-all in almost every state?
891558466053038080 2017-07-30 07:17:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Would you agree that the EC no longer works as it was designed to, and hasn't for quite a long time now?
891520843431505920 2017-07-29 04:48:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RepBarbaraLee Unless you're prepared to defend that comment with evidence, I suggest you retract it. If you can back up that comment, please do so now.

891495153743036417 2017-07-29 03:06:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidMooreDMN @dmn_cowboys Because McCown is a camp body who won't be on the final 53. This isn't a story.

891477223240290304 2017-07-29 01:55:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @deer_chair @WWMcClyde That's damn near unforgivable to me
891475697922977793 2017-07-29 01:49:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> Listen to this man, Texas fans. He knows....  He & @justinwells2424 are as tuned in to 'crootin as anyone in the game. @InsideTexashttps://twitter.com/EricNahlin/status/891470806886305792
891473594932449280 2017-07-29 01:40:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @deer_chair When you choose to support someone as abhorrent as Trump because he MIGHT do something about an issue like that, you've lost your way.
891470886431330304 2017-07-29 01:29:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @deer_chair This is part of the problem....it isn't, but also....as a Christian, you're not supposed to sacrifice all other principles in pursuit of one
891469607135055878 2017-07-29 01:24:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @deer_chair So they're willing to sacrifice every other freaking principle in a futile attempt to outlaw abortion? These people need Jesus.

891089314817429504 2017-07-28 00:13:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman @Andrew_Sturgeon @HLpreps There are also clearly some who do, yet their opinions weren't included. It gives strong impression that author agrees w/ the ones quoted
891087727097257988 2017-07-28 00:07:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman @Andrew_Sturgeon @HLpreps I didn't say the words of the media people shouldn't have been in there
891087257142218752 2017-07-28 00:05:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman @Andrew_Sturgeon @HLpreps I'm assuming the slant was purposeful due to the complete lack of an opinion in the article other than negative.
891086988102840321 2017-07-28 00:04:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman @Andrew_Sturgeon @HLpreps Then he should have stated as such. It certainly wouldn't have been difficult to quotevtwitter responses supporting Rex here.
891086499520937984 2017-07-28 00:02:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman @Andrew_Sturgeon @HLpreps Finding people with the opposite opinion would not have been difficult if he wanted to try.
891086341508878336 2017-07-28 00:01:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman @Andrew_Sturgeon @HLpreps Every opinion quoted was either a twitter response, media figure, or broadcaster who was against it. That is an obvious slant.
891084024902549508 2017-07-28 23:52:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman @Andrew_Sturgeon @HLpreps If that's true, his article does not come across that way. He should write a more balanced, less slanted article next time.
891082832080252930 2017-07-28 23:47:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman @Andrew_Sturgeon @HLpreps He asked the question, then answered it using other's words. It's obvious what Jerry was doing. He should've had the guts to write an op-ed.
891080851009806336 2017-07-28 23:40:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman @Andrew_Sturgeon @HLpreps He is strongly suggesting that Rex should be silent when it comes to his political opinions. That is what's wrong with it.

891033867116785665 2017-07-28 20:33:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean It stems from a DWI arrest in December when he was with Seattle. You have to assume the Cowboys knew he might get a couple of games.

890770961284444160 2017-07-27 03:08:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman And I'm talking for 7 years now.... The discussion has never been anything resembling honest.
890769478002331649 2017-07-27 03:02:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rex_rexchapman The entire discussion (primarily from the right) over the ACA has been patently dishonest from the get-go, but no one will admit it.

890385271061139456 2017-07-26 01:36:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant I believe the Rangers will have to offer at least $25M/yr in order to keep him. That's not greed....that's just the market.

890340989918949376 2017-07-26 22:40:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @Ace__Rothstein @HostileCowboy It most-likely isn't the only reason, but it most-definitely was the impetus for him being cut.
890337112633077760 2017-07-26 22:24:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdwerderRFA @HostileCowboy @Ace__Rothstein Probably not, because he wouldn't have been getting cut in response to a false criminal allegation.
890336573383946240 2017-07-26 22:22:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist Oh I know....that was for the guy who asked.
890335483112427520 2017-07-26 22:18:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist They're basically saying that the alleged shoplifting incident wasn't the only reason Lucky was released.

889981357962776576 2017-07-25 22:51:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @BigOMitchell @street_brice The Cowboys are making it bigger news than it should be by how they're handling it.
889981034019868674 2017-07-25 22:49:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @street_brice @BigOMitchell It makes them look bad in the eyes of players (and their agents) who they will want to sign in the future.
889977009316802561 2017-07-25 22:33:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @BigOMitchell @street_brice Then they should have cut him before camp....but they didn't. Cutting him now makes them look bad in the eyes of players.

889948359531917313 2017-07-25 20:39:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs You're correct, Chuck. The @dallascowboys made themselves look like idiots with this. Players (along with their agents) remember this stuff

889934367786663936 2017-07-25 19:44:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @BigOMitchell Actually no he didn't answer the questions. He repeated the same statement over and over again. He never actually answered questions.
889933511867736064 2017-07-25 19:40:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @BigOMitchell If they would just answer the questions honestly people would move on
889933109952696320 2017-07-25 19:39:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @BigOMitchell Bottom line is, if this story didn't break they wouldn't have cut him yesterday
889931106144985088 2017-07-25 19:31:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg They made an honest mistake based on faulty police information. Why can't they just be honest and own that?

889885020713869312 2017-07-25 16:28:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Can the Cowboys rescind the waiver since it isn't official yet?

887759531358531584 2017-07-19 19:42:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch Your stance that "suspension = evidence" doesn't have basis in fact unless the NFL presents said evidence.

884493411482468352 2017-07-10 19:23:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn @CoreyElliot This is the action of an immature young man who doesn't yet understand what it means to be a professional.

884173174778318849 2017-07-09 22:11:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheLaurenSpears @themeredith I would do that to kick off a date, then take you out afterwards if given the go-ahead to do so.
884163164371378176 2017-07-09 21:31:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Fast forwarding to that would be very quick with me.... @TheLaurenSpears
884122038113374208 2017-07-09 18:48:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MisterRoast98 If you guys want guaranteed contracts, you'll probably have to strike to get it. Are you and the rest of the players prepared to do that?
884091622455222272 2017-07-09 16:47:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> So, as tends to happen with a phone transfer, I lost some contacts. It's such a joy, so....send me yours if I had it before. Thanks.

883895269305331712 2017-07-08 03:47:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MacEngelProf @WWMcClyde So, every game of every homestand, you're in there talking to the guys?

883832773328461825 2017-07-08 23:38:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattmosley @geronimolomax @dlwinthrop My point is it's not an exclusively Texas thing. It's an overall southern thing.
883802300178890757 2017-07-08 21:37:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 He's got to get his outside jumper better, but otherwise? Damn....
883801303364796416 2017-07-08 21:33:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @calvinwatkins @mikecwright Nope on which part?
883800681676779520 2017-07-08 21:31:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattmosley @geronimolomax Texas? Not necessarily.... Southern? Definitely....
883799984767893505 2017-07-08 21:28:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikecwright @clarencehilljr @calvinwatkins They will have to be willing to strike in order to get it, and from what I've seen, the NFLPA doesn't have an appetite for missing checks.
883796066054832128 2017-07-08 21:12:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers I'll go Keone Kela. He emerges as the close in the 2nd half and helps settle the bullpen.

883488748146753536 2017-07-07 00:51:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @chrisgb00 I love Ahmad, but he's admittedly a huge homer. That Miami team was devastating.
883488379513565185 2017-07-07 00:50:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @chrisgb00 Probably, but Texas would have gotten smoked by that Miami team.
883487945340145664 2017-07-07 00:48:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @WWMcClyde I met Major soon after he finished playing & know a couple of his friends. I'm fine with him, but I've heard enough stories the other way.
883486857123770368 2017-07-07 00:44:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @WWMcClyde To this day, I'm feel ashamed of how Longhorn fans treated him. Totally undeserved....
883486542978830336 2017-07-07 00:43:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @WWMcClyde Never met Chris personally, but I know one of his good friends, Rod Babers. Heard nothing but good things about Chris.....
883486191416471552 2017-07-07 00:41:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @WWMcClyde He was more physically talented for sure. The mental acuity & performance in pressure moments, though? You can easily argue Major was better
883485408302170112 2017-07-07 00:38:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 I actually think of it more as a low-light for Mack

881386472754077697 2017-07-01 05:38:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr I'd pay for that....
881386244911112192 2017-07-01 05:37:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean Judges influenced by the home crowd, yes....it's still home cooking.
881386011594457088 2017-07-01 05:36:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AdiJoseph Two of those 4 are this fight and the 1st Bradley fight, so.....
881384443331661824 2017-07-01 05:30:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Good stuff....
881384220727410688 2017-07-01 05:29:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Chris_Broussard Not even....Pac-Bradley was a split decision and a closer fight.
881384043136286720 2017-07-01 05:28:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @calvinwatkins It really wasn't that close....
881383940451434496 2017-07-01 05:28:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris The irony is THIIIIIICK.....
881381452587380737 2017-07-01 05:18:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @espn @thatsean And I can understand why you would feel that way.....
881381046721425408 2017-07-01 05:16:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Sam_Vecenie Straight up told the kid he thought he lost....
881380854504861697 2017-07-01 05:15:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Teddy said the judges gave him a participation trophy, lol....
881380323652767744 2017-07-01 05:13:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Until the decision was announced....then it all went away.
881379938040983553 2017-07-01 05:12:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr The same judges who scored the Pac-Bradley fight
881379497391640576 2017-07-01 05:10:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs It does go to the judges sometimes, but I can't remember ever seeing decisions like this go down.
881378999095701504 2017-07-01 05:08:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsCenter You mean the judges shocked the world by handing him a decision he didn't earn?
881378613714706432 2017-07-01 05:06:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs Tonight, for sure. Bradley was a closer fight than this.
881378482764357632 2017-07-01 05:06:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @Bitterwhiteguy Yup....straight garbage, home country decision. Literally robbery....
881378070443294724 2017-07-01 05:04:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert 117-111 or 116-112 Pacquiao. Just horrific scoring by the judges. Tim Bradley is trying to hem & haw because the same thing happened for him
881377045221171201 2017-07-01 05:00:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> Straight up hometown scoring decision. To say Horn won the fight is absolute garbage. Entertaining fight....judges should never work again.
881376579166797825 2017-07-01 04:58:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Sam_Vecenie Aggression with results, yes....but he wasn't getting results.
881376266380861440 2017-07-01 04:57:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr This is why a lot of people hate boxing. That decision is straight garbage.
881376111325847554 2017-07-01 04:56:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @calvinwatkins Should be unanimous
881375549674766336 2017-07-01 04:54:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Chris_Broussard 8 rounds to 4 for Manny is the closest this fight should be scored.
881375249568342016 2017-07-01 04:53:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert He adds nothing to nothing outside of NBA discussion.

881254159793741824 2017-07-01 20:52:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Pitch count limits....I get that. He was up against it....maybe a bit over, but still.....one more batter? Let him try to finish the 7th.
881252963725053952 2017-07-01 20:47:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump You won' release your tax returns. What are you trying to hide?
881188633243525120 2017-07-01 16:31:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SandlerJ I was at that game. Dutch was dominant.
881182072848691201 2017-07-01 16:05:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Just tone down engagement with obvious idiots. Save it for questions/comments with some legitimacy.
881173949505253378 2017-07-01 15:33:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sirrod3 @chrisgb00 I get that, but it's still a bad look to rip on HS recruits on the air for changing their minds.
881160757311832064 2017-07-01 14:41:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sirrod3 @chrisgb00 Personally, I think that's something they should stay away from doing on the air.

880973468870823936 2017-06-30 02:16:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde My favorite was when the guy checked 2B with no one there. Nadel about lost it....
880973273017839617 2017-06-30 02:16:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd None....and he may convince Westbrook to force a trade.

880675694975623169 2017-06-29 06:33:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Yeah, if he were to attempt it, it couldn't happen like that to truly work. It would have to be him alone....being honest. Same with Cube...
880673749607075840 2017-06-29 06:25:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Dre is another one I'd love to see try, hehe....
880673401505026049 2017-06-29 06:24:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris He still has the skills to do it, lyrically, but could he be this introspective? Who knows....but I'd love to hear him try. 
880672275485392897 2017-06-29 06:20:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I think Cube still could, but that's just my novice opinion.

880518481128587264 2017-06-29 20:08:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @MarkRosner3 @Bitterwhiteguy I never understood why they brought her back to begin with.
880517857477578752 2017-06-29 20:06:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade @BenRogers @1053thefan I wish I had known about this contest sooner. However, is there any way to enter if you live outside of DFW & can't attend the remote?

880226726311342080 2017-06-28 00:49:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen That. Was. Awesome.
880221863342944256 2017-06-28 00:30:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris lol - he is annoying, but that's not what I mean. I think he's a better on-ball defender than CP right now.
880221560237326336 2017-06-28 00:29:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Agree to disagree. I think Beverly is a better man-on-man perimeter defender than Paul right now.
880221038482776066 2017-06-28 00:27:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris No he's not.
880220228399116288 2017-06-28 00:23:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris And remember, they still have the same coach who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'defense'.
880220089311735808 2017-06-28 00:23:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris It doesn't make them better overall, because right now they're worse defensively than before. Better offensively? Yes. Defensively? No.
880219407728902145 2017-06-28 00:20:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I'm waiting to see who else they add. This trade, alone, does not make them a better team.
880213636509294592 2017-06-28 23:57:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Significantly.....
880213198707838977 2017-06-28 23:55:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @newyscruggs Same goes for (No D)'Antoni
880212412108079106 2017-06-28 23:52:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @espn_macmahon When? Next summer? They're sure not getting either one now. The Knicks firing Phil means no buyout for Carmelo.
880211738934824965 2017-06-28 23:50:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports @WWMcClyde I hope they don't, but I wouldn't put it past the Mets. The little brother syndrome of that franchise is real.
880211225883402240 2017-06-28 23:48:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports @WWMcClyde Who says Alderson would make that call? Like you said, he didn't deserve this promotion.
880210308232617985 2017-06-28 23:44:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports @WWMcClyde I have no doubt the Mets will do it simply to put butts in seats & get media attention in September
880209414577422340 2017-06-28 23:40:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports If they're out if it, he'll be a Sept. 1st call-up.
880208562001149952 2017-06-28 23:37:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JonesOnTheNBA I'm waiting to see who else Houston adds. This trade, alone, does not make them a better overall team. (No D)'Antoni is still their coach.

879883807515652096 2017-06-27 02:07:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Choo was too deep, period.
879882944189431809 2017-06-27 02:03:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports @BenTaylorTX This is a fantastic response, and the correct one....with one caveat:  I want to be at the next table so I can enjoy the whole conversation.

879848920783958016 2017-06-27 23:48:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Funny thing about that story that "forced" people to resign....CNN didn't say the story was wrong. They said it didn't have enough sourcing.

879222932236640256 2017-06-25 06:20:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @IsaacDovere Bring your cameras and use them. Force them to throw you out....if they have the balls.
879222025507811328 2017-06-25 06:17:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Acosta Show up with your cameras anyway, and use them. Make them force you out.
879221892791635968 2017-06-25 06:16:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KeithOlbermann Keith, I think that's what they want. They're trying to push the media towards covering them less. The response is to show up & use cameras.

878046628564918272 2017-06-22 00:26:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal He needs to toughen up. He's really soft.
878037995684626434 2017-06-22 23:52:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ColemanESPN I changed the channel to @NBATV....pass that along to your bosses.

878028781151277056 2017-06-22 23:15:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsBuffet1 'Sadly' is a good way to put it.
878028395732496384 2017-06-22 23:14:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsBuffet1 Who is this 'we' you speak of? I could care less, and this world would be a better place if he was never seen or heard from again.
878021189020426240 2017-06-22 22:45:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman I flipped over and had to double-check that I wasn't watching a Rangers game.
878020629131173888 2017-06-22 22:43:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 It takes real effort to do so, IMO....
878019503963070465 2017-06-22 22:38:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 I actually think Ball is a really good player, and seems to be a good kid. I'm trying not to let Lavar color my opinion of Lonzo.
878017774236430337 2017-06-22 22:32:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 Well, then get ready for the fuck up. I'd be shocked if they don't take Ball.
878016820749283328 2017-06-22 22:28:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 So, you're on board with Big Baller Brand?
877981779365199873 2017-06-22 20:09:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SandlerJ I've never understood how thar qualifies as "Quality".
877980626795638784 2017-06-22 20:04:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @leilarahimi Happy Birthday!
877979635249799169 2017-06-22 20:00:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MLB @BryanDolgin Hitters this year seem more concerned about launch angle, less concerned about Ks. More uppercut in swings = more HRs.

877586179918618624 2017-06-21 17:57:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedlieu Yes, it's possible....if they'll quit fighting amongst themselves about the past & start seeing the forest instead of focusing on the trees.

877361160336666625 2017-06-20 03:02:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mxhancock @SeanCBass I don't agree with that, but we won't know until we see it.
877359393439928320 2017-06-20 02:55:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Low-mid 80s for the umps compared to upper 90s for the computers
877358661797945345 2017-06-20 02:53:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I know that, but it's been shown to be much more accurate than the umps
877357785478049792 2017-06-20 02:49:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Hey, if a guy is consistently getting it right, you won't hear me say anything.
877355865833062400 2017-06-20 02:41:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanCBass If strikes are getting called accurately, I'll be fine with it.

877354877067771906 2017-06-20 02:37:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde the strike zone has become......questionable.....this inning.
877344865662709761 2017-06-20 01:58:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde like I said......since I was 12

877209024361529344 2017-06-20 16:58:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Aaaaand we have another sign of the apocalypse.....
877015200951611392 2017-06-19 04:08:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Probably true
877014628454338561 2017-06-19 04:05:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde And I tend to agree if you don't have a guy you know you can depend on.....right now, the Rangers just don't.
877013862314278912 2017-06-19 04:02:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde The bullpen is already blown up this season, but regardless, that's not what I'm suggesting. I'm just suggesting using Kela more in the 9th.
877013361187225600 2017-06-19 04:00:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde This, I agree with....
877013275350900740 2017-06-19 04:00:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde My basis is just from watching. Just my opinion....  Last 7 appearances: 2 Sv, 2 Bl Sv, 2 Ls, 1 terrible inning in a non-save situation.
877012244579667968 2017-06-19 03:56:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Right, but he's had high pitch counts in almost all of them, and I know that's a concern within the club.
877011879507394563 2017-06-19 03:55:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde To me, it seems like the secondary stuff just isn't quite fully there yet.
877011679921483776 2017-06-19 03:54:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde His location/command has been spotty the last few weeks. Add in the concern about over-use, and maybe give Kela a few more chances to close.
877009235485360129 2017-06-19 03:44:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde It may be time to let Kela have a shot at closing
877005412846981120 2017-06-19 03:29:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StevensonFWST You needed to expand further....makes sense.

876875176625016834 2017-06-19 18:51:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer @bomani_jones And it certainly wouldn't apply, historically, to anywhere near that much of the country now.
876875013193961472 2017-06-19 18:51:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer @bomani_jones The problem is, that "original purpose"  you refer to only existed, at that time, in half the country, at most.
876870664946425856 2017-06-19 18:33:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer @bomani_jones The one he chose to use is over a century and a half old, and (if he was referencing th Castile tragedy, specifically) wasn't apropos, IMO.
876870075248254978 2017-06-19 18:31:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer @bomani_jones Perhaps one that is more current and deals more directly with how police departments are training their officers & handling these situations
876865048802725892 2017-06-19 18:11:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer @bomani_jones I don't necessarily disagree with that point. I just think he chose a poor anaolgy to illustrate it.
876862944398774273 2017-06-19 18:03:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer @bomani_jones Yes, I do, but that's not the topic being discussed.
876860666879119361 2017-06-19 17:54:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer @bomani_jones Definitely not baseless, historically, but also not a great analogy to use when discussing current events, no?

876668564224299008 2017-06-18 05:10:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinHogan It's time to institute K-Zone technology for calling balls & strikes. Umpires simply can't do it accurately enough, and this can be proven.
876588774398074880 2017-06-18 23:53:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg The conditions (especially Saturday) made this course easier to play, IMO.

876524450790998017 2017-06-18 19:38:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> This is UNACCEPTABLE. It's time to take balls & strikes away from umpires. #KZonesInMLB https://twitter.com/CJNitkowski/status/876521925073412100

875943307968425984 2017-06-16 05:08:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 There's only one legitimate question that this fight asks, and it's one not worth paying for.

875889166927765504 2017-06-16 01:33:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @WWMcClyde @Evan_P_Grant Possibly, but he stays is pretty good shape, IMO.
875888804774674432 2017-06-16 01:32:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @lonestarball @WWMcClyde I'm  thinking .245-.255 avg, 20-25 HRs, 60-70 RBI. OPS would be ok, but not great.

875528137400045568 2017-06-15 01:39:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs It's an interesting perspective, to be sure. However, if they do as @sallyjenx suggests, I'm guessing an invite won't even be issued. (1/2)

875158209593581568 2017-06-14 01:09:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN That evens out Altuve's BS double in the 1st
875157399056809984 2017-06-14 01:05:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ColemanESPN Confidence is something he will never be short on. It's the requisite skills that he lacks.
875156967089725440 2017-06-14 01:04:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Always important to consider the ancillary factors.....
875154266679365632 2017-06-14 00:53:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FOXSports @dennisonfox7 People just WANT Mayweather to lose. If you're picking McGregor, you're doing so based on pure emotion.

875148301611532288 2017-06-14 00:29:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I need a Frackers jersey in my life

875116731651510272 2017-06-14 22:24:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde My fantasy team is quite pleased with his decision.
875108613571960833 2017-06-14 21:52:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin Floyd can get a unanimous decision here with his eyes closed. The only intrigue is, will Floyd use his superior skills to try to KO him?
875107698752315392 2017-06-14 21:48:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin I won't shell out a single dollar for this.
875105474001219584 2017-06-14 21:39:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo Floyd's boxing skills so out-match Connor's, that there's a better chance than most Floyd fights that he KOs him.
875103913317478402 2017-06-14 21:33:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinHillsGolf @townbrad @WWMcClyde @BobBallouSports I was not aware of this either. Interesting.....
875102539540201472 2017-06-14 21:27:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Harlan The level of intellectual dishonesty associated with this statement is astounding.
875097108826771456 2017-06-14 21:06:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @megynkelly For someone like Jones, "shining a light" provides him w/ a greater level of exposure than he would otherwise receive. You should know this.

875076873423904768 2017-06-14 19:45:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I completely agree with this
874817836639821824 2017-06-13 02:36:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AC360 @JasonMillerinDC is a SUPREMELY biased Trump sycophant, and like @realJeffreyLord, not worthy of airtime.

874720352433254400 2017-06-13 20:09:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde There has been no such assertion.
874720050749550592 2017-06-13 20:08:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean @JCBelew The AG is refusing to answer questions that he has a legal obligation to answer. He's the one being an ass.

874501011691450368 2017-06-12 05:37:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade Just out of curiosity, how was Barnes misusing him?
874483125631561728 2017-06-12 04:26:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NBA @Bitterwhiteguy No need to figure out a spot. Westbrook can play the 2.
874482713952210944 2017-06-12 04:25:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist @Tepper Lebron averaged 33.6, 12, & 10....but Durant deserved the MVP. His team won in 5.
874482295654285312 2017-06-12 04:23:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist Spare me the advanced analytics. I have eyes. I used them to watch. I'm a Lifetime Longhorn who loves Durant. Lebron was still better.
874479264669859840 2017-06-12 04:11:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist Well, all the numbers disagree with you.....
874478904450404353 2017-06-12 04:09:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist Again, his team was just better. However, that doesn't mean he was the better player.
874478237807783936 2017-06-12 04:07:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist KD was the 2nd best player on the court....for the whole series, but he still deserves the MVP, because his team won in 5.
874477616513855490 2017-06-12 04:04:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer Weak take, Albert....
874477321763344384 2017-06-12 04:03:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot That's fucked up. Dude averaged a 30+pt triple-double in the Finals.
874476947795046400 2017-06-12 04:02:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot That's just plain mean....
874474483154903040 2017-06-12 03:52:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist No he wasn't. He was great, but Lebron was better.
874473849034854400 2017-06-12 03:49:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch Crazy thing is....Lebron was actually better.
874473491873095680 2017-06-12 03:48:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist He wasn't better than Lebron. He just wasn't....but his team was.
874473310821765120 2017-06-12 03:47:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 He was in the zone tonight
874471367936286720 2017-06-12 03:39:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger You mean the guy who's averaging a 30-pt triple-double?
874471092588609538 2017-06-12 03:38:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde HA!!! I'm already picturing it....

874446137197047809 2017-06-12 01:59:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde That's what I meant as well. I can totally believe it's a question in that addled brain of Trump.
874445454053961728 2017-06-12 01:56:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde You can't believe that whether or not to fire Mueller is even a question, yes?

874348755788681218 2017-06-12 19:32:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman If we're talking about sluggers, you really should remove Williams and add Aaron.

873208116283924484 2017-06-09 16:00:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving I think the timing has to do with binding the 2017 class to OU. However, I can understand the speculation.

872581718884143104 2017-06-07 22:31:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I think the timing is tied to his '17 class now being bound to OU as they reported this week, but otherwise, seems to have been in the works

871970629364404224 2017-06-05 06:02:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Actually tonight, we're watching much more....
871969933508440065 2017-06-05 06:00:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters Maybe hide the meth and the whisky too.....
871968706863267840 2017-06-05 05:55:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters How about a Kentucky-Louisville Super? Yikes....
871968396698673152 2017-06-05 05:54:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB It MIGHT have been low. TV didn't show a side view of the pitch. Problem is, these umps don't get the benefit of the doubt.
871966122140209152 2017-06-05 05:44:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott That doesn't make them good pitches. It means that when you have 2 strikes, you sometimes have to offer at pitches out of the zone, in case.
871965659793641473 2017-06-05 05:43:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 I think the plate ump missed that call. Looked like he was still in the box when it hit him.
871965183060717568 2017-06-05 05:41:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott As I said before, they should have been protecting with two strikes.
871964041106911232 2017-06-05 05:36:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott The only one that was was strike 3 to Boswell.
871963622695727104 2017-06-05 05:35:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott That they thought the pitches were balls (they were) so they didn't swing (they should have protected). There was no decision involving hope
871962843003973632 2017-06-05 05:31:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott I'm sure that's what they decided.....come on man.
871962493043826688 2017-06-05 05:30:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch One of the primary reasons I think Texas ends up in the Big 10
871962196565209088 2017-06-05 05:29:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB IT would have been interesting....
871961512671412224 2017-06-05 05:26:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF This "Different strike zone for each team" thing has be ready to punch a wall.
871961168063201280 2017-06-05 05:25:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB I could live with the shit zones if they were just CONSISTENT FOR BOTH TEAMS!!!
871960962676469760 2017-06-05 05:24:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 Nope....wasn't away. It's just Texas not getting the same zone as LB....again.
871958995954794501 2017-06-05 05:16:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @LHSHonFB LB pitchers have been getting inches off the plate the whole weekend. It sucks, but Clemens and Boswell HAVE TO protect on 2 strikes.
871957201426022400 2017-06-05 05:09:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 For one team, yes....
871957095113003013 2017-06-05 05:09:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Both of those were off the plate, but you HAVE TO protect on the 2nd one.
871956795551621120 2017-06-05 05:07:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 That was off the plate, but you HAVE TO protect there
871956360409251841 2017-06-05 05:06:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots Postseason baseball is as good a time as any....

871955592843284485 2017-06-05 05:03:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots So jealous.....  Will you be at the USC game in September, or is that as stupid of a question as I think it is, as I type it?

871954082596040704 2017-06-05 04:57:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @peterwsinger @QueenKika Every act of violence doesn't qualify as terrorism, sorry.....
871953809353977856 2017-06-05 04:56:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @KevinDunn01 That's some quality college baseball shade, right there.....
871949978259918854 2017-06-05 04:40:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 Boy, Riley really uncorked one there.....
871949387387330560 2017-06-05 04:38:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Not from McCann. He has no power.
871949153491972096 2017-06-05 04:37:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kbohls Shane and Gus had an......interesting....relationship.
871946944012320768 2017-06-05 04:28:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival #bullpenisinthecage?
871932392541491200 2017-06-05 03:30:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @peterwsinger @QueenKika It was a disgruntled employee who went in a shot up the place that fired him. That's not terrorism. That's revenge.
871930527024074753 2017-06-05 03:23:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 @josephcook89 @BarkingCarnival @DMcComasOB That's 6 errors by Texas in 2 gms+ vs LBSU, and that's not counting the mental errors.
871928492388225024 2017-06-05 03:15:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival BURN THE WITCH!!!!!
871928359017738241 2017-06-05 03:14:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @peterwsinger It also wasn't terrorism related. That's another reason.
871924409103261696 2017-06-05 02:59:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mrBobbyBones I'm just glad this is a series. Much more compelling than the NBA Finals so far....
871922157399527425 2017-06-05 02:50:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny I'm a little surprised, but Todd has struggled this weekend.
871921433617862659 2017-06-05 02:47:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NCAA @TexasBaseball @TexasSports Seriously....to hell with the @ncaa & @espn for this garbage start time and for starting the Stanford Regional a day earlier.
871915003531710464 2017-06-05 02:21:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UTBaseballEQ @HornSports @espnsbrother @LBDirtbags @TexasBaseball @joeywa_44 Texas' biggest edge tonight? No Costello behind the plate.....
871914638371323905 2017-06-05 02:20:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF Tap 24 tonight? Someplace else?

871832469284294657 2017-06-05 20:53:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 Where did I say automate the entire game? I said eliminate bad officiating calls as much as possible. Not the same....
871832177151004672 2017-06-05 20:52:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LSU_Tigahs Again, you're advocating for keeping bad officiating and incorrect calls. This doesn't make the game better.
871831842936287234 2017-06-05 20:51:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 Now, you're going further than I've ever advocated and moving on to something else. This is changing this subject.
871831491529121792 2017-06-05 20:50:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean A&M would have had another game against Houston tonight, had they blown it

871826372288802817 2017-06-05 20:29:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 The only adjustment that is supposed to be made to a strike zone is one for the height of the batter to sets the top and bottom of the zone
871825759740059648 2017-06-05 20:27:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 bad balls and strikes ARE incorrect calls
871825616999460867 2017-06-05 20:26:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 The strike zone is defined, and I want it called that way. Consistently....game in and game out.
871825301596246018 2017-06-05 20:25:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 I have played it. I've also covered it and called it. You act as if this would be some kind of major, unrealistic adjustment. It wouldn't be
871824764779855873 2017-06-05 20:23:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 The thought that incorrect calls by officials are and should be an important part of the game is just hilarious to me.
871824424214945799 2017-06-05 20:21:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @dontmindme85 @DeepSouthAustin I love how you think getting calls right would somehow lessen the game. That's hilarious.
871824242295308288 2017-06-05 20:21:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 As you said, players already adjust to an umpire's particular zone from game to game so adjustment to a consistent zone would be a quick one
871823529272119297 2017-06-05 20:18:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @dontmindme85 @DeepSouthAustin Is that supposed to be a real reason? Not being able to heckle and umpire as much?
871823331166760962 2017-06-05 20:17:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 No it wouldn't.
871823267115532289 2017-06-05 20:17:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 An advantage they should never have to begin with....either way.
871823013079134208 2017-06-05 20:16:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 I know....what a concept. A consistent and correct strike zone.
871822891825934336 2017-06-05 20:15:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @dontmindme85 @DeepSouthAustin So, because you can't predict the future with 100% accuracy, do nothing? That makes sense....
871822666524708864 2017-06-05 20:14:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 They'll get to college and have a consistent strike zone, game in and game out....imagine that!!
871822501369786369 2017-06-05 20:14:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 Actually, most people argue it will give hitters the upper hand. I think it will make things more even for both.
871821781455310848 2017-06-05 20:11:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 They shouldn't determine the outcome EVER, which is why we should take steps to eliminate them as much as possible.
871820981639290880 2017-06-05 20:08:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 And we should eliminate as many of the bad ones as possible.
871820814559084545 2017-06-05 20:07:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @dontmindme85 @DeepSouthAustin But you can try
871820775765966848 2017-06-05 20:07:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 It will be and we should try to minimize it as much as possible. Players on the field, competing, should determine the outcome, not refs.
871820172570632192 2017-06-05 20:05:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 I disagree
871819882836447232 2017-06-05 20:03:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @dontmindme85 @DeepSouthAustin Yes I am.
871819784995962882 2017-06-05 20:03:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 Nope, I want to take bad officiating out of the game
871819628288372737 2017-06-05 20:02:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 I want to calls to be correct as close to 100% of the time as possible. That way the players truly determine the outcome.
871819179762085891 2017-06-05 20:01:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @dontmindme85 @DeepSouthAustin Yes, I do want to eliminate interpretation on balls & strikes.
871819074396934144 2017-06-05 20:00:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @dontmindme85 @DeepSouthAustin K-Zones already adjust for this.
871818943488561152 2017-06-05 20:00:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 Maybe one day we will, but we're not there yet with technology. Right now, though, we do have the technology to get balls & strikes right.
871818627909132288 2017-06-05 19:58:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 Right, so why would you purposefully avoid using things that will help them do their job better and more efficiently?
871818258898452480 2017-06-05 19:57:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @dontmindme85 @DeepSouthAustin This is just an outdated, silly way to look at it.
871818115713306630 2017-06-05 19:56:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 It shouldn't be is my point. The umpire is there to enforce the rules as written, not as he thinks it should be.
871817086506602496 2017-06-05 19:52:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin @dontmindme85 It's the responsibility of the umpire to call the strike zone as it's supposed to be. This whole "each umpire has his own zone" thing is BS.
871815966803582976 2017-06-05 19:48:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin Depends on what it is you're applying technology to....
871814824321220608 2017-06-05 19:43:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin And he'd still be there....just not calling balls & strikes.
871810781385560064 2017-06-05 19:27:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin What happens when it rains? There's a bit of a delay....it's the same thing.
871810320075034628 2017-06-05 19:25:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB There's not much in MLB either. Look at Joe West....
871808955986694144 2017-06-05 19:20:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @DeepSouthAustin Umpires who have no sense of what the strike zone is also take the game out of players hands.
871808030245085184 2017-06-05 19:16:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LSU_Tigahs Pitchers shouldn't get strike calls if they aren't strikes. There's plenty of adversity in the game on both sides already.
871806988946165760 2017-06-05 19:12:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LSU_Tigahs I'd rather have the calls be consistent and correct.
871806600880762885 2017-06-05 19:11:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> I agree with you there, for sure....
871806257841270785 2017-06-05 19:09:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB College baseball needs a computerized Strike Zone like nobody's business
871806062655045633 2017-06-05 19:08:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB That guy was beyond awful last night
871801192606605312 2017-06-05 18:49:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN Unfortunately for Texas, I don't see how they win more than 8 this season, which means he won't be back.

871726396178972672 2017-06-05 13:52:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean 1. They shouldn't be. 2. They shouldn't be. 3. Um, no....I'll pass.
871604672288612353 2017-06-04 05:48:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB He had a different strike zone for each team. This guys was horrific....
871604234340278273 2017-06-04 05:46:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @BON_SBNation I think Costello ranks at least even with the Dirtbags
871602689154535424 2017-06-04 05:40:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BradKellner I would say the home plate had just as much (if not more) to do with it
871602426981240832 2017-06-04 05:39:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB The last 2 pitches were there, and he missed.
871599037723492353 2017-06-04 05:26:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 I was going to say Shaw, but in a 1-run game, this makes more sense.
871598817585487872 2017-06-04 05:25:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Pinch hit Shaw for Todd to open the 9th
871598536709636096 2017-06-04 05:24:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB The accurate description would be "garbage ump"
871598347609456645 2017-06-04 05:23:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott That missed call changed the momentum of the whole game.
871598129027530753 2017-06-04 05:22:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott I care about the call at the plate a lot
871597776743809024 2017-06-04 05:21:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> This guy is the suck
871597570719596544 2017-06-04 05:20:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 I disagree. His zone has been wider and lower for LB pitchers all night.
871597125460676608 2017-06-04 05:18:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 This plate ump is an absolute embarassment
871596881511567360 2017-06-04 05:17:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman He's had two different zones. One for each time....all night. It's criminal.
871596766629462016 2017-06-04 05:17:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Like I said....one zone for Texas, a different one for LB. All. Night. Long.
871595380693020672 2017-06-04 05:11:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @politico This is really a headline? Seriously?
871594264957812736 2017-06-04 05:07:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Cantu needs to compose himself. He had a really bad inning.
871594053795586051 2017-06-04 05:06:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 E2
871593912246325249 2017-06-04 05:05:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 HE didn't
871592105684066306 2017-06-04 04:58:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival There has been one zone for Texas and another for LBSU. All. Night. Long.
871591271491444741 2017-06-04 04:55:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN He's better defensively than McCann
871590431342993408 2017-06-04 04:52:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 Bad job by Cantu there
871587624640593920 2017-06-04 04:40:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman @BarkingCarnival Now the rum can go to work....
871585389693124609 2017-06-04 04:32:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman @BarkingCarnival I'm jumping in with rally rum....pic.twitter.com/kwJ1Ps1pZD
871584618905862144 2017-06-04 04:29:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @USCocksman I approve of this plan
871579407772639233 2017-06-04 04:08:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @arby10 He didn't. He stepped in front in the process of catching the throw and attempting the tag.
871579070806466561 2017-06-04 04:06:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival I think his hand slid off the guy's shoe and caught the back of the plate @josephcook89
871578812529598465 2017-06-04 04:05:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB This home plate ump is the main reason Texas isn't winning this game.
871578170683564033 2017-06-04 04:03:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman He was set up in front of the plate, inside the baseline.
871577942274457600 2017-06-04 04:02:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 I think they're saving Kennedy for tomorrow.
871577594436534273 2017-06-04 04:01:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @arby10 You can't
871577429805891584 2017-06-04 04:00:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman He was sliding wide to avoid a possible tag. The slide was fine.
871575813333766144 2017-06-04 03:54:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 That's because it was.
871575732840931328 2017-06-04 03:53:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 That. Wasn't. Close.
871574569542336512 2017-06-04 03:49:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 Did they call that a hit? Really?
871573684015603712 2017-06-04 03:45:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 This guy has located and changed speeds well, but this ump's zone has helped him IMMENSELY
871572152830406658 2017-06-04 03:39:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 He swung at ball 4 on that foul
871570752264323072 2017-06-04 03:33:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 It was close, but I think it JUST missed in.
871566808834334720 2017-06-04 03:18:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB The ump has given this guy a HUGE zone so far. It's maddening.
871566376246288385 2017-06-04 03:16:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jeff_Caplan @Kasparov63 Yup.....truly pointless. He is a patently dishonest man.
871564455661850624 2017-06-04 03:08:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Was JUST too much out in front.....
871560543202562049 2017-06-04 02:53:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Look at Alex Claudio....
871560400109568000 2017-06-04 02:52:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Agreed....they need to attack this guy
871559312098734080 2017-06-04 02:48:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 This ump is starting to piss me off. His zone for this junk-thrower is VERY generous thus far.
871559049531109376 2017-06-04 02:47:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB The potential 3rd out, maybe, but not on the DP ball
871558296141824001 2017-06-04 02:44:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB And he would have been out of the inning if not for the errant Boswell relay....

871479048685277184 2017-06-04 21:29:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @KevinDunn01 Someone call Sydney Deane & Billy Hoyle. They've got a chance to win a gold medal now.
871477751533846529 2017-06-04 21:24:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy You're not. All I'm saying is, it doesn't belong in the Olympics.

871475837882609664 2017-06-04 21:16:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman It's been needed, because Rangers fans on Twitter have lost their damn minds.
871468606999085056 2017-06-04 20:48:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamelf If Beltre is still here, probably Gallo. Defense is not Odor's issue right now, it's plate discipline.
871467566383767552 2017-06-04 20:43:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamelf Have you watched Gallo play 3B? He's pretty damn good.
871467455729721344 2017-06-04 20:43:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamelf I disagree
871465785230675969 2017-06-04 20:36:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamelf Why would the Rangers want Baez?
871465602543632384 2017-06-04 20:36:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball He's well on his way to being the next Skip Bayless. If that's what he wants, congrats to him.
871464675136782336 2017-06-04 20:32:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JJT_Journalist Also, Nolan joining the Astros didn't suddenly make them good. They've been building for a few years now.
871457839356694528 2017-06-04 20:05:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I don't hate fun, but this has no business being in the Olympics. However, it's far from the only "sport" that shouldn't be there, so....

871409548988301312 2017-06-04 16:53:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @corbydavidson @LoneSpur1882 I know. I agree with you. That's why I'm saying '11 was not fixed.

871405138899910656 2017-06-04 16:35:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde And the Longhorns are set up fantastically now. Only used 4 pitchers in 2 games.

871236440528572416 2017-06-03 05:25:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @toooast Which is why it's not the best stat or the only stat. See?
871235619359399938 2017-06-03 05:22:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @toooast It is a good stat....it's just not the only stat or the best stat. How about that?

871234435101806592 2017-06-03 05:17:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @toooast My point is, you saying it's a "garbage stat" is a terrible take.
871233473922482176 2017-06-03 05:13:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Just a touch too much under one....just a touch too much towards the end of the bat on the other.
871233243936309250 2017-06-03 05:12:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @toooast Btw, cashing in on opportunities to drive in runs, actually is a pretty decent measure of a hitter.
871233036406239233 2017-06-03 05:11:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @toooast There is a CANYON of difference between it not truly telling you how good a player is....and it being a garbage stat.
871232521354199041 2017-06-03 05:09:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 Reynolds and Cantu BOTH were right on the pitch, but they caught both balls towards the end of the bat.
871232177123479552 2017-06-03 05:08:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs The over-emphasis on analytics is getting silly in baseball
871231691972460544 2017-06-03 05:06:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @toooast RBI is a garbage stat? You're kidding right?

871231030740393984 2017-06-03 05:03:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @McClain_on_NFL Forgot to mention the Volquez no-hitter
871230630058573824 2017-06-03 05:02:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 If he touched the ball when it was foul (it was), is he still out?

871221329428492288 2017-06-03 04:25:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 Unbelievably bad luck that inning.....
871221200848011265 2017-06-03 04:24:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB The throw was just off enough that it clipped the guy. Just terrible luck that inning....
871219450854256642 2017-06-03 04:17:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Would have been bang-bang, but yeah.....bad luck.
871217595424190464 2017-06-03 04:10:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant *AHEM* back-to-back division titles.....
871216962281459712 2017-06-03 04:08:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Baseball Stars was juice on original Nintendo.
871216699952873472 2017-06-03 04:07:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant People calling for Rougie to get sent down, Banny to be fired, hitting coach to be fired, etc.....take a freaking pill and calm down.
871216289594855425 2017-06-03 04:05:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 He barely missed blasting one out in his last AB. He hit this one right on the screws.
871214537944350721 2017-06-03 03:58:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Unfortunately, so is the other guy's....
871211215455895552 2017-06-03 03:45:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigway1 You should tweet out a quick pic of said broadcast position.
871210657005293568 2017-06-03 03:43:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @statesman @BowieGirlsSoftb @uiltexas @Rickyprep I vote yes
871207358269018112 2017-06-03 03:29:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB He just missed that one.....
871205308814696448 2017-06-03 03:21:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer We're things tense but (hopefully) uneventful at the pub you ended up locked down in?
871203569063440384 2017-06-03 03:14:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 I get the attempt with the shift, but in a one run game, I'd rather him swing away.
871203245150019584 2017-06-03 03:13:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 He was safe
871202908406038528 2017-06-03 03:12:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson No problem. Have a good evening.
871201998611161088 2017-06-03 03:08:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson That's not at all what I said or meant. I have no idea who he dates, nor do I care. Plus, his politics have no bearing on this for me.
871200971275108352 2017-06-03 03:04:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson No, it doesn't. The context doesn't make the use of it normalized or acceptable, it just moderates the level repercussions he should face.
871198633940500480 2017-06-03 02:55:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson (2/2)...I certainly found what Kathy Griffin did to be aggregious. There was intent there. Again...context. She's getting deservedly torched
871197722027499522 2017-06-03 02:51:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson However, I wouldn't call it aggregious, again, because of the context. I don't believe there was any ill intent. Now, by comparison... (1/2)
871197416048926720 2017-06-03 02:50:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson I'm a left-leaning moderate. I think what he did was stupid & wrong. He was also arrogant for thinking it was ok for him to make that joke.
871195983459241984 2017-06-03 02:44:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson You're probably right, and yes, many times double-standards do exist. I just don't think the solution is to move TOWARDS extreme reactions.
871194295864250368 2017-06-03 02:38:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson I agree that he was too comfortable saying it & it was wrong of him to say it. All we're really disagreeing on is the level of repercussion.
871192596533485568 2017-06-03 02:31:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith pic.twitter.com/oM7Fqualc1
871192157503111168 2017-06-03 02:29:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson So, you think him having his show cancelled & being fired for simply saying the term, regardless of the context of it, is common sense?
871190979545448448 2017-06-03 02:24:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson I never said it was ok that he did. He was stupid and wrong for doing so.
871190455626588160 2017-06-03 02:22:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson Wanting to look at a situation with a calm mindest as oppose to a scorched earth mentality does not mean I'm normalizing something.
871189465204613120 2017-06-03 02:18:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson Where did you get that I'm normalizing it? You think that because I want to consider the context of what was said, I'm normalizing its use?
871188399461355520 2017-06-03 02:14:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson Pointless? Interesting stance....
871187131540021248 2017-06-03 02:09:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson I'm always willing to have a rational discussion, though....
871186359397920768 2017-06-03 02:06:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson Ok fine....that's up to you.
871185018281799681 2017-06-03 02:01:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson Yes. Maher was referring to, and making a (very bad) joke about, himself. He wasn't directing the comment towards another person or group.

871179306004733953 2017-06-03 01:38:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson I don't think he should be fired...because of the context. A public apology & a suspension sure, but cancelling his show & firing him? No.
871176598472376324 2017-06-03 01:27:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @mr_rod_nelson Yes I would ask, because for me context should always be considered when determining your reaction to things such as this.
871167358911381504 2017-06-03 00:50:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump The courts can't give back something they didn't take away, you dolt....

871149332975689729 2017-06-03 23:39:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @billmaher @sherrodharris And no, it didn't involve me saying it. I'm not an idiot.....
871148664328118272 2017-06-03 23:36:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Have I ever told you my own story involving the phrase @billmaher so poorly decided to use?
871147829753806848 2017-06-03 23:33:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rangers @WWMcClyde Yes he did....it was a win-win him and the Rangers.
871147537188519936 2017-06-03 23:32:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I'll always be grateful to him for his part in helping the @Rangers reach the World Series.

871131114076749824 2017-06-03 22:26:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mtracey In no way, shape, or form did she "shove" you. Stop lying. The video shows you are lying.
871130722588794880 2017-06-03 22:25:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I've seen the video. She didn't shove him. That is a lie. @mtracey
871057840831475712 2017-06-03 17:35:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr What do you believe an appropriate reprimand/punishment would be?
871049245326848000 2017-06-03 17:01:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UberFacts @cmkuiper Or, it's an expression of frustration at a person who refuses to listen to the many logical rebuttals you already made
871012273275387905 2017-06-03 14:34:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Been there, brother.....earlier this week, in fact.

870889822906228737 2017-06-02 06:28:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers The fact that his plate discipline is actually getting worse is a MAJOR issue for this team.
870827549621755909 2017-06-02 02:20:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Alyssa_Milano As a long-time admirer of yours, I wish I could hug you for how you're using your position and celebrity for good. 
870826209013190656 2017-06-02 02:15:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer @chrisgb00 @USCocksman I don't give Alex Jones any oxygen. I won't give this jackass any either....

870823876153884673 2017-06-02 02:06:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlecBaldwin (2/2)....that doesn't mean that what she did was acceptable, and it should be criticized/condemned as such. It crossed the line.
870823458342436864 2017-06-02 02:04:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlecBaldwin Mr. Baldwin, you are correct that only an idiot or a political opportunist would promote the idea that she was serious. However.... (1/2)

870815923908653057 2017-06-02 01:34:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UberFacts because Japanese pro baseball isn't the same. It's not really all that close. It's equivalent to AAA at best.
870815631347556352 2017-06-02 01:33:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 CLUTCH, CLUTCH, CLUTCH!!!!
870815430331342848 2017-06-02 01:32:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UberFacts All-time baseball hits leader....MLB is the only thing that really counts in this discussion. Japanese pro baseball doesn't count.
870815132820963328 2017-06-02 01:31:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasBaseball @OccupyLF Where are you guys? Posse?
870814863077003265 2017-06-02 01:30:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UberFacts Just stop. Pete Rose is the all-time hit leader. This is not credibly debatable....
870812524073017344 2017-06-02 01:20:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF wooooo-saaaahhhh......  wooooo-saaaahhhh.......
870812351599042560 2017-06-02 01:20:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot We'll see....
870812305344258048 2017-06-02 01:20:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UberFacts Well, considering Japan pro baseball is the equivalent of AAA, any Ichiro minor-league stats would by like including Pete's HS numbers.
870811559185981442 2017-06-02 01:17:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 Just breathe and get the next guy
870811198484127744 2017-06-02 01:15:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman What in the actual fuck......
870810157524983809 2017-06-02 01:11:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UberFacts So, will be go back and count all of Pete's minor league hits then?
870808670430388224 2017-06-02 01:05:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasBaseball @bboswell17 @joeywa_44 Clutch 7th inning for the 'Horns on the mound and at the plate.....
870808153612365824 2017-06-02 01:03:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Just pure clutch there.....
870804209410514944 2017-06-02 00:47:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 That is some CLUTCH pitching right there.....
870803896846786562 2017-06-02 00:46:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kbohls He and Ontiveros are close
870803538351226880 2017-06-02 00:45:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot It does make sense. A DH is more likely Sunday than tomorrow, because of FOX.
870802328109981696 2017-06-02 00:40:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot I doubt you'll get a DH tomorrow, but who knows?
870800193242841088 2017-06-02 00:31:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rangers @1053thefan @SandlerJ Had to do that multiple times when producing radio here in Austin during @TexasBaseball season, hehe....
870799676873691137 2017-06-02 00:29:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rangers @1053thefan @SandlerJ Ain't it great when you have to compose and build a sports radio talk show on the fly? 
870799045584760833 2017-06-02 00:27:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rangers @JeffHowe247 @Perroni247 The new one they're building will have a retractable one, thank God....
870797603805343745 2017-06-02 00:21:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GalGadot I'm guessing your 'followers' count is going to see a bit of a spike here very soon.....
870797068486328320 2017-06-02 00:19:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> I got to see @WonderWomanFilm last night. It was great!! @GalGadot was mesmerizing and angelic.
870796538221518849 2017-06-02 00:17:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @statesman Someone tell them to get over it
870789635894530048 2017-06-02 23:50:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UberFacts Um, he isn't baseball's all-time hit leader.
870780739561725952 2017-06-02 23:14:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Ask @WWMcClyde about it.....  I'll go get my popcorn.
870780499823808512 2017-06-02 23:13:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB I'm guessing the "Todd in LF, Jones at DH" move is for defense....

870379110681399296 2017-06-01 20:38:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal The people who have gained power & money through their destructive industries (fossil fuels) fear losing said power & money.
870377176499077120 2017-06-01 20:31:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal We, as a society, have allowed this attitude of willful ignorance and mocking of intelligence & education to fester and grow like a cancer.

870299246406139905 2017-06-01 15:21:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Andylanger That was some powerful stuff. I only listened...I didn't watch. Is that Tom Morello?
870161601923432448 2017-05-31 06:14:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil Btw, I agree that he's not a true closer. His best role is as an set-up man in the 8th.
870161395635036160 2017-05-31 06:13:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil Read this.... http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/just-a-bit-outside/story/sam-dyson-how-texas-rangers-turned-him-into-a-stud-reliever-100915  Then look at is 2015 & 2016 numbers with TEX.... http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dysonsa01.shtml  FAR more than serviceable.
870161162188369920 2017-05-31 06:12:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil He is more of a groundball than strikeout guy, true, but even his Ks went up after he got to Texas. Miami just wasn't using him correctly.
870160601988780032 2017-05-31 06:10:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil We got him for two minor-leaguers, so not nothing. Also, when he got here, Maddux & Bannister had him throw more sinkers, less sliders.
870159021403127808 2017-05-31 06:04:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil His velocity and movement are well above average. He's walking too many and not missing bats this year because his control has left him.
870158662513315840 2017-05-31 06:02:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil He throw a 96 MPH 4-seamer, a 95-96 MPH  2-seam sinker, & an upper 80s changeup that all have extreme movement, as well as a slider.
870157582131838976 2017-05-31 05:58:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil Sorry brother, but you're just wrong on this one. You might want to go back and look at his numbers with the Rangers before this season.
870155957342306304 2017-05-31 05:52:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil That is simply not true.
870129207665238016 2017-05-31 04:05:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tj_ford @BarkingCarnival If I'm picking I have to be logical & say Warriors in 6 or 7, but it obviously wouldn't surprise me if Cleveland won.
870128378984017920 2017-05-31 04:02:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil They care about losing a pitcher with excellent stuff, who is struggling right now, for nothing, which is what will happen. Bigger picture.
870127270127583233 2017-05-31 03:58:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SandlerJ @coopmavs @corbydavidson Right....my bad.
870126718761041920 2017-05-31 03:55:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil The Rangers obviously care, because this isn't a question of stuff. His stuff is still there, he just has lost his control.
870125687855693825 2017-05-31 03:51:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattmosley Already tried that....
870125597065748480 2017-05-31 03:51:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets That's pretty much what they did last month. It didn't help.....
870125133939200001 2017-05-31 03:49:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs oh right....duh. Then I definitely would have given him one more inning.
870124947196137472 2017-05-31 03:48:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets This is the only reason they haven't already DFA-ed him, IMO.
870124772503334913 2017-05-31 03:48:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @SandlerJ It would have made him unavailable tomorrow, but I would have seriously considered it.

870104804499914752 2017-05-31 02:28:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EWErickson Um, excuse me? What do you think "being good stewards of the planet" means then, exactly?
870068924817186816 2017-05-31 00:06:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kathygriffin @Alyssa_Milano @fergie824 I believe I made it quite clear that it wasn't ok
870055646942552065 2017-05-31 23:13:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @washingtonpost This is to be expected, but it also means nothing.
870055197120225281 2017-05-31 23:11:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kathygriffin @Alyssa_Milano @fergie824 I can show you many effigies of President Obama being lynched. That is in the same category.
870054464488579072 2017-05-31 23:08:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kathygriffin @Alyssa_Milano @fergie824 That is incorrect

869979000075976704 2017-05-31 18:08:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @everylastline @becasilverstein It's easier to have a conversation when both parties are typing/speaking coherently.

869973632226742273 2017-05-31 17:47:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I won't go quite that far, simply because I don't have the information the coaches and administration does. However, it does give me pause.
869972435134697473 2017-05-31 17:42:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kathygriffin @Alyssa_Milano @SuzanneFoubert Then you weren't paying attention. Similar things were done.

869758338770259968 2017-05-30 03:32:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde For me, it's not really her. She's fine. I just don't think that job is a necessary part of a broadcast for any game. It's a distraction.

869747065189945345 2017-05-30 02:47:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Interestingly enough, I think that performance helped earn him a higher draft position than most thought he would get.

869713129550172160 2017-05-30 00:32:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kathygriffin @WWMcClyde I agree. I found it tasteless, completely un-funny, and totally unacceptable....and I have expressed as much.

869704552903098368 2017-05-30 23:58:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @everylastline @surciuoli60 You're correct...we are. The biggest problem now though is, too many people on both sides don't remember that, and those in power exploit it
869697325769396225 2017-05-30 23:29:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @royalslounge @hmbtx @DMcComasOB Right.....of course.
869696912747773952 2017-05-30 23:27:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @royalslounge @hmbtx @DMcComasOB lol - that'll do until the fall, I expect.
869695146094338048 2017-05-30 23:20:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @royalslounge @hmbtx @DMcComasOB What about Kody, and what happen if Baker is back?
869693529316098048 2017-05-30 23:14:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @everylastline @rabble_rousing I disagree.....again.
869693448160411649 2017-05-30 23:14:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @everylastline @rabble_rousing I don't need to look at it again. I've watched it multiple times. I disagree with you.
869693039488507905 2017-05-30 23:12:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @hmbtx @DMcComasOB Then who takes over at 1B? I was discussing this during the WVU series out on @royalslounge. We weren't sure.

869691553253515264 2017-05-30 23:06:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @everylastline @rabble_rousing Also, calling out Kathy Griffin for this doesn't mean anyone is losing focus on the real issues/enemies. It's called compartmentalizing.
869691233081335808 2017-05-30 23:05:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith As you should be....
869691049979006977 2017-05-30 23:04:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I guess I view the start of the fight as the intentional 98 mph heater intentionally thrown at Harper's hip.
869690682197372928 2017-05-30 23:03:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @everylastline @rabble_rousing Maybe so, but that doesn't excuse it. Regardless, it's very poor satire done in very poor taste, and it's being correctly chastised.
869689399881211904 2017-05-30 22:58:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Strickland definitely is....

869668780082950144 2017-05-30 21:36:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DebraMessing Thank you Ms. Messing. I'm a big fan of your work and activism, and I'm very much looking forward to the new W&G episodes. :)

869666955959119872 2017-05-30 21:28:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Southernkiddo Another person who apparently can't handle being incorrect....she also blocked me. Just hilarious, snowflake-like behavior.....

869665433393258497 2017-05-30 21:22:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kathygriffin @Alyssa_Milano @squirellsRnutz LOL, this guy blocked me after I politely but directly told him he was incorrect and to do a little research on this. THAT is a snowflake.
869664512621850624 2017-05-30 21:19:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kathygriffin @Alyssa_Milano @BMillindaclub Ted Nugent....not the exact same thing, but similar.
869664228151635971 2017-05-30 21:18:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Southernkiddo Also, the 'you people' comment insinuates that I approve of this, which I have made it clear I do not.
869663976048742404 2017-05-30 21:17:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Southernkiddo I never made the claim that someone on the right did exactly that. I said "things like this". 'Like'...meaning similar or on the same level.
869662550836826112 2017-05-30 21:11:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Same here, even if it really was him just "selling Xanax to friends"....
869662282451693575 2017-05-30 21:10:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Southernkiddo I'll give you two Google searches to get you started: "President Obama lynching", and "Ted Nugent threatens President Obama". Have fun....

869659628145176576 2017-05-30 20:59:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kathygriffin @Alyssa_Milano @squirellsRnutz Not true....
869658447612129280 2017-05-30 20:55:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kathygriffin @Alyssa_Milano This wasn't acceptable when the right did crap like this directed at President Obama, and it isn't acceptable now.
869657975589412864 2017-05-30 20:53:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden This IS his 2nd chance....
869657918811066368 2017-05-30 20:52:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Because of their HUGE need at TE, I can begrudgingly understand the decision. However, if he goes afoul of the law once, he should be gone.
869656518811152384 2017-05-30 20:47:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall Oh I know & I think you're correct. That's annoys me so much. He could be a prominent, intelligent voice in sports, but he chooses not to be
869651936240431105 2017-05-30 20:29:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall Barstool is the sports website version of "Idiocracy". Clay Travis is actually very intelligent, but he prefers trolling to educating.

869288307041193986 2017-05-29 20:24:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @drstef @StephenAtHome @RogersWork No, I'm 43, but my point is...all he's doing is singing along with parts of the National Anthem.
869287316350787584 2017-05-29 20:20:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dcrysup In this current climate, when it comes threats to the US, I would actually agree with Sen. McCain.
869285908209700864 2017-05-29 20:14:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @drstef @StephenAtHome I loathe Trump, and I don't see the problem here....

Nevarez shouldn't have threatened him either.
869284034857357313 2017-05-29 20:07:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinHogan This is one of the reasons ESPN is struggling so mightily...
869280810188382212 2017-05-29 19:54:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MattRinaldiTX Should he have threatened you? No....  Should you have acted like an complete dick by calling ICE? No....  The lesson? Don't be a dick....
869279589457121280 2017-05-29 19:49:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WhitfordBradley @kurteichenwald They see it that way because our electorate has become increasingly ignorant & uninformed/misinformed with each passing election cycle.
869278772645724160 2017-05-29 19:46:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs You're right, unfortunately, because frank honesty gets treated like it's a micro-agression (I hate that term).

869019692438081537 2017-05-28 02:36:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @alex_kirshner @SBNationCFB Your conclusion that Zaire is somehow the one being punished if the SEC doesn't CHANGE a rule is very flawed logic.
869018672484024320 2017-05-28 02:32:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBNationCFB So if the SEC doesn't CHANGE their rule, it's punishing Zaire? Um, no....that's flawed logic. It would punish Florida who violated the rule.

868914178265935876 2017-05-28 19:37:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil Again, I think you're making something from nothing. The coverage/discussion of this story simply turned from the suspect to the victims.
868913479759147010 2017-05-28 19:34:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil It also came out that he was a lunatic and once he was in custody, the coverage turned to the victims, especially since one was a veteran.
868912926278787072 2017-05-28 19:32:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil You disagree based on what?
868912258935656448 2017-05-28 19:30:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil We actually have heard a lot about the victims. However, you haven't heard as much about him because he's in custody.
868911960234098688 2017-05-28 19:28:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil Who gives a shit who he supported, if he even really did (I doubt he did)? He is a racist lunatic who killed two people for no reason.

868864229054574594 2017-05-28 16:19:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump Whenever I see the phrase "Full of shit", but no one mentions a specific name....

868586442351661056 2017-05-27 21:55:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Well, Texas-TCU will have another game later on. Don't know what time....

868574090675859457 2017-05-27 21:06:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @WWMcClyde @srr50 From what I've read, Maryland fans don't like being in the Big 10. I think they want out.
868571406497349632 2017-05-27 20:55:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @WWMcClyde @srr50 My opinion: When granting of rights comes up, Maryland goes back to ACC (where they belong), Rutgers gets shown the door. Opens up 2 spots.
868570536040968192 2017-05-27 20:52:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters He just doesn't want to compete for a spot on a team. He wants one handed to him.
868569448126439425 2017-05-27 20:47:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @WWMcClyde However, a lot can change in 5 years. Still too early to discuss, honestly....
868568337600700416 2017-05-27 20:43:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @WWMcClyde Most likely scenario, IMO....UT, OU, OSU, & KU all end up in the Big 10. OU & OSU are joined at the hip. Big 10 would love Kansas for hoops.
868568001272000512 2017-05-27 20:42:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @WWMcClyde Precisely
868554303023312896 2017-05-27 19:47:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Man, usually a day off helps a baseball team. Monday's apparently shot the Rangers' wheels off.
868553511600091139 2017-05-27 19:44:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 He NEEDS to try and get some innings from him at this point.
868552959034085377 2017-05-27 19:42:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 Defense is letting Johnston down and he's making it worse with control problems.
868552810316562432 2017-05-27 19:41:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 They may score that a triple, but Todd should have caught that, without question.
868550214579351552 2017-05-27 19:31:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 The E4 cracked open the door and TCU kicked it in
868550002913796096 2017-05-27 19:30:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 Johnston can't find it....  He better settle down fast.
868549170902298624 2017-05-27 19:27:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 Pitch was off the plate, but up
868546464309538817 2017-05-27 19:16:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 And it immediately costs them a run. Also, Johnston is struggling early....
868545999127678976 2017-05-27 19:14:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joeywa_44 He let it play him

868536918102986753 2017-05-27 18:38:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde No, the Astros just wear jerseys that resemble that.
868535349596876801 2017-05-27 18:32:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Most were, especially the last 3.
868534288714792962 2017-05-27 18:28:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Can we agree that all of Lebron's finals teams, outisde of the 1st CLE team, were super teams heading into the playoffs?
868529676754587649 2017-05-27 18:09:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy All 3 of Lebron's titles have been as a member of a super team
868528734525173764 2017-05-27 18:06:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy These are both super teams
868528524960956416 2017-05-27 18:05:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Read my follow up....I mis-typed
868527368629039109 2017-05-27 18:00:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Between CLE/GS and the rest of the NBA, sorry....
868527244314071041 2017-05-27 18:00:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy There is a gap, but it's smaller than you're letting on. Also, the gap between CLE/GS is significant, so let's remember that.
868526482045489153 2017-05-27 17:57:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Yes, he is better overall.
868525383863476224 2017-05-27 17:52:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Magic has always been a much more apt comparison to me.
868523200317181952 2017-05-27 17:44:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Nah....but them again, I've never liked comparing the two. Bad comparison, IMO.
868274765785690113 2017-05-26 01:16:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @statesman @chucklindell That is one, very deluded way of looking at it, I guess....

868159992771293184 2017-05-26 17:40:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @netflix @BrockmireIFC @JBTexasEx @WWMcClyde It would be hard to think of something. Although, I would think "Veep" is close.

867964946180485120 2017-05-25 04:45:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal That too, but I read reports of 1/2-2/3 of the ballots cast were early-voting.
867964475957059586 2017-05-25 04:43:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal From what I read/was told, there were A LOT of early-voting ballots cast in MT before this whole thing happened. This dude got lucky.

867561034449657858 2017-05-24 02:00:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @WWMcClyde I think someone takes a flyer on him, especially since he's shown he can pitch too.
867560870989221888 2017-05-24 02:00:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @WWMcClyde I didn't say the possibility was huge, but there is one. He's a great defensive 1B & he's showed a lot of improvement at the plate this year
867559592653402113 2017-05-24 01:55:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball I would have played matchup. Claudio for Moreland, then probably Kela if Claudio got Moreland.

867101032588947456 2017-05-23 19:32:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @kujo6132 I meant to say distributors, not wholesalers.
867100588940636163 2017-05-23 19:31:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @kujo6132 There is no need. This is wholesalers basically lobbying and buying a law so that they get their cut of other people's work.

866752603010543617 2017-05-22 20:28:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @panerabread @jaymelamm Like any chain, it varies location to location. The one I visit in Austin from time to time is good.

866498665011085312 2017-05-21 03:39:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Btw, tonight's Dyson looked like last year's Dyson. Cross your fingers....
866498362169856000 2017-05-21 03:38:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I had no doubt you heard it from Nadel, but I hadn't, so I didn't know what was up.
866497585477017600 2017-05-21 03:34:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @seanhannity You really are a horrible human being
866497176670806016 2017-05-21 03:33:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Why is he unavailable? He didn't pitch yesterday.

866493181734551552 2017-05-21 03:17:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NRO Umm....that's why it's called a protest. Try to keep up.

866148667522248704 2017-05-20 04:28:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @timburg Do you know if it's easy for him now or not? He re-hydrated up to 157 tonight.
866146083067625472 2017-05-20 04:18:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I don't think anyone near his weight class can beat him. He wants to fight Manny, but Manny ain't that guy anymore. Crawford would whip him.
866145885801107456 2017-05-20 04:17:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @timburg @AJIsTheReal Problem is Crawford should be fighting at 147.....
866145615922831360 2017-05-20 04:16:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith 3 words..... Fuck. That. Bitch.
866095224006815744 2017-05-20 00:56:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith That wouldn't impress a woman living in Austin, much less LA....

865336147559550977 2017-05-18 22:39:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer He did, but it was announced he was transferring a good 6 weeks ago
865335929208270848 2017-05-18 22:38:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer Tevin Mack happened a good 6 weeks ago
865320141684436993 2017-05-18 21:36:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones I never watch Fox News anyway. This simply confirms my decision has been correct all along.....
865319069100236801 2017-05-18 21:31:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Sam_Vecenie The best response is none. Ignore it. It isn't worth the time or energy.
865309884191039490 2017-05-18 20:55:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN If he gets confirmed, it will be HIGHLY political and a pretty much straight party-line vote.
865289677334618112 2017-05-18 19:35:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm He didn't threaten her.
865289516659200000 2017-05-18 19:34:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @clarencehilljr @bso He acted like an ass towards her, but no....he did not threaten her.

865255324298694657 2017-05-18 17:18:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman I was hopeful, but not expecting this. When going head-to-head with UK, it's best to temper expectations as a fan.
865254092049965056 2017-05-18 17:13:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman Brother, you and I are on the same page about alot, but on this one.....#HookEm. ;)

865064269259444224 2017-05-17 04:39:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Oh of course, but you would have seen an entirely different country & history as well. I mean, it's hard to conceive the difference.

864991083180240896 2017-05-17 23:48:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @GTOphil Ok then.....just so you know, though, that's not how it came across.
864990673044471808 2017-05-17 23:47:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN Pretty much. I've seen Lindy pipe in on a few other twitter threads before. Ignore him. He's a waste of time.
864989190727061504 2017-05-17 23:41:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndrewCMcCarthy @NRO @RickyBird11811 Their lack of interest in it does not diminish the need for it to be said.
864988793035685888 2017-05-17 23:39:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @GTOphil You can be supportive of/believe in the office without supporting the person in it. The person in it is not worthy or deserving of support.
864987680639201284 2017-05-17 23:35:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @GTOphil You are? Where do you get the thinking that you're "supposed to"? That is, of course, dependent on how you define "support"....
864987269656190976 2017-05-17 23:33:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndrewCMcCarthy I'll say it again, @NRO....this man is soiling your brand.

864984515625832449 2017-05-17 23:22:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Interesting....  I can say with certainty that he is far from alone in that opinion.
864983985126072321 2017-05-17 23:20:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoguePOTUSStaff So, who was chosen to be suited up in body armor to protect themselves as they keep Trump's phone from him?
864983430530039809 2017-05-17 23:18:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheTweetOfGod @miguelevision I think there are WH staffers risking their lives right now, trying to prevent Trump from tweeting.
864983202032742402 2017-05-17 23:17:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde And neither will/should the House....
864982082153570313 2017-05-17 23:12:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil @WWMcClyde I think we all get what you mean, Phil, but McClyde is still correct in that those problems can't be solved with the cancer in the WH.
864979711063097344 2017-05-17 23:03:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN I hate abortion, but I think it needs to be legal.....for a list of reasons.
864979453662957568 2017-05-17 23:02:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onlxn @PoliticsWolf I've told people I think Ted Cruz is a greater threat to this country domestically than Trump. FYC....Pence is Cruz w/o the megalomania.
864978467938603008 2017-05-17 22:58:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @GTOphil I'm pro-life AND pro-choice.....seriously. Wrap your mind around that one.
864976354445545473 2017-05-17 22:50:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @jonswaine For what it's worth, he has resigned from that firm as of accepting this post as special counsel.
864975943185707008 2017-05-17 22:48:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil @SandlerJ While any improvement in his (lack of) plate discipline is good, I hope the glacial pace of that improvement picks up sooner, not later.

863224104559804416 2017-05-12 02:47:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @firemanrhea I would rather have had Gomez drop a safety squeeze there, like DD did later, than the contact play....but that's me.
863223665567072256 2017-05-12 02:45:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @firemanrhea I still wouldn't have done that in the 2nd inning. Difference of opinion....

863221472990547968 2017-05-12 02:36:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @firemanrhea @lonestarball The risk of running into an out at the plate and taking away a 2nd chance to drive in the run, which is exactly what happened.
863220513019240448 2017-05-12 02:33:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @firemanrhea @lonestarball Too early in the game for that type of risk, IMO.

863219071223025664 2017-05-12 02:27:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @firemanrhea Not in the 2nd inning with Gomez as the hitter....IMO.
863218901567639552 2017-05-12 02:26:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @firemanrhea @lonestarball But Gomez is a guy who could get the SF. Plus, I'm not running contact play in the 2nd inning.
863216631614459906 2017-05-12 02:17:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @firemanrhea @lonestarball Not necessarily, because you do have to take everything into account. Hitter, runner, pitcher,  IFs, etc....
863215869777903617 2017-05-12 02:14:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @firemanrhea @lonestarball A called straight-up contact play takes away the decision of the runner to read the play, IMO. Although, he should do that regardless.
863215283787509760 2017-05-12 02:12:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball I've always been curious why a catcher wouldn't use a 1B mitt....
863214818471419905 2017-05-12 02:10:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @firemanrhea Base-running mistakes, and no....in that case, a straight-up contact play was not a good idea if that was the case.
863199387534708736 2017-05-12 01:09:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde It shouldn't be a straight-up contact play in that situation
863199001360859136 2017-05-12 01:07:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball It's just that it's a continuation of a season-long theme....

862855386201829378 2017-05-11 02:22:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde You're right, he did. Everyone knew the plan was for JD to take over full control eventually, even Nolan.

862815488518258689 2017-05-11 23:43:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Yeah....Kevin was an "interesting" dude. Never truly got his head together, but never really came close in Arlington.
862814951471239169 2017-05-11 23:41:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde And TAG was a BIG reason why it was thin
862813633046351872 2017-05-11 23:36:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Two more: Edwin Corriea.....ugh.
862812571598041088 2017-05-11 23:32:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde During the late 80s & early 90s the Rangers had the talent to win the division & make the playoffs. I blame TAG & Bobby for the failures
862811982176628740 2017-05-11 23:29:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde LOL
862811730648420352 2017-05-11 23:28:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Oh yeah.....those two were essentially cajoined

862085714930012160 2017-05-09 23:23:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon Also, he supposedly did it to keep some NY office guys (conservatives who hate HRC) from going rogue. Your thoughts?
862084132737884161 2017-05-09 23:17:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd The reasons they chose to go with for his firing are what is so laughable here....

862081974663610368 2017-05-09 23:08:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd They started looking for a reason to fire him right after he testified before the Senate. Sessions was trying to find ways to justify it.

862022590952558592 2017-05-09 19:12:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @WWMcClyde McClyde is right on this one. The only way it's Gallo is if Daniels wants him to play every day in Triple A
862015852085956609 2017-05-09 18:46:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He and Gallo should go to a lefty-righty matchup at 1B
862013782616412160 2017-05-09 18:37:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil This line of thinking is one of the reasons their company is in its current state.
862013570728460289 2017-05-09 18:37:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm Why bother? His opinions are best left ignored so that he will hopefully disappear soon.
862008748772134913 2017-05-09 18:17:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ParkerMolloy @DAVEINYOURCAVE She owned both @tedcruz & @JohnCornyn. It was quite pleasurable.
862007996104269832 2017-05-09 18:14:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil Oh I'm all good. Bless that guy's heart. He tried so hard to make it seem like he has some dirt on UT, when all he did was look Aggy-esque.
862007010262482944 2017-05-09 18:11:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GTOphil The entire show concept is asinine, as is its predecessor 'First Take'. I have never, and will never, watch an episode.

861867124318507008 2017-05-09 08:55:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps He blocked, then unblocked me. I've given him multiple opportunities to present his alleged evidence, but he insults me instead....humorous.
861866670360604672 2017-05-09 08:53:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps I'm envious on the cigar....been a minute for me, but I did have a glass of Macallan 15 recently. Tasty....
861857390307758081 2017-05-09 08:16:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy I've read your timeline. There isn't an ounce of actual evidence to support your accusations. So....present it and/or report it.
861856963046629376 2017-05-09 08:14:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy You finally caught the pop culture reference....congratulations.
861855703027372032 2017-05-09 08:09:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy You keep using that word (proof). I don't think it means what you think it means.
861855553378807809 2017-05-09 08:09:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy And you'll still be someone who won't back up what they say when given the opportunity to do so, and instead hurls insults like a child.
861853969781542912 2017-05-09 08:02:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy I've presented you ample opportunity to back up what you say, and all you've done is insult & try to belittle me. You either can or can't.
861853531426496512 2017-05-09 08:01:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy Stop making accusations without evidence
861853403584090112 2017-05-09 08:00:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy No, you haven't. You've presented accusations with no real evidence to back them up, and when challenged on it, you've resorted to insults.
861852720315207680 2017-05-09 07:57:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy I'm not naive. I know that any major program could have at least a little dirt under its nails. This is major college football, after all.
861851271128592384 2017-05-09 07:52:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy Think of me more as a defense attorney. I don't have to prove anything since I'm not the one making the accusation. Burden of proof is yours
861850307520802816 2017-05-09 07:48:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy @JetSweeps This guy is nothing, if not entertaining....
861850075215122432 2017-05-09 07:47:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy OH!! You're going to start thinking now? ooooo.....this should be fun.pic.twitter.com/pqvJlECJHm
861849799217250305 2017-05-09 07:46:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy Prosecutors also show you cards that make you think they have a case, when in reality, it's a bluff.
861847596385665024 2017-05-09 07:37:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy As I suspected all along.....
861846646455513088 2017-05-09 07:33:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy Not that there's anything wrong with that.....
861846461486690304 2017-05-09 07:33:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy @JetSweeps This guy is fun. He's actually been one of the more entertaining ones.
861846112822538241 2017-05-09 07:31:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy Then please....enlighten us.
861845959021649921 2017-05-09 07:31:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy I'm a lesser human being for wanting you to back up your accusations? Interesting.... Is that how you view all those who disagree with you?
861843198997663745 2017-05-09 07:20:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> Butthurt fans who spew baseless accusations are so fun. The latest: @cfmalloy, an LSU fan accusing UT of payoffs after flipping Caden Sterns
861841221966344192 2017-05-09 07:12:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy A human being.
861840638203002880 2017-05-09 07:09:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy I've understood every word you've said. Every baseless charge, every dodge to every legitimate challenge....everything. Oh....still waiting.
861840053236060161 2017-05-09 07:07:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy You're correct, but you haven't presented any of that either.
861838713457922048 2017-05-09 07:02:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy Oh, I see....so you're claiming to be an expert then? Interesting....and your qualifications are?
861838146442584064 2017-05-09 07:00:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy Still waiting....
861837414377115648 2017-05-08 06:57:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cfmalloy You still have yet to present any.....thereby proving my point. You saying there are facts doesn't make it true unless you present them.

861814476462600192 2017-05-08 05:25:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy He also apparently blackmailed Conan O'Brien's hair stylist into making regular trips to DC....
861813066320760832 2017-05-08 05:20:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I thought I had a snappy retort for that, but my lack of hairline, grey facial hair, and expanding waistline said "Nope....you got nothin'."

861809229363118080 2017-05-08 05:05:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @miakhalifa I knew very little about hockey before the Stars move to Dallas in '92. I can totally identify with how you guys are feeling now.

861679470318583813 2017-05-08 20:29:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> Just a reminder that @tedcruz represents NO ONE but himself & his own political ambitions. Fellow Texans, he does not care ONE BIT about us.https://twitter.com/timkmak/status/861676628086329346

861675971174428673 2017-05-08 20:15:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman Ted Cruz accusing someone else of partisanship makes the irony of Draymond Green's statement on Kelly Olynyk look miniscule by comparison.

861671340637659137 2017-05-08 19:57:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JohnCornyn You're seriously using a hearing about Russian interference to ask Mrs. Yates about Trump's BS travel ban?? DO YOUR JOB!!!

861643496591151104 2017-05-08 18:06:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg If they bring in another vet and he beats that guy out? Fantastic....I just wasn't all that impressed with what I saw from him in 2015.

861422148304371713 2017-05-07 03:26:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Dantoni's teams play marginal team defense at best, which is why if they don't hit 3s, they lose. Look at the 2 WCF Phoenix teams he had.
861421409645600768 2017-05-07 03:24:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal This has been the main issue with all of Dantoni's teams.

860990626841710597 2017-05-06 22:52:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TannerL1994 No, it's not perfect, but it gets it right at a noticeably higher percentage than the umpires
860720693633331200 2017-05-05 04:59:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass Calling the zone as it is supposed to be called isn't squeezing pitchers.
860720161908719618 2017-05-05 04:57:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass And players were juiced....it was just as big a factor.
860719966248730625 2017-05-05 04:56:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass I didn't come to this position quickly or lightly, but the evidence has become overwhelming.
860719591831601153 2017-05-05 04:55:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass Watch the Real Sports story on this from last September. Umpires are getting worse, not better, at calling balls and strikes.
860719098459770880 2017-05-05 04:53:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass I'm thinking about it from a baseball perspective, as in the rules of the game. The strike zone is not supposed to be different for each ump
860718852228997122 2017-05-05 04:52:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass They'll adjust. I'm sick of umpires missing obvious strikes. They're getting worse, not better.
860718639556825088 2017-05-05 04:51:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass The only difference is adjustments for the size of the batter.
860718522254733312 2017-05-05 04:51:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass The strike zone IS uniform....or at least it's supposed to be.
860718182721609728 2017-05-05 04:49:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass If a pitch doesn't touch the zone, the pitcher shouldn't get the call.
860717975296454656 2017-05-05 04:48:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass A strike should be a strike, period. The strike zone shouldn't change game to game, inning to inning....which it currently does.
860717317109534721 2017-05-05 04:46:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @SeanCBass Framing shouldn't even be a thing....take balls and strikes away from umpires.

860322586047242245 2017-05-04 02:37:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @CoreyElliot Not really. We're just saying neither team has done enough to warrant being "big brother"

860308604771086336 2017-05-04 01:42:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @CoreyElliot Actually, if we're being accurate, the answer is: The AL pennant

859951590064738304 2017-05-03 02:03:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall I totally understand you feeling that way and believe there is no justification for the actions that have caused it to happen.
859949628334235648 2017-05-03 01:55:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall Good thing is, we're arguing semantics. We're on the same side here.
859948695260995586 2017-05-03 01:52:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones Ironically funny.....
859947974645907457 2017-05-03 01:49:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall My point was, it's not hatred so much as indifference.....but some people do view that as a form of hatred.
859947473359470592 2017-05-03 01:47:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Notice I didn't comment on the degree to which they've moved, hehehe....

859946883669790720 2017-05-03 01:44:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Looking in the right places is most definitely part of the search, and it's an error-filled process, no doubt.

859943886730530818 2017-05-03 01:32:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall This is all about money, and letting insurance companies keep/charge more, so they can cut taxes for the rich and increase their own coffers
859943596438499329 2017-05-03 01:31:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall They're simply falling back in lock-step with exactly what insurance comapnies had/want listed as "pre-existing conditions".
859940280920944640 2017-05-03 01:18:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AndeWall Hate? Probably not....  Don't care at all about their needs? Definitely.....

859570780123934724 2017-05-02 00:50:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Which still could happen while you sleep....  Do you have something to ward off cats?

859564375081984004 2017-05-02 00:24:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde You should be able to do that without sending him down
859538195507183618 2017-05-02 22:40:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I don't even think I could get mad about that. If I was on the other side, I think would have laughed and just said "Fuck you"

859535995087331328 2017-05-02 22:32:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I can totally believe that
859535493805068290 2017-05-02 22:30:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde No, it's fine. They're far from the only ones who do it.
859535250275348481 2017-05-02 22:29:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde So it's basically just a jock-sniffing session?

859488067559849985 2017-05-02 19:21:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde The DNC and Hillary have to own their own mistakes, which were many, but we're way beyond "may have been" at this point.
859471529939218432 2017-05-02 18:15:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @WWMcClyde Banny, IMO, struggled with bullpen management last year as well after having ti shift guys around due to Tolleson shitting the bed.
859468947904770050 2017-05-02 18:05:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo @AlbertBreer The correct response after "saying it has been" should be "the Red Sox & Fenway security must put a stop to it immediately!!"

859248983725809664 2017-05-01 03:31:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I don't think DiMaggio's record will ever fall.
859232206899859456 2017-05-01 02:24:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I would say the defense deserves a good chunk of the blame.
859231443196809216 2017-05-01 02:21:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Another leadoff walk, a silly error, and three balls that haven't been hit hard enough to break glass....
859231258857152512 2017-05-01 02:21:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant If he could have gotten rid of that ball immediately, he might have gotten Bregman
859227486919544837 2017-05-01 02:06:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot @USCocksman Best way to approach it, for sure....
859226924618567682 2017-05-01 02:03:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot @USCocksman Normally, I would totally agree, but there's no way those core guys aren't thinking about last year.

859225029418127360 2017-05-01 01:56:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman @CoreyElliot Right now it's a question of 'Are the Rangers in the Astros' heads?', and at the moment it seems like the answer is 'Yes'.
859224206411796480 2017-05-01 01:53:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot As I told @USCocksman earlier....if the Astros can't get the Rangers right now, you should worry, because the Rangers are scuffling.

859210243968036868 2017-05-01 00:57:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal And it took a recent got streak to get him to .240 at that....

859125347408896002 2017-05-01 19:20:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Very true.... The accumulation of Kardashians far outweighs Paris Hilton

858738576607064065 2017-04-30 17:43:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy It's the panhandle....weather there is more schizo than anywhere else in Texas.
858730618968059904 2017-04-30 17:11:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasBaseball @WWMcClyde I believe the current rule is, you have 72 hrs from the start of Game 1 to finish the series.
858729921362972673 2017-04-30 17:09:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasBaseball @WWMcClyde Just let them stay in Stillwater for another 24 hours to see if they can get it in.
858729559432323075 2017-04-30 17:07:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasBaseball @WWMcClyde Bottom line, the rule should be changed to allow for 4 days to play 3 game, IMO.
858729202786422786 2017-04-30 17:06:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasBaseball @WWMcClyde It does. The cancelled game would most likely prevent a tie, leaving OSU or Texas either 1/2 game ahead or behind someone.
858728060492840962 2017-04-30 17:01:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasBaseball @WWMcClyde Well, in this case, Texas already won the series, but it could put either team 1/2 game behind another team that they beat this year.
858726871877472257 2017-04-30 16:56:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasBaseball They need to change these rules to give teams a better chance to get this conference games in.
858710594081476608 2017-04-30 15:52:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo I think it was just a bet that he would win, but still....
858568324296445952 2017-04-29 06:26:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @nytimes @seankent You, and everyone else doing this, need a serious kick in the ass.
858567791376510976 2017-04-29 06:24:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith I have whiskey, tequila, and vodka.....which one? All three?
858545959294337024 2017-04-29 04:58:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanCBass Why wouldn't she be?
858492603137961985 2017-04-29 01:26:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He showed serious grit and heart against a shit strike zone & Angels hitters laying off tough pitches.
858486643602403329 2017-04-29 01:02:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tweetgrubes Well, the strike zone has been bullshit, and he then he thought Chavez balked. Also, Pujols started talking shit....
858486199148826624 2017-04-29 01:00:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Turned on that sucker!!
858479145214455808 2017-04-29 00:32:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Seriously, I'm about done with umpires calling balls & strikes.
858478347294302209 2017-04-29 00:29:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde What makes it worse is, he's been getting squeezed in this game
858477779121303553 2017-04-29 00:27:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Yeah, I know
858477177884598273 2017-04-29 00:24:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I'm almost fully on-board with taking away balls & strikes from umpires and giving it to the computers.
858475614227005440 2017-04-29 00:18:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde True....I just don't think he ever will be.
858475071857463296 2017-04-29 00:16:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball Which is strange considering that's been one of his strengths....
858474847999021058 2017-04-29 00:15:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He's just never going to be a consistently  economical pitcher
858474183835234304 2017-04-29 00:12:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tweetgrubes With his pitch count, he won't go past 7.
858473930595684352 2017-04-29 00:11:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @mikefreemanNFL They're not clueless, it's just that their care factor is inversely proportional to the level of value of a pick/player.
858471853970644993 2017-04-29 00:03:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @POTUS @Jeff_Caplan Personally, I think the media should have refused to cover it
858471644402245632 2017-04-29 00:02:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @POTUS @Jeff_Caplan But yes, that rally was created as nothing but a big "F you" to the media....

858185920771751936 2017-04-28 05:07:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymohr37 They reached a mutual settlement that she was obviously ok with. If she's good with it, everyone else should be as well.

858175168581177344 2017-04-28 04:24:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Yeah, because the Bengals have such a great track record of dealing with problem athletes...  Oh, wait....

857772449794064384 2017-04-27 01:44:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @HoustonTexans gave up their 1st & 2nd-rd picks next year to the @Browns in order to swap out Osweiller for Watson. Think about that.
857771590913847296 2017-04-27 01:40:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JasonMinnix Not worth giving up next year's 1st-round pick....
857770842759069698 2017-04-27 01:38:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Giving up next year's 1st-round pick?? Ridiculous!! Houston is almost single-handedly rebuilding the Browns franchise.

856725326063390720 2017-04-24 04:23:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport @SandlerJ Bottom line is, Marquez had a loose zone for MIN pitchers and a tight one for TEX pitchers. It directly contributed to the loss.

856723892135763969 2017-04-24 04:17:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport @SandlerJ He threw strikes to all 3 guys that were called balls.
856718310339215360 2017-04-24 03:55:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> Oh I can think of a few worse things off the top of my head.....https://twitter.com/CoreyStewartVA/status/856699414907367424
856717071983538176 2017-04-24 03:50:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Marquez should either be suspended or sent down.
856715425614311424 2017-04-24 03:44:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman @JGrill @UKAllday1919 He didn't call out Fox News for not "carrying his water". That is an incorrect characterization.
856709119067160576 2017-04-24 03:19:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Makes me ill to agree with him, but yeah....
856708982802657280 2017-04-24 03:18:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin I'm quite curious as to what the issue is as well....
856708407503572993 2017-04-24 03:16:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak Just below, but yes...too much of the plate
856708213118468096 2017-04-24 03:15:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman @JGrill @UKAllday1919 His thin skin? Really? Provide examples, please
856707464615657472 2017-04-24 03:12:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak That pitch was below the knees, diving down. Not fat at all....
856707209220194304 2017-04-24 03:11:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanCBass You mean the Alfonso Marquez breakdown?
856706989904343041 2017-04-24 03:10:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Alfonso Marquez is as big a reason as any other that Texas lost this game.
856705765855375361 2017-04-24 03:05:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball One strike zone for one team....another for the other team. Unreal....  Then he tosses Banni for nothing....
856703888833032194 2017-04-24 02:58:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MikeLeslieWFAA What is the issue here between the board and the coach?
856698448464269314 2017-04-24 02:36:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UKAllday1919 @rexchapman @JGrill Explain that comment, please.....
856697210997792772 2017-04-24 02:31:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UKAllday1919 @rexchapman @JGrill I didn't say or insinuate the numbers you tweeted were made up
856696920156381185 2017-04-24 02:30:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UKAllday1919 @rexchapman @JGrill I have no idea what you know or don't know. I was speaking about the general attitude towards the topic.
856696309658550273 2017-04-24 02:28:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UKAllday1919 @rexchapman @JGrill I don't like him as a leader because he's never shown himself to be an effective one, and is still showing he isn't.
856694473614651392 2017-04-24 02:20:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UKAllday1919 @rexchapman @JGrill I'm done arguing about the ACA, because the amount of misinformation out there about it is mountainous and those against it refuse to listen

856679554747858944 2017-04-24 01:21:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr What's the issue here between the coach and the school board?
856676553215922176 2017-04-24 01:09:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman @UKAllday1919 @JGrill No, they put themselves in those situations. In Trump's case, however, it's worse. He made outlandish promises for shits & giggles.
856662252656656386 2017-04-24 00:12:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman @JGrill @UKAllday1919 Many doctors did know and were telling their patients

856660119752495104 2017-04-24 00:04:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman @UKAllday1919 @JGrill So, you're saying the idiocy of making a ridiculously and obviously unrealistic campaign promise that gullible morons bought into.... (1/2)
856644754775433216 2017-04-24 23:03:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JenksCSN Please tell me you've had a chance to watch @BrockmireIFC.....
856643275113070592 2017-04-24 22:57:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> (2/2) The language isn't kid-friendly & definitely NSFW, but it is WELL worth your time, especially if you love baseball. You can stream it.
856642214881054720 2017-04-24 22:53:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> PSA for all of my friends & family who love great comedy...especially baseball fans: If you have @IFC, you NEED to watch @BrockmireIFC (1/2)
856631881890238465 2017-04-24 22:12:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy This is my concern as well. It has started with such a comedic fury that I worry about its stamina.
856631147501113344 2017-04-24 22:09:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy It's spectacular. Oh, and Amanda Peet? She's still got it.....
856625743798947840 2017-04-24 21:47:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman @JGrill But people were aware, before the law went into effect, which plans would be discontinued for non-compliance and which doctors would opt out
856618433747800066 2017-04-24 21:18:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @theoldgreywolf @TexasPharmD @onestrikeaway @corbydavidson I'm guessing he means the 3 best numbers to look at, regardless of if it's a stat or a sabremetric number.
856612415005499392 2017-04-24 20:54:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman @JGrill Do you remember that that actually occurrd BEFORE President Obama ran for re-election, and then he won anyway?

854553067085332481 2017-04-18 04:31:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway LeClerc, Jeffress, and maybe Kela are more legitimate options that could be argued there. Bush isn't. Not in the 6th....

854550631314595840 2017-04-18 04:22:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway No, a position he's been been put in for the time being. It's not arbitrary. He is, as of now, the primary closer.
854550335976869890 2017-04-18 04:20:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway LeClerc? Ok....definitely an option, but not Bush.
854550190388383744 2017-04-18 04:20:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Well, Bush wasn't a serious option there given the position he's in now.

854549183256285193 2017-04-18 04:16:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway So, you use Kela or Jeffress in the 6th?
854548949981679616 2017-04-18 04:15:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Who do you go get then, still in the 6th?
854548393720459264 2017-04-18 04:13:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Yu, pretty clearly, had lost command in that inning. He had thrown 26 pitches to get one out in the 6th.
854547559720923136 2017-04-18 04:09:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Not if you think he's lost his command....
854546164020105216 2017-04-18 04:04:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @lonestarball I really think it's simply that Yu lost his command.
854545801086992384 2017-04-18 04:02:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @WWMcClyde I would have given him one more batter to find it again
854544236997423105 2017-04-18 03:56:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I would have given him one more batter to see if he could find his command
854544008495984640 2017-04-18 03:55:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @WWMcClyde He simply lost his command in this inning. 2 BBs and the 3 balls put in play were smoked.
854541956684406784 2017-04-18 03:47:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers Lost command this inning....

854154586252349440 2017-04-17 02:08:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean For the life of me, I cannot comprehend how someone who considers themselves to be a strong person of faith can support that man.
854125399676248064 2017-04-17 00:12:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser I love that he's being forced to admit that he's a total fraud because his ex is suing him for custody.

854011237939781632 2017-04-17 16:38:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I have the 1st 2 episodes (its premiere night) on the DVR. Missed recording 3rd one. Haven't watched yet, but was anticipating this show....
853783191177633792 2017-04-16 01:32:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @RangersFan8776 Tolleson has a back injury right now, so no
853782674976247808 2017-04-16 01:30:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @RangersFan8776 Btw, Tolleson is with the Rays currently
853782595838103553 2017-04-16 01:30:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @RangersFan8776 Last year when they DFA-ed him
853782490049368065 2017-04-16 01:29:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @RangersFan8776 It was actually last year, and regardless, Dyson has noticeably better stuff than Tolleson.
853781202599391233 2017-04-16 01:24:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @RangersFan8776 You are 100% wrong
853579209020669952 2017-04-16 12:01:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bradbainum @JimPressOffice It's really not a big difference, but regardless....it's one of the most stupid and backward-thinking things I've heard in a LONG time.

853399722647846912 2017-04-15 00:08:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC_Hoops @Bitterwhiteguy Depends on which Fletcher's stand and when.....

853326275280285697 2017-04-15 19:16:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson Yes, if for no other reason, because Sam has had no snaps with the 1s

852039116858445824 2017-04-11 06:02:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PatDStat @GregRajan That's not the vibe your entire sports dept is presenting. Bashing a team for honoring one of the great athletes in their city? Petty....
852035800866762752 2017-04-11 05:48:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PatDStat @GregRajan Also, it's the last spot (not even that, really) on the bench in the home finale for a lottery team. Whose spot, exactly, is he "stealing"?
852035357965144066 2017-04-11 05:47:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PatDStat @GregRajan Would you care if it was any other team/city other than Dallas? I seriously doubt it....
852028517227220993 2017-04-11 05:20:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @WWMcClyde Just saying the guy behind him has never been dangerous.
852028119888183296 2017-04-11 05:18:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @WWMcClyde With Simmons behind him? Yes. He's still a HOF hitter.
852027753184362498 2017-04-11 05:17:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Should have walked Albert.....period.
852026982086746112 2017-04-11 05:13:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant His stuff was better tonight, but every pitch he missed with in/near the zone got put in play for a hit.
852026301649043459 2017-04-11 05:11:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanCBass @onestrikeaway The problem was he went there 3 straight pitches
852026121411416065 2017-04-11 05:10:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Yes....should have elevated

852024998030057474 2017-04-11 05:06:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway The pitch to Escobar wasn't either, but he missed enough.....

851647136404000769 2017-04-10 04:04:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny Bottom line is, you're making it sound completely trivial (without pertinent details) when someone lost their livelihood.
851646736359727105 2017-04-10 04:02:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny It also reads like it could have been something that the board is just covering their asses over. Without more details, we don't know.
851645565716893696 2017-04-10 03:58:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny I'm not being dense. It's a situation in which someone lost their job. A little more serious than you're giving it credit for.....
851642794854821888 2017-04-10 03:47:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny So you think he should quit because he disagrees with the board's decision? Why?
851641854718332928 2017-04-10 03:43:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny My point is, he doesn't need the money. He's coaching because he loves it. He's not going to abandon the kids in his program over this.
851640638508605440 2017-04-10 03:38:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny You think he's doing that job because he needs the money?

851607273575256064 2017-04-10 01:26:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean @towershots Definitely. They were demanding people give up their seats for stand-by United employees who had a flight this morning. Eff that...that's BS
851605000186986496 2017-04-10 01:17:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean @towershots The reason I disagree is because this was not a security issue. This was a "United screwed up" issue, but you're right on the last part.

849813719391637504 2017-04-05 02:39:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @WWMcClyde Done. I do not reply to that typically. That was my fault for poor observation.
849813431280599040 2017-04-05 02:38:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @WWMcClyde However, I did not see the date. That's my fault for not noticing.....my bad.

849812094266507264 2017-04-05 02:32:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MaxAbrahms @Ian_A_Boyd I didn't say that it was. However, it also isn't determined, especially as a country, by how much it directly affects us.
849807158472572928 2017-04-05 02:13:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MaxAbrahms @Ian_A_Boyd And in this case, I think the majority of people would consider you callous for choosing that in the face of what has occurred.
849806478022193152 2017-04-05 02:10:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MaxAbrahms @Ian_A_Boyd That depends on the situation you face in which you choose inaction.
849805238508892160 2017-04-05 02:05:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MaxAbrahms @Ian_A_Boyd More humility? Sure.....but inaction doesn't equate to humility. It actually equates more to lack of empathy and apathy.
849803239059017728 2017-04-05 01:57:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MaxAbrahms @Ian_A_Boyd Then we cede our position in the world w/ that choice. Look, there's no solution that doesn't have a big downside, including doing nothing.

849634863384854528 2017-04-05 14:48:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Ok....gotcha. I thought it was more about pushing out far left/right.

849633828297744385 2017-04-05 14:44:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy My point is, she is considered more of a "voice of the left" than him, which makes her more of a left equivalent to Hannity/O'Reilly
849632754744602625 2017-04-05 14:40:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Switch out Matthews for Maddow, and I'd be 100% down with this. She's far more left than Matthews.

849311848621068288 2017-04-04 17:24:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy She has a point about Tony getting the gig on the top CBS crew, but he's more eloquent now than Phil ever has been.
849311386756952064 2017-04-04 17:23:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BonnieBernstein @kenrudin There's no need to hate Phil, but he was average, at best.
849114439978758149 2017-04-03 04:20:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> Get you Shaggy on.... "It wasn't me...."

849109950127378432 2017-04-03 04:02:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @andrewperloff A close, back-and-forth game can't always overcome ugly & over-officiated
849097630718230528 2017-04-03 03:13:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> Some of these calls are legit, some borderline, some terrible, but the refs totally taking over is a bad look @NCAA #nationalchampionship
849095270705106949 2017-04-03 03:04:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving @spshoot Well, no one is executing #3 anyway.....
849093364586876929 2017-04-03 02:56:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ByronTau This is who @SenJohnMcCain has become. "I disgree with this action"....  Supports/votes for it anyway....
849087137509253121 2017-04-03 02:32:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MacEngelProf Ok then.....
849086614257242117 2017-04-03 02:29:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MacEngelProf @WWMcClyde @jakek34 And it may come to that, but to call for it during the season opener is pure clickbait

848965063797088256 2017-04-03 18:26:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN It's the fault of both, but let's not act like the blame is equal on both sides, either.

848919722087337985 2017-04-03 15:26:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN Then what is your definition of 'fine'? According to mine, I know many who were spanked and are not only fine, but are doing quite well.
848912216040591363 2017-04-03 14:56:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy We'll see how it plays out. I've also seen many projections with him not being a lottery pick.
848911861118636035 2017-04-03 14:55:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I think "likely" is a stretch in this draft
848911207289540608 2017-04-03 14:52:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Yeah, but it's less loaded overall. He's a lottery pick next year, IMO.
848910686533152768 2017-04-03 14:50:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Tasteful, yet risqu.....
848910150996029441 2017-04-03 14:48:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Ok, and yeah....this draft is LOADED. But in that case....no, he didn't make a bad choice.
848909577085210626 2017-04-03 14:46:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy In your opinion, had he stayed, would he have been a 1st-round pick in this draft?
848725015054995456 2017-04-02 02:33:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWENetwork I have now given up trying to watch #Wrestlemania live because of your amatuer-level bandwidth & feed. #DissatisfiedCustomer

848370203176075264 2017-04-01 03:03:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DVNJr @WWMcClyde He should still be criticized for uttering such stupidity on national TV
848368672112553985 2017-04-01 02:57:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LukeRussert @mbradleyrn I actually agree that the athletes should be paid, but UNC didn't even give those kids the compensation that was required of them.

848367947668172801 2017-04-01 02:54:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @DVNJr That is an absolutely ludicrous statement by Nantz. I hope he gets SOUNDLY ripped for that BS.....
848366442512871424 2017-04-01 02:48:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LukeRussert I have a problem with it, because UNC basically skirted giving those kids the college education they owed to them.
848356253097177088 2017-04-01 02:07:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo I love the fact that @TripleH views tag-team wrestling as an asset & pushes it on @WWENXT. Too bad @VinceMcMahon doesn't see it the same way
848347861700018177 2017-04-01 01:34:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WSJ The answer is yes. It should be against the law.
848338320312733696 2017-04-01 00:56:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @OccupyLF @bkaucher ok, it looked real close that maybe he didn't, but the ump didn't make that call anyway.
848331054306000900 2017-04-01 00:27:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lawhorn06 @WWMcClyde I said a chance. I didn't say what size that chance was.
848324100485505025 2017-04-01 00:00:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @lawhorn06 As of now, the only D with a chance of un-seating him is Castro.

846525496087269376 2017-03-27 00:53:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> This is completely unsurprising, but there's nothing one can really disagree with here.https://twitter.com/mikefreemanNFL/status/846482000542347265
846512748301336576 2017-03-27 00:02:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr He is a loud-mouthed braggard, but....at least for now....he's harmless.
846512204836999168 2017-03-27 00:00:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I don't necessarily care who the voice for oppo is as long as they don't say stupid things. This is stupid.
846505134591000576 2017-03-27 23:32:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde It's just a silly statement to make, period.
846504567298777088 2017-03-27 23:29:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Agreed.....calling Garland a "consensus nominee" is just simply inaccurate.
846504107594715137 2017-03-27 23:28:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachTomHerman Hey, @StewMyrick....check out the strap.
846503904984608768 2017-03-27 23:27:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde It's not really old school, but I love the Carolina Mudcats hat.

846483849215459328 2017-03-27 22:07:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde That is tight....
846482540127014912 2017-03-27 22:02:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Very true. I was just thinking about guys who had the athleticism to be an All-Star in multiple team sports.
846481793884852225 2017-03-27 21:59:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He and Deion Sanders....

845098857973399553 2017-03-23 02:24:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim Good night, gentlemen
845098252202598400 2017-03-23 02:21:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim Would you prefer the word "predominantly"? Is that better?
845098071839195137 2017-03-23 02:20:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim How many times do I have to say it before you comprehend it? It was MOSTLY white people that were upset
845097620410437632 2017-03-23 02:19:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim I have nothing to prove, because I never made the declarations you've tried to assign to me.
845097130586976256 2017-03-23 02:17:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim ok, keep telling yourself that
845097029206528000 2017-03-23 02:16:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim Now you're changing your parameters.
845096507791544320 2017-03-23 02:14:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim I'm not deflecting anything, but keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better.
845096302606209026 2017-03-23 02:13:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO Robert, just stop....  My statement has not changed, and it's not even one you disagree with
845095949777154049 2017-03-23 02:12:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim You are claiming that it's only white people who were upset by the anthem protest.
845095490228305920 2017-03-23 02:10:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO I'm not doing that, Robert, but he asked for an example. I gave him one.
845095212934418432 2017-03-23 02:09:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim You're simply not listening....
845095013075836930 2017-03-23 02:08:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim Btw, you can't prove your statement either, so stop acting like you can.
845094894720962561 2017-03-23 02:08:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim I'll give you a media member example.....Sage Steele.
845094740009865216 2017-03-23 02:07:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim Good for your family. I happen to agree with them. Not all military families did, though....
845094423054749696 2017-03-23 02:06:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim I'll say it again....hopefully you'll read it....it was MOSTLY white people, but not EXCLUSIVELY
845094101380993024 2017-03-23 02:05:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim Well, if you want an example of a group where non-whites were upset by what he did, ok....military families.
845093827971072000 2017-03-23 02:04:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim Saying that implies that it was only white people that were upset by it
845093441063260161 2017-03-23 02:02:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim So, you're proof is the mentions on his Twitter timeline? Ok then....
845093209932025859 2017-03-23 02:01:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim I said, multiple times, that it was MOSTLY white people that were upset, just not EXCLUSIVELY.
845093032374489089 2017-03-23 02:00:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim So you're saying you can prove it was exclusively only white people that were upset? ok, feel free....
845092636176404480 2017-03-23 01:59:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim No, and I never said I could. Nor did I say LARGE amounts of non-whites were upset. Don't put words in my mouth
845092424657616896 2017-03-23 01:58:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim All I said was it wasn't exclusively white people that were bothered by the anthem protest.
845092035212300289 2017-03-23 01:56:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim I never mentioned any groups of any kind.
845091716503928833 2017-03-23 01:55:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim ok man.....
845090254491209728 2017-03-23 01:49:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd They've missed a TON
845090078640754688 2017-03-23 01:49:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @SeanG1911 Exactly. He is a backup/developmental QB right now, and one that isn't an automatic fit in every system
845088472721510401 2017-03-23 01:42:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markschlereth @BSO I believe Kaep will get a job at some point, but the "outrage" over him not having one right now is silly.
845087941580001280 2017-03-23 01:40:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @Kusheim Again....mostly, but not exclusively.
845087649530568704 2017-03-23 01:39:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd Not really....he just put it out there. Didn't extend it....
845087399747178502 2017-03-23 01:38:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd That was a flop
845087206037446656 2017-03-23 01:37:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO @TheRealDaetwan To those who have a real problem with it, kneeling for the anthem is viewed as disrespectful, regardless of the reason.
845086815124160513 2017-03-23 01:36:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO Mostly, but not exclusively.....
845086092021911552 2017-03-23 01:33:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BSO I agree, but the anthem issue was/is a negative thing for a LARGE portion of the country, whether you agree with that or not.
845085200958832641 2017-03-23 01:29:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markschlereth @BSO Tebow's baggage was less "negative" than Kaep's, but it was still there. The NFL has low tolerance for that from backups
845084795344486401 2017-03-23 01:28:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markschlereth @BSO It's not a racial issue. It's a "Does talent outweigh baggage?" issue. Kaep is much like Tebow. Baggage outweighs talent
845068618828263425 2017-03-23 00:23:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde *Succinctly......dammit.

845032384852611073 2017-03-23 21:59:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots Literally....one of the worst songs ever. And I actually like Fergie. She's a nice person.

845001340019490816 2017-03-23 19:56:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @corbydavidson well, if you're here for the night....beverages & basketball somewhere after? I'll can check music listings too....
844995664090140672 2017-03-23 19:34:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @corbydavidson Doing the show at Austin CC?
844995432963096576 2017-03-23 19:33:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @corbydavidson Are you here for the weekend?
844973659248889859 2017-03-23 18:06:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HelmetBoy_Texas I'm not so sure they're willing to go there, but we'll see.
844972103745064960 2017-03-23 18:00:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HelmetBoy_Texas Really? And why do you think that?
844970969034899456 2017-03-23 17:55:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jpodhoretz @HelmetBoy_Texas They are filibustering him on principle, and I'm fine with that. The behavior of the GOP cannot be rewarded.
844969954889879553 2017-03-23 17:51:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsBuffet1 This can't be real....
844967535103660033 2017-03-23 17:42:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdgeofSports @justinwells2424 And to be a backup/developmental QB in the NFL, your talent has to outweigh your baggage.
844966891105996800 2017-03-23 17:39:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EdgeofSports @justinwells2424 He showed improvement last year, for sure, but he's not good enough for someone to bring him in as a starter.
844965778638213125 2017-03-23 17:35:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 @EdgeofSports He also only completed 59.2% of his passes, and has a career comp% of 59.8
844818881638088705 2017-03-23 07:51:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @ovegarcia1 @dashmya I'm correct according the definition of what terrorism is.
844818436840566784 2017-03-23 07:49:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KhaledBeydoun @MtOreadKaws Good for us, that's not how things are measured. He's still far out-pacing you. Try harder....
844817040019894272 2017-03-23 07:44:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @ovegarcia1 @dashmya One last time...all acts of terrorism are hate crimes, but not all hate crimes are acts of terrorism.
844815489922621440 2017-03-23 07:38:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @dashmya And with that, I bid you good night, sir.....
844815381348827136 2017-03-23 07:37:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @dashmya As I said before, not all hate crimes are acts of terrorism.
844815172027895810 2017-03-23 07:36:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @dashmya And to answer this particular question.....no, not necessarily.
844814822034202628 2017-03-23 07:35:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @dashmya This has nothing to do with race. It's about the motivation and reasons behind a particular act.
844814351202607105 2017-03-23 07:33:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @dashmya Would you call Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer terrorists?
844813435716038656 2017-03-23 07:29:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @dashmya That's too generic of a question to answer
844813119322972160 2017-03-23 07:28:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RockChalkPhog25 @KhaledBeydoun @MtOreadKaws Why don't you go there and find out....
844811942187319296 2017-03-23 07:23:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @dashmya In the NYC case, that man was just lashing out due to his hatred of black men. He had no over-reaching goal, otherwise.
844811774675206144 2017-03-23 07:23:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @dashmya Not if the person that commits it isn't trying to achieve a political or ideological goal. That's what separates the two
844810751550275585 2017-03-23 07:19:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing @dashmya It actually clarifies that the one in New York wasn't. That's been my point all along
844810375069544450 2017-03-23 07:17:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @dashmya To put it in simpler terms...an act of terrorism is always a hate crime, but not all hate crimes are acts of terrorism.
844809532819718145 2017-03-23 07:14:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing @dashmya Although, in that case, his actions were much closer to an act of domestic terrorism than in this one.
844809096184311809 2017-03-23 07:12:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing @dashmya Yes....precisely.
844807560389582850 2017-03-23 07:06:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing @dashmya Feel free to look up the definition of "terrorism". Then, you'll know why.
844806136494641153 2017-03-23 07:00:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing @dashmya It's a hate crime, but not terrorism
844776564298412032 2017-03-22 05:03:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival I love it.....
844775121915068416 2017-03-22 04:57:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Burn 'em up all night long.....
844772207221850112 2017-03-22 04:46:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JRsBBQ JR, you & your family have my deepest sympathies & condolences. May God protect & heal you during your time of loss. #RIPJanRoss
844765682294145026 2017-03-22 04:20:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @MRoyer3 And I'm now done with this conversation.
844765569656119296 2017-03-22 04:19:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @MRoyer3 Yes, I do.....and this isn't it.
844764991454535684 2017-03-22 04:17:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing @MRoyer3 And you know that how? He killed one guy. Wouldn't you think he would've attacked more if that was true?
844764644132601863 2017-03-22 04:16:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @MRoyer3 https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/terrorism https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/terrorism http://www.dictionary.com/browse/terrorism

844763673369362433 2017-03-22 04:12:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing @MRoyer3 He just wanted to kill black men. That's why it's a hate crime. However, he had no over-reaching goal...
844763436194062336 2017-03-22 04:11:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing @MRoyer3 I didn't say it wasn't ideological. He admittedly has a hatred of black men and lashed out with intent.
844760675154980865 2017-03-22 04:00:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing @MRoyer3 That is what is missing here, which is why it doesn't meet the definition of terrorism.
844760542598217730 2017-03-22 03:59:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing @MRoyer3 Violence meant to intimidate & coerce with the purpose of achieving a political or ideological goal.
844744148913655808 2017-03-22 02:54:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ShaunKing Hate crime? Yes. Domestic terrorism? No.

844707257292083200 2017-03-22 00:27:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealLilyThai3 I know this was from last summer in SA. Which show did you go to (Fri, Sat, Sun)? Btw, I saw him this past Saturday in Austin
844704895454318595 2017-03-22 00:18:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ATXANT10 Not usually that bad until 7 (Thanks Dell Match-Play), but it's usually pretty bad

844418354211426304 2017-03-21 05:19:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 @moscowpyro @LikeABost59 If he was so good as a rookie, why didn't he supplant Church or Wilcox as the starter?
844418039219130368 2017-03-21 05:18:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 @moscowpyro @LikeABost59 I'm not saying Jones can't/won't be good, but he hasn't shown difference-maker ability.
844417320781058049 2017-03-21 05:15:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 @moscowpyro @LikeABost59 Yup, and he excelled to the point that Romo never saw the field again. Jones didn't....
844417116300345344 2017-03-21 05:15:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr So, you're saying his crappy play over the last two seasons has nothing to do with this? Seriously?
844416259424948224 2017-03-21 05:11:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr As I just said.....  Free agency is two weeks in. Chill....
844415596209033216 2017-03-21 05:09:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @MatthewACherry Free agency has only been active for two weeks. Chill.....

844413865878310912 2017-03-21 05:02:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 @moscowpyro And he was so good that he was made the starter this past.......  Oh, wait......

844404890415828992 2017-03-21 04:26:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Garrett_Greene This is beautiful....
844399702909030402 2017-03-21 04:05:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Clarence is correct. Neither Jones, Brown, or Lawrence have shown themselves to be difference makers as yet.
844399326591930368 2017-03-21 04:04:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 Gotcha. He was still picked at 16, not 28. Also, playing guard as a rookie is a different world from playing safety
844398599278661632 2017-03-21 04:01:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 Byron Jones didn't start as a rookie.
844398518085259265 2017-03-21 04:01:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 Dallas picks #28 this year.
844398468550574082 2017-03-21 04:00:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 La'el Collins wasn't a rookie. Also, 'Zeke was the #4 pick & rated as a top 10 prospect across the board.
844397650510270464 2017-03-21 03:57:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GaryClarkJr You are far from alone, brother....
844396926934110208 2017-03-21 03:54:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Topgolf @SkinWade It is a pretty sweet spot....
844389622813790213 2017-03-21 03:25:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 @DaltShades Not moreso than Church.....  Heath is a limited player, physically. He is not a starting quality safety in the NFL.
844389096562835456 2017-03-21 03:23:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 So, you're saying the Dallas defense will improve at safety with a rookie starting? Uh-huh....
844384732834095105 2017-03-21 03:06:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 With what players, Jeff? Jones and who? Jeff Heath is not an upgrade.
844383259085717504 2017-03-21 03:00:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sgw94 @Bitterwhiteguy No he doesn't, because he hasn't been a good QB for a while now.
844244820575043584 2017-03-21 17:50:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm @Eldendor Brilliant....
844244658318442497 2017-03-21 17:49:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He could be a slot WR in the NFL, but you're right....MUCH greater upside on the diamond.
844035244730826754 2017-03-20 03:57:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JasonMinnix I think an owner has every right to tell his coach "No, not tonight".

843620233793495040 2017-03-19 00:28:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @jeffchaley It's still a worse look for OSU, but Underwood will take a hit for this.
843618974214619136 2017-03-19 00:23:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy After one year?
843618503596949505 2017-03-19 00:21:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy And it isn't a very good look for Underwood either, considering how fast he took that job.
843618244892278785 2017-03-19 00:20:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy That's incredible, and a horrible look for OSU.
843617974250602496 2017-03-19 00:19:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB That has to be either a block or a charge. It can't be a no-call.
843617203249434624 2017-03-19 00:16:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Wow.....um, hey T. Boone....are you or aren't you?
843616574007382016 2017-03-19 00:13:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy What is so toxic at Ok St that Brad Underwood just bolted for Illinois like he was being chased?
843505566932746242 2017-03-19 16:52:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RicBucher @kmotto77 Yeah, really. Their 1st priority is winning a title.
843331178476290048 2017-03-18 05:19:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamelf @clarencehilljr Also, 2 judges had it 115-112

843330364861005824 2017-03-18 05:16:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RicBucher The goal of the coaches/teams is to win a title. That's the 1st priority, not making sure the fans are entertained.
843329633634410496 2017-03-18 05:13:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Our guy @CedGolden gave the fight to Jacobs.

841578157102755840 2017-03-14 09:14:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShaunKing @ChrisMosser He needs someone to take up his mantle that he can support, but not run himself. He'll be 78 in 2020.

841470583414108166 2017-03-13 02:06:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chadfelixg Then maybe you should have phrased it that way from the get-go....  Your original tweets did not convey that message. Be better.

840984632262815747 2017-03-12 17:55:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cmbyrne324 Austin isn't the only city they've had this fight with, nor the only city they've left.
840982788648128512 2017-03-12 17:48:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CorbinCasteel Also, I'm not arguing on the quality, or lack thereof, of the regulations. I'm just talking about the actions of Uber & Lyft.
840981508571709440 2017-03-12 17:43:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cmbyrne324 Actually, the regulations that started on January 1st are the same for ridesharing services and cabs.
840981259077713920 2017-03-12 17:42:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CorbinCasteel And we could have had them at least through the end of the year, maybe longer, had Uber & Lyft chosen to stay & negotiate.
840980444325765120 2017-03-12 17:38:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB I read the proposition that Uber & Lyft composed for that vote very carefully, as well as the city's proposed rules. Did you?
840979451932487681 2017-03-12 17:35:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CorbinCasteel Needlessly in your opinion, not mine, and yes, they provided a useful service. They chose to stop. Also, my options are fine.
840969320616361984 2017-03-12 16:54:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cmbyrne324 Actually, no it's not. No one told Uber & Lyft they had to leave. They chose to in leiu continuing to negotiate with the city.
840968927085760512 2017-03-12 16:53:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Then when they lost, they picked up their ball & well before the regulations went into effect instead of continuing negotiations
840968532603068417 2017-03-12 16:51:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB They spent millions on an election that they forced because they weren't getting their way in discussions with the city. (1/2)
840949309034098690 2017-03-12 15:35:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FOXSports @slmandel Duke has no business being top seed, sorry.....
840947173613273090 2017-03-12 15:26:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MayorAdler @CorbinCasteel No, the election happened because Uber & Lyft forced a ballot initiative in lieu of negotiating with the city.
840819626342789120 2017-03-11 06:59:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm I can't choose one, but I can say two....  En Vogue Boyz II Men

840817356343562240 2017-03-11 06:50:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Nope, didn't say that....just being accurate about what really went down. Uber & Lyft chose to leave. No one forced them.
840799954134278144 2017-03-11 05:41:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GaryParrishCBS 11-7 & 5th in the ACC is not top-seed worthy. Sorry....
840796980515373058 2017-03-11 05:29:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB No, they didn't. Uber & Lyft chose to leave after they lost an election that they forced, that they thought they would win.
840787544082128896 2017-03-11 04:52:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Alyssa_Milano Like most (if not all) Texans, I love my state. However, like an alcoholic uncle, I'm also sometimes embarrassed by my state.
840786549239353344 2017-03-11 04:48:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB You know the city doesn't run/operate the ride-sharing apps, right?

840058188640706560 2017-03-09 04:34:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Did you have Phil Collins on stand-by?
840057393388093441 2017-03-09 04:31:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JoeConchaTV @WillMcAvoyACN Precisely. These hiring increases are based on previous quarter results, if not the previous 6 months.

840055896751386625 2017-03-09 04:25:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @juryverdicts You're kidding, right?
840054398332092416 2017-03-09 04:19:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN @JoeConchaTV The question is, how many of these hiring increases were planned prior to the election? My guess is most of them

840044240377896960 2017-03-09 03:38:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Look, Shaka isn't going anywhere for a few years, nor should he be. Let's just hope he learned from this year.
840043773929361410 2017-03-09 03:36:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Nor can anyone truly, but we can see what happened as a result....
840043595495297024 2017-03-09 03:36:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Bottom line, Shaka gambled that SOMEONE would develop into a player who could competently run point. It didn't happen....
840042958263017474 2017-03-09 03:33:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Hopefully not, but this team also lacked depth this year. Are you saying simply having another PG means Coleman doesn't come?
840042172531560450 2017-03-09 03:30:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @jeffchaley Right....I'm not down on Shaka or his abilities. I'm just saying he didn't do a good job this year.
840041737338908672 2017-03-09 03:28:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott And, obviously, the risk did not pan out....
840041681613393925 2017-03-09 03:28:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott I don't know. I don't follow basketball recruiting enough to remember who was out there or available. I do know it was a risk.
840041277391540226 2017-03-09 03:27:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Well, considering Taylor was a major reason for that, I'd say the players get at least half the credit.
840041046465757186 2017-03-09 03:26:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott That would have been worth the risk.
840040988613726208 2017-03-09 03:25:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Well, considering Jones hardly played the point this year & isn't a true point to begin with, maybe you lose Young, not Jones.
840040481090330624 2017-03-09 03:23:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Now, some of that is also on the players, but it falls on the coach as well.
840040394436071426 2017-03-09 03:23:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Also, when your team continues to make the same mistakes, over and over, throughout the season, you're not getting through.
840040207940517888 2017-03-09 03:22:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott I haven't seen all your other tweets, but I'll start with his gamble at the PG position that didn't pan out.
840039916662865920 2017-03-09 03:21:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Just like your mama taught you.....
840035265540440064 2017-03-09 03:03:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 And that loss was on a last-second shot....   The '11 team was robbed by the refs. Last year they lost on a half-court shot.
840034951257038848 2017-03-09 03:01:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @jeffchaley Agreed.
840033635566776320 2017-03-09 02:56:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Do you think Shaka did a great, mistake-free coaching job this year?
840033419602120704 2017-03-09 02:55:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @jeffchaley @MBHORNSFAN @chrisgb00 Robbed by the refs & lost to Arizona in 2nd-rd in '11. Lost in 2nd-rd to Michigan in '14.
840032578551853060 2017-03-09 02:52:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @jeffchaley @MBHORNSFAN @chrisgb00 Lost by 5 to Duke in the 2nd-rd in '09. Lost on a last-second shot to Wake in 1st-rd '10.
840032156739067905 2017-03-09 02:50:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @jeffchaley @MBHORNSFAN @chrisgb00 You mean the team that got robbed?
840031572652879872 2017-03-09 02:48:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @jeffchaley @MBHORNSFAN @chrisgb00 "Done nothing" just simply isn't accurate
840030757754146816 2017-03-09 02:45:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @jeffchaley @MBHORNSFAN I think it's silly to even start speculating whether he can or can't yet.
840030378102534144 2017-03-09 02:43:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @jeffchaley @MBHORNSFAN When you look at his track record, I think you have an idea at least. his time at VCU still counts.
840030150922252290 2017-03-09 02:42:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott I agree with that, but would agree that despite that, this team signficantly underachieved?
840029809396895745 2017-03-09 02:41:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @jeffchaley Agreed, and I'm not (nor have I ever) advocating that.
840029653553291264 2017-03-09 02:40:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott When your team goes 11-22, then you failed as a coach. Shaka will say that himself. I'm just saying the blame isn't only on him
840028434042515456 2017-03-09 02:36:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott There is plenty of blame for this season to go around, from Shaka and all the way down the roster.
840027528177803264 2017-03-09 02:32:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StanfordBSB @RiceBaseball I got confused for a second, lol.... @AlexDunlapNFL
840027011502473216 2017-03-09 02:30:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MattMackowiak Tevin, both his presence while on the team...then losing him, is a significant part of the story.
840017025921634305 2017-03-09 01:50:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KirkoGrinds @justinwells2424 @chrisgb00 DON'T JINX HIM!!!!
840016727987609600 2017-03-09 01:49:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SInow What the hell did he do to his nose THIS time??
840001736890863616 2017-03-09 00:49:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy It seems WVU is allowed to hold guys and swat their arms with impunity....
839997798711996417 2017-03-09 00:34:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @miakhalifa McCloughan wasn't, and still isn't, the problem with the Redskins. Daniel Snyder is.
839995865074958337 2017-03-09 00:26:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Moving your possible closer to the rotation right now would be pure idiocy
839985019405893632 2017-03-09 23:43:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Tony is gone regardless, it's simply a matter of how. Like I said, maybe they're ok taking the whole cap hit now.
839984465044750337 2017-03-09 23:41:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde But it's still his team. He has deferred, mostly, to Stephen & Jason on player-personnel stuff, but this one is personal to Jerry
839983189733048320 2017-03-09 23:36:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Jerry still has the final say when he wants it.
839982889307631616 2017-03-09 23:35:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Maybe they're ok taking the whole cap hit this year, but I think it's stupid.
839982587414212609 2017-03-09 23:33:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He can't just let Tony go so he's trying to manufacture a trade to get something back, even though it hurts them cap-wise
839982232957775872 2017-03-09 23:32:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde This is all about Jerry and his bad-for-business attachment to players. In this case, Romo....
839981600742002688 2017-03-09 23:29:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Yes, because trading him means you take the whole hit this year
839981368117477376 2017-03-09 23:28:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde And please just release him....a trade actually hurts the team overall.
839978283391430660 2017-03-09 23:16:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @zonedmike @ChrisDuel @rodbabers @SportsBuffet1 I'm apparently in the minority of people who think a trade is bad for Dallas.
839978055531671553 2017-03-09 23:15:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm Jerry is trying to manufacture a trade, even though it's not the best thing for his team.
839977583932502017 2017-03-09 23:13:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @zonedmike @ChrisDuel @rodbabers @SportsBuffet1 I need to be sitting in with you guys for this today....
839977234496626688 2017-03-09 23:12:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EPAScottPruitt Did I miss something? When did you become a scientist, sir? Stop speaking out of your ass about things you don't know about.
839969639023202304 2017-03-09 22:42:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs Ok, so then most refs work games for multiple conferences throughout the year, correct?
839966144903729153 2017-03-09 22:28:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm Not if you look good in them 
839965428935974912 2017-03-09 22:25:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots Yup....they beat #1.
839964526040809472 2017-03-09 22:22:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BloggingTheBoys He wasn't worth trying to match that? Really?
839963368412872705 2017-03-09 22:17:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs I could be wrong, but I didn't think NCAA b-ball officials were locked in to one conference. I thought they were assigned regions.
839962210608766977 2017-03-09 22:12:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy They just called the foul on the wrong guy. He was tripped.

839940008513527808 2017-03-09 20:44:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Good question....
839939899906101248 2017-03-09 20:44:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast Ok, NOW they can trade for Romo, lol....
839939788786532353 2017-03-09 20:43:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher Much greater chance now
839939441183567872 2017-03-09 20:42:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> Unbelievable....https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/839937960103530499
839939058818232320 2017-03-09 20:40:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher Holy shit....
839938605695004673 2017-03-09 20:39:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn Then the other $10.7M on next year's cap.
839938439986434053 2017-03-09 20:38:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn you're reading it wrong. Released/traded now=$5M in cap space now. Released June 1st=$5M now + $9M on June 2nd.
839935298742145025 2017-03-09 20:25:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn http://overthecap.com/salary-cap/dallas-cowboys
839934086944796672 2017-03-09 20:21:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn I promise I'm not.
839928492997373956 2017-03-09 19:58:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn That initial  $5M still happens regardless though. It's the other $19.6M that's under debate.
839927255623221249 2017-03-09 19:53:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman pic.twitter.com/NK5c1uCnyS
839926715002535936 2017-03-09 19:51:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn But you still get it. It allows for flexibility when it comes to contract extensions or signing other June 1st cuts
839925311470985216 2017-03-09 19:46:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn The $5M would happen now regardless of trade or release. Taking the whole hit now throws away this season.
839923413112193024 2017-03-09 19:38:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn same money, just not all at once, which free up space this off-season.
839923192558923777 2017-03-09 19:37:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn Correct, which frees up cap space this year
839922997016346625 2017-03-09 19:37:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn You're talking about 1 mid-round pick at best, and the cap should be important to you. Releasing Tony frees up room
839922313663561728 2017-03-09 19:34:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @PrestonShawn He would be dumb TO trade him. The return would not REMOTELY be worth the cap space you save.
839922061850128386 2017-03-09 19:33:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers Jerry would be hurting his team by doing this. It makes no sense.
839921819947778048 2017-03-09 19:32:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> This is why trading Tony has never made sense, folks. @realjerryjones, I love Tony too, but come on man....https://twitter.com/AndrewBrandt/status/839918111470010370
839921364400279558 2017-03-09 19:30:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidMooreDMN If I'm correct on the cap, Denver could take his contract as is, whereas Houston would need it re-worked, yes?
839921119062814721 2017-03-09 19:29:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast Right?
839920667256569863 2017-03-09 19:27:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Done....
839919567921098752 2017-03-09 19:23:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast That's a huge assumption considering Denver can take his contact as is. Also, they better save some money for that OL.
839918885205868544 2017-03-09 19:20:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast If the Texans trade for Romo, they will be committing over $31M of their cap to QBs. That's insane.

838864335459995648 2017-03-06 21:30:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Hell yeah....
838862652550037506 2017-03-06 21:23:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SirPatStew Sir, your work in 'Logan' & portrayal of Prof. X throughout has been exemplary! As a fan of both the character & you, thank you!
838860014290939906 2017-03-06 21:13:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealHughJackman Brother, phenomenal job, and that young girl was amazing!! Sad to see that character go away, but all things come to an end
838857636682543107 2017-03-06 21:03:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Fly ball pitchers with below average stuff tend to do that.

838601338023985152 2017-03-05 04:05:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo The ending was funny
838596716312035332 2017-03-05 03:46:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps One would hope so....
838586367013707777 2017-03-05 03:05:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Rolondo Blackmon was my all-time favorite Dallas Maverick....until 2011.

838578755899621378 2017-03-05 02:35:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde That would be pure poetry....
838578640090771456 2017-03-05 02:35:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde They have assembled a team that may have something if they can add piece or two this off-season.
838577849825132545 2017-03-05 02:31:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I will be making the trek up to Dallas to see him play live again before he retires.

838547877047713792 2017-03-05 00:32:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon Or, more likely, the people that his people have been talking to are bugged....

838240179483729921 2017-03-04 04:10:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson I'd much rather see that fight.
838239802143223810 2017-03-04 04:08:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson 115-113 Garcia?? Puh-lease....
838239607208689666 2017-03-04 04:07:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @danrafaelespn Split decision was terrible. The judge that went 115-113 for Garcia should be questioned, strongly.
838238672713617409 2017-03-04 04:04:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson I have Thurman 116-112
838235200987541504 2017-03-04 03:50:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson He's not dominating it, but he is controlling it.
838229772337573889 2017-03-04 03:28:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Agreed....  Too many weight classes and organizations....
838229352194138112 2017-03-04 03:27:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris They like big fights with name guys, for sure
838229099055304704 2017-03-04 03:26:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson 2 & 3 were both close.....split them. 2-1 Thurman.
838228746515726336 2017-03-04 03:24:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I agree, but do you realize how much $$ CBS would have to shell out to promoters to make that happen?
838228351101911040 2017-03-04 03:23:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson Vicious intentions....
838227743619837957 2017-03-04 03:20:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Agree on the 1st part, the 2nd part will never happen.

832465497182515200 2017-02-16 05:43:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @billmaher (2/2) There are some people that don't deserve a platform. If you booked Milo, who's next? Alex Jones? Richard Spencer?
832464657419939840 2017-02-16 05:40:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @billmaher I respect your desire to have diverse voices on your show. It's one of the things that makes it so great. However.... (1/2)
832463636366897153 2017-02-16 05:36:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd There's going to be some growing pains, but yeah....the defense sucked. Too many penalties and a couple of INT chances missed.

832407143613501441 2017-02-16 01:51:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thereallisaann I was able to essentially block the jackasses from bringing the show down. :D
832406779707396096 2017-02-16 01:50:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thereallisaann Very true....I worked in that industry for 9 years as a producer, so I got the screen the calls. ;)
832406584567414785 2017-02-16 01:49:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thereallisaann I can understand where you're coming from, I just hate seeing the actions of a-holes hold people back.
832406140352864257 2017-02-16 01:47:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thereallisaann My main point was, if this is something you would really like to do....go for it.
832406022123831297 2017-02-16 01:47:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thereallisaann But the site admins can, yes? So, see if you can work something out with them to block that garbage.
832405361508413441 2017-02-16 01:44:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thereallisaann (2/2) You can't control what those idiots say, so it shouldn't control what you want to do. Just block them and move forward
832405152736874496 2017-02-16 01:43:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thereallisaann Lisa, I'll just say this...do not, I repeat, DO NOT...let the actions of jackass trolls affect your decisions in life. (1/2)

832354398240178176 2017-02-16 22:22:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @passantino Shep has been one of the few (maybe only) consistently sane people at Fox News.
832345428356169730 2017-02-16 21:46:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Have to finish later....gotta run.
832344150003613697 2017-02-16 21:41:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Agree or disagree....the GOP has supplied the MSM with more sensationalistic ammo than the Democrats from 2000 through today?
832343485353164801 2017-02-16 21:38:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde The MSM has (and still does) lean more towards the sensational than they do towards the left.
832343154812661760 2017-02-16 21:37:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde It's real, but it's not as great as the GOP wants to think it is. The GOP refuses to accept their hand in this.
832342853816877058 2017-02-16 21:36:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde They simply have supplied more sensationalistic ammo since Clinton left office.
832342595959394307 2017-02-16 21:35:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I know it's real. I didn't say it wasn't.
832342480494407680 2017-02-16 21:34:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde The MSM has always had a much greater bias (and still does) towards the sensational. The thing the GOP refuses to accept is....
832342231398961153 2017-02-16 21:33:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I know the MSM has a bias towards the left, but it's not as great as conservatives want to believe it is.
832341859443830784 2017-02-16 21:32:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde But that's what he accuses them of
832341497546670085 2017-02-16 21:30:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde The main problem I have is, he's not saying the MSM isn't fair. He's saying they're intentionally dishonest, which isn't true.
832338527727808512 2017-02-16 21:19:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman I'm not an Astros fan, but you're 100% correct.
832336451421556737 2017-02-16 21:10:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ImToBlame @sherrodharris I can forgive them, but I'll never respect their opinion on anything political ever again.

832059554573737984 2017-02-15 02:50:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot But like you said, it's not like that's around the corner. Trading George is a thought, though, if the return value is there.
832058735472340992 2017-02-15 02:47:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot Something will happen to Cavs (injuries probably) in at least 1 of those seasons. You want to be the team that takes advantage.
832038193641963520 2017-02-15 01:25:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I was more thinking as a way to escape all of this, so yes....Four Seasons.

832033995412140032 2017-02-15 01:08:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot The likelihood of that happening, at least in the NFL, is beyond slim.
832033164021362688 2017-02-15 01:05:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GregAbbott_TX @statesman And you should try actually governing, Greg....and by that, I mean doing what's best for ALL the people of Texas.

831366044405137410 2017-02-13 04:54:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @brooklynmike21 But there wasn't....that's the point. That scolding press conference was beyond the pale and HIGHLY unprofessional.
831365492229148672 2017-02-13 04:52:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @brooklynmike21 The public has a right to know what info they HAVE, not what info they MAY HAVE.
831365370955104260 2017-02-13 04:52:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @brooklynmike21 Both actions were unprecedented and GREATLY out of step with what is considered acceptable.
831365178876915713 2017-02-13 04:51:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @brooklynmike21 His press conference this summer never should've happened. His letter to Congress in October: Never. Should. Have. Happened.
831364130254757888 2017-02-13 04:47:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @brooklynmike21 Sooooo that makes it ok that the FBI interfered with the election? Just stop....
831363764113047556 2017-02-13 04:45:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_McMullin @wdburris I don't care. Comey and a group of agents (mostly out of the NY office) intentionally interfered in this election.
831363172422578177 2017-02-13 04:43:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @brooklynmike21 No, I mean James Comey and the FBI.....just like I said.
831362388431605760 2017-02-13 04:40:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_McMullin Let's also PLEASE not forget about James Comey and the FBI's interference in this election.

831350599388119041 2017-02-13 03:53:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Garrett_Greene @craigway1 Craig, I thought the win tonight for @TexasWBB was  even more impressive than the Baylor win. Thoughts?

831335891813724160 2017-02-13 02:54:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy May have been 13 in the 4th.... against Baylor they had a 15-point lead after 3 and had to hang on to win.
831335509720981505 2017-02-13 02:53:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Tonight they came back from 10 down(I think) in the 4th, then had 4 players foul out in the OTs to FSU's 1.
831334970077622272 2017-02-13 02:51:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy That win tonight, I'd argue, was more impressive than the Baylor win.

829885725323706368 2017-02-09 02:52:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> Dallas can afford him, but as you said....their money is better spent elsewhere.
829885233726103552 2017-02-09 02:50:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WallacesOwner I disagree with that definition.
829884725019947008 2017-02-09 02:48:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WallacesOwner That basically means someone will overpay him
829884597810900993 2017-02-09 02:48:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> Let me state it better....he'll get offered more money than Dallas should pay him. Butler does need to improve though.
829883624820502528 2017-02-09 02:44:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> Williams will get more money than he's worth from someone. I think Butler can be an acceptable replacement.

829511719173103616 2017-02-08 02:06:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon Just like Bannon, Trump, and Tx LG Dan Patrick. They're just begging for it....

829471879329153024 2017-02-08 23:28:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps @USCocksman I just read the story. It's not something to get in a twist about.....yet.
829470692244652033 2017-02-08 23:23:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Ah, so Tom Herman got his "Jenga" Initiative through in MLB, I see....

829445309893898241 2017-02-08 21:42:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @KNBR Their style is what leads to lack of toughness questions
829442009161166852 2017-02-08 21:29:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger My point is the NCAA should have already been involved. It wouldn't be hard for them to focus only on things under their purview
829441105506795520 2017-02-08 21:25:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger We also know Kendall Briles violated NCAA rules on multiple occasions. It's not unreasonable to think more violations occurred.
829440479599132674 2017-02-08 21:23:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger and therefore punishable by the NCAA....
829440360908779522 2017-02-08 21:22:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Title IX violations are also violations of NCAA rules.
829439695998304256 2017-02-08 21:20:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger They got out way over their skis in the Sandusky case for sure, but this case is different & much more within their jurisdiction
829437458748149761 2017-02-08 21:11:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @USCocksman I would argue it's not ONLY their job, but they do have a job to do in this case that they have neglected.
829436360956186624 2017-02-08 21:06:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman @mikefinger Complete justice? No, but that shouldn't prevent the @NCAA from doing its job and punishing where & how it's able to
829435538356715521 2017-02-08 21:03:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @USCocksman Mike, you're probably right in some cases, but I think most just want justice done.

829166968158699520 2017-02-07 03:16:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RTcoe @mattmfm Every Democrat senator should now read that letter on the floor

829158921071894528 2017-02-07 02:44:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @hodgman @maxjrosenthal Then every Democrat Senator should read it aloud, in session.

828445374591418368 2017-02-05 03:29:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> You have to give the Patriots credit for the comeback, but that's also the biggest choke ever by the Falcons.

827364761365012480 2017-02-02 03:55:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @seanhannity Sean, why are you supporting the Russian government? #Traitor
827362440044232704 2017-02-02 03:45:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @RickinTex @MONTMAN9500 It wouldn't surprise me. Seek help, sir....

827358856086949888 2017-02-02 03:31:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HoustonChron @YoungCons @GregAbbott_TX The only good Governor is one who cares about the law all the time....not just when it suits him.
827358540767571968 2017-02-02 03:30:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser The Gov. @GregAbbott_TX only cares about the law when it suits him. The actions of @SallyTCSheriff are legal. He doesn't care.
827357105896226817 2017-02-02 03:24:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @statesman @GregAbbott_TX Since you are an attorney, you should know that our Sheriff's actions are perfectly legal. You do know that right?
827354974497755136 2017-02-02 03:16:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @statesman I see that our rights are once again allowed to be violated
827314952885112832 2017-02-02 00:37:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> So yeah....it's a bit nuts.
827314747091607553 2017-02-02 00:36:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> My friend bought a house in Wells Branch in 2006 for between $140k-$145K....it's now worth about $250K.
827314470481489921 2017-02-02 00:35:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> So maybe my $1500/month estimate was too low? lol
827313658623623169 2017-02-02 00:32:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> I was referring to the apartment, hehehe....

827272770589323265 2017-02-02 21:49:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @NRO Regardless of the senators' reasons, voting against Devos is 100% in the nation's best interests.
827264388016988161 2017-02-02 21:16:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Well the violence is what caused the cancelation, which is wrong.
827261898429124609 2017-02-02 21:06:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde There is no excuse for the violence that occurred. I agree. I thought the "dumb" comment was referring to the Schwarzenegger jab.

826667811531608064 2017-01-31 05:45:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman From what I remember reading, it did seem like that guy conned everyone.

826656754696077312 2017-01-31 05:01:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jeff_Caplan @mattdpearce True, but it needs to be reigned in, not dismantled completely.
826654682609225728 2017-01-31 04:53:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @redsteeze Do you really want to go down this road? #MerrickGarland
826653988632326148 2017-01-31 04:50:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Also, I know Chance, but this is the 1st time I've ever heard of him getting some kind of payoff. I'm also not naive though.....
826653445650276353 2017-01-31 04:48:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Oh shit. Did Chance work for that guy? I knew about the Detmer Bros involvement, but I think they got out before the fraud.

826303417777799169 2017-01-30 05:37:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy One can hope for one outcome and still not be surprised at the other.
826276038032420864 2017-01-30 03:48:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy And neither you, nor I, are surprised one iota that Trump has taken that mantle and will run away with it.....
826161845505499138 2017-01-30 20:15:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I will effort to do so.
826160671645630464 2017-01-30 20:10:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Well, I apparently did know, but I was just double-checking that I was correct. ;) I've been there once.
826159848479932417 2017-01-30 20:07:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde sorry, west side
826159399861358595 2017-01-30 20:05:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde is that the bar located in the basement part of a building just on the east side of the capitol?

825135558737412096 2017-01-27 00:17:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachTomHerman @LHSHonFB I can understand that sentiment
825129231747280896 2017-01-27 23:51:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @treyluvsoasis Um, what?
825128646218305536 2017-01-27 23:49:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @RobertJ80162940 My point is, some of those 51 may have already spoken out
825128363455049729 2017-01-27 23:48:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> .@CoachTomHerman Some friendly advice, Coach....if you really want your buddy on staff here, you better get him in front of a camera FAST!!
825127707419766784 2017-01-27 23:45:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @craigfloyd I am open to the possibility that not everyone on the staff knew, but that possibility is small.
825127315747246080 2017-01-27 23:44:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd @Bitterwhiteguy That's kind of where I'm at...but the odds that he, at least, didn't have any knowledge of events are dwindling.
825127041251016709 2017-01-27 23:43:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @craigfloyd Personally, I wouldn't have either, but I also haven't know the guy for a decade and a half like Herman has.
825126834819969024 2017-01-27 23:42:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @RobertJ80162940 Really? Use the logic center of your brain and think about it for a minute....
825126698043711488 2017-01-27 23:41:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @craigfloyd I tend to agree, but I'm not 100% on that side of the fence yet.
825126534142971905 2017-01-27 23:41:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @RobertJ80162940 Does the 51 include victims who've already spoken out? Also the ones Elliot & Ukwuachu raped? Do you know?
825124482880827392 2017-01-27 23:33:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RobertJ80162940 @SBN_Wescott Sure, that possibility does exist, but the odds of that being the case are EXTREMELY low.
825124279402508288 2017-01-27 23:32:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy But the odds that he knew nothing are growing smaller and smaller, even though he's not named in this suit.
825124063542640640 2017-01-27 23:31:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Without making a public statement apologizing, condemning Briles, & emphatically stating he had no knowledge, he can't stay.
825123085061877760 2017-01-27 23:27:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott It's "Horny", FYI....
825122822368395266 2017-01-27 23:26:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I would go as far as to say condemning Briles....
825120914677362688 2017-01-27 23:18:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy A public statement from @Coach_Horny apologizing for his statements and distancing himself from Briles is a necessity now.
825116964435742720 2017-01-27 23:03:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TamiLahren If you believe @realDonaldTrump is a "Man of God", then you have absolutely no clue as to what a true "Man of God" really is.

825080791097028609 2017-01-27 20:39:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 @WWMcClyde I could live w/ turf if they'd compromise & make a dirt infield, base lines, & home plate area.
825078517692002305 2017-01-27 20:30:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 @WWMcClyde That's because there isn't one.

824828005021265920 2017-01-26 03:54:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban It would probably be higher, but it wouldn't be near that high.

824673452120543232 2017-01-26 17:40:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith This 'bro' sounds like real winner.....
824507110616629250 2017-01-25 06:39:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_McMullin I wish I had any semblance of faith that they would, but I don't.....

824469980100038656 2017-01-25 04:12:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onlxn @BFriedmanDC I call bullshit. That is not what they need to do.
824469364137197568 2017-01-25 04:09:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BFriedmanDC Why? Did you actually listen to what she said?
824449236217503748 2017-01-25 02:49:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SenFeinstein @daisykpgardner Mrs. Feinstein....how can you possibly justify voting yes for this man?
824448189508059136 2017-01-25 02:45:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mrBobbyBones He performs for paparazzi......
824448041222623232 2017-01-25 02:45:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm Perhaps.....
824438437386317824 2017-01-25 02:06:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onlxn Infrastructure spending are really the only two things Trump and Dems have in common. Nothing wrong with working with him there.
824409735864733697 2017-01-25 00:12:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> Donald Trump is not mentally stable....https://twitter.com/GlennThrush/status/824398685178122243
824384948425605120 2017-01-25 22:34:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PrevailandRide I wish that were the case. For the vast majority of the people who voted for him, he's the ONLY one they listen to.
824351679457935361 2017-01-25 20:22:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StewMyrick where is it? AT&T?
824344579990319104 2017-01-25 19:53:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LamarSmithTX21 @jaketapper Lamar Smith represents my part of Austin, and he is a science-denying embarrassment.
824289245368094720 2017-01-25 16:14:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde perfect...
824276290941370368 2017-01-25 15:22:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde This is "Distraction 101"
824130327052517376 2017-01-24 05:42:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @SBN_Wescott He's not worth being arrested over. I would have simply cursed his existence.
824129662339125249 2017-01-24 05:39:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @Bitterwhiteguy Rove and Alex Jones have both come into my restaurant a few times (not together). Each time, I felt slimed.
824127802542870528 2017-01-24 05:32:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @VeraMBergen Then maybe @SenJohnMcCain will actually step up and do something instead of curling up into a ball.

824026194135973888 2017-01-24 22:48:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN @eldarmark Not a fake quote.... @guardian reworded it a little, but that's basically what he said. Assange is a lying POS.
824024508474462208 2017-01-24 22:42:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BadlandsNPS @WillMcAvoyACN That must be it then....

824006093751877633 2017-01-24 21:28:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser To be fair to Ted, it looks like Alex basically cornered him at an elevator. He doesn't look exactly pleased to be listening.
823967964789698560 2017-01-24 18:57:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JimVertuno @Bitterwhiteguy Maybe they skip over it because Saban didn't come here?
823743903929139200 2017-01-23 04:07:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @denngree @sherrodharris This shouldn't be a surprise. Trade is the only issue where Bernie and Trump shared some common ground.
823742664742936576 2017-01-23 04:02:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DNC @ChrisMosser The GOP got rid of Superdelagates and look what happened....Trump.
823742438003146752 2017-01-23 04:01:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DNC @ChrisMosser Superdelagates have been around way before this primary. If Bernie's momentum is up in smoke, it's his followers own fault
823739860490063872 2017-01-23 03:51:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DNC @ChrisMosser They're changing leadership. That seems like an acknowledgement to me....
823735238119608321 2017-01-23 03:32:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DNC @ChrisMosser Figure out what? There was no rigging of the primary.
823650895489626112 2017-01-23 21:57:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Now, if only Donny would follow his example....  I can't believe I'm actually typing this....

823597519724838913 2017-01-23 18:25:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I'll be curious to see what thet extracted then....
823597177708670976 2017-01-23 18:24:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Well, McCain & Graham did too, so he was far from the only pussy.

823293056212406273 2017-01-22 22:15:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChristineHookEm Even in Dallas, beating that team would have been a true em-effer....
823288160289456132 2017-01-22 21:56:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Also, "Now you want to miss a FG, Crosby??"
823278213182918656 2017-01-22 21:16:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde definitely old school....
823277995284713475 2017-01-22 21:15:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I'd say his true hardcore supporters actually number between about 35-40%, but your point is still sound.
823277117966262272 2017-01-22 21:12:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FrankLuntz @WillMcAvoyACN Btw, all those signs are recyclable. So....easy clean up.
823276571654033408 2017-01-22 21:10:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JMichaelYoung1 @WWMcClyde The phrase "Trump shoulda" is one the will be used on an almost daily basis.
823212048779710465 2017-01-22 16:53:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> Shocking.....  Way to back up your words with actions @SenJohnMcCain & @LindseyGrahamSC. Oh, wait.....https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/823211126536175616
823211212917932032 2017-01-22 16:50:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FO_ASchatz @SheriffClarke I propose a motion to have Sheriff David Clarke excommunicated from th @dallascowboys fanbase. We don't want him.

823206372632358912 2017-01-22 16:31:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @POTUS @FoxNews Doing doesn't make those people, including Spicer or Trump, less stupid. It actually makes them look more so.

823089396073332736 2017-01-22 08:46:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @decker_mason @SkinWade @winstondawson @Not2religious Respect for the position and repsect for the person in it are two different things.

822556383509876741 2017-01-20 21:28:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde The will be much easier once investigations into Russian & FBI election interference actually happen and are completed.

822507865629933570 2017-01-20 18:15:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OurDailyBears Don't let Donald Trump's inauguration as President distract you from the fact that Baylor systematically covered up rape.
822322075696132097 2017-01-19 05:57:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> As @KnowTheGame60 told me "Tim Allen put together better cabinets on Home Improvement". @realDonaldTrump
822321777720164354 2017-01-19 05:56:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> The most unqualified, corrupt, & compromised President in history is trying to put together a cabinet that is equals him in those traits.
822286421293756416 2017-01-19 03:35:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChanceMock A) That's not true. B) Two wrongs are still both wrong C) All the things that happened at Trump rallies weren't fake & staged.
822285324013465600 2017-01-19 03:31:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChanceMock What that kid is doing isn't right, but let's not act like what happened at Trump rallies and Tea Party rallies didn't happen.

821892647963033601 2017-01-18 01:30:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BetsyDeVos As the son of two retired public school teachers, I'm disguted that you & @realDonaldTrump think you're fit to be the Ed. Sec.
821878939174006784 2017-01-18 00:36:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> As far as the rest of the voting, Bonds & Clemens should be in, period. Also, Schilling may be a jerk, but him dropping to 45% is ridiculous
821878042658275328 2017-01-18 00:32:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> So happy for @Pudge_Rodriguez, my favorite @Rangers player, as well as #JeffBagwell & all my @astros fan friends. Both are VERY deserving!

821490863297720323 2017-01-17 22:54:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports Just no.....to the whole idea.
821487252945727488 2017-01-17 22:39:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I can understand that. I was surprised the sentence wasn't worse.

821485858448674816 2017-01-17 22:34:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Assange is, without question, the bigger fish here, so if this gets him extradited here, is it not a good trade off?
821485235628048384 2017-01-17 22:31:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal They want to prosecute Assange, not kill him. Not yet, anyway....

820812848158871553 2017-01-15 02:00:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I agree on the grass part, just not the bats.
820812461620264961 2017-01-15 01:58:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde So HS baseball isn't baseball either?
820812093326786560 2017-01-15 01:57:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Wood bats will never return to college. Grass may return to the Disch. We'll see....I actually agree on this.
820811653541400579 2017-01-15 01:55:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Still baseball.....
820811398619992066 2017-01-15 01:54:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Although Texas baseball starts soon.
820811300137738240 2017-01-15 01:53:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Not soon enough
820811101067739136 2017-01-15 01:53:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jeffchaley Texas fans are just plain stupid about basketball. Yes, they'll be good eventually, but the rest of this season will be painful.
820809735188389888 2017-01-15 01:47:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs The two playoff games is '14 were Tony's best.
820809398264168448 2017-01-15 01:46:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cstonehoops @jeffchaley I'll watch, because I need to study for the tournament, but it will be passion-less
820809167376158720 2017-01-15 01:45:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cstonehoops @jeffchaley But without a dog in the fight, it's not as much fun to watch
820807831662247938 2017-01-15 01:40:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs Houston simply isn't an option because of Osweiller's contract.
820807661180616704 2017-01-15 01:39:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cstonehoops @jeffchaley Sports is going to suck now until March Madness, unless Texas baseball comes out hot.
820805860041564162 2017-01-15 01:32:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers I still stand by my statement that this was a better matchup for Dallas than New York.
820799597576683520 2017-01-15 01:07:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregolsen88 @JasonLaCanfora So saving your last timeout because you're still thinking TD is a bad strategy?
820798932502638592 2017-01-15 01:04:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs The spike was on 1st down, but regardless, they were think still thinking TD with over 40 seconds left. Saving the TO is smart.
820797913987252224 2017-01-15 01:00:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @wingoz Not really.....they were still thinking TD
820793839262765056 2017-01-15 00:44:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SedanoESPN Holding or illegal contact, but not PI.

820774791103807488 2017-01-15 23:28:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm It would have been an free kick from the Dallas 38. Not remotely makeable...
820770843433242625 2017-01-15 23:13:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> The 1st down personnel and play call cost them there.
820770740760936449 2017-01-15 23:12:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> There was plenty of time to run the ball in that series of downs and not have to call timeout or spike it.

820745730440777730 2017-01-15 21:33:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> Rodgers playing out of his mind. Dallas' pass rush is lacking. Rookie QB in 1st playoff start. I'm concerned. @dallascowboys PROVE ME WRONG.

820488062979506178 2017-01-14 04:29:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> Osweiller is GUARANTEED a $16M base salary next year. You're stuck with him.https://twitter.com/kipsbigboy/status/820487804258025472
820487804258025472 2017-01-14 04:28:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> For all the @HoustonTexans fans on Twitter crying to get another QB in the off-season (Romo).....  Ain't. Gonna. Happen.
820487318742192128 2017-01-14 04:26:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps He has a $16M base salary next year that is guaranteed. They're stuck with him.
820487106187427841 2017-01-14 04:25:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps No, his contract guaranteed him $37M, but the vast majority was in the 1st two years.

820482091301437441 2017-01-14 04:05:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast The Texans are stuck with him next year.
820481869221396480 2017-01-14 04:04:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ReggieTap7 Good luck with that. He is guaranteed $17M next season. They're stuck.
820478497990840325 2017-01-14 03:51:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr No chance....
820477754957250563 2017-01-14 03:48:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo oh ok.....I must have missed the one you mean then. Any vids of it, by chance?
820477441244299265 2017-01-14 03:47:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo I disagree that the Fiedorowicz play was a drop. Pass was WAY behind him, and he knocked it away from the DB. He prevented an INT.
820476820940328960 2017-01-14 03:44:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @andrewperloff Fiedorowicz didn't drop that. He knocked it away from the DB on a badly thrown ball.
820476298032218112 2017-01-14 03:42:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @wingoz Both on deflections of bad throws....
820475437084213248 2017-01-14 03:39:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @longhornfan177 Suspend him for what, exactly?
820474562618003457 2017-01-14 03:35:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FO_ASchatz I get that, but come on.....
820474460025323520 2017-01-14 03:35:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @newyscruggs @clarencehilljr He's crying because he's Tom Brady
820472800209203200 2017-01-14 03:28:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo Or is he?
820472488710836225 2017-01-14 03:27:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Disagree....
820466334458855424 2017-01-14 03:03:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> Should have had an INT on the 1st 3Q possession
820463444033933312 2017-01-14 02:51:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> Turnovers were their only shot, and turnovers have happened. That's why it's close.

820452898647707649 2017-01-14 02:09:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Very well-designed play....
820452173733576704 2017-01-14 02:06:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markschlereth It was off his hands on a diving attempt. The throw was off-target.
820451119235264512 2017-01-14 02:02:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Garrett_Greene Always adds to the ambience...
820445496275771392 2017-01-14 01:40:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @McClain_on_NFL It was the correct call.
820444946616483840 2017-01-14 01:38:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodimusprime @sherrodharris There are a lot of Representatives and Senators on the left that haven't jumped into this. So what?

820438524294037504 2017-01-14 01:12:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN He has obviously not been following twitter this week. The displeasure from Longhorn fans has been high.

820398739726725122 2017-01-14 22:34:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Actually, on replay they could have called that penalty before the kick, which would have given ATL a 1st down & the ball.
820398376218923014 2017-01-14 22:33:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Yes, because the penalty happened while the ball was in the air. No different than holding a gunner...

820030769888432128 2017-01-13 22:12:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx The circumstances surrounding the accusations and the defense thereof are entirely different.
820030636698243073 2017-01-13 22:11:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx The only similarity is you have two people defending someone else against accusations.
819990825954328583 2017-01-13 19:33:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx The situations are different. Sorry if you can't see that....
819990632718565376 2017-01-13 19:32:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx It is very much the point, because he has publicly defended the man since this was released
819989762044030976 2017-01-13 19:29:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx You're probably right....some may not. I'm not one of them.

819972477648601089 2017-01-13 18:20:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx Because they have said nothing regarding his hiring. I want assurances on-record. You don't get benefit of the doubt here.
819972122927828992 2017-01-13 18:19:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx cover up, and that his public statements of defense were misguided, I may accept that. (2/2)
819971502598737920 2017-01-13 18:16:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx If Coach Herman or AD Perrin say they did their due diligence and are convinced that he wasn't involved in any (1/2)
819971089220698113 2017-01-13 18:15:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx I. Want. An. Explanation. Why is this so hard to understand?
819970906730758147 2017-01-13 18:14:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx That statement you sent me was made in November. The Baylor BOR findings was released when Briles was fired.
819970568300662789 2017-01-13 18:13:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx So, I would like an explanation of the circumstances of his hiring.
819969950207119362 2017-01-13 18:10:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx No, I'm not. He was, however, a member of that staff, and any member of that staff has the stain attached to them.
819969470743584769 2017-01-13 18:08:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx I suggest you go back and read what the Baylor BOR released when Briles was fired.
819968946082344961 2017-01-13 18:06:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx I'm saying that he is bringing in someone who was part of a staff that covered up sexual assault, and I want to know why.
819968352139538433 2017-01-13 18:04:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx Because defending him publicly, despite the evidence, looks that way. We KNOW this happened. This isn't he-said-she-said.
819966797403275265 2017-01-13 17:58:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx Where did I say he should have his career ruined? All I want is an explanation.
819966245017714690 2017-01-13 17:56:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx The report released by Baylor on the PH investigation findings clearly stated that Briles and members of his staff did this
819965902691123200 2017-01-13 17:54:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Alyssa_Milano I can't go with you on this one. His actions, regardless of reason, put people's lives at risk.
819964741544189952 2017-01-13 17:50:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx How about the report released from the Baylor BOR themselves? Will that satisfy you?
819964416045305857 2017-01-13 17:48:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx Coach Herman thinks it's a good idea to bring any of that stain to our University as well as the level of vetting involved.
819963795787444229 2017-01-13 17:46:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx Even after the evidence was made public. So, even if he wasn't involved, an explanation is needed to tell me why....
819963594439790595 2017-01-13 17:45:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx What we don't know is which members of the staff were involved. Regardless, he was out there publicly defending Briles.
819963175332433920 2017-01-13 17:43:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx There's also actual evidence against the coach he was defending, but hey....why should that matter, right?
819962826588585985 2017-01-13 17:42:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx We know that a double-digit number of sexual assault complaints were covered up by Briles and members of his staff.
819960294667616256 2017-01-13 17:32:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx On your other points....being loyal to a spouse and being loyal to a boss are two different things.
819960006447693824 2017-01-13 17:31:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx I never once called Horny an awful person, and I never once implied anything.
819959862708858880 2017-01-13 17:30:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Orangebloodsatx You apparently love jumping to conclusions and putting words in people's mouths.
819958868570763265 2017-01-13 17:26:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving @SheainIrvingPod I believe, once he re-upped with TCU after almost leaving for Texas, he was given PC duties.
819939499216175105 2017-01-13 16:09:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dpshow @HiMyNameIsSeton @PaulPabst @brooklynfritzy You guys should reach out to Will Carroll for injury evaluation
819930440345784320 2017-01-13 15:33:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson Most of them, yes....
819927702866161664 2017-01-13 15:22:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Coach_Horny @CoachTomHerman @Orangebloodsatx Not remotely the same situation
819927425970802688 2017-01-13 15:21:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Coach_Horny @CoachTomHerman @Orangebloodsatx Gilbert wasn't on Briles staff at Baylor.
819774378455879684 2017-01-12 05:13:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachTomHerman Coach Herman, with all due respect, I believe you owe Texas fans an explanation regarding the hiring of @Coach_Horny.
819764047142854656 2017-01-12 04:32:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @JuddLegum He's exactly right, yet @jasoninthehouse feels it necessary to threaten him with subpoena over his comments.
819757371111174145 2017-01-12 04:06:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DallasStars @miakhalifa They play the @WashingtonCapit a week from Saturday.
819752663399153664 2017-01-12 03:47:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SenBookerOffice Your vote against @SenSanders amendment, and the reason you gave for it, was simply unacceptable.

819748966690648064 2017-01-12 03:32:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SenBookerOffice I was happy when I saw that I had received a follow from your account, but today....I am very disappointed in you, Senator.
819740972431056898 2017-01-12 03:00:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @waflanagan The label of "legal" or "illegal" refers the circumstances of their arrival, not their personhood.
819740681623244800 2017-01-12 02:59:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @waflanagan Legally speaking, an immigrant can be either legal or illegal, depending on the nature of their arrival into the country.
819738470780379136 2017-01-12 02:50:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @waflanagan While I agree with your sentiment, an immigrant can be illegal.....technically speaking.
819737342026072064 2017-01-12 02:46:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jasoninthehouse Have you no decency or ethics of your own, sir? Apparently not....
819735507999555584 2017-01-12 02:39:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @ATXANT10 @SBN_Wescott That and we need to know that any possible involvement in any actions at Baylor have been properly vetted.
819735175500361728 2017-01-12 02:37:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @WWMcClyde @ATXANT10 Casey Horny....and his public defense of Briles has cast him in a very bad light.
819734519188193281 2017-01-12 02:35:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters I would agree.
819734457171267584 2017-01-12 02:34:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @WWMcClyde @ATXANT10 Coach Herman's newest hire is not being well-received due to his being on Briles' staff at Baylor.
819732347931201536 2017-01-12 02:26:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @nflnetwork @andrewperloff The hole was huge and the only guy between Murray & the endzone was a safety. Peppers saved a TD and GB got a FG.
819731756282769408 2017-01-12 02:24:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @nflnetwork @andrewperloff People always focus on the Dez catch, but the play of that game was the Murray fumble in the 2Q.
819730506283679748 2017-01-12 02:19:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @WWMcClyde Well, if so, answers are needed post-haste....
819729651065044992 2017-01-12 02:15:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AstrosRants @NewbergReport @astrosrants Are you really this stupid, Astros fan?
819729251788320768 2017-01-12 02:14:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Alyssa_Milano No...and the reason why is, his actions have spoken far louder than his words ever could.
819729000381743105 2017-01-12 02:13:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott So, the AD and admin have probably been caught off-guard by this.
819728839823818754 2017-01-12 02:12:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott My guess is this hire, due to its lower level, didn't need approval any higher than Herman.
819727867382759425 2017-01-12 02:08:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters Because the hiring of this kind of coach (QC/ST asst) probably didn't have to go any higher than Herman.
819727466919034880 2017-01-12 02:07:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Such a relief when the decision becomes easy, ain't it?

819717786159185920 2017-01-12 01:28:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @WWMcClyde Texas has one of the most basketball-stupid fanbases in CBB. Anyone advocating for Shaka to be fired is a moron.

819695607195598848 2017-01-12 00:00:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris He didn't. It was a well-executed surprise.....and is was SPEC-TAC-U-LAR!!!
819683946095149056 2017-01-12 23:14:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NPR @Alyssa_Milano Alyssa, people have been tricked into believing that if they don't like/agree with a story, then it must be biased/fake.
819668928716828672 2017-01-12 22:14:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OccupyLF So it's temporary....ok. Not good, but better that permanent.

819611382177992705 2017-01-12 18:25:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving He's getting a pay-raise and no more Co-OC tag. He was playing 2nd-fiddle to Cumbie at TCU.
819608687379705857 2017-01-12 18:15:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ProFootballTalk @nflcommish Saying the @Chargers did "everything they could" is complete horseshit.
819606695303376896 2017-01-12 18:07:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving I think he and Patterson needed to part ways.

819602823763660800 2017-01-12 17:51:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @coachbronk And yes, I was aware of that.
819602697976365056 2017-01-12 17:51:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @coachbronk Doesn't matter....
819596539878404096 2017-01-12 17:26:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @coachbronk In this situation, that's simply not going to cut it. That's why Herman needs to be presses on this.
819596347942862848 2017-01-12 17:26:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @coachbronk My problem here is the "homework", for all we know, was that they were GAs together & he's known him for 16 years.
819567587776491522 2017-01-12 15:31:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TXRandy14 Good to know you don't believe in freedom of the press. One more reason to vote against you....

819407707509813248 2017-01-11 04:56:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GoodmanESPN @Bitterwhiteguy I'll say it again....Texas has one of the most basketball-stupid fanbases of any school in CBB.

818991054666027008 2017-01-10 01:20:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser this is true. I also agree with you that he wanted to be put to death.
818990220003655680 2017-01-10 01:17:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser You can be of high intelligence and great clarity....and still be mentally unstable.
818948987906650112 2017-01-10 22:33:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde That's messed up, but it's hard to argue the validity of the point.
818947112159285248 2017-01-10 22:26:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser That, plus....it seems obvious that he's mentally unbalanced.

818704277128540161 2017-01-09 06:21:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @WhatStartsHere More than slightly. For 3 quarters this game was a snoozer....

818703047723454465 2017-01-09 06:16:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bcarp3 Even as a Texas alum, it's reasonable to agree that Watson is a better passer.

818596252459925506 2017-01-09 23:12:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @costareports @omadogho @2ndTierFan After reading this, it's pretty clear that Kushner can hold no official position w/o violating the law.
818582901289877505 2017-01-09 22:19:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @costareports @omadogho @2ndTierFan Thank you. That's along the lines of what I was thinking.
818566272191492096 2017-01-09 21:13:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> To quote Hank Hill, "You've never seen a football in your life, have you?"
818558064257286146 2017-01-09 20:40:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @costareports @omadogho Show me where it says that in the law.
818557573054025728 2017-01-09 20:38:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @costareports @omadogho The law doesn't have a caveat that says "only if there is receipt of payment for services"
818557345211056128 2017-01-09 20:37:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @costareports @omadogho If he is assigned to an official position in the White House, why does it matter whether or not he works for free?
818549792951463936 2017-01-09 20:07:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @costareports How is this not against the law?
818545581522059266 2017-01-09 19:50:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Lana you also said, however, that he was in no position to talk about those things. That is not true.
818545055237545986 2017-01-09 19:48:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Lana very true
818542857795538944 2017-01-09 19:39:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Lana Your point is valid if you mean players who were involved in those extracurricular activities. Troy was not.
818542070528962565 2017-01-09 19:36:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TonySiragusa Did you actually listen to what she said? Doesn't seem like it....
818541685152055296 2017-01-09 19:35:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm Watching him hold & throw the football makes me want to quote Hank Hill. "You've never seen a football in your life, have you?"

818516614601723904 2017-01-09 17:55:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @startelegram @dallascowboys @Jeff_Caplan Not surprising....Packers (like the Cowboys & Steelers) have a national fanbase.

818273047421550592 2017-01-08 01:47:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @johnstodder Propoganda is a form of influence, not rigging.
818272851044270080 2017-01-08 01:47:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @johnstodder "Influenced" is more accurate. Rigging implies the outcome was pre-determined. Voters made a choice, even if it was a bad one
818271547857235968 2017-01-08 01:41:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @johnstodder I would be careful about using the word 'rig', because that's not really an accurate description of what happend.

818255745892368385 2017-01-08 00:39:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast I think they would have picked them over the Giants. Close call, but still....
818255309768630274 2017-01-08 00:37:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LesleyMcCaslin Agree, but I was still more worried about the Giants.
818254850286907393 2017-01-08 00:35:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Giants @michaelirvin88 As stupid as the opinion is, I hope they get ripped for it like Dallas did in '08 for the same irrelevant thing.
818254027746058241 2017-01-08 00:32:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets Dallas' opponent next week was going to be a "Sophie's Choice" regardless. Either the Giants' D or Rodgers. Detroit was a fraud
818252137876615168 2017-01-08 00:24:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer Also, no one ever mentions the fact that Wade Phillips TOLD his players to get out of town for the weekend and relax.

818251756912123907 2017-01-08 00:23:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer They all did, eh? Romo was the only one criticized & still is to this day about something that had nothing to do with the loss.
818251222885011456 2017-01-08 00:21:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Possibly, but I think he jumped too soon.
818250701033848834 2017-01-08 00:19:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris True, but he still mis-played it.
818250314319011845 2017-01-08 00:17:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson OBJ also played the throw poorly.
818250147431907328 2017-01-08 00:16:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade It was ridiculously stupid from an optics standpoint, but no....it's not having an effect on this game.

818243455335989248 2017-01-08 23:50:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers 2) Rodgers is playing well, but their D is beat up. Dallas' O would be able to play ball control & keep Rodgers on the sideline.
818239277578522624 2017-01-08 23:33:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @corbydavidson I've thought GB was a better matchup for Dallas, and I still do, regardless of Jordy's health.

818234026242768897 2017-01-08 23:12:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers 1) Giants D has shown they can slow down & stifle  Dallas' offense. It means Eli only has to make 2 or 3 plays for them to win.

816478771893174272 2017-01-03 02:58:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Well, then you give me a solution. The GOP engaged in this crap for 8 years, and not only wasn't punished, but was REWARDED.
816477263013277696 2017-01-03 02:52:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy As would I, but we are where we are thanks to the GOP.

816381534135406593 2017-01-03 20:31:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @hillonfire2 @mikefinger The problem of lack of accountability. You think he did nothing wrong. He shattered a girl's face.
816380113298157569 2017-01-03 20:26:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @hillonfire2 @mikefinger You are correct, though, that it wasn't domestic abuse. It was just straight-up assault.
816379907043229696 2017-01-03 20:25:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @hillonfire2 @mikefinger You (and people like you) believing he did nothing wrong is a big part of the problem.
816367480562208768 2017-01-03 19:35:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm Fantastic recovery, but why did he crash inside and try to shoot that gap to begin with?
816365858385723392 2017-01-03 19:29:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @hookem_texas @St3v0_24 I only saw you criticizing his recruiting accumen over recruits that had already moved on from Texas.
816359761981607936 2017-01-03 19:05:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher And in retirement, he's been a red-dumbass.....
816359048551530498 2017-01-03 19:02:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher He's shown himself to be the same red-ass in retirement that he was as a player.
816358023123832832 2017-01-03 18:58:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @hookem_texas @St3v0_24 The problem is your Herman criticism here has no basis for it
816357771759206400 2017-01-03 18:57:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @St3v0_24 @MBHORNSFAN I wouldn't say 95%, but because of season/coaching change as well as dad pushing Stanford he was more Stanford than UT
816354784542420993 2017-01-03 18:45:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @St3v0_24 Yes, he was leaning heavy UT in the spring, but his dad was ALWAYS pushing Stanford, and then the season happened.
816354488692903936 2017-01-03 18:44:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @St3v0_24 Then wait to start throwing blame bombs until then as oppose to blaming him for recruits that had already moved on.
816352930228043776 2017-01-03 18:38:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @St3v0_24 You are putting the blame in entirely the wrong place. Herman had been the HC all of two weeks when Little committed.
816352229246562304 2017-01-03 18:35:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @St3v0_24 Herman didn't "miss or "lose" any of those players. You are misinformed.
816152720352706560 2017-01-02 05:22:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thereallisaann That guy should learn the meaning behind the phrase involving glass houses....yikes.

816145056730120192 2017-01-02 04:51:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot I would have wanted him gone IMMEDIATELY....and if he wasn't, I would DEMAND to know why!!
816144188840493056 2017-01-02 04:48:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger because he decided to address the topic by wishing Mixon well on his "2nd chance"
816141923022962689 2017-01-02 04:39:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @slmandel Too late....
816139206401658881 2017-01-02 04:28:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger I think his producer struck a nerve.
816138975408771074 2017-01-02 04:27:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival And sounds a little angry about it....
816137411348623361 2017-01-02 04:21:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NFL @crackerjack911 @02CarlosGarcia His 2nd chance didn't need to (and shouldn't have) include playing college or pro football.
816136627563139072 2017-01-02 04:18:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SInow Well-deserved. He did....

816132492952535040 2017-01-02 04:02:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josh_ellis11 Most years? No sir....  Maybe on the offensive side of the ball the majority of his years here, but certainly not on defense.

816128360099278848 2017-01-02 03:45:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @towershots Passionate? No, but he had ample time to prepare what he was going to say about this issue.
816127815007535104 2017-01-02 03:43:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @02CarlosGarcia People should be angry at both. If you believe the "punishment" he received was enough, that's your issue.
816126476378669056 2017-01-02 03:38:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @towershots Brent was trying to be positive & just went too far. It was a poor thing to say, but the anger is mis-directed.
816124921373986816 2017-01-02 03:31:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TomTheHerman @RobertoGreenpig He was not expelled. He was "suspended" for a year....a year used as a redshirt, according to the OU website.

815979709901271045 2017-01-02 17:54:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch Is it really? Especially considering the two a-holes involved? I'm shocked this didn't happen after Kiffin took the FAU job.
815979223915565056 2017-01-02 17:53:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SedanoESPN They're both guys that get the phrase "Eff that guy" directed at them quite a bit. Neither is exactly a ray of sunshine.
815955734655549440 2017-01-02 16:19:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast I'd love to see the wizardry involved in trying to make something work, cap-wise, because I don't think it exists.

815802316762808320 2017-01-01 06:10:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> Ok @dallascowboys fans....who do you want? Packers or Giants? Realistically, that's your choice. Detroit is a fraud. They won't beat Seattle
815792770606661632 2017-01-01 05:32:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> oh, I'm sure they'll pay him....because they have no choice.
815784286137839616 2017-01-01 04:58:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mrBobbyBones @Drew_11 The main obstacle to Tony going there is Lynch, I think.
815781458946195456 2017-01-01 04:47:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimCowlishaw Realistically, it was always going to be GB or NY.
815781236828499972 2017-01-01 04:46:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimCowlishaw Detroit has been a fraud all season, really. They won't beat Seattle and they wouldn't have beaten the Giants.
815780685285879812 2017-01-01 04:44:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast @ProFootballTalk Carr.....and I'm a @dallascowboys lifer.
815780356582473728 2017-01-01 04:42:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mrBobbyBones @Drew_11 Houston is stuck with Brock and that contract. Denver's situation just got real murky with Kubiak stepping down.
815778844754014208 2017-01-01 04:36:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Honestly, I would vote for Carr.
815776991236464640 2017-01-01 04:29:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AdamSchefter @TonyBrunoShow Doesn't look like it. Looks like he's retiring tomorrow.
815776488918228992 2017-01-01 04:27:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving I know this....  We should all be rooting like hell for Detroit next weekend.
815776088295088128 2017-01-01 04:25:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving The Giants D is playing out of their minds right now. I think Dallas matches up better with GB.
815775578976616448 2017-01-01 04:23:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Would you rather see the Giants D? I wouldn't.....
815770706785030144 2017-01-01 04:04:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> Cousins just isn't that guy. He's a decent NFL QB, but he's not top-level.

815634908760698880 2017-01-01 19:04:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving @WWMcClyde Yes, they did. I still disagree with it, though....
815634690719838217 2017-01-01 19:03:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @SheaInIrving True....good thing that's not what they're trying to trade.

814901809449992192 2016-12-30 18:31:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @toddarcher Moore was good when he was here.
814901718517485569 2016-12-30 18:31:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @toddarcher I said many times Dallas made a mistake by not tendering Moore when they had him.

813942509592252417 2016-12-27 02:59:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WhitlockJason The two situations aren't similar. Canseco named names with dates and meeting information.
813941806803062785 2016-12-27 02:57:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WhitlockJason Canseco also had evidence, because he was a supplier/connection.
813938742985625601 2016-12-27 02:44:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WhitlockJason I don't disagree. I'm not denying his credentials, but if you're going to make that claim, give something to support it.

813936326265466880 2016-12-27 02:35:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WhitlockJason No one is accusing him of lying, but if he gives nothing to support his claim, you can't lend a lot of credence to it either.
813935788727685121 2016-12-27 02:33:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WhitlockJason It's being ignored, because Karl gives nothing to support his claim. Literally nothing....

813929148884353024 2016-12-27 02:06:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @DanaHoule The only thing you said that was incorrect is that the article(s) is written as if it's claiming it's either/or.

813103560665759744 2016-12-25 19:26:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TylerPreston20 @FatWeddellSeal Because the new WHCOS released a Christmas statement that seemed like he was calling Trump a king.

810864270816772096 2016-12-19 15:08:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dpshow The main reason Dallas didn't put Tampa Bay yesterday was penalties. Dallas had 4 drives that ended in FG attempts due to penalties.
810863603070930944 2016-12-19 15:05:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dpshow Someone might want to remind @SheaInIrving that OL are tasked with pass protection as well as run blocking.

810721065370587137 2016-12-18 05:38:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Thank you for letting me know I should ignore your opinions on football in the future.
810706074097618944 2016-12-18 04:39:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving I'm not. I'm saying penalties were a MUCH bigger reason Dallas didn't put TB away than play-calling was, because it's true.
810704556556423168 2016-12-18 04:33:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving lol - Shea, you know more football than you let your schtick show, so just say it. How many drives did penalties kill? 5? 6?
810703403416453120 2016-12-18 04:28:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Did I say every play call was a good one? No, but the primary reason TB stayed in this game was penalties, and you KNOW it.
810703186222809088 2016-12-18 04:27:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @andrewperloff He was all over the entire game. His WRs just happened to bail him out in the 3rd quarter.
810702785385758720 2016-12-18 04:26:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving This is the NFL. A win is a win is a win.....period.
810702556661948417 2016-12-18 04:25:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Yeah, because he committed all those penalties. Just stop....
810701716748455936 2016-12-18 04:22:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KnowTheGame60 I honestly thought we were going to see a QB draw there.

810696587789864960 2016-12-18 04:01:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot Penalties are the reason this is still a game. Dallas has shot themselves in the foot all night with them.
810691215784112129 2016-12-18 03:40:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Dallas has stopped themselves. Tampa really hasn't stopped them yet.
810685845749501953 2016-12-18 03:19:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> Precisely. It was set up for a huge gain.
810684575236161536 2016-12-18 03:13:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tweetgrubes On that play, he was fine....the rest of the game? Different story....
810684090278088704 2016-12-18 03:12:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tweetgrubes Except he didn't do anything wrong....bad luck.
810678847083544576 2016-12-18 02:51:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr The penalty and the Dak taking a sack he shouldn't have set that up
810677555271495680 2016-12-18 02:46:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GeorgeTakei He's actually been one of the few sane, rational conservatives on the Russian hacking issue, which is frightening.

810673257837973508 2016-12-18 02:29:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Simple read....if you see the LBs split out from center, go. TB hasn't stopped Dallas yet. Dallas has stopped Dallas.

810608681289125893 2016-12-18 22:12:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher We also have no idea if Osweiler would have been better in Denver under Kubiak or not. He certainly was in the small sample we saw
810608311146053632 2016-12-18 22:10:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher You're correct about Rick Smith.
810608125946580993 2016-12-18 22:10:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher He decided Osweiler was only worth so much.
810607977329737728 2016-12-18 22:09:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher He didn't get outbid, though. He could have chosen to match, but he decided not to and let Brock walk.
810607431374016514 2016-12-18 22:07:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher You have a newborn. You're excused....hehehe.
810607260527370241 2016-12-18 22:06:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher The thing I retweeted that has you all hot and bothered never said Elway didn't offer. It just said he knows what he's doing.
810606330432069633 2016-12-18 22:03:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher He got $37M guaranteed. Denver offered $30M.
810605707221487620 2016-12-18 22:00:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher He also got more guaranteed money from Houston than Denver offered. Not as negligible as you think....
810605113970671620 2016-12-18 21:58:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher The Cowboys (almost) $21M backup is a backup due to injury, not because he sucks.
810604737414438912 2016-12-18 21:56:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher $8M over 4 years is negligible?
810604249646321665 2016-12-18 21:54:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher ......and it was less money.
810603966102913025 2016-12-18 21:53:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher If it was the same deal, why didn't Osweiller take it then?
810603430028972033 2016-12-18 21:51:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LATimesfarmer @bkaucher He still let him walk though. He wasn't willing to give him more than that.

809976566683987968 2016-12-16 04:20:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Official_MalikJ RUN!!!
809976492415447040 2016-12-16 04:20:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ride_Austin @ChrisMosser This sounds like a radio segment/bit just WAITING to happen. :)
809976169378488320 2016-12-16 04:19:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RickLeRula #Enabler
809974180355670016 2016-12-16 04:11:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Just turned it on....what happened? Oh, and yes, you're right to shudder. I've been seeing it personally for a few years now.
809964828404154368 2016-12-16 03:33:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SoonerSteve1 are you really trying to compare this to Joe Mixon smashing a girl's face in?
809964718333054976 2016-12-16 03:33:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SoonerSteve1 some of his players are of legal drinking age
809964628650364929 2016-12-16 03:33:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SoonerSteve1 That isn't illegal
809956336775655429 2016-12-16 03:00:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SoonerSteve1 I also don't believe Sark has been hit for a DWI
809956198145523712 2016-12-16 02:59:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SoonerSteve1 If he's sober, sure....
809941888652505088 2016-12-16 02:02:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SoonerSteve1 Mack Brown? Doubtful. Saban? Probably. His moral code doesn't extend far either. Urban? Probably. Look at Aaron Hernandez.
809933184817397760 2016-12-16 01:28:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SoonerSteve1 Right, but it was another school that gave him that chance. Stoops should have cut him loose and let someone else deal with it
809932880101212160 2016-12-16 01:27:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 Thank you for proving my point....if he wasn't good at football, he wouldn't have gotten off easy.
809931283203817472 2016-12-16 01:20:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 @IamMalaika2U I replied before I saw the 2nd tweet. Sorry....
809931074042261505 2016-12-16 01:19:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 Your justifications are simply sad.
809930963635568640 2016-12-16 01:19:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SoonerSteve1 And used that season as a redshirt year. The OU Football website says as much.
809930780482924545 2016-12-16 01:18:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SoonerSteve1 Pretty sure Bobby Petrino wasn't charged with DWI. Also, he lost his job at Arkansas over this.
809929729260355585 2016-12-16 01:14:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 @IamMalaika2U Huh?
809929498129006592 2016-12-16 01:13:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 @coopmavs @SoonerSteve1 He redshirted.....he wasn't really punished.
809929036629757952 2016-12-16 01:11:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 @coopmavs @SoonerSteve1 Again, was serious injury to another person caused as a result?
809928811894673408 2016-12-16 01:10:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 @coopmavs @SoonerSteve1 Did he seriously injure someone doing it?
809928676913586176 2016-12-16 01:10:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 What if that was your daughter/niece/etc whose face he smashed?
809928218061000704 2016-12-16 01:08:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 @coopmavs @SoonerSteve1 If a DWI results in serious injury to another person, then they shouldn't be allowed to play CFB either.
809927793840685056 2016-12-16 01:06:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 Go ahead....keep rationalizing.
809927579184545792 2016-12-16 01:05:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 Joe Mixon avoided any real punishment because he's good at football. If you're ok with that, again....that's on you.
809927215894974464 2016-12-16 01:04:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 If it doesn't matter to you that the coach of your football program has no ethics or moral code, that's on you.
809926333593767936 2016-12-16 01:01:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 So? That doesn't mean Stoops had to give him that 2nd chance, thereby debasing himself & forfeiting his credibility as a man
809924723836649473 2016-12-16 00:54:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 ooooo.....I bet that really showed him.
809924385196933120 2016-12-16 00:53:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg Prepare yourself for disappointment....
809924144720736256 2016-12-16 00:52:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 He basically redshirted. Big eff-ing deal....he should never have been allowed to be on the team. Period.
809923679681413121 2016-12-16 00:50:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith One could also describe certain foods and adult beverages in that way.
809923393256570880 2016-12-16 00:49:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bdub2283 @coopmavs But no....Bob Stoops has no real moral code, so he still got to play.
809923129803997184 2016-12-16 00:48:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @bdub2283 Playing college football is a privilege. He forfeited that when he smashed that girl's face.

809910284563476481 2016-12-16 23:57:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> I just got blocked by @OU_CoachStoops for pointing out that he apparently has no shame or moral code. I feel better now....
809904599008210945 2016-12-16 23:34:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean He sat out and used that as a redshirt. That's not a punishment.

809903068414377984 2016-12-16 23:28:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodbabers An @NFL team shouldn't even have an option. @nflcommish could suspend him indefinitely should a team want to draft/sign him.
809902148293115907 2016-12-16 23:24:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rodbabers The whole OU Admin (including Castiglione & Stoops) saw it, and yet they still allowed him to stay at OU and play football.
809901062287228928 2016-12-16 23:20:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @corbydavidson And the fact the @OU_CoachStoops still allowed him to remain on the team is inexcusable....

809897105879891968 2016-12-16 23:04:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> Hey @NFL & @nflcommish...want to send a message about domestic violence? Tell your teams that @Joe_MainMixon isn't welcome in your league.
809896364012347392 2016-12-16 23:01:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> I've seen the footage of the @Joe_MainMixon incident. It confirms what I thought after hearing about it. @OU_CoachStoops should be ashamed.

808503526984974336 2016-12-12 02:47:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoogFans @mikefinger @DakotaSoTrill @Swestfall No one said it was, but the UT Ath Dept operates in the black consistently.
808502086484762625 2016-12-12 02:41:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillBaizer @CoreyElliot Both are valid opinions and stances....
808501458668834818 2016-12-12 02:39:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Swestfall @mikefinger @DakotaSoTrill @CoogFans You guys should really try to know what you're talking about before engaging in a discussion
808500646911635456 2016-12-12 02:35:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ColemanESPN I know high school OCs that could do a better job then Fisher.
808499455305674752 2016-12-12 02:31:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jbarro Josh, your point here lacks logic....
808478563057987584 2016-12-12 01:08:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump This statement is ridiculously wrong. Also...HACKING WAS BROUGHT UP DURING ONE OF YOUR DEBATES YOU MEGALOMANAICAL JACKASS!!
808465187724558336 2016-12-12 00:14:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger C'mon, Mike....he's a Coog High fan. What do you expect?
808435949084479488 2016-12-12 22:18:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jakebeckman I've read a couple of things from current/former staffers that says calling home office is more effective.
808435369771409408 2016-12-12 22:16:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm This is one of a lengthy list of things that DFW sports fans can't handle.
808434747319975940 2016-12-12 22:13:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jakebeckman You should post the number to the home office in his district.
808434475440996352 2016-12-12 22:12:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Especially considering no one was buying....
808434016076660736 2016-12-12 22:11:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aseitzwald @DAVEINYOURCAVE MAKE IT RAIN!!!!
808432891759890432 2016-12-12 22:06:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Is your collection of sharp knives out in plain sight at your place? #ThinkingOutLoud
808431786149769216 2016-12-12 22:02:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Anything involving the Cowboys gets exponentially blown out of proportion.
808431067476672512 2016-12-12 21:59:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @ColemanESPN LOTS of media (not just Dallas) love to try to create controversy/news where none exists...Low-brow journalism
808429746031906816 2016-12-12 21:54:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @mavshomer This....  The offense was just fine on Thanksgiving.
808429444297879554 2016-12-12 21:52:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BON_SBNation @SBN_Wescott And rightly so....Texas gains nothing by scheduling them.
808429002834714627 2016-12-12 21:51:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Precisely. Texas gains nothing by scheduling UH.
808423709929275392 2016-12-12 21:30:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HunterYurachek @Joseph_Duarte @fahds___ Keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better.
808423527657390080 2016-12-12 21:29:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Dez was bad last night....Dak was worse....and criticism is deserved, but it was one game.
808412573028810752 2016-12-12 20:45:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HunterYurachek @Joseph_Duarte Anyone that think UT is "scared" of UH is not living in reality.
808412063781502977 2016-12-12 20:43:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris lol, the "their way" comment is BS political grandstanding. The GOP had a significant say in how the rates currently are.
808411747509997568 2016-12-12 20:42:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidCornDC @sherrodharris Neither the chart nor the rates are complex, but the overall tax code is very complex & needs simplification.
808410523213688832 2016-12-12 20:37:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CBSSports @chrisgb00 I'll believe it when I see it.
808410432339869696 2016-12-12 20:37:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I find the "their way" claim hilarious as well...
808410127661461504 2016-12-12 20:36:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Reuters Took him long enough....
808401105889742848 2016-12-12 20:00:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Which no one will....
808399857484525573 2016-12-12 19:55:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ApolloBlaQ Well, since you refuse to say his name, apparently....which QB were you referring to? If I was incorrect, that is....
808398886779883520 2016-12-12 19:51:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ApolloBlaQ That's not what your tweet said. You said Romo had never gone 11-2 in his career in one season.
808395854386233344 2016-12-12 19:39:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @ApolloBlaQ This is also incorrect. 2007....hello?
808395571920773120 2016-12-12 19:38:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Well, the vote would happen first, then the lawyers and guns. I was asking because I honestly don't know what their options are.
808393788695674880 2016-12-12 19:31:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Your thoughts? Are they allowed to vote for anyone or are they restricted to a short list of some kind?https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/808372552238243842
808341610685726720 2016-12-12 16:03:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChipBrownHD @thatsean If you blow a 4Q lead then come back & win that shouldn't count as a comeback. You can't pitch your way into a save.
808340295632977920 2016-12-12 15:58:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong @Official_MalikJ @HaileeStrong1 My condolences on the passing of your dad. He will always be with us in spirit.
808330579238420484 2016-12-12 15:20:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Thought you would appreciate part of this, at least.... ^^^
808327806899879938 2016-12-12 15:09:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> Sad day, but we knew it was coming....@ChuckFnStrong #RIPhttps://twitter.com/ChuckFnStrong/status/808099360269541376
808205131867189248 2016-12-11 07:01:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ForTheWin @BarkingCarnival @JetSweeps I award you no points, and may God have mercy on  your soul.
808192124852334592 2016-12-11 06:09:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets You're correct, but you can be critical when it's deserved. The trick is....knowing the difference.
808191526371295232 2016-12-11 06:07:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattmosley Dez wasn't good. Dak was worse. He's been getting the praise, so he gets the criticism too. It's deserved & comes w/the position
808191003047903232 2016-12-11 06:05:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @ForTheWin This is one of the most inane, unintelligent, illogical things I've ever read.
808189862981619712 2016-12-11 06:00:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CNN @NBCNightlyNews @realDonaldTrump Please, expand on that. Tell us, exactly, how they are inaccurate and biased....if you can.
808189205654503428 2016-12-11 05:58:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MontyPulido @BryanBroaddus @J0HNBECKETT This is absolutely comical....
808187563928354816 2016-12-11 05:51:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattmosley No he wasn't
808187111933349888 2016-12-11 05:49:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BryanBroaddus Beyond that, why Dak wouldn't tuck the ball and run tonight when things weren't there was maddening.
808185559998955520 2016-12-11 05:43:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> I blame myself for tonight. I didn't doubt/challenge the @dallascowboys before the game.
808184703920603136 2016-12-11 05:40:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> Cowboys twitter is drunk & angry and needs to put the phone/computer away for the night.
808184364710461440 2016-12-11 05:39:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @YRpbrinegar I am.....you're the one ignoring what actually happend.
808184220988407808 2016-12-11 05:38:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @YRpbrinegar He threw for 301 yards and 3 TDs against the Ravens. He didn't struggle against MIN. Penalties killed drives.
808183851449196544 2016-12-11 05:37:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @YRpbrinegar And you have no evidence to back up this opinion.....
808183128804257792 2016-12-11 05:34:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @YRpbrinegar Really? Is this the only good defense Dallas has faced this year? No....it's not.
808182827036577792 2016-12-11 05:32:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @YRpbrinegar He was bad tonight.....no question about that, but to say he's the weak link because of one game is simply asinine
808182368964059137 2016-12-11 05:31:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @YRpbrinegar So what? You don't take the stats away just because he's not the RB.
808181885155344384 2016-12-11 05:29:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs Precisely....the D was not good on Thanksgiving
808181569739427840 2016-12-11 05:27:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @YRpbrinegar HAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA.....you're drunk, dude.
808180769281769472 2016-12-11 05:24:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @YRpbrinegar Oh, also...in the 195-yard game, he ran for 39 yards and a TD. How was that a poor game again?
808180506311397376 2016-12-11 05:23:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @YRpbrinegar That 195 was in a win where he went 17-24 and the offense scored 31 points. How was that a poor game?
808179616309452800 2016-12-11 05:20:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> Dak looked like a rookie tonight. The Giants D confused him and his throws were off-target (cold maybe?). Hopefully it's an abberation....
808177993701031936 2016-12-11 05:13:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @1053SS Not when you look at more than just yardage totals....
808177261920788480 2016-12-11 05:10:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SpanningTheLoeb You get the praise, but you also get the heat. It comes with the position. He was terrible tonight.
808177001987248128 2016-12-11 05:09:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GreatDonovan The offense sputtered last week mainly because of penalties. They would get a drive going....penalty....drive killed.
808176584381362176 2016-12-11 05:08:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @richarddeitsch @RealSkipBayless If you don't give the idiots with microphones oxygen, they can't breathe.
808175892132466690 2016-12-11 05:05:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gjspittle We focus on Dak because he's the QB, and he was terrible tonight. The 2nd INT was overthrown by 5 yards into double-coverage.
808168225812914176 2016-12-11 04:34:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @wingoz They have a shot. I wouldn't call it decent.
808167995596042240 2016-12-11 04:33:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SandlerJ @1053thefan He just wasn't reading the field well, and wouldn't tuck and run when things weren't there.
808166265642684416 2016-12-11 04:27:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BryanBroaddus He does, but that was one bad play. Big one, but still one. Dak has been bad all night.
808165298562023424 2016-12-11 04:23:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> Bad QB play and bad coaching decisions will cost you games.
808164784755576832 2016-12-11 04:21:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> Dak finally makes an on-target throw to Dez and he fumbles it. TERRIBLE ball security. The ball wasn't even hit on the tackle.
808162900510736384 2016-12-11 04:13:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rickyprep He's been open. Dak has just missed him. This is on Dak tonight. He's been terrible.
808162608775827456 2016-12-11 04:12:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Dak has looked like a rookie tonight. Just awful....
808162212707762176 2016-12-11 04:11:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets Dak is refusing to run the ball tonight
808161494332571648 2016-12-11 04:08:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BryanBroaddus They're good, but not this good. Dak has been inept tonight.
808157149901815808 2016-12-11 03:50:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> Dak is playing terrible football tonight....
808153082064498688 2016-12-11 03:34:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving No, they're not.
808140472740966400 2016-12-11 02:44:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade *Hes
808140408266063872 2016-12-11 02:44:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade It's not his. His a minority investor/owner, and they have mentioned that fact numerous times in the past.
808139378438574080 2016-12-11 02:40:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo He's an investor, not the owner. However, they have mentioned it in the past.
808138161578799104 2016-12-11 02:35:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr He also had an escape route to his right
808137845718196225 2016-12-11 02:34:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr um, what?
808090664974032896 2016-12-11 23:26:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Sam_Vecenie Unless you find sauerkraut to be disgusting, that is....
808076255232978945 2016-12-11 22:29:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jeff_Caplan I'm honestly curious if she's ever actually heard Spencer speak....
808074308971073536 2016-12-11 22:21:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jeff_Caplan If by interesting you mean laughable....
808065104478695424 2016-12-11 21:45:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith I would say that is a common feeling in this situation.
807829893610348544 2016-12-10 06:10:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps Damn....color me jealous
807786243937435648 2016-12-10 03:17:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones Apparently it's a movie about a t-shirt and the guy who made it....not the game itself.
807779465497546752 2016-12-10 02:50:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones You can dislike both sides. In this situation, it's real easy....
807776138953105408 2016-12-10 02:36:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ringer Don't give her oxygen and she'll suffocate. She's a female Alex Jones, and like Alex....she's best left ignored.
807771382973169664 2016-12-10 02:18:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Browning & Foreman should have been the instead of Westbrook & Peppers

807672856591159296 2016-12-10 19:46:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Alyssa_Milano @jonfavs @friedo1033 sounds like you're blaming the victims instead of the perpetrators....
807654283734814720 2016-12-10 18:32:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @friedo1033 I disgree for a number of reasons & believe that a re-vote (which won't happen) would be a HRC electoral & popular win.
807649516396707840 2016-12-10 18:13:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @friedo1033 All of them? No. Would it silence some of them? Yes, if the results looked legitimate, which they currently don't.
807648885405577216 2016-12-10 18:11:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones which coaches are you referring to? Briles was not a very popular guy among Texas HS coaches that actually dealt with him
807648039968055297 2016-12-10 18:07:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @friedo1033 and you're right, you never said who you voted for....my apologies for assuming
807647922032672768 2016-12-10 18:07:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @friedo1033 your assertion that people should just "move on" under these circumstances is very naive
807647510424616964 2016-12-10 18:05:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @friedo1033 Just "move on"? A foreign gov't & the FBI interfered with & influenced our election & you want us to "move on"?
807646443662168065 2016-12-10 18:01:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @friedo1033 well, you most definitely voted for the wrong person to do that
807644744239185920 2016-12-10 17:54:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @friedo1033 And yes, they're calling the result illegitimate because a foreign gov't & the FBI interfered & influenced it
807644061838360577 2016-12-10 17:52:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @friedo1033 They condemned him for saying he wouldn't accept the results (if he lost) before the election even took place.
807642943687258112 2016-12-10 17:47:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateSilver538 What strategy could they possibly have had in place for something like that? Your premise that they should have lacks logic.
807642463804461056 2016-12-10 17:45:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateSilver538 How exactly, does one respond to the FBI inserting itself into the election & a foreign gov't actively helping your opponent?
807640917498728448 2016-12-10 17:39:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @friedo1033 You may be right...you may not be, but at least the new result would have a much better chance to be legitimate
807634204045361152 2016-12-10 17:12:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @friedo1033 You do understand WHY there are people calling for this, right?

807358533457080320 2016-12-09 22:57:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @nytimes @WWMcClyde You are correct about how disgusting this is. There are MUCH better ways to protest bad legislation.

807302313631223812 2016-12-09 19:14:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris It's one thing to go play a game there. It's another to have a franchise there.
807301628118401024 2016-12-09 19:11:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris The problem there is security, IMO....
807301120360120320 2016-12-09 19:09:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin It probably was, but Kiffin wouldn't budge in buyout, so they went with major....don't you think?

807254374393249792 2016-12-09 16:03:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckCarltonDMN Translation: Kiffin either wanted too much money or wouldn't agree to a ridiculously high buyout clause.

806582376755318788 2016-12-07 19:33:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Official_MalikJ @dyanceyd I'm talking about the demographic shift of the two parties, which fundamentally changed after 1964.
806582038270738432 2016-12-07 19:31:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Official_MalikJ @dyanceyd Around 1964 they became Republicans. Why? Due to the Civil Rights Act pushed through by LBJ w/o southern Dems (2)
806581261397540866 2016-12-07 19:28:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Official_MalikJ @dyanceyd Since you apparently need a history lesson, here you go....white supremacists WERE Democrats until about 1964 (1)
806579937805275136 2016-12-07 19:23:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Official_MalikJ @dyanceyd LOL - If the tinfoil hat fits, brother....

806374948390453250 2016-12-06 05:49:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Official_MalikJ @dyanceyd And I'm sure you have proof of this, right?

805961147182628864 2016-12-05 02:24:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Garrett_Greene The only perspective you'll get that has any value is that Texas went 5-7. No other reason makes any logical sense.
805958881138642945 2016-12-05 02:15:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 you should have asked for a detailed list of which bowls so that you could tweet the coaches to warm them in advance.
805958022577143808 2016-12-05 02:12:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kbohls Westbrook shouldn't be in there either

805946327368695809 2016-12-05 01:25:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Well done, my brother.
805945228461010945 2016-12-05 01:21:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Yeah, Peppers being in is idiotic as well.
805944790038835200 2016-12-05 01:19:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I'm not saying he should win, but him not even being top 5 is ri-goddamn-diculous.
805943672625831936 2016-12-05 01:15:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal His numbers make it pretty easy to bang the table for him.

805889573955969024 2016-12-05 21:40:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TIPTowTexas Without question....
805854871069065216 2016-12-05 19:22:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> If you believe it's even a possibility that the Clintons are/were part of a child sex-trafficking ring, you're a special kind of stupid.
805851728495149057 2016-12-05 19:09:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Doing interviews just for appearances is a waste of time IMO. If you already know who you want when you fire someone, hire them.

805287009984086016 2016-12-03 05:45:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWetzel Right....a team Ohio St and Michigan both beat.
805286678365687809 2016-12-03 05:44:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd @sherrodharris Podcast....tomorrow....the 3 of us on the CFB playoff!!
805286496357978112 2016-12-03 05:43:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd @sherrodharris lol

805286212617596928 2016-12-03 05:42:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd @sherrodharris All 5 power 5 conf champs,then next 3 highest ranked teams.
805285552627089408 2016-12-03 05:40:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @craigfloyd Agreed....mid-October at the earliest.
805285377590366208 2016-12-03 05:39:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd @sherrodharris This is my argument for 8-team playoff. 8 is perfect.
805285209218416640 2016-12-03 05:38:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd @sherrodharris I don't think you need to remove the names, you just have to look at the whole resume.
805283544679456769 2016-12-03 05:32:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @craigfloyd You would have to show me the rest of Georgia's and Alabama's resumes in this made-up scenario, because....maybe.
805282573396086784 2016-12-03 05:28:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd @sherrodharris Exactly, Sherrod. It's the whole resume.
805282058985684993 2016-12-03 05:26:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd and they blew out Penn St....
805281619170967552 2016-12-03 05:24:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean @craigfloyd Ok, then put in Michigan.
805281349879861248 2016-12-03 05:23:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean So does Penn State's 2nd loss.
805281006508974080 2016-12-03 05:22:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean Penn State - 2 losses, Ohio State - 1 loss....both had very similar strength of schedule.
805279945228435456 2016-12-03 05:17:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @craigfloyd Conf Champs matters if you're talking about teams with similar resumes. Not so here....
805279478154936320 2016-12-03 05:16:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean So you're saying USC's losses shouldn't count?
805278567097651200 2016-12-03 05:12:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GregSwindell Nope....
805278472914563072 2016-12-03 05:12:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @craigfloyd Shouldn't have lost to Pitt then....

804913222813892608 2016-12-02 05:00:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasMBB @tj_ford Could be a big early-season turning point.....if they build on it.

804845440780955648 2016-12-02 00:31:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TIPTowTexas No, because if they get past the Giants next week and clinch early, they will probably drop one of their last couple of games

804537769888542721 2016-12-01 04:08:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Yup, they missed that one. Had to rewind, but I saw it.
804533425898196993 2016-12-01 03:51:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I don't disagree, but the hold on Free and the two penalties on Escobar were VERY questionable.
804532726451814400 2016-12-01 03:48:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> Dallas penalties....some very questionable....are why they are losing.
804529645773344769 2016-12-01 03:36:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMN_George @dmn_cowboys HORRIBLE job by Free.....
804529223704735745 2016-12-01 03:34:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr "holding" penalty
804529014085996544 2016-12-01 03:33:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JC1053 @1053thefan I never saw a hold....
804527803815366657 2016-12-01 03:29:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dpshow @richeisen @PaulPabst @SheaInIrving A couple of BS penalties have helped stymie the Dallas offense as well.
804527659778711552 2016-12-01 03:28:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dpshow @richeisen @PaulPabst @SheaInIrving Best defense they've faced all season....by a wide margin.
804524919837130753 2016-12-01 03:17:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers If Dez had bothered to block it might have gone somewhere

804524621756239872 2016-12-01 03:16:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr bad call

804502091939057668 2016-12-01 01:47:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MrChrisArnold @1053thefan @EzekielElliott It was a fumble, but there was a clear recovery by 'Zeke.
804498843823915008 2016-12-01 01:34:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> Minnesota gets away with hitting Dak in the face on 3rd down and forces an incompletion. Dallas punts....
804496625162973185 2016-12-01 01:25:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> On the road vs the best defense they've faced all season & the @dallascowboys defense is missing 3 starters...I'm concerned. Prove me wrong.
804445881835454464 2016-12-01 22:03:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade @1053SS Give me Dallas, 20-17...

804084552335495168 2016-11-30 22:07:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @miguelevision Not surprising and it's the best decision for him, honestly....

804017820191387648 2016-11-30 17:42:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> I cast my Heisman ballot for D'Onta Foreman! Click the player you think deserves the @NissanUSA #HeismanHouse vote! https://cards.twitter.com/cards/xzv67/2ndjb

804016407142957057 2016-11-30 17:37:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger He wouldn't win the Heisman next year anyway, because he wouldn't get NEAR the amount of carries he got this season.
803973053617242113 2016-11-30 14:44:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dpshow @HiMyNameIsSeton @PaulPabst @andrewperloff If Dallas clinches early, Romo will play. He won't start, but he will play.

803804271330332672 2016-11-29 03:34:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @WWMcClyde @JetSweeps Ah yes, let's debate calling for Shaka's head in year 2 with a team dominated my Freshmen & sophomores....
803789792924303360 2016-11-29 02:36:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @JetSweeps UTA is a good basketball team
803773491707191296 2016-11-29 01:31:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I don't know if OSU would beat Wisconsin
803752101637746692 2016-11-29 00:06:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Good Lord that was a funny last half hour....
803720629920956416 2016-11-29 22:01:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> To answer your question though....a 3-win improvement from season 1 to season 2, including a win over the #11 team in the country.

803715814008516608 2016-11-29 21:42:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He, allegedly, wanted about $5M/year to deal with cleaning up that mess, and Baylor said no. Oh well....good for Chad.
803715183038398464 2016-11-29 21:40:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> All the Longhorn websites have their pros & cons, but currently, no one has better inside info on the team or recruiting than @InsideTexas.

803347173408669696 2016-11-28 21:17:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aboedeker @SportsSturm I would want $5+ million/yr to try and fix that dumpster fire too. It's a much bigger fix than most people realize.

803027211271868416 2016-11-27 00:06:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I have no doubt the game will eventually return, but without an apology, you won't hear me champion it.
803026970824978432 2016-11-27 00:05:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy It is a business, and Texas doesn't need A&M to create great/successful business. They. Can. Fuck. Off.

801952332539891712 2016-11-24 00:55:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Not saying everything is perfect, but to say there's "massive" dysfunction is a massive overstatement
801951889596313601 2016-11-24 00:53:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott A list of things....
801951343808315392 2016-11-24 00:51:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott You are over-stating the level of "dysfunction"

801941062021484548 2016-11-24 00:10:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> Hey @DeanBlandino & @NFL, does a WAS DB have to hit someone with a blackjack before you'll throw a flag?? Did you bring in #Big12Refs today?

801796625962246144 2016-11-24 14:36:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Winning team will score in the 30s today, IMO....
801795242005561345 2016-11-24 14:30:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal leave off the why do, sorry... Voice texting
801795143770734594 2016-11-24 14:30:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal why do you have ridiculous betting will power if you resist that over under
801794493401989120 2016-11-24 14:27:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal what is the over under at right now for that game? I think the DAL-WAS game is going to be like the DAL-PIT game...High scoring
801793329063202816 2016-11-24 14:23:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal take the over on DAL-WAS

801300813733855232 2016-11-22 05:46:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jason_Higdon @Taylor_Estes_ @HornsDigest Simple answer.... No....
801300543280910336 2016-11-22 05:45:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade Which one.....tell me.
801296781820698624 2016-11-22 05:30:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal ?
801296736987860993 2016-11-22 05:30:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal College hoops, in general, sure....but early-season college hoops.
801291936283951105 2016-11-22 05:10:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal This is why one should avoid it....
801163678137647104 2016-11-22 20:41:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @drafthouse @AnnaKendrick47 If only any tickets were still available....  My dinner & karaoke night dream date with you will have to wait.
801131599416803329 2016-11-22 18:33:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cnnbrk Hey @KellyannePolls & @realDonaldTrump....YOU CAN'T PURSUE ANY TYPE OF INVESTIGATION!!! YOU DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY!!! #Idiot
801115098987147264 2016-11-22 17:28:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 This month.... Hell, this year.....
801075408925929472 2016-11-22 14:50:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm I'm much more concerned about the defense for Thursday.
801074846536908800 2016-11-22 14:48:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jonmachota @dmn_cowboys @1053thefan I actually agree with this. He would be a better backup RB option than Morris, IMO.
800921043372298241 2016-11-21 04:37:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher They were both bad spots. I agree. I'm saying a challenge of the 3rd down call would have almost assuredly been successful.
800920509131145216 2016-11-21 04:35:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher 2nd one wasn't as obvious....
800920051935113216 2016-11-21 04:33:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher Houston got effed on spots on back to back plays. O'Brien should have challenged the play before, though. It was more obvious....
800914153275736064 2016-11-21 04:09:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Ok, that's ridiculous
800913721598103556 2016-11-21 04:08:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS @Bitterwhiteguy Good call or no?
800910728224002048 2016-11-21 03:56:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @andrewperloff Still significant w/o being ridiculous.
800910532941381632 2016-11-21 03:55:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @andrewperloff I've been saying for a while now that PI should be a 25-yd maximum.
800895462731550721 2016-11-21 02:55:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade Quite possibly....especially with Watt back.
800579943277043712 2016-11-20 06:01:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal He's 49 (almost 50) and he's in pretty ridiculous shape....

800547520355110912 2016-11-20 03:52:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StevieVanZandt @TimCowlishaw Under normal circumstances, I would agree.....but these aren't normal circumstances.
800546409460154368 2016-11-20 03:48:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimCowlishaw @dmeredith17 "Stick to sports" guy should probably stay off Twitter.
800543740314218496 2016-11-20 03:37:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWENetwork @WWE I was charged for November, but when I tried to login for #SurvivorSeries I was told I had no acct associated with my email
800541705762205697 2016-11-20 03:29:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWE @RealMickFoley I would love to be watching it, but http://wwe.com apparently erased my acct even though I was charged for Nov.
800531891535433728 2016-11-20 02:50:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Excellent decision....
800518501370736640 2016-11-20 01:57:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Sam_Vecenie No one within the University is doing this.
800518148982116352 2016-11-20 01:56:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN Texas has never fired a coach during the season. Why would they start now?
800513096720777217 2016-11-20 01:36:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mr_blah_blah__ @EricNahlin Twitter is too limiting for this discussion, lol....
800510869943832577 2016-11-20 01:27:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mr_blah_blah__ @EricNahlin Insatiable media and impatient BMDs who can't stand it when thing don't happen when and how they want it to.
800507538982596609 2016-11-20 01:14:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @billmcraven @WWMcClyde Seems to me it's some people who have influence within (but aren't employed by) @UTAustin who are causing this.
799890115120287744 2016-11-19 08:20:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @payne_sullins @miakhalifa We know what you want to wreck..... ;)
799858326943178752 2016-11-18 06:14:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanCBass @Bitterwhiteguy We've reached new levels of stupid, and yet I am confident those levels will be bested before the weekend is out.
799856676245557248 2016-11-18 06:07:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Carpophores @WillMcAvoyACN He accused you of presenting a false dichotomy as he was simultaneously presenting a false equivalency. Ironic.
799849475934142464 2016-11-18 05:39:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @pjsulls16 @WillMcAvoyACN Exactly....didn't happen. Plain and simple. That's been debunked numerous times.

799847819586797568 2016-11-18 05:32:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Carpophores @WillMcAvoyACN I'll let Will handle this. I actually understood his point.
799845294141833216 2016-11-18 05:22:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN @Carpophores I know precisely what it is. Your insinuation is that Will is presenting one when he's actually pointing one out

799368954280034304 2016-11-17 21:49:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @AlanKestrel750 Bernie was always wrong on this issue anyway. Federal minimum wage doesn't need to be $15/hr.
799368346542149633 2016-11-17 21:47:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @minor757 I won't go that far, but I will speak up against outright falsehoods.
799367101991583744 2016-11-17 21:42:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @minor757 Hillary Clinton didn't murder anyone. You, and everyone who says this, are 100% wrong.

799337267571474432 2016-11-17 19:43:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CharlesRobinson @clarencehilljr Um, no he doesn't. He doesn't have to say anything of the kind....but Jerry just can't help himself.
799336908757184512 2016-11-17 19:42:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade @jonmachota As I said earlier, Jerry is physically incapable of just shutting the fuck up.

799327178785554432 2016-11-17 19:03:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm @pumpfake78 A pro athlete asking (key word there) for a chance to compete (another key word) for your job is not a selfish act.
799269320136294400 2016-11-17 15:13:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @timkeaney I didn't know, but also didn't think it was. I just found it funny.
799134965917249536 2016-11-16 06:19:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @ahammsportsgeek Did he really just do that?? Durant looked like he was ready to go. The Warriors should talk to the league.

799002666349293568 2016-11-16 21:34:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I'm all for getting the electoral college back to functioning the way in which it was designed, which it currently is not.
799001658659368960 2016-11-16 21:30:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde So, the first step is getting rid of those.
799000563019108352 2016-11-16 21:25:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Well, this constitutional process has already been jacked up due to a lot of state legislatures passing winner-take-all laws.
799000135384567812 2016-11-16 21:24:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde There are positives and negatives to this, but I see where you're coming from.
798997502120763392 2016-11-16 21:13:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @nytopinion I don't think it needs to removed, but it definitely needs adjusting.

798741594820280325 2016-11-15 04:16:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedemrich If Tony is going to be the backup, don't you need to try and get him reps? He's had zero....

798694364507754496 2016-11-15 01:09:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm @cowboycomputer This is such a silly opinion.... (Not you, Bob)

798693325889015809 2016-11-15 01:05:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedemrich Thoughts?
798692333671895040 2016-11-15 01:01:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @swish41 I know this is old, but I still love it....
798689824567951361 2016-11-15 00:51:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedemrich (2/2) Dak hasn't dealt with the short week yet, plus they have 3 games in 11 days. Perfect game to play Tony.
798689513941987329 2016-11-15 00:49:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedemrich My thought is, let Tony handle the Thanksgiving game against Washington, which he can kind of prep for now (1/2).
798688906833260544 2016-11-15 00:47:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tedemrich Without question, I think. I just wish they could get him game reps somewhere, and I have a theory about that....

798394185988632576 2016-11-14 05:16:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimCowlishaw @NotEdKaul Also, the Pats went 3-1 w/o him. Missing a quarter of the season plus the Pats record w/o him should mean no MVP.

798170386135453696 2016-11-14 14:27:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm Is Darren McFadden healthy, but hasn't been activated due to roster inflexibility? I feel he'd be a better option than Morris.
798034889966616576 2016-11-13 05:28:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I tend to agree, which is why I want Dallas to find a way to get Romo game reps and have him back starting for the playoffs.

796810973218766848 2016-11-10 20:25:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GeorgeTakei The one thing I disagree with in your statement, George, is....don't deny them their say, just make sure they get shouted down.
796801636568092672 2016-11-10 19:48:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mexico @RealDonalDrumpf @intlspectator As the title of the @alfranken book said "Lies...and the Lying Liars That Tell Them"

796799366677889024 2016-11-10 19:39:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @morninggloria On the end of #3, you forgot to add (while still considering #1)

796635784375889920 2016-11-10 08:49:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Better ;)
796615607408066561 2016-11-09 07:28:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Ain't nothing stopping you right now, lol.....just keep it on the DL
796614497339326464 2016-11-09 07:24:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris California, for sure....don't know if there were others.
796613599695372288 2016-11-09 07:20:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris That's why he undermined himself. Not voting for President? Fine, but not voting at all? Voting is your one sure change tool.
796610914942382080 2016-11-09 07:10:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris At least a little bit.....
796608025935089664 2016-11-09 06:58:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith I'm a Jewish? lol
796593792707084288 2016-11-09 06:02:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Sound like he was giving you a "pump you up" pre-game speech.
796584727822135296 2016-11-09 05:26:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Richard_Schiff @sarahkendzior It's @people. They're not journalists. They're a higher-end @usweekly. Celebrity puff-piece bullshit.
796583036615794688 2016-11-09 05:19:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JasonLaCanfora @TRongen I honestly don't know which is worse, but then....they just elected him President, so I guess it's the latter.
796572399235989504 2016-11-09 04:37:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Richard_Schiff @KFILE The media failed the public during this election cycle. One would hope they would try to make it up to us now.

796533394981187584 2016-11-09 02:02:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot That was brilliant....
796533346394341376 2016-11-09 02:02:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkravitz Out-STANDING!!!
796527932156051457 2016-11-09 01:40:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ProFootballTalk @kayleighmcenany McEnany & Lord are engaging in the highest levels of hypocrisy.
796523816809857025 2016-11-09 01:24:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kayleighmcenany @realJeffreyLord (2/2) And for you two to act like that didn't happen in a call for "unity" is the EPITOME of hypocrisy.
796523428417245186 2016-11-09 01:22:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kayleighmcenany @realJeffreyLord Your candidate stoked fear, racism, xenophobia, & division throughout the entirety of his campaign. (1/2)
796522934043115521 2016-11-09 01:20:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kayleighmcenany @realJeffreyLord Two white people telling minorities what they should and shouldn't be afraid of is utterly comical.
796515121967353856 2016-11-09 00:49:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde My heart hurts today, brother....not so much for myself, but for those I fear are now truly vulnerable....on both sides.
796510540650737665 2016-11-09 00:31:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I know. I'm not including you in my thoughts. I was just furthering the discussion. I was using "you" in the generic sense.
796506488055492608 2016-11-09 00:15:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Racism, misogyny, & xenophobia aren't positions. They're parts of who he is as a person and a potential leader. That's different.
796500841435897860 2016-11-09 23:52:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Of course they're not, but when you support someone who you know is like that, some of that stink gets on you too.
796487138003054592 2016-11-09 22:58:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I am not that easily swayed.
796475029789769728 2016-11-09 22:10:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I don't, but that also doesn't mean the category you're referring to doesn't exist, in large numbers, amomgst his voters.
796470772550275072 2016-11-09 21:53:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JuddApatow @RalphRoachJr Ralph, you are so misinformed, it's frightening. Even more frightening? You are FAR from the only one....
796461434607640580 2016-11-09 21:16:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots Yeah....he lost me with that.
796434964132855810 2016-11-09 19:31:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @maddow They aren't the primary culprit, but to say they bear no responsibility is also incorrect.
796428525863632910 2016-11-09 19:05:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Well, you hear something new every day. Learning? Not so much....downside to being an idiot. Thing don't stick....
796423804406956033 2016-11-09 18:46:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean I didn't say 'all'. I said 'some', and I hope we find out how many that 'some' amounted to.
796419948511952898 2016-11-09 18:31:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean Let's not dismiss the fact that some of those 47% were also prevented from voting.
796280697140826113 2016-11-09 09:18:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GirlfriendKim It was supposed to be a joke....not reality.
796280365673496576 2016-11-09 09:16:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Richard_Schiff My despair is consuming....I truly fear for our country now.
796280101105205248 2016-11-09 09:15:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JuddApatow He's too volatile to be a perfect vessel. It's part of why he's so dangerous.
796265705419239424 2016-11-09 08:18:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RedHourBen @pattonoswalt Tonight's outcome makes me question that....
796265219043590144 2016-11-09 08:16:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban The problem is Mark, as you know, he believes that he is bigger than us, and he'll try and crush anyone who dissents.
796261379292405760 2016-11-09 08:01:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> In my lifetime, I've never been more sad for, disappointed in, scared for, and just plain ashamed of my country as I am tonight.
796261121758003200 2016-11-09 08:00:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade @AnnCoulter Someone (Ann) doesn't know her history very well.

796260163170795520 2016-11-08 07:56:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> You're going to be hoping for a long time. That's who he is.....
796255858040651776 2016-11-08 07:39:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris What is there is reassess? Those that want to take this country backwards not only outnumber us, but now have all the power.
796252740989177856 2016-11-08 07:27:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I've never been more fearful for this country than I am tonight. I am going to give a serious look at emigrating.

796239632279203840 2016-11-08 06:34:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> You'll excuse me if I don't find solace in that....
796238883197485056 2016-11-08 06:31:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> You're right. Sometimes people use their vote to destroy the very thing that gave them that voice.
796229412844867589 2016-11-08 05:54:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban As am I.....I just may be one that now observes my home country from north of the border.

796118071262019584 2016-11-08 22:31:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @sherrodharris I agree and I have no problem with weed being legal. I was just stating why some Bernie millenials went there
796116528164958208 2016-11-08 22:25:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @Bitterwhiteguy Bernie supporters who turned towards Johnson did so for one reason....legal weed.

795385335559626752 2016-11-06 22:00:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @elkpga Um, the DOJ and the FBI aren't going anywhere. Unless you're implying the Trump will try and disband those two organizations....
795384966058221572 2016-11-06 21:58:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde The two issues, while connected, are also still separate.
795384788513329152 2016-11-06 21:58:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I don't disagree there.
795384326695383040 2016-11-06 21:56:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde You're correct, but it doesn't excuse the ridiculously poor handling of this ehole thing by Director Comey and the FBI.
795381309556359168 2016-11-06 21:44:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> .@POTUS I hope you plan to bring Dir. Comey to the WH on 11/9 for serious questions, and ask for his resignation without acceptable answers.

795366605555400706 2016-11-06 20:45:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Good....we should have seen him earlier.
795365767697092609 2016-11-06 20:42:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon @QuincyQuarry Not at all. You just insinuated that I was taking HRC at her word about things, which I'm not, so I corrected you.
795362901750120449 2016-11-06 20:31:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I think @POTUS may ask for his resignation on Nov. 9th
795362729569779714 2016-11-06 20:30:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dallascowboys @ColemanESPN That's the reason I was hoping he'd be ready to play this week. CLE is the perfect team to get some reps in.

795358550121914369 2016-11-06 20:13:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde They've just turned him loose on a few of those catches....
795357952974716928 2016-11-06 20:11:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @corbydavidson He's apparently been given the nickname 'Narco' by @SheaInIrving....good stuff.

795348505686577154 2016-11-06 19:33:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Right, the lack of pass rush has always been there, but it exacerbates the secondary injury issues.
795347644868677634 2016-11-06 19:30:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Barry Church as well....plus the lack of a pass rush.
795347454560452608 2016-11-06 19:29:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DezBryant @SheaInIrving @jgruen78 They committed PI....and it was obvious. There should have been a flag.
795347079417753600 2016-11-06 19:28:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @toddarcher 2-minute drill is where the lack of pash rush and secondary injuries will really hurt this defense

795334707970011136 2016-11-06 18:39:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr Deserved one.....that was PI.

795328803312640004 2016-11-06 18:15:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Losing your starting center is big for any team
795328380027699200 2016-11-06 18:13:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris It's a hit for both teams, but probably bigger for the Browns.
795328158564225024 2016-11-06 18:13:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Don't know what David Irving did....
795327830326382592 2016-11-06 18:11:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris The only thing we saw was the Browns center rip off Irving's helmet and throw it at him.
795327669126725632 2016-11-06 18:11:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimCowlishaw It's a loss for both teams. David Irving has been playing VERY well....
795320359692210178 2016-11-06 17:42:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HumbleTeej @craigfloyd I'm concerned about it. No Claiborne, no Chruch, CLE get Coleman back....
795315077612244992 2016-11-06 17:21:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> I'm concerned about the CLE game for @dallascowboys. Classic trap game. No Claiborne, no Church, CLE gets Coleman back. I hope I'm wrong.
795311046164619264 2016-11-06 17:05:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kurtbradley I was thinking more about the possible legal ramifications, but ok....good. hehe....

795097267384553474 2016-11-05 02:55:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports @craigfloyd The report was either 11am or 2:30pm

794999063200616448 2016-11-05 20:25:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @RoFlo @texaszach37 The head coach is running the defense. Gilbert runs the offense. That's the way it's been ALL SEASON.
794998307303067648 2016-11-05 20:22:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo @texaszach37 @BarkingCarnival Put the blame where it belongs, please....
794996717271863297 2016-11-05 20:16:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo @BarkingCarnival He also doesn't overrule Gilbert's play calls
794996019381620737 2016-11-05 20:13:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo That's on Gilbert. 100%
794994379211554816 2016-11-05 20:06:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Agreed....
794991700917841920 2016-11-05 19:56:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden 1st down was on Buechele. He made a bad read.
794975600171687936 2016-11-05 18:52:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd He still should have made the tackle. Period.
794969766297567232 2016-11-05 18:28:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> This is both disgusting and sad.... #TruthDontLiehttps://twitter.com/t_adame/status/794955130718351360
794969202222399489 2016-11-05 18:26:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong @clstanley29 That wasn't even the worst ref screw up on that play. #TheBallBrokeThePlane
794965710413983744 2016-11-05 18:12:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean It should be 38-16 right now....smdh.
794963657419554816 2016-11-05 18:04:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Or 38 (Heard)....
794960460546240517 2016-11-05 17:51:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @thatsean If Foreman still had the ball in his hands (he did) when it broke the plane, it's a TD.
794958192618995712 2016-11-05 17:42:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman He had both hands on the ball. His body got stretched out by someone pulling on the ball while someone else had his legs.
794957507982749696 2016-11-05 17:40:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @Bitterwhiteguy @connagroane fumble short of the goal line
794957392337399808 2016-11-05 17:39:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> WOW....#Big12Refs gonna Big 12 ref. Please fire Walt Anderson and hire competent officials @Big12Conference
794956479430279168 2016-11-05 17:36:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott @craigfloyd It broke the plane before that guy got it out of his hands
794956342972846080 2016-11-05 17:35:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott Because Big 12 refs are terrible....
794956083009822720 2016-11-05 17:34:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SBN_Wescott That ball broke the plane....
794953995215400960 2016-11-05 17:26:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger *didn't really
794953962000711680 2016-11-05 17:26:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Yes, Shack did really engage the guy, but there was contact between them because he was trying to shoot a gap.
794946171982778368 2016-11-05 16:55:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @josephcook89 BLATANT holding against Devante Davis prevented him from making the tackle for no gain or for a loss.
794941589554663424 2016-11-05 16:36:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @sherrodharris It is pretty solid. Well, kind of.....
794941388840402944 2016-11-05 16:36:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @espn @BJ_Stew I actually form my own opinions based on information available through a multitude of sources, but thanks.
794940259771498496 2016-11-05 16:31:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BJ_Stew They're not covering their own. They're covering the BU's, because BU players, coaches, and admins put them in that position.
794937098323324931 2016-11-05 16:19:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BJ_Stew It's funny that you seem to think there's no info out there.

794899494139756545 2016-11-05 13:49:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BaylorFansCom @merckywaters @TXJoyce @Kyle_Kaufman There are striking similarities between Briles truthers and Trump supporters.
794898278731157505 2016-11-05 13:44:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BaylorFansCom @merckywaters @TXJoyce @Kyle_Kaufman I could easily compare Briles fanatics to another group but I don't want to be political

794772966819172352 2016-11-04 05:26:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BaylorFansCom @merckywaters @TXJoyce @LindaCarolRN That research included talking to one of the victims
794772685339394049 2016-11-04 05:25:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BaylorFansCom @merckywaters @TXJoyce @LindaCarolRN I'm a sports guy from Austin who actually takes time to read and research.
794766307120082944 2016-11-04 05:00:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ColemanESPN Solid stuff, brother....
794765919444725760 2016-11-04 04:58:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BaylorFansCom @merckywaters @TXJoyce Of course they are, but who put them in that position? Art, his players, coaches, & BU administrators.
794765287702859776 2016-11-04 04:56:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BaylorFansCom @TXJoyce @merckywaters It's a mess alright. One created by Art's players and made worse by Art, his coaches, & administrators
794763952777494528 2016-11-04 04:51:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BaylorFansCom @TXJoyce @merckywaters And that all the victims are lying?
794763512467886080 2016-11-04 04:49:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BaylorFansCom @TXJoyce @merckywaters So you think the Baylor Regents are lying then? And that Pepper Hamilton lied?
794762684034150400 2016-11-04 04:46:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BaylorFansCom @merckywaters @TXJoyce Because they were complicit in it as well...

794760735528198144 2016-11-04 04:38:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN Don't give him that much credit....
794758218983608321 2016-11-04 04:28:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN Not necessarily, but we should at least research the things that challenge our biases/beliefs to see if there's truth there.

794608040825655298 2016-11-04 18:31:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy He needs to go full-on internet. Video and audio podcasting along with his writing.
794606241368576002 2016-11-04 18:24:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy To me Simmons has never translated well to TV. His writing is brilliant, but on TV his sense of humor comes across assholic

794558695875039232 2016-11-04 15:15:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @daxshepard1 @StacyMaybe the problem with that logic is, he's not an unknown. He's very much a known.

794548536943616000 2016-11-04 14:35:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @daxshepard1 @StacyMaybe There is no evidence of criminal activity in any of those things you mentioned.
794546387702554624 2016-11-04 14:26:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @daxshepard1 @StacyMaybe Yes, you would be. That is a criminal act. Feel free to show proof of criminal act committed by HRC.
794544887245012992 2016-11-04 14:20:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StacyMaybe @daxshepard1 Someone cannot be a criminal if they've never even been charged with a crime.

793182660600356864 2016-10-31 20:07:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dallascowboys Hey guys, with Chruch out for a while, @MikeGriff33 is an option worth looking at.
793182068934979584 2016-10-31 20:05:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I wouldn't mind if Dallas gave @MikeGriff33 a call with Church out.
793181771449769985 2016-10-31 20:04:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Like I referenced earlier, I worry about Dallas' def too. They don't have the defense the DEN had last year or NE had in '01
793180627981873152 2016-10-31 19:59:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Mediaite @ChrisMosser 'Asshat' is the perfect word for that guy.
793180160535080961 2016-10-31 19:57:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Maybe, but for Dallas in 2nd half, they're facing better defenses, and in the playoffs, I'd rather have the experience.
793179546782568449 2016-10-31 19:55:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Denver last year?
793178648828219393 2016-10-31 19:51:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Plus, w/ Church & Claiborne out for ext period, they'll need more off production. Romo better suited for that right now than Dak.
793178167250788352 2016-10-31 19:49:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Romo will be needed at some point, most likely. Need to at least find a game to get him some reps in. This week would've been it.
793176812171866112 2016-10-31 19:44:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Other side note: Really disappointed Romo isn't ready yet. CLE would've been perfect team to just let him start and get him reps.
793174769818476544 2016-10-31 19:36:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @espn @chrisgb00 He already apologized for saying it according to @mikefinger. Now he should just do it more publicly.
793174266577465344 2016-10-31 19:34:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Those guys were already doing great work. Collinsworth was so impressed by it, he invested. And yes, he's the only one I know of.
793172754149146624 2016-10-31 19:28:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde When he controls his smugness, yes, because there's no question he knows his stuff.

793168045929668608 2016-10-31 19:09:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports @AnwarRichardson @RifleJohn He needs to apologize publicly (he already did to print guys), but suspending him is ridiculous

793137889844469760 2016-10-31 17:09:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @jrgflowers (2/2) Which QB is better suited to ramp up point production w/ better defenses coming? Romo or Dak? Romo: easy answer
793137294064484352 2016-10-31 17:07:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @jrgflowers Key point: Dallas is going to need their offense to score more points w/ Chruch & Claiborne out for many weeks (1/2)

792961331108335616 2016-10-30 05:28:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I think losing Claiborne and Church on defense may have had something to do with it. He wanted to go for the win right then.

792925456404058112 2016-10-30 03:05:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy How have you not seen that before now?
792925311847403520 2016-10-30 03:05:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde (4) Dak has played like a rookie
792924765530886144 2016-10-30 03:02:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TonyDungy Dallas doesn't have much pass rush, period.
792919921923543040 2016-10-30 02:43:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> Dak is playing like a rookie for the 1st time this season. @dallascowboys
792915254644662272 2016-10-30 02:25:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving You have a bias and it overrides your logic. It's ok....you're not alone, but you can't fix a problem until you recognize it.
792914652074156032 2016-10-30 02:22:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> The bye week has apparently hurt, not helped this team. It broke their momentum. #MentalMistakes @dallascowboys
792914133528092672 2016-10-30 02:20:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Get mad at Basacia and the special teams. They have basically given Philly 10 points tonight.
792913261536522240 2016-10-30 02:17:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @jenordin It was actually about a month ago

792911225008992256 2016-10-30 02:09:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @jenordin And no.....they're not better than they've ever been, especially at calling balls and strikes.
792910450715340800 2016-10-30 02:05:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving 1st half plays for Dallas: 13 pass, 14 run. They made 1 bad call, and Dak made a bad read on it. It happens.
792909339887411200 2016-10-30 02:01:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Yes, I think Linehan has the freedom to call whatever play he sees fit... just like every OC in the NFL.
792909163131056128 2016-10-30 02:00:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Calm down, Shea. Should Dallas have run the ball on 2nd & goal? Yes, but Dallas had 14 runs and 13 passes in the 1st half.
792908569490305024 2016-10-30 01:58:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving I love how you don't blame the OC...the one who calls the plays...at all.

792491152083562496 2016-10-29 22:19:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden And Gilbert out-thought himself....again....by bringing in Swoopes at the wrong time.
792490677082828800 2016-10-29 22:17:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Gilbert completely out-thought himself there by bringing in Swoopes.
792484513297240065 2016-10-29 21:53:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chris_hummer @mikefinger @srr50 If you want to say it was terrible that guys were confused, fine, but because they were the TO was needed
792483779294081026 2016-10-29 21:50:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Garrett_Greene Regardless, the TO was necessary because, before the snap guys were totally confused on that play.
792483443539972097 2016-10-29 21:49:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @McClain_on_NFL @Nick_Mathews I think A LOT of Texas fans don't realize when your whole defense is confused before the snap, a TO is needed.
792482880794468352 2016-10-29 21:46:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Guys were totally confused before that play. The TO was necessary.
792482319051264000 2016-10-29 21:44:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Garrett_Greene And what if they had given up a TD on the free play where guys were obviously confused?
792481960035700736 2016-10-29 21:43:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @druceleroy They had to call that TO....
792478202136449026 2016-10-29 21:28:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattmosley He was 6 yards downfield, though....
792477080495587328 2016-10-29 21:23:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @briangriese @espnSteveLevy IT WAS RULED A FUMBLE!!! Swoopes RECEOVERED IT!!! If you're not going to pay attention, go home!!
792476244017229824 2016-10-29 21:20:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @briangriese @espnSteveLevy Swoopes recovered the "fumble that wasn't" anyway. MOVE ON!!!
792468961749180416 2016-10-29 20:51:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kbohls Domingue doesn't have the 53-yd FG club in his bag
792466712931086336 2016-10-29 20:42:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS You and all the other guys in the pressbox complaining about how long the 1st Q took is a bad look. Just sayin'....
792464701582041089 2016-10-29 20:34:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak I'm not. It was very close....too close to overturn, IMO.
792464552864604160 2016-10-29 20:34:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving It's so close, I don't think they overturn it
792462737565585408 2016-10-29 20:26:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy THere's another one....THROW THE BALL AWAY!!!
792462079701639168 2016-10-29 20:24:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I'll give Buechele shit for taking that sack, but not for 3rd & 18
792460358464053248 2016-10-29 20:17:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @WWMcClyde Why not? It's news....
792457401995669504 2016-10-29 20:05:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckCarltonDMN He was pushed and he tripped over Zamora's foot
792448923755384832 2016-10-29 19:32:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @MattRHinton LOL - Like he was on it to begin with?
792441436624949248 2016-10-29 19:02:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde But it was his friend's boat, yes?
792441197524496384 2016-10-29 19:01:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I don't believe he was driving though, was he?
792384745950765057 2016-10-29 15:16:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SedanoESPN My "kid" moment was meeting Nolan Ryan a few years ago when I was working at The Zone here in Austin.
792383845748191232 2016-10-29 15:13:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LanceZierlein That airport is The Suck....
792364793206235136 2016-10-29 13:57:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @catosterman I'm smiling at the thought of you frustratingly trying to make your hair curl. Has the wand been thrown across the room yet? ;)
792363891753783296 2016-10-29 13:54:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN Disagree...he didn't have to do that PC (unprecedented) and scold Hillary publicly. Was he trying to appease within the FBI?
792363198456352768 2016-10-29 13:51:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy He would be running away with this thing.....
792155090513633280 2016-10-28 00:04:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> It's time for Round Rock @ Hendrickson with @Mike_Odie34, my mustache, and myself on @kmacsports
792102187333619712 2016-10-28 20:34:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon Until James Comey decided he wanted to insert himself into the Presidential election....
792069979545886720 2016-10-28 18:26:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports If Tony is ready to go next week, start him so can get some reps in. After all, it is just the Browns....
791860026390392832 2016-10-27 04:31:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman It's just brutal....
791749435357134849 2016-10-27 21:12:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @miakhalifa Do you keep running over shit and flattening your tires?
791702219317911552 2016-10-27 18:04:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Give her a minute.... I'm sure she'll think of something.... Wait for it, guys.... Hold for an answer....
791690903073148928 2016-10-27 17:19:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TonyReali This is acceptable....
791690591734079489 2016-10-27 17:18:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TonyReali Sooooo disturbing....
791498009942986753 2016-10-26 04:33:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @Every6thDay @King_Yunn He does look very silly. My point was....I don't believe this guy was KNOWINGLY TRYING to be racist.
791497488217759748 2016-10-26 04:31:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @Every6thDay @King_Yunn I don't disagree....
791471861309714432 2016-10-26 02:49:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @darrenrovell THIS....I agree with.
791471619482890240 2016-10-26 02:48:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @russwest44 @ChrisMosser The look on Westbrook's face is my favorite part of this....
791471232906436608 2016-10-26 02:47:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @karlravechespn Not doing so just make him another "baseball is too slow" complainer who happens to be a HOF writer. Suggest a solution.
791470169793015808 2016-10-26 02:42:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @karlravechespn Not if he doesn't give realistic ideas on how to correct the alleged problem.....
791469826199855104 2016-10-26 02:41:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dmn_cowboys He's not wrong.....
791468956796071939 2016-10-26 02:37:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @karlravechespn That doesn't make his opinion a good one....
791468840819404800 2016-10-26 02:37:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @Every6thDay I'm going to disagree that this guy is KNOWINGLY trying to be racist. He's dressed up to support his team.
791468385175375872 2016-10-26 02:35:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Dan_Shaughnessy What would you suggest they do, Dan? Throw BP pitches? NY-BOS do this in regular season match-ups every year.
791466448145178625 2016-10-26 02:28:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> That's what they said in 2012 too.....

791459516529324032 2016-10-26 02:00:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB What position do you expect Ryan Reynolds to play, and how much playing time do you think he'll get?
791457425354137600 2016-10-26 01:52:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse YOU can't have it both ways, you hypocrite. If you VOTE for him, you're ENDORSING him....period.
791457210698051584 2016-10-26 01:51:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy He frustrates me to the point of violence.
791456086549143552 2016-10-26 01:46:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jasoninthehouse YOU are one of the primary reasons Congress does little to nothing to move our country forward.
791455719832756224 2016-10-26 01:45:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jasoninthehouse YOU are that bad. YOU have chosen party over country. YOU continue to choose politics over what's best for the country.
791455037696331776 2016-10-26 01:42:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports Just tuned in....
791454806187487232 2016-10-26 01:41:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports Do you have the NBA package at the station?
791454206402048000 2016-10-26 01:39:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon He is one of the people in Congress that make me want to eschew debate and just bash his head against a wall.
791418943671898112 2016-10-26 23:19:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mrBobbyBones I will simply say....Congrats, brother! All my best, man....
791416903759597568 2016-10-26 23:11:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger No, it interests others of us as well.....and frustrates the hell out of us. #KNEEL
791416043289792512 2016-10-26 23:07:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports By the way, the Rockets shouldn't be blacked out here, either....
791415890315051008 2016-10-26 23:07:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RichEisenShow @clarencehilljr If, for no other reason....because it's Cleveland.
791415717115465728 2016-10-26 23:06:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RichEisenShow @clarencehilljr If Romo is cleared and can fully practice next week, I'm willing to bet he goes against CLE.
791415163270246401 2016-10-26 23:04:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports It really irritates the crap out of me that the Mavs are blacked out in Austin. @dallasmavs
791390153122025472 2016-10-26 21:24:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @texas_baseball @DMcComasOB What position is Ryan Reynolds expected to play, and do you think he'll get significant playing time?

791026428078718977 2016-10-25 21:19:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @FanstandATX Just an idea....you guys should have a "standings" page on your site that has both overall and district standings for each team

790947367142895616 2016-10-25 16:05:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Two words....  Experienced. Defense.
790947249215844356 2016-10-25 16:04:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Catharsis was, and still is, needed. Later this week....MUCH Baylor hate.

790634882342936576 2016-10-24 19:23:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @nypost We didn't miss it....we just dismissed it, because it's a non-story.
790621398658015232 2016-10-24 18:30:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen I laughed pretty hard after the Catanzaro miss, but I was in total hysterics after the Hauschka miss. It was hilarious & surreal.
790603480356368384 2016-10-24 17:18:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS Good....that just means the pain will be over by mid-afternoon.
790592009891291140 2016-10-24 16:33:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr They said last week that he wouldn't play against Philly.
790591360709517312 2016-10-24 16:30:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KeithOlbermann @jaketapper That was my thought. There's really no story here....

790405131409817602 2016-10-23 04:10:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BillSimmons Peak ridiculousness....
790405018230808576 2016-10-23 04:10:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> I'm laughing so hard, I can barely see..... #SNF @NFL
790404857257562112 2016-10-23 04:09:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dennisonfox7 Two easy ways ....  1) Avoid listening to/reading praise from anyone other than family/coaches. 2) Don't participate in hype
790403502086369280 2016-10-23 04:04:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen And should have tried a 3rd time....
790402191886385152 2016-10-23 03:59:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimCowlishaw @mattmosley It's not better, but both are bad football.
790401269546438656 2016-10-23 03:55:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @YahooForde @JeffPassan It would be cool, but there are A LOT of people who deserve that honor more. How about just being an invited guest?
790400817673084929 2016-10-23 03:53:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dennisonfox7 This is true, but let's not act like the A LOT of the kids (and the parents in many cases) don't hype themselves up....
790400210862080000 2016-10-23 03:51:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs As much as I saw it in pre-season, I thought I'd see a lot more than we have....

790395942528692224 2016-10-23 03:34:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TimCowlishaw It can be the same thing in reverse too. Go kick FG, kickoff, stop them on 4th....
790395607491813376 2016-10-23 03:32:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaketapper Jake, this really seems like the @WSJ making much ado about nothing. There's barely an indirect link, much less a direct one.

790361164278476802 2016-10-23 01:16:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JRockCLE @keithlaw @longjohn_devin The logo is a leprechaun, not a human. Also, groups of Irish Americans haven't sued/protested ND over it

790027552068808704 2016-10-22 03:10:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal When the Rangers won the AL for the 1st time in 2010, losing the Series sucked, but it didn't dimish the accomplishment.

787786105294761986 2016-10-16 22:43:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dallascowboys @1053thefan @MrChrisArnold I'm convinced Rod Marinelli is some sort of wizard
787772218478436357 2016-10-16 21:48:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde It's a pretty concrete argument
787771862298140672 2016-10-16 21:47:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr It was a bad throw....plain and simple.
787771381542903808 2016-10-16 21:45:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @1053thefan @MikeBacsik That last play should have been PI
787771016319643648 2016-10-16 21:43:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @toddarcher Two of them have been passes to Elliot, though....
787738797932818432 2016-10-16 19:35:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> Davis used the ball as a prop....that's why he was flagged. It's been a rule for a few years now.
787735934854795264 2016-10-16 19:24:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Just shared that on Facebook....spectacularly done.

787376766880841729 2016-10-15 19:37:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @chrisdopark well, it wouldn't seem reasonable to the schools. I'm trying to think of something that would satisfy everyone
787372873333641216 2016-10-15 19:21:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @chrisdopark If they would just figure out a stipend system (not hard), it would be a compromise that would benefit everyone.

786785360185466881 2016-10-13 04:27:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert I think Kershaw in there in case anyone gets on since Jansen is over 40 pitches.

786766638834077696 2016-10-13 03:12:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @miakhalifa @bomani_jones Texas is the job he wants. That's the biggest factor here.

786761910968430592 2016-10-13 02:53:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasChance @The_Raheel She's almost 70. Would it really surprise you if that were true?
786761040021168128 2016-10-13 02:50:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasChance @The_Raheel Why should she be any different from everyone else who isn't sure how to say it?

786752703003328513 2016-10-13 02:17:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JMV1070 A "good move" by a LHP is always a borderline balk.

786745350157574144 2016-10-13 01:48:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mad4ut Your tweet implied 'currently', so you might want to check your grammar next time. Oh, and again....Bill isn't a candidate.
786743931161735168 2016-10-13 01:42:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chucktodd @WillMcAvoyACN I don't remember which publications he suggested that conservatives read
786742845055066113 2016-10-13 01:38:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN I saw those tweets, and I agreed. I was just seeing if you had information about it's origin.
786742561209589760 2016-10-13 01:36:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @mad4ut What child molester is he currently "jet-setting" with, exactly? Also, as Mike said....Bill isn't a candidate.

786741013863866368 2016-10-13 01:30:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN I heard @chucktodd say recently that progressives should read the @NRO and the @WSJ to learn conservative perspective
786740023974518785 2016-10-13 01:26:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN I think some have tried, but in this case they refuse to listen.
786739824560570368 2016-10-13 01:26:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN Do you know, by chance, where that originated from?

786414564560646145 2016-10-12 03:53:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJDelgado13 You find these allegations "not credible". Shocking, coming from a Trump sycophant......

786403888999960576 2016-10-12 03:11:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris People have known about Trump's lecherous behavior for a LONG time. I don't know why this shocks people.
786402671645171713 2016-10-12 03:06:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GriffinEnna Agreed....it just didn't seem to come across as a suggestion, is all. It came across more like a command. Just sayin'....
786400648455565312 2016-10-12 02:58:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GriffinEnna My guess is you'll rarely, if ever, hear them talk politics on the air. Twitter, though, is a place where other topics come up.
786399224212566016 2016-10-12 02:52:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm @GriffinEnna (Trying to be helpful here) Because I see that sentiment all the time on here, and that's usually the implication
786397856668065792 2016-10-12 02:47:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm @GriffinEnna When you say "stick to sports", you imply that he shouldn't be expressing an opinion on anything other than sports
786396279123259392 2016-10-12 02:40:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm Bob, you did nothing wrong, brother. In fact, you did something right. Keep the faith, my friend.
786395935785967617 2016-10-12 02:39:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GriffinEnna @SportsSturm I love "stick to sports" guy. He makes me laugh....

786087536544387073 2016-10-11 06:14:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisGethard @JuddApatow @agaga No, Judd.....keep doing what you're doing. Vigilance is the only way to make sure Trump is defeated.
786085471520710656 2016-10-11 06:05:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris No worries....not going to happen.
786084820938022912 2016-10-11 06:03:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Nick_Offerman You being in Austin makes me happy. I gladly offer you a glass (or more) of your choice of whiskey, on me, while you're here
786083422225784832 2016-10-11 05:57:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert Women....their ratings are high, because women watch those shows in droves.
786012736308154368 2016-10-11 01:16:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @AnwarRichardson Sure, unless you're a 2nd-day selection with a chance to move up to a 1st-round selection....
786011821610106880 2016-10-11 01:13:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @facebook @thatsean Or, like me, they just have no interest in 'liking' their pages so that their Facebook feeds don't get bombarded.
785938998606737408 2016-10-11 20:23:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BorisEP Are you ready for your short political career to come to an end? It's coming.....very soon.
785921314938757122 2016-10-11 19:13:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant he's afraid if he changes clothes, no one will know who he is

785648196236156928 2016-10-10 01:08:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Ok, just letting you know in case....my sister wants to vote for him, but Indiana is one of the states he didn't get on.
785647784237998080 2016-10-10 01:06:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Not on the ballot in all 50 states....
785647607636905984 2016-10-10 01:06:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde That would be....interesting.
785645196545404928 2016-10-10 00:56:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RandyRRQuaid ....in front of her vagina to keep Donald from grabbing it? Sure, but as far as the debate goes....how do you figure he won?
785593010792730625 2016-10-10 21:29:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ClayTravis @thatsean I'm guessing no....
785583926865637376 2016-10-10 20:52:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> Well done Bill Little! A beautiful tribute to @craigway1 and his wife, Laurie. "A Glory of Angels" http://www.texassports.com/news/2016/10/10/football-a-glory-of-angels.aspx#.V_v_NdGrpPE.twitter
785557253407449088 2016-10-10 19:06:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ajjaffe You can forgive him but not support or vote for him. Forgiveness and support are not joined at the hip.
785556825374461953 2016-10-10 19:05:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @dallasnews @DMNOpinion Actually, we saw that look from a number of people in the audience last night when Trump would talk.
785532142574972928 2016-10-10 17:27:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @WWMcClyde That implies that he has any command to begin with....
785530233315143681 2016-10-10 17:19:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KenTremendous Sad would be one emotion that would come forward.....there might also be a couple of others.
785529470190956544 2016-10-10 17:16:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Yes....yes he did.
785491511886516224 2016-10-10 14:45:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> This guy here.... @kenbone18https://twitter.com/CNN/status/785489769929273344
785486718136758272 2016-10-10 14:26:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Andylanger @eramshaw That level of expectation is one step above "He's going to drop a deuce on stage and light it on fire"
785486467434893312 2016-10-10 14:25:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Andylanger @eramshaw That's because the expectations for Trump were "He's going to completely lose his damn mind"....not exactly a high bar
785478154647252992 2016-10-10 13:52:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OliviaMesser Well, the ratings for this debate were a lot lower than the 1st one. That's something, I guess....
785476556177059840 2016-10-10 13:46:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN @jhrusher No sir....typical for you to make a claim you can't/won't back up when given an opportunity to do so.
785475959814172672 2016-10-10 13:43:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN @jhrusher That's what I thought.....typical.
785474660242599937 2016-10-10 13:38:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mgreenMCFC @WillMcAvoyACN @jhrusher And you're claiming there are tales, so please....share.
785474064152301568 2016-10-10 13:36:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mgreenMCFC @WillMcAvoyACN @jhrusher Please sir, regale us with your tales of locker room discussions about sexual assault.
785472548460830720 2016-10-10 13:30:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jhrusher @mgreenMCFC @WillMcAvoyACN My father was a football coach. I grew up in locker rooms. Never heard anyone talk about sexual assault

785471123802554368 2016-10-10 13:24:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richarddeitsch @Bitterwhiteguy @mulvihill79 I actually find this to be a good sign.....
785333887631101952 2016-10-09 04:19:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ajjaffe A large majority of Trump supporters, the ones that have been w/ him since the primaries, don't care about the awful things he says
785325447273787392 2016-10-09 03:45:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @harvdog13 I love "stick to sports" guy. He makes me laugh....and feel better about myself.
785274339620823040 2016-10-09 00:22:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @theScore Not really.....at least not according to what he's been saying.
785273123968921604 2016-10-09 00:17:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak @Mcadams7Andrew I think we should have. The Rangers SP was garbage the whole month of September.

785272001103441920 2016-10-09 00:13:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StewMyrick @BobBallouSports lol
785271042470129664 2016-10-09 00:09:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StewMyrick @BobBallouSports Jason & Jerry both said it again after the game, without hesitation. When Tony is back, he will be the starter
785270650868903936 2016-10-09 00:08:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KeithOlbermann @chucktodd Last time I checked, Bill Clinton isn't running for President.
785265924945305601 2016-10-09 23:49:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> Did I miss something? Is Bill Clinton running for President? No? Ok....didn't think so. #Deflecting #ChildlikeBehavior
785265139381526528 2016-10-09 23:46:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StewMyrick @BobBallouSports I'm basing my choice on what I know about Jerry, because we know he's the one who will make that call.
785264535728852992 2016-10-09 23:43:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StewMyrick @BobBallouSports Come on, man....we all should know Jerry well enough by now. Tony will start once he's back.
785260542202028033 2016-10-09 23:27:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StewMyrick @BobBallouSports 2/2....is if Garrett wants to ease Tony back in by having him as backup his 1st week back.
785260354230071296 2016-10-09 23:27:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StewMyrick @BobBallouSports I will wager you both every $ I have that Tony will start once he's cleared to play.  The only exception... 1/2
785259103425748993 2016-10-09 23:22:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving At the dominant performance?

785170239407267840 2016-10-09 17:29:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Richard_Schiff You can tell that @jaketapper is at the point, especially with Trump surrogates, where he just won't put up with it anymore
785002537225101314 2016-10-08 06:22:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> #LonghornFans It's time to lift up our brother @craigway1 & his family with your prayers. His wife's battle w/ cancer came to an end tonight

784621441849421824 2016-10-07 05:08:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots He's missing the game tomorrow to be with her. Knowing Craig, him doing this means things are very serious, and I'm very worried
784620857683566592 2016-10-07 05:06:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots She's been battling cancer for about 6-7 years...went into remission, then relapsed earlier this year and has taken a bad turn.
784615247231541249 2016-10-07 04:43:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> Anyone who has bothered to pay attention ALREADY KNOWS that @realDonaldTrump is a crude, repugnant person w/ no respect for women. SMDH....

784606825240985600 2016-10-07 04:10:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> Let me get this straight @GOP....THIS is the proverbial straw? 11-yr-old 'hot mic' comments? The last year and a half wasn't awful enough?

783540643478069248 2016-10-04 05:33:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon A lot of his supporters were leaving him because he caved on the "Religious Freedom" bill.

783518989825761281 2016-10-04 04:07:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gjspittle Because it's completely illogical, idiotic, and indefensible?
783517377120071680 2016-10-04 04:01:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> Buck Showalter has forgotten more baseball than I'll ever know, but not using Britton is indefensible. I'm irate if I'm an @Orioles fan.

783408096513105920 2016-10-04 20:46:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tweetgrubes @DallasStars @injuryexpert You should plan a trip to Dallas where we can include a Stars game.
783407846134206464 2016-10-04 20:46:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dennisdoddcbs 3 conference losses won't win the Big 12, IMO, but your point is the same. 8-4 (with an OU win & improved D) may save his job
783407158553481216 2016-10-04 20:43:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tweetgrubes @DallasStars @injuryexpert Very good, sir....and yes, Grubes is as good of a reason as any.
783405251818758144 2016-10-04 20:35:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ddale8 @ChrisMosser That person, and people who think like he does, not only aren't Christians....they give actual  Christians a bad rep.
783403016196022272 2016-10-04 20:26:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert No no....@DallasStars. Young, talented, legitimate threat to win the cup.
783396059733037058 2016-10-04 19:59:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I reserved 3 tickets. Want to come down from Dallas and go to it?
783395472329146368 2016-10-04 19:56:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots WWWOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
783161094261002240 2016-10-03 04:25:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 They need to hire a permanent AD, ASAP.....
783158936874561536 2016-10-03 04:16:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot I think Charlie is playing his last hand, but if they do that, I'll be happy as hell.

783144998384508928 2016-10-03 03:21:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 @eag21581 Here's the thing though, some of the ones who DO know don't care because they didn't want Charlie hired to begin with
783071328915947520 2016-10-03 22:28:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong @Ahaley Oh, I know....hence my dig at others.
783049074387800064 2016-10-03 21:00:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken Coaching changes (and possible changes) are, and have been public for quite some time. Like it or not, it is what it is
783048367228133376 2016-10-03 20:57:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong @Ahaley Yeah, Charlie's guys actually do go to class. Foreign concept for a lot of programs, I know....
783048213343252480 2016-10-03 20:56:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken Plus, everyone (supporters & detractors) KNEW Charlie was on thin ice coming into this season. Now it's cracking....
783047567726620674 2016-10-03 20:54:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken @EricNahlin Thank you for bringing this back up, EN. More examples of Wolken's flawed logic.....
783047267565449216 2016-10-03 20:53:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken Dan's logic, per usual, is quite flawed.....
783044472716206082 2016-10-03 20:42:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken @Ian_A_Boyd "Or chastise you publicly for not doing things the way we think you should...."
783040421043679232 2016-10-03 20:25:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @kbohls UT Parking & Traffic is like Janice in Accounting.....they don't give a F***!!! You guys should know this by now.
783039946533642240 2016-10-03 20:24:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong @Ahaley Maybe because they're in class?
782935563825389568 2016-10-03 13:29:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser Although, you have to wonder how many votes 'Don't Care' would get, hehe.
782935388620861441 2016-10-03 13:28:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser It's news worthy, I know.....just having a little fun.
782918089780277248 2016-10-03 12:19:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser You forgot to add 'Don't Care' to that poll. ;)
782717902466134016 2016-10-02 23:04:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving DB had his arm in there, Butler couldn't pull it in.
782713195525877760 2016-10-02 22:45:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @lonestarball @NewbergReport I can understand why people are talking about benching Mazara next week. He's STRUH-GUH-LING
782702808826908672 2016-10-02 22:04:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @lonestarball @theoldgreywolf I would also agree with Hoying over Delino. They both have speed, but Hoying gives you defense
782698644491218944 2016-10-02 21:47:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde God forbid @MLBNetwork show it.....
782688315073966080 2016-10-02 21:06:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant He's throwing better than Kela right now, IMO.
782687831831384064 2016-10-02 21:04:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant The way he's throwing, that's an easy choice for me.
782687581741854722 2016-10-02 21:03:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant So, if they only take one of those 3, who's the extra pitcher?
782687316036898816 2016-10-02 21:02:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Will the have Griffin as a possible long man?

782651513902542848 2016-10-02 18:40:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ken_Rosenthal I was with him until he said Vin was the most important person in the history of the Dodgers. Um, Jackie Robinson? Hello?

782624659824971776 2016-10-02 16:53:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikethemiz ....@metalhead684
782624167057174529 2016-10-02 16:51:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikethemiz No. He's going to get some work, but not a full load. This eliminates Spencer Ware as well, probably.
782410857334439936 2016-10-01 02:44:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant What can Rua play besides 1B & LF?
782407929341149184 2016-10-01 02:32:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @BDavisAAS Ya think?
782381144419381249 2016-10-01 00:46:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Does the arm getting hit not matter? I thought it did....
782361479324368896 2016-10-01 23:28:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I was considering a holocaust documentary....
782360716787363840 2016-10-01 23:25:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @franfraschilla @DeezNoze Oh I remember. The day it came in the mail, you would walk into the station with a huge smile on your face, hehehe

782349182333968384 2016-10-01 22:39:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong @Cjblack1983 @tomfnherman Will everyone get cheek kisses or is that reserved for just family and players?
782304919298592768 2016-10-01 19:43:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @miguelevision oh yeah, it probably happens tomorrow.
782303643630383105 2016-10-01 19:38:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> The only things could possibly stave off Charlie losing his job now is a win in Dallas next week, and that would just be a temporary stay.
782303274078658560 2016-10-01 19:36:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> I'm as big a Charlie supporter as has existed, but the ship is sinking. Vance probably gets fired, but that's just rearranging deck chairs.
782302257496793088 2016-10-01 19:32:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @texasdobbs Also, "lose"....

782299502581395456 2016-10-01 19:21:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin Patrick has been as bad at the Texas defense in this game
782298809392967680 2016-10-01 19:19:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny I think he was declared out after warmups
782298303769620480 2016-10-01 19:17:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @aasdanny He's not playing today, is he? (Hamstring)
782296582481862656 2016-10-01 19:10:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots Very little....
782294133050216448 2016-10-01 19:00:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy No way Vance survives this weekend. Tackling isn't on him, but there's still been assignment busts.
782290803221602305 2016-10-01 18:47:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WesKCrochet Sorry, twelve....my bad.
782289825256738816 2016-10-01 18:43:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @WesKCrochet Texas was down 5 at the half and getting the ball to start the 2nd half. Stupid comment....
782288886999359488 2016-10-01 18:39:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy That was a horrible series by Gilbert.

782281724977827840 2016-10-01 18:11:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Nothing wrong with our kicker, it's the fact that OSU is being allowed to commit an uncalled penalty on every kick.
782267729122242560 2016-10-01 17:15:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong Is this true @HaileeStrong1?

782097208367648768 2016-09-30 05:57:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 From a broadcasting perspective, that might be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of/seen.

782035605265850368 2016-09-30 01:53:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets @CHQ_Jordan The reason that makes even less sense is that Garrett played here. He's still the same guy he was as a player.

781572701743788032 2016-09-29 19:13:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot While I agree with you on A&M, I'm pretty sure our AD told them to step off when it came to still playing them after they left.
781569906357612544 2016-09-29 19:02:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GovGaryJohnson I believe the question from @HardballChris was "a world leader you like & respect". Care to try again?

781566207203737601 2016-09-29 18:47:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tccasillas @iamelf @1033fmESPN Workout and try to be ready for next week. Pretty easy....
781565759084298240 2016-09-29 18:46:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OliviaMesser I still remember the sound of shotgun blasts (blanks) on UT campus in the spring, trying to scare them off.

781563966577266688 2016-09-29 18:39:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @csmithSEC @injuryexpert @SECcountry Yeah....no thank you.
781563492897689600 2016-09-29 18:37:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert I believe I read "slight stress fracture to the tibial plateau"
781549987591106561 2016-09-29 17:43:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kbohls Three reasons:   1) ACL Fest 2) A LOT of Longhorn fans traveled to the Cal game. 3) The trip to Dallas is next weekend.
781549427936813056 2016-09-29 17:41:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> This. So much this....https://twitter.com/WWMcClyde/status/781491006613008384
781371084234862592 2016-09-28 05:52:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival Always wondered that myself....
781358665844400129 2016-09-28 05:03:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport @Evan_P_Grant @lonestarball Have you guys written articles yet on the playoff roster? If so, could you link them in a reply?
781349533745721344 2016-09-28 04:27:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd Oh, you didn't pack/dress for it.....gotcha.
781347094711767040 2016-09-28 04:17:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd The hell you aren't....
781340765687455744 2016-09-28 03:52:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @hughhewitt Your argument that you're voting for Trump because of SCOTUS is a joke. What makes you think he would nominate someone you like?
781335518520893440 2016-09-28 03:31:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> Beltran, Lucroy, & Gomez since joining @Rangers - 58 R, 24 HRs, 72 RBI, .280 BA combined. JD is a BOSS!! @NewbergReport @Evan_P_Grant

781330334659055616 2016-09-28 03:10:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BryanDolgin I think Bush gets that chance before Jeffress, if they decide to make change.
781329883729371136 2016-09-28 03:08:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I thought picking him up was a no-lose situation. Anything you got would be a bonus, but holy shit....
781329470632452096 2016-09-28 03:07:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde When they picked him up, I was like "Ok, more upside than Deshields or Stubbs. Maybe he can solidify the 4th OF spot." Now? Damn!
781329046516985857 2016-09-28 03:05:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Again.....
781328840694136833 2016-09-28 03:04:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde .291 Avg, 8 HRs, 24 RBI, 18 Rs, 5 SBs since joining the @Rangers.....unreal.
781320876373540869 2016-09-28 02:33:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball Some definite bad luck tonight and bad defense behind him tonight.....
781295498850213888 2016-09-28 00:52:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @ReedRobertson Yeah, this is just a silly comment.
781294328245211136 2016-09-28 00:47:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Two bloop hits off the fists, an actual error, and a mental error. Bad luck inning for Hollywood....
781286033618903040 2016-09-28 00:14:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> If being POTUS was only about domestic policy @GovGaryJohnson would be a competitive choice, but it isn't. He lacks foreign policy knowledge
781274175080017920 2016-09-28 23:27:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JoyAnnReid He said he didn't think Trump was qualified. He just happens to have big reservations about Hillary as well.
781272489494061056 2016-09-28 23:20:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @David_k_710 Wouldn't you rather have Perez starting at home than on the road? The home/road splits are dramatic.
781185756354129920 2016-09-28 17:36:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger I wasn't claiming to, and you're right about the vaccum. I'm also glad Vance was cool with it.
781184597409173504 2016-09-28 17:31:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @davidubben Ha!! Thanks Hannity....

781181747748745217 2016-09-28 17:20:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Let me clarify. I wasn't saying the subject shouldn't have been broached. I'm saying it could have been asked in a better way.
781181223066492928 2016-09-28 17:18:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Vance is a direct guy. I get that. That still doesn't make it a good question, IMO.
781180583338577920 2016-09-28 17:15:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> While I totally understand the thoughts and emotions behind it, this is setting a dangerous precedent that could come back to bite us.https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/781170258933583872
781178716625915909 2016-09-28 17:08:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger What a shit question. Seriously, that's awful....
781145165880659968 2016-09-28 14:54:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken @thatsean @P_J_Willett Yes.....it's called 'smack talk'.

780824005875859456 2016-09-27 17:38:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @lotterypicker Perhaps you should Google what a lavalier microphone is. They both had one on. Yeesh....
780819702830419969 2016-09-27 17:21:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HelmetBoy_Texas Yes, the guys at @ringer did. It's actually pretty funny.
780617079418335232 2016-09-26 03:56:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @jacobbanfield2 We've found another "stick to sports" guy! I love those guys! They think no one else is allowed an opinion.

780490176283815937 2016-09-26 19:32:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlexDunlapNFL I was speaking generally.
780490108457725952 2016-09-26 19:31:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlexDunlapNFL In your case, watching MNF is part of your job, so you would be excused.
780476301291298817 2016-09-26 18:37:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB @AnwarRichardson Yes he deserves credit, but it sounds like Charlie didn't really give him an option....and I agree with Charlie
780473225817894912 2016-09-26 18:24:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tweetgrubes I see what you did there....
780265506305478656 2016-09-25 04:39:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch lol
780265464773562368 2016-09-25 04:39:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch Not total horseshit, no.....but not very good either.
780264987423944704 2016-09-25 04:37:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch Oh, and Aikman also had a rookie head coach
780264898391449600 2016-09-25 04:37:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch '89 Rafferty's was last year. Newton, Tuinei, & Gogan weren't close to elite OL then. Dak has a noticeably better team around him.
780260417377447938 2016-09-25 04:19:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch *tips cap* ok then....
780260113227448320 2016-09-25 04:18:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde and for a fumble that Hoyer did all on his own.....
780259935741292545 2016-09-25 04:17:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch Not a remotely fair comparison....
780257609114718208 2016-09-25 04:08:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon @WWMcClyde Watching the entire team tip their 'NL West Champs' hats to him during their on-field celebration was tear-jerking.
780254127699791872 2016-09-25 03:54:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> The best part about this game tonight was seeing the @dallascowboys do what you should to do against an inferior opponent....put them down.
780243625351507968 2016-09-25 03:12:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlexDunlapNFL @MarkDice While I don't agree with the "You're not American" hyperbole, I do agree that the debate should rank above MNF.
780241574810652672 2016-09-25 03:04:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast Again, better academics is a non-factor when it comes to the level of the quality of the job.
780241462113947649 2016-09-25 03:03:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast Has LSU had a hard time getting kids they want out of Texas? The answer is no. They don't get every kid, but no one does.
780239116931739648 2016-09-25 02:54:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast I'll give you the administration argument though.....
780239014196412416 2016-09-25 02:54:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast Stadium isn't new, academics have nothing to do w/level of quality of job, being in LA doesn't affect ability to recruit TX
780236508204769280 2016-09-25 02:44:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanTPendergast Based on what?
780235211137163264 2016-09-25 02:39:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> Dallas is doing everything they can to keep Chicago in this game
780234971629821952 2016-09-25 02:38:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Eff-ing Linehan.....2&3 and 3&3 and they throw both plays.
780220618029477888 2016-09-25 01:41:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @nickeatman Art Briles has no business being on the @dallascowboys sideline. And yes, I know the relationship he has w/Jerry

779897412080902144 2016-09-24 04:16:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> Oklahoma State and Arkansas are giving away games tonight.
779896187126034432 2016-09-24 04:11:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival They have blown this game, just like the last few years.
779845480125575169 2016-09-24 00:50:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BilldeBlasio @KeithOlbermann Keith wants you and the rest of the kids to get off his lawn, Mr. Mayor.
779825992734957568 2016-09-24 23:32:59 UTC <KevinDunn01> Not a good start for Baylor. Too bad that didn't happen to Ken Starr.pic.twitter.com/CrWjdO8fl1
779824403802578945 2016-09-24 23:26:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Is there a more Douche-y looking coach in CFB than Van Gorder?
779800439990554624 2016-09-24 21:51:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ajjaffe @LetItBurnUSA His TV work would disagree with you. Sports Night, West Wing, Studio 60, Newsroom....all dialogue-driven.
779799313341833216 2016-09-24 21:46:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ajjaffe @LetItBurnUSA Sorkin does that.
779797717778169856 2016-09-24 21:40:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ajjaffe @LetItBurnUSA I said possibly, hehehe.... ;)
779797524273954816 2016-09-24 21:39:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BryanDolgin And overall, he really wasn't all that effective in those outings....
779795104789782529 2016-09-24 21:30:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @LeoRules1 @Klotz32 Oh, I know....but that's why those people need to be challenged.
779794722306920448 2016-09-24 21:28:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tweetgrubes @dfw_dj If they are thinking about using someone else (they're not), I'd give Bush the first chance.
779792604414083073 2016-09-24 21:20:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ajjaffe He's possibly the best dialogue writer ever.
779791860902481920 2016-09-24 21:17:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @LeoRules1 And then you go and make another claim, that I'm assuming you also dont have to back up...
779791591418519552 2016-09-24 21:16:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @LeoRules1 I asked if you had evidence to back up your claim. If you don't, just say so.....
779789445948067841 2016-09-24 21:07:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @LeoRules1 I'm wide awake, thanks.....and that's not evidence.
779787740468490240 2016-09-24 21:00:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Richard_Schiff I'm so glad you and your #WestWing alums are stepping out to help defeat this abhorrent man.
779786490595250176 2016-09-24 20:56:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon You're right. It does nothing but speak volumes about the depths of the vulgarity of @realDonaldTrump
779784219081846784 2016-09-24 20:47:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BryanDolgin He does, but not in that role. Just saying, AJ should be rewarded for his significant contributions.
779783389305974784 2016-09-24 20:43:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BryanDolgin I actually think AJ Griffin would be better in that kind of role.
779783226172649473 2016-09-24 20:43:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ochocinco WTF is that and where?
779764972020568064 2016-09-24 19:30:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant When you're only 1/2 game in front for home-field, I just don't think I would have given that many guys a day off at once.
779762225095380992 2016-09-24 19:19:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 @anamariecox Um.....what?
779761602048303106 2016-09-24 19:17:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @LeoRules1 Murderous, you say? And I'm sure you have evidence to back up that claim, right? Oh.....wait.....
779552292387168256 2016-09-23 05:25:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong Me too.........with some bourbon added.
779545067463729153 2016-09-23 04:56:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @Rangers player I'm most happy for is @ElvisandrusSS1. He recovered from last postseason's gut-punch to have his best season as a pro.

778802817687355392 2016-09-21 03:47:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KenTremendous The Rangers low RD is partially due to high amount of 1-run games, but also because they've had more blowout losses than wins

777932485443276800 2016-09-19 18:08:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman Correct. It's either a player retention issue on knowing assignments, a teaching issue of said assignments, or a combo of both.
777930116886167552 2016-09-19 17:59:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong I thought this song was fitting coach. It's about your old friend Darkness & it's by Disturbd which I know you are right now.

777920925782061056 2016-09-19 17:22:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival I don't know about every in-game call, but scheme and game-plan? Hell yes he is.
777692499523489792 2016-09-18 02:15:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @kylegriffin1 @athlette Interesting opinion.....care to expand on that?
777676539357908992 2016-09-18 01:11:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @danrafaelespn @3nr7ke It's not legitimate considering what the purse will end up being. Offer the man 40% and get the deal done
777675779450638336 2016-09-18 01:08:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @danrafaelespn @3nr7ke If Golden Boy and Canelo really want this fight, they'll make a legitimate offer.
777675524235591680 2016-09-18 01:07:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @danrafaelespn @3nr7ke Yes he has a big following. Not like Canelo but still big. PPV buys for 1 fight are not an indication of following.
777674076991074304 2016-09-18 01:02:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Official_MalikJ You fellas keep your chins high. Two weeks until revenge for last year. The true fans are behind you. Ignore the outliers.
777668623057821697 2016-09-18 00:40:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @danrafaelespn @3nr7ke Canelo demanding 2/3 (or more from most reports) of the purse is, quite simply, not a serious offer.
777668401065889792 2016-09-18 00:39:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @danrafaelespn @3nr7ke Because this is a business. GGG is a top 5 PFP fighter with a big following. He deserves to be compensated as such.
777599210090696705 2016-09-18 20:04:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> Maybe he'll have a Durant jersey too......Justin Durant. ;)
777586672145801216 2016-09-18 19:14:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @TimCowlishaw If you call a FG a win when they basically started the possession in FG range, then ok.
777586268637044736 2016-09-18 19:13:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @TimCowlishaw With this defense? Are you kidding? It's a very bad idea.
777563337450070016 2016-09-18 17:42:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MeganJoWillis Fantastic series. Aaron Sorkin at his best.
777543206560870401 2016-09-18 16:22:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> The mood that @CoachBedfordUT and @Strong_TexasFB should be in....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BkriZXn4cQ
777409458079096832 2016-09-18 07:30:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> The refs blew that call....period. That isn't why Texas lost.
777406646540578821 2016-09-18 07:19:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps They made some questionable decisions in the 2nd half, but the offense isn't why we lost
777404221729550336 2016-09-18 07:09:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I know we're young in the secondary, but the way they played tonight, against an attack they knew was coming, was ridiculous.
777403537152094208 2016-09-18 07:07:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I really love @CoachBedfordUT, but it's time for a change
777402781992792064 2016-09-18 07:04:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris They did exactly what we thought they would do, but didn't even slow it down. Unacceptable....
777402557165543424 2016-09-18 07:03:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GregSwindell Time for a change at DC
777401433377222656 2016-09-17 06:58:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean He's wrong.....
777401233061523456 2016-09-17 06:57:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> The officials blew the call on that fumble, but that's not why Texas lost. I like @CoachBedfordUT but it's time for a change. #Big12RefsSuck
777391621373464576 2016-09-17 06:19:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @danrafaelespn If Canelo is demanding more than 60% of the purse, GGG would be crazy to accept

777323140841996288 2016-09-17 01:47:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> Felonious Joe's TD was not a TD, but the replay ref missed it.

776655699577155584 2016-09-15 05:35:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong @ChristineHookEm Is the chokeslam usually performed one-handed or do you use a 2nd hand behind slamee's back, for support?
776654666390118400 2016-09-15 05:31:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong @ChristineHookEm Congratulations on the new gig, Christine! What kind of benefits are included?

776069346644807681 2016-09-14 14:45:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dpshow Ask Nathan if he feels OSU should "give back" their win over Texas last year....
775917058689118209 2016-09-13 04:40:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoachSeahorn @Bitterwhiteguy The shirts have apparently been removed. In all fairness, Academy made that same shirt for multiple schools.

775909283900760064 2016-09-13 04:09:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving No doubt. I like him answering the question, but he got a bit out of his depth. You should read this. https://www.facebook.com/thisean/posts/10153987572113391?hc_location=ufi
775907835129376768 2016-09-13 04:03:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Dabo was speaking from a good place for sure, but he was a bit over his skis with the MLK stuff. Heart is in the right place.
775904391383486464 2016-09-13 03:49:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump That is work. Making sure you are soundly defeated is most definitely part of his job now.
775903918144401408 2016-09-13 03:48:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PaulHook_em You're right, it's different. Academy created (or had it created) that same shirt for multiple schools. I saw it earlier.
775902842678759424 2016-09-13 03:43:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots Nah.....
775901632030650368 2016-09-13 03:38:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PaulHook_em Baylor (like a lot of other schools) probably gave them license (paid for) to sell apparel, but didn't create it.
775901125849473024 2016-09-13 03:36:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PaulHook_em No, seriously. If you look at the other stuff on that site (Academy took this one off), it's a part of the college apparel page
775899211246084096 2016-09-13 03:29:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PaulHook_em Whoa whoa whoa. I'm pretty sure Baylor has nothing to do with these. A t-shirt company is selling them through Academy.

775893137201913856 2016-09-13 03:05:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenDuBose No no...using the last two night alone would be silly. Using the Rangers' 28-9 record over the last two seasons? THAT'S evidence!

775890151339806720 2016-09-13 02:53:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball 9-28 vs Texas the last two seasons....because of this, if/when this turns around some, they're going to be insufferable.

775885791947927552 2016-09-13 02:36:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo It Was Francona's 1st year with CLE, when they came out of nowhere to contend, but they went something like 3-16 against DET.
775885312417419264 2016-09-13 02:34:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo Indians had the same issue with the Tigers in 2013 or 2014.
775884941871632384 2016-09-13 02:32:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball I would say Bush or Claudio. What was the result?

775757928384966656 2016-09-13 18:07:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> I like this T-shirt & may buy one, but I hope @breakingtco is saving a cut for @tswoopes18 for after the season. http://breakingt.com/products/18-wheeler

775735425847537669 2016-09-13 16:38:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chucklindell @Bitterwhiteguy Yes, I know that. I should have clarified. I meant in modern history, post-Civil Rights Act.
775734637024776192 2016-09-13 16:35:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @GTOphil Ok, my apologies. I thought that was your inference.
775728862550331392 2016-09-13 16:12:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @GTOphil Ben is not "bought" by Jerry. You're over your skis on that one.
775728590851682304 2016-09-13 16:11:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @chucklindell You say that, but when was the last time a Dem-controlled state leg tried to pass a law to restrict voting?

775571387419201536 2016-09-12 05:46:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rexchapman @marcisenberg Outside of the Baylor comment, that statement is asinine.

775558616875085824 2016-09-12 04:55:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Side note....nice, rarely-seen quality road start from Perez tonight.

775550448447074304 2016-09-12 04:23:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert If you're not sure, then yes....best to use caution and consult trusted people within the profession on the decision.
775544121607925760 2016-09-12 03:58:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball The rare road quality start.....about time.
775543843114536960 2016-09-12 03:57:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ClayTravis Sure, if you support or know nothing about HB2. If you do, then other than the Baylor part, you know that statement is asinine.
775543168129310720 2016-09-12 03:54:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Never mind....didn't know about the injury.

775542988806041600 2016-09-12 03:53:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant I hope it works, but this is a BAD idea, IMO. Barnette would be a better choice here.
775542813068976128 2016-09-12 03:53:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sbass1310 Um....really? Barnette would be a MUCH better choice here.
775542506364690432 2016-09-12 03:51:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports I don't think they had a good angle on replay, but based on height & where it landed there's no way it could have been foul
775541927911362560 2016-09-12 03:49:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant That ball was fair....

775508391288418304 2016-09-12 01:36:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> The part of the statement that is quoted in this tweet is true.....the rest of it is asinine.https://twitter.com/_andrewcarter/status/775506308766236672
775500773606043648 2016-09-12 01:06:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I didn't say we were "Back".....just that it's turned.

775437669044137984 2016-09-12 20:55:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KellyannePolls @mcuban @robbiese7en To which the response should be "If you can't speak for the campaign, then why should we have you on?"
775436510996811776 2016-09-12 20:50:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @cartwrighteous And unfortunately too many show hosts won't cutoff surrogates when they do that and press them to answer.
775435763756392448 2016-09-12 20:47:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @cartwrighteous The chances of that are pretty high, actually....sad but true
775431287259566081 2016-09-12 20:30:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsDayDFW @dmn_cowboys @RickGosselinDMN That game was lost before that play ever happened.

775412782334222336 2016-09-12 19:16:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BDavisAAS It still shouldn't have been a penalty....
775391838639263745 2016-09-12 17:53:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball Outside of a Texas win, of course....  The magic number is at 10, yes?
775390473246474241 2016-09-12 17:47:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch Dak played a pretty much mistake free game, but let's not act like he won't have those moments too.
775382899881226240 2016-09-12 17:17:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaketapper You're correct, Mr. Tapper.   One candidate has provided those records while the other hasn't.
775382460351721472 2016-09-12 17:15:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I know your were. I was simply returning the "smart-ass", hehe....

775320514625626113 2016-09-12 13:09:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers He had to try and get more yards. If he goes out of bounds he gets to the 44-45 yard line? Not close enough for Bailey....
775169493588815872 2016-09-11 03:09:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @WWMcClyde Myself and @KnowTheGame60 are both disappointed that we couldn't swing this trip as well.
775110749530107904 2016-09-11 23:16:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> The "Best offensive line in football" has been out-played, noticeably, by their counterparts on the other side. @dallascowboys

774673760070701056 2016-09-10 18:19:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ananavarro No, Mrs. Navarro....the sad part is that her statement is probably correct.

774109845809078272 2016-09-08 04:59:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @joelklatt @AriyaMassoudi Also today, you also had @MarkEmmertNCAA bitching about the $740k a US swimmer got for winning Olympic gold.
774106651708141569 2016-09-08 04:46:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @randyharvey @McClain_on_NFL @MikePereira You can't....
774081529366523904 2016-09-08 03:06:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BryanDolgin Also, was it me or did Desmond look like he wasn't running full-speed? Maybe thinking a throw wasn't coming?
774080773498429444 2016-09-08 03:03:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BryanDolgin Maybe that's why he has the right to be there in that case?
774080511371153409 2016-09-08 03:02:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Also, did it look like Desmond wasn't running full-speed, maybe thinking a throw wasn't coming?
774080229887225856 2016-09-08 03:01:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Could it be it wasn't overturned because the catcher has the right to go get the throw?
774079139678597120 2016-09-08 02:57:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch I think every @dallascowboys fan was happy as hell for him when Denver won this year....or at least they should have been.
774077759949680640 2016-09-08 02:51:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch Davis is Bertier and Kuechley is Campbell, right? #CrossRacialAthleteComparison
774073230998933509 2016-09-08 02:33:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LonghornNetwork @mikepirtleeng Wow....they are becoming more pointless by the day.
774036189904941056 2016-09-08 00:06:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LonghornNetwork What's going on here, guys? No "Longhorn Weekly with Charlie Strong"?? Why do you even exist if you're not showing this??
773992213462208512 2016-09-08 21:11:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RepChrisCollins You are the one that has no clue, sir....and @realDonaldTrump has CERTAINLY proven that he doesn't have one.

773967246313951232 2016-09-08 19:32:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymohr37 Jay, Skip Bayless is a star-equivalent to Khloe Kardashian. Famous? Yes. Credible to listen to on any topic? No. #JayMohrSports

773563057222012929 2016-09-07 16:46:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @Bradcalhoun Editorial sections are for opinions. This endorsement is their opinion. That's why it's in the Editorial section.
773562636977922048 2016-09-07 16:44:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> For the 1st time since FDR the @dallasnews has endorsed a Democrat for President. Wow... @HillaryClinton @Hillary_HQhttp://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160907-we-recommend-hillary-clinton-for-u.s.-president.ece

770997737835761664 2016-08-31 14:52:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean She did actually say that a few years ago. She was referring to physical strength in a discussion about women in the military

770830629415956480 2016-08-30 03:48:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Odor just had a "Dumb & Dumber" moment by TOTALLY REDEEMING HIMSELF!!!

770826790981873665 2016-08-30 03:33:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde And then he goes and TOTALLY REDEEMS HIMSELF!!!!
770826362890223616 2016-08-30 03:31:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Bottom line, Odor has cost the Rangers 2 runs tonight on the bases.
770825656091357184 2016-08-30 03:28:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Right, it was still right there in front of him to see, but Banny needs to have a chat with his 1B coach about that.
770825102086643716 2016-08-30 03:26:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Replay looks like 1B coach sent him

770422038926270464 2016-08-29 00:45:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Maybe, but I say force their hand.
770421580585312256 2016-08-29 00:43:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde and open up the right side more
770421484674162688 2016-08-29 00:42:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde It will stop the overshift
770421178800365568 2016-08-29 00:41:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde That's the other reason to do it. You show you're willing to drop a few bunts against that shift and it'll stop.
770420776990220288 2016-08-29 00:40:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Agreed, but while he's learning that, take the gift single.
770420411003645952 2016-08-29 00:38:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde If Odor is up with no one on, less than two outs, and they do this shift on him, he should punch a bunt to 3rd base every time.
770419468707123200 2016-08-29 00:34:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I love how Lucroy has gotten Yu to stop messing around and just give guys the gas face.

770413990597894144 2016-08-29 00:13:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BobBallouSports @Caseyatthebat1 @Evan_P_Grant But the point about the age difference is a good one.

770391261735821313 2016-08-29 22:42:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @SonOfPicard AJ is right. Kaep is 100% free to protest that way. In turn, people are 100% free to criticize if they disagree.

769576506460778496 2016-08-27 16:45:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith *High Five*
769411283430977536 2016-08-26 05:48:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris You are totally right
769410557959024640 2016-08-26 05:45:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Adam Silver is a forward thinker. Roger Goodell is not. In baseball? There whole sport isn't forward-thinking....
769409989479899136 2016-08-26 05:43:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris it's outdated thinking...  The NBA is going to be the first one to come around on it, you watch...
769409165248913409 2016-08-26 05:40:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I still can't believe professional sports leagues in general won't take it off their banned substance lists.
769404928527740929 2016-08-26 05:23:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris It can be done, but it would take MAJOR $$ & they would have to acquire top-level talent like USFL did before Trump killed it
769402823259856896 2016-08-26 05:15:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris It would be hard though. The spring is NBA playoffs and NFL Draft. Hard to get people to care about CFL-level talent.
769402413518233600 2016-08-26 05:13:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I just don't someone dying of heatstroke, lol
769401442067107840 2016-08-26 05:09:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris The spring, sure....not the summer, though.

768629207807123457 2016-08-24 02:00:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal No, they would probably stay home, just like a lot of GOP voters are planning on doing now.

768256792354619392 2016-08-23 01:21:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport It's unreal how the Rangers, since the break, seemingly get killed by almost every walk.

767114802124591104 2016-08-20 21:43:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamelf @mattmosley @JonHeyman He has better off. potential than Stubbs or Deshields. He's better defensively than Deshields. That = upgrade
767114175554334720 2016-08-20 21:40:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 @WWMcClyde Only sadness as a Longhorn. It's a good baseball move for the Rangers, I think. No risk....

767113270817804288 2016-08-20 21:37:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamelf @mattmosley @JonHeyman I suspect they see him as a potential upgrade at the 4th OF spot for the playoffs.
767110638728392704 2016-08-20 21:26:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @justinwells2424 As much as it saddens me, I think this signing means Drew Stubbs may be gone.
767109526910701568 2016-08-20 21:22:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Doing this now makes him eligible for the post-season roster
767106792232919040 2016-08-20 21:11:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Not sure who is available, but my guess is they want an upgrade at the 4th OF for the playoffs.

766729768171556864 2016-08-19 20:13:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheRoot @clarencehilljr Bad moment for Bob. They happen....   Everyone knows he's better than that.
766727886115962880 2016-08-19 20:05:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @NBCNightlyNews I think he has waited. He was initially going to go down there this week, and postponed it for this reason.
766722725050060800 2016-08-19 19:45:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymohr37 The transgender bathroom law in North Carolina was never put to the voters for passage. #JayMohrSports
766721568521138177 2016-08-19 19:40:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymohr37 Actually Jay, North Carolina voters didn't vote on that law. It was a NC House Bill that the GOP forced through with no debate.

766699209839943680 2016-08-19 18:11:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CFBPlayoff @McMurphyESPN It's ridiculous that he can't be replaced. The season doesn't even start for another two weeks.

766680033028997121 2016-08-19 16:55:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BabeLaufenberg @1053thefan I think there was definitely a doubt due to tenure rules and such.

766110544906465280 2016-08-17 03:12:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser The sense I get is they don't care. They're going to vote 3rd-party or not vote.

765764406647160832 2016-08-16 04:17:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MrBrianKenny @lonestarball @ReedRobertson I definitely agree it should be used to make umps better. Watch tape after every game they call.
765763587403026432 2016-08-16 04:14:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @timvc9 @Evan_P_Grant @aandro I have more concerns about Papelbon than I do about the guys they already have. Now, if someone goes down? Ok.
765763264726896640 2016-08-16 04:12:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MrBrianKenny @lonestarball @ReedRobertson Show me the accuracy numbers and show me if the K-Zone adjust batter to batter.
765763051836547072 2016-08-16 04:11:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @timvc9 @Evan_P_Grant @aandro And I'm saying I don't think he should be.

765761134720851968 2016-08-16 04:04:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @ReedRobertson Someone will need to show me how accurate K-Zone really is & if it adjusts batter to batter before I'll be down
765760715835707394 2016-08-16 04:02:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @timvc9 @Evan_P_Grant @aandro I'm sure he is, but this is also about his attitude. The Rangers don't need his me-first, red-ass persona.
765759616730955776 2016-08-16 03:58:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iracane @injuryexpert Will, that was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a baseball game.

765757808583151616 2016-08-16 03:51:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @ReedRobertson I do think MLB needs to incorporate it more somehow, but carefully....

765756478791659521 2016-08-16 03:45:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak @JimmiemacTCU Joe West is, and has been for some time, a horribly inconsistent strike-caller. He needs to be retired by MLB.
765756121428537344 2016-08-16 03:44:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak That's why I laughed. He's been awful this whole inning.
765755927261700100 2016-08-16 03:43:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sbass1310 He is horrible. This inning, he's been putrid for both teams.
765755702082088960 2016-08-16 03:42:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball Joe West has had an AWFUL inning....for both teams.
765755468581003264 2016-08-16 03:41:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak Joe Wes taketh away....Joe West giveth back, lol.
765755253237035008 2016-08-16 03:40:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @timvc9 @Evan_P_Grant @aandro I know what I've seen from both guys. He's not better.
765754805583097857 2016-08-16 03:39:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets last two times....
765753312058548224 2016-08-16 03:33:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @timvc9 @Evan_P_Grant @aandro Also, make the defensive plays behind your pitchers, and don't get shut down at the plate by JAG pitchers.
765753062510071808 2016-08-16 03:32:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @timvc9 @Evan_P_Grant @aandro Pitch better. There isn't anyone on the market that's going to magically fix anything.
765752843865174016 2016-08-16 03:31:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak Dyson had bad luck in the 9th, but yes....make the defensive play, and maybe score some runs off a JAG pitcher.
765752474837798912 2016-08-16 03:29:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @timvc9 @aandro Papelbon is not a solution
765751092596531200 2016-08-16 03:24:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak I rely on Joe West to call strikes, strikes....and he sucks at it in a major way.
765750453137137664 2016-08-16 03:21:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak And tonight, Joe West and his terrible strike zone assisted....
765750220118339584 2016-08-16 03:20:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant They can thank Joe West and his thigh-high bottom of the zone for that lead.
765748782017359872 2016-08-16 03:15:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway How about you lay some blame on a non-existent offense over the last 4 games? Tonight was not anbout fatigue.
765747215188930560 2016-08-16 03:08:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway You're putting the blame in the wrong place.
765746840591437828 2016-08-16 03:07:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway You think every pitch he threw in tha inning was a fastball?
765746501553262592 2016-08-16 03:06:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Sure...because he was throwing off-speed stuff too. Jesus, dude....
765745995682426880 2016-08-16 03:04:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Excuse me? He was throwing 94-96 tonight.
765745528600616960 2016-08-16 03:02:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway He didn't even pitch the last two games of the Detroit series.
765745427991760896 2016-08-16 03:01:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Clearly? Hardly....
765745316851089408 2016-08-16 03:01:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway This is about the offese sputtering lately, not Dyson being "tired".
765745156062535681 2016-08-16 03:00:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Last night he had a 7-pitch save. Tonight, the runner getting on was just bad luck, then Valencia hits one against the shift.
765744352089952256 2016-08-16 02:57:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Give it a rest...

765729040099520512 2016-08-16 01:56:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant He smoked that pitch and got nothing for it.

765372025288306688 2016-08-15 02:18:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @ShutdownInning why would it be foolish to expect good things from coal Colby when he comes back?
765371508155781120 2016-08-15 02:16:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ShutdownInning @WWMcClyde I would say that still qualifies as a luxury....
765370899180564482 2016-08-15 02:13:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @ShutdownInning Colbra is the key. Holland would be a luxury.
765369493723811840 2016-08-15 02:08:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy actually, check that... I would have taken Fury Road off that list before Rounders
765369322386489344 2016-08-15 02:07:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy yeah, my immediate thought was I would have left off Dune and Rounders, and added Shawshank and Silverado
765369022627979264 2016-08-15 02:06:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @NewbergReport @Evan_P_Grant so, do they recall Rua?
765368307444617216 2016-08-15 02:03:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy that's a good list....
765368106109677568 2016-08-15 02:02:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde these are the ones that just piss you off too...  Not at Choo himself, but still...

765254538706112513 2016-08-15 18:31:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @maggieNYT I love the last part of his statement. He's lying just like Trump is now. He states a "fact" that has no evidence to back it up.

763906499827474435 2016-08-11 01:14:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chastings1049 @KevinDunn01 Oh, no question. It's an eyebrow-raising statement about where ESPN is, currently.
763904327240986624 2016-08-11 01:05:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chastings1049 @KevinDunn01 I'm ok with them going to Wrestlemania, just because of the size of the spectacle, but that's it.
763904080209072128 2016-08-11 01:05:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chastings1049 @KevinDunn01 I completely agree.

763853118958297089 2016-08-11 21:42:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway They chose to go after the rookie instead of the guy with 90+ RBI. It's hard to say that was a bad decision.
763852024412643328 2016-08-11 21:38:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Ok, so Arenado (probably) gets a hit instead of walking....
763850644138577920 2016-08-11 21:32:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Neither Diekman nor Bush were able to locate for shit in this inning.

763847043978670080 2016-08-11 21:18:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @firemanrhea And again, I agree it was the wrong choice there....
763846867310354432 2016-08-11 21:17:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @firemanrhea Your math doesn't always add up

763842860563111936 2016-08-11 21:01:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball In thhat particular scenario, yes....it was a poor choice.

763818122998538244 2016-08-11 19:23:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Buster_ESPN @RocRoxPop @ChiTownSports just don't act like Girardi is somehow being noble and professional here....
763818019541831680 2016-08-11 19:23:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RocRoxPop @ChiTownSports if you want to say Alex is getting what he deserves? Fine...I have no love for the guy.
763815203242774528 2016-08-11 19:11:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Buster_ESPN @ChiTownSports Yeah....sure they are. That's why they trade all those guys away, right?
763815030919835649 2016-08-11 19:11:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Buster_ESPN @ChiTownSports Right....that's why he batted Jeter #2 every game during 2014 during a playoff chase, right?
763814612059860993 2016-08-11 19:09:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Buster_ESPN @ChiTownSports The least he could do is play him during his last week. It's not like the Yankees are making the playoffs (2/2)
763814200376332288 2016-08-11 19:07:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Buster_ESPN @ChiTownSports Alex, regardless of how you feel about him, accepted this obviously forced retirement deal from the Yanks (1/2)
763813838449881088 2016-08-11 19:06:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Buster_ESPN @ChiTownSports That doesn't excuse his behavior.
763813473989959680 2016-08-11 19:04:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Buster_ESPN @ChiTownSports And Girardi is an a-hole....so you have to jerks being jerks to each other.
763811492047179776 2016-08-11 18:57:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Buster_ESPN Girardi has been a grade-A dick all week about this.

763194133817151488 2016-08-09 02:03:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 My point is, Art is Jerry's friend. Jerry is very loyal to his friends. Knowing all that, this statement shouldn't be a surprise.

763083878722437120 2016-08-09 18:45:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JeffPassan They'll get about half back in relief if what I heard was correct, yes
763082673283739648 2016-08-09 18:41:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> I feel awful for you @RealPFielder28. From all reports, you seem like a genuinely great guy & dad, & you're beloved in @Rangers clubhouse.
763081853804752896 2016-08-09 18:37:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jtimberlake Fam will always be fam....
763081452758061056 2016-08-09 18:36:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Guess we'll find out, but it's round 2 of herniated discs in his neck. He could just be calling it....
763081050863996928 2016-08-09 18:34:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Around $36M if true. He was owed $72M by Rangers.
763080772550926336 2016-08-09 18:33:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway The Rangers may get half his remaining contract back as insurance relief according to @BenRogers
762865294427561984 2016-08-08 04:17:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NoahShachtman I've surmised that @seanhannity is like an aging silverback w/o dominance. He creates confrontation to try & gain it.

762815939628765184 2016-08-08 01:01:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @The_Raheel Longhorn on the junk, Texas flag on the ass....I like it.
762815443190976512 2016-08-08 00:59:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @The_Raheel Longhorn on the front, Texas flag on the back? Or 1 set of each?
762814854289698816 2016-08-08 00:56:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon @Ben_Landy I hope they nail his wrinkled ass to the wall.

762810027916742656 2016-08-08 00:37:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @foxnewsalert Yeah....good luck with that one.
762751492579217408 2016-08-08 20:45:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 I would feel that way too if I had your plans this Friday....

762706276488925184 2016-08-08 17:45:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong Coach, ask @KnowTheGame60, @EricNahlin, and @Strong_TexasFB. They were keeping tabs until you got back today.
762705105518891009 2016-08-08 17:40:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sirrod3 The problem is, that isn't an effective strategy against him. All it does is further entrench his supporters.
762679825630830592 2016-08-08 16:00:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport @lonestarball @Evan_P_Grant pesky thing....
762679600061100033 2016-08-08 15:59:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport @lonestarball @Evan_P_Grant Ok, the 40-man....that's probably why they are leaving him in RR
762678128443428865 2016-08-08 15:53:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport @lonestarball @Evan_P_Grant Question: If Stubbs is eligible to come off the DL, wouldn't he be better option than Deshields?
762504371741470720 2016-08-07 04:23:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @USAGym It really is a rulenthat makes no sense
762503795150430208 2016-08-07 04:20:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @mcuban @realDonaldTrump He's been pimp-slapping Trump on Twitter.
762499743507292161 2016-08-07 04:04:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MFollowill You and @tedemrich calling Olympic events....it's awesome and mind-blowing all at once.
762496068869173248 2016-08-07 03:50:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MFollowill You had a great call though, brother....
762479151123050496 2016-08-07 02:42:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RRExpress @drewstubbs13 @catosterman Hopefully he'll be back on the big club Sept 1st
762421579678560258 2016-08-07 22:54:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy ?
762419316226527232 2016-08-07 22:45:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MattPomPom @JasonLaCanfora And this would be a bad thing?

762410832114229248 2016-08-07 22:11:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Took 2 out of freaking 3....
762409017620570112 2016-08-07 22:04:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy But it eliminates future ones which is why it won't happen
762407959359950848 2016-08-07 21:59:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @theoldgreywolf I'd give someone a shot who has shown he can do it before someone who hasn't.
762405052833144832 2016-08-07 21:48:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball He still had 27 saves in MIL with pretty miniscule numbers....
762404599995076608 2016-08-07 21:46:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @theoldgreywolf Dyson thrived in the 8th inning role....
762404476770586625 2016-08-07 21:46:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @theoldgreywolf I know he crapped the bed in the 8th today, but I'd give Jeffress the shot. 27 saves in MIL this year....
762400046008578048 2016-08-07 21:28:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @cary021 @onestrikeaway Well, Jeffress did even worse today, so....
762399558617870336 2016-08-07 21:26:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @cary021 I can be mad at Dyson for walking a guy hitting under .150, but still....you're right.
762398711448080384 2016-08-07 21:23:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde The ABs today with runners on 3rd and less then 2 out have been inexcusable

762371074432524288 2016-08-07 19:33:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Push bunt towards 2B on 0-1 then, after the backed up to DP depth.
762370420045586433 2016-08-07 19:30:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Even with the infield in, I would have tried a safety squeeze on the 1st pitch.
762370165702926336 2016-08-07 19:29:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport @RNLesl A decent throw nails him. It was a good hold at 3B.
762364896184905728 2016-08-07 19:08:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RGBearTerritory Hey, @EricNahlin & @justinwells2424....should Texas give this guy a call?
762361867176058880 2016-08-07 18:56:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @notthefakeSVP I don't know the rules, but it does look fun.
762354608115027970 2016-08-07 18:27:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant Australia
762354086477828096 2016-08-07 18:25:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert Jackie Robinson. The intelligence level of the conversation would be high and could cover a large range of topics.
762338159791185924 2016-08-07 17:22:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 @ahmadsangle @chrisgb00 I approve this message. I loved working with AB. Miss ya fam!
762141699279691777 2016-08-06 04:21:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USCocksman @Bitterwhiteguy @Rangers Texas is 10-2 against them this year.

762110778593857536 2016-08-06 02:19:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Now if they can just score some damn runs for Yu tomorrow....
762109669238112256 2016-08-06 02:14:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Meh....
762107463940190208 2016-08-06 02:05:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway I'm so glad someone else noticed!! It was driving me NUTS!!
762106942600810496 2016-08-06 02:03:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sbass1310 I think Jeffress eventually moves to 8th inning. He gives you a legit closer option if Dyson falters at all.
762106650538803200 2016-08-06 02:02:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon Just saw Stanton's shot. It was 504-ft line drive. An absolute laser beam....
762104990097747968 2016-08-06 01:56:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ErinHogan E, did you get my text about Thinking Texas Football?
762103651405922304 2016-08-06 01:50:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @onestrikeaway With them going to Denver Mon & Tue, I could see them sitting him until they get back home.
762103068305481729 2016-08-06 01:48:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @onestrikeaway They're saying it doesn't appear to be right now, but we'll see....
762102684555943940 2016-08-06 01:46:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @onestrikeaway Let's hope it's not serious.
762102429789716480 2016-08-06 01:45:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant ....@onestrikeaway
762102302379356161 2016-08-06 01:45:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway That really doesn't matter for the purpose of this discussion, though.
762101879358631936 2016-08-06 01:43:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway I don't know if he did, but yeah, unless he did something trying to score, they should have just PR Delino
762101214435606528 2016-08-06 01:41:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Oh shit my bad. I assumed lol. I didn't turn it on until the 6th when I got home. No, you're correct, unless Beltran got hurt
762100550229827585 2016-08-06 01:38:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway because if you bring him in for Beltran, them put him in the field, you lose your DH
762100153465516033 2016-08-06 01:36:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway because it's the 7th inning
762099954529685505 2016-08-06 01:36:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball It was borderline, but this guy has been calling those strikes all night
762099522545655808 2016-08-06 01:34:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway I don't mind being aggressive with two outs
762099379066986497 2016-08-06 01:33:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway On Beltran....yeah, he's slow, but the Astros made two perfect throws.
762099159096631296 2016-08-06 01:32:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway ok, so we'll blame that one on Mazara
762099080965165057 2016-08-06 01:32:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlleyCatFox @WWMcClydepic.twitter.com/ZVhuD2J911
762098739007803392 2016-08-06 01:31:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Am I wrong for thinking Mazara should have been able to avoid that tag earlier?
762098129508282368 2016-08-06 01:28:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlexandraInTX @lonestarball ....@AlleyCatFox
762096306311557120 2016-08-06 01:21:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Oh Jesus....I just saw a vine video of what you're referring to. Holy crap....
762095889984819200 2016-08-06 01:19:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde What did I miss? Lol
761991396878196736 2016-08-06 18:24:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris So much to put on a 18-19 year old....
761985359815127040 2016-08-06 18:00:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Longhorn_fb If you cover or follow @Longhorn_FB, read the TL of @sherrodharris. He is giving GREAT perspective on what it's like to be in that QB room.
761980578698633216 2016-08-06 17:41:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris From what I know, your two situations are different.
761980478811361280 2016-08-06 17:41:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I don't think reporting that accomplishes anything or helps anyone.
761979902778146816 2016-08-06 17:39:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris You had reasons that had nothing to do with football itself, though....
761778434498441216 2016-08-05 04:18:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @Bitterwhiteguy Can't argue with that....
761778031341875200 2016-08-05 04:16:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @Bitterwhiteguy @drafthouse I would go see those two tomorrow if they were showing at The Alamo Ritz
761777386853588992 2016-08-05 04:14:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Kelsey Grammar as beast was so awesome
761777136164179968 2016-08-05 04:13:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris See, I loved those casting choices. Partially because they were allowed to grow into the roles.
761776853560418304 2016-08-05 04:12:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @Bitterwhiteguy Two movies that can't be topped, being seen at the original @drafthouse...Director's cuts of Dune & The Abyss
761775849188188160 2016-08-05 04:08:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris They nailed everything except Sabertooth.
761775724864745472 2016-08-05 04:07:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris The original X-Men, remember, was before Marvel formed their own studio. Plus, it was their 1st real foray into this.
761775239034310656 2016-08-05 04:05:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sirrod3 @QCosby17 Shit, they could use only college players and it would still be total domination
761774658441981952 2016-08-05 04:03:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris It was perfection
761774568767823873 2016-08-05 04:03:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Hot women might be their biggest export
761774375196426240 2016-08-05 04:02:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sirrod3 @QCosby17 The dominantion would be worse than basketball, lol....
761774122078605312 2016-08-05 04:01:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Without question....their biggest win there, in my mind, was Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler in X2
761769377746214913 2016-08-05 03:42:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Marvel has gotten it right far more than wrong.
761767825732009984 2016-08-05 03:36:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @sirrod3 To a megalomaniac, admitting fault or apologizing goes completely against their nature. They'd rather be shot.
761766718150578176 2016-08-05 03:31:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @sirrod3 Of course he didn't....
761746497964650496 2016-08-05 02:11:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Bannister helped him out with his lineup choices tonight.
761745035649884160 2016-08-05 02:05:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattmosley He wasn't going to get to it anyway, so Springer would have scored regardless.
761744641599221760 2016-08-05 02:04:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @uttailgaters Just leave it up to the teams to do it or not.
761744562670874624 2016-08-05 02:03:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @uttailgaters I'm guessing they wouldn't, but even if some did, it would be short-lived.
761744203852357632 2016-08-05 02:02:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @lonestarball Either way, he wasn't getting to it....
761743002150711296 2016-08-05 01:57:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters @WWMcClyde But everone knows 9/11 was why MLB started doing that. Enough already....
761742825578823680 2016-08-05 01:56:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters @WWMcClyde Precisely
761742550046650368 2016-08-05 01:55:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters @WWMcClyde I don't need a reminder of 9/11 every time I watch, or go to, a freaking baseball game.

761717436940898304 2016-08-05 00:16:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @politico He acts like an aging silverback trying to maintain lost dominance.

761631553189318656 2016-08-05 18:34:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kevinkugler @tedemrich Just be safe, fellas....
761631073193242624 2016-08-05 18:32:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo They should have left it rated R instead of re-shooting things for PG-13
761595376621150208 2016-08-05 16:11:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KnowTheGame60 @AlexDunlapNFL The Texas SID office (or someone else) is being silly when it comes to credentials for Texas-ND
761595111566299136 2016-08-05 16:09:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MFollowill @SkinWade We've known this. The rest of the world is now finding out.
761370158782746624 2016-08-04 01:16:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Should have gotten another one there.... Lucroy HAS TO move the runner to 3rd.
761368829830193156 2016-08-04 01:10:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @firemanrhea Yes....in THAT situation it wouldn't have been a good play.
761368487629512705 2016-08-04 01:09:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @firemanrhea When the No.9 hits >.230, is a good bunter w/ speed, & it's the 5th inning trying to pad lead, it's a good play.
761359501903605760 2016-08-04 00:33:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @Buster_ESPN Plus the HBP happened after he got an out. No retaliation should occur....

761357274535251968 2016-08-04 00:24:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @firemanrhea This is not about "old way", "new way", or the math. This is about knowing when a SB is a good idea versus not.

761355519269347328 2016-08-04 00:17:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde So, the Astros will see Perez, Harrell, and Yu....correct?
761353844219449344 2016-08-04 00:11:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Nothing wrong with the decision....just need better execution.
761353721166954496 2016-08-04 00:10:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball They got the run anyway. Nothing wrong with the decision to bunt there (especially with Delino)....just need to execute.

760920470765973504 2016-08-03 19:29:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @KnowTheGame60 @Ian_A_Boyd Citizens United removed limits & transparency which has exponentially worsened the problem
760919723206844416 2016-08-03 19:26:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @KnowTheGame60 @Ian_A_Boyd That may or may not be true, but you sure as hell can put limits on it and add transparency to it
760917984458047488 2016-08-03 19:19:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @KnowTheGame60 @Ian_A_Boyd So you think the Citizens United decision is fine and isn't  a part of the problem?

760614654842245120 2016-08-02 23:13:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Am I wrong for thinking this is one of the worst years in a long time for umpires calling balls and strikes?
760613325587656704 2016-08-02 23:08:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @nadeler @Bannyrooster28 @NewbergReport Who got optioned besides Gallo to make room on the roster?

760523534900744192 2016-08-02 17:11:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Yeah....Maz actually takes pitches. What a concept....
760523154410254336 2016-08-02 17:10:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde That's good too....having Mitch's hot stick behind Odor.
760522747617259520 2016-08-02 17:08:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMN_George This has been the only Cowboys news of interest to me this week.
760516717999038464 2016-08-02 16:44:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Odor is hitting better than Maz since the break
760514483529789440 2016-08-02 16:35:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde sorry, Odor not Profar
760514414734749696 2016-08-02 16:35:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I'd go Profar, Lucroy, Mazara as my 5-6-7, but yeah....
760474488676855808 2016-08-02 13:57:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 AMC does "TV editing" though....
760340221590241280 2016-08-01 05:03:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Alex_10Smith10 I was just stating my thoughts. I didn't mean to imply that you had any issues with the moves.
760339391004876800 2016-08-01 05:00:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @Alex_10Smith10 Getting Jeffress is a hugely underrated part of this deal, IMO.
760339190307393536 2016-08-01 04:59:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @Alex_10Smith10 I have no issues with the moves. Texas is trying to win now and next year. These moves increase those odds.
760338618267291648 2016-08-01 04:57:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @Alex_10Smith10 Just reiterating what I've heard/read....
760338394417278976 2016-08-01 04:56:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @Alex_10Smith10 This is baseball, not football. Guys can play at a high level well into their 30s.
760338135188287488 2016-08-01 04:55:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @Alex_10Smith10 But he's not a pitcher. Ortiz was also the Rangers' most advanced pitching prospect.
760336862569299970 2016-08-01 04:50:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @Alex_10Smith10 I think it partially because he's a pitcher, but also, trading Brinson could open the door to keeping Desmond.
760336578770186240 2016-08-01 04:49:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @Alex_10Smith10 Among people I would consider "in the know", the inclusion of Ortiz drew more wary reaction than did Brinson.
760335779147034624 2016-08-01 04:45:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @Alex_10Smith10 which one?
760335045814915072 2016-08-01 04:42:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert Ortiz is the one giving the most folks some pause....
760304291793948672 2016-08-01 02:40:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN I would prefer to live to see Wednesday.

760248920140242944 2016-08-01 23:00:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving @slumpbuster2001 The price for SP was unacceptably high. Notice how none of the big names were dealt.

760208532750729216 2016-08-01 20:20:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamelf I'm also betting JD is confident the Colby, for sure, will be back on time from his injury. Don't forget about Holland either.

760206533359575040 2016-08-01 20:12:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamelf They got a really good RP in Jeffress. My guess is the asking price for SPs was simply too high.
760206191989403648 2016-08-01 20:10:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Most advanced SP in the system. Projected as No. 2 or 3 starter.
760205866796580865 2016-08-01 20:09:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Luis Ortiz is the one everyone is wary about losing.
760204363214102529 2016-08-01 20:03:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tweetgrubes @NotBumpWills The correct nomenclature is #Errbody. @ChuckFnStrong will confirm this.

760199848003981312 2016-08-01 19:45:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers @Evan_P_Grant Or the Yankees simpltly wanted more prospects, and the Rangers said "Ok...if you pick up Beltran's salary"

759971500686319617 2016-07-31 04:38:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @captainken91 It's untrue that he had done nothing. Regardless, voting for someone simply because they are black is not an act of racism.

759593688997572608 2016-07-30 03:37:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkHalperin Or how they feel about Trump backing out on those donations he promised to vet groups

759591161526792192 2016-07-30 03:27:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> RELEASE THE FURY!!!!
759587639670386688 2016-07-30 03:13:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Been thinking that for a little while myself....
759564206815322112 2016-07-30 01:39:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd So, you want the "leader of the free world" to withdraw from it? (I did appreciate the simplicity of your response, hehehe)
759562344867303425 2016-07-30 01:32:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd How do you think someone, who seems to know very little about foreign policy, can fix it?
759561580480598016 2016-07-30 01:29:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @Ian_A_Boyd I'm also curious....what do you think he's a solution to, and how?
759460501667536896 2016-07-30 18:47:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy When they're winning an argument.... *hint* That's what just happened.
759459154687762436 2016-07-30 18:42:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy Also, those voter ID laws aren't an attempt by the GOP to game the system at all, right? Riiiight...
759458732874960896 2016-07-30 18:40:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy Uh-huh....and you have evidence of illegal immigrants ACTUALLY VOTING, right? No? Didn't think so...
759448405458296832 2016-07-30 17:59:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy I love the grand assumptions you're making based on no evidence whatsoever. It's both funny and sad.
759447721304403968 2016-07-30 17:57:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy Right....and you know this how?
759239049664159744 2016-07-29 04:07:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy @ConservativeJZN Where is there evidence of that happening now? Or ever? Beyond possibly an isolated case....
759218798595563521 2016-07-29 02:47:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy I believe you should have to show some form of ID. The list of acceptable IDs however, should be long, not short
759217660102057985 2016-07-29 02:42:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy Neither of those things are rights as  citizens.
759216586423169024 2016-07-29 02:38:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy The % of the population that go to the club on Friday nights is pretty small, brother.
759216269535084544 2016-07-29 02:37:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy I didn't say show no ID at all
759213879457112066 2016-07-29 02:27:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy ....not harder.
759213823727403008 2016-07-29 02:27:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy Lastly, since voting is the right & duty of every citizen 18 & over, we should be making it as easy as possible.
759213449188605955 2016-07-29 02:26:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy Also, we're talking about legislating a solution to a problem that rarely pops up. This is never a good plan.
759212958488616960 2016-07-29 02:24:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy One can do that without having to obtain one of a limited list of arbitrarily approved IDs.
759211733433065476 2016-07-29 02:19:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy ....not a right.
759211660531888128 2016-07-29 02:18:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy ok....the 1st place to start, I think, would be to understand that ordering an alcoholic beverage is a privilege
759210024770174976 2016-07-29 02:12:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NotKennyRogers @cowboytroy Yeah.....and?
759163764197380096 2016-07-29 23:08:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @thehill No, she's right. She just neglects to mention that the people who have those questions are ones who are ignoring science
759147424585699328 2016-07-29 22:03:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KnowTheGame60 @Bitterwhiteguy @dallasnews It's ok to move out of your lane, but this is careening into a ditch.
759146762351161344 2016-07-29 22:01:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jmalewitz @Bitterwhiteguy @WWMcClyde Probably right....I remember Jim Mattox, but not much about him.
759146483379675136 2016-07-29 22:00:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @Sullivan_Ranger From what I've seen. The price tags for both are simply too high, IMO....

758863178096791553 2016-07-28 03:14:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I completely agree. She's delivering the speech about as well as she can. Her strength has been/is doing the work.
758862776408289281 2016-07-28 03:12:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris It's just not her strength....never has been.

758855275474358273 2016-07-28 02:42:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @insanityreport When you look at total votes and delegates, it was a solid win, but not a blowout. Agree to disagree....
758855053713088512 2016-07-28 02:41:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @insanityreport @sherrodharris The difference is his supporters need A LOT more convincing to support Hillary than Hillary's did for Obama

758673282522423296 2016-07-28 14:39:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheLaw36 Telling someone to "stick to sports" is basically telling them they shouldn't express an opinion on anything other than sports.
758669314018848768 2016-07-28 14:23:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheLaw36 Hopefully, someone will do the same for you if another person tries to tell you that you aren't allowed an opinion on something.

758135299864088576 2016-07-26 03:01:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Problem is, if you believe all the stories, he's "let her down" multiple times, so you have to consider that.
758134961987657730 2016-07-26 03:00:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I think the long story of how they met, how he got her to marry him, & how good of a mother she was did the job fine.

758121120520286208 2016-07-26 02:05:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HiMyNameIsSeton @mmfa *Facepalm* sigh....
758107837255921664 2016-07-26 01:12:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> It was really enjoyable reading @mcuban school @FreemanWSJ just now....
758105714480914434 2016-07-26 01:04:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mcuban @FreemanWSJ You're completely deflecting the question Mr. Freeman. Did you or anyone at the WSJ do their job & contact the other 8?
758100732239159296 2016-07-26 00:44:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde gotcha, lol
758099507544399873 2016-07-26 00:39:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport address?
758098526169554945 2016-07-26 00:35:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AnwarRichardson No onions, extra mozz, mustard blend....double meat if you're feeling bold.
758098248519122944 2016-07-26 00:34:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I missed this. Inform, please?
758097814140235776 2016-07-26 00:32:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde But unfortunately, the general public has lost the ability to compartmentalize.
758097689976279040 2016-07-26 00:32:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde One would think so. It's just like '08
758056012884484096 2016-07-26 21:46:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Lana Joey Gallo got called up! :-)
758054848486977538 2016-07-26 21:42:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Or they think Profar is ready for some OF work...
758054491660783616 2016-07-26 21:40:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @gfraley @WWMcClyde This could be due to impending Gallo arrival for tonight, no?
758054299402248192 2016-07-26 21:40:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway One would think, if they're sending Hoying down....
758053547002867712 2016-07-26 21:37:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @billyontheradio @annehudson @AJIsTheReal I find it very appropriate
758005411186290688 2016-07-26 18:25:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving The league just needs to quit testing for it
758005147037339648 2016-07-26 18:24:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving That makes no sense....

757981979346284544 2016-07-26 16:52:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr the "Bernie or Bust" crowd is starting to resemble the Tea Party in behavior and attitude
757781513429618689 2016-07-25 03:36:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm All my prayers and positive thoughts, Jayme....
757779134525284353 2016-07-25 03:26:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Correct....and I feel pretty confident in saying that I bet most, if not all, Harvard professors do pretty well.
757778734074114049 2016-07-25 03:25:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris Thank you. It's like people think she didn't work her way up to teaching at HARVARD!!
757776334957404160 2016-07-25 03:15:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball A turning of the worm, perhaps?
757775205259444224 2016-07-25 03:11:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway The criticisms of him are just downright stupid. He needs to be more economical with his pitches, yes....but come on.
757767757496668160 2016-07-25 02:41:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MattWalshBlog You win today's  "Dumbest tweet" award....congrats.

757695529631363072 2016-07-25 21:54:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser I've been trying to catch up on this, but is there ANY evidence that anyone in the DNC did any ACTUAL election tampering?
757691370278490112 2016-07-25 21:37:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser And I understand why, but the reality of the situation is still them same. She going to be the nominee.
757689334464024577 2016-07-25 21:29:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Russian_Starr @FeministaJones @patrickgotti Have you completely igorned the history of the last 50 years?
757688805885288448 2016-07-25 21:27:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @jasonnobleDMR @chris_laursen Then you don't really believe in what Bernie stood for.
757688544944988161 2016-07-25 21:26:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KeithOlbermann @Lawrence Is there ANY evidence in ANY of these emails that ANYONE in the DNC did any ACTUAL election tampering?
757687858744340480 2016-07-25 21:23:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser You know where I stand, brother, and defeating #DishonestDonald has to be priority No. 1. The reality is Hillary is the nominee

757642425997287425 2016-07-25 18:23:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Lawrence Is there evidence that anyone in the DNC actually, physically did anything to affect the outcome of any primaries or caucuses?
757275778648150016 2016-07-24 18:06:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival @MIZ_ZOU12 Ok, Mizzou....keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better.
757271530564820993 2016-07-24 17:49:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AlbertBreer @AnnCoulter Doubtful....she's said much worse.

757064373907001344 2016-07-23 04:06:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser Justin Lin is a "Fast and the Furious" guy. You won't get smarts.

756983928817262592 2016-07-23 22:46:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway I would hope you're correct
756851442036543488 2016-07-23 14:00:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChrisMosser I approve this message....
756626165297741825 2016-07-22 23:05:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball How odd....
756618519052034049 2016-07-22 22:34:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHCougarFB My apologies. I misread your original tweet. I thought you said Top 20 games, not just Top 10. My fault....
756616882443030528 2016-07-22 22:28:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHCougarFB @gregfenves I looked at an independent article
756616835987021824 2016-07-22 22:28:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHCougarFB @gregfenves And I'm sure UH didn't try and skew the numbers to make themselves look better at all, right?

756507088185094144 2016-07-22 15:11:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves actually it was much more Bob Bullock & one of the powerful state senators, but the point is the same
756506116452868097 2016-07-22 15:08:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves LMAO....ok you were doing ok until this
756496846076248064 2016-07-22 14:31:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher @rtraister She strikes me a  true moderate conservative
756353407011606528 2016-07-21 05:01:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris I don't think those words mean what they think they mean. #MyNamIsInigoMontoya
756250294174912512 2016-07-21 22:11:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean @billmcraven @UHouston I'm telling you.....it's reverse psychology.

756242864971976704 2016-07-21 21:42:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AutulloAAS I'm starting to feel that there's some serious reverse psychology going on here....
756241210017058816 2016-07-21 21:35:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin @UHouston You're right in that there are no unicorns, but that doesn't mean UH is a better option than some OOS schools
756240508481961985 2016-07-21 21:32:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves @Thomas_Marr Even when comparing histories, it's a bad comparison.
756240334913277952 2016-07-21 21:32:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves You're right about the SEC, but incorrect about the other. UH had 2 top 20, Big 12 had 7.
756238948767141888 2016-07-21 21:26:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves @Thomas_Marr Are you seriously trying to compare USC and UH?
756237901457924097 2016-07-21 21:22:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves Tier 1 and Ck?
756237450591232000 2016-07-21 21:20:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves @Thomas_Marr No it doesn't, because they didn't exapnd them to a P5 level. This just shows you don't know what I mean.
756236295001739265 2016-07-21 21:15:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckCarltonDMN @DanPatrick @GregAbbott_TX @UHouston Well, he's wrong too, but then....that nothing remotely unusual.
756232969015046144 2016-07-21 21:02:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jake_Trotter @chrisgb00 @TilmanJFertitta @gregfenves @UHouston @UTAustin He's right....they sure can't.
756232558510080000 2016-07-21 21:01:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gregfenves @UHouston Academics: Incorrect (look up rankings), TV market: Incorrect, Program on the rise: Doesn't matter
756231330292125696 2016-07-21 20:56:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves @Doc_Texas Those would be my 1st two choices if they're dead set on expanding.
756230181048561664 2016-07-21 20:51:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> This....https://twitter.com/JenksCSN/status/756229549344653312
756229972352565248 2016-07-21 20:50:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves @Doc_Texas I disagree on both Memphis & Cincy, not that I like either. At least those two would bring a new TV market
756229201561202692 2016-07-21 20:47:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves Feel free to respond and provide examples as to HOW Houston is a "huge asset"....
756228548847820805 2016-07-21 20:45:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean @gregfenves @UHouston And just like with the Baylor supporters in '95, people supporting Houston here are wrong.
756228151374585856 2016-07-21 20:43:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves @Thomas_Marr "Currently" doesn't mean jack when it comes to conference expansion and the overall big picture.
756227854749151232 2016-07-21 20:42:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves @Bitterwhiteguy @ChrisMosser I fully believe this is a political move/stance from the Governor. @GregAbbott_TX
756227623265640449 2016-07-21 20:41:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GregAbbott_TX @chrisgb00 @UHouston @bevobeat Why? I implore you to explain this position with examples of what benefits they would provide.
756227292280479744 2016-07-21 20:40:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves @Bitterwhiteguy @ChrisMosser Exactly.... UH provides no benefit to the University of Texas or the Big 12
756225808172068866 2016-07-21 20:34:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckCarltonDMN @gregfenves @UHouston Sure, it's interesting....even if he is wrong.
756225355527036928 2016-07-21 20:32:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones Nothing. They don't provide anything substantive as far as the big picture is concerned.
756224910289100804 2016-07-21 20:30:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @UHouston @gregfenves I respectfully disagree. As far as big picture is concerned, I don't see what they provide that is a benefit to Big 12
756218079508467713 2016-07-21 20:03:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> I love it when you're debating someone, they ask for specific examples to back up your position, you do so, & they don't reply. #DontTestMe

756169926348464128 2016-07-21 16:52:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OTLonESPN @OurDailyBears @jeffreypaschal but the coaches didn't do that
756000152876232708 2016-07-20 05:37:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Playahhatah75 @unclebarkycom It's also very possible Colbert didn't know about the shirt's meaning since it had a Mavs logo on it.
755999345246281728 2016-07-20 05:34:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @unclebarkycom @colbertlateshow @Playahhatah75 Doubtful....I just think since Cuban knows Trump so well that's what he wanted to focus on.
755997883040620545 2016-07-20 05:28:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mrBobbyBones @Betsyacastillo Good move, brother....
755996760414097408 2016-07-20 05:24:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @unclebarkycom I do get it. I just think you expected too much, considering the circumstances of the show.
755995691697082368 2016-07-20 05:19:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @unclebarkycom These are his live RNC shows. Cuban knows Trump well. If you expected the segment to not be RNC-centric you expected too much
755989451269140480 2016-07-20 04:55:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @unclebarkycom @Jeff_Caplan No, I understand his point. I just think he's not looking at the other side of it. These are Colbert's RNC shows
755988982484262913 2016-07-20 04:53:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @unclebarkycom @Jeff_Caplan You do know Cuban lived/went to college in Indiana, right?
755988125432684544 2016-07-20 04:49:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CNN @realJeffreyLord You continue to make an abject fool of yourself every time yo appear on TV. @cnn should be ashamed for employing you.
755950591298252800 2016-07-20 02:20:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway I'm going to disagree with you on this. Profar obviously isn't ready to play OF, otherwise they would have put him out there
755949577077784576 2016-07-20 02:16:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Then you'd have Profar and Gallo BOTH being in the same situation Profar had been in for the last few weeks. Why do that?
755948762443321344 2016-07-20 02:13:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Alberto is there for bench depth....nothing more. We both know that. You don't call up Gallo just to be bench depth.
755947302355775489 2016-07-20 02:07:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway He's worked there, but obviously not ready to play there. My guess is Profar is going to get a lot of his ABs at DH.
755946404619497472 2016-07-20 02:04:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Where? If they're planning on giving Profar more ABs now (which they should), where would he get consistent PT?
755939702117576705 2016-07-20 01:37:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde *Raise a glass*.....
755938824555859968 2016-07-20 01:33:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Meh....
755933239487803392 2016-07-20 01:11:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @IngrahamAngle That fact that you can't see or understand why he's not attending tells me that you're the short-sighted one.
755926780771348480 2016-07-20 00:46:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @billmaher Please never have @WayneRoot on your show again. He is the most full-of-complete-horseshit guest I've ever seen you have on.
755907392617918468 2016-07-20 23:29:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway ok then, it still doesn't change my opinion. Moreland will be gone after this season. Gallo is the replacement.
755906774796873729 2016-07-20 23:26:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @onestrikeaway What were the reasons then?
755906450996670464 2016-07-20 23:25:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @onestrikeaway How do you know they benched him?
755906212525322240 2016-07-20 23:24:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @onestrikeaway I still think he's the starting 1B next year.
755906109752225792 2016-07-20 23:23:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant @onestrikeaway What I've seen is, they want him to have as much consistent playing time as possible. Right now, that's in RR.
755905627944198149 2016-07-20 23:22:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @Evan_P_Grant I don't agree
755879663126188033 2016-07-20 21:38:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OurDailyBears Read pages 10-12 of the Baylor University Board of Regents Findings of Fact, Re: Pepper Hamilton Report
755849787333672960 2016-07-20 19:40:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OurDailyBears Are Reagan Ramsower and Bethany McCraw still employed by Baylor?
755847280138170369 2016-07-20 19:30:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChipBrownHD also, the name of that woman who originally "investigated" one of the rape claims that was in the Texas monthly article?
755847144108544000 2016-07-20 19:29:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChipBrownHD what's the name of the Baylor admin that was in charge of setting up the Title IX office, that is still employed by Baylor?
755845959142166528 2016-07-20 19:24:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @OurDailyBears @OTLonESPN Now you just need to fire the coaches that covered things up & the admins who didn't setup correct infrastructure

755418468149637122 2016-07-19 15:06:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KnowTheGame60 Did you see what Paul Ryan said to the group of Texas delegates?
755416422407299074 2016-07-19 14:58:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert I'm literally STUNNED that he used that as an example of unity when talking to a group of TEXANS!!!
755416170925129728 2016-07-19 14:57:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @injuryexpert @JTiloveTX @SpeakerRyan RIGHT???
755414911136608256 2016-07-19 14:52:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> I don't think @SpeakerRyan could have chosen a worse analogy to present to Texans as an example of unity. Wow....https://twitter.com/JosephTexDozier/status/755390948603854848

755407662716628992 2016-07-19 14:23:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd @AutulloAAS Yes. I love the "I don't like that question, so you're not a real journalist" attitude.
755406629948882946 2016-07-19 14:19:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AutulloAAS @kylefredrickson The question is valid. Just because you don't agree with the question doesn't lessen the quality of it.

754711770011357184 2016-07-17 16:18:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris What do they want him to do, exactly? Anyone who thinks he doesn't FULLY support police simply doesn't like him.

753448743693787138 2016-07-13 04:39:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gordonkeith Conservative talk radio would say he wasn't conservative enough to be considered a real "evangelical"

753299052163248129 2016-07-13 18:44:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen the players have another option.... It's called a strike. However, the players don't have the will or fortitude to do it.
753072168569679873 2016-07-12 03:42:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JYSexton At least this one is somewhat understandable.

753046460418002944 2016-07-12 02:00:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs It's an intentional foul. Just treat it as such and there's no issue.
753046109526691840 2016-07-12 01:59:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MFollowill If they had just treated this like it should be from the beginning, which is an intentional foul, there would be no issue.

753032408287420416 2016-07-12 01:04:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Deadspin @chrisgb00 I would call their efforts 'misguided', but your site's labeling and description of them is inaccurate and hyperbolic.
753027354117615617 2016-07-12 00:44:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch Why are you losing brain cells listening to his nonsense?

753017737945882624 2016-07-12 00:06:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs Yeah, it's weird, because they're playing with AL rules too. (DH)
753015125049610240 2016-07-12 23:56:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong Coach, is the future so bright you had to wear shades?

752978022102212608 2016-07-12 21:28:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> To @DPDChief, @Mike_Rawlings, officers Aherns, Krol, Smith, Thompson, Zamarripa & their familes, & all those injured https://youtu.be/KWhMyOs0pCQ
752959426814889985 2016-07-12 20:14:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MFollowill I thought both he and Pres. Bush did fantastic jobs. Bush's line about how we judge others and ourselves was awesomely on point
752957700032430080 2016-07-12 20:07:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarackObama @iamdave @jamie_batiste HA!!!
752957556344008705 2016-07-12 20:07:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jtLOL @DailyCaller Once again....you obviously chose not to actually LISTEN.
752957116172767233 2016-07-12 20:05:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jtLOL @DailyCaller If you thought he was scolding police, then you weren't listening....or chose not to.
752956753608740864 2016-07-12 20:04:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gordonkeith @jrqberry It's kind of like being "Line 4 Guy"

752955241675444224 2016-07-12 19:58:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @iamdave @jamie_batiste @BarackObama LOL *facepalm*
752955091703902208 2016-07-12 19:57:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> I love people who delete their tweets after they realize they were assholes.....like they somehow didn't happen.
752953275771531264 2016-07-12 19:50:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris It's amazing how many people didn't really LISTEN to what he said. @benfergusonshow
752951930444316672 2016-07-12 19:45:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Lawrence I thought President Bush did an excellent job as well
752949820885565442 2016-07-12 19:36:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> And one again, Dallas Mayor @Mike_Rawlings and DPD Chief @DPDChief were examples of leadership in crisis.
752949084416122880 2016-07-12 19:33:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> I thought #POTUS @BarackObama and former POTUS #GeorgeWBush both spoke very eloquently and struck the necessary tones.
752948033646571521 2016-07-12 19:29:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Yeah, the ones who didn't, and weren't going to, listen had their retorts ready before he even spoke.
752943620513157120 2016-07-12 19:12:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> She needs to be quiet and go back to the kids table.

752628916573966336 2016-07-11 22:21:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @larryelder Yeah, because all that changes his skin color, right? Larry isn't very smart.

752619659841511424 2016-07-11 21:44:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LukeRussert @benpershing Correct. The President, from the beginning, wanted a public option in the bill.
752548683695075329 2016-07-11 17:02:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @Jenn_Abrams Jenna Abrams obviously doesn't....
752503365385359360 2016-07-11 14:02:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN @mj_lee I just replied to her with this exact point
752498797020712961 2016-07-11 13:44:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mj_lee I'm sure this poll is valid since the majority of Americans fully understand all the laws and procedures involved, right? #Sarcasm
752340610401447936 2016-07-10 03:15:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> While I disagree with @GregAbbott_TX politically, I applaud his ability to make his personal pain secondary and hope his recovery goes well.
751993722800250880 2016-07-09 04:17:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball He got squeezed there....according to the pitch tracker, at least.

751962972264624130 2016-07-09 02:15:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NicoleDarin I hope she's aware just how much you truly love her, because THAT is love. ;-)
751959374369660929 2016-07-09 02:01:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JenksCSN @NicoleDarin You've made me so sad....
751958410191515648 2016-07-09 01:57:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NicoleDarin Toby Keith?? That Sooner-loving goon?? *Facepalm*....I don't even know you anymore.
751876719766757376 2016-07-09 20:32:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Apdirtybird @Bitterwhiteguy @joshtpm @TPM This might be the most moronic law passed in the last half-century.
751875141685043200 2016-07-09 20:26:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @catosterman One reason I've never been a big autograph guy...didn't want to hassle. I'd rather say hi & meet someone if opportunity exists.

751610348965289984 2016-07-08 02:54:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @towershots I'm crossing my fingers that the HS coach's pass works again.

751581718402899968 2016-07-08 01:00:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He can throw it 120 in a game, so hopefully he settles in.
751575071005614080 2016-07-08 00:33:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> I know I don't have all the answers, but I think I know where to start. The word I keep thinking of is 'humanity'. We need to rediscover it.
751570694266232832 2016-07-08 00:16:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde DPD is keeping things quiet about the others that are in custody. Smart move...

751569406115782656 2016-07-08 00:11:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde what would they be justifying in this case? I missed that....
751565748733038593 2016-07-08 23:56:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde MSM?
751549046246895616 2016-07-08 22:50:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN Similar to the 2nd amendment, it's people who don't truly understand it's meaning and purpose.
751463380678905857 2016-07-08 17:10:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RepRWilliams You should be ashamed of yourself for that statement on the Dallas tragedy. I'm embarrassed that you represent Austin.
751459350238023685 2016-07-08 16:54:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN @AdamButler__ You're correct, but broadcasting that speech over the airwaves is a privilege, not a right.
751432769331302400 2016-07-08 15:08:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheMarkHenry It was cool to hear you the last couple of mornings holding things down with Chip. I hope all is well, brother....
751286237906870272 2016-07-07 05:26:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I will drive to Houston to produce it.....no BS
751217583727058944 2016-07-07 00:53:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway He looked like a solid MLB pitcher though....
751217274455863296 2016-07-07 00:52:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Apparently this applies to bunting against that shift as well....
751217010885873664 2016-07-07 00:51:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway The way Chi Chi looked last year, I can understand that. He's really regressed this year.
751216628663087104 2016-07-07 00:49:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball He had to go towards the gap to get that hit....so there really wasn't a play, especially since he's a lefty.
751212695219675136 2016-07-07 00:33:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bkaucher @McClain_on_NFL I wish I could say I had the utmost confidence that won't happen, but.....college football.

750542491766710272 2016-07-05 04:10:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jamie_batiste I don't mind that one bit..... #FanOfChokers   Wait.....that didn't come out quite right. Twitter please delete!!
750540870336864256 2016-07-05 04:04:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DianaMoskovitz They got off incredibly light. Baylor won't be so lucky....
750540421986680832 2016-07-05 04:02:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> Today was one helluva day. That is all.....
750532525307465728 2016-07-05 03:31:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thehill You have GOT to be fucking kidding me.... @WWMcClyde @dick_nixon
750519976587436032 2016-07-05 02:41:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway He was already warming in the 9th before the offense put up 4, and he hadn't pitched since Friday.
750506551668936704 2016-07-05 01:48:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball Brock Landers
750502561048694784 2016-07-05 01:32:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport @BenRogers @lonestarball What would the estimated costs be for the various Yankee RPs?
750490916352208896 2016-07-05 00:45:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Well, the pitching injuries have caught up to them over the last 10 days.
750484539823173633 2016-07-05 00:20:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @WWMcClyde I just mean he would've been worthy of a selection.
750484278748729344 2016-07-05 00:19:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball If Colby hadn't gotten hurt....
750480940401430528 2016-07-05 00:06:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball There's an argument for Beltre, but that's about it.
750434294263271424 2016-07-05 21:00:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> This is absolutely spectacular!! Well done @JohnCena #Americahttps://twitter.com/JohnCena/status/749936149481656320
750432452477198337 2016-07-05 20:53:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal yes and no
750432237850533893 2016-07-05 20:52:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Low blow....and an inaccurate one.
750431664606572544 2016-07-05 20:50:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @marvg22 Yeah....it was a big mutha.
750431424113586180 2016-07-05 20:49:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Thanks.....and it was (pretty close to) burnt orange, and it was beautiful.
750427464728350720 2016-07-05 20:33:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong Coach, my beautiful orange car had this done to it (and me) today. Any helpful advice....or hookups?pic.twitter.com/zeCLLnTkFV

750041038757064704 2016-07-04 18:58:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SportsSturm @aandro and average to below-average MLB pitchers
750040807890038784 2016-07-04 18:57:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde The Rangers are in survival mode until the ASB
750039951517949953 2016-07-04 18:53:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> Of course not. I just hadn't heard about a 2nd player.
750039770626076672 2016-07-04 18:53:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NewbergReport The Rangers are just trying to get through this week. Reinforcements should be ready after the ASB.
750036361944571904 2016-07-04 18:39:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> Meh....
750020415800565760 2016-07-04 17:36:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Hey, it was only about 2 1/2 years, dammit....

750019455963402240 2016-07-04 17:32:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> who is the 2nd?
750019351286210561 2016-07-04 17:32:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal People don't always appreciate the gig they have.
750019240841744384 2016-07-04 17:31:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I would drive to Houston and do it for if I wasn't working.
749822790312693760 2016-07-03 04:30:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StevensonFWST Your original tweet was not mysogynistic. It was insulting, but not mysoginistic.
749688615106596864 2016-07-03 19:37:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @theswampfox76 @WillMcAvoyACN Even if you give him benefit of the doubt (you shouldn't), it still makes him titanically stupid for using it.
749679401613144064 2016-07-03 19:01:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WillMcAvoyACN @theswampfox76 Hence being titanically stupid....
749668905115750401 2016-07-03 18:19:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @theswampfox76 @WillMcAvoyACN So he's either anti-Semitic or titanically stupid. Is that right? What a lovely representative for the GOP.
749613183850016769 2016-07-03 14:38:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @elkpga Actually, yes....she does have a choice.
749360892664438784 2016-07-02 21:55:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Lin_Manuel @HamiltonMusical @Richard_Schiff I truly hope I get to see this piece of brilliant theater one day.
749360316954185728 2016-07-02 21:53:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @swish41 Congratulations, brother!
749358937305001984 2016-07-02 21:47:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball You can tell they're just trying to hang on until then.
749358642818797568 2016-07-02 21:46:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Better than Cuban....  He's waiting for Morey to finish so he can pick from those leftovers.

749289381492453376 2016-07-02 17:11:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Well there you go. Having that knowledge makes him saying that even more reprehensible
749288593282043904 2016-07-02 17:08:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Oh, don't get it twisted....saying that is jacked up. I just meant that his statement was technically accurate.
749287527140302848 2016-07-02 17:04:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde They don't NEED to be in a good school? Hmm....I guess technically he's right, but wouldn't a good father want that?
749066845546647552 2016-07-01 02:27:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sbass1310 yeah....except for that
749063083402809350 2016-07-01 02:12:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Took one for the team....attaboy.
749062531616940032 2016-07-01 02:09:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway How many times do I need to tell you to....  Just. Be. Happy???
749062273260359680 2016-07-01 02:08:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GirlfriendKim @Tierra_Mala I wish I was a beneficiary of your culinary skills this evening. :-)
749060843812196352 2016-07-01 02:03:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @Klane00 @StevensonFWST Chirinos is the best defensive catcher of the 3. He also has the most power.
749060104121511936 2016-07-01 02:00:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball I don't suppose Chirinos has options, does he?
749059679158886400 2016-07-01 01:58:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball Davidson is struggling tonight
749059061438488576 2016-07-01 01:56:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball Yeah....it's time to make a call there.
748955028283535360 2016-07-01 19:02:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @igorvolsky I'm sure that will go well....
748879534015909890 2016-07-01 14:02:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SkinWade I understand. It's hard to see your long-lost brother leave when you just finally found one another.
748615841990664192 2016-06-30 20:34:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GirlfriendKim ok then....that's one way to go.
748609186339008512 2016-06-30 20:08:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> Attn: @dallascowboys staff, Re: #RolondoMcClain... THIS is why using 2nd-rd picks on fixer-uppers w/high upside every year is a bad idea.
748602596978368513 2016-06-30 19:42:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway @WWMcClyde Command is what I was going for....not control. My fault.
748602240466718720 2016-06-30 19:40:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @onestrikeaway This is why another LHRP should be the 1st priority in a trade
748601973901910016 2016-06-30 19:39:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @onestrikeaway His stuff is fine. His control has left him.
748601647702511616 2016-06-30 19:38:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd It looked crazy on draft day.
748561393339637760 2016-06-30 16:58:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I think they need depth. Kela should be back after ASB. Tolley is pitching better. Need another reliable lefty...maybe one more
748557457564151810 2016-06-30 16:43:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @BNightengale Here's the question, do you go after an established closer or just middle relief help?
748557054948708352 2016-06-30 16:41:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @rwallacekxan Uh-huh.....
748556153668263936 2016-06-30 16:37:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 @espnpic.twitter.com/zz7cD31wFE
748377420701511680 2016-06-29 04:47:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway I'd give Tolley some 8th inning work for sure right now.
748377043197386753 2016-06-29 04:46:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Kela should be back after the ASB
748376797889372160 2016-06-29 04:45:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Yeah, pitching McCann in was strange to me.
748376503755374592 2016-06-29 04:43:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway All-Star Break is 2 weeks out. I think Diekman & Bush need a few days off more than Dyson. Give Tolley another shot?
748375801725337600 2016-06-29 04:41:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway I agree, but sometimes that's just baseball. Some nights you're just off. The HR Didi hit wasn't a bad pitch. He just got it.
748374994472869888 2016-06-29 04:37:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde The bullpen needs help. There's no two ways about this.
748374772938047488 2016-06-29 04:37:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Not that I don't agree, but he didn't pitch the entire Boston series or yesterday. So he's had 5 of the last 7 days off.
748336270007406597 2016-06-29 02:04:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps If there was ever a year for it....
748335452164284416 2016-06-29 02:00:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymohr37 Cowherd?? Ugh....
748262007065894912 2016-06-29 21:08:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr Texas also had some attrition this spring/summer which gave them room to take multiple of these kids if they wanted to come here
748261554106183680 2016-06-29 21:07:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr As I said, Texas was high on all 4 kids' lists before NSD. Also, coming off of NSD, Texas still has lots of recruiting momentum.
748260918786547712 2016-06-29 21:04:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr I still know people in media, but I haven't been in the industry for over 5 years.
748256756430577665 2016-06-29 20:48:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr Not really. If youve followed recruiting. The info is out there.
748255293545447424 2016-06-29 20:42:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr It's a multi-faceted answer, some of the facets of which, I have already stated here.
748238239660548096 2016-06-29 19:34:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr He didn't outwork everone since Martin is going to Auburn & Cobb to OU, but you're still suggesting underhanded actions occurred.
748236235601149952 2016-06-29 19:26:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr He still might not make it past this season if they don't win games, but he's been an A+ recruiter his entire career.
748226928369274880 2016-06-29 18:49:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr A question of what? These were ALL kids that Strong was in on originally. He outworked the other coaches.
748226037889130500 2016-06-29 18:46:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr As far as the Duvernay twins go, they want to go to school together. UT didn't have a scholly for Donovan in Feb. They do now.
748225515312472065 2016-06-29 18:43:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr Cobb is probably going to OU
748223914862510081 2016-06-29 18:37:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr 1st of all, it's 4 not 5. 2nd, when you consider that Texas was originally Hudson's & Urquidez's 2nd choices, it's not that weird
748212815320645632 2016-06-29 17:53:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots #Errbody
748212368442691584 2016-06-29 17:51:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr I'm glad that you aren't one, and the reason there are crickets is because there is no basis in fact to support that conspiracy
748204021656104960 2016-06-29 17:18:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr Don't be that guy, Daniel.

747972104251834368 2016-06-28 01:57:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway it just seems like he could use a few days off just like Dyson had
747971538633187328 2016-06-28 01:54:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway There should have been no diekman in the 8th
747971380956672001 2016-06-28 01:54:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 hey, thumbs up to the kid... It got him one-on-one interview with @KayleeHartung #DontHateThePlayaHateTheGame

747856727186378752 2016-06-28 18:18:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd Google Chromecast, XBOX 1, PS 4....etc
747856333978800129 2016-06-28 18:16:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd Look into Apple TV, Roku, Amazon....they all have similar products that use streaming services
747855268373893120 2016-06-28 18:12:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd I like U-VERSE, but it all depends on what & how you watch your TV. If the only live TV you watch is sports, go Sling/Roku/etc.

747530477574098944 2016-06-27 20:42:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @BarkingCarnival Wolken has basically said that Texas fans are only up in arms about the Baylor scandal for football reasons

745452866299539458 2016-06-21 03:06:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jamie_batiste @WWMcClyde Sound advice from a true sage....
745451354794000384 2016-06-21 03:00:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JoeyBats19 @jamie_batiste I'll put in a good word....

745449721494265856 2016-06-21 02:53:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB Compared to them, we are amateurs.
745449585967915011 2016-06-21 02:53:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> .@JoeyBats19 just started following me. Um.....thanks? #UnsureHowToRespond @WWMcClyde @lonestarball @NewbergReport
745448329526423553 2016-06-21 02:48:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @joshtpm as someone already tweeted, "Bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see how it works out for them."
745442265397497857 2016-06-21 02:24:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @JoshTheiss He has come up small in  A LOT of big games
745441625225105409 2016-06-21 02:21:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters Argentina is just way better. They're the #1 team in the world for a reason.
745441136735444993 2016-06-21 02:19:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WhitlockJason @tyduffy we do not....especially with the suspensions.
745440991310581760 2016-06-21 02:19:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump @jaymohr37 The answer to your questions are no, he doesn't....and yes, he is.
745439159838347264 2016-06-21 02:11:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HiMyNameIsSeton I know Florio is one of your boys, but the shade from @ProFootballTalk was misplaced in this situation.
745438840509235201 2016-06-21 02:10:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @HiMyNameIsSeton Does Florio run their twitter account?
745436964011159553 2016-06-21 02:03:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ProFootballTalk Once more....for emphasis....your shade is greatly misplaced here.
745434908244357120 2016-06-21 01:55:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ProFootballTalk @JJWatt Your shade is STILL greatly misplaced here

745432444912820224 2016-06-21 01:45:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> That goal from #Messi was the soccer equivalent of the Crane Kick from "Karate Kid" #USAvARG
745431131479146497 2016-06-21 01:40:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @neftalirr Few? I'd argue none. That was the Soccer equivalent of the crane kick from Karate Kid
745429875561922560 2016-06-21 01:35:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @uttailgaters More a "hang on for dear life and try to survive" strategy
745429396903723009 2016-06-21 01:33:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 @JTMarsh1 If some of our best athletes decide they want to play soccer... sure.
745429254389698560 2016-06-21 01:32:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @tweetgrubes Oh come on now...
745428959467212800 2016-06-21 01:31:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DMcComasOB That's easy....he was indecisive and he froze.
745423838427549696 2016-06-21 01:11:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 I'm no soccer expert, and even I know the answer is yes.
745422767391047684 2016-06-21 01:06:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> Ok #USMNT.....KEEP IT CLOSE!!! #RealisticExpectations #USAvARG
745344533731246080 2016-06-21 19:55:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I truly believe it's some kind of mental defect with him. He simply cannot help himself/stop himself from lying CONSTANTLY.
745313358983790593 2016-06-21 17:52:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith That would offend me.

745103088277544960 2016-06-20 03:56:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jamie_batiste As long as their heart was in the right place, I guess....
745102365989052417 2016-06-20 03:53:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jamie_batiste What kind of friend gives eff-ed up advice like that?? #NotARealFriend
745102018704859136 2016-06-20 03:52:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers Stubb's Beef Marinade is pretty damn good as well. If you haven't tired that yet, I highly recommend it.
745091990681837568 2016-06-20 03:12:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Well, when the ump puts you down 2-0 instead of up 0-2 because he doesn't know the strike zone....
745089239616880641 2016-06-20 03:01:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Rangers @Bannyrooster28 @injuryexpert If he's going well? Not at all....
745088571594309634 2016-06-20 02:58:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball Tolleson and Barnett going 3.2 scoreless tonight is potentially huge news for the @Rangers bullpen
745082235611557888 2016-06-20 02:33:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bannyrooster28 @injuryexpert If he can get back to form, it will be huge for the @Rangers bullpen depth.
745082029012725760 2016-06-20 02:32:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bannyrooster28 @injuryexpert He's been solid since he came back.
745081333337071616 2016-06-20 02:30:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Alyssa_Milano @Everytown Unfortunately, I think we can pretty much guess correctly without looking. #Enough

744683920965308416 2016-06-19 00:10:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasRec @EricNahlin @drryanpepper When I say MJ is a better shooter, I'm talking about overall. He was a more consistent shooter than LBJ
744670924327133184 2016-06-19 23:19:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @USGA @dick_nixon The @usga has gone clown show....

744667853714919424 2016-06-19 23:07:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasRec @EricNahlin @drryanpepper I would argue MJ is also a better shooter

744608426068586496 2016-06-19 19:10:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 I have a softball game at 4....
744608158073577472 2016-06-19 19:09:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde When Nomar had runners on the corners, 2 out, & the Cardinals shifted on the IF, why not try and push a bunt to 3rd for an RBI?
744606235396177921 2016-06-19 19:02:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Jacques_Rocks sounds just like it's spelled....  (The word) "DEBT''-uh-more
744545415840706563 2016-06-19 15:00:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @Jacques_Rocks @NewbergReport I would say Tolley is better, but not ok yet
744527086077902848 2016-06-19 13:47:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @Apdirtybird Bostonians already had the Celtics and Patriots. The Red Sox were the icing. Cleveland hasn't had anything.
744415464713916416 2016-06-18 06:24:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith The ass and not the tits? That is curious....
744388486619246592 2016-06-18 04:36:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde BRILLIANT!!!
744388013690478592 2016-06-18 04:35:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @towershots Which one? I can record the replay...
744380746932981761 2016-06-18 04:06:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde That's one of the best
744377285856264193 2016-06-18 03:52:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I've always liked "nooner"
744377152519479296 2016-06-18 03:51:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde That's impressive.....
744375676405317632 2016-06-18 03:46:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps *jealous*
744357867172433920 2016-06-18 02:35:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> I can imagine
744354465075990529 2016-06-18 02:21:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> Not familiar....
744312793868886016 2016-06-18 23:36:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @RRExpress He's gotta be dinged. He was DH-ing in the game Thursday when he got PH for.
744312344285609988 2016-06-18 23:34:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball How about Tolley gettng the win??
744309109726425088 2016-06-18 23:21:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 The @Rangers scored 2 in the 8th & 9th to come back to win 4-3!!

744307642240143361 2016-06-18 23:15:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball @Evan_P_Grant @SandlerJ Did Banny say Dyson wouldn't be used today, regardless?
744306935961264128 2016-06-18 23:12:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway How would we know. Eff-ing Fox Sports doesn't have it up. Regardless, the ump has been calling those pitches balls.
744306720181149696 2016-06-18 23:12:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball "Strike 2" was borderline. "Strike 3" was ball 4.
744306539624706049 2016-06-18 23:11:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Why? They were both of the zone....especially "strike 3"
744305777066672129 2016-06-18 23:08:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant That guy just saved 2 runs with that catch
744305172646498304 2016-06-18 23:05:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 As soon as this Rangers game ends....
744304460751482880 2016-06-18 23:03:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Rua should have let that pitch hit him
744304259009679360 2016-06-18 23:02:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway I thought he broke the left one.
744304188973146112 2016-06-18 23:02:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway Well, it also gets the tying run to 3rd with one out. I understand the move in that situation.
744303861578371072 2016-06-18 23:00:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway At least it hit the other arm this time
744303564827197441 2016-06-18 22:59:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway They weren't playing for one run. The idea was to put the go-head run into SP with one out.
744284202774913024 2016-06-18 21:42:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Didn't understand starting him at 1B a 2nd straight day....
744284024399552512 2016-06-18 21:41:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 It's a warm one today....
744214861769379841 2016-06-18 17:07:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball Yeah....I don't get it. Not two days in a row.
744049601112608769 2016-06-17 06:10:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GirlfriendKim Yikes....
744048989696327680 2016-06-17 06:07:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @JetSweeps I bet they're not all tiny. Law of averages....
743976826930749441 2016-06-17 01:21:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymelamm The 1st time?? How in the WORLD is that even possible? Btw, all-time fave baseball movies or overall?
743976141149470720 2016-06-17 01:18:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @GregSwindell @DMcComasOB @Beauedge @ATXANT10 @KevinDunn01 Add me to that list

743971169938743297 2016-06-17 00:58:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @InsideTexas @SheaInIrving @WWMcClyde Thank you for sharing

743967442691469312 2016-06-17 00:43:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving @WWMcClyde @InsideTexas I'm on my way now
743967320310046720 2016-06-17 00:43:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving @WWMcClyde @InsideTexas
743953240316747778 2016-06-17 23:47:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball I was at the Express game last night. He got PH for in the 6th. What's up?
743935259905925126 2016-06-17 22:36:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant This is true. Never mentioned perfection either until after the walk.
743934654818881536 2016-06-17 22:33:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @emtfr @WWMcClyde I think it's hilarious when I get blocked by someone I've never even had an exchange with.
743906830837944320 2016-06-17 20:43:04 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken His lawyers threatened a lawsuit, knowing Baylor doesn't want all that info public any more than he does. It worked. $$
743885324175052800 2016-06-17 19:17:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Berkland4 If Baylor is lying publicly about what Pepper Hamilton told them, Pepper Hamilton would have every reason to dispute that
743885119077814272 2016-06-17 19:16:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BradleyBethel @Berkland4 I don't care. We're talking about the Baylor situation, specifically. Stay on topic.
743884697302769664 2016-06-17 19:15:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Berkland4 It is a summary of the oral report that PH gave to the BOR of their findings. Do you see PH disputing what Baylor is saying?
743883710244630532 2016-06-17 19:11:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Berkland4 I don't care about what happened at Penn State. These two situations are not comparable
743882248378679296 2016-06-17 19:05:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Berkland4 so I'll take that as a 'no', you haven't read it.
743881497518571520 2016-06-17 19:02:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Berkland4 You obviously haven't read the 13-page summary of the PH Report that the BOR did release
743876890327293955 2016-06-17 18:44:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Berkland4 When the evidence supports it, yes....and the evidence thus far supports that conclusion.
743873608758370304 2016-06-17 18:31:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Berkland4 Deductive reasoning based on all info that IS available as well as the actions of current & former Baylor employees & associates
743867053308686336 2016-06-17 18:05:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @Berkland4 The fact that you actually believe that is why you are part of the problem, but go ahead & keep telling yourself that.
743865978556080128 2016-06-17 18:00:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @schadjoe That's their problem....too many are still prioritizing their football brand
743865770145251329 2016-06-17 17:59:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving He blocked me, lol....

742157479459446786 2016-06-12 00:51:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> Yes, people are upset that Briles could be back but not for the reasons you think they are, enabler. #Priorities https://twitter.com/BayloRevolution/status/742108896760733696

741762932606803968 2016-06-11 22:43:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Was this on Twitter? What was he on you about? Brock?
741741104945463297 2016-06-11 21:17:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger I would argue the difference is much larger on the pizza side. There are frozen pizzas better than Sbarro.
741739746532069379 2016-06-11 21:11:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Sure it's debatable, just like whether Torchy's or Jack-In-The-Box has better tacos is debatable. It's just not much of a debate
741736962931843072 2016-06-11 21:00:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Maybe he just wanted some Texas BBQ immediately
741736864629940228 2016-06-11 21:00:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger Don't compare Salt Lick to Sbarro. That just not a good comparison.

740702059754708993 2016-06-08 00:28:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He's showing why he needs to be sent back down.

740665351193530369 2016-06-08 22:02:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @dick_nixon @WWMcClyde He will endorse her in the name of uniting the party against Trump. He loathes Trump as much as she does.
740664669682073600 2016-06-08 21:59:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris She really is a waste of oxygen....
740663601069887488 2016-06-08 21:55:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I agree, but they sat each for two games so my guess is Profar is back in the lineup tomorrow.
740622372936388608 2016-06-08 19:11:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @espn975 @The_Raheel as long as you're still allowed to make fun of the Aggies on a daily basis, then you should be alright
740617812360585217 2016-06-08 18:53:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @vicenews For some reason, I just don't believe that.
740610915012206592 2016-06-08 18:26:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @espn975 @The_Raheel What is the Longhorn affiliate in Houston now? Also, will you and @AJIsTheReal resign in protest?

739574251326316545 2016-06-05 21:46:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde I just hope whoever was put into Dutch's body gets to stick around for the rest of the season

739565608698707968 2016-06-05 21:12:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SeanMcElwee @ianbremmer More and more Republicans are proving they care more about party than country.

739563408094158848 2016-06-05 21:03:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jamie_batiste That's better than the "WHY????" I get from my scale. #OutterFatty
739562950839541761 2016-06-05 21:02:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @YouTube There's no question he went too far with Frazier
739562581791285248 2016-06-05 21:00:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @davidfrum It's easy....he's selling his soul, just like a LARGE number of other Republicans, and proving he values party over country
739529284964864004 2016-06-05 18:48:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @themeredith Wow.....he deserves the social media roasting that is to come.

738944109981798403 2016-06-03 04:02:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @StacyLynn624 @WWMcClyde The right thing to do is let the kids go who asked for their release. A 30-day waiting period won't change that.

738833801078411265 2016-06-03 20:44:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> Absolutely unacceptable, people. I find @realDonaldTrump to be an abhorrent person, but that doesn't excuse this.https://twitter.com/LogCabinGOP/status/738811229377056773

738822454710140928 2016-06-03 19:59:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NormOrnstein @sherrodharris Not defending either one, because I can't stand them, but there was about a 3-year time gap between events.

737823538338369536 2016-05-31 01:50:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LonghornBlitz Hehehehe
737823188155916291 2016-05-31 01:48:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @LonghornBlitz Pssst.....it's Beau. ;-)
737814901595377665 2016-05-31 01:15:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball JD needs to get Banny some other RP options. Right now, he's limited.
737810196798443520 2016-05-31 00:57:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway I'm just saying he doesn't have many effective options right now.

737807650503593984 2016-05-31 00:47:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris As T.O. once said.... "Get your popcorn ready....'cause it's gonna be a show!"
737806896980054016 2016-05-31 00:44:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway I understand that, but since Ramos went 3 yesterday, you'd be cool with throwing Tolleson or Jackson out there? I wouldn't.
737805090199764992 2016-05-31 00:36:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @onestrikeaway What RP would you recommend he use right now? Claudio? It's not like he has a lot of options in the "effective" category.

737507567933349892 2016-05-30 04:54:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump Back that claim up with evidence, sir....if you can....otherwise, it's just another piece of BS spewing from your piehole.
737506851386884096 2016-05-30 04:51:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs My thought is he signs a 1-yr deal with OKC. He and Westbrook then become FAs together.
737505696900481025 2016-05-30 04:47:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @SeanTPendergast I think KD signs a 1-year deal with OKC,  so he and Westbrook can be FAs together.

737375916146360320 2016-05-30 20:11:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch They're going to wait until after the season to clean house, IMO.
737344345859194880 2016-05-30 18:06:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Ask @KevinDunn01.  He said as much on-air last week. He said Augie knew it was ending, but wanted to finish out his contract
737342239714598912 2016-05-30 17:57:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Augie was going to retire after his contract ended next year, regardless.

735884432628846592 2016-05-26 17:24:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @ahammsportsgeek As long as they're all gone after this season when they hire a new HC, I could live with that.
735883535102287874 2016-05-26 17:21:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @KEYESportsBob I can understand not firing the whole staff, considering the calendar, as long as it happens after the season.
735878712600580097 2016-05-26 17:02:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> .@AlexDunlapNFL deserves a lot of credit for getting on this story early and pushing it despite threats levied against him and others.
735878190762053633 2016-05-26 17:00:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> @schadjoe Oh....so that makes it okay for him to stay in as Chancellor then? Puh-lease....
735876890787880960 2016-05-26 16:54:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> Keep speaking out. You were wronged and the @Baylor BOR still doesn't get it if they're not firing Starr & McCaw. Stay strong.

735873462275735552 2016-05-26 16:41:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> Attention @Baylor BOR....moving #KenStarr to another position and putting #IanMcCaw on probation simply won't cut it. #YouStillDontGetIt

735868017301557250 2016-05-26 16:19:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> Oh, and @Baylor....yes, you do have to fire #KenStarr to get credit for doing the right thing. Just sayin'....
735867764825427968 2016-05-26 16:18:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @kg_veteran Legal representation to work out contract details and a PR firm to repair his image. Pretty reasonable.
735867414051594240 2016-05-26 16:17:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> It took @Baylor longer than it should have, but firing #KenStarr and #ArtBriles was the right thing to do to begin the process of healing.
735866962387963904 2016-05-26 16:15:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @coopmavs @kg_veteran He's hired legal representation and a PR firm. He will be gone if he's not already

735316079497621505 2016-05-24 03:46:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @PaulPabst Pull a "Baltimore Colts"....pack up the trucks in the middle of the night and bolt.
735313087641858048 2016-05-24 03:34:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> Solid take....
735311640766369793 2016-05-24 03:28:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr They didn't blow them out. They won by 2 or 3.
735310714097795072 2016-05-24 03:25:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BillSimmons What about the alternative that OKC is just defending well and out-playing them?
735309512123535361 2016-05-24 03:20:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong So does 'rapist'. See what I did there?

735215069429043200 2016-05-24 21:05:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 Oh, I have no doubt. I have a couple of off-air Barnes experiences myself.
735213004963254272 2016-05-24 20:56:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KevinDunn01 That is a quintessential Barnes story....

735198204002607105 2016-05-24 19:58:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @JasonHGTruitt It's not really true....
735197359852785665 2016-05-24 19:54:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken @UT_vs_Aggie Patterson was incompetent, but the rest of this tweet is laughable.
735196152165847040 2016-05-24 19:49:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin @DanWolken Especially considering Gilbert worked for Briles at Houston a decade ago....
735195497846079488 2016-05-24 19:47:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin @DanWolken the percentage of that partiality is pretty low
735195158841430017 2016-05-24 19:45:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken @EricNahlin this seems pretty obvious at this point....

735164190420144132 2016-05-24 17:42:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> As far as @Baylor and #KenStarr goes...like Lt. Harris said in "Police Academy".....One down, several to go. #BaylorScandal

735162139975917568 2016-05-24 17:34:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken Yes, it's so nauseating that people are calling out men who harbored rapists. How dare they?? #sarcasm Again....be better.
735161641185091588 2016-05-24 17:32:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DanWolken Ah, yes....the tired guilt by association argument. Be better, dude....

734850310905040896 2016-05-23 20:55:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @SandlerJ I tweeted that before seeing the update on Stubbs.

733509249746141184 2016-05-19 04:06:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @_joelbryant_ @BilltotheBob @nlgraham1 No
733481919480913924 2016-05-19 02:18:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @_joelbryant_ @BilltotheBob I think so because of the subject matter in this case
733481029428613121 2016-05-19 02:14:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> @_joelbryant_ @BilltotheBob I never said it was invalid. I said that on this topic, I thought the sample-size should have been bigger
733480421938237442 2016-05-19 02:12:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @_joelbryant_ @BilltotheBob Inferential Statistics provide you with models (guidelines). The size of sample is still a choice
733479903866159105 2016-05-19 02:10:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Sikorkasaurus @_joelbryant_ @BilltotheBob IMO, when trying to assign an opinion to an entire race, you should have a minimum 4-digit sample
733479058927800321 2016-05-19 02:06:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Sikorkasaurus @_joelbryant_ @BilltotheBob It's MY opinion that the sample-size was too small. You disagree. Fine. It was still their choice
733475988965728257 2016-05-19 01:54:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Sikorkasaurus @_joelbryant_ @BilltotheBob I know exactly what that term means, but thanks anyway. Their sample-size was still too small IMO
733456634014359552 2016-05-19 00:37:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @wacotrib The AG is a Baylor grad. Just sayin'....

733455576022163457 2016-05-19 00:33:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @ClayTravis @Sikorkasaurus Ah, the standard name-calling defense. If you think 500 is a big enough sample-size, fine. I don't.
733454597872717826 2016-05-19 00:29:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bomani_jones @ClayTravis @Sikorkasaurus They polled 500 people. I'd hardly call that representative of Native Americans feelings nationwide

733451993482584064 2016-05-19 00:19:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ClayTravis @bomani_jones Just because ALL Native-Americans aren't offended by it, doesn't mean NONE are offended. I know many who are.
733451364907393024 2016-05-19 00:16:46 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @txfins You get one more chance....back up your charge with a specific example.
733450720742014976 2016-05-19 00:14:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong @Baylor I'm pretty sure I do....
733450243535032321 2016-05-19 00:12:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Baylor @ChuckFnStrong What does it stand for, Coach?
733449394175901697 2016-05-19 00:08:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @txfins You accused UT of looking the other way and covering up rape. Back up your claim or shut up.
733448082860302336 2016-05-19 00:03:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MBHORNSFAN @txfins That has NOTHING to do with the accusation you made. You obviously can't back up your charge, so you have no credibility

733445565053173760 2016-05-19 23:53:44 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markmoore9517 And that happened under Mack, not Charlie
733444590976438272 2016-05-19 23:49:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @markmoore9517 I was replying to the other guy, my apologies.

731985032437338116 2016-05-15 23:10:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde After seeing the replay of the punch, Busby said "Roogie is now 2 for 5 today"

731983701802766336 2016-05-15 23:04:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball To be fair, the defense let him down. Inning should have been over
731982229706956800 2016-05-15 22:58:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Did you catch the line from Busby after they showed the slo-mo video of the punch?

730499197124759552 2016-05-11 20:45:55 UTC <kipsbigboy> @lonestarball He's a former Florida congressman....Progressive Democrat.
730463408919732225 2016-05-11 18:23:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BenRogers I think he was out because the tag was on his back leg as he lost contact with the bag for a half second on the slide.

727687497862422528 2016-05-03 02:33:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @justinwells2424 Dallas is losing because of too many stupid penalties, and their special teams have completely failed them in this series.

727676372731068416 2016-05-03 01:49:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd The latter is the more likely, IMO.

727349771397029888 2016-05-02 04:11:13 UTC <kipsbigboy> @KEYESportsBob Yup....right after Ginobli stepped over the sideline, so they missed one both ways.

725879226721689600 2016-04-28 02:47:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal @DreMcDonald The Ted Ginn comparison is perfect....without the returner ability.
725878178363793408 2016-04-28 02:43:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean The comparison was also hands (or lack thereof) based.
725877879863537664 2016-04-28 02:42:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean Fuller will stop himself with drops. When you get compared to Ted Ginn, that's not a positive thing.
725869125168295939 2016-04-28 02:07:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Boys_Vox @gibbshenderson @eliasmcmillan I don't mean tomorrow, lol. I'm speculating a possibility a couple of years down the line.
725866489987780608 2016-04-28 01:57:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I'm with you. I see him as a corner who can play safety if you need it.
725866298408759296 2016-04-28 01:56:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gibbshenderson @Boys_Vox @eliasmcmillan You're probably looking at Jones and Wilcox as your two safeties in the near future.
725866045022466048 2016-04-28 01:55:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I wouldn't take either. I would've done everything I could to trade down.
725865719800299520 2016-04-28 01:54:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Yeah, but not at #4. Look, I don't agree with that assessment, but if that's what they thought, then I understand.
725865113626923008 2016-04-28 01:51:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Brad Sham just told me the Cowboys saw Ramsey more as a safety, not a corner. That's why they took Elliot instead.
725864604492922880 2016-04-28 01:49:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Agreed....
725864474545000450 2016-04-28 01:49:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gibbshenderson @Boys_Vox @eliasmcmillan Plus....you don't take a safety that high.
725864397705375744 2016-04-28 01:48:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gibbshenderson @Boys_Vox @eliasmcmillan Not necessarily. They drafted Jones last year.
725864261482749953 2016-04-28 01:48:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Or I would at least change all my passwords so no one else can access them

725860057515069440 2016-04-28 01:31:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Boys_Vox @eliasmcmillan I'm more curious about the decision to take Elliot over Ramsey.

725859204712394753 2016-04-28 01:28:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @andyway22 Should have picked Ramsey
725854306394497024 2016-04-28 01:08:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ktfuntweets He's not the best. The best got picked #5 after Dallas passed on him.
725849333556334593 2016-04-28 00:49:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Exactly
725848694457659392 2016-04-28 00:46:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> Elliot is a very good player, but he wasn't the best player available. The best available was Ramsey, PLUS he was a need. Jerry gonna Jerry.
725847214426193921 2016-04-28 00:40:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving Alfred Morris is a 1-year deal with an option. He's short-term.

722250116774514689 2016-04-18 02:27:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> Missed most of the 1st 2 periods, but what I did see was not good from the @DallasStars. Terrible defense and puck possession....
722069428771229696 2016-04-18 14:29:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @fbrumormill @sportingnews *Yawn*....nothing but clickbait. Nothing new on this story....

721526667798155264 2016-04-16 02:32:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> GOOOOOOOAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!! 2-0 DALLAS!!! @DallasStars @jamiebenn14 #StanleyCupPlayoffs
721522499150700544 2016-04-16 02:15:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @chris_hummer Possibly
721522438203248640 2016-04-16 02:15:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chris_hummer Yes they are....it saddens me.
721511078610411520 2016-04-16 01:30:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @DallasStars take a 1-0 lead on maybe the weirdest goal I've ever seen!! #LetsGoStars #StanleyCupPlayoffs
721424491675389952 2016-04-16 19:46:16 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @BDavisAAS They've severely hurt him, actually
721423791818051584 2016-04-16 19:43:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> @max_olson @chrisgb00 And Swoopes had at least five passes dropped, including two deep balls, one of which was counted as a pick.
721422575390171136 2016-04-16 19:38:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean Probably not until the end
721422007418523648 2016-04-16 19:36:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> Both QBs have thrown well today, especially on deep balls. The WRs, though. Have had some hands issues, especially on Swoopes' possessions
721187366531010560 2016-04-15 04:04:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @thatsean For the record, I wouldn't have a problem with burnt orange helmets with a white Longhorn on the side.
721187167058309120 2016-04-15 04:03:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @thatsean If it was actual burnt orange it might look smooth, but that looks OSU-Halloween-esque
720807774641197056 2016-04-14 02:55:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving I had to catch the replay. I'm watching playoff hockey, hehe.
720803910730919936 2016-04-14 02:40:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Young_Dubb22 I get that you want to support your teammates, but do yourself a favor & stop tweeting. You're looking very ignorant & naive.
720801830901387265 2016-04-14 02:32:02 UTC <kipsbigboy> If you're a member of the @UTAustin family, you need to read this. #HarukaWeiserhttps://twitter.com/thedailytexan/status/720665590331875328

720480755059683329 2016-04-13 05:16:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> Congrats to the @warriors on the record. It's a hell of an accomplishment. The '96 @chicagobulls are still better, but hey...great job!!
720439784800329728 2016-04-13 02:33:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DavidSmoak He's actually a freakishly large Ferengi here on this planet to study Donald Trump's "Art of the Deal". Basketball is his Oo-mox
720438838447845376 2016-04-13 02:29:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Lana Baseball rules all, yes? ;)
720436211089735682 2016-04-13 02:19:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> I love my @dallasmavs but they've been an avg team since winning the title. Blowing an 18-pt halftime lead to @spurs B-team is unacceptable.
720433971566239744 2016-04-13 02:10:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong Coach, you should just go ahead and buzz the rest of those eyebrows off....it's a better look than the stripes.
720406882771275777 2016-04-13 00:22:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @crlcourt @ClayTravis And it happens in the right as well....
720397499941277697 2016-04-13 23:45:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @crlcourt @ClayTravis It's more than simply alleged. Don't forget that protesting is free speech also. Regardless, it's happening both ways.
720395414826983426 2016-04-13 23:37:05 UTC <kipsbigboy> @crlcourt @ClayTravis Since you apparently haven't seen this....they've done so to protesters at Trump rallies multiple times.
720393855875424256 2016-04-13 23:30:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> @crlcourt @ClayTravis (2/2)...are treated with disdain & visceral reaction instead of debate and discussion, as if you aren't entitled to it
720393339749539840 2016-04-13 23:28:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @crlcourt @ClayTravis It's about mindset. The hardcore left & right have moved so far in those directions that opposing opinions.... (1/2)
720392647685242881 2016-04-13 23:26:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @crlcourt @ClayTravis The behavior at Trump rallies are an example.
720388456216571908 2016-04-13 23:09:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I missed your statement about it....how was GnR?
720388202800885760 2016-04-13 23:08:26 UTC <kipsbigboy> @malavemark @ClayTravis And your evidence of that is what?
720388043874537476 2016-04-13 23:07:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @crlcourt @ClayTravis Just as an example, have you seen Trump rallies? It's the same mindset.
720382657503240192 2016-04-13 22:46:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ClayTravis While I agree with the sentiment in your piece, don't act like it's just liberals who have the mindset you pointed out.

720356734095593474 2016-04-13 21:03:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He was on my fantasy team the last two years, so you can imagine where my expectations are.

710222866856316928 2016-03-16 21:55:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Ian_A_Boyd Kasich was dumb for backing out of the Fox News debate after Trump did. It would have been a perfect opportunity for him.

708690957231755265 2016-03-12 16:27:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump Shut down your 1st ammendment right? They were exercising theirs, sir. No one prevented you from speaking. You chose not to
708689467838570496 2016-03-12 16:21:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sn_ncaaf @McClain_on_NFL He won't miss a game.
708536565425778688 2016-03-11 06:14:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @billmaher I believe it could potentially be a very good episode, especially since I think you & your staff would pick the right panel
708535662622826496 2016-03-11 06:10:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @billmaher (2/2) Of course, you could vett them & test their knowledge of current events, then pick a panel with a wide spectrum of ideology
708534530613743616 2016-03-11 06:06:10 UTC <kipsbigboy> @billmaher Have you ever considered having an "Average Joe" episode of 'Real Time'? You could have people submit applications online (1/2)

708461803789901824 2016-03-11 01:17:11 UTC <kipsbigboy> With the behavior we've already seen at #TrumpRallies before tonight, is anyone REALLY all that surprised that this is happening in Chicago?
708460300647858177 2016-03-11 01:11:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @oreilIyfactor LOL - Yeah.....that's what happened. You are such a joke.

707753153043673088 2016-03-09 02:21:15 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy I want Zay as healthy as possible next week w/Cam as a contributor. It's unrealistic to expect him now, to be what he was.
707751576610299904 2016-03-09 02:14:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy We agree. I just hope almost a full week off has helped Zay's foot.
707751230949298176 2016-03-09 02:13:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy At the time of his injury, everyone was finding ways to get it to him. He was demanding it.
707750425391333376 2016-03-09 02:10:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy Close for me because Cam was dominating so much that it was opening up things for everyone, including Zay
707749817041047553 2016-03-09 02:08:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde And hopefully you beat Baylor, so he can get a few minutes on Friday too.
707749547942891520 2016-03-09 02:06:56 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy The latter, but it's a close choice.
707736929140256768 2016-03-09 01:16:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bandlersbanter @WillMcAvoyACN Justifiable to who? You? Mrs. Obama is attending on Friday because that is the tradition & history for this.
707735827669852160 2016-03-09 01:12:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @bandlersbanter @WillMcAvoyACN @chrislhayes So even though there's no history or tradition of a President attending these things, he should?

707665022743240704 2016-03-09 20:31:03 UTC <kipsbigboy> @EricNahlin @bkaucher 4 Houston Lamar Miller is a very good signing. Osweiler on the other hand? Well, $16M/yr is a high price for "maybe"

704871201428996096 2016-03-01 03:29:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mrBobbyBones He looks like a dog begging for scraps at the dinner table, hoping Trump will pick him as his VP....
704870872104853505 2016-03-01 03:28:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo He is a certified loon....
704870666139373568 2016-03-01 03:27:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SheaInIrving No bet....
704870483666161665 2016-03-01 03:26:33 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheDailyShow It's more like "PLEASE pick me as your VP. PLEASE pick me as your VP. PLEASE pick me as your VP!!!"
704868672129466368 2016-03-01 03:19:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> Watching @GovChristie stand behind @realDonaldTrump, staring at him like a dog begging for scraps at the dinner table, is utterly comical.
704867751072956418 2016-03-01 03:15:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy About as much his home state as NY was to Hillary.... and yes, Cruz makes me ill.
704775817528786946 2016-03-01 21:10:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> Spectacular....https://twitter.com/ChuckFnStrong/status/704701194552250368
704506726171607040 2016-02-29 03:21:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> Kansas is shooting lights out plus they have three extra teammates on the court in black & white strips. Impossible to win against that.
704502837535907840 2016-02-29 03:05:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @druceleroy @Bitterwhiteguy I haven't seen a team get away with this much at-the-rim contact all season.
704502770661863424 2016-02-29 03:05:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @druceleroy @Bitterwhiteguy They aren't why we're losing, but they are why we aren't within striking distance
704501195205808128 2016-02-29 02:59:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Bitterwhiteguy @druceleroy With the help of the refs....
704496367687720960 2016-02-29 02:39:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CedGolden Hard to do that when the refs literally are calling nothing when you get hit driving to the rim.
704495549689393153 2016-02-29 02:36:42 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckCarltonDMN Texas played terrible against Baylor. The refs are letting Kansas get away with EVERYTHING in this one.
704495308193923072 2016-02-29 02:35:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> Kansas could punch a guy on a drive the basket and these refs wouldn't call.it
704494238369603584 2016-02-29 02:31:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> If Texas was actually getting the calls they deserve at the rim, they might be in this game
704493132973408256 2016-02-29 02:27:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> Video screen just showed @ColtMcCoy @tonyromo and @JasonWitten her at The Drum!!
704489993385840640 2016-02-29 02:14:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> Texas has been fouled 3 times FOR SURE on shots near the rim....no calls. @Big12Conference #RefsSuck
704488067202043904 2016-02-29 02:06:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TexasEx10 sec 44....HOLLA!! #HookEm

704486287625969664 2016-02-29 01:59:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> Biggest thing I've noticed tonight... @cam_ctmd55 wasn't wearing a boot during Senior Night activities. @Bitterwhiteguy @DMcComasOB
704455319221510144 2016-02-29 23:56:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> It's already PACKED inside @ScholzGartenATX....LOTS of @KUAthletics fans. @TexasMBB need to get here!! #HookEm #TexvsKU
704386007324454912 2016-02-29 19:21:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Evan_P_Grant ....of crap
704325717736103936 2016-02-29 15:21:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Always a good start to the week....
704178818857062400 2016-02-28 05:38:08 UTC <kipsbigboy> @realDonaldTrump Lies flow out of the mouth of @realdonaldtrump like curse words flow out of the mouth of someone with Turrets
704177933858934784 2016-02-28 05:34:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> I've said it before and I'll say it again.... If you support @realDonaldTrump for President.... You. Are. A. Fool.
704169805985648641 2016-02-28 05:02:19 UTC <kipsbigboy> I saw 6 of the 8 nominees.... Spotlight was the Best Picture. I'm so glad it won!! #Oscars
704166356925575168 2016-02-28 04:48:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @SedanoESPN You are correct, sir....
704156255900688384 2016-02-28 04:08:28 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Just saying he got robbed that year, so I wanted him to get an Oscar for Iconic character he created.
704155766899347456 2016-02-28 04:06:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal True, but Rocky Balboa is an iconic character, and if Peter Finch hadn't died Stallone would've won Best Actor for "Rocky"
704155031151333376 2016-02-28 04:03:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal Obviously, Stallone winning would have been more of a career achievement award, but still....they've done that before.
704154771104501760 2016-02-28 04:02:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> @AJIsTheReal I forgot to mention Christian Bale. Basically, the whole rest of the category was better than the winner.
704152989863247872 2016-02-28 03:55:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @kbohls It was funny, but he still shouldn't have won the Oscar
704151710827048960 2016-02-28 03:50:25 UTC <kipsbigboy> I can't believe Bridge of Spies guy won Best Supporting Actor. Stallone should have won but he, Ruffalo, & Hardy were ALL better!! #Oscars
704135169318334464 2016-02-28 02:44:41 UTC <kipsbigboy> Would someone please tell @TheAcademy that their "Thank you scroll" is very annoying and distracting?? #Oscars
703723122592059392 2016-02-27 23:27:21 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RadioLunchbox And how is that different from most days? ;-)

703683416617668608 2016-02-27 20:49:34 UTC <kipsbigboy> The non-calls on drives to the rim by @TexasMBB have been staggering....

702380082879451137 2016-02-23 06:30:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> Every time I think about the fact that @tedcruz "represents" me in the US Senate, I literally get nauseous.

701134755551531008 2016-02-20 20:02:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MarkRosner3 @DMcComasOB There was no foul. It was one of many God-awful calls.
701134475116179456 2016-02-20 20:00:59 UTC <kipsbigboy> Possibly the biggest crowd of the year at The Drum, and Texas plays possibly its worst half of basketball of the year.

697972242450219008 2016-02-11 02:35:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde Agreed....
697971855353774080 2016-02-11 02:33:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde According to many people from various walks of life, she does that fine in smaller, private settings. Just not in big public ones
697277864031309825 2016-02-09 04:36:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @calvinwatkins @mattmosley I love the Mavs, but they are an average basketball team.

697266870005604352 2016-02-09 03:52:31 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChristineHookEm Interesting choice.....celibacy or a no-work-needed slim figure.
697264982157754370 2016-02-09 03:45:00 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChristineHookEm I mean, there's always girls, right? :P
697264432422875136 2016-02-09 03:42:49 UTC <kipsbigboy> There are a lot of people in New Hampshire tonight (and to a lesser extent....Iowa last week), who are making me shake my head tonight.

696911029603729409 2016-02-08 04:18:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> @clarencehilljr @LoJoe12 I believe the correct answer is 'what'
696910309596884992 2016-02-08 04:15:40 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean Texas wasn't getting the same hand-check fouls that OU was getting. That's what led to the FT differential.
696909566605291520 2016-02-08 04:12:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mikefinger @DoubleJLonghorn The goaltend was legit. The shot was on the way down.
696908814558203904 2016-02-08 04:09:43 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CoreyElliot Nothing except the refs....

696907951743762432 2016-02-08 04:06:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @NateHeupel @BarkingCarnival @jonbkennedy That call on Taylor was the weakest push-off call ever
696907592983924737 2016-02-08 04:04:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> OU won because they got home-game officiating tonight. The stats bear that out.
696903033242800128 2016-02-08 03:46:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @gkketch OU has been given so many cheap hand-check fouls. Texas? Not so much....

696590528461217792 2016-02-07 07:04:58 UTC <kipsbigboy> Nice attempt at a news dump here by Ken Starr, dropping this 2 hours before #SB50 kickoff, hoping it will get buriedhttps://twitter.com/Baylor/status/696445983832412162
696553798496444416 2016-02-07 04:39:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @sherrodharris @craigfloyd Fans, the media, the league would like their MVP and face of a franchise do it. Like it or not, that's how it is.
696553109636558848 2016-02-07 04:36:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd @sherrodharris It wasn't a good look at all.
696552935547752448 2016-02-07 04:35:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @craigfloyd @sherrodharris He's giving more ammo to his haters for no reason other than he hasn't learned how to lose with grace.
696548483231133696 2016-02-07 04:17:54 UTC <kipsbigboy> Wow @CameronNewton I guess you haven't grown up quite as much as we thought you had. That isn't how an MVP acts after a loss. #LoseWithClass
696534958047821825 2016-02-07 03:24:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> I am extremely happy for @DeMarcusWare #PeytonManning and #WadePhillips. Well-deserved. #SB50
696531473755561986 2016-02-07 03:10:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @TheLatinSnake_ @danrafaelespn So I guess you hate defense. Well, I've seen you fight, so that makes sense.
696531255953784832 2016-02-07 03:09:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @MBHORNSFAN No.....he should wait.
696530262541205504 2016-02-07 03:05:30 UTC <kipsbigboy> Unless you're a fan of defense. The defenses have been SPECTACULAR #SB50https://twitter.com/daldridgetnt/status/696529819337650176

696522558032576512 2016-02-07 02:34:53 UTC <kipsbigboy> So let me get this straight...the @NFL is running commercials basically saying "If your team wins the Super Bowl, SHAG LIKE RABBITS!!" #SB50
696518620969472000 2016-02-07 02:19:14 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @Panthers WRs are doing their best @Broncos impersonation tonight. #SB50

694740544216379392 2016-02-02 04:33:48 UTC <kipsbigboy> @MJohnsonEsq @DougCofer @RoyWchees To be clear, I think I'm the alleged troll here.
694740371402690560 2016-02-02 04:33:06 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoyWchees @DougCofer @MJohnsonEsq You keep saying that word. I do not think it means what you think it means....
694739052264759296 2016-02-02 04:27:52 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DougCofer @RoyWchees @MJohnsonEsq Unlike at Baylor where both players were allowed to stay on the team and campus.
694738955342737408 2016-02-02 04:27:29 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DougCofer @RoyWchees @MJohnsonEsq Big difference between the two situations...as soon as they were accused, they were kicked off the team
694738024710610945 2016-02-02 04:23:47 UTC <kipsbigboy> @DougCofer @RoyWchees @MJohnsonEsq More deflection, no demands for accountability...

694730688390496257 2016-02-02 03:54:38 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoyWchees @DougCofer @MJohnsonEsq Um....there are currently two former players in prison for rape. What more do you need?

694728851453140992 2016-02-02 03:47:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoyWchees @DougCofer @MJohnsonEsq Instead of blaming the Ath Dept & Admin for allowing rapists to stay on campus to commit more rapes.
694728380126666756 2016-02-02 03:45:27 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoyWchees @DougCofer @MJohnsonEsq Yes....let's blame ESPN and Texas Monthly for actually bringing this to light (unlike the local media)

694356160103604225 2016-02-01 03:06:23 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @dick_nixon more than resembles....his is frightening similar in look, attitude, and extremist tendencies.
694274211167096832 2016-02-01 21:40:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> .@CoachArtBriles You are correct Art, that #TruthDontLie. How about you address some truth regarding sexual assaults involving your players?
694269405073510400 2016-02-01 21:21:39 UTC <kipsbigboy> If I was a fan/alumnus of @Baylor I would be DEMANDING a house-cleaning of the admin & ath dept, and the local Waco media should be ASHAMED
694255951927496711 2016-02-01 20:28:12 UTC <kipsbigboy> @jaymohr37 I know it's SB week, but are you going to address the Baylor sexual assault scandal? #JayMohrSports
694052349724086272 2016-01-31 06:59:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @BarkingCarnival That is awesomely funny
694036289201410048 2016-01-31 05:55:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChristineHookEm @ChuckFnStrong Quandre trollin'.....
693838250448805894 2016-01-31 16:48:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RealLilyThai3 Hit me up next time you're back in the ATX :-)
693828338775777280 2016-01-31 16:09:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> Just, wow....https://twitter.com/espn/status/693821069879160832

693637835350368258 2016-01-30 03:32:01 UTC <kipsbigboy> @CBS11BillJones @1053thefan I think the Big 12 wins those matchups 6-4, or 7-3. We saw one of them this year. Tech beat Arkansas.
693635604458790916 2016-01-30 03:23:09 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @JeffEisenberg His tweet is fair despite his pumping of the SEC. Big 12 is better top-to-bottom. SEC has a few good teams up top.
693634714054184960 2016-01-30 03:19:37 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @JeffEisenberg His statement seems pretty fair to me.
693631614790701056 2016-01-30 03:07:18 UTC <kipsbigboy> @richeisen EXCELLENT film....best I've seen this past year. My vote for Best Picture, so far....
693627078537715712 2016-01-30 02:49:17 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ChuckFnStrong I see you're now following your daughter on here. Is that so you can better keep up with her? Make sure she's actin' right?
693624844168990721 2016-01-30 02:40:24 UTC <kipsbigboy> @mattmosley @SportsDayDFW Articles like this, that are written before NSD, make me laugh and shake my head.
693624331109175296 2016-01-30 02:38:22 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @CharlesRobinson Good. All he was doing was trolling.
693623569146728451 2016-01-30 02:35:20 UTC <kipsbigboy> @chrisgb00 @CharlesRobinson Why keep arguing with this guy, Chris? His comparison is loose, at best, but he's convinced himself otherwise.
693620928350031872 2016-01-30 02:24:50 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde because as we know, the final score is ALWAYS indicative of how the games actually went.....

693582850109517824 2016-01-30 23:53:32 UTC <kipsbigboy> This #LSUvsOU game is nuts!! #BuddyHeild is cold-blooded!!
693557697019392000 2016-01-30 22:13:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo @dfwticket "Jerry, can I have a hot dog while we watch the Senior Bowl?" "Dammit Wade! Eat whatever the hell you want! I don't care!"
693555683833196544 2016-01-30 22:05:35 UTC <kipsbigboy> @RoFlo @dfwticket Fake Wade/Fake Jerry bits were the best
693471218431733760 2016-01-30 16:29:57 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde He does seem like the sane one on the stage when he gets a chance to actually speak.

692916980236558337 2016-01-28 03:47:36 UTC <kipsbigboy> @ClayTravis @megynkelly She had the "Don't f*ck with me" working tonight, that's for sure....

692523953022201856 2016-01-27 01:45:51 UTC <kipsbigboy> @Sam_Vecenie And the PBP guy needs to be talked to also.....he just said "Arkansas Razorblacks"
692510841976033280 2016-01-27 00:53:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @thatsean That's my question. Why does anyone give a sh*t? It's two rappers and a stripper having a public verbal slap-fight. #MoveAlong

691406818069774337 2016-01-24 23:46:45 UTC <kipsbigboy> @WWMcClyde @billyliucci Is A&M going to try and claim this AFC Championship and put in up in Kyle Field?
691405149156212736 2016-01-24 23:40:07 UTC <kipsbigboy> The @Broncos D was dominant until their safeties went down, but that pass rush....DAMN!! Give #TomBrady MAJOR credit for that 4th Q, though.
