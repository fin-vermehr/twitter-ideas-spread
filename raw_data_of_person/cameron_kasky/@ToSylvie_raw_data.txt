952535753820696578 2018-01-14 13:39:55 UTC <ToSylvie> @BBCWorld I hate landing, a few weeks ago we went on a trip, there was a nervous 7 or 8 year old boy clutching his dad's arm, the dad said " don't worry landing is the safest part of flying " Not sure if he was just trying to comfort his son or if he was serious! Thinking to myself "uh no"
