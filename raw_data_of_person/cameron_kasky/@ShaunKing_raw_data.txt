972287690052898816 2018-03-09 01:47:04 UTC <ShaunKing> I really like this idea.   Democrats should absolutely get rid of the superdelegate system altogether.https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/democrats-are-weighing-a-proposal-to-eliminate?utm_term=.agyJwKNw5E#.ic5Y9Bk9Lq
972284034729603073 2018-03-09 01:32:32 UTC <ShaunKing> When the Dolphins team owner Stephen Ross cited Donald Trump for his influencing his decision making, he provided even more evidence for Colin Kaepernick's grievance with the @NFL.https://sports.yahoo.com/dolphins-owner-stephen-ross-brought-president-trump-problematic-nfl-colin-kaepernicks-grievance-180024969.html

972258181316599809 2018-03-09 23:49:48 UTC <ShaunKing> My thing is this.   We invalidate very important critiques of the role and function of privilege in the music industry - which is actually a complex mess - by saying in that same critique that Bruno is talentless garbage.   That much is a lie. Period.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/972140458242605056
972257414522294275 2018-03-09 23:46:45 UTC <ShaunKing> 2 of my @Morehouse brothers are in the band w/ Bruno.  They are 2 of the most talented musicians in the world.   They work day & night w/ Bruno, in the studio and all over the world - on the music, on arrangements, on shows.  Trust me. Bruno's talented.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/972140458242605056

972245934926172160 2018-03-09 23:01:08 UTC <ShaunKing> @firefire100 Haha. Right. Just saying who are people saying Bruno needs to sound like?
972207467726688257 2018-03-09 20:28:17 UTC <ShaunKing> This is a start. It is better than nothing.   It's not great. It has problems. But it's something.https://twitter.com/teamtrace/status/972206289009995779

972141513072414720 2018-03-09 16:06:12 UTC <ShaunKing> Or is the beef not with Bruno Mars, but with society, and who gets promoted and who doesn't in this country?  That's a serious conversation that we must always have.  But what exactly has Bruno done wrong? What should his music sound like that is culturally acceptable to critics?https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/972140458242605056
972140458242605056 2018-03-09 16:02:01 UTC <ShaunKing> I just want to be practical here.   Are people saying that Bruno Mars shouldn't sing? Or that when he sings he needs to somehow whiten that shit up and sound more like Rod Stewart.   I'm dead serious.   What type of music is this man "allowed" to do?

971834309672931328 2018-03-08 19:45:29 UTC <ShaunKing> I will never be OK with what the @NFL has done to Colin Kaepernick.   The decision to effectively ban him from the NFL is rooted in white supremacy.   It has nothing to do with football. Virtually every expert finally came around to agree with this by the end of the season.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/971834029774434304
971834029774434304 2018-03-08 19:44:23 UTC <ShaunKing> I saw a list today of the top 200 free agents in the @NFL.   Colin Kaepernick wasn't even on the list.   I saw HORRIBLE QBs on that list.  I saw old me who should've retired last year on that list.  I saw QBs who've hardly ever played on that list.   It's outrageous.

971247038162788352 2018-03-06 04:51:53 UTC <ShaunKing> We still do not have the final results in the Dallas DA's primary. Nearly 400 precincts have not yet reported. Slow moving.   So far, Judge Frizell is winning the votes from today by over 1,500 votes, but lost early voting by nearly 5,000 votes.   It's not over, though.

971174506848051202 2018-03-06 00:03:40 UTC <ShaunKing> Utterly disgraceful. Evil.   1. This man is also a murderer. He murdered #HenryGreen. My heart breaks for Henry's family and for the community.   2. He was filmed stomping on a young man's head. The man was handcuffed and laying on the ground.   AND HE JUST GOT HIS JOB BACK.https://twitter.com/DispatchAlerts/status/970691162821529601

971090152914333696 2018-03-06 18:28:29 UTC <ShaunKing> Absolutely!  It's amazing how often we find that the same gun laws used to protect white people from jail are then abandoned, along with the NRA, when Black folk need to call on them.

971087769085898754 2018-03-06 18:19:00 UTC <ShaunKing> @TorreySmithWR My guess is that if young people could vote, they would vote to age the restrictions on those other things.

971081353763676160 2018-03-06 17:53:31 UTC <ShaunKing> @TorreySmithWR How many of those do we have Torrey? Estimates are less than 100 while we have tens of millions of teenagers. It's rare.   Tens of thousands of people over 18 die of drug overdoses and gunshot wounds.
971078477028962304 2018-03-06 17:42:05 UTC <ShaunKing> In Brazil you can vote at 16. In Scotland you can vote at 16.  In Austria you can vote at 16.  In Switzerland you can vote at 16.

971076428006641665 2018-03-06 17:33:56 UTC <ShaunKing> @TorreySmithWR Are you aware of how many countries around the world allow people to vote at 16?   In Brazil you can vote at 16. In Scotland you can vote at 16.  In Austria you can vote at 16.  In Switzerland you can vote at 16.
971075330067791872 2018-03-06 17:29:35 UTC <ShaunKing> @TorreySmithWR Man I've been at lunch tables all over the country.   Again, with your theory that age breeds wisdom or makes people better informed - how do you explain the election of Donald Trump?
971071262247342080 2018-03-06 17:13:25 UTC <ShaunKing> @TorreySmithWR What's the harm in young people voting? And I don't put smoking and buying guns on the same level as voting. Not at all.
971061518119862276 2018-03-06 16:34:42 UTC <ShaunKing> Listen to me!  This is why we must fight to put in new reform-focused DA's nationwide.https://twitter.com/FairPunishment/status/971060438493310976

They are among the most informed people in our country right now.   Your sample size is too small.   I've engaged them all over the country.

970867622463012864 2018-03-05 03:44:13 UTC <ShaunKing> Hate is taught. It is passed down from father to child.   But once you grow up it is your job to educate yourself on the social issues of today, to form your own opinion based on what you know to be true and good.   On what is right.   -Kendi King  #DividedStates
970865184209297408 2018-03-05 03:34:32 UTC <ShaunKing> I've said it before & I will say it again, I'm thankful for all of the #Antifa counter protestors standing against bigotry from coast to coast.  You don't get the love you deserve.  I appreciate you. It's ridiculous that it's politically incorrect for us say this.  #DividedStates
970864869875638272 2018-03-05 03:33:17 UTC <ShaunKing> Terrorist: a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.  Terrorist is not a word exclusive to muslim extremists, but the media doesn't seem to know that since violent white men are simply "disturbed citizens".  -Kendi.  #DividedStates

970863881181650944 2018-03-05 03:29:21 UTC <ShaunKing> Oregon was the first and only state in American history founded with the principle that African Americans were not allowed to live there - and would be whipped w/ 39 lashes if found within the state.   Facts.   #DividedStates

970862315535990784 2018-03-05 03:23:08 UTC <ShaunKing> The day before Jeremy Christian murdered two wonderful men, he brutally assaulted a Black woman on the train, Demetria Hester.  The police did not take it seriously.   This is stain on the Portland Police Department and on our country.   #DividedStates
970861651837837313 2018-03-05 03:20:30 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear Portland,  You know I love you. I do. So much.  But you must confront the deep white supremacy embedded there. It is a cancer to the progress you desire. You are not as progressive as you claim to be until you confront this head on.   CC: @tedwheeler #DividedStates

970860599021395970 2018-03-05 03:16:19 UTC <ShaunKing> Absolutely.   And we aren't asking police to murder these white supremacists.   We are asking that police treat our unarmed non-violent boys, girls, men, and women with the respect they give MURDEROUS white supremacists.https://twitter.com/MrDavidJohns/status/970859473358196741

970856339407818753 2018-03-05 02:59:23 UTC <ShaunKing> Every time slavery or segregation is brought up in school, me and my black friends are expected to be the experts. It's a strange uncomfortable feeling that is never addressed in the classroom, for everyone to have me in mind when thinking of slaves.  -Kendi King  #DividedStates
970855531601694720 2018-03-05 02:56:11 UTC <ShaunKing> Politics and personal relationships are no longer separate. Your political views reflect who you are as a person, and how you believe other people should be treated.   -Kendi King  #DividedStates

970852461241126912 2018-03-05 02:43:58 UTC <ShaunKing> My 15 year old daughter, Kendi, is soon going to be joining me here - live tweeting for #DividedStates on A&E.  She will sign every tweet w/ --Kendi
970852123440279552 2018-03-05 02:42:38 UTC <ShaunKing> I am speaking for myself.  If my children were consistently harassed and ridiculed by bigots, and the school did not protect them, I would remove them from that school  I have recommended this to a few dozen families. 100% of them told me they are glad they did it  #DividedStates
970851158486069249 2018-03-05 02:38:48 UTC <ShaunKing> Before this happened to me, I had a dozen different overt incidents of being called nigger, chased by a truck, forced into fist fights. I had a jar of tobacco spit thrown into my face.   THEN this happened.   #DividedStateshttps://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/970845275232366593
970850381675814912 2018-03-05 02:35:43 UTC <ShaunKing> #DividedStates is now trending nationwide.   Watch along with us now on A&E.   It's powerful, painful, and necessary.
970849606719459333 2018-03-05 02:32:38 UTC <ShaunKing> PARENTS.  If a school administrator tells you that your children experiencing hate speech is protecting by the 1st Amendment, they are wrong.   Hate speech is not protected speech in a K-12 setting. Period.
970849058754613248 2018-03-05 02:30:27 UTC <ShaunKing> So many Black families move to predominantly white towns in search of well-resourced schools.  They find those schools and also find that their students experience overt bigotry on a daily basis.   The tradeoff, in my opinion, is not worth it.   #DividedStates
970848071058894849 2018-03-05 02:26:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Shameful to hear adults tell victims of bigotry to "just ignore it."  THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION.   You must end it. PERIOD.   #DividedStates
970847363211415552 2018-03-05 02:23:43 UTC <ShaunKing> I grew up in a town so similar to the one being profiled on A&E's #DividedStates right now.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/970845275232366593

970846718710439938 2018-03-05 02:21:09 UTC <ShaunKing> Young black boys now telling their testimonies of being called slaves, niggers, and monkeys. Having Confederate flags thrown and draped over them.   #DividedStates

970844252073811968 2018-03-05 02:11:21 UTC <ShaunKing> What we're seeing in this nation right now is overt hate speech and violent threats from white supremacists & Neo-Nazis growing like wildfire.  And they are defending it patriotic "free speech."  #DividedStates
970843610219450368 2018-03-05 02:08:48 UTC <ShaunKing> 30% of students of color report that they have been a direct victim of hate-based bullying.   30%. In 2018.  #DividedStates
970843369529380865 2018-03-05 02:07:51 UTC <ShaunKing> The surge of hate crimes in America's schools, the greatest surge ever on record in American history, is simply a reflection of this nation.   #DividedStates
970843093791662080 2018-03-05 02:06:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Since the presidential election, incidents of hate crimes & bullying in America's schools have DOUBLED.   #DIVIDEDSTATES

970842102019100672 2018-03-05 02:02:49 UTC <ShaunKing> What you are seeing here now is what Black students in white spaces are dealing with all over America in this generation - being called nigger on social media by their white peers.   #DIVIDEDSTATES

970816934727045120 2018-03-05 00:22:48 UTC <ShaunKing> This much is clear.   Donald Trump surrounded himself with a cast of low character criminals.   Here's what's painful for most Americans to admit.   Trump won the election with that crew because low-character criminality resonates deeply with millions of Americans.
970800531605213184 2018-03-05 23:17:37 UTC <ShaunKing> Something's off here w/ Sam Nunberg.   No sane person would advise what he's doing. It seems like a ruse or a bad joke.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/970799933279191040

They are overwhelmingly conservative and have  lost so many seats and so much influence over the past decade.

970317115176751104 2018-03-04 15:16:42 UTC <ShaunKing> . @SenCarmichaelWV   What you are doing right now is deeply shameful. You, not the teachers, are why kids have been out of school of 7 straight days there.  Stop blocking the pay raise for teachers. What they are paid is an American embarrassment.
970316525893713924 2018-03-04 15:14:22 UTC <ShaunKing> You think these teachers are playing politics?  They are fighting for a dignified wage. Your teachers can hardly make a living.   This isnt politics, its about dignity.  Shame on you for paying the teachers of West Virginia so poorly.https://twitter.com/wvgovernor/status/970128818869547008
970315718741938179 2018-03-04 15:11:09 UTC <ShaunKing> Listen, @WVGovernor - you could have your teachers back in the classroom tomorrow, but you are paying them poverty wages. Its embarrassing youve let it get this bad.  Teachers are working fast food jobs to make ends meet.  Give them their pay raise. That will end this.https://twitter.com/wvgovernor/status/970128818869547008

970029393337778176 2018-03-03 20:13:24 UTC <ShaunKing> @liberalidiotz I was a pastor for nearly 15 years.
970029219668463621 2018-03-03 20:12:42 UTC <ShaunKing> @michalcelia Of course Im not the arbiter. But Im also mature enough to understand when good people have misunderstood a phrase that is common for us but not for you. Black people, for hundreds of years, have spoken of our enemies and Jesuss enemies. Nothing to do with hate speech.
970028728448319489 2018-03-03 20:10:45 UTC <ShaunKing> @sohmer Let me help with context. When I feel like Im being attacked, as a Christian I think of Jesus being attacked. And I sometimes think of my enemies as his enemies. Also, to be clear, his enemies were not exclusively Jewish.
970028262616420360 2018-03-03 20:08:54 UTC <ShaunKing> @veegtables No. It wasnt. You took it that way. Thats simply not what it was. Im sorry. I agree that you have interpreted it that way. On the matter of that tweet, respectfully, you are wrong
970027893618302981 2018-03-03 20:07:26 UTC <ShaunKing> @sohmer Heres what I think has happened. You see her support of Farrakhan and have concluded shes anti-Semitic. That then colored how you see everything she says. That phrase is common for us. Its been said for generations. Youve misunderstood it.
970027100173422592 2018-03-03 20:04:17 UTC <ShaunKing> @veegtables Of course you do. You can also be terribly misinformed. The cultural gap here is embarrassing. Its a common phrase for us and it is not anti-Semitic. It just isnt.
970025987076485120 2018-03-03 19:59:52 UTC <ShaunKing> @George_d86 @BenjaminPDixon You know what. We thought hard about it. Our 16 year old is in a great school that we cant leave. But Ive also grown to loathe Georgia. I LOVE Atlanta.
970025456799043584 2018-03-03 19:57:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Again. Ill say it a thousand times.   What Tamika tweeted was not anti-Semitic. It wasnt even about Jewish people in general.   In the Black Church tradition we often compare our enemies to the enemies of Jesus. Ive done it.  It has NOTHING to do with hate speech.   Stop.https://twitter.com/tamikadmallory/status/969707634378108928

969968173146656768 2018-03-03 16:10:08 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.  The City of Baltimore has stepped up and decided to do something I've been hoping to see for years...  Make police pay out of their own pockets for brutality and corruption. Dock their pay. Hit their pensions.

I can afford to buy:  1. A studio apartment.  2. A home far outside of one of the 5 boroughs somewhere in New Jersey.  A decent 2 bedroom is $1.2 million!

969925717789216768 2018-03-03 13:21:26 UTC <ShaunKing> Every officer in this case should be fired. They concocted a fake story, arrested a man based on that stor, ruined his record, totaled his car.   All to cover for a reckless cop.https://twitter.com/danarubinstein/status/969648831020355585
969923505839116289 2018-03-03 13:12:38 UTC <ShaunKing> Yo. This is amazing. Just when you think one of them is a goner, they flip the script.https://twitter.com/i/moments/969694369711378432

969727691988570113 2018-03-02 00:14:33 UTC <ShaunKing> All 3 of these men are in custody for killing a cop.   Its amazing that they are alive and Freddie Gray and Tamir Rice and Rekia Boyd and Philando Castile are all dead.  I dont want these men killed.  I want non-violent Black folk to get the same respect as white murderers.pic.twitter.com/bP9YBKY5VU

969725442721804289 2018-03-02 00:05:36 UTC <ShaunKing> @TamikaDMallory @HRLori You can talk about Farrakhan all you want. She doesnt manage this mans social media and isnt responsible for it.
969708975934582784 2018-03-02 23:00:10 UTC <ShaunKing> @NormEisen I agree. We must condemn all bigotry from all sides. Always.
969706835484737538 2018-03-02 22:51:40 UTC <ShaunKing> @HRLori And, what ire? I am calm and cool. Defending a friend I know.
969706705843097602 2018-03-02 22:51:09 UTC <ShaunKing> @TamikaDMallory @JeffSmithi24 Have you ever been to a Black Church? We often use illustrations that clearly arent resonating with you that have nothing to do with anti-Semitism. I see the enemies of Jesus as the establishment.
969706439471255553 2018-03-02 22:50:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @HRLori I dont know him. I know @TamikaDMallory and anybody calling her a bigot is lying. Period.
969705295139262464 2018-03-02 22:45:33 UTC <ShaunKing> @HRLori My tweet is in support of Tamika. She is my friend. She is not a bigot. Saying so is a lie.
969705132421197825 2018-03-02 22:44:54 UTC <ShaunKing> Call out hate. I will call it out with you. As I have done for years. I loathe anti-Semitism.   But @TamikaDMallory is not a bigot. I wont allow it.https://twitter.com/popchassid/status/969693636890853376
969704634192416770 2018-03-02 22:42:55 UTC <ShaunKing> @PopChassid What? Im not calling you a liar. I am saying it is a lie to call @TamikaDMallory anti-Semitic. Period.
969700909835005953 2018-03-02 22:28:07 UTC <ShaunKing> @NormEisen 1. Nothing about my tweet is a straw-man.   2. Your thoughts and comments on Farrakhan are one thing.   3. Someone attending an event does not mean they agree with everything that person says. She doesnt. Period.
969699429270937600 2018-03-02 22:22:14 UTC <ShaunKing> We are almost there!!!  2,620 of you have now given $87,136 to help elect Judge Elizabeth Frizell as the new DA of Dallas!!!

969627865590452228 2018-03-02 17:37:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Absolutely.   No joke, so many people have said this about Nico Lahood.   You just couldn't make this guy up.https://twitter.com/cristianafarias/status/969627602972565506
969627394553384962 2018-03-02 17:36:00 UTC <ShaunKing> @sfjw THANK YOU!
969627322868486144 2018-03-02 17:35:43 UTC <ShaunKing> At least two people on the San Antonio Spurs told me they regretted ever supporting this man 4 years ago.   Another celebrity who endorsed him was so shell shocked by how much of a trainwreck he has been that she just won't endorse anybody anymore.   Nico Lahood is that bad.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/969620640717295616

969625204497506304 2018-03-02 17:27:18 UTC <ShaunKing> @Forrest4Trees Right. You all have some hilarious Democrats in Texas man.
969625075694612482 2018-03-02 17:26:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Several of my friends in San Antonio - fell for this dude.   His schtick is just a hustle.   He's a bigot. Period.   I'm strongly advocating that you vote for Joe Gonzalez to replace Nico LaHood.   Joe is a genuinely good man.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/969620640717295616
969624378165080064 2018-03-02 17:24:01 UTC <ShaunKing> Texans can have my back on what I'm about to say.  I had to spend time there to understand it.  Conservatives in large cities know they can't win as Republicans so they literally pretend to be progressive.   This man is a right wing bum.  It's happening in every big city in Texashttps://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/969620640717295616
969623306172354561 2018-03-02 17:19:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Every other day this man is appearing on cooky conservative conspiracy theory talk shows - doubling down on Infowars lies. It's a damn shame.   The State or National Democratic Party should oust him.   You'd be hard pressed to find a DA more like Donald Trump than this man.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/969620640717295616
969622679274868740 2018-03-02 17:17:16 UTC <ShaunKing> It turns out, Nico Lahood is as phony as a $3 bill.   He basically duped us all by making it out like he'd be a reformer because he had once been in the system.   He turned out to be a hard-nosed conservative. No reforms. No changes.   Same old law & order bullshit.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/969620640717295616
969622173068521472 2018-03-02 17:15:15 UTC <ShaunKing> Back in the day, Nico Lahood used to sell meth at clubs.   And he said he changed. I dug it like everybody else.   And based in huge part off the strength of that cool story - not his character - not his policies - he was elected District Attorney.   He's been a trainwreck.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/969620640717295616
969620640717295616 2018-03-02 17:09:10 UTC <ShaunKing> San Antonio.   Are you aware that your District Attorney, Nico Lahood, is a raving lunatic?  He is a Breitbart reading conservative.  He hates Muslims.  And loves the death penalty.  He's anti-vaccine.  Dude threatened people w/ violence.   He's a mess.   https://injusticetoday.com/san-antonio-da-nico-lahood-an-anti-islam-pro-death-penalty-democrat-faces-former-pal-in-primary-30ce65b007a0pic.twitter.com/L0K8p01ZIi

968934930825785346 2018-02-28 19:44:24 UTC <ShaunKing> I don't care how much Trump disses Jeff Sessions, I will never defend Sessions. Period.   When they fight, I see two enemies destroying each other.   Listen to me, the enemy of your enemy is NOT always your friend.   A good saying. Bad politics.

968895924041928705 2018-02-28 17:09:24 UTC <ShaunKing> @jasonebeling It's one of many solutions. The ban in CT happened after Sandy Hook.   We can't use the presence of one shooting cause us to say bans don't work. For all we know, those bans prevented dozens or hundreds of mass shootings.
968895468230070273 2018-02-28 17:07:35 UTC <ShaunKing> The United States was a shoe-in to host the 2026 soccer World Cup - the largest sports tournament in the world.

968870758469570560 2018-02-28 15:29:24 UTC <ShaunKing> It's wild that Starr says Mueller is "overstepping his mandate."  1. 20 years ago Ken Starr was asked to look into a suicide.   2. He ended up finding something else disturbing, but totally unrelated.   3. Clinton was impeached for the new finding.https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/28/politics/ken-starr-special-counsel-mandate-cnntv/index.html

968191812400746496 2018-02-26 18:31:30 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear New Jersey,  Do this. Democrats control every wing of government. Be smart here and make this happen.  We are watching.https://twitter.com/nj_isj/status/968122409336352769

968177344895705088 2018-02-26 17:34:01 UTC <ShaunKing> The man who avoided war 5 times by faking an injury just said he wouldve run into a school to confront a mass shooter even if he didnt have a weapon.https://twitter.com/zekejmiller/status/968155353912369152
968176871010701313 2018-02-26 17:32:08 UTC <ShaunKing> He actually said thishttps://twitter.com/zekejmiller/status/968170092180668419
968136129475170304 2018-02-26 14:50:15 UTC <ShaunKing> Just remember this every time Trump acts like he cares about Dreamers.   The man ended the program and has fought tooth and nail to keep it that way.https://twitter.com/reuters/status/968132182643499009

967941066551971840 2018-02-25 01:55:08 UTC <ShaunKing> Was going to take my wife and I to see Black Panther again today but it was sold out all day and night at our local theater.   I was simultaneously sad & glad at the same time.
967899387627298817 2018-02-25 23:09:31 UTC <ShaunKing> Texas.   This is who you need to elect as your next Senator.https://twitter.com/BetoORourke/status/967881688817729542
967844650672369666 2018-02-25 19:32:01 UTC <ShaunKing> Walking in Brooklyn.  I started hearing screams. Then saw grown women and children running in every direction.  In my own world, I couldnt make sense of it.  Then I saw a rat, as big as a cat, scrambling every which way.   And then I started running too! 
967832148014260224 2018-02-25 18:42:20 UTC <ShaunKing> This country is exhausting.
967811064023928834 2018-02-25 17:18:33 UTC <ShaunKing> Black Panther has now earned an astounding $704 million worldwide IN JUST 10 DAYS!  It set all types of new records this weekend as well.   #WakandaForeverhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/weekend-box-office-black-panther-scores-record-108m-second-outing-1088212
967806841051930624 2018-02-25 17:01:46 UTC <ShaunKing> Over a dozen different families of victims from the school shooting in Florida have now reported that they have received regular death threats since the shooting.   This is how ugly this country is.   They lost loved ones.   And are now receiving death threats.
967796337726164993 2018-02-25 16:20:02 UTC <ShaunKing> @franklinleonard That would be awesome.
967796116237508614 2018-02-25 16:19:09 UTC <ShaunKing> @ChristineEmba Good work.
967787531386413056 2018-02-25 15:45:02 UTC <ShaunKing> I think our public plan on gun reform has to be much more sophisticated.   I actually like what we all just did to pressure companies that were attached to the NRA. I think it makes the NRA the pariah that they should be.   But we need a plan that everybody knows and can act on.

967587665238482945 2018-02-24 02:30:50 UTC <ShaunKing> Hope you all enjoyed the live tweets from my 15 year old daughter, Kendi. She is so special.   Here are her tweets: https://twitter.com/search?q=kendi%20notesfromthefield&src=typd #NotesFromTheField
967587658485719045 2018-02-24 02:30:49 UTC <ShaunKing> #NotesFromTheField   Stellar storytelling, acting, writing, costuming, lighting, set design, and overall execution. A wonderful, POWERFUL, piece of art.   -Kendi K.
967587229462945792 2018-02-24 02:29:07 UTC <ShaunKing> @JamilahLemieux You still can, my friend.
967585863260606464 2018-02-24 02:23:41 UTC <ShaunKing> @repjohnlewis @AnnaDeavereS @rebel19 Absolutely
967585110773174273 2018-02-24 02:20:41 UTC <ShaunKing> The confederate flag is one of HATE. One used to represent white supremacy and induce fear among the black community for years.   Don't tell me it's "just a flag"  It is a hate symbol.  -Kendi K.  #NotesFromTheField
967584007851593728 2018-02-24 02:16:18 UTC <ShaunKing> God bless you @BreeNewsome.  You will always be my hero.   #NotesFromTheField
967583773712928769 2018-02-24 02:15:23 UTC <ShaunKing> We need to be reminded that when white supremacist Dylann Roof walked into a church in Charleston and shot & killed 9 people, he committed the deadliest hate crime against African Americans in 85 years.   WE LIVE IN THAT TIME.   We live in the that time.   #NotesFromTheField
967583173529014272 2018-02-24 02:13:00 UTC <ShaunKing> She has James Baldwin down!  #NotesFromTheField
967582626512064512 2018-02-24 02:10:49 UTC <ShaunKing> @AnnaDeavereS @HBO @ambertamblyn So glad you tuned in. We need more art like this!! Hope you are well.   #NotesFromTheField
967581480649199616 2018-02-24 02:06:16 UTC <ShaunKing> So many kids who are stressed, clinically, end up being put on meds and put in special ed.   But their foundational stress is ignored.  #NotesFromTheField
967581099164659713 2018-02-24 02:04:45 UTC <ShaunKing> #NotesFromTheField is a shining example of how art can tell important stories, shine the light on issues of social justice, and make us care so deeply about people we've never met.   Plays, an underestimated vessel for social change very close to my heart.  -Kendi K.
967578906470608896 2018-02-24 01:56:02 UTC <ShaunKing> @prufpruf @JamilahLemieux I be damned.
967578616438644737 2018-02-24 01:54:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Thank you all for making #NotesFromTheField trend nationwide.   Tune in now to @HBO if you still want to follow along.
967578432707153920 2018-02-24 01:54:09 UTC <ShaunKing> "Mind your business" said to us when we see something wrong and are told because it's not happening to us, it has nothing to do with us.   Racial injustice has to do with us.   IT IS OUR BUSINESS.   -Kendi K.  #NotesFromTheField
967576989229092865 2018-02-24 01:48:25 UTC <ShaunKing> This is what happens to Black children when you fill our schools with cops.   Officer Ben Fields brutally assaulted this young girl, flips her while in the chair, yanks her out, throws her across the room like a rag doll.   He was never held accountable.   #NotesFromTheFieldpic.twitter.com/tFoMawYQZo
967575616978636800 2018-02-24 01:42:58 UTC <ShaunKing> @JamilahLemieux I never heard that. Never heard it. I need to find that clip.

967575245778489345 2018-02-24 01:41:29 UTC <ShaunKing> Caden McCadden, 7 year old boy with ADHD, handcuffed in his school for doing what kids do, being hyper. The system starts treating black folks as criminals from the moment they enter schools.   -Kendi K.  #NotesFromTheField
967575155412258822 2018-02-24 01:41:08 UTC <ShaunKing> That ugly moment in McKinney, Texas when a cop was about to kill two young boys from a pool party.   This cop was never heard responsible for the multiple crimes he committed against kids that day.   #NotesFromTheFieldpic.twitter.com/l4aRxHsuEh
967574411707600896 2018-02-24 01:38:11 UTC <ShaunKing> My wife is a lifelong educator.   I can't tell you how many times she has told me about teachers and staff she's worked with who just don't like the kids they work with. None of them.   #NotesFromTheFieldhttps://twitter.com/joshuadubois/status/967573881740517377
967573075964432384 2018-02-24 01:32:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Young black men in this country often aren't taught to dream, aren't taught to look past the age of 18. That's the effect of the school to prison pipeline, where incarceration or death are offered as the only options.   -Kendi K.  #NotesFromTheField
967572737635078146 2018-02-24 01:31:31 UTC <ShaunKing> I am blown away by how @AnnaDeavereS is able to shape-shift her entire affect and body language in so many different ways to depict so many different men and women from across the country.   #NotesFromTheField
967571576681123841 2018-02-24 01:26:55 UTC <ShaunKing> Please follow my main man, one of the most important mayors in America -  @MichaelDTubbs. We have your back man. Rooting for you in Stockton.   #NotesFromTheField
967571299185852417 2018-02-24 01:25:48 UTC <ShaunKing> "No justice, no peace"   A chant I've screamed myself. Not a threat, but a cry, a plea, for action to be taken. For justice to be served. For police to be held accountable for the young black lives they take.   -Kendi K.  #NotesFromTheField
967571092197072897 2018-02-24 01:24:59 UTC <ShaunKing> I'm so grateful for the brave men and women in Baltimore, who marched and protested and made clear to that city that police brutality would not accepted silently.   #NotesFromTheField
967570750197690369 2018-02-24 01:23:38 UTC <ShaunKing> @FeministaJones I think most of the sermon was amazing, though.
967570432869195777 2018-02-24 01:22:22 UTC <ShaunKing> Standing, sitting, lying down, hands up, innocent black men, women, and children are still murdered by police. THAT is why people run. Because they know no matter what they are doing, their black skin will be seen as a threat.   -Kendi K.  #NotesFromTheField
967570295820378113 2018-02-24 01:21:49 UTC <ShaunKing> My God.   Thank you @jamalhbryant.   #NotesFromTheFieldhttps://twitter.com/joshuadubois/status/967569954194313216
967569926809628672 2018-02-24 01:20:21 UTC <ShaunKing> From my daughter, Kendi.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/967569459639672832
967569730516213761 2018-02-24 01:19:34 UTC <ShaunKing> @jamalhbryant I appreciate you brother. Standing with you.
967569459639672832 2018-02-24 01:18:30 UTC <ShaunKing> Kimani Gray, 16 year old boy killed by police in 2013. I remember seeing his picture and thinking how little he looked. How much he resembled my classmates, my cousins, my kid brother. Broke my heart.   Don't forget his name.  #NotesFromTheField
967569063953215493 2018-02-24 01:16:56 UTC <ShaunKing> When I got to Morehouse in 1997, @jamalhbryant had just graduated, but was already a legend on campus. Heard him speak on King Day that year and knew I wanted to do so much of what he was doing.   #NotesFromTheField
967568558946430981 2018-02-24 01:14:55 UTC <ShaunKing> Freddie Gray, Mike Brown, Jordan Edwards, Sandra Bland, names of victims we DO KNOW. Imagine the countless stories of police brutality we don't. Just because their names never made it on the news, doesn't mean their names don't matter.  -Kendi K.  #NotesFromTheField
967568345619943425 2018-02-24 01:14:04 UTC <ShaunKing> Remember when @BaltimorePolice and prosecutors arrested Allen Bullock and gave him a $500,000 bail like he just murdered someone while the cops who killed Freddie Gray were all set free.  #NoteFromTheFieldpic.twitter.com/uf49tQIU7S
967567714805043200 2018-02-24 01:11:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Shout out to Copwatch.   You all are veterans in monitoring the police.   #NotesFromTheField
967567492414656513 2018-02-24 01:10:41 UTC <ShaunKing> Freddie Gray suffered three fractured vertebrae, injuries to his voice box, and his spine 80% severed at his neck. Abused by police, for glancing in their direction.   -Kendi K.  #NotesFromTheField
967567036665815042 2018-02-24 01:08:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Tweet from my daughter about #NotesFromTheFieldhttps://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/967566649909022721
967566649909022721 2018-02-24 01:07:20 UTC <ShaunKing> Our country has the means and the ability, to invest in our failing mental health system, or our failing education system. We just put all that time and money into the prison system instead.  -Kendi K.  #NotesFromTheField
967566631294644224 2018-02-24 01:07:16 UTC <ShaunKing> Please remember that #FreddieGray never broke a single law to deserve being arrested in the first place.   He should be alive today.   #NotesFromTheField

967518939646447617 2018-02-24 21:57:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Where @ProPublica exposed a terrorist cell within the US border.   Theyve killed people.  They are training to kill more.

967419660114243584 2018-02-24 15:23:15 UTC <ShaunKing> It would only be a matter of time. Just like how all the police in schools have resulted in so many of our unarmed kids getting brutally assaulted by cops.pic.twitter.com/Q4PBU87qS5

967129930021646342 2018-02-23 20:11:58 UTC <ShaunKing> No. You should not be paid for land you stole and got rich off of.  Period.   In what scenario does a victim pay a criminal to get back what the criminal stole?https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/967066995534585858

967109599433297920 2018-02-23 18:51:11 UTC <ShaunKing> It's a ridiculous trade, to be honest.   Glad Marcus is getting the hell out of Kansas City.   It's arguably the best cornerback in the league.   I sincerely think they traded him because of his protests against police brutality.   PERIOD.https://twitter.com/TerezPaylor/status/967105935419244544

967085132875169793 2018-02-23 17:13:57 UTC <ShaunKing> @lindiwesuttle Agreed. It should be a comprehensive program with a plan that works. However, they should not have that land.

967066995534585858 2018-02-23 16:01:53 UTC <ShaunKing> South Africa's new President announces his intent to take back farm land.   Listen to me.   This needs to happen.   Black South Africans represent 79% of the nation, but only own 1.2% of the farm land. This is not OK.   It was stolen during colonization & apartheid.pic.twitter.com/LqXP88cut0
967063688866824194 2018-02-23 15:48:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Question: Did Trump's team not find this out themselves? They man lied and said he was a high ranking medical executive.   He was a clerk at a hospital.   The media should not have had to find that out ourselves.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/967003606904811521
967053273449615361 2018-02-23 15:07:22 UTC <ShaunKing> @ProfRonSullivan @esglaude No hoax. Did you see the source documents I embedded? Over and over again the NCAA called on a prison labor case relying on the 13th Amendment to justify not paying players
967052424929316864 2018-02-23 15:03:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Here the NCAA begins their public lies.   Over and over and over again, six times, over several years and legal arguments, the NCAA cited cases of prison labor, and the 13th Amendment to defend their practice of not properly paying athleteshttps://twitter.com/ncaastacey/status/966857518361317376
967052421305372672 2018-02-23 15:03:58 UTC <ShaunKing> @NCAAStacey @1SadRebel They did indeed.
967052419594059779 2018-02-23 15:03:58 UTC <ShaunKing> @k_trahan Absolutely. They leaned on it repeatedly
966801619743662081 2018-02-22 22:27:23 UTC <ShaunKing> @BYP_100 Exactly
966801480392040453 2018-02-22 22:26:49 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. Then, understand just how outrageous it is for the NCAA to form their legal lips to say Vanskike v. Peters, which is about prisons not paying inmates, supports their argument that NCAA athletes do not have to be paid.
966801166154727424 2018-02-22 22:25:34 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. When you can, read Vanskike v. Peters in full.   Read the footnotes too.   See where the courts ruled that inmates don't have to be paid or even treated according to all federal employment rules for their work BECAUSE OF THE 13TH AMENDMENT.https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/974/806/437621/
966800185937580032 2018-02-22 22:21:41 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. It is both absolutely gross and racist that lawyers for the @NCAA called on Vanskike v. Peters, where prisoners weren't paid for their work because of the 13th Amendment, to justify their arguments that NCAA athletes should not be paid either.
966799778834153474 2018-02-22 22:20:04 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. And the judge was correct, in fact.   Please watch @13THFilm by @ava for background.   Or read The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander.   The 13th Amendment absolutely LEGALIZED modern American slavery for people who've been convicted of a crime.   So....
966799355712811008 2018-02-22 22:18:23 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. In Vanskike v. Peters (Vanskike was the prison inmate & Peters was the head of prisons in Indiana) the judge ruled that Indiana didn't have to pay prisoners a federal minimum wage or give federal worker protections.  In the decision, guess what the judge cited?  13th Amendment
966798362216402944 2018-02-22 22:14:26 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. In 1992, an Indiana prison inmate, Daniel Vanskike, argued that it was unfair that he was forced to work, often for for-profit businesses, without being paid a minimum wage.   The judge ruled against Vanskike.   Let me explain why...
966797557249822725 2018-02-22 22:11:14 UTC <ShaunKing> In 6 different cases where former NCAA athletes have sued to have their work either paid under work study or minimum wage, the NCAA has cited in their response one nefarious case:  Vanskike v. Peters of 1992.  You should that case for yourself: https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/974/806/437621/https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/966760079822409728

966779592487899136 2018-02-22 20:59:51 UTC <ShaunKing> @RogerPielkeJr We just embedded more of the documents there for you to review too
966779203914956801 2018-02-22 20:58:18 UTC <ShaunKing> @NCAA @DonteStallworth Same here bro. What a mess.
966766641106350080 2018-02-22 20:08:23 UTC <ShaunKing> In addition to the documents we have embedded in my piece, we obtained legal documents from 3 additional times the NCAA cited the 13th Amendment and slave labor as their primary justification for not paying student athletes.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/966760079822409728
966766109708947456 2018-02-22 20:06:16 UTC <ShaunKing> Students who take tickets to the games get paid.   Students who work concessions at the games get paid.   Students who serve as ushers at the games get paid.   Many, as work study students, but the NCAA is saying that athletes are not obligated to be paid.   Cited 13th Amendment.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/966760079822409728
966762883286818816 2018-02-22 19:53:27 UTC <ShaunKing> @NCAA @salaams_from_68 No joke man.
966760079822409728 2018-02-22 19:42:19 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.  Took my breath away.   Lawyers for the @NCAA are arguing in legal documents that we obtained that they dont have to pay student athletes because the 13th Amendment allows unpaid slave labor.  Yes, Im serious.https://theintercept.com/2018/02/22/ncaa-student-athletes-unpaid-prison/

966721763651604480 2018-02-22 17:10:03 UTC <ShaunKing> A lot of people are, rightfully so, commenting that the NRA appears scared.  But listen, they are a fear-based organization. The core ethic that drives them is fear. They stay afraid.  They are afraid of everybody & everything but conservatives white people. Period.
966716707460079616 2018-02-22 16:49:58 UTC <ShaunKing> @zachbaron Beautifully done

966675057555755008 2018-02-22 14:04:28 UTC <ShaunKing> This has EVERYTHING to do with Donald Trump.  The enormous spike in hate crimes, including dozens and dozens of murders, and the public rise of Neo-Nazism, is the exact length of Trumps candidacy, election, and presidency.  The president elected by hate.https://twitter.com/splcenter/status/966350080537169920
966638274210156544 2018-02-22 11:38:18 UTC <ShaunKing> OMG.   I just saw where Donald Trump literally said to a father of a school shooting victim that his solution for mass shootings is arming teachers with guns.   This is what happens when politicians are bought and paid for by the NRA.

965786180280254465 2018-02-19 03:12:23 UTC <ShaunKing> That was rough.   #HBCURising.   Y'all ok?
965785675239952388 2018-02-19 03:10:23 UTC <ShaunKing> Do you hear that racist asshole? He had the nerve to say that #LeonardBrown & #DenverSmith were killed because students occupied the building.   THE SCHOOL PRESIDENT WAS NOT EVEN IN THE BUILDING.  #HBCURising
965785438026944512 2018-02-19 03:09:26 UTC <ShaunKing> #LeonardBrown  &   #DenverSmith  We say your names. Peaceful students who were murdered by police at Southern University. They weren't even protestors.   #HBCURising  1972.pic.twitter.com/xVFdIGzOmS
965785016742633472 2018-02-19 03:07:46 UTC <ShaunKing> November 16, 1972.   A horrible, despicable date in history for Southern University when peaceful Black protestors were targeted, brutalized, and KILLED.   300 cops swarmed the campus with guns and tanks & unloaded on them.   #HBCURising
965783986684514304 2018-02-19 03:03:40 UTC <ShaunKing> When black teenagers get together at HBCUs, STYLE and CULTURE is born. Big hair, bright clothes, new music and slang, black people have controlled what's in for forever.  -Kendi.  #HBCURising

965783498006155264 2018-02-19 03:01:43 UTC <ShaunKing> Black college campuses were flooded with military policing, they tried to use fear to stop protests. Just like they did in Ferguson after the death of Mike Brown.  -Kendi.  #HBCURising
965783389570830336 2018-02-19 03:01:18 UTC <ShaunKing> This is a difficult section to watch and a piece of history that deserves more attention. Lean in. #HBCURising

965782079530323969 2018-02-19 02:56:05 UTC <ShaunKing> Folks walked down the street, singing hymns as they protested. They were beaten, hosed, attacked by police dogs, and arrested. For walking and singing.  -Kendi.  #HBCURising
965781839838437376 2018-02-19 02:55:08 UTC <ShaunKing> My God those protestors were so bold, so brave, so dignified.   Brings me almost to tears to see how disciplined they were in the face of such horrible ugliness.   Those bigots were so damn mean and nasty.   STILL ARE.   #HBCURising
965781700923019264 2018-02-19 02:54:35 UTC <ShaunKing> YOUNG BLACK STUDENTS lead the protests that ended segregation in America. The power of the youth is so often underestimated and under appreciated.  -Kendi.  #HBCURising

965781198638387200 2018-02-19 02:52:35 UTC <ShaunKing> Those first young black men and women to stage sit-ins at white counters are some of the bravest unspoken heroes of American history.  -Kendi.  #HBCURising
965780805418176512 2018-02-19 02:51:02 UTC <ShaunKing> So many protests and sit-ins of the Civil Rights Movement were done by HBCU students all over the South in North Carolina, in Nashville, in Atlanta.   Such a rich legacy of protests.   #HBCURising
965780766511828993 2018-02-19 02:50:52 UTC <ShaunKing> "I'm for segregation because it's biblical"  People to this day find a way to use the bible to justify bigotry.  -Kendi.  #HBCURising

965780086313160704 2018-02-19 02:48:10 UTC <ShaunKing> What were white people so afraid of? If they continuously called black people 'inferior' and 'incapable', why go through so much just to tear us down?   #HBCURising   -Tae
965779787108282368 2018-02-19 02:46:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Charles Hamilton Houstons vision took 20 years to be realized.   Good reminder that the moral arc may bend towards justice, but that arc is long.    Sometimes we plant seeds today that we may not see grow until after we pass away. We have to play the long game.   #HBCURising

965775090091724802 2018-02-19 02:28:19 UTC <ShaunKing> So many painful parallels between early #HBCUs and Christian schools for Native American children.   Paternalism and subservience was at the core. #HBCURising

965774236282482689 2018-02-19 02:24:55 UTC <ShaunKing> I think we must at least accept that what Booker T. did was create an opportunity for Black colleges to grow and flourish.   Where he was problematic, others did better, but he did help open the door.   #HBCURising
965773870048346112 2018-02-19 02:23:28 UTC <ShaunKing> YES!!  "We refuse to kiss the hand that smites us, but rather insist on striving by all civilized methods to gain every right and privilege open to free American citizens."    -W.E.B. DuBois. #HBCURising

965773463242854400 2018-02-19 02:21:51 UTC <ShaunKing> We have to come to grips with WHY Booker T. was so beloved by whites in his time. It's problematic.   #HBCURising
965773044873617408 2018-02-19 02:20:11 UTC <ShaunKing> White people DENIED black folks access to education, then insisted they were ONLY capable of manual labor because they had no education.   -Kendi.  #HBCURising
965772570724327425 2018-02-19 02:18:18 UTC <ShaunKing> @_CultureFreedom me too. it was a miracle.
965772292734226432 2018-02-19 02:17:12 UTC <ShaunKing> A young Booker T. Washington literally walked across the entire state of Virginia to get to Hampton to go to school. He was so determined.   #HBCURising.
965771872410456064 2018-02-19 02:15:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Between 1866 - 1872 approximately 20,000 folk were lynched in the South in pursuit of education and freedom.   20,000.  20,000.  TWENTY THOUSAND   #HBCURising  The HBCU's that made it were MIRACLES.
965771772984471552 2018-02-19 02:15:08 UTC <ShaunKing> Black people knew with education came opportunity. So they founded their own schools with black founders, board members, and teachers. Schools that produced excellence.  -Kendi.  #HBCURising
965771323363348480 2018-02-19 02:13:21 UTC <ShaunKing> The first #HBCUs were created out of Christian churches. Like Indian schools, they were meant to attempt to make formerly enslaved African Americans adopt white culture.   #AME churches said nah and  started challenging that idea. #HBCURising
965770067353964544 2018-02-19 02:08:21 UTC <ShaunKing> Slavery was full of brutality. The rarely discussed brutality of ignorance, withholding education and knowledge from slaves, was essential in keeping black people enslaved.   #HBCURising  -Kendi.
965769807898476544 2018-02-19 02:07:19 UTC <ShaunKing> Wow.   @Yale & the Mayor of New Haven Connecticut protested the possibility of having a Black college in the town.   I never knew that.   #HBCURising

Real talk though, they need to audition people for this or something. This never shouldve gone down.   I need a 30 for 30 on this.https://twitter.com/caleb_bortner/status/965399352083668994

965463075691233280 2018-02-18 05:48:29 UTC <ShaunKing> Again, this man is just miles away from where 17 kids were shot to death and many more critically injured and he's tweeting insults to Oprah Winfrey.   It's despicable.   SHAME ON EVERY PERSON WHO VOTED FOR THIS MAN.   SHAME ON YOU.   He projects his weaknesses onto others.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/965442990134251520
965462430234034177 2018-02-18 05:45:55 UTC <ShaunKing> Several Asian friends of mine reached out to tell me JJ said something awful.   I assure you that was not his intention. He would never say such a thing. Period.   JJ is not a low-key racist. He's anti-racist ally. I know him and trust him.   I'm asking my friends to do the same.https://twitter.com/JJRedick/status/965277620823822336
965461408862187520 2018-02-18 05:41:51 UTC <ShaunKing> JJ Redick is my friend.  I know to most of you he's just a guy on a basketball court, but the moment I heard people saying he used a racial slur toward Asians I knew it wasn't true.  Anybody who knows him, knows this.  The moment I saw the video I knew what he says here happened.https://twitter.com/JJRedick/status/965443290324664320

965367509133115392 2018-02-18 23:28:44 UTC <ShaunKing> While Trump is just miles away from the site of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida at his resort, he has now tweeted over a dozen times about Russia since he arrived in Florida.   He has no interest in tackling the plague of school shootings in America.   None at all.

Im not voting for him, but the best available candidates should all run. Unlike 2016.   All stars fight it out. Best wins. Like 2008.https://twitter.com/nbcnewyork/status/965090195115855872

965262672915845120 2018-02-18 16:32:09 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump's tweets are important. I think it is foolish to claim otherwise.  HOWEVER, you must never allow his tweets to dictate your time or agenda. Or even your emotions.   He is addicted to the consequences and attention of his tweets. Guard your heart when it comes to him.
965259481625038853 2018-02-18 16:19:28 UTC <ShaunKing> Read this article and then think of all of Black Panther.   No, I'm not kidding.   This is exactly what Erik Killmonger was trying to warn Wakanda of.https://twitter.com/theintercept/status/965257604539830272
965257623623880709 2018-02-18 16:12:05 UTC <ShaunKing> @ColinCole91 hilarious! Was talking about the weak dunk.
965253213699047427 2018-02-18 15:54:34 UTC <ShaunKing> @attackerman USA was not made for vegans. That's for sure.
965251862692794368 2018-02-18 15:49:12 UTC <ShaunKing> Being a vegan on the road is incredibly hard. It's one thing when I'm in NYC, but I'm in Montana, then West Virginia.
965236354807418882 2018-02-18 14:47:34 UTC <ShaunKing> We're not coming to play.   Since you won't make the reforms we've requested, we'll take over the system and make them ourselves.

965223974866124800 2018-02-18 13:58:23 UTC <ShaunKing> I'm furious!   Police in Darby, Pennsylvania arrested an 11 year old girl. She weighs 55 pounds and is in the 5th grade. Handcuffed her. Put her in a police car.   After an argument on her elementary school bus.   This is the criminalization of Blackness.  http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/jenice_armstrong/darby-cops-arrest-of-11-year-old-girl-was-excessive-jenice-armstrong-20180215.htmlpic.twitter.com/zdnflr3mzX

965189788725862401 2018-02-18 11:42:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Its not just unethical, but evil that our nation continues to allow school shootings to happen with no measurable action whatsoever.  Gun control may be years or decades away.  We must make our schools like our airports or federal buildings.   An essential interim solution.

965000175080148992 2018-02-17 23:09:05 UTC <ShaunKing> To all potential presidential and congressional candidates:  Make smart, comprehensive gun reform a part of your platform.  Make it courageous.   The nation is ready for this. We can leave the NRA behind.
964986805673218049 2018-02-17 22:15:57 UTC <ShaunKing> Knee jerk? These mass shootings have been non stop for a decade!!!  Data is abundant. This is what it looks like to be bought and paid for by the @NRAhttps://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/964329774696017921

964876031122399234 2018-02-17 14:55:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Do we have a record, an account, of politicians who support a total ban on assault weapons and other weapons of war?
964867589045448705 2018-02-17 14:22:14 UTC <ShaunKing> @RSGAT I agree. Absolutely
964867492077297664 2018-02-17 14:21:51 UTC <ShaunKing> I agree.   City by city, state by state, we must ban weapons of war.  A federal ban is nowhere in sight because Republicans are bought and paid for by the NRA.  States could even refuse to do business with any states that continue to sell weapons of war.https://twitter.com/robbynlewis46th/status/964843971959820288
964834006738063360 2018-02-17 12:08:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Question: Can a city or a state ban assault weapons like the AR-15? Not just the sell of them, but possession or ownership?  Or does it have to be Congress?

964631570471686144 2018-02-16 22:44:23 UTC <ShaunKing> We're learning that the FBI was not contact just once, but apparently twice about Nikolas Cruz.   What we know is that the Florida shooter simply does not fit the profile of the type of person Trump & Sessions see as a threat.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/964619629221031936
964622283452092417 2018-02-16 22:07:28 UTC <ShaunKing> The greatest existential threat to white people & their safety/security is, w/o a doubt....white people.  But because the white security apparatus mainly thinks of people of color, immigrants, & Muslims as their greatest threat, they miss warning signs.https://theintercept.com/2018/02/16/florida-shooting-nikolas-cruz/
964619629221031936 2018-02-16 21:56:56 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.   WHITENESS.   Whiteness is what allowed Nikolas Cruz to get to the point where he shot & killed 17 kids.   Had he presented as ANYTHING other than white, the 62 previous warning signs I counted would've been more than enough to stop him.   https://theintercept.com/2018/02/16/florida-shooting-nikolas-cruz/
964615272580767744 2018-02-16 21:39:37 UTC <ShaunKing> @blueapron @MickMulvaneyOMB @realDonaldTrump @JosephNSanberg Exactly man!
964590340643741696 2018-02-16 20:00:33 UTC <ShaunKing> Netanyahu was just indicted for bribery and corruption.  So Donald Trump invited him to be his special guest at the White House next month.https://nypost.com/2018/02/16/trump-to-host-netanyahu-at-white-house-next-month/
964587284094967815 2018-02-16 19:48:24 UTC <ShaunKing> @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell @RubenBolling I agree.
964525906416070656 2018-02-16 15:44:30 UTC <ShaunKing> One of the most heroic things I've ever seen a police officer say about gun violence and guns in America in my entire life.   I commend this man.   Listen, we have to follow his lead and make this a primary issue. All of us.https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/964506734676140032
964497489243115521 2018-02-16 13:51:35 UTC <ShaunKing> What Ronan details here is extremely troubling, but I think our nation has gotten so used to Trump's immorality that we are numb to it.  I think this is clear evidence that Trump himself could not pass a background check for security clearance.https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal
964496109170315264 2018-02-16 13:46:06 UTC <ShaunKing> A very important report from Ronan Farrow detailing yet another affair Donald Trump had while married to Melania.   It's not just the affair, which is bad all by itself, but the payoffs & hidden legal entities created to keep them a secret.   https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal

964484931731841024 2018-02-16 13:01:41 UTC <ShaunKing> Is Donald Trump a traitor?  An astonishing, thorough report from the legendary James Risen.  Read this and allow it to wake you up to where we really are right now.https://theintercept.com/2018/02/16/trump-russia-election-hacking-investigation/
964473208631169025 2018-02-16 12:15:06 UTC <ShaunKing> White supremacy.   Shes a horrible bigot. And the thing about bigotry is that it cant hide. It exposes itself...always.

964246118149259266 2018-02-15 21:12:44 UTC <ShaunKing> In the United States, small towns and schools that most of the nation has never heard of get famous because of violence.   Newtown Ferguson Parkland Aurora Columbine

964214486063374336 2018-02-15 19:07:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Drastically changing how we fight for justice in America.   My political future. I hope you'll join me.   5,000 words on where we are, how we got here, and what's next.https://medium.com/@ShaunKing/drastically-changing-how-we-fight-for-justice-in-america-bea5ce648b41
964204561148788737 2018-02-15 18:27:36 UTC <ShaunKing> Imagine for just a moment that a radical terrorist cell OF MUSLIMS INSIDE OF AMERICA openly claimed they provided para-military training for a MUSLIM man who shot and killed 17 American schoolchildren.  Imagine him being from a country on Trump's banned list.   What would happen?
964200459790700546 2018-02-15 18:11:18 UTC <ShaunKing> Many of the violent white supremacists who assaulted people in Charlottesville, and served as key leaders there, live in Florida and run para-military operations.   @splcenter has documented them all very well.
964200305540911106 2018-02-15 18:10:41 UTC <ShaunKing> White supremacy is terrorism.   White supremacists are terrorists.   And they are all deeply emboldened by Donald Trump. They openly tell you that he represents them.
964199640546627585 2018-02-15 18:08:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Let me translate this for you.   A radical terrorist cell in America trained a man who just murdered 17 children in Florida.https://twitter.com/AP/status/964197379141455872
964199157102673920 2018-02-15 18:06:07 UTC <ShaunKing> BREAKING: White supremacists are now openly claiming that the Florida shooter was a member of their organization.   AGAIN, violent white supremacy is the greatest threat facing this nation.  From Charleston to Charlottesville to Parkland.  And Trump wants to build a wall.
964169293813428224 2018-02-15 16:07:27 UTC <ShaunKing> Making an announcement at 2pm EST today.   Today cannot be a day off.
964167142643064832 2018-02-15 15:58:54 UTC <ShaunKing> A grave injustice.https://twitter.com/NYDailyNews/status/964152803504611329

964122496009154561 2018-02-15 13:01:30 UTC <ShaunKing> I see at least one thing changing about mass shootings in America.   People are angry. Very, very angry.   The devastation is still there, of course, but our nation is growing increasingly furious about the lack of genuine concern from politicians.
964110488413048832 2018-02-15 12:13:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Good morning friends.   I'm up next on the Tom Joyner Morning Show (@TJMShow).
964109723002949638 2018-02-15 12:10:44 UTC <ShaunKing> @CourtWatchNYC @VOCALNewYork @BKBailFund @5BoroDefenders It's the only way it will work for 2,400 DA's nationwide.
963990146835238912 2018-02-14 04:15:35 UTC <ShaunKing> Ban AR-15s.   And anything like them.
963892072985120774 2018-02-14 21:45:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Here's the hustle.   If you can't talk about gun violence the day of or the day after a mass shooting, you can never talk about it at all, because the shootings happen every few days.   We're in a perpetual state of "now is not the time."
963890930406305793 2018-02-14 21:41:20 UTC <ShaunKing> The United States is not #1 in much.   Not education, not healthcare, not economic equality, none of that.   We're #1 in mass shootings and mass incarceration. It's not even close.   That's where we lead. This is what we're the best at.
963890478839156736 2018-02-14 21:39:33 UTC <ShaunKing> Over & over again, witnesses and victims to mass shootings believe they were being shot at by 3 or 4 people.   It's because it's so easy for one person to buy outrageous guns & unlimited ammo that it gives people the impression they are being shot at a by a small group.
963867526953398272 2018-02-14 20:08:20 UTC <ShaunKing> @The305MVP Did you see his testimony at his Senate hearing?
963867258291355650 2018-02-14 20:07:16 UTC <ShaunKing> He should absolutely primary Trump.https://twitter.com/buzzfeedben/status/963866866065297409
963867081560285184 2018-02-14 20:06:34 UTC <ShaunKing> @gregdice Challenge him on that. I did. He evolved. And explained votes that had much more nuance.
963866443510108166 2018-02-14 20:04:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Heres the thing. I had questions for @CoryBooker. He then meticulously answered them. And also showed areas where he grew and evolved.   Just open your mind. Hes a man of integrity. Works hard as hell.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/963865495345778689
963865495345778689 2018-02-14 20:00:16 UTC <ShaunKing> Many of my most progressive friends still have not quite accepted Cory Booker - claiming to be irked by a few votes. They then dont apply that same standard to other people they love, almost without scrutiny.  Im a fan. Spoke with the man. One of the most genuine souls.
963864757114757120 2018-02-14 19:57:20 UTC <ShaunKing> An essential move.   Let me tell you what it does, in case you arent quite clear...  It makes you beholden to the people. If you dont resonate with the grassroots, your campaigns wont have any money.  Changes everything.https://twitter.com/corybooker/status/963613148078071808
963863866907283457 2018-02-14 19:53:48 UTC <ShaunKing> Yes!!! So glad to see this. Its one of the best policy proposals in the nation right now.https://twitter.com/corybooker/status/963821492650815488

963805859993341952 2018-02-14 16:03:18 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. Now Shaun White apologizes for calling the sexual misconduct charges against him "gossip."  2. The evidence was overwhelming & he settled the suit.  3. He says he's changed since he was younger, but he settled the lawsuit 2 years ago.   4. He was 29.http://www.espn.com/olympics/winter18/story/_/id/22431539/shaun-white-calls-sexual-harassment-allegations-2016-lawsuit-gossip
963803738497482759 2018-02-14 15:54:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Ground Zero for why Donald Trump is not actually saying anything about domestic violence himself.   His own wife, Ivana, under oath, testified that he brutally assaulted her in a fit of rage.   Her account was confirmed with multiple friends.pic.twitter.com/HuafR1SyCT

He spent my whole life and 2/3rds of his in prison for a brutal crime he did not commit.   Shameful is an understatement. Its criminal.

963497218476072960 2018-02-13 19:36:52 UTC <ShaunKing> I see this as a presidential litmus test as well, to be honest.   I won't support the candidacy of any person who takes corporate PAC money.

963484477103198209 2018-02-13 18:46:14 UTC <ShaunKing> This was written in 2001. The Harvard Crimson.  It's entitled "Bringing Hate to Harvard."  Guess who students said was helping to bring the hate to campus?  Robert Porter, class of 2002.http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2001/10/31/bringing-hate-to-harvard-for-those/
963482475354828800 2018-02-13 18:38:17 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump's bestie. They have fawned over each other publicly for a few years now.   This makes sense.   He's a genuinely horrible human being.

963479749925289984 2018-02-13 18:27:27 UTC <ShaunKing> A very, very big deal. Bernie has always led out front on this.  So encouraged to see @SenGillibrand make this decision for herself. Its about integrity.https://twitter.com/sengillibrand/status/963478930911997952
963479095098073088 2018-02-13 18:24:51 UTC <ShaunKing> Several classmates of Rob Porters at Harvard told me they believed he was a white supremacist then.   Said he helped invite Ann Coulter to speak, introduced her, and widely defended her.
963473583858057216 2018-02-13 18:02:57 UTC <ShaunKing> On the plane from the East Coast to the West Coast I watched entire testimony of the Intelligence Community before the Senate.  I think its clearer than ever that the Trump administration has widespread abuse of the security clearance process.  Immediate clear reforms are urgent
963472575111208960 2018-02-13 17:58:57 UTC <ShaunKing> Correct me if Im wrong, but if the FBI completed the background check of Rob Porter last July, and he didnt get his security clearance then, doesnt this mean the White House has known since then that he would not be cleared?https://twitter.com/jdiamond1/status/963439712697569280
963464512471908352 2018-02-13 17:26:54 UTC <ShaunKing> Wow. This is progress as the country looks for better leadership with much more integrity.   I so badly wish our nation would recall Trump.https://twitter.com/i/moments/963389585744187392

963378678511079425 2018-02-13 11:45:50 UTC <ShaunKing> The plan is an absolute mess.  I didnt expect otherwise, but I had a tiny sliver of hope that it might be at least average or ambitious.  Its neither. The plan itself sucks. And it doesnt fund itself in any reasonable way.  All while essential programs are slashed. Despicable.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/963362959463469058

962678496647671808 2018-02-11 13:23:33 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump and conservatives have exploded the national debt.   Just to be clear, conservatives have next to nothing that they ACTUALLY care about.https://www.yahoo.com/news/stimulus-puts-us-debt-upward-trajectory-193132670.html
962552283287482370 2018-02-10 05:02:02 UTC <ShaunKing> This is a reform that all people, from all parties, should be willing to address immediatelyhttps://twitter.com/zellieimani/status/962340095339761664
962532640594321408 2018-02-10 03:43:59 UTC <ShaunKing> I think what we are learning from Kelly (and Flynn) is two fold:  1. Many military leaders appear great at a distance, but are actually horrible when you get up close.   2.

962384862865915909 2018-02-10 17:56:46 UTC <ShaunKing> Let me tell what's not DUE PROCESS.   Due Process is NOT beating, punching, choking, and burning women, driving over their feet with cars, smashing bottles on their faces...  AND GETTING A JOB IN THE WHITE HOUSE.  Due Process was railroaded when you gave these horrible men jobs.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/962348831789797381
962383737387352068 2018-02-10 17:52:17 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. You falsely accused 5 young boys of rape in New York and called for them to receive the death penalty. They went to prison for over a decade.   2. Your staff members beat, burned, maimed, punched, and choked women.   They were given restraining orders. Photos were taken.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/962348831789797381

962373913937289216 2018-02-10 17:13:15 UTC <ShaunKing> The phrase "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" has never applied to Black people in this country.   Many of Trump's current enemies are despicable neo-conservatives who have never, not once, been friends of ours.   They can be right.   But don't mistake them as your friends.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/962364838033920000

962112639555002368 2018-02-09 23:55:03 UTC <ShaunKing> Now it comes out that Trump has been privately trying to convince people that Rob Porters ex-wives made all of this up to damage him.

961824724870316034 2018-02-08 04:50:58 UTC <ShaunKing> We should pass a new law stating that presidential candidates must be approved for a security clearance.   Even if it is done state by state.https://twitter.com/aterkel/status/961780183249444869
961820230509985793 2018-02-08 04:33:07 UTC <ShaunKing> Furthermore, I do not believe for a single second that Trump, his attorneys, Chief of Staff John Kelly, and the dozen other White House staff members could testify under oath or before Mueller about their disgusting handling of Rob Porter.   Theyve lied repeatedly already.
961819405188395011 2018-02-08 04:29:50 UTC <ShaunKing> A law MUST be passed immediately that requires White House staff members to have verified security clearance.  It is unacceptable that Trump is abusing the temporary clearance and renews them indefinitely for staffers who cannot get approved otherwise.
961818509268238336 2018-02-08 04:26:16 UTC <ShaunKing> I genuinely believe the unfolding scandal of the entire White House protecting, covering, and promoting a violent, serial abuser of women, then lying about it, while he dates another staffer, is one of the worst things Ive ever seen in national politics.

961730552415117312 2018-02-08 22:36:46 UTC <ShaunKing> Rob Porter was so violently abusive that his ex-wife called the police for help on multiple occasions.  She told this to the FBI who refused to grant him a security clearance.  Trump still made him his right hand man and General Kelly defended him as late as yesterday.

The injustice of what the NFL has done to Colin Kaepernick is despicable.  Jimmy Garoppolo has started 7 games in 4 years. Heres what he did.pic.twitter.com/Vn1UCZ6YZo
961710369390678016 2018-02-08 21:16:34 UTC <ShaunKing> @getnickwright Moves were very underrated
961700591104864256 2018-02-08 20:37:43 UTC <ShaunKing> Absolutely disgusting that Amer Adi was just deported. Unthinkable.  His wife and 4 children are all American citizens.  He owned successful businesses and employed people in the community.  He embodied the American dream.  Shame on Trump & conservatives.https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/08/middleeast/deportee-us-intl/index.html
961694922423271424 2018-02-08 20:15:11 UTC <ShaunKing> The stock market is now down 625 points. The past 10 days have been a bloodbath.   Trump continues to remain absolutely silent about it.   His obnoxious sons are literally tweeting about Hillary Clinton.
961679183226331136 2018-02-08 19:12:39 UTC <ShaunKing> Hey Friends,  Just made this announcement on Facebook.   Stepping out next week into one of the most important moves of my life.

961651419362349057 2018-02-08 17:22:19 UTC <ShaunKing> It's all bullshit  The founders owned human beings and raped women  The Bible declares that the love of money is the root of all evil, but you've built your life pursuing it.

961638338578010113 2018-02-08 16:30:20 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.  Even though Colin Kaepernick is still effectively banned from the NFL, heres why I think the season long grassroots boycott of the league by his supporters was a historic moment in the fight against injustice in America.https://theintercept.com/2018/02/08/nfl-boycott-super-bowl-colin-kaepernick/

961634103115337728 2018-02-08 16:13:31 UTC <ShaunKing> Nothing about them was new. The whole White House knew Rob Porter was a violent abuser of women.   And Kelly is a bum. This notion that you trust a man simply because he served a long time in the military is dead, too.https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/961583176761200640

961579043551399936 2018-02-08 12:34:43 UTC <ShaunKing> @JohnJHarwood Hey John. Question - didn't Kelly say yesterday that he didn't know?

961452073031266304 2018-02-07 04:10:11 UTC <ShaunKing> Just finished that new @GQMagazine interview w/ Quincy Jones. Damn that was good.  I swear hes the most interesting man in the world.   I dont even wanna ruin it for you, but it has all new stuff.https://www.gq.com/story/quincy-jones-has-a-story
961431586049806338 2018-02-07 02:48:47 UTC <ShaunKing> So many people at the White House knew Rob Porter punched and choked and verbally abused his ex-wives, but did nothing whatsoever.   Now people who did know are claiming they didn't.https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/02/07/politics/rob-porter-white-house-who-knew/index.html
961430420431699968 2018-02-07 02:44:09 UTC <ShaunKing> @JenniferJJacobs Does that mean he is saying he didn't know?
961429076241256449 2018-02-07 02:38:48 UTC <ShaunKing> @jeffreylwilson Just saw it today for the first time. I had no idea man
961427739868835840 2018-02-07 02:33:30 UTC <ShaunKing> This was life before social media. Before 24/7 news.  Before celebrity gossip shows. Before TMZ.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/961427494476898305
961427494476898305 2018-02-07 02:32:31 UTC <ShaunKing> Have listened to Richard Pryor my whole life. Most of what I learned about storytelling and public speaking I got from listening to his tapes & watching his concerts as a kid.   I'd never seen this.   At 14:50, Richard openly talks about being bi-sexual.http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2e34yv
961390950168834048 2018-02-07 00:07:18 UTC <ShaunKing> @juddgreenstein Right
961390850163998720 2018-02-07 00:06:55 UTC <ShaunKing> To be clear, Rob Porter is Donald Trump's right hand man - his personal secretary. He helps write Trump's speeches.   He could not even get a full security clearance.   He beat both of his ex-wives. They documented it.   The White House knew all of this.pic.twitter.com/553BS0ptbq

961358055412772866 2018-02-07 21:56:36 UTC <ShaunKing> I think Bryan Stevenson should consider running for President. Dead serious.

961320814221185024 2018-02-07 19:28:37 UTC <ShaunKing> Let me understand something.   Senate Democrats have agreed to a budget without even including DACA protections?

961309665895354368 2018-02-07 18:44:19 UTC <ShaunKing> This is an absolute bombshell.   Two ex-wives of senior White House aide, Rob Porter, told the FBI that he physically abused them. Each had evidence, photos.  THE WHITE HOUSE THEN HIRED HIM ANYWAY.  The 5th physically abusive man in this White House.https://theintercept.com/2018/02/07/rob-porter-wives-abuse-trump-aide/

961258088765558784 2018-02-07 15:19:22 UTC <ShaunKing> Hold up.   Full stop.   Stop everything you are doing.   Everything.   And read this interview with Quincy Jones.

961004502030671872 2018-02-06 22:31:42 UTC <ShaunKing> When I started protesting police brutality, almost every white "Christian" I developed relationships with over my 15 years as a pastor unfollowed or even blocked me here on Twitter.   But two actually started loving me more:  @carllentzNYC   &  @bobgoff   Genuinely good men.
961001457578323974 2018-02-06 22:19:36 UTC <ShaunKing> No, really.   @UNLincoln - can you please be more clear on what you are doing?https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/960997522578710528
960997522578710528 2018-02-06 22:03:58 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @UNLincoln,  You are aware that Dan Kleve, one of your students, is a violent white supremacist. In this video he openly says he wants more violence and is waiting for the right opportunity to strike.   Your students want to know why you are so strongly protecting him.pic.twitter.com/JmnQWQCDpP
960993426807410690 2018-02-06 21:47:42 UTC <ShaunKing> What a horrible loss.   I blame so many people for this.   85 year old Joy Noel was wrongly evicted from her New York apartment that she had lived in for over 20 years. She never got the proper notices b/c of a misspelling.   Then she died, homeless.https://bklyner.com/killed-joy-noel/

960878879882825728 2018-02-06 14:12:31 UTC <ShaunKing> This is painfully true. Written by the legendary @WCRhoden -author of Forty Million Dollar Slaves.  The NFL Players Union failed Colin Kaepernick, and in doing so, weakened the position of every player in the league.  When they needed courage, they shrunkhttps://theundefeated.com/features/players-union-boss-demaurice-smith-lost-the-war-against-owners-by-not-fighting-for-kaepernick/
960876398108962816 2018-02-06 14:02:40 UTC <ShaunKing> I got this.   If it was a test, they should've said so. It's ridiculous.https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/960874860430938113

960858883160977408 2018-02-06 12:53:04 UTC <ShaunKing> We live in the time where the President of the United States says congresspeople who refused to clap for him are committing treason.   We also live in the time where the President is so problematic that its easy to move on from him saying such a disturbing thing.
960855105653411842 2018-02-06 12:38:03 UTC <ShaunKing> Oh snap.

This decision, to keep him off of every NFL roster, is rooted in white supremacy.  Its not a football decision.

958565749911642112 2018-01-30 05:00:58 UTC <ShaunKing> Over the past 10 years, Japan, for instance, has averaged ZERO people shot & killed by police PER YEAR.  0.  As in none.   And its not just because Americans have guns. Our police shoot completely unarmed people an average of once per day.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/958562664829145089
958565112012517377 2018-01-30 04:58:26 UTC <ShaunKing> @thatadamguy Japan literally averages ZERO people shot & killed by police per year over the past 10 years.

Thats more than police in most developed nations will kill in a decade. Its more than police in many nations have killed since 1970.   Its January w/ one day to go.  This is not OK.

958556215700844544 2018-01-30 04:23:05 UTC <ShaunKing> LeBron is right. What the Clippers did was dirty. Blake Griffin couldve gone anywhere he wanted this summer and the Clippers told him they wanted him to retire with them.  Now hes in Year 1 of a 5 Year deal with a team he didnt choose.   Its a business, but thats not right.https://twitter.com/espn/status/958465095465652224

957337429895254016 2018-01-27 19:40:04 UTC <ShaunKing> It genuinely seems like almost every public figure who has been called to account for sexual misconduct has been held responsible in some way except one.  Donald Trump.  Decades worth of victims. Hes recorded admitting he does it.   Republicans stand by him.
957336364269350914 2018-01-27 19:35:50 UTC <ShaunKing> Let me say this very clearly...  Conservatives equate whiteness to goodness and even godliness.   Trump takes control of the White House from a Black man and now they think the ethical climate of the nation is better than any point in 8 years - AKA Obamas Presidency.https://twitter.com/williamjordann/status/956916934322348032

957042120463962112 2018-01-26 00:06:37 UTC <ShaunKing> Both of these powerful men have gone out of their way to protect other men who were guilty of sexual assault and misconduct in their specific programs - creating the culture that eventually allowed hundreds of girls to be sexually assaulted.https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/956965853936996352

956720476847472640 2018-01-25 02:48:31 UTC <ShaunKing> The primary operating philosophy of Trump and The White House is white supremacy.   I mean that in the most literal sense.   It's at the core of this bigoted new immigration plan and has been at the core of how Trump (and his father) did business for nearly 100 years.
956717446106374145 2018-01-25 02:36:28 UTC <ShaunKing> Bernie should run. I want him to run.   It has long been my hope that 8-10 amazing people run for the Democratic nomination.   No matter what, Bernie makes the Democratic primary better.

956659111676047360 2018-01-25 22:44:40 UTC <ShaunKing> What is clearer than ever is that a war on drugs in this country never truly existed.   It was always a war on people - a very particular set of people - and drugs were used as the pretense for that war.   That's how you "legalize" weed & weed arrests GO UP for Black folk.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/956644454248706050
956658704379760640 2018-01-25 22:43:03 UTC <ShaunKing> @SouthBeachDad i agree
956652329369030659 2018-01-25 22:17:43 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 13/ End of Thread.   Read my full piece for @TheIntercept now @https://theintercept.com/2018/01/25/marijuana-legalization-weed-drug-arrest/
956652178642493440 2018-01-25 22:17:07 UTC <ShaunKing> 12. In California alone, the weed economy is worth about $7 billion, and its going to grow exponentially.  White people are literally establishing generational wealth off of the industry while millions of Black are still going through the criminal justice system for it.
956651889625632768 2018-01-25 22:15:58 UTC <ShaunKing> 11. While nothing is as awful as the fact that marijuana arrests & prosecutions are done almost exclusively down racial line, what also must be addressed is the extremely gross profits being made in the industry almost exclusively by whites while Black folk are still sent to jail
956650917411131392 2018-01-25 22:12:07 UTC <ShaunKing> 10. In Colorado, which "legalized" recreational marijuana, arrests of white people have plummeted, but arrests of African-Americans and Latinos have actually skyrocketed as much as 50 percent. One has to ask: For whom did Colorado make marijuana legal?
956649697934004224 2018-01-25 22:07:16 UTC <ShaunKing> 9. Over 50 people a day are still being arrested for simple marijuana possession in New York City alone even though the Mayor and others say simple possession is now legal.   It is. For white people.   African Americans & Latinos are arrested daily all over New York for it.
956649221591093254 2018-01-25 22:05:22 UTC <ShaunKing> 8. New York City (Dear @NYCMayor) is an example of a "progressive city" that is truly dropping the ball on marijuana reform while simultaneously bragging that it is nailing it.   Arrests for simple marijuana possession in NYC actually went up by 9 percent from 2015 to 2016.
956648016638865413 2018-01-25 22:00:35 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. In spite of countless studies showing that African-Americans and white people use marijuana at almost the exact same rate, African-Americans are 375 percent more likely to be arrested for it.
956647836065632259 2018-01-25 21:59:52 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. The United States has arrested more people for marijuana possession than every country in the world...COMBINED. It's not even close.
956647663033880579 2018-01-25 21:59:11 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. From 2000 to 2010, an astounding 7,216,000 arrests were made in the U.S. for simple marijuana possession. How many lives were ruined? How many people lost their jobs? Their right to vote? How many of those people lost their college financial aid? How many were jailed?
956647419852263424 2018-01-25 21:58:13 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. An astounding 574,641 people were arrested for simple marijuana possession in the U.S. in 2016 - thats 89 percent of all marijuana-related arrests. These arent dealers, distributors, or kingpins. They are just everyday people with a little bit of weed.
956647181640982528 2018-01-25 21:57:16 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. In 2016, more people were arrested for simple marijuana possession in the United States than all violent crimes combined. More than one person is arrested every minute for marijuana possession in this country.
956646966812905474 2018-01-25 21:56:25 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. So, get this...  Recreational marijuana use is now "legal" in 9 states + DC.   Another 14 states have "decriminalized" recreational marijuana use.  29 states have now legalized varying forms of medical marijuana.  That seems like a lot more progress than it truly is....
956646404843364355 2018-01-25 21:54:11 UTC <ShaunKing> THREAD on the problematic rollout of the "legalization" of marijuana from coast to coast. In short, it's absolutely being done for the economic advancement of white people while the criminalization of everyone else still remains.  The more I dug, the more disturbed I got.
956644454248706050 2018-01-25 21:46:26 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.   In many states where marijuana is now "legal," marijuana related arrests of African Americans & Latinos have actually INCREASED - dramatically in many instances.  What we're seeing is that racism is deeply baked even into these new "reforms."https://theintercept.com/2018/01/25/marijuana-legalization-weed-drug-arrest/
956633977753882624 2018-01-25 21:04:48 UTC <ShaunKing> When asked if Manziel, Kaepernick, and Tebow would be welcomed into the XFL, Vince McMahon said nobody with a criminal record would be allowed, then concluded by saying that meant Tebow would be allowed.  His inference was clear. He suggested Kaepernick was an unwelcome criminal.
956626471036030976 2018-01-25 20:34:58 UTC <ShaunKing> This is at the root of why Vince McMahon is restarting the XFL.   He sees an opening for something more conservative for Trump supporters.https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/956622467442905090

956556494627135495 2018-01-25 15:56:54 UTC <ShaunKing> Police cannot claim they feared for their lives here. And definitely not for all 9 shots. They paused, examined the situation, and fired again.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/956551581809479680
956554159775502337 2018-01-25 15:47:38 UTC <ShaunKing> Their only intention here is murder. Based on the autopsy, even after Bijan was mortally wounded, and police knew this, they paused and continued to shoot him and near point blank range.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/956551581809479680
956552647556902912 2018-01-25 15:41:37 UTC <ShaunKing> This is murder.   These officers should be charged with murder. Not a single cop was in any danger. Every single bullet they fired was completely unnecessary.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/956551581809479680

956187578629226496 2018-01-24 15:30:58 UTC <ShaunKing> I think Republicans are scrambling behind the scenes to figure out how they can prevent Trump from ever meeting with Bob Mueller.   They know full well that it's impossible for Trump to go in there and tell the truth for several hours straight without perjuring himself.

955978933073338374 2018-01-23 01:41:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Just learned that the legendary Wyatt Tee Walker passed away.

955946928944091136 2018-01-23 23:34:43 UTC <ShaunKing> @CNN @FoxNews @ClancyReports Do you sincerely think that our government cares about the mental evaluation of Muslim immigrant "terrorists?"
955945951008616449 2018-01-23 23:30:49 UTC <ShaunKing> Now, for just a moment, instead of it being a white supremacist who threatened to kill the staff @CNN, let's imagine it was a Muslim immigrant from a country on Trump's banned list who made the exact same threats @FoxNews.

955927295549689857 2018-01-23 22:16:42 UTC <ShaunKing> For decades on end this man has made his living talking about personal morality & integrity  This, as far as I know, is the first time he's admitted it's all bullshit. He doesn't really care about it.  He doesn't mind if Trump had affairs w/ a porn star if he delivers on policy.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/955926965898416130
955926965898416130 2018-01-23 22:15:23 UTC <ShaunKing> We're getting to the bottom of things here. I'm being serious.

955888851037380608 2018-01-23 19:43:56 UTC <ShaunKing> But to answer Kyle's question...  They start Black history at the greatest point of exploitation and pain on purpose for many complex reasons - but the driver is that they are abusing history as yet another tool of oppression.   We have to always interrupt this pedagogy.https://twitter.com/kylekuzma/status/952656497644855296
955887985630818305 2018-01-23 19:40:29 UTC <ShaunKing> @zengarden17 Oh I agree, but never start the story during slavery.
955886913633873923 2018-01-23 19:36:14 UTC <ShaunKing> Kyle is spot on here.   My wife is a lifelong educator and suggests two places to start Black history:  1. The beginning. Go back to Africa, thousands of years ago, and work forward.   2. Today. And then work backward.   But nah. You NEVER start with slavery. That's a trick.https://twitter.com/kylekuzma/status/952656497644855296

955589563044581376 2018-01-22 23:54:40 UTC <ShaunKing> At the root of why so many Democrats could sell Dreamers out today is that they don't know them. They haven't spent quality time with them. They don't feel responsible for their futures.   Bernie has a deep heart for these young men and women.https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/955578959802126336
955588193600049152 2018-01-22 23:49:13 UTC <ShaunKing> I wanna be frank here.  I reject people who say Bernie's "no-vote" today was because he's running for President.  No.  Bernie KNOWS DREAMERS PERSONALLY.   They poured their heart out for his campaign. He traveled from coast to coast with him.   This isn't politics. It's personal.https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/955578959802126336

955510833563521025 2018-01-22 18:41:49 UTC <ShaunKing> You see that?  The White House just announced that Trump would not sign the bi-partisan Graham-Durbin bill on DACA.   They literally waited until the Democrats caved then announced they wouldn't do the deal.   Mitch McConnell was never to be believed. SHAMEFUL.
955502287107121153 2018-01-22 18:07:52 UTC <ShaunKing> The majority of Democratic voters are people of color.   This has been the case for two decades now.   But the majority of Democrats continue to fail to represent their voters.
955499831560110085 2018-01-22 17:58:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @People4Bernie EXACTLY.

955498958956257283 2018-01-22 17:54:38 UTC <ShaunKing> @SenatorHassan @paolamendoza She caved.
955497646478757889 2018-01-22 17:49:25 UTC <ShaunKing> Only 15 Democrats held out today.   Blumenthal, Booker, Cortez-Masto, Feinstein, Gillibrand, Harris, Hirono, Leahy, Menendez, Merkley, Murphy, Sanders, Tester, Warren, Wyden  Even 2 Republicans voted no.   This isn't just about "who's running in 2020."   It's about moral courage.

955495864943960064 2018-01-22 17:42:21 UTC <ShaunKing> The lack of moral courage among Democrats today is causing Obama alums to leave the Democratic Party.

955494958689071104 2018-01-22 17:38:45 UTC <ShaunKing> @Bakari_Sellers Bro, shameful stuff today.
955494847925882880 2018-01-22 17:38:18 UTC <ShaunKing> Democrats have learned nothing from these past few years.   Republicans literally stonewalled for nearly A YEAR to block Obama from nominating a Supreme Court nominee.  Democrats caved in 72 hours with 800,000 dreamers at risk.   Democrats lack a backbone. Just shameful.
955494261927108610 2018-01-22 17:35:58 UTC <ShaunKing> This is precisely what Democrats did today.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/955456421100998656
955493955382243329 2018-01-22 17:34:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Some of what we're seeing in the Senate right now is what happens when white people represent 63% of the American population but 90% of the United States Senate.
955492992416018433 2018-01-22 17:30:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Shame on every single Democrat who said they would not do this, but caved and did it anyway.
955492439053258753 2018-01-22 17:28:44 UTC <ShaunKing> Shame on Chuck Schumer.   The deal he just made with Republicans hinges on Mitch McConnell's honesty and integrity.   What a foolish thing they've done.

955456421100998656 2018-01-22 15:05:36 UTC <ShaunKing> DEMOCRATS: You must never make deals with Republicans in which they get YOUR VOTE in exchange for a promise that they will do something down the road.   It's a trick.   We can see it from a mile away.   Maybe you are too close up to see what they are doing.
955455223413248001 2018-01-22 15:00:51 UTC <ShaunKing> If Democrats truly believe Mitch McConnell when he says he "intends to" have the Senate address DACA in February, they are dumber than I thought.   This man is a stone cold liar.   He told Jeff Flake this exact same thing in December, but said he'd address it in January.
955452090066841602 2018-01-22 14:48:24 UTC <ShaunKing> @mrmonnet @CCMSparkster I don't work for the Daily News. And I would've said this when I worked there as well. I regularly spoke up for Palestinian rights while I was there.

955176245687447554 2018-01-21 20:32:17 UTC <ShaunKing> To be clear, the Governor of Missouri strapped a woman up, took pictures of her without her permission, then threatened to release them if she ever said a word about their affair.

955174886019747840 2018-01-21 20:26:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Heres the truth about this government shutdown, from a Republican.

955124376743104513 2018-01-21 17:06:11 UTC <ShaunKing> @brittuniverse @IAmDickGregory @Activist30 Then I must be misunderstanding your original tweet.
955124241854357504 2018-01-21 17:05:39 UTC <ShaunKing> It was just reported that on the first day of the government shutdown, Donald Trump didn't even leave the residence until after 2:30pm.
955122872082665478 2018-01-21 17:00:12 UTC <ShaunKing> @brittuniverse @IAmDickGregory @Activist30 I said she was a leader and your response was "Why, because she gave a speech?" It appears you are unaware of how much she does.
955122704239288320 2018-01-21 16:59:32 UTC <ShaunKing> @brittuniverse @IAmDickGregory @Activist30 No, I am not talking about that. She owns and manages one of the most important production companies for Black folk in the world. She employees and funds so many essential projects. It appears you didn't know that. She is a leader.
955121404525019136 2018-01-21 16:54:22 UTC <ShaunKing> @brittuniverse @IAmDickGregory @Activist30 Which work? Her acting? She does far more than that.

955120563009347586 2018-01-21 16:51:02 UTC <ShaunKing> @brittuniverse @IAmDickGregory @Activist30 You must not know much about her, I suppose.
955120133151821826 2018-01-21 16:49:19 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump's campaign has released a new ad basically saying that DACA recipients & Dreamers are murderers and rapists.  It's the most overtly bigoted ad on immigration I've ever seen.   It's at the root of why the government is shut down right now.
955102256709427201 2018-01-21 15:38:17 UTC <ShaunKing> The man who fancies himself a master deal maker cant make a deal so he wants to change the rules.https://twitter.com/slate/status/955098889371242496
955100386075045889 2018-01-21 15:30:51 UTC <ShaunKing> If you work for Trump, or even support him, after all he has said and done, it should damage your career prospects.  This isnt make believe. Its real life.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/955073747462991872
954871480462053377 2018-01-20 00:21:16 UTC <ShaunKing> Men, its important that you not just respect women, but be led BY them  @TamikaDMallory is my leader.  @msladyjustice1 is my leader  @ErikaAndiola is my leader  @lsarsour is my leader  @RoseAnnDeMoro is my leader  @ninaturner is my leader  I dont just like them, I follow them.
954868104051511297 2018-01-20 00:07:51 UTC <ShaunKing> Viola Davis is a leader.
954867196311851008 2018-01-20 00:04:14 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump hasnt even spoken to a single Democrat today.   Mitch McConnell never even spoke to Chuck Schumer today.   This is on Republicans.
954855331984797698 2018-01-20 23:17:06 UTC <ShaunKing> Kind of cool?https://twitter.com/byrontau/status/954787823990792197
954851955125506049 2018-01-20 23:03:41 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept @bariweiss @natashalennard Good work
954845606543003648 2018-01-20 22:38:27 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump and his core staff are ANTI-GOVERNMENT.  I sincerely dont think they mind this shutdown even a little bit.
954805317933719559 2018-01-20 19:58:21 UTC <ShaunKing> The government has shut down and hes mocking the Womens March on Twitter.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/954788467069870081
954802368679473152 2018-01-20 19:46:38 UTC <ShaunKing> How does the shutdown impact the White House? Wish theyd cut the internet off over there.
954801838460633088 2018-01-20 19:44:32 UTC <ShaunKing> To my folk in Ohio, can you please connect me directly with the family of Joseph Haynes?https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/954008155930988544
954772315690201088 2018-01-20 17:47:13 UTC <ShaunKing> Never in modern American history has the US Government shut down when a single party controlled the House, Senate, and Presidency.   Republicans own this.
954754978098434048 2018-01-20 16:38:19 UTC <ShaunKing> @jalisaambrose I agree. Let's put it all on the table. Do so with compassion, but we have to be honest about it all.

954754484353359872 2018-01-20 16:36:22 UTC <ShaunKing> @jalisaambrose Did I say that? I absolutely agree with you.
954752656337244160 2018-01-20 16:29:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @jalisaambrose I understand his struggles well. His body/kidneys etc. were ravaged by it. I'm not here to judge him or anyone. Members of my own family have died from this.
954750371632697344 2018-01-20 16:20:01 UTC <ShaunKing> Fam.   We have to talk about the rise of drug addiction with our young people.   The commercialization of the recreational use of deadly drugs is just not OK.   Young brothers like Fredo and others are dying from this.   We must be compassionate, but we can't ignore it.

954724248005824513 2018-01-20 14:36:13 UTC <ShaunKing> The man is a liar.   Democrats are not doing this. I know many of us are weary of Trump, but that he is flat out lying about this right now is just despicable.   Last night Democrats were open to extending the budget for a few days, but REPUBLICANS refused.   This is on Trump.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/954722155463430145

954487470724349952 2018-01-19 22:55:21 UTC <ShaunKing> Never forget this. Im pinning this on my page.  A supervising police officer, who was Assistant Chief in Louisville Kentucky told a recruit:  If you catch a Black kid smoking weed, fuck the right thing. Shoot him.  If mom is hot, fuck her.  And more....pic.twitter.com/Qi2nh9jqqX
954483759704879104 2018-01-19 22:40:36 UTC <ShaunKing> I agree. Brilliant piece.  Donald Trump is the freest man in the world.  He lives, lies, speaks, assaults, humiliates, and pays off porn stars from an affair on his 3rd wife who just had a baby...  Without consequence.https://washingtonpost.com/opinions/president-trump-is-the-freest-man-alive/2018/01/18/a8699158-fc8c-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html

954466066100518912 2018-01-19 21:30:17 UTC <ShaunKing> Once white Christians said they were OK with Trump admitting he grabs women by the pussy, nothing else matters.   We are literally finding out he paid a porn star weeks before the election and they dont really care.   But how could they?https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/954444942029611008
954464326047424514 2018-01-19 21:23:23 UTC <ShaunKing> I dont believe most evangelicals will break with Trump. Not now or ever.   I truly believe they value whiteness over integrity, morality, and faith.   Trump is no different today than he was last year or 10 years ago.

953734866557956096 2018-01-17 21:04:46 UTC <ShaunKing> Of all the scandals in 2018, this one is the most underreported.   After calling for surveillance reform, several Democrats broke with the party and voted for it, giving Trump, more power to spy on citizens.

I know you were just appointed to the Judiciary Committee, but today you proved to the world why representation matters.

953326474953715712 2018-01-16 18:01:58 UTC <ShaunKing> Thank you to @CoryBooker for not only calling out bigotry today, but for calling out the silence and complicity of those who were in the room with Trump when he demeaned Haiti and Africa.

953309612727554049 2018-01-16 16:54:57 UTC <ShaunKing> The Director of Homeland Security, under oath, admitted that Donald Trump did say he would like to see more immigrants from Norway instead of Haiti or Africa.  She then said this wasn't racist, but because Trump thinks Europeans are "underrepresented" in the United States.
953309239816138752 2018-01-16 16:53:29 UTC <ShaunKing> @jamieklingler Exactly

953306233053892608 2018-01-16 16:41:32 UTC <ShaunKing> You are the head of Homeland Security and you say you aren't sure if Norway is a predominantly white country?https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/953302079220731904

953304789684772864 2018-01-16 16:35:48 UTC <ShaunKing> I reject this.   This is shameful from the head of Homeland Security.   They are now trying to justify Trump's vulgarity and bigotry by calling it "tough language."https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/953298639291604992
953302845696233472 2018-01-16 16:28:04 UTC <ShaunKing> A Trump supporter on an airline really did heckle 77 year old congressman and civil rights legend John Lewis - yelling "TRUMP" at Lewis as he passed by.

953098139367608320 2018-01-15 02:54:38 UTC <ShaunKing> Not just Trump, but other Republicans are really calling Dick Durbin a liar because Durbin said Trump said Africa & Haiti are shitholes when they think he said shithouses.   I have never heard the word shithouse in my life.   This is ludicrous and wildly disrespectful.
953096507259019265 2018-01-15 02:48:09 UTC <ShaunKing> I kid you not...  Republicans are now saying Trump didnt call them shithole countries, but shithouse countries.

952632801983164416 2018-01-14 20:05:33 UTC <ShaunKing> 22. End of thread.  We must not treat running against Trump like it's a normal thing. He's not normal. How he dominates the news is not normal.   Defeating him will require a different approach. We could perhaps go back to normal down the road.  But we're not there yet.
952632407412396033 2018-01-14 20:03:59 UTC <ShaunKing> 21. I agree with every single argument that "we don't need another celebrity."  But 2020 is not normal. The person does not have to be a celebrity per se, but to defeat Trump, to win back the news cycle, will take very unique factors that only a few people have  It's where we are
952631792800030726 2018-01-14 20:01:33 UTC <ShaunKing> 20. I believe just 3 people have the 4 factors to defeat Trump easily. Others could still win, but these 3 people would crush him.   A. Oprah B. Michelle Obama C. Bernie Sanders  Biden could win. Booker, Harris, Warren, Gillibrand could win  Oprah, Michelle, Bernie would crush it
952630914747691008 2018-01-14 19:58:03 UTC <ShaunKing> 19. In summary, here are the 4 factors needed to defeat Trump.   a. A huge social media following b. A deeply devoted base of support - enough to pack stadiums c. A strong contrast in personality & character to Trump d. Experience with organizing on the national level
952630474349928450 2018-01-14 19:56:18 UTC <ShaunKing> 18. Lastly, the Democratic candidate in 2020 must have a demonstrated history of being able to organize people on the national level.   It would help if they have a real presence in all 50 states and know how to organize and mobilize people in practical ways.
952630084179021824 2018-01-14 19:54:45 UTC <ShaunKing> 17. The Democratic candidate in 2020 MUST contrast with Donald Trump.   They must be a person of impeccable integrity. They must be known for decency and compassion. They must be seen as generous and inspirational. No corruption.
952629613867479040 2018-01-14 19:52:53 UTC <ShaunKing> 16. The 1st factor a candidate needs to defeat Trump is a huge social media following.   The 2nd is the ability to pack a stadium full of people TODAY, without an opening act.  The 3rd factor is this candidate has to pose a STRONG contrast in character/personality to Donald Trump
952629125222723585 2018-01-14 19:50:57 UTC <ShaunKing> 15. Here's what I am looking for?  Can you pack a stadium full of people today? Without Beyonce or Bruce Springsteen opening up for you.   Because it is my belief that if you are not already that popular RIGHT NOW, you can't beat Trump. Period.
952628674163077126 2018-01-14 19:49:09 UTC <ShaunKing> 14. The 1st factor a Democratic candidate will need is a huge social media following.   The 2nd factor that a candidate MUST have is a dedicated, excited core base of supporters that already exists.
952628163380764672 2018-01-14 19:47:07 UTC <ShaunKing> 13. It is my very, very strong belief that without an enormous social media following, Trump's 2020 political opponent will struggle to build momentum against him.  The thing is, very few people in America already have a huge social media following.
952627541046677505 2018-01-14 19:44:39 UTC <ShaunKing> 12. Barack Obama is literally the only leader in America with more social media followers than Trump. He has twice as many, by the way.   He would mop the floor with Trump. He would've stomped him in 2012 and would squash him right now.
952626814249205761 2018-01-14 19:41:46 UTC <ShaunKing> 11. The Democratic candidate in 2020 MUST have an enormous social media following.   Trump had more followers than every . Republican & Democratic candidate COMBINED.  He uses that following to then dominate the news cycle 7 days a week.
952626393132797953 2018-01-14 19:40:05 UTC <ShaunKing> 10. I want to give you FOUR factors that I think Trump's political opponent must have.   Without these four factors, an opponent could still win, but I think they will struggle more than most people want to admit. I'll break each factor down.
952625887542988801 2018-01-14 19:38:05 UTC <ShaunKing> 9. NOTHING makes Trump more formidable than his social media following.  He wields his 46.5 million Twitter followers, 23 million Facebook followers, and 8.2 million Instagram followers to not just dominate and shape every single news cycle, but to mock and ridicule his opponents
952624723468406784 2018-01-14 19:33:27 UTC <ShaunKing> 8. Donald Trump is formidable. People underestimate him at their own peril.   He is the Godzilla of political opponents. Traditional rules and strategies and tactics simply do not work against him.   He lies. He's unethical. He changes positions on the fly.
952624092636737538 2018-01-14 19:30:57 UTC <ShaunKing> 7. Let me preface everything that I am about to say with this:  a. I am not endorsing the people I am about to suggest.  b. I am not proud that our political process has been hijacked by a bigoted billionaire celebrity.  c. I loathe Trump, but we must not be blinded by hate.
952622797842468864 2018-01-14 19:25:48 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. Three different people have now told me that Elizabeth Warren wanted to run in 2016, but that she was discouraged because it was "not her time."  It was Warren's time, actually. She should've run. She might not have won, but she would've been great for the process.
952622279367757824 2018-01-14 19:23:44 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. The 2008 primary was a healthy Democratic primary. A cast of competitive all-stars w/ upstarts like Obama, veterans like Biden, and establishment picks like Hillary. It was super competitive. Debates were strong. It was fierce.   That should be the model for how it's done.
952621865159266304 2018-01-14 19:22:06 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. The 2016 Democratic primary was a worst case scenario for the Democratic Party. This is not a critique of Hillary, but healthy primaries have a competitive cast of 8-10 leading political leaders  Most superdelegates committed to Hillary before the first vote was cast. Bad idea
952621317878177792 2018-01-14 19:19:55 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. The 2020 presidential race will officially begin in 2019. That's next year.   Potential candidates are already forming teams, making faux campaign trips, honing their messages, and testing the waters.   It's important that we be a part of those conversations.
952620772136292354 2018-01-14 19:17:45 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. Anyone telling you that now is not the time to TALK about the 2020 presidential election does not understand how presidential primaries and elections work.   Yes, we must mainly focus on 2018 mid-term elections. Even important 2019 races.   Now is the time to TALK about 2020.

952616269286596608 2018-01-14 18:59:52 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.  I actually believe Donald Trump will be a formidable opponent in 2020 for many very measurable reasons. He won 30 states in 2016.  Here I break down 4 factors I think are necessary to ensure he is defeated.  An uncomfortable conversation.   https://theintercept.com/2018/01/14/2020-election-oprah-trump-michelle-obama-bernie-sanders-joe-biden/

951917163782262786 2018-01-12 20:41:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Conservatives are so loyal to Trump that they refuse to admit or deny he spoke of "shithole countries."

951878772403396608 2018-01-12 18:09:19 UTC <ShaunKing> Ive said this before, but I think Trump sincerely has a clinical obsession with being the center of attention.  Multiple sources are saying hes telling friends he loves the attention hes getting from the shithole countries comment.   Deeply disturbing.

951534869561081857 2018-01-11 19:22:46 UTC <ShaunKing> @PilotFlyingJ Right.   Owner & CEO Jimmy Haslam wants us to believe that the President of his company openly called Black folk niggers in executive meetings, and sang racist songs, but it all took him by great surprise.

951534054234521600 2018-01-11 19:19:31 UTC <ShaunKing> On the left there is Mark Hazelwood.   He was the @PilotFlyingJ executive who called African Americans "greasy niggers" then proceeded to sing a white supremacist song with his sales team, who loved it, sang along, and laughed.   He also stole money from truckers.pic.twitter.com/Xipm0KFHyc

950856837963894786 2018-01-09 22:28:30 UTC <ShaunKing> The Trump administration did not want anyone to know that a heavily armed, violent white supremacist hijacked an Amtrak train and was determined to kill Black people.

950250007558488064 2018-01-07 06:17:11 UTC <ShaunKing> I believe only 5-6 very particular people can defeat Donald Trump - particularly in light of very disturbing systemic problems and horrible fundraising with the Democratic Party.  Will break it down later this week.   Its a small field that can beat him. Hes formidable. Period.

950243763980562432 2018-01-07 05:52:22 UTC <ShaunKing> They would win. I am 100% sure of it.  Its not a feeling, but a science. Ive built a formula on how to beat Trump.   Im not even saying who I prefer, but who has the best chance. This duo would be unbeatable. Period.https://twitter.com/sarahksilverman/status/950203958760525824
950243197707542529 2018-01-07 05:50:07 UTC <ShaunKing> Ill break this down later this week, but the first question we should ask is:  Can this person beat Trump?   I think the traditional rules are off in 2020. Hes a nebulous difficult opponent. He swats most opponents away like bugs.https://twitter.com/popchassid/status/950240199606460417

950239335550521346 2018-01-07 05:34:46 UTC <ShaunKing> @JediofGallifrey Name your top 3 candidates to defeat Trump.
950236215395184641 2018-01-07 05:22:22 UTC <ShaunKing> @loswhit Agreed. He beat 17 Republicans and a Democrat many said couldnt lose. He is formidable. His social media presence alone makes him a Godzilla type of opponent
950224290477215744 2018-01-07 04:34:59 UTC <ShaunKing> @reifman Agreed
950224192217255936 2018-01-07 04:34:36 UTC <ShaunKing> @msshanitarenee Heres the last article I wrote about it. Wrote a few:http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/king-defeat-trump-dems-primary-cast-ages-article-1.3377646
950223998062866432 2018-01-07 04:33:50 UTC <ShaunKing> @msshanitarenee Let me find it. They arent all of my faves, but who I think could actually beat him. I have 5 factors I think are required. Oprah & Michelle each have all 5.
950223665290981376 2018-01-07 04:32:30 UTC <ShaunKing> I have a list of about 15 things my preferred presidential candidate believes in.   They dont have to believe in all 15 to have my support.   They also have to be able to defeat Donald Trump for any of it to matter.   Its a short list.https://twitter.com/alter_eco86/status/950223045242662912
950223236331171840 2018-01-07 04:30:48 UTC <ShaunKing> @alter_eco86 I hear that. What if no candidates support those things?
950222635656413186 2018-01-07 04:28:25 UTC <ShaunKing> A damn mess. She not only shouldve been nominated, she shouldve won. It was her story.https://twitter.com/andreachalupa/status/950215871200456705
950222218889515008 2018-01-07 04:26:45 UTC <ShaunKing> The first thing I want to know about a presidential candidate for 2020 is:  Do they have a strong chance of beating Donald Trump?  He is far more difficult of an opponent than our hatred of him allows. Ive written about this, but think only a few people can beat him. https://twitter.com/kmarxwasright/status/950208203647782912

Even if its horribly negative or dangerous.  2. He actually believes hes a genius. Not faking.  3. These tweets actually confirm the conclusions of mental instability.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/949619270631256064

949306041400995846 2018-01-05 15:46:12 UTC <ShaunKing> Again:  1. Bannon was the CEO of the Trump campaign. 2. Bannon was the FIRST employee Trump hired for the White House.  3. Trump made Bannon the Chief Strategist for the White House. 4. Trump put Bannon on the National Security Council.

949305535475650562 2018-01-05 15:44:11 UTC <ShaunKing> For the rest of our lives, Republicans will be associated with the disaster of Donald Trump. They hitched their wagon to him in spite of widespread awareness of his instability, sexual abuse & harassment, lack of integrity, etc  A year later and it's still shocking they chose him
949302620535091200 2018-01-05 15:32:36 UTC <ShaunKing> VERY TELLING.   Compare the stats of Jimmy Garoppolo's last 6 games for the 49ers to Colin Kaepernick's.

949170321256599553 2018-01-04 06:46:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump now says Steve Bannon has lost his mind and mocks him as sloppy Steve.

948974498149208064 2018-01-04 17:48:46 UTC <ShaunKing> I love it. LOVED the show when I was a kid and love Bruno & Cardi.https://twitter.com/brunomars/status/948778100619337728
948972528625692679 2018-01-04 17:40:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Whoa.   Had to go outside here in Brooklyn. Its brutal out there. Snowing hard but its wind thats crazy. I saw two people get blown down to the ground by the wind. Cars sliding.   Its rough.
948956336900988929 2018-01-04 16:36:36 UTC <ShaunKing> Read Sean's piece. Spot on.https://twitter.com/SeanMcElwee/status/948952877640437760
948956268215128064 2018-01-04 16:36:19 UTC <ShaunKing> @NBCNewsTHINK @SeanMcElwee Absolutely Sean. I was thinking the exact same thing.
948951928410660864 2018-01-04 16:19:05 UTC <ShaunKing> Its good for veterans. Its good for athletes. Its good for so many people.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/948950742995492866
948950742995492866 2018-01-04 16:14:22 UTC <ShaunKing> Today is the day where Democrats should make the full legalization of marijuana a part of the party platform.   Its good for the economy.  Its good for justice reform.  Its good for the opioid crisis.

948927224501202944 2018-01-04 14:40:55 UTC <ShaunKing> Indeed. Because what we are now very clear on is that this country never really waged a war on drugs, it waged a war on people.https://twitter.com/michaelskolnik/status/948924215855665153
948919385648967680 2018-01-04 14:09:46 UTC <ShaunKing> Whats wild about this is Republicans have fought to the death for states rights for generations.  States VOTED to legalize marijuana and now they want federal intervention.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/948918688727617537
948918688727617537 2018-01-04 14:07:00 UTC <ShaunKing> Puny, scared little man. Jeff Sessions is set to announce hes going to fight against states that made weed legal.  I challenge Sessions and conservatives to make this a partisan issue.  They will lose and lose big.  Democrats need to fight back on this.https://www.apnews.com/19f6bfec15a74733b40eaf0ff9162bfa

948659744415338496 2018-01-03 20:58:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Now is the time to organize.
948658888827658240 2018-01-03 20:54:38 UTC <ShaunKing> They are falling apart.https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/948650154151874561
948658579829133312 2018-01-03 20:53:25 UTC <ShaunKing> Fault-lines being drawn.   Ultra conservative here throws Bannon under the bus.https://twitter.com/DLoesch/status/948652910061195264
948641485817335809 2018-01-03 19:45:29 UTC <ShaunKing> Scaramucci back to throwing Steve Bannon under the bus.https://twitter.com/Scaramucci/status/948620044770119681
948641162008637443 2018-01-03 19:44:12 UTC <ShaunKing> And it begins.   You'd be hard-pressed to find two men with less integrity than Donald Trump & Steve Bannon.   This was bound to happen.https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/948638652850061312
948640257649643522 2018-01-03 19:40:36 UTC <ShaunKing> Agreed.https://twitter.com/KatBrezler/status/948526244903211008
948639797320482816 2018-01-03 19:38:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump & Bannon & Scaramucci & Don Jr. are all imploding and attacking each other.   Not one of them is trustworthy, but appears they are now willing to throw the other under the bus to save themselves.   A clusterfuck.   And it matters - because they run our national government.

948609637644988416 2018-01-03 17:38:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Black coaches with winning records are exponentially more likely to be fired than white coaches with winning records.https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidberri/2018/01/02/black-head-coaches-in-the-nfl-are-much-more-likely-to-be-fired-with-a-winning-record/#7149f3af1cb8
948608249057726464 2018-01-03 17:33:25 UTC <ShaunKing> Side by side.  1. Where Trump's first wife said he violently raped her after his scalp reduction surgery.   2. Where Ivanka confirms that scalp reduction surgery to friends.pic.twitter.com/nIT3dSlB9w
948607514437963777 2018-01-03 17:30:30 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump's scalp reduction surgery detailed here by Ivanka is the exact procedure Trump's first wife said (under oath) that he had right before he came home in a fury and proceeded to violent rape and assault her.   http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.htmlpic.twitter.com/zYdhmudOup
948603214332596227 2018-01-03 17:13:25 UTC <ShaunKing> @chrislhayes Congrats to you all.
948589300018446338 2018-01-03 16:18:07 UTC <ShaunKing> You need to listen to this.https://twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/948550163601256448
948587962568192000 2018-01-03 16:12:48 UTC <ShaunKing> The most important thing you can read today is not about Steve Bannon.  It's from the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, James Risen.   Here, James details how the New York Times regularly suppressed his stories at the request of the US Government.https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror/
948545302100955136 2018-01-03 13:23:17 UTC <ShaunKing> Getting ready to be on @democracynow.
948403871331872768 2018-01-02 04:01:18 UTC <ShaunKing> @brianschatz True
948403727928643584 2018-01-02 04:00:43 UTC <ShaunKing> Two things that are true.  1. Trump absolutely writes insulting, outrageous, problematic tweets to distract the nation from many substantive issues.  2. Because he is President of the United States, and not just a TV star, simply ignoring them is not a real option. They matter.
948399625169440773 2018-01-02 03:44:25 UTC <ShaunKing> Dude is straight up doing ads for Fox News. He has no reason to hide it. His party loves it. Nobody there holds him accountable. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/948362512315056129
948306017149911040 2018-01-02 21:32:27 UTC <ShaunKing> @realDonaldTrump brags about no deaths in commercial aviation in 2017 (somehow claiming credit). My friend @MeritLaw immediately reminds him of the black woman who died in flight due in part to violation of federal regs (with no consequences). This man is almost never right.https://twitter.com/meritlaw/status/948304688830730242
948297302359314437 2018-01-02 20:57:50 UTC <ShaunKing> @TheOfficialRocc absolutely
948271085967036418 2018-01-02 19:13:39 UTC <ShaunKing> @Gayelle10 @Molly1Jo @OutstandingWC Not a rumor. I spoke to many about very specific preferences, people, candidates, etc. We felt this type of pressure was very necessary. Not a single Democrat had a Black chief of staff before today. I stand by everything.
948220238360924160 2018-01-02 15:51:36 UTC <ShaunKing> @arneduncan Precisely Arne. It just shouldn't be big news at this point man. Hopefully this is a turning point.
948212205346009088 2018-01-02 15:19:41 UTC <ShaunKing> We are closely watching for the remaining staff announcements from @GDouglasJones. We expect that his staff will look like his voting base.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/948209991659515904
948211243214626816 2018-01-02 15:15:51 UTC <ShaunKing> African Americans literally represent just 1% of the senior staff members hired by Democrats in the Senate.   This hire today should not have to be historic, but it is. It also needs to represent a turning point in how Democrats do business regarding staff hiring.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/948209991659515904
948210518073978881 2018-01-02 15:12:59 UTC <ShaunKing> @HannahDrake628 Waiting on other announcements.
948209991659515904 2018-01-02 15:10:53 UTC <ShaunKing> GREAT NEWS!  Incoming Alabama Senator Doug Jones just became THE ONLY DEMOCRAT in the Senate to hire a Black Chief of Staff. This is the most important position on a Senate Staff.   He is going to officially name Dana Gresham later today.pic.twitter.com/kxApgGtBvV
948207955593388035 2018-01-02 15:02:48 UTC <ShaunKing> @GeeksOfColor I actually dig it. The trailer looks amazing.
948198912199979008 2018-01-02 14:26:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Where someone actually believes the universe is now physically harming Carrie Underwood because she spoke out against Donald Trump.https://twitter.com/Mammagistweetin/status/948023474953572353
948198461442281473 2018-01-02 14:25:04 UTC <ShaunKing> @jbinckes Indeed
948198219628105728 2018-01-02 14:24:06 UTC <ShaunKing> I think it's very important to start all of our organizing, for every cause that we care about, w/ the assumption that Donald Trump is going to be in power.   Republicans will not impeach him. They hitched their wagons to him.  He would never resign under any circumstance. Ever.
948197747395649537 2018-01-02 14:22:14 UTC <ShaunKing> As I look forward into what we can expect in 2018, I think it's very important to start out from this point:  Donald Trump WILL NOT be impeached in 2018. Period.   Republicans would never impeach him and they will control Congress at least until 2019.https://theintercept.com/2018/01/01/2018-progress-erica-garner-midterms-progress/
948184406140903425 2018-01-02 13:29:13 UTC <ShaunKing> I'd like to ask each of them if they had any reservations at all about posing in a cotton field for the Department of Corrections.https://twitter.com/Freeyourmindkid/status/948067339781771264
948176526218014720 2018-01-02 12:57:54 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump is so lame. I know thats an understatement, but its also true.   His schtick is just so damn tired and lame.
948174546573676545 2018-01-02 12:50:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Key.https://twitter.com/jemillerwbal/status/948173767796297728

948160294039314432 2018-01-02 11:53:24 UTC <ShaunKing> This is the new conservative trend. Its happening across the country. They are doing everything they can to take voting rights away and make it more and more difficult to vote. https://twitter.com/ap/status/947618407976972289

948040291008827393 2018-01-01 03:56:33 UTC <ShaunKing> Deeply disturbing.   The US & Israeli governments are dictating to Facebook which accounts of activists they want deleted.  And Facebook is complying - Deleting activist accounts & groups & pages with millions of followershttps://theintercept.com/2017/12/30/facebook-says-it-is-deleting-accounts-at-the-direction-of-the-u-s-and-israeli-governments/
948019667054026754 2018-01-01 02:34:36 UTC <ShaunKing> Just a reminder that Harvey Weinstein told Hillary Clintons campaign to try to find a way to shut Erica Garner up.   I spoke with Erica about this at great length. We were both so disturbed by it.https://theintercept.com/2016/10/07/harvey-weinstein-urged-clinton-campaign-to-silence-sanderss-black-lives-matter-message/
948015909863612419 2018-01-01 02:19:40 UTC <ShaunKing> Wow.   Georgia gets to go back home and play for the National Championship in Atlanta.
947947085600559105 2018-01-01 21:46:11 UTC <ShaunKing> Heres the thing about @RabbiShmuley:  A man who gleefully takes selfies with Steve Bannon has lost all high ground on issues of bigotry in 2018. Bannons not just a bigot, hes a serial abuser of women and claimed Roy Moore was a moral hero.   Shmuley is a mess.pic.twitter.com/NKz13vShoc
947939724408315904 2018-01-01 21:16:56 UTC <ShaunKing> @lorde The truth is @RabbiShmuley has now become a sad tool for conservatives. He hob nobs with actual abusive bigots, like Steve Bannon, then has the gall to call @Lorde a bigot.  You lost your moral standing on bigotry many moons ago.https://twitter.com/rabbishmuley/status/947903067923668992
947938773458964486 2018-01-01 21:13:10 UTC <ShaunKing> Opting out of performing in a place does not make you a bigot.   Shame on you @RabbiShmuley - friend of Bannon.  One can have very legitimate concerns about a place without being reduced in this way.   Just as critiquing Trump or the USA in general does not make me un-patriotic.https://twitter.com/rabbishmuley/status/947903067923668992
947936607440658434 2018-01-01 21:04:33 UTC <ShaunKing> This is Matthew Riehl.   He just shot 5 police officers and killed one of them. Hes white.

947604929182601217 2017-12-31 23:06:35 UTC <ShaunKing> @Islandreamer16 Yep. Several times.
947604669735546880 2017-12-31 23:05:33 UTC <ShaunKing> Bernie was very touched by Erica's support. It mattered to him.   Almost every mainstream Democrat, including ones Bernie had known for decades, bailed. It stung.   In the end, he was left w/ people like @ninaturner, me, Erica, @KillerMike, and @lsarsour.  It was something else.https://twitter.com/pausetheprocess/status/946967199352344577
947603910637826049 2017-12-31 23:02:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Erica was not a random activist being trotted out to represent a candidate she hardly knew. She really believed in Bernie and found herself giving a presidential candidate a real place in her heart, which was no small thing for her.https://twitter.com/pausetheprocess/status/946967199352344577
947603297581633536 2017-12-31 23:00:06 UTC <ShaunKing> If you weren't a part of Bernie's campaign, I've come to really understand that from the outside, the hope we all had was hard to grasp.   Erica believed so much in what was possible. She worked her butt off and truly believed we could change the system.https://twitter.com/pausetheprocess/status/946967199352344577

947377160544772096 2017-12-31 08:01:31 UTC <ShaunKing> @dontkickthekat @Nicshannon21 1. How aware are you of the Justice Dept investigations into police brutality? 2. What statements are you aware of from Obama on the Garner case?
947367348666880000 2017-12-30 07:22:31 UTC <ShaunKing> Painful truth. So many families affected by police violence have told me this exact same thing. Many said they were specifically told by Obama, Lynch, or Holder that theyd get justice or at least make sure the case didnt carry over to Trump.   None got any type of justice.https://twitter.com/es_snipes/status/886969656249942018

947351605736890368 2017-12-30 06:19:58 UTC <ShaunKing> A hard sad day today. Erica Garner should be alive and her family should have some semblance of justice. Instead shes gone and they have no justice.   Im not trying to lie to myself to somehow spin this into anything other than a very horrible, avoidable loss.
947190749082374147 2017-12-30 19:40:47 UTC <ShaunKing> She was Sooooooo proud. https://twitter.com/selenahunn/status/947151125123403777
947163516334731265 2017-12-30 17:52:34 UTC <ShaunKing> It takes a lot of fucking nerve to offer condolences to a family whose lives you made more difficult on a daily basis.   It's unthinkable that Officer Daniel Pantaleo still has a job - 3.5 years years after murdering Eric Garner. It violated multiple policies.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/947157836601184256
947157836601184256 2017-12-30 17:30:00 UTC <ShaunKing> De Blasio and the NYPD fought against justice for the Garner family in every way imaginable.   To this very day, the city is fighting the Garner family in court - refusing to release records from Officer Daniel Pantaleo.

947126520476307456 2017-12-30 15:25:33 UTC <ShaunKing> I love you all.   1. I will keep you posted on how we can help Erica's babies.   2. I will let you know if her funeral is public.   3. I will let you know how we can best fight for justice to continue what she started.
947123621448777728 2017-12-30 15:14:02 UTC <ShaunKing> I'm hurt for Erica because I know that she wanted to live.  She wanted to raise her babies. She wanted to experience more of the world. She wanted to travel & speak more about injustice in America.  And she deeply wanted justice for her father. Shame on this city for denying it.
947121898995019776 2017-12-30 15:07:12 UTC <ShaunKing> Erica ignored respectability politics better than anybody I've ever met.   She spoke truth to power directly to Obama & De Blasio's face.  She NEVER cared who or what was popular or acceptable. She never measured her words for retweets or PR.  She lived her truth every single day
947112573899563009 2017-12-30 14:30:08 UTC <ShaunKing> Our dear sister Erica Garner has just passed away.   When you were her friend, you her friend through all adversity. She was a fierce protector of her friends and family. A truth teller. As genuine and authentic of a soul youll ever encounter.  Were less because of this loss.

944653300733042689 2017-12-23 19:37:52 UTC <ShaunKing> As a matter of principle, politicians should refuse to work with Donald Trump on ANYTHING.  You should not meet with him.  You should not vote for anything he proposes.  He is a well demonstrated bigot.  He is a lifelong abuser of women.  As a rule, you shun, block & oppose him.

943108843923492870 2017-12-19 13:20:45 UTC <ShaunKing> I think Trump has sincere problems of some sort drinking with one hand. He seems to struggle finding his mouth.

941715851396435968 2017-12-15 17:05:29 UTC <ShaunKing> You are correct.

941712388713312257 2017-12-15 16:51:44 UTC <ShaunKing> Feinstein has ONE Black member of her Senior Staff.   Legislative Director, Roscoe Jones, an amazing guy.https://twitter.com/jasonnellis/status/941712153093869568
941711963767353344 2017-12-15 16:50:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Give me the name of your favorite white Democratic senator and I will tell you if they have EVEN ONE Black man or woman on their Senior Staff.   (Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff, Legislative Director, Communications Director)
941710852104904704 2017-12-15 16:45:37 UTC <ShaunKing> No, this isn't me being extra.  Black women (98%) & Black men (93%) voted this man into office.   If @GDouglasJones does like almost every other Senate Democrat has done and appoints an all-white Senior Staff, I have a real problem with him.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/941708824121171970
941710364550582272 2017-12-15 16:43:41 UTC <ShaunKing> This is subtle racism.  NOBODY IN AMERICA is more educated than Black women.  NOBODY IN AMERICA is more prepared, more qualified, has more experience than professional Black women.  This isn't opinion. Studies show this.  Black women don't need qualification. They need open doorshttps://twitter.com/MichelleFix/status/941709556639465473
941709585194389511 2017-12-15 16:40:35 UTC <ShaunKing> @DrJasonJohnson Jason - I'm dead serious bro. He better not pull the same old shit.
941709026064326656 2017-12-15 16:38:22 UTC <ShaunKing> @BrianAGraham42 2 in the Senate. both are Republicans.
941708824121171970 2017-12-15 16:37:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Let me say this publicly to Doug Jones (@GDouglasJones).  You have 4 positions to appoint senior staff.   Chief of Staff Deputy Chief of Staff Communications Director Legislative Director  At least two of them need to be Black.   If not, see what happens.   We're watching.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/941699304300994560
941708217087942656 2017-12-15 16:35:09 UTC <ShaunKing> So here's the deal, Democrats.   If you want what happened with Doug Jones to happen in other places, cut the shit.   Use Black vendors, Black contractors, put Black people in Senior Leadership positions on your staff, and have Black leadership from top to bottom.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/941699304300994560
941707136354127873 2017-12-15 16:30:52 UTC <ShaunKing> In the last measurement, the Democratic Party spent $759 million on contractors.   98% of that was given to white owned firms.   98%.  1.5% to Black owned firms. The remaining 0.5% split between every other ethnic group.   Again, BLACK VOTES, but white power.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/941699304300994560
941706379672326145 2017-12-15 16:27:51 UTC <ShaunKing> It's simply not ok that the Democratic Leadership is as white as it's ever been but Democratic voters are as colorful & diverse as they've ever been.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/941703125811040256
941705537795821568 2017-12-15 16:24:30 UTC <ShaunKing> @realDonaldTrump @mjfree a mess
941705457600811009 2017-12-15 16:24:11 UTC <ShaunKing> Here is the most recent photo of the interns of the Democratic Party.   90% white.   Which is wild because this photo looks NOTHING like the voting base of the Democratic Party.   It looks like the voting base of Roy Moore & Donald Trump.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/922792228183052289
941704880728702978 2017-12-15 16:21:54 UTC <ShaunKing> I literally had to find dictatorships to find a comparable voting bloc as loyal (98%) to a political party as Black women are to the Democratic Party.   Simply put, the Democratic Party survives off of Black votes, but uses those votes to primarily appoint & empower white people.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/941699304300994560
941704122482544641 2017-12-15 16:18:53 UTC <ShaunKing> It took 98% of Black women and 92% of Black men voting for Doug Jones for him to win.   No other voting bloc was even remotely as allegiant.   Comparatively, 79% of white men without a college degree, the most reliable voting bloc for conservatives, voted for Roy Moore.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/941699304300994560
941703469446193153 2017-12-15 16:16:17 UTC <ShaunKing> Every member of the United States Senate gets to chose their Chief of Staff.   Guess how many Black Chiefs of Staff are in the United States Senate?  TWO.  Guess who they work for?  REPUBLICANS.   Democrats in the Senate DON'T HAVE A SINGLE BLACK CHIEF OF STAFF.   Not one.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/941699304300994560
941703125811040256 2017-12-15 16:14:55 UTC <ShaunKing> The United States has ZERO Black Governors.  None.  The United States has ZERO Black State Attorney Generals.  None. Not one.   The Democrats ran two white people for President & Vice President.   The Democratic House leader is white.  The Democratic Senate leader is white.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/941699304300994560
941702607902597120 2017-12-15 16:12:52 UTC <ShaunKing> For decades, white people have chosen the Republican Party. That is to say the majority of whites vote Republican & have since the early the 90s.   African Americans & other communities of color put Democrats in power.  Somehow though, the Democratic Party is as white as ever.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/941699304300994560

941093799119421446 2017-12-13 23:53:41 UTC <ShaunKing> @hannahmosk @gbenaharon This tweet About Nazism was to illustrate that point
941093793432047616 2017-12-13 23:53:39 UTC <ShaunKing> @hannahmosk @gbenaharon Oh I agree. You may have missed my earlier tweet. I said he is a white supremacist. That he openly said slavery was the last time America was great. That he wants to abolish the 13th amendment. And that supporting him makes you a white supremacist.

941072891478716422 2017-12-13 22:30:36 UTC <ShaunKing> If you vote for a Nazi, and you know hes a Nazi, but you vote for him because you like some other stuff he stands for...  You are either:  1. A Nazi.  Or   2. A Nazi sympathizer.   No other options exist.  The same is true for Roy Moore voters. You knew damn well who he was.

941003020275453953 2017-12-13 17:52:57 UTC <ShaunKing> @Cluelessoracle I understand. If a man says America was last great during slavery, and you vote for him - that's a real problem.

940998538418376705 2017-12-13 17:35:09 UTC <ShaunKing> I'm not comfortable w/ the phrase "criminal justice" that has basically become the go-to phrase for an entire space working on issues related to police, prisons, prosecutors, & so much more.  I don't think the word "criminal" is the optimum word there that we should be using.
940998193260752896 2017-12-13 17:33:46 UTC <ShaunKing> @arappeport Have a link? Just want to see it. Thanks
940985967732719616 2017-12-13 16:45:12 UTC <ShaunKing> If you vote for a white supremacist, and it is abundantly clear that he is a white supremacist, that makes you a white supremacist.   Of the 650,000 people who voted for Roy Moore last night, most of them are on white supremacist spectrum.   Period.
940956667335839744 2017-12-13 14:48:46 UTC <ShaunKing> @YesReallyAngel He actually may not have any. We will see.

940952206806867968 2017-12-13 14:31:02 UTC <ShaunKing> @marynorwood you clearly made up your whole campaign message of bringing Atlanta together. A damn mess.

940951220583354368 2017-12-13 14:27:07 UTC <ShaunKing> Now Atlanta's Mary Norwood is taking a page out of Donald Trump's book and completely concocting voter fraud stories. Embarrassing herself & ATL  We always said this was the type of candidate she was, but I hope Atlanta now sees her for who she truly is.http://www.myajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/mayor-reed-demands-mary-norwood-retract-voter-fraud-allegations/qtcMAxhMtlJMIF2j07gCQN/
940950418510811136 2017-12-13 14:23:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Like Roy Moore in Alabama, Atlanta's Mary Norwood refuses to concede. She lost her race for mayor to Keisha Lance Bottoms 8 days ago. The results have been certified.   She still refuses to concede. It's so gross.http://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/elections/mary-norwood-i-have-the-authority-and-ability-to-ask-for-a-recount/85-498639955
940948732341837824 2017-12-13 14:17:14 UTC <ShaunKing> After photos of Trump with many of the women he sexually assaulted emerged, the White House now backtracks and says that when Trump says he had never meant any of them, he just meant a few of them.http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/12/politics/president-donald-trump-fact-check-accusers/index.html
940945516216639489 2017-12-13 14:04:27 UTC <ShaunKing> As Trump repeatedly attacks them, the number of journalists jailed and imprisoned around the world has just hit a record high.   This is a crisis.https://www.rferl.org/a/media-cpj-report-jailed-journalists-historical-high/28913580.html
940944087972306944 2017-12-13 13:58:47 UTC <ShaunKing> @SimonBalto Nah. It's healthy in this culture and climate.
940943024405864449 2017-12-13 13:54:33 UTC <ShaunKing> @SimonBalto He openly spoke against Roy Moore for weeks. My best is no.
940941913057845248 2017-12-13 13:50:08 UTC <ShaunKing> Nothing a loss to give people real clarity.   Republicans now calling Bannon out for who and what he really is.https://twitter.com/NewDay/status/940939427102195713

940939697270022144 2017-12-13 13:41:20 UTC <ShaunKing> As long as Donald Trump is the head of the Republican Party, conservatives will not be able to pivot back to their old (fake) message of morality and decency.  That's done.  I hear a lot of conservatives saying this morning "We need to get back to morality & integrity." Too late
940926619933429761 2017-12-13 12:49:22 UTC <ShaunKing> @GOPChairwoman You funded Roy Moore. That will follow you forever.
940925799900860422 2017-12-13 12:46:06 UTC <ShaunKing> I wondered the same thing. Its real.https://twitter.com/mikefreemannfl/status/940924534676434944
940925652265562112 2017-12-13 12:45:31 UTC <ShaunKing> 650,000 people voted for Roy Moore.  He damn near won.   He said slavery was the last time America was great.   He said Muslims shouldnt be allowed to serve in Congress.   He said homosexuality should be a crime.   Hes accused of being a child molester.   2017.
940921856969859072 2017-12-13 12:30:26 UTC <ShaunKing> Right. The people of Alabama voted against Doug Jones because they loathe Harvey Weinstein.  They say a lot of dumb stuff. This is high on the list.https://twitter.com/existentialfish/status/940901945467908096
940921022240514048 2017-12-13 12:27:07 UTC <ShaunKing> Absolute truthhttps://twitter.com/majorphilebrity/status/940799989978157058
940815539659853827 2017-12-12 05:27:58 UTC <ShaunKing> Tonight was a complete repudiation if Donald Trump.   He won Alabama by 28% last year.  Tonight Roy Moore lost by 2%.   A 30% flip in ONE YEAR is completely unheard of.   Even Trumps lies today about never meeting the women who accused him of sexual assault dug his grave deeper.
940814045434785792 2017-12-12 05:22:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Wrong.  The GOP & Donald Trump backed Roy Moore. That doesnt disappear. Republicans will permanently own this.https://twitter.com/chadpergram/status/940812190709403650
940813759362281472 2017-12-12 05:20:54 UTC <ShaunKing> @jelani9 Me too man. I felt the same way
940813228887674880 2017-12-12 05:18:47 UTC <ShaunKing> This is important.   Mitch McConnell, who my late grandmother in Kentucky despised, just announced that he is going to refuse to seat Doug Jones for a month, until after Republicans vote again on the tax plan.   This is just plain wrong.https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/940797125348208641
940812488043622400 2017-12-12 05:15:51 UTC <ShaunKing> @TheDemocrats @JamilSmith Absolutely.

940808877276360704 2017-12-12 05:01:30 UTC <ShaunKing> Winning feels good right?
940805222540218368 2017-12-12 04:46:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Alabamas Secretary is State (a Republican) just rejected this.   He said:  1. Its not even close to a mandatory recount.  2. Absentee ballots have already been included in current totals.  3. Military votes wont make up the difference.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/940801967928078336
940803945282359296 2017-12-12 04:41:54 UTC <ShaunKing> Charles is right, actually.   Spot on.   Democrats would have now power whatsoever if not for Black folk. Its high time they stop taking Black people for granted with everything from policies to contracts given out for campaigns.https://twitter.com/ac360/status/940802365627817984
940802481180770305 2017-12-12 04:36:05 UTC <ShaunKing> In fact, Doug Jones won by 3x the margin needed for a recount. Period.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/940801967928078336
940801967928078336 2017-12-12 04:34:03 UTC <ShaunKing> I kid you not.  Judge Roy Moore is not going to concede and is calling for a recount.   Hes now down by 20,000 votes which is 1.5%. That is not within the margins for a recount.
940800856173240320 2017-12-12 04:29:38 UTC <ShaunKing> Ive counted at least 25 times where Steve Bannon said in speeches that This election is a referendum on Donald Trump. A vote for Roy Moore is a vote for or against Donald Trump.  OK.

Tonight ladies and gentleman, tonight in this time, in this place, you helped bend the moral arc a little closer to justice...."
940795747515224064 2017-12-12 04:09:20 UTC <ShaunKing> Thousands of you in Alabama checked in with me over the past 24 hours to let me know you are voting for Doug Jones and taking people with you.   Im so proud of you all!!! You made the difference.
940795436440354820 2017-12-12 04:08:05 UTC <ShaunKing> I love yall. A beautiful victory tonight.  Lets use this momentum!!!
940794177662709760 2017-12-12 04:03:05 UTC <ShaunKing> Looking at the numbers and young white people in Alabama rejected Roy Moore even though most of their parents and grandparents didnt.
940793293499232262 2017-12-12 03:59:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Absolutely. Senator Shelby had so much to do with this.https://twitter.com/jelani9/status/940792900216074240

940792207036092416 2017-12-12 03:55:15 UTC <ShaunKing> When its all said and done, Doug Jones is going to win by just about 9,000 votes with 1.2 million votes cast.  EVERY VOTE MATTERS.

940791446998802434 2017-12-12 03:52:14 UTC <ShaunKing> Now that Republicans just lost a Senate seat in Alabama, think of just how outrageous it was for the Republican Party to back Roy Moore.  They had a moment to be ethical and chose otherwise.  This is attached to them forever.
940790142415011840 2017-12-12 03:47:03 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear Alabama,  Thank you!  Youve made us all so incredibly proud tonight. You did the unthinkable.   You organized. You showed up to the polls like crazy! You voted! You won!   What you did today is a historic repudiation of bigotry and the sexual abuse of children.

940735731600945152 2017-12-12 00:10:51 UTC <ShaunKing> I believe Roy Moore being elected is worth a revolt - both economic and political.   He is an anti-gay, anti-Black, Islamophobic, child molester. He is a threat to the safety of millions of people.  The Republican Party made a horrible mistake backing him.
940733914930434050 2017-12-12 00:03:37 UTC <ShaunKing> He has never tried a case before. Thats why.https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/940726368509353984

What I am telling you is that it is worse than we think and it is dangerous for any of us to think otherwise.   I break it all down here....https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/940565489008414720
940568258847150080 2017-12-12 13:05:22 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. Roy Moore literally said Muslims should not be allowed in Congress.   2. He said slavery was the last time America was great.   3. He said abolishing the constitutional amendments after the 10th would solve most of his problems with this country.   AND REPUBLICANS BACK HIM.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/940565489008414720

Except David Duke wasn't endorsed by the President & the Republican Party.

940563470994440192 2017-12-12 12:46:20 UTC <ShaunKing> He is blatantly lying here. It's absolutely despicable. This is the first time he told this lie.  1. Trump openly admitted to forcefully kissing women and "grabbing them by the pussy"  2. Dozens of eyewitnesses can confirm and have already confirmed that he has met these women.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/940554567414091776

940559314875535362 2017-12-12 12:29:50 UTC <ShaunKing> The @NFL should be ashamed of itself.   These horrible complaints of sexual harassment and sexual assault were reported multiple times. They did nothing.https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/940462520585814016
940558578661953536 2017-12-12 12:26:54 UTC <ShaunKing> Oh wow.   I knew Mayor Lee and spoke with him several times about police reform in San Francisco. He was one of the few mayors in America willing to fire a very dangerous police chief. It was too slow and too late, but he did it when others refused.   Life is fragile.https://twitter.com/TwitterMoments/status/940555575229853697

940420751739506690 2017-12-11 03:19:14 UTC <ShaunKing> Baltimore continues to fail to protect witnesses. A hit was ordered from jail on a recorded line. They DID NOTHING AT ALL.https://twitter.com/wbaltv11/status/940354274122383360
940420039932596224 2017-12-11 03:16:24 UTC <ShaunKing> I heard conservatives do it again tonight.  They control the House, Senate, the Presidency, The Supreme Court, most governorships and state legislatures.  Mueller AND Comey are Republicans.  Yet somehow we are expected to believe Republicans are victims?https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/940310227580342272
940406034497179648 2017-12-11 02:20:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Friends,  Lets have hope. I know we live in an increasingly hopeless time and that winning tomorrow in Alabama is a longshot, but Im choosing to believe we can win.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/940342444205527041

940310227580342272 2017-12-11 20:00:03 UTC <ShaunKing> I have to say this:  Robert Mueller and James Comey are LIFELONG REPUBLICANS.  Just heard Hannity and others call them both partisan hacks.  They were appointed by Republicans. They are registered Republicans.
940301412889702400 2017-12-11 19:25:01 UTC <ShaunKing> Veterans everywhere are calling out what the police did to Daniel Shaverhttps://twitter.com/jjgoodman1/status/940270818520530944

940296704137617408 2017-12-11 19:06:18 UTC <ShaunKing> Read this. Bookmark it.   The team @vicenews took nearly a year to conduct this research - some of the most important work out on police violence.   They found that at least TWICE as many people are being shot by police than had ever been reported before.https://news.vice.com/story/shot-by-cops
940272160685346816 2017-12-11 17:28:47 UTC <ShaunKing> I'm told the @Eagles will be signing a quarterback - to serve as a backup to Nick Foles.   My best guess is that he will be a scrub with no playoff experience, few, if any starts or NFL wins. Few of us will have ever heard of him.

940266295672623106 2017-12-11 17:05:28 UTC <ShaunKing> Nearly a dozen combat veterans told me this would be a war crime and could cause an international incident if footage of a soldier doing this overseas was released.   Without fail each veteran found this to be despicable.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/939014159726870530

940249437221408769 2017-12-11 15:58:29 UTC <ShaunKing> A very, very important report on police violence in the United States.   It's twice as bad as any studies have previously reported.https://twitter.com/Cheryllasimpson/status/940241809367855105
940246782457597952 2017-12-11 15:47:56 UTC <ShaunKing> ICYMI.  White man recently planted a hardcore bomb at an American airport.   It didn't go viral. It hardly went local. Conservatives said NOTHING. Did nothing.   BIGOTRY is the primary indicator of their selective outrage.https://theintercept.com/2017/10/11/terrorist-donald-trump-airport-bomber-estes-asheville/
940242763760766977 2017-12-11 15:31:58 UTC <ShaunKing> The moment Trump & Republicans decided to let the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history go by with a wink and a nod, without even a hint of a policy prescription, they lost ALL ability to feign outrage over a failed pipe bomb with no casualties.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/940241118016540672
940242030416056321 2017-12-11 15:29:03 UTC <ShaunKing> EMERGENCY!

940076008106893312 2017-12-10 04:29:20 UTC <ShaunKing> Roy Moore's exact quote was that eliminating all Constitutional Amendments after the 10th would "eliminate many problems."  13th, 14th, 15th address slavery & rights of the formerly enslaved 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/940074425516417026
940074425516417026 2017-12-10 04:23:03 UTC <ShaunKing> My God.  In 2011, Roy Moore literally said he'd like to abolish all of the Constitutional Amendments after the 10th. He then specifically targeted amendments giving rights to the formerly enslaved.  And he is in the lead now in Alabama.

939922437323583489 2017-12-10 18:19:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @BmoreDoc You know I know this bro
939920430139412480 2017-12-10 18:11:08 UTC <ShaunKing> @BmoreDoc I agree. ALL I am saying is that if the people we challenge them with lose, we have to make tough, smart decisions. I dont think bailing out on a race is that
939917594831867904 2017-12-10 17:59:52 UTC <ShaunKing> @BmoreBloc @BmoreDoc I do as well. Why did you vote for Obama? Did you vote for him twice? Unpack that for me in light of your current argument.
939917264048009216 2017-12-10 17:58:33 UTC <ShaunKing> @BmoreDoc You misunderstand me. I have a long history of opposing Neoliberal Democrats. However, when the choice is a conservative Republican or the neoliberal, and all progressive options have been exhausted, I think bailing out is the short-sighted easy route.
939916402038853632 2017-12-10 17:55:07 UTC <ShaunKing> @jaybookmanajc You badly misunderstood me, it appears.
939916156034535424 2017-12-10 17:54:09 UTC <ShaunKing> @KillerMike @TaraLSamples @staceyhopkinsga No, my point was not that progressives bailed on Fort. But that far too many progressive, after he lost, bailed on the race. Thats what my article was about. Bailing out when your preferred candidate does not win.
939915730212085770 2017-12-10 17:52:27 UTC <ShaunKing> @KillerMike @TaraLSamples @staceyhopkinsga Did you DM or email me? I dont see either
939915398794960897 2017-12-10 17:51:08 UTC <ShaunKing> @TaraLSamples @staceyhopkinsga @TheWayWithAnoa I agree. What I am also saying is that accountability works far better with people you know and have capital with. I now know her team well. Much easier to hold a team accountable when you have access
939914734358466561 2017-12-10 17:48:30 UTC <ShaunKing> @TaraLSamples @TheWayWithAnoa @staceyhopkinsga I hear you. Atlanta is my backyard.
939913502847918080 2017-12-10 17:43:36 UTC <ShaunKing> For lunch, Trump often eats 2 Big Macs, 2 fish sandwiches, and a large chocolate shake from McDonalds.   No really.https://twitter.com/theopposition/status/938951627410739201
939911223063310336 2017-12-10 17:34:32 UTC <ShaunKing> @staceyhopkinsga @BmoreDoc I agree. @KillerMike agrees. Weve said this at great length for years/decades even. If Norwood had been elected I assure you it would have been worse.
939910861975515136 2017-12-10 17:33:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @TaraLSamples @staceyhopkinsga And my article was about how progressives, when we lose, often for running very bad campaigns, make a real mistake to bail out. And that bailing gives us less political power. @KillerMike & I both backed Fort, but decided bailing was not a viable option.
939910447796539392 2017-12-10 17:31:28 UTC <ShaunKing> @TaraLSamples @staceyhopkinsga My article was about Fort. And how when he did not win, a true conundrum existed for progressives. I campaigned for him. When he lost, many progressives bailed, and then publicly criticized me for not bailing. I think that is dangerous.
939909898736939008 2017-12-10 17:29:17 UTC <ShaunKing> @TaraLSamples @staceyhopkinsga My greater point is this: Fight for the most progressive candidate available from start to finish. Once Fort lost, and it became a runoff, it was my very strong opinion that Bottoms was the better option. We ignore better options at our own peril
939909621841526785 2017-12-10 17:28:11 UTC <ShaunKing> @TaraLSamples @staceyhopkinsga I agree with every single word both of you have said. A more progressive candidate was available. He got blown out. No matter how we paint her, Mary Norwood was not/ is not more progressive than Bottoms. @MeritLaw & I both had negative experiences with Norwood.
939909109360549891 2017-12-10 17:26:08 UTC <ShaunKing> @TaraLSamples @staceyhopkinsga You dont think Vincent Fort is a progressive? I do. He came in 5th place. That was our time to show up. He got 9,000 votes.
939889033001480192 2017-12-10 16:06:22 UTC <ShaunKing> @TaraLSamples @staceyhopkinsga Hey Stacey. Did you read my piece? I'm not blaming progressives for the Atlanta race, but using the stuff "progressives" said to me directly to highlight an important problem. I hope you will check it out.
939884990686363648 2017-12-10 15:50:18 UTC <ShaunKing> @sierrapett Take a few minutes out of your day and watch this short film on how bigoted whites desecrated a 350 million year old mountain to create the largest monument to hate in the world.

939882474775154690 2017-12-10 15:40:18 UTC <ShaunKing> I'm grateful that @Peter_Wehner, a lifelong Republican and evangelical Christian who served 3 different Republican administrations - wrote this.   Some may say "it's too little, too late," and I understand that conclusion, but it's not. This shift never comes easy.https://twitter.com/Peter_Wehner/status/939643434528370688
939876967763136512 2017-12-10 15:18:25 UTC <ShaunKing> I agree with him. The moment Trump became the face of the Republican Party, ETHICS were thrown out the door for Republicanshttps://twitter.com/thisweekabc/status/939861171980529666
939876331164176384 2017-12-10 15:15:54 UTC <ShaunKing> White progressives must sincerely investigate/interrogate/confront their own white privilege. I say this with love.   Because they have huge hearts for good, they are regularly blind to how their own white privilege functions. Its a problem.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/939874888092999681
939874888092999681 2017-12-10 15:10:10 UTC <ShaunKing> Progressives.  I share every position you do from Medicare For All, on down.  If you say you wont vote for Doug Jones in Alabama because he he doesnt support 82 out of 82 of your positions, thats dumb AND privileged.   Rethink that.https://theintercept.com/2017/12/07/atlanta-mayor-bottoms-progressives/

939336504354181120 2017-12-08 03:30:49 UTC <ShaunKing> At first I thought it was an urban legend, but Officer Philip Brailsford really did have the words Youre Fucked etched into the steel of the AR-15 assault rifle that he used to murder Daniel Shaver.   The jury did not know this.   https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/mesa/2017/11/30/brailsford-ex-mesa-officer-charged-murder-says-he-would-take-same-action/910369001/pic.twitter.com/3reShDKzCx

I choose to vote for the most progressive person available

938891483603750912 2017-12-07 22:02:28 UTC <ShaunKing> She ran on a fake platform of uniting Atlanta.

938891007055327234 2017-12-07 22:00:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Utterly shameful.   This is exactly what we expected from Mary Norwood.

938826937052606464 2017-12-07 17:45:59 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. A way exists for thoughtful politicians to sincerely address the economic concerns of poor whites, in a very serious way, without sacrificing the emergency of bigotry and racism in America.   Its a political tightrope. But it must be walked.https://twitter.com/vice/status/938442101943160832
938826190529486854 2017-12-07 17:43:01 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. Bernies public language on Trump supporters drastically downplays their racist, bigoted, whites supremacist, nationalist motivations.   I believe its primary for Trumps voters. Bernie believes its secondary.   Final thought...https://twitter.com/vice/status/938442101943160832
938825268260753408 2017-12-07 17:39:21 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. Like Bernie, Ive traveled all over the country these past few years.   Millions of Trump voters are indeed poor white people who are struggling. Many are former Democrats who feel abandoned by the party in the most basic ways.   Many fell for Trumps lies.

938824580491292673 2017-12-07 17:36:37 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. This is a blind spot for Bernie. As a staunch supporter of his, its painful for me to watch.  It has a shadow of truth. But I believe he wants it to be true more than it actually is.   Let me explain.https://twitter.com/vice/status/938442101943160832
938822203411521536 2017-12-07 17:27:10 UTC <ShaunKing> @KyleKulinski I agree. Never stop fighting.
938807120132214784 2017-12-07 16:27:14 UTC <ShaunKing> @KyleKulinski This thought supposes that having conservatives in office does not cause severe damage to very real people.

938789204611534848 2017-12-07 15:16:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Fight for your preferred political progressive candidate until the bitter end.  But if your preferred progressive loses, throwing the whole election away is not principled, it's immature, short-sighted, and could be genuinely dangerous for people.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/938786971895369728
938788184988770304 2017-12-07 15:11:59 UTC <ShaunKing> @johniadarola Fight for your preferred progressive candidate until the bitter end. I will always do this, but when/if they lose, smart, tough choices have to be made.
938787717109993472 2017-12-07 15:10:08 UTC <ShaunKing> It's far too easy for many privileged white progressives to set an entire election ablaze after their preferred candidate loses.  They often aren't the ones who will suffer the most from the consequences of such actions.  It's not principled. It's short-sighted and dangerous.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/938786971895369728
938786971895369728 2017-12-07 15:07:10 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.  How far too many progressives are hating good political leaders because they aren't perfect, or ideologically pure.

938490659476000769 2017-12-06 19:29:44 UTC <ShaunKing> I am no @MittRomney apologist, but I just heard what Steve Bannon said about Mitt and his family yesterday at the Roy Moore rally.  It was horrible, and rooted in a bigoted attack on Mitts faith. Bannon sounded like a raving madman.   Hes a horrible human being.

938429238717411330 2017-12-06 15:25:40 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. Most undocumented people do not get here by crossing the border on foot. They fly in and just don't return to their country of origin.   2.

938414850845433857 2017-12-06 14:28:30 UTC <ShaunKing> The life-altering violence and carnage caused by the @NFL has caused those who weren't boycotting to think twice about watching the game.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/05/steelers-bengals-game-violence-ryan-shazier-nfl
938413311170940928 2017-12-06 14:22:22 UTC <ShaunKing> An intern literally had to get out of the car and RUN from John Conyers.

938407964460965889 2017-12-06 14:01:08 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump and the Republican Party are responsible for this.

937786427139592195 2017-12-04 20:51:22 UTC <ShaunKing> To be clear, Trump has NO PROBLEM eliminating monuments.   Strange how vehemently he defended Confederate monuments and how easily he wiped out Native American oneshttps://twitter.com/ap_politics/status/937768782378029057
937774663438159872 2017-12-04 20:04:37 UTC <ShaunKing> Nobody cares with all thats going on, but Donald Trump is a TERRIBLE public speaker.   Hes genuinely hard to listen to.   Content aside, his monotone delivery and struggles reading his speeches are some of the worst of any public leader
937764157461581825 2017-12-04 19:22:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Because the line separating 1957 from 2017 is just not that big.   It's 2017 and local newspapers in Alabama are afraid of bullets in their window for endorsing Doug Jones.https://twitter.com/MrDanZak/status/937671795477499905

936950454642266112 2017-12-02 13:29:30 UTC <ShaunKing> Republicans are playing by a very different set of rules.

936694828599009281 2017-12-01 20:33:44 UTC <ShaunKing> Republicans are really pretending like Trump's National Security Advisor did not just take a plea on a federal case and agree to flip on other people.   It's like it never even happened.

Secondly, I have repeatedly said we must focus both on Russia and other serious issues. Hell, I've been criticized for saying so.
936678097772040195 2017-12-01 19:27:15 UTC <ShaunKing> We just crossed 1,100 people killed by American Police in 2017.  Outside of wars, most peer nations of the world have not had 1,100 people killed by police in the entire documented history of their country.   Several countries have not had a single person killed by police in 2017

936651440315092993 2017-12-01 17:41:20 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump can't help himself. This tweet from 2016 is at the root of Flynn's indictment.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/814919370711461890
936645029438910464 2017-12-01 17:15:51 UTC <ShaunKing> From May.  This is hyper-relevant right now.  It was Flynn that Trump asked Comey to go easy on.

936606566119337984 2017-12-01 14:43:01 UTC <ShaunKing> Justin is spot on.  Trumps whole persona is that he runs a tight ship and nothing gets past him.  Now his campaign manager and National Security Advisor have been charged criminally.https://twitter.com/juscohen/status/936603580601192449

936602676300836864 2017-12-01 14:27:33 UTC <ShaunKing> Now Donald Trump's National Security Advisor and Campaign Manager have been charged criminally.
936601969405329409 2017-12-01 14:24:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Everything Trump has said and done over the past week should be viewed in light of this guilty plea from Michael Flynn.   Trump is in a panic.
936593629849833472 2017-12-01 13:51:37 UTC <ShaunKing> Again, Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the Presidency.   Quit blaming your failures on anyone other than yourself and your party.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/936555753946705920

936368287511994372 2017-11-30 22:56:11 UTC <ShaunKing> This excuse from @Twitter is shockingly bad. They openly admit that Trump is violating their rules, but say that they are allowing it so that both sides can be seen.https://twitter.com/cnni/status/936298944958787585

936330650273177600 2017-11-30 20:26:37 UTC <ShaunKing> The two men who got sent to prison for 15 years on planted drugs just got released.

936328793094017029 2017-11-30 20:19:15 UTC <ShaunKing> THIS IS HUGE  A @BaltimorePolice Officer planted drugs on 2 men. The 2 men got sent to prison for 15 years.

Officer Sean Suiter - who was mysteriously murdered this month before testifyinghttp://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-burley-gttf-suiter-20171130-story.html
936305623876165634 2017-11-30 18:47:11 UTC <ShaunKing> It is peculiar to see Paul Ryan call for John Conyers to resign when he never made this call for Donald Trump under the exact same circumstances.

935912536804864000 2017-11-29 16:45:11 UTC <ShaunKing> @piersmorgan That's what stumps me man. Any leader who called for a Muslim ban, then defended it, even initially saying American citizens studying abroad should be banned from re-entering, would also do what we've seen today.   I say this with respect, but think you missed warning signs.
935910408543703041 2017-11-29 16:36:44 UTC <ShaunKing> @piersmorgan I wonder how much time you spent between 2014-2016 reading or studying what came from Bannon & Breitbart. When Trump made Bannon his right hand man in the campaign and White House, and Stephen Miller his Chief Policy Director - this stuff should've been clear to you.
935909655787778048 2017-11-29 16:33:44 UTC <ShaunKing> @piersmorgan I appreciate your reply. It makes me wonder, though, just how closely you followed Trump's campaign and if you viewed it all through the lens of a friend.   I kindly ask that you reconsider his first announcement and defense of the Muslim ban.   So many warning signs Piers.

935896179078033409 2017-11-29 15:40:11 UTC <ShaunKing> I translated this Dutch article.

It can't be undone. Trump would never apologize, but if he did, it's not enough.  Every leader and person of influence must denounce what he did today
935894616548757504 2017-11-29 15:33:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @Twitter,  By allowing Donald Trump to use his massive presence on here to share anti-Muslim hate videos, created by a convicted hate-monger, you are endangering millions of people.   You must stop this.

935851996703346688 2017-11-29 12:44:37 UTC <ShaunKing> Let me make it plain for you.   This man is a lifelong bigot. He works for the madman Alex Jones. He has attacked me for years.   Even HE is surprised at what Donald Trump has done this morning by retweeting these anti-Muslim videos.pic.twitter.com/lJhOHGii5M
935850921992519680 2017-11-29 12:40:21 UTC <ShaunKing> @KeishaBottoms So which is the truth? The truth is, @marynorwoods endorsement list as of late has started to look a lot like a whos who of the I have a longstanding vendetta against the current Mayor club.  Dont be distracted by parlor trick politics.    #StayWoke
935850814534496256 2017-11-29 12:39:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Shirley Franklin endorsed @marynorwood yesterday in the mayoral run-off against @KeishaBottoms. Shes also said Norwood has "has not demonstrated vision, competence or integrity in her public life."  #atlpol #gapol #ATLMayor
935850585349410816 2017-11-29 12:39:01 UTC <ShaunKing> I don't endorse Piers, but I want you to see this tweet from him to understand just how problematic Donald Trump is right now.https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/935842887480369152
935849545564553217 2017-11-29 12:34:53 UTC <ShaunKing> I don't think our nation understands how dangerous Trump's tweets from this morning are.   He is literally retweeting random anti-Muslim videos from one of the most bigoted groups in all of Britain. It's absolutely disgusting.

935246659373674496 2017-11-27 20:39:14 UTC <ShaunKing> I've said it many, many times, but shame on this nation for voting Donald Trump into office. It's a daily clusterfuck of offensive bigotry and downright incompetence.   It's outrageous that he even ran. Even more ridiculous that he won.
935234402325581824 2017-11-27 19:50:31 UTC <ShaunKing> Unreal. After a decade of complaining about deficits, making the deficit a primary talking and campaigning point, the new Trump tax plan, according to the CBO...  INCREASES the deficit by $1.4 TRILLION. They have no principles or core beliefs. Phony.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-tax-plan-cbo-estimates-deficit-would-increase-by-1-4t-over-next-decade/

933427950631948290 2017-11-22 20:12:20 UTC <ShaunKing> @RepJoeBarton @songadaymann That's possible.
933427840929890305 2017-11-22 20:11:54 UTC <ShaunKing> Let's be honest.   The new Republican brand, which starts with Donald Trump, is infidelity, pedophilia, and widespread, unchecked sexual misconduct.   While Barack Obama has spent his life in a dedicated marriage to one woman, they attack him and celebrate lifelong philanderers.

They said it was common knowledge that he was to be avoided.  Parents told their children.

932874568980680704 2017-11-20 07:33:23 UTC <ShaunKing> @RepJohnConyers @STEPHMHAMILL Good. Let's start there. Do you also feel this way about Donald Trump - since he has many more accusers and was recorded openly admitting to sexual assault? I ask sincerely.
932844698150035456 2017-11-20 05:34:42 UTC <ShaunKing> @SaraGonzalesTX Oh but he is. On taxes, on immigration. On LGBT issues. On the environment. On issues of wealth. On unions. On judicial appointments. On anti-Obama-isms. He is yours. I respect that you dont like him, but he is uniquely and only yours.

932812289488670720 2017-11-20 03:25:55 UTC <ShaunKing> @RealMichaelKay For very similar reasons why people interview Donald Trump. Have you seen a Donald Trump interview?
932810909235499008 2017-11-20 03:20:26 UTC <ShaunKing> It is fundamentally outrageous that the federal government has kept secret 264 financial settlements against government employees - including those of sexual harassment.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/932810349601964032

932809762739236869 2017-11-20 03:15:52 UTC <ShaunKing> @loumoore12 For many of the same reasons that Trump is hard to win an argument with. They don't use any rules or logic or even basic truthfulness.
932809224664559617 2017-11-20 03:13:44 UTC <ShaunKing> Does the @NBA have a concussion protocol that I can read?   Everybody seemed 100% sure Anthony Davis had his 3rd concussion, then they changed the diagnosis days later and he's playing again tonight.
932808284037419008 2017-11-20 03:10:00 UTC <ShaunKing> @BariAWilliams Indeed.
932756285405134854 2017-11-20 23:43:22 UTC <ShaunKing> As man after man gets suspended, fired, and booted for their long histories of sexual harassment and assault, the justification for Donald Trump remaining in office another day is a mystery.   The list of professions with a higher standard than the White House is long.
932738190615764993 2017-11-20 22:31:28 UTC <ShaunKing> It absolutely is.   One of the key features of all forms of privilege is a level of ignorance to how it functions in society. We must all make it our business to do better.https://twitter.com/jameskerti/status/932735413768220674

932737031431696385 2017-11-20 22:26:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Anyway, I have a huge heart for victims.   At the age of 15 I was so severely beaten that I missed 2 years of high school recovering from the injuries and surgeries. Changed me.  I will stand with each of you, through thick and thin, in whatever ways I can.   Your friend,  Shaun
932736352784928769 2017-11-20 22:24:10 UTC <ShaunKing> Let me say a few things, then I'll keep listening to, believing, and amplifying women.   1. I have pledged to always call out any sexual harassment I see or even hear of.   2. Wife & I have pledged to not "love our son & raise our daughters." We're teaching him hard lessons.
932735838831677440 2017-11-20 22:22:08 UTC <ShaunKing> At 15 & 18, this nasty society has already conditioned my teenage daughters to endure the abuse of casual sexual harassment, and keep on moving - on the train, on the sidewalk, out and about.   THEN - when they enter the workplace eventually, I can see how'd they'd stay silent.
932735494626127872 2017-11-20 22:20:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Over the past month or so, as I've seen so many brave people come forward to report sexual harassment and abuse, I thought of something my wife & teenage daughters experienced.   Society conditions girls/women to encounter sexual harassment & just accept it as par for the course.
932735137611243520 2017-11-20 22:19:20 UTC <ShaunKing> My oldest 2 daughters (I have 4) are 15 & 18 years old. In New York, teenagers are out and about on their own daily.   Damn near every day my girls deal with the nastiness of men. Never when I'm with them, of course, but ALL THE TIME when they are out on their own.
932734711864193027 2017-11-20 22:17:39 UTC <ShaunKing> I'm 38. I've with my wife for 22 years.  For all 22 years since I've known her, she's had to deal with the ugly harassment of men in public. Catcalls, sexual harassment from strangers, creepy comments, etc.   In New York it's fucking terrible. Every day all day....
932734251245756421 2017-11-20 22:15:49 UTC <ShaunKing> What I am about to say is not a "I have daughters" comment.   But having 2 teenage daughters and being married to wife that I speak with all day every day, prepped me for what we're seeing now with awful men being outed everywhere.  I'm not sure I'd know otherwise.   //Thread
932732701873930241 2017-11-20 22:09:40 UTC <ShaunKing> Over and over again, we hear from women who've been driven out of their dream jobs and industries by horrible predatory men.

932732375628484608 2017-11-20 22:08:22 UTC <ShaunKing> QUESTION: Does a universal 3rd party phone number or reporting system exist where people can safely report incidents of sexual harassment?   It's needed. Over & over again we hear victims describe the feeling of not having anyone or any clear mechanism to report incidents to.
932730733436854272 2017-11-20 22:01:50 UTC <ShaunKing> WTF?  I am a man and I am pretty much at the point where I think men are terrible creatures.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/932726811699613696

The Republican Party is embroiled in scandal from top to bottom.  So Trump is inciting his racist base to anger against Black teens, Black dads, and Black athletes.
932591615037837313 2017-11-20 12:49:02 UTC <ShaunKing> If you are struggling to understand why Trump has criticized LaVar Ball & Marshawn Lynch more than Roy Moore, its because conservatives have made it very clear that a white Republican pedophile bothers them far less than a Free Black Man.

932332514080903169 2017-11-19 19:39:27 UTC <ShaunKing> Maybe this is why he's tweeting about LaVar:  @realDonaldTrump's Oklahoma Campaign Chair just agreed to plead guilty to the sex trafficking of young boys.http://newsok.com/former-oklahoma-state-senator-has-agreed-to-plead-guilty-to-a-child-sex-trafficking-offense/article/5572707
932326269768826885 2017-11-19 19:14:39 UTC <ShaunKing> Did you know that in 1950, the famous songwriter Woody Guthrie wrote a lyric about @realDonaldTrump's father, Fred, saying that he stirs up RACIST HATE for profit.   I kid you not. OLD RACISTS.   Here's the lyric.  Here's the background on the song: https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/25/woody-guthrie-sang-of-his-contempt-for-his-landlord-donald-trumps-father/pic.twitter.com/rmf43nQt5w
932323472767967232 2017-11-19 19:03:32 UTC <ShaunKing> @realDonaldTrump 7 people were arrested at the KKK rally - including Fred Trump.   This clipping from the Long Island Daily Press, June 2, 1927 states that ALL SEVEN who were arrested were KKK members who each had on KKK hoods and robes.   Fred Trump was a member of the KKK.pic.twitter.com/TmGR2r0wIn
932322382248923137 2017-11-19 18:59:12 UTC <ShaunKing> So, @realDonaldTrump denied that his father ever lived at the address listed when Fred Trump was arrested at the KKK rally, but Fred Trump himself listed the address announcing his marriage to Trump's mother.pic.twitter.com/R3fdOhUbJC

932320665834852355 2017-11-19 18:52:23 UTC <ShaunKing> @packers This is why active players for the @Packers told me they were upset that the team did not attempt to sign Colin Kaepernick.   He had 16 TDs & only 4 interceptions all year last year.   These teams aren't giving their players the best chance to win. https://twitter.com/Sp0rtsTaIkJ0e/status/932314490833702913
932319648779001857 2017-11-19 18:48:20 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump thrives off of making enemies that his base hates. It keeps his hero status among his core supporters.   This is why he targets Colin Kaepernick and LaVar Ball.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/932319189108494341
932319189108494341 2017-11-19 18:46:30 UTC <ShaunKing> If you could develop a prototype of a Black man who gets under white folk's skin it would be LaVar Ball.
932317593561714693 2017-11-19 18:40:10 UTC <ShaunKing> No Black man irritates a white man more than one who did not ask their permission or seek their blessing for the power they now have.   Add on top of that a free Black man who says whatever the hell he wants to say.  White men have hated LaVar Ball since his name was Jack Johnsonhttps://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/932314022522826752

932315743227609088 2017-11-19 18:32:49 UTC <ShaunKing> Speak of fathers...  @realDonaldTrump your father was arrested at KKK riot. And he wasn't an anti-protestor. He was a Klansman.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/28/in-1927-donald-trumps-father-was-arrested-after-a-klan-riot-in-queens/?utm_term=.fd7382e97468

932314022522826752 2017-11-19 18:25:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Few things irritate white men, particularly white men whose power is centered in their whiteness, than a fully free Black man who doesn't kiss their ass on demand.

932309626489659397 2017-11-19 18:08:31 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. The man is outrageously desperate for attention & gratitude.  2. People close to this say Trump had very little to do with the situation. Instead it was tech CEO's & college execs.   3. They weren't in jail.  4. He thinks people should be jailed for personal insults.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/932303108146892801

932018405263192065 2017-11-18 22:51:18 UTC <ShaunKing> Jon is right.   Much of the deepest police corruption and violence happens in cities that are owned from top to bottom by Democrats.   It's despicable.https://twitter.com/jon_naz/status/932014114246885376

932002206370418689 2017-11-18 21:46:56 UTC <ShaunKing> @joelmsiegel It is infuriating. And short-sighted. I truly believe New York would embrace someone who said, "This is on me. Let's fix it. It's going to be hard, but we can do this. Let's get to work." And then made it all public

931966793693921280 2017-11-18 19:26:13 UTC <ShaunKing> Listen.   The train service in New York is HORRIBLE. It took my son and I 90 minutes to make a 30 minute trip. We left early and were still 30 minutes late.  Trains closed everywhere. Everybody was confused as hell.   It doesnt need to be this way.

931194856373923840 2017-11-16 16:18:49 UTC <ShaunKing> Several congresswomen have already come forward over the past few weeks to speak about the horrible culture of sexual harassment from their fellow congressmen.   I think what happened with Al Franken will cause more to speak out and name names.
931191092757843968 2017-11-16 16:03:51 UTC <ShaunKing> I am still stuck at how clearly @IvankaTrump expressed how she believes the victims of Roy Moore but not the victims of her own father.   It's wild.

931189759598264321 2017-11-16 15:58:34 UTC <ShaunKing> This is not getting enough play.   Where Breitbart's Steve Bannon openly says that Jeff Sessions is his mentor and describes how close they are.   Think of the implications of that.pic.twitter.com/rRI9pzm1VV
931186444550492161 2017-11-16 15:45:23 UTC <ShaunKing> You have to see this video.   All over the country Steve Bannon's primary description of Judge Roy Moore was as a "good and righteous" man.

931182027264716803 2017-11-16 15:27:50 UTC <ShaunKing> No, this was not a skit. She asleep when this happened. Another incident happened during a skit.

931149754993664001 2017-11-16 13:19:36 UTC <ShaunKing> Just looked again at Embiids stats from last night. It was a historic night.   @FisolaNYDN just said no NBA player has put up those numbers since 1973.  46 points (14/20 & 2/3 from 3) 15 rebounds 7 blocks 7 assists

931036099614474240 2017-11-15 05:47:58 UTC <ShaunKing> @Krisplashed Absolutely
931035885738577920 2017-11-15 05:47:07 UTC <ShaunKing> Wow. A career night.  Embiid is great and a ton of fun to watch. The man is excellent.
931035035972579329 2017-11-15 05:43:45 UTC <ShaunKing> The Lakers & Sixers are proof that the best way to rebuild your team is through the smart use of draft picks.
931034376586055680 2017-11-15 05:41:07 UTC <ShaunKing> @Myron723 @RMout29 Same here. From the jump he was solid. Hes doing just what he did in the summer league against the big dogs too.
931034118162395137 2017-11-15 05:40:06 UTC <ShaunKing> My God this is so sweet.  Almost cried watching this. In a world full of mean spirited people, this is special.https://twitter.com/ghorbanisadegh/status/930886547636924422

931029322512683008 2017-11-15 05:21:02 UTC <ShaunKing> It is increasingly clear that Roy Moore is a pedophile who stalked and preyed on and tracked down young girls all over Alabama.   At school, in court, in shopping malls, at YMCAs, EVERYWHERE.  He is a disgusting human being.

931025588034457600 2017-11-15 05:06:12 UTC <ShaunKing> @edwardgorelik @DMooreNFL They are 5-4 and he was benched for a 5th round rookie. Taylor is in the top 10 in completion %, #1 in interception rate. Youd struggle to find a comparable white QB benched for a 5th round rookie.
931025155970695168 2017-11-15 05:04:29 UTC <ShaunKing> @DMooreNFL Again, read this and get back with me. Im not saying the Bills said hey, Tyrod is Black, lets bench him. Dont be obtuse. Im saying the NFL has a long trend on this. Its disturbinghttps://twitter.com/chuckmodi1/status/930814533802881024
931024676201160705 2017-11-15 05:02:35 UTC <ShaunKing> @PopChassid @acandidworld @EgSophie @kyjlue Also, I can only speak for myself, but I absolutely agree with your critique of the left. I have the same critique of racism and bigotry on the left. I agree. Still, Linda is not antisemitic. Thats my primary point.
931024288534220800 2017-11-15 05:01:02 UTC <ShaunKing> @PopChassid @acandidworld @EgSophie @kyjlue A few thoughts. My dismissal was of few words, but it was not reflexive. Never that. Ive considered this extensively and read half a dozen articles on this, spoken to people, and my conclusion is the same. Shes not antisemitic.
931023520569679872 2017-11-15 04:57:59 UTC <ShaunKing> @DMooreNFL Read this:https://twitter.com/chuckmodi1/status/930814533802881024
931023283708944384 2017-11-15 04:57:03 UTC <ShaunKing> @DMooreNFL Thats not at all what Im saying. Im saying that deep stats show that good Black QBs are benched or cut long before their white counterparts.
931021524160704518 2017-11-15 04:50:03 UTC <ShaunKing> Wow. YOUR VOTE IS AN ENDORSEMENThttps://twitter.com/thebeatwithari/status/930951298723319808
931020998677356545 2017-11-15 04:47:58 UTC <ShaunKing> This is fundamentally absurd.   You cant delay an election because your candidate was discovered to be a pedophile. Its not like Roy Moore died or has even dropped out.   This election must go forward.https://twitter.com/arappeport/status/930993888650842112
930946889608032257 2017-11-15 23:53:29 UTC <ShaunKing> @TheNewSchool @ADL_National @JGreenblattADL I am hopeful that we can discuss these things in person. Of course I am not saying you are working for Breitbart, but we must all be careful not to repeat their tropes and generalizations.
930945934296600578 2017-11-15 23:49:41 UTC <ShaunKing> @PopChassid @kyjlue @acandidworld @EgSophie I agree with all of this.
930921997818908672 2017-11-15 22:14:34 UTC <ShaunKing> @kyjlue @acandidworld I am a very active listener here. I read and re-read what @PopChassid wrote. I have fought against antisemitism for years. This does not mean that I will always agree. Let's keep talking. I love and respect Linda. I stand by my words that she is not antisemitic.
930921554271186944 2017-11-15 22:12:48 UTC <ShaunKing> @PopChassid @kyjlue @acandidworld Secondly, I am not passing the cold shoulder to "The Jews."   I disagreed with you. This, I believe, is the root of the problem.   We have to be able to offer rebuttals and critiques without someone saying I spoke against "The Jews" or that she's antisemitic.
930921212905250821 2017-11-15 22:11:27 UTC <ShaunKing> @PopChassid @kyjlue @acandidworld Thanks for your thoughtful reply. I am heading in to speak at Penn State in minutes and will reply in greater detail later. I can't speak for others you've mentioned, but I have yet to see one single fact that concludes Linda is antisemitic. I know her & have read the critiques.
930917081389912065 2017-11-15 21:55:02 UTC <ShaunKing> @TheNewSchool @ADL_National @JGreenblattADL Again, Jonathan. This simply isnt true. Many Jewish organizations take Linda seriously and took this panel seriously. In fact, youve fallen for a painful Breitbart/white supremacist trap here by your foolhardy attack on her. Im very disappointed man.
930916415292542977 2017-11-15 21:52:23 UTC <ShaunKing> @JGreenblattADL Jonathan - I fundamentally reject what youve said here for several different reasons man.   1. Linda is not antisemitic  2. Its important to have a cross section of people calling out bigotry.  3. Its doubly important for Jews to call out Islamophobia & Muslims antisemitism.
930914428312260608 2017-11-15 21:44:29 UTC <ShaunKing> @PopChassid @kyjlue But she is not anti-Semitic. Period.

930835792037122051 2017-11-15 16:32:01 UTC <ShaunKing> Tyrod Taylor is in the Top 10 in completion percentage and has the best interception rate among ALL active quarterbacks.   He is about as accurate as it gets in the NFL.https://twitter.com/BuddyMike91/status/930834224126529536
930827028047257600 2017-11-15 15:57:12 UTC <ShaunKing> @gulagscrap @Buffalogal Gross. Block that person. I will now too.
930820541941985280 2017-11-15 15:31:25 UTC <ShaunKing> READ THIS.

930816182239813634 2017-11-15 15:14:06 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump has now deleted this tweet, presumably after he was told that he just wrote about the wrong mass shooting.pic.twitter.com/0qS77W1cut
930815935426039808 2017-11-15 15:13:07 UTC <ShaunKing> @Buffalogal I have no interest in fanning flames. Overwhelming evidence exists showing that good black QBs get benched or cut much sooner than their white counterparts
930814017551167495 2017-11-15 15:05:30 UTC <ShaunKing> Again, NFL teams continue to mistreat Black quarterbacks.   Benching Tyrod Taylor is absolutely outrageous.https://twitter.com/CBSSports/status/930811068053708800
930801443841359877 2017-11-15 14:15:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Never in the history of the @NFL have 2 quarterbacks who've been given more chances, with more teams, with so little success faced off.

930416233824047105 2017-11-14 12:44:51 UTC <ShaunKing> @shaypepper @edstetzer @jackmjenkins Also, he's still polling as either tied or ahead. This isn't a typo or a letter of support. People in Alabama, particularly white evangelicals, still support him.
930415901408710658 2017-11-14 12:43:31 UTC <ShaunKing> @shaypepper @edstetzer @jackmjenkins Seems like you are all but ignoring this pastor - who said he'll never believe the women and still supports Moore.

930414790446546949 2017-11-14 12:39:06 UTC <ShaunKing> During Donald Trump's campaign, hate crimes exploded across the country - targeting the very people his campaign repeatedly demeaned.https://twitter.com/AP/status/930269091172102144
930412840317521921 2017-11-14 12:31:22 UTC <ShaunKing> @shaypepper @edstetzer @jackmjenkins 4. I'll close with this - evangelicals around the country continue to rally behind horrible white men, including Donald Trump. Trump's support among white evangelicals is huge. Both Trump & Moore have very similar problems.
930412507591839744 2017-11-14 12:30:02 UTC <ShaunKing> @shaypepper @edstetzer @jackmjenkins 3. Are you clear how political support letters are made? It seems like you are taking typos to justify throwing the whole letter out.   Some people didn't know their name would be put on the letter, but they gave their support. That's how this happens every day.
930412142980943872 2017-11-14 12:28:35 UTC <ShaunKing> @shaypepper @edstetzer @jackmjenkins Let's engage on this a bit.  1. Are you saying that evangelicals in Alabama aren't deeply supportive of Roy Moore? They are his biggest supporters.  2. He is an awful man. This was widely known last month, last year, etc.

930304716352950272 2017-11-13 05:21:43 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump claimed he signed more laws than any President ever at this point in their administration.   LIES. COMPLETE LIES.  He signed the second FEWEST in generations.https://twitter.com/govtrack/status/930269127012438016

930220965597995009 2017-11-13 23:48:55 UTC <ShaunKing> Ive worked in jails and prisons for nearly 20 years now.  Ive met thousands of (Black) men in those jails and prisons for what Donald Trump and Bill Clinton and Roy Moore did.  I say this again. These men broke the law and the system conspired to protect them.
930219196113440768 2017-11-13 23:41:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Again. Read this then reply. Bill Clinton sexually assaulted women for decades.  https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/reckoning-with-bill-clintons-sex-crimes/545729/https://twitter.com/notefromself/status/930217385558192129

930216674292387840 2017-11-13 23:31:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Its time for people to stop protecting Bill Clinton.   Maybe you sincerely arent aware of just how many women have said they were sexually assaulted by him?  I believe them just like I believe the women assaulted by Roy Moore.
930185807188643841 2017-11-13 21:29:13 UTC <ShaunKing> I think weve reached the place where every reasonable person understands that Colin Kaepernick has been banned from the NFL because he took a knee.  And thats a problem.  I encourage all of you to continue to boycott the NFL

930172529297248256 2017-11-13 20:36:27 UTC <ShaunKing> A widely respected District Attorney said it was well known that Roy Moore preferred young teenage girls when he was in his 30s and that hundreds of people could testify to him being seen with them at the local mall, at football games, etc.
930167171476525056 2017-11-13 20:15:10 UTC <ShaunKing> If you watched Beverly Young Nelson describe being sexually assaulted by Roy Moore, and think this is all a big political hoax, then you are a truly sick individual.
930166342464000002 2017-11-13 20:11:52 UTC <ShaunKing> I suspect we will see many more women come forward who were sexually assaulted by Roy Moore when they were kids.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/930164743142289409

929065790757842945 2017-11-10 19:18:40 UTC <ShaunKing> @hasanthehun ABSOLUTELY man.
929065186526363648 2017-11-10 19:16:16 UTC <ShaunKing> 4 women put their names and personal lives on the line, with over 30 witnesses backing them up, to say that when this man was in his 30s he pursued relationships with little girls.   Stop saying "if this is true."  This is as true as it gets.
929064002520584192 2017-11-10 19:11:34 UTC <ShaunKing> The new "thoughts and prayers" is clearly "if this is true."  When conservatives say they'll give gun violence thoughts and prayers, they really mean they won't do a thing.   When they say Roy Moore should step down "if this is true" they mean they will wait it all out.

929048956662841344 2017-11-10 18:11:46 UTC <ShaunKing> @JimClarkeAP Right! Its brutal. Ive been right along that trail in Alaska too. NYC can be brutal.
929048493758566400 2017-11-10 18:09:56 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. DAMN its cold in NYC.  2. People dont really talk about how windy it is here.  3. Its so cold.
929045009889980416 2017-11-10 17:56:05 UTC <ShaunKing> Elected officials in Alabama are literally arguing that the victims of Roy Moore should be prosecuted. I had to read it multiple times to make sure I didn't misunderstand.
929026369178275842 2017-11-10 16:42:01 UTC <ShaunKing> Absolutely.   For the next Democratic Primary to be a success it needs the BEST of the BEST. 10-12 diverse candidates.https://twitter.com/SandonLeeJacobs/status/929025821255393280

929009654147047425 2017-11-10 15:35:36 UTC <ShaunKing> @jwpetersNYT hey man. Im not trying to be rude, but it felt like you softballed the Bannon questions on white nationalism. Did you press him and it not make the cut? Evidence is overwhelming

928825209427300352 2017-11-09 03:22:41 UTC <ShaunKing> Heres the corner Republicans have backed themselves into by making Trump their President.

928749225336295425 2017-11-09 22:20:45 UTC <ShaunKing> What we are too often missing here is what these men (Weinstein, Trump, Spacey, Roy Moore, Louis CK, etc.) did was not just wrong or inappropriate, SEXUAL ASSAULT IS ILLEGAL.   These men broke the law. Most can and should still be charged.
928745098313166853 2017-11-09 22:04:21 UTC <ShaunKing> When I say that white privilege protected Devin Kelley, I think one quote from this latest story says it all.  "He was always getting into trouble," Edwards said of Kelley. "It was problem after problem."  YET HE WAS PUNISHED FOR NONE OF THEM. NONE.   ALLOWED TO STOCKPILE GUNS.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/928744635899445249

928664993331077120 2017-11-09 16:46:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Because an essential feature of white privilege is freedom from consequences from many mistakes, white people often genuinely struggle to detect that they ever benefited from it.   The benefit was invisible to them.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/928345342118187008
928663928896475136 2017-11-09 16:41:49 UTC <ShaunKing> It had EVERYTHING to do with how the Texas shooter lived a violent life for nearly a decade without consequence.  Everything.https://twitter.com/juryprofiler/status/928347520408936448
928656374996889600 2017-11-09 16:11:48 UTC <ShaunKing> One reason Trump is putting unqualified people in charge of education is because the better educated people get, the more they despise Trump.https://twitter.com/peterbakernyt/status/928610286126403584

928395686390968320 2017-11-08 22:55:55 UTC <ShaunKing> White people fight against background checks and spend hundreds of millions of dollars to make it easy to buy guns.   This white man takes a look at a Black customer then all of a sudden loves gun control.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/928389160494276609
928389955105312768 2017-11-08 22:33:08 UTC <ShaunKing> This man has no criminal background and is refused service.   Now compare this to the gun shops who sold Texas church shooter Devin Kelley a stockpile of assault rifles and ammo after a lifetime of violence.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/928389160494276609
928389160494276609 2017-11-08 22:29:59 UTC <ShaunKing> White man refuses to sell a gun to a Black customer after guessing that he might sell them to criminals on the street. A damn mess.pic.twitter.com/m07cy1O0u5
928379079484731402 2017-11-08 21:49:55 UTC <ShaunKing> White privilege personified.  Here is an updated list of the many violent crimes Texas shooter Devin Kelley was never held responsible for.   Had ANY of these been taken seriously he would have been banned from stockpiling assault rifles & ammo.pic.twitter.com/nJYPoirm2t
928376600638492672 2017-11-08 21:40:04 UTC <ShaunKing> I can't believe the shit I am learning about this man, Devin Kelley. The fact that he was allowed to stockpile guns and ammo is a massive failure of the entire justice system and one of the worst examples of white privilege I've ever witnessed.
928375641350733824 2017-11-08 21:36:15 UTC <ShaunKing> I just learned several additional warning signs that were all but ignored from this man. Will share in my next tweet.   Just disgusting.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/928345342118187008

928358387204706315 2017-11-08 20:27:42 UTC <ShaunKing> @MrRMadar Always man
928357071912914944 2017-11-08 20:22:28 UTC <ShaunKing> This is why in the United States a white man fresh out of prison has an easier chance finding a job than a Black man fresh out of college.

928356467131940872 2017-11-08 20:20:04 UTC <ShaunKing> We live in the only nation in the world that has more guns than people.  Even with all of those guns, this nation had countless warning signs that this man would be violent, but his whiteness served as a hedge of protection against his own violent past.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/928345342118187008
928349825359335424 2017-11-08 19:53:40 UTC <ShaunKing> 13. Final point.  Even in death, Devin Kelley is given white privilege.   He's not called a monster or an animal - even though he was a horrible, violent man for years on end.   This is an exclusive function of his whiteness.   //End of thread.
928349382159814659 2017-11-08 19:51:55 UTC <ShaunKing> 12. Consequently - dozens of people who knew Devin Kelley have now openly said what he did didn't surprise them even a little.   America made Devin Kelley and white privilege gave him break after break.
928348908635459585 2017-11-08 19:50:02 UTC <ShaunKing> 11. This nation had already taught Devin Kelley a very clear lesson.   His violence against babies, against women, against animals - would always be treated with a wink and a nod.   So he made no effort to hide it.
928348582603841538 2017-11-08 19:48:44 UTC <ShaunKing> 10. Then, having fractured the skull of a child, having beaten women in multiple states, having been seen beating animals, accused of rape, Devin Kelley not only bought an assault rifle and 500 rounds of ammunition.   HE POSTED IT ALL ON FACEBOOK.
928348320954757120 2017-11-08 19:47:42 UTC <ShaunKing> 9. America's jails and prisons are full of Black and Brown bodies who never got the repeated breaks and passes and second chances that Devin Kelley received.
928348177408905216 2017-11-08 19:47:08 UTC <ShaunKing> 8. The United States criminal justice system had, to my knowledge, 7 different chances to stop Devin Kelley before he slaughtered 26 people and shot 20 others.   Each time - he got a pass.   This pass is the root of white privilege.
928347895685943296 2017-11-08 19:46:00 UTC <ShaunKing> 7. In Colorado, neighbors called the police on Devin Kelley because they saw him literally punching his dog right in its face.   Police did nothing.   For domestic violence, rape, cruelty to animals...  Devin Kelley KEPT GETTING A BREAK.
928347641901174784 2017-11-08 19:45:00 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. Over the past 5 years, police have REGULARLY been called on Devin Kelley for domestic violence.   He was accused sexual assault/rape.
928347444177461249 2017-11-08 19:44:13 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. After Devin Kelley fractured his stepson's skull, he was supposed to lose his right to purchase firearms.   He didn't.   The Air Force claims they forgot to file the paperwork.
928347082641039360 2017-11-08 19:42:47 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. For deliberately fracturing the skull of an infant and physically beating his wife, Devin Kelley spent 12 months in "confinement."  I have friends who've done YEARS for selling weed to friends and family.   Think of Meek Mill right now.
928346701814992896 2017-11-08 19:41:16 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. In 2012, Devin Kelly beat his stepson so severely he fractured his skull with what the Air Force called:  a force likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm.   The chief prosecutor in the case said that Kelley openly admitted to the abuse.
928346299971325952 2017-11-08 19:39:40 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. Long before Devin Kelley walked into the First Baptist Church of Sutherland, Texas - his violence was well known and copiously documented. This was a singular consequence of his white privilege.
928345914032508928 2017-11-08 19:38:08 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. An essential feature of white privilege is relative freedom from the harsh consequences of significant mistakes. //THREAD on the Texas church shooter Devin Kelley.

928303417889521666 2017-11-08 16:49:16 UTC <ShaunKing> Absolutely!! This win was, for me, the most underrated, underreported win of the night yesterday.https://twitter.com/People4Bernie/status/928091024152506368

928151870996180993 2017-11-07 06:47:04 UTC <ShaunKing> @cFidd looks like that 50-50 tie is a lock unless a recount happens in Newport News. Will the provisional ballots be counted? Thanks
928151099340664832 2017-11-07 06:44:00 UTC <ShaunKing> As it stands right now, the Virginia State House will be tied 50-50.
928149935337410562 2017-11-07 06:39:23 UTC <ShaunKing> I see all that Breitbart coverage and Mercer money didnt quite work for you @RobAstorino. Next time try rejecting white supremacy instead of embracing it and their money.https://twitter.com/robastorino/status/928029341564448769

928146829853777920 2017-11-07 06:27:03 UTC <ShaunKing> I believe after today you will see an ever so slight uptick in Republicans who distance themselves from Donald Trump.
928145707311271937 2017-11-07 06:22:35 UTC <ShaunKing> Follow the Newport News race closely. It could break Democrat.pic.twitter.com/NVR0CDYDDJ
928144426660012032 2017-11-07 06:17:30 UTC <ShaunKing> I think a cool feature of the #280characters would be if you only got 1-3 chances to use it per day - to make it really count. Itd be a special feature and not the standard.
928143934265659392 2017-11-07 06:15:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Virginia is SOOOOOO close to flipping their State House of Delegates to Democrats.   Would be a shocking outcome. May not know for hours. The outstanding races are too close to call.

927308991239217152 2017-11-05 22:57:46 UTC <ShaunKing> In a recent Facebook picture of his AR-15, Sutherland Springs gunman Devin Patrick Kelley called it "a bad bitch." His friends all agreed.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/927306946478329856
927306946478329856 2017-11-05 22:49:39 UTC <ShaunKing> Devin Patrick Kelley, the Sutherland Springs shooter, recently posted a picture of himself with an AR-15 online.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/927285846168031232
927304814937169925 2017-11-05 22:41:11 UTC <ShaunKing> Told you it wasn't terrorism. One key word in this tweet confirms it.   Guess which one.https://twitter.com/ABC/status/927303603370496004
927303596529606660 2017-11-05 22:36:20 UTC <ShaunKing> You can't make this stuff up.https://twitter.com/S_Saeen/status/927298569245208577
927302908999274496 2017-11-05 22:33:36 UTC <ShaunKing> After every mass shooting, white supremacists put out this fake identity. A congressman literally just repeated it on CNN.   2017.https://twitter.com/jjmacnab/status/927299303508467713
927302504508985345 2017-11-05 22:32:00 UTC <ShaunKing> The repetitive nature of the aftermath of mass-shootings is wild.   Conservatives really are saying "now is not the time to politicize this"
927296637499736070 2017-11-05 22:08:41 UTC <ShaunKing> Just saw where @RepGonzalez says the shooting "was not terrorism" and that it appears the shooter knew someone in the church.

927291628167016448 2017-11-05 21:48:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Listen.  I am absolutely appalled by what has happened.   I am even more appalled by how little our leaders do TO STOP MASS SHOOTINGS.https://twitter.com/JohnThomasTV/status/927291172850225152

927287147224293378 2017-11-05 21:30:58 UTC <ShaunKing> Nothing to see here.   It is as American as apple pie for white men to slaughter dozens.   Thoughts and prayers for everyone.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/927285846168031232
927285846168031232 2017-11-05 21:25:48 UTC <ShaunKing> Don't worry everybody.   It was a white man who slaughtered half of the church in Texas.   That means everything is just fine.  No terrorism

927261366246936576 2017-11-05 19:48:32 UTC <ShaunKing> When they say our prayers are with you, they dont even mean that. Mass shootings get a few fleeting thoughts and thats it nowadays.https://twitter.com/nbcnightlynews/status/927260299509534721
927261015355674626 2017-11-05 19:47:08 UTC <ShaunKing> America.   To be frank, our nation really doesnt care. This is as common as can be. Our nation is unwilling to address hard problems.https://twitter.com/jesserodriguez/status/927247565577441280
927237550477103104 2017-11-05 18:13:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump now has the worst poll numbers in modern history.  66% of the country thinks hes a liar.http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/05/politics/wapo-abc-poll-nov-5/index.html
927231108755881984 2017-11-05 17:48:18 UTC <ShaunKing> I still believe we will learn that Flynn is a cooperating witness. He will likely take a deal to protect his son.https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/927193709241884672
927208145105162241 2017-11-05 16:17:03 UTC <ShaunKing> @NajaySez I agree with your take. Lets just get to work and fix the problems. We have to identify the problems and the causes and the people though
927203904483479553 2017-11-05 16:00:12 UTC <ShaunKing> It is peculiar. I have never seen a group lose so much, at such a high cost, and remain downright indignant and self-righteous about it all.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/926989217997062144
927203189304242176 2017-11-05 15:57:21 UTC <ShaunKing> @Darren_Mooney I think its because they are restricted to tell his whole story the way it deserves
927202217647591428 2017-11-05 15:53:29 UTC <ShaunKing> @chancetherapper @DemetriaObilor Standing with you!! The haters are just making you more well known and loved

927036339652124672 2017-11-04 04:54:21 UTC <ShaunKing> Also, Michael Bisping was so honorable in defeat. He worked hard to get to the top, fought a hell of a fight, and gave his best.
927035745570783232 2017-11-04 04:51:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Huge congrats to GSP on coming back from a 4 year retirement to become the middleweight champ. Such an impressive feat. Gracious words too.

926787564693942275 2017-11-04 12:25:48 UTC <ShaunKing> J. Edgar Hoover was one of the most despicable men of the 20th century. He was a lifelong bigot who despised & undermined Black leaders.

926244832523284481 2017-11-02 00:29:11 UTC <ShaunKing> @AnitaMCal Did you get a chance to read the piece. It's true.
926239413792894977 2017-11-02 00:07:39 UTC <ShaunKing> Kaepernicks worst year was better than this mans best year. No playoffs, cut from team after team.   But STILL got a job.   Its bullshit.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/926238978612834306
926238978612834306 2017-11-02 00:05:55 UTC <ShaunKing> Matt McGloin threw 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions TOTAL in the past 3 NFL seasons.   Kaepernick threw 16 TDs & 4 interceptions last year.
926237548325810177 2017-11-02 00:00:14 UTC <ShaunKing> Yeah. Really. Colin Kaepernick is unemployed and MATT MCGLOIN just got a job.https://twitter.com/aaronwilson_nfl/status/926200146035126272
926231993712553984 2017-11-02 23:38:10 UTC <ShaunKing> Whatever you think Hillary did for state parties and down-ticket candidates should begin & end with this articlehttps://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670
926231683845836800 2017-11-02 23:36:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Hillary said she was raising money for state parties to rebuild them from the ground up. Kept 99.5% of the money.  https://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670
926230913348001797 2017-11-02 23:33:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Patton is a comedian. And this tweet is a joke. Down-ticket candidates in state parties got 1/2 of 1% of the funds. State parties are a messhttps://twitter.com/pattonoswalt/status/926186811319230464
926229747000135680 2017-11-02 23:29:14 UTC <ShaunKing> I literally had 8-10 @DNAinfoNY articles bookmarked for a criminal justice story Im working on and now they are gone. This is ridiculous.

926218320738770945 2017-11-02 22:43:50 UTC <ShaunKing> Wow. @SenWarren says it again, but this time on @NewsHour.   The DNC rigged the primary for Hillary Clinton.https://twitter.com/newshour/status/926209457683599361
926216062835838976 2017-11-02 22:34:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Since Elizabeth Warren & Donna Brazile both said the DNC rigged the primary for Hillary, Im interested if critics will call THEM BernieBros
926198975115550725 2017-11-02 21:26:58 UTC <ShaunKing> It didnt get much coverage, but I stated last year that people close to Warren told me she wanted to run and was told it was not her timehttps://twitter.com/cnnpolitics/status/926188895850696706

926130143835410432 2017-11-02 16:53:27 UTC <ShaunKing> In light of the DNCs financial and organizational struggles, the fact that Tom Perez took a 2nd job is interestinghttp://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170906/tom-perez-former-us-labor-secretary-to-teach-at-brown
926129350633771008 2017-11-02 16:50:18 UTC <ShaunKing> @adrielhampton For sure
926129255850954753 2017-11-02 16:49:55 UTC <ShaunKing> @BenSpielberg This was an excerpt from her book. My understanding is that she addresses it there
926129137374388224 2017-11-02 16:49:27 UTC <ShaunKing> @IAMANITABAKER Yes and no. The party is in tatters. The DNC has no money. Republicans now control the House, Senate, the Presidency, and most state govs
926127910863429633 2017-11-02 16:44:35 UTC <ShaunKing> @shadihamid True
926127710128263174 2017-11-02 16:43:47 UTC <ShaunKing> No.   In the book, she throws Clinton, Wasserman-Schultz, and Obama under the bus for their failures.   This is a reckoning.https://twitter.com/nobody_special1/status/926127233621680128
926127183881318401 2017-11-02 16:41:41 UTC <ShaunKing> The Democratic Party is her lifes work. Knowing this, you must view what she has said as her courageous attempt at saving it from itself.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/926083849922195456
926126932198031360 2017-11-02 16:40:41 UTC <ShaunKing> Donna Brazile basically just became a whistleblower for corruption & incompetence within the Democratic Party. It took major guts to do so.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/926083849922195456
926126431993769984 2017-11-02 16:38:42 UTC <ShaunKing> No, actually. She had a private conversation and a public face. Politics 101.https://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/926090192984969216
926124786551590912 2017-11-02 16:32:10 UTC <ShaunKing> @IAMANITABAKER Hey! First off, I love you. Secondly, I understand the spirit of what you are saying, but the money wasnt for her party. It was for her.
926116616902934528 2017-11-02 15:59:42 UTC <ShaunKing> Since Donna Braziles article came out, several Democratic insiders wrote me to say the party is completely broke, struggling to pay bills
926108980715360259 2017-11-02 15:29:21 UTC <ShaunKing> @johniadarola We were already at zero disclosure. This is progress
926100933024669696 2017-11-02 14:57:23 UTC <ShaunKing> @JordanChariton You cant heal what you wont reveal.
926083849922195456 2017-11-02 13:49:30 UTC <ShaunKing> I think what Donna Brazile just did not only took so much courage, it was a HUGE step toward healing a deep rift/wound from 2016.
926077693342470144 2017-11-02 13:25:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Just read the intro to Donna Braziles whistleblower piece on corruption inside of the Democratic Party.  https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774pic.twitter.com/rzPYISuDeT
926075895927967745 2017-11-02 13:17:53 UTC <ShaunKing> @daveweigel Absolutely
926075553630818304 2017-11-02 13:16:32 UTC <ShaunKing> It is a sin among most Democrats to ever highlight a single Obama fault, but Donna Brazile makes clear he ran the DNC into the ground.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/926071970998968328

926070983697551360 2017-11-02 12:58:22 UTC <ShaunKing> Shame on the DNC, on Hillary Clinton, and every Democratic operative responsible for this bullshit. What a mess.  https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774

926068544378466310 2017-11-02 12:48:41 UTC <ShaunKing> If you ask ANYONE who is close to operations of the DNC today they will tell you that things are still a complete mess there financially.https://twitter.com/blakehounshell/status/926044671029268480

926063457023283200 2017-11-02 12:28:28 UTC <ShaunKing> Advocating the death penalty before trial isn't justice, it's a lynching. I despise what this man did to our city, but Trump is wrong here.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/926054936718307328
926047776118661120 2017-11-02 11:26:09 UTC <ShaunKing> I have to admit that they called this 3 years ago, with the eventual World Series MVP in the cover, is so boss.https://twitter.com/sinow/status/925935366967881730

925762599089827840 2017-11-01 16:32:58 UTC <ShaunKing> Thank you to the @UofHartford for announcing that Brianna Brochu has been permanently banned from the university.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/925541171207778304
925761410843467776 2017-11-01 16:28:14 UTC <ShaunKing> I absolutely think what happened in NYC yesterday was terrorism. No doubt.  But so was what Dylann Roof did in Charleston.   Thats all.
925761016969007104 2017-11-01 16:26:40 UTC <ShaunKing> I am 100% for intelligent policies to prevent terrorist attacks like what happened in NYC.  But we must also stop Vegas & Charlottesville.
925760427937628160 2017-11-01 16:24:20 UTC <ShaunKing> I want to be clear on something. I am incredibly angry at what this asshole did here in NYC yesterday. It is terrorism  But so was Las Vegas

925559264109875205 2017-10-31 03:04:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump and his bigoted fear-mongering are painfully predictable.
925558102472183808 2017-10-31 03:00:22 UTC <ShaunKing> Again, a white man shot FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE in Las Vegas and Trump had NOTHING.   Zilch  No solutions.  No policies.  No ideas.  Nothing.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925534445393928199

925541884927336448 2017-10-31 01:55:55 UTC <ShaunKing> @UofHartford 3. Briana Brochu was actually poisoning her Black roommate. Admitted to it on Instagram like it was funny.
925541529208442880 2017-10-31 01:54:30 UTC <ShaunKing> @UofHartford 2. Her roommate noticed that she kept getting sick. She knew Brochu was rude & cold, but it turned out it was much much worse.
925541171207778304 2017-10-31 01:53:05 UTC <ShaunKing> Let me introduce you to Briana Brochu.    She was just arrested for the repeated criminal assault of her Black college roommate @UofHartfordpic.twitter.com/nmzhHQDTb9

925355144006467584 2017-10-31 13:33:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Bob Mueller is a lifelong Republican who was appointed special prosecutor BY A TRUMP APPOINTEE.   This isn't a leftwing conspiracy.
925352848119992321 2017-10-31 13:24:45 UTC <ShaunKing> @washingtonpost In a 2016 interview with the @WashingtonPost, when asked who was helping to lead his foreign policy team - Trump said:  George Papadopouloshttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925335577217683456
925326257197404160 2017-10-31 11:39:06 UTC <ShaunKing> This turned out to be true. From all reports, Trump was blindsided by his guilty plea and was seething over it.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/925022478925287424

925028138480013312 2017-10-30 15:54:29 UTC <ShaunKing> You knew him.   Not only is Trump sitting at the table with Papadopoulos here - he introduced him by name as a "great" member of his team.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/715725628465680386
925027715039801344 2017-10-30 15:52:48 UTC <ShaunKing> Here is Trump's tweet at the table w/ Papadopoulos, days after Papadopoulos began his communications w/ Russians to get dirt on Clinton.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/715725628465680386
925022478925287424 2017-10-30 15:31:59 UTC <ShaunKing> I dont think he knew Papadopoulos, his own foreign policy advisor, had entered a guilty plea, when he wrote this tweet.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/925006418989715456
925022023235067905 2017-10-30 15:30:11 UTC <ShaunKing> General Flynn will be next.
925020062485970944 2017-10-30 15:22:23 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump posted this on his Instagram in March of 2016. W/ Papadopoulos, Sessions, and others during the campaign.pic.twitter.com/cMRzoqGn5v
925016318214131712 2017-10-30 15:07:30 UTC <ShaunKing> The indictment of Papadopoulos is explosive. Reading it. He lied repeatedly to the FBI about his contact with Russia to get dirt in Clinton.

924999311074758656 2017-10-30 13:59:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump has known Paul Manafort for nearly 40 years. First hired him for lobbying over 30 years ago. He owns a home in Trump Tower.
924988246140088321 2017-10-30 13:15:57 UTC <ShaunKing> Bob Mueller won't be doing a press conference. Now, or ever. That's not his style. He won't explain anything else, but will keep working.
924987553270390785 2017-10-30 13:13:12 UTC <ShaunKing> Where Paul Manafort's adult children says their money is "blood money" and that their dad has had people killed.http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/10/politics/ukraine-manafort-hacked-texts/index.html

924982959345717248 2017-10-30 12:54:57 UTC <ShaunKing> I'll tell you what you won't see.  You won't see ONE elected Republican defend the character or integrity of Paul Manafort.   He's a bad man

924974997705252866 2017-10-30 12:23:19 UTC <ShaunKing> Today, the Trump team will try to pretend they dont know Paul Manafort. HE HAS A HOME IN TRUMP TOWER and ran the Trump campaign.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/924973815507161089
924974718372937728 2017-10-30 12:22:12 UTC <ShaunKing> To be clear, Paul Manaforts adult children have said he was literally having people murdered behind the scenes.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/924973815507161089

924852301801672704 2017-10-29 04:15:46 UTC <ShaunKing> You pretty much have to swing at whatever pitch comes your way in this game because you have no idea what this ump will call if you look
924847748129677314 2017-10-29 03:57:40 UTC <ShaunKing> This is crazy.

924843786366259200 2017-10-29 03:41:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Makes that bunt look even goofier.

924764515039932422 2017-10-29 22:26:56 UTC <ShaunKing> I think we are clearly approaching the point where Donald Trump is going to fire Mueller before the investigation fully engulfs him.

924694188016525314 2017-10-29 17:47:29 UTC <ShaunKing> It is so damn shameful that Donald Trump is President of the United States. A national embarrassment.
924692753329655808 2017-10-29 17:41:47 UTC <ShaunKing> We live in a time where the closest friends and advisors to the President of the United States get banned for violent physical threats.https://twitter.com/davidmackau/status/924392097733578757
924684124413100034 2017-10-29 17:07:29 UTC <ShaunKing> The United States is in a deeply unstable time. Far less stable than most of us are willing to admit. Its very problematic.
924683625777520642 2017-10-29 17:05:30 UTC <ShaunKing> On Friday & Saturday political experts, historians, & people from Watergate said the worst thing Trump could do is precisely what hes doinghttps://twitter.com/nytimes/status/924682260720377857
924683273950941184 2017-10-29 17:04:06 UTC <ShaunKing> It is dangerous & irresponsible for the President of the United States to encourage his allies to DO SOMETHING to his political opponents
924674268234964993 2017-10-29 16:28:19 UTC <ShaunKing> Do the math. Between 65-70% of the NFL is Black.https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/924638825653121024
924670688430051328 2017-10-29 16:14:06 UTC <ShaunKing> Wow. I asked a player from the Texans if any white players plan to protest and he said No. Its pretty much split right down racial lines.

923514881646743552 2017-10-26 11:41:20 UTC <ShaunKing> @CCCNewYork I rarely accept awards, but I think what we accomplished together in New York can/should be used as a model for change around the country.
923514470839869440 2017-10-26 11:39:42 UTC <ShaunKing> Deeply honored this morning to be receiving an award from @CCCNewYork on behalf of thousands of us who helped pass Raise The Age here...

923273562739367936 2017-10-25 19:42:25 UTC <ShaunKing> @stephenasmith @maxkellerman @willcain You have no idea of his grasp. None. And every time you pretend like you do you make a complete fool of yourself.

923267297049014274 2017-10-25 19:17:31 UTC <ShaunKing> @stephenasmith @maxkellerman @willcain Colins silence HAS NOTHING to do with his mastery or ability to discuss or debate these issues. What even gave you that thought?

923249429267795969 2017-10-25 18:06:31 UTC <ShaunKing> @BalchSpringsPD @BalchSpringsTX @MeritLaw has discovered a well documented history of racism & brutality within the dept & shared it with the city. Nothing has been done.
923248818312884224 2017-10-25 18:04:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @BalchSpringsPD @BalchSpringsTX The city of Balch Springs hasn't looked at its department, the city council said it should look for programs to keep kids off the street?
923248544584171520 2017-10-25 18:03:00 UTC <ShaunKing> @BalchSpringsPD @BalchSpringsTX The officer who trained #RoyOliver is also a known abusive racist. He is still on the force.
923248221102714882 2017-10-25 18:01:43 UTC <ShaunKing> @BalchSpringsPD @BalchSpringsTX #RoyOliver had a documented explosive temper that the PD had been warned about by the DA
923248021789466631 2017-10-25 18:00:56 UTC <ShaunKing> @BalchSpringsPD @BalchSpringsTX The chief lied initially saying Jordan's car was moving toward a cop- it wasn't. He changed his statement & claimed he misspoke. He lied.

923020510279225345 2017-10-24 02:56:53 UTC <ShaunKing> True. They dont like Trump personally but support almost all of his policies.   They are not our friends. Period.https://twitter.com/alexanderemmons/status/923014378361720833

922931986376871937 2017-10-24 21:05:07 UTC <ShaunKing> This is the root of Trumps presidency and supports why @tanehisicoates called him the first white president.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/922900768629420032
922926844214632449 2017-10-24 20:44:41 UTC <ShaunKing> Nothing disturbs white entertainment more than black righteousness, black empowerment, and certainly black protest.
922926514290622464 2017-10-24 20:43:22 UTC <ShaunKing> Because the NFL was created for white entertainment, white men are fully willing to tolerate black criminality, but LOATHE black empowerment
922925936017793025 2017-10-24 20:41:04 UTC <ShaunKing> The @NFL was created for white entertainment  At the point in which a significant number of white people aren't entertained, backlash ensues
922925496760803328 2017-10-24 20:39:20 UTC <ShaunKing> Let me tell you the root of why Colin Kaepernick is not in the NFL right now in my next tweet.
922922678092120065 2017-10-24 20:28:08 UTC <ShaunKing> If you search the Wikipedia page for the NFL stats of Mike Bercovici, you will find none. They literally list old NFL combine details.pic.twitter.com/pVW9Nmf8eV
922922015828221952 2017-10-24 20:25:30 UTC <ShaunKing> And today, the Cardinals just signed QB Mike Bercovici to the team.   No, you've never heard of him. He's never played in a single NFL game.
922921762395799552 2017-10-24 20:24:29 UTC <ShaunKing> Very clearly, @BruceArians, when asked if the Cardinals would sign Colin Kaepernick, said they wouldn't be signing a quarterback at all.
922921559571832832 2017-10-24 20:23:41 UTC <ShaunKing> A day after announcing they would not be signing a QB to their squad, the Arizona Cardinals signed a QB who has never played in the NFL.pic.twitter.com/rOjwwZNOmF
922921081249316864 2017-10-24 20:21:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Something very ugly just happened in the sports world....
922910608294420485 2017-10-24 19:40:10 UTC <ShaunKing> I agree and disagree.  Speaking up and speaking out on Trump is something. It's something important.   And yes, I wish they'd caucus w/ Demshttps://twitter.com/DanTappan/status/922909962296332288
922910320183582720 2017-10-24 19:39:01 UTC <ShaunKing> I'm not saying let's make Corker or Flake our new heroes. They helped create Frankenstein and are among the first to earnestly admit it.https://twitter.com/greggorox/status/922909612176822276
922909779592228865 2017-10-24 19:36:52 UTC <ShaunKing> @DorienPaul @LeahDaughtry I believe that.
922909618258419712 2017-10-24 19:36:14 UTC <ShaunKing> I agree. Completely.   I also know it takes some people longer to speak up and speak out against the machine than others. It's never easy.https://twitter.com/DanielTheTEMP/status/922907922774061056
922909425072988160 2017-10-24 19:35:28 UTC <ShaunKing> I don't think it's ever spineless to speak up and speak out on evil or corruption or incompetence. These men are absolutely late, but right.https://twitter.com/jmikegallo/status/922907790347329537
922909193555685376 2017-10-24 19:34:33 UTC <ShaunKing> I don't know if it's easy. It's certainly easier. And I accept that. But what Corker and Flake are doing still takes guts in this climatehttps://twitter.com/cebsilver/status/922908911862276097
922908803435184128 2017-10-24 19:33:00 UTC <ShaunKing> @JamilesLartey right. haha
922908693741502464 2017-10-24 19:32:34 UTC <ShaunKing> 7. That's all. When people you don't like do the right thing, the important thing, even if they've been enemies before, that's progress.
922908240832106496 2017-10-24 19:30:46 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. Yes, it took Flake & Corker announcing their retirements to call out Trump. Yes it took Trump attacking them for them to speak boldly. OK
922908024292851712 2017-10-24 19:29:54 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. Our politics must be nuanced enough such that we know that Flake & Corker are NOT our friends AND what they are doing right now is right.
922907585736351745 2017-10-24 19:28:09 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. I don't agree w/ Flake or Corker (or McCain) on much of anything, but it's important that critiques of Trump come from all sides.
922907263584501760 2017-10-24 19:26:53 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. We cannot loudly & publicly say "Where in the hell are the Republicans who are willing to call out Trump?" then boo them when they do so.
922907062694068224 2017-10-24 19:26:05 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. I applaud Republicans who step out to give strong principled critiques/rebuttals of the madness of Donald Trump.
922906559130120192 2017-10-24 19:24:05 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. I must admit that I fall on a different side about Republicans like Jeff Flake & Bob Corker than many of my friends. Let me explain...

921412610687422466 2017-10-20 16:27:40 UTC <ShaunKing> General Kelly told 9 lies on @RepWilson - called her insulting names - and proceeded to fabricate a detailed story to defame her. Shameful.

917947625957097473 2017-10-10 02:59:03 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @FloridaHospital,  What your employee, Wes Giuliano, says here is an illegal death threat. This cannot be accepted.pic.twitter.com/u1oMFDhX4g
917946956995022848 2017-10-10 02:56:23 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @FloridaHospital,  When will you follow up? One of your employees has an active death threat on a woman? This is a safety emergency.https://twitter.com/floridahospital/status/917934238581829632
917946394308173824 2017-10-10 02:54:09 UTC <ShaunKing> We have so much respect for you JT. Thanks for taking a stand man.https://twitter.com/jtbrown23/status/917080562053074945
917945899233562624 2017-10-10 02:52:11 UTC <ShaunKing> I still cannot believe what has happened to @jemelehill. Its just not right.
917940399116824576 2017-10-10 02:30:20 UTC <ShaunKing> You have to hear this.   Trump officials are literally talking about tackling Trump in the case that he rushed to use nuclear weapons. https://twitter.com/allinwithchris/status/917906777387147264
917937475544371200 2017-10-10 02:18:43 UTC <ShaunKing> Imagine learning all that weve learned about Harvey Weinstein....then electing him President.  Thats exactly what America did with Trump.
917935021519974400 2017-10-10 02:08:58 UTC <ShaunKing> Painful sign of the times. Im kind of joking, but kind of not. Somehow seems like a part of a terrible trend of decline. Sucks.https://twitter.com/grantwahl/status/917931356298076160

917891383540834304 2017-10-10 23:15:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Cyrus Vance can not explain this away. We keep learning of various times he had rich New Yorkers pinned for crimes and turned his head.https://twitter.com/alexburnsnyt/status/917770137977094144
917877507709394944 2017-10-10 22:20:25 UTC <ShaunKing> Hey @terrycrews.  Thank you for speaking up and sharing this man. It took tremendous courage.
917877032582832128 2017-10-10 22:18:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Read this.https://twitter.com/i/moments/917849599213158400
917874838219476992 2017-10-10 22:09:49 UTC <ShaunKing> At this point, Deandre Harris is already in the hospital. These men got beaten, then lied and said their injuries were caused by DeAndre.https://twitter.com/meritlaw/status/917847166273671169
917852359581208576 2017-10-10 20:40:30 UTC <ShaunKing> This video of the man claiming DeAndre Harris injured him shows how he was actually injured... while DeAndre was already was in the hospitalhttps://twitter.com/MeritLaw/status/917847166273671169

917777954024894464 2017-10-10 15:44:50 UTC <ShaunKing> Yes. We are disgusted and infuriated. It took the Charlottesville Police and the family by surprise. He does not deserve this.https://twitter.com/joepabike/status/917775885733892096
917777769412653057 2017-10-10 15:44:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @joepabike Yeah
917776447917428736 2017-10-10 15:38:51 UTC <ShaunKing> Local police are now in a position to enforce a warrant they expressly told me they dont believe in.  America. 2017.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/917774606395756545
917776036099710976 2017-10-10 15:37:13 UTC <ShaunKing> Local police, whove viewed every photo and video imaginable, told me they had no intention on charging DeAndre. The whole thing is crazy.
917775686424842240 2017-10-10 15:35:49 UTC <ShaunKing> Mind you  THE TWO MAIN MEN in this picture with sticks in the air have not been arrested yet. And they have the nerve to charge DeAndre.pic.twitter.com/GorVr2SuT7
917775409487507456 2017-10-10 15:34:43 UTC <ShaunKing> A random judge, without doing ANY INVESTIGATION, went around the Charlottesville Police, to have DeAndre arrested. Its appalling.
917775150099156992 2017-10-10 15:33:41 UTC <ShaunKing> So the white supremacist found a judge he knows, who did something one officer told me he had never seen before....
917774863485546496 2017-10-10 15:32:33 UTC <ShaunKing> A white supremacist who was injured in a fight with people other than DeAndre Harris tried to get police to arrest DeAndre. They declined.
917774606395756545 2017-10-10 15:31:32 UTC <ShaunKing> The Charlottesville Police just told me that they did NOT issue an arrest warrant for DeAndre Harris. What happened is very nefarious...
917771858447097856 2017-10-10 15:20:37 UTC <ShaunKing> Shame on every single person in power who knew full well that Harvey Weinstein was victimizing women and made excuses for him.
917771530129563650 2017-10-10 15:19:18 UTC <ShaunKing> Arrest this man.   Shame on the @ManhattanDA for being well aware that all of this was happening and DOING NOTHING about it.https://twitter.com/newyorker/status/917765408412794880
917765736214466563 2017-10-10 14:56:17 UTC <ShaunKing> I know its not King Day. And I know King didnt have Snapchat, but I thought you needed to smile.pic.twitter.com/PSSQDqzbtR

917721383769202689 2017-10-10 12:00:02 UTC <ShaunKing> I kid you not, Donald Trump just challenged HIS OWN Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to an IQ test - and said Tillerson would lose.pic.twitter.com/mcyfkCUmPH
917720571160485888 2017-10-10 11:56:49 UTC <ShaunKing> Can you show me a SINGLE TWEET or angry statement Trump has ever made calling out a white man for shooting & killing a cop? Just one?https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/917707475050168320
917720319980396545 2017-10-10 11:55:49 UTC <ShaunKing> Notice that Trump doesn't call this man a Son of a Bitch.   No tweets about him shooting and killing a cop.   NOTHING.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/917707475050168320
917720059795136515 2017-10-10 11:54:47 UTC <ShaunKing> It's politically beneficial for a man elected on a wave of sexism & white supremacy to make these two people his political foes.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/917717359292448768

917717359292448768 2017-10-10 11:44:03 UTC <ShaunKing> It's no accident that Donald Trump has chosen a Black woman (Jemele Hill) and a Black man (Colin Kaepernick) as his primary targets/enemies.
917714940072480768 2017-10-10 11:34:26 UTC <ShaunKing> Is it too late for someone to enter a primary against the Manhattan District Attorney - who is running unopposed? I'll back an opponent.https://twitter.com/alykatzz/status/917714274423857152
917714410361229314 2017-10-10 11:32:20 UTC <ShaunKing> @alykatzz Right.

917582455053438976 2017-10-09 02:47:59 UTC <ShaunKing> I can answer this definitively. NO. Ive spoken to 3 players on the team who all confirm the stars will comply to every edict of Jerry Joneshttps://twitter.com/mikelesliewfaa/status/917531493450309632

917543658345369601 2017-10-09 00:13:49 UTC <ShaunKing> @_willcompton Nah. We just clearly see the world very differently.
917490017253187591 2017-10-09 20:40:40 UTC <ShaunKing> Listen to me.  These men are preparing for 8 years.   We aren't even in formation.https://twitter.com/annalecta/status/917111414682243073

917482582450802688 2017-10-09 20:11:08 UTC <ShaunKing> Everything Jemele tweeted over the past 48 hours were talked about in Black living rooms, barbershops, and beauty salons ALL WEEKEND.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/917480008205127681
917482386782334978 2017-10-09 20:10:21 UTC <ShaunKing> American sports have ALWAYS existed at the intersection of race & politics. This is true now, more than ever.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/917480008205127681
917481367054766080 2017-10-09 20:06:18 UTC <ShaunKing> Being Black in America does not afford one, even a sportswriter, to pretend like injustice doesn't exist. ESPN wants Jemele to pretend.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/917480008205127681
917480475983273984 2017-10-09 20:02:46 UTC <ShaunKing> Fundamentally, it truly seems that ESPN is so disconnected from the Black experience that when Jemele's tweets reflect it, they are botheredhttps://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/917480008205127681
917480008205127681 2017-10-09 20:00:54 UTC <ShaunKing> Jemele Hill was basically suspended for being Black and thoughtful while at ESPN. Her suspension is completely outrageous.
917417078784712716 2017-10-09 15:50:51 UTC <ShaunKing> If your cultural hero was a violent murdering rapist, and we reject him, what he did, and what he stands for, YOU ARE THE PROBLEM, not us.

917249479585288193 2017-10-08 04:44:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Got this from the family of one of the most respected players in the NFL. A moderate dude.  What Vice President Pence pulled set him off.pic.twitter.com/F8ot8AX1fe

917240019965939712 2017-10-08 04:07:16 UTC <ShaunKing> Today the Dolphins forced their players to stand for the National Anthem. https://twitter.com/sinow/status/917235840170037248

917237201364312064 2017-10-08 03:56:04 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFLPA @Underrated_Dom Right man. They have to respond to this more clearly
917237067251355648 2017-10-08 03:55:32 UTC <ShaunKing> I kid you not. He said the team is saying how their hands and feet and eyes must look during the anthem.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/917235921682161664
917236757766332416 2017-10-08 03:54:19 UTC <ShaunKing> Its not. And the @NFLPA needs to make this clearhttps://twitter.com/ellenhopkinslit/status/917235563131891717
917235921682161664 2017-10-08 03:50:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Spoke to an @NFL player just now who said his team is not just demanding that players stand, but is telling them precisely how to stand.
917234625331843072 2017-10-08 03:45:50 UTC <ShaunKing> @fishsports How was his statement a stunner? Two weeks ago multiple players told me, and I told you, that this message had already been relayed to them
917230009366007808 2017-10-08 03:27:30 UTC <ShaunKing> @KaryinBrooklyn You didnt stand? What happened?
917225207684886528 2017-10-08 03:08:25 UTC <ShaunKing> @MacEngelProf Good. Does that now give more color to what players told me two weeks ago. They knew then how he felt. Today he confirmed it
917219707794665472 2017-10-08 02:46:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Several players on the team want to take a knee but said that nobody on the team will cross Jerry. He has that much juice.https://twitter.com/chrishayner/status/917218588829691904

915698896772493312 2017-10-04 22:03:24 UTC <ShaunKing> That quote on top is real.   What they mean to say is that the Las Vegas shooter reminds them too much of themselves to hate him!pic.twitter.com/2lg6qEJKdC
915691709564178433 2017-10-04 21:34:50 UTC <ShaunKing> I need you all to listen to this podcast from Jeremy. It just dropped today. It's SPOT ON.https://twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/915560359477612544
915691003805339649 2017-10-04 21:32:02 UTC <ShaunKing> What you know, and what I know, is that if this shooter was a Muslim or an immigrant, conservatives would be on TV 24/7 w/ policy demands.
915690778252447744 2017-10-04 21:31:08 UTC <ShaunKing> No nicknames from Trump for the Las Vegas shooter.   No insults or jabs.   No policy ideas or hits on politicians who do nothing.
915690397317427201 2017-10-04 21:29:38 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump was angrier with the fucking cast of Hamilton than he was the Las Vegas shooter.   WHY?  The answer is deeply revealing.
915690084678160385 2017-10-04 21:28:23 UTC <ShaunKing> RIGHT!https://twitter.com/everywhereist/status/915689941631303680
915689982689456130 2017-10-04 21:27:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Colin Kaepernick angers Trump. Mayor of San Juan angers Trump. Rosie angers Trump.  Shooters overseas anger Trump.  Las Vegas shooter - nah.
915689651540721664 2017-10-04 21:26:40 UTC <ShaunKing> I think it's universally agreed that this exact same shooting could've happened in Vegas, but w/ a different shooter, & Trump would be angry
915689423492313089 2017-10-04 21:25:45 UTC <ShaunKing> To me, Trump's lack of anger over the 500 people being shot and 59 being killed, is deeply revealing. Think of what else angers him.
915689193149517826 2017-10-04 21:24:50 UTC <ShaunKing> Again, all I am asking is where is Trump's ANGER over the shooting in Las Vegas? I haven't even seen a hint of anger and he stays angry.
915604733951389703 2017-10-04 15:49:14 UTC <ShaunKing> Until then, I will not be as present on here as normal.   Thanks for your support.   --Shaun

915333537896726529 2017-10-03 21:51:36 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL You live in the day and age where the President of the United States threatened to humiliate the team that signs Colin Kaepernick.
915333140096446464 2017-10-03 21:50:01 UTC <ShaunKing> You live in the day and age where the @NFL has banned a man from the league for taking a peaceful stance against police brutality.
915332270290014213 2017-10-03 21:46:33 UTC <ShaunKing> @balleralert Nah
915329990438289409 2017-10-03 21:37:30 UTC <ShaunKing> Not a single expert has argued or will argue that Colin Kaepernick would be unemployed today had he never taken a knee.  That's all this is.
915329759332257797 2017-10-03 21:36:35 UTC <ShaunKing> Colin is 29 years old. Fit, healthy, strong. Injury free.   He is widely known to be one of the most intelligent men in the NFL.
915329499134296065 2017-10-03 21:35:33 UTC <ShaunKing> When @criscarter80 bumped into Colin Kaepernick here in NYC, he had the same reaction most people do: "Oh shit this man's huge."
915329105150824448 2017-10-03 21:33:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Colin Kaepernick works out like a man possessed 6 days a week. Only takes a day off because trainers advised it. He is fit & strong as hell.
915328336997568512 2017-10-03 21:30:56 UTC <ShaunKing> NFL teams have made the choice that they'd rather lose before even giving Colin Kaepernick a workout for a backup quarterback position.

915321438936162306 2017-10-03 21:03:31 UTC <ShaunKing> I spoke w/ several close personal friends of Colin Kaepernick over the past hour.   This move by the @Titans clearly stung them deeply.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/915313515707224065
915320598154313728 2017-10-03 21:00:11 UTC <ShaunKing> Colin Kaepernick has the second lowest interception percentage in @NFL history.   He's that accurate. Has been his entire career.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/915316135603646466

915313515707224065 2017-10-03 20:32:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Colin Kaepernicks worst season was better than Brandon Weedens best.   He never started a single playoff game.  This isnt about football.

915303011316051969 2017-10-03 19:50:18 UTC <ShaunKing> At this point I think Colin Kaepernick has a legal argument for workplace discrimination. Its outrageous. He is clearly a better option.https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/915273983590727680
915293270133104640 2017-10-03 19:11:35 UTC <ShaunKing> Simply outrageous. If you dont see that Colin Kaepernick has been effectively banned from the league you arent paying attention.https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/915273983590727680

915273356575899648 2017-10-03 17:52:27 UTC <ShaunKing> @cvaldary I am pointing to the hypocrisy. And to the roots of it.
915272197735944192 2017-10-03 17:47:51 UTC <ShaunKing> If the majority of mass shootings in America were committed by Black men, most white men would assume a connection rooted in Blackness.
915271941866565632 2017-10-03 17:46:50 UTC <ShaunKing> I sincerely think it is difficult for (white) America to push for answers on why so many white men kill so many people in mass shootings.
915271349647618048 2017-10-03 17:44:29 UTC <ShaunKing> If 1,000 Muslim men committed mass shootings in America, and did each alone, Islam would be blamed and they would not be called lone wolves.
915270869253009408 2017-10-03 17:42:34 UTC <ShaunKing> My inbox is full of white people defending the Las Vegas shooter.  Mainly saying he was mentally ill.   He wasn't.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/915004800831549440
915270080065425408 2017-10-03 17:39:26 UTC <ShaunKing> The amount of vulgar hate mail I have received from my latest article confirms for me that I was right. That's my greatest barometer.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/915004800831549440
915269243507179520 2017-10-03 17:36:07 UTC <ShaunKing> 24 hours later this tweet looks even more irresponsible and ridiculous than it did in all of the hysteria.https://twitter.com/AP/status/914856906346377216

915015992178298881 2017-10-02 00:49:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Had the shooter been a Muslim, conservatives would be on TV at this very moment proposing multi-billion dollar solutions & measures & wars.
915011117566619649 2017-10-02 00:30:25 UTC <ShaunKing> Where is the conservative anger?   Conservatives STAY angry.  No single American has shot & killed more people than this man.  But no anger.
915010782215188480 2017-10-02 00:29:05 UTC <ShaunKing> Every single reasonable person in the world knows that Trump would be LIVID, and on a constant tweet storm, had this not been a white man.

914963376471756801 2017-10-02 21:20:42 UTC <ShaunKing> It should be fully legalized.   Decriminalization is a good start though.   My understanding is that the City Council approved this 15-0.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/914962988469248001

914838174878326784 2017-10-02 13:03:12 UTC <ShaunKing> @bryanmichaelcox Right. The investigation hasn't even started yet man.
914836619986968577 2017-10-02 12:57:01 UTC <ShaunKing> According to early reports, Stephen Paddock was armed with at least 8 different assault rifles and long guns.   America.
914836283184336897 2017-10-02 12:55:41 UTC <ShaunKing> So far at least 406 people have been taken to Las Vegas hospitals with injuries from the mass shooting.

914817213458206720 2017-10-02 11:39:54 UTC <ShaunKing> I vehemently disagree with anyone saying that now is not the time to discuss how we best prevent such things from happening. Of course it is

913896973345968128 2017-09-29 22:43:12 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. Police, in a ridiculous PR stunt, have now released body camera footage from AFTER the arrest. By then, they knew he was an NFL STAR.

913476693444251648 2017-09-28 18:53:09 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 10. Now, as a Louisiana High School violates the Constitution to force students to stand during the anthem, they walked right into a trap.
913476518520803328 2017-09-28 18:52:28 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 9. On Monday, when a Wisconsin restaurant owner began advocating that NFL players who take a knee be KILLED, he exposed their true heart.
913476361716666368 2017-09-28 18:51:50 UTC <ShaunKing> 8. On Monday, when the Director of the Michigan State Police said @NFL players hate America and are ingrate degenerates, she exposed herself
913476192677883904 2017-09-28 18:51:10 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 7. On Sunday, when the white fire chief said he put Mike Tomlin on the "list of no-good niggers" - he exposed what was REALLY going on.
913476003435024385 2017-09-28 18:50:25 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 6. On Friday when Trump called PEACEFUL protestors sons of bitches, he completely gave up any argument for the moral high ground.
913475815584694272 2017-09-28 18:49:40 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 5. On last Friday, Trump fell right into a trap calling players sons of bitches. His bigoted followers, just as expected, have followed suit
913475586135379968 2017-09-28 18:48:45 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 4. What was undeniable was that those who are fighting against Civil Rights were cruel, ugly, racist, mean-spirited, violent bigots.
913475434301534209 2017-09-28 18:48:09 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 3. As the nation looked on, at water hoses & dogs unleashed on kids, as freedom riders had their bus bombed, as 4 little girls were killed..
913475211126886400 2017-09-28 18:47:16 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 2. Dr. King & others knew, that if protestors could be peaceful, calm, and non-violent, it would expose the racist bigots for who they are.
913475047486050309 2017-09-28 18:46:37 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 1. The strategy of peaceful, non-violent resistance in the Civil Rights Movement had many inspirations & outcomes. Let me highlight ONE.
913474178988339200 2017-09-28 18:43:10 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.

913091711043198976 2017-09-27 17:23:22 UTC <ShaunKing> A lot of Black folk with white pastors are learning that their pastors pretty much side with Trump on protests.  http://www.charismanews.com/politics/issues/67447-megachurch-pastor-sparks-social-media-rage-with-protest-comments
913073448569626625 2017-09-27 16:10:48 UTC <ShaunKing> Like outlines of dead bodies, Missouri bar owner puts Kaepernick & Marshawn Lynch jerseys out as doormats.http://www.komu.com/news/lake-ozark-bar-criticized-for-nfl-jersey-doormat-seen-as-racist
913061126979637248 2017-09-27 15:21:51 UTC <ShaunKing> I had a man who served hard time for murder tell me he knew many murderers who were just like Ray. Weirdly overcompensating for their past.
913060635369500677 2017-09-27 15:19:53 UTC <ShaunKing> It's wild that sports journalists keep speaking to Ray Lewis like this man is a moral authority of some kind. His morality is a myth.

913018687745134592 2017-09-27 12:33:12 UTC <ShaunKing> I grew up on Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, & DefJam. Learned most of what I know about public speaking/stage control from stand up comedians.

913012019284074496 2017-09-27 12:06:42 UTC <ShaunKing> She needs to be fired.   The chief law enforcement officer of that state shouldn't call anyone what she called these men.https://twitter.com/freep/status/912996294527819776

912379196428742659 2017-09-25 18:12:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 13. How can @NFL owners & executives repudiate from Trump what they've already done, and continue to do, to Colin Kaepernick???  //End.
912378885853138944 2017-09-25 18:10:52 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 12. What Trump said was OUTRAGEOUS, but he is the Frankenstein created by @NFL owners.   They made him. They funded him. They set the tone.pic.twitter.com/xSGmwx1nmM
912378330145574912 2017-09-25 18:08:39 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 11. Ask @mikefreemanNFL - one @NFL executive told him 6 months ago that teams would attempt to make an example of Colin Kaepernick.
912377651725324289 2017-09-25 18:05:57 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL @theintercept 10. What Trump said owners should do to players who take a knee, THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE to Colin Kaepernick.   He didn't propose a new idea.
912377478492061696 2017-09-25 18:05:16 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL @theintercept And here's my final point.....
912377308564021248 2017-09-25 18:04:36 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 9. It was CRAZY to hear the President, on the mic, at a rally, call @NFL players SONS OF BITCHES, but his owner buddies said it before him.
912376934218248193 2017-09-25 18:03:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 8. One @NFL executive said he would "quit his job first" if an owner asked him to hire Kaepernick.  Sounds like baseball before integration.
912376661127122949 2017-09-25 18:02:01 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 7. He has no respect for our country. Fuck that guy.   -An @NFL Executive speaking about Colin Kaepernick.
912376386870026241 2017-09-25 18:00:56 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL @theintercept 6. Seven GM's told @mikefreemanNFL they thought 90-95% of GM's hated Colin Kaepernick's guts.   READ THIS.  They said GM's "won't move on."pic.twitter.com/5CSqtGNsTy
912375813676421121 2017-09-25 17:58:39 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 5. Another @NFL Executive said Kaepernick was the most hated man BY GM'S since Rae Carruth - WHO HAD HIS PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND KILLED.
912375420808454145 2017-09-25 17:57:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 4. Another @NFL Executive, speaking of Colin Kaepernick, called him a "TRAITOR."http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2651681-mike-freemans-10-point-stance-kaepernick-anger-intense-in-nfl-front-offices
912375290709635074 2017-09-25 17:56:35 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 3. Speaking to @mikefreemanNFL - one @NFL Executive, speaking of Colin Kaepenrick said "FUCK THAT GUY."  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2651681-mike-freemans-10-point-stance-kaepernick-anger-intense-in-nfl-front-offices
912375001357144065 2017-09-25 17:55:26 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept 2. LONG before @realDonaldTrump called @NFL players SONS OF BITCHES, @NFL owners & GM's were ALREADY saying that about Colin Kaepernick.
912374718887600128 2017-09-25 17:54:18 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept THREAD.  1. Yesterday was beautiful. I'm amazingly proud of the @NFL players who protested & demonstrated.   But some hypocrisy is afoot.

912368012077993985 2017-09-25 17:27:39 UTC <ShaunKing> @theintercept Many of the @NFL owners who pretended to have beef w/ Trump yesterday are simply performance artists & hypocrites.https://theintercept.com/2017/09/25/colin-kaepernick-nfl-national-anthem-protest-donald-trump/

912324801389371392 2017-09-25 14:35:57 UTC <ShaunKing> They are playing with words. No player told me that. I never said that. Players told me theyd be on a shit list if they took a knee.https://twitter.com/fishsports/status/912319798381391872

912139485500014592 2017-09-24 02:19:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Jacob Scott Goodwin, it was you who first assaulted DeAndre Harris and nearly knocked him out, knocking him to the ground to be mauled.
912139232411635712 2017-09-24 02:18:34 UTC <ShaunKing> And we noticed on Facebook that you actually admitted this was you and explained where you bought the shield and gear (flea market).pic.twitter.com/sYyaNG55VU
912138912616865792 2017-09-24 02:17:18 UTC <ShaunKing> So, you left your Facebook page up.   https://www.facebook.com/jacob.goodwin.3388  And we saw your mother's page and all of the pages for your family & friends
912138433002397696 2017-09-24 02:15:23 UTC <ShaunKing> But most of all, Jacob Scott Goodwin, we knew your long red hair would help us find you.  We saw it under your helmet in Charlottesville.pic.twitter.com/kxYrgwWPIk

912114550954168320 2017-09-24 00:40:29 UTC <ShaunKing> Fans who were there messaged me that they heard people yelling "FUCK YOU" & "Stand up Assholes" to the players sitting DURING THE ANTHEM.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/912112635860176896
912113050420957185 2017-09-24 00:34:32 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL @rolandsmartin They did indeed
912112635860176896 2017-09-24 00:32:53 UTC <ShaunKing> The Oakland Raiders.pic.twitter.com/HyNepLpxxi
912112002541203456 2017-09-24 00:30:22 UTC <ShaunKing> 40+ Raiders are sitting for the National Anthem right now.
912091816245252096 2017-09-24 23:10:09 UTC <ShaunKing> Let me tell you some of what's going on here.   Trump is an attention whore. He desperately wants the NFL protests & boycott to be about HIM
912091469447614464 2017-09-24 23:08:46 UTC <ShaunKing> From a leading organization of VETERANS. https://twitter.com/votevets/status/911747384887140353
912069305545773057 2017-09-24 21:40:42 UTC <ShaunKing> Several players from teams that decided to not even come out for the National Anthem told me they did not want that.
912066873243598850 2017-09-24 21:31:02 UTC <ShaunKing> One of my heroes, @ShakaSenghor, on Ray Lewis. I agree.pic.twitter.com/iNGqQPlvkj
912065860298305536 2017-09-24 21:27:01 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump is generally full of shit. We dont make any decisions with his thinking in mind.https://twitter.com/mattminerxvx/status/912065126999773190
912055062209449989 2017-09-24 20:44:06 UTC <ShaunKing> Again - to the owners of the NFL - what did Donald Trump say that you haven't already lived out by preventing Kaepernick from playing?
912054613238599680 2017-09-24 20:42:19 UTC <ShaunKing> Colin Kaepernick is still unemployed.   It's widely accepted that his unemployment has nothing to do with football.   The boycott continues.
912054242193666048 2017-09-24 20:40:51 UTC <ShaunKing> Thank you Julius.   Watch this.https://twitter.com/PanthersBill/status/912049423684861953
912048883638964225 2017-09-24 20:19:33 UTC <ShaunKing> I've seen white fans across the league today boo & yell at silent Black men during the anthem.   This isn't patriotism. It's racism. Period.
912047826401681408 2017-09-24 20:15:21 UTC <ShaunKing> Not a single player from the Titans or the Seahawks participated in the National Anthem just now.pic.twitter.com/yskxkpFYL0
912046784800796672 2017-09-24 20:11:13 UTC <ShaunKing> They don't actually care about the National Anthem. They talk & boo & ignore it.  They just want to make sure the niggers are compliant.https://twitter.com/RockpileReport/status/911998726599737344
912046123468169218 2017-09-24 20:08:35 UTC <ShaunKing> @Freeyourmindkid They finally got specific man

912044100156878848 2017-09-24 20:00:33 UTC <ShaunKing> A fresh round of players in the upcoming games have communicated to me that they will be demonstrating as well.
912043818228297728 2017-09-24 19:59:25 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump, speaking on a mic before the world, in front of a crowd of 7,500, called the mothers of @NFL players taking a knee "bitch"
912043480981090304 2017-09-24 19:58:05 UTC <ShaunKing> My friend Judah - a white Christian pastor, speaking up for his friend, Michael Bennett.   I respect these two men a great deal.https://twitter.com/judahsmith/status/911789915398012928
912042677973274624 2017-09-24 19:54:54 UTC <ShaunKing> The Seattle Seahawks just made the clearest statement yet of any team.  The whole team is refusing to participate in the Anthem.https://twitter.com/seahawkspr/status/912038744408166401

912041172608176129 2017-09-24 19:48:55 UTC <ShaunKing> Today, and everyday, we stand in solidarity with our indigenous sisters & brothers who are objectified & mocked every day by the @NFL & @MLB
912040824984219653 2017-09-24 19:47:32 UTC <ShaunKing> We call him "Shield."  He was the first person to attack DeAndre Harris in Charlottesville.   Knocked him semi-conscious.   We've ID'd him.pic.twitter.com/ePWPCCMXoy
912039925914234881 2017-09-24 19:43:57 UTC <ShaunKing> The women of the @LA_Sparks left the floor to go back to the locker room for the National Anthem just now.   Game 1 of the WNBA finals.
912039398354620417 2017-09-24 19:41:52 UTC <ShaunKing> By tonight we think we will have a positive ID on one of the most vicious Neo-Nazis who assaulted DeAndre Harris. 99% sure already.
912039166795448322 2017-09-24 19:40:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Today, instead of watching these games, I'm working with a smart team of volunteers to identify white supremacists from Charlottesville.
912038410352721920 2017-09-24 19:37:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Hey Trump,  Is this World War II veteran a son of a bitch for taking a knee today?https://twitter.com/brennanmgilmore/status/911960316220764160

912035893090902017 2017-09-24 19:27:56 UTC <ShaunKing> A player from the Cowboys just made it clear to me that they've all gotten the message that taking a knee will put them "on the shit list"
912035660277665792 2017-09-24 19:27:00 UTC <ShaunKing> Cops in the age of Trump are assaulting grandmothers and leading chants that they "own" the streets.https://twitter.com/Will_Bunch/status/912033311937171456

912028683493310470 2017-09-24 18:59:17 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @NFL Players Locking Arms,  Trump sees you locking arms & loves it.   Whatever message you're intending to send isn't getting through.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912018945158402049
912026032252874752 2017-09-24 18:48:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Players from the @nyjets told me they were directly discouraged from taking a knee.   The owner is a political appointee of Donald Trump.

911980367053312000 2017-09-24 15:47:17 UTC <ShaunKing> DO NOT WATCH THE GAMES.   Period.  Teams will want to use today as MARKETING to get back your viewership.   Dont fall for it.
911974977339092992 2017-09-24 15:25:52 UTC <ShaunKing> All I can tell you is this...  More athletes will demonstrate/protest in a few minutes than have ever done so in American sports.

911965057784909824 2017-09-24 14:46:27 UTC <ShaunKing> Colin,  We love you brother. You should be playing today, but you are on the field in another way. Your boldness started this.
911964462353088512 2017-09-24 14:44:05 UTC <ShaunKing> Spoke to several players prepping for games today. What the bold players did for the Jaguars and Ravens gave them great courage.

911960025844846592 2017-09-24 14:26:28 UTC <ShaunKing> Several players have told me their teams are considering every player taking a knee, but that white players dont feel comfortable.
911958270763524097 2017-09-24 14:19:29 UTC <ShaunKing> No.  I am not watching anything from the @NFL. Not even highlights.  Social media updates only.  The boycott continues.   Dont be tricked.

911954578635190272 2017-09-24 14:04:49 UTC <ShaunKing> To be clear, they are not just in random unity. They are unified against the hate speech of Trump and against injustice in America.https://twitter.com/nflnetwork/status/911948699235893249
911953232817262592 2017-09-24 13:59:28 UTC <ShaunKing> 27 players and staff took a knee this morning from the Jaguars and Ravens.   Most ever in one game.pic.twitter.com/Fv4rra9QJb

911583691746443267 2017-09-23 13:31:03 UTC <ShaunKing> Nothing about being in your presence is an honor. Being in your presence is an insult. You are a disgrace to the Office.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/911572182060453893

911434728791842816 2017-09-22 03:39:07 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump is a shameful white supremacist bigot.  He is violent.  He is vulgar.  He is dangerous.  He is despicable.

911425505727049729 2017-09-22 03:02:28 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @NFL Players,  You have POWER.   You are only scratching the surface of it.   USE IT.   You will regret it if you don't.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/911418854856970241
911422112912543745 2017-09-22 02:48:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Between the revelation that Aaron Hernandez had advanced brain damage after 3 years in the league & Trump's comments, the @NFL is losing.
911421078429425664 2017-09-22 02:44:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Listen to me.  Trump's own father was arrested supporting the KKK in his own version of a Charlottesville Riot nearly 100 years ago.   ROOTS
911420521031634944 2017-09-22 02:42:40 UTC <ShaunKing> @thrasherxy My thoughts exactly
911420246774439936 2017-09-22 02:41:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Speaking in Alabama, calling on his KKK heritage, it feels like Trump wanted say "get the niggers off the field"https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/911404198809493504
911418854856970241 2017-09-22 02:36:02 UTC <ShaunKing> Read the transcript from Trump's racist rant on Black players in the NFL.   It's WAY worse than I thought.pic.twitter.com/WbbUEZvVgr

911416258368811008 2017-09-22 02:25:43 UTC <ShaunKing> Since we are speaking about white supremacists, I want these two men know that we are VERY close to identifying them.   We will not stop.pic.twitter.com/o639Uurqwf
911415258539020293 2017-09-22 02:21:45 UTC <ShaunKing> I just spoke to the @NFLPA.   They are going to respond to this foolishness from Trump.   Players are FURIOUS.
911411505953984513 2017-09-22 02:06:50 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @NFL,  We are putting you on the clock right now to repudiate these comments.   Trump will only make our boycott stronger.
911411222347747328 2017-09-22 02:05:43 UTC <ShaunKing> No - let me be clear.  Who Trump was talking about just now were Black men. Period.   White men protest daily - he has never cursed them outhttps://twitter.com/Jazzy_JAC/status/911409503287021574

911410683677470720 2017-09-22 02:03:34 UTC <ShaunKing> If you ever thought Trump had hit rock bottom, that he couldn't get any lower, just keep on living. He's a disgusting human being.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/911404198809493504
911408677650882560 2017-09-22 01:55:36 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL Dear @MoneyLynch,  Please, for the people, sit during the anthem, dance on the sidelines, and grab your balls during a touchdown this week.
911408503088132096 2017-09-22 01:54:54 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL I am calling on EVERY professional athlete, coach, GM, owner, current & retired, to speak out directly against what Trump just said.
911408072949714945 2017-09-22 01:53:12 UTC <ShaunKing> At the root of Trump's hatred for Obama is the same thing as his hatred for Kaepernick.  He despises Black men w/ power he doesn't give them
911407605867778048 2017-09-22 01:51:21 UTC <ShaunKing> @mr_jasonjones I know Jason. A mess man.
911407352083034112 2017-09-22 01:50:20 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @NFL Players.   Please don't allow this man to strike an ounce of fear in your heart.   Take a knee. Raise a fist. Take a seat.   DO IT
911407106380697601 2017-09-22 01:49:21 UTC <ShaunKing> Every single player, period.   All of them.https://twitter.com/Fizzhogg/status/911407017838862336
911406862809157633 2017-09-22 01:48:23 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump's hate for Colin Kaepernick, a free Black man, has EVERYTHING to do with why Colin is not in the league right now. EVERYTHING.
911406316219981824 2017-09-22 01:46:13 UTC <ShaunKing> Absolutely.   Repeatedly, viciously, violently - he has come for Colin Kaepernick again and again.   While bullshitting on Nazis.https://twitter.com/MichaelSkolnik/status/911403938238337027
911405929484124160 2017-09-22 01:44:41 UTC <ShaunKing> Don't tell me shit about what Jemele Hill said.   Trump tonight did just use a racist dog whistle. He didn't speak in code.  It was flagrant
911405638458146816 2017-09-22 01:43:31 UTC <ShaunKing> Don't tell me shit about what Jemele Hill said.   This man just cursed out Black men.  This man openly encouraged Police Brutality.
911405309167570945 2017-09-22 01:42:13 UTC <ShaunKing> What Donald Trump just did, as the sitting President of the United States, speaking that way about Black men, endangers all Black men.
911405122344939521 2017-09-22 01:41:28 UTC <ShaunKing> Real talk  Donald Trump is a white supremacist.  After cursing Black men he OPENLY said from the mic tonight "I feel like I'm from Alabama."
911404198809493504 2017-09-22 01:37:48 UTC <ShaunKing> The very moment Trump calls Black NFL players "son of a bitch" and yells that they should be fired.   Absolutely disgusting.pic.twitter.com/i8nXlZVcLp
911394957298192384 2017-09-22 01:01:05 UTC <ShaunKing> Very revealing that the harshest language Trump has ever used as President was reserved for Black men protesting injustice.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/911392456561844225
911394033116819456 2017-09-22 00:57:25 UTC <ShaunKing> When was the last time a sitting President said son of a bitch on purpose at a rally?   Has that ever happened?  Its VERY telling.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/911392456561844225
911393609416572934 2017-09-22 00:55:44 UTC <ShaunKing> After this, he went on a riff about how all NFL players not standing for the Anthem should be fired. Then yelled Hes Fired to the crowd.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/911392456561844225
911392456561844225 2017-09-22 00:51:09 UTC <ShaunKing> TRUMP: Wouldn't you like to see one of our NFL owners, when somebody disrepects the flag, say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field..."
911390825287995393 2017-09-22 00:44:40 UTC <ShaunKing> They are still chanting about lock her up at Trumps rallies and he is playing along.   I so badly want Karma to get this man.https://twitter.com/aseitzwald/status/911385292946407424

910989937956270082 2017-09-21 22:11:41 UTC <ShaunKing> @BobJone02265760 @iproposethis Absolutely
910972455635836930 2017-09-21 21:02:13 UTC <ShaunKing> Translation: The brain of Aaron Hernandez had dead spots and was torn up. https://twitter.com/lindseyadler/status/910959563507150848
910971598479527937 2017-09-21 20:58:48 UTC <ShaunKing> @VanessaFordDC Please send it my way
910971189270589440 2017-09-21 20:57:11 UTC <ShaunKing> @DonteStallworth Right Donte. The best.
910970883992379398 2017-09-21 20:55:58 UTC <ShaunKing> WWE Star Chris Benoit had advanced CTE.   Killed his entire family and himself.
910970378465488897 2017-09-21 20:53:57 UTC <ShaunKing> Some studies are showing that KIDS.  Let me pause right there....  KIDS.  In middle school & high school...  have CTE from football.
910969495124144128 2017-09-21 20:50:27 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. It's why non-football sports (and non sports activities) are exploding in higher zip code areas.
910969320871792641 2017-09-21 20:49:45 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. It's why LeBron James openly said he won't let his sons play football.   (LeBron was a football star by the way)
910969203368300544 2017-09-21 20:49:17 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. So, what we're going to be seeing is the NFL increasingly being made up of   a. Players of Color b. Rural whites
910968985256112128 2017-09-21 20:48:25 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. Many wealthy counties across the country have actually cut football programs altogether. BECAUSE OF HEALTH RISKS.
910968874518159362 2017-09-21 20:47:59 UTC <ShaunKing> Thread.   1. Have you seen the studies showing that the poorer the zip code the higher the rate of football play?   They are damning.
910968555268698112 2017-09-21 20:46:43 UTC <ShaunKing> @mikefreemanNFL I agree Mike.
910968343011774465 2017-09-21 20:45:52 UTC <ShaunKing> Indeed. https://twitter.com/MatthewACherry/status/910967746522841088
910967866853294080 2017-09-21 20:43:59 UTC <ShaunKing> @courtneyknorris indeed.
910967720010756097 2017-09-21 20:43:24 UTC <ShaunKing> @billmckibben It's awful man.
910967584027226113 2017-09-21 20:42:51 UTC <ShaunKing> I've had recently retired brothers from the NFL tell me they can't get through a basic conversation properly anymore - so they withdraw.
910967318313881600 2017-09-21 20:41:48 UTC <ShaunKing> If you don't want to accept what CTE did to Aaron Hernandez & Lawrence Phillips - just research Junior Seau.   You can start & end there.
910967051786887169 2017-09-21 20:40:44 UTC <ShaunKing> Last week I spoke to the mother of Lawrence Phillips. He also had severe CTE.   It ruined him.   Again, this is brain damage.
910966465884512256 2017-09-21 20:38:25 UTC <ShaunKing> I strongly disagree.   The man had severe brain damage. It affects your ability to make smart decisions & understand real world consequenceshttps://twitter.com/rhyme_writer/status/910965119865167872
910964771465375744 2017-09-21 20:31:41 UTC <ShaunKing> Some headlines incorrectly say "Lawyers for Aaron Hernandez say he had CTE."  The best researchers in the world found he had advanced CTE.
910964091518423040 2017-09-21 20:28:58 UTC <ShaunKing> Heartbreaking.   I've had nearly 20 NFL families contact me whose loved ones were destroyed by CTE.https://twitter.com/NYTSports/status/910957134216679424

909819620479168512 2017-09-18 16:41:15 UTC <ShaunKing> @TerryMcAuliffe I spoke to this woman who was assaulted earlier today.   She said NOBODY from the police department even spoke to her about this. A mess.pic.twitter.com/DXza24zPGm
909819010191183873 2017-09-18 16:38:50 UTC <ShaunKing> @TerryMcAuliffe Seriously though - Democrats often show up at Black churches and talk about what they care about - then do a bunch of nothing. Infuriating.
909818625661513729 2017-09-18 16:37:18 UTC <ShaunKing> @TerryMcAuliffe It took me and a scrappy group of volunteers about 5 days to properly identify & locate Michael Alex Ramos.   Police should've done this.pic.twitter.com/69KS4e0SvD
909818454722715649 2017-09-18 16:36:37 UTC <ShaunKing> @TerryMcAuliffe It took me & scrappy group of volunteers 3 days to find Dan Borden.   Why are we being forced to bring people to justice ourselves?pic.twitter.com/K6amKFZlTX

909817611940179968 2017-09-18 16:33:16 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @TerryMcAuliffe,  If Virginia is taking white supremacists so damn seriously - why are we crowdsourcing justice for victims ourselves?
909812653526265861 2017-09-18 16:13:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Simple facts from @SouhanStrib   On how the evidence that teams need Colin Kaepernick is overwhelming at this point  http://www.startribune.com/a-year-after-bold-move-for-sam-bradford-vikings-could-have-used-colin-kaepernick-as-backup/445174023/pic.twitter.com/H8ASumXqOU
909810989805309953 2017-09-18 16:06:58 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL "The Vikings and other teams decided that they prefer comfortable losses to uneasy victories."

909809628921331714 2017-09-18 16:01:33 UTC <ShaunKing> I just read what I think might be the most compelling article ever written on Colin Kaepernick being blacklisted from the @NFL.   One second
909806255044268032 2017-09-18 15:48:09 UTC <ShaunKing> Unlike the @NFL - I predict this year that the ratings for the @NBA will be through the roof. A record year for the league.

909493024920662018 2017-09-17 19:03:29 UTC <ShaunKing> Quarterbacks across the @NFL are literally setting records for their horrible gameplay, but Kaepernick still doesn't have a job.
909489021872689153 2017-09-17 18:47:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Sooooooooo many teams would be better with Colin Kaepernick at Quarterback.  Cardinals, Bears, Browns, Vikings, Jets - I'm looking at you.
909474999026806785 2017-09-17 17:51:51 UTC <ShaunKing> Turns out Trump some of the accounts Trump retweeted today are Neo-Nazis.  They identify with one another so much. A natural partnership.

908877232323596288 2017-09-15 02:16:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Here, I called Trump a white supremacist bigot two weeks ago. I called him one 6 months and almost 2 years ago.  It's just true.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/904527762895069188
908875579960815616 2017-09-15 02:09:59 UTC <ShaunKing> @ZachGelb Email me. In my bio. Again, I see him saying clearly that he wouldn't in those quotes. Take care man.
908867790119096320 2017-09-15 01:39:01 UTC <ShaunKing> He is a member of @TradWorker. He has traveled throughout the South with them in Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, and elsewhere.https://twitter.com/MuslimIQ/status/908769152512544770
908867362048245760 2017-09-15 01:37:19 UTC <ShaunKing> I believe we will have this man identified in just a few days. We know where he has lived. We know his friends, former addresses. Crimes.https://twitter.com/MuslimIQ/status/908769152512544770
908864751039545344 2017-09-15 01:26:57 UTC <ShaunKing> @ZachGelb When I read those quotes, I'm deeply bothered. When Malcolm read them, he saw something different. You, something different, Etc.
908864417558917121 2017-09-15 01:25:37 UTC <ShaunKing> @ZachGelb I did. And I say this with certainty because I tried what I'm about to say - 10 people read those quotes & get 10 different meanings.
908863877001003008 2017-09-15 01:23:28 UTC <ShaunKing> He should never be booked on a national television show. He publicly said Lebron James staged a hate crime at his own house. He's a bigot.https://twitter.com/seankent/status/908787379263094784
908863355078582274 2017-09-15 01:21:24 UTC <ShaunKing> @ZachGelb I did read the quotes. I still have several problems with what Lurie said. Are you an Eagles fan? I ask objectively. It affects this issue.

908848458462883847 2017-09-15 00:22:12 UTC <ShaunKing> While I was still troubled by some of what I read, Malcolm & I agreed that a local reporter willfully misrepresented Lurie in an article.https://twitter.com/malcolmjenkins/status/908818051017080832
908848045995028481 2017-09-15 00:20:34 UTC <ShaunKing> I spoke with Malcolm about this & came away believing that Lurie had at least been genuinely supportive of him.https://twitter.com/malcolmjenkins/status/908818051017080832

908469843191410688 2017-09-14 23:17:43 UTC <ShaunKing> No, they aren't. Not at all. Your team owner called Kaepernick disrespectful & said that lost him. But Cooper calling people niggers didn't.https://twitter.com/eagles/status/908374746085150720
908469287462912001 2017-09-14 23:15:31 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles My point is this: Riley Cooper calling Black folk niggers didn't "lose" your team owner but here he says Kaepernick's protests did.
908469079937212416 2017-09-14 23:14:41 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles Clearly you read that quote and hear something different than I do. He compared Kaepernick to Vick and said his protests "lost" him.

908359456894930944 2017-09-14 15:59:05 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles I've seen Colin daily be compared to criminals and men who've murdered and maimed and raped - and for him to keep his cool & keep doing good
908359130380939264 2017-09-14 15:57:47 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles I've seen Colin try to track down exactly how much money his jersey sales are making so that he can be sure to give every cent to charity.
908358878219382786 2017-09-14 15:56:47 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles Colin is perhaps the most meticulous and organized athlete I've ever worked with. And he does so with a peaceful grace & warmth & kindness.
908358701953798156 2017-09-14 15:56:05 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles And stop this foolishness about Colin protesting and not having a plan. You just don't know the plan because you don't care to know it.
908358544143122432 2017-09-14 15:55:28 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles I've directly connected Colin w/ families affected by police brutality and been there when he called them to console them and send his love.
908358344875933696 2017-09-14 15:54:40 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles I've gotten the texts from Colin asking, "Shaun, who is on the ground protecting immigrants. What do they need? How can I help?"
908358143188639744 2017-09-14 15:53:52 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles I've seen Colin Kaepernick study hundreds of grassroots charities in America to evaluate how he can best support their work on the ground.
908357855488724992 2017-09-14 15:52:43 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles I've seen 500 kids sit silently and attentively for HOURS as they learned about their history, health, finances, and more @yourrightscamp
908357652534702080 2017-09-14 15:51:55 UTC <ShaunKing> I'd encourage @Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie to be in a room full of children when Colin Kapernick walks into it.   He is a deep HERO to them.
908357422531727361 2017-09-14 15:51:00 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles When my 10 year old son & I attended Colin's first @yourrightscamp - he was up past 2am, during a bi-week, packing book bags for kids.
908357164225490944 2017-09-14 15:49:59 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles Colin Kaepernick has hosted camps for kids across the country to give them the skills & encouragement they need. He plans & manages them.
908357014170095616 2017-09-14 15:49:23 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles Colin Kaepernick has met directly with police officers who are deeply disturbed by police brutality and want to change the system.
908356828626608133 2017-09-14 15:48:39 UTC <ShaunKing> @Eagles For those of us who work closely w/ Kaepernick - he's not just writing checks - he has just chosen not to be a media whore with his service.
908356465790001152 2017-09-14 15:47:12 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @Eagles,  Your owner - Jeffrey Lurie - has ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what he's talking about concerning Colin here.http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/colin-kaepernick-jeffrey-lurie-philadelphia-eagles-social-injustice-anthem-protest-20170913.html
908356293210943488 2017-09-14 15:46:31 UTC <ShaunKing> It's amazing the @Eagles owner found it in his heart to have grace for a white player calling Black folk niggers - draws the line w/ Colin.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/908352933632376833
908355539519852546 2017-09-14 15:43:31 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @Eagles,  I fundamentally reject the deeply offensive way Jeffrey Lurie characterized Colin Kaepernick's activism over this past year.
908353393126756352 2017-09-14 15:34:59 UTC <ShaunKing> REMINDER: "I will fight every nigger here." - Eagles WR Riley Cooper  Given grace and a pass from Eagles ownership.http://deadspin.com/eagles-wr-riley-cooper-at-concert-i-will-fight-every-979470075
908352933632376833 2017-09-14 15:33:10 UTC <ShaunKing> The owner of the Eagles said he wouldn't hire Colin because of his anthem protest, but hired a white player who called black people "nigger"
908346955994148866 2017-09-14 15:09:25 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL Tennis ratings were up 16%. NFL ratings were down 13%.
908345478517022722 2017-09-14 15:03:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Ratings for College Football and the US Open were UP this weekend.   The @NFL can lie & blame the storm for the ratings slump. It's not true
908344006257627136 2017-09-14 14:57:41 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 3. This is also about you. If a superstar can be pushed out of his career in the prime of his life for speaking out on injustice, so can you
908343320966987776 2017-09-14 14:54:58 UTC <ShaunKing> @NFL 2. We have at least crossed the point where people have stopped saying the NFL's ban of Colin is about football. It isn't. Period.
908342725837295617 2017-09-14 14:52:36 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. I refuse to allow the @NFL to effectively ban Colin Kaepernick from the league for his peaceful stance against injustice.

906222750037139459 2017-09-08 18:28:35 UTC <ShaunKing> Dear @NFL,  I won't be watching a single game this year. What you've done to Kaepernick is inexcusable  #NFLBoycotthttps://medium.com/@ShaunKing/together-lets-boycott-the-nfl-fb3c1356d71c

906185613602369540 2017-09-08 16:01:01 UTC <ShaunKing> Making an announcement in about an hour.
906182211208171520 2017-09-08 15:47:29 UTC <ShaunKing> @NBCNewYork @SarahWallace4NY You all are doing a great job.
906181486285553667 2017-09-08 15:44:37 UTC <ShaunKing> @RealGigiWilson @mstark61 Exactly.
906180605360123904 2017-09-08 15:41:06 UTC <ShaunKing> @jonhumbert I'm sure she does. But again, do not use the very recent murder of someone as the intro to sell your product.
906180423310610433 2017-09-08 15:40:23 UTC <ShaunKing> @sarah_haskins @TheWayWithAnoa @citizenstewart Even if the Broadway and Mystery novel piece was there, without the request to purchase overpriced tour tickets, it'd be different.
906175045382365185 2017-09-08 15:19:01 UTC <ShaunKing> @sarah_haskins @citizenstewart @TheWayWithAnoa Agreed.
906175009906982912 2017-09-08 15:18:52 UTC <ShaunKing> @sarah_haskins @citizenstewart Not to sell products it shouldn't
906166802648064001 2017-09-08 14:46:16 UTC <ShaunKing> As a general rule, don't use the very recent murder of any person as an emotional hook to sell any product. It's just that simple.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/906163903792603136
906165839250026496 2017-09-08 14:42:26 UTC <ShaunKing> Let's be clear and honest.   This is a marketing email for a product being sold.   Heather was the emotional hook for the book ticket. Grosshttps://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/906163903792603136
906165619468496896 2017-09-08 14:41:34 UTC <ShaunKing> As a general rule, do not invoke Heather's name as the introduction to your product sales. Period. Doubly so if your product bashes her herohttps://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/906163903792603136
906165126054727680 2017-09-08 14:39:36 UTC <ShaunKing> @sarah_haskins Heather's name should never come as the introduction to a for profit event. Let's be clear, this was an ad to buy tickets to her event.
906164262460116992 2017-09-08 14:36:10 UTC <ShaunKing> What's doubly wild is that Heather was a "Bernie Bro" and organized against corporate politicians.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/906163903792603136
906163903792603136 2017-09-08 14:34:45 UTC <ShaunKing> The gross moment where Hillary Clinton invokes the murder of Heather Heyer to sell tickets for her expensive book tour.  It's not OK.pic.twitter.com/PrbGQcN8tW

905861892140359680 2017-09-07 18:34:39 UTC <ShaunKing> If you are a white liberal/progressive some of what Ta-Nehisi says is going to sting/cut. Please resist your urge to assume he's wrong. https://twitter.com/tanehisicoates/status/905749629471424512
905858805283651585 2017-09-07 18:22:23 UTC <ShaunKing> In some ways I find this highlighted sentence to be the thesis of Ta-Nehisi's essay. Truer words never spoken.  https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/537909/pic.twitter.com/Ekd741dJho
905856503265054721 2017-09-07 18:13:15 UTC <ShaunKing> Ta-Nehisi is spot on right here. Trump absolutely took the very election of Obama as a personal offense.   https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/537909/pic.twitter.com/wXUmeXRCB7

905842631179165696 2017-09-07 17:18:07 UTC <ShaunKing> @RoseAnnDeMoro Absolutely RoseAnn. Progressive women RAN Bernie's campaign and run this movement. Anyone saying otherwise clearly isn't a part of it.
905842294003249156 2017-09-07 17:16:47 UTC <ShaunKing> 9. Thankfully - Senators Warren & Harris are charting a path forward for Democrats alongside Bernie and progressives.  End of Thread.
905841799612293120 2017-09-07 17:14:49 UTC <ShaunKing> 8. I am not at all saying "Be quiet Hillary." That is indeed sexist & condescending. I just strongly disagree with her argument on her loss.
905841503897079809 2017-09-07 17:13:38 UTC <ShaunKing> 7. New polls have Hillary's approval ratings at 30% - her lowest approval rating ever. 4 points lower than Trump.   It will get worse.
905840825325760512 2017-09-07 17:10:57 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. Smart Democrats will find genuine partnerships not just with Bernie, but with progressives on the issues we value the most.
905840280129167360 2017-09-07 17:08:47 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. I'm a part of 9-10 private "Bernie Bro" chat groups  They're made up almost exclusively of women. His most essential supporters are women
905839816100761601 2017-09-07 17:06:56 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. Also, Hillary's revisionist reduction of Bernie's biggest supporters as obnoxious white men erases the reality of who they really are.
905839546885165058 2017-09-07 17:05:52 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. If you write a book blaming Bernie & Obama & Joe Biden for your loss to Trump, stop telling people who respond "now's not the time."
905839212221562882 2017-09-07 17:04:32 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. I'm stumped at how Hillary's most devout supporters claim she's the toughest human being on Earth then treat her like she's fragile glass
905838943844925440 2017-09-07 17:03:28 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. Responding with thoughtful criticism to Hillary Clinton's horrible new blame-book does not make one sexist or even anti-Hillary.
905836579939385345 2017-09-07 16:54:04 UTC <ShaunKing> My best guess is that @SenGillibrand will soon join this bill as a Co-Sponsor.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/905835784091131906
905836066762104832 2017-09-07 16:52:02 UTC <ShaunKing> It may not seem to many of you like it took guts for Harris & Warren to do this, but it did. Corporate Democrats loathe Medicare for All.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/905835784091131906
905835784091131906 2017-09-07 16:50:55 UTC <ShaunKing> Very glad to see @SenKamalaHarris & @SenWarren come together w/ @BernieSanders to co-sponsor & back Medicare for All.   This is progress!
905827471626526720 2017-09-07 16:17:53 UTC <ShaunKing> @martinonyc @buttermilk1 I thought that was already widely accepted and that them acknowledging it was very interesting.

905274786380689409 2017-09-05 03:41:42 UTC <ShaunKing> It's true. Jason Whitlock is utterly obsessed w/ Colin Kaepernick because he has learned that dissing Colin gets him showered w/ white love.https://twitter.com/princehak33m/status/905241344611946496
905272009470431232 2017-09-05 03:30:40 UTC <ShaunKing> @WhitlockJason @EdwinLindo It's gross man.
905270268716883968 2017-09-05 03:23:45 UTC <ShaunKing> Utterly gross to see what Jason Whitlock has become. He's the Black man Fox pays to justify their bigoted wet dreams. It's sad, honestly.https://twitter.com/whitlockjason/status/905233739264868354
905269525758832642 2017-09-05 03:20:48 UTC <ShaunKing> When Whitlock crashed and burned at ESPN, he lost a part of his soul. Before he ever dissed me on air for money, he wrote this stuff.https://twitter.com/whitlockjason/status/523253705026465792
905268974971183106 2017-09-05 03:18:37 UTC <ShaunKing> Before Jason Whitlock sold his soul for money at Fox, before he hated Black Lives Matter & Colin Kaepernick, dude was my biggest fan.https://twitter.com/whitlockjason/status/514829109499682816

902629442408906752 2017-08-29 20:30:03 UTC <ShaunKing> The man has never had to comfort a hurting city before so he simply brags about the number of people he thinks are there to see him.https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/902592363427659776

902562508862513152 2017-08-29 16:04:05 UTC <ShaunKing> Sarah Wallace interviews another witness who was forced by police & prosecutors to lie on Pedro.pic.twitter.com/AxCO62rZkn
902562322916433920 2017-08-29 16:03:21 UTC <ShaunKing> Aaron Prince tragically admits he lied on Pedro after police & prosecutors threatened him with long jail time if he didn't do it.pic.twitter.com/n0lxUn0TlS
902562138677436420 2017-08-29 16:02:37 UTC <ShaunKing> Ramzy on police & prosecutors trying to get him to lie on Pedro - threatening him if he doesn't lie for them.pic.twitter.com/0C4ToEbdmW
902561984922607616 2017-08-29 16:02:00 UTC <ShaunKing> WATCH.   Myshawn on how police & prosecutors tried to force him to lie on Pedro. He doesn't even know who Pedro is.pic.twitter.com/K8o0YpyxiO
902561821453717504 2017-08-29 16:01:21 UTC <ShaunKing> MUST SEE.   The shooting VICTIM, Shaun Nardoni, on police trying to force him to lie to say Pedro shot him. Threatened & beat him.pic.twitter.com/EFl7OHSRCW
902560873109012481 2017-08-29 15:57:35 UTC <ShaunKing> WATCH  Dramane witnessed the shooting of Shaun Nardoni.   He saw the shooter and the gun.   The shooter was Charles "CJ" Holmes. Not Pedro.pic.twitter.com/QGMfuJvYHM
902560591285510144 2017-08-29 15:56:28 UTC <ShaunKing> On July 14th, 2016 Pedro Hernandez was falsely arrested & charged with the shooting of a young kid named Shaun Nardoni  Let me break it down
902560341825126400 2017-08-29 15:55:28 UTC <ShaunKing> First, a recap of all of the fake arrests, fake charges, then dismissals that Pedro experienced before his most recent case.  ASTOUNDING.pic.twitter.com/noZA3SnKDM
902560073867776004 2017-08-29 15:54:25 UTC <ShaunKing> That brings us to Pedro's current case. It's the most despicable injustice I've ever covered in my whole life. Let me break it down.
902559793172373505 2017-08-29 15:53:18 UTC <ShaunKing> Again, now for the 4th time being charged with fake felonies, police dismissed all charges against Pedro.   Here's the dismissal.pic.twitter.com/GG0dJQDTSB
902559058552553472 2017-08-29 15:50:22 UTC <ShaunKing> Here's what's wild.   William Stevens says him, the police, and prosecutors made up this fake robbery attempt to frame Pedro as well.
902558693803397122 2017-08-29 15:48:55 UTC <ShaunKing> Except Pedro was getting a haircut at the time of the robbery. He's on camera. This is his barber filling out an affidavit to these facts.pic.twitter.com/Msv8qy5HVc
902558338138984448 2017-08-29 15:47:31 UTC <ShaunKing> On June 7th, 2016 - police falsely arrest Pedro AGAIN. This time it's for armed robbery. They arrest & jail him for it.
902557927860346881 2017-08-29 15:45:53 UTC <ShaunKing> It's 2016. Pedro is free. Police falsely arrest him for "resisting arrest" & disorderly conduct. Both were lies. Eventually dismissed.pic.twitter.com/pr7ofoYRTt
902557602487394304 2017-08-29 15:44:35 UTC <ShaunKing> The NYPD never charged or arrested anyone else with this attempted murder because it never even happened. William Stevens admits it.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/902557377593004032
902557377593004032 2017-08-29 15:43:42 UTC <ShaunKing> After arresting Pedro for the attempted murder of William Stevens, then arresting, & jailing him, they dismissed all charges 7 months later.pic.twitter.com/oHIwh1s9h1
902556950310920192 2017-08-29 15:42:00 UTC <ShaunKing> Except Pedro had never met William Stephens and had a full alibi for where he was during the staged "murder attempt".
902556749802213376 2017-08-29 15:41:12 UTC <ShaunKing> Working w/ William to create a fake story about Pedro, the NYPD arrested Pedro for the attempted murder of William on March 1st, 2016.
902556105821138944 2017-08-29 15:38:38 UTC <ShaunKing> !!WATCH THIS VIDEO!!  William bravely admits police & prosecutors forced him to lie on dozens of kids in the Bronx - including Pedro.pic.twitter.com/I1sDo1u23v
902555327756992512 2017-08-29 15:35:33 UTC <ShaunKing> Promising they'd leave him alone if he would lie on people for them, William became a false witness for the Bronx DA in dozens of cases.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/902554630638460929
902555089520525312 2017-08-29 15:34:36 UTC <ShaunKing> I met a dozen different people who witnessed police beat, choke & humiliate William all over the neighborhood.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/902554630638460929
902554922469773312 2017-08-29 15:33:56 UTC <ShaunKing> I met William's mother.   She said police came & snatched him out of his bed & took him to the station at least 30 different times.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/902554630638460929
902554630638460929 2017-08-29 15:32:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Meet William Stevens.   A deeply traumatized victim of the NYPD & the Bronx DA's Office.   Forced to falsely testify against 25-30 kids.pic.twitter.com/ofqM9KJech
902553955150045190 2017-08-29 15:30:06 UTC <ShaunKing> On March 1st, 2016 - police arrested Pedro for Attempted Murder.  Except police MADE THE WHOLE CRIME UP. All of it.   Let me explain.
902553521450516481 2017-08-29 15:28:22 UTC <ShaunKing> What I am about to tell you may be the most disturbing thing I've ever seen police & prosecutors collude in. It's deeply criminal.
902553171800838146 2017-08-29 15:26:59 UTC <ShaunKing> With no evidences & no witnesses, police decide to arrest Pedro for this new shooting anyway. Jail him.   8 months later, charges dismissed.pic.twitter.com/i0bleqKnvc
902552841264525317 2017-08-29 15:25:40 UTC <ShaunKing> On 9-12-2015 - someone is shot in the Bronx.   Guns drawn, police seize 15 year old Pedro & show him to 2 adults who say it wasn't him.
902552469598851074 2017-08-29 15:24:12 UTC <ShaunKing> It would be shocking for someone to be falsely arrested & charged, jailed, then have it dismissed ONCE.   For Pedro, IT WAS A WAY OF LIFE.
902551784819970048 2017-08-29 15:21:28 UTC <ShaunKing> On July 14th, 2015 police falsely arrested Pedro for shooting Tyrese Revels.   5 months later they dropped all charges  Here's the dismissalpic.twitter.com/mNu6OhBaqc
902551396167319555 2017-08-29 15:19:56 UTC <ShaunKing> With no witnesses or evidence that Pedro shot this young man, police put Pedro's face on every news station in New York for it anyway.pic.twitter.com/ozHbE0ksbQ

902550229882429440 2017-08-29 15:15:18 UTC <ShaunKing> On July 12th, 2015 a 15 year old boy named Tyrese Revels was shot in the leg. It was not Pedro. They arrest Pedro anyway. Watch this...
902549741212446720 2017-08-29 15:13:21 UTC <ShaunKing> After Pedro was finally released, the NYPD & Bronx DA's Office began two years of cruel, criminal targeting of Pedro. I will break it down.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/902548854377037824
902549494394486785 2017-08-29 15:12:22 UTC <ShaunKing> Late last year, Gregory Hyman was charged with felony assault, cruelty to children, and much more for what he did to Pedro.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/902548854377037824
902549289527861248 2017-08-29 15:11:33 UTC <ShaunKing> After this assault, the NYPD & Bronx DA's Office did nothing for 20 months until media threatened to release the video.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/902548854377037824
902549116705808386 2017-08-29 15:10:52 UTC <ShaunKing> When another child tried to intervene & save Pedro, the other officers stopped him. Pedro was punched, beaten, & choked.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/902548854377037824
902548854377037824 2017-08-29 15:09:50 UTC <ShaunKing> After a false arrest in 2014, Pedro Hernandez was awakened at 1am & brutally beaten by corrections officer Gregory Hyman.pic.twitter.com/qmIxwdwBpj
902548188283973633 2017-08-29 15:07:11 UTC <ShaunKing> I'm going to share Pedro's story with you now, but Pedro is a symbol of hundreds, maybe thousands, of New York kids wronged by the system.
902548010164477953 2017-08-29 15:06:28 UTC <ShaunKing> In The Bronx, I met families with children who've been falsely arrested, charged, jailed, then released, not once, but as many as 15 times.
902547749563977730 2017-08-29 15:05:26 UTC <ShaunKing> The NYPD & the Bronx DA's Office have a clear vendetta against Pedro Hernandez and his entire family. What has happened is despicable.
902547291155841024 2017-08-29 15:03:37 UTC <ShaunKing> Had I not seen & studied & examined what the NYPD & Bronx DA's Office did to Pedro, I don't know that I would've believed it. It's criminal.
902546912875880448 2017-08-29 15:02:07 UTC <ShaunKing> I'm about to break down a criminal conspiracy from the NYPD & Bronx DA's Office against teenager Pedro Hernandez.https://medium.com/@ShaunKing/soul-snatchers-countering-the-state-sponsored-conspiracy-to-destroy-pedro-hernandez-part-3-1b6307828eb6

901802709816414210 2017-08-27 13:44:55 UTC <ShaunKing> This man is an experienced bigot, but also took great care to protect his identity. He first knocked Deandre to the ground.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/901796538359349249
901802427011276800 2017-08-27 13:43:47 UTC <ShaunKing> This man is an actual Nazi. That 88 on his shirt is code for Heil Hitler. The "W" patch means he is a part of Traditionalist Workers Party.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/901796538359349249

901268683103797249 2017-08-25 02:22:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Friends,  One day we will defeat Donald Trump.   He will not remain in power. Until then it will be rough, but we must endure AND organize.
901241381112426496 2017-08-25 00:34:24 UTC <ShaunKing> I am so angry I could cry. The emotions over what Trump is doing to our nation are...heartbreaking and infuriating.
901240965977059329 2017-08-25 00:32:45 UTC <ShaunKing> As our nation prepares for a Category 4 Hurricane, Trump has taken the moment not to calm the nation, but to enflame it with bigotry.
901240137379663872 2017-08-25 00:29:27 UTC <ShaunKing> My God.   Trump pardoned Sheriff Joe.   One of the most problematic bigots in modern American history.
901222484636307456 2017-08-25 23:19:18 UTC <ShaunKing> Thinking of all of my friends in the path of Hurricane Harvey. We will be here to mobilize if you need help.
901222269539758080 2017-08-25 23:18:27 UTC <ShaunKing> @Mr_Henson51 He said a lot more than that.
901221987183460352 2017-08-25 23:17:20 UTC <ShaunKing> I am deeply ashamed of America and the 63 million people who voted for Donald Trump. He is a full fledged bigot. It's just disgusting.
901220618452037632 2017-08-25 23:11:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump just officially signed the order banning transgender folk from the military.   Shame on him and shame on America.
901219627103129600 2017-08-25 23:07:57 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYPDChiefPatrol I don't either. I had hard questions for him on an investigation I am completing. It was a tough conversation but one I had to have
901199018344275972 2017-08-25 21:46:04 UTC <ShaunKing> Listen, the corruption that is about to exposed is criminal and dangerous. I am furious and when you see it you will be too.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/901198417837395968

900825995921457153 2017-08-24 21:03:48 UTC <ShaunKing> This is the hard truth. Rikers itself is a monument to white supremacy.https://twitter.com/glennemartin/status/900825653536317440
900822131839311873 2017-08-24 20:48:27 UTC <ShaunKing> One point I made clear for @NYPDChiefPatrol is that until the department holds its bad apples fully accountable, trust will be hard to build
900821835306160129 2017-08-24 20:47:16 UTC <ShaunKing> Part Three of SOUL SNATCHERS comes out tomorrow and I'll include a point or two from my conversation w/ @NYPDChiefPatrol.
900821511749206016 2017-08-24 20:45:59 UTC <ShaunKing> I found @NYPDChiefPatrol to be sincere. We disagree on New York's history of arrest quotas but agree that many improvements are needed.
900821069304672256 2017-08-24 20:44:14 UTC <ShaunKing> Just had an hour long meeting w/ @NYPDChiefPatrol. He took flack internally for even meeting w/ me. We had a frank, wide ranging discussion.
900772854609969153 2017-08-24 17:32:38 UTC <ShaunKing> Thanks for the love Chris. I apologize in advance for the trolls that will come as a result of this.https://twitter.com/chrispalmernba/status/900751546962526208
900759139088990208 2017-08-24 16:38:08 UTC <ShaunKing> 25. The evidence of quotas is overwhelming. The results are devastating.   It MUST be fix.   READ MORE @:http://ExposeTheQuota.com
900758546748493824 2017-08-24 16:35:47 UTC <ShaunKing> 24. My 3rd question for @NYPDChiefPatrol is:   How can you sincerely, earnestly fix a problem that you will not openly admit even exists?
900758266464088067 2017-08-24 16:34:40 UTC <ShaunKing> 23. My second question for @NYPDChiefPatrol is this:  How do we deny photos, videos, audio recordings of NYPD supervisors demanding quotas?
900757985022156800 2017-08-24 16:33:33 UTC <ShaunKing> 22. I meet w/ @NYPDChiefPatrol today @ 3pm  1st question  Why would your officers risk their lives saying the NYPD has quotas if it doesn't?
900757522184843264 2017-08-24 16:31:43 UTC <ShaunKing> 21. Meet NYPD Sgt. Edwin Raymond.   Here's the current NYPD 12 lawsuit suing the NYPD for illegal arrest quotas.  https://www.scribd.com/document/356822555/Raymond-NYPD-12-v-City-of-New-Yorkpic.twitter.com/oVDtC2mIwP

900755151694290946 2017-08-24 16:22:18 UTC <ShaunKing> 15. For the past 3 years, I have been saying, "I wish police would speak out on police brutality & corruption."  Here's who did in New York.
900754997914292224 2017-08-24 16:21:41 UTC <ShaunKing> 14. When New York settled Stinson v. NYC, and admitted it had nearly 1 million bogus cases, it verified what brave POLICE had said for years
900754697375678464 2017-08-24 16:20:29 UTC <ShaunKing> 13. 900 false charges. That's crazy. 9,000 is WILD. 90,000 blows my mind.   900,000 dismissed cases.  That's a scandal. A conspiracy. POLICY
900754349206503424 2017-08-24 16:19:06 UTC <ShaunKing> 12. Here is where New York & the NYPD agreed to settle their 900,000 bogus cases for $75,000,000.   Settlement:https://www.scribd.com/document/356845911/75-million-settlement-for-Stinson-v-NYC
900754159393267714 2017-08-24 16:18:21 UTC <ShaunKing> 11. When you can, read the class action lawsuit of Stinson v. NYC.  https://www.scribd.com/document/356845874/Stinson-v-NYC-Class-Action-Lawsuit-on-Wrongful-Arrests-Summonses  900,000 false cases.   900,000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
900753883110273024 2017-08-24 16:17:15 UTC <ShaunKing> 10. Just days after Trump was inaugurated, when the news & the nation were focused on Trump, NYC settled it's biggest police scandal ever.
900753638443937796 2017-08-24 16:16:17 UTC <ShaunKing> 9. On this past January 23rd, New York City & the NYPD admitted to 900,000 bogus cases/arrests/summonses. Paid victims $75 million.  900,000
900753192891420675 2017-08-24 16:14:31 UTC <ShaunKing> 8. Three days after Donald Trump was inaugurated, something WILD happened in New York. Hardly anybody knows about it. It's earth shattering.
900752735678730240 2017-08-24 16:12:42 UTC <ShaunKing> 7. Officers who meet or exceed the quotas are promoted and celebrated and those who fail to meet them are demeaned & never through the ranks
900752466450493441 2017-08-24 16:11:37 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. Some officers, in order to meet or exceed their quotas, are willing to arrest people regardless of guilt, innocence, or evidence.
900752352738717697 2017-08-24 16:11:10 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. Officers are being asked, with words other than "quota," to make a certain number of arrests per month. This is illegal.
900752105169932288 2017-08-24 16:10:11 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. The NYPD 12 & hundreds of officers they represent, have accumulated a mountain of evidence proving beyond a doubt that quotas are real.
900751899477069826 2017-08-24 16:09:22 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. Meet the NYPD 12.   Brave, award-winning, veteran Black & Latino NYPD officers who say unequivocally that the force has illegal quotas.pic.twitter.com/3ZGSp4ReWi
900751432340692992 2017-08-24 16:07:31 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. Many issues, including racism, classism, & bigotry, are at the root of New York's false arrest crisis, but brave police have an answer.
900751037417615361 2017-08-24 16:05:57 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. Under our noses, on our watch, New York City has been targeting Black & Latino children & families with a crisis of illegal false arrests
900750503608557570 2017-08-24 16:03:49 UTC <ShaunKing> I welcome @NYPDONeill or @NYPDChiefPatrol or @NYCMayor or @BronxDAClark to join this conversation if they'd like.   Here goes....

900510885554380801 2017-08-23 00:11:40 UTC <ShaunKing> Chief,  I appreciate your reply, but you began with a lie. Award winning officers within your department say quotas have and do exist.https://twitter.com/nypdchiefpatrol/status/900496440367206400

900193347171647493 2017-08-22 03:09:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump is an unashamed, unabashed white supremacist. Saying otherwise is foolish. He embraces & empowers it now more than ever.

899731818475343872 2017-08-21 20:35:56 UTC <ShaunKing> What I've learned about the NYPD's 42nd Precinct, the Bronx DA's Office, & the willingness of city leaders to cover for them is CRIMINAL.
899731320556978178 2017-08-21 20:33:57 UTC <ShaunKing> I have spent the past 4 weeks, including two weeks I took off of my daily work, to take a deep dive into corruption & brutality in the NYPD.

899401165603033093 2017-08-20 22:42:02 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. I have never falsely identified any Nazi's or white supremacists in Charlottesville. We have a 12 layer verification process.
899398475074416641 2017-08-20 22:31:21 UTC <ShaunKing> The search for Dan Borden is tightening.

898989643487510528 2017-08-19 19:26:48 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump is a white supremacist  You could literally cut & paste posts from hate groups to his Twitter account & not know the difference
898989235859881984 2017-08-19 19:25:10 UTC <ShaunKing> Again, this man attacks anti-Nazi protestors. He's determined to create a culture war in America to distract from his unethical failures.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/898988632551370753

898599191705927680 2017-08-18 17:35:17 UTC <ShaunKing> What's wild is that many of us who had been targeted by Bannon saw his attacks slow with him in the White House. No idea what's next.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/898598449637056512
898598449637056512 2017-08-18 17:32:20 UTC <ShaunKing> Before he became White House Chief Strategist, Steve Bannon personally attacked me and my family for months at Breitbart.   A bad person.

898191774325379073 2017-08-17 14:36:21 UTC <ShaunKing> I've been tracking white supremacist conversations on Reddit and 4chan.  They are OVER THE TOP excited about Trump's latest tweets. No joke.
898175395736014851 2017-08-17 13:31:16 UTC <ShaunKing> It's going to get uglier. It's going to get worse before it gets better.   It's happening right now.
898175274738741248 2017-08-17 13:30:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Millions of us said this was going to happen.   You live in such a vacuum, a silo, that you just missed it.https://twitter.com/RedState/status/897822136051666944

898172895016431617 2017-08-17 13:21:20 UTC <ShaunKing> I sincerely feel the rumblings of a new Civil War in America.   It appears Trump wants it. His most faithful followers clearly do.

897959985463689216 2017-08-16 23:15:18 UTC <ShaunKing> To the 4 white men who brutally assaulted Deandre Harris that we have not yet identified:   WE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE FIND YOU.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/897958258555592704
897959396797333504 2017-08-16 23:12:58 UTC <ShaunKing> Right now I want to encourage these 2 men, and the other men who assaulted Deandre Harris, to turn themselves in to authorities.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/897958258555592704
897958837239631877 2017-08-16 23:10:44 UTC <ShaunKing> I am encouraged AND discouraged by this.   A source within the department said they only know the names of the people WE identified. A mess.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/897958258555592704
897958258555592704 2017-08-16 23:08:26 UTC <ShaunKing> BREAKING: I am told that Charlottesville Police will soon issue arrest warrants for the 2 men we've identified:   Dan Borden Michael Ramospic.twitter.com/xKu3QQGyjW

897886828912660482 2017-08-16 18:24:36 UTC <ShaunKing> I support the communists & socialists standing against Trump and against bigotry & white supremacy.   Heather Heyer was one of them.
897886105693016065 2017-08-16 18:21:44 UTC <ShaunKing> I support ANTIFA.   In fact, I'm grateful for them.   Several people told me ANTIFA activists saved their lives in Charlottesville.
897885796467920897 2017-08-16 18:20:30 UTC <ShaunKing> I am not going to move my own life into the "anything goes" way of life, but I will be honest, I'm about to be much more direct.
897885535771013121 2017-08-16 18:19:28 UTC <ShaunKing> When you elect a man as flagrant and offensive and problematic as Trump, and he appoints white supremacists to his cabinet, ANYTHING GOES.
897885360600043523 2017-08-16 18:18:46 UTC <ShaunKing> We have clearly moved into a zone where almost anything goes in America. The election of Trump HAD to mean that. 2017 proves it.

897571789827702789 2017-08-15 21:32:45 UTC <ShaunKing> @lpolgreen It was something else.
897553573202055168 2017-08-15 20:20:22 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump just gave a specific endorsement and approval of the torch carrying white supremacists on Friday. Bragged about their permit.
897553176580153345 2017-08-15 20:18:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Now Trump is defending slave ownership from historic American figures.
897552948863143936 2017-08-15 20:17:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump speaking at great length about the "blame of the Alt-Left" for Charlottesville. It's disgusting.
897552328672366592 2017-08-15 20:15:25 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump is on camera right now defending the white supremacists at Charlottesville. Saying many were good people. No joke.  It's disgusting.

897144899287568385 2017-08-14 17:16:26 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump just hit a new low in the Gallup poll today.   34% approval rating.
897128491833012224 2017-08-14 16:11:14 UTC <ShaunKing> 18. I'll close with this thought. A familiar one from me.   America is FAR more unstable than most of its leaders are truly willing to admit
897127697754849280 2017-08-14 16:08:05 UTC <ShaunKing> 17. Tweets from conservatives denouncing white supremacy are better than nothing, but only slightly so.   How will you DISMANTLE IT???
897127489608220672 2017-08-14 16:07:16 UTC <ShaunKing> 16. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, denouncing white supremacy in a press release is not the same as actually dismantling it.
897127360423710720 2017-08-14 16:06:45 UTC <ShaunKing> 15. If you are denouncing white supremacy now, after a white woman was murdered, you must search out how you've helped build this system.
897127146602287105 2017-08-14 16:05:54 UTC <ShaunKing> 14. If you are denouncing white supremacy but voted for Donald Trump, have regularly defended him, defended Bannon & Miller, you are guilty!
897126959364399104 2017-08-14 16:05:09 UTC <ShaunKing> 13. Secondly, to the Republicans now denouncing white supremacy. You must accept & come to grips with your role in growing & legitimizing it
897126724487589888 2017-08-14 16:04:13 UTC <ShaunKing> 12. When you say America was founded on faith & freedom, that statement inherently dehumanizes 150 million Americans for which that is a LIE
897126439950180352 2017-08-14 16:03:05 UTC <ShaunKing> 11. When you say this nation was founded on faith & freedom, you are denying the depths of systemic bigotry & oppression.
897126302091796480 2017-08-14 16:02:32 UTC <ShaunKing> 10. Millions of LIVING Americans were banned from voting in this nation - including all women.   This nation was NOT FOUNDED ON FREEDOM!!!!!
897125948574846979 2017-08-14 16:01:08 UTC <ShaunKing> 9. LIVING AMERICANS had parents who were enslaved. A woman who voted in this past election - her father was enslaved.
897125747143389184 2017-08-14 16:00:20 UTC <ShaunKing> 8. Not for a few years, or decades, or a few generations, but for nearly 300 years Africans were forced into slavery to build up America.
897125621196873728 2017-08-14 15:59:50 UTC <ShaunKing> 7. Indigenous nations were SLAUGHTERED on these lands. Mauled, murdered, and forced out of their ancestral homes to birth this nation.
897125266333593601 2017-08-14 15:58:25 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. Columbus was son of a bitch. A mean cruel bastard (an understatement). And he never stepped foot in what is now the United States.
897125040814272512 2017-08-14 15:57:32 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. America was not founded on warm fuzzies. This land was taken by brute force and then tilled for 300 years by the enslaved & oppressed.
897124856663244802 2017-08-14 15:56:48 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. If you denounce modern day white supremacy AND believe this nation was founded on faith & freedom, you don't understand white supremacy.
897124676719300608 2017-08-14 15:56:05 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. Republicans, in almost every statement about white supremacy, say that this nation was founded on something like "Faith & Freedom"
897124526093467648 2017-08-14 15:55:29 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. Without fail, though, I see three deeply problematic faults in the otherwise amazing denouncements of white supremacy from Republicans.
897124333780430850 2017-08-14 15:54:43 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. Many Republicans have actually made some very strong statements against white supremacy & racism the past 48 hours (Cruz, Rubio, Hatch)

892762902691762176 2017-08-02 15:03:57 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYDailyNews 11. The Democrats made a huge mistake by not having a true primary this past election. The Clinton coronation hurt state politics.
892762768826408961 2017-08-02 15:03:25 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYDailyNews 10. Democrats should run between 8-10 AMAZING candidates against each other. The best of the best. All-stars. A true primary.
892762447681081345 2017-08-02 15:02:08 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYDailyNews 9. Here's what I think has to happen - to suck the wind out of Trump's candidacy (or Pence if Trump is impeached, arrested, etc.)
892762233498939393 2017-08-02 15:01:17 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYDailyNews 8. With the way the media loves Trump and his social media influence, he will be a very difficult opponent for anyone. I truly believe that.
892762094151626752 2017-08-02 15:00:44 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYDailyNews 7. Donald Trump is a media darling. They LOVE Trump news. AND he has one of the most influential social media footprints in the world
892761924005498881 2017-08-02 15:00:04 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYDailyNews 6. Trump is a nebulous opponent. He lies. He changes positions. He's so unethical that brining it up hardly matters. But here's the big part
892761775048978432 2017-08-02 14:59:28 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYDailyNews 5. Before I press the idea, let me say this. I said last year that Trump would be hard to beat. I think he'll still be hard to beat. Why....
892761602864410627 2017-08-02 14:58:47 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYDailyNews 4. I'd like to put out one big idea. You may love it or hate it, but I think it's necessary to shake up national politics and defeat Trump.
892761241143451649 2017-08-02 14:57:21 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYDailyNews 3. And here is what I know:  a. Trump is already fundraising for his elections. b. Democratic candidates are already maneuvering to run.
892761058972184577 2017-08-02 14:56:37 UTC <ShaunKing> @NYDailyNews 2. The next presidential election in the US will be the longest, most expensive, and most important in modern American history. Period.

892739996775534592 2017-08-02 13:32:56 UTC <ShaunKing> @CBSNews @BaltimorePolice @conbrunstrom Damn right. It's a crime. It needs to have stiff and certain punishment.
892738092481818625 2017-08-02 13:25:22 UTC <ShaunKing> We're seeing the times they planted evidence AND GOT CAUGHT ON CAMERA.   How many thousands of times was the camera not rolling?  Disgustinghttps://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/892737205680066562
892737886759636992 2017-08-02 13:24:33 UTC <ShaunKing> These @BaltimorePolice officers should not only be fired immediately, they should each go to jail. What they did was a serious crime.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/892737205680066562
892737205680066562 2017-08-02 13:21:50 UTC <ShaunKing> For the 2nd time in a month the @BaltimorePolice are caught planting drugs. Every case they have should be dismissed.  Video by @CBSNewspic.twitter.com/3fo5z15l6y

892487985937215488 2017-08-01 20:51:32 UTC <ShaunKing> @_Jahan I've written entire pieces criticizing him. Far from perfect.
892441108130746370 2017-08-01 17:45:15 UTC <ShaunKing> Watch until the very end. Good work from @Trevornoahhttps://twitter.com/thedailyshow/status/892378494541365248

892435393160900610 2017-08-01 17:22:33 UTC <ShaunKing> The militarization of the Federal Government continues. First, a general was installed at the White House. Now one oversees prisons.https://twitter.com/zoetillman/status/892426665233612800

892418311681490948 2017-08-01 16:14:40 UTC <ShaunKing> This is how Seattle Mayoral Candidate @NikkitaOliver spent her morning on Election Day.  pic.twitter.com/9qIp3jPFls
892403504236703745 2017-08-01 15:15:50 UTC <ShaunKing> Gross.   The music to this seems like it was meant for an infomercial exercise DVD set.   Trump and his crew are bigots.https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/892378735512563712

892392178961575937 2017-08-01 14:30:49 UTC <ShaunKing> @DemocracyValues He gave a whole speech explaining this.
892388568253034497 2017-08-01 14:16:29 UTC <ShaunKing> One of the "Alt-Left Activists" Joy dismissed here is the Executive Director of a 200,000 member nurses union.  Just peculiar. And sad.https://twitter.com/joyannreid/status/892213755328811010
892388076349263873 2017-08-01 14:14:31 UTC <ShaunKing> Before Joy hated Bernie she loved him.   Before she said he's not a Democrat she said he was the "clarion voice" of the Party.pic.twitter.com/Sqz3knT0n6
892387693572890624 2017-08-01 14:13:00 UTC <ShaunKing> Gross erasure and oversimplification of 3 amazing women from @JoyAnnReid here. Also, the term Alt-Left is ridiculous.https://twitter.com/joyannreid/status/892213755328811010
892383746426626053 2017-08-01 13:57:19 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. Tomorrow I will write in the @NYDailyNews about a big idea I have for the Democratic Party.
892383003405635585 2017-08-01 13:54:22 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. I do think many Democrats just don't understand how much some people deeply believe in certain policy ideas like Medicare for All.
892382531110260738 2017-08-01 13:52:29 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. For instance, I agree publicly that Bernie must do more to connect deeply with Black voters. That's not divisive. It's called growth.
892382220085866496 2017-08-01 13:51:15 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. Medicare For All matters. $15 minimum wage matters. Big money out of politics matters. And we are allowed to critique people on those.
892381815532642308 2017-08-01 13:49:39 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. I really respect @KamalaHarris but have policy concerns on her time as Attorney General of California. That's not an attack/racist/sexist
892381497998663680 2017-08-01 13:48:23 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. Democrats need to understand that disagreeing with a policy position someone has, even strongly disagreeing, is not an attack.
892381116493123584 2017-08-01 13:46:52 UTC <ShaunKing> If you are actually attacking her, then I agree with Brian.   If you are thoughtfully critiquing her policy positions, then I disagree.https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/892154882622468096

892131861023121409 2017-07-31 21:16:25 UTC <ShaunKing> @samswey I am in the Bernie camp. I respect her a great deal, but have the same reservations about her criminal justice record as you.
892130391578030080 2017-07-31 21:10:34 UTC <ShaunKing> Oh.https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/888472045415264257

892129490935185409 2017-07-31 21:07:00 UTC <ShaunKing> Wow.https://twitter.com/BillPlaschke/status/892117829872345088

891684812184068098 2017-07-30 15:40:00 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. What's absolutely wild is seeing Republicans now argue that how a man treats his family & children means absolutely nothing. Just wild.
891684196133081088 2017-07-30 15:37:33 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. When a woman who is 9 months pregnant files for divorce, and her husband chooses a political event over the child birth, it matters.
891683969313492996 2017-07-30 15:36:39 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. How @Scaramucci has mistreated his family, matters.   How Trump has mistreated his family for decades matters.   It reveals character.
891683444647919616 2017-07-30 15:34:34 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. It's utterly amazing to see conservatives now argue that how a man treats (or mistreats) his family has no bearing on his politics.
891673905806667776 2017-07-30 14:56:40 UTC <ShaunKing> I've got mad love for this man. What he did was simple, but brave. We very much need more cops to follow his lead.https://twitter.com/gpdbentobias/status/891032023086895105

891114929545261056 2017-07-28 01:55:29 UTC <ShaunKing> Literally, if I had to concoct a candidate to defeat Donald Trump, or pick any politician in all of history to do so, it would be Obama.
891114531300274177 2017-07-28 01:53:55 UTC <ShaunKing> If Obama could run for office today, I sincerely think he could beat Trump by 20 points.   Obama is the anti-Trump.

891068457533534208 2017-07-28 22:50:50 UTC <ShaunKing> The 700th person was just killed by American police in 2017. This year is on pace to be the deadliest year ever measured for police violence
891053246080569345 2017-07-28 21:50:23 UTC <ShaunKing> I can't quite explain it, but I just feel like we are not doing enough about where Trump is taking our country. It's just not enough.
891050197802942465 2017-07-28 21:38:16 UTC <ShaunKing> I actually agree with this.https://twitter.com/NancyMcquaide/status/891043721244028928
891049712484311040 2017-07-28 21:36:21 UTC <ShaunKing> Trump is about to throw everything he has into building the border wall immigration raids. He & Kelly will double down on these things.
891047101806915585 2017-07-28 21:25:58 UTC <ShaunKing> I don't have answers, but I know that I am deeply uncomfortable with where our nation is and where Trump is taking it.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/891043485960343553
891043485960343553 2017-07-28 21:11:36 UTC <ShaunKing> I continue to say that the United States of America is far more unstable than any of us are willing to admit.
891042375228956674 2017-07-28 21:07:11 UTC <ShaunKing> I agree.https://twitter.com/rezaaslan/status/891039186500935682

891039440889679874 2017-07-28 20:55:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Donald Trump is desperate to find people who will simply do as he says and not ask questions.

891020515980267522 2017-07-28 19:40:20 UTC <ShaunKing> The gross moment where Trump encourages police to be brutal for no reason whatsoever.   The officers, of course, roared with approval.pic.twitter.com/XuzhWsrTkK
891019212390641664 2017-07-28 19:35:09 UTC <ShaunKing> Indeed. You should read this book from Chris.https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/891010704148492289
891009578883837954 2017-07-28 18:56:52 UTC <ShaunKing> To understand Trump's current speech to police, read my piece on Trump's ugly new push to ignite his hateful base.http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-trump-reactivates-hate-excite-bigoted-base-article-1.3358455
891007542851248130 2017-07-28 18:48:46 UTC <ShaunKing> The President of the United States just openly, blatantly endorsed police brutality and encouraged police officers to be "rough" w/ suspects
891005509960175618 2017-07-28 18:40:42 UTC <ShaunKing> As I've reported for three straight years, the greatest threat to the safety & security of American police officers =   WHITE MEN.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/891005246738239489
891005246738239489 2017-07-28 18:39:39 UTC <ShaunKing> This is Jason Brown.  He just killed a great officer in Indiana.  Conservatives were PISSED.  Until they saw that Jason Brown is white.pic.twitter.com/G6qHbVwrFh

890970805575856129 2017-07-28 16:22:48 UTC <ShaunKing> 15. What we're experiencing is the normalization of toxic white masculinity. What was once at least politically incorrect is now permissible
890970543284944897 2017-07-28 16:21:45 UTC <ShaunKing> 14. Multiple Congressmen & government employees threatened physical violence against the women of their own party this week. A new low.
890970300082511873 2017-07-28 16:20:47 UTC <ShaunKing> 13. How can ANYBODY be held accountable for threatening a woman, assaulting a reporter, or sexually harassing them w/ Trump as President?
890970090153414656 2017-07-28 16:19:57 UTC <ShaunKing> 12. What we are experiencing right now is what happens when you elect Donald Trump as President.   Common decency disappears as a standard.
890969934385360898 2017-07-28 16:19:20 UTC <ShaunKing> 11. What we are experiencing, with MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT assaulting, harassing, and threatening people, is dangerous new American low.

890968863902494720 2017-07-28 16:15:05 UTC <ShaunKing> 7. Trump stopped his call with the Prime Minister of Ireland to harass an Irish reporter on how she lookedhttps://theintercept.com/2017/06/28/trump-interrupts-call-irish-leader-harass-irish-reporter/
890968620985180161 2017-07-28 16:14:07 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. Trump looked the First Lady of France up and down and commented on her looks.http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/13/politics/trump-brigitte-macron-handshake/index.html

890292057444667392 2017-07-26 19:25:41 UTC <ShaunKing> I continue to believe that the United States is far more unstable than most of us are comfortable admitting.
890270993385652228 2017-07-26 18:01:59 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. Having studied Trump for 2 years and written 100+ articles on him, my best guess is that right now Trump is LOVING LIFE and is very happy
890270697699848192 2017-07-26 18:00:49 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. Between the Boy Scouts speech and his tweets this morning, his speech last night has been lost.   His most anti-immigrant speech ever.
890270499472846848 2017-07-26 18:00:02 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. He will throw any of his peers under the bus. He will offend anyone if it gets him chants & applause. He will speak & act rashly.
890270095678877696 2017-07-26 17:58:25 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. We have entered, it appears, a new phase of the Trump presidency that most closely resembles the lowest points of his campaign.
890269875087781889 2017-07-26 17:57:33 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. Secondarily, the past 72 hours from Trump are about his dangerous &  desperate need for applause, chants, & affirmation. He lives for it.
890269621609259009 2017-07-26 17:56:32 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. The past 72 hours are primarily about Trump wanting to rally his bigoted base at all costs. He wants them excited and ready to fight.
890269382819164160 2017-07-26 17:55:35 UTC <ShaunKing> The past 72 hours from the Boy Scouts fiasco, to his rally attacking immigrants last night, to his anti-Trans tweets, are all about 2 things
890268876075827204 2017-07-26 17:53:35 UTC <ShaunKing> @MattBors That's depressing.
890267636646412290 2017-07-26 17:48:39 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.  With his presidency in tatters, Donald Trump reactivates hate to fire up his bigoted base. THEY LOVE IThttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-president-trump-reactivates-hate-excite-bigoted-base-article-1.3358455

887853638034440192 2017-07-19 01:56:17 UTC <ShaunKing> Amazing. All my life I hear conservatives scream "States Rights."  Now that they have federal powers, they show local control means nothing.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/886615170063241216

887831294800928768 2017-07-19 00:27:30 UTC <ShaunKing> Toronto. What's up!pic.twitter.com/Kdq0CZ1bqK
887816264139259905 2017-07-19 23:27:46 UTC <ShaunKing> 11. I think the NFL's treatment of Colin Kaepernick is one of the most disgusting moments in American sports history.
887816074686717952 2017-07-19 23:27:01 UTC <ShaunKing> 10. So yeah, Vick was right, if Colin cut his hair & went out of his way to shun all outward signs of Blackness/consciousness, it might help
887815323340029952 2017-07-19 23:24:02 UTC <ShaunKing> 9. The NFL clearly preferred Colin when he was single, with a tight fade, posing with his shirt off, saying very little about injustice.
887815098475061248 2017-07-19 23:23:08 UTC <ShaunKing> 8. The NFL wants to know that they have broken Colin's spirit. White men have forced haircuts as a sign of such a thing for centuries.
887814338970492928 2017-07-19 23:20:07 UTC <ShaunKing> 7. Colin's hair is a problem for fragile white fans & team owners because it's a symbol of his love for Black revolutionaries. They hate it.
887813837117767680 2017-07-19 23:18:08 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. I actually think if Colin cut his hair, married a white woman, and got in trouble with the law, blamed stress, he might get an NFL job
887813364142886913 2017-07-19 23:16:15 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. I actually think if Colin cut his hair, apologized for ever taking a knee, shunned all activists publicly he "might" get an NFL job
887812827724914688 2017-07-19 23:14:07 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. In fact Kaepernick had an afro BEFORE he spoke out on police brutality and it was NEVER a problem until the world understood his thinking
887812473981517824 2017-07-19 23:12:43 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. The NFL does not have problems with long hair. Or even big hair from men of color as long as it isn't a clear symbol of Black Power.pic.twitter.com/PG2UpaoE4h
887812135237042176 2017-07-19 23:11:22 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. A deep truth was revealed in Mike Vick's comments from the sunken place on Colin Kaepernick cutting his hair to get back into the NFL...
887811409538539521 2017-07-19 23:08:29 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. THREAD.  I'd like to take a moment to break down Mike Vick's painful audition for Get Out 2.

887684536124964864 2017-07-19 14:44:20 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.  Mike Vick was actually right about Colin Kaepernick.   (You should read before commenting.)http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/king-mike-vick-colin-kaepernick-article-1.3338197
887677121023311874 2017-07-19 14:14:52 UTC <ShaunKing> 9. Do you know how outrageously false the charges had to be for a Black revolutionary in the 1970s to beat six different cases?
887676223186501632 2017-07-19 14:11:18 UTC <ShaunKing> 8. Before Assata was ever charged with killing a police officer, who SHE DID NOT KILL, she had been falsely charged & acquitted SIX TIMES.
887675856600084480 2017-07-19 14:09:51 UTC <ShaunKing> 7. On January 23rd, 1973, Assata Shakur was charged with attempted murder. AGAIN, the charges were dismissed.
887675243111882756 2017-07-19 14:07:24 UTC <ShaunKing> 6. On January 2nd, 1973 Assata Shakur was charged with murder. The case against her was later dismissed.
887674965453090816 2017-07-19 14:06:18 UTC <ShaunKing> 5. On December 28th, 1972 Assata Shakur was arrested and charged with kidnapping a grown man. She was tried and acquitted on all charges.
887674746355273729 2017-07-19 14:05:26 UTC <ShaunKing> 4. On September 1st, 1972, Assata Shakur was charged with yet another bank robbery and was later acquitted on all charges.
887674473125748736 2017-07-19 14:04:21 UTC <ShaunKing> 3. On August 23rd, 1971, Assata Shakur was arrested for an armed bank robbery in New York, but was acquitted on all charges.
887674256871624704 2017-07-19 14:03:29 UTC <ShaunKing> 2. On April 5th, 1971 Assata Shakur was arrested and charged with armed robbery.   They later dismissed all charges.
887674029590687744 2017-07-19 14:02:35 UTC <ShaunKing> 1. In the 1970s, both the FBI & police departments across the country, regularly targeted Assata Shakur with endless arrests & fake charges.

887642369247649792 2017-07-19 11:56:47 UTC <ShaunKing> Assata Shakur did not kill a cop. Calling her a cop-killer is a lie.  Under cross examination, the witness admitted he lied about it all.pic.twitter.com/bXQFY6K3eb
887494712197885952 2017-07-18 02:10:02 UTC <ShaunKing> The officer who murdered Justine is literally saying it's because they heard fireworks somewhere outside and assumed she had a gun. BS.https://twitter.com/couriermail/status/887429333039632384

887459995461312513 2017-07-18 23:52:05 UTC <ShaunKing> @jaketapper Actually @JakeTapper, this is fundamentally untrue. Assata Shakur is not a cop killer. She never shot a cop. You need to brush up on this.https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/887404064811757568

887308149396471808 2017-07-18 13:48:42 UTC <ShaunKing> MEDICARE FOR ALL.
887306120393523203 2017-07-18 13:40:39 UTC <ShaunKing> The ruling party in America is now openly bragging that they will knock 32 million people off of their health insurance. It's disgusting.
887305831431229441 2017-07-18 13:39:30 UTC <ShaunKing> If anything has proven that Republicans don't stand for anything of substance, it's 2017. They hated Obama for 8 years, but that's it.
887305590778810368 2017-07-18 13:38:32 UTC <ShaunKing> Republicans have had 9 years to craft healthcare legislation. They run the House, Senate, and Presidency and have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

885499566975582208 2017-07-13 14:02:03 UTC <ShaunKing> @ReggieWatkinsJr Man. It is so possible
885498970470055937 2017-07-13 13:59:40 UTC <ShaunKing> @WillAtkins4FL I address that in my piece.
885498899896696832 2017-07-13 13:59:24 UTC <ShaunKing> If California & New York turnout HUGE #'s for Dems in 2020 a Republican could win the election but lose by somewhere near 10 million votes.
885498112843952133 2017-07-13 13:56:16 UTC <ShaunKing> A very real scenario exists in which Trump loses by 5-10 million votes, loses a few states he won last time, and STILL wins the election.
885497930421030912 2017-07-13 13:55:33 UTC <ShaunKing> It is my belief that the problems of the Electoral College will worsen and that candidates could lose by even more votes & win the election
885496549157068800 2017-07-13 13:50:03 UTC <ShaunKing> If California became 9 states, those 9 states would have 18 Senators instead of 2. They'd have proper representation in the Senate.
885496195489071111 2017-07-13 13:48:39 UTC <ShaunKing> A few years ago I thought the idea of breaking California up into 7-10 states was foolhardy, now I understand some ways that would help.
885496057492369409 2017-07-13 13:48:06 UTC <ShaunKing> Also, it is ridiculous that California has 40 million people and has 2 Senators & Wyoming has 600,000 people with the same number.
885493686796251136 2017-07-13 13:38:41 UTC <ShaunKing> Reform #5: Abolish the Electoral College. Nobody should be elected President of the United States if they lost by 3 million votes - period.
885493485213802496 2017-07-13 13:37:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Reform #4: Restore the voting rights of all former prisoners. They've served their time. Removing their voting rights is preposterous.
885493158175440896 2017-07-13 13:36:35 UTC <ShaunKing> Reform #3: Either make election days national holidays or put them on the weekend. This is the standard around the world.
885492926817730561 2017-07-13 13:35:40 UTC <ShaunKing> Reform #2: Vote By Mail. It's the law now in 3 states. In Oregon it has helped created 70.4% voter turnout - far above the national average
885492617206693888 2017-07-13 13:34:26 UTC <ShaunKing> Reform #1: Automatic voter registration. When you turn 18, you should be automatically registered to vote. That's the law in 8 states.
885492402450026496 2017-07-13 13:33:35 UTC <ShaunKing> My Latest.  Hardcore reforms - some achievable, some experimental, we should be fighting for if we are a democracy.http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/king-ways-create-representative-u-s-democracy-article-1.3320845

884825542444429312 2017-07-11 17:23:43 UTC <ShaunKing> @ggreenwald Legally - is that a good strategy? As damning as those emails are?
884825227481501697 2017-07-11 17:22:28 UTC <ShaunKing> Republicans are now at the critical point where they have, perhaps, one last chance to jump off the Trump train, or be hitched on for good.
884824989131845633 2017-07-11 17:21:31 UTC <ShaunKing> I don't think a single member of the Trump administration is clean on this current scandal. It is overtaking his entire Presidency.
884824452915236865 2017-07-11 17:19:23 UTC <ShaunKing> I want to double down on this tweet.   What we are experiencing right now, at this very moment, is a crisis for our democracy.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/884168911905861633
884822692616122369 2017-07-11 17:12:23 UTC <ShaunKing> Something's very strange about Trump, Jr. releasing those emails. It just doesn't make sense. They are so outrageously damning.
884818516196691968 2017-07-11 16:55:48 UTC <ShaunKing> This email is incriminating. It openly tells Trump, Jr that he is colluding with the Russian Government and he encourages the meetingshttps://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/884789839522140166
884817546280673280 2017-07-11 16:51:56 UTC <ShaunKing> Wow.   The email openly told Trump, Jr the meetings he scheduled were a "part of Russia and it's government support for Mr. Trump."pic.twitter.com/bn7IrqWwjP

882586078565330944 2017-07-05 13:04:53 UTC <ShaunKing> Today, for the @NYDailyNews, I will be pressing my case on this very thing. Sadly, it's a simple, easy case to make - based on the facts.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/882459836423827456
882557613178855425 2017-07-05 11:11:46 UTC <ShaunKing> A despicable and cowardly attack on an officer here in New York. The fool who killed her was shot & killed right after. What a waste.https://twitter.com/nydailynews/status/882531621647388673
882462474552971264 2017-07-04 04:53:43 UTC <ShaunKing> I don't feel this way because of Donald Trump. No, he is but one piece of evidence in this very factual argument.https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/882459836423827456

882459836423827456 2017-07-04 04:43:14 UTC <ShaunKing> The United States is not the best country in the world. Anyone who says this has a definition of greatness rooted in greed & white supremacy

881977777632792576 2017-07-03 20:47:43 UTC <ShaunKing> I won't criticize people who are obsessed with Trump's tweets, but I won't respond to them ever again. We have SO MUCH more to do.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/881975606841405440
