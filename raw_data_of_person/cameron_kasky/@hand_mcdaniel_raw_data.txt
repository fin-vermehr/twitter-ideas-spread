971756472022388741 2018-03-08 14:36:11 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @weeklystandard @DonaldJTrumpJr Got it. Farrakhan is the word of distraction today. Best not to talk about daddy's porn star payoff, BIL Jared's back channel problems, Trump people doing self-deportation from WH and, thinking, thinking what else. Oh, that "Russia" thing. Have a great day!!
971744370675167232 2018-03-08 13:48:06 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr No, what is sick, Junior, is a man who pays off porn stars to hide an affair from your stepmom. Evangelicals have now added two new acceptable behaviors to their tenets. Sex with porn stars while married AND pedophilia. What is truly sick? Sarah spilled the beans!!
971740619046404101 2018-03-08 13:33:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CillizzaCNN When we hear the term "arbitration" out of @PressSec mouth and immediately hear gasps from reporters in the room, it is must see TV. Did she just confirm the whole affair? Evangelicals are cutting new TV ad to make sleeping with porn stars acceptable, new rule after pedophiles.
971728518609485831 2018-03-08 12:45:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Is this the Tuesday Trump or the Thursday Trump? Asking for a concerned country who sees their POTUS unraveling. Oh, and about that arbitration with the porn star? Sarah spilled the beans!! Hurry up Mueller!!
971723370189369344 2018-03-08 12:24:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Oh, Rafael, just how much do you hate your real name @tedcruz? Rafael is a fine name, Ted. Why do you hide from it, Rafael? I "beto" you can't give us a good answer.
971532279494230016 2018-03-07 23:45:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @Seahawks @TMBFoundation @mosesbread72 I am so sad to see you go, Michael!! We will miss you!!
971379168482009088 2018-03-07 13:36:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @cnni How cute, @realDonaldTrump, they went to Jared! How proud you must be of that son-in-law! He must go!! Oh, and another cooperating witness for Mueller!
971356235256614913 2018-03-07 12:05:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How about your daughter's MADE IN CHINA shoes & purses made at a sweatshop? What about all of the products you use in Trump properties made everywhere BUT the USA. Do as I say, not as I do? Trumps want everyone else to manufacture in USA, but THEM! Zero economic patriotism.
971025088094003206 2018-03-06 14:09:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Who has the majority in the House? In the Senate? What POTUS ended DACA? That would be you, the racist embarrassment currently fouling the air of our WH. Hurry the hell up, Mueller! This bought man won't punish Putin by imposing the Russian sanctions. There's a word for that.
971022929331814401 2018-03-06 14:01:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Raise your hand if you think the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. So, today's distraction is the Oscars? You can try to distract your sheep, but Mueller became a laser-focused bird dog once he picked up the scent of Russia lovers and dirty money. Nyet?
971016766997450752 2018-03-06 13:36:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump LOL at your joke! Lowest rated POTUS thinks he's a "Star". Putin's Puppet wants to dance on stage so the whole world pays attention to HIM, not the country. Impose the Russian sanctions to prove you aren't in Putin's pocket. You can't, can you? What are you hiding?
971009829232783360 2018-03-06 13:09:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, USA will now be known as the world's gas tank and the only country who hasn't signed on to Paris climate agreement. You embarrass my country with every action. Nyet, comrade?
971009200603021314 2018-03-06 13:06:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Is this the Tuesday Trump or the Thursday Trump? People don't trust a word you say because it becomes moot the next day when something else pops out of your mouth. Who can negotiate with a liar and a con man? Not even your own party!!!
971008072083623937 2018-03-06 13:02:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Hahahahaha!! No one has had the staff turnover like you. Who would want to babysit an unhinged POTUS all day? Who would want to be forced to tell "little lies" for you? Who wants to be charged with Obstruction of Justice along with you? #PutinsPuppet
970993942794723330 2018-03-06 12:06:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec Great? US becomes world's gas tank, the POTUS loves to gaslight and Putin loves to pull his puppet master strings and make Donnie dance. Impose the Russian sanctions and prepare us for 2018 elections. To do neither of those proves that @realDonaldTrump is #PutinsPuppet.
970854274363146240 2018-03-05 02:51:11 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump It's March 5th and another former Trump campaign adviser makes headlines - this time for refusing Mueller's subpoena. He said some interesting things today. Oh, Sam, those of us who are wide awake know just why Trump fired Comey & that Carter Page colluded. #PutinsPuppet
970647377940955136 2018-03-05 13:09:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump To protect America, we should not and cannot be at war with our allies. Your unhinged trade meltdown shows a man desperate to change the subject from Russia and away from his own crimes. If you wanted to protect America, you would impose the Russian sanctions! #PutinsPuppet
970324013330264064 2018-03-04 15:44:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill That's a tough call. I'd like her to leave his cheating butt; but I don't know the terms of her prenup. Stephen Miller, on the other hand, has no prenup and is pure evil.
969968817332891648 2018-03-03 16:12:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I don't even know where to start with you. It's overwhelming trying to keep track of the scandals in your administration. Your recent meltdown & Twitter words to start a trade war continue to show just how unfit you are in every respect & how bad you are at this job! Nyet?
969532092181749760 2018-03-02 11:17:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Guess who pays for your trade temper tantrum @realDonaldTrump? American consumers. That $1.50 a week in tax breaks won't even begin to pay for the increases in products we buy. You are really bad at this job!!
969531270601457665 2018-03-02 11:14:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You are clueless. Your solar tariff alone will cost 23,000 U.S. jobs. The Dow dumped another 420 points yesterday in response to your new tariffs for steel and aluminum. You are really bad at this job. Hurry the hell up, Mueller. Putin's Puppet is out-of-control!!
969526506169839618 2018-03-02 10:55:06 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @RuthMarcus Thanks, Ruth! I couldn't decide whether to point out his spelling or post a clip of Kate McKinnon's "Robert Mueller". Bobby won.
969524795296514048 2018-03-02 10:48:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Of course you would bully the guy who does a spot on impersonation of you. I like Baldwin for sure; but it's Kate McKinnon's "Robert Mueller" who rules the school. ICYMI:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU1aQmjFikM
969523586758098955 2018-03-02 10:43:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @chrislhayes FYI - Governor Inslee has vetoed the bill.
969378065263378432 2018-03-01 01:05:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How about those MADE IN CHINA shoes & handbags that your daughter makes in foreign sweatshops? Perhaps you should put a tariff on importing those!!! Or, the products that you feature in Trump hotels with their foreign made labels? Zero economic patriotism...or any other kind.
969313364605194240 2018-03-01 20:48:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Are you watching the Dow plunge because of your wanting to go to war with other countries - a trade war? Did you see that 10% of workers in solar got laid off because of your other idiotic trade policy? You are really, really bad at this job!!!
969312885208838144 2018-03-01 20:46:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MeetThePress What a dumb, dumb man you are @realDonaldTrump. How much is Dow plunging TODAY in response to something DUMB you propose. -470 by my eyes. And 10% of workers in the solar industry get pink slips because of your terrible stewardship of our country!!
969187785797091329 2018-03-01 12:29:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN @TomRooney The only thing that needs to end is House Republicans trying to stop an investigation into the most corrupt administration ever in the WH. Little Lies/Big Lies...they are all lies trying to hide illegal acts by Trump and his gang. Do YOUR job, Rooney!!
969018027386707968 2018-02-28 01:14:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec I am so disgusted by the whole lot of you who feel you must tell lies for the man you work for. Not to worry...she'll be free to talk to Mueller all about that Trump Tower memo and her role in it. She got spooked during House? Wait til Mueller gets her in the interview room.
969016420745977857 2018-02-28 01:08:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Of course he does. @realDonaldTrump is a small, petty, vindictive man unable to lead the once greatest country in the world.
968872178576863238 2018-02-28 15:35:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @jlallennh Yet, yet...your POTUS took to Twitter this morning to do just that with Attorney General Sessions. You people want to have it both ways. I dare @realDonaldTrump to tweet 1) his priority to stop Russian meddling and 2) he will impose the sanctions. He can't/won't.
968868152363790338 2018-02-28 15:19:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TheRickWilson I love your comebacks!!! I hope you don't mind that I've shared your words on Facebook. I'm a liberal feminist who is enjoying the heck out of sharing Republican's words & having my moral GOP friends like it!!
968864609875591168 2018-02-28 15:04:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @thehill @jlallennh Illinois, a state where voter registration databases were breached in 2016, requested an assessment in January and is still waiting. Primary voters go to the polls Mar 20; state officials can't say whether the assessment will happen beforehand. DHS says by mid-April. Moron?
968859697804599296 2018-02-28 14:45:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @thehill @jlallennh Congress ordered State to pursue the initiative last year, but it is unclear when the program, in full, will actually kick in.  LAST YEAR!! But our NSA Director said yesterday that he had been given no authority. WTF!! So, about those Russian sanctions? Another Trump cluster.
968855398848512006 2018-02-28 14:28:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @jlallennh Bullshit. Why has Trump done nothing to prepare us for 2018? He's Putin's Puppet who will do nothing to protect my country. I challenge @realDonaldTrump to speak to this and prove he's not a puppet. Also, if he imposed the Russian sanctions, it might help. He can't!
968851513190711298 2018-02-28 14:12:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I'd rather talk about why you haven't given the NSA the direction to go after Russian election interference. Admiral Rogers testimony to the Senate yesterday couldn't be more clear. You are Putin's Puppet and will do nothing. Dereliction of duty, you Russian tool. Nyet?
968850938449444864 2018-02-28 14:10:38 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Admiral Mike Rogers nailed it yesterday by saying @realDonaldTrump hasn't given him the authority to go after Russian interference. The whole rotten family is chin-deep in rubles. Javanka shouldn't go anywhere near our top secret intel! They need to go back to 666!!
968849020008333313 2018-02-28 14:03:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @repdonyoung @thehill Isn't he the same guy who said of one of my congressional delegation "a young lady" who "doesnt know a damn thing what shes talking about." @RepDonYoung you are a joke! Alaska should be ashamed of your ignorance!!!
968831401947578368 2018-02-28 12:53:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PeteWilliamsNBC @MeetThePress My proper attire to vote my mail ballot is whatever I feel like wearing at my kitchen table when I fill it out. It's a paper ballot that can't be hacked and altered by Russia. Since @realDonaldTrump won't protect us, we need to do it state-by-state. Paper Ballots!!
968827606698045441 2018-02-28 12:37:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Just curious how you plan to protect us from RUSSIA interference in 2018. You haven't done shit, nor given the order to your team to do it. Your sheep might get distracted cheering for your dumb wall, but the rest of us know where the real danger lies. #PutinsPuppet
968826553449590784 2018-02-28 12:33:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump LOL...LOL Does anyone in the White House have a proper security clearance? Does Jared get to continue trying to promote (his) business? Wasn't it his family who got caught trying to sell visas for cash? The WH is full of con men & women who soil it and our country!! Nyet?
968680323046293504 2018-02-27 02:52:40 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill New Hampshire. Check. Connecticut. Check. Two special elections tonight in districts @realDonaldTrump and @VP won in 2016. Flipped...just like Gates, Papa, Flynn... Hey, Mike, your Evangelical agenda ain't going anywhere. Flip, flip, flip is the word of 2018.
968678623740772352 2018-02-27 02:45:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill More extreme vetting by @realDonaldTrump of his staff. He hires all the "best people"...who can't pass a background check. And WTF is Jared doing setting up back channel meetings with foreign entities & keeping them secret for National Intelligence? WTF!!
968475345484619776 2018-02-27 13:18:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @JRubinBlogger Did you see him cross his arms, stick his hands into his armpits to comfort himself yesterday when my Governor schooled him? He's so used to YES MEN that when he's confronted by a REAL MAN, he runs. He's a coward and a Russian tool!
968469705588596736 2018-02-27 12:55:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You are losing it, Trump!!! How many of your people have been indicted? How many of your people have already pleaded guilty? The only hunt Mueller is on is to track down people who commit illegal acts and play footsie with the Russians. Nyet?
968467220694155268 2018-02-27 12:45:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Curious minds want to know why a political consultant, well known in D.C. circles as a hack for Russia and Ukraine, would offer to manage your campaign for FREE? And, why would you accept such a man on your team? And, not impose the Russian sanctions? #PutinsPuppet
968465471249956864 2018-02-27 12:38:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump How about money laundering? How about your foreign bank loans? How about obstruction of justice? What does Gates have on you? Will Manafort spill the beans on the Trump Tower meeting with those Russians to save his skin? Or, do you plan to pardon the whole stinking lot?
968464501505847296 2018-02-27 12:35:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN @IvankaTrump and her hubby need to exit the White House. Neither one can pass a security clearance background check and they have ZERO credentials to do anything in this government. You are diplomatic arm candy with no substance, Barbie.
968457379200159744 2018-02-27 12:06:46 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @marthamaccallum @judgenapolitano @realDonaldTrump LOL...How fun was watching my Governor school you on your arm the teachers bonehead idea. Why do you cross your arms and stick your hands into your armpits whenever you are being challenged? It's quite the tell!!!
968260840024518657 2018-02-26 23:05:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MeetThePress What a joke! Thinking of @realDonaldTrump "running" anywhere is something I would pay to see. Oh, and my WA St Governor still plays basketball and in addition to schooling you today re: arming teachers, he can outrun you by a WA vs WA mile! Trump running...LOL!
968237002654081024 2018-02-26 21:31:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TheLastWord Gotta love Trump's body language when MY governor schools him. It's like he's not used to people pushing back at him with articulate, intelligent debate. Jay Inslee ain't one of your "Yes Men" @realDonaldTrump! He represents the "other" Washington where sanity prevails.
968217574168084480 2018-02-26 20:13:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @washingtonpost Of course he did!! This is what Mona Charen was talking about at CPAC. Will the GOP rally around this guy too? Will GOP women endorse & embrace him? Will the last woman in the Trump GOP turn the lights out? Or, do you need a man to tell you to do that too?
968211913162149890 2018-02-26 19:51:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @joshtpm He wraps his arms around himself for protection from my Governor. He's pissed and not used to people speaking truth to him. Go, Jay, Go!!!
968211167360401413 2018-02-26 19:48:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TIME @FedEx Not one penny more!!! UPS and USPS get it done better...without the blood of our children on their hands!! Not one penny!!
968205763276451840 2018-02-26 19:26:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN Watch his body language as my Governor takes him to task! He's pissed. Loved it. Go, Jay, Go!!!
968204887430483968 2018-02-26 19:23:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics That's MY governor!! Tell him, Jay...even if he's wrapped his arms so tightly around himself to control his anger and disbelief that someone is talking to him this way. News Flash @realDonaldTrump you should listen to people instead of making it about you.
968202095303172096 2018-02-26 19:12:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NBCPolitics Go, Jay, Go!!!
968200884399235074 2018-02-26 19:07:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JRubinBlogger He's my Governor and would make a great challenger to DJT!!
968199623117488128 2018-02-26 19:02:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill That's my Gov!! Tell him, Jay!! "So I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here, a little more listening, said Inslee, who has been rumored as a possible Democratic challenger to Trump in 2020. Lets just take that off the table and move forward.
968121455891238913 2018-02-26 13:51:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @AP_Politics @IvankaTrump You are a special advisor to the President. When you put on that hat, you take the other one off. You can't have it both ways, Barbie. So, while I've got your attention...about those security clearances for you & Jared? Got mine in 3 mos. Didn't have Russian bankers!
968109469501595650 2018-02-26 13:04:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN Thank You @monacharenEPPC!! It truly must be said over and over again to get through to some conservatives. As a woman and a mother, it sickens me to see women embrace a sexual predator and endorse a pedophile. Keep speaking out/challenging them!
967905160474185728 2018-02-25 23:32:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @chucktodd @MeetThePress @RepThomasMassie The only pigs are those who have gotten fat eating at the NRA $$$$ trough. My niece's ex is 100% PTSD disabled vet, armed to the teeth, crazy as s**t, stoned on pills and pot and he still has his arsenal - with a restraining order on him. Explain please.
967751702160990208 2018-02-25 13:22:40 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @guskenworthy You nailed it, Gus!! She's probably wearing her MADE IN CHINA Ivanka sweat shop shoes. Congratulations to all of our USA Olympians. You made us proud!
967750337133084672 2018-02-25 13:17:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @playbookplus How come @SpeakerRyan takes to Twitter to brag about an American getting an additional $1.50 a week, but stays silent on the $29 billion this one corporation got? Because he's counting on the GOP sheep to keep saying that they like their penny tip. Fools!!
967575210399420416 2018-02-24 01:41:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump It's the best place for you on Faux News. You've got your knickers all twisted up and need a release? Throw the red meat to the base while Mueller keeps plodding along. Prove you aren't #PutinsPuppet by imposing the Russian sanctions. Can't do it, can you?
967547708901703680 2018-02-24 23:52:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump It's funny how you always say "No collusion. No collusion."; but never say "no money laundering, no pimping for foreign dictators, no Russian loans, no fixing GOP platform for Putin. Also what is NOT FUNNY is your refusal to impose the Russian sanctions. #PutinsPuppet
967395329162199042 2018-02-24 13:46:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoeNBC I posted a picture of Emma Gonzalez on Facebook yesterday and said "This is the face of the future. A bad ass young woman, unafraid to speak truth to power. Poised, articulate and deadly serious. Be very afraid, GOP." And she's just one of these amazing kids! What an impact!
967394066416656385 2018-02-24 13:41:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Why is it taking so long? My "Q" clearance at DOE to be a secretary for a group of nuclear scientists took only 3 mos. I had no Russian bankers for the FBI to talk to. @realDonaldTrump the whole rotten lot of you can't pass a security clearance or get a U.S. bank loan. Telling.
967390166246604800 2018-02-24 13:26:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Let's talk about Jared's security clearance. I had to get a "Q" clearance to be a secretary for a group of nuclear scientists. The FBI talked to everyone I had every known. It took 3 months. I didn't have any Russian bankers! Do you all launder? Asking for a country.
967389234561626114 2018-02-24 13:22:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FLOTUS @robreiner @lauren_hoggs Keep speaking truth to power, Lauren!! The First Lady only does what she's told to do. As for her step-son, @DonaldJTrumpJr clearly models the behavior he was raised with. He bullies anyone he can't debate...and that's pretty much everyone! Go, kids, go!!!
967386474403454976 2018-02-24 13:11:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Another example of GOP extreme vetting? Or, did she check too many boxes to not run her?
967384853745291264 2018-02-24 13:04:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RuthMarcus Keep up the great work, Ruth!! You must have struck a nerve to merit a cute nickname!!
967031201792864257 2018-02-23 13:39:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I just heard that one shooting survivor said they should re-name the AR-15 as the Marco Rubio, as both can be bought easily. What say you, @marcorubio ? Need some water? Your dreams of becoming a POTUS some day have encountered a few roadblocks. Go, kids, Go!
967029636092764162 2018-02-23 13:33:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Is she wearing her MADE IN CHINA shoes & handbag? Zero economic patriotism. And just like her father, unfit to "lead" anything related to my country. She can't even manufacture a single product in the USA? Yeah, let's Make China Great Again!
967019422895370240 2018-02-23 12:52:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @politico Smoking pot is legal in my state. Beating your wife is not. Fun Fact: We elected the local pot shop owner to our City Council in 2017 in the RED ZONE. My 28 year old niece knew no other name on that ballot but his. Millennials are coming for the GOP in 2018!!
967015053961527296 2018-02-23 12:35:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump This is how you comfort a nation. Amazing Grace. Not hateful rhetoric intent on dividing Americans.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S58k3ZXRJJc
967011765010575360 2018-02-23 12:22:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Yeah, but it doesn't fit with @realDonaldTrump and @DonaldJTrumpJr tin foil hat conspiracies to rile up their base. And, they MUST divert attention away from the 32 count indictment of former Trump Campaign Chair. $30 million is a lot of dirty Russian laundry. Nyet?
967007120133537792 2018-02-23 12:03:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Your father's tweet speaks for itself. Dana Loesch's words are available online for your sheep. Of course, they won't watch it because they are mushrooms who prefer to live in the dark and be shitholed on. You Trumps are such cons! Hurry the hell up Mueller!!
967003178993463296 2018-02-23 11:48:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NBCNews Was @IvankaTrump wearing her MADE IN CHINA shoes & handbags? Zero economic patriotism. Make China Great Again!!
966988962052022272 2018-02-23 10:51:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @HuffPost And she'll be wearing her MADE IN CHINA shoes & handbags. Make China Great Again, @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump. Nyet?
966854921596235776 2018-02-22 01:59:11 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @marcorubio How about the law enforcement officer in charge of protecting that school who did not engage the shooter? He resigned from the Sheriff's Department today. Perhaps he knew his pistol was no match for an AR-15! And, @realDonaldTrump wants to arm the Home Ec teacher? Insanity!
966851770918961152 2018-02-22 01:46:40 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @funder @StopTrump2020 Go, kids, Go! @realDonaldTrump is a coward at heart (#BoneSpurs), just like the angry white men who need an AR-15 as an extension of their manhood. Keep the pressure on. Register. And, vote them out!!!
966835622164905985 2018-02-22 00:42:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Yeah, I hear that the Sheriff's Department deputy assigned to that school ran away and has now resigned. So, why do you think the Home Ec teacher would do better when the deputy with the gun wouldn't take on an AR-15? Get rid of the weapons of war!!!
966792162087075840 2018-02-22 21:49:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Damn @realDonaldTrump 32 count indictment!! You really know how to pick people to work for you. Or, was he placed there by Putin?
966791375940337664 2018-02-22 21:46:40 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Thank You, General!! While you might be a Richland H.S. Bomber and I'm a cross-town rival Kamiakin H.S. Brave, I stand and applaud you and your respect for all who want to serve in our military. Tri-Cities WA proud!!
966739570258685952 2018-02-22 18:20:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SenWhitehouse @JimInhofe @PressSec Fine by me. That said, public/private partnerships make corporations rich and taxpayers get the shaft!!
966693182053298176 2018-02-22 15:16:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Well, duh!!
966692999756365824 2018-02-22 15:15:46 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoyAnnReid A 13 year old white boy was arrested when his middle school shooting plot was discovered in a nearby community of less than 12k population. Not inner city...Red Zone of WA State. How does LaPierre explain that? He can't, so he'll ignore it.
966689201319116801 2018-02-22 15:00:40 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Hey! Did you see your May 22, 2016, tweet:   "Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!"  We're confused...which DJT is lying?
966686050243375104 2018-02-22 14:48:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec Will @IvankaTrump be providing you with some of her MADE IN CHINA shoes & handbags? ZERO products made in USA? What's up with that? I won't be watching either of you women who lie and enable an unfit POTUS who is in Russia's pocket!!
966685344648146944 2018-02-22 14:45:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TeamUSA @IvankaTrump Hey, Barbie! Will you be rocking your MADE IN CHINA shoes & handbags? Zero of your products have MADE IN USA labels and you have the nerve to call yourself a patriot? Nyet!!
966681630965288960 2018-02-22 14:30:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @VP @kasie Wow...just effing WOW!
966681345320615936 2018-02-22 14:29:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Funny how past tweets come back to haunt someone who tells so many lies that he can't keep them straight. Unfit POTUS! According to recent Quinnipiac poll: American voters say 57 - 41 percent that you are unfit to serve as POTUS. 70 - 22 say the 18-34 year olds.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/966679493208346624
966676981789028352 2018-02-22 14:12:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Please tell us that you aren't giving special "chain migration" status to your in-laws while railing about it in your immigration proposals. Wouldn't that be a "liddle" hypocritical of you? Stop the guessing...tell the American people the truth!!
966663167022481409 2018-02-22 13:17:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Tell the VA & military to tag those who shouldn't have weapons, like my niece's 100% PTSD disabled ex-husband who has an arsenal and is crazy. We carry copies of the restraining order, but paper won't protect us.
966661961755738113 2018-02-22 13:12:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Gawd damn, son, you have lost it!! Spinning so hard to avoid taking on the NRA. Gutless. Coward. John Roberts was right when he asked Sarah if you had any ideas of your own. Nope. Nada. Zilch. Also, no heart, no brain, no courage. Almost like living in Oz.
966657417328041984 2018-02-22 12:54:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I'll believe it when I see it. @realDonaldTrump is a master showman, a coward at heart who lacks the balls to take on the NRA. Young people 18-34 have his number: 70% unfavorable!! Own it, Donnie!
966654839382945792 2018-02-22 12:44:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit. Those teachers would be killed the minute law enforcement showed up to an active shooter situation and saw them with a gun. Of course, you have been bought and paid for by the NRA, so I have no confidence that you will do ANYTHING. Smoke & mirrors!
966651860005175297 2018-02-22 12:32:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nbc @CNN @realDonaldTrump I have listened to the experts who say that when law enforcement arrives to an active shooter situation, they will take out anyone they see with a gun. Dumb Trump idea!!! Ban assault rifles & bump stocks, raise age to 21, mental health & background checks. Don't be dumb!
966649111658209280 2018-02-22 12:21:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @QuinnipiacPoll @Morning_Joe Did you see your numbers @realDonaldTrump. Thank God our young people are smart, can spot a con a mile away and aren't going to be led around by the nose like your sheep. @marcorubio needs to smarten up or his numbers will look like this too!! No NRA $$$!!
966647244446343169 2018-02-22 12:13:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump I have many friends who are teachers. One said she would quit teaching if they are required to learn to be a soldier. They have to buy school supplies for their classrooms because there is no money; but you'll spend $ on guns for them? Asinine!!!
966646489060528128 2018-02-22 12:10:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @ananavarro Yeah, he showed up; but his answers did not endear him to these students and parents. @marcorubio needs to find some courage to reject NRA money and do the work necessary to protect our kids. Otherwise, I see some political changes coming to FL. Go, kids, go!!
966505337120419840 2018-02-21 02:50:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @politico Will @IvankaTrump rock her MADE IN CHINA handbags and shoes? Will she be hawking said MADE IN CHINA handbags and shoes? Is there a Trump Hotel to promote? I have no interest in watching this little rich girl "lead" anything. Zero economic patriotism!
966447775272484864 2018-02-21 23:01:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @maddow Of course @realDonaldTrump needs to be prompted and reminded how to react as a human being with feelings. I found him quite lacking and empty of ideas.
966365690369261569 2018-02-21 17:35:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid I'm 60 and as a young girl was deeply impacted by the images I saw on my TV of the Civil Rights movement. I felt chills watching this morning. My favorite? 4 Pillars. Chills. Go, young people, Go!!
966325389810286592 2018-02-21 14:55:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @robreiner Friendly amendment: Just like his son-in-law, he couldn't get a security clearance either! I needed a "Q" clearance (DOE's top secret) to be a secretary for a group of nuclear scientists on the Hanford Reservation. It took the FBI only 3 months. I didn't have any Russian bankers.
966317300243574784 2018-02-21 14:22:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @gdebenedetti @politico McMoRo has a viable challenger in former WA State Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown. Recent polling shows Lisa within 4 points. Lisa has the intelligence, legislative experience, fundraising chops and grit to take McMoRo on and beat her. Go, Lisa!!
966315928441954305 2018-02-21 14:17:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Sept 2016: Comey & FBI arrived in a caravan of black SUVs for a meeting with 12 key members of Congress, including the leadership of both parties. Mitch McConnell, voicing skepticism that the underlying intelligence truly supported the White Houses claims, did nothing! Nyet?
966312079622680576 2018-02-21 14:02:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @danmericaCNN When I worked as a secretary in the 70s for a group of nuclear scientists on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, I needed a Q clearance - DOE's version of top secret. The FBI talked to everyone I had ever known and it took only 3 months. I didn't have any Russian bankers.
966310807892930561 2018-02-21 13:57:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Yeah, that @DonaldJTrumpJr is a chip off the old inhuman block. He's now pretending to be a world affairs expert as he hawks Trump Company in India. Stay strong, young people! Sane Americans are standing with you!! I'll be marching where I live in the Red Zone.
966306708153802752 2018-02-21 13:40:46 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NaveedAJamali @MalcolmNance I posted this on Facebook where I have many family and friends who are Trump supporters. I asked them if they too had shared "Being Patriotic" content in 2016. No replies yet this morning, but I hear keyboards clicking in their search for "Being Patriotic". Duped.
966290524993830912 2018-02-21 12:36:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC @CNN @realDonaldTrump Tell us instead why Jared has no permanent security clearance and is allowed to handle classified info. When I worked as a secretary in the 70s at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, the FBI contacted EVERYONE. A "Q" clearance that took three months! I had no Russian bankers!
966111465575923712 2018-02-20 00:44:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoyAnnReid @thedailybeast @realDonaldTrump did you see this? 37th flip since your inauguration! I love flipping...legislative flipping...congressional flipping...Mueller flipping. Flipping!!
966071496748630016 2018-02-20 22:06:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC Go, young people, go!!!!! Sane Americans have your back. Keep fighting and make sure you register and you vote. The ONLY thing some (not all) of these legislators/members of Congress will comprehend is when they are defeated at the polls!!
966053056931442688 2018-02-20 20:52:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NBCPolitics Impose the sanctions @realDonaldTrump. @PressSec - I would hate to have your job having to lie to the American people...every fricking day. You all need to come clean!!
966020469685026816 2018-02-20 18:43:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FoxNews @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump Shut the hell up and go to work, you Russian tool. You are a sexual predator that Evangelicals and Faux News chooses to defend. We all know what the Bible says about false prophets. You ain't nothing but a bought man who refuses to fight for his country. Russian tool!!
965963141254283276 2018-02-20 14:55:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @SRuhle Spoken from the heart of a mom. Thanks, Stephanie! I have buried a child and know there is no greater pain. These people have no shame...and no hearts! It will always be about them and them only.
965962537459056641 2018-02-20 14:53:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoyAnnReid @MalcolmNance And it's not even Friday, Malcolm! A Russian-linked lawyer, I hear. Do tell. Keep breaking it down for us!
965960744851288064 2018-02-20 14:46:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @IvankaTrump My state's now retired Treasurer had this to say when I posted about your daddy's infrastructure plan: "public/private partnership flim flam..... Private side gets rich and the public gets screwed!" He then laid out real examples of just that happening. Corporate pigs @ trough.
965955898068750337 2018-02-20 14:26:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Prove it by imposing those sanctions, you Russian tool!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI5IA8assfk&index=5&list=RDGMEMQ1dJ7wXfLlqCjwV0xfSNbAVM6vE5ewvxdfo
965937933080383488 2018-02-20 13:15:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How thankful am I that my state has a bi-partisan Commission that does the redistricting? No funny business allowed. Pennsylvania got caught gerrymandering their districts and have been ordered to fix it. How about telling Russia to stop their meddling, you Russian tool?

965926507704082432 2018-02-20 12:30:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump He's up and dividing America already! When a POTUS doesn't criticize the country who attacked us, when a POTUS won't impose bi-partisan Congressional sanctions against Russia, when a POTUS won't say a bad word about thug Putin, We are NOT winning, you Russian tool!!

965919028941172736 2018-02-20 12:00:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @AriFleischer I don't give a shit if they spent $46 or $46 million. They meddled is a U.S. election. Full stop. Patriots don't excuse that. Patriots don't try to convince the sheep that there was no crime. Patriots impose Congressional sanctions. Patriots don't love Putin. Trump is no Patriot!
965917726152650755 2018-02-20 11:55:06 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @HuffPost @DonaldJTrumpJr isn't qualified for a damn thing. Neither is @IvankaTrump nor @EricTrump. They are privileged rich kids who shouldn't be anywhere never our government. And, how about Kushner negotiating middle east peace? They are all a joke!
965778627324395520 2018-02-19 02:42:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Have you imposed those Russian sanctions Congress passed yet? Have you put a plan in place to thwart Russia from interfering again in 2018? If not, you are derelict in your duty & should be impeached! You are an illegitimate POTUS who protects Russia at every turn. Resign!
965777157204029442 2018-02-19 02:36:32 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Charter announces it will pay employees $15, raised my monthly rate $30 last week and blocked Fox coverage of Daytona 500. Guess who is paying for your tax break for the rich? Little people. RICH, RICH, RICH laughing all the way to the bank.
965776626121293824 2018-02-19 02:34:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec My cable/internet company announced it's pledge to pay all employees $15, raised my monthly rate $30 last week and blocked Fox coverage of Daytona 500. When people start doing the math, they will realize who will actually pay the bill. Not rich people!!
965593454356017152 2018-02-19 14:26:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I won't be celebrating you this day. Should you decide to take your oath of office seriously, you would impose the Russian sanctions, stop attacking everyone, stop obstructing the investigation, acknowledge Russia helped elect you & do something to prepare us for next time. Fake!
965565055575052288 2018-02-19 12:33:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @GOPLeader I won't be celebrating the current occupant of the Oval Office. If he can't protect us against enemies foreign & domestic, he is NOT an American President. He won't impose Russia sanctions Congress passed. WHY? Because he's been bought & paid for!
965554862837530624 2018-02-19 11:53:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump  So much for your oath to protect us against enemies foreign & domestic. Russia isn't laughing...it's crowing about the successful purchase of an American President who won't put Congressional-approved sanctions in place or prepare states for the next one.
965396063380168704 2018-02-18 01:22:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NASCAR @RCRracing @austindillon3 @DonaldJTrumpJr My NASCAR-loving brother went to watch it on Fox & my internet provider blocked access. He asked me what kind of BULLSHIT is this? I told him to watch the news more often. Oh, and my provider raised my rate $30 a month to pay for their employee bonuses. Bullshit says it all!!
965329647973031936 2018-02-18 20:58:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Oh, about that. My little Trump-loving brother went to watch it and it has been blocked. He asked me what this bullshit was about. I told him net neutrality and rich people wanting to soak it to the little guy & make them pay more to watch. He told me to tell you BULLSHIT!!
965247390256054273 2018-02-18 15:31:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Pop Quiz: 1) Mental disorders are hereditary, 2) Trump in meltdown panic mode, 3) Junior doesn't understand campaign world "op research" 4) Mueller proves crimes committed,  5) All of the above!!
965232466523926529 2018-02-18 14:32:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TheRickWilson I just told my Facebook friends who are not on Twitter that they are missing out on the meltdown of an American President. Keep the smart commentary rolling, Rick!
965231390693273601 2018-02-18 14:27:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump My state's now retired Treasurer had this to say when I posted about your infrastructure plan: "public/private partnership flim flam.....

965227613697355777 2018-02-18 14:12:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Don't expect @realDonaldTrump to do a damn thing to protect my country. He has been bought and paid for by the Russians. He's not going to arm the states with the tools they need to protect our democracy. He's a Russian tool!!
965227161601716225 2018-02-18 14:11:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump When Mueller releases his "next" round of indictments and you start pardoning people, the GOP will finally have to figure out whether they are on the side of the American people OR the Russians. We know whose side you are on. Put those sanctions in place, you Russian tool!
965222487851073537 2018-02-18 13:52:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JRubinBlogger I was just thinking the same thing. He is losing it this weekend and makes one wonder when the final meltdown will occur.
965222056173252608 2018-02-18 13:50:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Just stop, for Gawd sake!! You are insane!!
965221938632126464 2018-02-18 13:50:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @kylegriffin1 How much does each stay at a Trump property cost the taxpayers? Is the invoice @realDonaldTrump sends to the American people for payment to HIM broken out by expenditure? Golf, meals, hotel stay, porn star fling installed on property and does he tip for "services"?
965220657003872256 2018-02-18 13:45:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Nailed it, @JRubinBlogger!!
965206374685720577 2018-02-18 12:48:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You are the perfect tool for Putin! Not very smart. You don't read or digest information. You won't impose sanctions on them no matter what they do and you are driven entirely by ego. No, you were a horrible candidate with help from Russia!! Illegitimate POTUS!
965204573857054720 2018-02-18 12:41:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Why are you working so hard to put up roadblocks at every turn if you're not guilty? Do you owe Russian mobsters $$? Can't get a bank loan in your own country. Money laundering? Is that why you warned Mueller to stay away from your finances & won't release tax returns? Dirty Don!
965200332698435585 2018-02-18 12:24:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FLOTUS How about teaching your husband to be kind? He dishes division, racism & hatred daily and you stay silent? I hope you are getting paid a lot more than what your husband's lawyer paid the porn star. Not enough $$ in world to let that pig touch me!!
965049192283439105 2018-02-17 02:23:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley Why wait until the next time? Donald Trump needs to man up & impose the Russia sanctions Congress passed. Several state voter files penetrated by the Russians. Trump has done NOTHING to prepare the country for the next time. Illegitimate POTUS who is in Putin's pocket!
964987224193253376 2018-02-17 22:17:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump He said "in THIS indictment". There is more to come. More money laundering charges for Manafort, but Gates stuck around the campaign after he left. Why? Gates is now cutting a deal with Mueller, as are so many. Lock the whole rotten lot of you up!! Illegitimate POTUS.
964986147628658688 2018-02-17 22:13:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @POTUS @PressSec LOL, Sarah!! Russia hacked our election. Full stop. @realDonaldTrump's ego can't stand to hear that his election was not his alone to crow about. Put the sanctions in place that Congress passed!! What are you people hiding? So many Russians everywhere you look, nyet?
964861403470348288 2018-02-17 13:57:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @EricTrump How inappropriate to be promoting another Trump property and your father while a nation grieves. Will you be the sole surviving Trump when they "Lock Them Up"? I guess being the clueless one has its benefits! On the other hand @DonaldJTrumpJr is complicit!!
964856173215211520 2018-02-17 13:36:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Did you hear that @realDonaldTrump? incontrovertible: adjective 1. not able to be denied or disputed So, when will you finally enforce the Russian sanctions Congress passed? Oh, your BFF Putin won't let you? Fake POTUS.
964849291519959041 2018-02-17 13:09:31 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump It's too bad that you lack the courage to answer their call for action. Seeing that grieving mother screaming "Do Something. Do Something. Do Something" stays with a normal person who cares. NRA POTUS/GOP Congress = blood $$$ from NRA!pic.twitter.com/GGEEQEeekM
964720109091635200 2018-02-16 04:36:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Okay @SpeakerRyan let's make it about the kids and the teachers. Sobering to imagine heaven having a school shooting section made up exclusively of American children and teachers. NRA and their campaign $$ is all you care about!! Shame. On. You.pic.twitter.com/esas2cjjK1
964697999015231488 2018-02-16 03:08:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump apparently does mass shooting victim comfort like he does fast food - in and out in 20 minutes?
964641325416001536 2018-02-16 23:23:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @11thHour @TheLastWord @MalcolmNance Having dinner tonight with Trump supporting family members who have laughed at my Russia posts. Little sister and I are going to have some fun before, during and after the pinochle game! Perhaps we will have our phones tuned in so they don't miss the GOOD!! :) :)
964637374352207872 2018-02-16 23:07:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Have you not read the charging documents & the subsequent news of the identity theft guilty plea from an American? Those indictments are chock full of how Russia helped Trump. And how helpful to have Russian bots boost your Release the Memo nonsense! Lock who up?
964625551561408512 2018-02-16 22:20:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump So many bread crumbs for Mueller to follow. So many Trump people with Russian connections. So many Trump tower meeting questions for Junior. Bannon spends 20 hrs with Mueller. Gates cutting deal with same. Me thinks you doth protest too much! Lock who up?
964563906457841664 2018-02-16 18:15:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec Will he now address this: A federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment on Feb. 16, 2018, against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities accused of violating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes."
964563326045847552 2018-02-16 18:13:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Breaking: "A federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment on Feb. 16, 2018, against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities accused of violating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes."
964563092272107526 2018-02-16 18:12:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Cannot believe that a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment on Feb. 16, 2018, against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities accused of violating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes." Nyet?
964483729300180993 2018-02-16 12:56:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec Speaking of cowardly...look in the mirror, Republicans!! You will do absolutely nothing to prevent these mass shootings in the future. Cowards who do the bidding of the NRA. Campaign $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
964227238907469824 2018-02-15 19:57:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Oops...I assume some of them are "good people". Another white supremacist with a gun. Not a good guy with a guy. A racist with an AR-15!!!https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/nikolas-cruz-trained-with-florida-white-supremacist-group-leader-says/ar-BBJbaFh
964226101315686400 2018-02-15 19:53:11 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump Still waiting for you to explain Melania's parents' immigration status. What are you hiding? Do they not fit in with your messaging about immigration? Would your base not like the answer?
964154484938088450 2018-02-15 15:08:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump So, if that's the case, why did you undo Obama's gun checks for people with mental illness?https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-signs-bill-revoking-obama-era-gun-checks-people-mental-n727221
964152747615404032 2018-02-15 15:01:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Inquiring minds want to know the immigration status of Melania's parents. Why is the White House refusing to release this information? Could it be there are "issues" there? Also, the migrant workers needed to harvest the crops in my area would never be issued "merit" from you.
964151321828802565 2018-02-15 14:56:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump My friend isn't on Twitter, but she asked me to send you a message: Violence is not a product of mental illness. Violence is a product of anger.
964141936578719745 2018-02-15 14:18:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How about not letting this disturbed young man even have access to an AR-15? Why do you leave it up to teachers to save our kids? Because you and the GOP are gutless and have been bought lock, stock and barrel by the NRA. Time for another assault weapons ban!!!
964139349615853569 2018-02-15 14:08:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill STFU @marcorubio or start acting like a human being. Another white guy with a gun ends the lives of 17 people and you say let's not jump to conclusions? Bought & paid for by the NRA, Rubio!
964138120185696257 2018-02-15 14:03:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec I won't hold my breath that he will say anything that matters. We send our kids to school hoping that their teacher will find a way to save them while the GOP refuses to do a goddamn thing but take the NRA $$$ and run. Sick of it!!
963943541381591040 2018-02-14 01:10:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @GOPLeader DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! The GOP is in the pocket of the NRA and you will do absolutely nothing. I've buried a child. There is no greater hurt inflicted on a parent. Quite likely you will do nothing and keep cashing those NRA checks? $$$$$$$$
963403337549856768 2018-02-13 13:23:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Wouldn't it be great if we had a President who could say the words: Domestic abuse is unacceptable in my White House. Don't trot sad @PressSec out before the world to read meaningless words. We want to hear YOUR words from YOUR mouth. I won't hold my breath.
963037615027978241 2018-02-12 13:10:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC @Morning_Joe Do you see these numbers @realDonaldTrump? Will @PressSec & @KellyannePolls spin these numbers to have us believe that you support women? Only those GOP women who would also trust their daughters with Roy Moore believe Trump supports women! Eyes wide open!!
963033596846985217 2018-02-12 12:54:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Is there an actual plan or are you trying the public/private partnership flim flam? You even want to privatize the Space Station? You overspent the budget on a corporate tax giveaway & have no $$ left for roads & bridges? Watch your SS & Medicare. Trump is coming for it!!
962881051587575808 2018-02-11 02:48:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TIME @realDonaldTrump I hope you read this!! What a piece of work you are!!
962794223979266048 2018-02-11 21:03:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RepMarkMeadows LOL...LOL...If @realDonaldTrump really was sincere about protecting sources & methods, he would not have authorized the release of the Nunes memo over the objections of the FBI. And, who didn't want the FBI to brief them? Yes, that would be the GOP. Nyet?
962793575598645248 2018-02-11 21:00:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, who is the one who is constantly telling his supporters it's fake news? Sexual abuse. Spousal abuse. Racism. Pedophilia supporter. Russians hacked & penetrated several states. 4 of your team indicted SO FAR. Yeah, it's all "fake news". Only ignorant sheep believe that!!!
962711377520476160 2018-02-11 15:34:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @amjoyshow @JRubinBlogger you are a force too wise and experienced to allow these GOP women to try their transparent "messaging" to avoid saying they are the face of women who refuse to face the evidence on this President. You give me hope for GOP women!!
962679039251984384 2018-02-11 13:25:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JRubinBlogger He is one of the few honorable people in this administration. I said recently that I could name many Rock Star Dreamers in my community & that Jim Mattis could as well. He's a bit of a hero here & has a beer with regular folks when he comes home to answer call to jury duty. Hero.
962663229758435329 2018-02-11 12:22:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Sad to say that some women lack the self-respect needed to leave. @PressSec leads the pack with her "justification" for everything Trump does or says. Wife beaters are right there with pedophiles; but @realDonaldTrump loves them all. He is a sick man, unfit to be POTUS.
962472381313826816 2018-02-10 23:44:32 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Actually, wasn't George Bush still the President in 2008? And, Democrats only controlled Congress 2009-2010. Why can't you EVER get anything right? Perhaps you should turn off Faux News and read something For Gawd Sake!!
962409574375419904 2018-02-10 19:34:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Of course @realDonaldTrump has something to hide. And, House Republicans under the "leadership" of @SpeakerRyan continue to play key roles in this attempt to hide the truth from the American people. Oh, and they beat their wives over there and blame the women. Meow, Nov '18!
962385406409912320 2018-02-10 17:58:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump In other words, their memo provided the context the Nunes memo intentionally left out in order to manipulate your narrative. What are you hiding, Donnie? I think it goes way beyond Obstruction. Does Mueller have your tax returns? PeePee tape? Call me curious. Nyet?
962372896092925952 2018-02-10 17:09:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump What say you now? Yes, Bruce, he's got a lot of fucking nerve. But, at heart, he is a coward. All men who abuse women are cowards. This one is the King of Coward. Let's throw him a parade!https://twitter.com/LukaBrazzi/status/962357288752226304
962296776685379586 2018-02-10 12:06:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill WTH @realDonaldTrump You hire only the very best wife beaters? How come so many of your team STILL don't have security clearances? What else will be revealed about the reasons? This WH is a joke of incompetence and bad behavior. Soiled by the stain of Trump!!
962098538745233408 2018-02-09 22:59:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @WMTWTV @SenatorCollins I just got a letter from them telling me that my cable was being raised another $30 a month. I call b.s. that they are using their tax savings to pay people. Yes, pay them $15 or more; but don't jack up your prices, which causes people on fixed income to pay, and claim credit!!
962064832458457090 2018-02-09 20:45:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @Tesla @ananavarro Thankful for Tuesday and the wonder Americans still feel towards space. Stuck that landing!! As for the rest of the week, nice to know the President and all his men think a wife beater needs a good send off and the victims of this man get doubted by the POTUS. Sick!
962026241296494592 2018-02-09 18:11:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NBCPolitics Thanks @realDonaldTrump. How about the women? How about the wives he beat? Women who continue to support you have no self-respect. I'm looking at you, @PressSec to tell us why this is okay. WWJD? Embrace the wife beater?
961942868855209985 2018-02-09 12:40:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Wow! Donald Trump had a twice-accused wife beater in a key White House staff position - one who lacked a full security clearance. WHY IS THAT! @PressSec will tell us we can't know why because it's "personnel issues". No, it's another cover-up!
961936467432849409 2018-02-09 12:15:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RajShah45 @PressSec Perhaps this video should be mandatory viewing in Trump's White House. General Kelly needs a bit more education, but let's start with this!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PscD6h1iNiI
961935738131464195 2018-02-09 12:12:06 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoyAnnReid It is time for General Kelly to exit the building. Keeping a twice-accused wife beater as your staff secretary tells me the measure of the man.
961754011157151744 2018-02-08 00:09:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Thank You, General! I said recently that I knew some Rock Star Dreamers in my community & also knew that our home town guy Mattis would have the same. He continues to be one of the few who serve with honor in this train wreck administration.
961678513014153216 2018-02-08 19:09:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @dcexaminer @DonaldJTrumpJr Is there a catalog somewhere that recaps all of your conspiracy theories? It really is hard to keep up. Oh...and did you see, Junior, that they really want you to come back to Congress for a public hearing? Fun and games, nyet?
961607447151456258 2018-02-08 14:27:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan And, you Mr. Speaker, do nothing as Russia continues to attack my country. I am sick of you blaming Democrats for everything. You are in charge. You have the majority in house, senate and white house. You own every action or inaction (Russia sanctions). Own it!!!
961594942316425216 2018-02-08 13:37:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CillizzaCNN Primila Jayapal is bad ass and has never feared speaking truth to power. That's why Washington State sent her to Congress. Ask Rep. Don Young about his experience with her. Go get 'em, Pramila!!
961592329827008512 2018-02-08 13:27:31 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RWPUSA When the FBI tells the White House that one of their inner circle staff has been accused by not one, but two ex-wives, that he is a domestic abuser and the WH just shrugs. It takes a black eye photo to force them to act? Don't preach to me, you fakers!! Beyond mulligans!!
961567719501041664 2018-02-08 11:49:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump WWJD? He would tell you that he is deeply disappointed in you and the Evangelicals who surround you/make excuses for you. Mulligans? How many are they willing to give you for your sexual misdeeds? How many is Melania willing to give you?
961362089053859840 2018-02-07 22:12:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump About those Russian sanctions? Oh, too busy demanding a military parade like Vlad? I don't recognize my country these days. GOP is the party of sheep with @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr with not a single ball between them. Nyet?
961265157455282176 2018-02-07 15:47:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump So, about those Russian sanctions you refused to implement? Sorry to bother you about it when you're busy planning a military parade like BFF Vlad gets, but you need to pay attention!http://komonews.com/news/nation-world/russian-hackers-target-boeing-in-hunt-for-high-tech-us-secrets
961246349109870592 2018-02-07 14:32:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump loses again! If Republicans were smart, they'd ask him to zip it for the next 9 months. Oh, they have been ordered to organize a military parade for our dictator wanna be to "honor" him for his 5 draft dodging bone spurs? I don't recognize my country.
961245228236615681 2018-02-07 14:28:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr @skphillips1982 France doesn't have a five-time draft dodger demanding a parade to "honor" HIM. Not to honor the men and women who serve us around the world. To "honor" HIM. That is disgusting and not the norm for my country.
961239743643099138 2018-02-07 14:06:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr I hear your daddy wants a military parade to "honor" him. The world's best dictators do as well. Give a military parade to a five-time draft dodger? Instead, let's give a parade with all contractors, students & workers stiffed by Trump grifters. #BoneSpurParade
961228208082337792 2018-02-07 13:20:38 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Pay your damn bills @realDonaldTrump. I think we should indeed give you a parade...one made up of all the contractors, students and workers you have stiffed over the years. A military parade would only work for you if you had ever served. You did not. #BoneSpurParade
961224496517595138 2018-02-07 13:05:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan A buck fifty! A buck fifty! A buck fifty! It is crumbs when your boss gets millions and gives you a BUCK FIFTY!
961007253259141120 2018-02-06 22:42:38 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoyAnnReid Nailed it, Joy! I know a few DACA kids and I couldn't fit their education and community awards into the limits of a Tweet. I have become incredibly disappointed by Kelly. The other General (Mattis) is from where I live and likely could tell you this as well. Rock stars!
961005517052063745 2018-02-06 22:35:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan He'd be ashamed of you apologists!! A lot of blue collar workers supported the Gipper because they believed he was a patriot. They are ashamed of you too, Paul.
960871348187705344 2018-02-06 13:42:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump Would someone please tell him he came across as a third-world dictator? I am not required to "clap" for you. The flag isn't you. The constitution isn't you. The Rule of Law isn't you. Respect is earned. You soil the presidency with every unfit word.
960854618417737728 2018-02-06 12:36:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Let's see the Trump tax returns. You are SO ABOUT transparency - selective transparency. Would the tax returns show money connections to Russians? Does Mueller have them? Money laundering? Oh, and pay your damn bills. Aren't you in charge? Grifters!!!!
960852167513919488 2018-02-06 12:26:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump "We don't live in a dictatorship or a monarchy.

960648373404495873 2018-02-05 22:56:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @ABC Well then, @PressSec, tell him to stop trying to take credit for every bounce in the market like he's God's gift to the economy. He rode the Obama economic wave and took credit for every bit of it. Karma and financial markets can be a bitch. Own it, comrade!!!
960615048480608256 2018-02-05 20:44:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Speaking of going down...have you seen the Dow? How come you take credit for the increases, but stay silent when it plunges? Down 1,000 points? Own it.
960564443468869632 2018-02-05 17:23:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @dcexaminer @DonaldJTrumpJr Get a job, Junior! You have way too much time on your hands. Tin foil hat conspiracy theorists love this stuff, while intelligent, informed Americans just laugh and make sure the champagne is chillin for Mueller time. Release Trump tax returns & prove no Russian $$. I dare you!!
960558016859746304 2018-02-05 16:57:32 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump LOL...LOL...LOL!! He will go down as the twenty-first century til foil conspiracy leader and will be scorned in history books. Only your ignorant sheep believe any of this fantasy, comrade. Nyet?
960529249659531265 2018-02-05 15:03:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CharlesMBlow Exactly. I was thinking back to my Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl victory and how some got a little carried away, started fires and destroyed stuff. You didn't see the city or its people being attacked. Perhaps it is because there are so many Norwegians there? The bias is real.
960516067398361090 2018-02-05 14:10:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill It doesn't matter. He didn't tweet this to make a case in court. @realDonaldTrump only goal is to keep the sheep liquored up and snarling. I had a "friend" tag me in a far-right wingnut thread this weekend. That'll show the "liberal feminist". Yawn. No brains, only bullies!!!
960514543309828096 2018-02-05 14:04:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill First they embraced racist sexual predator Donald Trump. Then came racist pedophile Roy Moore. Then racist Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Now they are going to embrace a Holocaust denier? The GOP is the party of racists and perverts!! @SpeakerRyan - Is this one of "your guys"?
960503072437907456 2018-02-05 13:19:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Gawd, you are a piece of work!! Will you allow yourself to be interviewed by Mueller even though your lawyers fear you will commit perjury? I say we hook you up to a polygraph and see who the liar is. It won't be any of the patriots you just impugned, comrade Trump!!
960490985405915136 2018-02-05 12:31:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump No Brady Super Bowl win to celebrate, so the liddle man goes back to his original playbook of "fake news". It is pathetic and unfit for an American POTUS to act this way. And, beyond sad that your "fans" lack the intellectual curiosity to fact check you. Nyet?
960327741445820416 2018-02-04 01:42:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr You do you? Is that kind of like Bud Light's Dilly Dilly? I guess it does not matter when you are living in the alt-right conspiracy Twilight Zone, nyet?
960163320958402560 2018-02-04 14:49:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec @krixworld @MasterMorgan317 @DiogenesLamp0 Sadly, too many of Trump supporters will take his and Sarah's word for it and won't do their own fact-checking. I hope they will eventually wise up, Until then, they will keep being fed bull***t while being told it's a Snickers bar. Sad.
960155726864789509 2018-02-04 14:18:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec @krixworld @austin_su So now you are going to try to shame me for wanting the U.S. President and his family to show some economic patriotism by putting Americans to work? He's the one who wants to put America first, nyet? As for trade "deals", he's being outmaneuvered by, well, everyone!

960139654669324290 2018-02-04 13:15:06 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec So, Sarah, when do the Trumps announce that they are moving THEIR foreign sweat shop jobs to the U.S.? Ivanka's crappy shoes & handbags made in China? Trump's products that fill his hotels & resorts made in places where workers have no rights. Hypocrites!
960132761741701121 2018-02-04 12:47:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @ABC @DonaldJTrumpJr. Please explain: Over the past half year, I have had the privilege to serve as an informal advisor to the staff of the Kremlin, Carter Page wrote in a 2013 letter. Your extreme vetting also failed to sniff out Flynn, Manafort & Papa's Russia ties. Sloppy!!
960122178883665920 2018-02-04 12:05:40 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill How clueless is @SpeakerRyan. A buck fifty? Isn't he the guy who went to college on his late father's Social Security? The same guy who now wants to cut SS & Medicare? No worries, here's your buck fifty!! What a joke this man is.
959832214438424576 2018-02-03 16:53:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I could be petty & point out that there's a glaring typo. Their/there/they're. I know it must be hard for you, having gone to/too/two (multiple choice) the "best schools". I was an Army Corps of Engineers gypsy kid who went to 11 different schools, yet I learned it. Stable genius
959829483313246209 2018-02-03 16:42:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NicolleDWallace I just had to share this on Facebook, Nicolle!! You've got spunk, intelligence and information that bots can't keep pace with. Keep up the great work!!!
959817659008233472 2018-02-03 15:55:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DevinNunes @SpeakerRyan @latimes @AmbassadorMaga I'll be spending my time helping elect true patriots instead of wasting another second debating with people who would rather insult than debate. HAGD
959815460425379841 2018-02-03 15:46:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DevinNunes @SpeakerRyan @latimes @AmbassadorMaga And, I'm supposed to take you seriously when bots drove the hashtag #ReleaseTheMemo? Not a goofball at all. I have 5 sitting state supreme court justices on my client list. I do politics for a living and have seen a few stunts misfire over the years; but this one was a hoot!!
959811662764154885 2018-02-03 15:31:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DevinNunes @SpeakerRyan @latimes @AmbassadorMaga LOL...LOL...LOL #YoMemo shows them to be what they are. People who put Party before Country. Or, am I totally missing the point reading remarks from one Republican after another who are mocking #YoMemo. Wake up. Your POTUS has broken the law.
959800701802110976 2018-02-03 14:48:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump #YoMemo is a joke! Cherry picking and leaving out needed context may work to scam your ignorant sheep; but not one of us with functional reasoning skills believes a word of it. Can't wait for Nov to take majority away from you. And, then what? Impeachment of our Russian asset.
959799495541207041 2018-02-03 14:43:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @latimes Looking pretty bad there, @SpeakerRyan. How dumb do you think we are? You need to remove @DevinNunes to restore even a sliver of integrity. If not, we'll see you in November - even in the Red Zone where we just elected the local pot shop owner to city council. Millennials rock!!
959795815978909696 2018-02-03 14:28:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC @POTUS @AliVelshi I've repeatedly told Trump that he should not include WA St in his wage victory laps. We raised our minimum wage $11.50 - $15.45 with family leave and didn't have to give corporations a dime. That minimum wage drives up other wages. And bonuses are not raises.
959788333596524544 2018-02-03 13:59:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL...wasn't that @DevinNunes a funny punch line? Talk about a nothing burger. #YoMemo is going to keep us laughing until your next stunt. If @SpeakerRyan cared about transparency and fairness, he'd remove Nunes as Chair. He doesn't, so we'll have to show him in Nov!!
959786965771075585 2018-02-03 13:53:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC @RepMarkMeadows - you are as big a joke as @DevinNunes. Why don't you GOP guys cool your jets and let Mueller do his job? I watched your interview and laughed out loud. Where do they get these people? What a joke! Tin Foil Wars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
959783880210366465 2018-02-03 13:41:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @DevinNunes is so bought and paid for by Trump. He'll do anything to stop the Russia investigation. He needs to lose his chairmanship, @SpeakerRyan. How is it possible for him to be fair? It's not! The American people will not tolerate this bullshit you are spinning.
959782230271787008 2018-02-03 13:34:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DeadlineWH @MSNBC We're on to your games @realDonaldTrump. That Nunes memo was a stunt and nothing else. It has already backfired on you. Now, Hannity is paving the way for pardons of your team who have committed crimes. Think that women's march was big? Think HUGE!
959780003788480512 2018-02-03 13:25:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec Giving bonuses is corporate America's way to avoid paying a living wage. We have $11.50 - $15.45 minimum wage in the other WA - done by citizen's initiative at ballot box. We didn't have to give corporations a dime. P.S. Don't include WA St in your wage #s. You did nothing here.
959559956226654208 2018-02-02 22:51:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SenJohnMcCain Thank You, Senator McCain. You are one of the few real patriots in the GOP. Their actions to undermine the DOJ and FBI to protect @realDonaldTrump is telling. Same w/ @SpeakerRyan role in this "campaign". Oversight, my ass!! Obstruction!
959554635152244736 2018-02-02 22:30:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @GOPLeader You'll pay dearly at the ballot box for this overreach in attempt to undermine & muddy. 4 different federal judges approved Carter Page surveillance. If Trump fires Rosenstein, you will be complicit in a constitutional crisis that seeks to protect our a lawbreaker POTUS!
959518998273540096 2018-02-02 20:08:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Oops...have you checked the Dow lately? Down 600 points and still moving down. You love to crow about its gains, but stay silent when it goes down. Convenient.
959469554287038465 2018-02-02 16:52:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TIME As a mother who lost her teenage son to severe epileptic seizures, please open your hearts and minds to alternatives that have shown great results!!
959447832020238342 2018-02-02 15:26:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @funder #RemoveNunes  I resist on behalf of my late grandfather whose years as Chief of Police & Civil Defense Regional Coordinator during the Cold War would look @DevinNunes - and say WTF, dude!! Are you crazy or a traitor? #RemoveNunes
959395125045608448 2018-02-02 11:56:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You expect us to believe this grand conspiracy involving Carter Page? He's a Russian asset who you brought on board your campaign. What are you hiding/trying to cover up? This investigation ain't going away; but a few of you are!!
959391368668835840 2018-02-02 11:41:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump News Flash: Your SOTU falls a few million short of the record; but your sheep believe it. Some of them may be "fine people"; but most lack the critical thinking skills needed to process your lies. Yes, lie after lie after lie! Most unfit POTUS in history! Nyet?
959042912204988417 2018-02-01 12:37:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TIME No Kennedy Center Honors. No White House Correspondent's Dinner, No sports teams wanting to visit the WH. No first dog. The lack of class, caring and even music is so telling with this man. @realDonaldTrump Do you know what they say about dogs who alert to evil? They ain't sheep!
958903045726728192 2018-01-31 03:21:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr Would those emails be yours? LOL...seems like there was a good reason why Corallo left. One of few people with integrity who weren't willing to break the law to protect you and your father. Nyet?
958876189929517061 2018-01-31 01:34:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @PressSec - No, having the American taxpayers pay the Trumps for them to stay at their own resorts is a "waster of taxpayer money". Trumps are grifters!! So, how about Obstruction of Justice? Is that a hoax as well? Facts tell us otherwise.
958874844942053376 2018-01-31 01:29:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec That's cute, Sarah! @DonaldJTrumpJr has spent the entire day on Twitter bashing Democrats. He really needs to get a "real" job like the rest of the world. I work with Republicans all the time and none of them act like the Trump grifters. They are offended by them. Nyet?
958827461084553216 2018-01-31 22:20:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @greggutfeld @DonaldJTrumpJr Yeah, that "unity" the fake POTUS talked about was b.s. Trump looks like a guy that Putin has something on. Something BIG. #ReleaseThePeeVideo How sad that my country has been taken over by people who are beyond sick and depraved. No morals in the whole rotten lot!
958722068610240512 2018-01-31 15:22:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump How is draining the swamp going? It seems you can't find people to serve in your administration who aren't corrupt.
958721132349202432 2018-01-31 15:18:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nypost @DonaldJTrumpJr Just curious whether or not you have a job. You are on Twitter non-stop promoting your father. Aren't you supposed to be running the business? You know, the one where you manufacture your crap in foreign sweat shops. Nyet?
958720560179105792 2018-01-31 15:16:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Do you not understand the charts & graphs of the U.S. economy over the last 9 years? You inherited that economy from the black POTUS you racists think was born in Kenya. He showed you his long form, so show Trump tax returns. What are you hiding? Can't get a U.S. bank loan?
958719692083929088 2018-01-31 15:12:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Hey, Barbie. Did I miss the announcement last night that the Trumps are moving their manufacturing to U.S. soil? No? You are still gonna make your crappy shoes and handbags in China? Hypocrite grifters, those Trumps. Zero economic patriotism!!
958719268157181952 2018-01-31 15:11:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr How about Trumps move their manufacturing from foreign sweat shops to the shores of the good old US of A? All of your Made In China labels show you for the grifters you are. How many jobs for American workers have Trumps created? NONE!!! Hypocrites!!
958717940097953792 2018-01-31 15:05:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Hardly, Junior. Democrats have a hard time accepting racist, sexist con men as our leaders. Your dad ain't no leader. He's a bully. I'll believe he supports family leave when I see him signing the bill. Until then, it's just words. Nyet?

958344348420030465 2018-01-30 14:21:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NicolleDWallace @Comey You know we are in an alternate reality when the son of a cop who worked for my grandfather when he was Chief of Police refuses to believe that Russians meddled or Trumps peddled. Both of those cops are rolling over in their graves, saddened by the GOP attack on our democracy.
958325506847330306 2018-01-30 13:06:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump is a bully who isn't fit to be POTUS. He also refuses to allow the new sanctions against his BFF Putin. Trump is a racist thug who can't get a loan from a U.S. bank. No problem, says Russia. We got ya.
958122512126103552 2018-01-29 23:39:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr You are still on the hook for that Trump Tower meeting, Jr. Comey is still a witness. McCabe is still a witness. Mueller is still there. GOP is complicit in Obstruction and attempting to cover up for the rich guys who don't think they have to follow the rules. Think again!!
958121684761952256 2018-01-29 23:36:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RepMarkMeadows #ReleaseThePOTUSPeeTape!! GOP - enjoy your majority because you won't have it after November's elections. Complicit!! Obstruction!! No Justice from GOP!!!!!
958121093411123200 2018-01-29 23:34:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @DevinNunes is complicit. The GOP can try to protect @realDonaldTrump by destroying our institutions; but the voters will protect those institutions by taking the GOP out of the majority in Nov. Comey is still a witness. McCabe is still a witness. Trump obstruction!!!!!!
958064444285714432 2018-01-29 19:48:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nikkihaley Don't watch then. Go talk to the thugs of the world who arrest their political opponents who your boss admires. Free speech is still allowed in Trumpistan. At least until we have a constitutional crisis.
958046055781711872 2018-01-29 18:35:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr And...the Trumps are laughing all the way to Deutsche Bank to deposit the American taxpayers' checks for jetting around almost exclusively to Trump Properties so they can bilk the taxpayers for their personal gain . Nyet?
957984593549774848 2018-01-29 14:31:40 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DavidCornDC Doh!! I am loving Twitter this morning!! Nunes is a shoe-in for Trump MVP!
957984040593715200 2018-01-29 14:29:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @Scaramucci @FoxNews Trump inherited this economy. Also, we in the other WA have $11.50 - $15.45 minimum wage and paid leave. We didn't pay corporations $1.4 trillion to do it. We did it by initiative at the ballot box. Please do not include those WA St gains in your column. You did nothing!
957619811902668800 2018-01-28 14:22:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Any comment on Putin arresting his opponent, POTUS? Of course not! You were king shithole of the "lock her up" crowd, were you not? Even that Flynn guy chanted it on stage. I hear he flipped and is working to help lock YOU up instead. Oh, the irony!!
957606758108680192 2018-01-28 13:30:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump So, please me how Trumps are celebrating their tax windfall. I haven't seen any announcements from any of you about moving your manufacturing to US soil. Your daughter's crappy handbags and shoes still carry Made in China? Trumps are grifters!!!
957605864671649792 2018-01-28 13:26:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Always trying to take credit for the former black POTUS economy, Donnie? You remember, after reckless Wall Street and banksters (the ones who won't give you a loan) tanked the economy and the black guy had to come in and fix it. You inherited it, comrade!! Nyet?
957593862804987904 2018-01-28 12:39:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @AP @realDonaldTrump - Is Putin still your hero? Arresting your opponent sounds like something you would do. Nyet?
957592881019015168 2018-01-28 12:35:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Did someone say "Obstruction"? If anyone knows how to do it, it's comrade Trump! Are you the only POTUS in U.S. history unable to get a bank loan in your own country?
957252201704955904 2018-01-27 14:01:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Thank You, @NicolleDWallace! The damage being done by these people is jaw-dropping. I am heartened that at least I can fight beside the moral Republicans on this one. I share your/their words on Facebook to challenge my GOP friends and family to choose wisely.
957245627234009088 2018-01-27 13:35:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NBCNews How do you know you were a successful single mom? When your phone goes ding, ding, ding with a text from your son with the news that Murphy's coming back. A feminist-raised son who works 60 hours, cooks for a family of six and can iron a shirt better than his mom! Potato/Potatoe
957239968371322881 2018-01-27 13:12:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoyAnnReid This man is clueless! My son makes dinner 99% of the time for his family of six. He works 60 hours a week, does laundry and cleans house. He's also the one who texted me with the news of Murphy Brown. I guess he turned out just fine being raised by a single mom. Potato/Potatoe
957237678029729792 2018-01-27 13:03:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @EricTrump Didn't your daddy predict GDP would be 4-6%? He missed!! His obsession with beating everything Obama did is telling and sad. Only insecure racists go after our country's first black POTUS. Nyet?
957232905272487936 2018-01-27 12:44:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump The drug dealers don't have to climb a wall to get in. Check out the drug seizures by our Coast Guard (didn't you cut their budget?). Will you propose a wall in the Pacific Ocean as well? Who would you propose pay for that one? So dumb, those sheep!!
956646696678694913 2018-01-25 21:55:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Did Spooked Kushner ever get his security clearance? What is taking SO LONG? So many meetings with Russians? So many business dealings with Russians? I guess it's how rich people who can't get loans from American banks do their laundry...I mean their business.
956543147974172672 2018-01-25 15:03:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN My phone went ding, ding, ding last night with a text from my 36 year old son with the news. I was that single mom Dan Quayle talked about. My son turned out great, is raising 4 kids, a project manager at his company and still loves Murphy Brown & his Momma Bear.
956534356356382720 2018-01-25 14:28:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe What a joke some Republicans like @SenRonJohnson are who would take our country down a path of ridiculous conspiracy theories instead of standing up to Russia by preparing us for the next time. How low will the GOP go to protect this unfit @POTUS? Time will tell, Americans!!
956529619171131392 2018-01-25 14:10:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN The only joke is those Republicans who are mistaking the American people for Trump's ignorant base who believe all they are spoon fed. Tin foil, anyone?
956334068181876736 2018-01-24 01:13:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Do you mean "mayors"?
956192806099329024 2018-01-24 15:51:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @SecretaryPerry. Instead of spending your time promoting oil, could you come to Hanford Nuclear Reservation again? That first tour was just spit and polish. We've got radioactive shit leaking, vapors detected near state hwy and workers sickened. Hear about it? You are a joke!
956191792201834496 2018-01-24 15:47:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN @megynkelly should go back to Faux News. Most of them aren't journalists either. Bad hire once again @NBCNews. I refuse to watch anything she is on. Give me REAL women journalists who aren't bomb throwers! No class, Ms. Kelly!!
956186226972819456 2018-01-24 15:25:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan Breaking news, Paul!! Here in the other WA, we have $11.50 - $15.45 minimum wage with paid leave! We didn't have to give corporations $1.5 trillion in tax breaks. In fact, we didn't give them a dime! We did it by citizen initiative at the ballot box. And, FYI, our economy rocks!
956173775896158209 2018-01-24 14:36:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics @GOPChairwoman So, it's casual conversation for a POTUS to 1) ask for a loyalty pledge from Comey and then 2) who the next FBI Director voted for? You confuse the rest of us clear-thinking Americans with Trump's ignorant base. It's Mueller Time!!!!!
956169433856196608 2018-01-24 14:18:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @IvankaTrump Just curious if you have moved YOUR shoe & handbag manufacturing to U.S. soil. Or, will you continue giving jobs to the sweat shop workers in foreign countries? Jobs, jobs, jobs for China, Vietnam & Indonesia. You have "fake" patriotism, Barbie.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Szmw0Hkr8
956165628850667521 2018-01-24 14:03:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Just curious if the Trumps have followed suit. Have you all moved your manufacturing to the U.S. soil or are you still using foreign sweat shops? In the other WA we have $11.50 - $15.45 min wage & didn't have to give corporations a dime. We did it at the ballot box. Buckle up!!
956015238058459136 2018-01-23 04:06:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TIME How wonderful to have @AnnCurry as a great example of journalism and class to show Ms. Kelly what that looks like. NBC made a big mistake with their hire of Ms. Kelly. They've made a few of them!!
956013661327310848 2018-01-23 03:59:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Getting a little close to the inner circle with your daddy now in the queue for a Mueller chat? Oh, and did I hear that your daddy asked for a loyalty pledge from yet ANOTHER FBI Director? Lots of Russia news today. It's Mueller Time!!!!!
956013219289559040 2018-01-23 03:58:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Did you ask ANOTHER FBI Director for a loyalty pledge? When is the Mueller interview? Will you continue to call it fake news after you're facing not one, but two obstruction of justice charges? It's Mueller Time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
955856585254825984 2018-01-23 17:35:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC @POTUS @mitchellreports @VP I saw you stand in front of our troops (not your troops, not @realDonaldTrump troops, but the American people's troops) and use them as political staging on foreign soil to weigh in on a partisan basis. I'll be so glad when it's Mueller time. Sessions, now Pence?
955811585414475777 2018-01-23 14:36:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DavidCornDC Yeah, I hear those Evangelicals give "mulligans" for extra-marital sex with a porn star after porn star wife gives birth. And another for the hush money. I'm Catholic and would still be in the confessional if that was me.
955808367351537664 2018-01-23 14:24:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @ananavarro Spot on, Ana! I posted this on Facebook this morning and even my Republican friends are reacting in horror to this. @realDonaldTrump - If you can't act like an American President, then resign. Enough banana republic antics! This man used YOUR best words!!
955801049834569729 2018-01-23 13:55:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Actually, they got the GOP to release the CHIP hostages like my 5 year old autistic nephew that you could give two shits about. Listen to @LindseyGrahamSC and get rid of Stephen Miller on immigration. No white supremacist/Nazi should sit at that table.
955772134973833216 2018-01-23 12:00:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @EricTrump Anything sold there with a Made in USA label? Come on, Eric, show us the labels of all of those Trump products made in...pretty much everywhere but the USA.
955603711924961280 2018-01-22 00:50:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @HuffPost She retains her Faux News persona and is a major turn-off for me. @megynkelly I watched 10 minutes of you and knew you had nothing to offer. NBC made a terrible mistake signing you. Your rhetoric doesn't belong on NBC.
955600284046131201 2018-01-22 00:37:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Americans - don't forget that the GOP held my 5 year old autistic nephew hostage for months with CHIP, as well as blocking the motion to pay the military during the shutdown. We will remember in November!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sQ0UySKYKM
955586505220567040 2018-01-22 23:42:31 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoyAnnReid Don't get caught up with bots or fellow Democrats who fail to understand that there are next steps. I am beyond thankful that my 5 year old autistic nephew will have his CHIP; but I remain ready to fight for DACA kids. Let's go!!
955564918824030208 2018-01-22 22:16:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SenBobCorker Let's talk inappropriate, shall we Bob? Holding my 5 year old autistic nephew on CHIP hostage was/is inappropriate. Heartless & immoral to cause fear and worry for families like mine. We will remember in November!
955451095676940289 2018-01-22 14:44:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NicolleDWallace I'm a liberal Dem, but I watch your show every day. It is refreshing to hear moral Republicans stand for truth and democracy. Keep up the great work!!
955450488891195393 2018-01-22 14:42:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @davidaxelrod Because he has white supremacist/Nazi Stephen Miller doing the heavy lifting. I mean, 239 pounds for the puppet master to manipulate is heavy lifting! @realDonaldTrump would rather be golfing; but puppet duties require him to stay put until the young racist is done.
955449583705837569 2018-01-22 14:38:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SecNielsen It was Republican leader McConnell who blocked paying the troops. As for immigration, get white supremacist/Nazi Stephen Miller out of the negotiations!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sQ0UySKYKM
955445089983119360 2018-01-22 14:20:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan Tell @realDonaldTrump to get Stephen Miller out of the middle of negotiations. How embarrassing is it to have a white supremacist/Nazi in charge? Puppet master Miller and COS Kelly are the impediments to solving this.
955440837101367296 2018-01-22 14:03:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr @LindaSuhler Republicans have been holding my 5 year old autistic nephew on CHIP hostage for months now and you have the gall to blame Democrats? As for the military, who are you kidding? McConnell killed it!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sQ0UySKYKM
955440194278236160 2018-01-22 14:01:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MeetThePress @realDonaldTrump has put his white supremacist/NAZI in charge of immigration negotiations and we should expect any result other than failure? #TrumpShutdown
955439520714964992 2018-01-22 13:58:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr @TomCottonAR Are you a Russian bot or the real deal? Hard to tell these days with Russian bots driving the social media presence on your "talking points".  I'm real. So is my 5 year old autistic nephew you've held hostage for months now to give you the "needy children" CHIP spin. Shameful!!
955438564078010368 2018-01-22 13:54:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle I keep trying to tell him that, Stephanie; but he seems not to WANT to listen. People have even posted the video of McConnell objecting to McCaskill's motion to pay the military; but with Stephen Miller in charge of the WH and working the POTUS puppet strings we are doomed.
955437007320244224 2018-01-22 13:48:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @ananavarro Amen, Ana! In addition to withholding military pay so they could add them to the hostages used for spin, they've held pregnant women & kids like my 5 year old autistic nephew hostage for months now. #TrumpShutdown
955436069851312129 2018-01-22 13:44:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Junior - we in the other WA have a booming economy, a minimum wage $11.50 - $15.45 and we didn't have to give a DIME to corporations to do it. We did it by citizen initiative at the ballot box. Speaking of the ballot box...it's going to be ugly for GOP this year. Nyet?
955435269011881990 2018-01-22 13:41:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @morningmika @JoeNBC @JoyAnnReid Perhaps @realDonaldTrump shouldn't have put a white supremacist/Nazi in charge of immigration. Perhaps @SpeakerRyan shouldn't have used pregnant women and kids like my 5 year old autistic nephew as hostages! This is #TrumpShutdown
955434454163513344 2018-01-22 13:38:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan Did you use the kids on CHIP like my 5 year old autistic nephew as a weapon in this shutdown? Of course your did, Mr. Speaker. Kids and pregnant women held hostage by the Republicans. Shame on YOU! #TrumpShutdown
955430151591944193 2018-01-22 13:21:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr You are babbling, Jr. The only reliable sources you have speak Russian. Nyet?
955429441219342336 2018-01-22 13:18:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump If you would show Stephen Miller the door, we might get somewhere on immigration. You put a white supremacist/Nazi in charge of immigration and you expect to have success? Give him the boot like you did Bannon & Gorka. #TrumpShutdown
955429000817487872 2018-01-22 13:16:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @SpeakerRyan Don't forget to haul out the kids and pregnant women on CHIP. My 5 year old autistic nephew won't be used by the deplorable GOP as a hostage. As for the military getting paid, don't forget to mention that McConnell killed that motion. #TrumpShutdown
955428304936361985 2018-01-22 13:13:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh, so someone told you about it? LOL, Jr.
955420465735991297 2018-01-22 12:42:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @DonaldJTrumpJr Could you introduce us to a few of your friends? Always Russia, Russia, Russia with the Trumps. I get it, you gotta keep the money men happy! No one else will loan Trumps money but thugs. Hurry the hell up, Mueller!!! #TrumpShutdown
955419537926574080 2018-01-22 12:39:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Don't forget they've been using pregnant women and kids like my 5 year old autistic nephew as hostages for months now, knowing they would need those kids as a bargaining chip. They also blocked paying our military during the #TrumpShutdown. Shameful GOP!!!
955418414725578755 2018-01-22 12:34:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @GStephanopoulos @ABC The only game playing, @PressSec, is Republicans holding my 5 year old autistic nephew hostage for months now to use CHIP as weapon in negotiations. Talk about game playing when you put a racist/Nazi in charge of immigration negotiations. Dead Eyes Miller needs to go!
955417079041019904 2018-01-22 12:29:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr @SRuhle Love it, Stephanie. He's likely to tell us that the Aenate "past" a bill last night. Like father, like son.
955415558194839552 2018-01-22 12:23:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOPChairwoman Republicans have been using my 5 year old autistic nephew who is on CHIP for months now as a hostage. They've had months to re-new it, but didn't because they knew they could use those kids down the road. As for the military, watch this people!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sQ0UySKYKM
955415168791425024 2018-01-22 12:21:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Republicans have been using my 5 year old autistic nephew who is on CHIP for months now as a hostage.

You have had how many months to re-authorize CHIP; but Nooooooooooo, you needed my 5 year old autistic nephew as a hostage. Shameful! #TrumpShutdown

954443254539345920 2018-01-19 19:59:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @Marcshort45 @realDonaldTrump @HallieJackson Oh, never mind. That was the black POTUS he was talking about. When it comes to 2018, with GOP controlling WH, Senate & House it's a whole different story. At least Obama could spell. Pro tip: He was a POTUS in his "past" who "passed" some legislation. Stable genius, my ass.
954358093013372928 2018-01-19 14:21:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr You are repeating yourself, Jr. Are you frenzied? Why doesn't @realDonaldTrump release his tax returns and prove he has no Russian thugs in the mix. Distract. Deny. It doesn't bother Mueller a bit. He just keeps plodding along, hand-delivering grand jury subpoenas. Nyet?
954357254043590656 2018-01-19 14:17:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Whine. Whine. Whine. Is Mueller getting a little too close with Sloppy Steve joining Flynn & Papa? This is your new distraction now that grand jury subpoenas are being delivered. Really "just" a 20 min meeting? Obstruction, conspiracy, money laundering and the beat goes on!
954355745826291712 2018-01-19 14:11:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan You crack me up, Paul!! Only blind ignorant fools (like your base) would believe that nonsense. You OWN every majority there is! The problem is that you are INCAPABLE of leading & governing.
954354663645564928 2018-01-19 14:07:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL. At least you spell better than that stable genius father of yours. The GOP controls House, Senate and White House. Not my problem if they can't get their #shitholeGOP act together. You break it, you own it. Nyet? Oh, and speaking of Russians..LOL!!!
954345348599709696 2018-01-19 13:30:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @ananavarro I am so enjoying the blistering replies to #PresidentLoco "past", instead of "passed", from our stable genius. My morning fun!!
954340645593800704 2018-01-19 13:11:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Do you mean that it "passed"? Such a stable genius!! Your Party controls House, Senate and WH. Nice attempt to deflect blame on the minority party. Lame!!
954315022057947138 2018-01-19 11:30:06 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan LOL LOL LOL...Hasn't anyone told you yet that Republicans also control the Senate? Don't blame Democrats for your own inability to get anything done.
954001961979801601 2018-01-18 14:46:06 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL, Junior. All I can seem to find in my feed is news of the subpoenas for Steve Bannon and more ink about loans from Russians. You confuse us "eyes wide open" Americans with your blind sheep. Mueller is going to conclude his investigation soon. Grand jury, ya know? LOL
953990971334602752 2018-01-18 14:02:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NaveedAJamali Don't tell Jeff Sessions; but we elected a pot shop owner to Kennewick City Council. Yes, that's in the reddest of Washington State's Red Zones. The tax revenue helps my community and keeps the cartels out.
953989810569428993 2018-01-18 13:57:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CillizzaCNN The GOP has been using CHIP as a bargaining tool for months now. My 5 year-old autistic nephew is thankfully unaware of the games being played with his health and future. He's still in pull-ups, so perhaps @SpeakerRyan will take on the diaper duty.
953987124520402944 2018-01-18 13:47:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Stop the presses!! I agree with you on something. The only thing. My 5 year-old autistic nephew wants to know if someone out there cares about his future. It is yet to be proven that the GOP cares. He's been waiting for months while GOP uses him as a bargaining chip. Sad!!!
953981192335839232 2018-01-18 13:23:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Are you and your COS have difficulty communicating? Mitch McConnell wants to know what you want because NO ONE KNOWS. Yeah, you are like a broken record about Mexico paying for a wall through NAFTA reform, yet no one believes that for a second, 239! Nyet?
953974799063179265 2018-01-18 12:58:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Republicans are leaving Congress in droves because of you. And with viable challengers lining up to take on the rest, it's going to be a rough mid-term election for GOP. Buckle up, 239, it's going to get bumpy!! Jiggle time!
953963736150224897 2018-01-18 12:14:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RepMarkMeadows @Morning_Joe You look really foolish trying to blame Democrats for anything when the GOP controls the White House, the House and the Senate.

Did you hear about Steve Bannon's subpoena by Mueller to testify before the grand jury about Russia? Some of us have not lost our minds & see the handwriting on the wall. Russian handwriting. Nyet?
953392850565185536 2018-01-16 22:25:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Sorry, Junior, but that "Do you know who the President of the United States is?" does not constitute a true mental evaluation. BUT, at 239 pounds, with a BMI index of 29.9 - .1 shy of OBESE, yo daddy needs to step away from the Big Macs and walk the golf course for a change
953382884915560448 2018-01-16 21:46:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CillizzaCNN @GovMikeHuckabee He passed; but his 29.9 BMI is .1 away from being obese. Perhaps the POTUS should knock off the Big Macs and milk shakes and try walking a golf course for some exercise!
953367006903877632 2018-01-16 20:43:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CBSNews Did he just say "evidence-based"? I thought that was one of Trump's banned words.
953273572826390530 2018-01-16 14:31:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Whine, whine, whine! Perhaps you should step away from Fox & Friends and see what the rest of the world has to say. Did you not see the Der Spiegel cover? If not, here is why you get no respect. Oh, and the African nations have had a little to say of late. You own it all!!pic.twitter.com/I9UlcPsuw8
953253239859814400 2018-01-16 13:10:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan In the other WA, we have a minimum wage of $11.50 - $15.45 and paid family leave. We didn't have to give corporations permanent tax breaks and increase the debt $1.5 trillion. We did it by citizen initiative at the ballot box. Speaking of which, buckle up, #ShitholeGOP
953240414105972736 2018-01-16 12:19:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Put up or SHUT UP. Release the tapes and prove you didn't say it. I dare you. You won't because you know you said it and so do the complicit #ShitholeGOP who were in the room. Release the tapes!!!!!
953239754539024384 2018-01-16 12:17:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @HouseGOP @GOPLeader is the biggest suck up I've ever seen. How dare you even mention MLK when you protect a racist POTUS & give him candy. Buckle up, #ShitholeGOP, your 2018 is about to get rocky! 439 show up in WA CD5 for 1st volunteer academy (in January). McMoRo will get beat!
953027640222351360 2018-01-15 22:14:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How flippant and uncaring are you about the lives of so many people and families? And...did you see that cover of Der Spiegel? This is what the world thinks of the new American POTUS. We are the laughingstock of the world!!pic.twitter.com/aUcho6KFMu
952927054277693440 2018-01-15 15:34:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CBSNews The silence of the religious right speaks volumes. These are likely the same people who supported a racist, pedophile Roy Moore. They have no morals that Jesus would recognize. I'm hopeful for the future of our country that millennials abhor racism.pic.twitter.com/f0qi7rxWBR

Original Vikings fan from my Dakota days when dad taught his girls football; so it was an easy call to go for Vikings all the way!! Well done!

952910031955091456 2018-01-15 14:27:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan Your words once again fail to address the elephant in the room. @realDonaldTrump has been boasting about how his shithole/shithouse comments are rallying his base. #ShitholeGOP P.S. Millennials abhor racism. Mid-terms are gonna rock! @cathymcmorris count down to early retirement!
952897715515641861 2018-01-15 13:38:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I hear you bragged about the uproar over your shithole comments. If you were serious about AMERICA FIRST, Trump product labels wouldn't say "MADE IN CHINA". ZERO economic patriotism from our racist POTUS & his kids as they laugh all the way to Deutsche Bank! Nyet?
952545365537865728 2018-01-14 14:18:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RandPaul @chucktodd Perhaps you should tell that president NOT to be a racist, Senator! We are embarrassed every day by this unfit, racist man. Future history books will not look kindly on the #ShitholeGOP who made excuses for the #ShitholeInChief. Mid-terms are gonna rock!!!
952542384578953217 2018-01-14 14:06:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Walmart looks pretty shithole to me. $11? Minimum wage is already $11.50 - $15.45 in WA St. We didn't have to give $1.5 trillion in corporate tax breaks to raise our minimum wage. We did it by citizen initiative at the ballot box. Speaking of which, buckle up buttercup!!!
952185008394924033 2018-01-13 14:26:11 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Who threw a Twitter fit because the deal didn't meet your ego needs - even though your words in that meeting said otherwise? You also got the FISA stuff effed up. In addition to not understanding the path a visa applicant goes through, you dropped a shithole! What a week!
952183565399220224 2018-01-13 14:20:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Thanks, @MichaelSteele. I have shared this on my Facebook page where I have a bigger impact with family and friends who are Republicans. They have told me that they've never seen the "family liberal" share so many Republican words. Country above party is required.
951888458636644352 2018-01-12 18:47:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump #Shithole is the real slogan of #StableGenius!!
951805064154292225 2018-01-12 13:16:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Five tweets in an hour...you are again showing your unfitness to be the leader of our country when you constantly lie and divide. I keep hoping for a Lonesome Rhodes unmasking of #45 on live TV.
951798076070510592 2018-01-12 12:48:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @jaketapper Did you see this @realDonaldTrump? Will @PressSec try to convince us that you were telling the truth? Sick of the lies! Sick of the shithole POTUS who embarrasses us daily with his racist lies!
951614860311150592 2018-01-11 00:40:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump You owe the American people an apology and the countries you called shitholes. Prove you have an ounce of decency and apologize. If not, the world will continue to look at you as a racist. Apologize!!
951561862990065664 2018-01-11 21:10:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @politico For Gawd Sake, @PressSec!! That must be the reason why our intelligence experts were freaking out and scrambling this morning to clarify the latest insanity from the resident "stable genius". Don't confuse the rest of us with your blind, ignorant sheep!
951553514764775424 2018-01-11 20:36:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TheMarkPantano Minimum wage is already $11.50 in Washington State. Does that mean those workers will get a raise as well? Some cities are $15. We didn't have to give corporations $1.5 trillion in tax breaks in order to raise our minimum wage. We did it by citizen initiative. Catch up, America!!

951425807456468999 2018-01-11 12:09:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec 69 percent say he is not level-headed and 57 percent believe he is unfit for the White House, 59% disapproval rating, 56% give F or D failing grade and 63% say he is not honest. Even with economy, they give greater credit to Obama than Trump. Tell all the numbers, Sarah!
951421880153460738 2018-01-11 11:53:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Aren't you going to list the other numbers? 69 percent say he is not level-headed and 57 percent believe he is unfit for the White House, 59% disapproval rating, 56% give F or D failing grade and 63% say you are not honest. Now that's some MAGA!
951419702839881728 2018-01-11 11:45:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump thinks he is above the law - again!! If he's innocent then he shouldn't mind giving Mueller an interview - under oath! Only guilty people cover up, obstruct and deflect while blaming others for their crime.
951417886618169344 2018-01-11 11:37:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump When Christopher Steel went to the FBI to notify them that crimes were being committed, they told him that they were already aware from someone in the Trump camp. Oh, and did you see the new Quinnipiac Poll numbers? Ouch!!!
951209488228368384 2018-01-10 21:49:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Seriously, dude? You would be THAT PETTY? You are the example of why we have to force Republican businesses to pay workers a living wage. @FoxBusiness - Look west to Washington St if you want see what paying people a better wage does to a state's economy. Boom!!
951123124120051712 2018-01-10 16:06:38 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Wow...now you're ordering a political party to take control of the investigation that will show you and your comrades playing footsie with the Russians? Americans should be horrified. Republicans should choose carefully. We are watching and the GOP should be put on notice!
951110246784626688 2018-01-10 15:15:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump If Congressional Republicans weren't trying to bury this investigation, Patriot Dianne Feinstein would not have needed to do so. Republicans who are complicit in the cover-up and obstruction are traitors to the American people. Russia is still meddling and you ignore. Nyet?
951101113389924352 2018-01-10 14:39:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NicolleDWallace I really like her spunk & willingness to ask tough questions and push back when someone tries to spin instead of answer. I'm a liberal Dem and my profile picture of my suffragist grandmother and her future proper bridge club ladies show I come from spunky! Keep it real, Nicolle!
951098502016217088 2018-01-10 14:28:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Rule of Law! Rule of Law! Oh, and while I've got your attention, tell your WH staff to fix yesterday's official record of your bi-partisan immigration meeting. They left out some of your "best words". Fix it!! We can't trust your WH with its constant lies!!
950905697469788162 2018-01-09 01:42:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CharlesMBlow Amen!! How thrilled was I to see the upcoming cover of The New Yorker! As a proud 12, having our beloved Seahawks @mosesbread72 as one of today's civil rights leaders made me beyond proud. I tweeted back at Trump this morning and included the cover preview.pic.twitter.com/4CXpxCbwZT
950707801508085760 2018-01-09 12:36:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr He forgot the words, Jr. Why are you posting THAT as an example of how to show respect? Perhaps next time he wants to put #TakeAKnee protesters in their place, he should do so only if he knows the words to our anthem. Nyet?
950706979407712256 2018-01-09 12:33:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec @Scavino45 Yeah, I saw that. How embarrassing that the President of the United States can't remember the words to our national anthem!! And, what was up with him repeatedly patting his heart with his hand? Faux POTUS shouldn't preach about our national anthem, nyet?
950700247562334208 2018-01-09 12:06:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump If you want the national anthem respected, you might want to learn the effing words! What an embarrassment you are, not to mention a hypocrite! I'll bet that these guys know every word of that anthem! Don't preach to us when you don't even know the words. Faux POTUS!pic.twitter.com/UJgL7SSVMB

950374911700119553 2018-01-08 14:33:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I hear you have quite a bit of "executive time" built into your schedule. Instead of tweeting to intimidate the DOJ into investigating your enemies like DICTATORS DO or dreaming up fake news awards like DICTATORS DO, might I suggest you do something FOR the people and resign?

She's everything your father isn't. A self-made billionaire who actually started with nothing who is intelligent, compassionate, respectful, articulate, trustworthy & she's SANE!!
950343021748367362 2018-01-08 12:26:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill So, what are you angling for @LindseyGrahamSC? Free lifetime golf at a Trump resort? You have become a major disappointment by selling your soul to the devil. If you think it will help your run for POTUS in the future...Meow!!!
950167920268607488 2018-01-07 00:51:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Absolutely disgusting behavior for the President of the United States. Your con may be fooling those blinded to the truth; but the rest of us sane Americans see right through you. We are saddened and sickened by the mockery you have made of our country.

949633045199384576 2018-01-06 13:25:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoeNBC How fun for Americans again this morning to have the world see our President's raging narcissistic personality disorder on display. I told him "You sound like a Valley girl...a 7 year old Valley girl who thinks it's cool to say "like". Star? Honey Boo Boo!"
949627617296044032 2018-01-06 13:04:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Gawd, @PressSec, your boss is tweeting again this morning & proving his mental instability with each raging narcissistic personality disorder tweet. Hitler too had his defenders and mouthpieces to cover up his insanity. History will not look kindly on Evangelicals like you.
949623473889935361 2018-01-06 12:47:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Gawd...more evidence for your competency hearing. Genius...are you effing kidding me? Go find your new Christmas Legos and let the world enjoy at least one calm day without your insanity. The world is watching and laughing at the once greatest nation on earth. Good job!
949621841034805249 2018-01-06 12:41:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Exhibits #1 & #2 in upcoming psychological evaluation. 1) "It's always about you" being one of the symptoms of raging narcissistic personality disorder and 2) You sound like a Valley girl...a 7 year old Valley girl who thinks it's cool to say "like". Star? Honey Boo Boo!
949613983094288384 2018-01-06 12:09:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You inherited a strong economy. Obama's final year job numbers surpass your first year job numbers to demonstrate that FACT. He beat you again!
949612689617182720 2018-01-06 12:04:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I have never seen an adult whine as much as you do about the tiniest little perceived slight. Man up and stop crying like a baby. Isn't your wife responsible for the online bullying campaign? It, like everything else in that WH, it's all one big con.
949608679111733248 2018-01-06 11:48:46 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @ABC I want them to look in the eyes of those of us who have lost a child to severe epileptic seizures and tell us you refuse to save other kids. Mine was only 13. @realDonaldTrump- tell your Kebbler elf to back off! Taking life-saving medicine away from kids is HEARTLESS!
949607280474914816 2018-01-06 11:43:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @EricTrump @DineshDSouza "Many" people didn't have daddy Trump give them $1,000,000 start-up money earned while being a slum lord. If DJT had started with $1, I'd give him some credit. He lies and won't release his tax returns. Foreign banks are the only ones who will loan him money. Nyet?
949410459303665664 2018-01-05 22:41:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> There you go, @SteveSchmidtSES, forcing me to share your words on Facebook again for friends who aren't on Twitter. They are CA liberals to ND conservatives and realize we're all in this mess together. Preach it, Steve!
949302293127610368 2018-01-05 15:31:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh, Jr. You need to man up and admit your role in the Trump Tower meeting with those Russian "adoption" lawyers and the cover-up that followed. Nixon didn't break into the Watergate. He covered up the crime and obstructed justice. I'm wide awake & don't baaaa like a sheep. Meow!
949292049462738945 2018-01-05 14:50:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Please provide link that says that collusion has been proven to be a hoax. STOP THE LIES! The Russians meddled in our election on YOUR BEHALF. Stop undermining my country's law enforcement and intelligence agencies. You are the most unfit POTUS who shames us daily!

949288016081600512 2018-01-05 14:34:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RandiACaras Aren't there tapes? I think we should all insist that the tapes be released so @realDonaldTrump can dispute them word for word. Talk about an "awkward" next staff meeting. LOL
949277683363471361 2018-01-05 13:53:31 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @BillKristol @SteveSchmidtSES We are in unprecedented times when a look at this progressive's Facebook feed shows me sharing words of wisdom from both of you. We can agree to disagree on approach and specifics on policy; but we must stand united against the attack on our country. TY both!
949274828606922757 2018-01-05 13:42:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr How fun is it when the rats start turning on each other? While everyone waits in line to buy the book, Mueller just keeps plodding away. Jared, Ivanka and you all have some explaining to do! Your daddy and the "I don't recall" Keebler elf too! 2018 is gonna rock!
949273294603108353 2018-01-05 13:36:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CharlesMBlow It irks my spirit too! @PressSec is "supposedly" a Christian. She must not be Catholic like me or she'd still be in the confessional if she was! I've asked Sarah more than once WWJD; but her response is always a lie. Sarah is part of the moral rot that has infested this WH.
949267577653506048 2018-01-05 13:13:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Did you hear that the pot shop owner was elected to city council in my Red Zone? You won my county with almost 60% in 2016. Millennials came out in force in 2017 to elect the pot guy. Sessions' move just gave those same voters incentive to come out this year. 2018 is gonna rock!
949266061509013504 2018-01-05 13:07:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @hillhulse @nytimes My city in the Red Zone just elected the pot shop owner to city council in Nov. His win was driven by millennials who voted in the off year election. Trump & Sessions just gave those same millennials incentive to vote in mid-terms. Smart, guys, really smart!! 2018 is gonna rock!
949264866740613121 2018-01-05 13:02:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @washingtonpost "I do not recall" says our Attorney General when asked repeatedly about the Russia probe. I don't want him fired. I want Sessions to go down with the rest of the rotten eggs in this administration. Mueller Time!
949244516019535872 2018-01-05 11:41:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump A reminder that 18 states are raising their minimum wage. Don't try to take credit for those wage increases. You did nothing to raise those workers pay. Tell your bean counters so they don't include these 18 states in your wage tally. You did NOTHING to earn credit.
949235662682652673 2018-01-05 11:06:32 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump He says there are tapes. Tapes of your WH staff talking candidly about everything from your toddler tantrums to your intelligence level. I think in fairness to you, all tapes should be made public. Nyet, comrade?
949021332599009280 2018-01-04 20:54:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec @MeetThePress LOL, Sarah!! How many lies has your boss told and then you repeat? This is nothing more than an attack on free speech with the main goal to stop publication of the dirt on this unfit POTUS. Lie, Lie, Lie!! Don't preach to us, Sarah, while failing to answer WWJD.
948946114383724549 2018-01-04 15:55:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Red & Blue pot states are ready to rumble and come to the battle locked and "loaded" with local and state tax revenue. My Red Zone just elected a pot shop owner to City Council in Nov. Millennials came out in force. Not smartest political move to poke that nest!
948934113897062400 2018-01-04 15:08:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DavidCornDC Yeah, but he'll still continue to blame it on Democrats. My Republican Attorney General directed his commission to their website and the publicly-available information allowed by state law. Sadly, the gullible and uninformed will believe the POTUS voter fraud lie.
948929469451874304 2018-01-04 14:49:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @matthewamiller My city in the reddest Red Zone of WA St just elected a pot shop owner to our City Council. He was elected Mayor Pro Tem. That new demographic (millennials) who turned out for him will not take kindly to Trump admin attempts to undermine state's rights. 2018 is gonna be fun!!
948927527984119808 2018-01-04 14:42:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics My city in the reddest Red Zone of WA St just elected a pot shop owner to our City Council. He was elected Mayor Pro Tem.

948921993167958018 2018-01-04 14:20:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Hiring foreign workers in your resorts who won't question the boss. Knowing which third world countries have few if any labor laws for Trump sweat shops. What's wrong with American workers, Jr.? Trumps don't seem to like hiring them. MAGA, my ass! Zero US economic patriotism.
948905496672591874 2018-01-04 13:14:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump After learning of Russia's hack of the 2016 election, I am even more thankful that my state 1) votes by mail and 2) has a piece of paper for re-counts. I've watched re-counts by county auditors - Ds and Rs - and THERE IS NO VOTER FRAUD! My SofS is also a Republican. Nice try!!
948898981257527296 2018-01-04 12:48:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump My Republican Secretary of State's response to your request: I took an oath of office to uphold the state law and the constitution, Wyman said Saturday. I dont get to pick which laws I follow and which ones I dont. Your attempt to blame Dems is another swing & a miss!
948896731801968640 2018-01-04 12:39:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Back to going after black athletes again? With every tweet, you show how UNFIT you are to be POTUS! Ask Papa (John, not the coffee boy) what happens to people who try to divide Americans. The veterans who gave their lives for us didn't have bone spurs to chicken out of action!
948893358444855296 2018-01-04 12:26:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics My first belly laugh of the morning!! @IvankaTrump as POTUS? Will she still manufacture her crappy shoes and handbags in foreign sweatshops instead of giving those jobs to Americans? No way, Barbie Doll. Just like your dad, you lack the intelligence & moral compass to lead.
948683461505642496 2018-01-03 22:32:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr I think you might be protesting a bit too much, Junior. Didn't he call your meeting in Trump Tower with those "adoption" lawyers treasonous? So many former Trump Campaign officials ready to spill the beans. 2018 is gonna be GREAT!!
948563085148569600 2018-01-03 14:33:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC @jacobsoboroff @SRuhle We just elected a pot shop owner to the city council in my town in the deepest Red Zone of WA State. Within 5 minutes of his swearing in, he was named Mayor pro tem. I would love @SteveKornacki to look at the new demographics on that turnout. I see millennials!!
948561107509067776 2018-01-03 14:26:06 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @POTUS @IvankaTrump Hey! Have you moved the manufacturing of your crappy shoes & handbags to the U.S. yet? Apparently you like taking advantage of the relaxed labor standards in China and elsewhere in the sweatshops that make your products. Don't preach to us, Hypocrite Barbie!!
948549825917722624 2018-01-03 13:41:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL...WikiLeaks...better known as the Trump Campaign's version of the Watergate burglars. 16 unhinged tweets on 1/2? Inquiring minds around the world want to know if the upcoming annual physical includes a psychological evaluation. You may be used to the cra-cra, but we're not.
948181571269402625 2018-01-02 13:17:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @BillKristol Will the upcoming annual physical of this national embarrassment include a psychological evaluation? This tweet should concern all Americans. He is unhinged and dangerous! Ugh, is right!
947923610542358528 2018-01-01 20:12:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump Don't you dare include these wage increases in your tally for 2018. You did nothing to help these workers! Real people in these 18 states worked their butts off to make sure all boats rise. You gave us trickle down!!
947847818084880384 2018-01-01 15:11:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You are the most inappropriate POTUS in the history of my country! Not one ounce of class or dignity the office requires. I predict we'll have us some Mueller Time in 2018. Champagne corks popping all over the world when Russian assets are outed! Nyet, comrade?
947846251025797122 2018-01-01 15:05:31 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Just curious how big the bill will be that you send to the taxpayers for your golf vacation at your own resort...again. Confirming how to make out the check: Pay to the order of Trump Organization? Does that include tips to the workers as well or do you get a % of that too? $$$$$
947464931556737025 2017-12-31 13:50:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I don't have a single stock to my name. Your message misses the mark to the vast majority of Americans. Oh, and did you hear that women are going to be marching again in January? Get your crowd counters ready because it's going to be HUGE! Meow.
947463340443410432 2017-12-31 13:43:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump "People" who are RICH are better off...the rest of us not so much. Women are running and winning all over the country - even in the Red Zone where I live. Millennials can't stand you and came out in droves this year. 2018 is going to be a tsunami! LOL
947460075441987584 2017-12-31 13:30:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Did you read this @realDonaldTrump? Who is again on wrong side of the Rule of Law? I said at the beginning of this shit show that we would grow to love the legal eagles who would save us from a dictator-wanna be. My AG Ferguson is quite a fan of saying to you "See you in court."
947453574249771009 2017-12-31 13:05:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TheRickyDavila @marcorubio You break it, you buy it! If you run for POTUS, your votes will be your undoing. We will not forget for one minute that you blinked and voted to give away the store to your corporate donors. My 5 year old autistic nephew on CHIP asks you "What about me?" WWJD?
947098116884283392 2017-12-30 13:32:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @BillKristol I find it fascinating that Trump fails to see his own hypocrisy in his taunt of Iran. Isn't he the one who called NFL players taking a knee "sons of bitches" and then called for them to be fired? Perhaps Papa John Schnatter could speak to the real consequences when words offend?
946772058104414208 2017-12-29 15:57:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @JoyAnnReid @waltshaub How sad he's not taken his 11 months in office to educate himself. It shows daily in his tweets. I cringe most of the time..yesterday's climate change tweet was delicious in its ignorance. Why do I feel like I have to constantly apologize to the world for what we've become?
946755453953851392 2017-12-29 14:51:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill We expect @realDonaldTrump to help states prepare for 2018 when he refuses to acknowledge that Russians hacked our election? Nothing like putting self before country. Thank God my state has paper mail ballots that the Russians can't corrupt. Nyet, comrade?
946754124460068864 2017-12-29 14:45:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thedailybeast @SRuhle @AliVelshi You have become two of my favorites for your knowledge about everything financial. If only the POTUS would watch your show instead of watching Faux & Friends. He might learn something! Give me the facts & the numbers. They don't lie.
946752686426222592 2017-12-29 14:40:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CillizzaCNN Wouldn't logic dictate that the man who plays more golf than President Obama ever did would be in better shape than him? Perhaps those two Big Macs, two filet of fish and a milk shake lunches counter the "exercise". Tubby Tyrant.
946733811676491776 2017-12-29 13:25:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I thought you told Americans that Mexico was going to pay for your wall. You said it...it must be true. Wait...you said it, so it's likely not true. Setting records for lies during first year!! I'm not paying for your stinking wall either! Hurry up, Mueller!!!
946732303941754880 2017-12-29 13:19:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump So, are you now advocating to privatize our postal services? Some rich friend of yours want that piece of the action? Haven't you enriched your rich friends enough? Don't you need to bill the American people for yet more Trump property stays? Con, con, con!!!
946730475262918656 2017-12-29 13:11:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CBSNews No, @realDonaldTrump, you can't do whatever you want. Dictators think like that. Strongmen think like that. Your thug BFF Putin thinks like that. The United States has separation of powers and the Rule of Law for a reason. Our founding fathers foresaw a future Trump!!
946727360929210368 2017-12-29 12:59:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You just keep believing Faux & Friends and stay as ignorant as your tweet yesterday on climate change. If you don't understand the difference between climate & weather, it is clear you watch the faux network and believe everything it spews. 32% is your size! LOL
946559978978009088 2017-12-28 01:54:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics Doh!
946558718346268672 2017-12-28 01:49:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Wow. That tweet just had me cringing, once again, on behalf of sane Americans. Thank God for that hunky Macron putting US climate scientists to work. Have you hugged a polar bear lately? Google it! Your banned words make us the laughing stock of the world!
946380185183518720 2017-12-28 13:59:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @RepRooney Frustrated? Try being an American watching their elected officials try to undermine our institutions and the Rule of Law. You should be ashamed, not frustrated! Sit down. Shut Up. Let Mueller do his job or you too are complicit in Obstruction of Justice.
946374660635074561 2017-12-28 13:37:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump It's just another way for the rich to get richer. Undoing Obama's legacy via EOs shows just how much your ego can't stand it. And, hey, didn't Obama just get named Gallop's Most Admired Man IN THE WORLD for the 10th time? Try to EO that one!! LOL
946368579468849152 2017-12-28 13:13:46 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TIME I wouldn't buy @IvankaTrump foreign-made crap if it cost $1. I guess some Americans don't mind Trump family lack of economic patriotism and don't care about those MADE IN CHINA labels. MAGA, my ass!
946363114907303937 2017-12-28 12:52:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @SenatorCollins can redeem her reputation by delivering on these health care bills. My 5 year old autistic nephew NEEDS his CHIP. Work with Democrats to fix things. We know the GOP doesn't give a crap about my nephew; but I'm hoping you are the exception, Senator.
946355581593333760 2017-12-28 12:22:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TODAYshow At least Bush & Obama didn't send the American people the bill that said "Pay to the order of ME" like @realDonaldTrump does. I don't mind them taking a break; but I DO MIND that the current POTUS gets the money!
946346216895287296 2017-12-28 11:44:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TrumpGolfLA @EricTrump Are you sending the American people a bill for your stay? How tired are we of paying for the lavish lifestyle of the conman and his family? Your sisters blowing kisses at us was the height of rich people flaunting their excess...especially since we're paying for it. MAGA, my ass!
946344267391188992 2017-12-28 11:37:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump It's too bad you had to lie again in front of these heroes!! You have NOT signed more bills than any POTUS in history!!! Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie!! Will you then make poor @PressSec lie too? America was already great before you arrived with your constant lies.
946335488968835072 2017-12-28 11:02:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @WSJ @MooreSenate You lost...get over it and move along. Alabama had the smarts and morals to reject you. Go take some horse riding lessons because you don't even know how to ride that poor horse!!
946156521108291585 2017-12-27 23:11:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoyAnnReid Only if there is 1) no privatization of our infrastructure, 2) no weakening of prevailing wage laws (Republicans should educate themselves on who it was that championed Davis Bacon and WHY and 3) no weakening of worker safety regulations.
946153981960585216 2017-12-27 23:01:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @jamiejmcintyre @realDonaldTrump I see you are off the greens and back on the self-congratulatory wagon again. My 5 year old autistic nephew still doesn't have his CHIP; but the Trump property stays for 1/3 of your 2017 speak volumes as to where YOU want the money to go. PaytotheorderofTrump.
946035175221215232 2017-12-27 15:08:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @allinwithchris @NaveedAJamali Thanks for the spot on analysis! Between you and @MalcolmNance, you give Americans the experienced view into the Russian spy world. And, how cool that you're in Seattle! I'm resisting from the Red Zone of WA in Jim Mattis' hometown of Tri-Cities. Keep up the great work!!
946030732555599877 2017-12-27 14:51:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @morningmika I resist on behalf of my 4 year old granddaughter and my suffragist grandmother and her future proper bridge club ladies shown in my profile picture smoking and playing women's cards. I come from feisty women who have always spoken truth to power. I too am blessed!
946004326517899270 2017-12-27 13:06:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RichardLui @MSNBC @RepRooney I think it's time to "purge" Republicans who have become complicit in their attempt to stop the investigation of Trump and Russia. History will record your words. After Mueller has issued his report, you will look like the fool you are. Time to purge GOP/Russia comrades! Nyet?
945999886964613121 2017-12-27 12:48:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee Thanks for the belly laugh!! Now your daughter will repeat it over and over and over and over and over and over and presto chango, it will become true and real to your ignorant sheep who likely don't even know who Churchill was. LOL. LOL. LOL.
945681166861926401 2017-12-26 15:42:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @NFIB @IvankaTrump So, will your tax savings be put to use bringing your manufacturing to the shores of the USA so you can show some economic patriotism? Until then, you have nothing of interest I want to hear. I like my products labeled MADE IN USA! Get it?
945662059705909250 2017-12-26 14:26:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @BillKristol Amen, Bill. I can deal with devil I recognize; but not the one neo-Puritans have crowned. I am part of the Christian left and a feminist, resisting on behalf of my suffragist grandmother of my profile picture smoking & playing women's cards. Happy to resist with you!
945657502909194240 2017-12-26 14:08:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill A daily embarrassment that just keeps on giving!! @realDonaldTrump should spend less time tweeting and golfing and use that time educating himself on the world by reading every word of his daily briefings & asking questions if he doesn't understand. Because he clearly doesn't.
945648263796887552 2017-12-26 13:31:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfrlends @realDonaldTrump LOL...you trust Faux News over your own intelligence agencies. Your attempt to undermine our FBI to obstruct justice YET AGAIN will be duly noted in the logs of history. Did you hear your BFF Putin blocked his opponent from running? Putin envy, comrade?
945633850868219905 2017-12-26 12:34:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @WSJ @PressSec Rich people like your boss don't care about real people. If they did, they would re-authorize CHIP so my 5 year old autistic nephew would continue getting the care he needs. More than 100 days at a Trump property, sending the bill to those lower & middle Americans. MAGA, my ass!!
945630306802941953 2017-12-26 12:20:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump More than 100 days at one of your Trump properties and you send the bill to taxpayers? That's not making anything great but Trump's bottom $$ line. MAGA = Mueller Ain't Going Away! HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!
945629183203409921 2017-12-26 12:15:40 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Why hasn't it happened yet? You promised everyone health care; but the GOP still hasn't even renewed CHIP. My 5 year old autistic nephew needs CHIP; but you and your rich donors need the money more? Republicans never take care of real people...just rich people.
945337222844133376 2017-12-25 16:55:32 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RSherman_25 This is one 12 who will always be there through the adversity and the injuries. We are all given the right to free speech and I will stand or kneel with those of you who use your platform to impact change. Papa John got smacked and sacked. Thanks for always keeping it real, #25!
945315057780506624 2017-12-25 15:27:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SenBobCorker Now that you got your nice golden parachute, how about showing compassion for the kids on CHIP? My 5-year old autistic nephew, who is still in diapers, needs his CHIP. His doc says he's likely a savant; but let's just throw him away so rich people can get even more $$. GOP sucks!
944934404157145088 2017-12-24 14:14:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Is @realDonaldTrump listening? Likely not. His firing of Comey set this whole obstruction of justice in motion to try to cut off investigation of his campaign's crimes with Russia. These attacks on FBI are disgusting and un-American; but Russians are loving it. Nyet, comrade?
944930546429202433 2017-12-24 13:59:32 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How the world laughs at the current POTUS. Your personality disorder requires it to be about you and ONLY YOU. We are so sick of you embarrassing us on the world stage with your badass 32% approval. Two out of three Americans don't think you're so hot!! MAGA, my ass!!!
944927453599821824 2017-12-24 13:47:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You are disgusting in your quest to con the American people into believing you did nothing wrong. Attacking our institutions. Attacking the Rule of Law. Even if you fire McCabe, nothing changes. You will still have obstructed justice too many times to count & colluded. Nyet?
944926176341934080 2017-12-24 13:42:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Still trying to undermine our country's law enforcement? Even on Christmas Eve? You won't fire Mueller, but you'll fire McCabe? News Flash: THAT DOESN'T STOP A DAMN THING!! So, what exactly are you trying to cover up? Russians + Trump = Collusion! Happy Holidays!
944570527645032448 2017-12-23 14:08:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @tribelaw @RWPUSA So, can one have multiple counts of Obstruction of Justice? I'm counting on those in the FBI who are in the crosshairs of this evil man to have been keeping their own contemporaneous notes.
944568327162044416 2017-12-23 14:00:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoyAnnReid I love my library! It is always full of people - young and old - at computer stations throughout the building. It always reminds me how "privileged" I am to have it all at my disposal on my computer and my phone. Feel disconnected? Libraries are the heartbeat of my community!
944558934114758656 2017-12-23 13:22:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @larry_kudlow @PressSec During Obama years between 2009 and 2016, GDP growth reached at or above 3% on a quarterly basis about eight times. Why do you continue to lie about Obama? Why do you try to destroy this honorable man? Fake Christians like you are what makes this insult even worse! WWJD, Sarah?
944557689450799110 2017-12-23 13:17:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @EricTrump Trumps can try to distract, deflect and deny that you weren't playing footsie with the Russians; but Mueller isn't distracted. His investigation is getting a little too close to home with at least three family in the spotlight. Don't confuse the clear-thinking with your sheep.
944556197159383041 2017-12-23 13:12:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec Instead of giving tax breaks to the filthy rich like 'you know who', how about re-authorizing CHIP so my 5 year-old autistic nephew can get the help he needs. That's not "liberal", it's called Christian compassion...something lacking in today's White House. Faux Christians!!
944534036910764032 2017-12-23 11:43:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump If @IvankaTrump is so worried about the average American, she could move the manufacturing of her shitty shoes & handbags to the USA & give them jobs. What...Americans won't work in sweat shops? MAGA, my ass!
944533234083184641 2017-12-23 11:40:46 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump 9 million Americans just signed up - even though you wouldn't advertise open enrollment - social media handled it. You would want them all to go without health care because you hate the POTUS it is named after? You are the worst POTUS in history of USA! MAGA, my ass!
944206249578479616 2017-12-22 14:01:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC @PhilipRucker @morningmoneyben @bobtorricelli @SRuhle "Boeing announced that it would spend $300 million on employee-related and charitable investments because of the tax plan." Those don't sound like bonuses to me. Boeing also got an $8.7 BILLION tax break from WA St and took away their workers' "pensions". Give me a break!
944201411562053632 2017-12-22 13:42:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @politico You break it. You buy it, Mitch!!
944200705694253059 2017-12-22 13:39:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @washingtonpost @BlakeFarenthold should think seriously about leaving Congress early. The longer it goes on, the more the people of his district are embarrassed by their rep.
944195929128648704 2017-12-22 13:20:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Don't try to privatize our infrastructure! Your plan needs actual projects, budgets, transparent bidding processes and protections for workers. There will be no bi-partisan infrastructure deal if you try to gift it to your corporate donors! They got enough $$ in your tax bill!!
944190911218565121 2017-12-22 13:00:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Nyet! Nyet! Nyet! She's a monster's mouthpiece and nothing more. She embarrassed our nation with her rhetoric threatening allied nations who didn't get in lock step with this monster. Well, at least they used to be our allies. @nikkihaley don't start measuring for drapes!

I have never been ashamed to be an American until this bozo came along!

943858915225120768 2017-12-21 15:01:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Excuse me; but don't Republicans CONTROL both the House and the Senate? Weren't you the guy heaped with praise yesterday for being THIS GREAT LEADER? So, LEAD those majority Republicans to pass it! At least you can't blame it on Obama these days, nyet?
943855670159216646 2017-12-21 14:48:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @Toure @CREWcrew You mean @realDonaldTrump? Claim: Says the tax bill "is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me." I can't believe that he lied....wait...yes I can. The whole Trump family is all about the money. Never about us.
943851341998301184 2017-12-21 14:31:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @morningmika @SenBobCorker @Morning_Joe @Room007ac Why do Republicans always want to play "whataboutism"? This could go on and on; but I'm not in a mood to play with you. Should the GOP-controlled Congress & the GOP POTUS not renew CHIP, it is TOTALLY ON THEM!
943847916543787008 2017-12-21 14:17:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @morningmika @SenBobCorker @Morning_Joe @Room007ac Color me skeptical after the bait and switch McConnell just pulled on her! Dems won't be shutting the government down. Republicans control Congress and the WH; but sure you can "try" to lay the messaging groundwork to blame Democrats. MAGA, my ass! Eyes wide open here!!
943844023382433793 2017-12-21 14:02:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @morningmika @SenBobCorker @Morning_Joe @Room007ac As much as I search for it just now, the headline announcing CHIP renewal isn't there. Who is leading the charge to fund it? I do pay attention...I work in politics! I have 5 sitting state supreme court justices on my client list; so I'm far from an idiot!
943838353803243526 2017-12-21 13:39:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SenBobCorker @Morning_Joe Ask him about CHIP!!! @morningmika My 5 year old autistic nephew depends on it.
943835320704831488 2017-12-21 13:27:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @IvankaTrump Are you going to announce that you're moving the manufacturing of your sweat shop shoes and handbags to the US to put AMERICANS to work? Or, are you going to take the sweet tax deal to reap $$$ while maintaining your China sweatshops? MAGA, my ass, Barbie Doll!
943829679521153024 2017-12-21 13:05:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @louisjnelson @politico I've never understood how seriously rich people can play the "victim" so well. @DonaldJTrumpJr your whining is adorable! The only undermining going on is the one where you and others are trying to undermine Mueller. Perhaps he has the goods on you too, Jr.!!!!!
943828046863220737 2017-12-21 12:58:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Is that the same Faux News that has been leading the pack on sexual harassment pay-offs? The same Faux News that plays up your insane conspiracy theories? The same Faux News where women are put on display in short dresses to show off tons of legs for you misogynists? Success!
943825658727186432 2017-12-21 12:49:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I lost every bit of respect I had for @SenatorCollins. The decadence of giving rich people HUGE tax breaks while trying to destory Obamacare is how @SenateMajLdr governs. My 5 year old autistic nephew is about to lose his CHIP and @SenatorCollins doesn't give a crap. Shame!!!!
943824646691893250 2017-12-21 12:45:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Dems voted against the tax bill that will give you and your family MILLIONS in tax relief. Dems want you to fund CHIP so kids like my 5 year old autistic nephew get the help they need. But, as long as the rich get richer, kids will get pushed off the bus. Hurry up Mueller!!!
943489915680989184 2017-12-20 14:34:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Yep...but your donor class WILL open their checkbooks for 2018 if you deliver them massive tax breaks. @SpeakerRyan Hey, I know you've been busy helping rich pigs line up at the trough; but did you see the Virginia legislature results? That's what your 2018 will look like!!!
943488123094286336 2017-12-20 14:27:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I have spent over 40 years working for workers and have seen my share of hucksters; but @SpeakerRyan takes the cake. This is all about the threat of withholding campaign dollars from the donor class if they are not successful. Give workers some credit for seeing the con!!
943484151671308288 2017-12-20 14:12:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan Such a load of crap! The GOP has done the classic overreach by overtly paying off its donor class so they will in turn open checkbooks for donor dollars. It will be fun watching GOP leadership like @cathymcmorris go down. Former Dem Sen Maj Leader Lisa Brown will take her down!!!
943469204891607043 2017-12-20 13:12:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @tribelaw I live in the Red Zone of Eastern WA. House leader @cathymcmorris is being challenged by the former Democratic WA St Senate Majority Leader who knows how to raise money and campaign. McMoRo is going down next year!!
943465056502652928 2017-12-20 12:56:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Let's touch base a year from now and see how the House majority has changed. @cathymcmorris is being challenged by the former Dem Senate Majority Leader who is going to take back Tom Foley's old seat. Prepare to retire McMoRo!!!
943464102327963649 2017-12-20 12:52:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill THIS made my morning!! But, don't tell @realDonaldTrump...he might come unraveled and declare war on Hawaii. Love, Love, Love this!!!
943463418610065408 2017-12-20 12:49:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nytimes @SpeakerRyan doesn't care that my 5 year old autistic nephew will lose his CHIP. My representative @RepNewhouse doesn't care that a constituent who is likely a savant is still wearing diapers and will be kicked under the bus. I will work my heart out to defeat Newhouse in '18!!!!
943310998844272643 2017-12-19 02:44:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics No, Junior, we don't want our POTUS and those he has surrounded himself with to be Russian assets. @DonaldJTrumpJr lame attempt to undermine patriotic Americans. Speaking of which, have the Trumps moved their manufacturing to the USA - ZERO economic patriotism!!
943267585319059456 2017-12-19 23:51:32 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @DonaldJTrumpJr is such a class act. It always astounds me as someone who grew up in government mobile home parks all over the country wherever the government sent my fed dad, that it's the rich kids who act like trailer trash. Sad that Palin & Nugent couldn't make the shot.
943238489998483456 2017-12-19 21:55:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @tedlieu @DonaldJTrumpJr @PressSec I want to know why my 5 year old autistic nephew is losing his CHIP to pay for the Trump family tax breaks. No worries that he's a 5 year old savant still in diapers as long as @IvankaTrump gets a tax break for her Made in China crap shoes! Shame on you!
943235896429522944 2017-12-19 21:45:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Still manufacturing your cheap shoes and handbags in foreign sweatshops? Rich people who offshore jobs celebrate their tax $$ while my 5 year old autistic nephew loses his CHIP to pay for it. Trump family laughs all the way to Deutsche Bank!! Nyet?
943131113668583424 2017-12-19 14:49:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PostOpinions @washingtonpost The whole thing shows how broken the GOP is. @SenBobCorker doesn't care if my 5 year old autistic nephew who is still in diapers will be losing his CHIP in order to save money to give Corker a nice golden parachute. They will leave kids like my nephew hanging in the wind. Shame!!
943122463096954880 2017-12-19 14:14:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> The irony that the Russians didn't have a court order to hack her emails, but Mueller had cooperation from account holder(s) and/or criminal courts issuing search warrants for his.   Irony is rich; but Karma is the bitch! Meow! @realDonaldTrumppic.twitter.com/Ni8mDWFlx7
943109296438460416 2017-12-19 13:22:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @jaketapper @JenniferJJacobs And, the train was going 80 mph in a 30 mph zone on a new line that was opposed by local government because of safety concerns. @realDonaldTrump got it wrong again! He also failed the POTUS empathy test by ignoring my fellow WA residents killed & injured until criticized. Failed!
943099143928422401 2017-12-19 12:42:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @jaketapper @mkraju Wait for @realDonaldTrump to tell us that he has the best approval rating in the history of the country. And, sadly, his sheep will believe every word out of his lying mouth once @PressSec repeats the lie over and over and over. #NeverMyPOTUS
943091796321509376 2017-12-19 12:13:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @kylegriffin1 They simply don't care. I have a 5 year old autistic nephew who is about to lose his CHIP. He's likely a savant, his doctors say, but still wears diapers. Let's just throw these kids away in the name of obscene tax breaks for the rich. MAGA, my ass!!!!
943084469510008833 2017-12-19 11:43:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill And @realDonaldTrump laps it up, thinking "Wow...Vlad really likes me". He also bans words and attacks journalists just like his BFF. We have our own strong man in the White House who is currently attacking the Rule of Law. Wake up, America!
942902947612000256 2017-12-18 23:42:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Shameful attempt to undermine the Special Counsel and the Rule of Law. Read the language of their response: "We have secured either the account owners consent or appropriate criminal process". Appropriate. Criminal. Process. "Account owner's consent" = flipped! Get it now, Jr.?
942846856597344256 2017-12-18 19:59:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @IvankaTrump @foxandfriends Did she announce that she was bringing her manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.? Didn't think so. She has nothing of interest to say to us until she does. ZERO economic patriotism from the billionaire's daughter. Go figure!
942841889522249728 2017-12-18 19:39:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Third time must be the charm, POTUS. You clearly lack the empathy required to lead this country. It was only when your 1st tweet landed with a thud and you were criticized for NOT EVEN mentioning my Washingtonians killed and injured that you had to add on. Unacceptable!!!!
942835435041988608 2017-12-18 19:14:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Your first thoughts were not of my fellow Washingtonians who are dead or hurt; but of promoting your own agenda. This second tweet tells us where your priorities lie and that you have a LONG WAY TO GO before understanding the empathy required to be POTUS. Shame on you!
942733897015500801 2017-12-18 12:30:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @Uncle_Jimbo So, by manufacturing their cheap crap in foreign sweat shops, the Trumps are putting America First? It's all about the money and nothing else. If I'm wrong, Donald Trump should release his tax returns and prove me wrong. Or, I can wait for Mueller!!
942731376511524864 2017-12-18 12:20:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @tribelaw Thank God for millennials! They will be the ones who save my country from the evils of Trump's bigotry!!
942730719159238656 2017-12-18 12:18:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Color me shocked that Liddle @SenBobCorker would be a sell out! When it comes to feathering one's own nest, Bob nails it. Too harsh, Senator? My 5 year old autistic nephew is about to lose his CHIP and the future savant will stay in diapers. Feel good about that, Bobby?
942725725999677440 2017-12-18 11:58:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Will she be wearing her foreign-made, sweat shop stilettos with matching handbag? You know, the ones she'll now get a big tax break from as a reward for her ZERO ECONOMIC PATRIOTISM to my country's workers. Why does she continue to manufacture on foreign soil? MAGA, my ass.
942724416894525440 2017-12-18 11:53:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Once the American people read your tax plan, they will abandon you. I read the plan's changes for people like the Trumps who manufacture their goods overseas. @IvankaTrump must be jumping for joy in those foreign sweat shop stilettos, nyet? Zero economic patriotism, those Trumps!
942412876408438784 2017-12-17 15:15:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Watching @amjoyshow, listening to @MalcolmNance and @NaveedAJamali talking about Trump and Authoritarianism. Love their insight into the warning signs we've seen since the beginning; but it also scares me to my American core.
942403863813820416 2017-12-17 14:39:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Amen.https://twitter.com/ananavarro/status/942393685517455360
942386594375278594 2017-12-17 13:30:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DrDarrinPorcher @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews Don't you dare question my patriotism when the Trump family shows ZERO economic patriotism by continuing to manufacture their cheap crap overseas. I root for people & companies who put country before profit. Why are Trumps unable to do that? $$$$$$$$
942374380452986881 2017-12-17 12:42:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Thank God there are entrepreneurs who show patriotism for their country by manufacturing their goods in the US. The same can't be said for your products, @IvankaTrump . Made in China sweat shops with labor problems? MAGA, my ass, Barbie Doll. Zero Economic Patriotism!!! Nyet?https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/942171573108314112
942025217773248512 2017-12-16 13:34:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill You mean the documents that @realDonaldTrump never reads? Thank God for that hunky Macron guy putting US climate scientists to work trying to save the planet. Trump embraces coal and is trying to undermine coal miner safety in the name of regulations. What a (con)trast!
942021356996083713 2017-12-16 13:19:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @BillKristol I respect your anti-Trump stand, but you couldn't be more wrong about this progressive. My profile picture is of my grandmother and her suffragist friends playing "women's cards" 100 years ago. I resist for them and for my 4 year old granddaughter. Not hostile - committed.
942017676737593344 2017-12-16 13:04:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @MooreSenate You lost. Jones won. The people of Alabama refused to be stained by your election. Evangelical Christians have done great damage to their brand by condoning racism & sexual deviants. My favorite election night comment: F**k you and the horse you rode in on! Go away!
942010244120559617 2017-12-16 12:35:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> I take back every kind word I've said about @SenBobCorker. Isn't it wonderful that my 5 year old autistic nephew, who is still in pull-ups, will soon lose his CHIP and Liddle Bob Corker will get a nice tax shelter with that money? Sell out! Hypocrite! Heartless GOP!!!https://twitter.com/tribelaw/status/942005979301974016
942000624454877184 2017-12-16 11:57:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> I guess we should be thankful that @IvankaTrump didn't open a store inside the White House. Hey shoppers...look for the Made in USA label. No, I'm serious. Look to see how much economic patriotism the Trumps have. You've been conned!https://twitter.com/thehill/status/941897199390257152
941394855124758528 2017-12-14 19:49:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MalcolmNance @MotherJones There goes that WA State Attorney General Bob Ferguson!! You remember the one who has told Trump "See you in court" multiple times already? We love that our AG is willing to keep suing on behalf of the Rule of Law. He's our Superman! Go get 'em, Bob!
941349546604531712 2017-12-14 16:49:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan @thehill I will once again ask my question, Speaker Ryan. Why is he still there instead of being shown the door like the rest of them? How much clearer do the American people need to be that we don't want SEXUAL ABUSERS in our government...be it Roy Moore or Farenthold?
941296970227884032 2017-12-14 13:21:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr How much do I detest you all using Hitler's playbook to discredit the press and our institutions? Will your daddy fire Mueller to Obstruct Justice - again! Your own complicity is showing, Junior. Your privileged arrogance will be fun to see taken down.
941293627522801665 2017-12-14 13:07:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Yay...say the rich people with money in the Stock Market. Still haven't answered my question, POTUS, why Trumps still continue to manufacture their "crap" in sweatshops in China. Zero economic patriotism, those Trumps. But, you'll get a whopper tax break. So wrong!
941288217851994112 2017-12-14 12:46:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Having lost a child, I know there is nothing more painful. I watched George Straight's "I Believe" tribute to Sandy Hook victims like I do each 12/14 and feeling incredibly sad that our country is more in love with its guns than its children.https://twitter.com/NicolleDWallace/status/941284414121791488
941285748979855360 2017-12-14 12:36:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Not surprising! @realDonaldTrump has always felt his privilege entitled him to go after anything his liddle heart desired. Congress needs to do a thorough investigation of HIM, not Bob Mueller. Obstruct much, POTUS?
941280784085684224 2017-12-14 12:16:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @EricTrump - you are just as disgusting as your father. I almost feel sorry for the women in the Trump family being surrounded by such toxic men. Your daddy's day of reckoning is near. Buckle up!!!https://twitter.com/thehill/status/941279381170917379
941278315003895808 2017-12-14 12:06:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MonmouthPoll @Morning_Joe Wow @realDonaldTrump...I'm shocked that you're not screaming these numbers from the rafters. 32% - man that is impressive. That means two out of three Americans think you're full of it! Nyet?
941277673476653056 2017-12-14 12:04:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @RoyMooreSenator You lost!! Alabama has rejected you again. Twice removed from the bench. They don't want you to represent them. Go figure!! Go away!!
941270510599487490 2017-12-14 11:35:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Why is he still there @SpeakerRyan?
941263197935353856 2017-12-14 11:06:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> It just goes to show that when people want to send a strong message to the sexual deviants of AL and the WH, they go vote. Thankful that AL decided to send a prosecutor to Washington...one who prosecuted KKK for killing kids. See the connection yet, genius?https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/941147061185122305

940917589789650944 2017-12-13 12:13:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump There was no deck stacked against him. Roy Moore lost because people believed that he was a pedophile who preyed on young girls. Even more fun is that 70% of Americans think Congress should investigate sexual allegations against YOU!! Bring it!
940796886222561280 2017-12-12 04:13:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump The people of Alabama showed their integrity by rejecting you, Roy Moore and Steve Bannon. The numbers tell the story. Tip of the hat to moral Republicans who led the charge against you all!!!

940725561596329984 2017-12-12 23:30:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @washingtonpost She has nothing to offer this strong woman who raised two boys with zero child support or any other support. She was handed life on a silver platter and is complicit in being one of her daddy's enablers. @IvankaTrump doesn't speak for me or any other strong women I know!
940682885031370752 2017-12-12 20:40:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> At least you gave her the chance, @morningmika. As a Christian, I am sickened by her continuing to stand with an immoral POTUS. OMG...my mind isn't in the gutter for reading it that way @PressSec . MOST SANE MORAL PEOPLE read it that way! Sick!!!
940681520083173376 2017-12-12 20:35:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec There is a special place in hell for women who are the mouthpiece for an accused sexual abuser. Your brand of evangelical Christian makes me ill. WWJD? From a member of the moral Christian left.
940604719373828096 2017-12-12 15:30:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How fun watching @Morning_Joe live from Alabama and having your tweet against Senator Gillibrand read to those in the studio audience. Listening to Republican women on the panel & audience react to your words was priceless. Reject Moore!!!
940603828503699456 2017-12-12 15:26:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Just curious, Junior, have the Trump products carrying the MADE IN CHINA label been moved back to shores of the USA? If not, then please stop trying to con the American people. ZERO ECONOMIC PATRIOTISM!!!
940592584186933249 2017-12-12 14:42:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Are we trying to distract again, Junior? Did your daddy just disgrace himself with another sexist, misogynistic tweet against a sitting woman Senator? Why does your dad hate women so much? Or, is it just the smart women who have had his number for years? Shameful!

940573360433520641 2017-12-12 13:25:38 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN Keep fighting for kids @jimmykimmel. I have an autistic nephew who is 5 and still wears pull-ups. Without his CHIP, he will never get the care he needs to develop the rest of his brain. His doctor says he's likely a savant. Keep fighting for kids, Jimmy!!
940569850463657984 2017-12-12 13:11:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump She didn't raise her right hand to swear allegiance to YOU. Gawd...must it always be about you? It's time for another Special Counsel - this one an investigation of your bad acts. Use your own words on tape against you? You and registered sex offender Epstein? YES!!!!
940558760304455680 2017-12-12 12:27:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Buckle up, buttercup, because Mueller ain't done yet! Are you going to make poor @PressSec lie for you again? It is painful to watch Hitler's playbook for the press being used by a POTUS. You dishonor us with every word.
940556616813785089 2017-12-12 12:19:06 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @jaketapper I have an autistic nephew on CHIP. He's 5 & still wears pull-ups. @SpeakerRyan doesn't care that without the health care he needs, he'll likely stay in pull-ups. Shame on you for throwing our kids under the bus so you can give stinking rich people a tax giveaway. Shame!!
940326904040636416 2017-12-11 21:06:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NBCNews @PressSec Yet your boss lies every single day - either words out of his mouth or in his tweets. You people have no room to talk about lies. Your willingness to play along with Hitler's playbook to discredit the press will be duly noted in future history books. Complicit.
940323753753436161 2017-12-11 20:53:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump LOL...the Reality TV king doesn't watch much TV? Your attempts to discredit the press are straight out of Hitler's playbook. Sadly, 32% of the country can't recognize a con when they see one. Hurry up, Mueller!!
940322952356098048 2017-12-11 20:50:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec The height of white privilege is giving the black POTUS zero credit for bringing this country back from the disaster that Wall St created. Perhaps Trump would get some credit if he wasn't always "Look at me. Look at me" Wasn't Obama terrible?" No class in WH at all these days!
940217347490508802 2017-12-11 13:50:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> How much do I love the new leaders of the free world? There's more than one way to work around an ignorant climate science @POTUS.  Macron and Trudeau are the smart, classy leaders we wish we had instead of @realDonaldTrump. They are hunky feminists too!!https://twitter.com/thehill/status/940214866081697792
940200539169595392 2017-12-11 12:44:11 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @LindseyGrahamSC Here is where a Special Counsel is needed. Women in this country have had enough of you men covering for each other. At least the Democrats are cleaning house. GOP, on the other hand, embrace Trump and Roy Moore to get a tax bill passed. 2018 is gonna be fun!
940199267783794688 2017-12-11 12:39:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC So, what administration position did Trump promise to give you? You are a sell-out who apparently has no problem aligning yourself with a serial sexual abuser. How about a Special Counsel to investigate Trump's crimes against women? SELL-OUT!!!
939859234740584448 2017-12-10 14:07:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Just curious if any of those companies coming back into the USA include the name Trump on them. How can you MAGA when you continue to con the American people with your Made in China crap? Bogus!!
939856977206722560 2017-12-10 13:58:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Hey, Junior! Did you get a chance yet to search for that interview with Papa's mama? Manafort, Flynn and Papa...so many secrets in the spy world yet to be revealed. Oh, and Steve Bannon now makes an appearance. Hitler 101: Discredit the Press
939854540571996160 2017-12-10 13:49:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Release your tax returns and show us just how special it will be for you and yours. Just like the gains on Wall Street, it doesn't mean much to people working two jobs at minimum wage. Tell your CEO buddies to raise their workers' wages instead of stashing $$ offshore.
939481133330284544 2017-12-09 13:05:31 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Was it fake news when Papa's mama gave that interview yesterday? She spilled the beans on you all. You can try to distract your sheep; but the rest of us have had your number for a long time. Preach it Papa!!!
939478108737912832 2017-12-09 12:53:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I pray that the smart people across the border in Alabama reject the pedophile you are embracing. I always wondered what kind of women would vote for you. They are women who are complicit by excusing sexual predators. How any mother or grandmother could do that baffles me.
939471459344203776 2017-12-09 12:27:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Both parties should do a clean sweep of those who dishonor not only their position, but the American people paying the hush money. @SpeakerRyan @farenthold should be the next Member of Congress shown the door. I could care less if he paid the $ back. Kick him out!!
939468009206190081 2017-12-09 12:13:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Jeesh @PressSec. No White House First Dog. No White House Correspondent's Dinner. No athletes celebrating championships. No music celebrating Kennedy Center Honors. So what if @realDonaldTrump BFF Putin doesn't get to go. Don't you dare take it away from us!!!
939459583759736833 2017-12-09 11:39:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @washingtonpost @SpeakerRyan This will do more for Democratic victories in 2018 and 2020 than you even realize. You pull the safety net from under Americans and they will make Republicans pay. Even working class Republicans need Medicare & Social Security. Bring it!!!!
939288079755493376 2017-12-08 00:18:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Me thinks you doth protest too much to distract the deplorable from the Russia news of the day, Junior. Papa's mama has been spilling the beans on you guys. I saw it. Did Faux News cover it? Mueller Ain't Going Away...but a few of you are! Nyet?
939094992651292673 2017-12-08 11:31:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You also promised not to touch Medicare & Social Security. Your sheep will keep lapping it up even as they have to move in with their children. You'll tell them to blame Barack Obama - you know, the classy scandal-free POTUS before you? Hurry up, Mueller!!
939090737475416066 2017-12-08 11:14:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics @farenthold I don't care if you pay the money back. I care that you do the right thing and resign! Time for both parties to clean house!!
938962012192759808 2017-12-07 02:42:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @Nationwide @NFL @TMBFoundation @Seahawks @mosesbread72 You make us proud - on and off the field, Michael!!
938896216837914625 2017-12-07 22:21:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @chrislhayes @SteveKornacki Now let's see Farenthold and Barton shown the exit!!
938755800377442304 2017-12-07 13:03:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @washingtonpost Only if Republicans are willing to show the door to their Members of Congress who have behaved deplorably. Let's start with the two from Texas..Barton & Farenthold. Then Roy Moore if he's elected. Step right up, GOP. Grand Old Predators!!
938753033197961216 2017-12-07 12:52:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley I assume then that you will be sending YOUR children and grandchildren to fight World War III? Rich fat cats have seldom sent their own to war. I won't hold my breath that a Trump will ever serve in our military. However, a Trump will be mentioned in history books as starting it!
938746896343896065 2017-12-07 12:27:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I'm sure @realDonaldTrump will make sure his kids @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump and @IvankaTrump are first in line at the recruiting station to sign up for World War III. Unless, of course, bone spurs are hereditary!
938732478528757760 2017-12-07 11:30:38 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr What would a Trump know about moral high ground? You and Jeff Sessions appear to suffer from the same "I can't recall" disease. No one is buying it!
938424259004612609 2017-12-06 15:05:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump MUELLER AIN'T GOING AWAY! Neither are the FBI, the CIA, the NSA nor the other institutions that protect the American people every day and put their lives on the line for us. Secret police? We've seen that before?

938389744651612160 2017-12-06 12:48:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @HuffPost @realDonaldTrump How appropriate that women beat you out for Person of the Year. The Silence Breakers are the purrfect people to win this award. You are next, sir!!
938074611849162753 2017-12-05 15:56:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Okay, let's see some Republicans do the same. We could start with "vile dick pic Joe Barton" or "pay-off my staffer with the People's money Blake Farenthold". I won't hold my breath! Y'all just endorsed pedophile Roy Moore to normalize the behavior & to pass a tax bill. Shame!https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/938068496839249920
938062183509798913 2017-12-05 15:07:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RWPUSA Americans are getting a refresher course (or first-time information for some) about the Hatch Act, the Jones Act, the Logan Act. Should our institutions survive this freak show, I hope Americans will come out of it understanding the Rule of Law.
938058102099738629 2017-12-05 14:50:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Add in the thousands of women who are running next year after "It was just a rally" and 2018 is shaping up to be a Year of the Woman. Even @cathymcmorris is facing a strong challenge from viable former WA St Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown! Tom Foley's old seat is now in play!https://twitter.com/thehill/status/938055376896917506
938052262995181568 2017-12-05 14:27:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Scattered, unraveling and now some "fun" Deutsche Bank records to comb through. And the cherry on top this morning was news that Trump didn't make the 2017 Re-tweeted Tweet list and Obama scored three! Class v Crass. Is that why he's so quiet this morning? LOL LOL LOLhttps://twitter.com/RWPUSA/status/938050030958731265
938048142410268672 2017-12-05 14:11:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill It's likely the only time when Mrs. Pence and I will agree. That said...the stunning difference between the Christian left and the Christian right is that we refused to vote for this "totally vile" man. He also lies like a rug and show his racism daily. WWJD @realDonaldTrump?
938041086831861761 2017-12-05 13:43:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Amazing how many articles I'm reading about Mueller's subpoena for Trump bank records. The smartest people in the room are paying attention to the ruble bread trail crumbs. What are you all hiding from the American people? Curious, nyet?
938036169576607745 2017-12-05 13:23:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @ChuckGrassley Senator - your chracterization of working Americans shows how totally disconnected you are from real people. Some work 2-3 jobs to keep their head above water and you tell them "Let them eat cake." Shame on you!!!
938034705366056962 2017-12-05 13:17:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @jaketapper What a contrast between #44 & #45: Class vs Crass
938033424886935552 2017-12-05 13:12:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NicolleDWallace @KattyKayBBC This made my morning!!!
938032612366364673 2017-12-05 13:09:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Perhaps @realDonaldTrump didn't make the list because his tweets are constantly full of lies? On the flip side, the classy, articulate scandal-free POTUS this country used to have is easy to read because his words don't sound like a 3rd grader!
938016933336641536 2017-12-05 12:07:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I'd rather watch Mueller take apart your Deutsche Bank records. Will he find dollars or rubles? Bank records can be as delicious as your tax returns!! Nyet?
937845554813353984 2017-12-04 00:46:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @MittRomney @jaketapper Oh, how those sweet words from years gone by can come back to haunt both you and POTUS. May Alabama drag itself out of the 19th century and join the rest of the civilized world!! They are all watching this freak show, by-the-way!
937833160007499776 2017-12-04 23:57:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> What part of 'no working with Russians' did he not understand? What size jumpsuit do you think he wears? Thanks for keeping us updated @RWPUSA !https://twitter.com/RWPUSA/status/937829014609301506
937705154119270400 2017-12-04 15:28:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Alabama would be taken off my bucket list and added to my boycott list. Come on, Alabama! Prove to us that you aren't stuck in the 19th century.
937676775286456322 2017-12-04 13:35:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @Reuters @realDonaldTrump You weren't raised in a Christian family and are currently a "Christian of Convenience"; but during my strict Catholic upbringing, it was drilled into me that lying is a sin. Flynn deserves no sympathy and neither do you. #FakeChristianLiars
937671010966315008 2017-12-04 13:12:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @jaketapper Sexual deviants of a feather stick together. Shame on you and shame on the man some call POTUS. Neither one of you is fit for office. Come on, Alabama, show the world that you are not stuck in the 19th century by soundly rejecting Roy Moore!
937663565573451781 2017-12-04 12:43:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Do you watch any real news? If you did you would see that this "witch hunt" is real, very real. To be correct, one must call it a warlock hunt. You might have gotten away with sexual misconduct; but you ain't escaping this one. Lock him up!!
937656191940829184 2017-12-04 12:13:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump The only good day in my future will be the day that you resign from office. I don't have a single stock or bond and neither do any of my friends; so your message is not directed at us. Perhaps, like your tax plan itself, it's directed as rich people only. Reverse Robin Hood!!
937654696159805440 2017-12-04 12:07:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump It's your tax giveaway to the rich. Why would any Democrat agree to that? So you really need a pedophile to accomplish your list? That says a lot about your list that not one Democrat will touch it; but a warped pedophile will. Billy Bush just called out YOUR own warped behavior.
937346260532576256 2017-12-03 15:42:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SenateGOP @senorrinhatch @SenateMajLdr @IvankaTrump And Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, And said unto them, It is written.

937310831921917953 2017-12-03 13:21:31 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Attacking our sacred democratic institutions, free press and the Rule of Law will be your undoing. You are unfit to lead this great country. You demonstrate just how unfit with every tweet. Though I am sure Mueller loves every word! Lock them all up, G-man!!
937306533305581568 2017-12-03 13:04:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @chucktodd @MeetThePress @nbc @SenatorCollins I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in your vote for the biggest tax grab in my lifetime. Trickle down has NEVER worked; yet you sold out your constituents to continue the flow of campaign contributions. Shame on you!!!
937303888180289536 2017-12-03 12:53:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @senorrinhatch @JoeNBC My 5 year-old autistic nephew is on CHIP. He still wears diapers and likely will continue to do so for a long time. The last job he applied for doesn't allow pull-ups; but I'll tell the liddle slacker to man up!! Senator Hatch - you disgust me!!
937302553787752448 2017-12-03 12:48:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Something must have gotten under your skin if you fired both Comey and Yates. Your team was so kind to have left an email trail for Mueller to follow. Emails, oh the irony!! Lock them up!
937187611843502080 2017-12-02 05:11:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Your knew Flynn lied to the FBI but instructed the FBI Director to "let it go"? You do realize it's a crime to lie to the FBI and it's also a crime to obstruct justice by firing the cop who wouldn't let it go? Where does Sally Yates fit in? Oh yeah, fired her too!
936962503820558336 2017-12-02 14:17:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Thanks, Bill! May moral Republicans find their souls and reject this pedophile.https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/936961085361590272
936953820571090948 2017-12-02 13:42:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Go, Alabama!! Some of us don't understand how anyone could vote for a pedophile and not the former prosecutor. But, this new breed of Christians in Trump's Republican Party actually carry the deplorable label with as much pride as the KKK. WWJD?
936948265102147584 2017-12-02 13:20:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I hope those "great" Republicans enjoy their victory. The people left out of your plan will speak in Nov 2018 and 2020. Of course, "some people say" that not all of you will be around for the comeuppance. Oh, how I love Mueller Time. Next?

936607427662725121 2017-12-01 14:46:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Fun Friday!!! Thanks, as always, @MalcolmNance, for your insight into the world of spies! You had their number from the get-go!https://twitter.com/MalcolmNance/status/936604466106830848
936582126874460161 2017-12-01 13:05:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> I think they are talking about your dreadful Twitter habit, @realDonaldTrump. I hope Melania didn't have her hopes set on high tea with the Queen. They also believe like Michelle Obama does that when you go low, they go high. No tea for you!!https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/936577473390764032
936579713891315713 2017-12-01 12:56:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MailOnline @DonaldJTrumpJr I see racism doesn't fall far from Trump's tree. Still attacking Native Americans while your daddy tweets snuff videos at Muslims? I hope you weren't planning to go to Great Britain with your daddy for tea time with the Queen. I hear they've putted that invite to the long grass!!
936568213885763585 2017-12-01 12:10:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Silly me...I could have sworn I saw Liddle Bob Corker trying to block your tax bill. Lo and behold...it adds $1 trillion more to the deficit that our children and grandchildren will pay for. Don't lie to the American people. It is Republicans who put the roadblocks up, not Dems.
936432158989737984 2017-11-30 03:09:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr What a crowd!! I haven't seen that many empty seats since Inauguration Day. Ho Ho Ho!
936425624100466688 2017-11-30 02:44:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I've not seen so many empty seats since your inauguration. P.S. The world just said to you, we're not all Christians. And about that tea time with the Queen? I've heard it's been putted into the "long grass". Europe is horrified because they've seen this before!!
936222562710831104 2017-11-30 13:17:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You & the other rich duffers & their trophy wives at the golf resorts are happy. The reality for the rest of America is that most working people live paycheck to paycheck. Your campaign promise to fight for America's workers is a con. Release your taxes & prove you don't benefit!
936214424959950849 2017-11-30 12:44:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> I can't help re-tweeting moral Republicans who recognize how dangerous and unstable our POTUS is. @realDonaldTrump, the whole world sees you and continues to say "WTF, America!". About that "tea time" with the Queen - on or off? I hear they don't want you there.https://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/936213100751179776
936208820484784128 2017-11-30 12:22:31 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Do you hear that @realDonaldTrump? No worker in America believes that the company they work for will turn around and give them a raise with that money. The only ones who believe it are your sheep who are so drunk on Kool-Aid that their brains don't work!
936208003321159680 2017-11-30 12:19:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @nytimes @realDonaldTrump How about your re-tweet of hate-filled videos that have outraged the world? Twitter should ban you for your misuse of their platform to spew hate. I have never been embarrassed of a POTUS before; but you win the prize. Please resign!!
936202501925122048 2017-11-30 11:57:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec How convenient for you to ignore the 8 years of economic growth you inherited from Obama. You know...the guy your boss thinks was born in Kenya. How you can lie for this man and call yourself a Christian is beyond me. WWJD? He'd throw the money changers out!
935877159251349504 2017-11-29 14:24:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RWPUSA It's a disgrace!! Thank You and other moral, patriotic Republicans for your courage to call out his behavior. I keep telling my fellow progressives to pay attention to what moral Republicans are saying. We can disagree on the finer points of policy; but never our patriotism!

935873117376806913 2017-11-29 14:08:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump When do we start the official investigation of POTUS for his past sexual misconduct? How many have accused you? The big con is on to suggest that the Access Hollywood tape wasn't you. Step right up, POTUS, first in line for the next investigation!!
935868522420355074 2017-11-29 13:50:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr How many have accused your father? If we are going to look at past sexual misconduct, your father needs to go to the front of the line. Trying to now deny the Access Hollywood tape might pass muster with your sheep, but the rest of us don't drink Kool-Aid & have brains!!
935864576205131778 2017-11-29 13:34:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics #NeverMyPOTUS He insults Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans and you Trump sheep still think he's the "second coming". @realDonaldTrump you embarrass this country daily. #NeverMyPOTUS
935862899561525250 2017-11-29 13:27:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @TrumpDC @EricTrump Do any of the products shown there have a Made in USA label? You Trumps are constantly hawking your foreign-made crap. Not a shred of economic patriotism in the whole lot of you!!
935846725163425793 2017-11-29 12:23:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump When does the review of YOUR sexual misconduct take place? People who live in glass houses...well, you should know the rest. Please stop acting like the National Inquirer and focus on doing your job! Let Mueller do his job & check out all those pesky Russia contacts!!
935844624047882240 2017-11-29 12:15:20 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, the people like you are the ones rich enough to care about the stock market. All previous Presidents seemed to understand that most Americans live paycheck to paycheck; but not the billionaire who has wanted for nothing his entire life!
935839674379022336 2017-11-29 11:55:40 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Still attacking the free press like the dictators throughout history? FYI - the White House looks ghastly in those gray and white colors. Reminded me of the confederacy. As for CNN, I hope Mueller gives them an exclusive on the next round of indictments!!
935838061794959362 2017-11-29 11:49:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Republican House. Republican Senate. Republican POTUS. Why are you whining about Democrats when you have majorities in both chambers? Actually on the "won big" thing...you got beat by almost 3 million votes. Some of us have morals & brains!
935638974227288065 2017-11-28 22:38:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> House majority. Senate majority. A POTUS in the White House. You broke it, you fix it, GOP! And tell @realDonaldTrump to start acting respectful to those in the minority (double entendre intended). This is all on you, GOP!https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/935615546506272768
935598740445937664 2017-11-28 19:58:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr President of the United States...make checks payable to Trump Organization for all golf resort visits, tee times and double servings of dessert for you know who. Not to mention all the foreigners staying at the D.C. Hotel = $$. Aren't you people rich enough yet?
935539788974768128 2017-11-28 16:04:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC Amen, Mika!! How @PressSec can shill for this racist man and call herself a Christian is beyond me.
935538004050845701 2017-11-28 15:56:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Native American leaders from the other Washington school @realDonaldTrump and @PressSec on how his words were received. Listen to them!! You have embarrassed us enough!!http://www.king5.com/news/politics/trumps-pocahontas-remark-is-insulting-native-american-leaders-say/495099170
935519797646835714 2017-11-28 14:44:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill She looks down at her tabbed binder for the appropriate prepared lie to the reporter's questions. @PressSec Also, the Scaramucci makeup tips make her look like Cruella de Vil. Proud to be part of the Christian Left AND becoming allies with moral Republicans!!
935513864401166337 2017-11-28 14:21:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump LOL...only your sheep would believe this. Good Gawd how you force Sarah to lie daily to defend you! So, the truth would be that your tax plan grants permanent tax breaks to corporations and raises taxes on low and middle income Americans. CBO! CBO! CBO!
935513214435000321 2017-11-28 14:18:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL, Junior! Where to start! Your daddy shows his racist stripes daily? Barbie...I mean Ivanka, teaches women how to succeed? You hawk Trump merchandise Made in China to your sheep? Complicit is Dictionary's word of the year? Or, Bob Mueller is a household name?
935509512336764928 2017-11-28 14:03:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @PressSec I asked at the start of 2017 who would want that Trump stain on their resume. The Neo-Puritans who have sold their souls to the devil. Proud to be part of the Christian Left pushing back against these Faux Christians and becoming allies with moral Republicans!!
935508222890229763 2017-11-28 13:58:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @StateDept @IvankaTrump Did she try to sell you some shoes? Go home, Barbie. I'd rather hear success stories from women who started with absolutely nothing and made millions than a billionaire's daughter who never wanted for a thing! Go home, Barbie!!
935503803926773760 2017-11-28 13:41:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @washingtonpost I'm just thankful that Americans are feeling the need to use the dictionary again. They are also learning about how the Rule of Law governs this country. I think Trump was absent that day when it was explained. Bone spurs strike again!!
935502883482513409 2017-11-28 13:37:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @IvankaTrump @StateDept @GES2017 Little rich girl needs to stop telling others how to be successful. Her daddy is a billionaire who gave her everything she has. How about showcasing someone who made something out of nothing? How refreshing would that be? Put Barbie back on her Park Avenue shelf.
935500083465822208 2017-11-28 13:26:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You start out talking about your wife in the first sixteen words and the rest is all about YOU. Your personality disorder is once again on display for the world to see. News Flash: It ain't always about you!
935498780291371010 2017-11-28 13:21:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nytimes And working Americans are making a list and checking it twice. The list is those who vote for this massive permanent giveaway to the rich, while raising the taxes on the poor and middle class. 2018 and 2020 will be when karma strikes back.
935495629538672640 2017-11-28 13:08:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Wow...is it possible for you to go 24 hours without going after a person of color? Your racism is appalling. Your leadership a joke. And...Mueller is lurking in the background connecting the treasonous dots!! Counting down the days until America is cleansed of this moral rot.
935485674181902336 2017-11-28 12:28:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill What a bunch of knuckle-dragging, pedophile-excusing people they have in AL. Is he mad that the WaPo sting operation conducted by the far right was exposed? That one made my Monday!
935481833495527425 2017-11-28 12:13:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @StateDept Tis easy, she says. All one needs is a billionaire daddy and manufacturing her crap in third world countries. Put Barbie back on the shelf. No one is interested in her "success" story. Give me a woman who started with nothing & made it big. Go home, @IvankaTrump!!!
935480063880859649 2017-11-28 12:06:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Actually, the real news of the day was that the colony has a POTUS who likes to issue racial slurs while "honoring" veterans. You do remember who the first and original Americans were, don't you? You dishonor our country every time you speak.
935298835378716672 2017-11-27 00:06:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Actually I think the Trophy goes to the planners of that WaPost sting operation. Busted! Who all was involved in the planning of that sting? WH, Bannon ?? Keep digging legitimate press!! Someone's fake news challenge just started taking on water!!
935297551770697734 2017-11-27 00:01:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @Eugene_Robinson This made my day!! Who was all involved in the planning of the sting operation? Keep Digging!!
935296658597744641 2017-11-27 23:57:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MSNBC From the man buried on a bluff overlooking my South Dakota home town: "If the Great Spirit had desired me to be a white man, he would have made me so in the first place." - Sitting Bull   It's time for this POTUS to stop his racial slurs @realDonaldTrump Enough!!
935294278279950336 2017-11-27 23:48:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Did the White House have their fingerprints on this sting operation or just Steve Bannon? Who in the press is going to dig in and uncover the whole rotten thing? Thankful for the press who, like Bob Mueller, aren't going anywhere!!
935273358706348033 2017-11-27 22:25:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @NicolleDWallace Thank You, Nicolle! I keep telling my fellow progressives that they need to follow more Republicans to see what they are doing to fight back against the evil. I have shared so many @BillKristol tweets on Facebook that some suspect I've switched parties. Nope, just finding allies.
935270417844994048 2017-11-27 22:13:38 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> I grew up near the Standing Rock and saw a man spit on for no other reason than he was an "Indian". Make these racists go back under their Trump Tower rock.https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/935256687111540747
935235868092010496 2017-11-27 19:56:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump shows his ugly, moral and racist core once again. He embarrasses us yet again!
935177004348932096 2017-11-27 16:02:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Call your Senators, Americans! The corporate pigs at the public trough are hungry!! Trump can try to put some lipstick on this pig; but it will remain a pig. Trickle Down has never worked and it won't work this time. Call your Senators and tell them NO WAY!!https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/935174652258762752
935175316049293312 2017-11-27 15:55:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Just curious if any of your gaudy junk has a Made in USA label. I've never seen a "First Family" who thought it more important to put their Trump label on their crap instead of one that says "proudly made by workers in the USA". Zero economic patriotism = Zero dollars spent by me
935157089973841920 2017-11-27 14:43:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> It is why we love @mosesbread72.  He makes us proud on and off the field!!https://twitter.com/KellyDrodofsky/status/934938575090495488
935154607860334594 2017-11-27 14:33:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump LOL...still not buying it. You can put lipstick on a pig and yet it remains a pig. The pigs at the trough are rich folks who still won't give their workers a raise. Many are like the Trumps who manufacture their products offshore and have ZERO economic patriotism. Not buying it!!
935142767197528065 2017-11-27 13:46:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Who cares? They are both women who would marry a monster because he's rich. There is a term for women like that. Neither one of them brings honor to the White House or country. Beautiful, rich and nothing else to offer. Sad!!
935134708953780226 2017-11-27 13:14:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Talk about doubling down...there is a certain sexual predator who some ignorant sheep elected as their POTUS. Oh well, it will be over soon because Mueller Ain't Going Away!! And a few of you will find new government housing. Nyet?
934968251565481984 2017-11-26 02:12:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @BillKristol My grandfather was an Irish Catholic Democrat who served as both Fire Chief and Police Chief while also being a long-serving county commissioner beloved and respected by all. His best friend was Chair of local GOP. They fought fires together and labels didn't much matter.
934795065658040325 2017-11-26 14:44:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You mean former US Attorney Doug Jones who prosecuted KKK members? You'd rather have a pedophile than a prosecutor? You need an R to get your tax bill passed. WWJD? "My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."
934786358614278144 2017-11-26 14:10:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Of course you want a pedophile in the Senate. You are now saying the Access Hollywood tape wasn't you? You are the reason Republicans are fleeing the party. It's okay...Mueller Ain't Going Anywhere; but perhaps a few of the deplorable faithful will find other public housing.
934779023896428544 2017-11-26 13:41:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @WSJ @IvankaTrump Doesn't everyone want an unlicensed electrician and a stylist with no training? Little rich girl who doesn't build a SINGLE product on the shores of the US needs to stop telling us we need to be like her sweat shops in 3rd world countries. ZERO economic patriotism = $$ for Trumps
934589620808949760 2017-11-25 01:08:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump MAGA: Mueller Ain't Going Away. That news is SO REAL that you can take it to the bank and cash it. Not a Russian bank, mind you. Real news doesn't need to go outside the country to find banks willing to loan it money. Nyet?
934434256792596480 2017-11-25 14:51:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @BillKristol We can agree to disagree on policy; but when it comes to spotting and calling out our current insanity, it makes me feel hopeful that we will make it through this mess as Americans. Thanks, Bill!
934424411343482881 2017-11-25 14:11:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Make check from taxpayers payable to "The Trump Organization". It irritates the snot out of me that Camp David is not good enough for @realDonaldTrump. It was just fine for the other "great" presidents in history. On second thought...never mind! MAGA - Mueller Ain't Going Away
934414906190848000 2017-11-25 13:34:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Who would take this woman seriously on the world stage? Only those who want her to open a sweat shop in their third-world country. Zero economic patriotism from this Trump and all Trumps. $$$$$ is their only motivation. MAGA: Mueller Ain't Going Away, @IvankaTrump
934412243067854850 2017-11-25 13:23:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @trumpwinery @DonaldJTrumpJr Perhaps Time will make it their wine of the year? MAGA - Mueller Ain't Going Away
934057120810516480 2017-11-24 13:52:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Of course @realDonaldTrump is playing golf again. And, once again, at a Trump golf course that the America people will get stuck paying for. What's wrong with Camp David? His company doesn't get paid millions every time he visits!!
934051318049599489 2017-11-24 13:29:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill It's ALWAYS about him. He never learned to put the we before the me. Raised as a spoiled rich brat and still acts that way on the world stage for all to see.
934050277895766017 2017-11-24 13:25:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr The best cherry on top of that Thanksgiving pie was the news of Flynn cooperating with Mueller. Americans will celebrate once Mueller has the goods on all of you. MAGA? It was already great before Russia got their hooks into some of you!! #MuellerTime #ThenWeCelebrate
933694325245992960 2017-11-23 13:50:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Bush, Clinton and Obama did it in person. Perhaps you saw the photos of the 4 of you - three with the troops and one on a golf course on Thanksgiving Eve? Quite a contrast!! And the other three didn't send a bill to the taxpayers made payable to their golf resort! Nyet?
933353778429902849 2017-11-22 15:17:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Yeah, it's all fake news isn't it, Junior? How many Hitler comparisons have there been with the current POTUS using the same propaganda against the media to mollify the sheep? Do I hear Mueller's footsteps closing in?
933309561984892928 2017-11-22 12:21:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Your petty is showing again. Did he not kiss your ring? Did he not genuflect at the feet of Trump? How dare he not bow down to the narcissist. Give it a rest, go play golf since you're billing us for it anyways.
933308283837825024 2017-11-22 12:16:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump "When he realized what Trump was after, he turned cold and blunt. "Mr. Trump," Rozelle told him, "as long as I or any of my heirs are involved in the NFL, you will never be a franchise owner in the league." Still holding a grudge after all these years, I see!!!!
933306804540391424 2017-11-22 12:10:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Has any of the Trump manufacturing found its way to the shores of the USA? People with zero economic patriotism will put their bottom line before all else. Camp David was just fine for previous presidents, why not you? Silly me...Trump can't bill taxpayers for Camp David. $$$$$
933149604538806272 2017-11-21 01:46:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I sent Bill my Best Wishes from a liberal feminist working stiff who doesn't own a single jet!!
933120291726794753 2017-11-21 23:49:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @BillKristol Thanks, Bill! Best wishes from a liberal feminist working stiff who doesn't own a single jet!!!
933070635370082305 2017-11-21 20:32:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Looks like you also just pardoned a serial pedophile with your remarks about Alabama. You couldn't be more off base with your "we don't need whataboutism". What we don't need is a pedophile who preyed on girls anywhere in our government!! You embarrass yet again!!
932982459074936833 2017-11-21 14:42:06 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL...Who would be at the top of the creep's list? That Access Hollywood tape bragging grab 'em by the pussy father of yours? You are a hypocrite for never addressing the elephant in the room. Oh...speaking of elephants...LOL!!!!
932797056795549697 2017-11-20 02:25:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill "Del Rio also replied to Trumps tweet attacking Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch, telling Trump to take more time being President of the United States and less time trying to shame. @realDonaldTrump You should listen to her!!
932794510953693184 2017-11-20 02:15:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill She would trade children for a tax bill for the rich? This whole administration sickens me.
932793640736342016 2017-11-20 02:11:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan You really think American families who can't pay an unexpected bill of $400 believe that your tax shift to the wealthy will help them? LOL...here's your pennies, working stiffs - the rich guys you work for will take the rest. Not buying it!!
932619761459986432 2017-11-20 14:40:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNNPolitics Stay in your own lane @realDonaldTrump!! Why do you spend SO MUCH Twitter time going after people of color? We all know the answer to that one as evidenced by the deplorable people, like racist Jeff Sessions, in your administration. This is abuse of power!!
932618914835468288 2017-11-20 14:37:31 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I am sickened by any person of "faith" who would allow a pedophile to become a "leader". Having been raised Catholic, I know they existed and preyed on children. Should he win, Alabama will be taken off my southern states bucket list trip. And, I'll support a boycott of AL.
932614400594165764 2017-11-20 14:19:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan Again, you crack me up!! The Republican party is the party of the rich whose base includes those who would defend a pedophile and a sexual misbehaving POTUS. Of course they will believe this tax shift will benefit them. Not buying it..I can read!!
932417411424198659 2017-11-19 01:16:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Just curious if Trump still needs more evidence in order to make a "moral" decision by taking back his endorsement of Roy Moore? Oh, he's too busy going after the basketball player's dad...silly me!! Moral rot is what @SteveSchmidtSES coined it and he nailed it!
932401861549686784 2017-11-19 00:15:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @Comey Nailed it. Thanks!!
932401038887284736 2017-11-19 00:11:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump So, this means that you'll tell Junior to stop trophy hunting? Does he have his elephant tail mounted on his wall? Other animal parts as well? Teach your children well, they say!
932395859924328448 2017-11-19 23:51:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump OMG...you must stop behaving like this!!! You were elected POTUS and you act like an immature six-year old. Why do you seem to zero in on people of color instead of a pedophile in Alabama or your own sexual misconduct? You disgrace us daily!
932390906732220417 2017-11-19 23:31:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Anyone who says NO to the biggest tax shift in history is a hero in my book. Reverse Robin Hood on display as the rich pigs come to eat at the taxpayer trough. Jet and golf resort write-offs...all the things working people don't have! And billions in estate tax Trumps will save!!
932388128366587904 2017-11-19 23:20:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan LOL...bigger paychecks for CEOs and high earners, you mean!! You can put lipstick on a pig and it's still a pig. The trough is being filled for the piggies; but since only 1 in 4 Americans support your tax giveway, Good Luck in 2018!
932368488890433536 2017-11-19 22:02:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @SenBobCorker @NicolleDWallace Another embarrassing example of Trump showing the world what a petty, petty man he is. If you don't kiss his ring, he calls out some basketball player's dad to show the world what a stud he is!! Yeah, not one person is impressed w/your petty, dude!!
932361462604894208 2017-11-19 21:34:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Oh, dear, Lord! The insanity runs deep in the Trump family. @EricTrump My first belly laugh of the day. I can now see why SNL has a hoot doing scenes that include you. LOLhttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/932360103193432064
932360458006282241 2017-11-19 21:30:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> It is ALWAYS about stroking your ego. I've never seen a person so into themselves and no one else. You shame us by attacking this father.

932054371319275520 2017-11-18 01:14:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @HumaneSociety @TheEllenShow Ellen - you are more than a national treasure, you are an international treasure. #BeKindToElephants
932023704002879488 2017-11-18 23:12:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JoyAnnReid Love it, Joy!! I can't resist doing that myself at times. Two, to, too, their, there and they're are also some fun ones. It really is that simple!!
931880618819862529 2017-11-18 13:43:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Wow...I don't even know where to start!! I'll just say this...Robert Mueller will take you and your rotten team down. Papa, Flynn boys and Manafort will spill the beans. It may not be today; but if I know one true thing about my country, it is that justice will be done!
931879116235665409 2017-11-18 13:37:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MalcolmNance @MazMHussain It is indeed sad to see otherwise smart people (my h.s. math teacher, my own niece) unable or unwilling to employ their critical thinking skills. Faithful Faux News watchers who get fed a steady diet of red meat that apparently fogs the brain. It's all I got to 'splain this mess!
931876734072381440 2017-11-18 13:28:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Didn't Trump walk into a dressing room full of TEEN GIRLS in various states of undress? Birds of feather recognize each other and stick like glue!
931871393657978880 2017-11-18 13:07:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Weren't you the guy who walked into the dressing room where teen girls were in states of undress? TEEN GIRLS...you are no better than Roy Moore. Weren't you the guy who said they let you grab women by the PUSSY when you're famous? SICK!!!
931862050321481728 2017-11-18 12:30:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Sadly, it doesn't take much to "outsmart" Trump. When you put a reality TV host up against a KGB officer, the results are not surprising! Played, outsmarted and the laughing stock on the world!!
931859829718581250 2017-11-18 12:21:11 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NealMcCoy I don't need to watch your video to tell you that I will never buy one of your albums again. You must be one of Trump's minions who is being used to divide Americans. STOP IT!
931710281553551361 2017-11-17 02:26:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> Got a wee bit of outrage from that one, did we POTUS? I guess that photo of Junior with his trophy sickened people!!https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/931685146415255552
931605506631729152 2017-11-17 19:30:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @Trump @DonaldJTrumpJr How many, if any, of your products have the Made in USA label? Foolish, ignorant people will buy it no matter if it was Made in China. Not me...I'm wide awake and have the economic patriotism you all seem to lack!
931544451159175168 2017-11-17 15:27:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr P.S. Thinking about who it was that walked into a dressing room with naked teen girls. Be honest (dot, dot, dot) does that sound like Moore behavior to you? You opened this can of whoop ass all by yourself, junior!!! Own it!
931540217667784704 2017-11-17 15:11:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Don't tell @realDonaldTrump. He has pretty much destroyed everything with Obama's name on it out of petty ego. Apparently he didn't like being laughed at during WH Correspondent's Dinner. I watch it on a regular basis to smile these days!!
931537511368704000 2017-11-17 15:00:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NPR Hurry up, Mueller!! These entitled rich people think they can do whatever they want, ignore that which provides the bread crumb trail and laugh at us. Lock them all up!!
931532545686040578 2017-11-17 14:40:40 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I love a good wave @SpeakerRyan. We have votes on taking away health care, cutting the legs from underneath Medicare & Medicaid, and now a vote on a tax giveaway to the rich. And, let's not forget an unfit POTUS!! Wave, wave, wave!!!
931531172915560448 2017-11-17 14:35:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nytimes Only if @realDonaldTrump is shown the door as well. He was caught on tape telling Billy Bush that he liked to grab women by the pussy. Franken apologized and said to investigate him. Trump denies and calls women liars. Who should go?
931529409076408321 2017-11-17 14:28:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr P.S. Is it still alleged when there is an Access Hollywood video? You conveniently forget about the sexual deviant in your own family! Of course, you're getting $1 billion in tax breaks so you don't really care. Nyet? Hurry the hell up, Mueller!!
931519934185607169 2017-11-17 13:50:33 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill You break it, you own it!! Letting CHIP expire is beyond mean-spirited. I have an autistic nephew on CHIP @realDonaldTrump. His family isn't rich. His family can't afford to pay for what he needs. Mean, rich, heartless GOP!
931506730386653184 2017-11-17 12:58:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MalcolmNance @chrislhayes Love it, Chris!!! My morning chuckle!!
931500872244146182 2017-11-17 12:34:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Seriously? Aren't you the one who said that you can do whatever you want to women because you're famous?  Grab them by the pussy, he said. You can do anything. You OWN THOSE WORDs and we won't let you forget them!!
931499967717392386 2017-11-17 12:31:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump  Nineteen! I'd love to see a Special Counsel appointed just to delve into those nineteen claims. You should be careful how you talk about this on Twitter. You leave yourself wide open to criticism of your own sexual behavior!!https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/931215079181340672
931498518283456512 2017-11-17 12:25:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Wow...look who is talking about sexual harassment!!! Access Hollywood tape? Look in the mirror! You have no say in these matters when you have a long line of victims from your own deplorable behavior!!
931497558676926464 2017-11-17 12:21:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump The 1% will get these great results. Most Americans don't have a dime in the stock market and most believe that failed Trickle Down won't help them one bit. Who are you kidding? This is YOUR feather my own nest plan with $1 BILLION in tax savings for people named Trump, nyet?
931496406530932736 2017-11-17 12:17:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Democrats don't want to give the Trump family $1 billion in tax relief. Not accurate? Release your tax returns and prove otherwise. You are confusing us with your ignorant sheep who watch Faux News and believe it to be real. The rest of us are wide awake and ready to block!
931175778183626757 2017-11-16 15:03:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Could it be sheer coincidence that women did so well in last week's election? In my WA State, we elected a Indian-American woman of Sikh heritage. And, her victory swung the State Senate majority back to the Ds. The suburbs spoke loudly!!
931172573479501824 2017-11-16 14:50:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nytimes Pop Quiz: A) Dementia, B) Cut-and-Paste condolences, C) So many mass shootings, one can't keep track or D) All of the Above.
931144661560786945 2017-11-16 12:59:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan Once again, I'm LOL this morning. $25 billion in cuts to Medicare helps people how? You may get your tax plan through the House; but next year's mid-terms are going to be deliciously fun!! P.S. Thanks for the Dem majority in WA state senate!!!!
931140325711609857 2017-11-16 12:42:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @seanhannity is a poor excuse for a "journalist". He's a deplorable man who makes excuses for pedophiles. Two additional women come forward yesterday and Sean just ignores it. This is why people who watch Faux News are ignorant sheep!!
930951292587036672 2017-11-15 00:10:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @AliVelshi I was astounded watching it. The same disrespect was shown to Don Lemon as well from this man. I think Steve Schmidt nailed it by calling this out as moral rot within the Republican Party. P.S. I enjoy your smart fiscal analysis. Keep doing great work!
930948247450820608 2017-11-15 23:58:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan The "average"; but not all. Your plan gives permanent tax cuts to corporations, but only 10 years for the rest of us? How is that fair to those who work to make this country great? It's not. Your snow job ain't working, Paul! 25% approval?
930909265375608837 2017-11-15 21:23:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Thanks, France!! So jealous that you have a forward-thinking leader instead of an ignorant strongman wanna-be. I am also sad that my USA is no longer the greatest nation on earth. Thanks for another world embarrassment, Trump!
930795360481456129 2017-11-15 13:51:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SpeakerRyan LOL...you are confusing us with Trump's ignorant base. Trickle down economics has never worked...ever!! Any middle class American who believes you are going to LOWER their taxes is delusional! Someone has to pay for the 1% tax cuts!!
930783129882599424 2017-11-15 13:02:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL (dot, dot, dot) some of us have critical thinking skills and actually READ! If you Trumps actually loved this country you would manufacture your products here. Not one ounce of economic patriotism in the stinking lot of you! Fooled by you? Nyet!!!!
930771437954129922 2017-11-15 12:16:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @ShepNewsTeam @NicolleDWallace In these times where the press is under constant attack, I appreciate the honest reporting. We can disagree on issues as Ds and Rs; but when it comes to the moral fabric of our country, we should all be and act like Americans. Signed a liberal Dem.
930767851484352512 2017-11-15 12:02:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN @PapaJohns More than one reason to not eat your crappy pizza. Stop stealing your workers' wages!! Not one slice!!!
930764766624149504 2017-11-15 11:49:47 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump The FBI & law enforcement arrived 10 days ago. This is news? Oh, yeah, you've been really busy with BFFs Putin and Duterte - you know, the ones who jail (or worse) their free press!
930581588282261504 2017-11-14 23:41:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @DonaldJTrumpJr Wikileaks, Wikileaks, Wikileaks!! You Trumps can try to distract your ignorant sheep; but Robert Mueller ain't no sheep!! Oh, and your BFF, Julian Assange? Wasn't he living in the Ecuador Embassy hiding from sexual assault charges when you colluded?
930431049254838273 2017-11-14 13:43:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Have you ever seen a sadder bunch of bumblers? They can't even collude without leaving a bread crumb trail for Robert Mueller to easily follow! A Twitter, Facebook and speeches out on the stump bread crumb trail, all nicely dated & time-stamped!!
930424645651636225 2017-11-14 13:18:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill VP seems to be caught between a rock and a hard place. Get used to it, Mike, the good times are yet to come!! It is Mueller time for the whole stinking lot of you!
930422391712333824 2017-11-14 13:09:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Only when you mess with our children! Love it to hear some GOP women say that they are a mother first and a Republican second!!!!
930417961948422144 2017-11-14 12:51:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Trump will pick a pedophile over doing the right thing. I am heartened to hear some Alabama women say that they are mothers first, Republicans second. As it should be! Shame on any of you who say otherwise!!!
930397018769391616 2017-11-14 11:28:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Does this mean that @seanhannity is asking his faithful sheep to smash their Volvos too? Sorry, Sean, but most companies don't want their brand associated with your brand of pedophile-excusing politics. Shame on you!!
930065119383453698 2017-11-13 13:29:38 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @IvankaTrump @FoxNews Faux News viewers also think it's just fine for a man in his 30s to date children. Of course, they will lap up this tax plan - even though it increases their taxes. You can't fix stupid. Steve Schmidt nailed it...moral rot!!!
930062967881658368 2017-11-13 13:21:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @IvankaTrump @FoxNews Move your manufacturing to the shores of your country if you are so hyped about invigorating the economy. By "your country", I mean the USA, not Mother Russia!!
930062533989244929 2017-11-13 13:19:22 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @IvankaTrump So, how does it work when you manufacture ALL of your products overseas? Do you still get the $$$$$. Of course you do. Not one ounce of economic patriotism from any of you Trumps! Hurry the hell up, Mueller!!!
929731252340453377 2017-11-12 15:22:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SteveSchmidtSES Thank You for calling out the moral rot that is currently invading the GOP. I enjoy your commentary and your honesty. As a liberal Dem, I can honestly say that @SenJohnMcCain has always been a hero to me. We can disagree on issues, but he's still a hero!!
929727574586015744 2017-11-12 15:08:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I'm sending messages this morning to companies who advertise on Hannity's show where I spend $: I will have purchased my last product from you if you continue advertising on Hannity's show.

What I'm going nuts about is your daughter telling lies to the American people every day. Keep the coat...stop the lies! I thought Christians weren't supposed to lie!
929530660510769152 2017-11-11 02:05:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill "There" always playing politics? But, he went to the BEST schools and is SO SMART. Bad enough for the world to see him with his strongman wanna be crush on Putin; but could he at least get his grammar correct? Is that asking too much?
929523243676864512 2017-11-11 01:36:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Thank You @SenJohnMcCain for continuing to be the Patriot in this situation. @realDonaldTrump could take lessons from you on how to conduct oneself as a statesman instead of looking like a strongman-wanna be with a crush on Putin.
929515120652304384 2017-11-11 01:04:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Just stop! You and your team are being investigated for collusion with the Russians. Not Hillary Clinton. Not Barack Obama. It is Donald J. Trump being investigated with indictments already starting to land for your comrades. Hurry up Mueller!!
929509726374707200 2017-11-11 00:42:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump "There" always playing politics? Shall we try "They're" instead? There, there now, don't you feel better? We don't because we like our POTUS to be a little bit smarter than that.
928241499426271232 2017-11-08 12:43:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump THANK YOU so much for helping us (Dems) take control of the WA State Senate!! The winner is a Sikh American who beat her GOP opponent by 10 points. Who was the biggest loser last night?
928085146267394048 2017-11-07 02:21:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Love the spin! You lost Virginia. You lost New Jersey. And, you are going to lose GOP control of WA St Senate. Well done!
927909658550984704 2017-11-07 14:44:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nytimes Sad that the former greatest nation on earth will now stand alone. Good job, Trumpers! @realDonaldTrump embarrasses us every day!
927869600657637376 2017-11-07 12:05:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You mean you are working very hard to take deductions away from average people and give that money to your rich friends. No Way!!!
927659316659621890 2017-11-06 22:09:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Should the TRO I & all my family carry to protect us from mentally ill abusive ex-military guy fail, I don't want your tears. I want action!
927536369580130304 2017-11-06 14:01:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump And then do absolutely NOTHING about the carnage. You were the one to overturn Obama's mentally ill background check. Aren't you proud?

927182527168626688 2017-11-05 14:35:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Your faux outrage is a hoot, Paul! You know that this agreement was for the GENERAL election; but GOP can do nothing but lie!!!
926790569128366080 2017-11-04 12:37:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump But the Trump Klan still manufactures its crap overseas. NOT ONE OF THOSE JOBS was created by Trumps having economic patriotism! Shame!
926778445345931264 2017-11-04 11:49:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How many JOBS, JOBS, JOBS did Trump Klan add by manufacturing their crap in USA? ZERO, ZERO, ZERO economic patriotism!
926593757796909056 2017-11-03 23:35:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @IvankaTrump How many of those new jobs are Trump Klan moving their manufacturing to the U.S. so they have MadeInUSA label? I'll bet that number to be 0!
926431515776397312 2017-11-03 12:51:00 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Manafort, Gates, Papa are only the first round. Be ready for Trump Klan to receive more greetings (indictments) from Mueller. We deserve it!
926430912480292865 2017-11-03 12:48:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RepVisclosky @JeffFortenberry @SecretaryPerry Are there no nuclear women in your working group? Gawd, it's like being back in the stone ages with nothing but men running the show!!

925018465752072192 2017-10-30 15:16:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Doesn't matter if the feds have him by the short hairs and can flip him. Do your lawyers know you are tweeting?
925017970182467584 2017-10-30 15:14:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump George Papadopoulos, secretly pleaded guilty, Robert Muellers probe into Russian interference in 2016 U.S. presidential & is cooperating!
924994732442271744 2017-10-30 13:41:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Should @realDonaldTrump fire Mueller, we will have a full blown constitutional crisis. Make America Great Again/Trumpistan version.
924987009080238083 2017-10-30 13:11:03 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @washingtonpost Conspiracy, money laundering and more! @realDonaldTrump really knows how to choose his people. Next?
924980626725277696 2017-10-30 12:45:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump 1st indictments are in and the guy who managed your campaign FOR FREE just turned himself in. How will FAUX NEWS spin that?

924706364278030337 2017-10-29 18:35:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump The indictments aren't timed around your leg goals. They come when the evidence is conclusive - like a grand jury found. It's Mueller Time!!
924630421274427392 2017-10-29 13:34:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill And it's not even Monday yet! @realDonaldTrump It's Mueller time. Cheers!!
924629572045307904 2017-10-29 13:30:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump $1.5 trillion cut to Medicaid & Medicare after you promised not to touch it. Kick grandma out of nursing home to pay for 1% tax cuts. Shame!
924370551551881216 2017-10-28 20:21:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Just imagine what all the $$ @realDonaldTrump has spent playing golf would do for nation's opioid crisis. No $$ for crisis, but he can golf?
924367799249551360 2017-10-28 20:10:31 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @PressSec Sure, if you are part of the 1%. You will kick grandma out of nursing home to pay for tax breaks for your boss. I'm wide awake. Nice try!
924330545756045312 2017-10-28 17:42:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @POTUS @PressSec LOL...you people will try to spin anything to distract from the coming indictments. It's Mueller Time! Cheers!!
924261262900412417 2017-10-28 13:07:11 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @robreiner Nailed it, Rob! It's Mueller Time and the BIG ORANGE FISH is now freaking out about which little fish will flip on him. Cheers!!
924253687790235648 2017-10-28 12:37:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump He's a real Christian...you should take notes. Won't stop Mueller coming down hard on the Trump team. It's finally Mueller Time! Cheers!!
924110461519269888 2017-10-27 03:07:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Won't Monday be interesting to see just which of your squad has been charged by Mueller's grand jury today? Lock them up!!!
924018693813673984 2017-10-27 21:03:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Shame on you, @PressSec for once again lying for @realDonaldTrump. History is being written and you will be reflected poorly.
924017725239734272 2017-10-27 20:59:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @washingtonpost 3. He's a bully
924014472208949249 2017-10-27 20:46:32 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Isn't she worth like $75 million? I'm sure she'll take the money & kick grandma off Medicaid too, you heartless immoral people!
924013559717142528 2017-10-27 20:42:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Dems bought legitimate op research. Russia bought itself a puppet. Who flips first - Manafort or Flynn? Or have they already?
923555096608194560 2017-10-26 14:21:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Loved former Senator Coburn's take on @realDonaldTrump personality disorder! The rest of the GOP are complicit in their silence.
923554249564229633 2017-10-26 14:17:46 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @MillionWMentors @IvankaTrump How about more American jobs by moving your manufacturing to US? NOT ONE of your products is made here. ZERO economic patriotism!!
923553966805303297 2017-10-26 14:16:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump LOL - Sean Hannity wouldn't know the truth if it was staring him in the face. Complicit journalist who covers for an unfit POTUS.
923540831474032641 2017-10-26 13:24:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @RepMarthaRoby @RepKevinYoder @RepKristiNoem @SenDeanHeller @SenCapito @SenMikeLee @SenRubioPress @IvankaTrump @SenatorTimScott Perhaps Ivanka could give people jobs by manufacturing her products in the USA. ZERO American made = not one ounce of economic patriotism!
923539172626857985 2017-10-26 13:17:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @washingtonpost Is anyone surprised that @realDonaldTrump would cross yet another ethical line? Hurry the hell up, Mueller!
923538343899447297 2017-10-26 13:14:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump told yet another lie after totally dropping the ball. Guess bullying black NFL and Gold Star widows is how he rolls.
923159351518380032 2017-10-25 12:08:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump The big winners will be the 1% and Trumps. Please don't confuse the rest of us with your ignorant sheep. We're wide awake & on to you!
923150922909224960 2017-10-25 11:35:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You knew what you signed up for, but I know it hurts anyways. Feel better now, POTUS? Yeah, Mrs. Johnson didn't either!!!!
923150681409708037 2017-10-25 11:34:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump No, they are leaving because they don't want to be associated with you and your destructive governing style. Lack of character - yours!
922929664523321344 2017-10-24 20:55:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins Praying for more patriotic moral Republicans to find their voice without having to announce they aren't running.
922909714148556800 2017-10-24 19:36:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @ErikWemple @washingtonpost @PressSec  You knew what you signed up for, but I know it hurts anyways. Do you feel better now, Sarah? Neither did Mrs. Johnson.
922900935008960512 2017-10-24 19:01:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill What a pig. Who cares what this racist fascist thinks? Why are you quoting him? He was fired along with Bannon for a reason!
922836697385115648 2017-10-24 14:46:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How lovely for the 1% - you know, the ones who will receive the lion's share of your tax cut proposal. Attack any GOP senators today? LOL

922818131310948352 2017-10-24 13:32:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump The more you tweet your nonsense, the more you show how unfit you are to serve the American people. #AlertTheDaycareStaff Go @SenBobCorker!
922812491570102272 2017-10-24 13:10:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I can't believe @realDonaldTrump got caught in yet another lie about Gold Star families. Unfit. Unethical. Compulsive Liar. Never my POTUS!
922808699990589440 2017-10-24 12:55:13 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SenBobCorker Go get him, Senator! He embarrasses us every single day with his lies and attacks on fellow Americans. UNFIT TO LEAD!!
922807491242573824 2017-10-24 12:50:25 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I hope @realDonaldTrump was watching & listening! He has so failed the commander in chief test. FAILED!!!!!!

922527310242131968 2017-10-23 18:17:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Stop bullying this Gold Star widow and start acting like Commander In Chief! You disrespect our military with your refusal to apologize.
922525809075568641 2017-10-23 18:11:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Please start with your husband. In particular, tell him to stop bullying a Gold Star widow. Shameful @realDonaldTrump. Shameful!!
922466487780065291 2017-10-23 14:15:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Give me a @SenJohnMcCain hero any day over a @realDonaldTrump bone spurs coward. McCain still serves with dignity. Trump never has.
922444464357916673 2017-10-23 12:47:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Did you see the middle school football players attacked in own locker room by teammates, dry humped and called racial slurs? #TakeAKneeNFL
922442860791603200 2017-10-23 12:41:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump So you think you get extra credit for getting his name right? Talk about grading on the curve! Love John McCain, hero, not a bone spur man!
922086184603484160 2017-10-22 13:04:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Awake yet Republicans? Listen to McCain and Bush! We've seen this before. He was called Hitler.
922082810063495171 2017-10-22 12:50:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Good to see those Gold Star family letters finally started to arrive on Friday for those killed in August. Unfit Dishonest Shameful POTUS!!!
922062452983918592 2017-10-22 11:29:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I cannot see that intelligent, thoughtful caring former POTUS calling anyone "Sons of bitches". @realDonaldTrump has no problem being ugly!
921730673534156801 2017-10-21 13:31:32 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump P.S. Could you at least shut up on the day of his funeral? Go golf or something instead of your continued disrespect. Shameful!
921730021760237570 2017-10-21 13:28:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You are still riding the Obama economic wave. You've done nothing - passed nothing - to take credit for stock market!!
921724784018210817 2017-10-21 13:08:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill I thought at least a 4-star general would have honor and integrity. I was SO WRONG! Shameful, @GeneralJFKellly !!!
921724121582469122 2017-10-21 13:05:30 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You and @GeneralJFKellly both owe her an apology for your lies. I thought Kelly had honor and integrity. Sadly, I was so wrong. Apologize!!
921723503312646144 2017-10-21 13:03:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump My favorite shade from across the pond from Winston Churchhill's grandson: #thenfixguncontrolyoudafttwerp Nailed it!!
921547564784029698 2017-10-20 01:23:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You and General Kelly owe Congresswoman Wilson an apology. I thought at least Kelly had some honor and wouldn't lie. Shame!!
921365613276045318 2017-10-20 13:20:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN Tis sad seeing General Kelly as the clean-up guy after the elephant parade. @realDonaldTrump started it all & invoked Kelly's son. Shame!
921364841712926720 2017-10-20 13:17:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump That soldier was a part of her mentorship program since he was a little boy & close to the family for decades. I believe her/them over you!!
921364414216921088 2017-10-20 13:16:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How much tax savings will the Trump Klan receive from this tax cut plan? Since you did a flim-flam on your tax returns, we'll never know.
921107316535001088 2017-10-19 20:14:32 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nytimes With all due respect, he should have been stunned when his boss started this on Monday and then invoked Kelly's son on Tuesday. Shame!!
921048857676357633 2017-10-19 16:22:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump Why do you continue to lie to us when it is SO EASY to fact check you? Talk about disrespecting our military!!!!!
920989772281081856 2017-10-19 12:27:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Too delusional this morning, POTUS!! Is Mueller getting a little too close to the oval office? Me thinks so! Lock him (you) up!!
920989308697305088 2017-10-19 12:25:37 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump And Russia hacked our election and installed you as their puppet. Not a puppet. Not a puppet. YES YOU ARE a POTUS Puppet!
920982016723525632 2017-10-19 11:56:38 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Some of those folks also believe you are a devout Christian and we know that ain't a fact. Will you ever act like a real POTUS? Doubtful.
920980832533168128 2017-10-19 11:51:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Tea Party Republicans will vote to increase the red ink just to give you and other fat cats estate tax windfalls. Yipee! Wait..I'm not rich!
920784761089433600 2017-10-18 22:52:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump It's too bad that China leads the world in solar energy. That is the future. Not coal. Of course you deny climate change, so we're doomed!!
920784082685935616 2017-10-18 22:50:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Check out Doug Baldwin and Roger Goddell's letter to Senate Judiciary Committee. I think the players know. Ms. Lahren is clueless!!!
920783610294050816 2017-10-18 22:48:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @Paula_White @WhiteHouse @IvankaTrump Oh, are they part of the Estate Tax Club as well? This tax deal is for the super rich and nothing about it makes America great again!!!
920756264086282241 2017-10-18 20:59:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @fema @realDonaldTrump Oh, you noticed the fires out west? Good, now next step is to listen to FEMA on climate change!!!
920755926113468416 2017-10-18 20:58:14 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill No wonder they booted him off their state supreme court - no once, but twice.
920755762946760704 2017-10-18 20:57:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump No, apparently Trump Klan need more tax relief. How about Trump Klan manufacture in the US and show some ECONOMIC PATRIOTISM!!!!!
920755438798303232 2017-10-18 20:56:18 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @IvankaTrump And how much does Daddy and Trump Klan make off this deal? No estate tax? Must be a bundle! Why don't YOU manufacture in USA?
920755061113757697 2017-10-18 20:54:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NFL @realDonaldTrump Players have collective bargaining rights and no POTUS should insert himself in that process. How about you start respecting the military!!!
920655694981865472 2017-10-18 14:19:57 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Subsidies of cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments decrease the out-of-pocket costs for low-income people. Be truthful, for once!!!!!
920654552843431937 2017-10-18 14:15:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Okay, where's the "proof" @realDonaldTrump? Should we expect it at about the same time as your tax returns?
920654008129282050 2017-10-18 14:13:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump They are subsidies for low-income people, not insurance companies. Be honest, for once. Get out of the way and let the process work!!!!!
920643105631625218 2017-10-18 13:29:55 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Where is said proof? We will expect it to be released ASAP - long form, please!!
920613509834063873 2017-10-18 11:32:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump So, publish the proof, release your tax returns and tell us how the world picks on poor Donny. Such a Liar-In-Chief!!!
920611148382199808 2017-10-18 11:22:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You mean the Trump Kids Estate Tax legislation? Any working person who believes this is for their benefit is also a brainless sheep.

920609607344463872 2017-10-18 11:16:49 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump No, disrespect looks like this: "He knew what he signed up for, but I guess it still hurts." You GUESS it still hurts? So unfit to be POTUS!
920401621187563520 2017-10-17 21:30:21 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill LOL. Some talented staff you have there who can't do basic background info for the boss. Or did you not read it @realDonaldTrump?

920279509529632768 2017-10-17 13:25:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill Give me a break, Sarah! He was his usual self, unable to do anything but attack others. When caught in another lie, he shows his unfitness.
920278511343898627 2017-10-17 13:21:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @KatyTurNBC Loving your book, Katy! My fav so far is the curling iron in Trump rally bathroom. It lifted my spirits through the rest of the insanity!!

920258520355717121 2017-10-17 12:01:43 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN How sad that @realDonaldTrump is the Liar in Chief? He disrespects the office & embarrasses all U.S. citizens every time he opens his mouth.

920025746512396290 2017-10-16 20:36:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump that's a fucking lie. to say president obama (or past presidents) didn't call the family members of soldiers KIA - he's a deranged animal."

918455610923827201 2017-10-12 12:37:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Your racism clouds your ability to govern. Attacks on inner cities and Puerto Rico on top of more threats to NFL players. #NeverMyPOTUS
918296506993491968 2017-10-11 02:05:23 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, all the Republicans I saw interviewed today who said your unfitness is the buzz of WA. Not fair to you, you mean!
918181456052043776 2017-10-11 18:28:12 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @CNN Beauty v the Beast. Intelligence v Clueless. Leader v Dictator. Feminist v Pussy Grabber. The contrasts could not be more stark!!
918180017107976192 2017-10-11 18:22:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump At what point is invoking Article 25 appropriate? You act like a dictator unstead of one of three EQUAL branches of government. Unfit!
917750013672828929 2017-10-10 13:53:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump No, you are a liddle man who embarrasses our country with every tweet! Good God, man, start acting like an effing POTUS or resign!!
917728410130038785 2017-10-10 12:27:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump No, we just don't like wasting $$ on useless things. Kind of like your PR stunt with the VP at the NFL game. Quit dividing Americans!!!
917727347742089216 2017-10-10 12:23:44 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You mean you'll be destroying the ACA and taking health care AWAY from people. You are the worst POTUS in US history!!!
917726025861050369 2017-10-10 12:18:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump I support your IQ test with Tillerson. We already know the result; but it will require proof for the doubtful sheep - long form, of course!!
917342553187352578 2017-10-09 10:54:42 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump "It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning." Still unsupervised?
917341985878319105 2017-10-09 10:52:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill It was all set up by @realDonaldTrump and @mike_pence did the stunt. Quit wasting my tax dollars are b.s. stunts!! 1st Amendment rules!
917201187958513669 2017-10-08 01:32:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SecondLady @VP @realDonaldTrump Another $250k trip at taxpayer expense to fly VP to pull a stunt like that. You Trumpers sure like to spend our money on those plane rides!
917200583500562432 2017-10-08 01:30:34 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump PaperTowelPOTUS hasn't done jack! Union Teamsters, Electricians and Nurses are rescuing PR - not you!
917200210882830336 2017-10-08 01:29:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Republicans fleeing racist party of Trump and speaking truth to power with no filter needed. U embarrass them every day!!
917020747385651200 2017-10-08 13:35:58 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Access Hollywood tape played over & over and you still want more coverage? 32% approval. 33,000 jobs lost in Sept. PaperTowelPOTUS. Own it!!
915917157174697985 2017-10-05 12:30:41 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Why are YOU doing nothing to protect US from Russia for the next election? 22 state voter files and you wait almost a year to inform? Nyet?
915916137484840960 2017-10-05 12:26:38 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You haven't been able to pass anything; so how could it be your doing? Still riding Obama's coattails and we all know it! #papertowelPOTUS
915556844587724801 2017-10-04 12:38:56 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump "Who does that? What planet is this man from? The Brawny Paper Towel guy would know better than to do that." U R N Embarrassment!
914836511572422657 2017-10-02 12:56:35 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump Love new poll numbers!! 56% of Americans believe Trump is not fit to serve as president." You are the only ingrate I see!
914121940515688448 2017-09-30 13:37:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Oh how I yearn for the days when US leadership was respected at home & abroad. Mueller, hurry the hell up!! MAGA, my ass!!
914121512101175296 2017-09-30 13:35:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump No, they are blaming YOU for being so obsessed with DIVIDING us on NFL that you totally ignored PR. A real leader admits when they blew it!!
914120462208077825 2017-09-30 13:31:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @HHSGov @POTUS @SecPriceMD First of many Trump swamp dwellers who thought we weren't paying attention. So happy to see your entitled butt gone! Next?
914119964470034432 2017-09-30 13:29:17 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Instead of acknowledging Trump Admin asleep at the wheel on PR, you attack the Mayor of San Juan? Racist POTUS you R the shame!!
913782873529843712 2017-09-29 15:09:48 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump #PriceMustGo I'm sick of rich hypocrites flying private jets at taxpayer expense. Our citizens in Puerto Rico could sure use that $$.
913514339377618944 2017-09-28 21:22:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @NFIDvaccines @SecPriceMD Apology NOT accepted. @realDonaldTrump should fire your butt for abusing taxpayer money. Does he have the guts?
913440786330542081 2017-09-28 16:30:29 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @thehill @realDonaldTrump How low can you go? You shame yourself over and over with your treatment of PR. THIS is your Katrina! Own it!!
913410368046632960 2017-09-28 14:29:36 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Took U long enough on Jones Act. Sad to see a POTUS listen to billionaire shipping magnates while PR suffered for it. This is YOUR Katrina!!
913009140800266240 2017-09-27 11:55:16 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump U will stop at nothing to divide this country. U are a draft dodger and not fit to be telling any of us what patriotism is. #FakePatriotism
913008592055189504 2017-09-27 11:53:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump LOL. You would be saying the same thing if your Strange guy had won. You have no allegiance to anyone other than yourself. #FakePatriotism
913007753244794880 2017-09-27 11:49:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Whine, whine, whine! You lost. You don't get to finally sign a bill. How about we try bi-partisan approach like hero John McCain said?
912772049617133568 2017-09-26 20:13:09 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @gzr3625 I like @HallieJackson reporting; but she totally whiffed on this interview. Be prepared next time!!
912771354822193152 2017-09-26 20:10:24 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How to fund your 1% tax breaks now that you can't steal the $$ from health care? Ding. Dong. Your Health Care was Wrong! Own your loss!!!!
912687962537713664 2017-09-26 14:39:01 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @HallieJackson Might I suggest interview with Sen Patty Murray, the Democrat negotiating bi-partisan h.c. You let RNC Chair spin lie, not once, but twice!!
912642619691245568 2017-09-26 11:38:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump You R a racial demagogue who has no problem with Nazi & Confederate flags; but black men taking a knee is disrespectful. Mueller, hurry up!!
912501693606010880 2017-09-25 02:18:51 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump So glad you're finally paying attention to Puerto Rico. It took you long enough and people are suffering!! #LamePOTUS
912501307239407617 2017-09-25 02:17:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Give it a rest! No Trumpcare for #DesperatePOTUS and no bill to sign. #HeroMcCain vs #BoneSpurPOTUS! Real heroes always beat the frauds!
912446024286740480 2017-09-25 22:37:39 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @lisamurkowski I pray that you will find the same moral answer to this health care proposal as @SenatorCollins & @SenJohnMcCain.https://twitter.com/hand_mcdaniel/status/912444059800682496
912444059800682496 2017-09-25 22:29:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SenatorCollins On behalf of my late sister who should be here celebrating her granddaughter, I Thank You from the bottom of my heart!!
912321372382040064 2017-09-25 14:22:19 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Bribery of four Senators to throw the rest of us under the bus is really something to be proud of. #DesperatePOTUS
912321071398871040 2017-09-25 14:21:08 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump How many confederate flags were also flying at the NASCAR races - in the stands, in the parking lot and flying from the backs of pickups?
912320326041616384 2017-09-25 14:18:10 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Show me YOUR patriotism by bringing every Trump manufacturing job to the US. It's called economic patriotism. Leaders lead, not incite!
912319641141223424 2017-09-25 14:15:27 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump "Who mandated patriotism? The Germans in the 1930s, they mandated patriotism. That's what we want to be?" - Jesse Ventura
912278879028469760 2017-09-25 11:33:28 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Wrong again. Patriots fought and died for our freedom - not the flag. Freedom of speech must have been important. It's #1.
912278321764765696 2017-09-25 11:31:15 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Because it's a fraud and a flawed proposal. You don't care what's in the bill. You just want to sign a bill, any bill. Sad Egomaniac POTUS!
912277187750805506 2017-09-25 11:26:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump POTUS should butt out and start focusing on things like the destruction of Puerto Rico. In case you missed it, they are Americans!!!
911935961428197382 2017-09-24 12:50:50 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @mosesbread72 Who's got your back? I've got your back! I'm a 60 year old white woman who supports #TakeAKneeNFL #NeverMyPOTUS #Proud12
911935275177086976 2017-09-24 12:48:07 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RSherman_25 Who's got your back? I've got your back!! I'm a 60 year old white woman who supports #TakeAKneeNFL #NeverMyPOTUS #Proud12
911922601869447168 2017-09-24 11:57:45 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump #TakeAKnee #RacistPOTUS As evidenced by the push back you have received, no one wonders who will win this game. #NeverMyPOTUS
911587715384098817 2017-09-23 13:47:02 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @RandPaul POTUS Trump says this morning that you're coming around to do what's best for the Party. How about what's best for the country? Don't cave!
911577411552133120 2017-09-23 13:06:05 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump John McCain is a hero, always has been. You, on the other hand, are a draft dodger not fit to be Commander in Chief. Stop bullying!!!!!!!!!
911576745064644608 2017-09-23 13:03:26 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Until January 2017, going to the WH was considered a great honor. Leave Curry alone you bully! He knows a racist when he sees one!
911362439110844416 2017-09-22 22:51:52 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @lisamurkowski  I pray you will hear the wise words of a brave American hero like @SenJohnMcCain and announce your opposition as well!https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/911290557191921664
911361964013608961 2017-09-22 22:49:59 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @SenJohnMcCain Thank You, Senator! I pray more Senators will hear your wise words and let the bi-partisan committee re-start in earnest!!
909411337578545152 2017-09-17 13:38:53 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump @Fuctupmind Grow up and start acting like a POTUS! Did you mention crowd size at your Mother Of All Rallies yesterday? You need a community organizer!
902897714098094080 2017-08-30 14:16:04 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump My nephew arrived in Texas yesterday morning. Instead of 5" heels, he wore combat boots! Guess which one I think is a hero. It's not you.
902895909528264705 2017-08-30 14:08:54 UTC <hand_mcdaniel> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, that Boeing federal tax rate of 3.2% is a job killer. So is that $8.7 billion tax break WA State gave them. Only suckers believe you!!
