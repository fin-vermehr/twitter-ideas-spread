831619237043171330 2017-02-14 21:40:51 UTC <MattieTheBest> Really disappointed that @BVB was denied that away goal. Unlike Barcelona, they deserved it. #MatchdayLive

829064941575487488 2017-02-07 20:31:00 UTC <MattieTheBest> I'm very saddened to hear about the passing of professor Hans Rosling. His ability to translate numbers and data to simpel words was unique.

828684177813942272 2017-02-06 19:17:58 UTC <MattieTheBest> Leicester is not the same team compared to last season. Don't think they're going down but they need to step up, soon. #IMOLIVE
828682760332181505 2017-02-06 19:12:20 UTC <MattieTheBest> I completely agree with Dean. It's a bit of a risk just benching Agero like that. #IMOLIVE

826154642430107649 2017-01-30 19:46:30 UTC <MattieTheBest> I don't think Klopp should be sacked for this. It's not just his fault. The whole team is underperforming massively. #IMOLive
826152899189293056 2017-01-30 19:39:35 UTC <MattieTheBest> I think that the FA Cup is still a place for upsets. It's a great way for the smaller clubs to gain experience and recognition. #IMOLIVE

821072269929775104 2017-01-16 19:10:58 UTC <MattieTheBest> Pep has a very certain way of managing a team and it doesn't work the same way in the PL compared to La Liga & Bundesliga #IMOLive

748966844602716160 2016-07-01 19:49:45 UTC <MattieTheBest> If Bale keeps testing the #BEL backline like this, the score won't remain 1-1 for long. #WALBEL

747390647661903872 2016-06-27 11:26:30 UTC <MattieTheBest> @sleepingatlast your cover of "Dark Horse" by @katyperry is on repeat atm #OBSESSEDpic.twitter.com/WteWEWs4x0
747389086856511488 2016-06-27 11:20:18 UTC <MattieTheBest> Already? I remember it like it was yesterday. Time really flies by. #proud #2YearsSince5SOSDebutAlbum
747308463185764353 2016-06-26 05:59:56 UTC <MattieTheBest> Can someone please explain to me why everyone's saying Messi will retire from international football? He's only 29 years old!! #ARGvCHI
747249522238185476 2016-06-26 02:05:43 UTC <MattieTheBest> I guess I'll have to wait a few hours before finding out who won this battle... #ARGvCHI
747249318902497280 2016-06-26 02:04:55 UTC <MattieTheBest> Okay. Extra time. Exactly what I didn't want. I really have to get some sleep.  #ARGvCHI
747248290723414016 2016-06-26 02:00:50 UTC <MattieTheBest> Holy guacamole  #ARGvCHI
747245314768265216 2016-06-26 01:49:00 UTC <MattieTheBest> I really don't want this game to go to ET. I've got an important meeting in the morning. #ARGvCHI
747243300621553664 2016-06-26 01:41:00 UTC <MattieTheBest> Did I say I was gonna go to sleep? Well, shiet  #ARGvCHI
747241081994100736 2016-06-26 01:32:11 UTC <MattieTheBest> I think I should go to bed while I'm still sane... Because this game is getting to me #ARGvCHI
747238841774379008 2016-06-26 01:23:17 UTC <MattieTheBest> And here we go again... But at least it was fair this time #ARGvCHI
747237414054289408 2016-06-26 01:17:37 UTC <MattieTheBest> Why am I watching this? I can't stand the ref anyway. I wish I could say "I'm out" but everyone knows that's not possible by now #ARGvCHI
747235333633417216 2016-06-26 01:09:21 UTC <MattieTheBest> Can someone give a red card to this referee?? Please??!! #ARGvCHI
747233330534428673 2016-06-26 01:01:23 UTC <MattieTheBest> This game has got so much to offer but sadly it's ruined by horrible refereeing  #ARGvCHI
747232375432749057 2016-06-26 00:57:35 UTC <MattieTheBest> This first half alone has been more intense and entertaining than all out the #EURO2016 games combined  #ARGvCHI
747231731841925120 2016-06-26 00:55:02 UTC <MattieTheBest> I think both sending offs were incorrect. Awful refereeing... #ARGvCHI
747166683308113920 2016-06-26 20:36:33 UTC <MattieTheBest> This is ridiculous! There's no stopping the Belgians! My father is loving life. #HUNBEL
747101036054216705 2016-06-26 16:15:42 UTC <MattieTheBest> Important save!! #GERSLO
747076187084693504 2016-06-26 14:36:57 UTC <MattieTheBest> What was that from the Irish defense? #FRAIRL
747074025600450561 2016-06-26 14:28:22 UTC <MattieTheBest> Griezmann aimed at Giroud for that horrible acting  #FRAIRL
747073446526525441 2016-06-26 14:26:04 UTC <MattieTheBest> Straight red!!  #FRAIRL
747072346574434304 2016-06-26 14:21:42 UTC <MattieTheBest> That's what I'm used to seeing from Griezmann!!  #FRAIRL
747071975718289408 2016-06-26 14:20:13 UTC <MattieTheBest> C'mon ref, are you blind?? How could that not be a corner? #FRAIRL
746819210031079424 2016-06-25 21:35:49 UTC <MattieTheBest> What I've learned from this game:1. Ronaldo has gone missing 2. The world is unfair 3. It's possible to fall asleep during a game #CROPOR
746818397585932289 2016-06-25 21:32:35 UTC <MattieTheBest> Vida with two chances just wide... God just didn't want him to score #CROPOR
746817855291789312 2016-06-25 21:30:26 UTC <MattieTheBest> Sometimes I just wish the world could be fair. Please bring me some justice! #CROPOR
746816891600125952 2016-06-25 21:26:36 UTC <MattieTheBest> ARE YOU EFFIN KIDDING ME?? #CROPOR

745694768110395392 2016-06-22 19:07:41 UTC <MattieTheBest> Did I just witness Sweden's first shot on target in this tournament? #euro2016 #swebel
745677894869999616 2016-06-22 18:00:38 UTC <MattieTheBest> I've never been so proud of another country's achievement! Moments like these makes me realize why I love this sport. #EURO2016

745643424695619585 2016-06-22 15:43:40 UTC <MattieTheBest> Un gran aplauso para un gran paso en la direccin correcta.  Vamos a continuar luchando por la paz del mundo.  #ElUltimoDiaDeLaGuerra
745394337182289920 2016-06-21 23:13:53 UTC <MattieTheBest> @jacksfilms I truly hope this will go just as horrible as it did last time
745359192974835712 2016-06-21 20:54:14 UTC <MattieTheBest> #Wales and #Croatia win their respective groups. God, I love football. #CROESP
745357382801317888 2016-06-21 20:47:02 UTC <MattieTheBest> I don't know weather to laugh or cry. This is insane, what this sport puts me through. #CROESP
745356782189617152 2016-06-21 20:44:39 UTC <MattieTheBest> What the heck was that??! #CROESP

745355996650934272 2016-06-21 20:41:32 UTC <MattieTheBest> Rakiti and Pique doing a bit of cuddling there. Cute.  #CROESP
745353724760068097 2016-06-21 20:32:30 UTC <MattieTheBest> I think there's a serious problem in the foundation of refereeing today... #CROESP
745342224079159297 2016-06-21 19:46:48 UTC <MattieTheBest> This is exactly what this game needed! Looking forward to the second half. #CROESP
745088959420727300 2016-06-20 03:00:25 UTC <MattieTheBest> It's currently 5am and I haven't slept a bit. I'm just lying in bed wide awake. #jetlag (yay)

743579282425864192 2016-06-16 23:01:30 UTC <MattieTheBest> This is the truth. Everyone should listen to it and take action. #MakeItStop http://apps.bostonglobe.com/graphics/2016/06/make-it-stop/

742001337714548738 2016-06-12 14:31:19 UTC <MattieTheBest> The woodwork is Croatia's biggest enemy today.  #TURCRO

741733838989209600 2016-06-11 20:48:22 UTC <MattieTheBest> That's what I was fearing... FT 1-1 #ENGRUS
741730553888702464 2016-06-11 20:35:19 UTC <MattieTheBest> Why is Roy bringing Wilshere on?? Is he begging for him to get injured so he won't have to use him again?? #EURO2016 #ENGRUS
741686716541571072 2016-06-11 17:41:07 UTC <MattieTheBest> I don't know why I'm laughing at that goal.  #EURO2016 #walsvk
741682301914996736 2016-06-11 17:23:35 UTC <MattieTheBest> Duda had been on the pitch for just 55 seconds when he scored the equalizing goal. #WALSVK

736680946678763520 2016-05-28 22:09:59 UTC <MattieTheBest> 1. Let the referee access the cameras for more accurate decisions. 2. Find a better way to decide who wins after extra time. #uclfinal
736672096005328896 2016-05-28 21:34:49 UTC <MattieTheBest> THIS IS DISGRACEFUL!!!! #uclfinal

736670372146380800 2016-05-28 21:27:58 UTC <MattieTheBest> I didn't want this... Now it's more about who has the luck on their side tonight than who plays the best.  #uclfinal
736668965825564674 2016-05-28 21:22:22 UTC <MattieTheBest> Pepe shouldn't even be on the pitch right now.  #uclfinal
736667918155583488 2016-05-28 21:18:12 UTC <MattieTheBest> I really don't want this to go to penalties. The suspense is killing me!  #uclfinal
736662381334532097 2016-05-28 20:56:12 UTC <MattieTheBest> Atleti deserves to win this but if they don't take their chances it will be hard. #uclfinal

735811175242469376 2016-05-26 12:33:49 UTC <MattieTheBest> One language is never enough. Un idioma nunca es suficiente. Ett sprk r aldrig tillrckligt. Ni leor teanga amhin.
735199734894370816 2016-05-24 20:04:10 UTC <MattieTheBest> @ColeSisco yeah I know. I just feel bad for him because he deserves to be a first team player and in this case his ignorance stops him.
