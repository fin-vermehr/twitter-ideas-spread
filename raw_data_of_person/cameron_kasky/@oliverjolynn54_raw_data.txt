971566665359151104 2018-03-07 02:01:58 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @se4realhinton My students are reading Tex now. They love it! 
971565477355978752 2018-03-07 01:57:15 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @DianeRavitch I will never carry a gun.

967763607227334656 2018-02-25 14:09:58 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @OWHnews @sdcoyote73 So do we stop trying to fight against the evil?
965780990961569792 2018-02-19 02:51:46 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @kali4change What do you need to do your work? How can my students and I help? Very proud of all of you.
965379723844030464 2018-02-18 00:17:16 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @MarkRicht Happy Birthday! 
961257583070842880 2018-02-07 15:17:21 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @bethhill2829 Having a student-centered classroom doesnt mean the students are in charge and its chaotic. Get input from students as you plan; give them voice and choice; let them discuss and share with each other and be in charge of their own behavior knowing there are consequences.
958796496484302848 2018-01-31 20:17:52 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @se4realhinton Would you ever consider adding Skyping with my class to your busy days?
956827478965747712 2018-01-26 09:53:42 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @se4realhinton do you ever Skype with students? My students would love to meet you.
955124607488577537 2018-01-21 17:07:06 UTC <oliverjolynn54> When I looked at the picture of you, I thought I recognized you. I sent you a message on Facebook, too.
955118937783619589 2018-01-21 16:44:34 UTC <oliverjolynn54> I wonder if I worked at the DCYC with you. I taught for EPIC.

954864399902265344 2018-01-20 23:53:08 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @MarkRicht So many of my students are fans, too.
954856969533313024 2018-01-20 23:23:36 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @MarkRicht Would I lie about something like that?  I remember when they moved to Florida but that was a long time ago.

880178347476701184 2017-06-28 21:37:25 UTC <oliverjolynn54> Horrible!
877969231572107264 2017-06-22 19:19:11 UTC <oliverjolynn54> I would put things like this on a different twitter address.
877969044921393153 2017-06-22 19:18:26 UTC <oliverjolynn54> If you want to do music videos or other things not part if your club, you could start a new twitter address.
877968858522333184 2017-06-22 19:17:42 UTC <oliverjolynn54> Since this site is for aviation, I would stick to that.
877940639370944512 2017-06-22 17:25:34 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @JennyMRobins @teresa_barberio @Lang_in_Contact Great picture! Sounds like all the planning paid off.

827174964952440838 2017-02-02 15:20:54 UTC <oliverjolynn54> sorry I didn't get back to you. I went to bed early. Glad you're going to the movie.
823022699702349832 2017-01-21 04:21:17 UTC <oliverjolynn54> I didn't know that. Thanks for sharing.
823022246029619200 2017-01-21 04:19:29 UTC <oliverjolynn54> I just may do that. My ex-husband was really into star gazing and he did it a lot. Our kids loved it.
823022059857055744 2017-01-21 04:18:44 UTC <oliverjolynn54> I'm not for violence at all. Violence begets violence.
823021554011426816 2017-01-21 04:16:44 UTC <oliverjolynn54> well we'll keep trying to learn together. 
823021268287062016 2017-01-21 04:15:36 UTC <oliverjolynn54> @OWHnews definitely not the solution . This teacher will not use violence with students. There are other ways to help solve the issues.
823019726456627200 2017-01-21 04:09:28 UTC <oliverjolynn54> I'm glad everyone was good and you had fun! Now I can be gone more!

821203436112900096 2017-01-16 03:52:11 UTC <oliverjolynn54> you were right!! What are you going to do with your day off?
821022021551263744 2017-01-16 15:51:18 UTC <oliverjolynn54> tragic!
820841817742737411 2017-01-15 03:55:14 UTC <oliverjolynn54> I didn't hear that yet. How very sad 
820812155733868544 2017-01-15 01:57:22 UTC <oliverjolynn54> it will be interesting to see what happens. I haven't been out at all today.

808833588275904513 2016-12-13 00:38:49 UTC <oliverjolynn54> I get that. You can understand the words and that makes a difference.
808832639276826625 2016-12-13 00:35:03 UTC <oliverjolynn54> yes. When I first heard it, I thought the same thing.
808832077198200832 2016-12-13 00:32:49 UTC <oliverjolynn54> yes, you're right. That's an oldie but a goodie!!

808129232069165056 2016-12-11 01:59:57 UTC <oliverjolynn54> it's the last week of classes next week us Review and semester tests. The last day is December 22nd.

807801226255548425 2016-12-10 04:16:35 UTC <oliverjolynn54> I hope so. Then we'll have project parties after school. Snacks, music and working on projects.
