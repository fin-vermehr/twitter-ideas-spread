963614407027720192 2018-02-13 03:22:32 UTC <lilsarg> @megansarahj Absolutely. But the @BostonGlobe needs to care as much about their own shit as they care about @WEEI's shit.
963611391486840834 2018-02-13 03:10:33 UTC <lilsarg> How about the @BostonGlobe cleans up its own issues before launching an all out campaign to call out other media outlets on their issues? Just saying. Glass houses.https://twitter.com/bostonglobe/status/963217424614031360

960307486535364608 2018-02-04 00:22:01 UTC <lilsarg> Getting approved for a mortgage in 8 minutes doesn't sound sketchy at all.

959192561104670720 2018-02-01 22:31:42 UTC <lilsarg> If you don't treat your colleagues who allege harassment and assault with the same respect as you treated the victims of abuse by the Catholic Church, then Spotlight was just a blip. It should be who you all are, through and through.
959192218933309440 2018-02-01 22:30:20 UTC <lilsarg> I also truly hope the powers that be will be smart and brave enough to tackle this problem head on. You know, Spotlight style.
959191765612990464 2018-02-01 22:28:32 UTC <lilsarg> I cannot stress enough how much I hope that women and men at the @BostonGlobe  - and elsewhere - will be brave enough to speak out when the situation warrants.
959191638261272576 2018-02-01 22:28:02 UTC <lilsarg> Here's hoping this new system will play an important role in changing a newsroom that has long resisted change. I wouldn't put any money on it, but I truly hope that times are changing. Even at the @BostonGlobe.
959191488755392515 2018-02-01 22:27:26 UTC <lilsarg> It is incredibly discouraging that the @BostonGlobe remains - as an institution - completely uninterested in the experiences of those whose tenure at the organization has ended.
959191377513992192 2018-02-01 22:26:59 UTC <lilsarg> The reporting system, which promises the option of anonymity, is hosted by the risk management firm @NATEXGLOBAL, and is  available via this link. https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/54719/index.html
959191226376482821 2018-02-01 22:26:23 UTC <lilsarg> Last week, an internal memo was sent by the @BostonGlobe Human Resources department (or what's left of it), announcing a new internal reporting system for allegations including sexual harassment.
959191041634193408 2018-02-01 22:25:39 UTC <lilsarg> @BostonGlobe In the almost two months since the @bostonglobe published this story, I have asked (time and time and time again), to detail my own experience privately to the powers that be. All the different powers that be. But the powers that be haven't responded.
959190879096463360 2018-02-01 22:25:01 UTC <lilsarg> I was critical of that story for a number of reasons. @BostonGlobe editor @GlobeMcGrory wrote an editors note addressing some - but absolutely not remotely all - of the issues with the story.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/12/21/note-globe-readers-about-our-sexual-harassment-coverage/jLMfhHidt4oPB8pbTcKOzO/amp.html
959190512178749440 2018-02-01 22:23:33 UTC <lilsarg> In December, the @BostonGlobe published a story, an incredibly disappointing and flawed attempt at examining the issue.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/12/08/media-including-globe-walk-fine-line-age-metoo/7StgSw0BwDzhra2v8xKw0O/amp.html
959190081495060480 2018-02-01 22:21:50 UTC <lilsarg> For personal reasons, I decided not to go on the record, but said I wanted the powers that be in Boston and specifically at the @BostonGlobe to understand the toxic environment that has long festered in the newsroom.
959189809062404099 2018-02-01 22:20:46 UTC <lilsarg> [THREAD ALERT]   Approximately two months ago, a @BostonGlobe reporter contacted me to say he had been tasked with writing about the newspaper's own issues with sexual harassment.
959181141663211521 2018-02-01 21:46:19 UTC <lilsarg> @AmazonHelp But I'm already on page 3

959178201477140480 2018-02-01 21:34:38 UTC <lilsarg> @amazon @DannyDeraney Sadly no. Came with some socks and some espresso mugs

959177555160064006 2018-02-01 21:32:04 UTC <lilsarg> @ChrisCaesar What? Don't try and start a fight. No.
959176892959133696 2018-02-01 21:29:26 UTC <lilsarg> @ChrisCaesar I didn't know a car could even be repaired for $80. Is it a bicycle?
959113564865916928 2018-02-01 17:17:47 UTC <lilsarg> @samgf Hi Sam! Can you follow for a DM?
958875009342197765 2018-01-31 01:29:51 UTC <lilsarg> @mrdeeds18 No comment on this one. I just can't
958776786170601472 2018-01-31 18:59:33 UTC <lilsarg> I have to admit. It's totally worth listening.https://twitter.com/kristincav/status/958764436617158657
958550455491145729 2018-01-30 04:00:12 UTC <lilsarg> Where you been @RickSantorum? What have you been up to?
958549707923578880 2018-01-30 03:57:14 UTC <lilsarg> Whoa Rick Santorum still exists
958538838821036033 2018-01-30 03:14:02 UTC <lilsarg> @brianTburns_ Obviously I'm VP and dash gets a cabinet position

958458806748483584 2018-01-30 21:56:01 UTC <lilsarg> Instead of watching the SOTU I'm going to a dinner of women who are fundraising to help early detection of ovarian cancer. Then I'm coming home to watch @inagarten on DVR.
958434804252446720 2018-01-30 20:20:38 UTC <lilsarg> @gurcanmeister Huh?
958429525053976578 2018-01-30 19:59:40 UTC <lilsarg> @JRHansen4 Pretty sure they're not aware
958423120582410241 2018-01-30 19:34:13 UTC <lilsarg> Pedestrians in Brookline have zero qualms when it comes to asserting themselves. Coolidge Corner is like some kind of lawless pedestrian-run hell.

958375579656577025 2018-01-30 16:25:18 UTC <lilsarg> @realDonaldTrump AND this piece @BertoScalese and I co-authored was republished in the premier magazine for Canadian snow management professionals.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.boston.com/weather/local-news/2014/11/13/the-definitive-guide-to-snow-removal-personality-types/amp
958375115040935936 2018-01-30 16:23:27 UTC <lilsarg> If you're doubting my credentials as an expert on snow removal, know that I even interviewed @realDonaldTrump on the subject back in 2015. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.boston.com/news/national-news/2015/02/10/donald-trump-on-snow-salt-vaccines-and-the-oval-office/amppic.twitter.com/k8DBuTMcQU

958107550158852098 2018-01-29 22:40:15 UTC <lilsarg> To be honest I can't play pool with a pool cue and a piece of rope.
958107039300976642 2018-01-29 22:38:13 UTC <lilsarg> "You can't play pool with a rope" is my new go-to expression.https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/958104749689266176

957384505395904512 2018-01-27 22:47:08 UTC <lilsarg> Oh Dan. Thanks for always reminding us what it means to be an enormous asshole.https://twitter.com/danbilzerian/status/957382211593945088
957275527651516416 2018-01-27 15:34:05 UTC <lilsarg> @caulkthewagon Yes
957274278680059905 2018-01-27 15:29:07 UTC <lilsarg> And I think complicity is putting it mildly.

957272169079279616 2018-01-27 15:20:45 UTC <lilsarg> @Trumpwatching1 I called it an "amazing gem" - how does that indicate outrage?
957272006822649860 2018-01-27 15:20:06 UTC <lilsarg> @Trumpwatching1 Taken aback? It's a great clock!!

956610117125976066 2018-01-25 19:29:59 UTC <lilsarg> @susantran @innyj10 That is fair. And all I've asked for is to share my experience privately.
956609633229135872 2018-01-25 19:28:04 UTC <lilsarg> @susantran I think it depends who you are. But -- safe to say The globe has its share of haters and loyalists.
956609146480222213 2018-01-25 19:26:08 UTC <lilsarg> @RandyLPhelps @RanqueBenoit Someday!
956608241424830464 2018-01-25 19:22:32 UTC <lilsarg> @brianTburns_ Indeed you do
956606020838723586 2018-01-25 19:13:42 UTC <lilsarg> @ejleven So proud of you! You're a superstah! (As @BertoScalese would say)
956605721973583872 2018-01-25 19:12:31 UTC <lilsarg> @RandyLPhelps I agree that we need to be very careful not to ruin anyone's life. I simply am suggesting that we seem to be more careful when it comes to protecting the lives of the accused than the lives of the victims
956599784051236865 2018-01-25 18:48:55 UTC <lilsarg> @BullMooseFuture Completely agree. I think women largely go public only when institutions don't respond.
956599054280069123 2018-01-25 18:46:01 UTC <lilsarg> The @BostonGlobe - which has declined my repeated offers to meet to discuss my own knowledge of rampant sexual harassment within their newsroom - just published this. http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2018/01/25/survivor-testimony-nassar-case-provides-lessons-for-institutional-leaders/U1uaxUIfxSrIG2zW2vjb2K/story.htmlpic.twitter.com/lW8yNw1PBP
956596953999138816 2018-01-25 18:37:41 UTC <lilsarg> Let one victim talk, freely, and you just might realize she is one of dozens. That's what we now know. Silence one victim, discourage one victim from speaking, and you may be silencing the rest.
956596653175263237 2018-01-25 18:36:29 UTC <lilsarg> @raschatz You get nassar by getting one victim. Then the rest emerge
956596375915040768 2018-01-25 18:35:23 UTC <lilsarg> Great story @ejleven! 
956595981503614976 2018-01-25 18:33:49 UTC <lilsarg> @bibliographing That's fair. I should have been more specific. I meant I hadn't heard a chorus of voices inside the @BostonGlobe saying so.
956595780672016384 2018-01-25 18:33:01 UTC <lilsarg> @raschatz I think there are a significant amount of women who don't think the men should be named
956595499364175873 2018-01-25 18:31:54 UTC <lilsarg> @RandyLPhelps Actually that's not the premise of the thread.
956595377221890048 2018-01-25 18:31:25 UTC <lilsarg> @raschatz Oh no I disagree. I don't think all men are like this at all. But some absolutely are. And others are clueless.
956595183222689792 2018-01-25 18:30:39 UTC <lilsarg> @Spacekatgal And all the other institutions that are still doing so.
956594822105661440 2018-01-25 18:29:12 UTC <lilsarg> @raschatz Well, it's easy to write about things you've dealt with!
956594397872877569 2018-01-25 18:27:31 UTC <lilsarg> @raschatz Thank you!
956594306785177600 2018-01-25 18:27:10 UTC <lilsarg> Wait you mean walking interns through a newsroom and telling them which known predators to steer clear of isn't a viable strategy???https://twitter.com/xevilbunnyx/status/956593932888141825
956592210627133440 2018-01-25 18:18:50 UTC <lilsarg> @Aloe9678 So many of these stories about men could be prevented by the men proactively reaching out to victims and acknowledging their misdeeds apologizing.
956591832909172736 2018-01-25 18:17:20 UTC <lilsarg> @StephenOkey Thank you!
956591202345914368 2018-01-25 18:14:49 UTC <lilsarg> @mcgboye It makes it a double standard.
956590355729862657 2018-01-25 18:11:28 UTC <lilsarg> @Aloe9678 It really is that simple. Truthfully you can do something appropriate ONCE, apologize and STILL BE OKAY
956589941319979008 2018-01-25 18:09:49 UTC <lilsarg> @mikemerc57 And?
956588981671677952 2018-01-25 18:06:00 UTC <lilsarg> @megruels In that case you wouldn't have known the names of the Boston Marathon bombers for more than two years
956588420649897984 2018-01-25 18:03:46 UTC <lilsarg> @TracyHonn !!!
956588347895500801 2018-01-25 18:03:29 UTC <lilsarg> Just because women don't gravitate toward you doesn't mean you have to take to Twitter and do this. There's a better path.https://twitter.com/ibrahimsapien__/status/956587865248555013

956587765671645185 2018-01-25 18:01:10 UTC <lilsarg> @IbrahimSapien__ Again, nothing is perfect. There are people who have spent decades in prison and been proven innocent. But when accused we still write the story.

956581920674066432 2018-01-25 17:37:56 UTC <lilsarg> @jacktemp Aw thanks!!! 
956580228331163654 2018-01-25 17:31:13 UTC <lilsarg> That's all. (The End.)
956580155257913344 2018-01-25 17:30:56 UTC <lilsarg> And before you remind me that the men accused of sexual misbehavior  haven't been arrested so it's different, I know it is. But when you repeatedly do the wrong thing, you can't argue it's unfair to be called out for it.
956579546643525633 2018-01-25 17:28:30 UTC <lilsarg> You're right. It's not fair that some predators are singled out and others aren't. Some bank robbers get caught and others don't. But, we still cover bank robberies, and we still publish mug shots.
956579181634248705 2018-01-25 17:27:03 UTC <lilsarg> If you're questioning whether it's okay for a victim to go public, given that doing so would potentially ruin the career of someone who sexually harassed or assaulted or consistently abused power, I think you need a gut check.
956578575368499200 2018-01-25 17:24:39 UTC <lilsarg> But -- Why don't we worry more about the careers he ruined along the way? Why don't we worry what could have been if he hadn't been allowed to do what he did?
956578435551375360 2018-01-25 17:24:06 UTC <lilsarg> "You realize he might never work again if you do this?" they say. "You realize he could be ruined?"
956578264050470913 2018-01-25 17:23:25 UTC <lilsarg> And yet, take a male journalist who has crossed the line again and again and again with the youngest of women, abused his power over and over, and we worry it's not fair to ruin his career.
956578178839048194 2018-01-25 17:23:04 UTC <lilsarg> I don't remember hearing a chorus of voices worrying about the lives of the individuals whose names and mugshots we published in the @BostonGlobe being ruined, reputations tarnished.
956578049125965825 2018-01-25 17:22:33 UTC <lilsarg> By the time the accused has their day in court, many news organizations have moved on. After all, you get more clicks on a story about a bank being robbed. Less so if the bank robber is acquitted a year later.
956577961947385856 2018-01-25 17:22:13 UTC <lilsarg> Every day, these same journalists work in news organizations that publish stories about people arrested for crimes. Often, they publish mug shots, include names. Not for those who've been convicted. Just accused.
956577792757587968 2018-01-25 17:21:32 UTC <lilsarg> "But these men accused of sexual misbehavior haven't been CONVICTED," I am told, time and time again.
956577618228367367 2018-01-25 17:20:51 UTC <lilsarg> But the driver knew he or she shouldn't drink. The shoplifter knew he or she shouldn't steal. The journalist knew not to plagiarize.
956577545515864064 2018-01-25 17:20:33 UTC <lilsarg> But the better question, I think, is whether it's justified. Not every drunk driver is caught. Not every shoplifter is arrested. Not every journalist who plagiarizes is caught.
956577455644561408 2018-01-25 17:20:12 UTC <lilsarg> And I don't really have a good answer. Is it fair? Well, I suppose in some ways yes, and in some ways no. Part of growing up, of being an adult, is coming to terms with the fact that life isn't fair.
956577358579986432 2018-01-25 17:19:49 UTC <lilsarg> [THREAD ALERT]  I keep hearing this same refrain: "Is it really fair to ruin someone's career to call them out for inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace?" Mostly, I hear it from journalists, both male and female.

956236762547965952 2018-01-24 18:46:24 UTC <lilsarg> And to those who wonder if sexual predators deserve to have their lives, reputations and careers ruined, I wonder if you think about whether their victims deserved the same.
956236409983131648 2018-01-24 18:45:00 UTC <lilsarg> And like you, the clock began ticking for them the day they crossed the line that was never remotely grey. Tick, tock, tick, tock. It must be maddening not to know if you're next.
956235955870019585 2018-01-24 18:43:12 UTC <lilsarg> Like you, Larry Nassar and Harvey Weinstein convinced themselves that those they preyed upon weren't victims - that Nassar and Weinstein were instead the victims.
956235688558645250 2018-01-24 18:42:08 UTC <lilsarg> Just because your acts didn't rise to the level of Harvey Weinstein or Larry Nassar doesn't mean you shouldn't - and won't - have your day of reckoning.
956235460963196929 2018-01-24 18:41:14 UTC <lilsarg> To the sex predators whose victims numbered less than those of Larry Nassar: You, too, deserve to be held accountable for the lives you forever changed.

954106284344713216 2018-01-18 21:40:39 UTC <lilsarg> The man sitting next to me on this flight is seriously STRUGGLING with his Sudoku and I can help but should I offer?
954074642620321792 2018-01-18 19:34:55 UTC <lilsarg> If @TVAshleigh is old, then I'm old, and being old means actually knowing things. And I'll take being old over being young and thinking I know things.

953336421229776897 2018-01-16 18:41:29 UTC <lilsarg> The torrent of #MeToo stories will stop when the behavior provoking them stops. No sooner. The women telling their stories are doing so because it's the only option they have other than remaining silent. There is no "good" option.
953332094377316352 2018-01-16 18:24:18 UTC <lilsarg> @AnnCoulter @cowbellguy19 It'll do

953330605697175552 2018-01-16 18:18:23 UTC <lilsarg> I'm so conflicted about @AnnCoulter. On the one hand, she's terrible. But on the other hand, I don't think she's funny.https://twitter.com/anncoulter/status/953114435962449920

952965835701792769 2018-01-15 18:08:55 UTC <lilsarg> @JD_Branson You think every country in Africa is a shithole?

952900552295436288 2018-01-15 13:49:30 UTC <lilsarg> I just made the mistake of looking at my Twitter drafts folder, and oh boy, some of you really owe me for my incredible self restraint.
952899913368653826 2018-01-15 13:46:58 UTC <lilsarg> @joshuarice Again, I don't see how either makes any more sense, unless of course you in part agree the countries are a bit shithole-ish
952899681012670464 2018-01-15 13:46:02 UTC <lilsarg> @arquimedezpozo I think he's saying that it makes sense to call these countries shitholes and that it doesn't make sense to call these countries crazy. I would argue neither makes sense
952897627439489024 2018-01-15 13:37:53 UTC <lilsarg> Why does describing these countries as "shitholes" make sense Dan?https://twitter.com/dankennedy_nu/status/952747006388326400
