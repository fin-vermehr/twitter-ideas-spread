972213288187650048 2018-03-09 20:51:25 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> Looking forward to hearing this young man from the Parkland School. He models good manners! Well done parents!https://twitter.com/kylekashuv/status/972201196336418818
972111675569688577 2018-03-09 14:07:39 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @willsommer @KyleKashuv What you truly see here is good manners rewarded/acknowledged vs the utter lack of in other very vocal, rude, disrespectful, dishonoring youth from that school. How dare you insinuate otherwise. Support his good behavior! #disrespectdiscouragedhttps://twitter.com/willsommer/status/971906346877640711
972109820995227648 2018-03-09 14:00:16 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @davidhogg111 @lauren_hoggs You have taken her comments out of context. Did you hear the entire speech?

971913542248091648 2018-03-08 01:00:20 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> David...what do you truly know about this? Apparently these are things you hear around the dinner table. The disrespect you show our President is alarming from someone of such youthful age. It will come back to hurt you many years from now. We reap what we sow. Consider your wayhttps://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/971892438603268098
971912077605572609 2018-03-08 00:54:31 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @realDonaldTrump @davidhogg111 #disrespectdiscouraged. It harms your cause. It harms you. Granny Bush 
971827886067015680 2018-03-08 19:19:58 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> I join my voice here! Leave off the snarky, rude, disrespectful, and totally inappropriate, childish remarks about Ms Loeschs family. Shameful. This does not help your cause!https://twitter.com/dloesch/status/971802590743756801
971827020958175232 2018-03-08 19:16:32 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @cameron_kasky Cameron...who is it that you think is against you? Please tell me. I want to know who doesnt care about our youth.
971609216640323584 2018-03-07 04:51:03 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> It was not peaceful. It was loud, disruptive and unlawful. Therefore they were arrested. If everyone who wants Congress to act on their behalf did this CHAOS will reign. Nothing would get done. Lawful proceedings produce order. Isnt that what you want? Order vs chaos?https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/971587845277306880
971606012158341120 2018-03-07 04:38:19 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> Have you had a world history class yet? Citizens in nations where guns were confiscated truly experienced their lives dwindling in what became totalitarian governments. The 2nd Amendment protects us from this happening here. NRA fights for that. Study history, Cameron.https://twitter.com/cameron_kasky/status/971025385935785984
971604165309976576 2018-03-07 04:30:59 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> This was peaceful-yes, no physical hostility. But it was anything but peaceful noise wise. The chanting was loud, and unrelenting. They also blocked his office door. It was an UNLAWFUL assembly. They did not have the legal right to do so, therefore they were arrested. I watched.https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/971582301686718464
971543534141665280 2018-03-07 00:30:03 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @sarahchad_ Sarah, this tweet reflects your navet. What youve said is not true. A day will come-trust Granny on this-that youll deeply regret these tweets as they also reflect a disrespectful attitude. One day youll be an adult trying to help teens-and you will reap what youve sown.
971541054649458688 2018-03-07 00:20:12 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @cameron_kasky Cameron, no one will ever force a teacher to be armed. No one is even suggesting this. As a retired teacher I encourage you to get back to your studies. Yes, youve gone through a horrific event. We know and care deeply. But your tweet reflects your young age. Let time mature you
971538573454430208 2018-03-07 00:10:20 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @BetsyDeVosED @lauren_hoggs Lauren, I understand youre disappointed but to publicly call out Mrs DeVos is very disrespectful. Surely youve been taught better manners. And no, your recent tragedy, as horrific as it was, is no excuse. Lets get back to schoolwork. Let time heal you. Granny Bush sends 
971449912054435843 2018-03-07 18:18:02 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @davidhogg111 @sarahchad_ #disrespectdiscouraged. Snarky rudeness is not attractive. You hinder your message being heard. Manners have power. Granny Bush loves you
971449282539769856 2018-03-07 18:15:32 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @davidhogg111 @sarahchad_ Lots of future potential here in you and the classmates who have chosen to side with your words & actions. Im very sad that one day these choices may come back to negatively impact you. I know you dont want to hear this, but you do not yet have wisdom that only comes with age.
971391280130543616 2018-03-07 14:25:03 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Put your faith & trust in Jesus. He sees. He has your best interest at heart. He will take care of you @davidhogg111
971389419570847744 2018-03-07 14:17:39 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> In this you greatly rejoice, though...you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These (trials) have come so that your faith (of greater worth than gold...) may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. @davidhogg111
971387732709793792 2018-03-07 14:10:57 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> But he (God) said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness....(Therefore) I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. For @davidhogg111 today
970839979214635008 2018-03-05 01:54:23 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> I think trade schools are awesome! ...so says a retired high school teacher. Senator Rubio is correct that choosing this education path should not be a consolation prize, rather a first choice for many of our youth...with pride! #EducationForAllhttps://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/970818178317275136
970817760778432512 2018-03-05 00:26:05 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> Granny Bush praying for you.

And He knows your deepest heart desires. Trust me! He alone can handle this! https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/970792550020927488
970815657636921347 2018-03-05 00:17:44 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> Hang in there Dana. Many appreciate your stand and very rational polite way of getting it across.

Lets get back in class and knuckle down to a normal life again. All this shall pass. I promise the issues will work out. But you need to heal in silence now https://twitter.com/sarahchad_/status/970666562746290176
970765709780320262 2018-03-05 20:59:15 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> Special folks!! Good parenting of children who know their manners and respect for elders. Solid!! This is what America needs.https://twitter.com/mattcbennett/status/970378313041633280
970014118152409088 2018-03-03 19:12:42 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> Young Master Hogg, drive north to Georgia and spend the rest of your Sat afternoon at my table. Fried chicken, green beans, squash casserole, slaw and cornbread. Granny Bush would love to see you rest and heal from your trauma. Ice cream for dessert!https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/969933386839019525
969932948278571010 2018-03-03 13:50:10 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> Respectfully, you can not possibly know what either President Trump's heart motives are...or what the millions of people in this nation, including me, are contemplating. Your overstatements will hinder many from listening to you. Heal first. Then contribute. https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/969930704652943360
969802913924177920 2018-03-02 05:13:27 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @davidhogg111 I watched this Snapchat. Lots of good things, but also lots of real disrespect. From someone old enough to be your grandmother I must tell you your message won't be heard through the disrespect. Encourage your friends to find the power of showing honor!https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/969666309200887808
969359401151795201 2018-03-01 23:51:05 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> Well done! It's takes a brave person to take responsibility for your words and actions...to to admit wrong when wrong and ask forgiveness!

969349164097265664 2018-03-01 23:10:25 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> Homework before Twitter simple as that. (Grammar not mine). Are you going to college? Hopefully your SAT scores allow you entry. Let's study! History? Political science? Law? Order the priorities appropriate for your age. Talking about the NRA is not one of them--yet!https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/969329843715309568

968950011840073729 2018-02-28 20:44:19 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> It's ok to feel bad about having sold the shooter a gun, but what you've said about "thoughts and prayers don't do anything"??? well, respectfully, you've just said God has no power. Are you really prepared to make that statement?https://twitter.com/BreitbartNews/status/968925269846380545
968948131416231937 2018-02-28 20:36:51 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @davidhogg111 Respectfully, there is a time & place for everything including the exercise of your 1st Amendment right to peaceful ASSEMBLY. During school hours you should be in class, listening to the teacher. You don't have the right to disrupt others from doing so. Try after school/weekends!
968901561886871552 2018-02-28 17:31:48 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> May truth prevail...and justice follow. There are consequences to our choice-making, either now or in eternity.  Better now. #truth #GodsWordhttps://twitter.com/JudicialWatch/status/968834923556679680

968857016071532545 2018-02-28 14:34:47 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> But Mark, answer this: WHY is this kid (with his kid's remarks) given so much press? Perhaps he should be called "puppet" vs "kid."

962392460910649345 2018-02-10 18:26:57 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @OfficialJimRohn @bmoore_20 Ironically it seems true that poor people all manage to have big TVs..and cellphones. This is true even in 3rd world nations. Libraries are left to institutions. I count myself privileged to have all three..and yet I'm not rich by any means. Just a matter of priority.

You have the support of many who want to see #AmericaGreatAgain I made my # a positive phrase as IT IS HAPPENING ALREADY! Many of us pray for you and your staff...and, of course, your family. May the Truth prevail.
962386422123630598 2018-02-10 18:02:57 UTC <FeliciaVealBush> @wyffnews4 All this synchronized stuff is a bit eery...reminds me of brainwashing where everything thinks the same...according to someone else's agenda. And not to mention it being obnoxious to everyone else there. Calling attention to themselves, reminds me of their leader. Sad
