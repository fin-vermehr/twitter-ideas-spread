971838558020521985 2018-03-08 20:02:22 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Ohhhh no. This does not sound good. Police were just here, they're interviewing everyone in the building about the father of the baby. Whether we'd seen anything, heard anything, when was the last time we saw him, etc.
971789179762958337 2018-03-08 16:46:10 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @peac4love @TinasMiky24 I would go sit under there and never, ever come out.  Well, unless someone had chocolate, then maybe I'd come out. Otherwise, no. LOL
971775237049155584 2018-03-08 15:50:45 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I guess maybe all I can do at this point is ask those of you reading this, if you pray, to please say some prayers for this family. Thanks Twitter fam 
971774756663029761 2018-03-08 15:48:51 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I hope the baby was resuscitated and is doing better.   I'm a nurse and am certified in infant/child cpr. I wish I'd heard something so I could've maybe helped until the ambulance got here. Or done something for them.
971773859392294912 2018-03-08 15:45:17 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Around lunch time yesterday, there was an ambulance, 9 police vehicles, an unmarked white pickup with emergency lights in the headlamps, the fire chief and a CSI here. The CSI was here for hours and even took photos of the family's car. All I know is the baby wasn't breathing.
971772994430304256 2018-03-08 15:41:51 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I can't concentrate this morning. I keep thinking about some neighbors in my building that may have lost their 8 mo old baby yesterday. I don't know them well, & have only spoken with them in passing. In fact, I only know their dog's name, their unit #, & that they have 3 kids.

970798166462357505 2018-03-05 23:08:14 UTC <Karmastrophic_> He is ripping Trump, saying SHS should "shut her mouth." Says Mueller team offered him immunity.

967815169651937280 2018-02-25 17:34:52 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile So long as it's a good faith report, meaning you felt threatened and unsafe, you're doing nothing unfair by reporting it.
967814813291286529 2018-02-25 17:33:27 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile It's ok, you're just trying to be fair, honest and I admire that in you. You've always been one to think about others, even when it's the person bullying you. That's what this is, it's next-level bullying. You need only worry about reporting it, LE will look into the facts of it.
967813448435470336 2018-02-25 17:28:01 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile Just give the responding officers the names of any witnesses, he or she will speak to them for their comments. If you do it beforehand, it looks like you're setting up a story and coaching ppl.
967811478274310145 2018-02-25 17:20:12 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile You might be saving someone's life down the road. Maybe your own. Or your roommate's son's.   Your neighbor sounds like a tragedy waiting to happen.
967811111830609927 2018-02-25 17:18:44 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile Think of it this way, by reporting it each time there's a threat made, the PD becomes aware of a pattern. Maybe he's threatened others, maybe he's on parole for assault, we don't know. But by reporting it, maybe it's the final piece LEAD was waiting for to be able to act.
967810217378500608 2018-02-25 17:15:11 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile Ok, promise? Tell them you're making a delayed report and you just want this documented. Part of why you want to do this is to establish a pattern. If he ends up hurting someone, a court is going to take police reports more seriously than a person's notes.
967809460025593856 2018-02-25 17:12:10 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile You're not taking him to court, you're just reporting he threatened you and you felt unsafe.
967809268803096577 2018-02-25 17:11:25 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile That's the officer's job, to sort that out.
967808992121708544 2018-02-25 17:10:19 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile Beyond just documenting, you need to make a police report every time he threatens you or your roommate, etc. Otherwise, in the future, he might not be held accountable because a judge or jury might say "but it wasn't reported to police, so no one must've been very concerned."
967808066610704394 2018-02-25 17:06:38 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile You can still call and make a report, so they have it documented. You've involved management, so you have that. It creates a paper trail. This way, if he really goes off the rails you won't have people doing nothing & saying "well, there weren't any police reports prior to this."
967806731718930432 2018-02-25 17:01:20 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile I didn't know about this! You really should make a police report, even if only just to get his recent threats on record.

966738559565750272 2018-02-22 18:16:48 UTC <Karmastrophic_> There are still mental institutions in the US, they're just more commonly known as "inpatient psychiatric facilities" now. I've worked in some.  What I'm concerned about is, who pays? It takes money to keep them open & if insurance doesn't want to cover mental health, then what?
966736413789220864 2018-02-22 18:08:16 UTC <Karmastrophic_> If someone is committed to an institution and cannot afford the cost, what happens then? Either SOMEONE (government?) pays or the patient is cut loose.
966735467948511233 2018-02-22 18:04:31 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump said today that we should be reopening mental institutions. The reason so many had been shuttered was because of the plethora of human rights abuses that went on in many of them.  That aside, who would pay for the care of patients? Many insurances will not.
966724354879913984 2018-02-22 17:20:21 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump was so afraid of being shot at & maybe dying that he dodged the draft 5 times. He couldn't handle the idea of being in a firefight.  But he's ok with CHILDREN being shot at, & expects teachers to do what he was too afraid to do - have to shoot an armed combatant.

966670975063543808 2018-02-22 13:48:14 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, I am politely and respectfully asking you to do something - go to Google and look at some of the medical photos of the damage and AR 15 does to the body. I warn you, those images are gory. Now think about the students of MSD, of Sandy Hook, etc. Children.
966668983314337792 2018-02-22 13:40:20 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump WRONG! An "average" school shooting doesn't last just 3 minutes, it's forever. The actual shooting might only continue for about 3 minutes, but it changes lives forever. A school shooting doesn't end when the gunfire stops.
966668172941283328 2018-02-22 13:37:06 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump Also, what you're describing is defensive action. A position of offense would be PROACTIVE, not REACTIVE. You need to ensure it's more difficult for potential shooters to obtain weapons, and make military style weapons unavailable to the general public.

Are you strong enough to look at their empty bedroom every day, knowing there's no reason they needed to die, that their death boils down to greed?
964146603463454720 2018-02-15 14:37:17 UTC <Karmastrophic_> So when WILL be the right time for common sense gun control @GOP? When you're planning a funeral for your own child?

963918770791215104 2018-02-14 23:31:58 UTC <Karmastrophic_> 17 dead, shooter used an AR-15.  But hey, at least the @NRA is making megabucks.  #GunControlNow #ParklandShooting
963917759972339713 2018-02-14 23:27:57 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @AGSchneiderman MSNBC is now reporting, per law enforcement, that 17 were killed in this shooting.
963855794868453377 2018-02-14 19:21:43 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @AliceInBanoi Thanks!  It could always be worse though. I could have something like cancer.
963848194609250304 2018-02-14 18:51:31 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Good news & bad news this am. I have bad allergies & asthma. Both could be improved by starting immunotherapy  (I'm already on oral & topical meds). My insurance will cover this at 80%, but only once my deductible is met & that's $2600 per calendar year.   I don't even have $26.
963836581521092608 2018-02-14 18:05:22 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Sometimes I read too much into peoples' word choices, but it jumped out at me that Pence said about Kelly "I look forward to working with him for many more months."  Months. Not "years"?   That just sounds odd to me.

963775243578900480 2018-02-14 14:01:38 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @ChrisJZullo We just got notice at work today that this tax act would cause some of us to have SMALLER paychecks starting with the next payday - which is in 2 days. No one knows whose checks will be smaller until it happens, or how much smaller our checks will be. Makes it hard to budget.

963610656858607617 2018-02-13 03:07:38 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @natespuewell I call bullshit. It wasn't "out of his own pocket." Seriously? If you had that kind of money, would you pay off a porn star for your boss or client, especially when that person has a history of not paying ppl back?
963609795168292864 2018-02-13 03:04:12 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I'm starting to wonder if this whole food stamp thing is another shiny object. Supposedly it's DOA, it's not going to happen...so, is there something else about to break that they're hoping we won't notice or pay much attention to?

963547836041359365 2018-02-13 22:58:00 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @JoyAnnReid What if they decide its too costly to deliver?  Imagine I have kids, little kids, and no car. Imagine the kids and I must walk to the Post Office to get our box - between 8am and 5pm on a weekday. It's 23 blocks away, and in North Dakota the wind chill can be -40 or worse.pic.twitter.com/RfGxa8Xc7G
963531514121216001 2018-02-13 21:53:09 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @kylegriffin1 @theRealUncleS If I were needing to pick up a box from my Post Office & had no car, I'd need to walk 23 blocks and get there before 5pm on a weekday. I live where we get -40.  If I needed to walk to a grocery store or convenience store, I have 4 within a 2 block radius & they're open 24/7.
963530564908220421 2018-02-13 21:49:22 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @kylegriffin1 @theRealUncleS Maybe, but then again - how many Post Office pick up windows are available in a smaller town or city & are they open 24/7? Versus how many grocers and convenience stores are within walking distance and open 24/7?

963445679820562434 2018-02-13 16:12:04 UTC <Karmastrophic_> You could spend the night at a hotel where there's an infestation and bring them home in your suitcase. She seemed to agree with that logic but still insists America never had bedbugs here until "we started letting everyone in."   *exasperated eye roll*
963444876619677696 2018-02-13 16:08:53 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I tried explaining to her that anyone can bring in bedbugs, no matter what country you're from or how clean you are, pointed out that ppl are getting them in movie theaters in AZ & that you can pick them up buying used furniture, but she didn't want to hear it.

952952425714987009 2018-01-15 17:15:37 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump My grandfather would not have been allowed in under a merit based system. He had a 3rd grade education, no money, did not speak English & arrived via chain migration. He shined shoes, cut hair, delivered ice & worked at a steel company.  Incidentally, he came here from Norway.

948982001268387840 2018-01-04 18:18:34 UTC <Karmastrophic_> White House bans personal cell phones, probably worried about being recorded. Apple watch with a $5 app is easier to conceal than a phone anyway.  Bonus, even if you get found out and they snag your watch there's an option to have the recordings sent directly to cloud storage.

This tweet says you'll be "back to work" today, the 26th, but you're out mucking around the golf course instead.  Taking a break over Christmas is fine, but don't lie to us and say you're working when it's obvious that's not what you're doing.

943394475354873856 2017-12-20 08:15:45 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @docjenDC @tirghrathoir Oh hey, that pic with daughter-wife Ivanka was during the family trip to Aspen when Donnie was still married to Ivana, his mistress Marla showed up & drama ensued, and Ivanka went missing only to be found later hiding in the closet of some random dude's hotel room. Good times.

943388292623618048 2017-12-19 07:51:10 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @lisamurkowski Yeah, this tax scam actually raises my taxes. I make under 27k a year and thanks to you and the rest of your people, I'll be paying $127 more. I know to you that's not much, but it's a month's worth of food for me.  Thanks.

943342315090923520 2017-12-19 04:48:29 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @POTUS @PressSec @tedlieu I compared what I paid in federal tax last year to what an online calculator estimates my federal tax will be under this GOP tax plan - I'll be paying $127 more. I know that doesn't sound like a lot but for someone earning less than $27k per year, it hurts.

943333044945063936 2017-12-19 04:11:38 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Huh. So I went back and looked at what I paid in federal taxes last year, and compared that with what Fox Business' Tax Cuts & Jobs Act calculator estimates I'll pay in federal taxes under this #GOPTaxScam.   My federal taxes will INCREASE by $127 under this new "plan."

This repeal is akin to allowing a business to charge someone in a wheelchair an extra fee for using the ramp.

The same goes for the Russian probe. If you're innocent, then let the evidence of that come forward. Stop blocking it. Prove it and then maybe ppl will move on.

However, before anyone assumes she dropped the suit because the allegations were false, do some reading on it. She was threatened, as was her family. Trump has connections via Sater to Russian mafia don Semion Mogilevich. Solntsevskaya.

938504271829569536 2017-12-06 20:23:49 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @HeathaT @waltshaub @JaneyTheSmall @mkalomiris The 2 handed thing almost makes a person wonder if there have already been previous TIAs that have resulted in some one-sided weakness.
938503769419145218 2017-12-06 20:21:49 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @HeathaT @waltshaub @JaneyTheSmall @mkalomiris I don't like the man at all, but I'm hoping it's not something like a stroke and if it is, I hope someone gets him to an ER immediately. Often TIAs are sentinel events warning of an impending major stroke. They might head that off with immediate treatment.
938500846773514241 2017-12-06 20:10:13 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @HeathaT @waltshaub Just for comparison, here's a woman who selfie-d herself experiencing a TIA after her doctor dismissed it as stress relatedhttps://youtu.be/SUzqLeC6XTQ

938497809686331393 2017-12-06 19:58:08 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @HeathaT @waltshaub @johnjec64 I'm thinking a TIA. As much as I can't stand this man, this makes me worried about his health. I hope someone close to him insists he see a doctor to check him out.
938497070352273408 2017-12-06 19:55:12 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @HeathaT @waltshaub @JaneyTheSmall @mkalomiris Does he have dentures? I thought he only had veneers/implants. Those wouldn't all come loose at once unless there was trauma. I'm leaning toward a TIA

936328544329793537 2017-11-30 20:18:15 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Now this tax scam will increase my tax liability by $1000 right off the bat, and to about $4000 by 2027.

890281288850173953 2017-07-26 18:42:54 UTC <Karmastrophic_> If nothing else, it made for interesting lunchtime reading. LOL
890280797508448257 2017-07-26 18:40:57 UTC <Karmastrophic_> around the same time Trump suddenly sunk $280 BILLION into Turnberry for renovations and the like.
890280675248615430 2017-07-26 18:40:28 UTC <Karmastrophic_> not much, other than the fact one of his Trump Turnberry directors was involved in it and...
890280266169757696 2017-07-26 18:38:50 UTC <Karmastrophic_> to a company in halvsies with Blackstone. To me, it stinks of laundered $$$. Maybe it's nothing, and what does it have to do with Trump?
890279961919188992 2017-07-26 18:37:38 UTC <Karmastrophic_> that this building was bought by the UAE royal family, sold to a co connected to the Sapir Org., then to Goldman Sachs, then...
890279510880514048 2017-07-26 18:35:50 UTC <Karmastrophic_> It seems RXR Realty is 50% owned by - THE BLACKSTONE GROUP. And we are familiar with that name. Anyway, I just thought it odd...
890279229564366848 2017-07-26 18:34:43 UTC <Karmastrophic_> The MTA is, of course, the state-controlled agency that manages the subway system, tunnels & bridges. But that's not what piqued my interest
890278975154552833 2017-07-26 18:33:42 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Scott Rechler is the former vice chair of the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, and was recently named to the MTA
890278408558706688 2017-07-26 18:31:27 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I'm not sure how much it sold for, but here's where I really got interested.  The CEO of RXR is a man named Scott Rechler.
890278077712011264 2017-07-26 18:30:08 UTC <Karmastrophic_> See, after Goldman Sachs bought the property, they also sold it on to someone else in 2015 - a company by the name of RXR Realty.
890277501142011904 2017-07-26 18:27:51 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Stacom also marketed properties for the Sapir Organization. Another familiar name, right? Get ready for another one...
890277264335806464 2017-07-26 18:26:55 UTC <Karmastrophic_> In between, however, it seems it was owen by a company called CBRE & marketed by their vice chair Darcy Stacom.
890276727062233088 2017-07-26 18:24:46 UTC <Karmastrophic_> It seems that Istithmar purchased the Helmsley Building in NY for $705mil in 2006, & resold it to Goldman Sachs in 2007 for over $1billion
890275374483025920 2017-07-26 18:19:24 UTC <Karmastrophic_> He's also CEO of a company called Istithmar World, owned by the royal family in Dubai...you know, where Trump just opened another golf crse
890274904549056512 2017-07-26 18:17:32 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I found a name associated with Trump Turnberry that I thought looked familiar: Hamza Ali Abdullatif Mustafa. He's one of the directors.
890274271582457860 2017-07-26 18:15:01 UTC <Karmastrophic_> So, instead of actually eating lunch on my break, I started Googling and found something interesting. Maybe means something, maybe not.

890187473338458112 2017-07-26 12:30:07 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @lisamurkowski @palee1960 @Im_ScottSummers @MissKathleen51 Yeah, I agree it sucks, I hate mine. At least it's capped under ACA. It can't be more than a set amount determined by state & family size

890063571522117634 2017-07-25 04:17:46 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @MrJonCryer @BillKristol And I thought I read that Schneiderman was working with Mueller. At any rate, they'd be needed for the $ laundering investigation. (More)
890063053819187202 2017-07-25 04:15:43 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @MrJonCryer @BillKristol I would not be surprised to learn Mueller has them. AG Schneiderman is investigating Trump's business deals re $ laundering (more)

890048622112501761 2017-07-25 03:18:22 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Sometimes you go down the wrong path and have to re-evaluate.  But the cure shouldn't be worse than the problem itself.
890048245292040192 2017-07-25 03:16:52 UTC <Karmastrophic_> What's the problem?  What's working?  What's not working?  What would improve it?  Develop a plan and decide how to implement it.
890047904165113856 2017-07-25 03:15:31 UTC <Karmastrophic_> and you sure as HELL do not throw out the whole works without any plan for going forward. Think of your ins like a dr would an illness:
890047495040102400 2017-07-25 03:13:53 UTC <Karmastrophic_> You invite feedback, find the balance, keep fine tuning. You don't total the car out because it has bad tires
890047413565652995 2017-07-25 03:13:34 UTC <Karmastrophic_> The goal is to find what works well for as close to everyone as possible. It'll take tweaking and adjustments, which involve LISTENING 2 ppl
890047188109340672 2017-07-25 03:12:40 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Obamacare isn't ideal. It doesn't work for everyone and the sad fact is NO plan will EVER be perfect. Someone will always have cvg problems
890047050775240705 2017-07-25 03:12:07 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Maternity care used to also be an extra policy. We don't want to go back to that. Ever.
890046951345008644 2017-07-25 03:11:44 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Is extra protection in most insurances. It covers the basics anyway, but if ACA is repealed? Not offering it unless you buy specific xtra
890046871921668096 2017-07-25 03:11:25 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Even still, you have to wait 6 months before coverage kicks in. Same with cancer. Plan for it and buy the rider because right now cancer cvg
890046686034354176 2017-07-25 03:10:40 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Well, damn, can your kidneys just wait for 6 months? Because if you didn't have that rider in place before it happened (usually 30+days)
890046584850976774 2017-07-25 03:10:16 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Oh, and when an emergent health condition strikes, your kidneys fail because you got food poisoning from e coli or something?
890046495822684160 2017-07-25 03:09:55 UTC <Karmastrophic_> an essential health benefit and repealing ACA means ins companies could require a rider for something like that. An additional premium.
890046306789543936 2017-07-25 03:09:10 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Just BASIC air transport is upwards of $24k, that's not including other costs like the staff and supplies. Or dialysis. That's considered
890046225747251201 2017-07-25 03:08:51 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Or, get this - emergency care such as ambulance transport. I process claims, I see those costs. God forbid you need air transport
890046139931774978 2017-07-25 03:08:30 UTC <Karmastrophic_> No longer required to offer anything. Another mandate Republicans want to axe -essential benefits. Things like dental care, medication,
890046050731520008 2017-07-25 03:08:09 UTC <Karmastrophic_> ACA also currently mandates that your employer offer ins if they have a certain number or more of employees. That mandate goes away too
890045963284492288 2017-07-25 03:07:48 UTC <Karmastrophic_> You think 20% or less of that total premium is expensive? How are you gonna handle 100%? Oh, and that's IF your employer continues to offer
890045851560796164 2017-07-25 03:07:21 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Obamacare has a mandate that requires your employer pays at least 80% of your premium. Repeal ACA and that mandate goes away

890037304349396993 2017-07-25 02:33:24 UTC <Karmastrophic_> You invite feedback, find the balance, keep fine tuning. You don't total the car out because it has bad tires
890037008164433922 2017-07-25 02:32:13 UTC <Karmastrophic_> The goal is to find what works well for as close to everyone as possible. It'll take tweaking and adjustments, which involve LISTENING
890036554722402304 2017-07-25 02:30:25 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Obamacare isn't ideal. It doesn't work for everyone and the sad fact is NO plan will EVER be perfect. Someone will always have problems
890035603898863616 2017-07-25 02:26:38 UTC <Karmastrophic_> My threading seems to have gone astray. Sorry, I was too mad, lol
890035303532154880 2017-07-25 02:25:27 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @snarrky Makes you want to scream, doesn't it?
890034284064636930 2017-07-25 02:21:24 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Maternity care used to also be an extra policy. We don't want to go back to that. Ever.
890033725148418048 2017-07-25 02:19:10 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Is extra protection in most insurances. It covers the basics anyway, but if ACA is repealed? Not offering it unless you buy specific xtra
890033311082569729 2017-07-25 02:17:32 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Well, then you have to wait 6 months before coverage kicks in. Same with cancer. Plan for it and buy the rider because right now cancer cvg
890033002411110400 2017-07-25 02:16:18 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Well, damn, can your kidneys just wait for 6 months? Because if you didn't have that rider in place before it happened (usually 30+days)
890032615041970178 2017-07-25 02:14:46 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Oh, and when an emergent health condition strikes, your kidneys fail because you got food poisoning from e coli or something?
890032206105726976 2017-07-25 02:13:08 UTC <Karmastrophic_> An essential health benefits and repealing ACA means ins companies could require a rider for something like that. An additional premium
890031888731176960 2017-07-25 02:11:52 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Just BASIC air transport is upwards of $24k, that's not including other costs like the staff and supplies. Or dialysis. That's considered
890031437436657664 2017-07-25 02:10:05 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Or, get this - emergency care such as ambulance transport. I process claims, I see those costs. God forbid you need air transport
890031051078340609 2017-07-25 02:08:33 UTC <Karmastrophic_> No longer required to offer anything. Another mandate Republicans want to axe -essential benefits. Things like dental care, medication,
890030676204040192 2017-07-25 02:07:03 UTC <Karmastrophic_> ACA also currently mandates that your employer offer ins if they have a certain number or more of employees. That mandate goes away too
890030235592380416 2017-07-25 02:05:18 UTC <Karmastrophic_> You think 20% or less of that total premium is expensive? How are you gonna handle 100%? Oh, and that's IF your employer continues to offer
890029856326660098 2017-07-25 02:03:48 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Obamacare has a mandate that requires your employer pays at least 80% of your premium. Repeal ACA and that mandate goes away
890029451442098177 2017-07-25 02:02:11 UTC <Karmastrophic_> They think repealing Obamacare doesn't affect them because they have employer sponsored coverage...key words "employer sponsored"

875357301556817920 2017-06-15 14:20:18 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump Stop fighting the investigation and let the chips fall where they may.
875357093481656320 2017-06-15 14:19:29 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump Admit what you've done, ask how you can make amends, then do that. Trying to keep up the charade must be horribly stressful. Let that go
875356705776967681 2017-06-15 14:17:56 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump If, as you say, you're innocent then you have no reason to obstruct the investigation. If you're not innocent, then salvage your reputation
875356338162991108 2017-06-15 14:16:29 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump They will protect themselves before they'll continue to protect you. You can help yourself by admitting to whatever you may have done
875355650741739521 2017-06-15 14:13:45 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump They aren't going to go to prison for you. Given the choice between many years behind bars or a reduced sentence, they're going to cooperate
875355298332061696 2017-06-15 14:12:21 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump The more you try to obstruct, the more you lie, the deeper hole you dig for yourself. Ppl are going to start talking
875354859817644032 2017-06-15 14:10:36 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump I'm honest trying to be helpful now. This investigation isn't fake news, it's not a witch hunt. They've got you.
875354441012191232 2017-06-15 14:08:56 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump I know I've posted angry, mean tweets to you before - as recent as last night. I'm sorry. I'm frustrated with what you're doing to America
875354033384542209 2017-06-15 14:07:19 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump A lot of the questions investigators ask - they've already got the answers, they're looking for a confession or to catch you in a lie
875353499076263936 2017-06-15 14:05:12 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump We can't make EVERYONE happy, but I guarantee you that more ppl will respect you if you own up to your mistakes and  be truthful.
875353116308365312 2017-06-15 14:03:40 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump There's no shame in mistakes, it's how we learn. No one expects you to be a saint or to be perfect, although someone will always judge you.
875352765349994497 2017-06-15 14:02:17 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump Stop lying, stop deflecting, stop blame-shifting and just take ownership of your behavior. Ppl make mistakes & you're no different
875352480342831104 2017-06-15 14:01:09 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump This post could now be evidence against you for obstruction. Mr. Trump, you're already trapped & the best thing you can do now is come clean
875351735090511872 2017-06-15 13:58:11 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump You need to stop. Seriously. You're not helping your case with these posts. In fact, this could be considered an "endeavor to influence"

874696324440084481 2017-06-13 18:33:49 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @haloefekti I know it sounds silly to some, but as a (lapsed) catholic, I believe in possibility of Bible prophecy & wondered if Trump is the antichrist
874694736975728640 2017-06-13 18:27:30 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDonaldTrump I can't wait until you're out, however it happens. I don't even care if you're held accountable, I just want you gone
874693016241532928 2017-06-13 18:20:40 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @Megs_Not_Here Thank you for the encouragement.   I'm not giving up. We can't.
874690855524761600 2017-06-13 18:12:05 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @Megs_Not_Here & I know that I have it better than many others. If I'm discouraged, I can only imagine that some must be even more so. I fight for them too
874690289214115840 2017-06-13 18:09:50 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Thank you @Megs_Not_Here. Giving up isn't in my DNA, but I am feeling really discouraged right now. Trump & his goons need to be stopped.
874688895602102274 2017-06-13 18:04:18 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @InxsyS Oh, context, lol! I was seeing your retweets and thought ppl were saying stuff to YOU. I was getting ready to start chewing on tweeps, lol
874687154273878016 2017-06-13 17:57:23 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I just don't know how to fight them.
874686900170362887 2017-06-13 17:56:22 UTC <Karmastrophic_> ...but I'll be damned if I let someone like Trump take it away from me.
874686660746805249 2017-06-13 17:55:25 UTC <Karmastrophic_> My life's not perfect, but most days I have everything I need. I'm okay with the fact I'm not rich, I have what I need to survive....
874684773528154112 2017-06-13 17:47:55 UTC <Karmastrophic_> But I don't know what to do here. I don't know how we fight this when it feels like no one's on our side.
874684543009206273 2017-06-13 17:47:00 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I did not regain my independence just to have this govt steal it away.
874684377661353984 2017-06-13 17:46:21 UTC <Karmastrophic_> At one point, I was so discouraged and overwhelmed I almost gave up. But I didnt, and learned to work around my impairments.
874683987796664321 2017-06-13 17:44:48 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Will anyone do anything? What can I do, when no one listens? My voice matters! I matter! My needs matter and my life matters!
874683509851533313 2017-06-13 17:42:54 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Why do ppl like me matter so little? Who will listen to us? Where are our leaders we look to for protection from corrupt govt?
874683166035935232 2017-06-13 17:41:32 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I work full time, I support myself without anyone's help. I don't spend money on stupid junk and I am responsible. I pay taxes.
874682772262182918 2017-06-13 17:39:58 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Trump & the GOP's greed could cause me to lose everything I have fought to obtain in the last 30 years, and I hate them for that.
874682410113302528 2017-06-13 17:38:32 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I will not be able to afford it. And without it, I could die from my allergies or asthma, from my bleeding disorder.
874682011767721984 2017-06-13 17:36:57 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I'm one paycheck away from homelessness  (as are many others.) If health insurance goes up or we lose protection for preexisting conditions
874681595696992256 2017-06-13 17:35:17 UTC <Karmastrophic_> But overall, I'm doing ok. I'm doing it on my own, and life has been improving. But, this presidency has me afraid I'm going to lose it all
874681268142788609 2017-06-13 17:33:59 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I've fought and cried and struggled to get where I am now. I barely make enough to meet living expenses & often go without food or things
874680909332721664 2017-06-13 17:32:34 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I've had to file bankruptcy, but I'm finally getting my life in balance. My job works with me and helps with my impairments.
874680515776958469 2017-06-13 17:31:00 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Because of these probs, I have had a lot of difficulty maintaining employment. Still, I don't qualify for any assistance.
874680099920113665 2017-06-13 17:29:21 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I continue to suffer effects: issues with short term memory, sustaining concentration & focus, anxiety, sleep issues, dizziness, headaches
874679588487614464 2017-06-13 17:27:19 UTC <Karmastrophic_> When I was 19, I was struck by a drunk driver who ran a red light at excessive speed. I suffered a mild traumatic brain injury.
874679269779283969 2017-06-13 17:26:03 UTC <Karmastrophic_> No one in power seems to want to stop this those who DO want to seem to be unable to do anything. How much worse will this get?
874678777149894657 2017-06-13 17:24:05 UTC <Karmastrophic_> As this mess has progressed, I've always believed someone with the power to do so would intervene and stop this freefall, but I'm scared now
874678430989783042 2017-06-13 17:22:43 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I'm officially scared now. I'm afraid for myself, and for the rest of America and what our future holds. This govt has gone insane.
874677938318442496 2017-06-13 17:20:45 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Since Twitter is really my only confidante, I need to unload. If you think my thread here would be helpful to someone else, go ahead & share

873656404766318593 2017-06-10 21:41:33 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Btw, if you should find this happens to you, keep emailing @support. Eventually, they DO respond, & they unlocked my acct & apologized.

872168970119512069 2017-06-06 19:11:01 UTC <Karmastrophic_> According to @PressSec, @realDonaldTrump's tweets ARE official statements. So this is an official threat by US president against a citizen.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/863007411132649473
872167267076890625 2017-06-06 19:04:15 UTC <Karmastrophic_> So, per @PressSec Sean Spicer, all of @realDonaldTrump's tweets can & should be considered official statements because "he's the president."

870274348711628801 2017-06-01 13:42:28 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @DeliaSkiby Most likely Bannon or Kushner using king orange's acct & they posted it to hype everyone up. Then they sat back & watched media freak out.
870273569791639552 2017-06-01 13:39:22 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @DeliaSkiby It could be some nefarious code word, but you'd think they'd use something other than twitter for something like that.
870273213217087488 2017-06-01 13:37:57 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @DeliaSkiby So, I think whomever posted it used Google translate to come up with that and thought it was correct. Not sure why though.
870272668632797185 2017-06-01 13:35:47 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @DeliaSkiby Evidently, it's a bad translation, "cov" should be sowfa, per posts I'm finding from actual arabic speakers. But, it translates via Google

870262707076857856 2017-06-01 12:56:12 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @DeliaSkiby I agree, or Kushner, he's sneaky too. Most likely Bannon though. 45 isn't smart enough to come up with it.

869999597917151232 2017-05-31 19:30:42 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @KevinDarryl @Laurabeffy *dons conspiracy theorist hat* The bombing happened within an hour of Trumps "covfefe" tweet, which Spicer said today was intentional typo

869994089399431168 2017-05-31 19:08:49 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Covfefe on the phone keypad is 2683333. I wonder if he got distracted, forgot he was writing a tweet, then tried calling someone?
869979207111233538 2017-05-31 18:09:41 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Trump must be planning a party in Vegas soon.https://twitter.com/cnni/status/869978537532510209

869977941173829633 2017-05-31 18:04:39 UTC <Karmastrophic_> No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, & reports are stating it's "unbelievable" the truck was able to get to where it was 7/x
869977196017979392 2017-05-31 18:01:41 UTC <Karmastrophic_> It would be a way of rubbing our faces in it, without us knowing what it means. An inside joke. What if it was a trigger word? 6/x
869976780794417167 2017-05-31 18:00:02 UTC <Karmastrophic_> And he gets to be a "wartime president."   Given his personality, it explains his f/u tweet asking if anyone knows what "covfefe" means 5/x
869976167121469440 2017-05-31 17:57:36 UTC <Karmastrophic_> It goes off near the German embassy, which might be icing on the cake for Trump. But it takes attn away from the Russia investigation 4/x
869975720977551361 2017-05-31 17:55:49 UTC <Karmastrophic_> It's just weird that Trump's weird "covfefe" tweet goes up & within an hour there's the bombing in Kabul. 3/x
869975296174379009 2017-05-31 17:54:08 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I wouldn't put anything past Trump. See, now he can justify sending more troops, more bombing. 2/x
869974762839199744 2017-05-31 17:52:01 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Ok, I know this makes me seem nutty...but is it possible our own govt was behind today's bombing in Kabul? 1/x

867376965208219653 2017-05-24 13:49:18 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @RedTRaccoon But then again, no one probably told be since I will likely never meet the Pope anyway.
867376492707274752 2017-05-24 13:47:25 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @RedTRaccoon I was raised Catholic & I didn't know you are to wear black with a veil to meet the Pope. Not saying it's untrue, just that I was unaware.

864638911850696705 2017-05-16 00:29:15 UTC <Karmastrophic_> How the repubs enable trump as he destroys the reputation of the WH, the presidency and America. How they do nothing to protect America.
864638448971460608 2017-05-16 00:27:25 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I hope ppl remember all of this next time they're at the polls - how dems are the ones holding town halls about Trumpcare while repubs hide

750002129104826368 2016-07-04 16:23:36 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile Not enough people are so caring. More often, ppl seem to  say "not my problem" and start flinging blame. That solves nothing.
750001005970923520 2016-07-04 16:19:08 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile Somebody maybe called the police on him. That was so nice of you to get him food though. You're a good, kind young man.
749730657320919040 2016-07-03 22:24:52 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I guess if I have to be alone for holidays, watching a marathon of my fave TV show with the dog while eating BLTs isn't such a bad thing.
749493950176645120 2016-07-02 06:44:17 UTC <Karmastrophic_> So, this is the second game to make me cry today.
749492564688908288 2016-07-02 06:38:46 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I'd read about it, and peoples' posts about playing it. Man, tough to watch some of this. I'm actually crying watching this video.
749491671079890944 2016-07-02 06:35:13 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Watching a Let's Play of That Dragon, Cancer. Wow, just...wow. I was doing other stuff at 1st & not paying attention. Now, I can't look away
749428816968241154 2016-07-02 02:25:28 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Dead by Daylight looks so fun. :(  *stands outside peering in through window, bemoaning current computer-less existence*
749428289102426112 2016-07-02 02:23:22 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Zyrtec, guiafsenen, cinnamon candies, a ton of water & tissues. Allergy season is in full swing. The post-nasal drip is driving me insane.
749403928513507328 2016-07-02 00:46:34 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Final ep of @bowlingotter & @LissySandwich playing Inside. This is one of the most disturbing  & morbidly fascinating things I've ever seen.
749386498697416706 2016-07-02 23:37:18 UTC <Karmastrophic_> But I'm trying to figure out what that yellowish thing in @LissySandwich's hand is that she's waving, lol.
749385479963811840 2016-07-02 23:33:15 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I'm loving this game! Watching @bowlingotter and @LissySandwich playing Inside. Kind of depressed I don't have a decent system at the moment
748979150082314240 2016-07-01 20:38:39 UTC <Karmastrophic_> *posts statuses* *replies to others' posts* *waits eagerly for responses that never come*  Yay, social media. -_-
748956929754406912 2016-07-01 19:10:21 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @LissySandwich and peeing. Burping and peeing. Good times. LOL
748946755157258240 2016-07-01 18:29:55 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Resident Evil: Apocalypse just started on SyFy Channel. My day just improved exponentially. It's always been one of my favorite movies.
748655685437521920 2016-06-30 23:13:19 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Baby don't hurt me. Don't hurt me no more.
748651172844572676 2016-06-30 22:55:23 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile I know, right? Picking on old ladies? Stupid gravity!
748650149782532096 2016-06-30 22:51:19 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Weebles wobble but they don't fall down.  Unfortunately, I am not a Weeble. And gravity's an a$$hole.
748236166344826880 2016-06-29 19:26:18 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Someone just retweeted a pic of a Momma cat trying to revive her dead kitten. I was already depressed, now I don't want to internet anymore.
747206338195841024 2016-06-26 23:14:08 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I overspiced my goulash. It's still delicious but it's making my nose run, lol
747206011090440192 2016-06-26 23:12:50 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @RayDayPlays Ha! :)
747205602334564352 2016-06-26 23:11:12 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile ah well. Someday I'll have another one. LOL
747205434461716480 2016-06-26 23:10:32 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @RayDayPlays and they're very shallow. No substance at all.
747205055078531072 2016-06-26 23:09:02 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile I would, but now I'm completely without a computer. Mine no longer recognizes the keyboard or internet adapter.
747145647195721728 2016-06-26 19:12:58 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Poor Merlin! I had the audacity to take the trash out to the dumpster abs NOT BRING HIM WITH ME! In a horrible person. Now he's pouting.
747130170180460544 2016-06-26 18:11:28 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile gotta eat 'em with some hummus. Probably wouldn't help though, but it tastes good, lol
746929508419153921 2016-06-25 04:54:06 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Who knew a cheap dollar store bottle of bubbles could be so much entertainment for my puppy? Bonus is that they smell like cotton candy. LOL
746891762120089600 2016-06-25 02:24:07 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile This is my envious face:  :(

741120463615692800 2016-06-09 04:11:02 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile We need these, lol http://www.boredpanda.com/portal-mirrors-the-kiromancer/
741041347243741184 2016-06-09 22:56:39 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Portal Mirrors!!  I need these!!! http://www.boredpanda.com/portal-mirrors-the-kiromancer/
740726664305332224 2016-06-08 02:06:13 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @LissySandwich it's pretty salty. It's good when used in scalloped potatoes though. I've put it in grilled cheese sandwiches too.
740048039646093312 2016-06-06 05:09:36 UTC <Karmastrophic_> My dog is flipping out. It's midnight and he's barreling around like a maniac, lol
740047726402932736 2016-06-06 05:08:22 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDTE @TuxedoVaile still though, I think it sounds like fun and if you do a lot of corrections you can earn about 800 USD per month
740047272407240705 2016-06-06 05:06:33 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDTE @TuxedoVaile and it's on Korean time so you'd have to commit to one of the two shifts offered. One would start around 10pm CST
740046975165308930 2016-06-06 05:05:22 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @realDTE @TuxedoVaile yes, you'd have to do a minimum number of corrections per shift, and commit to about 4 shifts a week.
739717206716514305 2016-06-06 07:15:00 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @bowlingotter that was one of those movies I meant to see then forgot about. Still haven't seen it but want to even more now.
739588335899807744 2016-06-05 22:42:54 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Back to work again tomorrow. My weekends aren't long enough!pic.twitter.com/Cml7XuOJ9v
739527257853558785 2016-06-05 18:40:12 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @LissySandwich This makes me feel less intimidated, @TuxedoVaile is going to teach me. I'm kind of excited to learn
739520119362060296 2016-06-05 18:11:50 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I wish they made these for adults too, lolhttps://twitter.com/striderite/status/732642954091712512
739511376893206529 2016-06-05 17:37:06 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @LissySandwich Congratulations! My son, @TuxedoVaile told me yesterday about your good news! That's so awesome! I'm so happy for you & Matt!
735918945799045120 2016-05-26 19:42:04 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile Thanks! It was time. I chopped my hair too, lolpic.twitter.com/4D2StjneVz
735812564223819776 2016-05-26 12:39:20 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile I don't tell you this nearly as often as I should - I'm proud of you. Not just of your accomplishments, but I'm proud of YOU!
735640580227629056 2016-05-25 01:15:56 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @YouTube @TuxedoVaile And I love it! I'm sorry I didn't reply here until now, don't go on Twitter much anymore. <3
723271209459290112 2016-04-21 22:04:28 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @Karmastrophic_  My childhood died today. I still can't wrap my head around it.
723264825422303233 2016-04-21 21:39:06 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Unreal.  RIP Prince.
722265077869453312 2016-04-18 03:26:28 UTC <Karmastrophic_> It is my opinion that people in upper floor apt units shouldn't be running on a treadmill at 10:30pm. Thankfully, he can't run forever, lol
716829454266343424 2016-04-03 03:27:14 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @Mirsthy true. Damn, this is going to be a long summer
716829148958711812 2016-04-03 03:26:01 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I guess not really a spoiler, people been discussing this episode's events for months. We all knew it was coming. Just hoping not Daryl.
716828646120357888 2016-04-03 03:24:01 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Spoiler alert....  I've a bad feeling we just lost Daryl. I figured Glenn or Daryl but there's no hysterical Maggie screams. :(  #whoisit
711732710197350400 2016-03-20 01:54:36 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Oh no, oh damn! Oh, man, no!  I liked her! - #TheWalkingDead
701603666625572864 2016-02-21 03:05:23 UTC <Karmastrophic_> *gigglesnort*  "Apocalypse & chill"  #TheWalkingDead
701595057481093120 2016-02-21 02:31:11 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Sriracha deviled eggs, cheesy garlic bread and The Walking Dead...life's good. :)
701215904579788800 2016-02-20 01:24:34 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I had my eye exam yesterday. My vision has deteriorated to the point I have to wear bifocals now. I feel old. Seriously considering Lasik.
700811276667080704 2016-02-19 22:36:43 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaile : Hideo Kojima Reunites With Norman Reedus and Guillermo del Toro http://epicstream.com/news/Metal-Gear-Solid-Creator-Hideo-Kojima-Reunites-With-Norman-Reedus-and-Guillermo-del-Toro
699059697488269312 2016-02-14 02:36:34 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Damn, Daryl! The new Walking Dead episode is off to an awesome start! Holy crap!
699035213251260417 2016-02-14 00:59:16 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I usually skip through ads on YouTube but the Steven Tyler Skittles portrait one was definitely worth watching, LOL
698647713491976192 2016-02-13 23:19:29 UTC <Karmastrophic_> My apologies to the rest of the building for making kimchi fried rice for supper. You can smell the kimchi down the entire hallway, LOL
698590730210533376 2016-02-13 19:33:03 UTC <Karmastrophic_> The gif of the dancing hulk, I mean.
698590345601220609 2016-02-13 19:31:32 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Bahahahaaaa! This made my day!https://twitter.com/EleenaFisher/status/698586491606409217
698589978389970944 2016-02-13 19:30:04 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Today's random thought: why is it that two FRIED eggs seems like a lot to eat, but two hard-boiled eggs seem like nothing?
698313911754293248 2016-02-12 01:13:05 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @KitoKeluc I once cranked the heat then took a nap. It was so hot when I woke up that it had melted a candy bar I had on the kitchen counter
698312996938887169 2016-02-12 01:09:27 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @RayDayPlays I found a nice little set of Asian style teacups with a serving tray though. Off-white with a bamboo leaf pattern. Really cute.
698312374579654657 2016-02-12 01:06:58 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @RayDayPlays lol, it was evidently just random rubble from at least 1 broken item, but why they just left the pieces there like that I dunno
698219451494236161 2016-02-12 18:57:44 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I found this disturbing little treasure while poking around a thrift store. No, I didn't buy it, lol.pic.twitter.com/KpBTmsyb8y
697431029603180544 2016-02-10 14:44:49 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Love this goofy, furry, battery-chewing, snuggly little creature. He's my little buddy. <3pic.twitter.com/dFksSp0Cxt
696882710741037056 2016-02-08 02:26:00 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @LissySandwich I thought of you right away when I saw it, lol
696854532102295552 2016-02-08 00:34:02 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @LissySandwich needs this for when she plays I Am Bread, lol. Something to rage-squeeze when frustrated: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ABVZX7M/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_emtUwb0Q4720F
694645199641837568 2016-02-02 22:14:56 UTC <Karmastrophic_> The kid's running, shrieking, & standing outside poeples' doors & barking because it gets Merlin & the other 2 dogs on this floor all crazy.
694644806794915841 2016-02-02 22:13:22 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Seriously. 3 adults in that apartment & not 1 of them noticed the 4 year old go out in the hall or can hear all the noise he's making?
693086884545716224 2016-01-29 15:02:44 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaileGame I hate the hassle too, that's why some years the tree is still up on Valentine's Day, lol
693083064277184513 2016-01-29 14:47:34 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaileGame Breathing, taking up space, those are my plans although at some point I need to put the Christmas decorations away.
693082701360812032 2016-01-29 14:46:07 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @RayDayPlays SPAAAAAAAAAAACE!  Makes me think of Wheatley from Portal 2, lol
692366380042207232 2016-01-27 15:19:43 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Merlin came through the battery-munching incident with no ill effects. :)pic.twitter.com/Ieqq8LfNye
691989516253462528 2016-01-26 14:22:11 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaileGame :(
691982400134352896 2016-01-26 13:53:55 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaileGame I know she didn't, but if she could I wouldn't be too surprised if she did it. He pesters her mercilessly most days.
691981913628618753 2016-01-26 13:51:59 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaileGame Either that, or Lille's sick of his crap & gave them to him. I did have some on the dresser in my room, which is gated off.
691973487905234944 2016-01-26 13:18:30 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @PixelaidPanda I have dreams like that too. The yelling one seemed so real I was sure I'd been awakened by an argument in the hall but nope.
691967937884753922 2016-01-26 12:56:27 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @PixelaidPanda I hope your dreams were just interesting weird and not scary weird.
691967785845420032 2016-01-26 12:55:50 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @PixelaidPanda I woke up all panicky because I thought they were right outside my door, but it was totally silent once I turned off my fan.
691967510707462144 2016-01-26 12:54:45 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @PixelaidPanda I had a freaky dream something wake me up about 3 this am. Thought there were a group of people shouting in the hallway.
691966218815668224 2016-01-26 12:49:37 UTC <Karmastrophic_> So far so good this morning. Merlin is eating & acting ok, no sores/redness in his mouth. Vet said after 12-24 hours he's out of the woods.
691896162228510720 2016-01-26 08:11:14 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaileGame  I have no clue where he found batteries. He didn't get them from a remote, they just magically appeared. He is aptly named
691878205632974848 2016-01-25 06:59:53 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @KitoKeluc Ooh, I'm wishing you good luck! I hope it all works out how you need it to. :)
691877746260205568 2016-01-25 06:58:03 UTC <Karmastrophic_> And so starts the snowball of "what ifs". Just reminds me how quickly things can go wrong if we aren't paying attention. Wake up call.
691876875904421888 2016-01-25 06:54:36 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I just had a horrifying thought: had Merlin swallowed that battery, I wouldn't have known a battery was even involved. He could've died.
691866177669300229 2016-01-25 06:12:05 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @KitoKeluc thanks! I was really scared for him. I'm glad the vet was willing to work with me so Merlin could get treated.
691864358691946497 2016-01-25 06:04:51 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @KitoKeluc Vet decided to do a payment plan & reduced fee. Merlin has meds and should be ok. Now I'm rechecking the apt for other hazards.
691841122197508096 2016-01-25 04:32:31 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @KitoKeluc yeah. I guess all I can do is give him milk, keep him comfortable and hope for the best.
691839450637287424 2016-01-25 04:25:53 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @KitoKeluc No dice so far.
691838662288474112 2016-01-25 04:22:45 UTC <Karmastrophic_> My puppy chewed up batteries. Vet won't do anything w/out up front payment & I have no money until next week. & they said it could be fatal.
691737827839647744 2016-01-25 21:42:04 UTC <Karmastrophic_> And the desk clock application keeps opening on its own.
691737725469200384 2016-01-25 21:41:40 UTC <Karmastrophic_> My phone's haunted. The charger cord is connected, but not plugged into an outlet. If I move the cord a little it beeps & indicates charging
691342061459640320 2016-01-24 19:29:26 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I don't get why some people choose to judge others by the size (or stereotype regarding the size) of their (cont) http://tl.gd/n_1so7p84
691316099678208000 2016-01-24 17:46:16 UTC <Karmastrophic_> For example, someone dramatically yanks their arm away and they repeat the scene over & over. Drilling it in - IMPORTANT MOMENT HERE!!!
691315340735721472 2016-01-24 17:43:15 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Have you noticed, when there's an important & dramatic moment in a kdrama they replay that moment about 10 times from different angles?
691294369941315584 2016-01-24 16:19:56 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Pretty easy on the eyes, this guy, and I love his hair, lolpic.twitter.com/ntBkZt6RYw
691292485302112257 2016-01-24 16:12:26 UTC <Karmastrophic_> I love Josean era settings in kdramas, & it seems a good number of them revolve around the legend of gumiho, which makes my heart happy. :)
691292082934194178 2016-01-24 16:10:50 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Now I'm watching Gu Family Book & I'm really enjoying it. I like Lee Seung Gi, & the actor playing his gumiho father is really handsome, lol
691291420901019648 2016-01-24 16:08:12 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Recently watched Gumiho: Tale of the Fox Child. It was pretty good, but dark & sad. I  liked it, even if some parts were a little hokey.
691288352054579200 2016-01-24 15:56:01 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaileGame maybe that's why Markiplier doesn't wear pants, lol. You've discovered his secret. XD
691057174915604480 2016-01-23 00:37:24 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaileGame yeah, it was all over me, I felt like a character from The Walking Dead. The poor girl standing there looking stunned
691025943062822912 2016-01-23 22:33:18 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @PixelaidPanda that's usually the same with me. Sometimes they poke and dig around, trying to find the vein. Then they try the other arm.

691025043120373760 2016-01-23 22:29:43 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @PixelaidPanda I'm tough to stick sometimes because my veins "roll", but the needle was already in. Just back-pressure was preventing return
691024652697739269 2016-01-23 22:28:10 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Shit happens. She was adjusting the needle and it popped out, no biggie. It startled me to see a blood fountain from my arm but I lived, lol
691024203303260160 2016-01-23 22:26:23 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Blood all over me, in my hair, all over the tech & the wall. Everyone keeps asking how I am but it's the tech I feel bad for, she was scared
691023723273543686 2016-01-23 22:24:28 UTC <Karmastrophic_> Well, this was exciting. Donating plasma at Biolife and the needle popped out during a return. Blood everywhere, the poor tech was freaked.

690006052901883904 2016-01-20 03:00:37 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @TuxedoVaileGame ikr? I heard it on a show I was watching and looked it up. It's sadly true, it would seem.
690005719836397568 2016-01-20 02:59:17 UTC <Karmastrophic_> @RayDayPlays I'm back! I got lost in the frozen food aisle. Sorry about that. :(
