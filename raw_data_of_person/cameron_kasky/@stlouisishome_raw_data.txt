777154822952722432 2016-09-17 14:38:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Thank you. "Hillary broke Libya" has been one of the most pernicious lies in this election. Collective amnesia strikes again...
776024832869675008 2016-09-14 11:48:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @Independent He looks pretty content.
775376731834228736 2016-09-12 16:53:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @dabearded0ne @RawStory They refuse to treat her like a human. It's infuriating.
774646369898274817 2016-09-10 16:31:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @chucktodd If it's damaging to her chances with racists, bigots, sexists... that's a risk I think she's willing to take.
774644265594990592 2016-09-10 16:22:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @maggieNYT @KevinMKruse One of the interesting things we've learned abt Trump is that he hasn't been able to ID ANY actual friends anywhere.
774028873319092224 2016-09-08 23:37:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @deadheadkat @AdamsFlaFan Next time she should express her policy positions through interpretive dance.
774017107629441024 2016-09-08 22:50:33 UTC <stlouisishome> How Hillary Clinton can get that 'presidential look' http://wpo.st/qk3x1
772887915202359296 2016-09-05 20:03:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @GovAbbott Actually it's about protecting the workers your policies screw on a daily basis. Your comment betrays your contempt for them.
770122287106367488 2016-08-28 04:53:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @DanaSchwartzzz @vibills Some people excel at this, sadly.
769328051247132672 2016-08-26 00:17:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @chrislhayes @KashannKilson Shockingly ignorant.
769221509139226624 2016-08-26 17:14:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @HawaiiDelilah @CNN & Every night they allow repubs to come on these shows and pretend calling out racism is as offensive as being racist.
769217669555814400 2016-08-26 16:59:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @CNN @HawaiiDelilah So many of these hosts are squeamish about calling anyone racist. If Trump isn't a racist, who the hell is?
769011652515786752 2016-08-25 03:20:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @Kasparov63 @megynkelly Laughable
765258468693454849 2016-08-15 18:46:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @davidmackau @ClistonBrown @ralphb47 So all that "Never Forget" rule only applies when trying to go to start a war with the wrong country.
765255209618595841 2016-08-15 18:33:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @ShandonTonry You know it. .. And the apathy/self-defeating cynicism of so many would-be Dem Texans makes it worse. We should be purple!

763836186234327040 2016-08-11 20:35:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @dailykos @AnonBruja Or maybe a giant mosquito net. And the mosquitos will pay for it!
763259209592868865 2016-08-09 06:22:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @HalloweenBlogs Well I hope the folks in Wisconsin are paying attention.
763251195402002432 2016-08-09 05:50:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @SpeakerRyan @HalloweenBlogs This is what passes for "leadership" in the Republican party?

763230438861082627 2016-08-09 04:28:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @ROB_NICH Eyes not on the prize.
763205824407756800 2016-08-09 02:50:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @Wilson__Valdez @mckaycoppins He's LYING just like his despicable nominee.
763201809250779136 2016-08-09 02:34:25 UTC <stlouisishome> @RussOnPolitics @dailykos Quite the opposite... hopefully the voters will see the light and send a second Democrat to the Senate.
763193178308550657 2016-08-09 02:00:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 They count on the fact that too many people in this country have an amazing ability to remember things that never happened.
763192187572002816 2016-08-09 01:56:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @SpeakerRyan @imillhiser His entire moral compass revolves around whether something is good for Repubs and hurts Dems. Soulless empty suit.
763182886476324868 2016-08-09 01:19:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @nytimes @scarylawyerguy They have been painfully timid in calling out Donald Trump.
763160717981659136 2016-08-09 23:51:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @RussOnPolitics @KatEdmiston @dailykos Nah, the only sins he cares about are ones committed against other Republicans.
763160131466952706 2016-08-09 23:48:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @dabearded0ne @ForecasterEnten @DaBearded0ne I can barely imagine another day of this insanity.
763022149783138304 2016-08-09 14:40:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @sahilkapur @washingtonpost Ah yes, the "silent majority" who can't STFU or win national elections.
763018386020327424 2016-08-09 14:25:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @samsteinhp @Jimmyspolitics @mmurraypolitics Anticipating massive legal fees?
762869856727207936 2016-08-08 04:35:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @SpeakerRyan @ViviVacca @NicholsUprising He's exposed as the unprincipled weasel he is. And can we stop pretending he's an intellectual?
762843487649697793 2016-08-08 02:50:35 UTC <stlouisishome> @AdamParkhomenko Is any state a battleground state anymore?

762469286078099457 2016-08-07 02:03:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @georgepbush @TUSK81 @NevilleLouann He took a big Trump on it.
762462259821940738 2016-08-07 01:35:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @SeanMcElwee The new season is pulling no punches. Really enjoying it.
762416136411488261 2016-08-07 22:32:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @Independent So I'll be citing the shit out of this.
762411796254777344 2016-08-07 22:15:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @MattGertz Yup.

762087148379971584 2016-08-06 00:45:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @Karoli Was wondering...
762032105245126656 2016-08-06 21:06:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @AHappierDay Thank you possums! Keep up the good work 
761782299838914561 2016-08-05 04:33:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @MMonides Georgia O'Keefe would be proud.
761442029784084480 2016-08-04 06:01:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @politico Oh yeah I'm sure it's all part of the plan.
761212106611929088 2016-08-04 14:48:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @harveyjkaye @_bhickman @NPR So "sheeple" may soon be a real thing.
760823666066141184 2016-08-03 13:04:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @Patztense @SenateGOP @SenWarren Nothing like a little political hostage-taking to start the day.
760816017874432000 2016-08-03 12:34:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @fmanjoo @washingtonpost It's like Chauncey Gardner and Mussolini had a big orange baby.
760802962234933248 2016-08-03 11:42:15 UTC <stlouisishome> @realDonaldTrump You are utterly failing in living color.

760604657831915520 2016-08-02 22:34:16 UTC <stlouisishome> Kershaw indicated he wasn't too pleased with his "act" last year so I figured he was already on thin ice.
760601604525436928 2016-08-02 22:22:08 UTC <stlouisishome> He bought his own hype and doesn't seem to take failure well. Shame for all his obvious talent...

760598401180327936 2016-08-02 22:09:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @kylegriffin1 @SethAbramovitch You can say (tweet?) that again!
760563616655433729 2016-08-02 19:51:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @elk_l The rest are just as crazy.
760429838301749248 2016-08-02 10:59:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @sahilkapur Ah yes, his longtime friends Harvey the Rabbit and Wilson the Islander. Soon to join him on the trail, I'm sure.
760325530302361600 2016-08-01 04:05:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @AdamParkhomenko @cherokeesher2 How cute, he's pretending he reads the Wall Street Journal.
760203223827230721 2016-08-01 19:59:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @petersagal Unregulated moonshine would explain A LOT.

759813941463650304 2016-07-31 18:12:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @brianstelter Trump should be glad for anything that might distract from Hillary publicly humiliating him live on national TV.

759808834026123265 2016-07-31 17:51:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Enough to make Orwell blush.
759804236125212674 2016-07-31 17:33:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @RawStory @TinaMcGugan Amazing what passes for aggressive journalism lately...
759797642498940928 2016-07-31 17:07:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @joshtpm @JD_Meadows Yup. Missourians aren't exactly liberal, but know crazy when they see it.
759566869644779520 2016-07-30 01:50:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @WeNeedHillary I do not believe the Show-Me State will vote for a heartless con man.

759234157142761478 2016-07-29 03:48:23 UTC <stlouisishome> @KXAN_News Yeah we don't need his kind of weird. Fuck him.
759227492402159616 2016-07-29 03:21:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnJHarwood @ananavarro @AndreaGw123 I think he'd burst into flames if he told the truth.

758115679308394496 2016-07-26 01:43:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @JesseLaGreca @GaryLegum Such melodrama. Good lord.

758103573477543936 2016-07-26 00:55:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @garypgarrett @NYDailyNews Don't let the door hit ya!
758102604677124097 2016-07-26 00:52:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @jbarro @realDonaldTrump If you say so Comrade Trump.
758038582170791936 2016-07-26 20:37:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @J_MoAGoGo @hhpapazian That... Doesn't make any sense.
758034364525522945 2016-07-26 20:20:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @J_MoAGoGo So.... Not true. She also sponsored a bill to improve subprime mortgage oversight. Called for more transparency.
758033404986167296 2016-07-26 20:17:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @J_MoAGoGo she voted to limit credit card interest. Voted against the law that made it harder to declare bankruptcy, against big banks.
758031491217526784 2016-07-26 20:09:25 UTC <stlouisishome> @J_MoAGoGo No, you're wrong that Hillary doesn't support addressing those problems. It's literally on her website.
758030554537136128 2016-07-26 20:05:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @J_MoAGoGo You're wrong but that doesn't matter. I don't have time to discuss issues with people who confuse cynicism with understanding.
758029940868603904 2016-07-26 20:03:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @J_MoAGoGo I didn't miss it. I paid attention to who caused it and who has righted the ship. I don't take 8 years of progress for granted.
758020495627292672 2016-07-26 19:25:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @J_MoAGoGo @hhpapazian Oooo that's so original. Yes how silly I am to appreciate political and economic stability. Go revolt somewhere else.
757818166525300736 2016-07-25 06:01:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @AskPlayStation Playstation Vue cut out and is giving me error message (um-ba50). What can I do?

757785993600638976 2016-07-25 03:53:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @MSNBC @CindyDPishere @antonia_simms yup! Discovered today at work 
757785654365265921 2016-07-25 03:52:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @MSNBC @CindyDPishere @antonia_simms They have literally only spoken to Bernie cultists! What a joke.
757785378090647556 2016-07-25 03:51:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @MSNBC @CindyDPishere @antonia_simms I was watching on YouTube but I made the mistake of switching once that concluded.
757781794959732736 2016-07-25 03:37:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @MSNBC @KPhed Bernie or busters sound so dumb when interviewed. Embarrassing.
757781643578839041 2016-07-25 03:36:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @MSNBC @KPhed Two in a row. This is fucking bullshit
757781054459486208 2016-07-25 03:34:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @GWBiscuit WTF is she talking about?
757778834066329600 2016-07-25 03:25:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @Matt_Didato Was just wondering the same thing...
757763627642331137 2016-07-25 02:25:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @Wisco @Rxbun @JodiSears Hahaha
757759154316378113 2016-07-25 02:07:15 UTC <stlouisishome> @CoryBooker @AlGiordano I got up and clapped!
757755247838146560 2016-07-25 01:51:44 UTC <stlouisishome> Short bench my ass! The Democratic party is stacked with smarts and decency. Republicans have granny starvers and bigots.
757694912951296000 2016-07-25 21:51:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @theintercept @Gus_802 Somehow I'm guessing what's good for the goose is not so good for the gander.

756972435438579712 2016-07-23 22:01:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @SparrowOnTheEye "The state of the union is tremendous, believe me folks!"

756970848834072576 2016-07-23 21:54:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @ron_fournier @HeyThatsMyPen @WillMcAvoyACN @jaketapper Not all feelings are based in fact. Why promote irrational fears over facts?

756850665004032001 2016-07-23 13:57:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @pmarca So... It seems Mike Pence was hired by RNC to be Donald Trump's babysitter.
756650566021881858 2016-07-22 00:42:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @timkaine @MO4Hillary @HillaryClinton I heard he is a  Mizzou grad? MIZ!
756499992693448704 2016-07-22 14:43:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @JonLemire I think we all know that's not a joke. Way to sell your soul, Mike!
756352807037382656 2016-07-21 04:58:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @mmfa Good. I'll dance at its funeral.
756351176971472898 2016-07-21 04:52:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @JoyAnnReid @sherrilee7 Loved that. Trump shamelessly uses his kids hoping the media will consider them "off limits" when they lie like rugs
756348569527853056 2016-07-21 04:42:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @JoyAnnReid She's so smart and  fearless. She puts all those around her to shame.

756026630150115328 2016-07-21 07:22:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @MaxBoot So basically... civil liberties are for pussies?
755706810711937024 2016-07-20 10:11:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @NewDay @CNN Why must he continue to insult everyone's intelligence? Only Trump's deluded minions could buy this bullshit.
755637648631398400 2016-07-19 05:37:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @jonlovett Facts are hidden in books. They'll never cross one.
755635368154820609 2016-07-19 05:28:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @7im It really upsets me when they take advantage of the Obamas' graciousness. The cowardly Trumps pick on people who can't/won't fight back
755598706921967616 2016-07-19 03:02:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @SarcasticRover Me too Mr. Rover. If Trump wins I may come stay with you for awhile.
755598129148243968 2016-07-19 03:00:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @Bobblespeak Smart people. Trump wouldn't know anything about it.
755584619903188992 2016-07-19 02:06:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @DanaHoule @dznyc So I guess there's a reason she is not a practicing lawyer.
755583341328379905 2016-07-19 02:01:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @DougBenson Then why does she have so many half siblings?
755582576392179713 2016-07-19 01:58:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @dandrezner @rhpatton Republicans are off the rails. They wish Obama was a failure like Bush. Can't face reality of his success so they lie.

751930176192163840 2016-07-09 00:04:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @BreastsR4babies @antonia_simms Indeed. It's absurd people have to think about this in a country that claims a monopoly on freedom.
751929621629636608 2016-07-09 00:02:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @antonia_simms @BreastsR4babies  I remember a witness in CO did that. Cops took his iPad and erased video he took, but it was backed up.
751928788175364096 2016-07-09 23:59:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @antonia_simms @BreastsR4babies I think so. You also check into having your videos auto upload to a cloud so cops can't tamper with evidence

751880102099640320 2016-07-09 20:46:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 @daveweigel If you're agreeing with Trump, shouldn't that be the first sign that something is wrong?
751857697834692608 2016-07-09 19:16:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @NYDailyNews @angeemathurin They probably tried, but the ugly keeps oozing through.

751813988145520641 2016-07-09 16:23:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @andygiarnella @PuestoLoco I'm convinced 90% of the supposed "women for Trump" on twitter are phonier than Donald's hair.
751812873928663040 2016-07-09 16:18:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @jonfavs @Marmel @CNN Inexcusable. Why don't they just get it over with and give David Duke his own show?
751245810159853568 2016-07-07 02:45:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @MattOswaltVA @mrosestl They also don't patrol wealthy neighborhoods like that because rich people don't pay tickets, they pay lawyers.
751243979094519809 2016-07-07 02:38:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @megynkelly @realdawnsummers @mmfa If she had any decency she'd invite her on and ask to her face. But she'd rather insinuate from a perch.
751234641575620612 2016-07-07 02:01:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @CountItsvan @Phaedrus08 @pari_passu I honestly have no interest in what that poisonous toad has to say.
750937122974994433 2016-07-06 06:18:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @goldietaylor @Bhamalpha @thedailybeast She knows the cop would lie if she didn't document the truth about her loved one's murder.
750933234641301504 2016-07-06 06:03:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @jkarsh @jsmooth995 This POS coward shot into a car with a child in the backseat. Fuck him forever.
750918679714336768 2016-07-06 05:05:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @WesleyLowery Devastating news. I'm so sorry. Hope Justice Dpt takes charge. Cops cannot be trusted to investigate themselves, only cover up
750906293242597376 2016-07-06 04:16:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @Debi129 @jkarsh Just saw it. Agonizing. I hope he can someday find comfort.
750703811061125121 2016-07-06 14:51:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @GOP @TheFreshBrew GOP is an intellectual wasteland. They are no longer having a discussion in good faith.
750703421607387138 2016-07-06 14:50:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @thefix @washingtonpost "Unprompted" my ass. How bout years of media and GOP  insinuating this over and over?
750701822608744449 2016-07-06 14:43:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @SpeakerRyan @TheFreshBrew Intellectual fraud. Plus he's so very unlikable. He will never ever be president.
750576014523297793 2016-07-05 06:24:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis Jesus and now white supremacists are feeling more emboldened with Trump speaking their language. I'm scared of the ugliness to come
750574293642272772 2016-07-05 06:17:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @BlakeDontCrack And absolutely never, ever attempt to exercise constitutional rights that white people take for granted.
750571671870967808 2016-07-05 06:06:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @beccarbarnett @nytimes Only cowardly racists defend murderous cops. Stay at home if you're so fucking scared.
750569904655462405 2016-07-05 05:59:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @nytimes Your callousness is scary. Your irrational fear of non-white people does not mean cops can murder at will. JFC.
750549096327417856 2016-07-05 04:37:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @Donna_West @NanoAged He beat Jane at Scrabble last night.
750548028679913473 2016-07-05 04:32:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @GlLLYWEED @nolifedevin Beautiful family. Thank you for sharing.
750545945599827969 2016-07-05 04:24:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @WAFB Bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit
750487983157972992 2016-07-05 00:34:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @JoyAnnReid Yes, he's managed full 360.
750359962497392641 2016-07-05 16:05:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @cherokeesher2 @HEINSLERJAN Right, and I'm sure they'd insist that any jury be composed of congressional Republicans.
750005960664489984 2016-07-04 16:38:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jay_Pums @SportsCenter This is a massive coup for Trader Joe's.
750004720761053184 2016-07-04 16:33:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @jteeDC @Nigel_Farage @UKIP He flatters himself. He was never a leader, just another civil arsonist.
749976592852455424 2016-07-04 14:42:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @realDonaldTrump @mrdavidwhitley @CharlesRowlands You know the birds and flowers are next...
749838374307897345 2016-07-03 05:32:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @themediaSux @JoyAnnReid Media seems ill-prepared to deal with moral issues. Trump's bigotry almost always discussed as political failure.
749779802723266560 2016-07-03 01:40:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @realJeffreyLord @IndieRevolver I'm guessing AOL is the only one he can spell.
749738561281208320 2016-07-03 22:56:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @paulwaldman1 @js_edit Guess that rules out my dark horse prediction, Huckabee.
749292446811467776 2016-07-02 17:23:35 UTC <stlouisishome> @TIME OMG wake me up when this fad is a long-forgotten punchline.
749291175966707712 2016-07-02 17:18:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @eclecticbrotha And convinced them they are more "enlightened" as a result. Tiring.
749290262254366720 2016-07-02 17:14:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @MikeMcCartney7 And their careers are short compared to most "jobs". They bring in the revenue, they should be paid!
749286819334721536 2016-07-02 17:01:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @Salon @sssmith0520 @TinaMcGugan Yep. I'm now suspicious of any news organization who hasn't had their credentials pulled by Trump.
749285662017277953 2016-07-02 16:56:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @Salon @sssmith0520 @TinaMcGugan Fear of upsetting the right wing base. They're fragile, erratic creatures.
749280271690715137 2016-07-02 16:35:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @McClatchyDC Give it a rest. She will not be indicted and it will not be "good news for John McCain"... or Donald Trump.
749273548485595137 2016-07-02 16:08:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @HEINSLERJAN @SenSanders So tired of GMO scare mongering. Seedless watermelon is A a GMO. SO SCARY!
749272286138474497 2016-07-02 16:03:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @barefootboomer @HEINSLERJAN Nope... Wouldn't want to upset his Klan base.
749271981644615680 2016-07-02 16:02:15 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill I hear Wagner.
748883412614733825 2016-07-01 14:18:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @WillMcAvoyACN @Variety @netflix @AlbertBrooks Thanks for the tip! Love all of Albert Brooks' movies.
747964498875604993 2016-06-28 01:26:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @SopanDeb @irishbride04 Good question...
747908220212023296 2016-06-28 21:43:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @jkfecke Ah yes... I forgot about that sweet Hillary shill money we're all definitely receiving.
747901253087170560 2016-06-28 21:15:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @jkfecke Somehow this fact has not penetrated the Bernie bubble. I mean, what's so wrong with at least *trying* regulation before banning?
747898578413117440 2016-06-28 21:04:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @jkfecke It also has run coal into the ground, no pun intended. I worry that banning fracking would just mean we'd go back to burning coal.
747800762890096643 2016-06-28 14:36:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @trcfwtt Haha good point!
747798905232908288 2016-06-28 14:28:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @trcfwtt Gee, maybe Congress should investigate Gowdy instead.
747153342338478080 2016-06-26 19:43:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @ABC And how many people are voting for him because they like that about him?
747101962198409216 2016-06-26 16:19:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @mmfa Let me guess... they determined that they are the real victims?
746925585776074752 2016-06-25 04:38:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @Twitter Put me down as a list-hater as well.
746856903620198400 2016-06-25 00:05:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @ferrifrump You are all truly Absolutely Fabulous! 
746847103125598208 2016-06-25 23:26:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis Disingenuously bringing up other people's tragedies is all the right wing can manage anymore.
746595087853858816 2016-06-24 06:45:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @rolling_2 If Britain can figure out how to export their insults they may just be OK after all.

746226471895588865 2016-06-23 06:20:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @beckynz @VABVOX I'm just low-key panicking here, telling myself lies about human nature.
746182801431498752 2016-06-23 03:26:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @GaryLegum Glib nihilists will be our ruin.
746096089292406784 2016-06-23 21:42:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @BuzzFeedAndrew Me neither. I wonder what his credit score is?
746073972714790912 2016-06-23 20:14:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @BuzzFeedAndrew Hey it's probably a better investment than a Trump property at this point.
745814559198306304 2016-06-22 03:03:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @BuffyBlogs Yes! This seems so obvious and makes way too much sense.
745814017956974592 2016-06-22 03:01:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @GOP @Karoli @BuffyBlogs They should have to use their piles of NRA money to pay for the funerals of those killed by guns.
745143656974188544 2016-06-20 06:37:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @erikhinton @derekwillis What a shame... I used to go to lunch there and enjoy the view from the top. Wouldn't step foot in there anymore.

744942720523788289 2016-06-20 17:19:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @DanaHoule I mean, it's not like Lewandowski is known for vindictive retaliation or anything.
744908643821203457 2016-06-20 15:03:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @DanaHoule Please let it be Don King.

743245538477244416 2016-06-15 00:55:19 UTC <stlouisishome> Somehow they still manage to breed more morons.

742929682010542080 2016-06-14 04:00:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @aravosis He is an amoral psychopath, so he just assumes everyone else is too.

742906696561876992 2016-06-14 02:28:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @JYSexton Sickening disgrace.
742801639086530560 2016-06-14 19:31:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @JM_Ashby @PAWarnhoff Or they shouldn't have let all those black folks vote cuz it skews his numbers.

742374756532424704 2016-06-13 15:15:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @ThisWeekABC @ABCPolitics @AliABCNews Will this moment of silence be scheduled in between their 3 martini lunches with NRA lobbyists?
742374153286619138 2016-06-13 15:12:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @AliABCNews @ThisWeekABC Are they then gonna vote for laws that protect LGBTQ people and regulate weapons of carnage?
742372379691651072 2016-06-13 15:05:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @benfelder_okc @mattdpearce Make them a fully protected class.
742368979973341184 2016-06-13 14:52:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @ananavarro Thank you Ana. We cannot allow people to deny the truth because of their own prejudice. Wrong on all levels.
742218057636970496 2016-06-12 04:52:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @LauraHarrisWFTS @coreybking Disturbing and too painful to imagine.

742158664778145792 2016-06-12 00:56:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @GregAbbott_TX @Wisco It would be nice. But we know he won't denounce himself.

742140616163790848 2016-06-12 23:44:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @nytopinion Only a cowardly bigot would refuse to acknowledge obvious bigotry. This is shameful and unacceptable.
742138125267304448 2016-06-12 23:34:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @VABVOX @Bywatergal @nytimes Infuriating. Those of us who can speak, must. Erasing them is bigotry.

742120168248086529 2016-06-12 22:23:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @FLGovScott @GregAbbott_TX You lack the decency to acknowledge the hate crime against LGBTQ human beings because you are bigots. We know.
742112875980820480 2016-06-12 21:54:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @PuestoLoco @RawStory He had this creepy shit-eating grin on his face during that press conference. It was weird.

741745368090607616 2016-06-11 21:34:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @sherry4201 Tired of CNN having the Trump and Bernie people on to repeat lies about Hillary without rebuttal.
741738192437547009 2016-06-11 21:05:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @meridithmcgraw @MWJ1231 Jebba? I don't get it.
741737825779879937 2016-06-11 21:04:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @Amy_Siskind @dilemmv @VFHIVE Smart and tough are always cool in my book 
741735774672977920 2016-06-11 20:56:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @mollyesque @JD_Meadows I gotcha.
741732966938738688 2016-06-11 20:44:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @Lib_Librarian @shaqbrewster The flag should file charges.
741730290435923973 2016-06-11 20:34:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @mollyesque @JD_Meadows Well it's probably hard to give Trump quotes context since he just bounces from one non-sequitur to the next.
741728231653416961 2016-06-11 20:26:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @TPM I'm starting to think he may have been lying about his brain.
741725904573890560 2016-06-11 20:16:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Austin on any given Saturday night...
741720783467085824 2016-06-11 19:56:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @KatyTurNBC @pbump Dude is not right.
741719777031294977 2016-06-11 19:52:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @Stanford @FresnoBee @nandelabra They thought the law was for "other people." So sad she can't decorate her shithole sociopath den. Fuck her
741711120616939520 2016-06-11 19:18:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @Mediaite Spot on!
741680800479879169 2016-06-11 17:17:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @MattMurph24 @teddyschleifer He's only cared about maintaining the appearance of decency.
741666964582469634 2016-06-11 16:22:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 See DM... :)
741666542618828800 2016-06-11 16:20:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 I think it lifts some out of poverty but it's not everyone. If a family has serious debt or high COL, it's still a struggle.
741664516434337792 2016-06-11 16:12:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 Unfortunately I think a lot of the issues are societal and probably can't be fixed with any particular policy.
741662476199153665 2016-06-11 16:04:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 I've always been curious about a proportional wage structure instead of strict min wage. I.E. setting a ratio from CEO down.
741661860114505728 2016-06-11 16:02:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 The simplest answer is an increase in wages. The unemployment rate keeps diving but those jobs need to pay more...
741660714490679297 2016-06-11 15:57:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 And I think as liberals we should be focusing on those with the greatest needs first.
741660432184676353 2016-06-11 15:56:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 Not entirely, but I think it's one of the more urgent needs since long-term poverty creates such a vicious cycle.
741660020056543232 2016-06-11 15:55:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 1st, "Right to work" and "at will employment laws" are awful. They create a workforce under intimidation. Work to repeal.
741656717771956224 2016-06-11 15:41:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 Leveling the playing field so all people can leverage the value of their labor. And womens labor is consistently undervalued
741656318105133056 2016-06-11 15:40:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 Health insurance as well... since women and children tend to need and seek medical care more.
741656172306923520 2016-06-11 15:39:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 I'd say programs like WIC and SNAP that Rs demonize, but we recognize as a temporary aid out of poverty.
741653268107956224 2016-06-11 15:28:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @Jess4Hillary16 I think the foundation of liberalism is empathy. Also, the humility to be thankful for our blessings & help others in need.
741648189837582336 2016-06-11 15:08:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @JSavoly @dailykos A solution to daddy issues?
741593361685970944 2016-06-11 11:30:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @realDonaldTrump @smahaskey As if it wasn't already obvious he is running to be president of the Confederacy.
741590563149873152 2016-06-11 11:19:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @realDonaldTrump @politico @bobbychaconjr1 So you admit you read Gateway Pundit. Say no more. Bye!
741518861820825601 2016-06-10 06:34:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @BJHare This photo can be prescribed as an appetite suppressant.
741511940871098368 2016-06-10 06:06:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @nytimes There go the unicorns.
741510655681798144 2016-06-10 06:01:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @realDonaldTrump @politico He'll be sweating through his bronzer by July.
741507720218431489 2016-06-10 05:49:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @Amy_Siskind @NYTnickc Is Mitch going to put his rally-goers on a script too?
741502490235936769 2016-06-10 05:29:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @fastny Bravo!
741498930903416832 2016-06-10 05:14:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @_barretme I'm already practicing my potato peeling skills.
741498763768823808 2016-06-10 05:14:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @_barretme That explains the cartoonishly long ties too.
741497529569673223 2016-06-10 05:09:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @_barretme Haha! He likes those dainty caviar utensils 'cause they make his hands look almost normal.
741496527412035584 2016-06-10 05:05:23 UTC <stlouisishome> @alanhe @SopanDeb @_barretme He'd do airplane foods jokes but he's never flown commercial.
741442130376163329 2016-06-10 01:29:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @SopanDeb Has this moron ever spoken a complete sentence?

741373553463812098 2016-06-10 20:56:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @sendavidperdue @feistybunnygirl It is an insult to our intelligence to even suggest he is joking. Sen Perdue is the only joke in this story
741367206781427713 2016-06-10 20:31:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @ThePlumLineGS He's trying to pretend he has principles. We all know the truth Mitch.
741334477859753984 2016-06-10 18:21:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @sallykohn @Jdgbert They have a hard time managing human-like.
741324845032476677 2016-06-10 17:43:10 UTC <stlouisishome> Trump doesnt have a national campaign. So the GOP is trying to run one for him. http://wpo.st/ccke1
741277954567589888 2016-06-10 14:36:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @woodruffbets I hope Sen. Perdue's days are long and miserable.
741269905790488576 2016-06-10 14:04:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @HEINSLERJAN They need deprogramming.
741110699036794880 2016-06-09 03:32:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @TUSK81 @josephebacon It's seriously a dream come true. We won't let Repubs define us anymore.
740992763685019649 2016-06-09 19:43:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @BySteveReilly Since he refuses to release his taxes, can we at least run a credit check on him?
740916487293046784 2016-06-09 14:40:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @JoyAnnReid Send him to the poor house, not the white house.
740564187298992129 2016-06-08 15:20:35 UTC <stlouisishome> Well obviously. Everyone knows the DNC controls all aspects of public life.
740563358546460673 2016-06-08 15:17:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @CNNPolitics @LoriSums He should start with acting human.
740562543370850304 2016-06-08 15:14:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @ByronTau Is this going to be where he releases his tax returns?
740559697015504898 2016-06-08 15:02:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @OnPointRadio I swear it's as if people want Hillary and her supporters to apologize for winning. We will not. We are celebrating heartily.
740549829609193472 2016-06-08 14:23:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @irin @MSNBC I think this will be a mistake Trump makes... he will accuse her of emotional thinking. The guy brings projecting to new level.
740544108654010370 2016-06-08 14:00:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @IrisL49 @KevinDarryl @JoyAnnReid Never did get those tax returns. 
740386202973396992 2016-06-07 03:33:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @Nysteveo2AOLcom whoa
740361006140907522 2016-06-07 01:53:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnDingell @BillKristol Strange bedfellows keep getting stranger.
740317024681762817 2016-06-07 22:58:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @DrJillStein @PaulTOwen Get help. From a real doctor.
740281370283413505 2016-06-07 20:36:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @KasiaMikurda @politico I'm guessing he's the one distributing all the brown acid. Explains the paranoid delusions.
740080058891567104 2016-06-07 07:16:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @djred678 @FiveThirtyEight I dunno... sounds fishy. Everyone knows a vote for a woman is only worth .89 of a vote for a man.
740078964685733889 2016-06-07 07:12:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @AP @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @justnbare @zokavera3344 Lay off the BS. Ya'lls inability to understand this system is why you lost. Bye!
740055539569201152 2016-06-06 05:39:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @pammaysmcdonald @CBSPolitics I'm imagining it as an LBJ moment for him.
740054292476743680 2016-06-06 05:34:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @AP @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @justnbare Whatever dude. AP reports the numbers. If they didn't report this they'd be suppressing facts.
740053689159684096 2016-06-06 05:32:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @smoothkobra "I'm sorry sir. Your card has been declined."
740052145957801984 2016-06-06 05:25:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @AP @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @justnbare Because voting is fun.
740007788563202049 2016-06-06 02:29:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @trcfwtt What can I say... I am prejudiced against orange people.
740004781561782272 2016-06-06 02:17:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @StillWithHer @WeRule11 @KaivanShroff Let's go full throttle into the general election!
739997933710409728 2016-06-06 01:50:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @SopanDeb @zefirotorna Kinda sounds like it. Hopefully his principles got the best of him.
739682483185147904 2016-06-05 04:57:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @jillstein @rosariodawson @Yello_gal I don't know how to tell her this, but that gal doesn't even look old enough to run for president.
739610951326957568 2016-06-05 00:12:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @IamPhreedah *Twilight zone music*  Thanks for the follow! Enjoy dinner! 
739610306066841600 2016-06-05 00:10:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @trcfwtt Gee I wonder if they really meant "uppity" all that time?
739608442235551745 2016-06-05 00:02:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @goldietaylor @NPR Why do I suddenly have "You Don't Own Me" stuck in my head? 
739604731538984961 2016-06-05 23:48:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @stephaniemagui4 It would be funny if it weren't so painfully stupid and predictable.
739603199523311616 2016-06-05 23:41:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @jorgeramosnews @MattMurph24 @washingtonpost Trump said he will disappear if he loses. Let's humiliate him with our votes and make it happen
739601295388987393 2016-06-05 23:34:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @MattMurph24 @realDonaldTrump @CNN Someone please ask Donald if he believes in the 1st Amendment. Simple question.
739599937671827457 2016-06-05 23:29:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @scottrgordon @koolleerlee Another reason not to bail out his debt when this is all over.
739598749245145089 2016-06-05 23:24:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @scottrgordon @koolleerlee Filing lawsuits isn't exactly cheap... incredible that he is spending the last of his $ on temper tantrums.
739592834651553792 2016-06-05 23:00:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @riotwomennn Desperately searching for a reporter he can storm away from.
739591380788383744 2016-06-05 22:55:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @BruceEnberg Whatever stranger. I'm no fool and I don't change my mind by being insulted. Bye!
739585617277788160 2016-06-05 22:32:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @Aneetchkoo @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid Perfect!  They blame media so much I wonder if Donald really believes in 1st Amendment? I'm not so sure...
739350651910520832 2016-06-04 06:58:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @KaraCalavera I know this feeling as well.
738981420282978304 2016-06-03 06:31:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @BernieSanders Did you hear Bernie has this great idea to turn loaves of bread into thin, stackable pieces? Genius!!

738944918639411200 2016-06-03 04:06:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @CeeisMee Why are the sprinkles so uneven? What is the implication?
738944752318439424 2016-06-03 04:05:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @CeeisMee Oh my.
738936192008224768 2016-06-03 03:31:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @CorporateBarbie Dammit, I meant to put quotes around "moral failures"...
738934498818068481 2016-06-03 03:24:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @CorporateBarbie I'm old enough to remember when "drug addicts" were moral failures. Guess their real failure was not being white.
738929376423645184 2016-06-03 03:04:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @dabearded0ne @thehill @DaBearded0ne Awww I was looking forward to them running as the "Fraud Squad."
738926132485980161 2016-06-03 02:51:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @SenJohnMcCain @Gus_802 @ABCLiz Yet they couldn't find a way to work with Obama. And they have the gall to claim principles and patriotism?
738905813268332545 2016-06-03 01:30:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @AP_Politics @AP Another wannabe dictator.
738768682424369152 2016-06-03 16:25:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @jonward11 @johnstodder The market for souls is really tanking.
738766501784653824 2016-06-03 16:17:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @Tyler_Tortoise Heh well at least he likes his veggies.
738719177192574978 2016-06-03 13:09:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @Tyler_Tortoise A true states-tortoise. Looks like he's about to give a speech :)
738333324511305728 2016-06-02 11:35:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @realDonaldTrump @sheenA_8886 @AP_Politics I'd say the media calling them "students" is granting too much credit. They were customers.
738254913801576449 2016-06-01 06:24:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @GeorgeTakei There otter be a law against being that cute!

738225847648165888 2016-06-01 04:28:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @WaPoSean @danpfeiffer @koolleerlee I really think he's too stupid to know CA is out of reach and his sycophants won't tell him the truth.
738222786137579520 2016-06-01 04:16:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @danpfeiffer @HawaiiDelilah @WaPoSean With all that money his campaign doesn't have?

738201804937170948 2016-06-01 02:53:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @DianeToucan @Tyler_Tortoise Can he have nail polish on his shell? He can be orange and fancy!  
738199703620198400 2016-06-01 02:44:59 UTC <stlouisishome> I disagree obviously.
738199385394139136 2016-06-01 02:43:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @Truthdig @BlueDuPage @DrJillStein @HillaryClinton Ah yes, based on their record of zero actual accomplishments.
738194453295288320 2016-06-01 02:24:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @azmoderate @AddInfoOrg AND he tells the truth about his accomplishments vs. the dangerous Republican ideology based on lies.
738116930913984513 2016-06-01 21:16:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @HEINSLERJAN Hahaha... It's funny cuz (he thinks) it's true.
738110078734065665 2016-06-01 20:48:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @HEINSLERJAN And what size breast implants will Hannity be getting?

737503054178582533 2016-05-30 04:36:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @PhilipRucker @AtticusinCanada @CHURCHLADY320 I think HRC is like the teacher kids think is "mean" cuz she assigns work and expects a lot...
737499533785980928 2016-05-30 04:22:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @PhilipRucker @AtticusinCanada @CHURCHLADY320 Explaining policy is boring and requires real understanding. Opinions are so cheap and easy!
737498339499876352 2016-05-30 04:18:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @PhilipRucker @NYCG8TR @AtticusinCanada @CHURCHLADY320 Media is pissed that her policies don't fit on a tee shirt.
737496526885261318 2016-05-30 04:10:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @PhilipRucker So sorry she is not a cult of personality. She prefers to discuss her real, workable policies with people who actually vote.
737319610697945088 2016-05-30 16:27:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @HEINSLERJAN Sad thing is when the "journalists" let them get away with it.
737315572182982656 2016-05-30 16:11:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @HEINSLERJAN Empty, pliable minds.
737310830585204736 2016-05-30 15:52:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @rodimusprime We still haven't gotten past the insidious idea that women are decorative prizes to be won by men... and discarded at will.
737136472143187968 2016-05-29 04:20:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @thedailybeast Uh how is this legal? I fail to see how this is not a hand job for women? Confused...
737038366974189568 2016-05-29 21:50:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @JessicaGoldstei @EtreEtro Florida Man.
736924668787974144 2016-05-29 14:18:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @DanaHoule Seems legit
736918429152641024 2016-05-29 13:53:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @HeerJeet White men just love to put themselves on the cross. That's why they turned Jesus white too.
736787476988067841 2016-05-28 05:13:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @MMonides I did my Saturday night on Thursday night. Now I'm all mixed up!
736718848611614720 2016-05-28 00:40:35 UTC <stlouisishome> @sarahkendzior Penguin for VP!
736716080333234176 2016-05-28 00:29:35 UTC <stlouisishome> @mattyglesias @cyberpreppy He does have permanent duck-lips face.
736603360900485125 2016-05-28 17:01:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @FeministaJones Sometimes when I'm bored/depressed, I get dressed up at home alone for fun.  Guess I just need non-existent men's approval!
736601422116978688 2016-05-28 16:53:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @Snowden @michaelianblack He's a stupid coward. But like all chauvinists his greatest fear is a strong woman in the form of Hillary Clinton.
736400556458004480 2016-05-27 03:35:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders @WonderWoman934 @koolleerlee Would be most fact free debate ever.
736399143107624965 2016-05-27 03:30:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @AP_Politics @koolleerlee And his idiot followers and surrogates will now parrot his stupidity as fact. Ugh.
736385703504793600 2016-05-27 02:36:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @KaraCalavera @Jonathan_Saker Well it's not like being president requires multi-tasking or anything.
735925481644531712 2016-05-26 20:08:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @amy_wood @JamesDallas9175 Peak mansplain achieved!
735798200431300610 2016-05-26 11:42:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @EricBoehlert @nytpolitics So they aren't going to be in a 3rd floor walk-up studio with a tattoo shop below? INAUTHENTIC!!%&#$#!
735336030711250944 2016-05-24 05:05:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @Green_Footballs @RiskyLiberal @ShaunKing Hahaha the pearl clutching is too much. I guess someone's never heard stories about JFK or FDR? 
734878617608425472 2016-05-23 22:48:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @JFKucinich @jmartNYT @jaketapper Where does he get off? Next he'll be telling her what to wear.
734650544132874240 2016-05-23 07:41:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @BuzzFeedAndrew I'm sure he's just worried about our periods attracting bears.
734561200898461697 2016-05-22 01:46:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @puppymnkey Sick asshole
734559265067667456 2016-05-22 01:39:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @Patrickesque @starfirst As usual he never intends to actually win, just needs an excuse to complain and play victim. Tiring.
734542916694089728 2016-05-22 00:34:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @oldbowers @Will_J_Bryan I wonder if they also think they should get to vote in the Republican primary? Why not every party?
734522128762953728 2016-05-22 23:11:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @foodandwine ... or anyone who isn't actually gluten intolerant.
734521736172015616 2016-05-22 23:10:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 They can figure out how to get a Rx for weed, but this is just too hard.
734505602169311232 2016-05-22 22:05:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @JamesDallas9175 @ZantiMisft @NaphiSoc @HillaryClinton @SenSanders His broke ass campaign wants free airtime! NO!
734503334590091264 2016-05-22 21:56:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @starfirst @doodlebug0 A filthy vulture. There's no low he won't stoop to for a dollar.
734252883353313281 2016-05-21 05:21:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @dissentingj Facts cannot penetrate Fort Berniac. It's protected by a moat of delusion.
734186105923211264 2016-05-21 00:56:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @ItsMalachi @daniecal I have a new respect for sea turtles.

734167676155662337 2016-05-21 23:43:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @AlGiordano This poll is rigged. I am writing in hamburgers!
734166487036891137 2016-05-21 23:38:25 UTC <stlouisishome> @sahilkapur @PAWarnhoff Yup... he dances around it like everything else. He wants to have his cake and eat it too.
734165638768271360 2016-05-21 23:35:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @sahilkapur @PAWarnhoff Well... neither do I. But I'm not a communist.
734164773013590016 2016-05-21 23:31:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @sahilkapur @PAWarnhoff Yikes!
734162048506986496 2016-05-21 23:20:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @sahilkapur @PAWarnhoff Bernie naifs wouldn't even know what hit them. They should thank Hillary for winning and sparing their savior.
734146078769963008 2016-05-21 22:17:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill @BevDiane Yup. Like we were all clamoring for another Bush to come in and wreck things again.
734144064916848641 2016-05-21 22:09:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @P0Tus @thehill It's like he's barely even trying to be wrong anymore. Sad!
734138796707483648 2016-05-21 21:48:23 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 I think my ovaries just shriveled up.
733873338951426049 2016-05-20 04:13:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @speechboy71 It's before my time, but I'll never forget a professor explaining how "activist" men tried to take over women's lib movement. 
733663735617748992 2016-05-20 14:20:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @politico @RaySalesWord He's so irresponsible. It's embarrassing.
733489904647180288 2016-05-19 02:49:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @JacquelynBaker8 @Johngcole Aren't Bernie Bots always saying polls are wrong when they predict Hillary wins over him?
733061207310012417 2016-05-18 22:26:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @WBRZ Um no. WTF?
732441672513163264 2016-05-16 05:24:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @Maggyw519 @lita_meza13 And they lie with such ease. It's nauseating.

732012529405169664 2016-05-15 00:59:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @mattdpearce This guy really took that "no liquids" rule seriously.
732010017696546816 2016-05-15 00:49:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @RexHuppke I care. Trump is a creep and a half. And his pathetic ass thinks women like him. Haha we laugh at men like him behind their backs
731999380291522561 2016-05-15 00:07:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @HillaryClinton @GilTPolitics @sunday_melissa @AugiesGrammie @SharonJ44257163 Yeah cuz he can't afford advertising, he wants free coverage.
731998307778580481 2016-05-15 00:02:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @leahmcelrath "Ask your ob/gyn if voting is right for you."
731997206958342146 2016-05-15 23:58:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @leahmcelrath I still haven't figured out how to vote with mine?

731964187979603969 2016-05-15 21:47:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @NerdyWonka @BreastsR4babies Agreed. Hope they know how many of us think the world of them.
731933949748903936 2016-05-15 19:47:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @Kragar_LGF I fully believe he is stupid enough to do this. Please make it so!
731924015271583744 2016-05-15 19:07:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @thedailybeast @TnGovern "Positive results"... Positive for late-stage syphilis?

731631941754052608 2016-05-14 23:47:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @WesleyLowery This guy makes my skin crawl. Every woman has met creeps like him and despite their delusions, we know they're PATHETIC losers

731519895880372224 2016-05-14 16:21:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @Patrickesque @blucaller I think it will! The "show me" state won't vote for a con man!

731379604741480448 2016-05-14 07:04:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @TEXASGOBLUE Just signed up!
731378255182237696 2016-05-13 06:58:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @TEXASGOBLUE Speaking of Wendy, she did a great early HRC event here last fall. So great to see her speak. I'd love to get to vote for her!
731377566922067968 2016-05-13 06:56:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @TEXASGOBLUE @LtGovTX @Serpentine202 @HuffPostPol That's where I am! My friend wants to register and canvass in the valley too. 
731374414885838848 2016-05-13 06:43:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @TEXASGOBLUE @LtGovTX @Serpentine202 @HuffPostPol Yes! I and many others I know are ready to get to work. I think we can do it!
731371607642411008 2016-05-13 06:32:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @DarthPutinKGB Meer suggestions.
731371060818386946 2016-05-13 06:30:23 UTC <stlouisishome> @LtGovTX @TEXASGOBLUE @Serpentine202 @HuffPostPol As if Texas Republicans ever gave a shit about evil Godless public education.
731367744684204032 2016-05-13 06:17:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @mcspocky @pattygergel And waste taxpayer money to boot!
731363416439324672 2016-05-13 06:00:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @cindywhitlock12 Agree. How else to explain the vague "I just don't like her" excuse? People who KNOW her, like her.
731347586485903361 2016-05-13 04:57:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @maggieNYT @AndyKindler @bigtiger547 I almost choked on my cereal.
731342572560388096 2016-05-13 04:37:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @AP @Aneetchkoo I thought same thing. My bf got picked up as a runaway/petty shoplifting as a teenager and Texas tossed him in juvie 3 years
731339114969096192 2016-05-13 04:23:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @BlakeDontCrack That's awful.
731335084746248192 2016-05-13 04:07:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @letsgomathias @CHURCHLADY320 Exactly! What a POS.
731333831454646273 2016-05-13 04:02:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @letsgomathias @HuffPostCrime Despicable.
731333235108548608 2016-05-13 04:00:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @tomtomorrow How does someone who knows nothing about politics get paid to talk about politics?
731321557444747264 2016-05-13 03:13:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @revmagdalen Yeah, Trump really understands women.
731310555865055232 2016-05-13 02:29:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @ItsKentMurphy @JohnRowlette Might.
731310503473991680 2016-05-13 02:29:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @ItsKentMurphy @JohnRowlette Damn... mor have to check that out. Pretty cool.
731308192001458176 2016-05-13 02:20:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @ItsKentMurphy @JohnRowlette Neat!
730901258110820352 2016-05-12 23:23:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @HEINSLERJAN I know, but they are radical theocrats who openly call for rewriting the Constitution. It's truly scary.
730879234650968064 2016-05-12 21:56:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @andreagrimes @HEINSLERJAN Not at all... Abbott and Patrick make Rick Perry look almost sane.
730861491184750592 2016-05-12 20:45:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @andreagrimes @HEINSLERJAN No, but our lieutenant governor apparently is. A. Grimes is reporting Patrick's speech from the TX Repub conv.
730768767022551042 2016-05-12 14:37:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @lhfang @gryking Sorry if I lack pity for the hateful white bigots who voted for their own demise and now want to take us down with them.
730675019685060608 2016-05-12 08:24:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @Aneetchkoo @Aroyaldmd @oldbowers I honestly am beginning to think it's good old fashioned nerd hate. Competency and smarts aren't "cool."
730282004084719616 2016-05-10 06:22:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @TEXASGOBLUE @MrDane1982 Me too! I've already seen Hillary/Castro buttons at HRC events here in ATX. Can't wait for the t-shirt!
730138513362952193 2016-05-10 20:52:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill Well we know Issa likes to set things on fire. First that strangely convenient warehouse fire, now on to the country. What a guy!
730066216715313152 2016-05-10 16:05:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @HEINSLERJAN @TinaMorphis @thedailybeast @realDonaldTrump So disingenuous. He's adopting Bernie's "above it all" act. Spare me.
730062047753338880 2016-05-10 15:48:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @Steverocks35 @ShaunKing GOP pundits and Trump have even pretended to like him... They play into the BS "DNC is mean to Bernie" narrative.
729876319912087553 2016-05-09 03:30:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @DUPUY77 @thehill @HillaryClinton I'm hoping so!
729865798924173319 2016-05-09 02:49:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @SowaTheArrogant @Impolitics Yup! And then set the bar so low that if she just managed to regurgitate some glib BS she was praised for it.
729816681900449792 2016-05-09 23:33:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @kkalmes2 Excellent decision 
729534031616872449 2016-05-08 04:50:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @TrixieDalek I'm looking forward to it already .
729533785440559105 2016-05-08 04:49:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @TrixieDalek Or do they just slink off for another 4 years of obscurity before popping up again to whine that "nothing changed."?
729533439590817793 2016-05-08 04:48:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @TrixieDalek Hell yes. I wonder.... when a candidate gets .3% of the vote, do they even bother with giving a concession speech?
729530747212570624 2016-05-08 04:37:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @TrixieDalek @HawaiiDelilah Heh ah yes, the Blue flavor. I know it well.
729529514246610946 2016-05-08 04:32:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @TrixieDalek @HawaiiDelilah It is good. What flavor??
729529295710756864 2016-05-08 04:31:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @TrixieDalek @HawaiiDelilah Heh I can certainly relate to that also!
729528940398698496 2016-05-08 04:30:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @HawaiiDelilah @TrixieDalek Good point!
729528303338426369 2016-05-08 04:27:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @jonlovett @BobbyJindal Not content with his  efforts to run Louisiana into the ground, he has set his sights higher. Thanks Bobby!
729526506582626308 2016-05-08 04:20:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @HawaiiDelilah @TrixieDalek It's cheap, easy, and fast, but healthier than Ramen noodles. Plus, so many options! Damn now I'm hungry... 
729433980982808576 2016-05-08 22:13:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @Nysteveo2AOLcom @David_Shorr @ron_fournier This photo is great. I LOLed.
729433405230743552 2016-05-08 22:10:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @David_Shorr @ron_fournier Utter stupidity.
729432631771693056 2016-05-08 22:07:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @HawaiiDelilah Hey we could do worse! 
729432158813593600 2016-05-08 22:05:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @FloridaforHRC @joanwalsh Me too Joan! Thank you for your thoughtful and intelligent presence in this crazy election season.
729430941823696897 2016-05-08 22:01:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @HawaiiDelilah Thanks!
729427580734996480 2016-05-08 21:47:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @HawaiiDelilah Love the dual implication that Hillary isn't a good mother & that women who aren't mothers can't share her values. Garbage.
729424683494350848 2016-05-08 21:36:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis Thank you!!! Republicans play the refs  calling factual reporting "liberal." So sick of it.
729417957542002692 2016-05-08 21:09:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @DrJillStein That's Secretary Clinton to you.
729171956612796416 2016-05-07 04:51:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @OFSCOTUS @brianefallon @JesseLehrich What a charmer.
729135329802784769 2016-05-07 02:26:23 UTC <stlouisishome> @fawfulfan @AshleyG_KVUE Same here. And against corporate economic blackmail.
729134025273577472 2016-05-07 02:21:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @fawfulfan @AshleyG_KVUE Yes! Despite Uber's efforts to badger us. I actually had a guy ask if I was "voting for uber" while I was voting!
729132139124391938 2016-05-07 02:13:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @letidmiranda @BuzzFeedNews No fair making me cry at work.  What a lovely, talented lady. Glad to see the kindness of strangers.
729126807761362948 2016-05-07 01:52:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 I think he just admitted that he's afraid of Hillary.
729121031965659136 2016-05-07 01:29:35 UTC <stlouisishome> @Hesiod2k11 @KailiJoy @Acosta Maybe he skipped class the day the teacher covered the 19th Amendment.
729116381342359552 2016-05-07 01:11:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @theonlyadult @IsItRainingInNY I love Twitter.
729111713652465664 2016-05-07 00:52:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @AP_Politics @upayr @AP Oscar Wilde, he is not.
729103764997574656 2016-05-07 00:20:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @frynaomifry Peak hipster.
729098974074834944 2016-05-07 00:01:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @seattlepi Hmm... Somehow I don't think this guy is "angry about the economy."
729098639402930176 2016-05-07 00:00:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @Green_Footballs These idiots are gonna wear out Jay Nixon's veto pen.
729096563214057472 2016-05-07 23:52:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @Kyle_Feldscher Huh?
729094615593197568 2016-05-07 23:44:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @azmoderate @joshtpm @Maggyw519 @TPM What could go wrong?
729091487246356480 2016-05-07 23:32:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @LawrenceBland Playstation Vue here. Had it for a month and don't miss crappy cable at all.
729088208244342785 2016-05-07 23:19:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @JamilahLemieux It never ceases to amaze me the ease with which people, esp men, will give their unsolicited opinions on a woman's body.
729086970878550016 2016-05-07 23:14:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @riotwomennn @RiotWomennn She is the embodiment of poise. Something her opponents know nothing about.
729084550584766464 2016-05-07 23:04:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @blakehounshell @MiamiHerald But... "Country First" right John?
729078588176130048 2016-05-07 22:40:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @Nysteveo2AOLcom @zatchry POTUS put the sowers of cynicism on notice today.
729072875882184704 2016-05-07 22:18:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @RaySalesWord @thehill Unfortunately he seems to want us to suffer too. 
728999519052947458 2016-05-07 17:26:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @JSavoly @cranevl @BlueNationRev #ImWithHer  and Her, and all the other courageous women who won't be intimidated by angry white male noise!
728996904499974145 2016-05-07 17:16:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 She said her family just has to account for at least 2 extra hours every time they fly.
728995649308393472 2016-05-07 17:11:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 A girl I work with is Indian and she told me she gets pulled out of line every single time she flies, often for over an hour.
728992116735549441 2016-05-07 16:57:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @smoothkobra Happy birthday!
728743373801054208 2016-05-06 00:28:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @FritzAlverez A tossed salad?
728647739207081984 2016-05-06 18:08:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @daveweigel Crab wontons from Pander Express.
728406639838044161 2016-05-05 02:10:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @Green_Footballs It's pathetic... and I'd go further and say they outright deny its existence even when confronted head on.
728370585424662530 2016-05-05 23:47:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @KatyTurNBC So... I guess it's not all that rigged after all and he was just carelessly sowing cynicism for personal gain?
728297583005728769 2016-05-05 18:57:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @CHOCLABLOVER @MMFlint Probably what he always does...complain that nothing is good enough & claim himself too pure to get involved.
728277002533244929 2016-05-05 17:35:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @alegriaboulange Oh yeah, I work weekends at a driving range and we get all types who love golf, but still a strong good ole boy contingent.
728231222887911425 2016-05-05 14:33:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill A malleable, racist ignoramus?
728230315320180736 2016-05-05 14:30:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @alegriaboulange @freespeak3 @Morning_Joe Joe's racism is the kind we see flourish among the Kountry Klub Krew.
728227732081938435 2016-05-05 14:19:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @Rschooley @KevinMKruse You're right... in fact I think you just summed up Trump's campaign.
728226255351336961 2016-05-05 14:14:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC Those who deny blatant racism in front of them are racists too, JOE!
728090127394738176 2016-05-04 05:13:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @goddamnedfrank He just chose the loudest demographic.
728088442882523138 2016-05-04 05:06:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @higfhupp @skorpyos You do know Byrd publicly renounced and apologized for his racist past and became civil rights advocate? Gimme a break.
728074708139139072 2016-05-04 04:11:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @higfhupp @skorpyos @HillaryClinton It's a fake picture. But nothing gets by you I'm sure!
728074081183006721 2016-05-04 04:09:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @HILLYES @HillYes I'm glad to know all the people whose "principles" aren't so bothered by a guy who promises to kill innocents & commit war crimes.
728050574323650562 2016-05-04 02:35:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Man I would hate playing sports with those folks. But then I bet many are also the anti-sports snobs too.
727989403180670977 2016-05-04 22:32:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @theonlyadult @joshuafoust I wish there was a way to let them live under Trump while we get Hillary.
727875875597737984 2016-05-04 15:01:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @brownandbella @AskiyaAli True. I'm just getting greedy... I want to turn Texas blue too!
727874517704396801 2016-05-04 14:56:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @brownandbella @AskiyaAli I think she can flip Missouri back to blue.
727872941308837891 2016-05-04 14:50:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @GroverNorquist Isn't your wife a Muslim? I guess you figure your political prominence will protect your family. How nice for you.
727868647088132097 2016-05-04 14:33:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @brianbeutler I'm going back to bed.
727629832499044353 2016-05-03 22:44:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill Why? The media already do that for him.
727615999248191488 2016-05-03 21:49:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @AlanKestrel750 They also agree on not releasing tax returns.
727566266886590465 2016-05-03 18:31:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @eileendefreest @waltb31 Blocked the Bern.
727489019274125313 2016-05-03 13:24:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @TinaMorphis I don't understand why people who apparently don't understand political systems get to write about politics.
727374415084711937 2016-05-02 05:49:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 @KasiaMikurda @BernieSanders Natural banking. With money made from organic hemp.
727361298472660992 2016-05-02 04:57:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @USATODAY @ForTheWin Maybe Glenn Beck can start a wingnut sports network for him.
727309073528418305 2016-05-02 01:29:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @SabrinaSiddiqui Great news!
727303830640062466 2016-05-02 01:08:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @CNNPolitics "Painted"? More like exposed.
727121246417096705 2016-05-02 13:03:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @MeLovesMLE @djbratpack Done... what a sick freak.
726965234921951233 2016-05-01 02:43:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @linnyitssn I knew it!!!!!
726957864032423936 2016-05-01 02:13:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @RepublicanSwine @Salon To be fair, other Republican governors are trying really hard to be  worst. Snyder, LePage, McCrory are all worthy..
726930210327695361 2016-05-01 00:24:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @LaCarola0608 @Only4RM They have shitty lives and have nothing left but hated rotting them from inside. Hope they choke on it.
726924458636677120 2016-05-01 00:01:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @PuestoLoco @ABC POTUS will own you... and you won't even see it coming.  Hahaha
726919479414812673 2016-05-01 23:41:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @imraansiddiqi Is it true if you sprinkle salt on a Geo, it will disintegrate?
726913291931422720 2016-05-01 23:16:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @CNNPolitics @ericbradner She will make the most of her gifts, I have no doubt. I am excited to see what her future brings.
726909760184848384 2016-05-01 23:02:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @CookTheGreat @KeithSpera @jazzfest Bummer :(
726811983333335041 2016-05-01 16:34:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @cmclymer Most of them couldn't get into clown school.
726787943558340608 2016-05-01 14:58:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis That is a modest proposal.
726787326362308608 2016-05-01 14:56:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @jonfavs @HeerJeet They still bristle if you remind them how Bush led them by the nose on Iraq. They got played hard and didn't learn shit.
726640462019194880 2016-04-30 05:12:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @NerdyWonka @bbkenn92 Maybe if we hide his car keys, he won't be able to leave??
726639309076369408 2016-04-30 05:08:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill Pretty sure it was deBlasio's joke, not Hillary's.
726595410706333697 2016-04-30 02:13:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @KeshRue I never knew I could really cry and laugh at the same time. 
726575699713089536 2016-04-30 00:55:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @MattMurph24 @KateBennett_DC @BernieSanders I hate button collars.
726569474594246656 2016-04-30 00:30:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @Steverocks35 @Gus_802 @BernieSanders Bill huh? As in BILLARY?!? Come the revolution laws will be passed via "bernies"!
726567187943555072 2016-04-30 00:21:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 @BernieSanders Should we all chip in to send Bernie a copy of Schoolhouse Rock?
726564877607686145 2016-04-30 00:12:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis So... the author had their tongue planted firmly in cheek on this one, right? Please?
726562162508853248 2016-04-30 00:01:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @tomservo10 I don't know what this is... but I like it.
726426673894187008 2016-04-30 15:03:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @joshtpm @The_NeoKong Turned it into a thriving, dynamic, international economy?
726424195580616704 2016-04-30 14:53:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @Oooooo_Donna @PuestoLoco @YouTube Maybe they got shipped to Sierra Blanca too?
726423040775475200 2016-04-30 14:48:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @RawStory He sure is bristly for being "the nice guy."
726421906245591042 2016-04-30 14:44:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @elenaparent @kharyp @nprpolitics He'll put us all in his pageant!
726420779886215169 2016-04-30 14:39:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @thewayoftheid Another thing men should STFU about unless we ask. And I'll only ask if he is a professional and I am paying him $$. So...
726416489620754432 2016-04-30 14:22:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 My mom's old joke from her Soviet friends was, "We pretend to work. They pretend to pay us."
726415987650650114 2016-04-30 14:20:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @PuestoLoco @YouTube They are stalling more than my old Plymouth.
726413939811053568 2016-04-30 14:12:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 @Snowden Does Putin send gift baskets or cards as thanks? I'd prefer cards since they are harder to poison.
726412480633675777 2016-04-30 14:06:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @thewayoftheid Riiiiight. These are usually the same guys who refuse to believe pictures in magazines are photoshopped.
726410469649444866 2016-04-30 13:58:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @60th_Street @thewayoftheid I used to put it on my ex when he was a TV reporter. That shit is THICK.
726130678341853185 2016-04-29 19:26:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @ThePlumLineGS This is shocking! Donald Trump has friends?!
725911942909464576 2016-04-28 04:57:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @Patrickesque @ZantiMisft I might need something stronger.
725911537374756867 2016-04-28 04:56:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @SpryGuy Cuz Jesus?
725909475677216768 2016-04-28 04:48:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette Cool, thanks! I will be buying soon too. I used to live in Seattle so I'd be happy to patronize my childhood city.
725908289498685440 2016-04-28 04:43:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette BTW, What's the company?
725907134471270400 2016-04-28 04:38:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette Damn! McCrory's already whining about backlash. Stand by your stupid hateful principles governor. You were so sure about them.
725905852494811136 2016-04-28 04:33:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette Yup! And it has the bonus of working the rubes into a lather over nothing.
725905600106762242 2016-04-28 04:32:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette The sooner, the better.
725904346471256064 2016-04-28 04:27:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette A woman wearing pants? Hey at least we know we can trust cops to make good judgments about these delicate matters!
725903118043500547 2016-04-28 04:22:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette Well you know, it's all for the children.
725900852636975105 2016-04-28 04:13:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette Haha "Religious freedom! Argle bargle!"
725900109045600256 2016-04-28 04:10:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette Heh maybe that's the secret to immortality.
725899176395952130 2016-04-28 04:07:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette Yes! And Trump is the bastard child of all those bankrupt ideas. Can't wait til they all go down in flames.
725897646028681216 2016-04-28 04:00:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette Now they are making sure religious charities, no matter how complex, are untouchable by gov regs & can openly discriminate.
725896791837659136 2016-04-28 03:57:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette And vouchers, charter schools... notice how often they talk about how charities should be providing social services, not gov.
725895674030518273 2016-04-28 03:53:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette Yes. I also suspect they would prefer we be at the mercy of Christian charities and business.
725895051369279489 2016-04-28 03:50:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette Their primary goal now is simply to gut social services and education.
725893878486695937 2016-04-28 03:46:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette They continue to expose themselves for the nihilists they are. They have no core ideology anymore. Strictly reactionary.
725892566906884096 2016-04-28 03:40:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette @TimeLordJeff Yeah funny how proud they are of their treason and enslavement.
725891129040756736 2016-04-28 03:35:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette @TimeLordJeff So true! And always trying to hide their true agenda behind religion, patriotism, fear... whatever was handy.
725890066514485248 2016-04-28 03:30:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette @TimeLordJeff Amazing how far they've fallen. And all Obama had to do was be himself and watch them unravel.
725888826179121152 2016-04-28 03:25:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnRowlette @TimeLordJeff They have nothing to run on and they know it. They are reduced to bathroom bills and Trump. Karma is a bitch.
725886100544200704 2016-04-28 03:15:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @ZaibatsuNews "No fair! She's only winning cuz people like her more!" Huh? Perhaps she is confused about how elections work...
725865216001499136 2016-04-28 01:52:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @HalloweenBlogs Haha ok Jane!  Hey why even allow anyone else to run at all? Dems should just bow down and hand him the nomination, right?
725861070213009408 2016-04-28 01:35:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @HalloweenBlogs @MSNBC @MaddowBlog @maddow Just did the same thing. I'd rather watch baseball. At least the loser doesn't blame the umps.
725854928661442562 2016-04-28 01:11:15 UTC <stlouisishome> @princessomuch @POLSPortsmouth @TPM Who? 
725525351363801088 2016-04-27 03:21:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @MichelleHux It's exhausting seeing the same excuses and lies. Will his family get justice? I wish there werent so many reasons to b cynical
725522483810463744 2016-04-27 03:10:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @ABCPolitics 900,000 busy-bodies with nothing better to do than imagine the bathroom activities of strangers. Hatred sure does rot brains...
725481700898164736 2016-04-27 00:28:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @KPhed @jaketapper When did stating facts become such a problem? Is this the twilight zone?
725180456853852161 2016-04-26 04:31:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @ee_neh @DrJillStein No. Bye.
725148488921567232 2016-04-26 02:24:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @thefix @TheFix @vine "Who am I? Why am I here?"
725057119284662272 2016-04-26 20:21:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @ilovaussiesheps @60th_Street @cindynorth1 @Gus_802 Impressive! Can they see into the future?
725056277454278656 2016-04-26 20:17:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @60th_Street @ilovaussiesheps @cindynorth1 @Gus_802 I've tried, but boyfriend is like human waste disposal. I can't leave food unattended.
725052325153263616 2016-04-26 20:01:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @ilovaussiesheps @60th_Street @cindynorth1 @Gus_802 Wow! And I thought *I* was good at wasting money... this is some next level shit.
725044720276107264 2016-04-26 19:31:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Cold-pressed
725044647404265475 2016-04-26 19:31:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 @ilovaussiesheps @60th_Street @cindynorth1 Wow. Sounds.... lucrative.
725044108046147584 2016-04-26 19:29:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 @ilovaussiesheps @60th_Street @cindynorth1 Wait, is this a thing?
724986094798798849 2016-04-26 15:38:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @RawStory Are republican governors in a competition for biggest POS? If so, they are all upping their game this year.
724465616069885952 2016-04-24 05:10:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill Congrats to them! You are never too old for love.
724425016922656768 2016-04-24 02:29:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @tx_blue_dot If this is the kind of "angry white male" media keep telling Hillary she needs to win,    I say let them stay mad! We DON'T.
724423433736474624 2016-04-24 02:23:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @tx_blue_dot No kidding! Must not think very well to begin with.
724421373326557184 2016-04-24 02:14:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @tx_blue_dot Good question! So shameful. Hope dem leaders make it clear we don't want or need 19th century thinking in our party. BYE JIM!
724417784608747521 2016-04-24 02:00:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @tx_blue_dot @washingtonpost He's so pathetically bitter. Guess he's pissed he got beat by a woman. I wish I could laugh in his face.
724415151353401345 2016-04-24 01:50:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @ABswl16 @danmericaCNN Ha you beat me to it!  :)
724415047963807744 2016-04-24 01:49:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @danmericaCNN Who?
724363695296401410 2016-04-24 22:25:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill How cute, he's "playing president."
724359918271102981 2016-04-24 22:10:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @lawhawk @thehill He must REALLY not wanna go back to Ohio. Does he think they'll be mad at him or something?
724359212764028928 2016-04-24 22:07:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 @NoticiasCaracol Great picture. Looks like he just got hit in the face.
724358403963785216 2016-04-24 22:04:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @prof_carrington @DrBobBullard Heh. Nice.
724352356645654528 2016-04-24 21:40:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @sheenA_8886 @js_edit @DrJillStein They shout from the sidelines and think it's work. Too good to get in the dirt where the real fight is.
724344620855914496 2016-04-24 21:09:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @politicalwire It's fun to pretend!
724328892664676352 2016-04-24 20:07:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @BuzzFeedAndrew @BuzzFeedNews Donald thinks wives are just "the help" except he can legally ask them for sex.
724047665101570048 2016-04-23 01:29:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @VBDahlgren @NPR Thanks!
724031726691868673 2016-04-23 00:26:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @SnovaCain Glad to hear... every little bit helps!
724031114558365697 2016-04-23 00:24:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @gregpinelo @HillarysUterus @ElizLanders @BernieSanders @rosariodawson Funny how people show their true nature when they're losing. Not good
724028560080412673 2016-04-23 00:13:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @SnovaCain And in doing that they are letting her rapist, a man who is an accused CRIMINAL, off the hook.
724027289512480768 2016-04-23 00:08:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @SnovaCain Mormons have been pushed to change in the past re polygamy and racial views. They can change this attitude too.
724027092816424960 2016-04-23 00:08:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @SnovaCain But it doesn't protect women. Only empowering women and punishing rapists protects women. Being Mormon doesn't change that
724025823502561280 2016-04-23 00:03:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @SnovaCain Sorry but this mentality is not restricted to Mormon campuses.
724025366352781312 2016-04-23 00:01:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @joanwalsh @philosodork @brightstrangely Do they also think they should get to vote in the Republican primary? Why or why not?
724023137436721152 2016-04-23 23:52:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @SnovaCain Get over yourself. You don't understand anything. You tell yourself making "rules" to control women will stop rape. They don't.
724020896592060416 2016-04-23 23:43:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @GareBearEsq @JKH2 Exactly.
724020634498437120 2016-04-23 23:42:25 UTC <stlouisishome> @SnovaCain Knock off the patronizing. Rape is not "mating." Your attitude absolves rapists of responsibility for their actions. Expect more.
724017235937742848 2016-04-23 23:28:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @LOLGOP Also, Dennis Hastert and Josh Duggar. .. Great guys!
724016361358290945 2016-04-23 23:25:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @jkh @JKH Ah OK. Good to know!
724015879088791552 2016-04-23 23:23:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @GareBearEsq @JKH2 @chrislhayes And such a great speech!
724003746728931329 2016-04-23 22:35:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Pretty neat. Who knew the shilling business was so lucrative?
723990356719599616 2016-04-23 21:42:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Oh boy! Do we get direct deposit?
723926193888591873 2016-04-23 17:27:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @jsavite @jaketapper Can we send this dirtbag to prison yet? He and Hastert can be bunk-mates.
723906495398567938 2016-04-23 16:08:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @DanaHoule I'm thinking it's code for "Liberals were right about things and now they have the nerve to point it out!"
723905259718905858 2016-04-23 16:03:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @WhiskeyInSpace @DZdyke @smoothkobra Exactly! As a country we've been investing in angry white men since day 1. They can get on or get left.
723902573892128768 2016-04-23 15:53:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @micnews Sorry this sounds like George Zimmerman's idea. WTF?!
723900689877880832 2016-04-23 15:45:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis Calling liberals "smug"... sounds like more thinly-veiled anti-intellectualism.
723898087672975361 2016-04-23 15:35:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @smoothkobra I think reason for the attacks is because he is front-runner. Much has also been from the purity left trying to damage Hillary.
723895760320761856 2016-04-23 15:26:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @WhiskeyInSpace I know I'm excited about it!
723890371906805761 2016-04-23 15:04:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @mattyglesias @tbhayward I tend to disagree... especially if they're running against a ticket headed by Trump with 0 government experience.
723879041774690304 2016-04-23 14:19:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @theonlyadult @JohnKasich He should be thanking Obama for keeping his state afloat. But no... Another ungrateful republican.
723877134842765314 2016-04-23 14:12:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnMonch @MikeGrunwald With gusto! I mean really, have they no shame or decency? None at all? This is truly disturbing.
723873761741565952 2016-04-23 13:58:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnMonch @MikeGrunwald Thank you for saying their names! They need to be broadcast loud and clear.
723873566698033152 2016-04-23 13:58:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnMonch @MikeGrunwald Did they think no one would notice? Keep these pathetic excuses for men away from women, children, & legislating.
723872116500615168 2016-04-23 13:52:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @paulkrugman Hey Delay, murderers in prison know child molesters are scum. It's a shame you never did time. You might've learned decency.
723869245931544580 2016-04-23 13:40:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @MikeGrunwald @politico So... Republicans are now cool with child molesters. But then we learned that from Duggars clan. Repubs are sick.
723763057416015872 2016-04-22 06:38:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @SnovaCain I suggest you expect more of the men you know. Women are not your prey. Have some goddamn self respect or at least self control.
723755142240067584 2016-04-22 06:07:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @VABVOX @NanditaDidi I maintain they are equally dangerous. Thankfully Hillary will be our next president and we'll never have to find out!
723752064812109824 2016-04-22 05:55:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @NanditaDidi @VABVOX Same here in Texas! Only thing separating me from Greg Abbott next year is Hillary. I refuse to live in a theocracy.
723750874569281537 2016-04-22 05:50:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @VABVOX @washingtonpost There's nothing honorable or pure about political blackmail.
723749366335307776 2016-04-22 05:44:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @washingtonpost I imagine their disinfectant wipe budget will be pretty steep.
723742530043420672 2016-04-22 05:17:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @SnovaCain @kelly_poe Women would rather be RESPECTED than protected. These bullshit rules only ever seem to "protect" MEN who rape women.
723738500403617792 2016-04-22 05:01:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Maybe instead of reminding US how evolved they are, Europe can start working on themselves and their simmering racist nationalism.
723732085828030464 2016-04-22 04:35:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @TheAtlantic The Republican economic philosophy is a massive con job. They will turn our whole country into Kansas if we let them.
723376886139609089 2016-04-21 05:04:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @NPR Watch out for people asking you to sign your rights away for a job. There's a reason.
723374093882384384 2016-04-21 04:53:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @Slate Because they lie and divide Americans.
723368099940966401 2016-04-21 04:29:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @Plantflowes @thehill He can't help himself. He can't appeal to gen election voters. Don't think "soccer mom" republicans will like this...
723362545780678656 2016-04-21 04:07:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @CorrectRecord @amyklobuchar @HillaryClinton @TIME Yes, how dare she be liked by the people we'll need to push better laws?
723159250613104640 2016-04-21 14:39:35 UTC <stlouisishome> @fawfulfan @austintexasgov Especially when the widening is for rich people's toll lanes. Spread the inconvenience and none of the benefit.
723157047085142017 2016-04-21 14:30:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @freep "coerced into sex" sounds like a euphemism for rape. I guess because it is.
723154781993234432 2016-04-21 14:21:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @GMA @HillaryClinton I'll drink to that #MadamPresident
723148975147118592 2016-04-21 13:58:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @ZeddRebel ...But only because the BF works at a strip club.
723146596829921281 2016-04-21 13:49:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @PoliticsBuzzSaw Cynical speculation about an imaginary quid pro quo arrangement, without proof, is not logic. It's contrived slander.
723139625028472832 2016-04-21 13:21:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnMonch They're both so scary in their own way.
722986697898627072 2016-04-20 03:13:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @chemoelectric @Gus_802 That was the year he started marching for civil rights, right?
722976289057968128 2016-04-20 02:32:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @MacMargi @GlennThrush Wind them up and watch them go!
722975658834432001 2016-04-20 02:30:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @redsoxfred @Deadspin OMG you might be right!
722975234828038144 2016-04-20 02:28:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @WillMcAvoyACN @davidcrotts @espn Wish they would wise up and can that renowned sexist asshat Berman too.
722974310155980800 2016-04-20 02:24:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @TheUndefeated @JamilahLemieux People may laugh at my "useless" History degree but at least I know who Harriet Tubman is...
722972106586083328 2016-04-20 02:15:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @Plantflowes @KPhed The left hand doesn't know what the leftier hand is doing, it seems.
722971586727280641 2016-04-20 02:13:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @TheStevenThomas @rogiloc Someone should tell these folks that "honesty" is not the same as "Things I like to hear."
722965144939036677 2016-04-20 01:48:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @RawStory Ha I was just complaining the other day that he was back on the air. Good riddance. More Jessica Mendoza please!
722747664404602881 2016-04-20 11:24:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @AstoriaTom @KPhed @thehill Yeah! Turns out "Ben and Jerry" is a pretty good description of his base.
722671776170446848 2016-04-19 06:22:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @BillinPortland Graciousness is not really their thing. Besides, they are going to need to expend any spare energy on new excuses for loss.
722612953451618304 2016-04-19 02:28:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @tx_blue_dot @rolling_2 I dare him to call New Yorkers "low information voters." But then he only punches at those be knows won't punch back
722609962472448002 2016-04-19 02:16:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @tx_blue_dot @rolling_2 @paulkrugman The Berniacs are gonna be extra touchy from here on out I think.
722606802941059074 2016-04-19 02:04:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @rolling_2 @tx_blue_dot @paulkrugman Hahaha Krugman DGAF anymore.
722603887723618304 2016-04-19 01:52:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @djolder This is the guy who says in his ads that he doesn't like phonies and blowhards? That he likes doers? Guess he was lying.
722484119532216321 2016-04-19 17:56:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @Only4RM @thinkprogress If I show up the day after a voting day, can I whine about my rights being stolen too?
722304351096725504 2016-04-18 06:02:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @JeffersonObama @SeanMcElwee They never, EVER, give her the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile Bernie collects praise just for showing up.
722168917972557824 2016-04-18 21:04:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @goddamnedfrank His pure and virgin eyes shall not be sullied by your icky "Congressional reports."
722153145787256832 2016-04-18 20:01:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @Plantflowes @samsteinhp And such SORE losers. Geez.
722137628552790018 2016-04-18 19:00:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @AlGiordano For the record, that guy really is a first rate douche. My friend took a girl out for dinner and JL hit on his date all night.
721939651867463680 2016-04-17 05:53:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @nytimes That's why I use a Brita filter.
721934481326616576 2016-04-17 05:32:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @Maggyw519 @gregpinelo @UtopiasTaint I find those particularly upsetting. What a horrible phrase to use about anyone. Sich violent imagery.
721774343059951620 2016-04-17 18:56:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @M4v3r1ckX Who in their right mind would think this is even ok? Is this their idea of outreach?
721755165284368385 2016-04-17 17:40:15 UTC <stlouisishome> @root_e @phase_xii @VABVOX @MattMurph24 @lhfang Yup. Ensures you never have to be held responsible for anything. Sweet deal.
721747844403605504 2016-04-17 17:11:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @dissentingj *whiplash*
721746020640497664 2016-04-17 17:03:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @andrewplawiuk @Plantsmantx Ah so you admit they had to be bailed out. Why can't Bernie?
721745532578697216 2016-04-17 17:01:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @TIME I'm oddly proud of my alma mater for this study. #Mizzou
721745002561282048 2016-04-17 16:59:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @marilocosta @Gus_802 WTF. The black and Latino supporters I know can tell you damn well why they are voting for her.
721744186131677184 2016-04-17 16:56:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @Plantsmantx @andrewplawiuk Has
721744130443911169 2016-04-17 16:56:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @Plantsmantx @andrewplawiuk Me too! This thinking had brought down nations and economies.
721743788121522178 2016-04-17 16:55:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @andrewplawiuk @Plantsmantx Please cite law they could be prosecuted under. Then please check facts and see they paid back $ with interest.
721737857535070208 2016-04-17 16:31:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @Plantsmantx @andrewplawiuk He's also hiding behind adults in the Senate who did the responsible thing so he could demagogue w/o consequence
721734083777138688 2016-04-17 16:16:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @phase_xii @Salon They are performing anti-journalism. Actively misinforming people. Hope they are proud.
721733094588297216 2016-04-17 16:12:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @InaMaziarcz @CNN I'm so sick of these idiots. Remind me of their treatment of Bush. They just repeat press releases and call it news!
721586516468768768 2016-04-16 06:30:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @PCalith @HuffPostPol Only the willfully dense can't understand it.
721520925372321793 2016-04-16 02:09:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @JenGranholm @HillaryClinton @GeorgeCloooney Thank you for saying what the pundits always manage to leave out!
721474413837725697 2016-04-16 23:04:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @MacMargi @YouTube Watched it today!  Great speech!
721438457780789248 2016-04-16 20:41:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @goprapebuster Tells you how shallow the political understanding is. Good at tearing down, not so good at building. Like Bernie and banks...
721435424267186176 2016-04-16 20:29:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @goprapebuster @rfkjunior @MMFlint That's gotta hurt. But you know... Gore was just like Bush.
721434074791804929 2016-04-16 20:24:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @goprapebuster @edgeoforever So true!!
721376067206782977 2016-04-16 16:33:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @TheFreshBrew @guardian @HillaryClinton Guardian has been blatant about their hate for Hillary. Ran that pathetic subway story too.
721373912647356418 2016-04-16 16:25:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @rick00979 @docrocktex26 I can pretty much afford to stay in bed.
721370613370105858 2016-04-16 16:12:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 What sorcery is this?
721368440519335936 2016-04-16 16:03:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @docrocktex26 Thanks! I'm honored 
721365579152527360 2016-04-16 15:52:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @docrocktex26 Can we call him a champagne socialist yet?
721359590038712320 2016-04-16 15:28:23 UTC <stlouisishome> @insanityreport They can't ever explain how Obama managed to overcome this supposedly rigged system.
721355291984400384 2016-04-16 15:11:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @TinaMorphis Hey whatever works! Fishing is always relaxing.
721354520593215488 2016-04-16 15:08:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @TinaMorphis @keithboykin @MSNBC Same! Baseball season couldn't come at a better time.
721352214317387777 2016-04-16 14:59:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @marilocosta  Yikes. I grew up in Seattle. Glad my parents had common sense. Never thought measles would be trendy...
721351037349552128 2016-04-16 14:54:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @marilocosta Interesting.
721350703273373698 2016-04-16 14:53:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @MLB Hey MLB - women want real REAL baseball gear. And please stop turning mother's day into breast cancer day.
721349684187410433 2016-04-16 14:49:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @Ahnid @marilocosta @RickHopkins52 @MarkHarrisNYC I've wondered how much overlap between Berniacs and anti-vaxxers?
721348459534491648 2016-04-16 14:44:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @brownandbella I'm guessing these kids were too sheltered to play competitive sports.
721347124000989184 2016-04-16 14:38:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @edgeoforever Honorary woman my ass. I'd like to see him manage an hour in heels.
721345249956659201 2016-04-16 14:31:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @elysnowangel @ABC The tax  returns are how we know about them.
721344760640720897 2016-04-16 14:29:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @elysnowangel @ABC Hillary has decades of detailed returns released. Is that what you're asking?
721343141853265920 2016-04-16 14:23:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @insanityreport My guess is they'll blame wall street.
721216368062832640 2016-04-15 05:59:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Don't scapegoat trangendered people to me. I know who the real perpetrators are.
721215285898792960 2016-04-15 05:54:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat @FDRLST My best friend is transgender and a rape victim. This is not where you want to go with me.
721211973065510912 2016-04-15 05:41:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Very glad to hear! I would still say that prosecutions, and even more so convictions, are the exception not the rule.
721211185626877953 2016-04-15 05:38:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @Ish @HalloweenBlogs Just the usual moose droppings.
721210960526991360 2016-04-15 05:37:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @TimClarnnwell @Shoq @BISSELLclean Well that takes care of that decision! Thanks everyone!
721210673334628352 2016-04-15 05:36:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat What was the outcome?
721209363822616576 2016-04-15 05:31:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat I can't say I would want my rapist dead. We all react differently to trauma and abuse.
721208694600372224 2016-04-15 05:28:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Your sisters deserve justice. Not all women/victims want their attackers dead though. Many have very conflicted feelings.
721203496091930624 2016-04-15 05:08:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Studying and practicing are different but I urge you to dig deeper and listen to victims.
721203139081187328 2016-04-15 05:06:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat You too.
721202548330221568 2016-04-15 05:04:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat I wonder if you've ever been involved in a legal case of any sort. Seriously.
721202166451449856 2016-04-15 05:02:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Talk to a criminal defense lawyer or prosecutor. You are massively oversimplifying these situations.
721201430200070145 2016-04-15 04:59:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat I'm guessing you have never been raped.
721201296032686080 2016-04-15 04:59:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat I'm sorry but you need to talk and listen to the stories of actual victims. They will tell you your theories don't hold water.
721200422258495488 2016-04-15 04:55:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat She will be on the witness stand, her entire life story/sexual history parsed. A jury instructed on "beyond reasonable doubt."
721199608559341568 2016-04-15 04:52:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat I'm sorry but this is totally ludicrous. You describe a situation that does not apply to almost any rape, on campus or off.
721199242224599040 2016-04-15 04:51:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat What evidence??! All he's done is threaten!
721199085634461696 2016-04-15 04:50:35 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat This is movie fantasy scenario. In real life, he's the dead star QB. She is now a lying murderous slut.
721198509341286401 2016-04-15 04:48:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Great. No witnesses? No evidence? That woman is going to prison.
721198242323562496 2016-04-15 04:47:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Frankly I don't know what I would say if I told someone I was raped and their reaction was to ask why I didn't kill him.
721197264312541184 2016-04-15 04:43:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat This assumes a woman is willing to take a life in the first place. I can't imagine shooting anyone and I don't like guns.
721196854818439169 2016-04-15 04:41:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat So he has to have already blackened her eye? THEN she can kill him? Again, we can't even get DV convictions with clear bruises
721195446471778305 2016-04-15 04:36:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Many women come forward. They are then interrogated on every detail, doubted. Their forensic evidence left to collect dust.
721194987765899264 2016-04-15 04:34:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Domestic abusers often have violent and abusive records. It hasn't helped the women who kill their abusers.
721194483111452672 2016-04-15 04:32:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Most rapes don't even get prosecuted due to lack of evidence to prove force. But somehow she'll shoot the star QB and walk?
721193229715054593 2016-04-15 04:27:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat And if he overpowers her and takes it? If she left her purse across the room? If he's a "friend" or date?
721192904518074370 2016-04-15 04:26:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat So a drunk, possibly incapacitated 19 year old woman is going to effectively use a gun at a possibly crowded party? Nope.
721192421820801024 2016-04-15 04:24:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Ok. And those role models need to specifically teach that women are not disposable objects who exist at/for their pleasure.
721191697275756545 2016-04-15 04:21:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat How do you prove self defense? Women get locked up all the time for shooting their domestic abusers. But cops'll just believe?
721191182835920896 2016-04-15 04:19:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat This is... horrible terrible dangerous advice. It's a really good way to be raped AND killed.
721190660078895104 2016-04-15 04:17:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Hahaha great idea. Jesus you can't be serious.
721190555489673216 2016-04-15 04:16:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat Our society still rewards men who get "sex" through preying on women, even if it's not sex at all. I see it all the time.
721190120603254784 2016-04-15 04:14:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat It happens because people don't make it clear that predatory behavior is unacceptable. Too many people make light, turn away.
721188035111456768 2016-04-15 04:06:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat I'm suggesting that all the "advice" for women all these years hasn't seemed to stop  predators from being predators.
721186939831918592 2016-04-15 04:02:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat I have had my share of drinks in my life. I've never been raped by alcohol. Expect more of your fellow men.
721184028330631169 2016-04-15 03:50:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat I never said victim blaming. I suggested rapist blaming.
721183669814099968 2016-04-15 03:49:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat @AlanRHooper @MSNBC @usnews I'm just so tired of getting lectured on how to not be raped. So very tired.
721182777320693760 2016-04-15 03:45:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @truthfulchat @AlanRHooper @MSNBC @usnews Don't explain how rape happens to me. Work on your fellow men who rape.
721156666184454144 2016-04-15 02:02:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @LucasPattan @ABCLiz Must be nice!
721156359765381120 2016-04-15 02:00:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @AlanRHooper @MSNBC I appreciate you saying that.
721152520379183104 2016-04-15 01:45:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @azmoderate @avengingmomgel These transcript fiends only want them released so they can pick her apart more. Was never a good faith request!
721151245684060160 2016-04-15 01:40:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @AlanRHooper @MSNBC Bullshit. Rape is not "getting in trouble." Rapists and their scummy apologists will no longer be coddled.
721150495075602433 2016-04-15 01:37:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @JJohnsonLaw Berniacs make up the rules as they go along. Precedence and history don't apply to Bernie the Pure.
721146969733750784 2016-04-15 01:23:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @nbcchicago My advice to men: stop raping women. You are not entitled to anyone's body or time EVER. It's not that goddamn hard.
721146493856391168 2016-04-15 01:21:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @nbcchicago Good advice guvnuh. I mean, why aren't those ladies in a convent where they belong anyway? I need a drink...
721145670644551680 2016-04-15 01:18:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @nodamspam Hey facts are just tools of the evil establishment. Internet rags with grainy pictures of unaffiliated people are the REAL truth.
721144137714544640 2016-04-15 01:12:15 UTC <stlouisishome> @Fixer_guy Peace out
721143957946703872 2016-04-15 01:11:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @Fixer_guy @nodamspam @Forbes Yeah I heard. Last I checked Nixon is dead and we're talking about Hillary Clinton. Get a grip.
721141781421658113 2016-04-15 01:02:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @Fixer_guy I didn't see HRC in that pic. Any other random shit you'd like to blame her for? This is reaching "thanks Obama!" absurdity. GEEZ
721140386538725378 2016-04-15 00:57:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @Fixer_guy @nodamspam Cool story. I don't get my facts from Twitter conspiracy theorists. Carry on.
721139175169232896 2016-04-15 00:52:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @Fixer_guy @nodamspam I think it's pretty obvious I'm pointing out hypocrisy, not implying corruption like pure-as-snow Bernie does to HRC.
721122178121347072 2016-04-15 23:44:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @JTSantucci His nicknames all suck anyway. Not even catchy or clever. He just REPEATS them over and over and media runs with it as "news."
721121248684560384 2016-04-15 23:41:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @SInow It's a good thing he didn't play baseball... They only give you three strikes. How many does the NFL allow?
721119798634029056 2016-04-15 23:35:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @waltb31 @FiveThirtyEight You're just saying that because it's true!
721119398711300097 2016-04-15 23:33:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @nodamspam @thehill Ha! Damn right. The Sanders sure didn't turn down Jane's $200k golden parachute. Wonder why?
720838771571208193 2016-04-14 04:58:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill Mocking her says a lot.. just shows he can't top it. Remind me exactly what steps Bernie took to prevent collapse?
720837532338946048 2016-04-14 04:53:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @stellaaaa @TnGovern Typical glibertarian response. Everything is a joke.
720836691217354752 2016-04-14 04:50:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @SouthernRock3 She should remind voters that Cit United was about republicans' never-ending quest to bring her down. They won the battle...
720813836337438722 2016-04-14 03:19:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @dodi70 @JoyAnnReid Like a live action comment section.
720812165221916673 2016-04-14 03:13:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @kittycat_RN Damn I bet! I feel for you all in the medical field. Wish government would do a massive PSA about this.
720810815973031936 2016-04-14 03:07:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @kittycat_RN Same goes for grown up sniffles. I have to talk myself down every time someone tells me to get them for a cold. 
720809048573026304 2016-04-14 03:00:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @BCAppelbaum He's really good at waiting his turn.
720808716275027969 2016-04-14 02:59:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @Chicago6611 @bubblegenius I'm picturing Bernie with an eye-patch and it totally makes sense.
720802502963113984 2016-04-14 02:34:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @thefix @jonfavs @TheFix Despite Bernie's best efforts, dems are not angry at Obama or dems in Congress. We know who real enemies to progress are!
720665744376246272 2016-04-14 17:31:17 UTC <HillaryClinton> Donald Trump's made the most reckless statements on national security by any major candidate in modern history:http://nydn.us/1MwhTCg
720755259732205568 2016-04-14 23:26:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @b_random_sb Here is the Tribune story: https://www.texastribune.org/2015/09/22/amputee-fights-work-injury-denial/  This is what ins companies do when REPUBLICANS set the rules.
720753717960515584 2016-04-14 23:20:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @b_random_sb My point is while it's not perfect, I know many people who would kill to have ins as reliable as mine.
720753297515110400 2016-04-14 23:19:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @b_random_sb If you work for school districts, perhaps you've heard of Jane Hays of Temple ISD.  The Tribune did story on her.
720752797445021697 2016-04-14 23:17:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @b_random_sb I know how it works, I have AETNA through ACA. Sure I wish it were cheaper but so what? This is not equal to shameful WC system
720713872785547264 2016-04-14 20:42:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @RainierOunce That's why I drink mine through a silly straw.
720676033188352000 2016-04-14 18:12:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill I like Ghandi's take on it better "...will make the whole world blind."
720675640286949377 2016-04-14 18:10:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @mitchellreports @janeosanders @BernieSanders @MSNBC Cool story Jane. Tell us the one again about how tax returns vanish into thin air.
720643843574538240 2016-04-14 16:04:15 UTC <stlouisishome> @b_random_sb So spare me your lectures. I fight soulless insurance cos every day. What's your job?
720642688412884992 2016-04-14 15:59:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @b_random_sb I suggest you look into workers comp in Texas to see a real shameful ins. system. Texas Mutual makes AETNA look like saints.
720641965365178368 2016-04-14 15:56:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @b_random_sb No shit. It's also about my dad, my bf, coworkers, and millions of others now covered by ACA. But just pretend we don't exist.
720626930848915456 2016-04-14 14:57:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @BritTAnyDae @BrittanyDae @WyzeChef We have been propagandized so effectively by those who reap  benefits of our labor. It's like mass hypnosis.
720624772002893824 2016-04-14 14:48:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @ThePlumLineGS And he's not even done offending people.
720621958841282560 2016-04-14 14:37:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @alexweprin @cwarzel Just needs a handle.
720610238441791490 2016-04-14 13:50:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @paulysong @AttorneyCrump Those whores have done a lot for me. How many people have health insurance because of your actions? Zero?
720608707772461056 2016-04-14 13:44:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill They all deserve each other.
720602587381149699 2016-04-14 13:20:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @AndreaWNYC I saw a doctor yesterday. Used insurance purchased on exchange. But I guess that's not pure enough for these whiners.
720601936609681408 2016-04-14 13:17:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @franifusco @lukerebecchi @AndreaWNYC Ingrates. Guess they were never taught to appreciate what they have.
720601314065944576 2016-04-14 13:15:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @hotelkeys @ASDem So ungrateful and spoiled.
720600543639416833 2016-04-14 13:12:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @ClintSmithIII This is why I think republicans will never agree to end drug war. To them it is serving its purpose nicely.
720512962478370818 2016-04-14 07:24:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @HalloweenBlogs @djbratpack So true! He wouldn't dare. He'll only insult those he knows are too decent to insult back. Classic bully.
720510074926592001 2016-04-14 07:12:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @Only4RM So many Berniacs are ungrateful to those who have gone to the mat for them. Bernie camp has more backstabbing than a junior high.
720507542955274241 2016-04-14 07:02:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @toodeemo @saSophiaa @SDzzz Taking the Palin approach. All policy questions are just indicative of "gotcha" meanie journalists.
720500351053467648 2016-04-13 06:34:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @b_random_sb I chose my plan and pay for it. Allows me to keep my job working for injured workers. Consider myself fortunate & I don't whine
720498508579651585 2016-04-13 06:26:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @somalirosek @DebraMessing @paula_m_cuevas @MaryMcDonnell10 These oh-so-glib white boys feel entitled to tell others when to take offense.
720494205072707584 2016-04-13 06:09:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @PaulBegala @SenSanders @Key0fC @paulysong Frankly, he's had enough benefits of the doubt. Either he runs his campaign or he doesn't.
720493465679872000 2016-04-13 06:06:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @PaulBegala How many millennial Berniacs are covered by their parents' insurance thanks to the Democrats he trashes daily? So UNGRATEFUL.
720490980596690946 2016-04-13 05:56:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @PaulBegala @BernieSanders I'm expecting the usual excuses... and unfortunately media always seem to give him benefit of the doubt.
720489801774981120 2016-04-13 05:52:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @LiberalPhenom @Kat4Obama @paulysong In fact I saw my doctor today w/ no copay. This happened THANKS TO DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS, not purity BS
720485305715986433 2016-04-13 05:34:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @LiberalPhenom @Kat4Obama @paulysong @Shakestweetz The only reason I have health insurance is because of those "whores."
720470136717762560 2016-04-13 04:34:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @HankMobleyLives @RobynGillespi15 @CNN Perhaps he'll recover in true Trump style by insisting that some of his best friends are whores.
720246191838003201 2016-04-13 13:44:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @sahilkapur @bpolitics And good riddance to the party of fake economics and racism. When has electing them ever turned out well for us?
720114513572413440 2016-04-12 05:00:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @Valhallagrrl @yottapoint Second that! Looks like a winner 
720108476958142464 2016-04-12 04:36:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @allanbrauer @MattBruenig Yes we were all clamoring for this. So honored he's has taken time to share his "thoughts" with us.

719667855017422848 2016-04-11 23:26:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @GiGicmka @ninaturner Good question!
719568005328273409 2016-04-11 16:49:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @cshirky @docrocktex26 Facts and numbers are so pesky.
719540763571257344 2016-04-11 15:01:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @GideonResnick @thedailybeast Freudian slip?
719539483767508992 2016-04-11 14:55:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @KevinDarryl @dailykos We cannot keep going backwards! How does John Roberts explain this happening in his post-VRA world?
719536977779904512 2016-04-11 14:45:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @garyldeaton Guess they're too busy salivating over contrived Clinton scandals. Bernie says he's beyond reproach and they believe it!
719528710739599360 2016-04-11 14:13:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @ProgressMich @truthout Can't wait til this asshole is behind bars.
719430507251916800 2016-04-11 07:42:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @mmfa @mcspocky I used to work for a hotel... they DO NOT tolerate threats like this to their guests.
719428811356385280 2016-04-11 07:36:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @HuffingtonPost @LittleThingsUSA His little tail wagging when he won was too cute!
719427244699963393 2016-04-11 07:29:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @lucille_fer @ageistewart Thank you!  They are the heart of rape culture in our country.
719334742714241024 2016-04-10 01:22:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @jbouie Republicans clearly understand this... why else would they work so hard to disenfranchise?
719322497934430208 2016-04-10 00:33:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @AndyRichter @mattyglesias This is utterly nauseating. Hope he sees swift justice and rots in prison rest of his miserable life.
719317315087564800 2016-04-10 00:13:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @EtreEtro Their tears are delicious.
719316991857676289 2016-04-10 00:11:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @NICKinNOVA No kidding. I have many friends in same boat. (I work at a law firm but not a lawyer.) I feel for you.
719315905864294401 2016-04-10 00:07:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @TIME @MONEY Whoopty shit. Let us know when he becomes a real grown up.

719303857604407296 2016-04-10 23:19:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @NICKinNOVA Damn! Wishing you the best of luck!
719302502064074752 2016-04-10 23:14:15 UTC <stlouisishome> @avengingmomgel @timjhogan No kidding! Are there any bridges he hasn't burned?
719301937879846912 2016-04-10 23:12:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @NICKinNOVA @CNBC Knee-slapper! Don't know many people my age with $$$ for a down payment w/o help from mommy and daddy.
719300662903709696 2016-04-10 23:06:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @HuffPostPol Why can't republicans ever name their laws honestly? Always this Orwellian garbage. They think we're too stupid to see through.
719300257142562816 2016-04-10 23:05:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @HuffPostPol Sorry Scott... I know it sucks to find out that workers have rights!
719293547292151808 2016-04-10 22:38:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @fantasticfemme "Just quietly accept the tyranny of the majority!"

719260846203871232 2016-04-10 20:28:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @freespeak3 @FoxNewsSunday Sorry, does anyone like Karl Rove? I bet even his dog thinks he's an asshole.
719199150500237312 2016-04-10 16:23:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @MichaelWolffNYC @repubblicait Apparently you speak Italian. 
719192239625244672 2016-04-10 15:56:06 UTC <stlouisishome> @Nadomom No problem. :)

719026098177114112 2016-04-09 04:55:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @LaDemos @NOLAnews Wonderful news!! Amazing what happens when a governor believes  government should work for its people. 
719024718255263744 2016-04-09 04:50:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @GeauxGabby Cute stuff! Thanks for sharing!
718945827444563968 2016-04-09 23:36:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @finneyk @MrsRochesterNY @kzaleski Didn't ya know? Only Bernie is allowed nuance. Being Bernie means never having to say you're sorry.
718944277410123776 2016-04-09 23:30:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @MSNBC Behold the face of a pathetic coward! Just like Snyder, McCrory and all the other republican dirtbag governors...
718941497488384000 2016-04-09 23:19:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @ActDontReact I was there and the air was electric and full of HOPE, not contrived cynicism.
718940346470703104 2016-04-09 23:15:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @AbortionFunds @AllAboveAll It's time to stop appeasing anti-abortion extremists. Medical decisions are none of Paul Ryan's business.

718936521303203841 2016-04-09 22:59:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @thehill I guess she'd like to fail at something else?
718916297782734848 2016-04-09 21:39:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @PamSchep @nanlupien @Lee_in_Iowa NPR has been just as bad as tv news in the Bernie cheerleading.

718840863636324352 2016-04-09 16:39:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @riotwomennn @RiotWomennn Par for the course. I guess having integrity is for the establishment.
718840034946777089 2016-04-09 16:36:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @VikramParalkar It's working!

718831675556257792 2016-04-09 16:03:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @Forbes What a colossal waste of money, and so much is just for vanity to prove keeping up with the Joneses.
718199368130514945 2016-04-07 22:10:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @MMonides I think the hissing was what haunted me the most.
718198208304779265 2016-04-07 22:06:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @MMonides I blame Canada.
718194008061706240 2016-04-07 21:49:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @MMonides Both! They stole my bread too. Geese are kinda jerks.
718186962054619136 2016-04-07 21:21:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @metaquest @POTUS @SenateMajLdr Huh? Sorry, I don't speak turtle.
717949940287143936 2016-04-06 05:39:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnMonch @Karoli Republicans and industry  built a narrative that protecting workers is bad for jobs. They even convinced many workers.
717947280368603136 2016-04-06 05:29:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @JohnMonch @Karoli I can tell you I work in workers comp and every day workers face new obstacles and lose resources to fight back.
717940381476741120 2016-04-06 05:01:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @missiongirl4 @owillis It's this crazy thing called "chronological order." At least she has a LIST.
717720932681297920 2016-04-06 14:29:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @cp2austin She's also sharing the $$ with other dems. Not Bernie! He's far too pure for that. 
717137051703910400 2016-04-04 23:49:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis Same! And we didn't complain about not being "excited" by Kerry. Most Dems I knew were simply too exhausted by Bush war and lies.
716982881503961088 2016-04-04 13:36:54 UTC <stlouisishome> @femme_esq Is there such a thing as a part-time revolutionary?
716478510299090944 2016-04-02 04:12:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @Tyler_Tortoise @Picassokat I'm thinking Tad Devine had grown bitter after all those losses... gone to his head.
716478022212190208 2016-04-02 04:10:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @Tyler_Tortoise @Picassokat This is true. Good point.
716477616908161024 2016-04-02 04:09:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @Picassokat @Tyler_Tortoise He is not a crook!
716476645427716097 2016-04-02 04:05:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @ComfortablySmug Yeah usually if I say "let's finish this later," it means "let's never watch this again." 
716407958972686336 2016-04-02 23:32:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @GareBearEsq It gives him plausible deniability but NRA typically flunks anyone who even that hints guns DO KILL PEOPLE.
716407811530293248 2016-04-02 23:31:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @MattMurph24 In other words, Hillary is the only one. If situations were reversed, what would pundits be saying? Tired of double standards.
716130980386320384 2016-04-01 05:11:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @revmagdalen @buddhika1987 What is it about women standing up for themselves that is so threatening?
716130310316920832 2016-04-01 05:09:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @buddhika1987 @revmagdalen Are you proud of yourself? You sound like Trump.

715990095212449797 2016-04-01 19:51:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @guardian Ah yes I remember, I had the lasagna.
715980329815658496 2016-04-01 19:13:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @charles_gaba @ThePlumLineGS Truth is, companies give money to ALL viable candidates as a way to "hedge their bets." No guarantee of return.

715716605905272832 2016-03-31 01:45:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @KaraCalavera @DebraMessing @HillaryClinton I voted for her and all I got was the satisfaction of voting for the first woman POTUS.
715305872277184512 2016-03-30 22:33:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @ladeyday @christinawilkie Then you know it must be bad if he's more repetitive than usual.

715087271028858880 2016-03-30 08:04:25 UTC <stlouisishome> @BadExampleMan @AJEnglish And written by someone who works for Jacobin magazine. Weren't they best known for chopping off heads? I'll pass.
715085333944078336 2016-03-30 07:56:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @AJEnglish Lots of WOMEN disagree. (Females? Really??)
715037355711807491 2016-03-29 04:46:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @OnPointRadio @NortinHadlerMD And yet many of us can't afford not to have it.
715004626857107456 2016-03-29 02:36:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @FrankLuntz @DemFromCT @Reince Of course not. If RNC intervenes he will run as third party and continue his campaign as it is.
714981325883572225 2016-03-29 01:03:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @cynical_tutu @JillFilipovic They're happy to let us little people fight and suffer their revolution for them. She wouldn't break a nail.
714481972865675264 2016-03-28 15:59:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @BostonJerry @HomoHulk We've been brainwashed to worship the wealthy, that they know better than us. Hence Trump.
714464289550020609 2016-03-28 14:48:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @brownandbella I sometimes wonder how a min wage based on ratio of pay instead of strict dollar amount would work.
714304438140178432 2016-03-27 04:13:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @mataliandy So true. Anyone who dared question rationale was fired/silenced, their patriotism openly questioned. Shameful.

714255087929917440 2016-03-27 00:57:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @CNNPolitics Ron Johnson knows blunders because he is one. He's free to go to Iraq after November if he's so concerned. Chickenhawk.
714254462638886912 2016-03-27 00:55:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @CNNPolitics Ron Johnson is a pathetic LIAR and will be gone soon. Can't wait to have Feingold back in Senate.
714251819187212288 2016-03-27 00:44:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @BronzeHammer @BobbyBigWheel Are you sure it wasn't Ted Cruz?
714247102595858432 2016-03-27 00:25:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @KaivanShroff Really irks me that he never seems to blame Bushes or Reagan for econ inequality, union busting, wars... All Bill's fault.
714243089443913728 2016-03-27 00:09:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @GeauxGabby @curlyheadRED Seriously something about that guy. Always smirking. Blech.
714241179026468864 2016-03-27 00:02:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @SeanMcElwee I hope @CNN and @MSNBC see this so they can stop playing dumb about why white southern men vote Trump. So afraid to say racism.
714184224270471169 2016-03-27 20:16:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @KStreetHipster @morningmoneyben I do blame pundits for pandering to them. I keep hearing "these are good people" "legitimate anger." BS!
714178629786206208 2016-03-27 19:53:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @akacharleswade WTF? Sad to say but if parents don't act, restaurant management should.
714177017109815297 2016-03-27 19:47:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @IowaPeg Damn. No excuses there.

714124974626197507 2016-03-27 16:20:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @Reince Whatever you say dude. How's that dysfunctional family of weasels and bigots you call the GOP faring?
714122267173609473 2016-03-27 16:09:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @RawStory Good for DeNiro.
714111179904258048 2016-03-27 15:25:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @dangillmor I'll never forget how pathetic they were in run-up to the Iraq war. Complete failure. Deferred to Bush admin and neocon lies.

713400016530907137 2016-03-25 16:19:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @MattMurph24 I wish I could pretend republicans don't exist either.
713398073297227778 2016-03-25 16:12:09 UTC <stlouisishome> @CNN So maybe it's time to put a stop to it or nah?
713390876450381825 2016-03-25 15:43:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @Clarknt67 @UpshotNYT Republicans ruined the brand of capitalism by praising and rewarding monopoly and corporate plunder.

713384613939273730 2016-03-25 15:18:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @AdamsFlaFan @washingtonpost Women are only useful when they can contribute to his insatiable vanity.
713255334995845120 2016-03-24 06:44:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 I am biketose intolerant.
713253095652728833 2016-03-24 06:36:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @MrDane1982 I guess they just don't give a shit that some of us are a SCOTUS decision away from theocracy. NC and IN anyone?
713132704338841600 2016-03-24 22:37:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @ericboehler @EricBoehler This is why I'm almost as worried about reaction to Donald losing as I am of Trump winning. Imagine a Trump concession speech?
712866694738407424 2016-03-23 05:00:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @hippieswordfish Sounds legit.
712865692522057728 2016-03-23 04:56:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @HeerJeet "Springtime for Donald"
712865483083628544 2016-03-23 04:55:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @HeerJeet I keep dreaming that this is a massive pageant to expose and destroy the Republican party. But the violence is too real.
712864257377968128 2016-03-23 04:50:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @RawStory "Hold my beer."
712860287137943553 2016-03-23 04:35:11 UTC <stlouisishome> @RawStory Outrageous these lawmakers thought they could get away with this. Unacceptable.
712826409861787648 2016-03-23 02:20:34 UTC <stlouisishome> @AdamsFlaFan Pathetic. No shame.
712824778764103680 2016-03-23 02:14:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @tomservo10 I bet you hear loud swishing when he walks.
712824573767524352 2016-03-23 02:13:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @AriBerman @DRobCO They are not even hiding their motives anymore. Proud racists.
712823837700726784 2016-03-23 02:10:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @USATODAY @arizonarepublic Maybe examine what caused poll shortage in first place? I'll give you a hint... Republicans.
712795140096532480 2016-03-23 00:16:19 UTC <stlouisishome> @Plantflowes Excuse me while I go chug a fifth of vodka. These people are so fucking insufferable. Maybe she should just mime.
712775682720280576 2016-03-23 22:59:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @CBS4Indy @onetoughnerd Hey Snyder, there's a set of handcuffs with your name on them somewhere. And they don't serve Perrier in prison.
712771893179232256 2016-03-23 22:43:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis Gee you wonder how he gets it all in.
712458616054239232 2016-03-22 01:59:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @theonlyadult @realDonaldTrump Speechless.
712454622800052224 2016-03-22 01:43:13 UTC <stlouisishome> @nbcwashington She sure does love being on those lamestream media networks.
712386062547492864 2016-03-22 21:10:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @thinkprogress They would probably recommend privatizing the court to "save $$." Welcome Chief Justice ExxonMobil!
712159554998394880 2016-03-21 06:10:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @Tyler_Tortoise I know it's an overused expression, but I truly cannot tell parody from reality anymore.
711801924941557760 2016-03-20 06:29:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @susanbrandon96 @Only4RM Same... Reminds me of when I was a teenager and learned "gyp" was a slur. Had no idea but grew my awareness after.
711800605254127616 2016-03-20 06:24:23 UTC <stlouisishome> @Only4RM This is what separates YOU from others who would dig in and not recognize an opportunity to learn and reassess.
711688622433415168 2016-03-20 22:59:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @RaisingOneBrow @thehill Do they teach journalists how to fabricate crises now?
711611126404947968 2016-03-20 17:51:28 UTC <stlouisishome> @notnotalexv @NPR I like On Point w/ Tom Ashbrook. @OnPointRadio
711609665436516352 2016-03-20 17:45:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @Kris_Sacrebleu @YouTube Nice!
711588618272280576 2016-03-20 16:22:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @PatrickRuffini @RadioFreeTom Despite being quite devout, they strongly value education.
711562150423060481 2016-03-20 14:36:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @theonlyadult They don't really understand political strategy is a real thing. Nuance is so hard...
711216189582626816 2016-03-19 15:42:08 UTC <stlouisishome> @samswey Maybe he'll grow a beard
710315706940674048 2016-03-16 04:03:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @AdamPlatt1999 @ZekeJMiller Some votes are more equal than others.
710020885390893056 2016-03-16 08:32:25 UTC <stlouisishome> @eclecticbrotha Spot on.
709998929044217857 2016-03-16 07:05:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @Plantflowes Nice to know even when you run for president, assholes will still tell you to smile and be quiet.
709581961463857152 2016-03-14 03:28:17 UTC <stlouisishome> @theyoooooshow @JeanneFischer33 @janeosanders Heh.
709581654344470528 2016-03-14 03:27:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @ajjaffe @mmurraypolitics Still in the bubble.
709576303976980480 2016-03-14 03:05:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @stoptrumppac @StopTrumpPAC Respect.
709556231178833921 2016-03-14 01:46:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @cam_joseph @ChrisChristie Take note Trumpers: this is how he treats his "friends." Imagine the contempt he has for you.
709438619077881856 2016-03-14 17:58:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @Maggyw519 Cynicism for the sake of cynicism... it's the crutch of the pseudo-intellectual.
709436834334384128 2016-03-14 17:51:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @Reince Yes this is much more important than figuring how to stop your party's descent into fascism.
709193324528148480 2016-03-13 01:43:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @HeerJeet Republicans are stuck with racists. They can't campaign on their economic or foreign policies, where they have utterly failed.
709102007194226688 2016-03-13 19:41:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @JoeNBC @rolandsmartin Nope. As always, republicans will be on the wrong side of history.
709064529615806464 2016-03-13 17:12:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @ZekeJMiller @chucktodd Sounds like Spinal Tap... "I believe literally everything I read."
709060335924162560 2016-03-13 16:55:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @jbarro Stuck in traffic?
708683762981150720 2016-03-12 15:59:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @milojbloom @krf7 @davidgrayrhodes Kafka would be proud.
708682638794428417 2016-03-12 15:54:42 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis They've never tried to shed their racism. They hide behind (im)plausible deniability they know the media will never question.
708462432834859008 2016-03-11 01:19:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @mattdpearce We are not afraid!
708177711810752516 2016-03-10 06:28:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @FeministaJones I find often this just means "women who agree with me."
708172517479809025 2016-03-10 06:07:40 UTC <stlouisishome> @jenabcxyz @TheEconomist You and your actual math and numbers.
708156209686163456 2016-03-10 05:02:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @KimberlyNFoster Living the dream!
708149463588548608 2016-03-10 04:36:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @jbarro Their debates should air with a parental warning.
708148755413872640 2016-03-10 04:33:14 UTC <stlouisishome> @JesseLehrich Sick and scary.
707949980208607232 2016-03-10 15:23:23 UTC <stlouisishome> @YahooNews Is he reuniting with family he molested or the family he apparently hasn't molested?
707949756534771712 2016-03-10 15:22:29 UTC <stlouisishome> @YahooNews Should be in prison.
707949553757003776 2016-03-10 15:21:41 UTC <stlouisishome> @OnPointRadio @SeanTrende Media fantasy.
707948945293467648 2016-03-10 15:19:16 UTC <stlouisishome> @ZeeshanAleem @MSNBC About time!
707423891249979392 2016-03-08 04:32:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @jpodhoretz @drvox Castro still the better choice.  He is what dems want for the future.
707423457621843968 2016-03-08 04:31:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @eean @drvox @jpodhoretz These two are perfect examples of why nepotism is stupid. Bush Jr. makes it 3.
707422885552324608 2016-03-08 04:28:53 UTC <stlouisishome> @drvox @jpodhoretz He knows less about politics than I thought. It's Castro by a mile.
707408699841613824 2016-03-08 03:32:31 UTC <stlouisishome> @calatayud7 @maysoonzayid @MSNBC @HillaryClinton Yeah it's her fault he never shuts the fuck up.
707390994396766208 2016-03-08 02:22:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @Ed_Samaniego @wendydavis We're with you! Bigotry always loses.
706715072786116609 2016-03-06 05:36:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @jashsf @owillis Ah I see. Also did you see how short her skirt was?
706714398174281729 2016-03-06 05:33:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @jashsf @owillis Mo Dowd?
706713184468541440 2016-03-06 05:28:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis You have never lied.
706343196557578240 2016-03-05 04:58:35 UTC <stlouisishome> @GrooveSDC I've been re-enjoying Alice in Chains lately. Good stuff.
706291813770883072 2016-03-05 01:34:25 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 And cars that exploded on impact.
706289915412160513 2016-03-05 01:26:52 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Just like now they use Uber and see no issue running well-paid union, career cabbies out of business.
706287685065773057 2016-03-05 01:18:00 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 So easy to lob bombs from the sidelines. When you don't/can't win you don't have to be held responsible for anything.
705232945993224192 2016-03-02 03:26:51 UTC <stlouisishome> @ericafesuluai @auntbec15 #2!
705225386964054020 2016-03-02 02:56:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @KXAN_News I hope I never see this POS again.
705222644270956544 2016-03-02 02:45:55 UTC <stlouisishome> @carolynedgar @NYDailyNews Now I'm sad.
704859379300892672 2016-03-01 02:42:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @metaquest He's so much smarter than them and they just can't stand it.
704173102029152256 2016-02-28 05:15:25 UTC <stlouisishome> @diggaduh New agent?
704171851610632193 2016-02-28 05:10:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis Loved him in Departed. Great cast all-around.
704170467741945856 2016-02-28 05:04:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @RalstonReports Second this!
704162950748049408 2016-02-28 04:35:04 UTC <stlouisishome> @Shakestweetz The defenders Roman Polanski make me sick.
704142142411681793 2016-02-28 03:12:23 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 I hope not for long?
704141742073745409 2016-02-28 03:10:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @MiaFarrow @llywalker Together we will win!
703823571886276608 2016-02-27 06:06:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @gryking @GRYKING Ironically, rather elitist.
703765757893607424 2016-02-27 02:16:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Had PETA endorsed yet?
703764419726036992 2016-02-27 02:11:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @jeffray49 @AdamsFlaFan @chrysta10 We know Trey Gowdy has made it his primary goal to bring her down. Not fooled by contrived "scandals."
703763185531166720 2016-02-27 02:06:33 UTC <stlouisishome> @aterkel @HuffPostPol What a dirtbag.
703748604964376577 2016-02-27 01:08:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Clinton derangement syndrome.
703747343422623744 2016-02-27 01:03:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @armandodkos @word_34 Haven't you heard? Now it's running up the score.
703747106024980480 2016-02-27 01:02:39 UTC <stlouisishome> @shae_dog Glad I can cry at home in privacy.
703744247321657344 2016-02-27 00:51:18 UTC <stlouisishome> @Clarknt67 @HillaryClinton No question. And I can't wait til he's VP!
703739822494515200 2016-02-27 00:33:43 UTC <stlouisishome> @Aubs89 We do now!
703644641753583616 2016-02-27 18:15:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @RockyinTX @MSNBC "Big tent" How does she say this shit with a straight face?
703642350770237440 2016-02-27 18:06:24 UTC <stlouisishome> @BroderickGreer I knew young journalists who had to build a TV career making $10 an hour (!!!) reporting for local stations. This guy...
703641201308626944 2016-02-27 18:01:50 UTC <stlouisishome> @BroderickGreer @WilGafney THANK YOU
703590417862766592 2016-02-27 14:40:02 UTC <stlouisishome> @Lee_in_Iowa @DemFromCT I thought they were always out to lunch.
703057391437246466 2016-02-25 03:21:58 UTC <stlouisishome> @harveyjkaye That counts as cereal.
702858107194478594 2016-02-25 14:10:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis Yeah they seem real nice.
702736573788344320 2016-02-24 06:07:10 UTC <stlouisishome> @stltoday What needs to happen to expand historical preservation to all wards? These vultures will tear down anything for short term profit.
702717847831650306 2016-02-24 04:52:45 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis @Slate Gee, ya know who *else* liked Austria...?
702717642797232128 2016-02-24 04:51:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @owillis @Slate Seems legit.

702635573970776064 2016-02-24 23:25:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @MattMurph24 @AdamsFlaFan @Salon Some of us live in states where the only thing separating us from theocracy is the federal government.
702632440708276225 2016-02-24 23:13:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @NYDailyNews This hurts.

702564765835497472 2016-02-24 18:44:27 UTC <stlouisishome> @PragObots It's obvious he is not one of the groups targeted by Trump and his voters. So easy to be magnanimous...
702563380804980736 2016-02-24 18:38:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @EmoNegro1 No kidding. Maybe they should hire someone who does if they're that dense. It's pretty damn obvious out here.

702538928897720320 2016-02-24 17:01:47 UTC <stlouisishome> @SouthernRock3 @emptywheel I believe this is sarcasm... 
702384823453745155 2016-02-23 06:49:26 UTC <stlouisishome> @jbouie I'm genuinely worried about how his supporters will react to a loss.
702371785849880576 2016-02-23 05:57:37 UTC <stlouisishome> @MattGertz Good lord. I may never stop throwing up.

701563462493704192 2016-02-21 00:25:38 UTC <stlouisishome> @eclecticbrotha @goldietaylor I think I actually cringed reading it.
701560935895293952 2016-02-21 00:15:36 UTC <stlouisishome> @bluejoni @AP My initial reaction exactly. Sad that that behavior is apparently considered normal.
701546941352521728 2016-02-21 23:19:59 UTC <stlouisishome> @Marmel @Rschooley Why only outrage when it happens to them? Rest of time too many pundits hide behind "well, voters are angry..." BS.
701282807046213632 2016-02-20 05:50:25 UTC <stlouisishome> @speechboy71 I share your skepticism. Trump hasn't even begun to tear into him. He will.
701270378673385472 2016-02-20 05:01:01 UTC <stlouisishome> @Kris_Sacrebleu @YouTube Nice.

699004178115350528 2016-02-14 22:55:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @crazypastor Dave Barry once said a person who is nice to you but rude to the waiter is not a good person. 100% truth.
699001765232922624 2016-02-14 22:46:22 UTC <stlouisishome> @gregpinelo @HuffPostPol Just precious. I'd rather have an actual lame duck as president.

698332525995765760 2016-02-12 02:27:03 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 Thanks. I think Bernie has it backwards... racism is primarily what prevents agendas like his from ever having a chance.
698325417908801536 2016-02-12 01:58:48 UTC <stlouisishome> @Gus_802 If taxes on the rich and a large middle class = no racism, how to  explain the 1950s?

695992936236855296 2016-02-06 15:30:21 UTC <stlouisishome> @Lynn_Henning @MMSWaz @SenWarren @LisaToddSutton Yes, like children we reject what we don't want to hear. Prefer to be pandered to.

695990264020611072 2016-02-06 15:19:44 UTC <stlouisishome> @Kennymack1971 Bernie would bang his fist on the podium a few times and the GOP would back down. Or something.
695989061647888384 2016-02-06 15:14:57 UTC <stlouisishome> @washingtonpost It doesn't "skew democracy" so much as it blatantly disenfranchises.

695882137896034304 2016-02-06 08:10:05 UTC <stlouisishome> @WhiskeyInSpace @JudyReardon Ironic, since winning down-ticket races is the only way to accomplish anything substantial in Congress.
695871830582652928 2016-02-05 07:29:07 UTC <stlouisishome> @mackromackro @Maggyw519 I recently tried to rediscover mIRC. Ran screaming.

695857901949157376 2016-02-05 06:33:46 UTC <stlouisishome> @onetoughnerd @SBAgov Despicable. You are beneath contempt.
695855146182406144 2016-02-05 06:22:49 UTC <stlouisishome> @RawStory Thanks Texas! Another winner.
695849386367037440 2016-02-05 05:59:56 UTC <stlouisishome> @onetoughnerd You're going to love prison. It's VERY austere.
695849200710340608 2016-02-05 05:59:12 UTC <stlouisishome> @onetoughnerd Get bent. Then go to prison.
695848984959561728 2016-02-05 05:58:20 UTC <stlouisishome> @judystrollo @dailykos Good call. Privatize the source of all life. Water is only good for fracking anyway, right?
695846508902518784 2016-02-05 05:48:30 UTC <stlouisishome> @NBCNews Is this a chlamydia joke?

695466010317467648 2016-02-04 04:36:32 UTC <stlouisishome> @stltoday Didn't anyone tell Kroenke he's as popular as bubonic plague in STL? Let him go beg LA for money.
