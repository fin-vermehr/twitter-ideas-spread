Not just with the hospitals, but also LA County jails, which are the countrys largest mental health institution thanks to Reagans deregulation of the mental health system both as Calif. govenor & president. At least there is now a federal consent decree w/LASD to stop it.

936699767693885440 2017-12-01 20:53:22 UTC <gidgetgurl> @latguild Issues aside, I loved my time @ TCN. I'm still in contact w/many former colleagues. It was my first full-time news job after J-school. I learned so much. Best training ground for budding reporters. Only because I loved reporting & was so invested in the work did I stay that long.
936698565098737664 2017-12-01 20:48:35 UTC <gidgetgurl> @latguild Oh and additionally, we never had shared bylines or contribution credits in those articles.
936698230611492864 2017-12-01 20:47:15 UTC <gidgetgurl> @latguild I hope these are still not issues & if they are, I hope you are able to negotiate them. Another issue I ran into was that I lost all seniority when I moved to the Leader. I had been with TCN for more than a year. But they treated me as "new" - meaning, holiday assignments & more.
936696246047195137 2017-12-01 20:39:22 UTC <gidgetgurl> @latguild When I was a reporter for the Burbank Leader, I also had to write stories for the Glendale News Press, and sometimes cover weekend shifts for GNP reporters for stories that only ran in GNP. GNP reporters made more than Leader reporters. More disparity.
936695857805647872 2017-12-01 20:37:50 UTC <gidgetgurl> @latguild I was forced to share sources, quotes and other information with LA Times reporters (when there was still a Valley edition) if we were both working on the same story. They got paid twice as much as me, and I had to give them my work, but not the other way around. Total disparity.
936695556029652992 2017-12-01 20:36:38 UTC <gidgetgurl> @latguild I had an editor tell me: You're going to have to quit your second job because we MAY need you on the weekends. I went ballistic. Called in management. I won that argument. As long as I'm given enough time, I could change my schedule with the 2nd job, which was retail.
936695120241373184 2017-12-01 20:34:54 UTC <gidgetgurl> I spent 3 yrs as a TCN reporter @ the Pilot, Our Times Conejo & Burbank Leader, which required me to also write for GNP. Lots of issues back then. We were always the red-headed step kids of the LA Times. And most of the time I had a 2nd weekend job. You have my support! @latguildhttps://twitter.com/anthonyjpesce/status/936689876702916608

915038614588866560 2017-10-02 02:19:40 UTC <gidgetgurl> @EdKrassen @dave_landman13 Given the whole well-regulated militia part. How would a registry infringe?
915036436943872000 2017-10-02 02:11:01 UTC <gidgetgurl> @EdKrassen @dave_landman13 Thinking about this one on the drive home. 2A says you have a right & govt can't infringe those rights. Doesn't address any limit though.

915024878809448448 2017-10-02 01:25:06 UTC <gidgetgurl> @EdKrassen @dave_landman13 We continue 2 grapple w/this issue: How do you not infringe rights but protect society? If lobbyists on all sides went away, that's a start.
915023882817388545 2017-10-02 01:21:08 UTC <gidgetgurl> @EdKrassen @dave_landman13 Yes. And most of those are at gun shows with no checks at all, right?

915011953008844800 2017-10-02 00:33:44 UTC <gidgetgurl> @EdKrassen @my2guns Obviously, there's no number. But do you think it was written to allow someone to purchase an arsenal to kill innocent people? I don't.
914953141413539840 2017-10-02 20:40:02 UTC <gidgetgurl> @EdKrassen Why does anybody need 19 weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition? That's not what the Second Amendment guarantees.

904368228134043648 2017-09-03 15:39:22 UTC <gidgetgurl> Our Police Chief is Scott LaChasse. Our Fire Chief is Tom Lenahan. I know LA city fire area has more acreage burned but please be accurate.
904366889618489344 2017-09-03 15:34:03 UTC <gidgetgurl> Our Mayor is Will Rogers, who used to be a columnist for the Burbank Leader. You should talk to him about Burbank - not Garcetti. Thx.
904366351841501184 2017-09-03 15:31:55 UTC <gidgetgurl> So stop calling us the city of LA. We are proud of our city - low crime, good schools and even lower utility bills (cuz we're not DWP).
904365400774762496 2017-09-03 15:28:08 UTC <gidgetgurl> Dear reporters covering #LaTunaFire: #Burbank is a city w/its own police, fire, mayor & city council. Please stop looping us in w/Garcetti.
904362051870482432 2017-09-03 15:14:50 UTC <gidgetgurl> @ericgarcetti @Variety Also, the studios are on the opposite side of city where the Verdugos are. No where near the fires or threatened by them in any way.
904361647107485698 2017-09-03 15:13:13 UTC <gidgetgurl> @ericgarcetti @Variety #Burbank, where Warner Bros. & Disney are located, is NOT in the city of LA and Garcetti is NOT our mayor. Stick to entertainment reporting.

902030387936870400 2017-08-27 04:49:38 UTC <gidgetgurl> @RogueLeaderLA I say let them go. One bad season and they want to bolt to a team that hasn't even played one game? Those aren't fans. Those are posers.

902011066992926720 2017-08-27 03:32:51 UTC <gidgetgurl> @LAGalaxy Nobody had any issue with LA Galaxy being LA with their FIVE MLS CUPS. But now that hipster fake Chivas LAFC is coming, they're not LA? BS.
902010787702571008 2017-08-27 03:31:44 UTC <gidgetgurl> @LAGalaxy So, again, with your argument, then Chargers and Rams should be called Inglewood, right? Becuz Inglewood is its own city, not LA, FYI.
902006930507304961 2017-08-27 03:16:25 UTC <gidgetgurl> @LAGalaxy Prior to new home for Rams & Chargers, it was Hollywood Park. Not even close to Hollywood, which is LA City proper.
902006726056067072 2017-08-27 03:15:36 UTC <gidgetgurl> @LAGalaxy Garbage argument. Rams & Chargers stadium in Inglewood. Guess they should change their name to Inglewood Rams. Inglewood Chargers right?
902005476329627648 2017-08-27 03:10:38 UTC <gidgetgurl> @LAGalaxy I'm a native Angeleno son. My fam's been here since the mid-1800s. If you have a team that is LA. It's more than just the city of LA.
902001557113159680 2017-08-27 02:55:04 UTC <gidgetgurl> @LAGalaxy Carson is in LA County. LA is more than just DTLA. I suspect most hipster LAFC fans aren't native Angelenos so they're clueless of this fact

891684300126539776 2017-07-30 15:37:58 UTC <gidgetgurl> @MrjSykes I cringe every game looking at that garbage that has taken over the lovely grassy hillside. And now they have more metal junk behind LARS.
891678289344905216 2017-07-30 15:14:05 UTC <gidgetgurl> My cousins in Scotland do not like Drumpf and they do not consider him kin. He's swindled them & lied to them to build shitty golf courses.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/891677442036903936

891677274822524929 2017-07-30 15:10:03 UTC <gidgetgurl> @LAGalaxy You poured concrete where a lawn used to be. How is that not permanent? The caged area looks like a prison rec yard. It's ugly & uninviting.

888845444901552128 2017-07-22 19:37:22 UTC <gidgetgurl> Amazing how a dude w/out any comm dir experience, just a seedy #WallStreet career, can get a job that some of us have MA degrees in.

776948683401105408 2016-09-16 00:59:35 UTC <gidgetgurl> @KAABOODELMAR we didn't spend $120 4 VIP parking to wait in traffic 2 enter with everyone & deal with staff who have NO IDEA WHERE WE PARK.
