965420481338802177 2018-02-18 02:59:14 UTC <chadbraunduin> Also, the song choices are Despacito or another song if you are some sort of weirdo.
965418861276344322 2018-02-18 02:52:47 UTC <chadbraunduin> The ice dancing competition pits Michigan's finest, representing countries of the world (who are all coached by the same person) against each other.
965417760812650501 2018-02-18 02:48:25 UTC <chadbraunduin> Ok, scratch that. After some googling, there have already been 14!? films in the Air Bud canon. So we're good.
965417758254039041 2018-02-18 02:48:24 UTC <chadbraunduin> They need to do an Air Bud reboot where the dog is a snowboarder.

964682156734853125 2018-02-16 02:05:23 UTC <chadbraunduin> @BuckyIsotope I throw sort of a knuckle ball bullet. Not that effective but it it keeps them guessing.

962896096212250624 2018-02-11 03:48:13 UTC <chadbraunduin> Of course brandishing a firearm during league play does go against many of the league's by laws.
962895620305510402 2018-02-11 03:46:20 UTC <chadbraunduin> My ice dancing routine would definitely be based off of The Big Lebowski.
962886574307532800 2018-02-11 03:10:23 UTC <chadbraunduin> Mike Tirico is far better at interviewing Olympic athletes than anyone else at NBC.
962819573945896964 2018-02-11 22:44:09 UTC <chadbraunduin> My description of the Norwegian curling uniform is discotheque on the bottom, deconstructed doily on top.
962758691895304193 2018-02-11 18:42:13 UTC <chadbraunduin> One of Canada's major exports is curling coaches.
962323298855149568 2018-02-10 13:52:08 UTC <chadbraunduin> I love that there is a ski jumping category called "normal hill".
962168461739872256 2018-02-09 03:36:52 UTC <chadbraunduin> While this drone video plays the people in the stadium are listening to the Korean folk singers do "I am the Walrus". #Olympics
961450303987109902 2018-02-07 04:03:10 UTC <chadbraunduin> @13spencer Canada in curling
960737519049551872 2018-02-05 04:50:48 UTC <chadbraunduin> Obviously there are major problems with football that have been well documented. But the overall fan experience is continuously improving in spite of what we may all feel about Goodell. That was certainly on display last night. That is all.
960737515228581889 2018-02-05 04:50:47 UTC <chadbraunduin> The list could go on and on. I think our hypothetical fan who stopped watching after 1995 and who then watched last night's Super Bowl would be shocked be how different (and generally better) the game is now.
960737511424364545 2018-02-05 04:50:47 UTC <chadbraunduin> Far more competent clock and time management. This is now a mostly solved problem (Oh, hi Andy Reed).
960737507079049216 2018-02-05 04:50:45 UTC <chadbraunduin> Smaller pads and much tighter uniforms. Watching replays from the past makes it look like the players are wearing space suits.
960737502637240321 2018-02-05 04:50:44 UTC <chadbraunduin> Quarterbacks who complete over 60% of their throws.
960737499688718336 2018-02-05 04:50:44 UTC <chadbraunduin> Kickers who make most of their kicks.
960737489840492545 2018-02-05 04:50:41 UTC <chadbraunduin> Commentators who don't say things like "Holy Toledo" or "Whoa Nelly" after fairly routine touchdowns (or any other play) and who are generally fairly knowledgeable.
960737484123623425 2018-02-05 04:50:40 UTC <chadbraunduin> Skill position players who make impossible catches constantly that make Lynn Swann's Super Bowl X catches look routine. All positions - WRs, TEs, and RBs.
960737473658851329 2018-02-05 04:50:38 UTC <chadbraunduin> Coaches who freely incorporate "college tactics" like the Option or now the RPO and who now use all four downs.
960737468805984256 2018-02-05 04:50:36 UTC <chadbraunduin> Officials who are given an impossible task of parsing out sometimes byzantine rules but who are far more competent and held to a far higher standard than in the past.
960737464112558080 2018-02-05 04:50:35 UTC <chadbraunduin> Also, HD
960737460333539329 2018-02-05 04:50:34 UTC <chadbraunduin> End zone cameras that catch angles not seen in 1995. Pylon cameras that no one thought they needed but that add perspective.
960737455384223744 2018-02-05 04:50:33 UTC <chadbraunduin> On field graphics like first down markers that are so accurate and unobtrusive the announcers have stopped labeling them as "unofficial".
960737448811737089 2018-02-05 04:50:32 UTC <chadbraunduin> Let's say you watched football in the past but stopped after the 1995 season. Super Bowl 30 was your final game until you resumed yesterday. Here's what you will be pleasantly surprised to find after 22 years.
960737442394529793 2018-02-05 04:50:30 UTC <chadbraunduin> Professional football is just far better from an entertainment standpoint than it was in the past.
960737439986933760 2018-02-05 04:50:29 UTC <chadbraunduin> A. Let's set aside real concerns about football like the extreme violence which causes CTE along with many other major injuries. B. We are also setting aside the "controversy" of black athletes expressing political views
960737437994668032 2018-02-05 04:50:29 UTC <chadbraunduin> For all the hand wringing over the NFL these days, not without reason, the entertainment aspect of professional football was on full display yesterday in Super Bowl LII.
960372916868337669 2018-02-04 04:42:00 UTC <chadbraunduin> The biggest reason the yardage total was so high in the Super Bowl was that both teams combined for (I think) only two offensive penalties. Makes a difference when there isn't a drive killing false start every possession.
960352638859702272 2018-02-04 03:21:26 UTC <chadbraunduin> Extremely impressed by Doug Pederson's coaching job here. All the right moves.
960352052844072962 2018-02-04 03:19:06 UTC <chadbraunduin> Most yards in any NFL game!? WTF?
960347687521579008 2018-02-04 03:01:45 UTC <chadbraunduin> Really could have called interference on the conversion.
960347368452448256 2018-02-04 03:00:29 UTC <chadbraunduin> Gene Steratore again getting it right!
960346821943005185 2018-02-04 02:58:19 UTC <chadbraunduin> If that's not a move common to the game I've never seen one before.
960343989969981440 2018-02-04 02:47:04 UTC <chadbraunduin> And that's why they give you 4 downs.
960339880466403329 2018-02-04 02:30:44 UTC <chadbraunduin> Tom Brady's NBC graphic avatar looks a lot like a young Kevin McHale.
960335616897703937 2018-02-04 02:13:47 UTC <chadbraunduin> Another glass of prune juice for Giselle after that TD!
960333407938056195 2018-02-04 02:05:01 UTC <chadbraunduin> Gene Steratore!
960318634890551296 2018-02-04 01:06:19 UTC <chadbraunduin> And Nick Foles!
960316337930297344 2018-02-04 00:57:11 UTC <chadbraunduin> I don't think the kickers are properly highdrated. May I recommend the TB12 method?
960312245803724800 2018-02-04 00:40:55 UTC <chadbraunduin> That was the most expensive dead air in TV history.
960310606799822849 2018-02-04 00:34:25 UTC <chadbraunduin> Jimmy Garapollo would have made that catch.
960310006255181824 2018-02-04 00:32:01 UTC <chadbraunduin> Nice alligator arms, Tim Brady.
960297303755108354 2018-02-04 23:41:33 UTC <chadbraunduin> If the Virginia board of tourism doesn't use Chris Long's biceps for future marketing, that is a miss.

960155064240402432 2018-02-04 14:16:20 UTC <chadbraunduin> It's Super Bowl LII. So party like it's MCMXCIX.
959809827559133184 2018-02-03 15:24:29 UTC <chadbraunduin> It's telling that after Trump is gone, the two most salient phrases from his administration could be "American Carnage" and "American Disgrace".
957474623968436225 2018-01-27 04:45:14 UTC <chadbraunduin> Weeb Ewbank was an unrepentant Corgist, but Joe Namath gave the entire Corgi offense post game belly rubs - a true gentleman in victory.
957474617224060928 2018-01-27 04:45:12 UTC <chadbraunduin> Had a long chat today with my dog, Diego. He really opened up about his role in Super Bowl III (Corgis vs NY Jets). He was a reserve guard and special teams player.pic.twitter.com/OOt9F5k2c3
955259843463573504 2018-01-21 02:04:29 UTC <chadbraunduin> @SkippyForce As long as they play it in London. Bortles is unstoppable there.
955258067276443650 2018-01-21 01:57:25 UTC <chadbraunduin> I think the Vikings will beat the Jaguars in the consolation game.
955254840682311685 2018-01-21 01:44:36 UTC <chadbraunduin> Come-on Joe Buck. If the pass was incomplete on the field Doug Pederson would not be reviewing it.

955212150242447360 2018-01-21 22:54:58 UTC <chadbraunduin> This is the 1986 AFC Championship and Bortles is John Elway. Calling it now. #thedrive2
955210548957851649 2018-01-21 22:48:36 UTC <chadbraunduin> Bortles back to Bortleshttps://twitter.com/chadbraunduin/status/955201185383927808
955208029175255042 2018-01-21 22:38:35 UTC <chadbraunduin> Why does Jacksonville keep throwing deep fade routes? Low percentage.

955202411794259968 2018-01-21 22:16:16 UTC <chadbraunduin> Lambo more like Lambeau
955201185383927808 2018-01-21 22:11:24 UTC <chadbraunduin> Bortles is outplaying Brady right now and it's not even close.  Also, Belichick should have gone for it on fourth last drive.
955180839456989189 2018-01-21 20:50:33 UTC <chadbraunduin> Brady looks injured. Pats should put in Garapollo. Hahahahaha!
955178953060339718 2018-01-21 20:43:03 UTC <chadbraunduin> Like the Browns of 70 years ago, Jacksonville should change their name to Coughlins. Keep the gradient fill helmet. Lose the logo. #JacksonvilleCoughlins

950568088407302144 2018-01-08 03:21:07 UTC <chadbraunduin> Is this Nick Saban or Wade Phillips? You don't replace your starting QB at halftime. #NationalChampionship
950535951520059395 2018-01-08 01:13:25 UTC <chadbraunduin> Is there an ESPN channel dedicated to only showing Trump?
950200482391347200 2018-01-07 03:00:23 UTC <chadbraunduin> Also, maybe Scottish people shouldn't refer to any other accent as bonkers. Glass house, amirite?
950200156942675968 2018-01-07 02:59:05 UTC <chadbraunduin> Wild ride for Fargo, ND this weekend. First Bison win FCS Championship, but then later Ewan McGregor refers to their accent as "bonkers".
950166300378255360 2018-01-07 00:44:33 UTC <chadbraunduin> Payton is now in Belichick territory. Commend him for trying on fourth.
950159379260690432 2018-01-07 00:17:03 UTC <chadbraunduin> I am pretty sure if #93 hit me like that I would be dead. Sheesh.
950150854883135488 2018-01-07 23:43:11 UTC <chadbraunduin> Does Sean Payton get his glasses at ACE Hardware or Home Depot? Looks like he's about to do some weed eating.

950097455504330752 2018-01-07 20:11:00 UTC <chadbraunduin> Romo's commentary on players going into the stands almost makes it seem like he had considered it before.

950081172331270145 2018-01-07 19:06:17 UTC <chadbraunduin> It's funny that Tyrod only had 4 INTs all season when Peterman had 5 in his one half.
950079441086107649 2018-01-07 18:59:25 UTC <chadbraunduin> Buffalo is going to end up with relatively normal yardage totals except all of it in their own territory.
949853585281638400 2018-01-06 04:01:56 UTC <chadbraunduin> Could you imagine if Trump was an NFL owner - how poisonous that would be? My god the league would have collapsed by now.

942613608059547648 2017-12-17 04:32:51 UTC <chadbraunduin> Seems like Nationwide sort of yada yada'd the dramatic part of the story.
942613605631102977 2017-12-17 04:32:51 UTC <chadbraunduin> So I guess we are to assume that between 1 and 2, Peyton changes his mind on song vs jingle and Brad, a professional musician, tasks Peyton with writing lyrics instead of doing it himself like he had started in 1.
942613599410950144 2017-12-17 04:32:49 UTC <chadbraunduin> By the time Ad2 rolls around, Peyton is writing song lyrics.
942613596873338880 2017-12-17 04:32:49 UTC <chadbraunduin> In Ad1 Brad wants to write a song and Peyton wants a tingle.
942613593262116864 2017-12-17 04:32:48 UTC <chadbraunduin> Some parts of the Nationwide commercial series with Brad Paisley and Peyton Manning don't make sense.
942577617458421760 2017-12-17 02:09:50 UTC <chadbraunduin> @SkippyForce Yeah, by the definition of the rules, it wasn't a catch. I think most fans don't like these rulings because they defy common sense of what the receiver was doing with the ball.
942549493467230208 2017-12-17 00:18:05 UTC <chadbraunduin> Yet another what is a catch type of play.

937520676759629824 2017-12-03 03:15:22 UTC <chadbraunduin> The touchback out of end zone rule is probably the worst rule in football. Unnecessarily rewards the defense. Punishes the offense for reaching for the goal line.  Ball should be kept by the offense and placed at the 2 yard line.

792498395487145985 2016-10-29 22:48:36 UTC <chadbraunduin> @chadbraunduin Any year in which both Donald Trump and Brian Kelly are publicly humiliated is a good one by me. We'll see on Nov 8th. #2016
792497060595453952 2016-10-29 22:43:17 UTC <chadbraunduin> On the other hand, Notre Dame is currently 2-5. So 2016 hasn't been a total bust.
790723325106409472 2016-10-24 01:15:06 UTC <chadbraunduin> Whoa, whoa, whoa. 6 points in the first quarter. By a single team! This is a bit much for me. #MNF
790716167446929408 2016-10-24 00:46:39 UTC <chadbraunduin> The only way MNF beats SNF this week is if it ends in a 3-3 tie with an untimed free kick FG to send it OT.
790406716135317504 2016-10-23 04:17:00 UTC <chadbraunduin> 16th time an NFL game has ended 6-6. First since 1972. #SEAvsAZ

790400854067073024 2016-10-23 03:53:43 UTC <chadbraunduin> A 6-6 tie would be the best possible way this game could end. #SEAvsAZ

790281871506583552 2016-10-23 20:00:55 UTC <chadbraunduin> 219th NFL game to end with the score of 20-17. Next most common score is 17-14 with 177 occurrences. #WASvsDET
790279996136824832 2016-10-23 19:53:28 UTC <chadbraunduin> Matt Stafford is playing out of his mind. Hasn't gotten enough credit carrying an otherwise mediocre team. #Lions #elite

691837102166794241 2016-01-25 04:16:33 UTC <chadbraunduin> Hillary pulls out land grant colleges. Literally no GOP candidate, aside from the evil Cruz, could pull that.

691821449678577664 2016-01-25 03:14:21 UTC <chadbraunduin> If O'Malley now says judicial appointments he wins technocratic bingo.
691820601661616129 2016-01-25 03:10:59 UTC <chadbraunduin> O'Malley mentions immigration reform. That is the only real way for long term economic growth.
