746885160524644352 2016-06-25 01:57:53 UTC <kcordry76> @PeterCawdron yeah about ten years ago we had a bad one and lost power for ten days. Could hear trees breaking for days. Bad deal.
746882699915198464 2016-06-25 01:48:06 UTC <kcordry76> @PeterCawdron oh well gosh then you have missed all the F5 tornadoes and the rash of oil related earthquakes. Tough country, like yours.

746878552679714816 2016-06-25 01:31:37 UTC <kcordry76> @PeterCawdron but what could be in those subsets. Amazing to consider!!!
746877766616780800 2016-06-25 01:28:30 UTC <kcordry76> @PeterCawdron I'm more intrigued by idea of travel between dimensions. CERN is close to proving other dimensional particles. Fascinating!!
746864115142922240 2016-06-25 00:34:15 UTC <kcordry76> @PeterCawdron I'm curious if you have watched the documentary Sirius and if so what are your thoughts.

745796931398467585 2016-06-22 01:53:39 UTC <kcordry76> @cspan it's insane that the American public isn't able to watch this precedent setting sit-in. I hope this is enough to make a change!
