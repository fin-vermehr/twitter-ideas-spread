966501799795548160 2018-02-21 02:36:00 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @marcorubio @Phil_Lewis_ @YourCarGuyStan Credit absolutely. But he missed an opportunity to be an agent of change and actually be remembered for more than a water bottle and being degraded by POTUS.
966499963726368769 2018-02-21 02:28:42 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @Phil_Lewis_ @marcorubio could have changed the direction of this debate and his party if he had owned this moment and called out his own hypocrisy
966499596661940224 2018-02-21 02:27:15 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @CNN When @cnn showed the pictures of the students and teachers who were killed I saw the faces of the students in my from past classes and colleagues.   Then I saw my kids faces. We should all see our kids faces and do something.   #StudentsStandUp
966497922245447680 2018-02-21 02:20:35 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @marcorubio could have single handedly changed the course of this country in that moment after the father asked his question.   Instead he looked at a man whose daughter had been murdered and explained his words and went full politician mode. #StudentsStandUp
966497321767890944 2018-02-21 02:18:12 UTC <Coach_Nelson> That was an intense exchange and @marcorubio missed on a enormous chance to change this country. #cnn #StudentsStandUp
966495918920003585 2018-02-21 02:12:38 UTC <Coach_Nelson> This is a very real moment. I hope the words from @marcorubio are honest and true. Still very skeptical.   Reminds me of the old days when I used to tweet during political events.

919345251784855552 2017-10-14 23:32:43 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Point made. However we also live in a country where your license to carry a handgun is an acceptable form of ID for voting yet a college ID is not. Think about that.https://twitter.com/cloydrivers/status/919339558675902464

912092539305517059 2017-09-24 23:13:01 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @NFL I love this penalty so much. Even if they are friends and it was a joke. There is way too much unpenalized taunting in @nflhttps://twitter.com/claywendler/status/912041040948924417
912005849157111808 2017-09-24 17:28:33 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @OnePrideDet Yeah when it's green and yellow the refs thinks it's just good football

911973423152271361 2017-09-24 15:19:42 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @alex_reno Is it a protest or to prevent protests?
911973224702992385 2017-09-24 15:18:55 UTC <Coach_Nelson> I hope they communicate the intent. Hard to know if that is in protest or to prevent protests??https://twitter.com/jamieerdahl/status/911968948173905921
911972246863908865 2017-09-24 15:15:01 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @NFL He will damn sure take credit for the result either way.
911971962074869760 2017-09-24 15:13:54 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @NFL On that note I wouldn't be surprised if he is going to benefit from increased @nfl ratings.
911971423333339136 2017-09-24 15:11:45 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Current POTUS just wants power and money. The rest of us be damned. The country be damned.
911968296639123456 2017-09-24 14:59:20 UTC <Coach_Nelson> That was the truth for every POTUS in my lifetime Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama. Makes me sad to know the streak is broken.
911967369794383872 2017-09-24 14:55:39 UTC <Coach_Nelson> I always told students that if you disagree w/POTUS politically, it was important to know that person was trying to do their best for US.
911966325299441669 2017-09-24 14:51:30 UTC <Coach_Nelson> If kneeling athletes makes you so mad that you want to boycott then go for it. In your new free time maybe reexamine who is the snowflake
911963714903007232 2017-09-24 14:41:07 UTC <Coach_Nelson> And with the echo chamber thought bubble insulation of the internet they never advanced out of the selfish thought processes of adolescence
911963315714347009 2017-09-24 14:39:32 UTC <Coach_Nelson> These clueless adults are willing to restrict the rights of everyone else and substance to the ignorance of #whataboutism
911962972377018373 2017-09-24 14:38:10 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Schools and state govts have caved to the pressure from  parents for so long we have a generation of clueless adults.
911962426656030722 2017-09-24 14:36:00 UTC <Coach_Nelson> I believe this is a result of the low bar standards in the US educational system. Students cannot fail anymore, it's the teacher's fault.
911961180784201728 2017-09-24 14:31:03 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Admin and fox news want us to believe protests are against flag and military. Which makes no sense unless predisposed to believe that.
911960568038350848 2017-09-24 14:28:37 UTC <Coach_Nelson> The whole point of a protest is to do something that people will notice or be upset about in order to raise awareness or work to change.
911959818851766272 2017-09-24 14:25:38 UTC <Coach_Nelson> I mean flag burning is protected free speech yet this admin wants to force employees to stand?
911959017588740096 2017-09-24 14:22:27 UTC <Coach_Nelson> He's making the case that silent and peaceful protest should be prohibited in the name of blind patriotism.   Let that sink in.
911958483616124929 2017-09-24 14:20:20 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Here we have an intelligent govt official calmly making a case that employers should force employees to act against their beliefs.
911957597032534016 2017-09-24 14:16:49 UTC <Coach_Nelson> This is so much worse than what trump actually said. https://twitter.com/thisweekabc/status/911941620446068737

911802439203946496 2017-09-23 04:00:16 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @NFL @Lions Again this could be a historic moment. Be clear, be courageous and be strong.
911802026023096320 2017-09-23 03:58:38 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @NFL @Lions Fox news will feed misinformation and #WhatAboutism to those already frustrated so they don't see the truth.
911801410827800577 2017-09-23 03:56:11 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @NFL @Lions If you are someone who will be upset by the protests please take the time to learn the reason why. Don't just listen to fox news.
911801116886814720 2017-09-23 03:55:01 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @Lions We have to demand better from our political leaders and put them on notice. If @NFL players can lead that charge then more power to them.
911799972861038594 2017-09-23 03:50:28 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @Lions How about we all try to reach out, listen and love more? Compassion and empathy are not complicated they just take a little effort.
911798177552007168 2017-09-23 03:43:20 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @Lions I also expect a lot of protests in the stands tomorrow. If I was at a game I would ask to hold their hand while they protest.
911797655692615680 2017-09-23 03:41:16 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @Lions I want to be able to talk about this with my girls 10 years from now and know we watched it together.
911797198563799040 2017-09-23 03:39:27 UTC <Coach_Nelson> I intend to have my girls with me before the @Lions kickoff and I want them to see whatever happens.
911796763203457026 2017-09-23 03:37:43 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Leave no grey to be interpreted and prevent the hijacking of your message. This is something that may only happen once.
911795600219365376 2017-09-23 03:33:06 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Follow the lead of athletes like Doug Baldwin (statement below) and maybe take an even more pointed approach.pic.twitter.com/ROxKi7QNKa
911794486195425281 2017-09-23 03:28:40 UTC <Coach_Nelson> I would make it difficult for the fox news MOD squad to run their disingenuous narrative of "they are disrespecting the military"
911793310003589120 2017-09-23 03:24:00 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Sounds silly but I would issue a statement so media will have a difficult time assigning their own meaning to my actions.
911792873493991424 2017-09-23 03:22:15 UTC <Coach_Nelson> If several hundred players protest (as reported) the cause and message will be obvious to most of us. But I would encourage documentation.
911790203513294848 2017-09-23 03:11:39 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Tomorrow will be a very important day. Could be a turning point.pic.twitter.com/Huu4iGylQ8

911693880680165376 2017-09-23 20:48:54 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @StephenCurry30 @NFL 9/I hope all the "stick to sports" people made sure to tell POTUS to stick to screwing up our country.

911655937320071169 2017-09-23 18:18:07 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @StephenCurry30 @NFL 8/Theory 2, he is again trying to distract us from the theft of health care from 30M and/or the Russia investigation. #ItsWorking
911655529201766400 2017-09-23 18:16:30 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @StephenCurry30 @NFL 7/Theory 1, he wants to divide us whenever and however possible. A further divided electorate is is only chance if he makes it to 2020
911654468596518913 2017-09-23 18:12:17 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @StephenCurry30 @NFL 6/I really am searching for logic in these actions. There are only 2 conclusions I can reach. Both are sinister.
911654132058066944 2017-09-23 18:10:57 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @NFL 5/To feud w @StephenCurry30 makes him look so foolish. I applaud Curry for allowing the implosion to happen naturally.
911653727752327168 2017-09-23 18:09:21 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @StephenCurry30 @NFL 4/Calling for those who exercise their rights to be fired is so far beneath the office. He has indermined the authority to joke status.
911653207025373186 2017-09-23 18:07:16 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @StephenCurry30 @NFL 3/I doubt his comments will impact overall ratings. More that agree w him will not watch. More of those that disagree w him will watch.
911652822252445698 2017-09-23 18:05:45 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @StephenCurry30 2/Surely he planned to say these things but why? His comments will and should increase number of @NFL players protesting.
911652123292704768 2017-09-23 18:02:58 UTC <Coach_Nelson> 1/At a loss right now re trump's @NFL & @StephenCurry30 comments. Seems too easy to say "he just says whatever pops in his head"

909259373234360320 2017-09-16 03:35:02 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @espn Cheap dirty hits need to go. Your announcers need to be educated and stop playing the tough guy card. Challenge them to be better.
909259025061093376 2017-09-16 03:33:39 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @espn Demand more from your crews. What they say influences the attitudes of the viewers and future of football.
909258582926884864 2017-09-16 03:31:54 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @espn Just now in #SJSUvsUtah it happened again. Head to head contact and commentary goes to "we don't know what football is anymore".

908834673400467457 2017-09-15 23:27:26 UTC <Coach_Nelson> I refuse to put a D or an R in front of my name. I refuse to assign my ideology.
908740602556145664 2017-09-15 17:13:37 UTC <Coach_Nelson> We are not and cannot be 2 Americas. I don't know what to do to stop this seemingly inevitable degradation.
908739898345062400 2017-09-15 17:10:49 UTC <Coach_Nelson> I will only be watching @NewsHour or @LastWeekTonight for a good long time. They are the only sources I trust.
908739509927288832 2017-09-15 17:09:17 UTC <Coach_Nelson> I'm done with cable news. Totally done with it. Unless Will McAvoy (or Jeff Daniels) gets his own show.
908739105764237312 2017-09-15 17:07:41 UTC <Coach_Nelson> It is the 24 news channels and social media. Our division is their financial gain.
908738837903323136 2017-09-15 17:06:37 UTC <Coach_Nelson> They have divided us and it feels like we have reached the point of no return.  I thought the they was the politicians but there is another.
908738342006566912 2017-09-15 17:04:38 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Libs and cons take turns crying about hitler references depending on who is in office.
908737898014425088 2017-09-15 17:02:53 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Libs want to cry snowflake at angry trump supporters and cons do the same anytime there is a protest on a college campus
908737242356518912 2017-09-15 17:00:16 UTC <Coach_Nelson> And vice verse of course.
908737072575295488 2017-09-15 16:59:36 UTC <Coach_Nelson> However when liberals express an opinion as fact it is fake news.   See Jemel Hill, Russia, etc
908736677362810881 2017-09-15 16:58:02 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Fox News trained conservatives that their feelings = fact.  See climate change, Obamacare, Hillary, etc
908735726719688706 2017-09-15 16:54:15 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Seems to me we have a lot of hypocrisy right now "on all sides."   Thread?

808035684262887424 2016-12-11 19:48:14 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @DIRECTV @RedZoneChannel I would like a refund for this week. This is unacceptable.
808035258755125248 2016-12-11 19:46:32 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @DIRECTV @RedZoneChannel i keep getting this message after watching most of the 1st half. Whats going on? #FixItpic.twitter.com/iCg3WvcTd0
808034606050111488 2016-12-11 19:43:57 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @DIRECTV @RedZoneChannel ridiculous that your system is again failing subscribers. Can't watch my @Lions start 2nd half

808009722318254080 2016-12-11 18:05:04 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @RedZoneChannel seriously we have to pay a lot for your games now I can't watch anywhere?
808009540033712129 2016-12-11 18:04:21 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @DIRECTV @RedZoneChannel is your system down? Can't watch anything. Not cool.

805442264638099460 2016-12-04 16:02:54 UTC <Coach_Nelson> It would great to see @CFBPlayoff have the courage to put @PennStateFball in the playoff. Conference Champions should get priority.
805151945963016192 2016-12-03 20:49:17 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @KevinOnCFB yup. Now i just need to find tickets. Any idea how many each school gets?

696175854506926080 2016-02-06 03:37:12 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @mattkronner said he's pro life w exceptions for incest/life & heath of mother.
696174416636600321 2016-02-06 03:31:29 UTC <Coach_Nelson> This debate just took a turn to batshit city.  #GOPDebate #Rubio #Christie #Cruz
696174050310283264 2016-02-06 03:30:02 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Rubio is about to get his wish. Haha. What a bad choice of words.  #GOPDebate
696173837340119041 2016-02-06 03:29:11 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Bush just had a great answer on abortion. #GOPDebate
696173542291845120 2016-02-06 03:28:01 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Wow. Rubio had a solid answer them crapped all over himself attacking the media, dems & hillary.  #GOPDebate
696172359481360384 2016-02-06 03:23:19 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Rubio just said he worked on VA issues in a bipartisan way? Doesn't he know that isn't a good thing to GOP voters? #GOPDebate
696164895331487744 2016-02-06 02:53:39 UTC <Coach_Nelson> What just happened? Christie is all soft for substance abusers? #GOPDebate #ConfusedAsHell

695981600387895296 2016-02-06 14:45:18 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @Twitter Did the Koch brothers just buy @twitter bc Trumpertantrum killed faux news? #RIPTwitter
695981280211525633 2016-02-06 14:44:02 UTC <Coach_Nelson> @Twitter The @twitter algorithm switch (if real) has to be a revenue move right? Why else do companies do anything? #RIPTwitter #profitsoverpeople
695980733270102016 2016-02-06 14:41:52 UTC <Coach_Nelson> People raged about the Facebook algorithm for a week then no one cared. Twitter knows the same thing will happen again. #RIPTwitter
695980198991237121 2016-02-06 14:39:44 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Seems about right. As if the advertiser tweets weren't bad enough. #RIPTwitter https://twitter.com/official_EvanN/status/695966951768723456
695979697172193280 2016-02-06 14:37:45 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Well darn. I really believed twitter would let me decide what/who I wanted to read. Hope something else fills the void.  #RIPTwitter

695429725213237248 2016-02-04 02:12:21 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Feels like Hillary just says stuff to make herself sound different.
695081466091421696 2016-02-03 03:08:30 UTC <Coach_Nelson> What just happened? Hillary wants universal health care now too? #DemTownHall
695068904243216384 2016-02-03 02:18:35 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Bernie is having a night! Great answers and very honest.
695067351633543170 2016-02-03 02:12:25 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Bernie just gave a great answer in the town hall.
694354825207656448 2016-02-01 03:01:05 UTC <Coach_Nelson> I was worried Colbert would stop doing this stuff on the Late Show.  #ColbertDestroysTrumphttps://youtu.be/iPQuFqnXY98
693971798925283329 2016-01-31 01:39:04 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Congrats John Scott! This is the only All-Star game I will ever tell my girls about.  #JohnScott #NHLAllStar #MVPpic.twitter.com/qan1UEOcH8

693946207236788228 2016-01-31 23:57:23 UTC <Coach_Nelson> John Scott is on the same level as Kyler Elsworth. I love a great sports underdog hero story.  #JohnScott #NHLAllStar #MSU
693943439134711808 2016-01-31 23:46:23 UTC <Coach_Nelson> The #JohnScott situation went from bad to  great to sad to amazing. I almost feel like it's a conspiracy.  #NHLAllStar
693942542245744640 2016-01-31 23:42:49 UTC <Coach_Nelson> It is very clear that the NHL is the first pro league to get their #AllStar game right.  #NHLAllStar
693941565576773636 2016-01-31 23:38:56 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Awesome. Now go win this thing.  #JohnScott #NHLAllStarhttps://twitter.com/NHLonNBCSports/status/693940131334459392

692912031087861760 2016-01-28 03:27:56 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Did Russell Wilson Use Google for '#WCW' Posts About Girlfriend? http://teamstre.am/1nqNCca #hahaha @TheHjr14
692906713733664768 2016-01-28 03:06:48 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Cruz seemed way too prepared for those video clips.  #GOPDebate #InsideJob
692902480548593664 2016-01-28 02:49:59 UTC <Coach_Nelson> And that would be why none of this matters anyway.  #GOPDebatehttps://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/692902090688036865

692899082273210368 2016-01-28 02:36:29 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Damn I have a great tweet that I shouldn't send right now.  #GOPDebate
692897547442978816 2016-01-28 02:30:23 UTC <Coach_Nelson> It took a whole for the candidates to start whining about the moderators picking fights.  #GOPDebate
692896998043709440 2016-01-28 02:28:12 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Cruz is looking very needy right now. Did he expect to be treated like Trump or something?  #GOPDebate
692895030134976512 2016-01-28 02:20:23 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Trump says "We have more cameras than they do." #GOPDebatepic.twitter.com/wyxayQQ5x0
692894291895582720 2016-01-28 02:17:27 UTC <Coach_Nelson> Wierd that GOP governors create jobs but POTUS has nothing to do with it? #GOPDebate #TeamEffort

691361621864771584 2016-01-24 20:47:10 UTC <Coach_Nelson> So that was clearly targeting and dirty. @NFL needs to get with the program and eject players for that crap.  #DENvsNE #FixIt
690553843571097600 2016-01-22 15:17:20 UTC <Coach_Nelson> This morning I got to hold WMU history.  #MHSFCA #RTB #roWINgpic.twitter.com/g9BIHwJd70
