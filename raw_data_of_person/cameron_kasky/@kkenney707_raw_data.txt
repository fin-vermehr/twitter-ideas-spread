So its just fun, right? Is your pleasure of killing a boar more important than a human life?
967750705929949184 2018-02-25 13:18:42 UTC <kkenney707> @marcorubio When I look at those two guns, I dont see a difference. If they can assault people like an AR-15, its all the same to me. Since you seem to be so educated about the differences in these guns, take your knowledge and ban them all.
967745356774674434 2018-02-25 12:57:27 UTC <kkenney707> @washingtonpost Trump says he wants to arm teachers for protection, but it really just means more money for GOP from NRA. Banning assault rifles would take money out of their pockets. So ironically, removing guns will protect people but not make any one money. Trump and the GOP hate that.

Half of these kids will be voting in 2020, and many will be voting in 2018! They will be joining our fight!

937037878776999938 2017-12-02 19:16:54 UTC <kkenney707> @senorrinhatch @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @ShannonKetcher2 @mike_brown81 Today you're allowed 2 claim a $4,050 personal exemption for yourself, ur spouse & each of your dependents.Both the Senate and House bills eliminate.For families w/3 or more kids,that could mute if not negate any tax relief as a result of other provisions in the bill.
937037164755505153 2017-12-02 19:14:04 UTC <kkenney707> @senorrinhatch @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @ShannonKetcher2 @mike_brown81 When a credit is refundable, it means you still can get money from the government because of the credit, even when your federal income tax bill is zero.
937037052629143552 2017-12-02 19:13:37 UTC <kkenney707> @senorrinhatch @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @ShannonKetcher2 @mike_brown81 But the $1,000 increase won't be available to the lowest income families if they don't end up owing federal income taxes. That's because unlike the first $1,000, the additional $1,000 wouldn't be refundable.
937036906939994112 2017-12-02 19:13:02 UTC <kkenney707> @senorrinhatch @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @ShannonKetcher2 @mike_brown81 Senate GOP tax writers would make the credit available for any children under 18, up from today's under-17 age limit. But it reverts to under 17 again in 2025, a year before the increase is set to expire under the bill.

934065132509986816 2017-11-24 14:24:16 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @BKelnhofer @SirJonSimpson The total federal debt would balloon from todays $14.7 trillion to over $27 trillion, rising from 77% of GDP to almost 100%. Unless the U.S. changes course, in a decade, Washington will be spending 34% more than its taking in, and the gap only expands from there.

922584676493127682 2017-10-23 22:05:02 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @avanconia @Carolina_Pines1 @American1765 They are not disrespecting the flag, nor the anthem. They are protesting police brutality against minorities. Get your facts straight.
922118727906316291 2017-10-22 15:13:31 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump You knew what you signed up for. Deal with it.
922118601271889920 2017-10-22 15:13:01 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Im sure thats only 46% of your 32% base. Because most of us are not that stupid.

921846416376500225 2017-10-21 21:11:27 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @ColumbiaBugle And by the way, because of Trump, we are no longer the leader of the free World. That would be Angela Merkel.
921845817182507009 2017-10-21 21:09:04 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @ColumbiaBugle Ill choose the dairy line and Hillary before I listen to that dumbass piss off the other world leaders who since Trump now ALL hate us.
921844848533045248 2017-10-21 21:05:13 UTC <kkenney707> Hey @realDonaldTrump YOU KNEW WHAT YOU SIGNED UP FOR. So quit your bitching already.

920117804787027968 2017-10-16 02:42:34 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Why do you lie?Literally no one is confirming it will lower costs. On the bright side maybe your idiot supporters will see the light.
920116433841000448 2017-10-16 02:37:07 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump But what exactly have you done? Nothing. Obama worked his ass off for 8 yrs,hence the results you tweet. Your jealousy of him is so obvious

904721687106772997 2017-09-04 15:03:53 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Translation:start praying dreamers! I'm the assshole who loves 2 crush dreams. I said I loved the dreamers, but what I meant is Obama 's u
904720887395569665 2017-09-04 15:00:43 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Stop trade, stop immigrants, stop hard working dreamers, stop anything Obama put in place. All you do is stop things. What a winning agenda!
904376996611989504 2017-09-03 16:14:13 UTC <kkenney707> @susanemoney @DavidCornDC As usual, anything Obama says is with dignity and grace. Now we live in bizzaro world.
904372833404555264 2017-09-03 15:57:40 UTC <kkenney707> Thank you @realDonaldTrump for wasting my tax dollars, again.https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/904049217852903429
903998455630221312 2017-09-02 15:10:01 UTC <kkenney707> @JBA_NAFW @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump There's something called #realnews to let us know where the #fakeprez is. No need to give your itinerary every fucking day.
901842914497712128 2017-08-27 16:24:40 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump With USA having the worst president in all Nations in the world,we must build WALL around him, to protect all Americans.Who wants 2 chip in?
901839797035126784 2017-08-27 16:12:17 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Why are you talking about winning when people are dying in Texas? #Narcissist-hey Webster-just link 45's twitter account to this definition
901831836355219456 2017-08-27 15:40:39 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Stop lying!!! Mexico is not stupid!! I wonder if my neighbor wants to pay for that fence around my yard 
901831026837774336 2017-08-27 15:37:26 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @DaysLeft4Trump @succsessphil Literally ANYONE else would be a better choice, I can barely stand 4 more minutes of this loser!!

901821624344879104 2017-08-27 15:00:04 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @Underrated_Dom @triley713 She has to be joking right? Or is her head stuck up Fox News? Facts are facts, no president has EVER golfed more than 45.
901820609918889984 2017-08-27 14:56:03 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @Jamilwms @Jaron_W_Hall Surprised he's not trying to defund Red Cross, because they help the needy.  His "people" tell him what do & say, this does not fool me.
901454486987788288 2017-08-26 14:41:12 UTC <kkenney707> Feeling safe that u kept a racist out of jail for 60 days!Ur continued support of racism& abuse of power is disgusting @realDonaldTrump
901452231488262144 2017-08-26 14:32:14 UTC <kkenney707> Hey @realDonaldTrump, u are not Native American which means the Trumps are a family of immigrants.My bet would be they came over illegally.
900329236547895298 2017-08-23 12:09:51 UTC <kkenney707> Hey @realDonaldTrump, maybe it's the dementia, but you keep forgetting the "off script" comment "on all sides" which the #realnews facts.
898935844614131712 2017-08-19 15:53:01 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump So on one hand you support ending global terrorism and on the other you are encouraging, creating, and responsible for domestic terrorism.
898934621525626881 2017-08-19 15:48:09 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump I find it hilarious that u think we care about your FAKE MEETINGS. You are so worried about the wall but YOU have created war right here!!
898931811597918214 2017-08-19 15:36:59 UTC <kkenney707> Hey @KravisCenter say bye bye to a lot of rich palm beachers who will no longer donate or attend your venue until you drop #MaraLago 
896524778906857472 2017-08-12 00:12:18 UTC <kkenney707> Thank you for continuing to be our source of hope and inspiration in these difficult times. #bestpresidentever @BarackObama
895418926074654720 2017-08-09 22:58:02 UTC <kkenney707> Scary. @realDonaldTrump is this really the kind of popularity you were looking for?https://twitter.com/thehill/status/895417428179640320
889116013756895232 2017-07-23 13:32:31 UTC <kkenney707> @TrumpUSAforever Lost my house in housing crisis under Bush. My man Obama came along, got better job, have since purchased a new home and salary has doubled
889115103714529280 2017-07-23 13:28:54 UTC <kkenney707> @DLoesch @NRATV The guy that threatened u shouldn't have a gun. Crazy people should not have a gun. Angry people (like you) should not have a gun...
889114048427634689 2017-07-23 13:24:42 UTC <kkenney707> @DLoesch @NRATV So if the crazy guy who threatened your family had no gun, and you had no gun, and all the other crazies had no guns.... we'd all be safer
888796514792988672 2017-07-22 16:22:56 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @SharonBivens3 @lookforsun And they voted for trump, we got @BetsyDeVosED &now we will get dumber. It's exhausting keeping up with these people. But I'm still fighting
888795084799582209 2017-07-22 16:17:15 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @SharonBivens3 @lookforsun Exactly,how can we untrap them and free them from bad information?Some escape,but too many still think things like climate change isn't real
888793552460926976 2017-07-22 16:11:10 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @SharonBivens3 @lookforsun Calling bs on that,they chose to be unheard, they are allow themselves to be influenced by people who don't have their best interest in mind
888787621622796289 2017-07-22 15:47:36 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @SharonBivens3 @lookforsun I agree with this and surround myself with educated people. But the uneducated chose Trump.
888786517862342656 2017-07-22 15:43:13 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @SharonBivens3 @lookforsun I find so ironic how GOP only care about the unborn and not the actual children.
888785455054979075 2017-07-22 15:38:59 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Because she has been investigated already, are you new?You are like a small child who cries when the other kid got the trophy (popular vote)
888784351525208065 2017-07-22 15:34:36 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @SharonBivens3 @lookforsun Why do we see these people vote against their best interest? They need to get their noses out of the Bible and pay attention!
888783164419833856 2017-07-22 15:29:53 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @SharonBivens3 @lookforsun Spot on! So why are their true Christian values so skewed now? Because he's anti abortion and says God Bless America? I just don't get it.
888782418802561024 2017-07-22 15:26:56 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @SharonBivens3 @lookforsun We should all be worried. They are abusing religious freedom. Bringing it into politics is a huge mistake.
888781677673287680 2017-07-22 15:23:59 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @SharonBivens3 @lookforsun They support a crazy narcissist because of abortion, that's what drives them to support a lunatic. Jesus would've have not supported Trump
888781176818851841 2017-07-22 15:21:59 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb @SharonBivens3 @lookforsun Religious crazies landed Trump in office. I have no respect for these people that bring their religion into politics. They vote on one issue
888779342578372610 2017-07-22 15:14:42 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb Stop bringing your crazy religious bs to twitter. Trump only loves himself. Close the damn bible and read something else. He doesn't love u
888778590187380736 2017-07-22 15:11:43 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @peplamb So then we all agree, even crazy religious tweeters, that he is not doing his job. Making the entire world hates us does not make us safe.
888017226300895232 2017-07-20 12:46:19 UTC <kkenney707> @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @AddInfoOrg @KennyGGee Not when u insult the entire country by claiming Trump is Presidential, he's the furthest thing from it.
888015946002182144 2017-07-20 12:41:14 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @KennyGGee Use your Obamacare and get some mental help or at least a dictionary so you can look up the word Presidential, because it's not what u think
886570765004546050 2017-07-16 12:58:36 UTC <kkenney707> @mcspocky Yep, if you stay dumb you will do things like vote for @realDonaldTrump , that's what they are hoping for
885828211053080576 2017-07-14 11:47:58 UTC <kkenney707> @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Stop calling it a disaster, a lot of people are ALIVE right now because of it. Once you take away the mandate, costs no longer shared, FAIL!
884740750059220992 2017-07-11 11:46:47 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Go Dems! We voted for them to represent us, they are doing their job can you say that?
884520287311716352 2017-07-10 21:10:44 UTC <kkenney707> @williamlegate We "suffered" thru Obama for 8 years, now you know how we felt.

884145693329416192 2017-07-09 20:22:14 UTC <kkenney707> @abcnews @crazyladySCREAM @joanadeleq If you voted for him and won't stand up and admit you made HUGE mistake then you are part of the problem.
884145331717500929 2017-07-09 20:20:48 UTC <kkenney707> @abcnews @joanadeleq Joan, there is literally NOTHING positive to say about Trump. Stop embarrassing yourself.
884129752994512896 2017-07-09 19:18:54 UTC <kkenney707> @KellyannePolls I can barely look at you 2 women who support a sexist liar. I consider everything you tweet #alternativefacts Which actually means lies FYI
884128086828122114 2017-07-09 19:12:16 UTC <kkenney707> @Reince Never thought I'd miss this guy. He's a teddy bear compared to the alien beast that lives in our White House now. #sad
884127453630930949 2017-07-09 19:09:45 UTC <kkenney707> @POTUS @Reince So job growth and unemployment still holding steady from 44's hard work?It's gonna take time for us to see the US crumble under this clown.
884125529795956736 2017-07-09 19:02:07 UTC <kkenney707> @PolizeiHamburg @realDonaldTrump You created the anarchy. Another win? #MAGA - bring back Obama!

884124195143266306 2017-07-09 18:56:49 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Obama IS coming back?!?! Because that for sure would #MAGA
884120764311642113 2017-07-09 18:43:11 UTC <kkenney707> @thehill As is pretty much everything @realDonaldTrump does.
884119498567159812 2017-07-09 18:38:09 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl The only action he has take is tweeting, most unproductive president ever, hasn't even filled all positions and people are quitting already
884119046706343940 2017-07-09 18:36:21 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl When you say "world" are you referring to the little globe on your desk? Because the world has been united by our hatred for DT #NMP
884076869989134337 2017-07-09 15:48:45 UTC <kkenney707> @IvankaTrump #nobodycares what you are excited about
884076713961041920 2017-07-09 15:48:08 UTC <kkenney707> @IvankaTrump Hey #motheroftheyear - where are your children? lucky you can afford round the clock nannies, unlike MOSTLY EVERYONE
884075278716239872 2017-07-09 15:42:26 UTC <kkenney707> @POTUS @IvankaTrump You can keep saying the same pro-women shit over and over. As long as your sexist father is president, we don't believe a word u say.
884062522525044736 2017-07-09 14:51:45 UTC <kkenney707> @jules_su @jayshora @ADCBeast This gif pretty much sums it up, Putin's bitch: @realDonaldTrump
884062169826025474 2017-07-09 14:50:21 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump They also were looking forward to being with u so they could bring back stories of stupid things you said.The whole world is laughing at u.
884061203022086145 2017-07-09 14:46:30 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Why don't u just give Putin America's Password? You don't even believe Russia hacked the election, I mean Putin told you to deny it, puppet.
884060479144026112 2017-07-09 14:43:37 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Strongly pressed? You are a coward. How does it feel that Merkel is now referred to as leader of the free world? You embarrass us.
882279525589155840 2017-07-04 16:46:45 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump #ThanksObama
882279191319904256 2017-07-04 16:45:25 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Actually retail sales are soft, people are scared to spend because of you.  You can't take credit for Obama's economy. He still rocks BTW.
881204979230486531 2017-07-01 17:36:53 UTC <kkenney707> Thank you @funder , well said.https://twitter.com/funder/status/881170781362958337
881168560936144898 2017-07-01 15:12:10 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @Rosie At least we know it will make for a great movie/documentary one of these days. Looking on the bright side?
881162120913719297 2017-07-01 14:46:35 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Sorry for Kate, but one crazy illegal immigrant with a gun is no different than a crazy American with a gun. Common denominator: GUN
879707248833855489 2017-06-27 14:25:26 UTC <kkenney707> I don't understand how GOP think it's OK to force me to have car insurance and not health insurance. I'd rather have health insurance.
876457763538436101 2017-06-18 15:13:09 UTC <kkenney707> Happy Father's Day @BarackObama , enjoy the day with your beautiful family

876130510115921925 2017-06-17 17:32:45 UTC <kkenney707> @POTUS @nbc @MSNBC @CNNPolitics @AdedapoLinda @tahino1 It should be 100% disapproval, then I would have hope that America could be great again which by the way was just last year #thanksObama
876129199886671872 2017-06-17 17:27:33 UTC <kkenney707> @nytimes @myherbalmuse This seems to be their only agenda, rolling back everything good Obama did. At least the history books will show trump as worst Prez!
876128247897100288 2017-06-17 17:23:46 UTC <kkenney707> @GLSCHWALL @SenWarren Thank you Lizzy for always fighting for us!!!!!
876127991989972992 2017-06-17 17:22:45 UTC <kkenney707> @pbpost Do we live in some sort of bizzaro world where Republican leaders constantly do the opposite of what is good for the country??
876125858100109319 2017-06-17 17:14:16 UTC <kkenney707> @POTUS @FLGovScott All I can say is thank goodness for term limits

876094428989054978 2017-06-17 15:09:23 UTC <kkenney707> Sorry @GOPPollAnalyst ... our president just keeps lawyering up.Guess who hasn't lawyered up?That's right! Hillary Clinton and Barack Obamahttps://twitter.com/left_aardvark/status/876089468222144512
876092606421356544 2017-06-17 15:02:09 UTC <kkenney707> Child of two intelligent people, her tweets always have substance. Now we have the Trump kids, why did we let the dumbasses take over??https://twitter.com/chelseaclinton/status/875707384940957697
876091737139277825 2017-06-17 14:58:41 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Hey @marcorubio , Floridian and Cuban Americans hate you btw
876087727892180992 2017-06-17 14:42:45 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump Another lie, undoing every GOOD thing Obama did is not impressive. Anything actually good for the country on your to do list?
876086797503262720 2017-06-17 14:39:04 UTC <kkenney707> @catdemar @30daysof @JitteryKitten_ @GOPPollAnalyst Poor, poor delusional Katica, just can't get over that Hillary nor Obama are under investigation.  And they never will be.
874432782952476673 2017-06-12 01:06:36 UTC <kkenney707> @IvankaTrump So why not focus on healthcare, or when you are so fucking rich you don't care if you have millions in medical bills. Well the rest of us do
874432532183474177 2017-06-12 01:05:36 UTC <kkenney707> @IvankaTrump Hillary wanted to train people, bitch. To help people get out of coal jobs and other jobs being automated. Unemployment at all time low, BTW
874427651246706689 2017-06-12 00:46:12 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr In your bizzaro world,ok, yes that would be true. In the real world we want to see USA succeed and we don't see that happening under daddy
874380076254711813 2017-06-12 21:37:10 UTC <kkenney707> @realDonaldTrump @BrandonTXNeely @mcrae_lynn Solution:not-for-profit universal healthcare for all. Why should anyone profit from someone's illness. Get paid, of course, corp. profit-no

845613535149350912 2017-03-25 12:29:12 UTC <kkenney707> Hmmm, no morning tweets from @realDonaldTrump ... I'm guessing because Putin doesn't give a shit about #ACA or #trumpcare
