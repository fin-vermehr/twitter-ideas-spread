972268720763551744 2018-03-09 00:31:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaketapper I guess the more important point is that the guy is a self-loving philistine who wouldnt want to spend time with any of those folks. Picking Seb Gorka over Toni Morrison isnt an efficiency problem.
972264601629806592 2018-03-09 00:15:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaketapper But not many of those folks like Trump.
972194304713097216 2018-03-09 19:35:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @clusterstock @meliarobin this is 3 people
972138807419006976 2018-03-09 15:55:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> The bigger problem is that shes right - that Globalist is an antisemitic term for Jewish which the President and other Republicans use regularlyhttps://twitter.com/sethamandel/status/972136467953848320
971844785517486080 2018-03-08 20:27:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Nobody would pay attention to that story anyway - too complicated. Mueller will either convert it to results or he wont.
971836722152579072 2018-03-08 19:55:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jimgeraghty Also its possible that some socialists are racists and misogynists.
971831089147691008 2018-03-08 19:32:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RichardGrenell @SalenaZito @MeghanMcCain This doesnt seem like even the 100th biggest problem facing our country right now.
971829091958644736 2018-03-08 19:24:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom That guy brought a knife to a gun fight.
971826163709394944 2018-03-08 19:13:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine IANAL but I think that might be considered tortious interference (?)
971778273163165701 2018-03-08 16:02:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @UrbanAchievr @madbev14 @BlueBoxDave As a father, Im disgusted that you would hire a person like this.
971775973610811392 2018-03-08 15:53:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PressSec @davidaxelrod How could she have handled the topic more adroitly?
971560454198710272 2018-03-07 01:37:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz Did you miss the lying part
971532816772050944 2018-03-07 23:47:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MayorOfLA @BrianNorgard Also presumably a bunch of cool aerospace companies, some of which are software-heavy. Yeah when Im in Santa Monica I find its a mystery why there arent more tech startups locating there.
971530464673452033 2018-03-07 23:38:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MayorOfLA @BrianNorgard Yeah this is compelling. What are the biggest eng-centric tech companies in LA - Tinder, Snap, SpaceX, Tesla design, other?
971519349642031104 2018-03-07 22:53:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaynordlinger Yeah some of them still write strongly worded letters.

971231351935451136 2018-03-06 03:49:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarkHarrisNYC Ivanka?
971189989034754049 2018-03-06 01:05:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenjySarlin @baseballcrank What you see as cheap grace I see as moral principle. Yes I agree with the characterization of your views as a tradeoff. You are generally willing to tolerate Trumps racism, misogyny, and corruption to achieve other goals.
971186262047522816 2018-03-06 00:50:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenjySarlin @baseballcrank I can see how you can come to that conclusion if you dont think anything Trump does is really all that bad.
971185972825145345 2018-03-06 00:49:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ddknyt @adamgoldmanNYT @MarkMazzettiNYT @NatashaBertrand Can you explain more?
971185572503986176 2018-03-06 00:47:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenjySarlin @baseballcrank The argument is that Charlottesville was so contemptible that anyone with integrity should have resigned if Trump did not agree to change his pro-Nazi stance and instead renounce the Nazis. Some things are more important than do I have influence in my core area of expertise.
971174341038649344 2018-03-06 00:03:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benjaminwittes @yashar OK its a go

971159525737680897 2018-03-06 23:04:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lloydblankfein Strongly disagree. He should have never joined this despicable administration, or, at a minimum, quit after Charlottesville.
971149688312180736 2018-03-06 22:25:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> I guess if The Federalist can tolerate POTUS sexually assaulting women, rationalizing Trumps protectionism is a no-brainerhttps://twitter.com/blueboxdave/status/971148331421503490
971138134816669697 2018-03-06 21:39:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @owillis This is totally true. The whining yesterday about how dare networks interview Nunberg while hes [drunk or whatever] was comical. Also its fun to see the Parkland kids kick their asses and have conservatives moan about how unfair it is.
971135069409574912 2018-03-06 21:26:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AdamSinger @kfury OK fair. Im not sure you have a future in confectionery marketing.
971134861518848000 2018-03-06 21:26:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson @_Drew_McCoy_ This tweet is ridiculous. Rice and Gates pushed Tillerson because Tillerson / Exxon was a big client of theirs.

970694827988869120 2018-03-05 16:17:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jimgeraghty Whats your purpose in posting this?
970690714823610370 2018-03-05 16:01:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CharlesPPierce Because conservatives find it a useful issue to stir up racism among their voters, just like gay marriage helped them stir up homophobia among their voters.

970370236653346816 2018-03-04 18:47:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JohnJHarwood Given how much Trump has tried to turn the public against the press and threatened fascist-like attacks on the press - why does it make sense for reporters to attend these events and share in social fun with Trump?
970104298922102784 2018-03-03 01:11:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson You and @RadioFreeTom are really going Kardashian on us with the lifestyle updates.

969262208302571520 2018-03-01 17:24:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @farhip How about having the guts to call out Fox for being filled with propaganda bullshit lies, rather than create a moral equivalence narrative? Your headline is awful. CNN isnt perfect but Fox is fascist state media.

968994852221329408 2018-02-28 23:42:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT @wokerobin She is unquestionably the best US politics reporter writing today.
968993227113037825 2018-02-28 23:36:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT You are best reporter in US. But if your sources are WH-based, why should we take characterizations @ face value? They have huge incentive to assert these explanations & theres no way to prove motivation. Ive broken up w people/orgs & sometimes havent been publicly open re why
968988839908859904 2018-02-28 23:18:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @POTUS @opechanga @AriFleischer You are doing great work for POTUS in your current role.

968672295840489472 2018-02-27 02:20:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshgreenman Sure reasonable people can agree to disagree about this; Im just saying that Roku is closer to Apple TV than Chrome
968670319429890048 2018-02-27 02:12:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshgreenman True but they could easily block it as they might a porn channel. I bet they block many channels / pick and choose. Im disagreeing with the web browsing analogy.
968668942985080834 2018-02-27 02:07:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshgreenman I dont think thats right. Its a channel that they can decide to block.
968568500766752769 2018-02-27 19:28:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @williamlegate @davidhogg111 Actually I prefer you challenging people like Alex Jones and calling them out on their lies. Your standing up to Jones today (and his whiny supplication in response) was the most effective approach Ive ever seen re neutering Jones.
968524755912425472 2018-02-27 16:34:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidhogg111 @charlescwcooke @jackfowler The more forcefully conservative critics go after Dave the better. Have at it! He singlehandedly destroyed Alex Jones this morning.
968197032350371840 2018-02-26 18:52:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KFILE Facts dont care about your feelings
968189941690777600 2018-02-26 18:24:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> It would be great to get a panel of conservative writers and see how it compares - defaming the Parkland kids vs. smearing black NFL players.https://twitter.com/awfuljournalism/status/968189402198544385
968156076649533441 2018-02-26 16:09:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lachlan @JWGOP Lachlan youve really nailed Dave Hogg on some inconsistencies and ambiguities in his writing - great work.
967922406214967297 2018-02-25 00:40:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sandwich @adamlisagor @alexia @rrhoover He made the original Dropbox homepage video, right?
967922030128451586 2018-02-25 00:39:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Classic conservative BS on assault weapons. Even Fox News regular Ralph Peters agrees there *is* such a thing as assault weapons. Stop trying to make gun control proponents look stupid with word definition arguments. https://nypost.com/2018/02/22/automatic-weapons-dont-belong-in-the-hands-of-everyone/amp/https://twitter.com/bethanyshondark/status/967059201498472448
967919972633620480 2018-02-25 00:31:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FrankLuntz Cmon, Fox News is telling athletes to be quiet because they are black.
967919448978997248 2018-02-25 00:29:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FrankLuntz Thats because those other groups are predominantly white.
967553898985607168 2018-02-24 00:16:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AndrewCMcCarthy @hughhewitt Thanks Hugh. Youre among the politest conservative Twitter writers Ive interacted w. Appreciate your tone & engagement. For the record IMO Andrew McCarthy will be proven spectacularly wrong over time, but I agree he is a specialist re rationalizing the Trump POV on Mueller etc.
967551188517339136 2018-02-24 00:05:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ddale8 @Twitter @hughhewitt I mean, this is the consensus across the board among experts. But hey you do you Hugh.
967551034083000320 2018-02-24 00:05:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Twitter @hughhewitt Per @ddale8: The Schiff memo says the FBI had independent reason, separate from the Steele dossier, to believe Carter Page was knowingly helping Russian intelligence, and that, in FISA renewal applications, it gave the court information that corroborated the dossiers claims
967549733743992833 2018-02-24 00:00:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Twitter @hughhewitt You arent a real journalist. What a disgraceful, tribal, dishonest tweet.
967548802222628864 2018-02-24 23:56:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom That sounds noble / romantic. But who will lead the resistance that will end your exile? Romney? Kasich? Whos your de Gaulle?  The problem is your party *hasnt* been hostilely taken over. Rather, half your voters (the more passionate half) embrace Trumpism; its who they are.
967545248359464960 2018-02-24 23:42:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom I dont see it. Theres barely 1 elected official in your party to admire, with courage. # of high-integrity voices like you is ~30, tops? The Bill Kristol/Steve Schmidt path seems like the only practical one for making a difference. But Im not in your shoes, so what do I know.
967493887416659968 2018-02-24 20:18:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi Your president gives more access to Alex Jones than most MSM outlets. Also note that I mentioned Hannity in my tweet. And while Im at it, worth noting that many other Fox people lie nonstop. Do you insist that Jeanine Pirro etc reverse themselves when their lies are disproved?
967489370721632256 2018-02-24 20:00:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi This is a great principle. Did you ask Hannity and Alex Jones to do this after Pizzagate, Seth Rich, etc.?
967253698723307520 2018-02-23 04:23:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbouie Her followers dont like Michelle Obama or African-Americans.
967225375628525568 2018-02-23 02:31:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman Well agree to disagree. Appreciate your response. IMO, aside from a handful of officials, shameful silence has been the norm.
967224377585496064 2018-02-23 02:27:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hey @RealSaavedra did you come to a view as to whether CNN engaged i. a coverup? If so, could you reply to your own tweet with follow-up? Huge thanks. https://twitter.com/realsaavedra/status/967170687357145088
967221511961460736 2018-02-23 02:15:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman I dont think you are a bigot but your partys elected office holders generally stay silent in the face of Trumps racism/anti-immigrant rhetoric. For example, did any Cong/Sens condemn Trumps snake poem today? Racist or just cowardly? How can you tell.
967219240074854401 2018-02-23 02:06:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ErikWemple @KFILE @benshapiro @RealSaavedra Also wheres that correction?
967218999569207296 2018-02-23 02:05:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ErikWemple @KFILE @benshapiro @RealSaavedra Still showing up for me as your pinned tweet. Great journalism today btw.
967216368700375041 2018-02-23 01:55:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ErikWemple @RealSaavedra @KFILE @benshapiro Still up
967208787353354240 2018-02-23 01:25:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ErikWemple @RealSaavedra @KFILE @benshapiro Still up.
967199669553061888 2018-02-23 00:49:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ErikWemple @RealSaavedra @KFILE @benshapiro How long did this tweet stay up after it was clear it was false? Its still up btw.
967158757040971776 2018-02-23 22:06:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alex I dont understand what the word arrogant means in this context. You dont think they will be successful in executing this combination?
967113090213888000 2018-02-23 19:05:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson Seriously?
967062012273475585 2018-02-23 15:42:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Tom fyi I get less value from your tweets which QT Sean Davis because he blocks me
966883898100600832 2018-02-22 03:54:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Super-thoughtful. (Cant remember if I read it b4.) But no mention of racism, misogyny, anti-LGBT, anti-immigrants. IMO those cleavages are more divisive than guns, religion, media watching. And IMO it is R leaders (some, not all) who exploit this hate, w POTUS as hater-in-chief.
966880371202703377 2018-02-22 03:40:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Yes, Im a fan, which is why I follow you. But notwithstanding that, I am cynical about conservative worries about the risk of a guns-driven civil war. I dont recall this kind of civil war rhetoric about Trumps racism and misogyny.
966876091150344192 2018-02-22 03:23:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench David does The National Review accept funding from any gun-related groups / the NRA?
966849680712888320 2018-02-22 01:38:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench You werent worried like this by Trumps racism and misogyny?
966840828760150016 2018-02-22 01:03:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Their respect for human life might give them pause.
966836105021739008 2018-02-22 00:44:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @harrymccracken The political preferences of old vs young generations is so polar opposite - its not productive to ignore this lens.
966356525177503750 2018-02-21 16:58:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @cwarzel CNN isnt Doug Jones or Jason Kander, trying to persuade these people to come back to the light.
966356050071965696 2018-02-21 16:56:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @cwarzel Shows how deep seated the willful ignorance is. We cant avoid revealing this just because it hurts feelings / embarrasses people. Truth is truth.
966167670897958917 2018-02-20 04:28:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @slack2thefuture IMO a bigger problem is: many ppl simply dont confront pro-Trump friends & family, at all. Kids & grandkids gotta confront older/60+ generations who take BS they hear from Fox News, etc. as gospel. Empathy & tone - sure its impt, but socially expedient silence is bigger issue.
966158579538518016 2018-02-20 03:52:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @slack2thefuture Drew Griffin is not a friend or relative of that woman.

966002819156279297 2018-02-20 17:33:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> Lots of heated argument today about whos worse  Buchanan or Trump. Thanks Republicans!https://twitter.com/frankluntz/status/966002013912948736

965635543638867970 2018-02-19 17:13:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stephenfhayes Why gullible necessarily? Maybe hes effectively a Russian agent.
965337605968683008 2018-02-18 21:29:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @flttrbydragnfly Sure - did you read the post I linked to? Its a very thorough and thoughtful analysis of whether Pence wants to hang gay people. What do you use for research?
965323761611427840 2018-02-18 20:34:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro https://www.snopes.com/2017/10/19/mike-pence-hang-gay-people/
965323731630542848 2018-02-18 20:34:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro You mean bc Dems dont hate gay ppl? I agree, but I also think hes be well-known anyway as one of the most successful openly gay Olympic athletes ever - worth celebrating.  Tbc, Snopes cant figure out if Trump is right that Pence wants to hang gay people.
965096889644351488 2018-02-17 05:33:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EsotericCD gauche, tasteless, loud, improper
965094810452418560 2018-02-17 05:25:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion But hey when he does something good conservatives should say so.
965076535777652736 2018-02-17 04:12:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion I liked the Emma Gonzalez video better.
964683900856487937 2018-02-16 02:12:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @McFaul Which Americans?
964619257874010112 2018-02-16 21:55:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CharlesPPierce Its unimaginable that the Russians wouldnt seek credit / something in return from candidate Trump. Go to this trouble and not make it clear that you were helping him? Nobody bad acts this way. Selfless election fixing - lol.
964617548560936960 2018-02-16 21:48:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RichLowry @JonahNRO This theory didnt occur to Rich.
964588901145788416 2018-02-16 19:54:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lookner Original goal: defeat Hillary. Revised goal: elect Trump. Not so hard, right?
964588194141323264 2018-02-16 19:52:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT Zero chance - he will get yelled at by people there who are angry with him.
964573940361314304 2018-02-16 18:55:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lookner in this indictment. Stay tuned!
964569720677572608 2018-02-16 18:38:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lookner The indictment says the Russians were trying to help Trump.
964569505870442496 2018-02-16 18:37:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lookner You cant be serious.
964553835489370112 2018-02-16 17:35:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Start with our null hypothesis that Congressional Republicans are cowardly selfish toadies. Flake, McCain and Romney (pro forma for his election) are exceptions.
964553141038411776 2018-02-16 17:32:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom This is oversimplifying. Plenty of us think that Romney has high integrity and loves his country, which makes him very different from most Republicans in Congress.
964291457732419585 2018-02-15 00:12:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @matthewamiller Why is it so clear that Gates will put pressure on Manafort? Trying to understand.
964224013970038784 2018-02-15 19:44:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Flirting? The president isnt flirting. Bannon and Miller are White House senior staff. Tucker Carlson and InfoWars are WH state media. Fine people. This isnt flirting.
964221580946501632 2018-02-15 19:35:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kfury Thats why I waited a while to criticize you
964213594224132096 2018-02-15 19:03:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @ReaganBattalion @suarez1116 Also Fast and Furious and Benghazi.
964199436497727488 2018-02-15 18:07:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @ReaganBattalion @suarez1116 Yeah do you remember when Obama lied about keeping your doctor? It wasnt true - you couldnt keep your doctor with Obamacare! That was a huge lie. Obama lied a lot like that - all the time. Also the IRS scandal.
964198904915886080 2018-02-15 18:05:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion You arent a news outlet. Conveying a quote like that with no color implies accepting it as sincere.
964198687198011393 2018-02-15 18:04:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion I would never interfere with law enforcement and Id love to meet with Bob Mueller, Donald Trump
964197299034324992 2018-02-15 17:58:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @ReaganBattalion I care about your health, Ronald McDonald.
964197072726499328 2018-02-15 17:57:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @ReaganBattalion But why are you tweeting it? You believe this quote reflects sincere, thoughtful sentiment?
964188727655321600 2018-02-15 17:24:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @ReaganBattalion You cant be serious with this tweet.
963868609352155136 2018-02-14 20:12:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @poniewozik This is an extraordinarily pessimistic take. Stranger Things, The Crown, & Bojack HM = among freshest, most fun shows of past 5yrs. By contrast, HBO makes v little new thats super fun. Netflix lets creators do their thing w/o interference - big dif vs trad networks you admire
963627604191268864 2018-02-13 04:14:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianefallon lol
963621023756140545 2018-02-13 03:48:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaynordlinger Wow this is a super normalizing tweet. How about - this is disgusting and corrupt behavior and we should get to the bottom of what happened. Maybe I gotta look to the Weekly Standard for a normal principled reaction.
963453402473578496 2018-02-13 16:42:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoePerticone What if the dog was passionate about disenfranchising African-Americans?
963162690796404736 2018-02-12 21:27:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro Nah I dont think its just a portrait thing with you and these tweets.
962425301899780097 2018-02-10 20:37:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RedState This is great.
962113501887021057 2018-02-09 23:58:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidaxelrod Unlikely.
962013953902592001 2018-02-09 17:22:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT Your point about honesty is important, but I hope you dont ignore another important theme - that Trump and his White House condone misogyny and abuse of women. You have such an influential. voice - please address this aggressively.
962009923381968896 2018-02-09 17:06:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench This post makes me think that Trump is a bad guy.
961753540959002627 2018-02-08 00:08:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kampeas @SethAMandel Also Robert Byrd was in the KKK.
961753100577984512 2018-02-08 00:06:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kampeas @SethAMandel Also Jesse Jacksons hymietown comment.
961349640376410112 2018-02-07 21:23:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoceraBV Do you also have a view on what Bill Belichick should do in the off-season?
961317701057572864 2018-02-07 19:16:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans uh so where are you on Trumps parade
961312232368832512 2018-02-07 18:54:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @casey__allen Yeah I havent heard any of their names lately.
961106790808215553 2018-02-06 05:18:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> More like: John Kerry warning Putin not to invade Ukraine, if it were in Obamas selfish personal political interest for Putin to invade Ukraine.https://twitter.com/reaganbattalion/status/961106196253040640
961039409050140672 2018-02-06 00:50:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stephenfhayes Is there any conservative outlet that has maintained its integrity besides Weekly Standard?
959474358497435648 2018-02-02 17:11:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NicolleDWallace Because all the care about is protecting Trump.
959272117173870592 2018-02-01 03:47:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson Dammit Rick if someone pees on your bed - you tell me where you are going to sleep.
959266026566242305 2018-02-01 03:23:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz This is an incredible tweet.
959263821847085056 2018-02-01 03:14:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @LOLGOP Also I dont think the idea was that Trump planned to sleep on the soiled bed.
959249227619581952 2018-02-01 02:16:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO All 5 of his followers agree its so.
959234334258425856 2018-02-01 01:17:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac Yeah. I mean, East Coast PE has been investing in travel shit for 20 years and hasnt created a business like airbnb. Maybe these folks should just defer and take direction from people who build great products.
959208280181518336 2018-02-01 23:34:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac Ill take Chesky and his world changing products over Tosi and his revenue, any time.
959139092209451008 2018-02-01 18:59:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TriciaHerrick1 Yeah of course. A real editorial board with integrity would of course be defending Chris Wray, Rod Rosenstein and Mueller against Pompeo, Ryan, Trump. The WSJ editorial board is just Murdoch these days.
959133411087597569 2018-02-01 18:36:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> Perhaps they have strong principles, something the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board had when it was independently owned.https://twitter.com/kimstrassel/status/959129766073843717
959114706647531520 2018-02-01 17:22:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ezraklein This doesnt really explain why so many Rs are stepping down now and avoids altogether considering alternative theories. Weird article.
958856817819320320 2018-01-31 00:17:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AriFleischer I think the difference is that Trump is the most corrupt and dishonest President ever  a pathological selfish liar  and Obama was not. See if that explanation helps.
958855474522112000 2018-01-31 00:12:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TGowdySC @kyledcheney Isnt an obvious guess that Gowdys timing is related to the Nunes memo process and Gowdys frustrations with it?
958823552030883840 2018-01-31 22:05:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NumbersMuncher Did this CNN article really use the word seize twice
958811941970980864 2018-01-31 21:19:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Im seeing a lot of this today (reasonable conservatives bemoaning idiots) but theres no self-awareness that Trump and Fox News inflame this idiocy. Its just fake to cry about people being dumb but not point the finger at those two evil actors.https://twitter.com/esotericcd/status/958811004149862400
958802648915853312 2018-01-31 20:42:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> Homophobe Mike Pence will be a better president than Donald Trump is a campaign slogan that could unite this country.
958801041138397184 2018-01-31 20:35:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion @mattgaetz Antisemites love it when you play it both ways. Wink wink they get it 
958797735049576448 2018-01-31 20:22:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HotlineJosh Hawley isnt fringe. He seems like a misogynist. Isnt that the bigger story or do you care more about the horse race stuff?
958760289809317888 2018-01-31 17:54:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stephenfhayes Isnt an obvious explanation why Gowdy and others are leaving is that they are ashamed of being associated with the Trump Administration and with Trump himself? How can anyone with high integrity feel about such a corrupt, dishonest and self-serving president?
958574577373843456 2018-01-30 05:36:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @a_cormier_ @TomNamako Source?
958552696650219520 2018-01-30 04:09:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FrankLuntz Weird that you post a tweet like this as someone who purports to present objective analysis.
958548723075661824 2018-01-30 03:53:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CillizzaCNN Wheres your timer re Republicans giving their Steve Wynn money back?
958538051025645568 2018-01-30 03:10:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baseballcrank Also Obama once said that if you wanted to keep your doctor you could. But that wasnt true.
958493914092072961 2018-01-30 00:15:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi I can explain. Its because Trump is such a huge liar and is totally untrustworthy and super-corrupt. John Dillinger was a criminal who misused guns a lot so it wouldnt make sense for him to give a speech on gun control.
958480684154200064 2018-01-30 23:22:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> We dont think the US is Nazi Germany, but we do believe Trump is greedy for as much dictatorial power as he can seize, w/zero regard for democratic institutions, or the rule of law. And he gains power by harnessing racism, misogyny, antisemitism, hatred. It does sound familiar!https://twitter.com/reaganbattalion/status/958476266050551809
958376816300797952 2018-01-30 16:30:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhine #PruittWasRight
958369339903680512 2018-01-30 16:00:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ezraklein Ezra its not nuts. Its fascist gaslighting. We gotta stop using words like strange weird, nuts, crazy. These Trump guys are monsters who lie nonstop and inflame the hatred and ignorance of their followers to subvert American democratic institutions to preserve their own power.
958209102479437824 2018-01-29 05:23:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HoarseWisperer thanks!
958209058682503168 2018-01-29 05:23:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @infowars @MSNBC @mattgaetz Infowars are Sandy Hook truthers - why would you appear on that show?
958208826045480961 2018-01-29 05:22:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HoarseWisperer Does Wray appoint or Trump?
958207296839999488 2018-01-29 05:16:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HoarseWisperer How long will Bowditch serve in an acting role?
958205909989081090 2018-01-29 05:11:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ben Shapiro is definitely in the Trump tank.https://twitter.com/radiofreetom/status/958195243886690304
958205780951384064 2018-01-29 05:10:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @RadioFreeTom You are the man for standing up to Shapiros garbage. Thanks.
958190660087005184 2018-01-29 04:10:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Also Danny Tarkanian
958187832459145216 2018-01-29 03:59:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom This guy has become a straight Trump partisan who sprinkles smart-sounding pixie dust over refried Fox News bullshit; his followers think hes a genius, and theyre thrilled someone so bright shares and rationalizes their views. The Harvard credential is key to his success.

958112459235082240 2018-01-29 22:59:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AshleyRParker So why do reporters continue to repeat White House quotes / information as if it deserves a tacit presumption of honesty? The WH lies nonstop about any question involving Trumps self-interest and/or controversy. TBC WP does this less than NYT, Politico, & Axios. cc @jdawsey1.
958103039600091136 2018-01-29 22:22:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion OK fine. You might also try Joe Arpaio and Courtland Sykes.
958101656570179584 2018-01-29 22:16:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion You are picking on people who dont really matter today / arent in power / wont assume power.
958100679444152320 2018-01-29 22:12:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion This is a major step up from taking on Paul Nehlen.
958098343401439232 2018-01-29 22:03:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BGrueskin Except Spicer willingly told the Presidents lies over and over, misleading the entire country, undermining peoples capability to distinguish truth from lies. Dont #BothSides this.
958080662493216768 2018-01-29 20:53:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeMadden Theres probably a better way to answer that question without tripping up SEc regulations 
958075474911010817 2018-01-29 20:32:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeMadden @Chopt Help us settle this argument - can you characterize how much business you do on Super Bowl Sunday?
958058549065609216 2018-01-29 19:25:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold Maybe Wray isnt being totally truthful.
958052881852084224 2018-01-29 19:03:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PressSec @ElizLanders But she lies so much why would you tweet out something like this which implies a presumption of truth?
958052554759290880 2018-01-29 19:01:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PressSec @peterbakernyt But she lies so much why would you tweet out something like this which implies a presumption of truth?
958052480125775872 2018-01-29 19:01:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JenniferJJacobs But she lies so much why would you tweet out something like this which implies a presumption of truth?

958051597447122944 2018-01-29 18:57:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AriFleischer @AprilDRyan @StephanieJ_DC yeah why
958050226408845313 2018-01-29 18:52:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @POTUS @davidaxelrod Why is that ironic?
958049932228804608 2018-01-29 18:51:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarkHarrisNYC Also theres only so much time to allocate on the show. Seems nuts to prioritize Sting over Lorde. Really the problem is that CBS is the wrong network. How many CBS viewers listen to Kendrick, Cardi B, Migos, etc.
958049527579082753 2018-01-29 18:49:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarkHarrisNYC Thats because in music, 95% of the best music released each year is created by young artists.
958044540325130240 2018-01-29 18:29:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baseballcrank Im sure Mueller will sort it out!
958031107198353408 2018-01-29 17:36:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows I mean, you know the answer. Conservative media and Republican office holders need a #BothSides distraction from Trumps evil, corruption, and personal despicableness... and the media needs to give the impression of balanced coverage.
958027701595521024 2018-01-29 17:22:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CillizzaCNN Chris where are you on applying relentless pressure on the RNC and Republicans to return money that Steve Wynn contributed?
958027189118582784 2018-01-29 17:20:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AriFleischer Ridiculous. You are a Trump shill. We obviously need this because theres a major threat that Trump fires Mueller to obstruct justice.
958024197963268096 2018-01-29 17:09:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeMadden I will bet you $10 that in 3yrs SB Sunday will be the biggest day of the year by far for all of these salad chains. @stevenjay you can referee this bet.
958023904601153536 2018-01-29 17:07:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @samstein Shouldnt baseline presumption be that Republicans are often liars and these type of criticisms are likely made in bad faith? I know this sounds obnoxious and heated, but why give Republican officials the presumption of honesty at this point.
958023451683430400 2018-01-29 17:06:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeMadden I myself avoid pizza & love Sweetgreen, & Id prefer to order SG separate from pizza order bc pizza places make mediocre salads. Im not trying to convince you to change your own taste, just that I think this ad is more indicative of where the future is headed than you may think.
958021962609012737 2018-01-29 17:00:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeMadden Low carb folks. Im confident that salad orders as part of bigger pizza orders have exploded over the past few years.
958021256892227584 2018-01-29 16:57:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeMadden Why do you think so? Lots of people dont want to eat pizza and carby stuff, even while watching games. Also, a lot of people watching the SB are extremely casual viewers.
958015145749364736 2018-01-29 16:33:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KPhed Peter Wehner also.
957827989072310273 2018-01-28 04:09:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion How do you know when someone in the Trump administration is telling the truth? Is there a tell?
957759877471879168 2018-01-28 23:38:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ive never retweeted Piers Morgan beforehttps://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/957624892173836297

957687152749395968 2018-01-28 18:49:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin Simply watching the woman who Trump cheated on his wife with four months after his son was born will be interesting. But sure you should watch the SOTU instead.
957682199024697344 2018-01-28 18:30:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker Its the main event that night
957680926137270274 2018-01-28 18:25:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> What are expectations for Stormy?https://twitter.com/normornstein/status/957494057634291712
957472056639016961 2018-01-27 04:35:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @levynews The lying
957462004062539777 2018-01-27 03:55:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kfury He doesnt mean it.
957385869240950784 2018-01-27 22:52:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT Except he fired Comey.
957385181240836096 2018-01-27 22:49:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonfavs #EqualTimeforStormy
957378111124852736 2018-01-27 22:21:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ktumulty @PhilipRucker I hope the Post gives equal time to the Stormy Daniels interview on @jimmykimmel.
957326151117975552 2018-01-27 18:55:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HillaryClinton @oliverdarcy If Hillary were being blackmailed by a powerful actor, I dont think it would matter much - vs Wynn, and obviously Trump.
957324499946414080 2018-01-27 18:48:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HillaryClinton @oliverdarcy I dont think she holds power, but I guess reasonable people can disagree (since, for example, you are reasonable).
957323670371758080 2018-01-27 18:45:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NumbersMuncher @ElBuehn To be clear, he *should* care because many voters think that sleeping with a porn star four months after your son is born is despicable. Hence paying her $130K and buying her silence. I agree Trump himself has no morals and is a narcissistic sociopath.
957323205496094720 2018-01-27 18:43:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HillaryClinton @oliverdarcy But given Wynn holds power & Hillary doesnt, & given that media & public attention is scarce > its not unreasonable to believe that the Wynn news (& the Stormy Daniels news) (& Trump ordering Mueller fires) deserves ++++ attention. The media is addicted to #BothSides narrative
957321631893929985 2018-01-27 18:37:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NumbersMuncher @ElBuehn If he doesnt give a crap about it, why did he pay Stormy $130k? Oh he cares.
957319412876378112 2018-01-27 18:28:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NumbersMuncher Also, do you have a take on Steve Wynn, the rapist who is running the RNCs finance arm and a close friend of the company?
957318277952282625 2018-01-27 18:23:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NumbersMuncher Super-important point! Curious - how do you feel about POTUS (the one currently in office) confidentially paying off a porn star a week b/4 the election, exposing himself to blackmail? And how much more blackmail exposure do you think he has - how many more settlements?
957314315710709760 2018-01-27 18:08:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Twitter @gabrieldance This is an incredible story.
957311074520375296 2018-01-27 17:55:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nikkihaley @singernews Curious - are you so pissed that Trump confidentially paid off a porn star a week b/4 the election, exposing himself to blackmail? I dont see tweets from you abt that. And how much more blackmail exposure do you think he has - how many more settlements?
957302986794983425 2018-01-27 17:23:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonathanvswan You seem like a good guy. Why are we talking about this / why is this news? H doesnt hold office & wont in the future. I know ppl enjoy reading abt H, & Rs relish the #BothSides demagoguing opp  but if you put on Marty Baron hat, dont you think we should talk < abt Hillary?
957110602240901121 2018-01-26 04:38:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ConorLambPA @GideonResnick Thats a yellow star.
957091439070003200 2018-01-26 03:22:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaketapper All press is good press!
957091249831333888 2018-01-26 03:21:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @adamjwhitedc Whatever. Dershowitz says wrong is right every day after his morning breakfast with Satan.
957060908689244160 2018-01-26 01:21:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Your people want racism. #whiteethnonationalism
957043600533016576 2018-01-26 00:12:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Its a reasonable look for Trump supporters
957041085775101952 2018-01-26 00:02:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol He is definitely not better than that.
957037933617299456 2018-01-26 23:49:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson We are also in this situation because corrupt is a moral-less, unethical, corrupt liar who believes in nothing at his core other than maximizing his own power and wealth.
957030798821023744 2018-01-26 23:21:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT @amychozick To be clear, your coverage of Hillarys emails in 2016 was terrible. Maggie didnt have anything to do with that. The reporters who obsessed over / screwed up the Hillary email story should take accountability, along with their editors and ultimately Dean Baquet.
956965714006491137 2018-01-26 19:03:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @MonsieurBobo Actually he did take action - he asked McGahn to fire Mueller.
956964965021184000 2018-01-26 19:00:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @realcarlossilva Not thinking - Trump told McGahn to have Mueller fired.
956964873698557952 2018-01-26 18:59:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @seanjbillings Not thinking. Trump told McGahn to fire Mueller.
956964424211771392 2018-01-26 18:57:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson One of those groups wants to commit violence against the other two.
956782024198520832 2018-01-25 06:53:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KristerJohnson @AprilDRyan Great work on the Trump staff meltdown thing. You are a national treasure.
956778589294231553 2018-01-25 06:39:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro Heres what Trump has done so far.https://twitter.com/markberman/status/956714676510916609
956764258334736385 2018-01-25 05:42:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @christinawilkie Do you think Stormy will talk about Trump?
956744412536565760 2018-01-25 04:23:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dandrezner @JRubinBlogger He is definitely not kidding. His followers *love* this stuff.
956744250711945222 2018-01-25 04:22:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> Bens followers really eat this stuff up.https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/956717723429605376
956742357763813377 2018-01-25 04:15:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Why do you think he admitted that his source told him something that contradicted his initial narrative?
956737958568124416 2018-01-25 03:57:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro You want to make light of the threat that Trump fires Mueller. Many of your followers like this, because they dont want to believe this threat is important or dangerous. You can insult me but I still dont understand why tonights news is a laughing matter.
956731836968742912 2018-01-25 03:33:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro This is absolute bullshit. You said Trumps just saying stuff. Thats clearly wrong. He wasnt just saying stuff. He wanted to fire Mueller.
956730307234934784 2018-01-25 03:27:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro I dont understand your purpose in posting jokey tweets like this.
956729211271565312 2018-01-25 03:23:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baseballcrank @RaynorLaw And this current president seems to be closely allied with antisemites! They all love Trump and think hes the best President ever. And Trump characterized Nazi marchers as fine people. But Obama took a picture with Farrakhan so who can tell the difference.
956697556263714816 2018-01-25 01:17:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FDRLST @cobracommandr15 @BlueBoxDave I cant remember. Lets come up with all the lies & unethical things he did. What about Fast & Furious and the IRS scandal? And Uranium One. Those were infuriating! Its not right to give away our uranium supply to the Russians. Only Fox News had the courage to stand up to Obama.
956694782226587648 2018-01-25 01:06:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FDRLST @cobracommandr15 @BlueBoxDave It was really upsetting when Obama said you could keep your doctor if you wanted to! Because that wasnt true. Why did he lie to all of us that way? Hes supposed to tell the truth but instead he was dishonest. That was not how Obamacare actually worked!
956692928465809408 2018-01-25 00:59:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin @Maidenberg Jared has to feed and water the 1-issue pro-Israel billionaires.
956691989293973504 2018-01-25 00:55:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> Look  Im presidenting!https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/956588348864454656
956688863824457728 2018-01-25 00:42:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FDRLST @cobracommandr15 @BlueBoxDave One example: lots of press criticism about surveillance, secrecy.   One problem w/this comparison is that Obama is a less despicable human being & president. No weekly stories about paying off porn stars, calling African countries shitholes, obstructing justice, etc.
956686770875199489 2018-01-25 00:34:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FDRLST @BlueBoxDave @cobracommandr15 Yep.
956684927554150401 2018-01-25 00:27:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BlueBoxDave In fairness, The Federalist is basically part of the Trump comms team. Journalists are supposed to be adversarial to power.
956658489664856064 2018-01-25 22:42:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper The lesson is that Trump & his henchmen are gaslighting propagandist Orwellian fascists. They do this over & over  whip up Fox News & Infowars viewers (who are unsophisticated) around a conspiracy theory & then quietly back off later without informing the dupes they lathered up.
956613943635554305 2018-01-25 19:45:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baseballcrank The other story this reminds me of is when Obama said you could keep you doctor even though that wasnt true!
956350681329238016 2018-01-24 02:19:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MichaelRWarren Mueller closing in further

956231978960826368 2018-01-24 18:27:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NicolleDWallace Heartbreaking? Hannity has been a corrupt scumbag for a long time now - #SethRich, #UraniumOne, #ReleaseTheMemo. We gotta stop pretending like hes a good guy, or dwell on how he was once a good guy. He is the most pernicious gaslighter in media.

956020437615509504 2018-01-23 04:26:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker @daveofthefuture @kingfish225 @AndyTheGiant Curious whether the Peloton critics on this thread have used it (regularly for some period of time).
955965790167089153 2018-01-23 00:49:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PreetBharara Sean Davis blocks me - what does the tweet say
955913316777381888 2018-01-23 21:21:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman Hannity and Fox News generally are the biggest perpetrators of this gaslighting bullshit.
955910943103320064 2018-01-23 21:11:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Also this https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/550502/
955910571550949377 2018-01-23 21:10:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion This is simply not correct. One senator can do a lot more to oppose Donald Trump. See  https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2018/1/4/16849584/cory-gardner-marijuana
955909671017054208 2018-01-23 21:06:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jameshohmann @BenSasse @ReaganBattalion More Ben Sasse talk. How about propose legislation repealing the tariff?
955884045749006336 2018-01-23 19:24:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DannyZuker Big Sick > Dunkirk?
955881307648679936 2018-01-23 19:13:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ShiraOvide SoftBank wont be vocal on this point in board meetings, Id bet. In fact, an interesting question is whether Uber makes the SB board member step out of the meeting when non-US markets are discussed, to the extent those conflict with competitors that SB is also an investor in.
955879252397707264 2018-01-23 19:05:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ShiraOvide I hear you. But SoftBank is clearly conflicted / offering a perspective that may not reflect solely whats in Ubers best interest. And Id expect Dara (and the rest of the Uber board) to ultimately ignore them.
955877955711848448 2018-01-23 19:00:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ShiraOvide Why a drama? SoftBank doesnt have much governance.
955851131049136128 2018-01-23 17:14:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @steph_bello these are some good takes
955848408136278016 2018-01-23 17:03:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SykesCharlie You gotta admit though its honest / authentic that he told the truth.
955700665145159685 2018-01-22 07:16:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danharmon You sound like Rick
955673392031588353 2018-01-22 05:27:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bariweiss How about: can you be a feminist and support Trump?
955601703247622144 2018-01-22 00:42:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jehorowitz Greenwald is basically a Trump supporter.
955599922744606720 2018-01-22 00:35:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion When you are finished with Jane Fonda you should take a few shots at Paul Nehlen and Michael Dukakis as well.
955594597022838784 2018-01-22 00:14:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HotlineJosh To be clear, sure yes we should all call out Paul Nehlen for being a nazi. But no one should take much moral credit for that.
955594422510481409 2018-01-22 00:13:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HotlineJosh But focusing on nut jobs & slamming them is unproductive. Many conservatives have virtue-signaled by criticizing extremists like Roy Moore and Nehlen, but the real test is whether they call out Trump and his racist mainstreamers - Stephen Miller, Tom Cotton, Tucker Carlson, etc
955587702274932738 2018-01-22 23:47:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HotlineJosh Paul Nehlen is not the real problem. The real problem is Trump, Fox News and other large-scale media and political forces that foment hate and racism.
955581581355175937 2018-01-22 23:22:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rupertmurdoch @danprimack I would gladly trade FB not having WSJ content in return for no Fox News. The evil perpetrated by Fox News is underestimated.
955572460467896320 2018-01-22 22:46:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rupertmurdoch @danprimack Fox News is the most pernicious, dishonest, hate-baiting large-scale news outlet worldwide. It would be incredible for humanity if Fox News pulled its content from FB in some kind of misguided attempt at brinksmanship.
955536252140335104 2018-01-22 20:22:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AriFleischer When you say unnecessary roughness you mean like calling African countries shitholes?
955170194892103680 2018-01-21 20:08:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ianbremmer If your view is that Trumps presidency is a global catastrophic crisis and that hes an evil racist misogynist ethnonationalist - seems proportionate
955000846680379393 2018-01-21 08:55:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jimgeraghty The leader of your party is an incorrigible liar and cant be trusted.

954969597546868736 2018-01-20 06:51:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jtes This post is too empathetic toward the dad, who supports a racist / misogynist.
954919840153665536 2018-01-20 03:33:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCostTWS During a discussion about LGBTQ rights, the President motioned to Mr Pence and said: Dont ask that guyhe wants to hang them all!  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mike-pence-trump-hang-gay-people-joke-visitors-white-house-vp-a8003321.html?amp

If Trump&co had control they would move terribly against the press, against LBGT folks, against African-American voting rights. They would move against DOJ, undermine civil rights & checks/balances. Simply not true if Ds had keys.

954146242363183104 2018-01-18 00:19:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson Obama seems even better during a week where we learn that Trump had sex with a porn star 4 months after having a baby & paid her $130K to stay quiet & then he & his personal attorney lied about it. Also feels good after a week where Trump called African countries shitholes.

953865733150187520 2018-01-17 05:44:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nntaleb @naval @homertherat @can Twitter is filled with conservatives and right-wing people, including those from whatever constitutes the mainstream right as well as many on the alt-right. If you follow conservatives, thats what your timeline looks like.
953864717323313152 2018-01-17 05:40:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> Polished, elite Republicans want to look the other way, and pretend that they dont know that their followers include many thugs and racists.https://twitter.com/leahmcelrath/status/953808572382613507

953819868809187328 2018-01-17 02:42:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytopinion @dskok The polarization reflects, in part, deep dissatisfaction with the New York Times and its approach to covering this President - going back to the Times 2016 election coverage, which was disgraceful.

953714568772988928 2018-01-17 19:44:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion With his non-stop lying, Trump has earned an overwhelming presumption of dishonesty. I have never even heard of a person who lies this much and makes others lie so much on his behalf.
953714235397193728 2018-01-17 19:42:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Also theres no way Trump weighs 239lbs; if thats a lie, then why cant other parts of the report be a lie? This president has zero problem lying about anything. In this case, it seems like he wants to avoid being categorized as obese, and hes on the edge at 63 + 239 lbs.
953713757464666112 2018-01-17 19:40:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Tom Cotton has an impeccable record and he is clearly lying. Many other examples like this. Seems like quite a few people who work with Trump degrade themselves and become ccasional liars.
953711031938727936 2018-01-17 19:30:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Noahpinion Its not so much that the fringe has seized power; rather, the fringe is now GOP mainstream. Look at who supports people like Tom Cotton, etc.

953690576653754368 2018-01-17 18:08:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @USA_Not_Oceania Is this true? Will Trumps base be generally pleased about this?
953690329466552320 2018-01-17 18:07:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @Blake_View Had sex with a porn star 4 months after his wife delivered their son, then paid her $130k to keep it quiet.
953689786660749312 2018-01-17 18:05:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro Thats self-fulfilling. People like you could choose to care and influence your audience.

953433272289083392 2018-01-16 01:06:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias @michaelrwolfe You know that Obama once said that if you wanted to keep your doctor you could keep your doctor.

953405705301540866 2018-01-16 23:16:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @clairewillett B/c if the dr lied about Trumps medical data, it casts doubt on other stuff the dr said. Btw this dr is supposed to be very trustworthy, so its definitely news if he lied. And anyway the president and/or his doctor lying about his weight *is* news > there shouldnt be taboos.
953402667585294336 2018-01-16 23:04:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO @burtlikko wounding to his ego is a subset of very sensitive
953399992928026626 2018-01-16 22:54:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO If the 239 is a lie then I am led to wonder what else isnt true. This president has created an environment where we are led to suspect that anything sensitive said by himself or his henchmen may be a lie.
953397390865608705 2018-01-16 22:43:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @clairewillett The fat-shaming is awful, but pointing out that 239 is probably a lie is important.
953395378665144321 2018-01-16 22:35:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @yashar Since everything sensitive-topic-related coming from Trump & WH is a lie > I get why people are skeptical. Trump & no one else is responsible for an environment where no one believes a word he says. We assume he corrupts everyone around him, no matter their integrity before.
953394652970868736 2018-01-16 22:32:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @yashar So you think 239 is legit?
953394521617788928 2018-01-16 22:32:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Yair_Rosenberg The main constructive point is that 239 is probably false (visibly likely false), casting doubt on the whole medical public report.
953387157665726464 2018-01-16 22:03:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @zackbeauchamp It *is* about the lying. Saying his weight is 239lbs is visibly false. So if reporters establish that that is likely false, it casts doubt on everything else about Trumps medical report.

953063338866429954 2018-01-15 00:36:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @cascamike @AJentleson Right, but putting aside policies (and there I agree with you), Flake and 1-2 other GOP senators could proactively do as Vox / Fallows suggest to save our country. Not complex; just requires courage and putting country over party.
953044926891155456 2018-01-15 23:23:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @cascamike @AJentleson I dont begrudge Flake and McCain their policy votes, but they could - if they wanted - take steps to actually constrain Trump. As a result they seem like cowards to me.

952596798765285377 2018-01-14 17:42:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion I wonder if this type of thing (along w Trumps 40 mins of Twitter silence) is why people are so angry & associate the Hawaii mess w Trump. General dishonesty & incompetence on the part of the WH doesnt help make people feel safe during a time of international & domestic turmoil

Having said this, the recent obsequiousness and Steele dossier gaslighting has been very painful to watch. Graham has definitely become a Trump normalizer, at a minimum.
952233693933854721 2018-01-13 17:39:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JWGOP Why do you think private disagreement matters/has impact? Trump has no shame and couldnt care less what people say to him privately. I dont mean to be cynical, but Graham has become a total enabler from what I can see  doesnt look like hed blink an eye if Trump fired Mueller

951903008471699456 2018-01-12 19:45:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> Graham did *zero* good in privately chiding Trump while remaining publicly silent. This was just virtue signaling. Trump is a hard-core racist who wont change his mind on these topics, ever. He doesnt gaf what Graham thinks. Public condemnation is the *only* useful thing to do.https://twitter.com/reaganbattalion/status/951899978405961728
951900974326493185 2018-01-12 19:37:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorDurbin @ReaganBattalion Thats true, of course, but Graham gets no benefit of the doubt re Trump. He is one of Trumps biggest enablers. And it is not unreasonable to expect US leaders to condemn Trumps hateful language.
951865538296274944 2018-01-12 17:16:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @karol @SethAMandel A simpler theory is that hes just a racist who thinks less of non-white people.
951849270021259264 2018-01-12 16:12:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BecketAdams Regardless of intent, what you have achieved here is that many of your followers now doubt that Trump said shithole; you have given them rationale for believing the shithole comment is fake news. This is what many of your followers want - fuel for  fake news confirmation bias.
951846502581731330 2018-01-12 16:01:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @dipbait When you say you agree with Ben on the second point, do you really? I ask because the sentence that follows (about merit-based immigration) has nothing to do with the second point. You seem mostly focused on Bens first point, which is exactly the reason I posted my reply.
951845771871047681 2018-01-12 15:58:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @benandreas369 You are not a racist if you hang out and date black ppl. Literally no one reasonable feels this way. Ben - do you agree with this?
951844398622433280 2018-01-12 15:52:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @benandreas369 I still dont understand why these pictures demonstrate that Trump is not a racist  can you explain more? Im genuinely curious?
951843179111706624 2018-01-12 15:47:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @benandreas369 Because there was a time where Trump met with three African-Americans?
951841432133709825 2018-01-12 15:40:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro You own how Fox News uses/edits your content. It is completely predictable that they would emphasize the profanity point and underplay the racist point. Stop doing Fox News or take ownership for their spin.
951841101870059526 2018-01-12 15:39:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro Spending any time making point #1 is inexcusable. Your follower base is *filled* with people who dont agree with pt #2 -> you should focus on helping them. Any emphasis on pt #1 allows your & Trumps racist followers to rationalize their view that Trump wasnt being racist.
951685376887873536 2018-01-11 05:20:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro I think racism is the top-line issue tonight. Focusing on anything else sounds like you are minimizing the importance of the racism.

951581398644633600 2018-01-11 22:27:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker Its the only thing that matters. People should be judged by whether they are publicly vocal declaring this.
951575940647108608 2018-01-11 22:05:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold No I dont think Trump means that countries where people are predominantly white are shithole countries.
951574169203834880 2018-01-11 21:58:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz @JamesGellert I see.
951572857632342016 2018-01-11 21:53:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesGellert I dont think Trump said that sentence.
951572473597669376 2018-01-11 21:52:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HayesBrown Im gonna stick with racism as the most important takeaway.

951536308056477696 2018-01-11 19:28:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Noahpinion I think its hard to evaluate this question until there is a Democratic nominee to demonize. Sure Trumps not perfect but hes a lot better than X!

951526183635599360 2018-01-11 18:48:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jimgeraghty Well, you have Tucker Carlson espousing Trumps/Bannons race/hate-baiting in a friendlier, more presentable way. So clearly it can be done.
951499621246709760 2018-01-11 17:02:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Heres a theory that may help: The Federalist publishes many more lies than other publications.https://twitter.com/jamiesonweaver/status/951480758727839745

951301694352052224 2018-01-10 03:56:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @conor64 I stand by this assessment.
951254230471294976 2018-01-10 00:47:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @conor64 My read: - Harper's fc'er called X to say "I have article that mentions you" - If Roiphe cared re sensitivity/getting consent carefully, she would have called X herself to ask for it - As Roiphe didn't do this, if I were X, II wouldn't be confident re the consent armwaving now
951249992399728640 2018-01-10 00:30:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @conor64 Also- the original intent was that the person *would* be named So people going batshit *was* reasonable.pic.twitter.com/Fv51ilUKYT
951248085065150464 2018-01-10 00:23:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BlueBoxDave What Trump said: a lot of those anchors sent us letters saying that was one of the greatest meetings theyve ever witnessed.  Presumably thats a lie.
951245278698328064 2018-01-10 00:12:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel Not nearly so much as the success of Fox News.
951236352049266688 2018-01-10 23:36:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Where is the Trump hate hole? Is this a DC thing?
951214079783321600 2018-01-10 22:08:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @conor64 Its a tricky thing because if she were working on this story, shed likely reveal it without any advanced warning. So you can understand people reacting strongly to a rumor.
951201448188035072 2018-01-10 21:17:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NewWayCA Awesome. OK fair enough. Count me as a follower.
951200466687295488 2018-01-10 21:13:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NewWayCA You cant be serious. Is this ironic? Racism and racist appeals have dominated Republican politics for 50+ years. This seems simply inaccurate.
951200465789702144 2018-01-10 21:13:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rgoodlaw Why?
951188597662670848 2018-01-10 20:26:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ErikLoomis @fawfulfan Thats the wrong interpretation of the book. Right interp is closer to: the probs of white working class ppl are super important; they have it really bad; lets focus on their needs, not Afr-Americans. Solutions not needed as long as you dont also express empathy for black ppl.

951160693251702784 2018-01-10 18:35:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold This is consistent w/ hypothesis that Trump is a consistent liar whose word cant be trusted esp when (1) he is defending himself against accusations or (2) he is making claims about his accomplishments. Theres no reason for ppl to give him benefit of the doubt on truth telling.
950959825696931840 2018-01-09 05:17:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCostTWS I wonder if Trump has early stage dementia

950906810843590656 2018-01-09 01:47:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baseballcrank I decided to reply to your tweet instead of quote-tweet it. It does seem to me that what you are describing is racism.
950905522223439872 2018-01-09 01:41:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baseballcrank Just say racism
950877196238831616 2018-01-09 23:49:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO Plus Cromwell took advantage of his supporters hatred of women, African-Americans, and Jews to bolster his clients power base.

950866313634660352 2018-01-09 23:06:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianbeutler The article indicates he has legal incentives to stay (?)

950852237068087296 2018-01-09 22:10:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dandrezner Au contraire. Trump is going to Davis to yell at elites and make it clear to these globalist money people (read: Jews) that America comes first; this will be a nice emotional payout for Trump's base supporters.
950847160140013568 2018-01-09 21:50:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanEggenWPost @costareports Funny how no one thinks being a racist or anti-semite-sympathizer was part of the problem.

950790520632061952 2018-01-09 18:04:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi I havent thought about policy. Refusing to enforce Russian sanctions comes to mind.
950790142104514560 2018-01-09 18:03:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi Lying about Obama wiretapping him; calling Russian electoral interference claims by IC lies; general nonstop lying to public; false claim about inauguration crowd size; repeatedly attacking Sessions for recusing himself  all of this is just off the top of my head quickly
950789573076045824 2018-01-09 18:01:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi Firing Comey; whipping up sentiment against DOJ/Mueller; threatening to lock up opponent; expressing sympathy for Nazi marchers; claiming he can&should be able to control DOJ; collaboration with Fox News/state media, including tacit support of Uranium One & Seth Rich lies... /1
950788297755889665 2018-01-09 17:56:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson Theres a counter argument that he will divide the kook vote which is good for Rs - thoughts?
950780998274375680 2018-01-09 17:27:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jeremycyoung This is super insightful. What do you think about the risks re her promotion of medical quackery, anti-vaccination nuts, Dr. Phil, etc.
950597340192063489 2018-01-08 05:17:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianstelter @Karoli I mean, this isnt a crazy view and many people share it.
950595455175413760 2018-01-08 05:09:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol I dont see how you can be too earnest given what Republicans have foisted on us.
950592465421025280 2018-01-08 04:57:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattdizwhitlock Trump wanted Hatch to stay, badly, but hes leaving. And the guy who will succeed him is a Trump enemy.
950573272227135488 2018-01-08 03:41:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom The Times needed that opinion to fill out the monthly mosaic.
950547058888392704 2018-01-08 01:57:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol @JBWolfsthal I mean, this type of attitude doesnt help win a big fight, but you do you.
950537566461206529 2018-01-08 01:19:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RMac18 This is exactly right. What time is halftime roughly?
950534346040950784 2018-01-08 01:07:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin Progressives want to clear a path for Bernie and any hot candidate who may reduce his chances for victory is an enemy.
950533496505745408 2018-01-08 01:03:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin Signals that the person considers themselves a progressive.
950531407817842689 2018-01-08 00:55:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter red roses have the knives out for Oprah > any candidate who can stop Bernie must be stoppedhttps://twitter.com/justincharity/status/950528242775199744
950525831796805632 2018-01-08 00:33:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JBWolfsthal Totally disagree. People make mistakes and we need allies. Nobody has shown more courage among conservative writers than Bill Kristol. Purity tests arent a good way to execute on the top-level goal, which is getting rid of Trump.
950506915334795264 2018-01-08 23:18:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Justin_Vogt Wants to be Secretary of State?
950505908139737090 2018-01-08 23:14:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RichLowry @oliverdarcy My sense is that Trump himself effectively has a hiring and firing veto re Fox News. Another recent example is Dershowitz and Ari Fleischer getting a TV show. Kiss the ring or dont get a job. Trumps regulatory leverage probably helps provide this level of influence.
950501863186563072 2018-01-08 22:57:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Dont forget about David Clarke, Omarosa, Don King, and the African-American guy with the placard at Trump rallies.
950486790653161472 2018-01-08 21:58:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytopinion Havent you done enough work on Trump supporters? How about covering people who oppose Trump or who are threatened by Trump?
950469852824653825 2018-01-08 20:50:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @msandbergMD @eliotwb @ooshma Awesome - really appreciate you getting back to me. OK are definitely going to try it out. @rabois has good taste in new stuff.

950467590886891520 2018-01-08 20:41:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT This seems self-serving and doesn't address any of the specific reasons why people have doubts about his mental health.
950466046275698688 2018-01-08 20:35:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @msandbergMD @eliotwb @rabois @ooshma Got it. Putting aside "no added sugar," what about sugar, period? My family prefers sugar/carb-minimal meals. Do you offer those?
950465849835503616 2018-01-08 20:34:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @msandbergMD @eliotwb @rabois @ooshma Thanks! What's the answer about sugar in the meals? Do you offer very-low-sugar . / very low-carbs options?
950461006395748352 2018-01-08 20:15:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel I'm not an anonyrando, but I'd still like to know who funds The Federalist.
950458298439933953 2018-01-08 20:04:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro For example, Alex Jones says that Sandy Hook was a hoax.
950458207280840704 2018-01-08 20:04:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro Agree. Do you feel this way and articulate such strong views about Sean Hannity and Alex Jones? Isnt it a big priority for us to persuade powerful Republicans to drive these two liars off the air?
950453830986039296 2018-01-08 19:47:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BuzzFeedBen She seems like one of the only candidates who can stop the Bernie train.
950449650753929216 2018-01-08 19:30:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mckaycoppins @brianefallon Mmm, but he won. If you don't win, the lingering negatives / loser-vibe seems pretty bad. Not insurmountable, but still - yuk. Hillary, Kerry, McCain, Mondale.
950443923033358336 2018-01-08 19:07:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @matthewjdowd Cmon - you know the answers. Im sure Mussolinis supporters didnt care about the truth either.
950436120633868288 2018-01-08 18:36:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eliotwb @rabois @msandbergMD asks: are their meals low in sugar / no sugar?

950427662786482176 2018-01-08 18:03:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion I dont understand this tweet. If a NeverTrumper believes that the most important national priority is getting rid of Trump (ie because hes a fascist threat to our system of government and liberties), then rooting for the most electable Dem candidate is rational.
950411582021894146 2018-01-08 16:59:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RonBrownstein What explains Rs getting closer to Trump, even the ones who previously opposed him (Graham, Corker)? Youd think Corker in particular could have an opportunity for statesmanship.
950404022627782656 2018-01-08 16:29:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dorseyshaw My inference -> Bill Kristol has *huge* integrity. His #1 priority for America is that we get rid of Trump, and he wants Dems to pick a winner.
950397241516175360 2018-01-08 16:02:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MattGlassman312 But only one of them is a racist misogynist fascist willing to do anything to accumulate power and wealth.
950385873564004352 2018-01-08 15:17:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianstelter @MelissaAFrancis I dont understand why you think Brians points are hysterical - which ones, and why?
950241135913398272 2018-01-07 05:41:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows We need winners who are authentic and connect with people. Right now thats just Bernie. Oprah could be great.
950203949037977601 2018-01-07 03:14:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CNNSotu @ArdenFarhi @mdornic Maybe you *should* clarify this since you are a news outlet and this is an important story about which you have proprietary info. cc @jaketapper

950192854046920704 2018-01-07 02:30:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @steve_vladeck How is it possible for an educated person to miss this distinction? The words are long and neither is obscure.
950191107651981312 2018-01-07 02:23:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NickMiroff This post feels off-key; how could you could publish such a long bio story on Kelly & not mention the chaos in the WH. The Wolff book is *obvious* context - shouldnt you ask whether Kelly is doing a good job in light of what we have learned? I dont see how you could ignore this

950030848165789696 2018-01-07 15:46:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO I know, of course, and I dont mean to imply otherwise. Im just saying, Bannon gravedancing shouldnt obscure the reality that Trump was the client here and was benefiting from Bannons tactics long before Bannon joined up.

949453451167059969 2018-01-05 01:31:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCostTWS Sounds like Trump has major reading problems.
949451254299746304 2018-01-05 01:23:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench @KT_So_It_Goes David, the more I think about it, the more Im concerned that you are underweighting the Trump corruption risk here. Evan McMullin has this right:https://twitter.com/evan_mcmullin/status/949446407500500992
949440992318447616 2018-01-05 00:42:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MattMackowiak Not as telling as every Republican Congressman doing nothing to slow Trumps corruption / subversion of US political institutions.
949427248242704385 2018-01-05 23:47:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nickstatt @CaseyNewton This is a really good article.
949425996196802560 2018-01-05 23:42:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @summerbrennan OK - very sorry. Im curious - do you think I should have known this ahead of time? You didnt say that, but Im interested. I moderate online communities for a living and I like understanding how norms like this work.
949423228363001856 2018-01-05 23:31:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BlueBoxDave Hes a genius!
949420578670194689 2018-01-05 23:21:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KT_So_It_Goes @DavidAFrench Graham hasnt flip-flopped on Trump. Hes become a breathtakingly enthusiastic brown-noser who sees no wrong in Trump  astounding given how awful Trump is & given how independent Graham used to be. I assume Graham wants to be Secretary of State & that drives *all* his behavior.
949419395461214208 2018-01-05 23:16:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench @KT_So_It_Goes Also David I think you are ignoring my point about Trump persistently trying to weaken DOJs independence.
949419195078356992 2018-01-05 23:15:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench @KT_So_It_Goes Yeah I cant imagine any reason to give Lindsey Graham benefit of the doubt here but David French knows more about politics than me.
949418988542443521 2018-01-05 23:15:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Fair enough. For my own purposes, Im comfortable assuming that Grassley and Graham have abandoned their principles and are only Trump supplicants.
949417887252455424 2018-01-05 23:10:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Its not reasonable to 1/watch Trump weaken & attack DOJ, then 2/watch DT & his toadies pressure DOJ to investigate his political enemies, & then 3/argue hey lets just let DOJ do its thing & let the chips fall where they may. Do you trust Trumps EDNY USA to not be a scumbag?
949417011112652800 2018-01-05 23:07:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench But this supposes that the DOJ is independent and strong. Its increasingly under pressure from Trump and his rectum sniffers.

949416095189880832 2018-01-05 23:03:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Bottom line: nobody trusts Graham & Grassley to do right thing. Well never have the info they do, but after watching (1) Nunes etc politicize/attack Russia investigation and (2) GOP leaders (even Graham) stick their nose up Trumps rectum > doubting R intentions seems prudent.
949413565709959168 2018-01-05 22:53:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanaHoule I'd go for stupid
949399171538108417 2018-01-05 21:56:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> But why not even *try* to enforce rules on Trump? Why give him completely free pass on violence/hate? Choice doesnt have to be ban or dont ban. Could be: multiple warnings followed by short blocks. TWTR is rationalizing why they wont even risk losing Trump to enforce civility.https://twitter.com/cwarzel/status/949389692037865472
949385277314748416 2018-01-05 21:01:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Tracinski @ReaganBattalion Wishful thinking. Roy Moore wasnt a Bannon creation. Trumpism only is stopped when Trump is stopped. Trump himself is the epicenter of the racism, hatred, misogyny, anti-semitism wink-winking.
949381751163383809 2018-01-05 20:47:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarcusReports I wonder if hes concerned that his Commander in Chief has dementia.

949359917718056960 2018-01-05 19:20:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @renato_mariotti A related motive is Grassley and Graham wanting to ingratiate themselves with Dementia Don

949109660669235202 2018-01-04 02:45:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HeerJeet @Patterico You should quote-tweet me so we can see if your followers agree with you.
949109416388775937 2018-01-04 02:44:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Patterico @HeerJeet Another problem is that right wing media often works hard to write/produce stuff that looks racism-free but which the audience knows is really racist - wink wink etc. Breitbart, Trump, Tucker Carlson - its an art-form.
949108259381690368 2018-01-04 02:40:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Patterico sloppy but mistakes happen sounds pretty close to ok. Regardless, this is a public discussion and readers can judge whether @HeerJeets characterization is fair. Doesnt make sense to call him a liar.
949105797006467072 2018-01-04 02:30:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @LizMair @mckaycoppins To me, it made Romney look like a patriot - someone willing to eat shit with a piece of garbage because it might have been the best thing for the country.

949093518068219906 2018-01-04 01:41:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Oh also this bit probably doesnt reflect well on Sessionshttps://twitter.com/ddale8/status/949080501163384832
949093242162724865 2018-01-04 01:40:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Hes the Attorney General - those are  table stakes. Other senior DOJ people seem to quietly maintain their integrity without people thinking we should throw a party.
949081739632164865 2018-01-04 00:54:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jdawsey1 Im a critic and the piece is good.
949080337941913600 2018-01-04 00:49:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @emilybell The Washington Post doesnt need to bend itself into ass-kissing contortions to get news. Clearly a wide range of strategies are useful across outlets, but that doesnt mean the New York Times has to let Trump walk all over them.
949077113604251649 2018-01-04 00:36:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman Seems alarmist and oversimplifies the content of the post.
949076727417815040 2018-01-04 00:34:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman Do you have a view on the photo used at the top of the article?
949074358005260288 2018-01-04 00:25:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheLeadCNN @PetsRockHMB Do you think Trump really has neurosyphilis? Im gathering data points.
949072903089274880 2018-01-04 00:19:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> Scary. I wonder if the neurosyphilis rumors are true. Seems like Trump has serious cognitive problems, and we know he was sexually promiscuous.https://twitter.com/timothynoah1/status/949072044276310017
949072351315951616 2018-01-04 00:17:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaketapper @exjon How did he make you unfollow him?
949068344887410688 2018-01-04 00:01:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianstelter Do you suspect Trump has neurosyphilis?
949066533535297536 2018-01-04 23:54:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom If he does have neurosyphilis, then I guess thats a temperament problem, but more in the sense of dog temperament.
949065641373257731 2018-01-04 23:50:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Agreed. Im pretty skeptical about the neurosyphilis rumors. I dont even know what neurosyphilis is - how can I judge whether Trump has it, even if many of his behaviors are troublingly consistent, including past sexual promiscuity?
949063182726856704 2018-01-04 23:41:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KaraCalavera I feel like this tweet forecloses the opportunity for you and Rebekah Mercer to mend fences.
949061167145783296 2018-01-04 23:33:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel Better yet would be if Republicans didnt elect such a horrible narcissist as President.
949052625558806529 2018-01-04 22:59:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ComfortablySmug Im grateful he gave us Roy Moore though
949047233520975872 2018-01-04 22:37:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @joshuaforman @RadioFreeTom This type of approach is finehttp://amp.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article181063706.html
949046468601511937 2018-01-04 22:34:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @joshuaforman @RadioFreeTom I get it. But IMO super-aggro R gerrymandering + black voter suppression> fundamentally unrepresentative outcomes. Well agree to disagree. TBC I dont think most R pols dislike black ppl but huge % of base does & its useful to inflame bases hatred. Anti-AA policies -> twofer.
949043794082545664 2018-01-04 22:24:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @joshuaforman @RadioFreeTom Which Federalist Paper lays out the 3/5 thing?
949043095772979200 2018-01-04 22:21:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @joshuaforman @RadioFreeTom That seems like it would take a long time. Would watching Hamilton work?
949041932101074944 2018-01-04 22:16:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BuzzFeedBen You are our only hope.
949035089014398976 2018-01-04 21:49:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BuzzFeedBen who funds The Federalist?
949033268938129408 2018-01-04 21:42:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @joshuaforman @RadioFreeTom OK fine. But you should know this reminds me of when NYTimes reporters (eg Peter Baker) complain that their TL is filled with people saying that they should have viciously attacked Trump in some interview, when in fact many reasonable people are arguing something in the middle.
949032969716473856 2018-01-04 21:41:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @RadioFreeTom Kobach is favored R candidate to be Kansas governor, and he is very close to Trump. They've appeared together many times, and Trump appointed him to run a commission that was a Trump priority. That counts as R mainstream these days, or certainly that counts as "not a kook."
949032459403894784 2018-01-04 21:39:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @joshuaforman @RadioFreeTom You're a reasonable guy & I appreciate your args. However, I think "the increasingly popular view that Rs invented gerrymandering" is a strawman. I don't hear credible Ds making this argument. If they are, they shouldn't. I don't hear Obama & Eric Holder saying it, for example.
949031954673844224 2018-01-04 21:37:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom @davidharsanyi Is it Mercer? That's my bet but I've hedged with a small Paul Singer bet.
949031519607115776 2018-01-04 21:35:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom @davidharsanyi I'll tell you the name of my family member if you tell me who funds The Federalist!
949031402808340480 2018-01-04 21:34:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @RadioFreeTom Kobach isn't a kook, nor is Trump electoral fraud commission -> Rs have resisted neither. I'm less inclined to find friendly middle ground w/Rs who have bad intentions re black voting. Yes I'm aware Jefferson owned slaves & the 1960 election was fixed. Doesn't change my view.
949030588014460928 2018-01-04 21:31:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @RadioFreeTom I hear you, but there's a key related pt - Rs have been obsessed with disenfranchising African-American voters for past 40+ yrs. I have a wealthy distant relative in the MW who devoted 2 yrs of his life to deterring black people from voting in WI. Many similar efforts/examples
949029528491376641 2018-01-04 21:27:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @aseitzwald While we're at it, can we get a map of all of Moore's Jewish friends?
949028345743753216 2018-01-04 21:22:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @RadioFreeTom Getting rid of every amendment after the Tenth would eliminate many problems.  Roy Moore
949027113595621376 2018-01-04 21:17:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @RadioFreeTom But clearly its fair game for Democrats like me to accuse Republicans of racially targeting African-Americans, right? And to characterize their voter suppression efforts as racist? Im just exercising my 1A rights in a vigorous political debate.
949025517801320448 2018-01-04 21:11:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @RadioFreeTom Im guessing you in Massachusetts didnt singularly target one racial group to minimize their vote counting, like Republicans do. Also I bet you didnt support voter suppression efforts, etc. Republicans have taken suppression of African-American influence to a whole new level.

949022492177281024 2018-01-04 20:59:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold Because it would be super upsetting if they tried to impose Sharia law on us.
949022355187105792 2018-01-04 20:58:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold Did the comments have anything interesting to say about Sharia law?
949010823296331776 2018-01-04 20:13:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RichCordray Why so low?
949004796341624832 2018-01-04 19:49:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jdawsey1 Sorry I think Politico is more comfortable with their spin is frequently inaccurate.
949004617152569344 2018-01-04 19:48:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jdawsey1 I think the White House may be lying!
949004430287953922 2018-01-04 19:47:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson @ymp_5000 @Mattfobrien Also Fast and Furious

948989786487906304 2018-01-04 18:49:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mattfobrien @EWErickson @ymp_5000 Do you remember when Obama said that if you wanted to keep your doctor you could keep your doctor?

948983251372097537 2018-01-04 18:23:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo Trump's base hates African-Americans and perceives that moving against marijuana will put more AAs in jail and make AAs unhappy - which makes them happy. @Noahpinion - I assume you agree with this.
948972665636704256 2018-01-04 17:41:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Whats your reaction to this?https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/4/16849584/cory-gardner-marijuana
948955839720599553 2018-01-04 16:34:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson Yeah what a blockbuster outcome for the author. The smartest move was disclosing the existence of tapes only after 24 hours of firestorm and denials.
948954433630515201 2018-01-04 16:29:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ComfortablySmug @TheStalwart Lets hope Senator Moore isnt molesting someone involved in the process. 
948950558534115328 2018-01-04 16:13:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HeerJeet @Patterico Murdoch himself operates the biggest racist media company ever. Good enough for me to call him a racist even if he has black friends.
948950413285339136 2018-01-04 16:13:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HeerJeet @Patterico Can we call Hannity & Tucker Carlson racists? Sure they themselves dont say we hate African-Americans, but they systematically & unfairly target AAs-> aimed at pleasing their racist audience. White supremacist groups love Tucker - good enough or do we need a smoking gun?
948944015130439680 2018-01-04 15:47:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom @teddygoff I stole that from @TheRickWilson. The Bob Rubin rule is that I must credit Rick 3x and then I can just steal it.
948942770168721410 2018-01-04 15:42:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mattfobrien @EWErickson Thats a charitable characterization :)
948942446733410304 2018-01-04 15:41:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Its the most efficient way to disenfranchise African-Americans at-scale while also pleasing the cousin-curious base.
948942194869600256 2018-01-04 15:40:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mattfobrien @EWErickson So you think the Trump administration feel strongly about the importance of rule of law?
948942089017901058 2018-01-04 15:39:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson Lecturing about rule of law during the Trump administration is rich. Cant you let this guy go; Flynn is a good guy.
948930681945571328 2018-01-04 14:54:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro @SoCalCMH Go away Hillary? Shes not to blame for not going away. Its Fox News and Trump himself who obsessively bring her up.
948930405381517312 2018-01-04 14:53:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion @LionLiberty Well, Trumps former campaign manager and national security advisor have both been indicted  that ranks it as a top 1/2 special counsel investigation so far.
948803599152197633 2018-01-03 06:29:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion @LionLiberty My point is that he is a liar who cant be trusted to truthfully answer controversial questions, especially those that are intimately tied to his self-interest. Im not going to fire Mueller - worthless / totally unreliable.
948767946632962049 2018-01-03 04:08:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro This point is so obvious I dont understand how you could ignore it.
948766990784610304 2018-01-03 04:04:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro Not nearly as amazing as how much the media (Fox News esp) still covers & attacks Hillary. What you observe is a logical consequence of this. If you had fond feelings for Hillary & used to work for her, wouldnt you want to defend her in the face of Fox News bullshit?
948721614736142338 2018-01-03 01:03:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CaseyNewton Zero chance.
948721417016586240 2018-01-03 01:03:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @LionLiberty I don't trust that Trump is telling the truth. I'm new to the @ReaganBattalion community. Do the folks here generally believe that Trump can be trusted when he says something?
948716357687721984 2018-01-03 00:43:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion toady
948716007576621056 2018-01-03 00:41:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion How about: - Join efforts to restrict Trumps ability to fire Mueller  - Vote against confirming Giulianis today as the new USA for SDNY and against similar appointees  If 2-3 R Senators did this, Senate control would flip on Trump accountability issues.
948684885962575874 2018-01-03 22:37:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion @LibsRIdiots1963 Also, the Duke Lacrosse team did not rape that girl! Infuriating. Also Fast and Furious.
948668366591442944 2018-01-03 21:32:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allahpundit Good reporters get sources to say stupid shit. Look at McChrystal dumping on Obama to Rolling Stone.
948663671474946048 2018-01-03 21:13:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TimothyNoah1 Gross, weird  unempathetic verging on awful. What has Hillary done to earn this kind of thing? Maybe Hillary content still drives PVs at Politico?
948659874967076864 2018-01-03 20:58:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion @LibsRIdiots1963 Did you know that Obama said that if you wanted to keep your doctor you could keep your doctor?
948659730184003585 2018-01-03 20:57:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion OK fine we arent that far apart. I view her as a fascist propagandist / modern-day Goebbels, but tomato tomato. I agree her performance evaluations will be glowing.
948658259803557888 2018-01-03 20:52:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Ah I see. And do you think she is a lying piece of trash?
948657522495315968 2018-01-03 20:49:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Im saying Huckabee is good at her job is a statement that normalizes Orwellian authoritarianism and that, as a loyal fan, Ive come to expect you to hold people to higher standards.
948656676994916352 2018-01-03 20:45:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion I get that she lies because it what she needs to do to represent Trumps preferences. Trump is the problem.
948656484442832897 2018-01-03 20:45:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion She is clearly one of the biggest liars that has ever had a high-profile role in the executive branch, certainly in my adult lifetime / since Nixon. Trump himself is a bigger liar and Spicer is up there. It is normalizing to suggest that shes just like other press secretaries.
948592554655674368 2018-01-03 16:31:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jmartNYT @danpfeiffer I hear you. But his May 2016 speech castigating Trump was impressive & my sense is that standing strong against Trump is his play for the history books. I dont begrudge him enlightened self-interest in a world that includes Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Lindsey Graham, Orrin Hatch
948580711249817601 2018-01-03 15:43:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jmartNYT @danpfeiffer Dan I dont understand the Mitt hate / snark on the left. He has stood up to Trump more than any other major R leader. And Utah aint electing a D. Maybe we should be more charitable / accepting of allies? There are so few Rs who matter who are willing to challenge this WH.
948568530596675584 2018-01-03 14:55:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson Also the part where he calls the three senior Trump campaign leaders treasonous.
948401758509780998 2018-01-02 03:52:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenjiBacker Eh, a lot of left people are psyched that hes running and agree hes a patriot. But I understand your follower base prefers your narrative.
948401226307158016 2018-01-02 03:50:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Whatever it takes to get him elected.
948397498971729920 2018-01-02 03:35:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AG_Conservative @AndyFezzik You have 100 followers.
948396675327934464 2018-01-02 03:32:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AG_Conservative So instead of criticizing Trump for his despicable behavior, you criticize Neera. I assime this reflects a decision to cater to your Twitter followers.
948393650249129984 2018-01-02 03:20:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ethank @JoshConstine I just dont believe the amount involved at the end of the day will be nearly that high
948392728747950081 2018-01-02 03:17:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @neeratanden Amy Chozick?
948366020326010882 2018-01-02 01:30:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Nothing Trump does should be praised as good. He is pure 100% evil. We cant have occasional daily amnesia because its uncomfortable to recognize the fascism for what it is. Exhibit #N below.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/948359545767841792
948360421819408385 2018-01-02 01:08:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ethank @JoshConstine These publishing rights fights never amount to much / anything super consequential.
948279949449990145 2018-01-02 19:48:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz The guy is a true patriot.
948278944280862721 2018-01-02 19:44:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz Hmm. I cant imagine what Romney will try to do with a seat in the US Senate. What accomplishment could he be part of that would secure a section of future history books?
948227538102480897 2018-01-02 16:20:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @peterbakernyt Any other well-run business would fire the people responsible for this massive operational breakdown.
948227274242916352 2018-01-02 16:19:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @peterbakernyt If you want to understand your readers anger, start by focusing on the Times silence about its terrible 2016 election coverage of Trump/Russia & Hillary email coverage. We are going to keep bringing this up. Arguably the worst/most consequential bad journalism in my lifetime.
947968869393682432 2018-01-01 23:12:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion The average follower count of the Twitter socialist you are arguing with today is ~300. Let me know when you start fighting with pro-cannibalism folks.
947940594957078535 2018-01-01 21:20:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Its a disgrace that this was published by The New York Times  a once great journalistic institution. @peterbakernyt is a terrible, sycophantic reporter, but the real blame is with leadership - @deanbaquet and @AGSNYT.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/947522761353601024
947832785900900353 2018-01-01 14:12:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RepCohen @ReaganBattalion 1st, this criticism is 100% accurate. 2nd, its not remotely an attack on Barron. 3rd, if Obama engaged in this narcissistic/anti-family-values/anti-church lifestyle, Rs would be bloodcurdling in their attacks - much worse. 4th, its an important/valid critique of DTs character.
947477340870860800 2017-12-31 14:39:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> Cant give a platform to man who is a fascist making no attempts to cover up his beliefs - right, this is the great mistake among Republican candidates: to not conceal their true beliefshttps://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/947472785923768320
947210153761361921 2017-12-30 20:57:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PatrickRuffini Another problem with cult-of-personality politics is that it can let a lying racist fascist slip through. Seems like thats the bigger concern now rather than handwringing about Bernie.
946950975868358656 2017-12-29 03:48:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytmike @peterbakernyt How about responding to the criticisms that arent personal attacks and therefore arent as easily dismissed? Like, why does it make sense to have zero follow-up questions and leave all his lies (all of them) unchallenged?
946948100500934656 2017-12-29 03:36:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @POTUS @nytimes @nytmike @katiepack Or maybe conservatives use #BothSides as a debating tactic. There is no chance that @peterbakernyt was biased left in that softball interview.
946923504196292608 2017-12-29 01:58:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AriFleischer @buckhornranch Ari how did you feel about all the lies, plus the assertion that he controls the Department of Justice?
946905137955725312 2017-12-29 00:45:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> The thing about NYTimes reporters being so defensive and rationalizing their Trump normalization... is that the Washington Post manages to do great work (maybe the best journalism overall since Watergate) *without* selling their soul to Trump.   So it can be done.
946866758098530305 2017-12-29 22:13:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom @DavidAFrench I mean, this guy is a threat to our entire system of government and our freedoms. Shouldnt preserving our democratic republic and constitutional liberties be the most important priority? I really dont understand how a thinking patriot could make any other choice.
946865205992198147 2017-12-29 22:07:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @politico Why do you run tweets like this that just encapsulate his lie, instead of making it clear that hes full of shit?
946863805497315328 2017-12-29 22:01:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom @DavidAFrench Why doesnt Trumps fascism, racism, and lying present an even greater problem?
946847531492937730 2017-12-29 20:56:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EsotericCD Thanks Jeff  awesome tweets

946818037965119489 2017-12-29 18:59:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KFILE What do you think of this:https://www.quora.com/Who-funds-The-Federalist/answer/J-Coyne
946594158080331776 2017-12-28 04:10:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytmike @maggieNYT OK fair enough and appreciate the response. In general I think its more useful to respond to the more measured / thoughtful criticism rather than to the the raw firehose of dumbo carping. And I agree that tonight, as always, much of the dumber criticism was simplistic.
946592076443111424 2017-12-28 04:01:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytmike @maggieNYT This is a totally reasonable response which engages with the criticism rather than invalidating or ridiculing it.
946589745055961095 2017-12-28 03:52:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytmike @maggieNYT That is an exaggerated, simplified characterization of the criticism which makes it easy for you to discount it. You and your colleagues seem immune to feedback.
946487329757302786 2017-12-28 21:05:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel Whats ignorant about this? My impression is that this *does* accurately describe the reactions of many hard-core pro-Israel folks.
946478429188259841 2017-12-28 20:30:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Good luck parsing the boundaries of how Trumps racism has inflamed hatred in America.

946140005998710791 2017-12-27 22:05:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SteveDeaceShow @ReaganBattalion Taking a wait and see approach after the Washington Post story broke was not reasonable. It was his right to take this position, but its everyone elses right to consider him a Moore apologist / normalizer.
946134756680486915 2017-12-27 21:44:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Breitbart is the problem, along with its supporters (Mercers)  not smalltime provocateurs like Nehlen. Its cheap & easy for conservatives to distance themselves from Nehlen. But what they should really be doing is calling out Breitbart for nonstop lying, racism, & hate-baiting.https://twitter.com/marcbodnick/status/946133371687710730

946133371687710730 2017-12-27 21:39:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel Hes a Breitbart ally and embodies Breitbarts values. The courageous thing is to attack Breitbart, not marginal nuts like Nehlen.
946114128506183680 2017-12-27 20:22:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> This. Dean Baquet should be fired.https://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/946104730039738368

946066775912992768 2017-12-27 17:14:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo The Black Panther series by Ta-Nehisi Coates and the March series by John Lewis are mainstream-ish canonical examples.

945782868235751426 2017-12-26 22:26:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TIME @senorrinhatch @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio @BenSasse @ReaganBattalion @TriciaHerrick1 @RobertStillwell OK lets see if Ben Sasse challenges Trump directly about his attacks on the FBI.
945767934651195392 2017-12-26 21:27:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @senorrinhatch @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio @BenSasse @ReaganBattalion Zero chance. Everyone on that list is in the bag for Trump. Lack of spine, lack of principles, too focused on their careers, maybe Trump/Russians has dirt on them - you pick the reason; its hard to explain the behavior.
945688481715679234 2017-12-26 16:11:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson Yeah right, Muslims get it so good these days.
945462269890170882 2017-12-25 01:12:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Yeah this is a totally inaccurate description of how Trump is promoting white nationalism.

945105396359974912 2017-12-24 01:34:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RedState I thought the real dogwhistle was Trumps racism - like when he called the Charlottesville Nazis real fine people. Or when he called the NFL players sons of bitches. Or saying that Obama was born in Kenya.
945066119777353728 2017-12-24 22:58:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hmichaellee My main takeaway from @molrattys tweet is that she is trying to assert rough equivalence for how dependent Obama and Trump were/are on TV news as a source of their information.
945064913562734594 2017-12-24 22:53:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @molratty @hmichaellee #BothSides! Obama and Trump *both* got some information from watching cable news.
945064193300008960 2017-12-24 22:50:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @molratty @hmichaellee Also I thought the IRS targeting thing was debunked, but Fox News still talks about it - so maybe its still fair game?
945063642843828224 2017-12-24 22:48:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @molratty @hmichaellee Am I distracting from a discussion of our ex-Presidents mistakes by citing a mistake thats too old? Its hard for me to participate in discussions about Hillarys / Obamas flaws because the norms are so confusing! Can I bring up Uranium One or is that off the table?
945059853113921537 2017-12-24 22:33:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @molratty @hmichaellee Im trying to come up with a complete list of the evil and lies Obama committed.
945056054672613376 2017-12-24 22:18:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @molratty Also Obama said that if you wanted to keep your doctor you could!

944639132105547776 2017-12-23 18:41:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Tom is one of the most important people to follow on Twitter, along with @BillKristolhttps://twitter.com/radiofreetom/status/944638320457453573
944626018626580480 2017-12-23 17:49:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RichLowry @gahorsman @NixTaylor Other evidence Trump is a racist: - investigated for not renting to African-Americans - denied the innocence of the Central Park 5 - spent years denying Obama was a US citizen - calls NFL players sons of bitches
944623975258251264 2017-12-23 17:41:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RichLowry @gahorsman @NixTaylor https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/politics/trump-immigration.html
944617491451469825 2017-12-23 17:15:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom Trump has impulses not a philosophy is putting lipstick on the pig. A more reasonable intepretation of 2017: Trump aspires to be a dictator, is v competent at attaining power, & uses lying & hatred effectively to undermine democratic institutions that try to constrain him.
944616547560996864 2017-12-23 17:11:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RichLowry @gahorsman You dont think Trump is a racist? Today he was quoted saying, in the Oval Office, that new arrivals from Haiti "all have AIDS" and that Nigerians would never go back to their huts" once they'd seen America.
944611862041190400 2017-12-23 16:53:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Obama didnt want to be a dictator. I know its unpopular to make this point to conservatives.
944610177243688960 2017-12-23 16:46:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> The trust you feel in our institutions is being undermined, not supported, by Republican Congressppl and leadership.
944609818332954624 2017-12-23 16:45:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> I have low confidence in Congress to protect us so long as it is R-controlled. Recent Trump obsequiousness is disturbing - eg Graham bootlicking. And R House-Fox News axis aimed at undermining Mueller feels Orwellian. If Trump fired SC, I distrust Congress to do right thing.
944606910145110016 2017-12-23 16:33:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Learjetjockey Charlottesville (very fine people), endorsing Roy Moore (who said Muslims shouldnt be able to serve in Congress), looking the other way while his alt-right supporters espouse racism, endorsing confederate statues - this is racism.
944606362436169729 2017-12-23 16:31:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> Right yes, good framing. People like me see him as a national emergency.
944606078171361281 2017-12-23 16:30:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> The arg people like me make is: our countrys #1 priority should be evicting this corrupt authoritarian from office. Now that tax reform is done, Id hope more principled Rs would join in focusing on that. But from what I can tell, more Rs are embracing Trump now vs 3-6 mos ago.
944603718913220608 2017-12-23 16:20:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RichLowry But the nonstop lying and racism, and undermining rule of law and institutions - thats not ordinary for Republicans I think.
944599063084724224 2017-12-23 16:02:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maura - Jeff Bezos & the Washington Post team - @benthompson and @stratechery - Stephen Colbert
944592706826780673 2017-12-23 15:37:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois I suspect this is the right interpretation. Its unimaginable that Trump actually wants to take steps hostile to Putins interests.pic.twitter.com/ImqJl5i0S2
944584996655738880 2017-12-23 15:06:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattklewis What about the nonstop lying, racism, and attempts to undermine rule of law?
944407707808776195 2017-12-22 03:21:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion What do you make of this?https://www.thedailybeast.com/atandt-credits-trump-for-bonus-its-union-already-negotiated
944374542083899392 2017-12-22 01:10:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ParkerMolloy Eh nobody really cares about it literally from what I can tell. Its code for we resent other cultures, races, religions and their rising % in American life. Also its a convenient way to take a slight dig at Jews for some folks.
944334797601509376 2017-12-22 22:32:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro Trump doesnt care about proper, which implies caring about whats in the countrys best interests. The man has no principles > he only cares about maximizing power and wealth.
944222618583838721 2017-12-22 15:06:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TimothyNoah1 @mattyglesias If I were a woman who had the courage to report, I would not view suspension and reassignment as a reasonable outcome.
944000953681829888 2017-12-21 00:25:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Patrick_Wyman @Noahpinion Yeah, your post is good, but to Patricks pt, it ignores realities of GOP preferences & tactics, & it ignores that Trump will do anything to retain power. Idea that Dems should focus on cooperation - I think thats a mistake. Resistance=optimal strategy until we switch presidents
943953416526577664 2017-12-21 21:16:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Pinterest @amir @jesshstark Thanks!
943932869310685184 2017-12-21 19:55:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattklewis @thor_benson OMG this post is horrible. Matt - you think the problem is that Trump is embarrassing and cringeworthy?
943931418916274176 2017-12-21 19:49:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattklewis @thor_benson Also the nonstop lying and racism
943881003096932352 2017-12-21 16:29:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kasie This tweet is a disgrace. #BothSides gimme a break.

943698547169411072 2017-12-20 04:24:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mckaycoppins He should; its clearly in the nations best interest, and Romney is a patriot.
943687396649984001 2017-12-20 03:39:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mckaycoppins To clarify, do you think Romney might primary Hatch?
943653366281863168 2017-12-20 01:24:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson @SykesCharlie @charlescwcooke @toxchick42 @HotlineJosh @RadioFreeTom Normalizers like Josh want to ignore the uncomfortable realities of Trumps authoritarian extremes because they undermine the its all in the game! narrative.
943652477034946561 2017-12-20 01:20:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson @SykesCharlie @charlescwcooke @toxchick42 @HotlineJosh @RadioFreeTom Josh underestimates risk that Trump takes extraordinary steps to retain power  starts a war, fires Mueller, etc. Trump will do what he can to retain power, using access to massive resources, incl control of Fox News. I dont get why lying & firing of Comey doesnt worry you more
943651096605573120 2017-12-20 01:15:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/7/21/16008190/strikethrough-white-supremacists-love-tucker-carlson
943649664762445825 2017-12-20 01:09:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenSasse @Earnest_T_Bass Clearly the threat that Trump fires Mueller for no good reason is >> problem vs risk Mueller is considered beyond reproach. Besides, the protect-Mueller legislation on the table doesnt block him altogether from being fired; it just takes decision somewhat out of Trumps hands.
943646211088687104 2017-12-20 00:56:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenSasse Why don't you support legislation making sure Mueller can't be fired as special prosecutor?
943645863775047681 2017-12-20 00:54:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson @SykesCharlie @charlescwcooke @HotlineJosh @RadioFreeTom Half this thread feels Cillizza-esque.
943638782535856128 2017-12-20 00:26:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheStreaksApp @JessShambora whats the right way to help these folks get going?
943638612293251072 2017-12-20 00:25:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheStreaksApp OK awesome - stay tuned.
943631618413019136 2017-12-20 23:58:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson @SykesCharlie @HotlineJosh @RadioFreeTom Josh you dont seem particularly worked up about the prospect of Trump firing Mueller, conspiring with Russia, ignoring rule of law, general opportunistic move toward authoritarianism, risk to our overall system of government. Your emphasis is quite Trump-normalizing.
943628707440107520 2017-12-20 23:46:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Pinterest @amir If Im a subscriber, is there a trick to get auto-signed in when I click from Twitter?
943625944236826624 2017-12-20 23:35:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheStreaksApp if I post questions about Streaks on Quora, would someone at the company answer them?
943617669952978944 2017-12-20 23:02:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman We can all agree that wasnt the right standard for Mussolini right? Or Franco? It sounds like you dont embrace this point, but the counter to your tweet is that the overwhelming priority for our country is to get this guy out of office.
943616951573626880 2017-12-20 22:59:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol Also most of the companies offering these bonuses are counting on favorable regulatory treatment from the USFG/Trump.

943614454071115778 2017-12-20 22:49:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @LPDonovan Look for regulated companies / companies that depend on the government's favor to follow suit.
943612234378260480 2017-12-20 22:41:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @comcast @ReaganBattalion Plus Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile.

943536126546944001 2017-12-20 17:38:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @seanhannity Who cares? Why does this matter?
943519894586384385 2017-12-20 16:34:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AlexMarlow @oliverdarcy @brianstelter Oliver - did you ask him about his comment that rape is sex that a woman ends up regretting?

943337733271052288 2017-12-19 04:30:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NiemanLab @mathewi Usually its because the business is still in a growth stage, likely before meaningful profitability
943337028003028994 2017-12-19 04:27:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleyfeinberg Also does he know that the Duke Mens Lacrosse team did *not* commit rape? They were falsely accused.
943336744530800640 2017-12-19 04:26:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleyfeinberg Does he know that Obama said that if you want to keep your doctor you can keep your doctor?
943259122262142976 2017-12-19 23:17:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson @DouthatNYT @Tuff_Jon It was sometime after Moore said that Muslims shouldnt be eligible to serve in Congress.
943203501827506176 2017-12-19 19:36:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ross it is shameful that you praise Erick Erickson without calling out his enthusiastic support for and normalization of racist, misogynist, and pedophile Roy Moore.https://twitter.com/douthatnyt/status/943174220057661440

943200744173330432 2017-12-19 19:25:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattmfm Im sure history will remember him for this milestone.
943191444361068544 2017-12-19 18:48:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Trump had Mike Cernovich as a White House visitor and Bannon as a senior WH staffer. Modern alt-right conspiracy theory scaremongering is officially encouraged and wink-winked from the institutional Republican Party and WH. Its not fringe.
943178902058409984 2017-12-19 17:59:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel One of those morons is President of the United States.
943173822181552128 2017-12-19 17:38:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso @mtracey @ggreenwald @davidharsanyi TBC, its not that I dont like the President. Not like the president = how I felt about Carter, GWB. Re Trump, I view him as a fascist & fomenter of hate, racism, misogyny. + I think hes an agent of Russia. tldr: he has terrible intentions & doesnt care about natl interest
943172436299616256 2017-12-19 17:33:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson @Evan_McMullin @JayCaruso @mtracey @ggreenwald @davidharsanyi George Will left the Republican Party over Trump  thats how important and dire he thought Trump. He supported Hillary Clinton over Trump, because he felt Trumps despicableness outweighed all other considerations.
943170639409569792 2017-12-19 17:26:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jameyer40 @davidharsanyi Fascism may be the wrong word but authoritarian doesnt necessarily include Trumps hate/racism-baiting and nonstop lying.
943170372328763392 2017-12-19 17:25:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso @mtracey @ggreenwald @davidharsanyi Im arguing that you should consider preservation of our system of govt over your policy priorities (all of them), because Trump is a major threat to that system. Obviously Im not alone in feeling this way - George Will, @Evan_McMullin, @TheRickWilson.
943169535669968897 2017-12-19 17:21:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi Also did you know that Obama said that you could keep your doctor under Obamacare? That was a lie!
943169186536112129 2017-12-19 17:20:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi I collect being called an idiot on Twitter. So far Ive got @ggreenwald @mtracey @JayCaruso plus a few others. Whats problematic here is that you are calling me maybe-idiotic-but-probably-a-liar, which doesnt fit into an easy slot, but still - Im going to count it.
943167934263836672 2017-12-19 17:15:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> No conservative can both 1/fiercely oppose Trump + 2/focus on policy priorities. Trump forces a choice; if you want policy, you have to embrace or at least normalize the fascism. He corrupts -> Ryan, Graham, etc. Making getting-rid-of-Trump #1 priority=hard, admirable tradeoff.https://twitter.com/davidharsanyi/status/943166050232881152
943165505212313600 2017-12-19 17:05:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi I dont understand smart, experienced political analysts who assess Trump and dont see fascism  with his lying, disinformation, racism, hatred. Its shocking. I have huge respect for conservative writers who have the guts to call this out and stand against peers and readers.
943164126527754240 2017-12-19 17:00:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi Maybe real conservatives believe Trump is a fascist and getting rid of him is more important than any policy.
943004232415772675 2017-12-18 06:25:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso The bigger problem is Fox News.
942974363581562881 2017-12-18 04:26:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @TomFitton You seem completely biased; there is literally zero signal from a tweet like this. You would improve your position by supporting your view with legal arguments.
942968016853024768 2017-12-18 04:01:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katherinemiller Hearing peoples opinions about it is better than watching it.
942920884230094848 2017-12-18 00:53:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Yeah she seems super-credible / authentic / charismatic. Shes the one administration official that everyone in my family likes.
942900460272287745 2017-12-18 23:32:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel Agree. It wouldn't make sense for Putin to handle Trump like a normal asset, like on The Americans. Trump is a US president - you can't do clandestine meetings in coffee shops or laundromats. I hope Clapper wasn't implying that. Russia has to manipulate Trump in a customized way.
942862396728602624 2017-12-18 21:01:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SeanTrende If Im putting two and two together, it sounds like many law enforcement folks think Trump and his team are corrupt and have engaged in criminal behavior.
942854435906056192 2017-12-18 20:29:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NRO @JayCostTWS @riotwomennn Yeah Jay I dont understand why you think its possible for Trump to make this change.
942849158603358208 2017-12-18 20:08:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> UberEATS would be a lot better if there was a good @sweetgreen integration. Right now in Palo Alto, its not available at all. @jdroege - whats the status?

942841333357481984 2017-12-18 19:37:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion @AngelaLMorabito Hmm - disturbing but not surprising. What do we know so far?

942815161689055232 2017-12-18 17:53:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @biz @jack .@Jack @Biz I dont understand why you dont ban Trump. He has clearly violated your rules multiple times. If you arent willing to enforce your rules consistently  including coverage of your most important user  these rules will never work.

942216421014040576 2017-12-16 02:14:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hughhewitt @peterdaou Hugh your network is engaging in a massive campaign of disinformation against Mueller. Own it.
942213463949971458 2017-12-16 02:02:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Z_Patos @WalshFreedom You wish? Hes an authoritarian who will do whatever he can to hold onto power. If your wish is results-oriented, oppose Trump altogether.
942212872007852033 2017-12-16 02:00:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Oh man. Boo. Is someone from The Federalist guest hosting?

941799776747585536 2017-12-15 22:38:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ezraklein This is somewhat analogous to investment bankers who tip M&A processes to certain favored private equity sponsors in hopes of getting a job down the road.
941798947340795904 2017-12-15 22:35:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jteufert I see. Yeah I see theres merit to your characterization. But my basic point is that dwelling and focusing on the flaws of reporters given the current climate / context doesnt make sense.
941796185131515904 2017-12-15 22:24:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jesslivingston @jteufert Im not a reporter, so how is it ironic? Also I dont understand why you think I misleadingly rephrased.
941785058678935552 2017-12-15 21:40:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jesslivingston How distracting and dishonest reporters are  you mean in general? Seems to me reporters as a group have never been more courageous and focused on telling the truth. Obviously there are exceptions.
941778044041043973 2017-12-15 21:12:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion @RealJacobPerry Oh is that what he did this week?

941771564193681408 2017-12-15 20:46:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> OH: Trump has neurosyphilis is the Obama was born in Kenya of 2017.
941720734883241984 2017-12-15 17:24:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Acosta This completely contradicts his client.
941720221110362112 2017-12-15 17:22:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold Another explanation in a similar vein is that conservatives have good taste and are plugged into whats culturally relevant and interesting.
941706602196766720 2017-12-15 16:28:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marklevinshow @ReaganBattalion Im worried that some conservative pundits arent authentic or straightshooting.
941703645434757126 2017-12-15 16:16:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonallendc @brianefallon It is astonishing what a fucking bozo Trump nominated for a federal judgeship. That represents a crisis for US government. Jonathan I hope you focus on this as opposed to the tactical question of how this guy prepared for his hearing. Focusing on the latter is Cillizza-like.
941702267618574336 2017-12-15 16:11:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianefallon @jonallendc True, but your underprepared-for-the-hearing point pales in importance to Brians zero-qualifications-for-the-job point. Brians point is catastrophically, gravely important.
941701574778220544 2017-12-15 16:08:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonallendc @brianefallon https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/941517727876943872
941701434835222528 2017-12-15 16:08:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonallendc @brianefallon This is 100% correct. Jonathan you should be focused on the fact that Trump wanted to appoint someone completely unprepared / unqualified to take this job.
941699512766160897 2017-12-15 16:00:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SohrabAhmari That is definitely not the tragedy of this White House
941552996365692928 2017-12-14 06:18:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Sorry, my view on Ryan is not that hes the biggest fake but that hes the #1 Trump enabler.
941552094619693057 2017-12-14 06:14:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @blackthought @tristanwalker Yeah this is crazy
941503077634289664 2017-12-14 03:00:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion These days I dont like many Republicans other than a few folks, including you. I think this is rational, not intolerant.
941457683537784833 2017-12-14 23:59:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel Uh, this means a new President.
941452772133675009 2017-12-14 23:40:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sama @JMGrange @BenedictEvans @anildash I hear ya. Anyway, I really liked this thread - thanks for writing it.
941451740729163776 2017-12-14 23:36:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sama @JMGrange @BenedictEvans @anildash I agree the question was mean & condescending but I dont think he was implicitly accusing you of never having served in your community or engaging honestly in helping people in your neighborhood. I think hes accusing you of not dealing w people who disagree with you reasonably.
941450815704670208 2017-12-14 23:32:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JMGrange Fwiw: - I strongly agree with @anildashs critique of @sama - I think Anil misinterpreted @BenedictEvans tweet
941443760507953152 2017-12-14 23:04:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ComfortablySmug You mean because they think Trump is a compromised Russian agent?
941392380179095552 2017-12-14 19:40:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @Johannsalc Right Johann, this is how I feel
941385452279304192 2017-12-14 19:12:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @Shill_Bot I see you live in South Dakota. Do you care about how Net Neutrality will affect internet access in your state?
941384908114505728 2017-12-14 19:10:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro But what you focus on in your tweet is the left losing its mind. Is that because that theme will maximize engagement among your followers? Why didnt you emphasize the merits of Net Neutrality in your tweet?
941384346866352128 2017-12-14 19:08:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro You just like when liberals and Democrats are mad, right? You dont seem to care about whats good for the country. I dont understand why you dont support Net Neutrality or why you are making light of opposition to getting rid of it.
941379194549714944 2017-12-14 18:47:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Seems like a pretty negative guy
941356479923109888 2017-12-14 17:17:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel Yeah, the NYT engages in systematic campaigns of lying/disinformation like #Pizzagate, #SethRich, #UraniumOne. And NYT has powerful people on staff who engage in same kind of hateful dishonest propaganda as Hannity & @JudgeJeanine. #BothSides are bad; who can tell the difference.
941187973063745536 2017-12-13 06:07:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Why is this point important? Who cares? Dont you care about the concerns of women? Who cares if some men are made uncomfortable?
941184894314545152 2017-12-13 05:55:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FoxNews @ReaganBattalion See @BecketAdams this is an appropriate level of gravity. But you do you.
941171999543476224 2017-12-13 05:04:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BecketAdams I guess you dont see the Fox News disinformation campaign against Mueller the same way I do.

941170967987896320 2017-12-13 05:00:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BecketAdams oh come on  how is that a proportionate response
941120333007937536 2017-12-13 01:39:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KPhed OK. Can you keep me updated from time to time? Sad that Ive lost this insight channel.

941113576848162816 2017-12-13 01:12:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JudgeJeanine @EsotericCD @VCSteel1 Yeah. My point is that the problem is not limited to the lunatic fringe; its at the core  including Trump himself and @PressSec
941111643181694976 2017-12-13 01:04:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EsotericCD @maxrogo Republicans broadly have created a toxic environment of ignorance, hatred, and conspiracy theory bs that supports this kind of speculation.
941109181897089024 2017-12-13 00:54:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Voters also would have been fine with Moores vicious homophobia.
941107206656737280 2017-12-13 00:46:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EsotericCD Also: Sean Hannity, @JudgeJeanine, Alan Dershowitz. Pretty much 3/4 of Fox News on an audience-weighted basis. The right is dominated by disinformation and lying.
941101421168025600 2017-12-13 00:23:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katiepack @MikeDuHaime I dont understand this tweet
941081639664328705 2017-12-13 23:05:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench This is optimistic. Trump & Fox News are doing their best to whip up hatred & racism & keep Southern electoral outcomes the same as always. Moore lost bc he was pedophile, not bc he thinks Muslims shouldnt be allowed to serve in Congress. Voters would have been fine with that.

941065681881128960 2017-12-13 22:01:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman Interesting post, but it underplays role played by Trump, Hannity, and other R ldrs in actively making R voters more ignorant/hateful. R voters didn't independently conclude Obama wasn't US-born; they were led to it by Trump & Fox News. Ditto #SethRich, #Pizzagate, Uranium One.

941019243113361408 2017-12-13 18:57:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Im not robbing him of agency / responsibility. But whats the point of blaming the disgraced pedophile? Key analytic question is how did he reach this point, which was so politically disadvantageous to the dominant party?
941018441217056768 2017-12-13 18:54:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Holding Moore responsible is like blaming a rabid dog who bites. Sure, bad dog. Trump is the party head - buck stops with him.
941013122550136833 2017-12-13 18:33:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac @fmanjoo Cmon Mike.
941010010443628545 2017-12-13 18:20:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion @conservmillen Trump attacks women for their appearance like no politician has in modern history. And your party ignores them. If you can cite Dem parallels, fire away. Its a challenging time to have children when the President incites so much hate toward women. But sure, fire up #BothSides.
941007378404610048 2017-12-13 18:10:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion @conservmillen But making fun of their appearance is *integral* to the misogynistic attacks that many in your party (including & esp your leader) purposefully engage in. Its not a tactical error; its not rude; its done because many Republican voters find it appealing.
940996885778653185 2017-12-13 17:28:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman Hes a Democrat in Alabama. Nobody is going to be disappointed either way. Hes also not-a-fascist which is super-exciting.
940981719280205824 2017-12-13 16:28:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RepKinzinger Trump is the real problem here, not Bannon. But it takes courage to acknowledge that.

940670117322432512 2017-12-12 19:50:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stuartpstevens @SethAMandel Why is poking fun at her the thing you are focused on / interested in today?
940651665035640832 2017-12-12 18:36:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BlueBoxDave Hes a misogynist who stokes misogyny. Playful is woefully inadequate as a descriptive word. Maybe troll captures the point you are making while still accurately damning him for his intent.

940376880049405953 2017-12-11 00:24:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AriFleischer Foxs tweet has 300 RTs. This one here that you posted has 18. You can try to have 2 different messages, one customized for reasonable people and one for Fox viewers. But we can all read and see whats going on.
940260102447046656 2017-12-11 16:40:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Gws130 @davidharsanyi The impact of Shep Smith and Chris Wallace is swamped by the toxic dishonesty of Hannity, Fox and Friends and @JudgeJeanine.
940259644915703809 2017-12-11 16:39:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Gws130 @davidharsanyi Compared to Fox News?
940259204685643776 2017-12-11 16:37:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi Hannity and Breitbart viewers see those outlets as delivering news. Seth Rich was news. The Roy Moore accuser forging the yearbook signature (as Breitbart claimed) was news.
940258512759767040 2017-12-11 16:34:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi Dozens? How can you write stuff like this when Fox News and Breitbart peddle lies on a daily basis - Big and small. #SethRich #Pizzagate etc. I dont know you well - do you have a track record of attacking Hannity and Alex Jones (both of whom Trump lavishes praise on)?
940258047368105984 2017-12-11 16:32:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi He calls the NYT and Washington Post fake news & seeks to undermine viewer credibility in them. They are obviously not fake news. And with his attacks on so many outlets other than Fox News, he is clearly signaling that he believes Fox News is the only legitimate news source.
940257105503707136 2017-12-11 16:28:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi They only have themselves to blame - you cant be serious. Trump attacks the credibility of our free press on a daily basis.
939995772216524800 2017-12-10 23:10:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @renato_mariotti Its incredible that Twitter verified this guy. Hes 20 years old and passing himself off as an investment fund CEO.
939975469998383104 2017-12-10 21:49:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @renato_mariotti Who is this guy?
939975281070129152 2017-12-10 21:49:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin Its not fringe on Fox News, and Trump himself emphasizes it.
939973936627859456 2017-12-10 21:43:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaketapper @ReaganBattalion In general I agree with you but the GOP obsession with Merry Christmas is off-putting and makes people of other faiths feel like they are less important / less American.

939178933748097024 2017-12-08 17:04:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold Oh thats very cool. But my point is that with Fox its not about debunking or irresponsible. Those words imply a baseline of accuracy and good intentions.
939176756505747457 2017-12-08 16:56:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold Did you think #SethRich was insanely irresponsible?
939176535218569216 2017-12-08 16:55:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold Whats your point? This is what Fox News does - spread disinformation.
939173003211939840 2017-12-08 16:41:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricBoehlert Trump base voters have a lot of concern about all those events.
939169751846105088 2017-12-08 16:28:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ddale8 Graham wants to avoid a Trumpist primary challenger. That theory explains most of his behavior.

938792037393997825 2017-12-07 15:27:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows Why do you think the Times has been so avoidant re addressing this issue publicly?
938643765589192704 2017-12-06 05:38:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @harper @anniekarni How can you write an article like this and not mention the role of Trump's pro-Israel donors like the Adelsons?

938489460987019264 2017-12-06 19:24:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MittRomney @senorrinhatch Helping him understand more about the LDS Church isnt the problem here. You should condemn Bannon, period  not just for his attacks on Romney and the LDS faith, but also for his role in whipping up hatred against Muslims, Jews, African-Americans, and women.
938476143115505664 2017-12-06 18:32:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sam_baker Amazing this exchange doesnt mention Trump.
938472163325108224 2017-12-06 18:16:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> 3 things can be true at once -> Rs can 1. Elect least ethical, most misogynist & racist president ever 2. Claim they are appalled by behaviors of Trump & Moore 3. Not do anything real to oppose these guys (ie support D opponents) and therefore enjoy pol benefits of their winshttps://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/938469931581980672
938456365420314624 2017-12-06 17:13:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @miles_snider @CBSolic @AltUSPressSec Being on the right side means calling for impeachment (re Trump) and in support of Jones (re Moore).
938447168423071744 2017-12-06 16:36:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaketapper Its disingenuous to say #stayout to Bannon but not Trump. Bannon is Trumps agent and doing Trumps bidding - they have a bad cop strategy that Republicans want to ignore.
938443633782538240 2017-12-06 16:22:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion What about Hatch? News was that he was in political discussions with Bannon.
938440760826871810 2017-12-06 16:11:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @christinawilkie help him understand - that implies that Bannon isnt a bigot
938254999678730240 2017-12-05 03:53:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SpeakerRyan @cimarcos Thats awesome. That almost makes up for his strong support of Trumps fascism and lies.
938245822054932481 2017-12-05 03:16:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jackfowler Thats hilarious. The Russian judge gives the lower score because he likes Trump - is that the joke?
938224171598753792 2017-12-05 01:50:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rgoodlaw If we relax the default view that the VP and his staff generally tell the truth, and instead assume that they are liars like the rest of the Trump WH, it becomes less important to figure out whats going on / scratch our heads in confusion when they tell lies.
938223315172208640 2017-12-05 01:47:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @matthewjdowd pure fascist gaslighting
938203655940988929 2017-12-05 00:29:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenSasse So, esp given that Alabama is heavily Republican, you are favoring Moore with this "I wouldn't vote for either of them" declaration. You will be considered partially accountable for Moore's election since you are a leader of the Republican Party and your party is backing Moore.
938201728159117312 2017-12-05 00:21:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenSasse You are avoiding reality & the actual tradeoff. 1 of these 2 will be elected, & if you think Moore is worse than Jones, its best to maximize Joness prospects. Doing nothing (as you are) is helping Moore by giving the impression GOP leaders tolerate Moores pedophilia & racism.
938191153567907840 2017-12-05 23:39:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stephenfhayes But not one of them have made any public statements or taken some kind of action. Telling your friends that you feel uncomfortable could be authentic, or it could simply be socially and politically prudent.

938118509703315456 2017-12-05 18:50:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JeremyKonyndyk Trump doesnt care about a peace deal. He wants Adelson money.

937930559438725120 2017-12-04 06:24:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tribelaw Professor Tribe, what do you think has happened to Alan Dershowitz. I used to really admire him but now he seems like a simple flack for Trump. Do you think someone is paying him to say stuff like this?
937831814273449984 2017-12-04 23:51:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jamesgoldston @brianstelter @felixsalmon @MikeIsaac But there shouldnt be so little room. We shouldnt concede the double standard where ABC and CNN are held to one standard while Fox News, Trump, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders are held to another. Its total bullshit.
937831405651869696 2017-12-04 23:50:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jamesgoldston @brianstelter @felixsalmon Yes, this. This is 100% on point. The double standard where we beat up CNN and ABC for mistakes but let Fox News engage in nonstop Orwellian Big Lies (eg #SethRich, #PizzaGate, #UraniumOne) is disgusting.
937824633146896384 2017-12-04 23:23:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytimes @corvineblanco @jayrosen_nyu Wow I hadnt read this before. This is an extraordinarily insightful analysis. Dean Baquet is simply an atrocious leader  what a loss for us all during such an important time, but what a gift that Marty Baron runs the Post.
937821093892538368 2017-12-04 23:09:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dandrezner Is this perjury?
937820059761754112 2017-12-04 23:05:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> The anger toward ABC re @BrianRoss is just ridiculous, in a world where @seanhannity (and @PressSec) spread their lies on a daily basis.https://twitter.com/marcbodnick/status/937819408252026880
937819631506436096 2017-12-04 23:03:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu How this compare to Hannitys correction re Seth Rich?
937819408252026880 2017-12-04 23:02:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BrianRoss @abcnews @Peter_Wehner Ok it was a big mistake. But the coverage here seems extraordinarily skewed given that Fox News *purposefully* tells multiple lies big & small every day. How do we think about #Pizzagate, #SethRich, Uranium One? Fox News should be shuttered given the standards we hold ABC, CNN to
937817806225031169 2017-12-04 22:56:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @steph_bello Yeah its incredible how much shit ABC has taken for this.
937805670912475138 2017-12-04 22:07:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MEPFuller Why do you think he thinks that? I think its more like (since hes smart) he knows otherwise and is taking a courageous position.

937803004534591488 2017-12-04 21:57:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ezlusztig Oh cmon thats not fair. Romney was considering serving as Secretary of State, motivated by a desire to serve his country. Romney clearly thinks Trump is despicable and was among the most publicly aggressive Republican political leaders attacking Trump during the primaries.

937755714574958592 2017-12-04 18:49:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fawfulfan When I think racist motive here, it feels more along the lines of liking Moore because of his racism vs disliking Jones.
937753888312061952 2017-12-04 18:42:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fawfulfan I would assume that concealed racism is a major factor that polling wont pick up

937361584397193218 2017-12-03 16:43:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @CarolLeonnig Im comfortable with where I ended up here. Your tweet was too declarative and not skeptical enough. Consider the possibility that these guys are lying to you over half the time re controversial topics / topics that involve their self-interest.
937093685115842560 2017-12-02 22:58:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo Its impossible as a normal person using the internet. I doubt theater owners themselves know until Sunday / Monday when they can judge trailing box office.
937093086584410112 2017-12-02 22:56:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @CarolLeonnig Wrong - the presidents lawyer *says* he drafted the tweet. Maybe he actually did; who knows. When are journalists going to stop writing in a way that gives the honesty benefit-of-the-doubt to Trump and his team? They lie non-stop.
937069706162384896 2017-12-02 21:23:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RonaldKlain what?
937047258398420992 2017-12-02 19:54:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DougHeye @jayrosen_nyu I told Doug Elmendorf that I thought it was disgraceful that Harvard gave a fellow title to a guy who is such a fucking liar.
937038601619197952 2017-12-02 19:19:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytimes @dangillmor @PatcohenNYT whats your response to this? Seems like a thoughtful criticism.
937020643870208002 2017-12-02 18:08:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rkylesmith @DavidAFrench Seems fine to just treat the tweets and the Lester Holt interview as fact.
937017349168869377 2017-12-02 17:55:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NRO @rgoodlaw I guess people are reluctant to state the obvious, but McCarthy seems like he is often just a straight, intellectually dishonest partisan.

I hope that doesnt sound cynical.
936944480850194432 2017-12-02 13:05:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom @steph_bello Again and again Republicans are the beneficiaries of racist political strategies and messaging and good people dont do nearly enough to criticize that racism (eg birtherism, Willie Horton-style ads, etc).

936632268751118336 2017-12-01 16:25:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel What are you talking about? This clearly contradicts Trumps prior statement.
936628333076295680 2017-12-01 16:09:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold Oh cmon, of course Trump would do it if he could. And of course hes thinking about it.

936353725114806272 2017-11-30 21:58:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TeflonGeek @zvexler @nerfburglar @BlueBoxDave Believing that Jews should be all killed seems like speech that the government should protect but a business owner shouldnt be obligated to keep that person on the payroll. I dont see what law / rights are involved here.
936351155432468480 2017-11-30 21:48:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TeflonGeek @zvexler @nerfburglar @BlueBoxDave You realize this all this sounds like you are stretching to defend a Nazi? I mean who cares if a business owner fires someone because theyre a Nazi. Thats a more important issue than the Nazism? Its an odd focus to choose. Unless you think this guy isnt a Nazi? Im confused.
936349199062274054 2017-11-30 21:40:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JMBooyah I mean, realistically, what happened here is that Cruise is struggling to hire SV eng talent and this guy is struggling to get a job.

936314237349126145 2017-11-30 19:21:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TeflonGeek Why RIP free speech? No restrictions on free speech in this situation. He got a megaphone for his views.

936308113040273408 2017-11-30 18:57:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo @MikeIsaac yes yes, I get it. I was kidding. I have been the victim of a few of these pile-ons.
936306492436709376 2017-11-30 18:50:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac @fmanjoo but then you dont get as much distro. you really arent making sense.
936305466119819264 2017-11-30 18:46:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo @MikeIsaac what if someone says something dumb
936305285647306752 2017-11-30 18:45:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> Any controversial answer that comes out of the mouth of Trump and his White House / cabinet that isn't under oath --> we should presume it's a liehttps://twitter.com/mkraju/status/936297907548024835

936272543949787136 2017-11-30 16:35:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AriFleischer You cant be serious with this tweet. Do you have any personal integrity? Loyal to the president,  bad for the State Department? This is like being angry that people are disloyal to Mussolini.
936271551510413312 2017-11-30 16:31:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PhilippeReines Ive wondered why a nickname like Lying Trump or Pussy Grabber hasnt caught on. I guess no Dems have Trumps combination of shamelessness / online charisma to pull this off. No Dem has nearly Trumps Twitter mojo except the Obamas and HRC.

936103522604539904 2017-11-29 05:24:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @seungminkim @LauraLitvan especially when your partys voters are full of racists and misogynists!
936102702039277568 2017-11-29 05:20:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jimmyfallon @brianstelter @frankpallotta super weak - he probably cleared this with NBC brass. Typically cowardly, apolitical Jimmy Fallon.

936086871641165825 2017-11-29 04:17:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson Sure blame this behavior on abortion - totally makes sense. Whats confusing is that Trump harasses women but he has also purchased multiple abortions. Or maybe that supports your point. Im confused.

935946609631703041 2017-11-29 19:00:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KaraCalavera I dont necessarily agree. Trumps frantic Bill Clinton whataboutist push at the end (ie appearing with Clintons accusers) seemed to help get some swing voters back in his corner. They all do it does seem to let some people off their moral responsibility hook.

935903898367180800 2017-11-29 16:10:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @xan_desanctis @benshapiro Good one Ed. I assume you saw Trumps retweets of Britain First this morning. Those seem objectively racist to me. BTW Im more of a centrist than a liberal. Ive voted Republican many times.
935900123887837184 2017-11-29 15:55:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jemelehill @luvbeingjmo Do you understand the idea of #NotAllMen? Your own experience doesnt negate her point.

935887764762927104 2017-11-29 15:06:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump just RTd an anti-Muslim group. Does discipline mean hey keep those thoughts to yourself? I dont think being a racist is a discipline problem.https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/935883288618655744

Maggie is w/o question the #1 reporter covering this WH -> she's playing a massive, heroic role shining a light on Trump. She has to strike a v difficult balance to get the job done and it's fine/fair if we criticize when we think she's made a bad choice.
935712207802793984 2017-11-28 03:29:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT Maggie, you characterizing this behavior as sales is normalizing fascism.

935321182714306560 2017-11-27 01:35:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshgreenman @justinjm1 Personally I like these tweets - I enjoy the anticipation, especially if its from someone credible. And I dont begrudge the writer two bites at the apple; distribution is hard these days.
935304510330695680 2017-11-27 00:29:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ira Oh good point, but I meant to say that he's solid in them, or at least certainly in the first one. I really liked him in that role. I don't think I've ever seen Armie Hammer in a big-budget movie where I thought he was good.
935303774419034112 2017-11-27 00:26:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ira Wonder Woman and the Star Trek movies is a much better commercial movie track record than Armie Hammer's.
935282176861528064 2017-11-27 23:00:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JeffYoung Yeah right. But Im wondering if TDC is lying.
935281484893528064 2017-11-27 22:57:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ilmulinonewyork @MelissaAFrancis Maybe he feels so strongly about Fox News that he is willing to say what he really thinks, even if it costs him business.

934999355571847168 2017-11-26 04:16:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanaHoule This is 100% true. He is full-on Trump toady.
934941291258920960 2017-11-26 00:25:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hmichaellee IMO the biggest problem is the racism and hatred cultivated by Rs, including mainstream R campaigns, over the years. Its still going - Gillespies race-baiting was disgraceful.
934938038710370304 2017-11-26 00:12:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hmichaellee Thats revisionist / not what happened. And Republicans spent 3 years birtherisming Obama or looking the other way. This isnt #BothSides. Republican racist and hate-baiting tactics are flat-out evil in comparison to meming Romneys binders of women.
934904981542588416 2017-11-26 22:01:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MattMackowiak I dont understand. Obama was president for 8 years. Hasnt Trump already exceeded this # of covers since running for President?
934897489236451328 2017-11-26 21:31:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KattyKayBBC Also I think Trump is providing a rationalization path / breadcrumb trail for Alabama R voters who *want* to vote for Moore but feel bad about child molestation. Presumably its the Luther Strange primary voters who are wrestling hardest with this decision.
934892493161844743 2017-11-26 21:11:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KattyKayBBC Not complicated I think. Trumps goal is to communicate: 1. He wasnt for Moore originally 2. Hes most focused on getting R elected and defeating the D lib 3. Moore wasnt his first choice but hes much better than D lib
934889314336624641 2017-11-26 20:59:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel @KT_So_It_Goes All of this works best when there is maximum empathy for Moore supporters and we minimize awfulness of child predation culpability.
934889252424478720 2017-11-26 20:59:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel @KT_So_It_Goes Yeah agree. Goal of Moore supporter-sympathizers is to have it both ways  (1) be perceived as condemning child molestation but (2) still not cause too much trouble among fellow Rs and (2a) benefit from political advantage of Moore winning.
934885404200796161 2017-11-26 20:43:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KT_So_It_Goes @SethAMandel The purpose of Guys tweet was to make us feel empathy for Moore supporters.
934864395473178628 2017-11-26 19:20:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @cwarzel Hey look, journalism! Great work. Buzzfeeds investigative journalism rivals the Times these days.

934856505567956993 2017-11-26 18:48:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bentsmithfour @auren Should I be open-minded toward educated and affluent Trump supporters?

934817358635511808 2017-11-26 16:13:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SenatorBurr @martinmatishak A big part of this story is that Republicans have no incentive to address Russian electoral interference. Russians and Republicans are aligned in interest.

934541767264829446 2017-11-25 21:58:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonlovett Its nuts that the Times wont publicly respond to / engage with this criticism.
934452077732028417 2017-11-25 16:01:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tferriss @jesslivingston What topics do you think hes talking about? Lots of confusion about this.
934445875333607424 2017-11-25 15:37:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson @LizMair For example, Ben Sasse or Mitt Romney look available.
934266215647858688 2017-11-24 03:43:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SHSanders45 @AprilDRyan @terib3294 Teri I dont see how this is despicable.
934263656099008513 2017-11-24 03:33:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SHSanders45 @AprilDRyan @terib3294 Maybe Aprils point is that Sarah Huckabee Sanders lies all the time.
934251039796224000 2017-11-24 02:43:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson @LizMair Maybe your party could take some responsibility and pick a different nominee.
934243890047148032 2017-11-24 02:14:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray Itll take 4-5 episodes before you are convinced it was a good decision to commit.

933919260631535617 2017-11-23 04:44:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ViableBen @pt Yes, this. This tweet. The one that begins with Perhaps

933847642874040320 2017-11-23 00:00:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tferriss @mdudas I love the idea that strong, implacable hostility to Trump is considered McCarthyism.
933846997970366469 2017-11-23 23:57:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tferriss @mdudas People seem much more open-minded to Trump in Texas.

933455026353184769 2017-11-22 21:59:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry Also Richard Daley and the Kennedys stole the election from Nixon in 1960

933392965950521344 2017-11-22 17:53:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @eddiemaughon Oh cmon when Trump calls out @Lavarbigballer @Kaepernick7 @StephenCurry30 #marshawnlynch, its obviously racism-baiting.
933363874090254343 2017-11-22 15:57:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro Another possibility is that hes a racist demagogue who is good at stirring up racist sentiment among his supporters

932759358101786624 2017-11-20 23:55:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO If Mike Pence is willing to meet with men alone but not women, clearly that is bad professionally for the women who work with him.
932759143340949509 2017-11-20 23:54:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO I dont know who practices it, but I know whos been defending it  David French, Erick Erickson, Brit Hume (and Im guessing others @ Fox), etc. The Pence Rule should be condemned as a behavior that would result in women not having the same opportunities as men. Do you disagree?
932757475358523392 2017-11-20 23:48:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO As long as conservatives support thinking like the Pence Rule, they will be perceived as not supportive of women.

932653720906506240 2017-11-20 16:55:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @readDanwrite @YahooFinance wrong link
932633724667052037 2017-11-20 15:36:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCostTWS I mean, who are you talking to? Theres a giant industry of right-wing media led by Fox News that fully embraces false sources and liars in pursuit of their political agenda.
932632275602219009 2017-11-20 15:30:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jimgeraghty Almost no Democrats feel this way. You are pretty much making this up to make a clever #BothSides tweet.
932104888359596032 2017-11-18 04:34:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @buzz One thing Ive noticed - not really related to your point - is that for my less used Twitter accounts (eg @marcbodnick2) I often get a cluster of reactivation notifs (eg these 5 people you follow liked this tweet). This started maybe a year ago.
932103475806085120 2017-11-18 04:29:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @buzz To be clear I dont disagree
932103429064867840 2017-11-18 04:29:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @buzz Any evidence of this decline?
932013690961793024 2017-11-18 22:32:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry Sorry yep everyone doesnt agree w this pt - I overstated. But most reasonable people w/o an agenda think Obama wasnt corrupt. I know this is an adversarial pt to make to Rs who will obsess over a few things (Fast Furious, etc) but really cmon the history books will be clear
932007776280240128 2017-11-18 22:09:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry Yeah I know many Republicans reject this narrative. But most reasonable people think Obama was honest and not corrupt.
932002690921410560 2017-11-18 21:48:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry We all believe this.
931745012894777350 2017-11-17 04:44:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mikel_Jollett @baseballcrank oh cmon Dan. Obama was the cleanest president of our lifetime.

931629438529290240 2017-11-17 21:05:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chick_in_kiev Yeah maybe that first clause is using the command tense

931602097073659904 2017-11-17 19:17:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanaHoule Yeah I agree with thiss @Susan_Hennessey I dont see how the Russia collusion point doesnt open up the possibility that we would consider the election not legitimate
931565577033756672 2017-11-17 16:51:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @emilyorelse I like your Stranger Things reviews. How does it work when a new Netflix season is released? Do you try to write all the episode reviews asap, or do you stagger them?
931564565346729984 2017-11-17 16:47:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> Republicans who love the Pence Rule are showing their true colors > separate but equalhttps://twitter.com/thegarance/status/931552470018547712

931404107721478144 2017-11-16 06:10:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @senorrinhatch @UtahGOP @AEhasenberg I dont understand why you are tweeting this. Do you think Republicans are interested in bipartisan collaboration on major issues?
931402135727570945 2017-11-16 06:02:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chick_in_kiev cynical
931384371164020736 2017-11-16 04:51:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Thanks.
931383980611461122 2017-11-16 04:50:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DavidAFrench Does it get better as the episodes progress? First episode dull-ish.
931324445326635008 2017-11-16 00:53:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @nedprice No, I think the correct translation is: my base is passionately misogynistic and I dont want to do or say anything that might alienate them.
931315047682293760 2017-11-16 00:16:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mmfa Wrong. Its just that Hannitys viewers overlap with Moore supporters > the two groups basically see eye to eye and Hannity doesnt want to alienate them.
931296447856762880 2017-11-16 23:02:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson Seriously Id love to understand what a thoughtful, women-should-have-equal-opportunity defense of the Pence rule looks like.
931290906400997378 2017-11-16 22:40:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson Erick I dont understand how you fail to see that the Pence rule is unfair toward women and will hinder their careers. I dont want my daughters to have to live in a Pence rule world; I want them to work with men who dont harass them.
931225541654355968 2017-11-16 18:20:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> Im now confused why Roy Moore isnt verified. https://twitter.com/mooresenate/status/931222390821941248
931212090387210240 2017-11-16 17:27:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro It is amazing that you go to robots before mentioning women. Is it because you actually feel this way or because your followers do?pic.twitter.com/OXFHMJzhIq
931210265034506240 2017-11-16 17:20:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel Very high integrity that you posted this.
931209205880471552 2017-11-16 17:15:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alfranken @benshapiro @RVAwonk @JoeBauers2505 I think we (on the left) can show enough integrity to not link the Franken and Moore cases. Lets just condemn Franken.
931207200348839936 2017-11-16 17:07:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro This is your reaction? How about women, or men who dont sexually harass?
931206552903544832 2017-11-16 17:05:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RVAwonk Yeah. The knee-jerk reaction of people like @benshapiro shows that they really dont care about sexual harassment / assault.
931205131256741890 2017-11-16 16:59:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RVAwonk This is the perfect tweet.
931203136294760448 2017-11-16 16:51:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MelissaAFrancis Why havent you tweeted at all about Roy Moore?
931202745607979008 2017-11-16 16:50:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EsotericCD Your GOP would have allowed him to take his seat despite being anti-Muslim and many other awful qualities. Maybe you should reconsider regardless of what happens to Moore.
931202133046657024 2017-11-16 16:47:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ddale8 Wrong - totally wrong. You just cant help making a #BothSides point, eh?
931202011592142849 2017-11-16 16:47:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ddale8 @jehorowitz Yeah Daniel wtf are you talking about - there has been nearly none of this.
931201587371900929 2017-11-16 16:45:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SalenaZito You should also comment on Jayvies recent tweet about incubi and succubi
931192902839025664 2017-11-16 16:11:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel Why today?
931190526434349056 2017-11-16 16:01:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GlennF Whenever I reply to you or vice verse the blue bar on the bottom makes me think at first that you quote-tweeted me
931190168337358849 2017-11-16 16:00:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GlennF @daveweigel BTW Glenn your name is super-long
931190071826440193 2017-11-16 15:59:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GlennF @daveweigel Yeah this is totally fair Dave.
931188879343751168 2017-11-16 15:55:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SenFranken @ReaganBattalion I thought you should know that Marfan Mike has deleted his tweet. Im not telling you this because I like writing Marfan Mike.
931188563898540032 2017-11-16 15:53:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GlennF Ah, my bad.
931188291998588928 2017-11-16 15:52:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GlennF Nah, Franken isnt too big to fail.
931188010892247040 2017-11-16 15:51:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SenFranken @ReaganBattalion Im not sure if Marfan Mike is representative of liberals. My guess is that most liberals will condemn this.
931032449777205248 2017-11-15 05:33:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine @joshelman Its definitely newsworthy - this product category is legit. Keep at it Josh.
931018099729448961 2017-11-15 04:36:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @WalkerBragman And in fact, Doug Jones is nearly the perfect candidate to be positioned to take advantage of this situation.
931017925250519041 2017-11-15 04:35:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @WalkerBragman Or a simpler narrative is that Alabama bleeds red.

930919924863664128 2017-11-15 22:06:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Twitter @marykissel No problem. Yep reply is better. When you QT, the person you QTd may feel like you are inviting your followers to attack that person. This isnt that relevant to you, but people like Hannity and other similar folks do it a lot.
930919116801576960 2017-11-15 22:03:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marykissel Curious why you keep quote-tweeting me instead of just replying? Not a big deal - I dont care either way. But QTing isnt very conversationally friendly.
930918374418214912 2017-11-15 22:00:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marykissel You seem to give him the benefit of the doubt on big policy initiatives  why do you feel good about his intentions / likely efficacy?
930917653669060608 2017-11-15 21:57:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marykissel Im not changing the subject or missing your pt. I just dont believe anything that Trump says about policy that is allegedly driven by best interests of the United States. I just assume its all for show and hes not really going to get it done  similar to Middle East peace.
930916591763472384 2017-11-15 21:53:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marykissel I think we all just assume hes a liar who doesnt really care about anything thats not tied to his narrow personal political or financial interests.

930824846245732352 2017-11-15 15:48:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Patterico That was the point of Trumps preemptive tweet.

930652417099624448 2017-11-14 04:23:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hannity, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz - these guys didnt take action until everyone else had already denounced Moore.
930651230178746368 2017-11-14 04:18:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Incredible milestone - first time this year that Hannity has stopped one of his evil bullshit campaigns.

930525644651339776 2017-11-14 19:59:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaredkrouss Yes that's also a good reason. But I think if Luther Stranger were well-liked, like Lisa Murkowski was, he could still prevail. But I think the point I'm making above is the most important one - that Stranger doesn't want to alienate Moore supporters.
930507819681398784 2017-11-14 18:48:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaketapper can you report on why it took Ryan so long to come to this conclusion? Since everyone else already announced this, Ryan provided zero leadership on this issue.https://twitter.com/cnbc/status/930472440110747649
930495038970200064 2017-11-14 17:57:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> We all need to hold Bill and Hillary Clinton to the same standards that we expect from everyone else. Bill Clinton is a disgrace.https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/930448490563555328

930235539986423808 2017-11-13 00:46:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tedcruz @SalenaZito @jaketapper You should call out that Cruz was among the very last senators to make this call; he only withdrew support for Moore when it was 100% clear which way winds had shifted. This is at least half the news story; its not reasonable to simply announce his decision without this context.
930230703807119360 2017-11-13 00:27:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry Oh also a woman accused Judge Moore of trying to rape her.
930230573607428096 2017-11-13 00:27:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry People are being unfair to Sean Hannity and other people are unfairly jumping to conclusions about Judge Moore being banned from a shopping mall.
930228619804151808 2017-11-13 00:19:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz I would be pretty disappointed in Judge Moore given these accusations, if true.
930227100312678400 2017-11-13 00:13:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @edbott Said only after every other R senator had gone first. Hes a pedophile-sympathizer.

930222039176065024 2017-11-13 23:53:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion It's worrisome that people are disingenuous about Sean Hannity.
930221700657983488 2017-11-13 23:51:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ted Cruz is a pedophile-supporter. Nothing he can do from here will change that, ever.https://twitter.com/JoePerticone/status/930168796198899713

928065790456168448 2017-11-07 01:05:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> Mainstream Republicans want to focus on the guy Gillespie used to be, and ignore the race-baiting, the Confederate statue bullshit, etc.
928064832883933184 2017-11-07 01:01:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> His elite handlers want to hide their race-baiting tactics but this election was well-covered.

928025827005964288 2017-11-07 22:26:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DougHeye Maybe he sincerely believes Gillespies campaign was immoral and bad for America.

927934026676969477 2017-11-07 16:21:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benjaminwittes thoughts on Carter Page?
927731281542103040 2017-11-06 02:55:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi Well, I cant blame you for just doing what lots of people do. QTing is the norm.
927730178305933312 2017-11-06 02:51:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi To be clear I dont really care  just curious about how people think about QTing which I think is often bad for Twitter.
927730011884331008 2017-11-06 02:50:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi But its conversationally adversarial, dont you agree? You are calling out my point and shining a light on it, rather than simply engaging.
927729178329280512 2017-11-06 02:47:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi Curious - why did you quote-tweet me instead of just replying?
927728199731052544 2017-11-06 02:43:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi this is a rationalization for presenting falsehoods as truth
927718089856126976 2017-11-06 02:03:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rweingarten This seems like fake news

927689256105009152 2017-11-06 00:08:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz @RadioFreeTom If NRA flunkies can buy even 48 hrs w/ Now is not the time for politics 4 corners, they win  bc the synchronous anger/focus dissipates

927687664903495681 2017-11-06 00:02:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom @jpodhoretz R/NRA strategy is to squelch political engagement after every mass shooting, supported by NRA loons who make discussion impossible./1
927686186725806080 2017-11-06 23:56:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz @RadioFreeTom The worst thing for me today are those who are getting on their religious high horse attacking those who attack prayer etc.
927685945255641088 2017-11-06 23:55:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom @jpodhoretz Yes Im sure its boring to you.
927685459848847360 2017-11-06 23:53:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom @jpodhoretz Disagree  its good for Tom to call out gun zealots who mischaracterize positions of others. Not OK to let them spout BS w no pushback
927681263250522112 2017-11-06 23:37:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @WajahatAli I mean as bribes

927677521260191744 2017-11-06 23:22:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sarahfrier the way this is presented, including the headline, it looks like it's an official Bloomberg positionhttps://twitter.com/EdWGillespie/status/927675934253223937
927656479372410880 2017-11-06 21:58:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> ... to insult prayer-only as a response. If we change it to that, then its not just hard core left - all of us are insulting you.https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/927383135221723136
927651345854693377 2017-11-06 21:38:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry I never see R Sens/Reps getting behind any gun restriction proposals. Todays news that Cornyn may support new restrictions feels v rare.
927643004646580224 2017-11-06 21:05:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry Ah heres something that sounds good, but its pretty rare coming from the R sidehttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-06/cornyn-says-texas-shooting-may-prompt-look-at-background-checks
927641179025321984 2017-11-06 20:57:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry My impression: there isnt R support for restricting gun purchases by the mentally ill / domestic abusers but if so - major bipartisan opp
927638548810940416 2017-11-06 20:47:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson I dont understand why Republicans want it to be legal to sell guns to the mentally hill and to domestic abusers.
927613172403466240 2017-11-06 19:06:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry Not shocking. I just dont think GOP is really interested in addressing mental health care issues. Seems more of a political dodge re guns.
927612448042971138 2017-11-06 19:03:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry Support for MH care will be cut per DT/Congress proposals - no? And what laws need better enforcing? Not rhetorical - genuinely interested
927607546566754304 2017-11-06 18:44:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry Im asking which of the 2 is a more important priority, or I will weaken that  is (2) an important priority at all?
927606975071903744 2017-11-06 18:41:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RealJacobPerry So you think (1) ppl should carry more in church = better take on all of this vs (2) we should impose more regulation on gun ownership?
927597660923617280 2017-11-06 18:04:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaysonrodriguez Yeah Spotify playlists and charts make discovery incredible - US Top 50 + Todays Top Hits + Rap Caviar
927596391970439168 2017-11-06 17:59:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaysonrodriguez We are in a golden era right now - the music is incredible
927564099998715904 2017-11-06 15:51:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson Erick, your party talks only about prayer and ignores opportunities for action.

926220640088088576 2017-11-02 22:53:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jacklgoldsmith Eh lets cut RR some slack. Hes one of the 3 heroes so far. Whatever he needs to do to keep his job is fine

925934348074807297 2017-11-01 03:55:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KPhed Joe has been signaling for a while that hes playing for the neo-segregationist vote

925879955501629440 2017-11-01 00:19:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> Yes I agree. But I see no evidence that any of them are part of the leadership team. That tweet re Jake Tapper seems very on-strategy now.
925878912164380672 2017-11-01 00:15:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> Who at Fox News is open to the straighten up message? Whos the audience for your admonition?

925481185341403136 2017-10-31 21:54:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @IanMMcC @TheRickWilson If Republicans would unify & loudly condemn these folks, they could significantly reduce their power. But instead they play footsie.
925464238184742912 2017-10-31 20:47:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pwnallthethings @mtsw Yep. Given that Rs appear indifferent to morality/ethics, all we can count on is findings of criminality for regime change to happen.
925463617276854272 2017-10-31 20:44:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ben told me that this tweet was slander and then banned me. Is everyone at @FDRLST this sensitive?pic.twitter.com/c3Uc90tgtl
925235247876259840 2017-10-30 05:37:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bdomenech Right - compromise meant accepting a half-slave, half-free republic. I guess thats what Kelly would have preferred.
925233453259407360 2017-10-30 05:30:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bdomenech Maybe Im missing something - was there a compromise available that included ending slavery?

925132131487092737 2017-10-30 22:47:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TVietor08 @Litho_1sphere @MarcACaputo Yeah the problem is my logic, rather than your attraction to the safety of #BothSides.
925129096517918720 2017-10-30 22:35:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TVietor08 @Litho_1sphere @MarcACaputo Why do we need to agree to some kind of deal / compromise to agree that Mueller's investigation is legitimate? Your position is cowardly.
925126232244592641 2017-10-30 22:24:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TVietor08 @MarcACaputo I have no idea what that means.
925125603170295809 2017-10-30 22:21:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarcACaputo @TVietor08 Marc how about simply showing some integrity -- no matter how uncomfortable -- and support the Mueller investigation?
925106856262909952 2017-10-30 21:07:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Heminator Another interesting thing we learned today is that people on the Trump campaign were colluding with Russians.

922522827411963906 2017-10-23 17:59:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu @cwarzel Im impressed by CNN standing up for facts- meaningful improvement to their brand / its aspirational. They just need to fire Zucker.
922520752905101312 2017-10-23 17:51:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> Your fascist-president tells more lies per week than Obama told in 8 years. Congrats at being able to stay on message despite Trumps evil.https://twitter.com/arifleischer/status/922450209937993729
922358626525757440 2017-10-23 07:06:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanielBShapiro Moral equivalence is a tactic to argue nothing matters rather than actually help sort out right and wrong. Rs want to keep their scumbags.
922358396392583168 2017-10-23 07:05:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanielBShapiro Conservatives show similar moral equivalence between Trump and Harvey Weinstein. But again, liberals have denounced Weinstein.
922358196936699905 2017-10-23 07:05:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanielBShapiro Whatever liberals fell for Assange, they have now denounced him. Same cant be said for conservatives and Hannity.

922250368720961536 2017-10-22 23:56:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso @ditzkoff @redsteeze We should fire all harassers & jail everyone who has committed crimes, not throw our hands up because many ppl on both sides have done wrong
922249990805733381 2017-10-22 23:55:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso @ditzkoff @redsteeze Btw Im fine firing all the men on the Shitty Media Men list who have harassed - arent you? This seems straightforward to me.

922245423271518209 2017-10-22 23:36:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso Youve gotta be a Fox misogyny apologist to think I gotta try harder. I guess a competing example would be the Trump Organization.
922244901470744576 2017-10-22 23:34:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso @redsteeze @ditzkoff They should both be shut down with their leadership teams thrown in prison - Bob & Harvey Weinstein + Murdochs.
922244693701804032 2017-10-22 23:34:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso @redsteeze @ditzkoff Its hard to think of large org where sexual assault was more institutionalized than Fox News. But OK, lets say that FN is as bad as TWC.

921845587313442816 2017-10-21 21:08:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @louisjnelson Every time they lie if the worst outcome is that they are accused of misstating  no downside really
921844849631903744 2017-10-21 21:05:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @louisjnelson Your insistence on hyper-conservative characterization creates a hole for Trump and his people to lie nonstop; you are helping enable that
921825231735369728 2017-10-21 19:47:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @louisjnelson Misstated  you might as well be on Sarah Huckabee Sanders staff.
921824645355003904 2017-10-21 19:44:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @louisjnelson Either lied or made a big mistake  thats accurate. Misstated is extraordinarily weak and normalizing.
921822061885923328 2017-10-21 19:34:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @louisjnelson So what do you think happened here  he misremembered? This was an attack on a US Congressperson by the WH CoS.
921818796750340096 2017-10-21 19:21:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleyfeinberg do you know how we can figure out who makes headline decisions at NYT, Politico?https://twitter.com/marcbodnick/status/921817431776960512
921818555582103554 2017-10-21 19:20:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @louisjnelson Misstate implies an error or mistake, not a conscious decision to mislead.
921817431776960512 2017-10-21 19:16:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> .@louisjnelson why does the headline say misstate instead of lie?https://twitter.com/politico/status/921816398426525696

921504053737033728 2017-10-20 22:31:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MelissaAFrancis You said something important & wrong abt health ins & @mmfa corrected it. This reflects well on them, since no one else disagreed with you.
921464039712047104 2017-10-20 19:52:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Harvard @MelissaAFrancis @mmfa TBC Melissa is smart but this point abt insurance is obviously misleading & bad for viewers, to the extent they care abt not being ignorant.

921450358110535680 2017-10-20 18:57:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Harvard @mmfa @MelissaAFrancis Am I not disagreeing civilly? Or do you only want supportive replies? Id love feedback if Im using Twitter wrong.

921175140053876737 2017-10-19 00:44:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> Its not that Trump isnt any good at it. Its that hes a hateful selfish person w/so little empathy for others he cant even fake it.https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/921150054513172480

918840197508247553 2017-10-13 14:05:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleyfeinberg Would have been great if he applied that level of diligence to 2016 campaign coverage.

918621607391764481 2017-10-12 23:37:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom I agree re nuke threat: stupid. But not banning Trump for mult other b/w violations has contributed bigtime to Twitters general lawlessness
918621055702274048 2017-10-12 23:35:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Trump definitely should have been banned any number of times including insulting Mika about her facelift.

918573898349735936 2017-10-12 20:27:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Twitter @SRuhle @karaswisher Thats what I would have done when I ran moderation at Quora. This is an insane outcome.
918563997305229312 2017-10-12 19:48:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz I dont know what u are talking abt. Im reacting to you focusing on a misspelling when someone says that Trumps choices are endangering us
918563085568303104 2017-10-12 19:44:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz Yeah his misspelling is really the important thing
918559134546477056 2017-10-12 19:28:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jackfowler @ellencarmichael @CheriJacobus Cheri is totally right about this
918535511081345024 2017-10-12 17:55:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jackfowler Its #AllTrumpAllTheTime bc hes an existential threat to our syst of govt. I was an R but supported Hillary bc shes not a fascist.
918533029114527744 2017-10-12 17:45:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Twitter @SRuhle @karaswisher They could have just deleted the tweet and given her a warning.

918251282401443841 2017-10-11 23:05:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Its Gateway Pundit. Lazy is ridiculously, normalizingly charitable. GP is straight-up evil.https://twitter.com/rcallimachi/status/918245131949572096

918140731419586565 2017-10-11 15:46:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> But this is what you/your allies have brought us  a Pres who doesnt believe in constitutional protex. Hugh stand stronger against Trumphttps://twitter.com/hughhewitt/status/918114420169035781
918006432196280320 2017-10-10 06:52:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @panzer yeah that collar is better than the movies story
917912995635740672 2017-10-10 00:41:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @arthousegoon @jehorowitz Right. Here are some of my favoritespic.twitter.com/hH5BOYZljY
917912176773365760 2017-10-10 00:38:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @arthousegoon @jehorowitz Finding Dory is 94  can I say thats objectively inflated
917911880693194752 2017-10-10 00:37:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @arthousegoon @jehorowitz Sorry yep. But saying BR2049 is not an 89 (or 94 which is what it clocked heading into the weekend) borders on objectively true
917911422746558465 2017-10-10 00:35:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @arthousegoon @jehorowitz Studios have rigged RT by making it abt binary Fresh/Rotten rating & badgering critics to say Fresh (despite whatever actual review says)
917911053949747206 2017-10-10 00:33:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @arthousegoon @jehorowitz Scorsese is way off. If anything we have opp problem - RT overinflates reviews in favor of movie/studio. BR2049 was bad but clocks 89 on RT
917905376007172097 2017-10-10 00:11:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @seanhannity @NRO @jackfowler seems factual, unlike many of Seans attacks
917837463564910592 2017-10-10 19:41:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CNN @TomLevenson You cant seriously think CNN will do anything.
917830740850515968 2017-10-10 19:14:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> This guy is an idiot - as bad as Jeffrey Lord. The high priest of #BothSides.https://twitter.com/cillizzacnn/status/917739104254791680
917807030760386561 2017-10-10 17:40:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pt You are crushing it lately.
917283125054496768 2017-10-08 06:58:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @melvillmatic Your reviews are fantastic. Where can I find all of your old reviews organized by film?

916340615331192833 2017-10-06 16:33:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eliotwb Mmm. My instinct is that they are doing something right based on the #s.

916143510977372160 2017-10-05 03:30:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonfavs Jon who designed the new website?
916068041103773698 2017-10-05 22:30:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Remember: @BuzzFeedBen pushed the dossier story out last January in the face of huge countervailing pressures. Thank god for journalists.https://twitter.com/thebeatwithari/status/916065388126801921
915987830798663681 2017-10-05 17:11:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jcpolls So do you think Dems need to mostly give on this issue to win?
915728839245914113 2017-10-04 00:02:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @greenfield64 @EWErickson If our top diplomat, the former CEO of Exxon, thinks the President is a moron -- that's definitely news. Super-scary.
915727838346493952 2017-10-04 23:58:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @neilcybart Why?
915639995456565248 2017-10-04 18:09:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JGreenDC crazy - those movies are complete crap
915407728545226752 2017-10-03 02:46:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @seanmdav @beondeckdaily @eriktorenberg @rabois @sarthakgh Yep - I follow dozens of conservative writers, but like you and Keith I like seeing competing POVs.
915406388603453441 2017-10-03 02:41:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @beondeckdaily @eriktorenberg @rabois @sarthakgh But I think the vast majority of Twitter users engage in the same filter bubble behaviors as they do on FB.
915350322775678976 2017-10-03 22:58:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @politico @john_sipher Is it mean to think that he looks like a tool
915347241430261760 2017-10-03 22:46:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> No u called it a drone attack. Idea that viewers would understand you spoke figuratively is comical. We see you #SethRich #Pizzagate networkhttps://twitter.com/greggutfeld/status/914977448126746624

915281584672010240 2017-10-03 18:25:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rachanadixit Kelly called to give him a heads up - it was done
915275211624169472 2017-10-03 17:59:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @speechboy71 Ryan wants his friend/ally Price to know he was pulling for him?
915274989112221697 2017-10-03 17:58:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold Youve really destroyed Newsweek here
915274585808846848 2017-10-03 17:57:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rachaelmbade @jdawsey1 @rachanadixit Feels like non-story. Ryan lobbying for Price after hes fired seems like something youd do for a friend but not actually think itll work
915263233824407552 2017-10-03 17:12:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SalenaZito His post, like many from R Sens/Reps, is intellectually disingenuous. I wont lose sleep re whether Ive violated Twitters BNBR policy here
915258506164314112 2017-10-03 16:53:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mcwm Im dying.
915231671359750144 2017-10-03 15:06:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillClinton @SalenaZito @TomCottonAR No  why do you think so? Arent you supposed to be bright?
914992686167244800 2017-10-02 23:17:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro Curious why this is important
914965996040970240 2017-10-02 21:31:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jehorowitz This type of argument by @jpodhoretz is like Rs saying that NFL players are protesting the national anthem. Cynical.

913537857809145856 2017-09-28 22:56:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman The problem is that people are so upset that we have a fascist as president that it influences their judgment generally. People should silo!

912706922939170816 2017-09-26 15:54:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eringriffith if companies want more dedicated time from good directors, they probably need to pay them more.

912157059721785345 2017-09-24 03:29:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SteveDeaceShow Another funny one! I cant decide which is funniest.
912156925638217728 2017-09-24 03:28:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SteveDeaceShow This is hilarious except that you are making light of the cause of stopping police abuse and racism.

912080456492900352 2017-09-24 22:25:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro Are you serious - is this what you think the kneeling is about?
911818037346439168 2017-09-23 05:02:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleymayer @danielraffel Btw I dont think @NellieBowles has much feel for SV. This previous article was a joke -https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/style/steve-hilton-fox-news-silicon-valley-populist-pundit.html
911817382259081216 2017-09-23 04:59:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleymayer @danielraffel The fancy photo shoot makes him seem vaguely reputable and worth taking seriously as opposed to a disgusting misogynist and racist
911816411722293248 2017-09-23 04:55:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SteveDeaceShow You conservatives really dont like it when African-Americans protest.
911802098060115968 2017-09-23 03:58:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mikiebarb among others is awful lot of African-American people
911801701685792768 2017-09-23 03:57:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mikiebarb Mike Im a fan but this isnt the right context. The right context is that hes a fucking racist and so is his base.
911800513427116032 2017-09-23 03:52:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SteveDeaceShow @benshapiro This is absolute moral equivalence trash. You should be ashamed of yourself.

910336997851504640 2017-09-19 02:57:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCostTWS This is what happens when a fascist becomes president. People are suddenly more worried about the overall future than about sports, etc.

908908410640445440 2017-09-15 04:20:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ESPNPublicEd There is no good rationale for ESPN forcing @jemelehill to apologize other than $$. Your job is to publicly rationalize corporate cowardice.

908082258199769093 2017-09-13 21:37:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans IMO the over-negatives re Juicero etc are strongly counterbalanced by the positiveness re sexism/misogyny scrutiny
908079510863491072 2017-09-13 21:26:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans I'd focus on SoFi this week, not Bodega...
908077750249852928 2017-09-13 21:19:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans I think what's new is that people are shining a light on this set of problems and having the courage to stand up for themselves.
908077502890831872 2017-09-13 21:18:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans Maybe a bigger problem is widespread misogyny, sexism, and sexual harassment in the industry
908076396806680576 2017-09-13 21:14:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshgreenman @NoahCRothman I think it's because Trump himself is a fascist and doesn't care about a free and healthy press

907710232775630848 2017-09-12 20:59:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mikel_Jollett @ShutUpAndrosky Right exactly. You're glad we have Trump instead of Hillary.
907709648836243456 2017-09-12 20:56:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mikel_Jollett @ShutUpAndrosky Exactly! That's why Trump. Trump Trump Trump. Until we get what we want.
907709449107677184 2017-09-12 20:56:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ShutUpAndrosky @Mikel_Jollett Mikel I'm not serious
907709292018462720 2017-09-12 20:55:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mikel_Jollett @ShutUpAndrosky Exactly! This is why we sat on sidelines & tolerate Trump. You gotta play the long game - even if it takes decades of fasicsm.
907708938182787072 2017-09-12 20:54:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ShutUpAndrosky @Mikel_Jollett He didn't do single-payer HC or Wall St reform or student loan forgiveness, so we gotta keep being OK w/Trump until we get that stuff.
907708555943280640 2017-09-12 20:52:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mikel_Jollett @ShutUpAndrosky That's what I'm saying! Even though Trump is terrible we should be indifferent about him being in office until we get what we want.
907707964152176640 2017-09-12 20:50:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mikel_Jollett @ShutUpAndrosky We should keep working against Dems (or remain indifferent) & let Trump and his supporters win elections until Dems nominate good candidates

906590547598491648 2017-09-09 18:50:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshuaSGoodman My interp of this article is that many teachers don't like AP tests because they reveal objectively knowable results

904132238857474048 2017-09-02 00:01:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @boztank Another problem is that our president is a fascist who thinks of the press as the enemy and is encouraging everyone else to also.

901171848167043072 2017-08-25 19:58:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT @christinawilkie @nedflinders Huge thanks - awesome explanation
901170288875806720 2017-08-25 19:51:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT @christinawilkie Why? I don't understand. Isn't it OK for attorneys to defend despicable clients? (I'm serious.)
901138597448794112 2017-08-25 17:45:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bdomenech One possibility is that an alt-right person did this, right?

900851844687245312 2017-08-24 22:46:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @IndivisibleTeam So what stops Congress from proposing a bill to countermand the White House order?

900442452435152896 2017-08-23 19:39:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mcwm kinda
900431760445521920 2017-08-23 18:57:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thejongardner @Kantrowitz @mcwm For now maybe. But manufac capabilities are easier to acquire & develop vs what's coming in SW, SW/HW integration, battery eng & ML/AI/AD
900431000227860480 2017-08-23 18:54:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thejongardner @Kantrowitz @mcwm why. You think Ford knows something that Tim Cook can't figure out?

899826183373692928 2017-08-21 02:50:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AndrewCMcCarthy @DavidAFrench Have you posted any tweets about your opposition to NFL blackballing?
899825415119806465 2017-08-21 02:47:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AndrewCMcCarthy @DavidAFrench The problem players feel strongly & want to express their beliefs in a public way. I think blackballing gets your job done most effectively.
899824528133574656 2017-08-21 02:44:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AndrewCMcCarthy @DavidAFrench Based on these tweets it seems clear that NFL owners should work harder to blackball players who kneel during the national anthem
899822374777831425 2017-08-21 02:35:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> How will the NFL survive if all the Contributing Editors from the National Review stop watching?https://twitter.com/andrewcmccarthy/status/899819425292984320

899723782947954690 2017-08-21 20:04:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JGregRichardson Prob not: NYT obsession w H emails biased its readers  Rather: NYT biased other media outlets (eg CNN)/gave air cover for email obsession
899687182935367680 2017-08-21 17:38:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Quora @sapna @jwherrman @noahchestnut Quora's approach is to (1) enforce policy consistently and (2) explicitly tie every moderation decision to a clear policy.
899646866920398853 2017-08-21 14:58:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's possible to believe both that: 1. Hillary mis-executed/made many mistakes 2. The Times' coverage of the election was an abominationhttps://twitter.com/maggienyt/status/899646172440141825

899047360801546240 2017-08-19 23:16:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans @anildash Hey Ben what does inter alia mean
898721883394236416 2017-08-18 01:42:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MelissaAFrancis Disagree. Trump is a Nazi sympathizer and so are people who defend Trump's actions this week.

897699559505350656 2017-08-15 06:00:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bdomenech See, my main takeaway is "Tucker is a disgusting apologist for racism."
897697776699670528 2017-08-15 05:53:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bdomenech Good one Ben. Way to focus on what matters tonight. I can see how that's your main takeaway from Tucker's slavery graphic.

897523934240817153 2017-08-15 18:22:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SteveDeaceShow I really respect you and how you think, so very curious to hear your POV.
897523723112140800 2017-08-15 18:21:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SteveDeaceShow I mean, am I supposed to open-minded to the possibility that Trump will stop being a corrupt racist liar?
897522618256867328 2017-08-15 18:17:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SteveDeaceShow I know symmetry is appealing, but why is the anti-Trump view a cult?
897503625143926784 2017-08-15 17:01:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> We should ask Safra Catz and Mark Hurd to public renounce white supremacy and sever Oracle's ties with Trump's tech advisor groups.
897503220569743361 2017-08-15 17:00:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> In addition to biz & manufac councils, there's also a tech adv grp that includes Oracle -- Trump's #1 corp supporter in SV. #quitthecouncil

897251966853632000 2017-08-14 00:21:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso It just doesn't seem like a big deal to me. Bigger deal is Trump threatening the press & encouraging supporters to be violent toward press
897251504989413376 2017-08-14 00:20:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso I'm impressed by any WH reporter w/the courage to challenge the President in the face of POTUS labeling adversarial reporters as "the enemy"
897250757623169025 2017-08-14 00:17:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso Maybe I misunderstand foolishness. I'm glad Jim Acosta & others have the guts to challenge Trump on his lies, notwithstanding Acosta's flaws
897248337748910080 2017-08-14 00:07:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayCaruso "foolishness"? Is that what we're calling his Nazi sympathy?

896081907913334784 2017-08-11 18:52:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @parkerconrad I don't think that's what's happening here
896080289209794560 2017-08-11 18:46:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @parkerconrad I understand it's unusual to publicly take the side of a venture firm in a dispute with a founder.
896078800060006400 2017-08-11 18:40:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @imkialikethecar Totally predictable that a few founder-aligned investors would respond like this.
896077723050704896 2017-08-11 18:35:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Benchmark is obviously doing the hard work of being an engaged board member and company steward in a tough situation.
896077027895255040 2017-08-11 18:33:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @imkialikethecar "Backfires" because a few small investors send this letter?
896075431270432769 2017-08-11 18:26:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack @markmilian @MikeIsaac This doesn't look like a formidable alliance. Most investors prob happy Benchmark is doing hard work re clearing path to hiring CEO.
896074818113519617 2017-08-11 18:24:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack Are any of Uber's major investors in this group? Doesn't look it. Benchmark is doing the hard work that isn't fun or easy.
896073170607759360 2017-08-11 18:17:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @imkialikethecar Why do you say that

895341197664731136 2017-08-09 17:49:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DrDigiPol @gilgul @ShawnMusgrave Killer post. Shawn do you think most people in these private DM rooms have accounts with real names? Or do they mostly use pseudonyms?
895326373186650113 2017-08-09 16:50:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mhbergen A great product is more than just solving a bunch of discrete technical problems.
895326348155146242 2017-08-09 16:50:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mhbergen Eh this doesn't ring true as telling full story. This would be like arguing Apple is solving the same problems as everyone else re phones.

894986450604744705 2017-08-08 18:19:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ErikWemple Why is "unfamiliar" your conclusion, as if the problem is ignorance? How about "doesn't care about the truth"?

894795917357797377 2017-08-07 05:42:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @I_am_ryan_S Makes sense. I follow tons of progressive and conservative bloggers.
894795455917248512 2017-08-07 05:40:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Karoli Nah, it makes the company better to fire him, in multiple ways.
894776750722306048 2017-08-07 04:26:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> A guide to Twitter tonight: Google firing is an opportunity for anti-Trump Republican writers to re-establish their conservative bona fides.

894343504628928512 2017-08-06 23:44:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Btw calling people mean names is sop for the (1) white young male progressives + (2) Trump supporters who dominate Twitter pol discourse
894340790641545217 2017-08-06 23:33:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's incredible Twitter allows a verified user to attack another user this way. The product places zero value on civility. https://twitter.com/hasanthehun/status/894318244730818560

893940383834451968 2017-08-05 21:02:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jamespmanley Why? Seems good to have Miller's/Trump's ugly hatred more publicly exposed.

893690782531571713 2017-08-04 04:31:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NRO I'm worried that some Trump voters won't appreciate the thoughtfulness and nuance of this analysis.

892254115916505089 2017-07-31 05:22:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mgsiegler @adamnash I still like the show and agree that it's the best season 7 I've ever watched.
892253861028560896 2017-07-31 05:21:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mgsiegler So I'd be less ambitious - I agree it's v surprising how solid season 7 is, but I don't think the show is getting steadily better over time
892253568710750208 2017-07-31 05:20:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mgsiegler The first few seasons (through the Red Wedding) were clearly better than this season. And 5/6 were very patchy.

892247415348002817 2017-07-31 04:55:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NormOrnstein Mmm, I think he gets it, somewhat. Meaning, I think he's hearing Jeremy's POV from advisors, even if he doesn't understand why/how/etc.

890271058779029505 2017-07-26 18:02:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Tweetermeyer You don't like anything Elon does. I don't think you've ever posted something positive about one of his companies. Hence, less credibility.

889879611634470912 2017-07-25 16:06:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman It's not "paranoia." Trump has almost certainly committed many crime and be is rationally worried about getting caught. That's not paranoia.

889734731473997824 2017-07-24 06:31:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @David_Waddell And against use of pardons.   We need loud Republican leadership voices in favor of rule of law and opposing Trump autocracy
889734474711261184 2017-07-24 06:30:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @David_Waddell "Consistently anti-Trump" is too strong. He needs to vocally come out against firing Mueller.
889729669498494981 2017-07-24 06:10:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> Paul Ryan is a coward. Mitch McConnell is a Trumpist.   All eyes on McCain.
889728578253803520 2017-07-24 06:06:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> John McCain needs to face down Trump - this moment is when America most needs his couragehttps://twitter.com/newyorker/status/889726984338722816
889708472882810881 2017-07-24 04:46:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro @kausmickey I just unfollowed you. Tweeting that Trump was being supportive of Sessions with that tweet is just plain dishonest.
889693765635416065 2017-07-24 03:48:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT In fairness, Rudy's glow has diminished since Nov; you'd have to think he'd take job if it were actionable & Senate-confirmably available
889679367302860801 2017-07-24 02:51:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO You are smart.
889626824367423488 2017-07-24 23:22:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrislhayes I agree w the sentiment, but lesson from the last Senate effort = when dust settles, no one remembers or cares that they worked in stealth.
889615968279908354 2017-07-24 22:39:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pwnallthethings Don't you think Kushner is as/more important to protect given that Kushner is basically senior-most WH staffer (a la Haldeman/Ehrlichman)?
889563801233760260 2017-07-24 19:11:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rgoodlaw @chongathon do you have a different view?
889562570822041600 2017-07-24 19:06:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rgoodlaw Thanks Ryan!

889525676075761664 2017-07-24 16:40:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Sessions has tough choice - weighing his personal self-respect (resigning) vs how much he loves destroying minority communities (staying AG)https://twitter.com/nymag/status/889524827329110017

889223598124048384 2017-07-23 20:40:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @McFaul It's pretty obvious what's wrong. Pretending like it's a confusing mystery doesn't make sense.

888087681896284166 2017-07-20 17:26:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @can It is increasingly mostly Twitter
888087608718262273 2017-07-20 17:26:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jacklgoldsmith Good point, but my understanding is that any GOP atty interested in a LT GOP political career wants to avoid being part of the Mueller team.
888070565885468672 2017-07-20 16:18:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is a defining moment for McCain, Graham, Collins, Lee, Sasse.
888070381885468674 2017-07-20 16:17:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> It would be great if McCain came back with a roar & was a lot more aggressive in opposing Trump's corrupt and authoritarian rulehttps://twitter.com/senjohnmccain/status/888057312992260097

887927493843341312 2017-07-19 06:49:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pwnallthethings Question: if Trump fired Mueller, what would happen to all the other attorneys on Mueller's staff and their ongoing work?
887908972715323393 2017-07-19 05:36:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion I think you are a composite of 2-3 people, but on the other hand your voice is so strong so maybe just one
887884791596564480 2017-07-19 04:00:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion do we know who you are? Debating with a bunch of Quora friends

887459931439341568 2017-07-18 23:51:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thor_benson I think the idea is that Obama would be a lightning rod and his being more visible would make it easier for Trump to deflect attention.

887450837785522176 2017-07-18 23:15:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Does it really matter who the Ambassador is? My inference here is that Huntsman has less integrity than I thought.
887447713498845184 2017-07-18 23:03:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump isn't getting played by anyone.  He doesn't care about US national interests. All he cares about is maximizing personal power & wealthhttps://twitter.com/reaganbattalion/status/887445418614935552
887440132873179136 2017-07-18 22:33:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Karoli You think this will really happen? So many times Cornyn or McConnell has said a vote will happen it doesn't
887419746035015680 2017-07-18 21:12:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MelissaJPeltier @TrueFactsStated I agree with Melissa. I think ignoring whataboutism is the best approach
887182920686813184 2017-07-17 05:31:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin We would be thrilled not to have a lying fascist in power who was systematically undermining our institutions
887182390740664320 2017-07-17 05:28:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> Never have so many left-leaning Americans yearned for someone like Mike Pence to be our President

887082526719619072 2017-07-17 22:52:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Tweetermeyer Do you occasionally tweet thoughts that are optimistic about Tesla? I've probably just missed a few.
887081118591107076 2017-07-17 22:46:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Good for Chris Christie. To be clear, this is the bleeding edge of courage among current GOP elected officials.https://twitter.com/aravosis/status/887080776042504192

887069611467841536 2017-07-17 22:00:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @gaywonk I agree, but I think there is one specific question relating to all this -> whether Dems should lighten up on guns.

887023290237165568 2017-07-17 18:56:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @LeonHWolf Isn't it more word-efficient to summarize your conclusion with "Trump is lying again."

886998491645435905 2017-07-17 17:18:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin I'm not sure I agree with this either. I don't know if Fox supported Trump enthusiastically until it was clear that he was the nominee.
886998293170970624 2017-07-17 17:17:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin Fox News didn't wake up last week and decide on their own that rationalizing collusion with Russia should be a messaging priority.
886997895546781696 2017-07-17 17:15:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin I couldn't disagree more. Fox News is mostly focused on validating, supporting and rationalizing the Trump Administration.

886848888052662274 2017-07-17 07:23:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @genebsperling If question for Trump WH is "Will you [lie] to achieve [objective]?" the answer is always yes!

886828110305349632 2017-07-16 06:01:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @LukaNieto @jowrotethis I hear you, but it looks like Jon blindsided her on this decision. He should have given her a heads-up.
886827195171254274 2017-07-16 05:57:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jowrotethis @LukaNieto Her pt that he's at risk of being as dumb as Rob & Ned seems right. She can't hold her fire - gotta move him up Cersei learning curve asap
886825411664990209 2017-07-16 05:50:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz Yep - no one will remember tonight's scene
886771980803776512 2017-07-16 02:18:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoeNBC @michaelrwolfe Yeah I really admire the NeverTrump group of journalists & bloggers.
886756482523385856 2017-07-16 01:16:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoeNBC National Review readers: welcome. Bernie supporters: welcome. Whatever. Stalin & FDR didn't fight out their differences during WW2.
886755916917297152 2017-07-16 01:14:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoeNBC If you oppose Trump, you're a patriot. This is esp true if you are Republican -- you are paying a much higher personal cost than others.
886752432495009792 2017-07-16 01:00:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoeNBC If you have ever had a job where you need to get something hard done, you don't look to pick fights with people who want to help.
886752186113314816 2017-07-16 00:59:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> In the fight to remove Trump, we shouldn't subject allies to purity tests or criticize their pasts. Nobody's perfect. Welcome @JoeNBC I say. https://twitter.com/jaycosttws/status/886749029014568960
886746620502523904 2017-07-16 00:37:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaynordlinger Yep no one in power has the guts to say this
886733959492534273 2017-07-16 23:47:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JudgeJeanine @MaxBoot @Peter_Wehner "Doesn't understand" seems too charitable. Rejects.
886683271534264320 2017-07-16 20:25:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias @jasommer Huh weird. cc @stitchfix
886682240205299712 2017-07-16 20:21:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias @jasommer Everyone I talk to says Stitch Fix is crazy good at learning. That's a harder problem than just sending you more easy listening CDs
886668857871446017 2017-07-16 19:28:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @washingtonpost @ReaganBattalion Maybe they thought it was inaccurate / wrong
886667690194026497 2017-07-16 19:23:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nonfamousjay @RadioFreeTom @SeanTrende Definitely! But it's Menlo Park...
886666465524330496 2017-07-16 19:18:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nonfamousjay @RadioFreeTom @SeanTrende Yep. But my simplest point is:how would you describe what FN is doing? To me it verges on what I would associate with a fascist pol system.
886662984021319681 2017-07-16 19:05:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias Like Netflix
886662820695113728 2017-07-16 19:04:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nonfamousjay @RadioFreeTom @SeanTrende Is that sufficiently diplomatic?
886662801564999680 2017-07-16 19:04:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nonfamousjay @RadioFreeTom @SeanTrende I agree Nazi comparisons r unproductive. But what Fox/Trump are doing seems most similar to exps in non-US/non-democratic pol systems.
886662012750577664 2017-07-16 19:01:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nonfamousjay @RadioFreeTom @SeanTrende I think it's also important to understand the systematic lying/anti-truth strategy of Fox News.
886661641818873856 2017-07-16 18:59:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias Often because the company uses ML to figure out what you like.
886660006107521024 2017-07-16 18:53:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BrendanNyhan @JayWacker OK agree - ISIS is worse
886659893217722369 2017-07-16 18:52:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayWacker @BrendanNyhan Making 20% of America stupider & inflaming their hatred/ignorance - and these are not mentally impaired ppl doing it - is the worst sin IMO
886659759377530880 2017-07-16 18:52:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayWacker @BrendanNyhan I hear you. I don't think it's useful to compare extremes like this. I do think we underestimate the raw evil of Fox News.
886657796313198592 2017-07-16 18:44:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @thor_benson I dunno this seems to work for him/with his base
886657394155020288 2017-07-16 18:42:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nonfamousjay @SeanTrende @RadioFreeTom Sean this sounds like an apologist #BothSides rationalization for Trumpist systematic lying and false propaganda.
886656702958845952 2017-07-16 18:40:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FoxNews @MaxBoot OK I'm finally seeing the merits of your appearing on his show. You have real courage -- huge thanks.
886656200435089408 2017-07-16 18:38:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayWacker @BrendanNyhan Have at it.
886655061031387136 2017-07-16 18:33:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JudgeJeanine @justinhendrix Analogy - how we should have treated senior executives at tobacco companies who lied about dangers of smoking
886654401456201728 2017-07-16 18:30:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JudgeJeanine @justinhendrix I believe that if smart and informed people shine a light on Fox News evil it can make a difference.
886652813777879040 2017-07-16 18:24:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JudgeJeanine @justinhendrix Can we say traitor instead of false patriot?
886652328668938242 2017-07-16 18:22:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brithume @HowardKurtz What's your point? Brit Hume carries water for Trump (like all Fox News ppl) and knows nothing about legal issues. Why tweet this?
886650797353615360 2017-07-16 18:16:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BrendanNyhan @JayWacker She's straight-up evil, along w Tucker, Hannity, Bolling, etc. I can't think of a group of people doing more evil.
886649225441722368 2017-07-16 18:10:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisgeidner @I_am_ryan_S My pt: anti-women ppl aren't "forgetting what happened in the past." They don't care; they r hellbent on making pt abt world becoming too PC

886397833779200000 2017-07-15 01:31:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray @SouthernKeeks @ShannonPoe @can Fox News people have had years to come to terms with their company's evil. I have no sympathy for anyone who chooses to work there.
886397344610107392 2017-07-15 01:29:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray @SouthernKeeks @ShannonPoe @can Right I'd say no.
886397113797562368 2017-07-15 01:28:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray @SouthernKeeks @ShannonPoe @can Good question. I'm personally cutting back my associations/time spent with Trump supporters.
886396723467243520 2017-07-15 01:27:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray @SouthernKeeks @ShannonPoe @can Yep.
886392142033149952 2017-07-15 01:08:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @matthewamiller Eh Occam's Razor is this Trump wants him on TV and McGahn/Priebus won't defend Russia

886341494990266368 2017-07-15 21:47:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray @SouthernKeeks @can @ShannonPoe FNC is arguably most evil privateco in US. They purposefully, systematically tell lies, make viewers ill-informed, inflame racism & misogyny
886339271375831040 2017-07-15 21:38:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleyfeinberg Maybe she has good self-preservation instincts
886337211016151040 2017-07-15 21:30:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray @SouthernKeeks @can Like if you work at Fox News, you should be ostracized by your friends until you quit.
886336896229453824 2017-07-15 21:29:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray @SouthernKeeks @can These racists/misogynists should be socially punished.
886336875459301376 2017-07-15 21:29:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray @SouthernKeeks @can On the contrary, these racists don't get called out enough. I was joking; couldn't care less if she blocks me.
886335224904204288 2017-07-15 21:22:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray @SouthernKeeks @can I'm sad to say that @southernkeeks blocked me for calling her a racist

886331375489474560 2017-07-15 21:07:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> Is this tweet as racist as it sounds? I don't see alt interp. Also since he's blocked you @support should consider this harassment & ban you https://twitter.com/southernkeeks/status/885956649655177216

886046527667425280 2017-07-14 02:15:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brithume you Fox guys are quick to tell an exculpatory story on Trump's behalf. We should stick w @benjaminwittes who tries to be objective

885999052663291904 2017-07-14 23:06:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricBoehlert What do you think are Dershowitz's motives? Do you think he has a client paying him to say stuff like this?
885998338117468160 2017-07-14 23:03:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CahnEmily Yeah although I think it's empirically true that many people do like it. Beats jacked up the bass in their headphones.

885547522294374401 2017-07-13 17:12:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel This would be a better point if it weren't so clear that Trump himself is generally ignorant about US history.
885541478109401088 2017-07-13 16:48:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think this is the most important tweet I've seen today. We need to stop focusing on Trump's base. https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/885525207649308677

885324940429348864 2017-07-12 02:28:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisgeidner Fair enough. And you are obviously a force for good. But I think the media shies away from the L word too often.
885322857907068928 2017-07-12 02:19:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisgeidner Instead of saying "is not credible" I would use the words lie, lying, and liars. "Is not credible" doesn't get the job done.

884822697749893121 2017-07-11 17:12:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eliotwb Certainly it's hard to get traction. I guess the theory is that it's easier once you breakthrough/become a habit.
884821539215900674 2017-07-11 17:07:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eliotwb We are mixing up 2 many things. Some startups r slashing prices bc no mkting needed; others are improving S&M via various online strategies
884820942068760576 2017-07-11 17:05:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eliotwb Huh. Well, maybe not Harry's. But generally a category thesis is that consumers pay too much because trad marketing is so $$
884820421572386816 2017-07-11 17:03:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eliotwb Well, there ideas are generally based on online distro / v low marketing costs, which in turn allows the startup to slash product pricing.
884819470916636672 2017-07-11 16:59:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eliotwb This is an appealing startup category for non-technical founders; you see MBAs starting these companies

884470245921914880 2017-07-10 17:51:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @washingtonpost @McFaul If Trump is basically a Russian agent, how is it a mistake? Doesn't make sense to me to frame this as a strategic or tactical error.
884427061917491201 2017-07-10 15:00:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> The baseline is that *anyone* speaking for Trump, including Tillerson and McMaster, is probably lying when answering a tough questionhttps://twitter.com/braddjaffy/status/884371719888220160
884305646815911936 2017-07-09 06:57:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PhilippeReines Appreciate it. You are smart.

884248721600290816 2017-07-09 03:11:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Mueller going for quick indictment against Jared or Donald Jr. is plausible; they aren't protected from indictment like Trump is, and...

884184927704555520 2017-07-09 22:58:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's fascinating (and appalling) to see the progressive-left emphasize skepticism re: Russia interference/collusion.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/884184410861355009

884178074895499265 2017-07-09 22:30:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianstelter @NumbersMuncher Like the Pizzagate morons who thought the story was legit.
884177929034375168 2017-07-09 22:30:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianstelter @NumbersMuncher Problem is that there are multiple audiences for alt-right msgs. Dumbest people -- who account for a significant % -- take it seriously.
884166551858929664 2017-07-09 21:45:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom This is distracting from the airline shoes & manners kerfuffle
884147462058917888 2017-07-09 20:29:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump is putting GOP House members & Senators in a tough spot by not giving them even a flimsy cover that he isn't a Russian agent. Brutal.
884139982427873280 2017-07-09 19:59:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump didn't bother faking it -> ie to try to give impression of neutrality / skepticism / strength. Shocking. He *must* be a Russian agent.
884139586926129153 2017-07-09 19:57:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> To state obvious: fact that Trump was so transparent in his Putin mtg -> implies heaviest imaginable Trump dependency/indebtedness to Putin

883895669836075008 2017-07-08 03:48:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BCAppelbaum If we agree/publicly acknowledge that Trump is likely a Russian agent, we can stop asking questions like these. More efficient.

883525189136392195 2017-07-07 03:16:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ebekiel @JYSexton If we accept Trump is a Russian agent, maybe that changes how we think about statements like this.

883490305030332416 2017-07-07 00:57:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @McFaul Why isn't the clear answer: because Trump is a Russian agent
883474141709443072 2017-07-07 23:53:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> Right - this is key point -> if we stipulate Trump = Russian agent whose interests are aligned with Russia, then ans to this question is obvhttps://twitter.com/PGourevitch/status/883473701999710208

883343025321107456 2017-07-07 15:12:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ThePlumLineGS Awesome to call this out. Now we should say it every time we discuss the politics of the bill, rather than pretending GOP cares about issue.
883191577761501185 2017-07-06 05:10:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Huh, interesting. I really respect your POV. Appreciate the engagement.

883190500525613056 2017-07-06 05:06:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion We can blame this on the press, or we can point to the fact that he has reputation as a consistent liar.
883189542026592256 2017-07-06 05:02:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Because nobody believes it, for good reason. He acts like he is a Russian agent.

882995992097808384 2017-07-06 16:13:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ThePlumLineGS What I'm saying is: Why would he/his WH do anything to curtail Russia? They are helping him / they are an ally of his.
882995656259796992 2017-07-06 16:12:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol Republicans didn't worry about this tension during Obama's (or Clinton's) terms in office. And now we've got a real fascist in the WH.

882976017773584386 2017-07-06 14:54:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ThePlumLineGS Greg, it's not useful to have this discussion without calling out the strong alignment of politcal interest between Trump & Putin.

882735114236575744 2017-07-05 22:57:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @amir Yeah agree of course. OTOH a contrarian perspective is that dumb people have volume & can be heavily influenced by old media -> eg local TV

882654371455959040 2017-07-05 17:36:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bhorowitz @casey__allen Yes, being public makes short-term pain more painful.
882654023924424704 2017-07-05 17:34:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dustin Yes I agree. They are trying to trim the extremes without cutting into current engagement.
882651941666398208 2017-07-05 17:26:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dustin You'd have to block/ban tons of users in enforcing rules. Twitter would lose a significant % of current engagement/usage/users.
882648835847106560 2017-07-05 17:14:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> But as @bhorowitz says when you forget to add sugar it's too late once the cake is baked.
882648676824342528 2017-07-05 17:13:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter at this point arguably makes the world worse by amplifying polarization and anger (and trolling). Good moderation could have helped.

882628471909777408 2017-07-05 15:53:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JasonKander "Beyond stupid" implies a mistake in judgment. This is just authoritarian corruption / an attempt to grab power / undermine democracy.
882627987882913792 2017-07-05 15:51:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CNN @ReaganBattalion Yeah whether or not Trump was a corrupt scumbag she might have left!

882621869202882560 2017-07-05 15:27:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @shannonrwatts But I think it's reasonable to call him the frontrunner, no?

882457872893829121 2017-07-04 04:35:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> CNN should've released the name/background of the guy who made the video. That's interesting news. There's no right-not-to-be-identified

882306144227573762 2017-07-04 18:32:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Of course Twitter won't even purge fake accounts like Instagram did. Spinelessness is the norm.
882276634375593984 2017-07-04 16:35:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> So cowardly to not edit-block Trump after his Mika tweet
881978403074621440 2017-07-03 20:50:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's hard for me to think of anything interesting that is coming out of Texas these days.https://twitter.com/elyseea/status/881922532827213824

881962198943227905 2017-07-03 19:45:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine @chrisamccoy The Sprint investors are probably clueless.
881962054805970946 2017-07-03 19:45:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> I've said this over and over - if you don't have the guts to ban popular users who break the rules, your moderation system has no integrity https://twitter.com/ajs/status/881961462071271424
881961360904511488 2017-07-03 19:42:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine @chrisamccoy Maybe Tidal will be acquired in next year or so. The product has zero future as a standalone thing.
881960872221958146 2017-07-03 19:40:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mazhxri I see. As someone who has zero interest in Tidal they are doing a good job of training me to wait 1-2 weeks to hear new releases.
881960607381020673 2017-07-03 19:39:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisamccoy I haven't heard one song from the album and I'm a huge fan. Nobody has heard it!
881960573453312000 2017-07-03 19:39:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisamccoy I completely disagree 4 any artist who isn't a Tidal shareholder. And even for Jay-Z, distro isn't "baked in."
881959066397925376 2017-07-03 19:33:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisamccoy I don't understand. How is it good that meaningfully fewer people are listening to the album (vs normal distribution)?
881958553438740484 2017-07-03 19:31:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> Tidal is roadkill. You can't make a media product work with content exclusives.
881957836929982464 2017-07-03 19:28:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's insane that no one I know has listened to the album.
881951629984935936 2017-07-03 19:03:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> Jay-Z is bringing piracy back by making his new album a Tidal/Sprint exclusive. Nobody wants either.

879468525181599744 2017-06-26 22:36:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @McFaul Trump's default is to lie about anything self-serving. Seems like that should be the settled context for any review of his words...

878696549605408768 2017-06-24 19:29:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> The Justin Calbeck situation may make Binary Capital a poor investmenthttps://twitter.com/techmeme/status/878692074756988928
878679992770670595 2017-06-24 18:23:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericries Depends on the facts but he has rounded up a group of eager beaver killers.
878624717170552832 2017-06-24 14:43:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin Republicans (or at least their leaders) are 100% aligned with Russians. Republicans don't want to know what happened.
878603850298658816 2017-06-24 13:20:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kylegriffin1 Clinton analogue makes clear that McGahn could have chosen to play a more active role here
878603712066969600 2017-06-24 13:20:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kylegriffin1 Pretty clear McGahn doesn't *want* involvement in the Russia investigation & that's a big part of why Trump is so mad at him.
878593413553238016 2017-06-24 12:39:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> The Andrew McCarthy post seems to ignore fact that Trump is congenital liar who should get no benefit of the doubt re the truth
878593137886855170 2017-06-24 12:38:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> If others officials colluded, how can u feel confident (b4 investigation) Trump doesn't share responsibility? Esp since he is such a liarhttps://twitter.com/jpodhoretz/status/878591588238319616
878578605336473601 2017-06-24 11:40:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelrwolfe Mueller seems effective & results oriented. He'll optimize given constraints: - GOP determined not to impeach - Trump wants to fire you
878512841157996544 2017-06-24 07:19:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin My sense is that many Republicans have come to that conclusion. Also, 75% of them don't think Russia interfered with the 2016 election.
878496004575830016 2017-06-23 06:12:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelrwolfe He may bring quick indictments against non-Trump actors.
878495918571622401 2017-06-23 06:12:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelrwolfe Maybe. Another thought I have is that Mueller wants to move asap given that the Sword of Damocles is swinging over his head.
878494596963151876 2017-06-23 06:06:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> Theory: Mueller intends to deliver such a slam-dunk summary of charges that the House will have to impeach.

877994119435501568 2017-06-22 20:58:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @parkerconrad It presents no new info. And it fails to even acknowledge that Travis has super-control. Plenty of other stories have criticized the board.

875457894656888834 2017-06-15 21:00:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> Prediction: Mueller will announce that he's hired two high-profile Republican attorneys/prosecutors to join the team -- over next 1-2 weeks.

875425259955961856 2017-06-15 18:50:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> I wonder if Trump is thinking about firing Sessions so he can have an AG not recused from Russiagate (and who can therefore fire Mueller)https://twitter.com/paul_bettany/status/875423097805045765

873711821840031744 2017-06-10 01:21:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ChrisMarsicano Sure seems that way. If he's the only challenger, I wonder if he has a chance.

873679763918934016 2017-06-10 23:14:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @can It's not casual disregard. Republican interests are aligned with the Russians.
873678827032944641 2017-06-10 23:10:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> And all of this eclipses the reality that Republicans are fine with Russian attacks if they help Republicanshttps://twitter.com/maggienyt/status/873678164760723456

873371951405744128 2017-06-09 02:51:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @abhinavsharma You need a complete library in music (as @xamat always tells me)
873328696706220032 2017-06-09 23:59:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm confident they'll figure it out. They know ppl want good integrated lyrics. I predict they buy Rap Genius for a small amount pretty soon
873327532577234949 2017-06-09 23:54:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> In the future, artists will cut out the labels and publish directly to Spotify (not SoundCloud).
873327428629692416 2017-06-09 23:54:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> As more and more holdout artists bend the knee to Spotify, the music industry gets closer to the brink.
873323618918211584 2017-06-09 23:39:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> Spotify is completely aligned w/consumers & music listeners, which is awesome. It will be a great day when the trad music industry collapses
873323316576083968 2017-06-09 23:37:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> Artists & labels have been anti-consumer for decades - making ppl buy $20 albums w/2-3 good songs; adding tons of friction to digital; etc
873322902761783296 2017-06-09 23:36:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Taylor Swift agreeing to put her music on Spotify is a triumph for the consumer

872937623987208192 2017-06-08 22:05:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Leaders who have corrupted themselves for Trump: Ryan, Giuliani, Christie, Rubio, Dershowitz, Mickey Kaus. Quote-tweet if you have more.https://twitter.com/alandersh/status/872884490334609408
872935988728700928 2017-06-08 21:58:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JGregRichardson Btw there's plenty we may not know as normal citizens re evidence of obstruction. Based on yesterday, the IC guys clearly know more
872926443675672577 2017-06-08 21:20:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JGregRichardson Reading Dershowitz is a waste of time. He is basically a Trump advocate/proxy.
872922396230991872 2017-06-08 21:04:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JGregRichardson I'm saying that Dershowitz is a Trump shill

872826755186171904 2017-06-08 14:44:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> FBI employees are one of Comey primary audiences.
872644730097553408 2017-06-07 02:41:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Too much racism can give you a headache and makes you feel bad about yourself, but not enough racism leaves you wanting more.

872620443542237184 2017-06-07 01:05:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol @MattGlassman312 But Trump's credibility with Republican base seems huge - greater than Reagan's?
872620208627765248 2017-06-07 01:04:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol @MattGlassman312 I do think Neustadt would have a field day analyzing 2017 as Hazards of Transition example
872619946609565696 2017-06-07 01:03:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol @MattGlassman312 One counter to this - Republicans need/want Trump to sell tax cuts for rich people to Trump voters. Only Trump can sell GOP policies.
872602566722441216 2017-06-07 23:53:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> Every time there is a public event as important as the Comey hearings I think about how valuable Rap Genius is.https://twitter.com/PeterWStevenson/status/872530995802779648

871835509424652288 2017-06-05 21:05:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac Movie reviews are the worst. So many bad movies get tons of positive reviews. I feel like anything with a RT score < 80 is probably crap.

870071438471909378 2017-05-31 00:16:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KPhed I suspect he and Mueller have thought this through...
870058573450969088 2017-05-31 23:25:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> This actually is some crazy politics 4D chess. I'm crediting Rosenstine for outplaying everyone else.
870058062903627776 2017-05-31 23:23:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> He's played his cards about right -- including getting into a position (re Comey) where he can assert he was mistreated/exploited.
870057754513125376 2017-05-31 23:21:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> He doesn't get to do any of this if he doesn't have his job, and have credibility with Trump and Sessions.
870056548726300674 2017-05-31 23:17:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> Not only did he pick a special prosecutor, he picked Mueller. That was the key outcome so far.
870056410884710400 2017-05-31 23:16:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm not confident of this view, but so far Rod Rosenstine seems like the one hero of the administration
870042683183554560 2017-05-31 22:21:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr @hannahlonglong TBC I believe she does lack charisma/connection w mainstream voters. This also contributed to defeat. She was a bad candidate in many ways.
870042289527181313 2017-05-31 22:20:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr @hannahlonglong Ah, I see your point. I'm criticizing how she lays blame w/o owning responsibility. I meant to criticize her content not style.
870038973900439552 2017-05-31 22:07:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @reidhoffman @hadip built
870034064064954368 2017-05-31 21:47:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hillary post-mortem takeaway: next Democratic nominee should be someone who knows how to get shit done. This rules out most (all?) Senatorshttps://twitter.com/MarcBodnick/status/870013955921518593
870032255925628928 2017-05-31 21:40:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois Right. The thing is: she doesn't need to point to other factors - many others are on top of them (Mueller, etc.). She should just own it.
870030544846823424 2017-05-31 21:33:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr @hannahlonglong And given her terrible choices re speaking fees, the CF fundraising, and the private email server - she was a weak candidate from the start
870030178600099840 2017-05-31 21:32:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr @hannahlonglong Or tuned her geographic focus better.   Trump is a fascist, our country made a terrible choice, and Hillary executed poorly. All 3 are true.
870024440188329984 2017-05-31 21:09:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr And her judgment abt the emails and CF were atrocious. Her defensiveness about all this signals is inconsistent w/being a strong executive.
870024129373548544 2017-05-31 21:08:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr A strong leader/executive simply doesn't talk the way she does. She obv could have better executed and won given the razor-thin margin.
870023140277051393 2017-05-31 21:04:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr I respectfully disagree. She is not taking ownership. She could've won via better execution or by not doing the stupid email stuff.
870017510170443777 2017-05-31 20:41:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Taytus Taking full ownership for execution/outcomes is what all good leaders do.
870016036904419328 2017-05-31 20:36:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pooter03 If you are a Trump opponent, you should be obsessed with execution - which Hillary is not
870015864753471489 2017-05-31 20:35:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pooter03 I have published many complaints about Trump
870014606327939072 2017-05-31 20:30:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> No good CEO makes excuses like this, regardless of the circumstances. Ownership of execution and outcomes is what leaders do.
870014384575098880 2017-05-31 20:29:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> Obviously she could have won by executing better! She just needed a few more votes and her opponent was atrocious.

867158023801782272 2017-05-23 23:19:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JakeSherman Seems aggressive to be criticizing the Washington Post about scoops.
867156774507339777 2017-05-23 23:14:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mims Oh right Etsy > Tumblr
867156598409412608 2017-05-23 23:13:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mims Maybe http://Jet.com and Tumblr
867155919162847232 2017-05-23 23:10:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mims @teddygoff The deals in Naperville are probably no worse than those in Chicago
867155803479855104 2017-05-23 23:10:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mims To that pt, the raw #s on your graphic belie the low quality of tech deal flow outside SFBA & Seattle. What's the biggest exit ever in NYC?
867154262010109953 2017-05-23 23:04:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mims Huge deal flow also in the Chicago/Naperville area
867150592686280704 2017-05-23 22:49:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is Fox News yellow journalism playbook. Another example: last Oct when @BretBaier tweeted rumor that Hillary was about to be indictedhttps://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/867114021270552577

867091945268494336 2017-05-23 18:56:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonnyNemo @traveling_chica @sweetgreen @richardhenry That 5-8 mins means we can't easily double-park & run in/out. Whole pt of order-ahead is 2b quick. We want SG to toss b4 we arrive/not after
867091494967975936 2017-05-23 18:54:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonnyNemo @traveling_chica @sweetgreen @richardhenry You save customers valuable time by having order-ahead app, but then you cost us 5-8 mins by making us wait on your team to toss the salads
867089644441092096 2017-05-23 18:47:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> We shouldn't let FN off the hook. FN is responsible for making older Americans dumber & more hateful, and they should be held accountable.
867085168128925696 2017-05-23 18:29:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is the classic, toxic Fox News MO. You can't work at that place and have integrity.https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer/status/867084885000728577
867084568351784960 2017-05-23 18:27:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jeremysliew If prod development stops/products don't keep getting better, a company/category won't get huge. Greatness comes from prod dev, not brand.
867062269724639232 2017-05-23 16:58:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> Doesn't make sense - With parity: distro - and sometimes commoditization - wins  - In most great cons tech categories, parity doesn't happenhttps://twitter.com/jeremysliew/status/867052064886665218
867057647517810689 2017-05-23 16:40:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jeremysliew Sounds good, but "parity" isn't relevant stage for any major cons tech product - G, A, FB/Insta/WA. IOW in consumer, product wins, period.
867056201044869120 2017-05-23 16:34:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> In a few years, everyone will come to understand that Quora is one of the most important companies on the internethttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/866912050173272064

866896225727008769 2017-05-22 05:59:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @robennals iMessage for example is terrible
866896158886551552 2017-05-22 05:58:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @robennals Also, both companies are getting a ton of competition from independent apps (WhatsApp, Spotify, etc.). Doesn't seem to be helping.
866895567187619840 2017-05-22 05:56:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @robennals Apple's software applications are generally degrading despite Google competition.

866891115911303168 2017-05-22 05:38:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry @jedmund Ah, so I stupidly bought one just now. It's like me buying a Model X just before Hardware 2 shipped. I never get it right.
866890552788131840 2017-05-22 05:36:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jedmund Damn @richardhenry check this shit out. This is what we've been talking about - whether Google is on the verge; based on the Pixel I say no
866889645434458112 2017-05-22 05:32:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jedmund Wait, so if you and me are playing god, we have Google be responsible for the core mobile OS?
866887900452970498 2017-05-22 05:25:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom North or South?
866887494616338433 2017-05-22 05:24:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BakerWoods @richardhenry Yeah that's what I meant! Actually I don't understand any of this
866887035675582469 2017-05-22 05:22:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BakerWoods Huh? I feel like iOS is part of what I'm paying for when I buy the phone. @richardhenry maybe you can figure this out
866886120386121728 2017-05-22 05:18:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> I want an iPhone with great built-in Google services support
866886055361892352 2017-05-22 05:18:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Would be a better world if Apple stuck to phones/iOS and Google stuck to services

866881752425308160 2017-05-22 05:01:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ptraughber One example - clicking on tweets and quoted tweets and having them slide over
866880330002685952 2017-05-22 04:55:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> Just got an Android phone for the first time (a Pixel). Twitter is a tiny bit slower on Android, yes?

866686088961597440 2017-05-22 16:04:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is like Dave

866476102494986240 2017-05-21 02:09:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ethank @elonmusk Works the same for Hardware 1 and 2?

866444477803634688 2017-05-21 00:03:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katiepack Sure I agree. They can watch on YouTube. But in terms of taking action, this seemed pretty good to me. I would have done this myself.
866442936354865152 2017-05-21 23:57:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katiepack i.e.,https://twitter.com/creynoldsnc/status/866442741156335616
866442490152222720 2017-05-21 23:56:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT @chick_in_kiev I feel trolled
866441779712622592 2017-05-21 23:53:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katiepack But even if Pence has a rep as an original orator, it's valid for students to express unhappiness with Trump/Pence by walking out quietly
866441185493008384 2017-05-21 23:50:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katiepack To be clear, I honestly don't know the answer to these questions
866441081025581056 2017-05-21 23:50:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katiepack Well I guess there are 2 ways to answer: 1. Did he say anything new today? 2. Does he have track record of saying new things in speeches?
866440673133699072 2017-05-21 23:48:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katiepack The students didn't limit/infringe Pence's right to speak
866440265887662084 2017-05-21 23:47:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katiepack Seems like peacefully protesting by walking out was reasonable. Pence wasn't going to say anything new.
866437598142529536 2017-05-21 23:36:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT @chick_in_kiev I was asking Maggie

866425624126267393 2017-05-21 22:49:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JaneMayerNYer Do you know roughly how much R ppl/groups spend on politics/campaigns/pol orgs each yr vs Ds?
866327390636593157 2017-05-21 16:18:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Maidenberg Comcast ownership drives NBC's badness. Example: canceling @Lawrence
866327175116357632 2017-05-21 16:17:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Maidenberg Yes.
866326947734757376 2017-05-21 16:16:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Maidenberg Yeah. I lump in NBC (home of Matt Lauer, Jimmy Fallon, Andrea Mitchell) with AP, CNN
866326592854806528 2017-05-21 16:15:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Rosenstine picking Mueller is consistent with this theory
866326563775594496 2017-05-21 16:15:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> I mean, I'm not counting on this, but if this theory is right, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference right now.
866326279221526528 2017-05-21 16:14:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> There's some chance McMaster, Mattis and Rod Rosenstine are playing a long game here. You can't flip the switch if you aren't in the seat.https://twitter.com/20committee/status/866325644946407424
866057995708276736 2017-05-20 22:28:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @LouiseMensch @johnastoehr I feel like we should be pounding on the New York Times in particular - what a fiasco their 2016 coverage
866057698705424385 2017-05-20 22:27:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @LouiseMensch @johnastoehr MSM failed to adequately report on Russia-Trump ties in run-up to the 2016 election - IMO that's a much bigger problem than Louise Mensch

865674118665969664 2017-05-19 21:02:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo Flynn is definitely on his way to jail. The question is whether Mueller and team can get him to flip on everyone else.
865672954121601024 2017-05-19 20:58:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> Internet time is crazy. I literally can't remember when Comey was fired.
865668975568461825 2017-05-19 20:42:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's apparently a mystery why this guy at Goldman Sachs doesn't want to join the Trump Administrationhttps://twitter.com/davidmwessel/status/865665991140704256

865645119071936513 2017-05-19 19:07:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is super-exciting - like history brought to life. So much easier to teach the kids about Watergate when it's actually happening again.https://twitter.com/abbydphillip/status/865644580263256065

865438547175546880 2017-05-18 05:26:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion Mmm. I'd guess that they enjoyed bragging to him about how they were helping - like Giuliani. I doubt they could help themselves.

865318468626731008 2017-05-18 21:29:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JayWacker Well, that Cabinet looks loyal, so I can't believe it would happen. OTOH if Mattis & Tillerson locked arms, maybe others would fall in line.
865305113279123456 2017-05-18 20:36:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hard to explain what's going on generally without introducing the idea that Trump has some kind of mental/medical/psychological problemhttps://twitter.com/pbump/status/865303558471733249

865293906719588352 2017-05-18 19:51:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @helen_min I suspect Flynn's decision calculus now has nothing to do with public sentiment or ethics
865293680638218240 2017-05-18 19:51:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pt I don't think so - this really looks like someone trying to get a friend/former coworker to keep their mouth shut

865284098838806528 2017-05-18 19:13:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's pretty obvious Flynn could destroy Trump and this explains Trump's ongoing support of Flynnhttps://twitter.com/noahshachtman/status/865283233877032960
865276889820045317 2017-05-18 18:44:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaypinho @zackbeauchamp The love of Fox News and bullshit (#Pizzagate #SethRich) - we've known for a while that these folks don't want to know the truth
865269129229475840 2017-05-18 18:13:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lpolgreen To clarify - it's not actually raining in Yemen right? I'm new to TheSkimm
865264034441863172 2017-05-18 17:53:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaypinho @zackbeauchamp Why revealing? Trump's core base voters aren't onions.
865255071847546880 2017-05-18 17:17:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry Yeah. Arya could report bugs to @btaylor and @banga_shrey.
865254501107683328 2017-05-18 17:15:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry We need a deadpool Quip doc listing all old racist assholes who gave us Trump.
865253821760405504 2017-05-18 17:12:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jamespmanley I don't think I've ever seen Mitch McConnell in someone's cover photo
865250833239220224 2017-05-18 17:00:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ayyar That Roe v Wade was too early / super-polarizing
865250729593683968 2017-05-18 17:00:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> A tough choice is ++ better when there's latent popular bipartisan support - even if that means waiting & tolerating injustice while u wait
865249374896398336 2017-05-18 16:55:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> Reminds me of Ruth Bader Ginsberg's point about the timing Roe v Wade and SCOTUS's same sex marriage decisions
865249088731729920 2017-05-18 16:53:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> And I was 1 of many people upset he didn't act sooner. By waiting, he picked a moment when there was widespread, bipartisan national support
865247330802442240 2017-05-18 16:46:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> Rod Rosenstein appointed the special prosecutor at exactly the right time.
865229531610624000 2017-05-18 15:36:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> So great people are openly disparaging Roger Ailes today. We should have done this with Jesse Helms also, and Mitch McConnell in the future.
864996405802188800 2017-05-17 00:09:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EliotACohen @ColinKahl I want to RT this!
864987267151962113 2017-05-17 23:33:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo I'm joking / implying that Waymo will bleed Lyft for info/data and then compete against it
864941067732262912 2017-05-17 20:29:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> I wonder if Waymo will have a growth and learning mindset as Lyft's new strategic partner
864935883862024192 2017-05-17 20:09:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @_danilo Now we're talking. Reasonable people can figure this out.
864935717432049664 2017-05-17 20:08:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtreyens Hate the game not the players! I'm trying to get shit done.
864935396014120960 2017-05-17 20:07:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Is it crass to start discussing a tax-reform/impeachment package deal?
864902579213303808 2017-05-17 17:56:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @artypapers @yishan @joshelman No - just thought the transition was startling / maybe a wrench to Pinterest
864902055168581632 2017-05-17 17:54:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @artypapers @yishan @joshelman Do you think Pinterest will be able to fill the gap?
864711119096741888 2017-05-16 05:16:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @robennals OK to root against Trump now?

864697089120378880 2017-05-16 04:20:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac Does that person tweet what they have for breakfast
864671198696808448 2017-05-16 02:37:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz Yeah this is the problem - he's not thinking this through enough, not that he's actually a despicable person

864656452534665216 2017-05-16 01:38:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> Chaffetz opportunism is a sight to behold - like the end of the movie Ransom where the lead kidnapper decides to turn on his henchmen.https://twitter.com/nytnational/status/864654108090916864
864653933339213824 2017-05-16 01:28:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonlovett We need a rating system
864640784951164928 2017-05-16 00:36:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @meganromer Yes those are the words I was looking for
864640362383417344 2017-05-16 00:35:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> I wonder if the people who leaked to the NYTimes and Washington Post left out some good parts from the memos that will come out later
864639695757615104 2017-05-16 00:32:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Maybe Trump should have worked harder on an amicable separation with Comey
864638206016315392 2017-05-16 00:26:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @artypapers @yishan Well Biz certainly seems to want it, so that's one

864634542035841025 2017-05-16 00:11:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel I think Jason said what he said bc he wants to defend President under any circumstances & facts don't matter - but I could be wrong
864634148345925632 2017-05-16 00:10:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jw It's really hard for me to tell, especially while @eringriffith is also trying to tweet about startups
864633808187871233 2017-05-16 00:08:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> I can't tell from my Twitter feed whether Trump has undermined our strategic alliance with Turkey or Israel
864628076444925952 2017-05-16 23:46:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz John this isn't Michael Clayton. It's possible some of the players aren't thinking 10 chess moves out.
864627706188648448 2017-05-16 23:44:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> Kidding aside, I see this and think that Rs wouldn't mind Pence and are starting to think about ithttps://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/864627283700723716
864626922558341121 2017-05-16 23:41:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eringriffith Is it about Jelly
864625153635790848 2017-05-16 23:34:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eringriffith I raise this point because there's a lot going on now
864624839180419072 2017-05-16 23:33:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @yishan @artypapers you guys are fucking haters
864623663978430464 2017-05-16 23:28:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eringriffith this better be good
864621930086670338 2017-05-16 23:21:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Jason Chaffetz... (1) deciding not to run for reelection, (2) still being ambitious politically, & (3) being from Utah -> could be big dealhttps://twitter.com/jasoninthehouse/status/864616135466950656
864567573400010752 2017-05-16 19:45:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> This conclusion seems sensiblehttps://twitter.com/khanoisseur/status/864567348765831168

864563698110668800 2017-05-16 19:30:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricNewcomer My POV is shared by many folks on Twitter. If you don't get it, you're not listening / reading.
864563114435424256 2017-05-16 19:28:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricNewcomer I appreciate Maggie, not NYT overall. You don't seem to have much of an appreciation for why people like me despise the Times' leadership.
864554970447609856 2017-05-16 18:55:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> OK, I'm starting to understand how and why Maggie values access in the Trump Administration. This article is incredible.https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/864552647793266688

864239019445460992 2017-05-15 22:00:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @VZWSupport I just made change in Verizon store. You can find me easily in system. You've been overcharging me for years (?)
864235186854035456 2017-05-15 21:44:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @VZWSupport Ok here's a start: when you start to offer a cheaper rate for the same one I have now, how about automatically switching me to cheaper plan?
864231178139717632 2017-05-15 21:29:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @VZWSupport It is almost to know where to start/finish. Your stores are so slow and non-transparent.
864230679977926656 2017-05-15 21:27:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshuaforman Pray for change - http://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2017/4/21/15386854/apple-satellite-internet-boeing-alphabet-google-hires
864230110978686976 2017-05-15 21:24:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> I suspect people would buy significantly more data if it were marketed by someone other than Verizon and AT&T
864229909236862976 2017-05-15 21:24:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brad_wolff Meaning I want Apple to run the network service not just sell the phone
864229254472417280 2017-05-15 21:21:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Verizon's customer service and overall experience is so bad; it is shockingly awful compared to everything else about owning an iPhone.
864228175521370112 2017-05-15 21:17:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> If Apple could replace Verizon for end-to-end phone and data service that would be awesome

863046742702407680 2017-05-12 15:02:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> Important: we should have empathy for Trump's teamhttps://twitter.com/maggienyt/status/863035214188171264
863043002775646208 2017-05-12 14:47:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mcottle Right - who cares?
862887478482554880 2017-05-11 04:29:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @andersoncooper @ClaraJeffery You know not to watch Fox, but CNN is arguably worse because it purports to be legit
862887163553132544 2017-05-11 04:28:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @andersoncooper @ClaraJeffery You gotta stop watching CNN
862872305751310337 2017-05-11 03:29:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @_jeffguo we gotta stop talking about stuff that doesn't matter like bushes
862835739830112256 2017-05-11 01:04:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sknthla Maybe another problem is that the medium-sized department store model isn't appealing to consumers any more
862813143298228225 2017-05-11 23:34:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack This is insane
862808852948852737 2017-05-11 23:17:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mikememoli Who cares about this particular storyline? Does it really matter who in Trump's press shop is doing better/worse?
862808630587924481 2017-05-11 23:16:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricLiptonNYT I agree 100%. Will the NYT's coverage / headlines tomorrow reflect your DEFCON2 comment, or will it be sober and semi-balanced?
862795641537179648 2017-05-11 22:24:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jasonlk yeah that seems like a very confident, strong power move
862728227063685120 2017-05-11 17:56:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KFILE Well, Pence's assertion was ridiculous and inauthentic.

862546028184064000 2017-05-10 05:52:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @gregmaturin28 @MikeIsaac @chrisgeidner So as you see it what are possible WH motives for this leak? I'm totally confused
862544450345615360 2017-05-10 05:46:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @gregmaturin28 @MikeIsaac @chrisgeidner I still don't understand why
862544332934467588 2017-05-10 05:46:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @gregmaturin28 @MikeIsaac @chrisgeidner Why would a WH source falsely claim (anonymously or otherwise) that Rosenstein threatened to resign?
862543940733370368 2017-05-10 05:44:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @gregmaturin28 @MikeIsaac @chrisgeidner So you think Rosenstein *did* threaten to resign, or no?

862443414343761920 2017-05-10 23:05:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine @maxrogo Josh: this angle hasn't been discussed much in media. You seem to be the 1 guy who gets the growth dynamics here, so pls go figure this out
862440384663658496 2017-05-10 22:53:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine Do you think lack of adult (say, 30+ yrs old) interest in the product is part of the problem
862418400248647680 2017-05-10 21:25:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans I think Mark, Kevin, Chris are significantly more formidable product opponents than Terry Semel & team

861667038548250624 2017-05-08 19:40:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> Another UberEATS advantage: their drivers use Google Maps. The Postmates drivers get lost because they don't.

859853054438330369 2017-05-03 19:31:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> 8/ I don't see how any of the current pure-play restaurant delivery guys can wait it out until self-driving cars.
859845354618933248 2017-05-03 19:01:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Notable that much of the best tech industry content requires a subscription - @theinformation, @benthompson, @nytimestech, @PandoDaily
859825951122661376 2017-05-03 17:44:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> 7/But boy this will be a playing field for giants. Uber & Amazon seem well-positioned. /end
859825738282696704 2017-05-03 17:43:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> 6/And of course other big change will be self-driving cars, although those seem 2+ years off? The combo of these 2 changes might be great
859825412800626688 2017-05-03 17:42:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> 5/In that world, restaurants operate much more cheaply; they can afford to pay more for delivery; delivery is more efficient
859825219384467456 2017-05-03 17:41:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> 4/Maybe only way delivery works is if retail restaurants are replaced w/centralized delivery-only kitchens aggregated in non-retail areas
859824901154160640 2017-05-03 17:40:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> 3/Maybe they can generate $15 per delivery in fees, tips, and payment from the restaurant?
859824796908929024 2017-05-03 17:39:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> 2/A delivery person can't make more than 2 deliveries per hour under the current restaurant system
859824674804350976 2017-05-03 17:39:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> 1/ It's a mystery how food-delivery companies (DoorDash, Postmates) make profits

859814020588609536 2017-05-03 16:56:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @shreyes @benthompson @perlberg I have some friends that say that all ESPN-degradation outcomes are explained by your analysis, and that ESPN's left politics don't matter.
859813689800540160 2017-05-03 16:55:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> Absolutely insane editor-in-chief of NYTimes (Dean Baquet) hasn't resigned over this clusterfuck. Worst journo leadership in our lifetime.https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/859811544082853888
859811587317571584 2017-05-03 16:47:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @perlberg @jarroddicker @noahchestnut Wait I don't understand this - what's the rationale for News as you see it?
859810865788235776 2017-05-03 16:44:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack This sounds mean, but I can't remember seeing many interesting tweets from Boston Herald reporters, so I think Twitter will be ok
859808959623868417 2017-05-03 16:36:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @noahchestnut @jarroddicker I like BuzzFeed's serious reporting & unique focus - ie @perlberg's story on ESPN & politics. HuffPo & other opinion-ish blogs != substitute
859807425397891072 2017-05-03 16:30:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> Quote tweeting makes threading on Twitter totally confusing
859806631357370368 2017-05-03 16:27:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jarroddicker IMO BuzzFeed News is more original than Quartz, which I think is a good comparable
859805392599105536 2017-05-03 16:22:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jarroddicker Who would be a contender for the title re originality among major-ish publishers?
859805104592928768 2017-05-03 16:21:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @perlberg @benthompson what do you think about this? @shreyes and I were debating cause and effect and he cited your recent ESPN analysis
859802965900537856 2017-05-03 16:12:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> BuzzFeed News has maybe the most original perspective & focus of any major news outlethttps://twitter.com/perlberg/status/859442111237804032

859628438226948098 2017-05-02 04:39:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SpyTalker Reactionary, nativist, populist.
859626988964896768 2017-05-02 04:33:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshelman Totally agree. Battery life and stronger screens are the two things we need.
859625136428810240 2017-05-02 04:26:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> See @MLauer and @jimmyfallon - pay attention to @jimmykimmel. You don't have to be spineless, principle-less, Vichy profit-maximizers.
859624622756638724 2017-05-02 04:24:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NateSilver538 @bradsilverberg Yep. The role of misogyny here is really misunderstood/played down, because no one wants to acknowledge it.
859624163371339776 2017-05-02 04:22:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> To be clear, my impression is that Tim Cook is slowboating/stretching out changes to maximize revenues/profits.

859097326542966784 2017-05-01 17:28:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> Axios's home feed might be the best source of insights on news outside of Twitter. The Wash Post is great but its front page is static.

858419567521021952 2017-04-29 20:35:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> The problem is that the Times is a high-end CNN - trying to spray a bunch of fancy perspectives while not offending the powerful too much.

857713628736143360 2017-04-27 21:50:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> The Freedom Caucus & the Tuesday Group only care about 1 thing - keeping their jobs. Neither of them care about getting rid of ObamaCare.

854893369855582208 2017-04-19 03:03:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray Ossoff isn't a Bernie progressive obsessed with exactly the same agenda as Bernie
854892185111506944 2017-04-19 02:59:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @deray He's mad that hard-progressives aren't the nominees and that Democrats are pushing hard-progressives.

854815543013933057 2017-04-19 21:54:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> Another possibility is maybe Chaffetz thought he'd lose his next reelection (?) This WaPost story hints at that  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jason-chaffetz-announces-he-wont-run-for-office-in-2018/2017/04/19

854794417722408964 2017-04-19 20:30:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> Another interpretation is that the Russiagate investigation is turning up some serious shit and Chaffetz wants to distance himself from it

850079506203148288 2017-04-06 20:15:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> I wonder if this is a play for Secretary of State. Trump clearly doesn't want Romney in the Senate.https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/850054365243166720

850023650681954304 2017-04-06 16:33:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> They don't want "President Bannon started war" type conversations.
850023620449509378 2017-04-06 16:33:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> War w NKorea a huge possibility v soon, w pol benefits. Maybe Bannon was demoted from NSC to create better optics as US goes to war.
850019759458467845 2017-04-06 16:17:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @amlewis4 Basically. IOW Trump tapped & baited racist feelings much more aggressively and manipulatively than McCain and Romney (ie men of character)
850017069986832384 2017-04-06 16:07:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> My theory: all Trump actions are based on maximizing 2020 reelect. Zero principles other than Will to Power. Syria attack consistent w that.https://twitter.com/danabashcnn/status/850014923690319872

849326381280505856 2017-04-04 18:22:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RayThornson Interesting. Do many families you know use Snapchat this way?

849310538328924164 2017-04-04 17:19:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jcukier Maybe it's still useful while u are single/go out. Or maybe I'm wrong & millenials will keep using it as young parents like my gen loves FB

849303835755630593 2017-04-04 16:53:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ikirigin It's not clear to me that Snapchat has a path to adult mainstream usage.
849303665026498560 2017-04-04 16:52:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ikirigin Facebook's challenge is to stay relevant w young users and give people products they enjoy, taking advantage of FB's complete social graph
849302750190075904 2017-04-04 16:48:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ikirigin Mayb. But notable more adults don't use it now. My arg: value prop for adults isn't there. If I don't enjoy it, I won't push friends to use
849301334318776323 2017-04-04 16:43:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Facebook and Instagram work for ages 25-90. Snapchat seems uniquely awesome for HS/college when you are max-intense spending time w friends
849300116842348546 2017-04-04 16:38:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm trying to understand value of Snapchat to adults. I don't think there is 1 which is why - adults don't use it - Snap won't be $100B co

848995638209519616 2017-04-03 20:28:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> I want to emphasize that Oath sounds like something I do because I'm tempted to do something else
848994475040845824 2017-04-03 20:23:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> Gboard now offers fucking as a choicepic.twitter.com/WEObE9YSgS
848993359708381184 2017-04-03 20:19:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericries Nah. New Oath will have name recognition approaching zero
848988338052714496 2017-04-03 19:59:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joelcifer https://twitter.com/MarcBodnick/status/848980291460882432
848985144534814720 2017-04-03 19:46:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo IMO this isn't big opp. Twitter has already bled ++ elite writers who aren't journos or avid bloggers. Ppl willing to pay < than u think
848984005013782528 2017-04-03 19:42:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericries The problem is forceful, clueless clients + anyone who is good at naming wouldn't be a naming consultant.
848982328189702146 2017-04-03 19:35:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericries Ok touch that's a contender.  But Oath is still worse.
848981753209298944 2017-04-03 19:33:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Like one of the creepy Opus Dei scenes in The Da Vinci Code.
848981701170679808 2017-04-03 19:33:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> It makes me feel "to delete my Yahoo account I need to sign a blood oath" or something like that.
848980682462253058 2017-04-03 19:29:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> Even given that Verizon is the owner this is surprisingly terrible.
848980649063010304 2017-04-03 19:28:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> Is there a less fun word than Oath? It sounds like oaf, or maybe about religion or law enforcement.
848980291460882432 2017-04-03 19:27:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> This might be the worst consumer internet company name ever https://twitter.com/stevekovach/status/848978601626267648
848713485525540865 2017-04-02 01:47:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @OrinKerr That's because it's a ridiculous framework
848604626039349248 2017-04-02 18:34:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't think we should be joking about this
848604392781627392 2017-04-02 18:33:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> This isn't a question of taste. The guy is a misogynistic asshole who broke the law.

848558115876290560 2017-04-02 15:29:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo These photos are not normal!
848359682527731712 2017-04-01 02:21:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's remarkable how many resources Twitter has devoted to squeezing more content into a 140-character constraint.
848332516431847426 2017-04-01 00:33:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> That's not what @mcuban (a Trump opponent) is doing. He's guarding against too high expectations re Trump going down.https://twitter.com/alexandraerin/status/848327045641887744

847934835238748160 2017-03-31 22:13:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FoxBusiness @RepDaveBrat @TeamCavuto Great clip. What switch is he referring to at the end?
847931902157701120 2017-03-31 22:01:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pt That's true, but there is clearly reluctance to use the words lie, lying, liar. And I think most of Nunes' behavior is purposeful.
847919405065424896 2017-03-31 21:11:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't understand everyone characterizing Nunes as incompetent or bumbling. He's lying and he's a liar.https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/847899502396702725

847847020777754626 2017-03-31 16:24:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Twitter @dylanlscott In fairness, this is what change often feels like re consumer interactive products.
847838894867464192 2017-03-31 15:51:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> Who are major citizen journalists on Twitter besides @LouiseMensch @SethAbramson @alexandraerin? I'm writing a list for a question on Quora.
847827113461768194 2017-03-31 15:05:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JesseDorogusker Oh I think they can. Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper are good. Jeff Zucker is deliberately putting garbage on the air.
847824492759928832 2017-03-31 14:54:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaredkrouss Not sure that's right way to see it. Less focus on reductionist "2 sided balance" is what's needed. Try Morning Joe & you'll see what I mean
847824102396010497 2017-03-31 14:53:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Too much about CNN is about distribution of bullshit propaganda, rather than helping viewers understand the news better.
847823636652150784 2017-03-31 14:51:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> "Audience development" isn't the solution. Getting rid of stupid people on their panels would be a better start.
847823024698949633 2017-03-31 14:48:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> The problem is that CNN's product is crap. That's why they haven't built an addictive experience.https://twitter.com/niemanlab/status/847803167521751040

847675291895971841 2017-03-30 05:01:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @anildash The fact that it's a reply & who you're replying to is super important context, but it's minimized small and gray - crazy design decision
847675266235224067 2017-03-30 05:01:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @anildash To be clear - the visual design is super confusing.
847674805478240260 2017-03-30 04:59:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @anildash What, new users should be replying less than existing users? That seems like a nose dive trajectory.
847674671189196806 2017-03-30 04:59:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @anildash The problem isn't that it's bad for experienced users; the problem is that it's bad, period.
847674087082139651 2017-03-30 04:57:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @anildash This isn't a serious product suggestion (?)
847577889486667776 2017-03-30 22:34:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> Reagan would've been more aggressive than Ryan. He'd cut taxes 1st & build wall, then dare Congress not to close deficit by cutting h'care

847533241955303424 2017-03-30 19:37:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Facebook Live double screen is pretty insane. It's hard to think of a company as big as FB whose software products are improving like this.

847186745955188736 2017-03-29 20:40:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> They both seem smarter/as smart as anyone around Trump, except maybe McMaster and Mattis
847186608784789504 2017-03-29 20:40:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> I gotta say, of all the stuff to be angry about - Ivanka & Jared working for Trump doesn't bother me that muchhttps://twitter.com/nytimes/status/847185545155543040
847167386704728064 2017-03-29 19:23:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jason @AdamSinger I bet they buy it (cheaply) and don't ruin it
847166885632262144 2017-03-29 19:21:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jason @AdamSinger I bet they acquire SoundCloud some time in next 12-18 months
847166358127165440 2017-03-29 19:19:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jason @AdamSinger as cons I love Spotify. Has massively improved discovery. I'd like to see labels go away & Spotify pay artists directly
847163165997654016 2017-03-29 19:06:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jason @AdamSinger I like Spotify's chances at addressing its challenges more than I do SoundCloud's
847160428182458372 2017-03-29 18:56:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jason I will bet you $100 on which does a better job executing. You take @SIRIUSXM and I will take @Spotify. Circle back in 12 months.
847159508929433600 2017-03-29 18:52:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @voxdotcom @B_resnick I think this explanation is too charitable/empathetic
847158509355462656 2017-03-29 18:48:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jason I get your point about focus, but Spotify seems very well-positioned here
847150996249722880 2017-03-29 18:18:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshorton you mean the nuclear option re: Gorsuch? Why is that "blowing up the Senate for this president"? All GOP Sens want Gorsuch, no?
847111042207404033 2017-03-29 15:39:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mikeallen @danprimack great minds think alike. Seriously though I think Industry headwinds are not favorable
847110881393594369 2017-03-29 15:39:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mikeallen @danprimack notable there's no discussion re this super-interesting story. Is there a place where ppl are commenting/discussing?
847110220589363200 2017-03-29 15:36:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mikeallen @danprimack I predict BuzzFeed sells & the IPO prep is a precursor to that. At a minimum good chance there's a dual-track process

846414475951419392 2017-03-27 17:31:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry @benthompson would love to have coffee the next time you are in the states (although I imagine you are in super-high-demand)
846397401422184448 2017-03-27 16:24:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> Their intense focus and persistence is sorely missing from mainstream media, which always wants to Move On
846396952002478080 2017-03-27 16:22:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> They may make mistakes, although no more than traditional media outlets
846396791616561152 2017-03-27 16:21:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> We need people like @SethAbramson & @LouiseMensch because mainstream media isn't doing a good enough job

846183995356340224 2017-03-26 02:16:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rlove @maggieNYT Dean Baquet should be fired in light of what are learning post-election.
846182886554320896 2017-03-26 02:11:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rlove @maggieNYT NYT coverage of Hillary emails & Trump/Russia was an abomination - maybe the biggest journalistic failure in a generation
846090554119106560 2017-03-26 20:04:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marcushjohnson if we share their pain enough we can make them stop hating black people, Jews and women
846089276852912128 2017-03-26 19:59:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> Perhaps Trump's non-college white supporters are united by racism and misogyny https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/846087336232472578
846087890585104384 2017-03-26 19:54:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias could it be that many of them are racist misogynists?
846036890444742656 2017-03-26 16:31:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KaraCalavera huge mistake. RBG is genius
846036510746992641 2017-03-26 16:29:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom why do you hate comics
846035439697903616 2017-03-26 16:25:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> It doesn't do anyone good to focus on Pizzagate or various Infowars conspiracy theories that ~1/3 of Trump supporters subscribe to.
846034430858702849 2017-03-26 16:21:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's not OK to characterize Trump's core base of supporters as "dumb as a bag of hammers." That's not how we'll come together as a nation.
846032941629108225 2017-03-26 16:15:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshtpm His lessons would be (absent ideology): - Wrong Chief of Staff - Inexperienced senior staff - Too much deference to Ryan
846032580654784512 2017-03-26 16:14:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshtpm Dick Neustadt would have a field day
845856755204554753 2017-03-25 04:35:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @yashar the thing is, this criticism seems spot-on
845842705880002561 2017-03-25 03:39:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo I don't see how this doesn't blow up - super smart
845835809894756352 2017-03-25 03:12:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brad_wolff have you tried groups on WhatsApp?
845796789051539456 2017-03-25 00:37:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> Also you can tailor your message to different audiences. Pizzagate voters get one message, people who care about tax cuts get another.
845793147414204416 2017-03-25 00:22:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Not caring about telling the truth makes it easier to A/B test messaginghttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/845762493276475393
845771202798903296 2017-03-25 22:55:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PhilleoJ @BenedictEvans @whrobbins WhatsApp is a *much* better product than iMessage (I know this POV is not widely shared yet)
845767716401135616 2017-03-25 22:41:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davemorin @retornam Spotify, WhatsApp, Gmail, Dropbox are not niche products. Lots of people use them.
845759874814296064 2017-03-25 22:10:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PhilleoJ @BenedictEvans agree about photos, but iTunes and iMessage are super-painful and face very strong standalone competition
845735168174260224 2017-03-25 20:32:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Prediction: Gary Cohn will be chief of staff by end of Mayhttps://twitter.com/tarapalmeri/status/845696980416430080
845734365891969024 2017-03-25 20:29:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Another key point - for those of us on Gmail/GCalendar, you'd think Pixel/Android could become especially powerful/compellingly integrated
845733356125900800 2017-03-25 20:25:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidsirota Yeah crazy. As someone who reads NYT a lot and rarely watches Fox, I agree NYT (and others) have ignored/misunderstood Fox.
845732474621636608 2017-03-25 20:21:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> But maybe this is all wrong. Betting against Apple is always a mistake. Who knows what's coming - maybe iPhone X will re-extend ID gap.
845732220354551808 2017-03-25 20:20:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is consistent w/overall feeling "how can AAPL keep winning w/mediocre SW+services."
845731449143681024 2017-03-25 20:17:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> Apple's Industrial Design adv is meaningful, but maybe Pixel is showing that: (1) ID is becoming less important & (2) Google is closing gap?
845731207748902912 2017-03-25 20:16:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> iPhone has less of a hold on me if all my services are iOS-independent.

842616316653588480 2017-03-16 05:59:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> Algo stories in feed (eg ppl you follow liked this, while you were away) make Twitter even more politics-heavy. Can't get away from politics

842052406099623936 2017-03-15 16:38:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @btaylor for worksheets it would be great if the title was more prominent, like in docs
841886027581124608 2017-03-14 05:37:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Baoke haha - so true. good point.
841884402984603648 2017-03-14 05:30:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @arthur_affect Sure but people liked him immediately, even when he was a jerk. Opening 20 minutes of Iron Man was iconic business mogul cool
841883888314142720 2017-03-14 05:28:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @arthur_affect More so than now, no? Tony Stark's arc coincided with the Obama admin. Business & tech folks often romanticized during 08-16.
841880941593260032 2017-03-14 05:17:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @garrytan The problem w/themes is that only 1 or 2 companies win in many categories, so "right company" = more important than "right theme"
841880738626703361 2017-03-14 05:16:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @garrytan What marketplaces have been super-successful besides Airbnb and Uber? Seems like "marketplaces" was a major VC theme for a while.
841857597485461504 2017-03-14 03:44:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marcushjohnson need for even-ness also means loudly calling victory for Trump sometimes. I suspect many CNN viewers= older, pro-Trump folks
841856251071946753 2017-03-14 03:39:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marcushjohnson It's CNN. They need to keep it as even as is plausible.
841756018967158785 2017-03-14 21:00:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PinterestEng @matijagrcic @dkislyuk congrats. the product is sweet.
841752781388050432 2017-03-14 20:47:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin I hear you. It's rly more of a blog post (she cross-posted to Medium). It's the best exposition I've seen re the Bernie/HRC divide
841749931173990400 2017-03-14 20:36:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> This thread on Democratic party politics is really goodhttps://twitter.com/SallyAlbright/status/841347273145511937
841749153600360448 2017-03-14 20:33:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> I hadn't realized how many smart people agreed that Chris Cillizza was the worst thing about the Washington Postpic.twitter.com/9pnwZ9jkTn
841719257297707008 2017-03-14 18:34:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin Yeah I would not want to be Bose.
841718885745225732 2017-03-14 18:33:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Because bad bluetooth integration (btwn car & phone; headphone & phone) is 1 of biggest frustration friction pts today in portable media
841718426317996032 2017-03-14 18:31:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Semi-related note: I bet Apple's work to make bluetooth integration work better among its own products will be a massive advantage over time
841717834119970816 2017-03-14 18:29:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> As a customer, I'd rather all my iPhone-related hard stuff be made by Apple, so that they'll defend it when I come into the store
841717610211241986 2017-03-14 18:28:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> Adverse bias problem is brutal. If the category turns out to be meh, Apple won't enter. If the category is super-profitable, Apple enters.
841717465046437888 2017-03-14 18:27:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> I wouldn't want to be making 3rd party plastic accessories or audio products that are tightly integrated to iPhones
841717087722651648 2017-03-14 18:26:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> If a product is sold through Apple stores, it's really vulnerable to Apple launching a competing product
841420062779105280 2017-03-13 22:45:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> It really feels like Paul Ryan is being set up to take the fallhttps://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/841416447494508544
841413230610202626 2017-03-13 22:18:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @StuPolitics I thought dumb panelists & TV news were like milk & cookies but I'm always surprised how thoughtful Morning Joe's guests are
841412597891006464 2017-03-13 22:16:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @StuPolitics Is CNN putting dumb people on the air again?
841410556665905153 2017-03-13 22:08:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> Spotify seems to have the big advantage here - learning about what you like, getting good at discovery
841409802588712960 2017-03-13 22:05:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> Drivetime is such a huge media opp - unavailable to most smartphone apps that depend on looking
841409303143620608 2017-03-13 22:03:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> Traditional radio really is doomed. The reckoning has been delayed by slow smartphone/car integration, but it will be brutal
841405159389380608 2017-03-13 21:46:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JasonHirschhorn Yeah I don't know. The GOP House majority is so odious it's hard to know what to root for.
841404555678035968 2017-03-13 21:44:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> most interesting tweet I've seen todayhttps://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/841399030903164929
841395479023767552 2017-03-13 21:08:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @whrobbins yeah iOS has strong distribution advantages, just like Apple Maps and Music. But WhatsApp's product gap is massive & widening.
841387940907376640 2017-03-13 20:38:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> The people who run iMessage must not use WhatsApp. It's staggering how much better WhatsApp is for groups.
841381646397931520 2017-03-13 20:13:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> Strong liquidity - Quora Q&A getting good fast: Is Zelda: Breath of the Wild good 4 ppl who have never played Zelda?https://www.quora.com/Is-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-good-for-people-who-have-never-played-Zelda-and-for-kids-Or-is-it-too-sophisticated?srid=pg
841380205755215873 2017-03-13 20:07:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> Or when Darrell Issa calls for a Special Prosecutor, knowing that everyone else can ignore him
841377554401443840 2017-03-13 19:56:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Similar to when GOP tacitly OKs certain Reps to oppose toxic bill or appointee when GOP knows it already has 50+% of the votes
841377137282105345 2017-03-13 19:55:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> GOP Congressmen calling out King is just fake political theater. All Republicans reap political benefits from this racism.https://twitter.com/scottwongDC/status/841376522804088838
841369656812224513 2017-03-13 19:25:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> So there's your explanation for how all this works.

841321747790020608 2017-03-13 16:15:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy it's really good. Relatively undiscovered on the West Coast but a real gem
841321050059108352 2017-03-13 16:12:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy have you watched Morning Joe? You gotta record it (3-5am PT). Just watch first 20 mins of each show. Freshest news analysis anywhere
841320410067095552 2017-03-13 16:09:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy but if you record the night before morning listeners will get maximum value during the most convenient time to listen
841319418508455936 2017-03-13 16:05:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonlovett @ywxwy why impossible? Record the night before.
841317104695488512 2017-03-13 15:56:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> Interesting threadhttps://twitter.com/douthatnyt/status/841311399217377280
841314870041567232 2017-03-13 15:47:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> Pod Saves America is good but they shud record Mon podcast Sun night so we can listen during Mon drivetime. There's a staleness problem nowhttps://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/838862289176416256
841301350478577664 2017-03-13 14:54:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @noahchestnut yeah but even news analysis gets stale quick. I think this is a real LT problem for the category.
841299590678700034 2017-03-13 14:47:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> Live and near-live seems like the future of news. If you are focused on breaking events - reuse doesn't work that well.
841299207491219456 2017-03-13 14:45:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> By contrast - news-driven podcasts often feel stale. By the time they are posted and I listen to them, their topic and content is old news.
841298739876716544 2017-03-13 14:43:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> 1 reason Morning Joe's so good: it's totally fresh - at 6am it covers events from last night & precedes all the action on Twitter in the AM
841069192019234817 2017-03-12 23:31:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> What a joke. @PostBaron and the Washington Post are crushing the Times. Baquet is a terrible lead editor.https://twitter.com/carolynryan/status/840989785611091968

841002411581878272 2017-03-12 19:06:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> All autocorrects make this mistake - frustrating
841002304841035777 2017-03-12 19:05:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> When autocorrect fixes word after I type a space, if I delete the space (eg to go back/add punctuation) I don't want to lose autocorrection!
840647794188734464 2017-03-11 19:37:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JDVance1 @JYSexton High incentive to rationalize if actual views are racist
840647766590205952 2017-03-11 19:37:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JDVance1 @JYSexton expressing views that are max empathy-eliciting = authentic *or* rationalizing.
840647011980345344 2017-03-11 19:34:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JDVance1 @JYSexton yeah idea ppl will openly express racist or misogynist views when asked is obv wishful thinking - problem w/interviews
840339869171773440 2017-03-10 23:13:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang full disclosure- I was making a joke. All products degrade under Microsoft ownership.
840335576788217860 2017-03-10 22:56:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang don't have a strong view.

840230366854111234 2017-03-10 15:58:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BradStone @EricNewcomer not sarcasm. Why do you think podcasts are so in vogue now? And you agree it's hit a turn in the last 6-12 months?

838534362459054080 2017-03-05 23:39:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rumpfshaker @bethanyshondark we we need *more* conservatives who are sanctimonious, given how few there are who care about principles
838091585715761155 2017-03-04 18:19:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> Access to the leakers seems more valuable than access to the White House. This explains why journalists are suddenly doing a good job.
838089145046093824 2017-03-04 18:09:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> The word "radio" in a Twitter author's bio significantly increases the likelihood that they are not intelligent

837531697491009536 2017-03-02 05:14:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom what if he spoke to them while in Beast Mode
837459805417529349 2017-03-02 00:29:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AaronBlake this is a great analysis
837455191980949504 2017-03-02 00:10:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bgurley I hope it wasn't a mistake that I downloaded 20 or 30 Amino apps on my phone
837453943714164737 2017-03-02 00:05:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @whrobbins yeah the Waymo fight may paralyze Uber SDC efforts
837452090578345985 2017-03-02 23:58:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr @AdamLipman1 right, but w/GOP's head in the sand, the only way 2 get independent investig is to pound table over & over & over & over
837451288711327744 2017-03-02 23:55:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> I didn't think cool music festivals threatened deportationhttps://twitter.com/GideonResnick/status/837406280914460673
837447786488438784 2017-03-02 23:41:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang fewer drivers, expensive surge, wonky app
837446268892807169 2017-03-02 23:35:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Uber is going to come out of all of this just fine. Lyft just isn't good enough.
837443402161508353 2017-03-02 23:24:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr I'm one of the people you think is brain-locked and partisan 
837442169803689984 2017-03-02 23:19:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr omg Russia != Whitewater. Russia is Watergate, foreign treason edition. Sounds like you don't agree.
837441719734005761 2017-03-02 23:17:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr IMO Russia is #1 issue & efforts to play down its importance should be ignored. This is esp true given GOP reluctance to investigate
837440540908015616 2017-03-02 23:12:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr this guy is pro-Trump/pro-Russia. He's considered a joke
837429918023606273 2017-03-02 22:30:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Diane Feinstein seems worthlesshttps://twitter.com/deirdrewalshcnn/status/837428936309096448
837428539821592580 2017-03-02 22:24:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> Republican Congressmen are really something. Orientals?https://twitter.com/zaidjilani/status/837418987583651841
837427954422439937 2017-03-02 22:22:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> The constant autocorrect of fucking to ducking makes me wonder whether Apple folks use their product. Autocorrect is generally terrible.
837426508931059713 2017-03-02 22:16:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @imillhiser @shane_bauer readers were led to believe that Hillary's emails revealed criminal behavior and lies on par with Trump's.
837425428264439808 2017-03-02 22:12:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @imillhiser @shane_bauer Inflammatory coverage, lack of context/analysis/assessment-of-importance, lack of context vs Trump - that's failure
837418551359107072 2017-03-02 21:45:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans @maxrogo that doesn't necessarily mean anything. adults didn't want to try FB, Instagram, WhatsApp.
837418057576267776 2017-03-02 21:43:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @louisgray so true
837417721922924544 2017-03-02 21:41:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO can I get you calling me an idiot on record? I collect this kind of thing. Just a simple tweet saying I'm an idiot will do. Thanks
837417201967640576 2017-03-02 21:39:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans Somewhat depends on how good your taste is. The question of Snapchat's adult opportunity is generally pretty key.
837415705326694400 2017-03-02 21:33:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bzamayo 23 for sure, maybe as low as 22?
837413783551139840 2017-03-02 21:26:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GlennThrush But then his staff didn't correct subsequently, right?

837377099446931456 2017-03-02 19:00:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro I think this Maxine Waters calling herself a millennial thing might have legs
837375091872690176 2017-03-02 18:52:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @drewdil yeah you could make a movie like that about watching CNN
837373998736384000 2017-03-02 18:48:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu question - can I start referring to CNN's panels as "moron-panels"? I'm looking for an efficient, authentic label
837373243212193792 2017-03-02 18:45:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac you've really gotten to the bottom of this strategy
837372985887465472 2017-03-02 18:44:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Watching @Morning_Joe+@CNN side-by-side: - Morning Joe adds to what I've learned on Twitter - CNN nonstop moron-panels add 0 to my knowledge
837346361385242624 2017-03-02 16:58:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> C'mon @JoeNBC you gotta lead with the Sessions stuff. @morningmika was right. Boring opening 90 seconds.
837340652560003072 2017-03-02 16:35:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> Let's remember: Joe Manchin voted to confirm Sessionshttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/837337968352325632
837335001993629696 2017-03-02 16:13:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO @baseballcrank you guys are cucks
837203255985778688 2017-03-01 07:29:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> Are we done? Is that it? No more news tonight? I'm still up for another Sessions story if anyone is close to publishing.
837200253992361988 2017-03-01 07:17:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @McFaul Mike - have you posted your thoughts on the Sessions situation?
837193708231544833 2017-03-01 06:51:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr @semil But god bless replacing Flynn with McMaster! Fabulous. My children's life expectancy went up 3%.
837193493592195072 2017-03-01 06:50:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr @semil Agitating 4 quick results != helpful re investigations. Look @ Rs 4 inspiration: they're patient/let investigations take course
837192943500836864 2017-03-01 06:48:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr @semil Flynn was #1 FP advisor to WH & arguably the 3rd most dangerous man in world. Huge victory.
837191903816773632 2017-03-01 06:44:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr @semil First blood was Mike Flynn. I'm optimistic.
837191163819937792 2017-03-01 06:41:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr @semil I disagree w/u guys. With Dems in minority, they're doing what they have to do re Russia. Lots of guerilla exploration is good
837190224656543744 2017-03-01 06:37:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pt goddammit Parker your reasonableness is driving me crazy
837189350513233920 2017-03-01 06:34:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin all the lying and perjury stuff is just bad marketing; last night showed that the core product is still great
837188974330290177 2017-03-01 06:33:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pt #TeamGeraldo is in the stone age! Hannity's the stupidest & most dangerous guy on Fox; anyone who says otherwise has head up their ass
837188232508944385 2017-03-01 06:30:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin I agree - so many great ideas and a unifying tone. I can't wait to see what the next week or two brings.
837188025377406977 2017-03-01 06:29:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pt It's more fun to say we are disagreeing.
837187569854996480 2017-03-01 06:27:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pt I guess reasonable people can disagree about who is the worse cancer on our republic. I bleed #TeamHannity.
837187267009490944 2017-03-01 06:26:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> I can really feel the administration resetting -- pivoting into a new era of winning and getting things done.
837186944580767744 2017-03-01 06:24:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pt Worse than Hannity?
837185735052546049 2017-03-01 06:20:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pt he doesn't seem worse to me than various other programming leads
837185074399358976 2017-03-01 06:17:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion yeah this seems like it will be a huge problem for her
837181360267657216 2017-03-01 06:02:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> The truth? Zucker = #1 media CEO who made huge profits normalizing Trump. History books should memorialize Zucker as chief enabler of evilhttps://twitter.com/THR/status/837180712084193280
837176981703663617 2017-03-01 05:45:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HeerJeet madame bovary guy

837171983628414976 2017-03-01 05:25:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @byjoelanderson it's really just one friend right
837171627884367873 2017-03-01 05:24:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @zthomas_nc this joke doesn't really work
837171549043974144 2017-03-01 05:23:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @zthomas_nc I'm joking
837171382068772864 2017-03-01 05:23:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> Joe Manchin's staff must be intensely sorting thru complex details of the Sessions perjury crisis. Manchin won't rest until justice is done.
837165875115413507 2017-03-01 05:01:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @amyjrosenberg I swear I'm joking! I thought it would be fun to post this into the shitstorm of Sessions tweets drowning my timeline now
837165402627067904 2017-03-01 04:59:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Maybe it's late to say this, but I thought last night Trump spoke more eloquently than I expected!
837161574934556672 2017-03-01 04:44:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy better to watch full first 20 mins

837160458205323264 2017-03-01 04:39:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy it's 3-6am PT. Record it and just watch the first 20 mins (until first ad break). It's really good.
837160025323888640 2017-03-01 04:37:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> .@Morning_Joe is going to be awesome tomorrow morning. What a world where so much news happens after 7pm PT.
837159031584124928 2017-03-01 04:34:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't see how you can compete with pure Twitter, Washington Post, NYTimes if you are this slow
837158930547560449 2017-03-01 04:33:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> Politico still doesn't have Sessions story on front page (8:33pm PT)pic.twitter.com/nQN085xqi1
837151194887794688 2017-03-01 04:02:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Phil_Mattingly What's the response to DOJ's point that he was acting as a Senator?
837092800529326084 2017-03-01 00:10:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol @David_Feldman_ But Iraq War!
836997465324691456 2017-03-01 17:52:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi disagree - nothing wrong with pushing edge on stylish ID
836995906356432896 2017-03-01 17:45:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @devnag I agree. But beyond that he comes off as v smart/authentic. On Twitter he reminds me of @Evan_McMullin - gold standard for no BS
836994461250932736 2017-03-01 17:40:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> This guy seems like the most promising young Democratic leaderhttps://twitter.com/jasonkander/status/836987401667022849
836831706602680322 2017-02-28 06:53:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @yottapoint I think CNN in its heart wants the guy normalized + normal access for CNN
836817428013264897 2017-02-28 05:56:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ktumulty Love the post but can we stop talking about the new slogan? Sorta trivializing.
836784210568482824 2017-02-28 03:44:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias I like her a lot more because of her tweets this year
836784063268581376 2017-02-28 03:44:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias We need every high profile non-combatant available to un-normalize this administration
836784014966964224 2017-02-28 03:43:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias Disagree. She is smart, passionate, authentic, + courageous to challenge Trump directly.

836719844019953664 2017-02-28 23:28:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nadsinger @danprimack a lot of people like me think that local news is boring. (Don't hate me for saying this.)
836719555451867136 2017-02-28 23:27:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nadsinger @danprimack I suspect quite a few early adopters don't care about local news.

836695061370818560 2017-02-28 21:50:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro how about instead we all focus on opioid abuse
836694237290717184 2017-02-28 21:47:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> Not mystery why Examiner & Trump are focused on this - Rs thrived in 2016 by exploiting Bernie-Hillary conflict & alienating Bernie votershttps://twitter.com/freddoso/status/836692742814064640
836693640214765568 2017-02-28 21:44:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @adamdangelo And also, you only have one childhood to gamble with. So people are (understandably) risk-averse.
836689219598745600 2017-02-28 21:27:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoeNBC the show is too important to be hoarded by cosmopolitan elitists in New York and Washington.
836686880724807680 2017-02-28 21:17:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ignores creative destruction nature of pvt enterprise. Like looking@ 1000 e-commerce co's from late 90s & concluding e-commerce doesn't workhttps://twitter.com/EconomicPolicy/status/836674759429607425

836462379604963330 2017-02-27 06:25:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Wow NYTimes could've used this graph when assessing how to cover Trump and Hillary scandals during the election cc @deanbaquet @amychozickhttps://twitter.com/UpshotNYT/status/836461698617851905
836460064403677185 2017-02-27 06:16:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Cool picture. Congrats NYTimes: by persuading ppl that Hillary's emails were such a big deal, you ensured they wouldn't be on the 2017 graphhttps://twitter.com/nytimes/status/836425976246648838

836457269516615680 2017-02-27 06:05:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytimes @sean_a_rose @kaz the New York Times did a great job creating a huge new box during 3Q/4Q -- Hillary's emails.
836456852284043264 2017-02-27 06:03:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleyfeinberg We should be embracing W and help him make this transition, not attacking him
836456817903321088 2017-02-27 06:03:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleyfeinberg I don't understand. Seems to me a much bigger risk to not embrace allies who could beat Trump in what will be a tough battle
836455952576479233 2017-02-27 06:00:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> Plus George W. Bush and his familyhttps://twitter.com/MarcBodnick/status/835210477420490752
836455600804380673 2017-02-27 05:58:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleyfeinberg The upside is that we make allies and friends. Seriously, we can't fight with everyone.
836454394300260354 2017-02-27 05:54:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ashleyfeinberg eh, I think we gotta create a tent here that welcomes fellow combatants. I don't see the upside in poking W.

836360681217634308 2017-02-27 23:41:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo a big reason the show was bad was that it was so off key. Kimmel is partly responsible

836123703687589888 2017-02-27 08:00:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @yashar @LibyaLiberty one reason that's true is that Moonlight is clearly the better, more important movie
836110586932973569 2017-02-26 07:07:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hrana Warren Beatty is one of the most successful actors ever
836108263909314560 2017-02-26 06:58:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jamesrbuk @DPJHodges because: 1. He knew he has the wrong envelope 2. He let Faye Dunaway call out La La Land anyway
836107845439385602 2017-02-26 06:56:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sriramk I bet if it were you up there (or one of many other high performers) this wouldn't have been the outcome
836106956284686336 2017-02-26 06:53:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kimmasters I'm not a professional actor. But yeah, if I saw that the card was for Leading Actress I could have done better.
836106651174223873 2017-02-26 06:52:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sriramk He could have stopped the train himself. Not the end of the world, but no one forced him to this outcome. He shares the blame.
836105527243358208 2017-02-26 06:47:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> No surprise -- Michael Moore doesn't want to hold accountable an older white man who has made a mistakehttps://twitter.com/mmflint/status/836102972241293312
836102775276654595 2017-02-26 06:36:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> Quora's Chief Topic Officer says this was a prank.

836047912626900992 2017-02-26 02:58:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @justindross yeah I think I'm wrong - maybe it's better to not let Trump corrupt this

835980257857449986 2017-02-26 22:29:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac @sean_a_rose @adamnash $20mm to Hugh Jackman + likely financial success of N+1th Wolverine movie makes finality unlikely
835979787176857604 2017-02-26 22:28:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac @sean_a_rose rotten tomatoes is pretty unreliable these days, esp for big studio commercial priorities

835365439827910656 2017-02-24 05:46:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr It's such a bad issue for the media and Trump opponents. I've said before - feels like booing VP Pence at Hamilton.
835358842703663104 2017-02-24 05:20:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> We gotta stop talking about thishttps://twitter.com/politico/status/835358674340229120
835358595633983488 2017-02-24 05:19:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu your analysis is really good; you are generally best media analyst on Twitter but I esp appreciate the single article analyses

835356359440777217 2017-02-24 05:10:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac @rfradin the first two Wolverine movies were very forgettable. The second one is a Japanese travel ad.

835296042572636160 2017-02-24 01:11:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ayiyi nobody cares about the White House Correspondents Dinner. This feels like the Pence getting booed at Hamilton story.https://twitter.com/mmpadellan/status/835259305439997954
835294795606040576 2017-02-24 01:06:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Despite a # of different efforts, I haven't seen compelling evidence users *want* businesses to text them. Temptation to spam is too high.https://twitter.com/Recode/status/835294492492251136
835280244751790080 2017-02-24 00:08:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @adamnash There is insufficient skepticism in people who do Trump voter interviews. Taking people at their word isn't rational.
835277064273977348 2017-02-24 23:55:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> "I like the candidate who validates my feeling that others are to blame for my problems. It may not be right but it feels good."
835276406493872134 2017-02-24 23:53:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> "Honestly I'd prefer a white president than a woman, esp after 8 yrs of a black man" - things you won't hear from politics user research
835275035128430592 2017-02-24 23:47:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> We don't necessarily believe what ppl say in interviews abt product use - why do we think they're honest abt why they voted for a candidate?
835255732140322816 2017-02-24 22:30:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baseballcrank so you think a meaningful % of the protesters were paid? Say > 1%?
835255143704621058 2017-02-24 22:28:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FrankLuntz do the other 30% have a firm view?
835253993316081666 2017-02-24 22:24:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @agolis ah, interesting. As a reader I often find the conversations interesting
835252485178548224 2017-02-24 22:18:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @agolis why hate?
835250578133438464 2017-02-24 22:10:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @agolis but it's increasingly what Twitter is because the value proposition for professional writers is really clear/good

835202391934840833 2017-02-24 18:59:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> If this is true it may be possible to both beat Trump and not talk to birthers
835198874633433088 2017-02-24 18:45:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> The right coalition to beat Trump may be: professional Republicans + libertarians + young religious people+ the Lefthttps://twitter.com/anneapplebaum/status/835021485374914561
835170803473760257 2017-02-24 16:53:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi yep. The hard question which this Verge post wants to avoid is that should/can/will Twitter ban him for non-massive violation
835170336949743617 2017-02-24 16:51:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi otherwise how do you moderate reliably/efficiently/transparently?
835170197346516992 2017-02-24 16:51:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi yeah I don't understand idea of banning him "just bc it's good" vs a policy violation. Bans (& moderation) must be rooted in policy
835166313572020225 2017-02-24 16:35:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman @NickRiccardi yeah exactly. Any notion of rough equivalence is crazy.
835016607629885441 2017-02-23 06:40:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy Many DT voters aren't interested in truth. That's the target audience (~25-40% of his base) for lies abt voter fraud, birtherism, etc
835015386059821056 2017-02-23 06:35:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's clear what Bannon would be advising if the roles were reversed -- obstructing 100%
835012904554373120 2017-02-23 06:26:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @erinscafe got it. Fwiw some people think this Twitter's best new feature over the past year or so.
835011616240345088 2017-02-23 06:20:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @erinscafe I think this feature is pretty good for when I haven't checked Twitter in a while - you don't agree?
835011046100258816 2017-02-23 06:18:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> Many Trump voters seem immune to factshttps://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/835010117582139394

834977375041413120 2017-02-23 04:04:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jason_pontin @m2jr Trump is not relevant to your original tweet?https://twitter.com/m2jr/status/834962414231642112
834976325504921602 2017-02-23 04:00:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jason_pontin @m2jr if you posit that Trump is a terrible, catastrophic choice, then 3/4 is too low
834899027720196096 2017-02-23 22:53:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Curious what people who preach normalization, empathy, and compromise think about this threadhttps://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/834846243599826947
834890520451133440 2017-02-23 22:19:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin dunno. It's nuts.
834890442378354688 2017-02-23 22:19:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> WhatsApp is so much better - completely seamless to transition mid-conversation
834890201881182209 2017-02-23 22:18:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's shocking how bad iMessage desktop integrates with mobile - messages not in order, which makes it pretty unusable
834887568177016832 2017-02-23 22:08:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JDVance1 that's clearly not our current administration
834885725988388864 2017-02-23 22:00:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> A lot of business-minded Democrats want to sweep the transgender issue under the table, bc it highlights the hatefulness of the other side.

834834440727601153 2017-02-23 18:36:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mazhxri I don't get it
834833860554665984 2017-02-23 18:34:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @casey__allen yeah great question. I don't see easy fix; to be clear what I'm saying is that perpetrators of this scam don't want to fix it
834830923287834624 2017-02-23 18:22:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> In defending trans rights it should be enough to protect this group of vulnerable ppl, but as bonus you also get to combat misogyny & racism
834830109940944896 2017-02-23 18:19:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> People who attack trans rights are disproportionately likely to troll African-Americans, Jews, etc. Not a happy point to make but def true.
834829766083563520 2017-02-23 18:18:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> Defending trans rights and fighting with bigots who oppose them is the tip of the spear across all of these issues
834829580686938112 2017-02-23 18:17:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> People who attack trans rights usually also attack the rights of others. But they perceive that it's safer/more palatable to attack trans.
834829314310840320 2017-02-23 18:16:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trans rights=human rights. Running community at Quora I learned that trans rights = critical to protecting all rights - women's rights, LBGThttps://twitter.com/kumailn/status/834811055456923648
834827244765736960 2017-02-23 18:08:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AaronBlake This is really good - thanks for writing it
834825611684114433 2017-02-23 18:01:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> To state the obvious, virtually no one saw this retraction vs original RT. Sinister disinformation dynamic of rumor-spreading like this.https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/834816739636609024

834808532109176832 2017-02-23 16:53:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @ThePlumLineGS that's not to say that trad conservatives like them of course, but they benefit politically from their support
834808124708048896 2017-02-23 16:52:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @ThePlumLineGS My impression is Spencer/Duke are liked by some meaningful % of Trump base- no? Otherwise why not condemn them
834669010381705216 2017-02-22 07:39:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> You get the feeling Bernie wants to run in 2020https://twitter.com/sensanders/status/834443895266226176
834668602229813248 2017-02-22 07:37:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr OK we will agree to disagree. Your POV is certainly kinder and more empathetic toward Trump supporters.
834668016893730816 2017-02-22 07:35:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr yeah but I'm addressing your point that "it's easy to point to extemes." These aren't extremes; they are mainstream Trump base views
834667330437160960 2017-02-22 07:32:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr given data I don't think I'm doing that. Sig % of DT supporters r intolerant of Muslims, immigs, LBGT. Say 25+% in each bucket. No?
834666169789358082 2017-02-22 07:28:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr agree with that
834665987685244928 2017-02-22 07:27:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr Mike 43% of Trump supporters think Obama is Muslim. And v few support LBGT/transgender rights. So it's not "most," but it's a lot.
834665426734833665 2017-02-22 07:25:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr I respect your POV & agree there is strong intolerance/rigidity in SV, but don't agree w the equivalence/comparison you are asserting
834664235699277824 2017-02-22 07:20:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr gotcha. From my POV I don't find SV intolerance comparable to the toxic racist birtherism that plagued the Obama administration

834652378930388992 2017-02-22 06:33:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @m2jr SV intolerance re GWB was worse than AR/OK intolerance toward Obama? I don't remember Bush-era analogues like:https://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/takingnote/2015/09/14/facts-figures-43-percent-of-republicans-think-obama-is-muslim
834641149813874688 2017-02-22 05:48:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @saletan ayiyi this post=apologia for DT anti-semitism. Many writers seem unaware of anti-semitic forces backing DT & how he encourages them
834585929582944256 2017-02-22 02:09:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @yoda I guess from my POV I can find the channel quickly. I can't imagine a better experience with xfinity involved
834584077638307841 2017-02-22 02:02:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @yoda Twitter is pretty close to that now
834572410103832576 2017-02-22 01:15:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry Would have implicitly undermined my point, which is that they've made a typical mistake, not that they are fucking stupid.
834572334723788800 2017-02-22 01:15:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry I couldn't have people think Maple Media picked a sneezing elephant as logo.
834571718173679616 2017-02-22 01:12:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry I don't think that's sneezing. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R59byqo8DN4 for context.
834571023911563264 2017-02-22 01:10:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Roll-up strategies like this often sound good, but I can't think of one that has worked. I guess arguably IAC has had some success.https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/834570705077358592
834567223733690368 2017-02-22 00:55:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo As of right now that really doesn't seem likely. But a lot depends on (1) how bad things get with Trump, (2) who Dems pick in 2020
834565705085251585 2017-02-22 00:49:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> I assume most Trump voters oppose transgender rights? If we listen to them with love in our heart, can we change their minds?https://twitter.com/braddjaffy/status/834420050748641281

834555665846710272 2017-02-22 00:09:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo keys issues are immigration, abortion, taxes, Obamacare. It's hard to see middle ground, except maybe on infrastructure?
834555018594263041 2017-02-22 00:06:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @paulg @RaynorLaw exactly
834554961174204416 2017-02-22 00:06:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @paulg I'm curious what compromise ideas are  out there. The expressed policy preferences of Trump voters seem v intolerant/not thoughtful
834554618604515328 2017-02-22 00:05:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @paulg Nope. I'm open to it. But from what I've read I don't see common ground on issues they care abt - immigration, abortion, guns, crime
834553756037443584 2017-02-22 00:01:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think it's great to build bridges w those in the GOP who believe in kindness and compromise - but not w people who think Obama is a Muslim
834552029397725184 2017-02-22 23:54:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> Proponents of white empathy are trying to badger us into excusing intolerance & racism of Trump voters bc many of them are not bright & poor
834550175213293570 2017-02-22 23:47:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> These Sam Altman interviews are interesting, but idea that these voters feel demonized vs how POC, immigrants, women feel - ridiculoushttps://twitter.com/paulg/status/834114555781464064
834548479829516289 2017-02-22 23:40:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidfickling It could be because investors think Tesla will be bigger and more profitable than Nissan in the future
834535889556508672 2017-02-22 22:50:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BensOscarMath hey you should host a @QuoraSessions. cc @nadsinger
834535579178016768 2017-02-22 22:49:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricBoehlert @jcpolls Yeah sorry I misspoke. What I mean to say is that the NBC/SM disapproval rating = 43% while Quinnipiac is 38%.
834521051040141312 2017-02-22 21:51:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricBoehlert Is this the right poll to look at? Morning Joe featured NBC/SurveyMonkey poll this AM that says unfav # is 43%. cc @jcpolls
834506981083721728 2017-02-22 20:55:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sarahcuda Necessary albeit not sufficient: hardware products must have intelligence that really matters, or they'll get commoditized
834480817489338369 2017-02-22 19:11:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pierre I'd guess he resigns in ~1yr. Has no power + no previous DT relationship. Hard to exert influence w/Mattis+Kelly+McMaster+Bannon

834474159958683648 2017-02-22 18:45:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheMattWilstein I don't understand; I like Morning Joe and the guests seem good. No?
834467840430206976 2017-02-22 18:20:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> Non-white people get the "personal responsibility" speech.
834467767831056384 2017-02-22 18:19:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is a bit mean/blunt, but I don't remember many Republicans obsessing over empathy re the problems of *non-white* lower-income people
834453223234613248 2017-02-22 17:22:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is a refreshing potential position to be in given GOP voter historically cruel stances re African-Americans, women, LBGT, etc. (4/4)
834452932435152896 2017-02-22 17:20:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think the real goal is to for conservatives to promote themselves as caring/empathetic/warm (3/x)
834452720069120000 2017-02-22 17:20:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> All these conservatives who think Dems need to be > empathetic to Trump voters - what's their goal? They obv don't want Dems to win. (2/x)
834452554201264128 2017-02-22 17:19:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> It wasn't until this election that I really understood the idea of concern trolling. (1/x)
834442874846482433 2017-02-22 16:40:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> I like Bret, but instead start w theory: GOP has manip'd hate, resentment & racism for yrs & Trump=result. See what's not explained by thathttps://twitter.com/stephenswsj/status/833834940827594752
834441841760014336 2017-02-22 16:36:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Republicans seem to always have a guy like Jeff Sessions, Strom Thurmond or Jesse Helms aroundhttps://twitter.com/sopandeb/status/834431574284320768
834273652107472896 2017-02-21 05:28:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom Tom what would you guess the % of Trump's core base represented by these young men
834272051565203456 2017-02-21 05:22:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ryanlcooper Because 1/There's no downside  2/He's gonna run or not no matter what she says 3/She wants his support later; flattery helps
834258985054138368 2017-02-21 04:30:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianefallon @jpodhoretz Brian is 100% right - it's invigorating/inspiring to see close fights. I feel great about the cabinet opposition.
834258531180163072 2017-02-21 04:28:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pegobry Sure, some ppl know to "take him seriously but not figuratively." But others believe his lies - ie voter fraud, crime stats, etc.

834192470762065920 2017-02-21 00:05:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KaraCalavera WaPo did a great job last year. CNN/NYT/AP should all be fired for their election coverage.
834192236292165632 2017-02-21 00:05:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @commiegirl1 @tommyxtopher Yeah but The Hill is relentless with this approach. They are worse than any other outlet.
834191845961854976 2017-02-21 00:03:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @commiegirl1 @tommyxtopher Another sig move: clickbait headline w/vague protagonist ID; reader must 2 click thru 2 fig out what's going on
834191271128240128 2017-02-21 00:01:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @commiegirl1 @tommyxtopher The Hill=absolute crap. Go-to move is to take another publisher's blog post & add a few new words/new headline

833936786149642240 2017-02-20 07:09:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CraigSJ so boring / such a waste of time
833918083915931648 2017-02-20 05:55:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> Another theory: conservatives aren't intolerant enough of misogyny, homophobia & racism  Start w/that & see what outcomes aren't explainedhttps://twitter.com/mattklewis/status/833907653470470146
833906722649493506 2017-02-20 05:10:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom 1 way to think about this: digital media allows leaders like Trump to quickly A/B test various messages of blame & resentment
833862570645663744 2017-02-20 02:15:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> yeah I totally agree with this. So much wasted energy over past few days re Milo
833861731898122240 2017-02-20 02:11:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang experts have been wrong before therefore let's use our instincts to decide whether Obama was the founder of ISIS

833755128825982976 2017-02-20 19:08:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @charlescwcooke your team needs to be focused looking inward rather than worrying about Berkeley. Incredible Milo was booked in 1st place

833566630743453697 2017-02-19 06:39:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @armillspaugh Ha. I really appreciate your patience. Normally I can't engage with people who (in my view) "harp on empathy"
833566441529958400 2017-02-19 06:38:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @armillspaugh OK fair enough. Wise words.

833565087881273344 2017-02-19 06:32:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @armillspaugh I'm in favor of improving the world, but also want to clearly call out ppl who are stupid, racist, misogynist. We can do both.
833564092283580416 2017-02-19 06:29:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @armillspaugh I would assert that that's not the only one that's racism. Racism (and misogyny, and antisemitism) is rampant in this group
833563604234276871 2017-02-19 06:27:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @armillspaugh If you rely on Infowars and similar sources for your information, you don't *want* to get smarter.
833563476492587010 2017-02-19 06:26:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @armillspaugh what kind of information parsing capabilities are required to know that Obama isn't a Muslim?

833412149170958337 2017-02-19 20:25:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang right, so let's not let those indifferent assholes off the hook. They own this outcome.
833410523530088448 2017-02-19 20:18:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang it must be big enough to justify his repeated race-baiting and antisemitic wink-winking
833410294177161216 2017-02-19 20:17:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang yes I totally agree
833408963613855744 2017-02-19 20:12:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang answer: because his base is filled with anti-semites!
833408881879511040 2017-02-19 20:12:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang why do you think Trump doesn't mention Jews in his Holocaust Remembrance Day statement?
833408752095072256 2017-02-19 20:11:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang it is impossible to characterize / assess Trump accurately without acknowledging the moral depravity of his base

833403113843220481 2017-02-19 19:49:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytimes @JGregRichardson count me out. I intend to characterize racism, misogyny and hatred accurately.
833402851170807808 2017-02-19 19:48:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang I think there's a role for those of us focused on not normalizing Trump and his supporters.
833399260976537600 2017-02-19 19:34:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> "Empathy!" and related concern trolling ("you won't win unless you care about white uneducated voters!") is just a distraction
833397642017153024 2017-02-19 19:27:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Republicans don't want us to call Trump voters racists because it highlights what they have done to this country
833393794837983232 2017-02-19 19:12:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @skupor @stevesi @ComfortablySmug @rabois I was joking
833393141323427840 2017-02-19 19:09:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @skupor @stevesi @rabois @ComfortablySmug or let's implement a border tax to tax goods not manufactured in the US
833377132969553920 2017-02-19 18:06:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois @jasonlankow and it's hardly clear to me how Trump/GOP policies help these people
833376958792626176 2017-02-19 18:05:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois @jasonlankow racist irony: if these poor voters were black, GOP would preach personal responsibility & throw drug users in jail

833365481830486017 2017-02-19 17:19:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois Trump was the fav stupid person candidate of our lifetime & Hillary was weak. On a sep note, do you think Trump will get primaried?

833361889652461568 2017-02-19 17:05:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois I'm not adding conditions to my prediction. Frame this tweet and post it in your favorite Khosla Ventures conference room.

833358833523175424 2017-02-19 16:53:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't see why this is true given that: 1. The election was razor-thin close 2. Democratic turnout will be jacked in 2020https://twitter.com/jonhaidt/status/833305362229035008
833208077499240448 2017-02-18 06:54:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realjudypordes mom you need a profile pic!
833176480146288640 2017-02-18 04:48:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BFriedmanDC Flynn doesn't count right? He was an incompetent traitor but wanted the job. Or maybe this list is a big tent.
833174886730260480 2017-02-18 04:42:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> If I want to be a French election troll, do I join reddit or Discord? Things you should know: 1. I don't speak French 2. I'm a quick learner
833173406392594432 2017-02-18 04:36:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jason I don't think this will work as well as you think, which is why FB Messenger has lots of friction
833172857697898496 2017-02-18 04:34:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jason trolls would love that
833134593393909760 2017-02-18 02:02:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> But other supporters (like that guy who showed up at Comet Pizza) are stupid & believe Trump's lies.
833134447700516865 2017-02-18 02:01:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> Many Trump supporters know to not "take him literally" & just enjoy giving elites the middle finger...
833129564574330881 2017-02-18 01:42:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is exactly the problem. Some Trump supporters get the joke, but *many* credulous others do notpic.twitter.com/J8DNHNRyUU
833127680669200384 2017-02-18 01:34:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> It would be great if someone toured America talking to people who don't like Hispanics so that we can appreciate their point of view
833127477610319872 2017-02-18 01:34:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> How can we develop empathy for people who don't like these Hispanics and Mexicans? Empathy is really important. https://twitter.com/chris_arnade/status/833121088834043904

833107588375990287 2017-02-18 00:15:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> My point is we don't need to cite reporters dying to counter Trump accusations that media/reporters = enemies of the people
833091924076564480 2017-02-18 23:12:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> These tweets are driving me crazy. We don't need to cite examples like Daniel Pearl & Marie Colvin to prove that the press is not the enemy.https://twitter.com/alexfromphilly/status/832964345860653056

833026685440126976 2017-02-18 18:53:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's out of fashion to say this but Obama really did drop the ball on dealing w Russia internet tampering in the run-up to the election
833020866925432832 2017-02-18 18:30:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GeorgeTakei Trolls would go batshit
833020822260326400 2017-02-18 18:30:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GeorgeTakei I used this strategy on Secret. I would post pic of some1 trolls really dislike w caption "[Name] is an internet treasure."

832841506863996930 2017-02-17 06:37:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @arthur_affect This is why Trump loves appearing with foreign leaders, Elon Musk, etc. Normalization benefit is huge.
832841426979344384 2017-02-17 06:37:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @arthur_affect Yeah. The legitimizing/normalizing impact of appearance overwhelms all other considerations.
832840491368452098 2017-02-17 06:33:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sarahcuda @dunn No it's not. The movie's fine, but the story is pretty derivative / a close-copy of Nemo. Plus there is too much going on.
832836758974783489 2017-02-17 06:18:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows There isn't even 1 other Sen like McCain, who doesn't care about reelection. Maybe Lindsey Graham, but then you lose Manchin.
832836458763350016 2017-02-17 06:17:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows Immediate opposition feels like a trip to quick irrelevance - look at Mark Sanford.
832836428782374912 2017-02-17 06:17:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows Arguably no. What vote could he have cast that would have mattered? I think he wants to look loyal for a while.
832835758851362818 2017-02-17 06:14:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows This may be right, but there's another theory: that McCain needs to stick with the home team until switching sides matters

832779638208278528 2017-02-17 02:31:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose yeah I heard from an iOS eng recently that autocorrect starts over from zero every time a new iOS x.0 ships
832748879560876032 2017-02-17 00:29:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro @NickRiccardi yeah I'm w Nick. Really not good 4 reporters to feel nervous/at physical risk, whether or not incidents have occurred.

832744745948426241 2017-02-17 00:13:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> I learned the word refactor today
832717836237705221 2017-02-17 22:26:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> And under the current circumstances, there isn't much we can do about it.
832717738250362882 2017-02-17 22:25:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think we need to stop worrying that many Americans think the media is dishonest. That really isn't the problem.
832690915663716352 2017-02-17 20:39:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter ads are increasingly straight hide-the-ball clickbaitpic.twitter.com/zoNnbomgQh
832690578978582529 2017-02-17 20:37:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricNewcomer @maxrogo OK touche. Maybe I'm wrong.
832690033471598593 2017-02-17 20:35:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricNewcomer @maxrogo "innovative veins"? C'mon it's GM! What's the last GM product that was awesome?
832689619426635776 2017-02-17 20:34:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricNewcomer to be clear, GM seems particularly unappealing as a partner. Maybe that's unfair.
832688479418978304 2017-02-17 20:29:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricNewcomer hmm. Multiple hedged bets doesn't seem as good as strong focus on a single good strategy
832687796720529409 2017-02-17 20:26:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @amir @EricNewcomer it's v contrary to hist pattern recognition that big clunkyco like GM can win in SDCs. They'll b impossible to work with
832685814312099841 2017-02-17 20:19:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's really hard to imagine that GM+Lyft can beat Uber (or even succeed at all)https://twitter.com/ericnewcomer/status/832685054090321921

832675097508864000 2017-02-17 19:36:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> mmm, mostly no. Apple is still so dominant in ID
832674138112167937 2017-02-17 19:32:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> at low-end? Prob no. And where low-end begins, I dunno. I will say, if u can afford iOS it's clearly where u want your life
832672845062762497 2017-02-17 19:27:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Apple's under-investment in autocorrect is infuriating. I'm trying Gboard again.
832659760080056322 2017-02-17 18:35:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jasontm yeah the harder thing is creating that experience for small products
832641934334193664 2017-02-17 17:24:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> I hope Apple is prioritizing making the iPhone/iPad speakers great. It feels like we are v close to not needing external speakers.
832636142994403329 2017-02-17 17:01:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> This Trump idea is fine and consistent with what Romney would have done. There are bigger issues to deal with.https://twitter.com/upshotnyt/status/832635799334244352

832625969131163652 2017-02-17 16:21:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brooke to be clear I'm all in favor of turning your pain into art
832625824159272961 2017-02-17 16:20:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brooke yeah. I didn't like any of the songs on Lemonade but kept that view to myself
832625012817293315 2017-02-17 16:17:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> And older artists generally fade from radio play
832624369759170560 2017-02-17 16:14:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> Lemonade was an (important) art project more than a collection of hit songs
832622723712983041 2017-02-17 16:08:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> The simplest reason why Lemonade is not getting radio airplay is that none of the songs are super-catchy/blockbuster hitshttps://twitter.com/simontarry76/status/832542543237771264

830934044036575232 2017-02-12 00:18:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is absolutely insane, clickbait bullshit. There is no way that Hillary is going to run again, and no way the party nominates her.https://twitter.com/politico/status/830839648779956224
830876314307432448 2017-02-12 20:28:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lpolovets stuff like this yes, but not this. Idea he can spend weekends at home and entertain there is not controversial w mainstream folks
830876163140632576 2017-02-12 20:28:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy I get you care but what's the point of protesting / speaking out?
830873199894159361 2017-02-12 20:16:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> We gotta stop wringing our hands about Mar a Lago. Nobody cares.https://twitter.com/thers/status/830639808498253824
830814926918676480 2017-02-12 16:24:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dickc I dunno, I think this guy is pretty powerful. Say, > than Valerie Jarrett was.
830812865888018432 2017-02-12 16:16:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericgarland I think that snark about personal appearance makes it seem like your opposition is personal rather than rooted in ideas
830811831862059008 2017-02-12 16:12:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericgarland I don't see the point of saying things like this. Why focus on his personal appearance?
830811636801744896 2017-02-12 16:11:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> Asking tough questions now won't excuse Stephanopoulos from his obsequious normalizing of Trump in 2016. Example: http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-george-stephanopoulos-interviews-donald-melania-trump/story?id=43104094https://twitter.com/gstephanopoulos/status/830793602255122432
830808099459981312 2017-02-12 15:57:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brooke he has a lot to make up for re being so soft during the election
830638743929237504 2017-02-11 04:44:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshuaforman my interp is simpler - Bernie wants his old message to be relevant & has no ear for/interest in current crises that matter
830635135179517953 2017-02-11 04:30:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> Reforming Wall Street is not a top-5 priority for our country right now, but Bernie doesn't want to hear it
830634797919711232 2017-02-11 04:29:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> Bernie just wants to talk about what Bernie wants to talk abouthttps://twitter.com/sensanders/status/830502920676323328
830566861804670976 2017-02-11 23:59:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thekenyeung eh, #1 and #3 aren't myths. Intel Capital is somewhat exceptional

830481133565468672 2017-02-11 18:18:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> Holey moley. God bless the internet for letting normal people organize like this. Mancur Olson said this wasn't possible.https://twitter.com/somebadideas/status/829985027958173696
830294205339537408 2017-02-10 05:55:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac I sense that you are not a man of traditional faith
830288281317224449 2017-02-10 05:32:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> Here's my take on Medium:  https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/01/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network-reconsidered/https://twitter.com/marcbodnick/status/830239928776679428
830284095804411906 2017-02-10 05:15:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @McFaul can Dems hold their feet to fire / investigate? Or can the WH wait it out / ignore?
830239928776679428 2017-02-10 02:19:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @trengriffin hmm. if anything Medium is too focused on the single-creator experience. The problem is the reader exp and engagement generally
830231026563624960 2017-02-10 01:44:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac @noahchestnut Hmm. If I lived in SF, I'd be more likely to drive if I knew I was staying in SF & not ending the night 1+ hr away
830230154571980800 2017-02-10 01:41:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac seems reasonable for drivers to be somewhat picky abt destination; I'm surprised Uber can't give dest info to them ahead of time
830220515260239873 2017-02-10 01:02:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> I hope this book has some good stories about Hillary's emailshttps://twitter.com/amychozick/status/830215305993580545
830202466142605313 2017-02-10 23:51:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom yeah I agree Tom
830173435816861696 2017-02-10 21:55:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel yeah I had this thought today also; I suspect it is widely shared.

829921640016273408 2017-02-09 05:15:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> The New York Times (here's an example of an article by @EricLichtblau) should be embarrassed by this. What a disaster.https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/829920433663262721
829775752451158017 2017-02-09 19:35:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac depends on which is growing
829575385025224707 2017-02-08 06:19:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ptraughber I click on an article, am not logged in, then log in, then get flipped to the NYT home page
829573806461112321 2017-02-08 06:13:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> Have you noticed NYTimes login issues when clicking from Twitter?
829536560701779969 2017-02-08 03:45:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> Manchin was only Dem who voted for Sessions. These Senators sincerely believe that Sessions is hostile toward civil/voting rights. https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/829504364092018688
829532737031659520 2017-02-08 03:29:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CaseyNewton @mmccue it does feel to me that feed is taking more and more share
829531010916249601 2017-02-08 03:22:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CaseyNewton @mmccue agree that Twitter makes all of this very difficult
829514943221227520 2017-02-08 02:19:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @peterdaou link is deleted
829514591835037696 2017-02-08 02:17:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonfavs yeah I think it's very possible that Trump's team gave him the OK on this
829493957268615168 2017-02-08 00:55:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac Mike it would be great if you could stimulate a similar conversation about Allied Arts in Menlo Park
829458578306015232 2017-02-08 22:35:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonfavs and Trump/his team don't care. It's like the ep of Law & Order where the husband & wife accuse each other of murder & both get off
829451583255502848 2017-02-08 22:07:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaketapper But that was a letter directed at one person about his daughter's play. Not a letter to a company defending his child's company.
829437256704233472 2017-02-08 21:10:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NormOrnstein @NoceraBV this only makes sense if Rosie will do a good job.
829413776793358336 2017-02-08 19:37:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @triketora I want this. When do I get it?

829412237563473924 2017-02-08 19:31:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rrhoover this looks very cool; are there any reviews yet from people describing whether it works?

829409340876414977 2017-02-08 19:19:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kimmaicutler eh, I'm not sure I'm buying it. Doing stuff to rile up the Dem base generally doesn't seem good for Republicans.
829408620261494786 2017-02-08 19:16:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CaseyNewton yeah once you tune Twitter enough (which takes too much work), you don't need news aggregation/"social news."
829408010116034560 2017-02-08 19:14:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CaseyNewton I have a theory that many news aggregator startups appealed to older VCs who don't love consuming content in feed format
829407507005050880 2017-02-08 19:12:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CaseyNewton If you are a power news reader, there's no reason to use any news aggregator other than Twitter.
829405255834050560 2017-02-08 19:03:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mcgd @can In this case I don't think this is whataboutism. What Michael is talking about = the real, structural problem in education.
829400060110659584 2017-02-08 18:42:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac what platform do you use?
829399540721528832 2017-02-08 18:40:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> All of this highlights (or maybe obscures?) grim reality that many GOP Senators & House members are flat-out racists -- especially Sessionshttps://twitter.com/mitchellreports/status/829182056110444548
829228501203091456 2017-02-07 07:20:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Yeah this is good. Good job @jaketapper.https://twitter.com/JamesFallows/status/829220913581326337
829203410197037056 2017-02-07 05:41:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's impossible to imagine a person with no qualifications serving in Trump's cabinet

828775639490519044 2017-02-06 01:21:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @redsteeze I had inferred that "they have their reasons and you understand that" implies intent to cover-up, or something like that.

827313320986234881 2017-02-02 00:30:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mallyvai @allenmhc I think it's a 2-way relationship. They aren't mainstream, but are an important part of Trump's coalition.
827311294554312704 2017-02-02 00:22:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mallyvai @allenmhc Bannon has the Breitbart base, which is very influential.
827285995519238144 2017-02-02 22:42:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> Did you ever read Thirteen Days? Other countries have to start thinking abt Trump the way JFK thought abt the Soviets' hard line 2nd cable
827278773200367616 2017-02-02 22:13:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mallyvai could be
827278725817315328 2017-02-02 22:13:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Related prediction: Morning Joe (@JoeNBC) will help drive this outcome
827277291050803201 2017-02-02 22:07:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's reasonably likely Tillerson/Mattis get Flynn fired & put Bannon somewhat back in his cage national security-wise. By year end.

827234996570120194 2017-02-02 19:19:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> My impression is that the # is over 1mm, given how many people like/RT Trump tweets. But other smart people I know think the # is < 100k.
827231038342516736 2017-02-02 19:03:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> How many people do you think are active readers of US politics Twitter?
827229141158105088 2017-02-02 18:56:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KaraCalavera we should ask @JaneMayerNYer
827228412393644032 2017-02-02 18:53:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KaraCalavera I assume you read Dark Money
827184343835566081 2017-02-02 15:58:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> Boy is this glass half-full. Trump was inclusive on Gorsuch because he doesn't care about that issue.https://twitter.com/mattmackowiak/status/827182546622492673
826974204662730753 2017-02-01 02:03:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> This headline is completely misleading. One subreddit is banned, not the alt-right community (which runs wild on reddit)https://twitter.com/gizmodo/status/826950460980469760
826913896762007552 2017-02-01 22:03:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @everybodyshirts @JesseDorogusker alternative: Dems less union-friendly, especially public sector unions
826896129790861312 2017-02-01 20:52:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> Civil rights and police abuse don't have a powerful special interest lobby to fight for it a la unions and traditional public educationhttps://twitter.com/MarcBodnick/status/826844823017517056
826894086099529728 2017-02-01 20:44:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump had many options in choosing someone with these ideological preferences. Too bad he made such a bad choice (2/2)
826893867450445824 2017-02-01 20:43:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> To be clear, DeVos opposition isn't motivated by lack of qualifications. People oppose her bc she wants to disrupt public education (1/x)https://twitter.com/MarcBodnick/status/826844823017517056
826890138869342208 2017-02-01 20:29:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> My Twitter ads are terrible: 1. "X celeb used to be fat; you'll never believe what they look like now" 2. Picture of a nearly-naked woman

826887740146868224 2017-02-01 20:19:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Gorsuch will b confirmed but I dont get why ppl care that he's such a good guy. Outcomes are outcomes. He's not interviewing 2b our soninlaw

826883452569923586 2017-02-01 20:02:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom 1. How worried are you abt Tillerson/Russia/Trump/Putin? 2. Are you worried Trump/Bannon will draw us into real war w/China?
826873920338817026 2017-02-01 19:24:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AlecMacGillis Are you saying that these senators are really opposed to DeVos on principle, or because they face political pressure?
826868345328656384 2017-02-01 19:02:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jessesingal Wouldn't any US president need to take an action like this?
826862918641737728 2017-02-01 18:40:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois @sean_a_rose @sarthakgh DeVos was picked solely bc her family= megacap GOP donors + Trump is obsessed w/financing his 2020 reelect
826860976670535680 2017-02-01 18:33:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois @sean_a_rose ...still it's my perception Dems are v focused on her bc it's education and unions are applying extraordinary pressure
826860682536554496 2017-02-01 18:32:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois @sean_a_rose I'm more cynical. Yes it's easy to oppose DeVos; I'm v pro-choice & frustrated Trump picked such a bad candidate but...
826858587368534016 2017-02-01 18:23:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @postben My point: in theory base opposes both candidates but the teacher unions dominate the base in terms of power. Hence, the outcome.
826852933824176128 2017-02-01 18:01:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PatrickRuffini @postben It's not in Dem self-interest to oppose Sessions as much as DeVos. A parsimonious theory that explains all outcomes
826852441102577664 2017-02-01 17:59:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @everybodyshirts Teacher unions=rational. I'm blaming Dems 4 being beholden 2 them. Dems are crazy on DeVos not Sessions bc union dominance
826847125396795393 2017-02-01 17:38:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @everybodyshirts No. But Sessions is worse/just as worse. And I'm explaining why there is more concerted opposition to DeVos.
826845441874538496 2017-02-01 17:31:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't see how this is bad for CNN. Trump ppl say nothing truthful/interesting. @washingtonpost got ++ better after losing Trump accesshttps://twitter.com/RawStory/status/826777292529606656
826844823017517056 2017-02-01 17:29:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's not "bullshit" -- it's the direct result of teacher union control of the Democratic Partyhttps://twitter.com/EmmyA2/status/826832207998181376

826691811045318656 2017-01-31 07:21:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> There *is* a strong argument for Dems to keep their powder dry for fights that are both important and winnable (2/x)
826691639049457664 2017-01-31 07:20:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Republicans obstruct when it's politically useful. They obstructed Garland but not Kagan or Sotomayor. (1/x)

826655871912407040 2017-01-31 04:58:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom You can't be serious. If Roe is overturned abortion will likely be prohibited in many red states.
826620999781081089 2017-01-31 02:39:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @adamnash I guess. Broader context is that 3 liberals are up next.

826196823316402176 2017-01-30 22:34:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> So true. When perp is white, language used implies "this is a one-off; no broad conclusions to be drawn."https://twitter.com/marcushjohnson/status/826195519194140672

826109082662686720 2017-01-30 16:45:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lachlan @kenvogel But the fact that Trump is a Republican president and the Kochs are critical of authoritarian overreach? Meaningful (2/2)
826109032465256448 2017-01-30 16:45:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lachlan @kenvogel You are misreading this. Obama was a full-blown opponent of Kochs, so any criticism like this was to be expected. (1/2)

824042415166099456 2017-01-24 23:53:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @netflix @HBO @adamnash Eh, you gotta stop watching almost any show after 2-3 seasons.
824042274950479872 2017-01-24 23:52:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @eric_seufert New realization for me: - Way more fun when lots of ppl watch same show - Power of N content strategy to leverage ubiquity
824040996090494976 2017-01-24 23:47:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @adamnash And a big part of this is the feeling that tons of people (esp young people) are watching Netflix shows.
824040851407966208 2017-01-24 23:47:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HBO @adamnash maybe. I feel like Netflix's programming are the shows of the future (The OA, Stranger Things, Black Matter) vs HBO.
824040625607577600 2017-01-24 23:46:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> Netflix is super-cheap, but still provides so many great shows. This is how you get a ton of people to buy your service.
824039712960561152 2017-01-24 23:42:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> Netflix shows seem way more relevant because everyone watches them. Everyone I know under 30 has Netflix, but way less than half have HBO.

823407343702450180 2017-01-22 05:49:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy I can't imagine you'll think it's good enough once you are in a Tesla for a while.
823406547376082945 2017-01-22 05:46:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy can't imagine
823404716138733568 2017-01-22 05:39:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy Mmm. I've had an X for a while & I'm pretty confident they are going to get there and then really blow past traditional automakers
823402539697569792 2017-01-22 05:30:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @feross yep.
823402032782397440 2017-01-22 05:28:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy I can't imagine I'd consider another car for my kids when they are old enough to drive.
823402004412121088 2017-01-22 05:28:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy I don't care about that. I'm talking about the sensors & added protection from knowing better/faster that you're in trouble.
823401289224589312 2017-01-22 05:25:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Once you drive a Tesla for a while, it's hard to imagine that everyone won't be driving them in a few years. So much safer.
823321488547725312 2017-01-22 00:08:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> The big lie is harder to do given that the internet exists.

822914664551960576 2017-01-21 21:11:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DLind @jessesingal you can't be serious. It's obviously a lie.
822909148861870080 2017-01-21 20:50:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarkMazzettiNYT shouldn't the New York Times call Trump's assertion about crowd size a "lie" and that he was "lying"?

822873200551817216 2017-01-21 18:27:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think CNN is atrocious also, but at least they have some journalists (Jake Tapper, Jim Acosta). There is no one like that at Fox.

822244999349682178 2017-01-19 00:50:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose My main sources: Today's Top Hits, Release Radar, my 13yo daughter (we have a family Spotify account), Twitter/Moments.
822238906565332994 2017-01-19 00:26:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jasommer Yeah. As crazy as that is to imagine (what about bands & albums?!?) I think this may result in an explosion of awesome music.
822238115918061568 2017-01-19 00:23:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> The opposite is happening with movies, where marketing costs have skyrocketed and quality has plummeted.
822238013904142336 2017-01-19 00:23:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> In other words: as the cost of creating and marketing a new song goes to zero, we all get to listen to a lot better music.
822235956568694784 2017-01-19 00:15:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> No need for 1 size fits all (3/3)
822235894853705728 2017-01-19 00:14:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> I prefer US daily charts of systemwide most-popular music. Others prefer personalized Daily Mixes, Discover Weekly, Release Radar. (2/x)
822235350722428929 2017-01-19 00:12:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Spotify is offering many different playlist types, because people have different preferences, including global vs. personalized (1/x)https://twitter.com/joshpuckett/status/821783810366787584
822226831457677312 2017-01-19 23:38:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> Spotify's Today's Top Hits playlist is the biggest threat to radio/Pandora. Once they start segmenting that list by genre, it's over.
822206922682048512 2017-01-19 22:19:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's the Today's Top Hits playlist which really highlights this
822206114192236544 2017-01-19 22:16:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is really great for music - established artists don't have an advantage just because they've had previous success

821590954058674176 2017-01-17 05:32:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HotlineJosh @tltroup I don't see Ds fitting this description. They/their allies are invariably union-dependent. Maybe I'm missing something
821589239351705601 2017-01-17 05:25:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy I'm more worried about another 40 years (and two generation of kids) having to use this same, broken system.
821588978197561346 2017-01-17 05:24:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HotlineJosh @tltroup Proponents of mkt-based change in K-12 feel (1) system is altogether broken & (2) insiders are too beholden to unions
821588430954135552 2017-01-17 05:22:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy People like BD & myself feel the only way to make mkt-driven change in K-12 is 2 b as forceful as countervailing union intransigence
821588003437051904 2017-01-17 05:20:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HotlineJosh @joshtpm @Burrite "Unprepared" != why Dems up in arms. Randi Weingarten would be fine w/anyone supporting union interests
821586334628265985 2017-01-17 05:13:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> When the interests of teachers' unions are threatened, Dems go nuclear. (2/2)
821586112510500864 2017-01-17 05:12:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'll amplify @HotlineJosh's point. It's "telling" that DeVos is getting worst fire b/c it reveals how powerful teachers' unions are. (1/2)https://twitter.com/trevormail/status/821580420538101760
821584421656489985 2017-01-17 05:06:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshtpm @HotlineJosh the opposition to DeVos is harsher and much more pointed. The left *really* is gunning for DeVos.
821578783853400064 2017-01-17 04:43:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> The left should be more outraged about Sessions & Tillerson. @HotlineJosh is absolutely right to make this point.https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/821577773638676481

821472482813087744 2017-01-17 21:41:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'd be interested in engaging in conversation on this topic, but I don't have a strong enough view to "go first."

820062071538626561 2017-01-13 00:16:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose yeah I see your point. So who knows. But most of my current internet life feels closer to instructions & words v spreadsheets.
820059165963915264 2017-01-13 00:05:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans I'm referring to expressing thoughts/preferences - not typing. Not sure if that makes sense.
820058630841974784 2017-01-13 00:03:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @millsbaker yeah. TBC I could imagine blend of voice/screens/text. Example: dictation on iOS = my fav way of posting questions to Quora now
820056097658585088 2017-01-13 23:53:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> I guess maybe we could just leapfrog to heads-up displays; thinking is def easier than talking. But that sure feels like a long ways off.
820055801037324288 2017-01-13 23:51:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> I understand some skepticism, but my exp is that voice UIs are often better (and getting even better over time) vs typing on mobile devicehttps://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/819644433461231616

819769382045761536 2017-01-12 04:53:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu that @jimrutenberg post was really bad
819718234656022528 2017-01-12 01:30:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Much of Trump's appeal vs Hillary was rooted in unconscious misogyny. With Hillary gone, fewer people are motivated to strongly support him
819716778175512576 2017-01-12 01:24:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jimrutenberg @gabrielsherman An atrocious article. A classic NYT rationalization of: (1) moral =ence & (2) Vichy-like accomodation w/Trump
819698841175764992 2017-01-12 00:13:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sarahkendzior Do you think it was hacking by RT?
819691161233199104 2017-01-12 23:42:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarkHarrisNYC I hear you & respect that POV. For me, I'd rather the NYT turn over their entire editorial budget to the Post
819690410381479936 2017-01-12 23:39:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo when are you going
819690214901714944 2017-01-12 23:39:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarkHarrisNYC I felt that way 12 months ago, but not now. Their election coverage was atrocious IMO.
819690083938959360 2017-01-12 23:38:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarkHarrisNYC I think they are systematically dropping the ball, unwilling to strike the same aggressive position as the Washington Post.
819687715167817728 2017-01-12 23:29:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarkHarrisNYC What is your view overall about the NYT's coverage of all things Trump?
819687618912796672 2017-01-12 23:28:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Yes - this tweet thread is exactly right; echoes what I was sayinghttps://twitter.com/MarkHarrisNYC/status/819682788228104192
819687288741298176 2017-01-12 23:27:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonathanweisman @ywxwy I'm fine with each of us deciding on our own which one of them lied.
819686725953818624 2017-01-12 23:25:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kumailn I guess the question is - what do you think Obama should be doing differently?
819686088880992256 2017-01-12 23:22:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> NYTimes headline is remarkably neutral. Shouldn't default suspicion w/Russians be hacking? Russia gets > benefit of doubt than Hillary didhttps://twitter.com/nytimes/status/819671811227009024
819684760930820097 2017-01-12 23:17:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @adatta02 Woodward & Bernstein looked like assholes until they were vindicated. I thought this was what journalists were supposed to do.
819683551692128256 2017-01-12 23:12:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonathanweisman The NYT resists calling Trump a liar, even when it's 100% truth. Headline here should note that 1 of them is lying.
819682031927836673 2017-01-12 23:06:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tripgabriel @williamjordann absent Comey II, Hillary clearly wins
819680341044523008 2017-01-12 22:59:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> Seems like people want to act like we need some new magic solution - because they want to avoid the uncomfortableness of persistence (5/5)
819680046197526528 2017-01-12 22:58:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> How about just digging in, doing investigative research, and keep asking the same questions when they don't get answered? (4/x)
819679857059635200 2017-01-12 22:58:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> I see many reporters' tweets along the lines of "how can we handle this master of the media black arts and his new rules." (3/x)
819679177028681728 2017-01-12 22:55:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> Seems to me like it forced Trump to confront a bunch of issues which he's been trying to avoid (2/x)
819678863357685760 2017-01-12 22:54:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's not clear why people think Trump's press conference was so brilliant (1/x)
819674983014141952 2017-01-12 22:38:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonathanweisman Ah I see your point. But we can agree that one of them is lying, right?
819653294289080320 2017-01-12 21:12:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonathanweisman Hold on, didn't Trump clearly lie in characterizing Clapper's response? How is there ambiguity?
819651910927978496 2017-01-12 21:06:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> I know I'm following too many politics writers when there are ~100 tweets in my timeline about Biden's Medal of Freedom
819648409975984128 2017-01-12 20:53:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy ha, yeah. January action movies are almost always crap.
819584417647599616 2017-01-12 16:38:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @can he's super-smart. I couldn't disagree more w him re Trump. But part of me is glad that someone in the industry is close to Trump
819574317553827842 2017-01-12 15:58:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricBoehlert CNN, NBC, Fox seem craven. Who are potential leaders here? I only see Washington Post.

819367380325265408 2017-01-11 02:16:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro My takeaway as well. The absence of Hillary as the opponent + America's general lack of interest post-election = changing dynamic
819267799646208000 2017-01-11 19:40:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> My view on TVhttps://twitter.com/marcbodnick/status/819265533585465344
819267022903087104 2017-01-11 19:37:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo Rather than saying we're in period of fragmentation I'd say we're in period where gap btwn hi/lo quality has become esp clear (6/6)
819266448908382208 2017-01-11 19:35:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo Today we are in golden age of TV storytelling. True, some viewers still prefer NCIS & other formulaic/brainless comfort food (5/x)
819265682441277441 2017-01-11 19:32:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo Today's TV offers extraordinary high-quality, original, creative, interesting stories - for those who want it. (4/x)
819265533585465344 2017-01-11 19:31:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo Also I think you're romanticizing TV of the past. Most serial TV is crap & has been for decades - super-formulaic/repetitive. (3/x)
819265320435130368 2017-01-11 19:30:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo Although it's interesting pop music hasn't fragmented as much. Every1 listens to same stuff I think or at least as much as b4 (2/x)
819264989357690881 2017-01-11 19:29:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo Super-interesting, but Netflix/fragmentation of video is just a subset of overall media fragmentation enabled by internet (1/x)
819262039533047808 2017-01-11 19:17:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonfavs @paulg yeah but then the reporter will get punished/lose some access.

818679946398699520 2017-01-09 04:44:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sahilkapur gloating and gravedancing seem like powerful motivators for the deplorables
818679422244909056 2017-01-09 04:42:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sahilkapur Why else would deplorables stop tweeting?
818679395535753220 2017-01-09 04:42:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sahilkapur regardless of source (Russian or otherwise) the fake account hypothesis is consistent w your observation.
818678356434558976 2017-01-09 04:38:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sahilkapur do you think this reflects Russian bots/fake accounts?
817487642967228416 2017-01-06 21:46:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mattajord I think she would be less polarizing as NYC mayor. Trump and his minions can't hurt her in that role.
817487334413172736 2017-01-06 21:45:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> 50/50. (I know that sounds like a cheat.) I imagine she's studying the opp carefully now and is talking closely w Bloomberg.
817484705725497344 2017-01-06 21:35:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Mattajord de Blasio is terrible for the Dems; he's out of central casting as the perfect foil to Trump.
817482451991674880 2017-01-06 21:26:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> Would be much better for her legacy if she ended her career as Mayor of NYC. She could lead loyal opp to Trump - help party/country. (4/4)
817482152635863040 2017-01-06 21:25:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> She'd have Bloomberg's support. Many Dems & independents despise de Blasio. Would be good for Democrats if she replaced him. (3/x)
817481983102046208 2017-01-06 21:24:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's a pretty straightforward race. There's no Republican to deal with, no Republican influence. And she's to the right of de Blasio. (2/x)
817481717166395392 2017-01-06 21:23:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think it's reasonably likely that Hillary runs for Mayor of New York. (1/x)
817480011850485760 2017-01-06 21:16:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MatthewACherry Yeah, this point can't be emphasized enough. It's like they think they can cheat on the headline.

813914746936315908 2016-12-27 01:09:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> If I were part of the Trump movement I would be very upset with people who can't hide their antisemitism and racismhttps://twitter.com/mediaite/status/813784976638570496
813851538447859712 2016-12-27 20:58:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> ...even if that content wasn't popular. But now, news businesses pretty much have to give their readers what they want to hear.
813851337624588292 2016-12-27 20:57:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Before the internet obliterated journalistic oligopolies, quality news outlets could publish what they thought was truthful & important...
813851010439512064 2016-12-27 20:56:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> The Washington Post - funded by Jeff Bezos - stands as the sole exception
813850857628434432 2016-12-27 20:55:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's unclear whether for-profit companies can generate high-quality journalism at scale
813823614776537088 2016-12-27 19:07:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tomgara great example of how names really don't matter that much
813816661165875200 2016-12-27 18:39:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @lessin @theinformation I don't understand the argument that tech companies should go public to win the public's admiration
813809068217397254 2016-12-27 18:09:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bwerde @AdamSinger try this searchpic.twitter.com/3UkMicw8W1

813792327957364737 2016-12-27 17:03:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is great news. Would be terrific if the Post could compete in TV/broadcast news over time. We need alternative to dogshit CNN.https://twitter.com/politico/status/813791622974607364
813445418122088448 2016-12-26 18:04:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JWGOP @Voters4Kasich it's remarkable that Twitter doesn't shut down these bot accounts
813135875878043648 2016-12-25 21:34:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattdpearce not true for Trump ppl. They often have multiple intended sympathetic audiences. And confusing opponents is considered a plus
813129086847610881 2016-12-25 21:07:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jason I think you should make the distinction btwn fully automated media (FB, G, YT, TWTR) vs variations on paid writing (Vice, BF, Vox)

812834135979020288 2016-12-24 01:35:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose It's the Post not the Times which is the last bastion of courageous journalism
812833234761486340 2016-12-24 01:31:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu do you have a view on this AJ Delgado thing? No MSM outlet or blog mentions it in their story
812832639740743680 2016-12-24 01:29:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> The Times is supposed to tell us (including in the headline) whether the Trumps are *sincerely* trying to resolve conflicts. cc @maggieNYT
812832233119694848 2016-12-24 01:28:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> The headline is so neutral and spineless
812829034191187968 2016-12-24 01:15:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> Once again the New York Times whitewashing and normalizing Trump corruptionhttps://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/812760002884734977
812828815839870976 2016-12-24 01:14:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Would be great to get @maggieNYT's take on this (since she wrote the original story that Judd links to)https://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/812760002884734977
812773346609942529 2016-12-24 21:34:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GrantHenryHall @varunsriram @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt I was joking - why hold Paladino to a different standard than the Trump sons etc
812475579433971712 2016-12-23 01:50:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> Crazy - there's no logical reason why @realDonaldTrump would ban Carl Paladino from his inauguration. Paladino has been loyal supporter.https://twitter.com/hughhewitt/status/812474471768530944
812475201359409152 2016-12-23 01:49:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hughhewitt Why would the PEOTUS ban Paladino from inauguration? Totally crazy.

811288848542134272 2016-12-20 19:15:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @delong Reminds me of when Jesse Helms & Strom Thurmond died and the coverage was polite/positive.
811109247576657920 2016-12-19 07:21:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @McFaul All but Spotify and Kindle came from California
810919047835557888 2016-12-19 18:45:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mikiebarb Honestly this is a big loss IMO bc you've been one of NYT's only politics reporters to challenge Trump with consistent strength
810708696074436608 2016-12-18 04:49:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> I love the idea that GOP wouldn't be lobbying electors in face of such a corrupt victor/victory. These protestations should just be ignored.https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/810707914658824192
810707766646022144 2016-12-18 04:46:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisgeidner @jilltataraworld this is how I feel. Looks like equivalence.

810553399250915336 2016-12-18 18:32:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katelosse @artypapers @ywxwy I'm open for a wager on this.
810552728606961664 2016-12-18 18:30:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katelosse @artypapers yeah I think he will build more/something substantial. I don't see how he can not do this.
810552370367238147 2016-12-18 18:28:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katelosse @artypapers I'm pretty sure we will see some kind of wall
810550446238605312 2016-12-18 18:21:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SonnyBunch @dandrezner disagree - this is a legitimate POV that reasonable ppl can argue about. Spielberg has made v little good in a while
810548386684342272 2016-12-18 18:12:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allenmhc this is nearly entirely a Republican problem; Democrats generally don't do this. (I say this as an independent/centrist.)
810547303190818816 2016-12-18 18:08:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> The fact Trump voters often believe wrong stuff is right is important/scary regardless of Trump victory. Pizzagate thinking is a cancer.https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/810546806048309248
810546524379877377 2016-12-18 18:05:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Based on what rationale/evidence?https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/810546297002455040
810546057130217472 2016-12-18 18:03:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> If Hillary had won a razor-thin victory w support of Russian hackers (ie authentic election rigging) they'd be going full throttle batshit
810545637771137025 2016-12-18 18:01:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> Conservative handwringing about delegitimization is a f--king joke after 8 years of indulging birtherismhttps://twitter.com/amconmag/status/810545166926942208
810544128819949569 2016-12-18 17:55:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @redsteeze @davidfrum I don't understand your point. You think the Washington Post poll is inaccurate?
810511326678228992 2016-12-18 15:45:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jdh what do you mean? What's radio royalties?
810508413952290817 2016-12-18 15:33:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jdh I suspect lots of accounts had this problem. I had the same problem until last summer (both girls on my acct). Now everything is Ok.
810506536166588417 2016-12-18 15:26:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jdh are you on family plan now?
810304975452721152 2016-12-17 02:05:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac you should start talking loudly about how Trump will fix this line
810303461581590528 2016-12-17 01:59:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @aguynamedben there is one at JFK also
810302324652605440 2016-12-17 01:55:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine @abhinavsharma my goal is to be maximally lazy
810247106023788544 2016-12-17 22:15:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alexandr_wang don't know many categories as well as this one
810243866997694464 2016-12-17 22:02:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alexandr_wang I'll bet you dinner that by end of 2018 Spotify will clearly have beaten A Music/providing better value to consumers/artists
810242685617537024 2016-12-17 21:58:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alexandr_wang oh also you can file Tidal on my old blog
810241904977805312 2016-12-17 21:54:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alexandr_wang It's getting harder and harder for an artist to forgo opening week or month on Spotify
810241796567666690 2016-12-17 21:54:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alexandr_wang Spotify audience/distro will work against Apple exclusives. Spotify had JCole Weeknd Bruno Mars releases - they have momentum
810229610365521920 2016-12-17 21:06:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's remarkable how many tweets are driven by/reacting to outrage. Not surprising given Trump polarization, but it degrades TL badly.
810211452351082496 2016-12-17 19:53:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PatrickRuffini No, there are a bunch of different playlists. Some are newish. Today's Top Hits, Release Radar, Your Daily Mix 1/2/3/4
810204859408547840 2016-12-17 19:27:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mims I suspect that if Oracle is up for doing it, it won't matter what Lyft says
810196091983499264 2016-12-17 18:52:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine Agree. But what's interesting is if the hit rate is really high, I'm suddenly way more open to near-non-stop new artists.
810195835061407744 2016-12-17 18:51:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy They have completely blown out Discovery Weekly - so many other playlists now.
810195704677339136 2016-12-17 18:51:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine For me the real ML magic is #3 - showing me new artists that I've *never* heard of (!) based on my past preferences
810194877581590528 2016-12-17 18:48:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine I'm not interested in listening to what my friends consume; I want to listen to songs that MY past prefs indicate I'll like
810194681946636288 2016-12-17 18:47:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine I think they needed to wait until ML+data got good enough (1/x)
810193801935523840 2016-12-17 18:43:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jason Go through the "Your Library" and "Browse" tabs. They seem to be everywhere now! I'll send some screenshots later.
810192446466523141 2016-12-17 18:38:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> Feels like when FB introduced News Feed bringing me a stream of the best content that could be passively read, staying in the zone (3/x)
810192186906177536 2016-12-17 18:37:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Now I'm consuming tons of music that's pushed to me instead of spending a bunch of time looking for it (2/x)
810191982861676545 2016-12-17 18:36:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Spotify has fundamentally changed over past 6 months - new automated playlists are so good (1/x)
810160926124961792 2016-12-17 16:33:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricRWeinstein 80/20 solution to complexity: figure out which outlets consistently produce crap & crush their distro- ie Macedonian garbage
810159622547832832 2016-12-17 16:28:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> Release Radar is the best list so farpic.twitter.com/5HeZWXF4k9
810159189821489153 2016-12-17 16:26:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> My discovery has gone through the roof with all these new lists - this feels like game over for the categorypic.twitter.com/UzDM3cmnn2
810017364074897408 2016-12-16 07:02:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bryce why is this true necessarily? Can't someone prefer to invest post-product and still consider themselves early stage?
810012526352023552 2016-12-16 06:43:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @homebrew @satyap you guys must be exhausted
810003497114402816 2016-12-16 06:07:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricRWeinstein I guess the exception are the individuals killed in the genocide
810001309160054784 2016-12-16 05:58:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytimes @tristanwalker @Anerbenami those were the days when the New York Times had courage/conviction/a willingness to speak truth to power
810000384043454464 2016-12-16 05:55:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kevinwalzer @dangillmor @tolles you aren't having enough impact. Your party is dominated by those who actively suppress or stay silent.
809997938382381056 2016-12-16 05:45:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> Spotify has exploded with killer personalized playlists.pic.twitter.com/Bgp04hshut
809993564960616448 2016-12-16 05:28:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dangillmor who else besides Joe Manchin, who seems like a Republican
809986140199473152 2016-12-16 04:58:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> I know this POV is out of favor but I trust Uber more than the State of Californiahttps://twitter.com/wired/status/809976820053311488
809925110454960128 2016-12-16 00:56:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PhilleoJ disagree. The mix is overwhelmingly conservative.
809919044329603072 2016-12-16 00:32:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ayiyi: all these GOP rationalizations. Fake news arose bc GOP outlets find it in their interest to spread/GOP followers believe fake storieshttps://twitter.com/BruceBartlett/status/809918313329491968

809890312382398465 2016-12-16 22:37:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Many people at the @nytimes are OK using the words "lie" & "liar" when it comes to Donald Trump - except for the newsroomhttps://twitter.com/michikokakutani/status/809889886736175105
809864887153266688 2016-12-16 20:56:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RyanLizza @BrentNYT yes I'm aware/agree that @mikiebarb has guts and is consistently willing to speak truth to power. Love him.
809834955219996673 2016-12-16 18:57:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RyanLizza @BrentNYT I'm talking about *News* using the word
809807087857373184 2016-12-16 17:07:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RyanLizza @BrentNYT @jakeroche no chance Trump would win or sue over this. Times is gutless if this is their worry
809805580005015552 2016-12-16 17:01:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nikhilbd @robennals IOW, how does G easily leverage Maps to get into ridesharing biz? Doesn't seem like something G would do well
809804881187905536 2016-12-16 16:58:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @beLaurie @louisgray Twitter also now lets you create your own Moment
809804402269618176 2016-12-16 16:56:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RyanLizza @BrentNYT @jakeroche oh c'mon - intent is clear, given his intelligence
809802844144484353 2016-12-16 16:50:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @robennals ?? Maps != product w ppl ordering rides/buying cars. Wouldn't Lyft have been natural way to deploy SDCs a la Uber? cc @nikhilbd
809788886037590016 2016-12-16 15:54:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RyanLizza @BrentNYT why won't the Times use the word "lie"?
809639271988502528 2016-12-15 06:00:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @robennals and why didn't they acquire Lyft?
809552237772951552 2016-12-15 00:14:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PostBaron is it ok to say that Trump is lying and that he's a liarhttps://twitter.com/pamkrugerwriter/status/809548692306923520
809551847593676800 2016-12-15 00:12:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't understand this logichttps://twitter.com/shutupandrosky/status/809547595890573312
809547000920190976 2016-12-15 23:53:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Only the Post does this. You can practically feel CNN and the NYTimes craving to move on to the next story.
809546678223015936 2016-12-15 23:52:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is how you stay with an important story for more than one dayhttps://twitter.com/theplumlinegs/status/809463573017726976
809539071047450624 2016-12-15 23:22:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PamKrugerwriter At some point, do you use the word "kick" when someone's foot hits another person's body? How do you prove intent there?
809538808349749248 2016-12-15 23:21:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PamKrugerwriter If a smart person repeatedly doesn't tell truth when they know truth, that's lying - not accidents.
809536987103301632 2016-12-15 23:13:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @freddoso Why facepalm? Clearly there is some appetite for this topic among some of Trump's supporters.
809536711063584768 2016-12-15 23:12:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> Reason this is imp: "lies" implies intent + systematic intent to not tell truth. "Falsely"=less informative: characterizes statement only
809536294640435201 2016-12-15 23:11:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's all over the internet that @nytimes uses headline "falsely" instead of "lies" here. @SangerNYT it would be great if you could explain.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/809490741395333120
809526838116556801 2016-12-15 22:33:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hmm what could be the differences... is it that Obama is less gracious than GWB, or that Trump is a fundamentally different actor vs Obama?https://twitter.com/jgm41/status/809467853715881984
809503860855291904 2016-12-15 21:02:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allenmhc To me it's less about ignoring history and more about ignoring the general product principles re MVP/fast dev velocity
809502419897847808 2016-12-15 20:56:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allenmhc yeah. But a lot of us believed Google could do it/was going to do it, despite the mega-slow-dev-velocity/Max-VP approach
809501001728151552 2016-12-15 20:50:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allenmhc lots to discuss. My main thought: for 3+ yrs SV conv wis was GOOG would have SDCs on road soon & that they'd be leader in category
809494542911057920 2016-12-15 20:25:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> I feel like this Google downshifting on self-driving cars should be treated as a bigger thing
809487271858573312 2016-12-15 19:56:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine this seems fine / accurate / thoughtful
809482639019110400 2016-12-15 19:37:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Seems good - if Kellogg is reasonable he's a hot spare if Flynn melts down (likely)https://twitter.com/Phil_Mattingly/status/809476413631959040
809471926817034241 2016-12-15 18:55:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pbump Good point, @anonchickenshit -- Quora would love to have President-Elect Trump do a Session
809471552290836480 2016-12-15 18:53:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pbump Yeah I'm a huge Post fan, so I probably picked the wrong source to tweet when complaining about this. Carry on.
809471403204325376 2016-12-15 18:53:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pbump @ywxwy I'm not convinced that media can worry about multiple issues at different intensities. To be clear, the WP is an exception.
809471214460620800 2016-12-15 18:52:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pbump It's easier to talk about/cover this issue (lack of press conferences) because no investigation/research/hard sourcing is needed.
809470358533193728 2016-12-15 18:49:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pbump there are 20 things we should care about way more than press conferences
809469998720688128 2016-12-15 18:47:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pbump of course I agree. But I'd rather focus on Nth story on Russian hacking; Trump biz conflicts; what Rudy knew about hacking; etc etc
809469127999954944 2016-12-15 18:44:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> Another issue no one cares about -- Trump not doing press conferences. Versus many other issues, this seems like a waste of time to focus onhttps://twitter.com/pbump/status/809468451353817088
809467515772379136 2016-12-15 18:37:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac you can be my guardian of the truth any day
809440519189188608 2016-12-15 16:50:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is only true if the press keeps focusing on these issueshttps://twitter.com/johnjharwood/status/809433978822414336

809156999866818560 2016-12-14 22:03:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> Letting Ivanka have space in FLOTUS office is fine. You have no outrage filter if you care about something stupid like this.
809074430471073792 2016-12-14 16:35:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricNewcomer not lazy
809074133707329536 2016-12-14 16:34:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricNewcomer NYT systematically overcovering H email & undercovering DT corruption - destructive, given their authority and influence
809074038291083264 2016-12-14 16:34:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricNewcomer agree there r many problems. But faux authority of NYT, CNN is 1 of them.
809072066167119872 2016-12-14 16:26:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricNewcomer could not disagree more w this analogue
809071919362248704 2016-12-14 16:25:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricLiptonNYT @EricNewcomer If I think NYT failed badly it's not rude to say so. 2nd best doesn't describe how badly they covered HRC v DT
809070962310160387 2016-12-14 16:22:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricLiptonNYT @EricNewcomer so you think the Post and Times did about equally good work?
809057258801745920 2016-12-14 15:27:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pfpicardi have u tried office hrs as a model? Set up 60-90 min weekly slot at same time/let ppl book in 10 min blocks on shared spreadsheet
809055530077405184 2016-12-14 15:20:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pfpicardi at Quora we shifted to 30 minutes as the default, years ago. The burden to justify 60 minutes was high

808823914449149952 2016-12-13 00:00:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricLiptonNYT @sarahcuda @DaveLeeBBC Disagree. NYT obsessed over H email; wouldn't call out DT for gaslighting, lying, race-baiting...
808820275336708096 2016-12-13 23:45:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> This story is too late. We need good journalism in time for it to matter. The NYTimes has completely & consistently failed in this regard.https://twitter.com/ericliptonnyt/status/808761486973796352
808760544333209605 2016-12-13 19:48:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Basically CNN is just exploiting its brand (which used to stand for reasonable quality) to sell crap & clickbait
808760367413268481 2016-12-13 19:47:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> CNN plays cute games w/headlines & guests (see article below), dumbing down its audience & plays to basest instinctshttp://www.cnn.com/2016/12/12/opinions/russia-role-shocking-but-not-hacked-douglas/index.html
808758977114750976 2016-12-13 19:42:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Jeff Zucker is not a journalist; he's a media exec focused on bottom line. Ditto NBC/Comcast. And the NYT's editorial team is gutless (5/5)
808758617553838080 2016-12-13 19:40:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Of all of these mediacos, only the WP is willing to stick its neck out & take risk. Presumably that's bc it has $ deep pockets (4/x)
808758292021264384 2016-12-13 19:39:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> CNN needs to be characterized as tabloid journalism garbage. Jake Tapper & Anderson Cooper are good, but overall the product is toxic (3/x)
808758015025217536 2016-12-13 19:38:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Those of us who follow news have to aggressively call out CNN, NBC, AP as complete crap, and the New York Times as highly unreliable (2/x)
808757752629633024 2016-12-13 19:37:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> I've been a broken record arguing that the Washington Post is the only reputable major news source left, but it's true (1/x)
808741962450812928 2016-12-13 18:34:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose yeah right. LP=incred ldr beyond ads/search - Maps, Android. However, maybe crazy more-than-software moonshots R bridges 2 far
808740225702690816 2016-12-13 18:27:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mekosoff good example: https://twitter.com/kaysteiger/status/808727516223512576  Media (esp TV news) doesn't push Trump on what matters & often focuses on celeb non-stories
808739402801217536 2016-12-13 18:24:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is a massive story. The idea that Google won't necessarily be the leader in self-driving cars is such a narrative-killer.https://twitter.com/theinformation/status/808540630578118656
808737559123619841 2016-12-13 18:17:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelwhitney @ggreeneva yeah, the idea that Bernie connected w/ppl better bc of his "digital media strategy" might be missing real story
808734520459411456 2016-12-13 18:05:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> I definitely admire this sentiment. Any journalist who aspires to valuing what's important vs what's popular -> something we should supporthttps://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/808721607367815168
808733444180099072 2016-12-13 18:00:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mekosoff that's awesome. Doesn't surprise me from WSJ and WaPo.
808733256883412993 2016-12-13 18:00:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mekosoff There are 10 imp stories running every day now, but media often gravitates to shiny BS story. I admire Kurt for resisting that.
808732751708860417 2016-12-13 17:58:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mekosoff There is so much news right now that really matters to the future of the country that Kanye is objectively a nothing story by comp
808732478089269249 2016-12-13 17:57:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mekosoff ...(which is near-meaningless) to distract from > imp issues. Journalists need to work hard to counterbalance this manipulation
808732324359569408 2016-12-13 17:56:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mekosoff I respect your POV, but disagree with your priorities. Trump is purposefully serving up Kanye story...
808730774102908928 2016-12-13 17:50:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mekosoff I think it's terrific that Kurt even aspires to this. Not spending time on Kanye is type of decision we want journalists making
808727176224702464 2016-12-13 17:35:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm starting to get the impression that there aren't strong barriers to entry in the multi-person mobile video call markethttps://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/808726619305046016
808724980946960385 2016-12-13 17:27:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol Bill - why do you think the Heritage cares about this issue? I'm asking as a centrist who often agrees w/Heritage, but not here
808722642320519168 2016-12-13 17:17:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshuaforman maybe. It's pretty tricky bc there's so little time. Earnest's response at the press conference was needed, at a minimum.
808721774951088128 2016-12-13 17:14:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshuaforman And to be clear, after my tweet, the WH did respond - http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/12/politics/white-house-suggests-trump-benefitted-from-russia-hacking/
808721735595880448 2016-12-13 17:14:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshuaforman But there's a live debate going on in which DT, his team, & several Senators are being vocal. Silence by Obama/WH seems weak
808718754821513216 2016-12-13 17:02:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is funny. 2017 is pretty latehttps://twitter.com/recode/status/808718475812188160
808718002250072064 2016-12-13 16:59:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois Sounds maybe treasonous - Giuliani + others
808717873656905728 2016-12-13 16:59:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois Vote wasn't hacked. Main charge: Trump team/RG (possibly w DT in loop) were in direct comms w WL & Russia re hacking
808716472948137984 2016-12-13 16:53:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois The WH subsequently spoke out:https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/12/12/politics/white-house-suggests-trump-benefitted-from-russia-hacking/index.html
808712825413636097 2016-12-13 16:38:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> Why is it important that the President's holiday card say Merry Christmas when so many people don't celebrate Xmas?
808712587298762752 2016-12-13 16:38:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> Fox News & others on right are OK w/a non-inclusive cultural tone that makes POCs & other non-W backgrounds feel different & uncomfortable
808712165880279040 2016-12-13 16:36:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Although hardly our biggest problem, the right's obsession with saying Merry Christmas is really despicablehttps://twitter.com/nypost/status/808677023518486528
808540826867380224 2016-12-12 05:15:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> There is a consensus emerging that Rick Perry is not as stupid as I had thoughthttps://twitter.com/trumwill/status/808533850204803072
808538230890971136 2016-12-12 05:05:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @triketora are you saying that a vanity fair story wasn't very insightful
808533699385905152 2016-12-12 04:47:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin @trumwill but do you think he has the basic brainpower needed to do a job like this?
808532384035389440 2016-12-12 04:41:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> I thought the problem with Perry is that he's a dope, not that he's inexperiencedhttps://twitter.com/trumwill/status/808527582681583618
808531118777479168 2016-12-12 04:36:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PhilipRucker Exxon was/is a consulting client of Rice Hadley Gates - right?
808470961745858560 2016-12-12 00:37:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Understanding Trump/Bannon's strategy & motives is hard work; isn't that the type of subject the Times is supposed to help us understand?
808454411122937856 2016-12-12 23:32:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> Maybe @peterbakernyt (joining the NYT WH beat soon) will make things better - he'll need a lot more guts than we've seen so far
808452256739704844 2016-12-12 23:23:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> The contrast with the Washington Post is brutal. Their reporters have high integrity and a willingness to speak truth to power.
808451727196233728 2016-12-12 23:21:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> My impression is that @mikiebarb may be the only NYTimes reporter covering Trump/the election who has a working moral compass
808447544883757056 2016-12-12 23:04:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hey @nickconfessore - is Trump gaslighting or not? That's more interesting than jokes.
808446474006589440 2016-12-12 23:00:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Are we readers supposed to "lighten up Francis" because it's all in good fun?
808446238991355904 2016-12-12 22:59:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> NYTimes reporter tweeting he doesn't know what gaslighting means (even as joke) is good representation of the NYT's cynical moral bankruptcy
808445015391289344 2016-12-12 22:54:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> I would support a Teen Vogue editorial hostile takeover of the New York Timeshttps://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/808442267878957056
808444437751742466 2016-12-12 22:52:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nickconfessore @amyewalter the teen vogue op-ed explains it well. You could read that instead of tweeting that you don't know what it means
808439898101321729 2016-12-12 22:34:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> If I'm looking for Reddit but with more freedom, it's hard to pick between Voat and Gab.

808434865834115072 2016-12-12 22:14:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> We will need to count on leaders whose reelection prospects aren't tied to Trump's blessing - that's Graham and McCain.https://twitter.com/blakehounshell/status/808434604063518720

808383656163053568 2016-12-12 18:50:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> The fact that most Republican leadership prefers Pence is a vulnerability for Trumphttps://twitter.com/peter_wehner/status/808383143610896385
808377835739955200 2016-12-12 18:27:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy mm. Yeah these are costs, but I don't think they can stay silent.
808376202658357248 2016-12-12 18:21:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm trying to figure out a tolerable rationale for Obama and Biden staying silent on the Russia stuff. Open to suggestions.
808374424080482305 2016-12-12 18:14:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> I find it almost impossible to talk about something on Twitter other than Trump. Which is mostly fine, but sometimes it's a bummer

808100825675374592 2016-12-11 00:07:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sknthla how we will deal with jobs when automation keeps eliminating categories (driving, cashiers, etc.) - that seems like the big one
808056823014006784 2016-12-11 21:12:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sarahcuda as someone who cares about iPhone encryption, I appreciate Cook not treating Trump with full-blown hostility
808056296675176448 2016-12-11 21:10:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> The Apple "Open Your Heart to Everyone" ad is a direct rebuke to Trump & his intolerant followershttps://twitter.com/vaitersn/status/801912638443638784

805868019607949312 2016-12-05 20:14:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> The idea of Pizzagate is so pathetic and stupid. Plus it's super-depressing that the NSC advisor-elect RTd something about it.

805501074509594624 2016-12-04 19:56:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Problem isn't Trump has narcissistic personality disorder (all presidents do). Real issue: it wasn't in his political interest to conceal it https://twitter.com/sarajbenincasa/status/805393954468302848
805498167986966528 2016-12-04 19:45:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sriramk I guess I'm pretty open to whatever a creator wants to do as long as the universe seems very real / not forced

805496052082245632 2016-12-04 19:36:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jmohsenin I watch all media for stimulation
805495248151527424 2016-12-04 19:33:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sriramk yeah that's true but I don't begrudge the creators for doing their thing
805494473379692544 2016-12-04 19:30:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's politically incorrect to criticize Westworld, & I do admire the ambitiousness. But I don't feel myself getting smarter when I watch it.
805494035112751104 2016-12-04 19:28:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> Westworld's uber-themes are dull. What if the robots become sentient, etc. Like Ex Machina minus 20 IQ points.
805493636125327360 2016-12-04 19:27:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> Westworld = R-rated Disneyland version of what an AI world might feel like. I'd guess the creators don't understand or even like technology.
805491426675085312 2016-12-04 19:18:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> Black Mirror = authentic effort by creative people who have feel for technology to imagine how it changes ppl & society; Westworld is not

804746117879513089 2016-12-02 17:56:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans oh yeah to be clear I'm not disagreeing w your profitability point, so maybe I'm derailing this conversation
804745929894948864 2016-12-02 17:55:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans sure, but I think they'd raise prices somewhat in a world where they really have no competition.
804745035690323972 2016-12-02 17:52:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans not yet. Walmart, Costco, etc. If those folks go away then yeah I think Amazon will jack up prices too.
804743736232013824 2016-12-02 17:47:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Disagree. Amazon competes in fiercely competitive retail industry. Uber is building a true monopoly, or - at worst -the leading oligopolist.https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/804736226141949952

804582299635302400 2016-12-01 07:05:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @msquinn @mcgd @stevesi @mgsiegler this is crazy. Jobs, Zuck, CCox, JIve, Page - all used their products actively vs. 146 tweets

804580578695725056 2016-12-01 06:58:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @msquinn @mcgd @stevesi @mgsiegler And yeah, I think you need to tweet actively to understand a lot about the service

804093019787886592 2016-11-30 22:41:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump doesn't care about embarrassing himself w elites, nor does it cost him politically. His base loves the craziness & trolling.https://twitter.com/ananavarro/status/803426269434171392

803689040113344512 2016-11-29 19:56:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @OkazuYuri Trump wants to be reelected, doesn't want another Mideast war, & wants to look tough on terrorism. Petraeus is our best hope.
803684792705241088 2016-11-29 19:39:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @OkazuYuri Petraeus is v thoughtful re how conflict affects other cultures & societies. He's great guy to manage anti-terrorism efforts
803683510250704896 2016-11-29 19:34:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> All of you ranting about emails - you are looking a gift horse in the mouth. Focus on other things 8/8
803683451811442688 2016-11-29 19:34:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> So... who cares about Petraeus's emails? He made a (big) mistake. Now we need him again 7/7
803683116913070080 2016-11-29 19:32:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> A leader like Petraeus is our best shot at keeping us out of crazy wars and avoiding crazy overreactions 6/6
803682999610970112 2016-11-29 19:32:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump's promises during the campaign make it seem like he will play right into the hands of terrorists 5/x
803682913610907648 2016-11-29 19:31:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Petraeus is thoughtful and very knowledgeable about Middle East conflict 4/x
803682803367804928 2016-11-29 19:31:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> Petraeus as Secretary of State would be the best thing that's happened to the United States since the election 3/x
803682673692508160 2016-11-29 19:30:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Our incoming CINC has zero foreign policy experience and a volatile, vengeful temperament. He also thinks he knows everything 2/x
803682453772587008 2016-11-29 19:30:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> I strongly opposed Trump, but all this handwringing on Twitter about Petraeus/email is really missing the big picture 1/xhttps://twitter.com/danpfeiffer/status/803388237972545536

803664056502534144 2016-11-29 18:16:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @cjwerleman it's because Trump's base cares about guns, not free speech

803487130525630464 2016-11-28 06:33:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @doog I think they value access to Trump and his people; also they worry about alienating Trump supporters

803481275755413505 2016-11-28 06:10:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @doog NYT is struggling to stay on a truth/journalism-integrity line. It's clear that there are strong incentives to please/placate Trump.

803455515091083264 2016-11-28 04:28:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> The Post is backed by Bezos; its independence & fearlessness seems to reflect that 5/x

803454396419874816 2016-11-28 04:23:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> I assume the same is true about the rest of the TV news networks 3/x
803454288445906944 2016-11-28 04:23:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> CNN and NBC are coin-operated and audience obsessed - addicted to conflict and Trump access 2/x
803453825440882688 2016-11-28 04:21:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> I've been thinking more lately that the Washington Post may be our only hope for strong adversarial reporting within the MSM community 1/x
803452465488109568 2016-11-28 04:16:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mgsiegler I want you to know that people seem more interested in my Trump-related tweets than my insights about sports
803422033098915840 2016-11-28 02:15:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> Right, Trump didn't care about the emails; he just wanted to win.  Petraeus is ++ better vs Newt, Rudy & Mike Flynn. Stay focused on that.https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer/status/803388237972545536

803339972933664768 2016-11-28 20:49:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @aravosis yeah could be. Flynn seems terrible. But Petraeus seems like he would be strong / try to do what's right / say no
803339774517837824 2016-11-28 20:48:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @aravosis I'm under impression he did good job leading 2 wars & he has sophisticated worldview re intersection of military/politics/social

803309437293236226 2016-11-28 18:47:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @aravosis John I don't see problem. Yes Petraeus made big mistake, but how can we do better than Petraeus? Wouldn't he be great for country?
803297883654979584 2016-11-28 18:01:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> To be clear: - It's 100% reasonable Trump is taking time on SoS search - He's surfaced v good candidates - There's no point in being snarkyhttps://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/803297225623252994
803293813196267520 2016-11-28 17:45:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> If Petraeus gets job, would be real check on crazy/terrible Mike Flynn. Reasonable chance that Flynn will be forced out within 12-18 months.
803290904169615361 2016-11-28 17:34:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JesseDorogusker yep, I myself couldn't care less! I'd feel much better if he was in administration. So much better vs Rudy or even Romney
803290235987587072 2016-11-28 17:31:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's interesting that no one on Twitter is calling out the obvious - that BuzzFeed News is bleeding peoplehttps://twitter.com/mckaycoppins/status/803268069514571776

801220690871357440 2016-11-22 00:27:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tylercowen @millsbaker @annekate I doubt extended childcare explains away most lack of moving

801151083015852032 2016-11-22 19:51:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @millsbaker yes totally agree
801150925716918272 2016-11-22 19:50:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Think about the risks taken by European, Latino and Asian immigrants. Anything intra-US pales by comparison.
801150774805860352 2016-11-22 19:50:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @millsbaker yeah, it's somewhat inexplicable why people don't move more. @tylercowen has written about this.

801111674497351680 2016-11-22 17:14:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> To be clear: this will all work best (for Trump) if independent-looking prosecutor type decides pursuing Hillary is right thing to do (7/7)
801111408746188800 2016-11-22 17:13:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Of Trump's major promises, prosecuting Hillary seems among the cheapest to implement (6/x)
801111064536436736 2016-11-22 17:12:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think Bannon wants to go after Hillary; it's basically free entertainment for Trump base - the circus part of bread and circuses (5/x)
801110637757632513 2016-11-22 17:10:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ultimately AG & Justice Dept will make decision. And Trump can claim that Justice is acting independently based on evidence (4/x)
801110190737092608 2016-11-22 17:08:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump never feels bound by what his surrogates say, and often contradicts or ignores them (3/x)
801109943516471296 2016-11-22 17:07:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> If Bannon etc. want to go after Hillary, they need Obama not to pardon her (2/x)

800107969912262656 2016-11-19 22:46:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> Interesting point. But there's a tradeoff - flood of fake news crowds out valuable info. All debunking/all-the-time not good for readers.https://twitter.com/rabois/status/800105743554854912
800103580128706560 2016-11-19 22:28:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump's deal w MSM: it's OK to be negative sometimes (cuz you gotta look like you have integrity; he gets it) but he expects niceness too!https://twitter.com/ericboehlert/status/800102706551656452
800080715207426050 2016-11-19 20:58:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> Fake news is the new cable TV ads. In 1988, Ailes ran targeted racist spots on cable TV, but no one outside of those states knew about themhttps://twitter.com/KaraCalavera/status/800080175216160768
800063568825585664 2016-11-19 19:49:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattdpearce @IanJDickson fundamentally Trump's reelection prospects come down to how the economy is doing in 2020. Everything else is noise
800063297722515456 2016-11-19 19:48:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattdpearce @IanJDickson IMO he's objectively right. If economy sucks in 2020, Trump'll get hammered & self-enrichment will make this worse
800052988517548032 2016-11-19 19:07:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> There's no evidence this is even remotely important to Trump's votershttps://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/799764126603956226
800035696958263296 2016-11-19 17:59:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> That doesn't mean lay down your arms, but it does argue for picking our spots and not rising to Bannon's bait
800035227947020289 2016-11-19 17:57:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> We need to come to grips w/reality that Trump's base & center don't agree with elites abt the importance of social/cultural/tolerance issues
800018539562160128 2016-11-19 16:50:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ayiyi this Hamilton stuff. Not helping. Bannon and Trump *want* the culture war (elites v all others) center stage.
800015413383790592 2016-11-19 16:38:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's gotten to the point that iOS dictation is more accurate than autocorrect, which is ridiculous
800015298107580416 2016-11-19 16:38:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> Apple should invest some of its precious ML resources making autocorrect better (and more personalized)
800015112828370944 2016-11-19 16:37:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> The only part of the mobile writing experience that isn't improving is autocorrect
799875392009973760 2016-11-18 07:22:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think he posted it as soon as he was ready to say it and doesn't care about timinghttps://twitter.com/anildash/status/799874847178362880

799813204259917824 2016-11-18 03:15:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> Translation: Trump and Flynn are setting us up for a bunch of no-impact noise and then will declare victory. Dumb people will be impressed.https://twitter.com/johnjharwood/status/756226475406352384
799812093599883264 2016-11-18 03:10:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoeNBC Nobody stopped him from watching. But they were right to express strongly that his view that LBGT is abnormal is not OK.
799810726579683328 2016-11-18 03:05:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BradMossEsq @RadioFreeTom what's your view on gay conversion therapy
799806365015228416 2016-11-18 02:47:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ditzkoff Dave I'm still working on "trying to engage." What am I missing - How is going to B'way show=engaging w opponents/opposing ideas?
799795862381608960 2016-11-18 02:06:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ditzkoff @jw yes this is exactly right
799795381236207616 2016-11-18 02:04:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoeNBC you should focus on this not Pence being booedhttps://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/799611041873281028
799794678140780544 2016-11-18 02:01:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Comical. How does going to Hamilton count as "trying to engage"? Pence is conversion therapy guy - there's no middle ground - LBGT or not.https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/799785529537679360

799682687120216064 2016-11-18 18:36:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Lets people consume and produce a lot more written work
799682604345782273 2016-11-18 18:36:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> Writing on mobile forces you to say more with fewer words & increases surface area of ideas

799293100266926080 2016-11-17 16:48:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pooter03 I'm making a different point - that Bannon is effective
799292347695538176 2016-11-17 16:45:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Bannon had a super-contrarian despicable universally hated approach that got results (3/3)

799124754300948480 2016-11-16 05:39:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sacca Cross fingers, I'm guessing that dopes like Rick Perry aren't going to be chosen. Trump lets names surface so that they are flattered
799123528595275778 2016-11-16 05:34:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @varadmehta Jared as advisor seems plausible/good as HRC & RFK were. Given Muslim registry surfaced today - cmon we gotta pick right fights
799119784914731008 2016-11-16 05:19:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is simply over-dramatic. JFK had Bobby. Bill had Hillary. This is type of handwringing that undermines credibility around real issues.https://twitter.com/varadmehta/status/799118972809572356

799113959987036160 2016-11-16 04:56:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Muslim registry - the type of thing we should focus on  Jared Kushner working in White House - the type of thing we shouldn't be focusing onhttps://twitter.com/blakehounshell/status/799099911723749377

798753923184017408 2016-11-15 05:05:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> TBC smart ppl I talk to are really worried. But it's hard to detect these signals thru haze of MSM non-stop dismay w/so things big & small.
798752656328040452 2016-11-15 05:00:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> It does seem like Trump's transition is super-problematic. OTOH, MSM coverage is so alarmist & negative, it's hard to take it seriously.
798687275680813056 2016-11-15 00:41:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't think it's crazy that Trump wants top-secret access for Ivanka and Jared. They were among his primary advisors during the campaign.
798615264992473088 2016-11-15 19:54:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois @artypapers also worth noting that gossip doesn't imply disinformation/wrong. Good gossip is accurate

798320155809845248 2016-11-14 00:22:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricRWeinstein @davealevine this seems unreasonably open-minded re Bannon. Minus DT patronage it wouldn't be difficult to characterize him
798317363326119936 2016-11-14 00:11:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EricRWeinstein @davealevine ...given that Bannon has a role of seemingly extraordinary power
798316211066912768 2016-11-14 00:06:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MariaTCardona very even handed headline
798315388773625860 2016-11-14 00:03:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @artypapers @annekate does Yik Yak count?
798312795276132352 2016-11-14 23:52:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @speechboy71 @Smart562 if acres of land could vote Trump would have crushed the popular vote
798290704782872576 2016-11-14 22:25:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonathanchait this seems like a scene in a movie right before nice couple is brutally murdered
798280803478212608 2016-11-14 21:45:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mcottle I was a Hillary supporter, but I feel like this election vindicated Susan Sarandon
798237424950222848 2016-11-14 18:53:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> Lots of language used -> "so and so replied to" etc.
798233781865807872 2016-11-14 18:38:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin yes you hear this from lots of folks
798232625789865987 2016-11-14 18:34:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> "Trump is doing something hypocritical" isn't good material for a tweet and yet accounts for 1/3 of my timeline
798063220539801601 2016-11-13 07:21:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> This has not been a good M&A few years for Bosehttps://twitter.com/techcrunch/status/798062831526522880
798046294044356608 2016-11-13 06:13:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion why B+ and not A
798026202426445824 2016-11-13 04:54:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hadip Asking about Bannon and his controversial background was a clear top 5 question on Friday
798025012275859456 2016-11-13 04:49:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rmayemsinger right, yep. But Trump was emphasizing the point that states can still legalize it even if the Court overturns Roe
798023888332435456 2016-11-13 04:44:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rmayemsinger idea is that states will decide, so some will legalize abortion and some won't
798023505375727616 2016-11-13 04:43:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy I'm pretty sure Bannon rumors were out there by the time the interview took place
798017862350684160 2016-11-13 04:20:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> .@LesleyRStahl didn't ask about Steve Bannon. Probably #1 tiny question this week. Weak performance.
798014749094969344 2016-11-13 04:08:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> Lesley Stahl was atrocious; this wasn't Mike Wallace. 60 Minutes has no leverage to ask hard questions - same problem everyone else has.
797977264075902976 2016-11-13 01:39:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kfury her political career is over, regardless
797975222460694528 2016-11-13 01:31:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshtpm @delong eh they all are. Access so desirable.
797974661480861696 2016-11-13 01:29:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kfury yes - Ford/Nixon
797972812744912896 2016-11-13 01:21:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think the Trump folks are playing dead re special prosecutor in the hopes of lulling Obama into not pardoning herhttps://twitter.com/lynnsweet/status/797957546388561920
797964147740659712 2016-11-13 00:47:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> Using WhatsApp makes you appreciate how bad iOS Contacts and iMessage are
797959576842702850 2016-11-13 00:29:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> There's a lot of stuff going on now when someone replies to a tweet
797895978581770241 2016-11-13 20:16:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't think this is right. Trump wants to maintain direct connection to voters to maximize leverage over Congress. Reagan on steroids.https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/797893716228931584
797616908182769670 2016-11-12 01:47:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> There are too many platforms for chatting - Slack, FBM, WhatsApp, iMessage
797603990749884416 2016-11-12 00:56:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonfavs Jon - I wrote a pretty long answer about this on Quora -> https://www.quora.com/Now-that-Trump-has-won-will-the-Justice-Department-continue-to-pursue-and-prosecute-Hillary-Clinton-Will-she-end-up-in-jail/answer/Marc-Bodnick

797512081150873600 2016-11-12 18:51:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @balajis @rabois which new state will have the best weed
797207945595392001 2016-11-11 22:42:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> The problem w/parsing thru voter motives is that people who are hurting often prefer to attack/blame others vs revealing vulnerabilities
796965156676714496 2016-11-10 06:37:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> I want one platform (Spotify) because that's where my playlists are and it's where I browse and listen generally. (3/3)
796965027018194944 2016-11-10 06:37:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> I just don't want to listen to or organize music on a 2nd platform. I'm not interested in dealing with iTunes. (2/x)
796964866145685504 2016-11-10 06:36:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm not willing to buy an album on iTunes which isn't available on Spotify. (1/x)
796956331273961472 2016-11-10 06:02:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think he can pardon her preemptively without making charges a la Ford's pardon of Nixon
796954496689520640 2016-11-10 05:55:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is one of my better Quora answers.

796856726616096769 2016-11-10 23:27:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> I've reached the point now where I often prefer writing on my iPhone to my laptop (3/3)
796856288957206528 2016-11-10 23:25:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> Apple's continuing small improvements plus those of iOS developers make the writing experience on iOS better and better (2/x)
796856115103350784 2016-11-10 23:24:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> Apple gets a lot of criticism but the iPhone 7 Plus is a pretty incredible computer (1/x)
796786646851063809 2016-11-10 18:48:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> It seems like the thing the media most missed was the lack of enthusiasm for Hillary / the huge turnout gaphttps://twitter.com/paulwaldman1/status/796786262359347201
796752657629134848 2016-11-10 16:33:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Having the right founder seems as important as executing a great idea well. Tumblr is a good example of this - could have been huge.
796591161003556864 2016-11-09 05:51:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> The single most important thing we want to achieve is for Donald Trump to be a one-term president
796526725983150080 2016-11-09 01:35:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @can I'm pretty defeatist about MSM. Business model(s) look terminal.
796526407874551808 2016-11-09 01:34:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @can What I'm saying is that deep private pockets from a wealthy hero owner not focused on near term profit may be our best hope
796526168283365376 2016-11-09 01:33:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @can The Post was gutsiest, most independent outlet in MSM this cycle, bar none. I attribute that to Bezos intentions & fin independence
796525355959918592 2016-11-09 01:30:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT @can how is Bezos=govt
796525101550141441 2016-11-09 01:29:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Jeff Bezos owning the Post is the sole light of hope in mediahttps://twitter.com/maggienyt/status/796429287167557638
796512939532578816 2016-11-09 00:40:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Will_deF @pbreit yep, I agree somewhat
796484349608628224 2016-11-09 22:47:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> Random gossip: Trump probably will move embassy to Jerusalem.
796456514810544128 2016-11-09 20:56:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @abhinavsharma How do you think about Google in this context? They work against clickbait. Ditto Quora.
796451083480547328 2016-11-09 20:35:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allenmhc unclear
796450480935215104 2016-11-09 20:32:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Put another way, the tension between popularity and quality has never been higher (6/6)
796450218166218752 2016-11-09 20:31:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> If anything social media magnifies the power of viral engagement/popularity - rewarding crappy content with a high drama/wow factor (5/x)
796449886048636928 2016-11-09 20:30:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> By and large, the revolution in distribution systems (FB, Twitter) has not been accompanied by big improvements to quality (4/x)
796449422938750977 2016-11-09 20:28:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> And staying up-to-date, up to the minute is maybe overrated -- especially if a lot of your info is coming from MSM (3/x)
796449194026233856 2016-11-09 20:27:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hot takes aren't so nourishing if they are wrong or a total waste of time (2/x)
796449040971874304 2016-11-09 20:27:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> Obviously this isn't our biggest problem, but jeez our media information system feels very broken (1/x)
796443381501071360 2016-11-09 20:04:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Worth reading.https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/796443117973106688

796088781644251137 2016-11-08 20:35:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maddow @annekate Yep. He's like the type of leader/elite you dream about in a book (like a Dan Brown character), but rarely see in the wild
796088452777320448 2016-11-08 20:34:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jasontm @annekate It's more appealing/simpler to blame others (Mexico, elites, Congress, China) vs emphasize self-improvement
796088238926508032 2016-11-08 20:33:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PatrickRuffini I think this time is dif bc (1) so many other players are on IR and (2) Trump support/Trump base will be so important in '20
796088013985955840 2016-11-08 20:32:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker Yeah, among politicians, only Obama himself comes off as such a modern feminist
796087535789219840 2016-11-08 20:30:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Mike Pence is optimally positioned for 2020. Hard-conservative + super-loyal Trump guy. Watch how he positions himself over next couple days
796086896845799426 2016-11-08 20:28:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Carniphage right, I don't mean 2b specific. Just pointing out free-college idea=only major policy proposal referencing education this cycle
796086287019032576 2016-11-08 20:25:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Tim Kaine has been an awesome role model for boys and girls - he goes out of his way to call-out the importance of a man working for a womanhttps://twitter.com/timkaine/status/795978916045451265
796081273764597760 2016-11-08 20:05:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Other than that, it's difficult to think of an education vision/policy/idea that any candidate prioritized. We need to do better. (4/4)
796081063592214528 2016-11-08 20:04:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> But because it was the one idea focused on education & self-improvement which achieved above-the-fold attention (3/x)
796080863926587392 2016-11-08 20:04:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> Bernie's free college proposal may have been the most important idea this cycle, not because it made sense, but... (2/x)
796080417333911552 2016-11-08 20:02:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> We gotta figure out how to drive more economic mobility, or else we'll be stuck in this white nationalism loop for a while (1/x)
796076219183661056 2016-11-08 19:45:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> The next week could be awesome. Now that media doesn't need access to Trump & his henchmen, reporters are going to come out guns blazing.https://twitter.com/molly_knight/status/796073430760075265
796075573319565312 2016-11-08 19:43:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> I need this video - @molly_knight reply back if see it onlinehttps://twitter.com/molly_knight/status/796073430760075265
796066431523655680 2016-11-08 19:06:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine Tiffany and Barron are civilians; the rest fascists
796062311223992320 2016-11-08 18:50:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is absolute BS. Eric and Donald Jr were key henchmen a la Nuremberg perps.https://twitter.com/brauneyz/status/796062018272829442
796055849965735936 2016-11-08 18:24:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> "We blew it"=wrong. Problem is TV news which - Dominates print - Loves drama - Skew super-old (65+); Fox skews super GOP - Has no integrityhttps://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/796018613262188544
796050302289907713 2016-11-08 18:02:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @crampell I think this is economic anxiety
796049445322244096 2016-11-08 17:59:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Rudy currently has a narrow early leadhttps://twitter.com/marcbodnick/status/796044500938297344
796045692930138112 2016-11-08 17:44:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davemorin yeah, although until FBI/Comey thing, I think Hannity had a more sinister impact. Overall (ie incl pre-15/16) answer may be Ailes
796044500938297344 2016-11-08 17:39:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Who should be sent to the deepest ring of hell?
796044076462153730 2016-11-08 17:37:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Yonat_a you gotta choose; no indifference or nihilism allowed in my Twitter polls
796043073625071616 2016-11-08 17:33:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> You gotta vote - no moral equivalence allowed in my Twitter pollshttps://twitter.com/sarahcuda/status/796042904955285504
796041258900721664 2016-11-08 17:26:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Austan_Goolsbee I've been wrestling w whether Uday/Qusay is the way to go vs Fredo and Sonny. It's hard bc Sonny had some good qualities
796040599933591552 2016-11-08 17:24:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> To be clear, my vote is for Eric. Donald Jr is more venal but that's not the poll.
796039843956408320 2016-11-08 17:21:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> Dumber Trump
796038040049156096 2016-11-08 17:13:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kurteichenwald @delong Irony is conspiracy *supporting* Trump is Ludlum-esque: Russia, Wikileaks, Fox/Comcast, neo-Nazis, Christian Right
796031752573632516 2016-11-08 16:48:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> That's because your party made us all incur a 15% risk of turning our country over to a fascist https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/796031113449897984

795865834644086784 2016-11-07 05:49:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Massive focus emailgate received reflects 1/deep cultural misogyny & 2/MSM interest in promoting GOP manuf'd attacks; eg Swift Boating (3/3)
795864961809457152 2016-11-07 05:46:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> Email scandal reflected some bad judgement, although v modestly in context of 1/Trump's infinite problems & 2/GOP presidential scandal (2/x)

795817162413719552 2016-11-07 02:36:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> Worst candidate ever for - Women - African Americans - Immigrants - Latinos - Native Americans - LBGT - Jews - Disabledhttps://twitter.com/gideonresnick/status/795816081168461825

795773361578078208 2016-11-07 23:42:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin yeah I hear you. Many people feel this way.
795772635497934848 2016-11-07 23:39:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Focusing on 1 state seems like way to go - apply ton of political focus & ec resources to get traction in a small market, then expand (4/4)
795772390126993408 2016-11-07 23:38:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> We can't go another 4 yrs w/o feeling strong sense of progress that things will get better for those without knowledge industry skills (3/x)

794237475984052224 2016-11-03 17:59:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> Having lots of women & African-American talking heads is an attempt by networks to throw us off the scent and conceal racism/misogyny (6/6)
794237113361235968 2016-11-03 17:57:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is confusing because many TV hosts look young and mainstream - that's a trick (4/4)
794236916849774593 2016-11-03 17:56:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> But the TV watchers are disproportionately older (over 65?) and more likely to be misogynist & racist. (3/x)
794236645536972802 2016-11-03 17:55:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> People who are educated take advantage of many news options and are less reliant on TV (2/x)
794236399943753728 2016-11-03 17:54:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> I have a theory why the TV networks are so pro-Trump and so sympathetic to Republicans, racists and misogynists (1/x)

793988512596955136 2016-11-02 01:29:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> Many stakeholders want to avoid this topic. GOP ldrs need racist vote; media (eg CNN) can't have horserace when 1 candidate=fascist (3/x)

793959006809243648 2016-11-02 23:32:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin I think it depends how close the election is. If it's a blowout, Sam Wang may be in vogue, but it's hard to know. Maybe nobody.

793958255475052544 2016-11-02 23:29:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's not his fault, but the "fun" headlines seeking clicks aren't confidence inducing. You don't see @SamWangPhD delighting in drama, etc.
793955820341821440 2016-11-02 23:19:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> Nate Silver has lost credibility. V difficult to sort devotion to data science/evidence vs desire to boost traffic. He's like a high-end CNNhttps://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/793955343772614656

793302041145675776 2016-10-31 04:02:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> We shouldn't speculate about a Russian Trump sex tape until we have more facts

793165508124090369 2016-10-31 18:59:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @artypapers this is a pretty friendly interpretation
793121369860952064 2016-10-31 16:04:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sarahmquinlan how about relative to her opponent

793117817163833344 2016-10-31 15:49:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EWErickson why do you say that? Your logic makes no sense if we stipulate that Trump is a fascist whose presidency would be a catastrophe
793116905989021696 2016-10-31 15:46:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is just a rationalization to: - Socialize Trump's lies - Make Trump supporters seem non-stupidhttps://twitter.com/erikwemple/status/793114947655917568

791850402782130176 2016-10-27 03:53:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Many GOP leaders are good people, but a disturbing # (eg Kirk, Gingrich, Trump, Pence, etc) are despicable misogynists/racists/anti-LGBThttps://twitter.com/mikedebonis/status/791836619602927616
791843772195758080 2016-10-27 03:27:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> This interview was as bad as Matt Lauer softball night. @GStephanopoulos is just a more serious-looking @jimmyfallon. No tough questions.https://twitter.com/TheFix/status/791644726705479680
791842006653804545 2016-10-27 03:20:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT Trump has encouraged followers to show up to polling stations & harass African-American voters. That's the suppression campaign.
791837008029102080 2016-10-27 03:00:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @whsahhar "content is not available"

791774055309291520 2016-10-27 22:50:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman "slightly less than explicit"= dogwhistle - how to get away w/voter suppression. Parsing Trump language is a waste of time
791773623610585088 2016-10-27 22:48:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> This may be too skeptical https://www.quora.com/What-is-GM%E2%80%99s-new-Voice-First-Watson-OnStar-Go-and-why-is-it-important/answer/Marc-Bodnick
791771381054582784 2016-10-27 22:39:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NoahCRothman Trump has been explicit about asking his supporters to take action to suppress/discourage African-American voters - no?
791770119575789568 2016-10-27 22:34:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> "Clearly true"? You can't be serious. Trump has repeatedly encouraged supporters to go to polling stations & intimidate African-Americans.https://twitter.com/noahcrothman/status/791769328383356928

791739713375772672 2016-10-27 20:33:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Obama by contrast=leader trying to do right thing in world where problems are complex;Iran deal & TPP are easy to demagogue, hard to explain
791739246679764996 2016-10-27 20:32:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> Public Trump is the stupidest and most cynical character who has rise to power in my lifetime
791738880378613760 2016-10-27 20:30:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Obama answers TPP questions w/nuance & complexity - reading this makes me nauseated at how Trump has debased intellectual quality of debatehttps://twitter.com/nadsinger/status/791734959731937280

791735692086812672 2016-10-27 20:17:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @theonesoleshoe if those ppl are opponent, rooting for trump = rooting for an incred sports team. The Michael Jordan of white nationalism
791735475631304704 2016-10-27 20:17:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @theonesoleshoe it was the big FU way Trump gave to elites, politicians, women, mexico, etc.
791702623099367424 2016-10-27 18:06:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> There is no justification for media coverage of Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. They are both jokes.https://twitter.com/jamie_weinstein/status/791695388554080257

791499915113271296 2016-10-26 04:40:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @WrightUps wrong question; right question is to ask Trump&surrogates why they aren't vociferously condemning bigots&racists among supporters
791497736474419200 2016-10-26 04:32:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @IlladelphAC @aravosis I agree; I wonder why Hillary surrogates haven't pushed this harder; eg @MartinOMalley Fox interview 2day was awesome
791494454678999041 2016-10-26 04:19:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion @MaxReiss eh this is partly true, but Rubio choked when he finally hit his window
791490143660060672 2016-10-26 04:02:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> .@MartinOMalley called Trump a fascist on Fox today - we need more of this
791489908414095360 2016-10-26 04:01:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't get why media doesn't press Trump harder to react to racism, misogyny & antisemitism among his supporters - at rallies & on Twitter
791485965625798657 2016-10-26 03:45:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Haha that's a cute way to look at it! Another interpretation: many people in the Trump coalition are bigots, racists and antisemiteshttps://twitter.com/karol/status/791485082422898688
791479652233596929 2016-10-26 03:20:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baseballcrank It's ridiculous to compare Hillary to Stalin. Really a dodge to imply they are roughly equal via any lens. He is a fascist.
791476030917652480 2016-10-26 03:06:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> How does Fox not fire this guy?https://twitter.com/loudobbs/status/790024160160411648
791475028600627201 2016-10-26 03:02:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> Exasperating that we need video (eg Billy Bush) to get everyone talking about Trump's misogyny. Without video Trump supporters can ignore.https://twitter.com/swin24/status/791469505268609025
791435962291060736 2016-10-26 00:26:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pourmecoffee I bet (no joke) that CNN does whatever it can to tighten its own polls. Jeff Zucker himself probably picks the numbers
791412284559982596 2016-10-26 22:52:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> If you are a parent you are harming your children by not warning them that these hosts prey on the intellectually weak with attractive lies
791411967629996032 2016-10-26 22:51:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> These guys (@rushlimbaugh @seanhannity @WalshFreedom @RealAlexJones) profit by degrading the intellect & confirming hate of their listeners
791410775462023168 2016-10-26 22:46:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> With @SykesCharlie hanging it up, which conservative talk show hosts aren't systematically focused on making their listeners dumber? https://twitter.com/colincampbell/status/791408127807721472

791325240613666817 2016-10-26 17:06:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jedmund yep. Can you follow me?
791324863797481473 2016-10-26 17:05:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jedmund definitely invite me!
791323929679761408 2016-10-26 17:01:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jedmund curious - do you find Twitter is a good place to have conversations about topics like this?
791322105199468544 2016-10-26 16:54:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jedmund to me looks like a bit of a mess with every product being outperformed by a leader
791321881190084608 2016-10-26 16:53:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jedmund OK; your optimism has my attention

791305391162269696 2016-10-26 15:48:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Chris_arnade more fun to say "populists" than "backward racists"
791305046642216960 2016-10-26 15:46:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshuabrustein @juno @Uber @BradStone @serogers72 For me as customer, it comes down to fast availability & price. Everything else=gravy.
791303788078301184 2016-10-26 15:41:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jasommer I hear you. IMO what riders care about is liquidity & price. Clean cars & basic safety=table stakes, but ROI beyond that seems low
791302469653401600 2016-10-26 15:36:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Feels like "out-Lyft Lyft"- not promising. Insane focus on riders (Uber)=way more important vs driver focus. Esp w/autonomous driving cominghttps://twitter.com/BradStone/status/791301133985808384
791299371635576832 2016-10-26 15:24:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo well, the idea of disrupting Verizon/Comcast=very exciting, & GOOG obv benefits broadly from massively improving internet acess
791298902943080449 2016-10-26 15:22:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> The US politics community on TWTR is about 2000 people, mostly journalists. If you follow everyone (not hard), you'll see all conversations
791295681352732672 2016-10-26 15:09:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> Although CNN is not much better for journalism. Given her leverage, I'd bargain strongly for as much editorial independence as possible.
791295340259389440 2016-10-26 15:08:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> If she has Cronkite-like aspirations, she can't achieve them at Fox, where there's so much pressure to conform to an ideological agenda
791294524353949697 2016-10-26 15:04:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'd bet @megynkelly will be at different network next yr - either CNN or another network who'll hire her as tentpole star to build around
791163541323714560 2016-10-25 06:24:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> I have a different theory. They know that if Trump loses they will be pariahs.https://twitter.com/benhowe/status/791130299182772224
791162477585244160 2016-10-25 06:20:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> Only explanation: he's a misogynist & thought he could bully her. (2/2)
791162364200640512 2016-10-25 06:19:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> Makes no sense @newtgingrich blew up @megynkelly. She's on home team (Fox); he could've BS'd his way thru interview (1/2)
791047898737762305 2016-10-25 22:44:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EliStokols both versions are lies, right?
791047472760049664 2016-10-25 22:43:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias @whsahhar tech implies exponential growth opportunity
791046490542047233 2016-10-25 22:39:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KellyannePolls @wolfblitzer @joshrogin how about also asking him to discourage antisemitism at rallies & on Twitter? That would be great.
791043082930102272 2016-10-25 22:25:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Kantrowitz who is Betaville? Are they credible?
791040009969074177 2016-10-25 22:13:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Uh, this makes me wonder whether the whole technology product thing might be running out of gas under the Cook administrationhttps://twitter.com/variety/status/791034887654420480
791034037267681280 2016-10-25 21:49:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KBAndersen @pooter03 his supporters also say they don't care re pussy-grabbing. But it's different when an issue becomes mainstream TV news
791032165127507968 2016-10-25 21:42:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KBAndersen @pooter03 yeah, right. But this lack of self-funding feels like a fundamental betrayal to his base / breaking a major promise
791031444881612800 2016-10-25 21:39:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> The bait & switch of Trump not funding his own campaign feels like one of the big stories this cycle that the media hasn't pushed enough onhttps://twitter.com/KBAndersen/status/791030988604407808
791030986972594176 2016-10-25 21:37:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kfury Are there ppl you follow on TWTR from industry (like you) who tweet smart things about Apple? Not bloggers like @gruber.
791029309062340608 2016-10-25 21:30:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kfury curious, who do you find interesting on Twitter re: Apple products & news -> I'm particularly interested in non-journalists

790771572915118080 2016-10-24 04:26:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianstelter @davepell Trump base doesn't care about reality and will believe anything. They get told lies by Trump himself.

790745178973745152 2016-10-24 02:41:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> When the election's over, Silicon Valley should ostracize anyone who worked for the Trump campaign - they should not be made to feel welcome
790743611927203842 2016-10-24 02:35:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> Especially for the women who accused Trump of sexual assaulthttps://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/790743434495680512
790743352664739844 2016-10-24 02:34:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans cars and heads-up displays seem like frontrunners; probably wrong though
790743095180533760 2016-10-24 02:33:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @speechboy71 @rowast where is your empathy
790738058723201024 2016-10-24 02:13:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @drewdil not sure you and Hannity agreee on his interpretation of own
790737600067739648 2016-10-24 02:11:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @drewdil yes for sure. The guy kept leading with his chin.
790727790073032704 2016-10-24 01:32:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> The man has gone through 4 campaign managers - 3 men, 1 womanhttps://twitter.com/danabashcnn/status/790716615029579776
790713865306648576 2016-10-24 00:37:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> tldr- we completely underestimated Trump in the primaries; we aren't going to make that mistake again; nobody will  know if we are wronghttps://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/790689564935458816
790712673478381568 2016-10-24 00:32:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Another vague/mildly misleading link from The Hill. As a power reader of politics content on Twitter, I'd be fine with @thehill going awayhttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/790698652201279488
790691648359411712 2016-10-24 23:09:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin I'm saying that you personally should give Jill Stein a look
790691527961870336 2016-10-24 23:08:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> (for this targeted group that we are supposed to empathize with)
790691259450920960 2016-10-24 23:07:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm also confused what explanation there is for supporting Trump over Bernie, other than racism
790690312599384064 2016-10-24 23:03:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Republican cries that we must have empathy for Trump voters have died down, but I remain confused about which GOP policies would help them
790684095709798401 2016-10-24 22:39:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @timkawakami along these lines I'm guessing that a high % of NFL fans are Trump supporters
790678062799069186 2016-10-24 22:15:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac I learned two things from this tweet
790675643579052032 2016-10-24 22:05:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AaronBlake @pooter03 You can't emphasize enough - if Trump wanted Kellyane doing something differently, it would happen
790675345586266112 2016-10-24 22:04:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @varadmehta @Heminator maybe we talk about whether this is remotely accurate just after we make sure the fascist isn't elected
790674363871666180 2016-10-24 22:00:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AaronBlake @pooter03 I think he & Kellyane have at least a tacit understanding of how this works; otherwise he'd rein her in a la DJT Jr
790674137467334656 2016-10-24 21:59:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AaronBlake e.g. Meathead base gets "we're winning" msg, while mainstream/college ed ppl (who consume news) get "we need to catch up." (3/3)
790673900803727360 2016-10-24 21:58:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AaronBlake I call this "IQ price discrimination." (2/x)
790673266859913216 2016-10-24 21:56:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AaronBlake I have theory that Trump/Kellyane are subdividing their audience & giving different messages tailored to each group (1/x)
790672427227291648 2016-10-24 21:52:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't understand the idea (pushed by alt-left journalists) that John Podesta should explain which Wikileaks emails are fake. Ridiculous.
790671881397374976 2016-10-24 21:50:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> Media creators will be forced to be as concise as possible - writers, movie/TV creators, musical artists (4/4)
790671599863160832 2016-10-24 21:49:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Making me wait through ads, filler, stuff I don't want - to get the stuff I do want -> anything that does this is going away (3/x)
790671476466655232 2016-10-24 21:49:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> Make me do as little work, with as little waiting as possible. (2/x)
790671439674298369 2016-10-24 21:48:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Shortness/concision=future of media. Show me as much as possible in as little possible time. (1/x)
790670034024615936 2016-10-24 21:43:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> I hadn't seen this old Trump tweet. This guy is worst misogynist celebrity I've come across in my lifetime.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/369439265446309888
790669680255967232 2016-10-24 21:41:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheBrandonMorse "we've given up hope"=wrong interpretation. "We don't think email stuff is bad" + "H is so much better than T" - accurate
790669148477022209 2016-10-24 21:39:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> whoahttps://twitter.com/yarotrof/status/790649422812160001
790667718252896256 2016-10-24 21:34:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @zeynep @pbreit I'm contrarian on this. Some1 broke into Podesta email; he's not obligated to explain which emails r accurate & which r not

790655041401004032 2016-10-24 20:43:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is an incredible tweetstorm - one of the best blog posts that I've read about U.S. politics during this cycle https://twitter.com/imillhiser/status/790649600403206144
790654621530267648 2016-10-24 20:42:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> Just discovered this - pretty cool https://twitter.com/imillhiser/status/764131195919724544
790649269132812288 2016-10-24 20:20:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericbradner @thefix @matthewjdowd I'm guessing CNN fixes their polls to make the race look tight.
790649093395623936 2016-10-24 20:20:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> Don't ppl think CNN probably biases polls to make race look tight? It wouldn't surprise me if results are decided ahead of time, tops down.https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/790648155700400130
790641216090173440 2016-10-24 19:48:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> This relationship between Kellyanne & Trump really is crazy. I hope GOP ostracizes her going forward to teach a lesson to fascist enablers.https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/790636909722759168
790633627608502272 2016-10-24 19:18:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> "I'm winning!" and "It's rigged!" - pick your favorite lie to rationalize the feeling you need validated
790632987926798336 2016-10-24 19:16:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allenmhc historically yes this is conv wisdom. Going forward I think it's less clear. Distribution arguably dominates other considerations.
790630854326300672 2016-10-24 19:07:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RobertFrost01 reasonable ppl can disagree. Many of us love tweetstorms and some of Twitter's most impressive experts post them frequently
790630627418578944 2016-10-24 19:06:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't see why this "I'm winning" thing is surprising. Fox told ppl in 2012 that Romney was winning until end. GOP voters believe anything.https://twitter.com/rosiegray/status/790630017420132352
790625380000378881 2016-10-24 18:45:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allenmhc can you say more?
790613033860993024 2016-10-24 17:56:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @emilyekins @SeanTrende incredible the 42% isn't higher
790612691698069504 2016-10-24 17:55:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @XENOCIDE15 I don't care much about Mark Penn's POV on the future of media :)
790610700246786048 2016-10-24 17:47:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang for me tweetstorms as is with all their flaws > blogging
790610378656845824 2016-10-24 17:46:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @XENOCIDE15 I don't agree. Many serious people have written tweetstorms
790610128789606400 2016-10-24 17:45:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @XENOCIDE15 who reads Medium comments?
790609390101405696 2016-10-24 17:42:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang I think it's become more than that
790600180349362176 2016-10-24 17:05:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jessiwrites @whsahhar but tools are susceptible to competition / commoditization over time
790599433012379649 2016-10-24 17:02:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang oh interesting! Can you DM me some examples?
790599337332109312 2016-10-24 17:02:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang disagree. Much easier for readers to have everything on Twitter
790599150903496704 2016-10-24 17:01:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jessiwrites @whsahhar consistent with my tool v network point
790598551038414848 2016-10-24 16:59:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang because all the distribution and comments are here
790590076296105984 2016-10-24 16:25:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> Supports thesis that Medium is a good tool but not necessarily a useful networkhttps://twitter.com/jessiwrites/status/790586579496689664
790589640960987136 2016-10-24 16:23:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sarahcuda OK fair. Just like a normal blog, except less personalization.
790589457510436864 2016-10-24 16:23:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> Sure good answer. Plus other good reasons (eg fancy editor/visuals). But if you r writing 4 general, engaged audience, Twitter=where it's at
790586301086961664 2016-10-24 16:10:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> Better distribution and commenting when you publish directly to Twitter
790586104835477504 2016-10-24 16:09:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't understand why you'd publish on Medium if you can break the thing up and publish as a tweetstorm
790585592664903680 2016-10-24 16:07:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro especially when many of your supporters are stupid

790583426499739648 2016-10-24 15:59:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> This guy would get fired as a social media writer - "the the" plus incorrect extra spacehttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/790534428942622721

790581917414400000 2016-10-24 15:53:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @petersterne @jayrosen_nyu @dangillmor Intense, complex thinking has gone in2 these deals. Pretty rare this gets exposed by media
790580867324227584 2016-10-24 15:49:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @petersterne @jayrosen_nyu @dangillmor General problem w M&A media analysis: reporters don't understand strategic rationale
790568659915673601 2016-10-24 15:00:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> This Hannity/Ben Sasse Twitter fight is a sign of what's to come in 2018/20. Hannity is a megaphone/spokesperson for Trump votershttps://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/789654430975164416
790558798754689024 2016-10-24 14:21:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @oliverdarcy IQ price discrimination: tell the base one thing; tell all others something else
790554999977676800 2016-10-24 14:06:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @owillis that's a smaller gap than I thought. I had read that Trump had 80% of all airtime. CNN must be the difference

790413568415969280 2016-10-23 04:44:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'd say about 5% of my timeline is filled with "Trump is a hypocrite" tweets. So boring.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/790412771351560192
790413026511814656 2016-10-23 04:42:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FiveThirtyEight these aren't startups in the sense that we talk about them in tech or other high-growth industries
790407224879263744 2016-10-23 04:19:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DailyInterLake @seanhannity @brithume @MrMarkHall No Brit Hume was at ABC and was solid back then
790405656243122176 2016-10-23 04:12:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> I have a vague recollection of @brithume having integrity a long time ago but now he works at an organization that employs @seanhannity https://twitter.com/brithume/status/790359007315845120
790396037164732416 2016-10-23 03:34:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Relentless media slog thru Clinton emails ignores 1-sidedness of exercise; revelations abt Trump Org inner workings would be bloodcurdling
790394411712512000 2016-10-23 03:28:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshtpm @TaylorEgly not wanting to know

790375829213618176 2016-10-23 02:14:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> Do iPhone 7 and/or iOS 10 users sometimes find that Twitter runs slowly?
790311815112634368 2016-10-23 21:59:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jakewk @devnag super small payments - I just don't see it.
790307294693117952 2016-10-23 21:41:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @devnag @Jakewk IMO media micropayment stuff seems like bullshit wishful thinking sci experiments. Maybe this is how media works on Elysium
790305986460258304 2016-10-23 21:36:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericries that's true, although prices would have to be v low, bc Twitter is where you can comparison shop (with most choices priced at 0)
790305561002647552 2016-10-23 21:35:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @devnag I'm talking about text commodifying. TV = different animal - more about entertainment than an alternative for serious interpretation
790305316147572736 2016-10-23 21:34:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jakewk @devnag yeah I don't believe in micropayments. Why should readers pay/tip? No incentive; suppliers happy to produce for free
790303134916579328 2016-10-23 21:25:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @devnag commentary/advocacy is also somewhat commoditizing and faces strong competition from free
790302111766487040 2016-10-23 21:21:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SopanDeb Nah, this is a tactic. IQ price discrimination - one message for smart people, another message for non-smart people
790301485657575424 2016-10-23 21:18:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @noahchestnut we'll see. I'm not convinced there is a profit-model for print that works.
790300559580332032 2016-10-23 21:15:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nwquah @benthompson @noahchestnut yeah zero bloggers w/near-zero overhead who charge small subscriptions - seems like a viable model
790300285671321600 2016-10-23 21:14:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @devnag I don't use dedicated mobile apps for news. I use Twitter
790299978484715520 2016-10-23 21:12:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Antonvuljaj not sure. I get it - req subscriptions feels fair/reasonable. But comp is too fierce. Long-term the industry is distressed
790299391277924352 2016-10-23 21:10:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's not fun to make this point on Twitter because so many of the best writers here work for subscription-model businesses
790299076315131904 2016-10-23 21:09:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Antonvuljaj I don't think news media products can work if they require me to pay for a subscription and sign in
790298793874817028 2016-10-23 21:08:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> There's too much commodification/similarity in media - and too much competition from free writers - to require sign-in for news content
790298516736266240 2016-10-23 21:07:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> Subscription sign-in models just don't work. It's too burdensome to sign in from mobilehttps://twitter.com/mathewi/status/789587354386391040
790296846560219136 2016-10-23 21:00:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias I wouldn't overthink this. Getting the rigged narrative turned into Trump-is-a-bad-loser is important and uncomplicated
790292595192717312 2016-10-23 20:43:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hiattb also, a great TV drama is simply a better media product than the 6-5 Chiefs playing the 3-8 Falcons for the Nth time
790292375423688704 2016-10-23 20:42:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hiattb I agree TV drama serials run against trend. But those are consumed on-demand. Also 40-60 min eps are more digestible than 3-hr games
790291901777707008 2016-10-23 20:40:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Yeah TV events & news are often so much better watched as online highlights
790291524260999168 2016-10-23 20:39:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> In particular, if your team isn't winning/in playoff contention - there are simply better things to do with your time
790291115421216769 2016-10-23 20:37:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine @gaberivera it's worth noting: news is popular (in part) b/c it's inherently enjoyable & fresh - not just b/c it's convenient
790289533539463168 2016-10-23 20:31:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> TV sports is arguably boring & repetitive - same thing over and over. While entertainment & media alternatives improve, sports stays static
790288417816850432 2016-10-23 20:26:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> Everything in media is migrating to shorter/more personalized content. 3+ hour sporting events chock full of breaks & ads go against thishttps://twitter.com/garretthaake/status/790257084449173504
790271311033487360 2016-10-23 19:18:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> So despite underlying forces supporting Trump not going away post-2016, I'm skeptical we'll see this toxic Haley's Comet again in 2020 (4/4)
790270547825274881 2016-10-23 19:15:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Only a super-charismatic leader like Trump could pull this coalition together (3/x)
790270106517377025 2016-10-23 19:14:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> These 4 allies want different things from a Trump presidency, but all eyes are on the same prize for now (2/x)
790269310400729088 2016-10-23 19:11:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> The "burn it all down" alignment of interest among the alt-right, alt-left, Russia, and Julian Assange is fascinating (1/x)
790264720380956672 2016-10-23 18:52:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @smoothkobra no you are not. These alt-left guys just don't care about non-white men.

789965498637103104 2016-10-22 23:03:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RobertFrost01 I don't empathize w those ppl. It's self evident that Breitbart & Infowars = crap. Ppl want their own racist prefs validated
789962264224817152 2016-10-22 22:50:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RobertFrost01 ok forget about south then. Sanders was credible voice for redistribution & against moneyed interests. Trump=racist fascist

789954411984330752 2016-10-22 22:19:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> mm, assuming Trump himself doesn't run in 2020, he needs a horse. Pence could position himself as carrying Trump's water
789951922522337280 2016-10-22 22:09:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> Pence is well-positioned for 2020. Who else has cred w/Trump's base? Not Cruz Ryan Kasich. If Trump throws weight behind him cud be blowout.

789527496488169472 2016-10-21 18:03:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> Watching best news clips on Twitter (eg highlights from Al Smith dinner) is much better vs wading thru 30 mins on CNN. Trad TV news is dead

789509721656918017 2016-10-21 16:52:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro if that list is comprehensive and mutually exclusive, then presumably Tucker Carlson = a George Will wannabe?

789497904415158273 2016-10-21 16:05:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois too much football. And @pmarca (when he was active) had too many RTs. Actually that may be a Trump problem also.

789101602539917312 2016-10-20 13:50:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> Great articlehttps://twitter.com/AaronBlake/status/789100910765023232
789100636587425796 2016-10-20 13:47:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> CNN put stupid provocative Trump proxies on stage - saying things that made viewers dumber - because they spurred entertaining conflict
789100169027424256 2016-10-20 13:45:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Main indictment of CNN, but this strategy wasn't mistake; it was intentional by CNN. Trump surrogates bring drama/conflict, driving ratingshttps://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/788956802373259264
788988759740035072 2016-10-19 06:22:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> WSJ Deputy Editorial Page Editor -->>https://twitter.com/StephensWSJ/status/788925052670578688
788987639869296640 2016-10-19 06:18:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> The ratio of information on Twitter vs the debate itself is > 20:1
788986922081275904 2016-10-19 06:15:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rowast bombs = home runs in the 9th inning to the opposing team
788986025087414272 2016-10-19 06:11:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> Will Trump ppl switch their Twitter handles to "Nasty Woman"/a variant? Not sure how this works. Deplorable & Basement Dweller seems passe
788984579310784513 2016-10-19 06:05:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mikiebarb @billmaher Also none about education. Voters don't care about either.
788984002824798208 2016-10-19 06:03:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker @stogachess We'll see. "Republicans" is clearly not a monolith. Angry hater racists have more influence than we once thought.
788983715988779009 2016-10-19 06:02:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @liamstack @MikeIsaac Some are positioning themselves in Trump's will/estate plan. Some others want junior founding slots on NewTrumpTV.
788982338914922497 2016-10-19 05:57:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stogachess yep, I get it. But the passion she has inspired at this point is not necessarily the traditional/ideological Democratic base.
788981735874633728 2016-10-19 05:54:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> I mean, "nasty woman"? Maybe hippest thing that's happened to her during campaign.
788981437605089280 2016-10-19 05:53:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Quora @tristanwalker That's a fashionable (and exciting) idea. However, a splitting of the GOP prob results in 2 parties who can never win
788981143521538048 2016-10-19 05:52:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump has turned Hillary into an icon, and converted her supporters into a movement. A monster made her a hero.
788979782193061888 2016-10-19 05:46:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> Not sure if "stupid racists" is right language - suggest edits welcome. My answer to Has Trump killed the GOP? https://www.quora.com/Has-Donald-Trump-killed-the-Republican-Party/answer/Marc-Bodnick?srid=pg
788975273915977728 2016-10-19 05:28:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> I have a theory for why Trump doesn't care about misspellings in his tweets
788966001635274753 2016-10-19 04:52:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> OMG it's crazy how fast they get these uphttps://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/788964498401071104
788963148548087808 2016-10-19 04:40:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hillary is not super-eloquent, but she didn't have one inauthentic moment in the debates. A very grounded, modern performance
788962127180537856 2016-10-19 04:36:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> "I don't know Putin" - like a small-time criminal in a police interrogation
788931834570682373 2016-10-19 02:36:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> After 3 debates I have not been convinced that he will make America great again
788931417837154304 2016-10-19 02:34:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Damnhttps://twitter.com/jeffflake/status/788930879615737856
788929005864964096 2016-10-19 02:25:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Cernovich you are a bad guy
788928660812156932 2016-10-19 02:23:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> Executing a presidential campaign & presidential debate = big challenge. She's gone 3 for 3. Reasonable to think she'd be calm hand on wheel
788927625251041281 2016-10-19 02:19:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ok he's going crazy again
788926945257861120 2016-10-19 02:16:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> This guy says the same shit every time, to the same questions. You get the sense that he did no prep for any of these debates.
788925724346322944 2016-10-19 02:12:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> I've seen four or five tweets like this talking about totally different momentshttps://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/788925505734971393
788925345856524288 2016-10-19 02:10:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump's answer likely undermines @KellyannePolls & @mike_pence assertions that Trump will accept the election peacefully
788923871491567616 2016-10-19 02:04:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> Omg he just walked into the Trump Foundation swamp
788922993250492416 2016-10-19 02:01:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> Dammit Twitter why can't I load up other people with my feed? Everyone trying to grab my phone.
788921971237007360 2016-10-19 01:57:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> "Nobody has more respect for women than I do." I love this.
788920523031883777 2016-10-19 01:51:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> It looks like she anticipated the 30 years question
788917811951210497 2016-10-19 01:40:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @can why what do you think?
788916434260766720 2016-10-19 01:35:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> She's crushing him. I mean shit this is a master class.
788916217843068930 2016-10-19 01:34:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is a Rubio broken robot moment for Trumphttps://twitter.com/marcbodnick/status/788916021360898048
788916021360898048 2016-10-19 01:33:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> "I don't know Putin"
788915644527894528 2016-10-19 01:32:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hillary just called Trump a puppet
788914639870369792 2016-10-19 01:28:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> WTF is bigly? I thought that was a Twitter word
788914444378091520 2016-10-19 01:27:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Damn she looks crazy presidential. I just noticed because I had been mostly reading Twitter
788914158561484801 2016-10-19 01:26:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hillary wanted the wall? This is a new one.
788913991238037504 2016-10-19 01:25:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> Obama knows that if you bring in lots of heroin you still need to control the corners
788913221449023488 2016-10-19 01:22:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> Each of the 3 debates he's talked about being endorsed by ICE. I still don't understand this.
788912344436924416 2016-10-19 01:18:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanRather it's early; the other two debates got interesting after half an hour. Trump needs to put it in the air.
788910585689747456 2016-10-19 01:11:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Yeah this is the kind of normalization that would have been good for Trump before he revealed himselfhttps://twitter.com/kasie/status/788910244642435072
788910194738593792 2016-10-19 01:10:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Yeah this was newhttps://twitter.com/theplumlinegs/status/788909657674874880
788909573801259008 2016-10-19 01:07:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> Was there split screen 4 years ago? Much more fun.
788878573675302912 2016-10-19 23:04:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baratunde Misogyny and sexual assault are being exposed to public awareness and scrutiny
788875141790830592 2016-10-19 22:51:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JasonMillerinDC good for @peretti to put his reputation on the line and call out the bullshit coming from one of your primary surrogates
788874893244833793 2016-10-19 22:50:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JasonMillerinDC Your org is engaged in most systematic campaign of deception since WWII. Good ppl must do what they can to expose your lies
788871308016660481 2016-10-19 22:35:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'd like to see Jonah sort this out on The O'Reilly Factorhttps://twitter.com/peretti/status/788842667304038400

788818868525412352 2016-10-19 19:07:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> Insane - it's one thing to say "I will accept the outcome" but this is Animal Farm rhetorichttps://twitter.com/tpm/status/788817818712215556
788802082757234688 2016-10-19 18:00:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo yeah right; general obstructionism would have been the legacy pre-Trump
788800959002443776 2016-10-19 17:56:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is definitely true. What other possible legacy could McConnell have?https://twitter.com/isaacdovere/status/788800619851112448
788782921461010432 2016-10-19 16:44:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jason_howerton have you made similar declarations about Fox, Hannity, O'Reilly and Trump?
788781669457080320 2016-10-19 16:39:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HeerJeet @mtracey yes on delusional. She's also anti-vaccination. As for explanation - she wants attention and reasons to attack Hillary

788774957899591680 2016-10-19 16:12:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kfury yeah good point! Thank god for the debates - the only forum for high-profile accountability.
788773806315671552 2016-10-19 16:08:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Modern version of Big Lie. Trump will tell base anything, will lie about anything. Who cares if elites notice? Base believes Trump, period
788769330850697220 2016-10-19 15:50:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> I call this IQ price discrimination
788769198331748352 2016-10-19 15:50:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> Over and over: Trump says 1 thing & his surrogates say something else: transparent effort to get away with saying crazy stuff to dumb votershttps://twitter.com/timothynoah1/status/788767946768252928
788768169536081920 2016-10-19 15:46:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @acedriven yeah good point
788612185052311552 2016-10-18 05:26:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @triketora @hondanhon is this type of thing typical on Hacker News?
788602605970874368 2016-10-18 04:48:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> Not complicated - this is red meat birtherism for Trump's basehttps://twitter.com/liamstack/status/788601072629772288

788541971270742017 2016-10-18 00:47:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> The only bad thing about Trump losing is that Hannity won't leave for a White House jobhttps://twitter.com/nytmedia/status/788536420579348480
788528007262507008 2016-10-18 23:51:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RobertFrost01 for US politics > 1/2 of the best content is on blogs & Twitter (ie original tweets)

788427683793211392 2016-10-18 17:13:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> The lack of courage at the convention is why leadership should be held accountable (3/3)
788427485385924608 2016-10-18 17:12:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> However, there was one moment where party leaders could have taken decisive action - in Cleveland at the convention (2/x)
788427291890032640 2016-10-18 17:11:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> In general narrative that Republicans shouldn't have picked Trump is fallacious, bc GOP isn't monolithic & Trump voters were plurality (1/x)https://twitter.com/saletan/status/788401190975508481
788425081093443584 2016-10-18 17:02:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Many investors share these change-averse hangups, so these products often are successful raising money
788424853518856193 2016-10-18 17:01:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> There are some media products (e.g. The Skimm) built to take adv of temporary problem that people (usually older) don't like change/new UIs.

788394143248592897 2016-10-18 14:59:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Assuming a Hillary blowout, Cruz's original decision to distance himself from Trump at convention looks brilliant. Too bad he chickened out.
788391617686216704 2016-10-18 14:49:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu ayiyi this is crazy. Online media is massively better for reading v paper. Have any papers/magazines succeeded in trad format?

788257412834693120 2016-10-17 05:56:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bradsilverberg I don't think he could have beat her in primaries
788256533121372160 2016-10-17 05:52:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> Having a supporter who is occasionally critical comes off as much more credible
788249782288457728 2016-10-17 05:26:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump is in a shock escalation cycle now. The only way he can get more attention today is to act crazier than he was yesterday.
788249473902260224 2016-10-17 05:24:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm sure he's a good guy, but Paul Begala is not that effective as Clinton surrogate. His bias seems esp apparent. Axelrod is a lot better.
788248367855837188 2016-10-17 05:20:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mediajunkie @PatrickRuffini @EVNow I have no idea. But streaming services are pretty easy to use.

788240927970123776 2016-10-17 04:50:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mediajunkie @PatrickRuffini Not sure. I think Netflix is broadly popular.
788240799087505408 2016-10-17 04:50:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mediajunkie @PatrickRuffini eh, I dunno. Enough people use Netflix, iTunes, etc.
788239040491511808 2016-10-17 04:43:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MichaelBerrySho I bet it will be available asap post election. They will want to take advantage of heat
788238879568465920 2016-10-17 04:42:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PatrickRuffini @mediajunkie eh I wouldn't be so confident. Who knows.
788238545299177472 2016-10-17 04:41:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @karol @TheDailyEdge also he is a sexual predator
788234326584328192 2016-10-17 04:24:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> To be clear, Jeff Zucker knowingly puts morons on the air. This is CNN's systematic strategy - book stupid ppl & have smart ppl yell at them https://twitter.com/becketadams/status/788232905571074048
788225925783576576 2016-10-17 03:51:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> She is more authentic and grounded than President Obama - modern tone
788225742135963648 2016-10-17 03:50:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Just watched Michelle Obama speech. She could become best modern political orator since Ted Kennedy & Mario Cuomo.
788214899319070720 2016-10-17 03:07:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kyletblaine is this rationalization meant to co-exist with locker room talk or is it an alternative?

788156394625126401 2016-10-17 23:15:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jcukier no, I'm saying that history is may view the Hillary pres campaign as one of the best executed post-WWII
788143788107583488 2016-10-17 22:24:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NormOrnstein you are very funny
788142610313424896 2016-10-17 22:20:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jcukier yes I can see that POV. But I predict history will see it my way
788141112368041985 2016-10-17 22:14:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> The opposite of the 2000 Gore campaign -- play your cards shrewdly
788140212912164864 2016-10-17 22:10:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> For all of shit that Hillary's team has taken, this may be remembered as one of the most masterful campaigns in US history
788129843820896256 2016-10-17 21:29:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericries yeah although Trump is obviously a much bigger draw/franchise
788125846523392000 2016-10-17 21:13:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson Why holy shit?
788124847263977472 2016-10-17 21:09:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Thread https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/788095962887491584
788123941399179269 2016-10-17 21:06:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jyarow Billy Bush entrapped him
788123717389824000 2016-10-17 21:05:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry but yes
788123657600061440 2016-10-17 21:04:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry In the streaming world we don't talk about dayslots
788122676464189441 2016-10-17 21:01:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> And who knows - difficult to predict behavior of Trump passionate base. Will 2mm be willing to pay $100/year, out of the gate? Maybe. (4/4)
788122418749382656 2016-10-17 21:00:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> But there's 1 group who will find idea of NewTrumpTVCo very appealing - New York media investors. You can be sure this will get funded (3/x)
788122145700196353 2016-10-17 20:58:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> And yes, it will likely fail. Fox has so many advantages and the idea of a Trump-themed channel doesn't sound appealing, even to nuts (2/x)
788121782897172480 2016-10-17 20:57:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> TrumpTV is going to be a streaming service, not a cable channel - so stop focusing on how hard it is to establish a new cable channel (1/x)
788113283886698496 2016-10-17 20:23:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> Dems really need to lift head out of trees re case by case arguing with Trump about election being fixed etc (3/3)
788113105058271232 2016-10-17 20:23:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is a simple point that should be conveyable as public messaging from Dems (2/x)
788112948711399424 2016-10-17 20:22:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Idea that Donald Trump is a bad loser and hates idea of being considered a loser -> this is Occam's Razor explanation for his behavior (1/x)
788110167569072128 2016-10-17 20:11:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> In episode 6 Dolores is going to eat Bernard
788109947653410818 2016-10-17 20:10:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sri_gangsta it's very similar to west wing

788107728136699904 2016-10-17 20:01:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MakamaRH you're right but the signs are ominous
788107314616160256 2016-10-17 20:00:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry it's not working; no one cares
788106822339010560 2016-10-17 19:58:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> Westworld is starting to feel like a bad version of Lost, and Lost was boring
788106687819284480 2016-10-17 19:57:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @richardhenry agree; I'm going to retry this
788101183948726272 2016-10-17 19:35:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'd prefer to hear this from someone more crediblehttps://twitter.com/markknoller/status/788100720830578688
788100683916414976 2016-10-17 19:33:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @zamosta @mgsiegler if Rs keep Senate, feels like situation where H ultimately appoints a centrist judge; that's what McCain is playing for
788097649719193600 2016-10-17 19:21:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @zamosta @mgsiegler I don't understand why ppl are down on McCain for seeking leverage vs H SCOTUS picks; seems like a reasonable strategy
788097107991273472 2016-10-17 19:19:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thinkprogress @jedmund why is this cowardly?
788096855439585280 2016-10-17 19:18:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NewYorker @emilynussbaum @zthomas_nc I wasn't serious
788079841136381952 2016-10-17 18:10:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thefix @RyanLizza @TheFix people I talk to think it will be a streaming service not a cable channel
788076521327951872 2016-10-17 17:57:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo I hear you, but I think it's tactically and politically wise for McCain to say what he's going to do, early.
788075015321161728 2016-10-17 17:51:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Voters don't care about Merrick Garland being stranded, so McCain & other R Sens think they can take risk, which is probably right. (3/3)
788074772156383234 2016-10-17 17:50:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> If it's possible to use consent rights to force H to appoint more centrist justices, then McCain is doing his job for his supporters (2/x)
788074513091047424 2016-10-17 17:49:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm generally sympathetic to McCain's obstructionist position re: Hillary SCOTUS appointments (1/x)https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/788074078292893696
788071049434763264 2016-10-17 17:35:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> Really upsetting to think that @emilynussbaum might not have disclosed to New Yorker readers that she is a Hillary contributorhttps://twitter.com/mtracey/status/788070548421181440
788070451117297664 2016-10-17 17:33:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Boy this is erudite - "unmoored from underlying democratic traditions"https://twitter.com/TPM/status/788070077522386944
788068863527170048 2016-10-17 17:27:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey @mattyglesias It's really upsetting that leaders don't say exactly what they really think in every public and private communication
788068092676968448 2016-10-17 17:24:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> But now Trump apocalypse is clear, so finally Ds are standing up to media/Rs & challenging alarmist/high-drama coverage of email issue (5/5)
788067372212981760 2016-10-17 17:21:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Anti-HRC criticisms from left (Bernie supporters, prog bloggers) have given Ds doubts & kept them from calling bullshit aggressively (4/x)
788066874332368897 2016-10-17 17:19:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> ... and no certainly no worse than similar issues in the W & Reagan administrations (3/x)
788066665573388289 2016-10-17 17:18:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> This has caused Dems to not stand strong enough re Hillary's email "scandal," which is pretty vanilla as things go... (2/x)
788066278292336640 2016-10-17 17:16:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> Until recently, Dems have had huge self-loathing problem. They don't see their candidate as perfect. (1/x)
788065086250229761 2016-10-17 17:12:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianbeutler eh, I think McCain is trying to navigate being anti-Trump in super-red AZ. I wouldn't make much of this.
788060938981171200 2016-10-17 16:55:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows Yep. I ask because it's a pretty institutional-detail-y argument.
788060790918033410 2016-10-17 16:55:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> "Different sensibilities" is a nice way of saying that many primary voters embrace or don't care about racism and misogynyhttps://twitter.com/JohnJHarwood/status/788060445412323333
788060483433619456 2016-10-17 16:53:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @seanmdav It's absolutely comical to have this kind of discussion without talking about Hannity/Fox & Corey L/CNN.
788060173487136768 2016-10-17 16:52:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows is this writer (@yottapoint) credible? I thought this was really good but don't know his background.
788059555234091008 2016-10-17 16:50:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rowast @thefix there is no perspective or thoughtful context among breathless email media coverage. Compare to W for example.
788059251709063173 2016-10-17 16:49:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thefix @rowast the critique is fair. High-drama clickbait coverage re H email have led public to believe H is bigger liar than T - insane
788056082773966848 2016-10-17 16:36:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Jamie_Weinstein why do you think Jake Tapper cites a poll of polls rather than just CNN's poll?

786784758999035904 2016-10-13 04:24:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey @DarbyKathleen that's why we need Trump! Or at least enough cynicism and/or indifference that will result in Trump anyway
786783974353842176 2016-10-13 04:21:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm going to go on record now and predict that GM's Maven car-sharing service will be a huge failurehttps://twitter.com/VentureBeat/status/786778880241786882
786783305966374913 2016-10-13 04:18:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey @DarbyKathleen yeah the problem isn't trump, even if he wins. We brought Trump on ourselves and we should have to pay the price!
786782005082017792 2016-10-13 04:13:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @AndreaKuszewski 1/3-1/2? Maybe higher.

786780548395962368 2016-10-13 04:07:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey @DarbyKathleen yeah people are too worried about trump to see the big picture - she's terrifying even compared to him right
786780222041366528 2016-10-13 04:06:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey @rotkut oh man they are both the same; maybe he'd really manage to change things; at least it would be fun to watch!
786779461219864576 2016-10-13 04:03:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sarahcuda yeah I'm worried the Trump brothers are kinda backwards
786779256688775168 2016-10-13 04:02:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey yeah everyone thinks Trump is terrible and is worried what would happen to the country if he's elected
786776937783963649 2016-10-13 03:53:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @gabrielsherman Wait, Gabriel - I don't understand this tweet
786758408103792641 2016-10-13 02:39:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericries @tristanwalker @marlomajor I'm guessing you aren't a Trump base person
786735453596635136 2016-10-13 01:08:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker @ericries @Maidenberg did I mention that they will be New York internet investors?
786734467125694464 2016-10-13 01:04:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker @ericries @Maidenberg to be clear some New York investor will value it at $1B+ at launch - you heard it here first

786728890442010625 2016-10-13 00:42:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker mm I think both guys will be star talking heads on the new thing
786712938732146688 2016-10-13 23:39:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Gutless weasel words from @MarkHalperin. Clearly the Times did the right thing today by calling out Trump's hollow threat.https://twitter.com/sdkstl/status/786695337985449984

786650972948828160 2016-10-13 19:33:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @willwister absolutely. It'll be a steaming service. Think $100 per year w maybe 5mm subscribers
786645688608100352 2016-10-13 19:12:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> NewTrumpTVCo will have creation value of $1B at launch; founders allocation - each 1% is worth $10mm. This is what's motivating Rudy & Newt.https://twitter.com/abbydphillip/status/786644505281892353

786640831105019904 2016-10-13 18:52:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshuaforman my goal is a word that really irritates them
786640770954465280 2016-10-13 18:52:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshuaforman too heavy
786637458884538368 2016-10-13 18:39:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy yeah that's close. "Dupes" or apologists feels closer. I don't have the same feel for mean nicknames that I once had.
786635892106473473 2016-10-13 18:33:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesGellert something along the lines of putin dupes, but that's a mouthful
786635263413923840 2016-10-13 18:30:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> There should be a word like cuck to describe bloggers who are being taken in by Russian hackers/Wikileaks
786627178851028992 2016-10-13 17:58:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dlin71 you are extremely good at Twitter
786621634270552064 2016-10-13 17:36:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> ...very loudly distance yourself from misogynists - not just Trump but also Gingrich, Giuliani, & dozens of other misogynists GOP pols (5/x)
786621469300133888 2016-10-13 17:35:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's so bad/so obv bad, that if you are GOP leader & want to establish real credibility that you aren't a misogynist, you need to... (4/x)
786621095940022272 2016-10-13 17:34:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> Significant % of GOP voters are willing to look other way in face of sexual assault/harassment/misogyny & many GOP leaders follow suit (3/x)
786620890570031105 2016-10-13 17:33:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> But I now see that narrative is totally justified. (2/x)
786620561040379905 2016-10-13 17:32:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> I thought of myself as a Republican for a few yrs, but in doing so I had to discount narrative that "Rs have declared a war on women." (1/x)
786604428237299712 2016-10-13 16:28:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey frustrating that people see Trump sexual assault evidence more relevant than Bill Clinton stuff
786602698321698816 2016-10-13 16:21:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ezraklein @voxdotcom ask him about Trump
786602482096930817 2016-10-13 16:20:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sahilkapur 31% said it did?

786599718952443904 2016-10-13 16:09:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> Another error is harassing and assaulting dozens of women
786599255733444608 2016-10-13 16:07:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump threatening to sue and then not suing is a tactical error - now reporters can ask why he's not suing/following up on his threat.https://twitter.com/marcbodnick/status/786435551578599424
786596576592404480 2016-10-13 15:56:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro why would she skip?
786595077967663104 2016-10-13 15:50:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is *classic* CNN. Put a Trump imbecile on the air and then act shocked and appalled when he tells you about Area 51.https://twitter.com/leannenaramore/status/786580446926675968
786577566551244800 2016-10-13 14:41:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baseballcrank @NumbersMuncher @jonlovett your party should focus on 2016 vs 2012

786435551578599424 2016-10-12 05:17:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnolilly If the NYT dared him to sue it would make him look weak to his base if he did nothing. Someone should dare him to sue.
786435050527088640 2016-10-12 05:15:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnolilly Trump is in a bind. Apparently if he sues he opens himself to discovery. NYT should consider openly challenging him to sue
786433532440682496 2016-10-12 05:09:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro @moody It must be frustrating for CNN that Trump is so clearly the worse alternative
786422097098645504 2016-10-12 04:23:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Weak. If you are going to sue, you sue. You don't make a bunch of noise about how you might sue.https://twitter.com/DylanByers/status/786421623083573248
786412684904271872 2016-10-12 03:46:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @semil why do you think that is?
786410429069176832 2016-10-12 03:37:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> To state the obvious, this lawsuit will be bullshit legally; mostly aimed at creating plausible deniability air cover for Trump supportershttps://twitter.com/costareports/status/786382661476507648
786365444038889472 2016-10-12 00:38:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> How would Trump know? The man is 70 and has hundreds of skeletons in his closet. This Ohio GOP Chair is a self-delusional dopehttps://twitter.com/deirdrewalshcnn/status/786358899909783552
786364798405521408 2016-10-12 00:35:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> I mean, this is insane. Trump has completely opened the door to this type of thing, to the extent it needed opening

786331984444350464 2016-10-12 22:25:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Kellyanne Conway & Rudy Giuliani are concierges for evil - they should be held accountable even after this election is over
786330321545420800 2016-10-12 22:18:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> The "that's not what he meant" narrative is pure evil; this is how fascism is socialized
786329042135818241 2016-10-12 22:13:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is Trump campaign MO - IQ price discrimination. If you're open to bullshit, you're sold the literal; if not you're sold the figurative

786061338464358403 2016-10-11 04:30:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stewart @rsarver in most elections the loser is quasi-disgraced (Gore, Romney). But in this case I think his base will follow him anywhere
786061001808572416 2016-10-11 04:28:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stewart @rsarver I think he might run in 2020; nobody I talk to agrees but I don't see why he wouldn't. If the economy is bad he might win
786060018718302208 2016-10-11 04:24:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's out of fashion to say this but the only reason this type of thing works for Trump is that many of his supporters are jerkshttps://twitter.com/postpolitics/status/786059346480422912

785496722780807169 2016-10-10 15:06:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> Big question for Bannon is what percent of company Trump gives him. Probably on Giuliani's mind too. Hence rabid desire to please.
785496202775175168 2016-10-10 15:04:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SamWangPhD how do you think about possibility that some Trump voters are concealing their preferences from pollsters?

785485266882433024 2016-10-10 14:20:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @seanmdav Oh give me a break. In this case, the candidate himself is proposing it, and the chant is core to his following. Fascism.
785484892582780928 2016-10-10 14:19:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> For Steve Bannon, post-election business opportunity w/Trump is enormous. He'll be co-founder of New Trump TV.  That's what's driving Bannonhttps://twitter.com/costareports/status/785358648922910720
785375144478855168 2016-10-10 07:03:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ClaraJeffery he doesn't think that but his base buys narrative. Base likes big simple themes where political leader=ineffective/sinister
785363147641061376 2016-10-09 06:15:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ClaraJeffery I know this is out of fashion to say, but I don't have any empathy for Trump kids. They are part of Trump's fascist campaign.

785311714212315137 2016-10-09 02:51:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tedcruz @yankeejoe No chance because Trump is such a likely loswer
785309012296294400 2016-10-09 02:40:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> We're only in the middle of Act I of the Ghosts of Trump's past
785308587291660288 2016-10-09 02:38:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Well, one thing's for sure, the carpet bombing will start again within the next 48 hours
785308158231060481 2016-10-09 02:37:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @justGLew Or maybe choose between the 2 options we actually have
785302723436564481 2016-10-09 02:15:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CavenderG9 a lot of ppl agree w/u. But Im inclined to see logic 2 his actions. Hes systematically not pivoted in favor of base maintenance
785289102765633536 2016-10-09 01:21:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> Yay! Back to the birther fight. This is incredible.
785288985845248000 2016-10-09 01:20:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> One thing she's doing is not making this all about women - that's smart
785287753135042560 2016-10-09 01:16:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's great that Hillary is taking him on, straight-on - she needs to give voice to everyone's disgust. Gotta stand up to the bully.
785287310598213632 2016-10-09 01:14:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> "No time to think about sexual assault when ISIS is chopping people's heads off" - voters who buy this are either stupid or awful
785286142325166081 2016-10-09 01:09:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Aren't the moderators supposed to get the candidates to answer the question?
785285318165409792 2016-10-09 01:06:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Eh, whatever no handshake. Completely inauthentic for either to offer at this point.
785283386621382656 2016-10-09 00:58:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stuartpstevens goal is to throw red meat to base; maximize economic (new mediaco) and political power for 2017 & beyond
785282985394180097 2016-10-09 00:57:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JarrettHill nah she's there w husband
785276071537053696 2016-10-09 00:29:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> he's definitely given up; this is not a strategy to win over swing voters
785272366125375488 2016-10-09 00:14:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HeerJeet Real motive:strengthen connection 2 powerful/lucrative base - if 20% of voters follow him into hell->huge value to exploit in '17-

785268701377417216 2016-10-09 00:00:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump is playing endgame to feed red meat to base & solidify his leadership - passion of his base is the asset he'll take with him into 2017https://twitter.com/wlabovitz/status/785267852932775936

785192412180164608 2016-10-09 18:57:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> Uh, if I had to guess, I'd bet that (1) Trump is blackmailing Mark Burnett with something vs. (2) Burnett is actually a Trump supporterhttps://twitter.com/buzzfeedben/status/785180537484877824

785158534912577536 2016-10-09 16:42:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thang_doan nah I just saw that picture on Twitter
785158289830981632 2016-10-09 16:41:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is clearly the best way for Hillary to feed the beast (CNN, NBC) - give them great, outrageous scandal
785158048549527552 2016-10-09 16:40:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> This month is going to be Trump TV - people in politics tell me that a lot more stuff is coming
785153586078416896 2016-10-09 16:22:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> I mean this newspaper is a total waste of time - what is there in this issue that I did read on Twitter yesterday?

785139107529752576 2016-10-09 15:25:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Republicans should be furious with @Reince who forced Trump down the throats of GOP delegates at Cleveland convention
785137221095477248 2016-10-09 15:17:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> I should also note: great work done this election by others including  @kurteichenwald @MotherJones @TheAtlantic @jayrosen_nyu
785116594213040129 2016-10-09 13:55:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Newsweek @kurteichenwald @BigBlueWCrew yes I agree - Kurt has been awesome
785008498241249282 2016-10-08 06:46:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ClaraJeffery are you on west coast? I thought MJ was on East Coast
784982104954195968 2016-10-08 05:01:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshharkinson @markfollman @JoshHarkinson I agree that Mother Jones has been very good
784980218071113728 2016-10-08 04:54:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Fahrenthold @stevenjay did the Post remove the sign-up wall for your big story?
784978065893892096 2016-10-08 04:45:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> I agree @Fahrenthold is awesome but Post system-wide has been incredible. Huge % of best stories in my Twitter feed every day are from WP
784975821077254144 2016-10-08 04:36:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Oh & btw Trump shut off the Post's access and they basically said f--k you to Trump and then went and crushed it. Everyone else=suck-ups.
784973907446992897 2016-10-08 04:28:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> Thank god for the Washington Post. Who would we have relied on otherwise? The Times has been a disgrace and TV is integrity-free.https://twitter.com/amyfiscus/status/784967367201792000
784969513905250304 2016-10-08 04:11:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> Just like Katharine Graham and Ben Bradleehttps://twitter.com/amyfiscus/status/784967367201792000

784958283446521856 2016-10-08 03:26:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> I love the idea that this is being marketed as principle as opposed to he-can't-win-so-I'm-closing-my-checkbookhttps://twitter.com/patricksvitek/status/784957916012945409
784957838149902336 2016-10-08 03:25:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose aha! Whoops OK. I'm sensitive abt disagreeing w @JDVance1! His Trump-voters-need-our-empathy theme is difficult to argue with
784957160979439617 2016-10-08 03:22:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JDVance1 @sean_a_rose yeah I don't agree with that so clearly as you might; I know that is inconsistent with a Trump-base-empathy POV
784956703431282688 2016-10-08 03:20:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JDVance1 how can "how we nominate" be done better?
784956130795544576 2016-10-08 03:18:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @StanfordFball hey Stanford Football can you turn down speakers in front of press box? They are unusually loud.
784955808224116737 2016-10-08 03:17:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JDVance1 Like, who did wrong / made mistakes here? "Do better" implies incompetence or something like that.
784955383940907009 2016-10-08 03:15:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't see how this works. "Let's do better next time" - who are we talking about?https://twitter.com/jdvance1/status/784879212192595968
784946744119336961 2016-10-08 02:41:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose meaning why am I on that list? I don't know
784926046843867136 2016-10-08 01:18:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelrwolfe uh I don't think it's that easy; alienating Trump base is super dangerous for '18, '20. Read @TheRickWilson's post on this
784924513452433409 2016-10-08 01:12:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sarahcuda @chrisvnicholson that doesn't make sense to me. It's just basic research and digging
784922325128916992 2016-10-08 01:04:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @seanspicer @jbarro Sean it's hard to know what you think isn't true, b/c clearly dozens of GOP ldrs are denouncing Trump. What's not true?
784921875616890880 2016-10-08 01:02:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> If I were a GOP hedge fund fat cat, I'd be furious with Jeb Bush. He had $150mm and could have dug up all this stuff.
784916436594495489 2016-10-08 00:40:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is moment where GOP Sens/Govs/etc have max air cover to drop support. Now it's dangerous to stay w/Trump - opposite of prior 3-4 months
784912669421613056 2016-10-08 00:25:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> That's why everyone is dropping support now - PR networks effects -> every N+1th condemnation makes the moment feel more exceptional/extreme
784911977348935680 2016-10-08 00:22:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> Framing the disgrace of this moment=key to GOP hopes for placating angry Trump base - "we supported him too until super-bad thing happened"
784878132490670080 2016-10-08 22:08:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> Oh AP people give it a resthttps://twitter.com/llerer/status/784876640702726144
784852020192645120 2016-10-08 20:24:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @can not Quora - we boot those cancerous people
784851870598598656 2016-10-08 20:24:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @can IMO these were the four horsemen of the apocalypse re moral equivalence
784849542529191936 2016-10-08 20:14:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbarro he's playing it silently, trying to hit the narrow gap between Trumpkins and mainstream voters
784848958543638528 2016-10-08 20:12:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> Specifically: CNN, NYT, NBC, AP. American journalism is by and large morally bankrupt.
784848402936836096 2016-10-08 20:10:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Look, you guys have crushed it, but MSM was an abomination this cyclehttps://twitter.com/buzzfeedben/status/784847001808691200
784842723631042560 2016-10-08 19:47:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @everybodyshirts no, but there must be a ton of articles on this
784838337144115200 2016-10-08 19:30:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter is such a firestorm right now I'm seeing random people promoting their tweets; never seen that before

784819303807803392 2016-10-08 18:14:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SenJohnThune @jmartNYT @alexburnsNYT @JakeSherman I'm not a journalist but this seems like something that they teach you in J-school
784819065701306368 2016-10-08 18:13:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JakeSherman Did @alexburnsNYT & @jmartNYT follow-up by citing specific leaders (i.e. @SenJohnThune) who have called on him to drop out?
784818533255426049 2016-10-08 18:11:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trumpkins don't see this as a moment for nation to come togetherhttps://twitter.com/samsteinhp/status/784816866170638336
784813643263127552 2016-10-08 17:52:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> Other possibilities: Tom Cotton, Ben Sasse
784813173345878016 2016-10-08 17:50:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @aravosis that guy in the middle is shrewd
784812269162999809 2016-10-08 17:46:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Someone in the GOP will have a career moment by denouncing Trump in a dramatic way over next 24 hrs. Nikki Haley & Joni Ernst top my list.
784811723047833600 2016-10-08 17:44:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanDotLewis @jimmy_wales yeah of course but then his career would be over. He needs to straddle Trumpkins and trad conservatives
784810967070756864 2016-10-08 17:41:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanDotLewis @jimmy_wales it seems like a null set for Republicans as I understand
784810638048493568 2016-10-08 17:40:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> Yawn. @johnthune is now the standard - renounce Trump and call on him to withdraw or don't waste our timehttps://twitter.com/bencjacobs/status/784810221470232576
784810423233110016 2016-10-08 17:39:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jimmy_wales @DanDotLewis wait but in your first tweet you talk about Pence withdrawing now (?)
784809544601837568 2016-10-08 17:35:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanDotLewis @jimmy_wales how would this work?
784809440948031488 2016-10-08 17:35:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @zamosta @msquinn gotta let girls see Hillary stand strong - Michelle and I haven't changed our plans

784783278318362625 2016-10-08 15:51:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johannalichtman I hear you but it would be great if they could find smarter people

784765397794889728 2016-10-08 14:40:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is intellectually dishonest coming from a guy whose network was covering the weather instead of Trump's comments https://twitter.com/brithume/status/784742846192578562

784628780220506112 2016-10-07 05:37:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Fox News still covering the weather! They just make their viewers dumber

784615899760304133 2016-10-07 04:46:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> CNN's insistence on including Trumpkins on panels has resulted in some of the worst news coverage of our lifetime. The network is a joke.https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/784615081204150272
784613777354395648 2016-10-07 04:37:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NormOrnstein @RadioFreeTom yeah but Tom, Norm is right - NBC has been as atrocious as CNN, or worse. We shouldn't lose sight of that.
784610817912299522 2016-10-07 04:26:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hey journalists: when you tell us about Republicans now urging Trump to drop out, please let us know if they were Trump supporters beforehttps://twitter.com/jennaportnoy/status/784606926202101760

784602340389220352 2016-10-07 03:52:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @seanspicer why would we as readers think that @Yamiche is less credible than you? Ridiculous.
784595022108880896 2016-10-07 03:23:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HeerJeet I'm starting to wonder if Trump has psychological issues

784552828899565568 2016-10-07 00:35:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ESQPolitics @SykesCharlie No chance! Would damage PR hugely to keep appearance. At minimum, PR needs to signal disavowal of tape.

784452266212270080 2016-10-07 17:56:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm confused as to whether and when US progressives root for Putin - maybe Vox can write an explainer on thishttps://twitter.com/saadabedine/status/784451588089843712
784443425189867520 2016-10-07 17:21:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrislhayes it's possible that the Trump campaigning is overstating certain claims
784439219397664768 2016-10-07 17:04:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm now seeing that some white male progressives don't care about how a Trump presidency will impact women, African-Americans, Latinos, Jewshttps://twitter.com/marcbodnick/status/784429296978755584

784434995678941184 2016-10-07 16:47:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Heminator @seanmdav you tell your kids Trump is racist & misogynist - so they need coaching to understand how babysitter could support him
784431320441118720 2016-10-07 16:32:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Heminator @seanmdav for many of us Trump is an exception (catastrophically bad) but you guys don't agree I get it
784429296978755584 2016-10-07 16:24:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey I don't understand why it's gross if u agree w premise that Trump win would b catastrophic. At minimum Nation's POV is plausible

784135859373084672 2016-10-06 20:58:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> This article (linked to below) = best summary I've read re the state of the GOP. Extraordinarily well written & concise.https://twitter.com/johnjharwood/status/784129063975739392
784104809003495424 2016-10-06 18:55:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Jeff Zucker is the new Bond media villain a la Murdoch - if conflict doesn't exist, make it yourself
784103223036551168 2016-10-06 18:49:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> Look for CNN and NBC (and Fox) to go batsh-t with whatever anti-Hillary material they can find - anything to fuel prime time drama (2/2)
784102056558600192 2016-10-06 18:44:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> Now is a dangerous time with Hillary back in the lead. CNN & NBC are craving a close race - so much $$ at stake if it's a photo finish (1/x)

784050374118219777 2016-10-06 15:19:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> Idea it's a "fight" is ridiculous. @megynkelly is absolutely right & is acting like a journalist, while @seanhannity = straight Trump shillhttps://twitter.com/esqpolitics/status/784047475313238016

783892200367075328 2016-10-05 04:50:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mitchellvii your emphasis on online polls absence providing context about their limitations makes people less thoughtful
783891044211404801 2016-10-05 04:46:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mitchellvii Sorry, I deleted my tweet. What I meant to say is: your reliance on online polls degrades the judgment & knowledge of readers

783788222673321984 2016-10-05 21:57:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Our media is generally cowardly & conflict-avoidant - unwilling to label Trump an out-and-out racist & misogynist monster 2/2
783788034890145792 2016-10-05 21:56:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> Upon reflection: thank god for Tim Kaine who held Pence accountable last night. If Hillary and Kaine don't do it themselves, who will? 1/xhttps://twitter.com/prioritiesUSA/status/783787116660600832

783768183178014720 2016-10-05 20:37:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> Key article to help you understand whether Trump is racist / antisemitichttps://twitter.com/davewiner/status/783766871208255490
783756430490738688 2016-10-05 19:51:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> This makes no sense. It's astonishing how agitated people get about a peaceful protest in support of an obviously important cause.https://twitter.com/maxboot/status/783737372336754689
783746149026979841 2016-10-05 19:10:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> yeah I totally agree - their headlines are terrible; worse than CNN. Has this always been true?
783740673040146432 2016-10-05 18:48:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thefix 1 thing you may be missing - if Trump ends up sniping at Pence/not supporting him - Hillary will look loyal. No downside to loyalty.
783734776414863360 2016-10-05 18:25:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allahpundit @jpodhoretz @mattklewis I'm skeptical u can marry Trumpism w/o Trump - he'll want to exploit value created by his following
783732925644668928 2016-10-05 18:17:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz @mattklewis @allahpundit yep that couldn't be truer. So wide open. Trump himself runs again? Ivanka? Other TV personalities?
783732271001939968 2016-10-05 18:15:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allahpundit @mattklewis Trump's endorsement will matter a lot and there's no reason to think that he'd choose Pence
783725165679026176 2016-10-05 17:46:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump going light on tweeting vs. taking loud victory lap is consistent with media narrative that he's not happy with Pencepic.twitter.com/3cF42P971w

783671233904869376 2016-10-05 14:12:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias there's no chance that Republicans will be able to do the anointing thing with Rubio. It will be super-competitive.
783668037761335296 2016-10-05 13:59:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel @DouthatNYT The robot debate fiasco makes me think Rubio will not wear well as the frontrunner with the bullseye on him.
783664139034058753 2016-10-05 13:44:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HashtagGriswold @nickconfessore OK to use context. Sexist when Trump calls women fat pigs? Sexist when he judges them mostly on looks?

783480296188502016 2016-10-04 01:33:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ClaraJeffery why do you think that is?
783476204217077760 2016-10-04 01:17:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> None of this matters. Nobody is watching. This will all come down to 3 or 4 soundbites.
783435986327920641 2016-10-04 22:37:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alexburnsNYT I see. Yes the reporting part is fine. Saying that it's simply "making fun of someone's marriage" ignores misogynistic subtext
783433803322621952 2016-10-04 22:29:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alexburnsNYT @JohnJHarwood @JenniferJJacobs sharing this tweet is implicit endorsement of misogyny, esp since we all know what Trump means
783385713874079745 2016-10-04 19:18:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesGellert kidding aside re politics every reporter and pundit who matters with few exceptions is on Twitter
783384780679188480 2016-10-04 19:14:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesGellert it's Twitter contrarian at least; I don't see this theme anywhere

783027004064997376 2016-10-03 19:32:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> One hypothesis: there's a "let it all burn" alignment of interest among Trump supporters, progressive writers, and the Russian government
783022040542437376 2016-10-03 19:12:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't understand why progressive writers say that Russia interference in the US election isn't a big dealhttps://twitter.com/mtracey/status/783021424462135296

782973621123682304 2016-10-03 16:00:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RobertFrost01 yeah I don't agree. See my pinned tweetstorm on moral equivalence. I think Trump is an ELE monster
782972426992902145 2016-10-03 15:55:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RobertFrost01 & btw these 2 3rd party candidates r clowns. 1 doesn't support vaccinations & both r simply unqualified to lead our country.
782972103632883712 2016-10-03 15:54:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RobertFrost01 it happens to be accurate. If you oppose Trump but don't vote for Hillary, you are wasting your vote.

782654624385806336 2016-10-02 18:52:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker he's just one of the clowns
782652666119716865 2016-10-02 18:45:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> This guy is the personification of CNN's destructive politics-as-circus choreographyhttps://twitter.com/teddydaviscnn/status/782627439532969984
782636838624165888 2016-10-02 17:42:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonlovett obviously DJT is extreme but in part this is what happens to any campaign for 1st-time candidate who media has never prev vetted
782636246665302016 2016-10-02 17:39:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaketapper @alex @maggieNYT yeah, but CNN overall is atrocious. Jake Tapper is the veneer of journalism that wraps a destructive circus
782623406302765060 2016-10-02 16:48:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MattDickinson44 but there is a view that his core support is nowhere near enough to put him over top - thoughts on that?
782619735116566528 2016-10-02 16:34:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @StuPolitics that's true but counterbalanced by CNN decision to keep Corey Lewandowski/Jeffrey Lord creating stupid/distracting debates 24x7
782617378718822400 2016-10-02 16:24:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chucktodd @mtracey maybe for you - but Trump himself went out of his way to define/frame the issue last night as Hillary=unfaithful
782384875235971072 2016-10-01 01:01:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> Not surprisinghttps://twitter.com/mtracey/status/782384120542396416

782284202263781376 2016-10-01 18:21:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @OkazuYuri @iansimon this tweet is comical given the comparative tactics of the two sides
782282595451015168 2016-10-01 18:14:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KevinWGlass I posted this today, which is relevant to your tweethttps://twitter.com/marcbodnick/status/782268116994695168
782277414218891265 2016-10-01 17:54:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu pretty likely he'll be back
782277150690861056 2016-10-01 17:53:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey @cinnlafey OK I just read it. I don't see how this is worse than Trump's financial/self-interested conflicts
782274863268438016 2016-10-01 17:43:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey @cinnlafey I can't possibly imagine a thoughtful rationale for how Huma is worse
782270335810809856 2016-10-01 17:25:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> And you are an accomplice to potentially the greatest and most evil con in history 10/10
782270177203236865 2016-10-01 17:25:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> So if U R a both are terrible person you R indirectly but powerfully encouraging narrative/belief system that inc chances DJT will win 9/x
782269824571277312 2016-10-01 17:23:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is what the Trump campaign wants and how he may win - by demoralizing potential Hillary supporters into inaction 8/x
782269668241182720 2016-10-01 17:23:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Both are terrible rhetoric = very dangerous b/c it encourages people to stay home or vote for bozos @GovGaryJohnson & @DrJillStein 7/x
782269300308447232 2016-10-01 17:21:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> Clinton Foundation & email stuff: nowhere near as bad as Trump past/future corruption but NYT/CNN/progressives unwilling to acknowledge 6/x
782268959185735680 2016-10-01 17:20:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> Im a HRC supporter from the right and I empathize w/those who oppose her but I absolutely dont understand idea that she's as bad as DJT 5/x
782268645611147264 2016-10-01 17:19:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> So when you say both are terrible, you imply that Hillary is also this bad, which is clearly ridiculous 4/x
782268447346393089 2016-10-01 17:18:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> Thoughtful people agree: Trump=most despicable pres candidate ever - clear danger to republic, demagogue who inflames racism & misogyny 3/x
782268257893883905 2016-10-01 17:17:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> The theme (which you see over and over on Twitter) that both candidates are terrible is self-indulgent and morally bankrupt 2/x
782268116994695168 2016-10-01 17:17:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> On moral equivalence: 1/x
782268051563552768 2016-10-01 17:16:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> Im posting 2 tweetstorms today about the election:  1. On Trump/Hillary moral equivalence 2. On @davidplouffe's its in the bag narrative
782254260054470657 2016-10-01 16:22:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nikhilbd I see it somewhat when I criticize a pro-Trump journalist
782254044152672256 2016-10-01 16:21:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nikhilbd interesting. Well, you know me, I'd still take the hit for the long term gain
782252996151226370 2016-10-01 16:17:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> The bad people clearly discourage VITs, women, high-profile ppl from participating 4/4
782252170263408640 2016-10-01 16:13:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nikhilbd what do you mean? You think this group might count for > 2% of traffic?
782251825613254657 2016-10-01 16:12:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> Start with the low hanging fruit - not controversial 4/4
782251649297371136 2016-10-01 16:11:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> There are only benefits to Twitter and the community - these people add nothing 3/x
782251464571756544 2016-10-01 16:10:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> Adopt a policy and enforce it - not hard 2/x
782251380547342336 2016-10-01 16:10:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't understand why Twitter can't move more aggressively to ban racists, nazis, misogynists 1/x
782250321787490304 2016-10-01 16:06:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Olivianuzzi @mikiebarb @everycallyoumak as contemptuous as fat-shaming women and encouraging nazis and racists? Get some perspective
782223254958149632 2016-10-01 14:18:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is misleading - ignores pt abt moral equivalence / creating impression of moral =. "They are both terrible" is cry of progressives.https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/782208788967424000
782219183157227521 2016-10-01 14:02:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MrDanZak That's the problem - not the existence of conflicts
782219154984022016 2016-10-01 14:02:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MrDanZak My point: "conflicts" is too neutral a headline. Isn't there every reason to think that he will act in his self interest?
782218742193238016 2016-10-01 14:00:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MrDanZak I have a hypothesis for how he will handle those conflicts. Not difficult when you have consistent principles of decision making
782217427572502528 2016-10-01 13:55:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> I feel subtweetedhttps://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/782208788967424000
782216233072472065 2016-10-01 13:50:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaketapper why is this the headline instead of noting the conclusion? Your neuter headline implies there is no meaningful news
782214639564099584 2016-10-01 13:44:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @politicalwire @Redistrict your tweet implies equivalence - as if we would have a problem if either was elected.
782214475856216064 2016-10-01 13:43:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Redistrict @politicalwire this is really overstated. Happened in 1992 and we were fine. That's not the problem here - the problem is Trump
782211998238904320 2016-10-01 13:34:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> Great question - @NYTnickc @patrickhealynyt?https://twitter.com/ericboehlert/status/782202586732650496
782093683487158276 2016-09-30 05:43:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @kausmickey he really needs to do a better job concealing his hate and misogyny
782091667566239744 2016-09-30 05:35:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thefix i.e. many people resent having a black person or woman as president and the Chris Matthews stuff lets them backsolve to that
782091179177357313 2016-09-30 05:34:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thefix he's right=oversimplification. That's rationalization used by many to justify feelings&prefs that aren't actually based on all that

782053052828176384 2016-09-30 03:02:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> sure. My point is that The Intercept is obsessed w H's major 2-3 "scandals" but not so much Trump's 25-50 corruption issues
782051925860556800 2016-09-30 02:58:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> Greenwald is part of the moral equivalence problem
782046938703147008 2016-09-30 02:38:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> watergate looked like silly narrative until Woodward Bernstein did work. Lots of circumst evidence that Trump-Russia is real
782044241149124609 2016-09-30 02:27:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @the_intercept this isn't even a top-50 trump corruption & evil story. Sorry if Russia ties don't interest you
782043641380425728 2016-09-30 02:25:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey this is almost as bad as Trump multiple staffers having close financial ties to the Russian government
782042674953986048 2016-09-30 02:21:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NickRiccardi if u share story w inaccurate headline & tweet saying "this is bad for [subject]" - thats an endorsement of article & headline
782040923140001793 2016-09-30 02:14:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NickRiccardi you should know better and be on guard given that the AP wrote one of the most atrocious stories of this election
782040546608947200 2016-09-30 02:12:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @politico @NickRiccardi by sharing it you attach your credibility to the headline, and the headline is inaccurate
782040036426387456 2016-09-30 02:10:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NickRiccardi @politico nick maybe you should read these articles before sharing them
782039038274306048 2016-09-30 02:06:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HeerJeet if Trump loses I think GOP leaders will drop him like it's hot; won't support contesting results

781527581078061056 2016-09-29 16:14:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias @NateSilver538 please don't take this off Twitter
781523482303533056 2016-09-29 15:58:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> There are so many good factual stories to tell about Trump's past. These are way more interesting than more rehash of issue positions.
781523155386937344 2016-09-29 15:56:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> From here on debates could really play to Hillary's adv. Fewer ppl will watch live, but H can plant seeds/set media agenda for 7 days after
781522378870235136 2016-09-29 15:53:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> Remarkable that Hillary had to lead media to focus on Trump/sexism stories. Debates create confrontational drama - how media needs to be fedhttps://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/781469140280225792

780817661038997504 2016-09-27 17:13:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Tim Kaine is going to light up Mike Pence
780817167616847872 2016-09-27 17:11:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rsg @sasmith4 he has Ailes who is insane. But I think he resents having to restrain himself in face of attacks. Hard to coach thru that
780798701157527552 2016-09-27 15:58:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hillary showed good discipline in not saying things are good/fine
780796730941898752 2016-09-27 15:50:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheStalwart @NoahCRothman another possible interpretation is that she appeared like a worthy leader last night and he did not
780780243455840260 2016-09-27 14:44:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> The guy who has to be relieved after last night is Lester Holt. Solid work, not taking blows from either side
780772854396653569 2016-09-27 14:15:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nickconfessore he's in a bind this time bc his temperament is what's in focus; saying provocative stuff exacerbates rather than distracts
780652657211953152 2016-09-26 06:17:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @janestreet @NBCNews your neutral headline is disgraceful and Lauder-esque
780652330932801536 2016-09-26 06:16:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Cowardly corpo NBC hides conclusion with this gutless, neuter headline - that 18 Trump lies account for 20 items on listhttps://twitter.com/janestreet/status/780649726760869888
780649862802976768 2016-09-26 06:06:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> He can't run from his words so she can drop the hammer and amp up aggressiveness. Feels very authentic & fair to attack him this way
780649172227596288 2016-09-26 06:04:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hillary & team now has time to consider how to use tonight's material to unleash attacks in Debate II.
780645909407293440 2016-09-26 05:51:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is what I'm getting athttps://twitter.com/katherinemiller/status/780645108379185153
780644354524270592 2016-09-26 05:44:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Bigger story tonight may be HRC laying landmines that she'll detonate at Debate II. Birtherism, taxes, climate change, misogyny - not done
780639130992521216 2016-09-26 05:24:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> In the VP debate, Kaine is going to hammer Pence with Trump's language / words. Who cares what Pence has to say.
780635358237106176 2016-09-26 05:09:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> All the interrupting and rudeness - totally crazy.
780635038173900801 2016-09-26 05:07:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm surprised more people aren't making the Rick Lazio debate comparison. These sexist guys just can't help themselves.

780622467228327936 2016-09-26 04:17:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> This debate was the only way Trump could be forced - in front of 100mm people - to address birtherism, sexism, hiding his taxes, etc
780533987097751552 2016-09-26 22:26:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> Easy to forget there are 3 debates not 1. HRC can play 2nite safely, plant seeds on # of issues that can be reworked in media/later debates

779443455407775744 2016-09-23 22:12:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> What's incredible about this article is that no one is pushing Trump to spend more of his own moneyhttps://twitter.com/politicoalex/status/779442781655826432

779145134667468800 2016-09-22 02:27:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @anildash Meaning Peter Thiel is on the board of Facebook? I don't see how that part is at all relevant.

778463634863206405 2016-09-20 05:19:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @everybodyshirts IMO voters have generally accepted that Trump is outrageous. Better to get him on the big lies on major stuff.
778459831971688449 2016-09-20 05:04:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @everybodyshirts I don't think these language scandals stick at all. Most people likely think they are small-time pc bs

778458444382601217 2016-09-20 04:58:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is tactical victory for Trump - "language scandal." Noise re this BS non-issue scandal completely distracts from stuff that matters. 2/
778457974285086720 2016-09-20 04:56:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> CNN now burning prime-time hr debating whether Trump is right that things are worse than they've "ever ever" been for Afriican-Americans. 1/

778347995230330880 2016-09-20 21:39:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> Charity story might be interesting to people if it could get some GD oxygen from MSM
778347886157455364 2016-09-20 21:39:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericries Good question. Bear in mind that email story has been covered for months in tremendous depth. Didn't start off interesting.
778346881927802881 2016-09-20 21:35:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> There's no evidence that DJT Sr cares or has scolded DJT Jr, right? Gotta be intentional. No chance Sr lets Jr keep doing same stupid stuff.

778343941171187712 2016-09-20 21:23:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Fahrenthold @Run_IsHere ++ agree. CNN is esp atrocious. Super-low-quality dramabait w/brand wrapper "CNN" making everything look high-end.
778343376458485760 2016-09-20 21:21:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> They're ignoring it bc (1) they don't want to highlight Post's work; (2) story is detailed & boring; (3) CNN prefers stupid-simple drama 2/2
778342642354679808 2016-09-20 21:18:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> CNN & NYTimes are so weak on giving attention to @Fahrenthold's charity investigation 1/https://twitter.com/Run_IsHere/status/778338355087970304

778335923264163840 2016-09-20 20:51:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> Since he can't win, I'll focus on what I don't like about Hillary, or how great it would be if a third-party protest candidate did well, etc
778335745975193600 2016-09-20 20:51:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> One thing I've learned talking to ppl: perception that Trump can't win has encouraged lazy non-outcome-oriented/sociotropic voting criteria
778316760248451072 2016-09-20 19:35:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisamccoy Gimme a break - compared to the depths of corruption, conflict, and lies in Trump's business web?

778315103473139712 2016-09-20 19:29:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr Right! The system is broken. Let it all burn down. Nobody can fix it; everyone is corrupt.
778310290844872704 2016-09-20 19:10:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> If voters become disgusted with both candidates + the system, that's depresses turnout; good for Trump.
778310149991694339 2016-09-20 19:09:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr Useful phrase & I may have different slant. IMO, GOP intentionally fosters system-wide disenchantment so that voters stay home
778287600637349888 2016-09-20 17:39:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GlennKesslerWP @PostRoz Curious what your intent is re posting this. It's effect is to create impression of moral equivalence.
778264906801950720 2016-09-20 16:09:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump's pattern w/strong women is to make nice on-stage & then disparage later to friends on TV/Twitter. He might blow a gasket @ Mon debate
778110020672184320 2016-09-19 05:54:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hunterwalk @rfradin @joshelman This is crappy thought, but if you're current CEO, you practically have fiduciary obligation to stay neutral
778100145430880257 2016-09-19 05:15:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac remarkable how little feel Warner Brothers/DC seems to have for these movies
778098163274158086 2016-09-19 05:07:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MikeIsaac I didn't see it but was meaning to; sounds like no redeeming qualities
778081433730494464 2016-09-19 04:00:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> Target audience here isn't black voters; it's undecided voters who are worried that Trump is a racist. This is all Ailes.https://twitter.com/JesseLehrich/status/778045491351347200
778051160980623360 2016-09-19 02:00:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is toxic but its simple logic resonates widely & its logic is at core of mainstream anti-immigration feelingshttps://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/778016283342307328

778007247783735296 2016-09-19 23:05:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu @tomfgoodwin Think about what I'm describing as a direct, online, real-time spin room -- but using Trump's own words only
778007148466876417 2016-09-19 23:05:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu @tomfgoodwin I'm thinking about a very simple URL which she could refer to in-debate. Media would obviously see it immediately
778001764788252672 2016-09-19 22:44:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu @tomfgoodwin I assume you can't buy ads during debates (?) Anyway, on-demand clips would be pretty useful
778000607500115968 2016-09-19 22:39:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jayrosen_nyu Jay what about option for HRC that she sets up online vids that she can refer viewers to during debate? eg early DT Iraq clip
777998363622936576 2016-09-19 22:30:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @GovGaryJohnson @I_am_ryan_S to be clear, super-Nader mean 5+% of vote; there's a big canyon btwn spoiler & a winning coalition
777960440219308033 2016-09-19 19:59:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @aravosis well at this point I only really hold NYT/WP accountable; all the TV folks are coin-operated & have no incentive to be strong
777960151110201344 2016-09-19 19:58:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> So there's an alignment of interest between the goals of (1) campaign character oppo research and (2) the media (especially TV media) 6/6
777958024543555584 2016-09-19 19:50:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> Media also is part of the problem; they want "balance" for $ reasons and personal attacks/character problems are easy and cheap to cover /5
777957650780737537 2016-09-19 19:48:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> This works well bc: -there's usually enough material to work w/in nominee's past -many voters dislike elite Dems & want biases confirmed  4/
777957023728017408 2016-09-19 19:46:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Goal of Swift Boating is to create moral equivalence so that certain undecideds can discount importance of comparative integrity 3/

777953954810335233 2016-09-19 19:34:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DylanByers @fmanjoo there's a strong case for Christie. To align w/Trump & end up w/nothing - brutal. Jeb has his integrity
777952805063565312 2016-09-19 19:29:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> On Quip, can you create a list section where top-level items are numbered, but sub-points are bulleted?

777947164144115713 2016-09-19 19:07:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DylanByers @fmanjoo Jeb Bush is definitely in the hunt; Christie was never a front-runner

777945954146250752 2016-09-19 19:02:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @I_am_ryan_S What I'm reading 2day is GJ is taking some millenials/undecideds from HRC. So yeah that could affect close race - "super-Nader"
777917086475563008 2016-09-19 17:07:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump rhetoric is so over-the-top it's possible electorate can accept a worldview that is generally too nuanced&unemotional for politics 5/5
777915700509716480 2016-09-19 17:02:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> But it's what she authentically believes, and it plays to her strength and credibility as a diplomat /4
777915497278939136 2016-09-19 17:01:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's a subtle, complex arg that doesn't resonate as well as "we need change" and "we need to knock the hell out of ISIS" /3
777915261760319488 2016-09-19 17:00:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> She would have to explain value of prudence, moderation, caution; this arg won't appeal to Trump core base, but might work on undecideds 2/
777914827482144768 2016-09-19 16:58:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> The question "Who does ISIS really want - Trump or Hillary?" seems like a potentially strong line of attack for Hillary 1/
777912162958266368 2016-09-19 16:48:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jasonlk killer point. You are crushing it lately.
777899294636412930 2016-09-19 15:56:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker My theory: only the NYT & WP have strength and integrity to take on Trump. See tweetstorm I've pinned on my profile.
777898933322260480 2016-09-19 15:55:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker What's Jeff Zucker's incentive to do that? He's crushing it financially at CNN as a result of this election.
777898757727801347 2016-09-19 15:54:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker sure as 1-time thing. Then T would freeze out that network. Did you see Lauer forum? Got sky high ratings throwing softballs
777898280227221504 2016-09-19 15:52:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker Trump will only give access to interviewers who play nice. He's done barely any non-Fox interviews at all since conventions.
777898068490412032 2016-09-19 15:52:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker TV interviewing is done as a tool for truth-finding, at least this cycle. There's no room for Ted Koppels & Mike Wallaces
777897741166874628 2016-09-19 15:50:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tristanwalker I think you have to ask what motivates interviewers and their employers. It's not good journalism.

777711516736905217 2016-09-18 03:30:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SopanDeb actually this doesn't seem like a crazy argument, as much as I hate to admit it
777698200282996736 2016-09-18 02:37:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NathanWurtzel IMO it's 10x ratio, not 2x, a la this https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/775809939537178624. Trump = worst liar nominee ever; much worse than Nixon
777696533038837760 2016-09-18 02:31:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NathanWurtzel We'll agree to disagree. This is basically where I am http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/opinion/sunday/clintons-fibs-vs-trumps-huge-lies.html?_r=0. IMO equivalency args are wrong and destructive
777695643741528064 2016-09-18 02:27:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NathanWurtzel "lie is as fantastic & egregious as anything" is type of H equivalency arg Trump ppl r using to neutralize sociopath problem
777695206397181953 2016-09-18 02:26:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NathanWurtzel I don't mean to be difficult, but I think we should all be on guard for false moral equivalence assertions.
777691776597446656 2016-09-18 02:12:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @StuPolitics @NathanWurtzel like saying you were against the Iraq war when you weren't?
777643055994146817 2016-09-18 22:58:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NormOrnstein allows entertaining conflict & argument w semblance of newsworthy balance. Also costs zero. Most viewers don't know better.

777599760924454912 2016-09-18 20:06:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> no, thanks - this is awesome
777558675883831296 2016-09-18 17:23:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> ...and whether they held him accountable for his Big and little daily lies - taxes, charity, Iraq, etc etc /14
777558435084709888 2016-09-18 17:22:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> History will judge whether NYT did its job accurately characterizing Trump as lying manipulative racist demagogue /13
777556112698552320 2016-09-18 17:13:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> The New York Times sets agenda for much of the national media, & as an institution its supposed to care about truth & stand up to power /12
777555629577674752 2016-09-18 17:11:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> We need Times to do real investigative work, which will give everyone else courage to do right thing. Only the NYT & the WP can do this /11
777555243114430464 2016-09-18 17:09:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> This brings me to my conclusion - our Republic needs @nytimes to do its job better /10
777554701994778624 2016-09-18 17:07:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> 2 big howevers: 1. Most TV reporters want to do right thing 2. It's imp to TV news nets to *look* reputable/focused on good journalism /9
777553208558260224 2016-09-18 17:01:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> CNN is especially useless as journalism outlet - basically same as Fox. But ABC/NBC etc are similarly coin operated /8
777553016010383360 2016-09-18 17:00:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> TV nets have no integrity or journalistic character at core - at least not any more /7
777551934416793601 2016-09-18 16:56:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> But TV is different; Trump access is presumably a commercial bonanza that is difficult to forego /6
777551490604937216 2016-09-18 16:54:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> This makes me admire the Washington Post which has continued its tough (best in industry) reporting on T despite him blacklisting them /5
777551091122573313 2016-09-18 16:53:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> The problem is not that @GStephanopoulos & @megynkelly need lessons on how to interview, but rather they are in a commercial bind /4
777550832065585152 2016-09-18 16:52:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> What's going on of course is that *access* to Trump is scarce  & valuable for ratings. Trump knows this and uses it to his advantage /3
777550534790090752 2016-09-18 16:51:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> Video in @jayrosen_nyu post shows various reporters questioning Trump on taxes in weak way - incl @GStephanopoulos, who is typically good /2
777549482485358592 2016-09-18 16:46:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> This post makes you wonder: Why don't reporters who interview Trump push him harder- ala Mike Wallace/Ted Koppel? /1https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/777203276202803201

777216209884327936 2016-09-17 18:42:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> I think they could create drama from those issues if they made a concerted effort
777196642176860161 2016-09-17 17:24:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> You don't get talking head drama from in-depth investigation a la @Fahrenthold /14
777196541605928960 2016-09-17 17:24:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Key point - networks just want to show people arguing loudly. Language scandals are perfect for that. /13
777195559408984064 2016-09-17 17:20:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> You have to watch CNN for a few hrs during 1 of these lang scandals to really understand this marriage of superficiality & faux scandal /11
777190264112689152 2016-09-17 16:59:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> And it's not in the media's interest to persuade viewers to care about issues that are very expensive to cover/investigate! /10
777190119006580736 2016-09-17 16:58:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> The media is all about audience, and there is no obvious demand for coverage of charities, taxes, Big Lies, etc. /9
777189421250519040 2016-09-17 16:56:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Through this lens, I think the Khan comments that Trump made were a miscalculation, because normally that kind of thing works for Trump /8
777189345472028672 2016-09-17 16:55:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> T supporters+undecideds don't care about language scandals, so this approach is costless. If anything they make him seem ++ authentic /7
777188756025593856 2016-09-17 16:53:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump language scandals suck up full days of coverage and give corpo media (I'm looking at you CNN) air cover to say "we are balanced!" /6
777188302440968192 2016-09-17 16:51:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> This negative coverage+"need for balance" gives media excuse not to spend time,focus,investigating resources covering issues that matter /5
777187792489111552 2016-09-17 16:49:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> These are easy "scandals" for the press to cover; so reporters cover/analyze these statements endlessly for a day. /4
777187599978901504 2016-09-17 16:48:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> Example: "let's have Hillary's bodyguards get rid of their guns and see what happens." Or his other 2A comments. /3
777187459666817024 2016-09-17 16:48:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump understands media wants/needs to show balance, so he makes crazy controversial statements to mop up "negative coverage" capacity. /2

777173846038241281 2016-09-17 15:54:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thefix @NormOrnstein you should publish your notes in @TheFix's email exchange as standalone tweetstorm /1
777166113880756224 2016-09-17 15:23:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> Must-read: @NormOrnstein's superb analysis of media coverage of the electionhttps://twitter.com/thefix/status/776864040031223808
777159759472369668 2016-09-17 14:58:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @counternotions "why promote a lie may be unanswerable" - this is like the riddle of the sphinx to the times
777029755971305473 2016-09-16 06:21:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brad_wolff @TheAtlantic & @NYMag have both been very good. @johnastoehr also.
777020998495313920 2016-09-16 05:46:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> If CNN was really trying to create show where viewers learn, they would've booted this guy a long time ago
777020331357634560 2016-09-16 05:44:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Corey is the poster boy for media trying to create conflict & fake balance. Don Lemon & panelists keep yelling "Corey, that's not true!"
777018896494698496 2016-09-16 05:38:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> Watching CNN is painful (mostly bc Corey Lewandowksi is so awful) but it helps you understand the Ali-Frazier thing CNN is trying to create

777015313749512192 2016-09-16 05:24:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pmarca @semil @davepell I heard a rumor this week that we're in a risk bubble
777014153546391552 2016-09-16 05:19:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> : - Everyday lies: 10-20 lies per day; 70% of T statements=lies - Tax disclosure - Charities (@Fahrenthold issue)

777009286429814785 2016-09-16 05:00:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Stupid for media & H campaign to focus on language miniscandals - ie Trump's bodyguards comment today. Nobody careshttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/777008191704006657
776992932922621953 2016-09-16 03:55:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NYTnickc why call these emails apocalyptic? Are they unreasonably alarmist? Are they more apocalyptic vs other GOP/Dem fundraising emails?

776938010134712321 2016-09-16 00:17:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HeerJeet yep, this is central insight
776935250718928896 2016-09-16 00:06:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo all the more impressive with his importance
776934631991980032 2016-09-16 00:03:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> Nate Silver has re-emerged as the #1 political analyst on Twitter. He's been crushing it for the past couple weeks.https://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/776554293826560000
776932116286148608 2016-09-16 23:53:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bfpeters trying to reach you about a domain - follow me?

776922481168830465 2016-09-16 23:15:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @peterdaou who are the editorial decision makers at NYT,  NBC, CNN, CBS, ABC?
776887965737902081 2016-09-16 20:58:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin whatever he is doing is working - the Post has superb high integrity
776886943619489792 2016-09-16 20:54:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Needs to be said - the Washington Post is destroying the New York Times in covering this election
776884472864047104 2016-09-16 20:44:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NYTnickc @JustinHousman super interesting. where are you guys on investigative work re trump charities and taxes?
776874165382950913 2016-09-16 20:03:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NathanWurtzel I don't think the joke is great even w correct spelling
776871972160450560 2016-09-16 19:54:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NathanWurtzel I see. Was misspelling Aleppo intentional?
776871285913559040 2016-09-16 19:52:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NathanWurtzel that joke makes no sense
776871072981356545 2016-09-16 19:51:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT @kathleenparker yeah Kathleen why "final." Odd choice. Sounds like you want issue put to rest.
776866015988752384 2016-09-16 19:31:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ComfortablySmug it's not effective in the US
776849435540107265 2016-09-16 18:25:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thefix if u don't agree T has effectively manip'd press to avoid dealing w tough Qs, then u r in a v dif place vs media critics like me /3
776848482627833856 2016-09-16 18:21:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thefix It's disgraceful how long they took to focus on the birtherism, and there are a zillion other issues like it /2
776848237084807168 2016-09-16 18:20:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thefix @GoingPublicOrg Chris The broader issue is that the press hasn't covered Trump critically enough and gets played over & over /1
776845769915588608 2016-09-16 18:10:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericries thanks! Twitter is giving me a chance to atone for dropping out of grad school
776841954378199040 2016-09-16 17:55:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @samhouston not sure. I think Trump really struggles with not responding to an issue that the whole media cares about.
776841706196959232 2016-09-16 17:54:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> Concentrated media attn is what's needed on tax returns & lying abt charity. Not enough for 1-2 reporters ala @Fahrenthold pounding table /2
776841090854903809 2016-09-16 17:52:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> Lesson from this cycle: when press decides something is important, they can force Trump to confront an issue. /1
776839072698372097 2016-09-16 17:44:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @swin24 Interesting. I assume this is a sly wink-wink dogwhistle to birther idiots
776838345095688192 2016-09-16 17:41:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo to anyone who hasn't read NS post, your headline seems to imply that Trump is currently projected as leading in the EC vote, period
776837387917721600 2016-09-16 17:37:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo this is his conclusion - a conditional assertion that doesn't support "T has electoral college adv not C"pic.twitter.com/tlWEnTDjmM
776833196742746112 2016-09-16 17:20:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo eh this isn't what Nate Silver's post says
776828089766596609 2016-09-16 17:00:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @thefix @jonfavs I feel like this is a dodge/gracious offramp. @TheFix - do you think today was positive for Trump politically?
776824838593781760 2016-09-16 16:47:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @brianstelter @bydanielvictor so late - disgraceful
776820723000090624 2016-09-16 16:31:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is good. H needs to b more aggressive rolling out surrogates who'll say mustwatch/harsh talk re each day's newshttps://twitter.com/tpm/status/776818691421900800
776816985925521408 2016-09-16 16:16:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> Maybe best tweet I've seen so far on birtherism news today. Concrete investigable assertions of fact to follow up onhttps://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/776815412939853825
776812097900392448 2016-09-16 15:56:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> sure, but I'm saying generally - for me they'd be on list (so would NBC) w Jake Tapper being an exception, like Kristof for NYT
776811614410379265 2016-09-16 15:54:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> you don't include CNN on the list?
776810665365299200 2016-09-16 15:51:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonlovett even for you that's an epic tweet
776798113155518464 2016-09-16 15:01:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> I suspect Trump's late bc he & Ailes r debating what he'll say. Odd press conf 2 have in midst of Ailes pivot archttps://twitter.com/rebeccagberg/status/776795814983237632
776678147370520577 2016-09-16 07:04:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattocko I dunno I think that would really play into his system is rigged narrative (plus it's wrong)
776675631320801280 2016-09-15 06:54:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattocko I understand criticism from ppl like @davidplouffe @jonfavs. They are focused on execution; ie hey Dems stop moaning & get it done
776671310843752448 2016-09-15 06:37:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @adamnash ayiyi the trad press loves this narrative
776670030092120065 2016-09-15 06:32:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> Nah. Trump knew from radio show research that birtherism played big w/dopes; by emphasizing it he built base for future run
776669334747750402 2016-09-15 06:29:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @soniasaraiya - Obsessed with balance - Unwilling to call out T as terrible & hugely abnormal - per @NickKristof http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/opinion/when-a-crackpot-runs-for-president.html /3
776668854445453313 2016-09-15 06:27:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @soniasaraiya - Not asking T hard questions - Not following up with hard questions - Very focused on access and ratings ... /2
776668506884411392 2016-09-15 06:26:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @soniasaraiya I dunno... Seems like media is behaving awfully similarly. NYT AP CNN NBC/Lauer/Fallon - lots of examples of consistency: /1

776665601519472642 2016-09-15 06:14:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisamccoy @mattocko @pt some WWC men, and some college white men
776662899091578880 2016-09-15 06:03:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisamccoy @mattocko awesome - I'd been looking for the Plouffe podcast but couldn't find it on Google. Thanks @pt!
776662361994174465 2016-09-15 06:01:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NateSilver538 @hunterw me too. It encapsulates what many feel: media desire for balance results in not digging in2 nearly any of DT's Mitts
776661116298625024 2016-09-15 05:56:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hunterw Did you see @NateSilver538's tweetstorm about Hillary being 5 Mitts and Trump being 50 Mitts?
776649300214362112 2016-09-15 05:09:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytpolitics @arappeport Why is key question "will he say it now"? Why not: why did he engage in a long & cynical campaign during 11-14?
776648341719363585 2016-09-15 05:06:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows Yup. @NickKristof's op-ed today was terrific, for example. But that almost feels like an effort to whitewash everything else.
776647499582799872 2016-09-15 05:02:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows Look, I agree. But in general the complete enterprise-wide failure of the Times during this election is clear and shocking.
776647044681216003 2016-09-15 05:00:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows It's pathetic that we've reached a point where the NYT needs to be praised for writing an accurate headline
776643942137810944 2016-09-15 04:48:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @aravosis sorry, I misunderstood your tweet. You're right.
776643526255779841 2016-09-15 04:47:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @aravosis It's beneath him, obviously
776633878253494272 2016-09-15 04:08:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> HRC voters have no option if mad -> CNN NYT AP etc will never lose HRC voters. But Trumpers have Fox - that threat looms over media /3
776633307853230086 2016-09-15 04:06:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> I suspect another big factor is: media is v afraid of alienating Trump supporters (~40% of voters) who drive $1B in profits at Fox News /2
776633042857172993 2016-09-15 04:05:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> Re how biased the media has been, the easy argument is that reporters & their employers like conflict & a close horse race. But.... /1
776620788732403713 2016-09-15 03:16:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> The moral sell-out & ethical bankruptcy of CNN is underemphasized story. Incredible that Corey is still on payroll.https://twitter.com/mattmfm/status/776591505293185026
776619074663043073 2016-09-15 03:09:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy the media is completely myopic around the birtherism - unwilling to call a monster a monster
776618277753659392 2016-09-15 03:06:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> How does he media not get this? The obsession about pinning down what he thinks now is insane /3
776618108676997120 2016-09-15 03:06:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> Real issue: he dragged country through a distracting cynical self-serving deceitful campaign that inflamed racism /2
776617952921554944 2016-09-15 03:05:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> OMG who cares what Trump says now about birtherism /1https://twitter.com/alivitali/status/776613119451865093
776581543984627712 2016-09-15 00:40:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaredkrouss yeah maybe I'm missing something but I would assume that NFL VITs get drowned in this distro format
776579998756941824 2016-09-15 00:34:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaredkrouss well, I think any choice other than "show all hashtagged tweets" is complex, but yeah - this doesn't work as a viewer/reader
776579454361440256 2016-09-15 00:32:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter NFL timeline too noisy - all I want to see is sportswriters and people I followpic.twitter.com/pDxDp0Xu9V
776572966515544064 2016-09-15 00:06:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @block_sandra another top-5 issue for me is the birther thing; my instinct: insisting that he be pinned down there is useful to exposing him
776571277012152320 2016-09-15 23:59:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rsg why is it nuts
776570905895899136 2016-09-15 23:58:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @therealbradg Sausage Party is one of the five funniest movies ever
776553406554972160 2016-09-15 22:48:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> I agree. Context: Donald Jr. is a moronhttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/776552687034851328
776552562644299776 2016-09-15 22:45:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Setting expectations for setting expectations - @NateSilver538 has been crushing it this weekhttps://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/776552007092109313
776547364160929792 2016-09-15 22:24:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @block_sandra so what would you pick as the top issue?
776545885257805824 2016-09-15 22:19:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is more important than Donald Jr. saying gas chambershttps://twitter.com/thedailybanter/status/776484319313485824
776544107619426304 2016-09-15 22:11:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> good question - I think taxes & financial conflicts, but I'm not sure
776543611596836864 2016-09-15 22:09:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @yuvalariav yes, exactly
776531524405432320 2016-09-15 21:21:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BillKristol The media can help voters understand this better - the idea that Trump is on their side is belied by facts
776524553082122240 2016-09-15 20:54:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NickRiccardi @politicalwire what do you mean? What's realignment argument?
776523317423452160 2016-09-15 20:49:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @trekonomics yep. But given that nearly nothing is sticking, it would be better to pick fights that help, bc time & attention are scarce
776522974996205568 2016-09-15 20:47:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @trekonomics and speaking for myself I'm more worried about Trump as a father of daughters than as a Jewish person
776522705029861376 2016-09-15 20:46:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @trekonomics yeah I know. But again I just don't think undecideds are buying and/or care that Trump is antisemitic
776521848280403968 2016-09-15 20:43:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> There is a full menu of Trump issues to focus on; given voter indifference, subtle dogwhistling & dumb gaffes should prob not make top 10 /3
776521188591882240 2016-09-15 20:40:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> Voters seem to not care, and, if anything, many think that hammering about this type of thing is "politically correct" obsessing /2
776520900208308224 2016-09-15 20:39:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> This view may not be popular, but I'm not sure it makes sense for anti-Trump ppl to dwell on this kind of mistake /1https://twitter.com/jamilsmith/status/776520293149990912
776517956385726467 2016-09-15 20:28:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @HotlineJosh @sullivanamy Pictures of Trump w African Americans (regardless of content) makes him more normal looking. Pure Ailes. /2
776517861082750976 2016-09-15 20:27:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sullivanamy @HotlineJosh it's indirect outreach - to college educated whites. /1
776482474486407168 2016-09-15 18:07:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rsg T would b most corrupt president ever; even v Nixon. There is incred material 4 inv journalists to work w but GG only cares re HRC. 2/2
776481901955551232 2016-09-15 18:04:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rsg I feel strongly that that's really a rationalization. He can make choices about how he spends time. 1/2
776481310026010624 2016-09-15 18:02:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> And it's completely dishonest/disingenuous for him to claim role of principled "adversarial journalist." He has an agenda, full stop. /6
776481069130362881 2016-09-15 18:01:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> But he & other media/bloggers are not disinterested observers; they r key principals - really influencing outcome & helping bad guy win /5
776480527616315392 2016-09-15 17:59:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> And, let's be honest, given how close Trump is to winning (no worse than 2:1?), some of Greenwald's depressing cynicism is justified /4
776479118489636865 2016-09-15 17:53:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Greenwald & Wikileaks likely *want* Trump to win bc that'll show that US=cynical broken system, morally equivalent to every other system /3
776478263745011713 2016-09-15 17:50:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> He wants to show the world that the US isn't better than any other country and that American exceptionalism is bullshit /2
776478119611932672 2016-09-15 17:49:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is just a public rationalization by Greenwald to justify his nihilistic pro-Trump/anti-HRC bias. My view is: /1https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/776465659941257216
776476328052744192 2016-09-15 17:42:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenjySarlin "he's tough" vs. "he's abrasive"
776476130404478976 2016-09-15 17:41:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenjySarlin Dick Neustadt said: a prez's personal qualities are treated as strengths when the economy is good and weaknesses when it's bad
776457620890587136 2016-09-15 16:28:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Moments maybe intends to solve that problem but I don't think it does /6
776456957947371521 2016-09-15 16:25:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> I imagine that for most users this is a problem - they don't know who to follow in pretty much any topic. /5
776456818952241152 2016-09-15 16:25:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> For me Moments are the only way I find great content about music, because I don't know who to follow in music. /4
776456577536581632 2016-09-15 16:24:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> I want to see what I like in Moments in Timeline, not on a side stage. /3
776456265106984960 2016-09-15 16:22:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> Page 2 interaction doesn't work. I only check Timeline and only want to check Timeline. /2
776456042154631168 2016-09-15 16:22:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> Moments are great but I never check them /1pic.twitter.com/itNng9nNv8
776447986637254657 2016-09-15 15:50:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EsotericCD @NateSilver538 EV?
776286635281395712 2016-09-14 05:08:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> Uber poached all those Carnegie Mellon robot folks like, what, 15 months ago? Pretty awesome. /3
776286162360999936 2016-09-14 05:06:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> Seeing Uber self-driving cars in Pittsburgh is a reminder that Google clearly isn't going with the minimum viable product approach /2
776285971805380609 2016-09-14 05:06:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's counterintuitive because GOOG is supposed to be the tech co, but Uber's dev velocity re self-driving cars seems insanely productive. /1
776210989410754560 2016-09-14 00:08:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> right. At this point any proposed changes by a candidate looks weak.
776208325918625792 2016-09-14 23:57:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hypothesis: Trump is right re scrapping debate mods. Unclear what value they add. We want mano-a-mano w/no mediationhttps://twitter.com/DylanByers/status/776207545908297729
776207416799010816 2016-09-14 23:54:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> As much as I've been a critic of @NateSilver538, it occurs to me that he was early in calling the Trump rebound
776206375080767488 2016-09-14 23:49:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy OK maybe that's enough urgency. I doubt it.
776206225792901120 2016-09-14 23:49:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> good headlinehttps://twitter.com/ddale8/status/776206053239353346
776199909540106240 2016-09-14 23:24:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> Well-run companies have hard enough time dealing w/this risk; fed gov is clowntown comparatively. Treating this like crisis is key. 3/3
776199667583295488 2016-09-14 23:23:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> Social engineering hacks (e.g., fake emails asking for passwords) are probably a bigger problem than straight security holes 2/3
776199577409957888 2016-09-14 23:22:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Obama should prioritize addressing Fed Govt phishing & hacking problem asap. I don't see this happening thus far. 1/3
776197306139889664 2016-09-14 23:13:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @allahpundit what's the rationale for this theory? What would be their motive? Access?
776195110308417536 2016-09-14 23:05:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'd guess Obama is at least considering pardoning Snowden b/c administration hasn't quelled speculation (yet) https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-President-Obama-will-pardon-Edward-Snowden/answer/Marc-Bodnick
776192265026842624 2016-09-14 22:53:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> 9/26 debate is going to be epic -- good v. evil. Most dramatic scheduled event in US politics going back a long time.
776185665641783296 2016-09-14 22:27:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jbouie I don't think this is such a mystery. He makes for great ratings, and they covet access.
776142920944459777 2016-09-14 19:37:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @zamosta awesome
776131745397608448 2016-09-14 18:53:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Plus, duh: - Pivoting to center is what Trump clearly *should* do - Ailes=arguably most effective political comms operative of our lifetime
776120113732857857 2016-09-14 18:07:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ailes is the only discontinuity that explains recent break between emotional Trump and prudent Trumphttps://twitter.com/granthenryhall/status/776112385807491072

776097705797885953 2016-09-14 16:38:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jkatzman Is Ben not on Twitter?
776064681198833664 2016-09-14 14:26:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Ford @nealboudette There are strong reasons to be skeptical that Ford will be a winner in self-driving vehicles. Are you optimistic?
775929722802806785 2016-09-13 05:30:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BuzzFeedAndrew seems likely that Trump will put Rice, Powell in his crosshairs, hammering them for Iraq. Probably why they've been so quiet
775927260603752448 2016-09-13 05:20:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davepell yeah, at first glance, anyone concerned about this stuff is likely already voting against him. @kurteichenwald: thoughts?
775914130066644992 2016-09-13 04:28:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pbump This may not be fair, but my immediate reaction is that the big headline ("In the Company of Trump") is pretty tame
775913466502770688 2016-09-13 04:26:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> Great @QuoraSession w/Minerva Schools founder & CEO Ben Nelson  https://www.quora.com/session/Ben-Nelson/1pic.twitter.com/a8p4pLI3If

775901675198439424 2016-09-13 03:39:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @joyalex2001 @stuartpstevens FYI I'm a Hillary supporter
775893025532674048 2016-09-13 03:04:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stuartpstevens It's all Ailes programming thru Nov. Seems smart; nobody cares about hypocrisy. T needs to pivot to ctr & work w/what he can
775889214583955456 2016-09-13 02:49:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> word. This is key factor (fierce competition for social distro) that people r missing in analyzing media behavior this cycle
775886991841910784 2016-09-13 02:40:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> There is zero interest in investigating stories in depth with strong follow-up. Hit and run, hit and run.
775886730905870336 2016-09-13 02:39:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Corpo MSM outlets can't resist impulses to (1) be "balanced" & (2) keep horserace tight by tearing down the candidate with momentum. 2/2
775886228365332482 2016-09-13 02:37:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Insane how anti-Trump my timeline is now -- filled with hard-hitting corpo MSM stories -- after 2 straight weeks of anti-HRC stories. 1/2
775873345065660416 2016-09-13 01:46:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> eh, we'll see. I'm guessing this story is still coming.
775840576419672064 2016-09-13 23:36:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> We should all be grateful that the Murdochs didn't fire Roger Ailes 3 months ago
775839924914302978 2016-09-13 23:33:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sknthla after this cycle I have a hard time believing that any of MSMcos will make it. They are not tuned to scale in new world.
775835496496848898 2016-09-13 23:16:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> wowhttps://twitter.com/dylanbyers/status/775797169823453184
775825233022373888 2016-09-13 22:35:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @baker I've heard a rumor that you disagree with one or more of my tweets
775824628170182656 2016-09-13 22:33:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @speechboy71 While I agree with that, it does seem like Trump would be our heaviest president in some time, no?
775823466104627200 2016-09-13 22:28:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang I hear u. She's gotta play cards she's got. Nobody else can. Good news: he doesn't do well when confronted by strong women
775821036243726336 2016-09-13 22:18:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Fahrenthold needs to adopt more issues than just the charity stuff - there are too many other important prioritieshttps://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/775811825589858304
775820408599695360 2016-09-13 22:16:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> Stop worrying about intermediation and moderation and just attack. /3
775820297010163712 2016-09-13 22:15:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hillary will need to own taking on Trump head-on in debates, which feels where the world is heading anyway. /2
775820059511881728 2016-09-13 22:14:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> Debates seem especially important this year, given general cowardly aversion of MSM to challenge Trump /1
775818338828025858 2016-09-13 22:08:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NormOrnstein yeah this thread by @DouthatNYT is an elaborate rationalization for media optimizing to foster conflict/tight race

775766262513139713 2016-09-13 18:41:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ErikWemple @elisefoley Ppl like me think corpo outlets r doing poor job & shud b held accountable in RT w/aim of getting them to change /3
775763058417278976 2016-09-13 18:28:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ErikWemple @elisefoley (i.e., on the ultimate votes of handful of ppl who are undecided); and/or (2) media is generally doing a good job /2
775762793186205696 2016-09-13 18:27:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ErikWemple @elisefoley I don't understand this POV, unless you think: (1) media coverage doesn't have huge impact on outcomes /1
775762489552216064 2016-09-13 18:26:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr nuanced headlines don't generate clicks
775736946828070912 2016-09-13 16:44:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tomfgoodwin ok try now
775736465145724930 2016-09-13 16:42:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> IOW it's difficult for these brands to stay true to themselves, authentic, genuinely maintain brand - in era of social distribution /7
775736125285552128 2016-09-13 16:41:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> But straight news is a commodity! And boring. And difficult to get social distro for. /6
775735981177606144 2016-09-13 16:40:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> Their brands are supposed to be neutral + great journalism + we're-telling-you-what-the-objectively-important-news is today. /5
775735611072196608 2016-09-13 16:39:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> By contrast, traditional prestigious outlets (AP, CNN, etc.) have a very difficult set of tensions to manage /4
775735198914752513 2016-09-13 16:37:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Also, they don't have the burden of a big prestigious editorial brand to defend a la AP, CNN, NYT, ABC, NBC, etc. /3
775734924514988032 2016-09-13 16:36:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> They've always depended on social distribution, and always had to deal with the pressure to bait clicks. /2
775734674110820352 2016-09-13 16:35:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Not surprising that Buzzfeed, Vox have confident voices & clear editorial strategies. They were born in the current distro environment. /1

775570314344357888 2016-09-12 05:42:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> You don't understand how these companies work if you think CFO Ruth Porat is gatekeeper for new inv $$ on moonshotshttps://twitter.com/trnsprtst/status/775452522827747328
775569084297523200 2016-09-12 05:37:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @LeahRBoss @CheriJacobus I think she's just saying that he's very overweight
775552253839015936 2016-09-12 04:30:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @meganesque what do you mean - legalized in 2013?
775548148903096321 2016-09-12 04:14:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Also I suspect we're underestimating importance of clickbait headlines in '16: desperate chase for engagement. Dumbo corp MSMs = worst perps
775546383566680068 2016-09-12 04:07:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> Desperate big-$$ motives incent destructive behavior. These outlets are not neutral at all -- they are conflict/Trump-addicted
775546095409651712 2016-09-12 04:06:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Big commercial "neutral" platforms (AP, CNN, NYT, ABC, NBC) have provided terrible reporting & bias this cycle
775545209270603776 2016-09-12 04:02:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hypothesis: left/right polar outlets (RedState, WS, NRO on R; MotherJones, HuffPo on L) have become more trustworthy than corpo MSM

775448174877999104 2016-09-12 21:37:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sknthla yeah this is one medium-sized reason why (good) VC exists. Very difficult for inexp ppl to sort signal/noise in startups
775441277177311232 2016-09-12 21:09:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @docrocktex26 damn this is a beatdown

775390190139379712 2016-09-12 17:46:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Which is that MSM corpo media is biased against HRC. As @tanehisicoates, etc have pointed out, coverage of deplorables was terrible. (2/3)
775389845308870656 2016-09-12 17:45:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> I've been thinking about @davidaxelrod's tweet this AM, and I think he's missing the bigger problem (1/3)https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/775308081794199552
775386955991224320 2016-09-12 17:33:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> It is Orwellian/Swift Boat-crazy that Hillary will be pressured to release medical records ahead of Trump releasing tax records.
775385385178271745 2016-09-12 17:27:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @WesleyLowery he's crushing it w/Atlantic posts. Ppl who agree w/this should dig in & push friends in media to ans hard ?s

774644514816274432 2016-09-10 16:23:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi yeah might justify initial speculation, but not holding onto POV today. At this point it's just a rationalization
774643865823301633 2016-09-10 16:21:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nytpolitics @EricBoehlert @patrickhealynyt Patrick - what's the thinking on this?
774642628654616578 2016-09-10 16:16:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi David we don't agree but I appreciate your civility
774642357912285184 2016-09-10 16:15:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CapehartJ @davidharsanyi so what's an alternative theory for why Trump believes that Obama was born overseas? C'mon, Occam's Razor
774642021675864064 2016-09-10 16:13:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CapehartJ @glossontech @davidharsanyi is there a similar theory that ~1/2 of a party subscribes to http://www.politico.com/story/2011/02/51-of-gop-voters-obama-foreign-049554
774641279275720704 2016-09-10 16:10:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CapehartJ @davidharsanyi my hypothesis is that the birther conspiracy resonates because he's black & birthers don't want a black president
774640753314181121 2016-09-10 16:08:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Strongly disagree with this - being a birther is racist AND stupidhttps://twitter.com/davidharsanyi/status/774640029683617792
774640262765088768 2016-09-10 16:06:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CapehartJ @davidharsanyi totally disagree; racist AND stupid
774639885156093952 2016-09-10 16:05:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CapehartJ @davidharsanyi That's more revolting than HRC call racists racists (2/2)
774639784069169153 2016-09-10 16:04:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CapehartJ @davidharsanyi polls are consistent on what half of pro-Trumpers believe - & man himself is still birther. (1/2)
774638817357672448 2016-09-10 16:01:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CapehartJ @davidharsanyi 22 million of his supporters being birthers, etc. doesn't seem crazy
774638447105495041 2016-09-10 15:59:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidharsanyi @CapehartJ wrong 22 million
774508387694284800 2016-09-10 07:22:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tvaziri that movie had a lot of special effects

774491479351767040 2016-09-09 06:15:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @speechboy71 @patrickhealynyt @JamesFallows yeah aversion to saying "lie" results in terrible journalism that sanitizes & enables Big Lie(s)
774490721281683456 2016-09-09 06:12:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows @speechboy71 @patrickhealynyt if you don't like that example there are many others. Flip=flatout incorrect as characterization
774490455664791552 2016-09-09 06:11:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows @speechboy71 @patrickhealynyt I don't mean to be difficult, but why not use word lie? He was for war & says he wasn't. (1/2)
774490084481437698 2016-09-09 06:10:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter is now batshit full of angry race debates - TV networks likely to follow. This is good for Hillary.
774489671044771840 2016-09-09 06:08:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> Deplorables discussion puts GOP leaders like Ryan & McCain in bad position. May force them to further distance themselves from Trump.
774487598488104960 2016-09-09 06:00:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Bencjacobs headline is wrong
774487414530158592 2016-09-09 05:59:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows @speechboy71 @patrickhealynyt flip flop is less imp than lie. Is this confusing or wrong in your view? Times is blind on this.
774486739133931521 2016-09-09 05:56:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Example below - anything that reminds college whites about ugly nature of Trump's base is favorable ground for HRChttps://twitter.com/eclecticbrotha/status/774479567251726336
774483195681046528 2016-09-09 05:42:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @speechboy71 @patrickhealynyt @JamesFallows yeah Patrick why do you use the word "flip"?
774482946564591616 2016-09-09 05:41:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows @patrickhealynyt fwiw I don't understand this reply
774481860021727232 2016-09-09 05:37:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> And assessing whether 1/4 or 1/2 of his supporters are racists seems ultimately good for Hillary re appealing to college white voters (3/3)
774481437659541504 2016-09-09 05:35:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Racism is not a safe/productive topic for Trump; he wants it to go away (2/3)
774481268348116992 2016-09-09 05:34:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hillary *might* have made the deplorable point on purpose - as bait to get Trump talking about race (1/3)
774469401730920448 2016-09-09 04:47:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @redsteeze I see. You just like making irrelevant points (FDR was a Dem) to attack Hillary & to create impression of racist moral =alence
774468109365235712 2016-09-09 04:42:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @redsteeze Yeah HRC idolizing FDR is prob bc he implemented internment camps. Of course your man idolizes murderous dictator. So theres that
774467081437786114 2016-09-09 04:38:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @redsteeze I'm curious if you believe that over half of Trump's supporters believe that Obama was born overseas, and if so, why that is.
774466949703094277 2016-09-09 04:38:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @redsteeze My question about Obama's birth is a lot more relevant to this election than the fact that FDR was a Democrat.
774466168128012288 2016-09-09 04:34:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @redsteeze I'm curious if you believe that Obama was born in the United States.
774465825755455488 2016-09-09 04:33:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @redsteeze What's the point of this tweet?
774464101481259008 2016-09-09 04:26:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo @redsteeze do you have links on those? Would be great to have a list.
774463959424339968 2016-09-09 04:26:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ComfortablySmug I don't see the moral equivalence between Bernie supporters and birthers.
774463442174357504 2016-09-09 04:24:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans how do you come across it? I never see it.

774023382899843072 2016-09-08 23:15:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's amazing that it took this long for Trump's Iraq War lies to catch up to him. Might be good for Hillary to catch this wave now.

773984973472706560 2016-09-08 20:42:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jyarow this point is key. Like living in world where we seek to explain why every1s gone insane w/o noting that Joker poisoned water supply
773981607153676288 2016-09-08 20:29:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Misogyny is pervasive - nearly impossible to see because it's everywhere. This is not 2008 - people are resistant to novelty and change.
773980561694011392 2016-09-08 20:25:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is an intensely reactionary moment - after 8 yrs of a black president, there's a thirst for a return to the old normal
773976961244803072 2016-09-08 20:11:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> As hard as it is to believe, many people are just now focusing on the differences between the 2 candidates

773967697428160512 2016-09-08 19:34:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @StevenEJohnston It's simpler than "truth is complex" - industry simply isn't a house of cards
773965440355741696 2016-09-08 19:25:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Examples: last night's NBC forum, Rob Lowe roast. Twitter gives me event FOMO - not fun to hear about party after the fact (2/2)
773964927232974849 2016-09-08 19:23:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter makes me 2nd-guess whether media fragmentation is overrated as trend. Super-fun to watch same thing @ same time as every1 else (1/2)
773962722316726272 2016-09-08 19:14:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> Theranos obv = exceptional case. But I guess it's more fun to go all Tom Wolfe/Great Gatsby, bc readers want to believe House of Cards stuff
773959794562506754 2016-09-08 19:02:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't get why serious people in SV tolerate this kind of easy, irrational, "whole industry is a scam" crap in wake of Theranos, etc. Lazy.
773958275033206784 2016-09-08 18:56:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Arg't only works if investors r all getting tricked. That's obv ridiculous, so it's easier to stick w/snark vs make real pyramid scheme case
773954522825621504 2016-09-08 18:41:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CGasparino this is absolutely not primary complaint about Lauer, which is that he interviewed Trump like morning news lightweight.
773952007409238016 2016-09-08 18:31:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ReaganBattalion and he pointed to Putin's 82% approval rating.
773925495033344000 2016-09-08 16:46:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> Do you use night mode on Twitter?

773745724865425408 2016-09-07 04:52:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonlovett @pkcapitol most voters only focus on election in last 2 months. Press has huge responsibility between now and November
773745152070344704 2016-09-07 04:49:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonlovett @pkcapitol wrong. he's unpopular bc he's a lying racist manipulator - whipping up frenzy of hatred & dividing country in ugly way
773743975530242048 2016-09-07 04:45:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> not journalistspic.twitter.com/kOWZCK5p1I
773741804667535360 2016-09-07 04:36:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @_danilo Definitely. He can't avoid the debates - he'd look cowardly to his base. Being afraid of a woman=highest crime for Trump supporters
773740374808367104 2016-09-07 04:30:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Silver lining of @MLauer NBC clusterf--k: moderators for real debates now know - they'll be held accountablehttps://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/773713695369228289
773736817174556673 2016-09-07 04:16:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> that wasn't "super-adept." The questions were a joke.
773730716169281537 2016-09-07 03:52:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm at peace w/Twitter & other social media becoming new platforms of record - replacing traditional, broken conflict/$-fueled models. (2/2)
773730129386188800 2016-09-07 03:50:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @seanhannity @stogachess great - you stick with @MLauer then. I think he's an abomination.
773729468108070912 2016-09-07 03:47:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @seanhannity @stogachess lol. we clearly didn't watch the same thing tonight.
773729120408576000 2016-09-07 03:46:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Big corporate media is terminally broken. NYT, CNN, NBC, Fox all doing a terrible job reporting this election. (1/2)https://twitter.com/NormOrnstein/status/773727893855830016
773727210913927169 2016-09-07 03:38:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't see how he can look at himself in mirror. He's in same league as @seanhannity @oreillyfactor. NBC should replace w/@megynkelly (2/2)
773726105173831680 2016-09-07 03:34:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> Tonight's forum w/NBC's @MLauer was an absolute disgrace. He is not a journalist - worst softball interview w/Trump I've seen (1/2)
773665418649047040 2016-09-07 23:33:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> Again I am reminded of the Law & Order episode where husband & wife each accuse the other of murder & both get offhttps://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/773581620074913794
773582968451244032 2016-09-07 18:05:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> Why headphone cords suck 1. Connection fail risk at both ends 2. Cords=flimsy & easily damaged 3. Untangling is pain 4. Jack let's in water
773572432405811200 2016-09-07 17:23:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't mean to sound ungrateful but what I really need is longer battery lifehttps://twitter.com/iphoneteam/status/773571394412113920
773571823233478656 2016-09-07 17:21:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo veteran islanders reporter then
773571497025691648 2016-09-07 17:19:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stuartpstevens you are crushing it - love following you
773571330377519105 2016-09-07 17:19:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo is it in Nassau? Very promising. We need an Islanders beat reporter to help.

773402786558017536 2016-09-06 06:09:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pmarca maybe watching TV
773394799311331329 2016-09-06 05:37:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Maidenberg maybe something less geo-based, like The Big Hate. State vs. The Bigot. I gotta think more.
773393625396940802 2016-09-06 05:33:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Maidenberg For first debate I'm going to a party w/a bunch of Quora folks. We should talk party for 2nd debate - Sun Oct 9.
773390839359864833 2016-09-06 05:21:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> First debate on 9/26 is going to be epic. It needs a nickname - Rumble in the Jungle, etc. But nothing rhymes with Hofstra.
773356518183833604 2016-09-06 03:05:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RickFrenkel I'm just saying in the grand scheme of things
773356068877414400 2016-09-06 03:03:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> Whether the iPhone 7 has a headphone jack doesn't seem so important this year
773201438914654210 2016-09-06 16:49:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> Eric Trump may have correctly used the word ironichttps://twitter.com/politico/status/773201114242187264
773200503270367233 2016-09-06 16:45:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> If no one does, then Hillary should find an opportunity to raise it proactively. Trump's birtherism is at the center of his evil. (2/2)
773200276601708544 2016-09-06 16:44:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> Yeah it's Important that one of the debate mods pushes Trump on birther question (1/2) https://twitter.com/jbouie/status/773199712459644928
773157346071543809 2016-09-06 13:54:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ShaneGoldmacher what's the reason?
773030326792630272 2016-09-05 05:29:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisamccoy huh, I've never seen this. I can't imagine outsourcing my thought-chopping to someone else
773029736826011648 2016-09-05 05:27:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's out of fashion to say this, but as a heavy writer I prefer authoring on desktop, not iPhone
773029390183571456 2016-09-05 05:25:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisamccoy cool, OK appreciate the feedback. Yeah I like the tweetstorm feedback. Stay tuned
773026974939828228 2016-09-05 05:16:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @chrisamccoy about Twitter and algorithmic feed? It's pretty much a one-tweet thought - I'd like to see more algo ranking / curating of feed
773024946108796928 2016-09-05 05:08:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> When it's slow news time (eg now), that's when algorithmic stories are great. Twitter's less great when u hit timeline & nothing's going on
772857428866052096 2016-09-05 18:02:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sahilkapur @daveweigel consume != click. Platforms can learn this.
772647319456002048 2016-09-04 04:07:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @owillis the Times is big on anecdotes to support pre-chosen narratives

771461409259433984 2016-09-01 21:35:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RadioFreeTom you were right
771458866441625600 2016-09-01 21:25:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanaSchwartzzz When someone used it on Quora it was invariably used in an insulting comment
771458760405463040 2016-09-01 21:24:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DanaSchwartzzz It's a condescending put-down. I wouldn't characterize it as "least insulting insult ever" but agree it's not toxic.
771452937633574912 2016-09-01 21:01:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's great that global leader like @EPN can stand up & silence @realDonaldTrump. Lack of Trump response is cowardly.https://twitter.com/EPN/status/771423919978913792
771452081534144513 2016-09-01 20:58:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> Shameful that @realDonaldTrump doesn't have guts to stand-up to Mexico's President on Twitter; I guess new campaign team has muzzled him
771450527624245248 2016-09-01 20:51:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JeffersonObama @Nate_Cohn Doesn't it make sense to show 4 way? Because that's who will be on actual ballots (?)
771449777032601600 2016-09-01 20:48:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hughhewitt ayiyi Hugh. You are getting closer to Hannity and Roger Stone with tweets like this.
771448787877306369 2016-09-01 20:44:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> love twitterhttps://twitter.com/epn/status/771423919978913792
771442546178351104 2016-09-01 20:20:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> not remorsefulhttps://twitter.com/pastormarkburns/status/771428063670394880
771417482078720000 2016-09-01 18:40:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Not sure what to conclude generally, but excoriating the media for "doing a bad job" isn't useful. (8/8)
771417393113346048 2016-09-01 18:40:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> In other words, traditional media coverage is not likely to get better from here. (7/8)
771417284946513920 2016-09-01 18:39:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> And ad competition / rate pressure from algorithmic tech mediacos who deliver real results to advertisers (eg, FB, Google). (6/8)
771417132928159744 2016-09-01 18:39:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> Paid media remains an industry under siege. Tons of competition from free media / social media / blogs. (5/8)
771417019925180416 2016-09-01 18:38:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> Another key point: social media is becoming more & more important. 1/2 of news content I read originates on Twitter. (4/8)
771416908792942592 2016-09-01 18:38:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Reality: Trump is super-engaging. The best TV in US politics maybe ever. He gets conflict, drama, character (3/8)
771416826521657344 2016-09-01 18:37:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> There is no "media" -> it's many reporters, networks, publishers trying to create high-quality & engaging products (2/8)
771416663535214592 2016-09-01 18:37:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> "The media's doing a terrible job" theme is a hot take, but this is the wrong characterization of reality (1/8)https://twitter.com/fawfulfan/status/770974898416128001
771375431702282240 2016-09-01 15:53:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @a16z @RolfeWinkler @EricNewcomer no crime to have returns below Benchmark and Sequoia

771225953636757504 2016-08-31 05:59:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @liamstack @christinawilkie I imagine it is not easy to explain complex ideas to Eric
771225287291830272 2016-08-31 05:56:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> Same point here:https://twitter.com/JamilSmith/status/771182518393380866
771220309705830401 2016-08-31 05:37:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> Frustrating - everyone talking about economic stagnation as a problem, but both candidates radio silent re educationhttps://twitter.com/weeklystandard/status/771219582535077888
771169415454859264 2016-08-31 02:14:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @amyjrosenberg my sense is that shinola isn't getting traction. For one thing, the location doesn't have much natural retail foot traffic.
771154577831833600 2016-08-31 01:15:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @amyjrosenberg Michelle (my wife) just confirmed - packed during day
771147426199547904 2016-08-31 00:47:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @amyjrosenberg It's packed whenever I'm there during lunchtime.

771100625970929665 2016-08-31 21:41:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> This seems like a clear win for Trump. Dwelling on fact that he didn't raise the issue of Mexico paying for the wall - doesn't make sense.
771090455190568960 2016-08-31 21:01:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> This session with @bgurley is really goodhttps://www.quora.com/session/Bill-Gurley/1
771058652220305408 2016-08-31 18:54:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Maidenberg Mmm. Not sure you are right. Sweetgreen for sure feels like a home run.
771058370170146816 2016-08-31 18:53:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jpodhoretz are there no news bureaus in Mexico City? NYT, LAT, etc.
771058101080297472 2016-08-31 18:52:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> The success of Lemonade & Sweetgreen in Palo Alto is a good signal for how capitalism will respond to the demand for plant-centric diets
771037290059530240 2016-08-31 17:29:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr I'd say he's masterful except for non-stop lies which are easily fact-checked - doesn't work on social media
771036643801174016 2016-08-31 17:27:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> This writer (@johnastoehr) is must-follow. Epic intelligent tweetstorms re election. We live in a post-blog world.https://twitter.com/johnastoehr/status/771020921389871104
771036143471034368 2016-08-31 17:25:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr The importance of authenticity is what makes social media so different. This is why kids like Bernie.
771035848275931137 2016-08-31 17:24:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr Right. Lincoln (wrote directly in newspapers) -> FDR (radio) -> Reagan (TV) -> X (social/hybrid media)
771035440623128577 2016-08-31 17:22:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr Less dependency on reporters/networks. But this only works if you are very effective at connecting directly.
771032455092408320 2016-08-31 17:10:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr This is clearly where world is going - more power in the hands of principals themselves if they know how to use it.
771032014451412992 2016-08-31 17:08:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr Most effective solution: candidates need to disintermediate traditional media by communicating directly w/ppl via social media

770864426396155906 2016-08-30 06:02:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @NYMag this news is old
770840202881277952 2016-08-30 04:26:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SopanDeb @jonfavs this has confused Twitter broadly
770826345416826880 2016-08-30 03:31:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> that he is a charlatan who is trying to run to the center in 8 weeks
770824943634231296 2016-08-30 03:26:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump going to Mexico to negotiate compromise feels like Nixon going to China, but w/the transformation happening over 1 yr vs Nixon's 30.

770817377969725440 2016-08-30 02:55:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy I'm trying to come up with most parsimonious theory!
770815522501824512 2016-08-30 02:48:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> This hypothesis explains all: Trump obsessed w/daily media cycle, as if campaign=reality TV show. Goal: high ratingshttps://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/770814684744208384
770772507225751552 2016-08-30 23:57:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm skeptical that jury duty was the real reason why @taylorswift13 skipped the MTV Video Music Awardshttps://www.quora.com/Why-wasn%E2%80%99t-Taylor-Swift-present-at-the-2016-MTV-Video-Music-Awards/answer/Marc-Bodnick?srid=pg&share=5491b8a8
770729233312133120 2016-08-30 21:05:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't really care about Hillary and Trump disclosing health records. I'm not sure that makes sense, but I suspect others feel similarly.
770728670801506304 2016-08-30 21:03:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> Super interesting question https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Why-has-Ivanka-Trump-gone-into-radio-silence?srid=pg&share=a240e8b1

770401221211402240 2016-08-29 23:22:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KaraCalavera flunked out - for real?
770389349980594176 2016-08-29 22:35:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> Increasingly I only read headline/tweet & don't click to article. Doesn't reflect well on me but I'd rather stay in timeline flow.

770377001056149504 2016-08-29 21:46:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kampeas the guy is toxic; nobody wants to be associated with him. Plus I assume he isn't Joyce Carol Oates re hockey
770376534704041984 2016-08-29 21:44:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonfavs you should host a Quora session. @JoshMalina's session today is one of my favorites. https://www.quora.com/Did-any-members-of-The-West-Wing-cast-initially-object-to-Joshua-Malina-starting-the-West-Wing-Weekly-podcast-How-did-that-get-resolved/answer/Joshua-Malina-1?srid=pg&share=89ced42b

770336748849147904 2016-08-29 19:06:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @block_sandra yes that's what I mean. Or rando personal opinions. I dislike that stuff.

770336376348741632 2016-08-29 19:04:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> An algorithmic feed might be good because it could show me high-quality tweets from celeb writers but filter out the boring personal crap
770335533121671169 2016-08-29 19:01:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Moments are great for discovering this stuff, but why should I need Moments at all? I'd much rather discover this content in feed.
770334701890342912 2016-08-29 18:57:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> I want to keep up w/celebrity gossip on Twitter, but without following writers who tell me about their personal life a lot. Huge challenge.

770319333058760704 2016-08-29 17:56:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> As an active Twitter reader I'd like a more algorithmic feed. W/time ordered feed if I'm off grid 3+ hrs, I can completely miss a news cycle

768930081129451520 2016-08-25 21:56:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey I'm merely observing that you tweeted 10x about the speech - 8 negative tweets, 1 arguably positive (although "jarring"), 1 neutral
768929674097336320 2016-08-25 21:54:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sallykohn This misses the point. Trump doesn't have to understand Sharia; his goal is to say anti-Islamic things that supporters agree w/
768928524874821632 2016-08-25 21:50:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey not a single one of your tweets is positive about Hillary's speech today - I guess you didn't like it
768927780813758464 2016-08-25 21:47:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> Good for HIllary to go after Trump straight-up & otherize him on national stage. Kerry, Dukakis didn't have her gutshttps://twitter.com/JamilSmith/status/768888851880415232
768921643187998720 2016-08-25 21:23:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JamesFallows In your first tweet, I thought you were coming down negatively on the speech. This ending is like an O'Henry story.
768918025114267648 2016-08-25 21:08:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CraigSJ where?
768917496682250240 2016-08-25 21:06:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BresPolitico zero chance; can't have both Trump and a shutdown.
768909897618423809 2016-08-25 20:36:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> I gotta watch this Hillary speech tonight! Good to know it's short.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/768904362211086336
768875086132580353 2016-08-25 18:18:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JGregRichardson I watched ad & it doesn't seem low to me (of course I'm biased). IOW I don't think typical pastor would think ad is unfair
768865754682789888 2016-08-25 17:40:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Shouldn't be surprising bc the world's big, but it's remarkable that Trump has African-American pastor as supporterhttps://twitter.com/alivitali/status/768848234362044416
768838189763076096 2016-08-25 15:51:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois it's such an obviously desperate & unprincipled move which results in a frankenstein rhetorical/ideological position

768833908863401984 2016-08-25 15:34:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> I still don't get why Trump ended up needing amnesty to pivot. Like applying tourniquet to ripped off limb after you ripped it off yourself

768664094220046336 2016-08-24 04:19:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> Re amnesty shift, Trump's nonstop gratuitous racism put him in spot where he now needs to compromise a core policy commitment to move needle
768654698404466688 2016-08-24 03:42:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidplouffe totally disagree. Even if there is only 10% Trump risk, this is the most dramatic and dangerous race in decades

768501458928934912 2016-08-24 17:33:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter desktop notifs so slow and glitchy compared to Facebook's. I wonder why they can't fix that.
768501246403579904 2016-08-24 17:32:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ThomasHCrown yeah I was thinking that too. Batman Begins & TDK are 2 of most entertaining commercial films over past 20 yrs
768492943283851266 2016-08-24 16:59:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter should offer an Instant Articles product - would make overall experience much better & could turbocharge engagement
768488208157986816 2016-08-24 16:40:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ThomasHCrown have you seen Sausage Party? Best original big-budget movie I've seen this year.

768485029286600704 2016-08-24 16:28:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo so ripping off the bandaid & getting going with wireless sound feels like right move even if it means 18mos of transition pain
768483503025512450 2016-08-24 16:21:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo headphone cord is super-annoying & often undermines sound quality bc 1/the cord is damaged or 2/either end of cord has connect flaw
768482667142615040 2016-08-24 16:18:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ThomasHCrown in general I agree, but there have been just enough successes (last yr's Mad Max; Ocean's 11) for studios to delude themselves
768480881811927040 2016-08-24 16:11:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> Long articles that I need to click off to often feel like optional supplements. Many times main pts of article are reposted widely in tweets
768480448875900928 2016-08-24 16:09:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm guessing ~half the good news content I read is in tweets (often from reporters), not the underlying posted articles by the reporters
768478576605659137 2016-08-24 16:02:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JRubinBlogger I get it. But if you spend any time thinking how gen elec voters differs vs primaries, it doesn't make sense.
768475231702822912 2016-08-24 15:49:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JRubinBlogger but my point is that the thesis was so obviously implausible either he's 1/crazy or 2/self-destructive
768474840881778688 2016-08-24 15:47:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JRubinBlogger but if he's going to soften now, crazy not to have done it earlier
768473744352251905 2016-08-24 15:43:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump's decision to not pivot earlier is a complete mystery -- totally irrationalhttps://twitter.com/JRubinBlogger/status/768473128842436608
768473533940846592 2016-08-24 15:42:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JRubinBlogger this strategy would've maybe worked had he started in May, after primaries. Really hard to understand why he didn't do this
768472602557816832 2016-08-24 15:38:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> No reason for Trump to have raised this - if he'd laid low nobody would be talking about his about his old crazy gastroenterologist note
768470823191457794 2016-08-24 15:31:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump emphasis on Hillary health = irrational given T comical medical letter. Supports he-doesn't-want-to-win thesishttps://twitter.com/JamesFallows/status/768265661785239553

767807540008673281 2016-08-22 19:35:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @kimmaicutler terrible news
767784492018696192 2016-08-22 18:04:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> I have to start watching @Morning_Joehttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/767683204039974912
767775324708802560 2016-08-22 17:27:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> If you are a power news reader, it is irrational to use anything other than Twitter as your primary platform
767775062258618368 2016-08-22 17:26:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter may not seem dominant, but power readers likely acct for 80% of news consumption & Twitter must be taking big share of that audience

767048359794188288 2016-08-20 17:19:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hard to overemphasize how terrible @CLewandowski_ & @PaulManafort were as CMs. The incompetence risk w/Trump is overshadowed, but it's huge.
766848176502415360 2016-08-19 04:03:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey why is this interesting?
766733893114351617 2016-08-19 20:29:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pt @rsarver doesn't the law say that political ads need to make it clear that the candidate paid for the ad?
766683989859893248 2016-08-19 17:11:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump is both: 1. At bleeding edge of modern social media: what FDR was to radio  2. PT Barnum dinosaur re old school lying/smoke&mirrors
766682422939451392 2016-08-19 17:05:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @YG can you answer this - https://www.quora.com/In-FDT-Pt-2-what-does-YG-mean-by-Ivanka-can-get-it?srid=pg&share=d5ac826c
766676468726243329 2016-08-19 16:41:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> I wonder if White House told Trump that Manafort couldn't join the security briefings & that was part of what led to Manafort being fired
766673784199720960 2016-08-19 16:30:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @mobile_reach @sbyrnes @pt banning third party support makes no sense for multiple reasons
766666218203852800 2016-08-19 16:00:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @mobile_reach @sbyrnes @pt yeah jeez 99+% of time the problem is that a rich corp w deep pockets outspends/outwaits an individual
766643195723689985 2016-08-19 14:29:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @realDonaldTrump @davidaxelrod good one

766505213859540993 2016-08-18 05:20:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> It will be difficult to share and partake in the world's knowledge without Gawker
766504060866273281 2016-08-18 05:16:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> .@BillKristol comes out of this election looking very principled. There are so few senior Republicans who declared against Trump.
766493224642813952 2016-08-18 04:33:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @pt The NYT didn't violate anyone's privacy with their Iraq reporting
766493017544863744 2016-08-18 04:32:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @mobile_reach @pt exactly
766492865480368130 2016-08-18 04:31:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @pt @mobile_reach my impression is that the idea that people helping to fund a lawsuit must be non-anonymous -> would be new law
766492037361246208 2016-08-18 04:28:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @pt @mobile_reach So anyone who helps financially support a plaintiff should be treated as "the accuser"?
766491887830118400 2016-08-18 04:28:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @mobile_reach @pt My impression is that many people think that Peter's funding of the suit was wrong / shouldn't be allowed, etc.
766491009488347136 2016-08-18 04:24:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @pt @mobile_reach so the problem isn't that Peter Thiel funded the suit, but that the jury made an incorrect decision?
766489629453279232 2016-08-18 04:19:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mathewi @pt what confuses me: do ppl think law gawker was found to have violated is bad law, or are ppl more upset that the suit was funded
766449848694341633 2016-08-18 01:40:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> I love tweets, headlines characterizing Trump apology-speech as stunning admission. Obviously calculated, insincere.https://twitter.com/ByronYork/status/766449061213921280

766422477761228800 2016-08-18 23:52:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT yeah we'd be in a totally different place minus the last month
766421861022302208 2016-08-18 23:49:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheeEdge yeah the language was probably negotiated as part of her agreement to come on board
766421345924026368 2016-08-18 23:47:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Jeez if Trump can hold the pivot through the first debate, who knows. Maybe it could be a new ballgame. Unlikely but this thing isn't over.

766012589612544000 2016-08-17 20:43:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> He seems most focused on feeding & stoking his Base - maybe with goal of staying the ideological leader of that base over next decade (2/2)
766012233549615104 2016-08-17 20:42:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> The idea that Trump really doesn't want to win should be taken seriously. (1/2)

764621485189140480 2016-08-13 00:35:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Remarkable that Trump doesn't get that "I was just joking" won't work in the general election the way it worked in the primaries

764492096350789633 2016-08-13 16:01:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> If Release Radar works (and mine looks great), it will give Spotify a ton more leverage vs. the labels / blockbuster new releases.

763518144174436352 2016-08-10 23:31:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Journalists should explain dogwhistle pattern explicitly to mainstream readers: - KKK non-disavow - Megyn Kelly blood - 2A assassination

762007146313682944 2016-08-06 19:27:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alexrkonrad @MikeIsaac @fmanjoo IMO $3B would be a massive, blockbuster outcome. Bigger than Waze, Instagram (!), Zappos, YouTube (!)

761613040299175936 2016-08-05 17:21:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel @BecketAdams I don't understand the comparison with Trump
761594941726347264 2016-08-05 16:09:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel @thehill thanks for clarifying that
761590729026199553 2016-08-05 15:52:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't even think it's crazy to imagine @kanyewest being in the top 5 in a future nom race - you just need to poll 5% to make the debates
761590352381939716 2016-08-05 15:51:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> A well-known name and 5+million Twitter followers creates a platform that didn't exist pre-social media

761307575753248768 2016-08-04 21:07:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Nate_Cohn @charlescwcooke Not surprising - same thing happened in 1992. A reasonably decent 3rd party candidate keeps the winner below 50.
761306880979468289 2016-08-04 21:04:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey another reason pundits don't like rigging accusations is because they are often wrong
761284522457632768 2016-08-04 19:35:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Clarknt67 you don't think it's plausible that Trump released the photos? Sounded reasonable to me.
761282392258740224 2016-08-04 19:27:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hence the truckloads of cash driven into the bonfire of clickbait content companies
761282206421712896 2016-08-04 19:26:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Businesspeople often don't want to know the core truth of user-generated content -- technology-driven advantage is what wins
761281996257648640 2016-08-04 19:25:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Businesspeople love clickbait strategies because (1) they "understand" them and (2) they can hire people who can implement them.
761280987867275264 2016-08-04 19:21:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> Facebook's punishment of clickbait headlines will further reveal how low-value clickbait content is. It's a commodity.
761274917144920066 2016-08-04 18:57:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo I don't think NYT, AP or Techmeme is the problem...

761213639911206915 2016-08-04 14:54:09 UTC <MarcBodnick> This week revealed: Trump's base = anti-military/vet; should've been apparent from attacks on McCain. "You think yer better than me?" etc.

760925766498586624 2016-08-03 19:50:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> The craziest thing about this Khan/Trump conflagration is that Trump could have ignored it

760419214993874948 2016-08-02 10:17:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tribelaw this is somewhat less of a risk given that many Rs don't support Trump or are lukewarm (1/2)

760194110196178944 2016-08-01 19:22:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> Reading a tweetstorm is surprisingly enjoyable, especially if you are a power Twitter user. Nice not to leave feed.
760193864292507652 2016-08-01 19:21:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> Tweetstorms have been exploding in my feed over the past few mos, esp in politics. Seems like significant threat to straight blog platforms

759876137946222592 2016-07-31 22:19:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hughhewitt @sahilkapur I think it's safe to assume that Trump will pick conventional conservative justices
759876041187876866 2016-07-31 22:19:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @hughhewitt @sahilkapur Pres Trump 1) will optimize for reelect, 2) will want to avoid '20 primary challenge, 3) doesn't care about SCOTUS:
759827467280408577 2016-07-31 19:05:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @harryglaser I'm assuming that he is roughly rational
759508435708829696 2016-07-30 21:58:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> Alt hypothesis: Trump doesn't want to be President, but... he likes the power (now/future) of commanding this huge white working class bloc
759483439901007872 2016-07-30 20:18:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> Debate system isn't rigged against Trump; he put himself in a bad position by being a terrible person & taking so many obnoxious positions
759482503178706949 2016-07-30 20:15:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> The system wasn't rigged against Bernie; he screwed up by not reaching out to African-Americans
759482296110084096 2016-07-30 20:14:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> "The system is rigged" is often an excuse to avoid personal responsibility
759368708607410176 2016-07-30 12:43:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @joshtpm @block_sandra yep. I still don't think he'll back out
759245236040298502 2016-07-29 04:32:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Zero chance Trump skips the debates - he can't look like a chickensh-t to his base

759125730915655680 2016-07-29 20:37:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SethAMandel @ThomasHCrown the Post is a pretty important newspaper to do something like this. I guess I should know better.
759124156810158080 2016-07-29 20:31:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ThomasHCrown @SethAMandel I usually love the Post, but this is ridiculous. How is this the main point to make re last night's speech?
759123329747939328 2016-07-29 20:28:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jonathanchait @HillaryKelly most such criticisms (at least sig plurality) = pretty sexist; same style in a man would be critic'd much less
759117234753142784 2016-07-29 20:03:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey what is the evidence beyond your anecdotes that it's gaining currency?
759111584589447168 2016-07-29 19:41:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jameshritz I'm not saying this will work, but it does seem like the most sensible interpretation of his behavior
759111195320254464 2016-07-29 19:39:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> In other words, staying angry, mean & extreme is purposeful turnout strategy, vs. expand the coalition / go-to-the-center
759110870559498240 2016-07-29 19:38:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> (2) This is why he isn't moderating himself, not pivoting into the center.
759110766993760257 2016-07-29 19:38:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> Theory:  (1) Trump's strategy is focused on record-breaking turnout from resentful white voters (i.e., his base).
759106806744506368 2016-07-29 19:22:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Much of Trump's core base (~1/2 his support) is OK w/bullying. Rationale: we need this type of leader/personality to deal w/ISIS, threats

759055934513479681 2016-07-29 16:00:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @natbro I don't think that was a decision - they couldn't deny his candidacy
759055650290663424 2016-07-29 15:59:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @benshapiro jeez you are super-grumpy this morning
759055227618140160 2016-07-29 15:57:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> Would be much better for Republicans if Paul Ryan hadn't endorsed Trump. Who is the credible leadership of the party now?
759049219772514304 2016-07-29 15:33:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @emilynussbaum the scenes of her talking in the kitchen were generally great
759046710626775040 2016-07-29 15:23:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @stuartpstevens @realDonaldTrump I don't get it (?)
759046065840541700 2016-07-29 15:20:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> Not done. Trump will post a dogwhistle antisemitic tweet re Bloomberg - T's base won't be satisfied w/anything lesshttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/759025610249216000
758907125456252928 2016-07-28 06:08:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> Key to remember: ~35% of Trump's ~45% will vote for him even if it turns out that he's Satan. Those people can be ignored by Hillary.
758879462775595009 2016-07-28 04:18:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump promoting tweets - seeing this for first time todaypic.twitter.com/x4Wg4zgF4o
758869934663356416 2016-07-28 03:41:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> My speech ranking: 1. Hillary 2. Bloomberg 3. Michelle Obama  These are the addresses that best made the case to an independent voter
758866377255944192 2016-07-28 03:26:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> For first time, I'm starting to think independents might vote for HRC w same pride we had in 08 when we voted for Obama - b/c it's American
758862199787970560 2016-07-28 03:10:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> She has completely coopted Bernie, without exposing vulnerability on her left - great execution
758861506549125121 2016-07-28 03:07:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Looking back it's now clear that Trump went Tin Cup in his convention speech - so much crazy risk
758858994542706690 2016-07-28 02:57:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @edbott sure but I think Trump has really helped
758858436104769536 2016-07-28 02:55:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Sane and competent - that's the reassuring feeling I have listening to this
758857204665425920 2016-07-28 02:50:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> With the white outfit this feels like a good vs evil pep talk
758856628393226241 2016-07-28 02:48:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> "It Takes a Village" now implies inclusiveness, tolerance, & working together - not statism. Big change.
758855618396512256 2016-07-28 02:44:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> Incredible that the Democrats have co-opted patriotism. And it's Hillary that's doing it, not Obama or Bill.
758854288533655554 2016-07-28 02:38:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @CGasparino seems pretty appealing to me
758853482992414720 2016-07-28 02:35:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> Convention-on-convention, this is a massive beatdown. Insane execution by Hillary's campaign.
758825185109692417 2016-07-28 00:43:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ChrisMegerian yeah. It's because they are coming to understand that everyone thinks Hillary is the strongest opponent to Trump, not Bernie
758824717839052800 2016-07-28 00:41:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Pretty awesome - Twitter should bump a tweet to the top if one high-follower person I follow responds to anotherhttps://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/758781081072046080
758822242041999362 2016-07-28 00:31:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> Romney and other business leaders should be pounding the table for Trump's tax returns - more credible than Dem pols doing it
758797421354717185 2016-07-28 22:52:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> He should have endorsed Hillary earlier & spent more time consoling his supporters rather than extracting meaningless platform concessions
758797334675206144 2016-07-28 22:52:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> Bernie is personally responsible for his supporters' destructive behavior
758791863109230592 2016-07-28 22:30:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Propane Jane is one of the most important writers on the lefthttps://twitter.com/docrocktex26/status/700441276890492928
758760595223183361 2016-07-28 20:26:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> @patcaldwell are you saying that is a fair response, or inadequate? Those 3 speeches did seem targeted to working class issues
758753347608469506 2016-07-28 19:57:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sm why is that the biggest impact you can make?
758726340300464130 2016-07-28 18:10:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> Donald Trump Jr. is the dumbest close advisor to either of the two candidateshttps://twitter.com/irin/status/758725861591965696
758714518130262016 2016-07-28 17:23:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> I heard a rumor at the convention that Laura Bush may endorse Hillary. Bloomberg's "country over party" speech is giving R VIPs air cover.
758712734204788736 2016-07-28 17:16:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> Well-known hacker @6 says that the @wikileaks Twitter account is probably run by @JulianAssange_ himself.   https://www.quora.com/Who-runs-WikiLeaks%E2%80%99-Twitter-account/answer/Adri%C3%A1n-Lamo
758711658122469376 2016-07-28 17:12:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> Based on what I've seen at DNC: @GabbyGiffords = most effective face of the gun safety movement. She is legit, authentic, inspiring.
758520702865670144 2016-07-27 04:33:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @emilynussbaum no, the Bernie people were cranky/booing Hilary's military/intelligence proxies (Panetta, Hutson)
758491478129774592 2016-07-27 02:37:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> Kaine is a lot like Biden but more modern - authentic, grounded, more worldly
758481574916661248 2016-07-27 01:57:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> I wonder if right way to position Trump is  Crazy In bed w/Russians Not that successful in business  Seems better vs liar racist misogynist
758472483456610304 2016-07-27 01:21:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey this is important?
758465778182217728 2016-07-27 00:55:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> Re the protests/chanting, I think what's happening is that Bernie supporters are heckling Hillary's military/intelligence proxies
758461856109518848 2016-07-27 00:39:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson told ya. Pre-prime time is for base.

758454933339254784 2016-07-27 00:12:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson nobody is paying attention, and everything pre-prime time will be overshadowed by the '27 Yankees on deck
758443564242046976 2016-07-27 23:26:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> There are very few rising stars in either party
758434292951347202 2016-07-27 22:50:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> I guess the reason Dem speakers don't mention security/ISIS is that they control the exec branch & they don't want to be critical, but...
758428694159425536 2016-07-27 22:27:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> My daughter Maya answers: What was it like to watch Bill Clinton's speech at the 2016 convention? https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-watch-Bill-Clintons-speech-at-the-2016-convention/answer/Maya-Bodnick?srid=pg&share=98a6b1eb
758290410246594560 2016-07-27 13:18:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey it is absolutely not close to level of hostility at GOP conv - lock her up, etc. Last night's main speakers barely mentioned Trump.
758289927226351616 2016-07-27 13:16:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey but you said "now roughly equals GOP convention's obsession w/ HRC."  To me that isn't close to right in quantity or quality.
758289341181419520 2016-07-27 13:14:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey this is not consistent with the speeches I saw last night.
758108563084484609 2016-07-26 01:15:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy they've got me penciled in after Ivana
758108096640147457 2016-07-26 01:13:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> This place is packed - you can't find a seat except those behind the podium
758081823696154624 2016-07-26 23:29:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo one possibility is that growth metrics don't tell the full story of how a company is doing
758081178457038848 2016-07-26 23:26:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Landed in Philadelphia
758078515971522560 2016-07-26 23:16:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump needs to put Ivanka in charge of Russian crisis comms before Donald Jr gives away the storehttps://twitter.com/stevenjay/status/758075398315974657
758072934309036033 2016-07-26 22:54:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ikirigin no good reason. Newspaper opeds have nearly zero share of influence on Twitter which is where most print elite discussion occurs

758056271497101318 2016-07-26 21:47:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> DNC programming last night & today so far - masterful handling of the Sanders energy / crankinesshttps://twitter.com/danpfeiffer/status/758055467838996480

758040863087943680 2016-07-26 20:46:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump followers love it when he calls Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas. He & his base are disgraceful - degrade all of ushttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/757919034755076096
758036870647386113 2016-07-26 20:30:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @patcaldwell fwiw, shazam isn't going to work in an arena
757951902424248321 2016-07-26 14:53:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @shitHRCcantsay topics I'd like to hear about: ISIS / Trump's view, Melania's speech, Donald J Trump Jr., Mike Pence, the nazi RTs
757937540481421312 2016-07-26 13:56:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @johnastoehr great post series
757797437272535041 2016-07-25 04:39:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Yeah I don't mean Elizabeth Warren-style knife fighting. Simply more of what we saw tonight (with Trump called out by  name) would be fine.
757795937708224512 2016-07-25 04:33:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Final thought: it sure looks like FLOTUS could run for office or have meaningful role in an H WH; my idea would give everyone a test drive
757795393459490821 2016-07-25 04:31:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BrettRichey because she cares about the country
757794707321688064 2016-07-25 04:28:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> P.S. This would be so awkward for Trump given how unimpressive Melania is.
757794520612245504 2016-07-25 04:27:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> This would put Trump in a bind; he hates to be attacked/interact w/strong smart women. Would politicize FLOTUS but might be worth it. (2/2)
757794162141908993 2016-07-25 04:26:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hillary campaign could ask @FLOTUS to go on the road as an aggressive proxy, leading attacks against Trump -- like @elizabethforma. (1/2)
757715091232067585 2016-07-25 23:12:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KaraCalavera really great - you are a terrific writer. Thanks for spending the time to post this.
757673874041569280 2016-07-25 20:28:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BuzzFeedAndrew @AriFleischer another problem - the speech was super-dark
757671323833405440 2016-07-25 20:18:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jaredkrouss it's pretty consistent for me
757670688002039809 2016-07-25 20:15:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> BTW, this isn't good for Pandora, radio, etc.
757670487933775872 2016-07-25 20:14:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> As music listener, holy grail may be in sight: related songs & really good automated browsing. Until recently, ML wasn't good enough.
757669399155310592 2016-07-25 20:10:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> Lessening dependence on head content means less risk of being held hostage by exclusives/new releases, labels, individual artists
757668763617595392 2016-07-25 20:08:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is a potentially huge for the company. Discover Weekly may be as important a product as Spotify itself was in '08/09.
757668316592963584 2016-07-25 20:06:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> Spotify's Discover Weekly is now better for me than my favorite DJ-curated playlist (Rap Caviar). ML/personalization > editorial.
757453838798327808 2016-07-24 05:54:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey @MrMacMan have you read the NYTimes coverage of this story?
757445032257413121 2016-07-24 05:19:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey I don't see it. Idea that the Russian govt hacked network of 1 of our 2 major parties in effort to disrupt our election - big deal
757444317111840768 2016-07-24 05:16:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mtracey I don't understand why a journalist would make light of the possible risk of Russian involvement here.

757325336564465664 2016-07-24 21:23:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> This is why new revelations of racist / sexually harassing behavior have zero impact
757323816108306432 2016-07-24 21:17:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> The root of Trump's teflon: his core supporters know he's a strongman-villain and they are down with that

757100431931691008 2016-07-23 06:29:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheRickWilson Isn't weird to me. 2 media themes from the convention: (1) lots of disunity; (2) T's speech=super-dark. The ad refutes both.
757085263017279488 2016-07-23 05:29:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin he's not Hitler yet
757084735784886272 2016-07-23 05:27:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin IMO Trump's actions/statements/revelations are much worse. For disclosure, I'm in the Trump-might-be-Hitler camp.
757083862451097600 2016-07-23 05:23:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin feels like short-term loyalty/stay-the-course, w/a subsequent firing to come when the heat is off (presumably after the election)
757083367703621633 2016-07-23 05:21:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'd be shocked if Debbie Wasserman Schultz doesn't get the boot as DNC Chair
757080202614743040 2016-07-23 05:09:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin yeah I had a similar experience recently with the original. But the original is Citizen Kane compared to the new one

756729004367851520 2016-07-22 05:53:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump insults people & makes ad hominem personal attacks all the time.   This isn't a mistake. Trump's supporters like this kind of thing.
756723190877921280 2016-07-22 05:30:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hey Bernie supporters - reminder, as you think about going non-linear: if you undermine Hillary & Trump wins -> that'll be your only legacy
756722231183454208 2016-07-22 05:26:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> With R convention over, Twitter=much quieter/more fragmented. This past week on Twitter=1 of most incredible social media exps I've ever had
756581914920624128 2016-07-22 20:09:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SJVenuto yeah of course me too. But if definitely would have worked in 1988, 1980, 1968. % of Trump-sympathetic voters was much higher then
756581012763611137 2016-07-22 20:05:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> Lucky for us that Trump is running today vs 70s/80s. This populist demagogue white identity campaign could've worked post-LBJ/pre-Clinton
756534360447131648 2016-07-22 17:00:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> I'm coming around to the "You Might Like" feed stories on Twitter - in many cases they are stories I'm glad I didn't miss
756357728453300225 2016-07-21 05:18:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @KateBennett_DC @McCormackJohn no point / not nice to pick on a child who is being put into an uncomfortable situation
756357223689838592 2016-07-21 05:16:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> @UnknownDelegate you've been a terrific contributor. I follow hundreds of politics writers and you are among the best
756356955048861696 2016-07-21 05:15:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin but a man is generally not called on this the way Hillary is
756354960825147392 2016-07-21 05:07:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> One take for me tonight: saying Hillary is always yelling = clearly sexist; Trump yelled thru whole speech (& does so generally)
756335219561627648 2016-07-21 03:49:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> Cruz's address was Lincoln-esque vs. Trump's. Cruz is looking more & more like '76 Reagan.
756321649369026560 2016-07-21 02:55:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> Crowd seems flat vs last night with Cruz
756313224488718336 2016-07-21 02:21:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> A star is born maybe. Ivanka's speech was awesome
756251424288235520 2016-07-21 22:16:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tomgara interesting but that would cost a ton of $$ to lure that talent away before you had the distribution
756250841120579584 2016-07-21 22:13:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maggieNYT @alexburnsNYT @ChrisMegerian @serena_alway good point - ok never mind

756249754242211840 2016-07-21 22:09:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ChrisMegerian @alexburnsNYT @maggieNYT eh I don't think it's fair to criticize Trump for hypocrisy. He's distanced himself from Bush et al
756245966034907136 2016-07-21 21:54:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @agolis yeah crazy if T & team didn't assess 50+% prob to this outcome. Why would guy willing to alienate all GOP ldrs toe line for Trump?
756240691982774272 2016-07-21 21:33:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> Cruz criticized by Trumpkins as lacking grace -what a joke. T attacked appearance of Cs wife, said Cs dad killed JFKhttps://twitter.com/michaelberrysho/status/755963941101064192

756226379012636672 2016-07-21 20:36:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Why has Trump's p(win) increased in @NateSilver538 model, despite the terrible R Convention? https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Why-has-Trumps-probability-of-winning-gone-up-in-Nate-Silvers-model-despite-how-terrible-and-acrimonious-the-Republican-Convention-waspic.twitter.com/cfYV9hOQU7
756219825349722112 2016-07-21 20:10:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @emilynussbaum this is really a terrific piece. Perfectly captures the moment I experienced watching the speech last night
756214616137437184 2016-07-21 19:49:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> @DouthatNYT Voters who voted for Cruz in 16 + [some] Trump voters could easily form winning coalition. Who cares about never-forgive elites?
756204716388782085 2016-07-21 19:10:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack really? Trump would = much change. Mex wall, trade wars all over, changing our posture toward allies, much dif SCOTUS appts v BO
756199140753747970 2016-07-21 18:48:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JonahNRO If it helps, I plan to buy two of your books for my mother. Great post - keep up the good work.
756198447435304960 2016-07-21 18:45:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> In tonight's big speech, Trump will almost certainly address the Ted Cruz elephant in the room. The guy won't let any attack go unanswered.
756197974045134848 2016-07-21 18:43:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack nah, she should lay low on Ted Cruz stuff. No reason to dance on grave. Cruz did his damage; H can't improve position on that

756185155249713152 2016-07-21 17:52:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> One surprise from last night: Cruz signaled he may embrace civil rights as priority - for African-Americans, LBGTQ. Could be LBJ-like move.
756181012447584260 2016-07-21 17:36:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose at a minimum he wants to be perceived as a welcome guest / rookie speaker. no benefit to unpredictability.
756180260371124225 2016-07-21 17:33:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose not sure. guess: pro-freedom. anti-hillary. anti-statist. anti-regulation. & i'd bet a reasonably strong explicit T endorsement

755948502203576320 2016-07-20 02:12:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> That Ted Cruz speech was Churchill-in-the-1930s awesome
755919639738130432 2016-07-20 00:17:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> Once you have tuned up Twitter, there's no reason to go the home pages of your fav news sites. A good Twitter feed crushes it re discovery.
755888606409953280 2016-07-20 22:14:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MarkMWhelan the level of analysis and info I'm getting from Twitter is extraordinary
755648324305350656 2016-07-19 06:19:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @naval You can't have a community where people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts w/strangers without getting rid of the assholes.
755638309947310081 2016-07-19 05:39:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> still the real threat of banning is a powerful force to engender broad social civility
755638250400780288 2016-07-19 05:39:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans if you do it enough, you set norms/expectations that somewhat self-reinforce. Less true where pseudonyms are OK, but...
755637364081496065 2016-07-19 05:36:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @BenedictEvans I don't understand why they don't just publish a clear policy and ban people quicker
755604287535718400 2016-07-19 03:24:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TVMoJoe forgive us if we suspect sloppy plagiarism
755601163915898880 2016-07-19 03:12:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't understand why it took Twitter so long to ban Milo. At Quora we'd have done it soon after seeing the consistently attacking content
755519847195250688 2016-07-19 21:49:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy @Bencjacobs damn ok so I'm not alone in being burned

753633061619642368 2016-07-14 16:51:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois @johnolilly I'd guess that half his support likes the racist/sexist appeal, & he's getting more turnout from these bad ppl vs Romney

751554314909331457 2016-07-08 23:11:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> @TheStalwart @johngapper what's going to replace it?
751552906055135232 2016-07-08 23:05:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @edbott 1 theory - Trump is surrounded by weak advisors (even Manafort); temptation is high to "let Trump be Trump." Newt may be different.
751551880514252800 2016-07-08 23:01:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @edbott I know this is a contrarian view (+ unsupported by data), but I think Trump can moderate if he's convinced it will help him win
751550894655680512 2016-07-08 22:57:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @edbott you are probably right. I wonder if Gingrich has enough stature/credibility to fix.
751550172182614016 2016-07-08 22:54:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> The facts that 1) police have done wrong in LA/MN + 2) no terrorists are involved - likely confusing to Team Trump in debating how 2 exploit
751548051605458944 2016-07-08 22:46:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> Craziest thing re Trump - he's leaving so much $ on the table. Going-to-center pivot is ripe for taking, & he clearly has no problem w/lying
751546392468869120 2016-07-08 22:39:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @PatrickRuffini I don't understand why he hasn't softened his edges - seems like no-brainer. Huge opp for him now
751545924086689792 2016-07-08 22:38:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> Internal debate among Trump, Gingrich, Manafort re how to react must be insane. Gingrich/Manafort begging Trump to go kindler/gentler
751545344903614464 2016-07-08 22:35:47 UTC <MarcBodnick> What Gingrich comments signal: Trump has opp to pivot around shootings- if he can fake empathy/unity, he can exploit voter desire for Change
751519455138549760 2016-07-08 20:52:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jasonlk yeah the comparative reality underlying comms is so good - that's why he's will to take risk
751519068780236800 2016-07-08 20:51:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jasonlk maybe. Those ideas would certainly make near-term comms better. Not sure how much that matters

751138294692392960 2016-07-07 19:38:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> 4/ Pre-Yelp, customers had no recourse. Post-Yelp, public reviews forced transparency and compelled bad local businesses to change.
751138180074573824 2016-07-07 19:37:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> 3/ Somewhat similar to Yelp shining light on bad local biz's
751137649415458816 2016-07-07 19:35:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> 2/ This would change the asymmetric power & information dynamic that exists today
751137354102956032 2016-07-07 19:34:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> 1/ @shervin's idea to have people socially share & publish police interactions seems like a great idea
751135217369292800 2016-07-07 19:26:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @anildash @killerswan @shervin this seems like an immediately actionable idea

749104441769414662 2016-07-01 04:56:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidfickling I don't understand - 130mm miles -> 1 fatality. Human driving half that.
749103890260299776 2016-07-01 04:54:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidfickling but what about this information supports "Silicon Valley forgot about that fact"
749098301169889280 2016-07-01 04:32:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @davidfickling I don't understand the headline given that Tesla has had 1 fatality in 130mm autopilot miles

749009752399630336 2016-07-01 22:40:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tylerwillis ignore may be too strong but I think the focus on platform is silly -- I guess win win because Bernie cares and no 1 else does
749007407179706368 2016-07-01 22:30:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @tylerwillis - no1 cares abt platform - BS bcoming irrelevant irritant/joke w/ungraceful nonexit  - trump=monster; no1 cares what BS wants
749004176181440513 2016-07-01 22:18:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> It's possible that Hillary isn't paying close attention to changes that Bernie (VT senator who ran in primaries) is making to party platform

748917837243179008 2016-07-01 16:35:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ktbenner but is this a surprise? Isn't it clear (i.e. the product makes it clear) that the human needs to be in charge

748896723834064897 2016-07-01 15:11:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> @nealboudette my point is that the headlines are alarmist and ignore the percentages / context

748695362748030976 2016-06-30 01:50:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ktbenner @EricNewcomer @williamalden it means NYC is hurting its potential in tech by having anti-tech laws. Like Austin & ridesharing.

729453648355299328 2016-05-08 23:31:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang @dtunkelang because his target audience now (general election) is bigger / more mainstream / less extreme
729447571001774080 2016-05-08 23:07:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @szorowitz he seems pretty rationally self interested to me
729447505365065729 2016-05-08 23:06:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marlonmisra playing nice at all? I would think his supporters want him to win and would appreciate fact that he's in the pole position
729442733329289216 2016-05-08 22:47:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> Surprising Trump perceives self-interest in alienating Ryan, etc. Light reconciliation wud expand tent/get closer to 51% + look presidential

728679991492280324 2016-05-06 20:17:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hillary should run the anti-Trump ads without the text overlay. Let him hang on his own words without extra marketing.

722226430268956673 2016-04-18 00:52:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> POTUS calling out Saudi Arabia is pretty exciting

720405334544621568 2016-04-13 00:16:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack I don't think that's true. Ppl here have huge respect/gratitude for the specific owners - both as leaders & investors in team.
719920369293852672 2016-04-12 16:09:26 UTC <MarcBodnick> Paul Ryan saying this or that doesn't preclude him being drafted later. Like Trump "committing" 6 mos ago to support nominee if it's not him
719757451877191680 2016-04-11 05:22:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sm I think the real nadir is sometime between 18-24 months. If you think it's 12 months, you can get super-depressed. Also YMMV of course.

719679020627918849 2016-04-11 00:10:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @meat actually I think a lot of progress has been made with reporters (eg @megynkelly @hardball_chris) pushing him hard
719677623610114048 2016-04-11 00:04:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> Media should push Trump to explain incompetence in whiffing on delegate selection process, which is 100% at odds w/"I'm a winner" narrative.
719630063499476993 2016-04-11 20:55:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> I find Ben Carson more interesting as a Trump surrogate than as a real candidate

718528869934870528 2016-04-08 20:00:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> I know this sounds crazy but I think Bernie might win New York
718515656144982016 2016-04-08 19:07:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin I hear you. But I could imagine Hillary and Cruz looking very unappealing come Nov
718508957799555072 2016-04-08 18:40:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin he's an insane execution guy when it comes to campaigns. Who would have thought he'd have been electable as NYC mayor.
718489235569815552 2016-04-08 17:22:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> I wonder if Bloomberg runs if it it's Hillary-Cruz. World doesn't end if MB tips race to C & maybe there's center hole wide enuf 4 B 2 win
718488129728962560 2016-04-08 17:18:13 UTC <MarcBodnick> This might be early or wrong, but it feels like Bernie has a real shot at winning New York

716379782359846912 2016-04-02 21:40:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> The narrative that we are learning new and bad things about Trump is key to Republican efforts to thwart the will of his supporters

716314331105746944 2016-04-02 17:20:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> Making Trump a monster = key to making it OK to give nomination to someone else even if Trump is close to 1237. Otherwise will feel unfair.

709618121691115520 2016-03-14 05:51:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> @alexia yeah, the Facebook analogue is pretty good here. Same thing although that took a lot longer.
709617215406870528 2016-03-14 05:48:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sama it's a sign of permanence - VCs not in SnapChat are giving up the ghost that the company is a fad
709462271454347264 2016-03-14 19:32:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MichelleFields we'd love to have you host a @QuoraSessions - DM me if you are interested?
708492718968680448 2016-03-11 03:20:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> A subreddit with well-defined rules would solve many interaction problems that plague Trump rallies today
708469322511810560 2016-03-11 01:47:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump should move his rallies to reddit

708095828255068165 2016-03-10 01:02:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @MattDickinson44 Hey Matt - would you follow me so I can DM you?
707973871203299328 2016-03-10 16:58:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattangriffel @Quora @onemonthedu @QuoraSessions yep DM me
707637195872428032 2016-03-09 18:40:29 UTC <MarcBodnick> A first for us -- four @QuoraSessions running at the same timepic.twitter.com/B9k3DvhAcG
707616487482089473 2016-03-09 17:18:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> @saarsaar @hunterwalk @rabois another good question for late stage investors is whether the product is any good
705812151697428480 2016-03-04 17:48:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> One of the most depressing things re this election -- very little talk about education.
705798068549980160 2016-03-04 16:52:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> Incredible that I had to explain to my kids the big hands thing last night
705617559547019264 2016-03-03 04:55:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @doog this cycle
705617138468294660 2016-03-03 04:53:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> Fox crushed it tonight. Megyn Kelly & Chris Wallace = best debate moderators to-date.
705614647655690240 2016-03-03 04:43:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Eric_Dykstra my point is that he sees himself as the only one left qualified to be president
705614173762252804 2016-03-03 04:41:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> You can see why Kasich doesn't want to drop out
705566568453795840 2016-03-03 01:32:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> I really admire Romney for sticking his neck out. He knows he's the poster-child for all that Trump supporters hate, but he still did it.
705533443141083136 2016-03-03 23:20:55 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jameshritz idea is that Cruz is done -- can't win any other state left
705531357208846337 2016-03-03 23:12:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Hearing rumors that Cruz drops out next week in return for Rubio committing to appoint him to SCOTUS
705424498309275648 2016-03-03 16:08:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois @hunterwalk @msquinn I'd love Jeffrey Lord's perspective on this
705215500221976578 2016-03-02 02:17:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marcambinder cool - will send you an email tonight
705215258298707969 2016-03-02 02:16:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marcambinder want to host a session?
705175427816361984 2016-03-02 23:38:18 UTC <MarcBodnick> @steveplunkett @btaylor Ayiyi - this response makes no sense. Are you an expert on social networks? Did you read the answer before tweeting?
705058985615855616 2016-03-02 15:55:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sacca Hey Chris - want to host a Quora session? DM me if you're interested
705056594166358017 2016-03-02 15:46:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ezraklein really good
704905915707826176 2016-03-01 05:47:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelrwolfe hah. Clearly Christie. Maybe Kasich, Gingrich.
704902767064850432 2016-03-01 05:34:50 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelrwolfe 4/By the end of that 4-year period, he'd probably be pretty relevant again, to someone. (And by the way, 4 could be 8.)
704902698030768129 2016-03-01 05:34:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelrwolfe 3/ So a 40% shot at a 4-year Cabinet seat doesn't sound too bad.
704902542560501760 2016-03-01 05:33:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelrwolfe 2/ And his prospects as a white-collar litigator are probably static.
704902420221009921 2016-03-01 05:33:28 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelrwolfe 1/"Never works again." He was never going to work again in politics regardless.
704900804478640128 2016-03-01 05:27:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @michaelrwolfe it all depends on whether Trump wins and names him Attorney General
704899719911358465 2016-03-01 05:22:44 UTC <MarcBodnick> John King's map chatter is useless.
704899566949240833 2016-03-01 05:22:07 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump strongly benefits by Kasich staying in the race. Seems plausible that Trump & Kasich have some kind of side deal.
704888950201020416 2016-03-01 04:39:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @I_am_ryan_S @officialmcafee hey John - excited you are on Quora - I've sent you a Quora inbox message. Reply back & I'll help you get going
704171677962235904 2016-02-28 05:09:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @SenSasse we want to invite the Senator to host a @QuoraSessions
704129773249757184 2016-02-28 02:23:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @katieyowyow so good - maybe best ever
704128614917255168 2016-02-28 02:18:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> Prediction: Chris Rock won't be invited back as Oscars host.
704128229158727680 2016-02-28 02:17:06 UTC <MarcBodnick> Chris Rock's no-bullshit hosting is making the canned intros feel especially painful
704123638597832708 2016-02-28 01:58:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Chris Rock was crazy good. I can't remember ever enjoying something like that so much. So honest / straight / blunt.
704078621992886272 2016-02-28 22:59:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @Fullantho @rabois endorsing Trump (as a mainstream US pol) is a sign of how craven & desperate you are
704055900995096576 2016-02-28 21:29:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois did you miss the Le Pen news
704040816331747328 2016-02-28 20:29:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois anti-semitism could be a fresh vein to mine
704038520583643137 2016-02-28 20:20:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @XENOCIDE15 @xenocide15 @sean_a_rose that's my point - it's a feature to a bigger company
703434300587245573 2016-02-26 04:19:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @RusEmbUSA we would like to invite you to host a @QuoraSessions. Can you follow me so we can DM you?

703091074034577408 2016-02-25 05:35:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump's teflon is hard to understand. But if you assume that his supporters aren't really Republicans, it makes sense.
703090513637806080 2016-02-25 05:33:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> I can't imagine Cruz dropping out "for the good of the party"
703090349762179072 2016-02-25 05:32:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois Kasich is the obvious running mate candidate for Trump
703089835708297220 2016-02-25 05:30:54 UTC <MarcBodnick> I wonder if Trump has a side deal with Kasich to keep Kasich in the race
702993437902045185 2016-02-25 23:07:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> In world where Trump may win, who cares about Hillary's Goldman transcripts? Bernie is doomed; time to close ranks against the real monster.
702890903485042688 2016-02-25 16:20:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jasonlk he's the guy who gives you Ohio
702889873628200960 2016-02-25 16:16:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> @jasonlk kasich
702191867501228032 2016-02-23 18:02:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> Update: I predicted Trump wud say something soon re Guantanamo, but today is now the "I want to punch that protester in the face" news cycle
702160334551797762 2016-02-23 15:57:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> Prediction: Trump will say something crazy about Guantanamo
702155021182328832 2016-02-23 15:36:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mims @mathewi that's the canonical answer
702014239762829312 2016-02-22 06:16:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> The Bachelor is really exciting when one of the contestants already has kids. So much riding on the Rose Ceremony.
701898906599186432 2016-02-22 22:38:34 UTC <MarcBodnick> You really have to screw up to be fired by the Cruz campaign
701820851230941184 2016-02-22 17:28:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> With a new CMO & head of communications, Twitter looks like it is firing on all cylinders
700877073728942080 2016-02-19 02:58:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose could be big opp for these companies to expand into URL shortening
700875266629873666 2016-02-19 02:50:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> The standalone gif aggregation category could be vulnerable
700838972319117313 2016-02-19 00:26:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @FBI we want to invite you to host a @QuoraSessions. follow me so I can DM you?
700727763087396865 2016-02-19 17:04:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> Moments 1, 3-5 are very interesting to me. I could start using Moments like People or the USA Today Life section.pic.twitter.com/vXgBvV4gUZ
700721117900570624 2016-02-19 16:38:27 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo yeah it might be the only use case, but it's perfect for that. The quick visual browsing really gives me a sense of the trend.
700719991109226496 2016-02-19 16:33:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> @dtunkelang why? These trends are super-fun/interesting.
700718690522656768 2016-02-19 16:28:49 UTC <MarcBodnick> Moments are starting to grow on me. Best use case - internet & Twitter trends.pic.twitter.com/xwZ17MlICI
700142529778286594 2016-02-17 02:19:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @marcambinder Right, it's ridiculous. There's no way to give law enf a backdoor w/o creating vulnerability exploitable by the Chinese/NK/etc
699996385282666497 2016-02-17 16:38:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> You really have to hit your window in presidential elections. Trump & Rubio: this cycle is perfect. Christie: missed his opening in '12.
699828248390344704 2016-02-16 05:30:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> @shakeshack I work at Quora and we want to invite you to host a Quora session. Can you follow me so I can DM you?
699422766596919296 2016-02-15 02:39:16 UTC <MarcBodnick> @EvaGantz send me a Quora private message?
698655052634783744 2016-02-13 23:48:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> Scalia dying is for Cruz what the San Bernardino shooting was for Trump
697999381488750592 2016-02-11 04:23:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't learn much from CNN's post-debate focus groups
697971231589425152 2016-02-11 02:31:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias hard to say. I don't think so -> I think he was talking about his take-on-the-powerful-interests profile.
697628377360916480 2016-02-10 03:49:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine I'm thinking abt optimizing for new reader, not writer. New user/re-activ user reading exp can be improved, just as FB's was
697626382688342016 2016-02-10 03:41:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @JoshConstine not sure I agree w this. Facebook on-boarding of adults was far from ideal for a while but then they fixed it
697597201501925377 2016-02-10 01:45:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @fmanjoo @nytimes Disagree. Twitter is too good a product to not aim for growth and greatness.
697480077571850245 2016-02-10 17:59:43 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ezraklein the page 404s
697298532416430081 2016-02-09 05:58:19 UTC <MarcBodnick> I get the impression that @donnabrazile is rooting for Hillary.
697294864300396545 2016-02-09 05:43:45 UTC <MarcBodnick> The people of South Carolina are tremendous
696920713802997760 2016-02-08 04:57:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> None of Bernie's supporters care about foreign policy. It's the economy stupid.
696575737915047936 2016-02-07 06:06:12 UTC <MarcBodnick> John McCain and Mitt Romney never looked so good
696507145425068033 2016-02-07 01:33:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> My Twitter is giving Coldplay the Peyton Manning treatment
696500824264957952 2016-02-07 01:08:31 UTC <MarcBodnick> My Twitter is giving Peyton Manning the LinkedIn treatment.
696424886382624768 2016-02-07 20:06:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois Facebook clearly could have gone public sooner
696422399500115972 2016-02-07 19:56:53 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois disagree. Agree all cos shud be pub over time but ST obsess of public invs shud cause some cos 2 stay priv beyond when GS/MS say go
696411994300112896 2016-02-07 19:15:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois I don't see why a great CEO needs near-term public pressure to execute well
696411339091103744 2016-02-07 19:12:56 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois maybe. Doesn't look good for the company to me, unless you think the sunlight was needed to force leadership changes.
696395412945514497 2016-02-07 18:09:39 UTC <MarcBodnick> Public mkt invs don't understand all complex techcos, so it doesn't make sense to IPO until u have story & qtrly path that they'll "get."
696392150813028353 2016-02-07 17:56:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter exp doesn't support go-public-quickly thesis. Going public asap maybe good for invs. But not necessarily for co's focused on LT.
696383831905964032 2016-02-07 17:23:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ywxwy yep but FB is not under appreciated these days
696383486014271489 2016-02-07 17:22:15 UTC <MarcBodnick> If you curate your follower graph, Twitter is incredible. The company has problems, but you need to appreciate this to understand the opp.
696188404464119808 2016-02-06 04:27:04 UTC <MarcBodnick> Ted Cruz was the clear winner tonight -- established depth to nearly every position.
696085633295515648 2016-02-06 21:38:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> @shawnemerriman hey we would love to have you host a Quora session. Follow me back so I can DM you?
695419973582213120 2016-02-04 01:33:36 UTC <MarcBodnick> If Jesus and Moses came back from the dead, women would be harassed on their subreddits
695349380522516481 2016-02-04 20:53:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> I was thinking today that Trump's popularity is a lot like Rush Limbaugh's. Lots of code words.
695106296500989954 2016-02-03 04:47:10 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't support Ted Cruz but I relish his attempt to aggressively dismantle Donald Trump.
695080908219486208 2016-02-03 03:06:17 UTC <MarcBodnick> The Stanford Band has become my favorite trollhttps://twitter.com/deadspin/status/695071222955143168
695056309717041152 2016-02-03 01:28:32 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't see how it's to Hillary's advantage to get drawn into a "who's more progressive" fight w Bernie.
695027329236496385 2016-02-03 23:33:22 UTC <MarcBodnick> @samhouston http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/trump-resists-staff-calls-to-change-course-218711
695027131303141380 2016-02-03 23:32:35 UTC <MarcBodnick> Seems like Trump is simply unwilling to spend the $$ that it takes to win. I'm surprised the media isn't reporting this angle more directly.
694970097228607488 2016-02-03 19:45:57 UTC <MarcBodnick> @relevantorgans @modestproposal1 @realDonaldTrump kidding aside, this isn't coup talk. It's "run as an independent" talk.
694962023424110592 2016-02-03 19:13:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> The "please clap" thing is really telling. It's not that big a deal in and of itself, but jeez that is a terrible soundbite.
694937200941670400 2016-02-03 17:35:14 UTC <MarcBodnick> @mattyglesias eh, Trump insisted in most strident possible way that he was going to win, & cited #1 standing in polls as primary credential
694929344163020800 2016-02-03 17:04:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> I don't support Bernie but I think he's one of the highest integrity candidates, ever. His refusal to get into the dirt is incredible.
694915352879181824 2016-02-03 16:08:25 UTC <MarcBodnick> If you read carefully, feels like beginning of Trump's case for running as an independent if he doesn't get the nomhttps://twitter.com/politico2016/status/694912718713831426
694913358454063104 2016-02-03 16:00:30 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ericries seems like you are in the minority in feeling this way. Her share of young people voting was sub 25% iirc
694898910335086592 2016-02-03 15:03:05 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack seems like a moot point in two different ways
694802895347142656 2016-02-03 08:41:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pmarca am super skeptical of these post college income comparisons
694573421733122048 2016-02-02 17:29:42 UTC <MarcBodnick> Pretty mesmerizing. One of my favorite positive ads.https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/694572597191639041
694407184847769600 2016-02-01 06:29:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @maxrogo Yeah but NH is different.

694388696758419456 2016-02-01 05:15:41 UTC <MarcBodnick> @bradsilverberg oh jeez Nikki Haley looks like the frontrunner to me
694387156526067713 2016-02-01 05:09:33 UTC <MarcBodnick> JB, CC, JK gotta get out & let Rubio consolidate. The moment NH wraps GWB & Mitt should be wheeled out to make them offers they can't refuse
694361849458864128 2016-02-01 03:29:00 UTC <MarcBodnick> @blumenfeld that's it
694358571513843712 2016-02-01 03:15:58 UTC <MarcBodnick> Both my daughters pushing for Sanders and Trump because that creates an opening for Bloomberg. Not kidding.
694357983828914177 2016-02-01 03:13:38 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois yeah crazy. Rubio played expectations pretty amazingly. Other guys gotta go now.
694357675123961856 2016-02-01 03:12:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> That big >20 number for Rubio should be big for him heading into New Hampshire. I thought he'd be at 18ish.
694338800328142848 2016-02-01 01:57:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rabois huh that's smart. Mm, I think being Vice President helped. But yeah the red baiting history seems kinda analogous.
694337654050025472 2016-02-01 01:52:51 UTC <MarcBodnick> @rfradin I'm starting to enjoy Trump's attacks against him
694337093523238912 2016-02-01 01:50:37 UTC <MarcBodnick> If your endgame is to be president, spending a lifetime being super-dislikable seems like a contrarian strategy.

692026661953359873 2016-01-26 16:49:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> Trump is making Fox look journalistically principled and impartialpic.twitter.com/j0i6peZshA
692018604171141120 2016-01-26 16:17:46 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack @MikeIsaac I've thought for a while that G needs viable last mile service to get self-driv cars going - Lyft DoorDash Instacart
692014138864726017 2016-01-26 16:00:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack @fmanjoo @MikeIsaac I've heard Google keeps some cash under the mattress
692013847289303041 2016-01-26 15:58:52 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack @MikeIsaac the only restriction I can imagine is that they'd have to leave the uber board
692013155958919169 2016-01-26 15:56:08 UTC <MarcBodnick> @danprimack @MikeIsaac wouldn't surprise me if Google acquires Lyft
692001883729186816 2016-01-26 15:11:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> @vtripaathi @balajivis @Tatiana_Estevez OK we're aware of the issue & r working on it. Keep letting us know about problems as you see them.
691998321599057920 2016-01-26 14:57:11 UTC <MarcBodnick> @vtripaathi @balajivis we're investigating. cc @Tatiana_Estevez
691824480008667138 2016-01-25 03:26:24 UTC <MarcBodnick> Bloomberg may see himself as anti-spoiler/anti-Nader. If Trump is the R nominee, then B wins (unlikely) or tilts election to HRC (likely).
691649679499460608 2016-01-25 15:51:48 UTC <MarcBodnick> I've been thinking for a while that Cruz has it good with Trump as a foil, but the reverse may be even more true.
691452188896284672 2016-01-24 02:47:03 UTC <MarcBodnick> 1 mistake ppl r making: assuming that Bloomberg is optimizing only for winning. IMO he may savor happy warrior fight/punching Trump in face.
691431710433480704 2016-01-24 01:25:40 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pmarca sure. what you are really saying is that other guys should bow out. Hard to do until post NH. Might as well cash the lottery ticket.
691427109554663424 2016-01-24 01:07:23 UTC <MarcBodnick> @pmarca Rubio alone seems like the best bet.
691348503931400192 2016-01-24 19:55:02 UTC <MarcBodnick> @sean_a_rose IPO was mistake IMO - led to ++ near term focus. But going priv attempt now wud result in M&A proc/strat takeout/loss of indep
691345559957819392 2016-01-24 19:43:20 UTC <MarcBodnick> Twitter seems pretty sturdy to me as an awesome product, regardless of executive turnover.
690072340345024512 2016-01-20 07:24:01 UTC <MarcBodnick> @ksimm the appeal of both is non-reasonable
690071576465768454 2016-01-20 07:20:59 UTC <MarcBodnick> The Bachelor reminds me a lot of Donald Trump.
689705254548467712 2016-01-19 07:05:21 UTC <MarcBodnick> @patrickc talk how you talk
