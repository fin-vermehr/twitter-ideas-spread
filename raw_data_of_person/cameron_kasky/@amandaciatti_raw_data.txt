881218609229557761 2017-07-01 18:31:03 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseCommerce @jarreddjohnson Actually it doesn't. You pay more at the hospital and your office. Yes you're getting 50% off of retail markup- not what they charge ins co
881218257260167168 2017-07-01 18:29:39 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseCommerce @jarreddjohnson But when that emergency happens to you guess we can tell you to go suck it
881218171851722752 2017-07-01 18:29:19 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseCommerce @jarreddjohnson Which won't pay for one trip to ER.  And the rest of us are footing your bill. Or a cancer dx. Or gallbladder surgery. Or a child w/autism
881217345393504257 2017-07-01 18:26:02 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseCommerce @jarreddjohnson As well because hospitals, Drs and care providers charge you more to make up for the difference in uncompensated care.
881217168557449219 2017-07-01 18:25:19 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseCommerce @jarreddjohnson And no matter what, you're already paying for other people's care if you're in any insurance pool and you're paying for uninsured people to

881214895110356992 2017-07-01 18:16:17 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseCommerce @jarreddjohnson By refusing to find them you purposely collapse the fund.  BTW- which the us govt has been ordered to by Fed. Appeal court
881214734938361856 2017-07-01 18:15:39 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseCommerce @jarreddjohnson That's the point of risk corridor $ because they knew in these first years more sick people would sign up and the funds imbalanced.
881201780868222976 2017-07-01 17:24:11 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseCommerce Since R's refuse to fund the legally required risk cooridors, co-ops are collapsing. The is R sabotage of the system, not market failure

881139507470487552 2017-07-01 13:16:44 UTC <amandaciatti> @BenSasse Repeal with no replacement will set 1/5 of the economy into chaos.   Improve, not replace the ACA

874323613201117184 2017-06-12 17:52:48 UTC <amandaciatti> @greg_jenner My sprint & jump spikes are less bulky and stiff than DD's boots. You only have to keep on your toes &you don't train in them
874323017630982144 2017-06-12 17:50:26 UTC <amandaciatti> @greg_jenner I watch my daughter run but her form is terrible. Hard to stomach from T&F parents.   And we can tell her nothing......
874313102258565120 2017-06-12 17:11:02 UTC <amandaciatti> @greg_jenner football boots don't help w/ proper running form& unless you're a track and field kid, no one ever works on proper running form
873871873699917825 2017-06-11 11:57:45 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro best fun bad movie ever!
872201728644579328 2017-06-06 21:21:11 UTC <amandaciatti> @BillKristol @AristotelianMom without Mozart, Late Haydn wouldn't be Haydn either.  Clear difference between Haydn beforexand after Mozart
871728128309301249 2017-06-05 13:59:16 UTC <amandaciatti> @danielleiat @skipbidder according to recent DNA study of British Isles, very little Viking DNA found in the population.  No Vikings there.
871725261070508032 2017-06-05 13:47:52 UTC <amandaciatti> @Stonekettle yes but by that time the power of the crown was significantly eroded.   And they were not so compliant to the kings wishes
871694920146440192 2017-06-05 11:47:18 UTC <amandaciatti> @wmarybeard after the advent of social media, I now believe he was generous in that estimation. (3/3)
871694749249531904 2017-06-05 11:46:38 UTC <amandaciatti> @wmarybeard sitting in grad school, after being around highly educated people for 5+ years, I thought he was mad(2/3)
871694547453173761 2017-06-05 11:45:50 UTC <amandaciatti> @wmarybeard my cognitive psychology professor once said that two- thirds of the population never reach the stage of abstract thinking.  (1)
871212714781282304 2017-06-03 03:51:12 UTC <amandaciatti> @maggieNYT @ABC @ursus_marit on the bright side NSSA got a plus up in DoE budget. Bad news for everyone else  at DoE like basic science
871212376812605442 2017-06-03 03:49:51 UTC <amandaciatti> @maggieNYT @ABC @ursus_marit that comes from the top.  And we're already there......
871209443769405440 2017-06-03 03:38:12 UTC <amandaciatti> @maggieNYT @ABC @ursus_marit they haven't been.  But the day to day scientists who are doing the real work are still there
871207911506268161 2017-06-03 03:32:07 UTC <amandaciatti> @maggieNYT @ABC @ursus_marit though they do want to loosen the ability to tech transfer nuclear technology.

871207617233899521 2017-06-03 03:30:56 UTC <amandaciatti> @maggieNYT @ABC @ursus_marit right now their focus is on eliminating any funding that supports carbon reduction strategies, alt fuels and
871207496198873092 2017-06-03 03:30:28 UTC <amandaciatti> @maggieNYT @ABC @ursus_marit who manage the National Labs, like Oakridge and Argonne.  However, he can starve them out by slashing budgets.
871207317706027009 2017-06-03 03:29:45 UTC <amandaciatti> @maggieNYT @ABC @ursus_marit he can't fire them.  They're technically not employees of the Fed Govt.  They're employees of the contractors
871207094959173632 2017-06-03 03:28:52 UTC <amandaciatti> @maggieNYT @ABC @ursus_marit they're still there. 
871205124009578496 2017-06-03 03:21:02 UTC <amandaciatti> @maggieNYT @ABC @ursus_marit we'll take nothing. Keep him riding around in 3D printed cars and leave the rest to the real scientists

870325647146713088 2017-06-01 17:06:18 UTC <amandaciatti> @20committee kind of like patriot minded Russians taking up arms in the Ukraine?

868882897863921664 2017-05-28 17:33:20 UTC <amandaciatti> @Stonekettle this Trump rhetoric sets the "have little" against "have nothing" so "have almost everything" takes what's left
868567862981603329 2017-05-27 20:41:30 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro this narrative - its fine if I've got mine- is tiring.  We are a country of toddlers.

864191522463502337 2017-05-15 18:51:29 UTC <amandaciatti> @nytimes that is not playing.  That is sad plinking done better than by most drinks at a dive bar
863181048573603840 2017-05-12 23:56:13 UTC <amandaciatti> @RepPeteKing @ASlavitt @PeterRoskam  does the exact same thing as well. Screens questions,no town hallsdeletes comments, blocks constituents
863101711338139649 2017-05-12 18:40:58 UTC <amandaciatti> @realDonaldTrump @LouiseMensch @OpenIntro it's also not far from several military installations
863101381565132804 2017-05-12 18:39:39 UTC <amandaciatti> @realDonaldTrump @LouiseMensch @OpenIntro and Colorado Springs is also the headquarters of conservative focus on the family - James Dobson
863101146575118336 2017-05-12 18:38:43 UTC <amandaciatti> @realDonaldTrump @LouiseMensch @OpenIntro it's near Colorado College - a mid sized university. 
862675771776741376 2017-05-11 14:28:26 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseGOP @RepShimkus your solution- tax cuts for the wealthy and let poor people die
862341274187292678 2017-05-10 16:19:15 UTC <amandaciatti> @Stonekettle I thought the drinking game was we drank only when he said he was "troubled."
862340157059604480 2017-05-10 16:14:49 UTC <amandaciatti> @TeamElmhurst hey U16 TESC Sophia Ciatti is on the JV team which also won their conference.
862327455092285440 2017-05-10 15:24:21 UTC <amandaciatti> @20committee and the mention of real estate shell corporations in the Yates hearings.  Not a coincidence
862318236028870660 2017-05-10 14:47:43 UTC <amandaciatti> @clusterstock @TheDailyEdge those questions in the last hearing about shell corporations were not by coincidence.
862317610075082753 2017-05-10 14:45:13 UTC <amandaciatti> @thehill surprising that a breast cancer survivor doesn't want to interact with Paul Ryan.  I'm shocked shocked I tel you.......
862035601817833473 2017-05-09 20:04:37 UTC <amandaciatti> @jaketapper but is she a Democrat?  She was hired in one Republican administration and has stayed through both.
862035163114614784 2017-05-09 20:02:53 UTC <amandaciatti> @JessicaValenti @NeilKeicher except that it's Management and higher academia is still male dominated.

860877368038232067 2017-05-06 15:22:13 UTC <amandaciatti> @ShannonMoudyTV I think the 21,000 a year who died pre ACA would disagree
860676267250679809 2017-05-05 02:03:07 UTC <amandaciatti> @AEI @Gooms and those health effects of burning coal such as asthma, emphysema and lung cancer.
860676098245488640 2017-05-05 02:02:27 UTC <amandaciatti> @AEI @Gooms without the added indirect costs of environmental cleanup, and healthcare costs directly from mining
860675919698120704 2017-05-05 02:01:44 UTC <amandaciatti> @AEI @Gooms economics 101- the operations of mining are more expensive than all of those workers.
860624160518701056 2017-05-05 22:36:04 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP insurers would go back to childhood injuries to deny care pre ACA.  How soon we forget
860594947313086464 2017-05-05 20:39:59 UTC <amandaciatti> @WSJ @HouseGOP wasn't this about making it less expensive for people?  You just made it more. Anthem just submitted a 20% in VA in response
860474600563646465 2017-05-05 12:41:46 UTC <amandaciatti> @Lucy_Worsley didn't they know that?  I think even here in the US it's pretty common Jane facts
860347579036569602 2017-05-04 04:17:01 UTC <amandaciatti> @JasonKander and I have a child who receives OT through and IEP at school for motor delays.
860347397377019904 2017-05-04 04:16:18 UTC <amandaciatti> @JasonKander diagnosed with myasthenia Gravis & follicular lymphoma within six month of each other. Without ACA we'd be bankrupt.
860217479272046592 2017-05-04 19:40:03 UTC <amandaciatti> @PeterRoskam 21,000 dead each year prior to the ACA because they couldn't afford care. I hope you can rest your Christian conscience tonight
860203801889910788 2017-05-04 18:45:42 UTC <amandaciatti> @petieg everyone needs it at some point
860203758143381504 2017-05-04 18:45:32 UTC <amandaciatti> @petieg you have a choice in whether or not I have a car.  You do not get to pick and choose whether or not you need healthcare.
860203525690806273 2017-05-04 18:44:36 UTC <amandaciatti> @petieg or, to your own alaogy, got hurt ina car accident not of your making, and now have orthopedic or a TBI which now become prexisting
860203329967861760 2017-05-04 18:43:50 UTC <amandaciatti> @petieg tell that to a child born with a heart defect. Or someone with an autoimmune disease.  Or someone who got cancer.
860192658349854720 2017-05-04 18:01:26 UTC <amandaciatti> @MITEcon @Health_Affairs by this afternoon wait time will be irrelevant if no one can afford coverage.
860192419169669121 2017-05-04 18:00:28 UTC <amandaciatti> @AEI more jobs, cleaner energy source, less illness and pollution-  what's not to love?
860159817750630400 2017-05-04 15:50:56 UTC <amandaciatti> @SusanWBrooks @HouseGOP @WSJ 21,000+ died each year pre ACA because they couldn't afford coverage. You want to return to this?
859767639966707712 2017-05-03 13:52:33 UTC <amandaciatti> @JimLangevin @PeterRoskam voting for 2.0 version of ACHA pulls the rug right out from families with children of disabilities. Please vote no
857312819267727366 2017-04-26 19:17:58 UTC <amandaciatti> @PeterRoskam supports the closing of the two National Science Labs that employ people in his district-about a 4,000 job loss in DuPage Co.
857229265594712064 2017-04-26 13:45:58 UTC <amandaciatti> @20committee @DC_Resister_Bee be thankful he did. Do you really want him or his staff trying to write it themselves?
857227334763642880 2017-04-26 13:38:17 UTC <amandaciatti> @Taniel @pcdillard deep seated loyalties to her constituents is her job.  Hope she does it
857226640786673665 2017-04-26 13:35:32 UTC <amandaciatti> @Parleo_ good to know.  And we have our own questionable news organizations this side of the Atlantic.

857218940669505538 2017-04-26 13:04:56 UTC <amandaciatti> @SpeakerRyan except your plan takes it away, targeting those most especially vulnerable- children,those with disabilities and elderly
857218497084051456 2017-04-26 13:03:10 UTC <amandaciatti> @20committee this is just one of many similar incidents.  It would be shocking if it was new
857218326178779136 2017-04-26 13:02:29 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP to be followed by the biggest deficit and biggest recession
856965975211638785 2017-04-25 20:19:44 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro I mean, what could possibly go wrong?

856862832436146177 2017-04-25 13:29:53 UTC <amandaciatti> @timkmak now that's we're selling off our national forests and parks,  it's not a problem. 
856861723415982085 2017-04-25 13:25:29 UTC <amandaciatti> @business @JaredSHopkins is paying for these tests.   And what's Denny Sanford's relationship ( the hospital donor) to this venture
856861564930019330 2017-04-25 13:24:51 UTC <amandaciatti> @business @JaredSHopkins the real question is, how a hospital system in North and South Dakota, which serves a very small population,
856861095478394882 2017-04-25 13:22:59 UTC <amandaciatti> @Stonekettle and yet the current President is marketing Del what's its name on the State Dept website.....
856860825398673413 2017-04-25 13:21:55 UTC <amandaciatti> @CoreyStewartVA I don't recall any monuments in France celebrating the Vichy Government......
856268734822068228 2017-04-23 22:09:09 UTC <amandaciatti> @DrJaninaRamirez she should be happy she doesn't have a Dad who is also a phD engineer.  #mathsalldaylong......

854774937596436480 2017-04-19 19:13:20 UTC <amandaciatti> @cleolinda @DavidEatsViagra @MissPoBeep absolutely.   Early pregnancy isn't so bad as your balance isn't off yet.  But those months after.
852945713831059459 2017-04-14 18:04:39 UTC <amandaciatti> @holland_tom Romeo and Juliet is often required reading in US HS classes. My daughter is a freshman and they're reading it now.
852508963665047552 2017-04-13 13:09:10 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro I think with an ask like that the the appropriate response is screaming  Monty Python like, " Run away, Run away!"

852508187102244868 2017-04-13 13:06:05 UTC <amandaciatti> @Stonekettle it's North Dakota.  The Nazi sympathizer run strong in that area.
851271078315872256 2017-04-09 03:10:15 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro you can't possibly be one of those Ricardian society types?

849446848695873539 2017-04-04 02:21:25 UTC <amandaciatti> @illinoispolicy not a fair comparison.  Lots of different types of nursing with a wide pay scale. And what about OT?
849440490944638977 2017-04-04 01:56:09 UTC <amandaciatti> @ianbremmer I thought Russia was supposed to be the guarantor of no chemical weapons in Syria......
849440059866664964 2017-04-04 01:54:26 UTC <amandaciatti> @ASlavitt so we won't pay for people with mental illness to get care,&then make it easier for them to have guns.  This should turn out well.
849300382501269505 2017-04-04 16:39:25 UTC <amandaciatti> @thehill @wiselike_imsure @JoEdmondson3 allow not slow.
849300339736162310 2017-04-04 16:39:14 UTC <amandaciatti> @thehill @wiselike_imsure @JoEdmondson3 but Trump intervened and would not slow his dismissal
849300267459850241 2017-04-04 16:38:57 UTC <amandaciatti> @thehill @wiselike_imsure @JoEdmondson3 which is why White House lawyers told him to cease.  Then McMaster wanted him gone
849300163659280385 2017-04-04 16:38:32 UTC <amandaciatti> @thehill @wiselike_imsure @JoEdmondson3 purview and may have been potentially illegal as well
849300112002166786 2017-04-04 16:38:20 UTC <amandaciatti> @thehill @wiselike_imsure @JoEdmondson3 he was ordered to stop reviewing unmasking requests as his review of them was outside his own
849299996780503041 2017-04-04 16:37:53 UTC <amandaciatti> @thehill @wiselike_imsure @JoEdmondson3 remember that the info came from the 30 year old that McMaster wanted to have removed.

846510161514647553 2017-03-27 23:52:04 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @HockeyCanada @masa2009t it's also about the lack of dollars that USA Hockey uses to subsidizes boys development
846510046695620608 2017-03-27 23:51:37 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @HockeyCanada @masa2009t to what they proposed- not what they currently get. And this isn't just about training

846506067211309056 2017-03-27 23:35:48 UTC <amandaciatti> @byajperez I have a mid 90's custom catcher that is no longer legal and I've relaxed the pocket several times I understand completely.
846503078882955264 2017-03-27 23:23:55 UTC <amandaciatti> @PureHockey @HockeyGiant_VA @usahockey @byajperez apparently one cannot be trusted in a room full of goalie gear.  #goalieproblems
846481309056847872 2017-03-27 21:57:25 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @J92226 @RealWacoKid since this has been going on for more than 15 months - patience and respect have been long gone.
846470303287033857 2017-03-27 21:13:41 UTC <amandaciatti> @whatthenuggs the girls game either.  So they are only asking for what they earned.
846469988299034626 2017-03-27 21:12:26 UTC <amandaciatti> @whatthenuggs more.  Oh- and the 3 mil in revenue generated by girls/women's membership fees?  That doesn't seem to make it to support
846469830521839616 2017-03-27 21:11:48 UTC <amandaciatti> @whatthenuggs none of these dollars are making it to the girls development or the women.  And by the way, the women by their placement earn
846469678696484865 2017-03-27 21:11:12 UTC <amandaciatti> @whatthenuggs and USA Hockey gets 1.5 million from the US Olympic Committee for both men and women's programs but surprisingly (not)
846469521150005249 2017-03-27 21:10:35 UTC <amandaciatti> @whatthenuggs with over five million earmarked specifically for boys/men's programs according to their 990.
846469408012849153 2017-03-27 21:10:08 UTC <amandaciatti> @whatthenuggs hum no.  That's part of the boycott is more money towards girls development program which gets exactly 15,540 right now.
846447054008279041 2017-03-27 19:41:18 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @SenatorLeahy @billschloer1 is exactly why government gets involved
846447001583734784 2017-03-27 19:41:06 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @SenatorLeahy @billschloer1 when USA Hockey gets a tax exempt status because they are providing s public benefit and then don't

846368947884699650 2017-03-27 14:30:56 UTC <amandaciatti> @brianlawton9 @byajperez @flamingboyant but it's easier to make it about pay when that's only part of the overall issue.
846368831278895104 2017-03-27 14:30:28 UTC <amandaciatti> @brianlawton9 @byajperez @flamingboyant they're also fighting for the lack of funding& support all they way down the line for girls hockey
846216280562712576 2017-03-26 04:24:17 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @ben_scrivens @jasonshaw1988 & payed an organization 600,000 to promote college hockey through its blog/social media.Mostly men's
846216030024355840 2017-03-26 04:23:18 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @ben_scrivens @jasonshaw1988 junior hockey leagues are separate from NDTP.  Last posted 990 USA Hockey subsidized them by 1 mil.
846215745885360130 2017-03-26 04:22:10 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @ben_scrivens @jasonshaw1988 NTDP is subsidized through nonrestricted funds.  The NHL does not restrict that money
846213830485127168 2017-03-26 04:14:33 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @ben_scrivens @jasonshaw1988 by that logic USAH quit subsidizing its junior programs because they don't make money either
846211500238888961 2017-03-26 04:05:18 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @ben_scrivens @jasonshaw1988 hard to grow the game in any meaningful fashion when you work to exclude half the population.
846148252521172992 2017-03-26 23:53:58 UTC <amandaciatti> @HumanistCentury in 2014, they earmarked over 5 million for boys/ men according to their 990, and only 15,540 for girls.
846148126935306240 2017-03-26 23:53:28 UTC <amandaciatti> @HumanistCentury for girls/ women in the entire 2014 990.
846148072069582849 2017-03-26 23:53:15 UTC <amandaciatti> @HumanistCentury out of that 2.7 million granted to local organization only 15,540 are earmarked for women.  The only earmarked dollars
846147828728680448 2017-03-26 23:52:17 UTC <amandaciatti> @HumanistCentury earmarked for boys- mostly junior hockey in addition to the other 472,000 they spend
846147692644458500 2017-03-26 23:51:45 UTC <amandaciatti> @HumanistCentury 2.7 million of that international programs goes back to local organizations.  Nearly 900,000 of that is specifically
846143130151858176 2017-03-26 23:33:37 UTC <amandaciatti> @AshonIce @jollywhiskey excluding half the population isn't a good way to do that
846143056684421121 2017-03-26 23:33:19 UTC <amandaciatti> @AshonIce @jollywhiskey to turn our NHL players an win Olympic gold but rather grow the game.
846142853613064194 2017-03-26 23:32:31 UTC <amandaciatti> @AshonIce @jollywhiskey money given to USA Hockey from its foundation should be serving the mission of the organization which is not
846142658649174017 2017-03-26 23:31:45 UTC <amandaciatti> @AshonIce @jollywhiskey very common with membership organizations to have a foundation arm.  That being said,
846142457821761536 2017-03-26 23:30:57 UTC <amandaciatti> @AshonIce @jollywhiskey it's a 501(c)3 while USA hockey is a non profit, donations to it directly are not  tax deductible.
846142233778798592 2017-03-26 23:30:03 UTC <amandaciatti> @AshonIce @jollywhiskey the Tranter of money through the foundation isn't necessarily shady.  It provides the NHL a tax break because
846140852955164672 2017-03-26 23:24:34 UTC <amandaciatti> @CassieCampbell @FotoSharkz the IIHF.
846139982037356546 2017-03-26 23:21:06 UTC <amandaciatti> @AshonIce @jollywhiskey as unrestricted dollars.  Meaning they claim the money is not specifically for NTDP as people claim.
846139874453413888 2017-03-26 23:20:41 UTC <amandaciatti> @AshonIce @jollywhiskey and the NHL grant is actually given unrestricted to the USA Hockey Foundation and then passed through
846139634040102913 2017-03-26 23:19:43 UTC <amandaciatti> @AshonIce @jollywhiskey 25 mil comes from membership and another 3 mil from tournaments.  NHL  and Olympic committee makes up 9.9 million
846135949964853248 2017-03-26 23:05:05 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @CassieCampbell @FotoSharkz nonprofit organization.  They generate their revenue from membership dues- not games.
846129170371547141 2017-03-26 22:38:09 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @Shadowgbq @RodneyFort of their dollars on.
846129135353298944 2017-03-26 22:38:00 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @Shadowgbq @RodneyFort and funding and creating opportunities for boys to play in the NHL is what they are spending most
846129000644820997 2017-03-26 22:37:28 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @Shadowgbq @RodneyFort for some of them that women have no place in the game.
846128922882400256 2017-03-26 22:37:10 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @Shadowgbq @RodneyFort these are the same men who time and time again have said no to the women.  This is a fundamental belief
846126236342665217 2017-03-26 22:26:29 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @MacTalk_Live @MadPow77 over 400,000 - closer 500,000 with compensation package.
846117032504561664 2017-03-26 21:49:55 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro and most of there funding comes from membership fees and tournaments.  Not the NHL or OLympic Deb Committee
846116810973958147 2017-03-26 21:49:02 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro not insane. Criminal.  And as a former player I thought it couldn't possibly be this bad.  It was worse than I thought.
846116519419502596 2017-03-26 21:47:52 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro &I'm not counting the 600,000 that USAH grants to College Hockey Inc for coverage of college hockey. Coverage is primarily men.
846116235465179137 2017-03-26 21:46:45 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro it doesn't mean there weren't other dollars spent on women, but none could be specifically identified as either gender
846116081194450944 2017-03-26 21:46:08 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro boys/ men's programs I can account for a bit more than 5 mil.  For girls/women's it's 15,540.
846115901959290880 2017-03-26 21:45:25 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro just for a little mathematical excerise I looked at the 990.  Just taking the dollars in their programs, directly allocated to
846115458172510210 2017-03-26 21:43:39 UTC <amandaciatti> @byajperez @MightyD88 no-  everyone gets a juice box and orange slice break!
846114989186465792 2017-03-26 21:41:48 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @RodneyFort the funding discrepancies trickle all the way down.
846114908123152386 2017-03-26 21:41:28 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @RodneyFort I'm not seeing it end well for USA Hockey or their state level affiliates.   My guess is
846114387710693376 2017-03-26 21:39:24 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro @AGMSports disgusting.  Ugh.  Hope those girls say no.
846113969337221120 2017-03-26 21:37:44 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro not even flying.  Email form.   Much easier to face rejection via the internet I guess.
846099035152887809 2017-03-26 20:38:24 UTC <amandaciatti> @RodneyFort @WALLACHLEGAL so zero isn't accurate, it's highly disproportionate.
846098544998174721 2017-03-26 20:36:27 UTC <amandaciatti> @RodneyFort @WALLACHLEGAL that all those dollars are going proportionally to girls/ women's programs
846098452039811072 2017-03-26 20:36:05 UTC <amandaciatti> @RodneyFort @WALLACHLEGAL the caveat is that there are dollars to which the gender that benefits is not known. But it's highly unlikely
846096594298646529 2017-03-26 20:28:42 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey looking at your 2014 990- can you explain why 5 mil in funding earmarked for boys/men's programs and only 15,540 for girls?
846095745505804289 2017-03-26 20:25:20 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @RodneyFort only 15,540 dedicated to girls
846095655504351232 2017-03-26 20:24:58 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @RodneyFort and 862,647 from the 2.7 mil in paid out grants to other organizations.
846095456870567936 2017-03-26 20:24:11 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @RodneyFort 467,213 for Junior programs ( boys only)
846095367661916160 2017-03-26 20:23:49 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @RodneyFort this is the 3,687,838 for NTDP
846095270899302400 2017-03-26 20:23:26 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @RodneyFort so, after adding up what I know are exclusively male only programs vs female only programs is 5,017,698.
846089037156888579 2017-03-26 19:58:40 UTC <amandaciatti> @SueHovey @LuticiaJohnson @byajperez I also have a Masters in Nonprofit Management. I read these for fun.
846088817555771396 2017-03-26 19:57:48 UTC <amandaciatti> @SueHovey @LuticiaJohnson @byajperez but they report to the IRS that only 16 are voting members for financial matters.
846088725562118144 2017-03-26 19:57:26 UTC <amandaciatti> @SueHovey @LuticiaJohnson @byajperez the 990 gives the basis for their governing votes.  They may have a full board of that amount
846088505990299648 2017-03-26 19:56:34 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @RodneyFort 990 is very revealing if you know where to look
846088347462352896 2017-03-26 19:55:56 UTC <amandaciatti> @RodneyFort @WALLACHLEGAL and he hockey camps
846088275043463168 2017-03-26 19:55:38 UTC <amandaciatti> @RodneyFort @WALLACHLEGAL the rest is either an unknown block grant or specifically dedicated to boys/ men's only events like boys camps
846088059766685696 2017-03-26 19:54:47 UTC <amandaciatti> @RodneyFort @WALLACHLEGAL paid out to local organizations heavily skews to  boys.  Less than 20,000 is specifically allocated to girls/women
846087864777687041 2017-03-26 19:54:01 UTC <amandaciatti> @RodneyFort @WALLACHLEGAL female equivalent. Same for dollars for Junior hockey. No female equivalent.  The grant breakdown of the 2.7 mil
846087715359784961 2017-03-26 19:53:25 UTC <amandaciatti> @RodneyFort @WALLACHLEGAL looking at the 990s now.  There's several categories that are exclusively male hockey. NTDP and there is no
846069242877366272 2017-03-26 18:40:01 UTC <amandaciatti> @SueHovey @LuticiaJohnson @byajperez actually only 16 members of the board are voting members according to their 990.
846065194409361409 2017-03-26 18:23:56 UTC <amandaciatti> @minskz35 @byajperez and there is no consequence for local hockey orgs. From the state or national governing bodies.
846065074187984898 2017-03-26 18:23:27 UTC <amandaciatti> @minskz35 @byajperez and let the clubs schedule their teams ice time allocation.  That's where the disparities often happen
846064907833487361 2017-03-26 18:22:47 UTC <amandaciatti> @minskz35 @byajperez the other way around it is you sell your slots to the club itself which may or may not have girls teams and
846064752996634624 2017-03-26 18:22:10 UTC <amandaciatti> @minskz35 @byajperez ahhh. But when do they schedule the girls teams?  Sat at 10 pm blows.  But, hey you get an ice slot.
846060878621499392 2017-03-26 18:06:47 UTC <amandaciatti> @doctalk @byajperez @minskz35 where in the hell do girls receive 1/2 the ice slots?  Not true in Illinois.....
846060467038638080 2017-03-26 18:05:09 UTC <amandaciatti> @SueHovey @LuticiaJohnson @byajperez women alumni on it, though not a majority,  the decision making is almost always driven by a select few
846060301233598465 2017-03-26 18:04:29 UTC <amandaciatti> @SueHovey @LuticiaJohnson @byajperez but an executive committee that gets the decision making authority.   With a board this large and many
846060134233264128 2017-03-26 18:03:49 UTC <amandaciatti> @SueHovey @LuticiaJohnson @byajperez how many are actually voting members for this kind of deal?  A lot of times it's not a full board vote
846059457041895424 2017-03-26 18:01:08 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @byajperez so three players?  Or six for a starting lineup?
846055882416963586 2017-03-26 17:46:55 UTC <amandaciatti> @quinnkuntz Brava, ladies!
846055338310881281 2017-03-26 17:44:46 UTC <amandaciatti> @nytimes @MarySadler19 agreed.  Let him think he's just some guy out glad handing.
846031973445455872 2017-03-26 16:11:55 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @RodneyFort maybe. But in the 2015 990 15,550 is earmarked for girls.  That's it. So out of a 40.1 million budget, its 0
846027837689794560 2017-03-26 15:55:29 UTC <amandaciatti> @Womenshckyinfo @AGMSports what's even sadder is you look at the amount of grants specifically earmarked for girls hockey
845980782170705920 2017-03-26 12:48:30 UTC <amandaciatti> @cyclonesjrcoach teach them standing together may move mountains.  And they rock!!!
845978603003285505 2017-03-26 12:39:51 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL the worst is that USaH has no problem claiming credit women's hockey success but has contributed nothing.
845977826658529280 2017-03-26 12:36:46 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL @ShawnieMac23 when bisthalon can come up with dollars for their athletes with a 2.3 mil budget, I think USAH can do better.
845975030945251329 2017-03-26 12:25:39 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL those dollars are separate from the 3.5 million.
845974897868357632 2017-03-26 12:25:07 UTC <amandaciatti> @WALLACHLEGAL they're also playing this womens world championship in a new ice arena USA hockey built for the men's NDTP's program.
845482354651152384 2017-03-24 03:47:56 UTC <amandaciatti> @unputdownable_1 @alexgreat @christal_ellard if you ask the indigenous community they would say they are.
845479801699913728 2017-03-24 03:37:47 UTC <amandaciatti> @chicagotribune @christal_ellard @unputdownable_1 @alexgreat well if you look at the health&wellbeing stats of Native Americans it qualifies

845322195903623168 2017-03-24 17:11:31 UTC <amandaciatti> @enginedocsteve  I see your funny thread and raise you one.  It's supposed to be about HC negotiations. https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/845311965446725636
844008999423021060 2017-03-20 02:13:21 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 USA Hockey raised over 40 million last year. They have the dollars but choose to allocate it towards boys and men
844008666751799298 2017-03-20 02:12:01 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 @Man_frenjensen not much.
844008600263626756 2017-03-20 02:11:45 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 @Man_frenjensen it's how they spend it.  Looking at the grants in the 990- how much of that goes to girls?
844008452116627457 2017-03-20 02:11:10 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 @Man_frenjensen they spend 1.7 million on fundraising expenses alone.  They have the money.
844008194116669443 2017-03-20 02:10:09 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 @Man_frenjensen they generated 40.1 million in revenue and had s net balance of 3 mil at the end of 2015.
843993471329472513 2017-03-20 01:11:38 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 inequitable ( which is not the same as equal) treatment is not carrying out their mission.
843993281235210240 2017-03-20 01:10:53 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 USA Hockey has a very specific mission. That they legally have to fulfill to maintain their tax exempt status.
843992796876947457 2017-03-20 01:08:58 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 on the money they earn or raise.  For that privilege they have to show they do something for the greater good.
843992517276323840 2017-03-20 01:07:51 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 USA Hockey is not a business. It's an organized nonprofit.  It's why they don't pay taxes
843992299763851270 2017-03-20 01:06:59 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 that's the part you don't understand-curling is a completely separate organization. Oranges and apples.
843986782219882496 2017-03-20 00:45:04 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 with girls and women playing a signifcant part in participation numbers
843986642385997828 2017-03-20 00:44:30 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 the one metric in growth of the sport that would be mission central actually works in favor of the women,
843986455039000577 2017-03-20 00:43:46 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 those metrics are essentially irrelevant to their mission
843986355394936832 2017-03-20 00:43:22 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 interest has no bearing on their legal and ethical obligations.  It's a nonprofit organization.
843984532529405953 2017-03-20 00:36:07 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 in violation of federal laws.
843984366854397952 2017-03-20 00:35:28 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 could put their nonprofit status at risk and if they take federal dollars to support Olympic efforts are actually
843984196494393344 2017-03-20 00:34:47 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 to fulfill their mission, by not even attempting equitable support they literally are not fulfilling their mission
843984021214367744 2017-03-20 00:34:05 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 and their mission is to create opportunities for both men and women.  As they receive grants and fundraise
843983697611243522 2017-03-20 00:32:48 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc @StrykerBrig24 they don't want the same amount, but an equitable amount. 2-  USA Hockey isn't a for profit organization and
843838321222737920 2017-03-20 14:55:08 UTC <amandaciatti> @housebudgetGOP @HouseGOP @USCBO so you'll just past the cost onto states and individuals.  Way to pass the buck and make your friends rich

842845091677048832 2017-03-17 21:08:23 UTC <amandaciatti> @kuklaskorner @ChrisKuc @mrshark444 third, level of support for Olympic quality athletes is abysmal even compared to other sports
842844755990106113 2017-03-17 21:07:03 UTC <amandaciatti> @kuklaskorner @ChrisKuc @mrshark444 is actually in violation of the law
842844713388572672 2017-03-17 21:06:53 UTC <amandaciatti> @kuklaskorner @ChrisKuc @mrshark444 second, by having such disparate rates of support for men and women- who are only asking for equitable,
842844589623050241 2017-03-17 21:06:24 UTC <amandaciatti> @kuklaskorner @ChrisKuc @mrshark444 first, USAxHockey is a nonprofit organization- profit is not their business by their bylaws.
842756446764879872 2017-03-17 15:16:09 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro always can tell it's St.Pats day by the 2pm vomit over the side of the bridge on Michigan Ave by some 20something bro.
842754084964917249 2017-03-17 15:06:46 UTC <amandaciatti> @reason @jaketapper by that reason we should also end DoD spending which is rife with cronyism& corruption in a much larger budget scale
842730375919079425 2017-03-17 13:32:33 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro boot hockey!  Or rather rainboot hockey!
842497139674681344 2017-03-16 22:05:45 UTC <amandaciatti> @chicagotribune @bigreno4 they sponsor nothing in comparison for the girls. That's the point
842452469191999489 2017-03-16 19:08:15 UTC <amandaciatti> @chicagotribune @dsullivan26 no olympian in any sport plays for just love. All receive stipends 4 training.  This one is low across sports.
842452164752596993 2017-03-16 19:07:02 UTC <amandaciatti> @chicagotribune @bigreno4 and USA hockey does not pay for any developmental leagues or programs for the girls.  NTDP, USHL all get support.
842434820353462273 2017-03-16 17:58:07 UTC <amandaciatti> @ChrisKuc interesting way @usa hockey is defining commitment to dialogue.  Sounds like my way or else
842433060163469312 2017-03-16 17:51:07 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey @tortellini_13 @KevinHussey4 us hockey said they could in the future earn. Players lawyers says this offer is new to them
842379953467449344 2017-03-16 14:20:06 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey women continue to participate despite your lackluster support and efforts.  Sad that you can't support them back
842379745937485824 2017-03-16 14:19:16 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey and decades of commitment is laughable- remember trying to block girls in MN from ice time or forcing ringette instead of hockey?
842379444715175937 2017-03-16 14:18:04 UTC <amandaciatti> @usahockey don't forget the amazing growth your sport experienced in the last decade was due to girls participating.
842037056494788609 2017-03-15 15:37:33 UTC <amandaciatti> @thehill so "secret warrant" is the new phrase for drunk tweeting?

841434392589422592 2017-03-13 23:42:46 UTC <amandaciatti> @usnews @SpeakerRyan @leonardkl that's the same cost as the 10 of the new fighter jets....
841393871510736898 2017-03-13 21:01:45 UTC <amandaciatti> I would say yes.....
841393714866081796 2017-03-13 21:01:08 UTC <amandaciatti> @WSJhealth @stefaniei the revenue lost will outstrip any gains through this
841393383490895873 2017-03-13 20:59:49 UTC <amandaciatti> @stefaniei @WSJhealth @WSJ and then when the ACHA tanks 1/5 of our economic sector)you know the one lost responsible for our growth(1)
841392933324623878 2017-03-13 20:58:02 UTC <amandaciatti> @SpeakerRyan @DennisPerkins5 not doing the job it was intended to do.  Just biohazard then.
841391548738764802 2017-03-13 20:52:32 UTC <amandaciatti> @SpeakerRyan @DennisPerkins5 ear wax actually helps prevent infections.Be thankful -you won't be able see Dr if you get one.
841391126150029312 2017-03-13 20:50:51 UTC <amandaciatti> @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP uhmmmm you apparently didn't read what happens to those 64 and older. 
841390674691915777 2017-03-13 20:49:03 UTC <amandaciatti> @chicagotribune @fltcui58 14 million immoderately; 20 million by 2026
841311726230491137 2017-03-13 15:35:21 UTC <amandaciatti> @oppstn @JordanUhl @PressSec @jpdailing so it doesn't get much discussion- &some of the initiatives not funded by Rep. house
841311451713327104 2017-03-13 15:34:15 UTC <amandaciatti> @oppstn @JordanUhl @PressSec @jpdailing there was stuff in the ACA at the provider level- But it's technical in the weeds stuff
841256075433250816 2017-03-13 11:54:12 UTC <amandaciatti> @TheC20 religious right is steady on board with that.   Not much difference.
841138232456798208 2017-03-12 04:05:56 UTC <amandaciatti> we are not Japan. And Wilders isn't the Netherlands either.
841129174676848640 2017-03-12 03:29:57 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro antenna- Netflix,Hulu and Amazon that I stream through my DVD player. Had Direct TV-  now going on six years and don't miss it
840542493221498880 2017-03-11 12:38:41 UTC <amandaciatti> @Stonekettle yup- that's my home state.  And people are flabbergasted that people with college degrees are leaving.....
840542137913626627 2017-03-11 12:37:16 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro the mom crawling on the floor to close the door was the final straw. The look of sheer panic on her face-  we've all been there

839834350933979136 2017-03-09 13:44:47 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseGOP closing 1/4 hospitals in Ohio, tanking 20% of the economy HC represents, and uninsuring millions.  Well done, you!
839144790180626432 2017-03-07 16:04:43 UTC <amandaciatti> @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SecPriceMD doesn't cover everyone tax breaks for the wealthy, and pass on costs to the state governments.
838186942164512773 2017-03-04 00:38:34 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @VP where was your outrage when you & Trump actively encouraged  WL to publish emails of privates citizens, high school students,etc?
837835398382514176 2017-03-03 01:21:39 UTC <amandaciatti> @FoxNews and none lies under oath or tried to hide the meeting.  False equivalence

836307726682718208 2017-02-27 20:11:14 UTC <amandaciatti> @sangerkatz how about lives saved due to access?  We know that previous a minimum of 21,000 people died each year due to lack of access.
835634353044602881 2017-02-25 23:35:29 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro if I didn't think it was a good place for my daughter before, I sure as hell wouldn't let her play for that woman.
835513027617255424 2017-02-25 15:33:23 UTC <amandaciatti> @tomcolicchio @emmi08 great! Then let's have livable wages based on a one family earner. Now 15/hr should be 30/hr.Glad you're on board!
835495478414487552 2017-02-25 14:23:39 UTC <amandaciatti> @HouseGOP a small subsidy and allow insurers to return to pre ACA plans where you paid a lot and really got nothing= 70m uninsured
834756856555900928 2017-02-23 13:28:38 UTC <amandaciatti> @VP by providing free preventative check ups the ACA did promote individual, proactive responsible health behavior.
834552906229641217 2017-02-22 23:58:12 UTC <amandaciatti> @TheAtlantic the tipi poles were frozen into the ground. They ceremonially burned which they could not remove.

833436150664675328 2017-02-19 22:00:37 UTC <amandaciatti> @iainmartin1 @wpjenna @GigaLiving enjoy your propoganda. Those of us who visit and off and on work there know differently.
833435798859034628 2017-02-19 21:59:13 UTC <amandaciatti> not happening.  And you know that if you anything about the areas you circled. But continue on.
833435375930580992 2017-02-19 21:57:32 UTC <amandaciatti> @AmyMek this isn't happening.

833364425356746752 2017-02-19 17:15:36 UTC <amandaciatti> @Stonekettle the minute he offers a strong alternate opinion than Trump he's out.  Maybe for now keeping his head down is the best
833106646167482369 2017-02-18 00:11:17 UTC <amandaciatti> @Stonekettle does he even know what that means?
832634579332763648 2017-02-17 16:55:27 UTC <amandaciatti> @Stonekettle @ranfran77 already confirmed I believe by DHS

831169842535358465 2017-02-13 15:55:07 UTC <amandaciatti> @illinoispolicy how many of these jobs are typical post holiday layoffs, since most were in the retail and food industry sector?

830132337828646912 2017-02-10 19:12:27 UTC <amandaciatti> @mj_lee @bayofarizona @BenKnappDC so we should discard a policy  and abandon at minimum 40% of the people who gain some benefit?
830131849913581568 2017-02-10 19:10:30 UTC <amandaciatti> @mj_lee @bayofarizona @BenKnappDC aside from the fact that you can get a subsidy- you represent only 2-4% of the insurance market.
830130293914886144 2017-02-10 19:04:19 UTC <amandaciatti> @VixenGoBrach @YourAnonNews and that was written in sarcasm font

824671026172874753 2017-01-26 17:31:08 UTC <amandaciatti> @PeterRoskam but losing over 3509 jobs in Western suburbs is just fine. That's what will happen when you shut down Argonne and Fermi

824419585856249862 2017-01-25 00:52:00 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ UK is a possibility.  Strangely Brexit makes the opportunity possible
824418803056517120 2017-01-25 00:48:54 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ so do I.  We aren't going to be here much longer.  We will be going to Europe. We're not the only ones.
824417688839716864 2017-01-25 00:44:28 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ there will be no one to replace them.  The ones generationally in between will be in Europe, China or India
824417511324127232 2017-01-25 00:43:46 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ it will effect generations of American Universities especially since many Bsby boomers are retiring.
824417262190948352 2017-01-25 00:42:46 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ Americans will not only lose these scientists, but they train future professors and scientists at the labs.
824417129093013505 2017-01-25 00:42:15 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ essentially no research will get done.  Can't hire staff, can't buy equipment, can't travel
824416992614633473 2017-01-25 00:41:42 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ and that's from essentially no increase in funding for 10 plus years do to sequestration.
824416831540695041 2017-01-25 00:41:04 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ nope.  They've had that info for a couple of weeks.   It's in the proposed budget from the House.
824414767095939073 2017-01-25 00:32:52 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ it's quite clear what the policy is.  They've already had a 25% budget reduction.

824412492743004160 2017-01-25 00:23:49 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ they have specifically targeted agencies and research offices that deal with climate change directly or
824409119654285312 2017-01-25 00:10:25 UTC <amandaciatti> @AP @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ I would say that from experience this didn't happen the last two admins.  spouse is a researcher at a Natl Lab

824365354499588099 2017-01-25 21:16:31 UTC <amandaciatti> @amandaciatti yet Disney Magnet and other selective enrollment schools are well equipped. Nothing comparable on the South side

824364866030944263 2017-01-25 21:14:34 UTC <amandaciatti> @_casey__jones_ they wanted to close that many.  Enrollment is down.  But they just opened up Northwestern Academy this week. Not south side
824353871699070980 2017-01-25 20:30:53 UTC <amandaciatti> @_casey__jones_ address school inequity-quit building shiny new schools on the North side and take care of the South Side.
824353547319988239 2017-01-25 20:29:36 UTC <amandaciatti> @_casey__jones_ Beef up FBI and ATF offices. These are the way to get the guns off the streets
824353431926296581 2017-01-25 20:29:08 UTC <amandaciatti> @_casey__jones_ I think we do agree.  But first if the Feds want to help better fund the Federal Court and hire more prosecutors
824352185370759175 2017-01-25 20:24:11 UTC <amandaciatti> @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ using RICO to prosecute higher ups was successful but they kept the lower level guys more in line. Now Wild West
824351959020949510 2017-01-25 20:23:17 UTC <amandaciatti> @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ without it everything is concentrated.  Which means you have a mixing of gang factions in a much smaller area.
824351545122766848 2017-01-25 20:21:38 UTC <amandaciatti> @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ and that's been per of the problem as well.  Gentrification does not include mixed income housing.
824351407147012102 2017-01-25 20:21:05 UTC <amandaciatti> @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ except when they have it has turned the neighborhood around.
824348605532241920 2017-01-25 20:09:57 UTC <amandaciatti> @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ all the National Guard presence will do is escalate things.  And create more animosity and mistrust.
824348361914535941 2017-01-25 20:08:59 UTC <amandaciatti> @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ no serious sustained effort to address the root problem in those neighborhoods.
824348141772296200 2017-01-25 20:08:07 UTC <amandaciatti> @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ and hyper police presence which was the previous strategy didn't work either
824342338419957760 2017-01-25 19:45:03 UTC <amandaciatti> @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ due to prosecuting low level drug offenders as felons and now they can't find jobs.
824342193833963520 2017-01-25 19:44:29 UTC <amandaciatti> @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ has more to do with public housing losses prosecution strategies, hyper local gangs&no employment. (1)
824341153055174656 2017-01-25 19:40:21 UTC <amandaciatti> @arthurbrooks @HouseGOP how about quit hiding from your constituents.  Quit being puppets for business interests an represent your districts
824333549717295104 2017-01-25 19:10:08 UTC <amandaciatti> @ddale8 @_casey__jones_ it's not a mess it's limited to a few neighborhoods.  It's not great but it's been far worse.

822124190572703744 2017-01-19 16:50:56 UTC <amandaciatti> @ASlavitt @nurseintime yes- and removing access to care by eliminating payment mechanisms(I.e ACA) we will drive up that cost systemwide.
822118699066855425 2017-01-19 16:29:06 UTC <amandaciatti> @JasonMillerinDC Christ on cracker- people are mad because she simply is inherently unqualified for the position.

822088498060677120 2017-01-19 14:29:06 UTC <amandaciatti> @ASlavitt you mean  I pay 100 times more for healthcare and never receive care for the condition that qualifies me for one?
822088040059457540 2017-01-19 14:27:17 UTC <amandaciatti> @ASlavitt @nurseintime no matter what model- we subsidize the care of those who have less.
822087745795424260 2017-01-19 14:26:06 UTC <amandaciatti> @ASlavitt @nurseintime hospitals then recover costs from paying customers- i.e. Insurance companies who raise their premiums.
822087542791172098 2017-01-19 14:25:18 UTC <amandaciatti> @ASlavitt @nurseintime people then seek care on an emergency room basis.  Much more expensive and often unrecoverable costs for hospitals(1)
821935109758656512 2017-01-18 04:19:35 UTC <amandaciatti> @Slate warmer winters means more bugs.  Yuck!
821810580042424320 2017-01-18 20:04:45 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 there are other issues with access besides payment. ACA primarily addresses funding.
821810385909141506 2017-01-18 20:03:59 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 rates actually got better for states who accepted the expanded Medicaid option.
821810244602957825 2017-01-18 20:03:25 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 before not b3
821809983595614208 2017-01-18 20:02:23 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 that was a problem long before the ACA.  Not ACA's fault.  Poor reimbursement rates set by Fed b3 ACA
821806939600461826 2017-01-18 19:50:17 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 nationally.  And what state are you in?
821806378994040833 2017-01-18 19:48:03 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 actually in plan ratings Medicaid gets a higher satisfaction rating than most private plans.
821805005955039235 2017-01-18 19:42:36 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 but before was worse and the no solution presented is worse
821804914988949508 2017-01-18 19:42:14 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 so unclear if you're thinking I either don't understand or have empathy-  ACA isn't perfect

821801150345334785 2017-01-18 19:27:17 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 those were Republican requirements.  Risk coirdiors, indiv mandates were all from those discussions
821801029230612480 2017-01-18 19:26:48 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 design was more about Republicans wanting industry protected and indiv. Having some "skin in the game"
821800823726415873 2017-01-18 19:25:59 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 sat in more meetings than I could count pre ACA with officials re: healthcare.  Very aware that ACA
821800366367002624 2017-01-18 19:24:10 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 yes because Rep wanted the private industry. Obama wanted only the public option ( Medicaid expansion)
821799876992389125 2017-01-18 19:22:13 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 but not without their input in designing ACA.  Rep. downvoted their program-party over solutions.
821796479903944704 2017-01-18 19:08:43 UTC <amandaciatti> @tomcolicchio @JustSchmeltzer she's not smart enough to even be a dilletente.  Overwrought PTA mom who hates poor kids and family though....
821796064407785472 2017-01-18 19:07:04 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 so the Risk cooridor was added
821795879401222144 2017-01-18 19:06:20 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 original only had a public option and Republican Party insisted the Ins. industry have a protected role

821795527343898624 2017-01-18 19:04:56 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 actually it was provisioned that the first three years they might.  Hence the risk corridors
821791788902088706 2017-01-18 18:50:05 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 so very related.  Republicans did everything they could to kill the ACA by death of 1000 paper cuts
821791614544867328 2017-01-18 18:49:23 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 &removing the individual mandate will essentially kill all individual policies.Happened in WA mid 90s.
821791318888288256 2017-01-18 18:48:13 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 which is why the rate increase was much lower in Medicaid expanded states
821791217537220608 2017-01-18 18:47:49 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 and insurance companies made up the difference with direct to consumers
821791131994361856 2017-01-18 18:47:28 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 same in states where Medicaid wasn't expanded.  Hospitals got less,
821790988729516033 2017-01-18 18:46:54 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 republican congress refused to provide ins. Comp their subsidies for carrying high risk populations
821790676153204742 2017-01-18 18:45:39 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 actually it's very much related
821774037877719047 2017-01-18 17:39:33 UTC <amandaciatti> @SteveScalise @JulieDiCaro @emoji911 ask you Republican representatives why they gutted the risk corridors?  This increased premiums-
821773241807208450 2017-01-18 17:36:23 UTC <amandaciatti> @thpmurphy @AP when most Americans can't afford an emergency bill of $500, how many do you think will be able to lay into an HSA?

785200000405864448 2016-10-09 19:27:23 UTC <amandaciatti> @YourAnonNews @edmonten and was a political concept supported by almost no one in 14th cent. Ital. penninsula.
784559088806006784 2016-10-07 01:00:37 UTC <amandaciatti> @juliakmarsh trouble is he always means exactly what he says.  He just never understands why its inappropriate.
784531917010001920 2016-10-07 23:12:39 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro @DianaMoskovitz @BossHook if her attorney is amy good, at least.  Not sure about that one though. 2/2
784531727914008576 2016-10-07 23:11:54 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro @DianaMoskovitz @BossHook understand.  Seems easy to reframe for plaintiff though and dangerous tactic for defense1/2
784524576512442368 2016-10-07 22:43:29 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro @DianaMoskovitz @BossHook def soliciting testimony she was drunk seems to prove her point.
784523959228305408 2016-10-07 22:41:02 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro @DianaMoskovitz @BossHook voluntarily ingesting alcohol does not waive consent. 1/2
784512308215177216 2016-10-07 21:54:44 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro @DianaMoskovitz @BossHook if that's the case, then soliciting testimony of her being unconscious supports inability to consent
784512080569335808 2016-10-07 21:53:50 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro @DianaMoskovitz @BossHook isn't a toxicologist on DR list going to essentially testify she was not drugged but very drunk?1/2
784501565197578240 2016-10-07 21:12:03 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro @DianaMoskovitz @BossHook then hasn't the defense just made her case about not being able to give consent?
784501293788307457 2016-10-07 21:10:58 UTC <amandaciatti> @JulieDiCaro @DianaMoskovitz @BossHook isn't consent the key issue?  If they establish she was so intoxicated she can't remember clearly1/2
784491987269365760 2016-10-07 20:33:59 UTC <amandaciatti> @DianaMoskovitz @JulieDiCaro lack of memory due to intoxication? Then how was she able to give consent? Confusing line of reasoning.

781290208318791680 2016-09-28 00:31:15 UTC <amandaciatti> @haroldpollack @mitchellvii willful ignorance.   If I believe in it, it makes it so.  Like the tooth fairy.

775814975688351744 2016-09-13 21:54:38 UTC <amandaciatti> @dmedin11 if it were unfounded then explain why they moved it from N of Bismark ( white predom.) due to water concerns to N of the ST. RK?
