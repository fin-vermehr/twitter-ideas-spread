968879641791516678 2018-02-28 16:04:42 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess This is literally just false. http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a272176.pdf A two second google search and you could know that. February 25, 1992 DoD directive

967871985937207301 2018-02-25 21:20:38 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @brandongroeny Very effective countermeasures ! Only 26 dead instead of millions !
967826739123621889 2018-02-25 18:20:50 UTC <MertyMadness> @mike_gaboury Clearly a render
967567488283217920 2018-02-24 01:10:40 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ There were 26 fatalities from gun related crimes in England and wales 2015-2016. Police fired their weapons 7 times in total that year. If you want to correct for population since the US has 5x the population, they had 130 deaths. Compared to 11,004 in the US. 0 school shootings
967555831691644928 2018-02-24 00:24:21 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ You think people are being ran over and exploded at the same rate as being shot in america?
967527428443791360 2018-02-24 22:31:29 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ Right so its easier to murder more people quickly with guns and should take steps to prevent it like other countries.
967492480441749504 2018-02-24 20:12:37 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ How is that mutually exclusive to knives?
967482173807874048 2018-02-24 19:31:39 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ Do you think 20 injured is somehow similar to 17 dead? Which is worse? Do you think it is easy to commit mass murder with a knife?
967474033791991808 2018-02-24 18:59:19 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ They do make it easier. That's why you don't see 17 people being killed singlehandedly by knives. The murder rate isn't 1:1 with the number of guns and its silly to think it would be.
967282452799647744 2018-02-23 06:18:02 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ No.
967204434102145029 2018-02-23 01:08:01 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ Our murder rate is absolutely higher. Since you referenced Australia, our homicide rate is 5 times higher. Australia also saw a dip in their murder rate. Also there're "only" about 270 to 310 million firearms.
967199013371109376 2018-02-23 00:46:29 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ There isn't another developed country with as many guns nor as lax gun laws. That's the only thing seperating the US.
967153663406952448 2018-02-23 21:46:16 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ Do you believe texting drivers are slamming into school groups at a higher rate than shootings? The core issue is that the only developed nation where this regularly happens is America. Driving and guns are total non-sequiters
967122200670232578 2018-02-23 19:41:15 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess @701SKUHLsoyoAKQ Going to a target range is an assumed risk of operation. Going to school should not be an assumed risk of mass murder, especially when there's only 1 developed nation on Earth where this occurs regularly.
967119418093338625 2018-02-23 19:30:12 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess Damn and had to go back 4 years to find it. So not a recent event nor one even remotely close to as devastating.
967116613773381632 2018-02-23 19:19:03 UTC <MertyMadness> @lexiebess 22 injured vs 17 dead 14 injured. Very similar events!

926568521886326784 2017-11-03 21:55:25 UTC <MertyMadness> @devongiehl Vanilla WoW 3rd party servers have been very popular for years. This argument has been dead for just as long.
926568057476087808 2017-11-03 21:53:34 UTC <MertyMadness> People are STILL saying "vanilla won't be like you remember" despite the massive interest in legacy servers.

885542133674987520 2017-07-13 16:51:11 UTC <MertyMadness> When your subreddit is entirely composed of gifs, we're supposed to think they want to tune in based on love of the game?
885540871504093185 2017-07-13 16:46:10 UTC <MertyMadness> Compound that with a community that barely even cares about esports in the first place.
885540404682215425 2017-07-13 16:44:19 UTC <MertyMadness> Blizzard having no region locking for #OWL seems like a huge risk. People that watch esports for the level of play seem like a niche market.
885532353296257024 2017-07-13 16:12:20 UTC <MertyMadness> @HeroesEsports @ESVDiamond Hey it worked out for WCS America. Who needs viewers when you have high level play?
885151093763735557 2017-07-12 14:57:20 UTC <MertyMadness> Blizzard sure has put a lot of effort into a game that has a playerbase completely disinterested in esports.

713196700270247937 2016-03-24 02:51:58 UTC <MertyMadness> @Xintrael @TeamTespa @BlizzHeroes While also making the process wide open to get around. Competitive integrity should trump "transparency"
713158488738906112 2016-03-24 00:20:08 UTC <MertyMadness> @Xintrael @TeamTespa @BlizzHeroes Revealing the methods behind discovering this would only lead to people seeking ways to get around it
