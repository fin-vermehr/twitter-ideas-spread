860948954783117312 2017-05-06 20:06:41 UTC <lemaxdub> @AdamParkhomenko I know there are more important issues at hand, but how many of those comments do you suppose say "why do you spell your name like that?!?"
860609428508348420 2017-05-05 21:37:31 UTC <lemaxdub> @JoshMalina You were right. They actually call them Bravolebrities now. I guess they were tired of having to say "but we ARE celebrities!"
