961636662416560128 2018-02-08 16:23:41 UTC <tonyzammikiel> @alliemackay Im here bud, in the middle of the 93065. but why are you trying to be at the forefront of the pats demise? They lost by 8! They were a play or two away from 6.
961635213766897664 2018-02-08 16:17:55 UTC <tonyzammikiel> @alliemackay Ive liked you cause were kids from Boston parents that grew up in Ventura county.
961634243372711936 2018-02-08 16:14:04 UTC <tonyzammikiel> @alliemackay What did you JUST do?
961061135460941825 2018-02-06 02:16:45 UTC <tonyzammikiel> @alliemackay Im more optimistic, but at any rate its been a fun 18 years!
961059589729878017 2018-02-06 02:10:36 UTC <tonyzammikiel> @alliemackay yeah, but I think you said it on the radio yesterday, us pats fans have had it so good for so long that we always expect to be there. sooner or later this ride was gonna end. think lakers/49'rs from the 80's, bulls/cowbowys from the 90's, etc. etc. I'd be happy with 1 more SB!
961056895342555136 2018-02-06 01:59:54 UTC <tonyzammikiel> @alliemackay we're really competitive for another year or two. plus Josh gets the HC job there when Bill/Tom are done.

955135923859030016 2018-01-21 17:52:04 UTC <tonyzammikiel> @NYorNothing I remember when I was a little kid, and you could disagree with your friends, and the next day you still all went to the park to play baseball.
955133835863146497 2018-01-21 17:43:46 UTC <tonyzammikiel> @NYorNothing And the difference between me and most others on the Internet, Im not trying to impose my view. I just said I disagree.
