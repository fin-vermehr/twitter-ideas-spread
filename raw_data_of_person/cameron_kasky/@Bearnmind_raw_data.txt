971414454922604544 2018-03-07 15:57:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoeNBC Hard to find any gratitude in my heart for a man who couldnt find his principles in the face of racism, stayed on to ensure tax cuts for himself and the wealthy and only resigned when he couldnt stop @realDonaldTrump idiotic tariffs.

953997888006377473 2018-01-18 14:29:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan are useless. Congress works only for themselves and their donors. #VoteThemOut #Midterms2018http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/politicians-trump-s-town

947881906909138944 2018-01-01 17:27:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateGOP have demonstrated with their lack of response to Puerto Rico that not all American lives matter. #disgraceful #HelpPuertoRico

943166981276160000 2017-12-19 17:11:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @PressSec I know, right?  He assaults women, encourages racism and xenophobia, divides the country, lies and colludes with Russia. Oh and he also hires a soulless liar for a Press Secretary
942820202466762752 2017-12-18 18:13:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @taxfoundation @daveweigel @sahilkapur Remember when @gop @HouseGOP @SenateGOP whined about the natldebt and the debt ceiling when Obama was in office?  Theyre saddling us & our kids with massive debt to pay themselves, Trump and their donors. Does anyone think this bill would pass if they had to pay more under it?
942819271364706304 2017-12-18 18:10:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @OrrinHatch @JakeSherman Hes so disgusted that they were found out. Not disgusted by the fact they put it in, not disgusted enough not to take advantage of it or demand it be taken out. Cornyn said they needed it to get votes, so clearly Senators wouldnt vote for the bill unless it made them richer.
942817911437168642 2017-12-18 18:04:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenThadCochran @RogerWicker are throwing Mississippians under the bus yet again with the hugely unpopular tax bill. Their Senate careers can be summed up by the words in effectual and yes men. They are worthless
942817498214387713 2017-12-18 18:03:02 UTC <Bearnmind> Used to be @HouseGOP @SenateGOP were fiscal conservatives. Yet theyre willing to explode the natl debt, enrich themselves (@SenBobCorker) and their donors and screw the taxpayers. Ill be voting in every election to vote out every Republican who votes for this bill
942816841390612482 2017-12-18 18:00:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenBobCorker @LOLGOP @Lawrence Remember when Republican Senators actually served the people? Yeah me neither. They stay in the Senate for decades with no new ideas and become more corrupt every year. They only thing they care about are donors, themselves & re-election. Ive never been so disillusioned.
942816370940694538 2017-12-18 17:58:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenBobCorker @LOLGOP @Lawrence Hell vote yes. No Republican Senator gives a crap about who this bill hurts as long as it isnt themselves or their donors. Most analysts say well end up paying more taxes as the years go by. This bill is massively unpopular with the American people
942812664761372678 2017-12-18 17:43:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @OrrinHatch @JakeSherman Hes disgusted they were found out. Congress quit serving the people years ago. They serve corporations, donors and themselves

935930793834303488 2017-11-29 17:57:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Soon the America people will terminate your employment.
935930674191765505 2017-11-29 17:57:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump 20 women have accused you. You should be fired.

935928468570886144 2017-11-29 17:48:30 UTC <Bearnmind> Disappointed that @lisamurkowski and @SenSusanCollins are going to take away healthcare from people to satisfy their donors. I expected better from them.
935927976075636739 2017-11-29 17:46:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP main goals are hurting as many people as possible & keeping their donors happy so they can be reelected to hurt more people #VoteThemAllOuthttps://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/935927111956692996
935864882527916032 2017-11-29 13:35:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics In one of the poorer ranked states what does it say about @SenThadCochran and @RogerWicker that they support this?  When did they stop serving the people of MS?
935206529111904256 2017-11-27 17:59:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP can you tell us when you quit caring about the people you serve? Was it when you cashed that big donors check for the 1st time. You are useless #VoteThemOuthttps://twitter.com/indivisibleteam/status/935121186882838529
935205365083492358 2017-11-27 17:55:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN There is no bottom for the @GOP

934153185098371073 2017-11-24 20:14:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @politico Not sure why that matters. Half think Trump should and look how much that matters
933141168946319360 2017-11-21 01:12:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @AC360 @JohnBerman @brianstelter So basically @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is endorsing pedophilia
933027606567555074 2017-11-21 17:41:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @Saints @NFLTotalAccess Drew Brees - No 1
933027068992020480 2017-11-21 17:39:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @KarenAttiah Men seemed so shocked that this is going on. I experienced in and out of work and I dont know any woman who hasnt
933026437505994752 2017-11-21 17:36:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @stuartpstevens The difference between a good, moral man and an immoral asshole
932623897756864513 2017-11-20 14:57:19 UTC <Bearnmind> Oddly enough it seems that @SenThadCochran and @RogerWicker are going to vote for MS citizens to pay higher taxes to give tax breaks to the rich. What a shock. #VoteThemAllOut
932623242858287104 2017-11-20 14:54:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @NewDay Terrifying
932622697368051712 2017-11-20 14:52:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @TheRickWilson @KellyannePolls already sold any integrity or morals she had. Guess her soul is a small price to pay. Shes basically saying pedophilia is ok as long as its a Republican.
932622303074115585 2017-11-20 14:50:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @TwitterSupport @slpng_giants I did
932275360741429248 2017-11-19 15:52:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @bamabeckygirl Look if you want to vote for a pedophile thats your business. I just dont have time for you right now
932255155457810433 2017-11-19 14:32:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @bamabeckygirl Appreciate that. But Im from Alabama.
932102966391255041 2017-11-18 04:27:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP I cannot comprehend the way they are trying to rationalize pedophilia
932102489511514112 2017-11-18 04:25:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @bamabeckygirl Approval isnt the same as perception
932040230118584321 2017-11-18 00:18:01 UTC <Bearnmind> Electing Roy Moore will permanently stain the state of Alabama and solidify every stereotype out there about the state.
932039602163945473 2017-11-18 00:15:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @GovernorKayIvey it says a lot about who you are that youd vote for a pedophile to keep a Democrat from winning. You need to take a hard look in the mirror.  #notfitforoffice
931567834529923072 2017-11-17 17:00:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOPSenFinance @senorrinhatch @SenJohnMcCain And are you peachy keen with healthcare premiums going up 10% a year with removal of the individual mandate?  When did you guys start working only for your donors & corporations

930982081949327360 2017-11-15 02:13:19 UTC <Bearnmind> If a pastor or preacher makes a political endorsement, their church should lose their tax exempt status
930981459153780736 2017-11-15 02:10:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @RosieGray @seanhannity is a joke. He believes Clintons accusers, maybe Moores accusers but not Trumps accusers.
930981158405509121 2017-11-15 02:09:39 UTC <Bearnmind> Has @SenateMajLdr explained why he believes Moores accusers and Clintons accusers but not Trumps? Even with the Access Hollywood tape?
930975004925267974 2017-11-15 01:45:12 UTC <Bearnmind> I absolutely believe that the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP deliberately divide this country so we wont focus on the horrible job theyre doing. #VoteThemOut
930968264305446913 2017-11-15 01:18:25 UTC <Bearnmind> I cannot believe that weve come to a point when voters are faced with a choice between a pedophile and a Democrat & the outcome is uncertain.  What has happened to us?
930951461936214017 2017-11-15 00:11:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @RogerWicker @SenThadCochran why are you willing to use the tax bill to take healthcare away from the people you serve in order to fund tax breaks for the rich? Vote NO
930927059609714689 2017-11-15 22:34:41 UTC <Bearnmind> Once again the @SenateGOP are trying to take healthcare away from millions & pay for tax breaks for the rich on backs of middle class
930902914830426117 2017-11-15 20:58:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNPolitics @gelles The @POTUS @realDonaldTrump as classless as ever. What a shit stain he is on this country.

930662346187530240 2017-11-14 05:02:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @ddiamond Probably the same ones feigning shock and horror over Weinstein, Ailes and Moore
930660233831178245 2017-11-14 04:54:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @aldotcom Seems like Moore recycled a letter from before the election
930659284521713669 2017-11-14 04:50:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @seanhannity publicly humiliated himself with his support of Moore and now backtracking so fast he humiliated himself even more
930056659367596033 2017-11-13 12:56:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP The @gop will know be known as the party of sexual assault and pedophilia with Trump and Moore. That its the party of liars & hypocrites is a given
929688387430297600 2017-11-12 12:32:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOPSenate @SenateGOP dont give a damn  Panel Votes to Turn Blogger Without Trial Experience Into a Federal Judgehttp://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/11/11/senate_panel_approves_brett_j_talley_a_lawyer_without_trial_experience_for.html

925706170458886144 2017-11-01 12:48:44 UTC <Bearnmind> 58 dead/489 injured in Vegas are less important than 8 dead/12 injured in NYC to @realDonaldTrump. Difference? Vegas terrorist was white
925705506689355777 2017-11-01 12:46:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump had different reactions to Las Vegas and NYC. Why is the loss of life/injuries in NYC worthy of policy but Vegas isnt?
925572739599126528 2017-10-31 03:58:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @WalshFreedom @brianbeutler @pattymo I guess his call to action only applies to anyone who isnt white. Its not like 500+ people got shot in Las Vegas or anything
925572258751565824 2017-10-31 03:56:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @WLOX Dying Dad? That word choice wasnt the best and IMO is insensitive. How about Terminally Ill Dad

925354427120095238 2017-10-31 13:31:02 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey @realDonaldTrump @POTUS - Trumps average approval -33 percent, the lowest of his presidency, w/62 percent disapproving.
925353514896953344 2017-10-31 13:27:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @CNNJason I bet John Kelly is going to miss his credibility and integrity
925352829702811650 2017-10-31 13:24:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Wow you just can stop. He was one of the 1st people that you names as a foreign policy advisor. Your failing memory is just SAD
925172683263873024 2017-10-30 01:28:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @ddale8 Wow, General Kelly just throwing away all credibility and integrity. Trump has that effect  on people evidently

925088932949381120 2017-10-30 19:56:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @TheRickWilson @PressSec ability to lie (with a straight face and crooked eyebrows) surpasses @seanspicer on a good day. Teaching her kids lying is ok

922967339150299136 2017-10-24 23:25:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins In Trumps @GOP its a bombshell when people stand up for their convictions. @JeffFlake clearly isnt willing to sell his integrity
922966801318858752 2017-10-24 23:23:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Hahaha. They hate your guts. As does most of the globe.
922966682527764481 2017-10-24 23:22:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedNews @PressSec is right. Trump has divided this country and threatened our democracy more than any other POTUS. Shes a horrible person
922966413932933120 2017-10-24 23:21:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum And lying is a sign of character in @PressSec Such BS, hes an ass and shes a liar

921365343490248704 2017-10-20 13:19:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics That ones easy. Trumps go to is the gutter. Money cant buy class, compassion or empathy

920674257583136773 2017-10-18 15:33:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @PaulBegala @rgoodlaw Sounds like Mitch Landrieu was correct in his assessment of @attorneygeneral @JeffSession
920670492146708482 2017-10-18 15:18:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @Evan_McMullin How many hearings were there again on Benghazi? @SenateGOP @HouseGOP are hypocritical cowards
920670010569261056 2017-10-18 15:16:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @colbyhall Which says a lot about Trump supporters
920669535681830912 2017-10-18 15:14:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump As always you lie. But coming from a coward who dodged the draft and an unhinged narcissist, its not surprising
920669289945927682 2017-10-18 15:13:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @SykesCharlie Because its Trump
919597038496489472 2017-10-15 16:13:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @mitchellvii Thats a despicable thing to say. No matter @SenJohnMcCain political views, he is a hero and deserves respect for serving and surviving
919596745239150593 2017-10-15 16:12:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum I bet he doesnt
919596587050942466 2017-10-15 16:11:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @SykesCharlie While I dont agree with many of your views, I appreciate you standing up to Trump.
919557309776273414 2017-10-15 13:35:21 UTC <Bearnmind> I cant believe my city did this. Biloxi is full of wonderful people. But given MS history, this book is a must readhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/juliareinstein/thats-the-point?utm_term=.iwMk1P7RLL#.iwMk1P7RLL
919378463303204864 2017-10-14 01:44:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @GreggJarrett @FoxNews So when can we expect the announcement that youre shutting down? You were talking about Ailes I assume.
919378252027662337 2017-10-14 01:43:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @KevinMKruse So we can expect an announcement that @FoxNews is going away?
919364571000815616 2017-10-14 00:49:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @DavidAFrench Because the definition of a Christian seems to be fluid these days
919364389009895424 2017-10-14 00:48:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @BrendanNyhan @EricLiptonNYT Is there a man who looks more unattractive in golf clothes than @realDonaldTrump ?  You just know he does the mirror, mirror thing
919304098863656960 2017-10-14 20:49:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedNews Weird how no one did anything until his actions became public. No way they werent aware he was such a dick
919303652963008512 2017-10-14 20:47:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @benjaminwittes He must be trying to get some
919290985602891776 2017-10-14 19:57:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump And raise premiums for the people who voted for you
919290847794888709 2017-10-14 19:56:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Hahahaha. Now thats funny
918969984763568128 2017-10-13 22:41:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @DonaldJTrumpJr Hey Junior, your Daddy sexually assaulted numerous women. Hardly a moral compass. Glass houses Junior
918896184000835585 2017-10-13 17:48:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Sounds like Fox and Ailes or Fox & OReilly. Glass Houses...
918854586739326979 2017-10-13 15:02:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN Who is they?
918854430006525953 2017-10-13 15:02:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Youre despicable. Holding peoples healthcare as leverage. What happened to you that you lack compassion or empathy?
918662614481215488 2017-10-12 02:20:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Great, youve decided to put the country first and resign.
918662319218966528 2017-10-12 02:18:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson You must be talking about Roger Ailes and Fox.
918518099644731393 2017-10-12 16:45:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @JuddLegum You know @foxnews is thanking God that its someone other than a Fox executive or host
918515462744535041 2017-10-12 16:35:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @TwitterSafety Yet you let Roger stone spew vile content
918515299640598528 2017-10-12 16:34:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @Acosta @CNN How about long enough to get electricity, food, water & hospitals. Or is that not important since theyre not Texas or FLA?
918515073861156865 2017-10-12 16:33:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum A little late
918514952989806592 2017-10-12 16:33:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @Sarcasticsapien What I find appalling is he wouldnt have gotten help had it not been made public. Hed have kept abusing women. Hes only sorry its public
918513697064210433 2017-10-12 16:28:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @Cernovich You really sold your souls to the devil with that humdinger of a lie
918513477551050753 2017-10-12 16:27:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN Can someone get @realDonaldTrump the Presidency for Dummies book?
918512522730332161 2017-10-12 16:23:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Once a racist always a racist & @attorneygeneral Sessions is a racist
918471089889652736 2017-10-12 13:39:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoyAnnReid And was vilified for it
918470944959729665 2017-10-12 13:38:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke Go away. Your desperation for attention and to be a celebrity is showing
918468909350649856 2017-10-12 13:30:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Just get rid of that pesky 1st amendment because youre being called out on your lies and incompetence?
918468337134424064 2017-10-12 13:28:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Unfortunately most of his supporters will believe that
917911934225305600 2017-10-10 00:37:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @KellyannePolls Well given your vehement denouncement of Trump for sexually assaulting women, youre not at all a lying hypocrite
917911722555596801 2017-10-10 00:36:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @HillaryClinton @TuckerCarlson Yet Bill OReilly, a man who sexually harassed women for years, is making guest appearances on @foxnews. Hypocrisy much?
917823420699639808 2017-10-10 18:45:30 UTC <Bearnmind> 2/2 @DIRECTV a month. No idea when it will be fixed and too bad we dont have TV. This is unacceptable.
917822251826851841 2017-10-10 18:40:51 UTC <Bearnmind> 1/2 @DIRECTV after spending hours on the phone with Direct b/c mini-genies dont work, they say they have a software issue lasting over
917718874887544837 2017-10-10 11:50:04 UTC <Bearnmind> So basically Corker was right.  White House aides lean on delays and distraction to manage Trump http://politi.co/2y8u3MQ via @politico
917552230168920069 2017-10-09 00:47:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenBobCorker @DavidWright_CNN @KellyannePolls is fine w/Trump tweeting lies & attacking people on Twitter. What she lacks in morals/integrity she makes up in hypocrisy
917549258093617152 2017-10-09 00:36:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC What a kiss ass youve become
917455116852187136 2017-10-09 18:22:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @CNNnewsroom Is there anyone in the @gop who doesnt lie anymore?
917379306568994816 2017-10-09 13:20:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @DonaldJTrumpJr You do know youre related to the most tremendous, bigly sexual assaulter of them all? Does the phrase grab em by the pussy ring a bell?
917378517997883392 2017-10-09 13:17:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @DonaldJTrumpJr Ok Junior, did you forget that according to you and your daddy The NY Times is fake news? Hypocrisy much?
917377205591830529 2017-10-09 13:12:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump has done one thing right. He will leave a legacy. One of division, hate, racism and incompetencehttps://www.thedailybeast.com/the-enormous-emotional-toll-of-trumpism

917198605089419264 2017-10-08 01:22:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @greenfield64 As was true with @FoxNews and every other org. Theyre fine with it until it becomes public, then they suddenly develop morals and ethics
917198017115099136 2017-10-08 01:20:22 UTC <Bearnmind> So very thankful that Biloxi was able to weather #HurricaneNate as well as it did. The state government is awful but MEMA is great.
917197374396796928 2017-10-08 01:17:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @GOP No. I pray each night that God protects us from Trump and the GOP cowards who are complicit in his racism and incompetence
917194841477517312 2017-10-08 01:07:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Hey Dotard, Corker voted against the Iran deal. Your incompetence and lies are mind-boggling
917194106283192322 2017-10-08 01:04:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN Has there every been a more petty POTUS?
917193957712498688 2017-10-08 01:04:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @WLOX Good. Hes no better than Ailes and OReilly and should have to pay the same price
917096749411590144 2017-10-08 18:37:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenBobCorker Thank you Sen Corker for standing up to Trump.
917096164381614087 2017-10-08 18:35:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @VP Might I tell you about an amendment known as the 1st amendment you dweeb.
917095778962821120 2017-10-08 18:34:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump You got owned by Corker and you know it.
917095672733675521 2017-10-08 18:33:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Sure he did, now go back to your baby desk and whine
917095195883302914 2017-10-08 18:31:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @POTUS @VP What BS. You just want to say so in your POTUS run. If you cared about disrespect/dishonor, youd have resigned rather than work for Trump
917003309713633280 2017-10-08 12:26:40 UTC <Bearnmind> All good in our neighborhood. We lost a shingle. Theres some small tree limbs in yards but we were very lucky #HurricaneNate

916629479761633280 2017-10-07 11:41:12 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey @CNN Remember that land mass between NO and Mobile that was devastated by Katrina? Thats Mississippi.http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/07/us/hurricane-nate-forecast/index.html
916459682822225920 2017-10-06 00:26:30 UTC <Bearnmind> Its like the @weatherchannel hates the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
916339310357614592 2017-10-06 16:28:11 UTC <Bearnmind> Yet again the news media ignores threat of Mississippi Gulf Coast when it comes to Hurricane Nate.

915944924499017730 2017-10-05 14:21:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @thehill Well that solves everything. Everybody use your AR-15s appropriately. How about no one needs assault weapons?
915944559720501248 2017-10-05 14:19:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @michikokakutani So were allowing mass shooting to appease 21% of Americans? @HouseGOP @SenateGOP value NRA money over American lives. #VoteThemOut

914514087622660096 2017-10-01 15:35:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @stuartpstevens Same way Sessions did. They give up their self-respect and agree to be subjected to public humiliation

914292656435597319 2017-09-30 00:55:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump And that matters why? Your ego is unbelievable
914291803972603906 2017-09-30 00:52:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @TheRickWilson But theyll give him a pass because there is no low they wont excuse. The @gop has lost its soul, integrity, ethics...

912820631435083776 2017-09-26 23:26:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @TPM @joshtpm More fraud, waste and abuse
912820560081584128 2017-09-26 23:25:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood Ive been trying to figure that out myself
912790917727309824 2017-09-26 21:28:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @RonBrownstein And a @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP who  either support him or keep silent.
912790653737762816 2017-09-26 21:27:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @Phil_Mattingly Now @SpeakerRyan and McConnell can get to work on giving the wealthy & corporations a tax break and screwing over everyone else
912789956283846658 2017-09-26 21:24:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @stuartpstevens As someone who lives in MS, they dont spend the $ well. The thought of h/c in @GovPhilBryant & state legislators hands is terrifying
912789547469111296 2017-09-26 21:22:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @NOLAnews So he supports telling people when and how they can protest. Yeah, the 1st amendment says otherwise.
912789137857679362 2017-09-26 21:21:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @martajewson And thats the problem. Bad cops arent convicted. Half the time theyre never even charged.
912788559001726981 2017-09-26 21:18:45 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey @realDonaldTrump - your tweets just keep roiling you again and again.https://twitter.com/pbump/status/912695895480832000
912788330793840640 2017-09-26 21:17:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @StevenTDennis @sahilkapur Please, please, please do it
912788034621501441 2017-09-26 21:16:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @samstein Everybody is referring to the voices in his head I guess
912786596285558784 2017-09-26 21:10:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @woodruffbets And his support of Trumps NFL feud shows @attorneygeneral has no credibility on the issue of 1st amendment. Once a racist always a racist
912785876186431493 2017-09-26 21:08:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood In all seriousness, the level of delusion is alarming. He needs a mental evaluation.
912785569314430978 2017-09-26 21:06:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @attorneygeneral wasting taxpayer $ because he got his feelings hurt. Seriously.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/woman-laughed-jeff-sessions_us_59a8cb8ae4b0b5e530fd7c8b?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 # via @HuffPostPol
912757270332747781 2017-09-26 19:14:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire Its truly hard to take even @SenJohnMcCain seriously abt bipartisanship given how the @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP @SenateGOP treated Obama
912756953046306816 2017-09-26 19:13:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @ABC If anyone is burning @Saints season tickets, stop, DM me. Ill buy them.
912755786119557122 2017-09-26 19:08:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeed The @NFL owners are hypocrites. They blackball Kaepernick but say they support players rights to protest
912755489443807232 2017-09-26 19:07:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @LisaWashing @steelers @CBSPittsburgh Says a lot about a man that when he gets angry he uses racial slurs. Makes you believe he uses them all the time in his head
912737329613242370 2017-09-26 17:55:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshrogin Can he even read? We know he cant spell.
912736977040084992 2017-09-26 17:53:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @kylegriffin1 You know what would really make Trump crazier than he already is? If everyone, including media, ignored his tweets. Lets try that
912731721820524545 2017-09-26 17:32:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @kylegriffin1 Poor Barron. He doesnt stand a chance. Hell be judged by the sins of his father his entire life
912730834909777922 2017-09-26 17:29:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @kylegriffin1 @TidwellPonce What he said is inaccurate. Interior employees serve the public and the constitution not the Sec or the President
912730558987407360 2017-09-26 17:28:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @kylegriffin1 @pinky01105 99% of Interior employees are truly dedicated public servants who serve the people & the constitution not the Sec or the President
912729964562325504 2017-09-26 17:25:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @kylegriffin1 Or to the flag. Evidently to him the flag, himself & Trump are one and the same. Clearly Zinke wasnt paying attention to the oath he swore
912729324725456897 2017-09-26 17:23:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm @TPM Heard the speech on the radio. Hes an awful speaker & @attorneygeneral insincerity came through. A racist cant credibly talk about rights
912726641746563075 2017-09-26 17:12:43 UTC <Bearnmind> Even though @jeffsessions @attorneygeneral is a terrible public speaker, he sounds so insincere talking about free speech & civil rights
912710784458862592 2017-09-26 16:09:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeed The eloquence
912694765321408512 2017-09-26 15:06:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins Junior got scared?

912641226062667776 2017-09-26 11:33:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @DylanByers @Gooms @Fingers66 It was my understanding that hes been asked to preserve them and turn them over by 10/9.
912519498011430912 2017-09-25 03:29:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @Kanew @rpmohriii Its safe to say the Office hasnt changed him at all
912518793582215168 2017-09-25 03:26:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @BillCassidy Why do you lie so much?  Have you decided emulating Trump is the way to raise your natl profile? Planning a POTUS run?
912518437553000450 2017-09-25 03:25:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @DylanByers @Gooms @Fingers66 He has the highest security clearance, no way to know for sure until/if they turn over the emails
912511099370696704 2017-09-25 02:56:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @greenfield64 It should never have taken this long. Its not like they didnt know Maria was coming. They learned nothing from Katrina
912510714782371841 2017-09-25 02:54:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @DavidBegnaud Its like Katrina all over again. Has the government learned nothing?  People are suffering. This should be the govt top priorities
912505684582961153 2017-09-25 02:34:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @justicedems Or Presidents who lose the popular vote. #electoralreform
912504722455744512 2017-09-25 02:30:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @yashar @newtgingrich must have been looking in the mirror by mistake. Hes an unethical, immoral, race-baiting, bitter old man.
912504485666312194 2017-09-25 02:29:57 UTC <Bearnmind> Wonder if most of our countrys issues could be fixed if we just repealed and replaced our politicians and our political system #TermLimits
912504202580123648 2017-09-25 02:28:50 UTC <Bearnmind> I seldom refer to my friends as lefty or righty. Im so sick of hearing left/right &  red/blue applied to everything.
912503632536440834 2017-09-25 02:26:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @BlackDragonfly5 Ive met lots of doctors who were assholes just in it for the money. @BillCassidy just wants to raise his natl profile
912501858794655744 2017-09-25 02:19:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @SouthBoulder Yes gerrymandering makes it possible to vote out no one
912501237010006016 2017-09-25 02:17:03 UTC <Bearnmind> Alexander and Murray were able to make progress in bipartisan talks on h/c. Maybe no one is into you @BillCassidy #HealthCareDebate

912498741898285056 2017-09-25 02:07:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP paid taxpayer funded salary/benefits for 8 years & accomplished nothing but to use race to divide us. #VoteThemOut
912494004394184704 2017-09-25 01:48:18 UTC <Bearnmind> Yet another old tweet that shows the hypocrisy of @realDonaldTrump He is in so far over his head and he knows it. Hes a failure.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/387565483303923712
912493608141557761 2017-09-25 01:46:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @JakeSherman @SopanDeb Trump envies respect & admiration @SenJohnMcCain commands even from those who disagree w/him.  He resents McCain for being a better man
912492657523470336 2017-09-25 01:42:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Since you put no one but yourself first, its hard for you to understand @SenJohnMcCain - hell leave a legacy, history will excoriate you
912492249711341568 2017-09-25 01:41:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump I can see how strange it must seem to you to see 3 Senators incl @SenJohnMcCain holding to their principles and integrity.
912473742080663552 2017-09-25 00:27:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @grossdm And more than in the state of Mississippi
912473271865630720 2017-09-25 00:25:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump It must be pretty in your imaginary world where people like & respect you. IRL, majority of Americans detest you and have no respect for you
912472892570587136 2017-09-25 00:24:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @slpng_giants Hey @amazon why are you trying to force prime members to leave by advertising & supporting racist sites that incite hatred? Tired of my $$ ?
912472319435689986 2017-09-25 00:22:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @DylanByers @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Im waiting for the outrage and chants of lock them up
912472077998977024 2017-09-25 00:21:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @stuartpstevens Hey now, youve gone too far. Dont be bad-mouthing the Tigers
912470993062547459 2017-09-25 00:16:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire I work at Interior and I had to swear an oath to be loyal to the Constitution (like all Fed employees do) not to Secretary or the President
912449577894236162 2017-09-25 22:51:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins Our access to healthcare depends on @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins and @lisamurkowski (dont trust Paul) putting  country first.

912446633618624512 2017-09-25 22:40:04 UTC <Bearnmind> This is so sad but @SenJohnMcCain has cemented his legacy of country first by saving the Senate from itself & healthcare for millionshttps://twitter.com/60minutes/status/912108231555796993
912445903318933509 2017-09-25 22:37:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump WOW, you must feel foolish know. Lord knows you look like a fool to the rest of the world. POTUS of this great country is a laughingstock
912406988553965575 2017-09-25 20:02:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @Breaking911 Wonder if he was unable to sleep after he raped a girl too?
912406663478603776 2017-09-25 20:01:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Megyn Kelly has always been overrated.
912406309567418369 2017-09-25 19:59:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood Hes pro-flag, anti Americans that arent white men/women in his base

912375401145556995 2017-09-25 17:57:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @ThePeterPaige @ScottNevins @musicrocksit452 Which shows just how little they think of their own bill. Instead of arguing to Murtowski/McCain on merits, they try and bribe them
912374796595449856 2017-09-25 17:54:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Wow
912358256084963329 2017-09-25 16:48:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Have you even read the bill? Millions of people lose health/care, sick, elderly and women punished under this bill. Only winners are donors
912357845919834112 2017-09-25 16:47:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN Todays @GOP = white men & racists terrified of becoming a minority & blaming them for all their woes. When America wakes up, watch out
912357450682191872 2017-09-25 16:45:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Right because confederate flags arent disrespectful at all. You dont even hide your racism & bigotry anymore. History will not be kind
912357264907960321 2017-09-25 16:44:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood A sport of primarily white men vs a sport with a majority of African Americans but its not about race.  Such bullshit
912357008531165184 2017-09-25 16:43:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN With Trump everything is about us versus them. Hes a racist. And the @GOP is fast becoming a white nationalist party. That cant be undone
912356712681738250 2017-09-25 16:42:45 UTC <Bearnmind> Any good will/Press @realDonaldTrump @POTUS has gotten over response to Harvey/Irma has been underminded by lack of action in Puerto Rico
912356452479782912 2017-09-25 16:41:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @jdawsey1 @burgessev Maybe then the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP can get off their collective asses and help Puerto Rico. Their inaction is appalling
912355103402860544 2017-09-25 16:36:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @RogerJStoneJr Youre a vile, despicable man. @SenJohnMcCain has more integrity in his little finger than youve ever had.
912354861123072007 2017-09-25 16:35:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @samstein And when would that be @SpeakerRyan - when people get sick from drinking dirty water or dehydrate from no water at all or when they starve?
912354436533637121 2017-09-25 16:33:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR I wonder if @realDonaldTrump @POTUS understands that people in Puerto Rico are American citizens
912304837903216642 2017-09-25 13:16:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump America used to be a shining city on a hill. Under you, weve become a cautionary tale.
912304711931453440 2017-09-25 13:16:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump It has everything to do with race. Charlottesville showed youre a racist.
912303814803369984 2017-09-25 13:12:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Why dont you have some respect for the men/women who died to protect our right to protest. Pay attention to PUERTO RICO.
912279114467422208 2017-09-25 11:34:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Puerto Rico is more important than sports. People are suffering.
912165529992998912 2017-09-24 04:03:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @chrislhayes @pkcapitol @EW_squared I think hes opposing just for publicity. Hell vote yes
912155914781839360 2017-09-24 03:24:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @pkcapitol I pray she, @lisamurkowski and @SenJohnMcCain stand their ground. The lives of millions of Americans depend on them

912155214723141632 2017-09-24 03:22:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler The way he attacked a Gold Star family who lost their son.
912154870572109824 2017-09-24 03:20:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @politico @rachanadixit Hopefully @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain & Sen Collins put the American people first & vote no to a bill that no one knows the impact of
912154587863375872 2017-09-24 03:19:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @politico @rachanadixit If they truly believe this was a good bill why not hold hearings to explain the bill and get the peoples support?
912153754098683904 2017-09-24 03:16:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @daveweigel @dylanlscott Why are the @gop and @SenateGOP so desperate to deprive millions of healthcare with a bill the majority of Americans dont support?  Donors.
912153566101610496 2017-09-24 03:15:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @dylanlscott The @SenateGOP are still trying to pass a bill without knowing the impact and with every medical association against it.
912153219782119425 2017-09-24 03:14:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @TomiLahren Congrats to Trump and the @gop for using racism as a political weapon to divide America even further. Youre a hypocrite
912152716272652289 2017-09-24 03:12:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @greenfield64 Its unbelievable.  Why is Puerto Rico and 3 million suffering Americans not as important as Houston or Florida?
912129517682077696 2017-09-24 01:39:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @aterkel Yet he supported Trump
912128916860612608 2017-09-24 01:37:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @newtgingrich @FoxNews You gave up the right to talk about patriotism given your ethics issues as Speaker.  Your POTUS run showed you that were so done w/you
912127971997241346 2017-09-24 01:33:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea Um not at all. Shes the reason I stopped watching
912127112596869121 2017-09-24 01:30:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @Eugene_Scott For Trump, the @GOP racism is a political tool to win votes appealing to the worst in us. We have to get out & vote in every election.
912125996945625089 2017-09-24 01:25:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @NicolleDWallace And they should never condone the President using his office to attack private citizens. The Presidency has been defiled by Trump.
912125577259311104 2017-09-24 01:24:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNightlyNews Every headline, breaking news, & chyrons should be about getting help to Puerto Rico
912125245536063488 2017-09-24 01:22:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Where is the emergency aid bill for Puerto Rico. This should be your top priority.
912124031352102912 2017-09-24 01:18:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN Every rally is overwhelmingly white and he always says we and our. The man is a racist pure and simple. And his supporters love it
912123352734732290 2017-09-24 01:15:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @agolis Seems Zuckerberg thinks hes the only smart man in the room. He has an ego that rivals Trumps
912123080092393472 2017-09-24 01:14:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @MercedesJavid @_DestineyRose_ @alexbeech @Bravotv instead of more shows w/women tearing other women down (your wheelhouse clearly)put the best show you have @ThePeoplesCouch back on
912122586749906945 2017-09-24 01:12:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @DonaldJTrumpJr If only you werent sticking your nose in things you know nothing about Junior.  Let the adults talk
912122249238466566 2017-09-24 01:11:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump You could better spend your time helping 3+ million Americans in Puerto Rico instead of whining about people exercising 1st amend rights
912121352789913600 2017-09-24 01:07:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump If a man gets the privilege of being President, he should protect all Americans rights. Youre a small, petty man.
912084318834642946 2017-09-24 22:40:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @ASlavitt Praying we can count on @lisamurkowski to put the health of Alaskans and all Americans first. Every med assoc is against this bill.
912054504195018754 2017-09-24 20:41:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol I find flag underwear much more disrespectful than silently kneeling in support of those with no voice
912054014195494912 2017-09-24 20:39:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler @jonlovett Well said
912052975832649728 2017-09-24 20:35:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias My father and husband who both served in combat zones would agree.
912052812007211013 2017-09-24 20:35:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias So we can expect to see the FBI investigate this, @HouseGOP @SenateGOP express outrage and say hes unfit to be working in the White House?
912052202830798848 2017-09-24 20:32:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @maggieNYT A POTUS using his office to attack private citizens. @realDonaldTrump has dragged the Office into the gutter. The @gop must be so proud
912051780162375682 2017-09-24 20:31:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @ddiamond A millionaire @HHSGov Sec abuses taxpayer money for his convenience. Seems like Dotard in Chief brought the swamp with him
912051305832644608 2017-09-24 20:29:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @kumailn This from a racist bigot who served one term in Congress and who would need a lobotomy to say anything remotely intelligent
912050736434962432 2017-09-24 20:26:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @WalshFreedom Stevie Wonder overcame great odds, is an inspiration to millions & earned his money. Dotard inherited his $ and inspires no one. You racist
912038557119901697 2017-09-24 19:38:31 UTC <Bearnmind> For @realDonaldTrump who has a pathetic and desperate need to be liked, this shows hell never get what he so desperately craveshttps://twitter.com/abc/status/911802670977097728
912031836590809089 2017-09-24 19:11:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @mitchellvii Stripping away the first amendment rights. I dont find kneeling during the national anthem as disrespectful as I find flag underwear
912021891489165314 2017-09-24 18:32:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @TomiLahren Can you shut up too?
912021833020530689 2017-09-24 18:32:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @Kaepernick7 @DineshDSouza Its truly sad how much hate and bigotry you have in your heart
912021227950280705 2017-09-24 18:29:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump The locked arms are in support of the players you Dotard
912009770525233154 2017-09-24 17:44:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @stuartpstevens My opinion of Rex Ryan dropped as soon as I heard I supported Trump
912009478169677826 2017-09-24 17:42:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @mattyglesias Cant imagine what the difference is
911986979763625984 2017-09-24 16:13:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @seanhannity Im sure the NFL will be devastated
911985702312841216 2017-09-24 16:08:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @jfreewright @WalshFreedom is mentally incapable of not saying something that is stupid, bigoted and racist. Thats who he is. Hes despicable
911973476281569280 2017-09-24 15:19:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol It must be hard on @realDonaldTrump massive and unwarranted ego to be made a fool of repeatedly.
911965938899091456 2017-09-24 14:49:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN Yeah but clearly @realDonaldTrump is unfamiliar with the constitution he swore to uphold
911801021583826944 2017-09-23 03:54:38 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey Dotard @realDonaldTrump @POTUS since youre so incompetent and clearly ignorant, maybe this will help you understand.https://twitter.com/koopa_kinte/status/911715150507454464
911795000459059200 2017-09-23 03:30:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @cristianafarias @Scotus has become a political institution. In that case, there should be no lifetime appointments

911754372673130496 2017-09-23 00:49:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump hmm, you should be fired, Dotardhttps://twitter.com/atdavidhoffman/status/911637158640934917
911750375769825281 2017-09-23 00:33:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @BenSasse Maybe you should stand by your convictions and not vote for everything Trump wants. Youre all talk no action
911749822088085504 2017-09-23 00:31:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @ChrisRBarron @nflcommish As a lifelong and avid football fan (Who Dat!), I wont watch if they fire players for protesting. Id hate it but Id do it
911748222376448002 2017-09-23 00:24:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @BenSasse Soldiers died to give people the freedom to protest.
911747872642789378 2017-09-23 00:23:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump If an incompetent Dotard wants the privilege of being President, he should act like one.
911747654086008833 2017-09-23 00:22:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @kylenabecker Um, the 1st amendment, maybe youve heard of it?  Democracy? The @GOP just keeps digging its hole as a white nationalist party
911590390792376321 2017-09-23 13:57:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Youre are the most thin-skinned bully ever. News flash Dotard - most Americans dont like you

911353305808408576 2017-09-22 22:15:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @politico Is there a woman who looks unhappier than @FLOTUS ? Can you imagine the misery of being married to Trump? She clearly finds him repulsive
911352948504002560 2017-09-22 22:14:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @SykesCharlie The description of NKs leader personality traits could be written about @realDonaldTrump - 2 incompetent & narcissistic bullies
911352114143727619 2017-09-22 22:10:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Given your history as a gaudy Dotard, its not a surprise that you support your cabinet Secretaries waste/abuse of taxpayer money
911351428962283520 2017-09-22 22:08:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @kaitlancollins I am too and with Strange and Moore as the ones they want to represent them in Congress, Im not proud of it
911351045787447296 2017-09-22 22:06:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain @jimmykimmel @politico Sad thing is out of 52 @SenateGOP only 3 put the people and the country over party.
911350565954781184 2017-09-22 22:04:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonathanchait Ruthlessness is @GOP core principles along with lack of integrity, lack of credibility, lying and putting party over country
911350249830182919 2017-09-22 22:03:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @SteveSchmidtSES And with the current incompetent @usedgov Secretary its going to get worse
911349462618054656 2017-09-22 22:00:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @samstein @HHSGov you work for us. I worked for HHS for 22 yrs. This is despicable. You are supposed to serve the people not harm them
911348885876076544 2017-09-22 21:58:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @KFILE Shes just regular folks. Lol
911348705034407936 2017-09-22 21:57:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler So if they cant take away h/c, Trumps admin will sabotage people trying to get it under the ACA. Ridiculous
911348224421765122 2017-09-22 21:55:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @LOLGOP @ASlavitt @Skwidj Good point. Hopefully anyone who does emerge builds back the moderate wing and not more extreme right wing
911292627710070786 2017-09-22 18:14:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias Cementing @SenJohnMcCain legacy as a maverick who put America over party.
911291665813577729 2017-09-22 18:10:38 UTC <Bearnmind> I pray the the @SenateGOP regain their senses and follow @SenJohnMcCain example and go back to being adults. Bipartisanship benefits all
911291197255188480 2017-09-22 18:08:47 UTC <Bearnmind> We owe a debt of gratitude to @SenJohnMcCain for standing strong -McCainwon't back GrahamCassidybill, likely endinghttp://www.cnn.com/2017/09/22/politics/john-mccain-health-care/index.html

911287291930451969 2017-09-22 17:53:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @senrobportman @ASlavitt @justdreamin91 If @SenJohnMcCain and @lisamurkowski dont take a stand/force Senate back to regular order, no basis to bitch when Dems control & do same
911286572728946694 2017-09-22 17:50:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol @CitizenCohn @SenateGOP is rewarding states that deliberately decided to keep citizens uninsured by not expanding Medicaid
911286294701015043 2017-09-22 17:49:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonfavs The @SenateGOP have lost their collectives minds, and integrity and credibility and their decency, the list goes on and on #midterms
911285942337572864 2017-09-22 17:47:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Because as @BillCassidy knows, Trump never lies. Cassidy has truly sold Americans with this bill, along with his credibility and integrity
911285631162175488 2017-09-22 17:46:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol The lack of common courtesy is one of the things I miss most under Trump. Its like everyones Id has been set free

911056297323368449 2017-09-21 02:35:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @SteveSchmidtSES It seemed a little odd, usually they send Epidemiologists not the Secretary
911056034764087296 2017-09-21 02:34:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonfavs What purpose does Congress serve if theyre trying to ram through bills without knowing whats in them or the impact of them?
911044104745885696 2017-09-21 01:46:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @politico @facebook at least not after its made public anyway
911016649159004160 2017-09-21 23:57:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee Why? He was lying and the Manafort surveillance doesnt say any different. As racist and stupid as you are hard to believe you were Gov
911010228312973313 2017-09-21 23:32:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @EWErickson How about theyre upset because its a waste and abuse of taxpayer money. Or are you no longer against fraud, waste and abuse?

910948307672997890 2017-09-21 19:26:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum And if @lisamurkowski goes for it, shes knowingly throwing the rest of the country to the insurance wolves. Please vote no

910888213182652417 2017-09-21 15:27:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Yeah, good luck with that
910888111554613249 2017-09-21 15:27:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol @rweingarten This Congress is an enemy of the people. 3 Senators are our best hope to protect us and our children from the @GOPSenMajority.

910881352551149573 2017-09-21 15:00:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Now substitute the words your child/grandchild in place of Jimmy Kimmels sonhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/09/20/politics/jimmy-kimmel-son-graham-cassidy/index.html
910859954273255429 2017-09-21 13:35:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @RebeccaMorin_ @politico a lot of former Press Secretaries were hired by networks. @seanspicer is so toxic even Fox News wont touch him. Thats gotta hurt
910859533299408897 2017-09-21 13:33:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @RebeccaMorin_ @politico @seanspicer is a weasel. Reputation, credibility, & integrity in tatters & still wont take ownership.
910858440641253381 2017-09-21 13:29:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain If you dont force @SenateGOP back to regular order, who will. If the Senate doesnt do its job, what good is it anymore?

910856967467487233 2017-09-21 13:23:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @LaurenWeberHP @HuffPostPol What does it say about our politics that 3 Senators hold the fate of peoples healthcare in their hands & have to protect us from the rest
910856708943220737 2017-09-21 13:22:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @ditzkoff Senate Intelligence is an oxymoron
910856538306301952 2017-09-21 13:21:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @KFILE @McCormackJohn @seanspicer finding out there may be consequences to knowingly lying to the American public. I bet hell be the 1st one to roll on Trump
910856260161064960 2017-09-21 13:20:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @poniewozik At least he said Thanks
910856043911053314 2017-09-21 13:19:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics Yet to keep his jobs so he can continue to do nothing except run for re-election @LindseyGrahamSC throws Americans under the bus of donors
910855707016212480 2017-09-21 13:18:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @TimothyNoah1 Wow, sounds like @seanspicer has something to hide. Im sure if you offered him $$ to talk, he would. His integrity/credibility is for sale
910855025794134016 2017-09-21 13:15:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @ASlavitt Our politics are irrevocably broken when pissed off donors cause @SenateGOP to take away healthcare from millions of Americans #VoteThemOut
910854528181968896 2017-09-21 13:13:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol And I pray @SenJohnMcCain and @lisamurkowski dont abandon the people to support what they know is a bad bill.  Lives > party/politics
910699688420102144 2017-09-20 02:58:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP odd how organizations who actually know healthcare and care about peoples health hate your bill. But you guys are the experts.https://twitter.com/citizencohn/status/910696795902267392
910694233648005120 2017-09-20 02:36:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @BillCassidy will sell out and lie to his constituents to raise his natl profile. Every study, fact check says hes lying about this bill
910693155770699776 2017-09-20 02:32:22 UTC <Bearnmind> Its a shame @BillCassidy sacrificed his integrity/credibility for his awful healthcare bill. Lying has become contagious on Capitol Hillhttps://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/910566813796376576
910689202433531904 2017-09-20 02:16:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @politico Yet @FLOTUS lives with the biggest bully of them all. It kills her credibility on this cause
910678820721586177 2017-09-20 01:35:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @GaryLegum Its pretty clear that @realDonaldTrump feels himself inferior to Obama. So does the majority of the country.
910677803124715521 2017-09-20 01:31:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @politico The example @PressSec is setting for her kids - that lying is ok- is heartbreaking. Makes you wonder if theyll be ashamed of her
910677102311043072 2017-09-20 01:28:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @JesseLehrich And when their constituents lose their healthcare and Medicaid, then what?
910674255985106944 2017-09-20 01:17:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @GaryLegum Americas word will mean nothing to the rest of the world. We will be considered untrustworthy. Another way Trump is killing our country
910673334357991424 2017-09-20 01:13:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenThadCochran @RogerWicker Wheres your video explaining how Graham-Cassidy benefits MS citizens? 38% of whom depend on Medicaid?https://twitter.com/chrismurphyct/status/910581663591223297

910672018508537856 2017-09-20 01:08:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Seriously, educate yourself before saying stupid things like this.

910668923363717120 2017-09-20 00:56:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @sassygayrepub @factsplaining Asking people to pay your medical bills because you didnt want to buy insurance. Truly sorry for your pain but take out a loan
910667487930232832 2017-09-20 00:50:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @ChuckGrassley @jasonnobleDMR Brilliant legislating. No matter how many people it hurts, the bill has to pass because we promised to hurt people. We serve only ourselves
910667070534180865 2017-09-20 00:48:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump It doesnt and either you havent read it  or dont understand it or youre lying. Both are equally possible

910575562212524032 2017-09-20 18:45:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN @GOPSenMajority doesn't care about the impact even to their own states. They stopped caring about Americans and this country years ago

910570935333249024 2017-09-20 18:26:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @NPR @BillCassidy They also can charge higher premiums for sick, eliminate essential benefits. But you don't actually care about people's healthcare do you?
910570569002708993 2017-09-20 18:25:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonfavs That's @KellyannePolls and @SecPriceMD setting the example of gov't fraud, waste and abuse.
910569974422368256 2017-09-20 18:22:54 UTC <Bearnmind> This is who the @SenateGOP should be listening to before they pass a bill condemning people to death b/c they can't afford h/c insurancehttps://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/910533551736676352
910568880631717888 2017-09-20 18:18:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum I honestly believe something is mentally wrong with him. No empathy or compassion at all. And the @POTUS doesn't get to block anyone

909963360480796672 2017-09-18 02:12:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @BillCassidy @rebekahgeemd Cassidy doesn't care about Louisiana. He cares about raising his political profile and kissing the collective asses of the @GOP and Trump
909963150832701440 2017-09-18 02:11:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @JulianAssange Yeah, get the facts straight. He wasn't wiretapped. Manafort was.  You're a festering, lying boil in the butt of humanity and a rapist
909962640432046081 2017-09-18 02:09:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood Nope
909938034656690176 2017-09-18 00:31:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain @nycsouthpaw @dannyanddesi Good question. No doubt he's a war hero but does he have the political courage. He did earlier. Please say he still does
909937583790055424 2017-09-18 00:30:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @samstein @nevertrumptoo I doubt @SenJohnMcCain is a man of his word any longer. Ruined all the good he's done & will be remembered as choosing party over lives
909937013951913985 2017-09-18 00:27:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @BarbaraBoxer @FLOTUS wants to get rid of bullying to clear the field for the biggest bully of them all - her husband. She's complicit in his actions
909936691485458432 2017-09-18 00:26:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @kelsey_snell @WaPoSean @abbydphillip This bill isn't to improve healthcare for the good of the people. The majority of us don't want it. It's purely politics w/lives at risk
909936199191506945 2017-09-18 00:24:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @SenatorCollins @mmurraypolitics @frankthorp if this bill was good for the people, the @gop would be saying it LOUDLY. This process has been corrupt from start. Don't do this to us
909935555982401536 2017-09-18 00:21:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @Marmel @SenJohnMcCain knows better. Please don't do this to the millions of people who depend on Medicaid. No child should die for political points
909935166289731584 2017-09-18 00:20:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain @ThePlumLineGS I pray he isn't. McCain gave me hope after he voted down the last one that a bill this important demanded an open/bipartisan process.

909925544287887360 2017-09-18 23:42:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood Trump has made it ok to be your worst self evidently. The damage he has already done to our country is unbelievable. #impeachTrumpnow
909925278318682112 2017-09-18 23:41:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @nycsouthpaw How does @SenRandPauI has more integrity than @SenJohnMcCain? The war hero who will take away healthcare from millions? Say it ain't so
909924873010429952 2017-09-18 23:39:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @nycsouthpaw If @SenJohnMcCain is so easily appeased, his words meant nothing. All those years in the Senate & legacy will be taking away healthcare
909924621784203264 2017-09-18 23:38:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @DavidNather @SenateGOP @RogerWicker @SenThadCochran are going to vote yes to a bill without knowing the full impact on the healthcare of MS citizens.
909863953928396800 2017-09-18 19:37:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @SenThadCochran @RogerWicker are voting yes despite 38% of MS residents on Medicaid. They don't serve the people of MS just themselves/party
909863592698064896 2017-09-18 19:35:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias @HouseGOP @SenateGOP no longer serve the American people. They serves themselves, their party, corps & their reelection. Vote them all out
909863095584960512 2017-09-18 19:34:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias @SenateGOP have such contempt & distaste for us that they're rushing a bill to deprive h/c from millions despite maj of people against it
909862694785662976 2017-09-18 19:32:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP @chrislhayes @sahilkapur @Tit4tat11 And the states of the 3 no votes last time but I'm sure that's a coincidence
909862562832949248 2017-09-18 19:31:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy are rushing through a bill they know will devastate American families. When did they quit working for us?
909862014893268992 2017-09-18 19:29:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @TPM The @SenateGOP don't even try to hide their bigotry anymore under Trump. "Reds" "Yellows"?? The new @GOP everybody - racist & proud of it
909861527313727488 2017-09-18 19:27:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @WLOX @wlox @sunherald @RogerWicker @SenThadCochran If Graham-Cassidy is so good, explain/defend it in hearings not rushed thru on partisan vote
909858790622691329 2017-09-18 19:16:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP @RogerWicker @SenThadCochran are voting yes to taking health care from millions on a bill majority of Americans oppose
909857948255399936 2017-09-18 19:13:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @sahilkapur @w0bear If he votes yes, the legacy of @SenJohnMcCain will be depriving millions of healthcare (except Congress) & putting party over country
909857685260009473 2017-09-18 19:12:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @sahilkapur @Tit4tat11 @SenateGOP In the name of decency, don't deprive millions of healthcare for political purposes.
909857412697407488 2017-09-18 19:11:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @sahilkapur @Tit4tat11 @SenateGOP the majority of the American people including your constituents don't want  the ACA repealed, so who are you doing this for?
909857171323592704 2017-09-18 19:10:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @Fahrenthold @sahilkapur @sigski @SenateGOP passing this bill will ensure that people in MS who already have high numbers on Medicaid will have no chance for healthcare
909856850690007041 2017-09-18 19:09:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @maggieNYT @sahilkapur @GayleStorm2018 Please @SenJohnMcCain don't put party/friendship before the healthcare of millions. Here in MS, this bill would be a disaster
909856587799453697 2017-09-18 19:08:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @sahilkapur Means McCain is a yes
909577549281243136 2017-09-17 00:39:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @BillCassidy @brianbeutler @CitizenCohn Cassidy is putting his party before America, trying desperately to take away healthcare from his constituents and millions of Americans
909576578199199744 2017-09-17 00:35:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler @jonfavs Does @SenJohnMcCain have it in him to one more time put America before party? Or were those pretty words he spoke on the floor just words?
909575842514141185 2017-09-17 00:32:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @maggieNYT @anniekarni Funny, but let's not reward @seanspicer for repeatedly and knowingly lying to the American public
909508419601575936 2017-09-17 20:04:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @LindseyGrahamSC @brianbeutler @Nataliew1020 Graham puts party before the health of America's children and the well being of the country.
909507921037295617 2017-09-17 20:02:40 UTC <Bearnmind> It is time to have a serious conversation about the mental illness of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
909507564756279296 2017-09-17 20:01:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @stuartpstevens America is repeatedly humiliated and degraded daily by @realDonaldTrump #ImpeachTrump #cretin #karma #RacistGOP
909506459293032449 2017-09-17 19:56:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @LindseyGrahamSC will you apply this same standard to your bill? The one that deprives millions of healthcare and irrevocably devastates American families
909506108691177472 2017-09-17 19:55:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @SteveSchmidtSES The @gop can never credibly talk about family values, morals, character or ethics. Not to mention racism, violence against women, decency...
909504714517049349 2017-09-17 19:49:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Trump exposed how morally corrupt, cynical & cowardly the @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr actually are. #VoteThemOut
908907281068068864 2017-09-15 04:15:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @USATODAY @gregorykorte @BrendanNyhan @POTUSProf @realDonaldTrump will do anything to avoid condemning a significant portion of his base. This is easy - white supremacists =
908878023880933376 2017-09-15 02:19:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP I pray @lisamurkowski and Collins stand their ground and protect millions from losing healthcare. I think @SenJohnMcCain will vote yes
908739691188330498 2017-09-15 17:10:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @samstein Once again @LindseyGrahamSC and the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP are trying to take away healthcare from millions. They are heartless and cruel
908715672351285248 2017-09-15 15:34:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @AMLwhere I wonder what he'd say about the South today. Seems like any progress made has been wiped out by Trump's election
908713311314702336 2017-09-15 15:25:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @eorlins I'm a Senior Advisor for a government agency and I am calling Trump a White Supremacist
908712221336670214 2017-09-15 15:20:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @SykesCharlie This sounds completely in character for Lewandowski.
908549888350216192 2017-09-14 04:35:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @slpng_giants Given his history of punching women, I don't give a shit about anything that comes out of Mayweather's mouth. He's despicable
908548523934617600 2017-09-14 04:30:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter Guess he missed the news last week
908546423272046593 2017-09-14 04:22:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins I never believed @op was a racist party until I saw how they treated Obama & the knots they've twisted themselves in to justify Trump

908425528998338561 2017-09-14 20:21:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @SarahHuckabee @PeteDominick @ErickFernandez Appreciate the reminder on why I despise @FoxNews & confirming my opinion that Fox and this current iteration of the @GOP are racist bigots
908424321386852352 2017-09-14 20:16:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm @TPM Wow, just wow. I knew Trump's supporters were "different" but this is cult behavior
908423868301414405 2017-09-14 20:15:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @DavidMastio @SykesCharlie @JRubinBlogger If Trump's base had to admit they were wrong and that they threw America under the bus by electing him, their heads would explode

908413223422095360 2017-09-14 19:32:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm I thought it was a joke when I read what Trump said
908384009771786241 2017-09-14 17:36:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins @daredevil_john That's not fair to Cersei. For all her evil, she was at least intelligent
908383695853191168 2017-09-14 17:35:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins Seems a lot like poor @AnnCoulter is trying to justify why she and the other Trumpkins threw America under the bus.
908383157757648898 2017-09-14 17:33:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonfavs @IvankaTrump is useless. Her brand is damaged beyond repair. Hope sales to the 35% of Trumpeteers is enough to keep her company afloat
908186935113523201 2017-09-13 04:33:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @slpng_giants Reading the Breitbart story is eye-opening. So many dog whistles - "Immigration patriot"?

908174252339277824 2017-09-13 03:43:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @AriBerman Not even attempting to hide the fact that minority vote suppression is the goal of this "commission". Call it what is - a racist commission

908076890006716417 2017-09-13 21:16:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP Just the thought of Cruz and sexual toys. - 
908076111552282624 2017-09-13 21:13:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro @tedcruz is so desperate for attention, he'll keep anything going, no matter how stupid, to get publicity
908073043192418309 2017-09-13 21:00:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @classiclib3ral He called her a young man. I think she summed up most people's view of @infowars
908072453058023426 2017-09-13 20:58:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @mj_lee @betsy_klein Yes but do they talk back to @tedcruz
908071861904429063 2017-09-13 20:56:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @TheLeadCNN And the GOP cares nothing about sex
908071672070242304 2017-09-13 20:55:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN Yet they vote which in part explains how we ended up with Trump
908070984988721152 2017-09-13 20:52:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP Given how the GOP tried desperately to take away the health care of millions of Americans, I'll wait for an independent assessment

907709980723367936 2017-09-12 20:58:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonfavs Cruz has a conscience? Who knew?
907709835793362944 2017-09-12 20:57:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @JakeSherman Well there's the real reality and there's Trump and the Republicans' reality and never the two will meet

907704630884405252 2017-09-12 20:37:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol Says a lot about the state of things when you try to type brave and my iPhone autocorrects to "brace". Has Trump killed bravery?

904428594440613888 2017-09-03 19:39:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins A cop who abuses his power this way & has no self-control is damaging to cops everywhere and a danger to society. He needs to be prosecuted

898736306032869378 2017-08-18 02:40:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @cobbpolice1 @ScottNevins @ShaunKing He clearly committed assault. The @CvilleCityHall police should arrest and try him.
898735818101071872 2017-08-18 02:38:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @BenSasse I agree with a lot of what he says but I don't foresee the @GOP holding Trump accountable. I, like most Americans, have no faith in Congress

898632270419865601 2017-08-18 19:46:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @tribelaw Denouncing Trump's support of white supremacists/neo nazis/racism should be a bipartisan no-brained for @HouseGOP
898631052092219392 2017-08-18 19:41:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @BrandyLJensen keep confederate statues but label them treasonous & put statues of human beings being tortured next to them. That would provide context

898602776321830912 2017-08-18 17:49:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins It's one thing when you can pretend you don't know Trump's views and another when he publicly states them I guess. Can't pretend anymore
898600449539940352 2017-08-18 17:40:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @JakeSherman Will @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP finally find their spines and put country first by supporting censure? I'd be shocked if they do #cowards
898599132884905984 2017-08-18 17:35:03 UTC <Bearnmind> Truly disappointed in John Kelly. I hoped honor, integrity & love of country would have forced him to resign rather than work for a racist
898598666482573312 2017-08-18 17:33:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @PhilipRucker @PeterAlexander The White House staffers who didn't have the integrity to resign after Trump's support of racism must dread Fridays. They're all cowards
898598031137755139 2017-08-18 17:30:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger If we could just get rid of racist @realDonaldTrump and spineless but always complicit @MikePenceVP History will excoriate them both

898388651213770752 2017-08-17 03:38:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @GeraldoRivera @stuartpstevens You'd think he'd eventually get tired of publicly humiliating himself. I guess his desperation to try to be relevant trumps his pride
898388226238558208 2017-08-17 03:36:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @kylegriffin1 For the 1st time I'm impressed by one of the Murdochs. If only he felt as strongly about protecting the right of all people to vote
898387529564606464 2017-08-17 03:34:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @SenateMajLdr will pay a price in history. He will be remembered as an obstructionist who destroyed the Senate b/c we had a black POTUS
898386648328802304 2017-08-17 03:30:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @NerdyWonka What a petty, little bigot Trump is
898386234506174465 2017-08-17 03:29:04 UTC <Bearnmind> Um @realDonaldTrump forgets which lies he's told, which stands he's taken. He is mentally & morally unfit. #ImpeachTrumpNowhttps://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/898355763353198592
898385966381006848 2017-08-17 03:28:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins @realDonaldTrump will realize he won't be  remembered as a successful business man w/big personality but as a bigoted failed POTUS #Legacy
898346411594465281 2017-08-17 00:50:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN There is no what if.  He inherited money, he created an alternate reality with people only too happy to play along for money

898299085744111616 2017-08-17 21:42:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @sunherald @SunHerald @WLOX weird how @SenThadCochran @RogerWicker @StevenPalazzo & other MS US House members have been silent on #Charolettesville
898298004276338688 2017-08-17 21:38:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump But you can't condemn domestic terrorism in Charlottesville
898218202337079296 2017-08-17 16:21:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Maybe a statue showing slaves being tortured should accompany every confederate statue. That would provide context as to who these men were
898217337509351425 2017-08-17 16:17:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmfa @newtgingrich the statues were erected to intimidate African Americans during the Jim Crowe era. You're so full of racist BS
898216818199977984 2017-08-17 16:15:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @washingtonpost It says a lot about the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @gop itself that their reaction to white supremacists/nazis/murder is based on polls #cowards
898206255394717698 2017-08-17 15:33:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Not a lot of diversity here

897995299733594112 2017-08-16 01:35:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro And the failure of the @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP to take a stand against a racist POTUS will be a stain upon them in history
897993923917889537 2017-08-16 01:30:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @GeorgeTakei what happens when certain people didn't like having an African American POTUS. They elect a POTUS who supports white supremacy
897991889877700608 2017-08-16 01:22:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @slpng_giants I guess that's the end of My relationship with @HomeDepot and the start of my relationship with @Lowes
897934404454100992 2017-08-16 21:33:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @LindseyGrahamSC @ScottNevins Your words are meaningless without action. Can't you find any portion of your spine, denounce Trump & stand up for this country?
897933019884933120 2017-08-16 21:28:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP Given how often Trump declared bankruptcy, its's just a matter of time before the country goes fiscally bankrupt.
897931671508574208 2017-08-16 21:22:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnKasich @samstein @WillieGeist There's a growing sense of moral imperative to impeach him
897931339122458624 2017-08-16 21:21:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeed I saw this earlier. This is an abuse of power. Both of these cops should be charged with rape and sexual assault.
897931073656471552 2017-08-16 21:20:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @stuartpstevens @GeraldoRivera I know you can't help yourself but please spare the rest of us. No one cares what you think or say
897930081472880642 2017-08-16 21:16:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum And who pays the price?  All Americans even though the majority of us didn't vote for him
897929852182970368 2017-08-16 21:15:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins Crying over being held accountable for your action, what a shiner.
897929535814893569 2017-08-16 21:14:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins Not such a big and bad man without a gun or stick in his hands trying to hurt people protesting against his racism. Zero sympathy
897894840146378752 2017-08-16 18:56:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoshuaWSharpe @davidjoachim @distinrece They should call their bestest buddies  @realDonaldTrump @MikePenceVP They not only get them a permit, they'd bring the marshmallows
897893725254426624 2017-08-16 18:52:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @PatTiberi Saying all the right things is meaningless if you don't back it up with action. Are you a coward or a leader? Guess we'll find out
897893320004915216 2017-08-16 18:50:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan You lie almost as well as Trump. You're giving a tax cut to the wealthy. You have shown you care nothing about the rest of us #2018midterms
897893040966299648 2017-08-16 18:49:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @HarrySteinDC What's bigotry/racism/destruction what we stand for to @SpeakerRyan if the trade off is giving a tax cut to the wealthy? #votehimout
897892555177775120 2017-08-16 18:47:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @mtaibbi But happy to work with racist @realDonaldTrump
897892186204852224 2017-08-16 18:45:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @politico Since the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP have supported Trump in his lies. It's safe to say this "outrage" is 90% political calculation & 10% truth
897891815919112193 2017-08-16 18:44:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol This is who @realDonaldTrump @MikePenceVP & every @HouseGOP @SenateGOP support by not taking action against a racist POTUS and VPOTUS
897891487832256513 2017-08-16 18:43:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @shearm @maggieNYT Proving yet again that @jaredkushner and @IvankaTrump are cowards & hypocrites. No surprise there
897890951972126721 2017-08-16 18:40:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins @MikePenceVP is the worst kind of coward. He's on whatever side of racism helps him the most politically. We deserve so much better than him
897890459477037057 2017-08-16 18:39:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @PhilipRucker Not taking a stand to avoid damaging his hopes to be POTUS. By doing that @MikePenceVP has chosen to support white supremacists/nazis
897890169570947073 2017-08-16 18:37:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Wonder if we'll ever have a @HouseGOP @SenateGOP where integrity and courage are more prevalent than cowardice.
897889137012953099 2017-08-16 18:33:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedNews So @MikePenceVP supports white supremacists and Nazis & people who fight against racism are bad. Good to know. He's as despicable as Trump
897888204266889220 2017-08-16 18:30:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @slpng_giants She's desperate
897888019449094144 2017-08-16 18:29:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire How these people can live with themselves is beyond me. I guess proximity to power is worth their souls to these people. #wrongsideofhistory
897887743652581388 2017-08-16 18:28:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP I can't imagine who would have doctored that photo...hmmm, my guess is one of Trump's cult
897887381767979009 2017-08-16 18:26:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @TPM @SenateMajLdr that's all you got? Refusing to denounce Trump for his racist views is just too hard?  Always party before country #midterms
897886979760771076 2017-08-16 18:25:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @TPM The cowardice of the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP never ceases to amaze me. Equating white supremacists & nazis w/people protesting racism.
897885916852891649 2017-08-16 18:20:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @JerryFalwellJr You're a disgrace. Proud of Trump?  Refusing to Condemn racism, bigotry, white supremacists and Nazis is what you're proud of?
897885428044451844 2017-08-16 18:19:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins Happy to know I can buy @CampbellSoupCo soups again. I donated all mine to the local food bank when the CEO didn't resign immediately
897857359149772801 2017-08-16 16:27:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @MichaelCohen212 It makes you a coward
897833722212478976 2017-08-16 14:53:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller The fact that @MikePenceVP hasn't denounced Trump means he holds the same views.
897830681543417856 2017-08-16 14:41:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel I'm sure Trump is shaking in his shoes about that. What's more upsetting is @SenateMajLdr lacks the courage to denounce Trump & his racism
897829497030008832 2017-08-16 14:36:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @MichaelCohen212 because you have some pictures with African Americans but haven't repudiated Trump means you're complicit in saying racism is acceptable
897828994707595264 2017-08-16 14:34:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum The @HouseGOP @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr decided racism/bigotry/violence are less important than their agenda. Complicit cowards
897661893678178304 2017-08-15 03:30:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum That there's even a doubt says a lot about what we're in danger of becoming
897661287789981696 2017-08-15 03:28:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @Wonkblog @jonfavs @LHSummers Any CEO that doesn't resign is complicit. People should take matters in their own hands and boycott those companies
897659695749636097 2017-08-15 03:22:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @PaulBegala @brianefallon How long he stays silent and doesn't resign will tell us who John Kelly really is. I pray his integrity, character and love of country wil
897657474844676102 2017-08-15 03:13:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @GlennThrush @maggieNYT @shearm anyone who thought it couldn't happen here, think again. It's happening now led by @realDonaldTrump
897656067777335298 2017-08-15 03:07:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @JerryMoran Just words if you don't back it up with action. It's no ok to denounce his words but do nothing. Put your country before your party for once
897655530486890499 2017-08-15 03:05:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter Yet, somehow @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP @SenateGOP will find a way. Always party over country. The @GOP has no soul anymore
897655258196922369 2017-08-15 03:04:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @oliverdarcy is outright racism/bigotry a bridge too far for @FoxNews? Judging by tonight, nope. Just a few commentators who found a sliver of integrity
897654924972109825 2017-08-15 03:03:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood I don't think he knows or cares that there is a difference. He is damaging this country irrevocably. He is mentally & morally unfit
897654553990103040 2017-08-15 03:01:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP_Politics I was born in Alabama but their politics embarrass me. There has to be a @GOP politician in AL that isn't a bigot or nut job.
897654039697076224 2017-08-15 02:59:35 UTC <Bearnmind> Any @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP members words who don't denounce Trump publicly mean nothing. They're giving a wink/nod to racism/bigotryhttps://twitter.com/huffpostpol/status/897649395071676416
897653382588096512 2017-08-15 02:56:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @UVA @sivavaid Trump's very fine people are vile, vicious thugs.  I'm so sorry this happened to your friend. I am praying for his recovery.
897652587872366593 2017-08-15 02:53:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP John Kelly is not a savior. If he doesn't resign, he's sold out his integrity, character, honor & most importantly, his country
897652085403025408 2017-08-15 02:51:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidfrum What's so terrifying is that Trump thinks he crushed it. I have serious concerns about his mental fitness for duty.
897651830318149633 2017-08-15 02:50:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @POTUS @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Defending the indefensible. They clearly put themselves before the country. They are a disgrace

897160152004120576 2017-08-14 18:17:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @slpng_giants @Lawrence Ironic Trump's first pardon would be to a racist
897121374602502145 2017-08-14 15:42:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @UnderArmour Prove it. Stand up for what you say you believe & resign from the council. Otherwise your words are meaningless
897118211115823104 2017-08-14 15:30:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS weak and impotent - an apt description of Trump. I would also add racist, liar, bigot, misogynist & xenophobehttps://twitter.com/nydailynews/status/897090563853438977

897072091522113536 2017-08-14 12:27:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @KevinHart4real I raised my daughter to understand that the color of someone's skin is no more important than the color of someone's eyes or hair

896925449518948352 2017-08-13 02:44:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @PhilipRucker Except when @MikePenceVP is trying to get elected. Then he finds tolerance. Pence is as complicit as Trump.
896925122505752576 2017-08-13 02:43:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @maggieNYT If it had been African Americans demonstrating the police would have had riot gear on. Racism in this country is systemic
896924719684898817 2017-08-13 02:41:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum self-preservation will cause @FoxNews to turn on Trump. Lord knows decency, integrity, morals, or love of country won't do it.

896794097662537728 2017-08-13 18:02:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @RalstonReports To be fair, the @GOP started the guilt by association with no context allowed with Obama
896574644500791296 2017-08-12 03:30:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood And the majority of them will choose "wrong0 because it's politically better and none of us will be surprised

896507118597144578 2017-08-12 23:02:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @StevenTDennis @realDonaldTrump As long as you don't have to condemn your white supremacy supporters. What a coward you are

896504892315103232 2017-08-12 22:53:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @dougmckelway @brianstelter As opposed to pardon his racism? @FoxNews is complicit in what happened today
896504714593828864 2017-08-12 22:52:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @slpng_giants @JeffBezos  Pls stop supporting hatred/racism w/your ads. As a decades long customer, I can't continue to support @amazon if it continues
896469820748611584 2017-08-12 20:33:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedNews Coming from a racist like @jeffsessions @attorneygeneral those words mean nothing.
896464731711713284 2017-08-12 20:13:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @JonLemire As usual he takes the cowardly way out. Doesn't want to offend the part of his base that are white supremacists

895829791907164160 2017-08-10 02:10:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @ScottNevins Since Trump insists that the majority of the military voted for them, he'd be willing to sacrifice the lives of supporters for his ego
895829562067759105 2017-08-10 02:09:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins That just the thought of this didn't cause an uproar shows how little @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP and @realDonaldTrump value life.
895829055702016001 2017-08-10 02:07:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins And can I just say "ewww" to anyone finding Jason Miller attractive.

895451986694250496 2017-08-09 01:09:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @paulkrugman Only in Alabama would they elected a man found unfit to be a judge to go to Congress to "legislate"
895450788327288832 2017-08-09 01:04:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @RyanLizza @StevenTDennis @Scaramucci Scaramucci & Anthony Weiner have a lot in common. They both can't stop humiliating themselves publicly.

895263652873469953 2017-08-09 12:41:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump You shd let the House Armed Svc Committee know you can warp time.  In March 2017 they said it would take $1 Trillion & 30 years to do this
895259771246346242 2017-08-09 12:25:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump That didn't happen in 200 days and the fact that you think it did shows just how little you know about the nuclear arsenal. Scary
895078130561368064 2017-08-08 00:23:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @OliviaMesser @CNN always overreacts. They just want to use their toys. A 3D model of North Korea is next

894999321321623552 2017-08-08 19:10:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump About 11% of the population of the US follows you; over 25% of the population follows @BarackObama. Just saying....
894998554938413056 2017-08-08 19:07:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Imagine if everyone who detests Trump unfollowed him. His numbers would decrease by millions & it would make him crazy
894998167623786499 2017-08-08 19:06:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump For once you're telling the truth, no admin in history has achieved this level of incompetence and lies in 200 days. Quite the legacy

894983100387733504 2017-08-08 18:06:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler @RonaldKlain Equivalent of the Twinkie defense. @jaredkushner and @realDonaldTrump knew exactly what they were doing.  How is collusion not treason?

891140244329910274 2017-07-28 03:36:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @Reince is a glutton for public humiliation and degradation. He deserves it.

891125739965251586 2017-07-28 02:38:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @MikeGrunwald Let's not forget @LindseyGrahamSC voted yes to a bill he said was a disaster knowing it could be passed by House & devastate millions
891125334514556928 2017-07-28 02:36:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm @JasminMuj it's not because @Scaramucci  is civic minded. He's just using his position in WH to get his $90 mil from Sky Bridge sale to China
891124875393421312 2017-07-28 02:35:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @maggieNYT @FoxNews How pathetic is @Reince always putting party over his country.

890899240381288448 2017-07-28 11:38:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @emmaroller This is great. The fact that there wasn't pro-skinny repeal groups protesting should have been a warning to @SenateGOP Activism works
890895924591030272 2017-07-28 11:25:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain @rachaelmbade @SenateDems please no spiking the football. Work with Republicans to find bipartisan solutions to fix the AC so everyone wins

890893057574526976 2017-07-28 11:13:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump I think you meant to say that 3 courageous Republicans cared more about access to healthcare than passing a bad bill
890762005031903232 2017-07-27 02:33:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @RalstonReports We can finally put to bed the myth that @SenJohnMcCain is a "maverick". He's just another coward throwing American people under the bus

890741366514483200 2017-07-27 01:11:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @justinsink Based on what he said, it's clear this is a personal vendetta by @Scaramucci against Bannon & Priebus for stopping his appt earlier
890740623816486913 2017-07-27 01:08:08 UTC <Bearnmind> Does anyone else think that @seanhannity licked Trump's hands clean after dinner. Makes sense since he was already on his knees
890737842032390144 2017-07-27 00:57:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain has a chance to fix this. Does he have the courage anymore to stand up for the people?  We'll see.https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/john-mccain-makes-his-choice/534972/

890737013967683584 2017-07-27 00:53:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @HarrySteinDC Watching the @SenateGOP destroy the Senate is painful. Their legacy will be destroying one of the most important institutions in gov.
890736017824763904 2017-07-27 00:49:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @Scaramucci Yet you chastised people for years on your twitter feed for using bad language. That makes you a hypocrite so you fit right in
890735440151687170 2017-07-27 00:47:32 UTC <Bearnmind> Yet @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain don't understand they can stop this by just voting no and returning to regular order. they're cowardshttps://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/890684732345917440

890731967297277952 2017-07-27 00:33:44 UTC <Bearnmind> If the @SenateGOP think @SpeakerRyan won't cave and vote the skinny bill into law, they're dumber than we already know they Are #hypocriteshttps://twitter.com/mj_lee/status/890717126042038272
890731696416575488 2017-07-27 00:32:40 UTC <Bearnmind> Seems @Scaramucci forgot his own advice. Do as I say not as I dohttps://twitter.com/scaramucci/status/802738350851555328

890648559187447808 2017-07-27 19:02:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol What do they know? They only run health insurance. The @SenateGOP is full of healthcare experts - they can even pass a bill w/o reading it
890648161844207616 2017-07-27 19:00:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins @YAppelbaum Having to apologize for a speech by a President. Wow. Maybe Trump was trying to indoctrinate them young. Wonder who else did that in 1930s

890646680235790336 2017-07-27 18:54:50 UTC <Bearnmind> when it does and their constituents (a lot of red states) lose healthcare & premiums go up, they don't have to worry - they're EXEMPThttps://twitter.com/mattwhouse/status/890632759844020224
890646020412985345 2017-07-27 18:52:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes And all the @SenateGOP will be shocked when it becomes law & they have to explain they were duped to their supporters are premiums go up
890645747091230721 2017-07-27 18:51:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @StevenTDennis At @SenateGOP are always "concerned"; their action and votes prove that concern is all for show. They exempted themselves - that says it all
890644739904610304 2017-07-27 18:47:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @AliceOllstein Yet even knowing that, @SenRonJohnson will vote yes. It takes courage to stand up for the people. He's all party before country
890644244058320899 2017-07-27 18:45:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @mj_lee @LindseyGrahamSC is trying to rationalize his vote to take away healthcare from millions. Just another coward who talks a big game
890643951174115329 2017-07-27 18:43:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @amyfiscus @Scaramucci you're so right. Every action Trump has taken & every tweet shows he's terrified of what Mueller will discover.
890642353475551232 2017-07-27 18:37:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @MEPFuller So @SenSusanCollins is caving then?  I'm so disappointed. I truly thought she actually cared about access to healthcare. #partybeforecountry
890584266706493440 2017-07-27 14:46:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain is a brave war hero and rightly deserves recognition but he's a political coward & hypocrite as proven by his voteshttps://twitter.com/1bobcohn/status/890576898987786240
890583876116107264 2017-07-27 14:45:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain Have to say I agree with every word. The "maverick" is a myth debunked by your voteshttps://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2017/07/a-long-time-senate-staffer-on-john-mccain/535050/

890581015038701568 2017-07-27 14:33:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @mkraju @LindseyGrahamSC @joshrogin But Graham is enthusiastically helping him destroy our democracy &  take healthcare away from millions. All Graham cares about is airtime
890566495809482752 2017-07-27 13:36:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @samstein Seriously can't you just picture @Scaramucci in front of the mirror every day doing the Fonzie thing from Happy Days?

890561416402538497 2017-07-27 13:16:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @sunherald I'm sure every 60 yro in MS has an extra $1800 for premium increases under "skinny repeal" except @SenThadCochran - he's exempt
890559476520112128 2017-07-27 13:08:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP could be heroes & return to regular order & work w/Dems to end this destructive partisanship but they don't have the courage
890558669691244544 2017-07-27 13:05:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain @jonfavs @neeratanden At some point we have to let go of the old "maverick" McCain. That McCain is long gone. He hasn't put his country before his party in years
890557831308599299 2017-07-27 13:01:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics Imagine if Obama had done or said just one of the things Trump has. The @GOP would have had a collective stroke trying to impeach him
890557511249657857 2017-07-27 13:00:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @TopherSpiro Now we all get to see if @SenJohnMcCain has any maverick/ability to put country over party left in him. I expect to be disappointed in him
890556702503862276 2017-07-27 12:57:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonathanchait Harvard has to be embarrassed about @Scaramucci He's a Harvard grad but can't understand the law
890555867623542785 2017-07-27 12:53:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @nycsouthpaw Scary that the Justice Department under @jeffsessions doesn't even know the laws they're supposed to enforce.
890555476739489792 2017-07-27 12:52:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @Scaramucci @JohnJHarwood @danmericaCNN How sad that the greatest threat to our freedom/democracy is the POTUS. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP care more about their party than their country
890554119303426048 2017-07-27 12:47:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @Scaramucci @JohnJHarwood @danmericaCNN Majority of the country:  Thank you Jesus
890553958128898050 2017-07-27 12:46:23 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey @Scaramucci here's your treasonous leakerhttps://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/890552108474408962
890553744424927233 2017-07-27 12:45:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics @nickconfessore You just know that @Scaramucci gave himself the nickname "The Mooch" cause he thought it'd make him cool. He should be called "The Filch"
890552525002244096 2017-07-27 12:40:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics @nickconfessore Zero sympathy for @Reince getting attacked by slimy @Scaramucci. Priebus sold out his country for Trump. Let them tear each other apart
890551887250022401 2017-07-27 12:38:10 UTC <Bearnmind> FYI just because @BillCassidy is a doctor doesn't mean he cares about access to healthcare. He cares about reelection & #partyovercountry
890551503416684544 2017-07-27 12:36:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @maggieNYT More of @Scaramucci talking about himself. Has he met Trump's ego?
890551233173483520 2017-07-27 12:35:34 UTC <Bearnmind> Watching @BillCassidy twist himself into knots on @MSNBC trying to defend his hypocrisy on healthcare. We deserve so much better #votehimOUT
890550806289813509 2017-07-27 12:33:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @igorbobic Shocking that @BillCassidy is a hypocrite & voting the party line. Only 2 senators actually care about access to healthcare for people
890550249684652033 2017-07-27 12:31:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @OliviaMesser But collusion with a hostile foreign power to influence our elections is fine. @Scaramucci proving that hypocrisy is a job requirement
890548902927241218 2017-07-27 12:26:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @Scaramucci talks about himself more than he talks about Trump. Trump's ego isn't going to tolerate that for long

890250924219932675 2017-07-26 16:42:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @sunherald given @SenThadCochran @RogerWicker support of Trumpcare, are they going to offer an amendment to strip away their exemption?

890242900197609474 2017-07-26 16:10:21 UTC <Bearnmind> And I'm sure @SenJohnMcCain will give another speech on the floor about why it's wrong right before he votes yes to ithttps://twitter.com/samstein/status/890237475771338752

890145663157243904 2017-07-26 09:43:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias What makes @SenJohnMcCain yes vote the worst is that he's accessing healthcare now but voting to take that ability from millions
890145428561440769 2017-07-26 09:43:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias Why is anyone surprised that @SenJohnMcCain  lied and voted yes? He's not a "maverick" he's just another lying Republican Senator

889827452079542273 2017-07-25 12:39:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler And Trump is the one leaking classified information.

889826639953223680 2017-07-25 12:36:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @kygov KY has benefited more per capita from Obamacare than any other state. @SenateMajLdr is trying to take that away & hurt KY families

889691039765864448 2017-07-24 03:37:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @StuPolitics The sad thing is that even though Trump's cult supporters have bought from Amazon & paid sales tax, they'll still believe this to be true

889490299562676228 2017-07-24 14:19:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump you collided with Russia, an foreign advisory on the election, you're illegitimate. Doesnt that make you a traitor as well?
889489609146728449 2017-07-24 14:17:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump The POTUS spends his time attacking people on twitter instead of doing his job.
889476241207824386 2017-07-24 13:23:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenThadCochran @RogerWicker - why are you voting yes to strip Medicaid from 38% of Mississippi citizens? You work for us remember?
889475867361062912 2017-07-24 13:22:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias I live in Mississippi and we routinely vote against our best interests here. No 7 on top 10 worst states and #2 in total people on Medicaid

889474095347269633 2017-07-24 13:15:24 UTC <Bearnmind> One would hope @DeanHeller @SenCapito have courage/best interest of people & vote no to MTP & find bipartisan fix. One will be disappointed
889472528154054657 2017-07-24 13:09:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @POTUS @KellyannePolls You're a vile, petty woman. You sacrificed integrity, morals & character to be a public laughingstock and known liar.

889471296437977088 2017-07-24 13:04:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN And he still has important work to do like taking away civil rights and the ability to vote. He deserves every humiliation heaped on him
889471108151377921 2017-07-24 13:03:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN Because he will have sacrificed whatever integrity (as a racist he didn't have much) & Senate seat for nothing if he resigns

886743876274356225 2017-07-16 00:26:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonlovett Don't forget the voters, ignore them too. What's the worst that could happen? You'll lose the house in 2018 & the Senate in 2020
886743563618353153 2017-07-16 00:25:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS BTW, Obama still has higher approval ratings & respect/admiration of the US & the world. You'll never measure up
886743184516296705 2017-07-16 00:23:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You'll always be the POTUS Russia elected. History will remember you  as the POTUS w/worst ever approval ratings
886742661243310081 2017-07-16 00:21:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS you'll never get the respect and love you so desperately crave from the media again. the President with an "*"
886742334322479105 2017-07-16 00:20:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS you'll always be known as a terrible President that the majority of country & world dislike?
886742083301761030 2017-07-16 00:19:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has it dawned on you yet that you'll never recover your reputation & that your legacy will be failure?
886741217127669765 2017-07-16 00:15:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenThadCochran @RogerWicker voting yes to Trumpcare/thousands in MS losing healthcare & Medicaid but exempting themselves & their families
886638919055486978 2017-07-16 17:29:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnCornyn @seungminkim Or as a result of @SenateGOP @HouseGOP blatantly lying & serving only themselves and not the people #VoteThemOut #TermLimits
886638435137728512 2017-07-16 17:27:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @ThisWeekABC @SenatorCollins @ABCPolitics Only 1 @SenateGOP out of 52 cares about the health of American people. Only 1. Congress is useless. We need #TermLimits now
886637938557190144 2017-07-16 17:25:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler Up until Russia help elects a Democrat and then the @SenateGOP @HouseGOP will yelp about the danger to our democracy. Hypocrites
886636470894813184 2017-07-16 17:19:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @Delta @AnnCoulter Stop playing the victim.
886635638929461248 2017-07-16 17:16:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @Acosta They fear the media discovering the truth so much they will do their best to destroy it, consequences to our democracy be damned
886635370439475202 2017-07-16 17:15:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @VP For the 1st time in my life (and I was a Republican for 25 yrs) I have no respect for the President or Vice President. They're both liars
886635065970655238 2017-07-16 17:14:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @VP You're flat out lying. You sold any morals, integrity & honesty you may have had. Why do you hate the American people so much?
886634711656824832 2017-07-16 17:12:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @poniewozik @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is deliberately representing only 36% of the country. He has done the impossible & divided us even further purposely
886634244717588480 2017-07-16 17:10:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @MariaBartiromo @SecPriceMD @FoxNews Price is blatantly lying to the American people. If Trumpcare is so great, why did Congress exempt themselves and their families from it?
886633663533854720 2017-07-16 17:08:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS How'd you like the polls showing you have the worst 6 month approval rating in over 70 years. You're only going to go lower
886633357257396224 2017-07-16 17:07:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Whereas you're doing your best to destroy our democracy & make money doing it. You're an illegitimate POTUS & a horrible one to boot
886383165253791744 2017-07-15 00:33:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Poor thing, it must be hard for that massive ego to know that no one likes you but everyone liked @POTUS44https://twitter.com/philiprucker/status/886376407420608513

885893200271081472 2017-07-14 16:06:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @EWErickson You just don't want to believe the truth - yes Junior is that stupid and yes Trump colluded with Russia to meddle in the election
885892816957788161 2017-07-14 16:04:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @KellyannePolls It cuts Medicaid to the poor, disabled, seniors and children you heartless, lying crone. Go away, far far away
885680674962890752 2017-07-13 02:01:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias It would be so much easier to just report when Trump tells the truth
885680478229061632 2017-07-13 02:00:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @USSenate @jonfavs @SenatorCollins A rarity in the @ussenate - a show of courage and concern for constituents
885678166186110977 2017-07-13 01:51:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @hughhewitt By passing a bill that 88% of Americans (all parties) don't want and exempting themselves - Congress shows they no longer serve the people
885677809393442816 2017-07-13 01:50:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @RepJoeKennedy @SenateGOP @HouseGOP forcing a bill that 88% of Americans don't want. If it's so great, why is Congress exempt from Trumpcare?
885677396145451008 2017-07-13 01:48:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @philipaklein @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP are no longer patriots. They're ok with Trump colliding with Russia to meddle in our elections?!? Traitorous
885676772330745856 2017-07-13 01:46:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC @foxnews if Trumpcare is so great, why has @SenateGOP @HouseGOP exempted themselves from it? Self-serving cowards
885676341143769090 2017-07-13 01:44:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes Hopefully they'll pay for it in the #2018midterms. The only ones who want this bill are the Senators who are exempt
885676050390196225 2017-07-13 01:43:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonfavs Of course they'll cave. They're passing a bill only 12% of voters want. They're all cowards serving only themselves
885675437011206144 2017-07-13 01:40:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @Isikoff @BraddJaffy He knew about it when it happened. @DonaldJTrumpJr doesn't go to the bathroom without daddy's permission. They're all liars
885622474024640512 2017-07-13 22:10:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy Is anyone surprised that Trump has a thug for a lawyer

885593879382294528 2017-07-13 20:16:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins Well they had to do something with all those Republican soccer mom Barbie prototypes
885549378546663424 2017-07-13 17:19:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Well man might be a stretch
885501054825238528 2017-07-13 14:07:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidfrum Who hasn't forgotten a 100 people and numerous meetings?
885500512241672193 2017-07-13 14:05:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidfrum @lrozen So @jeffsessions is either a liar (we already know he's a racist bigot) or he has dementia
885444561333608448 2017-07-13 10:23:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @ScottNevins I'm beginning to wonder if @KellyannePolls is actually a real person or a caricature come to life.
885342267845857280 2017-07-12 03:37:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @PeterBeinart @brhodes I didn't think it was possible for @KellyannePolls to debase herself further. I was wrong. But what contempt she has for @FoxNews viewers
885327649253367808 2017-07-12 02:38:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonathanchait @TopherSpiro @marcorubio is still smarting from his catastrophic POTUS bid so he'll stick to the American people & vote yes. It takes a spine to vote no
885326939027845120 2017-07-12 02:36:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio If you care at all about your constituents, vote no
885297642393268224 2017-07-12 00:39:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump This from a man so desperate for press that he pretended to be someone else to tout his sexual exploits to the press.
885296781776564224 2017-07-12 00:36:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @SebGorka @andersoncooper @oliverdarcy @johnbro08670931 Except when it comes to accepting their assessment Russia meddled in our election.  Quite the hypocrisy and contradiction.
885296357170442240 2017-07-12 00:34:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @SebGorka @oliverdarcy It was hard to watch. @andersoncooper allowed himself to be rolled
885296154258354176 2017-07-12 00:33:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @PaulBegala @peterdaou And they're both equally arrogant and repulsive
885296073308348416 2017-07-12 00:33:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @SebGorka @andersoncooper @brianstelter @AC360 Seriously? you still let him avoid and evade answering your questions. Either you got distracted by his insults or you just whiffed
885295687050645504 2017-07-12 00:31:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @andersoncooper why did you let @SebGorka evade your questions?  That man's arrogance is completely unfounded and off-putting.
885291210662973441 2017-07-12 00:14:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenThadCochran @RogerWicker Why are voting yes on Trumpcare & to cut Medicaid with MS having one of the highest rates of people on Medicaid
885286648208125952 2017-07-12 23:55:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood Yep, every single member of @realDonaldTrump family would have held that meeting. Which means they're all willing to sell out our democracy
885286144166039552 2017-07-12 23:53:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnCornyn And still you do nothing about it. You do however apologize and try to normalize Trump's behavior. That makes you complicit & a hypocrite
885285768553476096 2017-07-12 23:52:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @pw_cunningham @eilperin @daveweigel @loriamontgomery Nobody wants this bill except the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP who are exempt from the bill, so why are they doing it? Their donors want it

885217361078439937 2017-07-12 19:20:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy I wonder if it bothers @realDonaldTrump that Putin was more scared of Clinton than he is of Trump. He knew he could outsmart Trump
885217014310215680 2017-07-12 19:19:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @ErikWemple @realSHEPsmith He's the only one with integrity @FoxNews  I wish he move to a channel that I could watch.
885216435152330752 2017-07-12 19:16:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @PeterBeinart We can have global elections for POTUS. What fun.

885166144801431553 2017-07-12 15:57:09 UTC <Bearnmind> FBI @SenateGOP confirmation hearing is a vivid reminder that these out of touch, old white men don't reflect the make-up of America today
885146152831787008 2017-07-12 14:37:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenThadCochran has been a Senator since 1978 and has no new ideas since. Can you point me to your list of accomplishment on the last 10 yrspic.twitter.com/8oxvip33AC

885145077693071360 2017-07-12 14:33:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @GOPLeader is doing a piss poor job of protecting us from Russia inference. They can't even get the sanctions bill to the floor
885144751019896832 2017-07-12 14:32:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd @jonfavs For whatever reason, we the people don't seem to believe we deserve an honest Government that serves us instead of themselves.
885144494349447168 2017-07-12 14:31:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd On the plus side, the Trump admin has proved the essential need for a free press and investigative journalism
885144338417803265 2017-07-12 14:30:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd Americans are not dumb. 70% of them will see through that. The other 30% are lost forever

885136762569453569 2017-07-12 14:00:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump This tweet is prophetic. You're grossly incompetent and will be impeached. #ImpeachTrump and his little sons too. Lol
885136305654517760 2017-07-12 13:58:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Seriously? This is the best you can come up with to justify your collusion? You're slipping. You're an illegitimate POTUS #IMPEACHMENTNOW

885076479591239682 2017-07-12 10:00:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoeNBC I've been critical of you but what you did took courage & integrity. Above all else you put your country over your party. Well done

884936539742117892 2017-07-11 00:44:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidaxelrod And we'll fail the test because @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr will always put party over country
884936016389386240 2017-07-11 00:42:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonathanchait @SenJohnMcCain has no spine and courage. He's just a water carrier for Trump. How the maverick has fallen. He cannot be forgiven for Palin
884935408093712384 2017-07-11 00:40:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonfavs @SenateMajLdr will be the example used by history to show how corrupt and self-serving our politics became. He's not an American
884934996317925382 2017-07-11 00:38:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump He loves our country?  Haha -when he found out Russia was interfering in our democratic process, he couldn't wait to help. He loves himself
884932839996878849 2017-07-11 00:30:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP are happy to support colluding, lying & treason as long as it's a Republican doing it. #partyovercountry alwayshttps://twitter.com/braddjaffy/status/884805541805129729

884930832074502144 2017-07-11 00:22:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @thedailybeast @BraddJaffy What should be a concern is that Trump knew before anyone else that Russia was trying to influence our election and said NOTHING

884863092022181889 2017-07-11 19:52:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes And as a federal employee I've seen numerous people fired for omissions or lies on an 86.
884861679082893312 2017-07-11 19:47:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler History will rightfully crucify McConnell. He cares nothing for this country.

884859410887127045 2017-07-11 19:38:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @justinamash I'd like to see less Republican hypocrisy and Republicans putting their country over their party. But that will never happen. #VoteHimOut
884858230115119104 2017-07-11 19:33:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @TPM @joshtpm He's a high quality person who collided with Russia to influence the election. He's also an idiot but that's in his genes.
884857950254313472 2017-07-11 19:32:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @MarshaBlackburn how exactly did Jr get duped? He can read can't he? The email was pretty clear. You're a hypocrite. Put your country firsthttps://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/884854559927095296
884857547567529987 2017-07-11 19:30:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes We deserve a Congress that puts country over party. These hypocrites need to be voted out. They have no new ideas & serve only themselves
884857260828241925 2017-07-11 19:29:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes Of course he knew. @DonaldJTrumpJr doesn't go the bathroom without daddy's permission.

884856548215926784 2017-07-11 19:26:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Clinton's email server was a major crime yet proven collusion by Jr, Kushner & Manafort is fine? Put your country firsthttps://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/884825718290604033

884799905948213248 2017-07-11 15:41:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @DonaldJTrumpJr @Cernovich It clearly incriminates him. You saying that it doesn't or that it's a lie is delusional
884791109465067521 2017-07-11 15:06:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy The email clearly says Russian government attorney.
884790945681743872 2017-07-11 15:06:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @JakeSherman Can he be that stupid?  The email proves he knew he was dealing with a Russian government representative
884790785253748738 2017-07-11 15:05:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @DonaldJTrumpJr And the email clearly says "Russian government attorney". Given that you can read, email shows you knew it was coming from Russian gov't.

884724168025100288 2017-07-11 10:40:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @KellyannePolls will lie about anything to keep her job. Think about it, other than Trump, who would hire her now? Her credibility is gone.
884601967628169218 2017-07-10 02:35:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @foxandfriends Dontcha just hate it when your lies become untenable and you have to tell the truth. It's such an unfamiliar thing for you to do
884601706452967424 2017-07-10 02:34:16 UTC <Bearnmind> Wonder if @realDonaldTrump will correct his lying tweet? The POTUS regularly attacks private citizens, the POTUS attacks private citizenshttps://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/884579228532043776
884590962512736256 2017-07-10 01:51:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes I imagine @DonaldJTrumpJr doesn't go to the bathroom without getting Daddy's permission. Trumps are either stupid or incredibly arrogant

884212428636119041 2017-07-09 00:47:25 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey @realDonaldTrump bet you won't be touting this poll. You're fast becoming the most disliked POTUS ever.https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2456
884098411108212736 2017-07-09 17:14:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @colbyhall And the Republican voters who have been lied to will give them a pass and re-elect them. Partisanship over their own best interests
884097513636147200 2017-07-09 17:10:47 UTC <Bearnmind> There is nothing @SenJohnMcCain can do to atone for making Trump possible by nominating Palin. His desperation damaged our democracyhttps://twitter.com/politicalwire/status/884087789163352064

883377303727812608 2017-07-07 17:28:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump I know it's difficult for your ego to accept you're not half the man Obama or even Bush was. Hell you're not even half a man
883377072609079296 2017-07-07 17:28:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump No way you're deliberately being that stupid so I have to assume you were born that way. Haven't you humiliated our country enough already?
883285061478625280 2017-07-07 11:22:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @JakeSherman Well that's the most pressing issue in the world. Why a man who didn't work at the DNC wouldn't turn over a server he had no access to
883284567465086976 2017-07-07 11:20:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @EWErickson He's on foreign soil criticizing Obama and our press. How are you ok with that?
883282317510397952 2017-07-07 11:11:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump not only do the majority of Americans not like you, but the majority of the world detests you too.

882979309165662209 2017-07-06 15:07:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd And disparaging Obama and Clinton. Putin's doing cartwheels. Trump is so getting owned
882979010266976257 2017-07-06 15:06:15 UTC <Bearnmind> It's actually quite sad. @realDonaldTrump is pathetically desperate for global adoration but receives ridicule and scorn

880814704364580866 2017-06-30 15:46:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @Hadas_Gold Well everyone knows that the National Enquirer is the gold standard of journalistic standards and integrity...hahaha
880811732444352514 2017-06-30 15:34:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire The office of the presidency has been diminished beyond repair by @realDonaldTrump   His legacy will be misogyny, bigotry and lies.
880811298057007104 2017-06-30 15:32:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoeNBC @AaronBlake @SarahHuckabee I guess these don't count. Once you've given up character, morals or ethics, what's one more lie? And you are a liar.
880810778298912768 2017-06-30 15:30:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoeNBC Sadly the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP are peachy keen with anything Trump says/does including blackmail. They're all self-serving cowards #midterms
880808192879603712 2017-06-30 15:20:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoeNBC Prove him a liar and release the records. He's crossed a dangerous line. Letting him get away with this is disastrous for our country
880807614942236673 2017-06-30 15:17:54 UTC <Bearnmind> Can @KellyannePolls be that stupid!  Free press is not state run media. It's exists to report the truth not assuage Trump's egohttps://twitter.com/zekejmiller/status/880802114687180800
880805589865123840 2017-06-30 15:09:51 UTC <Bearnmind> The National Enquirer being party to blackmail for @realDonaldTrump. I's shocked. You have to feed @realDonaldTrump ego like it's a babyhttps://twitter.com/stevenportnoy/status/880774229444222976

880763961938980864 2017-06-30 12:24:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @BenSasse You really don't care at all about the American people do you. We used to send our best to Congress. Now we send self-serving idiots
880762959173222401 2017-06-30 12:20:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNPolitics The courage @BenSasse exhibited by writing a tweet. He should have gotten on the Senate floor and demanded an apology.
880762571531399170 2017-06-30 12:18:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonfavs The stupidity of @realDonaldTrump never ceases to amaze me.
880762253510930432 2017-06-30 12:17:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @StateDept @NATO @POTUS @kaybaileyhutch I thought you had more integrity than to serve this idiot.
880626131464069121 2017-06-29 03:16:45 UTC <Bearnmind> Good to know @FLOTUS is fine with her husband attacking women. Guess her cyber bulling campaign doesn't apply to men. She's a cowardhttps://twitter.com/disavowtrump16/status/880464643466113024
880625684523122689 2017-06-29 03:14:59 UTC <Bearnmind> Um @realDonaldTrump you should look in the mirror before you criticize anyone's appearance.https://twitter.com/jacob4kids/status/880448564077314048
880583120516509696 2017-06-29 00:25:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @newtgingrich @FoxNews Well we've always known ole Newt is a misogynist. He's also an ass but that is also well known. He'll say anything to try & stay relevant
880582702235344901 2017-06-29 00:24:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews I know you call yourself a Christian but I just don't see how. You should be ashamed of yourself but clearly you have no shame left
880561452217757698 2017-06-29 22:59:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @abbydphillip @KFaulders Men with character/strength accept responsibility and apologize. @realDonaldTrump clearly has neither. Wonder who changes his diapers?
880560971114315776 2017-06-29 22:57:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @dcbigjohn @davidmackau The only truth @SarahHuckabee has uttered. She will be judged harshly. She's shown her kids that character, morals & truth don't matter
880560140142997505 2017-06-29 22:54:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @cwarzel Which is weird because no one desperately and pathetically needs attention more than the baby-in-chief @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
880559358530211840 2017-06-29 22:51:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @DanScavino You're a small, petty child who thinks name-calling makes you look strong.
880530884797112320 2017-06-29 20:58:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @TopherSpiro Can we agree that @SenateGOP @HouseGOP care nothing about the people they're supposed to serve. They care abt themselves, power and donors
880530285129084928 2017-06-29 20:55:54 UTC <Bearnmind> Wow, what courage. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr saying that wasn't very nice. Misogyny is a principle of the @GOPhttps://twitter.com/ericwolfson/status/880522668855963648
880529166537547778 2017-06-29 20:51:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @LindseyGrahamSC Wow, what courage. A tweet. Why aren't the Republicans in Congress on air demanding an apology instead of sending tweets he won't even see?
880528091449348097 2017-06-29 20:47:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @DomenicoNPR I'm am so sick of the Republican false equivalency. Two wrongs don't make a right. They do make an idiot like @SarahHuckabee
880527831712837633 2017-06-29 20:46:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @DomenicoNPR And I'm sure she says she's a Christian even while she supports bullying, racism, bigotry and misogyny
880527534663892992 2017-06-29 20:44:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm Thank goodness
880527481211506688 2017-06-29 20:44:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @samstein He's a petty, small man. His small hands correlate to proportions elsewhere. That's why @realDonaldTrump is a bully. He's compensating
880527099190292480 2017-06-29 20:43:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics @SarahHuckabee is a vile, lying woman. The example she sets for her kids -Bullying, racism & bigotry are fine as long as the POTUS is white
880525249434877952 2017-06-29 20:35:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan You really are a coward, aren't you. Had a Democrat said those things you'd be quivering with righteous indignation #uselesshttps://twitter.com/abc/status/880456188801974273

880465698618822656 2017-06-29 16:39:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenatorCollins Actually it would be helpful if you did get along considering you're supposed to represent everyone

879897021662072834 2017-06-27 02:59:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP_Politics Yet he said nothing when @FoxNews had to retract the Seth Rich story.
879896232965132290 2017-06-27 02:56:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @DylanByers @nytimes Yet @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @PressSec had nothing to say when @FoxNews was forced to retract a story.
879894999005089794 2017-06-27 02:51:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @JayCaruso That assumes that @FoxNews has journalistic standards which they clearly don't
879842680880103424 2017-06-27 23:23:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @danbalz @daveweigel What does it say about the @SenateGOP that deciding whether or not and how to devastate millions of families is all based on politics
879762511448428545 2017-06-27 18:05:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP biggest nightmare? That their voters will put country before politics and demand accountability & truth.
879761665931268097 2017-06-27 18:01:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS has made it possible for every future President to lie and still say well at least I don't lie like Trump did
879761097376632833 2017-06-27 17:59:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS no one respects you except Russia (who got you elected). You're a global joke.https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/879556950685622273

878964802374295552 2017-06-25 13:15:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenThadCochran Do lifetime limits under Trumpcare apply to Federal employees insurance & Tricare & was the congressional exemption removed?
878767939457093633 2017-06-24 00:12:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @mike_pence Can you explain to us why tax breaks for the wealthy & insurance companies are worth taking away healthcare from children & seniors?

878304026386812930 2017-06-23 17:29:32 UTC <Bearnmind> Seriously @MSNBC @hughhewitt is just a Trump stooge. Why not Charlie Sikes? At least he's watchable. You're becoming Fox News lite
878303242282819584 2017-06-23 17:26:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter I'd be interested in knowing how many of those actually look past a headline to read the story and/or watch Fox News
878302756611567616 2017-06-23 17:24:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins It's getting harder and harder for me to watch @MSNBC. I used to keep it on all day, now I watch it maybe an hour a day (Maddox)

878273957685739521 2017-06-23 15:30:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins One can hope but it's unlikely that getting shot will make him a better man.
878235581745987585 2017-06-23 12:57:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateMajLdr You're a racist whose reaction to an African-American POTUS has damaged our country. You are responsible for the hatred & division.

878234708399861760 2017-06-23 12:54:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateMajLdr Are you ok with depriving millions of healthcare, punishing the sick and most vulnerable so you can give your donors a huge tax cut?
878234402769129472 2017-06-23 12:52:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @samstein I'm not sure how @FoxNews can call itself news. It's should be called Fox ass-kissing - on our knees all the time

877919480457838592 2017-06-22 16:01:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @chucktodd I don't think any of the @SenateGOP have the courage to stand up for the people they were elected to serve & stop this bill
877677862794473472 2017-06-21 00:01:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedBen @EsotericCD I don't understand how these guys get reelected. 80 yro politicians have no new ideas. @SenThadCochran hasn't done anything for MS
877546915998703616 2017-06-21 15:21:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @KFILE Ya think?
877506142108356609 2017-06-21 12:39:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidfrum I would love to see Republicans vote to let Trump use his office make money from foreign governments & have to explain that vote
877504817324863488 2017-06-21 12:33:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @senmarcorubio great use of taxpayer money to try and be cute. It isn't working, sort of like you
877355418321772545 2017-06-20 02:40:06 UTC <Bearnmind> Love how @DIRECTV says signal is occasionally interrupted when in fact, we lose the signal every time there's any hard rain in Biloxi
877339157001056257 2017-06-20 01:35:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler @toddzwillich Not surprising @SenRandPauI is a coward serving only himself as are all of @SenateGOP - always party before country #2018midterms
877323449563176962 2017-06-20 00:33:04 UTC <Bearnmind> Yet @SenJohnMcCain does nothing to stop it. When did he quit caring about Americans? Oh I remember- when he put Palin on his tickethttps://twitter.com/kasie/status/877199419367731200
877251398034968576 2017-06-20 19:46:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidfrum @nycjim Or it could be because he's an ignorant bigot who thinks so little of his base that he assumes everyone of them are also
877251151837769729 2017-06-20 19:45:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy @SenJohnMcCain frustrates me to no end. You see flashes of what he used to be but he no longer has the courage to buck the party.
877250708504027136 2017-06-20 19:44:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @HotlineJosh @dandrezner And what does it say that they're willing to take healthcare away from millions with no real passion for it

876565111120551940 2017-06-18 22:19:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @marcorubio campaign was embarrassing to watch. A failed campaign that revealed who he was and did so much damage to his image
876564618684104704 2017-06-18 22:17:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @wpjenna @PhilipRucker I honestly don't care what die-hard Trump supporters are doing or thinking unless they're apologizing for inflicting Trump on the world

876561841970966528 2017-06-18 22:06:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins You are one of the most joyful people I've ever seen. It's refreshing
876561317833977856 2017-06-18 22:04:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @cwarzel So he's admitting he's been deliberately lying and hurtful by spreading a conspiracy theory about Newton. What a vile human being
876233020495327232 2017-06-17 00:20:06 UTC <Bearnmind> One could make a case that @Scotus opened the door to make hatred, greed and power in our politics soar with Citizens United.
876232361821827072 2017-06-17 00:17:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @washingtonpost I don't recall - did he call for toning down the rhetoric after Gabby Giffords was shot?  He's a hypocrite.
876232077183791105 2017-06-17 00:16:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @washingtonpost everyone should forget what he said and not expect him to accept any accountability for the hatred he spews? Forgive me if I call bullshit
876231175374876672 2017-06-17 00:12:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid @brianstelter Assholes get shot too. Being a congressman doesn't make his shooting more tragic than any of the shootings that take place every day

876200833746120704 2017-06-17 22:12:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump On the bright side, you'll be remembered in history books as the worst POTUS ever. Way to leave a legacy as a colossal failure
876200530850217984 2017-06-17 22:11:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump The fact that you obstructed justice might be the reason too. I knew you were going to be a terrible POTUS but wow, you're a disaster

875853628589957121 2017-06-16 23:12:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy So basically, @realDonaldTrump is a deranged, obsessed, narcissist with the fingers of his itty bitty hands on the nuclear button.
875851123328004099 2017-06-16 23:02:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @POTUS @VP And all you had to sacrifice was character, ethics, morals and honesty.
875442846886756354 2017-06-15 20:00:14 UTC <Bearnmind> It worrries me that I didn't care that @HouseGOP member was shot. My concern was for the cops and staffers. I'm not proud of it.
875442374851407872 2017-06-15 19:58:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @MSNBC hypocrisy of baseball game billed as a way to help children as @GOP strip away health from millions of kids

875131812720279554 2017-06-14 23:24:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @ThePlumLineGS @realDonaldTrump firing Mueller would confirm his guilt. Innocent man would welcome the chance to clear his name.
875131643832545284 2017-06-14 23:23:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @StuPolitics If Trump fires Mueller, he should be impeached because the only reason he would do so is because he's guilty.

874796597581946880 2017-06-13 01:12:16 UTC <Bearnmind> It is a shame that @SenJohnMcCain will be remembered, not as a maverick or a man of character, but for sacrificing his integrity for Trump
874796007942434817 2017-06-13 01:09:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Who knew @jeffsessions is so scared of women that he gets nervous (our top LE official gets NERVOUS) when a woman asks him a question.

874792518398947328 2017-06-13 00:56:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins The @GOP @SenateGOP @SenJohnMcCain contempt for women is on display nationally yet again.

874790750034305024 2017-06-13 00:49:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm @SenTomCotton humiliated himself today bending over for Sessions and Trump. He clearly has no integrity or character just ambition
874789950394425344 2017-06-13 00:45:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @JakeSherman @SenateGOP @HouseGOP are finding out that bending over and kissing Trump's ass leaves a bad taste in their mouth. Too bad.

874788340054228994 2017-06-13 00:39:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN Seems impossible for @jeffsessions to be an effective AG given his constant memory loss. He came across as a man who's hiding something

872151019215605760 2017-06-06 17:59:41 UTC <Bearnmind> the best and most accurate description of @senmarcorubio I've ever seen. He's a spineless, craven, money-hungry & bent so far over for Trumphttps://twitter.com/erickfernandez/status/872135265296502784
872147712812228608 2017-06-06 17:46:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @DonaldJTrumpJr Um, you're as unqualified as your father. Please go away, the only one who cares what you have to say is you
872117189054275585 2017-06-06 15:45:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @TPM @joshtpm He does know there is a US military base there, doesn't he?
872056844499521537 2017-06-06 11:45:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @Bravotv Calling any of the #southerncharmSav "charmers"'is a stretch

871791399091314688 2017-06-05 18:10:41 UTC <Bearnmind> he has such contempt for Montana voters that though he assaulted someone & lied about it in a statement he thinks he deserves re-election
871579564526387201 2017-06-04 04:08:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @HouseGOP You passed a bill to deprive millions of healthcare, devastate Medicaid/Medicare & punish the sick. You are disgusting.  #VoteThemOut

871426760881053698 2017-06-04 18:01:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump We need a president who isn't an idiot and who doesn't continually globally humiliate and embarrass himself & our country

870718017298087936 2017-06-02 19:05:27 UTC <Bearnmind> Even lying @KellyannePolls husband doesn't want to work for Trump. Guess he didn't want to become someone like his wifehttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/870714657710977024
870717346536579073 2017-06-02 19:02:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood Actually @PressSec this is who the electoral college elected. He lost the popular vote by 3 million

870660991884812288 2017-06-02 15:18:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP again do nothing to stop Trump's idiocy. They care nothing about this country. Only money & power. #VoteThemOuthttps://twitter.com/jonathanchait/status/870649059270430720

870043939507650561 2017-05-31 22:26:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @PaulBegala Hey @realDonaldTrump Obama is still more popular than you. A better President and Lord knows a better man than you. Not even close
870042789240635392 2017-05-31 22:22:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @DylanByers The difference between @PressSec and Seth, the Press Sec on House of Cards is that Derek Cecil only plays a liar. Spicer is one IRL
870006773154947072 2017-05-31 19:59:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @MSNBC the difference between President Frank Underwood and @realDonaldTrump is Underwood is actually smart
870001285012914180 2017-05-31 19:37:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @politico Good. Someone has to take a stand and it certainly won't be the cowards in the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP nor Trump's lapdog @SpeakerRyan
870000732774178816 2017-05-31 19:35:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins He had no problems with the pain he caused Obama's young children with that birther crap
869947767057031168 2017-05-31 16:04:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan @NRSC @HouseGOP Trump is destroying everything good about America & you do nothing. When do you start caring about this country
869945943713431553 2017-05-31 15:57:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonathanchait If only @FLOTUS would take a good hard look at her husband. Now there's a mental health issue. But he has money so she ignores it
869945626548502528 2017-05-31 15:56:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @RosieGray Well @Reince deserves every degrading humiliation Trump gives him. He sold out his country for his party. He's no patriot, he's barely a man
869945224184737792 2017-05-31 15:54:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro @zarzarbinkss Demonstrating yet again that @seanhannity has no morals, ethics or character but has an amazing ability to bend over and kiss ass
869944770268807168 2017-05-31 15:52:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoyAnnReid He should have been tried for homicide
869943866442489858 2017-05-31 15:49:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump I'm sure your racist birther nonsense bothered Sasha or Malia. I believe Sasha was about your son's age, you unbelievably hypocrite

868968336348114944 2017-05-28 23:12:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @GovPhilBryant and the Republican legislature is working to ensure MS stays a top 5 state...in poverty, illness, etc. It's time for a change

868655708086169600 2017-05-27 02:30:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnCornyn You have chosen to put your party before your country & its people. You should be ashamed. You represent no one but yourself. #VoteThemOut
868655385250496512 2017-05-27 02:29:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnCornyn Is there any Republican in Congress who isn't a coward? Be a man & admit you're taking away healthcare to give a huge tax cut to the wealthy

868098962288508929 2017-05-26 13:38:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias No it's not better. There shouldn't be any "well at least he did"
868097966657216512 2017-05-26 13:34:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @GovernorBullock Unfortunately for the rest of the country, his election does represent the values of the people.

867941165596897280 2017-05-25 03:11:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @BrentBozell What a jerk you are. Get exposed and then lash out.
867940823668862976 2017-05-25 03:09:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @mmfa I guess dipping their toe in the waters of doing the decent thing felt wrong to them. Back to @FoxNews lying to their viewers.
867940169273401345 2017-05-25 03:07:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP And unfortunately after so many people had already voted and couldn't change their vote
867931119760658433 2017-05-25 02:31:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @baseballcrank Except the fact that so many people voted early and aren't allowed to change their vote
867928107134533636 2017-05-25 02:19:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan @brianbeutler @woodhouseb Surely he does. After all Ryan wanted to suspend Clinton's. Surely he's not that blatant a liar and hypocrite....oh wait he is
867924971745669120 2017-05-25 02:06:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @benwikler What an excellent point

867910948866207745 2017-05-25 01:11:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain @marcorubio @LindseyGrahamSC @chucktodd They no longer have the political courage, character or ethics to do anything about it but whine.
867910442462703617 2017-05-25 01:09:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @PoliticusSarah It should be a bigger deal that assault is condoned and encouraged by @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr
867910024647069697 2017-05-25 01:07:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @jk_rowling He's a global embarrassment. America's stature may never recover from this buffoon. But he's compensating. I wonder what for... ?
867909628650237954 2017-05-25 01:05:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Right because it's Dems body slamming and hitting reports, assaulting women and bragging about it, alienating allies. You're an idiot
867908842176348160 2017-05-25 01:02:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN Showing yet again what a buffoon and global embarrassment @realDonaldTrump is
867908626366726145 2017-05-25 01:01:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd @GsVicki Facts? What's this strange word you speak of?
867908430685712389 2017-05-25 01:01:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd This @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr have no courage or decency and clearly they care nothing about our country or people
867875512580026374 2017-05-25 22:50:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @williamlegate How pathetic is Trump. The majority of the country hates him and he's bragging about one poll that says only 52% of people hate him
867874172042653696 2017-05-25 22:45:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN What's happened to us? We've turned into a country that takes pleasure in others pain
867873946691043328 2017-05-25 22:44:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood Because @SpeakerRyan is a cruel, heartless coward who must take pleasure in hurting the most vulnerable among us.
867764537059102720 2017-05-25 15:29:22 UTC <Bearnmind> stupidity from @replouiegohmert but @RepTrentFranks should be ashamed of himself. Oh wait, @HouseGOP have no shame, or ethics, or moralshttps://twitter.com/braddjaffy/status/867744418945798145

867763414877306882 2017-05-25 15:24:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @JohnJHarwood @MeetThePress @GregForMontana is not only a criminal and a bully but a coward too. I can't believe he truly represents the good people of Montana
867763080310206465 2017-05-25 15:23:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics @SteveKopack Do his supporters know how NATO works? He made a fool of himself
867762466087997440 2017-05-25 15:21:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @cwarzel The @HouseGOP @SenateGOP did nothing after the slaughter of 20 1st graders and 6 teachers in Newtown. Let that sink in
867761660043382788 2017-05-25 15:17:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @MCJalonick By @RepDuncanHunter reasoning, anyone who sees a member of Congress should assault them because Lord knows they deserve it. Another coward.
867761202721632257 2017-05-25 15:16:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @StevenTDennis The cowardice of the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP always amazes me. We deserve better than these clowns. #VoteThemOut
867760474464690176 2017-05-25 15:13:13 UTC <Bearnmind> So @HouseGOP are ok with their members assaulting people. Makes sense since they were all peachy keen with Trump assaulting womenhttps://twitter.com/mikedebonis/status/867756789194006529
867759143217758208 2017-05-25 15:07:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy He sounds like a 5th grader reading a book report (not meaning to insult 5th graders)
867729868989005824 2017-05-25 13:11:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @tedlieu Well that and (for those who don't believe a thing unless it comes from Fox), the @FoxNews crew who confirmed Jacobs story.
867729064848760832 2017-05-25 13:08:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN She has sold her soul for money
867728897936429056 2017-05-25 13:07:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenKamalaHarris It's is mind-boggling that a man who doesn't respect or comply with the law is the nation's top law enforcement official. Up is down now
867595326793842688 2017-05-24 04:16:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan @brianbeutler Proving yet again that Ryan is a coward who cares more about power than he does his country, constitution or even just common decency
867594069077356544 2017-05-24 04:11:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @maggieNYT @KamenIntheLoop Too many votes have already been mailed in. He'll win. Question is why hasn't he been arrested yet?
867586221568118786 2017-05-24 03:40:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @GregForMontana @IntrovertDeb @brooklynmarie @danaros09 Well the @FoxNews report pretty much put a fork in his lies
867585979909120000 2017-05-24 03:39:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @GregForMontana But I will commit assault & lie about it because the law doesn't apply to me. Way to represent the good people of Montana and the @GOP
867585477150375936 2017-05-24 03:37:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @IngrahamAngle Thanks to @FoxNews for doing the right thing with an unexpected benefit of making you look like a fool
867572886273486851 2017-05-24 02:47:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Because @seanhannity is a liar and human scum.
867572525974335488 2017-05-24 02:46:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics @chucktodd The Republican Party is broken.  The Democrats aren't perfectbut all means let's keep on with false equivalency and blaming both
867572131093241856 2017-05-24 02:44:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @IngrahamAngle Wow, you've really reached new lows. I can't believe I used to listen to you. You just keep throwing away your character, morals & ethics
867568847724969988 2017-05-24 02:31:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @abbydphillip Maybe this current crops of Republican's first instinct is to lie. After all look how well it worked out for Trump
867568423873785856 2017-05-24 02:30:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias Ole party before country, destroying the Senate @SenateMajLdr is getting desperate. Luckily no one believes a word he says.
867554042511331330 2017-05-24 01:32:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP Sadly it probably made his supporters proud
867552896094797824 2017-05-24 01:28:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm Unfortunately stupidity is a prerequisite these days for @HouseGOP
867552470234431488 2017-05-24 01:26:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN I guess physical violence against the press is now a prerequisite for a @GOP house candidatehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fhoH4v8xYlU

866502173798150151 2017-05-21 03:53:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @RHOP_ really scraped the bottom of the barrel with this show. I just keep deleting @Bravotv shows from the DVR. Surely they can do better
866501155056230402 2017-05-21 03:49:08 UTC <Bearnmind> Gizelle is the @lisarinna of #rhop A housewife with no story line and a desperate need for airtime. Basically a lying shit stirrer
866499973831065600 2017-05-21 03:44:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @realityaddictx Robyn/Gizelle made asses of themselves in a trashy, classless way. @bravo scraped the bottom of the barrel with #RHOP
866487377585467393 2017-05-21 02:54:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @the_keepers @archbalt @aliknez Showing how little you actually care about the victims and how much you care about protecting pedophiles
866486776810139648 2017-05-21 02:52:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @archbalt So committed you did nothing for years. You were complicit in the abuse. It's easy to understand a lack of trust in religious institutions
866486402095222784 2017-05-21 02:50:31 UTC <Bearnmind> Wow does the @archbalt come off badly in #thekeepers Instead of trust and comfort, they were complicit in the abuse of the survivors.
866483583506145280 2017-05-21 02:39:19 UTC <Bearnmind> 2 years for the @FBI to respond to a FOIA request? #thekeepers
866477968725598208 2017-05-21 02:17:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins Billy Bush trying to be relevant and get his D list celebrity card back
866475382194798592 2017-05-21 02:06:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @WestWingReport He doesn't care about his base. Trump doesn't care about anyone but himself
866475141055868929 2017-05-21 02:05:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @KFILE Restraint surely, but you have to consider that the apple may not have fallen far from the tree
866474928471777280 2017-05-21 02:04:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @KFILE And cruel
866474780740001793 2017-05-21 02:04:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @JulianAssange @seanhannity If you're weren't worried that Trump colluded you wouldn't try so hard to find someone else to blame. You'd be confident in the truth
866474436836417536 2017-05-21 02:02:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @JulianAssange @seanhannity You just don't care how many people you hurt with your bullshit trying to protect your corrupt president. History will judge you harshly
866282786046582784 2017-05-21 13:21:25 UTC <Bearnmind> Trump slammed Michelle Obama for not covering hair in Saudi Arabia, but... http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-headscarf-saudi-arabia_us_5920f603e4b034684b0cdfdd?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 via @TheWorldPost

866052720326823936 2017-05-20 22:07:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @KFILE @CNN @SheriffClarke Which means you know you've done it. All those examples turned out to be true. Are you that desperate for any kind of fame?
866051510102315010 2017-05-20 22:02:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @ErikWemple @TuckerCarlson is so desperate to be D list "celebrity" he chucked all character/ethics/morals faster than Trump could say bend over
866050966696718336 2017-05-20 22:00:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @Andy @Realitytea I hope that a farewell to all the "housewives" of Atlanta is in our future. @Bravotv @andy love it when women tear down women evidently

865978720745598977 2017-05-20 17:13:10 UTC <Bearnmind> So @realDonaldTrump is an amateur. Duh.https://twitter.com/janeygodley/status/865975141217558531
865978491354976256 2017-05-20 17:12:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @foxnews where's the curtesy or bow on your newscast?https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/865969527703703553
865978039250898948 2017-05-20 17:10:28 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey @FoxNews this wasn't newsworthy?  Just one more way you fail to give your viewers accurate newshttps://twitter.com/igorvolsky/status/865972664409575424
865743620506341377 2017-05-19 01:38:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @GaryLegum You gotta love @andersoncooper when he's so fed up with bullshit and gives zero fucks
865743061162348544 2017-05-19 01:36:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @CillizzaCNN I pray that good conquers evil IRL and that Comey buries Trump. You have to wonder if the fate of our democracy rests with Mueller and Comey
865742401977110530 2017-05-19 01:34:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews If only you applied that standard to your cesspool. You've tortured the Rich family with your lies & then get self-righteous?
865741967820562432 2017-05-19 01:32:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol Can we all agree to just never utter the words Anthony Weiner again?
865740815896891393 2017-05-19 01:27:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @abbydphillip @BraddJaffy If the idiot-in-chief @realDonaldTrump had nothing to hide or didn't collude he wouldn't be trying so hard to stop the investigation #guilty
865740380796592128 2017-05-19 01:26:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @RealJamesWoods Have you always been this vile? I thought it was just a character you played frequently not an actual character trait.
865740067616288768 2017-05-19 01:24:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @RogerJStoneJr Someone as vile and disgusting as you upset that @MikePenceVP is showing his stripes as an immoral politician is laughable
865739718222282752 2017-05-19 01:23:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnAvlon Um that's not a debate, that's a slaughter of @RickSantorum who clearly sold out whatever morals or ethics he had when he kneeled to Trump
865739207502901248 2017-05-19 01:21:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattapuzzo @EricSchmittNYT @MarkLandler Is there any member of the Trump family that isn't corrupt and vile?  Is there not one decent human being in that family?
865738768963293188 2017-05-19 01:19:41 UTC <Bearnmind> The things done to these women by priests in #thekeepers are horrific. The Catholic Church has a lot to answer for.
865655137997471744 2017-05-19 19:47:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump You're a global embarrassment to our country and we're all cringing in anticipation of what new stupid thing you're going to do.
865653920642744320 2017-05-19 19:42:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP care nothing for the rule of law, the constitution or our democracy. They only care about getting reelected
865415950463410180 2017-05-18 03:56:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @Bravotv @Realitytea Now I can delete #RHOC from my DVR record list. women tearing down other women = @bravotv formula for every crap show.
865362640553562112 2017-05-18 00:25:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonathanvswan @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @HouseGOP wouldn't be worried if they had done nothing wrong. I hope they are exposed. #VoteThemOut
865358073447284736 2017-05-18 00:06:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @emilysteel it's sad that not being able to continue to sexually harass and demean women was viewed as hatred by Roger and Bill
865357569598136321 2017-05-18 00:04:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @maddow @HouseGOP @SenateGOP - what's the status of the bill that eliminates the Congressional exemption from their healthcare bill?
865356884961890304 2017-05-18 00:02:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @GM And btw the reason both dealerships gave for not fixing it was that it was under warranty and they don't get paid for those repairs
865356677524094976 2017-05-18 00:01:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @GM He has been a loyal customer for 12 years, $200k for 4 trucks and a camaro. It's hard to stay loyal to a brand when they treat you this way
865355955214721025 2017-05-18 23:58:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @GM He finally got them to hear the noise & they're going to fix it. It only took 4 visits to 2 dealers, 5 days w/o his truck & 8 phone calls
865282416503554048 2017-05-18 19:06:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @GenFlynn Ah the irony that you were clearly talking about yourself
865281587751026688 2017-05-18 19:03:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @EricWolfson @realDonaldTrump is very good at playing the pathetically weak victim
865281360931549184 2017-05-18 19:02:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy Anyone surprised that @PressSec is being demoted? He puts too public a face on all Trump (and his own) lies
865280707328974849 2017-05-18 18:59:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP @SenateGOP a reminder that you're pushing an agenda the majority of Americans don't want #VoteThemOut
865235933632790528 2017-05-18 16:01:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @newtgingrich Like you know what honesty or integrity looks like. Go away you disgraced former Speaker. You're irrelevant
865235727755489281 2017-05-18 16:00:47 UTC <Bearnmind> In 2018 let's remember that @SenateMajLdr & every @SenateGOP destroyed the Senate with the nuclear option. They should all be #VoteThemOut
865235036811010048 2017-05-18 15:58:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @GM I saw the DM and basically you're saying deal with the person who has not resolved this issue. I see a Ford in our future

865040172378968065 2017-05-17 03:03:43 UTC <Bearnmind> So @MikePenceVP lied. No shock there. He's Trump litehttps://twitter.com/braddjaffy/status/865029467466543104
865039868774289408 2017-05-17 03:02:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm @realDonaldTrump has a man crush on Flynn

865039095755669504 2017-05-17 02:59:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @POTUS @RealAlexJones You just get more idiotic. Is this you or "your character"
865038324632780801 2017-05-17 02:56:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @GM Just sent it and contact info. Thanks
864986039290662917 2017-05-17 23:28:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @theodoricmeyer @MatthewNussbaum @politico @mikepence signed on to the ticket betting on this. But he's as bad as Trump in his complete disregard for the people
864985568031244288 2017-05-17 23:26:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins Fox viewers don't want the truth, they want affirmation. They are deliberately blind
864985386262691841 2017-05-17 23:26:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @Andy @Bravotv @andy with all the trash show you're running do your viewers a favor & bring back the 1 quailty show you have @ThePeoplesCouch
864983548280926208 2017-05-17 23:18:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @washingtonpost @JohnJHarwood @jimrutenberg Appropriate that a tape confirms that @SpeakerRyan and @GOPLeader lie routinely
864981968076898304 2017-05-17 23:12:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @oliverdarcy @CillizzaCNN @brianstelter I guess lack of ethics, morals or journalist standards are a job requirement at @FoxNews. And course racial & sexual harassment expertise
864981462134775808 2017-05-17 23:10:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @GM our 2016 Silverado (2016 spec edi) has an issue. Chevy & dealership have done nothing to fix it. What do we have to do to get help?
864876890938634240 2017-05-17 16:14:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @OrrinHatch @daveweigel @sahilkapur All that bending over for Trump must be causing the blood to rush to his head to say something that stupid
864874152183959553 2017-05-17 16:04:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller He's just toying with us and the idiot-in-chief. We've become a laughingstock
864874041626304513 2017-05-17 16:03:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller When Putin is your best defense you're in trouble.
864873902706655232 2017-05-17 16:03:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @DonaldJTrumpJr Well gee, if Donnie, Jr says it it must be true ...said no one ever
864873650628984832 2017-05-17 16:02:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood News flash for @SpeakerRyan -  No one thinks that and thanks to him & @SenateMajLdr no one believes Congress works for anyone but themselves
864643648281088000 2017-05-16 00:48:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @rachaelmbade @DarrellIssa No one believes a word you say so don't even
864643479254814720 2017-05-16 00:47:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @MarkHalperin Once you're a Trump hack you're always a Trump hack
864635484328402948 2017-05-16 00:15:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood The irony of Cruz whose wife was attacked and who declared Trump unfit and then supported him calling anyone else amoral
864625713105829888 2017-05-16 23:36:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrissyteigen She is adorable
864625194354319361 2017-05-16 23:34:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @RepCurbelo That's the best you can do given all Trump has done. Does any Republican in Congress have a shred of courage or character anymore?
864624914980057088 2017-05-16 23:33:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @KellyannePolls credibility is history (as is any ethics, morals or character she may have had). She's a laughingstock and deservedly sohttps://twitter.com/joenbc/status/864152358481166336
864623078004973568 2017-05-16 23:26:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @stevethomma @newtgingrich wants to shut down press briefings? Not have Trump actually be competent or less stupid. Let's all remember Newt's character
864622789139062785 2017-05-16 23:25:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter And yet again @FoxNews shows why they have no credibility.

864621586028089344 2017-05-16 23:20:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @JakeSherman @SpeakerRyan has shown everyone that the hype about him was wrong and that he's just a power-hungry coward with no regard for the people

847508103603957760 2017-03-30 17:57:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP There should be some consequence for Trump falsely accusing Obama of a felony.
847507877350658054 2017-03-30 17:56:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @EricWolfson Trump and this White House is like keystone cops but less intelligent.
847507054503833600 2017-03-30 17:53:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @ChrisChristie is either guilty or a moronic bully who was clueless about what was going on around him. Either way his career is deadhttps://twitter.com/joyannreid/status/847191950000369665
847506405879721985 2017-03-30 17:50:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy @DevinNunes looks like Trump's moronic puppet.  He's lost all credibility. He shouldn't be Chairman of anything.
847488414496702464 2017-03-30 16:39:18 UTC <Bearnmind> After @DevinNunes incompetence, what little trust Americans have left in Congress rests with @SenateGOP investigation into Trump/Russia
847485999097761792 2017-03-30 16:29:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenateMajLdr will be reviled by history as the man who refused to do his constitutional duty & who destroyed the Senate. Quite the legacyhttps://twitter.com/theatlantic/status/847416572410904577

847245362142167041 2017-03-29 00:33:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonathanchait @SpeakerRyan is craven, dishonest & overrated. History will rip him apart, deservedly so.
847243420804317187 2017-03-29 00:25:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @anamariecox you know @realDonaldTrump knows he's not 1/4 of the man or President Obama is. Money can't buy class or character.
847242047467642883 2017-03-29 00:20:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @MarkLandler Maybe @FLOTUS should start with her husband since he regularly diminishes women. Or @PressSec but I think he's hopeless
847101043922161665 2017-03-29 15:00:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump because they didn't apologize, their subscriptions are up and you're a lying idiot that most of the country hates

847051795520241664 2017-03-29 11:44:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP who knew when Trump said grab them by the p***y he was really talking about the GOP p***ies in Congress.

846915570482237440 2017-03-28 02:43:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @realityaddictx Reality TV shows who @lisarinna really is - a mean, vindictive, woman desperate for fame. No storyline except mean gossip

846857398715383809 2017-03-28 22:51:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins and we can't even get @Bravotv to bring back @ThePeoplesCouch which is their best show. 
846857185611173892 2017-03-28 22:51:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @DevinNunes Why are you lying?  What are you trying (badly) to hide. You should resign or at least recuse yourselfhttps://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/846524781121941504

846568086627127296 2017-03-27 03:42:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump bet you'd love to have that high of an approval rate right now. Going down in history as the fastest worst POTUS ever
846102280583761927 2017-03-26 20:51:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @seanhannity is all of the above an option?  I'd be happy with just never seeing or hearing you in TV. You're revolting
845797649244737536 2017-03-25 00:40:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan Your failure is a victory for the millions of families Trump/Ryancare would have hurt.
845795827708805120 2017-03-25 00:33:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @PressSec it's funny how your words can come back to haunt you. You go and take your nap so you'll be ready to lie again on Mondayhttps://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/229644347228950528

845273541742383104 2017-03-24 13:58:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @AmazonHelp yes for the 2nd time this month and yes I've called customer service who says they are very sorry. It's always USPS deliveries
845273198992281601 2017-03-24 13:56:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @NRSC @SenateMajLdr used to send our best to Congress now it's the self-serving dregs of society who serve themselves
845271120798474241 2017-03-24 13:48:34 UTC <Bearnmind> By passing a bill so widely unpopular with Americans @HouseGOP shows that they don't serve their constituents & will lose seats in 2018.
845270728035516418 2017-03-24 13:47:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro the only good thing about this bill is that @HouseGOP will lose seats on 2018 & @realDonaldTrump will be a 1 term national nightmare
845270014110449664 2017-03-24 13:44:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @VP you're as much of a liar as Trump, just not as good at it. This bill will harm millions, esp women & you're proud. You're a disgrace
845269630398713856 2017-03-24 13:42:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan wrote a bill harming millions of Americans, esp women; giving tax break to the wealthy & insurance com. You must be so proud.
845269023222874112 2017-03-24 13:40:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood 1 more reason why Congress is hated. They pass a bill harming millions and moderates say well the Senate will kill it
845268239735275521 2017-03-24 13:37:07 UTC <Bearnmind> Looks like the @freedomcaucus is caving again. What a bunch of cowards. It's not surprising that Congress is despised by voters
845267664092254208 2017-03-24 13:34:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @WLOX - do a story on what @StevenPalazzo @SenThadCochran and @GovPhilBryant have done to help insure MS voters?  It will only take 1 min
845266476516958208 2017-03-24 13:30:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @StevenPalazzo Trumpcare is going to hurt so many MS citizens.Hopefully voters will vote no to you for reelection. I will.

845002720897617925 2017-03-23 20:02:02 UTC <Bearnmind> I've been deleting @Bravotv shows off my DVR. They're all the same show just different locations. Except @ThePeoplesCouch which isn't on
845001544927993860 2017-03-23 19:57:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @LindseyGrahamSC What a hypocrite. You refused to do your job for Merrick and are now willing to blow up the Senate. Congress is repulsivehttps://twitter.com/kfile/status/844997256197689345
844634209914359809 2017-03-22 19:37:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump falsely accused Obama of a felony and was caught lying. @DevinNunes just sold out his credibility to protect the lie
844633822964727809 2017-03-22 19:36:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @DevinNunes security clearance should be revoked. Putting party over country and the American people again. What he did is disgraceful
844633266724442113 2017-03-22 19:33:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @DevinNunes has shown he is at best incompetent for his role as Intel Chair; at worst, he's corrupt. This is why people hate Congresshttps://twitter.com/mattortega/status/844629634121695236
844396197070749698 2017-03-21 03:51:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan has no decency or compassion. History will pillory himhttps://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/844381200441626624

844370526671962112 2017-03-21 02:09:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpillrealityT you absolutely nailed it. @lisarinna is desperate. She used to be my favorite, now I just want her to go.
844369066806706177 2017-03-21 02:04:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @realityaddictx and @lisarinna proves she's low class
844368199252672512 2017-03-21 02:00:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @AnaTrolli76 I know. She has no storyline or anything interesting to say. She's useless on this show
844367890048520197 2017-03-21 01:59:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @lisarinna @Andy @girl_devious Yes please
844363783875256320 2017-03-21 01:43:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea ever notice that @lisarinna never has an original thought. She just repeats what others say. Eileen is just a Greek chorus
844360045961756672 2017-03-21 01:28:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea because @lisarinna has to get on everyone else's storyline. She has none of her own. She's gotten even more repulsive this year
844359230903767040 2017-03-21 01:25:02 UTC <Bearnmind> Have to agree with Dorit @lisarinna is low class. @Andy please let this be her last season. She adds nothing #RHOBH

843071174724763648 2017-03-18 12:06:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @brithume the majority of voters have antipathy towards Trump. Probbly because he's a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic liar
843070382739546112 2017-03-18 12:03:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan is the worst of America. Hurting the most vulnerable must be his full-time passion. Congress only hurts people now.https://twitter.com/adamcancryn/status/842763734280036354
842106521706217473 2017-03-15 20:13:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP and Snoop Dogg's video. That's a top priority for racist-in-chief @realDonaldTrump
842103482480001036 2017-03-15 20:01:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood so he lied. It should be news when @realDonaldTrump tells the truth. It happens so seldom

841488355246379009 2017-03-13 03:17:12 UTC <Bearnmind> Hopefully the cast watched this season and realize they all (except one of the twins) look bad #summerhouse
841487613466988546 2017-03-13 03:14:15 UTC <Bearnmind> Lindsay is the worst. She is unbelievably self-absorbed and just mean. #summerhouse

823016267904851977 2017-01-21 03:55:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @samsteinhp Doesn't matter if @PressSec believed it. Trump made a liar of him in front of the world. No one will believe a word he says.
823015922009067520 2017-01-21 03:54:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @PressSec @mattyglesias Fox News might as well be called the State run propaganda channel. They have no credibility

823014344762019844 2017-01-21 03:48:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @AriFleischer so are you calling it lying?  You seem to have side-stepped that.
823014175618330624 2017-01-21 03:47:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @KFILE So since by his own words @PressSec isn't worth his weight on salt. Accurate measurement is that he is worth his weight in bullshit

822809959549300737 2017-01-21 14:15:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Love that no one really showed up for your parade. That's because the majority of Americans despise you.
822809724378824705 2017-01-21 14:15:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump not many people cared about seeing your inauguration. You're historically unpopular so at least some showed up

822508817246285825 2017-01-20 18:19:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP funny but sad because it's true. @SpeakerRyan care nothing for the poor or even the American people as a whole. Only power and party

815741568279871493 2017-01-01 02:08:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @BravoATLWives can we get new cast members or are you just going to let them all humiliate themselves first?
815739561418620928 2017-01-01 02:00:41 UTC <Bearnmind> Clearly Real housewives isn't the same as real women. When Real women with character are told a secret, they keep it a secret.  #RHOA
815737623775997952 2017-01-01 01:52:59 UTC <Bearnmind> Being a Real Housewife must mean "bravo-lebrity, "D" list fame and money > self-respect & true friendship. No friendships survive #RHOA
815735017360003072 2017-01-01 01:42:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @kaylagothe411 I know. There's just something  about him that seems off.
815733892804120577 2017-01-01 01:38:10 UTC <Bearnmind> Seems Kandi's only good trait is her love for her kids. But her mother is a mean, unhappy woman.  #RHOA
815732360591396864 2017-01-01 01:32:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @Andy @Bravotv easy to see why ratings are falling. How low do they have to go to get rid of Kandi, Cynthia &  Kenya #RHOA
815731760122200064 2017-01-01 01:29:41 UTC <Bearnmind> When showing your breasts is the best you've got for a storyline it's time to leave. @Andy @Bravotv time to rejuvenate the cast #RHOA
815730680227364864 2017-01-01 01:25:24 UTC <Bearnmind> Cynthia is so boring. @KenyaMoore should get her a rent-a-man like she does for herself & then Cynthia can have a fake storyline too #RHOA
815729478261473282 2017-01-01 01:20:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @Andy Kandi's showing her true nature as a snake & Kenya's whining bc another fake b/f isn't following his script.  @andy pls fire them #RHOA
815728097827979264 2017-01-01 01:15:08 UTC <Bearnmind> Kandi's Mom and her friends seem to do all Kandi's thinking for her but wow is Kandi vicious. She & Kenya are both snakes.  Kandi #RHOA
813850628502016000 2016-12-27 20:54:45 UTC <Bearnmind> 2016 can't end soon enough. #CarrieFisher

810702783578075137 2016-12-18 04:26:20 UTC <Bearnmind> When did Kandi become such a mean and unlikeable person? #rhoa #realhousewivesofatlanta
808134046597476353 2016-12-11 02:19:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @teeombay1920 I guess @KenyaMoore didn't hire anyone to check continuity in the script she wrote for her and Matt. Bad acting, bad writing.
808133798995128321 2016-12-11 02:18:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @Bravotv please no more Mama Joyce talking head interviews. No more Mama Joyce on Tv would be even better.https://twitter.com/mzmotweets/status/808131782956765186
808133498775150592 2016-12-11 02:16:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @_JayAntonio I guess she's not worried about getting hurt since she hired him to act like her crazy boyfriend.
808133024747548672 2016-12-11 02:15:02 UTC <Bearnmind> or become better actors to make this fake relationship look somewhat real. Kenya got what she paid for by hiring Matt
808132634287230978 2016-12-11 02:13:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @Andy @Bravotv @bravotv @andy the most interesting things on #rhoa are Kenya's dogs. An hour of them would be preferable to this train wreck.
808131900992868354 2016-12-11 02:10:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @Bravotv So did @KenyaMoore hire Matt to fake drama (the acting is so bad) so she could what? Become an advocate against bad relationships?
808129898321739776 2016-12-11 02:02:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea @Bravotv @Andy I can't imagine how any of the cast of #rhoa  can watch themselves & be proud of how they act. #whonottobecome
808129214356586498 2016-12-11 01:59:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea Who is this new @Kandi . I used to like her but honestly she's just like the rest of these women now. Bitchy and mean.
808126673514328064 2016-12-11 01:49:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea Mama Joyce doing her best to get her own peach. She's just mean-spirited. My least favorite of my already least favorite show
808125798339280896 2016-12-11 01:46:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea well @KenyaMoore got what she paid for. Fake boyfriend fake drama. All of it boring and dull.
808124829572497408 2016-12-11 01:42:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @Bravotv seriously it's time to cancel #rhoa  None of these women have an interesting storyline and they've all become unwatchable
808124559916494848 2016-12-11 01:41:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @Bravotv @Andy @andy @Realitytea @bravotv Does @KenyaMoore have a story line that's not hiring men to act like her boyfriend? #rhoa is just boring now
808123426837823489 2016-12-11 01:36:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea I have never seen a more vindictive and petty woman than Mama Joyce. The only one after Kandi's money is her.

796410638453051392 2016-11-09 17:54:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @abbydphillip @brianstelter @anuswizard Bullshit. He's a racist. I've listened to him live.
796405532131262470 2016-11-09 17:34:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller the first google search that pops up when you type America is "Is America doomed". Telling
796405281232191494 2016-11-09 17:33:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @abbydphillip Yep, our new President @realDonaldTrump is a racist. You can't and shouldn't try to dress that up.
796405121697595392 2016-11-09 17:32:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @washingtonpost @pbump People need to understand that we are not a democracy. We are a Republic. There is a difference
796404820198428673 2016-11-09 17:31:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @POTUS @HuffPostPol It does. It sends a message that you can demean & sexually assault women & still be elected POTUS if you're a white male
796404625335320584 2016-11-09 17:30:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @POTUS @HuffPostPol It doesn't feel that way now. It's white males against everyone else. Back to the 1960s
796404274909609986 2016-11-09 17:29:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @Slate @chrislhayes given Trump's threats against the media, a free press will be essential. Let's see if they exhibit courage.
796402088892858368 2016-11-09 17:20:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins @KFILE We now have to teach our kids to not be like the POTUS. He's a bully, racist, bigot, misogynist not a role model
796401071652564993 2016-11-09 17:16:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Right now I don't consider you to be my president. I detest you & everything you stand for. Change my mind
796400883324096512 2016-11-09 17:15:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump You have to be humble & put the people of this country before yourself & your interests or else you will destroy it
796400720417357824 2016-11-09 17:15:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump You have to put aside your monstrous ego. You have a 61% disapproval right starting out. More voted against you than 4 you
796400396860264448 2016-11-09 17:13:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @OliviaMesser And so it begins
796400191020691456 2016-11-09 17:12:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @ReutersBiz He alone can stop it. he's going to being back all the manufacturing jobs
796399985034141696 2016-11-09 17:12:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidplouffe Dear rest of the world, I'm sorry we've ceded the moral high ground on human rights for women, LBGT, disabled and minorities
796385084458856449 2016-11-09 16:12:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix and they now have no room to complain about Trump's election. If you didn't vote, shut up
796345164411392000 2016-11-09 13:34:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @dunecat1 our white friends are assuring our female, minority and muslim friends that they didn't vote for Trump. #notmypresident
796344584859222016 2016-11-09 13:31:59 UTC <Bearnmind> I believe in love, diversity and tolerance. @realDonaldTrump is #notmypresident
796344401438134273 2016-11-09 13:31:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @thefix @christianwferry seems to me that this is similar to the way the @gop treated Obama
796343799089917953 2016-11-09 13:28:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @washingtonpost Mid-year elections are vitally important now with no check on this racist @GOP party
796338703073480704 2016-11-09 13:08:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedNews @dcbigjohn And therein lies the problem. White America, not America. Diversity & tolerance lost today
796338353251688452 2016-11-09 13:07:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @thefix the pressure is on @gop to deliver all the things they say will improve the economy/healthcare. They have no excuse/place to hide
796338024275656705 2016-11-09 13:05:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @secupp because he isn't a bigot? Please at least be honest
796337566387752961 2016-11-09 13:04:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @washingtonpost @thefix I overestimated the decency of this country. Trump's election sent a message that only white people are equal
796336984146976768 2016-11-09 13:01:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @mmurraypolitics We have voted for our own potential destruction & sent a message that all aren't created equal.
796336562921476096 2016-11-09 13:00:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump I pray for this country w/you as POTUS but remember more voted against you than for you. You have to set aside your ego
796336282549026816 2016-11-09 12:58:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @washingtonpost @thefix I have to admit I'm going to enjoy watching the new asshole POTUS react to the constant criticism he will get
796311101457727488 2016-11-09 11:18:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP A POTUS elected by white people for white people who insults minorities, immigrants, demeans & assaults women.
796208770200305664 2016-11-08 04:32:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @kylegriffin1 @RyanLizza I'm am disappointed
796207477696106496 2016-11-08 04:27:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy @KatyTurNBC We're going to have a president with a starting disapproval rate of 61%.
796207232828444672 2016-11-08 04:26:11 UTC <Bearnmind> WI is going to hand the election to Trump. This is truly sad.
796205756949336064 2016-11-08 04:20:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @KellyannePolls Congrats, you may just well be the architect of the destruction of our democracy
796205464971333632 2016-11-08 04:19:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @HillaryClinton @ScottNevins I'm praying she can hold PA, MI, NV and IA. I just don't want to believe this country will elect a racist
796204953895366660 2016-11-08 04:17:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @samsteinhp I only hope that it he wins, the people who voted for him take ownership for his actions
796204631298895873 2016-11-08 04:15:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @dorseyshaw @chrislhayes A racist @GOP will have complete run of this country. Devastating
796196507909292032 2016-11-08 03:43:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @greenfield64 any protest votes got their wish
796193976751685632 2016-11-08 03:33:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire I shudder to think of a President Trump elected by the white vote only
796187579712475138 2016-11-08 03:08:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix looks like MI a real possibility
796186506369048577 2016-11-08 03:03:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood What's scary is that if Trump wins; he has zero chance of uniting the country
796185437232631812 2016-11-08 02:59:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix Just please God don't let it be a tie
796185266511876096 2016-11-08 02:58:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix it also says that we're a long way from racial equality and respect for women
796184921328979968 2016-11-08 02:57:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP If she keeps VA we're right back where we were
796183724346003456 2016-11-08 02:52:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler Comey
796183547233103873 2016-11-08 02:52:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @UpshotNYT @mckaycoppins It seems hinky with that much change with no swing states called yet
796183347340910598 2016-11-08 02:51:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @RyanLizza @henryolsenEPPC I have no idea but it seems premature panic unless VA goes to Trump. Just my opinion.
796182775086850048 2016-11-08 02:49:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @RyanLizza @henryolsenEPPC I understand, I'm nervous. I don't quite get why everyone is freaking out with her best states still out
796182265898397696 2016-11-08 02:46:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR I'm not sure why the panic. Nothing unexpected has really happened. She doesn't have to have Fl
796181728671002624 2016-11-08 02:44:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @davidgrayrhodes @MajorCBS @CBSNews I think everyone is panicking because how close it is. Her best states aren't in yet
796181538404782084 2016-11-08 02:44:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR But her best states aren't in yet. I'm trying hard not to panic
796181319323631616 2016-11-08 02:43:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins I wouldn't want to be James Comey right now
796180417984479232 2016-11-08 02:39:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @StuPolitics If she holds VA, PA then opinion will change again
796179317038444545 2016-11-08 02:35:16 UTC <Bearnmind> This would tear the country apart if a gerrymandered House elected the president. Or faithless electorshttps://twitter.com/thefix/status/796178763864305664
796179019372920832 2016-11-08 02:34:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @ddale8 And what that says about our country makes me sad
796178876179349504 2016-11-08 02:33:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @henryolsenEPPC @RyanLizza she didn't have to win FL. If she holds VA, MI, CO & PA

796176439120973824 2016-11-08 02:23:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @Rsherlock @brianstelter The damage to this country from a POTUS win with only white votes will be disasterous
796176231125422080 2016-11-08 02:23:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @steveschale @mmurraypolitics if she holds VA, everyone can calm down

793401126964133888 2016-11-01 10:35:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @Slate It really is unacceptable and insane that Trump got away with not releasing his taxes. http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2016/10/it_really_is_insane_that_trump_got_away_with_not_releasing_his_tax_returns.html?wpsrc=sh_all_tab_tw_top via @slate
793292603227791362 2016-10-31 03:24:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenatorBurr @KellyAyotte @marcorubio @SenJohnMcCain should be voted out. For 6 yrs, they took taxpayer salary & did nothing for the people
793292029325369345 2016-10-31 03:22:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenatorBurr has told us if HRC is elected, the @GOP is going to once again ignore the will of the majority and abuse their power yet againhttps://twitter.com/mkraju/status/793208026547286020
793281557666684928 2016-10-31 02:40:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @housewifepolls1 and @vgunvalson
793281458895020032 2016-10-31 02:40:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @bravotc @RHOC_KellyDodd Says vile things and then whines and says she's being ganged up on. Please let her be one and done.
793281115998093312 2016-10-31 02:38:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @Bravotv please get rid of Vicki and Kelly. There's enough crazy & lying on In our politics. I can't watch another season with those two.
793280251229048832 2016-10-31 02:35:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @people hopefully @Bravotv will realize that @vgunvalson adds nothing to the show and axe her and make Brianna a full time cast member
793279510594617345 2016-10-31 02:32:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @Bravotv Did @vgunvalson really call the show hers in the reunion?  She's the least interesting part of the show & one no one would miss
793249066926936064 2016-10-31 00:31:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy so @SenatorBurr hates the 1st amend but loves the 2nd. A @GOP Senator making an assassination joke is vile. Vote him out
793246434451714048 2016-10-31 00:21:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidfrum @brianefallon @FranklinFoer Where's the FBI statement?  Collusion w/foreign power to influence our election seems ...important
793246039314694144 2016-10-31 00:19:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @pbump was @KellyannePolls always this much of a liar and hypocrite or has Trump enhanced this part of her character?
793245562493607936 2016-10-31 00:17:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @HillaryClinton When politics disgusts me, I just look at this face and remember the vote I cast for you ensures her future.pic.twitter.com/qAjHvZStqb
793202507401072640 2016-10-31 21:26:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @ChadLivengood Trump@lies with impunity about everything, just makes stuff up because there are no consequences.
793201999558930432 2016-10-31 21:24:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @karentravers @maggieNYT Because a lying, racist who assaults and demeans women is such a role model. He has mental issues
793201654304768000 2016-10-31 21:23:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @frankthorp @mmurraypolitics This is just vile. Hard not to use the word deplorable.
793201365006843904 2016-10-31 21:21:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea this season of #RHOC reinforces that @vgunvalson is a horrible, vindication person. It really is time for @Bravotv to fire her
793188152517230594 2016-10-31 20:29:26 UTC <Bearnmind> And @tedcruz just proved that his wife matters less to him than politics. What a coward and hypocrite. Kiss those 2020 hopes goodbye.https://twitter.com/teddyschleifer/status/793182222727733252
793187374943666176 2016-10-31 20:26:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @politico @ZekeJMiller The @gop candidates & Trump are waging an all out assault on freedom of the press & constitution.
793186578524999680 2016-10-31 20:23:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @samsteinhp Ok, now this makes it seem like Comey's letter was intended to impact the election.
793156499728138240 2016-10-31 18:23:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN tell us about your high standards & integrity as your pundit, still paid by Trump, gets off Trump's plane. You guys are unbelievablehttps://twitter.com/sopandeb/status/787417127305240577
793156152683065346 2016-10-31 18:22:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNMoney @brianstelter But @CNN gives Trump free air & is peachy hiring a paid shill like Lewandowski as a commentator. What hypocrites.
793155739116310529 2016-10-31 18:20:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNMoney @DylanByers @brianstelter I don't get CNN. They hire a shill paid by Trump in Lewandowski so this moral outrage is hypocritical
793155199284178948 2016-10-31 18:18:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @tcberenson @brianstelter I know. It's not like @CNN hires consultants paid by Trump. The shop has sailed on CNN's integrity/standards
793154486667710465 2016-10-31 18:15:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel so poor millionaires don't get a fair shake?  This guy's arrogance is astounding
793078003798511616 2016-10-31 13:11:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @Newsweek @morningmika @Morning_Joe @MSNBC @88Gsp @BrenKLarkin I forgot about that one
793070330449453057 2016-10-31 12:41:15 UTC <Bearnmind> What's even more troubling is that despite historically low approval ratings & no accomplishments @SenateGOP @HouseGOP do nothing different
793070027146665984 2016-10-31 12:40:03 UTC <Bearnmind> We used to send our best to Congress. Now thanks to the @GOP only the worst get elected. @HouseGOP @SenateGOP < roaches and plague
793069183839895553 2016-10-31 12:36:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @washingtonpost Need motivation to vote? The @HouseGOP @SenateGOP are threatening another temper tantrum if Trump isn't elected. Dump @GOP
793062588405915648 2016-10-31 12:10:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @morningmika @Morning_Joe @MSNBC @88Gsp I agree. The bias I see on morning hoe is pro-Trump. They ignore sexual assault, taxes, rape, etc
793062276014149632 2016-10-31 12:09:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @lisom @MSNBC @Morning_Joe I agree. I've watched since 2007 but now hardly ever. The show has become unwatchable
793061859146498048 2016-10-31 12:07:36 UTC <Bearnmind> I've watched @Morning_Joe since 2007 & kept @MSNBC on all day; but they've been terrible this election. I seldom watch either now.
793060025312960516 2016-10-31 12:00:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @morning_joe@opinions of @JoeNBC @morningmika have been damaged by their Trump bias this election. Can you consider new hosts? 1/2
793059472256167936 2016-10-31 11:58:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @CNN there's an audience to be had for an unbiased, balanced, interesting, engaging Morning news show. None exist right now
793058527162015744 2016-10-31 11:54:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @MSNBC @msnbc's best offering in the am is Republican @JoeNBC, pompous, has been blowhard vs Democrat @morningmika, doormat. Winner = @cnn new day
793055764206219265 2016-10-31 11:43:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @msnbc Do you read the tweets about this show?  Not many have anything positive to say about this garbage show.
793055531036471297 2016-10-31 11:42:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe Because your show is such an open and unbiased forum? You bend over for Trump every day.
793054766096154624 2016-10-31 11:39:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC needs to take a hard look @Morning_Joe & their obvious bias & inaccuracy this election if they want to keep their ratings.
793054123092537344 2016-10-31 11:36:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe just keep letting @KellyannePolls and Trump slid on concealing his taxes and his sexual assaults. #morningjoe
793053397922484225 2016-10-31 11:33:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @MarkHalperin @jheil @Morning_Joe @srwjo All three are jokes
793053185564958721 2016-10-31 11:33:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @morningmika @JoeNBC have pushed Trump's habitual sexual assault under the rug. They're shilling for man who demeans & assaults women.
793052681027944448 2016-10-31 11:31:08 UTC <Bearnmind> Seriously @morningmika @JoeNBC don't you guys get tired of carrying Trump's water? Are you that desperate to get back in with him?
793052303578333185 2016-10-31 11:29:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @KellyannePolls @thefix Ironic considering the stain of sexual assault & pathological lying seems to be peachy keen with her.
793051973041983488 2016-10-31 11:28:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Someone needs to get the @msnbc Morning Joe crew some lube this morning. Bending over for Trump is hard work

792894139079753732 2016-10-30 01:01:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea couldn't agree more. She adds nothing to this show. Hopefully she won't be back
792774461925756928 2016-10-30 17:05:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @HillaryClinton The @GOP has a pattern of putting dangerously unqualified candidates on nat'l ticket - Palin, Trump. Time for all GOP to go
792773719085252608 2016-10-30 17:02:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @mattyglesias That wouldn't have been so bad if voters could trust @MSNBC @cnn @washingtonpost @nytpolitics to report accurately
792773300527259649 2016-10-30 17:00:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @EricBoehlert @daveweigel @mmfa weird how Trump's sexual assaults are no longer on @CNN even as more women come forward. Biased much?
792772436475408384 2016-10-30 16:57:32 UTC <Bearnmind> I hope AZ voters remember before that vote that @SenJohnMcCain was willing to put Sarah Palin one heartbeat away from the presidency
792768002437550080 2016-10-30 16:39:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @mattyglesias @MSNBC @cnn and always @FoxNews have done more to erode trust in the media than anything else. Ratings > truth/integrity
792767586241015808 2016-10-30 16:38:16 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey @KellyannePolls your hypocrisy is showing. I sincerely hope Trump ruins your political career. We already have enough liars in politicshttps://twitter.com/stuartpstevens/status/792756915566673920
792767114520190978 2016-10-30 16:36:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @BecketAdams @BostonGlobe @SpeakerRyan crawls out of the hole he's been cowering in from Trump to show he's still a political coward
792766616329216000 2016-10-30 16:34:24 UTC <Bearnmind> This is what @GOP @realDonaldTrump & @KellyannePolls has encouraged & made acceptable. They must be so proud to be the "whites" Candidate https://twitter.com/mbhokie97/status/792528439282589696
792766154393673728 2016-10-30 16:32:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @MELANIATRUMP @KellyannePolls If Trump were elected, you'd go down in history as the person who helped destroy our democracy.
792765406742253568 2016-10-30 16:29:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNPolitics Yet @KellyannePolls is fine with her candidate encouraging this behavior. She is such a hypocrite.
792765164915490818 2016-10-30 16:28:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @KellyannePolls @FoxNews Wow in addition to being a liar, Conway must be psychic since the FBI said they hadn't even read them yet.
792738830679965696 2016-10-30 14:44:00 UTC <Bearnmind> This @GOP cares nothing about doing their constitutional duties or serving the people. They need to be destroyed & rebuilthttps://twitter.com/samsteinhp/status/792734692264910849
792738481135095808 2016-10-30 14:42:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldTrump_Rev Because sexual assault is a "mistake" not a crime?
792738352416092161 2016-10-30 14:42:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump You saying anything dishonest when you're a pathological liar is rich.
792595730133315584 2016-10-29 05:15:22 UTC <Bearnmind> That @KatrinaPierson tried to run for the Senate in 2014 shows she as delusional as Trump. She was blown out (36% to Sessions 63%).
792370047704559616 2016-10-29 14:18:35 UTC <Bearnmind> The narcissism of Donald Trump @CNN http://cnn.it/2eXysZ8

792226753108467713 2016-10-28 04:49:11 UTC <Bearnmind> Not to or from Clinton and basically duplicates of what they already have. I watched @MSNBC & they reported it completely differentlyhttps://twitter.com/jamilsmith/status/792216334864048128
792150707206053889 2016-10-28 23:47:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonfavs @jimsciutto I know. She's apologized for the email thing. This latest thing is just bullshit.
792140288382894081 2016-10-28 23:05:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan @politico if you weren't such a coward & supporting a man who demeans & assaults women, what you say might mean something
792139582246625280 2016-10-28 23:02:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenatorBurr just another embarrassment for the great state of NC. They deserve better #AddSenatorBurrRuinAnythinghttps://twitter.com/therealezway/status/792132001855901696

792089011485564928 2016-10-28 19:41:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @rubycramer Dems always go straight to panic. Most real people have already figured in the whole email thing

792074764022083584 2016-10-28 18:45:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio - He should answer right  after you explain your support for a man you called unqualified & who assaults/demeans women. https://twitter.com/becketadams/status/792074281047957504
792074265369731072 2016-10-28 18:43:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @ajjaffe coming from @marcorubio who won't answer a single question about his support of Trump who assaults & demeans women- hypocritical.
792073907994038272 2016-10-28 18:41:50 UTC <Bearnmind> And @hughhewitt shows yet again how irresponsible he is.https://twitter.com/jonlovett/status/792073244287217664

792072162320547841 2016-10-28 18:34:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol That's not what the letter & subsequent reporting says is happening. I expect Trump to be stupid but not you guys. Words matter
792071519925067776 2016-10-28 18:32:20 UTC <Bearnmind> You can smell the desperation of the @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP to jump on this to change the subject away from Trump & their culpability https://twitter.com/costareports/status/792070682758811649

792067658233614336 2016-10-28 18:17:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @colincampbell @BuzzFeedBen @RobbyMook Well if you can't trust Wikileaks and it's leader (in hiding from a rape charge), who can you trust?

792066782521651200 2016-10-28 18:13:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @mckaycoppins So the FBI is only corrupt when Trump and the @gop doesn't like what they do. This is part of the problem with our politics
792066516678283265 2016-10-28 18:12:28 UTC <Bearnmind> The responsible thing for @MSNBC @CNN is to carefully explain what the letter says. Doubt they will.https://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/792059680520482816
792065138597715973 2016-10-28 18:06:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy he is so pathetic
792040856945561601 2016-10-28 16:30:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @mtaibbi @sfbikelawyer IMHO publishing Wikileaks only encourages more hacks & interference in our election.
792040518108737536 2016-10-28 16:29:09 UTC <Bearnmind> For everyone supporting the theft of Podesta's emails by publishing them - spare us the outrage when you're hacked and it's published

792039489279520769 2016-10-28 16:25:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @TPM The only chance this country has to get a Congress that will legislate & act in the people's interest is if the @gop is voted out. VOTE

791461197438676992 2016-10-26 02:07:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @washingtonpost It's not just Trump alienating women voters. It's @GOP men like @jasoninthehouse who w/their vote say sexual assault is ok
791458453617246208 2016-10-26 01:56:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse by voting for him you're telling women that being sexually assaulted isn't a bad thing. You're disgusting

790389865498210305 2016-10-23 03:10:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP  Remember when Americans trusted Congress & believed Congress served the people? Yeah, me neither.
790389418708336640 2016-10-23 03:08:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @JoePerticone @BuzzFeedBen @amyklobuchar @SenMikeLee don't give them any ideas. @gop loves to waste taxpayer money on useless hearings
790388985524785153 2016-10-23 03:06:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @DevlinBarrett @debilu2 Trust in a free press seems essential for a democracy but I seldom see any reporting on this issue. Why not?
790388700580544512 2016-10-23 03:05:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @CNN @MSNBC @TheFix @chrislhayes @washpo @daveweigel people no longer trust the free press but media doesn't seem to care. What happens now?
790387822532395008 2016-10-23 03:01:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoePerticone @BuzzFeedBen @amyklobuchar @SenMikeLee This is ridiculous tweet. She should know better. She just looks silly
790387486220582913 2016-10-23 03:00:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @WSJ @mattyglesias oh puhlease, this is the media giving credence to more BS. Look at the timeline
790387085748346880 2016-10-23 02:59:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @DevlinBarrett @TheFix This type of crap where credence is given to BS is just one more reason the media is disliked.
790386885986181120 2016-10-23 02:58:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @DevlinBarrett @TheFix I find it hard to believe the media won't try and use this as an October surprise to keep voters interested
790386517902520325 2016-10-23 02:56:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidfrum @oliverdarcy Until @FoxNews dumps Hannity & O'Reilly, they can't be taken seriously as a news organization.
790385479636115456 2016-10-23 02:52:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @CNNPolitics She's been under a microscope for 30 years and this is the best they could find.
790385193668513792 2016-10-23 02:51:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @GaryLegum @NickBaumann @WSJ Just once I'd like the media to point out that this is stupid and not worthy of airtime.
790384759394492416 2016-10-23 02:49:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenMikeLee @amyklobuchar The use of emojis in that tweet was silly.
790378028870299652 2016-10-23 02:23:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @CNN @zeynep @davidfrum @cnn and the media (and voters) are numb now to what's decent, partly due to them and @gop normalizing Trump
790377136708284417 2016-10-23 02:19:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @KFILE @samsteinhp It took a former Buzzfeed reporter to find what @CNN couldn't. Andrew has had Trump's number all election cycle
790365627399766016 2016-10-23 01:33:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @TheWalkingDead just deleted this show off my DVR. Between the stupid cliffhangers & now Glenn, I'm done. #TheWalkingDead
790365230417244160 2016-10-23 01:32:09 UTC <Bearnmind> These stupid cliffhangers and then killing off the one character I loved, I'm so over #TheWalkingDea. Just deleted it off my DVR list.

790331445877301248 2016-10-23 23:17:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNMoney @brianstelter haha. Given Lewandowski and their Trump free air policy, I wonder if a change at CNN wouldn't be a good thing
790331004061904896 2016-10-23 23:16:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger I'm sorry, does Melania Trump have a job I haven't heard about?  Trump is really losing it.

790268157814530048 2016-10-23 19:06:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @TheBudgetGuy @mmurraypolitics @Forbes Either way @SpeakerRyan POTUS aspirations are damaged. Political cowardice has a price.
790267415523393536 2016-10-23 19:03:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm I it is so.
790267096882114560 2016-10-23 19:02:13 UTC <Bearnmind> I have faith that NC voters will dump @PatMcCroryNC for all the damage he's done to the state's image. He should be held accountable
790245418512814080 2016-10-23 17:36:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @mkraju @maggieNYT @deirdrewalshcnn @SpeakerRyan is a political coward who wants it both ways w/Trump & now both sides detest him. Karma.

790013450453999616 2016-10-22 02:14:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @ScottNevins @JPB1213JR see the premise of my tweet was that Benghazi matters more to GOP than Newtown. But thanks for a typical response
789900222671519744 2016-10-22 18:44:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @DineshDSouza You're a small, bitter man who adds nothing to the world. How do you even stand to look at yourself in the mirror.
789899475091333120 2016-10-22 18:41:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @stuartpstevens @ashishanand @JenniferJJacobs worried about his brand. Nothing kills a brand quicker than sexual assault. He deserves it

789847476434038788 2016-10-22 15:14:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire The @GOP politics of divisions & obstructionism is hurting this country. Why can't they put their country over their party?

788913185113923584 2016-10-19 01:22:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller which shows how ignorant he is on this issue
788912862655832064 2016-10-19 01:20:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @HillaryClinton strong defense of roe v wade and women's right to make their health decisions was great #debate2016
788901840956035072 2016-10-19 00:37:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum it's probably already been closed
788888694925262849 2016-10-19 23:44:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @PeteDominick Matthews has become unwatchable, constantly interrupting, not letting anyone answer a question. @msnbc should cancel that show
788875036375539712 2016-10-19 22:50:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoshuaGreen @daveweigel @YouTube @Phil_Mattingly If Trump & Palin occupy the same space, the universe could explode from the vacuum
788874741620891648 2016-10-19 22:49:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @abbydphillip @JasonMillerinDC @peretti I know. It's not like Trump attacks people personally on their looks, weight, etc.
788846010923642881 2016-10-19 20:55:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @joanwalsh @daveweigel It is astonishing how Trump can get so many to publicly humiliate themselves repeatedly
788845322776801280 2016-10-19 20:52:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @washingtonpost @thefix we have the shortest memory ever. All he got was free air during the primaries
788831393115668480 2016-10-19 19:57:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix Every time I hear Trump say drain the swamp, my head hears drain the snake
788830496084074497 2016-10-19 19:53:40 UTC <Bearnmind> Finally @KellyannePolls admits Trump wants to abolish religious freedom in this countryhttps://twitter.com/dandrezner/status/788826517958692866
788829768678506496 2016-10-19 19:50:47 UTC <Bearnmind> again @KatrinaPierson looks foolish. Anyone imagine a serious pol wanting her as a spokesperson? Back to bit parts in bad reality shows. https://twitter.com/olivianuzzi/status/788766723847532544
788815358262145025 2016-10-19 18:53:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @ILANA_ANGEL please send this to Trump. Given his comments about women being fat & ugly, he must not own a mirror
788815070436421632 2016-10-19 18:52:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @DylanByers facts have never stopped Trump surrogates. Damaging the integrity of elections is less important than justifying a Trump loss.

788702983009828864 2016-10-19 11:26:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @CNN Trump assaults women & brags; calls us fat/ugly (does he own a mirror?); women voters crush Trump in election. Poetic Justice.
788701568505942016 2016-10-19 11:21:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @WestWingReport @PaulBegala women have an uncanny BS detector which is why women will save this country from Trump

788590187634982913 2016-10-18 03:58:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @jmartNYT @StuPolitics @dshesgreen Weird how @robportman changes his positions when it's politically expedient.
788589789578747905 2016-10-18 03:57:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger Why isn't anyone reporting that @people has a witness to the Melania encounter on the street that she said never happened?
788589446761512964 2016-10-18 03:55:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @thehill Is this the criminal who made the doctored planned parenthood tapes? Because of course he can be trusted
788588688942956544 2016-10-18 03:52:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter You just know the "news" part of @FoxNews makes fun of @seanhannity behind his back. That must be why he's such a hateful ass
788588239041007616 2016-10-18 03:51:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @FoxNews EVP thinks  people's opinion of them as Faux News has changed? Lol They're twisted entertainment, not real news
788587535190659072 2016-10-18 03:48:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol Great, I guess we'll get to hear more men saying awful things about women. He thinks women need that
788569212633612291 2016-10-18 02:35:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @DylanByers @oliverdarcy I have to say  I'm suspicious of Wallace because he works at @foxnews. Why would any legit journalist work there?
788534847132332033 2016-10-18 00:18:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @AC360 why is the arrival of Trump's plan in Las Vegas newsworthy. No matter how Zucker tries to deny it, @cnn's coverage helped Trump
788527024931561472 2016-10-18 23:47:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @people So Melania Trump lied when she said she never talked to your writer on the street. Runs in the family I guess
788526391121838080 2016-10-18 23:45:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump - a racist, small man who sexually assaults women who will be overwhelmingly rejected by this great nation #StopWhining

788524910540886016 2016-10-18 23:39:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @SopanDeb I'm betting it's the other way-people who say they're voting Trump but aren't. They just terrified of his cult fanatics
788524639282663424 2016-10-18 23:38:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @jamestaranto you have got to be tired of explaining how journalism/free press work. I feel for you but you're doing a great job

788523736618131456 2016-10-18 23:34:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger 4 adult men went to Libya & were tragically killed; 20 children went to school & were murdered. @GOP cares only about the men
788523018691735552 2016-10-18 23:31:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain @HouseGOP @SenateGOP put their own interests and party over the people's well-being and the country. They aren't fit to lead

788522335347286016 2016-10-18 23:29:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonathanchait @BraddJaffy @KatyTurNBC Every time the @GOP says Benghazi, the Dems should shout Newtown. Zero action, zero hearings

788464526824005633 2016-10-18 19:39:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger the one thing I agree with Trump on / term limits. I hate myself

788344784494661632 2016-10-18 11:43:38 UTC <Bearnmind> The sad thing about this election cycle is that I look at the few people I know who support Trump differently now.
788343751496364033 2016-10-18 11:39:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Lol @JoeMSNBC is really working hard today to try & secure a spot with Trump's soon to be TV network.
788339011983138816 2016-10-18 11:20:41 UTC <Bearnmind> And now @morningmika talks about "condescending media" like she & Joe aren't part of that? I wish @MSNBC would get a new morning show crew
788338572281675776 2016-10-18 11:18:56 UTC <Bearnmind> Given that @JoeMSNBC gave unlimited free air to Trump, how hypocritical to accuse media of being biased. Joe trying to crawl back to Trump?
788338135310761984 2016-10-18 11:17:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix Great to see @TheFix call out @JoeMSNBC on his BS assertion that media has been unfair. Asked for proof & Joe folded and diverted.
788337157081600000 2016-10-18 11:13:19 UTC <Bearnmind> Weird how @JoeMSNBC seems to exclude himself when talking about out-of-touch elites, millionaire ex congressman turned TV shill.

788328887692451840 2016-10-18 10:40:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Trump has everyone shilling for him on Morning Joe; poor Dems have @morningmika & she's poor at best. It's painful to watch
788328278419537921 2016-10-18 10:38:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC the level of outrage on any issue on Morning Joe is proportional to the party involved. If GOP - an error; if Dems - corruption

788184304065085440 2016-10-17 01:05:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNPolitics I see why you hired Lewandowski. He's uniquely qualified to explain the mind of a man who assaults women & lies about it.
788183190716477440 2016-10-17 01:01:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN Every time I see Corey Lewandowski on, I change the channel
788181902800855040 2016-10-17 00:56:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @BenjySarlin It's jarring to hear her say that given that Trump is a bully & says tweets awful things. But that's ok cuz he's just a boy?
788181450776608768 2016-10-17 00:54:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @AC360 quite the disconnect with your pundit panel on Melania's interview and my house. We watched it & thought she didn't help at all
788178127742701569 2016-10-17 00:41:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @BecketAdams Clearly in her eyes, all women are asking for it
788177945642795008 2016-10-17 00:40:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @JonLemire well that makes sexual assault ok then I guess, after all he's just being a boy. I don't think she came off well at all
788177696274735104 2016-10-17 00:39:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @AC360 @ac360 based on what Melania Trump said some man kissing her or grabbing her by the p***y wouldn't be sexual assault. Yeah, right
788176631475032064 2016-10-17 00:35:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @AC360 I was offended by Melania Trump's attempt to shame the women. Check their background? Grabbing a woman by the p***y isn't assault?
788176241480183808 2016-10-17 00:33:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @AC360  the media says Melania Trump is a good surrogate for Trump. I find her unbelievable & at the very least in denial about who he is
788165115283636224 2016-10-17 23:49:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio - still voting for Trump despite being publicly humiliated, stating he isn't qualified & his sexual assaults. What a hypocrite

788153409807474689 2016-10-17 23:03:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter Maybe he's learned that laughing when someone brags about assaulting women doesn't end well.
788153083020845057 2016-10-17 23:01:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm @DrJillStein I wish she would go away. No one is listening to her
788152944776675328 2016-10-17 23:01:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter A @realDonaldTrump network will be broke in 2 years. American's attn span = gnat, esp if he loses big. Americans  losers

788150763834974210 2016-10-17 22:52:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @Acosta And it's hard for people to understand distrust for law enforcement? My husband was a cop, he was outraged when he hear this
788150130922913793 2016-10-17 22:50:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire My husband is from Ohio. I'm going to have to ask him what the hell is wrong with his state?

788149434324492288 2016-10-17 22:47:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix In today's political climate, would a 9 point margin be considered a landslide?
788149188982935552 2016-10-17 22:46:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @StuPolitics @CahnEmily it's disappointing to see @MarkHalperin go from a journalist to a hack. Fame went to his head evidently
788148718746959872 2016-10-17 22:44:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @thinkprogress @JuddLegum if the voters want anything accomplished, the Senate needs to be Dems. The @GOP cares only about obstructionism
788068998042755073 2016-10-17 17:27:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnMcCain I sincerely hope you lose. This stmt is BS. You're just an obstructionist.https://twitter.com/phil_mattingly/status/788061070212685828

787781561550827520 2016-10-16 22:25:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan You've been publicly humiliated & vilified by Trump. You know he would be disastrous & you still support him. You deserve himhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/787758668565581824
787780572324196353 2016-10-16 22:21:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @Mediaite Generally when a politician has to resign in disgrace, he shuts the hell up. What did we do to deserve more of @newtgingrich?

787505113648750592 2016-10-15 04:07:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @nypost @KellyannePolls You're unbelievable. Throwing all women under the bus to support a misogynist who sexually assaults women.
787504523766104064 2016-10-15 04:04:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @ron_fournier @SpeakerRyan Ryan is a coward who supports a racist who assaults women. He owns Trump. Party over country is Ryan's way
787503660255309825 2016-10-15 04:01:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNPolitics The Senate should censure @jeffsessions for his comments. He is a craven political coward trying to undermine our democracy.
787490552652656641 2016-10-15 03:09:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @MattOrtega @BuzzFeedBen @EmmyA2 He's a small, insecure man. That's why @realDonaldTrump always someone or something else for being a loser
787467290023432192 2016-10-15 01:36:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @hollybdc @jeffsessions I'm ashamed you're an American. Casting doubt on the legitimacy of our democratic elections for political gain. F.U.
787466856487645184 2016-10-15 01:35:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @PageSix @BuzzFeedBen @fmanjoo I was wrong about Billy Bush. Donating his exit pay is an amazing thing to do. Good on him
787259497429344256 2016-10-15 11:51:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @RogerJStoneJr that's a different woman.  You're even more of an idiot than I thought possible.

787136199148183552 2016-10-14 03:41:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump As his humiliation deepens & his personal brand is further tarnished, he seems intent only on degrading American politicshttps://twitter.com/maggienyt/status/787134943704952832

787071159544053761 2016-10-14 23:22:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @heytana so you're good with sexual assault as long as the assaulter apologizes. You're a disgrace to all women

786892768526278658 2016-10-14 11:33:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @BuzzFeedBen @politico @gop frantically trying to act like they didn't nominate a sexual predator. After all it's just women being attacked
786892240891195392 2016-10-14 11:31:44 UTC <Bearnmind> Does Trump have dirt on @JoeMSNBC?  He is desperately insisting Trump can win because he isn't losing by as much as he should be
786890625928994818 2016-10-14 11:25:19 UTC <Bearnmind> Hmm @AriFleischer playing dumb about Trump's turn toward anti-semitism on @MSNBC. Is he that blind or just a political coward?
786883581431775232 2016-10-14 10:57:20 UTC <Bearnmind> Watching @JoeMSNBC & some of crew on desperately compare hidden Trump voters to Brexit vote is painful. @MSNBC should consider a new host
786879449098706945 2016-10-14 10:40:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoeMSNBC working overtime this morning to shill for Trump. Not a word about the crazy Trump is throwing out or the sexual assault charges

786651785524051968 2016-10-13 19:36:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @bi_politics @PeteDominick and people wonder why women don't come forward. If @FoxNews was a legitimate org they would fire @LouDobbs
786618222061637632 2016-10-13 17:22:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @LouDobbs is a poor example of a man but an excellent example of the lack of character in the men that work for @foxnewshttps://twitter.com/jbarro/status/786616401893220352

786414374646714368 2016-10-12 03:52:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN having your paid pundit @CLewandowski_ a proven liar when it comes to assaulting women basically calling the women liars is bizarrehttps://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/786412969924100096

786406080951701508 2016-10-12 03:19:55 UTC <Bearnmind> Unbelievable. @AJDelgado13 just said on @MSNBC that even if you believe that Trump assaulted these women it shouldn't affect your vote.

786398231257153536 2016-10-12 02:48:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm it seems important to note that these women came forward in May with these allegations before the tape was made public

786356545521057792 2016-10-12 00:03:04 UTC <Bearnmind> Watching @realDonaldTrump go down in flames & make a fool of himself in the process is strangely satisfying.

786355387830247424 2016-10-12 23:58:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @MGM_Studios has tapes that could impact who is elected for the most powerful position in the world & is hiding behind artists rights?https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/786354197763620864
786352841275432962 2016-10-12 23:48:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @KellyannePolls @HillaryClinton You defend a man who brags about sexual assault. You're a hypocrite
786352417369653248 2016-10-12 23:46:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @SopanDeb You have to wonder if Trump & @mike_pence have ever had an actual conversation. Trump is making Pence look like a fool
786351857098756097 2016-10-12 23:44:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidfrum @BraddJaffy lucky for @mike_pence he decided he was going to stick like glue to Trump.
786348524518670336 2016-10-12 23:31:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm you know it has to be true. He projects whatever he says or does onto someone else: unfit, unqualified, unhinged

786272271153319936 2016-10-12 18:28:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @anamariecox a Pres Trump will get rid of that pesky & unnecessary 1st amendment and @FoxNews will officially be state media
786271926482145280 2016-10-12 18:26:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeed Giuliani's transformation into a conspiracy crazed, lying clown is now complete.

786252584096890880 2016-10-12 17:09:58 UTC <Bearnmind> Given the sensitivity right now of police & race, showing support for a racist while in uniform was shockingly offensivehttps://twitter.com/breaking911/status/786249792619999232
786234114386964480 2016-10-12 15:56:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenJohnThune = political coward & hypocrite. Voting for Trump and yet again putting party before the good of the countryhttps://twitter.com/politicalwire/status/786225224907788288

785860639805870084 2016-10-11 15:12:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump free to just let loose with the racism, misogyny, idiocy
785860155460161536 2016-10-11 15:10:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol @ChrisChristie realizes the damage he's done to this career and image w/Trump. It's too late to rehab his image. Trump's lapdog
785686875595878404 2016-10-10 03:42:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro @davidplouffe In Trump's world, Putin is a friend but African Americans/Hispanics are the enemy. It's revolting & terrifying
785686102409486336 2016-10-10 03:38:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN will pay the price for their lack of integrity after the election. The Trump News Network that CNN has become is a train wreckhttps://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/785684645266370560

785676781332275200 2016-10-10 03:01:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @JakeSherman yet @MarshaBlackburn offered quite the defense. Throwing women under the bus seems to be a common thread among @gop women

785674315895181314 2016-10-10 02:52:08 UTC <Bearnmind> That @realDonaldTrump is easily duped & played by Russia is no surprise. What's terrifying is that he then dupes his supporters.https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/785663294417752064
785670134346035201 2016-10-10 02:35:31 UTC <Bearnmind> Listening to @MarshaBlackburn defend Trump is sickening. How does she live with herself.

785637927015460868 2016-10-10 00:27:32 UTC <Bearnmind> What gives @MGM_Studios? Release the tapes. Women have huge buying power in case you forgot. Protecting Trump=PR nightmare #ComeCleanMGMhttps://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/785634322627829761
785637192861220865 2016-10-10 00:24:37 UTC <Bearnmind> I guess @MGM_Studios would rather be associated with sexual assault rather than release Apprentice tapes #ComeCleanMGM

785615254134722560 2016-10-10 22:57:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @ryanstruyk @JohnJHarwood Telling that the question has clearly been asked many times
785614986731139072 2016-10-10 22:56:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @mike_pence You're as disgusting as Trump
785614444390780928 2016-10-10 22:54:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @MGM_Studios keeping Trump tapes secret is akin to condoning his behavior and actions. You are condoning sexual assault- not a good look
785613152595562496 2016-10-10 22:49:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @utgop_james @realDonaldTrump @UtahGOP Come to Utah where sexual assault is just locker room talk.

785539114913325056 2016-10-10 17:54:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @JakeSherman @realDonaldTrump It's telling that Trump talks about himself in the 3rd person. I honestly wish wonder if he isn't mentally ill
785514319706361856 2016-10-10 16:16:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @mike_pence proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with a man who sexually assaults women.  Kiss 2020 hopes goodbye. Women have long memories
785513682381922304 2016-10-10 16:13:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan had a chance to show courage, he once again displayed cowardice. Ryan only has principles when it suits him. He's a hypocrite
785452342095339520 2016-10-10 12:10:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoeMSNBC & @morningmika back on their knees defending a man who sexually assaults women. Their admiration of Trump is revolting
785449633287802880 2016-10-10 11:59:20 UTC <Bearnmind> 13 times Trump was dead wrong at the debate, and 2 times Clinton was http://politi.co/2dJcKsr

785326302937030656 2016-10-09 03:49:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @ABCPolitics @maggieNYT @Reince Reince should focus his attention on his candidate who sexually assaults women. His house is burning

784936610299248640 2016-10-08 02:00:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire At the end of this election, he will walk away a loser with a damaged brand & hated by the majority of the country.

784931379335364608 2016-10-08 01:39:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @HuffPostPol they're ok with racism, misogyny, xenophobia but this was a bridge too far? What hypocrites. I'm never voting @GOP again
784931039173115904 2016-10-08 01:38:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @samsteinhp guess @mike_pence principles outweighed by his desperation to be the VP of a man who sexually assaults women because he's a star
784924371953520640 2016-10-08 01:12:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @BrentNYT @joshtpm @Sulliview Gotta agree that @NBCNews doesn't look good in this.
784924159050649600 2016-10-08 01:11:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnBoozman Your words are hollow since you still support a man who brags about sexual assault. Explain that to the women in your life
784923853608873984 2016-10-08 01:10:04 UTC <Bearnmind> Where's @Reince and his snappy tweets?  Hiding like the coward he is? He'll go down in history as the Chairman who destroyed the @GOP
784923276669779968 2016-10-08 01:07:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan Crude but true. You should be used to this language given that you lack the backbone or principles to stand up to Trumphttps://twitter.com/timkmak/status/784922643895988224
784876970278424576 2016-10-08 22:03:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro which probably just pisses women off even more

784876594565447680 2016-10-08 22:02:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm @igorbobic The only one who cares about Cruz's endorsement is Cruz. He's toast, has always been toast.
784876237915291648 2016-10-08 22:00:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @CynthiaLummis way to show political cowardice. Vote for a man who degrades and assaults women.

784579974577750017 2016-10-07 02:23:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix So if Trump does well in the debate, they'll still support him. Oh yeah, the way Trump treats women really bothers them. Hypocrites
784574316469972992 2016-10-07 02:01:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio Such a hypocrite. You're supporting for him so no matter how hard you try, you condone his words with your vote.
784573582982676480 2016-10-07 01:58:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm @JohnJHarwood - @ChrisHayesTV said this would happen on his show tonight. Even the reason Trump would give.  Is he psychic?

784572033367674880 2016-10-07 01:52:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @reidepstein if @SpeakerRyan still supports Trump after this, he is in effect condoning what Trump said & WI women should take notice

783499917843202049 2016-10-04 02:51:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix So Pence won because he was calmer and lied well.

783483727703838721 2016-10-04 01:47:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix there's so much to work with. There isn't a clear winner, it's going to be R's say Pence; Dems say Kaine.

783258973403308032 2016-10-04 10:54:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @RogerJStoneJr it's not surprising that you worship Assange but never mention he's in hiding to avoid a rape charge.
783258421315375104 2016-10-04 10:52:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @jessesingal @daveweigel @intelligencer Assange is hiding from a rape charge. Media should include that in any mention of him. He's no hero
783257563274108928 2016-10-04 10:48:49 UTC <Bearnmind> You can correlate how Trump is doing in the polls based on the level of groveling the @Morning_Joe crew does, particularly @morningmika
783254062502449152 2016-10-04 10:34:55 UTC <Bearnmind> Has anyone else noticed how @morningmika has become so sanctimonious? I'm all for women in TV, but she is difficult to root for.

773916728782970880 2016-09-08 16:11:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro @ClaraJeffery Trump displays ignorance and shows he knows nothing everyday and look where it got him. Don't give up hope Gary
773916245288710144 2016-09-08 16:09:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller But true. @MLauer did himself & the country a disservice last night. I'll never look at him the same way again.
773915942044794882 2016-09-08 16:08:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @BraddJaffy I thought nothing in those intelligence briefings is supposed to be leaked. Oh right, it's Trump, intelligence doesn't apply
773915550644838400 2016-09-08 16:07:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics And Trump could care less what @SpeakerRyan says or thinks. To Trump he's just an annoying little gnat to be swatted away
773915313540886528 2016-09-08 16:06:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro @SabrinaSiddiqui Maybe when the "freedom caucus" pushes @SpeakerRyan out, he'll have time to find his spine...and his principles
773914876662218752 2016-09-08 16:04:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum and every journalist on Twitter has mentioned it so they accomplished their purpose
773914757954932736 2016-09-08 16:03:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @wjcarter @brianstelter I beg to differ on @MLauer interviewing skills. He whiffed on Lochte and was terrible last night
773914496649789440 2016-09-08 16:02:49 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey @MLauer I was disappointed with the double-standard you showed. Are you afraid of Trump or just rude to womenhttps://twitter.com/normornstein/status/773684804009226240
773914001554173952 2016-09-08 16:00:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @oliverdarcy @FoxNews And now based on rumors and lies, the press is going to validate more BS.

773913045869494272 2016-09-08 15:57:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @SabrinaSiddiqui @maggieNYT @SpeakerRyan Maybe he should give his presidential candidate a heads up on that. Evidently they're Besties
773912475087626249 2016-09-08 15:54:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire whoever at @NBCNews selected @MLauer, clearly out of his depth & as clearly biased, should be fired
773911042208530432 2016-09-08 15:49:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump You wish. Politicfact rated 71% of what you said last night as lies. Hey you're getting a number close to Putin's 82%

773888346364018688 2016-09-08 14:18:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @grynbaum @brianstelter I'm glad she raised it. It's been so blatant it deserves attention and the media needs to do better esp @nytimes

773713075782443008 2016-09-07 02:42:26 UTC <Bearnmind> my Twitter feed - @MLauer was terrible; America lost; Trump lied; @NBCNews @MSNBC credibility took another hit in their quest for ratings
773712181141602304 2016-09-07 02:38:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @McMcbillion43 20 1st graders got slaughtered and @HouseGOP held zero hearings & did nothing about it.
773711892275658752 2016-09-07 02:37:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @Domer1979 I think he thinks POTUS is a dictatorship and he's staging a coup
773710606117572609 2016-09-07 02:32:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @NBCNews um not @MLauer, total softballs to Trump, no follow-up/unchallenged lies..again. But you weren't after substance, just ratings
773709519121747968 2016-09-07 02:28:18 UTC <Bearnmind> Trump graded on a huge curve, Hillary criticized for not smiling. No double standard here.https://twitter.com/justinbarasky/status/773706194859024384
773709249075679233 2016-09-07 02:27:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @JDiamond1 @brianstelter @NBCNews a real opportunity to provide voters with more info but @MLauer blew it. Next time get a journalist

773708569158049793 2016-09-07 02:24:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd I know you're paid to say that plus ratings! but the country didn't gain anything because @MLauer just let Trump lie again
773708117775351808 2016-09-07 02:22:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd I'm sure you'll make sure it appears they had exactly the same level of criticism and responded exactly the same way

773706572518289409 2016-09-07 02:16:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @Reince You're either delusional or desperately trying to justify selling out your country by trying to electing a racist
773706235766050816 2016-09-07 02:15:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @mattyglesias @msnbc Matt Lauer proved he's not a journalist tonight, just a TV host. Which begs the question, why was he selected?
773705247436963840 2016-09-07 02:11:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @Reince @HillaryClinton smile? Reince is a misogynistic dick
773549763698515969 2016-09-07 15:53:30 UTC <Bearnmind> Since "Jim Crowe"'is taken, what will @realDonaldTrump call his laws if he gets elected?
773548837348712448 2016-09-07 15:49:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix not surprising, Trump@has a lot of empty space in his head to fill

773548172115316736 2016-09-07 15:47:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @SopanDeb I don't know Bill, all I've done is make racists remarks, refuse to disavow alt-right but I went to 1 black church.
773547637022810112 2016-09-07 15:45:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @BWilliams @11thHour @costareports I guess you drew the short straw
773547533524168704 2016-09-07 15:44:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews Is no line too far for you? Sexual harassment & now @seanhannity supporting Assange whose hiding to avoid a rape trial
773546168244641792 2016-09-07 15:39:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler @RosieGray of course @seanhannity has sympathy for him, it's not like he's in hiding to avoid being tried for rape
773544337158332417 2016-09-07 15:31:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd @randalusa Thank you but no. I've drawn my own conclusions based on what I've heard from him.
773544060711763968 2016-09-07 15:30:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @SopanDeb I think you 2 have done a good job coving the election but it's telling how poorly media takes criticism.
773543440688742401 2016-09-07 15:28:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd Also strange how @MSNBC @CNN don't think they're doing anything wrong. Maybe the media needs to do an autopsy of their coverage
773542837199732736 2016-09-07 15:25:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP @CNN @MSNBC need to turn a critical eye toward their own coverage of this election. They should be embarrassed by what they see
773542409791741953 2016-09-07 15:24:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd It must be hard to validate a racist/bigot's campaign for ratings. You may not see it that way but viewers do
773542037303992320 2016-09-07 15:22:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @LOLGOP true for Trump lapdogs @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @nytpolitics but @BuzzFeedAndrew @SopanDeb @mattyglesias have done their jobs well
773480991990149120 2016-09-07 11:20:13 UTC <Bearnmind> It still amazes me that the death of 4 Americans was more important to @HouseGOP than slaughter of 20 1st gradershttps://twitter.com/mikegrunwald/status/773480465613266944

771117900329525248 2016-08-31 22:50:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix so he must have meant different Mexicans when he called then all criminals and rapists
771115939156852736 2016-08-31 22:42:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbouie @joshtpm @jimantle And who has set those low expectations? That would be the media. Double standard much?

771115077420417024 2016-08-31 22:38:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @amyewalter @chucktodd How low is the standard the media has for Trump that just being polite is considered an achievement?
771108628086530048 2016-08-31 22:13:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle you're delusional.

771108050858086400 2016-08-31 22:11:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @GovMikeHuckabee haha. You made a joke. Trump's a joke too. Hardly presidential no matter how much you'd like it to be true

770948605507141632 2016-08-31 11:37:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @AaronBlake @thefix Most people don't like the media but somehow that's not a news story. We don't really have journalists now just pundits
770948367073632256 2016-08-31 11:36:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @AaronBlake These stories are click bait. No real news value just a lazy story for journalists.
770948263101038592 2016-08-31 11:36:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @AaronBlake I don't like most politicians but all I care about is who will do a good job. In this case, that's HRC.

770743324990906368 2016-08-30 22:01:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @SopanDeb but Lewandowski works for @CNN right? Surely CNN wouldn't hire a partisan back still getting paid by Trump as a pundit.
770641472295202816 2016-08-30 15:16:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire @HouseGOP @SenateGOP we set such low standards for politicians, 80 yro men w/no new ideas, racists, cowards, etc

768442109187743744 2016-08-24 13:37:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics I wish someone would take a look at Congress. Their donors get meetings, new laws, and appropriations. Hypocrites all

768420612280815616 2016-08-24 12:12:05 UTC <Bearnmind> the @GOP and cowardly @Reince have given white nationalists, racists and bigots a loud voice in a political party. History won't be kind

767887726448373761 2016-08-22 00:54:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @Wonkette @DoktorZoom Don't believe something is true just because Fox News said it. Do your own research, become informed.
767887348864614400 2016-08-22 00:53:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @Wonkette @DoktorZoom PP was found to have done nothing wrong, unlike the guys who were indicted

767881367938105345 2016-08-22 00:29:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix It's painful to realize all the hidden bigotry and racism that Trump has made it ok to say openly has existed all along.

767768070655975424 2016-08-22 16:59:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @stuartpstevens @SopanDeb @KellyannePolls is trading her self-respect for an unqualified demagogue who would destroy our country.
767767145614901250 2016-08-22 16:55:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @thefix @byamberphillips this is not a bad thing. @gop is no longer a national party. It must be destroyed so it can be rebuilt.
767766632676618240 2016-08-22 16:53:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins Because the @SenateGOP and @JeffFlake have done so much for the people to date. These guys put party before country always.
767766171605147648 2016-08-22 16:51:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias that's despicable.
767765776002580480 2016-08-22 16:50:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @brianstelter it's somewhat ironic that @JoeMSNBC seemed to be peachy keen when Trump attacked Megan Kelly.

766775327595040769 2016-08-19 23:14:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @SopanDeb It is astounding supporters blame media for twisting Trump's words just by reporting them word for word.

766772294043787265 2016-08-19 23:02:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm @politico @realDonaldTrump It is terrifying how delusional Trump is. We're looking at mental illness/personality disorder here
766771883635269632 2016-08-19 23:00:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @joshtpm It's always someone else's fault. The one constant in the disaster that is the Trump campaign is @realDonaldTrump.
766771567133069312 2016-08-19 22:59:22 UTC <Bearnmind> IMO our problem is the white @HouseGOP @SenateGOP who grew up during Jim Crow. People don't change & they don't reflect the diversity of US
766770815421612032 2016-08-19 22:56:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @costareports Trump is the candidate for all the things that we're trying to change in this country - bigotry, racism, misogyny
766770582109192192 2016-08-19 22:55:27 UTC <Bearnmind> Expressing "regret" doesn't suddenly make @realDonaldTrump fit/qualified to be POTUS. That's the fundamental problem for him. He's neither
766770224045621248 2016-08-19 22:54:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump thinks we'll forget how he doubled down on racist/bigoted comments instead of apologizing when he thought he was winning
766769643075887104 2016-08-19 22:51:43 UTC <Bearnmind> I find it insulting that @realDonaldTrump  thinks voters will forget that he only expressed "regret" when it was clear he was losing badly

766603210014547968 2016-08-19 11:50:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @Morning_Joe serious question. You give reasons why Syria hasn't worked. What experience do you have that gave you expertise in this area?
766599784169926657 2016-08-19 11:36:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP they'd slam him for not using the money as leverage if he had released the money before the prisoners were released. I'm sick of @GOP

760314286958837760 2016-08-01 03:20:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @PaulBegala It has to grate on @realDonaldTrump that the truly self-made billionaires think he's a joke.

760312890058473472 2016-08-01 03:14:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Its unheard for a Republican Candidate to be such a loser at fundraising. Good job.https://twitter.com/buzzfeedandrew/status/760307089671675904

760287485989679105 2016-08-01 01:33:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN sold-out your credibility by ass-kissing Trump, hiring thug/paid Trump Shill @CLewandowski_ and Trump is still dogging you on Twitter.
760286884790763524 2016-08-01 01:31:33 UTC <Bearnmind> I can't even watch @AC360 on @CNN with @CLewandowski_ on it. The man is a paid Trump shill who makes no intelligent contribution.

737461923197923328 2016-05-30 01:53:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @Bravotv @bravotv This is my last episode of #SouthernCharm. I can't watch/condone repeated bullying of one woman by an entire cast. TV at its worst
737460297355649028 2016-05-30 01:46:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @Pataltschul @cameraneubanks @ClementsLandon aren't ladies, They're just women desperate for reality TV fame & money #SouthernCharm
737458787574022145 2016-05-30 01:40:50 UTC <Bearnmind> Without money it's doubtful that @ClementsLandon would want Shep. Grow some self-respect girl.  Your desperation is showing #SouthernCharm
737457853754179584 2016-05-30 01:37:08 UTC <Bearnmind> Seriously @Bravotv even for reality TV, hell even for trash TV, the bullying   In #SouthernCharm being condoned by you is unacceptable
737457243713593345 2016-05-30 01:34:42 UTC <Bearnmind> 2) liar kicked out of office for drugs who used a 21 yro to "get an heir". No morals or principles yet they judge her. #SouthernCharm
737456544472764416 2016-05-30 01:31:56 UTC <Bearnmind> 1) @Pataltschul @cameraneubanks @ClementsLandon are the worst type of women. Judging/slut shaming Kathryn but not the 50 yro #SouthernCharm

737452716654485504 2016-05-30 01:16:43 UTC <Bearnmind> If it weren't for cruel bullying of Kathryn none of this cast would have a storyline. @cameraneubanks you should be ashamed #SouthernCharm
737452243465719809 2016-05-30 01:14:50 UTC <Bearnmind> You just know Patricia had to pay kids to be Whitney's friends. Seriously creepy.  #SouthernCharm
737451689205235716 2016-05-30 01:12:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @Bravotv The cast of #SouthernCharm has lost what little charm they had. The bullying attacks on Kathryn are reprehensible, not good TV.

727672237558513664 2016-05-03 01:32:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix Perhaps the media will find their spine now when it comes to Trump but sadly I doubt it.
727672063918542849 2016-05-03 01:31:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @daveweigel The @gop racist, bigoted obstructionism helped create Trump and put in peril the country they profess to love. Hypocrites.
727671522857525248 2016-05-03 01:29:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire the problem with the media in this race. They find "bigly" and evidently misogyny amusing  not deeply troubling
727671128953655296 2016-05-03 01:28:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix Lets see if @tedcruz sticks by his rhetoric. I predict he won't and will support Trump.
727670762295984128 2016-05-03 01:26:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedNews @BuzzFeedBen It's not like the @GOP presidential candidate should be smart, knowledgable, honest or trustworthy.

727330604166033408 2016-05-02 02:55:03 UTC <Bearnmind> Harsh rejection by @cameraneubanks. What's happened to her? Guess nice want getting her enough air time. A shame  https://twitter.com/shannelle/status/727328046609534980

727109403502120961 2016-05-02 12:16:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @MSNBC Wny hasn't the media pointed out that Trump's primary support is 10 million votes out of 300 million people.
727108610162081792 2016-05-02 12:12:56 UTC <Bearnmind> Evidently @realDonaldTrump supporters have decided that a dictatorship is preferable to a democracy
727105447912718336 2016-05-02 12:00:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @wpjenna @brianstelter In this I agree with Trump, you can no longer trust the media to properly report anything, esp. @CNN or @MSNBC
727104923473694725 2016-05-02 11:58:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @CNN You have 1 job - to provide unbiased election coverage and you've blown it. Cable "news" is now an oxymoron and a punch line
727104376561647617 2016-05-02 11:56:06 UTC <Bearnmind> If only @chucktodd had the guts to confront Trump the way he did Cruz on MTP Sunday. The deference towards Trump on @MSNBC is astonishing

710195175486832641 2016-03-16 20:04:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @Reince is such a coward. Trump is tearing apart the party and Reince is too scared to say or do anything. Foreshadowing?
710194293093376001 2016-03-16 20:01:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @DailyCaller And @realDonaldTrump plagiarizes as well as lies.  Is anyone surprised?
710174972057149440 2016-03-16 18:44:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @cindogg88 @Breaking911 @realDonaldTrump um yeah, 35% of 35% of mostly GOO voters. More vote against him than for him.
710174527976824833 2016-03-16 18:42:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @lbarronlopez @samsteinhp So he has an egotistical idiot as his primary advisor. Good to know
710174383348776960 2016-03-16 18:42:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @cindogg88 @Breaking911 @realDonaldTrump But the polls that have him ahead also done by media are true? Can't have it both ways
710174220588814336 2016-03-16 18:41:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @NYCPiper @Breaking911 @realDonaldTrump Just the truth
710157030376529921 2016-03-16 17:33:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @essie and your website shows them as all sold out
710156813522567168 2016-03-16 17:32:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @essie but you show 8 bottles
710156715111612416 2016-03-16 17:32:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @essie how many bottles are there in the watercolor set? Amazon has six bottles in 2 kits
710154083416588288 2016-03-16 17:21:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @essie why are they showing as sold out
710153560093282304 2016-03-16 17:19:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @KThomasDC @SenateMajLdr will only give a voice to GOP voters who will vote in this election. History will not be kind to him
710153122832891904 2016-03-16 17:17:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @TODAYshow these lemming supporters will be the ones screwed over by Trump and will be shocked when it happens.
710151827417915392 2016-03-16 17:12:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenToomey you're willing to risk your job, defy the constitution and the people's vote in 2012. You shouldn't be a Senator. #DoYourJob
710151371476090882 2016-03-16 17:10:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @SenToomey @BuzzFeedAndrew The country hates congress. You are trying to nullify the people's vote in 2012. What a hypocrite  #DoYourJob

710150326427525120 2016-03-16 17:06:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire @realDonaldTrump is representing 35% of 35% of @GOP voters. Clinton has received more votes than him.
710150068708503552 2016-03-16 17:05:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire Refuses to release taxes, names of advisors, debate, renounce violence. Oh yeah, he'd be great for the country
710149749492547584 2016-03-16 17:04:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @nytpolitics so he's threatening the @GOP. Can't wait to see how they and @Reince cower before Supreme Leader Trump.
710149163724500992 2016-03-16 17:02:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @politicalwire @Senate_GOPs The country hates the @GOP and you for crap like this.  The people voted in 2012. #DoYourJob
710148854440660996 2016-03-16 17:00:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @senorrinhatch @PaulBegala @SenOrrinHatch the only good thing about Trump is watching him bully @gop.
710148565759299586 2016-03-16 16:59:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @Breaking911 So basically 65% of the country was disappointed since that's how many view @realDonaldTrump unfavorably.
710148157410287616 2016-03-16 16:58:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @gwenifill the last debate put @realDonaldTrump ignorance of policy & lack of understanding of the office on full display.
710147782485680128 2016-03-16 16:56:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @SpeakerRyan @JohnJHarwood They don't have a right to refuse to do their job. You're as bad as the rest & y'all are shocked by the hatred
710072690040823808 2016-03-16 11:58:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @lbarronlopez @samsteinhp Terrifying. Trump's ego wont let him acknowledge what he doesn't know because his ego thinks he knows everything
710071749833003009 2016-03-16 11:54:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidaxelrod @politicalwire @realDonaldTrump @GOP If they care at all about the country & their party, they'll grow a spine and do it
710071418000543745 2016-03-16 11:53:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew On @Morning_Joe - Who are you talking to about foreign policy? Trump -I'm talking to myself. I have a very good brain. Scary
710071001619554304 2016-03-16 11:51:33 UTC <Bearnmind> In @Morning_Joe Joe/Mika and @MarkHalperin kowtowing to Trump again & not calling him out on his lies. Mark used to be one of my favorites
710069201113882625 2016-03-16 11:44:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP best-deny Trump nom at convention citing bigotry, divisiveness & show minorities you care. Put country before party but keep your party
710066904191385606 2016-03-16 11:35:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @davidaxelrod @ZekeJMiller @NewDay @ChrisCuomo @realDonaldTrump Trump is on a massive campaign to validate his self-worth.
710066627866451968 2016-03-16 11:34:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNPolitics @brianstelter Ironic that he's been the nasty one.
710066114487820290 2016-03-16 11:32:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP don't underestimate the core decency of the American people. They will reject a party w/leader who is a bigot, misogynist and xenophobe
710065295323430912 2016-03-16 11:28:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP Now we get to see if you value country over party. If you endorse Trump, it's party and the GOP is dead.

709894581534527489 2016-03-15 00:10:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @politicalwire Do you just sit around tallying how often your name is mentioned or do you hire people to do it.
709894363518779393 2016-03-15 00:09:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins also sounds like he ran over a bunch of FL politicians to get ahead. Karma's a bitch and Trump's an ass
709893563631407105 2016-03-15 00:06:29 UTC <Bearnmind> Goody - all 3 Trump channels, @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews, will now air 2 mins of Kaisch and Clinton and the entirety of Trump gloating.

709888430604468225 2016-03-15 23:46:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @MSNBC Reporting election results in FL w/polls still open tells remaining voters their votes don't count. Just for ratings

709887396863721472 2016-03-15 23:41:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC continuing their practice of a couple of minutes of inane commentary and election coverage sandwiched between commercials
709884634134388737 2016-03-15 23:31:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN calls it Trump's coalition. Is it truly a coalition if it's just angry white voters? Call it like it is. - Trump's white voters
709883883219771392 2016-03-15 23:28:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @DoktorZoom He thinks the number of flags correlate to his "size". The number keeps growing and growing. But given that he lies, um...
709883351902130177 2016-03-15 23:25:54 UTC <Bearnmind> C'mon @CNN - key race alert?  Seriously just call it election results. You guys are hysterical and forever calling any news breaking news

709722962421800961 2016-03-15 12:48:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @ezraklein excellent point - @realDonaldTrump despite his braggadocio has exceptionally bad judgment & looks like an idiot on Twitter
709721698313117696 2016-03-15 12:43:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump So Pete Rose said he didn't endorse you or send you that signed baseball. Why are you lying about that?

709431394842370048 2016-03-14 17:29:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @samsteinhp @CitizenCohn @realDonaldTrump When your supporters finally see you for the demagogue and liar you are....
709430288447885313 2016-03-14 17:25:36 UTC <Bearnmind> I can see how @realDonaldTrump could overestimate his wealth. He does it with crowd numbers too. Clearly he can't count
709429915846840320 2016-03-14 17:24:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood Does he understand what POTUS actually can and can't do?  It's like he's running to be an elexted dictator or King.
709429511180439552 2016-03-14 17:22:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @ChrisChristie - I get why your own state dislikes you. Publicity > funeral of a fallen hero. Career crashinghttps://twitter.com/buzzfeedandrew/status/709413338091020288
709427523000647681 2016-03-14 17:14:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood and yet hasn't HRC received more votes than Trump? I guess only his votes count
709427163406200832 2016-03-14 17:13:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @tchop__StL Maybe Trump has gone too far even by @CNN low standards. One can only hope
709426769665859584 2016-03-14 17:11:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller No doubt @realDonaldTrump will send them a cease & desist letter.
709426004515758080 2016-03-14 17:08:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum is there no depth of humiliation @ChrisChristie won't sink to to kiss Trump's ass &stay relevant?  How far Christie has fallen.
709425299067375616 2016-03-14 17:05:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @CNNReliable why that would there even be a question. You call him out. If he lies and media ignores it they're complicit
709424825475993600 2016-03-14 17:03:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @RyanLizza Wow
709362768059756544 2016-03-14 12:57:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @IAmCait @eonline Seriously, pull the plug on this show. I barely made it thru last season, after this premiere I'm not even going to try
709362080126730242 2016-03-14 12:54:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @IAmCait your views are the opposite of the LBGT community. Wish you would disavow media attempts to  paint you as face of LBGT issues
709360947035566081 2016-03-14 12:50:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @Caitlyn_Jenner no disrespect intended, the media made you the de facto face of LBGT issues, but given how divisive you are, not a good fit
709336953116876800 2016-03-14 11:14:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @2muchjoy That the example he used
709325930188169217 2016-03-14 10:30:55 UTC <Bearnmind> Trumps Week of Errors, Exaggerations and Flat-out Falsehoods http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/trump-fact-check-errors-exaggerations-falsehoods-213730
709227100574720000 2016-03-13 03:58:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @2muchjoy ask his campaign and see what answer you get. Not many in his campaign know how Tricare works for active/retired military
709226835259858945 2016-03-13 03:57:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @2muchjoy the difference between the tax and what you save by not paying health care deductibles. Tricare doesn't pay those. So tax increase
709226519843971072 2016-03-13 03:55:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @2muchjoy I've seen that. His health care plan imposes 2.2% tax increase for incomes under $200k. The savings is supposed to be (1 of 2)
709210079812296704 2016-03-13 02:50:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @Reince a lot easier for Reince to criticize rather than look in the mirror. The @GOP is being destroyed under his leadership
709209624487051264 2016-03-13 02:48:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @Reince From the head of the party who is trying to elect a demagogue, inciting violence & tearing apart the country.
709208711504515073 2016-03-13 02:45:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP clean up the epic failure of your party before you start pointing fingers. Trump is destroying your party. Reap what you sow
709207969624416257 2016-03-13 02:42:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @2muchjoy the tax increase he says he'll impose to pay for single payer system is about $5000 more for a family.
709180974983200768 2016-03-13 00:54:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @2muchjoy @SenSanders I have and I've contacted his campaign. They didn't have an answer. His plan hurts military families #DemTownHall
709180683827154944 2016-03-13 00:53:45 UTC <Bearnmind> IMO if @SenSanders truly believed his political revolution, he would have run as an Independent since he's not a democrat. #DemTownHall
709180026118340608 2016-03-13 00:51:08 UTC <Bearnmind> #DemTownHall @SenSanders Where are the savings for Tricare recipients? Military families get the tax increase but not the savings.
709179789077250048 2016-03-13 00:50:12 UTC <Bearnmind> #DemTownHall what frustrates me about @SenSanders is that he doesn't ever say how he's going to get his ideas done.
709178724667805700 2016-03-13 00:45:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @wadewire out of curiosity, what support do you have for HRC starting the birther issue. Can you point me to it. I'd like to read it

708997565543522304 2016-03-13 12:46:06 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey @realDonaldTrump - the First Amendment protects the right to free speech; it does not protect you from protest and criticism.

705478470973972480 2016-03-03 19:42:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Will you agree to resign if you're elected and Mexico won't pay for your $40 billion wall?
705478220800499712 2016-03-03 19:41:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @dcbigjohn I have serious concerns about the intelligence and mental stability of his supporters
705478075933401089 2016-03-03 19:40:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger The Great Trump Wall of America. We should be so proud.
705477452345315328 2016-03-03 19:38:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes If Romney doesn't have what it takes, why did @realDonaldTrump endorse him? Doesn't say much about his "great" judgment
705477089865154564 2016-03-03 19:37:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @dcbigjohn hypocrisy of @realDonaldTrump calling anyone else a terrible person is astounding. But clearly Trump U and taxes getting to him
705476849384734721 2016-03-03 19:36:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump - recheck your reading abilityhttps://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/705476121014505473
705476623701811200 2016-03-03 19:35:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @CNN @msnbc There is no point to airing this any more. Are you going to give the others equal time?
705475609472978944 2016-03-03 19:31:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump If Trump Univ wasn't a scam why do you keep trying to rationalize the lawsuit?
705475417550004224 2016-03-03 19:30:21 UTC <Bearnmind> And again nothing of substance, just egotistical musings to his lemmings and the media (same thing?)
705475110271127557 2016-03-03 19:29:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger Security forces? Even subconsciously everyone knows Trump thinks he's running for Dictator in Chief
705474414960369665 2016-03-03 19:26:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix Soooo presidential
705474212337754117 2016-03-03 19:25:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller This man's ego
705473915175436288 2016-03-03 19:24:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN Really? More egotistical obnoxious ramblings from Trump being given free airtime.
705473701031104512 2016-03-03 19:23:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger what an ass Trump is. I can't believe anyone thinks he's presidential or would do anything but embarrass this country
705473429923864576 2016-03-03 19:22:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @samknight1 And Trump just made Romney's point. 3rd grade insults and the media laps it up. There is no value to this
705472222136246273 2016-03-03 19:17:39 UTC <Bearnmind> So @realDonaldTrump what are you doing with the millions in donations you've rec'd for your campaign? Donating it to vets?
705455364163162114 2016-03-03 18:10:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @nate_mcdermott @Nate_McDermott @BuzzFeedAndrew They should be paying him. Funny how just facts about Trump are actually oppo material. He's that bad
705454855553470465 2016-03-03 18:08:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @GovChristie @ZekeJMiller @Livestream Does Christie only get 1 flag because he's a lackey?
705454472043094016 2016-03-03 18:07:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @greenfield64 Given that Trump never makes mistakes and has the best judgment ever, what does it say about him he endorsed a "loser"?
705421321623179264 2016-03-03 15:55:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @Slate How three fierce female justices took control of the Supreme Court: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/supreme_court_dispatches/2016/03/in_oral_arguments_for_the_texas_abortion_case_the_three_female_justices.html?wpsrc=sh_all_tab_tw_top via @slate
705392706391023616 2016-03-03 14:01:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Without doubt, viewer opinion of you @morningmika and Morning Joe will never be the same. I know mine is now very unfavorable
705391819903930368 2016-03-03 13:58:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC hey @morningmika Your righteous indignation of criticism you receive for being in the tank for Trumps rings hollow. A hit dog barks
705391309478109184 2016-03-03 13:56:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire a great scam artist can convince a lot of people that he cares about them.  @realDonaldTrump is a great scam artist
705390798133731329 2016-03-03 13:54:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @megynkelly will eviscerate @realDonaldTrump just by asking tough questions & following up when he doesn't answer
705389971495100417 2016-03-03 13:50:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @larry_kudlow @JohnJHarwood or the Dems know Clinton is going to be the nominee. Trump ell energize the Dems to vote in the general
705389611833548800 2016-03-03 13:49:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter That isn't journalism. That just click bait and illustrates why the public believes media is biased towards Trump
705389008344489984 2016-03-03 13:46:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedBen @ksheekey why not? Coalesce around a 3rd party and take that threat away from Trump. Lots of media attention if they do
705388121148559360 2016-03-03 13:43:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Morning Joe's indignation at Romney's speech stands in stark contrast to their Trump ass-kissing interview.
705387587968565248 2016-03-03 13:41:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @CNN @voxdotcom @ezraklein @cnn @msnbc So the media is forsaking fair/unbiased reporting, public credibility and trust for clicks/ad revenue
705387003588845568 2016-03-03 13:39:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP @Gawker @politicalwire The @gop has hit new lows. @Reince is doing a great job destroying the party
705386759245406209 2016-03-03 13:38:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops Ladies and Gentlemen - the @GOP. @Senate_GOPs @HouseGOP w/their racist hatred created Trump & idiots like thishttps://twitter.com/gawker/status/705384352704831488
705386171183063040 2016-03-03 13:35:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @morningmika You just let Trump lie unchallenged again. It's just embarrassing to watch you
705385558428815360 2016-03-03 13:33:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @morningmika and Joe "Trump Light" Scarborough still not asking tough questions ofTrump. Why not just make kissy noises and get it over?
705369596140908544 2016-03-03 12:29:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @maggieNYT @mmurraypolitics @realDonaldTrump What does it say about your "great" judgment that you endorsed him?
705369107189927936 2016-03-03 12:27:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Where the rest? For someone who professes to love vets, you don't seem to care about getting them their money? Scam?
705239643256705024 2016-03-02 03:53:28 UTC <Bearnmind> Wow. LOL It's like they read my mind. Looks like @realDonaldTrump is going to be extra busy on Twitter tonight.https://twitter.com/elilake/status/705234561756696576
705237378231902209 2016-03-02 03:44:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @bpolitics He disavows it but the interview will air. Damage already done
705234707982712832 2016-03-02 03:33:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @JohnJHarwood I'm not a fan of @HouseGOP or @Senate_GOPs but I respect the ones standing on their principles and refusing to back Trump
705234257501929472 2016-03-02 03:32:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix @WillieGeist @PageSixEmily The optics are bad for @nbc @MSNBC Get rid of minority hosts but give Geist one. Diversity in reverse
705228646617890817 2016-03-02 03:09:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @ReutersBiz Or cowardice
705193078659915776 2016-03-02 00:48:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump is willing to destroy this country in order to be King.
705192770026278914 2016-03-02 00:47:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @BuzzFeedAndrew He has been impressive. I wonder if he realizes how important what he's doing actually is. I think he does
705192562039132160 2016-03-02 00:46:23 UTC <Bearnmind> I feel for the Trumpeteers. They desperately believe @realDonaldTrump. The damage to the country & their lives will be on their heads
705191618954059776 2016-03-02 00:42:38 UTC <Bearnmind> Sounds a lot like @realDonaldTrump. Hitler's followers thought he was great too. This is how it startshttps://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/705176305877311489
705191253990838272 2016-03-02 00:41:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump - your supporters are in for a shock when you show your true self.https://twitter.com/joshgreenman/status/705173594196856833
705190735159631872 2016-03-02 00:39:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Your supporters who know you lie but think it's only to others should look hard at Trump Univ. Those guys believed you too
705189665280757761 2016-03-02 00:34:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeed @realDonaldTrump is our version of Canada's Rob Ford.
705138916530253824 2016-03-02 21:13:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @JakeSherman @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Wonder what Ryan thought of the very public threat
705034367639363584 2016-03-02 14:17:46 UTC <Bearnmind> Where are the calls for @Reince to resign given that under his watch the @GOP is being torn apart?
705000219646234625 2016-03-02 12:02:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @nbc @MSNBC Get rid of minority hosts, white man gets his own show. NBC - diversity as long as it doesn't involve minorities
704999641746636800 2016-03-02 11:59:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd Excellent point - if only every other pundit hadn't already pointed this out repeatedly
704998431874523136 2016-03-02 11:54:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR 2008 = 1st serious female and 1st black candidate. It was historic. Doesn't seem accurate to compare. Why not use 2012?
704997783120564224 2016-03-02 11:52:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc Ever notice Joe cant let a perceived criticism of himself go unchallenged on @Morning_Joe? Remind you of anyone? Joe = Trump light
704992745480441856 2016-03-02 11:32:23 UTC <Bearnmind> Goody @JoeNBC & the @Morning_Joe crew is patting their collective backs over their foresight. Yet again Scarborough's ego = Trumps.
704881345311416320 2016-03-01 04:09:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @mateagold @JohnJHarwood @jdelreal Trump has tapped into white Americans who fear becoming a minority but want to call it something else
704878871838134272 2016-03-01 03:59:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes Trump's success is proof that white privilege isn't going to die easily
704878452143493121 2016-03-01 03:58:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @MSNBC I'm starting to believe the comparisons of Trump/Hitler aren't as outrageous as I thought
704877878203322368 2016-03-01 03:55:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @AC360 @andersoncooper I have to say that Jeffrey Lord is offensive
704876151295057920 2016-03-01 03:49:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC - can you just remind people of the percentage of eligible voters who actually vote in primaries?
704875908512006144 2016-03-01 03:48:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller I'm sure if he wins it will be the most important win ever
704872093285019648 2016-03-01 03:32:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @Reince Under your watch the Republican Party has spectacularly imploded and the country will suffer for it. Bang up job you've done
704869361031450624 2016-03-01 03:22:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattkatz00 @RyanLizza Trump's ego won't stand for that. Twitter storm coming later
704869082923974656 2016-03-01 03:20:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @mtaibbi Trump hasn't really faced a tough challenge. He will with HRC. The criticism alone will make him drive him crazy.
704868601380139009 2016-03-01 03:19:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel Cruz putting the very public pressure on @marcorubio
704868389920055296 2016-03-01 03:18:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @HankEpton @politicalwire The damage he would do would be catastrophic
704868143060140032 2016-03-01 03:17:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire serious question - can Rubio carry FL with the lead the polls show for Trump?
704867028990033921 2016-03-01 03:12:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @ddiamond @BuzzFeedAndrew Still more voting against him than for him
704866582154121216 2016-03-01 03:11:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller They're trying, against him
704866464604545024 2016-03-01 03:10:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter He has millions of people? Does he think anyone who supports him belongs to him? Wait, it looks like he owns @ChrisChristie
704865102739148801 2016-03-01 03:05:10 UTC <Bearnmind> I can unequivocally state that I would never be proud to have @realDonaldTrump as POTUS
704864635837669377 2016-03-01 03:03:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller So @marcorubio really got under @realDonaldTrump skin
704864474860224513 2016-03-01 03:02:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @MSNBC I would love to see @realDonaldTrump try and make Apple do anything. He seriously thinks he's going to be a king
704863418575093760 2016-03-01 02:58:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @SusanPage @politicalwire until he opened his mouth.
704863095794094080 2016-03-01 02:57:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR I guess Texas isn't an amazing state since they didn't vote for him
704862809205698560 2016-03-01 02:56:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @dpletka @JohnJHarwood To humiliate him. First you have to break them down, then you can start the reprogramming
704862550928785408 2016-03-01 02:55:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller Well we only have one.
704862263837065216 2016-03-01 02:53:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire hardly presidential. Trump must be the most insecure man in the world. @marcorubio must be right about the small hands
704861846629650432 2016-03-01 02:52:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel where is the news part of this? This is just another Trump ego stroke. He's like an ego masturbator.
704861584347242496 2016-03-01 02:51:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix Wait, I can't catch my breath from ROFL, a uniter
704861229022625792 2016-03-01 02:49:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes Trump really can't help being a dick.
704860822317735937 2016-03-01 02:48:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @anamariecox @DoktorZoom Christie looks like a hostage being forced to read a statement
704860036628156416 2016-03-01 02:45:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @greenfield64 maybe Trump's going to announce Christie as his VP
704859640828436480 2016-03-01 02:43:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @CNN Quick, someone get @realDonaldTrump more flags. He's has to overcompensate for stubby fingers and small hands
704858923325628416 2016-03-01 02:40:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix Doesn't the Cruz wins mean that @realDonaldTrump failed to meet expectations? He said he would win them all.
704858618135453697 2016-03-01 02:39:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Don't let Brian Williams ever utter the phrase "help a brother out again".
704852109183815681 2016-03-01 02:13:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix if @marcorubio thought there was a chance he would win any state, he would have waited until later to speak
704851867990368256 2016-03-01 02:12:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire this is a bad night for Rubio.
704851521792548864 2016-03-01 02:11:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @KilloughCNN It's having an impact - Cruz is winning. @marcorubio trying to justify him staying in is just sad.
704851254783172609 2016-03-01 02:10:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins Nor will it be held by @marcorubio
704851119198052352 2016-03-01 02:09:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire @marcorubio speech - I haven't won yet but I almost came close. This is pathetic.
704850882748350464 2016-03-01 02:08:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @KimberlyEAtkins @brianstelter @HillaryClinton For the 1st time she was inspiring. I like this Hillary
704847390407335936 2016-03-01 01:54:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @samsteinhp @cnnbrk And @marcorubio is staying in the race with a 0-15 record why?  If he was viable he'd have won at least a state
704846327771996160 2016-03-01 01:50:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire What's gets lost is that only a small percentage of eligible voters are determining the fate of the @GOP & possibly the US
704845488311377921 2016-03-01 01:47:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @smerconish Can we all agree it's time to put Carson's campaign out of its misery? It would be a mercy killing
704843268635435008 2016-03-01 01:38:25 UTC <Bearnmind> Instead of businessman under his name in @MSNBC, can you just call him what he is - demagogue, liar, xenophobe, misogynist. Any of them work
704842270957314048 2016-03-01 01:34:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias why would he get out? His strategy of winning by losing all the way to the convention. It's working beautifully.
704841336722223104 2016-03-01 01:30:44 UTC <Bearnmind> I just figured it out. @realDonaldTrump is the pandemic disease the gov't has been warning about
704840055244898304 2016-03-01 01:25:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc Time to watch @CNN. That wasn't even 1 min between commercials. Way to keep viewers
704839215205490689 2016-03-01 01:22:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeed A face only Putin and Assad can love
704839046414143489 2016-03-01 01:21:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeed So what news is he going to make at his presser? Endorsement? Or he needs to recharge his lungs with free air time.
704838790192439296 2016-03-01 01:20:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix because it's too horrible to contemplate to the 70% of voters who don't vote in the primaries.
704838543332548608 2016-03-01 01:19:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc 3 minutes election coverage/3 mins ads. At least you're being fair and unbiased in that respect.
704838046248738817 2016-03-01 01:17:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @teddyschleifer Have to divert attention from @marcorubio strategy of winning by losing every state.
704837465861967872 2016-03-01 01:15:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @TVietor08 @politicalwire @Reince i second that. Your party has to publicly announce its not overtly racist or bigoted. Great optics.
704836915376295938 2016-03-01 01:13:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc election coverage consists of commercials with occasional primary result breaks.
704828779127037952 2016-03-01 00:40:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @JillDLawrence @ZekeJMiller @USATODAY @ChrisChristie Are you seriously using NJ taxpayer money to fund your ass-kissing for a VP or AG slot?

704826892910780416 2016-03-01 00:33:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @ZekeJMiller I get that. Trump's honest about his bigotry, the @Senate_GOPs like to keep theirs just below the surface.

702698360663359491 2016-02-24 03:35:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN Listening to "Heidi" explain why the Trump family has sacrificed more than the others for campaign. Delusional.
702690401988304896 2016-02-24 03:03:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump is refusing to release his taxes until after he secures the nom. It must be bad if he thinks it will impact his support
702676513695596545 2016-02-24 02:08:30 UTC <Bearnmind> Read the article. @realDonaldTrump has a habit of threatening/intimidating womenhttps://twitter.com/slate/status/702614366743560192
702659418492674048 2016-02-24 01:00:34 UTC <Bearnmind> Read an article the other day saying @BuzzFeed was lightweight. Seems to me they're the only ones with the balls to expose Trump's views
702658923061501952 2016-02-24 00:58:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @RyanLizza doesn't that just make you warm and fuzzy for a Trump monarchy?  Maybe @marcorubio or @tedcruz will grow a pair & take him on.

701247772566142977 2016-02-20 03:31:12 UTC <Bearnmind> If @GOP cared about this country, they would look past 2016 to 2020 when they could nom someone who wouldn't destroy the party & the country
701246312545705985 2016-02-20 03:25:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel I just realized what's different. In 2008 I was filled with hope; in 2016 I'm filled with dread
701244830064709632 2016-02-20 03:19:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @costareports For all their lionizations of Reagan, none of the @GOP candidates have any if the qualities that made him special.
701243896815288320 2016-02-20 03:15:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller What a hypocrite @marcorubio is.
701243640463671296 2016-02-20 03:14:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins Honestly @marcorubio has no shame. I think he's in it for the money not ideology. He's too desperate to be POTUS.
701226848395599872 2016-02-20 02:08:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @dpletka @BuzzFeedBen The scary thing is that his supporters seem to think that's exactly what it is.
701226712089104384 2016-02-20 02:07:30 UTC <Bearnmind> Anyone want to bet on the likelihood that Jeb doesn't endorse Trump?
701226590030667779 2016-02-20 02:07:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias as importantly, Rubio should be very afraid. Trump needs a new target now that Jeb is gone.
701225989435686912 2016-02-20 02:04:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @georgepbush @ZekeJMiller Jeb is a kind, moral and decent man. Those traits sadly have no place in today's @GOP.
701225569560764416 2016-02-20 02:02:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias excellent point. Is there any data that shows Rubio picks up majority of Jeb voters?

701206034405318658 2016-02-20 00:45:21 UTC <Bearnmind> Why @MSNBC's why? More Trump shilling from @JoeNBC thinly disguised as punditry. Your integrity/credibility is in shreds already.

700171519733923841 2016-02-17 04:14:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc @JoeNBC must be gluttons for humiliation given how many times they showing the Trump ad disguised as a "town hall". Joe, need TP?
700155392790302721 2016-02-17 03:10:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @SopanDeb @BuzzFeedAndrew There are no depths too low for Trump. Gives me nightmares to think he could represent the Us internationally
700155020336066560 2016-02-17 03:08:59 UTC <Bearnmind> Good thing he wouldn't be under pressure as POTUS.  He crumbles when stressed #notqualified #anxietyproblems https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/700141484604002305
700154739326062593 2016-02-17 03:07:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @Steven_Strauss @mckaycoppins @politicoroger The only person who thinks @marcorubio is a foreign policy expert is Marco Rubio.
700154378779549696 2016-02-17 03:06:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller And I'm still not seeing it. I'd rather watch reality TV than listen to @marcorubio. Reality TV is more honest than Marco-bot
700153903065784321 2016-02-17 03:04:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @morningmoneyben @chrislhayes so does this statement mean @marcorubio will return the salary he gets for not doing his job?
700153541273526273 2016-02-17 03:03:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @tackettdc @JohnJHarwood @maggieNYT His ego will be his undoing. Despite threats, @realDonaldTrump doesn't have the guts to run as an IND
700152791956856832 2016-02-17 03:00:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @jmartNYT @JohnJHarwood  I absolutely believe the @Senate_GOPs @HouseGOP have treated Obama so disrespectfully because he's black.
700140556299735042 2016-02-17 02:11:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller it's not @marcorubio fault, it's his programmer's.
700140277361676290 2016-02-17 02:10:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @carogonza @morningmika @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe Explains why no one other than DC insiders watch the show. No depths @MSNBC won't sink to
700139122825043968 2016-02-17 02:05:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger Someone needs to refresh Carson in basic math. 1% < 45%. Do you think his staff is keeping his poll numbers from him?
700137730567757824 2016-02-17 02:00:17 UTC <Bearnmind> I need to watch some trash TV on @bravo. Anything would be better than watching Joe/Mika kiss Trump's ass on @MSNBC #TrumpSCTownHall
700136790972362752 2016-02-17 01:56:33 UTC <Bearnmind> Not sure who comes off worse with this #trumptownhall in @MSNBC, the network or @JoeMSNBC. Undercuts their stmt last week defending ole Joe
700135619188690945 2016-02-17 01:51:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC informed perspective for your network means @JoeMSNBC can inform you of the state of Trump's colon #trumptownhall #msnbcTrump
700135029901549568 2016-02-17 01:49:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @JoeNBC it's a relief to know you're not a serious journalist. So far up Trump's ass I'm embarrassed for you and @msnbc #trumptownhall
700134350424301568 2016-02-17 01:46:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC The "studio audience" at the Trump commercial on @msnbc reflects a lacking diversity. I completely understand why MSNBC's ratings are so low
700133354293825536 2016-02-17 01:42:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC just giving up all pretense of credibility with this Townhall. Ass kissing hosts, "studio audience" (joe's words) instead of voters
700131332798558208 2016-02-17 01:34:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @JoeMSNBC Your network motto should be changed to "Indepth analysis of Trump's ass from  an insider's view" #msnbcTrump
700130360324157440 2016-02-17 01:31:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger Yeah but I doubt they are the same types of 3am calls POTUS gets.
700130155151388672 2016-02-17 01:30:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc This townhall is ridiculous. Joe/Mika asking softball questions that he never answers. So far up Trump's ass it's embarrassing
700129442312646656 2016-02-17 01:27:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix seriously is this the most important issue you have to tweet about. Trying to make an issue where there is none
700114233816702976 2016-02-17 00:26:55 UTC <Bearnmind> A politician's decision to be pro-life should not override a woman's right to be pro-choice
700112990998294528 2016-02-17 00:21:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @hardball_chris It's a false narrative that Obama caused polarization. The reaction of GOP to the election of the 1st black POTUS caused it
700102696183951361 2016-02-17 23:41:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller she's just blatantly lying. Definitely belongs with @marcorubio. They have so many traits in common
700076634716639233 2016-02-17 21:57:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @RosieGray @BuzzFeedBen the fact that Issa supports @marcorubio bot is enough for me to not vote for him. I guess endorsements do matter
700075962151608321 2016-02-17 21:54:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @RosieGray @BuzzFeedBen unbelievable how weak @realDonaldTrump is as a man. He attacks/lies constantly but cries if he's attacked #fragile
700075485796167681 2016-02-17 21:52:57 UTC <Bearnmind> When did political reporters become snarky political pundits instead of journalists?
700071875142098944 2016-02-17 21:38:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @stephenfhayes @ZekeJMiller Does @realDonaldTrump really not understand how SCOTUS judges are appointed? What he doesn't know is yuuge
700070943021015040 2016-02-17 21:34:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @marcorubio you already did, so add to the list unless I'm required to think on my own or go off script I won't embarrass you
700070162469359617 2016-02-17 21:31:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @WaPoSean @marcorubio is incapable of independent thought and rapid response. He's a memorized script robot
700069275931906048 2016-02-17 21:28:16 UTC <Bearnmind> Which shows exactly how little he knows and how bad Trump he is on foreign policyhttps://twitter.com/buzzfeedandrew/status/700050701964177409
700069100844875776 2016-02-17 21:27:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes honestly not seeing what the issue is. Usually POTUS or VP attends, the VP is attending. Bush did the same
700067716313522177 2016-02-17 21:22:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @NBCNews @TheFix POTUS doesn't always attend SCOTUS funerals so this is a non-issue. The VP is attending and POTUS will pay his respects
700066211820916736 2016-02-17 21:16:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @SteveRattner @politicalwire Scalia wasn't a national hero. He was an appointed judge. The VP is attending which seems appropriate
700039745095778305 2016-02-17 19:30:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum the media and pundits have been so accurate so far. Endorsements no longer matter
700033775200309250 2016-02-17 19:07:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @BuzzFeedAndrew seriously Trump and his petty childish insults are lowering the intelligence of the entire country
700033534778589184 2016-02-17 19:06:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @kristymcampbell @JohnJHarwood @ZekeJMiller that would require no script & independent thought which @marcorubio is clearly incapable of
700033268704530432 2016-02-17 19:05:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller Rubio & Trump = pot calling kettle black when it comes to Cruz and lying. They're all liars

699919509910654976 2016-02-17 11:33:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc ad on @Morning_Joe this am for  their Trump love fest town hall "Trump will answer the tough questions from Joe and Mika..." Hahahaha
699916820724240385 2016-02-17 11:22:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @morningjoemsnbc Joe Scarborough bemoaning lack of media vetting of candidates is laughable given his blatant bias & "support" of Trump.
699756781267001344 2016-02-16 00:46:32 UTC <Bearnmind> My opinion - Trump is appealing to voters whose biggest fear is becoming a minority. Which could show how they have treated minorities

699750571339857922 2016-02-16 00:21:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc Joe Scarborough blatantly in the tank for Trump with this Townhall. What little credibility @Morning_Joe had is gone.
699749813731065856 2016-02-16 00:18:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @CNN @msnbc @washingtonpost @nytpolitics The MSM is unduly influencing this election just by the amount of free press Trump gets.
699748848923713537 2016-02-16 00:15:00 UTC <Bearnmind> IMHO, looking back on how viciously & personally Obama has been attacked speaks volumes about the character of GOP & many in this country
699738360450043904 2016-02-16 23:33:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN Seriously it would be impossible for your network to be any further up Trump's ass. I'm embarrassed for you.

699717955400159232 2016-02-16 22:12:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @Senate_GOPs should act like grown-ups & do the job they were elected to do & get paid for.  Just a drop but if they don't, I'm voting Dem.

699427570828382209 2016-02-15 02:58:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea the cast of Vanderpump Rules are the least self-aware people I've seen in a long time.
699424511553306625 2016-02-15 02:46:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @jonward11 @JohnJHarwood @jpaceDC and yet when Trump does it, the press complies with nothing more than a whimper.
699424071868686336 2016-02-15 02:44:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix and how are you going to cover it? Constitutional crisis or interesting side note?

699407307227136000 2016-02-15 01:37:51 UTC <Bearnmind> Trump is right about 1 thing - @tedcruz lies about the history of last year SCOTUS confirmations. Kennedy confirmed in '88 Reagan's last yr
699355880991674369 2016-02-15 22:13:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @elliosch @ZekeJMiller @marcorubio can't tell America from Canada maybe he meant to run for  PM instead of POTUS. Not qualified for either

699340294207250432 2016-02-15 21:11:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger But you gotta hand it to Trump. He plays CNN like a fiddle. @tedcruz won't get nat'l airtime from CNN to rebut.
699340097943109633 2016-02-15 21:10:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger Trump doesn't believe a word of what he says. He wants free nat'l air time and @CNN salivates to give it to him.
699339611441668097 2016-02-15 21:08:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood I'm am by no means a @tedcruz fan. Can't stand him actually, but I would call bullshit on that statement.
699339269882716161 2016-02-15 21:07:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger the really good liars are in Congress
699339097572298752 2016-02-15 21:06:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller huh?
699339020476747776 2016-02-15 21:06:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger and Donald Trump is a well-known civil rights icon who cared about African-American issues long before he needed their votes
699338508012560386 2016-02-15 21:04:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger Except his lies. We should believe his lies because they're great lies, they're yuuge lies, enough lies to build a wall with
699337898433384448 2016-02-15 21:02:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger it's almost like a cult. All the evidence is there to see what he is and people are willfully blind. See what they want to
699337607260590082 2016-02-15 21:00:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum translated to Teddy is being mean to me and if you don't make him stop in going to take my ball and go home.
699337348740444160 2016-02-15 20:59:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger amazing the his supporters see this stuff and think @realDonaldTrump is tough. I can't wait to see how they rationalize this
699337136483516416 2016-02-15 20:59:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger if Trump can't handle what @tedcruz says, imagine how badly he'd handle the constant criticism of being POTUS
699336823651303428 2016-02-15 20:57:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix Wow, just wow. @tedcruz has gotten so far under the Donald's skin, he's become unhinged. Trump seriously cannot take criticism
699336170753363970 2016-02-15 20:55:10 UTC <Bearnmind> If @Reince was smart, he'd let Trump go. Trump can't win an independent run. Focus on 2020 race and fix the GOPhttps://twitter.com/emorwee/status/699328902645166081
699335501178892288 2016-02-15 20:52:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @emorwee @JuddLegum Trump's ego is fragile. But I'm sure @Reince will cave, he's terrified of Trump & an independent run. Tail wags the dog
699335214477287428 2016-02-15 20:51:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @emorwee @JuddLegum so Trump can attack however and whoever he wants but if he gets attacked he gets his feelings hurt?
699334951146274816 2016-02-15 20:50:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood if @tedcruz wins, we are one step away from going back to the 1800s. That man should be allowed nowhere near the Oval Office

699300810614816769 2016-02-15 18:34:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood and his supporters really believe he only lies to everyone else, not them. Trump's ego will be his downfall- hopefully soon
699300517227302912 2016-02-15 18:33:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew goes to show how much of a liar @marcorubio is. Desperation isn't a good look on him. Btw, what has he accomplished again?

698952783844798464 2016-02-14 19:31:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @Senate_GOPs - American people need to have a say in SCOTUS nom. People had a say in 2008 & 2012 but the @GOP wants to nullify the 2012 vote

698738130262818820 2016-02-13 05:18:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @MSNBC debate showed  how Trump reacts when faced with criticism. So anyone really think he would "win" dealing w/heads of state?

698693252887769088 2016-02-13 02:20:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops Unbelievable that the candidates are urging @Senate_GOPs to do nothing. It's impossible for them to do less than they already do #GOPDebate
698692907222573056 2016-02-13 02:19:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @tedcruz lying about the 80 years of history re Supreme Court justices. But I'd be more surprised if he told the truth  #GOPDebate

698691351081316352 2016-02-13 02:12:53 UTC <Bearnmind> Such bullshit. If it was a sitting GOP candidate, they'd be screaming if the Dems said he shouldn't submit a nomination #GOPDebate

698690962885836800 2016-02-13 02:11:21 UTC <Bearnmind> Good to know that these candidates don't think much of the Constitution. At least they aren't pretending anymore  #GOPDebate
698690795658985473 2016-02-13 02:10:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops I hope our @Senate_GOPs doesn't do their job. Not to worry Trump, they haven't done their job in years.  #GOPDebate
698690487591575552 2016-02-13 02:09:27 UTC <Bearnmind> If you're attached by another candidate.  #GOPDebate
698690135089639424 2016-02-13 02:08:03 UTC <Bearnmind> Already there's something odd about this debate. That intro was awkward #GOPDebate
698674486653091840 2016-02-13 01:05:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger You mean the same people who elected Obama in 2012? Why doesn't that will of the people count?

698659180798939136 2016-02-13 00:05:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro @BuzzFeedAndrew those were 2 unrelated thoughts btw. But letting the @GOP in its current state have 2 branches of gov't =catastrophe
698658505817989121 2016-02-13 00:02:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro @BuzzFeedAndrew this demonstrates clearly why the constitution has checks/balances. A GOP POTUS w/current Congress would run amok
698657874608812032 2016-02-13 23:59:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @CNN @marcorubio @tedcruz @cnn So you are advocating publicly that the @Senate_GOPs ignore their constitutional duty for political gain
698657560308617217 2016-02-13 23:58:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @jbarro @BuzzFeedAndrew Obama should continually send up nominees. Force the @Senate_GOPs to do their dirty work publicly.
698654940810575872 2016-02-13 23:48:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @CNN @cnn @MSNBC When did the political desire of the @Senate_GOPs trump (no pun intended) the will of the people?
698653717386674176 2016-02-13 23:43:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @JuddLegum Again, the @Senate_GOPs have no right to put their politics ahead of their duty and the majority of the people's vote in 2012.
698653367933992962 2016-02-13 23:41:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @dcbigjohn so the @Senate_GOPs are subverting democracy. Isn't our democracy what makes us great?
698652891423379456 2016-02-13 23:40:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @JohnAvlon The @Senate_GOPs are imposing their will/circumventing the majority of the country's vote in 2012. That's not democracy
698652013614252032 2016-02-13 23:36:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @dcbigjohn Why not? Because the @Senate_GOPs will be subverting the people's vote by not confirming a nomination by our duly elected POTUS
698651327094718464 2016-02-13 23:33:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @samsteinhp why are we allowing the @Senate_GOPs to not do their constitutional duty because they don't like the result of the 2012 election
698650910638080000 2016-02-13 23:32:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @JakeSherman The people had a say when they elected Obama.
698650673907417088 2016-02-13 23:31:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @BuzzFeedNews @BuzzFeed and the American people should not allow @Senate_GOPs to filibuster.
698650502263939073 2016-02-13 23:30:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @RyanLizza @GlennThrush @Senate_GOPs - the American people did get a say - they elected Obama. Do your damn job for once
698649853455437824 2016-02-13 23:28:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @dcbigjohn @iantDC It's sad that everyone already knows that the @Senate_GOPs won't do their job. Remind me again, why we pay them?
698648513991802882 2016-02-13 23:22:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR Refresh my memory. Was there a year long waiting period to fill Day-O'Connor's seat out of respect for her when she retired?
698645126202130432 2016-02-13 23:09:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @dave911rsr @mckaycoppins @marcorubio Too funny
698645021319434241 2016-02-13 23:08:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrisgeidner @dcbigjohn I wish I had hope this could make @Scotus apolitical again. But it's going to illustrate how broken Congress is
698644029727182848 2016-02-13 23:04:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins Of course, we shouldn't worry what @marcorubio says. The Marco-bot isn't programmed to actually show up at work.
698643808590950400 2016-02-13 23:03:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins Translated - Here's our opportunity to officially make the Supreme Court an arm of the Republican Party
698640096539627520 2016-02-13 22:49:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins @tedcruz I missed the part in the constitution that says in an election year no Supreme Court justice slots can be filled
698639307163222022 2016-02-13 22:46:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix @realDonaldTrump The court is supposed to be non-political. But your tweet reveals exactly how the @GOP views the court.
698638217315225604 2016-02-13 22:41:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire That assumes @tedcruz cares about the constitution when it's not politically convenient for him.
698637848589811712 2016-02-13 22:40:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN now all the GOP candidates will want to ignore the constitution & not fill slot. They want to make the court even more political.
698636930666340352 2016-02-13 22:36:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @tedcruz You owe it to the country to appoint a qualified Justice. Not to wait for political reasons. But you put power/party over country
698636595071729664 2016-02-13 22:35:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @tedcruz BS. If there was a sitting GOP POTUS, Ted would be saying we owe it to the country to fill immediately. Hypocrite
698636076676681728 2016-02-13 22:33:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @greenfield64 So for 9 months the @Senate_GOPs will delay doing their job to confirm a Justice. Business as usual. Get paid to do nothingn
698635520109367298 2016-02-13 22:31:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @LukeRussert @mmurraypolitics Yes, heaven forbid the @Senate_GOPs actually do the job they get a tax-payer funded salary for.
698635252877672450 2016-02-13 22:29:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire And who in their right mind thinks Cruz or Trump should pick next Justice. Citizens United would look like child's play
698634824748306432 2016-02-13 22:28:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @greenfield64 if a Dem POTUS gets to fill the spot, we may finally be able to give elections back to the people & not billionaires
698634245896564744 2016-02-13 22:25:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @LukeRussert @mmurraypolitics this is one reason why the election is so vital. A GOP POTUS would make this court even more political
698633628805369857 2016-02-13 22:23:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @conncarroll hypocrisy of the @Senate_GOP is breathtaking. Imagine if it was a Rep POTUS. This Senate is a nat'l disgrace
698633145604767744 2016-02-13 22:21:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @BuzzFeedAndrew @conncarroll because the @Senate_GOPs care only about power/party not the country or even doing their jobs
698632724710584320 2016-02-13 22:19:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops Now is an opportunity for @Senate_GOPs to act like grown-ups and show bi-partisanship to appoint a Justice. Finally put country over party
698632297633939456 2016-02-13 22:18:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @Miles0255 @BuzzFeedAndrew @meghankwelsh @FoxNews @GOP they would be screaming and gnashing their teeth if the Dems did that to a Rep POTUS
698631824646545410 2016-02-13 22:16:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @charlescwcooke And it starts already. @GOP yet again with their governing by obstruction
698631141184688129 2016-02-13 22:13:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @meghankwelsh @FoxNews Obama gets to appoint a Justice. Wonder how the @GOP is going to try and stop that
698630566430830593 2016-02-13 22:11:21 UTC <Bearnmind> So sad to hear Supreme Court Justice Scalia has died

697996832895582208 2016-02-11 04:13:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix That it bothers you is unsettling.
697996456867852288 2016-02-11 04:11:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @Faytte @BernieSanders I appreciate the courtesy, it's often in short supply in Twitter. I respect your opinion and your choice
697996150054481920 2016-02-11 04:10:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @WLOX This is so tragic. They are in my prayers
697995844063272960 2016-02-11 04:09:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel One of @BernieSanders least attractive qualities. Lots of negativity (fair) but acts like he doesn't (shady)
697994963720785920 2016-02-11 04:05:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller Um she ran against him when he was a Senator, didn't @BernieSanders flirt with running against him as a sitting POTUS in 2012?
697994351234936832 2016-02-11 04:03:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @rickwtyler @JohnJHarwood what's his position on whether or not the draft should be reinstated?
697994211954683904 2016-02-11 04:02:42 UTC <Bearnmind> Watch democratic debate for in-depth discussion of issues; watch Repub debate for the train wreck and to get scared out of your mind
697993589280927744 2016-02-11 04:00:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @Faytte @BernieSanders Not a fan of HRC but I'm not feeling the Bern. I'm looking at this election which candidate is the lesser evil
697993147687821312 2016-02-11 03:58:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @Faytte @BernieSanders I was a rep for 30 years, voted Obama twice, not sure who I'm going to vote for this time.
697992768178798592 2016-02-11 03:56:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix It's not a game. What gives with the media; pre-game intros, half-time shows, post game analysis. I expect better from you guys
697992419334365184 2016-02-11 03:55:35 UTC <Bearnmind> Have to say I agree - @BernieSanders is a 1-2 issue candidate. Weak in foreign policy and economy #DemDebate
697992184289759234 2016-02-11 03:54:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @HillaryClinton killed that closing statement. Sanders came off as cantankerous uncle stuck on repeat. #DemDebate

697991511628238849 2016-02-11 03:51:59 UTC <Bearnmind> Just asking, when has @BernieSanders ever brought people together? He says it but never gives examples of when he has  #DemDebate
697991017895759874 2016-02-11 03:50:01 UTC <Bearnmind> Gotta say I'm coming out of this debate liking @BernieSanders less than I did coming in #DemDebate
697990392827002880 2016-02-11 03:47:32 UTC <Bearnmind> When it comes down to brass tacks, @BernieSanders is just a typical politician. Makes promises he knows he can't keep #DemDebate
697990175272673282 2016-02-11 03:46:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @BernieSanders is fundamentally dishonest. He's an Independent but won't run as one because he wants the DNC infrastructure #DemDebate
697989764167946240 2016-02-11 03:45:02 UTC <Bearnmind> um @BernieSanders - you can't have those things without a dem congress which isnt going to happen anytime soon. Be realistic #DemDebate
697989479580233729 2016-02-11 03:43:54 UTC <Bearnmind> So Bernie's influence would be FDR? #DemDebate
697989134124711936 2016-02-11 03:42:32 UTC <Bearnmind> I wonder how many of HRC haters can actually say why they hate her/think that she lies without resorting to soundbites/rumors #DemDebate
697988050115235840 2016-02-11 03:38:13 UTC <Bearnmind> Everything with @BernieSanders is "we have a lot of work to do" and then no specifics  #DemDebate
697987713824329728 2016-02-11 03:36:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @BernieSanders making no sense with his foreign policy answers. Just throwing words together. Definitely one of his weakest areas #DemDebate
697986416006008833 2016-02-11 03:31:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel Do they even know who he is. That was a terrible answer by @BernieSanders #DemDebate
697986201178017793 2016-02-11 03:30:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @BernieSanders is weak in foreign policy. It's dangerous when you can't admit what you don't know esp in such a critical area #DemDebate
697985599932915713 2016-02-11 03:28:29 UTC <Bearnmind> Hillary voted for the Iraq war. She said she made a mistake. People learn and grow. I admire a politician that can admit it #DemDebate
697985160537624576 2016-02-11 03:26:44 UTC <Bearnmind> Again with the Iraq vote. @BernieSanders that is not a validation of your qualification in foreign policy. #DemDebate
697984816889856000 2016-02-11 03:25:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @zachjd0809 The media has failed in their basic responsibility to be fair arbitrators of facts. They are so in the tank for Trump #DemDebate
697984369093386240 2016-02-11 03:23:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @BernieSanders foreign policy answer is just a word salad. #DemDebate
697984195948388352 2016-02-11 03:22:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @BernieSanders biggest contributors are labor unions. I'm sure they expect nothing in return #DemDebate
697983930239156224 2016-02-11 03:21:51 UTC <Bearnmind> It aggravates the crap out of me that @BernieSanders thinks his vote against the Iraq war qualifies him in foreign policy #DemDebate
697983708742209537 2016-02-11 03:20:58 UTC <Bearnmind> No matter how you look at it Bernie spent decades in Congress and has little foreign policy knowledge #DemDebate
697982874658725889 2016-02-11 03:17:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @zachjd0809 indicative of how the media views this election as a "game". Game time intros, half-time shows & post-game analysis #DemDebate
697982467077238784 2016-02-11 03:16:02 UTC <Bearnmind> I'd rather have a politician say what they can realistically get done as opposed to promising what they know is impossible  #DemDebate

697979789894950913 2016-02-11 03:05:24 UTC <Bearnmind> Seriously don't get why @BernieSanders isn't running as an independent. That's just shady.  #DemDebate

697967944127684608 2016-02-11 02:18:20 UTC <Bearnmind> Bernie's view on healthcare is simplistic. Even with a dem POTUS and Congress, single payer couldn't pass.  #DemDebate

697964817244647425 2016-02-11 02:05:54 UTC <Bearnmind> And Bernie stats out yelling. Please use your inside voice #DemDebate
697875915792113665 2016-02-11 20:12:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum that stream was painful to listen to
697874846148116484 2016-02-11 20:08:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @WaPoSean um, why is this news
697874664752865280 2016-02-11 20:07:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire Here I thought there was a separation of church and state
697874280814608384 2016-02-11 20:06:09 UTC <Bearnmind> Tragic. Prayers for his family and the communityhttps://twitter.com/breaking911/status/697867271662915584
697873868178980866 2016-02-11 20:04:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller dispel or dispense?
697654966866092032 2016-02-10 05:34:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @DickmanJeremy Nailed it.
697654504645402624 2016-02-10 05:32:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @beerdist she must be trying to fill the crazy as loon, I'm a moron seat left open by Michelle Bachman #Oregonstandoff
697653341187399680 2016-02-10 05:28:12 UTC <Bearnmind> Remind me which commandment gives gun rights? My bible is missing that one :) #OregonStandoff
697652993760608256 2016-02-10 05:26:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @VoteFiore will forget about these idiots as soon as the opportunity for free publicity vanishes. #OregonStandoff
697651784110731264 2016-02-10 05:22:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @kookamuffin @VoteFiore Please let them arrest her
697650515002421249 2016-02-10 05:16:59 UTC <Bearnmind> These people are shocked actions have consequences. Yep, terrorists go to jail. #Oregonstandoff
697649283844145152 2016-02-10 05:12:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @BecketAdams @BuzzFeedAndrew Isn't Michele Fiore the Assemblywoman who did the family w/guns xmas card? She will do anything for publicity
697648525191094272 2016-02-10 05:09:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @BecketAdams @BuzzFeedAndrew this stream is just an avenue for them to whine, complain and bitch. Actions have consequences.
697648099645382656 2016-02-10 05:07:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @BecketAdams @BuzzFeedAndrew Listening to these guys, I get the impression they have realized there are consequences
697640369551441920 2016-02-10 04:36:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Disgraceful
697640152299130880 2016-02-10 04:35:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP Per the stream, these guys had to break the law to exercise their 1st amendment rights + Obama wants their guns + Obamacare. Bullshit
697639580795801602 2016-02-10 04:33:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @Breaking911 So listening to the feed, the guys had to break the law because Obama wants their guns? The radio guys are just milking this
697634534649683968 2016-02-10 04:13:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @PatrickSvitek there are no depths too low for @realDonaldTrump to sink to
697633692093652992 2016-02-10 04:10:08 UTC <Bearnmind> So sad. Prayers for the familyhttps://twitter.com/thomasmorstead/status/697612758431305728
697633248344739840 2016-02-10 04:08:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @evanmcsan @BuzzFeedAndrew @EvanMcSan @BuzzFeedNews This can't be true, @BernieSanders is against super-pads so I'm sure he'll denounce them
697632934073888769 2016-02-10 04:07:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedNews @BuzzFeed what rights exactly is she standing up for again?
697632173327720449 2016-02-10 04:04:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @nycsouthpaw @chrislhayes True but that doesn't mean these guys don't have to face the consequences of their actions.
697631583952617473 2016-02-10 04:01:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmfa Between Cruz and anti-Semitic rhetoric and Trump and white supremacist groups, they are promoting hate in the pursuit of power
697630531849207808 2016-02-10 03:57:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @WLOX Good, these guys are criminals and need to be treated as such
697630166634405888 2016-02-10 03:56:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @Breaking911 these guys are panicked because they're going to be held accountable for their actions. This is bullshit.
697629843480014854 2016-02-10 03:54:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum they want to "take back their land". Doesn't that land belong to Native Americans? So they want to take back land that was stolen
697629189273419776 2016-02-10 03:52:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum these people need to go to jail. They broke the law now they're whining about facing the consequences. Zero sympathy for them
697626255353634816 2016-02-10 03:40:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @BravoWWHL @Andy Seriously with this Teresa comes home. She's a felon not a returning hero. So disappointed in @Bravotv. This feels slimy
697625370011529216 2016-02-10 03:37:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @BravoWWHL @Andy I get ratings but putting a convicted felon back on RHONJ? Scraping the bottom with that one. Let that show die already
697624471461568512 2016-02-10 03:33:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Is he going to be riding a white horse?
697624360488726532 2016-02-10 03:33:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @BravoWWHL "this whole legal thing" - Teresa Guidice. You mean the whole mortgage fraud thing that sent you to prison? Take responsibility.
697621902119014400 2016-02-10 03:23:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @BravoWWHL Teresa still won't take responsibility for her actions. Not sure why everyone congratulates her for getting out of prison.
697540147777245184 2016-02-10 21:58:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @josh_balmer @OakCliffCowboy @PeteDominick @HouseGOP isn't that what the primary process basically is?
697539884517625856 2016-02-10 21:57:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @josh_balmer @OakCliffCowboy @PeteDominick @HouseGOP agreed if everyone was asked for one. it started with Obama. Wonder why?
697504435359064065 2016-02-10 19:36:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN Please stop with the debate countdown clock. No one other than you is breathless with anticipation. A 30 hour countdown is just dumb
697503782096265217 2016-02-10 19:33:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @manymagees @Realitytea @erikajayne I agree but again why not just tell the truth and leave it at that. I had hoped she would be different.
697503484791365632 2016-02-10 19:32:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @fxnopinion Trump is getting only 20- 38% of the 1/2 of eligible voters who actually vote in primaries
697501280613363713 2016-02-10 19:23:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @manymagees @Realitytea @erikajayne She was fast becoming my favorite. It was disappointing. Why not just say she said it? Why lie?
697500796259274752 2016-02-10 19:22:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @samsteinhp why won't Bernie stand on his ideals and take the public funding option then?
697500595415052289 2016-02-10 19:21:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @JakeSherman @realDonaldTrump @NYDailyNews @politico He can feel good only by putting others down. Won't play well internationally
697500005133897728 2016-02-10 19:18:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @samsteinhp I believe Bernie is passionate and honest. I don't think he has a chance to get any of his ideas through GOP Congress.
697499721422733312 2016-02-10 19:17:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins not comforting at all. This can't be the best both parties have to offer. Our toxic politics scare off the good ones
697499288109244419 2016-02-10 19:16:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @manymagees @Realitytea @erikajayne I think she said she didn't tell her and then admitted she lied in her talking head. I expected more
697499025776472064 2016-02-10 19:15:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @OakCliffCowboy @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP I don't either if there is a reason to question it but not as a political red herring
697496600567017472 2016-02-10 19:05:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea I lost respect for @erikajayne last night. She seemed like a straight shooter but didn't own her actions and lied. Typical
697495201506525186 2016-02-10 18:59:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP Lucky us
697495138130653184 2016-02-10 18:59:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @ezraklein By his reasoning Timothy McVeigh's entire family should have been killed.
697494510918635520 2016-02-10 18:57:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @ezraklein And he's proud of it. I worry we're in danger of becoming what we criticize in other countries. Losing the moral high ground
697493941327917056 2016-02-10 18:54:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @OakCliffCowboy @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP But the issue is why was he even asked? There was no valid reason to question his birth
697493528549703680 2016-02-10 18:53:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @Pikajew1234 @pikajew1234 @daveweigel Um, ok?
697493400753455104 2016-02-10 18:52:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @OakCliffCowboy @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP No one had been asked to produce a birth cert before Obama. It was nonsense
697493100957167617 2016-02-10 18:51:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @OakCliffCowboy @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP Cruz and Obama circumstances are not similar. Obama born in US to an American citizen
697489012383215616 2016-02-10 18:35:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @OakCliffCowboy @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP Obama was a natural born citizen. It was a made up issue. I agree Cruz's is complicated
697484774630367232 2016-02-10 18:18:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @AlecMacGillis @mmurraypolitics the Supreme Court has been political activists. No institution hasn't been damaged by our toxic politics
697483828143726592 2016-02-10 18:14:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @TrumpRice @BuzzFeedAndrew In what world are Mica and Joe considered to be reporters? Biased TV political pundits not reporters
697483246783897600 2016-02-10 18:12:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @OakCliffCowboy @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP Born in the US to an American mother. The whole issue was BS by the GOP
697482655693217793 2016-02-10 18:09:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @OakCliffCowboy @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP I disagree with that premise. His citizenship was a false flag raised by GOP.
697471816227495936 2016-02-10 17:26:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @OakCliffCowboy @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP I guess that's one school of thought. But why would his birth even be questioned?
697467394294468608 2016-02-10 17:09:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel There are no good options on either side. This is an election of the lesser evil. Damage to the country is inevitable.
697463662752198656 2016-02-10 16:54:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @JoeNBC @DylanByers going with the best defense is a good offense option I see. You're obsequious with Trump. Answer the question.
697462944595111936 2016-02-10 16:51:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @BKcolin @daveweigel @JoeNBC @DylanByers ooh, touched a nerve. Best defense is a good offense. It's not like Morning Joe gets good ratings
697462474958860288 2016-02-10 16:49:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @morningjoemsnbc They aren't bound by journalistic integrity. They're nothing more than mouthpieces for the GOP.
697457483103760384 2016-02-10 16:29:56 UTC <Bearnmind> Love Lippmann polish.https://twitter.com/deborahlippmann/status/697455773060825090
697456632490565634 2016-02-10 16:26:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP It's my opinion. No POTUS has been treated with such disrespect, loyalty and birth questioned
697456370589835264 2016-02-10 16:25:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP is this the 2 wrongs make a right? Bush's budget and presentation was accepted w/respect.
697455828949983232 2016-02-10 16:23:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @DylanByers @brianstelter @JoeNBC @morningmika No surprise they kiss Trump ass . No one expects integrity from Joe or Mika.
697455213637189632 2016-02-10 16:20:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew The water boarding/frat house was enough to convince me Trump, Jr didn't fall far from the tree. He's an idiot
697454291406163969 2016-02-10 16:17:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP like him or not, he was elected by majority of voters and deserves basic respect given to the office
697454091593760769 2016-02-10 16:16:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP It's a common courtesy as a sign of respect for the office. Obama is the only one treated that way
697453675422334976 2016-02-10 16:14:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP it's not the voting process. The normal decorum when the annual budget is presented was denied by GOP
697452165498019840 2016-02-10 16:08:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @nycsouthpaw @BuzzFeedBen @maggieNYT interesting point.
697451861800910848 2016-02-10 16:07:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan It wasn't a vote, it was the presentation of the annual budget.
697451097187872770 2016-02-10 16:04:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @josh_balmer @PeteDominick @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan Not at all. Years of decorum related to annual budget ignored because it was from Obama
697413061867601920 2016-02-10 13:33:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattyglesias @BuzzFeedBen @ezraklein No foreign policy expertise, xenophobia, misogyny, & bigotry. You're right, there be no difference
697412490913824768 2016-02-10 13:31:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @PeteDominick the lack of common courtesy towards Obama by the @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan is appalling. Racism is alive and well in Congress
697411892097241088 2016-02-10 13:28:47 UTC <Bearnmind> Finally the @HouseGOP and @SpeakerRyan show themselves for the racists they are. http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/obama-budget-snubbed-by-congress
697278959285886977 2016-02-09 04:40:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc Love how @mitchellreports talks about conventional wisdom underestimating Sanders/Trump like she's not part of conventional wisdom
697276178021949445 2016-02-09 04:29:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio @BuzzFeedAndrew I will be reprogrammed to eliminate repetition and the tendency to panic when confronted by obstacles
697275778367516674 2016-02-09 04:27:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @Milbank @politicalwire You nailed it.  IA and NH voters did  fail to vet but the media blinded by celebrity/a great story also failed
697273091819491328 2016-02-09 04:17:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes That's part of the problem. Media loves this so they aren't doing their job. Trump owns the media and they keep pandering
697272380624936960 2016-02-09 04:14:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes No more beta testing, time to deploy the latest version of the Marco-bot
697271769372221441 2016-02-09 04:11:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood A wall to keep Americans in if Trump wins.
697271433395900416 2016-02-09 04:10:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @ezraklein Replacing it with what exactly?  Something great? Huge?
697271270585581568 2016-02-09 04:10:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins Trump got 34% of the vote. More people voted against him than for him.
697270922068234240 2016-02-09 04:08:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @jbarro @JohnJHarwood Trump is the American version of Putin.
697269964269613058 2016-02-09 04:04:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood The man is delusional. He can't even give specifics just that he'll be great. He's an egotistical demagogue
697268524063006720 2016-02-09 03:59:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @eisingerj @JohnJHarwood Trump blatantly lies. Either his voters believe he's just lying to everyone else or ...I have no idea why
697267874101125120 2016-02-09 03:56:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter there are no repercussions for him lying so he just continues to do it. Not sure why his voters think he isn't lying to them
697267401189126144 2016-02-09 03:54:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @kwcollins @ezraklein he's proved that bigotry, misogyny and bullying are alive and well in the US.
697265388044881920 2016-02-09 03:46:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio eyes and ears are red. Signs of the anxiety he struggles with. His programming falters when confronted with obstacles
697264848523173889 2016-02-09 03:44:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel his national unfavorables, lies (35 % unemploy) & his name recognition I don't see him changing enough minds to be elected
697263580505317377 2016-02-09 03:39:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @secupp And looks disastrous for the country but all she cares about is a R is elected. GOP put party before country #toxic
697263159866998784 2016-02-09 03:37:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller He's toast but Kaisch and Bush appreciate him playing
697262955247886337 2016-02-09 03:36:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew Rehabbing an image is tough work.
697262793708466176 2016-02-09 03:36:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @RHallow_Times @chucktodd More people vote against him than for him; huge net unfavorability nationally but the media lets him run them over
697262010963271680 2016-02-09 03:33:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @RexAlley @rexalley @brianstelter @DanaBashCNN Just have to agree to disagree.
697261783971659778 2016-02-09 03:32:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @stuartpstevens @mckaycoppins @marcorubio His campaign staff is going to reboot him to eliminate glitches.
697261418891059201 2016-02-09 03:30:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @MSNBC @msnbc @cnn @FoxNews Trump just makes up unemployment #s, no specifics, phones in interviews. Do your jobs - quit pandering and vet him
697260683487006720 2016-02-09 03:27:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes I like Kaisch. The only Republican I would consider voting for
697260302610624513 2016-02-09 03:26:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @RexAlley @rexalley @brianstelter @DanaBashCNN I understood your point but I disagree about media being anti-Trump. More free press, no real vetting
697239504181141504 2016-02-09 02:03:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @maddow Rachel is the only adult on this broadcast. Keeping things in perspective as opposed to wild speculation. @Lawrence take note.
697238738804539393 2016-02-09 02:00:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum Thank you for not either singing to the angels or predicting the apocalypse. Unbiased level headed journalism in short supply.
697238466044764162 2016-02-09 01:59:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc - all doom/gloom for Clinton campaign based on history. Um, nothing in this election cycle has gone according to history #getagrip
697237982668058624 2016-02-09 01:57:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @bruuklin1 @greenfield64 The media driven narrative needs to stop. It's 2 small states that have a history of being wrong
697237679768018944 2016-02-09 01:56:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @mkraju @BuzzFeedAndrew @AlexConant @CNN basically admitting that @marcorubio can't win on his own. The marcobot better hope for a VP slot
697236474530566144 2016-02-09 01:51:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @RexAlley @rexalley @brianstelter @DanaBashCNN I see your point but IA and NH not always a good indicator
697236268959338503 2016-02-09 01:50:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @ezraklein @cnn Trump is the American Putin. Weird how we vilify Putin but the GOP is doing its best to elect someone just like him.
697229405182103552 2016-02-09 01:23:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix Bloomberg runs and the GOP candidate which God help us could be Trump/Cruz wins. Bloomberg won't win but will split democratic vote
697226924146487296 2016-02-09 01:13:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @costareports and experience and capability to govern and the ability to unite. Even more toxic politics ahead
697226633850261505 2016-02-09 01:12:38 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins It's not a good feeling. Trump is appealing to the worst in us. Sanders to the idealism. Neither can unite this country
697226324872720384 2016-02-09 01:11:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @DanaBashCNN This is just 1 state. NH is not the entire country.
697220892070428672 2016-02-09 00:49:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd @MSNBC NH is not the whole country so saying that the "country" has decided is overreach. IA and NH are the 1st of many primaries
697220566068162561 2016-02-09 00:48:31 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Wow, did Steve Schmidt just reveal that you guys know the result and are just holding it for ratings? He seemed certain Trump won big
697219660555669504 2016-02-09 00:44:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Watching Brian Williams I find that I like him much less than before. He appears insincere & trying too hard. Hard to watch
697216959570714625 2016-02-09 00:34:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix IMHO, Congress and their ineptness caused anti-establishment lean. Ironic the @HouseGOP is the cause & Trump/Cruz is the result
697215996319440896 2016-02-09 00:30:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel Wishful thinking.
697215669159460864 2016-02-09 00:29:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire And the country will suffer
697215458395738112 2016-02-09 00:28:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Don't you torture us enough each day with @morningjoemsnbc? Why are they on now? Do you hate your viewers that much?
697213728962572289 2016-02-09 00:21:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @michaelbd @chrislhayes how terrifying it is for the future of our country that some voters believe we could survive a Trump presidency
697213250006601729 2016-02-09 00:19:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix @ethanklapper The @GOP candidates have revealed the dark underside of Americans. They must be so proud
697212797713846277 2016-02-09 00:17:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire Lord help us all
697212645271846913 2016-02-09 00:17:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @imillhiser Does anyone still believe that the Supreme Court isn't political? Our toxic politics are destroying the country
697206862857531392 2016-02-09 23:54:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics NH voters figure they have can vote their heart not head because the rest of the country will vote their head and fix it
697205575982149632 2016-02-09 23:48:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics Small % of voters in IA and NH have outsized impact on nomination thanks to hype. Seldom reflect rest of country.
697205160175607808 2016-02-09 23:47:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd I miss Tim Russert. You could trust what he said and he kept a level head. I think he'd be shocked at what media has become now.
697203833613762560 2016-02-09 23:42:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter  Stelter Is one of the few reporters I trust. In 2008, I trusted most of them. MSM more political pundits vs journalists now
697203021810417666 2016-02-09 23:38:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNPolitics needs a shake-up in their pundit line-up. Borger, et al say the same thing each time, boring and tired. Need new blood.
697182785791004672 2016-02-09 22:18:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood the heartlessness of these voters is breathtaking
697182631880953856 2016-02-09 22:17:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew where did he his self-proclaimed "foreign policy expertise". No show at work, no achievements, no bills, so from a book?

696824688077643776 2016-02-08 22:35:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @McCormackJohn @BuzzFeedAndrew And the polls were so accurate in Iowa. The only person paying attention to polls is Trump.
696824060236427266 2016-02-08 22:32:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump is proving to be quite the politician. Calls McCain a loser in July 2015 and denies he ever said it in Feb 2016. #notrump
696700149922426881 2016-02-08 14:20:34 UTC <Bearnmind> Interesting.  Read it w/a grain of salt. @marcorubio Marco Rubio: Poor Little Rich Boy Runs Into Real Estate Troublehttp://observer.com/2016/01/poor-little-rich-boy

696173907963879424 2016-02-06 03:29:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @HillaryClinton Yeah, I don't think that statement is completely accurate

695455904703995904 2016-02-04 03:56:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @GayPatriot @politico I don't see an article in politico as the arbitrator of truth. research multiple sources not a right leaning mag
695454441193902081 2016-02-04 03:50:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @GayPatriot completely disagree but I appreciate you sharing your opinion with me
695449564719898624 2016-02-04 03:31:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix gotta love @GOP  gerrymandering and voter suppression #everyvotecounts
695443644052967425 2016-02-04 03:07:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @BernieSanders Experience doesn't matter in foreign policy. What matters is that I voted against the war in Iraq.
695442057431613440 2016-02-04 03:01:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger @BernieSanders is so weak on foreign policy. The issues facing this country are not just domestic.
695440225171070976 2016-02-04 02:54:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @mviser @brianstelter His yelling is off putting. Volume doesn't increase comprehension
695439899231547392 2016-02-04 02:52:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @AndrewNBCNews @mmurraypolitics @chucktodd @HillaryClinton this is such a non-issue to me as a voter.
695366671825920003 2016-02-04 22:01:48 UTC <Bearnmind> I don't like @ChrisChristie but he is right about @marcorubio.  He's accomplished nothing but mis-use of gov't fundshttps://twitter.com/zekejmiller/status/695356182391685120
695366104428843008 2016-02-04 21:59:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrismassie @BuzzFeedAndrew @marcorubio he was a lobbyist but now he wasn't a lobbyist. This man has more positions than the Kama Sutra
695364920511082496 2016-02-04 21:54:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood the more people the less time for him to be a target.
695364635952697345 2016-02-04 21:53:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @CarlyFiorina I wish she would go quietly.
695363032839376896 2016-02-04 21:47:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood Rubio never lets facts stand in his way. @marcorubio has accomplished nothing but he wants to be POTUS? He just wants the pay.
694866204507422720 2016-02-03 12:53:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @CharliesNailArt Just sent the email through your site. Thanks
694616364900880384 2016-02-02 20:20:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @maddow The big news out of last night seems to be that Trump can be gracious when he loses, at least for 1 night
694616127369039872 2016-02-02 20:19:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @tedcruz says he's making his case to the American people. Not true, he's making his case to the 20-30% of GOP voters who vote in primaries
694615700854415360 2016-02-02 20:17:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio is excited because he's the least of 3 evils. The majority of GOP voters don't want him, they just want Cruz and Trump less
694610427725111298 2016-02-02 19:56:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire not surprisingly the only one freaking out over polls are the media and Trump.
694610020202340352 2016-02-02 19:55:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio is not qualified His tenure in Florida marked by finance scandals; as a 1st term Senator he's done nothing- not even show up
694609500024750080 2016-02-02 19:53:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio has an outsized ego. He needs to "wait his turn" because he doesn't have a proved record of accomplishing anything
694594815628021761 2016-02-02 18:54:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump and still couldn't pull of a win. More people voted against you than for you
694594703937949698 2016-02-02 18:54:17 UTC <Bearnmind> Unfair treatment by the media? This man gets more free media than anyone. He's not just a loser, he's a whiny loserhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/694559410488737793
694593831854051332 2016-02-02 18:50:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew I generally do the exact opposite of anything Palin does  and I'm guessing I'm in the majority here
694593375987732480 2016-02-02 18:49:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @DWongDC I'm sure his endorsement will have as much of an impact as Palin's - none
694592290740944896 2016-02-02 18:44:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @CharliesNailArt my order (#2940) shipped on 1/19 but a I haven't received it yet. Do you know the approximate shipping times? Thanks
694374108222611456 2016-02-01 04:17:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @DrJasonJohnson @chrislhayes the media trying to regain some control.  They were caught flat-footed by Trump who owned them
694373741694971904 2016-02-01 04:16:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd His hard right and refusal to acknowledge separation of church and state will hurt him in a general election
694373252228055042 2016-02-01 04:14:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter No matter how you feel about HRC, on a personal level it takes a spine of steel to take the abuse she gets and keep going
694372540395954176 2016-02-01 04:11:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @CNN @chucktodd @cnn @msnbc Guess that Palin endorsement didn't help, after all.
694371682165874688 2016-02-01 04:08:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew now the GOP is really going to panic at the prospect of Cruz
694371446462771200 2016-02-01 04:07:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @RyanLizza but everyone remembers who didn't win.  That would be you. Since you hate losers, you must be hating yourself
694367195216875520 2016-02-01 03:50:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller He's going to need it. He's getting ready to become Trump's whipping boy.
694366544785203200 2016-02-01 03:47:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @ezraklein His refusal to acknowledge that one of our founding principles is separation of church and state is troubling
694366145785303040 2016-02-01 03:46:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix @sinderbrand I can't wait. By definition, he's a Loser.
694365957226127361 2016-02-01 03:45:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @JessicaTaylor @JohnJHarwood He's taking a page from the Trump handbook - If you say it, you make it true.
694365680838299649 2016-02-01 03:44:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller Said Huckabee and Santorium. How'd that work out? @marcorubio needs to learn sincere humility.
694365383004921864 2016-02-01 03:43:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianbeutler @chrislhayes and cloyingly insincere in his profession of faith. @marcorubio is a robot.
694365155182927872 2016-02-01 03:42:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller sounded like he said "when I are our nominee"
694365003030360064 2016-02-01 03:41:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @ezraklein He's just optimistic. There are no good options here, just the least bad option. Marco - "when I are our nominee??"
694364545612128256 2016-02-01 03:39:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @mmurraypolitics @marcorubio say people said he had no chance because he was too optimistic? Who said that? I would hardly call him sunny
694360605172633600 2016-02-01 03:24:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd and still a majority of GOP voters prefer someone else. Iowa doesn't have the best track record of predicting winners
694359941642067968 2016-02-01 03:21:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd As the pundits start losing their minds, let's remember who the last 2 winners of Iowa were - Huckabee and Santorium.
694359244171255808 2016-02-01 03:18:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @CNN @msnbc Doesn't this make @realDonaldTrump a loser?
694358283667247109 2016-02-01 03:14:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @costareports @AlexConant Quite the endorsement. They're all bad but Rubio is the least bad. That pretty much sums it up.
694144771628101632 2016-02-01 13:06:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN is killing me with their countdown clocks #Election2016

693193463077191681 2016-01-29 22:06:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @politico It seems like more and more the media is the story. I thought that was a journalistic no-no
693192748220968960 2016-01-29 22:03:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @arappeport @mckaycoppins Harsh but I see his point (that hurt to say)
693191371973398528 2016-01-29 21:57:56 UTC <Bearnmind> @Shoq @PeteDominick The media and politicians have become so intertwined, factual, unbiased reporting is a thing of the past. Clicks > truth
693190878467379200 2016-01-29 21:55:58 UTC <Bearnmind> That's lame. His foreign policy expertise must not include like actual knowledge of foreign countries.https://twitter.com/zekejmiller/status/693188050692788224
693190475101179904 2016-01-29 21:54:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller translation - But he's a foreign policy expert. He does know that we're not a monarchy, right? First Norway, now Sweden
693189813814611968 2016-01-29 21:51:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @ajjaffe @mmurraypolitics well he should know, he's an expert in everything in his own mind.
693189549334380544 2016-01-29 21:50:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller Has he been around Palin? I hear stupidity is infectious
693189266499883010 2016-01-29 21:49:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @rickwtyler It was totally unfair to ask @tedcruz to defend his own words. He got busted and he's whining. Not a good look
693187610936791040 2016-01-29 21:42:59 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNPolitics @BuzzFeedAndrew @clayaiken @VP I get all my political advice from Clay but only if he sings it
693187453688102912 2016-01-29 21:42:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @AustinHunt @BuzzFeedBen Amazon must still be testing their drone delivery system
693187161076731904 2016-01-29 21:41:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @mattfleg @BuzzFeedAndrew Sad doesn't even begin to describe this depth of desperation
693186912874598400 2016-01-29 21:40:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @brianstelter @realDonaldTrump Must have been those voices in his head.
693186593742536705 2016-01-29 21:38:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @JuddLegum @smkeyes good thing @HouseGOP weren't on a political witch hunt or anything. She owned them in the hearing. #wasteoftaxpayerfunds
693185552506580992 2016-01-29 21:34:49 UTC <Bearnmind> Guess @realDonaldTrump missing the debate wasn't quite the ratings dud he predicted.https://twitter.com/passantino/status/693183013157376000
693185181977546752 2016-01-29 21:33:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @AndreaTantaros Of course she is
693184819560366080 2016-01-29 21:31:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew he's a Trump supporter - nuff said
693121963460534273 2016-01-29 17:22:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @RyanLizza @Trevornoah I watched it. You were very engaging.

692927485386833923 2016-01-28 04:29:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @thefix @politicalwire @TheFix @cnn The media needs Trump as much as he needs the media. Media bashing is justified here. #gopdebate
692925885977104384 2016-01-28 04:22:59 UTC <Bearnmind> Watching the debate I'm convinced more than ever that @realDonaldTrump would be disastrous for our country. #gopdebate
692924063380037633 2016-01-28 04:15:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN needs new pundits. The current ones say the same things over and over again. #gopdebate
692923397215502339 2016-01-28 04:13:06 UTC <Bearnmind> The debate showed what Trump brings to the table - insults, entertainment but no substance #gopdebate
692923071074803712 2016-01-28 04:11:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix @callumborchers the only people who are taking about Trump not being there is the media. #gopdebate
692922891248222213 2016-01-28 04:11:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN trying to convince everyone that Rubio won the debate. Just because you want it to be true doesn't make it so #gopdebate
692920613879554049 2016-01-28 04:02:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN Time for @cnn breaking news - The debate is over! Turn to CNN and yep   the breaking news chyron is scrolling. #cryingwolf #gopdebare
692919685684314112 2016-01-28 03:58:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio closing by pandering to evangelicals #GOPdebate
692919503974469633 2016-01-28 03:57:38 UTC <Bearnmind> Uh oh Ben Carson is closing with plagerism. #GOPDebate
692919321568395265 2016-01-28 03:56:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @ChrisChristie closing using 9/11 for political gain. Isn't what they criticized Clinton for doing? #GOPDebate
692917471645417473 2016-01-28 03:49:33 UTC <Bearnmind> Oh Ben, no one is listening to you #gopdebate
692916162666086400 2016-01-28 03:44:21 UTC <Bearnmind> Are we shunning now? #GOPDebate
692916099063635968 2016-01-28 03:44:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @stephenfhayes @ZekeJMiller @marcorubio is scared to take on @ChrisChristie in person. Causes flashbacks to the playground #gopdebate
692915358777413632 2016-01-28 03:41:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd Maybe wait until it's over to start the postmortem #gopdebate
692914938562658306 2016-01-28 03:39:29 UTC <Bearnmind> I gotta say, I haven't missed @realDonaldTrump at all. The debates are more substantive without him and the grownups get to talk #gopdebate
692914593618878465 2016-01-28 03:38:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @PeteDominick Thank you. That perfectly describes him. #GOPDebate
692914320804581379 2016-01-28 03:37:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller thank god, I thought it was just me #GOPDebate
692914195134832640 2016-01-28 03:36:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR plus fracking! Russia is a one trick country. And oil! #GOPDebate
692913897888747520 2016-01-28 03:35:21 UTC <Bearnmind> Ooohh Ben Carson learned some new foreign policy buzzwords. Sadly he doesn't know how to use them. #GOPDebate
692913533021995008 2016-01-28 03:33:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @RandPaul wants to give abortion back to the state but only if they do what he wants. Got it. Fake state rights #GOPDebate
692912811115220993 2016-01-28 03:31:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio is starting to sound unhinged. He does understand separation of church and state, doesn't he? #GOPDebate #republicandebate
692912560346103808 2016-01-28 03:30:02 UTC <Bearnmind> Trump should make @ChrisChristie his Secretary of Transportation  #GOPDebate #republicandebate
692911603512164352 2016-01-28 03:26:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @chucktodd and that has what to do with anything? #GOPDebate
692911069963120640 2016-01-28 03:24:07 UTC <Bearnmind> Those words are truer than anything he's ever said. @ChrisChristie knows nothing #GOPDebatehttps://twitter.com/johnjharwood/status/692910178446934016
692910899741466624 2016-01-28 03:23:26 UTC <Bearnmind> Why did it take so long for someone to say Benghazi?  I had that in GOP bingo. #GOPDebate
692910760540934146 2016-01-28 03:22:53 UTC <Bearnmind> But @marcorubio is a foreign policy expert. He tells himself that every day so it must be true #GOPDebatehttps://twitter.com/dylanmatt/status/692909839979266048
692910539891171328 2016-01-28 03:22:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @Tmangilley too funny
692910125611368449 2016-01-28 03:20:22 UTC <Bearnmind> Which is patently false and shows you he'll ignore facts and pander to get elected #GOPDebatehttps://twitter.com/johnjharwood/status/692909857016410112
692909942098038785 2016-01-28 03:19:38 UTC <Bearnmind> Chris - @tescruz you're a terrible human being and everyone hates you. I just wanted to get that off my chest. Now a question...#GOPDebate
692909472419815428 2016-01-28 03:17:46 UTC <Bearnmind> So far, neither Cruz or Rubio have helped themselves #GOPDebate #republicandebate
692909161173139462 2016-01-28 03:16:32 UTC <Bearnmind> Note to self - never accept a dinner invitation from Ben Carson, one of the guests is a terrorist #GOPDebate
692908519180374016 2016-01-28 03:13:59 UTC <Bearnmind> Nice try @ChrisChristie. Like you tell the truth. #GOPDebate
692908276997038085 2016-01-28 03:13:01 UTC <Bearnmind> Split screen Rubio/Cruz is like Ken doll/eric cartman #GOPDebate
692907879809052673 2016-01-28 03:11:26 UTC <Bearnmind> Split screen w/Cruz and Paul turns out poorly for @tedcruz #GOPDebate
692906817597345797 2016-01-28 03:07:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump must have got the heads up that there'd be video tonight. That's why he was scared to come #GOPDebate
692906530979647489 2016-01-28 03:06:05 UTC <Bearnmind> Watching @megynkelly tonight, you can see why @realDonaldTrump was scared to come. She's brutal + video! #GOPDebate #republicandebate.
692906100685955072 2016-01-28 03:04:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @ezraklein Our boy is becoming a man #GOPDebate #republicandebate
692905827099922433 2016-01-28 03:03:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio is fumbling this answer on immigration like the Arizona Cardinals #GOPDebate
692905571163467776 2016-01-28 03:02:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix because he's basically a decent human being. In this race that's a weakness #GOPDebate
692905367018274817 2016-01-28 03:01:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @megynkelly is antagonistic tonight. Clearly she is assuming the Trump role tonight. @marcorubio's face is red under his makeup #GOPDebate
692904937102151681 2016-01-28 02:59:45 UTC <Bearnmind> This is new. Showing videotape of a candidate lying during a debate. @marcorubio is so busted #GOPDebate
692904573888008192 2016-01-28 02:58:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio always sounds like he thinks he's dropping a knowledge bomb on stupid people when answers a question. #GOPDebate
692904061327249409 2016-01-28 02:56:16 UTC <Bearnmind> Like I said, @marcorubio lies #GOPDebatehttps://twitter.com/buzzfeedandrew/status/692903837154349057
692903851402346496 2016-01-28 02:55:26 UTC <Bearnmind> That cap and trade line bombed for @marcorubio. #GOPDebate
692903724684034048 2016-01-28 02:54:56 UTC <Bearnmind> Finally a climate change question. And @marcorubio starts lying and dodging #GOPDebate #republicandebate
692903195304132608 2016-01-28 02:52:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @ezraklein I disagree, that is Rand Paul
692903003603537921 2016-01-28 02:52:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller if only he had sounded like he was sincere instead of pandering #GOPDebate
692902718717988864 2016-01-28 02:50:56 UTC <Bearnmind> Stand back, @tedcruz has been asked for specifics on healthcare. His head is going to explode as he spews nonsense #GOPDebate
692902426295275520 2016-01-28 02:49:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @ChrisChristie pandering to evangelicals on the PP question. #GOPDebate
692901396866142210 2016-01-28 02:45:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @matthewjdowd @PaulBegala He's choking.

692900269454155776 2016-01-28 02:41:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @cfischet alcohol poisoning is sure to follow  #GOPDebate
692899940327124992 2016-01-28 02:39:53 UTC <Bearnmind> I'm a terrible person, Megyn Kelly saying "backdoor" made me giggle #GOPDebate #republicandebate
692899252419190784 2016-01-28 02:37:09 UTC <Bearnmind> Um @megynkelly you do know you're not debating right? #republicandebate
692898860801220608 2016-01-28 02:35:36 UTC <Bearnmind> Not a @RandPaul fan, but he comes across as sincere and truthful. #republicandebate
692898553228763137 2016-01-28 02:34:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio is like a Ken doll, plastic, boring and lacking real balls. #republicandebate
692898162101473281 2016-01-28 02:32:49 UTC <Bearnmind> Just not a fan of @megynkelly. #republicandebate
692897576148840449 2016-01-28 02:30:30 UTC <Bearnmind> Ooh @tedcruz is on the ropes and falling back on attacking the moderators. Again, this debate is no different w/o Trump #republicandebate
692897242571649024 2016-01-28 02:29:10 UTC <Bearnmind> I guess @tedcruz figures if he never stops talking the others can't attack him #republicandebate
692897009880035328 2016-01-28 02:28:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @tedcruz is throwing a temper tantrum. See the debate is no different without Trump #republicandebate
692896780065705989 2016-01-28 02:27:20 UTC <Bearnmind> The debate is attack Obama & Clinton. Why not just say what you'll do differently and how #republicandebate
692896418390913024 2016-01-28 02:25:54 UTC <Bearnmind> Only difference without Trump is more subtle insults and less facial contortions #republicandebate
692895869629140992 2016-01-28 02:23:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @TIME @marcorubio And ole @marcorubio has tons of experience with the military how again? He can't even show up for work #republicandebate
692895364131651586 2016-01-28 02:21:42 UTC <Bearnmind> Is this the first mention of Reagan?  They're slipping. #republicandebate
692894536993931266 2016-01-28 02:18:25 UTC <Bearnmind> Ben Carson. He's a smart Palin - word salads that show he's clueless, but uses real sentences. Plus he's actually smart #republicandebate
692893647990198273 2016-01-28 02:14:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio has been practicing that answer in the mirror. When he thinks it's an applause line, he talks faster & his voice gets high
692893305592348672 2016-01-28 02:13:32 UTC <Bearnmind> The last person who has a chance of bringing anyone together is @tedcruz. If everybody who knows you hates you....#republicandebate
692892892021420033 2016-01-28 02:11:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @Justin_Michel99 it's easier than trying to come up with an actual plan #republicandebate
692892608826245120 2016-01-28 02:10:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @DeidryAlvarez I think the scarier thing is that he isn't. #republicandebate
692892460830175233 2016-01-28 02:10:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @ChrisChristie wouldn't know a principle if it was stuck on a bridge in NJ #republicandebate
692892204746956802 2016-01-28 02:09:09 UTC <Bearnmind> C'mon guys, respect the bell #republicandebate
692892021065797633 2016-01-28 02:08:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @JebBush seems to have found a spine on the way to the debate. #republicandebate
692891783974367236 2016-01-28 02:07:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @marcorubio comes across as so  fake and insincere. I just can't with him #republicandebate
692890862234128384 2016-01-28 02:03:49 UTC <Bearnmind> So we're starting out not even bothering to answer the question #republicandebate
692890570268610560 2016-01-28 02:02:39 UTC <Bearnmind> @tedcruz looks nervous. Must be the Bulls-eye stamped on his forehead. #republicandebate
692889966188187650 2016-01-28 02:00:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @oceangeek @DomenicoNPR @BuzzFeedAndrew I feel your pain
692889262111326208 2016-01-28 01:57:28 UTC <Bearnmind> Anyone still believe @realDonaldTrump truly cares about veterans? A billionaire who gave $35k in 5 yearshttps://twitter.com/meetthepress/status/692888445320966145
692888385338216448 2016-01-28 01:53:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins how is the "money for veterans" being raised?  Donations?
692888058648113153 2016-01-28 01:52:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @Nate_Cohn @politicalwire all we can do is hope he loses. Instant karma.
692887645928558594 2016-01-28 01:51:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump - your concern for veterans appears to be extremely recent and fake. Veterans deserve betterhttps://twitter.com/woodruffbets/status/692885636362055680
692886946540949504 2016-01-28 01:48:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR exactly how is the money for veterans charities being raised?
692882533499871232 2016-01-28 01:30:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix I forgot he was still in the race. Another dream busted
692882155895025664 2016-01-28 01:29:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @peterleung @brianstelter @andersoncooper @CNN @AC360 You have good reporters and it does than an injustice for you to fawn over Trump
692881702369173505 2016-01-28 01:27:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @peterleung @brianstelter @andersoncooper @CNN @AC360 Enough with the fan-girling over Trump CNN, it's embarrassing
692875373567053824 2016-01-28 01:02:16 UTC <Bearnmind> Ooh, @oreillyfactor didn't like all the articles saying he "begged" Trump last night. The truth hurts. #republicandebate
692875022927425537 2016-01-28 01:00:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR @BuzzFeedAndrew Here's a horrible thought. What if Trump makes Palin his VP?  My eyes bleed at the prospect. #republicandebate
692874418238783489 2016-01-28 00:58:28 UTC <Bearnmind> How do we know Jim Gilmore isn't just some nutcase who walked in off the street? Just sayin' #republicandebate
692874088226787328 2016-01-28 00:57:10 UTC <Bearnmind> Too funny #republicandebatehttps://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/692873523157544966

692836664788385793 2016-01-28 22:28:27 UTC <Bearnmind> Don't air. It's just a stump speech and @CNN has aired numerous ones and will air it. CNN is all Trump all the timehttps://twitter.com/thefix/status/692806338066251776
692835596444635145 2016-01-28 22:24:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump  Shady. Your concern for veterans seems solely to excuse your fear of debating.https://twitter.com/gideonresnick/status/692804463720005632

692834972311289856 2016-01-28 22:21:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump At least use REAL US VETERANS when trying to score political points. Your concern seems insincerehttps://twitter.com/zekejmiller/status/692810782325735428

692833334624268288 2016-01-28 22:15:13 UTC <Bearnmind> Seriously @realDonaldTrump. Why are $ going to you instead of veterans charities? List the charities getting $https://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/692817768207482881

692192407841017856 2016-01-26 03:48:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @Hadas_Gold This shows why there was a need for the question she asked him about misogyny that started this in the 1st debate
692191670042017794 2016-01-26 03:45:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @Hadas_Gold @RyanLizza so Fox is taking a stand. Whodathunkit?  The hatred that Trump tweets daily and he can't take a joke?

692186720603889664 2016-01-26 03:25:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger The man seriously can't take criticism. Good thing no one criticizes POTUS. If elected Trump's head will explode
692186497244631042 2016-01-26 03:24:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @samsteinhp hopefully the media doesn't rise to bait. But I'm sure @CNN is already in negotiations with Trump to air his event
692186091315683329 2016-01-26 03:23:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @digby56 @PaulBegala @jbarro It's an "oh yeah?!" response from a bully who was made fun of in front of the class. Trump has a glass ego
692184848807628800 2016-01-26 03:18:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger does Trump ever talk about how he's going to accomplish what he promises. This race seems to be one long ego stroke
692184584709083136 2016-01-26 03:17:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @FoxNews @JamesHercher @daveweigel @gabrielsherman if @foxnews caves, they won't recover.
692183245081989122 2016-01-26 03:12:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire the media is doing exactly what Trump wants by talking about it. When a child throws a tantrum, you ignore it. Try that
692182495400443905 2016-01-26 03:09:01 UTC <Bearnmind> Hopefully the other candidates will  rip Trump apart at the debate.  I have to watch the debate just to see what happens.
692170379645837312 2016-01-26 02:20:53 UTC <Bearnmind> Watching @megynkelly show (as painful as it is), her syntax is strange
692168538816126979 2016-01-26 02:13:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller I call your trolling Fox and raise you veterans
692168372222566402 2016-01-26 02:12:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller Who writes this crap? Must be the Donald. Here's why I won't debate - because I'm rich and Fox made fun of me
692167488608542720 2016-01-26 02:09:23 UTC <Bearnmind> His ignorance is breathtaking and frighteninghttps://twitter.com/sfpelosi/status/692151135558332417
692167320689643520 2016-01-26 02:08:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @tedcruz is getting desperate to change the narrative
692166890307850240 2016-01-26 02:07:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @Cechase @jmartNYT @nytpolitics @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump He said it twice too
692166811887013889 2016-01-26 02:06:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @16campaignbites @jmartNYT @nytpolitics that's the funniest thing I've heard all day, thanks
692166566947995651 2016-01-26 02:05:44 UTC <Bearnmind> @greenfield64 he can't even deal with @megynkelly
692166410550771713 2016-01-26 02:05:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @daveweigel @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Cruz is very good at faking sincerity
692166258184314880 2016-01-26 02:04:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @brianstelter That's @FoxNews, becoming the story so they can cover the story for ratings. Good thing they aren't real news
692165873453391872 2016-01-26 02:02:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP_Politics @AP isn't there a law that says you can't generate your own news so you can cover yourself?  There should be 
692165397718630401 2016-01-26 02:01:05 UTC <Bearnmind> Hey @realDonaldTrump Cruz is challenging your manhood. You gonna let that stand?https://twitter.com/breaking911/status/692163264239763456
692145253755785216 2016-01-26 00:41:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC @msnbc just showed an ad for the GOP debate minus Trump.  I'm so watching the @FoxNews just to help their ratings #trumpTrump
692142309253763074 2016-01-26 00:29:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew or as a spoiled child scared of tough questions
692142097147793409 2016-01-26 00:28:29 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN would cover Trump's bowel movements if they could with John King illustrating a 3D map of Trump's colonhttps://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/692139085864013825
692141651666583553 2016-01-26 00:26:43 UTC <Bearnmind> One can only hopehttps://twitter.com/zekejmiller/status/692140082774540288
692141452474859521 2016-01-26 00:25:56 UTC <Bearnmind> I gotta say as much as I dislike @realDonaldTrump watching @FoxNews and Roger Ailes get owned by Trump is entertaining. Reap what you sow
692137244019310592 2016-01-26 00:09:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump So you get trolled epically by @FoxNews. Go to move is blackmail, if that doesn't work you'll take your ball and go home
692136817936695298 2016-01-26 00:07:31 UTC <Bearnmind> I can't tell if @FoxNews is proud or terrified of the monster they helped create in Donald Trump.
692136239168909312 2016-01-26 00:05:13 UTC <Bearnmind> Goody, racist Katrina Pierson is on @CNN. She's an awful person
692135990333444096 2016-01-26 00:04:14 UTC <Bearnmind> How funny is it watching @CNN cover @FoxNews
692135439692664835 2016-01-26 00:02:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @ErinBurnett Trump's announcement is not a bombshell, he says it every time. You don't have to add hype, he does that by himself
692134464852508674 2016-01-26 23:58:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @CNN @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Fox trolled Trump hard, made him look ridiculous so Trump is going to take his ball & go home
692134127122907138 2016-01-26 23:56:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN is having an orgasm over #DonaldTrump's "press" conference
692133927759257601 2016-01-26 23:56:02 UTC <Bearnmind> I may have to break my cardinal rule and watch @FoxNews and @megynkelly tonight just to see how they respond #DonaldTrump
692133083974361088 2016-01-26 23:52:41 UTC <Bearnmind> @the_brianjoyce too funny
692132675050672128 2016-01-26 23:51:03 UTC <Bearnmind> Please God let @FoxNews troll #DonaldTrump with another snarky press release
692131969598103554 2016-01-26 23:48:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @NoiseCollector_ @CNN @megynkelly You're right. It would be epic and I would so watch it
692131595810164736 2016-01-26 23:46:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @wolfblitzer Look at Wolf, making it all about himself
692131460434792450 2016-01-26 23:46:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @NoiseCollector_ @CNN @megynkelly that's funny (it really was). But Trump would be a disaster for this country.
692130618071764994 2016-01-26 23:42:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @KevinDonPorter I find it unfathomable that anyone thinks he's presidential material. He's an asshole throwing a tantrum on national Tv
692130262772236291 2016-01-26 23:41:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @NoiseCollector_ @CNN I'm watching a grown man throw a tantrum because he's scared of @megynkelly
692129833472626688 2016-01-26 23:39:46 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN These reporters need to grow backbones.
692129434791444480 2016-01-26 23:38:11 UTC <Bearnmind> Watching Trump on @CNN, I can't believe anyone is seriously thinking he is presidential material
692128372122591233 2016-01-26 23:33:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN roaming immigrant gangs?  This is yet another Trump stump speech with fictional facts and you give this shit prime time coverage??
692126965566935040 2016-01-26 23:28:22 UTC <Bearnmind> Clearly the press release from @FoxNews got under @realDonaldTrump's skin. He's a thin-skinned whiner
692126685932707840 2016-01-26 23:27:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN so basically you're broadcasting a Trump press conference where he answers no questions and gets a nat'l@stage to lobby insults.
692126103499055104 2016-01-26 23:24:56 UTC <Bearnmind> It's embarrassing how Trump bullies the media and they just let it happen. Guess journalism is truly dead @CNN @washingtonpost @nytpolitics
692125666708471811 2016-01-26 23:23:12 UTC <Bearnmind> A racist sheriff endorses Trump and @CNN broadcasts it as if it's a good thing. When I think CNN can't sink any lower they prove me wrong
692120790880354306 2016-01-26 23:03:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN Funny I don't remember Falwell or@Arpaio (so?) endorsements being breaking news or even televised in 2012. So why are they now?
692112320579948544 2016-01-26 22:30:10 UTC <Bearnmind> Gee @CNN do you cover every thing Trump does?  I expect a 3D graphic of his bowel movements along with John King and a map by next week
692102988920397824 2016-01-26 21:53:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @JenniferJJacobs @mmurraypolitics @realDonaldTrump @bobvanderplaats Trump goes after everyone. The man is a whiny baby. Why is this news?
692101374419570689 2016-01-26 21:46:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @DonaldJTrumpJr I guess being an asshole is an inherited trait.  Who knew?
692100289852264449 2016-01-26 21:42:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix @KFaulders I think it's hilarious
692100079063306241 2016-01-26 21:41:32 UTC <Bearnmind> Trump will show. That man needs publicity the way everyone needs air. Whiny babyhttps://twitter.com/thefix/status/692088790790377473
692057305475649536 2016-01-26 18:51:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix Judging on how Trump deals with criticism, does anyone honestly believe he wouldn't set a record for executive actions if elected?
692048173334945794 2016-01-26 18:15:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @BuzzFeedNews I am disappointed that the media isn't getting Trump. Has he bullied them into submission ?
692047698934026240 2016-01-26 18:13:23 UTC <Bearnmind> @BernieSanders how does your tax increase to pay for single payer impact veterans w/Tricare? Seems like their taxes go up w/o an offset
692034377291841536 2016-01-26 17:20:27 UTC <Bearnmind> I hate it when true breaking news happens when Ashley Banfield is on the air @CNN.
692032047213342721 2016-01-26 17:11:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix odd how the media is all over Clinton but not vetting Trump at all. Guess the media isn't afraid of her like they are of Trump.
691836300283006976 2016-01-25 04:13:22 UTC <Bearnmind> @BPratto I'm not offering an opinion, just noting that she was asked that question
691834711593869312 2016-01-25 04:07:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNNPolitics always the same pundits with the same answers. I can't even watch your political analysis anymore #DemTownHall
691833816273522689 2016-01-25 04:03:30 UTC <Bearnmind> She was asked that question and answered ithttps://twitter.com/bpratto/status/691833543480217602
691833549771706368 2016-01-25 04:02:26 UTC <Bearnmind> Gracious response by HRC to Sanders Ad and then Cuomo cuts her off when she starts to explain why she's a better candidate #DemTownHall
691832925294321666 2016-01-25 03:59:57 UTC <Bearnmind> 20 murdered children in Newtown, not one GOP Congressional investigation or dollars spent but Benghazi is worse than that? #DemTownHall
691832083682033664 2016-01-25 03:56:37 UTC <Bearnmind> The hatred for HRC. I can't even #DemTownHall
691831924852166657 2016-01-25 03:55:59 UTC <Bearnmind> When the person asking the questions looks like a serial killer...Tacky tweet I know  #DemTownHall
691831423062380545 2016-01-25 03:53:59 UTC <Bearnmind> The Dem debates are substantive; the Rep debates are crap but entertaining #DemTownHall
691830603390525441 2016-01-25 03:50:44 UTC <Bearnmind> I notice that no questions are asked by anyone definitely for or even leaning O'Malley. Do you think he's noticed? #DemTownHall
691830198849925124 2016-01-25 03:49:07 UTC <Bearnmind> 2 of 2 - HRC has to be twice as good as the men and look good doing it. That's a woman's issue that needs addressing #DemTownHall
691829821580640260 2016-01-25 03:47:37 UTC <Bearnmind> 1 of 2 - HRC is attacked on her looks, husband, laugh, hair, record and policies . None of the men have to deal with this. #DemTownHall
691824184998100992 2016-01-25 03:25:13 UTC <Bearnmind> Sad that CNN had to sandwich O'Malley in the middle to force people to ask him questions #DemTownHall
691823737763688449 2016-01-25 03:23:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN needs a new moderator. I've watched Cuomo on CNN in the morning and it's hard to take him seriously #DemTownHall
691822735589261312 2016-01-25 03:19:28 UTC <Bearnmind> Tacky question about the caucus from Chris Cuomo to O'Malley #DemTownHall
691821560571809792 2016-01-25 03:14:48 UTC <Bearnmind> Did O'Malley loosen his tie?  He means business.  #DemTownHall
691821196048990208 2016-01-25 03:13:21 UTC <Bearnmind> I'm sure O'Malley believes he could be POTUS but Congress would eat him alive #DemTownHall
691820160886378496 2016-01-25 03:09:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @KSWomen4Bernie Thanks. I appreciate that you tried.
691820005462253571 2016-01-25 03:08:37 UTC <Bearnmind> O'Malley trying to make the most of his one opportunity to get asked questions. But the optics and mannerisms seem insincere #DemTownHall
691819032694120448 2016-01-25 03:04:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @KSWomen4Bernie I didn't see it addressed in his plan. Maybe I just missed it
691818899428544512 2016-01-25 03:04:13 UTC <Bearnmind> O'Malley appears to be running for the VP slot #DemTownHall
691818312498552832 2016-01-25 03:01:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @KSWomen4Bernie Tricare is the healthcare plan for active/retired military. Depending on plan, no to very low deductibles ($300 a year)
691814312193703941 2016-01-25 02:45:59 UTC <Bearnmind> Chris Cuomo needs to let voters ask the questions, his questions are softball profile piece questions #DemTownHall
691813314339414016 2016-01-25 02:42:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @KSWomen4Bernie @OHWomen4Bernie @Women4Bernie @PortiaABoulger @BernieSanders How does his plan impact active duty military on Tricare?
691812019981455361 2016-01-25 02:36:53 UTC <Bearnmind> How is Tricare addressed in @BernieSanders single payer health care? A tax increase wouldn't be offset by deductible savings. #DemTownHall
691810192917413888 2016-01-25 02:29:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicoroger he didn't explain how he would get approval if there wasn't common ground which is a much more likely scenario #DemTownHall
691809011256201216 2016-01-25 02:24:56 UTC <Bearnmind> There is more to women's issues than the pro-choice issue. #DemTownHall
691808526222651394 2016-01-25 02:23:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @SergioGuadix Not even a one-tenth of one percent chance? 
691808239881719808 2016-01-25 02:21:52 UTC <Bearnmind> Did I miss his answer on how he'd get this stuff through congress when there isn't any common ground which is more likely #DemTownHall
691806621153021955 2016-01-25 02:15:26 UTC <Bearnmind> What is the tax on speculation Bernie is going to ask Wall Street to pay to fund free college? #DemTownHall
691805717175607296 2016-01-25 02:11:50 UTC <Bearnmind> Bernie isn't answering the question on why would Americans support his single payer Medicare. He just says why it's needed #DemTownHall
691805046997131267 2016-01-25 02:09:10 UTC <Bearnmind> Bernie hand movements looks like he's conducting an orchestra #DemTownHall
691803674356613121 2016-01-25 02:03:43 UTC <Bearnmind> That's quite the suit Chris Cuomo is wearing #DemTownHall
691619167196286976 2016-01-25 13:50:33 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP The media bias in this election is disappointing. Trump goes virtually unvetted by MSM, he's even dictating how the media can cover him
691438634822692864 2016-01-24 01:53:11 UTC <Bearnmind> @ddale8 @JohnJHarwood So @realDonaldTrump is lying to his supporters. If elected, he will be a yuuge failure.
691306033113858048 2016-01-24 17:06:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Tell us how. Give specifics
691305493030162437 2016-01-24 17:04:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump 66% of GOP voters want someone other than you.   Just sayin'
691304897145344000 2016-01-24 17:01:45 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @JakeSherman but everyone else in DC has to go to work. Does @HouseGOP @Senate_GOPs ever actually work. Taxpayer funded salary to do nothing
691304457787850752 2016-01-24 17:00:01 UTC <Bearnmind> Pure breeds? And he's not a racist? And the media, Fox and his supporters will give him a pass @CNN @NBCFirstReadhttps://twitter.com/crampell/status/691290010138574849
691012647035232257 2016-01-23 21:40:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly you can't take criticism. How would you function as POTUS when 1/2 the country hates you from the start?
691011812746248192 2016-01-23 21:37:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly she asked you questions in a debate and expected answers. That's not bias, that's called being a moderator
691011187362889729 2016-01-23 21:34:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @ILANA_ANGEL Gorgeous flowers
691010980453679107 2016-01-23 21:33:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @AP_Politics @AP This man is a pathological egomaniac. I still have faith that the voters won't elect him to be POTUS.
691010398565326849 2016-01-23 21:31:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP This is who you want as the leader of your party and as POTUS? You must be so proud.https://twitter.com/buzzfeedben/status/690989853866094592
691010126350827520 2016-01-23 21:30:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump you mean your litany of how great you are, incoherent phrases, no substance and no policy. I wouldn't call that a speech
691009817830363137 2016-01-23 21:29:13 UTC <Bearnmind> Who says that? So presidential. How can people not see this is an only ego thing for @realDonaldTrump.  @GOPhttps://twitter.com/buzzfeednews/status/690992070610259970
691009000008187909 2016-01-23 21:25:58 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump He's a coward just like the rest. Trump would be disastrous but they put power before country.
691007789653692416 2016-01-23 21:21:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @costareports They know he'd be disastrous for the country but @GOP care more about party than the country. They're cowards #countryfirst
690926866828562432 2016-01-23 15:59:36 UTC <Bearnmind> I hope so. @realDonaldTrump would be disastrous for the country.https://twitter.com/stuartpstevens/status/690917840015204354
690925498478764032 2016-01-23 15:54:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump - ouch. This ad is effective in showing your sudden flip flops. This is going to leave a markhttps://twitter.com/greenfield64/status/690909187455352832
690738506256257025 2016-01-22 03:31:07 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump the only person you're for is yourself. Fine in a business not for POTUS
690709486517014528 2016-01-22 01:35:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @andersoncooper Trump's co-chair is as obnoxious as he is. The irony of him calling NR writers 10yo children. Trump acts like a bratty 3yo
690704896585240576 2016-01-22 01:17:34 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @realDonaldTrump We will be a global joke if we elect an egomaniacal demagogue like Trump.
690704609170608128 2016-01-22 01:16:26 UTC <Bearnmind> @samsteinhp @realDonaldTrump He's a small, petty man. Rather than explain why he's the best, he says why someone else is worse.
690704200485969920 2016-01-22 01:14:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @ZekeJMiller people are sick of hearing about it
690703767130476548 2016-01-22 01:13:05 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew a movie? Seriously? The only person I've ever heard say @marcorubio is an expert in foreign policy is Marco Rubio.
690702292937482242 2016-01-22 01:07:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @greta @JohnJHarwood @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz Poll shows that 66% want someone other than Trump and 80% someone other than Cruz
690701878955499520 2016-01-22 01:05:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @jaketapper @ZekeJMiller If Trump looked at what all the poll shows -. More people want somebody other than him, his head would explode
690701236383907840 2016-01-22 01:03:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes @GOP imploding over which is the lesser evil. Remember when people were elected based on who would be best for the country?
690699969767030785 2016-01-22 00:58:00 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN I can't decide if you've run out of story ideas or the anchors are so vain they think viewers want to know who changed their life
690697680981467137 2016-01-22 00:48:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN reporter said they are driving around VA looking for accidents?!?  Makes them ambulance chasers. How low will they go for ratings?
690696883514298368 2016-01-22 00:45:44 UTC <Bearnmind> The @GOP trying to decide who would do less damage to the party, NOT the country but the Republican Party. GOP puts power before country
690695263858593793 2016-01-22 00:39:18 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew if Trump is elected POTUS and treated the way Obama has been by the GOP, he would spend all his time on Twitter responding.
690694450167832576 2016-01-22 00:36:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Again that means that poll shows that more people prefer someone else to you
690628083821445120 2016-01-22 20:12:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump You do understand that this means 55% don't support you. Just sayin'
690610115125329920 2016-01-22 19:00:57 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Not you guys too. This storm is news not BREAKING news. You need to stop watching @cnnbrk
690607595443339264 2016-01-22 18:50:56 UTC <Bearnmind> Idk why @CNN thinks I care about who impacted their lives. Such a vanity network.
690606128875606016 2016-01-22 18:45:06 UTC <Bearnmind> @WSJ @JohnJHarwood @ByronTau you would think using Senate resources for a POTUs run would be a conflict of interest
690605203008155648 2016-01-22 18:41:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @mckaycoppins @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP don't and have never wanted a free press.
690604405402537986 2016-01-22 18:38:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @AP The @Senate_GOPs @HouseGOP doing their best to erase the progress made in eliminating bigotry, racism and discrimination in the U.S.
690603659378429953 2016-01-22 18:35:17 UTC <Bearnmind> Oh right because all life matters to @marcorubio unless you're an immigrant. #hypocrite #inexperienced #notachancehttps://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/690590650459365376
690602649666916352 2016-01-22 18:31:17 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller @ChrisChristie the bad PR. He has to appear to be doing his job while he campaigns (unsuccessfully) for another.  #notachance
690602231712890880 2016-01-22 18:29:37 UTC <Bearnmind> @ChrisChristie @JakeSherman Does he believe bad grammar makes him seem relatable? I was considering voting Republican but this field...
690600882833088513 2016-01-22 18:24:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @senate_gops @JuddLegum @GOP @HouseGOP @Senate_GOPs And this is who you're warming to? Political power is more important than this country to the GOP
690600326697750528 2016-01-22 18:22:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @hunterschwarz @mckaycoppins @ChrisChristie I guess the bad PR got to him. Not like he's going home because he cares about his state
690598016936443904 2016-01-22 18:12:52 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP Proof that the GOP puts party above country. They know Trump would be a disaster but they cavehttps://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/690597146064732161
690597330047877120 2016-01-22 18:10:08 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump You do know it's not a statement on you but a statement in how intensely people detest @tedcruz
690596957748862978 2016-01-22 18:08:40 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump can you say specifically how?
690596406369873921 2016-01-22 18:06:28 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump Eminent domain is against conservative principles, but you're not a Republican so you already knew that #disasterous
690596114706333696 2016-01-22 18:05:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump wow are you thin-skinned. A truly confident man wouldn't feel the need to respond to every criticism #notaconservative
690595550845112320 2016-01-22 18:03:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @ CNN @cnnbrk @wolfblitzer A storm you've been talking about all week and all morning is not BREAKING news. CNN is unwatchable #cryingwolf
690520852308320257 2016-01-22 13:06:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @RosieGray @BuzzFeedBen @Reince - staring into the nothingness that has become the GOP muttering how did this happen. Reap what you sow
690519210125033472 2016-01-22 12:59:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller that play on words is painful. He must be getting desperate.
690518882197606401 2016-01-22 12:58:25 UTC <Bearnmind> @PeteDominick @realDonaldTrump He's predicable in his response to any criticism. He's so thin-skinned. His ego must be so fragile.
690517195043004416 2016-01-22 12:51:43 UTC <Bearnmind> @MSNBC Rick Snyder practicing to be Captain America using his "it's not my fault" magic shield to deflect blame for Flint. #ResignGovSnyder
690372276932472832 2016-01-21 03:15:51 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN Why are you airing another Trump rally? Your bias is showing. You've sold out any credibility you may have had for ratings
690369307885355008 2016-01-21 03:04:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @NRO your Trump issue is going to give @CNN fits. If Trump falters, their whole evening programming is gone.  CNN is all Trump all the time
690365856241598465 2016-01-21 02:50:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @JohnJHarwood @NRO @RichLowry @FoxNews @GOP and Fox have spent 7 years creating these monsters, now the country will suffer for it
690139422994595843 2016-01-21 11:50:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @nytpolitics @nbc Donald Trump has bullied the press into submission, and it really wasnt hard http://www.salon.com/2016/01/21/donald_trump_has_already_won_his_war_on_the_press_and_it_really_wasnt_hard_partner
690030861727719424 2016-01-20 04:39:12 UTC <Bearnmind> @tedcruz yeah, I can see thathttps://twitter.com/buzzfeedandrew/status/690015664619200512
690030460282486785 2016-01-20 04:37:36 UTC <Bearnmind> @greenfield64 @jpodhoretz but entertaining until you remember what's at stake. Our politics are so broken.
690027853635780609 2016-01-20 04:27:15 UTC <Bearnmind> @buffalobills I love the sound of more glass breaking - Buffalo Bills Hire NFLs First Female FT Assistant Coachhttp://www.buzzfeed.com/mbvd/first-ever-full-time-female-nfl-coach?utm_term=.lvl0X7jMM
690017671941918720 2016-01-20 03:46:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @dcbigjohn hot air being expelled by Trump meets the cold air from Canada and Armageddon results. Metaphor for a potential Trump presidency
690009762155597824 2016-01-20 03:15:21 UTC <Bearnmind> @teddyschleifer @ZekeJMiller He got busted and is making excuses.
689978547075682305 2016-01-20 01:11:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @realDonaldTrump it will just be an apocalyptic loss I guess
689978427630292994 2016-01-20 01:10:50 UTC <Bearnmind> @thehill @JohnJHarwood insanity -doing the same thing but expect a different result. How many times has Huckabee run for POTUS? Just sayin'
689957345217155072 2016-01-20 23:47:04 UTC <Bearnmind> @GOP - give more authority to the state. Yeah, that's worked out so well for MI. @onetoughnerd cares more about politics than people #resign
689956795197083648 2016-01-20 23:44:53 UTC <Bearnmind> @onetoughnerd political career is toast. He cared nothing about Flint until it became so public he couldn't ignore it #ResignGovSnyder
689956297031163905 2016-01-20 23:42:54 UTC <Bearnmind> @onetoughnerd is trying hard to keep his job. Says he needs to stay to fix the problem (that he caused). If he had any honor he would resign
689955822571540480 2016-01-20 23:41:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @CBSNews @onetoughnerd says teachers need to stop hurting children as he is responsible for irreversible harm to thousands #timetoresign
689937712439255040 2016-01-20 22:29:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @JebBush - outraged Christians are being targeted in Middle East as the GOP wants to keep out people based on religion. Hypocrites.
689812885388787713 2016-01-20 14:13:02 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire translation -I'm an idiot who likes the way these words sound together
689655140790444032 2016-01-19 03:46:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea RHOBH is the franchise I like least but I'm loving Erika. She is who she is and if you don't like she doesn't care. Refreshing
689654398318940164 2016-01-19 03:43:16 UTC <Bearnmind> @Realitytea At times LVP comes off as insensitive and indifferent. Totally different than on Rules where she is way too involved
689645563621543941 2016-01-19 03:08:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew @kyletblaine That's quite an accomplishment and worthy of praise, seriously.
689644399882534912 2016-01-19 03:03:32 UTC <Bearnmind> @politicalwire Not every sentence that Trump speaks is news. I get the need for web traffic and clicks but c'mon
689638855813795840 2016-01-19 02:41:30 UTC <Bearnmind> @passantino @PeteDominick She's unhinged
689618288276537345 2016-01-19 01:19:47 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @andersoncooper Nice diversity of political opinions from your usual panel of pundits and CNN employees
689617925154705409 2016-01-19 01:18:20 UTC <Bearnmind> @andersoncooper Why do you hate us? Replaying Palin's "speech" is cruel and inhumane.  What have we done to you? #makehergoaway
689613616228777985 2016-01-19 01:01:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN I give as many f**ks about Trump's son reaction to Palin's endorsement as I do about Bristol Palin. Aren't you a news channel?
689613112933236736 2016-01-19 00:59:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew HaHa "quiet" generosity. She can't be babbling about Trump. If he's generous he's going to announce it with a bullhorn
689612592785022976 2016-01-19 00:57:09 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller Sanity and common sense have no place at a Trump/Palin  rally
689612404272005120 2016-01-19 00:56:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller Not for the rest of us.
689612030270164992 2016-01-19 00:54:55 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix Ick
689611950205050880 2016-01-19 00:54:35 UTC <Bearnmind> @ZekeJMiller it's amazing or scary that she wrote it down.
689611804381679616 2016-01-19 00:54:01 UTC <Bearnmind> @Swerdlick @daveweigel Stuck in 08, replaying it over and over again in her head, I coulda been a contender
689611505541713920 2016-01-19 00:52:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeedAndrew too funny
689611308807933952 2016-01-19 00:52:03 UTC <Bearnmind> @chrislhayes it seemed like an eternity. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...
689611125827198977 2016-01-19 00:51:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @thefix @TheFix @NYTnickc let me translate - vote for Trump, he's not an opium addict. Evidently the GOP bar is really low this cycle
689610838836187136 2016-01-19 00:50:10 UTC <Bearnmind> @DomenicoNPR She clearly hasn't forgiven Obama for beating her. She needs new material
689609954316193792 2016-01-19 00:46:40 UTC <Bearnmind> Someone should have warned @realDonaldTrump that unleashed Palin's ego is uncontrollable and will come back to bite you #askmccain
689608631470419968 2016-01-19 00:41:24 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN What exactly are your guidelines for defining something as "breaking news"? I don't believe you anymore
689607072929939457 2016-01-19 00:35:13 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN  listening to Jeffrey Lord say Sarah Palin gave a great speech with a straight face. He's a good liar or delusional.
689606744025219072 2016-01-19 00:33:54 UTC <Bearnmind> Finally Trump has met his match in delusional, egomaniacal politics. Palin. I hope it was as painful for him as it was for us.
689605968745893888 2016-01-19 00:30:49 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeed @CNN @BuzzFeedAndrew  she's just throwing buzzwords and dog whistles together. Same old shit.
689605588570017794 2016-01-19 00:29:19 UTC <Bearnmind> @BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedAndrew So we should vote for Trump because he's not an opium addict?
689605461218304001 2016-01-19 00:28:48 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedAndrew Palin is stuck in a time warp. After listening to her, you know Trump is regretting this endorsement
689604057309257728 2016-01-19 00:23:14 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @BuzzFeedAndrew @BuzzFeed @cnn Wow, is Palin bitter about the 2008 loss or what?
689603359293194240 2016-01-19 00:20:27 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN @BuzzFeedAndrew OMG, what the hell is Palin even trying to say. God help us all, she thinks she's running again
689598890329374721 2016-01-19 00:02:42 UTC <Bearnmind> @CNN What fresh hell is this.  Palin spewing nonsense as usual. But she's in it to win it. How'd that work out for you in '08?
