918220961773531137 2017-10-11 21:05:11 UTC <bill_child> @NathanLerner What an idiot.  "...he compared the situation in the country (Afghanistan) to running a well-known Manhattan restaurant."

863158410954461184 2017-05-12 22:26:16 UTC <bill_child> @aterkel Excellent. because I don't think I should have to buy auto insurance anymore either because I'm done getting into car crashes.

862036171508948992 2017-05-09 20:06:53 UTC <bill_child> @LawyerRogelio Apparently, they are successfully kidding the 30-40% of the populace who continue to support these grifters.
856212778469556230 2017-04-23 18:26:48 UTC <bill_child> @ACScowcroft Le Pen will be in the June election, thanks in no small part to this attack. I expect Drumpf will follow suit soon w/ attack in US

835281843935031296 2017-02-24 00:14:45 UTC <bill_child> @peterdaou Exactly how I feel these days...
835262017871081473 2017-02-24 22:55:58 UTC <bill_child> @TheCatWhisprer Also their LUNGS and their ability to use them...
835259170152574976 2017-02-24 22:44:39 UTC <bill_child> @BigBeard74 I've been shouting this from the rooftops for weeks to anyone that will listen. Trump's insanity is just a shiny distraction.

834976313194602496 2017-02-23 04:00:40 UTC <bill_child> @TIME This is what they have worked for decades to accomplish. The destruction of all social progress over the past 75 years.
834953678087868416 2017-02-23 02:30:44 UTC <bill_child> @annediego Frightening. It will get worse.
834906834100105216 2017-02-23 23:24:35 UTC <bill_child> @justinjm1 Too bad repubs in congress don't give a s**t about anything other than their own hateful agenda, and won't do anything about it.
833082472422219776 2017-02-18 22:35:14 UTC <bill_child> @MMFlint This is frightening. All we need now is a terrorist attack and he's likely guaranteed a second term. Assuming we live so long.
832334852103905281 2017-02-16 21:04:27 UTC <bill_child> @NormOrnstein @cslatersr Yes. And repubs will continue until they eliminate all social progress of the past 75 years, then they will impeach
831984987767332864 2017-02-15 21:54:13 UTC <bill_child> @cmclymer Trump couldn't write 200 coherent and salient words about why he supports himself.

827688910574661636 2017-02-03 01:23:08 UTC <bill_child> @politico The biggest problem is that democrats won't spew vitriol about this like the repubs did constantly about Obama. #KnifeToAGunfight
827680549179269120 2017-02-03 00:49:55 UTC <bill_child> @brianstelter Happily, in the long run none of this matters because we'll all be dead. And by long run I mean next year, if not before.
827645237480738816 2017-02-03 22:29:36 UTC <bill_child> @domjoly Wow, his pussy-grabbing arm is strong!
827290562998841344 2017-02-02 23:00:15 UTC <bill_child> @politico @RBReich It's sad but none of our complaints matter, they are moving ahead destroying our country and we can't stop them.
826602886213677056 2017-01-31 01:27:40 UTC <bill_child> @RepMarkTakano I'm glad you agree. No hearings, no meetings, no confirmation.
826208338765418497 2017-01-30 23:19:52 UTC <bill_child> @DavidYankovich Because most of the media are cowards who are just interested in earning money, or want the power that comes with access
825872803056361472 2017-01-29 01:06:34 UTC <bill_child> @lizzieohreally No do it, now! How else can we stop the idiocy?
824724817882423296 2017-01-26 21:04:53 UTC <bill_child> @danpfeiffer Well, taxes on the poor and middle class are ok...

820698267566510080 2017-01-15 18:24:49 UTC <bill_child> @kylegriffin1 I'm sure our crack republican congress will get right on it. Defending the Constitution is a priority for them, amiright?
820074496023351297 2017-01-13 01:06:10 UTC <bill_child> @joshuakeating https://youtu.be/VEB-OoUrNuk
819228315206623232 2017-01-11 17:03:45 UTC <bill_child> Trump stands there spewing meaningless platitudes and outright lies. Why doesn't anyone in the press actually confront him on some of this?
819223530239705088 2017-01-11 16:44:44 UTC <bill_child> @AndyRichter @scottbix Why aren't any of the media people calling him out on this lie, right now, in this perfect venue for it?
818620361570852864 2017-01-09 00:47:58 UTC <bill_child> @CNNMoney All it takes is for someone to pet his tummy and he will do it. He will do whatever you want if you massage his ego the right way.
817817849947262977 2017-01-07 19:39:04 UTC <bill_child> @NicholsUprising The repubs goal is to destroy the middle class. This is just the beginning of our return to the time of serfs and lords.
817568288867655680 2017-01-06 03:07:24 UTC <bill_child> @RBReich Why is it that every one of these fb.me links is 'broken'? It's not just you, but all of them. Just curious. Perhaps its just me
817521701898448898 2017-01-06 00:02:17 UTC <bill_child> @PPact @kylegriffin1 @MABarrettWrites The people are too late. They should have spoken in November. The people are now doomed.
817088418148515840 2017-01-05 19:20:34 UTC <bill_child> @qz You are correct, but this info is readily available on the BLS website and always has been.
816030814987132928 2017-01-02 21:18:02 UTC <bill_child> @fmanjoo And they will succeed, in spite of any democratic 'resistance', and 150 years of social progress will be destroyed for generations.
814636473123123200 2016-12-29 00:57:25 UTC <bill_child> @RBReich We can hope...pic.twitter.com/HKrPwXBlDv
813821922395860992 2016-12-27 19:00:41 UTC <bill_child> @realDonaldTrump Lies, lies, and more lies, they never stop.
810957196217307136 2016-12-19 21:17:17 UTC <bill_child> @TheAtlantic It's been several hours and Drumpf hasn't tweeted anything stupid yet. Is he golfing or on the toilet somewhere with no wifi?
809258710014967809 2016-12-14 04:48:06 UTC <bill_child> @ObsoleteDogma She is an ignorant fool but the right wing still loves her. Guess that makes them ignorant as well.
808794672164323328 2016-12-13 22:04:11 UTC <bill_child> @kylegriffin1 I detect an impending blow job just not sure yet who's the blower and who's the blowee.
808059166774333440 2016-12-11 21:21:33 UTC <bill_child> @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold He's obviously wrong but he and repubs are soon in total power and there is almost nothing we can do about it.
807746393792073728 2016-12-10 00:38:42 UTC <bill_child> @TheAtlantic Too bad facts no longer matter. He will continue to gloat. His followers will continue to stroke him. Sad for the rest of us.
807411448573935616 2016-12-09 02:27:44 UTC <bill_child> @realDonaldTrump @CNNMoney Golly, 22% of those surveyed are idiots!
807380097271402496 2016-12-09 00:23:10 UTC <bill_child> @kylegriffin1 Unfortunately, it may be controversial but it will sail through congress because the republicans now own the process.
807054336429727744 2016-12-08 02:48:42 UTC <bill_child> @Eugene_Robinson Apparently shooting that person in the back is not sufficient to convict.
805937392355971072 2016-12-05 00:50:22 UTC <bill_child> @SJosephBurns So what % do you set as an acceptable loss? Or do you use indicators such as 20/50/200sma, or 52wk low, or...what?
805615644158722048 2016-12-04 03:31:51 UTC <bill_child> @GeorgeTakei More likely, our last president.
805186829108379648 2016-12-03 23:07:54 UTC <bill_child> @anneapplebaum Obviously they are motivated by commercial interest, everything Drumpf does is for greed. He now just has a new platform.
803011061230096384 2016-11-27 23:02:10 UTC <bill_child> @GeorgeTakei He is an amoral sociopath. In different circumstances he would already be in jail, or dead.
799728832257232897 2016-11-18 21:39:46 UTC <bill_child> @GeorgeTakei Hmm, yet another lie surfaces. During the campaign he repeatedly said he never settles lawsuits because he 'always wins'.
797166861221662720 2016-11-11 19:59:25 UTC <bill_child> @EByard Good luck 18-25'ers, if you are really lucky the country may survive long enough for you to actually vote again next time in 2018
796478171646291973 2016-11-09 22:22:48 UTC <bill_child> @MMFlint Unfortunately, it is now.
796472781412012032 2016-11-09 22:01:23 UTC <bill_child> @NicholsUprising Thanks! I feel so much better now...
796461520079069184 2016-11-09 21:16:38 UTC <bill_child> @EByard Where were these 18-25 folks yesterday when it actually mattered?
792097112989110272 2016-10-28 20:14:02 UTC <bill_child> @MMFlint Seriously though, what else would you have expected from P.T. Barnum-Trump?
781925571479506948 2016-09-30 18:35:58 UTC <bill_child> @realDonaldTrump Uh uh...you go first Donnie boy. Then show me some proof.
