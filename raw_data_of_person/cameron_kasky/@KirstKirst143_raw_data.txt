The singles are supposed to go out to bars and buy clothes and makeup to make they're not alone and the couples are supposed to worry that if they don't spend enough money they'll get dumped.

960368883700875264 2018-02-04 04:25:59 UTC <KirstKirst143> @EVA_SlVE Don't forget the "Girls are interested in boys way before boys even think about it" stuff. Yeah, because they're sexualized at an early age and all of their media and most of their toys tell them they're supposed to be worried about what boys think of them
960367733996109824 2018-02-04 04:21:25 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather The majority of the people at the large party I went to were in Seahawk gear... lol I don't see why it matters. They want others to know they watch football!
960367391023579137 2018-02-04 04:20:03 UTC <KirstKirst143> Unwanted opinion: I think Kylie's life/pregnancy is really sad. Commoditized, allowed to date a much older man and have unneeded plastic surgery as minor, uneducated, and a baby before she's even old enough to legally drink. She's not someone to emulate. Oh but she makes makeup
960080780465553409 2018-02-04 09:21:10 UTC <KirstKirst143> Boys let me tell you a little secret.  #WhatWomenWant is simply to feel like you're listening and trying. Few expect perfection just want to see some effort!
959889341236441088 2018-02-03 20:40:27 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Oh it's so good! Chicken breast in a mozzarella and provolone cheese sauce with bacon and cooked onion stuffed into a bread roll thing and toasted. Mmmm... now I'm hungry!pic.twitter.com/SeQWjKkl1b
959866806130233345 2018-02-03 19:10:54 UTC <KirstKirst143> Why is it that people only call when you want to be left alone?
959866609140576256 2018-02-03 19:10:07 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey I don't think I've ever eaten there tbh. I've only been there a few times and not in a long time.  Costco is kinda famous for their all beef, kosher hot dogs  They are good but personally I really like this stuffed bread thing they have called a chicken bake

959634665098248192 2018-02-02 03:48:27 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Costco has a bit of a cult following. It almost can't be described. Very high quality stuff for cheap except you have to buy a ton of it which makes it less cheap. Plus strangely delicious food! Having a membership is initiation to suburban adulthood

959594164034809861 2018-02-02 01:07:31 UTC <KirstKirst143> Buzzfeeds gotta be so sick of all their people leaving, then the replacement people leave as soon as they get famous on the platform as well.

959444402904088577 2018-02-02 15:12:25 UTC <KirstKirst143> Why is it that young parents are allowed to criticize people &share that stupid meme about "you'll be doing the carpool at 48" but if you answered "statistically I'll be carpooling back to my house and you'll be kicking it up in the apartment you rent" you'd be in trouble?
959439209177145344 2018-02-02 14:51:47 UTC <KirstKirst143> It's a lesson in having a good doctor that will weigh your risk factors carefully and actually thoroughly reading the info provided and potential side effects yourself. But it not working for you doesn't mean it's bad for everyone!
959439202491355136 2018-02-02 14:51:46 UTC <KirstKirst143> Even if a medication doesnt work or has really bad side effects for even 3/10 people that doesn't mean it's a bad medicine that shouldn't be available! What about the 7 other people who benefited? When you multiply that into 1000s of people there's gonna be both kinds of patients

Used as a simple way to fund cops & harass people, & to punish outside of the judicial system
959077188975738880 2018-02-01 14:53:15 UTC <KirstKirst143> @cnnbrk @CBSNews @thehill @ACLU @GreenPartyHello If you can't prove why you have your own money you can't get it back! Even then you may have trouble. My fave story is of man (& POC) driving thru Texas to buy a car having several thousand dollars confiscated after being pulled over. Only got it back due to media attention!
959072280516046849 2018-02-01 14:33:45 UTC <KirstKirst143> We do not talk about civil forfeiture laws enough Cops can LEGALLY confiscate your money w/o you being charged w/anything. It's extremely difficult to get back & the police pocket it 100s of thousands of dollars are stolen every year #ThursdayThoughts #BLM #WhoAreTheRealCriminals

957743508021854208 2018-01-28 22:33:40 UTC <KirstKirst143> When I talk about politics on Facebook it causes arguments & drama. At least on Twitter that doesn't happen. But that's because no one's reading it

957295663930269697 2018-01-27 16:54:06 UTC <KirstKirst143> It's true what they say about how everyone's dealing with shit you don't know about. So why not just try to be nice? Even if you dislike someone, you can keep not liking them without being mean, rude, or hateful. People got real problems especially now that we're adults
957295179672649729 2018-01-27 16:52:11 UTC <KirstKirst143> So they're building this giant ass house on my grandma's property and I HATE it. It's irrational but they knocked the house down, pulled out all her rose & rhodie bushes, & didn't use the OG foundation that my gpa dug by hand. I drive by & it hurts to look at. She'd have hated it
957293609786646529 2018-01-27 16:45:56 UTC <KirstKirst143> @lil_sheep_ Yeah that guys giving bad advice. Quitting benzos cold turkey is really dangerous. That's one of the few things they'll give you drugs for withdrawal when you go to jail cause you can easily die. Super addictive & dangerous to quit. Sorry about your friend

956628072928702464 2018-01-25 20:41:20 UTC <KirstKirst143> Im sorry but this is NOT okay. Judges are supposed to be impartial. You represent the justice system not you're own feelings about the defendant. She did all this good in the long sentence and allowing victims to speak but this level of animosity is not okhttp://huffp.st/rCdtyAd
956579301255770116 2018-01-25 17:27:32 UTC <KirstKirst143> Millennials go on these life changing trips to Asia. Cool, awesome. I'm jealous! You know what's not cool? The selfies with tigers & of riding elephants. How exactly do you think works for a tiger to be willing to let dozens of people take photos with it?
956454859456241664 2018-01-25 09:13:03 UTC <KirstKirst143> HIMYM is problematic way too often, sometimes much worse than others. Yet somehow I can look past it. Usually I can't overlook stuff like that. Some shit in it REALLY pisses me off like Marshall calling Robin a slut but I still watch. Yet I can't watch the final season at all! 
956410460118573058 2018-01-24 06:16:37 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Seriously! The girl from that gif looks strangely familiar...  I wonder who it is
956410228131557376 2018-01-24 06:15:42 UTC <KirstKirst143> Finding out that Toto is singing "I BLESS the rains down in Africa" changed my life. And anyone who claims they always knew that that's what it was is lying! #MisheardLyrics
956409081014571008 2018-01-24 06:11:08 UTC <KirstKirst143> My favorite #MisheardLyrics is my best friend thinking that Mariah Carey was singing "I gotta chicken roll" instead of Shake and Roll. Sounds crazy until you listen to the song and it DOES sound a lot like chicken roll
956408625873891328 2018-01-24 06:09:20 UTC <KirstKirst143> I know I already said this but I really really really regret updating my YouTube app. It's terrible! It doesn't rotate with the screen anymore! When you press full screen it'll only go one way which of course is the opposite of how I usually hold my phone. Fix this #YouTube

956366509999144960 2018-01-24 03:21:59 UTC <KirstKirst143> @AuthorLBrown @JoshOdyssey Yeah she's the white one's mom and is waaay bigger! She's a huge and heavy cat. Nora, the little one is even smaller than she looks cause she's fluffy. You pick her up & surprised by how light she is. No idea who her dad is but its surprising cause her mom's huge
956184226721808384 2018-01-24 15:17:39 UTC <KirstKirst143> You ever talk to or read something from someone you grew up with and realize you have pretty much zero in common? Was Facebook stalking someone from middle school and they're a freaking MRA. And also seem to have a thing for making up statistics pic.twitter.com/smrdkdx9Vh
955849403981488128 2018-01-23 17:07:11 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Invasive species suck. The US has a really bad problem w/ that all over but especially in Florida. The Everglades are a really unique ecosystem but warm enough to support all kinds of foreign tropical animals Department of wildlife actually pays people to go kill invasive snakes!
955835297664679937 2018-01-23 16:11:08 UTC <KirstKirst143> #TuesdayThoughts It's so weird that the wild bunnies we have in the US and domesticated pet bunnies aren't genetically similar enough to mate. Like a wolf & a dog or lion & a tiger can but not two types of bunnies. This is the shit I think about at night
955834674370174976 2018-01-23 16:08:39 UTC <KirstKirst143> Why is it my dog only wants to play when I'm trying to sleep?? Last night he was FREAKING OUT digging at foot of the bed. I had to get up turn on the lights & didn't even see a toy Turned out his mini tennis ball was under some stuff. Idk how he even knew it was there! He's BLIND
955833909106827264 2018-01-23 16:05:37 UTC <KirstKirst143> All I'm saying is that if the #Earthquake in #Alaska had actually caused a #Tsunami I would've DIED because I slept right through the #TsunamiWarning.  I mean who's checking their phone or the news at 3am or 4am? Not the majority of us! That only happens when my insomnia is bad

The only 1 who sees it is their victims

955567033713811456 2018-01-22 22:25:09 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather Remember when your parents would get you new school clothes so you'd carefully plan out your 1st day of school outfit? Or the 1st week's if you were organized  Then on the 1st day you'd be terrified but at least you were feeling fly! And hope no one was wearing the same thing
955565217148096512 2018-01-22 22:17:55 UTC <KirstKirst143> Megyn Kelly said that during the Vietnam war Jane Fonda called torture of POWs "understandable." Is that true?? Seriously?

955546601589637121 2018-01-22 21:03:57 UTC <KirstKirst143> @RUNLikeJosh Well I'd imagine I'd have to maneuver for that as well. You know cats. Movement is NOT tolerated! Sometimes I go through all kinds of effort to get out of bed without disturbing her and she STILL slinks off. Bitch

955478689050800128 2018-01-22 16:34:06 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Oh for sure there's a spectrum of all types of mental illnesses/issues I've always felt with addiction issues that your problem doesn't have to or necessarily will be the same as someone else's idea of when it's an issue You can drink 1 day a week & maybe thats a real issue 4 you
955351461692506112 2018-01-22 08:08:32 UTC <KirstKirst143> @manslaper That's my problem with it! Can't expect Chris Rock or Amy Schumer money when you're a minor comedian
955350606490693635 2018-01-22 08:05:08 UTC <KirstKirst143> @manslaper Lol. I was just shocked it's getting enough attention to be an article posted on my local newstation's Facebook page! Really?? Who knew she had that many Instagram followers when she's not really very famous?
955349951948533760 2018-01-22 08:02:32 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Lots of ppl replied to mine saying they had hard time making friends too like "oh I must be depressed lol" but that's just one small aspect of extremely low energy & motivation issues for me. I left out the ignoring calls, not eating or oversnacking, not wanting to shower, etc
955349224132042752 2018-01-21 07:59:39 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey I think there's a ton of stuff that are aspects of depression that are common experiences for non depressed people too. Some shit is a bit universal. Just those thing are felt more strongly or in conjunction with other stuff for clinically or even moderately depressed people
955348161702199296 2018-01-21 07:55:25 UTC <KirstKirst143> Btw he's the thin, kinda tall, black male nurse that's frequently in episodes, assisting and maybe supplying a line or two. You'd definitely recognize him if you saw him. Played by Moe Irvin
955347400494800897 2018-01-21 07:52:24 UTC <KirstKirst143> Have never heard of Mo'nique but she wants us to boycott Netflix because she got a "lowball" offer of $500k compared to household names like Chris Rock & Amy Schumer. Do you think Nurse Tyler (who amiright?) of Grey's Anatomy is making a fraction of Ellen Pompeo's $20mil?
955329491890393088 2018-01-21 06:41:14 UTC <KirstKirst143> EVERY film romance EVER: character(s) do terrible, unreasonable, unfair, stalkerish, crazy things but it's all okay because they're *meant for each other*  "You're crazy..."

955253869012926464 2018-01-21 01:40:44 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Real commercials or like SNL style fake ones?
955243582956306432 2018-01-21 00:59:52 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Yeah I've got unlimited data and a very large DVD collection plus a few hard drives that we have lots of shows and movies on.

954980339373424640 2018-01-20 07:33:50 UTC <KirstKirst143> HUGE s1 #HIMYM plot hole: Victoria's expected to move across the world in less than a week. No time to get visa, break lease, pack store or ship belongings, & SHE OWNS HER OWN BUSINESS ALREADY Isn't that the goal? Those businesses are built on reputation & have 2 would start over
954978886525190144 2018-01-20 07:28:03 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Oh yeah there's a lot of stuff going on. Definitely a show you have to watch alone/with someone quiet, when you're wide awake at least the first time around. Once you figure out who's who it's so good! Especially the first season but they're all good

954936582389116929 2018-01-20 04:39:57 UTC <KirstKirst143> Due to being an uncommon, high level sport & young age of athletes, things are tolerated/normal that are just not found in other children's sports. Extreme dieting/weight expectations, living away from family, isolation, verbal abuse, etc all in the name of being a winner.
954936450545430533 2018-01-20 04:39:26 UTC <KirstKirst143> That culture of isolation, idea that  abusive tactics are normal within culture & only gymnasts understand the level of work, requirements, training methods, & pressure allowed #LarryNassar to flourish. "It's all part of being the best & you know others just don't get it!"
954930034355011584 2018-01-20 04:13:56 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey I'm doubtful I'd be a big fan of the Book of Mormon since I'm not into the actual one  I don't like most musicals either although there's a handful of movies like Grease that I have some nostalgia for
954911732517945344 2018-01-20 03:01:13 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey I really should check it out! I've never heard one bad thing about it! Do you live in London? Are you going to see the play?

954812709085765632 2018-01-20 20:27:44 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey What was his actual name?
954812607382212608 2018-01-20 20:27:19 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Haha! Hamilton's a girl but initially we thought she was a boy and the name stuck. Often end up correcting people but that's not surprising given her name
954812288791298048 2018-01-20 20:26:03 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Yes we have family dinner there on Sundays & I stop by at least 1 other day a week. I moved her w/me to college but when I moved back I had roomates w/pets.  When I got my own space I realized she's happier there. 2 stressful + she hates my dog!  I'm still her favorite though!

954806971340767232 2018-01-20 20:04:56 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey Oh I bet she/he was beautiful! I'm not sure how Siamese Lily is but she's got the beautiful, bright blue eyes.  Hamilton unfortunately lives with my parents as she's 13 now and was really stressed when I tried to move her out of their house  I just have to visit frequently lol

954520988284104709 2018-01-19 01:08:32 UTC <KirstKirst143> But if you name your kid Chicago West you cant call it Chi as in "Shy!" It only makes sense as "Che!" & no "Chai" doesn't work unless you pronounce Chicago weird You want "Shy" then you shoulda named her Cheyenne as thats also a geographical location which is important apparentlypic.twitter.com/NJjCBYDHdC

I get enough of this from Facebook & following the news. Your 280 word opinion isn't making up my mind especially when I already agree most of the time!  Post more memes please! 
954396988585385984 2018-01-19 16:55:48 UTC <KirstKirst143> @JoshOdyssey I reread that and it sounds like I'm saying that I had a thing for Spike too as in you do but I mean that in addition to the other things I liked about Buffy. The phrasing could be open to interpretation

954011130795515904 2018-01-18 15:22:32 UTC <KirstKirst143> @femestella I was rereading the responses & yours strikes me as 1 of the closet to my experience. Getting showered & ready, driving into town, often having to spend $$ to go to loud, crowded public place, is just too much most days but at the same time lonely by yourself at home all the time

A few pills a month, not enough to "get high" but to take the edge off on bad days. Docs still think of it as "period pain/cramps."

952991977619902464 2018-01-15 19:52:47 UTC <KirstKirst143> We hold MLK up as an unattainable example of what today's activists *should* be, ignoring that most use his same non violent tactics & that he was disliked by majority of US. NO DOUBT that he'd be part of BLM. Celebrate him by supporting #DACA #BlackLivesMatter & #equalpay !

952974183478132736 2018-01-15 18:42:05 UTC <KirstKirst143> All 3 of my BFFs have moved out of state in the last 5 years and I haven't been able to or done enough to makes new friends to fill that absence. After high school ends you find out who truly cares & who hung out because you were around everyday.

951851249925632001 2018-01-12 16:19:57 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather My question is what do they tell patients who dont want to or cant get pregnant? My fertility is compromised from endo & am high risk 4 another ectopic If youre trying to have kids then great but why mention that unless you said you were trying Would surgery compromise fertility?
951850210765955073 2018-01-12 16:15:49 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather Wow. So frustrating! I just shared a thread this morning from a nurse talking about a patient's pain. You should definitely read it! The comments are more evidence that the system treats POC, women, & LGBT as if lying/exaggerating which is well documented. It's eye opening
951849455803711490 2018-01-12 16:12:49 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather What..? Get pregnant! That's the answer! AMAZING! And what about afterwards..? Yeah fuck that. They say to get multiple opinions before any kind of major health treatment so might as well shop around. It's so much easier to feel safe w/a doctor you feel confident about and trust
951845030431354881 2018-01-12 15:55:14 UTC <KirstKirst143> Do you ever have social anxiety about social media? Cause I definitely do! I worry about things being misinterpreted. It's hard to talk to strangers but at least there's the context of tone  #anxietyproblems #AnxiousForNothing
951844488200073216 2018-01-12 15:53:05 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather Oops. Reread your tweet and realized you didnt say anything about being nervous about it but somehow in my mind I could've sworn that you did. Lol I hope it didn't seem like Im not confident it will help cuz I am! Less lesions is less lesions period I might be overthinking this
951843008650997760 2018-01-12 15:47:12 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather I truly hope that the laparoscopic surgery will make a big difference for you. Although it doesn't work for everyone, it DOES make a big difference for tons of us. It's okay to be hopeful and I hope that you are!
951842474195996673 2018-01-12 15:45:04 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather Which is crazy and shows how terrible this condition is/how inept care often is. I literally lost my fallopian tube & am lucky because my abdomen filled with lesions so I get to be believed. Ppl talk about fighting for years for answers & care, not believed, not helped
951841355327680512 2018-01-12 15:40:38 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather I'm so sorry. Truly.  I hear stories from other women with endometriosis & count myself as lucky. I went on BC at 16, had uncomfortable periods but not debilitating, the depo shot works really well for me, and mostly its that I didn't have to fight for years for a diagnosis. 1/2
951837501840224257 2018-01-12 15:25:19 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather I have bad insomnia too. Been up since 3am. Ugh. I'm 25 years old and already feels like my body is dysfunctional af! Not being able to sleep is the worst ESPECIALLY when you're in pain cause sleep is all you want to try to get through it 
951836759473598465 2018-01-12 15:22:22 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather Haha okay. I have endometriosis myself but wasn't sure if the term was widespread enough to not mean something else to others I'm sorry! I struggle with near constant nausea as well as endometriosis. Can never tell if stomach pain means I'm gonna puke later or *just* cramping 
951809861125156865 2018-01-12 13:35:29 UTC <KirstKirst143> @elisaheather I feel like this might be a dumb question but by endo does she mean endometriosis? Cause that's what it means to me but I'm also old and constantly learning new words on Twitter

Wrote my story & deleted it because specifics don't matter All it takes to suffer is 1person w/power not believing. Thanks for writing Marys story
951798191090843654 2018-01-12 12:49:06 UTC <KirstKirst143> @grimalkinrn Ugh. Even IF you think this person *might* be drug seeking, when they're already admitted to the hospital & will be for awhile, wouldn't it be better to try a one time dose of something else than potentially let them suffer?!

In average parts of the city (not downtown) would be around $1300-$1500ish. Which is still a lot for 1 person but paying 4 location. Rents been going up & up.

949268183873077249 2018-01-05 13:15:46 UTC <KirstKirst143> This would have been a much better story had I had more space!  It was just the dumbest thing I've ever seen an animal do. He knew to put his paw in but not what came next. Then left milk prints everywhere! Which in retrospect I should've cleaned up but I was enthralled by it!
949267357456769026 2018-01-05 13:12:29 UTC <KirstKirst143> Had a humongous & slow af cat, Boots. Like this fluffy boy drooled when happy Trying to get some out of my empty milk glass he put his paw in& soaked it all up. Rather than licking it he did it again w/other paw, gave up, left prints everywhere. I watched #WeirdestChildhoodMemory

949254713341456384 2018-01-05 12:22:14 UTC <KirstKirst143> Oh definitely all the times twin Barbies were kidnapped and forced into marriage by bad twin Kens and then rescued by the good twin Kens who'd marry them instead. This is why you shouldn't let kids watch adult tv  #WeirdestChildhoodMemory

Much easier to rationalize that "joking" racism isn't actually harmful Its an insidious way to spread hate that affects entire groups of people every day. One was insensitive &crass the other is hateful
948911224586084352 2018-01-04 13:37:20 UTC <KirstKirst143> Read arguments on Reddit that Logan Paul is *obviously* worse than Pewdiepie. Really?

746191242761895936 2016-06-23 04:00:30 UTC <KirstKirst143> @markfinelli when did conservatives start caring about science?
746178511409283072 2016-06-23 03:09:55 UTC <KirstKirst143> @joseiswriting worth noting that those people/countries are still (rightfully) upset about it & what it did to their culture as west is now
746148653111222272 2016-06-23 01:11:16 UTC <KirstKirst143> Who knew all it would take is deep throating a popsicle to make Keri Hilson relevant again?

746095660009545729 2016-06-23 21:40:41 UTC <KirstKirst143> Did anybody tell #BeckyWithTheBadGrades that most people just go to their 2nd or 3rd choice if they suck too much to get accepted to #1?
746094899754237952 2016-06-23 21:37:40 UTC <KirstKirst143> Is anyone even surprised? States regularly make the burden of proof & proof of intent harder to establish 4 cops. Sick of it #FreddieGray
