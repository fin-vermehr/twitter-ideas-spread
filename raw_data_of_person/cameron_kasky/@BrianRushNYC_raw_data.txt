893531006199902208 2017-08-04 17:56:07 UTC <BrianRushNYC> Former president of #Mexico #VincenteFox used the f-word on live TV. Ugh, I can't imagine having a president who is so crude!
891064441390981120 2017-07-28 22:34:52 UTC <BrianRushNYC> Researchers shut down #artificialintelligence that invented its own language. They realized it had to go once it tweeted the word #covfefe.
890663770418159616 2017-07-27 20:02:45 UTC <BrianRushNYC> #Trump donated $100K to the Education Department but cut $9.2 billion from their budget. Presumably math classes will be the first to go.

880031769470398464 2017-06-28 11:54:58 UTC <BrianRushNYC> #Trump complimented a reporter on her "nice smile." And #Melania praised her ability to refrain from scowling as soon as he turned his back.

870015071430168576 2017-05-31 20:32:11 UTC <BrianRushNYC> I don't blame #Trump for "covfefe" - he can't possibly proofread with all that smog in his eyes. #ParisAgreement #covfefe

864253568035033088 2017-05-15 22:58:02 UTC <BrianRushNYC> A 101-year-old man is now the oldest person to skydive. He didn't want to jump but #United needed more room for high priority passengers.
862263907792105472 2017-05-10 11:11:50 UTC <BrianRushNYC> The director of the #CensusBureau resigned. Apparently he got overwhelmed when they wanted him to keep count of everyone fired by #Trump.
861960158355890177 2017-05-09 15:04:50 UTC <BrianRushNYC> That's right, a study found that those who read books are nicer. While those who read online comments sections are perpetually enraged.

838046542720294912 2017-03-04 15:20:40 UTC <BrianRushNYC> I highly doubt #Obama really had #Trump's phone tapped. No way he'd listen to that idiot talk if he could avoid it.
837450784744800256 2017-03-02 23:53:20 UTC <BrianRushNYC> No wonder Trump likes his steaks burned and covered in ketchup - the GOP is being educated at Sizzler University. #MarkChelgren
836241706257383424 2017-02-27 15:48:54 UTC <BrianRushNYC> How is it possible that the #SuicideSquad Oscar announcement wasn't the mistake? #Oscars2017

829072378722402305 2017-02-07 21:00:33 UTC <BrianRushNYC> If it bothers you that #Trump speaks at a 6th grade level, have no fear! #BetsyDevos will ensure future presidents aren't that hoity-toity.
827145199604350976 2017-02-02 13:22:37 UTC <BrianRushNYC> Hey Phil Connors, why not give Ned Ryerson a break and punch #RichardSpencer in the face today instead? #GroundhogDay #PunchANazi
826235861004120065 2017-01-30 01:09:14 UTC <BrianRushNYC> I'm sitting in a great restaurant in NYC listening to the manager talk about how #Trump once ate here. Aaaaand refused to pay.
825330684571049984 2017-01-28 13:12:23 UTC <BrianRushNYC> Reporters were locked out of the #WhiteHouse due to confusion over their birth dates. #Trump prefers journalists who were born yesterday.

764142857687035904 2016-08-12 16:53:49 UTC <BrianRushNYC> For #WorldElephantDay, #Trump will have one in the room while his supporters neglect to address the fact hes an unqualified maniac.
763558457182134272 2016-08-10 02:11:37 UTC <BrianRushNYC> Maybe that guy with the suction cups on Trump Tower was trying to do that weird Michael Phelps thing and draw out Trump's toxins and stuff.
763527450496294913 2016-08-10 00:08:24 UTC <BrianRushNYC> A guy scaled #TrumpTower with suction cups earlier today. Exclaimed #Trump, "I just hope Mexicans can't climb walls like that!"
760526329401995264 2016-08-02 17:23:01 UTC <BrianRushNYC> #Trump says the #NYTimes doesn't "write good." Maybe they should plagiarize Michelle Obama.
759078692630982656 2016-07-29 17:30:37 UTC <BrianRushNYC> #Obama has clarified that he sometimes has more than 7 almonds in the evening. And, because of #Trump, at least that many glasses of wine.
755425723360354305 2016-07-19 15:35:02 UTC <BrianRushNYC> Ironically, I hear #MichelleObama responded with "I have the best words." #MelaniaTrump #DonaldTrump #FamousMelaniaTrumpQuotes
755357397527457792 2016-07-19 11:03:32 UTC <BrianRushNYC> At least #MelaniaTrump only plagiarized #MichelleObama once. Her husband has been taking ideas from Hitler for the last year. #Trump
