969325852944142336 2018-03-01 21:37:47 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump @Variety @michelrathings Then there should be no reason as to why you should worry if your kid is safe. You are the parent buying the game for him in the first place. If you buy a violent game for him and he can't handle it well...there you have it. You can prevent it. No one else.
969324213638189056 2018-03-01 21:31:16 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump @Variety @michelrathings That's why you check the back of the box for the game's ratings. M for Mature 17+ (blood, gore, tobacco use, sexual content, etc) , couldn't be more obvious. Not to mention the cover art is a dead give away if your child should play. Laziness if I ever saw it.

969183428355723266 2018-03-01 12:11:50 UTC <KarmaWolf> What a fucking moron. It's already bad enough that you had the audacity to do that to someone's beloved pet, but to also admit it as if it were akin to taking the last cookie from the cookie jar.

840149579303669760 2017-03-10 10:37:23 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump That's like saying you have a great relationship with a dull knife.
840149424458350592 2017-03-10 10:36:46 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You believe every little thing that Fox says?
840149325313392640 2017-03-10 10:36:23 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump We'll see. It might be good for your rich friends.
838897049256996864 2017-03-06 23:40:17 UTC <KarmaWolf> @parsonfilms I still can't believe you do the voices that you are credited for! You do such a great job voicing them especially Junkrat! <3

838026002471215104 2017-03-04 13:59:03 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Sure it wasn't Putin?
836706555613560836 2017-02-28 22:36:02 UTC <KarmaWolf> @PlayOverwatch Any chance that we'll get something similar for quick play? For example: Filtering out the stages we don't want to play on?
836629947854819329 2017-02-28 17:31:38 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump So what about that golden shower?
836342634633441280 2017-02-27 22:29:57 UTC <KarmaWolf> @PlayOverwatch I love how Lucio-Oh's is on the list. :P
835831014131920897 2017-02-26 12:36:57 UTC <KarmaWolf> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump You do realize that you talking shit is only making their sales go up even more? :)
835576062755078145 2017-02-25 19:43:52 UTC <KarmaWolf> @PlayOverwatch Will we soon be seeing shorts with other characters like the junkrat, roadhog, Mercy, 76 and Mei? Would love to see them soon
835548815402885122 2017-02-25 17:55:35 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Is that what you tell yourself?
834383947706617856 2017-02-22 12:46:49 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Aww, someone upset?
833332769761660930 2017-02-19 15:09:49 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Heard you told another batch of lies. :)
833116297147871232 2017-02-18 00:49:38 UTC <KarmaWolf> @westofhouse Quick question... Is there any chance that Junkrat learned the line "Gong xi fa cai" to impress Mei? :p
832949899180310528 2017-02-18 13:48:26 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump The crowd as in the protesters reminding you that no one favors you as a leader.
832949785204289537 2017-02-18 13:47:58 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump The "mess" is you and your administration. The only way it'll be fixed is if you do your job as intended or if you leave.
832593557408071680 2017-02-17 14:12:27 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Why are you still up in arms about the election results? Why don't you focus on the real issues ... such as yourself.
832047218068750336 2017-02-15 02:01:30 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Rich coming from a guy who carelessly handles important top secret documents with civilians nearby.
831686122933800968 2017-02-14 02:06:38 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Talking about Obamacare won't distract us from the Flynn issue. Nice try though.
831523058389221376 2017-02-14 15:18:40 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump It's because no one likes you.
831442285267189763 2017-02-14 09:57:42 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump It'd be nice if you showed respect to Veterans, but you love to mock them on tv.
830932515707813889 2017-02-12 00:12:04 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You mean the crowds of protesters and reporters?
830828253464166404 2017-02-12 17:17:46 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump If you were smart as a president then you wouldn't be running your mouth like you do.
830758874965745664 2017-02-12 12:42:05 UTC <KarmaWolf> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Sanders was making fun of you and it WAS technical difficulties.
830758688365375489 2017-02-12 12:41:20 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Well no shit. Their countries are in a state of turmoil.
830758513530044417 2017-02-12 12:40:39 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Yeah right. More like innocent immigrants.
830440776316354563 2017-02-11 15:38:04 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Is another awkward handshake on it's way?
830440653045825536 2017-02-11 15:37:35 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Way down my ass. Us Americans are paying for that POS and it'll be in the billions.
829844689721368578 2017-02-09 00:09:26 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Hahaha hahaha, keep crying. I knew you'd be pissed. Now you may know how the American ppl felt when you placed the ban.

829688887685570562 2017-02-09 13:50:20 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You're one to talk considering you never once fought in the military. I'd like to see how long you'd last in war.
829688640460685316 2017-02-09 13:49:21 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You're as fake and phony as a person can get.
829452139000913926 2017-02-08 22:09:35 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump I wouldn't trust you or your people to give me information on the weather.
829391516074463235 2017-02-08 18:08:41 UTC <KarmaWolf> @Nordstrom @realDonaldTrump Should be worried about running the country, not your daughter's business.
829390430706028558 2017-02-08 18:04:22 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Yeah sure.

829015678430625793 2017-02-07 17:15:14 UTC <KarmaWolf> @NationalSheriff @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Is that your way of trying to get us to forget about your relationship with Putin?
829014206808743938 2017-02-07 17:09:23 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You DO know Putin. You've said it on video yourself. Loads of times. And that was before the election. We aren't dumb.
828908372661567488 2017-02-07 10:08:51 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump The threat of ANY terrorism is very real. Get over yourself.
828908206197989376 2017-02-07 10:08:11 UTC <KarmaWolf> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Will you stop bitching about the election? You lost the popular vote. Face it. Not a whole lot of people like you.

828633130068226050 2017-02-06 15:55:08 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You finally admitted that you only find it "fake" if it's negative. You need accept that it's not fake and ppl hate you.
828369294278922243 2017-02-05 22:26:44 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump No, we blame you. Stop laying the blame on someone else and man up.
828369122488619009 2017-02-05 22:26:03 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You should be more specific. You are having them check anyone who identifies as a Muslim. Your damage control is weak.
828230050562584576 2017-02-05 13:13:26 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Let it go already. The judge put a halt on YOUR bad decision. Stop crying and start leading already.
828229803593564160 2017-02-05 13:12:27 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Not as terrible as you not putting countries who HAVE actually attacked us on the ban list.
828229626715656193 2017-02-05 13:11:45 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump The judge is doing what you as a President will never do.
827956080202416129 2017-02-04 19:04:46 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Stop having a fit and enjoy your vacation. 2 weeks down and still 4 years to go. Better get use to this.
827955873796521987 2017-02-04 19:03:57 UTC <KarmaWolf> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump It's only because it's a negative story. If they were riding your dick then you wouldn't be saying that.
827955676550938625 2017-02-04 19:03:10 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Yeah we will once you leave the white house. Permantely.
827844160287887361 2017-02-04 11:40:03 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You expect us to believe what you say? I bet you're only saying that because the taxes for Mexican imports are going up.
827667077691473920 2017-02-03 23:56:23 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Starting with you and your oh so rich friends that you are helping.
827543817431707649 2017-02-03 15:46:35 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You should be doing your job in helping to protect the country and our allies instead of tweeting.
827543214261489666 2017-02-03 15:44:11 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Fake news?You mean the people who are reporting the negative things about you? Poor little snowflake.
827543045461639168 2017-02-03 15:43:31 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump If we get into a war it'll be because of your big mouth  Learn to shut it once in a while.
827542827710218241 2017-02-03 15:42:39 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You should worry about doing your job as President effectively rather than worry about Arnold and TV ratings .
827229008223989761 2017-02-02 18:55:39 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You keep talking shit like this and one day it's really going to bite you in the ass.
827108990815522817 2017-02-02 10:58:45 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump I'm guessing Bannon told you this?
827108702700367872 2017-02-02 10:57:36 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Says the guy who is blocking refugees based on where they are from and their religious background.

826102503267823621 2017-01-30 16:19:19 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump That was jobs. What you are doing is Hitler style crap. Senators won't start WW3... YOU will.
825811497645391872 2017-01-29 21:02:58 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Did you hear that from Fox News?
825811416531759105 2017-01-29 21:02:39 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump I agree with that, but what about people from other religions who are being killed out in the middle east? You don't care.
825702530004955136 2017-01-29 13:49:58 UTC <KarmaWolf> @POTUS @KellyannePolls Waste of a soul. The both of you.
825300210289082368 2017-01-28 11:11:18 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The wall is only going to hinder them for a bit. Where there is a will to get into the country there is a way.
825299919464443904 2017-01-28 11:10:08 UTC <KarmaWolf> @POTUS No, more like greatest failure and most hated. You're on a roll so far.

824080454747885570 2017-01-24 02:24:25 UTC <KarmaWolf> @CNN @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Stop focusing on the ratings and do your god damn job. Sadly, you are a leader of a country. Act like it.
823984106597978112 2017-01-24 20:01:34 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Stay being obsessed with that inauguration.
823217015288659968 2017-01-22 17:13:25 UTC <KarmaWolf> @POTUS Looking like you don't want to be there. SMH.
823216279213473794 2017-01-22 17:10:30 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Translated to Trump speak: Fuck these people they don't know a good guy when they see one.
823216144672784386 2017-01-22 17:09:58 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Awkward as all hell from what I've seen and heard.
823215698268844032 2017-01-22 17:08:11 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, and your approval ratings are low as shit.
822800684601012226 2017-01-21 13:39:04 UTC <KarmaWolf> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump So what were the numbers for the inauguration attendance compared to Obama's? :)
822514222491955200 2017-01-20 18:40:46 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump You love talking out of your ass.

821318482201640961 2017-01-17 11:29:20 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump Then I imagine you should be ripping Ivanka's head off for daring to allow @CNN to do it. She knows you hate them.
821018149839663107 2017-01-16 15:35:55 UTC <KarmaWolf> @realDonaldTrump It would be nice if your extremists and yourself would actually do that.
820811438981808134 2017-01-15 01:54:31 UTC <KarmaWolf> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump You make it so easy for SNL to make fun of you. Keep crying and whining. They love the fodder.
