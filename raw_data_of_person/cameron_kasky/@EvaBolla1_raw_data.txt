Botswana made sport hunting illegal in 2014, has 1/3 of Africa`s elephants, expected $210m from int. tourism in 2017, while African trophy hunting is app. $200m a year.

955802373745729536 2018-01-23 14:00:18 UTC <EvaBolla1> @GDouglasJones Please, don`t think by being a wishy-washy, lukewarm politician you will attract republican voters. They will never vote for you. Nor will the progressives, the poor and the disillusioned if you disappoint them. However long it may last, aim to be a legend!

You are welcome to march, too if you need to.
