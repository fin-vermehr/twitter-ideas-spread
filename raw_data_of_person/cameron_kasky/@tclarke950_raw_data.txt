965702921257144320 2018-02-19 21:41:32 UTC <tclarke950> @AriFleischer You obviously are not on Facebook, sir. Because the trolls were everywhere and our fellow Americans were sharing the bogus stories in record numbers. So a little went a very long way.

910553569388097538 2017-09-20 17:17:42 UTC <tclarke950> @JoeNBC Hate speech and free speech are two different things. Hate speech is not a right. Free speech is.
909879938752417794 2017-09-18 20:40:56 UTC <tclarke950> @nanglish @GuyEndoreKaiser @rebkettlebells This liberal isn't more mad. But I have the capacity to think two thoughts at the same time. I am thinking both of these men are deplorable.

907238678283657216 2017-09-11 13:45:31 UTC <tclarke950> We need to make Brannon irrelevant in the real world. Let breitbart be his only home.https://twitter.com/ClintSmithIII/status/907076378650128384

838072890859868161 2017-03-04 17:05:22 UTC <tclarke950> @AP_Politics Shouldn't she have her son buckled in a car seat, or is the President's limo the BEST CAR EVER!
832008661748817920 2017-02-15 23:28:17 UTC <tclarke950> @NRA So what are the facts, NRA?
