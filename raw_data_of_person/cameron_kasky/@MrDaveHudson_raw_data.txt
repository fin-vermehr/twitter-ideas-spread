972206252297277440 2018-03-09 20:23:27 UTC <MrDaveHudson> That's a lot of truth for most of you to handle but here it is. Hilarious and heartbreaking.https://twitter.com/historyinflicks/status/972198191243423744
972195680105254913 2018-03-09 19:41:27 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Trump is 100% going to praise Kim Jong-Un and call him a good guy after they meet.
972190800816820224 2018-03-09 19:22:04 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Remember you can only shame "man crying" if you don't like that man. Then it's hilarious. I'm sorry, but that is how it is.

972181303654264832 2018-03-09 18:44:19 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @estarianne I posted a comment about super delagates and she came after me with insults about my Mother and Father for some reason. She literally posted no arguments, just mental health shaming and insults. So i asked her some questions and got nothing so, I am done wasting my time.  See ya!
972178562651426817 2018-03-09 18:33:26 UTC <MrDaveHudson> This is what someone does when they have zero arguments. Pathetic.https://twitter.com/CandiceAiston/status/972176957172367360
972177596451614720 2018-03-09 18:29:35 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @CandiceAiston Such a strong argument for unregulated big banks and war criminals. I see the error of my ways now that you made such an adult and comprehensive case for your views. A true debating genius!
972176715110809600 2018-03-09 18:26:05 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @CandiceAiston I am starting to think you don;t even know who Kissinger is. Since when is questioning a candidate's relationship with Nixon's head war Criminal or her buddy/buddy relationship with Wall Street cartoonish? So long, Candice. You're just too evasive and disingenuous to talk to.

(Oh! There is that gendered insult again) Do you even read the garbage you write? Go stew in your own shit, you awful enabler. Real people suffer from real problems because you support Wall Street's greed and theft from the elderly and non-whites
972175066397052935 2018-03-09 18:19:32 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @CandiceAiston I don't like Hillary because of her policy! She loves fracking, Wars, drones pipelines, Kissinger, Wall St. money and doesn't support single payer or $15 minimum wage. It's not her gender. What a tired argument from someone who called me an angry white man as an insult. Hypocrite

So no, it's not cool to not know what you are talking about. "Vagabond Guru" you pretentious ass.
972172348399943680 2018-03-09 18:08:44 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @ParkerMolloy Thank you Parker. I have been interacting with Candice Aiston and I needed a good laugh.

All take Wall Street money to deregulate them  and cause a massive financial collapse. AGAIN. Thanks for proving my point that when it comes to the 1%. Repubs and Dems are the same.
972168976909373441 2018-03-09 17:55:20 UTC <MrDaveHudson> What a day! But keep in mind the only reason he is facing real consequences is because he ripped off rich people. If he had stayed with ripping off the sick, elderly and poor, he'd probably have a job at the White House.https://twitter.com/allie_conti/status/972163267736031234
972168228897255429 2018-03-09 17:52:22 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @CandiceAiston So your Mommy issues with Hillary are fair game? Cool, keep avoiding questions about Mommy and her love of war criminals and corrupt business.
972167774754820097 2018-03-09 17:50:34 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @CandiceAiston I asked about Kissinger and Wall Street. Do you need a remedial reading course? (Oh and another photo of yourself is all it would take, genius.)

972164943029112832 2018-03-09 17:39:19 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Imagine thinking that being against Wall St corruption, Wars and secret speeches is being an "Angry White Male" How about actually providing an counter argument? Oh right. You can't.
972164492237901824 2018-03-09 17:37:31 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @CandiceAiston This is amazing. You had no rebuttals, no answers. So you run back to your page to post this so you can have your followers back you up with more insults. Very classy. well, enjoy calling me bro for asking if accepting Kissinger's endorsement was a liberal thing to do.
972163607952789505 2018-03-09 17:34:00 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @CandiceAiston @LASuiter So she didn't give secret Wall Street Speeches? Or do you just say Bernie Bro as a rebuttal?
972162069192691712 2018-03-09 17:27:53 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @CandiceAiston I am going out on a limb here, Candice, but It's probably because you photoshopped Hillary's face over your own in your profile pic. Who's angry? You are the one who popped up to hurl insults and spread mental health shaming, but you just can't help but act like the victim here.
972161143002292224 2018-03-09 17:24:13 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @thehill @jglewis1983 @I_Bresnick @DaJamCommune @CandiceAiston What facts are you referring to? You have stated exactly ZERO facts in this thread. Lots of opinions, a bunch of insults and mental health shaming, but i don't see any facts in your posts, Hillary/Candice.
972160406130233345 2018-03-09 17:21:17 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @thehill @jglewis1983 @CandiceAiston @DaJamCommune Seriously. She literally photoshopped Hillary's face over her own and claims that I am delusional. If she's a parody account, she needs better jokes. I think she is serious.

It's 'your" reality that's falling apart. You know, the one where Hillary is a progressive liberal, instead of someone who accepted the endorsement of Henry Kissinger and gave secret Wall st. speeches.
972154632037429248 2018-03-09 16:58:20 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @thehill @jglewis1983 @CandiceAiston Talk about projection. YOU stole Hillary's face and shopped it over your own! I think you are way past therapy, Candice. Take care and get the help you need to get past the 2016 election. I know losing hurts, especially when you lose to the biggest joke in the US.

I'd keep my views to myself if I supported her. What an embarrassment. Can you imagine spending a BILLION dollars to lose to Donald Trump?  Ouch.
972148148767424513 2018-03-09 16:32:34 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @thehill @jglewis1983 @CandiceAiston I'm not the one who photoshopped Hillary's face over my own in my profile pic. Now THAT is embarrassing. Also, not wanting to bomb people, wreck the environment or help the 1% get more money is good. Worshiping a failure who lost to the biggest joke on the planet is cartoonish.

972097975861370880 2018-03-09 13:13:12 UTC <MrDaveHudson> As regular Americans try and fight Wall St dominance, two corrupt political parties, a tax break for the billionairesnever ending wars and a scourge of shootings helped by terrorists in the NRA, conservatives are fighting against words they don't like.

You know these Dems are bought and paid for by Wall St, just like HILLARY, that's why she picked Tim as VP. Stop pretending.

964941583660539906 2018-02-17 19:16:15 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @ananavarro @wlft1 @ValleyQuercus Well you can thank Hillary for using a pied piper strategy to get Trump to be the nominee so that she had an easy opponent to beat! If I lost to an orange pervert reality star that I helped to push, I would feel shame and embarrassment. Does she?
964939876809543681 2018-02-17 19:09:29 UTC <MrDaveHudson> The comments are amazing, almost all of them are dragging Axelrod for his garbage takes. So nice to see people not swallowing this bullshit anymore. Clinton lost because she is TERRIBLE. She lost to an orange pervert reality star that she pushed to run against.https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/964586348429697026
964938911037485057 2018-02-17 19:05:38 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @davidaxelrod You forgot to blame the all powerful.. SUSAN SARANDON! who single-handedly held down Hillary and forced her to not go to Michigan!
964933847627522049 2018-02-17 18:45:31 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Don;t forget the all powerful SUSAN SARANDON! Ooooo SCARY!https://twitter.com/bourgeoisalien/status/964931098680659969

964902566499901442 2018-02-17 16:41:13 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @SamSeder  What a pathetic, and frankly a hugely disingenuous attack on Jimmy Dore. I expected better from you, Sam. You say you have nothing personal against him, but your personal cheap shots proves that it's a lie. I doubt you care, but I won't be watching  you anymore.

962766436371521538 2018-02-11 19:13:00 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Let's give him that DUE PROCESS he wants by arresting him and putting him on trial for all this shit.https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/962758383634804736
962757153407864832 2018-02-11 18:36:07 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Okay.https://twitter.com/KrangTNelson/status/962756016919244800

962753925068795905 2018-02-11 18:23:17 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Smart move. Inviting a man who killed his son by withholding proper medical attention to a "Wellness" event is the dumbest thing I have seen lately and we literally live in the dumbest time in human history.https://twitter.com/sobeys/status/962745103981928449
962751230014558209 2018-02-11 18:12:34 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Well @realDonaldTrump STEP UP and let's get you some due process... unless you are too CHICKEN? Bwakk Bwakk Bwakk!https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/962734921897963520
962717913139605504 2018-02-11 16:00:11 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @HillaryClinton @krassenstein Got any money left to support one of the thousands of kickstarters fo people trying to pay for medical care in the richest country in the world?
962717542598021121 2018-02-11 15:58:43 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Ego maniac loves book celebrating her. SURPRISE! Maybe you could promote and help fund the thousands of kickstarters for all the people who can't afford medical care instead.https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/962710651008421888
962716774289629184 2018-02-11 15:55:40 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Who had more influence on the 2016 American election? Russia or Wall Street?
962716401587847169 2018-02-11 15:54:11 UTC <MrDaveHudson> When @KeithOlbermann was asked on a fluffy daytime show why Trump is Crazy he says, Trump was nice to me when I lived in his tower. Keep in mind he wrote a book explaining why Trump is crazy and this is the best he could come up with. Great job, moron!
962714081063993344 2018-02-11 15:44:57 UTC <MrDaveHudson> What an amazing interview of @joekennedy by @amjoyshow ! Instead of asking him about silly things like policy or his views or why he invests in big pharma, she just keeps re-asking him if he'll run for Pres after he says no. What an top investigative journalist!
962708288524705792 2018-02-11 15:21:56 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @KeithOlbermann You owe an apologize to George W. Bush? You owe an apology to the One Million murdered Iraqis. You owe an apology to anyone who ever listened to your garbage. Retire, go away. You've 100% lost it.
962692616189022209 2018-02-11 14:19:40 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @BillOReilly Tell it to Dr. Tiller's family you disgusting hypocrite. Your lies led to the man's MURDER in his church. You are pure evil.
962691732600250372 2018-02-11 14:16:09 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @thegarygraham We will use God in place of a perfectly useful word to sound spiritual.....which means absolutely nothing.

962557317626695680 2018-02-10 05:22:02 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @funder She used to tell the truth but now she spews McCarthyism weekly for dump trucks full of cash to protect the corporate dems and grifters like Scott Dworkin. They use Trumps awfulness to push the fake "Resistance" while they approve his spying, and war budget.
962555452344164353 2018-02-10 05:14:37 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @R6Rider @DanielDKraus It's like you've created a... created a... you know, something that gets out of control after you've made it? Ah forget it.

962541111570059264 2018-02-10 04:17:38 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @brianklaas Hypocrite in Chief.
962538776412205057 2018-02-10 04:08:22 UTC <MrDaveHudson> A good man would stand up for the abused not the abusers. A good leader would do the right thing even if it is the difficult thing. But you are not a good man or a good leader, @realDonaldTrump You are a liar, hypocrite and grifter.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/962348831789797381

962522537476403201 2018-02-10 03:03:50 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Hey @WarnerBrosEnt Matt Frewer would make an excellent Joker.
962517812400017413 2018-02-10 02:45:03 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Altered Carbon on Netflix is amazing! Great acting, funny and darkly clever. I am really enjoying it, I didn't think it could get any better and then #MattFrewer Showed up! He's the BEST!
962499617777692672 2018-02-10 01:32:45 UTC <MrDaveHudson> She truly is awful. Bernie gets shit for not being a Dem, but Diane ignores the Dems platform and it's total silencehttps://twitter.com/David4SenateCA/status/962419781302329344
962425908643749889 2018-02-10 20:39:52 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @btenkink I volunteer at my neighborhood school that my kids went to, there  are many kids at risk due to poor homes and broken parents. If we can help them early we can avoid some them falling into crime and addiction.
962423382691270657 2018-02-10 20:29:50 UTC <MrDaveHudson> The U.K., Canada and the US conservatives are always Christians who hate the poor.https://twitter.com/scousegirlmedia/status/962343454910148608

962393677489496065 2018-02-10 18:31:47 UTC <MrDaveHudson> If you don't think Canada has a systemic racism problem with First Nations, just read the comments on any article about indigenous people. It's disgusting. #JusticeForColtenBoushie
962393237863501825 2018-02-10 18:30:02 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @btenkink Petty crime? Well you could install a camera, call the police. Start a neighborhood watch, volunteer with high risk kids, help out a a school that needs good mentors, or jeepers, I guess wait for someone to go on your property and murder them execution style. So many choices.
962384218247565313 2018-02-10 17:54:12 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Can you fuckimh imagine? NOW Is the time? Jesus, could they be worse at this?https://twitter.com/tomperez/status/961973664928468992

962383556583608320 2018-02-10 17:51:34 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @TomPerez It's was actually time when the Repubs shut down the government, so I'll believe it when I see it.
962383028428443648 2018-02-10 17:49:28 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @thehill This turd has no honour.
962381829184655360 2018-02-10 17:44:42 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @AriFleischer But raining down fire and death on innocent woman and children in Iraq is a-okay? Sorry, but I will never believe that you give a shit about domestic abuse.
962381488988872706 2018-02-10 17:43:21 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Hollow words coming from a turd who supported torture and an illegal invasion that killed a million Iraqis. You supported raining down fire on woman and children  but you care about domestic abuse? Fuck off you monster.https://twitter.com/arifleischer/status/962140719988334594
962380677915271168 2018-02-10 17:40:08 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Not sure what is happening with Kim Cattrell and Sarah Jessica Parker but I will always take Kim's side because she was in Big Trouble in Little China.
962378459031986176 2018-02-10 17:31:19 UTC <MrDaveHudson> If you think there isn't a systemic racism against First Nations in Canada just read the comments under any post or story about it. #JusticeforColton
962377772147642368 2018-02-10 17:28:35 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @CharlieAngusNDP Because the system is corrupt and broken.
962363294370750464 2018-02-10 16:31:03 UTC <MrDaveHudson> NO difference at all. Another shameful act against the indigenous people of this country. Canadians like to think the poor treatment is something in the past, it continues to this day. We need to do right for the natives, https://twitter.com/cbcadrianh/status/962155480994013185
962361694306652160 2018-02-10 16:24:42 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @davidfrum What? no wife beating jokes? Oh and do you still retweet white supremacists or have you dropped that now that you are a radical leftist? Oh and do you still support torture and illegal invasions? It so confusing. Thanks

962356704720703493 2018-02-10 16:04:52 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @realDonaldTrump @TheRealJuIian Covering up for abusers and cheating on his wife with porn stars?

961965699471208450 2018-02-09 14:11:09 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @YTCreators Pathetic response. Delete this amoral scumbags account, and while you are at it, stop unsubscribing people from political channels.
961944551383601152 2018-02-09 12:47:07 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @nataliesurely So Bernie is called an honorary woman by a prominent feminist for his policies while Hillary covers for her pig of a husband and covered for her "faith" advisor but Bernie is the misogynist? What a world.
961943328697745408 2018-02-09 12:42:16 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @twittorr I was told by a guard who worked at Millhaven that when he was sent there to await his transfer that the powers gave him a private cell and he was processed immediately. He had powerful friends who helped him even after they all knew. Chilling and disturbing.

961738944026169344 2018-02-08 23:10:07 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Disgusting. Here is a turd that both Clinton and Trump both agree is great. War criminal Henry Kissinger!https://twitter.com/yesihatetrump/status/961680827305349120

I am whining that she won;t support single payer, even though every other major country has it. I am whining that she won't even support a measly $15.

961669493691908101 2018-02-08 18:34:08 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @boehmerB So cons haven't used the term virtue signalling as an insult for years? Give me a break. It's hilariously pathetic. You are absolutely a one dimensional parody of yourselves now.  Being a decent human being? you're doing it wrong.

958885509018812416 2018-01-31 02:11:35 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @politiburr The last grasps of power of a crumbling empire. Trying to hold on to super power status as China blows past them.

958883199429595136 2018-01-31 02:02:24 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @politiburr No, not at all, but sometime I wonder why I bother because I only get likes or retweets if I make a snarky joke on a large profile or play a hashtag game.
958882398783135747 2018-01-31 01:59:13 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @politiburr And too your original post, I think Russia and China are easy boogie men, used to scare people and keep them from looking too hard at their own governments,
958881941218045952 2018-01-31 01:57:24 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @politiburr Do you normally get a lot of responses? Because You and I have similar amounts of followers and I almost never get any engagements on my own posts.

I stopped watching the National years ago after they spent a week with the top story being Micheal Jackson. I decided that, I had enough and cut my cable.

958314297310007296 2018-01-30 12:21:47 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @dirtytomato @jonfavs You are all so cute, it was all over when Bush legalized torture, invaded Iraq, passed the a Patriot act, and then Obama let them off the hook while expanding spying and ordered the first extrajudicial killing of an American. It didn't happen today.

958019808951402496 2018-01-29 16:51:36 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @BooBooNyc Why would I defend Baldwin? Are you seriously claiming he is worse than President Perv? Didn't the Rebups main fundraiser just get arrested for child molesting?
958018181901283329 2018-01-29 16:45:08 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @BooBooNyc President Pussy grabber used to walk into teenage girls dressing rooms and, not sure if your heard, paid of a PORN STAR to keep quiet about his adulterous affair on his THIRD wife, but yeah, Alec Baldwin said something.

Oh and he shut down the government even though he controls the senate and congress. But keep up the paid propaganda.

950454658484629505 2018-01-08 19:50:23 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @JamieGump For sure. I am mostly horrified by what I do know about Oprah. Her promotion of dangerous quacks like Jenny McCarthy, Dr. Oz, Dr, Phil and a whole pile of huckster "psychics" So either she is a gullible turd or she doesn't care if she makes money off of snake oil. Gross.
950452334227804161 2018-01-08 19:41:09 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @JamieGump Not sure why you would think that. my original tweet merely stated what I think Oprah should stand for if she is running and you posted a clip of an interview she did.

950445125607575552 2018-01-08 19:12:31 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @JamieGump She loved to highlight addicts and their recovery but did she ever come out against the racist drug war that effects poor POC more than anyone? Her boy Dr. Phil has just been accused of giving vodka to addicts for a better show.
950444499867664387 2018-01-08 19:10:01 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @JamieGump Well, Oprah isn't saying any of this. The author, Beth Shulman says some great things, does Oprah support them?
950442496642965504 2018-01-08 19:02:04 UTC <MrDaveHudson> If #Oprah truly means what she said in her pretty speech about helping the poorest of the poor she will support $15 minimum wage, single payer and an end to the drug war.

950375094639124480 2018-01-08 14:34:14 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @BethLynch2020 Not just another Billionaire, but one who foisted the hucksters Dr. Phil and  Dr. Oz on the world a slew of con artist "psychics" and "The Secret" where it tells people to wish super-hard for the things they want. USA is FUCKED.
950351624823853057 2018-01-08 13:00:58 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Mikeggibbs Is this a joke? Am I the only one who remembers Oprah as the gullible moron who foisted turds like John Edwards, Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz on us? Not to mention the horseshit that was The Secret?
950350965831593984 2018-01-08 12:58:21 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Apparently all it takes to be a serious contender for President of the United States is to give a really good speech at a celebrity awards show. We are all fucked.
950350230821785600 2018-01-08 12:55:26 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @cameronesposito The genius who brought us surgeon turned grifter, Dr. Oz, Dr. Phil, who gives vodka to alcoholics and The Secret! so everyone can wish really hard for healthcare and retirement savings.
950347218988556291 2018-01-08 12:43:28 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Hey @queensu @Ben_S_Harper is a student of your Economics Department. Is this the kind of garbage you are teaching? or is he stupid all on his own?
950343495402835968 2018-01-08 12:28:40 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @firechild Maybe I will and send Del Toro 10 bucks in the mail#
950214557619904512 2018-01-07 03:56:19 UTC <MrDaveHudson> President #Oprah will provide healthcare to everyone with super fat burners from Dr. Oz, psych advice from Dr. Phil and everyone can use "The Secret" to wish themselves a job and retirement savings. Jesus, you Americans love your moronic, feel good speech giving celebs.
950213389770469376 2018-01-07 03:51:40 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @ShaunKing So she can have con artists like Dr Phil and Dr Oz as advisors? Don't we have enough bullshit in the current whitehouse? She'll make everyone use The Secret to wish themselves some healthcare.
950211423363371008 2018-01-07 03:43:52 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @firechild Zero theatres in my area are showing it and it's double frustrating because I just saw the Del Toro exhibit in Toronto!
950210057223974912 2018-01-07 03:38:26 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Anyone seriously wanting #oprah as President must not remember her promotion of horseshit charlatans like Dr. Oz and Dr. Phil along with every con artist "psychic" she could find. She is a gullible moron and we already have a President like that.

Legalization proves Marijuana prohibition was wrong and pardons will reflect that. Please explain why you haven't.

943198927502938117 2017-12-19 19:18:42 UTC <MrDaveHudson> There is a call for TJ Miller scenes to be reshot for Deadpool 2. I would also love for his scenes to be reshot for the first Deadpool as well. Not for the assault accusations but just because he is an unfunny sack of shit.
943197667609468928 2017-12-19 19:13:42 UTC <MrDaveHudson> TJ Miller always came off as an insufferable turd, so I am not surprised at the accusations, I hope this kills his career so we never have to hear from him again.

940952413128753152 2017-12-13 14:31:51 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Maqaiti @Ellahbie I 100% agree with you, sorry If I came off as pissy, we are both fighting for the same things, I wish you all the best.
940935904423759872 2017-12-13 13:26:16 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @ericgarland Don't you mean brag back the Voting Rights Act on injected Adderall?
940934477546651648 2017-12-13 13:20:35 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Maqaiti @Ellahbie I agree, but I think maybe you missed the point that one bear starving is sad, but not climate science. Bears get injured and can't hunt, it happens. The suicide rate of indigenous is barely acknowledged. It's a media problem.
940933571069521926 2017-12-13 13:16:59 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Maqaiti @Ellahbie The indigenous people of Canada are routinely ignored by the government and the people, but one starving polar bear gets national news. It's abhorrent.

911246682096103424 2017-09-22 15:11:53 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @IrritatingSmirk Well, some people are stupid but clearly it's mostly hyperbole.
911244956395872256 2017-09-22 15:05:02 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @IrritatingSmirk They are laughing at an insult, no one thinks he is anything g other than a scumbag dictator, who trump has previously praised.

911214288739717120 2017-09-22 13:03:10 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @IrritatingSmirk Could you answer the question instead? The POTUS has openly praised multiple dictators, you cool with that?
911213284057124864 2017-09-22 12:59:11 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Pink_About_it Trump said Erdogan "is becoming a friend of mine." U.S. and Turkey "right now as close as we've ever been" thanks to personal relationship.
911212296873144320 2017-09-22 12:55:15 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @IrritatingSmirk Trump said Erdogan "is becoming a friend of mine." U.S. and Turkey "right now as close as we've ever been" thanks to personal relationship.
911211248502607872 2017-09-22 12:51:05 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @IrritatingSmirk Your first response to me was a personal attack after not responding to the POTUS praising multiple dictators. So again, how is the meth?

911206589788491776 2017-09-22 12:32:35 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Pink_About_it So you are cool with Trump openly praising the murderous Dictators of Turkey and the  Philippines?
911206056965152768 2017-09-22 12:30:28 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @IrritatingSmirk Are you talking about Trump praising the Dictators of Turkey and the Phillipines?

911201245658013696 2017-09-22 12:11:20 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Laughing at  #DotardTrump is not siding with dictators. Siding with dictators is Trump praising Edrogan and the nut in the Philippines.

897808029827170304 2017-08-16 13:11:29 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker There is a photo of him in Nazi gear stadimg with Nazis, this "nerd" knew EXACTLY what he was doing.
897807715472478208 2017-08-16 13:10:14 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker I am not going with one photo, there is tons of videos.
897807467245076480 2017-08-16 13:09:15 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker No, The video is all we have, we were not there, it's clear. They are chatting Nazi slogans, carrying Nazi flags. They choose to stay.
897806929426337792 2017-08-16 13:07:07 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker Again, where are this "fine people" at the Nazi rally? The video says otherwise.
897806641348980739 2017-08-16 13:05:58 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker And I disagree, anyone protesting at Unite the Right and the removal of General Lee knows what they are doing.
897806068193128448 2017-08-16 13:03:41 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @standupmonkey @Moosefucker People have gotten away with way worse in America. They call him a kid, say he made a mistake. Poor lad was scared by the scary blacks.
897805400715792386 2017-08-16 13:01:02 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker But you take the President at his word? This is a weird hill for you to fight on.
897805191621300225 2017-08-16 13:00:12 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker So these "other" protestors saw this and decided, it's cool. I am not a Nazi.https://twitter.com/o_ema/status/897553607867990019
897804697037402112 2017-08-16 12:58:14 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker What is accurate is that he is giving cover to neonazis, he is downplaying what they did. Watch the video from Friday, show me the non Nazis
897803386015420422 2017-08-16 12:53:02 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker So if you start seeing confederate flags, swastikas, Nazi chants and still March with them? Do you get to say, oh Not me!
897803036613115906 2017-08-16 12:51:38 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker You should read th FBI report on neonazis infiltrating police forces for decades. They are sympathetic.
897802720169648129 2017-08-16 12:50:23 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker They were chanting bloc and soil, and Jew will not replace us while carrying Nazi flags. There were no concern historians worried about Lee
897802372549881858 2017-08-16 12:49:00 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker Fine people? That's not praise? Fuck that. He hired Gorkin, Miller and Bannon. ALL up front about white supremacy.
897801865517203456 2017-08-16 12:46:59 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker Why didn't the police intervene if there was violence on both sides? great question. How did a car get through?
897801449119383552 2017-08-16 12:45:20 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker He said not all the people there were neo nazis or white supremacists. That is a lie.
897800265042206721 2017-08-16 12:40:38 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @20committee He didn't say Stalin has nothing to do with communism, he said he murdered to retain power which is true.
897799828524150784 2017-08-16 12:38:54 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker So this both sides bullshit don't wash.
897799708529262592 2017-08-16 12:38:25 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker Okay, a woman was murdered and a man was brutally beaten by Nazi fucks, with zero arrests so far. David Duke and KKK both praised Trump.
897798405677867012 2017-08-16 12:33:14 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Moosefucker He tells the truth sometimes?

894031318698397696 2017-08-05 03:04:11 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist Our conservatives think the CBC is a liberal night,are, they have a rinky dink Fox News that is hilarious ply bad.
894030708968235008 2017-08-05 03:01:45 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist No problem, keep up the good fight. Nice talking to you.
894029908430782464 2017-08-05 02:58:35 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist No, we have a large state funded Channel and some smaller ones but they are all owned by huge monopolies, we are gouged for phone/internet
894029571259068416 2017-08-05 02:57:14 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist Yeah, sorry to bring you down, there is a lot to love about Canada, and we do a lot right, I think. Single payer, a good social net.
894029113408851968 2017-08-05 02:55:25 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist We have an ineffectual 3rd party of Left, but the neoliberals up here  have everyone fooled into thinking they are super progressive.

894026134320545797 2017-08-05 02:43:35 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist Yes, the laws are challenged in the courts and challenged on Native territories too, as many are opening selling to taunt the Feds.
894025840383721472 2017-08-05 02:42:25 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist But they confiscate all the marijuana. This view of our friendly PM is such bullshit, but he's super handsome, so he gets away with murder
894025361046085635 2017-08-05 02:40:30 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist It's been grey for sellers for years and many activists believe they don't need permission, and the Feds are busting them and releasing.

894023964506431490 2017-08-05 02:34:57 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist They are still arresting people for possession and our dreamy  PM Trudeau won't call for a moratorium on arrests.
894022877590282240 2017-08-05 02:30:38 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist Lots of big donors and insiders and lots of former cops got licenses to open huge factories of pot growing.
894022064256024576 2017-08-05 02:27:24 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @PandActivist The gov't weed is terrible and they will not be even close to meeting demand, they let the prohibitionists exclude anyone who fought laws
894021058839314432 2017-08-05 02:23:25 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @BillBlair @PandActivist No, they gave out very few licenses and those went to large companies, crazy restrictions on small growers, it's a bad plan,
894015304250077185 2017-08-05 02:00:33 UTC <MrDaveHudson> The Americans are beating Canada in the marijuana race. Pathetic, we could lead the way but we'd rather appease cops like @BillBlairhttps://twitter.com/npr/status/893863166500892672

859762789174431745 2017-05-03 13:33:17 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic Anyway, stay awesome, maybe we can talk about it sometime face to face. All reasonable like. Take care!
859762579547332614 2017-05-03 13:32:27 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic People want Bernie and Warren, but the Dems forced a old school Wash, insider during a time when people wanted change, it was a fatal error
859762282582200320 2017-05-03 13:31:16 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic Final thing today: Hillary opposes $15 min wage. which is the most important thing for poor woman to get ahead. She knows this.
859761797372538880 2017-05-03 13:29:20 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic Anyway, twitter is the worst for this. I like Liz Warren a lot better, as she is a true progressive, people wanted change, Hillary isn;t it.
859761346119958530 2017-05-03 13:27:33 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic The Clintons, exploded the prison population, escalated the drug war and gutted welfare, who do you think this effected most?
859761120638361600 2017-05-03 13:26:39 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic She picked a anti-choice VP. She said, while running, there will NEVER be single payer in US, she is a military hawk. This doesn;t bother u?
859759386696314882 2017-05-03 13:19:46 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic and, again, her policies were so far right, they are indistinguishable from Repubs! That is huge! Oil, Wall St. Corporate money.
859759108983070720 2017-05-03 13:18:39 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic He even encouraged his voters to vote for Hillary, many times, but people want to vote for something not against something and they lost.
859758870100619265 2017-05-03 13:17:42 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic Bernie went on tour with Hillary after he lost, He was the most requested Dem by smaller races to appear at rallies, he is the most popular
859758553913077760 2017-05-03 13:16:27 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic The DNC pre-decided on a candidate that they knew rated as one of the least liked (right or wrong) and they lost to Trump! This is a problem
859757934175285250 2017-05-03 13:13:59 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic Check out #DNCFraudLawsuit to see what is going on within the Dems, it's a current case that is ignored by media and it's frightening.
859756993007038464 2017-05-03 13:10:15 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic Sure, it should be investigated, but if the Dems think it was ALL Russia's fault, they will continue to lose because they have no message.

859743610966855685 2017-05-03 12:17:04 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic The Russians interfere in many elections, so dos the US, they have for years. I do not think Hillary lost due to Russians, it was internal.
859578934815600640 2017-05-02 01:22:42 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic The entire Dem party lost from top to bottom, it;s a party thing, they have no clear vision and are corrupted by corporate cash over workers

859512449183232001 2017-05-02 20:58:31 UTC <MrDaveHudson> This just re-enforces how terrible Hillary's policies were. She is a republican.
859505664837771267 2017-05-02 20:31:33 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @mhamiltonmusic She is pro-war, pro-fracking, pro-drones, pro- Wall St. pro-TPP anti-$15 min wage, anti-single payer. She's a republican!

859501094719893505 2017-05-02 20:13:24 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Being pro-fracking, pro-war, pro-Wall St. money, and being against single payer and $15 min wage had NOTHING to do with it. Gimmie a break.https://twitter.com/funder/status/859470293827506177

856512254270951424 2017-04-24 14:16:49 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @DavidRomeiPHD Carter was the last honest Dem in the White House. Bill and Barack were republicans in policy and Dems in speeches.
856512057570729989 2017-04-24 14:16:02 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @DavidRomeiPHD She lost! Do you not get this? I will even agree with you, but she loves War, drones, fracking, WallSt. TPP, The Dems need to turn left.

856511422251114498 2017-04-24 14:13:30 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @DavidRomeiPHD I guess that's why Hillary supports Pres. Excrement bombing campaigns? It's nice that War is the only thing that brings them together!
856510987146539008 2017-04-24 14:11:47 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @DavidRomeiPHD And when you lose to a pile of excrement, you really need to take a long hard look at yourself. The Dems refuse to do that.

855788629511331841 2017-04-22 14:21:23 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Because he is the only one with any sort of progressive platform.
855788384102625280 2017-04-22 14:20:25 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Then what is the point?
855788157756944385 2017-04-22 14:19:31 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton So then why the fuck does it matter if the goddamn Mayor in fucking Nebraska thinks? It's as inconsequential as it gets!
855787212457332736 2017-04-22 14:15:45 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton This is from June of last year. The most current polls show Bernie as the most popular in US and the Dems are shooting themselves by denying
855786871439450116 2017-04-22 14:14:24 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Again... Is the VP more powerful than a Mayor of Omaha? They are in no way equal.
855785641707266048 2017-04-22 14:09:31 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Bill, I asked why the left goes after the only person pushing for Single payer and $15 min, you said he supports a Omaha Mayor who is anti.
855783851603505157 2017-04-22 14:02:24 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton So Bernie is bad for being pro choice and stumping for the mayor of Omaha but Hillary is good for being pro choice and picking Kaine as Vp.

855769277147881473 2017-04-22 13:04:29 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Oh really? I had no fucking idea. Again, how does a Mayor in a city in Omaha affect federal abortion laws?
855768599943950336 2017-04-22 13:01:48 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Well in the latest polls form Fox to Huffington post they all show Bernie as the most popular across the board. If Dems want to win...
855767653671194624 2017-04-22 12:58:02 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Like the first woman candidate picking an anti-abortion VP? Like that kind of casual alienation? Jesus...
855767067051655169 2017-04-22 12:55:42 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Again, who has more power of abortion rights? A senator who would be VP or a Mayor in Omaha? There is no pure snow candidate.
855766841536503809 2017-04-22 12:54:49 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton People of Color overwhelmingly chose Bernie over Clinton.
855764710221910016 2017-04-22 12:46:20 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton And Bernie STILL is 99% better than a pro-war, pro-fracking, pro TPP anti single payer, anti $15 minumum wage which hurts woman far more.
855764180384854016 2017-04-22 12:44:14 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Do Mayors write laws now? It's a nonsense criticism when Hillary can pick an anti-choice VP but Bernie can;t stump for a measly mayor?
855763031330091010 2017-04-22 12:39:40 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Can I direct you to Tim Kaine, Hillary's anti-abortion VP nominee?
855761191561560064 2017-04-22 12:32:21 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton So Bernie stumps for an anti-abortion Democrat who is running for mayor in conservative Omaha and that negates everything else he does?
855758853035745280 2017-04-22 12:23:04 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @Bill_Templeton Sorry, what?
855755645521362944 2017-04-22 12:10:19 UTC <MrDaveHudson> I just don't get people on the left who shit on Bernie. He is literally the only politician fighting for single payer and $15 min.

842039550876737540 2017-03-15 15:47:27 UTC <MrDaveHudson> This is why the Dems will keep losing. They wouldn't support a measly $15 minimum wage or a ban on fracking. What a joke! Ever hear of FDR?https://twitter.com/mikel_jollett/status/842029822956068864

842029566881353728 2017-03-15 15:07:47 UTC <MrDaveHudson> I loathe Trump. The Dems refusal to do ANYTHING resembling a progressive policy is why they lost. Not Comey, not the Russians. Policy!https://twitter.com/mikel_jollett/status/842028924158722049
842028246577360896 2017-03-15 15:02:32 UTC <MrDaveHudson> No, her love of wars, droning, Wall St. Fracking and attacking Trump over policy is why. Dems need to get this or keep losinghttps://twitter.com/mikel_jollett/status/842027585877950465

816806800754438144 2017-01-04 00:41:31 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Sure but like you said it's politics. She shouldn't care at this point what the talking heads sayhttps://twitter.com/gardengirl1976/status/816806265401802752
816806539495350272 2017-01-04 00:40:29 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @gardengirl1976 doing the right thing isn't supposed to be easy. Anyone else would get called out for normalizing Trump, but she gets a pass

799257640429846528 2016-11-17 14:27:25 UTC <MrDaveHudson> SHE.... LOST.   This is how the American system functions. She lost Pennsylvania. She lost Michigan, she LOST.https://twitter.com/russellbarth/status/799256636174966784
799255863097638912 2016-11-17 14:20:21 UTC <MrDaveHudson> @russellbarth So she did lose?

757752870955462656 2016-07-25 01:42:17 UTC <MrDaveHudson> Hillary loves fracking, War and Wall Street and is lauded as progressive. But Bernie fans are "being ridiculous" okay #sarahsilverman okay.
