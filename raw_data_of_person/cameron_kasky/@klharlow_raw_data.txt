968178586514489344 2018-02-26 17:38:57 UTC <klharlow> @gormanm Kinetic energy is 1/2*(mass * velocity^2), so it would be over 4.5 times, assuming the bullet is equal or greater mass.
968131834847617031 2018-02-26 14:33:11 UTC <klharlow> @coyotesqrl Also, kinetic energy, and thus your proposed rule, should be mass times velocity squared -  ignoring the squared creates a huge loophole. Maybe this could best be summed up as "maximum muzzle energy per minute"? X mass of rounds fired at Y velocity in no less than 60 seconds?
968129870130708480 2018-02-26 14:25:22 UTC <klharlow> @coyotesqrl I like the idea, but for a given gun there is a wide range of available ammunition masses - jacketed rounds, hollow point rounds, long rounds, etc. Second, muzzle velocity is going to be a function of ammunition type and gun characteristics.
966375117671620608 2018-02-21 18:12:37 UTC <klharlow> @CarleneRummery Conservative politics seem to have shifted so far to the right that platforms are now explicitly anti-liberal. It's becoming increasingly difficult to embrace aspects of both red and blue, and we're all the worse for it.
966371781434101762 2018-02-21 17:59:21 UTC <klharlow> @CarleneRummery "As long as I've got mine, screw everyone else" has poisoned right-of-center politics. Explains almost everything we're seeing in American politics and society right now.

This was never a training issue or anything that any operator should be held accountable for. The alert system design is the problem. A well designed system makes simple blunders like this impossible.   Fix the cause, not the symptom.

952613164083904512 2018-01-14 18:47:31 UTC <klharlow> @EverettColdwell Yesterday was a chilling reminder that yes, statistically, our luck will one day run out. That said, we need strong, well-reasoned arguments will help sway public opinion toward eliminating nukes. This Guardian piece was the opposite of that.

952584352965083138 2018-01-14 16:53:02 UTC <klharlow> "Obviously, US nuclear weapons did not deter the terrorist attacks on the US of 11 September 2001, just as the nuclear arsenals of the UK and France have not prevented repeated terrorist attacks on those countries." = the stupidest thing I've ever read. I'm done. Wow.
952583093591859200 2018-01-14 16:48:02 UTC <klharlow> The Cold War, arms buildup, and every reduction/ban treaty has always been 100% predicated on maintaining deterrence through balance of nuclear forces. Take away deterrence from those equations and they all collapse. No other  justifications are sufficient here.
952581831626338304 2018-01-14 16:43:01 UTC <klharlow> Right out of the gate, it's difficult to prove this negative.

908477138621403137 2017-09-14 23:46:43 UTC <klharlow> @nktpnd @code__brew Even if an intercept fails, it's only 1 data point for a singular trajectory - weak justification for any significantly system changes.

907436659062566912 2017-09-11 02:52:13 UTC <klharlow> @Shea_Cotton During this "off season", NK will be analyzing their test data and continuing to develop their tech. THAT is what should be worrying.
907435920802054144 2017-09-11 02:49:17 UTC <klharlow> @Shea_Cotton At this point the world knows how to handle NK missile tests. Worst cases are an off target incident or accidental escalation.

900826176175824896 2017-08-24 21:04:31 UTC <klharlow> @DuitsyWasHere The tank fiber color suggests it isn't carbon fiber, common sense suggests it isn't glass or basalt fiber. What's left? Spectra or aramid.
900545231896150016 2017-08-23 02:28:09 UTC <klharlow> @Joshua_Pollack @dieDoktor You would never ordinarily want to lay up a part at ambient pressure and then cook it below ambient - hello void formation!
900544242115903489 2017-08-23 02:24:13 UTC <klharlow> @Joshua_Pollack @dieDoktor Also, autoclaves are pressurized above atmospheric and are always used WITH vac bagging to achieve max compaction and void elimination.
900543208475832321 2017-08-23 02:20:06 UTC <klharlow> @Joshua_Pollack @dieDoktor See my follow up tweets. It's almost certainly part of a carbon reinforced carbon mfg setup for the nosecone of the RV.
900214556592615426 2017-08-22 04:34:10 UTC <klharlow> @Joshua_Pollack Oh. First paragraph of "Reinforced carbon - carbon" wiki entry says it was developed for nose cones of ICBMs. There you go. Lol.

900212366763339776 2017-08-22 04:25:28 UTC <klharlow> @Joshua_Pollack IIRC, heat is involved, and the end result is carbon precipitates onto the fibers and you wind up with a very strong heat resistant solid.
900211795629133825 2017-08-22 04:23:11 UTC <klharlow> @Joshua_Pollack Loose carbon fiber is pressed into a final shape in a sealed mold, and a carbon bearing gas such as acetylene is pumped in under pressure.
900210585643700226 2017-08-22 04:18:23 UTC <klharlow> @Joshua_Pollack Might actually be a carbon reinforced carbon setup. (!!!) Loose fiber cylinders are the before, the solid carbon hemisphere is the after.
900191464130576384 2017-08-22 03:02:24 UTC <klharlow> @Joshua_Pollack Could be an oven, but vacuum autoclaves are necessarily cylindrical and have round doors. Could also be a controlled atmosphere CNC machine.

864270801968746496 2017-05-15 00:06:31 UTC <klharlow> @DuitsyWasHere Which would certainly be the case if one wheel was nearly locked up!
864268486830428161 2017-05-15 23:57:19 UTC <klharlow> @DuitsyWasHere It would appear the front wheel has a little bit of brake drag...
863154330840567808 2017-05-12 22:10:03 UTC <klharlow> .@cityofwinnipeg @winnipegpolice Hammer laying in the middle of EB Fermor just east of St. Annes. Thor nowhere to be seen. Please retrieve
857803335390420993 2017-04-27 03:47:07 UTC <klharlow> @DuitsyWasHere Even the size of filament seems to vary significantly from one round to the next. Seems to be a very bush league effort.
857802337422909440 2017-04-27 03:43:09 UTC <klharlow> @DuitsyWasHere If it were done by machine, you'd expect the inconsistencies to be repetitive in some pattern. The randomness suggests a manual process.
857801614505259012 2017-04-27 03:40:16 UTC <klharlow> @DuitsyWasHere A machine for doing that style of winding would be VERY simple to build, doesn't have to be CNC, and would have done a better job than this.
857782795321692161 2017-04-27 02:25:29 UTC <klharlow> @DuitsyWasHere IF it's 100% FWC, that surface quality suggests they can't control their winding well enough, so the part is likely full of voids.
857780476840476673 2017-04-27 02:16:17 UTC <klharlow> @DuitsyWasHere That much irregularity in the filament winding suggests a far from optimal process - more likely an overwrap on metal than 100% filament.
857779439236763649 2017-04-27 02:12:09 UTC <klharlow> @DuitsyWasHere The rumples are indicative of very thin sheet metal , but you don't (and can't) weld thin sheet metal sections together w/ big thick beads.
855298365105426433 2017-04-20 05:53:15 UTC <klharlow> @inbarspace What do you mean?
855239862739501057 2017-04-20 02:00:47 UTC <klharlow> @inbarspace If it were 100% fiber we would see flat fiber tows instead of the round yarn see here, and winding pattern would be diagonal not concentric.
855239139368849408 2017-04-20 01:57:55 UTC <klharlow> @inbarspace Single large rib on the left appears to be a weld bead, suggesting metal main casing, finer ribbing on surface could be fiber overwrap.
854846164662964224 2017-04-19 23:56:22 UTC <klharlow> Just saw the @PresChoice #EatTogether commercial, and all I can think about is "wow that's a huge fire code violation". #KeepHallwaysClear

830975085615972352 2017-02-12 03:01:13 UTC <klharlow> Happy birthday to the wonderful @aabywg!
827998903832293376 2017-02-04 21:54:56 UTC <klharlow> @KikiGeebout @Kevs_Kitchen @aabywg There's always that Canadian lad, I think his name is @lance_stroll or something? Heard he's quick! :D
827969977219166209 2017-02-04 20:00:00 UTC <klharlow> @KikiGeebout @Kevs_Kitchen @aabywg Eeeee can't wait! Only 17 days until car launches, too! Bit nervous about how the wide tires will look.
