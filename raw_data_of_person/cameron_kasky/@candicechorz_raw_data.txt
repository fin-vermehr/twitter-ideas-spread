948602131233296384 2018-01-03 17:09:06 UTC <candicechorz> @flavordays Thank you for for educating us more, and I think YouTube should do a much better job monitoring the content that is being posted & being profited from. I have a 2yo and can't imagine letting him when he's older watch YouTube at all for their lack of oversight
948601561617457152 2018-01-03 17:06:51 UTC <candicechorz> @flavordays To not feel empathy or compassion @LoganPaul is a narcissist. To use a sacred land of another culture, particularly one like Japan is really just the grossest behavior imaginable. I've never seen his #shit on YouTube, he epitomizes what's wrong with the US.

948281251051507712 2018-01-02 19:54:03 UTC <candicechorz> @chrissyteigen One of the many sad things about this country. We love to drag a person for making a mistake and or being human. Maybe it's because there's so much hate in this country, maybe it's cultural. But it's also really gross.

The only behavior that needs to change is men not being preditors, and it'd be awesome if women would stop acting like there's anything you can do to stop a man if he's going to attack you.
941798361648177152 2017-12-15 22:33:21 UTC <candicechorz> @pattistanger @Jtown102175 I disagree. Women protect themselves every single day from this type of behavior. Where has it gotten us. When women are blaming/telling other women how they need to protect themselves etc, it's an oxymoron. Because as a woman you know we've been conditioned

938854394182778880 2017-12-07 19:35:05 UTC <candicechorz> @alfranken @EllenBarkin And! Do you decide what your standards are based on the ideals of others? Or do you reach within yourself and say firmly this is wrong and we have to be different going forward. Be open minded but don't stoop to their level simply because we are losing a vote
938853871794847744 2017-12-07 19:33:00 UTC <candicechorz> @alfranken @EllenBarkin Seriously... Do you really want to stand up and support a man after the #metoo scandal and say... Well you're on our side so we'll let this go. You are either with women or against. Let's have a no exceptions policy to violence in any way against women.
938853446752468992 2017-12-07 19:31:19 UTC <candicechorz> @alfranken @EllenBarkin It's not about taking the high road. It's about having fucking standards. We can't go forward without facing our own truths. It's unfortunate to lose him but the path forward does not make exceptions for good guys that grope women.

938475236340596737 2017-12-06 18:28:27 UTC <candicechorz> @Mikel_Jollett I think it's a natural thing ...
