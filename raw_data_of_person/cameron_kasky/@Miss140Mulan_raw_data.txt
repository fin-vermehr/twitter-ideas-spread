967415613789483013 2018-02-24 15:07:10 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @dlhampton But that's the title! Doesn't make me WANT to read it. I've heard things like that for years. "Get over it!" "Try harder." Maybe you should change the title.

And the blanket statement of the "mentally ill" or those with "mental health" issues is wrong. I don't think someone with schizophrenia or with violent tendencies should have guns. But we can't exclude eating disorders or phobias for ex.

962609220792266754 2018-02-11 08:48:17 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @AlwaysDarkHere Most people don't understand. I DO!! I've been there, for a very long time. Not as bad as it used to be. I still feel alone very often. It's so easy to isolate, but it makes us feel worse. You need treatment. I KNOW it feels impossible. YOU"VE GOT TO FIGHT IT! YOU"RE WORTH IT! 
962264662061568001 2018-02-10 09:59:08 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @ColonialSpirits OK today. Thanks for response!
962246839683702784 2018-02-10 08:48:18 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @hemantmehta @legallyraw @Bambambic You obviously don't know the real meaning of a cult.
962216638132248576 2018-02-09 06:48:18 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @AlwaysDarkHere I know. Me too. Your posts make me cry, probably because I relate. Someone would tell us, "You may FEEL worthless, but feelings aren't facts." That's true, but it doesn't stop the feelings. Hope you're in some kind of treatment. Hugs.

931407321489604608 2017-11-16 06:23:04 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @essenviews Look up "hypocrite" in the dictionary. Meaning=often a member of U.S. Republican Party who claims Christian and family values, bit often fails short on actual behavior. (i.e. discriminatory, extramarital sex, child abuse, neglect of sick and poor, etc.)

927797760371412992 2017-11-06 07:19:58 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @funder @annacb421 @zodisgreat That's different from mental illness, though.
927797627948797952 2017-11-06 07:19:26 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @funder @annacb421 @zodisgreat Yes, when religion is radical and taken to the extreme, people can be "brainwashed" and their judgement and behavior can be extreme.

919367784001306624 2017-10-14 01:02:15 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @ABCPolitics Watched again and turned up volume. There is clapping, but it sounds scattered. He didn't get a resounding standing ovation thank God.

918649186836414466 2017-10-12 01:26:48 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @nowthisnews @authentic_april Because they are just as ignorant and full of undue fear and hate, and void of empathy and compassion. I think that's why. 
918642183124725761 2017-10-12 00:58:58 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @TedMicka @drewharwell @JulesLaneK Hear you. If we're not fair with our criticism w/ Trump & team we're not credible. Well done!

918307407574585345 2017-10-11 02:48:41 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @CGramstrup He doesn't know what work is. Signing his name, tweeting insults and having photo-ops is not working. And IT"S NOT WORKING!!!

918278368042323968 2017-10-11 00:53:18 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @WishardCasey @RuffAssassin27 Maybe to help someone else? You think people who feel suicidal are looking for attention???
918278117239685121 2017-10-11 00:52:18 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @WishardCasey @RuffAssassin27 @jazznat99 How do people "realize" what suicidal people feel like? You ever been there???

916166009559674880 2017-10-05 04:59:32 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @mullenp72 @TFLJr I believe they did this out of "a duty to warn." They seriously believe DJT is a danger.
916162256324440064 2017-10-05 04:44:38 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @iamwood79 Attacking/mocking a disability is ignorant and despicable!! I don't follow him, if I did, would unfollow. 
916161273292886016 2017-10-05 04:40:43 UTC <Miss140Mulan> @jonathanhartsf Sarah, I do follow a few people to see what they're saying. Doesn't mean I agree.
