963886636676214784 2018-02-14 21:24:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @vincentdonofrio This is wonderful news!
961853091732574208 2018-02-08 06:43:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @rebeccagberg @jonathanweisman @armandodkos @Brazillian How is that sexist? The equivalent of "my lady" is "my lord". Both are addresses of respect. "My dude" I've never heard before, but it seems more like "my lackey" or something.

957885626551910400 2018-01-28 07:58:24 UTC <kathyfeller> @TaraBusch Ive been reading science fiction since the 60s. Found it all on my own in the school and public libraries.

955867986954395648 2018-01-23 18:21:01 UTC <kathyfeller> @C_Stroop @JeebusTrump @respectlearning @DeepStateAgent2 This happened in the 70s, too.
955576973647998979 2018-01-22 23:04:38 UTC <kathyfeller> @KillerMartinis @sneeje George Lakoff's "Don't Think of an Elephant" explains it pretty well. Not as good vs bad, but as different world views.

916960858562891777 2017-10-08 09:37:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @owillis Which version? I've seen a couple of different ones, and I still like the original version they played in the theatres best.
911461250973839360 2017-09-22 05:24:31 UTC <kathyfeller> @mmasnick I like your design. It works.
911062502103846912 2017-09-21 03:00:01 UTC <kathyfeller> @politicalglutto Yes, and I'm so embarrassed.
911061201420926978 2017-09-21 02:54:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @politicalglutto Sigh, my finger hit the wrong one. I wish there were a way to fix your vote, at least for 10 sec.

899544463864811520 2017-08-21 08:11:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @trekonomics Yep. Me too.
898244211102728192 2017-08-17 18:04:43 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Is he a neoliberal? (Honest question. I don't consider neoliberal to be an insult.) And the 13 points look good. Will read the article.
895831058716934144 2017-08-10 02:15:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion The article is recent, but it doesn't say when the studies were done. Or give links to them so you can look at the actual papers.
895525831883210757 2017-08-09 06:02:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @vandroidhelsing Do you have an ice maker?
895433943775797248 2017-08-09 23:57:43 UTC <kathyfeller> @AngeBassa @envygeeks Yep, that's what I did. Looked at the edges and use peripheral vision.
895132451617488897 2017-08-08 03:59:41 UTC <kathyfeller> @munin When I lived there (I'm a military brat), they didn't really like us Americans.
894492980303732736 2017-08-07 09:38:40 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh maybe "if our culture loses diversity, it's less able to survive change" or something like that?
894477807471939584 2017-08-07 08:38:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh Yep.
888899071963942912 2017-07-22 23:10:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @kristinrawls Yes, my experience is that you need to do that to be listened to. Apparently, they assume everyone exaggerates.
886612142043967488 2017-07-16 15:43:01 UTC <kathyfeller> @nomadj1s @danhauge @Noahpinion *that was a typo. I meant less than white women.
886611760941223937 2017-07-16 15:41:30 UTC <kathyfeller> @nomadj1s @danhauge @Noahpinion I think you missed the article's point. It was about the erasure of POC women and their being less than WM.
882700592170192896 2017-07-05 20:39:55 UTC <kathyfeller> @TonyRomm @karaswisher Perhaps the article didn't cover it, but I didn't see anything about inclusiveness and diversity. The optics look like rich white tech bros.

869745377829728257 2017-05-30 02:40:31 UTC <kathyfeller> @sarahmei So this isn't for mission critical apps, right? Like medical ops, or financial transactions.
863573921861218304 2017-05-13 01:57:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @MJB_SF The article would be more useful if he defined the term in addition to questioning it.

826603439211687937 2017-01-31 01:29:52 UTC <kathyfeller> @byNelleSmith @C_Stroop I'm not sure. We didn't visit him too much and he liked to act wise and secretive.

826505995627008000 2017-01-31 19:02:39 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @TheBigFoxx Are we doing a pool? :)
825818290207363073 2017-01-29 21:29:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @NEWS1130 Is that true? The report said to travel with Canadian passports. Perm Res don't have Canadian passports, just citizens do.
825815050791182337 2017-01-29 21:17:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @LarryJFeller3 He's always been GOP party over the country.
825475443113340928 2017-01-28 22:47:36 UTC <kathyfeller> @elamin88 @Messier1 Because you have to give it up and some countries don't let you or make it very expensive/difficult.
825465675208499200 2017-01-28 22:08:48 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattyglesias @jneeley78 Apparently, they're going by place of birth, which is on your passport.
825462922738479105 2017-01-28 21:57:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @ShaunKing @rosaCTV But not everyone is a citizen in their country of birth.
825462498379730944 2017-01-28 21:56:10 UTC <kathyfeller> @rosaCTV Question. How do they know if someone is dual citizen if they only present 1 passport?
824376069570465792 2017-01-25 21:59:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion Please don't ignore the intersection of those two subjects even if you focus on Econ.
824095623569780740 2017-01-24 03:24:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @DoYouLikeEat @rxpancakes I forget that some times. I'm a Navy brat and things were different then.
824094893899255808 2017-01-24 03:21:48 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion Yep. I feel some survivor's guilt. Plus many friends and family in the US will be hurt by these events.
824094248169414656 2017-01-24 03:19:14 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion Of course it can. But we saw this coming. We emigrated to Canada. Mostly for our son's future. But it will still be bad for us.
824093442917605377 2017-01-24 03:16:02 UTC <kathyfeller> @DoYouLikeEat @Noahpinion Of course you are. You are white, male, young, educated. Live in a blue state.
824091311942746112 2017-01-24 03:07:34 UTC <kathyfeller> @DoYouLikeEat @Noahpinion Okay, obviously I wandered into some weird conversation. Because Noah's tweets make no sense to me.
824090761729712128 2017-01-24 03:05:23 UTC <kathyfeller> @DoYouLikeEat @Noahpinion Well, I was talking about political muscle. Not sure why you're talking about weapons.
824088531685388288 2017-01-24 02:56:31 UTC <kathyfeller> @DoYouLikeEat @Noahpinion Well, mostly seems like to get conservatives, it means being pro-white, pro-patriarchy, pro-Christian.
823786528606277632 2017-01-23 06:56:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @mcnees @trekonomics Harper did that sort of thing with our scientists, etc. Was very, very bad.
821612408745693184 2017-01-17 06:57:17 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion It's good to keep in touch with family and friends that are far away. (That's what I use it for.)
819409316121673728 2017-01-11 05:02:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @HMcFlint @SenSchumer @qbert8008 That includes pregnancy, too.
819403146715742208 2017-01-11 04:38:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @NikitaKitty @RemOscuro This is the 2nd or 3rd time I've heard of it - from different people. Most people might be oblivious, but not all.
819106824087478272 2017-01-11 09:00:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @AllenBolar Based on what the article says and who supports it (Trump, for one), this looks like a push by the anti-regs folks.
819072271226572800 2017-01-10 06:43:41 UTC <kathyfeller> @PhilodoxPils @boldandworthy I thought it was a horrible decision when I read about it. I don't think I'll be able to watch that movie.
818235954058006528 2017-01-08 23:20:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Ah, didn't know that. But that's why the snarky guys do a great disservice. They train us to listen to the idiots, just in case
818235324467793921 2017-01-08 23:17:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Yeah, that's why I thought it was out of context. It's like when you first follow Matty Y. and don't know how to interpret him.
818234409195184128 2017-01-08 23:14:19 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Seems out of context. Like he's talking about "we" not blaming ourselves for social trends and change. And being afraid of it.
817537135540510720 2017-01-06 01:03:36 UTC <kathyfeller> @tauriqmoosa well, it was used for other things. The West calls them Ginger Jars cuz some of them stored ginger. Mostly decorative now.
817282593489989633 2017-01-06 08:12:09 UTC <kathyfeller> @tauriqmoosa That's a Ginger Jar.
817279357714501633 2017-01-05 07:59:17 UTC <kathyfeller> @NativeApprops Is there a site to learn this? Particularly with spoken pronunciation where you can replay it? I'm terrible at spoken Lang.
815305887648661507 2016-12-31 21:17:25 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @salahmaker Exactly. Which why I wonder why Rogoff proposes it.
815305214769012736 2016-12-31 21:14:45 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @salahmaker They aren't unaccounted. Some have jobs and pay payroll taxes. They use paycheck places to convert paychecks to $.
815304671128535040 2016-12-31 21:12:35 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @salahmaker Bankless are people who must use cash. If no cash, they'd be reduced to barter which wouldn't work well in US.
815114492019286016 2016-12-31 08:36:53 UTC <kathyfeller> @salahmaker @trekonomics Ah. He also talked about getting rid of all, but no mention I could find about how bankless people could function.
815113587853099008 2016-12-31 08:33:18 UTC <kathyfeller> @salahmaker @trekonomics Have you read Rogoffs article on getting rid of (some) currency in the US? I haven't heard any other comments on it
814162895562940416 2016-12-28 17:35:35 UTC <kathyfeller> @speechboy71 @TaritaC @ThatEricAlper Rabbit ears
813580188592185345 2016-12-26 03:00:07 UTC <kathyfeller> @anniebellet Good luck!
813218389770452992 2016-12-25 03:02:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @ryanlcooper @JossTheGuy2 He also ignores how much good-for-society work is not paid. Or how many people would strive for more income.
813215972177776640 2016-12-25 02:52:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @rabiasquared Me, too. Just had to explain he was the singer/writer of the Christmas song we kept hearing in the stores last week.
813198581058285568 2016-12-25 01:43:44 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @Noahpinion You do realize that others have, right?
811054967725301760 2016-12-19 03:45:47 UTC <kathyfeller> @polotek @rklau I took the black/white test and was a bit surprised to get the result that I predicted. I'll have to try the others.
810757736229023744 2016-12-19 08:04:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @munin @ErrataRob Yes, I thought they didn't count the votes until when the new congress is seated. Jan 6. So will we know tomorrow?
810315574341316609 2016-12-17 02:47:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @lilithsaintcrow We read that story in grade 9 English. Very well written.
810188621219172352 2016-12-17 18:23:14 UTC <kathyfeller> @cpiazzi @AustaTria You think Russia and US will be on the same side?
810184696550174720 2016-12-17 18:07:38 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike @UMD_CRI @Flipboard Yes, very interesting. The question is different since it doesn't refer to within the respondents lifetime.
810042111399628800 2016-12-17 08:41:03 UTC <kathyfeller> @hugodraws I would be worried about Bannon, Kushner, Pence. And what Ryan and McConnel push thru congress. Trump danger to foreign relations
810040409153945600 2016-12-17 08:34:18 UTC <kathyfeller> @hugodraws The issue is what percentage of the voting population are they. Don't know if the poll had that data.
810038405874581505 2016-12-17 08:26:20 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike So I can see now why some Boomers would feel impact from War, while others don't.
810037688636055553 2016-12-17 08:23:29 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike My family was mostly ok. One side had some hardship. The other side did better and helped those in need. No direct deaths.
810036399541882881 2016-12-17 08:18:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike So, if you're talking about impact only during the event, WW2 had none on me. Sure, had impact on my parents and grandparents.
810035066017456128 2016-12-17 08:13:04 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike The impact of 9/11 was the erosion of civil liberties. This was huge.
810034121355313152 2016-12-17 08:09:18 UTC <kathyfeller> @pewresearch @costrike Ummm. With that reasoning, the Civil War and the American Revolution had bigger impacts on my life than WW2.
810029899805114372 2016-12-16 07:52:32 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike @pewresearch Exactly how do boomers call WW2 the most significant event in their lifetimes when they were born after that event?
810011461267300352 2016-12-16 06:39:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @geofurb @munin Hmmm... There is a huge variety in paper quality. I have business receipts from 5 years ago that are impossible to read now.
810009211161587712 2016-12-16 06:30:19 UTC <kathyfeller> @munin @geofurb Ah, okay. I was thinking his lifetime (and assumed he was younger than me).
810007435284881408 2016-12-16 06:23:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @geofurb @munin Are you using archival quality paper? (Ex. I have written papers from 40 years ago that I need to scan - they are so faint.)

809483847695941632 2016-12-15 19:42:43 UTC <kathyfeller> @chel_c_cam A thousand times yes!
809066090705756161 2016-12-14 16:02:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @scalzi @hanlsp @grrrr_shark BC is not so bad. That's why we moved here rather than elsewhere in Canada. :)
808958088979955712 2016-12-14 08:53:32 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion It seems good, but I haven't seen enough of it yet to have an informed opinion. But it also looks like it would hurt Trump biz.
808956624182198273 2016-12-14 08:47:43 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @FT Is there more info on it? Quotes in the article kept saying there was more to it than the import/export deduction changes.
808927440793989121 2016-12-13 06:51:45 UTC <kathyfeller> @playcritically @AmyDentata @alendrel Have you read Trekonomics?
808897811060297729 2016-12-13 04:54:01 UTC <kathyfeller> @rundo67 I have found that studying the economic reasons behind political policies to be personally enlightening (although often depressing)
808896431708917760 2016-12-13 04:48:32 UTC <kathyfeller> @rundo67 Politics and economics are intertwined. Do you study global economics?
808894475040858113 2016-12-13 04:40:46 UTC <kathyfeller> @rundo67 I was referring to his statement on TV and his Tweets, not just the phone call. Not good ways to approach changing a key policy.
808887788208672768 2016-12-13 04:14:11 UTC <kathyfeller> @rundo67 I don't hate Israel. I'm Jewish. Also, I don't fit very well on the left/right political spectrum.
808887439565590528 2016-12-13 04:12:48 UTC <kathyfeller> @maxgladstone @taxingnihilism That's why govts are so concerned with the unemployment rate of young men.
808884970571730946 2016-12-13 04:02:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @rundo67 No. I disagree with Trump's purpose and method.
808884460225605632 2016-12-13 04:00:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @oneNychthemeron @pvineetha We're avoiding smart things and don't have a choice about our ISP router. But we're also not average.
808345766964039680 2016-12-12 16:20:23 UTC <kathyfeller> @lanegreene @GlennF They also seem to think that the highest corporate rate is what the large corporations actually pay.
806689809951395840 2016-12-07 02:40:12 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh Ah, yes. Killing TPP. I do give him credit for that. I have to remember not to forget that.
806689052917264384 2016-12-07 02:37:12 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh I am curious what you think that Trump has done that is good. Honest, I want to see if I've missed something.
806418983691784192 2016-12-07 08:44:02 UTC <kathyfeller> @CdnDemocracy Why wasn't technology or engineering a choice in the occupation?
806274814532931584 2016-12-06 23:11:10 UTC <kathyfeller> @ThatEricAlper The complexity of our world and how black/white/binary thinking causes us to overlook problems and ignore viable solutions.
805692950411808768 2016-12-05 08:39:03 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike @iwelsh Yes, female POC have it the worst. How do you define POC? (I discovered that some companies define it differently.)
805676060968775680 2016-12-04 07:31:56 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike @iwelsh There are actual scientific tests comparing sexism to racism for resumes? I've seen tests, but never comparing those two.
805670796618133504 2016-12-04 07:11:01 UTC <kathyfeller> @AndreaChalupa @obbiecole @Schenck @just_maxx1 @Cybelline One thing to remember is Obama couldn't run again. Merkel can.
805662108356481024 2016-12-04 06:36:29 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion Well, that article explains why some of those with good jobs still had economic anxiety.
804962100690812928 2016-12-03 08:14:54 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @hiltzikm This is not even a question. No state is going to secede.
804019937706545152 2016-11-30 17:51:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @meakoopa There was an explanation that 44's tweets will be moved to a different Twitter account for posterity. And that 45 will start anew.
803910136532123648 2016-11-30 10:34:47 UTC <kathyfeller> @SteveHiltonx @davies_will Trump is appointing elites. Very rich elites.
803908374815338496 2016-11-30 10:27:47 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh Agreed.
803908293911425024 2016-11-30 10:27:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh Yes. Trump is clever. Bannon is intelligent. Plus some of the others as well. That's why I'm watching to see how it goes.
803906242326343681 2016-11-30 10:19:18 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh Yes. And I think Romney thinks he can endure that until Pence is in control. I am watching to see how it will play out.
803902891589128193 2016-11-30 10:05:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @hugodraws @cornydeviless Hmmm. When I was there, the common pocket knife was allowed. Which is why they defined the length. No switchblades
803901787899973633 2016-11-30 10:01:36 UTC <kathyfeller> @hugodraws @cornydeviless I thought that was concealed?
803901332721528832 2016-11-30 09:59:48 UTC <kathyfeller> @RemOscuro Most of them, I think. But long ago.
803899396228149248 2016-11-30 09:52:06 UTC <kathyfeller> @RemOscuro They're human. Even the well intentioned ones get subverted by the system. See Third Wave (Tofler) for how institutions survive.
803898812913754113 2016-11-30 09:49:47 UTC <kathyfeller> @AmyDentata Religion is used as a tool by those in charge to keep the masses under control. Been that way since recorded history began.
803897905568354304 2016-11-30 09:46:11 UTC <kathyfeller> @RemOscuro You're a better person than me.
803895428898910208 2016-11-30 09:36:20 UTC <kathyfeller> @RemOscuro I had no such hopes. She's done pretty much what I expected. (Well, I did hope I was wrong.)
803893956681482240 2016-11-30 09:30:29 UTC <kathyfeller> @ClaraJeffery @rbtastic Yes, she's bad. But edu could be fixed after setback. Sessions could destroy voting and civil rights for decades.
803878111888584704 2016-11-30 08:27:31 UTC <kathyfeller> @polotek @VanguardVivian Apparently, I have much more in common with Millennials than my own generation (boomer).
803873950484697088 2016-11-30 08:10:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @jpwarren @NewtonMark Hmmm. That's a good point.
803873595650781184 2016-11-30 08:09:35 UTC <kathyfeller> @glynmoody Ah, okay. I misread.
803873427178356736 2016-11-30 08:08:54 UTC <kathyfeller> @polotek I think I've seen all but the last Dark Knight Batman - since Jack's version. I haven't seen Afleck's yet.
803872809147432961 2016-11-30 08:06:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @glynmoody Wait. You're for the TPP?
803872444545011713 2016-11-30 08:05:00 UTC <kathyfeller> @polotek What did you think of the other Batman movies?
803870859915972608 2016-11-29 07:58:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @RemOscuro Not really surprising, considering her positions for the last several years.
803862842982076416 2016-11-29 07:26:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @voxdotcom @MazMHussain @RosaGoldensohn @scottsantens How you handle health care on that amount? Did I miss that in the article?
803337386377678848 2016-11-28 20:38:52 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @mmmPi It's more than that. This is the appeal to people with my background who accepted subtle racism as normal and proper.
803117595138224128 2016-11-27 06:05:30 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @ezraklein @MegaphonePods He says "our populism" and "the weapon" - not "our weapon". I don't think the race weapon is ours.
803114778092679169 2016-11-27 05:54:18 UTC <kathyfeller> @RealLucasNeff I don't think it undermined it at all. Continued to show he only thought about himself.
803055776948305920 2016-11-27 01:59:51 UTC <kathyfeller> This is a good article on what's happening. https://thinkprogress.org/when-everything-is-a-lie-power-is-the-only-truth-1e641751d150#.jzbyu5i0l
803054913479589892 2016-11-27 01:56:26 UTC <kathyfeller> @Jesse_Hirsch @kristinrawls I completely understand. Self care can be difficult to manage, esp in these times. Just do what you can do.
803038404149579776 2016-11-27 00:50:49 UTC <kathyfeller> @kristinrawls Take some time for yourself. Don't forget to practice self care.
803037282471030785 2016-11-27 00:46:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @NewaHailu @boldandworthy @skrossa Yes. Usually it's money. I worry that it will change now to other methods. Watch for law's side effects.
803033643128012804 2016-11-27 00:31:54 UTC <kathyfeller> @NewaHailu @boldandworthy @skrossa I've seen the Federal govt force states to do stuff. Don't be so sure that Cali. is safe.
803027787678302208 2016-11-27 00:08:38 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattblaze The one world govts are only a problem when they don't think it's their team/guy running it.
803021694763814912 2016-11-27 23:44:26 UTC <kathyfeller> @DrJJoyner @maxjrosenthal Perhaps their purpose should change to reflect what happens now. At least they could be truthful, not misleading.
802970282390482945 2016-11-27 20:20:08 UTC <kathyfeller> @qz @elonmusk @scottsantens But he can't be president so they may be more worried about his celebrity popularity.
802947690430509056 2016-11-27 18:50:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @yaelwrites Could you be more specific?
802947007480377344 2016-11-27 18:47:39 UTC <kathyfeller> @nsfinch @lschmeiser Has it changed? Used to start in your mid-40s and then become quite common in your 50s.
802939893483642880 2016-11-27 18:19:23 UTC <kathyfeller> @boldandworthy @studentactivism Yes, but I see most people's support for white supremacy is via inaction. (That does show their priorities.)
802770459158712321 2016-11-26 07:06:06 UTC <kathyfeller> @elidourado @mattyglesias @joshtpm @KatzOnEarth @RegalPastry I sincerely hope not.
802739887971573760 2016-11-26 05:04:38 UTC <kathyfeller> @tressiemcphd That looks wonderful. And brings up good, tasty memories!
802359618068328448 2016-11-25 03:53:34 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattyglesias Bloomberg could have been a possibility - he considered it. Biden had tragic family circumstances.
802042300234743808 2016-11-24 06:52:40 UTC <kathyfeller> @pwthornton @gkfahnbulleh There's plenty to do that's fulfilling work, but not paid.
801844067516628992 2016-11-24 17:44:57 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike @UBS I'd say I already spend time helping others. Been doing that for years. Interesting that UBS assumes people aren't.
801663232599429120 2016-11-23 05:46:23 UTC <kathyfeller> @ezlusztig @JossTheGuy2 But if the states still control who can vote in their state and where/how many polling stations?
801165012383301632 2016-11-22 20:46:38 UTC <kathyfeller> Well-written and well-reasoned article about how the alt-right/fascists work https://benjaminstudebaker.com/2016/11/22/how-the-alt-right-works/
800935558868406272 2016-11-21 05:34:52 UTC <kathyfeller> @ObsoleteDogma @iammattcote I would say Hannity because I think Coulter wouldn't even care about the jobs part.
800918907468988416 2016-11-21 04:28:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion I really enjoyed it. Thanks for reminding me to watch it again. :)
800745540430348289 2016-11-21 16:59:48 UTC <kathyfeller> @HJBenjamin @ajplus What private property? Why am I in this mention? What are you talking about?
800573182008696833 2016-11-20 05:34:55 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Have you been following K. Rogoff? He was talking about getting rid of high bills.
800570296298131456 2016-11-20 05:23:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @pattyjansen Passive aggressive, with excessive jealousy. Or borderline personality disorder. Or manipulative and wheedling.
800423710490402816 2016-11-20 19:40:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @rabiasquared @GlennF @speakercode Yes. I think it will come down to how smart the 2 sides are. Basically Trump/Bannon vs. Ryan/Pence.
800247373486178304 2016-11-20 08:00:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @costrike I've seen people think and say that many times about unions. Mostly in non-union environments.
800246134945910785 2016-11-19 07:55:21 UTC <kathyfeller> @KiranOpal Could you explain why lists are bad? I did try to find something about Twitter etiquette, but was unsuccessful.
800244200407121920 2016-11-19 07:47:39 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion You're joking, right?
800222747250991104 2016-11-19 06:22:25 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @lisabari I said other and pretty much agree with what Lisa Bari says.
800148188501946368 2016-11-19 01:26:08 UTC <kathyfeller> @ekstasis @trekonomics If not enough EC votes, then the new House decides after they are seated. Not the lame duck one. 2/2
800147862986182656 2016-11-19 01:24:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @ekstasis @trekonomics I read this last year. I hope h updates it and fixes the error in the paragraph about the House electing the pres. 1/
800137591794192384 2016-11-19 00:44:02 UTC <kathyfeller> @Chris_arnade How exactly is this a "rant"? Seems more like a vignette.
800133713392586753 2016-11-19 00:28:37 UTC <kathyfeller> @kelly_j_baker @bluebelletrist Hmm... So a computer scientist who doesn't use social media at all? I hope he's not working on modern apps.
800082238910013440 2016-11-19 21:04:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @NerdNumbers @Noahpinion Question for Noah. Are you personally reaching out to them?  Seems like you're just lecturing for others to.
800081269396643841 2016-11-19 21:00:14 UTC <kathyfeller> @JuddLegum @ScottChickee Oh, I figured you meant air.
800079500654448640 2016-11-19 20:53:12 UTC <kathyfeller> @JuddLegum @ScottChickee Yes.
800077940297842688 2016-11-19 20:47:00 UTC <kathyfeller> @JuddLegum @ScottChickee He will last at least as long as the GOP majority find him useful, maybe longer if his backers powerful enough.
800077509270192128 2016-11-19 20:45:17 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Yes and stuff from Twitter ends up on Facebook. At least, from what I've seen - FB posts 1-2 days after I see it on Twitter.
800075484667080705 2016-11-19 20:37:14 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @AndrewCFrancis Now, I must reread the beginning.
800074359792513024 2016-11-19 20:32:46 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion The only way you're going to get my pro-Trump relatives and friends to listen is to become like them - basically like Pence.
800071921400303616 2016-11-19 20:23:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @thinkpiecebot I seriously doubt most boomers are on Twitter. Lots on Facebook, though.
800069396240605184 2016-11-19 20:13:03 UTC <kathyfeller> @dandrezner @mattyglesias Well, it would seem something serious is happening in the deep state if confusing things like this are bubbling up
800068526274793474 2016-11-19 20:09:35 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion It's difficult to do that if they refuse to have anything to do with you unless you become just like them.
799460014339420160 2016-11-17 03:51:35 UTC <kathyfeller> @scottsantens @overhere1 I hope hotels don't go away. I wouldn't be able to travel. I can't stay in people's homes because of my allergies.
799389423095775232 2016-11-17 23:11:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @costrike Yeah, but I'm wondering if that ship already sailed. It's certainly happening faster than we thought it would.
799382636779094016 2016-11-17 22:44:07 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics I see one blind spot in this speech. Many people, esp the poor, do not have time to be informed. They are too busy surviving.
799345278377570304 2016-11-17 20:15:40 UTC <kathyfeller> @courtneymilan @miyukijane I thought most police, border people were already pro-Trump (in general).
799323879634137088 2016-11-17 18:50:38 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattyglesias Really? Where?
799308764734074881 2016-11-17 17:50:34 UTC <kathyfeller> @GlennF Ummm. You do realize it's explained in one of the later books?
799140119148040192 2016-11-16 06:40:26 UTC <kathyfeller> @leahmcelrath @Schenck @edbookclub Isn't there a process for congress to challenge and throw out elector votes? So with a Repub House...
798974926921175040 2016-11-16 19:44:01 UTC <kathyfeller> @tinybuddha @blue_by_design @vadobanane It's not your job to see the best in your abuser or help them to grow. Someone else can do that.
798911380162101249 2016-11-16 15:31:30 UTC <kathyfeller> @owillis @doccandidate Also allows them to get a public reaction to potential picks while discrediting the media.
798771595598643200 2016-11-15 06:16:03 UTC <kathyfeller> @boldandworthy I think so. If not, he popularized it.
798733625915109376 2016-11-15 03:45:10 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattyglesias I see that the memorandum is signed now. Pence is in charge of the transition. He still doesn't seem too good.
798731740189626368 2016-11-15 03:37:41 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattyglesias Pence hasn't even signed the legal paper so they can start the transition. Isn't that alone a problem?
798680955686789120 2016-11-15 00:15:53 UTC <kathyfeller> @RadioFreeTom Yes, Facebook is an issue when it's family and friends. I have that problem.
798680149071826944 2016-11-15 00:12:40 UTC <kathyfeller> @RadioFreeTom Hmmm, I can just block social media. Can't block the people every day or at work. But I do get your point.
798678663478681600 2016-11-15 00:06:46 UTC <kathyfeller> @RadioFreeTom Face to face shaming has been around since humans have had communities. pulpit shaming was big when I was a kid.
798670686793252864 2016-11-15 23:35:04 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion Why did you change your picture back?
798640547707486208 2016-11-15 21:35:19 UTC <kathyfeller> @JonathanCohn But wouldn't they just impeach him and make Pence president? Then put thru the legislation again?
798585910803591168 2016-11-15 17:58:12 UTC <kathyfeller> @ApocalypticaNow Their constituents will still vote for them. It's always "the other districts' reps who should be voted out".
798547897193111552 2016-11-15 15:27:09 UTC <kathyfeller> @Popehat That's not really surprising. The typical commenters are like that.
798546694270947328 2016-11-15 15:22:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @leeflower @texmandie Yes, I used that. Sent me to the right site, but it can't fix the catch-22 thing. I will have to call the county.
798382007940042752 2016-11-14 04:27:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @leeflower We followed the process twice. Never got a ballot. Process changed, but looks like we're now in some catch-22. Thanks anyway.
798380696544768004 2016-11-14 04:22:45 UTC <kathyfeller> @leeflower Hmm. That would be difficult. The state says go to county. County says we must have proof we live there.
798372644659687424 2016-11-14 03:50:46 UTC <kathyfeller> @leeflower So, citizens living in a different country don't count?
797958399950323712 2016-11-13 00:24:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Yes, but some of those backward swings have been terrible times in history.
797876930401878018 2016-11-13 19:00:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @FirstTimeTrek Yes, but who is going to stop him?
796947748855496704 2016-11-10 05:28:44 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @julian_molina They're on FB. I saw the tweeted links migrate to FB 1-2 days later in most cases.
796924550030053376 2016-11-10 03:56:33 UTC <kathyfeller> @leahmcelrath @dreamitnowdoit there's a process for congress to throw out electoral college votes. Been a long time since they've done that
796838423554179072 2016-11-10 22:14:19 UTC <kathyfeller> @jaketapper Of course he is. Why am I not shocked?
796610097497522176 2016-11-09 07:07:02 UTC <kathyfeller> @BusquedaJess @JettGoldsmith The electors don't meet (by state) until Mon after 2nd Wed in Dec.
796466446599454720 2016-11-09 21:36:13 UTC <kathyfeller> @TheNewThinker It's white supremacy. Because without it, we would have solved much of the economic anxiety and middle class issues.
796280892171816960 2016-11-09 09:18:53 UTC <kathyfeller> @alwaystheself That's not really surprising. Heard reports of higher than expected turnout of older whites (not typically feminist or lib).
796133975479578624 2016-11-08 23:35:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @tressiemcphd When he listed those 3 groups, I immediately assumed the non-whites would be the arbitrator between the 2 white groups.
795332163147157504 2016-11-06 18:28:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @jhkennedy @SeanMcElwee @costrike I read one of them says they plan to vote differently even though it is mandatory. (I might have misread.)
795180942042091520 2016-11-06 08:28:04 UTC <kathyfeller> @JuliaFBXLawRpt I got 19.
795180686978138123 2016-11-06 08:27:04 UTC <kathyfeller> @ZacEfronDaiIy @TweetedQuizzes @csanchezdanny I got 19. I'm 58. Hmmm....
795137694573600768 2016-11-05 05:36:13 UTC <kathyfeller> @housetrotter @trekonomics materialist? Is that a defined term that I've missed?
795135840330489856 2016-11-05 05:28:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @housetrotter @trekonomics You're a Marxist?
795031758139834368 2016-11-05 22:35:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @owillis Keypunch machine. I used those.
794974127895384065 2016-11-05 18:46:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @jamesykwak @costrike But good intent doesn't mean they aren't dismissive and arrogant. If trying to persuade, tone is important
794669359507468292 2016-11-04 22:35:14 UTC <kathyfeller> @juliadahl @kristinrawls Yes, but is there enough time to get them to polling places?
794668033167896576 2016-11-04 22:29:57 UTC <kathyfeller> @quinncy @20TwoToes @emilynussbaum Yes, I understand all that. And that only supports my point (which I must be poorly expressing).
794667095128559617 2016-11-04 22:26:14 UTC <kathyfeller> @quinncy @20TwoToes @emilynussbaum I don't think his affection for his daughter is going to translate into protecting Jews.
794665623921913856 2016-11-04 22:20:23 UTC <kathyfeller> @quinncy @20TwoToes @emilynussbaum If he has contempt for women, how would his daughter being a Jew mean anything?
794612424410157056 2016-11-04 18:48:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @NatGeo @gonealgonow When we lived in Guam, my 6 year old brother and his friend caught one.
794610190481883136 2016-11-04 18:40:07 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike Define full employment. Or is there a standard definition already?
794602611320098819 2016-11-04 18:10:00 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @outline Unfortunately, no. I was pretty dismayed when I read about it. When did vigilante become a good thing?
794600520056901633 2016-11-04 18:01:41 UTC <kathyfeller> @courtneymilan I read these back in the 60s. I assumed those comments were meant to show bigotry, etc. I didn't agree w/ them.
794434183997190145 2016-11-04 07:00:43 UTC <kathyfeller> @Pinboard Oh, I was over thinking it then. I started using HTML in 95.
794429780208648192 2016-11-03 06:43:14 UTC <kathyfeller> @Pinboard Which technology from 97? My memory is apparently not so good.
794419455354802176 2016-11-03 06:02:12 UTC <kathyfeller> @JonRiley7 You don't transfer your email to your new machine when you upgrade your hardware?
794410620279848960 2016-11-03 05:27:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @scarequotes @GlennF Lots of sexism exists. And a strong feeling against women leaders by both women and men in some groups of people.
794398859191459841 2016-11-03 04:40:21 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @maggieNYT Somewhere, someone is now insisting that it just means David Duke deserves more ammo.
794050046069116928 2016-11-02 05:34:18 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics It's been deleted.
794043496214577152 2016-11-02 05:08:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @pattyjansen @CoraBuhlert Yeah, I argued about that when I was a kid (as an American). Seems weird to call it the World Series.
793924015534448640 2016-11-02 21:13:30 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @JoMicheII I'll have to look at that when I have time. A lot of studies have built-in gender/cultural bias.
793842615829483520 2016-11-02 15:50:03 UTC <kathyfeller> @JoMicheII @Noahpinion Hmmm. My aptitude tests showed high language, high math, high spatial, mechanical. I love systems.
793771603343450112 2016-11-02 11:07:52 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion I would guess you are used to women peers and are not personally insecure.
793767319893749761 2016-11-02 10:50:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @JoMicheII @Noahpinion I think the reasons in the sexism article has a lot to do with it - for Econ. But I have no data.
793766988820586496 2016-11-02 10:49:32 UTC <kathyfeller> @JoMicheII @Noahpinion in Grade 7, I mean.
793766842355490817 2016-11-02 10:48:57 UTC <kathyfeller> @JoMicheII @Noahpinion I did however get a math aptitude test that put me into the honours program.
793766520539131904 2016-11-02 10:47:40 UTC <kathyfeller> @JoMicheII @Noahpinion I took the SAT in 74 or 75.
793766259040976896 2016-11-02 10:46:38 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @JoMicheII Also, the chart in Noah's article is SAT in 7th grade. So that's changed? We didn't have SAT until 10 or 11.
793765248368975872 2016-11-02 10:42:37 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @JoMicheII Yes, I read that piece. Made good points.
793763470625742848 2016-11-02 10:35:33 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @JoMicheII Yes, so when my internal preferences conflicted with societal ones, I became an "outsider" and weird. (Professionally
793762174535479296 2016-11-02 10:30:24 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion Right. I was more focused on career and profession. I'm sure that can be true for guys.
793761527031406593 2016-11-02 10:27:50 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion Is that mostly based on your gender for you? Mine was, because I was explicitly told.
793760931696095233 2016-11-02 10:25:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @JoMicheII @Noahpinion True, but I have lots of experience in being told I wanted something different than what I thought on my own.
793759997029003264 2016-11-02 10:21:45 UTC <kathyfeller> @JoMicheII @Noahpinion How about "stronger" then?
793759420039561216 2016-11-02 10:19:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @JoMicheII @Noahpinion Superficially, yes. I know that I was certainly steered away from my natural preferences. But I'm older.
793757363572322304 2016-11-02 10:11:17 UTC <kathyfeller> @JoMicheII @Noahpinion I would suggest cultural expectations before preferences.
793713947765383170 2016-11-02 07:18:46 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike Just some of Skynet's weapons. I believe Google is working on Skynet :)
793581063360483331 2016-11-01 22:30:44 UTC <kathyfeller> @David_Boreanaz I already do that.
793203617503162368 2016-10-31 21:30:54 UTC <kathyfeller> @boldandworthy Ah okay. 2 things I remember - US put pressure on banks to deny donations to Wikileaks, pressure on Sweden for extradition.
793199701294141440 2016-10-31 21:15:20 UTC <kathyfeller> @boldandworthy Umm... Is that a serious question? Cuz I'm not interested in defending Assange.
793195731603435521 2016-10-31 20:59:33 UTC <kathyfeller> @boldandworthy Yep. Basically the Obama administration, including HRC, have hurt him. He's trying to hurt them back.
793194575464542208 2016-10-31 20:54:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @boldandworthy Revenge
793154222426501120 2016-10-31 18:14:37 UTC <kathyfeller> @scottsantens That's a good way to phrase the difference.
793145244329971712 2016-10-31 17:38:56 UTC <kathyfeller> @owillis @FDRforever Even stuff in your browser is downloaded into a cache.
793144911931412481 2016-10-31 17:37:37 UTC <kathyfeller> @owillis In order to view something on your device, it has to be on the device.
792975212551639040 2016-10-30 06:23:18 UTC <kathyfeller> @AmyDentata Isn't it making people sick?
792974733222346752 2016-10-30 06:21:23 UTC <kathyfeller> @geekwire @costrike @trekonomics I found his talk informative. Gave me insight into how some tech leaders think.
792973902045597696 2016-10-30 06:18:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @geekwire @costrike @trekonomics Which assumptions? Infinite growth?
792973746923417600 2016-10-30 06:17:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @geekwire @costrike He mentioned awhile back, at The Recode thing. He mentioned earth zoned residential and light industry. I wonder if that means only elites?
792831039936749568 2016-10-30 20:50:24 UTC <kathyfeller> @AstroKatie @IngeborgRakvag You can remove someone by clicking on "others" and deselecting them in the pop up.
792830724273414144 2016-10-30 20:49:09 UTC <kathyfeller> @AstroKatie Also, before I could easily see when someone was replying to someone I'd blocked. Makes understanding the discussion harder now.
792820573235650560 2016-10-30 20:08:49 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @jamesykwak Public, please.
792802090032635904 2016-10-30 18:55:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @FiveThirtyEight @mattyglesias Is that household income or individual? Because if household, than older couples vs younger singles means income per person is different.
792081193252458496 2016-10-28 19:10:47 UTC <kathyfeller> @DavidCornDC Perhaps Comey just wants to ensure HRC doesn't have a landslide and a clear mandate.
791810457606598656 2016-10-27 01:14:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @deray @Brazillian They are different.
791502595428720641 2016-10-26 04:51:38 UTC <kathyfeller> @verge @Recode I think drivers have more than enough distractions. This is... no, just no.
791382990731345920 2016-10-26 20:56:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @scottsantens I would do a series of 2 year projects in writing, education, software while continuing my ongoing volunteer work.
791171254711623680 2016-10-25 06:55:01 UTC <kathyfeller> @AstroKatie @jessiesarah I once accidentally misspelled a coworker's name as Jesse - she informed me that Jesse is the male spelling.
791164164454645760 2016-10-25 06:26:50 UTC <kathyfeller> @willmenaker @chris_anastasia @iwelsh Yes, but it was a lie.
791162891626024964 2016-10-25 06:21:47 UTC <kathyfeller> @chris_anastasia @iwelsh @willmenaker That also happened several times in the 90s and the 00s. The plans went up and the benefits went down.
791161390132322304 2016-10-25 06:15:49 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Or possibly a breakthrough in computer technology. I keep seeing stuff that shows researchers are working on that and on energy
791154064935485441 2016-10-25 05:46:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @alwaystheself I think you're clear in all your tweets. I learn things.
791144188620472320 2016-10-25 05:07:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @anniebellet @OnStarshipsBlog Donna Augustine's Karma, Shadow Sight by EJ Stevens, Impervious by Laura Kirwan. (And Annie's, of course.)
791142868635222016 2016-10-25 05:02:13 UTC <kathyfeller> @OnStarshipsBlog @anniebellet You mean, like Amanda Lee's witch books?
791136373742919680 2016-10-25 04:36:24 UTC <kathyfeller> @wikileaks This isn't any thing different than what Apple has publicly said. Although you do need to be paying attention.
791118856391536640 2016-10-25 03:26:48 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion @bldgblog Neither.
791067213222416385 2016-10-25 00:01:35 UTC <kathyfeller> @bldgblog @trekonomics People have been blaming boomers for over a decade (or 2) now. It gets tiresome. We're not all the same.
791065911318843392 2016-10-25 23:56:25 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @bldgblog Sigh. I'm a boomer.
790801383997919232 2016-10-24 06:25:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion I thought services was where the jobs are supposed to be.
790798763358957568 2016-10-24 06:14:52 UTC <kathyfeller> @pattyjansen That's great!
790494261808541696 2016-10-24 10:04:53 UTC <kathyfeller> @LZuni @bilalspeaks @SMCADMAN I would think so. Hopefully they'll do something about it. Very disgraceful, very bad.
790493496842956800 2016-10-24 10:01:50 UTC <kathyfeller> @bilalspeaks @rabiasquared @BilalSpeaks Yeah, the news reported KKK flyers being distributed a few weeks ago as well. Very bad stuff
790492932860030976 2016-10-24 09:59:36 UTC <kathyfeller> @LZuni @TorontoPolice @bilalspeaks @SMCADMAN Toronto is very far away. The news says the Abbotsford police are looking into this.
790464268294512640 2016-10-24 08:05:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @TheRealTeeMarie @WynnWygal Silly me. I only saw the headline and photo. Thought they'd appointed Linda Carter.
790460158946058240 2016-10-24 07:49:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @glynmoody @POLITICOEurope Did the previous government already agree? Or can this government say no before the signing?
790393495349407744 2016-10-23 03:24:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @ashmosley @deray No, but don't need to in Canada.
790388399865606144 2016-10-23 03:04:13 UTC <kathyfeller> @hughlaurie Congats! You deserve it.
790386003173253121 2016-10-23 02:54:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @owillis @BostonGlobe Isn't that a good thing?
790236157623738369 2016-10-23 16:59:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @_Rickii_ 40, but I've started another dozen or so.
789640468803923969 2016-10-21 01:32:13 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason You should look up and read the Fiji study about the influence of media/TV on young girls.
789640066406625280 2016-10-21 01:30:37 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason Definitely. There is a lot of crossover between Corp ads and state sponsored propaganda. Techniques, anyway
789639530798198784 2016-10-21 01:28:29 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason Just curious. Have you studied style and such in earlier centuries? Mine has been sketchy.
789638674111537152 2016-10-21 01:25:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason I'm not saying you're wrong, just giving you my perspective.
789638542683058177 2016-10-21 01:24:34 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason Make-up has been around for centuries. I've been ignoring the ads for decades, but the media glamour is what gets to me
789634266967646208 2016-10-21 01:07:34 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics nope, battle of Gettysburg much earlier and in a different state than the surrender
789627818254577664 2016-10-21 00:41:57 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason I tend to blame the entertainment industry more. If they didn't glorify make-up...
789627041154895872 2016-10-21 00:38:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason Which industry?
789137555455221761 2016-10-20 16:13:49 UTC <kathyfeller> @voxdotcom @binarybits @krogoff Wait. I understand abolishing big bills, but $20 bills are not big. Did you really say that?
789137297417474050 2016-10-20 16:12:47 UTC <kathyfeller> @mic @sarahmei Good article.
789132623947796480 2016-10-20 15:54:13 UTC <kathyfeller> @Chris_arnade @RajaKorman I live in Canada. Many of the people I know are religious and the rest believe that life has meaning.
788906697636978692 2016-10-19 00:56:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike The problem is - which country nationalizes a multi-national? But I think I understand what you want.
788633664598970368 2016-10-18 06:51:32 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh @Gabriel_G802 @costrike True in both cases. when I used to work in computers, page faults were typically caused by race conditions
788632855828131840 2016-10-18 06:48:19 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh @costrike Ian, is the "they" in your statement algorithms or people?
788632502202228736 2016-10-18 06:46:55 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh @Gabriel_G802 @costrike That's most likely a software error. The computer is following the instructions, they're just unexpected
788631794052718592 2016-10-18 06:44:06 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike @iwelsh @Gabriel_G802 Of course there is - it's just rare and usually due to electronical failure.
788602617714905088 2016-10-18 04:48:10 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike Maybe they set up one of those blocking things like hotels have done that restricts you to only their wi-fi locally.
788594002895437824 2016-10-18 04:13:56 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattyglesias I'm sure someone at your office could give you a quick summary.
788581280904417280 2016-10-18 03:23:23 UTC <kathyfeller> @Noahpinion Good article!
788480823859130368 2016-10-18 20:44:12 UTC <kathyfeller> @chrisalbon Yes, now if only my teenager agreed with that :)
788480538709340160 2016-10-18 20:43:04 UTC <kathyfeller> @Alexand3rTheMeh @ddayen Is there a mention of who might get that chair?
788394913834512385 2016-10-18 15:02:49 UTC <kathyfeller> @Medium @krogoff @wbuck456 I know that. I read the article in Medium and other reasons to keep cash were listed, but didn't see that one.
788263299515199488 2016-10-17 06:19:50 UTC <kathyfeller> @courtneymilan I didn't. mid-70s. South. Bible town. All closeted I'm sure. Although we thought this one English teacher was.
788226266876874752 2016-10-17 03:52:41 UTC <kathyfeller> @anniebellet Yep!
788225147039723520 2016-10-17 03:48:14 UTC <kathyfeller> @Spacekatgal @ParkerMolloy I am a parent. Completely inappropriate!!!
788100382501117953 2016-10-17 19:32:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @JulianMiller @pt I've seen a lot of discrimination justified by it not affecting business. I want to hear if Thiel is discriminatory or not
787925402878484480 2016-10-17 07:57:09 UTC <kathyfeller> @polotek @robwierzbowski @marshray I don't think it would be so big an issue if SV and VCs didn't have an existing diversity problem.
787922868721942528 2016-10-17 07:47:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @Medium @krogoff I didn't see you mention one reason to have cash is because some people have to use cash since they can't get bank accounts
787854070098694144 2016-10-16 03:13:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @SFGate Well, it was an ad agency. So...
787837835868905472 2016-10-16 02:09:12 UTC <kathyfeller> @Beorn1959 Oh, I was probably liking it for some other reason or misread it. Or, I realized what you meant later. Don't sweat it.
787829967056871424 2016-10-16 01:37:55 UTC <kathyfeller> @Beorn1959 I think you intended this response for someone else. And yes, I figured he'd misread your comment.
787784322669355009 2016-10-16 22:36:33 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Yeah, I watched him reason it out on Twitter. Was an interesting viewpoint.
787498286349365248 2016-10-15 03:39:57 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattyglesias @HankEpton The House ignores the will of the people all the time.
787484903617114112 2016-10-15 02:46:46 UTC <kathyfeller> @matthewstoller Well, I suspect that first number should be higher.
787473095527247873 2016-10-15 01:59:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @matthewstoller Well, that's not really surprising, is it?
787467740776759296 2016-10-15 01:38:34 UTC <kathyfeller> @RemOscuro That's understandable.
787464761411678209 2016-10-15 01:26:44 UTC <kathyfeller> @RemOscuro What is that?
787354844977692672 2016-10-15 18:09:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @DeanBaker13 Insurance rules, too - when Drs record a diagnosis on approved list in order to treat one that is not.
786788166132871169 2016-10-13 04:38:11 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics He wasn't wrong.
786726712730005504 2016-10-13 00:33:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @MickieMo @LI_Killdozer It has both. Pentagram 5 points. Jewish star 6 points.
786711853988622336 2016-10-13 23:34:57 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Can't be good.
786711327024611328 2016-10-13 23:32:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @owillis @Ali_Davis @XenoPhage Yes. One reason I was careful to say most. Definitely not implying all.
786666927104012288 2016-10-13 20:36:25 UTC <kathyfeller> @owillis @Ali_Davis Or they don't do that stuff so they just don't want to hear about it. 2/2
786666641127936000 2016-10-13 20:35:17 UTC <kathyfeller> @Ali_Davis @owillis My experience is that even telling most sympathetic men, they think you're being bitter and should just get over it. 1/2
786652510333210624 2016-10-13 19:39:08 UTC <kathyfeller> @JesselynRadack Just find out what they've already heard and fill in the gaps or misunderstandings.
786627244512845824 2016-10-13 17:58:44 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattyglesias @AStuttaford They're saying the packaging and plant equipment is non-UK, not the ingredients.
786620980135211008 2016-10-13 17:33:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @scalzi I remember one where the guy was discussing his client's financials (but not with client). You could hear him clearly 20 ft away.
786319240609402880 2016-10-12 21:34:50 UTC <kathyfeller> @538politics @OwlWithAGuitar @AmyDentata Yes, it is. Definitely agree. Also, seeing a lot men learning about it.
786305852261019648 2016-10-12 20:41:38 UTC <kathyfeller> @OwlWithAGuitar @AmyDentata @538politics I really don't understand why people find this so surprising. Been this way for decades.
786239623898902528 2016-10-12 16:18:28 UTC <kathyfeller> You might mention that today is a fast day as well.
786086949958328320 2016-10-11 06:11:48 UTC <kathyfeller> @LibyaLiberty yes
786056213054255104 2016-10-11 04:09:40 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @RemOscuro Canada has a vetting process. But I'm not sure why you mentioned cart blanc since I wasn't referring to the process
785911330645553152 2016-10-11 18:33:57 UTC <kathyfeller> @mmasnick @Beer__Wolf Well, he changed the wording first. From assault to conquest. So now he can claim he was talking about something else.
785903081384841216 2016-10-11 18:01:10 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Wait! What? Can we only take the ones that like immigrants?
785670763185442816 2016-10-10 02:38:01 UTC <kathyfeller> @Mobute @trekonomics @RollingStone Yes, that was good.
785620191459684352 2016-10-10 23:17:04 UTC <kathyfeller> @leighlahav Well, we moved TO Canada from the US. Not planning on going back.
785580685582970880 2016-10-10 20:40:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @Reuters Because some of us don't watch TV, but stream live events instead?
785551814049402881 2016-10-10 18:45:21 UTC <kathyfeller> @HealthScareSyst @DavidCornDC They also don't mention how it tied you to a job since the next job's insurance might not cover your family.
785353107014156288 2016-10-09 05:35:46 UTC <kathyfeller> @sheseauxsaditty @SheSeauxSaditty Kennedy assassination and Civil Rights Act.
784964680716431360 2016-10-08 03:52:18 UTC <kathyfeller> @donmelton @JMoVS if the electoral college votes are split enough, the house decides, 1 vote per state
783600720842850304 2016-10-05 09:32:25 UTC <kathyfeller> @Peter_Turchin you don't have an ebook version?
783555834194358273 2016-10-04 06:34:03 UTC <kathyfeller> @Spacekatgal This!
783534797452902402 2016-10-04 05:10:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @Chris_arnade Yes, but sometimes it a well spent 2 hours.
783530486350176257 2016-10-04 04:53:19 UTC <kathyfeller> @glennwsmith @ThunderJew1775 @joshtpm @thegarance If I n line for president, his diplomatic/civility style matters. Hope he gets coaching.
783523238127304705 2016-10-04 04:24:31 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike It seems not.
783515164582764544 2016-10-04 03:52:26 UTC <kathyfeller> @chrislhayes I think the VP choice is important.
783492541232533504 2016-10-04 02:22:33 UTC <kathyfeller> Okay, I don't like either VP candidate. They can't be civil or stay on subject. Neither of them look good to replace a president. #VPDebate
783489208409137152 2016-10-04 02:09:18 UTC <kathyfeller> I wish they would both be civil and would at least stay on the topic of the question. #VPDebate
782831183843368961 2016-10-02 06:34:33 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike @WPCollaborative  I bought the book today and am reading it.
782736032890429440 2016-10-02 00:16:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Sea Bees
782681553650393089 2016-10-02 20:39:58 UTC <kathyfeller> @paix120 Citibank is worse (or are they still around?)
782652330869035008 2016-10-02 18:43:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @TheNewThinker uh, do you have kids?
782475440384462848 2016-10-02 07:00:57 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike I agree with you on that.
782474053357404160 2016-10-01 06:55:26 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike Yes, but there's also a point where being able to control the toxicity in your feed is important. Balance and tradeoffs...
782465048308396032 2016-10-01 06:19:39 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike What do you mean?
782449445162000384 2016-10-01 05:17:39 UTC <kathyfeller> @nytimes @trekonomics Probably not. Is it worth a trillion misspent dollars?
781302048864161792 2016-09-28 01:18:18 UTC <kathyfeller> @TheNewThinker Way too many people already are.
781019584694452224 2016-09-27 06:35:54 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics yes, but last time we did that we pretty much stopped (mostly) the space program
781018787185295361 2016-09-27 06:32:44 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics yes, but some people need the romance of it to even get started on the idea (I don't mean musk) - so I figure it'll sort out...
781018065509216256 2016-09-27 06:29:52 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Read somewhere that treaty could be interpreted to mean no colonization. E.g.If humans considered contaminating.also who signed
776912614471323648 2016-09-16 22:36:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @red_boxer0 @mmasnick I've seen that somewhere. Check resources for game design (a ref that covers general games, not just computers)
776464522051629056 2016-09-15 16:55:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @matthewstoller Shouldn't he already know if it did?
776236907374141440 2016-09-14 01:51:15 UTC <kathyfeller> @Recode @karaswisher Are these cars designed to run 24x7? Constant wear. Think about home computers vs the cost of server quality.
772157925326368768 2016-09-03 19:42:50 UTC <kathyfeller> @amcafee @ahaspel @Noahpinion Some Middle East countries have tech, but not much progress on civil rights. Not sure tech improves culture.
772156240940048384 2016-09-03 19:36:08 UTC <kathyfeller> @RayneHall I like your flower pictures.
772155965990764544 2016-09-03 19:35:02 UTC <kathyfeller> @amcafee @ahaspel @Noahpinion okay, so only where there is tech progress that is spread to general populace and not just the elites?
772150943278256128 2016-09-03 19:15:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @amcafee @ahaspel @Noahpinion So you're not talking worldwide improvements, then?
772113464105897985 2016-09-03 16:46:09 UTC <kathyfeller> @deray Would they also work against sand fleas?
770839468911636480 2016-08-30 04:23:45 UTC <kathyfeller> @johnomeekins The video shows a date of Jan 1998.
770708287578738688 2016-08-30 19:42:29 UTC <kathyfeller> @amillerstrategy @Noahpinion Sorry, I meant report not result.
770708141885444096 2016-08-30 19:41:54 UTC <kathyfeller> @amillerstrategy @Noahpinion Does this result include upper management wages, stock options and bonuses?
770707428522418184 2016-08-30 19:39:04 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh That would be a good system.
769765718753632256 2016-08-27 05:17:03 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike if they're biological, they can get sick? Hope the researchers are thinking about that.
769754952075927554 2016-08-27 04:34:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @Robotbeat @trekonomics I like the elevator. And yes to some industry here. Was interesting that Bezos didn't want to colonize Mars
769747767073775616 2016-08-27 04:05:43 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @Robotbeat I saw both talks. Bezos wants to do space so we keep the planet for humans. Space for industry.
769048360200310785 2016-08-25 05:46:31 UTC <kathyfeller> @Spacekatgal That's one of my favorite things - wandering in a world.
769044756542451714 2016-08-25 05:32:12 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @TheAtlantic So how do they know that some other civilization didn't kickstart us?
769032706487443456 2016-08-25 04:44:19 UTC <kathyfeller> @VulgarEconomics @trekonomics @RemOscuro Nope. Is that a thing to do?
769029659199676416 2016-08-25 04:32:13 UTC <kathyfeller> @VulgarEconomics @trekonomics @RemOscuro But the first one was indoors although we don't do the door posts now.
769026144276451328 2016-08-25 04:18:15 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @VulgarEconomics @RemOscuro True
767835044958179328 2016-08-22 21:25:15 UTC <kathyfeller> @JYoolz @cr1901 You have a great bf!
767201393350352896 2016-08-20 03:27:20 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @VulgarEconomics well that's a pain, here we usually have to go into the city
767200894286827520 2016-08-20 03:25:21 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @VulgarEconomics ah, hard to find any at all here on the day of first night
767200142306881536 2016-08-20 03:22:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @VulgarEconomics some stores only stock the kosher for Passover matzah when it's closer to Pesach
766532011112542208 2016-08-19 07:07:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics yeah, I doubt I could read any of them now. But then I was starved for sci fi. I couldn't even watch Star Trek (parents :(
766531514922217473 2016-08-19 07:05:29 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics I loved Mike - my first AI. We did not have Foundation or Asimovs fiction in the library then.
766531018517950464 2016-08-19 07:03:30 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics you sure you're not thinking of Stanger in a Strange Land? that was the angry (and ridiculous) one
766530341704126464 2016-08-19 07:00:49 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics I was a teen when I read it. We didn't have a lot of science fiction in the library in those days.
766529281195245569 2016-08-18 06:56:36 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics Heinlein's best book was Moon is a Harsh Mistress altho I never read his later stuff.
766526985459806208 2016-08-18 06:47:29 UTC <kathyfeller> @jonahsilas You're welcome. And also thanks from me for the conversation and follow.
766526486681571328 2016-08-18 06:45:30 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason I suspect that for as many that do, there's an equal number invested in keeping the poor constrained with th existing system
766524919811158016 2016-08-18 06:39:16 UTC <kathyfeller> @appropedia @Grimeandreason @jonahsilas Great site, but haven't been keeping up with it.
766524209660989440 2016-08-18 06:36:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason @jonahsilas yes, Gaia will live. And humans, too, I believe. But if we don't change, there will be a lot fewer of us.
766523692482334720 2016-08-18 06:34:24 UTC <kathyfeller> @jonahsilas @Grimeandreason I have MANY hard copy books on food and basic industry, etc. The one part of my library I'm not making digital.
766523290319892480 2016-08-18 06:32:48 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason @jonahsilas That article reminded me of the mesh network. I wish that was working in my area.
766522429153746944 2016-08-18 06:29:23 UTC <kathyfeller> @jonahsilas @Grimeandreason I worry about Monsanto, et al - if the adaptable seeds get crowded out and we can no longer produce our seed...
766521913547984896 2016-08-18 06:27:20 UTC <kathyfeller> @jonahsilas @Grimeandreason I can see what you mean on adaptability.
766520686802182145 2016-08-18 06:22:27 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason Some developing countries aren't self sufficient because the West has mucked up their ability to do that.
766520083048869889 2016-08-18 06:20:03 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason But coastal areas will be a big problem, too. I haven't looked at the latest, tho.
766519842509758465 2016-08-18 06:19:06 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason We're all vulnerable, but maps I've seen show huge problem areas in Africa and South America because of the equator.
766467808871878656 2016-08-18 02:52:20 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics do you have a blog? I'm still reading your book, but would be interested in some of your political ideas, too
765783331963277313 2016-08-16 05:32:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @Jesselansner @trekonomics yes, but I like to ponder how ramifications of such things would change our world
765781755601248256 2016-08-16 05:26:12 UTC <kathyfeller> @Jesselansner @trekonomics this is not an idea I'd considered. Glad you tweeted about it
765779361484173316 2016-08-16 05:16:41 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @Jesselansner top 1% or top .1 %?
765776511135776768 2016-08-16 05:05:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @qz this idea ignores housing costs, local infrastructure, carbon footprint, and other stuff.
765440859697393664 2016-08-15 06:51:36 UTC <kathyfeller> @Slate @trekonomics your comment was fine, I do think the picture for the article was poorly chosen
765439656439652353 2016-08-15 06:46:49 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @Slate the article is well written and explains the good and bad
765290930555326464 2016-08-15 20:55:50 UTC <kathyfeller> @seangunn Torrance and Crenshaw (got rear ended there, but maybe it's changed now)
763945989904314368 2016-08-11 03:51:32 UTC <kathyfeller> @polotek @QUEcified Absolutely incredible!
763933643769155585 2016-08-11 03:02:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @trekonomics @thebafflermag  wow, that's going to be one huge crash when those people hit their biological limits
763243769965662209 2016-08-09 05:21:09 UTC <kathyfeller> @davies_will No, they just want people to stop telling them something they already know.
763241193379540992 2016-08-09 05:10:55 UTC <kathyfeller> @SecretService @Noahpinion @TheTigerTrainer yeah, it was pretty much "stop telling us, we know"
762887116535640064 2016-08-08 05:43:56 UTC <kathyfeller> @jasonhickel @costrike There's a lot of valuable (to society) "work" that society just won't pay for (or pay a living wage for).
762506731649798144 2016-08-07 04:32:26 UTC <kathyfeller> @leighlahav @BrianAcunis Yes, characters and acting was great! Script and editing, not so much.
758891077784866818 2016-07-28 05:05:07 UTC <kathyfeller> @anniebellet In my heart, you won!
758046870929219584 2016-07-26 21:10:32 UTC <kathyfeller> @DavidBrin @ExtremeTech It doesn't mention the lifespan of cells. Wouldn't that have an impact on implementation.
757790154434093056 2016-07-25 04:10:26 UTC <kathyfeller> @chrislhayes @jenbakos @allinwithchris The Cubs tweets are good, and I'm not even a Cubs fan.
757329028629958656 2016-07-24 21:38:05 UTC <kathyfeller> @MeredithClark Some places have better public transit than others
757320918322384896 2016-07-24 21:05:51 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike Found that site this year. But no ballets for 2 elections and now we're dual citizens so not sure if we care (it's a blue state).
757318719647264768 2016-07-24 20:57:07 UTC <kathyfeller> @costrike technically, we get to vote for Federal elections from the state we lived in. So far, we haven't gotten ballots - did try to get
757099412006907904 2016-07-23 06:25:40 UTC <kathyfeller> @anniebellet Me, too. It's a great motivator to walk.
752651815372500992 2016-07-11 23:52:31 UTC <kathyfeller> @NateSilver538 So are you saying that just because my outlook is good, I shouldn't care about others with worse outlooks?
752647028904071168 2016-07-11 23:33:29 UTC <kathyfeller> @wilw Great article!
752357033093963776 2016-07-10 04:21:09 UTC <kathyfeller> @Grimeandreason Yes, about 14 years ago. We emigrated.
752310040250363904 2016-07-10 01:14:25 UTC <kathyfeller> @Mishyana @FreddieDeboer There are virtues for maturity, but what does either have to do with this game?
752305328205672448 2016-07-10 00:55:42 UTC <kathyfeller> @MeredithClark Hi!
752057177481682945 2016-07-10 08:29:38 UTC <kathyfeller> @iwelsh You're writing a book?
752016987480395776 2016-07-09 05:49:56 UTC <kathyfeller> @Reuters @sumohulksmash Ah, thanks for the clarification. I was probably too upset to notice when I watched it.
752014947375128576 2016-07-09 05:41:49 UTC <kathyfeller> @Reuters Wasn't Castile on the passenger side? Why does the lawyer refer to the actions of the driver?
751627305923977216 2016-07-08 04:01:28 UTC <kathyfeller> @JohnMetta @rjhopjr Excellent article (I, Racist).
750846887910006784 2016-07-06 00:20:22 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattyglesias @Miz_Rosenberg I remember watching JFK's funeral procession on TV and the adults all being very, very upset.
748940514452393984 2016-07-01 18:05:07 UTC <kathyfeller> @mattyglesias @cdmcmahon That's 350 million per week.
747260129087623168 2016-06-26 02:47:52 UTC <kathyfeller> @JasonAntrosio Didn't realize a different person wrote the article. I don't normally comment on blogs, but I did this time.
747254620716556288 2016-06-26 02:25:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @JasonAntrosio Very good article!
747241232082960384 2016-06-26 01:32:47 UTC <kathyfeller> @mikelevine @DukeRiley @vincentdonofrio Not available in Canada
747026112832634882 2016-06-26 11:17:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @Paul_Bettany Anyone who voted Leave and didn't expect this wasn't paying attention.
746375846584193024 2016-06-24 16:14:03 UTC <kathyfeller> @BlakeBooks So true. It's too bad the media doesn't report this.
746038392467521538 2016-06-23 17:53:08 UTC <kathyfeller> @mmasnick @pacanukeha I'm pretty sure FB wants you to stay on FB and not go to the news site.
744914614211608577 2016-06-20 15:27:38 UTC <kathyfeller> @anniebellet Yes, you do!
743536118423916544 2016-06-16 20:09:59 UTC <kathyfeller> @Peter_Turchin @SeshatDatabank Are you questioning what is an infographic or why one would be useful?
739989388193464320 2016-06-06 01:16:33 UTC <kathyfeller> @charlesjkenny @BillGates How is this different than Plagues and Peoples by William McNeill?
