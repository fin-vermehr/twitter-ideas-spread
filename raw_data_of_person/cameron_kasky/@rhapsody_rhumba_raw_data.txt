967060918751449088 2018-02-23 15:37:44 UTC <rhapsody_rhumba> @realDonaldTrump Fake potus.  Fake words.  Needed a cheat sheet to express concern for the survivors a mass shooting.   Bought and paid for by the NRA.  #resign
967060125256167424 2018-02-23 15:34:35 UTC <rhapsody_rhumba> @realDonaldTrump  Yours days are numbered, 45.  Gates and Manafort expected to flip.  Why would they choose life in prison over loyalty to a grifter?  Do something admirable for once in your vile existence.  #resign

965406723157692417 2018-02-18 02:04:33 UTC <rhapsody_rhumba> @realDonaldTrump And you're laughing with Putin as you refuse to enforce the sanctions against him.   #trumpisafuckingtraitor #TraitorTrump #IMPEACH
965392188837376001 2018-02-18 01:06:48 UTC <rhapsody_rhumba> @realDonaldTrump Resignation is always an option.  All that money laundering for all those years is a little tough to cover up.  Take your fake family and hit the road, crook.
965390082701189122 2018-02-18 00:58:26 UTC <rhapsody_rhumba> @realDonaldTrump Just a matter of time, 45.  Might be wise to resign before the money-laundering comes out.  Whodda thunk becoming potus would be the thing that lands you in prison?  Bwhahahahahaha
