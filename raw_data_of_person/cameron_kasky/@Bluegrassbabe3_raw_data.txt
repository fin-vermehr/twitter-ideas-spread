You dont have to agree or insist that you are right/they are wrong. A basic tenet of life...you learn by listening. Open your ears & your heart. See what happens.

967095418839584770 2018-02-23 17:54:50 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @kweenkengrie Exactly! Thats what my husband says, a gun owner since his youth. NO CIVILIAN needs a weapon intended for military use. Its freaking common sense!

966886314825080832 2018-02-22 04:03:55 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five Exactly. We are stuck; no one can listen to an opposing view or even grasp the concept of compromise. The only thought is, I must win the argument! Sad, troubling days.
966880739957460994 2018-02-22 03:41:46 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> As Americans, weve become very good at assigning blame instead of fixing problems. Troublesome.

965393254547116032 2018-02-18 01:11:02 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @JatikaSpeaks The teens are already heads above the pussy hats movement. Why? Theyve stated its non-political. It doesnt appear to be a hissy fit over an election or rights they might lose. These kids are fighting for their lives! Huge difference.

965378885490757641 2018-02-18 00:13:56 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @rmayemsinger The U.S. Constitution is the oldest written constitution still in use today. Do some scholarly research on its origins. It will be enlightening.

962541114166272001 2018-02-10 04:17:39 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @lexi5983 I think the original poster missed my sarcasm. The Rock is obese according to his BMI! Do you think hes not into fitness?  I agree. We are who we are. If we are healthy & feel good, does it matter? So sick of everyone being a fitness guru.

959936762834497537 2018-02-03 23:48:53 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @lexi5983 Agreed. Those who follow leaders and/or their political party blindly without questions are the ones who frighten me. I thought it was an interesting article.

958171632362835969 2018-01-29 02:54:53 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @sarahkliff Interesting. I have Anthem. I live in KY. Never had a problem with ER visits. Her coverage & this...the health plan uses both diagnostic codes as well as medical records in their review process is the key. Glad she got it sorted.

958156793485590529 2018-01-29 01:55:55 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five Honestly? I havent had a tax break in years. Any type of financial break. So, for once, something to benefit me!  Its apparently broken down monthly on my statement so I need to calculate the entire break. Seriously thrilled.
958152575714504704 2018-01-29 01:39:10 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> And my health insurance premium only increased $9.00. Im...flabbergasted.pic.twitter.com/ShHsIumg9E
958152343652110336 2018-01-29 01:38:14 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Is the tax bill in effect? Because my retirement teachers income is fixed & I am paying less in federal taxes it appears. My goodness. I never get a break.  Ill take it.

950211276701040640 2018-01-07 03:43:17 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @lexi5983 And that was an inspired speech. I think you were looking at your 2020 Dem candidate for POTUS. 
950210971259277312 2018-01-07 03:42:04 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @lexi5983 I was (still, kinda, sorta) an Oprah fan UNTIL her lavish 50th bday bashes & her scolding of her audience after Hurricane Katrina. You should open your home to refugees, she said. Did she open any of hers?  I do admire most of her charitable efforts.
950204758312275968 2018-01-07 03:17:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Is this Oprahs kickoff for 2020? Impressive.  #GoldenGlobes

948975670528528385 2018-01-04 17:53:25 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @OriginalFunko @lkplushies I understand that. I meant...what system do they use to select the winner? From a lottery of RTers?

915968286948544512 2017-10-05 15:53:52 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @LogophileFille @jasonsfolly I highly doubt we will resolve any serious issue here on Twitter. Have a blessed day!

915784502219337728 2017-10-04 03:43:34 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @LogophileFille @jasonsfolly Ok. Not going down the Russia path but I do agree we have issues with women in charge. Good night. Blessings to you.
915784090493833216 2017-10-04 03:41:56 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @LogophileFille @jasonsfolly As do I. Thus, my unhappiness with the entire political atmosphere. I advocate for a sustainable third and/or fourth major political party. And common sense people who are willing to reach workable compromises. Its governance. We need it.
915782260833574912 2017-10-04 03:34:40 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @LogophileFille @jasonsfolly The bigger question to me is WHY did they vote for him? Thats the heart of the political problem. He ran a horrible campaign. Was Sec. Clinton that poor of a candidate? Again, Dem leadership better seriously re-group.
915780656336134144 2017-10-04 03:28:17 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @michele5411 Its about pure evil. Why does every horrific, violent act have to be associated with mental illness? Some people are just evil. Bottom line.
915779587153580032 2017-10-04 03:24:02 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @LogophileFille @jasonsfolly Serious problems are for serious people. Ive been a clean slate voter for several years now. If you are an incumbent from either party? Im against you. Past time to shake it up politically.
915779117307613184 2017-10-04 03:22:10 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @LogophileFille @jasonsfolly Not. American. Ah, yes. I see.  That stat is horrifying; no one can dispute that. What IS the solution? The Democratic Party best be getting serious about 2018. Some new leadership is sorely needed.

910704605536899072 2017-09-20 03:17:52 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @funder @BillBushman Either of the two major political parties had a sincere interest in helping any of us or had any concerte policies in mind. Its all chatter
910704085115994112 2017-09-20 03:15:48 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @funder @BillBushman I see. The Democratic Party is the party of the people...no millionaires, no self-serving agendas, perfect. Interesting. I wasnt certain...
910687511105736704 2017-09-20 02:09:57 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @BillBushman @funder And the Democratic policy is? 
910544676368846855 2017-09-20 16:42:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch 
910544188562972673 2017-09-20 16:40:26 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> My mind is saying, Get busy! Be productive today! My body is disagreeing. Blerg.

910515474001211397 2017-09-20 14:46:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @HerculesHandy Joking, right?  No. Why would I leave the man I love?
910274154859032576 2017-09-19 22:47:25 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five @purpleglitter81 Very different. Im off to church; Ill have to play tonight. Later! 
910272519432806401 2017-09-19 22:40:55 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 @2five Everything looks SO BIG. 
910272417804808193 2017-09-19 22:40:31 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 @2five I did. Its updated. I dont like it. 
910251729224175617 2017-09-19 21:18:18 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 @2five I usually do...after much complaining.  I don't think I have it yet? There's no notification on my phone. Thanks for letting me know!
910250875939115013 2017-09-19 21:14:55 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 @2five Which will probably screw up my phone. I'll update though. *sigh*
910249329159475203 2017-09-19 21:08:46 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 @2five Booo. Hate updates.

910201822559776769 2017-09-19 17:59:59 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @bagelynch Glad to read you are better. Continue resting. 
910201493730549760 2017-09-19 17:58:41 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @bagelynch @MarlaLynch He's supposed to.  He knows immediately (his tongue starts to burn) if he's ingested. He shies away from anything questionable.
910201027407810560 2017-09-19 17:56:50 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @bagelynch @MarlaLynch The cross contamination is odd though. Someone must have used a knife with mayo residue still on it to cut the watermelon?
910183666898362370 2017-09-19 16:47:51 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @bagelynch @MarlaLynch And that is odd. 
910183479241003009 2017-09-19 16:47:06 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @bagelynch @MarlaLynch Really? She's allergic to mayo?  My son is potentially fatally allergic to peanuts/peanut butter. Cross contamination is scary.

909957019641167872 2017-09-18 01:47:14 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five I thought the politics was low-key but yes. Middle America is sick of having the liberal agenda crammed down their throat at every turn.
909956564957704192 2017-09-18 01:45:25 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five When Twitter was fun & carefree! I miss those days.

903818644215406592 2017-09-01 03:15:31 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five No. Not watched that show in a long time. I think it's too much Game of Thrones.
903817514462965761 2017-09-01 03:11:02 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five I don't think I've ever had one during a short nap. There was a person who turned into a zombie in the hubs sunroom.

903810327552413696 2017-09-01 02:42:28 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Cathymarie55 I think that's in the article? I didn't know it was because of a bad break-up.

900781334959927296 2017-08-24 18:06:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @jandimmock2 I loved her so much. She was a wonderful person. She was deeply hurt by many b/c of her work. I hope they regret their cruelty to her.

880436641302802433 2017-06-29 14:43:47 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Twitter @LatoyaBembry They won't block him. I've repeatedly reported an abusive "nobody" account & nothing has been done. No way will they take on POTUS.

879829284726214657 2017-06-27 22:30:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @steph_simmons88 @Cathymarie55 True.
879816947986300933 2017-06-27 21:41:21 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @steph_simmons88 @Cathymarie55 And I changed gyno's. She's fantastic but I had driven an hour & a half for her to deny me? After I burst into tears, I saw her NP.
879815715037085698 2017-06-27 21:36:27 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @steph_simmons88 @Cathymarie55 Exactly. I rarely have a long wait though, regardless of the doctor. So that's good.

756216533274296320 2016-07-21 19:57:26 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @THR That should appeal to the common man.

754795754246602752 2016-07-17 21:51:45 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @wwwbigbaldhead There you go. Please & thank you are the magic words. 
754788670981476352 2016-07-17 21:23:37 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @wwwbigbaldhead I think a mass text went out to your #TWD cast mates. Very supportive of you; very nice of them. 
754775429882445824 2016-07-17 20:31:00 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @TWDRickGrimes__ He's SO gray. I love it. 
754775174231298048 2016-07-17 20:29:59 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @nobleday Perhaps it should be. He's got six months left in office. Speak his convictions & let the chips fall where they may.
754764784151699457 2016-07-17 19:48:42 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @buffyfan145 Ha! It's interesting. Hope to catch another epi tonight. Hopefully, earlier so I won't be scared. 
754761681767628801 2016-07-17 19:36:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @IrishAssKicker @jandimmock2 I still see it. Some are more obvious than others.
754760933034094592 2016-07-17 19:33:23 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> What's he gonna say? The same thoughts, prayers, we are with you? We have a problem? I'd like to see him come out raging!  @POTUS
754760077123477504 2016-07-17 19:29:59 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @IrishAssKicker True! 
754759370001506304 2016-07-17 19:27:11 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @IrishAssKicker Thank you. When I say that, people say I'm subtweeting them.  Maybe they will listen to you. 
754757870231650304 2016-07-17 19:21:13 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @LatoyaBembry I've been thinking the same thing...

754682709386166272 2016-07-17 14:22:33 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @SunnyParker I miss it too! 
754682444805206016 2016-07-17 14:21:30 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @buffyfan145 It scared me.  I watched it very late & I was anxious.  It was interesting though. Really thought "the girl" was a boy. 
754681969485676544 2016-07-17 14:19:37 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Blessed Sunday, everyone! 
754557089754779648 2016-07-16 06:03:23 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Mikeylito I meant I just watched the first epi. Enjoy! I'll have to take it an epi a night I think.

747521666411008000 2016-06-27 20:07:08 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch Thanks, Marla.  All is well until I hear differently. #Positivity 
747521129296859136 2016-06-27 20:05:00 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @joshwolfcomedy Whatever happened to listening & compromising?! It's apparently a lost, common sense art.
747520868646068224 2016-06-27 20:03:58 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @joshwolfcomedy We're so politically correct & obtuse. Grow up, America. When we embrace our differences, we can then learn & compromise.

745023963558969344 2016-06-20 22:42:09 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> And the "new" Tommy account has blocked me.   My memory may be spotty in other matters but never doubt my knowledge RE: #SouthLAnd.

744739005007339521 2016-06-19 03:49:50 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @PhantomWhovian I'm lost. All good though. I think.

744721165403426817 2016-06-19 02:38:56 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @tntdrama And double dang...you stopped following @Cudlitz?! I don't matter but that's cold.  Yes, I just scrolled thru all you follow.
744713595850735616 2016-06-19 02:08:52 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @tntdrama Dang. I lost your follow somewhere along the way?  And after all these years. Since #SouthLAnd, 2009.

739894217145765888 2016-06-06 18:58:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @PhantomWhovian Not a Kevin fan. Like him more this season though. Honestly...I don't know why I watch. Not a fan of any of them! 
739890082937737222 2016-06-06 18:41:56 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @PhantomWhovian She seems perfect when things are going perfectly. She knows this family, what they are like. Nothing should surprise her.
739851804352073728 2016-06-06 16:09:50 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @PhantomWhovian And I despise John's wife. We really know little about her but she seems a "holier than thou" type. 
739850915360956416 2016-06-06 16:06:18 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @PhantomWhovian Your tender heart.  Glad you are enjoying the show. 
739811626937942020 2016-06-06 13:30:11 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @buffyfan145 :D I've read it's a good show. Unusual but good. Yes, I've been told Arse's story as well.
739809169964969984 2016-06-06 13:20:25 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @PhantomWhovian His wack mom will screw him up.  So...you're on S2?
739808993305038848 2016-06-06 13:19:43 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @PhantomWhovian Danny is no angel. Yes, his family did him wrong BUT ppl can overcome. Too emotionally scared I guess. Nolan will be fine.
739803831421292544 2016-06-06 12:59:12 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @PhantomWhovian I'm re-watching S1.

726953206262169600 2016-05-01 01:55:25 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> I think it's called jumping the shark?  #GameofThrones (Who knows with this show though...)
726944687978860544 2016-05-01 01:21:34 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five Agreed.
726944077623775232 2016-05-01 01:19:08 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five He doesn't like docs but he d/n like being sick either. He's too busy!  I think he'll go.
726943658914754566 2016-05-01 01:17:28 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 @2five Ha! I didn't until a while ago. 
726942560539840512 2016-05-01 01:13:07 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five I tried to get him to go to Urgent Care today (we have one surprisingly) but he refused. Family doc tomorrow I hope!  Resting = good
726941298196893696 2016-05-01 01:08:06 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five I think strep throat. His throat looks decent though  he's very symptomatic. You have been busy! Time to rest.

726624381808562177 2016-04-30 04:08:47 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @THR Very inappropriate. In NO context or situation is that acceptable. None. To anyone, especially not to the POTUS.

726537245449175040 2016-04-30 22:22:32 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Edfarnham @jandimmock2 I always thought he was though. Could not be happier for his success.

726147663444451328 2016-04-29 20:34:28 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Edfarnham @jandimmock2 It is. The pics are great but very costly. They could allow more than a few seconds. I did get to smooch Josh tho.
726146887791857664 2016-04-29 20:31:23 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Edfarnham @jandimmock2 Nope. And rushed you are. A con (can't remember the name now) w/Josh was the only one that wasn't too hurried.
726146420676411392 2016-04-29 20:29:32 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> And even more free media coverage for Trump! Face it, media outlets. He's got y'all in his pocket. https://twitter.com/johnpaczkowski/status/726142493616562176

725123584662839296 2016-04-26 00:45:09 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch @raushenbush The media slings the term "evangelical" around far too loosely IMO.

722972579787620352 2016-04-20 02:17:49 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five @purpleglitter81 I'll keep plugging along with it. Think I'm on epi 3 or 4. Hope Tweetbot corrects itself.
722971818554994688 2016-04-20 02:14:48 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @lexi5983 Spoiler! Kidding...I stopped watching after S1. 
722970452398858240 2016-04-20 02:09:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five @purpleglitter81 Some old one w/Nicole Kidman. I've been disappointed in S2 Kimmy. Other than Titus, it's boring. 
722969307983032320 2016-04-20 02:04:49 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five @purpleglitter81 Glad y'all are good.  I'm ok. Watching a dumb movie. 
722969021163929601 2016-04-20 02:03:41 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five I read that in an article here on Twitter. Exactly. As I said, she can be replaced. 
722967912517128192 2016-04-20 01:59:17 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five @purpleglitter81 
722967658216435712 2016-04-20 01:58:16 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five Agreed.
722967547281326080 2016-04-20 01:57:50 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five @purpleglitter81 Exactly. Quite the diva IMO. Who is worth $20 MILLION for talking?!

722942320178503680 2016-04-20 00:17:35 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 I just lost interest. It is weird about Michael leaving & Kelly is apparently angry. 
722942036379348993 2016-04-20 00:16:27 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 Isn't that Memorial Day weekend?  I always have company.

722600364273442816 2016-04-19 01:38:46 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @BeschlossDC Hmmm.
722591305331777536 2016-04-19 01:02:46 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @BeschlossDC The SECOND the polls closed. Sheesh. We knew it was a given but a minute of suspense would've been nice!
722590895711895552 2016-04-19 01:01:09 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> The polls JUST closed @CNN  #NYPrimary
722579141317554176 2016-04-19 00:14:26 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @lexi5983 Mercy.

722578169870557185 2016-04-19 00:10:35 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Sher_is_Fierce We scream bloody murder!  Yes, most of the political system needs to be evaluated & overhauled.
722577881642242048 2016-04-19 00:09:26 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Sher_is_Fierce Well, that blows & is entirely ILLEGAL if they are properly registered. We don't have those shenanigans here in KY.

722575287570034688 2016-04-19 23:59:08 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Sher_is_Fierce I don't understand how it's broken. Surely voters in NY knew their state has a closed primary?  They chose to ignore it.

722242077292175360 2016-04-18 01:55:04 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @SunnyParker Apparently.  Ha! 
722237868396122113 2016-04-18 01:38:21 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @SunnyParker I only read the comics when Michael came on as Abraham; wanted to know his back story. I prefer the show. 
722237455018147841 2016-04-18 01:36:42 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @SunnyParker I've just blocked 2 people who hatefully chastised me for not liking comic Rick. I give two  about comic Rick!

722225088758738944 2016-04-18 00:47:34 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five For a few minutes anyway. Waiting to watch Better Call Saul finale tonight. Ok is good.

710714946779291648 2016-03-17 06:30:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five I know! I'm tempted to re-watch. Possibly season one.

710519428765581313 2016-03-17 17:33:27 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Adele will help me power through this day.  That emotion...I've never felt it from any other singer besides Linda Ronstadt.

709925810334003204 2016-03-15 02:14:37 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> He did not even mention Gov. Kasich.    I don't understand anything anymore.   #SuperTuesday
709925396108726274 2016-03-15 02:12:58 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> He's right.  https://twitter.com/benhowe/status/704863353882148864
709922664270471169 2016-03-15 02:02:07 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Sher_is_Fierce @MarkRuffalo He seems like such a passionate, genuine person. Kudos to all. 
709922424507211776 2016-03-15 02:01:10 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Congratulate, Gov. Kasich, @realDonaldTrump!
709922030297157632 2016-03-15 01:59:36 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Sher_is_Fierce Amen! 
709921513068175360 2016-03-15 01:57:33 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Sher_is_Fierce Answered prayers! So thankful. Continued prayers for a successful transplant.
709920856177295360 2016-03-15 01:54:56 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Sher_is_Fierce So a donor has been found? Awesome! 
709903864770732033 2016-03-15 00:47:25 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Phew! Thank you, OH!  #SuperTuesday
709902926903435265 2016-03-15 00:43:41 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 @2five Ah, ok.  I see other tweets complaining about it. I need to check out Instagram.
709902464024256512 2016-03-15 00:41:51 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch I know. He's highly aggravated with his beloved Republican Party. 
709902183278518273 2016-03-15 00:40:44 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MinnesotaBen Oh, wow! I may have to subscribe. Thanks.

709900162848722944 2016-03-15 00:32:42 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch @steph_simmons88 I just had the one & I can't remember that far back. 
709899935576096768 2016-03-15 00:31:48 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 @2five No, I'm not sure. 
709899813500887040 2016-03-15 00:31:19 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @steph_simmons88 @MarlaLynch Perhaps the wee one is just going to be the quiet. :) I'm sure all is well. Wee babe will be jumping soon. 
709899498735149057 2016-03-15 00:30:04 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch That's because you have a good heart. 
709899332321939456 2016-03-15 00:29:24 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @steph_simmons88 That. Exactly.
709899275564617728 2016-03-15 00:29:11 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @smittenkitten4d @SmittenKitten4D Blocking here is a joke. Good luck with this. Things like this I take seriously & I hope Twitter resolves it. Xo

709897532940427268 2016-03-15 00:22:15 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @BeschlossDC Dropping out.
709897300672389121 2016-03-15 00:21:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch @steph_simmons88 Wait? What? I'm butting in. Sorry. Concerned.
709897109969965056 2016-03-15 00:20:34 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @smittenkitten4d @SmittenKitten4D It's not normal. I'm not even a big fan of the parody accounts unless they stay completely in character.

709889903807569921 2016-03-15 23:51:56 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 @2five This person stalks the celeb; just tweets stuff to try to get a reply. It's sad. And annoying.  I've muted.

709839739587788800 2016-03-15 20:32:36 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @pianist247 Very fair observation.

708603409218277380 2016-03-12 10:39:52 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Mikeylito I did! There's a couple of so-so epis in the middle then it hits it's season one stride again. Enjoy. :)

708475615758909440 2016-03-11 02:12:04 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33  I think folding laundry & doing dishes are calling my name. Always something. 
708472321066078208 2016-03-11 01:58:58 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33 It's great exercise! Glad you are going back, staying healthy.  Yeah, I need to get busy or switch to something else. 
708471319332057088 2016-03-11 01:54:59 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33 Boxing? Cool.  I'm ok. Watching this Trump mess on TV. 
708470400037097473 2016-03-11 01:51:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33  How's the beautiful Jules tonight?
708457681523249152 2016-03-11 01:00:48 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @McBlondeLand Possibly. 
708455274592526336 2016-03-11 00:51:14 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> I didn't go to kindergarten but my parents taught me this. And I agree. https://twitter.com/marlalynch/status/708454774832635906
708454054997925888 2016-03-11 00:46:23 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch Hmmm. Thanks for the info.
708452748950372352 2016-03-11 00:41:12 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Trump canceled his rally in Chicago due to protesters. Getting dicey. Getting. Dicey.
708452082962046976 2016-03-11 00:38:33 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch What did Hillary say?
708448537164570624 2016-03-11 00:24:28 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Toastburglar 
708448444797624320 2016-03-11 00:24:06 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @justanactor There's a lot of "NOTICE ME!" You've figured that out I'm sure.  I hope you are not aggravated too much. Bless.
708447499032399872 2016-03-11 00:20:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Toastburglar I'm trying to figure out how to entertain you.  I fail. I'm hungry.

708375835808546816 2016-03-11 19:35:34 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> If you ever get the chance to visit the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, take it. 
708373944710078465 2016-03-11 19:28:04 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Cudlitz She's too sweet, that Delilah. Let her do her thing. 
708372095575715840 2016-03-11 19:20:43 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> I'm  watching Mrs. Reagan's funeral. Mercy. *sigh*

708329461402509313 2016-03-11 16:31:18 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @ben_mckenzie Congrats, poppa. Let the spoiling begin.  So happy for you & your family. 
708185890229620740 2016-03-10 07:00:48 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Oh, #HouseOfCards...you do know how to do it right.  #FU2016  (Two more to go! )
708142184386658304 2016-03-10 04:07:08 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @marcorubio None of us children hold political office but...we have been successful in life.
708140765571059712 2016-03-10 04:01:29 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Same goes for you @tedcruz #GOPDebate
708140652085846017 2016-03-10 04:01:02 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> We get it, @marcorubio. Your parents were poor. So were mine. They were self-made hard workers as well & left their 3 children better off.
708139794627432448 2016-03-10 03:57:38 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch @steph_simmons88 @julesm33 SWEET! 
708136906278752256 2016-03-10 03:46:09 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Probably too little, too late, Mr. Rubio. #GOPDebate
708136545337925632 2016-03-10 03:44:43 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @KateOH That's what my sis says as well.
708135098449862656 2016-03-10 03:38:58 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Kasich is correct. #GOPDebate
708134462295556096 2016-03-10 03:36:26 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Trump is ill or exhausted. He's exhibiting too much malaise & his voice is hoarse. #GOPDebate
708131719145267201 2016-03-10 03:25:32 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> But now, Teddy, in all fairness...President Carter already had that deal in place. #GOPDebate
708130585999511553 2016-03-10 03:21:02 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> I already cast my #GOP vote for the primaries. Why am I watching?  #GOPDebate

708125121077256192 2016-03-10 02:59:19 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 @2five Watching the GOP debate & eating chips.
708119303518867462 2016-03-10 02:36:12 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @kentucker @DanaBashCNN @CNN But it didn't work. Praise be!
708119079601762304 2016-03-10 02:35:19 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @smittenkitten4d @SmittenKitten4D He has none so far. 
708118329685360641 2016-03-10 02:32:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @smittenkitten4d @SmittenKitten4D Indeed. The son (20's) is not paying in anything. We are opening him a Roth IRA next year &  for the best.
708117133461426178 2016-03-10 02:27:35 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @smittenkitten4d @SmittenKitten4D I never paid enough in; all mine is through KY retired teachers. I know. It's doomed I fear. 
708116834403393536 2016-03-10 02:26:24 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Yes. Someone talk about re-defining entitlements & CUTTING some expenditures. #GOPDebate
708116510426980353 2016-03-10 02:25:06 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Only people who have never done a hard day's work in their life want to raise the retirement age.  #GOPDebate
708115554993881088 2016-03-10 02:21:19 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Am I the only one who knows that CONGRESS makes the laws?!  #GOPDebate
708115199950233604 2016-03-10 02:19:54 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Bingo! Secretary of Education. Knew some deal had been made. @RealBenCarson @realDonaldTrump #GOPDebate
708111425705738240 2016-03-10 02:04:54 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> One thing about Trump...he stays on his message of no message. #GOPDebate

708102382291435520 2016-03-10 01:28:58 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Or I may finish watching Hunger Games: Mockingjay 2.  Same thing. #GOPDebate
708102057060900864 2016-03-10 01:27:40 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @andersoncooper has such a crush on Trump. It's palpable. Probably friends off camera.  #GOPDebate
708101547822030848 2016-03-10 01:25:39 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> I'm going to watch this upcoming train wreck. You know who is profiting from this circus? Cable news. No one else. #GOPDebate

706909769521569792 2016-03-07 18:29:57 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Ah, Peyton Manning is crying on my TV.  (I don't follow football but this is touching.)
706909273784238084 2016-03-07 18:27:59 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five Hang on.  I'm on six, maybe? Interesting as only HOC can be interesting.

706576279601078272 2016-03-06 20:24:47 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33 I read a brief synopsis. You may need those tissues.  And Hershel (& others) are the reason I read them!

706391583889997824 2016-03-06 08:10:52 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five It was ok. Hope yours was good as well. 
706391468068491264 2016-03-06 08:10:24 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five For KY? Rand Paul. So he could run to keep his Senate seat AND President. 
706347169079496708 2016-03-05 05:14:23 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Invisible_EM I know. 
706338779133517824 2016-03-05 04:41:02 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @JustinThomas97 All the way to the end. That respect for his teacher. I think he called him "Walt" once the entire series.
706322165956747264 2016-03-05 03:35:01 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> The KY caucus vote is NOT representative of the state. Thank you @RandPaul for disenfranchising ur constituents. May is soon; we'll remember
706321563914805250 2016-03-05 03:32:38 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Invisible_EM Ha!  He has that effect on people. So happy for you.
706315533000515585 2016-03-05 03:08:40 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Oh, just keep on waiting @CNN  They are probably drinking mint juleps or taking whiskey shots instead of counting ballots.  #SuperSaturday

706224932863217665 2016-03-05 21:08:39 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> I'm going to caucus.  We've NEVER caucused in KY. Thxs to self-serving Rand Paul, today we R's do. This will disenfranchise many. Politics.
706221730742849537 2016-03-05 20:55:56 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @kgroob @WLWT The taxpayers, of course. I blame Rand Paul.

706206993934106624 2016-03-05 19:57:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @carefree1777 We've not gone yet; waiting on hubs. We won't. There's been very little info on it & few in my tiny county embrace change.
706206572666601473 2016-03-05 19:55:42 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @carefree1777 @OMGFacts I never understood the appeal. 
706204443180703745 2016-03-05 19:47:14 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @OMGFacts I agree. I never saw the appeal except that the cast was "pretty people."

705600763440054272 2016-03-03 03:48:26 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @steph_simmons88 Someone said Rubio did have a cold. I honesty don't know how any of them keep their energy going.
705592060338958337 2016-03-03 03:13:51 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch What is the solution then? Again, Twitter is too limited to discuss much.
705591244538388480 2016-03-03 03:10:36 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five Yep. I think Claire left Frank? Or was going to?
705590856347156480 2016-03-03 03:09:04 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 I'm two or three epis behind.  It's been ok so far.
705590639921127425 2016-03-03 03:08:12 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch Amongst many other pressing ones.
705590387554045952 2016-03-03 03:07:12 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five Hmmm. Probably. Or shortly there after. I need to watch the last epi of the previous season.
705590074470178818 2016-03-03 03:05:57 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> My TV automatically turned to the recording of #Colony I take that as a sign. 
705589697523875840 2016-03-03 03:04:27 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five Thanks. Hang in there! 
705589598420865025 2016-03-03 03:04:04 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch All of adulthood should be easier.
705589493345206272 2016-03-03 03:03:39 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch You may not get to attend a "prestigious" college/university but you can go. And it is your debt to pay. It should be easier.
705589245663166464 2016-03-03 03:02:40 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch The hubs & I paid for our son's education. What he did not get in scholarships. Scholarships, grants, etc ARE out there.
705588269791232000 2016-03-03 02:58:47 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> When did student loans become an issue? I have an AB & MA & worked my tail off to pay for my education. It's called adulthood. #GOPDebate
705587157331795969 2016-03-03 02:54:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five Better. You?
705585480830685184 2016-03-03 02:47:42 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @GunnerGale I question this.

705526293044043776 2016-03-03 22:52:30 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33 And  about the job abusing your body.
705526058464968704 2016-03-03 22:51:35 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33 I've stood on concrete my entire working life.  No, it doesn't. If I lay on my back it doesn't hurt, always when on either side.
705522483382906880 2016-03-03 22:37:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33 I'm falling apart, Jules. Falling apart! Trying to nap. I can't for the knee pain. pic.twitter.com/6w0cmTv4XP

705467507612774400 2016-03-03 18:58:55 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33 Better...but a dry socket is starting. (I think ) So back to surgeon tomorrow. How's your day going?

705252005867077632 2016-03-02 04:42:35 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> The truth very often hurts but it will stand when the world is on fire. And that preaches...

705232784491675648 2016-03-02 03:26:13 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five I wish you were too. 
705232693647286274 2016-03-02 03:25:51 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @WalkrStalkrCon Does Showclix have an app? For scanning tickets? Its a big effort for me to access a workable printer. Thanks.
705231118015012864 2016-03-02 03:19:35 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five Yes. I read the story & the mom's efforts to get Adele there. I  Adele. I'm honestly going to just sit & cry if I make her concert.
705230736895426560 2016-03-02 03:18:04 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch I second this!

705218982509461504 2016-03-02 02:31:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @BeschlossDC Truly, a lion in winter. Have you visited The Hermitage? Fascinating.
705214683742138368 2016-03-02 02:14:17 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> All the tears & prayers for this wee one. God bless you, Adele. https://twitter.com/tracygibney/status/704723205748072449

704860989053902852 2016-03-01 02:48:50 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Mikeylito I've been preaching that for years. Where are the independents?!

704860111685230592 2016-03-01 02:45:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Cudlitz Remember when I said Trump would drop out after the second debate? Color. Me. Wrong. And scared & befuddled.

704798682781245441 2016-03-01 22:41:15 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Edfarnham @Cudlitz It's fantastic. A staple. I think I need to donate some to a food pantry in Michael's honor. 
704798161911607297 2016-03-01 22:39:10 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Cudlitz A new thing at all WSC's? This would really help out local food pantries & shelters. Dialogue doing good work! #Bisquick #TWD

701933236168081408 2016-02-22 00:54:59 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @BillBushman Word.
701933133705453569 2016-02-22 00:54:35 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Watching #Richonne. Again. I like it. Makes sense.  Plus, Rick's been eyeing that booty since S3.  #TheWalkingDead
701932390567043073 2016-02-22 00:51:37 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @BillBushman They won't cause it's what you said...followers. 
701932249160269824 2016-02-22 00:51:04 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @BillBushman Parody accts are fine, if they stick to parody. Most I've seen do not. So geez, get a separate personal acct.
701931919081132032 2016-02-22 00:49:45 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @keep__smyelin @MSpals I'm told that as well. "You look good." Thanks but you should see my insides. 
701931581766823936 2016-02-22 00:48:25 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MustStopMS @MSpals It's not fatal. Debilitating but not fatal.
701931344792784901 2016-02-22 00:47:28 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @BillBushman That.
701924220733886465 2016-02-22 00:19:10 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MustStopMS @MSpals My neuro says water aerobics or stationary bike.
701922213553950721 2016-02-22 00:11:11 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @sheepandstars They seem to be symptomatic of MS.
701921319613550594 2016-02-22 00:07:38 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @keep__smyelin @MSpals Deb. Overwhelming fatigue at the moment.

701570714567049216 2016-02-21 00:54:27 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @ceili It did seem odd, I agree.
701569007913140224 2016-02-21 00:47:40 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @ceili It probably doesn't. I just took Wahlberg for a liberal Democrat...so I was surprised.

699767631478444033 2016-02-16 01:29:39 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MikeAFairbanks Try is the key word. I don't buy that BS of, "I didn't know. I found it online." Then say...I found it online. 
699767209497853952 2016-02-16 01:27:58 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MikeAFairbanks My bro was a pro photographer; I guess why it infuriates me. How long does it take 2credit someone? A few keystrokes or taps
699766538119864320 2016-02-16 01:25:18 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MikeAFairbanks It pisses them off. The ones who take AMC's pics & slap their names/logos on them WILL get caught someday. I've warned them.
699766219898019842 2016-02-16 01:24:02 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MikeAFairbanks I'm not even a photographer & I keep trying to tell people. I've pointed out yours often to others if you remember.

699441675157032961 2016-02-15 03:54:25 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @GloriaLTadaro I watched her again. She looks back about 3 times at the piano player; they both know s/t is wrong. And her voice does crack.
699439813095788544 2016-02-15 03:47:01 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five @purpleglitter81 I'm too tired to regular dance so I chair danced. LOVE the blues.

699433341767065600 2016-02-15 03:21:18 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @abigail_bel No. The Grammys & now that I've missed part of it I don't want to tune in.

699430408799305728 2016-02-15 03:09:38 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @GloriaLTadaro I think she was very emotional. Plus, there was something up w/the sound. Some weird something chimed in there besides piano.
699429973413773312 2016-02-15 03:07:55 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> That is how it's done, singers. She has no equals. None. #Adele #Grammys
699429550992789504 2016-02-15 03:06:14 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five @purpleglitter81 At first. An odd something in between as well.
699429299720491009 2016-02-15 03:05:14 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> That was a spiritual experience.   #Adele #Grammys

697633167600193536 2016-02-10 04:08:03 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @ReginaKing @AmericanCrimeTV   Stunning storytelling. Groundbreaking I believe.
697631255857340417 2016-02-10 04:00:27 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> This cast is one of the most phenomenal on TV. If you're not watching, tune in! Catch up online. @AmericanCrimeTV #AmericanCrime

697622937017434112 2016-02-10 03:27:24 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five I've been very agitated.  I don't know if it's the weather, worry or what. Anyway. How's your day been?

697585170224955392 2016-02-10 00:57:19 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33 I'm pretty excited too! 
697583527932645376 2016-02-10 00:50:48 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @smittenkitten4d @SmittenKitten4D Thanks. It is what it is.
697581489404452864 2016-02-10 00:42:42 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @smittenkitten4d @SmittenKitten4D Definitely. Instead of camaraderie, 1 of my fandoms has become a mean girl's club. Cliques. Exclusion. I'm an outsider.
697580366090076161 2016-02-10 00:38:14 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @carefree1777 Same. I do this often as well but it would be a great Lent activity. :)
697579277366259712 2016-02-10 00:33:54 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @smittenkitten4d @SmittenKitten4D Sad, isn't it? I think you've been here awhile like myself. Twitter's dynamic has really changed the last few years.

697578215792123904 2016-02-10 00:29:41 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @smittenkitten4d @SmittenKitten4D  I'd love to but it's not worth the grief anymore.
697577781291524099 2016-02-10 00:27:58 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Edfarnham I remember that scene. Ha! ;) Lta!

697572502332112896 2016-02-10 00:06:59 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33 Plus, the spoilers could be wrong. 
697572380487643136 2016-02-10 00:06:30 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @julesm33 Reading them & then actually seeing it play out are two different things to me. I like to be prepared. 
697566677765124101 2016-02-10 23:43:50 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @BillBushman @cudlitzbeard Agreed. Only two people alive know who is behind that acct. And, nope. It's not me.

693965924618104832 2016-01-31 01:15:44 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 He's playing the guitar.
693965817667555328 2016-01-31 01:15:18 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 Who was that singing last?! LOVE. HIM! 
693965216489590785 2016-01-31 01:12:55 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @2five @purpleglitter81 He's dull. No sexuality, no swagger.
693964326026219520 2016-01-31 01:09:23 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @WarmTV The sound is a problem. I've got the TV volume cranked!

693964084216209408 2016-01-31 01:08:25 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 Never heard of him. Julianne is doing great. As is the rest of the cast. Guess I'm too attached to Travolta in that role.
693962413549428736 2016-01-31 01:01:47 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Yep. No Travolta. Sorry whoever you are playing Danny. #GreaseLive
693961416148172801 2016-01-31 00:57:49 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @msrandcc Looked like it.
693960540222275585 2016-01-31 00:54:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Bring back the live variety show! Take the hint, networks! https://twitter.com/comedy_girl/status/693959919775670272
693957664099942400 2016-01-31 00:42:54 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @WarmTV @kyool Travolta was electric! The original Grease slayed; all of it. The corniness, subtle humor, performances, music, etc.

692898916421898242 2016-01-28 02:35:49 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Why does Rubio talk so fast?  #GOPDebate

692869523414712320 2016-01-28 00:39:01 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Common sense wise, a flat SALES TAX is the most fair. Just saying. #GOPDebate

692804234870419456 2016-01-28 20:19:35 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @lcwilli1 I think so too! 
692804169787400195 2016-01-28 20:19:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @lcwilli1 He's so traumatized. I keep defending him. 
692788943117492229 2016-01-28 19:18:50 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @lcwilli1 He *should* know better though. Baby Judith even does.  But that's all she's ever known.

692787736114270209 2016-01-28 19:14:02 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @lcwilli1  I'd have to re-watch. Did anyone actually tell him to be quiet?  His mom told him to pretend to be brave, etc. But quiet?

691487438867415041 2016-01-24 05:07:07 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MScubed @Calbear95 I will. :)
691487110684110848 2016-01-24 05:05:49 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Calbear95 @MScubed If it persists, I'm going to have to. Thanks, ladies. Appreciate the advice. 
691486918656315393 2016-01-24 05:05:03 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Calbear95 @MScubed No, nothing in particular.
691486846946299904 2016-01-24 05:04:46 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MScubed @Calbear95 It seems too.
691485536138194944 2016-01-24 04:59:33 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Calbear95 @MScubed Every day this past week or so. Getting worse every day.
691485342537498624 2016-01-24 04:58:47 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MScubed @Calbear95 That's what I'm wondering. Thinking just a bad knee. Plus, some swelling in R hand. Never had that B4 but I can stand it
691484569380462592 2016-01-24 04:55:43 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MScubed @Calbear95 Mainly around my knee. I'm blaming it on overexertion.
691484381349810176 2016-01-24 04:54:58 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Calbear95 Thanks.

691483675494584321 2016-01-24 04:52:10 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MScubed  Scroll up? I just asked @Calbear95 Thanks. :)
691483226007846913 2016-01-24 04:50:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Calbear95 @nobleday Or do you think it's something else?
691483142893469696 2016-01-24 04:50:03 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Calbear95 @nobleday Ok. When tired, leg drop has now developed into leg pain, though only at night when I lay down. Terrible pain. Common?
691482621893873664 2016-01-24 04:47:58 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Calbear95 @nobleday The FB group?
691482467245670404 2016-01-24 04:47:21 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Calbear95 @nobleday Any of the regulars around have RRMS? I think I only follow you & Nancy. Oh, & @MScubed.
691482060184272896 2016-01-24 04:45:44 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @nobleday @Calbear95 Well, crap. I looked at your bios; neither of you have PPMS. Sorry. 
691481765408546817 2016-01-24 04:44:34 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @nobleday @Calbear95 Do you both have PPMS? Who on here has RRMS? Thanks. I have a leg question involving pain. 
691459060466651136 2016-01-24 03:14:21 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch I'm sorry. Same here. I'm in bed. Come on in.

691021836621062145 2016-01-23 22:16:59 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @GinaW1127 Word!
691021764575522816 2016-01-23 22:16:41 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch This is true.  I think I'm being screenshot & DMs are flying about. Ppl have far more energy than me.
691021410207162369 2016-01-23 22:15:17 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @GinaW1127 The same is happening to you?! Mercy. Remember when Twitter followed/unfollowed ppl on its own? Weird. 
691021061421453312 2016-01-23 22:13:54 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch Ah, the RTs. That could be it. Smart lady.

691020533371109376 2016-01-23 22:11:48 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> Weird, weird day. You never cease to amaze, Twitter. #staylively #keepsthebloodpumping 
691019958428553216 2016-01-23 22:09:31 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> How does someone who you have blocked & your account is set to private get access to your tweets?  Makes me question our mutual followers.
691018432255516674 2016-01-23 22:03:27 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @jandimmock2 @Cudlitz And, agreed. We all have bigger real life concerns. All my best to you. Xx
691018131867897856 2016-01-23 22:02:15 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @jandimmock2 @Cudlitz And I never said you said anything wrong. I was expressing my concerns & opinions, as were you. Hope all remains well.
691016099568164865 2016-01-23 21:54:11 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @RenHanami Have fun! 
691015896442277888 2016-01-23 21:53:22 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @carefree1777 I know! That baby smell is heaven. 
691014332474343425 2016-01-23 21:47:09 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Sis1961S Thanks! He is beautiful. 
691014234914816000 2016-01-23 21:46:46 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @GinaW1127 I know! She's coming home tomorrow but I'm snowed in.  Hope to meet him soon. 
691009698577915904 2016-01-23 21:28:45 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @nobleday Precious. Can't wait to hold him. 
691009438774358018 2016-01-23 21:27:43 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch Or a 30 second rule. I correct myself. 
691009187187392512 2016-01-23 21:26:43 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @Edfarnham Thanks! Lta. 
691009074960408576 2016-01-23 21:26:16 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @nobleday Two days old. A snow baby. 
691005092519100416 2016-01-23 21:10:26 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @purpleglitter81 He's a beauty! She's been sending me pics. Can't wait to get my hands on him!

691003555008880646 2016-01-23 21:04:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @MarlaLynch Thanks! I'm ridiculous.  I had to trim part of it. Apparently, Twitter has a 20 sec rule on vids. 
691003092062568448 2016-01-23 21:02:30 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @jandimmock2 @Cudlitz ...my observations & concerns. Be well. And again, enjoy the Con. You'll be overwhelmed w/his generosity.
691002709886001152 2016-01-23 21:00:58 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @jandimmock2 @Cudlitz Obviously, he tweets who he wants. As is his right. I tweet w/no expectation of a reply. All good. Just expressing..
691002364224999424 2016-01-23 20:59:36 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @jandimmock2 @Cudlitz It seems that way. I see many tweets directed 2him that are complaints the "loyal" are not getting enough attention.
690989302587723776 2016-01-23 20:07:42 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @cupcakespoetry Exactly!
690988600171872256 2016-01-23 20:04:54 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @jandimmock2 @Cudlitz But what do I know? There are some here who seem to know him far better than me. Enjoy the Con. 
690985184552960001 2016-01-23 19:51:20 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @jandimmock2 @Cudlitz No offense meant to you. Your feelings are yours. It hurts me to see people gang up on him.
690984038895632384 2016-01-23 19:46:47 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @jandimmock2 @Cudlitz If people don't stop passively/aggressively tweeting him, I imagine he'll stop tweeting period, like Josh. Plain talk.
690983557427302400 2016-01-23 19:44:52 UTC <Bluegrassbabe3> @jandimmock2 @Cudlitz I'm not downhearted with him. I was follower number 200 something! He's ALWAYS been amazing 2 fans. Always.
