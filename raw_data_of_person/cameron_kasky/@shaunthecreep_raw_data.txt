962055095826268164 2018-02-09 20:06:23 UTC <shaunthecreep> @FourFourTweet @karthikgooner Best is highly subjective. Depends on a particular moment in time. For example United hasnt been the best over the past 4 seasons but still is one of the biggest.

957130586069454849 2018-01-26 05:58:09 UTC <shaunthecreep> @kp221289 Dei bravo and Faf arent the same forces. I mean I appreciate CSK for the unknown Indians they brought through. Mohit Sharma, Gony in the first two seasons, tyagi, Badrinath etc etc
957130012917776384 2018-01-26 05:55:52 UTC <shaunthecreep> @kp221289 Umm remind me. Who is R Ashwin playing for again? =p
957129830343979008 2018-01-26 05:55:08 UTC <shaunthecreep> 10 years of IPL and the onion prices are still high. I bid 40 iNR for 1 Kg if onions .
957127440517623808 2018-01-26 05:45:39 UTC <shaunthecreep> The IPL auction shows the ruthlessness of corporate culture unfortunately. How can one establish fan base when the core of players that glorified the franchises are no longer in the squad. Should take a leaf out of the footballing culture.
