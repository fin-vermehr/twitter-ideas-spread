972121076464484354 2018-03-09 14:45:00 UTC <Moogeebear> @crehage Absolutely! Theres got to be a better balance here. That behavior is socially destructive and counterintuitive to peace.
972119306317254656 2018-03-09 14:37:58 UTC <Moogeebear> @crehage Thank you! True! She just retweeted my response. She felt it was an attack on her intellect? Not. I just feel she is being defensive and because of that she is not recognizing people who validate and support her. She must be fun to hang with. 
972116741793964032 2018-03-09 14:27:46 UTC <Moogeebear> @Femmefeministe @crehage I thought it was supportive. This is a case of damned if you do, damned if you dont.

972103418406952960 2018-03-09 13:34:50 UTC <Moogeebear> @lexforchange @samdonath @dbqschools This is the mentality you are educating. Your website stated that your board doesnt discriminate, yet your Hempstead student does when he trolls survivors of a mass shooting. He needs mental help.pic.twitter.com/bhBbgLdBAA

972075302192058368 2018-03-09 11:43:06 UTC <Moogeebear> @lexforchange It is how unintelligent, small men, attempt to minimize a woman that they are afraid of. Keep rocking the boat. They have gotten too comfortable with their misogyny.
971926861617029121 2018-03-08 01:53:15 UTC <Moogeebear> @lexforchange I have children and totally support you!!! I get it!!! 
971879980501291008 2018-03-08 22:46:58 UTC <Moogeebear> @BrittanyFurlan Violence isnt the answer. Tommy was not a good role model and you are only 10 years older than his son. The picture is all wrong. You are star struck. Get out before you are next. Seriously. Writing on the wall. Toxic guy. You can do better.
971854664386871296 2018-03-08 21:06:22 UTC <Moogeebear> @DLoesch @lexforchange I do everyday. I cant stand Dana, what she stands for or how condescending and patronizing she is. Heart of rock. She is easily swayed and regurgitates nonsense she has been brainwashed with. She didnt finish college and has this job because of her husband.

971729803513606145 2018-03-08 12:50:13 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump Protect and build steel and aluminum while destroying and killing wildlife for fun. Yeh, you would look forward to that.
971726226447654913 2018-03-08 12:36:00 UTC <Moogeebear> @nytimes I hate this administration. This is wrong. He does not care about anything, but instant gratification. Giant man baby.

971541300263694336 2018-03-07 00:21:11 UTC <Moogeebear> @MrTommyLand Nobody deserves, that is a want versus need mentality. I personally challenge you to stay clean for a whole year. Can you do it? Do you care enough about YOU and your family/friends to? Its work. I would love to see you succeed.

971408079622418432 2018-03-07 15:31:48 UTC <Moogeebear> @TMZ @MrTommyLand @WayneAnthonyHo7 I disagree with a portion of that statement. Does anyone have good reason to hit someone? His son learned from his dad: http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/21/local/me-51994
971407690609188865 2018-03-07 15:30:15 UTC <Moogeebear> @TMZ @MrTommyLand If he did what you said he learned it from YOU. http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/21/local/me-51994
971407166493089792 2018-03-07 15:28:11 UTC <Moogeebear> @TMZ @MrTommyLand @sassymomma76 Maybe he should stop posting pics of his blown up lip on social media to shame his son and remember when he went to jail for beating up a Pamela Anderson. Air your dirty laundry & ppl comment. Its pretty simple. Maybe needs to delete his acct til hes clean.
971406354970628097 2018-03-07 15:24:57 UTC <Moogeebear> @TMZ @MrTommyLand @BizballMaury @steinbaby1 @666josefina I think Tommy needs help. Nikki got it together and I could not be happier for him. Tommy stagnated and needs mental help.
971406007627931648 2018-03-07 15:23:34 UTC <Moogeebear> @TMZ @MrTommyLand @BizballMaury @666josefina He deleted a bunch of tweets. He says hes real? Real hypocrite. Remember when he went to jail for beating Pamela up? He did it in front of his children. On record with police. I am sure he baited his son and is now playing victim.
971398113058590722 2018-03-07 14:52:12 UTC <Moogeebear> @andrewbrodie331 Yet another Trump dysfunction... only they have a legal pill for that. If he lived elsewhere, I know of a state that could assist him with another pill and wed all be out of our misery.
971209358922141696 2018-03-06 02:22:10 UTC <Moogeebear> Is Trump just some kind of weird psychological experiment on the world? I keep waiting for someone to pop out and Dr. Phil us all.
971203378863894528 2018-03-06 01:58:24 UTC <Moogeebear> @delaneytarr @CharlotteAlter It means you are doing all of the right things and they are so terrified that is all that they can resort to doing. Hysterical!!! We are with you!
971175931879583744 2018-03-06 00:09:20 UTC <Moogeebear> @dgoins @MrTommyLand The truth is that you have had such a violent past. You went to jail for beating up Pamela. You are calling someone a jackass when they make sense because you stagnated emotionally and your frame of reference is conflict not stability. You can do better!
971169168899936258 2018-03-06 23:42:27 UTC <Moogeebear> @MrTommyLand @josephspano7 Thats the problem. He has an abusive father. Where do you think he learned it? Remember when he went to jail for beating up Pamela?

971157681988947974 2018-03-06 22:56:49 UTC <Moogeebear> @SeanAstin @BBartilotta See and what is ironic is you are proud of the attention that you just got from Sean blocking you. Pathetic Trumper.
971156681878065152 2018-03-06 22:52:50 UTC <Moogeebear> @BuzzFeed @ThePerezHilton @kellyparker_79 Truth. His opinions formed from his own personal observations. I have never seen him be mean.. ever.

970729102046097417 2018-03-05 18:33:47 UTC <Moogeebear> @DLoesch @davidhogg111 @lauren_hoggs Its because she is paid to spread propaganda. She is dropped out of college and was hired because she is pretty, can read a TelePrompter, gets coached and swayed easily. These are paranoid gun owners; they feel threatened by teens. No more assault weapons.
970724594691854336 2018-03-05 18:15:53 UTC <Moogeebear> @DLoesch @NRATV @Fr3derick82 Such bullsh*t propaganda. Paranoid much? It is so scary to see such paranoid gun owners!

She was paid for because of her measurements, not intellect and because she looks good in front of the camera. She has no brain and is completely scripted. She is what is wrong with America and encouraging discourse.

970306735381667841 2018-03-04 14:35:27 UTC <Moogeebear> @PerezHilton @florriccio It had to take momentum where people said enough is enough. It took Parkland-very strong, intelligent teens; they are the change. This was cumulative and it is for everyone ever affected by shootings and not here due to these tragedies.

969292896921948161 2018-03-01 19:26:49 UTC <Moogeebear> @CaseyCagle Did you bend over for the NRA today?
969270557618339840 2018-03-01 17:58:03 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump @syedmahmood @Greeneyesvzla72 These are kids. Do you realize that you are cyber assaulting children who have lived through a massacre at their high school? They watched friends die. You are a cyber bully and nobody takes you seriously.
969178829632819200 2018-03-01 11:53:34 UTC <Moogeebear> @jk_rowling There is true inspiration there! Also, a little exercise 
968950458659328006 2018-02-28 20:46:06 UTC <Moogeebear> @CaseyCagle @fred_guttenberg I am so sorry Fred. My heart hurts for you. You have all of my support. Cagle is an prime example of what is wrong and what is not working in this country.
968818127286005760 2018-02-28 12:00:15 UTC <Moogeebear> @PerezHilton You tell her to go away, but for the love of humanity, could you please give her a makeover? I think her anger stems from there. I could be wrong, but really, the rest of us would be ever so grateful!!!
968637609093337090 2018-02-27 00:02:57 UTC <Moogeebear> @TheDoctors You seriously blurred the penis? Is there a penis? I would hope so... I mean it better not be like a giant Ken doll. A little reality would be great.
968636889715617792 2018-02-27 00:00:05 UTC <Moogeebear> My response: They are happy to be alive. They are celebrating life, not death. Stop being a troll. They are not letting their classmates die in vain. What... would you rather that they throw themselves into their classmates graves to make YOU happy????pic.twitter.com/QStiAKoLcA
968581356979654656 2018-02-27 20:19:25 UTC <Moogeebear> @BetteMidler I have. He gets a daily check in with me. How can people like this live with themselves?
968580789486186496 2018-02-27 20:17:10 UTC <Moogeebear> @BGCCAN @BoysGirlsClubGA @CaseyCagle Did you tell them what a weeny you are and how you are threatening @Delta ? Did you mention that you love the NRA and would rather see the boys and girls die so that you dont lose NRA perks? Blood money speaks for you doesnt it?
968579989015851010 2018-02-27 20:13:59 UTC <Moogeebear> @BetteMidler I think that they bend over and shoot it out of a different orifice.
968579465646432257 2018-02-27 20:11:54 UTC <Moogeebear> @CollinRugg They are happy to be alive. They are celebrating life, not death. Stop being a troll. They are not letting their classmates die in vain. What... would you rather that they throw themselves into their classmates graves to make YOU happy????
968579446855950336 2018-02-27 20:11:50 UTC <Moogeebear> @CollinRugg You know whats weird? Trolling high school kids. You know what else is weird? Trying to strip them of their humanity.
968569336377077761 2018-02-27 19:31:39 UTC <Moogeebear> @davidhogg111 Remain strong. Youve got this. People are saying nasty things. Ignore them. There will always be trolls. You are smart, courageous, strong, energetic and so much more! Ignore haters. You have more good ppl in your corner!!!
968552773963911168 2018-02-27 18:25:50 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump Can someone please throw water on him?

968497841864929280 2018-02-27 14:47:33 UTC <Moogeebear> @NRA @njgrl Exactly. I have been wondering the same thing. Makes no sense.
968444930619314176 2018-02-27 11:17:18 UTC <Moogeebear> Changing how I do things. @FedEx .... blood money.... NRA puppet corporation.https://twitter.com/4_the_babies/status/968322302625681409
968236949340385282 2018-02-26 21:30:52 UTC <Moogeebear> @ThePerezHilton Although in Marks defense... I think he would have tried so it isnt a fair comparison.
968232398600237063 2018-02-26 21:12:47 UTC <Moogeebear> @mcspocky @reensjp The whole family is gross
968226040484163584 2018-02-26 20:47:31 UTC <Moogeebear> Daughter died of kidney disease. Sad, but makes me wonder what he roofied her drinks with.https://twitter.com/ap/status/968221488863240192
968221857529892865 2018-02-26 20:30:54 UTC <Moogeebear> @Emma4Change @davidhogg111   He needs to get voted out! @CaseyCagle thinks guns are more important than people!!!!https://twitter.com/caseycagle/status/968199605803454465
968219544530583553 2018-02-26 20:21:42 UTC <Moogeebear> @CaseyCagle Supporting the NRA because they pay for you? Transparent. KILLER!!!
968219329497051136 2018-02-26 20:20:51 UTC <Moogeebear> @CaseyCagle Casey has blood on his hands
968218913568907273 2018-02-26 20:19:12 UTC <Moogeebear> @NRA @Delta @CaseyCagle You have blood on your hands. You are why people are dead Casey. Casey, you are so gone.
968218637789270017 2018-02-26 20:18:06 UTC <Moogeebear> @NRA @Delta @CaseyCagle Paid for by the NRA
968218519816032256 2018-02-26 20:17:38 UTC <Moogeebear> @NRA @Delta @CaseyCagle You are a tool
968218249392467968 2018-02-26 20:16:33 UTC <Moogeebear> So the government is threatening a corporation? @CaseyCagle Get the out of office. @Delta With you!!https://twitter.com/thehill/status/968211336244203522
968185474161561600 2018-02-26 18:06:19 UTC <Moogeebear> @njgrl You are surprised? Look who is in the WH. You know why.... it is just to unbelievable to completely comprehend though.
968133037304221696 2018-02-26 14:37:57 UTC <Moogeebear> @scottderrickson Awesome. What jerks.
968132213958217729 2018-02-26 14:34:41 UTC <Moogeebear> @amazon @NRATV @FedEx @davidhogg111 That is a great idea. If Amazon doesnt get with it, I will cancel prime and delete my app so I dont use them. Already stopped using FedEx.
968094462722363392 2018-02-26 12:04:40 UTC <Moogeebear> @marcorubio @NRA F*ck the NRA. F*ck  Rubio if he takes more blood money. Dirty politicians.
968093068967727104 2018-02-26 11:59:08 UTC <Moogeebear> @FedEx I have 3 packages going out, but not using FedEx today or any other day until you cut ties with the NRA. This is going to add up. People want change. Will you be with us? #BoycottFedEx
967949161910894592 2018-02-25 02:27:18 UTC <Moogeebear> @amazon I am not buying thru you ( I do almost daily), until you stop supporting the NRA.
967948016513683457 2018-02-25 02:22:45 UTC <Moogeebear> @FedEx I will no longer use your services until you break ties with the NRA.
967947410923315200 2018-02-25 02:20:21 UTC <Moogeebear> @FedEx please stop supporting the NRA.
967861204663357441 2018-02-25 20:37:47 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie Minnie, get your vitamin D level checked. Its a huge factor with immunity and Deficiency makes you more susceptible to the flu.
967859979968548864 2018-02-25 20:32:55 UTC <Moogeebear> @Emma4Change @davidhogg111 You are our future. You are the voices of a new generation. I wish mine could have done it for you, but too many are blind. I support and applaud you. You are everything that is right with this country. 
967857114940170240 2018-02-25 20:21:32 UTC <Moogeebear> @DLoesch Its wrong to say about your kids, but you are a POS and people hate you. Its because of what you stand for.
967781875422060544 2018-02-25 15:22:34 UTC <Moogeebear> @SpeakerRyan These kids are our future. Your time is over. This generation is out of touch. Gun control is needed.
966032839807590400 2018-02-20 19:32:31 UTC <Moogeebear> @jumpFloofs I am so glad this was not what I thought it would be!
966031223792467969 2018-02-20 19:26:06 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ I hate that
964275981799313408 2018-02-15 23:11:24 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump Your prayers are as good as your hair.
956885898779676672 2018-01-26 13:45:51 UTC <Moogeebear> @3Brigids You are nice! My snake filled head wishes him death.
956885628335067137 2018-01-26 13:44:46 UTC <Moogeebear> @officecandy Omfg FTW! 
948642552047132672 2018-01-03 19:49:43 UTC <Moogeebear> @zachbraff Does anyone else have nuclear button envy or is it just me?
943141006719049728 2017-12-19 15:28:33 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ Dying!!!!
943125875746258944 2017-12-19 14:28:25 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ We did it though!!! Even though there was so much study this, this and this ( nevermind the fact that it wont be on the final)! 
943125554496143360 2017-12-19 14:27:09 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ It was so freaking obscure overall! What a rough final!!!
942917291624271873 2017-12-18 00:39:35 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ Omg EXACTLY!!!!
942893686316290049 2017-12-18 23:05:47 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ So, if you were in France and had 1.37 lbs of grapes ( convert to g ) and you squished them and extracted the juice to get the density of the solid Ag in the cylinder how many carbs would there be? Show me the carboxylic formula and then reduce it. Do it now!
942829375078260737 2017-12-18 18:50:14 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump Says the guy who wants to waste money building a wall, but yes agreed that our infrastructure needs attention.
942811313411158016 2017-12-18 17:38:28 UTC <Moogeebear> @crehage @areosen 
942807809477042176 2017-12-18 17:24:32 UTC <Moogeebear> @MiraSorvino @tribelaw Agreed. So heartbreaking! I left that business years ago ( made a big mark in background work ).... so many horrible things people tried during that time. All of these stories hit me so hard. I love Mira!
942806765263032322 2017-12-18 17:20:23 UTC <Moogeebear> @njgrl Whats up?
942806615425679363 2017-12-18 17:19:48 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 And I  see that you are a big man baby. If you dont agree with someone you stick your fingers in your ear and LA LA LA at the top of your lungs. Poor man baby needs to mute people because he cant handle what they say. Ex soldier/police current wimp
942777093716369408 2017-12-18 15:22:29 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 I did read it and you are coming across like a Pussy grabber, but hey thats not as bad as rape.
942774137176682497 2017-12-18 15:10:44 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 Then what the hell are you not understanding? You went after me like a fool yet we are essentially saying the same thing only you want to acknowledge varying degrees like they matter. They dont. Its either RIGHT or WRONG. No degree (although acknowledged) is acceptable. Asshat
942768265776033792 2017-12-18 14:47:25 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @PerezHilton She is brilliant.
942766084154904576 2017-12-18 14:38:44 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 Math. 5+5=10. In this equation 10 = good behavior or desirable actions. Anything else is incorrect although other numbers have varying degrees. Anything else is still wrong no matter what the action is if not consensual.
942762275714330624 2017-12-18 14:23:36 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 Wiggle room of varying degrees apparently confuses predators. Saying all of these actions across the board will not be tolerated is the discussion.
942761751669600257 2017-12-18 14:21:31 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 They are by far not the same actions, but all fall under the category of WRONG which means just dont do it and there will not be an issue. Shading it makes excuses. Black and White... wrong or right and people will have no confusion. Period.
942750727495135232 2017-12-18 13:37:43 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 Wrong across the board. If people just realized that and Did an excuse it or justify it by degrees it might actually stop. Saying oh its not that bad because of X, Y, and Z just gives an excuse to the perpetrator.
942750308542894080 2017-12-18 13:36:03 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 Agree, but still wrong and that is the point. It goes into the dont do column to avoid all of the shades of confusions and excuses people seem to come up with for Deplorable behavior.
942749747177238529 2017-12-18 13:33:49 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 Breaking in a house is wrong even if stealing 1 thing or clearing it out. Still wrong. It means DO NOT DO IT. The degree is of no consequence. Know right from wrong. Elementary and basic.... remedial really if u cant understand.
942592526736875520 2017-12-17 03:09:05 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 The behavior is wrong on any level. All of the behavior that falls under the umbrella of NO.  On any level THAT behavior is wrong.
942570337170087936 2017-12-17 01:40:55 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @DexterMorgan70 The point is that on any level it is wrong. Period.
942568938206048258 2017-12-17 01:35:21 UTC <Moogeebear> @driverminnie @GlebeShore They are unwanted behaviors. Not the same, but definitely under the umbrella of NOT Wanted and DO NOT DO. All of it needs to end.
942531915013337089 2017-12-17 23:08:14 UTC <Moogeebear> @people @elrond70 She probably is, but it does not make her wrong.
942531635668451329 2017-12-17 23:07:07 UTC <Moogeebear> @people @Chriscub2334 Easy to discard as such, but there is a much bigger truth here.
942526481468715009 2017-12-17 22:46:39 UTC <Moogeebear> @MiraSorvino Your future still holds amazing things and your best work! Youve got this girl!
942525387443195904 2017-12-17 22:42:18 UTC <Moogeebear> @Andy @AshleyJudd @driverminnie 2/2 I also know that was beside the point. He was just a pig and would have tried to work you. Tears strong ones down first... once demoralized he could play his game.
942524766598107137 2017-12-17 22:39:50 UTC <Moogeebear> @Andy @AshleyJudd @driverminnie I cannot imagine anyone else in that role. I think AJ is a fab actress, but no, that role was yours. Nobody could have done it better than you. You are brilliant.
941697808842805248 2017-12-15 15:53:48 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ Thats what it feels like!
941115983284105216 2017-12-13 01:21:50 UTC <Moogeebear> @FCC @AjitPaiFCC You don't care about people do you?
941115714060062720 2017-12-13 01:20:45 UTC <Moogeebear> @FCC @AjitPaiFCC PleSe do NOT do this!!!!
941115463563694080 2017-12-13 01:19:46 UTC <Moogeebear> @FCC @AjitPaiFCC Someone must be paying you off
941115370244575232 2017-12-13 01:19:24 UTC <Moogeebear> @FCC @AjitPaiFCC But I will have to pay thru the nose for it. You are making things more difficult. Too much $$$
941067042903482369 2017-12-13 22:07:21 UTC <Moogeebear> @FCC @SenateMajLdr @AjitPaiFCC We have freedom NOW and you want to take it away.
941011250011615232 2017-12-13 18:25:39 UTC <Moogeebear> @AjitPaiFCC You are going to f@ck us all over and that's what you tweet? You have more and more people hating you
941010833588486144 2017-12-13 18:24:00 UTC <Moogeebear> @AjitPaiFCC Probably because of losing net neutrality

940939149506424832 2017-12-13 13:39:09 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump Get out of office and go do something you are good at. Are you even good at golf?
940684054881619968 2017-12-12 20:45:30 UTC <Moogeebear> @FCC @AjitPaiFCC People are going to hate you. You have never seen a witch hunt yet compared to the one you will bring if u do this.
940680271766196229 2017-12-12 20:30:28 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump No

935979094700974082 2017-11-29 21:09:40 UTC <Moogeebear> @nbc @TODAYshow @MLauer Pathetic cover up. A whole network covers up for another disgusting pig. $ worth more than integrity in ur world.
935912226204078081 2017-11-29 16:43:57 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ I did in fact email prof Z like a psycho to verify no optical isomers on upcoming exam. I told her I would rip my eyes out.
935867059459772416 2017-11-29 13:44:29 UTC <Moogeebear> @MLauer FINALLY!!!!!!!!!! BOOM. It finally caught up with you. So easy to see. Idiot. You are a disgrace.

933425926020517890 2017-11-22 20:04:17 UTC <Moogeebear> @BarackObama Please, please, can't you be our president again? Everything is going backwards I can't wake up from this Trumpmare.
933424941034278913 2017-11-22 20:00:22 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ Is it there yet? Is it there yet? How about now? Um, now? We are like those little kids in the backseat!

933310759962103808 2017-11-22 12:26:39 UTC <Moogeebear> @JasonPLondon Maybe he is making up for all the years of people NOT listening or doing anything. I would scream too.
933148007314452480 2017-11-21 01:39:56 UTC <Moogeebear> @johniadarola @shoshannaclaire @BiBiTwits Obviously the people who do it
933122496584445953 2017-11-21 23:58:34 UTC <Moogeebear> @johniadarola @BiBiTwits @shoshannaclaire Agreed. Wth! Let's sexualize this topic too.... can't they stop themselves. Grrrrr
933116948212101121 2017-11-21 23:36:31 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ Wait... wtf???!!!
932988882332856320 2017-11-21 15:07:38 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ Me too!!! 
932955445165285377 2017-11-21 12:54:46 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ foot tapping away here... I want my grades!!!!! Hahaha
932454665899380736 2017-11-19 03:44:51 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ Heartbroken for you. I hope that you find them!
931679353448075265 2017-11-17 00:24:02 UTC <Moogeebear> @rosemcgowan @mae_quez @DawnaZee1 @applecrumbleg I read where they had reluctantly agreed and said "yes".
931495839071199234 2017-11-17 12:14:49 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ We do! Is she just temporarily moving? I was under that impression.
931495510824902656 2017-11-17 12:13:30 UTC <Moogeebear> @rosemcgowan @applecrumbleg @mae_quez @DawnaZee1 Except for the everyone admitting the fact that he asked them first. It is still terrible.
931369955848867840 2017-11-16 03:54:36 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ We can do this! Wait now slick boy ate the apple.
931369339445563392 2017-11-16 03:52:09 UTC <Moogeebear> @rosemcgowan @DawnaZee1 @applecrumbleg @mae_quez Definitely abuse of power.
930546626984382464 2017-11-14 21:22:59 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ Best tweet of the day!
929830609568063490 2017-11-12 21:57:47 UTC <Moogeebear> @kirstiealley @jaimesevyn Yep. You know that this is the one that concerns her.
929471314678689792 2017-11-11 22:10:04 UTC <Moogeebear> @njgrl Still looks sooo much better than mine !!
929192438048133120 2017-11-10 03:41:55 UTC <Moogeebear> @rosemcgowan @applecrumbleg @DawnaZee1 Ugh. I had not read anything about him originally denying. That is a game changer for culpability. Agreed. PR move for sure.
929146042582491137 2017-11-10 00:37:33 UTC <Moogeebear> @rosemcgowan @shoshannaclaire Maybe "honest" was not the best word of choice. He admitted it. It doesn't make it right, but he is still not in HW's ballpark. My point.
929140150839455744 2017-11-10 00:14:09 UTC <Moogeebear> @rosemcgowan @applecrumbleg Agreed. He did abuse power and they felt trapped, but he is being honest and there are no rape allegations. He is NOT HW.
929139666468687877 2017-11-10 00:12:13 UTC <Moogeebear> @rosemcgowan His is a different story. He is being honest. He did abuse power, but he did not rape anyone. He does not need to be treated like HW!
928098072571318273 2017-11-07 03:13:18 UTC <Moogeebear> He may as well pick out the interior of his coffin now. His mouth just killed his career & he doesn't have ten years for ppl to suck it up.https://twitter.com/nymag/status/928055635685539840
928068323983708162 2017-11-07 01:15:05 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ Cracking up over milligram. Did you convert it? 
927971363457044482 2017-11-07 18:49:48 UTC <Moogeebear> @_jessicabarth_ @AsiaArgento @rosemcgowan @ThomasSadoski So heartbroken that anyone had to endure this. He needs to be as broken as broken can be and then discarded completely.
927911058400038912 2017-11-07 14:50:10 UTC <Moogeebear> @USATODAY I will buy a case to give out to neighbors for Christmas!
927900313704652800 2017-11-07 14:07:28 UTC <Moogeebear> @washingtonpost He is such an idiot!!!!!
927694976179490816 2017-11-06 00:31:32 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ That was the best! Poor guy!!! 
927597481940185089 2017-11-06 18:04:08 UTC <Moogeebear> @PerezHilton Neither of them need sex rehab! They need jail time. Pedophiles, rapists & predators oh my! We aren't in Kansas anymore!
927581059818119168 2017-11-06 16:58:52 UTC <Moogeebear> @GovAbbott @VP My prayer is for strict gun controls. You can prove that God is real by taking action and making it happen.
927580576995004416 2017-11-06 16:56:57 UTC <Moogeebear> @GovAbbott @VP Nothing will happen unless you take action. We need very strict gun regulations unless you enjoy people dying. Maybe you do.
927374216038617088 2017-11-05 03:16:57 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump Please, gun control. How many more people have to die?
927374006952562689 2017-11-05 03:16:07 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump I hope you are thinking gun control after this. The terrorists are us.
927373784528678912 2017-11-05 03:15:14 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump Change is needed! Real change. Gun control would be a huge step for you!
927373570380107777 2017-11-05 03:14:23 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump when will you care? When will you do something?
927373428503515136 2017-11-05 03:13:49 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump How many need to die? Will it only matter to you if it is someone you love?
927372286360989702 2017-11-05 03:09:17 UTC <Moogeebear> @Scottrish_ And chemistry professor wants to throw everyone over the edge. Double whammy for you.
927272951908618241 2017-11-05 20:34:34 UTC <Moogeebear> @ThePerezHilton @PerezHilton I am awaiting her words. They will be powerful. More women (and men) need to speak out in this time. Predators need squashing.
927257261206056960 2017-11-05 19:32:13 UTC <Moogeebear> Our monthly mass shooting has been brought to you by @realDonaldTrump who doesn't want gun control.https://twitter.com/bbcbreaking/status/927253915900481536
927014746167050240 2017-11-04 03:28:33 UTC <Moogeebear> @zachbraff I am crying in a corner.
927014563115085825 2017-11-04 03:27:49 UTC <Moogeebear> @zachbraff No
926953737767317504 2017-11-04 23:26:07 UTC <Moogeebear> @burgundylue @joannakrupa @allieyi What is sad is what SHE said. There was no spinning. It is all there.
926953331712561153 2017-11-04 23:24:30 UTC <Moogeebear> @burgundylue @joannakrupa @allieyi What she said was wrong. If she actually owned it and had not disqualified ppl she would be viewed in a different light.

926880079791214594 2017-11-04 18:33:26 UTC <Moogeebear> @kathygriffin @ThePerezHilton In regard to Kathy Griffin..it was the first thing I thought when I saw his cover as well. Don't want comparisons then don't act out Kathy.
926858706150739968 2017-11-04 17:08:30 UTC <Moogeebear> @sunfare @ThePerezHilton You have done so well! I have seen you change over many years and I am so happy for you!!!
926829966720995328 2017-11-04 15:14:18 UTC <Moogeebear> @ThePerezHilton @MizFrizz She wishes he groped her. D list ex hooker
926829771585196032 2017-11-04 15:13:31 UTC <Moogeebear> @GMgal Please, she is an ex hooker
926829314670190592 2017-11-04 15:11:42 UTC <Moogeebear> @annehelen She is the type that would even sleep with Weinstein after this. Ex hooker
926828471778775042 2017-11-04 15:08:21 UTC <Moogeebear> @Brightly5 Why are people with such low intelligence in the spotlight? Outside package. She is pretty aesthetically, but ugly because of inside.

926635066763153409 2017-11-03 02:19:50 UTC <Moogeebear> @davidhorsey @latimes Fat shaming her was wrong and unprofessional.
926623278692732928 2017-11-03 01:33:00 UTC <Moogeebear> @JasonPLondon That's sweet and it is definitely ok to say "I would love to hug you if you are ok with that. "

926205938498973696 2017-11-02 21:54:38 UTC <Moogeebear> @joannakrupa @LolaFrijola She just deleted the tweet because she knew she was wrong and the one attention seeking! She is a freak!
926203829833650176 2017-11-02 21:46:15 UTC <Moogeebear> @rosemcgowan  somehow because it didn't happen to her it means it is untrue?? Unreal!https://twitter.com/pagesix/status/926123257568342017
926201429072711680 2017-11-02 21:36:43 UTC <Moogeebear> @joannakrupa @LolaFrijola She just wants attention. I didn't even know  who she was until she spewed her stupidity.
926200633056747521 2017-11-02 21:33:33 UTC <Moogeebear> @LolaFrijola @joannakrupa because he is a good friend to you doesn't disqualify the fact that he may have sexually harassed someone. U r just like Lindsay Lohan w/ HW
926040520752852992 2017-11-02 10:57:19 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump You are more enraged about this than you are with Vegas. Gee, wonder why.......

922134987578789894 2017-10-22 16:18:08 UTC <Moogeebear> @ramzpaul Awwwww your man panties are in a bunch.
922134440951926784 2017-10-22 16:15:57 UTC <Moogeebear> @ramzpaul Most people are intelligent enough to know the difference and it won't be blurred by your idiocy.
921356516833316864 2017-10-20 12:44:46 UTC <Moogeebear> @realDonaldTrump @JasonPLondon We're going to find out this was the ultimate in an experimental reality show reaching a world wide audience. No other explanation 4 him.
921035898740989953 2017-10-19 15:30:44 UTC <Moogeebear> @Courtney Courtney dropped the mic in 2005. That is all.
921034269476126721 2017-10-19 15:24:16 UTC <Moogeebear> @Courtney Vindicated and you deserve it! You were ahead of the justice curve. Proud times to be you.  You saved more than you know.
920821192692465665 2017-10-18 01:17:35 UTC <Moogeebear> @nypost @Corey_Feldman @BarbaraJWalters It's the industry that damages actors and you accused him of damaging an industry of abusers. Blind puppet. Apologize.
920819694684295174 2017-10-18 01:11:37 UTC <Moogeebear> @Corey_Feldman @BarbaraJWalters Where is the compassion? Objectivity? Youre damaging an entire industry! There wasn't any. Apologize
920819136179134464 2017-10-18 01:09:24 UTC <Moogeebear> @Corey_Feldman @BarbaraJWalters Ms. Walters, it would be nice to hear you publicly apologize to Corey as quickly as rudely dismissed him.
