965124949269721088 2018-02-17 07:24:53 UTC <DGreenthum> @osullivanauthor It's still amazing to me that this idiot makes comments on a DAILY basis that would've been career ending for ANY past president, right or left. When your statements to the public after a tragedy make George W seem like an articulate, level headed guy, you're WAY over the line.
965121662478962689 2018-02-17 07:11:50 UTC <DGreenthum> This is so sad.. As if the #earthquake wasn't enough tragedy.    Helicopter carrying top officials to survey #MexicoEarthquake crashes, killing 14 people, including a 6 month old baby. #HelicopterCrash #Mexicohttps://youtu.be/EYy59NpVwSI

There is bias in all mainstream media. Owned by corporations that are owned by a private banking cartel. Our economy is essentially a pyramid scheme.
961754485965180928 2018-02-08 00:11:52 UTC <DGreenthum> @chrislhayes @DarkEldarKristi @karenborton Exactly. It's funny u mention Wal-Mart. Worked there years ago. The company will "assist" employees in applying for food stamps, but will fire that same employee if they go over 40hrs in a week because they refuse to pay overtime. How sick is that?
961733308920066048 2018-02-08 22:47:43 UTC <DGreenthum> @chrislhayes @DarkEldarKristi Not true! They also do it to continue lining the pockets of people who have more than they'll ever need. Killing off the poor is just a bonus.

927383828481695746 2017-11-05 03:55:09 UTC <DGreenthum> @Massilloncom Are you saying we shouldn't bother? Just hope for the best?
927383576349499392 2017-11-05 03:54:09 UTC <DGreenthum> @Massilloncom You're right. But some of us would like to learn from the past & present to move toward a less violent future. It's called #progress.
927370237489664000 2017-11-05 03:01:08 UTC <DGreenthum> @Massilloncom The shooter was killed! Yay! Have the dead come back to life yet?? I guess you win bud. Guns are awesome. Congrats.
927359309805219840 2017-11-05 02:17:43 UTC <DGreenthum> @BarackObama @SkyrimSimmer @NastyN8_ @coughdrop2270 Doubt you'll get any kind of intelligent reply. The trend of proud ignorance in 2017 won't allow for fact based arguments.
927345920068472832 2017-11-05 01:24:31 UTC <DGreenthum> Say whatcha want about Dems. We're not perfect. All I know is that I never worried about WW3 or got called a "n*gg*r lover" under @POTUS44.
927331880680280064 2017-11-05 00:28:44 UTC <DGreenthum> White supremacists like the KKK & black supremacists like the New Black Panthers have found equality! Their blind ignorance is def equal.
927317747607982080 2017-11-05 23:32:34 UTC <DGreenthum> Well, 27 more people died today for the right wing's "right" to own machines of death. See y'all next week! #GunControl
927314316084285440 2017-11-05 23:18:56 UTC <DGreenthum> I wonder if Klansmen, self proclaimed "Jesus' soldiers," realize that there's no way in hell Jesus was white?!? http://www.netflix.com/title/80212223?source=android
927302846986555392 2017-11-05 22:33:21 UTC <DGreenthum> @Massilloncom So in reality, I suppose we should ignore the fact that innocent people are constantly dying for your right to own an instrument of death.
927299352955154433 2017-11-05 22:19:28 UTC <DGreenthum> @Massilloncom What??? I've heard some ridiculous pro-gun arguments, but wow. Just wow. This is where I get off. Take care
927297816304680962 2017-11-05 22:13:22 UTC <DGreenthum> @Massilloncom People like you and the politicians who represent you would LOVE to show that hero, but as I said, it rarely happens.
927297508002402305 2017-11-05 22:12:08 UTC <DGreenthum> @Massilloncom That's not even almost true. If a citizen stops a shooter by pulling their own gun & becoming a hero, you can be damn sure it is newsworthy.
927296303759011840 2017-11-05 22:07:21 UTC <DGreenthum> @Massilloncom Your argument is not only old-as-dirt, it never made sense. Still doesn't.
927295965572329472 2017-11-05 22:06:01 UTC <DGreenthum> @Massilloncom Ok I'll play. Tell me about how often that actually f'n helps. How often do ordinary citizens stop someone by pulling their own gun?
927294960751271943 2017-11-05 22:02:01 UTC <DGreenthum> If the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, I guess it's about time to arm the children with AR-15s!!
927293094944477184 2017-11-05 21:54:36 UTC <DGreenthum> @Massilloncom I suppose you're attempting to make the "everything can be dangerous" argument. The difference?? Guns aren't necessary in daily life genius.
927291732697468929 2017-11-05 21:49:11 UTC <DGreenthum> Is it "too soon" to point out that the shooter couldn't have shot ANYONE if he didn't own a gun? Just wondering.https://twitter.com/i/moments/927266849716359169
