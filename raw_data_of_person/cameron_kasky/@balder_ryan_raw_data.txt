971163408174387200 2018-03-06 23:19:34 UTC <balder_ryan> @KentHaeffner Economic policymaking in the current WH? That was a pretty daunting endeavor!
970860181058932736 2018-03-05 03:14:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @KyleKashuv Congrats- long overdue!
970832148763734016 2018-03-05 01:23:16 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Yes-I've seen first-hand at a young age the destructive effect on family members as well.
970481147007422465 2018-03-04 02:08:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @ptbrennan11 Tried the iced coffee once- agreed.
955103033934929920 2018-01-21 15:41:22 UTC <balder_ryan> @KentHaeffner Was at swim meet yesterday. Great job and congratulations!
941883489393217536 2017-12-15 04:11:37 UTC <balder_ryan> @SheaPatterson_1 Best of luck!!!
939686193733754881 2017-12-09 02:40:21 UTC <balder_ryan> @KentHaeffner @KailynEAllen I second that.
932812297361338369 2017-11-20 03:25:57 UTC <balder_ryan> @MrJoshPerry Apple
932377796365578240 2017-11-19 22:39:24 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Can narrow down to MLS or MLB- NHL seems relatively safe for now.
932344783464476672 2017-11-19 20:28:13 UTC <balder_ryan> @khansarinia Preferably before.
932316336511954944 2017-11-19 18:35:10 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Are you honestly still surprised anymore?
930075925391306752 2017-11-13 14:12:35 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Confirmation bias
929840652900331522 2017-11-12 22:37:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Southern politics can be very unpredictable though.
929698207168450560 2017-11-12 13:11:40 UTC <balder_ryan> @RRuffels Was thinking it was from a parody account as well at first.
929574298410475520 2017-11-11 04:59:18 UTC <balder_ryan> @KentHaeffner Am I alone in wishing that his statement had been about something else besides football?
929166415046815745 2017-11-10 01:58:31 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey With good reason.
928988789594259461 2017-11-10 14:12:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Hmm- is this the same man who railed against China during campaign and promised to designate them a currency manipulator.
928695581505146880 2017-11-09 18:47:35 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Sadly enough, depends on what your definition of GOP is anymore.
927234355650494468 2017-11-05 18:01:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Just in case you were missing Cambridge.pic.twitter.com/fDu1vdPvyk
927000578634510337 2017-11-04 02:32:15 UTC <balder_ryan> @PGATOUR Deserves to be...
926979680862965761 2017-11-04 01:09:13 UTC <balder_ryan> @MaxBoot What incredible arrogance must he have to believe that he could have  served 4 years without having his finances and past deals scrutinized.
926601679260340224 2017-11-03 00:07:10 UTC <balder_ryan> @AriMelber And this is surprising?
925505420722102272 2017-10-31 23:31:02 UTC <balder_ryan> @chrislhayes Quick to respond, but slow to think critically (if at all).
924685933655584773 2017-10-29 17:14:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @matthewamiller A GREAT movie.
924684968969850880 2017-10-29 17:10:51 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble He should be prefacing all of his tweets with that statement.
924684015583494144 2017-10-29 17:07:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @JimmyLaSalvia Predicting it's Manafort- see where it goes from there....
924682364344786944 2017-10-29 17:00:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Unlikely- moral fortitude has been sadly lacking in GOP- controlled Congress.
897979791583977476 2017-08-16 00:34:00 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble In my hometown, not happy at all.
897612614183858176 2017-08-15 00:14:58 UTC <balder_ryan> @curtainsdc @declanpgarvey Missing Cambridge yet?
896479801514618881 2017-08-12 21:13:35 UTC <balder_ryan> @realDonaldTrump @JimmyLaSalvia And somehow it's only been 204 days.
895477849792147461 2017-08-09 02:52:11 UTC <balder_ryan> @ForecasterEnten @Brendan_Noble And that is 60% of those who still identify as Republican post Trump election win and GOP failure to hold him accountable for actions.
895464584844390405 2017-08-09 01:59:28 UTC <balder_ryan> @keder @DPRK_News  is always entertaining though.
895336546685009925 2017-08-09 17:30:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill @Brendan_Noble He lasted longer than I expected...
891077862777860096 2017-07-28 23:28:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @Reince @Adam_Eversole @JimmyLaSalvia The Foxconn announcement seems to be timed to force silence of close Priebus allies Paul Ryan and Scott Walker.
891076436894900224 2017-07-28 23:22:32 UTC <balder_ryan> @JimmyLaSalvia If it's anything like past weekends, unlikely things will slow down much unfortunately.
890349616172064769 2017-07-26 23:14:25 UTC <balder_ryan> @KT_So_It_Goes @barnhab Don't forget Fox & Friends too.
890195752571600897 2017-07-26 13:03:01 UTC <balder_ryan> @Mediaite @JimmyLaSalvia Still don't understand why people are at all surprised...
888779637161177090 2017-07-22 15:15:52 UTC <balder_ryan> @politico @JimmyLaSalvia Just another reminder that loyalty to Trump is a one way street.
886693800554508289 2017-07-16 21:07:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @JimmyLaSalvia Even if nothing did come of it, the intent to collude and failure to disclose clearly is a fact.
886254814941904896 2017-07-15 16:03:08 UTC <balder_ryan> @NickKristof So much for transparency...

882281423163576322 2017-07-04 16:54:17 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Have a great 4th!
880781685729751040 2017-06-30 13:34:52 UTC <balder_ryan> @JonahNRO It was energy week? 
880597131316342785 2017-06-29 01:21:31 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey @KentHaeffner   "Ben Sasse on the Space between Nebraska and Neverland by @mercatushttps://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/ben-sasse-tyler-cowen-book-twitter-trump-cb5b4a435323
880510880710053889 2017-06-29 19:38:47 UTC <balder_ryan> @benshapiro Sadly true.
879863225235501058 2017-06-27 00:45:14 UTC <balder_ryan> @Mediaite @realDonaldTrump @JimmyLaSalvia Was definitely a high point of my day.
879493089924132864 2017-06-26 00:14:27 UTC <balder_ryan> @jpodhoretz @smoothmedia Still waiting for Breitbart to take corrective action for fake news it circulates.
877874569083838465 2017-06-22 13:03:02 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill Just like he 'suggested' Comey drop investigation of Flynn.
877162152339046401 2017-06-20 13:52:08 UTC <balder_ryan> @washingtonpost Curious to see SNL's response.
876258381270573056 2017-06-17 02:00:52 UTC <balder_ryan> @philsaggese @Brendan_Noble I agree- but unfortunately they are basically ignored by both left and right wing media.
876255722367057921 2017-06-17 01:50:18 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble @philsaggese Because conservatism has been hijacked by hypocrites such as Hannity and Coulter who have mutated it into Trumpism.
876166313307234307 2017-06-17 19:55:02 UTC <balder_ryan> @Derek_Bard A belated congrats!

876088308216016896 2017-06-17 14:45:04 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Makes no sense to me either.
875890901394100224 2017-06-16 01:40:38 UTC <balder_ryan> @aubrynathome @ananavarro And yet the 'conservative media' label Comey the coward- Sad!!

875128671882936320 2017-06-14 23:11:49 UTC <balder_ryan> @byrdinator @Brendan_Noble Agreed.
874427249080061952 2017-06-12 00:44:36 UTC <balder_ryan> @AssemblyRoomUSA Supported Rubio in election but lost respect with his lack of consistency. #DraftSasse
872888753811075072 2017-06-08 18:51:11 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey "Ignorance of the law is no excuse." I think his statement finally wiped out the last shred of respect I had for Ryan.

867863115467304961 2017-05-25 22:01:05 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Was thinking same thing as I listened!
866378922325422082 2017-05-21 19:43:26 UTC <balder_ryan> @Harvard Seminal speeches through the years http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/commencement-speeches-through-the-years/ via @harvard
865979295629553665 2017-05-20 17:15:27 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble I still can't imagine Trump resigning, even with recent developments. To do so would be admitting guilt or defeat.
865976925398999040 2017-05-20 17:06:02 UTC <balder_ryan> @TB_Times @adamsmithtimes Disappointed...
864511246795763713 2017-05-16 16:01:57 UTC <balder_ryan> @JimmyLaSalvia I keep on waiting for that 'tipping point' to be reached and continue to be disappointed.
864280214683230208 2017-05-15 00:43:55 UTC <balder_ryan> @keder Welcome back to Twitter- you've been missed!
864275870499975169 2017-05-15 00:26:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @JimmyLaSalvia Agreed- this is the constructive way to heal divisiveness of such a bitter election.
864254184484458496 2017-05-15 23:00:29 UTC <balder_ryan> @pjcolbeck @SenatorBrakey @tedcruz @SenMikeLee @RepThomasMassie @RandPaul @justinamash @Brendan_Noble + @BenSasse
863578249426870276 2017-05-13 02:14:33 UTC <balder_ryan> @BillKristol To go from being CEO of Exxon to Trump's lackey- Sad!
863481090803150849 2017-05-13 19:48:29 UTC <balder_ryan> @harvardgop Encouraged to see that HRC continues to stand for principle over partisan politics.
863175509332684803 2017-05-12 23:34:13 UTC <balder_ryan> @SenateMajLdr @JimmyLaSalvia 100% agree.
863117947384082432 2017-05-12 19:45:29 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble And no mention of capital gains, only specifically income.
862734366912413696 2017-05-11 18:21:16 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey She would be a GREAT choice, but considering McCain is  also recommending independent prosecutor..
862422548264472580 2017-05-10 21:42:13 UTC <balder_ryan> Comey fired for intensifying investigation of Trump, Russia ties: report http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/332819-trump-fired-comey-for-not-providing-him-assurance-of-personal-loyalty #russiagate
862395664067690497 2017-05-10 19:55:23 UTC <balder_ryan> @JoyceWhiteVance @AriMelber Trump has said his administration is not bound by ethics rules, so not too surprising.
862083619661242368 2017-05-09 23:15:26 UTC <balder_ryan> @EWErickson Until Trump fires him as well. #russiagate
862077540936167426 2017-05-09 22:51:17 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble For GOP to maintain any appearance of integrity now, it's time to appoint special investigator. #russiagate
861719174493741057 2017-05-08 23:07:15 UTC <balder_ryan> @RepLeeZeldin Extremely disappointed Lee. If this legislation had not been rushed through with no time for review, there would be less misinformation.
861232486076043265 2017-05-07 14:53:20 UTC <balder_ryan> @justinamash @Brendan_Noble If only more politicians evaluated their decisions so conscientiously.
861057249338437632 2017-05-06 03:17:00 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill @bobdevaughn And raises question- why would ANYONE want job of having to justify and 'translate' all of his incomprehensible and inane statements??
860574353263669248 2017-05-05 19:18:09 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Now I really understand why you stopped ranking gop candidates below your top eight.
860318887748960258 2017-05-04 02:23:01 UTC <balder_ryan> @byrdinator @Brendan_Noble
860311502569562113 2017-05-04 01:53:40 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill @bobdevaughn Agreed- pathetic attempt to show he made attempt to pass legislation and deflect blame when it fails in Senate.
859952590360109056 2017-05-03 02:07:29 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble That's why I stand with Evan McMullin.
859898146499022849 2017-05-03 22:31:08 UTC <PoliticusSarah> Just yesterday Trump voters wanted Colbert fired but today they're cheering the #LicenseToDiscriminate. This is called having no values.
859871494184284160 2017-05-03 20:45:14 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Definition of cult: "misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing"
859461509491150855 2017-05-02 17:36:06 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Absolutely agree- but unlikely he would support if he believed Schumer or Pelosi would be in majority in 2 years.
859460457068994560 2017-05-02 17:31:55 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble It only aids the minority party in Congress, which the GOP may soon be in 2018 if they don't improve their accountability to constituents.
859126690626371585 2017-05-01 19:25:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill @bobdevaughn Except for Breitbart.
859124514743103488 2017-05-01 19:17:00 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble I actually believe these outrageous statements are intentional to deflect away from other issues- and it seems to be pretty effective...
858721699432476673 2017-04-30 16:36:22 UTC <balder_ryan> Turkey Purges 4,000 More Officials, and Blocks Wikipedia https://nyti.ms/2qlonKR @Brendan_Noble And now blocking Wikipedia as well...
858102661475946497 2017-04-28 23:36:31 UTC <balder_ryan> @RtOnPrinciple Makes you wonder if he really even understands what the terms mean...
857964538582507523 2017-04-28 14:27:40 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Possible responses from Trump: blame Obama admin, blame Congress for not enacting his agenda, or ignoring it altogether
857794081057067010 2017-04-27 03:10:20 UTC <balder_ryan> @MattBevin Looking forward to Derby day too!!
857773226033852422 2017-04-27 01:47:28 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Since Congress refuses to block any of the WH's abuses of power, the courts are basically being forced to intervene and review exec action.
857770519785086977 2017-04-27 01:36:43 UTC <balder_ryan> @KentHaeffner I'm jealous!- would have same reaction.
857682536327258112 2017-04-27 19:47:06 UTC <balder_ryan> @SalenaZito @Brendan_Noble An article by a writer I respect- disturbing to see how Trump's base still standing by support for him despite last 100 days
857678077660418048 2017-04-27 19:29:23 UTC <balder_ryan> @khansarinia @declanpgarvey @JWGOP @JohnKasich @KentHaeffner Kasich would have been able to heal much of the divisiveness which emerged during last admin and significantly worsened since the election.
857675531604676609 2017-04-27 19:19:16 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Having issues with it as well, but restricting funding through process which could be easily exploited for political purposes seems improper
857302774962409478 2017-04-26 18:38:04 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble The executive branch has duty to enforce the laws, not the right to legislate and create laws to arbitrarily penalize jurisdictions.
857289457812328449 2017-04-26 17:45:09 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Agreed- but it should be the Congress, not unilateral decision by executive branch.
857205278755966976 2017-04-26 12:10:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @jaketapper So much for the 'great dealmaker'.
856959861279600645 2017-04-25 19:55:27 UTC <balder_ryan> @ForeignPolicy @MaxBoot The 84% GOP approval figure does not take into account how many people who have changed party affiliation due to Trump electoral victory.
856228362196582400 2017-04-23 19:28:44 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill Mocking a state and undermining the judiciary is not the type of humor you would expect from the Attorney General.
856214583727534080 2017-04-23 18:33:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Disappointed with results of 1st round as well. Looks like this is another tough instance of 'best of the worst' there as well.
855967844139499521 2017-04-22 02:13:31 UTC <balder_ryan> @greta I enjoyed your reporting on Fox news and I enjoy it now on MSNBC.
855816942262902784 2017-04-22 16:13:54 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Agreed- clearly misleading reporting such as this one only bolsters Trump's media bias claims.

855207852394381312 2017-04-20 23:53:35 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill @bobdevaughn Agreed- this administration has consistently attempted to undermine authority and respect for judicial branch.
855204078573555712 2017-04-20 23:38:35 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill It's one of the 50 states, not just an "island in the Pacific." Extremely inappropriate & disrespectful statement for an Attorney General.

853394040624173057 2017-04-15 23:46:09 UTC <balder_ryan> @Brendan_Noble Previously would have agreed with you, but after watching GOP House blatantly allowing abuses of power and ethics rules without reaction...

808811087181348864 2016-12-13 23:09:24 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey His violation of State Department policy in making deal with the Kurdish is a bit concerning as well.

808722077574373376 2016-12-13 17:15:43 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Not even the slightest doubt.
808538529940852736 2016-12-12 05:06:22 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey He doesn't need to worry about minor things like spelling- he'll have the 'best people'....
808163946985377793 2016-12-11 04:17:54 UTC <balder_ryan> @EconTalker @KentHaeffner @declanpgarvey A good read.
807725187827466240 2016-12-10 23:14:26 UTC <balder_ryan> @FoxNews @Sport_stock @amanda_pompili Give him time and he will do something so irresponsible and reckless that markets will be tumbling.
807723843532029952 2016-12-10 23:09:05 UTC <balder_ryan> @JayAlver @KentHaeffner It's also time for Trump supporters to realize he is essentially mocking them with his choice of appointees.
807612135996067840 2016-12-10 15:45:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @CharlesHurt Although I often disagree with you, I've always respected your opinions. Sad to see you make such a dangerous generalization.

807347056847310848 2016-12-09 22:11:52 UTC <balder_ryan> @CNBCnow @JayAlver @KentHaeffner Sadly enough, he has majority of his followers brainwashed to such an extent that it will have no effect
807326910321664000 2016-12-09 20:51:49 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey McMullin remains one of the few to vocally express his concern about the alarming behavior of Trump since the  election.
807019480996020224 2016-12-08 00:30:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Sounds promising so far!

806873303054958593 2016-12-08 14:49:21 UTC <balder_ryan> @Patbagley That's one too many logical jumps for Trump to be able to make.
806872802791948288 2016-12-08 14:47:21 UTC <balder_ryan> @bhgreeley Certainly not the GOP anymore!
806870828528898048 2016-12-08 14:39:31 UTC <balder_ryan> @DPAQreport @declanpgarvey He's done such a terrible job yet they've kept him for 17 yrs.
806703586784739329 2016-12-07 03:34:57 UTC <balder_ryan> @natehollern23 Agreed- pretty irritating.
806653616346005505 2016-12-07 00:16:23 UTC <balder_ryan> @natehollern23 Can add him to growing list of people who have compromised all principles to join Trump love fest.

806326032743665665 2016-12-06 02:34:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @sivavaid @declanpgarvey Somehow I doubt you will see this reported in Breitbart news.
806288084681818113 2016-12-06 00:03:54 UTC <balder_ryan> @natehollern23 @declanpgarvey Unbelievable...
805075342423654400 2016-12-03 15:44:53 UTC <balder_ryan> @ddkochel Unlikely- Trump does not have financial interest in company.
805074173857042434 2016-12-03 15:40:15 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Same reaction.
805073433973391361 2016-12-03 15:37:18 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey And he is still only president-elect.

804910978995458048 2016-12-02 04:51:46 UTC <balder_ryan> @AnnCoulter Yes, it is. The facts were clearly there, yet you chose to ignore them.
804847969539330048 2016-12-02 00:41:23 UTC <balder_ryan> @TheRickWilson @mrshellwinger I believe that's what they call a conflict of interest.
804682734870364160 2016-12-02 13:44:48 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey "Be humble in victory and gracious in defeat." - Obviously not something Conway and Trump campaign understand.
804541610381996032 2016-12-01 04:24:02 UTC <balder_ryan> @LeonHWolf @harvardgop He obviously did not pay attention in college when they discussed the concept of moral hazard.

804042131904069636 2016-11-30 19:19:17 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey I may question motivations of many other public figures now but I strongly believe Romney is putting nation's interests first

803708664284581888 2016-11-29 21:14:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Agreed- and this only allows him more unnecessary publicity and will increase his stature among Trump followers.
803695741160005632 2016-11-29 20:22:51 UTC <balder_ryan> @natehollern23 Couldn't agree more.

803255871623012352 2016-11-28 15:14:58 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey That was obviously just another one of his scripted excuses for campaign purposes only.

800868638643220483 2016-11-21 01:08:57 UTC <balder_ryan> @KentHaeffner These are the positive, uplifting stories that the media largely chooses to ignore. Thanks for sharing.

799418106221240320 2016-11-17 01:05:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey I should have read this tweet first -not very optimistic for same reasons.
799417543375077377 2016-11-17 01:02:49 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Would be GREAT but very distrustful of 'direct knowledge of his thinking' based upon record to date.
799345741000888321 2016-11-17 20:17:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @ddkochel Direct knowledge of his thinking? I will take it more seriously when he stops treating cabinet appointments like reality show.

797869016438095872 2016-11-13 18:29:31 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Trump is redefining the meaning of the term 'presidential' in the worst way possible.
797632522884620288 2016-11-12 02:49:47 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey It's clear why his message was so successful. Still unclear why people should believe this message delivered by a billionaire
797619679200219136 2016-11-12 01:58:45 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey He needs to save those positions for lobbyists and political donors.
797440614044471296 2016-11-12 14:07:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @ddkochel I can admit I underestimated his appeal to large segment of population but will not apologize for my previous diagnosis of him.
796912883456245760 2016-11-10 03:10:11 UTC <balder_ryan> @chrislhayes Sadly he regained access to his twitter account.

796807905831833602 2016-11-10 20:13:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Agree 100%! Gained new respect for him over last year & he will leave behind a strong legacy regardless of election outcome
796547591454552064 2016-11-09 02:58:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @JonathanTurley @FoxNews And what would have been the reaction of Trump campaign and supporters if situation were reversed?

796448999507013632 2016-11-09 20:26:53 UTC <balder_ryan> @ddkochel Trump created such divisiveness during the campaign that it will be nearly impossible to foster any sense of unity.
796215343035404290 2016-11-08 04:58:25 UTC <balder_ryan> @JohnSActon A tragic night.
796214660634738688 2016-11-08 04:55:42 UTC <balder_ryan> @natehollern23 Still in shock here.
796196449956589569 2016-11-08 03:43:20 UTC <balder_ryan> @benshapiro Why?????
796155713475248133 2016-11-08 01:01:28 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Inspiring!
796088469898530817 2016-11-08 20:34:16 UTC <balder_ryan> @harvardgop While the media focused most of its attention on the presidential race, thank you for not losing sight of the big picture.
796084344993497088 2016-11-08 20:17:53 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Current situation still feels like bad dream. With so many qualified candidates, Bush at top of list, this is what we have.
795967205020143617 2016-11-08 12:32:24 UTC <balder_ryan> @Snapchat @brendangarvey24 @declanpgarvey Very impressive with interesting perspectives.
795805546314104832 2016-11-07 01:50:02 UTC <balder_ryan> @GOP @declanpgarvey That's a big 'If', however, Massachusetts can certainly do better.
795709150718201856 2016-11-07 19:26:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey VERY impressive- thanks for sharing!
795338441772990468 2016-11-06 18:53:55 UTC <balder_ryan> @washingtonpost Not a surprise- his entire campaign has been built on lies and misinformation. #NeverTrump
795286841285021696 2016-11-06 15:28:53 UTC <balder_ryan> @dcexaminer @RepJeffDuncan And Trump used foundation resources to pay unrelated legal expenses.
794687280736862208 2016-11-04 23:46:26 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Not surprising- the only reading Trump does is on twitter.
794575720794075136 2016-11-04 16:23:08 UTC <balder_ryan> @mschlapp I am disappointed you have chosen to support Trump over the ONLY  principled conservative in the race, @Evan_McMullin
794531020020346885 2016-11-04 13:25:31 UTC <balder_ryan> @RABAresearch @SimpsonCollege @ddkochel Since Johnson vote is critical here, curious if polling occurred before or after Weld's comments.
794521481288044544 2016-11-04 12:47:37 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Had same reaction!!!
794519252694876160 2016-11-04 12:38:45 UTC <balder_ryan> @chrislhayes @declanpgarvey @natehollern23
794518228336840704 2016-11-04 12:34:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @TexasTribAbby None of this should be surprising at this point.
794392883877048320 2016-11-03 04:16:37 UTC <balder_ryan> @khansarinia Unfortunately, it's his father's rhetoric which is responsible for his reentry into politics and the rise of the alt-right.
794386336539168768 2016-11-03 03:50:36 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Must be great time to be back there!
794384674386755584 2016-11-03 03:43:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Agreed- but Trump & surrogates have manipulated people's insecurities & real grievances into cult-like animosity of system.
794380149051584512 2016-11-03 03:26:01 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Just another reminder of why @BenSasse remains at the top of my shrinking list of principled members of congress.
794294628673433601 2016-11-03 21:46:11 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Just like NO ONE treats women better than him.
794205132246417410 2016-11-03 15:50:33 UTC <balder_ryan> @JebBush @declanpgarvey Feel same way...
794189303551295488 2016-11-03 14:47:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill This ignores voters who now identify as independents as a result of Trump. #NeverTrump
794175237902450688 2016-11-03 13:51:46 UTC <balder_ryan> @KellyannePolls So you don't believe intelligence reports just because Trump says Putin is a 'good guy'.
794173667467034624 2016-11-03 13:45:32 UTC <balder_ryan> @IngrahamAngle Think you have it backwards. Hillary has get-out-the- vote operation-- named Trump.
793921982102462466 2016-11-02 21:05:25 UTC <balder_ryan> @Movember @reillywalsh1 Great cause-done.
793900194047913984 2016-11-02 19:38:50 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey And these are only the well-publicized cases.
793614364603449344 2016-11-01 00:43:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @IngrahamAngle Trump had done NOTHING to unite the party. #NeverTrump #IStandWithEvan
793559769030225920 2016-11-01 21:06:07 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill Not surprising...
793540024310562816 2016-11-01 19:47:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @NickHardy8 @eastlakecup @GolfChannel @IlliniMGolf Go Nick!
793539185441280000 2016-11-01 19:44:19 UTC <balder_ryan> @Evan_McMullin @evansiegfried + @BenSasse represent the future of conservative movement, regardless of election result, not Trump/Pence.
793535264819904512 2016-11-01 19:28:44 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Well then, that changes everything.
792879091548622848 2016-10-30 00:01:21 UTC <balder_ryan> @marcorubio @declanpgarvey Still preferable to the endless unwanted Trump and GOP donation emails.
792738972057292800 2016-10-30 14:44:33 UTC <balder_ryan> @mschlapp So why doesn't Trump release his taxes and his wife's immigration records.
792574496314105856 2016-10-29 03:50:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @joannesmoot @DonDonjjames Don't forget his promise to release his wife's immigration records...
792571639456227329 2016-10-29 03:39:38 UTC <balder_ryan> @SteveDeaceShow So much for Palin's endorsement....
792562691294519297 2016-10-29 03:04:05 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Not over yet!!!
792506038029254656 2016-10-29 23:18:58 UTC <balder_ryan> @JahamaMama BIG game tonight. Go Cubs!!!
792140796107554821 2016-10-28 23:07:37 UTC <balder_ryan> @ATabarrok And Trump supporters suddenly praise him after he releases emails so close to the election.
791980623384682497 2016-10-28 12:31:09 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried Never cease to be amazed how delusional he is.
791661820620705799 2016-10-27 15:24:21 UTC <balder_ryan> @StevenEJohnston @declanpgarvey Love it- that's great!
791640592929267713 2016-10-27 13:59:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @ddkochel Agreed- lost respect for so many people this election cycle...
791639843721744385 2016-10-27 13:57:01 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried I continue to receive material daily from Trump campaign and RNC. Obviously they don't know their target voters. #NeverTrump
791636607514185728 2016-10-27 13:44:09 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Realistically, I think this election has probably divided more friends and family than any in recent history.
791458981529223168 2016-10-26 01:58:20 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Don't feel too bad- so can I.
791452683697844224 2016-10-26 01:33:18 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Dangerous precedent set by former elected official but not surprising considering rhetoric spewed by Trump and campaign.
791450667609124864 2016-10-26 01:25:18 UTC <balder_ryan> @hfp325 Just like his other surrogates, her reputation is permanently tainted by her close association with him.
791449922071629824 2016-10-26 01:22:20 UTC <balder_ryan> @natehollern23 He is not too well-liked here in New England...
791384954567430144 2016-10-26 21:04:11 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Surprised that the stressful election figure is not higher.
791307452214079488 2016-10-26 15:56:13 UTC <balder_ryan> @scrowder Agreed- complete hypocrisy.
790912624032612352 2016-10-25 13:47:18 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey And that's only since declaring his candidacy.
790911342089740288 2016-10-25 13:42:13 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Fox News should be embarrassed at this point to still broadcast his show.
790701393061502976 2016-10-24 23:47:57 UTC <balder_ryan> @KellyannePolls @hfp325 Trump's entire campaign has been based upon lies and misinformation.
790381709766385664 2016-10-23 02:37:38 UTC <balder_ryan> @mitchellvii This conveniently ignores fact that Hillary has 95% likelihood based upon electoral college figures.
790324736060432384 2016-10-23 22:51:15 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey I still like Rubio but this polling  result is not too surprising considering his on/off support for Trump.
790323681486659584 2016-10-23 22:47:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Absolutely true.
790017413215584257 2016-10-22 02:30:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @Cubs 
790015810035150849 2016-10-22 02:23:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @LogCabinGOP @declanpgarvey Considering that the alt right is a core part of his support, they are wise to view his promises with suspicion.
790002085752401924 2016-10-22 01:29:09 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey What a game!!
789965556959117312 2016-10-22 23:04:00 UTC <balder_ryan> @RichLowry And before or after his Trump U fraud case is settled?
789965051008606208 2016-10-22 23:01:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @RichLowry It's called the Trump factor.
789963953560555524 2016-10-22 22:57:38 UTC <balder_ryan> @natehollern23 I am stunned his support is even that high. Trump is NOT a conservative.
789963054465294336 2016-10-22 22:54:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Haha- needed a good laugh today!
789962650948136960 2016-10-22 22:52:27 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Feel the same way- my opinion of FLOTUS has also increased greatly over the past year.
789895388803235840 2016-10-22 18:25:10 UTC <balder_ryan> @volduckmike @declanpgarvey He completely abandoned all rational thinking and conservative principles in exchange for 'Trumpism'.
789892598471266304 2016-10-22 18:14:05 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey I'm originally from here and did not know either!!
789663312942333953 2016-10-21 03:02:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Tough times ahead with strong idealistic leadership needed.
789662047579627520 2016-10-21 02:57:58 UTC <balder_ryan> @seanhannity @declanpgarvey sacrificed conservative principles for personal gain while Sasse defied state GOP, remained loyal to his beliefs
789635684474707969 2016-10-21 01:13:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried Had same reaction.  .
789633450802343936 2016-10-21 01:04:20 UTC <balder_ryan> @FoxNews @20committee He is prepping for his new role with Trump TV
789632010063081472 2016-10-21 00:58:36 UTC <balder_ryan> @mschlapp Disappointed that you continue to stand with Trump despite presence of a TRUE conservative in race. #IStandWithEvan
789630288313851904 2016-10-21 00:51:46 UTC <balder_ryan> @Freedland @alfonslopeztena Raises important question- would things have been different if these had been released during primaries?
789627800252739584 2016-10-21 00:41:52 UTC <balder_ryan> Whoops: Pro-Donald Trump super PAC publishes donor credit card numbers https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/10/21/20370/whoops-pro-donald-trump-super-pac-publishes-donor-credit-card-numbers via @Publici
789622214379339776 2016-10-21 00:19:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @ddkochel Love it.
789619936876429312 2016-10-21 00:10:38 UTC <balder_ryan> @jaketapper @declanpgarvey A stark reminder of why we will need strong leaders such as @Evan_McMullin & @BenSasse to rebuild party.
789582184076054528 2016-10-21 21:40:37 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey We're in major trouble...
789560002616893440 2016-10-21 20:12:28 UTC <balder_ryan> @joshcparker Good luck!!
789503324215185408 2016-10-21 16:27:15 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey What's the latest update on the playoff goatee?
789291161622044672 2016-10-20 02:24:11 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried His disgusting conduct tonight again accomplished the impossible- made Hillary look honorable and presidential by comparison
789289518260166656 2016-10-20 02:17:40 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey When even Beitbart releases poll showing him losing debate, it's over....
789257445180841984 2016-10-20 00:10:13 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried The sign of a poor leader.
789254451286671361 2016-10-20 23:58:19 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried And if he doesn't win, it was rigged.
789253884707504128 2016-10-20 23:56:04 UTC <balder_ryan> @JohnSActon Worried about same thing....
789207503062073344 2016-10-20 20:51:46 UTC <balder_ryan> @chrislhayes @InsiderSubo @MattSchiavenza The name recognition plus media desire for Trump vs. Clinton election were the critical factors.
789173260147499010 2016-10-20 18:35:42 UTC <balder_ryan> @bridgestonegolf @b_dechambeau Get well soon!!
789136668628545536 2016-10-20 16:10:17 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Even with the low bar set, still requires judging the best of the worst.
789135912768856064 2016-10-20 16:07:17 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey You were right the first time.
789097803146522624 2016-10-20 13:35:51 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Desperation to find some type of criticism.
788930630063194113 2016-10-19 02:31:34 UTC <balder_ryan> @khansarinia Tragic...
788924809346506752 2016-10-19 02:08:26 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Why can't I change the channel??
788917578458656768 2016-10-19 01:39:42 UTC <balder_ryan> @KFILE And moderator is not saying a thing....
788916056312119296 2016-10-19 01:33:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey I guess not!
788915652413259778 2016-10-19 01:32:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey He just makes it SO easy to think she is good.
788912991584522244 2016-10-19 01:21:29 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey And Wallace is not confronting him about past contradictory statements.
788861414484115456 2016-10-19 21:56:32 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey And that's not even including the pre/post debate analysis. Very depressing.
788815641457356801 2016-10-19 18:54:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey His tax returns PLUS the forgotten promise to release his wife's past immigration records.
788814476581666816 2016-10-19 18:50:01 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey With any other GOP candidate, she would have been forced to constantly defend her own poor record.
788814012788203520 2016-10-19 18:48:10 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey As a registered voter in Massachusetts, I feel exactly the same way.
788466374528098304 2016-10-18 19:46:47 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Electoral map would  look so different with ANY of the other 15 candidates instead
788401028366372865 2016-10-18 15:27:07 UTC <balder_ryan> @MorningJoe @ddkochel Closer than when Trump said election date was 11/28 (Trump U case begins).
788375715888652289 2016-10-18 13:46:32 UTC <balder_ryan> @ddkochel Brutally accurate account of the danger this man poses.
788342959402024961 2016-10-18 11:36:22 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Thanks- first laugh of the day.
788208344888709120 2016-10-17 02:41:28 UTC <balder_ryan> @Cubs @declanpgarvey Still a good show of team spirit!
788158829787770880 2016-10-17 23:24:42 UTC <balder_ryan> @ddkochel Trump has never needed an excuse to make offensive statements.
788099021852307457 2016-10-17 19:27:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @FT What a surprise....
788098221713350656 2016-10-17 19:23:52 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Absolutely indefensible for elected official to praise organization that has endangered lives of US citizens abroad.
788096246816931841 2016-10-17 19:16:02 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey @ddkochel It's tragic that Jeb's foresight & solid grasp of issues were overshadowed by Trump's ignorance & hateful rhetoric.
788094190769041408 2016-10-17 19:07:51 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey The hallmark of a poor leader.
787827643232161792 2016-10-16 01:28:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @JahamaMama Great job yesterday- looking forward to seeing you play for Lizards next year!
787742964671971328 2016-10-16 19:52:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @ddkochel @declanpgarvey Florida governor Rick Scott 'rigged' Florida election for Trump by blocking McMullin from ballot.
787740232628273156 2016-10-16 19:41:21 UTC <balder_ryan> @JohnSActon Trump was the only major GOP candidate not thoroughly vetted during primaries, even though it was obvious he had shadiest past.
787736196734717952 2016-10-16 19:25:19 UTC <balder_ryan> @chrislhayes WHEN they make the World Series. #Cubs #FlyTheW
787735665047928833 2016-10-16 19:23:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @jbarro Sadly enough, we'll probably have Trump TV by then as well.
787734747283939328 2016-10-16 19:19:33 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried As he previously always said, he always surrounds himself with the 'best people'.
787734092431388672 2016-10-16 19:16:57 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Cherry pie?
787733747953262592 2016-10-16 19:15:35 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey It's truly sad how Pence continues to subvert his own views in favor of Trump's flawed ideas.
787495294690820096 2016-10-15 03:28:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey WOW!!!!!!
787490436357169152 2016-10-15 03:08:45 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey On edge of seat here.
787454677818413056 2016-10-15 00:46:40 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey In theory, we should also have an inclusive GOP candidate who actually represents Republican principles.
787443733105172480 2016-10-15 00:03:10 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey @MarkSalter55 As Dana Perino so eloquently said, it's become impossible to defend so many of these people now.
787379093415268352 2016-10-15 19:46:19 UTC <balder_ryan> @Phil_Mattingly And think what a collosal waste of time and energy.
787378423656280064 2016-10-15 19:43:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @Phil_Mattingly I thought he said before that the election was November 28th?
787303765347041280 2016-10-15 14:46:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried The media as a whole got exactly what they wanted- Clinton vs. Trump in dirtiest election campaign ever.
787302873273163776 2016-10-15 14:43:27 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried It's too late. His political future has been permanently tainted by his association and now defense of Trump.
787083488944160768 2016-10-14 00:11:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey And he somehow expects people to believe he has changed???
786960519177601024 2016-10-14 16:03:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey I watched Chris Hayes on MSNBC & then Megyn Kelly on Fox News. Like your choice a lot better!
786739567604953088 2016-10-13 01:25:04 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Happy to see that http://trump.tv domain is owned by a #nevertrump citizen!!
786731405623562241 2016-10-13 00:52:38 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey His surrogates are already prepping for this inevitable result with the conspiracy theories of the election being rigged.
786657121752518656 2016-10-13 19:57:27 UTC <balder_ryan> @MollieReilly @samsteinhp Is anyone really surprised anymore?
786652886679883776 2016-10-13 19:40:38 UTC <balder_ryan> @FLOTUS @declanpgarvey Haven't seen anything yet, but no doubt it is coming! (Hope exam went well)
786652200021921792 2016-10-13 19:37:54 UTC <balder_ryan> @Camtripp15 Happy Birthday!
786625279393488896 2016-10-13 17:50:56 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Feel same way- have lost respect for so many people over last several months....
786604730961231872 2016-10-13 16:29:16 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Agree that he can't handle tough questions -but tough questioning of Trump on Hannity show??? Must be more to story.
786562718773960704 2016-10-13 13:42:20 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey With a twitter history like his, how can anyone claim to be surprised by recent revelations???
786408963390726144 2016-10-12 03:31:22 UTC <balder_ryan> @MittRomney @katiepack @declanpgarvey Couldn't agree more!!
786402252705726464 2016-10-12 03:04:42 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill A changed man??
786384543737647104 2016-10-12 01:54:20 UTC <balder_ryan> @harvardgop Sounds like a positive exchange of ideas in your debate. It's too bad the nominees are unable to do the same.
786366771892596736 2016-10-12 00:43:43 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey He opened door to this when he brought former Clinton accusers, whom he had previously denounced, as guests to the debate .
786365820066607104 2016-10-12 00:39:56 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey On the democratic side, began with 3 and ended up with expected choice. On republican side we had 15 other choices-truly sad.
786343105511428096 2016-10-12 23:09:40 UTC <balder_ryan> @Nate_Cohn Unbelievable!- but not surprising news services like Breitbart latched onto its results until now.
786315346231824384 2016-10-12 21:19:22 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Just another shared view with his 'friend' Putin.
786291663119323140 2016-10-12 19:45:15 UTC <balder_ryan> @StMartinsPress @SenSasse @PublishersWkly Looking forward to it!
786290852159074304 2016-10-12 19:42:02 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Any good insights or memorable moments?
786203759399567360 2016-10-12 13:55:57 UTC <balder_ryan> @jbarro Or he is just doing what he does best-lying.
786191579224608768 2016-10-12 13:07:33 UTC <balder_ryan> @jbarro But he said he's changed...
786168551753166848 2016-10-12 11:36:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @thehill The facts say otherwise.
786166561639796736 2016-10-12 11:28:09 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey @LeonHWolf Fortunately Nebraska still has one principled senator (Sasse) who has remained firm in his condemnation of Trump.
786057155052965890 2016-10-11 04:13:24 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey NLCS- here we come!! #FlyTheW
786009112463089664 2016-10-11 01:02:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Prior to the election, I just considered Trump an egotistical moron. Sadly, I greatly underestimated his sheer ignorance.

785946345706094592 2016-10-11 20:53:05 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Solid argument.
785927075286790144 2016-10-11 19:36:31 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey First Bush and now Weld. Great to see your group continues to host the remaining courageous politicians.
785924391666233344 2016-10-11 19:25:51 UTC <balder_ryan> @Alex_Burge Best thing I've seen today!
785860381562601472 2016-10-11 15:11:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey + Trump TV
785831854175846400 2016-10-11 13:18:08 UTC <balder_ryan> @realDonaldTrump #delusionaldonald - every poll except Breitbart (Trump)News said you lost.
785809080002547712 2016-10-11 11:47:38 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey With Red Sox out, I'll be pulling for Cubs tonight too- think it's their year!
785695498762006528 2016-10-10 04:16:19 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey With one notable exception- Trump's disgusting treatment of @megynkelly in debate. Warning signs have been there all along.
785693697941708800 2016-10-10 04:09:09 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey THIS is the pivotal question GOP just doesn't understand. Doesn't address the now disgusted & disenfranchised current voters.
785691684587712512 2016-10-10 04:01:09 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Trump thinks of presidency as a  dictatorship so he does not care about anything but his own success.
785691076698910721 2016-10-10 03:58:44 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Had so many opportunities during primary debates to evaluate candidates and this is what we ended up with....
785567958894514176 2016-10-10 19:49:31 UTC <balder_ryan> @samsteinhp WOW- what a surprise. Trump winning poll by Trump News.
785567327811145728 2016-10-10 19:47:00 UTC <balder_ryan> @Cubs @declanpgarvey I don't blame you a bit (even though I'm a red sox fan)!! 28 days to go....
785566381945262081 2016-10-10 19:43:15 UTC <balder_ryan> @KatrinaPierson And when Trump campaigned heavily for Renee Elmers in NC and she lost by 30 pts? @declanpgarvey
785551355511439360 2016-10-10 18:43:32 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Profile is evidence of months of Trump cult brainwashing.
785532553239400448 2016-10-10 17:28:49 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey He embarrassed his running mate, praised a brutal dictator, & lied about opposing Iraq war. Should not be considered a win.
785518831481520128 2016-10-10 16:34:18 UTC <balder_ryan> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle No, they look principled- a concept you have obviously forgotten since joining the Trump cult.
785310917672116226 2016-10-09 02:48:07 UTC <balder_ryan> @EWErickson Don't even know what to say to that...
785310329907585024 2016-10-09 02:45:47 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey She also knows that further scandals will continue to emerge.
785309599649980416 2016-10-09 02:42:53 UTC <balder_ryan> @mattklewis Until the next big controversy arises.
785308133061226496 2016-10-09 02:37:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Will there be a 3rd debate now?
785307631221112834 2016-10-09 02:35:04 UTC <balder_ryan> @IngrahamAngle The fact checkers are working hard to keep up with his endless spin and lies.
785306835209297921 2016-10-09 02:31:54 UTC <balder_ryan> @RNRMississippi And why is he taking campaign donations and funneling into his own companies?
785304418451415045 2016-10-09 02:22:18 UTC <balder_ryan> @MaxBoot Says the candidate who inspired David Duke to run for office again.
785303639548190721 2016-10-09 02:19:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @MikePenceVP @declanpgarvey Trump just nullified impact of Pence's debate performance in one statement.
785302831800709120 2016-10-09 02:15:59 UTC <balder_ryan> What is the count so far for use of the word 'disaster' by Trump? #debate
785299941082136576 2016-10-09 02:04:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @EWErickson Explains the low energy and sniffles.
785293584375377920 2016-10-09 01:39:15 UTC <balder_ryan> @realDonaldTrump @declanpgarvey Flashback to Rubio and Trump in debate- "The lines"
785289328389922816 2016-10-09 01:22:20 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey "Low energy"
785285621959065600 2016-10-09 01:07:36 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Feel same way..
785209556020236288 2016-10-09 20:05:21 UTC <balder_ryan> @PhilipRucker @danbalz @declanpgarvey Hard to deny. Can only hope to mitigate damage now.
785202653915705345 2016-10-09 19:37:55 UTC <balder_ryan> @Camtripp15 Ready for tonight's debate?
785159384028643329 2016-10-09 16:45:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Sad to see this man go from respected former mayor to Trump apologizer and lackey.
785157893678960640 2016-10-09 16:40:04 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey If he cared at all about the future of the country, he would step down.
784881572977709056 2016-10-08 22:22:04 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Greatly appreciate all of the updates throughout the day. Gratifying to see GOP taking decisive action.
784779061646229504 2016-10-08 15:34:43 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey About time that people finally realize what type of person he really is but with his massive ego he won't willingly step down
784566220716646401 2016-10-07 01:28:58 UTC <balder_ryan> @samsteinhp And what is his definition of 'debate prep'?......
784551787978170368 2016-10-07 00:31:37 UTC <balder_ryan> @MaxBoot None of the recent revelations about Trump should be a surprise.
784170090723966976 2016-10-06 23:14:53 UTC <balder_ryan> @mviser No
784120978750124032 2016-10-06 19:59:44 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Very disappointed to hear it...
784019792013295616 2016-10-06 13:17:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @megynkelly @stuartpstevens @evansiegfried Caught replay as well last night. Was good segment after the insane rhetoric by Trump spox before
783857686374998017 2016-10-05 02:33:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @billpostmus He is nothing but free propaganda for Trump and obviously angling for key role on Trump TV..
783855700078366720 2016-10-05 02:25:36 UTC <balder_ryan> @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews What difference does it make? Trump TV and profiting from election were his ultimate goals anyways.
783854692354945025 2016-10-05 02:21:36 UTC <balder_ryan> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @megynkelly @seanhannity After realizing he clearly failed miserably, he ran to safe interview with Hannity
783848125228261378 2016-10-05 01:55:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @guypbenson That time again already?
783831914251771904 2016-10-05 00:51:05 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Trump TV- don't remind me! 
783829876604297216 2016-10-05 00:43:00 UTC <balder_ryan> @FoxNews @declanpgarvey Was unrealistically hoping the change in management would have effect on some of their coverage. i.e. #dumphannity
783813666365898752 2016-10-05 23:38:35 UTC <balder_ryan> @jtmcintire @TheQC_ Extremely well written and painfully accurate.
783752756976844800 2016-10-05 19:36:33 UTC <balder_ryan> @realDonaldTrump And where is Palin now? Pushed aside by Trump after she outlived her usefulness, just like past campaign mgrs.
783751618001010689 2016-10-05 19:32:01 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried What was the official count for Trump interruptions during the last debate?
783750983973240832 2016-10-05 19:29:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @davecatanese To him, freedom of speech only applies when it reflects positively on him.
783750120940703744 2016-10-05 19:26:04 UTC <balder_ryan> @LaxSportsNet Will you be providing coverage from the Nicholas Colleluori Classic at JHU on Sunday?
783696819209592833 2016-10-05 15:54:16 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey I see the Trump campaign continues to inspire the best and the brightest.
783637844820656128 2016-10-05 11:59:56 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Unless of course it's Trump doing the interrupting.
783498959511756800 2016-10-04 02:48:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @MarkDice But Pence is the running mate, not the presidential candidate.
783498194286178304 2016-10-04 02:45:00 UTC <balder_ryan> @realDonaldTrump @politico Depends on the day and the audience.
783497505543692288 2016-10-04 02:42:16 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey His twitter feed alone is a constant reminder of why that's impossible.
783494313422520321 2016-10-04 02:29:35 UTC <balder_ryan> @chrislhayes Any Trump administration will pursue 'Trump policies'.
783489506074918912 2016-10-04 02:10:29 UTC <balder_ryan> @mmurraypolitics Pence has created fictitious running mate.
783485348114526209 2016-10-04 01:53:58 UTC <balder_ryan> @baseballcrank @EWErickson The same way Trump supporters can't defend Trump's record without attacking Hillary.
783482963212337153 2016-10-04 01:44:29 UTC <balder_ryan> @FrankLuntz Unlikely.
783480965599559681 2016-10-04 01:36:33 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey He is definitely winning the debate so far, but I keep reminding myself Trump is still on the top of the ticket.
783474963005177858 2016-10-04 01:12:42 UTC <balder_ryan> @charliekirk11 It's just too bad that he chose to align himself with Trump.
783473273665417216 2016-10-04 01:05:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @jbarro Same here!
783026048103542792 2016-10-03 19:28:52 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Every time I think he cannot sink any lower in my opinion, he finds a way.
782366937225555968 2016-10-01 23:49:48 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey Not according to Trump logic- the only accurate polls are the ones which show him with large lead.
782285961682161664 2016-10-01 18:28:02 UTC <balder_ryan> @seanhannity @declanpgarvey + Opportunistic hypocrite

782228318657675265 2016-10-01 14:38:58 UTC <balder_ryan> @declanpgarvey I feel the same way. The warning signs have been obvious since he first announced his candidacy.

767810928725352448 2016-08-22 19:49:25 UTC <balder_ryan> @Evan_McMullin Great to see you speak to variety of media. Unlike other candidates, you're not afraid to speak unscripted #StandUpWithEvan
767808532599177219 2016-08-22 19:39:54 UTC <balder_ryan> @Evan_McMullin Or domestic policy.
767454092310577153 2016-08-21 20:11:28 UTC <balder_ryan> @realDonaldTrump @RealBenCarson @FoxNews It's sad how Carson continues to compromise all of his principles to support Trump.
767452839341948932 2016-08-21 20:06:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @TheRickWilson @TeamMcMullin @JedediahGrant Based upon records, both Trump/Hillary should be disqualified. Evan's record speaks for itself.
767450243294199808 2016-08-21 19:56:11 UTC <balder_ryan> @beauhossler Great job Beau- happy to see!
767437123255402496 2016-08-21 19:04:03 UTC <balder_ryan> @TheRickWilson @TeamMcMullin This story has renewed my faith that an honorable and principled candidate can prevail. #StandUpWithEvan
766781444899209216 2016-08-19 23:38:37 UTC <balder_ryan> @Evan_McMullin Now that we have qualified conservative candidate, it's time for GOP to dump Trump and back Evan #DumpTrump #StandUpWithEvan
766618766268624897 2016-08-19 12:52:11 UTC <balder_ryan> @MBGlenn "Evan knows his away around foreign policy like Trump knows his way around bankruptcy laws." - My favorite quote from post.

765993038221107200 2016-08-17 19:25:46 UTC <balder_ryan> @kwilli1046 He already used the fundraiser excuse, for which some of the recipients are still looking for the money. What will he use now?
765991384096632832 2016-08-17 19:19:12 UTC <balder_ryan> @TeamMcMullin So much for Trump's claim to be surrounded by the 'best people'. #EvanMcMullin #IStandWithEvan

742004443873443840 2016-06-12 14:43:39 UTC <balder_ryan> @TaraSetmayer @evansiegfried Like Obama, he rewrites history to his favor, even with video evidence to contrary.

732018667949559808 2016-05-15 01:23:45 UTC <balder_ryan> @Reince @stoptrumppac Was strong supporter of GOP and yours until now. Trump is embarrassment to party and your leadership. #NeverTrump
731878934581743616 2016-05-15 16:08:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @CheriJacobus Just another sign of how corrupt and unlawful a Trump presidency would be. #NeverTrump

728212936850804739 2016-05-05 13:21:08 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried Hopeful for same.

725774309256474627 2016-04-28 19:50:54 UTC <balder_ryan> @evansiegfried In addition, considering the fact that if he is the nominee, Hillary will win by double digits based upon every poll.
725467855668568065 2016-04-27 23:33:09 UTC <balder_ryan> @WRGalivan3 @thedailybeast And to think, this is what we are potentially stuck with, after such a great field of candidates.

713574946572800001 2016-03-25 03:54:59 UTC <balder_ryan> @JacobBRichards1 Trump has reduced election to disgusting new low. With the high quality of initial candidates, minus Trump, sad to see.
713574110220197888 2016-03-25 03:51:40 UTC <balder_ryan> @JesseKellyDC I certainly hope you're right. Disgusted to still see him as frontrunner. #nevertrump

713439729979621376 2016-03-25 18:57:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @G_Humbertson Sadly Trump's supporters are basically cult followers who blindly follow everything he says regardless of fact or reality
713390095445962753 2016-03-25 15:40:27 UTC <balder_ryan> @G_Humbertson @natehollern23 Talk radio helped create it and media continues to perpetuate and strengthen it.

712715331031138304 2016-03-23 18:59:11 UTC <balder_ryan> @LindaSuhler Anyone supporting Trump after his vile attacks on Cruz's wife display ignorance & inability to think independently. #NeverTrump
712420073407913984 2016-03-22 23:25:56 UTC <balder_ryan> @ColeMcNeely His strategy as of this afternoon, this morning, or yesterday?
712080885835816960 2016-03-21 00:58:07 UTC <balder_ryan> @ColeMcNeely For ONCE, I agree with Warren, his actions say otherwise.

710301938236170240 2016-03-16 03:09:13 UTC <balder_ryan> @ColeMcNeely @natehollern23 A good read.

710197321263423488 2016-03-16 20:13:30 UTC <balder_ryan> @WRGalivan3 A strong likelihood of Rubio as running mate as well with Cruz or Kasich.
710099344750301184 2016-03-16 13:44:11 UTC <balder_ryan> @mikebowers So much for that 'unity' rhetoric.
710098640409198596 2016-03-16 13:41:23 UTC <balder_ryan> @WRGalivan3 @Ryan_N_Wiggins The ONLY positive result was that Kasich winning Ohio makes it much more unlikely Trump will reach 1,267.
709943440893673473 2016-03-15 03:24:41 UTC <balder_ryan> @WRGalivan3 Sorry to you so disillusioned and I understand exactly how you feel, but don't give up.

709577417329909760 2016-03-14 03:10:14 UTC <balder_ryan> @RiseToAmerica I  would say both...
709575223251697668 2016-03-14 03:01:31 UTC <balder_ryan> @mikebowers I have faith in Florida & Ohio remaining strong and rejecting Trump. #NeverTrump
709573615986073600 2016-03-14 02:55:07 UTC <balder_ryan> @donnasfineart @MamaBear4Cruz Sadly, he compromised his values and chose to support Trump, someone diametrically opposed to his  values.

705942643516305408 2016-03-04 02:26:56 UTC <balder_ryan> @FishmanLevine Think you have it backwards. A vote for Trump is vote for Hillary. He's ONLY candidate who loses to Hillary in 1:1 election
705930389462884353 2016-03-04 01:38:15 UTC <balder_ryan> @jbarro @JGreenDC It's impossible to know what he actually is. He changes positions daily. #NeverTrump

705570195654512640 2016-03-03 01:46:58 UTC <balder_ryan> @natehollern23 Curious why you don't like him, aside from personality. Thought he made most compelling argument against Trump presidency.

703423031855591424 2016-02-26 03:34:54 UTC <balder_ryan> @yourwhitefriend @FigDrewton Every poll says vote for Trump is vote for Hillary. Why do you think media is holding back on negative stories?
703422084945281024 2016-02-26 03:31:08 UTC <balder_ryan> @CatholicForDJT @FigDrewton So why are white nationalist groups and former KKK grand dragon saying it is obligation to vote for him...
