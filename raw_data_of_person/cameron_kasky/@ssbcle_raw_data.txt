891037313979097089 2017-07-28 20:47:04 UTC <ssbcle> @nypost @DianaLDAngelo1 Why are you are replying to the Post and talking about the Times, in response to a Post article?
890810044299698178 2017-07-27 05:43:59 UTC <ssbcle> @realDonaldTrump @WilcoMeThat Actually, with Mitch droning on about his sorrow of failing to kill millions of Americans, make it 3.
890808160923013120 2017-07-27 05:36:30 UTC <ssbcle> @realDonaldTrump @WilcoMeThat Twice even!
890807144731205632 2017-07-27 05:32:28 UTC <ssbcle> @SenJohnMcCain @EdanClay I second that. And I don't even care tonight why he did it. Just that he did!
890797763167789063 2017-07-27 04:55:11 UTC <ssbcle> @bobcesca_go I'll believe that when I see it.
890795561644826624 2017-07-27 04:46:26 UTC <ssbcle> @JackiSchechner To be really fair Jacki, it's also a big sloppy blow job for the Koch's and Mercer's. And their other overlords.
890792421432348672 2017-07-27 04:33:58 UTC <ssbcle> @ncsuenc @VABVOX I feel you guys. I have RA, sjogrens, psoriatic arth, hughes syn and Lupus. JFC, we are totally screwed.
890789992024363009 2017-07-27 04:24:18 UTC <ssbcle> @TopherSpiro @JordanRaeLake You may be right!
890789002290188293 2017-07-27 04:20:22 UTC <ssbcle> @rudepundit No kidding. And this week he's also shit all over HRC and come up with idiotic Dem "slogans". Banner fucking week.
890786923907657728 2017-07-27 04:12:07 UTC <ssbcle> @ReallyDontTrump @digby56 @BarbBarbBarbAR Yep, all of the above. And destroy the social safety net completely.
890777938110623745 2017-07-27 03:36:24 UTC <ssbcle> @ddiamond @pugbandit Don't count that out just yet, it's still early. Only 189 days in, so far. To be fair, it feels like 10 years.
890774674531131392 2017-07-27 03:23:26 UTC <ssbcle> @LeaBlackMiami @ddiamond @wvustephanie Not a goddamn one.
890769398176337921 2017-07-27 03:02:28 UTC <ssbcle> @chrislhayes @thismyshow Not surprised. But, it's only the beginning. Paul Ryan's wet dream won't be complete until his eugenics plan is fully enacted.
890768534527193088 2017-07-27 02:59:02 UTC <ssbcle> @bobcesca_go @caradox It's not every day that someone's bad grammar almost causes you to hear their cartoon voice because they match up so beautifully!
890766745530748928 2017-07-27 02:51:56 UTC <ssbcle> @chrislhayes @thismyshow Then, they'll come back for Medicare, then Social Security. You can bank on it

890760594697093120 2017-07-27 02:27:29 UTC <ssbcle> @nickconfessore @burgessev @Bblluueess1 Exactly. One of my Rx's is around $116k/year. Sure, no problem.     @senrobportman   Westlake, 44145
890732925939052544 2017-07-27 00:37:33 UTC <ssbcle> @senrobportman It's outrageous that your constituents have to call & beg for their lives / financial futures every single day. #FixACAhttps://twitter.com/SenKamalaHarris/status/890701330972639234

885144656417345538 2017-07-12 14:31:45 UTC <ssbcle> @bobcesca_go @BilliardLentil I second that. Happy birthday Bob!
882635373570121728 2017-07-05 16:20:46 UTC <ssbcle> @SenGillibrand Many autoimmune dis. since I was a kid. 1 Rx alone is 110k + yr. Caps, loss of pre existing cond. protections & Rx coverage will kill me.
880653235232571392 2017-06-29 05:04:27 UTC <ssbcle> @DGComedy Just catching up on today's @SMShow  Pence "gay as Christmas". Might keep me laughing for a few days, I really needed that!
879488730981126144 2017-06-26 23:57:08 UTC <ssbcle> @bobcesca_go Thanks Bob, now I have to poke out my mind's eye...

878852218090401793 2017-06-24 05:47:51 UTC <ssbcle> @impeach_d_trump @factorbust Wrong again. By allowing waivers of essential health benefits, the bill also allows waivers of the ACAs ban on lifetime and annual limits.
878839053956808704 2017-06-24 04:55:33 UTC <ssbcle> @impeach_d_trump @factorbust You are certainly wrong. When my insurance caps out. I will not have health care. Pretty simple.
878753021865455616 2017-06-24 23:13:41 UTC <ssbcle> @KillerMartinis And every single one of those union members would probably make a better Sec. Of Education than Betsy DeVos.

878066762939609088 2017-06-22 01:46:44 UTC <ssbcle> @SueinRockville Sue, you need to add mass murderer to that. Trump care is straight up murder.
878044845243219968 2017-06-22 00:19:39 UTC <ssbcle> @janeeucraft @JohnOberg Just plain evil.
877727520296239104 2017-06-21 03:18:42 UTC <ssbcle> @RussSwall I thought it was terrible.
877274251161743360 2017-06-20 21:17:35 UTC <ssbcle> @aravosis Me too. Caps will kill me in just a few short years, thanks to outrageous $$ for biologic meds.

874332801277022214 2017-06-12 18:29:18 UTC <ssbcle> WTF people!  I've had no trouble leaving messages for my GOP Senator. Why aren't people making calls to stop #Trumpcare
873932907416604672 2017-06-11 16:00:16 UTC <ssbcle> @olgaNYC1211 @robportman @JimRenacci I was born with multiple autoimmune diseases. With caps back, I'll b dead in just a few years. 1 med alone 110k+/ yr

860610120945999873 2017-05-05 21:40:16 UTC <ssbcle> @mikefarb1 @RepJimRenacci used his bout with cancer in campaign literature for his Congressional run. For sympathy?! Voted for #Trumpcare

837064401396117505 2017-03-01 22:17:59 UTC <ssbcle> @irishchck I understand. I lost my mom 3 years ago. Her personality was bigger than life & I miss her every day.
836258378775212032 2017-02-27 16:55:09 UTC <ssbcle> @irishchck So very sorry for your loss...Hugs to you.
835926356257030144 2017-02-26 18:55:48 UTC <ssbcle> @chezpazienza @bobcesca_go Just devastating. Can't adequately express how much I'm going to miss his brilliant insight. Sorry for your loss.

826296627220594688 2017-01-30 05:10:42 UTC <ssbcle> @ErinLOLiver @RiskyLiberal @erinLOLiver If Congress doesn't impeach this week, I'm afraid we're screwed. Bannon & Co grabbing power rapidly.
826181572659466240 2017-01-30 21:33:31 UTC <ssbcle> @chezpazienza re Fuck Steve Bannon, great piece, I concur. If congress doesn't do something this week, I  think we're truly fucked!
