970381406470901762 2018-03-04 19:32:10 UTC <WJRhino> @SophiaPA29 I agree with you that it's not TERRIBLE, but Armie Hammer is 31, and I think the age shows in a film like this. I know many people found Elio to have the "power" but I still felt that Oliver takes advantage of Elio, especially when we get to the ending phone call. Still love it!

932354601650741248 2017-11-19 21:07:14 UTC <WJRhino> Why isn't @TomiLahren calling @realDonaldTrump a snowflake because he expected a thank you for doing his job?

932271273086013441 2017-11-19 15:36:06 UTC <WJRhino> North West's custom made Jimmy Choo sneakers that @KimKardashian introduced on Snapchat last night are worth more than my human life.
932254282103033856 2017-11-19 14:28:35 UTC <WJRhino> I hate how much of an impact Jersey Shore had on me.

889320275338252288 2017-07-23 03:04:11 UTC <WJRhino> .@mariaplotkina I just read that ellaria is going to be cersei's gift so she can (likely) torture her for what she did to myrcella.
889319975101636608 2017-07-23 03:02:59 UTC <WJRhino> @nlinphoto @mariaplotkina I'm not sorry bout it
889316789947117568 2017-07-23 02:50:20 UTC <WJRhino> @mariaplotkina RIGHT. I easily would have worn his outfit from last week. Like wtf
889315359089725442 2017-07-23 02:44:38 UTC <WJRhino> @mariaplotkina Tru. I thought he was gonna encounter melisandre and get the fire arm a la Victorian
889314608493854720 2017-07-23 02:41:39 UTC <WJRhino> Does anyone else have the feeling that Sansa is going to be killed off this season?
889308978794180608 2017-07-23 02:19:17 UTC <WJRhino> My friend keeps referring to Asha as Yara and quite frankly I'm disgusted.
889308771884949505 2017-07-23 02:18:28 UTC <WJRhino> I find it hard to enjoy Game of Thrones. I could deal with a different plot, but these characters are so 100% different.

889307501866385408 2017-07-23 02:13:25 UTC <WJRhino> Theon spent like 3 years being tortured and abused? How on earth is he supposed to defeat his uncle. He's going back for Asha to be surehttps://twitter.com/DeadlyDiva/status/889304259724029953
889307165403512833 2017-07-23 02:12:05 UTC <WJRhino> @mariaplotkina I just. Asha is in the frozen North. Sansa is in the vale. Victorian and Arianne exist. I just. *over #it*

830947357084749824 2017-02-12 01:11:02 UTC <WJRhino> Beyonc is so powerful her name literally autocorrects to include the accent mark.
830946774760189953 2017-02-12 01:08:44 UTC <WJRhino> Beyonc defined history.https://twitter.com/Variety/status/830946301986512896

822464161791770624 2017-01-20 15:21:51 UTC <WJRhino> Reading @POTUS tweets and crying. I can't believe this is real. Life is about to get worse for millions and better for 5 billionaires.

820826459283525632 2017-01-15 02:54:12 UTC <WJRhino> I think a desperate need for constant attention is ENDEARING unlike what all of my friends say.

820253947411779584 2017-01-14 12:59:15 UTC <WJRhino> It frustrates me that people call Donald by his preferred name "Trump." Names/associations have power. Take his away. His name is Donald.

807618377955024896 2016-12-10 16:10:00 UTC <WJRhino> I do love Emma Stone but that doesn't mean the movies she's in have to appeal to me!
807617976807682050 2016-12-10 16:08:25 UTC <WJRhino> My desire to see La La Land or whatever that #WhiteNonsense is less than zero.

801428114937151488 2016-11-23 14:12:07 UTC <WJRhino> As much as I love celeb gossip, shouldn't the FBI be investigating our Russian hacked election instead of Brad Pitt?

801141506623082496 2016-11-22 19:13:14 UTC <WJRhino> The great irony here being that Donald claimed Hillary was crooked and rigged the election when he literally had Russians rig the election

799084849780944896 2016-11-16 03:00:49 UTC <WJRhino> When @KylieJenner said it was the year of realizing things no one knew she meant we had to realize that this was the year America ended.
799075409027547137 2016-11-16 02:23:18 UTC <WJRhino> I hope all those bullshit "give Donald a chance" supporters know that his recent appointments have blown through about 50 chances

762094572856107008 2016-08-06 01:14:39 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess only reason grand central is worth anything at all is to take this pic tbh

760666947906314241 2016-08-02 02:41:47 UTC <WJRhino> Trump is a legitimate threat to this country. Hillary, at worst, has policies disagree with and at best can enact major democratic change.
760666415003234307 2016-08-02 02:39:40 UTC <WJRhino> By actively not voting for Hillary, you are tacitly approving what Donald Trump stands for.
760665555678429184 2016-08-02 02:36:15 UTC <WJRhino> Why can't ppl see that not voting for Hillary is like saying, "It's totally okay that Trump could ravage my country, because I don't care."
760548054650986496 2016-08-02 18:49:21 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh bless your heart.

758098403456942080 2016-07-26 00:35:18 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess I literally drew inspiration from that Kendall calls herself a model post today
758098191866822657 2016-07-26 00:34:28 UTC <WJRhino> When it's been 17 1/2 minutes and you have the fear of God himself in you but then you get a text back 
757778638679007232 2016-07-25 03:24:40 UTC <WJRhino> I always forget that i can't post crazy shit to FB. Gotta keep that shit on Twitter where it belongs :)
757751741433733120 2016-07-25 01:37:48 UTC <WJRhino> Me @ myself: CALMTHEFUCKDOWN

757355974428680192 2016-07-24 23:25:09 UTC <WJRhino> Why is there no #KUWTK tonight 
757328114846429185 2016-07-24 21:34:27 UTC <WJRhino> Hits you with that triple text so you know I'm 3x as angry and 10x crazier than you thought:) :) :) :)

757093562077020160 2016-07-23 06:02:25 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh I followed all the rich kids on insta today. Greatest decision.
756913590796488704 2016-07-23 18:07:17 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess I'm not proud and left halfway through because I'm insane 
756912251425157121 2016-07-23 18:01:58 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess OMFG I just realized. I HATE you 
756912044759191553 2016-07-23 18:01:08 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess huh?

756149296001679360 2016-07-21 15:30:15 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess because I love that song or other shady reasons?
755513253548134401 2016-07-19 21:22:51 UTC <WJRhino> I feel bad for trump's wife. As if she prepared for this. Her husband's idiocy isn't her fault.
755209590099279872 2016-07-18 01:16:12 UTC <WJRhino> today has been wild.
755018650738798592 2016-07-18 12:37:28 UTC <WJRhino> The fact that @kourtneykardash stayed in her lane this entire time proves why she's my favorite.
754883402747314176 2016-07-17 03:40:02 UTC <WJRhino> @KimKardashian OMFG. I'M DYING.
754882973950996480 2016-07-17 03:38:20 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh OMFG KIM RELEASED THE VIDEO ON HER SNAPCHAT
754856054966644736 2016-07-17 01:51:22 UTC <WJRhino> The only person who still talks about Taylor and Kanye at the 2009 VMA awards is Kanye himself. The rest of the world really has moved on.

753545118905405444 2016-07-14 11:02:11 UTC <WJRhino> Who knew that Calvin Harris was actually a fuck Boi in disguise???
753376332449447936 2016-07-13 23:51:29 UTC <WJRhino> I wish my roommate weren't actually leaving nyc because I'd like to stay as his roommate 
753062152127275009 2016-07-12 03:03:02 UTC <WJRhino> Bernie endorsed Hillary. I am living for this moment.

750896868813578240 2016-07-06 03:38:59 UTC <WJRhino> I'm being peak petty right now 
750512807284793344 2016-07-05 02:12:51 UTC <WJRhino> It's honestly so rude when people post on  social media but won't return a text. BITCH IT'S 2016 LIKE YOUR PHONE ISN'T IN YOUR HAND 24/7 
750398123567120385 2016-07-05 18:37:09 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh this feels like a direct attack on me
750303054604464128 2016-07-05 12:19:22 UTC <WJRhino> Why does the 4th do me so dirty every year. 
750173055641587716 2016-07-04 03:42:48 UTC <WJRhino> Idk why I insist on day drinking when that hasn't worked out well for me in like 4 years

750015551137865728 2016-07-04 17:16:56 UTC <WJRhino> @myfaircatie I feel like you're one of the few who liked my instagram pic because it was Kris Jenner and not the 4th of july. 
750014367811379204 2016-07-04 17:12:14 UTC <WJRhino> Is my roommate's girlfriend really turning the stove on right now 
750007802043727874 2016-07-04 16:46:09 UTC <WJRhino> Whoever said you can't by class has clearly never bought proseco for 8 dollars.  my milf money.

749769625097932800 2016-07-03 00:59:43 UTC <WJRhino> In a world of hate, compassion is a sign of strength.
749764922549145600 2016-07-03 00:41:02 UTC <WJRhino> I wish I had a dollar for every snapchat I've had to look at of someone on a plane telling me how many mph they're going.
749649194856640512 2016-07-03 17:01:10 UTC <WJRhino> I'll do whatever the Kardashians tell me to do tbqh. 
749642030826020864 2016-07-03 16:32:42 UTC <WJRhino> I think the highlight of my night last night was when M.I.L.F  $ came on and I lost my shit. #GutterTrash

745034342095790080 2016-06-20 23:23:23 UTC <WJRhino> my aesthetic is the stark banner hanging over winterfell again.
744683402562048000 2016-06-19 00:08:53 UTC <WJRhino> Sometimes I remeber that I watched a video of Kourtney eating a kit kat and I'm just so blessed to live in the Internet era.
744677370951512064 2016-06-19 23:44:55 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh how do I sign up to be involved in a Kardashian hijink? These prosthetics are insane. 
744676650923790336 2016-06-19 23:42:03 UTC <WJRhino> @alhoey remember when we watched that God awful Blake lively movie about drug dealers? The Shallows is giving me the same vibe. 
744597565027520512 2016-06-19 18:27:48 UTC <WJRhino> I hate when my friends do dangerous shit in their snap stories. Be careful friends! #LoveYou #UghYouKeepMeYoung 
744546437036388352 2016-06-19 15:04:38 UTC <WJRhino> Looking @ your snapchat story from last night and you were a real messy bitch but people have seen it so there's no point in deleting. 
744341835301134336 2016-06-18 01:31:37 UTC <WJRhino> @B_Opulent sweetie that was hours ago :)
744287362918809600 2016-06-18 21:55:10 UTC <WJRhino> I regret how many mistakes I'm going to make tonight and it hasn't even started. #SluttySaturday us coming for me.

742217850383958016 2016-06-12 04:51:39 UTC <WJRhino> My life could be described as "whoops"
742169707801939968 2016-06-12 01:40:21 UTC <WJRhino> Kk nvm Jaime saying he only wants cersei ruined it
742168807779774464 2016-06-12 01:36:47 UTC <WJRhino> If someone doesn't refer to Jaime as golden hand the just I'm going to die.
742137702745804800 2016-06-12 23:33:11 UTC <WJRhino> Bangs. Yikes.
742112670237745154 2016-06-12 21:53:43 UTC <WJRhino> Books are the backbone of my existence.
742049151467147264 2016-06-12 17:41:18 UTC <WJRhino> How frequently and deeply I cry over a book is how I determine it's value because I'm crazy.
742019022812774400 2016-06-12 15:41:35 UTC <WJRhino> I want to thank not only God but also Jesus for people who like my instagram photos day in and day out. #YoureTheRealMVPS
741631604590845952 2016-06-11 14:02:08 UTC <WJRhino> Growing up is an illusion. I still only want to watch Disney movies and take naps.
741317448167784448 2016-06-10 17:13:47 UTC <WJRhino> When your boss catches you snapchating 
740390422019747840 2016-06-07 03:50:07 UTC <WJRhino> Just texted the squad. I can feel #SluttySaturday happening already.
740301583091699712 2016-06-07 21:57:06 UTC <WJRhino> I physically cannot read any book with the title "The Girl ____ _____ ______" #Enough
740001429876842498 2016-06-06 02:04:24 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh it costs  $0 dollars to love yourself and $20 to wax your brows.
740001085440593924 2016-06-06 02:03:01 UTC <WJRhino> I don't get why celebs won't spring for the  $20 eyebrow wax. #LookingAtDaveFranco
739985583607566337 2016-06-06 01:01:26 UTC <WJRhino> I identify so much with @KardashianReact because I too am insane. :)

739812584191315968 2016-06-06 13:33:59 UTC <WJRhino> My work spouse hasn't come in to the office yet and I'm freaking out.

739630890737893376 2016-06-05 01:32:00 UTC <WJRhino> Sansa Stark is embarrassed and cast aside in her own fucking story arc. How am I still surprised.
739201301137985537 2016-06-04 21:04:58 UTC <WJRhino> Just took a 3 hr nap and I'm not even sure who I am anymore. 
739100611732443136 2016-06-04 14:24:52 UTC <WJRhino> I'm obsessed with the sense8 cast tbh

737072094765297664 2016-05-29 00:04:16 UTC <WJRhino> I wouldn't be alive without @Persephhh validating my life via social media.
736928953328373760 2016-05-29 14:35:28 UTC <WJRhino> Off to a BBQ! #MDW
736721885011005441 2016-05-28 00:52:39 UTC <WJRhino> @JacquelineHoey @Persephhh crying.
736687362814705664 2016-05-28 22:35:28 UTC <WJRhino> Watching people drag their friends is so heart warming
736674329258295297 2016-05-28 21:43:41 UTC <WJRhino> I don't leave my apartment any other weekend. Why start now? #MDW
736228777622179841 2016-05-27 16:13:13 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess when sledgehammer comes on. 
735668159680778240 2016-05-25 03:05:31 UTC <WJRhino> The @Persephhh that doesn't give a fuck is just so amazing.
735591798849056769 2016-05-25 22:02:06 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh @sid_notthesloth Sidney what is your snapchat. I'm dying of anticipation
734924582843494401 2016-05-23 01:50:49 UTC <WJRhino> Any Kardashian: We defend each other. Two minutes later: What a stupid fucking bitch. #ILoveThem
734920901557420032 2016-05-23 01:36:11 UTC <WJRhino> Seeing random shots  of Mason and Penelope makes me so happy.
734919102070960128 2016-05-23 01:29:02 UTC <WJRhino> I just am so happy watching the Kardashians. For 1 hour a week I just get to see rich people with non-problems.
734916416554565632 2016-05-23 01:18:22 UTC <WJRhino> I feel like the recurring characters (doctors/stylists) in the kardashians' life are so interesting.
734912843598958596 2016-05-23 01:04:10 UTC <WJRhino> Catching up with Keeping up. 
734496061331476481 2016-05-22 21:28:01 UTC <WJRhino> I wish I had Kourtney's ability to stay in my own lane.
734491423022714880 2016-05-22 21:09:36 UTC <WJRhino> Someone once said millenials weren't professional because our speech has changed because of the kardashians and I was, like, sooo offended 
733897769702690816 2016-05-20 05:50:38 UTC <WJRhino> Being bat shit crazy since 2009 is how I operate.
733716612499529728 2016-05-20 17:50:46 UTC <WJRhino> Is it inappropriate to snap chat your coworkers selfies when they are down the hall and then tweet about it? #QuietFridays
733642974110883841 2016-05-20 12:58:10 UTC <WJRhino> Loving the Kardashians is not a crime, and I refuse to feel bad about myself for it.
732041116133003264 2016-05-15 02:52:57 UTC <WJRhino> Viciously fights people I've known for years about Sansa Stark.
731962220754702338 2016-05-15 21:39:27 UTC <WJRhino> I love Kardashian theme days. Today's theme: Rob's struggles.
731719701643046912 2016-05-14 05:35:46 UTC <WJRhino> Bucket list goals completed: vomiting in an olive garden parking lot
731710211954769920 2016-05-14 04:58:03 UTC <WJRhino> Noting screams "I don't have my life together" like being at the times Square subway stop at 1 am.
731690025574862848 2016-05-14 03:37:50 UTC <WJRhino> When your at the party but you need a minute so you jam out to Selena Gomez for  hot sec and let life happen to you 
731610794429980673 2016-05-14 22:23:00 UTC <WJRhino> In the wonderful world of #FredrikBackmam #ManCalledOvehttps://twitter.com/goodreads/status/731582394185175040

731527846313758720 2016-05-14 16:53:24 UTC <WJRhino> Teenage me wasn't angsty enough to listen to pop punk. why did i like it so much?
730903115365486595 2016-05-12 23:30:56 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh @L__Rose @B_Opulent can we please reunite a destination vacation soon?
730884656808267776 2016-05-12 22:17:36 UTC <WJRhino> @htisman sometimes I forget my coworkers follow me on twitter!! 
730788351045976064 2016-05-12 15:54:54 UTC <WJRhino> Me: Does something inappropriately crazy. Me: Is not shocked. 
730719836767174658 2016-05-12 11:22:39 UTC <WJRhino> Kylie and Tyga break up aka 18-year-old no longer in relationship that began as rape.
730718375186472960 2016-05-12 11:16:51 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh happy 8 yrs of Facebook friendship.
730573000190377984 2016-05-11 01:39:11 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh I can't believe we watchb#RichKids when people won't even pick up their calls.
730195257623781376 2016-05-10 00:38:10 UTC <WJRhino> When you're finally getting around to reading #AManCalledOve from @AtriaBooks and you cry the entire second half 
730183793403961344 2016-05-10 23:52:37 UTC <WJRhino> Sometimes I forget that my coworkers don't have to like me so I probably shouldn't tell them embarrassing things I do
730119792322068480 2016-05-10 19:38:18 UTC <WJRhino> @dunkindonuts Summer = @DunkinDonuts iced tea all day every day!! #LifeGoals
729844496595324928 2016-05-09 01:24:22 UTC <WJRhino> When everyone you've ever met is engaged and having babies and you're contemplating if a potted plant is too much responsibility 
729494438267990017 2016-05-08 02:13:22 UTC <WJRhino> I'm a good person. Why does game of thrones keep happening to me
729486210842935296 2016-05-08 01:40:40 UTC <WJRhino> How did Mace Tyrell get back to westeros so quickly??
729486091829579781 2016-05-08 01:40:12 UTC <WJRhino> When Game of Thrones forgets plot lines it started that they invented... :/
729457351460294657 2016-05-08 23:45:59 UTC <WJRhino> These 1 hit wonders of the 90s are so wonderful.
729447913567494144 2016-05-08 23:08:29 UTC <WJRhino> Pandora station currently playing: Alanis Morissette, so I know mom would be proud. #MomHitStations
729407804629454848 2016-05-08 20:29:07 UTC <WJRhino> The boy who cried I can't so much that when he really couldn't no one believed him. #MillennialFairyTales
729061237934460928 2016-05-07 21:31:59 UTC <WJRhino> I need. a goddamn. donut.
729054816358518784 2016-05-07 21:06:28 UTC <WJRhino> I accidently took a screen shot of an old coworkers snap chat selfie and now I'm praying for death
729046754688159748 2016-05-07 20:34:26 UTC <WJRhino> I am so petty.
729029503431872513 2016-05-07 19:25:52 UTC <WJRhino> I ran a 5k and now I want to die
728769513022427136 2016-05-06 02:12:46 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess obvi. #MPreg
728769308982185984 2016-05-06 02:11:57 UTC <WJRhino> @B_Opulent @L__Rose all I can say to that is YIKES
728768617689534464 2016-05-06 02:09:12 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess what does that even mean
728685501968986112 2016-05-06 20:38:56 UTC <WJRhino> Rob Kardashian having a child is giving me life
728401312497451008 2016-05-05 01:49:40 UTC <WJRhino> Sense8 is one of the best shows out there right now.
728391146544758784 2016-05-05 01:09:16 UTC <WJRhino> I forgot that Sense8 literally had a male pregnancy thing. This show was is so wild.
728321653315407872 2016-05-05 20:33:08 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess I don't understand
728298825857835013 2016-05-05 19:02:25 UTC <WJRhino> I'm a simple boy who likes iced tea with extra lemon and never staying in my own lane. 
728070444868317184 2016-05-04 03:54:55 UTC <WJRhino> @MrJW595 I see that.  #DinoVDino

728060588287508480 2016-05-04 03:15:45 UTC <WJRhino> I'm watching Jurassic World for Bryce Dallas Howard  to understand from dinosaurs in heels. 
728058466611429377 2016-05-04 03:07:19 UTC <WJRhino> The awful moment when you just know Trump is gonna be our next president 
728057455356284929 2016-05-04 03:03:18 UTC <WJRhino> Trump is going to be our next president and I just want death.
728049290174730242 2016-05-04 02:30:51 UTC <WJRhino> Chris Pratt is so dull actually.
728023475873550336 2016-05-04 00:48:17 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh I wanna believe we're Kourtney but we have never once stayed in our lanes in our entire lives. 
728013165435490304 2016-05-04 00:07:19 UTC <WJRhino> If I ask for a Chinese character tattoo that says "dirty slut" do you think the artist would actually make it say "Peace"???
727316992420634624 2016-05-02 02:00:58 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh omg. The Rob proposal. I cant.
727313371071168514 2016-05-02 01:46:35 UTC <WJRhino> I watched the preview clip 30 times but watching Kris yell at Kim for being married for 72 days was great. Like it's a joke for them
727312899799154690 2016-05-02 01:44:42 UTC <WJRhino> Kim has NEVER had any chill with Rob.
727311594187792386 2016-05-02 01:39:31 UTC <WJRhino> I aspire to be Kourtney. She's so great.
727304114170945538 2016-05-02 01:09:48 UTC <WJRhino> Kylie's dog is dressed nicer than I am.
727303723643457536 2016-05-02 01:08:15 UTC <WJRhino> Omg. Katching up on the Kardashians.  Scott's stuff is so sad. I wish he would get himself together and get his family back 
727300192085618688 2016-05-02 00:54:13 UTC <WJRhino> Idk why I'm not famous. I sold my dignity  online.  According to the kardashians  I should be set.
727091654495199232 2016-05-02 11:05:33 UTC <WJRhino> @mariaplotkina last night's ep had a lot wrong but also a lot right

726962138661670912 2016-05-01 02:30:54 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh tonight is the premiere
726960975149187074 2016-05-01 02:26:17 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh I know I'm the only one who watches #RichKids anymore but that guy has gotten so much surgery like bruh
726953330589732864 2016-05-01 01:55:54 UTC <WJRhino> 
726948113798275073 2016-05-01 01:35:11 UTC <WJRhino> This show is so dull honestly.
726943644201136128 2016-05-01 01:17:25 UTC <WJRhino> Why do I watch this?
726941032718450689 2016-05-01 01:07:02 UTC <WJRhino> Lyanna  Stark!!!!!
726940753159700480 2016-05-01 01:05:56 UTC <WJRhino> @GameOfThrones  where is Sam? Where is little finger?
726937931412287488 2016-05-01 00:54:43 UTC <WJRhino> I'm outraged that I have to watch Game of Thrones so I know what people are saying instead of #KUWTK which is what I really want.
726921099800416256 2016-05-01 23:47:50 UTC <WJRhino> Every book has some sort of value. You just have to find it. 
726795157576757248 2016-05-01 15:27:23 UTC <WJRhino> Boozy brunch with @lindsay_newton #NYCBetches #ChampagneIsLifr
726579571521404928 2016-04-30 01:10:43 UTC <WJRhino> My fav thing about working in publishing is that I'm friends with only 30+ yr old women.
726519143579705344 2016-04-30 21:10:36 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess I am not a frigging phase.
726504057511247872 2016-04-30 20:10:39 UTC <WJRhino> So glad @KeshaRose released #TrueColors so we can all get dirty drunk this summer. #Poppin
726473178067918848 2016-04-30 18:07:57 UTC <WJRhino> Silver linings? No thanks. I'd prefer silver tequila.
725845767378882560 2016-04-28 00:34:51 UTC <WJRhino> My Facebook is practically run by a 45 yr old woman.  Tacky quotes, wine jokes, and  memes.
725828872026120192 2016-04-28 23:27:42 UTC <WJRhino> Surrounded by fake bitches.
725817303670120452 2016-04-28 22:41:44 UTC <WJRhino> Kardashian vacation episodes are you favrite. They're in paradise and starting so much drama. 
724432729228582913 2016-04-24 02:59:56 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess I literally @'d you
724430055636656129 2016-04-24 02:49:19 UTC <WJRhino> @angelfishess i'm feeling so attacked right now.
724429458959151104 2016-04-24 02:46:56 UTC <WJRhino> @GameOfThrones after watching the premiere episode of season six I've decided I've never been more disrespected in my ENTIRE LIFE.
724412612440678404 2016-04-24 01:40:00 UTC <WJRhino> Fight the urge to be salty about how game of thrones is garbage on Facebook. Rise above it.
724409273447493633 2016-04-24 01:26:44 UTC <WJRhino> 
724406186905329664 2016-04-24 01:14:28 UTC <WJRhino> 
724398561715183616 2016-04-24 00:44:10 UTC <WJRhino> @Persephhh  us https://twitter.com/KardashianReact/status/724397423662002176

704037894307061760 2016-02-28 20:18:09 UTC <WJRhino> this year hasn't been real. I am really starting to believe that the earth is flat, ted cruz is the zodiac killer, and that Kanye is god.
704034470639378433 2016-02-28 20:04:32 UTC <WJRhino> What are the chances trump will just die before the election? @ god.

702688058337005569 2016-02-24 02:54:23 UTC <WJRhino> @lndsyrgn Hanya Yanagihara. It's a 720 page piece of art. But it's devastating. Be prepared to be emotionally drained.
702685226795982848 2016-02-24 02:43:07 UTC <WJRhino> @lndsyrgn a little life. It's so unbelievably good, well written, and heartbreaking

699057261415702529 2016-02-14 02:26:53 UTC <WJRhino> I love when  a Kardashian is like, "How could this possibly happen?? I have no idea how this situation occurred!" When its their fault.
