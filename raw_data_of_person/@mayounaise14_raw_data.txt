964313996009418753 2018-02-15 01:42:27 UTC <mayounaise14> Also, corncob? Cob of corn? Corn on the cob? Ear of corn? Cornea? Who knows?
964313335599542272 2018-02-15 01:39:49 UTC <mayounaise14> I always feel really powerful when I break a corncob in half.
945920718306287618 2017-12-26 07:34:08 UTC <mayounaise14> Half of my life is spent resetting forgotten passwords
926748903927508992 2017-11-04 09:52:11 UTC <mayounaise14> I don't like dancing in clubs, but I do like dork dancing for twenty minutes in a restaurant.
926344573747568641 2017-11-03 07:05:31 UTC <mayounaise14> Me: Questions the need to attend classes
926343417541435392 2017-11-03 07:00:56 UTC <mayounaise14> Amazing, but also Deakin what's up?
926269083804344321 2017-11-02 02:05:33 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc @rosesrowan Yes yes I know :) That was aimed at Paris.
926268305588985856 2017-11-02 02:02:27 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @69mgc I mean, yes that does make him racist and homophobic. Slurs don't stop becoming slurs because the person saying them didn't mean any harm.
926267799240024065 2017-11-02 02:00:27 UTC <mayounaise14> That feeling when you've written your essay in lots of different segments and they don't seem to go together but then you find an amazing...pic.twitter.com/hVIdz72tNK
926256675501125634 2017-11-02 01:16:15 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc Both
926256452854935552 2017-11-02 01:15:22 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc Somehow you're 13, 19 and 70 at the same time
926254864845357056 2017-11-02 01:09:03 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc How has it taken this long?!  Sincerely, the girl who takes more than 12 hours to reply to a tweet
926253350722600961 2017-11-02 01:03:02 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc This is what I have become. Just kidding, I've always been like this.
926040203952660481 2017-11-02 10:56:04 UTC <mayounaise14> You know you're tired when you refer to Winston Churchill as 'Winnie' in your head whilst writing a History essay.
919821767228645381 2017-10-16 07:06:13 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol Thank you. I appreciate the support 
919821138909282304 2017-10-16 07:03:43 UTC <mayounaise14> Tagged by @roschmol. This was so hard. I have so few photos on my phone.pic.twitter.com/93yegU9l2b
896159956218421248 2017-08-11 00:02:38 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol okay that's good
896159588667371520 2017-08-11 00:01:10 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol but also perhaps less stress for next time as well?
896159511290851329 2017-08-11 00:00:51 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol I'm sorry I only just saw it and then replied and then realised it was too late. I am glad the stress is now over
896156710842138625 2017-08-11 23:49:44 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol I'm pretty sure you can see the word count excluding headers and footnotes and stuff
892711179063140352 2017-08-02 11:38:25 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @roschmol @69mgc And I'm sure that can apply to many other situations
892711066739761153 2017-08-02 11:37:58 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @roschmol @69mgc Whereas Buzzfeed made sure to include POC, because there were a significant amount of POC there
892710892051111936 2017-08-02 11:37:17 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @roschmol @69mgc Eg. The reporting of the protest I went to in Canberra. Many news sites only showed the white students there
892710723754668032 2017-08-02 11:36:36 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @roschmol @69mgc Going out of your way to promote diversity can even make your reporting less biased at times
892698592493817856 2017-08-02 10:48:24 UTC <mayounaise14> I still find it amusing that Cadbury has trademarked the colour purple :')
892572182991192064 2017-08-01 02:26:06 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol @69mgc In my dream I remember being aware how ridoculous I was being and blamed it on PMS
892562169228738560 2017-08-01 01:46:18 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol I was anticipating this reply :') I was so angry in my dream that I had been given less garlic bread than everyone else. Soooo angrryy
892511564409954304 2017-08-01 22:25:13 UTC <mayounaise14> My dream last night: rocky horror, me throwing a tantrum over garlic bread, trying to board a plane already in the air to look for water.

890038355538264064 2017-07-25 02:37:34 UTC <mayounaise14> Barista: How are you? Me: How much-? Barista: How are you? Me: good (but apparently as awkward as usual)
889773062245175297 2017-07-25 09:03:23 UTC <mayounaise14> I forgot how tiring uni was.
889626846907645952 2017-07-24 23:22:23 UTC <mayounaise14> On the bright side. I won't be late to uni. Luckily there was a different route I could take which only made me a bit later. I had tissues.
889626366722932736 2017-07-24 23:20:28 UTC <mayounaise14> First day of uni. Bus arrived 6 mins late so missed the 2nd bus which Courtney was on by 1 minute. Got on a different bus. Spilled porridge.
889346587180138496 2017-07-23 04:48:44 UTC <mayounaise14> Why am I so self conscious about running in public?  I just want to exercise. It shouldn't be this stressful.
889025718146838528 2017-07-23 07:33:43 UTC <mayounaise14> @juliettebaxter1 Aw miss you too. Was great being able to see you!
888636982569517056 2017-07-21 05:49:01 UTC <mayounaise14> Back in Melbourne and blown away by the weather. Also ready for a good night's sleep now that there aren't 7 other people in the same room.
886418764106915840 2017-07-15 02:54:36 UTC <mayounaise14> My room is 6 degrees right now, but I don't want to turn the heater on because I need to prepare for the coldness that is Canberra.
886418236119539712 2017-07-15 02:52:31 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol Stop trying to paint onions as being completely terrible. They have layers you know?
886406695638794240 2017-07-15 02:06:39 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol flavourrr
886401731873038336 2017-07-15 01:46:56 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol I don't have to imagine.
886401218804723712 2017-07-15 01:44:53 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc Thank you, thank you 
886396167612899328 2017-07-15 01:24:49 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc PARIS. Your nickname was Dracoella, not salmonella.
886204957577191426 2017-07-15 12:45:01 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @roschmol @69mgc Very fancy schmancy
879171547411341313 2017-06-25 02:56:45 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc hi Paris!!! nice to see u again!!
877495888398082051 2017-06-21 11:58:17 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan I was also watching videos of the Book of Mormon today

874792807591944193 2017-06-13 00:57:12 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol Thank you!
874785008388415488 2017-06-13 00:26:13 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol I will do it after my exam today!!
874778616021647361 2017-06-13 00:00:49 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol It's been on my list of shows to binge watch for ages but I've never gotten round to it. I think this may be the shove I need.
872704260470751233 2017-06-07 06:38:04 UTC <mayounaise14> You know when you see a picture of Dear Evan Hansen cookies and you want to cry? No? Just me?https://twitter.com/averyychapman/status/872529458711863296
872701892656193536 2017-06-07 06:28:39 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @69mgc Good luck!
872701503571582976 2017-06-07 06:27:07 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @69mgc Oh my. Such fraudulence. You were always very good at fluking things.
872700671769755648 2017-06-07 06:23:48 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @69mgc I am also concerned, but hope I have no reason to be. Oh Paris.
872700315308482561 2017-06-07 06:22:23 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @69mgc Real skill.
872699965335773184 2017-06-07 06:21:00 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @69mgc You can get experience by getting experience. I know of call centre jobs that don't require previous experience.
872699795525128192 2017-06-07 06:20:19 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @69mgc You need the context of the episode. He lies on his resume and says he can speak French. That is him speaking French.
872699523386163200 2017-06-07 06:19:15 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @69mgc As terrible as lying in your resume and job interview?pic.twitter.com/26da4853vw
872699167977517056 2017-06-07 06:17:50 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @69mgc So, she bali-d on you? 
872698875064205313 2017-06-07 06:16:40 UTC <mayounaise14> @rosesrowan @69mgc holy moly. I'm so shocked but also not shocked
872698686739890176 2017-06-07 06:15:55 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc oh my god Will they not realise that you have no call centre experience when you get on the phones? 
872698064980410368 2017-06-07 06:13:27 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc pARIS, what did you lie about? 
870917918946582532 2017-06-03 08:19:47 UTC <mayounaise14> How has winter only just started? I've been cold for months.
865032003703287809 2017-05-17 02:31:15 UTC <mayounaise14> Crying again because of @AgentsofSHIELD. What a shocker.
863300819067617280 2017-05-13 07:52:09 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol Aw, Schnoodle. Semester break is coming! Then you will have free time and we can hang out a bunch and life will be Good.
862935339194695684 2017-05-12 07:39:52 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol I just keep getting the ad with Ellie Goulding pronouncing Pantene strangely
861854933212999681 2017-05-09 08:06:43 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol muhahaha
861850490946048000 2017-05-09 07:49:04 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol No takesy backsies
861848919617150977 2017-05-09 07:42:49 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol I got your back

861499532550393856 2017-05-08 08:34:29 UTC <mayounaise14> I used to hate the taste of onions, now I love it. I guess my taste buds have layers
861494054202122241 2017-05-08 08:12:42 UTC <mayounaise14> When you reach uni, indecisiveness is just called options.
860640066464612352 2017-05-05 23:39:16 UTC <mayounaise14> @doddleoddle This jumpsuit is super cute! Also the shoes. Also you
860412927752327168 2017-05-05 08:36:42 UTC <mayounaise14> @AgentsofSHIELD is constantly breaking my heart.
860328645121916929 2017-05-04 03:01:47 UTC <mayounaise14> "I love referencing," said no uni student ever.
860326426775437312 2017-05-04 02:52:58 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc Getting rid of toxic friends is a step forward though.
860326145157246976 2017-05-04 02:51:51 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc Which is obviously not easy, but just try not to shift the blame on yourself when you know it's someone else's fault. Again, not easy.
860325779489423360 2017-05-04 02:50:24 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc Yes, it's helpful to work on knowing where that line is, but don't be too hard on yourself. Just remember to take care of yourself.
860309358806159360 2017-05-04 01:45:09 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc You're not weak, you're compassionate and it's wrong of people to take advantage of that.
860297963725176832 2017-05-04 00:59:52 UTC <mayounaise14> I can't recall a time when I haven't been writing this history essay.
858132672786321408 2017-04-28 01:35:47 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol Are you sure you're not just having a shower?
858132307873456128 2017-04-28 01:34:20 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol Rochelle, tell your hair to get a grip
858129276675043328 2017-04-28 01:22:17 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol hahaha I just pull my hair up into a ponytail, twist it, wrap it around like a bun and tuck the end into the bun
857924742875013121 2017-04-28 11:49:32 UTC <mayounaise14> Like, impending doom is near and you're trying to tell them that but you have to keep stroking their egos.
857924524490186752 2017-04-28 11:48:40 UTC <mayounaise14> Convincing people in the Framework that they're not real is like trying to convince climate change deniers that climate change exists.
857922522599129090 2017-04-28 11:40:43 UTC <mayounaise14> Every episode of @AgentsofSHIELD since it's become Agents of Hydra has been incredible.
857907957064900608 2017-04-28 10:42:50 UTC <mayounaise14> Perks of having long hair: Being able to put your hair into a secure bun without any hair ties or bobby pins.
857581046535118854 2017-04-27 13:03:49 UTC <mayounaise14> @EvanEdinger Did someone call for me?
857465610082467841 2017-04-26 05:25:07 UTC <mayounaise14> I'm just going to have to accept that this green food dye is never coming off my hand, aren't I?
857375896130306048 2017-04-26 23:28:37 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol Oh $well
857139736212885505 2017-04-26 07:50:12 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol Oh no why. Can't you just pick it up at the store that is so much closer? Oh well, employment!!
857138791542345730 2017-04-26 07:46:27 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol Yay!! Travelling to Mordialloc was worth it :')
857138346119884800 2017-04-26 07:44:41 UTC <mayounaise14> I bought three tops from the op shop today. All three were floral and two were mint green. Classic me.
856749440236896256 2017-04-24 05:59:18 UTC <mayounaise14> Constantly struggling with whether I need to reply to emails from important people just to thank them or if should leave it.
854944351054471169 2017-04-19 06:26:32 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol Oh jeez. He's a mness
854943351199588352 2017-04-19 06:22:33 UTC <mayounaise14> @roschmol This whole lecture sounds like a mess, but what I'm most curious about is how he pronounced Hiroshima 
853463852922449920 2017-04-15 04:23:33 UTC <mayounaise14> You know that feeling when you want to go out and do something just because you have scrapbook paper that perfectly matches the activity? 
853213545827229696 2017-04-15 11:48:55 UTC <mayounaise14> @acejhyo @Lenacoladas @roschmol @69mgc I don't think I could forget 
853207580138536960 2017-04-15 11:25:13 UTC <mayounaise14> @acejhyo @Lenacoladas @roschmol @69mgc Yes of course! Teeth. All of the teeth as well as all of the awkwardness and cringing.
852455528076726272 2017-04-13 09:36:50 UTC <mayounaise14> If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.Then when you've failed for the third time, try again and you'll get mediocre caramel popcorn.
851051739889287170 2017-04-09 12:38:41 UTC <mayounaise14> @69mgc @roschmol Yes it has lifted a weight off my chest. Sorry to disappoint, Paris
851051075125649408 2017-04-09 12:36:02 UTC <mayounaise14> @Lenacoladas @roschmol @69mgc Yeah I decided I was thinking too much about it and it was too much pressure
850967313536897024 2017-04-09 07:03:12 UTC <mayounaise14> @Lenacoladas Okay good. There's no need for me to get down about it then
850966745137336320 2017-04-09 07:00:56 UTC <mayounaise14> @Lenacoladas I messed up with season two instead of part two and I'm just sitting here feeling ashamed
850965556278591488 2017-04-08 06:56:13 UTC <mayounaise14> @Lenacoladas I will soon!
850965287096557568 2017-04-08 06:55:09 UTC <mayounaise14> @Lenacoladas I get that 'wanting to tell the world about your love for a tv show' vibe from "WATCH THE GET DOWN SEASON 2" 
850963952393535488 2017-04-08 06:49:51 UTC <mayounaise14> hahah I just felt so strongly about it and needed to tell the world
850949376755224581 2017-04-08 05:51:55 UTC <mayounaise14> I love Superstore so much. Holy moly
