I think we should celebrate the ideas of who we are, no matter how rooted in fiction and impermanence they are in themselves. I think the ideas of us get a bad rap.
969045102327992320 2018-02-28 03:02:11 UTC <courtney_maye1> Do u ever just want to feel interesting? I think it's okay to admit & know you have layers and layers to you. and to have someone be intrigued and notice your history and philosophies and sadness and hope is something that solidifies the existence of the idea of you.

942966182872838145 2017-12-18 03:53:52 UTC <courtney_maye1> No amount of fake magical mystery could be worth the sadness in a materially poor parent's heart as they try and explain why or how santa gives different children different amounts of things when their kid is SO deserving of happiness
942965365780418560 2017-12-18 03:50:37 UTC <courtney_maye1> We tell kids across the country that if theyre nice they'll receive things? In a material-obsessed society this is so irresponsible.
942965204895145984 2017-12-18 03:49:58 UTC <courtney_maye1> Children don't understand the concept of money - but they are growing and trying to conceptualize self-worth
942964969536147456 2017-12-18 03:49:02 UTC <courtney_maye1> Nothing is worth the confusion on a materially poor child's face when he notices santa giving his friends at school mounds of gifts and they got close to nothing.
942964478811033601 2017-12-18 03:47:05 UTC <courtney_maye1> I seem like a fun sucker but i really want the myth and facade of santa to die in the firey pits of hell.

932651466673795072 2017-11-20 16:46:52 UTC <courtney_maye1> DON'T DONATE YOUR CLOTHES TO THEM. try to reuse them, make things from them, or donate them directly to the people in need of them, because they aren't actually being donated
932651395752316928 2017-11-20 16:46:35 UTC <courtney_maye1> it is actually causing them to become even more impoverished because its destroying their economy. since 1981, zambia's economy is down 40% because their clothing manufacturers can't compete with the prices, which in turn has caused employment to drop 50% as well
932651270829232128 2017-11-20 16:46:05 UTC <courtney_maye1> They take donated clothing and sell it to commercial dealers in africa by weight. the commercial dealers then sell them to vendors, who then sell them to people at ridiculously cheap prices. while that sounds like a good thing to give impoverished people access to cheap clothing,

928777625471979520 2017-11-09 00:13:36 UTC <courtney_maye1> @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian We're not saying it would be an overnight transition. Even if you don't care about the plight of animals, voting with your dollar to support animal agriculture over plant based lifestyles doesn't make any sense. For anyone but the owners of big animal agriculture.
928777342482337793 2017-11-09 00:12:28 UTC <courtney_maye1> @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian No there wouldn't be. Monsanto has less land and other agribussinesses planting crops are competing with concentrated animal feeding operations And crop fields that feed animals. More land, less need to create genetically modified plant foods
928776820455100416 2017-11-09 00:10:24 UTC <courtney_maye1> @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian People have been breeding more animals because....capitalism. even if we needed meat at All, we wouldn't need As Much as they are creating for us. They're a business. Sneaking their products into everything they can.
928776641215717377 2017-11-09 00:09:41 UTC <courtney_maye1> @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian No. There would be more food. Because we wouldn't be feeding most of it for animals. And look into it for yourself, we are.
928776172648923137 2017-11-09 00:07:50 UTC <courtney_maye1> @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian And of course marine fish and sea creature farming is different. But maybe, just maybe if we didn't fuck with the oceans in the first place mother nature would have taken care of it all just fine??

928775803986423808 2017-11-09 00:06:22 UTC <courtney_maye1> @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian These animals are literally artificially inseminated to make more of them. As with almost all animals bred for food

928773990969217024 2017-11-09 23:59:09 UTC <courtney_maye1> @theother_greg @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian But just because this is a reality, the solution is not to breed more life, waste, and unsustainable crop into the world. Much less advocate for it.
928773835738046464 2017-11-09 23:58:32 UTC <courtney_maye1> @theother_greg @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian Not everyone has the luxury and access to produce, and this is something that subsidies for animal products is directly impacting.
928773723137761280 2017-11-09 23:58:06 UTC <courtney_maye1> @theother_greg @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian Sustaining your own garden isnt the only way to support plant based eating and agriculture over livestock agriculture.
928773330576068609 2017-11-09 23:56:32 UTC <courtney_maye1> @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian But you need to feed animals a vastly large amount of food/crop AND water (not even including waste and water pollution in this equation), more than it would take to feed humans. ???
928772077267677184 2017-11-09 23:51:33 UTC <courtney_maye1> @theother_greg @carliflower_ @SuperSeyian Lol then I can't imagine why you'd think breeding animals to feed them throughout their lives just to kill them is sustainable??

913467879860969473 2017-09-28 18:18:08 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce Both imply black men and playboy bunnies have no body autonomy or autonomy at all.
913467847292149761 2017-09-28 18:18:00 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce I see men praising hugh hefner in the same light as white people saying black players should be fired from the NFL for kneeling.
913467281962946565 2017-09-28 18:15:46 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce "Ungrateful black millionaires" both stem from capitalism and body ownership and power dynamics that are gross. Both issues are real
913467067365494784 2017-09-28 18:14:54 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce Yes, just like we are force fed that playboy liberated women. The same concept of body ownership that leads tv anchors calling them,
913466762275979264 2017-09-28 18:13:42 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce Entertainment and sex work.
913466721499074560 2017-09-28 18:13:32 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce have always had financial, political, social power, we see black men being owned by them. The same thing with men and women in modeling and
913466521296437249 2017-09-28 18:12:44 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce I completely agree with you. And it's honestly white people's fault, who continue to ignore this. Just like white people
913465790980149249 2017-09-28 18:09:50 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce Than a sports team owner trading a player.
913465715507830784 2017-09-28 18:09:32 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce In some ways. But women, body autonomy, and the issues that stem from those being under male control are a bit more negatively impactful
913464528305819649 2017-09-28 18:04:49 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce True freedom is a woman being the main profit holder of her sex work. Then see hef, a man building a billion $ empire off of their bodies
913464085454495744 2017-09-28 18:03:03 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce How much choice do they actually have? When something like exploitation of women's bodies is seen as normal and isn't looked at critically?
913463442115317761 2017-09-28 18:00:30 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce If he was the one with the money, power, and control over their image and kept bunnies as possessions, we can't say that's a form of abuse?
913463285659373569 2017-09-28 17:59:53 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce If they want to pose, yes of course. But women's bodies were altered, changed, restricted and women were literally the property of dude.
913462257140584448 2017-09-28 17:55:48 UTC <courtney_maye1> @RonnieVyce I would say women are victimized into thinking that's about as much sexual liberation as they can expect. Conforming to the male gaze lol
913461552799518720 2017-09-28 17:53:00 UTC <courtney_maye1> So, in short, dont trust the men in your life who praise hugh hefner's legacy.
913461141384376321 2017-09-28 17:51:22 UTC <courtney_maye1> Sexual liberation but bunnies had to conform and alter their bodies for a certain image ??pic.twitter.com/qNy6ajYCHV

913092875449257985 2017-09-27 17:28:00 UTC <courtney_maye1> taking a knee was about calling out injustices against black americans and now we are to link arms with the same people who refuse to -

885605347607621632 2017-07-13 21:02:23 UTC <courtney_maye1> oh and make sure they take off the avacado ranch and low fat sour cream *sad face*
885605259435028480 2017-07-13 21:02:02 UTC <courtney_maye1> so this is romaine lettuce (better than their normal shredded), pico, black beans, guac, potatoes, rice, n they throw that ish on the grill
885604762338689026 2017-07-13 21:00:03 UTC <courtney_maye1> ANOTHER THING: veggie power burrito, take off the cheese (this burrito already has pico) and add potatoes (always 50 cents), add red sauce
885604318199652352 2017-07-13 20:58:17 UTC <courtney_maye1> so this ends up being lettuce, pico, rice, pinto beans, potatoes, guac, red sauce. it ends up being just over $3
885604186875985920 2017-07-13 20:57:46 UTC <courtney_maye1> (making something fresco style subs out the dairy products for pico)
885604102738202626 2017-07-13 20:57:26 UTC <courtney_maye1> ALSO: 7 layer burrito fresco style, add potatoes
885603916234317824 2017-07-13 20:56:42 UTC <courtney_maye1> so it black beans, pico de gallo, red sauce, rice, potatoes. wit da mild sauce. it's perfect and comes out to 2.61
885603676399833088 2017-07-13 20:55:44 UTC <courtney_maye1> vegans this is what i get at tbell n u have to try it: black bean burrito fresco style, add potatoes

800439762427478016 2016-11-20 20:44:45 UTC <courtney_maye1> @MatTagye i had an entire conversation with someone who replied to this tweet lol i think its still up
800389463016951809 2016-11-20 17:24:53 UTC <courtney_maye1> we're innovative enough to come up with creative financial solutions to any "problems" that arise with stopping mass hunting.
800389069565992960 2016-11-20 17:23:19 UTC <courtney_maye1> btw it costs money to prepare for hunting season the revenue they get isnt all theirs to keep for whatever.
800388416286429185 2016-11-20 17:20:43 UTC <courtney_maye1> @OliviaaBolivia omg following rn
800387305039020032 2016-11-20 17:16:18 UTC <courtney_maye1> @OliviaaBolivia smh
800384629085798400 2016-11-20 17:05:40 UTC <courtney_maye1> we're after if we make profit2 "protect"other things@ their expense.The role of the dnr should be 2 preserve nature.All of it.
800384208233381888 2016-11-20 17:04:00 UTC <courtney_maye1> every year. They are not financial resources to exploit to protect "other stuff". We cant act like preserving life is what
800384049877422080 2016-11-20 17:03:22 UTC <courtney_maye1> and if there isn't a need to control deer population like everyone suggests, there is no point in slaughtering 300,000+ animals
800383874106671104 2016-11-20 17:02:40 UTC <courtney_maye1> i didnt say that lol but there's enough effort going inpic.twitter.com/L8epde3XTH
800382757134331904 2016-11-20 16:58:14 UTC <courtney_maye1> animal populatiom doent just shoot up or down without severe intervention
800382664180019200 2016-11-20 16:57:52 UTC <courtney_maye1> to ensure there are large harvests every year.
800382598295986177 2016-11-20 16:57:36 UTC <courtney_maye1> the point of showing you that is the fact that the dnr gets money off this, they control and manipulate the population of deer
800382373753917440 2016-11-20 16:56:42 UTC <courtney_maye1> habitat alone as best we can. Not gaining profit to fix the problems caused by things WE have normalized
800381778678648832 2016-11-20 16:54:21 UTC <courtney_maye1> nature has been doing this w/o us for eons. the only wildlife management that should be done on our end is leaving animal
800381459102044161 2016-11-20 16:53:04 UTC <courtney_maye1> nature has been "managing" itself by  limiting factors such as available, food, water, shelter, and prey to predator ratios.
800379534964985856 2016-11-20 16:45:26 UTC <courtney_maye1> what other natural resources? The forests theyre clearing and unnaturally manipulating for a nine day hunt lol
800378873091424256 2016-11-20 16:42:48 UTC <courtney_maye1> the dnr specifically since they manipulate populations (an all year effort) and record it over time for hunting purposes
800378697945665537 2016-11-20 16:42:06 UTC <courtney_maye1> so that there are is an "overabundant" amount of deer for hunting season alone. It's hard to track the numbers from
800378421301936128 2016-11-20 16:41:00 UTC <courtney_maye1> deer populations for the growing amount of hunters looking for a kill. Habitats are annually cleared, changed, and manipulated
800378263248007168 2016-11-20 16:40:22 UTC <courtney_maye1> important to note his comments on the relationship between hunting and wildlife mngmt on manipulating
800377924532641793 2016-11-20 16:39:02 UTC <courtney_maye1> here's a blog from a hunter with cited sources about deer population going down in certain areas http://www.boblamboutdoors.com/bob-s-blog/266-there-are-plenty-of-reasons-as-to-why-wisconsin-s-deer-population-is-down
800377569543680000 2016-11-20 16:37:37 UTC <courtney_maye1> The dnr should do it's role in preserving natural resources not getting money from hunters for the benefit of hunterspic.twitter.com/aQkxdmFSZf
800377489235116032 2016-11-20 16:37:18 UTC <courtney_maye1> see animals aren't financial resources though lol. Their deaths shouldnt be seen as a for profit benefit
800373205043187712 2016-11-20 16:20:16 UTC <courtney_maye1> **stabilize lol
800372863056289793 2016-11-20 16:18:55 UTC <courtney_maye1> A lot of small towns rely on revenue from hunters. It isn't a population control thing it"s a local economy control thing.
800372754939834369 2016-11-20 16:18:29 UTC <courtney_maye1> and an increase in the permits for hunting deer predators (wolves, coyotes, etc.) so numbers will stabalize.
800372698094387201 2016-11-20 16:18:16 UTC <courtney_maye1> deer population has gone down dramatically in the last 10 yrs.So much that there has been game relocation during hunting season
800368931542274048 2016-11-20 16:03:18 UTC <courtney_maye1> @kara_es4 is this a population control comment
800219630296039424 2016-11-19 06:10:01 UTC <courtney_maye1> I just think pretty, living deer are so much nicer than the shit i'm seeing on the back of trucks and in pics lately
