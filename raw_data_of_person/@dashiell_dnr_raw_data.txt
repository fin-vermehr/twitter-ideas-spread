822670167784058880 2017-01-20 05:00:27 UTC <dashiell_dnr> But even in that, it's not about winning. It's about creating a world that is good to live in, and makes no one suffer.

822669296551792644 2017-01-20 04:56:59 UTC <dashiell_dnr> About it. I talk to them. Cause that's how we make change. It isn't until we put down our biases and leave our baggage at the door,
822669131358957568 2017-01-20 04:56:20 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Opinions, I disagree with others. It happens often. Hell, it happened today. But if I want to talk to some one I don't go on and sub-tweet-
822668856992956416 2017-01-20 04:55:14 UTC <dashiell_dnr> And republicans are, I knew that I'm a democrat and republicans are wrong. But here's the thing. Speaking now as someone with developed-
822668667427045377 2017-01-20 04:54:29 UTC <dashiell_dnr> But people are treating politics like it's sports teams. And have taught their children so, that before I understood what democrats-
822668461616734208 2017-01-20 04:53:40 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Y'ALL ARE ACTING LIKE A BUNCH OF MIDDLE SCHOOLERS. I mean, everyone talks about getting stuff that they want done,
822668267726651392 2017-01-20 04:52:54 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Ambition. This is what I deal with. And I have gone about my life believing that people mature as they age. But to the country I say-
822668027720269824 2017-01-20 04:51:56 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Say I need to take a chill pill cause I'm passionate. Call me a bitch and a cunt for knowing what I want and how to get it and having-
822667798056833024 2017-01-20 04:51:02 UTC <dashiell_dnr> -to the question, WHY MUST WE MOVE IN BABY STEPS? 2) I am in middle school. I am surrounded by people who make fun of me for caring-
822667533874364416 2017-01-20 04:49:59 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Finally, someone I thought could prove that I really can be whatever I want as a woman. And I know I can, but after this, I keep coming back
822667323094028288 2017-01-20 04:49:08 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I have grown with this election. In sixth grade @HillaryClinton launched her campaign. And I was immediately inspired.
822667070047326208 2017-01-20 04:48:08 UTC <dashiell_dnr> But speaking as an LGBT youth, I can't bear to watch this happen.
822666788034977792 2017-01-20 04:47:01 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I know I do not have it the worst. There are people for whom this election has been so much worse than I can imagine.
822666610586554370 2017-01-20 04:46:19 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Today I wept, and thought about the future of this country that I love. That I trusted. That I wish loved me back.

822665918383652865 2017-01-20 04:43:33 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I have grown so much, as a person and in physical height while he was in office. This man is one of the many reasons I want to get involved-
822665677412700161 2017-01-20 04:42:36 UTC <dashiell_dnr> (This might be a long one, so stick with me.) For the last eight years I have had a wonderful president to aspire to be like. To look up to.

806658857971781632 2016-12-07 00:37:13 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Life tip no.1, practice self care. If you don't, you will inevitably have a mental breakdown in the middle of the hallway at school.
804528760410095616 2016-12-01 03:32:58 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @mermaideleh Did a great new vid.  it's nice to hear from someone I really look up to that she's looking out for kids like me.

798327224705257472 2016-11-14 00:50:17 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Remember to take care of yourself. You can't fight fascists if you aren't doing doing self care.

796505461138681856 2016-11-09 00:11:14 UTC <dashiell_dnr> A small thought. We do not want this. But if we cannot stop it, we cannot take it out on each other. It is important that we stay together.

778736221736480768 2016-09-21 23:22:38 UTC <dashiell_dnr> So we're at rehearsal and for check in we told people about our challenges and we're all crying and yep.
778396929734512640 2016-09-20 00:54:24 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @mermaideleh go to the dramatist book store.
762452335335309313 2016-08-07 00:56:17 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I was playing scrabble with my mom when I suddenly shout, "Read and read are the same word!"
762178910511517696 2016-08-06 06:49:47 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I started watching @mermaideleh s new video within 1 minute of it going up.

760197356117594112 2016-08-01 19:35:48 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @Lin_Manuel I'm in a production of the Scottish play and we are Nonstop singing that one part of Take a Break.
759503616403046400 2016-07-30 21:39:07 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I love eating good food with my family. It is one of the better parts of life and is a break from this weird world we live in.
758880668130566144 2016-07-28 04:23:45 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @CWWeir okay I have seen it.  Thoughts: HOW THE HELL DO THEY WANT ME TO WAIT!?!

758749823176577024 2016-07-28 19:43:49 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @CWWeir no!?!
758112022387003392 2016-07-26 01:29:25 UTC <dashiell_dnr> No matter of political stances, it's pretty damn cool we have our first female nomination for president.
757667946982322176 2016-07-25 20:04:50 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Menu items include The Mariah Reynolds Rap The Schyler Sliders  The Guns and Ship-shake (free if you can do the rap)
757666553735237632 2016-07-25 19:59:17 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Talk less. Eat more. (The restaurant that should be next to Hamilton.)
757595410768683015 2016-07-25 15:16:36 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Gmorning! I hope your day will have hope, optimism and chocolate.
755930226928910337 2016-07-20 00:59:45 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @ashleymardell Can @AshleyMardell please make a youth in LGBTQ+ community video?
755888660424171521 2016-07-20 22:14:35 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @JonaAlmostFame there is a part of the song that goes, Angelica, Peggy, Eliza, but yes, YOU are correct.

755253641288650753 2016-07-18 04:11:14 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @CWWeir good! Hopefully you'll get a little less busy.
755204744675667968 2016-07-18 00:56:56 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @CWWeir yup! And yours?
755161745375633408 2016-07-18 22:06:04 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @CWWeir I'll give E a death stare when I see him.
754881714103607296 2016-07-17 03:33:20 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @CWWeir I'm looking at Elliot.

748258464510574592 2016-06-29 20:54:54 UTC <dashiell_dnr> My brother eats incredibly fast and it is entertaining and that is all and goodnight.

747953818327932928 2016-06-28 00:44:21 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @mermaideleh true. Very true.
747282591749832705 2016-06-26 04:17:08 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I feel there should be an episode of GMW where someone questions their sexuality.
746900974472593412 2016-06-25 03:00:43 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Can I point out how wise this and he is?https://twitter.com/lin_manuel/status/746787810070364162
746896811432960001 2016-06-25 02:44:11 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @hopelessjen I love you guys so much. 
745849831554424832 2016-06-22 05:23:51 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @mermaideleh where are your comfy sandals from the witch kit video from?

745387400055054338 2016-06-21 22:46:19 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @mermaideleh do you have a P.O box?
745038549917925377 2016-06-20 23:40:07 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Listening to Getting Married Today and spotting the similarities between that and the rap in Into the Woods.
744367420442238977 2016-06-18 03:13:17 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I want to be able to favorite @Lin_Manuel 's bio all the time.
744276277297745920 2016-06-18 21:11:07 UTC <dashiell_dnr> And so the "Summer body" sh!t has begun. *sigh*pic.twitter.com/4BZWMvkRdP
743896471372599296 2016-06-17 20:01:54 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady oh cool!
743895645304434690 2016-06-17 19:58:37 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady yay! Yours will be better.
743681775067488257 2016-06-16 05:48:46 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady I like that one better.
743680248017883136 2016-06-16 05:42:42 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady yup. There are two pages of suicide jokes and not a single mention to Ophelia's madness.
743676873591267328 2016-06-16 05:29:18 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady yeah, like a full two of pages.
743630539375022080 2016-06-16 02:25:11 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady There's probably a little I missed. But that's most of it.
743630389919387648 2016-06-16 02:24:35 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady Hammie makes play, nunnery is in there somewhere, shows play, king prays, gravediggers, duel, good night sweet prince. 2/3
743629840809500673 2016-06-16 02:22:24 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady find ghost, tell Hammie about the ghost, show Hammie the ghost, Hammie is moody, Hammie talks to Rosie and Guildy,1/?
743286750735306753 2016-06-15 03:39:05 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady nah. There really isn't much about the duel. Like you don't hear about the poison until Gertrude is like hey, it's poisoned.
743272923390058496 2016-06-15 02:44:08 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady that's what I thought too.
743269217013739520 2016-06-15 02:29:25 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady there are a couple moments, but I only have the four scenes that are full.
743268854181224448 2016-06-15 02:27:58 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I'm writing very angry "poetry" about Orlando. I feel things.
743255455779028992 2016-06-15 01:34:44 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady oh, cool!
743222047728250882 2016-06-15 23:21:59 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady Horatio.
743164772481306625 2016-06-15 19:34:23 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Sitting in a coffee shop & writing in my script. Such fun! (Not sarcasm)
742970704895807490 2016-06-14 06:43:14 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Sending love and support to Orlando. Being so thankful for the community I am lucky enough to be in. #trulygrateful sleep well.

742960787581456384 2016-06-14 06:03:49 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady polonius is stabbed. And there is no part of the mad scene. Also, this is our To be or Not to be.pic.twitter.com/Oi91ArJQqI
742956148723187712 2016-06-14 05:45:23 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady yup.
742955761886744576 2016-06-14 05:43:51 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @bardic_lady oh, and Ophelia never gets a mad scene. It's nunnery then she dies.
742954988826136576 2016-06-14 05:40:47 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @mermaideleh @bardic_lady about forty minutes. Rosy and Guildy are not cut. They just don't die. They are in other scenes silently.
742951428994502656 2016-06-14 05:26:38 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @mermaideleh @bardic_lady and saying "goodnight sweet prince". 3/3
742951086219272196 2016-06-14 05:25:16 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @mermaideleh @bardic_lady I lied. Four. They include, finding the ghost, telling Hamlet about the ghost, showing Hamlet the ghost 2/?
742950652394000386 2016-06-14 05:23:33 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @mermaideleh @bardic_lady in short, Hamlet never goes on the trip, the nunnery scene is cut into smithereens & Horatio has three scenes.
742934695822938112 2016-06-14 04:20:09 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I feel @mermaideleh would sympathize with my anger at the cut of the Hamlet I'm in.
742436135880663040 2016-06-13 19:19:03 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @Lin_Manuel can I point out how Portland is amazing?pic.twitter.com/gRLGKRCMPC

742211615144042496 2016-06-12 04:26:53 UTC <dashiell_dnr> I love that I even the bow in @Hamilton musical shows how everyone is incredibly important in the show.
741016676552957952 2016-06-09 21:18:37 UTC <dashiell_dnr> @Lin_Manuel so I have friends who are flying in tonight just to see the show all the way from Oregon. Have fun with their energy.

734796470637858816 2016-05-23 17:21:45 UTC <dashiell_dnr> Pro tip: when taking tests listen to Hamilton. It makes you want to be as accomplished as both @Lin_Manuel and Alexander.
