942332241983803392 2017-12-17 09:54:48 UTC <riffyraffy1> @Rant3r There you go again with your ignorance. I told you. Let me try and explain this to you as simply as possible. Ranter, just because one coach, from one team, in one location hasnt suffered abuse, does not mean that others from different parts of the UK have not. Simple logic.
941054058315550720 2017-12-13 21:15:46 UTC <riffyraffy1> @Rant3r enjoy Ranter. YNWA

941041015087157250 2017-12-13 20:23:56 UTC <riffyraffy1> @Rant3r I hope you understand the point I was making. Maybe you should stick with footy instead of dabbling in politics... it seems youre too much of a snowflake for that kind of thing.
941039568802983936 2017-12-13 20:18:11 UTC <riffyraffy1> @Rant3r Just wanted to know... Where did you hear about white Christmas being offensive to some?... From The S*N?
