967131747342155776 2018-02-23 20:19:11 UTC <KrisLovesMina> How to know youre eating like a savage: desperately reaching for a drink to soften the ball of food you didnt chew long enough and is now stuck in your esophagus

966774660812582912 2018-02-22 20:40:15 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Was listening to the black panther album with the bf. Big Shot lyrics had us stumped, wondering how there could be peanut butter incest.   (Its peanut butter *insides*)
966611717345067009 2018-02-22 09:52:46 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray Oh yea! Wish I had a chance at a vip lion king tix in broadway at that price tho. (And Sorry I cant be your benefactress )
966565831856480256 2018-02-21 06:50:26 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray Depends on city. Im gonna say no less than $400. I just checked. Lion king mezzanine tickets in nyc is already $200+ for example.
966544937293459456 2018-02-21 05:27:25 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray Wow. I wish those VIP tix prices would translate to exactly currency equivalent in the US!

965637206684643328 2018-02-19 17:20:25 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @BookThingo And shes getting flak for it right? I totally get why. Its so unfortunate the show creators didnt take advantage of a show about pre colonial times to actually showcase they know the nuances of the subject. Or maybe they really dont
965567274118651905 2018-02-19 12:42:32 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Can someone break down the Liza Soberano story for me?

965295633560039424 2018-02-18 18:43:08 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Also these teens from Douglas HS speaking up giving me chills. I only watch a little of it. Otherwise Ill spend entire day crying.
965295333667295232 2018-02-18 18:41:56 UTC <KrisLovesMina> As far as I can sew together from snippets I read on twitter: Bernie was supported by the Russians, he wont release his taxes, hes the worst and so are his supporters. Did I get everything? Sometimes my head in sand news strategy works too well and sometimes I need to know

965250055471951872 2018-02-18 15:42:01 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Im a little confused how all the different people team up to have a hand in the costume design of a movie. Ruth Carter seems to be main costume designer. Regardless Black Panther fashion was lit 
965249144271990790 2018-02-18 15:38:24 UTC <KrisLovesMina> The concept designer for Black Panther is Filipino? Thanks for letting me know, Twitter!https://twitter.com/dosgranas/status/965042054018433024

963995307984920576 2018-02-14 04:36:06 UTC <KrisLovesMina> My only hope is that this country reaches a saturation point, elect officials who run on gun control platforms, so we can finally see change. Please please please.

962595839741894656 2018-02-10 07:55:07 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Ive always had a mild crush on Idris. Im a little disappointed he didnt fall for a seasoned woman. Late 30s at least. Just throwing that random number its not like its my age bracket or anything.

961628200261500928 2018-02-08 15:50:03 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert That movie suspends reality at a whole other level. And i cant remember what happened past original movie. But it did make me laugh. And was happy to see those two reunite.
961585499944054784 2018-02-08 13:00:23 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert just finished watching Dead Men tell no tales with the bf. Did you watch this movie just for her scene? Lol

954802610288017408 2018-01-20 19:47:36 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @MommyJJM Im so happy to you! Also pls do listen to the mix tape. It is amazing. Obsessed with both albums.
954603485198086148 2018-01-19 06:36:21 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I cant decide whether I love the original Satisfied or Sias version better #Hamilton
954603290200715264 2018-01-19 06:35:34 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Ive watched several musicals in my life. I have never been obsessed with any of them until now. Hamilton has me hooked. If youre a fan the mix tape version of the soundtrack is eargasm.
954203560899588096 2018-01-18 04:07:11 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Watching Definitely, maybe. Rachel Weisz is beautiful.
954202575024226305 2018-01-18 04:03:16 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @catrogue Not seen the original! But this does look good!

953025574762512384 2018-01-15 22:06:18 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @berrycar The good news is you live in Canada already! 
953025091402543105 2018-01-15 22:04:22 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @berrycar Rate in rest of US is double. Not meant to scare. If your daughter is a risk make sure you and She advocates for her health with her OB when time comes ((Hugs))
953024570239238144 2018-01-15 22:02:18 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @berrycar In my hospital we put them on prophylactic lovenox usually. Yes incision hematoma is a risk for c-sections but you can get transfused with more blood. You can die instantaneously from a PE. I love hospitals in Cali. Rate of maternal death here is comparable to Canada/Australia..
952866069043068928 2018-01-15 11:32:28 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @BookThingo @slamup Very very sad. Id say even with the differences between your birth experience and the one in my hospital for example, I would vouch your top notch care in a hospital in Cali, but couldnt say same outside of the state. Which shouldnt be the case.
952864228527947776 2018-01-15 11:25:10 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @slamup @BookThingo Im just gonna throw this in for kicks bc I have no audience on twitter or even my personal FB account. US maternal death rate is higher than many other developed countries! However Im proud to say Californias is much lower, and closer to Australia and Canadas rate.
952863184162996224 2018-01-15 11:21:01 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @slamup @BookThingo So with an epidural it doesnt take away the feeling of pressure. Without epidurals that breathing pattern is still used. With epidurals we tell patients to hold their breath and push for 10 seconds. Like theyre pooping 
952856850055151616 2018-01-15 10:55:50 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @BookThingo @slamup Well we figured it out. All comes down to $$. We wont even talk about the rate of c-sections here in the US. Lol
952856002377822208 2018-01-15 10:52:28 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @BookThingo @slamup Yes for sure. Its the insurance system. Australian taxes pay for their care I suppose? And no matter what kind of care they get, the hospital wont get paid more. And it cost them $ to induce, give IVs, use epidurals, pay a Doctor etc
952855423513542656 2018-01-15 10:50:10 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @slamup @BookThingo I think it stems from insurance. The more interventions imposed the more the hospital and OBs get paid. Inducing labor, IV, epidurals, meds, all cost $$. The cost to patient is same mind you bc of copays being a set number. But the hospital/OBs can charge insurance for all those.
952852720100130816 2018-01-15 10:39:26 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @BookThingo @slamup Thats crazy to me! Its so different! Moms here are always on IV. It gets started on admission. They wouldnt get dehydrated at all.
952851597591064577 2018-01-15 10:34:58 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Damn. The hospital and her OB of all ppl shouldve known her history of pulmonary embolism. And shouldve had her on prophylactic anticoagulant. All hospitals and care are really and truly not equal.http://www.skepticalob.com/2018/01/serena-williams-almost-becomes-a-maternal-mortality-statistic.html
952849588041302016 2018-01-15 10:26:59 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @slamup @BookThingo Yes it stuck with me, bc of the difference between births in Australia and here. Doulas are BYO here as well. No midwives (except nurse midwives but they are rare) have ANY hospital privileges here. They are seen as hacks by OBs.
952848954252713984 2018-01-15 10:24:28 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @slamup @BookThingo Hahah good point on epidurals and pain. Unfortunately bc epidurals are widely used, that position is just what OBs and nurses are used to. Its the default position even if theres no epidurals.
952847623504855040 2018-01-15 10:19:11 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @slamup @BookThingo I think Ive read your account Kat, of midwives attending births? And doulas presence? Midwife and doula attended births arent the norm here at all. And unfortunately the midwives here arent as educated/regulated as those from other countries. With nurse midwives as exception.
952846770899308544 2018-01-15 10:15:47 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @slamup @BookThingo Oh so thats the other thing, epidurals are used here in the majority of deliveries. Thats why the positions so prevalent. Even in births Ive attended with no epidurals, its still the position used. Some womens hospital and some OBs try other positions. Its a rarity tho.
952839535309733888 2018-01-15 09:47:02 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @BookThingo @slamup Its sadly how its done in the US still. Theyre slightly elevated but yea essentially (Im an OB nurse).

952246784557858816 2018-01-13 18:31:39 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Saw Hamilton last night. Cant get over the talent it took to write that. And that we went from those men of intellect to this current cheeto in chief. Ill never get over both.
951850796827607040 2018-01-12 16:18:09 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I have an ebook I paid for that I just cant get myself to read more than a few pages of. Grrrr. Struggling. Hopefully will be able to finish soon and then settle on whats next to read.

I thought all medical professionals, like nurses are taught to listen to the patients assessment of their pain and not make judgments. Ive been a nurse long enough to know thats not the case.

940493170311229440 2017-12-12 08:06:59 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Watching Die Hard. John and the Stewardess exchange seductive looks. Now I know this is the male director projecting what he wants and what he believes other men want: to be desired by every attractive female.

935331667694141440 2017-11-27 02:17:01 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @sunflowergurl I liked her in Suits a lot. I also like that shes American, half black, and a divorce. And Harry didnt even blink. Hes like NBD, Ill introduce you to much family. I love it! Lol

929871475984625665 2017-11-12 00:40:10 UTC <KrisLovesMina> The BF about the Heussefs: they all kind of sound douchey to me 
929780315572248576 2017-11-12 18:37:56 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @buymoriaking Alabama is gross
929777107030310912 2017-11-12 18:25:11 UTC <KrisLovesMina> The Eusaffs are freaking good looking. And marrying other good looking people. All this new knowledge because I followed childhood idols and since then IG suggests more Filipino celebs.

928289612992094208 2017-11-08 15:54:25 UTC <KrisLovesMina> People need to stop complaining about the 280 chars. It wont go away unless people: complain loudly and never use it. Guess what? Ppl are using it. Its here to stay everyone.

I dont know where Im going with this, but it made me feel good that women in HWood keep having more outlets to create not backed by men 
928153716766654465 2017-11-07 06:54:24 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I like kind and compassionate Christians. And the replies to this thread are full of them https://twitter.com/andrewtwalk/status/928079632464785408

923948058517258240 2017-10-27 16:22:37 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I have a mild crush on a Filipino basketball player. At least on IG he looks like a good dad, husband, and he aint a butterface
923939936654344193 2017-10-27 15:50:21 UTC <KrisLovesMina> So true, texted the BF at midnight telling him to hurry up and come over ASAP today.https://twitter.com/televisionary/status/923930430264377344
923939456960233472 2017-10-27 15:48:27 UTC <KrisLovesMina> The sexual harassment ep was so prescient; the deaf POV, the Thanksgiving Denise episode. All so different from each other, and compelling
923939060636205056 2017-10-27 15:46:52 UTC <KrisLovesMina> BF and I finished Master of None few nights ago. Really  the different ep styles in s2, and appreciate how they highlight  social issues.

923080226594099200 2017-10-24 06:54:10 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Hopefully being a dad has reformed him.
923080204859215872 2017-10-24 06:54:05 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Scarlet is the child of a celebrity couple in Philippines, filthy rich even in American standards. The dad is a past douche.
923079681896718336 2017-10-24 06:52:00 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Confession: I follow scarlet snow belo on IG and Im not a fan of her parents but I think she + whoever posts for her are completely adorbs.

909650338587713536 2017-09-17 05:28:35 UTC <KrisLovesMina> She wasn't nominated, but she's in the right place. I'm very happy for her and the show.
909650170077315073 2017-09-17 05:27:55 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I remember her looking at camera (looking at me), and play of emotions on her face gave me goosebumps. And I said, she needs all the awards!
909649894750560256 2017-09-17 05:26:50 UTC <KrisLovesMina> She looks so lovely too!! Omg! I just remembered a scene in Chuck, where Rafe was holding Sarah hostage and then she like fell to ground
909649557037785088 2017-09-17 05:25:29 UTC <KrisLovesMina> It is absolutely thrilling to see Yvonne in an Emmy award winning show. Omg! Finally!
909649127352307712 2017-09-17 05:23:47 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I was about to tweet another outraged tweet but whatever. I'm just gonna take a pass and eat some chips.
909648516133281794 2017-09-17 05:21:21 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert Oh yay!!! Do watch it. Hope you like,
909648384566353923 2017-09-17 05:20:49 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @snickrz I'll check it out. Also, I love your profile pic
909329000115216384 2017-09-17 08:11:42 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @sunflowergurl Same old issues?
909328918305316864 2017-09-17 08:11:23 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @snickrz @d_emmerez @notqueuebert He looks like a mashup of Dornan and Joshua Jackson.
909326655427977216 2017-09-17 08:02:23 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @sunflowergurl Hmm from what I read everything will be rolled into the actual target app, but no date when.
909326241852940288 2017-09-17 08:00:45 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @snickrz @notqueuebert That's a perfectly clear comparison. I was really looking forward to Defenders. Give me JJ s2 pls.
909075804109205509 2017-09-16 15:25:36 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Plans: go home, have a good cry, and go to asleep.pic.twitter.com/NtAtGvbT6x
908928975279333377 2017-09-15 05:42:09 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @sunflowergurl Yea, they said something in the app and I ignored it. But I just saw a news article.
908914570298658816 2017-09-15 04:44:55 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert Man I have to suffer thru Iron Fist only to suffer more when I get to Defenders? Well, shit.
908914044525932544 2017-09-15 04:42:49 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Target Cartwheel loyalty program going away for good by October . Had no idea it was a pilot program in 5 cities only. Bye, perks!

907899420334735360 2017-09-13 09:31:04 UTC <KrisLovesMina> The BF is asking we watch IronFist. Watching first ep. It's so bad.

907121832544788481 2017-09-10 06:01:13 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Unpopular opinion: Had Mina listen to Beatles to widen her music repertoire. She didn't like it...as I listened I found I didn't either.

902052495785988096 2017-08-27 06:17:28 UTC <KrisLovesMina> All right, we tried to watch Defenders without finishing Luke Cage or watching Iron Fist at all. No comprende.

890586960372285440 2017-07-27 14:57:32 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert @StealingCake It's pretty sad. How hard is it to read a contract and let them find a home for him. Poor thing . Wonder if the little guy is ok.
890528160491610117 2017-07-27 11:03:53 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @StealingCake Q (@notqueuebert) posted something about Chris Pratt abandoning his dog. I just Googled it and it was pretty sadhttps://www.google.com/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4043794/amp/Anna-Faris-pays-5k-fine-emaciated-rescue-dog-homeless-five-years-Chris-Pratt-tried-cat-away-Twitter.html

890423392247070721 2017-07-26 04:07:34 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @Sepanie523 Comparison sucks the joy out of everything, don't do it! You're doing great!
890226988853542912 2017-07-26 15:07:08 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I just..cannot believe the state of things in this country. It breaks my heart and the end isn't near enough.

887453864919613440 2017-07-18 23:27:44 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @sunflowergurl Comic con just got a lot stricter with passes. Industry people started just getting their own, with opportunity to directly buy.
887453592029757440 2017-07-18 23:26:39 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @sunflowergurl My cous was considered industry. They got tix along with extras back in the day! After that through my Chuck website, I got press passes!
887334059189297153 2017-07-18 15:31:40 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Kidding! I'm Comic-Coned out. I had a good run tho. 8 yrs of free tix+1 yr bought (+ many memories, friendships and privileges) ain't bad.

884620128691924992 2017-07-10 03:47:28 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Lesson from Universal: after 4p front of the line upgrade is $49. Worth it. We zipped through everything like mofo VIPs.

880458257638113280 2017-06-29 16:09:41 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray I might not be being fair to Rachel!
880457877965611008 2017-06-29 16:08:10 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray Haha omg is she not a minor celeb. Well, she was not as nice as Lea that's for sure. Just remember I was 9-10 during these memories lol
880457136471367680 2017-06-29 16:05:14 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray Have no idea if you know Rachel Alejandro but she went to my school too and we had an interaction once. Iba yung other minor celebs. Yabang.
880456721927348224 2017-06-29 16:03:35 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray I don't have much else except she's always had a great reputation as being friendly and hindi mayabang. I left when I was 10.

880452732737409024 2017-06-29 15:47:44 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray She has great skin even now
880452628093612032 2017-06-29 15:47:19 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray I know he is and that's sad. Basta I'd be so insanely jealous and sad. But who knows maybe she adores Lea too. (Lea went to my elem sch!)

876763361274249220 2017-06-19 11:27:29 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @Aleveria My thought are with you. I'm very saddened to hear this. Hope it passes.
876234059722117120 2017-06-17 00:24:14 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I'm still thinking of the glimpse of Whedon's what could've been Wonder Woman script that I caught. We dodged a sexist bullet.
876185254192586752 2017-06-17 21:10:17 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @Sepanie523 It's terrible but hopefully a lot of it is just this one time purchase. Good luck!

863482029358276608 2017-05-13 19:52:13 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I'm excited about Defenders. The BF surprisingly isn't as. Probably bc he didn't love JJ as much as I did, and is dismayed at Iron Fist.
863480695842160640 2017-05-13 19:46:55 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Lmaooooo. It was a good one!https://twitter.com/tvtvElina/status/863332005467107328
863479026756628480 2017-05-13 19:40:17 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Hallelujahhttps://twitter.com/Variety/status/863102982505857024
863478580906414080 2017-05-13 19:38:31 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @minneapolisnice hope they didn't fall for it. Spiked or poisoned is my guess lol (I'm not even joking)
863478462224322560 2017-05-13 19:38:02 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Guys...I wouldn't swallow if I were youhttps://twitter.com/ddale8/status/863411698836885504
863477940352204800 2017-05-13 19:35:58 UTC <KrisLovesMina> This is fake news, come on! So cool!https://twitter.com/Iron_Spike/status/863033502152916994
863476873757458436 2017-05-13 19:31:43 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @mxpw999 omg baby groot really is too adorable to be killed! I hate that he's gonna be grown in the next one. Teenagers suck (for most part)
863466811303411712 2017-05-13 18:51:44 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @mxpw999 I always have a soft spot for originals, but the BF agrees with you.
863466450232553472 2017-05-13 18:50:18 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was as enjoyable as I hoped. Yay!
863466214512672768 2017-05-13 18:49:22 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @larcollins I think your guess is right
863316424474804224 2017-05-13 08:54:09 UTC <KrisLovesMina> What was the reason given for lack of nerdhq ? A lot of people's plans are sure gonna be thrown a wrench.
863065200072704000 2017-05-12 16:15:53 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Ugh healthy not hearty but whatevs
863064251274895361 2017-05-12 16:12:07 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert it's crazy how so many writers have trouble writing functional relationships lol
863063822025674752 2017-05-12 16:10:24 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert I'm hoping the latter confessions are just them having a bad day. Otherwise, yikes.
863063796314652672 2017-05-12 16:10:18 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert just a lot of lonely, cheated on wife and moms out there. And lots of moms who secretly hate their kids.
863062806869884928 2017-05-12 16:06:22 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Saccharine alert: I've landed myself one of those kind, considerate, nice guy. He makes me strive to be a kinder human.
863062324420034561 2017-05-12 16:04:27 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Discussing Jake and Amy romance that completely obliterates the moonlighting curse theory. More hearty relationships like this on TV pls.
863061123192336384 2017-05-12 15:59:41 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert Is this from the last epi? The double feature? And girl, I read this scary mommy confessions site. World is full of shitty ppl faking nice 
863022321656778752 2017-05-12 13:25:30 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Lollll https://twitter.com/race_jones/status/862842317983666176

862908223803629568 2017-05-11 05:52:07 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert So many writers believe they couldn't write a couple without the will they/won't they angst. Parks and Rec and B99 proves them wrong.

861995854164410368 2017-05-09 17:26:41 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Just a PSA that Black Mirrors on Netflix has Hayley Atwell, and Tuppence Middleton from Sense8. It's also a real mind fuck of a show.
861897879383756800 2017-05-09 10:57:22 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray no, don't say that. I'm watching this Friday and I don't wanna be

846091624278999040 2017-03-26 20:08:57 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I dunno why ppl deliver tweets that way. Is twitter really the best way for that kind of long messages? Whatever.

846078293900062720 2017-03-26 19:15:59 UTC <KrisLovesMina> My Mina was Rafiki in her theater camp's prodtn of the broadway version of Lion King. I just thought it was a meh role but wow! Was wrong!

844613827157123072 2017-03-22 18:16:43 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Sadly, I have lost a lot of my optimism that things will turn out well. Really hoping that the ACA doesn't get repealed. Dunno anymore tho.
844612271603036160 2017-03-22 18:10:32 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @notqueuebert shit

843772418258755584 2017-03-20 10:33:15 UTC <KrisLovesMina> The BF made a comment that Belle obviously developed Stockholm Syndrome and now I can't unsee it.

837058482650021893 2017-03-01 21:54:28 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I just watched Get Out. It was definitely less of a comedy than twitter tried to tell me lol
836823287137198080 2017-02-28 06:19:53 UTC <KrisLovesMina> My ostrich head in sand continues. Will not watch that cheeto's address. And there are no moments momentous enough to make him presidential.
836444770356477952 2017-02-27 05:15:48 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray omg so my bf was my watch buddy with the 100 and he's not spoiled at all. He keeps asking me when we're watching s3 
836440360897261568 2017-02-27 04:58:17 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray lol, I gave Arrow a chance and got so burned!
836439316742090753 2017-02-27 04:54:08 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray it's a turn around from when it was on CBS apparently
836438439553708032 2017-02-27 04:50:38 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray my friend is quite pissed
836438374030397440 2017-02-27 04:50:23 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @grace_viray did anyone reply to you yet? They've supposedly introduced a love story that's reduced Kara to a damsel in distress.
836364272712101888 2017-02-27 23:55:56 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @settleprecious awww that must've been difficult moment
836363968914440192 2017-02-27 23:54:43 UTC <KrisLovesMina> A good friend pointed out that I shouldn't cut ties over politics. But the thing is if they support Trump,I'm cutting ties over moral values
836363688214876160 2017-02-27 23:53:36 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Now their support of Trump is making it really easy to never want to see any of them again.
836363593301938176 2017-02-27 23:53:14 UTC <KrisLovesMina> And For many reasons I don't feel that affectionate towards my Dads family, one of them their Conservative leanings.
836363263755497477 2017-02-27 23:51:55 UTC <KrisLovesMina> My good friends brother is apparently neighbors and besties with Sean Spicer. And of course her brother is a Trump supporter. Yuck

822871856986222592 2017-01-21 18:21:53 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @StealingCake wow!
822841312596480000 2017-01-21 16:20:31 UTC <KrisLovesMina> This made me cry. I fucking love Obama and his wife so much. Please run Michelle. Imma be a citizen for you.https://twitter.com/C4Ciaran/status/822840612315611136
822840844147298305 2017-01-21 16:18:39 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Never Trump must be the battle cry against complacency in future elections from here on.
822840680347119617 2017-01-21 16:18:00 UTC <KrisLovesMina> With turnout like this I still, still don't understand how Trump won. Makes my head and heart hurt.
822839438283657216 2017-01-21 16:13:04 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Getting a lil emotional about the world over participating in Women's March. Please let it galvanize the same number of people into action.
822838314336030722 2017-01-21 16:08:36 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @VictoriaNoir89 I'm very sorry. How can someone like him have such an awesome daughter and cool wife. I don't understand (no offense)
822836521036173312 2017-01-21 16:01:28 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @VictoriaNoir89 he voted for Trump? 
822835979471831040 2017-01-21 15:59:19 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Will be thinking about all my badass friends attending today's women's march.

822477880672165888 2017-01-20 16:16:22 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @AyeTeaGuy 
822381824634589185 2017-01-20 09:54:40 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Bad grammar in a meme ruins whatever good message the meme has for me. You took so much trouble to give it a border and a photo, come on.
822366633167495168 2017-01-20 08:54:18 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Reading Lindy West's Shrill.Writes how much kinder ppl speak of fat people now vs 2011 & bf4. Srsly wonder if that was the Obamas' influence
822348091198050304 2017-01-19 07:40:38 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @clickmomukhamo stay safe to you as well. Yes, wettest January in memory. Or month period. Sigh.

821880329602355200 2017-01-18 00:41:55 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I want a Fitbit. I'm in denial it'll be languishing on my dresser 8 months after acquisition.

821393865949126656 2017-01-17 16:28:53 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Obama is really dreamy now that I think about it lol
821393772193796097 2017-01-17 16:28:30 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Going from a president who loves and respects his wife to...someone else. What a contrast.
821392773119033345 2017-01-17 16:24:32 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I hope contouring just a trend. Otherwise my cheekbones will never be defined enough.On the + side, before blending, the pics give me laughs

819323393342218240 2017-01-11 23:21:33 UTC <KrisLovesMina> "The moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice." Four years to keep repeating that to myself.
819321367535316992 2017-01-11 23:13:30 UTC <KrisLovesMina> no way in hell I thought we could go from Barack to Trump either. For Michelle I'd become a citizen just so I could vote.
819321157417435137 2017-01-11 23:12:40 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Stil haven't been able to watch both Obama's farewell speeches. I hope Michelle runs.Thought no way in hell she could win before..but Trump.
819043453849874432 2017-01-10 04:49:11 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I wonder if he has a heavy heart, leaving the country he's served so well to such orange hands.
818859284016467968 2017-01-10 16:37:21 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Man there's a "dark felicity" storyline brewing on Arrow?

776831530681315328 2016-09-16 17:14:04 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Hillary needs to win. Not even iOS 10 update and new iPhone 7 will distract me from how horribly it all went wrong if Trump gets elected.

773929789145001984 2016-09-08 17:03:35 UTC <KrisLovesMina> This latest Matt Lauer presidential nom interview highlights how little media holds Trump accountable, and how critical it is of women.

770707826851274752 2016-08-30 19:40:39 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Poke places (the fish, not the sexual stuff nor the one with mon at the end of it) are getting so popular here in SD.

770707273714835456 2016-08-30 19:38:27 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Regretting my choice not to get poke before heading home, even if I had to eat by myself. I forgot Twitter could keep me company.

760178644484358144 2016-08-01 18:21:26 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @minneapolisnice the fact is that article I RT'd brought up good points about repub/cons who abhor what trump is saying.
760178088542019585 2016-08-01 18:19:14 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @minneapolisnice Leslie I'm putting myself in a repub cons shoes. They'll never think like us
760138596363804672 2016-08-01 15:42:18 UTC <KrisLovesMina> For example, as an adult I've recently become enchanted with the world of steam mops and keyless security locks.
760137638854598656 2016-08-01 15:38:30 UTC <KrisLovesMina> K back to tweeting things of no consequence
760137030563094528 2016-08-01 15:36:05 UTC <KrisLovesMina> If I were a thinking and compassionate republican conservative, I'd vote HRC and vote like hell for a republican congress and senate

755340886297280512 2016-07-19 09:57:55 UTC <KrisLovesMina> There's a theory that Trump's setting this all up bc he's friends w/ the Clintons & wants to ensure a Hillary win.That'd explain all of this
755299456073904129 2016-07-19 07:13:17 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Seriously is the entire 2016 just an episode of some tragicomedy.

753259801740582912 2016-07-13 16:08:26 UTC <KrisLovesMina> The fact that Arrow is still doing pointless flashbacks is mind-boggling. If they're still doing it every ep that's just plain dumb.

750635287915565057 2016-07-06 10:19:33 UTC <KrisLovesMina> So Mr. Robot is pretty good. Maybe I can add that to my list of tv shows that for some mind-boggling reason numbers zero currently.
750635108651061248 2016-07-06 10:18:50 UTC <KrisLovesMina> And I now watch basketball. Am I even me anymore.
750634970964586496 2016-07-06 10:18:17 UTC <KrisLovesMina> I used to have a list numbering 11 shows that rotated in a given year, cause they had different premiers and finale dates. And now zero.

748695967994564608 2016-06-30 01:53:23 UTC <KrisLovesMina> When Fetty Wap talks about being in the kitchen, cooking pies with his baby, he apparently does not mean apple or blueberry pies.

748115510198317057 2016-06-29 11:26:51 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @sunflowergurl I actually prefer spf 30 min but I've been told some find their face feels like they just went to the pool from a moisturizer
748048266466627584 2016-06-28 06:59:39 UTC <KrisLovesMina> This would be perfect, except take out the greens and put veggies in it that's not actual veggies but ricehttps://twitter.com/mxpw999/status/748047742384087040

738576895508287489 2016-06-02 03:43:48 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Warriors should easily win these first 2 games against the Cavs.

736255894128758784 2016-05-27 18:00:58 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @ATTCares @ATTcares I guess customer loyalty means nothing. A supervisor can't even call me back. 15-30 wait. That was yesterday. Sorely disappointed.

695118460913893376 2016-02-03 05:35:30 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Let's focus on the shirtless part RT amellywood: It's not a season of Arrow until I'm shirtless on an exam table fighting for my life.
695036736708202498 2016-02-03 00:10:45 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Been wondering and wonderinghttps://twitter.com/DunneWriting/status/694998857806127104

695035585531088896 2016-02-03 00:06:11 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @mxpw999 but my preemie baby today was 6 lbs
694970778912165888 2016-02-03 19:48:40 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Have you ever been so tired that you end up eating an entire preemie-sized burrito, of which you only planned to eat half?....  Me neither
694968722453352450 2016-02-03 19:40:29 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Can't we just have a triwizard tournament. With a port key that takes Trump to Azkabanhttps://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/694967827078504449
694967828735254528 2016-02-03 19:36:56 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Taking a kitten nap. The much shorter and less satisfying version of a cat nap
694757925173096448 2016-02-02 05:42:51 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Just realized how behind I am on my currently airing shows. I miss not being busy 
694681816918167552 2016-02-02 00:40:26 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @happydayz3 @notqueuebert this sounds delish
694681564920176641 2016-02-02 00:39:26 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @_kaleidoskope I hope so. She was such a huge part of it. Watching GG would you ever have said MM will be bigger than Lauren and Alexis?!
694680432927838208 2016-02-02 00:34:56 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @_kaleidoskope she should just tweet her lol
694680388044591105 2016-02-02 00:34:45 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @_kaleidoskope that seems more like it
694680207811215360 2016-02-02 00:34:02 UTC <KrisLovesMina> Between last season and this, it's like "maybe you're better off as a fond memory"
694680047139946496 2016-02-02 00:33:24 UTC <KrisLovesMina> If ASP lied about in inviting MM to show, not endearing this Gilmore Girls revival to me
694679795863556096 2016-02-02 00:32:24 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @_kaleidoskope oh I didn't look at the date of MM tweet. This is weird.
694679440761053185 2016-02-02 00:30:59 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @_kaleidoskope I mean, she worked with time for 7 years. Was there bad blood? If not...come on Melissa!
694679278496014336 2016-02-02 00:30:21 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @_kaleidoskope maybe it's both. They didn't ask her knowing they'd be shot down, but now throwing the ask out there bc of MM tweet
694678206868107264 2016-02-02 00:26:05 UTC <KrisLovesMina> @happydayz3 omg whole family  cauliflower! With M we just put cheese on top grated or melted and she'll eat it. Grated on m&c sounds good!
