970382313912786945 2018-03-04 19:35:47 UTC <Ohdearodells> @peterkyle And that great trade deal with the US is not looking positive either.
970381457460953089 2018-03-04 19:32:22 UTC <Ohdearodells> @catherinemep @RobDeManc No, wrong. Many votes for Labour were protest votes against Theresa May or tactical voting to keep the Tories out, and not an endorsement of Labour. Polling has shown that it was the Remainers that swung it for Labour and they ignore this fact at their peril.

In denial about the economic cost, peddling lies about the EU rebate. Let's listen to the future of our country, the young people. @OFOCBrexit #Brexit

965700989574680579 2018-02-19 21:33:52 UTC <Ohdearodells> Those timid Remain MP's representing Leave constituencies should take a leaf out of Hoey's book. She doesn't give a fig how her constituency voted - 77% Remain.  Also careless about NI peace it seems.

965668406094594048 2018-02-19 19:24:23 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Renew_Britain @TheNewEuropean I think its worth challenging MPs who are effectively working against the interests of their constituents.

963112328278495232 2018-02-12 18:07:27 UTC <Ohdearodells> @BrexitBin Dont argue with the fundamentalists, its wasted energy better for talking to people who can see sense.
963111869891399680 2018-02-12 18:05:38 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Femi_Sorry Because it saves the effort of stirring, energy which can be utilised elsewhere, it also means no spoon needed so saves the hot water and detergent for washing.

963096970045861889 2018-02-12 17:06:25 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Digbylj As many have said over this last year when the shit hits the fan Brextremists will try to blame anyone but themselves. So predictable.
963095731128229888 2018-02-12 17:01:30 UTC <Ohdearodells> @ChukaUmunna @woofit79 But when we live in a country where judges can labelled saboteurs and MPs can  be called traitors & the PMs response to Toby Youngs disgusting tweets was naughty boy dont do it again, then these people feel emboldened to attack anyone who opposes them.

958730406693670913 2018-01-31 15:55:15 UTC <Ohdearodells> @corsarof @faisalislam Just how much longer do we have to endure this deceitful, lying, incompetent, poor excuse for a government? In my lifetime (and I'm quite old) can't recall any government so awful.

958246704704352256 2018-01-29 07:53:12 UTC <Ohdearodells> @peterkyle Yes 16 year olds should have the vote. They are the ones that have to live with the mess currently being cooked up by the (predominantly) older generation.

957974096943419392 2018-01-29 13:49:57 UTC <Ohdearodells> @VeroVero777 This is a disgrace. There is no way my taxes should be supporting this group.

We need to stop Brexit but also need find a way to heal our horribly fractured country. I think labelling whole groups puts obstacles in the way.

955559559858356225 2018-01-22 21:55:27 UTC <Ohdearodells> In fact there is no point in UKIP since Mrs May performed that screeching hard right turn after the referendum. #ToriesarethenewUKIP

Labour on the fence re Brexit = Im on the fence with my vote. Think we have to agree to disagree even though we want the same thing ultimately.
952132895711399936 2018-01-13 10:59:06 UTC <Ohdearodells> @acgrayling @Hearthstoker Understand what youre saying but think the situation is complex. E.G. a Lab Cllr in my area tweeting that Labour has got the UKIP vote sewn up. And who cares if they lose a few liberal Remainer snow flakes. I cant be a part of that.
952130340272902145 2018-01-13 10:48:57 UTC <Ohdearodells> @acgrayling @Hearthstoker If Labour gain seats with its current stance that will also be construed as a vote for Brexit though.

Ive decided cant vote my excellent Labour MP again unless  Labours constructive ambiguity stops. Despite his personal stance, a vote for him will be construed as support for Brexit.  We need to send Labour a message at local elections.
952128630947229696 2018-01-13 10:42:09 UTC <Ohdearodells> This thread makes sense imo.https://twitter.com/lancewalton/status/950789466180014081
952128517159911424 2018-01-13 10:41:42 UTC <Ohdearodells> @lancewalton Thanks for this clear thread. Sums up my feelings exactly. We need to send a strong message in the local elections regardless of personal beliefs. Social justice and equality is not deliverable in Brexit UK.

The 1st was in 1975, and the result was 67% in favour of EU membership. Then followed 40+ years of certain people moaning about the result. See! what goes around comes around.
951478884087803906 2018-01-11 15:40:18 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Nigel_Farage Something needs to be done to heal the divisions but what would happen if the vote were 52/48 the other way? The nation would stay bitterly divided as it is now. What a horrible mess. A super-majority should be required to make the result of any ref legitimate.

948977125398401024 2018-01-04 17:59:12 UTC <Ohdearodells> @JCHannah77 @Sansberet Obfuscation, muddy the water, shoot the messenger, change the subject, throw in a load of whataboutery anything to divert from the content and the real message. Nice try but its not worked.
948920755017961472 2018-01-04 14:15:12 UTC <Ohdearodells> @campbellclaret Lot of whataboutery going on here.

948649444219777025 2018-01-03 20:17:07 UTC <Ohdearodells> @toadmeister @stellacreasy I hope someone will be raising this in Parliament. What Boris Johnson calls caustic wit is in fact sexist and misogynistic. Acceptance is to normalise.

948602808927969280 2018-01-03 17:11:48 UTC <Ohdearodells> Worth pointing out this issue transcends party politics. Toby Young's comments unacceptable Tory or not.https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/948597169824690176
948602230525046784 2018-01-03 17:09:30 UTC <Ohdearodells> @SkyNews @HollHox Yes, and although he fought his corner I think he was focused on scoring political points.   This issue transcends party politics imo, it's about common decency and social attitudes, and also justifying use of tax-payers money.

948558852928221184 2018-01-03 14:17:08 UTC <Ohdearodells> @BorisJohnson You dont seem to understand the difference between caustic wit and repulsive sexist comments. But Ill give you the benefit of the doubt, perhaps you havent read the recently deleted tweets that are circulating. Suggest you do.
948554928674439169 2018-01-03 14:01:32 UTC <Ohdearodells> @theresa_may are you listening? Have you read any of Toby Youngs repulsive tweets? Or is it ok to be a sexist if youre a Tory?https://twitter.com/tpopularfront/status/948528413899460608
948552036618031105 2018-01-03 13:50:03 UTC <Ohdearodells> @DavidLammy Not to mention numerous lewd remarks about breasts. Clearly alacks emotional intelligence. Perhaps he could have a chat with my son (15) who understands why its wrong to objectify women?
948550461908570112 2018-01-03 13:43:47 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Rachael_Swindon Actually, I take that back. My teenage boy would not behave so badly. My apologies to teenagers. This appointment beggars belief.

944860876691124224 2017-12-24 09:22:42 UTC <Ohdearodells> @37paday Thanks for your entertaining threads. A bit of light relief in a bleak landscape. Happy Xmas to you and I look forward to the 2018 tweets from Brexitlandia.
944551982408323073 2017-12-23 12:55:16 UTC <Ohdearodells> @AndyHearn09 It takes courage to admit this. 
944544808500121600 2017-12-23 12:26:45 UTC <Ohdearodells> @mrjamesob Oh dear! Surely his account has been hacked? No one could be that ridiculous, could they?
944544171888607232 2017-12-23 12:24:14 UTC <Ohdearodells> @AndyShepp_rd Summed it up nicely Andrew.
944543841784385536 2017-12-23 12:22:55 UTC <Ohdearodells> @DavidLammy   couldnt agree more.  Merry Xmas to a brilliant MP. Looking forward to more of the same in 2018.
944497559749496832 2017-12-23 09:19:00 UTC <Ohdearodells> @JolyonMaugham Its not often I read pleasing News in The Telegraph.
944496028933414912 2017-12-23 09:12:55 UTC <Ohdearodells> @jamescaan Well said!
944495765241716736 2017-12-23 09:11:52 UTC <Ohdearodells> @DavidLammy Sums up the progress of Brexit negotiations.
944495531157487616 2017-12-23 09:10:57 UTC <Ohdearodells> @campbellclaret More meaningless twaddle. But what do you expect from someone who coined the nonsensical phrase Brexit means Brexit?
944304948694667264 2017-12-22 20:33:38 UTC <Ohdearodells> @GuitarMoog 
944292114946551808 2017-12-22 19:42:38 UTC <Ohdearodells> This is frustratingly idiotic. How about our government doing something that REALLY matters? For example proper impact assessments.https://twitter.com/davidallengreen/status/944175195031523329
944289106028265474 2017-12-22 19:30:41 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Anna_Soubry Same to you!

944210516544753664 2017-12-22 14:18:24 UTC <Ohdearodells> @thomasbrake Intimidation tactics.
944210231437025280 2017-12-22 14:17:16 UTC <Ohdearodells> @nickreeves9876 I really do despair.
944210103925866496 2017-12-22 14:16:46 UTC <Ohdearodells> This is incredible! Takes lying to a whole new level. Sadly there are some in this country with the same careless attitude towards the truth.https://twitter.com/mikegalsworthy/status/944204277655928832
944209390143442944 2017-12-22 14:13:55 UTC <Ohdearodells> @CloughOlive The Northern Irish have got an escape route then ... luck of the Irish?
944208715825254401 2017-12-22 14:11:15 UTC <Ohdearodells> @faisalislam This is like a parent giving a toddler a toy to shut it up. How about the govt spending time on something that actually matters..  like ...  I dont know .... impact assessments maybe?
944207418908692480 2017-12-22 14:06:05 UTC <Ohdearodells> @NicolaSturgeon Not just Scotland... spare a thought for those of us stuck in a country trying to turn the clock back!
944206934340751360 2017-12-22 14:04:10 UTC <Ohdearodells> listening to drivel about the wonder of a blue passport. @BBCNews And pleasantly surprised the bulletin ended with a 10,000 strong Japanese choir singing ode to joy.  Am I reading too much into this ? #brexitshambles

943856707180093440 2017-12-21 14:52:29 UTC <Ohdearodells> @JackWDart @BrexitBin How can we find out how our MP voted?
943637330098884608 2017-12-20 00:20:46 UTC <Ohdearodells> @37paday You forgot to say that questioning the lack of clarity is treason that you should be jailed for.
943613507362312197 2017-12-20 22:46:06 UTC <Ohdearodells> @JohnOBrennan2 So! Story is.. PM furious at Commons raid and police leaks NOT that Green lied. #nomoralcompass

943597651911725056 2017-12-20 21:43:06 UTC <Ohdearodells> @PaulbernalUK The other theory is that hes deliberately trying to get sacked? The lying didnt work so maybe he needs to download some porn to his work computer?
943596931116421121 2017-12-20 21:40:14 UTC <Ohdearodells> Read this thread and weep.https://twitter.com/37paday/status/942670060165922816
943595708262834178 2017-12-20 21:35:22 UTC <Ohdearodells> @PaulbernalUK Seriously, a man that can tell so many lies about impact statements will not carry out the resigning in protest threat.
943594972137381888 2017-12-20 21:32:27 UTC <Ohdearodells> @CarolineLucas Empty words... clearly not a man of principle.
943592427578945536 2017-12-20 21:22:20 UTC <Ohdearodells> She is a complete disgrace. completely lost the plot- needs to get a grip. What do the Brexiters say? Deselect!!!https://twitter.com/jonlis1/status/943559049886433280
943591207334301696 2017-12-20 21:17:29 UTC <Ohdearodells> @JohnOBrennan2 I suspect the Irish are a bit too sceptical to fall for his brand of crap.

943202372544802821 2017-12-19 19:32:24 UTC <Ohdearodells> @DavidLammy I hope you have reported this? Daves not very bright is he? but could be dangerous.
942559100935835648 2017-12-17 00:56:16 UTC <Ohdearodells> @sturdyAlex Im perplexed that the people who won are so very very angry 
942558419357196289 2017-12-17 00:53:33 UTC <Ohdearodells> @MailOnline @Anna_Soubry MPs accused of treason should be jailed  for what? exercising a vote? Unbelievable! If those accusers really represent the majority view in this country... I despair

940518107046486017 2017-12-12 09:46:05 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Otto_English @PCSoblahdeehell I was quite good at persuading people to buy things they didnt want to buy yeh ... like Brexit.
940517206353416192 2017-12-12 09:42:30 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Otto_English Is he a sugar daddy? 
940203675976335360 2017-12-11 12:56:39 UTC <Ohdearodells> @UKLabour @CarolineLucas Interesting that Gove said people could change their mind on the deal at the next election... but  the referendum on the final deal that remainers are calling for is not allowed  go figure
940202652192911361 2017-12-11 12:52:35 UTC <Ohdearodells> @UKLabour @CarolineLucas I voted Labour to stop Theresa Mays hard Brexit, then politicians  claim a mandate for Brexit on the basis of Lab and Con votes (80%) WRONG! On current stance If Labour get in  they wont be able to initiate policies whilst economy is tanking. So, no change = no vote from me.
940199293570478080 2017-12-11 12:39:14 UTC <Ohdearodells> @stellacreasy Did I just hear him say that all political parties except Conservatives and DUP support remaining in SM and CU? If thats true 
939998095374503936 2017-12-10 23:19:44 UTC <Ohdearodells> @37paday Well done - very entertaining.

939417630288596993 2017-12-09 08:53:11 UTC <Ohdearodells> Well done and I hope they will be published for all to see ... that's what 'democracy' and 'taking back control' means!https://twitter.com/Labour4EU/status/939206214625488896
939245002546384897 2017-12-08 21:27:13 UTC <Ohdearodells> @fotoole @JulietMEvans @Masters_JamesD Marvellous! Thank you Ireland.
939127869514616833 2017-12-08 13:41:46 UTC <Ohdearodells> If I was Scottish, and voted Remain (as most did) Im wondering how I would feel about the fact that I cant apply for an EU passport but those born in N Ireland can.

938902655182802944 2017-12-07 22:46:51 UTC <Ohdearodells> @faisalislam @Indy_Quint @devastatingstan Slightly confused by this comment - seems like 'some other guys' also got elected in N.I. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election,_2017 so, as far as I can see DUP do not have the mandate to speak for all of N. I.
938896778535079936 2017-12-07 22:23:30 UTC <Ohdearodells> @faisalislam @Indy_Quint @devastatingstan Really? No other parties in NI were elected in NI except DUP?
938894242272903169 2017-12-07 22:13:25 UTC <Ohdearodells> @faisalislam @Indy_Quint @devastatingstan I think the question is, on what basis can the DUP claim to be the legitimate voice of the people of Northern Ireland? given that a) they are not actually in government and b) if they were they were in power, their position would be tempered by the view other parties.
938872342264143873 2017-12-07 20:46:24 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Expat_Anglaise @SebDance Firefighting. Always one step behind events. No coherent strategy. Its painful. Please let it end.

938866422666747905 2017-12-07 20:22:53 UTC <Ohdearodells> @George_Osborne @Doozy_45 @BrimhamG True!
938865872948617216 2017-12-07 20:20:42 UTC <Ohdearodells> @StopBrexitMarch @HansErikIken Thank you. I was born here as was my son. There are very many good people In England, who are devastated about whats happening. I have dual nationality. I dont want to leave... but sadly it must, for the moment remain an option. NL I think would be a good place to go.
938860395665805312 2017-12-07 19:58:56 UTC <Ohdearodells> @StopBrexitMarch @HansErikIken Please have a bit more sympathy with at least 16 million of us who are suffering ... or at the very least suggest something constructive we can do!!! Believe me, it is very, very depressing to live in the UK now. PS how easy is it to relocate to NL?

938841219324661762 2017-12-07 18:42:44 UTC <Ohdearodells> @faisalislam Quite right! The DUP Do not represent all of Northern Ireland... they are supposed to be  in a power sharing executive. The operative word being sharing not dictating

938678136211951616 2017-12-06 07:54:42 UTC <Ohdearodells> @albawhitewolf Sounds as shambolic as the govts Brexit negotiations. Hope youre ok.
938677565048475649 2017-12-06 07:52:25 UTC <Ohdearodells> @BBCr4today @bbcnickrobinson 
938509393154494465 2017-12-06 20:44:10 UTC <Ohdearodells> David Davis has lied to Parliament. He needs to resign and he needs to do it now. Agree? Add your name:https://www.libdems.org.uk/resign?recruiter_id=1254661
938507806520602630 2017-12-06 20:37:52 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Hishyeness @SWWFreeman Address the inequality that gave rise to Brexit. Tough on Brexit tough on the causes of Brexit.

938506292104134658 2017-12-06 20:31:51 UTC <Ohdearodells> @paddyashdown Its humiliating. We are a laughing stock. What can WE do ?
938506088395231234 2017-12-06 20:31:02 UTC <Ohdearodells> @paddyashdown 
938505527390240769 2017-12-06 20:28:48 UTC <Ohdearodells> @ChukaUmunna Why would he do this? He must know his contradictions are being  documented. The gossip for a long time has been about imminent resignation. In my opinion this is a deliberate attempt to get sacked.
938502711816966145 2017-12-06 20:17:37 UTC <Ohdearodells> @realDonaldTrump @number10gov @Peston I wish she could also stand up strongly to the extremists in her cabinet and party.
938502208043323392 2017-12-06 20:15:37 UTC <Ohdearodells> @UKIPNFKN I hope youre right.
938501735630458881 2017-12-06 20:13:44 UTC <Ohdearodells> @DavidDavisMP @ChukaUmunna @SebDance @Peston I reckon Davis is deliberately trying to get sacked ... so he wont be blamed when the you know what hits the you know what.
938501248155779075 2017-12-06 20:11:48 UTC <Ohdearodells> @UKIPNFKN Its a possibility that Davis is actually, deliberately, trying to get sacked (a bit like Boris) what dya think? What other explanation could there be?
938499846339690496 2017-12-06 20:06:14 UTC <Ohdearodells> @FraserNelson @Staedtler @sturdyAlex Yeh I mean who actually wants to know what the impact of a negotiation might be before discussing the details? 
938495644519542789 2017-12-06 19:49:32 UTC <Ohdearodells> @bbclaurak Well what a surprise. But as Nigel Dodds says we will not allow govt to sign this deal  NB - note use of the word allow rather than support   #taildogwag #takingbackcontrol 
938491300386615296 2017-12-06 19:32:16 UTC <Ohdearodells> @HackedOffHugh @lizctinva Brexit and Trump... 2 sides of the same coin.
938490816812732417 2017-12-06 19:30:21 UTC <Ohdearodells> @HackedOffHugh Genuine question. How, can you negotiate a Brexit thats good for Britain  when, you dont know what the impact might be? Leavers? Brexiters? Anyone?
938489640230760448 2017-12-06 19:25:41 UTC <Ohdearodells> This is humiliating- we are, officially, a laughing stock. Get used to it.  Suck it up.https://twitter.com/ajmpolite/status/938370636778557441
938488789080723459 2017-12-06 19:22:18 UTC <Ohdearodells> @patrickwintour @ajmpolite @mattyran How can you negotiate when youve no idea what the impact of your negotiations could be?
938488428471209991 2017-12-06 19:20:52 UTC <Ohdearodells> @dokgolf @JohnOBrennan2  if they can sort out the Horlicks that UK govts Brexit strategy them Kim Jong Un will be an absolute doddle.
938466945007063046 2017-12-06 17:55:30 UTC <Ohdearodells> @dontbrexitfixit I feel your pain. Have broken 2 teeth from grinding. Continually angry

938462943536209921 2017-12-06 17:39:36 UTC <Ohdearodells> It would take a sensible and pragmatic leader to do this. Where would you find one of those?https://twitter.com/richardjgooch/status/938383512452902912
938461763779158016 2017-12-06 17:34:54 UTC <Ohdearodells> @jonlis1 @patrickwintour Oh my god.
938461592164986880 2017-12-06 17:34:14 UTC <Ohdearodells> @JohnOBrennan2 You could not conceivably do any worse.
938461234504110080 2017-12-06 17:32:48 UTC <Ohdearodells> Just a thought ... maybe Davis has finally realised the impossibility of delivering a successful Brexit and is actively trying to get sacked?pic.twitter.com/0B5jIXgZhu
938459026723168256 2017-12-06 17:24:02 UTC <Ohdearodells> A funny thread.  I particularly like 23 and 23. I wonder who Cretinus Maximus could be!https://twitter.com/37paday/status/938321346681032705
938388214225682432 2017-12-06 12:42:39 UTC <Ohdearodells> Watching @bbcdailypolitics both main parties a complete shambles over Brexit. The only logical thing to do #stopbrexit
938366944151064576 2017-12-06 11:18:08 UTC <Ohdearodells> @mrjamesob A genuine question. How can Davies negotiate a paradigm change when the impact of various options havent been analysed? How?
938366164354437120 2017-12-06 11:15:02 UTC <Ohdearodells> @thomasbrake How can Davies negotiate the paradigm change  when he doesnt know the impact of each of the proposed changes? How? A genuine question.
938359157568212992 2017-12-06 10:47:11 UTC <Ohdearodells> @DavidDavisMP @SeemaMalhotra1 Sack the government!!!
938131243006341121 2017-12-05 19:41:32 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Channel4News @campbellclaret @BarrieJenks @GraemeMLyon Mmmm he said that they would eradicate bovine TB. Just ended slaughtering a load of innocent animals. Hes good at predictions isnt he?
938129049540587521 2017-12-05 19:32:49 UTC <Ohdearodells> @TelegraphNews @christopherhope Nigel Dodds also said in the Commons today that they would not allow the government to sign a deal they didnt agree with.  #takingbackcontrol?
938128027778772993 2017-12-05 19:28:46 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Channel4News @campbellclaret @BarrieJenks Wasnt he the badger killer as well?
938127871406723078 2017-12-05 19:28:08 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Channel4News @campbellclaret @Benny_Lemon They have all lied.
938127600865693696 2017-12-05 19:27:04 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Channel4News @campbellclaret  well done Alistair - Paterson is away with the fairies.
938078743490367488 2017-12-05 16:12:55 UTC <Ohdearodells> And 'taking back control' - that's going well too. #arleneinchargehttps://twitter.com/fotoole/status/938044162707947526
938078214664138752 2017-12-05 16:10:49 UTC <Ohdearodells> @PickardJE Double standards.
938077821993410560 2017-12-05 16:09:16 UTC <Ohdearodells> @RhonddaBryant @bethanrjames It is time for parliament to assert it's authority. What does it take for a vote of 'no confidence'?
938077490634993664 2017-12-05 16:07:57 UTC <Ohdearodells> @DavidDavisMP @LeavingPlanet Oh for gawd's sake @mikegalsworthy 'stop talking the country down'.
938076671655194624 2017-12-05 16:04:41 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Rachel5742 But I think he has a point. I dearly want to #StopBrexit, but If, and it's a big if, there was another referendum, and the result was 52/48 the other way would there be a positive outcome?  We need to find a way to heal the divisions. What a horrible mess.
938073629081948160 2017-12-05 15:52:36 UTC <Ohdearodells> better still - No Brexithttps://twitter.com/Open_Britain/status/938071992158310400
938073121239773184 2017-12-05 15:50:35 UTC <Ohdearodells> @JimMFelton As @Keir_Starmer said in the Commons today. It truly is a case of the tail wagging the dog.
938072660751339521 2017-12-05 15:48:45 UTC <Ohdearodells> @scarlettpeach But Ireland didn't vote in the referendum, did it? Oh! I know... As Ireland are being told they should leave too we should have an EU referendum for the UK AND Ireland combined.  Now, I wonder what the result would be? (Hint ... check the latest Irish polls).
938068868467216389 2017-12-05 15:33:41 UTC <Ohdearodells> @JimMFelton Childish....but funny.
938065447144054786 2017-12-05 15:20:05 UTC <Ohdearodells> @RhonddaBryant The name gives it away.
938021635285815296 2017-12-05 12:26:00 UTC <Ohdearodells> @faisalislam @NeilWilson19 @AJC418 Answer is blooming obvious! The whole of the UK should stay in the EU! UK and Ireland joined together! They must stay together!
937963599892549632 2017-12-05 08:35:23 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Ed_Miliband What are parliament doing? Surely a vote of no confidence is in order?
937962967727042561 2017-12-05 08:32:52 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Ed_Miliband Agreed. But where are the opposition holding them to account?
937958757660753921 2017-12-05 08:16:08 UTC <Ohdearodells> @BrexitBin Again, we have a huge Brexit open goal. Will Corbyn step up and take the penalty?
937957788050952192 2017-12-05 08:12:17 UTC <Ohdearodells> @faisalislam You forgot 4. The whole of UK staying in SM and CU,
937956916885671936 2017-12-05 08:08:50 UTC <Ohdearodells> @CloughOlive The logical conclusion of the UKs intransigence is a United Ireland. The DUP can hang on to Mays skirt like a toddler having a tantrum, but in the end theyll have to grow up.
937837634541506562 2017-12-04 00:14:50 UTC <Ohdearodells> @dontbrexitfixit @boycottbgbizsoc Is that fair on the St Kildians?
937837133737361409 2017-12-04 00:12:51 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Anna_Soubry Its time for MPs to assert the sovereignty of parliament. Come on! Your country needs you 
937826740327583744 2017-12-04 23:31:33 UTC <Ohdearodells> @andymoz78 @BrexitBin I guess hes thinking Ill just sit here and watch the government implode.
937819997950357505 2017-12-04 23:04:46 UTC <Ohdearodells> @PeteNorth303 @GuitarMoog Absolutely agree, May needs to call DUPs bluff. Im not sure theyd bring the govt down knowing the result would be Corbyn in power, and also I presume they would also suffer electoral consequences.
937815326716301312 2017-12-04 22:46:12 UTC <Ohdearodells> @ThatTimWalker  hey! @DailyMailUK hows that taking back control thing going? #Arleneincharge
937768746231451653 2017-12-04 19:41:06 UTC <Ohdearodells> @theresa_may @SadiqKhan @ThatTimWalker Please add the peoples republic of Brighton and Hove to that. We are definitely NOT Brexitty down here.
937766041396051968 2017-12-04 19:30:21 UTC <Ohdearodells> @campbellclaret Take back control? Oh yes, to put it in Arlene Fosters hands. Democracy? Sovereignty? What a Horlicks!
937764896091013120 2017-12-04 19:25:48 UTC <Ohdearodells> If the DUP bring down the govt on this issue the logical outcome will be a Corbyn government.  Is this what the DUP want? I dont think so. May should call their bluff. Will she? Or will she or will she dither? What do you think?
937761019706904578 2017-12-04 19:10:24 UTC <Ohdearodells> @AngiePedley @StrongerStabler Its been poisoned by its own bile.
937745063811145728 2017-12-04 18:07:00 UTC <Ohdearodells> @number10gov @Peston Taking back control = controlled by the DUP. Democracy? Sovereignty? #stopbrexit
937728397018615809 2017-12-04 17:00:46 UTC <Ohdearodells> So let me get this straight... the future of the UK is in the hands of the DUP, a small socially Conservative party? How does taking back control feel now? #stopbrexit

934147459256934401 2017-11-24 19:51:24 UTC <Ohdearodells> @LitChick79 Im feeling the same. Lucky enough to be entitled to a EU passport... watching and waiting but relocation always an option.

933960437514858496 2017-11-23 07:28:15 UTC <Ohdearodells> So the undemocratic EU has 6 months to debate and ratify the deal whilst UK parliament gets take it or leave it option - possibly after weve left. #takebackcontrolhttps://twitter.com/thomasbrake/status/933782705547784192

933421199643815936 2017-11-22 19:45:30 UTC <Ohdearodells> @jeremycorbyn @campbellclaret First time Corbyn has gone on Brexit? Couldnt resist the temptation of quoting Varadkar? In any case hes been missing a huge open goal every week. Very disappointing.
933419938215350272 2017-11-22 19:40:30 UTC <Ohdearodells> Indeed they have. Thank you @RhonddaBryant for all your efforts - even though you get lots of undeserved abuse on here - remember there are lots of decent people who appreciate your efforts,
933344282806767616 2017-11-22 14:39:52 UTC <Ohdearodells> @chrisdeerin Frustrating that at PMQs every week there is a big Brexitty goal and Corbyn consistently refuses to take a shot at it.  At least he went for Brexit this week - about time.
933308133371465734 2017-11-22 12:16:13 UTC <Ohdearodells> @Peston At last! Corbyn takes the govt to task on Brexit. About time.

932876371965235200 2017-11-20 07:40:33 UTC <Ohdearodells> @GuitarMoog This is a big problem for me. Weve got a great Remain Labour MP who broke the whip on article 50,  but if I vote Labour thats construed as support for Brexit.
932875846938955776 2017-11-20 07:38:28 UTC <Ohdearodells> Childish I know but we need to take our fun where we can in these bleak times.https://twitter.com/jimmfelton/status/932871774798217216
932757377329303552 2017-11-20 23:47:43 UTC <Ohdearodells> @mikegalsworthy Ironic that Brexit could eventually result in a united Ireland.

How can this happen if its not recognised that animals feel pain? Admittedly not all Brexiteers are Conservatives but lets see the vote breakdown then make our judgements.
932708515738783745 2017-11-20 20:33:33 UTC <Ohdearodells> This is just so wrong... of course animals feel pain and have feelings .... dumb animals? The ones who voted no https://twitter.com/grahamelucas/status/932706643363663873

932299579667763202 2017-11-19 17:28:35 UTC <Ohdearodells> @MrHarryCole @IainTurner5 @ConorConneally Unfortunately government policy in the UK is being directed by a small number of  English (mostly) extremists. They have little regard for the damage that may be inflicted on Ireland in pursuit of their Brexitty dream. I fear this will not end well.

908787921230147585 2017-09-15 20:21:39 UTC <Ohdearodells> @faisalislam I also read that the average age of Labour MP's who votes for the withdrawal bill was 72.
