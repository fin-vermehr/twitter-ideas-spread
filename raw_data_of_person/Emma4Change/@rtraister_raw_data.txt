970519666719428608 2018-03-04 04:41:34 UTC <rtraister> Okay, I googled. I looked on twitter. I still dont know what it means.
970303798710292480 2018-03-04 14:23:47 UTC <rtraister> Also phrasing of my last tweet bizarrely makes it sound like its a new direction, obviously its not. This has always been the goal, the point. The whole fucking point.
970302899849957376 2018-03-04 14:20:13 UTC <rtraister> This was always where Republicans were going to go: away from BIRTH CONTROL. Not abortion. Its not about life. Its about returning women to socially & economically subjugated positions, stripping them of the repro autonomy that permits full participation in public spheres.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/970286487764955136
970073845322469376 2018-03-03 23:10:02 UTC <rtraister> @chick_in_kiev I reconciled myself to prolonged periods of cyclical self-loathing paralysis, then fear-induced productivity.
970070203299192837 2018-03-03 22:55:34 UTC <rtraister> This great story about Moser, the DCCC & whats happening in TX includes a sentiment that echoes so much of what Ive been hearing elsewhere in the country this year: Ive felt like a little blue dot in a sea of red...Since the 2016 election Ive realized Im not alone.https://twitter.com/jiatolentino/status/970057503303061505

969672059688275968 2018-03-02 20:33:29 UTC <rtraister> @CaitlinPacific @sexposparenting Oof. That's awful.
969671805542813696 2018-03-02 20:32:28 UTC <rtraister> I respect those who differ on this & come closer to agreeing on not putting $$ in pockets of men who are alive & currently profiting. But I quoted this because I think it captures the scope of the realizations in front of us, not because I see it as a guide to practical recourse.
969671308647780352 2018-03-02 20:30:30 UTC <rtraister> To clarify in response to some @s: I agree with this sentiment, but don't think it's saying we should get rid of the art. I am not a get-rid-of-the-art person, precisely because I think the task would be too vast, and deprive of us too much pleasure & & beauty & insight. 1/2https://twitter.com/rtraister/status/969667568612102144
969670291726192646 2018-03-02 20:26:27 UTC <rtraister> @2bigdoghouse actually, for me, the implication is that we don't get rid of the art, because it would be impossible. I don't know how the writer of the piece feels about it. The thought is striking more because of its scope than its practical application.
969667568612102144 2018-03-02 20:15:38 UTC <rtraister> Also, from that piece, which is a bit about Sherman Alexie: "I cant help but wonder that if we removed all the books and art created by men whove also done despicable things in their lives, our shelves and walls would be mighty empty."
969667439708565504 2018-03-02 20:15:07 UTC <rtraister> "According to findings in the 2016 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey by the National Institute of Justice, 84.3 percent of Native women experience violence in their lifetimes; 56.1 percent are victims of sexual violence."https://rewire.news/article/2018/03/02/sherman-alexie-longest-running-metoo-movement-history/
969631651738390530 2018-03-02 17:52:55 UTC <rtraister> @sexposparenting @CaitlinPacific I cannot speak to her experience (I merely retweeted) but I remember distinctly asking my mother what "whore" meant after hearing it from protesters outside Abington Hospital in suburban Pennsylvania sometime in the 1980s. No idea the context in which it would have been uttered.

968946474443792390 2018-02-28 20:30:16 UTC <rtraister> @CraycraftBrett great movie, but it pretty thoroughly vilifies the powerful working woman as a cold heartless bitch, in that 80s backlash kind of way.

968944193661030406 2018-02-28 20:21:12 UTC <rtraister> This is great and all (really!) but everyone should watch 9 to 5 right now--like tonight--because it doesn't need to be updated, it's one hundred percent relevant now.https://twitter.com/WomenaHollywood/status/968941158389837824
968909522310959112 2018-02-28 18:03:26 UTC <rtraister> @Dumphim2017 It was a self-deprecating joke about how I write way too long.

968883714557169666 2018-02-28 16:20:53 UTC <rtraister> Also: "A survey of women at [Harvard] published in 1984 showed that sexual harassment was widespread: 49 percent of nontenured faculty, 41 percent of graduate students, and 34 percent of undergraduates said they had been harassed." 49 percent!
968883545895854090 2018-02-28 16:20:12 UTC <rtraister> Take the time to read all of it. Among other things, it sheds  light on how much work, time, energy women have spent dealing with harassment, rather than the work they want to be doing.

968854170777333761 2018-02-28 14:23:29 UTC <rtraister> At some point we have to acknowledge that there is something fundamentally UNPATRIOTIC about not wanting to learn about your own country, about not being able to fully face it in the mirror.
968852969042120705 2018-02-28 14:18:42 UTC <rtraister> Im not sure this is a story about political polarization as much as it is a story about an angry, white, revanchist right-wing desire to not actually understand this nations history and its people.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/02/28/democrats-and-republicans-are-increasingly-divided-on-the-value-of-teaching-black-history/

966889144252182528 2018-02-22 04:15:10 UTC <rtraister> I know this is the least surprising thing, but I still have the capacity to be shocked that he actually said to a gunshot teenager that hed heard [she] was a big fan of his.

964573288801370112 2018-02-16 18:52:47 UTC <rtraister> I realize there's a hell of a lot more going on here; I'm just struck by how bald this strategy is. Some people (in optimistic moods) talk about the death throes of white patriarchy but my god I guess I'm startled by how OBVIOUS (and chillingly effective) the death rattles are..
964572039125327878 2018-02-16 18:47:49 UTC <rtraister> They knew they had to suppress minority turnout post-Obama. Repubs (& Russians, I guess) picked candidate who'd built pol profile on delegitimizing Obama's presidency. Then moves against HRC become about suppressing turnout & claiming her wins as rigged, on both right & left.
964571615873904640 2018-02-16 18:46:08 UTC <rtraister> Structurally, this whole approach--both suppression and spreading lies about fraud--is all about keeping historically marginalized people marginal, manipulating them to maintain white male power, delegitimizing any power that is not white and male.https://twitter.com/AriBerman/status/964569999737327617

962342286943248384 2018-02-10 15:07:35 UTC <rtraister> Reading about how Porter kept his job, I recall writing this: "we can see in meneven in the bad onestalent. We manage to look past their flaws & sexual violations to what value they bring to the world. It is the direct opposite...of how we view women."https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/rebecca-traister-on-the-post-weinstein-reckoning.html

962064216722046981 2018-02-09 20:42:38 UTC <rtraister> Hey you know what else I was just thinking about and remembering? This:https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000004533191/unfiltered-voices-from-donald-trumps-crowds.html
962058916195549184 2018-02-09 20:21:34 UTC <rtraister> For whatever reason, I can't get out of my head how in 2012, Reince Priebus laughingly compared the alleged Republican "War on Women" to claims that there was a "War on Caterpillars." Remember that?
962037075657703424 2018-02-09 18:54:47 UTC <rtraister> And it's the understanding that it's not just him; its the party that created, supported and now defends him; its the history these power imbalances are built on, and the voters, including the white women, who support the continuation of those inequities as patriotic practice.
962035429594644481 2018-02-09 18:48:14 UTC <rtraister> So if you want to understand where the anger that can feel crude, wild, often terrifying in its intensity & unpredictability, comes from: it's this.
962034450732236800 2018-02-09 18:44:21 UTC <rtraister> This is also true, of course, of how he's spoken about and legislated against other people: immigrants, African-Americans, Muslims, Mexicans, nonwhites of every stripe. He gives unapologetic voice to white patriarchal power--and the country selected him to represent and lead it.
962033885545578497 2018-02-09 18:42:06 UTC <rtraister> To him, women are pigs & dogs; he rates them on aesthetic scales & talks of how much their bodies disgust him. He's just reaffirming what he ALWAYS said & which not only did not disqualify him, but bolstered his standing as he beat a female opponent: women are not human beings.
962033339677884416 2018-02-09 18:39:56 UTC <rtraister> But the crucial part: we knew this about Donald Trump & we elected him anyway, which means that by some measure, women do not exist in our national equation as full human beings. Trump's answer to the old question-are women people?-has always been clear, yet he is our president.
962033084865499136 2018-02-09 18:38:55 UTC <rtraister> The president, speaking of a man accused by multiple women of violent crime, can only speak of that man's talents, future, sadness. Men are the subjects, the people whose fates matter, who feel sadness and who are worthy of eliciting sadness. Women do not exist in this equation.

961657685065240582 2018-02-08 17:47:13 UTC <rtraister> @briebriejoy sorry, tried to respond earlier but my wifi is shaky. I realize it's easier to find value in online disagreement when not a participant, but I saw that as a real exchange: SJ questioned, you responded clearly & at length, it's just that you disagreed...
961645527619260417 2018-02-08 16:58:54 UTC <rtraister> @ambertamblyn I am really taken by the use of "weird"--and I used it in my writing about our "weird overreaction," so I'm wholly indicting myself here too--but there is such an immediate connotation with "weird" to "weird sisters" from Macbeth.
961644977569886210 2018-02-08 16:56:43 UTC <rtraister> @briebriejoy And I should add that some (I believe large) portion of the pushback isn't reflexive abuse, but genuine disagreement, about issues people feel passionately about. True in any activist/social change moment--and hard. Explosive.
961644568776265728 2018-02-08 16:55:06 UTC <rtraister> @briebriejoy So the view of the ravening feminist mob becomes self-fulfilling prophecy when editors absorb it & become nervous. But Tolentino, Tortorici, Heller, Franklin, Gessen, Flanagan...lots of people have been voicing anxieties without sustaining harm, I think.
961643675280437249 2018-02-08 16:51:33 UTC <rtraister> @briebriejoy I think that joke in part reflects the way that the view of metoo as moblike has really taken root. Like the torches will really be lit! But lots of people have pushed back against the excesses without getting drummed out of their jobs or having their publications boycotted.
961642336336928768 2018-02-08 16:46:14 UTC <rtraister> @briebriejoy But there's also the reality that it's a medium built for short exchange, and short exchange can quickly become combative or dismissive, and also gets easily misunderstood.
961642176638746625 2018-02-08 16:45:36 UTC <rtraister> @briebriejoy Which doesn't mean that there haven't been really powerful, nuanced convos here re these same subjects-hashtags & threads & back & forths. & even short tweets that offer the relief of rage (yes! rage!) and communion and also humor. & of course it's space available to more people.
961641731275018241 2018-02-08 16:43:49 UTC <rtraister> @briebriejoy That is a luxury & I'm very aware of what a privilege it is to have that kind of space. Roiphe has a the same luxury & lots of the nuanced writing about metoo has been longform, with space for context, questioning & explanation. That doesn't exist (in the same way) on Twitter.
961641359135399937 2018-02-08 16:42:21 UTC <rtraister> @briebriejoy I think what you're getting at--and part of what Roiphe is responding to--is one of the facets of #onhere: the form/nature/length of expression does encourage certain kinds of responses and inhibit others. The piece where I wrote about the overreaction was 6,000 words!
961633583462051842 2018-02-08 16:11:27 UTC <rtraister> This is a fascinating conversation. I'm really interested in Roiphe's willingness to argue that comparisons of Lorin Stein to Harvey Weinstein are the problem, at the same time that she compares her ill-treatment online to Stalinism and the Dreyfus affair:https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/a-conversation-with-katie-roiphe.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_ru

958553935702384642 2018-01-30 04:14:01 UTC <rtraister> For those @'ing me re reverse discrimination & limiting Kennedy bc of his identity: I'm not suggesting not supporting him. Just that tonight's was a spotlight job, a chance to give an extra boost to a young pol. Why not pick one who doesn't already have his built-in advantages?
958550135318941696 2018-01-30 03:58:55 UTC <rtraister> Again: good speech, talented politician! But imagine "metoo" & "Black Lives Matter" coming out of the mouth of a not-white-man. He's young & I'm pretty sure he has a bright future. But we gotta be able to ALSO see potential--& cultivate it--in people who don't look like the past.
958549352821207040 2018-01-30 03:55:49 UTC <rtraister> This is a good speech, delivered well. But I am totally befuddled by a party that looks around at this country, right now, and decides its best rebuttal to Donald Trump comes from the white male scion of America's oldest dynasty.
958546729086930944 2018-01-30 03:45:23 UTC <rtraister> I'm sorry, I was expecting Maxine Waters. Why is there a Kennedy on my screen?

958128027619217408 2018-01-29 00:01:37 UTC <rtraister> @TheCut @DaniSMcNally But you're 100% right to point out that while perhaps not radical, there's long history of feminism/activism in women's mags. McCalls, LHJ & Mademoiselle all serialized Friedan. Have read Glamour on Hyde, Cosmo on contraception, MC on BLM founders, Teen Vogue has been killing it.
958124641687662592 2018-01-29 23:48:10 UTC <rtraister> @TheCut @DaniSMcNally I did not intend it as a broad dismissal of women's magazines, to which I am a career-long contributor. I write for a mainstream magazine that I would ALSO happily joke is not exactly the radical women's collective. Disruptive politics are finding their way into popular media.
958122797498290182 2018-01-29 23:40:50 UTC <rtraister> @TheCut @DaniSMcNally I stand by that, tho point was not only about women's mags. They were two I cited (going to show that they ARE leading with radical ideas right now) But it was about newly broad appeal--"even Conan"--of ideas that felt very 70s in their radical ambitions.
958120181108301826 2018-01-29 23:30:26 UTC <rtraister> @TheCut @DaniSMcNally Fair point/thread. Longtime Elle contributor, I've written for MC, Vogue, Glamour, Cosmo re politics, feminism, race. Intended point was that politics of replacement are pretty radical. And while mainstream magazines are often smartly political, they're not always radical.

957641885119602688 2018-01-28 15:49:52 UTC <rtraister> @elongreen @amychozick Thats why Im particularly conscious of labeling PP controversial (certainly fair in congressional/antichoice activist context) without acknowledgment of its broad, high popularity & numbers who rely on it in many regions. Precisely because so many dont realize 2nd part.
957640838565294082 2018-01-28 15:45:42 UTC <rtraister> @elongreen @amychozick I come at that angle from the perspective of someone who is, as a reporter on this stuff, regularly re-surprised by PPs high approval ratings, given the narrative of its controversial status, and always staggered by the millions who depend on  it as only health care source.
957611779898650627 2018-01-28 13:50:14 UTC <rtraister> @elongreen Right. Also, treatment of fact that even Trump voters rely on PP as startling claim. Of course they do! More than 50% percent of PP clinics are in areas w/o other nearby health-care options. Also, PP has skyhigh popularity across parties. But omission of shooting got me most.

956548105410875392 2018-01-25 15:23:34 UTC <rtraister> Even if you disagreed profoundly & found many of the arguments dishonest/incomplete, there was sensation that the fork had been stuck; it was done, at least in the form it had existed. That was how I experienced it anyway.

955501580064784384 2018-01-22 18:05:03 UTC <rtraister> @shaizamaiza there's the pity, & sense that this awakening to fury is good and necessary, but must come with acknowledgement that those incentives are just that: incentives for not challenging the power structures, in exchange for which they have gotten power/privileges.

955482849662128129 2018-01-22 16:50:38 UTC <rtraister> @carolynedgar I'd be really, really eager to read that. I'm writing a lot in my book about anger, race, and activism/politics/political history. Whether or not you write something (and I hope you do) maybe we could speak by phone?

955472524523040768 2018-01-22 16:09:36 UTC <rtraister> @carolynedgar I wholly agree with all of that, & am usually allergic to reductive comparisons between racism and sexism. Honestly, I cannot tell you why that part of the piece wasn't what jumped out at me when I read it last week.

952363509534330880 2018-01-13 02:15:29 UTC <rtraister> @petridishes Also this: It is exactly like what has happened in the past with Joseph McCarthy: The Senate is forming a committee & rounding up people suspected of seditious anti-American activities. Well...it isnt quite like that, but there is a list involvedhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2018/01/13/ladies-lets-be-reasonable-about-metoo-or-nothing-will-ever-be-sexy-again/?utm_term=.433f07b3cad7

951831801026269186 2018-01-12 15:02:40 UTC <rtraister> @lyzl @KateHarding @LauraMLippman Its confusing. I hate the whole wave thing. Every time theres an activist surge someone wants to call it a wave when maybe its just an eddy or a splash or maybe its all one big centuries long project that moves in fits and starts and wont end till were all long dead.
951830478138564608 2018-01-12 14:57:24 UTC <rtraister> @lyzl @KateHarding @LauraMLippman First wave is suffrage, second wave is 1970s era, she is part of backlash to second wave; everything after is more confusing.
951823212563791872 2018-01-12 14:28:32 UTC <rtraister> @LynnSherr In her view
951820381425414144 2018-01-12 14:17:17 UTC <rtraister> @mylupe2010 Well, it could be for any number of reasons (can be short way to call someone old, for example) but in Roiphes case, its because she came to fame by denouncing the second wave.
951818441438257160 2018-01-12 14:09:35 UTC <rtraister> @mylupe2010 Its how 1960/70s-era feminism is often referred to, as opposed to 1st wave, which was suffrage movement. Then it gets confusing: maybe there was a 3rd wave in 90s, or maybe now is the 3rd wave, or 4th. Or maybe (I think) we should ditch waves.
951817139312365569 2018-01-12 14:04:24 UTC <rtraister> The irony is that referring to Roiphe as second wave is perhaps the single most wounding thing you could do to her. Her career was built on disavowal of and distance from the politics & ideology of the second wave, her mothers generation. She wanted none of its stain on her.

950863924194369542 2018-01-09 22:56:40 UTC <rtraister> That dynamic feels particularly sharp today, watching the swirl around Roiphe, whose work I've mostly abhorred (and occasionally admired) since I was 18. Here's a profile I wrote of her, and her particular siren song, a decade ago:https://www.salon.com/2007/07/09/katie_roiphe/

949652227618156544 2018-01-06 14:41:49 UTC <rtraister> @sbagen Maybe some of the allegations against them are vague or baseless, or maybe they are harassers with lengthy records of complaint. Point is that just because we don't KNOW what the details are doesn't mean those details don't exist.
949651706224275457 2018-01-06 14:39:45 UTC <rtraister> @sbagen This is, crucially, part of why some of these cases remain "murky;" when men are preemptively fired (sometimes by orgs trying to cover their own asses) in advance of reporting, we don't fully learn what they're accused of, which can frame them as victims of an inquisition.

941141662620962817 2017-12-13 03:03:52 UTC <rtraister> He was the chairman of the senate judiciary committee. He was ABLE to do more than he did. Also, on "owing" her an apology...it's been 26 years, dude.
941141133257838593 2017-12-13 03:01:46 UTC <rtraister> "I wish I had been able to do more" is fascinating phrasing here.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/941111806461964288
941090278278037508 2017-12-13 23:39:41 UTC <rtraister> And both of these pieces amplify the point that so many of us have been trying to argue: that this is about work, about long-term, deeply embedded, systemic and cyclical disadvantages women face in workplaces.
941080832961384449 2017-12-13 23:02:09 UTC <rtraister> In the same vein, I'm late to this devastating piece by Salma Hayek:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/13/opinion/contributors/salma-hayek-harvey-weinstein.html?_r=0

940950224989835264 2017-12-13 14:23:10 UTC <rtraister> This story about the Ken Friedman/Batali empire was chilling & so well reported by @kimseverson & @juliamoskin.

940788378588598272 2017-12-12 03:40:03 UTC <rtraister> That means that the Dem Senate womens calls for Franken to resign last week will likely look, in retrospect, strategically smart & like a symbolic, watershed moment, emblematic of the upheaval of power structures that is underway.
940786447497515011 2017-12-12 03:32:22 UTC <rtraister> Important note, given last weeks (valid) anxieties: it sure seems like #metoo/the reckoning is not going to just be about Dems eating their own.

935609803371696128 2017-11-28 20:42:14 UTC <rtraister> "While its true that confronting colleagues w potentially career-altering accusations is bitter duty, its the conversations w aggrieved accusers I keep thinking of. How are we to regard the women whose charges we would bury or belittle?" This is great:http://niemanreports.org/articles/when-women-stand-up-against-harassers-in-the-newsroom/
935517802366152704 2017-11-28 14:36:39 UTC <rtraister> Also, let's be clear: "believe all women" is NOT A THING. Weiss has pumped it up from the original "believe women" to make the "huntresses" sound even more threatening. This is exactly the process many of us have been talking about: transformation of women into the aggressors.
935516853002276865 2017-11-28 14:32:53 UTC <rtraister> That worry, that these stories could be falsified and weaponized, is close to the heart of so many people I've talked to in this period; "believe all women" is a million miles from being an "organizing political principle" here.
935515846608265217 2017-11-28 14:28:53 UTC <rtraister> The story about Franken groping Huffington did not get serious traction, nor did Melanie Morgan's claims. What's more: Every women I know is concerned about exactly the specters Weiss raises: a false accusation that would derail the conversation, a gross overreaction.
935515475190206464 2017-11-28 14:27:24 UTC <rtraister> The Post catching the liar yesterday isn't some lucky quirk of fate; it's symptomatic of how this process has been playing out: these claims have not simply been swallowed whole, rather, there have been terrific journalists making sure stories are airtight.
935514999509876737 2017-11-28 14:25:31 UTC <rtraister> And "me too" is not about some social injunction that we believe all women. It's about women telling their own stories. In the most prominent current cases, those stories have then been reported, investigated, fact checked & backed up by the outlets reporting on them.
935514397325316096 2017-11-28 14:23:07 UTC <rtraister> What I find perplexing about this piece is that it is wholly dishonest about the sentiment fueling this moment. The, uh, cough, "huntresses' war cry" is NOT "believe all women." It's "me too."https://nyti.ms/2k4t6lE

923545410953732096 2017-10-26 13:42:39 UTC <rtraister> And, as Jodi points out here, here are some other men who have had story-telling authority re gender and power:https://twitter.com/jodikantor/status/923543379127996417

923539222954463238 2017-10-26 13:18:03 UTC <rtraister> When critics resist the argument that gender & power determined so much about HRCs path, recall that that argument isnt just about HER.
923538942045147138 2017-10-26 13:16:56 UTC <rtraister> This guy, whose young female colleagues accuse of rubbing his dick against them, shaped (& profited handsomely from) the story of HRC.

923537843082973189 2017-10-26 13:12:34 UTC <rtraister> Broader thing re Halperin, alongside specifics that will rightly be dug up re what he said about Trump or Clinton & harassment, is that he..

923179207622119424 2017-10-25 13:27:29 UTC <rtraister> I dont want to give men extra credit for acknowledging ubiquity of harassment, but its fascinating to watch them actually think about it..
922966168746459136 2017-10-24 23:20:57 UTC <rtraister> Am retweeting additions. Though Id say the handful of them does not negate the original point.
922965902273990657 2017-10-24 23:19:53 UTC <rtraister> Update: there are more! Especially if you expand my originally imagined, arbitrary category (Id been thinking print, & not newsweeklies)https://twitter.com/rtraister/status/922961123569172480
922964411723210752 2017-10-24 23:13:58 UTC <rtraister> @grossdm Brown was the one Id been counting. I hadnt included news weeklies but am retweeting acknowledgments of Gibbs and Whitaker.

922962307788963841 2017-10-24 23:05:36 UTC <rtraister> Just something to consider when thinking about, say, how fucked up it is that weve only ever had one non-white-guy President in 240 years.
922961814455013377 2017-10-24 23:03:39 UTC <rtraister> @lizzieohreally Yes
922961765255860226 2017-10-24 23:03:27 UTC <rtraister> And the exception was of course a woman who wound up working for...Harvey.

914197496259280897 2017-09-30 18:37:22 UTC <rtraister> @samhabermas Yeah I just tweeted to clarify what I meant which was not at all the same as what Borhlert meant. Also I've been persuaded re comparisons.
914189279244558338 2017-09-30 18:04:43 UTC <rtraister> @EricBoehlert @errol54 Hi you misread my tweet.
914188732038832128 2017-09-30 18:02:33 UTC <rtraister> I've also been swiftly persuaded that in fact we must ALSO acknowledge them together, as part of long story of environmental/federal racism.
914188215376076800 2017-09-30 18:00:29 UTC <rtraister> What I meant was: I think it's important to evaluate these cruel & racist failures on their own terms, without shorthand elision. But...

914186179247050753 2017-09-30 17:52:24 UTC <rtraister> I guess I want to evaluate Trump's cruelty/racism here on its own terms, perhaps IN ADDITION to acknowledging it as part of larger pattern
914185363937202176 2017-09-30 17:49:10 UTC <rtraister> I think my original 180 were clear!
914184969223852037 2017-09-30 17:47:36 UTC <rtraister> But I see the point if people are speaking specifically about environmental racism, to be clear that similar impulses are at work.
914184835006189569 2017-09-30 17:47:04 UTC <rtraister> Maybe it can. My response this morning was impulse to not lett EITHER Bush or Trump off the hook for their individual failures via elision.
914183540702695425 2017-09-30 17:41:55 UTC <rtraister> I was not suggesting the comparison was malevolent. That the failures themselves were.
914183371198222338 2017-09-30 17:41:15 UTC <rtraister> I just retweeted someone making that argument compellingly. Was just letting you know you read my tweet incorrectly.
914182307027804160 2017-09-30 17:37:01 UTC <rtraister> This is a smart point re comparisons of Katrina and Puerto Rico I objected to earlier.https://twitter.com/latxcvi/status/914151666097819648
914181537968648192 2017-09-30 17:33:57 UTC <rtraister> No I said they were two instances of gross malevolence, independent from each other. No rehabilitation of Bush/Katrina. At all.
914122859274018821 2017-09-30 13:40:47 UTC <rtraister> There are always NEW inroads to be made when it comes to cruelty, harm and insult enacted by the powerful unto the vulnerable.
914122170707701760 2017-09-30 13:38:03 UTC <rtraister> Not everything must be measured on scale of what came before: i.e. "Trump's Katrina." This can be, & is, freshly & independently malevolent.

912423526342303744 2017-09-25 21:08:15 UTC <rtraister> @HamiltonCain Yes, absolutely. Also rural marry younger than urban. Lots and lots of overlapping factors.
912423367042531329 2017-09-25 21:07:37 UTC <rtraister> @lucia_graves @NatalieDaher7 @LindaHirshman1 w college educated women went for Hillary by high margin, yes. But also recall that those politico numbers are from a pre-election survey.
912412213381648384 2017-09-25 20:23:18 UTC <rtraister> @ahab99 but if you mean the temperament/cultural leanings of those who opt for more conservative fam structure (marriage) that's harder to track

912411253833904131 2017-09-25 20:19:29 UTC <rtraister> @ahab99 Well, people do look at economic circumstances, which are closely tied to question of who marries, and related to all of the below:
912389089223159808 2017-09-25 18:51:24 UTC <rtraister> @lucia_graves @NatalieDaher7 @LindaHirshman1 "wwc women put Trump 23 points ahead of HRC...but when you looked at only unmarried white non-college-educated women, gap was only 11 %"
912388903637839873 2017-09-25 18:50:40 UTC <rtraister> @lucia_graves @NatalieDaher7 @LindaHirshman1 This from Politico pre-election, showing marriage gap amongst working class white women:http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/donald-trump-2016-blue-collar-woman-214356
912388515203371008 2017-09-25 18:49:08 UTC <rtraister> @lucia_graves @NatalieDaher7 @LindaHirshman1 I haven't seen any really great breakdowns of white women's 16 vote, controlling for $ and marital status, post election. But. There was...
912386936781893633 2017-09-25 18:42:51 UTC <rtraister> (& therefore depend on them for their own power--white women, married women) to vote to support & maintain those white male power structures
912386506161102848 2017-09-25 18:41:09 UTC <rtraister> Fuller reality is that there are structural incentives for women who derive benefits from white male power structures...
912386182834683904 2017-09-25 18:39:51 UTC <rtraister> Which is not to say that there aren't plenty of instances in which those personal dynamics ARE just out there and true and in play. But...
912385993436811265 2017-09-25 18:39:06 UTC <rtraister> FWIW I think HRC describing marital/voting dynamics as personal--wives pressured by husbands to vote a certain way--doesn't tell whole story
912384107539238915 2017-09-25 18:31:37 UTC <rtraister> Not unrelated to why conservatives oppose the very policies that would most offer more single women more economic (& other) stability.
912383584056627200 2017-09-25 18:29:32 UTC <rtraister> Not unrelated to why, in 12, Romney answered debate Q re how to stem gun violence by suggesting, "think about getting married to someone!"
912383197958336512 2017-09-25 18:28:00 UTC <rtraister> This is not unrelated to why Bush administration (& then Obama admin, though differently) dumped billions into marriage promotion programs.
912382380975034369 2017-09-25 18:24:45 UTC <rtraister> Fighting to punish, shame, blame and ultimately reduce a growing population very likely to vote against them.
912382133125206016 2017-09-25 18:23:46 UTC <rtraister> So when you hear conservatives describing success sequence, or claiming marriage is cure for poverty, they're not only wrong, they're also..
912381803088007168 2017-09-25 18:22:27 UTC <rtraister> All of which, if expressed electorally (& it isn't always...less vivid in 16 than 12) leads them to vote left. And conservatives fear this.
912381543443820545 2017-09-25 18:21:25 UTC <rtraister> Also higher min wage, paid leave, subsidized childcare, workplace protections, stronger unions, far more robust safety net and more.
912381071110672384 2017-09-25 18:19:33 UTC <rtraister> "They need contraception, health care, and they love to talk about equal pay." FWIW Watters is not wrong about what unmarried women need...
912380777341554688 2017-09-25 18:18:23 UTC <rtraister> Echoed by Jesse Watters in 2014 re "Beyonce Voters:" They depend on government because theyre not depending on their husbands."
912380103631540225 2017-09-25 18:15:42 UTC <rtraister> In 2012, Phyllis Schlafly said that Obama was trying to keep women single/dependent on gov't because "he knows that's his constituency."
912379843718864908 2017-09-25 18:14:40 UTC <rtraister> In 2013, Jonathan Last found that "marriage rate for [women 25-30] was a greater influence on vote choice than any other variable.
912379597307641857 2017-09-25 18:13:41 UTC <rtraister> Thread I'd love to tack on here: conservatives are VERY aware of marriage gap; not unrelated to push for marriage.https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/white-women-husbands-voting?CMP=share_btn_tw
912378377453096960 2017-09-25 18:08:51 UTC <rtraister> @lucia_graves @NatalieDaher7 @LindaHirshman1 Yes, that's an element of the marriage divide in voting. Wealth and race.

892382501968236544 2017-08-01 13:52:22 UTC <rtraister> Such sadness that presumed white male competence and authority is being exposed as the wholly made-up, baseless sham it's always been.
892379826576916481 2017-08-01 13:41:44 UTC <rtraister> I liked this column better when it was performed by James Gandolfini:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvjYuIBy-oQ&sns=tw
892379093647405057 2017-08-01 13:38:50 UTC <rtraister> Oh no I kept reading.
892378897626607617 2017-08-01 13:38:03 UTC <rtraister> @evepeyser Oh my god he does indeed
892378346792906752 2017-08-01 13:35:52 UTC <rtraister> Because I can think of others
892377938787749888 2017-08-01 13:34:14 UTC <rtraister> I mean, are we naming all the kinds of manliness we can?
892377793958469635 2017-08-01 13:33:40 UTC <rtraister> Not today, David Brookspic.twitter.com/F86fBSIL59
892129649253339136 2017-07-31 21:07:38 UTC <rtraister> @Ana_Zumba @EricJafMN I'm not blaming it on leftists.
892108001301102594 2017-07-31 19:41:36 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 It seems that the big difference in our views is that you are far more optimistic than I & I am usually (believe it or not) optimistic.
892106546242605058 2017-07-31 19:35:49 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 Well a) I've never listened to Chuck Todd in my life but b) I really hope you're right that it's the young & non-white who're in charge
892105647235452928 2017-07-31 19:32:15 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 But if the up and comers repeat the language and strategic tics of the old white people who preceded them it doesn't offer comfort.
892105545401982976 2017-07-31 19:31:51 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 Look, I am one hundred percent with you in my view of who makes up the party and who SHOULD be in charge of it.
892105274475020289 2017-07-31 19:30:46 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 It's not just today's news in the Hill. It's been Perez, Sanders, Pelosi, since the election, following SAME PLAYBOOK
892105185375506434 2017-07-31 19:30:25 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 That got us to stalled healthcare reform and willingness to trade on abortion while crafting crucial progressive policy
892105096556892161 2017-07-31 19:30:04 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 Why on earth would I feel reassurance right now that today's Dems don't really mean it in the way that, say, Rahm did in 06?
892104994270392320 2017-07-31 19:29:39 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 a) old white people remain largely at helm of party b) don't know how you read today as a break from sentiments of past old white people
892104446573936640 2017-07-31 19:27:29 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 Sanders distinguished between ID politics & economic issues, citing abortion in particular, throughout 16.
892104238247137280 2017-07-31 19:26:39 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 Rahm's strategy re anti-choice Dems in 06, HRC's comments in Albany in 05, and Kerry's post 04. This is history of party's view of issue.
892104038602461184 2017-07-31 19:25:51 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 "Litmus test" may be media's frame here, but pols have rarely/never challenged it, and can't be blamed for comments on ID politics, for...
892103741507284992 2017-07-31 19:24:41 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 It's also re big pronouncements on inclusion & moving away from ID politics, done by Perez, Pelosi, HRC, Sanders, Rahm, all of them forever.
892103261431443456 2017-07-31 19:22:46 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 plenty of ways to communicate that, AND let the good Jesuit thru, that don't reduce support of repro rights/justice to a "litmus test"
892103062676025344 2017-07-31 19:21:59 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 Keeping options open is different from saying "no litmus test." If your party stands behind key positions on gender/econ equality, there are
892102781015818244 2017-07-31 19:20:52 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 I have heard this song many times over. My objection here is to language "litmus test" & fact that gets applied to THIS issue, over & over
892102087496040451 2017-07-31 19:18:06 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 I grew up in PA. I know from anti-abortion Dems. I get it & have never urged anyone to vote against one & have voted for plenty myself.
892097509010681857 2017-07-31 18:59:55 UTC <rtraister> @SarahLerner @WPalmerCurl @Kelebration In a primary, hell yes I'd oppose. Not just because of abortion. But if he were the Dem nominee, of course I'd vote for him.
892097315372240896 2017-07-31 18:59:09 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 But that that doesn't mean a party should jettison those priorities.
892097195515797504 2017-07-31 18:58:40 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 3rd, I'd acknowledge there are plenty of policy priorities-re wages, healthcare, crim justice reform-that if dropped, would win more votes..
892096939243831296 2017-07-31 18:57:39 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 that there is plenty of more recent polling showing divides on abortion not to be as fixed as most traditional polling shows.
892096830871396352 2017-07-31 18:57:13 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 their polling, given that a man who's been pro-choice his whole life just won the presidency thanks in large part to evangelicals, and...
892096704325046275 2017-07-31 18:56:43 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 Well, first, I would not make a big "big tent" statement about it and dress it up as progressive inclusivity. Second, I'd question...
892095259936739328 2017-07-31 18:50:58 UTC <rtraister> @SarahLerner @WPalmerCurl @Kelebration Well, not by me! (Though of course I voted for him for VP)
892090966622044161 2017-07-31 18:33:55 UTC <rtraister> @ThorntonHall1 In that case what I said today would come as no surprise to them...
892088104206708737 2017-07-31 18:22:32 UTC <rtraister> @KalesMulls I love the DSA & am excited by energy behind moving the left really left. Wary of factional anger, which is coming from from all directions.
892087089461956608 2017-07-31 18:18:30 UTC <rtraister> @EricJafMN So? Who is defending HRC or Pelosi here? They, like most Dems, have been part of stampedes away from abortion, now & in past.
892086779108614148 2017-07-31 18:17:16 UTC <rtraister> @SarahLerner @WPalmerCurl @Kelebration Earlier in his career, Joe Biden voted for Hyde multiple times, without exceptions for life of the mother. He has not always been unyielding
892086105436278786 2017-07-31 18:14:36 UTC <rtraister> @ayeletw c) they assume they can take those women for granted, because historically, they can! Which is why it's crucial to fight them on it.
892086011613908992 2017-07-31 18:14:13 UTC <rtraister> @ayeletw It's just the issue that Ds want to ditch every time they lose bc a) some are skeeved by it b) they resent the women who make it central &
892085779874410496 2017-07-31 18:13:18 UTC <rtraister> @ayeletw Plus, evangelicals voted for Trump! A man who was pro-choice until 2016!
892085467033870336 2017-07-31 18:12:04 UTC <rtraister> @ayeletw And I have seen absolutely zero compelling evidence that that's why they lost. That's just the knee-jerk issue to blame.
892085341200539648 2017-07-31 18:11:34 UTC <rtraister> @ayeletw The frustrating thing is that Dems were moving in the right direction on this issue:https://www.thecut.com/2015/11/can-democrats-win-on-abortion.html
892085040313757696 2017-07-31 18:10:22 UTC <rtraister> @ayeletw But abortion isn't as big a dividing line as everyone believes it to be. Recent polling has support for Roe at 7 in 10, even in KS.
892069304786710533 2017-07-31 17:07:50 UTC <rtraister> Must be the "identity politics meh" crowd that's been flooding switchboards and founding Indivisible chapters, amirite dumbasses?
892068740841566212 2017-07-31 17:05:36 UTC <rtraister> Also who do they think is making calls, organizing, exhibiting activist energies that give Dems any fucking prayer of winning House in 18?
892058215235637249 2017-07-31 16:23:46 UTC <rtraister> How about this "litmus test:" Are you working to abolish Hyde and if not gtfoh with your "progressivism." Think DCCC would go for it?
892056856289476608 2017-07-31 16:18:22 UTC <rtraister> Progressivism is about so much MORE than this mono-focus on half the population's ability to (kinda) determine what they do w their bodies!
892055684476522496 2017-07-31 16:13:43 UTC <rtraister> Irritating purists with their focus on women's ability to exert agency over their bodies + economic, familial, professional & sexual lives!
892054856357355520 2017-07-31 16:10:25 UTC <rtraister> Love how the expectation that Democratic candidates support public health good & believe in women's bodily autonomy is a "litmus test."https://twitter.com/bkamisar/status/892024701970731012
892013906620817408 2017-07-31 13:27:42 UTC <rtraister> The thing about "reclaiming my time" is that it has such tremendous historical resonance, as a broader idea.https://twitter.com/broderickgreer/status/891805592976863233
891369075598909440 2017-07-29 18:45:23 UTC <rtraister> @JillFilipovic You'll be startled to hear that I am.
891348507868712961 2017-07-29 17:23:39 UTC <rtraister> @inclusionist I loved how they also didn't know anyone was listening to what they were saying in those songs.
891339305997791232 2017-07-29 16:47:05 UTC <rtraister> Everyone should get past the headline and read the full story because it's far more hilarious and awful than the headline indicates.https://twitter.com/fdrlst/status/891282168424443906
891039317220610053 2017-07-28 20:55:02 UTC <rtraister> I'll report back next week on how she's doing in Aroostook, her home county. Might be...different (though maybe not!) https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/891019086146174976

890942430027153410 2017-07-28 14:30:02 UTC <rtraister> Also, slightly unrelated, I think Bernie cast the right vote yesterday. It was about Iran, not about Russia, and he was correct.
890942057354850304 2017-07-28 14:28:34 UTC <rtraister> Also Ds & Is keeping it together (incl Mazie Hirono, stage4 cancer patient, 2nd woc ever elected to Senate, who didn't get hero's ovation)
890941125216935936 2017-07-28 14:24:51 UTC <rtraister> Collins' & Murkowski's willingness to stand firm on their nos--while getting threatened with duels and beatings and revenge--was crucial.
890940671053508608 2017-07-28 14:23:03 UTC <rtraister> Months of protests, calls, postcards, emails, chanting, marching, town-halling, Facebook posting, organizing made all the difference.
890934345699119104 2017-07-28 13:57:55 UTC <rtraister> Who's going to break it to him? (The part about how many votes this great legislation needed to pass.)https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890931465885798400

890804121778782208 2017-07-27 05:20:27 UTC <rtraister> Can someone hug Murkowski though because I hear she's being rounded on by animals?https://twitter.com/bcappelbaum/status/890802208698023940

890795901723189253 2017-07-27 04:47:47 UTC <rtraister> @chrislhayes I'm gonna be so mad that you made me briefly hopeful if you're wrong.
890794981903835136 2017-07-27 04:44:08 UTC <rtraister> Those of us trying to keep up on Twitter (in a dark room, sleeping family beside us) are appreciating the hopeful body language reads fwiw.
890747474578731010 2017-07-27 01:35:21 UTC <rtraister> @andreagrimes Weirdly, they understand it more easily because it's like a cartoon of evil and outsized incompetence.

890344150498979844 2017-07-26 22:52:41 UTC <rtraister> @ecshowalter Typical of a much larger mindset than just Trump cohort, I think.

890331234181812224 2017-07-26 22:01:22 UTC <rtraister> Huh. On heels of duel threat (& Trump's HRC saber rattling) it's almost like these guys harbor punitive impulses toward non-compliant women.https://twitter.com/mattizcoop/status/890289306857811968

889938440195911685 2017-07-25 20:00:33 UTC <rtraister> After all my bitching about MSNBC I have to say that Ali Velshi just handed Jim Jordan's ass to him. It was terrific.
889930772983033863 2017-07-25 19:30:05 UTC <rtraister> Lily livered liars. And I wish them all, wish every single one of us, a future of high quality healthcare paid for by the state.
889929969572491264 2017-07-25 19:26:53 UTC <rtraister> That was horrifying hypocrisy & dishonesty dressed up in some white hot Aaron Sorkin horseshit. McCain just voted FOR acrimonious disorder.
889926755963867136 2017-07-25 19:14:07 UTC <rtraister> McCain lecturing on responsibilities of governance & adherence to protocols with scar on his forehead is the darkest fucking joke ever told.
889923636408320000 2017-07-25 19:01:43 UTC <rtraister> This is the approach of an entitled little boy who, if he can't win by the rules, decides the rules don't apply to him and breaks them.
889923282396491776 2017-07-25 19:00:19 UTC <rtraister> Now MSNBC discussion is of "magic" of Mitch McConnell. Wrong: this is not magic, not strategic genius...this is bullying exertion of force.
889919251288641536 2017-07-25 18:44:18 UTC <rtraister> Nope, MSNBC, I'm not "moved" by bipartisan concern for McCain's health. I'd be moved by bipartisan concern for health of millions of others.
889915884298522626 2017-07-25 18:30:55 UTC <rtraister> Turned on to watch vote. Protesters shouting "shame" are what I'm seeing/hearing. Everyone frozen. Thank you!
889911538521444352 2017-07-25 18:13:39 UTC <rtraister> Almost year ago, DNC, @RepGwenMoore, looking ahead, said, "I'm scared shitless." I keep remembering that & having to stop & catch my breath.
889910319505707008 2017-07-25 18:08:48 UTC <rtraister> @hilzoy @Paulashatsky That's @rgay you're complimenting, and I agree with every word!
889910145286852609 2017-07-25 18:08:07 UTC <rtraister> This strike me as one of the days that will retrospectively delineate past from future, as far as how the United States works.
889909132605571072 2017-07-25 18:04:05 UTC <rtraister> We're spinning way off any recognizable axis right now.

889656617305821186 2017-07-24 01:20:41 UTC <rtraister> Heroically returning from surgery to strip millions of healthcare would break sound barrier for monstrosity. So I hope that's not happening!
889572405739487232 2017-07-24 19:46:03 UTC <rtraister> @BlueBoxDave "women from the northeast" where there was (& is) abundance of unmarried/threatening women, is super loaded, in both directions you cite
889572119843155969 2017-07-24 19:44:55 UTC <rtraister> @BlueBoxDave Historically, there's been a fine line btw calling single/independent women ugly harridans & worrying about their out-of-control sexuality.
889571636286033920 2017-07-24 19:43:00 UTC <rtraister> @BlueBoxDave 19thc NE analogy gets to spinsters. Tho single women often vilified (even as sexless) bc of lack of male attachment, ie potential looseness

889569107506593793 2017-07-24 19:32:57 UTC <rtraister> Like the cartoon I just RTed, it feels very 19th century. (If there had been female senators in the 19th century. Which there weren't.)
889568850320261120 2017-07-24 19:31:55 UTC <rtraister> Besides bearing only a 30% relationship to reality, gripe re "female senators from the Northeast is something else:https://www.apnews.com/aa59b766a4294989a62c922112580af7/The-Latest:-Lawmaker-blames-female-senators-for-failed-bill?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP_Politics

887423597714833408 2017-07-18 21:27:27 UTC <rtraister> @piefuchs Yes, tho also true that anomalous female higher-ups aren't representative of what true equality would be like either. Still exceptions.

880436531357462528 2017-06-29 14:43:21 UTC <rtraister> @HamiltonCain Also it's not an overwhelming majority. 53 percent, down from 56 in 2012z
880436280173219843 2017-06-29 14:42:21 UTC <rtraister> @HamiltonCain Short version is that ww always vote Repub/support white patriarchal power structures from which they derive benefits/racialized advantages.

880073558130601985 2017-06-28 14:41:01 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal @leslieleeiii I've written many times re the very valid reasons to dislike HRC. Pushed back this am on misrepresentation of a piece, not on HRC criticism
880072958730829824 2017-06-28 14:38:38 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal @leslieleeiii I do understand that people genuinely despise her! (Fwiw Grouping her w husband as if they're the same is part of what I push back against).
880066579748319232 2017-06-28 14:13:18 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal I never watched the west wing. My concern isn't decorum; it's sexism.
880063664916746240 2017-06-28 14:01:43 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal I wasn't suggesting otherwise.
880062979781402624 2017-06-28 13:58:59 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal And for the record, at the time, even Freddie agreed that my point was a fair one, though I think he loathed the piece more generally.
880062845517430784 2017-06-28 13:58:27 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal I've never suggested that critique of HRC's war vote is anything other than valid & correct. I was responding to language used in argument.
880062625081634817 2017-06-28 13:57:35 UTC <rtraister> @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal I know. Argument many used on BEHALF of HRC. But relitigating primary isn't why I spoke up. Responding only to misrepresentation of my piece
880062179558518784 2017-06-28 13:55:49 UTC <rtraister> @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal I'm familiar with @kthalps piece & with critique of white feminism, history of deep racial inequities & appropriation w/in women's movement.
880061607732277249 2017-06-28 13:53:32 UTC <rtraister> @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal If by "centered around" you mean on 250 word graph in a 3000 word piece, sure.
880061015332925440 2017-06-28 13:51:11 UTC <rtraister> @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal Fair enough: it was about how people treated HRC. Not about fact that they criticized her, but HOW they criticized her (& her supporters).
880060542907543552 2017-06-28 13:49:18 UTC <rtraister> @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal It's ok. In general, I try not to have these arguments. I agree w you & Matt & Freddie & Zaid on a lot more than I disagree with you about.
880059586010464257 2017-06-28 13:45:30 UTC <rtraister> @FreddieDeboer @MattBruenig @ZaidJilani @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal Nope. That's also a misrepresentation of piece. Which again, you're free to disagree with. I'm just pushing back on lies about it.
880058463686082561 2017-06-28 13:41:03 UTC <rtraister> @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal Which is that it was about a Trump troll who was mean. Bc that's not refutation; it's misrepresentation. Feminizing, infantalizing misrep.
880058054305357824 2017-06-28 13:39:25 UTC <rtraister> @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal That's a story that disagrees with, not refuted it. And fine! Disagree! But I'm very curious about your specific claim about it...
880057755410812928 2017-06-28 13:38:14 UTC <rtraister> @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal You mean a story about progressive sexism that has mysteriously existed in two election cycles in which a Democratic woman has run?
880057516196904961 2017-06-28 13:37:17 UTC <rtraister> @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal Was it one who saw a story about progressive sexism & a year later assumed it was rooted in someone being "mean" to its female writer?
880055862324322304 2017-06-28 13:30:42 UTC <rtraister> @RosettaDrone @eshaLegal Which was the pro-Trump troll I cited as the basis for the story?
879710022489579520 2017-06-27 14:36:28 UTC <rtraister> This is great. Everyone check out @AnnaHolmes new site, @topicstories, launching today:https://twitter.com/AnnaHolmes/status/879360944484253696
879361840538681345 2017-06-26 15:32:55 UTC <rtraister> @cliffnuttman Which happens to intersect with Abrams' past work on outreach & strategy for upcoming campaign. Not about terms of primary.
879361614797041664 2017-06-26 15:32:01 UTC <rtraister> @cliffnuttman But this piece isn't about Abrams/Evans! That's for another time. This is about specific interest in outreach coming out of Ossoff campaign
879359667889197056 2017-06-26 15:24:17 UTC <rtraister> @cliffnuttman But it's not NE liberals who are behind this here. I'm the only NE liberal in this equation; this story came from people I was talking to.
879359207165841409 2017-06-26 15:22:27 UTC <rtraister> @cliffnuttman Or activating voters along purely racial lines. But I understand yr argument: it's why some of this has been tried & abandoned in past.
879358561150791681 2017-06-26 15:19:53 UTC <rtraister> @cliffnuttman How to engage voters who've been alienated. Also no one is suggesting ditching persuasion.
879358448793726977 2017-06-26 15:19:26 UTC <rtraister> @cliffnuttman But this piece and what people are advocating in it isn't pure registration. It's addressing exactly the issue you cite here.
879332027052564480 2017-06-26 13:34:27 UTC <rtraister> @cliffnuttman You're making counter argument cited here: $$$, difficult & risky. But point made here is also about moral necessity.
879331588592545792 2017-06-26 13:32:42 UTC <rtraister> @cliffnuttman Yes. They'd point out, though, that the population is changing quickly, especially in southern and western states.

856889819678605320 2017-04-25 15:17:07 UTC <rtraister> @annehelen My objection is to laying out blueprint-as Perez & Sanders did last week--for opening up party to anti-choicers as a strategy moving forward
856889671162486784 2017-04-25 15:16:32 UTC <rtraister> @annehelen I've lived my life voting for Dems with bad past records on choice, including for Kaine and for Biden, and being mad about it.
856889499548356612 2017-04-25 15:15:51 UTC <rtraister> @annehelen More broadly, though, I'd say my major objections as voiced in my piece are not about Health Mello specifically.
856889288679714816 2017-04-25 15:15:01 UTC <rtraister> @annehelen Easier to get better on women's rights when the regulations are in place already. Which is true of pols like Kaine too, of course.
856889005270544384 2017-04-25 15:13:53 UTC <rtraister> @annehelen But defense that he's now better on choice is iffy since he voted for restrictions that made NE one of the hardest places to get an abortion

856557238739185664 2017-04-24 17:15:34 UTC <rtraister> @WalkerBragman But even awarding that point against me; it does not negate the point I'm making now, which is not just about Mello (nor just about Bernie!)
856557124947726336 2017-04-24 17:15:07 UTC <rtraister> @WalkerBragman And if the charge is that I gave HRC a pass on Kaine, then fair enough. I think context was different, but get why you level that critique.

856529592550600705 2017-04-24 15:25:43 UTC <rtraister> @WalkerBragman @kendmil which is what Perez & Sanders were doing. Also isn't promise that this is supposed to be BETTER progressivism?
856529098524569600 2017-04-24 15:23:45 UTC <rtraister> @WalkerBragman @kendmil that's part of the point: important to be aggressive about harder line, not START from point of compromise
856528908480643073 2017-04-24 15:22:59 UTC <rtraister> @WalkerBragman @kendmil and precisely because Dems were running on a harder pro-choice line (opposition to Hyde) he had to support
856528551880929281 2017-04-24 15:21:34 UTC <rtraister> @WalkerBragman @kendmil I did answer! I didn't like the pick, but she was running on strongest pro choice platform in pres history.
856528161537970176 2017-04-24 15:20:01 UTC <rtraister> @DinahBernista @kayleebyeee compromise, which is what both Perez and Sanders were advocating last week.
856528019552440320 2017-04-24 15:19:28 UTC <rtraister> @DinahBernista @kayleebyeee i.e. Opposition to Hyde, he was forced to agree to support that harder line. Different from starting point of...
856527812110503936 2017-04-24 15:18:38 UTC <rtraister> @DinahBernista @kayleebyeee but w specific regard to Kaine/VP; I wasn't happy about pick but BECAUSE Ds had taken a harder line on choice...
856527426301698048 2017-04-24 15:17:06 UTC <rtraister> @DinahBernista @kayleebyeee hi! Kaine is mentioned; & piece is about Dem party's history w/ antichoice candidates that Pelosi is describing
856004875678867456 2017-04-22 04:40:40 UTC <rtraister> @linzlovesyou this kind of combines the fear of dying in nuclear war with nerdy Broadway twitter though.
856004058536136704 2017-04-22 04:37:25 UTC <rtraister> Seriously, tons of people on aggro post-mortem Twitter still missing out on the rich Sondheim gif potential:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8kxlNpyzrE
855903359542452224 2017-04-22 21:57:17 UTC <rtraister> @sfsclark the term reproductive justice includes all that and more.
855858955263889410 2017-04-22 19:00:50 UTC <rtraister> @ilyseh @mcbyrne I'm writing about Perez/DNC here too, plus long time Dem party denizens, including HRC, Howard Dean, etc
855827678036996096 2017-04-22 16:56:33 UTC <rtraister> In conclusion, may I recommend my own piece on this subject and this week's argument about it:http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/04/bernie-sanders-and-tom-perez-must-not-abandon-womens-rights.html
855827457596960769 2017-04-22 16:55:41 UTC <rtraister> Reproductive justice is at the heart of the fight for economic equality and anyone who suggests these fights are separate is wrong.
855826950111277061 2017-04-22 16:53:40 UTC <rtraister> Abortion/reproductive justice are not "cultural" issues; they are not "social" issues. This is about economic equality and public health.
855826326451781634 2017-04-22 16:51:11 UTC <rtraister> 75% of abortion seekers are poor/low income. Those most harmed by abortion restrictions & limited access are poor, disproportionately poc.
855825939078533120 2017-04-22 16:49:39 UTC <rtraister> Economic justice is not possible if half the population does not have reproductive (thus social, professional, bodily, economic) autonomy.
855825560735543296 2017-04-22 16:48:08 UTC <rtraister> "Commitment to economic justice" is not distinct from commitment to repro rights, characterized here, incredibly, as "cultural catechism."
855825290672697344 2017-04-22 16:47:04 UTC <rtraister> Error in this story repeats, rather than explains, the misrepresentation at the heart of this fight:https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/us/politics/bernie-sanders-democrats-nebraska.html?_r=0
855591802790977536 2017-04-21 01:19:16 UTC <rtraister> @kendmil @JD_Rhoades But have criticized her often on repro rights concessions in the past, including in this piece.
855591679348400129 2017-04-21 01:18:47 UTC <rtraister> @kendmil @JD_Rhoades Sorry I actually did answer but deleted because of typo & never rewrote: No, bc she ran on strongest prochoice platform in history.
855569263536607232 2017-04-21 23:49:42 UTC <rtraister> @kendmil but you are of course free to disagree vociferously with my opinions. Have a great weekend!
855567309011922944 2017-04-21 23:41:56 UTC <rtraister> @kendmil because Hillary Clinton is not currently claiming that she wants to radically transform the Democratic and lead it into the future.
855566333475528704 2017-04-21 23:38:04 UTC <rtraister> @kendmil Taking a compromised line from the start-as was being done this week-means that doesn't have to happen.
855566156442284037 2017-04-21 23:37:22 UTC <rtraister> @kendmil But crucially fact that platform/HRC were explicit in opposition to Hyde meant that Kaine had to affirm agreement with that stance
855565865768628224 2017-04-21 23:36:12 UTC <rtraister> @kendmil I wasn't happy about Kaine pick & cite both him & HRC's past remarks on abortion here.
855551355632615425 2017-04-21 22:38:33 UTC <rtraister> @EricLevitz indeed I mention Kaine in the piece
855543039607136258 2017-04-21 22:05:30 UTC <rtraister> @Myrnoproud1 you should read my piece!
855542211802529792 2017-04-21 22:02:13 UTC <rtraister> I wrote about this week's "Unity Tour" mess and history of Dems selling out repro rights. Everyone's sure to enjoy:http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/04/bernie-sanders-and-tom-perez-must-not-abandon-womens-rights.html
855132634623746050 2017-04-20 18:54:42 UTC <rtraister> Holy shit.https://twitter.com/irin/status/855127810276458496
855099312656744448 2017-04-20 16:42:17 UTC <rtraister> Huh.https://twitter.com/thr/status/855071178456805376
855043136212672512 2017-04-20 12:59:04 UTC <rtraister> Why wouldn't Bernie know what he thinks about Ossoff? Has he not paid attention? It's all very odd and tone deaf and badly timed.
855042483859972096 2017-04-20 12:56:28 UTC <rtraister> On Ossoff, I simply don't understand timing. Why now? The guy's running against KAREN HANDEL. The "I don't know" locution is also weird...
855041936083877888 2017-04-20 12:54:18 UTC <rtraister> I agree, tho might not call it a purity test. I can't fathom a definition of progressivism that encompasses Mello.  https://twitter.com/sbagen/status/854877640364359680
854797995103092736 2017-04-19 20:44:58 UTC <rtraister> Didn't want today to pass without noting how proud I am to work w Fox's worst nightmare, @gabrielsherman & our shared editor, @LaurenKern1.
854764438712451076 2017-04-19 18:31:37 UTC <rtraister> @belladepaulo Thanks, Bella, for your wise words within!
854756587059249152 2017-04-19 18:00:25 UTC <rtraister> Reupping: in NY you no longer have to be having "regular intercourse" in order to be deemed infertile by insurershttp://nymag.com/thecut/2017/04/andrew-cuomo-infertility-coverage-same-sex-couples.html?mid=twitter_cut
854737043116756992 2017-04-19 16:42:45 UTC <rtraister> @KatieANYC yes! I'm just reacting because now it's real, not just a rumor
854736440147816448 2017-04-19 16:40:22 UTC <rtraister> @KatieANYC this is from this morning.

854712863725948928 2017-04-19 15:06:41 UTC <rtraister> A good thing: Cuomo mandating that insurers cover infertility treatments for single & same-sex prospective parents: http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/04/andrew-cuomo-infertility-coverage-same-sex-couples.html
854684655576125442 2017-04-19 13:14:35 UTC <rtraister> There should be a children's book that shows comparatives on Trump scale: failing, tremendous, winners, losers.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/854676780527079425

851877560422199297 2017-04-11 19:20:12 UTC <rtraister> A day on which you have to get past even ONE "Hitler clarification" is probably a bad day.https://twitter.com/BraddJaffy/status/851875534493581314

851861383578890240 2017-04-11 18:15:55 UTC <rtraister> Do you think this was special for Passover? Or as Karen Handel might say: happy new year.https://twitter.com/braddjaffy/status/851859257490366465
851801811694563332 2017-04-11 14:19:12 UTC <rtraister> Which isn't to say that current moment doesn't demand/reward frank profanity from pols, just pointing out it's not purely post-Trump.
851800154994814976 2017-04-11 14:12:37 UTC <rtraister> Interesting, though in case of KG, it's not wholly new. She uses f-word & writes of propensity for cursing (& her grandma's) in 2014 memoir.https://twitter.com/AndreaDrusch/status/851790332920553473

850334524131217411 2017-04-07 13:08:43 UTC <rtraister> The deployment of some "beautiful" weapons, a couple of words strung together grammatically, and poof! We have ourselves a president.

833308399366455296 2017-02-19 13:32:59 UTC <rtraister> This is crucial too: animating force of Trump campaign was punishing aggression. Promises of deportation forces, walls & female comeuppance.https://twitter.com/amandakhurley/status/833306747808911360
833307908750340096 2017-02-19 13:31:02 UTC <rtraister> @nytimes @holm_stephan Yep, but I'm not comparing feelings to feelings. I'm comparing feelings assaulted to being assaulted.
833307427302944769 2017-02-19 13:29:07 UTC <rtraister> So it's too bad about Meryl Streep; I really didn't like that speech much either tbh. But maybe some larger context might help?
833306454190874624 2017-02-19 13:25:15 UTC <rtraister> And of course the dozen women who have claimed that the president literally assaulted them, before getting elected anyway.
833306334330228736 2017-02-19 13:24:46 UTC <rtraister> The kind of actual damage that will be done to human beings when healthcare & welfare & legal services programs are done away with.

833304254710419456 2017-02-19 13:16:31 UTC <rtraister> Such an odd angle when the literal & rhetorical aggression coming from administration and from the president himself has been overwhelming.
833303913256386560 2017-02-19 13:15:09 UTC <rtraister> "Conservative voters said they felt assaulted." But no real acknowledgement of those who are in fact under assault.

833092728850366465 2017-02-18 23:15:59 UTC <rtraister> Is that a "Hillary for Prison" sign? I mean, I know it is. But these signs were handed out by the, uh, campaign or whatever this is, right?

818860113352151045 2017-01-10 16:40:39 UTC <rtraister> @rebel19 Open window, clear view onto motivating ideas behind this country's past present and clearly its future.
818859916769325056 2017-01-10 16:39:52 UTC <rtraister> Sessions & Graham just cooly agreed to end DACA & then chatted in detail about how much it's hurt to be thought of as racists. USA 2016.
818859474987483136 2017-01-10 16:38:07 UTC <rtraister> That exchange, about the pain of having been deemed racist, tells you SO MUCH THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT AMERICA AND THE MEN WHO RUN IT.
818859302928707586 2017-01-10 16:37:26 UTC <rtraister> Sessions: "You have a southern name, you come from south Alabama, that sounds WORSE to some people!" This is horrible, horrible parody.
818859226550468608 2017-01-10 16:37:07 UTC <rtraister> Graham & Sessions commiserate on how it feels to be caricatured as southern racists. "How does that make you feel?" "It does not feel good."
818858765265076228 2017-01-10 16:35:17 UTC <rtraister> Graham just said he felt it "pretty clear" that Russian hacks changed election outcome. What a weird conviction to hold as you q Trump's AG.
818857972814245890 2017-01-10 16:32:09 UTC <rtraister> Sessions re what to do w families post-DACA: "we've been put in a difficult position" Yeah, wow, it must be terrible, the position you're in
818857423767216128 2017-01-10 16:29:58 UTC <rtraister> Sessions: it would be constitutional to end DACA.
818849033338978305 2017-01-10 15:56:37 UTC <rtraister> "If you believe same-sex marriage is settled law and a woman's right to choose is not, what's the difference?" -- Feinstein.
818848743864811520 2017-01-10 15:55:28 UTC <rtraister> Feinstein framing of q re abortion wrt her own pre-Roe memories is crucial, exactly kind of necessary recollection I write about this week.
818848203713970178 2017-01-10 15:53:19 UTC <rtraister> I don't think Sessions REALLY appreciates the question about Hyde and abortion services for victims of sex trafficking, do you?
818846703075913728 2017-01-10 15:47:22 UTC <rtraister> Why was there a line of questioning regarding further Clinton investigations? Because it's what lights up the right, that's why.
818829106766868481 2017-01-10 14:37:26 UTC <rtraister> @TheCut I wrote at length about the near future (& not so distant past) of reproductive healthcare access: http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/01/reproductive-rights-abortion-access-in-america.html?mid=twitter-share-thecut via @thecut
818795670886903809 2017-01-10 12:24:35 UTC <rtraister> @rebel19 bingo
818665703008075776 2017-01-09 03:48:08 UTC <rtraister> @rebel19 did you read the Times story? I...don't know what to say

818664288143474688 2017-01-09 03:42:30 UTC <rtraister> Please stop suggesting that abortion rights are distinct from "economic issues."https://twitter.com/CNN/status/818656606242086914
818497171767132164 2017-01-09 16:38:27 UTC <rtraister> And if you don't, then again: that's where portions of left and right are meeting right now.
818497044365066240 2017-01-09 16:37:56 UTC <rtraister> It's not rational if you believe left must tackle ID biases & inequalities around which nation was built & which it continues to exploit.
818496669264318468 2017-01-09 16:36:27 UTC <rtraister> There are plenty of ways to gussy it up and contextualize it so that it seems like rational left strategy, but...it's not.
818496147253760001 2017-01-09 16:34:23 UTC <rtraister> This anti-identity politics thing is where left meets right in ways that a piece like this makes pretty clear.
818494859082428417 2017-01-09 16:29:15 UTC <rtraister> So "I care about violence against everyone, not just women" is All Lives Matter, right? http://nyti.ms/2jlge4M
818220397615345669 2017-01-08 22:18:39 UTC <rtraister> Feels like an instance at which "What the actual fuck?" is worth writing out in full.  https://twitter.com/adamserwer/status/818196039433854977

817481329067655169 2017-01-06 21:21:51 UTC <rtraister> Someday her opponents should reckon w how much of their support derived largely from dizzying pleasure people take in imagining her defeated
817481028499607563 2017-01-06 21:20:39 UTC <rtraister> I can't/can totally believe people have already started imagining a new race for HRC to run in so they can get back to fantasizing her loss,
817193853799305216 2017-01-05 02:19:32 UTC <rtraister> .@Powells is sending All the Single Ladies to PEOTUS. Maybe he'll guess wrong about its title & read it by accident http://www.powells.com/presidential-reading/
817155335010054147 2017-01-05 23:46:28 UTC <rtraister> @BlueBoxDave I know! You're like the Jacobin of the right.

817094510643658756 2017-01-05 19:44:46 UTC <rtraister> Might go further than @jbouie here; maybe we're learning that in the eyes of some, racism might not even BE a blemish, but central to appealhttps://twitter.com/rtraister/status/817093799272976384

811581650643644416 2016-12-21 14:38:38 UTC <rtraister> Totally fair to loathe my work & critique me publicly. But be clear about who here is doing over-emotional outraged tweet-attacks.
811580909505941505 2016-12-21 14:35:41 UTC <rtraister> i.e. descriptions of my "outraged" "tweet-attack." But they're referring to a year-old tweet expressing mild surprise/dismay over a tv intvw
811580480294359040 2016-12-21 14:33:59 UTC <rtraister> Also, this bizarre, randomly picked fight is great example of how some critics discredit feminist critique as high-strung and emotional.

811579609582018561 2016-12-21 14:30:32 UTC <rtraister> It could not have been, as @lhfang insinuates later, voiced in "coordination" w HRC campaign. That's both silly and demonstrably false.

802605598118440960 2016-11-26 20:11:00 UTC <rtraister> @somanyshrimp @jaycaspiankang You may be right that it's only opinion in elite left media, but i think it's fair (crucial?) to pay attention
802605267154243584 2016-11-26 20:09:42 UTC <rtraister> @somanyshrimp @jaycaspiankang well that's a whole other conversation.
802602098655371264 2016-11-26 19:57:06 UTC <rtraister> @jaycaspiankang @somanyshrimp and getting the blame for the failure/for inspiring a backlash
802601988991176705 2016-11-26 19:56:40 UTC <rtraister> @jaycaspiankang @somanyshrimp well, & that they are the base of the party, the one doing the labor of persuasion & activism & support
802601613332480000 2016-11-26 19:55:10 UTC <rtraister> @jaycaspiankang but reading it as you are, as in their hard work was ON BEHALF OF party, your critique is spot on.
802601298336116737 2016-11-26 19:53:55 UTC <rtraister> @jaycaspiankang that's fair, tho as hard working heart of those who opposed Trump/voted Dem, I'd stand by it
802600218336301056 2016-11-26 19:49:38 UTC <rtraister> @javits @jaycaspiankang it's also true that there were crim justice activists In HRC coalition (& @Javits, tho that's not what that graf was about)
802599669264162817 2016-11-26 19:47:27 UTC <rtraister> @jaycaspiankang but my point there was about them getting blamed for Trumpism when their work is in opposition to it
802599244246827008 2016-11-26 19:45:46 UTC <rtraister> @jaycaspiankang as I said, your point that BLM falls well outside of Dem coalition is well taken.
802597222194020352 2016-11-26 19:37:43 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell the passage JCK was critiquing wasn't only in ref to CTH. Was more broadly about Lilla, frame of "ID politics" as problematic
802594228878667776 2016-11-26 19:25:50 UTC <rtraister> Fingers pointed at those who WERE in campaign & get written over & those who've agitated outside or alongside it, but get blame for backlash
802590836542279681 2016-11-26 19:12:21 UTC <rtraister> Which is another way in which those who worked hardest against rise of Trump, from w/in & w/out campaign, get blamed/misrepresented
802590462603313152 2016-11-26 19:10:52 UTC <rtraister> There were plenty of activists, agitators from left, those who simply do work of resisting Trump, who get written over as center left/elite
802589888264683520 2016-11-26 19:08:35 UTC <rtraister> Part of point, the part that was specifically about Clinton coalition/support, is that it is NOT all center right elite driven or populated
802589566112821248 2016-11-26 19:07:18 UTC <rtraister> But also, graph that IS about who was at Javits, contra JCK, is reported. I was there, I spoke to the people I describe.
802588850497396736 2016-11-26 19:04:27 UTC <rtraister> But those activists are nonetheless being blamed for inspiring a reaction that brought us with Trumpism, and this passage was about that.
802588666749034496 2016-11-26 19:03:44 UTC <rtraister> Very fair & correct to point out that many activists, especially BLM, work (way) outside Dem party & are rightly critical of it.
802588316344336385 2016-11-26 19:02:20 UTC <rtraister> graph cited was not in reference to people at Javits. I'd moved back to larger response, blaming ID politics/activism for election result
802587910411153408 2016-11-26 19:00:43 UTC <rtraister> A long thread from @jaycaspiankang criticizing this passage in my piece is well worth thinking about. Couple of responses threaded below: https://twitter.com/jaycaspiankang/status/802523020535287808

802232788678311936 2016-11-25 19:29:36 UTC <rtraister> I mean this really would be like the second biggest scam Jill Stein ever pulled.
801821996292116480 2016-11-24 16:17:15 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps he's done plenty right by me, including pushing HRC in the right (left) direction. But I'm also critical of some of his approaches.
801649109765648384 2016-11-23 04:50:16 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps I quoted it precisely because I wanted to note that the reports on his comments had been imprecise.
801648566662033408 2016-11-23 04:48:06 UTC <rtraister> He also says that HRC is "somebody who has fans who are psychologically tormented, weak, elite freaks." I'm describing those fans.https://twitter.com/deep_beige/status/801517972963655684
801647825985605633 2016-11-23 04:45:10 UTC <rtraister> No. His description of who was crying at Javits was false. He claimed they were all donors; this is who was there & who he was insulting.https://twitter.com/deep_beige/status/801517972963655684
801527614544498690 2016-11-23 20:47:29 UTC <rtraister> @TheCut @mcorcoran3 Totally agree that blame of HRC is fair. I'm writing here about a line of critique I think is unfair.

801507335835451392 2016-11-23 19:26:54 UTC <rtraister> @FreddieDeboer when they call everyone who was at Javits elite freaks, that's who they're critiquing. Also, this graph is not all about them

789552233671172096 2016-10-21 19:41:36 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray But journalists I know want to keep writing about the people they cover, not working for them.
789551820666441728 2016-10-21 19:39:57 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray things are complicated. I don't know all the answers but I don't think you or anyone else does either.
789551656081977344 2016-10-21 19:39:18 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray right! There'd be better candidates. But would you fault them for considering? Maybe. Maybe I would. I don't know.
789550201044344836 2016-10-21 19:33:31 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Er, not in my experience or that of truly any other journalist I know who covers HRC? (Again, I don't know them all)
789549887671132161 2016-10-21 19:32:17 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray I just don't want to make a blanket statement that I think it would always be bad.
789549834890014720 2016-10-21 19:32:04 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Anyway, I don't want to get on the side of "yes, hire the writers!" because largely I'm with you on this.
789549744750198784 2016-10-21 19:31:42 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray If Bernie were pres & hired Jacobin writers, would you think it an automatically terrible idea? Not sure I would.
789549444840718337 2016-10-21 19:30:31 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Perhaps. And perhaps a talented person gets hired to do a crucial job re an issue they've spent years writing about.
789548479190278144 2016-10-21 19:26:41 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Oh man, I wouldn't tell anyone that. Lots of smart people have worked for pols & in journalism.
789547721325674496 2016-10-21 19:23:40 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Agree. In fact those are points I made in my earlier tweets.
789545538664468480 2016-10-21 19:15:00 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Or where that was the case, in the manner you describe it, in my experience.
789545426311585793 2016-10-21 19:14:33 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray I didn't say I believe in meritocracy. I said I've never worked in places where access was key to promotion.
789545245893660672 2016-10-21 19:13:50 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray I'm wrong that I know the differences, or that your theory was flawed or am I just wrong about everything?
789544524620165120 2016-10-21 19:10:58 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray & this may indeed be the way that the profession works at some institutions. Not at those where I've worked.
789544256889352192 2016-10-21 19:09:54 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray My comparison was only to suggest your theory re incentives was flawed. Again, I covered both, know the differences.
789543016386162688 2016-10-21 19:04:58 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Let's just go back to you being convinced of things that I will continue to think are wrong. Be well.
789542903848792064 2016-10-21 19:04:31 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Anyway, we will never see eye to eye on this and I have to work.
789542470623322112 2016-10-21 19:02:48 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Yes! Different elections. But your idea that she was favorite thus media supported her does not hold up. At all.
789542204201111552 2016-10-21 19:01:45 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Their actual "work" is talking to journalists & bloggers. This doesn't mean those people were "working with" them.
789541994884374528 2016-10-21 19:00:55 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray I literally wrote a book about 2008. She was considered inevitable going in. Supers moved away from her in huge #s.
789541321040076800 2016-10-21 18:58:14 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray there is no evidence of that that I have seen anywhere.
789541161635569664 2016-10-21 18:57:36 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray It's not about disagreement. I covered it. She was considered "inevitable" in 2008. Obama beat her. Bernie did not.
789540054137970688 2016-10-21 18:53:12 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Nope. Most of them weren't.
789539762411540480 2016-10-21 18:52:02 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray For one thing, it seems like several of the people cited didn't even get on the call.
789539619180339200 2016-10-21 18:51:28 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Of course not. And there's lots to complain about in terms of clubbiness. But this does not strike me as an example.
789539281744326656 2016-10-21 18:50:08 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Hillary was always going to win in 2008, too. But lots of these very same people were not on her good side.
789539254552686592 2016-10-21 18:50:01 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray I just cannot stress enough how firmly I do not believe that that was the formulation here.
789534925687033856 2016-10-21 18:32:49 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray so right, this is about Bernie v Hillary. What it's not is about, far as I can tell (I'm behind!) is journalism.
789534130312798208 2016-10-21 18:29:40 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray I have also not caught up on everyone's reactions. On tight deadlines myself.
789533744847814657 2016-10-21 18:28:08 UTC <rtraister> No. I haven't read it yet.
789533368648142852 2016-10-21 18:26:38 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray Not wholly. Their perspective on HRC/campaign/women likely led them to be writing about this to begin with.
789531970061631488 2016-10-21 18:21:05 UTC <rtraister> sure does not exclude it. Fair. But this to me shows no signs of collusion.
789531545900056576 2016-10-21 18:19:23 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray journalists who write on issues the campaign thinks are relevant to perspective they want out there? Sure.
789531112657805312 2016-10-21 18:17:40 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray no. I put "known allies" in quotes because I was critiquing the phrase itself which I think doesn't apply.
789530943623163904 2016-10-21 18:17:00 UTC <rtraister> @Glucks_drache if your sources are off the record you are literally not allowed to cite them.
789530796327575552 2016-10-21 18:16:25 UTC <rtraister> @Glucks_drache they were already writing or thinking if writing critically, or had written critically on related issues.
789530311101145088 2016-10-21 18:14:29 UTC <rtraister> @Glucks_drache No evidence that anyone was writing critically at the direction of the campaign.
789529923643904000 2016-10-21 18:12:57 UTC <rtraister> @Glucks_drache again, emails show journalism, not collusion.
789529474861830148 2016-10-21 18:11:10 UTC <rtraister> @noahkayray "known allies." Comms dept job to ID & reach journos whose work they deem fair/perspective favorable. Doesn't=allies
789528567180820480 2016-10-21 18:07:33 UTC <rtraister> because the call is off the record. These are the rules of journalism, not any one political campaign.
789528128402128896 2016-10-21 18:05:49 UTC <rtraister> @Glucks_drache journalists are SUPPOSED to be in close contact with people they cover, some of that contact unrevealed.
789527559474180096 2016-10-21 18:03:33 UTC <rtraister> Are those talking points elucidating? Do they mirror what the journo thought to be the case going into the call anyway?
789526082290651136 2016-10-21 17:57:41 UTC <rtraister> @JessicaValenti "calls w/o disclosure" you mean off the record calls? Yes, journalism includes that all the time.
789525545734332416 2016-10-21 17:55:33 UTC <rtraister> @Glucks_drache on a press call for the campaign's perspective. If anything, annoying from journalists perspective to be put on a group call.
789525413240401920 2016-10-21 17:55:01 UTC <rtraister> @Glucks_drache in response to establishment comments, were herded together (along w others campaign thought would be interested?)...
789525317815853056 2016-10-21 17:54:39 UTC <rtraister> @Glucks_drache I see no evidence that this was about "coordinating attacks." Journos reached out to campaign for comment/background...

785323891971555328 2016-10-09 03:39:41 UTC <rtraister> Could she sense how close he was standing to her? "Yes, yes I could...he was very PRESENT."

785319312571662336 2016-10-09 03:21:29 UTC <rtraister> FYI also don't worry about sexual assault because Giuliani also has assured us that "men say stupid things in locker rooms."

785312964215791616 2016-10-09 02:56:15 UTC <rtraister> Tonight rock bottom Trump expectations paid off for him. He was a mendacious, sniffing, predatory ogre. Media consensus: impressive!

785289883367636994 2016-10-09 01:24:32 UTC <rtraister> I'm trying to take notes on this and I can't. It's like a dump of every anti-HRC narrative from right & left over three decades.

778712195227983872 2016-09-21 21:47:09 UTC <rtraister> Great work, America. Tremendous story-telling!https://twitter.com/PeterAlexander/status/778700650834038788
778688428766482436 2016-09-21 20:12:43 UTC <rtraister> @vajohna Hey, my fingers are crossed. And HRC's been saying she can win Texas since the spring.
778687136518111232 2016-09-21 20:07:35 UTC <rtraister> Still hoping...https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/778686568055787521
778682960144838656 2016-09-21 19:50:59 UTC <rtraister> Anyway, everything I just tweeted about @jbouie has written about 100x times better, I'm just mad re s&f and that this argument persists.
778682506837045249 2016-09-21 19:49:11 UTC <rtraister> @hamilton1_burt which part?
778682212958871557 2016-09-21 19:48:01 UTC <rtraister> And, in conclusion, Samantha Bee is not a bluestocking, that is nuts. I just think he must like the word.
778681957936791552 2016-09-21 19:47:00 UTC <rtraister> But the balms Trump is offering all structurally advantage white men.
778681818748813313 2016-09-21 19:46:27 UTC <rtraister> And some of those supporters surely ALSO feel very real, very serious economic anxiety & experience real disadvantages of their own.
778681636183355393 2016-09-21 19:45:43 UTC <rtraister> All ideas/policies that reinforce white (male) supremacy. And supporters are responding to them, whether or not they yell epithets.
778681178219958272 2016-09-21 19:43:54 UTC <rtraister> Also, of course: deportation, criminalization of immigrants/poc, reduction in civil liberties, anti-terror racial profiling, 20 week bans...
778680848933466114 2016-09-21 19:42:36 UTC <rtraister> Proposing federal stop & frisk is perfect example, because it's an actual policy proposal that would reinforce persistent inequalities.
778680404446371844 2016-09-21 19:40:50 UTC <rtraister> It's also about promised, structural and ideological reinforcement of biases & white (and male) supremacy coming from candidate.
778680174095179777 2016-09-21 19:39:55 UTC <rtraister> It's not about whether Trump supporters are all people who'd yell epithets, or cheer them--they're certainly not (tho those people exist)
778679755545509888 2016-09-21 19:38:15 UTC <rtraister> re: stop & frisk, racism & ongoing argument about whether Trump's support is built on it--it is not about individual character.

778595860221403136 2016-09-21 14:04:53 UTC <rtraister> @NateSilver538 @DemFromCT Fair. But I think the questioning of model is a relatively small number of people I see yelling at/questioning him
778595052582998016 2016-09-21 14:01:40 UTC <rtraister> & I bet many claiming that hesitation has nothing to do w gender are same who don't want to acknowledge Trump support tied in part to racism https://twitter.com/stays72/status/778593016990752769
778594518845255681 2016-09-21 13:59:33 UTC <rtraister> Agree that's the other half. A hesitation to enthusiastically get behind, or acknowledge/amplify the enthusiasm that does exist for, HRC. https://twitter.com/stays72/status/778593016990752769

778591045814722560 2016-09-21 13:45:45 UTC <rtraister> Guessing it's a sign of how reluctant we are to truly absorb the reality of where we are as a nation, what might be motivating voters.
778590757007593474 2016-09-21 13:44:36 UTC <rtraister> Strange animus toward @NateSilver538 right now for showing v close race. Reluctance to see this contest as (horrifyingly) tight is intense.

778318422216216576 2016-09-20 19:42:26 UTC <rtraister> @HillaryKelly How many times have Congressional Repubs voted to defund PP in past eight years? How many state laws have been proposed?
778318329169797120 2016-09-20 19:42:04 UTC <rtraister> @HillaryKelly Oh, I'm sure. But it shouldn't take expert eyes to notice issue that's biggest unifying motivator for Republicans.
778305495107039232 2016-09-20 18:51:04 UTC <rtraister> @HillaryKelly I think that repro rights embattled at a state level is automatically a presidential issue when there are SCOTUS seats open.
778263319094423552 2016-09-20 16:03:29 UTC <rtraister> During primary, excuse for no repro rights Qs was that candidates didn't differ on issue. So why no interest now?http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/20/opinion/questions-for-clinton-and-trump-you-choose.html?smid=tw-share

775174345215868928 2016-09-11 03:29:00 UTC <rtraister> @jonlovett "September swoon" sounds like a seasonal cocktail. Bourbon, maple syrup--soothing for those suffering from persistent dry cough..
775173203131928576 2016-09-11 03:24:28 UTC <rtraister> @jonlovett oh.
775172702806110208 2016-09-11 03:22:29 UTC <rtraister> @jonlovett what is this even from?
775149519910608897 2016-09-11 01:50:21 UTC <rtraister> This is so brilliant and so is Bull Durham.https://twitter.com/nymag/status/774149929858048000
774577717085933568 2016-09-10 11:58:13 UTC <rtraister> 100%. He's exposing often obscured biases as stark, and seems like she's...intentionally amplifying that exposure. https://twitter.com/alittlelilypad/status/774575674312888320
774576848529481729 2016-09-10 11:54:46 UTC <rtraister> This is a real part of what Trump is drawing out. A scary view of degree to which country is far from over inequities on which it was built.
774575454099533824 2016-09-10 11:49:13 UTC <rtraister> But horrified reaction is a reminder that many Americans are still more upset about being called racist & sexist than about racism & sexism.
774575200063066112 2016-09-10 11:48:13 UTC <rtraister> Taking it to supporters-including compassion for those who are hurting & desperate for change, not in it for hate-could be mistake, or not.
774574752132435968 2016-09-10 11:46:26 UTC <rtraister> None of this seems at odds with recent campaign messaging-being frank about biases Trump is channeling.
774351778527711236 2016-09-09 21:00:25 UTC <rtraister> @veggiebratsch It's possible that you're right. I just think he would have been clobbered.
774343373545152512 2016-09-09 20:27:01 UTC <rtraister> @caitlinbk I don't even think he's accusing her of faking it, just of imagining it to have had meaning?
774343203965267969 2016-09-09 20:26:21 UTC <rtraister> @veggiebratsch Oh, for reasons too long for Twitter; it's just my guess that he would've been savaged in general election. Could be wrong!

773237473837277184 2016-09-06 19:12:34 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell I'm not exactly mounting a defense-she's erred! But some context as to why & how we don't hear her talking about anything else
773236968050331648 2016-09-06 19:10:33 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell She has plans & she LOVES talking about them. But they get no coverage except notes that she's boring. So she talks Trump.
773236396941344769 2016-09-06 19:08:17 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell Right! And fair! Except no analysis of why people haven't heard about policy ideas she does have that would improve lives.
773234602349568001 2016-09-06 19:01:09 UTC <rtraister> 5. Anyway, I see this story has gotten pushback, but unlike so much garbage published recently, I think it's smart and fair.
773233387540742144 2016-09-06 18:56:20 UTC <rtraister> 4. albeit a wonky one--daycare, paid leave, mental health-not much coverage. Media rewards focus on Trump in a way that's shaped her focus.
773232971511959552 2016-09-06 18:54:41 UTC <rtraister> 3. AND when it comes to @GlennThrush's very fair criticism of making it about Trump: it should be noted that when she HAS laid out a vision

771349501785309184 2016-09-01 14:10:26 UTC <rtraister> I love the New York Times. I read it every day. I rely on it for my work. I have written for it. But today I'm so appalled by it.
771349207861133312 2016-09-01 14:09:16 UTC <rtraister> But more than any gender angle, bizarro-world legitimizing of (admiration for?!) racist authoritarianism is as chilling as speech itself.
771347812244152320 2016-09-01 14:03:44 UTC <rtraister> And I guess what I see here, with accounts of this fucking horrifying man's "spirited" & "audacious" approach, is the same thing in reverse
771347500548689922 2016-09-01 14:02:29 UTC <rtraister> About the briskness of their pace, the jewel-tones of their jackets, their confident carriage, that ADD UP to portraits of shrill bitchiness
771347291210969088 2016-09-01 14:01:39 UTC <rtraister> I wrote recently about the words used about women politicians in the press-not the big ones, like "bitch" or even "shrill"-but small ones
771346870694182912 2016-09-01 13:59:59 UTC <rtraister> I guess part of that includes seeing promises of targeted removal & forced assimilation as "spirited" and "audacious" by major press organs
771346465658642437 2016-09-01 13:58:22 UTC <rtraister> I know it's wrong to do Hitler/Holocaust comparisons, but watching last night helped me to viscerally understand rise of authoritarian power
771346027123277824 2016-09-01 13:56:38 UTC <rtraister> Because the speech I watched last night was built around chilling, authoritarian, racist, xenophobic promises of punishment.
771345635572318208 2016-09-01 13:55:05 UTC <rtraister> Still, let's consider the words "audacious" & "spirited," which remain up front here, more closely... https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/771293735833444352

769318985586339841 2016-08-26 23:41:54 UTC <rtraister> @chrislhayes @Davidw76 I don't think that's true. I think the influence of the ex pres was always selling point.

760207848186019841 2016-08-01 20:17:29 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Also, thinking about your "where does that end?" question, I am reminded of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's answer to a similar query:
760206617853980677 2016-08-01 20:12:36 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz representational government is not about individual mirrored identity, rather about proportional representation of a population
760180074662531072 2016-08-01 18:27:07 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz I didn't say that.
760172460960575488 2016-08-01 17:56:52 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Ideally it would end with identity not being an impediment to power/representation, for any gender, ethnicity, sexuality, etc
760172226738057216 2016-08-01 17:55:56 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Are you really asking "where does that end?" about moving toward government that better represents the people?
760170266718834688 2016-08-01 17:48:09 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Nope. I'm saying that representative government should roughly represent population its governing. Ours never has.
760166106468347904 2016-08-01 17:31:37 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz and has dulled interest in getting anywhere closer to truly representational government, is a sad distortion of that argument.
760165926025228288 2016-08-01 17:30:54 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz I actually agree with you about that. But way you framed it in piece, suggesting that handful of women 1sts has satisfied....
760165777806884868 2016-08-01 17:30:19 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Look, I get the argument you're making here: that young voters don't feel same urgency bc have grown up w/ Obama, HRC, etc.
760165398532722688 2016-08-01 17:28:48 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz So your hope is that we would always have a (slightly) majority female country represented by majority male government?
760164728643710976 2016-08-01 17:26:09 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz that we're all full up on firsts.
760164232382078976 2016-08-01 17:24:10 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Who is saying that diversity should be THE determinative factor? My critique isn't of HRC objectors. It's to your argument...
760163415067328513 2016-08-01 17:20:55 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz This is like saying "I don't see race," right? But if you don't see race or gender, you don't see clearly. Bc they've mattered.
760162833019592704 2016-08-01 17:18:37 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Not even when talking about representation in a 51% female nation? No rough, back-of-the-envelope goal? Me, I'd go with 50%.
760161773970395136 2016-08-01 17:14:24 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz But: IT'S NOT COMMONPLACE. This is my point. Also that investment in better/more diverse representation isn't about "novelty."
760160652430303232 2016-08-01 17:09:57 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz But extra strange when your reasoning for disassociation w gender is because we're all full up on women! When we're...not.
760160412763557888 2016-08-01 17:09:00 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz At the same time, notion that impressions of HRC's career and candidacy can have NOTHING to do with gender is bananas.
760160298556878849 2016-08-01 17:08:32 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz I think the notion that most people are out there celebrating her JUST because of gender is a straw-woman.
760159736855719936 2016-08-01 17:06:19 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz That's the argument I think doesn't reflect an investment in representational government as good or crucial to democracy.
760159383040983041 2016-08-01 17:04:54 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Right! Your argument is we've collected so many women, even a HISPANIC woman on SCOTUS, that it's not exciting anymore.
760158127924862976 2016-08-01 16:59:55 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz I've written thousands of words on Sarah Palin presidency. What does it have to do with the piece you just published?
760157997507211265 2016-08-01 16:59:24 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Like we've judged all prior presidents on their individual merits and not on their identities?
760155377103212544 2016-08-01 16:48:59 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Are you not arguing that HRC is late to the party because there are comparative handful of other women in power so...ho hum?
760155020411166721 2016-08-01 16:47:34 UTC <rtraister> @KayHymowitz Are you not explicitly arguing that we're bored of firsts i.e. those who are different from white men who have preceded?

760110171741970432 2016-08-01 13:49:21 UTC <rtraister> @familyunequal have to start from assumption that white men don't themselves have IDs/their history of power has nothing to do w race/gender
760107538947928064 2016-08-01 13:38:54 UTC <rtraister> Thing about this is its premise is wholly disassociated from notion that our government should be representative.http://www.city-journal.org/html/end-womens-history-14666.html
760107183350681601 2016-08-01 13:37:29 UTC <rtraister> I mean, there's a HISPANIC woman (italicized for...exoticism, extra wacky identity?) on SCOTUS, so 1st female presidential nominee a snooze.
760106364584730624 2016-08-01 13:34:14 UTC <rtraister> Read @KayHymowitz for view of non-white-male leaders as collect-em-all novelties; having more than 1 of each? Boring http://www.city-journal.org/html/end-womens-history-14666.html

759395419621392385 2016-07-30 14:29:11 UTC <rtraister> I note that mostly bc I think it's easier to condemn simplistic identity politics arguments when you're imagining that someone has made them

758052481289089030 2016-07-26 21:32:50 UTC <rtraister> @mariabustillos @Greengage There are similarities btw 2 situations (& other convention fights) but also differences in expressions/context.
758052274589622273 2016-07-26 21:32:00 UTC <rtraister> @mariabustillos @Greengage But each had tremendous historical significance & carried symbolic baggage that amplified devotions/resentments.

758035106170896385 2016-07-26 20:23:47 UTC <rtraister> @mariabustillos Yes, I know.
758031742750130176 2016-07-26 20:10:25 UTC <rtraister> There's more vilification of opponent, not just frustrations, at least inside the arena. In 08, that was mainly outside. @mariabustillos
758030702143270912 2016-07-26 20:06:17 UTC <rtraister> Their disruption is greater, & inside arena as well as outside, but undergirded by similar resentments/frustrations. @mariabustillos
758030486748930048 2016-07-26 20:05:26 UTC <rtraister> But yes, more broadly, many Bernie hold-outs here recall HRC's protesters in 08. @mariabustillos

757579648339410944 2016-07-25 14:13:57 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons ah, well, that's HRC. Check out my Charlie Brown tweets from Friday for summation of my life spent caring about her.
757579286509457408 2016-07-25 14:12:31 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons @hayleykrischer I guess my point is I feel there are way bigger things to feel ambivalent about than this. But of course ymmv.
757578834527002624 2016-07-25 14:10:43 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons @hayleykrischer also whole DNC story is being read weirdly. Hack confirms there was NO conspiracy to rig, right?
757578534902763520 2016-07-25 14:09:32 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons @hayleykrischer sure, but also relatively minor. DWS was bad at her job; she's not the devil.
757577439849619456 2016-07-25 14:05:11 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons in this case I really think this is kind of a nothing burger. I have far deeper reservations about her stance on Palestine!
757577141756321792 2016-07-25 14:04:00 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons honestly that is how I have supported every candidate I've ever voted for for president! With reservations/criticism!
757576979818377216 2016-07-25 14:03:21 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons well one thing I would say is that it is possible to both be critical and support her
757576434202255361 2016-07-25 14:01:11 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons I think she did, didn't she? She finally pressured her out. But maybe you're right and I'm reading this wrong
757576079821250560 2016-07-25 13:59:47 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons @hayleykrischer I understood it as a kind of meaningless honorific/I.e. Polite brush-off but I could be wrong
757571373753573376 2016-07-25 13:41:05 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons but if the fact that she's even bothering with a nicety pisses you off, then that's fair!
757571210410688512 2016-07-25 13:40:26 UTC <rtraister> @rg_simmons I don't think it's actually hiring her. She's a congresswoman, not employed by campaign. This is a nicety, not official role
757414022589386752 2016-07-24 03:15:49 UTC <rtraister> Were it "so simple" even just on the issues, we'd all be recalling the hilarious bitch shirts & cunt memes made for Kerry, Biden & Edwards.
757413340729794562 2016-07-24 03:13:07 UTC <rtraister> And no, hatred for her is not "so simple." Idea that anything re HRC is "so simple" is inane & ahistorical, whatever you think of her.
757412814281666560 2016-07-24 03:11:01 UTC <rtraister> @michelleinbklyn @FreddieDeboer No, I did not. You just read it that way.
757412635411374080 2016-07-24 03:10:18 UTC <rtraister> @FreddieDeboer But FWIW, it's not "strange" that I write about HRC hatred, tho I didn't write the piece @freddiedeboer is complaining about. It's my job.
757412364857794562 2016-07-24 03:09:14 UTC <rtraister> @michelleinbklyn @FreddieDeboer It's not about a piece I wrote.
757410518072225792 2016-07-24 03:01:54 UTC <rtraister> Clue that hatred for HRC may not be "so simple?" Going waaay out of the way to pick a fight about how simple it is. https://twitter.com/freddiedeboer/status/757402855632310272

753621624600100864 2016-07-14 16:06:11 UTC <rtraister> @TomFHannah It was about her professional and intellectual life.
753621405355343872 2016-07-14 16:05:19 UTC <rtraister> @TomFHannah It's about bigger system of how we appreciate women or tell them what's appealing/valuable about them
753621242566078465 2016-07-14 16:04:40 UTC <rtraister> @TomFHannah in a bikini for a piece that is not about swimwear or her body but about her mind and her work.
753621183103467524 2016-07-14 16:04:26 UTC <rtraister> @TomFHannah Point is not about coercion of Portman, it's about why a director would be presented, or might want to be presented...
753619972312731648 2016-07-14 15:59:37 UTC <rtraister> @TomFHannah No. My point is about the history and larger system of how women are evaluated, not about individual choice.
753619724211200001 2016-07-14 15:58:38 UTC <rtraister> @TomFHannah whether the reason for presentation is professional, intellectual, artistic. That was my point.
753619611300556800 2016-07-14 15:58:11 UTC <rtraister> @TomFHannah Why is she partially clothed? Bc women's bodies are presented for physical inspection/appreciation, regardless of...
753619254784778240 2016-07-14 15:56:46 UTC <rtraister> @TomFHannah The story is about religion, work, art, friendship, parenthood. The photos are of the female subject partially clothed
753619133833543680 2016-07-14 15:56:17 UTC <rtraister> @TomFHannah My point was about lack of symmetry between editorial content & images that speaks to how women are presented/valued.
753616846545444865 2016-07-14 15:47:12 UTC <rtraister> @TomFHannah No, neither of those things were my point, but your guess-work is nonetheless appreciated!
753616140476227584 2016-07-14 15:44:24 UTC <rtraister> @TimShutters yep!
753615821658882048 2016-07-14 15:43:08 UTC <rtraister> @LeilaWalsh8 no one is suggesting that this was done against her will
753603795905548288 2016-07-14 14:55:20 UTC <rtraister> @staceyNYCDC so weird I wonder why.
753603451641266176 2016-07-14 14:53:58 UTC <rtraister> Nothing says "we take this woman seriously as a thinker and an artist" like featuring her in a bikini. Just ask the Miss America pageant!

753361785080676354 2016-07-13 22:53:41 UTC <rtraister> Is it weird that price of plane tickets tripled as I was in the midst of buying them?
753315323600834560 2016-07-13 19:49:03 UTC <rtraister> @alexbelkins "Stakes and terms of conflict were different." Agree, though I don't think that makes comparisons invalid. But fair enough!
753310987432984576 2016-07-13 19:31:49 UTC <rtraister> @alexbelkins surely true, tho anxiety re labor, immgrtionn, p-war econ, anarchists, bolshevik rev also established context for violence, no?
753306588937674752 2016-07-13 19:14:21 UTC <rtraister> @alexbelkins fwiw the piece's central comparison isn't the level or scale of violence, rather the political context for it.
753272085582077953 2016-07-13 16:57:14 UTC <rtraister> @ProfessorCrunk Thank you, Brittney. I'm so glad you liked it. And grateful as always for your insight.
753271589651775488 2016-07-13 16:55:16 UTC <rtraister> @ProfJuliaLee Thank you!
753260383532675073 2016-07-13 16:10:44 UTC <rtraister> @fmkaplan Sure, that's true. Though heart of the piece's comparison is larger political context. Not positing symmetry, but echoes.
753255947452243968 2016-07-13 15:53:07 UTC <rtraister> @fmkaplan But if it's about the tossing off of careless superlative or overstatement, I don't think I'm as guilty as your tweet suggested!
753255403857842176 2016-07-13 15:50:57 UTC <rtraister> @fmkaplan If you find the act of drawing the historical comparison overwrought on its own, then fair enough, I get it.
753254625617317888 2016-07-13 15:47:52 UTC <rtraister> @fmkaplan I don't mind personal critique. I just don't like being criticized for an argument I don't make.
753254386583891969 2016-07-13 15:46:55 UTC <rtraister> @fmkaplan Of course I am making a historical comparison; that's the point of the piece. But I don't use overwrought "most...since" language.

747605043168292864 2016-06-27 01:38:26 UTC <rtraister> @stacythal Mine was entirely practical -- Massachusetts, woman from same demographic, Republican governor, loss of Warren in Senate.

744953378854285312 2016-06-20 18:01:40 UTC <rtraister> @sunnyozell @sallykohn Hi, ladies!
744604938316185600 2016-06-19 18:57:06 UTC <rtraister> @Drool4Scandal sorry, I meant granddaughter of Aaron, daughter of Dan.
744601771255955456 2016-06-19 18:44:30 UTC <rtraister> @Drool4Scandal I am, on both counts. How do you know them?
744541719639777280 2016-06-19 14:45:53 UTC <rtraister> @kparinis 7 minute interview in which he asked the questions. Read the book before you imagine what my views are?
744533051187806208 2016-06-19 14:11:26 UTC <rtraister> @kparinis yes I write about this extensively in my book. You should read it if you're curious.
744531453283799040 2016-06-19 14:05:05 UTC <rtraister> @kparinis no, it deals extensively with marriage and singlehood across classes
744216758844801024 2016-06-18 17:14:36 UTC <rtraister> @brendarippee thank you for making me look good!

744192411421728769 2016-06-18 15:37:51 UTC <rtraister> @Stephenson_Sam yes, that is what we're known for.
744192098560204801 2016-06-18 15:36:37 UTC <rtraister> @MarthaPlimpton thank you!

743482138280992768 2016-06-16 16:35:29 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps But neither do I or a lot of the people I know who support HRC or have leveled critiques against him.
743481963563089920 2016-06-16 16:34:47 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps I have to run, not trying to duck out of exchange. More later if you like. If not, maybe in person in coming weeks?
743481639725039621 2016-06-16 16:33:30 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps sorry got tangled & am running out. I meant that I respect many of your HRC critiques, hope for some respect of some BS critique.
743480772905082880 2016-06-16 16:30:04 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps But not every criticism of Sanders is made by an unserious self-interested fake-feminist straw woman.
743480581921587200 2016-06-16 16:29:18 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps I wish the respect were mutual. Not that you have to agree. I know that you don't.
743480031968661504 2016-06-16 16:27:07 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps What we emphasize, what we can overlook, etc. But I don't think your every criticism of HRC is invalid; many are very valid!
743479619467239424 2016-06-16 16:25:29 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps I assume you & I share many deeply held convictions & disagreee about candidates & that disagreement is reflected in our commentary
743479290713505792 2016-06-16 16:24:10 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps I get that people who have roughly the same goals & ideals in mind can differ sharply on how to accomplish/get closer to them.
743478417878884353 2016-06-16 16:20:42 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps Also, I wrote a book that detailed Clinton's (& Clinton supporters') often egregious behavior toward Obama during 2008.
743478331895611392 2016-06-16 16:20:22 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps I'm glad he ran such a successful race & kept HRC to the left (tho I think lots of factors helped there, not just him)
743478162189918208 2016-06-16 16:19:41 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps I've written lots of positive things re Sanders, thought he was a great candidate, closer to me ideologically in some ways.
743477993851490304 2016-06-16 16:19:01 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps Sorry, phone. I've never suggested that everything Sanders does is misogynist. Have written about his strong abortion/Hyde record.
743461147664334849 2016-06-16 15:12:05 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps & I don't think that the fact that HRC/other Dems have rocky relationships w repro rights insulates Sanders from criticism on same.
743460900796043264 2016-06-16 15:11:06 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps The party and HRC have begun to move away from that stance, which I think is a good thing. Kaptur is a remnant of it.
743460619987357697 2016-06-16 15:09:59 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps I have written about Dems' (including HRC)'s past crappy abortion rhetoric & willingness to trade on abortion to build majority.
743460031920746496 2016-06-16 15:07:39 UTC <rtraister> @kthalps FWIW I don't think I've ever written at any length about HRC/abortion without some acknowledgment of her mixed past on the issue.
743274404927397888 2016-06-15 02:50:02 UTC <rtraister> @EricJafMN there are a lot of Democratic nominees he hasn't gone out of his way to endorse.

743268430866972672 2016-06-15 02:26:17 UTC <rtraister> This is perplexing. Kaptur is anti-abortion.https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/742401681451687936

740378941240795137 2016-06-07 03:04:29 UTC <rtraister> @JessicaValenti @rebel19 In retrospective reference to this Matthews exchange or more broadly, going forward?
740374910883799040 2016-06-07 02:48:28 UTC <rtraister> I cannot  believe the enthusiasm I am hearing from Chris Matthews right now. If my 2008 self had heard this, she would've fainted dead away.
740374193179623426 2016-06-07 02:45:37 UTC <rtraister> Also note that Chelsea got the first hug after the speech, before Bill. Emphasizing mothers, daughters, granddaughters.

740003511488917505 2016-06-06 02:12:40 UTC <rtraister> @joanneleon of course they've wanted 2 declare victory: they're running! But her vote also likely to be suppressed if people think it's over
739997914433519617 2016-06-06 01:50:25 UTC <rtraister> @tessalaprofessa but HRC voters might stay home bc they think it's over. Bad in both directions.
739997344247189504 2016-06-06 01:48:10 UTC <rtraister> @brianstelter thanks!
739996561946599424 2016-06-06 01:45:03 UTC <rtraister> @gabrielsnyder but it's bad for him, bad for her, bad for us, regardless of anyone's strategy or future plans.
739996302247858177 2016-06-06 01:44:01 UTC <rtraister> @tessalaprofessa yes but that sucks for everyone. I don't think either candidate benefits disproportionately.
739995351076245504 2016-06-06 01:40:14 UTC <rtraister> Perhaps we can unite in the opinion that calling a historic and hard fought race the night before sucks for literally everyone?

739934657630851072 2016-06-06 21:39:04 UTC <rtraister> @MitchSchindler @SamAdlerBell Then there can be argument or shared acknowledgment that yes, here we are. It doesn't have to shut down convo.
739934465376583684 2016-06-06 21:38:18 UTC <rtraister> @MitchSchindler @SamAdlerBell Fair to say: ok so gender played a role in how we got here, but here we are & I have problems w where we are.
739934296090259457 2016-06-06 21:37:38 UTC <rtraister> @MitchSchindler @SamAdlerBell The anxiety about not being able to respond once sexism is brought up can be paralyzing.
739933751321448448 2016-06-06 21:35:28 UTC <rtraister> @MitchSchindler @SamAdlerBell Right. & examinations of the role of sexism in how she was formed & how she is received aren't always excuses.
739931915155869698 2016-06-06 21:28:10 UTC <rtraister> @MitchSchindler @SamAdlerBell For a bracing (familiar!) example re: coverage of Warren's campaign, see this:https://newrepublic.com/article/105715/boston-common

723171820698914819 2016-04-21 15:29:32 UTC <rtraister> @LindaHirshman1 also, who's to say she won't be part of unionizing effort? She says having the kid has motivated her to get nursing degree.
723171344527945728 2016-04-21 15:27:39 UTC <rtraister> @LindaHirshman1 more women living in different ways has forced Dems to come around on paid leave, sick days, min wage
723171209446195200 2016-04-21 15:27:06 UTC <rtraister> @LindaHirshman1 but I'd argue, and do, that women changing marriage/childbirth patterns is having positive impact on social policy

723163814674362369 2016-04-21 14:57:43 UTC <rtraister> @LindaHirshman1 But Kefelas & Edin have done great research on motivations for kids among women whose other $$ & edu prospects are limited
723163616522821635 2016-04-21 14:56:56 UTC <rtraister> @LindaHirshman1 that leaves so many women without OTHER great professional/educational/economic opportunities...
723163419168247809 2016-04-21 14:56:09 UTC <rtraister> @LindaHirshman1 Certainly not ideas. We need better supports for single parents, & more than that, less of the economic inequality...
723163304143646721 2016-04-21 14:55:42 UTC <rtraister> @LindaHirshman1 Economic prospects aren't better, but other things-motivation, organization, sense of fulfillment-might be, as described.
723161540770168833 2016-04-21 14:48:41 UTC <rtraister> @LindaHirshman1 I don't think it's necessarily self-destructive behavior.

719722219446906881 2016-04-11 03:02:03 UTC <rtraister> @SusanZakin @susanzakin @irin The polls show, not flawed reporting or questions, show older Dem women voting for HRC. Not ALL older women, obviously.

718162735738040321 2016-04-07 19:45:13 UTC <rtraister> @MikeDrewWhat What's sexist is the casting of pursuit of the presidency as negative/destructive. Whatever he intended to indicate.
718162080763940864 2016-04-07 19:42:37 UTC <rtraister> Seriously, defending/doubling down on the actions of your own administration really misses every conceivable point.

718161483746656260 2016-04-07 19:40:15 UTC <rtraister> @MikeDrewWhat not if the meaning of the sentence was to cast her desire to be president as destructive.
718160941733584896 2016-04-07 19:38:05 UTC <rtraister> @nejsnave Yeah, I think he's a huge liability.
718160892656005121 2016-04-07 19:37:54 UTC <rtraister> @MikeDrewWhat I don't think we think the same way about this. If he'd used language that wasn't sexist, it wouldn't have been sexist.

718143825311571968 2016-04-07 18:30:05 UTC <rtraister> @MikeDrewWhat I'm not bothered by vicious back and forth or by incompetent remark. I'm bothered by frame I think is sexist (ambitious).
718132605154168836 2016-04-07 17:45:29 UTC <rtraister> @MikeDrewWhat Yeah, that's part of what I was saying in third graph. But in this case I think both language & larger implication are sexist.
718081974561333248 2016-04-07 14:24:18 UTC <rtraister> @lisabari Based on his real disagreements with her. I'm not saying it's nice, just not as literally dismissive as people are taking it.

718075732858179584 2016-04-07 13:59:30 UTC <rtraister> 1. I don't think unqualified thing was so bad. Provocative language to express policy difference, not an evaluation of her as unqualified.

717323459861356544 2016-04-05 12:10:14 UTC <rtraister> @TheFreedomSuite @neeratanden @TyHealey she's also hailed KG for leadership on issue, so not quite that she opposes F-Act, I don't think.
717182996361650180 2016-04-04 02:52:05 UTC <rtraister> @TyHealey i mention this in my ny paid leave piece. It's about the 250k cap.

716996712221569024 2016-04-04 14:31:52 UTC <rtraister> @TyHealey It's a bit of a fantasy, I think, that she would have run unscathed & adored in 2016. (And I love her and wanted her to run!)
716996599226961920 2016-04-04 14:31:25 UTC <rtraister> @TyHealey People adore EW now, but race she ran in MA was close. She was criticized for being a bad campaigner, elite, wooden, duplicitous.
716995973642366977 2016-04-04 14:28:55 UTC <rtraister> @TyHealey Lots of reasons, incl that she's got 20 yrs of public baggage, has done things people don't like & is running for president.

716992925406773248 2016-04-04 14:16:49 UTC <rtraister> @TyHealey I think lots of feminists are pretty keenly aware of their differences.

715623567296045056 2016-03-31 19:35:28 UTC <rtraister> Yes, this was not what I expected my day to include but I'm pretty happy about it.https://twitter.com/oneilllo/status/715621083790110720

715512507205595136 2016-03-31 12:14:09 UTC <rtraister> @FlyingPeanuts thank you!
715351612206792704 2016-03-30 01:34:49 UTC <rtraister> So Kazoo, a new magazine for girls 5-10, looks like it could be pretty great:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2110119100/kazoo-magazine
715345994263760896 2016-03-30 01:12:30 UTC <rtraister> @Sorenzo4 One thing I'd emphasize is that you are not alone. Many people, single and married, struggle with depression and loneliness.
715342883793059840 2016-03-30 01:00:08 UTC <rtraister> @Sorenzo4 If you are depressed, I hope you'll seek treatment, or perhaps reach out to someone you know for help or conversation.
715342345663815680 2016-03-30 00:58:00 UTC <rtraister> @Sorenzo4 I think the teen pregnancy rate is falling because of increased access to contraception, among other things.
715341971154411520 2016-03-30 00:56:30 UTC <rtraister> @Sorenzo4 The answers differed.
715341915932258304 2016-03-30 00:56:17 UTC <rtraister> @Sorenzo4 It's not my field of expertise, but I did talk to women about whether they're single because they want to be or not.
715281284105445377 2016-03-30 20:55:22 UTC <rtraister> And @irin reminds us: women are already being prosecuted for having abortions:http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/women-are-already-being-prosecuted-having-abortions
715278438169505796 2016-03-30 20:44:03 UTC <rtraister> Cruz's focus on "punishing" providers recalls his endorser's call for their "execution:" http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/11/30/3726326/before-shooting-cruz-touted-endorsement-from-activist-who-called-for-execution-of-abortion-doctors/https://twitter.com/TheLeadCNN/status/715271822661390336
715265492982824960 2016-03-30 19:52:37 UTC <rtraister> Then Kasich told Chuck Todd that he "looked great" & asked if he wanted Taylor Swift tickets. JK that didn't happen.https://twitter.com/msnbc/status/715256495688974336
715262270276808704 2016-03-30 19:39:48 UTC <rtraister> "Some form of punishment" is clearly the name of a future Republican death metal band. You're welcome, Republican death metal fans.
715249901249146880 2016-03-30 18:50:39 UTC <rtraister> Maybe just about how sex works/not joking about rape? Might not've included "don't casually demean & objectify them"https://twitter.com/sullivanamy/status/715248785895636996
715241158327345152 2016-03-30 18:15:55 UTC <rtraister> Yeah, this guy is definitely the reasonable alternative to Trump and Cruz:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kasich-women_us_56fbf160e4b0daf53aee2e3c

714994721521795072 2016-03-29 01:56:40 UTC <rtraister> @doioweyoumoney for lots of kinds of people for whom that model wasn't the right, or the only, fit.
714994665297219584 2016-03-29 01:56:26 UTC <rtraister> @doioweyoumoney I'm glad to hear that. & yes, there are different obstacles, but primacy of early hetero married model was problematic...
714992576617701377 2016-03-29 01:48:08 UTC <rtraister> @noFelld I think he only knows Brooklyn and Manhattan people.

714543268164407296 2016-03-28 20:02:45 UTC <rtraister> @hhavrilesky shit I always forget this part. Also you are so smart.
714502499164676096 2016-03-28 17:20:45 UTC <rtraister> I did a podcast with Sara (@saraeculley) the friend I've written about in book & Times & Salon: http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/uninterrupted-rebecca-traister-sara-culley
714093572698554369 2016-03-27 14:15:49 UTC <rtraister> @JonathanCohn @AviEGreen yeah, there are in fact more WOC, running in several states. Clarified in later tweets.
714064696446423042 2016-03-27 12:21:04 UTC <rtraister> @ANNASFRIENDS thank you! I love Wylie.

713736222359818242 2016-03-26 14:35:50 UTC <rtraister> @ATotalBooker I can't help except to say: if you're a Dem, you have two great choices & can't go wrong. Have fun. Wish I were voting today.

713372660353396736 2016-03-25 14:31:10 UTC <rtraister> This isn't really "mansplaining" + pols doing schtick is painful, but "Just be careful w the face" line is worth it:http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/hillary-clinton-jimmy-kimmel-mansplaining
713371673433649153 2016-03-25 14:27:15 UTC <rtraister> @AditiJuneja3 "Just be careful with the face"
713367229153349632 2016-03-25 14:09:35 UTC <rtraister> @hilsgotilk I'm glad you liked it! Thanks for your generous words.
713361045088243712 2016-03-25 13:45:01 UTC <rtraister> Two of them are black women, which would TRIPLE number to have served in Senate. (Again, that's one, Moseley Braun, elected 24 years ago).
713360777600753664 2016-03-25 13:43:57 UTC <rtraister> Clarification: Several women of color running for Senate (Edwards, Harris, Duckworth, Cortez Masto) & have been 2 WOC in Senate history. 1/2
713359603732451330 2016-03-25 13:39:17 UTC <rtraister> @MsMakkah yes I was, in re Edwards and Harris, but WOC included Hirono currently in Congress.
713359495875993601 2016-03-25 13:38:52 UTC <rtraister> Recalls @jacobinmag piece re "serious barrier to women: access to campaign financing in an economy dominated by men"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/12/hillary-clinton-sexism-bernie-sanders-election/
713358781476900864 2016-03-25 13:36:01 UTC <rtraister> Also in Feb, Wapo reported that Edwards had less than 1/10 of what Van Hollen had in bank? 300,000 v 3.6 million.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/edwards-raises-600000-in-4th-quarter-of-md-senate-primary-race/2016/02/05/e85a39ee-cc27-11e5-ae11-57b6aeab993f_story.html
713356509741256704 2016-03-25 13:27:00 UTC <rtraister> And Tammy Duckworth.https://twitter.com/dwbeard/status/713356278962126848
713352949184008192 2016-03-25 13:12:51 UTC <rtraister> Right! Catherine Cortex Masto in Nevada! Thank you. http://www.latinpost.com/articles/115819/20160219/who-catherine-cortez-masto-everything-need-know-possibly-americas-first.htmhttps://twitter.com/PCalith/status/713351645980200960
713351382372392960 2016-03-25 13:06:37 UTC <rtraister> Also, it matters that they are both running for Senate seats long held by Dem women (Mikulski & Boxer). Senate 20% women.
713350507964792832 2016-03-25 13:03:09 UTC <rtraister> There are two women of color currently running for Senate, Edwards & Kamala Harris. If elected, they'd double # of WOC in Senate, in HISTORY
713349770434232320 2016-03-25 13:00:13 UTC <rtraister> Just for the record, we have only had 2 women of color in the Senate, EVER: Carol Moseley Braun (elected 1992) & Mazie Hirono, serving now.
713348847297290240 2016-03-25 12:56:33 UTC <rtraister> ...this is not a situation in which the playing field started level. We have grave & unjust representational errors to correct.
713348214930477056 2016-03-25 12:54:02 UTC <rtraister> Which is not to say that there aren't reasonable conversations to be had about spending money against other progressive candidates, but...
713348055244865536 2016-03-25 12:53:24 UTC <rtraister> Not mentioned in this piece is that the U.S. has only elected ONE black woman to the Senate, ever, in its history.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/why-emilys-list-is-spending-big-to-defeat-a-progressive-democrat/2016/03/24/47dccf8a-e64a-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html?postshare=111458907355303&tid=ss_tw
713214425335996416 2016-03-24 04:02:24 UTC <rtraister> @tomabernathy thanks, very kind!
713187615986597888 2016-03-24 02:15:52 UTC <rtraister> @McSnewsie @chrislhayes Well, since you mention it, I wrote a column about this a couple of weeks ago: http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/03/could-hillary-clinton-ever-have-imagined-this.html
713179366130368512 2016-03-24 01:43:05 UTC <rtraister> @McSnewsie @chrislhayes I didn't notice! Also I definitely interrupted/talked over Chris tonight, so all's fair. But thanks for looking out.
713178289309945856 2016-03-24 01:38:49 UTC <rtraister> @PurpleFishHead I'm so glad - thank you.

713140991482535940 2016-03-24 23:10:36 UTC <rtraister> Alas, sometimes I feel that it's more like "America, 1776-2016"https://twitter.com/meredithblake/status/713012900504477696
713125662333276161 2016-03-24 22:09:41 UTC <rtraister> On the topic of marriage as not the solution http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/business/for-the-sake-of-the-children-not-marriage-but-help.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0 see also my new book All the Single Ladies: http://www.amazon.com/All-Single-Ladies-Unmarried-Independent/dp/1476716560/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8
713125445353533440 2016-03-24 22:08:50 UTC <rtraister> Also late to GREAT Eduardo Porter piece relevant to my interests: on how marriage not necessarily solution for kids: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/business/for-the-sake-of-the-children-not-marriage-but-help.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0
713124351969796096 2016-03-24 22:04:29 UTC <rtraister> It also reminded me of @AnnaHolmes's prescient 2011 Wapo column on the same topic, also great (& f*ing horrifying): https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/column-anna-holmes-on-donald-trumps-sexism/2011/04/21/AFmSfEHF_story.html
713124047798853632 2016-03-24 22:03:16 UTC <rtraister> Finally read @FranklinFoer's piece today on Trump's history of misogyny. It's great.

712238891353427968 2016-03-22 11:25:59 UTC <rtraister> @ThePlumLineGS I know. I don't think it has to go the way it has historically. Just arguing anxieties on this front are not wholly unfounded
712238170017030144 2016-03-22 11:23:07 UTC <rtraister> I don't think there's zero reason. Historically, white male bluster-including Trump's, business-wise-is coded tough.https://twitter.com/theplumlinegs/status/712235923707142144

711185105952370689 2016-03-19 13:38:37 UTC <rtraister> @Classic_Archaic @scout_lisa it's about fact that there's...a strain of sexism on left which many BS supporters (& campaign!) acknowledge.
711184351795531776 2016-03-19 13:35:37 UTC <rtraister> @Classic_Archaic @scout_lisa I agree, & wrote, that term was annoying & reductionist, but fact that so many people used it is not about me
711183878241787904 2016-03-19 13:33:44 UTC <rtraister> @Classic_Archaic @scout_lisa it is my job to write re women, politics, feminism. There's a strain of sexism on left, my job is to cover it.
711181983771201536 2016-03-19 13:26:12 UTC <rtraister> @Classic_Archaic @scout_lisa I'm not unbiased. I'm an opinion writer. You should read my work if you want to determine my biases.
711020150460456961 2016-03-18 02:43:08 UTC <rtraister> @scout_lisa @Classic_Archaic Huh, so you agree with Morgan that women have a responsibility to support Hillary? Interesting.
711012205630717952 2016-03-18 02:11:34 UTC <rtraister> @JenKirkman Wow, that is fascinating. Have you gotten to the parts about Lowell and labor movement yet?
711012043432845312 2016-03-18 02:10:55 UTC <rtraister> @JenKirkman I'm so glad!
711011721461284865 2016-03-18 02:09:39 UTC <rtraister> @scout_lisa @Classic_Archaic Since you know all there is to know re women & politics, sounds like you don't have to worry about me. Be well!
711009056752857092 2016-03-18 01:59:03 UTC <rtraister> @scout_lisa @Classic_Archaic Thanks for your interest in my work! There's plenty more if you're curious. Have a great weekend.
711008787453353984 2016-03-18 01:57:59 UTC <rtraister> @scout_lisa @Classic_Archaic Here's one about how unmarried women feel about Bernie/Hillary:http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/02/political-power-single-women-c-v-r.html

711008233020923904 2016-03-18 01:55:47 UTC <rtraister> @scout_lisa @Classic_Archaic I'm pretty comfortable owning opinions re women, politics, HRC, Bernie. Check them out: http://www.amazon.com/Big-Girls-Dont-Cry-Everything/dp/143915029X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8

710444336807161856 2016-03-17 12:35:03 UTC <rtraister> @scout_lisa you think she lost youth bc people pointed out sexism? I think Bernie a stronger candidate than that; appealed to young voters.

706956017523773440 2016-03-07 21:33:43 UTC <rtraister> @NKrasnodebska @lisabari @killerfemme I don't think we suffer on it being a personal unique decision!

701717558278414336 2016-02-22 10:37:57 UTC <rtraister> @aurabogado Post emancipation, through progressive era, marriage rates for black women were higher than for white women.

701716474117943296 2016-02-22 10:33:39 UTC <rtraister> @aurabogado Marriage rates for black women differed bc marriage was both prohibited & enforced for enslaved women.
701715740513148928 2016-02-22 10:30:44 UTC <rtraister> @aurabogado A fair point; elision/omission of excerption. I specify mcww in piece bc that's population where marriage rates fell in 19th c

701201047331721216 2016-02-20 00:25:32 UTC <rtraister> But of course now I'm doubting memory of first video. And even in that, obviously unclear who was chanting. Was trusting Huerta's account.

701200765818372096 2016-02-20 00:24:24 UTC <rtraister> FWIW I saw initial video (which I guess was taken down?) in which it sure sounded like "English only." Different from one I've seen since.
701199462979543040 2016-02-20 00:19:14 UTC <rtraister> Hearing from so many that Huerta story has been misreported (by Dolores Huerta, I guess) I should follow up: I do not know who chanted.
701195852640075776 2016-02-20 00:04:53 UTC <rtraister> @MikeDrewWhat I agree it's a good question.
701191571551744000 2016-02-20 23:47:52 UTC <rtraister> Simply cannot wrap my head around Huerta story. Anger at her, while rude, is born of a tense race. But "ENGLISH ONLY?" WTF progressives?

700394173225177089 2016-02-18 18:59:18 UTC <rtraister> @ZacharyLesser Oh, perhaps you were referring to the no-child claim. In which case, the book offers context for that too.
700393848212746240 2016-02-18 18:58:00 UTC <rtraister> @ZacharyLesser @IpsoFractal @lmlauramarsh Book from which line is cited offers more context. Of course, you may still find it false.

700380767420092416 2016-02-18 18:06:02 UTC <rtraister> @jesseberney When he was considering, this seemed like 1 reason it was not an excellent idea. Another reason: fact that he led the hearings.

696885481326452736 2016-02-08 02:37:00 UTC <rtraister> My mentions today, which featured many suggestions that I am a paid shill hack who should suck a vinyl dick, have been a bracing education!
696716285539938304 2016-02-08 15:24:41 UTC <rtraister> 8. Then I am afraid you are serving as exhibit A.
696716220918321152 2016-02-08 15:24:26 UTC <rtraister> 7. But if u really believe you have invalidated the argument that the left has women issues simply by discovering that I made it in 08...
696716100701188096 2016-02-08 15:23:57 UTC <rtraister> 6. It's all about sexism/racism/classism in 2008 (toward HRC, Michelle O, Palin) much of it from the left.
696715902889431041 2016-02-08 15:23:10 UTC <rtraister> 5. These are indeed patterns I write about, alas, over & over again. You can read more about them in my first book: http://www.amazon.com/Big-Girls-Dont-Cry-Everything/dp/143915029X
696715825957441536 2016-02-08 15:22:51 UTC <rtraister> 4. To suggest feminist critique is invalid be it was leveled similarly 8 years ago shows huge lack of comprehension of how sexism works.
696715601792933890 2016-02-08 15:21:58 UTC <rtraister> 3. This argument is in & of itself a pretty telling embodiment of a progressive lack of interest in/respect for feminist commentary.
696715517629984769 2016-02-08 15:21:38 UTC <rtraister> 2. Their inference: the argument that there's misogyny tied up in reactions to HRC must not be true bc I wrote about it last time she ran.
696715401154183168 2016-02-08 15:21:10 UTC <rtraister> 1. So @mtaibbi & @GlennGreenwald tweeted piece I wrote in 08 re sexism from progressives w one I wrote this year re sexism from progressives
696689448352931841 2016-02-08 13:38:03 UTC <rtraister> Yes it's as though sexism on the left were still a thing.https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/696686082524471297
696682264948772864 2016-02-08 13:09:30 UTC <rtraister> It's like a 2008 reunion of the Clinton campaign's Department of Not Helping!
696522526122471424 2016-02-07 02:34:45 UTC <rtraister> It's a very thoughtful piece: http://www.vox.com/2016/2/7/10930018/assessing-political-candidates-clinton-sanders cc @drvox
696522293628047360 2016-02-07 02:33:50 UTC <rtraister> "'Progressive' is an ideological term...'Moderate' is a practical term." I bet @drvox's mentions are a dream today: http://www.vox.com/2016/2/7/10930018/assessing-political-candidates-clinton-sanders
696427157225086977 2016-02-07 20:15:47 UTC <rtraister> @ericas how lovely! There's nothing scheduled so far. Rtraister at gmail
696359239061794816 2016-02-07 15:45:54 UTC <rtraister> @ebruenig oh no oh no that makes me legitimately sad.
696358469205680129 2016-02-07 15:42:51 UTC <rtraister> My previously unconsidered existential nightmare right here: cameras watch as I choose my donuts.https://twitter.com/jmpalmieri/status/696357119977746433
696357623122259970 2016-02-07 15:39:29 UTC <rtraister> Got it. Oh dear.
696357068039680000 2016-02-07 15:37:17 UTC <rtraister> Is there the Rubio disaster in one quick clip?
695800432761896960 2016-02-05 02:45:25 UTC <rtraister> @FuruzanOzbek But the article doesn't suggest it at all. It's about bigger double standards, says nothing about people who support Sanders.
695753735239241730 2016-02-05 23:39:51 UTC <rtraister> !!!! Thanks!https://twitter.com/thebookies4315/status/695749583100510208
695734367742750720 2016-02-05 22:22:54 UTC <rtraister> @DougHenwood @welknett this tweet was about a theoretical Warren candidacy, Doug. Not HRC.
695732592692367360 2016-02-05 22:15:50 UTC <rtraister> @FuruzanOzbek I never suggested every Hillary critic is a sexist.
695708645594628096 2016-02-05 20:40:41 UTC <rtraister> @Onusspears I love Bernie's ideas. I like Bernie very much. Also, my "audience" -- ie young women, also love Bernie.
695708466778894336 2016-02-05 20:39:58 UTC <rtraister> @Onusspears I like him too!
695703113563512832 2016-02-05 20:18:42 UTC <rtraister> @Onusspears Just to clarify new book is NOT AT ALL about Hillary. My first one was; it was certainly not a best seller!
695690423784906752 2016-02-05 19:28:16 UTC <rtraister> @jesseberney fuck.
695689344334561280 2016-02-05 19:23:59 UTC <rtraister> "Another $ driven political mercenary." This is in fact my author bio.https://twitter.com/Onusspears/status/695686232198623232
695665650325417984 2016-02-05 17:49:50 UTC <rtraister> "Are you in my corner today?" Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I'm guessing it's too early for a drink.
695658619770114049 2016-02-05 17:21:54 UTC <rtraister> @thrashRadical I didn't write that.
695655163063889920 2016-02-05 17:08:10 UTC <rtraister> @welknett Right, and well...there's where this whole mess starts.
695654257836609536 2016-02-05 17:04:34 UTC <rtraister> @welknett ...that the bigger picture comes into focus. Not every column filed after Iowa can (or should) include run down of all context
695654095441502208 2016-02-05 17:03:55 UTC <rtraister> @welknett Well, that's nature of my work, in part. Most weeks I write stand alone reactions/columns. It's only in a book or bigger feature..
695653941456084992 2016-02-05 17:03:18 UTC <rtraister> @welknett Then make a run...there just aren't that many women who've run big races like this.
695653867476926464 2016-02-05 17:03:01 UTC <rtraister> @welknett I'm sure someone has tried! But right now  it's probably impossible...to have pre-race approval #s you have to be known quantity
695653017367027712 2016-02-05 16:59:38 UTC <rtraister> @welknett But also appreciate and respect that you didn't like it, respond to it, agree with it. Fair enough!
695652917894897665 2016-02-05 16:59:14 UTC <rtraister> @welknett The article after Iowa? Was about one angle -- women's self-presentation in political debate. Wasn't about whole record.
695652533893783552 2016-02-05 16:57:43 UTC <rtraister> @welknett It is true. I think it's a bigger shift for women, but not a huge sample size.
695652340003704833 2016-02-05 16:56:57 UTC <rtraister> @welknett So putting the candidates and the media reactions to them in historical, gendered context is what I do.
695652063829741569 2016-02-05 16:55:51 UTC <rtraister> @welknett Look, I bet we don't agree on her! I like her more than you. But my job is to write re women & politics from feminist perspective.
695651695863468032 2016-02-05 16:54:23 UTC <rtraister> @welknett Here's a piece about my deeply mixed feelings about her:http://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a30203/hillary-clinton-hot-mess/
695651422994563074 2016-02-05 16:53:18 UTC <rtraister> @welknett This includes some stuff about her shifting positions over the years: https://newrepublic.com/article/122035/meet-new-old-hillary-clinton
695651260851220481 2016-02-05 16:52:39 UTC <rtraister> @welknett Starting here, probably:http://www.salon.com/2006/10/16/hillary_60/
695651159923671040 2016-02-05 16:52:15 UTC <rtraister> @welknett Not this morning. But I've written a book about her, & about a million pieces, many include critiques includng feminist ones
695650741550260224 2016-02-05 16:50:36 UTC <rtraister> @welknett Ha, didn't mean she was universally beloved-never. Just that her approval ratings are far higher when not running than when she is
695650356441776128 2016-02-05 16:49:04 UTC <rtraister> @welknett It's dishonest not to acknowledge long lasting, powerful expectations for how women & men are supposed to comport publicly
695650205597888512 2016-02-05 16:48:28 UTC <rtraister> @welknett But when two candidates debate each other forcefully, and the Times describes it as her being tense & angry & him being calm
695650017667846145 2016-02-05 16:47:43 UTC <rtraister> @welknett I don't chalk it up to misogyny alone. Look, being a woman also helps her in lots of ways.
695649537357172736 2016-02-05 16:45:48 UTC <rtraister> @welknett When women move from standing still--well loved, perhaps, in their roles--to actually running, the reception changes.
695649456235155456 2016-02-05 16:45:29 UTC <rtraister> @welknett Warren hasn't done any of that. Also, HRC is also much beloved, hero-worshipped, when she's not running.
695649269567660032 2016-02-05 16:44:45 UTC <rtraister> @welknett So much of what's unlikeable about HRC is what she's done in service of presidential ambition -- strategizing, contorting.
695649147022610432 2016-02-05 16:44:15 UTC <rtraister> @welknett It also matters that she's NOT running. She has given no sign of wanting to be president. Which makes her very easy to like!
695648968076877824 2016-02-05 16:43:33 UTC <rtraister> @welknett I wish she were running, I really really do. But it's a fantasy to think that she'd escape these kinds of double standards.
695648856701321216 2016-02-05 16:43:06 UTC <rtraister> @welknett As a woman, she'd be getting hit harder than Sanders on foreign policy gaps. Way harder.
695648773993861120 2016-02-05 16:42:46 UTC <rtraister> @welknett And if she were, she'd be getting a lot of the same crap. When she ran for senate, she was tagged as wooden, inauthentic, elite.
695648641109901313 2016-02-05 16:42:15 UTC <rtraister> @welknett I also love Warren and wrote a piece begging her (and others) to challenge Clinton. But but she's not running for president.
695643499908112384 2016-02-05 16:21:49 UTC <rtraister> @STrimel @Upstreamism Also, it's not a refrain whenever she's criticized. It's when she's criticized in a particularly gendered way.
695642853058482176 2016-02-05 16:19:15 UTC <rtraister> @STrimel @Upstreamism Among them, looking at the reception of person running to be first woman president.
695642778768900096 2016-02-05 16:18:57 UTC <rtraister> @STrimel @Upstreamism I think it makes sense to talk about the impact of sexism from a lot of angles.
695640524443815940 2016-02-05 16:10:00 UTC <rtraister> "When we hear that shes not 'likable,' we know what that really means-& what it means for us."http://www.vox.com/2016/2/5/10919754/bernie-bro-sexism
695631349194080260 2016-02-05 15:33:32 UTC <rtraister> My 72 year old mother just saw Star Wars: "Is it true that they didn't make an action figure for Rey, Rebecca? How is that even POSSIBLE?"
695615591818723329 2016-02-05 14:30:55 UTC <rtraister> & only a guy who yells all the time, whose APPEAL is his righteous fury, could be credited w keeping cool as he was yelling, wagging finger.
695615413485498369 2016-02-05 14:30:13 UTC <rtraister> Last point: I don't disagree that HRC got angry & as it was happening I was cringing bc I feared the reception she'd get. But so did Bernie.
695614940481220608 2016-02-05 14:28:20 UTC <rtraister> Kunin: "An angry female voice works against women but is a plus for men" NYT: "Sanders...largely kept his cool in the debate"
695614722146750468 2016-02-05 14:27:28 UTC <rtraister> Times: "The ferocity of Mrs. Clintons remarks...was risky, given that many voters...already have an unfavorable opinion of her."
695614615343009793 2016-02-05 14:27:02 UTC <rtraister> Kunin: If HRC appeared angry "she would be dismissed as an angry, even hysterical, woman; a sight that makes voters squirm."
695614382571704320 2016-02-05 14:26:07 UTC <rtraister> NYT this morning: Clinton "appearing tense and even angry at times, was particularly sensitive"
695614199037300736 2016-02-05 14:25:23 UTC <rtraister> Kunin, who ran against Sanders in 86, writes "Sanders can shout his message & wave his arms for emphasis. Clinton cant."
695613795134267392 2016-02-05 14:23:47 UTC <rtraister> So in short, these two pieces would make an instructive pairing this morning: http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/02/04/when-bernie-sanders-ran-against-vermont/kNP6xUupbQ3Qbg9UUelvVM/story.html?s_campaign=8315 andhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/us/politics/democratic-debate.html?_r=0
695612430722985984 2016-02-05 14:18:21 UTC <rtraister> But if you're already having discussion of structural limitations, you don't have to point finger or yell, which is good, because, y'know...
695612029760098304 2016-02-05 14:16:46 UTC <rtraister> In 08, response to sexism it was often awkward bc it came out of nowhere -- "pile on!" & oh my god they wrote about cleavage.
695611786893123584 2016-02-05 14:15:48 UTC <rtraister> What's interesting about nuanced, historical approach is that it's a calmer way to put stuff like this in context:https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/695584219368656896
695611068689813505 2016-02-05 14:12:57 UTC <rtraister> This is a different conversation, far more nuanced, about history & context of female self-presentation & public reception in male sphere.
695610838418382848 2016-02-05 14:12:02 UTC <rtraister> Which marks a huge -- huge -- different from 08. When the most they expressed was a kind of 1dimensional you-go-girl pugilism.
695610620989874176 2016-02-05 14:11:10 UTC <rtraister> From this, which suggests that Clinton campaign now wants to talk re structural realities of gender in politics:http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/02/04/when-bernie-sanders-ran-against-vermont/kNP6xUupbQ3Qbg9UUelvVM/story.html?s_campaign=8315
695610449438572545 2016-02-05 14:10:29 UTC <rtraister> Women's beliefs re playing w/in system in order to "make it in a mans world" did "not rule out reform, but it did crimp revolution"
695458837894189056 2016-02-04 04:08:02 UTC <rtraister> @LaurenNoJoCo @nikroybal Thanks! I'm so glad!
695458143275507712 2016-02-04 04:05:17 UTC <rtraister> "We have income inequality; we have other forms of inequality..." is pointed.
695457971661377537 2016-02-04 04:04:36 UTC <rtraister> "Bring your heart and your head to vote. We didn't get a chance to talk about racism, sexism, LGBT rights, disability rights..." Strong HRC
695456722333405184 2016-02-04 03:59:38 UTC <rtraister> Here's the thing: how do all the people working multiple jobs have time to stand outside Mitch McConnell's window?
695453263148273664 2016-02-04 03:45:53 UTC <rtraister> Okay, you gotta go beyond calling for Snyder's resignation...
695453098110681089 2016-02-04 03:45:14 UTC <rtraister> Oh you must have missed the whole first hour! It was like immigration, FAMILY Act, Hyde, Helms, yadda yadda...https://twitter.com/josheidelson/status/695452551240482816
695452447217561600 2016-02-04 03:42:38 UTC <rtraister> "I don't believe government should be part of the killing" GOOD ANSWER.
695450970126307328 2016-02-04 03:36:46 UTC <rtraister> Okay, having watched every Democratic debate, can I say that my great hope is that we're going to have a Barbara Jordan revival now?
695450771618267137 2016-02-04 03:35:59 UTC <rtraister> They're both really great.
695449264650997760 2016-02-04 03:30:00 UTC <rtraister> Very, very careful framing: there's nothing you don't know about me [pause] every candidate will face a withering onslaught.
695449078851887104 2016-02-04 03:29:15 UTC <rtraister> "I hope that I'll be able to earn their support" on young people -- this is the right attitude to cop
695448308001538049 2016-02-04 03:26:12 UTC <rtraister> I mean, let me just retweet this AGAIN for emphasis: https://twitter.com/jbouie/status/695448142708285441
695444423262339073 2016-02-04 03:10:45 UTC <rtraister> Agree.  https://twitter.com/jesseberney/status/695444371303337986
695443348413222913 2016-02-04 03:06:29 UTC <rtraister> "Key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be we cannot do it alone." Like, starting now. Can someone else please join me on stage?
695442262575026176 2016-02-04 03:02:10 UTC <rtraister> But can you address the question on Afghanistan?
695441591222140928 2016-02-04 02:59:30 UTC <rtraister> "A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS" is also a strong line.
695438770162675713 2016-02-04 02:48:18 UTC <rtraister> "Wall Street is not one street" is a very powerful (true) line.
695433887271378944 2016-02-04 02:28:53 UTC <rtraister> @cristianafarias Nah, I love that she loves Bernie; FWIW she loves HRC more, or so she says.
695433170653618176 2016-02-04 02:26:03 UTC <rtraister> Hate this tax argument against the single payer plan.
695432022773223425 2016-02-04 02:21:29 UTC <rtraister> She also asked "Where is Martin O'Malley?" When I broke the news, she replied "Oh, that's too bad. He was awfully nice."
695431855718293504 2016-02-04 02:20:49 UTC <rtraister> 5 year old just leaned over, smiled, and whispered in my ear: "Do you feel the Bern?"
695429502084583426 2016-02-04 02:11:28 UTC <rtraister> This is really thoughtful, well done:https://twitter.com/joyannreid/status/695428192442560512
695382851533942784 2016-02-04 23:06:06 UTC <rtraister> @thrashRadical @annfriedman Warren evinces none, makes it much easier to find her appealing. But: you need to want to be pres to be pres.
695382763097055234 2016-02-04 23:05:44 UTC <rtraister> @thrashRadical @annfriedman So much of what's distasteful about HRC is what she's done in service of presidential ambition, right?
695382696105627648 2016-02-04 23:05:28 UTC <rtraister> @thrashRadical @annfriedman Also crucial that she's not strategized around presidential ambition, as HRC (& every other pres) has.
695382531399557120 2016-02-04 23:04:49 UTC <rtraister> @thrashRadical @annfriedman I think she, as a woman, would be hit much harder than Bernie has on lack of FP experience.
695382456665374720 2016-02-04 23:04:31 UTC <rtraister> @thrashRadical @annfriedman When she ran in MA she was attacked as wooden, inauthentic, bad at campaigning.
695382372406038528 2016-02-04 23:04:11 UTC <rtraister> @thrashRadical @annfriedman The short version is, I think we fool ourselves to think she wouldn't be subject to related criticism.
695382263375114242 2016-02-04 23:03:45 UTC <rtraister> @thrashRadical @annfriedman I wrote a lot about Warren question yesterday -- you can see my TL since I'm headed out.
695382168202145792 2016-02-04 23:03:23 UTC <rtraister> @thrashRadical @annfriedman These names (save Warren) illustrate my point. They are radical! They are great! They are not presidents.
695381587555254272 2016-02-04 23:01:04 UTC <rtraister> @thrashRadical @annfriedman This reminds me of a line I wrote in 08: "Wake me when Barbara Ehrenreich can win Ohio"
695370165236555776 2016-02-04 22:15:41 UTC <rtraister> @ActuallyImGood @FisherBurton I think he meant to block me instead. Sorry.
695370095334289413 2016-02-04 22:15:24 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton But I articulated the pattern: I wrote re difficulty women have presenting as loud radicals; that sentiment was in this piece.
695369392117276674 2016-02-04 22:12:37 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton @ActuallyImGood Sorry to have provoked such frustration. I wish you well.
695368630599442432 2016-02-04 22:09:35 UTC <rtraister> @ActuallyImGood @FisherBurton My opinion is that HRC's support for Cuomo is a very valid thing to critique her for & I liked Kate's piece.
695368028477747200 2016-02-04 22:07:11 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton In fact, I'm pretty sure that that's the very point Steinem makes in her endorsement of him against the Republican woman.
695367918217859072 2016-02-04 22:06:45 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton No one in the context of article or our exchange has suggested that a man can't be a better feminist than a woman.
695366727438356480 2016-02-04 22:02:01 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton But FWIW I do question your tweets, since neither Dem women in question is comparable to Palin, who you cited earlier.
695366184372346880 2016-02-04 21:59:52 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton It seems to me that you're the one making further inferences re Bernie's claims about being a better feminist etc..
695366034459471872 2016-02-04 21:59:16 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton This was someone else's article. I noted a pattern and explained I was referring to the overlap with my piece.
695363855296233472 2016-02-04 21:50:36 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton Why are you worried about what I think of Bernie's locutions? I tweeted a story and explained the pattern I referred to.
695361227518705666 2016-02-04 21:40:10 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton I didn't say he did anything wrong. Pattern is what I wrote about earlier this week, about limits on female public expression.
695353295695577088 2016-02-04 21:08:39 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton I didn't say anything about transgressions. I said there were patterns. I'm sorry you feel so defensive.
695307027023806466 2016-02-04 18:04:48 UTC <rtraister> @TyHealey Have you been?
695303480169340930 2016-02-04 17:50:42 UTC <rtraister> If you care about gendered patterns in American politics, read this about Bernie & the woman he ran against in 1986:http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2016/01/bernie-sanders-madeleine-kunin-feminism
695268883180212224 2016-02-04 15:33:13 UTC <rtraister> FIN. (These tweets have been numbered in tribute to @HeerJeet) No doubt they will earn me many friends today.
695268711297597440 2016-02-04 15:32:32 UTC <rtraister> 6. And not a flattering reflection of progressive investments or interests.
695268478035582976 2016-02-04 15:31:37 UTC <rtraister> 5. Then you either did not think of women, OR you are giving them the finger. Which is, you know, shitty.
695268385823789057 2016-02-04 15:31:15 UTC <rtraister> 4. BUT if you're going to frame your endorsement around those who've been barred historically from presidency & you don't mention women...
695268190029533184 2016-02-04 15:30:28 UTC <rtraister> 3. But really, go ahead & critique her, as Moore does, because he prefers her opponent! As do many others, for many excellent reasons.
695268130281668608 2016-02-04 15:30:14 UTC <rtraister> 2 1/2. (Even if it would be sort of polite to acknowledge)
695267992553308161 2016-02-04 15:29:41 UTC <rtraister> 2. Also, in an endorsement of Bernie, there'd ordinarily be no need to say anything positive about HRC or historic nature of her campaign.
695267593662435328 2016-02-04 15:28:06 UTC <rtraister> 1. So key point in smart @mtomasky today: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/04/michael-moore-s-casual-chauvinism.html No issue with Moore endorsing Bernie. Endorse Bernie! Makes good sense!
695263667999358976 2016-02-04 15:12:30 UTC <rtraister> @Broward54 I disagree that it is unfair to Joe.
695259044425129985 2016-02-04 14:54:08 UTC <rtraister> Yes, remember folks: no woman's been president & women are 20% of congress cause they just haven't merited it enoughhttps://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/695253304452886529
695095402920550401 2016-02-03 04:03:52 UTC <rtraister> @hillarykwiatek as soon as she headed off the stage.
695094981455912961 2016-02-03 04:02:12 UTC <rtraister> Hurry up, Hillary. Pretty sure everyone with a reporter's notebook is going to be wanting to meet the rabbi in the next 24 hours.
695094642858131456 2016-02-03 04:00:51 UTC <rtraister> "I wanna meet the rabbi!"
695094504655884289 2016-02-03 04:00:18 UTC <rtraister> I can't believe a) I still have a fever b) I'm still awake c) there's another debate tomorrow.
695093325204971520 2016-02-03 03:55:37 UTC <rtraister> "I want them to hold me accountable...how's this gonna happen?" I see what you did there.
695092619790147584 2016-02-03 03:52:49 UTC <rtraister> She just danced to feelin' the Bern, didn't she.
695091544722898948 2016-02-03 03:48:33 UTC <rtraister> @jonathanchait I mean, always.
695090841287815168 2016-02-03 03:45:45 UTC <rtraister> I was busy RTing rabbi jokes; a friend urged me to go back & listen to ego/humility response & yeah, may be the best I've ever heard her.
695086971417423872 2016-02-03 03:30:22 UTC <rtraister> @MikeMadden ALL OF THEM THIS WEEK.
695086773609828353 2016-02-03 03:29:35 UTC <rtraister> @MikeMadden Was late for Bernie. Silly me, didn't realize that we were going from no debates to debates every goddamn night.
695085950905532416 2016-02-03 03:26:19 UTC <rtraister> @MikeMadden In fairness, makes up for the usual: "People seem to hate you more than Satan. Tell us why they should hate you less."
695085673850748928 2016-02-03 03:25:13 UTC <rtraister> "Criticism...Think about it seriously. There are lessons to be learned, often from people who don't agree with you." Tell me more, Oprah.
695085059649466368 2016-02-03 03:22:46 UTC <rtraister> "How are you doing to defend yourself against right wing attacks" is kind of a gimme, Shawn.
695080809204727809 2016-02-03 03:05:53 UTC <rtraister> "They don't have to be for me, I will be for them." She's gotten v good at not being defensive re all the "So...people hate you; respond" qs
695019158514311168 2016-02-03 23:00:54 UTC <rtraister> I mean, it's been five years now I've been talking about how my book is almost done. I guess now it's true. Also: terrifying.
695018865898754048 2016-02-03 22:59:45 UTC <rtraister> Stop your lying.pic.twitter.com/azWxdDAMii
695009011607957505 2016-02-03 22:20:35 UTC <rtraister> @DougHenwood Of course! What else would motivate me besides unthinking & venal self-regard? & yes: the rain reveals its bias against us all.
695007714842394624 2016-02-03 22:15:26 UTC <rtraister> @DougHenwood It's just my corporatist identitarian impulse to protect my own bourgeois self-interest talking.
695003872335679489 2016-02-03 22:00:10 UTC <rtraister> @DougHenwood Cut the mansplaining, bro.
695003010200682497 2016-02-03 21:56:44 UTC <rtraister> Been out all day. Glad to find things very civilized and not at all intense or ill-tempered on primary internet today. #GoodTimes
694938441662996481 2016-02-03 17:40:10 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell @robyn_shapiro but this is changing - her candidacy and how we receive it us part of shifting the paradigms.
694938310918144000 2016-02-03 17:39:39 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell @robyn_shapiro more that women radicals would never have gotten to plausible candidacy, especially not "first" woman
694938177124044800 2016-02-03 17:39:07 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell @robyn_shapiro but mostly, no, I'm@not suggesting she's a natural radical who's kept her light under a bushel.
694938033649537034 2016-02-03 17:38:33 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell @robyn_shapiro though there are surprising moments - Hyde! Pretty radical.
694937901403148288 2016-02-03 17:38:01 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell @robyn_shapiro that urge was likely stamped out early.
694937834973691904 2016-02-03 17:37:45 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell @robyn_shapiro though also, yes, to whatever degree she might have been inclined to be more radical, in style or substance
694937694724612096 2016-02-03 17:37:12 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell @robyn_shapiro I'm saying in part that the phenomenon selects for a candidate like HRC.
694937480039129088 2016-02-03 17:36:21 UTC <rtraister> @SamAdlerBell @robyn_shapiro so much to reply to all this but bad work schedule - soon!
694915652327493632 2016-02-03 16:09:37 UTC <rtraister> @NDiSabat But people react to what they fear you're saying.
694915614926888964 2016-02-03 16:09:28 UTC <rtraister> @NDiSabat Right, that's how it goes. Many non-sexist reasons to support Bernie! This doesn't suggest otherwise.
694902717173665792 2016-02-03 15:18:13 UTC <rtraister> @NewsConnoisseur This document? No. Am I familiar with Clinton's record? Yes! I wrote a book about her in 2010.
694902301933375488 2016-02-03 15:16:34 UTC <rtraister> @NDiSabat @NYMag @HillaryClinton Thank you! though sorry about the epic nature of the argument!
694901946076041220 2016-02-03 15:15:09 UTC <rtraister> @jebediahreed Oh god, yes, sounding more like Thatcher should do the trick!
694897604824600576 2016-02-03 14:57:54 UTC <rtraister> Oh, this is worth watching. "Oddly enough" HRC's problem is that she shouts. [nods]https://twitter.com/desmoinesdem/status/694891192970969088
694645315568300032 2016-02-02 22:15:23 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly You and I are clearly talking past each other right now. I wish you all the best.
694641584558718977 2016-02-02 22:00:34 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly Sorry, where did I say we should celebrate her?
694641180387217408 2016-02-02 21:58:57 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly Or to make clear that repro access is an economic issue that disproportionately impacts poor women and women of color?
694640988199985154 2016-02-02 21:58:12 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly also is there no feminist engagement with the fact that HRC is first mainstream candidate to emphasize objections to Hyde?
694640648465575936 2016-02-02 21:56:51 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly right so your stance is that there should be no feminist engagement with the first woman to get close to the presidency?
694639119088119808 2016-02-02 21:50:46 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly I have never suggest that you should feel otherwise.
694638765722198018 2016-02-02 21:49:22 UTC <rtraister> @Crayz9000 @anatinsly No problem! Everyone's welcome.
694638520137355265 2016-02-02 21:48:23 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly Because it might get picked up by people who use it too bluntly in political fights?
694638428701462528 2016-02-02 21:48:01 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly So then there should be no feminist consideration of the first woman to come close to the presidency in American history?
694638282345431040 2016-02-02 21:47:26 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly There is nothing in the piece I wrote today about HRC critics being sexist trolls.
694637920897126401 2016-02-02 21:46:00 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly and disinterest in policies that disproportionately impact them. There are perspectives. Yours is one, and a compelling one.
694637780622839810 2016-02-02 21:45:27 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly I don't mind harsh. What I mind is implication that any defense of Clinton is rooted in disregard for poor women & woc.
694636070428872704 2016-02-02 21:38:39 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @Crayz9000 And I don't think that's true at all.
694635941751869442 2016-02-02 21:38:08 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @Crayz9000 Legitimate! But yr argument is that defense of HRC, or attempts to situate her in a feminist context, is illegitimate.
694634269730283520 2016-02-02 21:31:30 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @Crayz9000 against defense of the candidate who's been out in front on Hyde & Flint, for example.
694634170329501698 2016-02-02 21:31:06 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @Crayz9000 And FWIW I don't think that a focus on issues that disproportionately impact women of color automatically mitigates
694634062951096320 2016-02-02 21:30:40 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @Crayz9000 I understand your argument, Ana. But I also think that not every story is about every issues.
694632987774836738 2016-02-02 21:26:24 UTC <rtraister> @FisherBurton I agree! this is all changing around us, in part because of and in reaction to HRC.
694632851279585280 2016-02-02 21:25:52 UTC <rtraister> @nickconfessore So some get to play  louder & looser, individually, bc they don't stand in for threat of increased female power thru policy.
694632459489644545 2016-02-02 21:24:18 UTC <rtraister> @nickconfessore Yes, tho dynamics on right so different for women. Bc policies they run on support rather than disrupt power structure.
694631846370476032 2016-02-02 21:21:52 UTC <rtraister> So to some degree, the expectations/paradigm I describe selected for a pragmatist like HRC. @nickconfessore
694631512608788481 2016-02-02 21:20:32 UTC <rtraister> Rather that a loud revolutionary was never going to be the first viable female candidate for president.https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/694627811877871616
694631346271055873 2016-02-02 21:19:53 UTC <rtraister> Not an alternate theory--a complementary observation. My point was not that HRC is a crypto-revolutionary...https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/694627811877871616
694616276564590594 2016-02-02 20:20:00 UTC <rtraister> @DaveyStrategies Hi Lynn! Thank you!
694613386236133376 2016-02-02 20:08:31 UTC <rtraister> @Chris_arnade Easy to read a consideration of gender/sexism and presume it to be a full excuse. But I don't present it as one I don't think.
694613171085139970 2016-02-02 20:07:39 UTC <rtraister> @Chris_arnade But nothing in this piece suggested that the critique therein invalidated other critiques.
694612968391217152 2016-02-02 20:06:51 UTC <rtraister> @Chris_arnade There're illions of pieces out there about what she's doing wrong or right politically, strategically, the reaction of voters
694612821292773376 2016-02-02 20:06:16 UTC <rtraister> @Chris_arnade But the piece wasn't about "Why is she failing" it was about "here is a thing she did differently last night"
694612670906028032 2016-02-02 20:05:40 UTC <rtraister> @Chris_arnade Not necessarily to account for her whole history, or full breadth of complaint against her, & certainly not in every piece.
694612537342562304 2016-02-02 20:05:08 UTC <rtraister> @Chris_arnade But my job is a fairly specific one: it's to put her story in gendered and historical context, which is what I was doing here.
694612444921069568 2016-02-02 20:04:46 UTC <rtraister> @Chris_arnade So I understand that framing might not satisfy yr critiques which are real & not invalidated by gendered consideration
694612219733098496 2016-02-02 20:03:53 UTC <rtraister> @Chris_arnade But also, my JOB is to consider her role in a gendered context.
694611947749273602 2016-02-02 20:02:48 UTC <rtraister> @Chris_arnade And my piece today was not a comprehensive rundown. It was a post-Iowa reaction piece re one aspect of her self presentation.
694611823287496705 2016-02-02 20:02:18 UTC <rtraister> @Chris_arnade Well, I don't think that style is the only way to look at Clintons. I write a ton about HRC. Have written a book about her.
694594318791741440 2016-02-02 18:52:45 UTC <rtraister> @zrok_ No, she's never been inevitable. And she does have massive establishment support. But that's evidence of how UN-inevitable she is.
694588714085933057 2016-02-02 18:30:28 UTC <rtraister> @KnowWorkNoMoney Yes, but none of them were viable presidential candidates, which is what this piece was about.
694588545407782912 2016-02-02 18:29:48 UTC <rtraister> @zrok_ And I think it's crazy to write about her as if she's a shoo-in. She's got tons of advantages and many disadvantages. They both do!
694588429686939649 2016-02-02 18:29:21 UTC <rtraister> @zrok_ Oh gosh, I also don't think I painted her as an underdog. I've just never believed she was inevitable.
694588189781131264 2016-02-02 18:28:23 UTC <rtraister> @scottros thanks, Scott!
694586200515047424 2016-02-02 18:20:29 UTC <rtraister> @zrok_ I don't think I was arguing that it matters more. I think I was just arguing that it matters.
694584452090036226 2016-02-02 18:13:32 UTC <rtraister> @zrok_ Your case, that my piece was not persuasive to you, is also strong! I accept your criticism and am grateful for the conversation.
694584353087737856 2016-02-02 18:13:09 UTC <rtraister> @zrok_ I feel like that case is pretty strong.
694584310427435008 2016-02-02 18:12:59 UTC <rtraister> @zrok_ What evidence? That we've never had a viable female pres candidate who was a revolutionary in 200+ years & we don't have one now.
694583487660212226 2016-02-02 18:09:42 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly I understand & respect critiques of HRC's record. This was a piece re her self-presentation. It doesn't invalidate other critique
694583031999434752 2016-02-02 18:07:54 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly You pointed out the words you object to. To me, they're acknowledgment of double standard and gender bias, not victimhood.
694582653304115205 2016-02-02 18:06:23 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly But I didn't write "rather than." Of course they stem from real issues, didn't suggest otherwise. They ALSO are shaped by gender.
694582313099890688 2016-02-02 18:05:02 UTC <rtraister> @zrok_ and be a viable candidate (see above sentence) for president in 2016? Yep. Can never be "a leftist?" No, didn't say that.
694581774698024960 2016-02-02 18:02:54 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @JessicaValenti Or should we just not describe or acknowledge them?
694581649913335808 2016-02-02 18:02:24 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @JessicaValenti Is every acknowledgement of (real) double standards a claim of victimhood? Are gendered stereotypes not real?
694581222442418176 2016-02-02 18:00:42 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 @lovehealmymind makes her more appealing. It would be different if she were actually running, exhibiting that desire.
694581120227282947 2016-02-02 18:00:18 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 @lovehealmymind stems from her strategizing around her ambition for the presidency. That Warren seems to lack that
694581003860467716 2016-02-02 17:59:50 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 @lovehealmymind Also, it matters that Warren seem not to WANT to be pres, and HRC does. Some of what we criticize most in HRC
694580865276493824 2016-02-02 17:59:17 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 @lovehealmymind Also as a woman I think Warren would have gotten hit harder on lack of foreign policy experience than Bernie has
694580769898008577 2016-02-02 17:58:54 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 @lovehealmymind Same with HRC who's been a cool hero to some when she's NOT running, but as soon as she competes, things change
694580631536340993 2016-02-02 17:58:21 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 @lovehealmymind inauthentic, elite, a bad campaigner. Her electrifying speeches went viral before & after campaign, not during.
694580416360112128 2016-02-02 17:57:30 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 @lovehealmymind But I believe she would have faced related obstacles. When she ran in Massachusetts, she was tagged as wooden
694580305680842752 2016-02-02 17:57:04 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 I've been addressing Eliz Warren point in my replies. I agree I wish Warren had run: https://newrepublic.com/article/118389/hillary-clinton-needs-female-primary-opponent-2016 @lovehealmymind
694579722982940672 2016-02-02 17:54:45 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 @csittenfeld All fair critiques. Not suggesting they're invalid. Just trying to offer gender context for public presentation
694579258061119488 2016-02-02 17:52:54 UTC <rtraister> @parallelcircle this is what my argument was. Not that she's hiding her revolutionary light under a bushel.
694578955546918912 2016-02-02 17:51:42 UTC <rtraister> @parallelcircle Though I do think there are some pretty revolutionary things she IS saying, right now (re: Hyde--a big deal)
694578861586190341 2016-02-02 17:51:19 UTC <rtraister> @parallelcircle I didn't mean to suggest that she's a crypto-revolutionary.
694578641443885056 2016-02-02 17:50:27 UTC <rtraister> @zrok_ Nope. Didn't say that anywhere here.
694578508098592770 2016-02-02 17:49:55 UTC <rtraister> @melsil rtraister gmail
694578441585332224 2016-02-02 17:49:39 UTC <rtraister> @JustLikeACoward @roqchams @JessicaValenti Not an excuse for who she is Consideration of how gender plays into career of an anomalous figure
694578175393861632 2016-02-02 17:48:36 UTC <rtraister> @JustLikeACoward @roqchams @JessicaValenti Nope. It's an examination of dynamics that led her to become who she is, which I do a lot.
694577689093627904 2016-02-02 17:46:40 UTC <rtraister> @osselot @JessicaValenti Not at all! Nothing here suggests that critiques of her are invalid.
694577292400525312 2016-02-02 17:45:05 UTC <rtraister> @parallelcircle @roqchams @JessicaValenti It's just an examination of gender dynamics in political self-presentation.
694577163853533184 2016-02-02 17:44:35 UTC <rtraister> @parallelcircle @roqchams @JessicaValenti Nope. It's not an accusation that anyone's sexist for not supporting anyone, actually.
694576973864108032 2016-02-02 17:43:49 UTC <rtraister> @sfer222 well I would hope that she would! But she did get dinged hard for being a Harvard elite professor, etc..
694576792124964864 2016-02-02 17:43:06 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 @csittenfeld It doesn't excuse her choices, or fully explain them, but you can't understand her w/o taking gender into account
694576575539494912 2016-02-02 17:42:14 UTC <rtraister> @curtmark59 @csittenfeld She's the only woman ever to get this close to being president; her gender is tied up in who she is.
694576194151436288 2016-02-02 17:40:43 UTC <rtraister> @kevinkresse indeed, part of my point is that she is NOT a revolutionary.
694575971123531776 2016-02-02 17:39:50 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @JessicaValenti Clearly you disagree strongly w my assessment & I respect that! But disagreement doesn't invalidate the project.
694575614049832963 2016-02-02 17:38:25 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @JessicaValenti which is a) my job and b) a fair and reasonable project in a country that's never elected a woman.
694575299422507008 2016-02-02 17:37:10 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @JessicaValenti I don't think I'm painting anyone as "victim." I'm offering gendered context of woman running for president
694574799323009025 2016-02-02 17:35:11 UTC <rtraister> @azeegs @kadarlikeradar All of this is so true.
694574163697254401 2016-02-02 17:32:39 UTC <rtraister> @lovehealmymind But short answer is: I wish she'd run, but I don't actually think she'd wholly escape related traps.
694574044327329792 2016-02-02 17:32:11 UTC <rtraister> @lovehealmymind If you look at my recent replies you'll see my thoughts on this ad nauseum!
694573779817762816 2016-02-02 17:31:08 UTC <rtraister> @sfer222 Alas it seems we won't know...
694573714545983490 2016-02-02 17:30:52 UTC <rtraister> @sfer222 @emilynussbaum So while I'd love to have seen her run, I don't think assumption that she would have been treated better is right.
694573524577550338 2016-02-02 17:30:07 UTC <rtraister> @sfer222 @emilynussbaum She hasn't strategized and contorted in way HRC has, in part because HRC HAS wanted to be president.
694573413311123456 2016-02-02 17:29:40 UTC <rtraister> @sfer222 @emilynussbaum & I think the fact that she doesn't seem to WANT to be president makes her much more appealing than HRC to many.
694573250781773824 2016-02-02 17:29:02 UTC <rtraister> @sfer222 @emilynussbaum Also I think that as a woman she would have been hit much harder by now on lack of foreign policy experience.
694573153469779969 2016-02-02 17:28:38 UTC <rtraister> @sfer222 @emilynussbaum she was tagged as inauthentic, wooden, elite, a bad campaigner, lots of same charges leveled at HRC.
694573071303364610 2016-02-02 17:28:19 UTC <rtraister> @sfer222 @emilynussbaum But I also think that if she had, she would have faced related gender challenges. Recall that when she RAN in MA
694572949764980736 2016-02-02 17:27:50 UTC <rtraister> @sfer222 @emilynussbaum I've been responding to others who've argued this. I wish that EW had challenged HRC:https://newrepublic.com/article/118389/hillary-clinton-needs-female-primary-opponent-2016
694572725017432064 2016-02-02 17:26:56 UTC <rtraister> @YeaYouRite As creative as when I publicly pleaded for her (& other women) to challenge Hillary in the primary? https://newrepublic.com/article/118389/hillary-clinton-needs-female-primary-opponent-2016
694572227749089281 2016-02-02 17:24:58 UTC <rtraister> @ButtPatterson @JessicaValenti They are not viable presidential candidates (would that they were!) This is exactly my point.
694571371880382464 2016-02-02 17:21:34 UTC <rtraister> @BajaAZ4Bernie @grgdwyr @Wind2Energy @JessicaValenti And I wish Elizabeth Warren were running for president. She's not though.
694571169836601349 2016-02-02 17:20:46 UTC <rtraister> @JARRODMYRICK @Wind2Energy @jarrodmyrick @ZephyrTeachout @JessicaValenti Glad to hear it!
694571049371959296 2016-02-02 17:20:17 UTC <rtraister> @NewsConnoisseur @JessicaValenti She's also not running for president.
694570939195990016 2016-02-02 17:19:51 UTC <rtraister> @JustLikeACoward @roqchams @JessicaValenti That's why I'm not arguing that it makes her politics any better, just that it might be true.
694569529217826816 2016-02-02 17:14:14 UTC <rtraister> @anatinsly @JessicaValenti Sort of exactly my point!
694569384476540929 2016-02-02 17:13:40 UTC <rtraister> @kadarlikeradar @azeegs But I also think that she would have bumped up into many obstacles related to the ones Hillary has faced.
694569264515260418 2016-02-02 17:13:11 UTC <rtraister> @kadarlikeradar @azeegs Believe me, I also wish that EW had challenged Clinton. I've said so loudly here:https://newrepublic.com/article/118389/hillary-clinton-needs-female-primary-opponent-2016
694569202674462720 2016-02-02 17:12:57 UTC <rtraister> @kadarlikeradar @azeegs Which means she hasn't contorted and strategized the way HRC, who DOES want to be president, has.
694569142414876673 2016-02-02 17:12:42 UTC <rtraister> @kadarlikeradar @azeegs Also, I think one of the reasons EW is so appealing to so many is because she doesn't seem to WANT to be president
694569070822346753 2016-02-02 17:12:25 UTC <rtraister> @kadarlikeradar @azeegs It's easier to cheer women, including both HRC and EW, when they are in jobs, not competing in elections
694568954052894720 2016-02-02 17:11:57 UTC <rtraister> @kadarlikeradar @azeegs she was criticized, like Hillary, for being wooden, inauthentic, remote, elite and a bad campaigner.
694568867503411201 2016-02-02 17:11:37 UTC <rtraister> @kadarlikeradar @azeegs I also think that even though we think of loving her for fiery speeches, when she was actually CAMPAIGNING
694568794694492160 2016-02-02 17:11:19 UTC <rtraister> @kadarlikeradar @azeegs I think she as a woman would get hit a lot harder on lack of foreign policy experience.
694568727363371008 2016-02-02 17:11:03 UTC <rtraister> @kadarlikeradar @azeegs I've been replying to others raising the same point, which is fair, but disagree that you can sub in EW for Bernie
694568126919397376 2016-02-02 17:08:40 UTC <rtraister> @biettetimmons earnest, rude, angry, you know...my replies are a veritable rainbow of grumpiness!
694567910065463297 2016-02-02 17:07:48 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia So those are my thoughts. Twitterfied.
694567876297097220 2016-02-02 17:07:40 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia That doesn't excuse the contortions, just saying that Warren's LACK of presidential drive helps keep her more appealing.
694567790091636737 2016-02-02 17:07:20 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia So much of what people dislike in HRC is product of her strategizing how to get into this unlikely role: plausible woman pres.
694567657929084930 2016-02-02 17:06:48 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia That makes sense! & means she hasn't had to contort or fundraise or strategize in ways that HRC, who DOES want to be pres, has.
694567522528526337 2016-02-02 17:06:16 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia Also, I think it makes a real difference that part of why we (reasonably!) love Warren is bc she seems not to WANT to be pres.
694567442476068864 2016-02-02 17:05:57 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia Also, I think she, as a woman, would have been hit harder already on foreign policy experience than Bernie has been.
694567358401220608 2016-02-02 17:05:37 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia But when she's running she's unlikeable, wooden, a bad campaigner. Warren was tagged as same during her campaign.
694567277354680321 2016-02-02 17:05:18 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia Women's rights are human rights, texts from Hillary badass when at State, regularly voted most admire woman in US
694567157712183296 2016-02-02 17:04:49 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia Easier to find women inspiring when they're not in threatening, competitive races against men. HRC too:
694566968628764672 2016-02-02 17:04:04 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia We think of how we love her fiery speeches, and we do! But they were largely before and after her actual CAMPAIGN.
694566852664623104 2016-02-02 17:03:36 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia But I'm not sure that her road would have been like Bernie's; I think she would have faced gender related challenges he hasn't.
694566645147291648 2016-02-02 17:02:47 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia Sorry for delay. So. I was very open about my wish that Warren run:https://newrepublic.com/article/118389/hillary-clinton-needs-female-primary-opponent-2016
694566071165128704 2016-02-02 17:00:30 UTC <rtraister> @theqeld @JessicaValenti All popular enough to make viable runs for the presidency!
694565602065780736 2016-02-02 16:58:38 UTC <rtraister> @jsende You know, I enjoy setting little goals for myself. Also, I like to talk to people. Even people who are very grumpy.
694565325652779008 2016-02-02 16:57:32 UTC <rtraister> @pblest Well as I said, I was all for it! https://newrepublic.com/article/118389/hillary-clinton-needs-female-primary-opponent-2016
694556805511409666 2016-02-02 16:23:41 UTC <rtraister> @EricMGarcia on phone right now, but I've been addressing this this morning in my replies...more soon.
694555951190405122 2016-02-02 16:20:17 UTC <rtraister> @pblest tactic that is harder for women to deploy on a political stage. I'm not aiming to tell a complete story of their pros/cons.
694555811717193728 2016-02-02 16:19:44 UTC <rtraister> @pblest My piece isn't questioning Sanders' very real appeals! Insofar as it's about him, it's about his ability to deploy a rhetorical
694554559205740544 2016-02-02 16:14:45 UTC <rtraister> @SnowballWhale @TNCTerlizzi @JessicaValenti sorry, no. But a writer is always happy to provoke such passionate response! Have a great day.
694554154681892865 2016-02-02 16:13:09 UTC <rtraister> @dburns7499 Part of argument is that it's been so hard for women to be loved as passionately angry/revolutionaries that few have tried.
694553957683826688 2016-02-02 16:12:22 UTC <rtraister> The mornings you vow to respond to all of your overtired, deeply impassioned Twitter-replies are the best mornings.
694553098698760192 2016-02-02 16:08:57 UTC <rtraister> @HeerJeet @pblest She would get hit MUCH harder for it, I'm sure.
694552801620463616 2016-02-02 16:07:46 UTC <rtraister> @dburns7499 @JessicaValenti well, that's part of my point, I think...
694552677016059905 2016-02-02 16:07:17 UTC <rtraister> @aaronpmarks @JamilSmith Well, in part because she's not doing well. I wrote plenty about Palin in 08.
694552562268270592 2016-02-02 16:06:49 UTC <rtraister> @DougHenwood @saraeckel Other people willfully mischaracterizing a piece re HRC/Bernie?! Strong argument for your own mischaracterization.
694551990781743104 2016-02-02 16:04:33 UTC <rtraister> @pblest but also what makes her the candidate, right? Anyway. I don't think we know answer, but I don't think it's a simple counteractual.
694551890114248704 2016-02-02 16:04:09 UTC <rtraister> @pblest HRC's ambition to be president, &strategizing toward it, is part of what makes her so UNappealing...
694551659612078081 2016-02-02 16:03:14 UTC <rtraister> @pblest Plus there's fact that 1 of reasons she's not running seems to be that she doesn't WANT to be president, which makes her appealing!
694551515747479552 2016-02-02 16:02:40 UTC <rtraister> @pblest Fiery speeches have been since election. When she was IN a campaign, she was critiqued as wooden, inauthentic, a bad campaigner.
694551318707441664 2016-02-02 16:01:53 UTC <rtraister> @pblest For ex: Warren's moments of viral popularity didn't really come while she was campaigning. The you didn't build that was before.
694551221319929856 2016-02-02 16:01:29 UTC <rtraister> @pblest there're differences in how we treat women when they're in forward threatening motion versus when they're static, in jobs.
694551096275161089 2016-02-02 16:01:00 UTC <rtraister> @pblest Also, we think of her as a yelling heroine of the left, but...
694550859909337088 2016-02-02 16:00:03 UTC <rtraister> @pblest I think she'd face some challenges related to HRC's challenges-my guess is she'd get hit harder than Bernie on foreign policy.
694550506128195584 2016-02-02 15:58:39 UTC <rtraister> @pblest But I don't think it's as easy as subbing Warren for Sanders (or Clinton), for a couple of reasons.
694550332941144064 2016-02-02 15:57:58 UTC <rtraister> @pblest I don't directly dismiss it. I think there's a possibility she could be doing as well & wrote a piece last year hoping she'd run.
694549685609107456 2016-02-02 15:55:23 UTC <rtraister> @JARRODMYRICK @jarrodmyrick @JessicaValenti why are you obsessed with bros?
694543587166523392 2016-02-02 15:31:09 UTC <rtraister> @overlayered @JamilSmith Nope, it's actually not about that at all.
694543285193461760 2016-02-02 15:29:57 UTC <rtraister> @slow_soft_late No, others have been confused. I filed at 2 am! It probably could have been clearer. My oof.
694542913028648962 2016-02-02 15:28:29 UTC <rtraister> @staceynewman Of course it matters, but if this is about wording in my piece, it was because it was a tie when I filed.
694542496978845697 2016-02-02 15:26:49 UTC <rtraister> @chaosprime @ManWithoutPants @Jeevesmeister Except for literally not everybody and she's not running for president. But I wish she had!
694542203700580355 2016-02-02 15:25:39 UTC <rtraister> @DougHenwood Well, no one's using that line here, especially @saraeckel who I believe is a strong Bernie supporter.
694541932874354688 2016-02-02 15:24:35 UTC <rtraister> @DikaiosLogos Agree re some of above, disagree re some. Your critiques are valid! Not challenging them. Just offering gender context.
694541217707757568 2016-02-02 15:21:44 UTC <rtraister> @dougom @jbouie this is kind of what my piece today is abouthttp://nymag.com/thecut/2016/02/what-hillary-learned-about-running-while-female.html
694541050283687936 2016-02-02 15:21:04 UTC <rtraister> @slow_soft_late sentence before says she could NEVER be these things; i..e she couldn't have been a revolutionary (& viable pres candidate)
694540469502623744 2016-02-02 15:18:46 UTC <rtraister> Well, two hundred plus years of history support that assumption. But other than that, sure, I'm speculating.  https://twitter.com/KnowWorkNoMoney/status/694534265959133184
694539818257219585 2016-02-02 15:16:11 UTC <rtraister> @DikaiosLogos @saraeckel I'm not suggesting that dislike of her is invalid! Just trying to put some of her history/problems in context.
694539531241013250 2016-02-02 15:15:02 UTC <rtraister> @DikaiosLogos Warren appears not to WANT to be president, and strategizes less around it, which makes her much more appealing.
694539457169616898 2016-02-02 15:14:45 UTC <rtraister> @DikaiosLogos less, different, I don't think we can say. Also much of what HRC is blamed for are contortions she made to become presidential
694538765071749120 2016-02-02 15:12:00 UTC <rtraister> @staceynewman it was a tie when I went to bed!
694532749932249089 2016-02-02 14:48:06 UTC <rtraister> @KnowWorkNoMoney I'm afraid you've misread my piece. Its point is that she could never have done so & been a viable candidate.
694528726558703616 2016-02-02 14:32:06 UTC <rtraister> @pescami @TheCut So they threaten less by dint of their individual identities.
694528358282084352 2016-02-02 14:30:38 UTC <rtraister> @pescami @TheCut because for the most part, while their IDENTITIES threaten the status quo/power structure, their policies don't.
694525983337091072 2016-02-02 14:21:12 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel Well, look, I NEVER thought I'd hear a female candidate talking about repealing Hyde! Never in my life. So I've seen that now.
694525611084226560 2016-02-02 14:19:44 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel Me too. And no matter what, as @jbouie and @mattyglesias have argued, this forces party to recalibrate=this is great.
694525173437980675 2016-02-02 14:17:59 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel DEFINITELY. Also why Edwards could be more prog in 08 than the black guy or the woman, already considered radical by dint of IDs.
694524829878349824 2016-02-02 14:16:37 UTC <rtraister> @DikaiosLogos @saraeckel There is no "if male" HRC. HRC is who she is in part bc she's been formed by being a woman in a male world.
694524543373832192 2016-02-02 14:15:29 UTC <rtraister> @DikaiosLogos She's not, however, running for president. And if she were, she'd bump into a lot of related roadblocks.
694524192616767494 2016-02-02 14:14:05 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel This is old, knotty stuff constraining which figures get to play which kinds of parts. Exciting that Bernie gets to be Bernie btw
694523909392220160 2016-02-02 14:12:58 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel My point always is only that it's more complex that the basic storylines (in either direction) permit us to see easily.
694523795940450304 2016-02-02 14:12:31 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel I think that all that's happening is ultimately good for those who care about econ inequality, feminism & a lefter Dem party.
694523500942508032 2016-02-02 14:11:20 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel sure! Part of what's happening is that she's part of altering these paradigms. There's been an enormous amount of change.
694518376069218304 2016-02-02 13:50:59 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel again, that doesn't damn them! it just makes it harder.
694518303864295425 2016-02-02 13:50:41 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel a lot of it is that we still see women selling themselves for a big job as fundamentally unnatural, thus performative.
694516470668197888 2016-02-02 13:43:24 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel I do think she could have won. But I think we fool ourselves if we think she would have escaped some of HRC snares.
694516323884343296 2016-02-02 13:42:49 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel And we forget that when she was RUNNING in Mass, she too was called inauthentic, wooden, unlikable, a bad campaigner.
694516211678322688 2016-02-02 13:42:23 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel I think she would have been hit on foreign policy harder than Bernie has been.
694515973240537088 2016-02-02 13:41:26 UTC <rtraister> @saraeckel Though honestly, I think she would have faced MANY related (if different, because she's different) challenges.

694387149970489344 2016-02-01 05:09:32 UTC <rtraister> @BlueBoxDave With a strong speech I thought.
694387113643606016 2016-02-01 05:09:23 UTC <rtraister> @BlueBoxDave I think it was smart. She got earlier viewers, stepped on Cruz and also stepped on the weird victory report.
694386421570916352 2016-02-01 05:06:38 UTC <rtraister> I think Andrea Mitchell is walking back the victory declaration news. But I'm not sure.
694382450735194116 2016-02-01 04:50:51 UTC <rtraister> Both HRC and Bernie energetic and upbeat. This is a good night for Democrats. And Democratic socialists.

694376988790910976 2016-02-01 04:29:09 UTC <rtraister> This was either a terrible move or a major power move, cutting over Cruz's speech.

694374986275016704 2016-02-01 04:21:12 UTC <rtraister> Okay, so maybe she didn't in fact declare victory? In which case... [Emily Litella] nevermind.

691990785256980480 2016-01-26 14:27:14 UTC <rtraister> Seattle! So lucky to get to talk about my new book on single women with @StephanieCoontz on March 10. Please come:http://www.thestranger.com/events/23446396/rebecca-traister-with-stephanie-coontz-all-the-single-ladies-are-taking-over
691831211312947205 2016-01-25 03:53:09 UTC <rtraister> "When I'm actually in office, they say really nice things about me...then when I run..." this is so true and not just about Republicans.
691829681209884673 2016-01-25 03:47:04 UTC <rtraister> @lizadonnelly Draw away! More later...
691829078865907714 2016-01-25 03:44:40 UTC <rtraister> @lizadonnelly are you selling these?
691828752939139072 2016-01-25 03:43:22 UTC <rtraister> @DougHenwood @joanwalsh I was mostly kidding. Though I will say he was better tonight than I've seen him.
691827635031314433 2016-01-25 03:38:56 UTC <rtraister> @joanwalsh @DougHenwood O'Malley in middle created HRC disadvantage, but I think lots turned in late & missed Bernie. So MOM is only winner
691825654321582080 2016-01-25 03:31:04 UTC <rtraister> Great answer on young people's enthusiasm for Bernie: "I'm totally happy to see young people involved in any way. That's what we want!"
691825336632393728 2016-01-25 03:29:48 UTC <rtraister> "I'm so proud. The three of us have run a campaign talking about differences we have on issues. It's a tough campaign, and it should be."
691824829738139648 2016-01-25 03:27:47 UTC <rtraister> Really if I never hear the Ginger Rogers line again in my life it will be too soon.
691823243141988353 2016-01-25 03:21:29 UTC <rtraister> Was just about to complain about this thing being too long and then I remembered: HEY THIS IS NOT ON A WEEKEND THAT IS BEING RUINED.
691823062736576512 2016-01-25 03:20:46 UTC <rtraister> "I'm not here to praise you, Iowa; I'm here to challenge you." This guy is on lyrical fire.
691822432924102656 2016-01-25 03:18:16 UTC <rtraister> Hold strong at your caucus! America is scanning the horizon! Hand extended, O'Malley appears ready to break into rousing song!
691821306933813248 2016-01-25 03:13:47 UTC <rtraister> O'Malley is doing well tonight. I mean, FWIW.
691810400401235968 2016-01-25 02:30:27 UTC <rtraister> Oh god Chris Cuomo please stop talking.
691808311331651588 2016-01-25 02:22:09 UTC <rtraister> Please don't shake your finger anymore.
691786150588108802 2016-01-25 00:54:05 UTC <rtraister> Totally fascinating meditation on/profile of HRC (& great interview) by @rubycramer:http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/hillary-clinton-wants-to-talk-to-you-about-love-and-kindness#.mr5EBQaMz
691780101659344896 2016-01-25 00:30:03 UTC <rtraister> @SLDdc @Politics_Prose pretty sure that's just the price of the book!
691779757839642624 2016-01-25 00:28:41 UTC <rtraister> @AlanaEichner @Politics_Prose can't wait to meet you!
691752112351547392 2016-01-25 22:38:50 UTC <rtraister> Wow.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/691751122567086080
691651758943293445 2016-01-25 16:00:04 UTC <rtraister> Also, hope someone's writing Scully-HRC piece re pragmatist ladies, squelching dreams of male counterparts. Bc I'm not. But I'm thinking it.
691651095635050497 2016-01-25 15:57:26 UTC <rtraister> Also, here is my old piece on my love for Scully. Because I still love Scully. So much.http://www.salon.com/2008/07/24/scully_2/
691651004178259968 2016-01-25 15:57:04 UTC <rtraister> Hey X-Files twitter, my DVR got screwed up by the football game last night. Is there a solution?
691086055701942272 2016-01-23 02:32:10 UTC <rtraister> @JAMyerson no
691051143238152192 2016-01-23 00:13:26 UTC <rtraister> @joanwalsh @KatrinaNation @KathaPollitt I'm afraid there is no relief from this.
691049175933423616 2016-01-23 00:05:37 UTC <rtraister> @meghanor @magiciansbook @aoscott @emilynussbaum I just set off smoke alarm roasting meatballs, which seems less well earned, somehow...

690711809796481024 2016-01-22 01:45:02 UTC <rtraister> @snowyandtootsie yes!
690597338734268418 2016-01-22 18:10:10 UTC <rtraister> Huh.https://twitter.com/berniesanders/status/690337356411330560

690383566119813120 2016-01-21 04:00:43 UTC <rtraister> NARAL's @ilyseh expands "establishment" critique to Sanders' choice not to make abortion access central to campaign:https://medium.com/@Ilysehogue/imsoestablishment-why-words-and-the-absence-of-them-matter-584c0b260357#.gqszaf9dg
690368436476706818 2016-01-21 03:00:36 UTC <rtraister> @theshrillest @anildash @jbouie recap: voted twice for man she now believes 2b criminal, will make feminist point by NOT voting for his wife
690367228722700288 2016-01-21 02:55:48 UTC <rtraister> @anildash @theshrillest @jbouie I'd also argue that the bright line logic she lays out here is pretty murky.
690366972534636544 2016-01-21 02:54:47 UTC <rtraister> @anildash @theshrillest @jbouie I respect bright lines that prompt you to vote against a candidate. Not ones that prompt you not to vote.
690364087109341184 2016-01-21 02:43:19 UTC <rtraister> @jbouie well as she writes, she already got her extra postpartum hospital days during 1st Clinton admin, so what's to lose now?
690363084804849665 2016-01-21 02:39:20 UTC <rtraister> "This year, for the first time in my voting life, Im staying home." I guess not voting is the real feminist heroism http://time.com/4177436/hillary-clinton-juanita-broaddrick/
690229859432468483 2016-01-21 17:49:56 UTC <rtraister> Pretty excited to be reading an interview with @irin about #NotoriousRBG & find that she's reading my book: http://www.designsponge.com/2016/01/reading-spaces-irin-carmon.html

689653505091592192 2016-01-19 03:39:43 UTC <rtraister> @ASFried @esd2000 @SamLachman But in bigger picture, yes, Repubs and some Dems would fight any tax payer money for abortion.
689653424699346944 2016-01-19 03:39:24 UTC <rtraister> @ASFried @esd2000 @SamLachman I'm not sure about that, because Hyde is rider attacked to appropriations bill every year, no?
689652330569023490 2016-01-19 03:35:03 UTC <rtraister> @esd2000 @ASFried FWIW: His campaign told @SamLachman that the plan WOULD include abortion. Just didn't mention in plan.
689648732309164033 2016-01-19 03:20:45 UTC <rtraister> Yes, I forgot, also @NARAL is part of the establishment.https://twitter.com/irin/status/689643889309917184
689645669699690496 2016-01-19 03:08:35 UTC <rtraister> @laurenduca @maddow @PPact @HRC The question was about those two endorsements.
689645213296517120 2016-01-19 03:06:46 UTC <rtraister> "...we're taking on the political establishment...some of these groups are in fact part of the establishment." It was weird.
689645099127545856 2016-01-19 03:06:19 UTC <rtraister> Asked about the Planned Parenthood and HRC endorsements, he said, "We're taking on not only Wall Street & economic establishment..."
689644436574322688 2016-01-19 03:03:41 UTC <rtraister> Wow, I think Bernie on @maddow just now described @PPact & @HRC, which endorsed Hillary, as part of the establishment he's "taking on."
689614346889072640 2016-01-19 01:04:07 UTC <rtraister> Oh @allinwithchris, doth I hear the dulcet tones of Sarah Palin?
