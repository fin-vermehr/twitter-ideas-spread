840933112183959552 2017-03-12 14:30:52 UTC <teppimcenery> Well said! @SpeakerRyan and @HouseGOP are showing their true colors with this bill.... that they are NOT Christians and NOT prolife.https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/840229270546866178
840767832082251776 2017-03-11 03:34:06 UTC <teppimcenery> The responses on this are great. My first thought was a science book.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/840734347284082688
840604367162089472 2017-03-11 16:44:33 UTC <teppimcenery> @RVAwonk thanks for sharing this. After @davidfrum thread this morning, it brought me back from the brink. 
840603626481553408 2017-03-11 16:41:36 UTC <teppimcenery> .@davidfrum I read this thread after yours so I didn't go jump from the nearest bridge.  Keep the faith. We need all the help we can get.https://twitter.com/ericgarland/status/840557413656858625

839830192466059265 2017-03-09 13:28:15 UTC <teppimcenery> @Wolfe321 @RVAwonk since @KevinMKruse tweeted this, it keeps popping up in my head when I read stuff like this.pic.twitter.com/1XXJIAYa2t
839825897922441218 2017-03-09 13:11:11 UTC <teppimcenery> .@PatTiberi except Dems didn't "rush" ACA through. 15 month process & full CBO score. Recall all facts, not just 1s to fit your narrative.
839822269794959361 2017-03-09 12:56:46 UTC <teppimcenery> .@PatTiberi Tom Cotton forgot to tag you in this tweet, but I've got your back.https://twitter.com/BraddJaffy/status/839814961740328960
839519285873618944 2017-03-08 16:52:49 UTC <teppimcenery> .@PatTiberi An informative article you should read before falling in line on a plan that COMPLETELY SUCKS FOR YOUR DISTRICT. Not Pam in NE.https://twitter.com/darreldrowland/status/839219582099423233
839518566470799360 2017-03-08 16:49:58 UTC <teppimcenery> .@PatTiberi How about you come up with a better plan than ACA before parading your non- constituent stories around Twitter?https://twitter.com/ChrisCJackson/status/838966783579152385
839504168654106624 2017-03-08 15:52:45 UTC <teppimcenery> @PatTiberi and these are premiums of PRIVATE ins cos. What were their CEO's salaries and bonuses those years??
839503871126941696 2017-03-08 15:51:34 UTC <teppimcenery> @PatTiberi also, premiums grew at their slowest pace in DECADES under ACA.
839503097449832448 2017-03-08 15:48:30 UTC <teppimcenery> @PatTiberi Maybe she has too many iPhones. And Arizona isn't your district either.
839502755135897601 2017-03-08 15:47:08 UTC <teppimcenery> @PatTiberi @OhioDistrict12 Don't just choose stories that fit the narrative you want. We as your constituents deserve better.
839501961091231744 2017-03-08 15:43:59 UTC <teppimcenery> @PatTiberi @OhioDistrict12 you represent a very diverse district. Your work needs to reflect that.
839501638213767168 2017-03-08 15:42:42 UTC <teppimcenery> @PatTiberi @OhioDistrict12 yes,  I don't see one story of support. They're out there, if you'd ask. I heard many at the town hall you dodged
839498806840463362 2017-03-08 15:31:27 UTC <teppimcenery> @PatTiberi perhaps it's because insurers like Aetna left the market to try to sabotage it. Insurance companies are greedy and soulless.
839497996962250752 2017-03-08 15:28:14 UTC <teppimcenery> @PatTiberi uh, Nebraska isn't in District 12 last time I checked. Let's hear the specifics of "Pam's" case, since you brought it up.
839398257063231488 2017-03-08 08:51:54 UTC <teppimcenery> Quality health care should not bankrupt ANY FAMILY. Financial stress is unnecessary burden to put on families already dealing with illness.https://twitter.com/anindita/status/839155740082384897

838950550909648896 2017-03-06 03:12:52 UTC <teppimcenery> This is an excellent thread with great examples of why defunding @PPact is no good.....economically, socially, morally, & fundamentally.https://twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/817126599678115840

838911707879784449 2017-03-06 00:38:32 UTC <teppimcenery> @HouseGOP @PatTiberi this is a joke. Pat, I'll call you tomorrow to explain.

829142410076811264 2017-02-07 01:38:49 UTC <teppimcenery> @7777MYNAME I can see your point. But I'm specifically talking about the $ a cabinet nominee paid to a senator who votes on her appt.

777347809406312450 2016-09-17 03:25:34 UTC <teppimcenery> @GavinNewsom @BernieSanders said it best. Vote 3rd party in smaller contests, not presidential.

770733931415085056 2016-08-30 21:24:23 UTC <teppimcenery> @PolitiFactOhio can you help me with the ad I've been seeing regarding Strickland/deficit/rainy day fund/ etc? Thanks!
770623619064033281 2016-08-30 14:06:02 UTC <teppimcenery> @johnlegend @chrissyteigen like I needed ANOTHER reason to think you two are the ultimate couple? Now I can imagine you watching buckeyes..
761925009703047168 2016-08-06 14:00:52 UTC <teppimcenery> @nytimes as if parents flying with children as there solely to inconvenience you. Yep, you are the center of the universe.
761924722191982596 2016-08-06 13:59:44 UTC <teppimcenery> @nytimes what if you don't like the gift? Should the parent get your address to send a gift to apologize for being a shitty gift giver?
761924155352682496 2016-08-06 13:57:29 UTC <teppimcenery> @nytimes also would some trinkets from the dollar store or a few pieces of chocolate really excuse the offending behavior for you?
761922663690473473 2016-08-06 13:51:33 UTC <teppimcenery> @nytimes would some trinkets from the dollar store or a few pieces of chocolate really excuse this horrible slight in your eyes?
761921587595583488 2016-08-06 13:47:16 UTC <teppimcenery> @nytimes perhaps obese people should give gifts too? Or people who snore? Or don't practice good hygiene? Or get air sick? Or get anxious?

752243209137426432 2016-07-10 20:48:51 UTC <teppimcenery> The next time someone says 'all lives matter,' show them these 5 paragraphs http://fusion.net/story/170591/the-next-time-someone-says-all-lives-matter-show-them-these-5-paragraphs/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialshare&utm_content=theme_top_mobile via @fusion
751553216119181313 2016-07-08 23:07:04 UTC <teppimcenery> @GavinNewsom 9/11 not an attack against police. I believe that comment helps shape narrative that BLM is a terrorist group-which it is not.

748146903506817026 2016-06-29 13:31:36 UTC <teppimcenery> This is why our @POTUS will NOT refer to them as radical Islamic extremists. Don't play their game.https://twitter.com/trpressoffice/status/748067498948464640
745219631397347328 2016-06-21 11:39:40 UTC <teppimcenery> @SenSanders @robdelaney agreed! So sad that in US we have gofundme pages for medical bills. Esp people like 14yo Kalamazoo victim.
