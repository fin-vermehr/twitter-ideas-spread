Mostly, for also believing in our school and @ps42q. The Rockaway peninsula salutes your stand.  We will match and exceed the confidence shown!
970007493484122113 2018-03-03 18:46:22 UTC <DanielAlicea> @ps42q @BrianPiccolo53 @isaaccarmignani So many of our students are still in transitional homes, about five years later. And the very real challenges of a burgeoning diverse community of students with disabilities & ELLs are unique. This is 50% of our makeup. Notwithstanding, we are seeing GROWTH! @42strongU

966114966507065344 2018-02-20 00:58:52 UTC <DanielAlicea> @HardballChris @TimRyan @hardball Agreed. The interruptions more and more incoherent and aggressive. I want to see "hard hitting" journalism but not rudeness.  As for the dementia, a few weeks ago he did an entire show where "animation" was his word for "automation". No producer in his ear dare to correct?!

If we did shots for the amount of times he interrupts guests, we'd be slammed every night. Yet, when he's corrected or interrupted like the other night when a guest corrected Chris' senile "Homefront" " to "Homeland" it got tense.

I know that rather than proselytize many potential converts are 'disabused'.  I read this latter practice dates to times of persecution as a safeguard.
