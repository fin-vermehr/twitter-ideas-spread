822547803989753856 2017-01-20 20:54:13 UTC <elthie> I am so opposed to funding unchecked religious education that teaches garbage science. There are better solutions.
822545621546573824 2017-01-20 20:45:32 UTC <elthie> But I will continue looking at more studies and hope we will find a solution! I think it starts with wealth redistribution
822545319414079494 2017-01-20 20:44:20 UTC <elthie> All studies I have seen show marginal, perhaps negligible, improvements in scores at charters. Esp in MI.
822544926084923393 2017-01-20 20:42:47 UTC <elthie> I'm not opposed to school choice in theory. But not when sending $ to religious schools, and not without accountability
822542699475701762 2017-01-20 20:33:56 UTC <elthie> and DeVos' strategy of choice without accountability is excellent proof of that IMHO
822542425843437568 2017-01-20 20:32:51 UTC <elthie> I think we need radical refunding first. We're on track to leave low-income students father behind without it
822535327558627328 2017-01-20 20:04:38 UTC <elthie> I see serious risks for poor districts/states in relying on local funding alone. Esp funding via property taxes
822526353182330880 2017-01-20 19:28:59 UTC <elthie> We disagree on the issue of federal funding requiring some level of accountability, I guess
822526169228578816 2017-01-20 19:28:15 UTC <elthie> None of that has anything to do with Warren's opinion. Many Dems--I didn't say prez candidates--support school choice today
822518812599721984 2017-01-20 18:59:01 UTC <elthie> @AAPolicyForum Hey @WreckaFlames
822506560530235392 2017-01-20 18:10:20 UTC <elthie> to the best of my knowledge Warren explicitly chastised DeVos for funneling $ into schools that aren't held accountable
822506349816737793 2017-01-20 18:09:29 UTC <elthie> I think most Dems are open to school choice. But unlike DeVos they want equal accountability for those alternative schools

747617719877570560 2016-06-27 02:28:49 UTC <elthie> Do dragons get tired on long overseas journeys? Can they swim? If they land on a boat, would it sink? #GameofThrones @BillNye

747616759700688898 2016-06-27 02:25:00 UTC <elthie> Jon Snow, I'm real happy for you and I'ma let you finish, but Robb Stark was the foxiest King of the North of all time.

747610708251189248 2016-06-27 02:00:57 UTC <elthie> It turns out that, much like life, Game of Thrones is 100x more interesting when the women are in power. Lord almighty.

746435327028527104 2016-06-24 20:10:24 UTC <elthie> @verververde Yes! And Star Wars has literally nothing to do with Chicago. If it were otherwise there would at least be some logical argument
746428440002306048 2016-06-24 19:43:02 UTC <elthie> I love Star Wars as much as the next person, but every day of my life I'll choose Lake Michigan over a shrine to ewoks.

746425405981200389 2016-06-24 19:30:59 UTC <elthie> @britticisms @mhowe1980 Disagree. Anyway if Lucas really wanted his museum in Chicago, he could have negotiated NOT to be on lakefront.

731336929199849472 2016-05-13 04:14:46 UTC <elthie> Twin Peaks was so great tonight and Chance was so great today and I think Chicago just reversed the Friday the 13th curse.

727351377794453505 2016-05-02 04:17:36 UTC <elthie> This is like watching a house centipede scurry across your ceiling. You're too far away to stop it, but it's too terrifying to look away
727350624615030785 2016-05-02 04:14:37 UTC <elthie> Dear diary,  I never thought 2 people clasping hands in celebration would make me want to vomit. Then today happenedpic.twitter.com/vTujm58S3r

727211599417741313 2016-05-02 19:02:10 UTC <elthie> @MerylWilliams Oh, it is so good! And really short seasons. Very dark and British and lady-centric, which are all things I love.
727193251682344960 2016-05-02 17:49:16 UTC <elthie> Has anyone in my Twittersphere watched Happy Valley? Because I binge-watched the first season last night and have SO MANY FEELINGS.

727161433037901824 2016-05-02 15:42:50 UTC <elthie> @britticisms @ErnestWilkins & I didn't see much calling out of Swift's collaborations after her AotY Grammy win. (Contrast w/ Beyonce/Beck)
727160028852064257 2016-05-02 15:37:15 UTC <elthie> @ErnestWilkins @britticisms Also said much more condescendingly about lady hip-hop stars over someone like Taylor Swift, imo

726247995470127104 2016-04-29 03:13:09 UTC <elthie> Literally did not know what a blow poke was until The Staircase brought it up seven hundred million times.

725153152056455168 2016-04-26 02:42:38 UTC <elthie> @oliviabrestal SAME!

724704735094276099 2016-04-25 21:00:47 UTC <elthie> This has been your afternoon LEMONADE update. More to come this evening.
724704515556028417 2016-04-25 20:59:55 UTC <elthie> My current fav song on LEMONADE is All Night because it's great. If Beyonce only sampled Spottieottiedopaliscious forever I wouldn't be mad.
724702648721661954 2016-04-25 20:52:30 UTC <elthie> @pitchfork @fatherjohnmisty @Beyonce cc: @lemmie581
724701718550859778 2016-04-25 20:48:48 UTC <elthie> My current fav line on LEMONADE is "Stop interrupting my grinding," because ladies, we have all been there. #boybye
724684190323757057 2016-04-25 19:39:09 UTC <elthie> Why is everyone burying the lede that Matthew Lillard is gonna be in Twin Peaks
724657522137767938 2016-04-25 17:53:11 UTC <elthie> So many things to be angry about today. Piers Morgan. @RahmEmanuel. @ChiPubSchools. Thank god we have Beyonce.pic.twitter.com/AeXAHiASnh
724656625378820098 2016-04-25 17:49:37 UTC <elthie> Getting rid of Troy LaRaviere is Rahm's attempt to silence a vocal schools critic #StandwithTroy http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/04/21/getting-rid-of-troy-laraviere-is-rahms-attempt-to-silence-a-vocal-schools-critic
724653637700603904 2016-04-25 17:37:45 UTC <elthie> Interrupting your regularly scheduled LEMONADE programming to bring you this v important news. #StandWithTroyhttps://twitter.com/DNAinfoCHI/status/724649981416759296
724651616062857217 2016-04-25 17:29:43 UTC <elthie> It shouldn't be a surprise. @ChiPubSchools has routinely failed students, educators, and, in turn, the city for years. #StandWithTroy
724650832378118144 2016-04-25 17:26:36 UTC <elthie> Basically, @ChiPubSchools doesn't want people questioning authority? Very American of you! @RahmEmanuel #StandWithTroy
724650546112671745 2016-04-25 17:25:28 UTC <elthie> This is bonkers. I saw @TroyLaRaviere speak at @NewberryLibrary and he was a breath of fresh air. #StandWithTroyhttps://twitter.com/DNAinfoCHI/status/724649981416759296
724648961886310400 2016-04-25 17:19:10 UTC <elthie> Piers Morgan doesn't like it when entertainers get political, and I don't like it when he speaks, ever. You can't always get what you want!
724639783448768512 2016-04-25 16:42:42 UTC <elthie> I am but a humble scholar in the halls of Bey's academia https://twitter.com/briannawellen/status/724638749695578114
724638414952366082 2016-04-25 16:37:15 UTC <elthie> "POP STARS CAN CREATE NARRATIVE PERSONAS, TOO!!!" she screamed into the void
724637572580933632 2016-04-25 16:33:55 UTC <elthie> It's bizarre that everyone maps Beyonce's songs word-for-word onto her personal life. Pop stars can create narrative personas, too
724637126705483776 2016-04-25 16:32:08 UTC <elthie> The New Yorker piece on Lemonade is an interesting analysis, but WHY does everyone assume Beyonce's songs are autobiographical???
724631295817605120 2016-04-25 16:08:58 UTC <elthie> @lemmie581 Ah yes I saw that ! On Hold Up! Which is my current fav song mostly because I can't get past it SINCE IT'S SO GOOD.

966593435900588032 2018-02-22 08:40:08 UTC <elthie> I usually do the NYT crossword just before bed. It is soothing and challenging, and I often see clues that remind me of people I love and miss. It is a good practice to wind down the day, to stop and take a breath.
966479854454501376 2018-02-21 01:08:48 UTC <elthie> @hollysmcbride @cautiousmonster Same, they remind me of Ira and the Douche (a la Parks and Rec)
966188658134016001 2018-02-20 05:51:41 UTC <elthie> @cautiousmonster Soup and cults!! Two soothing things!! I think it makes us feel better to know that, whatever terrible life choices we may be making, at least we aren't drinking the literal Koolaid

822547803989753856 2017-01-20 20:54:13 UTC <elthie> I am so opposed to funding unchecked religious education that teaches garbage science. There are better solutions.
822545621546573824 2017-01-20 20:45:32 UTC <elthie> But I will continue looking at more studies and hope we will find a solution! I think it starts with wealth redistribution
822545319414079494 2017-01-20 20:44:20 UTC <elthie> All studies I have seen show marginal, perhaps negligible, improvements in scores at charters. Esp in MI.
822544926084923393 2017-01-20 20:42:47 UTC <elthie> I'm not opposed to school choice in theory. But not when sending $ to religious schools, and not without accountability
822542699475701762 2017-01-20 20:33:56 UTC <elthie> and DeVos' strategy of choice without accountability is excellent proof of that IMHO
822542425843437568 2017-01-20 20:32:51 UTC <elthie> I think we need radical refunding first. We're on track to leave low-income students father behind without it
822535327558627328 2017-01-20 20:04:38 UTC <elthie> I see serious risks for poor districts/states in relying on local funding alone. Esp funding via property taxes
822526353182330880 2017-01-20 19:28:59 UTC <elthie> We disagree on the issue of federal funding requiring some level of accountability, I guess
822526169228578816 2017-01-20 19:28:15 UTC <elthie> None of that has anything to do with Warren's opinion. Many Dems--I didn't say prez candidates--support school choice today
822518812599721984 2017-01-20 18:59:01 UTC <elthie> @AAPolicyForum Hey @WreckaFlames
822506560530235392 2017-01-20 18:10:20 UTC <elthie> to the best of my knowledge Warren explicitly chastised DeVos for funneling $ into schools that aren't held accountable
822506349816737793 2017-01-20 18:09:29 UTC <elthie> I think most Dems are open to school choice. But unlike DeVos they want equal accountability for those alternative schools

751167330684694528 2016-07-07 21:33:42 UTC <elthie> Violence in Chicago (a city whose poverty is tied to DECADES of racial discrimination) does not excuse excessive violence by cops elsewhere.

746435327028527104 2016-06-24 20:10:24 UTC <elthie> @verververde Yes! And Star Wars has literally nothing to do with Chicago. If it were otherwise there would at least be some logical argument
746428440002306048 2016-06-24 19:43:02 UTC <elthie> I love Star Wars as much as the next person, but every day of my life I'll choose Lake Michigan over a shrine to ewoks.

746426303591649280 2016-06-24 19:34:33 UTC <elthie> @britticisms @mhowe1980 I don't see how this means Chicago doesn't care about the arts? Sounds like George Lucas doesn't care about Chicago
746425405981200389 2016-06-24 19:30:59 UTC <elthie> @britticisms @mhowe1980 Disagree. Anyway if Lucas really wanted his museum in Chicago, he could have negotiated NOT to be on lakefront.

727211599417741313 2016-05-02 19:02:10 UTC <elthie> @MerylWilliams Oh, it is so good! And really short seasons. Very dark and British and lady-centric, which are all things I love.

727161433037901824 2016-05-02 15:42:50 UTC <elthie> @britticisms @ErnestWilkins & I didn't see much calling out of Swift's collaborations after her AotY Grammy win. (Contrast w/ Beyonce/Beck)
727160028852064257 2016-05-02 15:37:15 UTC <elthie> @ErnestWilkins @britticisms Also said much more condescendingly about lady hip-hop stars over someone like Taylor Swift, imo

724704735094276099 2016-04-25 21:00:47 UTC <elthie> This has been your afternoon LEMONADE update. More to come this evening.
724704515556028417 2016-04-25 20:59:55 UTC <elthie> My current fav song on LEMONADE is All Night because it's great. If Beyonce only sampled Spottieottiedopaliscious forever I wouldn't be mad.

724701718550859778 2016-04-25 20:48:48 UTC <elthie> My current fav line on LEMONADE is "Stop interrupting my grinding," because ladies, we have all been there. #boybye
724684190323757057 2016-04-25 19:39:09 UTC <elthie> Why is everyone burying the lede that Matthew Lillard is gonna be in Twin Peaks

724651616062857217 2016-04-25 17:29:43 UTC <elthie> It shouldn't be a surprise. @ChiPubSchools has routinely failed students, educators, and, in turn, the city for years. #StandWithTroy
724650832378118144 2016-04-25 17:26:36 UTC <elthie> Basically, @ChiPubSchools doesn't want people questioning authority? Very American of you! @RahmEmanuel #StandWithTroy
724650546112671745 2016-04-25 17:25:28 UTC <elthie> This is bonkers. I saw @TroyLaRaviere speak at @NewberryLibrary and he was a breath of fresh air. #StandWithTroyhttps://twitter.com/DNAinfoCHI/status/724649981416759296
724648961886310400 2016-04-25 17:19:10 UTC <elthie> Piers Morgan doesn't like it when entertainers get political, and I don't like it when he speaks, ever. You can't always get what you want!
724639783448768512 2016-04-25 16:42:42 UTC <elthie> I am but a humble scholar in the halls of Bey's academia https://twitter.com/briannawellen/status/724638749695578114
724638414952366082 2016-04-25 16:37:15 UTC <elthie> "POP STARS CAN CREATE NARRATIVE PERSONAS, TOO!!!" she screamed into the void
724637572580933632 2016-04-25 16:33:55 UTC <elthie> It's bizarre that everyone maps Beyonce's songs word-for-word onto her personal life. Pop stars can create narrative personas, too
724637126705483776 2016-04-25 16:32:08 UTC <elthie> The New Yorker piece on Lemonade is an interesting analysis, but WHY does everyone assume Beyonce's songs are autobiographical???
724631295817605120 2016-04-25 16:08:58 UTC <elthie> @lemmie581 Ah yes I saw that ! On Hold Up! Which is my current fav song mostly because I can't get past it SINCE IT'S SO GOOD.
