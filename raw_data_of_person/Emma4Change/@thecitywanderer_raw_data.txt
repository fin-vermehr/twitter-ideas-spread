969367750627004417 2018-03-01 00:24:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb Aw thanks Devin
969367437543124993 2018-03-01 00:23:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism And theres plenty of century old office space in midtown thats not getting rented....
969367104817389569 2018-03-01 00:21:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism If that was class b or c office space, then they were getting prob $50/sf or maybe even less. If they could show their lenders that they had major tenants who would pay $100/sf or more and retailers who would pay whatever crazy retail rent they want to charge ($200?) I can see it
969362568249831425 2018-03-01 00:03:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism So what? Its still insanely expensive. No one financing a major office project in NYC expects to recoup lots of money in the short-term
969359886663512065 2018-03-01 23:53:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism How do you think any major office project pencils? Even the rents at One Vandy probably would not seem high enough to justify the cost of construction.
969355151495585794 2018-03-01 23:34:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism Levinson is one of the smartest brokers in the biz and he's worked with those big financial tenants since like the 80s. Keep in mind JP Morgan could be paying for part of their buildout - they needed a huge amount of new space and clearly they wanted that area near 270 park
969353382476558336 2018-03-01 23:27:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism based on the average asking rents in the hood, they are definitely at the top end

969263226327388160 2018-03-01 17:28:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro i'm sure!
969261915972210688 2018-03-01 17:23:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism but it looks like you're supposed to be like an owner or someone else involved in the property in order to register for the notifications? weird
969259963037241344 2018-03-01 17:15:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism I did not even realize that was a thing!! it looks like you can still do that though
969258756507865093 2018-03-01 17:11:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @WileyNorvell @DanielKayHertz @MosesNYC yeah but the question is where do the proceeds of the condo sales go? back to the city?
969258502232223744 2018-03-01 17:10:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism right. but how would the income cap structure make it illegal to rent out the unit?
969257082653478913 2018-03-01 17:04:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism what's not clear to me is what the actual income caps are... based on the HPD term sheet it looks like it's 110 to 130 percent AMI, which is at least on the higher side
969256077815664641 2018-03-01 17:00:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i assume so. i don't know the structure of how these deals are financed - i assume the city gets a cut and the developers get a cut, in order to help pay back whatever loans they took out to finance that $29 million cost of construction. cc @MosesNYC @WileyNorvell
969255143307956224 2018-03-01 16:56:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism why would renting them out be illegal? and you mean stuck bc they will be hard to resell at those prices?

965434297393057792 2018-02-18 03:54:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JRSterne @chloechik614 basically yes! but it depends on the round - pools go to five and DEs/medal rounds go to 15 (and fencing does have overtime)

964210157746974721 2018-02-15 18:49:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @MarketUrbanism i know what SRO landlords say about CONH. And I am sure that @bradlander does too
964209916075364352 2018-02-15 18:48:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @MarketUrbanism also the new legislation is not set up the same way as the old CONH process, and it allows landlords to set aside 20 or 25 percent of their units as "permanently affordable" instead of being denied outright
964209488101130240 2018-02-15 18:47:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @MarketUrbanism since there are specific time clocks on the CONH process and DOB and HPD are supposedly committed to making this work
964208997208178688 2018-02-15 18:45:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @MarketUrbanism the idea is that it will be expedited compared to the SRO CONH process
964208631267803136 2018-02-15 18:43:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy if you have not harassed tenants, it is not that hard. HPD essentially does a 45-day investigation and then decides whether or not you get it. if they're not sure, they kick it to an administrative trial judge (OATH) and there is a hearing. http://bradlander.nyc/CONH
964207419852247041 2018-02-15 18:38:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> What's interesting is that this will be one of the first neighborhoods where many renters will be protected by the new certificate of no harassment program, which requires landlords to prove they haven't harassed tenants in order to get building permits
964204300825124864 2018-02-15 18:26:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Meanwhile, there is this story in WSJ about a slight increase in Bronx home prices that begins "The Bronx is the new Brooklyn. Sort of." I am very tired.https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-bronx-is-back-baby-1518606000
964202228855779328 2018-02-15 18:18:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> "The citys not offering anything. Theyre going the same route as Willets Point. But theyre using a rezoning instead of eminent domainWhen the Bronx was burned down, these [business owners] built Jerome out of the ashes."https://commercialobserver.com/2018/02/a-massive-rezoning-promises-to-remake-the-central-bronx/
964185052316827649 2018-02-15 17:10:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> I did a deep dive into the rezoning of Jerome Avenue in the Bronx, which is sparking fears of displacement among hundreds of small, immigrant-owned businesses and thousands of tenants. But it could also produce 4000 units of housing https://commercialobserver.com/2018/02/a-massive-rezoning-promises-to-remake-the-central-bronx/

963185775683784704 2018-02-12 22:59:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @Maxtropolitan now you're being rude
963183651860205568 2018-02-12 22:50:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @Maxtropolitan you assess value based on what the artist gets paid for comparable mural work
963183354454691840 2018-02-12 22:49:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @Maxtropolitan @MarketUrbanism potentially not getting the wall is always part of the negotiation for a host of reasons. the more likely reason owners veto is bc they want full control over the design
963182755872956416 2018-02-12 22:47:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @Maxtropolitan @MarketUrbanism artists who want some measure of control over what happens to their work
963182409700331520 2018-02-12 22:45:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @Maxtropolitan lol it doesn't really imply or state that you should buff immediately. but it does reinforce artists right to sue if you do, under VARA. but you should read the ruling rather than arguing with wasting my time!
963181517542391809 2018-02-12 22:42:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tony_damiano i'm upset
963181293994500101 2018-02-12 22:41:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @Maxtropolitan lol come the fuck on
963181210863329280 2018-02-12 22:41:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @Maxtropolitan no. they allowed the artists to paint there. if they had buffed it, the artists still could have sued them even before the demolition
963180984308064263 2018-02-12 22:40:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also offensive: an 18 percent cut to HUD's budget but the creation of...whatever these arepic.twitter.com/REKL07trxZ

963174702918221825 2018-02-12 22:15:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @Maxtropolitan i think it's only appropriate that owners should know they can be held responsible for destroying tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of art
963173858802065411 2018-02-12 22:11:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @Maxtropolitan since they did, in fact, recklessly paint over hundreds of murals rather than give the artists time to figure it out
963173697917018112 2018-02-12 22:11:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @Maxtropolitan it sends the opposite message re: the first thing. the second thing, yes it would strongly suggest that property owners consider VARA and have a contract delineating who has rights to the work

959474041827549184 2018-02-02 17:10:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism that is an interesting question. i'll ask wiley but i feel like no??

959192351859183617 2018-02-01 22:30:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mattzollerseitz @nandelabra very common on high-rent retail corridors (times square, 5th ave, soho), especially if the previous tenant was paying market-rate anyway and the landlord is looking for someone who will pay even more
959192052826329089 2018-02-01 22:29:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mattzollerseitz @nandelabra warehousing storefronts is very common. if the landlord is holding out for a specific retail rent, they make the calculation of how long the storefront can be vacant before they start to lose money.

958796005176201217 2018-01-31 20:15:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dwachsmuth hi david - to what extent does the report's source of fundingthe Hotel Trades Councilimpact your findings?
958794645416415232 2018-01-31 20:10:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sethmpk i saw. i guess like i would like to take it at face value but also this is a pretty fierce lobbying war so i'm having a hard time doing so
958792358954487809 2018-01-31 20:01:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sethmpk worth noting that this study was funded by the hotel trades council, which is the main lobbying group opposing Airbnb in NYC

958538828280664064 2018-01-30 03:14:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale he was using it to talk about family sponsorship. clearly he fundamentally misunderstands how family sponsorship currently works or is willfully lying to pander to his base.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/us/politics/the-facts-behind-the-weaponized-phrase-chain-migration.html

958015085024370693 2018-01-29 16:32:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Actually, NYCHA has $25 billion in unmet capital needs, per @SallyGold.   Anyway the NYDN story bothered me bc it focuses on the developers but fails to mention that NYCHA is doing this to plug a budget hole created by significant cuts in federal funding over time
958014170561163266 2018-01-29 16:29:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @cbcny @NYCHA @SallyGold oh i forgot about this story!! right
958013476521283584 2018-01-29 16:26:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold is it? i don't doubt that they've said that but even the press release Greg's story is based on says $17B, so idk
958011945134804994 2018-01-29 16:20:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is a good story, but (1) 50% affordable doesn't isn't 'luxury' and (2) no story about NextGen NYCHA is complete w/o a discussion of the fact that the agency has $17 BILLION in unmet capital needs for building repairs

957714702829850624 2018-01-28 20:39:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TanaGaneva @Jesse_Hirsch I think campaigning on expanding the HUD budget/vouchers/upping public housing funding would be a big deal. But it might take someone pretty socialist-leaning to do it
957713637237510147 2018-01-28 20:34:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TanaGaneva @Jesse_Hirsch Housing is expensive to build and its hard to legislate construction on a federal level, except to provide funding or vouchers. However the feds could play a much more active role in pushing states to build, like they did after WWII
957511280004337664 2018-01-27 07:10:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> Philosophy night at the library...is surprisingly good

957408383157637121 2018-01-27 00:22:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> It would be so great if essays like this included ways that gentrifiers could engage with problems like displacement/landlord abuse/lack of affordable housing instead of reflecting on complaints about Whole Foods and chopped cheese
957387030559907840 2018-01-27 22:57:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro I get the theft of pride thing, not the poverty is an endless resource thing
957386806001053696 2018-01-27 22:56:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> Peoples tendency to direct their ire at gentrifier businesses rather than the actual market forces involved in gentrification can seem silly....and so what? I could also live without yet another essay recounting the origin of the word gentrification
957384586291531776 2018-01-27 22:47:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> Underwhelmed by this NYT Mag essay on gentrificationhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/magazine/when-gentrification-isnt-about-housing.html?smid=tw-nytmag&smtyp=cur&referer=https://t.co/z1x1olJTjT?amp=1

956933762801131520 2018-01-26 16:56:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TamingofdeSchuh what i'm hearing is 'becca decides who is of note'
956933320318865411 2018-01-26 16:54:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TamingofdeSchuh but who is really 'of note'
956915778669940736 2018-01-26 15:44:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lpafridi technically, as nathan tells me in the responses to my tweet, the main grain storage warehouse has not been demolished but all of the other connected bldgs have been. but probably just a matter of time till it too is knocked down
956915171020169218 2018-01-26 15:42:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lpafridi unclear! though i feel like given the state of that property (it is semi-falling into the canal) and the location right on the canal/in kind of a no-man's land, i think it will remain M-zoned for now
956679520295309314 2018-01-25 00:05:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KensingerNathan Oh I'm glad it still lives!! I saw the construction walls up a few months ago but I didn't know if they were doing full demo or what

956559229728579584 2018-01-25 16:07:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vinbarone @2AvSagas though i think certain kinds of policy committees in city council are less likely  to be provincial - i.e. land use, NYCHA, housing/buildings - bc they usually focus on one or two geographically specific projects at a time
956558707994841093 2018-01-25 16:05:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @vinbarone lmao true

955972347193896961 2018-01-23 01:15:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Charles Komanoff noted that the 400-pound-gorilla in the room wasnt the handful of outer borough drivers whod be mad but the people who argue that the MTA is already so wasteful and corrupt that it will waste any additional revenue raised through congestion pricing
955971523097047040 2018-01-23 01:12:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> Wylde also joked that the 12 guys from Queens who held the press conference opposing congestion pricing were the same 12 guys who opposed it under Bloomberg 10 years ago
955970915623370752 2018-01-23 01:10:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> Lol I just got out of the panel on congestion pricing and a random guy on the elevator tried to argue with me about it. Even on the weekend? he asked
955967550713720832 2018-01-23 00:56:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> The panel also agrees on the need for a dynamic congestion pricing plan that is higher during rush hour/daylight hours and lower in the middle of the night
955967278637551621 2018-01-23 00:55:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also Kathryn Wylde of the Partnership for NYC spent some time advocating for a value capture/property tax plan to raise money for the MTA: Were never going to be able to tax or toll our way through this if we dont try to tax the economic benefits of transit.
955966781188968455 2018-01-23 00:53:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> Not surprisingly, the Uber guy on this congestion pricing panel wants all FHVs to be taxed at the same rate

953372056808230917 2018-01-16 21:03:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> so few places left that welcome new young freelancers with open arms

953009957913456640 2018-01-15 21:04:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i mean that sucks but also sounds like they came to the CB to ask for a full liquor license without really getting support from the neighbors, which is a mistake
953008918531395584 2018-01-15 21:00:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas what does the sale of the building have to do with the CB?

952294100446871552 2018-01-13 21:39:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @brooklyn11211 Right but I assume thats based on the previous reporting...I also feel like this lot got an individual rezoning? anyway we will find out soon one way or the other
952293080346103813 2018-01-13 21:35:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @brooklyn11211 Oh I forgot about that. Hopefully they floodproofed!

952291942704001025 2018-01-13 21:31:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @brooklyn11211 I actually dont think so? From everything Ive read/know its all market-rate condos and rentals

952253151498948609 2018-01-13 18:56:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Moira Donegan's piece from last April on Rebecca Solnit and the 'consciousness-raising' women's groups of the 60s and 70s is extremely good.

951910741673697280 2018-01-12 20:16:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> Another NYT piece about a publisher leaving NYC in the early '80s, featuring Ed Koch saying they weren't giving the city "the real story" about why they were leaving  http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/nyregion/harcourt-brace-moving-from-the-city.htmlpic.twitter.com/BlaN03PJ9J

951903848641286144 2018-01-12 19:48:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> I incorporated this into a post about Simon & Schuster renewing its lease in Rockefeller Center...the Times story linked below is about its original lease in 1976, when the financial crisis/crime/etc were driving some firms away from NYC  https://commercialobserver.com/2018/01/simon-schuster-stays-put-at-rockefeller-center/https://twitter.com/thecitywanderer/status/951894883442331648

951894883442331648 2018-01-12 19:13:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> Reading old real estate coverage is fascinating because the Times spent a lot of time writing around why companies wanted to leave New York in the '70s.

951308945901187072 2018-01-10 04:25:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz you're right. yeah i mean clearly the Times didn't "obtain" all of the emails involved, they only had the ones involving the fact checker. what's weird is that if they knew MD was the creator of the list, why they didn't ask her what happened...

951241562666741760 2018-01-10 23:57:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @uhshanti Also a project I covered extensively, wrote a long feature on recently, FOILed hundreds of pages of docs on
951240982460358656 2018-01-10 23:54:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @uhshanti Keep a close eye on Jerome Avenue in the Bronx. East New York was a political screwup in some ways. The process with Jerome has been a lot slower and more deliberate, and the market in those neighborhoods is cheaper than central/east Brooklyn
951240084099141633 2018-01-10 23:51:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @uhshanti If youre going to use NYC examples, I wouldnt say East New York is one where gentrification has already occurred. However I live close by in Crown Heights, much of which is rather tightly zoned, and the gentrification/displacement has been dramatic
951238137073799168 2018-01-10 23:43:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @uhshanti I covered the East New York rezoning lol but thank you

951180686106546176 2018-01-10 19:55:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> Aetna has apparently pulled out of its lease at Vornado's under-construction 61 Ninth Avenue building in Meatpacking. And the mayor's office has cancelled a $9.6M incentive package for Aetna, according to @joeanutahttp://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180110/REAL_ESTATE/180119992/city-nixes-incentive-package-for-aetna-headquarters-move#utm_medium=email&utm_source=cnyb-realestate&utm_campaign=cnyb-realestate-20180110

950416124579065856 2018-01-08 17:17:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat I liked having all of us do different hoods so we didn't end up having to fight over who would cover a handful of stories but i could see the advantage of forcing everyone to dig in and find different stuff in one neighborhood

950410379779330049 2018-01-08 16:54:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat so i took a beat reporting class at NYU and the prof basically took the DNAinfo model and had us each choose a different neighborhood to cover. each week or two we had to cover a different kind of story in our neighborhood. it was awesome and that way you can teach what you know!

(see 375 pearl: https://benbansal.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/verizon02.jpg) i suspect NSA just took advantage of the infrastructure that's there and the building happens to be horrible looking.

948980372137828352 2018-01-04 18:12:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin in the eyes of the city you are culpable as a landlord if you continue to fail to prevent illegal short-term rentals. in some cases individual tenants are sued but even OSE admits that's incredibly rare

948979351172808704 2018-01-04 18:08:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin it's complex which is why i wrote a longer story about the lawsuit last year. in some cases, he claims he was unaware his tenants were doing so. in other cases, he had contracted with companies that specialize in "30-day-plus rentals" that then in fact rented shorter term

948686701374918656 2018-01-03 22:45:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @avitale @dahvnyc @ShelleyElwood @mumblerant however saying it became an 'urban problem' only in the 80s is not particularly helpful
948686520738893824 2018-01-03 22:44:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @avitale @dahvnyc @ShelleyElwood @mumblerant just fwiw new york city experienced a significant uptick in homelessness in the early 80s which coincided with the shutdown/demolition/elimination of many of the city's SROs
948664722899062784 2018-01-03 21:17:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TamingofdeSchuh the only rule i have when i bring someone new home is that they cannot give me shit about my apartment
948664298028625923 2018-01-03 21:16:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TamingofdeSchuh mine is neither gigantic nor has in unit laundry but it's cheap and close to everything in crown heights, as well as all the trains. it's a two bedroom so i'm fine with it

948652132483436544 2018-01-03 20:27:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexYablon are you here to tell us you're an RC airplane enthusiast
948649443997503488 2018-01-03 20:17:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> Apparently he's talking about Gateway National Recreation Area (and Floyd Bennett Field??) on Jamaica Bay
948648033599868933 2018-01-03 20:11:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katiebrenzel ahhh thanks
948644930020429824 2018-01-03 19:59:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon also ????https://twitter.com/thecitywanderer/status/948644240204189696
948644451823517697 2018-01-03 19:57:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> Did I miss some memo on the state's 400 acres of vacant property in Brooklyn?
948644240204189696 2018-01-03 19:56:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> Literally where is this happeninghttps://twitter.com/GloriaPazmino/status/948643296632598528
948643677806710784 2018-01-03 19:54:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @johnbonazzo paid for by the New York Power Authority, obviously
948643431580164096 2018-01-03 19:53:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> Hard to see how the gov could justify the probably wild cost of this tunnel when the subway system and commuter rail need billions in investmenthttps://twitter.com/thecitywanderer/status/948642644166668288
948642644166668288 2018-01-03 19:50:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> So Cuomo suggests there should be a car tunnel from Long Island to Westchester. "It would be invisible"
948638538672812033 2018-01-03 19:33:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> Cuomo on the GOP tax legislation: "No state contributes more to the federal government and gets back less than New York State. Washingtons tax plan now uses New York as a piggy bank to finance tax cuts to low-tax states."
948637522925703169 2018-01-03 19:29:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> "Santa Claus did not visit the state capitol this year," sez Cuomo, who says funding "must be provided" for subway system he controls, and "cheap political slogans" haven't helped
948636713940914176 2018-01-03 19:26:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> Cuomo is framing both cashless tolling and the Penn Station redevelopment as important for New York's security
948635770486771713 2018-01-03 19:22:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> He also spent a while shouting out the labor unions, which are significant donors to his campaign
948635378000498688 2018-01-03 19:21:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also to close the LLC loophole, another big ethics/campaign spending reform issue
948633716347285507 2018-01-03 19:14:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> Cuomo is pledging to ban outside income for state legislators, which is at the top of the list for state ethics reform advocates
948632692874207232 2018-01-03 19:10:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> Cuomo just said 'I'm old enough to remember when there were no homeless people on the streets' ?????
948626153136410630 2018-01-03 18:44:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Oh no he's speaking spanish
948624607644471296 2018-01-03 18:38:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> Minute 37 of the State of the State address livestream and Cuomo is FINALLY talking
948623333490294784 2018-01-03 18:33:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danarubinstein god how long is this
948620314031874048 2018-01-03 18:21:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon ahahaha well he claims it was an actual box factory

948373321791492096 2018-01-02 01:59:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @DanielKayHertz So theyre just vacant land then?
948373018560073728 2018-01-02 01:58:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @DanielKayHertz Right. I guess I was confused about the big holes and the date of the photo- are those present day or have they been redeveloped?
948372167447711744 2018-01-02 01:55:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ungarino Also honestly we have a lot of nice street seating near my office and that probably would have been fine if it werent like 15 degrees and windy
948371905102348297 2018-01-02 01:54:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ungarino I think curbed did one too! But I dont really like crying in public which is usually what these are based on
948370888415694848 2018-01-02 01:50:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @DanielKayHertz Is all that open space in the middle now parkland?

948369590244999168 2018-01-02 01:45:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> If someone were to create some kind of guide to private or semi-private places to have a meltdown in various parts of Manhattan tbh it would be excellent service journalism
948369287961567232 2018-01-02 01:43:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> I ran out of work at 4 pm to cry and I learned that there is literally no place private in FiDi

948340043768266752 2018-01-02 23:47:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schadenfraade @DavidKlion Yeah but in fairness we might as well serve much more dense and needy neighborhoods first if were building new subway lines
948331379280044032 2018-01-02 23:13:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj @kittertwitty @alon_levy i believe technically someone else outed her

948325992732479488 2018-01-02 22:51:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj @kittertwitty @alon_levy she went to jail because she wouldn't identify Valerie Plame. but she is probably better known for misreporting the 'weapons of mass destruction' that formed the basis of the iraq invasion

940988568750747648 2017-12-13 16:55:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emma_a_whitford @Rizak11 i didn't go to the mayor's presser in the bronx but my sense is essentially the longer-term clusters were basically omitted from this speech/announcement, as Emma points out
940984989629534209 2017-12-13 16:41:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ScottRechler @danrivoli so did rechler suggest they should do some kind of value capture for ESA or third track?

940981559473078272 2017-12-13 16:27:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism right, but the point is to convert the cluster sites to traditional RS housing. if they cannot convert the cluster sites the whole thing is moot from a political perspective
940980998099128322 2017-12-13 16:25:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @oscarthinks i'm not sure what this has to do with 421a. if anything, a connection could be drawn to J-51....my point remains that eminent domain is very expensive and i hope the city has money set aside for that
940979584518025221 2017-12-13 16:19:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> And @emma_a_whitford made the important point that this move does not totally eliminate clusters in the near-termhttps://twitter.com/emma_a_whitford/status/940599087023448065
940979355093819392 2017-12-13 16:18:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> And while this is paywalled, I assume that the RSA is talking about mounting a legal challenge on that basispic.twitter.com/4jBHKvOCVu
940978633727987715 2017-12-13 16:16:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> Honestly this BdB plan for cluster sites is pretty good but seizing buildings thru eminent domain is going to be wild, time consuming and expensivehttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/nyregion/homeless-shelter-cluster-nyc-de-blasio.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&smtyp=cur&_r=0

939961650949623808 2017-12-10 20:54:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @surlyurbanist DC is an interesting case bc it has had black city governments but it has also been deeply mismanaged, and the city itself lacks real financial control over its own budget, and now it is so expensive that for the first time in decades it's no longer majority black

935889722932637698 2017-11-29 15:14:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> I continue to be the most lazily dressed person at real estate events
935767341836722176 2017-11-28 07:08:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sethmpk The good kind or the bad kind?

935738394319220738 2017-11-28 05:13:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder i recently got lost on my bike in chinatown with a dead phone and i ended up consulting an old irish tourist couple with a paper map
935738066555363328 2017-11-28 05:11:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder also my most recent phone died constantly anyway so i got more used to pretending i didn't have it at all
935737617009795077 2017-11-28 05:10:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder i probably would kind of but at least here i know NYC well enough that i can get by without it in a lot of places. also i lived here before i had an iphone and i used to just write shit down from google maps lol
935737055245733890 2017-11-28 05:07:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder well, except twitter isn't working well already so we'll see lol

935736470257782784 2017-11-28 05:05:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder spending $1000 on an easily breakable iphone is unconscionable IMO
935736373688111105 2017-11-28 05:05:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder what do you have now
935736312447062016 2017-11-28 05:04:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> the app shortcut thing at the bottom of the text message pane is bad and i want to figure out how to get rid of it
935736119337119745 2017-11-28 05:04:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder omg get the flip phone
935735643367493633 2017-11-28 05:02:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just got an iPhone 8 after a barely functional iPhone 5 and I'm discovering all the weird unnecessary garbage features they added to this iOS

935627655231262720 2017-11-28 21:53:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism as folks in the article point out, getting an artist to sign a waiver is an easy way to avoid this

935608891513167872 2017-11-28 20:38:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dahvnyc lol i really need to go to the transit center for one of those events these days, considering they're 10 floors above me
935588564125011973 2017-11-28 19:17:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amyharvard_ lmao the fact that tyson's actually has one of those now is a novelty to me

935574323800178693 2017-11-28 18:21:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion @JacobGarchik YES i forgot about that, also in 300 ashland. that will be a big deal
935573066243100672 2017-11-28 18:16:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion lol there's a citibank inside there so i'm happy. and inexplicably there are two dunkin donuts but zero drug stores or any kind of casual grab and go convenience thing...
935572422471938049 2017-11-28 18:13:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion now we need a duane reade or something over there. c'mon forest city ratner!!
935572183509864449 2017-11-28 18:12:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion honestly this is huge. it is a significant convenience for the tens of thousands of commuters who pass through atlantic every day from all parts of BK. much easier than going to manhattan (or god forbid, williamsburg)
935570306491699201 2017-11-28 18:05:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts which part?

935239550800154625 2017-11-27 20:10:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart Lol the NYC ones were wild and very long. There was one where a group glued their hands together and had to be hauled out

934868555954294784 2017-11-26 19:36:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i'm not sure high-priced "affordable" housing substantially differs from what would be market-rate in ENY in this case, the only difference is that the former is underpinned by those subsidized units.  & every big dev't built there will prob include retail plus community facility
934867686827462656 2017-11-26 19:33:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes that guy in your mentions is right - they should have a map so they can show the rezoning area
934867457776541697 2017-11-26 19:32:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism at least there are nice pics? lol
934623142978482176 2017-11-25 03:21:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder if we ever needed a real public editor, now is the time
934595546731474944 2017-11-25 01:31:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen Glad I'm not crazy. It's weird!
934595329252646912 2017-11-25 01:31:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Are they running Cuomo trains on the E line? I just saw one with blue and yellow paint all over it
934567883493068800 2017-11-25 23:42:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair Lmao I mean Stephen is on it usually
934558770100887552 2017-11-25 23:05:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is an amazing first sentence on any given day, but it feels particularly relevant todaypic.twitter.com/t7XNPpyQDC
934185421969510404 2017-11-24 22:22:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> Weird riding the D.C. Red Line with the new trains because it's almost like riding a transit system from the 21st century, not the 70s. Then another one of the shitty carpeted trains comes and I'm like oh lol never mind
933475802280316929 2017-11-22 23:22:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty Lame! Thanks

933435346582425605 2017-11-22 20:41:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro i don't know the building so i can't say for sure but yes probably because of a tax abatement
933178186178973696 2017-11-21 03:39:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nycfuture @sethmpk also going to flag @MC_NYC altho i think this was before his time
933178030540951553 2017-11-21 03:39:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nycfuture @sethmpk i guess the question is do we need private actors to step in where states are unwilling or unable to fund decent educational programs in prisons?
933174878684954624 2017-11-21 03:26:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @artichoko agree, they are prohibitively expensive and the free ones are not as easy to come by as they should be
933153509075234816 2017-11-21 02:01:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jenna_Maroney_ yes, that too. it would definitely also need to include discussion of birth control because a lot of men clearly have a poor understanding of how it works
933153176873816065 2017-11-21 02:00:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EmmaSaltzberg that is awesome!!!! and there are other things like this but they're very small and self-selecting. also i would love to be involved if they want help
933151226082025472 2017-11-21 01:52:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is a serious public health issue and doctors and older folks telling millennials to simply sleep with fewer people is NOT an adequate or acceptable answer
933150817183465472 2017-11-21 01:51:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Many, many people don't seem to know how to talk about their STI status, how to react when someone discloses to them, how often they should be tested, and what condoms do and don't protect you from.
933150242593300480 2017-11-21 01:48:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Women and gay men should not have to shoulder the burden of education and regular testing themselves simply because they are at higher risk of infection for many STIs
933145635934662656 2017-11-21 01:30:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> Starting to wonder if there should be some kind of adult sex ed - particularly for straight men but we all need it - to help educate people about STIs and sexual health
933115732639936512 2017-11-21 23:31:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MoCADA @cmlauriecumbo @CHTenantUnion BAM South is not part of Atlantic Yards
933105118072864768 2017-11-21 22:49:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism \_()_/
933104732914139137 2017-11-21 22:47:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism well as the above links seem to indicate, ACORN stood to benefit under the original community benefit agreement with Ratner and he maybe also loaned them money??
933104286497611777 2017-11-21 22:46:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism if ACORN is considered the predecessor to NYCC it's not really weird that she's been involved in opposing the armory
933103720023429120 2017-11-21 22:43:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, Cumbo's ACORN-Atlantic Yards callout to Bertha Lewis took me down a very weird and corrupt-seeming rabbit hole https://nypost.com/2009/09/21/group-can-core-on-atl-yards/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2010/04/acorns_bertha_lewis_goes_a_lit.html
933103513571418112 2017-11-21 22:43:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> Not sure why it took the city so long to come up with $50 million for affordable housing at the armory, but at least the project is finally moving forwardhttps://commercialobserver.com/2017/11/bedford-union-armory-gains-more-affordable-housing-and-wins-key-council-vote/

933084358885498886 2017-11-21 21:27:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SaraMorrison @annamerlan oh come on
933083900330561536 2017-11-21 21:25:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @keller_jd not much though
933083833758568455 2017-11-21 21:24:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brianrtw right, which I gather is the thinking behind the CDC recommendation that people shouldn't be tested unless they're symptomatic (which is fucked up, IMO, since many people are spreading it and are asymptomatic)
933073210773524481 2017-11-21 20:42:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HarronWawker @brianrtw sure, but you don't need symptoms to get the IGG blood tests for HSV1 and 2
933062511112474626 2017-11-21 20:00:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caitlinrcruz @HarronWawker @alon_levy how long did it take to get your results?
933061393913401346 2017-11-21 19:55:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caitlinrcruz @HarronWawker is it easy to get the full battery of tests for free? i'm sure planned parenthood will do it if you qualify earnings-wise, and the public health clinics will do them for free if you're willing to wait... i'm not sure where else.
933060108086595584 2017-11-21 19:50:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HarronWawker AND a lot of men i suspect are (1) not getting tested for herpes at all (bc many providers still do not test for it by default) and (2) unsuspectingly spreading it bc they are symptomatic and don't know what it is, or are asymptomatic and have no idea
933059716758065153 2017-11-21 19:49:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HarronWawker also a lot of people don't seem to realize that condoms do not totally protect you from skin-to-skin contact STIs like herpes and HPV
933059395382112258 2017-11-21 19:47:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HarronWawker i think as a cis woman you have stronger incentives to get tested regularly because let's face it, you're more likely to be symptomatic (for STIs) than your cis male partners and you're constantly worrying about minor-seeming things that could fuck up your vaginal health
933058824436633600 2017-11-21 19:45:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HarronWawker you know, i think about this a lot when i talk to men. a lot of them either don't get tested as often as they should, or if they do, they seem to lack basic knowledge of sexual health and STIs.

932692062520168451 2017-11-20 19:28:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexCKaufman no, i don't think it'll happen. and yeah actually @ChristRobbins has done some good stuff at the Voice. https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/11/14/let-a-thousand-streetcars-bloom/https://www.villagevoice.com/2016/09/13/gentrified-aquarium-de-blasios-streetcar-and-the-tale-of-two-waterfronts/
932690349797060608 2017-11-20 19:21:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexCKaufman BQX would be v expensive compared to the more reasonable options of creating dedicated bus lanes or SBS lines. its public review process would be long and involved. it's also a very clear real estate play whose main backers are developers
932689862720983043 2017-11-20 19:19:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexCKaufman the BQX is dumb and the concept of tax increase value capture is dumb and not that well-supported, as they point out. i don't know if BQX would "cause" gentrification as much as it would benefit from whatever is already happening...
932688701137747968 2017-11-20 19:14:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson and even if they are not billed directly for it, i can guarantee you it would be built into any rent increase
932688604178141185 2017-11-20 19:14:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson the tenant usually pays the tax, but it depends on the lease structure
932688234701828097 2017-11-20 19:12:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexCKaufman i think it's lame for the Times to quote "Here is New York" in a lede in 2017 but i agree that the CRT needs to go or that at least the threshold at which businesses get taxed should be raised substantially

932666018434084865 2017-11-20 17:44:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYCPlanning @mattyglesias @MarketUrbanism exactly yes
932665637951889408 2017-11-20 17:43:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYCPlanning @mattyglesias @MarketUrbanism yes. so they want that to be preserved under the new text amendment, and be able to build on lots smaller than 50K-sf without having to include manufacturing space
932664767185129472 2017-11-20 17:39:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYCPlanning @mattyglesias @MarketUrbanism yes, they want increases in FAR and they want as of right development on lots smaller than 50K sf. above 50K sf they want a FAR increase in order to develop manufacturing space
932663822975930368 2017-11-20 17:35:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYCPlanning @mattyglesias @MarketUrbanism are you watching this hearing? it's actually pretty interesting. the self storage execs claim they want to develop industrial space within their buildings; they just need it to pencil out in terms of square footage/FAR

931990831577419776 2017-11-18 21:01:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KeldonB @tak_yon @aarmlovi and actually people who are stabilized are usually the most fearful of rising rents and of losing their homes. they remain vulnerable to displacement and don't have confidence in the city to enforce tenant protection laws properly
931990304835690498 2017-11-18 20:59:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KeldonB @tak_yon @aarmlovi you do understand that i have heard this argument for years, right? i don't need it explained to me.   also neither rent stabilization nor control prevents your rent from increasing. RS rents generally increase by legally mandated amounts each year
931989274869878785 2017-11-18 20:55:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KeldonB @tak_yon @aarmlovi stabilization is not what makes people "not care" about supply. i think that's a misconception
931986838700679168 2017-11-18 20:45:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KeldonB @tak_yon @aarmlovi i mean that's not exactly what the thread is about but sort of. i would keep in mind also that i write about this for a living and the people who are debating with me in the mentions do not
931984862394896389 2017-11-18 20:38:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> Last night, a friend texted me: "I don't think a guy has to be a serial rapist or harasser to be a threat." Isn't it weird and awful that we have to explain that??
931924532427882496 2017-11-18 16:38:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @curcuas honestly i disagree. i cover housing here for a living
931921948958953475 2017-11-18 16:28:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @YIMBYwiki @alon_levy also, alon, ownership arguably has the same effect
931920057759928320 2017-11-18 16:20:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MichaelCorleyNY @frimframmed yes. which is why i called them RS apartments. but the minneapolis story calls it "rent control" even though i'm pretty sure they mean rent stabilization
931919298863489025 2017-11-18 16:17:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nathantempey did not! that is interesting
931757863395094528 2017-11-17 05:36:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MichaelCorleyNY people don't seem to understand the difference between variances and rezonings. if you need a rezoning then yes you are subject to MIH
931757421747458048 2017-11-17 05:34:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy correlation does not equal causation
931757222618689536 2017-11-17 05:33:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy IMO rent control =/= NIMBYs.
931757143266594816 2017-11-17 05:33:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy rich white NIMBY people are everywhere alon, including many many places without rent control.
931756722687037440 2017-11-17 05:31:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy kind of but there are obviously larger issues at play than just rent control in new york. i think even without rent control we'd still be incredibly densely populated and have very little available land
931755907628879872 2017-11-17 05:28:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy that doesn't make rent control an inherent negative....
931755531458539521 2017-11-17 05:26:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MichaelCorleyNY yes, the first statement is accurate, but MIH now requires "permanent affordability" that would technically over-rule the 421-a time limits. and in general RS units become market-rate only when they exceed the current legal rent regulation threshold
931748287459274752 2017-11-17 04:57:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz elaborate?
931747083882778625 2017-11-17 04:53:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you don't realize that stabilization can be paired with more modern/dense zoning, you evidently aren't familiar with how development works in New York City these days. & the idea that these kind of housing policy changes somehow can't be paired with RS is a bit misinformed
931743039105781760 2017-11-17 04:37:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> But I do have a beef with this passage, which implies that these issues are somehow totally separate from rent control and don't help tenants? Especially something like legalizing ADUs, which is an issue that puts 1000s of NYC tenants at risk of evictionpic.twitter.com/qIsr1N8lGf

930922647843753984 2017-11-15 22:17:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder @TribTowerViews @woolie i mean this also mostly ignores the history of RC in New York City, which I am pretty sure was the first to institute it nationwide
930922173501530112 2017-11-15 22:15:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder @TribTowerViews @woolie honestly that feels like an oversight rather than an intentional omission since it's in the lede. a good editor would have caught that

930917694672658432 2017-11-15 21:57:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder the idea that it would all be built and financed by the gov't in some fashion, typically by seizing wealth/property from the wealthy
930917331366285313 2017-11-15 21:56:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder "the government should seize land and built and manage massive amounts of high-density housing paid for by a wealth tax" is some version of what most of them want

930832560774615045 2017-11-15 16:19:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy the barriers to entry often involve status, class and connections. going to a good college>being able to do unpaid/low-paying internships>getting a prestigious job
930831631849545730 2017-11-15 16:15:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy unfortunately
930831583061467136 2017-11-15 16:15:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy people do them because that's how you get a real job in a lot of fields
930831455231643649 2017-11-15 16:14:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy they choose to pay because that's a competitive labor market. jobs that have a lower barrier to entry/require fewer specialized skills (journalism, fashion, etc) see workers as disposable so they often don't feel the need to pay interns
930830223716831232 2017-11-15 16:09:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy it's because of our shitty labor laws, which distinguish training/skill gathering that can fall under interships (and therefore be unpaid) from normal paid work

930806871967109120 2017-11-15 14:37:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet not to housing lol
930806761124171776 2017-11-15 14:36:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, more than just millennials having different spending habitsa lot of chains, particularly department stores, offered a shitty experience and (it turns out) can't survive a more competitive retail environment. You can no longer just throw up stores and have people come
930805920354963457 2017-11-15 14:33:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @muelleratx what do you mean
930805862779715584 2017-11-15 14:33:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Bloomberg also got to the heart of the matter, which I like. Many chains are facing bankruptcy bc they're very over-leveraged and owe huge amounts of debt to their suppliers and bankspic.twitter.com/bXU0ObWou0
930805207751102465 2017-11-15 14:30:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet Yes! We want to do more reporting on that. the delinquencies etc.
930800895947833344 2017-11-15 14:13:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> Honestly, consumer spending and confidence is up and people still love to buy shitjust not in store as much.
930800644713168896 2017-11-15 14:12:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMartinezNYC can confirm that they do not
930800424461963264 2017-11-15 14:11:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also on the topic of retail struggles, Bloomberg just released this amazing infographic feature about chain store closures and debthttps://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-retail-debt/

930641969533128704 2017-11-14 03:41:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @ceaweaver ugh this is involved what do you actually want to know. i can also send you the lease, at least as it appears in the FOIL request
930641259479347200 2017-11-14 03:39:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism good lord, yes
930641092676149251 2017-11-14 03:38:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism no, it will be leased! the condo portion will be sold upfront to the developers. we had this discussion already
930640765319081984 2017-11-14 03:37:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i think the idea that the condo portion of the site would actually be sold was an equally pressing concern
930618201058299912 2017-11-14 02:07:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay rather than having multiple train lines on the same display line

930128735432597506 2017-11-13 17:42:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet yeah but as a woman that makes me feel kind of uncomfortable. i guess you're always being recorded anyway; they're just being more upfront this way and giving you access to the tape
930127873075240961 2017-11-13 17:39:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just what everyone wants, a mirror that records an eight-second video of you trying on clothes????

929826182287298560 2017-11-12 21:40:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter @Jesse_Hirsch and anything that's legitimately delicate you shouldn't be washing at the laundromat anyway
929826059524149249 2017-11-12 21:39:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter @Jesse_Hirsch whether you wash things on delicate or regular or whatever, the wash temp is a real thing! hotter water helps disinfect sheets/towels/underwear/socks (fwiw i often wash all those things together since they're all warm wash anyway/no reason to waste water)

929417702162223104 2017-11-11 18:37:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty i did the thing that they said i did but it did not follow the previous pattern of reporting re: my student loans, leading me to believe it was caused by a rule change from the trump admin loosening the protections that lenders have from student loan companies
929417014199939072 2017-11-11 18:34:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty credit scores are bullshit IMO and after this experience i firmly believe it

929415873672175616 2017-11-11 18:29:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader @WilliamTurton I also came to this exact realization yesterday, in this little threadhttps://twitter.com/thecitywanderer/status/929109024322281472
929403248989147138 2017-11-11 17:39:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> My credit score has gone up and down and back up again by like 200 points in the last six months after I was unfairly penalized by my student loan company!! Navient is a fucking mystery.

926217490736320513 2017-11-02 22:40:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> Who will do this kind of reporting now? And who will fund it?
926215336831135745 2017-11-02 22:31:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn Go to DNA or Gothamist's homepage and read what's posted
926213982280732673 2017-11-02 22:26:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> The local news landscape in NYC will be irrevocably damaged without basic accountability journalism, which is what DNA & Gothamist did
926212990738817024 2017-11-02 22:22:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> The folks at DNA & Gothamist have been my friends in the trenches & I am incredibly upset. NYC will be worse off without their reporting.

926096753509699585 2017-11-02 14:40:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @AudacityofPope however i'm pretty sure this is in the industrial zone so not a whole lot you can do here without a rezoning. it's an innovative use

925873117205094401 2017-11-01 23:52:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold but then her point wouldn't be as applicable to her constituents
925872823616368645 2017-11-01 23:50:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold like my point is it seems weird to compare single fam homes to each other rather than to large rental buildings which pay higher taxes
925872618787532806 2017-11-01 23:50:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold yes. there's the difference in tax rates between 1/2/3 fams and multi-fam rentals. and there is the issue with assessment across hoods

925871867352805377 2017-11-01 23:47:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> She keeps comparing the mayor's single family home to other single family homes rather than to multi-fam bldgs, which pay much higher taxes

925473049469702144 2017-10-31 21:22:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ethanklapper it seems more likely that he'd be prosecuted by Cy Vance's office

921176213888094208 2017-10-19 00:48:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nandelabra if writing about it was considered reckless, publishing it would be definitively so

921089275063619585 2017-10-19 19:02:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie i feel like they're not going to choose the bay area. too expensive and similar enough to seattle

920758655808626688 2017-10-18 21:09:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet they had to design these specially bc modular projects are never this tall

919949314712944640 2017-10-16 15:33:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Naparstek & as i note in the article from last year, the large amount of parking is required bc of the grocery store, which is a heavy parking use

917782264624373761 2017-10-10 16:01:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jeansgallo i didn't know there was a costco already there but i guess that's what's happening

917776627744075777 2017-10-10 15:39:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vinbarone you should post your mom's reviews of all transit improvements
917775355213156353 2017-10-10 15:34:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> I am watching a rather depressing city council hearing about how a proposed BJ's will destroy 17 acres of wetland on Staten Island
917766424961089538 2017-10-10 14:59:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb this headline turned out not to be very correct but i didn't really know at the timehttps://newyorkyimby.com/2015/05/city-council-approves-one-vanderbilt-and-midtown-east-rezoning.html

917764747541602304 2017-10-10 14:52:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericbrownzzz but i think it's more common for people to be placed in public schools in places where they have trouble attracting teachers
917764642180648960 2017-10-10 14:51:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericbrownzzz in NYC, there was a long-running hiring freeze in DOE schools, so my friend who did it worked in a charter school...
917764064377540608 2017-10-10 14:49:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericbrownzzz i don't think it would qualify as scabbing if you're working in charter schools? if you're being placed in a DOE school, i guess.
917763321352347648 2017-10-10 14:46:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericbrownzzz my best friend used to work for Teach for America, which is one of the orgs that has worked to legitimize this position...
917762081495056389 2017-10-10 14:41:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericbrownzzz many supposedly progressive orgs and politicians are in with the charter school lobby....
917761505554255872 2017-10-10 14:39:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@SallyGold wrote a good piece about why redeveloping the Pfizer sites in South Wburg is so controversialhttp://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/10/09/long-held-political-ethnic-rivalries-heating-up-fight-over-brooklyn-pfizer-site-114936

917754325795000320 2017-10-10 14:10:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro Hm but you might have to change your display name again (I'm a fan of the current one)
917753646359699456 2017-10-10 14:08:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb One Vanderbilt, which will have a FAR of 30, was rezoned first and served as a model for Midtown East rezoning in general
917731796657242112 2017-10-10 12:41:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb read the public review docs; it's easier than me explaining it here and they are detailed. https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/greater-east-midtown/greater-east-midtown.page https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/greater-east-midtown/presentation-cc-0620417.pdf
917723147822141442 2017-10-10 12:07:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb New zoning can get bonuses to get you beyond 15, as high as 30 in some cases
917721530834018304 2017-10-10 12:00:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @alexbaca Yes it is! I post screenshots once in a while but I'm not great about it. I also don't go through books very quickly because I work a lot

917515529249751040 2017-10-09 22:22:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold What actually is interesting about this is that it's right next to "The Hole"https://ny.curbed.com/2014/6/24/10084028/tour-the-hole-nycs-rundown-brooklyn-queens-border-town
917514483874004993 2017-10-09 22:17:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold i know! i'm just pointing out that this is very close to the border with queens and not really anywhere near the area that got rezoned
917507746064359424 2017-10-09 21:51:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> At least the blogs very kindly gave me credit
917505125253558272 2017-10-09 21:40:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne @johnasbury it is. but i could have had the correct info when my story ran 3 days ago, but the flack declined to comment, sent a release to NYT today

917483702241939456 2017-10-09 20:15:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @MarketUrbanism you're talking about the landmark air rights. they lowered the minimum psf to $61 but yes it's still not cheap.
917482743877038080 2017-10-09 20:11:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @devin_mb ugh this is so involved and i wrote so much about it. but no not exactly - the deals are worked out on an individual basis with the city
917481900154998784 2017-10-09 20:08:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @MarketUrbanism except for new midtown east rezoning, pretty sure plaza bonus still applies
917481688669786113 2017-10-09 20:07:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @devin_mb there is also a whole system of "bonuses" built into new midtown east zoning - paying for transit/street improvements, landmark air rights
917481372763279366 2017-10-09 20:06:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @devin_mb build a public plaza

917461259813117952 2017-10-09 18:46:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale i've never needed surgery to take them out because they're not impacted. so my dentist always said just let them come out on their own
917461109023629314 2017-10-09 18:45:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale it was just an extraction with novacaine. tooth erupted so they just take big clamps and pull it out. this is the second time i've done it
917457055404974080 2017-10-09 18:29:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK just the one pocket! didn't really mind last time i got a wisdom tooth pulled. i've never had them all out; this is 2nd one that's erupted
917456039729094657 2017-10-09 18:25:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK turned out pretty well but it's a little overpriced. this place https://www.servedbystadium.com/
917455690112827392 2017-10-09 18:24:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK i ordered it on friday (along with the rest of my coworkers) through this service that my office is trying out
917454644510674945 2017-10-09 18:20:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just had a salad/taco bowl for lunch that I ordered last week because I failed to plan for a giant hole in my mouth.

917421328969404417 2017-10-09 16:07:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SaraMorrison Damn. yeah i saw her tweet about it and it didn't totally answer the question
917420572295946240 2017-10-09 16:04:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Are you more likely to have you tweet added to a Twitter Moment if you're verified? Ugh

917390211390337024 2017-10-09 14:04:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just paid for a wisdom tooth extraction out of pocket because I didn't realize my dental insurance was an HMO! Adulthood is going great

917211497398497280 2017-10-08 02:13:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> "The Times then-culture editor...thought the story was unimportant, asking me why it mattered."

917205885268647936 2017-10-08 01:51:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> Corker always seemed so genteel; he clearly feels like he has nothing to lose and doesn't expect to salvage his relationship with Trump

917058575360495619 2017-10-08 16:06:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet high income brackets are set based on their ability to cross subsidize lower income units
917058331805700097 2017-10-08 16:05:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet AH is not a social welfare program. in expensive cities, it's designed to make development feasible, not just house the poor
917057453874991105 2017-10-08 16:01:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet why
917056163572801537 2017-10-08 15:56:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexCKaufman in general corker is a fairly predictable establishment R on pretty much everything. anti-abortion, pro-gun, anti-environment...
917052664227291139 2017-10-08 15:42:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet i checked, it's 120%

917050334350073856 2017-10-08 15:33:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC i guess so. there is some at via 57 that i qualify for but it's too $$. the projects in the bronx have more income bands and lower rents
917049008199266304 2017-10-08 15:28:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC the only open affordable housing i can afford right now is in the bronx
917047448291471361 2017-10-08 15:22:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ they do not

916896813499764736 2017-10-07 05:23:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYDailyNews @SallyGold @harrysiegel And NYCHA arguably should develop more of its property in $$ neighborhoods but it's more likely to encounter vocal opposition
916896331985227776 2017-10-07 05:21:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYDailyNews @SallyGold @harrysiegel It's mostly on the city side. Devs who know how to finance affordable are happy to do low income projects (even $$ ones) with big subsidies
916875549166927875 2017-10-07 03:59:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz lol
916875217968009216 2017-10-07 03:57:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz this reminds me of when we arm wrestled and you complained about carpal tunnel
916868592397897728 2017-10-07 03:31:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca @devin_mb this doesn't make me want to read ithttps://www.washingtonian.com/2017/06/28/derek-hyra-trouble-trouble-gentrification-cappuccino-city/
916867582694739968 2017-10-07 03:27:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca i also don't think i'd have the patience for this book

916866164311109632 2017-10-07 03:21:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca ugh alex you made me go through so many tweets to figure out what book this was
916857942099537921 2017-10-07 02:49:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYDailyNews @harrysiegel i do wonder if concerns about HUD funding are slowing down these deals, since city doesn't like to xfer property until financing is in place
916857206779400192 2017-10-07 02:46:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYDailyNews @harrysiegel and in fact some NYCHA lease deals were done under bloomberg, but the market bottomed out so they're only being built now
916856972791697408 2017-10-07 02:45:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYDailyNews @harrysiegel and yes i think it's exactly the same as bloomberg's plan, with more affordable housing.
916856108278566912 2017-10-07 02:41:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYDailyNews @harrysiegel when i interviewed NYCHA's head of real estate in august, she claimed they were in the midst of closing the first round of these deals

916838289281306624 2017-10-07 01:30:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism the developer still plans to build and still thinks it's viable

916836752484167680 2017-10-07 01:24:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism lol maybe one day they will actually rezone Empire.
916836298370973696 2017-10-07 01:23:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik seems unlikely. i also don't really see the city introducing height limits there but we'll see

916819930225500161 2017-10-07 00:17:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schadenfraade I have had a lot of Indian food in the city but for South Indian food, JC definitely seems like the spot.

916756097423339520 2017-10-07 20:04:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> Nice little exhibit on Johnson and Alfred Barr at NYU's grey art gallery if you're in the mood for architectural history
916752644798124032 2017-10-07 19:50:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> Then again if you know Johnson's work (or NYU's library), it's not terribly surprising that he was drawn to fascism
916751101344518144 2017-10-07 19:44:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> TIL Philip Johnson was a fascist (at one point)!

916022041278545920 2017-10-05 19:27:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism kind of, but he also touches on the advocates' arguments about not holding other devs accountable for affordable units
916021573861199872 2017-10-05 19:25:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i also don't understand why the mayor didn't discuss making the developer build more infrastructure
916021315735310337 2017-10-05 19:24:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i mean there are clearly a few different issues at play. (1) town not building affordable hsg in general and (2) blocking dev't of the site

915774714781536256 2017-10-04 03:04:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder If you had a parent who only had weekend custody/once a week dinner, no way around it really. When I was young we went to Chili's constantly

915767509395140608 2017-10-04 02:36:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism Not specified, but it says the requirement should be similar to what's in the special Clinton district in Hell's Kitchen

915754205708726272 2017-10-04 01:43:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism more low income housing, require CONH before developing, traffic studies, more daycare and schools
915753000173494272 2017-10-04 01:38:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes, you know they love to weigh in zoning these days

915741020813500417 2017-10-04 00:50:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katehinds @dmtrubman yes. i wish we could get more regular people in these kinds of meetings but the city is terrible at publicizing them

915740078693142528 2017-10-04 00:47:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katehinds and honestly the transpo reporters covering the multi-hour MTA meetings probably have it tougher!

915738491786612736 2017-10-04 00:40:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i mean both i guess. the rezoning will lead to displacement, affordable requirements not low enough, etc
915738329802559488 2017-10-04 00:40:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism the latter. MIH affordable requirements too high, no one in the community can afford it
915738164660187136 2017-10-04 00:39:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katehinds aha thanks. i actually like a lot of these public rezoning hearings, esp early in the process. it's the closest you get to real public input
915737589222641664 2017-10-04 00:37:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes

915686322404298752 2017-10-04 21:13:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter @_willparker_ lol $3600 for a two-bedroom, two-bath by the J and M trains
915685192634859521 2017-10-04 21:08:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter tho there does seem to be a bronx-specific fear though that gentrifiers won't move there
915684744586829828 2017-10-04 21:07:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter yeah but developers had negative assumptions about places like crown heights and flatbush too and you rarely see anything this stupid
915683465382825984 2017-10-04 21:02:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter plus they don't have the kind of PR teams that large developers do, that vet everything that gets released publicly
915682997659201536 2017-10-04 21:00:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter so they're like it's the wild west! i can do what i want, right?
915682925403938816 2017-10-04 20:59:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter see but it is interesting because it's people buying property who don't really develop in other parts of the city because it's too expensive
915682526252986368 2017-10-04 20:58:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter @NeoSkepticism yes, the graffiti murals are extremely common but i don't know if everyone would consider them "tone deaf" (i hate them but idk)
915681975742197761 2017-10-04 20:56:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter @_willparker_ castle braid is still the best one, but the launch of their marketing predates grendan's stint as a real estate reporter
915681773849399299 2017-10-04 20:55:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter @_willparker_ i have not forgotten! i remember this very well lol
915681593255170050 2017-10-04 20:54:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter @NeoSkepticism we're talking about different things
915681451697418241 2017-10-04 20:54:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter So he, like the Tahoe guy, is a relatively inexperienced developer when it comes to new construction in controversial, working class areas
915681257429901312 2017-10-04 20:53:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter I was comparing other neighborhoods. & Keith Rubenstein had barely done any ground up work at all, let alone in an area like the South Bronx
915680986230378496 2017-10-04 20:52:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter your point about the new Bronx is part of it though, the Bronx's former reputation and developers' feeling that the need to rehab it
915680878411599873 2017-10-04 20:51:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter i feel like racism is a lazy explanation since there are lots of market-rate developers working in various working class hoods of color
915680438072610816 2017-10-04 20:50:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter @NeoSkepticism the tone is racist but we're talking about the overall trend, not just this one guy
915680296019906560 2017-10-04 20:49:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter i think it attracts less experienced developers who haven't worked in emerging markets where their quotes & marketing is heavily scrutinized
915679802115411969 2017-10-04 20:47:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter this seems like a faulty thesis since if it were racism it would be happening everywhere
915673809256108032 2017-10-04 20:23:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Thank God no one in my hood has ever announced that they were Making Crown Heights Great Again
915673584152059904 2017-10-04 20:22:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Why are market-rate developers in the Bronx so tone-deaf when it comes to marketing? It's particularly bad there for some reason
915673277640658944 2017-10-04 20:21:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm not sure the condos will sell at these prices but \_()_/ they're still cheaper than nearly anywhere else, so....
915671603358334983 2017-10-04 20:14:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> I remember a year and a half ago when I first published this rendering! And more than two years ago the dev told me he was doing condos.https://twitter.com/Gothamist/status/915669627631489024

914989395257827329 2017-10-02 23:04:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas This suit is interesting bc Westfield very closely guards info about rents, vacancy, etc. I doubt this info would be disclosed otherwise
914988189722595328 2017-10-02 22:59:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas Honestly that would be nice but places to sit are more essential IMO
914987924323741696 2017-10-02 22:58:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas It would also be interesting to know what Westfield charges to rent out that space in the middle
914987728105873409 2017-10-02 22:57:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas So just worth noting that retail rents usually vary widely by floor - so I imagine different parts of the mall rent at different rates

911289152494284800 2017-09-22 18:00:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Choire Was genuinely disappointed that you weren't involved in the dogs learning Yiddish in Central Park story

911100204610232321 2017-09-21 05:29:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm ugh i'm going to be staring at that dumb quote in ads on the 4 train for the next year, i just know it
911099886229008385 2017-09-21 05:28:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull i literally fall asleep and then have to wake myself up to brush my teeth/wash my face/etc probably 50% of the time lol

910887495977533440 2017-09-21 15:24:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Voldemort4Mayor $2 million doesn't buy you much in nyc real estate. i assume it's going toward infrastructure work, otherwise it's a meaningless amount
910885283914293249 2017-09-21 15:15:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm i have lived here nine years and somehow, this has never happened to me. maybe it helps that i bike a lot...
910877832049496064 2017-09-21 14:46:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik it could take years for a deal with an affordable developer to come together. that announcement was recent
910877077976551425 2017-09-21 14:43:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik shrug emoji
910876995881488384 2017-09-21 14:42:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> Wooo future ped and bike lanes for the Kosciuszko!https://twitter.com/DNAinfoNY/status/910876315137511424

910872649336856581 2017-09-21 14:25:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon how does biking compare to the subway for you, time-wise?
910855339154853888 2017-09-21 13:16:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @wileycount these deals aren't necessarily good for the public but clearly the library systems don't see better options for raising the money they need
910853102806405120 2017-09-21 13:07:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @wileycount how does our chronically under-funded library system raise money it desperately needs if the gap isn't closed by city/state/fed $$
910852808471138305 2017-09-21 13:06:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @wileycount the condo-hotel deal is a separate issue from the bleacher stairs. smaller library is not a good deal for the public, but at the same time..
910696907684630533 2017-09-20 02:47:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy lol i mean there is that but that is relatively minor compared to other anxieties that come with professional journalism
910690118910070784 2017-09-20 02:20:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @themuniz Thanks! And no I only saw them in person in Manhattan
910689252966531072 2017-09-20 02:16:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dahvnyc It was incredible. Drivers were definitely pissed
910686864734085120 2017-09-20 02:07:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @schadenfraade @JakeAnbinder so picturesque pre-reno http://www.drivenbyboredom.com/dbb-gallery/Random%20Stuff/Donnell%20Library%20Says%20Goodbye%20-%2010.10.08/index.html
910685861465018368 2017-09-20 02:03:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @schadenfraade @dahvnyc hi david
910685363164909568 2017-09-20 02:01:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @schadenfraade @JakeAnbinder also, it's a gd library. it's not an ideal feature for a library but do any of these dudes know what it looked like before they did the reno
910683429255118848 2017-09-20 01:53:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @zachmortice i hope you don't mean literally, because that is a pic of the newly renovated 53rd Street library
910679483748937728 2017-09-20 01:38:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whet I mean that and the constant anxiety that you could be doing better bc it's so easy to compare yourself/people's accomplishments are public
910678920844005381 2017-09-20 01:35:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whet Idk! When I talk to people in other industries they don't seem quite so insecure/anxious about their career path
910677937078366213 2017-09-20 01:31:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> I wish someone had told me that journalism involves spending a lot of time feeling like you have perennially fucked up
910666884642672640 2017-09-20 00:47:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also we used to have cake walks all the time. NYT explains it like it's some strange foreign practice
910665296775647234 2017-09-20 00:41:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> Pretty great NYT piece about how people in rural Alaska are obsessed with boxed cake mix bc they lack fresh foodshttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/dining/cake-mix-alaska.html?_r=0
910660201988141056 2017-09-20 00:21:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @guan Sorry no
910659031223631872 2017-09-20 00:16:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> Wish I had a dollar for every man who's unfollowed me recently
910608309140508672 2017-09-20 20:55:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm @wannemachaa i'd have to check on what they plan to build, affordability-wise, because much of the project hasn't started yet
910607661208612865 2017-09-20 20:52:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm @wannemachaa sure. the affordable part of this project has income levels set by the city, not the developer. mostly through a program called MIH
910607365782810624 2017-09-20 20:51:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm @wannemachaa I recently interviewed the head of NYCHA real estate recently so we talked about NextGen (which involves basically this) at length
910606619330871296 2017-09-20 20:48:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm @wannemachaa NYCHA is in the process of leasing that property to them long-term. NYCHA usually says they aim to use that $ for repairs at the development
910606123404812288 2017-09-20 20:46:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm @wannemachaa they are developing a 100% affordable housing building on one of the parking lots at astoria houses
910605858870095872 2017-09-20 20:45:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm @wannemachaa the original rezoning was done under bloomberg, which required even less affordable housing than the current administration
910605750086569984 2017-09-20 20:45:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm @wannemachaa maybe you remember something i don't, but i think they promised to follow the EIS. roughly 25 percent of the units are affordable.
910605073134256130 2017-09-20 20:42:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm @wannemachaa or rather not very well kept commercial properties
910604918792359936 2017-09-20 20:41:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm @wannemachaa what low income housing? IIRC it was mostly industrial buildings
910604758318239745 2017-09-20 20:41:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm yeah. they claim the grocery store and other retail will mitigate that but i guess we'll see
910604297141932032 2017-09-20 20:39:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm yes. the dursts tout the new ferry stop there and the fact that they're going to run a shuttle to the subway stop
910604026412240897 2017-09-20 20:38:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also a public park, a grocery store, a blackwater treatment plant, 69,000 square feet of retail
910603495765692416 2017-09-20 20:36:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> The first building at Halletts Point recently topped out in Astoria. Full development will have 7 bldgs, 2,000 apts https://commercialobserver.com/2017/09/checking-in-with-halletts-point-in-astoria-queens/pic.twitter.com/GHFAld6O0d
910585199641219080 2017-09-20 19:23:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> oh god lol
910576973054926848 2017-09-20 18:50:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin @AlexYablon thank you for your support alex
910576812727635968 2017-09-20 18:50:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin @AlexYablon lol i only recently learned about tranches;  i am very slowly learning about all this weirdness from our finance editor
910575577932984323 2017-09-20 18:45:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin it might be zzzzzz but as one of the 10 people in your TL who cares about mortgage-backed securities, i think it's important

910555149705318400 2017-09-20 17:23:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism You can also get a zoning bonus from it

910554783597125633 2017-09-20 17:22:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism Gotta get that sweet tax break
910544353323618304 2017-09-20 16:41:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> I live three blocks away from this bar and I'll be excited if I never have to read about it againhttps://twitter.com/EaterNY/status/910534755480997888
910538139046948864 2017-09-20 16:16:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik definitely not
910538101369524231 2017-09-20 16:16:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @runlolarun @plitter yeah i don't think i could do this
910532920695193600 2017-09-20 15:55:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik no that's been in the works for ages
910530236353318913 2017-09-20 15:44:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> Tfw you find out one of your favorite abandoned buildings is being redeveloped
910359640654979074 2017-09-19 04:27:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold lol a lot of big IFs here though
910336980659171328 2017-09-19 02:57:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> is this at the top of your OKCupid profile yet
910263202100973569 2017-09-19 22:03:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TimHerrera @TaylorLorenz as long as we all know that counting calories is bad

910262182788640768 2017-09-19 21:59:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @instagram @BradyDale i stopped using it last year and i don't miss it
910244187219611648 2017-09-19 20:48:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra @MC_NYC @plitter i think if you want a big donor to do it, you need to create Friends of Brooklyn Parks Trust or something
910242294141513728 2017-09-19 20:40:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra @MC_NYC @plitter all right well not exactly. Hudson River Park Trust is a public corp., Friends of the High Line is a nonprofit
910241591029387264 2017-09-19 20:38:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra @MC_NYC @plitter he wasn't giving it to the parks department. he was giving it the Hudson River Parks Trust, which is just like Friends of the High Line
910231388544290822 2017-09-19 19:57:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> Then whose fault is it?https://twitter.com/erinmdurkin/status/910227428513116160

910178795847602177 2017-09-19 16:28:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jamesinclair @MarketUrbanism too bad plano sux. guess the advantage is reasonably priced housing
910178298822582272 2017-09-19 16:26:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism anyway @HenryGrabar wrote something about thishttp://www.slate.com/articles/business/metropolis/2017/09/your_city_will_lose_the_contest_for_amazon_s_new_hq.html
910177876598804482 2017-09-19 16:24:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i think it's obvious to people who know even a little bit about new york why they're not realistic
910160861486034944 2017-09-19 15:17:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KateAronoff are we talking about that vice piece

910130585871536128 2017-09-19 13:16:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @djlavoie @scottheins this is a valid point and an actual potential problem but the example of file clerks isn't a good one

909930063310843904 2017-09-18 00:00:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RBrillman You are not the only person in my mentions who has proposed this
909929412421963778 2017-09-18 23:57:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat I got Kelli and I think it's pretty right tbh
909921914340220928 2017-09-18 23:27:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @alon_levy Also worth noting that our friend @marketurbanism had a talent for being a bit outrageous and talking about policy at the same time
909920899746459648 2017-09-18 23:23:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy The piece is pegged to the emails controversy, which is very much #1
909920374011416577 2017-09-18 23:21:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy It has always been this way! Really good writers can talk about policy clearly and hold your attention but it takes a lot of practice
909918253119676416 2017-09-18 23:13:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy I mean, sure. You can do no policy, policy with a clickbait hook, or just straight policy. The intercept piece is talking option #1
909917884113129473 2017-09-18 23:11:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Amazing @taffyakner piece about bringing her Hasidic mother to a medical marijuana conventionhttp://www.gq.com/story/got-high-with-mom-hempcon
909916366983110656 2017-09-18 23:05:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy You're confusing being accessible with the issue of covering policy at all
909900234075099138 2017-09-18 22:01:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> Yup https://theintercept.com/2017/09/16/hillary-clinton-doesnt-understand-why-the-corporate-media-is-so-bad/pic.twitter.com/qqAWPu3ocx

909872683063619584 2017-09-18 20:12:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @no_such_zone i'm not sure it gets you one in seattle either but \_()_/
909872225238568961 2017-09-18 20:10:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @no_such_zone it's also clearly structured for people buying homes, not condos or co-ops
909872143936233473 2017-09-18 20:09:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @no_such_zone co-ops don't allow most things
909870896541786112 2017-09-18 20:05:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @scottheins yeah it's wild; the financing structure isn't totally clear to me here
909870326514929667 2017-09-18 20:02:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> Guess we can file this one under "capitalism is bad, etc" cc @gabydvj
909869843171725317 2017-09-18 20:00:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> There's a startup that gives you $50K for downpayment for a home if you agree to Airbnb a bedroom & share profitshttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/your-money/mortgages/loftium-airbnb-down-payment.html?smid=tw-share

909585562591473667 2017-09-17 01:11:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb drop me a line! i seem to continue to fail to visit d.c. these days despite having friends and extended family there lol
909584137018847233 2017-09-17 01:05:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb i guess there's nothing particular to see there besides that but i liked walking around. i also love "the eraserhood"
909583825457606656 2017-09-17 01:04:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb anyway it's a very poor, working class neighborhood. lots of great architecture but very neglected, a fair amount of abandonment

909483008750755840 2017-09-17 18:23:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin 2/3 was at least a planned outage. But 4 train service is so slow right now that it's painful
909480078953926656 2017-09-17 18:12:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> And now delays on the 4 train
909479892152209410 2017-09-17 18:11:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @reidhcooper I think it's fucked up in both directions
909478172437204997 2017-09-17 18:04:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> Basically, if you live off the A, C, F or G trains, good luck getting to Manhattan today
909474552895426560 2017-09-17 17:50:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Welp, no A train service from BK to Manhattan because of a power failure at Jay Street

908368949389283329 2017-09-14 16:36:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> "I think there are a lot of myths about gentrification," is maybe not a good look if you're gentrifying one of the city's poorest hoods

907320749211443200 2017-09-11 19:11:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> In exchange, Vice promised to add 525 jobs over 10 years to what had been 425 employees (at least in 2014)https://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-media-moving-to-new-williamsburg-headquarters-1404315035
907319635338547202 2017-09-11 19:07:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> So, if we're going to talk Aetna's tax deal, consider that Vice received $6.5M for a move that priced out several small businesses in Wburg
907317944589398016 2017-09-11 19:00:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> For reference, the state recently gave $24M to Aetna https://commercialobserver.com/2017/06/aetna-will-relocate-headquarters-from-hartford-to-chelsea/, $18M to Amazon https://commercialobserver.com/2017/09/amazon-plans-100m-distribution-warehouse-on-staten-island/, $5M to Snapchat
907314685724282880 2017-09-11 18:47:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion (Shoutout to @ProPublica for their excellent state subsidy tracker!!! https://projects.propublica.org/subsidies/)
907314222224363520 2017-09-11 18:45:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> Since I was discussing this w/ @DavidKlion, here's a rundown of all the companies that have received the tax benefit https://projects.propublica.org/subsidies/programs/excelsior-jobs-program
907313760469217281 2017-09-11 18:43:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> Aetna, Amazon, Buzzfeed, Vice, Morgan Stanley, Fresh Direct, L'Oreal, Etsy, Gap, Time Warner, and many others have gotten these tax breaks
907313044014993408 2017-09-11 18:41:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> There's a widely used state program that awards corporations that expand or move millions in tax breaks in exchange for creating jobs
907304589178937344 2017-09-11 18:07:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> Good @macfathom on all the weird drama beneath the surface of the Brooklyn DA racehttp://gothamist.com/2017/09/11/brooklyn_da_fliedner_gonzalez.php

907280463672344576 2017-09-11 16:31:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion he's given those tax breaks to amazon, spotify, morgan stanley, mastercard, buzzfeed, vice, fresh direct, and so many others...
907279190789169152 2017-09-11 16:26:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion and i guess question is how do you weigh "i don't agree with this company" against its potential economic benefits for the city and state
907276477875544064 2017-09-11 16:15:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion all the city and state see is potential tax revenue! but i get your point
907273623861448704 2017-09-11 16:04:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion the "bidding war" happens with a lot of major companies. aetna was offered financial packages by other cities; it could have gone elsewhere
907273172457848832 2017-09-11 16:02:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion and the city sees it as a shorter-term investment that will earn them property tax/payroll tax/etc in longer term https://www.nycedc.com/sites/default/files/filemanager/NYCIDA/Public_Hearing_Packages/2017_Public_Hearing_Packages/aetna_public_hearing_package.pdf
907272435392794627 2017-09-11 15:59:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion because they still need to offer financial incentives for big companies to move here. it's an expensive move, especially from hartford
907269542489018369 2017-09-11 15:48:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion eh i think aetna leaving hartford was inevitable and cuomo (and the mayor) made them an easy offer since they were coming from CT
907268787522752512 2017-09-11 15:45:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion they would get major tax breaks from the city and state, but i don't know how much money they would be willing to pony up for the city
907268571105034241 2017-09-11 15:44:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion and in nyc what we would really need is for them to pay us! in the form of being willing to subsidize major infrastructure construction
907268376212525056 2017-09-11 15:43:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion as i was saying to josh - my issue with this is really that amazon wants to be paid (in tax breaks/subsidies/w/e) to move somewhere
907257429389438977 2017-09-11 15:00:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amazon @JGoldny i think amazon is looking for a massive package of financial incentives. IMO not worth it in sunnyside unless they'll pay for part of infra
907255338533113856 2017-09-11 14:51:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JGoldny i guess i feel like (1) the deck is a pipe dream to begin with and (2) what level of gigantic tax breaks will the city/state give to amazon?

905877862535888896 2017-09-07 19:38:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> We have basically no new industrial under construction in the five boroughs, so the list of options for big e-commerce companies is v short

905564129318010885 2017-09-06 22:51:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ Most HDFC co-op purchases are all cash. Co-ops typically want more $$ down and banks do not like to lend for HDFCs

904144576667156480 2017-09-02 00:50:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber @Mottel no i haven't
904143961077448705 2017-09-02 00:48:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber @Mottel i mean if we're being real crown heights has a lot more attractive architecture so i'm not surprised
904142657731137536 2017-09-02 00:43:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber @Mottel it's mostly about people living in crown heights but the shooting happens in flatbush
904140613750312965 2017-09-02 00:34:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber @Mottel are you implying that they didn't shoot this in CH?
904137321154572292 2017-09-02 00:21:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harlanerskine also if you want to know who he is, he responded to the tweets so you can just click on his twitter bio

904126530229555201 2017-09-02 23:38:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @devin_mb Lol you can read it in five minutes, it's not a big time investment

904125107647414273 2017-09-02 23:33:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> I guess Florida has that tweetdeck search column fired uphttps://twitter.com/richard_florida/status/904123763096203265
904124240303149057 2017-09-02 23:29:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Richard_Florida I saw, but I live in NYC where the crime rate continues to go down and the population growth doesn't show many signs of slowing
904122953083883521 2017-09-02 23:24:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Millennials: "we can't afford to buy homes in big cities" Richard Florida: "young ppl are fleeing cities bc the murder rate went up a bit"
904122404619915264 2017-09-02 23:22:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @stateofthecity What?
904121212795850754 2017-09-02 23:17:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> He is right about some of this but the thing about rising crime keeping people away from cities is kind of ????
904120763543937024 2017-09-02 23:16:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> I regret to inform you that Richard Florida is at it againhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/opinion/cities-suburbs-housing-crime.html?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits&referer=https://getpocket.com/

904114730612264962 2017-09-02 22:52:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber If you know there's a movie called Crown Heights and a theater on Court Street, I feel like it's not too hard
904114050765815813 2017-09-02 22:49:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mekosoff Lol my neighborhood has a lot of cops walking around so not much street drinking happening

900075471454470145 2017-08-22 19:21:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk what are the databases in the top tier?
900068520410705922 2017-08-22 18:53:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @DanielKayHertz my issue is imagine the tens of millions spent fighting those battles in court that could instead be spent on anything else...
900067762441265154 2017-08-22 18:50:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @ptrmsk right. giving gov'ts unilateral power to seize property opens up potential for rampant corruption, and that's been the track record so far
900067278926098432 2017-08-22 18:48:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @DanielKayHertz yeah i mean people are still fighting battles with formerly communist countries' gov'ts that seized their properties...
900066948846936064 2017-08-22 18:47:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk hence why it costs the city lots of money to use eminent domain
900066780579864576 2017-08-22 18:46:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk even if we did, there's nothing stopping property owners from fighting in court, which is what usually happens
900065612118020096 2017-08-22 18:42:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Worth noting that at least one of the eminent domain battles for Atlantic Yards is still going onhttp://www.nydailynews.com/sports/i-team/atlantic-yards-project-brooklyn-family-fighting-home-article-1.2598611
900065165785407492 2017-08-22 18:40:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkchiblist not very! it should also pursue properties that don't pay property taxes much more aggressively, but it takes them years
900064812679532544 2017-08-22 18:39:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale @MarketUrbanism yes
900064589265727488 2017-08-22 18:38:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale that's a lot of words for that then
900064131671347201 2017-08-22 18:36:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale you think?? he's saying gov'ts should seize private properties for housing, and the way we typically do that is eminent domain
900063350096252932 2017-08-22 18:33:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> But eminent domain, as it's currently structured, typically involves years of court battles and millions in legal fees paid by taxpayers
900063212670001153 2017-08-22 18:32:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> The city can and should aggressively pursue foreclosed properties and develop its vacant/derelict lots.
900061125890498561 2017-08-22 18:24:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj he blogs 12 times a day, that's what he does
900060978347462656 2017-08-22 18:23:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> Eminent domain is a very expensive way for the government to "seize" property in order to build housinghttps://theoutline.com/post/2153/evict-the-rich

899647327786422272 2017-08-21 15:00:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @julianagyeman @alexbaca @alon_levy and pretty much everywhere, SNAP benefits (food stamps) can only be used for food
899646562674122752 2017-08-21 14:57:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @julianagyeman @alexbaca @alon_levy also many states have restrictions on how TANF funds can be used. potentially bikeshare would need a legal carve-out http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/ebt-electronic-benefit-transfer-card-restrictions-for-public-assistance.aspx#table

899643676166676486 2017-08-21 14:45:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @julianagyeman @alon_levy @alexbaca I think that would have to be negotiated with the state, which disburses EBT.

898559257980829697 2017-08-18 14:56:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm sure there are many businesses and folks worth profiling in the Bronx who don't have PR representation
898558189687406592 2017-08-18 14:52:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> Nice to see these businesses highlighted, but frustrating to read 2-3 stories that were pitched & packaged - possibly by the same PR people

898204378808672257 2017-08-17 15:26:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas though i believe the majority of the construction funding is from the developers, Related and Vornadohttps://commercialobserver.com/2017/06/state-finalizes-1-6b-deal-with-related-vornado-and-skanska-for-moynihan-train-hall/
898203789613780992 2017-08-17 15:24:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i am pretty sure it's being funded through ESD

898203605563580417 2017-08-17 15:23:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> What is the point of this latest unnecessarily long Cuomo presser? Are we officially starting construction or something

892778281703010305 2017-08-02 16:05:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @ltvsquad "happening" seems like a strong statement. i haven't seen much in the way of movement
892777552628117504 2017-08-02 16:02:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @2AvSagas i find people's inability to be clear re: activism & policy on these kinds of issues extremely frustrating. creates a lot of misinformation
892777295873806336 2017-08-02 16:01:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @2AvSagas in this instance you need to separate out those two bc most of these areas are already gentrified and developers directly pushed this plan
892776723326152704 2017-08-02 15:58:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly you guys should come!!! i'm not good at planning things, we could take a trip soon
892776620083347456 2017-08-02 15:58:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @ltvsquad or you don't think that areas w/ dramatically rising real estate values (higher value capture potential) should determine transit planning
892776327627108361 2017-08-02 15:57:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @ltvsquad you could say, however, that it's not acceptable for the city to be taking direct cues from developers who backed this plan
892776129278472193 2017-08-02 15:56:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @ltvsquad you could make this argument about basically any new piece of transit in the five boroughs so it's not really a productive one
892775421531402240 2017-08-02 15:53:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly the hamptons are basically impossible without a car tho which sucks, so for me it means if i go i have to convince someone or rent one

890284243460468736 2017-07-26 18:54:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter I think it's just the tabloid instinct of picking the one thing that they think riders will really care about

890268381437362182 2017-07-26 17:51:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> Honestly it's kind of funny that Lhota talked about 20 different things yesterday and everyone is fixated on removing the seats

890201268920217601 2017-07-26 13:24:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MTA @nandelabra And by important I mean "thing that people might care about/make them click on our story." Since replacing signals/tracks isn't exciting
890201010983096320 2017-07-26 13:23:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MTA @nandelabra This has been the takeaway from this story because I guess it's what news orgs think is important. But it was a small piece of Lhota's plan

890025738375659521 2017-07-25 01:47:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly One of the things that will fix the MTA! Definitely not the only thing

890000302237245441 2017-07-25 00:06:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> 80% of the reporters in the TL were covering the healthcare vote today, but all us local folks were reporting on the MTA
889999934212255744 2017-07-25 00:04:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> My headstone will read that I died hand-coding HTML for a fucking slideshow
889999260133056512 2017-07-25 00:02:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you ever design a news org CMS, the actual worst thing you can do is make one that involves hand-coding the formatting for slide shows
889997209470685184 2017-07-25 23:54:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @melissagira more details on this: MTA: http://www.mtamovingforward.com/# NYDN: http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mta-boss-rolls-1b-plan-revive-degrading-subways-article-1.3355224  amny: http://www.amny.com/transit/mta-releases-joe-lhota-s-reorganization-plan-to-fix-subway-1.13822080  me: https://commercialobserver.com/2017/07/mta-releases-830m-plan-to-fix-the-subways-asks-city-to-split-the-bill/
889996251852394496 2017-07-25 23:50:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @melissagira announcements specifically? i think he said he wanted to get rid of prerecorded announcements for delays. it was a minor part of the presser
889993292741529600 2017-07-25 23:38:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @melissagira but yes, he did also say that stuff about ticketing people for trash and telling folks not to lean on the train doors
889993146293202944 2017-07-25 23:37:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @melissagira I mean... I covered his presser earlier (which I assume is what they're showing) and he actually proposed quite a lot of maintenance work
889963160186343424 2017-07-25 21:38:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GloriaPazmino lol 20 reporters sitting on the floor of the city hall R station

889939442177277952 2017-07-25 20:04:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter your office is around the corner!! you should come to an MTA thing one of these days; this was my first one
889938724796203010 2017-07-25 20:01:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> Will he be taking ~off-topic~ questions
889938577328668673 2017-07-25 20:01:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> ** sorry it's $830 million - $450M in operating costs and $380M in capital investment
889938001157128194 2017-07-25 19:58:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> Because unless you can tell reporters whether you plan to pony up $400M to fix the subways, there is pretty much no point

889929210705444866 2017-07-25 19:23:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> I feel bad for people watching this live feed because Lhota's mic does not seem to be working well
889928095058317313 2017-07-25 19:19:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter You can usually get the live feed if you email their press office

889926237635923968 2017-07-25 19:12:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> People in this presser chuckling as Lhota says MTA will execute major capital improvements on time and on budget

889922526587088901 2017-07-25 18:57:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Lhota says MTA will start adding cars to trains when possible (on lines where platforms can accommodate it), like on the C line

888588090704580608 2017-07-21 02:34:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Might have to have a come-to-Jesus talk with one of my neighbors about this though, since it's always one of your downstairs neighbors
888587636142637056 2017-07-21 02:32:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> I am blessed, honestly, in that I have not had roaches between the four years between then and now
888587474573852673 2017-07-21 02:32:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> Because the first summer I moved into this apartment, there were tiny ones that would hang out on my counter and hide inside my coffee maker

888586871735037956 2017-07-21 02:29:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nandelabra I didn't get a chance to do it before it crawled back under there but next time I will be prepared
888586496919449600 2017-07-21 02:28:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> I saw a huge cockroach crawl out from under my fridge earlier and my first thought, after revulsion, was "at least it's not the tiny ones"
888552557353861121 2017-07-21 00:13:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TonyaJoRiley I spent a lot of years feeling like talking about my problems was burdensome so I think that will take a while to reverse

888140618395987972 2017-07-20 20:56:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's really cool when you email the Port Authority questions and then their response is: "a release is coming from the governor's office"

887749627390439424 2017-07-19 19:02:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter i think putting it in your bare skin when you're not used to the retinoids is what really irritates it...
887749333545889792 2017-07-19 19:01:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter :(. i've been really careful with the epiduo because i hate BP. i put it on top of my moisturizer and it's actually been pretty fine
887748585349107713 2017-07-19 18:58:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @facepaulmrevere @plitter also i recently caved & finally went to a derm and now i use epiduo forte (BP + and a retinoid). i was afraid initially but it really helped
887748237867855873 2017-07-19 18:57:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @facepaulmrevere @plitter also cutting out dairy had the positive side effect of fixing some stomach issues too/forced me to eat healthier in general
887748066031349761 2017-07-19 18:56:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @facepaulmrevere @plitter it was a bit of an adjustment and i was sad about cheese initially but honestly now i notice i break out every time i fuck up and eat dairy
887747666486206464 2017-07-19 18:55:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @facepaulmrevere @plitter i totally cut out dairy bc of acne and it has been great. i like almond milk in coffee (sorry!) and i've found good vegan cheese, ice cream
887737629873254401 2017-07-19 18:15:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harrysiegel @DaveCoIon i have done that to @KELLYWEILL many times
887737224657350670 2017-07-19 18:13:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harrysiegel ugh harry
887736996088754176 2017-07-19 18:12:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Cyphran yes! Rene does a good job of discussing those with journalists; i'm glad he reminded me of those studies
887734367589736448 2017-07-19 18:02:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> Shoutout to excellent journalists who covered these before me, including @nathantempey @danielleiat @GwynneFitz @EmilyNonko @rachelholliday
887733362059882511 2017-07-19 17:58:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> I also talked about 2 gardens that sit on private lots and are fighting developers in court who purchased the property in questionable sales
887733100737966082 2017-07-19 17:57:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> I wrote about community gardens across NYC fighting the city's plans to develop affordable housing on their lots https://commercialobserver.com/2017/07/nyc-community-gardens-fight-developers-for-survival/pic.twitter.com/ZE77l7gmRh

887454756070928384 2017-07-18 23:31:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj i believe @nandelabra has a rec for this
887452041316118529 2017-07-18 23:20:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC your tweets are geo-tagged. you can turn it off in twitter app settings.
887450235118682112 2017-07-18 23:13:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC (1) are you actually in Montana rn? And (2) I am going to Montreal in 10 days and I will explore this then
887448968262823939 2017-07-18 23:08:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @kittertwitty I appreciate your support on this important issue
887445311051968513 2017-07-18 22:53:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @kittertwitty lol yeah people are all up in my mentions about this right now, responding to this tweet
887443400894689284 2017-07-18 22:46:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb lol what
887439740177461248 2017-07-18 22:31:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> I will not change my opinion on DC bagels; do not @ me
887439353282220033 2017-07-18 22:30:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber No
887434787643957248 2017-07-18 22:11:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jesserker @kasperka @DavidKlion well and i think jana was talking specifically about like bagel shops/places to get bagels, not grocery stores
887433993796411396 2017-07-18 22:08:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka @DavidKlion Bethesda is not in the District!!
887433543806324736 2017-07-18 22:06:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion i remain extremely skeptical. i also remember when @kasperka was upset she couldn't find lox anywhere in D.C. in like 2012
887430996676796416 2017-07-18 21:56:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> D.C. has mediocre bagels and now they blaspheme with this garbagehttps://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/887425921380220929
887428336938610688 2017-07-18 21:46:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whet since the original blog post seems to put all athletic activities in the same category (logarithmic)
887428134404067328 2017-07-18 21:45:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whet ehhhhhh i think he's just equating his lame nostalgia with math and possibly also not understanding the math.
887426257956347906 2017-07-18 21:38:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danrivoli @AnnaESanders i think they would enforce it selectively against people they already want to target, just like panhandling/performing/turnstyle jumping
887425455757959170 2017-07-18 21:34:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whet i was a fencer for 14 years. logarithmic or exponential? or literally who tf cares?
887425246499930118 2017-07-18 21:34:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whet i've read this more than once and i still think these sports categories are completely arbitrary
887423078879424512 2017-07-18 21:25:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Trump @mattdrange I cover NYC real estate for a living, and it's hard to get a response from the internal PRs at Trump Org, even on non-controversial stories
887422072913371136 2017-07-18 21:21:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman @AlexCKaufman yeah happy birthday cale!!!
887413168393396224 2017-07-18 20:46:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon honestly the twitter mentions don't look bad but maybe i'm missing something

887392833111543808 2017-07-18 19:25:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj extremely agree
887392128044867585 2017-07-18 19:22:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat @agrenell i still find this narrative hilarious
887391608701935616 2017-07-18 19:20:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @agrenell @danielleiat williamsburg is a terrible place, as we all know
887389933291417602 2017-07-18 19:13:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull i need a nap
887389142757367808 2017-07-18 19:10:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mekosoff i am guilty of this, but with "lol"
887388974666403840 2017-07-18 19:09:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat isn't this actually against the law if they have more than like eight seats? this shit always drives me crazy too
887388788724465664 2017-07-18 19:09:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mekosoff i feel like most people i know who do this are men

887388254902919168 2017-07-18 19:07:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> Glad to hear the Jewish Hospital complex, after years of fighting, has gotten officially rent stabilizedhttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170717/crown-heights/rent-deal-brooklyn-jewish-hospital-complex-crown-heights
887387003662323712 2017-07-18 19:02:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> When like 10 people in the TL are arguing with Freddie DeB***, it's time to log off
887374951694598144 2017-07-18 18:14:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bhargreaves @KonradPutzier what the fuck is he talking about
887372947316510720 2017-07-18 18:06:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale in addition, giving cops yet another tool with which to harass poor people is not what you want
887372859655557122 2017-07-18 18:05:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale i agree. but the issue here is deferred maintenance that causes track fires/delays/signal issues. banning food will not fix that
887372657141964801 2017-07-18 18:05:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand @polly IMO there is rarely a reason to pay more than 20 bucks for a bottle of wine
887371039700901888 2017-07-18 17:58:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikesisak @AlexSilverman @weeseandbeyond really? possibly. but i also think it is hard to offset years of delayed maintenance
887366205241270272 2017-07-18 17:39:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikesisak @AlexSilverman https://www.popville.com/2014/09/heads-up-metro-starting-to-actively-enforce-no-drinkingeating-on-trains-and-platforms/
887366009040097281 2017-07-18 17:38:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikesisak @AlexSilverman yes. i have personally been yelled at by the cops, and my mom has stories about getting tickets for bottled water going back to the 90s
887363758322053126 2017-07-18 17:29:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danrivoli @c3pohara keeps the train nice; has nothing to do with safety
887363643016437760 2017-07-18 17:29:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, do we really need to give the cops more reasons to ticket people for dumb things on the subway?
887363498296188929 2017-07-18 17:28:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Are there fewer bugs? Probably, but it helps that most of the D.C. metro is much newer than the NYC subway
887363246918914048 2017-07-18 17:27:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> They have had this on the D.C. metro forever and it's not making the WMATA system any safer or preventing track fireshttps://twitter.com/AlexSilverman/status/887336485778849792

887043207988748288 2017-07-17 20:15:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also I love that the people who claim they've never been scooped are the oldest/most famous journos on here (Janet Malcolm and Tom Wolfe)https://twitter.com/kateconger/status/887032299883081728

885980429190389760 2017-07-14 21:52:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty i'm not really sure how this is "socialist" but ok
885978493800116224 2017-07-14 21:45:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly right, matchmaking for casual sex (rather than matchmaking for relationships)
885977583522914309 2017-07-14 21:41:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly is it just me or is "Dick Socialism" actually just matchmaking, basically

885544014690340865 2017-07-13 16:58:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> C&W, which has totally different data, claims the market is going up and everything is great! Whatever.
885542799214510080 2017-07-13 16:53:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> As with all market-related stories, brokers say everything is rosy, researchers say it's bleak, and diff brokerages claim different things

885521230677389312 2017-07-13 15:28:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gridwachs @MosesNYC @JacobGarchik the question is why won't the city step in and fund more affordable hsg here? pride? they think they can get more $$ out of the developer?

885233572340224002 2017-07-12 20:25:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon maybe the LL refused to make repairs, or he just raised the rent and they were not having it
885233397546844160 2017-07-12 20:24:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon if the bar went that long without paying rent and allowed themselves to be evicted, they were clearly holding out for something
885232776362045442 2017-07-12 20:21:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon you should talk to the landlord, whoever that is
885231941607456769 2017-07-12 20:18:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon gotta pay to keep the lights, water and gas on and pay the property taxes, at bare minimum. capitalism!
885231398164066304 2017-07-12 20:16:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon also that marshal's sign means the landlord actually took them to court to evict them, which is a pretty long process.
885230359780175876 2017-07-12 20:12:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon $180K!!! That sounds like they must have gone close to a year without paying rent. no wonder they're being evicted

885154924048338946 2017-07-12 15:12:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand it was, ultimately, kind of prohibitively expensive compared to a regular day camp though. i only did it for a summer or two, for two weeks
885154577649152001 2017-07-12 15:11:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand i think i went to sleep away camp for the same reason i went to regular camp, which is my parents both worked/didn't want me to sit at home

884447190621540353 2017-07-10 16:20:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ and technically you could rent a stabilized unit with a high income like that but your landlord would then have justification to deregulate
884446596422914049 2017-07-10 16:17:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ not exactly. it's called "high-rent deregulation" and i don't make more than $200K (nor am i anywhere close) so i'm not concerned
884445801992384512 2017-07-10 16:14:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner @EisenPress i mean i don't know the opening date of the 34th Street one but probably

884420570561073152 2017-07-10 14:34:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith i'm sad you've left the real estate beat :(
884419933169487872 2017-07-10 14:31:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just bc a landlord stops registering a building with the state as rent-stabilized does not mean they can start giving out free market leases
884419599470661632 2017-07-10 14:30:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> "I gut renovated the bldg and now it's deregulated" is not a thing unless rents are/were raised to the deregulation threshold (now $2700/mo)
884418358711640066 2017-07-10 14:25:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> My landlord tried to pull this exact same shit.

883360968369164289 2017-07-07 16:24:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ honestly that's exactly what i assumed when i saw this. unions torching non-union sites happens in chicago, philly, a few other places

883345868925095937 2017-07-07 15:24:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ethanchiel @NoahHurowitz disagree, think starbucks bathrooms are less likely to be clean/more likely to be closed than yr average bathroom, esp in high traffic areas

882973397155753985 2017-07-06 14:43:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism right. well and it seems like they're talking not just about office dev but also hotel and self storage, which as we know is booming

882762691013734400 2017-07-05 00:46:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty I still eat meat but turns out dairy is bad for my skin and my gut
882762451103756289 2017-07-05 00:45:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty Oh! I cut out dairy like a year ago; I think I am better for it
882761198466473984 2017-07-05 00:40:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty Also do you do any faux yogurts like that? I'm just discovering this world; it didn't occur to me to look into this when I cut dairy

882748783607545857 2017-07-05 23:51:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just bought vegan cheese for the first time
882708099295039489 2017-07-05 21:09:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly i gave up dairy last year and i've just sort of avoided anything involving cheese rather than trying to find substitutes

882456297567924224 2017-07-04 04:29:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @StreetsblogNYC @BrooklynSpoke they also did this with the pulaski, which is possibly more of a travesty because people who need to use that bridge have no other option
882449368464470016 2017-07-04 04:01:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @benyankee @NoahHurowitz who was like "we're making this random sort of moral judgement about whether this guy's identity should be revealed"?
882449078948421632 2017-07-04 04:00:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @benyankee @NoahHurowitz exactly! that's the bizarre part. i'm really wondering what editor thought those sentences were a good idea
882448699422633985 2017-07-04 03:58:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @benyankee @NoahHurowitz well and all this discussion about how he apologized/isn't going to do it again/so we decided not to doxx him?.. idk seems weird to me
882447602867941377 2017-07-04 03:54:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @benyankee and it's kind of weird. are they like the judge and jury of the internet? what's this moral code they're invoking here?

882446191094583297 2017-07-04 03:49:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @benyankee and in fact their explanation about it is very odd
882446026589818882 2017-07-04 03:48:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @benyankee ben the whole point is they decided not to out him
882445296885788672 2017-07-04 03:45:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jarid i had a friend with an illegal apartment in northern greenpoint and an amazing view. too bad he stopped having july 4th parties!!
882440925083049984 2017-07-04 03:28:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jarid ah i see! i thought that parcel i consider Hunters Point was under construction so i was a little confused
882437488404508673 2017-07-04 03:14:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jarid This isn't from the park?
882436835548463104 2017-07-04 03:11:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair Also seemed like there was a crazy line to get into the park
882436647006203905 2017-07-04 03:11:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair Ugh Kent Ave was awful. Cops, tons of pedestrians in bike lanes
882436509948837890 2017-07-04 03:10:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jarid If I had known the cops were going to be chill about the LIC waterfront this year I definitely would have gone there
882436129823305729 2017-07-04 03:09:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jarid Damn I remember Hunters Point seeming crazy last year. North Greenpoint waterfront was packed
882435070325403648 2017-07-04 03:04:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ I didn't bike through all of north BK last year so maybe I missed it but there was a big police presence all along the waterfront
882434861008650240 2017-07-04 03:04:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jarid So many cops along the north Brooklyn waterfront! The whole way. It was crazy

882433970000015364 2017-07-04 03:00:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> Me: Why are you closing the Pulaski bike and pedestrian lanes when you didn't last year? Cop: \_()_/
882432491088379904 2017-07-04 02:54:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jarid I watched the fireworks from the bridge last year! And the cops couldn't even tell me why it was closed
882419373348200448 2017-07-04 02:02:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> Why would NYPD close Pulaski Bridge during fireworks? (1) where is everyone supposed to watch from and (2) how are they gonna get to LIC?!
882390684799520768 2017-07-04 00:08:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion i thought you wouldn't be able to see them from there this year
882381799812464640 2017-07-04 23:33:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion i love the day where they open up all the mausolea and hire actors to pretend to be the dead people!!
882372205434294273 2017-07-04 22:55:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka we were also proud when you got internet at your apartment
882369127964344320 2017-07-04 22:42:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion And technically weren't their asses kicked on the site of what is now Green-wood? At least that's what the tour guides there like to say
882368749059416064 2017-07-04 22:41:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion This is why I tell people to visit Green-Wood Cemetery
882358844248264705 2017-07-04 22:01:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty @DanielKayHertz Yeah I've seen that. They've done few new construction here but it's hard to do new big retail spaces where they want so there aren't many
882356145389789185 2017-07-04 21:51:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty And landmarked buildings require more $$ upkeep, so those landlords really want a tenant who can pay top dollar
882355770599276548 2017-07-04 21:49:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty Basically yes. Apple looks for unique spaces in prime locations. More traditional retail tenants don't necessarily want a former bank
882352687714586625 2017-07-04 21:37:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> This exhibit (Lygia Pape) is interesting. As is video exhibit downstairs, Body Politic, part of which was produced for Kanye's last albumpic.twitter.com/gmUpRFmc7n

882266502308614145 2017-07-04 15:55:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bfishbfish @lemonsand lol I was a medium at AA if I was lucky! Also Rebecca - their website claims they're relaunching in the fall?
882265221624213507 2017-07-04 15:49:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand Are their jeans actually good? I'm not sure I've ever owned a pair, and back in the day finding the right fit there was hard
882264663848824832 2017-07-04 15:47:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bfishbfish @lemonsand They tended to be made for shorter ladies in general if you could deal with the other aspects of the fit/sized up
882264343311724545 2017-07-04 15:46:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand Levi's has been having a good sale online and in-store and their jeans come in lengths (28 is the shortest)

882213472246923264 2017-07-04 12:24:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy I wouldn't pretend to speak for anyone but myself
882074542470033408 2017-07-03 03:12:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> these tweets made me realize we need a roach emoji on the iphone
882072601769762816 2017-07-03 03:04:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @essayolumhense ever since i tend to walk around store awnings attached to old buildings while i'm on the sidewalk, especially during the summer
882072272089092096 2017-07-03 03:03:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @essayolumhense it happened to me as i was walking into my corner bodega in crown heights a few years ago
882067600624300038 2017-07-03 02:44:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @ejenk and after decades of being viewed as very unsafe, i think NYers relish that we are finally sort of safe (though its kind of an illusion)
882066743136587776 2017-07-03 02:41:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @ejenk that i think is tied to when new york not only had high crime rates but literally everything else was going to hell, including our transit
882066536906846208 2017-07-03 02:40:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @ejenk i'm not sure it's that. but i think it's an outdated mentality about what crime rates mean in terms of everything else in a city...
882065488544751620 2017-07-03 02:36:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz not the NYDN cover but some of the tweets i've seen
882065356378042368 2017-07-03 02:35:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz to me it reads like - if you can't manage schools/crime/quality of life factors, why should we assume you're doing a good job with transit
882064717488979968 2017-07-03 02:33:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz mm i could see that
882064165376061443 2017-07-03 02:30:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i guess i see it as more a commentary on the fact that people see crime rates as a proxy for whether a city is well-managed
882063308530036737 2017-07-03 02:27:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz maggie's been in the game long enough to remember when NYC got lots of press for having a high crime rate and thus viewed as mismanaged
882059726149869568 2017-07-03 02:13:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whet oh you're talking about maggie haberman's tweet
882059076586393604 2017-07-03 02:10:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whet i did also solicit the opinions of real chicago people though
882058736499654656 2017-07-03 02:09:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whet sorry whet
882052080780881920 2017-07-03 01:42:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @S_Evangelina happened to me at my corner bodega
882051348585480192 2017-07-03 01:40:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> i have also had food poisoning in midtown... it is the worst place in nyc to be ill
882050637403492353 2017-07-03 01:37:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty thank you for your support during this dark time. i'd like to think i've already paid my NYC roach debt, so hopefully not anytime soon
882039249972981760 2017-07-03 00:51:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty This is what happens when you have 8 million people on top of each other with all their fucking trash in 90 degree weather
882038835898699777 2017-07-03 00:50:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm Fell on me from the awning of my corner bodega, which I still go to all the time! Lol it took a while for me to return though
882038659721121792 2017-07-03 00:49:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nkhensley Honestly I wouldn't expect it in the subway system as much. I had one fall on me from an awning as I was going into my corner bodega
882038404602634241 2017-07-03 00:48:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm It happened to me in like 2012 or 2013, within my first year out of college and living in Crown Heights
882038070522126341 2017-07-03 00:47:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty Peak roaches during the summer, obviously
882037920521220096 2017-07-03 00:46:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you think it won't happen to you...trust me, it will one day
882036073723027456 2017-07-03 00:39:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> We've reached that season in New York City in which roaches just sort of fall on you when you least expect it
882013625329831936 2017-07-03 23:10:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rmc031 @oscarthinks Oh cool
882007432532242434 2017-07-03 22:45:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rmc031 @oscarthinks now if only they could do that for stuff happening in new york city
881996135296110595 2017-07-03 22:00:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @oscarthinks on second read it seems like this really should have been about FHA enforcement (and much of the reporting seems to speak to that)
881995482062618625 2017-07-03 21:58:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> On that note, this stuff about the Fair Housing Act (which feels like the bigger driver of this article than LIHTCs) should be further uppic.twitter.com/JbwaTQaFd1
881994142561312769 2017-07-03 21:52:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @oscarthinks this might also be a case of bad headline writing. it seems like they make better points later on but part of it doesn't hang together
881988267163492354 2017-07-03 21:29:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> Go watch Show Me a Hero and/or attend a rezoning meeting & then tell me whether affordable development credits are to blame for segregation
881986276693610496 2017-07-03 21:21:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> A big chunk of this also has to do with NIMBYs killing an affordable hsg project in an affluent neighborhood, not with LIHTC
881985482388889601 2017-07-03 21:18:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> Maybe we could talk about how HUD didn't enforce the Fair Housing Act for half a century, essentially allowing cities to de-facto segregate
881984860105166848 2017-07-03 21:15:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> A whole host of federal/state/local policies certainly have, but eliding all of those does a disservice to the paper's readers
881984549550522368 2017-07-03 21:14:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> Some bizarre logic here from NYT, which charges that the Low Income Housing Tax Credit reinforces segregationhttps://nyti.ms/2uztXus
881984117914599427 2017-07-03 21:12:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold @mparkin2 @im_sinclair Didn't anyone watch "Show Me a Hero"? Come on!
881983771892998144 2017-07-03 21:11:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold @mparkin2 @im_sinclair And they don't address the separate issue of HUD not enforcing the Fair Housing Act for 40+ years (tho they mention those rules in passing)
881977602680000512 2017-07-03 20:47:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> I had no idea what a "backfield editor" was but this post explains it and proposed changes to NYT's editing process https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/06/02/nyt-standards-chief-on-editorial-streamlining-im-always-worried/https://twitter.com/cjr/status/881965772016279552

881969696165285889 2017-07-03 20:15:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> As I would expect, @DanielKayHertz already did a good piece about Chicago's inequitable public transit systemhttps://twitter.com/jake_bittle/status/881968060336353280

880867717317881860 2017-06-30 19:16:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DGisSERIOUS thank you. you may also be aware of this, but his former stash spot at 560 State Street (now condos) is well knownhttps://www.zillow.com/blog/jay-zs-former-crib-hits-market-143624/
880866853115056128 2017-06-30 19:13:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Crazy that condos in Dumbo once sold for less than a million, but I guess that's how it was in 2006.
880865736763297793 2017-06-30 19:08:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you guys are into this, StreetEasy lists all the sale prices going back to when this building launchedhttps://streeteasy.com/building/the-clock-tower#tab_building_detail=2
880864856966037504 2017-06-30 19:05:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> Looking at TRD and original sale prices for condos at 1 Main St (circa 2006), Jay-Z's estimate is basically right. https://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/dumbo-defies-odds/pic.twitter.com/Pvr6XFzkNB
880863295426768896 2017-06-30 18:59:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull are you moving??
880863089939402752 2017-06-30 18:58:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> Jay-Z is apparently referring to the Clocktower building in Dumbo. He checked out the $25M penthouse there in 2010 http://nypost.com/2010/01/21/clock-watch/https://twitter.com/tomgara/status/880849694708072449
880852612672880642 2017-06-30 18:16:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tomgara @MattZeitlin @benmuessig he is also known for keeping a stash spot at 560 State Street (now condos) but that's not in Dumbo
880850824372596736 2017-06-30 18:09:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tomgara @MattZeitlin @benmuessig yeah he looked at that property back in 2010, and it was very expensive even thenhttps://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/dumbo-defies-odds/

880522766394556418 2017-06-29 20:26:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> Hartford Courant obviously did a lot of great coverage on thishttp://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-aetna-reports-of-moving-0531-20170530-story.html
880522494872080384 2017-06-29 20:24:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> The more stories I read about how CT's cash-strapped gov't fought to keep Aetna in Hartford, the sadder I feelhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/11/nyregion/hartford-aetna-relocation.html?_r=0

880452822227136514 2017-06-29 15:48:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> usually there's long bidding/negotiating process involved with securing a contract with MTA. they pick the firm that will do it for least $$
880451985476116481 2017-06-29 15:44:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> basically a suspension of contracts with firms that normally do repair work, and of lengthy approval process involved w/ getting a contract
880449591346376704 2017-06-29 15:35:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> So all Cuomo's "State of Emergency" does is suspend procurement rules for the MTA? https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/Executive_Order_Disaster_Emergency.pdf

880227423710785536 2017-06-28 00:52:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> I get accused of being a "dyed in the wool" capitalist at least 2x a day, sometimes by people I'm interviewing.

880177869359648772 2017-06-28 21:35:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TimTakesTime I am speaking purely from a factual perspective, not defending what he's doing in the South Bronx (which will have huge gentrifying effect)
880177234929217536 2017-06-28 21:33:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TimTakesTime This his first resi development, so I'm not sure where else that would be true besides the South Bronx. He mostly owned offices before this

880131069802164224 2017-06-28 18:29:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> I mentioned this story to a tenant attorney I was interviewing, and he asked, "Did you ask him how much he got paid for selling his soul?"

880092669862608897 2017-06-28 15:56:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @loufreshwater i canoed along the Bronx River last summer (have you done this? if not, highly recommended) and the amount of trash in there is crazy
880092352131473409 2017-06-28 15:55:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @loufreshwater yeah i know that's a huge problem along most of the Bronx waterfront, tho particularly in the former industrial stretch on the Harlem river
880091681172881408 2017-06-28 15:53:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @loufreshwater yes, as i note in the second graf of the story

880089469084467201 2017-06-28 15:44:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> His house is crazy - a red Hermes-leather covered billiards room, a lit-up sign that says "Forever" above the mantlehttp://streeteasy.com/sale/1209833
880089002254245890 2017-06-28 15:42:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> He also recently finalized a lease for this children's role playing business (KidZania) at the long-struggling American Dream Mall in NJ
880088315382218752 2017-06-28 15:39:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> Despite his roots defending tenants in court, he told me he doesn't see his South Bronx megaproject as an engine of gentrification
880088135878627328 2017-06-28 15:38:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Some fun facts about Keith: he started out as a tenant attorney and his crazy UES townhouse is on the market for $85 million
880074988258074624 2017-06-28 14:46:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> I interviewed Keith Rubenstein, the developer behind "Piano District" who's building 1300 apts in the South Bronxhttp://commercialobserver.com/2017/06/keith-rubenstein-talks-his-south-bronx-megaproject-his-85m-townhouse-and-kidzania/

880052679757762560 2017-06-28 13:18:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @WNYC @katehinds the dummies had heart and lung sounds, veins, you could speak thru them using a mic in the booth of the lab room. definitely uncanny valley
880052357681250304 2017-06-28 13:16:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @WNYC @katehinds i helped simulate heart attacks, diabetic shock, death, etc. occasionally i would speak thru mic and pretend to be the "patient" (a dummy)
880051988628746241 2017-06-28 13:15:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @WNYC @katehinds i worked @ NYU College of Nursing's simulation labs. made fake blood, bile, drugs, set up foley catheters, pretended to be patient relatives

879896126954012672 2017-06-27 02:55:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ScottLucas86 roland, who is much more knowledgeable about this stuff than i, made some good points on thishttps://twitter.com/rolandlisf/status/878812312169103360
879895374101696512 2017-06-27 02:52:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ScottLucas86 i think if you come in as an outsider and sensationalize something without offering enough context... that's what you're doing
879895237002395654 2017-06-27 02:52:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ScottLucas86 i call it parachute journalism when it's bad because unfortunately when it comes to gentrification-related topics, it's often what it is
879894740778594304 2017-06-27 02:50:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ScottLucas86 it's the worst kind of parachute journalism. people think they can play on the emotional narrative of gentrification to mask lazy reporting
879894548452958208 2017-06-27 02:49:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ScottLucas86 great piece in curbed too! anyway, reading it i felt like his research wasn't thorough, he talked to 5-10 ppl, hadn't checked public records
879888455098085376 2017-06-27 02:25:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ScottLucas86 i'm no expert on SF but having done a lot of reporting on housing and real estate in NYC, i agree

879739007730683904 2017-06-27 16:31:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull \_()_/ they also have a media reporter. and haven't they been moving into more general biz coverage that isn't necessarily fashion?
879727810486644736 2017-06-27 15:47:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn agree
879726371702005761 2017-06-27 15:41:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> Can't decide if I'm excited or sad that Preet is joining the blogging game
879712579374993408 2017-06-27 14:46:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale jesus. i'm assuming you've seen that that there was an A train derailment in Harlem

879704400821837824 2017-06-27 14:14:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> A lot of people are wondering why Cuomo re-assigned 200 state troopers (at a cost of $41m) from upstate to NYChttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/nyregion/cuomos-deployment-of-troopers-in-city-frustrates-police-leaders.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=2&referer=

879168792768761858 2017-06-25 02:45:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale !!
879168076503146496 2017-06-25 02:42:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart it fills me with doom
879152193122783233 2017-06-25 01:39:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @3rdFloorWindow NYCHA is unique in the scale of its needs. in general NYC has a lot more power to fix its own shit than most places, which was his point
879150856616067074 2017-06-25 01:34:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @3rdFloorWindow when you're $17 billion in the hole, the feds are the only ones with pockets deep enough to even come close to funding those repairs
879149956564692992 2017-06-25 01:30:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @3rdFloorWindow city has a lot of other funding needs. whatever it could feasibly provide would still be a drop in the bucket in terms of what NYCHA needs
879143549836591105 2017-06-25 01:05:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @3rdFloorWindow anyway, check the latest NYCHA budget. you can see the city funding commitments for yourself. it's not a new thing
879142135232122880 2017-06-25 00:59:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @3rdFloorWindow i believe the city has also pledged $300M to fix roofs at NYCHA projects
879141381989707776 2017-06-25 00:56:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @3rdFloorWindow the current mayoral admin has pledged about $200m to NYCHA. NYCHA is not a city agency, it's a state one that was built with federal funds
879131996856963074 2017-06-25 00:19:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale yeah i don't really wanna have to listen to the whole thing again to check someone else's transcription. i might as well have done it myself
879131580278730754 2017-06-25 00:17:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale also the observer has a lot of interns right now. it's gotta be like five or six
879131470916448256 2017-06-25 00:17:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale oh i know. apparently lauren says she's used the interns before but i feel like it's not a great idea since we cover technical stuff
879130354904428544 2017-06-25 00:13:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> Who among you actually relies on interns to transcribe your interviews
879119413777182720 2017-06-25 23:29:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj @KELLYWEILL gotta shit talk without shame
879105426486419456 2017-06-25 22:34:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj @KELLYWEILL hm but really you don't wish him well, or at least i usually don't
879104763647971332 2017-06-25 22:31:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald i read this because you tweeted it but tbh was quite disappointed
879094168571842560 2017-06-25 21:49:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale surprised they haven't demolished these yet
879093575010721792 2017-06-25 21:46:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz so following this line, should it be the states? the feds? both?
879092042357497856 2017-06-25 21:40:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kyla_kills @addysue @gabydvj nice popeyes box
879091867937374208 2017-06-25 21:40:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz your point being that regardless of the program, this shouldn't be an excuse to let the feds off the hook for funding?
879091137469968384 2017-06-25 21:37:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz right, but isn't the point of this basically to help fund policies cities couldn't otherwise afford to?
879090304497971200 2017-06-25 21:33:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i'm not totally sure what you mean. also, it's bloomberg! idk what else you expect

878825377594048512 2017-06-24 04:01:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BrockKeeling @plitter replies to this tweet so far indicate that they think this story is very thinly reported (which I also felt), doesn't address real issues
878813803466473472 2017-06-24 03:15:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus i've gotten some good responses/debunking stuff so far
878813541805019137 2017-06-24 03:14:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus yes, i felt skeptical and it seemed thinly reported. but i don't know much about SF so i wanted to see how folks felt

878795700296929280 2017-06-24 02:03:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> I don't want to know how much GQ paid him to go to SF for a week, interview 10 people, and do some googling about fires & real estate in SF
878793976886829056 2017-06-24 01:56:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> Did Ronson really need to include the story about Alex Nieto? We all know it, it's not v relevant to the story and it's heavy handed here
878793474761478144 2017-06-24 01:54:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie @transbay @tdfischer_ Yeah I had a feeling that was the case. Wooden multifam bldgs are way less common here so it's harder to burn something down

878445125252390912 2017-06-23 02:50:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danrivoli at least i'm assuming they walked to nostrand? or was it franklin?
878426757455646720 2017-06-23 01:37:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whet For the first time I am genuinely afraid for the future of local reporting here

878426153052241920 2017-06-23 01:34:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> How can you ensure that anyone is holding officials, developers, the folks in power accountable in New York City without local reporters?
878425813636579336 2017-06-23 01:33:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> We can't have local media companies that are constantly laying people off or making people so miserable that they flee

877197473630081024 2017-06-20 16:12:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schadenfraade @DavidKlion Most of our subway was built in 1904-1930, this is not a high bar
877197022595600384 2017-06-20 16:10:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schadenfraade @DavidKlion i mean i would hope so

877193687335407616 2017-06-20 15:57:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexYablon it's not the most efficient but it's the only way - FiDi and chinatown are too crazy and my office is pretty close to the water anyway
877193489834012673 2017-06-20 15:56:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexYablon you have to deal with tourists - it's not a perfect path in a lot of ways - but biking along the water is nice
877192935644827648 2017-06-20 15:54:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexYablon no never the brooklyn. i took the manhattan, turn maybe three times and then i'm on the bike path that goes along the waterfront
877192272164605952 2017-06-20 15:51:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexYablon the Q does not run very frequently. the 4/5 comes often during morning/evening rush
877192017243189248 2017-06-20 15:50:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexYablon i live in crown heights and can walk to the 4 train. and i work right near bowling green so its a pretty straight shot on the train
877190913214337024 2017-06-20 15:46:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> This timing assumes the trains are running normally, of course...
877190248664629248 2017-06-20 15:43:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> I biked to work for the first time in ages today because I didn't want to deal with the 4. Took longer than the subway would but was lovely

877150398368403457 2017-06-20 13:05:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple did you ever really consider it a news program
876954535897509889 2017-06-19 00:07:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @devin_mb Since your constituents are unlikely to complain about DOB not permitting fast enough
876953216692387840 2017-06-19 00:01:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @devin_mb Like maybe some places it's malicious but I think the bigger issue is that few in govt really care about it or sees it as their problem
876952919928700930 2017-06-19 00:00:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @devin_mb In NYC, funding is largely driven by mayoral policies, what city council members want. Typically none of those people will advocate for DOB
876952126529961984 2017-06-19 23:57:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @devin_mb Like you can fund more homeless shelters or more schools or you can fund more DOB staffers.
876951872707461120 2017-06-19 23:56:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @devin_mb I mean it's possible but I think in mid- to large cities it has less to do with NIMBYism and more to do with it simply not being a priority
876949091309293570 2017-06-19 23:45:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @devin_mb I would also wonder about current DOB staffing levels and complexity of zoning
876944830689140736 2017-06-19 23:28:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @devin_mb you also have to consider the amount of new construction each place has, the amount of corruption at play in the permitting process...
876944624069337088 2017-06-19 23:27:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @devin_mb i don't think correlation equals causation here
876929965052350468 2017-06-19 22:29:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat My young artist friend Caroline wrote that and I have never been more proudpic.twitter.com/dbMW24SqBc
876917782281146368 2017-06-19 21:41:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz this would never fly in new york
876916121999466496 2017-06-19 21:34:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz if not it just seems unnecessarily interventionist
876916022669971456 2017-06-19 21:34:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz so i wonder if the legislature would in fact guarantee more funding for the agencies that handle this work in order to expedite it
876915849084448768 2017-06-19 21:33:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz so the argument in NYC (and i assume other cities too) is that our DOB needs more funding if people want faster approvals

876862962941689856 2017-06-19 18:03:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @clocarus great piece but in defense of that antibiotics thing...i've been on them for a couple weeks (for acne) & they're def messing w/ my stomach
876861421014921219 2017-06-19 17:57:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber i think it might be if it's properly supervised? it's pretty common in lower manhattan

875045881703260161 2017-06-14 17:42:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also the video of the water gushing into the station (reflected in the train window) is incredible
875045298426568712 2017-06-14 17:40:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Sateesh_Daniel read the article! i don't write stuff so i can re-explain it on twitter. vacancy rate is slightly higher than in yrs past but not outrageous
875044801745432577 2017-06-14 17:38:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> I was 40 minutes late to an interview with a developer in Midtown this morning!https://twitter.com/Gothamist/status/875043009498406914

874864675103670272 2017-06-13 05:42:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danarubinstein @ndhapple Really? The building is huge, covers a lot of the block. I wonder what they'll put there
874841725801553920 2017-06-13 04:11:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danarubinstein i wonder what they're gonna do with the J Edgar Hoover building! that place is like my brutalist nightmare

874808747654336512 2017-06-13 02:00:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @aricwithan_a @DavidKlion also, per aric's point - historically northeastern bed-stuy was groped with  bushwick (as the "eastern district")http://www.brownstoner.com/neighborhood/bushwick/bushwick-brooklyn-81-beaver-st-william-ulmer-brewery-history/
874771699916558337 2017-06-13 23:33:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @aricwithan_a @DavidKlion fun! though in this part of BK (and probably others) I think it's making some big assumptions about bus arrival times
874761130467614720 2017-06-13 22:51:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion @aricwithan_a I live there and I disagree. It is gentrifying but that makes it no different from a lot of other parts of southern BK

874690505690542080 2017-06-13 18:10:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chelseaadelaine lol you mean when they ask "can you not be mean?" you would say no

874678355035140100 2017-06-13 17:22:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> Don't you love it when PR people tell you not to be mean? (When have I ever been mean??)
874677671552327680 2017-06-13 17:19:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ethanchiel where'd you go
874663970124292096 2017-06-13 16:25:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @StreetsblogNYC @nicolegelinas why does the pic seem to be covering the text in print??
874657394348961796 2017-06-13 15:59:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion i wonder if you're maybe missing my point, but it's ok
874656418141532160 2017-06-13 15:55:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion anyway it's not really worth arguing about, just my two cents as a local/real estate reporter who covered BK
874655723258609664 2017-06-13 15:52:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion basing your perceptions of BK on the real estate preferences of white gentrifiers is an odd and narrow view
874654975162449921 2017-06-13 15:49:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion lol i just wouldn't group bed-stuy into north BK. it was never an industrial neighborhood unlike the rest of the traditional north BK ones
874654795725983744 2017-06-13 15:48:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion and "South Brooklyn" is also a contentious name for different reasons....
874654280313176066 2017-06-13 15:46:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion ask someone who lives in bed-stuy what they think about it!
874653829249236993 2017-06-13 15:44:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion sorry but as someone who wrote about BK for years, it's just doesn't really make sense, geographically/culturally/neighborhood-wise
874652634225025024 2017-06-13 15:40:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @villagevoice @MaxRivlinNadler have you abandoned new york city yet
874652258654441473 2017-06-13 15:38:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion since bed-stuy/ clinton hill/fort greene are very much a part of the "brownstone belt" that defines much of southern brooklyn
874651739160547329 2017-06-13 15:36:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion i would have picked flushing and/or broadway, which are the traditional north/south BK boundaries
874651600945647616 2017-06-13 15:36:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion atlantic avenue is kind of an arbitrary boundary
874643854733004800 2017-06-13 15:05:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 my coworkers are speculating that the bees magically migrated 50 blocks from midtownhttp://observer.com/2017/06/swarm-of-bees-fifth-avenue-midtown-manhattan/

874613901236809728 2017-06-13 13:06:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlanaMassey cute! guess it depends on how often that train to albany runs by
874447987753324548 2017-06-12 02:07:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj @whynot_31 my roommate helped; she is much taller than me. it's up there because that's the only place i have room to store it
874447281126330372 2017-06-12 02:04:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj i need help getting it down
874445523251593216 2017-06-12 01:57:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC then why not just put it in
874442456321974272 2017-06-12 01:45:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> No doubt I will regret this in a couple hours/tomorrow

874121593370419200 2017-06-11 04:30:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> In '68, 10,000 city sanitation workers refused to collect garbage anywhere in the five boros for 9 days.http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/great-garbage-strike-1968-workers-walkout-1968-article-1.2517880

874031807737495554 2017-06-11 22:33:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy Also fwiw I did this mostly because I was coming up on my print deadline and in a jam! I think it's only the second time I've done that

873719963168755712 2017-06-10 01:54:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne clearly i should have worded this differently! i just meant having the flacks come up, not that they pitch me ON the app

872870657398374401 2017-06-08 17:39:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TenantNet this is a rude tweet because YIMBY is not a "neighborhood destruction alt-right." also Kushner doesn't own the observer anymore...

872840495529177097 2017-06-08 15:39:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion are you in park slope
872827734678007808 2017-06-08 14:48:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i think it might be somewhere in the range of 400-500K.
872826894814728192 2017-06-08 14:45:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i don't know and no one would comment. TRD has speculated in the past but they way the city assesses condos (and everything) is v complex
872825569087549440 2017-06-08 14:40:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik possibly. i don't really see a ton of 421-a condo units being built except in pretty cheap neighborhoods since assessed cap is so low
872824748400660480 2017-06-08 14:36:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ktlnflnngn @JacobGarchik are we talking about condos?

872564539157602304 2017-06-07 21:22:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @dahvnyc worth noting that the conference/panel portion of northside costs 600 DOLLARS and unlike the concerts you can't buy tix for individual ones
872545059572469760 2017-06-07 20:05:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat so i've heard! also i felt better once i read this and realized part of it is kinda nonsense latin http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/handmaids-tale-nolite-te-bastardes-carborundorum-origin-margaret-atwood

872527101290827776 2017-06-07 18:54:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Dear Twitter: have you seen any inflatable union rats around the streets of NYC this week? If so, where?
872514505430970368 2017-06-07 18:04:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> I got an apology call from the Port Authority press office; I think this is unprecedented tbh
872514131525500928 2017-06-07 18:02:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> also @emma_a_whitford/@DaveCoIon at Gothamist are great, as is @MaxRivlinNadler at @villagevoice, and @MaraGay at WSJ
872513427968847872 2017-06-07 17:59:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> in NYC, NYDN's city hall reporters @erinmdurkin @Jill_Jorgensen do great work. so does @GothamGazette and the folks at @CityAndStateNY
872512796730195970 2017-06-07 17:57:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> Idk it really depends on what you wanna know about! Politico and Politico NY do some of the best coverage.

872251894604996609 2017-06-06 00:40:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller @ltvsquad maybe the same guy! there is a guy who lives in the hell's basement dead end who has to be like 70 and just yells and swears.
872250803804930048 2017-06-06 00:36:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller you don't need to approach them but sometimes folks will yell at you from behind walls in the tunnel, or you'll walk by them
872249750837506048 2017-06-06 00:32:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller @ltvsquad aw are you talking about the elderly schizophrenic guy? he's totally harmless and clearly been there for many years at this point
872249618528178176 2017-06-06 00:31:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller they're not scary! a lot of times if they see you they'll say hi or tell you to be careful. there are still a few scattered around
872248112483618816 2017-06-06 00:25:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller Tzvi have you never met any of the mole people? or more charitably, the residents of the tunnel?
872246100157227008 2017-06-06 00:17:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller @ltvsquad he doesn't even own most of those anymore; he sold them to a bunch of different real estate companies
872244716489895936 2017-06-06 00:12:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller @ltvsquad it was just a joke!
872241003457130496 2017-06-06 23:57:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller @ltvsquad But re: Amtrak, you mean they sealed it before they started running active trains? You just mean the fencing and locking/sealing EE exits?
872240420478124032 2017-06-06 23:54:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller @ltvsquad No I know about that I meant you cutting the first hole
872233938714075136 2017-06-06 23:29:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller @ltvsquad Wow joe, this is impossible to fact check but I guess I'll take your word for it 
872184845946040320 2017-06-06 20:14:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ No, read the story
872179527698571265 2017-06-06 19:52:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nytimes @RosaGoldensohn @brendancheney Congrats Rosa!
872169983442395136 2017-06-06 19:15:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller i think that's kind of different since MTA has tried to seal South 4th a few times
872169833206624256 2017-06-06 19:14:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller also worth noting that the Nevins installation was also picked up by Gothamist, Curbed, maybe others, I don't remember
872143786494889985 2017-06-06 17:30:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @MosesNYC @tzvifiller The MTA is way more high strung than Amtrak. Also it's much easier to shut an unused tunnel than to worry about policing a large active one
872136725501530114 2017-06-06 17:02:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller also much love to michelle but untapped is not exactly a lot of exposure
872136149254504448 2017-06-06 17:00:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller think they'll care? I feel like if you went early on a wknd not a big deal. i'd be more concerned about running into workers taking it down
872134554768855040 2017-06-06 16:54:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @c_pichardo @DartDClark not big enough for midtown! is that part of the columbia campus up there?

872123055337852930 2017-06-06 16:08:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple Idk! Hacking? Some other weird Trump shit we don't know about? They're going to have to come up with something
872120130385440768 2017-06-06 15:56:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple none of these things really require a secure diplomatic channel!!
872119482180939777 2017-06-06 15:54:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple hanging the whole thing on 666 fifth seems like a jump to me and one that isn't necessarily well-supported
872119252723126272 2017-06-06 15:53:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple I guess it feels like CBS is not really acknowledging all the reasons the trump admin would want to establish the secure channel?
872117580944769025 2017-06-06 15:46:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Notably, NYT avoids drawing that link directlyhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/business/vnesheconombank-veb-bank-russia-trump-kushner.html
872112764113879045 2017-06-06 15:27:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> ...seems like a really dumb thing to do, even for Kush
872112640184725509 2017-06-06 15:27:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> Seems likely he was meeting with Gorkov for that purpose, but trying to establish the secure backchannel just to help his real estate biz...
872112091703988225 2017-06-06 15:25:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> Not sure I buy that Kushner was establishing a secure backchannel to Moscow just so he could get bailout for 666 5thhttp://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/was-kushner-seeking-russian-bailout-manhattan-building-congress-will-ask-n766801?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma
872107577148133380 2017-06-06 15:07:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur i admire your dedication! i want to freelance more but the reporting in my spare time is truly exhausting
872106786710577152 2017-06-06 15:03:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur this is also weirdly true even when you write all day
871935502873710592 2017-06-05 03:43:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC @vksmith like what if someone had gone into labor? had a heart attack? idk
871934245069049856 2017-06-05 03:38:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC @vksmith yeah what happened tonight was crazy! and i know they evacuate trains every once in a while; this was really unacceptable
871930874492792833 2017-06-05 03:24:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC Finally, someone else who understands
871909416978829312 2017-06-05 01:59:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman and given what happened, i wonder if they had cut power to this whole stretch, which would preclude running another train to get everyone...
871907182471770112 2017-06-05 01:50:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman which are I think spaced, ideally, every ~500-1000 feet in the tunnel
871906927135121409 2017-06-05 01:49:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman also most people wouldn't know this but they wouldn't even have to get all the way to the next station, just to the next emergency exit
871906547143716869 2017-06-05 01:48:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman anyway MTA has had evacuation procedures in place for decades. it happens. they know how to do it if it comes to that
871906035002462208 2017-06-05 01:46:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman also if there are that many passengers on the train i would hope people would help each other...
871905889489440769 2017-06-05 01:45:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman you've got track workers there! people can carry them or run a train on one of the other tracks to get them
871905336399196160 2017-06-05 01:43:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman and for what it's worth, even the third rail has a big cover on it so you it's not particularly easy to electrocute yourself
871904755890704385 2017-06-05 01:41:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman keeping people on a packed overheated train like that for an hour-plus seems more risky than having em walk the track for 10 minutes
871904563539869696 2017-06-05 01:40:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman It would depend on the distance. If they were within a block or two of the station this is honestly unacceptable.
871904253685751808 2017-06-05 01:39:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ethanchiel lol is a power failure and raging incompetence on our 110-year-old subway system worth of conspiracy theories?
871903872960405505 2017-06-05 01:37:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman I don't run signals for MTA. it might be doable since there is a big switch at West 4th but I can see why they wouldn't want to do to this
871903585285570565 2017-06-05 01:36:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman It is also pretty challenging to run a train in two directions like that during such a busy time and with no place to turn it around
871903234058846208 2017-06-05 01:35:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman If there aren't trains running in either direction the main risk is third rail. If you have someone directing people to avoid it, they will
871902873868808193 2017-06-05 01:33:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RWFreeman It's unsafe but the MTA has on occasion evacuated trains. With personnel directing people, I think it's generally a safe process
871902229640474629 2017-06-05 01:31:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> I don't think it's that long a stretch... couldn't they have halted train traffic in either direction and just had folks walk the track?
871901683357560832 2017-06-05 01:28:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> Why didn't MTA just evacuate this train? It's a busy stretch between W4 and Bway-Laf but would've been better than leaving everyone trappedhttps://twitter.com/ericuman/status/871892855320694784
871898306208780294 2017-06-05 01:15:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JodyShenn it is, but i think it's possibly more frustrating when you follow one beat closely since you know you can go deep and have the ability
871896263205191681 2017-06-05 01:07:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JodyShenn Yes but as this story notes, you have to constantly produce content your subscribers want! Doesn't leave you much time for research projects

869672204002181120 2017-05-30 21:49:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @natestorring it seems like the retail market - much like the high end of the residential market - is resetting itself after getting too hot
869671961521262592 2017-05-30 21:48:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @natestorring but i think a lot of big LLs here want national chains, and national chains are kind of retreating, so there's a disconnect right now
869671358262894593 2017-05-30 21:46:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @natestorring i think you're right that retail crisis is not as severe here as it is elsewhere because we have a really broad market

869574276931887105 2017-05-30 15:20:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin i was two months delinquent and navient reported it to the credit companies and my score dropped like 150 points. never happened before.

869407722491478017 2017-05-29 04:18:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz but it seems to be doing what it set out to do, which is get people who aren't v interested in this stuff more engaged in urban planning
869407356433698816 2017-05-29 04:17:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz it also spends time on infamous failed public housing elsewhere like pruitt-igoe, cabrini green etc that could've been focused on jacobs
869406187858657282 2017-05-29 04:12:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i wrote a thread about ithttps://twitter.com/thecitywanderer/status/869308256270913536
869405931888680960 2017-05-29 04:11:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz it's interesting but you will prob find it very familiar (and in some ways disappointing maybe) if you've read the Power Broker

869393645870493696 2017-05-29 03:22:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> I like how the Soviet architect equates capitalism w/ bad urban planning. Guess he didn't realize the Soviets did plenty of bad architecture
869393109209239552 2017-05-29 03:20:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you, like me, are interested in Jane Jacobs' time as a State Dept propagandist, The Atlantic has some tidbits https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-prophecies-of-jane-jacobs/501104/pic.twitter.com/G2Hc8IAqVL
869381567696818176 2017-05-29 02:34:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @noahmanskar lol the NYT review of this book is also not super complimentary
869381048479735808 2017-05-29 02:32:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly there was some of that in the first season too! since it's obviously in greenpoint and the landlady is batty etc. looking forward
869380567959293954 2017-05-29 02:30:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly is this season worth watching?
869380157546663937 2017-05-29 02:29:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> There were a lotta old white man urbanists/architecture critics, but some women (largely Jacobs' contemporaries) and a black woman architect
869379295369723904 2017-05-29 02:25:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Highlights from the interviews were RAMS, the old clip of Philip Johnson talking abt Moses, @builtbrooklyn, & the footage of Jacobs herself

869375059156234243 2017-05-29 02:09:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @noahmanskar i feel like this is rarely, if ever, discussed explicitly bc most of the high-profile discussion of Jacobs is from men, unfortunately
869374762191081473 2017-05-29 02:07:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @noahmanskar oof
869372556188553216 2017-05-29 01:59:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @noahmanskar And (at least I've always assumed) something of a hindrance to her career?

869365111395430401 2017-05-29 01:29:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> I mean isn't it crazy that before she wrote about the city she wrote American Russian-language propaganda distributed in the Soviet Union?
869363508932206593 2017-05-29 01:23:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> ...quit her job as a full time journalist to raise her children while her husband built his career as a successful architect
869362362033332224 2017-05-29 01:18:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> It also fails to touch on interesting details of her life, like her time as a propagandist for the State Department. Or the fact that she...
869360194089865220 2017-05-29 01:09:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> Half the movie is about Moses, who was an important character in her urban planning narrative but did not need that much air time
869359911104372738 2017-05-29 01:08:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> After seeing the film (which I enjoyed), I think the LAT columnist is def right. It doesnt really delve into her life much, unfortunately
869316851842646016 2017-05-29 22:17:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Damn I totally missed that Denis Johnson had died. Time to re-read Jesus' Sonhttps://twitter.com/NYTObits/status/869315176306286593

869311197543321601 2017-05-29 21:55:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj my mom recently texted me that she saw a TV news segment about jared kushner and eb-5 and how it lacked context and i felt so proud
869310041685463040 2017-05-29 21:50:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn the article makes a similar argument
869309375193731072 2017-05-29 21:48:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn so you've seen it and you agree?

869309211615875072 2017-05-29 21:47:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> Which is actually what I expected from talking to people about it...the idea that she is not compelling enough on her own without Moses
869308256270913536 2017-05-29 21:43:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm finally going to see the Jane Jacobs doc, even tho this LAT review says it gives too much screen time to Moseshttp://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-building-type-jane-jacobs-movie-20170416-story.html
869278054593462272 2017-05-29 19:43:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax @AnnaESanders so you mean his condescension is directed more toward young people in general than to women?

868864688628654082 2017-05-28 16:20:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ a lot of people like natural history museum but parts of it are kinda dated too
868864339020836864 2017-05-28 16:19:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ highly recommend the National Gallery. Hirshhorn is all sculpture, has a nice sculpture garden. Phillips Collection in Dupont is cool too
868863751105236992 2017-05-28 16:17:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ there is also a Building Museum! the interior looks super cool but i've never spent much time there
868863558624456704 2017-05-28 16:16:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ and if you want to see the newer Air & Space, you have to trek out to Dulles (it's called Udvar Hazy Museum)
868863351039946752 2017-05-28 16:15:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ highly recommend American Indian. it's relatively new and the architecture is cool. NAMH and the old Air & Space are pretty dated
868862995992018944 2017-05-28 16:14:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ yay i'm glad the fish market hasn't been evicted yet
868862671986323456 2017-05-28 16:12:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @ISANobody_ @MarketUrbanism i often feel like it's used to justify very high rents in older buildings that happen to be in a good location
868862356075491332 2017-05-28 16:11:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @ISANobody_ @SoBendito i don't know what's considered "trophy" in D.C. but everyone seems to know the trophy office properties in NYC bc they're the most $$
868861866365382656 2017-05-28 16:09:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @ISANobody_ @SoBendito yeah. "trophy" is Class A but Class A is not always trophy. it's not the most helpful designation
868824515362656256 2017-05-28 13:41:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> the development is not inherently negative but the way it's gone down has been pretty bad for nearly everyone involved
868824222856085506 2017-05-28 13:40:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> maybe! i think the removal of the auto shops has been poorly executed in a lot of ways and done without much thought for the folks affected
868671293268389888 2017-05-27 03:32:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC i know right??
868669912843202560 2017-05-27 03:27:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 there is also supposed to be housing but they're fighting about whether the mall should be built, since the Wilpons want to build that first
868666013222662144 2017-05-27 03:11:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> One auto worker who approached me and started chatting said the city will demolish another block of shops at the end of the summer
868665348559708160 2017-05-27 03:08:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> Clearly most of these folks can't afford to take a day off of work so their wives/girlfriends/children come to them. Very sweet.
868664926042238976 2017-05-27 03:07:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> I was in some of these properties before they were demo'd, many stood vacant for a few years. There used to be a few dozen auto shops here
868664633481146369 2017-05-27 03:06:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, crazy to see entire blocks of Willets Point leveled, after the city seized these properties through eminent domain to build a mallpic.twitter.com/AGEEpX8GK0

868655502556790784 2017-05-27 02:29:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @donewman @im_sinclair i guess some of the '64 worlds fair architecture was kinda googlie but i don't think this is. i agree its a lil brutalist
868653610028191744 2017-05-27 02:22:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller yeah they've had them for a while now
868653233736167424 2017-05-27 02:20:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Apparently the architect was Allan Gordon Lorimer, Chief of Bureau of Architecture at the NYC Dept of Public Workshttp://www.wnyc.org/story/123806-artist-and-architect-a-g-lorimer/
868652807179702276 2017-05-27 02:19:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> Because so many people were travelling by helicopter in the early 60s?? Robert Moses was such a grandiose weirdo.

862725253486825472 2017-05-11 17:45:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @YIMBY_Princeton i think if you're talking about property markets it's more succinct since each exit is a couple towns
862724604216922114 2017-05-11 17:42:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @YIMBY_Princeton except for commercial brokers i guess

862701380204716033 2017-05-11 16:10:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes honestly as long as your mailmen aren't idiots and they actually put your packages inside the building, it's not much of an issue

862700098823868417 2017-05-11 16:05:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> And obviously rents in doorman buildings have dropped because the luxury market in general has softened

862401724853649414 2017-05-10 20:19:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> Bloomberg dropped that  into the story really matter-of-factly and without attribution even tho it's not something a developer would admit

860991664726437889 2017-05-06 22:56:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nandelabra You literally spent time in one of the only two air AC rooms in all of Coles. Main gym/stretching area was not, most practice rooms weren't

860948564792553477 2017-05-06 20:05:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_alexweinberg Also no mainstream outlet would intentionally lower their standards to match breitbart's or infowars' non-existent ones. Then everyone loses
860947749944119296 2017-05-06 20:01:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_alexweinberg lazy reporting =/= intentional bias. There may have been intentional bias in the original source but this is just reblogging wo factchecking
860944478810591232 2017-05-06 19:48:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_alexweinberg Yeah but when the MSM or "left-leaning" outlets do stuff like this they are giving right-wing pubs the ammo to drag them
860932396656586752 2017-05-06 19:00:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_alexweinberg it's an issue of professional standards. journalists have professional ethics and standards, just like engineers do.
860930801877340162 2017-05-06 18:54:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_alexweinberg There are plenty of true and accurate reasons to oppose this bill and those deserve coverage, not semi-factual stuff based on anecdotes
860930535304069123 2017-05-06 18:53:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_alexweinberg What do you mean who cares if it's true? The journalists writing these posts should care since otherwise they're spreading misinformation
860922031298281472 2017-05-06 18:19:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> Guess we can file this one under "maybe someone should have actually read a draft of the bill"
860921911630598144 2017-05-06 18:19:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> Sigh https://twitter.com/LaurenFCarroll/status/860903934206017536
860903192703401986 2017-05-06 17:04:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexCKaufman yes they are fundraising through EB-5. and they are using the same migration agent company that arranged the EB-5 $$ for subway wifi
860902180257239040 2017-05-06 17:00:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> I guess that explains how they paid for it "at no cost to taxpayers"
860901432010178560 2017-05-06 16:57:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> TIL the company that did NYC's subway wifi used $75 million in Chinese EB-5 money to help fund the $300M project http://nycrc.com/project.html?id=3
860542859296071680 2017-05-05 17:13:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> I've never been more soaked than I am right now, after arguing with the guards at City Hall for 20 mins to let me in to cover a presser
860513249858596865 2017-05-05 15:15:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca hm why do you think it's better than just washing your face

860512444975894530 2017-05-05 15:12:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca do you double cleanse? or do you just do exactly what they tell you to do?
860505444669849601 2017-05-05 14:44:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> Update: one of my coworkers told me he's known two people who died from hitting their heads, so that's great

860095302031859712 2017-05-04 11:34:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull supposedly in VA you don't have to be a member of party in order to vote in that party's primary but idk if all the poll workers know that
860094047775592448 2017-05-04 11:29:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull wow this is fascinating about the voter registration in GA. so people don't register with parties/there aren't separate primaries?

859225164768133121 2017-05-01 01:56:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj recently they were asking me "what advice would you have for current students?" and for some reason i found that really funny

859129337685168128 2017-05-01 19:36:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber @Jesselansner yes it is truly one of the worst places in the city, even compared to the Atlantic Ave target
859128404997804032 2017-05-01 19:32:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner @akgerber i think they are much smarter at opening in cities than Kmart has been

858888194397532160 2017-04-30 03:37:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sanasaleem it will go thru a second round of edits tomorrow so i know my editors will help me with organization (hopefully w/o tearing it up too much)
858887697074724868 2017-04-30 03:35:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just had to rewrite/reorganize a feature and i think it's worse than when i started

858818644343762952 2017-04-30 23:01:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar could be this http://www.yimbynews.com/2015/08/reveal-for-17-story-134-unit-mixed-use-building-at-810-river-avenue-south-bronx.html
858818479859879936 2017-04-30 23:00:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar maybe, i need more context. jerome where? is it south of the stadium? and are you sure it's not on river or gerard ave?

858792350084206594 2017-04-30 21:17:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne @DavidKlion also in all this they still refuse to address the issue of why they don't hire a more diverse slate of op-ed columnists...
858792038522925057 2017-04-30 21:15:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne @DavidKlion though i guess the generation of reader that cares about NYT op-eds are basically the same people who make decisions in our gov't, so....
858791251038097408 2017-04-30 21:12:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne @DavidKlion yeah that's the crux of it for me, more than whether or not op-eds are important (i think they are for a certain generation/age of reader)

858358810385231874 2017-04-29 16:34:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca SA is more of a slow & steady wins the race thing. not always miraculous but helps heal zits and doesn't turn my face into sandpaper like BP

858093237743091712 2017-04-28 22:59:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> The moral of the story is, I guess, that no one wants to pay to develop office buildings on the Red Hook waterfront
858092999653326851 2017-04-28 22:58:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> And then I found new renderings for the now-aborted office development in 2015 http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/09/est4te-fours-big-red-hook-office-development-gets-new-renderings.html
858092900273541120 2017-04-28 22:57:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> I was excited about this because I've been following this story since I broke news about them buying it in 2014 http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2014/10/est4te-four-buys-up-more-red-hook-warehouses-plans-office-conversions/

858041848555810817 2017-04-28 19:34:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BenDWalsh @cushac @AlexCKaufman @mcwm i'm a big fan of Transmitter Park though. extremely good but small park

858040777884225536 2017-04-28 19:30:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BenDWalsh @cushac @mcwm @AlexCKaufman greenpoint has the added bonus of being expensive, transit-starved, and an entire superfund site

857073492705062912 2017-04-25 03:26:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bfishbfish @vksmith "artist"?
857050531793174528 2017-04-25 01:55:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EmilyNonko @plitter the latter, which was part of the reason this controversy has played out the way it has

856973884003889152 2017-04-25 20:51:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> Extremely important dispatch from @rachelholliday on the Prospect Park goat beathttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170425/prospect-lefferts-gardens/goat-herd-prospect-park-grass-eating

856958647464857602 2017-04-25 19:50:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly just noticed your new twitter bio has a typo in it
856954642483347456 2017-04-25 19:34:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> $50 for 1200 words is genuinely offensive, especially from a print pubhttps://twitter.com/gabydvj/status/856953412759339008
856954187476860932 2017-04-25 19:32:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Clarii_D @2AvSagas yeah i saw! I'm gonna read that one too
856953239685779456 2017-04-25 19:29:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> Really loving this WNYC series on interesting neighborhood projects, like the city's 1st community garden on Houstonhttps://project.wnyc.org/design-by-community/?page=nyc-first-community-garden#!/nyc-first-community-garden
856898113809911808 2017-04-25 15:50:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Thought of this while reading @KonradPutzier's rundown of LeFrak's & Roth's comments on infrastructure councilhttps://therealdeal.com/2017/04/25/lefrak-roth-dish-on-trumps-lofty-infrastructure-goals/
856897342599036929 2017-04-25 15:47:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> When I asked LeFrak for details on Trump's infrastructure council, he said, "If I didn't tell WSJ, I'm definitely not telling you"
856891357163646977 2017-04-25 15:23:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @MarketUrbanism they're getting the CONH which i think any buyer should expect and require
856891144147521536 2017-04-25 15:22:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday if i were gonna buy this house, i would make it a condition of the sale that the owner get the CONH. otherwise, it could be a money pit
856890313994055685 2017-04-25 15:19:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday lol $2 million and they couldn't even change the C of O?
856885315386179584 2017-04-25 14:59:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen did you work for a local paper there?
856884013776207872 2017-04-25 14:54:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz what do you think
856883863062237185 2017-04-25 14:53:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> And Chicago had the biggest increase in Latino homeownership. Fascinatinghttps://twitter.com/DCist/status/856883574523473921
856677617096953860 2017-04-24 01:13:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj gross
856674648540499970 2017-04-24 01:02:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> The East Harlem rezoning entered ULURP today, which means it will finish before the Speaker leaves office.https://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/24/15412066/east-harlem-rezoning-ulurp-launch
856655807848513537 2017-04-24 23:47:15 UTC <ChappellTracker> Y'all it takes so much time, resources and approval to get content posted on government websites. Things don't just get posted accidentally.
856585403712888833 2017-04-24 19:07:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYDailyNews @jangelooff copy desk is having quite a day
856562008468094980 2017-04-24 17:34:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller there were a lot of problems... franklin, eastern parkway, nevins
856557055359975424 2017-04-24 17:14:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller i survived with much stress
856507628167593984 2017-04-24 13:58:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> I had a 10 am interview with a city council member! Oh well
856506207858774017 2017-04-24 13:52:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm going to die on this 3 train in Brooklyn
856485321281855490 2017-04-24 12:29:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale lol whatever. They fund a lot of affordable housing and big economic development projects
856484394772639746 2017-04-24 12:26:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale Not gonna defend Goldman but do you know what its urban investment group does?
856348503643222020 2017-04-23 03:26:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism OTOH some of the economic development and jobs things have been positive and helped folks launch businesses etc. housing, not so much
856348021092646914 2017-04-23 03:24:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson what are you referring to?
856347505591803904 2017-04-23 03:22:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism as for the rezonings, at this point they're being slowed down for political reasons which isn't necessarily her fault
856347347424608257 2017-04-23 03:21:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism lol i don't flack for the city, it's not my job to defend her. BQX was always a disaster...
856278067345596416 2017-04-23 22:46:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism he's not allowed to be involved anymore, legally. he's no longer the owner since it's in a trust
856277932687450112 2017-04-23 22:45:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism I talked a little bit of shit about him in one of my entries actually! we don't have to worry about that stuff anymore
856277399943737349 2017-04-23 22:43:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> It is fun to use interviews for our Power 100 list as an opportunity to argue about petty beat reporter things I covered in my previous jobs
856273683559657472 2017-04-23 22:28:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie yes, as the teens like to say
856273583450050560 2017-04-23 22:28:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism but also no recent C of O on file so.... there could be something interesting going on
856272675110629376 2017-04-23 22:24:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Maybe when I'm not trying to help put out a 165-page paper I will look up whether this is an SRO
856270271791190016 2017-04-23 22:15:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> Everylot catches a Harlem bando (tho the attached building on the right is in perfect shape)https://twitter.com/everylotnyc/status/856269737944375296
856269854625730560 2017-04-23 22:13:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @smithsj lol
856269497426219009 2017-04-23 22:12:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @smithsj no. i don't typically eat a ton of meat but i'm not vegetarian
856269180651413508 2017-04-23 22:10:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj @alon_levy also more generally i think not eating dairy forces me to eat healthier
856267487876333569 2017-04-23 22:04:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj @alon_levy nope, that's way too much work. i just cut out dairy bc i heard it would help my acne (it also eliminated some lingering stomach problems)
856267201342578689 2017-04-23 22:03:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj you know i don't miss it much really. it's better for my stomach and my skin. cutting out cheese was harder than butter
856265364321312768 2017-04-23 21:55:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj i don't use butter anymore (I cut out dairy) so fortunately this isn't an issue for me
856255175157305346 2017-04-23 21:15:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa @DaveCoIon @MattRobare i mean yes but also clearly that was not the only motivation to torch your own building for insurance money
856253214559227904 2017-04-23 21:07:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> it me
856252250209099777 2017-04-23 21:03:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa @DaveCoIon @MattRobare i can't tell if you're joking or not
856248661268992000 2017-04-23 20:49:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon @ChrisLInoa Did you never finish it?
856246553970958336 2017-04-23 20:41:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon @ChrisLInoa
856243418942631937 2017-04-23 20:28:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, people who watched The Get Down: doesn't that background look familiar?!
856242224543268864 2017-04-23 20:23:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @khariparson yes, and i think much of that weird photoshopped background in that scene was pulled from old koch ads/archival news footage
856236336281526275 2017-04-23 20:00:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> This '81 Ed Koch campaign ad about the South Bronx is sort of nice but also pretty canned/stilted soundinghttps://therealdeal.com/2017/04/23/the-south-bronx-is-coming-back-1981-edition-video/
856230486829670401 2017-04-23 19:37:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand i suspect more people are just moving there and the # of new apartments being built isn't really keeping up
856229619359469569 2017-04-23 19:33:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand i don't think that's exactly true on average but i think it's just a function of astoria gentrifying and getting a lot of $$ new rentals
856228071837446144 2017-04-23 19:27:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urbaninsideout most coverage of JKush's real estate  does that! but yes 666 Fifth in particular. it's like that story of him buying property in dumbo
856226107779166209 2017-04-23 19:19:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urbaninsideout i just meant delightful like funny
856221427195928584 2017-04-23 19:01:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @stevecuozzo And the cigar club is still there and costs $7500 to join plus $325 per month!

856220017058250756 2017-04-23 18:55:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> I finally read @stevecuozzo's history of 666 Fifth Avenue and it is delightful http://nypost.com/2017/04/18/the-scandalous-history-behind-kushners-ritzy-midtown-building/pic.twitter.com/9pcMXh8fz8
856214224623763456 2017-04-23 18:32:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KaylaEpstein i take them in NYC all the time! the WMATA buses are particularly bad and unreliable in the suburbs, which is where i usually took them
856213467912601600 2017-04-23 18:29:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KaylaEpstein also the lack of free transfers between WMATA bus and metro is unacceptable
856212999144603651 2017-04-23 18:27:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KaylaEpstein all of my worst bus experiences were WMATA bus experiences
856212916646838277 2017-04-23 18:27:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KaylaEpstein sorry no
856212818068221954 2017-04-23 18:26:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism i've only been to wakefield so i didn't really know

856199410438594560 2017-04-23 17:33:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra @im_sinclair it faces the roadway tho so you have to be on that side to really see it
856199104124379137 2017-04-23 17:32:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra @im_sinclair its been up for several months i think
856195400637788162 2017-04-23 17:17:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> NYT Metro writing about Jamaican beef patties in the far northern Bronx (Wakefield) gives me hopehttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/nyregion/kingston-tropical-bakery-wakefield-bronx-jamaican-patties.html?em_pos=small&emc=edit_ur_20170423&nl=nytoday&nlid=76293986&ref=headline&mtrref=undefined

856184976655736832 2017-04-23 16:36:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra i recently interviewed the head of toll brothers city living and he sounded very tired while talking about that project, lol
856183873520242688 2017-04-23 16:31:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra hm what do you think of the weird brown tile facade that faces the BQE? and apparently those condos are selling well

855496945409949697 2017-04-21 19:02:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @kvelsey "Ms Reagan and her apartment have finally broken up." that's pretty good
855493831558615042 2017-04-21 18:49:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kvelsey @MarketUrbanism shocked that the House that Organ Trading Bought is not considered your magnum opus

855281691757223936 2017-04-20 04:47:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> I think my new list of media career advice is -Mute the men you've slept with on twitter -Ask for more money -Learn to write punny headlines
855267691812093953 2017-04-20 03:51:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie the by-right proposal is also half the units and less than half the height. the dev has a lot of incentive to move forward with the rezoning
855265731696627712 2017-04-20 03:43:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie also they said they plan to resubmit
855265503916548097 2017-04-20 03:42:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie they have a point. with 565 apartments it wouldn't kill them to add more affordable housing

855255586774102016 2017-04-20 03:03:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_alexweinberg oh it's just one building with two towers, 16 stories, 522 units, 105 affordable ones. i'm writing a thing about Two Trees right now lol
855253155147382784 2017-04-20 02:53:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_alexweinberg but yes 2800 apartments per the latest press release

855249206331789313 2017-04-20 02:37:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @aedwardslevy @AlexJamesFitz @ryanbeckwith i have been following alex for years, just followed ariel
855248626100183040 2017-04-20 02:35:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson considering this deal predates MIH by years, the mayor is lucky he even got any affordable housing. i don't think two trees had to do any
855246015879925760 2017-04-20 02:25:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple also terence was just extremely punny
855245852843048965 2017-04-20 02:24:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i mean obviously we are not THAT pun-happy but the Observer tradition apparently involves tabloid-style puns in print
855245164964700161 2017-04-20 02:21:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson That ship has extremely sailed unfortunately
855244269824737281 2017-04-20 02:18:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> These renderings for the Domino Sugar Factory park look great; I was excited to find them in my email this afternoonhttp://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/20/15374292/domino-williamsburg-waterfront-park
855244002295250948 2017-04-20 02:17:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner can't give away my stories!
855243268753371136 2017-04-20 02:14:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 i've come close enough times
855242837704802304 2017-04-20 02:12:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 you're lucky i don't block you for this tweet
855242462293614592 2017-04-20 02:11:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> the guy who used to have my job could fit three puns about de Blasio being tall into a one-sentence lede
855241715447459840 2017-04-20 02:08:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn i have basically zero pun skills
855241330162847744 2017-04-20 02:06:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> My EIC, a longtime veteran of the NY Post, can come up with them without even thinking
855241060246835200 2017-04-20 02:05:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> I suspect this is a problem unique to tabloid-style New York papers
855240632453017600 2017-04-20 02:03:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> I never thought I'd say this, but now that I have to write corny headlines and captions for print, I wish I had those terrible pun skills

855229078718341122 2017-04-20 01:17:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @turbotax @nandelabra for that, sounds like you could have just hired an accountant and saved money
855228832177164289 2017-04-20 01:16:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @turbotax @nandelabra jesus. how many states did you file in?
855225097023520768 2017-04-20 01:02:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nandelabra turbotax is such a ripoff for what it is
855224475821932545 2017-04-20 00:59:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> I've been working so much the last couple weeks that I forgot to file my taxes or an extension
855194169417007105 2017-04-20 22:59:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bfishbfish @DaveCoIon @ethanchiel @KELLYWEILL i'm still at work so i might just go to the bar anyway, w/e
855192706246639616 2017-04-20 22:53:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad hm ok. yeah when i went to one of those L train shutdown meetings in (i think?) Feb or March they claimed an initial plan was coming soon
855192165097635840 2017-04-20 22:51:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad no doubt
855191727526875136 2017-04-20 22:49:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad when i spoke to DOT they made it sound like they were releasing an initial plan in the spring (so soon i guess?)
855190791207231489 2017-04-20 22:45:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad they also talked about increased bus and ferry service
855189456520957952 2017-04-20 22:40:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad i wouldn't say that they have no plan but they havent' released a final one
855188779765772294 2017-04-20 22:37:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad they've been doing public meetings for months to develop one and discussed their potential plans
855170034431295493 2017-04-20 21:23:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bfishbfish @DaveCoIon @KELLYWEILL is it possible to come to media drinks and watch hockey simultaneously
855169149680709632 2017-04-20 21:19:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bfishbfish @KELLYWEILL @DaveCoIon lame
855168588910559238 2017-04-20 21:17:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bfishbfish @DaveCoIon @KELLYWEILL I will prob come if I can emerge from my mountain of work
855167500224532480 2017-04-20 21:13:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, The City Record is extremely annoying to navigate
855167348654960642 2017-04-20 21:12:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> But it does kinda seem like they are using a favorably large square footage in order to make their per square foot rent seem lower
855167176684261377 2017-04-20 21:11:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> HRA still has not given me a good answer for why the building is supposedly 288,000 square feet and they claim it's 350,000
855167007565676544 2017-04-20 21:11:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> So this got very involved, but the HRA renewed its huge Union Square office space for (probably?) $45 a square foothttps://commercialobserver.com/2017/04/human-resources-administration-109-east-16th-street-gould-investors-lease/
855148893725749249 2017-04-20 19:59:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Update: I sort of fucked this up because I found some new info, so I'm fixing the story and taking down these tweets!
855144590168526848 2017-04-20 19:42:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> Big h/t to @stevecuozzo for spotting this weird situation with HRA office space back in Novemberhttp://nypost.com/2016/11/22/hra-paying-skyscraper-prices-for-bare-bones-office-building/
855122369769336832 2017-04-20 18:13:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @miller_stephen But you're morning about things on twitter from France so it's ok
855076104931086337 2017-04-20 15:10:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @molly__o it inspired me to read the Time 100 which was a laugh
855072694357897216 2017-04-20 14:56:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@molly__o's write-around profile of Wendi Deng is delightfulhttp://fusion.net/meet-wendi-deng-the-evil-genius-who-hangs-with-ivanka-1793861207

854810933549551621 2017-04-19 21:36:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik i'm sure it's not long for this world
854763319198187520 2017-04-19 18:27:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism he got a rezoning as part of the neighborhood wide rezoning in 2012
854760510260117505 2017-04-19 18:16:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale Sadly I didn't ask
854758006927523847 2017-04-19 18:06:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also he gave me cool renderings of his new construction and expansion projects, which is always a pluspic.twitter.com/U1ng1QlSLi
854757597794140162 2017-04-19 18:04:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> Realistically, most people who buy abandoned industrial buildings in gentrifying hoods knock them down. It takes $$ and patience to preserve
854756805183983616 2017-04-19 18:01:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's definitely unusual to find a landlord who is loved by the local community board & their tenants, is preserving historic properties...
854756126428102668 2017-04-19 17:58:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i got distracted in between these tweetshttps://twitter.com/thecitywanderer/status/854755278037843974
854755278037843974 2017-04-19 17:55:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> I profiled a developer who's converting vacant Harlem factories to offices, offering free space to artists/activistshttps://commercialobserver.com/2017/04/meet-scott-metzner-the-developer-whos-transforming-industrial-west-harlem/
854749547490402304 2017-04-19 17:32:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm not a fan of what most developers are doing in gentrifying neighborhoods, but I interviewed one in Harlem recently who impressed me...
854723890198827009 2017-04-19 15:50:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> Excited to read @reym12's 4,300-word opus on Paul Massey's mayoral campaignhttps://commercialobserver.com/2017/04/paul-massey-takes-on-de-blasio-long-odds-with-mayoral-bid/
854544265791381504 2017-04-18 03:56:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Whitewillow64 very similar story with 50 west, if you've covered that building
854543745223667712 2017-04-18 03:54:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Whitewillow64 oh i skipped over that pargraph. yeah i guess so but after all is said and done i bet he lost more money than he's making back now
854542350722506752 2017-04-18 03:49:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Whitewillow64 it was started during the recession and was nearly a failure that didn't finish constructionhttps://therealdeal.com/2016/05/11/after-years-of-delays-56-leonard-can-now-begin-closings/
854539950502621185 2017-04-18 03:39:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Whitewillow64 it's kind of funny to call it a success story
854509826717646850 2017-04-18 01:39:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik the Long Lines building is all right though
854509576250634246 2017-04-18 01:38:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i recently interviewed a partner at KPF (Eugene Kohn) who worked for that architect, John Carl Warnecke, early in his career
854509291478417408 2017-04-18 01:37:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik ugh this building is a fucking eyesore
854508697925677057 2017-04-18 01:35:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik bizarre
854508017387261952 2017-04-18 01:32:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik yes i guess that is one of its redeeming qualities
854506414248689665 2017-04-18 01:26:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik do you think woodhull is brutalist or just horrible
854505933141135360 2017-04-18 01:24:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik Medgar Evers is definitely not brutalist, but the high school is a bit ugly
854505383175610368 2017-04-18 01:22:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik there is a bed-stuy police station that is similar...by marcy projects on bedford i believe
854505236165218304 2017-04-18 01:21:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik ugh i hate this development, it is very unattractive and i doubt it qualifies as brutalist. but i guess you're right, police & fire stations
854503716732448768 2017-04-18 01:15:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik are there even any BK brutalist buildings? maybe enough to count on one hand?
854503470711361537 2017-04-18 01:14:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik Brooklyn specifically? idk if we have much brutalism. maybe citywide brutalism
854503311386570752 2017-04-18 01:13:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik yes i really want to go the pics of the ceiling are incredible https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzludzha#/media/File:Buzludzha_Monument_Auditorium.jpg
854502402862583809 2017-04-18 01:10:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik there's tons of amazing abandoned stuff like this in eastern europe, i really need to go
854493855835717632 2017-04-18 00:36:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik I need to start an abandoned brutalism photo project
854454972003618817 2017-04-18 22:01:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> "The parts of these programs that are functioning well  and that are maintaining people  are going to be preserved." Will they though?

854408273746907140 2017-04-18 18:56:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart @HenryGrabar OTOH retail in the outer boroughs is doing extremely well because there is less of it https://www.rebny.com/content/rebny/en/research/REBNYRetailReport/Winter_2017_Brooklyn_Retail_Report.html
854406744428228608 2017-04-18 18:50:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart @HenryGrabar are we? i think we are often an indicator of what's going to happen in other expensive cities
854404543139991552 2017-04-18 18:41:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart @kittertwitty hm i'm not sure which one you mean
854404482599444483 2017-04-18 18:41:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar @jblumgart clearly it will be worse in the burbs but NYC retail people are not exactly optimistic either...https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-08/vornado-s-roth-sees-chance-to-feed-on-the-carnage-in-retail
854404112410136576 2017-04-18 18:39:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @untermyer many people are fans, i am not
854403029541556233 2017-04-18 18:35:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar @jblumgart agree
854402889049157633 2017-04-18 18:34:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart @HenryGrabar now that i cover this my general feeling is that retail is not doing so hot in big cities either
854401929497194498 2017-04-18 18:31:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> This reminds me that I hate most (all of?) D.C.'s brutalist architecturehttps://twitter.com/jblumgart/status/854385441235251203
854400145139609601 2017-04-18 18:24:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart @HenryGrabar well it's certainly a step above the watergate, which is also circular and horribly brutalist and nearby
854398340133507072 2017-04-18 18:16:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart except for the Hirshhorn, they are all pretty badhttp://dc.curbed.com/maps/map-brutalist-architecture-washington-dc
854393734384975872 2017-04-18 17:58:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart this is like 70% of gov't buildings in D.C.
854054077117997056 2017-04-17 19:28:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen i think will still does that (or at least i see him here late doing something...)
854053675861495809 2017-04-17 19:27:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen i don't care about my daily copy but cutting a feature i really cared about to fit a page was a struggle
854053224420188160 2017-04-17 19:25:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber yes i live an exciting life
854052298309459968 2017-04-17 19:21:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Update: cutting 150-200 words from this story was painful. how did i get to this point in my life
854041934867943425 2017-04-17 18:40:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith yup. i think the tabs do a lot of great work but they also like to stoke a lot of that gentrification fear
854041169163993089 2017-04-17 18:37:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith yes, exactly the same, possibly worse in the bronx since many of those . communities are still largely low income
854040159217758209 2017-04-17 18:33:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> I spent 15 minutes on the phone w/ one local leader convincing her that I was not, in fact, writing one before she was willing to talk to me
854039772888694784 2017-04-17 18:32:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> I've written two features on Harlem in past week and people are scared to talk bc they're worried I'm doing a negative gentrification story

853457260714000384 2017-04-15 03:57:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV not sure when this new layout launched but i like it better
853455786642722817 2017-04-15 03:51:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj did i tell you about how i discovered the Church of Scientology owns two buildings on east 125th in Harlem? relatively recent purchases too
853451017605742592 2017-04-15 03:32:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ Yes. I think I'm getting close to it. Depends on the layout, which I think can hold 2500-3000 words total (2-3 pages)
853449547128995841 2017-04-15 03:26:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Update: it's basically finished and nearly 2,200 words 
853315077239341057 2017-04-15 18:32:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mekosoff @schadenfraade there must be an editor at citylab who would consider this
853270885754712064 2017-04-15 15:36:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj i'm ok with treadmills/ellipticals but stairmasters and stationary bikes truly bore me to tears. and i had knee problems for a long time...
853270529196904448 2017-04-15 15:35:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj do squats instead!
853270425333354496 2017-04-15 15:34:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj stairmaster isn't great for your knees anyway
853266868949454848 2017-04-15 15:20:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito he doesn't even use email
853266056348975104 2017-04-15 15:17:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito because he's so responsive

852937783270395904 2017-04-14 17:33:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> Honestly at this point I'm wondering which WTC contractors weren't involved with the mobhttp://nypost.com/2017/04/12/contractor-i-hid-mob-ties-to-land-hefty-wtc-contract/
852935483994902529 2017-04-14 17:24:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GwynneFitz @nickr15 @pauldebenedetto i think @ThorntonMcEnery enjoyed using crain's to troll us
852933041886556160 2017-04-14 17:14:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GwynneFitz but we can write a real estate trend story about it!!! lol
852921503255605248 2017-04-14 16:28:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart truth
852920670799441921 2017-04-14 16:25:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa I know but it's never worth the arrest....
852920369501622273 2017-04-14 16:23:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also I don't know why anyone ever speaks to journalists on the record about this stuff..
852919734425276416 2017-04-14 16:21:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's adorable that Motherboard reblogged Sunnyside Post and that people are still treating subway surfing as novelhttps://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-instagrams-subway-surfing-daredevils
852914873671573505 2017-04-14 16:02:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @InTheMkts @joeanuta @MarketUrbanism I think he might just be waiting for a stronger market
852911789130096641 2017-04-14 15:49:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter i miss the bus basically every time; i am horrible at time management and the 7 train to HY hates me
852910897832099840 2017-04-14 15:46:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter literally any time i have had to take the bus from 34th and 11th, i have been late and angry
852910105003773953 2017-04-14 15:43:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @InTheMkts @joeanuta true, that might be a reason to wait if he thinks it will mean better financing. the resi situation on 125th is kind of weird
852908930539847681 2017-04-14 15:38:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @InTheMkts @joeanuta 125th was rezoned in '08! the current east harlem rezoning doesn't go that far north; it wouldn't affect his site
852908352225124353 2017-04-14 15:36:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @InTheMkts @joeanuta they're just fighting over the proceeds of the sale, not the site itself, right?
852907925123338240 2017-04-14 15:34:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @InTheMkts @joeanuta I don't know! maybe barnett is just being slow and waiting for the market to get a little stronger, which seems to be the consensus
852905758077407234 2017-04-14 15:25:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @InTheMkts The conflict is still going on! @joeanuta covered a second lawsuit filed last monthhttp://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170324/REAL_ESTATE/170329914/east-harlem-pathmark-site-brings-more-legal-trouble-for-abyssinian-development-corp
852903648132820993 2017-04-14 15:17:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @InTheMkts I wonder if this lawsuit over the Pathmark is the reason Gary Barnett hasn't developed the site yet?pic.twitter.com/xEtiKep4sv
852903382759215105 2017-04-14 15:16:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> Still learning about Harlem politics & real estate.

852891636317204480 2017-04-14 14:29:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa how is it
852750533332844545 2017-04-13 05:09:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel @alon_levy i mean trying and failing to reach sources eight times a day
852750272459792384 2017-04-13 05:08:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BayCity_Beacon @Mottel @alon_levy once a week sounds nice
852749905353363458 2017-04-13 05:06:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel @alon_levy now do that like eight times a day! welcome to journalism!
852749449436602368 2017-04-13 05:04:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel @alon_levy right now i work with a rigorous editor who's great but we often have to talk to everyone involved in a story and it's quite time consuming
852748622265438208 2017-04-13 05:01:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel @alon_levy do you do it every day? do you talk to everyone you source? do you have an editor crawling up your butt about the style and deadlines?
852748395106115587 2017-04-13 05:00:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel @alon_levy and obviously sometimes you write more than one piece a day, just depends. and daily posts have to be reported, often involve a few calls
852747777528406016 2017-04-13 04:58:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel @alon_levy no one is writing 1,200 word blog posts (at least i hope not). short daily 300-500 word pieces, heavily reported 1500-2200 word features
852746392493629440 2017-04-13 04:52:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel yes
852746200662949889 2017-04-13 04:51:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> I only close a paper once a week how do you daily newspaper people deal with this
852745897846775808 2017-04-13 04:50:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel the long features are hard to manage time wise
852745843950075904 2017-04-13 04:50:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel daily reporting and also having to do long features for the weekly paper is kind of hard so far
852745028170506241 2017-04-13 04:47:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> Me: Being in print seems cool Also me: hysterically turning in copy before print deadline and wondering if my editors are going to murder me
852742965352988672 2017-04-13 04:39:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader i will buy this house with you
852681382358917120 2017-04-13 00:34:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Really nice piece from Rachel about neighbors in Prospect Heights embracing a new women's shelterhttps://twitter.com/rachelholliday/status/852616218905378817

852672285806919681 2017-04-13 23:58:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito Hi Ben
852671773636263936 2017-04-13 23:56:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @fusion @emmaroller Congrats!!
852660095934713856 2017-04-13 23:09:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SeanMcElwee @KELLYWEILL @DaveCoIon What time are you coming?
852647056246222848 2017-04-13 22:17:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brennangriffin @ndhapple however, in mid-range neighborhoods with more affordable rents (like in BK and Queens) i think rents are still going up in general
852645005403373568 2017-04-13 22:09:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brennangriffin @ndhapple many real estate folks say that the market is "soft" right now for $$ development bc of financing/other factors, and rents are responding
852642851171250176 2017-04-13 22:01:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brennangriffin @ndhapple i think it's fair to say rents are stable or declining slightly in many of the most expensive neighborhoods bc lots of high-end inventory
852642557632884737 2017-04-13 22:00:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brennangriffin @ndhapple honestly it's really hard to generalize across the entire city and across all price points. it's going up in some places and down in others
852626310560174081 2017-04-13 20:55:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sidfernando @BklynBckstretch @KetaHagen thanks i'm sure she appreciates that
852625674426863619 2017-04-13 20:52:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts all riiiiiight i stand corrected
852625381341507586 2017-04-13 20:51:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen yeah, i'm just glad she's all right. i'll definitely have to go visit her soon
852625145378344960 2017-04-13 20:50:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts i guess it could but you don't hear about people getting slashed in the face on the subway in midtown or lower manhattan very often
852624775092600834 2017-04-13 20:49:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts what scares me is that this happened at my subway station...
852623737493094401 2017-04-13 20:45:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts yeah me too
852621573131563013 2017-04-13 20:36:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith I know I'm worried about her; I will have to go out to her place and visit her soon
852620929435873283 2017-04-13 20:34:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> My old editor from Brownstoner was slashed in the face on the A train at my local subway stop yesterdayhttp://nypost.com/2017/04/13/real-estate-blog-editor-slashed-in-face-feared-she-would-bleed-to-death/
852620440140996608 2017-04-13 20:32:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism read the story and look at the plans on file with DOB
852619906260627456 2017-04-13 20:30:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i think there is something to that. not many decently sized, residentially zoned sites left in the Hasidic part of the hood
852619532954988545 2017-04-13 20:28:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism idk the developer just claimed he was able to bid it up bc he got lots of competition for the site
852619132717682688 2017-04-13 20:26:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism
852619076753076226 2017-04-13 20:26:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Development site in Hasidic Bed-Stuy sells for $12M/$314 per buildable square foot, apparently kinda $$ for the hoodhttps://commercialobserver.com/2017/04/bed-stuy-development-site-slated-to-become-hotel-and-synagogue-fetches-12m/

852365168046690304 2017-04-12 03:37:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy both
852364648385060864 2017-04-12 03:35:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy many of them are not publicly posted on the paper's websites/you have to do some digging to figure out who they are
852357633482817536 2017-04-12 03:07:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'd be interested in this, as a piece of media reporting, if someone surveyed the composition of editorial boards of all the major papers

852351071511076866 2017-04-12 02:41:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> Plenty of women and POCs on their contributing writers list so clearly they have no problem hitting those people up for specific topics
852349132090077184 2017-04-12 02:34:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katiebrenzel @MosesNYC @_willparker_ i guess you can only say "tax break" so many times
852348889885757440 2017-04-12 02:33:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> I have this radical idea that they could expand the scope of their hiring beyond current newspaper op-ed writers, who are largely white men
852346562340696065 2017-04-12 02:23:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Maybe not another white man? Just a thoughthttps://twitter.com/mckaycoppins/status/852322995897085955

852242038640791553 2017-04-12 19:28:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas the times just did a feature on manhattanville and only touched very briefly on the controversial parts https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi378OV05_TAhXjrlQKHZR7DyIQFggaMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F03%2F22%2Fnyregion%2Fnyc-cornell-columbia-nyu-campuses.html&usg=AFQjCNFrM8QQqWVd8oyuO33B78s8rGKNuQ&sig2=1Yf-PcEOMPD0wPc17TFvkQ&bvm=bv.152180690,d.eWE
852240985455243264 2017-04-12 19:24:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas also the eminent domain was really just one piece of that long, controversial planning process for the manhattanville campus
852240010518691840 2017-04-12 19:20:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i talk about that
852239448184160260 2017-04-12 19:18:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you remember what the corner of 125th and Broadway used to look like, what Columbia has built here is incredible

851855928618098688 2017-04-11 17:54:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @taylorjwofford A public meeting in Park Slope last year was the first time i've heard people hiss at a developer
851855624233156610 2017-04-11 17:53:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @taylorjwofford It's true, the angry white people of Park Slope are very effectively organized

851850584655355911 2017-04-11 17:33:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @MarketUrbanism i've done that transfer too and unless something crazy's going on with the bus  i think it's always faster than doing subways into manhattan

851212534023692288 2017-04-09 23:17:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad the city goes where it either owns land or can afford to lease space and the upper east side has neither of those qualities
851211868060487681 2017-04-09 23:14:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad I don't care about the media narrative; I'm talking about the policy implications
851211077274800129 2017-04-09 23:11:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad It's not complex when one neighborhood has 15 shelters and the other has zero. Fewer shelters in white hoods means more in hoods of color
851208500323680257 2017-04-09 23:01:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad that's too bad but maspeth was not treated any differently by the city than anywhere else. only difference is the city caved in that case
851207212412391424 2017-04-09 22:56:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad also the opposition to maspeth shelters did involve racist sentiment while the opposition to them here does not

847968425913839616 2017-03-31 00:26:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @errollouis This was not meant as an inherent negative but as a prediction. The city should build jails where it feels they are necessary
847967992260460544 2017-03-31 00:24:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @errollouis Sure, but there are folks living near all those courthouses who will raise hell! And so will their elected representatives
847964362253979648 2017-03-31 00:10:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> We also have the shuttered Spofford juvie detention center in the S Bronx, which is finally about to be redeveloped into affordable housing
847964028748124160 2017-03-31 00:09:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> reminds me @AnnaESanders any movement on that jail property or is it still stuck in limbo?
847963727181881344 2017-03-31 00:08:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne Considering that most of the people in Rikers are awaiting trial, parole violators, etc
847963409698172928 2017-03-31 00:06:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne I think changing sentencing and bail rules should definitely be part of the equation. We can hope!
847962728329355264 2017-03-31 00:04:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn Ah! Makes sense
847962657684672514 2017-03-31 00:03:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> Worth noting that the city has an existing, shuttered jail on SI. They rent it for film shoots. Maybe renovate into a better jail?
847961575160000512 2017-03-31 23:59:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> Closing Rikers is an excellent goal but the political backlash of building more jails will be immense
847961192773668864 2017-03-31 23:57:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @errollouis @RosaGoldensohn @TweetBenMax It would depend heavily on where you're building, whether city has to xfer ownership, existing zoning/land use rules
847960829102366720 2017-03-31 23:56:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @errollouis @RosaGoldensohn @TweetBenMax Or it might not be full ULURP but there will be some form of public review involving CPC and community boards I'd expect

847264493130227712 2017-03-29 01:49:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism this is just based on transfer tax?
847263373578297346 2017-03-29 01:45:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism oh he's owned it for a long time then
847262071003545600 2017-03-29 01:39:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism I guess it's possible the seller who gave it up for 7.2 didn't know what it was worth or really wanted to get rid of it
847261750789496835 2017-03-29 01:38:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism you're referring to the first sale or the second?

847253528472985600 2017-03-29 01:05:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller ha! Not huge but decent sized. One Whitehall
847253349120344066 2017-03-29 01:05:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> $43 million versus $7.2 million... I think the first sale was far undermarket
847253047751221253 2017-03-29 01:04:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> Today I wrote about a development site in North Williamsburg where the seller made 6 times what he paid 9 months agohttps://commercialobserver.com/2017/03/cw-realty-management-nabs-williamsburg-development-site-for-43m/

847154233564708864 2017-03-29 18:31:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i thought they called it The Hole
847140649438793728 2017-03-29 17:37:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy yes $500/sf is according to New York Building Congress
847126512369373184 2017-03-29 16:41:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism does this sound crazy? it includes acquisition/demolition/hard and soft construction costs/marketing afterwards
847126249780789248 2017-03-29 16:40:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> I actually tried to ask them for comps on how much it costs to construct an average office building in Manhattan but they didn't have them
847125759735025664 2017-03-29 16:38:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> While I was reporting this, REBNY told me it would cost $2.1 BILLION to develop an office building on Park Avenuehttps://commercialobserver.com/2017/03/after-five-years-midtown-east-rezoning-inches-toward-the-finish-line/

846074441788461061 2017-03-26 19:00:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @alon_levy pretty sure i just kept them :)
846074274137980928 2017-03-26 19:00:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @alon_levy also recommended: Ocean at the End of the Lane, and Good Omens, which is hilarious

846073798818455553 2017-03-26 18:58:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @alon_levy if you have nerd friends who like comics, get someone to lend you the first couple issues of Sandman. truly a classic

846049627883364352 2017-03-26 17:22:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik so it's abandoned because the city doesn't know who owns it (but probably the city owns it and doesn't realize)

845778999443886086 2017-03-25 23:26:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jg_bollard since that perpetuates a negative and ultimately very narrow narrative constructed by mainstream news outlets

845778177024806912 2017-03-25 23:23:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jg_bollard it's also just weird to compare crown heights, a residential neighborhood in BK, to a post-industrial CT city
845776368701001728 2017-03-25 23:16:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jg_bollard by white/high education are you talking about gentrifiers or lubavitchers?
845772257368649728 2017-03-25 22:59:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jg_bollard i don't doubt that about yale but that seems pretty simplistic for crown heights

844007980483928064 2017-03-20 02:09:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ but is the actual email subject line "hello :)" because that's weird as hell
844006675594035209 2017-03-20 02:04:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you're flacking for a well known city organization, maybe don't put emoticons in your email subject lines
844005892731355136 2017-03-20 02:01:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thetomzone they wanted to keep Barron in school here so that's what they're doing
844005721662545921 2017-03-20 02:00:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thetomzone I mean sidelined but right now it's kind of her choice?
844005347639672833 2017-03-20 01:58:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald @jangelooff was this the one about the sad transfer at 14th street?
843995335248744448 2017-03-20 01:19:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca I doubt that's true! I think it has more to do with inertia than the cost but Im sure upfront cost plays a role
843994795357978624 2017-03-20 01:16:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca but IMO if Philly can do it on buses/trains/trolleys NYC certainly can
843994678177411072 2017-03-20 01:16:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca yeah I'm sure that's part of it. I think a lot of it is just taking the time/spending the $$ to install on all kinds of transit
843993402580652034 2017-03-20 01:11:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca but I do wonder how the card-driven payment system will affect poorest folks who are still cash-reliant
843993073705279488 2017-03-20 01:10:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca so I guess they were just like fuck it let's go from tokens to contactless payment
843992935221919744 2017-03-20 01:09:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca I mean I think in Philly it was just out of hand since they were using a fare payment system that's been around since 19th c
843986453478760448 2017-03-20 00:43:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome however I do wonder what it means for the cash-reliant poor...
843985581231259650 2017-03-20 00:40:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome in NYC we're probably 3-5 years out from any kind of new fare payment system. Meanwhile Philly went from tokens to this!
843985216515596288 2017-03-20 00:38:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> I admit it, the SEPTA key card is great now that it's rolled out in most places
843984100126003200 2017-03-20 00:34:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome honestly I tried to avoid buying the card but they don't really give you a choice
843983909759213568 2017-03-20 00:33:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome but now that it's rolled out it works perfectly! Tho I did have someone on the bus half an hr ago ask me where I bought the card
843979354656968705 2017-03-20 00:15:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome I know
843978983616270338 2017-03-20 00:14:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome a lot of it is quite new but they are implementing it now. A lot of the stations you can't even buy the tokens now
843978373798002689 2017-03-20 00:11:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome it's been rolled out everywhere I've gone
843975546920931328 2017-03-20 00:00:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy a lot of stations you can't even buy the tokens
843975390951628800 2017-03-20 23:59:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy they do but now they kinda force you to buy the SEPTA key card in a lot of places and it's pretty good!
843973854037004289 2017-03-20 23:53:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> How does Philly suddenly have better fare payment technology than NYC?

843304569346162688 2017-03-18 03:34:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> Interesting to consider unions as both positive organizing forces and corruptible and potentially racist political entities...
843300593615671300 2017-03-18 03:18:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes we've talked about most of these stories - I've heard from other folks about the Chicago unions too

843195370293354496 2017-03-18 20:20:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder I did this earlier today! Also I am just now realizing I had to ask the guy at the subway window for a xfer to the bus?
843194431373283329 2017-03-18 20:16:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder I wonder if I could just throw a nickel in there? would they even notice? Should I get one of the new swipe card things?
843192928549986305 2017-03-18 20:10:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> SEPTA tokens are oddly quaint and I wonder how this transit system makes any money

842468119440441350 2017-03-16 20:10:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik neither the abatement (421-a) nor the zoning are particularly unusual. it was just a weird phrase from WSJ
842467484309553152 2017-03-16 20:07:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik i'm not sure what you're talking about

842407489329065988 2017-03-16 16:09:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> There's also the more obvious question of why you would leak the details of your very expensive deal to Bloomberg (and the NYT?)

842061182206914566 2017-03-15 17:13:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> As it faces $80 million in budget cuts, NYCHA moves forward with its NextGen affordable development programhttp://www.yimbynews.com/2017/03/nycha-plans-south-bronx-senior-housing-at-mill-brook-houses-in-mott-haven.html
842058402478071808 2017-03-15 17:02:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple the DOB BIS has gotten better actually! so has ACRIS. they've gone from being borderline unusable to buggy like 30% of the time
842057832954511360 2017-03-15 17:00:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple also remember when you could only load ACRIS docs if you were using firefox and the stars aligned correctly? ridiculous
842057382150713350 2017-03-15 16:58:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple that i believe. telecom stuff is very regulated
842056268126793729 2017-03-15 16:53:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> The real kicker is that you can't FOIL rent stabilization info as a journalist. Only tenants, owners, or prospective buyers can request it
842055755645784064 2017-03-15 16:51:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple can you?? i'm not sure if that's always the case. maybe i've never looked that closely at the middle pages for an RS building
842055308541337600 2017-03-15 16:50:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple if it were in ACRIS, it would be a lot easier...
842053780313128960 2017-03-15 16:44:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn or they're not really answering the questions when they are hard
842053563316604931 2017-03-15 16:43:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i'm not sure what you mean. RS data isn't really in ACRIS. it might be listed way deep in a mortgage or something?
842052845792833537 2017-03-15 16:40:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple yeah exactly. from that perspective, i think it's a matter of organization more than anything else
842052510084923392 2017-03-15 16:38:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple like if you could FOIL rent-stabilized leases...
842052406364012545 2017-03-15 16:38:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rolandlisf yes they say that often
842052003954077699 2017-03-15 16:36:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple but they could certainly get their act together and release general info on RS units w/o saying who lives in them
842051876061339649 2017-03-15 16:36:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i think the idea is that they don't want to furnish records that will violate privacy of regular citizens
842051530853351425 2017-03-15 16:35:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i think as a prospective buyer, you can request. i don't think that courtesy extends to prospective renters
842050846116438016 2017-03-15 16:32:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i even tried calling DHCR and harassing them. they were like you can't get this info as a reporter, only as a tenant or landlord
842050576846323712 2017-03-15 16:31:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i believe rent-regulation info cannot be FOILed, which is pretty incredible
842050148494630912 2017-03-15 16:29:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple yes, i think they got it from FOILing the public advocate's office. they also don't even know whether the bldgs are stabilized!
842049450747035648 2017-03-15 16:26:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> Rosenthal seemed to think HPD kept copies of all rent-regulated leases, which I think is only true if a building is in one of their programs
842048512003059712 2017-03-15 16:23:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> But the current system - in which only tenants can find out whether their own unit is rent-regulated - largely benefits landlords
842048375528779777 2017-03-15 16:22:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> As to why the state can't or won't release data on rent-regulated apartments in NYC, your guess is as good as mine
842048218405998593 2017-03-15 16:21:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> Rosenthal asks HPD to give data on rent-regulated leases. Torres Springer says they'll give what info they have, but the state has that data

842045070509522944 2017-03-15 16:09:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> HPD doesn't provide Section 8 vouchers to public, unlike NYCHA. Only to buildings participating in certain programs http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/section-8/applicants-eligibility.page

842041746305519616 2017-03-15 15:56:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> I wonder how many people are on HPD's Section 8 voucher waiting list. NYCHA has 150,000 families waiting for Section 8 vouchers
842041326803795969 2017-03-15 15:54:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> I don't think HPD makes it easy to build below-market homes (particularly outside of mixed-income projects), but I'd love to hear otherwise
842040375606947842 2017-03-15 15:50:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> While these programs were essentially brought back from the dead under de Blasio, it's not clear to me developers are using them
842040194543017984 2017-03-15 15:50:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> I've heard for a long time that it's difficult to secure financing and make it feasible to build affordable homes/condos in NYC
842039402159312896 2017-03-15 15:46:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn HPD effectively abandoned affordable home building programs under Bloomberg. devs are just starting to take advantage again

842035798644002820 2017-03-15 15:32:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly what's funny is i wrote about this guy in 2015... he is far from the only SI prop owner with mob connections http://www.yimbynews.com/2015/12/new-office-development-comes-to-staten-island-permits-filed-for-21-sylvation-terrace-rosebank.html

842033070232489984 2017-03-15 15:21:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn i don't think they've changed. but they've had more time to build under the low-income program, ELLA
842031509108334592 2017-03-15 15:15:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> He filed plans for an office development back in 2015 and I discovered his amazing back story/arrest/etc http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/12/new-office-development-comes-to-staten-island-permits-filed-for-21-sylvation-terrace-rosebank.html

841401603324297218 2017-03-13 21:32:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> And as @MaraGay noted, with a projected $6 billion budget cut for HUD, NYCHA could in fact lose up to $150 millionhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-aid-reduced-for-new-york-city-housing-authority-1488844639
841400645697601537 2017-03-13 21:28:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> She also mentioned that there are 250,000 people on NYCHA's waiting list for apartments. 150,000 on the Section 8 voucher waiting list.
841400112186290177 2017-03-13 21:26:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> During the hearing, Shola Olatoye said Ben Carson hasn't responded to invitations to come tour NYC's public housing
841399272461520896 2017-03-13 21:23:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> Spent my afternoon at a Council hearing on NYCHA budget cuts. We stand to lose at least $81 million, much of which comes from Section 8 cuts
841395702441902080 2017-03-13 21:09:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 lol of course he puts them on his fb page first

841368726763106305 2017-03-13 19:21:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bruteforceblog or do you get to build less affordable housing if you're willing to do more public improvements or something?
841368168123768833 2017-03-13 19:19:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bruteforceblog the requirement seems low. how do they determine the %age of affordable housing required in a new building?
841367030511075328 2017-03-13 19:15:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @heidigroover you have mandatory affordable housing policies in seattle too? is it required with a rezoning or just required in general?
841351575138381827 2017-03-13 18:13:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> NYCHA says decrease in the value of the LIHTC will create funding gaps for construction of 100% affordable housing
841349630549979136 2017-03-13 18:05:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @stateofthecity NYCHA is rather complex!
841346506166796289 2017-03-13 17:53:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you ever want to feel really out of your depth, sit in on a city budget hearing

840709891325083648 2017-03-11 23:43:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito you mean the relatives stay on as tenants in the apartment with new owner?
840709659761733632 2017-03-11 23:42:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito the lede is about a woman who sells her one-bedroom to her neighbor but stays on as a tenant and pays below-market rent

840634121596608513 2017-03-11 18:42:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion she mentions GDS! And St Albans, Sidwell. I went to Flint Hill, out near Vienna
840633422016045057 2017-03-11 18:40:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion also tysons was inexplicably the only decent mall in the burbs & people would brave all kinds of horrible traffic to get there..
840633199403384832 2017-03-11 18:39:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion i knew plenty of people like her though, which is probably why it's funny to me.
840632866245623811 2017-03-11 18:37:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion i'm from northern VA and i went to a private school (but wasn't wealthy like she was). in many ways it still rings true, lol

840437137774391296 2017-03-10 05:40:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne they never explicitly say where they are, though i don't doubt that's where it was shot
840436891090587648 2017-03-10 05:39:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne is it?? but everything is kind of southern-inflected, except for references to "the city" and people being from brooklyn

840276833719504897 2017-03-10 19:03:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty i hope there is a way to establish a happy medium, since i think it's a problem here that many landlords are too choosy
840276472883478528 2017-03-10 19:01:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty it's also a big problem if you want to secure affordable housing and go through a lottery here managed by HPD
840276339341066242 2017-03-10 19:01:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty since i know a lot of people who are freelance writers or artists & their lack of W2s is a big red flag to a lot of landlords
840276105575727104 2017-03-10 19:00:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty but the part about not allowing discrimination against alternative sources of income is important and IMO we need that here
840275841179369472 2017-03-10 18:59:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty i'm not sure about insider friendly, but i think there are a lot of crazy/irresponsible tenants who seem fine on paper
840275231856029696 2017-03-10 18:56:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty i get the aim - to prevent discrimination - but it seems like the laws already in place would do that if properly enforced
840274762345660416 2017-03-10 18:54:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> This Seattle first-come, first-served renter law is fascinating but I can see how it would be very problematichttp://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-landlords-sue-challenge-citys-first-come-first-served-rental-law/

840261960776200193 2017-03-10 18:03:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Since Meatpacking is the place where the luxury brands do/sell silly things that cost more money than I make in a year so...
840261554734059522 2017-03-10 18:02:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's weird (or appropriate??) that Restoration Hardware is opening a hotel in Meatpacking.

840250922584403968 2017-03-10 17:20:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> So not only did rents increase 15% in Mott Haven last year, but they decreased at least 10% in UES/UWS/Gramercy/Sohohttp://www.welcome2thebronx.com/wordpress/2017/03/07/south-bronx-sees-biggest-increase-in-1-bedroom-rents-as-overall-nyc-rents-drop-9-1/
840249492972675073 2017-03-10 17:14:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yeah i agree with you on the top of the building... they could throw some detailing/cornice up there to help match it
840248808650989568 2017-03-10 17:11:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism why
840248659275059200 2017-03-10 17:11:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nwmalinowski you're referring to the one in Mott Haven? https://www1.nyc.gov/site/acs/justice/secure-detention.page

840247140316262409 2017-03-10 17:05:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nwmalinowski the ACS secure facility is on rikers or its in Hunts Point? sorry for my ignorance
840246384636940288 2017-03-10 17:02:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> I really like the murals in the lobbyhttps://twitter.com/CurbedNY/status/840245894490517508
840245277936275456 2017-03-10 16:57:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nwmalinowski is the issue relocating the inmates or just the fact that building jails is hard and expensive? or both?
840245157580689409 2017-03-10 16:57:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn looks like an office space for the factory
840243908126879745 2017-03-10 16:52:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn it looks more like a weird jerry-rigged construction than a former house but maybe you saw something i can't in this pic
840243772504039424 2017-03-10 16:51:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn i wonder if the windows were built just to make it legal in some way? since the entire rear wall is window-less
840235401910599680 2017-03-10 16:18:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen valid
840235359757819904 2017-03-10 16:18:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen this makes me feel better! I've eaten at a lot of these places and IMO barboncino does have v good pizza. but i'm biased!
840235072359940097 2017-03-10 16:17:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @westsiderag yes i agree but it's not clear to me what the state is actually doing or how it's counting those units
840234676845436929 2017-03-10 16:15:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon i guess it's been true for the last year and a half so at this point basically yes!
840234410968535041 2017-03-10 16:14:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen **should be
840234263631024129 2017-03-10 16:13:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen i feel barboncino should have be on here
840233976501526528 2017-03-10 16:12:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> So clearly everything is going great with our state legislature!!
840233309489770496 2017-03-10 16:10:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Yesterday I called HPD & asked what was happening w/ 421-a. The friendly female press officer basically said "Lol you know as much as we do"
840230985706942465 2017-03-10 16:00:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @JacobGarchik rachel, did you try the turmeric custard?
840229255653003265 2017-03-10 15:53:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @JacobGarchik i might be willing to trek there in the snow today
840224757534642176 2017-03-10 15:36:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> BdB: I love [Cuomo's plan] if it's real... I need a timeline and I need to see real dollars moving
840224478428856320 2017-03-10 15:35:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @2AvSagas @JacobGarchik all the fritted glass details are hilarious
840223282251067395 2017-03-10 15:30:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat yeah idk man
840223182435024898 2017-03-10 15:29:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> Brian: you might have to go back in the middle of a budget yr and change? BdB: it would be "insane" to start declaring dollar signs for cuts
840222895762743296 2017-03-10 15:28:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> "I'm not going to enable these cuts" by making the budget reflective of them, the mayor says on Brian Lehrer
840222153182203905 2017-03-10 15:25:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism your dream home http://ny.curbed.com/2017/3/9/14869352/brooklyn-contemporary-mansion-for-sale
840215714971680768 2017-03-10 15:00:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn where is this
840073017292079105 2017-03-09 05:33:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn also this is wrong and extremely easy to fact check. frustratingpic.twitter.com/2bkq2mUNX3
840069923867049985 2017-03-09 05:20:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn great coverage of homelessness stuff. for them to cover a neighborhood-specific thing like this is kinda unusual these days
840065636185210882 2017-03-09 05:03:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn i didn't even realize the Times had covered this. nice to see them taking an interest
840033488782934016 2017-03-09 02:56:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NickAddamo I'll be sure to ask next time I go.
840032973567213568 2017-03-09 02:54:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NickAddamo however! the underground river is cool. So is the lil skate park with the graffiti. Maybe other things I don't know about, idk
840032668767125504 2017-03-09 02:52:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NickAddamo also not a ton of retail, retail that's there closes early, and even the resi parts of Hartford just feel depressed
840031722490195968 2017-03-09 02:49:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NickAddamo Hartford is kinda bleak
840031335158751232 2017-03-09 02:47:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rickbruner @nahmias what did he say? Did he mention the stats about how many homeless come from CD8?
840030423052877824 2017-03-09 02:43:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AnnaESanders I'm surprised they haven't found a property on the north shore
840027945049686016 2017-03-09 02:34:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade it's like those photos of Charlotte Street in the 70s, but Indiana
840027434166734853 2017-03-09 02:32:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JCColtin what else did he say about "the youth"
839996049561391108 2017-03-09 00:27:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CityAndStateNY @NYCMayor @JCColtin the fact that i can't really tell if you're joking is slightly depressing

839960263788994561 2017-03-09 22:05:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @myhairisblue what are you wearing here? concealer, blush, foundation? maybe something on your lips?
839935210699513856 2017-03-09 20:25:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also architecture, housing policy, transportation, construction, infrastructure, all kinds of of NYC minutiae. You get a lot of freedom!

839908359306362880 2017-03-09 18:38:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @JacobGarchik also i would bet money that he's including CAMBA gardens in that unit total
839903649488912384 2017-03-09 18:20:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @JacobGarchik read the NYT story, they mention specific neighborhoods
839902939191836672 2017-03-09 18:17:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday do you think this has anything to do with the armory? i think it is, um, not coincidental
839902647276699648 2017-03-09 18:16:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> Jared and Ivanka once again embarrassed by real estate reporting bc their landlord controls a huge mining empire https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivanka-trumps-landlord-is-a-chilean-billionaire-suing-the-u-s-government-1489000307pic.twitter.com/Q6bySb3ur4

839883813865979904 2017-03-09 17:01:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin @MarketUrbanism for $2500 you can get a private roof deck! lol http://streeteasy.com/building/135-alexander-avenue-bronx/4c
839882783182974978 2017-03-09 16:57:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin @MarketUrbanism they typically point to comps in the neighborhood, like this http://streeteasy.com/building/135-alexander-avenue-bronx/2c or clocktower bldg
839882513036238849 2017-03-09 16:56:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin no. since developer doesn't know whether they'll get 421-a or what market will be like in 2020, they can't really talk about it
839881168455626753 2017-03-09 16:50:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @devin_mb what's also cool here is now you can walk to randall's island
839880086916583426 2017-03-09 16:46:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism all told it's like 1300 units and like 600 spots?
839878631442653184 2017-03-09 16:40:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon oh my god dave
839878483211878400 2017-03-09 16:40:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes
839877840518676481 2017-03-09 16:37:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes, as it stands currently
839877737363947520 2017-03-09 16:37:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter also thanks amy :)
839877695878090753 2017-03-09 16:37:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter i know, idk what's going on with the bridge in the rendering but i kinda like it? it's certainly not attractive today
839877471768051712 2017-03-09 16:36:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes, accurate
839877173766995969 2017-03-09 16:34:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also this will be the largest market-rate project to be built in the South Bronx in probably the last 30 years
839876494268694529 2017-03-09 16:32:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism not for parking, possibly for other things like waterfront use
839876356313866246 2017-03-09 16:31:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Urbablurb that would be great! but i don't get that gist from the admittedly vague NYT piece
839875983306076160 2017-03-09 16:30:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism offering plans do get rejected but i think that's mainly if you are up to something shady
839875707199188992 2017-03-09 16:29:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism given the current market in the neighborhood, it's unlikely they would condo it in the near future
839875463585677314 2017-03-09 16:28:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes, only if converted to condo, which requires state approval
839874907999698946 2017-03-09 16:25:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday thank you rachel
839874799946067969 2017-03-09 16:25:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism units can't be individually bought & sold. the only entity that can sell them is the developer/current bldg owner
839873966789517313 2017-03-09 16:22:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism they are eligible but the tax break they would receive is lapsed at the moment
839873855162286081 2017-03-09 16:21:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism totally different! nothing like condos.
839873384032911364 2017-03-09 16:19:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i have no idea what you're asking here
839872851582795776 2017-03-09 16:17:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> First building is financed, second one is not. Both are eligible for 421-a but developer wouldn't comment on the tax abatement issue
839872527820283908 2017-03-09 16:16:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple ohh yeah i guess it does look very slope-y
839872433855287307 2017-03-09 16:16:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @JacobGarchik he is literally making this up
839871904064356352 2017-03-09 16:14:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple this is not about park slope
839871796681797632 2017-03-09 16:13:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> The developers, Chetrit Group and Somerset Partners, plan to break ground on the first phase of construction next week
839871588564668418 2017-03-09 16:12:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i think the idea is to fix up existing parks and rec facilities
839871457886863360 2017-03-09 16:12:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> I have new renderings, details on the 1,300-unit, 25-story market rate rental project on the South Bronx waterfront http://www.yimbynews.com/2017/03/revealed-2401-third-avenue-and-101-lincoln-avenue-massive-south-bronx-residential-project.htmlpic.twitter.com/8LtcuTFLTJ

839653464770809856 2017-03-08 01:46:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mccanner do some startups not give health insurance?
839652934149353472 2017-03-08 01:43:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mccanner what freelance writers do you know who are making $75K a year??

839651712831012864 2017-03-08 01:39:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull @jessicaplautz i hope it's not me! also i saw you in bagel pub today amanda
839647544464539649 2017-03-08 01:22:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dahvnyc @BrooklynSpoke they should ask for lighting on Empire
839644291056164865 2017-03-08 01:09:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dahvnyc oh no which one? or is this the full board
839643736434933760 2017-03-08 01:07:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @KELLYWEILL stephen is responsible for actually-ing all real estate related content
839641714159718402 2017-03-08 00:59:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> Activists and neighbors want to kill the controversial plan to redevelop the Bedford Union Armory in Crown Heights http://www.yimbynews.com/2017/03/fight-to-redevelop-the-bedford-union-armory-in-crown-heights-heats-up.htmlpic.twitter.com/2QcBbv1ZAO
839638993780232192 2017-03-08 00:48:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen jill! congrats
839638369445556227 2017-03-08 00:46:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin so i told my landlord he needed to give me an RS lease and couldn't raise my rent and he needs to start following the law
839638208812036097 2017-03-08 00:45:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin ... so i looked it up and my building (which is 90 years old and 8 units) of course gets the fucking tax abatement!
839637762341015553 2017-03-08 00:43:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin a while back i was reading the propublica piece about how lots of LLs got J-51 abatements and didn't give stabilized leases...
839629029728714753 2017-03-08 00:08:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin this was true for me too except it was tax abatements and rent stabilization! lol my landlord is such a scumbag
839614919888732160 2017-03-08 23:12:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @heidigroover we need this emoji but i don't know what it would actually look like
839614855971749888 2017-03-08 23:12:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @heidigroover omg getting mansplained in the comments (or on twitter) emoji!!!!
839613105177001984 2017-03-08 23:05:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alanalevinson @mekosoff thank you for this alana
839575284449947648 2017-03-08 20:35:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito if deleting some 5-yr-old posts is the worst thing that comes out of this, let all of us (and the respective staffs) be so lucky
839574143150456832 2017-03-08 20:30:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito i think it's a problem if they change their coverage to reflect his political views, which i don't expect will happen
839573456396161024 2017-03-08 20:28:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito oh come on
839568222395502599 2017-03-08 20:07:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad if he did, he would have made DNA into the New York Post or something
839568088060276736 2017-03-08 20:06:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad i don't think he cares enough to use his $$ to change local news coverage. he's not rupert murdoch
839557794693058563 2017-03-08 19:25:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad and i don't think Rickett's ownership of DNA had any influence over DNA's coverage either
839557614723870720 2017-03-08 19:25:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad they have good editors and reporters and i don't think deleting old posts really says anything super controversial
839551310370336768 2017-03-08 19:00:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Guys I'm really sad that WaPo killed the Peep diorama contesthttps://twitter.com/GenePark/status/839227555865640961
839547505486462976 2017-03-08 18:44:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday free press is free press
839542390235009024 2017-03-08 18:24:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Russ_Steinberg i only know because their LI fans mob atlantic ave subway/LIRR station all the time and they wear a lot of orange/blue
839541843461357576 2017-03-08 18:22:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Russ_Steinberg i feel like it's always the islanders
839532468118175745 2017-03-08 17:45:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petenychange @ceaweaver @MosesNYC i think both of those are at issue here, at least for DSA (and potentially NYCC too?)
839528138631757825 2017-03-08 17:28:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nycDSA @nealmeyer @ceaweaver yes, we need to overhaul a punitive property tax system that punishes renters rather than creating stopgaps
839527152030793728 2017-03-08 17:24:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nealmeyer sure, but i was asking about here in NYC specifically, how we would go about doing that considering we have to deal with state
839526706394382344 2017-03-08 17:22:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petenychange @ceaweaver @nealmeyer and what if that takes years? what happens to our armory in the meantime? it continues to sit vacant?
839526454845128704 2017-03-08 17:21:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petenychange @ceaweaver @nealmeyer all right, taxes. how do you make sure the state leg passes the taxes you want to build hsg we need?
839525617318170624 2017-03-08 17:17:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nealmeyer tell me more about taxing the rich
839523010352668672 2017-03-08 17:07:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petenychange @ceaweaver i'm not saying that we need to start from that premise, but i'm asking what is  alternative if city can't or won't
839522544961130499 2017-03-08 17:05:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petenychange @ceaweaver should the options be 100% low income housing or nothing at all? how does the latter benefit the hood?
839522259098284032 2017-03-08 17:04:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petenychange @ceaweaver sure but if the city won't pay for that to happen?
839522120531079168 2017-03-08 17:04:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petenychange @ceaweaver i guess, but if gov't can't/won't provide housing needed, doesn't that clash w/ idea of ensuring everyone has it?
839521426235359235 2017-03-08 17:01:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petenychange that's not what i'm saying
839501599668060160 2017-03-08 15:42:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca yeah i mean we had these issues even before young white guys from the DSA got involved
839500989052891138 2017-03-08 15:40:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @steadyblogging oh rachel's story is uphttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170308/crown-heights/bedford-union-armory-scoping-hearing-deal-public-comments
839500803211735040 2017-03-08 15:39:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @steadyblogging probably not yet but all the usual suspects were there
839499422727876610 2017-03-08 15:33:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @steadyblogging yes it was last night, no i didn't really tweet about it
839495122987413504 2017-03-08 15:16:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca really? have you been following?
839491920619573253 2017-03-08 15:04:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jeremymbarr is that a sentence or
839491608320045057 2017-03-08 15:02:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL idk it's kinda like mom and dad divorced but now they have to negotiate awkward shared custody
839491079170850816 2017-03-08 15:00:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> I have great respect for both pubs but one has opinion and a clear tone and the other prides itself on remaining neutral...
839490468887080961 2017-03-08 14:58:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon congrats!!!
839489760272007168 2017-03-08 14:55:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> In case you were asleep, I was Mad Online last night about our local DSA chapter and housinghttps://twitter.com/thecitywanderer/status/839351957546496000
839487758490021888 2017-03-08 14:47:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> DNAinfo owner Joe Ricketts has acquired Gothamist & promised it will become the "official blog" of DNAinfo New Yorkhttp://www.politico.com/media/story/2017/03/trump-donor-local-news-publisher-joe-ricketts-acquires-gothamist-websites-004939
839484846376382466 2017-03-08 14:35:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj I don't think so
839361570207596544 2017-03-07 06:26:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ well there is this but it doesn't really help ushttp://www.dsausa.org/a_social_and_economic_bill_of_rights
839359092531609602 2017-03-07 06:16:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ i don't know! Does the DSA have a fleshed out position on these topics?
839358501499568128 2017-03-07 06:13:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ sure. but i guess i feel like in this case those probably don't square with the reality we're grappling with right now?
839357627964526592 2017-03-07 06:10:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> and pay for maintenance, & taxes if tax abatements or agreements w/ the city expire. Also need mechanisms to ensure long-term affordability
839356358457712640 2017-03-07 06:05:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you wanna talk about community land trusts & non-profit development corps, great. But we still need to find a way to pay for construction
839355189043822592 2017-03-07 06:00:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @eean @tdfischer_ @LFreshwater oh i didn't go! the bronx activists are tough though. how was it?
839355054100459520 2017-03-07 06:00:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Unfortunately we are living in an era where hsg subsidies won't be what they were even under Obama. How do you subsidize lower income hsg?
839354608208203776 2017-03-07 05:58:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> Have it our way or nothing at all is not going to bring affordable housing, parks, or rec centers to your neighborhood
839354445624459264 2017-03-07 05:57:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @eean @tdfischer_ yeah the problem is that being pro-development is seen as being fundamentally corporate
839354098944180224 2017-03-07 05:56:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @eean yeah i saw that! good to hear
839353948809138178 2017-03-07 05:55:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder honestly i dont think that really has much to do with it since this rhetoric hasn't changed in years
839353687642353664 2017-03-07 05:54:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> And if the site is a difficult one to develop, the mostly likely outcome is that it will remain vacant for the foreseeable future
839353431622053888 2017-03-07 05:53:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> The idea that a project should be killed bc it's not 100% affordable and won't remain publicly/co-operatively owned is unproductive at best
839352774856957952 2017-03-07 05:51:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@alexbaca recently had a very good thread about this. thought of it during the Bedford Union Armory meetinghttps://twitter.com/alexbaca/status/835649637428178948
839351957546496000 2017-03-07 05:47:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's cool that DSA is taking an interest in NYC land use issues, but it would be even better if they advocated for effective housing policy
839348640133050371 2017-03-07 05:34:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KaylaEpstein well at least measure S isn't winning
839333325181431808 2017-03-07 04:33:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj being allegedly woke is a basic part of airbnb's shtick. their emails asking for you to sign their petitions are hilarious too
839321015654170624 2017-03-07 03:44:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @marctorrence welcome! Crown Heights is great and ~gentrification~ has made everyone crazy
839320225539579904 2017-03-07 03:41:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @marctorrence were you at the one in feb that cumbo hosted at medgar Evers? That was a fun one
839318047773102080 2017-03-07 03:33:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @marctorrence yeah! Talking to Sam

839216169093591042 2017-03-07 20:48:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC link?
839194433094619140 2017-03-07 19:21:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @whstancil no doubt, but i think the averaging would be most effective in $$ markets like NYC/SF where market rates are high
839192831503839233 2017-03-07 19:15:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whstancil @DanielKayHertz this onehttps://twitter.com/whstancil/status/839174873092083712
839192291919134720 2017-03-07 19:13:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whstancil @DanielKayHertz honestly i've seen LIHTCs used in very strong markets in NYC so i wouldn't make that assumption...
839174707165417472 2017-03-07 18:03:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whstancil @DanielKayHertz and i think we need to find ways to grapple with the financial reality of reduced HUD budget under Trump
839174335604621313 2017-03-07 18:02:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @whstancil but i wouldn't call it larger subsidies for VLI since that implies gov't is kicking in more $$ (they won't)
839173683470090242 2017-03-07 17:59:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @whstancil yes but the end game is to produce more low income hsg in a climate where feds will slash subsidy dramatically
839171532819677186 2017-03-07 17:50:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj hm yes there are a lot of substances here
839170578158338048 2017-03-07 17:47:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj oh lol its a boring one
839170400592474112 2017-03-07 17:46:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj omg i love ny mag sex diaries, they make me feel so normal and well-adjusted by comparison
839167842436202496 2017-03-07 17:36:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman it looks like the addition is being added to the backside so hopefully the stop and frisk roller will stay
839167403472879617 2017-03-07 17:34:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman yeah i realized the rendering only shows the canal-facing side (i think?) so i just didn't see that part
839166051912925184 2017-03-07 17:29:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> However, I think "End Stop and Frisk Hands Off the Kids" should be preserved
839164295602647040 2017-03-07 17:22:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReporterLeslie @MC_NYC the period at the end of the sentence
839164176249548801 2017-03-07 17:21:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> I actually like the rendering of the new portion, which is of course being designed by fancy architects Herzog and de Meuron

839156165980340225 2017-03-07 16:49:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> As many aff hsg folks like to note, higher income units can also cross subsidize lower income ones than would typically be included
839155770121932804 2017-03-07 16:48:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> Interesting proposal to allow developers to average AMIs for LIHTC projects, which would allow higher income unitshttps://therealdeal.com/2017/03/06/how-one-tweak-to-affordable-housing-policy-could-make-a-big-difference-for-developers/

839154391932350464 2017-03-07 16:42:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katiebrenzel i mean the waterfront is already exorbitant so...
839152660636917760 2017-03-07 16:35:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kvelsey the houses are pretty crazy and people don't acknowledge that they must be, what, $5-10 million homes? (more???)
839146789269868545 2017-03-07 16:12:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markbyrnes525 i did a lot of research about UDC's budget a few years back. the feds slashed their budget quite a bit during the recession
839143683199021056 2017-03-07 16:00:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TamingofdeSchuh you learn so much about new york tho!! and then you can make subtle references in your essays about gentrification or w/e
839143513933635589 2017-03-07 15:59:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markbyrnes525 oh it's from his early days. that makes sense, lots of firms start out doing affordable housing
839142550866919424 2017-03-07 15:55:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TamingofdeSchuh i read it as part of a book club with a other reporters. it really helps to read it w/ a group who can hold you accountable
839142054022287361 2017-03-07 15:53:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markbyrnes525 why do you think it's Richard Meier?
839141821712384000 2017-03-07 15:52:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TamingofdeSchuh you should read it! and/or read the graphic novel based on it :)
839140002558849025 2017-03-07 15:45:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Their new building on Kingston Ave  in Crown Heights has rents starting at $1,600 for a private bedroom and shared living space (!!!)https://twitter.com/rachelholliday/status/839139078431997952
839134175059922949 2017-03-07 15:22:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty some of the new giants in DC are quite fancy, unlike the suburban giants of my youth
839133395305250818 2017-03-07 15:19:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jdawsey1 @JakeSherman are you eating in trump's hotel
839131815617114112 2017-03-07 15:13:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> why are you locked
839129989442326528 2017-03-07 15:05:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @juliakite honestly i am not an oreo connoisseur but that sounds kinda weird too
839129555633831936 2017-03-07 15:04:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty too spoiled by the Whole Foods and their organic knockoff snax
839129419751043072 2017-03-07 15:03:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty clearly you have not been in a regular grocery store in a while
839128737622945792 2017-03-07 15:00:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> Peep and Swedish fish oreos are genuinely horrifying - food that color should never pass your lips https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/839122613343514624
838980043820908544 2017-03-06 05:10:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @aymanndotcom i mean that's why i tweeted that. 33 thomas is windowless bc it's a telephone switching building
838979336279576576 2017-03-06 05:07:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @aymanndotcom ha it's because 33 thomas street is an NSA listening stationhttps://theintercept.com/2016/11/16/the-nsas-spy-hub-in-new-york-hidden-in-plain-sight/

838864816383098881 2017-03-06 21:32:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urban_loudmouth hey! we have a new URL for now while we work out some issues with our main domainhttp://www.yimbynews.com/
838855337226747905 2017-03-06 20:54:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @artichoko read the piece, they moved to Empire Stores
838853301147951108 2017-03-06 20:46:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> Of course Bjarke is moving his firm to Dumbo (where he owns a condo). They're taking West Elm's old space in 45 Mainhttp://ny.curbed.com/2017/3/6/14829568/bjarke-ingels-group-dumbo-offices
838850984382193668 2017-03-06 20:37:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca @tdfischer_ @alon_levy yes, hence why they were built into the ZR as incentives in an effort to soften effect of '61 zoning
838850152588771328 2017-03-06 20:33:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca @tdfischer_ @alon_levy the community benefits are often positive in and of themselves though
838849206081175555 2017-03-06 20:30:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly also i feel like we've already lowered our standards so far for carson that no one is surprised
838847241007812608 2017-03-06 20:22:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ similarly our approval for these projects involving rezonings take 7 months to a year (once formal land use process starts)
838847100930703362 2017-03-06 20:21:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ there were these two (not rich people opposition. city council & local NIMBYs) http://www.yimbynews.com/2016/08/city-council-votes-down-rezoning-for-15-story-inwood-apartment-building-at-4650-broadway.html http://sunnysidepost.com/phipps-barnett-avenue-proposal-is-dead-van-bramer-notified-by-developer
838846003931381760 2017-03-06 20:17:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ actually we have folks in brooklyn heights who were fighting a 100% affordable project - in a park no less - so....
838845594064076800 2017-03-06 20:15:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ pretty incredible that people are still fighting largely or 100% affordable projects then
838844434343153667 2017-03-06 20:11:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ but i agree with you that approvals need to be faster and that sometimes fighting for 100% affordable isn't feasible or worth it
838843904896155652 2017-03-06 20:09:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ the flipside of this is that once a site that could have been BMR is market-rate (esp in a $$ hood), you can't go back
838841541066096641 2017-03-06 19:59:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale yeah i think the sales guy at forbidden planet said something about Hunter S Thompson/acid trips/dystopia and i was like i'm sold
838836153562333185 2017-03-06 19:38:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale I've heard it's good and I was just wandering around in Forbidden Planet last night and it caught my eye

838819275020304386 2017-03-06 18:31:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brittneyplz i had a similar thing with crops but i didn't get dramatically thinner or anything. just a little more confident i think
838818965031890944 2017-03-06 18:30:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brittneyplz this is really cute
838810668509851648 2017-03-06 17:57:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> hahah yeah. i like it when they have good guests though, like Shane Bauer

838789665452883969 2017-03-06 16:33:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm biased bc I live in Crown Heights, but I think city's arguments for opening even more shelters here are weakhttp://www.yimbynews.com/2017/03/citing-fair-share-rules-crown-heights-residents-fight-planned-shelter-on-bergen-street.html
838788236080185344 2017-03-06 16:27:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chayesmatthew @RosaGoldensohn you mean that the poor maintenance rather than vandalism thing?

838161080513867778 2017-03-04 22:55:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's a pretty low bar to say your homeless policy and its execution could be worse, especially compared to what, the recession?
838159674256031744 2017-03-04 22:50:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> "We suck slightly less at being transparent than Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani" is not a selling point, guys
838159444273950721 2017-03-04 22:49:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> If your justification not giving neighborhoods notice abt shelters is "previous administrations were even worse" maybe time to consider that

838137560157290496 2017-03-04 21:22:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism ....was deeply unpopular. DHS didn't have good answers for why here and not elsewhere
838137378782994433 2017-03-04 21:21:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism and the idea that more shelters should be sited here bc 2,400 ppl in shelter system list our CD as last known address...
838137126768238593 2017-03-04 21:20:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism this meeting was very raucous, like 2.5 hours of rachel's tweets.
838128142837510144 2017-03-04 20:44:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @myhairisblue congrats!!
838125304241610752 2017-03-04 20:33:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne oh that was horrible but no
838124984409206788 2017-03-04 20:32:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ @SoBendito yeah i'm also confused about what you mean by massive public investment
838124600387059712 2017-03-04 20:30:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @gabydvj @DaveCoIon oh i'm not sure i saw that. anyway i'm just a little local reporter, not tryna attract any attention
838121798596177920 2017-03-04 20:19:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> tfw you catch up on the leftist twitter drama and you wish you never had
838121525848977412 2017-03-04 20:18:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @riccoja @SoBendito @smithsj or just be regularly searching...either way a big waste of time
838121279161044992 2017-03-04 20:17:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @riccoja @SoBendito @smithsj he must have a tweetdeck column set up for this guy's name. kind of like how i have one for crown heights
838120587281199108 2017-03-04 20:14:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @riccoja @SoBendito @smithsj oh never mind, i found the thread. i am not about that life
838119814136803328 2017-03-04 20:11:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @riccoja @SoBendito @smithsj wait what is this about??
838110993234395136 2017-03-04 19:36:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm where was he from?
838091914775834626 2017-03-04 18:20:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> Another highlight: the block association prez stood up and said this is a landmark block and the facade of this bldg is atrocious
838091262536400897 2017-03-04 18:18:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JustTheMax @RosaGoldensohn thanks Rosa!
838089531555475458 2017-03-04 18:11:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JustTheMax you know DHS hates releasing data
838085035643318274 2017-03-04 17:53:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JustTheMax http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170301/REAL_ESTATE/170309989
838084479616958464 2017-03-04 17:51:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JustTheMax I think it can be FOILed. Didn't Crains have a map @RosaGoldensohn ?
838084266147864577 2017-03-04 17:50:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JustTheMax I'm not sure if that's public but they were referencing that
838082393592463360 2017-03-04 17:43:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> DHS claims it will close five shelters in 36th council district over next few years but is vague about locations for some
838076370894929920 2017-03-04 17:19:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> Folks feel that our council districtis burdened with too many shelters. This will be the 20th in Crown Heights and Bed Stuy
838075597045841921 2017-03-04 17:16:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> DHS meeting about the new shelter in Crown Heights is predictably angry and packed
838060432732602368 2017-03-04 16:15:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes yeah I've been reading her for years
838053249999650817 2017-03-04 15:47:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn yup. they were responsive when i was asking them about their open shop study, lol
838052884159819776 2017-03-04 15:45:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn where is this

838050893782220803 2017-03-04 15:37:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn i had another non union group who didn't even respond to my email about immigrant membership...

837855299033841664 2017-03-03 02:40:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC but yeah that is a lot of paint
837850286286860289 2017-03-03 02:20:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC true but if you can't pay bail you can end up spending real time in rikers
837847077866590208 2017-03-03 02:08:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC but I feel like the threshold for felony graff charges and potential jail time is kinda low. Like $10K?

837770608003919877 2017-03-03 21:04:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne @mekosoff honestly i was hoping for something much more exciting based on that subject line

837732349232181248 2017-03-03 18:32:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy kinda yes, but consider the source https://www.amazon.com/Lonely-City-Adventures-Being-Alone/dp/1250039576 and fact that they're discussing Cat Marnell (for whom it might fit)

836636752651640832 2017-02-28 17:58:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler @gabydvj tho if you're itemizing/deducting a lot it might be more than $200. If you have simple-ish taxes it's not bad
836635928886140928 2017-02-28 17:55:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler @gabydvj yeah for what it costs you can hire an accountant and still prob save yourself like $50.

836254526579552260 2017-02-27 16:39:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC it doesn't seem like that has been conveyed well to the co-op owners if so
836253974588243972 2017-02-27 16:37:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro yes, depending on where you draw the borders. but if you can afford a house at current asking prices you could prob afford a car

836248039081848833 2017-02-27 16:14:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i'd love to see something from IBO that would analyze whether increased maintenance $ & full tax break would offset the cap
836247774886756354 2017-02-27 16:13:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism idk, it seems strange to me that they're capping the sale prices if they're concerned about co-op buildings in distress
836245735742005252 2017-02-27 16:04:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @the_zim were the co-op owners not represented on the task force that drafted this bill?

836243003480113153 2017-02-27 15:54:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC yes
836240650408456192 2017-02-27 15:44:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> It does seem odd that the city is concerned about distressed co-op buildings but still wants to cap sale prices
836240190314274816 2017-02-27 15:42:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> The Post piece is a bit....misleading, but @the_zim did some v helpful reporting on this last yearhttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160927/west-harlem/hdfc-price-caps-regulatory-agreement-affordable-co-ops

835938180658528256 2017-02-26 19:42:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes i would imagine the architects renovating/building homes in a town like that would be rather precious about their work

835219686396690432 2017-02-24 20:07:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder @DavidKlion @schadenfraade yeah & communities it's supposed to help don't want it bc they see it for what it is
835218537744584704 2017-02-24 20:03:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder @DavidKlion @schadenfraade in terms of bang for your buck - esp for city tax payers - BQX isn't a good deal
835216626400231426 2017-02-24 19:55:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> And protesters are planning to rally outside King's LI office to oppose Trump immigration policies this afternoon! http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/immigration-rally-planned-outside-peter-king-s-office-1.13172638https://twitter.com/natemcdermott/status/835213368634064896
835214100032544768 2017-02-24 19:45:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> "boyfriends"
835205917419388928 2017-02-24 19:13:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KonradPutzier @_willparker_ a resounding endorsement
835196407585910785 2017-02-24 18:35:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK can we hang out
835195835944157185 2017-02-24 18:32:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK are you back for the weekend?
835195026191810560 2017-02-24 18:29:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EH_Preservation approaching the project as if the only option is defeat it or accept what the developers propose is quite limited
835194925310431232 2017-02-24 18:29:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EH_Preservation the whole point of public review is that people can demand a better deal for the neighborhood. i'm saying use that power
835192857648582656 2017-02-24 18:21:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EH_Preservation the map says it's at the very southern edge of her district.
835191588036947969 2017-02-24 18:16:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EH_Preservation the dev is probably going to get this thru ULURP whether you like it or not. MMV is the one who decides how it turns out.
835184706178138112 2017-02-24 17:48:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple they already make me turn off my ad blocker which is annoying enough. the auto-play video ads are pretty bad
835184221673127937 2017-02-24 17:46:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple sadly i can't read the other editorials bc i've hit their paywall
835184158586646536 2017-02-24 17:46:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i mean if people were taking my articles out of context for their ads i would put them on blast too
835183879665373185 2017-02-24 17:45:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i enjoyed it
835182739217387520 2017-02-24 17:40:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> L.A. Times comes out against Measure S, which would impose a 2-yr ban on all projects that require a zoning changehttp://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-measure-s-mailers-20170224-story.html
835176896807776257 2017-02-24 17:17:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EH_Preservation if city or feds would like to kick in more subsidy this would be less of an issue, but there are certain economics at play
835176727714414594 2017-02-24 17:17:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EH_Preservation so the problem here is that if the building is smaller, it is harder to finance lower income affordable units
835176422104838145 2017-02-24 17:15:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EH_Preservation fact that places like UWS and W Village have staved off a lot of development is part of what is pushing up E Harlem rents
835176078327042050 2017-02-24 17:14:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EH_Preservation i have seen east harlem. and i don't think it's right that West Village gets to fight off development while E Harlem can't
835175601141067776 2017-02-24 17:12:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EH_Preservation would you prefer a shorter building with subsidized units that are less affordable?
835174962034053121 2017-02-24 17:10:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, opposing a project based on its height in a neighborhood that's already full of high rises is a bit silly
835168426586947585 2017-02-24 16:44:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @miller_stephen i thought in cases like this developers have helped fund construction of the schools
835168279937298432 2017-02-24 16:43:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @miller_stephen developer is paying for the playground though i assume? you don't think they're kicking in $$ for schools?
835166824664817664 2017-02-24 16:37:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> Which, if you've been following the Trump admin at all, is clearly low on the list of things they want to fund
835166691277606914 2017-02-24 16:37:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> I don't know how much lower than $580 a month (40% AMI) new construction rents can go, unless the feds wanna kick in a lot more money
835165291277651969 2017-02-24 16:31:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> But they would probably hate it just the same at 40 stories or whatever cc @MarketUrbanism
835164175898935300 2017-02-24 16:27:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> If it were 20 stories shorter would they be ok with it? But would the developer still include the two schools, park, and low-income housing?
835163886332563456 2017-02-24 16:26:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> Neighbors don't want a 68-story tower. But if we're gonna build it, might as well be on top of the new subway linehttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170223/east-harlem/96th-street-development-avalonbay-community-board-11

834989204400656384 2017-02-23 04:51:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair I agree except replace Oreos with Girl Scout cookies
834922675986386944 2017-02-23 00:27:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samstecky this is very old-school tabloid in tone but less well-written than i would expect from a traditional paper
834921025636823040 2017-02-23 00:20:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samstecky so this guy is like a columnist? this awkward first person essay thing is weird
834917324675244032 2017-02-23 00:06:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly is that not true in prospect heights
834916320395284484 2017-02-23 00:02:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @jbarro @MarketUrbanism Brooklyn Bridge is historic and Kosciuszko is not. and yes, they deemed it structurally unsound in 90s
834915041224888321 2017-02-23 23:57:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @jbarro @MarketUrbanism it was.

834912657564106752 2017-02-23 23:47:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @jbarro @MarketUrbanism fwiw it needed to be replaced. it shook and was deemed unstable, was possibly poorly built to begin with

834884517206843393 2017-02-23 21:55:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay yes i hope so too
834883866150187008 2017-02-23 21:53:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay kind of
834882843448864768 2017-02-23 21:49:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay let's just say the circumstances surrounding the "sabbatical" are largely beyond our control (or at least mine)
834879044579704834 2017-02-23 21:34:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> Sometimes I wonder if WSJ is developing some kind of special section on people buying southern plantations https://www.wsj.com/articles/financier-pays-about-40-million-for-quail-hunting-plantation-1487088815pic.twitter.com/uZdjSW5Uf5

834865120203333634 2017-02-23 20:38:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder have you ever been checked by CBP while disembarking a domestic flight? I certainly never have
834856096493879296 2017-02-23 20:02:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn oh wait its a synagogue, i see

834849524032094212 2017-02-23 19:36:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickmartin yeah i guess it might be less of an issue if most of the border land in AZ is controlled by feds and tribes
834847117462077440 2017-02-23 19:27:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeSherman @ZekeJMiller pretty legendary abandoned spot these days
834831005504659457 2017-02-23 18:23:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jaimealyse @BrooklynSpoke right but immigration officers checking people's documents while disembarking a domestic flight is highly unusual

834796675151454208 2017-02-23 16:06:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday you deserve a vacation

834547758463844352 2017-02-22 23:37:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas one thing that annoyed me  - neither MTA nor DOT could even send me the presentation MTA officials gave at the 1st mtg last wk

834546910895734784 2017-02-22 23:34:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jdavidgoodman this is from NYPD or the mayor's office? Did they say what the revised cost per day was?

834081749093249025 2017-02-21 16:46:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @ReporterLeslie @SoBendito you mean from the perspective of it being financially feasible to keep the stables?

833539069846097920 2017-02-19 04:49:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JDavidsonNYC in January NYPD said $500K a day. I think Schumer just sucks at fact checking.http://newyorkyimby.com/2017/01/how-much-money-is-donald-trumps-security-costing-new-york-city.html

832627055325876225 2017-02-17 16:25:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> NYSHCR keep mentioning $400 million is going to be spent renovating Ocean Bay in  Rockaways, most of which is fed $$https://www.wsj.com/articles/ny-housing-authority-bringing-private-investors-into-far-rockaways-project-1483051823

832625662808567809 2017-02-17 16:20:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> State legislators keep asking how state actually spent $100 million on NYCHA. They want to know why roofs/structural issues weren't repaired

832621364137906176 2017-02-17 16:02:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katiebrenzel i heard him say it's bc we're developing more affordable housing, i must have missed the actual BdB mention
832620804722397187 2017-02-17 16:00:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is actually a really good idea
832619657412571136 2017-02-17 15:56:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> State Sen. Diane Savino asks whether state could offer zoning bonuses in exchange for developers making repairs on NYCHA projects

832617839093747712 2017-02-17 15:48:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> Every time a state legislator asks NYSHCR about 421-a, Jamie Rubin goes "I think you mean the affordable housing new york program" WE GET IT
832616878673584131 2017-02-17 15:45:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> TIL NYS has programs and laws in place specifically for folks living in trailer parks, including a "co-op" program http://www.nyshcr.org/Topics/Home/BuyYourManufacturedHomePark.htm

832613531262603265 2017-02-17 15:31:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> I find this v hard to believe. Only 200 landlords, out of estimated 50K, were ignoring the rent-stabilization rules while getting J-51?

832312896990408709 2017-02-16 19:37:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> Guys, @WillBredderman just unrolled a little NYC-focused history of the FHA/red-lining in my mentionshttps://twitter.com/WillBredderman/status/832307491975344129
832311246804365313 2017-02-16 19:30:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nicolegelinas @stateofthecity i mean in the sense that their $10 million apartments are less valuable than they used to be. otherwise no.
832310821199941632 2017-02-16 19:28:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz the last time i rode the chinatown bus they were just pulling off at random exits on the turnpike and picking people up
832310428671811584 2017-02-16 19:27:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz good luck not tipping over on the jersey turnpike
832310034579279872 2017-02-16 19:25:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz i'm surprised the chinatown bus still runs
832309443463434241 2017-02-16 19:23:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @WillBredderman @NoahHurowitz yes. i think Will was just pointing out some nuances. the maps & notes are fascinating https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=13/40.6489/-73.9571&opacity=0.8&city=brooklyn-ny
832308377699102723 2017-02-16 19:19:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @WillBredderman sure. i think places that had covenants in place were actually rated higher by FHA (green?)
832307794674085890 2017-02-16 19:16:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @WillBredderman ah yes the covenants played a role too but they are separate from red-lining, since we're talking local vs fed
832307160688295938 2017-02-16 19:14:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> The end of that press conference was rather sudden
832306949064634368 2017-02-16 19:13:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz red-lining was done by the FHA, not individual property owners
832306570977488896 2017-02-16 19:12:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford did he say two specifically? i don't remember. i heard him say chicago and that's it

832306013114081280 2017-02-16 19:09:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> Trump talking about crime in the "inner cities": "They lock themselves in apartments, and they're afraid to come out during the day"

829451539940937728 2017-02-08 22:07:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> Hiding your face isn't a precursor to committing a crime. Nor is it your problem if cops can't ID you from video footage after the fact
829451022888267776 2017-02-08 22:05:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ and if cops are trying to arrest you post facto based on video and can't ID you bc of the mask, that shouldn't be your problem
829450413799792645 2017-02-08 22:02:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ and the cops are often shooting their own video...
829450322145746945 2017-02-08 22:02:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ and it's valid to want to hide your face during a protest where thousands of people are usually snapping photos
829450181326229504 2017-02-08 22:01:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ what? no. it's just an extra charge for people trying to hide their identity in any context, which is dumb
829429822573146112 2017-02-08 20:40:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dahvnyc huh. i guess they got office space there after i left brownstoner

829388093228797958 2017-02-08 17:55:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka i feel like they should have talked to folks from companies like Google, where they reward people for being engaged

829376331662098432 2017-02-08 17:08:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @JakeAnbinder @smithsj the racism towards the Roma is a huge issue that seems linked to classist concepts about panhandling/theft
829375254191624192 2017-02-08 17:04:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder i feel mixed about this since they might be a good fundraising thing. are fewer people giving to the panhandlers post-meter?

827340626207334405 2017-02-02 02:19:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ceaweaver or do you mean the mayor claims there is no subsidy that's available for this project?
827338490467725312 2017-02-02 02:10:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ceaweaver both dev and cumbo claim no city subsidy right now but cumbo is pushing for one
827333565633400836 2017-02-02 01:51:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> However, Cumbo says she is pushing for city subsidy (currently none is promised) so the project can be more affordable

827331675399061506 2017-02-02 01:43:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ceaweaver idk if what she's saying is accurate or not. she might mean the $$ available to make it affordable to lower AMI

827331072023203841 2017-02-02 01:41:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> Without it, she notes, the project will not move forward. With the income Trump admin and Ben Carson heading HUD, funding is unclear

826475587065827328 2017-01-31 17:01:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC and part of the reason, according to folks who live there, is that cost of living/buying a house is extremely cheap

826459317863927810 2017-01-31 15:57:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie @MarketUrbanism no? it'd be hard to compare union vs. non-union construction deaths w/ other cities if they don't have strong unions
826459015240613889 2017-01-31 15:55:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie @MarketUrbanism maybe philly and chicago?
826458678916239360 2017-01-31 15:54:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie @MarketUrbanism it'd be tough to compare, since who else has both our level of construction activity & union strength?
826454851894771712 2017-01-31 15:39:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie @MarketUrbanism whether that's bc there are simply more of them or because they have less oversight (or both)
826454748517826561 2017-01-31 15:39:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie @MarketUrbanism i guess it's hard to separate correlation and causation, if 75% of construction deaths happened on shorter projects
826451732683177984 2017-01-31 15:27:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie however bc short bldgs have less oversight/aren't governed by union regs they tend to have more accidentshttps://commercialobserver.com/2017/01/why-shorter-construction-projects-are-more-dangerous-than-taller-ones/
826451070025080832 2017-01-31 15:24:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie taller buildings require more construction supervision/sometimes call for union labor, so short buildings are cheaper
826450275514929153 2017-01-31 15:21:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie it sounds like it might. for us it depends heavily on the neighborhood and the height of the structure, and now on new 421-a rules
826449590085963776 2017-01-31 15:18:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie does that include the cost of the land
826449271591432199 2017-01-31 15:17:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie the mayor has prioritized affordable development in ENY so a big portion of our citywide housing subsidies are going there
826448970746585089 2017-01-31 15:16:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie ours are also extremely high. but we also have enormous tax breaks and large housing subsidies to build in hoods like ENY

823620170216341504 2017-01-23 19:55:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> This inauguration crowd thing is incredible. It's demoralizing to... show that the mall was like 80% empty?
823614770226089984 2017-01-23 19:33:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Spicer seems confused about whether WH press office has released a doc certifying Trump has resigned from his businesses
823614104619384832 2017-01-23 19:31:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> Who asked the pro-life question?

823612661229350912 2017-01-23 19:25:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> Why are we arguing about the BLS unemployment numbers during a WH press briefing?!
823612009619091456 2017-01-23 19:22:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vinbarone the 40+ year old ones are on the A, C, 3, and R lines?
823609749904224260 2017-01-23 19:14:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> Oh my god we're still talking about the bust of MLK
823609550666432512 2017-01-23 19:13:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> Spicer's new tack is that everyone can make mistakes, and admits that incorrect DC metro ridership numbers came from inaugural committee

823539752938913793 2017-01-23 14:35:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder @Urbablurb Hearst Tower was built nearly 15 years ago, so idk how much construction costs have gone up since then
823538167961808897 2017-01-23 14:29:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Urbablurb @JakeAnbinder worth noting, however, that neither of those buildings are in high crime precincts that desperately need $$ & help
823537964160585728 2017-01-23 14:28:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Urbablurb @JakeAnbinder i wonder how much the security costs. and that big, self-irrigating wall o plants!
823537569367474177 2017-01-23 14:27:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@Urbablurb just reminded we spent $950 mill on new NYPD academy https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/nyregion/950-million-police-academy-simulates-the-mean-streets.html?mtrref=www.google.com & $800 mill on call centerhttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/nyregion/an-imposing-building-that-hums-with-life-saving-capacity.html
823536956449705984 2017-01-23 14:24:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Urbablurb true! i forgot about the call center. you mean that crazy windowless one in the bronx. cost $800 million https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/nyregion/an-imposing-building-that-hums-with-life-saving-capacity.html

823533993819836416 2017-01-23 14:12:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @SallyGold so the developer would have to pay the $45/hour wage and certify it with HPD to qualify?
823533065448341504 2017-01-23 14:09:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you're also wondering why the city isn't spending that money on policing, outreach, drug rehab centers, homeless shelters... I am too.

822533744410165248 2017-01-20 19:58:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj and it can cost tens of thousands to replace those plate glass windows... who are we really trying to punish here?

822488312296382464 2017-01-20 16:57:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @britbyrd1 @alon_levy esp in evening, they have one direction go red for ~30 sec while other still green. can be a lil dangerous

822485727774642178 2017-01-20 16:47:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @britbyrd1 there aren't pedestrian islands in the middle tho
822484757196009473 2017-01-20 16:43:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy yes, mostly. there are schools, Brooklyn Museum, occasional illegal retail conversion
822483362761871360 2017-01-20 16:38:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy depends which subway you take to the city. when i take the 3, i cross EP. when i take the A or LIRR, I cross Atlantic
822480919017717761 2017-01-20 16:28:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy common i guess! it would depend which side you live on (north or south). heavy traffic during rush hour, moderate all other times
822480155729858560 2017-01-20 16:25:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj @alon_levy uh what about it? QB is a lot different from Eastern Parkway

822210773351010305 2017-01-19 22:34:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons now cuomo just has to step up and do the same!
822210669546262532 2017-01-19 22:34:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons worth noting that the current admin has put quite a bit of funding toward ensuring all low-income tenants get a lawyer
822209185920274433 2017-01-19 22:28:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons there issues with DOB being corrupt, DoF has basically zero oversight, v poor enforcement of rent regulation/421-a/J-51
822208948472348672 2017-01-19 22:27:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons and many of the things people are afraid of would be corrected/mediated by proper enforcement of the law, from city & state
822208695908139008 2017-01-19 22:26:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons so some folks do oppose development on grounds that are basically racist/classist. others do because they're afraid
822207584836919299 2017-01-19 22:22:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons right. yeah i cover all five boroughs and it realllyyy varies dramatically by neighborhood/ethnic group/elected officials
822207115750154245 2017-01-19 22:20:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons yes. one problem is that folks who've never covered real estate in depth don't always understand  impact of certain policies
822206291003273216 2017-01-19 22:17:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons but really the thing that i try to grapple with is how do you encourage good urban planning/ development that is positive
822205088680865794 2017-01-19 22:12:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons so they naturally assume all development is bad and scary, and uniformly equate it with gentrification/displacement
822204970749534208 2017-01-19 22:11:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons even here in new york, most of this stuff is severely under-covered and people don't understand what's going on
822204795926749185 2017-01-19 22:11:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons i try to throw light on housing policies and think about how we can encourage dev in the neighborhoods that need it most
822203813335617536 2017-01-19 22:07:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons ...which is a discussion that much of the real estate industry unfortunately continues to ignore
822203639393583105 2017-01-19 22:06:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons after being on this beat for a few years, i think what's important is talking about how we can house the poorest folks...
822203151956766726 2017-01-19 22:04:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanFitzsimmons sure. i am not pro-dev in all instances, and in fact i think it's v important to hold developers and the city accountable
822194255380774912 2017-01-19 21:29:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dahvnyc yeah i don't even bother. i have notifications turned off for people i don't follow, so w/e

822160964514643969 2017-01-19 19:17:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> The idea that anyone could get away with shutting down a metro line during Inauguration Day security is hilarious
822159241209409537 2017-01-19 19:10:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> When you try googling metro closures and you find the garb infowars story about protest organizershttp://www.infowars.com/radical-leftists-target-dc-metro-rail-line-to-block-inauguration-access/

822138798192676864 2017-01-19 17:48:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism also you know the CB's vote doesn't matter because Levin is going to approve this anyway

822131434278318082 2017-01-19 17:19:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @mikecherepko also clearly any building in Dumbo will be for the "uber-rich" regardless of whether it's rentals or condos
822130832332701696 2017-01-19 17:17:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism this developer's PR  wanted me to change my story about his project. clearly his sordid family history didn't even matter!

822114854953746432 2017-01-19 16:13:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas but it seems like we should take these promises of $10 trillion in cuts with a gigantic amount of salt

819700941599469569 2017-01-12 00:21:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen yeah that sounds awesome though certainly increases the chances of drunk people drowning or whatever
819699936803647488 2017-01-12 00:17:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj @MosesNYC not if you're using flavored vape liquid. i had a roommate who made his own vape juice and just ugh ugh ugh

819698176609370112 2017-01-12 00:10:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy in the modern building code they are fairly large - like min 550 sf. but in older buildings, you never know! converted SROs, etc
819696608799506432 2017-01-12 00:04:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> Honestly if it's 400 square feet that's bigger than a lot of people's studios

819634555200163840 2017-01-12 19:58:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> So glad @DaveCoIon reminded me about when JCats tried to revamp his 14th Street Gristedes into "Trader John's"http://gothamist.com/2009/01/10/nice_try_trader_darwin_gristedes_su.php

819320651383271427 2017-01-11 23:10:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @timdonnelly the deadspin post was good too http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/craven-reporters-scold-buzzfeed-for-reporting-news-1791071084 but they totally fail to address the verification issue

819300644012048387 2017-01-11 21:51:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> Congress has only approved $7 million in federal funds to reimburse the city so far
819300202075000832 2017-01-11 21:49:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> And I know this is not strictly ~real estate~ but I like to expand the content from time to time

819299355861598218 2017-01-11 21:46:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> By the time Trump gets sworn in, the city will have spent $37 million protecting him and his family http://newyorkyimby.com/2017/01/how-much-money-is-donald-trumps-security-costing-new-york-city.html
819298792654651401 2017-01-11 21:43:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin i'm not a real estate lawyer so \_()_/ https://twitter.com/thecitywanderer/status/819297529993031684. and like i said, unclear GSA would enforce it here...
819298086749093899 2017-01-11 21:41:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin it would be cool if the feds sued him for this since the lease is fairly strict, but i highly doubt it
819297860307087360 2017-01-11 21:40:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin no one has answered my burning question, which is does this arrangement violate his 66-yr lease for Trump International D.C.?
819297529993031684 2017-01-11 21:38:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> Last month, Bloomberg said transferring Trump's D.C. hotel to the kids doesn't remove him from business enough https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-12-20/selling-trump-s-washington-hotel-to-end-conflict-may-mean-losspic.twitter.com/nQinTvovL2

819263268288155657 2017-01-11 19:22:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> That photo of the Watergate on fire illustrates how ugly it is when you're passing by. But somehow it's ok from abovepic.twitter.com/6cttn8tLkn
819251480859381761 2017-01-11 18:35:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj is this different from what you normally do
819233856851214336 2017-01-11 17:25:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> Amazing that after 30+ years of dealing with New York City tabloid coverage, Trump is still so thin-skinned with journalists
819231182172934145 2017-01-11 17:15:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jcohenwrites people who have spent way, way too much time covering trump, probably
819229720785063936 2017-01-11 17:09:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> Wait what was the question? Lindsay Graham will send him a bill for what?
819229502224089089 2017-01-11 17:08:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> Trump says Buzzfeed is a "failing pile of garbage" and "will suffer the consequences" for writing about Russian oppo doc.

819226312263004161 2017-01-11 16:55:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> Oh great now Trump is defending Rex Tillerson, by saying that another oil guy vouched for him
819225759495651328 2017-01-11 16:53:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> Trump is going to voluntarily donate all proceeds from foreign gov'ts to the Treasury
819224990214221824 2017-01-11 16:50:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thomaswood that doesn't even include the loans he took out to finance the renovation...
819224844185305089 2017-01-11 16:49:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thomaswood I think the lease with the GSA is 99 years and quite complex. I don't think transferring it is that simple
819224701792874496 2017-01-11 16:49:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> Especially on the Old Post Office/D.C. hotel
819224560830738432 2017-01-11 16:48:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> "Why not divest?" Real answer: "I would lose too much money"
819224330647244805 2017-01-11 16:47:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thomaswood i'm not a real estate lawyer, nor have i seen the lease, so idk
819224177081196544 2017-01-11 16:47:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> If he doesn't see that money while he's in office, I guess so... but they might have to redo that lease
819223817876865024 2017-01-11 16:45:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> So if Trump's D.C. hotel is transferred to the trust, will he not be violating his hotel lease with the feds?
819222993066979328 2017-01-11 16:42:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is ridiculoushttps://twitter.com/BostonGlobe/status/819222863148367873
819222035230584832 2017-01-11 16:38:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> I hope someone at this presser asks!
819220887299850241 2017-01-11 16:34:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Is Trump ever going to discuss disentangling himself from his real estate business, or are we gonna talk about Russia the whole time?
819218402359255040 2017-01-11 16:24:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz we also have a lot fewer wood frames than north BK, which it turns out made a big difference
819218253641871360 2017-01-11 16:23:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz true!
819218108997074946 2017-01-11 16:23:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz though the irony is that Crown Heights never burned like that. the early 90s riots weren't really like mid-70s Bushwick ones
819217755379531781 2017-01-11 16:21:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i mean i understand idea that it's unhelpful, bc the name of my neighborhood is literally associated with 25-year-old riots
819214218708840448 2017-01-11 16:07:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i live in a neighborhood where people still go "isn't that where the riots happened?" so...

819210749411213312 2017-01-11 15:53:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CahnEmily he's really uncompelling. he sounds like he wasn't prepped at all, has no idea how to answer most of these questions
819205644486053888 2017-01-11 15:33:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JodyShenn @helenbholmes i am sad we made you delete your original tweet
819204645583290368 2017-01-11 15:29:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes @JodyShenn it's a very anonymous form of glory, lol
819204553778282496 2017-01-11 15:29:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes @JodyShenn right, so this is what i'm talking about! we don't mean scraps as in minute facts, we mean over-covered stories
819202370722734081 2017-01-11 15:20:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes @JodyShenn it really depends what the scraps are. we mean stories that tend to blow up but aren't v important in the long run
819201995785588736 2017-01-11 15:19:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes and if you work for a place driven by clicks/and lack the skills/time/resources to find better stories, you're scrap-clamoring
819201821336072192 2017-01-11 15:18:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes yeah def. but knocking the whole concept of beat reporting is problematic bc many folks in our generation simply never learned
819201439939657729 2017-01-11 15:16:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes ha, that's ok, it's not for everyone! and the kind of personalities who excel at it often aren't good at other kinds of roles
819200791231795200 2017-01-11 15:14:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes ...what is even important to focus on for long-term investigative work. and that's leaving aside the skills it teaches you...
819200621328945152 2017-01-11 15:13:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes if you're beat reporter surfacing things that aren't well-covered (i.e. anything local), w/o daily stuff, you don't know...
819200090296479744 2017-01-11 15:11:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes i guess there are 2 separate issues here - (1) need to generate daily content and (2) certain "beats" being very over-covered
819199771252498432 2017-01-11 15:10:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes when NYT started paring back their metro coverage, this was it sounded like...
819199468612546560 2017-01-11 15:09:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes i agree re: trump but not necessarily about beat reporting in general. i think it really depends on the beat
819194423384936448 2017-01-11 14:49:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman for what?
819194183118454784 2017-01-11 14:48:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz also re: more recent arson in NYC http://nymag.com/realestate/features/21339/
819193107682050048 2017-01-11 14:43:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz it made sense to me there because a lot of the buildings were literally burned...but i'm sure arson/pop'n loss also involved
819192895030890497 2017-01-11 14:43:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz reminds me of how my parents used to always say a lot of northern D.C. had never "recovered from the riots"
819191395290382337 2017-01-11 14:37:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @MarketUrbanism @slowboring this sounds interesting!! i would love to read

818938373851189248 2017-01-10 21:51:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> Whenever I meet someone and they say, "I know so much about you from twitter," I feel deep dread
818938143806197761 2017-01-10 21:50:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly is this actually your cat?
818937832173666304 2017-01-10 21:49:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad i figure it's unlikely that trespassers would be spotted like that, so i assume it's either drunks, homeless, or someone who fell
818931428629053441 2017-01-10 21:24:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad i always wonder about these. do you think they're usually homeless folks?
818916765249978368 2017-01-10 20:25:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn street closures, additional traffic, having lots of folks from protesters to media tying up streets around Trump Tower
818915270316163073 2017-01-10 20:19:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Riders alliance organizer says he's concerned about effect of Trump security on inter-borough bus routes and riders
818907715577593856 2017-01-10 19:49:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> The head of the Fifth Ave BID thinks stores near Trump Tower may have lost more than $40 million in revenue
818903966377459718 2017-01-10 19:34:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> NYPD: Feds have never reimbursed the city for presidential visit costs. Only similar precedent is being reimbursed when U.N. is in session
818903500096618497 2017-01-10 19:33:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timkrepp yup
818902932737458176 2017-01-10 19:30:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> The security burden around Trump Tower is larger than what Secret Service could provide, sez NYPD
818902496194265089 2017-01-10 19:29:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> Garodnick asks if we could make a special NYPD unit for Trump Tower, like the one for Times Square? Kehoe says they'll look into it
818901660303052800 2017-01-10 19:25:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@JulissaFerreras asks whether the city could just tell the feds we can't afford Trump security? Would Secret Service fill the gap?
818901136249933828 2017-01-10 19:23:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik ah typo, thanks
818899011772026884 2017-01-10 19:15:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> L. Daneek Miller asks about how presidential motorcades will affect highways and local streets. D.C. folks know how exhausting they are.
818896360615378951 2017-01-10 19:04:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> NYPD's Kehoe acknowledges that they'd be willing to let neighboring businesses know when Trump is moving/there's a presidential frozen zone
818895419262566400 2017-01-10 19:00:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> All they'll say is they'll do those things if they feel it's necessary
818895089988726785 2017-01-10 18:59:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> NYPD hints that they wouldn't take orders from Secret Service on closing streets or adding officers near Trump Tower, but not totally clear
818851549564850178 2017-01-10 16:06:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabrielabarkho i'm trying to join it but my health insurance is screwed up 
818849508880748545 2017-01-10 15:58:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly extremely Alex Balk content
818841776337391616 2017-01-10 15:27:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj they don't say who would be HUD secretary but I'd bet money on Booker
818835776217747456 2017-01-10 15:03:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa fortunately he's so unlikable - especially to people outside NY - that i think we're safe from a cuomo nomination
818821794316619776 2017-01-10 14:08:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin then again, the billion+ dollars worth of debt kushner has on 666 Fifth Ave hasn't come due yet, so the other shoe might drop
818821185152708608 2017-01-10 14:05:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin i guess! they just did a much better job of holding onto the family fortune/property and investing it than trump has
818820623032000512 2017-01-10 14:03:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin trump owns interest/ long-term leases on a fair amount of nyc real estate. but kushner controls morehttps://therealdeal.com/2017/01/06/meet-the-obscure-german-magnates-who-actually-own-trumps-most-valuable-building/
818818165002162176 2017-01-10 13:53:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @fivefifths can you elaborate a little bit?
818686472618471424 2017-01-09 05:10:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> Then again, I'm sure Trump has never set foot in the Bronx except to go to his golf course...
818679848185036800 2017-01-09 04:44:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, weird that a president visited shocking devastation in South Bronx and all he did was make encouraging noises http://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/06/archives/carter-takes-sobering-trip-to-south-bronx-carter-finds-hope-amid.htmlpic.twitter.com/HKARgHXJ18

818663739633369090 2017-01-09 03:40:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NiallStanage are they bringing marion barry back from the dead or what
818661303782952961 2017-01-09 03:30:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro i'm sad that people like this never seem to go on Fixer Upper
818659333420490753 2017-01-09 03:22:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly omg
818653407045124096 2017-01-09 02:59:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @weareyourfek i assume we're talking about this guy?pic.twitter.com/qIagD9XgB1
818648628667551744 2017-01-09 02:40:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @slowboring maybe once you factor in the mortgage subsidy from the feds. i think charlotte street was kind of PR-driven
818645202369970177 2017-01-09 02:26:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samstecky he's had quite a dayhttps://twitter.com/2AvSagas/status/818595196254490624
818644782058762241 2017-01-09 02:25:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @slowboring wasn't particularly cheap for the developers. and it wasn't the only project that was built that way at the time
818639265001275393 2017-01-09 02:03:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Or explaining my own opinions to me!
818639148429017090 2017-01-09 02:02:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> Where would I be without Men Explaining My Own Beat to Me on Twitter
818632790027759620 2017-01-09 01:37:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @slowboring read the piece! They also a mention a federal mortgage program that expired right as Charlotte was finished
818604654166679552 2017-01-09 23:45:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samstecky realllyyyy so that's kind of the opposite of Bill de Blasio, who is pretty hated by white folks in the outer boros
818603321917313025 2017-01-09 23:40:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samstecky i guess i thought Rahm was v unlikable as mayor (which is maybe true?). but like BdB, i'm assuming he has no real challenger?
818603141449084933 2017-01-09 23:39:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samstecky clearly we both assume the worst! i suspect we notice the most negative/outrageous coverage as outsiders
818600465466331138 2017-01-09 23:28:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samstecky i guess BdB isn't far off but unlikely he's getting defeated eitherhttp://nypost.com/2016/11/16/new-yorkers-wants-de-blasio-out-despite-uptick-in-approval-rating/
818599165089484800 2017-01-09 23:23:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samstecky is he a pretty unpopular mayor overall? like does the public hate him?
818598640679813120 2017-01-09 23:21:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @WileyNorvell it depends on the project! a lot of developers claim modular is cheaper if it can be shipped into the city efficiently
818597200683012096 2017-01-09 23:15:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MosesNYC @MarketUrbanism DCP sez these PLACES studies are ~not rezonings~
818591560598102017 2017-01-09 22:53:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism would like this
818591357560188928 2017-01-09 22:52:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also it seems like the problems with modular construction in NYC remain basically the same, 30 years after this article was written.
818590499602710529 2017-01-09 22:49:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is very interesting. Remember when the city subsidized single-fam home construction?pic.twitter.com/5pfAwhH1hc
818589986152775680 2017-01-09 22:47:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> TIL suburban-style Charlotte Gardens in South Bronx was one of the first modular housing developments in the cityhttp://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/04/realestate/factory-built-homes-widen-their-reach.html?pagewanted=all
818574834624057346 2017-01-09 21:47:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale it's a bad tweet, but he thread was basically about liberal NYC elites living in a bubble (obviously!)
818574344343392256 2017-01-09 21:45:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly i don't really care about this streep thing, but IMO Shafer threw much better shade in his politico column http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/hollywoods-victim-complex-214613

818559175211044868 2017-01-09 20:44:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amberdiscko @notbrynna student loans are only loans that don't go away when you die, assuming you have next of kin who can be forced to pay
818558785128189952 2017-01-09 20:43:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schadenfraade @TweetBenMax Not like we have a new subway line by his house or anything
818549205497221124 2017-01-09 20:05:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jmassengale One Vandy is similar - MTA contractors will do the subway work and SL Green is paying for it.
818548343676735491 2017-01-09 20:01:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jmassengale i suggest you read the DEIS on DCP's website, which explains in great detail how Midtown East transit improvements will work.
818535726207868930 2017-01-09 19:11:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly that entrance is priceless though

818528347940683777 2017-01-09 18:42:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jmassengale the rezoning isn't encouraging public-private partnerships. developers have to pay for improvements, not build them themselves
818519619610742785 2017-01-09 18:07:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Trump doesn't own 40 Wall St, his most valuable piece of NYC real estate. @KonradPutzier investigates who doeshttp://therealdeal.com/2017/01/06/meet-the-obscure-german-magnates-who-actually-own-trumps-most-valuable-building/

818480736906989568 2017-01-09 15:33:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> Hm, I wonder why he didn't do any of this before! Also wants to empower state DOL to enforce wage theft judgements https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-7th-proposal-2017-state-state-further-strengthening-new-yorks-efforts
818478717483806720 2017-01-09 15:25:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> Another proposal is "protecting NYers from cyber-attacks," which mostly involves imposing more severe penalties https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-4th-proposal-2017-state-state-protecting-new-yorkers-cyber-attacks
818476956836646912 2017-01-09 15:18:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas agree. though i wonder if he's going to give county BOEs the appropriate funding/tools to implement this

818245492324913154 2017-01-08 23:58:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb right but they're arguing it will weaken the market for existing buildings/make them less valuable...
818244290157694976 2017-01-08 23:53:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> Even the staunchest defenders of New York City parking have never used this bizarre logic
818241872992882688 2017-01-08 23:43:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder @MarketUrbanism does not seem like particularly solid logic
818241426660200448 2017-01-08 23:42:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is bad policy, and anyone who claims increasing parking requirements will preserve/create affordable housing is delusionalhttps://twitter.com/JakeAnbinder/status/818238347831283712

817818344124518400 2017-01-07 19:41:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jfagone oh its fascinating and this doesn't even get into in much detail. here's a great feature on him/his familyhttp://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/215672/what-will-become-of-jared-kushner
817817028392263681 2017-01-07 19:35:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ThorntonMcEnery funny to me to see 3 NYT politics writers covering a real estate deal the paper might not have even bothered with before
817815912338354181 2017-01-07 19:31:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ThorntonMcEnery it wasn't! i love crain's. just meant it would've been relegated to the real estate trades before.
817815715478732801 2017-01-07 19:30:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> None of this is new, but if it takes a Trump presidency with Kushner onboard for these issues to get more play in big papers, that's good
817815100837031936 2017-01-07 19:28:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> This story devotes two grafs to the EB-5 program, which shld really get a lot more attention as a backdoor citizenship program for the rich
817814577295589376 2017-01-07 19:26:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz oh i totally forgot about that! they rep a lot of big RE players. i doubt they're losing sleep over it
817814295463464960 2017-01-07 19:24:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> All this scrutiny on Trump & Kushner highlights how much of NYC real estate is kinda legalized corruption. The public should not be shocked
817813622864941056 2017-01-07 19:22:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> Not much new info here, but Kushner should've thought a little harder about this meeting w/ powerful Chinese investors right after election
817810969074274304 2017-01-07 19:11:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> A year ago, Anbang buying a stake in 666 Fifth Ave would've been an item in TRD or Crain's. Now it's an NYT feature!http://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/us/politics/jared-kushner-trump-business.html?referer=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FzaIFtPWy5G

817800191222960130 2017-01-07 18:28:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @guan many city press secretaries and PRs don't have twitter, which is mostly a good thing for me

817576556096851968 2017-01-06 03:40:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy there are agencies that post their FOIL requests online. I think Port Authority does, idk who else (don't think the MTA does)

817568536147197956 2017-01-06 03:08:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @heyguey if they redacted all the good parts I'm going to be very upset

817519783847620610 2017-01-06 23:54:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion @RWFreeman yep, and the expensive labor
817516928063442944 2017-01-06 23:43:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion @RWFreeman there are also costs associated with moving utilities, using eminent domain to seize property for stations
817516693765365760 2017-01-06 23:42:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion @RWFreeman MTA doesn't give contractors strong incentive to finish on time, so they exploit overtime/union rules to make more $$
817515846763499520 2017-01-06 23:39:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion @RWFreeman labor costs are part of it. so is MTA's poor project management and high cost of boring tunnels in NYC
817510657654398977 2017-01-06 23:18:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion @RWFreeman it's sad bc there are already tunnels dug in Harlem

817438218757046275 2017-01-06 18:30:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @WileyNorvell i think it's tied to perception that the BQX planning is being driven by developers who clearly stand to benefit
817435059678572545 2017-01-06 18:18:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka we should have coffee shop hangouts with @OlgaOksman
817432736726138880 2017-01-06 18:08:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @RKWinvisibleman yes and no, because part of the original subways involved rivalries btwn companies, existing rail/elevated lines
817432519364722688 2017-01-06 18:07:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas they're not making these comments in a vacuum
817431797072011265 2017-01-06 18:05:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i think these CBs are well aware that this process is being driven by developers and their tax revenues so that def plays into it

817409719014924288 2017-01-06 16:37:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alex_block yeah D.C. waterfront has been dead for decades; it's a totally different dynamic
817408662956371969 2017-01-06 16:33:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alex_block i think BBP model of "develop park and subsidize with property taxes" could be a valid one if you don't have neighbor opposition
817408435545395202 2017-01-06 16:32:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alex_block i mean it would have been fine if (1) BBP hadn't been so expensive and (2) neighborhood groups didn't hate development there
817408025917095938 2017-01-06 16:30:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @slowboring allocation of what? tax breaks? affordable housing? sounds like you're describing HPD, which already does this stuff
817407749499813888 2017-01-06 16:29:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alex_block we did that with Brooklyn Bridge Park but it's certainly a fraught and imperfect model
817407495954112512 2017-01-06 16:28:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alex_block so they're just talking about building fields they can lease to sports teams? and some of it would be landscaped waterfront?
817406546112036864 2017-01-06 16:24:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @slowboring then what is?

817131863907192833 2017-01-05 22:13:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy of course he could build more smaller units, but this one lot is relatively small

817087737589276672 2017-01-05 19:17:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik yes, that's what they did at Randolph. they linked 22 buildings
817085588864110593 2017-01-05 19:09:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik similar construction to what they're doing at Randolph Houses!

817067410301788161 2017-01-05 17:57:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik ok, towers in the park maybe somewhat less dense but ultimately more livable and easier to maintain than old law tenements
817066431326146561 2017-01-05 17:53:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz noah!! this is so nice, thank you
817066288824586241 2017-01-05 17:52:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik what's frustrating is that these were probably not renovated well when NYCHA acquired them, so who knows how long it had been
817066103134453760 2017-01-05 17:51:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schadenfraade @DanielKayHertz @jblumgart ....when the bar is basically "didn't allow all the buildings to decay and then demolish them"

817064235570266112 2017-01-05 17:44:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik yes, though I think towers in the park probably would have been more dense in this case
817058927967956992 2017-01-05 17:23:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schadenfraade @DanielKayHertz @jblumgart who knew we'd be holding up NYCHA as a success
817058611323170817 2017-01-05 17:22:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart they still have people covering Albany tho, so it seems only logical they should have one person in Trenton

817046973832372224 2017-01-05 16:35:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> While this is a success story for NYCHA, it's deeply unfortunate that long-term tenants suffered while the city/state dragged their feet
817045907057344513 2017-01-05 16:31:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> And she was too afraid to move to another NYCHA project because she's in her 70s and had never lived in a high rise before
817045673912700928 2017-01-05 16:30:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> For this story, I interviewed the head of the tenants' association, who said that there were RATS coming into her apartment before the reno

816853979397312512 2017-01-04 03:48:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schadenfraade @JakeAnbinder i was tempted but i refuse to pay what cabs usually charge to take you from JFK/Howard Beach to anywhere

816850700424593414 2017-01-04 03:35:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder @schadenfraade agree. AirTrain might not be perfect but i love flying into JFK bc I can take it to LIRR, be home in ~30 mins
816838735732084736 2017-01-04 02:48:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChappellTracker at least you worked for an agency that did pretty cool stuff. salt shed, hunters point library, etc!

816094011597475842 2017-01-02 01:29:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nycsouthpaw and since judiciary committee handles DOJ-related matters, makes sense to me
816091500513755136 2017-01-02 01:19:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nycsouthpaw no, but look at thishttps://twitter.com/BresPolitico/status/816077172888707072
816091067649036288 2017-01-02 01:17:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nycsouthpaw its deep red but if i had to take a wild guess it has to do with his chairmanship of the judicial committee
816079627621900289 2017-01-02 00:31:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexParkerDC aren't most people off? people don't get fired on holidays

815980810973179909 2017-01-02 17:59:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka i was on planes so i wasn't really paying attention
815980634531303424 2017-01-02 17:58:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet so the internet tells me, but that's not what her family does for whatever reason
815980344533012480 2017-01-02 17:57:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Russ_Steinberg apparently has something to do with the Civil War https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-eyed_pea#Lucky_New_Year_food
815979920681795584 2017-01-02 17:55:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> So my roommate tells me there's a southern superstition that if you don't eat blackeyed peas before the New Year, you'll get bad luck?

815967038170681348 2017-01-02 17:04:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> Pretty sure a large number of journalists have to do some of this for work anyway, but guess it's good to tell the public what it's like

815946711637995521 2017-01-02 15:43:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also the people next to me are talking about building editorial CMSes?
815945204599586816 2017-01-02 15:37:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull seems like everyone is getting breakfast right now, there's prob a line. but then again it's Tom's so there usually will be

815944367684861952 2017-01-02 15:34:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Russ_Steinberg i'm not either, i had a full week off for the first time in probably two years?

815773690268880901 2017-01-01 04:16:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller plus I always found flickr uploading and tagging rather tedious. Maybe the uploader is better now but idk
815773477051498497 2017-01-01 04:15:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller I have a flickr! I'm just lazy and I can only do so many things. And I stopped updating it when I started with IG
815772330307809280 2017-01-01 04:10:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Eradicator_NYC eh I used to
815763317935443968 2017-01-01 03:35:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale it's really true
815763069716627457 2017-01-01 03:34:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale IG started feeling too competitive and I just realized it was stressing me out for no reason! so i was like fuck it
815762054329954304 2017-01-01 03:30:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale I did that too but I wanted to make a new tumblr just for my pics and I don't use IG much anymore
815761176084774912 2017-01-01 03:26:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale ahaha that's not why but it's an added bonus

815755692409753600 2017-01-01 03:04:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> congrats!!!
815753622067757056 2017-01-01 02:56:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> IG makes me anxious, sorry, I know blogs are lame, etc. But it's nice to see big photos, and all together, rather than tiny square ones
815752212144066562 2017-01-01 02:50:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm getting a full-frame camera soon, so hopefully they will only get better!
815750879676657665 2017-01-01 02:45:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm kinda tired of instagram, so I started putting some of my work/personal photos up on Tumblr. https://darknyc.tumblr.com/
815727114997600256 2017-01-01 01:11:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad could it have been built as a separate track for freight when the tracks were reclaimed for passenger service?
815726964631801857 2017-01-01 01:10:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad that's interesting. you kind of allude to it in the post but i've never heard that. it's definitely newer than the rest

815669833887084544 2017-01-01 21:23:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EricLevitz @DavidKlion @nandelabra I also wouldn't conflate them with other Hasidic groups
815669647840346112 2017-01-01 21:22:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EricLevitz @DavidKlion @nandelabra meet some lubavitchers and then let's talk! I live in the Chabad HQ here and I think they'd disagree
815662964770504705 2017-01-01 20:56:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EricLevitz @DavidKlion @nandelabra what are you getting at? having chabad/Hasidic support is typical retail politics in NY and NJ

815613153807572993 2017-01-01 17:38:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brittneyplz the romper is open/unzipped and you're wearing tights?
815324481245892608 2016-12-31 22:31:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Honestly the use of the phrase "421a developers" in this headline is a little odd

814169516070424576 2016-12-28 18:01:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie but I think you're right that sometimes the maintenance/renovation costs can be prohibitive since so many houses need major work
814166227081949184 2016-12-28 17:48:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie it mostly means they have a lot more real estate than buyers; lots of foreclosures during recession
814165361817960448 2016-12-28 17:45:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie the average household income is close to $70K. but it's also a small city trying to reverse decades of economic depression

811435692421214208 2016-12-20 04:58:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @elivalley clearly he's been butchering hebrew for decades to get that hasidic bloc vote in south williamsburg
811434511233908736 2016-12-20 04:53:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime i'm convinced that central BK - crown/prospect heights, flatbush - are basically peak storefront church. also Harlem.

811428897132843008 2016-12-20 04:31:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm obsessed with storefront churches. I don't know why; I just love taking pictures of them and it's such a quintessentially big city thingpic.twitter.com/UrAS0Ftb3i
811425735172878336 2016-12-20 04:19:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj @SoBendito some nouns being neuter (bc they were neuter in Latin) does not mean you have non-binary pronouns

811420322922713089 2016-12-20 03:57:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @derektmead please tell me you put goggles over those
811354347984584710 2016-12-20 23:35:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca he refused and i had a very long, cold bike ride to the end of the 2/5 trains in flatbush
811354197451010050 2016-12-20 23:34:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca i once begged a bus driver near the rockaways (several miles from any subway stop) to let me take my bike on bus on a v cold day
811351761143336960 2016-12-20 23:25:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca maybe one day the MTA will let me bring my bike on the bus 
811351026838228992 2016-12-20 23:22:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca i grew up in D.C. and my experience is it snows less there than it does here in New York
811350708385677312 2016-12-20 23:20:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca i've almost slid off my bike a number of times trying to bike while there was still some snow here and it's not fun
811350456555438080 2016-12-20 23:19:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca that's impressive! my bike was stolen a month ago, but the only thing that really dissuades me is snow on the ground
811349899925159936 2016-12-20 23:17:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca yeah I think it comes down to tires, which I've never felt like investing in for NYC
811349734019530753 2016-12-20 23:17:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> If any other big companies would like to hire struggling artists to paint their offices/buildings/etc, I have plenty of suggestions!!
811349334386016256 2016-12-20 23:15:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca omg how do you bike in the ice/snow?? that's always been kind of a deal breaker for me, not the cold
811349172775481346 2016-12-20 23:14:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> TIL one of my fav graffiti writers painted some amazing walls for a huge management company's office at Hudson Yards http://klughaus.net/portfolio/bcg-hudson-yards-rime/

811343147674595328 2016-12-20 22:50:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @vanshnook i think even the olds appreciate arrival boards (possibly more than millennials do)
811342287645110272 2016-12-20 22:47:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @vanshnook like can't i go to Zaro's AND know when the 4 train is coming?
811342063216328706 2016-12-20 22:46:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @vanshnook seriously would it kill them to at least put an arrival board for the IRT trains in the passageway to fulton center?!
811341074518179840 2016-12-20 22:42:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @resnikoff imagine what they could do if their full-time news writers like that girl weren't forced to do like 10 posts a day
811336412566011904 2016-12-20 22:24:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnJCoyne thanks!
811334706151227392 2016-12-20 22:17:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm I avoided this fate by being so unfashionable that Buffalo Exchange never wanted to buy my clothes
811334228780711936 2016-12-20 22:15:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford yeah definitely! formal public review hasn't even started for this rezoning yet; there will be many more public meetings
811331628530302976 2016-12-20 22:05:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford and a lot of folks think that the confluence of shelters/social services/rehabs around 125th is what caused the shanty town
811331243715465216 2016-12-20 22:03:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford but yes, it is shameful... a lot of people would argue East Harlem is already over-burdened with shelters though
811330945953447937 2016-12-20 22:02:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford and NYCHA and HUD are deeply concerned about their funding under Trump... there's a lot of uncertainty, unfortunately
811330746581401600 2016-12-20 22:01:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford i don't know! that'd be interesting. i can tell you Cuomo is holding a lot of low-income/supportive housing funding hostage
811330190966226944 2016-12-20 21:59:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford but supportive housing for the homeless could be constructed on publicly owned sites that they've earmarked as 100% affordable
811329676773851137 2016-12-20 21:57:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford it's harder for the city to commit to supportive/homeless hsg when they don't know whether state & feds will fund it
811329477569552385 2016-12-20 21:56:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @MarketUrbanism didn't these guys even go before the BSA? I forget exactly but I think the parking was involved
811328874911039490 2016-12-20 21:54:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford you can also submit written testimony to DCP on the draft scope of work thru Jan 4 http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/applicants/scoping-documents.page
811328675241226240 2016-12-20 21:53:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford if you feel passionately, you should go to the community board or borough board meetings they hold as part of ULURP & testify
811327762250211328 2016-12-20 21:49:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford the commitments for the zoning aren't finalized. if you want to read the city's plan, that's here http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/applicants/env-review/east-harlem/draft-scope-of-work.pdf
811326365714747392 2016-12-20 21:44:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford abby's write-up was more thorough & she doesn't mention it either http://citylimits.org/2016/12/16/visions-clash-at-meeting-on-environmental-review-for-east-harlem-rezoning/. you can also watch their video of it
811326136496033792 2016-12-20 21:43:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford unfortunately i don't recall any real testimony or discussion about shelter sites.
811317820202090497 2016-12-20 21:10:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford yes, that's what the city says the meetings are for
811252321103577088 2016-12-20 16:50:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy is that surprising?
811252227323154448 2016-12-20 16:49:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism has to be certified first. i don't believe we've entered formal ULURP yet
811251239979806720 2016-12-20 16:45:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i've never seen them by the YMCA. i'm talking about nostrand and st johns. they are here very regularly
811250846184906752 2016-12-20 16:44:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @filmsbyAmy i agree! this one is quite dramatic; i was expecting resistance
811241869577428994 2016-12-20 16:08:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @S_Evangelina glad this tweet inspired me to look for coquito-related contenthttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/11/nyregion/in-search-of-a-coquito-like-abuela-used-to-make.html
811241044213989377 2016-12-20 16:05:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pauldebenedetto congrats! i bet Dave is jealous
811236563816513536 2016-12-20 15:47:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jblumgart for a sec i was totally baffled by this bc i was like "i think NYC rents have gone up like 70% in the last 15 years"

811231680036016128 2016-12-20 15:27:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn yeah, they're usually out during rush hour, esp in the mornings. definitely revenue raising
811226919249264640 2016-12-20 15:09:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> Does the MTA really need six transit cops at my local SBS stop right now? Or ever?
811219577661177856 2016-12-20 14:39:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @4rilla yeah I heard :(

811071788969062400 2016-12-19 04:52:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AYReport @erinmdurkin @Azi @jimepstein @TMannWSJ @chayesmatthew are you asking about public housing? like NYCHA?

811067358081089536 2016-12-19 04:35:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes lol i'm not judging anyone; i'm just glad i didn't have to read about it
811066915145781248 2016-12-19 04:33:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helenbholmes the sugar daddy sites didn't really exist when i was an undergrad and i am so grateful
811061564518309888 2016-12-19 04:12:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AYReport @jimepstein @chayesmatthew @erinmdurkin its pretty much in line with market rate rents for new construction buildings nearby
811059278165528576 2016-12-19 04:02:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AYReport @erinmdurkin @chayesmatthew @jimepstein i guess! depends on the project and the tax break. IBO quantifies them sometimes
811058315195248641 2016-12-19 03:59:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AYReport @erinmdurkin @jimepstein @chayesmatthew and here in NYC, it's not too hard to figure out what tax breaks they're getting
811057916463771648 2016-12-19 03:57:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AYReport @erinmdurkin @jimepstein @chayesmatthew erin is right, they are not always subsidized. & "below market-rate" is decent alternative
811057498379681792 2016-12-19 03:55:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Ballaban but in general, owners of abandoned properties love to circulate rumors about how their security is way more serious than it is
811057135618588672 2016-12-19 03:54:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Ballaban i've heard it's p cool but they're not joking about the security

810555394242252800 2016-12-18 18:40:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @donewman @MarketUrbanism particularly in bronx, it's not uncommon. also you can settle non-payment case & start a holdover one
810352368101507072 2016-12-17 05:13:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito cmon, this isn't SF
810332216291164160 2016-12-17 03:53:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> I see @MarketUrbanism's many tweets persuaded @HenryGrabarhttps://twitter.com/slate/status/810293130247409664
810277233894064128 2016-12-17 00:15:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @raiawrites yes, i'm familiar with what they did at 777 St Marks in CH. often they are kicking out tenants who were behind on rent
810276519583084544 2016-12-17 00:12:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @raiawrites has it sold to a new owner in the last 3 years? quite typical in central BK for new owners to buy big bldgs and evict tenants
810274650815086592 2016-12-17 00:05:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @raiawrites but majority of eviction cases in NYC are about non-payment of rent
810274494057238529 2016-12-17 00:04:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @raiawrites you would have to know the names on the individual cases in order to look them up and find out the grounds
810274404475240448 2016-12-17 00:04:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @raiawrites they're aggregating data on thousands of cases. it says they got the numbers from the public advocates office (likely via FOIL)
810270722417455104 2016-12-17 23:49:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> Hundreds of evictions filed in Brooklyn's Starrett City, which is also being sued for turning away homeless tenants https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150902/starrett-city/spring-creek-towers-sued-for-barring-tenants-on-de-blasios-rent-programpic.twitter.com/4uYw7Pqzds

810267364340154368 2016-12-17 23:36:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> A lot of evictions going on in the last three years in Flatbush. Great map of evictions from ProPublica  https://projects.propublica.org/evictions/#13.53/40.6469/-73.9624pic.twitter.com/4ESAp2Y0Zb

810263193763348480 2016-12-17 23:19:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @MarketUrbanism yes. different hasidic groups, etc
810257684624773120 2016-12-17 22:57:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz as Hasidic neighborhoods go, Boro Park doesn't feel quite as insular as South Williamsburg, in my experience

809969467753136128 2016-12-16 03:52:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull there is literally a reporter at the Times whose beat for years has been writing about wild animals that wander into the city

809905100277841920 2016-12-16 23:36:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AudacityofPope @Jill_Jorgensen definitely. i know a lot of people who lived on Grand/Classon and called it PH

809836481757978625 2016-12-16 19:03:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pblest @DavidKlion @amandamull and i wonder what would be required, at the party level, for DNC/DSCC to change their thinking on this
809836026881523712 2016-12-16 19:02:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pblest @DavidKlion @amandamull it's an issue of resources and many of the southern races/elections cost more to win than Dems want to spend
809835300621058050 2016-12-16 18:59:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull @pblest @DavidKlion @RWFreeman yeah this is not why they're winnable. immigrants yes, black folks yes, not northerners
809835043854176256 2016-12-16 18:58:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pblest @DavidKlion @amandamull since the party's unwillingness to go hard in competitive deep south House/Sen races cost them seats
809834872177037312 2016-12-16 18:57:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pblest @DavidKlion @amandamull i think southern Dems need to make a compelling case to their leadership that they're worth spending $$ on
809833556222611461 2016-12-16 18:52:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion @amandamull @pblest i'm interested in LA. why do you think so there?
809833232065843201 2016-12-16 18:51:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull @DavidKlion i plead guilty too but i've spent time. in any case, i haven't seen much evidence that, say, LA, MS, AL would go Dem
809830396170997760 2016-12-16 18:39:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion @amandamull i think that hill is a much steeper climb in the deep south
809830269662429184 2016-12-16 18:39:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidKlion @amandamull besides the carolinas, what other states do you think are as winnable as GA?

809819696916819968 2016-12-16 17:57:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SteveInBrooklyn if it's a vacant site that all depends on the buyer and when they start construction

809816950163603460 2016-12-16 17:46:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday i just saw an ad on the 4 train about the rebranding and felt a little sad
809816339401637888 2016-12-16 17:43:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mekosoff in any case, the state is transporting the deer somewhere and it may not survive the trip, so i guess it doesn't matter
809816235751907328 2016-12-16 17:43:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mekosoff sure, but SI's urban areas along North Shore are not particularly well-suited. NYC actually decided to sterilize hundreds of deer
809815717709287424 2016-12-16 17:41:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mekosoff the irony of this is that SI is full of a deer and it never commanded this level of drama

809813162224652288 2016-12-16 17:31:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mekosoff and why, particularly?
809813085884190720 2016-12-16 17:30:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand @mekosoff my favorite is: "we pitched this to WSJ and NYT and they passed so..."
809812350211674116 2016-12-16 17:28:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mekosoff it will likely die anyway but supposedly they're going to save it
809811556959653888 2016-12-16 17:24:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon and ESU is supposed to be some of the most highly trained units in the NYPD...
809809373191086085 2016-12-16 17:16:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> And now the city wants to deploy an undercover cop from ESU to kill the deer... for reasons I don't understandhttp://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/city-plans-euthanize-deer-found-home-nycha-lawn-article-1.2913134?cid=bitly
809808849213542403 2016-12-16 17:14:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin why is this so dramatic? ESU, really?

809779412191285248 2016-12-16 15:17:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> The mayor is still mad about how the state killed his millionaire tax to fund universal pre-K, says we should be talking about that
809778591089262592 2016-12-16 15:13:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GloriaPazmino it was a very lengthy non-answer
809778221193564160 2016-12-16 15:12:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> He says we should have publicly financed campaigns
809778058366480384 2016-12-16 15:11:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> The mayor isn't really answering this question, except to say he "disclosed everything" and did "everything by the law" to win UPK & aff hsg
809777420148555776 2016-12-16 15:09:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kn8 the park next door is an AIDS memorial. the building is just a ventilation building

809619396658417664 2016-12-15 04:41:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Josmar_Trujillo fun from a reporter's perspective, since we like controversy. incongruous is i guess a better word
809568233879703553 2016-12-15 01:18:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> At the East Harlem hearing, fun to hear comments from Latino activists in Spanish with the word "REBNY" dropped in there

809507130806063104 2016-12-15 21:15:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat @SoBendito yeah that's what i thought of too, which is not really a "developer accountability program"
809506764177764352 2016-12-15 21:13:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat yeah this could mean a million different things. i haven't heard about any programs - proposed or current- described that way
809506357816782850 2016-12-15 21:12:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat what kind of developer accountability program? was this just some comment that the mayor made?
809506028954013700 2016-12-15 21:10:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is an unacceptably low salary range for a full time editor job at a reputable publication in D.C.pic.twitter.com/RGtxGym6e1

809489770032271361 2016-12-15 20:06:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @rafaelsolari @albrgr StreetEasy does release quarterly reports on rents
809475857123332098 2016-12-15 19:10:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL but it does seem crazy to hold freelancers to the same standards as staff re: social media conduct. where do you draw that line?
809475578659278848 2016-12-15 19:09:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL not specifically, but i wouldn't be surprised if it was in there. in any case, unfortunate it'll now affect their whole staff
809474700753731585 2016-12-15 19:06:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL right, but maybe it was written into her contract?
809474041337806848 2016-12-15 19:03:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL the fact that tweet was beyond the pale is a separate issue from whether it angered the admin. makes it easier to justify firing
809469612274257920 2016-12-15 18:46:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL dangerous because it limits what journalists can say on social media?

809448871239761922 2016-12-15 17:23:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'd love to hear what people who cover NJ, like @spsullivan and @carla_astudi, think of this series
809448511775375360 2016-12-15 17:22:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter i forgot about it and i'm a little sad :-/
809447264724914176 2016-12-15 17:17:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> In Part 1, they call the mayor of East Rutherford, NJ "a tire salesman in a Brooks Brothers suit"

809242419858460674 2016-12-14 03:43:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dream_king probably. i think conservative states have plenty of high school bands
809240483746762757 2016-12-14 03:35:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> Apparently none from the surrounding MD and VA counties have either.
809240105970003968 2016-12-14 03:34:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> None of D.C.'s celebrated, black HS & college marching bands have applied to march in the Trump inaugurationhttp://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/DC-Area-Marching-Bands-Opt-to-Sit-Out-Trumps-Inaugural-Parade-406387625.html

809180955449688065 2016-12-14 23:39:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj nothing more New York than a $4 billion white marble train station/mall conceived as a monument to victims of a terrorist attack
809179396494032896 2016-12-14 23:32:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn idk!
809179028519321607 2016-12-14 23:31:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj I recommend it. The architecture is incredible but the mall and crowds are at odds with it

809168796791570434 2016-12-14 22:50:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> The whole complex feels a little less weird and corporate now that the food is open at least

809165188188536833 2016-12-14 22:36:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas I like that you can see the colored lights from the street too

809124923448950786 2016-12-14 19:56:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> In case you've forgotten that everything is about gentrification
809124676538662912 2016-12-14 19:55:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism well he did refer to application for resi in industrial zones...

809111653417713664 2016-12-14 19:03:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism it was on woodside avenue he said
809111597599903744 2016-12-14 19:03:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism no he didn't say
809111559817535488 2016-12-14 19:03:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism also i guess there have been issues recently where CMs did not get copies of BSA applications
809111264190496768 2016-12-14 19:02:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism there was a MAS report two years ago. Van Bramer said there was an out-of-scale project in Woodside recently that he opposed
809110941900111872 2016-12-14 19:00:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Cyphran its our public land use process for a major zoning change
809110622977851392 2016-12-14 18:59:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BenKallos @MarketUrbanism he means the full applications like we see on DCP website. plus the resolutions with testimony after hearings
809110140452478976 2016-12-14 18:57:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Ahaha you can file a FOIL request if you want to look at a BSA resolution but they won't post it online
809109953617231873 2016-12-14 18:57:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> But if it goes thru full ULURP, it gets posted on DCP's website anyway
809109878203617280 2016-12-14 18:56:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> Basically the exec director of the BSA is really strongly opposed to posting variance applications online, "for security reasons"
809109545217904640 2016-12-14 18:55:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> Kallos: We're...living in the 21st century, and it's hard to go to the community board office between 9 and 5 pm to view a BSA application
809107378566205442 2016-12-14 18:46:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bradlander @NYCCouncil @danielleiat @ReporterLeslie @SallyGold and they didn't want to pay $2.2MM into fund in order to do 11 units, right?

808695564095418368 2016-12-13 15:30:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism paywalled
808686134238859264 2016-12-13 14:52:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alanalevinson i agree with you but i feel like there are also a decent number of prominent women on twitter who do numbered tweet threads
808525420954079232 2016-12-12 04:14:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz just reading this and i can't handle it http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bana-alabed-twitters-child-witness-to-the-battle-for-aleppo?intcid=mod-latest

808511912275312640 2016-12-12 03:20:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka it's like $1000/sf compared to $790/sf for the other ones. crazy
808511731429470208 2016-12-12 03:19:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka also that one bedroom 1.5 bath apartment is a terrible deal compared to the other ones. only upside is bigger balcony

808499640110878721 2016-12-12 02:31:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> City agencies should probably get their shit together on this
808498507569123328 2016-12-12 02:27:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> The piece makes it sound like they are effectively abandoning the new zoning - which isn't what DCP has said to me in the past
808497867920932864 2016-12-12 02:24:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin lol so basically he didn't address it, just categorically denied
808496864647581696 2016-12-12 02:20:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> That they are fast tracking the special permits for hotels is no surprise, but no answers in whether they'll upzone North BK industrial area
808496272885895169 2016-12-12 02:18:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> This @jdavidgoodman sadly doesn't answer what I've been trying to figure out - will BdB change industrial zoning? http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/nyregion/unlikely-ally-and-quiet-shift-in-de-blasio-plan-to-protect-industrial-jobs.html?mtrref=t.co
808495755480670209 2016-12-12 02:16:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin right. Did he offer much context beyond this? I saw your other tweet but sounds like he didn't really explain himself

808375031868833792 2016-12-12 18:16:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @benhjacobs yeah it's six properties, and i think more than 6 buildings - probably 8 or 9 tenements

808374522915278848 2016-12-12 18:14:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas aha ok, valid. but the ventilation building is ugly!
808374214361280512 2016-12-12 18:13:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm sure the seniors will love the SAS ventilation building and the constant sound of the Q train rumbling beneath their feet
808374031934226432 2016-12-12 18:12:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> I also wonder how it's going to be constructing a 24-story building on top of a new, probably still sort-of-under construction subway line

807683660912660481 2016-12-10 20:29:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @woolie i can guess what you're thinking, but give us the broad strokes?
807683486631006208 2016-12-10 20:28:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Yes, let's blame the Ghost Ship fire on Oakland's housing crisis without acknowledging what we need to do to fix it https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/12/oakland-ghost-ship-artists-warehouse-fire/
807682534695927812 2016-12-10 20:24:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz "housing guarantee"

807665367837474816 2016-12-10 19:16:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whoawen woah! any idea what that building was before? warehouse? school?
807665085506326528 2016-12-10 19:15:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism still too much for this part of bed stuy
807664406851190785 2016-12-10 19:12:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik now that 4 bed is a sweet deal

807317254945853445 2016-12-09 20:13:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> After four years of j school and four years of full time reporting, I can finally stand to transcribe my own voice from recorded interviews
807315723609669632 2016-12-09 20:07:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin yea definitely!

807315474702856192 2016-12-09 20:06:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin we also have this thing called a one-shot deal, which is not no-strings attached, but it's basically an emergency cash grant
807313794452037632 2016-12-09 19:59:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin like here in NYC you can use EBT at CSAs and farmer's markets, which is quite unusual compared to other places
807313221824745473 2016-12-09 19:57:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin yeah. whenever states talk about expanding what you can buy with food stamps, that's the counter argument
807312574920396800 2016-12-09 19:54:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesFDennin conservatives make the same arguments about food stamps

807291178693652480 2016-12-09 18:29:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie SF is more sensitive than we are. Still common in most renderings I see for NYC projects
807290962955436032 2016-12-09 18:28:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> The space will "remain residential and retail-focused" is about as vague as it gets when it comes to plans for a property
807290612668055552 2016-12-09 18:27:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm not sure if I've seen it in other sources, but TRD reported Eli Hamway was the buyer http://therealdeal.com/2016/12/06/eli-hamway-buys-famed-cobble-hill-home-of-bookcourt/
807290009913098241 2016-12-09 18:25:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> The developer who bought BookCourt is the same guy who evicted hundreds of Gowanus artists for office space http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/10/new-looks-and-leasing-launch-for-gowanus-warehouse-to-office-conversion-that-evicted-artists.html
807289473943957505 2016-12-09 18:23:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ the balconies go above the top of the roof line... it's an odd rendering. i assume they won't actually have those.
807287889826549761 2016-12-09 18:16:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ the step out balconies on the roof deck are pointless and i'm not sure why they're on there. what else do you mean?
807282277738811392 2016-12-09 17:54:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay omg it happens in SF too?

807240607773159424 2016-12-09 15:08:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik that being said, it's pretty easy to buy scalie images if you want to include POCs, and a lot of firms do
807239629938327552 2016-12-09 15:05:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik maybe Chinese Sketchup or Autocad comes with it! the ones sold in the US don't.
807238963509493761 2016-12-09 15:02:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader good luck!
807238392119443456 2016-12-09 15:00:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Rendering software does not come with scalie POC, so architects either have to buy stock photos or pull pics of POC off Google images

806916766731538436 2016-12-08 17:42:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is probably a good time to mention NYC's loft law is byzantine and unnecessarily strict, should be updated to actually help tenants
806916154832863232 2016-12-08 17:39:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism true
806915529617403904 2016-12-08 17:37:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism the problem is they lack a legalizing mechanism. and if the oakland govt had been more effective, they would've been evicted
806915245721718785 2016-12-08 17:36:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i disagree, since you can fire-proof a converted warehouse just like you can fireproof a resi building (or not)
806914101347778560 2016-12-08 17:31:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes, you have to establish that someone lived there then, but it doesn't have to have been you
806913808061100032 2016-12-08 17:30:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism we're not talking about "why did they live there" but "what were the forces that led to their deaths." different questions
806913743162671104 2016-12-08 17:30:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism what are you talking about? loft law applications re-opened last year https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150708/williamsburg/loft-tenants-get-another-shot-at-legalizing-their-homes
806913147370176513 2016-12-08 17:27:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism right, but as story goes on to note, the illegal industrial buildings can be more effectively fire-proofed than that one was
806912818717007872 2016-12-08 17:26:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i mean clearly there is also a policy issue if they don't have an equivalent to loft law
806912234085556225 2016-12-08 17:24:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik however, illegal basement conversions/illegal conversions with too many units in general still a big problem in poor hoods
806912142985326594 2016-12-08 17:23:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik tbh i think it's much harder to live in an illegal artist loft in a gentrified hood now.

806907604928581632 2016-12-08 17:05:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i guess most of that was early 2000s (beginning in 2000) http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/nyregion/14water.html
806907498976387072 2016-12-08 17:05:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik 247 Water Street in Dumbo is famous one. vacated, tenants returned, LL messed with the building, and then *mysterious fire*
806906548022689792 2016-12-08 17:01:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik this is still the case!
806906479819177985 2016-12-08 17:01:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith agree, definitely. people have been living in illegal spaces in NYC since the city existed, and it first came to a head in the 70s
806905869854244864 2016-12-08 16:58:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik at least! if not earlier. there was a lot of that happening in Dumbo too, in the 90s
806905626123063296 2016-12-08 16:57:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> I guess we were also lucky to have a wave of activist artists who fought to legalize their then-cheap spaces in Chelsea, Soho, etc
806905390965420032 2016-12-08 16:56:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ sure. seems strange that city doesn't have a process in place to legalize illegally converted spaces while protecting tenants
806905151076192258 2016-12-08 16:55:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> Why are other cities just grappling with stuff that NYC had to deal with 20-30 years ago? Is it because we have a crazy building code?
806904994314223616 2016-12-08 16:55:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tdfischer_ that's crazy! but people can convert industrial buildings to live-work spaces? or is that not a feasible process?

806902392583286785 2016-12-08 16:44:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> Doesn't Oakland have an equivalent of NYC's loft law? If so, the city needs to educate tenants on it http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/12/07/evictions-in-ghost-ships-wake-artists-worst-fears-coming-true/

806711924218101761 2016-12-07 04:08:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm not convinced they won't still try to troll the city into some kind of better deal for a rezoning, but they are going thru the motions
806711741652627456 2016-12-07 04:07:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> Units will probably be mostly condos or upscale rentals. No affordable housing, school, etc required

806708003227496448 2016-12-07 03:52:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz this one is worse. it reminds me of florida for some reason https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9801587,-87.8403306,3a,60y,180.64h,87.62t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxkN_3AWyzYXro6Bn6wKb5A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1

806255330002927616 2016-12-06 21:53:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak the non-profit ones are fascinating. i think a lot of orgs in NYC would jump on this, even with the optics https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/social-impact

805885898252517376 2016-12-05 21:25:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik could be! or for height reasons, or both. i'm too lazy to check the zoning rn
805885428477923328 2016-12-05 21:23:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik they're ~townhouse condos~ http://www.rgtect.net/east_29th.htm
805884968710836225 2016-12-05 21:22:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik the gray home depot backsplash strikes again
805879271952678913 2016-12-05 20:59:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad in fairness, NYCHA rarely if ever sells property that already has housing on it
805877797369638912 2016-12-05 20:53:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Or: we thought we had the money to demolish and rebuild but then it turns out we didn't! Oops!
805877639655329792 2016-12-05 20:52:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SteveInBrooklyn it's happened a couple times
805877043552468992 2016-12-05 20:50:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Because "we got federal funding for it" sounds like a shitty answer, I'm guessing
805876908097409029 2016-12-05 20:50:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> So it turns out city agencies don't like talking about why they pushed thousands of residents out of public housing without a plan
805876489757589504 2016-12-05 20:48:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder i guess we'd have to see the full speech if a transcript or video exists (idk where this is from)
805874922748837888 2016-12-05 20:42:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rmc031 @DanielKayHertz seems like he admits to receiving food stamps and that's about it
805872990319759360 2016-12-05 20:34:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rmc031 @DanielKayHertz well it's not in his autobiographyhttps://twitter.com/JakeAnbinder/status/805870663001055232
805872227505868800 2016-12-05 20:31:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rmc031 @DanielKayHertz also it's not clear to me that he actually did live in public housing
805871851268411392 2016-12-05 20:29:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder i feel like if it were true it would be in his autobiography
805862809921785856 2016-12-05 19:54:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samarkhurshid well the story says that some people used bows and arrows last time, lol
805849229558185985 2016-12-05 19:00:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vgmac @TimJHanrahan @ryanbeckwith and isn't there a bus?
805844720740167680 2016-12-05 18:42:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty they just opened so I'm cutting them some slack. But I think it's a growing trend in NYC
805841609879326720 2016-12-05 18:29:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> This place is very cute. Only downside is they don't have wifihttps://twitter.com/rachelholliday/status/805797755922825216
805821352406040578 2016-12-05 17:09:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @margareteby i would definitely burn half of whatever was in there by forgetting about it
805804990178721792 2016-12-05 16:04:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz you are much more efficient than me
805797024251674624 2016-12-05 15:32:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz did you already finish Invention of Brownstone BK?
805788282172874757 2016-12-05 14:57:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> Turns out Steve agrees with @2AvSagashttps://twitter.com/stevecuozzo/status/805783139578761220
805782472550215680 2016-12-05 14:34:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly @shaneferro also "such brothels purportedly now outnumber Starbucks in New York." according to who??!!
805782321458712576 2016-12-05 14:34:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly @shaneferro yeah it's horrifying and they did it in the insensitive way they're known for
805615978834984960 2016-12-04 03:33:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @miller_stephen @MarketUrbanism didn't you write about some mansion in gravesend that was shaped like a coffin or something?
805615231586209793 2016-12-04 03:30:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @miller_stephen i mean @MarketUrbanism is obsessed with tacky rich people mansions in south brooklyn and i am a little bit too
805614870951591937 2016-12-04 03:28:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @miller_stephen "it's ugly but i didn't break any laws so..."
805614608836861952 2016-12-04 03:27:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @miller_stephen also i like how architect defends the design by saying it complies with zoning regulations. like that makes it less terrible
805614123933401088 2016-12-04 03:25:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @miller_stephen this is pretty offensive for like a 10 million dollar mansion
805613888423264256 2016-12-04 03:24:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty i'm excited that REI moved into the old washington coliseum though! that was really sad and derelict for decades
805611462387519489 2016-12-04 03:15:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kittertwitty shoulda been swampoodle
805551859972919299 2016-12-04 23:18:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JamesSLanning have fun!! where ya going? berlin?
805551033317490695 2016-12-04 23:15:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sydbrownstone right. i guess it would also depend on the cost of delays/whether alternate routes would be substantially more expensive
805550130086690816 2016-12-04 23:11:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sydbrownstone if the EIS is looking for an alternate route, would Trump really have strong incentive to stop it as long as it gets built?
805548754757701633 2016-12-04 23:06:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nwmalinowski is there a specific protest or you're just talking about the blockades etc?

804374120934862848 2016-12-01 17:18:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @audevwhite depressing
804373414941179908 2016-12-01 17:15:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @audevwhite so you mean he is paying people to take model-style shots of him? or he's posting pics he clearly didn't take?
804372461248778240 2016-12-01 17:11:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> But I guess most people I met from IG were trying to market themselves as photographers rather than as complete personal brands (ugh)
804371267998666752 2016-12-01 17:07:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> It costs way less to just become a halfway decent photographer than to pay someone $2,000/month to take pics for you https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-11-30/confessions-of-an-instagram-influencer

804088679857868800 2016-11-30 22:24:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sdevlin7 i think their feeling is the similarities are the white working class base, being law and order oriented, and antipathy to press
804088505383219202 2016-11-30 22:23:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sdevlin7 sure. i'd like to hear your reaction to the podcast, some great clips of Rizzo fighting with reporters.

804061543713349632 2016-11-30 20:36:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexCKaufman you're referencing Peretti's comments about unions being "rigid"?

803984533746020352 2016-11-30 15:30:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik this is your street? and idk something odd with the caching? can you refresh?
803983429444452352 2016-11-30 15:26:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple this is just bad freelancing
803982693889437696 2016-11-30 15:23:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner that first thing. if everyone was willing to do that, no one would get paid for writing/reporting ever
803982563287203840 2016-11-30 15:22:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> Of all the takes on Rory being a bad journalist, I thought NY Mag's was pretty good http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/rory-gilmore-is-still-a-terrible-journalist.html
803981655409127424 2016-11-30 15:18:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm halfway through the new Gilmore Girls and sad that Rory is a supposedly established journalist willing to do reporting for GQ "on spec"
803979944003047425 2016-11-30 15:12:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @annamerlan @danielleiat and then there's the classic "what are you going to be when you grow up?"

803464866841395201 2016-11-28 05:05:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism and i think if you live near poverty line, unlikely your friends and fam in NYC probably can house a homeless family w/ kids

803463952525103104 2016-11-28 05:01:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism the headline aside, it's worth noting that people who are v behind on their rent often have outstanding housing court cases

803344946661093376 2016-11-28 21:08:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik yea it's connected to other buildings... the law is so dumb and has too many caveats
803344397140115456 2016-11-28 21:06:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik since loft law has to comply with multiple dwelling law, which only applies to buildings with 3 or more units
803344267225735169 2016-11-28 21:06:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik maybe counting it as a multi-building thing made it legal... i have a friend who can't legalize his loft bc he's the only unit
803344084739952640 2016-11-28 21:05:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik complex... like connected buildings? or just next to each other?
803343187037356032 2016-11-28 21:01:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik did it have at least three units?
803343072348078080 2016-11-28 21:01:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i guess that means they blend in pretty well?

803332088325869568 2016-11-28 20:17:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's cool that they want to do floating buildings in flood-prone Bangladesh, but sad they don't have the $$ to build actual homes there

803301234564333569 2016-11-28 18:15:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @miller_stephen @woolie can't tear it down, can't afford to fix it, it's a mess
803300720598515712 2016-11-28 18:13:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> And because Cuomo wanted to be remembered for raising the minimum wage, and for suddenly being union-friendly
803300435964657664 2016-11-28 18:12:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> An organizer on Fight for 15 campaign told me recently the main reason they won in NY is bc the construction trades joined their protests
803300003875852288 2016-11-28 18:10:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> In terms of numbers of protesters, this is a big win for SEIU, which is funding the Fight for $15 campaignhttps://twitter.com/JackSmithIV/status/803299326416093189

803024706668548096 2016-11-27 23:56:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz there are a couple books on it (i.e. https://www.amazon.com/Strike-That-Changed-York-Hill-Brownsville/dp/0300109407) but this nation piece is goodhttps://www.thenation.com/article/tough-lessons-1968-teacher-strikes/
803023833930158080 2016-11-27 23:52:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz read up on the ocean hill-brownsville teachers strike if you have not
803023511350558721 2016-11-27 23:51:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz but i would wonder also what this book considers Bed-Stuy, which is a matter of some debate
803023307876564992 2016-11-27 23:50:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz central and eastern BK didn't really turn the corner to majority black till the 60s
803022917890166784 2016-11-27 23:49:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz what do you mean
803022529963196421 2016-11-27 23:47:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i will never have time to read all the Important Urbanism Books
803020634204864512 2016-11-27 23:40:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie honestly the least believable part of their apartment is the separate kitchen that's decently sized
803018822676598784 2016-11-27 23:33:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie it was but even so, it's 1BR with separate, spacious living and kitchen. that's at least $2500, $3000 in that hood
803018490236076032 2016-11-27 23:31:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm i hear people live in neighborhoods not off the L train but i never see it on TV so idk
803017809521414144 2016-11-27 23:28:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie like obviously they live in wburg or greenpoint, have fairly large apartments... where's that $$ coming from
803017536472125443 2016-11-27 23:27:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie true! but if we talked about financial stability, we'd have to acknowledge that none of them could afford that hood
803016184429940736 2016-11-27 23:22:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> Guess I wasn't really sold on the satire of it http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/search-party-is-one-of-the-best-shows-of-2016.html
803015326988378112 2016-11-27 23:19:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie yeah i just finished it. i did think about the financial thing but not acknowledging it is a common NYC TV trope
803013876547813378 2016-11-27 23:13:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie obviously the friends are parodies, and the red hook cult boutique is funny, but i expected more self awareness
803013668338339840 2016-11-27 23:12:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie i thought if it were really skewering those people, i figured it would be better at using the fairly obvious comedy
803012668391034880 2016-11-27 23:08:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie is it? some of it is, but it takes itself pretty seriously a lot of the time
802966942659264512 2016-11-27 20:06:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @4rilla love to watch shows about boutiques masquerading as cults
802966830973419520 2016-11-27 20:06:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> At least it uses its extreme Brooklyn-ness to further the plot and occasionally for comedic effect

801087317280784384 2016-11-22 15:37:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @cwarzel EXACTLY
801086964506116096 2016-11-22 15:36:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> Were other publications approached or considered for this? What were the terms involved? Maybe Kushner just chose Forbes?
801086531213504512 2016-11-22 15:34:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> Kushner's first on record intvw after election isn't w/ mainstream politics reporter, but w/ Forbes reporter who usually profiles tech CEOs

801068511258931201 2016-11-22 14:23:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes that remains to be seen. he's not in office yet and his advisors have a few months to wear him down
801068041396224000 2016-11-22 14:21:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes unfortunately a lot of this kind of stuff in D.C. relies on access... idea that legacy media won't have it is crazy/fascinating
801067607109472256 2016-11-22 14:19:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> What does White House pool reporting look like in an administration that allows basically no access?
801066374743232512 2016-11-22 14:14:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz i think this highlights captive quality of WH pool reporting. assumes access and can instill fear of challenging status quo
801065446807961600 2016-11-22 14:11:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz tho white house reporting essentially involves giving the white house the benefit of the doubt, even if not the prez himself

799635270354276352 2016-11-18 15:27:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> Mayor & NYPD are going to give an update on Trump Tower security/potentially shutting down part of Fifth Ave over there later today, BdB sez
799634784490291200 2016-11-18 15:26:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> He also notes that if Trump is on-board for major infrastructure spending, maybe he could be on-board for affordable housing funding (hmmm)
799634225188245504 2016-11-18 15:23:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> BdB says even Republican senators who rep big cities may fight cuts to federal affordable housing funding
799633803979423744 2016-11-18 15:22:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> BdB says they'll keep trying to offer rental subsidies to people who need them, mentions free lawyers for low-income folks in eviction cases
799633591303016448 2016-11-18 15:21:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@BrianLehrer asks what's gonna happen when Trump cuts fed funding for affordable housing.
799632951189217280 2016-11-18 15:18:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> "We need the trades to work with us and find the balance, but I'd always prefer it to be union labor [building affordable housing]" - BdB
799632660175998976 2016-11-18 15:17:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> When @BrianLehrer asks about 421-a deal and union requirements, mayor responds that "we're still assessing that plan [announced last week]"
799632174165229569 2016-11-18 15:15:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Caller asks the mayor what he's going to to do to support the union construction trades
799631848678821888 2016-11-18 15:14:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@BrianLehrer asks the mayor "How comfortable are you with the amount of outside money flowing through the NYPD?"
799629444277276672 2016-11-18 15:04:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK this is a big issue, esp at the Timeshttp://deadline.com/2016/11/shocked-by-trump-new-york-times-finds-time-for-soul-searching-1201852490/
799627781504172032 2016-11-18 14:58:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK i catch your drift but usually lazy word choice in a hed in a major publication means lazy analysis too
799627015196381184 2016-11-18 14:55:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @palafo @ReanaMK it's been in headlines constantly recently since the election, to the point where editors are clearly abusing it
799623216763375616 2016-11-18 14:40:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner i mean regardless of whether it's finished...
799622547503509504 2016-11-18 14:37:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> Can you imagine Trump actually building the Gateway tunnel beneath the Hudson? I can'thttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/business/trumps-biggest-test-can-he-build-something-that-inspires-awe.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=D296E67837D375DBAE59CC0E0F1EB3D2&gwt=pay&_r=0
799447250644697088 2016-11-17 03:00:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> It feels oddly appropriate that someone is building one of the tallest buildings in BK within spitting distance of Fred Trump's lil empire
799445437052653568 2016-11-17 02:53:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> And yes, it has a ~porte-cochere~ for those fancy future Coney Island drivers, I guesspic.twitter.com/dipkTbbByf

799379087382843392 2016-11-17 22:30:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> I have a bunch of new renderings for a 40-story tower replacing Trump Village Shopping Center in Coney Island http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/11/new-look-40-story-residential-tower-at-532-neptune-avenue-in-coney-island.htmlpic.twitter.com/fqsbYMN2rh

799365145675735040 2016-11-17 21:34:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro shane they have a fox hunting club that meets on their lawn and was established in 1840
799364363467550724 2016-11-17 21:31:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro if you did not see this I felt like you'd appreciate it
799346697910579200 2016-11-17 20:21:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i know i was just looking at that. but there isn't really an english equivalent.
799346175728111620 2016-11-17 20:19:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Pretty sure the English word for this is "carport" which really does a disservice to most porte-cochres
799345978021122048 2016-11-17 20:18:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm i assume that's more correct. hyphen seems optional but i think the accent is required? idk about fancy french architecture words
799345954537242624 2016-11-17 20:18:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm i assume that's more correct. the hyphen seems optional but i think the accent is required? idk about fancy french architecture words
799345296698470400 2016-11-17 20:15:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Ugh I just used the word porte cochere in a post and feel like it's very pretentious but idk what else to call it

799322880387481600 2016-11-17 18:46:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik yup that's exactly what they did
799319975970254848 2016-11-17 18:35:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i know but when they're not well maintained it sounds like there is a goddamn ghost in your apartment all the time
799319581324152832 2016-11-17 18:33:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism eh i think it would be kinda depressing
799319420933967876 2016-11-17 18:32:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism you're talking about putting an interior bedroom in the passthrough where the kitchen is?
799319065080844289 2016-11-17 18:31:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yeah this is definitely a case where open kitchen and living would have been a better idea
799318387159511040 2016-11-17 18:28:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NeoSkepticism right it's technically not supposed to be?
799318283367436288 2016-11-17 18:28:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism "separate" dining and living and a second bedroom. sort of!
799318197056995328 2016-11-17 18:28:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yeah the passthrough kitchen is weird, but maybe that's the only way they could think to justify this rent
799317516874985472 2016-11-17 18:25:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> For $3250, I don't think anyone wants to deal with banging radiators all winter. Also just this price for a normally sized apt in Bed-Stuy
799316982508191744 2016-11-17 18:23:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> Here's a very nice but absurdly priced two-bedroom in southern Bed-Stuy http://streeteasy.com/building/240-jefferson-avenue-brooklyn/2

799313606873649153 2016-11-17 18:09:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's all very cute but I'd be wondering where the slave shacks used to be

799310328878268416 2016-11-17 17:56:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon @KELLYWEILL yeah i guess its headed that way anyway :-/
799309792900562944 2016-11-17 17:54:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon @KELLYWEILL yeah this is my biggest fear. That the NY-centric coverage will be gutted & NYO will no longer help train reporters
799306573290078208 2016-11-17 17:41:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> This estate is called "Old Wellburne" and dates back to the early 1800s. And the current owner is Pam Bondi's brother.

799105498947665924 2016-11-16 04:22:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel pretty sure those buildings were constructed on top of a railyard so i think there are a number of reasons we couldn't, lol
799104929768030208 2016-11-16 04:20:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> Watching some guys take Trump's name off a building wasn't as gratifying as I'd hopedhttps://twitter.com/NBCNewYork/status/799104420537569280
799097805583351813 2016-11-16 03:52:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL yeah that changed over the last few years. I'm still mad I covered murders and schlepped all over the city for no $$ for NYDN
799097365097541633 2016-11-16 03:50:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL so few places in NYC paid their interns during the academic year when I was an undergrad that I'm surprised they offered to pay
799095453572861952 2016-11-16 03:42:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL oh so you were actually promised a stipend and they just never gave it to you?
799091084613812224 2016-11-16 03:25:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> no definitely not! The decor and fixtures aren't "modular." Even at the factory, the rooms looked normal
799075754034298880 2016-11-16 02:24:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> great views, pretty nice interiors for rentals, lots of weirdly shaped apartments bc weirdly shaped lot

798942082358452224 2016-11-16 17:33:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> First time I saw public housing towers implode was in doc abt Pruitt Igoe, which I can lend you if you want to watch http://www.pruitt-igoe.com/urban-history/
798940302719336448 2016-11-16 17:26:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i guess it's cheaper than full scale demo but it always seems very 1960s
798940218376134657 2016-11-16 17:26:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel ha i think they check pretty thoroughly for people before they blow up a building
798939921717280770 2016-11-16 17:24:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel it's mind boggling
798939695443021824 2016-11-16 17:24:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> Anyway I looked this up and apparently Philly imploded these public housing towers there in March. Didn't even know cities still did this.pic.twitter.com/1Yx74IMFIP

798721795004235777 2016-11-15 02:58:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet lol i think the percentage is much lower than that but it's funny when shows that shoot in NYC make such a blatant mistake

798630232961916928 2016-11-15 20:54:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie the main issues for Oakland developer will be (1) financing and (2) getting stuff done on time
798630051008782336 2016-11-15 20:53:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie most people doing mod construction in NYC now (mid-rises) are working with mod manufacturers in PA
798629894842220544 2016-11-15 20:52:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie getting things in and out of NYC is very problematic. and obviously very expensive to have factories here
798629184260210688 2016-11-15 20:50:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie also i think mod construction would be easier in California, where it's easier to truck stuff long distances
798628921424150529 2016-11-15 20:49:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie I suspect Dean did not work out because the project was poorly managed, not necessarily just bc mod production was super problematic
798628778188546048 2016-11-15 20:48:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie that facade is very not modular looking. i wonder who would build the mods. that ends up being deciding factor
798628190969217024 2016-11-15 20:46:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie tallest finished modular high rise to date
798627553187536896 2016-11-15 20:43:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie there was another modular apartment factory next door inside the Navy Yard which was just priced out. AFAIK never had these issues
798627043957161985 2016-11-15 20:41:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie far from the first but the largest to date. people have been making modular apartments for decades

798624989503229953 2016-11-15 20:33:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nandelabra yes basically
798624692034600960 2016-11-15 20:32:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Developer: This building is the future of construction. Me: What about the lawsuit from the contractor who claimed there were design flaws?
798622701011091457 2016-11-15 20:24:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar given the history of this site, the noise was the least of my concerns

796779320228380672 2016-11-10 18:19:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChappellTracker depressing that it takes a catastrophic election for people to think about local reporting but I'm happy nevertheless
796778599189770240 2016-11-10 18:16:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChappellTracker yeah the money is even more scarce outside of big cities. even here in New York, most local news operations are shoe string
796778307454926848 2016-11-10 18:15:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChappellTracker the issue is also covering policy-oriented local stuff while also figuring out a way to generate revenue/drive traffic
796778113631928325 2016-11-10 18:14:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChappellTracker if you can find someone to fund it, I think you'd have a lot of reporters who would want to work there!
796777953594081280 2016-11-10 18:14:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChappellTracker i think DNAinfo is probably the closest thing that's like more general interest
796777714921472001 2016-11-10 18:13:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChappellTracker I think Politico is trying to do this since they have subject specific-coverage, but their expansion $$ is limited
796777389707628544 2016-11-10 18:11:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChappellTracker & there are special interest sites (like the one I work for) who cover that from specific angle, like land use/real estate
796776995694768128 2016-11-10 18:10:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChappellTracker i agree! local journalism is very hard to fund. here we have Politico NY & Gotham Gazette, DNAinfo, Gothamist

794997042229768192 2016-11-05 20:17:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JGoldny @SoBendito also homeless shelters who want the local CB to be on their side clearly have work cut out for them
794996340677820416 2016-11-05 20:14:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JGoldny @SoBendito however, the hoops involved in getting a homeless shelter c of o might be challenging, idk
794996186293878784 2016-11-05 20:13:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JGoldny @SoBendito i don't think there's a special permit re: buildings or zoning. the issues are largely funding-related.
794993767245815809 2016-11-05 20:04:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JGoldny @SoBendito special permit? what special permit?

794992686600257536 2016-11-05 20:00:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> Goes along w/ my theory that developers release intentionally ugly renderings of as-of-right projects so rezoning looks more attractive

794991061164838912 2016-11-05 19:53:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism maybe Lander will intervene on that
794990458652999680 2016-11-05 19:51:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism what if they get like R8 or C6 type zoning

794988561191862275 2016-11-05 19:43:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> And since it's Cobble Hill, local groups and politicians will get worked up about it!
794987931966590976 2016-11-05 19:41:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> I think they're trying to get a more favorable rezoning. So they're going to pull this all or nothing, be afraid of our ugly towers tactic
794986963183005696 2016-11-05 19:37:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> Developer of LICH is playing politics here. I doubt they're going to forego the rezoning just to piss people offhttp://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/46/dtg-lich-rezoning-dead-2016-11-11-bk.html

794584877723222016 2016-11-04 16:59:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler at this point, i guess it's more embarrassing for the project to fail completely than for the mall to be built?
794584079358459904 2016-11-04 16:56:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler and the admin now supports it after all this hullabaloo about affordable housing... lol. and why IS the AG involved?
794582810568912896 2016-11-04 16:51:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler also the place is already a parking lot so they want to pave over it and put in another parking lot?!

794553712542973956 2016-11-04 14:55:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Another listener asks where the countdown clocks and cell data service are in the subways! Mayor says he'll look into it

794547435263684609 2016-11-04 14:30:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is Kaufman's 10th hotel in the Garment District and his sixth with Sam Chang http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/11/revealed-350-west-39th-street-another-gene-kaufman-hotel-in-garment-district.html

794547038834819073 2016-11-04 14:29:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy #1 is by far the worst. it's a bit of a joke because the architect has a rep for boring and is designing half the city's hotels

791716194063646720 2016-10-27 19:00:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samarkhurshid tbh I think @miller_stephen could have made it stronger 
791690086639370240 2016-10-27 17:16:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nandelabra in the short term, doubling up on tights and/or long underwear from someplace like Uniqlo
791689668626702336 2016-10-27 17:15:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nandelabra literally the best thing I ever discovered. $8 a piece at Nordstrom Rack

791672270301306880 2016-10-27 16:05:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly yeah he actually rolled this out with a dumb animated video set to alicia keys and we were like HOW MUCH IS THIS COSTING CUOMO?!

791657832319950848 2016-10-27 15:08:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ there is plenty of sponsored art but this is a less than tasteful way to do it. i do like the little origami birds though
791636181519888384 2016-10-27 13:42:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> At first I thought this might be real public art and then I realized it was sponsored by Ford

791459029390327808 2016-10-26 01:58:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pauldebenedetto it's left! I agree and I did
791457919938224128 2016-10-26 01:54:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pauldebenedetto I'm assuming if you're fb verified it shows up on tinder? Guessing that's it
791456547096432640 2016-10-26 01:48:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alanalevinson yeah I swiped left lol

791371658246447108 2016-10-26 20:11:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> I guess the parody writes itself when the first photo is of an old man posing in front of La Croix http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/20/fashion/williamsburg-brooklyn-whole-foods-style.html?partner=IFTTTpic.twitter.com/n2HFSO8AWd
791370186712571906 2016-10-26 20:05:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChristRobbins @Azi @LaurenFaceEvans please continue this series
791367487984168960 2016-10-26 19:54:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Azi i think @LaurenFaceEvans and @ChristRobbins are cornering the market on local news parody
791367276603797504 2016-10-26 19:53:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dannydoodar this is like local news clickhole; i love it

791337857172529152 2016-10-26 17:57:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa lol
791337064390389761 2016-10-26 17:53:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm what made it like new haven
791336788187082752 2016-10-26 17:52:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> Maybe they have some similar issues, but significant black/Latino population+poverty+ issues with crime don't make them the same
791336561900130304 2016-10-26 17:51:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> low crime ~rates~
791336298778886144 2016-10-26 17:50:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> oakland has higher crime rates per capita i think because its so much smaller
791336210300035072 2016-10-26 17:50:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> i mean it does! like number of crimes
791336049008074753 2016-10-26 17:49:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> which tweet
791335796632653824 2016-10-26 17:48:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> I just meant it was a poor comparison
791335749232824320 2016-10-26 17:48:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> i kept hearing this in SF and I thought it was odd! I don't think there's anything wrong with either the Bronx or Oakland
791335290426228736 2016-10-26 17:46:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> For one, the Bronx has three times the population and more crime in absolute terms, even if Oakland has higher crime rates
791334580515110912 2016-10-26 17:44:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm interesting! yeah that makes more sense
791334394019676160 2016-10-26 17:43:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> I keep hearing people compare Oakland to the Bronx and this seems a little odd to me...
791330046912958464 2016-10-26 17:26:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL sleeping that extra 10 minutes is my hobby
791329796198395905 2016-10-26 17:25:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL if you're still wearing makeup to work every day, more power to you
791328961200582658 2016-10-26 17:21:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL me every day
791328840916299777 2016-10-26 17:21:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL @NoahHurowitz you guys are the worst
791328542244106240 2016-10-26 17:20:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie that seems even weirder to me
791324559437955072 2016-10-26 17:04:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie people keep comparing oakland and the bronx to me and i'm not sure i see it, though i guess they deal with similar issues
791323040646823936 2016-10-26 16:58:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie yeah makes sense
791322988004118528 2016-10-26 16:57:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie oh i thought you were saying it had one!
791322549527478272 2016-10-26 16:56:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @smithsj i've been eating the normal stuff in manhattan for years
791322247881523200 2016-10-26 16:55:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @smithsj then again if i'm going all the way out to flushing there are far more exciting things to try than xi'ans
791322061591420928 2016-10-26 16:54:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @smithsj i'm always down for weird shit
791321819009671168 2016-10-26 16:53:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @smithsj is it worth going out to flushing to go to the nice one
791321667658215425 2016-10-26 16:52:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @smithsj really need to go soon
791321171849510913 2016-10-26 16:50:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie i was just talking to a kid who got robbed twice in east oakland in the first two weeks he lived there! i have never been robbed
791320836007428096 2016-10-26 16:49:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa you would go
791320717111529472 2016-10-26 16:48:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie we are not SF! It's a much bigger city so they can just not have a store in the Bronx and it doesn't really matter
791320514681856000 2016-10-26 16:48:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple agree! Atlantic Terminal needs a revamp anyway
791320349988229120 2016-10-26 16:47:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> "Sorry, your borough isn't bougie enough yet" is basically how I imagine it if they did respond to this letter
791320057532088320 2016-10-26 16:46:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Apple Store on Fordham Road sounds fascinating
791319942482292736 2016-10-26 16:45:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MartyMarkowitz @erinmdurkin and Williamsburg has been prime Apple territory for like a decade
791319522695344128 2016-10-26 16:44:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> Hm an Apple Store in the Bronx? Can't imagine it tbhhttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161026/mott-haven/ruben-diaz-jr-carl-heastie-apple-store
791314595982041089 2016-10-26 16:24:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie our zoning code has its benefits
791313808023228416 2016-10-26 16:21:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie we have limited gehry in NYC so we're much less sick of him. plus our main gehry tower has nothing swoopy on it
791313368942538752 2016-10-26 16:19:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie you're a gehry hater?

791295798977916929 2016-10-26 15:09:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnJCoyne i'm not sure what the financial incentive would be for that but sounds great in theory

790584025744306176 2016-10-24 16:01:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK differences in our experiences also highlight how WMATA basically has suburban commuters subsidizing good/cheap service inside D.C.
790583806839390208 2016-10-24 16:00:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK yes! i guess it always upset me also that D.C.'s metro doesn't run to a lot of the poor black hoods that it should...

790583410607656960 2016-10-24 15:59:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK and the fact that those fares are extremely high and WMATA has not done basic maintenance to prevent track fires, etc
790583150833438720 2016-10-24 15:58:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK when you add the extremely slow service on the D.C. metro to the insane fares that double during rush hour, no free xfers to buses
790583004158631938 2016-10-24 15:57:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK i guess but i've had similar and worse problems in D.C., especially when traveling from the burbs.
790581950591434754 2016-10-24 15:53:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK better, cheaper, more frequent, and more widely distributed service trumps clean trains any day in my book

789120292601925641 2016-10-20 15:05:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly wtf
789115725772365824 2016-10-20 14:47:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler @MarketUrbanism @miller_stephen i also feel like it's fundamentally tough to compare 12 years in office with two, esp w/hsg
789114419234086912 2016-10-20 14:41:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler @miller_stephen @MarketUrbanism and the tenant right to counsel thing is going to be big too, going along w/ anti-eviction
789109789209063424 2016-10-20 14:23:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> Businessweek runs a feature that's designed to look like the terminal, and it's a bit much for the rest of us https://www.bloomberg.com/features/year-ahead-2017/
789108890604560384 2016-10-20 14:19:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak hard to say, when your audience is clearly people who stare at this all day http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/Bloombergadvanced27.gif
789107526616907777 2016-10-20 14:14:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak clearly this is supposed to sort of replicate the experience of looking at the terminal but why would they do that
789107228531982336 2016-10-20 14:13:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak i love businessweek but this color/layout/everything stresses me out

788932525645180932 2016-10-19 02:39:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Every time I hear Trump talk about Inner Cities, I wonder if he has left Manhattan in the last 20 years
788928121479241728 2016-10-19 02:21:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> He just punted on Wallace's question about Aleppo

788921358700974080 2016-10-19 01:54:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Trump: Those theories [HE MEANS SEXUAL ASSAULT ACCUSATIONS] have been largely debunked !!!!!
788919943458938880 2016-10-19 01:49:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Here we are again with illegal dumping of Chinese steel from Hillary
788916484127031300 2016-10-19 01:35:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> Trump is upset that we're not making more nuclear warheads?

788890422332559360 2016-10-19 23:51:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @ISANobody_ there are other reasons to move to new york that are far more interesting
788884436700069888 2016-10-19 23:28:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TheDustyRebel maybe he lives in the hood
788880160225370112 2016-10-19 23:11:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader the downside is that it gets thick and unmanageable and really styling it requires too much effort
788879684595515392 2016-10-19 23:09:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader mine is a little curly but mostly wavy. when i sleep on it wet it kinda looks like those "beachy" waves everyone loves lol
788879281611018240 2016-10-19 23:07:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader yeah i'm the same except with straightening because fuck that
788878897018462208 2016-10-19 23:06:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader ugh my hair is already kind of unmanageable; i could never do this
788872579914330112 2016-10-19 22:40:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin @varud i think uber won bc they were in a gray area while airbnb is clearly illegal/requires completely rewriting hsg/bldg code
788871516649885701 2016-10-19 22:36:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz this seems like a straight tinder trope but since i'm not a gay man i wouldn't know
788870109121085441 2016-10-19 22:31:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @petersterne wow this continues to seem extremely odd
788869092266704900 2016-10-19 22:27:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple the "cold front" is 80 degrees, isnt it?
788868877451161600 2016-10-19 22:26:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple damn. well it was 80 here today and i actually saw people wearing shorts, if that's any consolation

788843841763835905 2016-10-19 20:46:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb hold on this should work http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/east-harlem/east-harlem-presentation-101816.pdf
788843240749424640 2016-10-19 20:44:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb i'm mad this means i have to fix it in my story too
788842980396392448 2016-10-19 20:43:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb wtf they moved it, i'm sorry
788842872711712768 2016-10-19 20:42:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb really? weird
788842840394719233 2016-10-19 20:42:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb and there's also like ten different types of zoning going on over like 30 blocks
788842672735780869 2016-10-19 20:42:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb also the metro is expensive and closes at like 11 pm or whatever
788842261039706112 2016-10-19 20:40:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb current zoning is quite varied and i'm too lazy to summarize it for you but here's the presentation http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/east-harlem/east-harlem-presentation-10.18.16.pdf

788841458975596544 2016-10-19 20:37:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> New zoning would allow towers up to 30-35 stories along the avenues and remove parking requirements for residential http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/10/initial-east-harlem-rezoning-plan-promises-30-story-towers-and-less-parking.html

788766719158390784 2016-10-19 15:40:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @eean we don't have strong evidence that $15 minimum wage will do more harm than good, and in fact i doubt that's the case
788765957837717504 2016-10-19 15:37:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism anyway, your initial tweet felt like a stretch
788765804389105665 2016-10-19 15:36:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism I mean i guess but clearly he's saying that if we can't build enough affordable hsg right now, raising wages at least helps
788761772765409280 2016-10-19 15:20:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism what does the $15 minimum wage have to do with pricing people out

788736291768786944 2016-10-19 13:39:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @annehelen pretty interesting that this was written by a former NYO real estate writer who was clearly unhappy/had an axe to grind

788534830371901441 2016-10-18 00:18:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold honestly a lot less contextual zoning/height limits than i expected. mostly dense zoning for towers along the big streets
788533791547621377 2016-10-18 00:14:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold yeah def, but there are a decent number of vacant lots, semi-abandoned buildings, and city-owned lots

788192349914529792 2016-10-17 01:37:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Nickthaca haha no its pretty unlikely. plus CSX and LIRR don't like surrendering their ROW, but if they do, it's for a ton of money
788186353515241473 2016-10-17 01:14:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Nickthaca the idea is it could be part of this rather theoretical subway line that links existing freight tracks http://gothamist.com/2013/08/21/the_dream_subway_line_with_20_conne.php
788162989362937856 2016-10-17 23:41:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Nickthaca yeah, tho i guess i can understand not wanting to give up a rail line (even a v defunct one) since you can never get it back
788161681172140032 2016-10-17 23:36:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Nickthaca valley stream is LI but yeah it's just west of Jamaica and runs through several hoods - rego park/forest hills/ozone park
788134849953628160 2016-10-17 21:49:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Nickthaca basically people are holding out hope that the line could be re-activated for transit http://gothamist.com/2014/10/15/queens_high_line_nope.php. also just $$
788134443542257664 2016-10-17 21:47:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Nickthaca yeah literal NIMBY excuses because it's suburban Queens. also rail advocates don't want to lose the ROW http://ny.curbed.com/2014/12/30/10007224/queensway-detractor-claims-argument-for-park-is-uncredible
788133216943239172 2016-10-17 21:42:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Nickthaca we have park proposal like this for old tracks in queens except it's never happening because it runs by people's backyards

788113472001286149 2016-10-17 20:24:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat @MC_NYC the lighting must be insane. must have huge flood lights, to take these portraits at night w/so much potential movement
788109984009682945 2016-10-17 20:10:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat tbh i am a little surprised because i feel like this is basically every day in the village
788109879416348672 2016-10-17 20:10:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat they were offended by the large gathering of naked people in front of the arch?

788039209571459073 2016-10-17 15:29:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> Sorry I wrote this post when I was rather tired last night, but it's been updated with all of this
788037259316621312 2016-10-17 15:21:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> All of these changes were approved by BBP corporation board in June 2016, after state withdrew its financial support http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/10/permits-filed-for-oda-designed-towers-in-brooklyn-bridge-park.html
788036431004459008 2016-10-17 15:18:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday sadly i didn't get a photo because he moved too fast!
788036247956627456 2016-10-17 15:17:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday i saw one scurrying up Bedford Avenue at night last week, just kind of running up the sidewalk/darting btwn cars
788032278425399296 2016-10-17 15:01:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold sorry not reneged, but the plans were dramatically altered in June after ESD withdrew, lawsuits, etc http://www.wsj.com/articles/vote-is-set-on-apartment-towers-inside-brooklyn-bridge-park-1464802442
788027845238988800 2016-10-17 14:44:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC testament to how unremarkable those buildings were, i guess.
788027255096242177 2016-10-17 14:41:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold unclear. i guess they could be filing more stuff in a third building or something, but they're def not on this set of plans
788026866712141824 2016-10-17 14:40:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> However the cut in units appears to be for the condos. Basically the same number of affordable apartments as promised
788026631101251584 2016-10-17 14:39:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> No trace on these plans of a preschool, community space, or a second ground floor retail spaceall of which were promised last year
788026304264372226 2016-10-17 14:38:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> The last two towers in Brooklyn Bridge Park are finally happening, but with fewer apartments than BBP promised http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/10/permits-filed-for-oda-designed-towers-in-brooklyn-bridge-park.htmlpic.twitter.com/4euhEYJteM
788020677165088768 2016-10-17 14:15:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @4rilla lame. maybe CSX's doing?
788013438169706497 2016-10-17 13:46:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC i guess some preservationists were upset about the demo of the Carrere and Hastings building
788012600667824129 2016-10-17 13:43:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Oh this might be the best part of this Saddam had a dungeon in his UES mansion piece. It was converted to a kitchen http://nypost.com/2016/10/12/inside-saddam-husseins-secret-nyc-torture-chamber/pic.twitter.com/JXfdWr2VsY

787035492764291072 2016-10-14 21:00:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple when you compare it to similarly massive towers like 1 WTC and 432 Park, it has a little more character
787035173980344320 2016-10-14 20:59:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple supposedly it will be the second-tallest building in the city, after 1 WTC

787020033310482432 2016-10-14 19:59:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ariellauren is this trint?
787019846827515904 2016-10-14 19:58:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik LES/East Village is really the prime fire escape territory IMO
787019738044043264 2016-10-14 19:58:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik this is in the lower east side. idk, maybe i should start one

787001165053566976 2016-10-14 18:44:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> New policy of editing photos every time I'm tempted to read Trump coverage is working out well so farpic.twitter.com/jas8DYRc4q
786999827297173504 2016-10-14 18:39:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 i was like oh editing pics is so much more therapeutic, screw this election
786999572623138816 2016-10-14 18:38:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 also trying to force myself to edit photos every time i want to read horrible trump coverage, since i have HUNDREDS of pics to edit
786998954663739392 2016-10-14 18:35:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 yeah easier with dropbox IMO. at least i can go through by the date and find stuff that way
786998713608798209 2016-10-14 18:34:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 i just automatically upload all my iphone photos to dropbox and then download them if i need. it's dumb but still somehow easier
786997012743028736 2016-10-14 18:28:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 true, but what else do we really have on a mac, besides equally garb proprietary software
786974763998703616 2016-10-14 16:59:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Oh Staten Island - this is from a piece about Trump voters there http://www.silive.com/opinion/columns/index.ssf/2016/10/in_search_of_donald_trumps_sta.htmlpic.twitter.com/CrqL9xVPJE

786718203753992193 2016-10-13 00:00:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> Real good Jezebel piece about a local TV reporter who killed herself on air in 1974 and the movies it inspiredhttp://themuse.jezebel.com/why-a-reporters-1974-televised-suicide-resonates-now-mo-1787597676?rev=1476390626586&utm_campaign=socialfow_jezebel_twitter&utm_source=jezebel_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow
786701339556470784 2016-10-13 22:53:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin since whole point of libel is whether you're damaging someone's reputation, and they point out that he did that all on his own
786700765779877888 2016-10-13 22:50:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin the fact that it made NYT journos feel better is a nice side bonus
786700652504313856 2016-10-13 22:50:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin well they addressed the actual legal issue while making it a fuck you, so i think it worked on both fronts.
786700135116013568 2016-10-13 22:48:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin i actually think it was a pretty clever discussion of what libel per se is
786691193862139904 2016-10-13 22:12:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak yeah Matteo was the one I was unsure of

786677297818562560 2016-10-13 21:17:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly yeah i assumed the TV networks, i forgot about the wire services and of course other major newspaper companies

786276202365358080 2016-10-12 18:43:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dylanlove it takes me months to get around to transcribing anything. having to record without notes is like an extreme last resort now
786250354061107200 2016-10-12 17:01:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ more protectionist than Trump? Lol

785853369298616321 2016-10-11 14:43:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple honestly i'm surprised he doesn't inspire more conspiracy theories
785851786766721026 2016-10-11 14:37:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj no doubt! clearly she got slammed in breitbart and elsewhere
785850885519863808 2016-10-11 14:33:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabydvj sorry i realized that's in your story; i just skipped over it

785849946075459585 2016-10-11 14:30:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> The art and Milo's performance seems basically irrelevant....Though I'm rather disappointed to see Wallplay hosted it
785849068673232896 2016-10-11 14:26:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> Of COURSE Gavin McInnes said this to the Gothamist reporter after his and Milo's insane pro-Trump art show http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/pro_trump_art_show.php#photo-11pic.twitter.com/TQm9fTq7XG

785653357394272256 2016-10-10 01:28:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax i mean not exactly i guess because they're still renting out the rooms to homeless men indefinitely?

785636131027070976 2016-10-10 00:20:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin this is confusing. did they say for how long they are housing homeless people there? are they doing a temp contract?
785635883676409856 2016-10-10 00:19:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> They are not converting the building but they are still housing homeless men there? Uh...https://twitter.com/erinmdurkin/status/785625267301593088

785626340233998336 2016-10-10 23:41:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 @DGisSERIOUS @MarketUrbanism seems the permit was never granted. it only says processed

785625705522528256 2016-10-10 23:38:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 @MarketUrbanism @DGisSERIOUS however the property sold for a good amount of money in July so I'm sure something will happen soon
785625319030026240 2016-10-10 23:37:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 @MarketUrbanism @DGisSERIOUS i doubt that's true. they do not have a demo permit if the address is 995 President.

785612487878021120 2016-10-10 22:46:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald as long as you're going with someone else, you'll be fine! knocking on doors is in some ways worse than street canvassing

785582936661827584 2016-10-10 20:49:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> As @miller_stephen reminded me, he covered up historic facade of the Commodore Hotel in '76 http://archpaper.com/2016/08/trumpian-public-space/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/back-donald-trump-start-real-estate-new-york-gallery-1.2589647?pmSlide=1.2589635
785580283424899072 2016-10-10 20:38:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> He took out a $170 million construction loan... and put his 60-year lease on the building up as collateral, so if he defaults, bank gets it
785579222882455553 2016-10-10 20:34:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> How did Feds let Trump near the Old Post Office? He wanted to cover it with gold leaf. Have they seen Trump Tower?https://www.buzzfeed.com/aramroston/how-donald-trump-won-control-of-a-prized-dc-landmark?utm_term=.jlyBoQDMe#.yfzRy9rx0

785298812168462337 2016-10-09 02:00:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> Anderson asks Trump if he's going to talk about how long it's been since he paid personal income taxes!

785294709665230849 2016-10-09 01:43:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Martha asks whether the Muslim ban still stands and Trump won't answer directly, mentions "extreme vetting" of immigrants
785292771468910592 2016-10-09 01:36:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> The way Trump keeps pacing behind her is very unsettling

785263046730125312 2016-10-09 23:37:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb tried to figure it out by googling to no avail. interesting criticisims of it here thohttp://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/06/where-to-start-when-it-comes-to-city-of-quartz-mike-daviss-1990-polemic-against-the-rampant-privatization-and-gated-communi.html
785262768119246848 2016-10-09 23:36:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i mean just look at that last sentence in the photo that starts "Welcome to post-liberal LA..."
785262089820602368 2016-10-09 23:34:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i think it would appeal to you if you can get past the tone
785260757588008964 2016-10-09 23:28:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> Fwiw, it was written by Marxist who clearly saw L.A.'s urban planning & policing in a v class-based context & shaped his narrative that way
785260138064179203 2016-10-09 23:26:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb i wish it had more footnotes so i could catch what he glosses over for sake of maintaining his flow. like wtf is this satellite?
785259552187056128 2016-10-09 23:24:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb but apparently it's one of the few incisive and wide-ranging histories of LA's urban planning/policing issues in 70s/80s
785259363749523456 2016-10-09 23:23:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb but i think the tone is a bit pretentious and it seems like people have a lot of problems with it then and now
785259113081102336 2016-10-09 23:22:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb i think it's fun so far. but i was looking for stuff about architecture and policing and some urban planners recommended it

785237689784229888 2016-10-09 21:57:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SeanMcElwee not saying he should be, but my point is you don't even need to peg him to a lawsuit aimed at his dad. he has shit of his own

784826848404500481 2016-10-08 18:44:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand basically they would all have to be tossed; it takes time to print/mail/count ballots; some states lack resources to do it again
784826599128633345 2016-10-08 18:43:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand as other folks in this thread have noted, 34K republican ballots have already been cast in republican battleground states
784826106767613952 2016-10-08 18:41:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand highly recommend WaPo explainer on why they cannot boot Trump off the ballot https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/07/theres-no-longer-any-way-for-republicans-to-boot-donald-trump-from-the-ballot/?postshare=8581475936416269&tid=ss_tw.

784505930196979712 2016-10-07 21:29:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts there was a fire and service got shut down between lorimer and manhattan for eight hours. seems major to me

783710468699459584 2016-10-05 16:48:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb ahaha i hope it's that easy. problem is parts of it aren't super bike friendly/have many highways
783709696670703620 2016-10-05 16:45:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb plus if you have a bike, D.C.'s crappy metro won't bother you so much if you live someplace off an inconvenient line

783485885375516676 2016-10-04 01:56:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> He won't totally say it out right either, but he's gotten extremely close
783485738335830016 2016-10-04 01:55:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> Pence hasn't denied that they want to completely ban Syrian refugees

783039529322160128 2016-10-03 20:22:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kath_krueger apparently the New York Times opinion section
783038145243836416 2016-10-03 20:16:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> "All work-from-home creatives should find rich partners, but in the meantime, the work boots might help" https://medium.com/@JamieLaurenKeiles/one-tip-for-working-from-home-551adc034dcc#.x7rii2pyk

783006142582648832 2016-10-03 18:09:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> He has a 60-year lease with the feds, so at least we know he's stuck with this for a while if it fails
783005596496830466 2016-10-03 18:07:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also it is wildly expensive even by DC standards and might end up being a huge flop w/o the high-profile restaurants http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/donald-trumps-old-post-office-hotel-financial-flop

782977236001513472 2016-10-03 16:14:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ceaweaver is RAD considered a better program than HOPE VI? just from reading about it, it seems less extreme

782966568032567297 2016-10-03 15:32:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts it just makes it more expensive when you do build, and it makes it more expensive for people to maintain their own properties
782966462768111616 2016-10-03 15:32:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts also with respect to evelyn, she's wrong that people won't develop if a nabe is landmarked
782965842820599809 2016-10-03 15:29:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts this is like some gentrification-holocaust comparison stuff
782965729608032256 2016-10-03 15:29:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts also "social cleansing" DAMN
782965497461608449 2016-10-03 15:28:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts "affordable to whom?" as the housing activists like to say
782965132502663168 2016-10-03 15:26:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts i feel like the "last battle" thing may have been more her editors than her, but yeah still a lot of assumptions being made here
782964776217538560 2016-10-03 15:25:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ceaweaver i'm interested in how HOPE VI funding was used in NYC too; trying to find out more about that
782964171575099392 2016-10-03 15:22:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts oh yes that too! last time i checked, bushwick was still cheaper place to buy a house than crown heights. maybe e bed stuy too?
782960324639072256 2016-10-03 15:07:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts also the report she quotes clearly doesn't talk about individual hoods. but i guess that's where she got the wage data
782959765634818048 2016-10-03 15:05:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts at least she waited seven grafs to mention the riots
782955002646192130 2016-10-03 14:46:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's good she talked to a few real tenants and mentioned both Rivington House and the Bedford Union Armory debacle
782954326851457024 2016-10-03 14:43:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> Another day, another piece about gentrification in Crown Heightshttps://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/03/last-battle-brooklyn-new-york-americas-most-unaffordable-place-buy-home?CMP=share_btn_tw
782946932423585792 2016-10-03 14:14:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> That time NYT did a millennial media Room for Debate on Pepe http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/10/03/can-a-meme-be-a-hate-symbol-6/a-meme-can-become-a-hate-symbol-by-social-consensus

782943434810228736 2016-10-03 14:00:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz oh my god it's millennial media room for debate
782790673074356224 2016-10-02 03:53:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale does it get too crowded on the weekends, like breakneck?
782785072638337024 2016-10-02 03:31:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @aymanndotcom you're actually there?
782768985934823424 2016-10-02 02:27:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @resnikoff depresssinggggg
782760874943578113 2016-10-02 01:55:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly maybe businessweek wouldn't do this, but someone should
782719794151907328 2016-10-02 23:11:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_alexsommer yes I am familiar! Just found those recently and have been researching
782695861658628096 2016-10-02 21:36:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg wow! lots of itemizing then
782694143315288064 2016-10-02 21:30:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg how did you do them yourself and feel confident that you weren't losing huge amounts of money?
782694053318107136 2016-10-02 21:29:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg scary! a friend who's been freelance for about a year and a half got an accountant pretty quickly & did em quarterly
782692756602941440 2016-10-02 21:24:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg did you do quarterly taxes?
782691805779427329 2016-10-02 21:20:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg hey i just started watching and i like it
782687389475037184 2016-10-02 21:03:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome eh whatever, i don't believe the governor's plan is going to happen either so i guess it's kind of immaterial
782678582497869824 2016-10-02 20:28:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy i feel like a lot of this was driven by the fact that high rise public housing projects were hard to police?
782678249914638340 2016-10-02 20:26:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> This NYT interactive about the renovation plan for Penn Station is fun http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/30/opinion/penn-station-reborn.html?smid=tw-share

782674041240969217 2016-10-02 20:10:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> This NYT Mag piece is interesting and touches on these issues a bit - how cops deal with different terrain/hoodshttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/magazine/panopticops.html
782673318457540609 2016-10-02 20:07:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm interested in how policing/security affects urban planning and architecture, if anyone knows of things i could read on that topic
782672640553148418 2016-10-02 20:04:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> Many people defend it, since it did improve quality of life for residents. Just not as many as had lived in projectshttp://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/new-york-citys-public-housing-crisis/393644/
782670807151570945 2016-10-02 19:57:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> Starting doing research on HOPE VI today and I'm kind of angry about it http://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/housing/gov-revisiting-hope-public-housing-programs-legacy.html

781988213774774279 2016-09-30 22:44:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade I can't imagine native New Yorkers being too familiar with what a Baltimore accent really sounds like, but idk
781987885369163776 2016-09-30 22:43:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade i guess i need to meet you again! maybe a little bit, but not compared to a lot folks i know from "Bawlmer"

781938176327901185 2016-09-30 19:26:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn agree!
781936171337277440 2016-09-30 19:18:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn well you have DCP, the politicians, the activist groups, community boards, and then nasty rando commenters
781935449010999296 2016-09-30 19:15:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn its worse when no one goes and then you realize people dont even know whats going on
781935326990364672 2016-09-30 19:14:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn I like the controversial ones because it means people care, but writing about them is stressful bc of backlash
781930608574562304 2016-09-30 18:55:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @ericgoldwyn if you have never sat through a controversial public meeting in the bronx or brooklyn, you may not know lol
781928260989030400 2016-09-30 18:46:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @ericgoldwyn more just the stress of those crazy public meetings
781928137269579776 2016-09-30 18:46:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @ericgoldwyn haha no not necessarily
781926133466066945 2016-09-30 18:38:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair shh don't ruin CNN with facts

781897179635994624 2016-09-30 16:43:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> NYPD recently honored one of the cops who shot Diallo, was acquitted, and spent 13 yrs trying to get his gun backhttp://nypost.com/2016/09/15/cop-acquitted-in-amadou-diallo-shooting-gets-honored/
781896394479140865 2016-09-30 16:40:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> Every time I write about Soundview I end up reading about Amadou Diallo, who was shot 41 times by four cops in 1999http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/05/nyregion/officers-in-bronx-fire-41-shots-and-an-unarmed-man-is-killed.html?pagewanted=all
781894222706274305 2016-09-30 16:31:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jeremywins cool! i'm going to try to make it over to BOS at some point this weekend, just not able to tonight
781893515500515328 2016-09-30 16:28:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jeremywins is your stuff only up tonight?
781879471787868160 2016-09-30 15:32:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale @MosesNYC @Urbablurb @2AvSagas i have a friend who PA'd with them last winter and they shot at fort wadsworth in SI.
781873236363644929 2016-09-30 15:08:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale @MosesNYC but The Get Down is also not a good show. and like a lot of it is obviously filmed in ENY/uses crappy stock footage
781871889161543680 2016-09-30 15:02:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald this only strengthens my need for a cat, even one who will interfere with literally every task i do
781868363865792512 2016-09-30 14:48:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale what do you think of it so far?
781868118306070528 2016-09-30 14:47:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale also luke cage's bar in Jessica Jones is supposed to be in "Hell's Kitchen" but it's obviously on Tompkins Square Park
781867618982658048 2016-09-30 14:45:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale hell's kitchen is rarely hell's kitchen. in jessica jones, hell's kitchen was the Upper West Side
781867206745395200 2016-09-30 14:44:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale hopefully they actually shoot it in Harlem!
781863052668960768 2016-09-30 14:27:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas explain?
781710718013964288 2016-09-29 04:22:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jbouie really lovely!
781691182367776768 2016-09-29 03:04:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie @MarketUrbanism @ISANobody_ mmm this is brick painted white but not really what stephen is getting at, this building is much older
781687820968660993 2016-09-29 02:51:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie @MarketUrbanism what buildings near NYU are we talking about
781663873069879298 2016-09-29 01:16:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold @JoeTacopino do you guys know?
781661196579635200 2016-09-29 01:05:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull this would be a good thread to pin
781658863938535424 2016-09-29 00:56:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> it's not necessarily the zoning itself (though if it's a dramatic up/rezoning, it can be), but how real estate folks react
781656311708594176 2016-09-29 00:46:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> or because investors approach LLs and offer them $$ with similar aims
781656143705681920 2016-09-29 00:45:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> from my experience, it's largely bc LLs hear about rezoning, know their property is worth more, try to harass out tenants/sell
781650115022954496 2016-09-29 00:21:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak fwiw many transit issues raised at this meeting! People seem pretty frustrated with lack of elevators at elevated 4 train stops
781649373168017408 2016-09-29 00:18:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> Anyway, not trying to shame anyone, just a sidenote on why I like covering this kind of stuff. Since I've spent lots of time explaining that
781646131877076992 2016-09-29 00:05:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak and the reporters who are left and capable can't do everything
781645841660600320 2016-09-29 00:04:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak they had outer borough bureaus. I guess it never made much money which was why it was the first to go during cuts
781645562907066368 2016-09-29 00:03:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak yeah but they did it for decades until they were literally hemorraging money a few years ago. it was financial more than anything
781645090703994881 2016-09-29 00:01:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak both. The tabs used to have dedicated reporters for the Bronx, but I don't think they do anymore
781644461843607552 2016-09-29 23:58:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> I know NYDN used to have a Bronx bureau. Did the Post? Older reporters would know better than I
781644127054200833 2016-09-29 23:57:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> Frustrating that metro desks at the major papers often lack the resources/will to cover these issues in these communities
781643328832081921 2016-09-29 23:54:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> I am thinking mostly of Jerome, East New York, Stapleton
781642878867079168 2016-09-29 23:52:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Poorer communities face the greatest risk of displacement as a result of BdB rezonings and get the least coverage in mainstream press
781630730178822144 2016-09-29 23:04:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller maybe they were ripped out or they're just underwater!
781629841087008768 2016-09-29 23:00:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller i guess these were freight tracks?
781629310713098240 2016-09-29 22:58:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller on vacation?
781628525098983424 2016-09-29 22:55:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i never underestimate the NYPD's thirst to over-police the bronx tho
781628086064406529 2016-09-29 22:53:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism activists are arriving now so yeah it may be related.
781627541698338816 2016-09-29 22:51:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> Honestly I've never seen this many cops in and around a public rezoning meeting either
781627143788912640 2016-09-29 22:50:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @steadyblogging it's sort of close - it's more on on east side of the bx, BxCC is on the west side. you could take a bus or walk 1.5-2 miles
781624267679133696 2016-09-29 22:38:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JazzGtrSteve yeah i had a prof in undergrad who was pretty old and had taught at the bronx campus in the early 70s
781622643338469376 2016-09-29 22:32:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Btw this is in Gould Memorial Library, an amazing historic building http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/nyregion/an-opulent-bronx-library-in-decay-and-in-search-of-a-purpose.html?_r=1&module=Endslate&region=SlideShowTopBar&version=EndSlate&action=Click&contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&slideshowTitle=Inside%20the%20Gould%20Memorial%20Library&currentSlide=Endslate&entrySlide=1&pgtype=imageslideshow

781617959819218944 2016-09-29 22:13:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> Cops told me it had to do with the Chelsea bombing and the fact that we were at Bronx Community College
781617546038546432 2016-09-29 22:11:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> This meeting in the Bronx is the first time I have ever had my bag searched by the cops at a public meeting hosted by DCP

780460653396058116 2016-09-26 17:34:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald have you done a tiny letter recently? i'm not sure if i've just missed them the past month or if you haven't been doing them?
780454627007430656 2016-09-26 17:10:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito well if you're discussing a company where wages are already relatively high, what we're really talking about are job protections
780453177946730496 2016-09-26 17:05:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito and given that new york is not a right to work state, they are def breaking the law by discouraging union activity
780452256734904320 2016-09-26 17:01:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito i don't think unions dramatically increase costs for employers in these kinds of white collar companies

779560362945413120 2016-09-23 05:57:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nandelabra @donewman i have done it!
779559832869302273 2016-09-23 05:55:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nandelabra well i can tell you 6 doesn't go past city hall in manhattan :D. if you are ever stranded off the numbered trains in BK, hmu
779558948894539777 2016-09-23 05:51:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nandelabra me neither! i dont think it was in the forecast. i was wearing flip flops and a long skirt with slits on the sides, so...

779448053292003328 2016-09-23 22:31:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @UntappedMich Did DOC talk about what kind of security they have around the island? I mean probs the Coast Guard...
779447254918782976 2016-09-23 22:28:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @UntappedMich Maybe they just lucked out! afaik North Brother is closely patrolled because it's close to Rikers; not sure about Hart.
779444828744650752 2016-09-23 22:18:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> Anway, since you can do that, they might as well open it up to the public at some level
779444299087900672 2016-09-23 22:16:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> One of my friends accidentally kayaked to Hart Island recently and wandered around and didn't get in trouble? Idkhttp://untappedcities.com/2016/09/23/photos-stepping-onto-hart-island-nycs-mass-burial-ground/

779414761729560577 2016-09-23 20:18:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold too bad you missed this one, it was funhttp://newyorkyimby.com/2016/09/broadway-triangle-meeting-shut-down.html
779413545821831170 2016-09-23 20:14:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold haha well the upside of the evening meeting is that it was perfectly pleasant

779408459208990720 2016-09-23 19:53:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold i went to the 6 pm one and it was pretty dead. were there a lot more speakers for 2 pm?
779392100077043712 2016-09-23 18:48:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> Yay @Rubin415!https://twitter.com/danielleiat/status/779375789787709440
779376030452678656 2016-09-23 17:45:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm i also had people continually asking me why i was in SF, and i responded the same way. i just had to get the fuck out of new york!
779375472597696512 2016-09-23 17:42:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm just read it, it was wonderful <3
779371424553242629 2016-09-23 17:26:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> also rents in ithaca seem so cheap! is there really a need for subsidized housing?
779371151512436737 2016-09-23 17:25:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> and like everything property tax-related in NYC, it's controlled by the state legislature so nothing ever really gets fixed
779370811656376320 2016-09-23 17:24:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> oh, yeah our tax and assessment system is complex. hold on i wrote about it at one point http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/06/why-new-yorks-property-taxes-punish-mid-size-landlords-and-poor-renters.html
779369275534479361 2016-09-23 17:18:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> do single-fam owners get taxed at a much lower rate than multi-unit buildings? (which is how the tax system works in NYC)
779367809948192769 2016-09-23 17:12:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito wait you have snapchat
779367653689401344 2016-09-23 17:11:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> what's the tax situation like there?
779366725125083137 2016-09-23 17:08:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> Like I think I've added 200 words to it already
779366576218902528 2016-09-23 17:07:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> I published a story yesterday but I keep adding stuff and tweaking it because I am incurably obsessive
779366012298952704 2016-09-23 17:05:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm might as well go to the gowanus whole foods while you're down there
779365948029595648 2016-09-23 17:04:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm yes now that i look it up, it's in the park slope/gowanus borderlands on 4th Ave
779365374617907200 2016-09-23 17:02:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mcwm i feel like i biked by this recently but now i can't remember where it was
779358162931548160 2016-09-23 16:34:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sdevlin7 @SDevlin7 hey, nice meeting you the other day! did you end up making it to the broadway triangle meeting?
779356606681190401 2016-09-23 16:27:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm too real for friday afternoon, larissa
779355239493361666 2016-09-23 16:22:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> but ithaca is planning to change the tax abatement to require affordable units?
779353659293466624 2016-09-23 16:16:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> sure. and as the abatement is structured now, it's purely location based like 421a was, right? no affordable hsg required?
779352710181158912 2016-09-23 16:12:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> so are you saying that developers in ithaca don't have strong incentive to build affordable right now?
779352554585088000 2016-09-23 16:11:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> But the anger here speaks to the unresolved issues in North Brooklyn that came out of Bloomberg's rezonings and planning
779352100841152512 2016-09-23 16:09:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> Broadway Triangle is interesting case, & not cut and dry bc of the communities involved. Shutting down meetings may not be a solution...
779351737018769408 2016-09-23 16:08:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> yeah definitely! Im sure there are a lot of similar issues. But the phrase community incentives usually means not tax breaks
779349904556695552 2016-09-23 16:01:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> oh youre talking about tax abatements in exchange for affordable hsg, like 421a but at the city level
779348288181010432 2016-09-23 15:54:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> so you mean community incentives in exchange for supporting affordable housing at local level (CBs or whatever you have there)?
779347571848409088 2016-09-23 15:51:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> what do you mean here?
779347084680040448 2016-09-23 15:49:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KonradPutzier i think the comment might be a joke... unclear
779346358276878337 2016-09-23 15:47:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> ICYMI, folks in South Wburg are fighting a big development bc they are concerned it repeats history of racist zoninghttp://newyorkyimby.com/2016/09/broadway-triangle-meeting-shut-down.html

779330466688200704 2016-09-23 14:43:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Interesting ANHD map that combines loss of rent regulated units, property sales, etc to predict risk of displacement http://map.dapmapnyc.org/app/#close
779326011477557248 2016-09-23 14:26:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> All of this data is publicly available on the DOB or the city's open data portal, but can be challenging to find
779325689396924417 2016-09-23 14:24:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> The startup also listed complaints about mold, bed bugs, roaches, heat and hot water problems during the winter..
779325158427361280 2016-09-23 14:22:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> Citi Habitats started displaying building violations on rental listings. Lasted 8 days before landlords complainedhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/realestate/why-isnt-there-a-landlord-blacklist.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0
779324171021066240 2016-09-23 14:18:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> the fact that Citi Habitats caved to landlords so quickly is upsetting too.
779322712225357824 2016-09-23 14:13:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> what about the city's worst landlords list?

779065434473697280 2016-09-22 21:10:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GwynneFitz @DaveCoIon @NoahHurowitz we had a good time i think
779064831659958272 2016-09-22 21:08:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @YFeyman i.e. a process where they have more say over what happens
779064633403535360 2016-09-22 21:07:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @YFeyman they want a rezoning process that mimics what typically happens when the city initiates a rezoning rather than a private developer

779063191850590208 2016-09-22 21:01:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @YFeyman the issues remain the same, both at the community level and with the way the city handles rezonings

779061449536761856 2016-09-22 20:54:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @YFeyman basically this rezoning is controversial bc there was a previous rezoning here that favored Hasids over black/Latino folks...

779060002271133696 2016-09-22 20:49:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @YFeyman i'd say it's not really that cut and dry here

777946831514894336 2016-09-19 19:05:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman @ptrmsk aha i mean this price might be a little high, but if the reno actually looks good someone will buy it
777946449036345344 2016-09-19 19:04:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @caleweissman i believe they are selling condos over by the Halsey/Wilson L for more per square foot than this house
777946285903060992 2016-09-19 19:03:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @caleweissman and about the original listing, this isn't that crazy for a renovated bushwick two-fam actually
777946124153946112 2016-09-19 19:03:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @caleweissman omg!! was it also in bushwick?
777945843924144128 2016-09-19 19:01:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @caleweissman dang this sounds awesome
777945790023081984 2016-09-19 19:01:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @caleweissman the girl subletting it had put a small couch in and couldn't fit an actual bed frame. i slept on a futon on the floor
777945598540513281 2016-09-19 19:00:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @caleweissman oh that sounds horrible though, railroad. i lived in an actual (but small) bedroom in clinton hill for $600 in 2009
777944957885767680 2016-09-19 18:58:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @caleweissman and was it an actual bedroom with windows
777944888038002688 2016-09-19 18:58:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @caleweissman omg how many people did you live with
777943540009734144 2016-09-19 18:52:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm honestly i've only read like 30% of it and then i read balk's take and i don't even need to read the rest https://theawl.com/the-internet-is-killing-you-and-youre-begging-for-more-b3e94d73f27#.wybivgkvg
777942590528352257 2016-09-19 18:49:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaylorLorenz like obviously you need to separate out the work-life balance issues too
777942356221886464 2016-09-19 18:48:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaylorLorenz well and it seems like he also created a job for himself that meant he had to be constantly in it...and drove himself crazy
777942185266319360 2016-09-19 18:47:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaylorLorenz true! i gathered that much from what i did read, which was through the first graf or two about the meditation retreat
777941660424605696 2016-09-19 18:45:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexBalk @TaylorLorenz ahahaha link me to this?
777940933664997377 2016-09-19 18:42:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaylorLorenz i haven't read the whole thing yet, but broad strokes, what don't you agree with?
777939734341513216 2016-09-19 18:37:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TheDustyRebel i'm not sure how long it's been like this; apparently i just never look at fb live video
777928890790580224 2016-09-19 17:54:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> I can promise you that no one wants to see this constant annoying stream of stuff at the bottom of their live video

777900721748443136 2016-09-19 16:02:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz even better that this is his actual professional name rather than one he made up for NYDN

777899848460804096 2016-09-19 15:59:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle "monolithic shelters"?
777899585591214080 2016-09-19 15:58:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle so your issue is only with siting it in maspeth, not necessarily with siting it elsewhere in CD5?
777899403298340864 2016-09-19 15:57:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle right, but the other half of the argument you and i were having was about the fact that this large CD lacked shelters
777898994152402945 2016-09-19 15:55:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle maspeth isn't the only community at play in this fairly large area of queens
777898867702521856 2016-09-19 15:55:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle you're not acknowledging that CD5 covers like 3-4 hoods. why not site shelter in ridgewood or one of the other hoods?
777883699371212800 2016-09-19 14:55:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull everything in this city has to be scumbag-proof, including terrorist explosive devices

777630639994597376 2016-09-18 22:09:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller being able to reach the ceiling has become a major issue in my life the past few months, so it's worth it!

777610841256497152 2016-09-18 20:50:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> So I would rather go out and buy a taller stepladder than deal with my creepy super

777601288561430528 2016-09-18 20:12:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you're an idiot like me who decided to go to the Chelsea Home Depot today, it is open via the back entrance on 22nd Street

776883264132964356 2016-09-16 20:39:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SarahEvonne yeah! sad but true. hard to make a living doing reporting too, for very different reasons. but a bit more marketable
776882180496756737 2016-09-16 20:35:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SarahEvonne also i guess it strongly depends what kind of writing we're talking about!
776881978595545089 2016-09-16 20:34:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SarahEvonne writing FT is also a grind for most of us! there are definite trade offs

776853824728395776 2016-09-16 18:42:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @brooklyn11211 @JacobGarchik also alterations tend to be cheaper, esp if you're keeping the frame of the house
776853283981914115 2016-09-16 18:40:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @brooklyn11211 @JacobGarchik also alt-1s are eligible for other tax abatements still in effect, like J-51

776845006132969472 2016-09-16 18:07:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon ahahaha me too. but i think it takes a certain kind of formerly very broke person to appreciate it
776844519241293824 2016-09-16 18:05:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Honestly the fact that this isn't a legal bedroom (lack of window, size) is the least of the issues here
776843429124997120 2016-09-16 18:01:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @morninggloria @irin possibly! but it usually takes a lot for the city to kick ppl out of illegally converted places. like imminent danger

776837899887206401 2016-09-16 17:39:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @AdvisoryA and in fact, until very recently, if it was potentially going to be developed you could not get parks protection
776837764159574016 2016-09-16 17:38:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @AdvisoryA it is actually pretty challenging to get your garden protected by the parks department.
776837009293905920 2016-09-16 17:35:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito and for how long?

776092086093373440 2016-09-14 16:15:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple yeah very strangely worded. i guess they have to notify all 426 and half will be laid off, is what i gathered.

776083735972352000 2016-09-14 15:42:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kath_krueger how else should they refer to it?
776081407705841665 2016-09-14 15:33:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler term sheets for low-income rentals expire. affordable condos/co-ops don't. ownership=better protection against displacement
776080760902213632 2016-09-14 15:30:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler my personal feeling is that this would be a really good opportunity for affordable condo/co-op ownership!
776080563581190149 2016-09-14 15:29:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler like besides the nice PR angle, how much do you really help poor folks by building less low-income hsg in $$ neigborhood
776080124978618370 2016-09-14 15:28:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler that being said, if the city has the means and motivation to build a ton of low-income housing here, they should!
776079866110341120 2016-09-14 15:27:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler i guess the question is do you want to fund 40 low income units in crown heights or like 100 in east new york?
776079658517426176 2016-09-14 15:26:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler it's an expensive project. low-income housing units would cost much more here than they would two-three miles east or south
776078039700602880 2016-09-14 15:19:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon @MaxRivlinNadler the fact that the activists who pressured him into this wont be happy with any realistic proposal is frustrating
776076116650065920 2016-09-14 15:12:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler @DaveCoIon eh
776073579104526336 2016-09-14 15:02:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale also this sounds like an end-run solution around what must be a flawed tax assessment system (like new york's!)
776073437823500288 2016-09-14 15:01:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale or you would still be selling your equity to some group of investors?
776073183162228738 2016-09-14 15:00:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale oh interesting! so you're talking about a deal with the city, not outside investors?
776072196863225856 2016-09-14 14:56:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale awww
776072108950581249 2016-09-14 14:56:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale it also just doesn't seem like a great deal for a lot of buyers, unless you think your house is going to depreciate
776071866595303424 2016-09-14 14:55:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale haha not if you have Andreesen Horowitz and Lawrence Tosi on boardhttp://a16z.com/2016/09/13/point/
776071378340569088 2016-09-14 14:53:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale as Matt notes, the idea has been around at least that long, but it's not clear if it's going to work in the long-term

775914472531636224 2016-09-13 04:30:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexParkerDC but yeah to me the issue of transferring/legally seizing property/bankruptcy comes up immediately
775913474115325952 2016-09-13 04:26:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexParkerDC idk! i'm talking about it with my real estate folks over on this thread tho, they know better than ihttps://twitter.com/SoBendito/status/775912743299866626

775911766563909632 2016-09-13 04:19:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexParkerDC what do you mean? like if you want to transfer it, do they remain part owners?

775909694053449728 2016-09-13 04:11:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism seems like there would also be potential legal issues? also would many mortgage lenders are ok with this? @chaykak
775909400414486528 2016-09-13 04:09:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak also great, excellent, CFO of airbnb who is also former CFO of blackstone is involved. what could go wrong??
775908975472697344 2016-09-13 04:08:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is weird. People who know more about real estate finance than I do - does this make sense? For houses?https://twitter.com/chaykak/status/775907171808796672
775908838176354310 2016-09-13 04:07:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak unclear to me what happens if the person who owns the majority of the house goes bankrupt/defaults/gets their assets seized

775776577137278978 2016-09-13 19:22:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> But hey, look at Battery Park City and Flushing Meadows Park! Also built on garbage
775775443924418560 2016-09-13 19:17:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @daweiner i think that's pretty much what gothamist says too
775775318116229120 2016-09-13 19:17:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> I will never stop being amazed that we made a pile of trash in Staten Island into a nice parkhttp://ny.curbed.com/2016/9/13/12891320/freshkills-park-nyc-staten-island-engineering-design
775774886111375360 2016-09-13 19:15:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @daweiner or maybe just 70s, which is i'm guessing when these cars were made

775730918778662913 2016-09-13 16:20:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull i guess i've never really believed there is a unified southern culture, but maybe you do
775730113811972096 2016-09-13 16:17:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull they have and hunt them in Louisiana also
775729681781891072 2016-09-13 16:15:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull i know people who hunt and eat alligators in the FL panhandle. if that's not the south, i don't know what is.
775728865696215040 2016-09-13 16:12:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jltdawg @amandamull depends which part of VA we're talking about. southern and western VA has always felt like the south to me
775728739858673664 2016-09-13 16:11:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull talking about the florida panhandle if that was unclear
775728407476920320 2016-09-13 16:10:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull the panhandle is the south, that seems unavoidable
775728335188000768 2016-09-13 16:10:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull maryland is a weird place, particularly the western/country part and the little peninsula

775723278702874624 2016-09-13 15:50:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar actually this looks like a studio, not even a 1 bed
775723110117105664 2016-09-13 15:49:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jeremywins revising this tweet again since this apartment actually appears to be a studio
775722885201690624 2016-09-13 15:48:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i think this is not even a one-bedroom. it looks like a studio!!

775720983701454849 2016-09-13 15:41:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner @MarketUrbanism well kingsbridge might be more $$ than kingsbridge heights
775720787936419840 2016-09-13 15:40:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner @MarketUrbanism Kingsbridge Heights used to be one of those places!

775522632158576640 2016-09-12 02:32:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rmc031 and she was the EIC of CJR! i hope she's just settling into the job. definitely big shoes to fill after margaret sullivan.
775520749750714368 2016-09-12 02:25:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rmc031 i still have not gotten over her metro coverage one
775520620792705024 2016-09-12 02:24:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rmc031 she seems to spend more time justifying their bad decisions rather than explicating them. and failing to confront big issues
775518703270170624 2016-09-12 02:17:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik but i can see your confusion, since flatbush historic districts are also very restrictively zoned
775517762152267784 2016-09-12 02:13:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik and landmarking & rezonings are politically different processes, even if sometimes the effects are similar
775517522607140864 2016-09-12 02:12:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik kind of. but landmarking does not preclude development, whereas restrictive downzonings do.
775511831460872194 2016-09-12 01:50:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik the editorial is about rezoning, not landmarking
775500771064418306 2016-09-12 01:06:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @derektmead oh man I can't imagine a $5000 bike you don't even own potentially getting stolen
775484299080531968 2016-09-12 00:00:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @derektmead i didn't realize how expensive these were!! yeah valid
775483705485881344 2016-09-12 23:58:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @derektmead taking off the front wheel is already one step further than i go, but this is probably a more $$ bike than mine
775475177064894464 2016-09-12 23:24:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @stephen_job it's basically everywhere, unfortunately

775458326071144448 2016-09-12 22:17:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @fitnr @MarketUrbanism well except for prospect plaza, which was in fact torn down. but otherwise yes
775457644911988737 2016-09-12 22:14:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @fitnr NYCHA demo'd a large housing project recently, but it's only because they completely fucked up. i don't see them doing it again soon.

775451844055273472 2016-09-12 21:51:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rolandlisf @MC_NYC definitely programmers!
775451638412808193 2016-09-12 21:50:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito evidently the rendering is poorly executed also, i didn't look this closelyhttps://twitter.com/fitnr/status/775449560567144448
775451000610164736 2016-09-12 21:48:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @fitnr people screw up renderings all the time. but the actual copy mentions fixing up red hook houses, not demoing it
775450758535843840 2016-09-12 21:47:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rolandlisf ha thanks! i know someone else there too. i just meant maybe why it's not in the comptroller report
775449848090857472 2016-09-12 21:43:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @fitnr i don't see anything about demoing the public housing, just building next to it
775449520222113792 2016-09-12 21:42:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rolandlisf places like cushman and wakefield track those square footage and average rent numbers and expect $$ for the data

775448478700998656 2016-09-12 21:38:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @wrightwb bigger engineering challenges, more dangerous, issues with just getting your big equipment in and out, waterproofing
775446114631872513 2016-09-12 21:28:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @mtsw @ndhapple we'd be edging into East Side Access type territory, and those tunnels were already in place
775445929969065985 2016-09-12 21:28:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @mtsw @ndhapple exactly. and this is a tunnel under the river, so automatically more expensive/time consuming than SAS
775445702667341824 2016-09-12 21:27:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple @2AvSagas @mtsw idk three billion sounds low to me!
775445607506927617 2016-09-12 21:26:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple @2AvSagas @mtsw both these numbers are made up tho
775445266325467136 2016-09-12 21:25:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple @2AvSagas @mtsw i can't imagine the costs being similar... boring a whole new cross-river tunnel...
775444892440989696 2016-09-12 21:24:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple @mtsw @2AvSagas that's true, 1 train extension under neath the container terminal wouldn't really help existing community
775444226372952064 2016-09-12 21:21:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple @2AvSagas not to mention the fact that Port Authority won't just give all that land/easements away for free...
775443806632247296 2016-09-12 21:19:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple @2AvSagas also i doubt the PA would be cool with this
775443575567949824 2016-09-12 21:18:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple @2AvSagas but the 1 train? weird
775443253185437696 2016-09-12 21:17:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @ndhapple and WHAT ABOUT THE FLOOD PROOFING

775439109745770496 2016-09-12 21:01:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rolandlisf but yeah, finance folks abandoned the hood in droves during the crisis. apartments were so cheap!
775438793235132421 2016-09-12 20:59:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rolandlisf i assume it's a combination of both, given how much office space was destroyed in 9/11/how fearful people were about returning
775437185768103936 2016-09-12 20:53:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> Here's the comptroller report on this, which is for some reason not linked in Joe's story http://www.osc.state.ny.us/osdc/reports/rpt4-2017.pdf
775436916414156801 2016-09-12 20:52:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> Meanwhile FiDi is losing office space to residential conversions, like 70 Pine, Woolworth Building, One Wall Street, etc
775436423243661312 2016-09-12 20:50:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> But we haven't yet rebuilt 15 million square feet of office space lost in the terror attacks (comptroller says now 9-10 million square feet)

775431672313573383 2016-09-12 20:31:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet what do you mean
775431311242752002 2016-09-12 20:30:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Apparently Union Market owners and others are planning 1,160 apartments in the hood, along with more fancy restaurants etc

774736351493255168 2016-09-10 22:28:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Definitely a print mentality that there should only be one, unified version of a story, rather than iterative ones http://www.cjr.org/analysis/times_article_trump_clinton_forum.php
774736084026662918 2016-09-10 22:27:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nycsouthpaw my guess is this was driven by print deadlines. they had burns' story as a placeholder just in case Healy didn't finish in time

774437109771988992 2016-09-09 02:39:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism they don't have any bus making the same stops as the AirTrain so getting out of here is a pain

773938238104834048 2016-09-08 17:37:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford there are also no numbers behind those percentages... i'm pretty skeptical. public meetings i went to didn't reflect this

773930115503763456 2016-09-08 17:04:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> My one beef w/this piece is that they don't note Midland Beach wasn't offered state buyout. They didn't "retreat behind a $580 mm seawall"
773929505152913408 2016-09-08 17:02:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple they "stubbornly decided to rebuild behind a $580 million seawall" bc the state didn't offer to buy their property
773929341092712448 2016-09-08 17:01:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple but yeah it's kind of lazy. also i'm slightly annoyed by the fact that he doesn't note Midland Beach wasn't offered the buyout
773928925080588289 2016-09-08 17:00:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i feel like he started the first person thing just so he could talk about living in gowanus at the end

773749020669857792 2016-09-07 05:05:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism FOIL is such a garbage process
773748817757736960 2016-09-07 05:04:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @laura_nelson @martinepowers @MarketUrbanism hey, we have like three chinatowns, not 741
773742217034727424 2016-09-07 04:38:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nycsouthpaw @WilliamTurton it also seems like Alex's original post was better? pretty odd
773740591075119104 2016-09-07 04:31:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nycsouthpaw @WilliamTurton I'm fundamentally confused about what happened here
773737571977355264 2016-09-07 04:19:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nycsouthpaw so it's just a totally different story than the original one...?
773737088382447617 2016-09-07 04:17:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ohheygreat as someone visiting from New York, I have no sympathy for people complaining bc it hit 75 in SF
773721746251714560 2016-09-07 03:16:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> Btw this place is very legit! I recommend it if you're ever in Outer Richmond
773706126604967936 2016-09-07 02:14:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> This restaurant has been here since 1974! So few things endure that long in NYC, but maybe there are more older businesses in SF

773621301655117824 2016-09-07 20:37:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple @rolandlisf DC is similar, except the fares double during morning/evening rush. ~$5-6 each way from suburbs during peak times
773619959293325312 2016-09-07 20:32:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KensingerNathan its very cute! The hills are pretty insane though
773619398447763457 2016-09-07 20:30:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple BART doesn't double the price during rush hour
773618553253617664 2016-09-07 20:26:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, the BART reminds me of DC metro, except it's cheaper, runs much more frequently, and has older subway cars
773618210608328704 2016-09-07 20:25:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> The novelty of SF's historic streetcars wears off after about a minute, when you realize that you could walk faster
773608059931287552 2016-09-07 19:45:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @curbedchicago @plitter the bakery deserves an award! the cake is impressive
773602697266069504 2016-09-07 19:23:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> She bought her house here for $25K. Now it's worth a million
773602527673585664 2016-09-07 19:23:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> Was just chatting with an adorable elderly Mexican lady who's lived in SF since 1950 and Bernal Heights in 1979.

773597044061515776 2016-09-07 19:01:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple they've been making a resurgence in the last two years or so, but i didn't really see them the first several years i lived in NYC
773596771612143616 2016-09-07 19:00:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> Highly recommend staying in apartments with cats while traveling
773596591814873088 2016-09-07 18:59:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i remember seeing them at the first public meeting in williamsburg about the l train shutdown and it really annoyed me.

773575903288832000 2016-09-07 17:37:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes airbnb friend thinks uber is much worse, like company culture-wise and in terms of the way they treat their employees
773575445157515265 2016-09-07 17:35:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon yeah he was much less aware of the impact Airbnb has on housing markets in SF, NYC, elsewhere...clearly the company downplays it
773575068735541249 2016-09-07 17:34:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> Apparently you can register your apt with the city to Airbnb here in SF, but the process is so laborious that people don't want to do it
773574786395934720 2016-09-07 17:32:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon but the employees are aware of the racism/bias that plays out on Airbnb, and they know it's basically completely illegal in NYC
773574506161971200 2016-09-07 17:31:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon they really believe in the idea that they're helping middle-class people make ends meet
773573890647863296 2016-09-07 17:29:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> Got to catch up with my friend who works at Aibnb. Always fun realizing how entrenched people are in tech companies' corporate mythology
773566916103286785 2016-09-07 17:01:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> I like how "hot" weather in SF is in the mid-70s
773334017865158657 2016-09-06 01:36:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dylanlove ok! I was genuinely wondering because I'm totally unfamiliar. Clearly I need to look into it

773188191620694016 2016-09-06 15:56:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dylanlove I guess you typically don't have to call EMS, but as random bystander, how can you know someone's not having a larger crisis?
773177369813102592 2016-09-06 15:13:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dylanlove I want to hear it! And idk if I did the right thing but the sounds she was making... it sounded like she was choking
773176525772296192 2016-09-06 15:10:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dylanlove I wonder why she didn't tell the other girl she was epileptic... She didn't know what was going on or how to handle it
773176165972316162 2016-09-06 15:08:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dylanlove roommate #1 didnt know roommate #2 was epileptic, and since neither spoke much English, I had to deal with 911 & paramedics
773175871494459392 2016-09-06 15:07:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dylanlove it was two Chinese roommates who just moved in together and didnt know much about each other.
773027211251097600 2016-09-05 05:17:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> So one of the girls living in the apartment where Im Airbnbing for tonight just had a seizure? Called 911 for her so hopefully shes ok

772163321202114560 2016-09-03 20:04:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle you're not acknowledging they'd hate it anywhere. i agree with you it's a bad location but the CD should have a shelter
772162306616750080 2016-09-03 20:00:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle if it were in a heavily resi area, they'd fight it even harder. which is too bad, since queens doesn't have many shelters
772161906920554496 2016-09-03 19:58:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle you can't exempt these three neighborhoods just because this project is shitty, is my point, i know the location isn't good
772161688498044930 2016-09-03 19:57:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle ok, but like where else should it go that all the neighbors wouldn't rail against? where would be better?
772161025672146944 2016-09-03 19:55:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle i know it's industrial, but you can't tell me this huge area of Qns shouldn't have single shelter, even if it's not there
772160243853881346 2016-09-03 19:52:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle i would but i'll be out of town sunday through friday! i am taking an actual vacation
772159702973161477 2016-09-03 19:49:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle i guess my question is where else should it go that DHS could afford and has transit, since most of this CD lacks subways
772159299506298880 2016-09-03 19:48:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle that huge community district has zero shelters. are there any other budget hotels around there offering to become shelters?
772158626643443712 2016-09-03 19:45:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle i'm not saying they are, but poor neighborhoods of color should not have to keep accepting most of the shelters
772157952115535873 2016-09-03 19:42:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle i think the neighborhoods with the highest concentration of shelters speak for themselves https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150824/belmont/map-10-community-districts-carry-bulk-of-citys-homeless-shelters

771775161985097732 2016-09-02 18:21:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mrohrmann you're not going to change people's minds if they have no sympathy for neighborhoods already burdened w/ shelters/rehab centers
771774810393378816 2016-09-02 18:20:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @donewman i think stephen was referring maspeth and neighborhoods like that
771774695649705984 2016-09-02 18:20:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mrohrmann ultimately it doesn't matter because the city can do it regardless of whether they support it
771774572383395840 2016-09-02 18:19:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mrohrmann BdB can go back to doing it the way Bloomberg did, which was just steamrolling the CBs and not caring about public opinion
771774318602809345 2016-09-02 18:18:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @donewman true, just rich and white!
771774164176867328 2016-09-02 18:17:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism so this is basically about how the mayor doesn't want to lose voters in maspeth or whatever
771773175319367681 2016-09-02 18:13:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism you know, can't DHS do this without the community boards? i mean it doesn't really matter what they think, ultimately?
771772823169798144 2016-09-02 18:12:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i'm also slightly confused by the CD numbers.
771771286674608129 2016-09-02 18:06:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mrohrmann also @MarketUrbanism has the interesting suggestion of building them in the hoods with least housing production
771770743352881152 2016-09-02 18:04:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mrohrmann DHS doesn't need their permission to do this either, but the administration is trying to pretend they care
771770636763033601 2016-09-02 18:03:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mrohrmann the answer is that people need to accept that each neighborhood needs to accept their share of this burden
771768854917816320 2016-09-02 17:56:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mrohrmann it's not fair to only build shelters in some (mostly poor) neighborhoods but not in ones with white people who can mobilize.
771761008641765377 2016-09-02 17:25:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ConalDarcy @KELLYWEILL @DaveCoIon @NoahHurowitz allegedly
771760290228760576 2016-09-02 17:22:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald my mom had a trench like this in the 90s (and i think she still has it actually)
771758692316438528 2016-09-02 17:16:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ConalDarcy @DaveCoIon @NoahHurowitz @KELLYWEILL yes, i wholeheartedly support this
771758576096378880 2016-09-02 17:15:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull maybe he is just a nostrand avenue person
771758013501808641 2016-09-02 17:13:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull have you seen him? i sometimes wonder if i imagine him
771757445354061824 2016-09-02 17:11:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull favorite neighborhood fixture is the elderly black man dressed all in white (button down, slacks, dress shoes) on white bike
771757156450332672 2016-09-02 17:10:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @KELLYWEILL @DaveCoIon i mean how else do you explain eating hot oatmeal when it's 95 outside
771756998270545920 2016-09-02 17:09:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_grendan have fun! hope you're going someplace cool.

771754062278787072 2016-09-02 16:58:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL what kind of muffin is it tho
771753876789886976 2016-09-02 16:57:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL is that actually pumpkin spiced
771753811601924097 2016-09-02 16:57:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL i'm still drinking iced coffee
771752113152069632 2016-09-02 16:50:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> Not to mention that majority of new homeless shelters get built in poor communities of color, which helps neither the hood nor the homeless
771750519618596864 2016-09-02 16:43:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism ha then flatiron is a good candidate, isn't it
771750171508084736 2016-09-02 16:42:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> And yes I live near a homeless shelter too
771749205081751553 2016-09-02 16:38:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle and the people turning their backs at that meeting don't care where the homeless go, they just don't want it near them
771749045983440896 2016-09-02 16:38:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle if they're fighting one in a shitty location on the highway, they'll def fight one with transit and nice parks nearby
771748865519288320 2016-09-02 16:37:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle mitch, we're having two different arguments here. when the community doesn't want it, the location won't matter
771747905673846784 2016-09-02 16:33:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle if this were in a more residential area, i think the old white community of maspeth would be even more pissed
771747644750360576 2016-09-02 16:32:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle i've heard. but i live down the street from a huge mens' shelter. my sympathy is limited bc every hood has to do their part
771747311374495749 2016-09-02 16:31:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle as much as maspeth doesn't want to admit it, continuing to shunt shelters to poor black hoods isn't great for them either
771746985514852352 2016-09-02 16:29:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle the fact that people in flatiron are fighting one too...basically everyone has to shoulder some of this burden
771746623852580864 2016-09-02 16:28:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle separately from the industrial stuff, which you know has a longer history, maspeth isn't only community fighting a shelter
771746191876947968 2016-09-02 16:26:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle i mean i understand that, but at the same time, the city doesn't get a ton of choices when it comes to shelters..
771745343658717185 2016-09-02 16:23:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle also the opposition is clearly based on the fact that people don't want it there, not because they think it's inhumane
771744900656291840 2016-09-02 16:21:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle you mean just based on the location?
771744196604616704 2016-09-02 16:18:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime DHS never gives up property since they can't afford to buy more, so 23rd regiment one is going to be a shelter indefinitely
771743193700466689 2016-09-02 16:14:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime meanwhile bedford union armory has to go through ULURP and tbh i'm not sure it'll make it
771743112989401089 2016-09-02 16:14:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime so if we're talking about the castle-like 23rd regiment one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23rd_Regiment_Armory, it will remain a homeless shelter AFAIK
771742632519340032 2016-09-02 16:12:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brooklyn11211 could be in BK Heights!
771742509231931393 2016-09-02 16:12:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime or rather, bedford and atlantic
771742318391070720 2016-09-02 16:11:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime do you mean bedford and fulton?
771742123750203392 2016-09-02 16:10:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> If everyone fights homeless shelters in their neighborhood, we will never get any new homeless sheltershttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160902/flatiron/plan-for-flatiron-shelter-on-hold-after-angry-neighbors-flood-meeting
771741545141764096 2016-09-02 16:08:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kath_krueger do it! and then tweet lots of photos so the feline-less among us can live vicariously
771740841291419648 2016-09-02 16:05:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kath_krueger are you getting one??
771740714447335425 2016-09-02 16:04:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabrielsnyder wasn't a bunch of DFW's work published posthumously?
771739477211488256 2016-09-02 16:00:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brooklyn11211 oh! this is cool
771738576325410816 2016-09-02 15:56:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brooklyn11211 so i'm confused, they're marketing the site?

771736266073317377 2016-09-02 15:47:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_john_sherman i often get a migraine when people use the word gentrification in print now, it's kind of crossed over into meaninglessness
771734213481598977 2016-09-02 15:39:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_john_sherman i think it's pretty neighborhood specific! each boro is so big and diverse, i guess i always hated generalizations like that
771733734278168576 2016-09-02 15:37:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_john_sherman i mean which neighborhood are we talking about?
771733349505310720 2016-09-02 15:35:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> I am trying to take an actual vacation so of course a hurricane is coming
771733017660358657 2016-09-02 15:34:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chayesmatthew in your district?
771710240677105664 2016-09-02 14:03:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sammeller evidently the homeless shelter did not get the same friendly reception
771579254622461954 2016-09-01 05:23:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull because real New Yorkers make out in the back of cabs
771482524698763265 2016-09-01 22:59:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen ha are you citing yourself as a source there near the end? http://observer.com/2016/09/de-blasio-refuses-to-answer-question-from-the-propagandistic-new-york-post/
771481221532712960 2016-09-01 22:53:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz seems a little counterintuitive that they are embracing a major upzoning in Midtown East but hate this one homeless shelter
771480153683812352 2016-09-01 22:49:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> And the question was about the credentials of the guy training COs at Rikers to use tasershttps://twitter.com/GloriaPazmino/status/771479128952434689

771465706651127808 2016-09-01 21:52:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @taylorjwofford no i am probably going to wait like a week or so and see if they keep doing it before i get pissy
771465592293515264 2016-09-01 21:51:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @taylorjwofford i used to have a neighbor who sang and was terrible, so far dudes playing guitars is slightly better than that
771465489105158144 2016-09-01 21:51:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @taylorjwofford ugh i don't think so
771465456087597056 2016-09-01 21:51:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 it will probably be a few weeks before i confront them; maybe they'll stop
771464301534216192 2016-09-01 21:46:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @taylorjwofford all sorts of things. sometimes it's speed rock or metal, sometimes pop. now i think they are actually playing/practicing
771464035220979712 2016-09-01 21:45:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> I really hope they are not in a band
771463923908415488 2016-09-01 21:45:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> My new neighbors smoke cigarettes inside and play insanely loud music all afternoon. It's been like three days and I'm already pissed
771459987650519040 2016-09-01 21:29:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito ughgg.. the idea that we should just house homeless people outside of the city... that it's not taxpayers' problem
771459780858773504 2016-09-01 21:28:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito i have weird northern VA hometown pride about Five Guys :D
771454099590119424 2016-09-01 21:06:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katie_honan ha yeah I know there are a number of white working class hoods like this in Queens, but wow so many people coming out
771453508356829184 2016-09-01 21:03:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> The opposition to and anger about this homeless shelter in Maspeth is still mind-boggling http://gothamist.com/2016/09/01/maspeth_homeless_shelter.php
771433420803153921 2016-09-01 19:43:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism this is clearly two houses
771428122667483139 2016-09-01 19:22:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito my beef w/ it has to do not only with that but like how it affects your ability to get a mortgage etc. our garb 1950s tax system!

771405901995581440 2016-09-01 17:54:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> While doing research for this post I discovered that people in the neighborhood thought this was going to be a homeless shelter
771405652828774400 2016-09-01 17:53:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn and it's worth considering that Louis Pink Houses (a little north of here) is so dangerous because it's isolated

771404713992617988 2016-09-01 17:49:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Do you ever think about the fact that some of the city's most affordable housing is being built in a neighborhood not served by the subway?!

771126882230276100 2016-08-31 23:25:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat @NoahHurowitz @rachelholliday @JoeTacopino clearly the Post keeps you young
771125431974191105 2016-08-31 23:20:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat @NoahHurowitz @rachelholliday guys I might need this also; how are we all such bad millennials
771125051458486272 2016-08-31 23:18:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb I love graffiti but I do not love this
771123566809088000 2016-08-31 23:12:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Oh no http://www.vulture.com/2016/08/king-arthur-getting-a-police-procedural-reboot.html?mid=twitter_vulture
771093789482049540 2016-08-31 21:14:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jennydeluxe @JMizgata i wonder if you and @amandamull are tweeting about the same jacket?
771092958326251524 2016-08-31 21:11:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity @amandamull but if you don't mind layering it under other things...
771092881809543169 2016-08-31 21:10:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity @amandamull i feel like it wouldn't be great during the summer & by the time it's cool enough you'd have to wear stuff on top
771092445350199296 2016-08-31 21:08:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull @biocuriosity i feel cold just looking at it
771090780484149249 2016-08-31 21:02:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is a liepic.twitter.com/IXOqyQDSq7
771090436958121985 2016-08-31 21:01:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur i love her, she is too real for all times and that's why it's perfect
771089602975240193 2016-08-31 20:57:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> Whenever I've been having a bad day recently I go through the Ask Polly archives, and this one is goodhttp://nymag.com/thecut/2016/05/ask-polly-why-do-i-always-want-unavailable-men.html
771073262407286784 2016-08-31 19:52:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand in real life, this case probably never would have made it out of grand jury, so i guess the point is moot anyway
771072988900945920 2016-08-31 19:51:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand in NYC, the DAs don't allow cases to go to trial if they're not 100% sure they can win. too many loose ends and shoddiness here.
771066054340739072 2016-08-31 19:24:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand for a DA to take a case like this IRL and not get the conviction bc the cops didn't do due diligence would look extremely bad
771065218118090754 2016-08-31 19:20:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand in a case that would've gotten that kind of coverage & been higher profile, yeah. bc not being thorough is grounds for a mistrial
771064491740192768 2016-08-31 19:17:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand right, and i think his point is that it's bad plotting for a show that touts itself as an accurate crime procedural
771064185816055808 2016-08-31 19:16:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand a number of the criticisms registered for me but parts of it felt too harsh
771064098419335168 2016-08-31 19:16:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand which part?
771061565172903937 2016-08-31 19:06:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand i really liked it but lots of issues, esp w/ Kapoor & Naz himself. i liked Matt Zoller Sietz's takehttp://www.vulture.com/2016/08/night-of-didnt-live-up-to-its-best-moments.html
771049267553267713 2016-08-31 18:17:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple the contract thing is really problematic... esp if you're doing anything with land use or transportation
771046981078835200 2016-08-31 18:08:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robertcaruso as you can tell, i am mad about it
771046909582667776 2016-08-31 18:08:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple or makes you wait so long for docs that the story is old and pointless
771046439917068289 2016-08-31 18:06:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> So they can fulfill your request when the contract gets signed! Or never! Great
771046213571506178 2016-08-31 18:05:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> Agencies can reject FOIL requests that "impair present or imminent contract awards or collective bargaining negotiations." How fun and vague

771038239574650880 2016-08-31 17:33:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay @MarketUrbanism imagine if the city did this. it would be madness!!
771038109798662146 2016-08-31 17:33:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay @MarketUrbanism maybe! not sure who checks it regularly. i don't know of any other agency that posts them publicly like this
771035883189444608 2016-08-31 17:24:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay http://corpinfo.panynj.gov/pages/public-records-fulfilled-requests/
771034360183189504 2016-08-31 17:18:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay i think most of them are fulfilled. very recent ones get denied because of "ongoing procurement" (an excuse i've gotten before)
771034200585695233 2016-08-31 17:17:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> i guess i've always had more pressing matters lol.
771032771196227584 2016-08-31 17:11:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> Apparently the Port Authority publishes every single FOIL request they receive! I see lots of familiar names on here
771032179862298626 2016-08-31 17:09:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon yes! the RFP process is not transparent.
771029523559223299 2016-08-31 16:58:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @gabrielabarkho @emanuelmaiberg seems like it's worth separating motherboard from vice dot com in this discussion
771028040751181829 2016-08-31 16:53:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon AFAIK they are not really considered a city agency but they are a "public development corporation," whatever that means
771027326587047936 2016-08-31 16:50:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon sorry i was wrong, you can FOIL them! but they're not on the city's open records site for some reason.
771022966247264257 2016-08-31 16:32:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat this is so thorough! awesome work putting this together
771022547907383296 2016-08-31 16:31:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat this is some extremely legit FOILing, Danielle. you put in a request with the mayor's office directly?

771010756892585984 2016-08-31 15:44:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_grendan also interesting that vice has a union in canada... do their US folks have any kind of union protection?

771004923379126272 2016-08-31 15:21:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro so i thought it was for sale, based on what you tweeted, but he's just trying to repair his very old house, which is more sad

769206384697180160 2016-08-26 16:14:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy yeah they can't really help you. as a journalist, i deal with DCP all the time and they sort of have to talk to me
769205248493846528 2016-08-26 16:09:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy also what do you mean "at Land Use"? DCP? or are we talking about the city council or something
769204921723944961 2016-08-26 16:08:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy elaborate?
769204239780503552 2016-08-26 16:05:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy it's easier to admit that you're powerless than to admit that you're bad at your job

769190410803617793 2016-08-26 15:10:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader @AdamAtSCI DC could def use more of that kind of thing

769189518259937280 2016-08-26 15:07:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull yeah everyone is different about it. for me it feels like an easy way of expressing that i care about someone
769189112922382337 2016-08-26 15:05:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull plus it's a relatively affordable way to spend time together, and he can help you with the cooking, etc

768599465032900608 2016-08-24 00:02:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito not a ton of people in the bottom 20 or 30% of earners citywide paying market rate rents in legal housing w/o subsidy
768595690310209536 2016-08-24 23:47:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito why is that surprising?
768538387989032961 2016-08-24 20:00:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito i've heard other reasons why he's opposing it that have nothing to do with this

768506360782880768 2016-08-24 17:52:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnJCoyne it's not used at all! but the railway companies often demand lots of money, even for rights to unused track
768505653639905280 2016-08-24 17:50:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnJCoyne i agree!! also the gigantic parking lot for South BK Marine Terminal. but who knows if CSX still has rights to those tracks!!
768494802291818496 2016-08-24 17:06:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @rmc031 but yeah it would have been nice to see fuller interviews online and do the condensed version for print
768494151147122688 2016-08-24 17:04:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @rmc031 also you're limited by who is willing to be photographed, if each one has to have a photograph
768494068150198272 2016-08-24 17:03:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @rmc031 my guess is they asked a good number of people. like 15-20. but if this is going to print, have to be selective
768493903301451776 2016-08-24 17:03:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @rmc031 i guess these would be questions for @Mireyawrites and the NYT metro editors

768489810361249792 2016-08-24 16:47:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @johnedwinmason ahaha yeah. i mean you're right but people love a lot of art that also reflects society's oppressive/racist tendencies
768488515873243136 2016-08-24 16:41:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @johnedwinmason true but it's also a great illustration
768483729123708928 2016-08-24 16:22:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vinbarone ahahah i didn't know this would be such a divisive topic. tiling and grouting is a lot of work! these are def easier
768481754374086656 2016-08-24 16:15:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad ahahaha yeah
768481129036996608 2016-08-24 16:12:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> They come in lots of colors and styles, including "stone" and hipster pressed aluminum http://www.homedepot.com/b/Kitchen-Countertops-Backsplashes-Backsplashes/N-5yc1vZbcsz
768480632267767808 2016-08-24 16:10:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @guan it's like a PVC plastic type thing
768480148710711296 2016-08-24 16:08:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad city likes to roll things out so they have accomplishments to tout. but seizing property thru eminent domain can take years & $$
768479359653019652 2016-08-24 16:05:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> And for @amandamull, yes the adhesive home depot wall tiles come in subway tile white http://www.homedepot.com/p/Smart-Tiles-9-70-in-x-10-95-in-Mosaic-Decorative-Wall-Tile-Peel-and-Stick-in-Subway-White-SM1020-1/202016981
768478800892071940 2016-08-24 16:03:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_grendan @woolie well at least you can remove them and put on new ones if you don't like them
768478135012712448 2016-08-24 16:00:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_grendan @woolie this is why i don't read the Vows section
768476753677410304 2016-08-24 15:55:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad why? this is run of the mill city politics stuff
768475746021048320 2016-08-24 15:51:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> "Van Bramer now has 'constituents all over Sunnyside & Woodside stopping me in the street and saying, Dont let that man push you around.
768475560674750464 2016-08-24 15:50:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> Seriously what is happening here? http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/08/in-ongoing-housing-spat-councilman-says-de-blasio-cant-disrespect-me-104928
768474541211455488 2016-08-24 15:46:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad nah not particularly, but they won't discuss it with journalists on record until they're sure they can acquire it
768473177643188224 2016-08-24 15:40:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad they have thought this part through. enough open property in sunset park that it's pretty easy for them to make that choice

768470838592974848 2016-08-24 15:31:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @foldedsunset the previous tweet was about the maintenance yards - they know exactly where they want to put them
768470132679147520 2016-08-24 15:28:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @foldedsunset they have pretty specific locations in mind, they just don't want to freak out property owners and community boards
768470017319002113 2016-08-24 15:28:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> Gentrification: the number of low-wage workers living in District drops from 43 to 39%, high-wage workers on the rise, up from 24 to 27%
768469221483347968 2016-08-24 15:25:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> About 30 percent of the District's workforce of around 800,000 actually lives in D.C. http://dcist.com/2016/08/who_lives_and_works_in_dc.php
768466761486245888 2016-08-24 15:15:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull rip the fulton street goodwill store. i recommend just hopping on the train and going to the goodwill in downtown bk
768455655032250368 2016-08-24 14:31:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DLHDara i can see it on the gigantic parking lot of the south brooklyn marine terminal and/or the area next to Bush Terminal Park
768454962082877440 2016-08-24 14:28:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DLHDara yes probably, and i think there'd be flood proofing. what i've heard is that they want to build the yard in Sunset Park.
768450822011248640 2016-08-24 14:12:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> I thought the city already had sites in mind where they would build/create a yard for the BQX streetcars?http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160823/REAL_ESTATE/160829956
768445350638215168 2016-08-24 13:50:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> The mortgage is $15,000 and the monthly condo fees are $3,400! Wow. So he's losing $6400 a month on this particular lease
768444786521042944 2016-08-24 13:48:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> The hearing about Nick Denton's apartment is today, and he has dropped the rent another $1500 via @joepompeopic.twitter.com/XeQWId5ST8
768440922942169088 2016-08-24 13:32:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith wow the post had two reporters work on this story and one of them probably spent some real time on that alliterative sentence
768440202603982848 2016-08-24 13:29:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith i want to say this is the first time i've seen "masked perp" in this context, but there's no way that's the case
768439449487286272 2016-08-24 13:26:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly @vksmith i admit i would enjoy seeing this reblogged on brokelyn
768438288860471296 2016-08-24 13:22:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly @vksmith i like how he was arrested in GA for "driving under the influence and hijacking farm equipment" (at the same time?)
768438002674696192 2016-08-24 13:21:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly @tylercoates this is really bizarre
768314753399812096 2016-08-23 05:11:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @addysue of course he deleted all those tweets
768277788428079105 2016-08-23 02:44:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz also surprising lack of discretion from someone who used to flack for senior members of congress
768276695149273088 2016-08-23 02:40:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz really distasteful that he tweeted the reporter's private message to an employee
768260717690626048 2016-08-23 01:36:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BrooklynSpoke what makes you think the initial report isn't accurate? the wording that the child "darted out" into the street?
768236526337679360 2016-08-23 00:00:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jezebel @_grendan @_alexsommer haha yes that is the major underlying policy issue
768212407466463236 2016-08-23 22:24:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull @CarsonSieving its weird because the adhesive ones come in some fun patterns/colors but that gray is the ugliest/most common
768211977592340486 2016-08-23 22:23:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull @CarsonSieving it is the adhesive kind, much cheaper than real tile
768209452533153793 2016-08-23 22:13:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Calbanese literally every new rental I tour has these
768209351949553664 2016-08-23 22:12:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Calbanese I think that gray one might be a stick on one too, not even like real tile
768209250086715392 2016-08-23 22:12:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Calbanese seriously all the ugly shit you see thats ubiquitous here probably came from Home Depot. Esp ugly cabinets
768208961036226560 2016-08-23 22:11:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull its probably discounted at home depot
768208348537839616 2016-08-23 22:08:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> And the commenters are right, that backsplash is atrocious and i see it in like half the new buildings i tour
768207681362550784 2016-08-23 22:05:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka events, and dates if i'm really motivated
768207587238154240 2016-08-23 22:05:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> In case you missed @_grendan writing about real estate, he is still doing it over at Jezebel http://jezebel.com/the-new-york-times-real-estate-section-is-making-fun-of-1785656030

768200615147208705 2016-08-23 21:37:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> Pretty sure this project is as of right so I'm not sure what the pols think they can dohttps://twitter.com/BensonhurstBean/status/768200094264856576

768153273815662593 2016-08-23 18:29:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Saxonius it's the anniversary of the riots, which always inspires lots of hateful crap
768151751883124736 2016-08-23 18:23:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @SoBendito wouldn't kill them to put some better retail tenants in there and/or renovate that target either
768150852217495553 2016-08-23 18:20:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @SoBendito why
768150341590343680 2016-08-23 18:18:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @SoBendito i wonder if they will sell atlantic terminal mall
768150073331056644 2016-08-23 18:17:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday yes definitely go! food is great. and the owners had a family birthday last night and gave us free cake :D
768149899489796097 2016-08-23 18:16:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism what does this mean?
768148700652826624 2016-08-23 18:11:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> I don't venture over to Vanderbilt often, but I went to a place last night called Tin Kettle and it was pretty good https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150911/prospect-heights/southern-comfort-food-coming-vanderbilt-avenue-with-tin-kettle
768148003127496704 2016-08-23 18:08:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AnnaESanders i'm not even sure what he thinks of Cuomo
768147252225437696 2016-08-23 18:05:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AnnaESanders and he doesn't even address Cuomo! interesting. or does he later in the transcript?
768146243004559360 2016-08-23 18:01:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz white boy magic
768145483680325632 2016-08-23 17:58:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> "Explore alternatives" is vaguest possible way to talk about what you're doing with your property. Selling it? What? http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-22/forest-city-plans-to-explore-alternatives-for-retail-properties
768144740063862785 2016-08-23 17:55:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter and that floor is wood :-/
768144172851294208 2016-08-23 17:53:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter dang tho it looks like you basically step out of the bathtub and right into the kitchen table
768143781476663296 2016-08-23 17:52:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter I'd be down if it came with that nice mid-century modern furniture it's been staged with 
768143036564049920 2016-08-23 17:49:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter at least it's nicely renovated? also there's no way that's the tenant's real furniture
768142527811780608 2016-08-23 17:47:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner there are at least 10, but looks like more built-in book shelves in the hall closets
768142258289901568 2016-08-23 17:46:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> Might need to turn off that Crown Heights twitter filter for a while
768141921676066816 2016-08-23 17:44:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> Those bookshelves built into the (very deep) window frames are pretty coolpic.twitter.com/Qg1zZHDxDN
768141442942439424 2016-08-23 17:42:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> Listing says it's now "in contract" which means someone has submitted a rental app that's likely to be accepted http://www.stribling.com/properties/14805142
768139126646407168 2016-08-23 17:33:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @donewman @petersterne yeah if his creditors want their money now, renting it is much faster $$ than selling it
768138910782357504 2016-08-23 17:32:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> I was originally looking for this Gothamist post, which features a basement studio with a trash bag shower curtain http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/must_love_imagination.php
768138001503453184 2016-08-23 17:29:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Lo and behold, an "upscale" $1950-a-month Williamsburg shower kitchen apartment http://gothamist.com/2016/03/04/classy_kitchen_shower.phphttps://twitter.com/plitter/status/768136002548498432

768136452785995776 2016-08-23 17:22:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> I wonder what happens with this apartment now that he's filed for personal bankruptcy....
768136256324763649 2016-08-23 17:22:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter yeah def in lower manhattan
768135650809880577 2016-08-23 17:19:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter aha i just thought it was funny (and you're right!). i wanted you to be like "for this price, we expected a shower in the kitchen"
768135138878291968 2016-08-23 17:17:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> I like how @plitter says this $1000-a-month Harlem studio has a separate kitchen and bathroom like that's an amenity http://ny.curbed.com/2016/8/23/12608814/harlem-studio-for-rent-cheap
768133041793470464 2016-08-23 17:09:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> Nick Denton was asking $14K a month for his soho loft condo in July http://ny.curbed.com/2016/7/10/12139564/gawker-founder-nick-denton-nyc-soho-rental
768131969528000513 2016-08-23 17:05:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also just a good lil summary of where we are on this Cuomo 421-a plan, from @KonradPutzier http://therealdeal.com/2016/08/22/cuomos-421a-wage-subsidy-would-be-novelty-in-us/

768127486022541312 2016-08-23 16:47:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet the first one was from someone whose account is locked, so i will forgive you
768127086661959680 2016-08-23 16:45:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet might have to ban this joke from my mentions since you're the second one who's made it
768125213649371179 2016-08-23 16:38:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ no it's pronounced to rhyme with "bro" like "doe"

768113347858272256 2016-08-23 15:51:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alykatzz HPD is so non-transparent too, they must get so many FOIL requests annually
768109370978828289 2016-08-23 15:35:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @laura_nelson it's likely not him, but i know a street artist who does great stuff with trash/discarded thingshttp://www.franciscodepajaro.com/#!street-art/c2zv

767924515661905921 2016-08-22 03:20:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> It has certainly been a summer for Questioning Our Career Choices in Journalism
767920821679554560 2016-08-22 03:06:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak not sure I read that one, but maybe they are all blending together
767917384418099200 2016-08-22 02:52:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak I also enjoyed Foster Kamer's piece on Vox
767916979336478721 2016-08-22 02:50:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak I thought Choire's piece was very good also
767914612188672000 2016-08-22 02:41:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak really? Most of them seem pretty aware of exactly how that went down. Did you read Max Read's NY Mag piece?
767859682648162304 2016-08-22 23:03:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro not long ago i worked for a blog that still used "after the jump", but my first association with that is print
767856842554957824 2016-08-22 22:51:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism in any case, the docs will be out soon
767856750083072001 2016-08-22 22:51:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i went to that press conference and i get the impression it's both
767856514694582272 2016-08-22 22:50:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism they are planning an upzoning you know
767854779422937088 2016-08-22 22:43:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> TIL Tom Scocca worked at NYO back in the day http://observer.com/author/tom-scocca/
767842775551320064 2016-08-22 21:55:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Rochdalian i know there's stuff happening on Rogers south of EP, so hopefully we'll have some info about it over the next few years
767842502279884800 2016-08-22 21:54:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Rochdalian oh, that one is called Branch Ofc. totally forgot about the hardware store
767841262149959680 2016-08-22 21:49:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Rochdalian is it that bar called 99 Rogers?
767841160224239616 2016-08-22 21:49:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Rochdalian i've had a few other people tweet at me about this. i doubt it's being tracked since there isn't that much retail on Rogers
767835968279904260 2016-08-22 21:28:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade he's not even an economist, he's a poorly informed investment banker with bad opinions about housing policy

767831385436487681 2016-08-22 21:10:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @crassversion yeah i pointed that out later in the thread
767822592602411008 2016-08-22 20:35:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand ugghhhhgh
767821688964775936 2016-08-22 20:32:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand wow. but i would still have to put regular concealer on top of the peach corrector under my eyes, right?
767821063308840961 2016-08-22 20:29:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand no i think the peach will work fine for undereye, but i've had makeup people suggest the green corrector for my acne redness
767820253464322049 2016-08-22 20:26:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BobbiBrown @lemonsand ok, i will try!
767820199336771584 2016-08-22 20:26:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand AFAIK i need two different color correctors (peach and green) and i think the prospect stresses me out a bit
767818499355971584 2016-08-22 20:19:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SarahEvonne @lemonsand i think someone put it on me once but the blending seemed too complex for me
767818112259526656 2016-08-22 20:17:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SarahEvonne @lemonsand i have extremely large, dark circles under my eyes so my concealer struggle is never ending
767817404126785537 2016-08-22 20:15:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SarahEvonne @lemonsand i have seen their ads for concealer and i am much more interested in that for quality/efficacy. have you tried?

767786212354588673 2016-08-22 18:11:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandakhurley @MsShade this sounds like a good baffler piece
767785924906319872 2016-08-22 18:10:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade i grew up in the DC suburbs so i have many feelings on this subject lol
767785197941260289 2016-08-22 18:07:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ she said she "did it all the time" and i was like oooook
767785136419139584 2016-08-22 18:06:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ i guess so
767785021570678784 2016-08-22 18:06:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade hm true. the rich white people just lived in 'burbs and like northwest, now they live everywhere except deep NE and anacostia
767784163168616449 2016-08-22 18:03:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade i guess more importantly, when was it not bad
767783939780009988 2016-08-22 18:02:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade i have felt this way for eight years and tbh kind of my whole life, join the club
767783746225442817 2016-08-22 18:01:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> *but, oops
767768494729551874 2016-08-22 17:00:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> i don't put this makes me feel like i should
767764128526131200 2016-08-22 16:43:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik lol hard to say
767763614174420992 2016-08-22 16:41:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i've had brokers tell me this on multiple occasions
767761926323572736 2016-08-22 16:34:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner i could smell it burning, which is why i told her to take it out
767760312166707200 2016-08-22 16:28:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> I thought don't-put-flammable-stuff-in-the-oven was a pretty intuitive concept
767760158835572740 2016-08-22 16:27:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner she seemed surprised by the concept that the box could burst into flames while she was trying to reheat the pizza
767759707037630464 2016-08-22 16:25:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik when you call the broker and they tell you it was "previously occupied by a hoarder"
767758872316616704 2016-08-22 16:22:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik yes, nostrand is a major retail corridor, so i would think so
767758775541460993 2016-08-22 16:22:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just had to explain to my roommate why she can't put pizza boxes in the oven....
767757923502161921 2016-08-22 16:18:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i'm not saying it can't happen; i just think the data isn't there bc not much has happened yet
767757118548111361 2016-08-22 16:15:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik but yeah flatbush ave, etc
767757038084554752 2016-08-22 16:15:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik mmmm i doubt anyone is tracking rogers because there isn't that much retail
767753339283136513 2016-08-22 16:00:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's also pretty boring just to talk about the hood as if Franklin Avenue is the whole thing...
767752789665669120 2016-08-22 15:58:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CompStak @MarketUrbanism ok thanks
767752717368459265 2016-08-22 15:58:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Since Franklin is completely "retail gentrified" and Nostrand is only partially so....
767752453278339074 2016-08-22 15:57:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> Can someone doing a real estate trend piece about Crown Heights compare the retail rents on Franklin and Nostrand? I would be interested
767751689868902404 2016-08-22 15:54:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin i also find this whole "don't drink or you'll be sexually assaulted" narrative very problematic...
767751424381976576 2016-08-22 15:52:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin hm true but i guess if the options are calling the college or harass your kid constantly, better the former.
767750445028745220 2016-08-22 15:49:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alanalevinson ok, this was a tweet worth RTing

767741187629408256 2016-08-22 15:12:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito i can cut them some slack for not wanting to incorporate the concept of blocks and lot numbers for the TV watching audience
767740987477200898 2016-08-22 15:11:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito ha oh true he did

767738185833218048 2016-08-22 15:00:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rabonour he ignores a lot of things

766744488521924608 2016-08-19 21:11:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism not that I know of, and the city has been pretty light on details
766744092357386240 2016-08-19 21:10:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism I think it was if they had financing for such a big office tower

766743271968301056 2016-08-19 21:06:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> Of course we don't know if office tower will happen either! But the dev paid the city $15 million for those air rights & some property...
766743021803241476 2016-08-19 21:05:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> I guess it is good that the developer of a 400K sf office tower next door helped indirectly make this happen http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/11/downtown-brooklyn-is-finally-getting-a-new-office-building-at-420-albee-square.html
766742636917030912 2016-08-19 21:04:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you're wondering why this is happening now after 3 years, it's because the dev of 420 Albee paid $15 million for the park's air rights
766742486421299201 2016-08-19 21:03:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> Or at least the building on the site is being demo'd. The city couldn't give me an expected completion date for the park, Willoughby Square

766689089269538816 2016-08-19 17:31:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ it's a thing that's been going for years and it's very contentious, but bc people there oppose it i'm not sure it'll ever happen
766688941995098112 2016-08-19 17:31:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ lol yeah
766687868119048193 2016-08-19 17:26:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ though this section - which connects to the A train tracks - probably has some of the best potential to become a park
766687171801706497 2016-08-19 17:24:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ many people want it as a park but it goes right up next to people's houses and also once it's a park it can never be rail again
766686969917210624 2016-08-19 17:23:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ yes, it's the abandoned rockaway beach branch of LIRR. it's quite long actually. http://gothamist.com/2014/10/15/queens_high_line_nope.php http://thequeensway.org/the-plan/plan-overview/

766685518440660992 2016-08-19 17:17:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ it's not a park yet and it may never be

766304875336572928 2016-08-18 16:04:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism are you saying that contractors will essentially keep part/all of the subsidy for themselves?
766304275333050368 2016-08-18 16:02:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy i was talking to a union organizer the other night who told me that he knew cuomo just embraced unions to fuck with the mayor
766304070403579905 2016-08-18 16:01:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy ugh
766301856507260928 2016-08-18 15:52:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy and if you yank out 421-a and J-51 without fixing the way large rental buildings are assessed, it will only exacerbate problems
766301685534826496 2016-08-18 15:52:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy that's accurate. my original point was that our property tax system is already set up to punish the poor
766301500301799425 2016-08-18 15:51:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy i'm not sure what you're asking
766301302439735296 2016-08-18 15:50:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy those towers received 421-a abatements because of corruption, and that's why some of the legislators involved are now on trial
766301084528828416 2016-08-18 15:49:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy well civil forfeiture is a totally different discussion than 421-a and obviously it's heavily abused by NYPD
766300842605604864 2016-08-18 15:48:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy the existing laws don't do much and were structured for when NYC was economically depressed in the 70s
766300526631870464 2016-08-18 15:47:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy otherwise, you (1) destroy development in the areas that need it most and (2) punish tenants who will end up paying more
766300356519264256 2016-08-18 15:46:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy well unfortunately 421-a is propping up our deeply flawed tax system. unless it's fixed, we need stuff like this
766299612005171200 2016-08-18 15:43:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy yeah the wage subsidy thing seems... problematic
766299524264583168 2016-08-18 15:43:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy are you talking about the wage subsidies?
766298976689672192 2016-08-18 15:41:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy that's a pretty poor representation of what 421-a does
766298817721470977 2016-08-18 15:40:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism why would it become that much more common than it is now

765986840688070656 2016-08-17 19:01:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik right, because a lot of those buildings' rooftops are no longer in use, usually because they put mechanicals there
765986003505049600 2016-08-17 18:57:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik have to put the mechanicals for your AC and elevators somewhere I guess
765983986845945856 2016-08-17 18:49:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik I feel like the takeaways here are (1) farm animals on the roof and (2) sex clubs in the basement
765976735322140672 2016-08-17 18:20:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2300MEL it's a legendary thing, yeah i've heard about it
765975103549083648 2016-08-17 18:14:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @joshmorrissey i will try to find it!
765974546046386176 2016-08-17 18:12:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> There is apparently an '86 NYDN article by Bob Kappstatter on how the city shut down Plato's Retreat; i need to track it down sometime
765973438943100928 2016-08-17 18:07:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @derektmead is it?? i have never heard of the bath house or Plato's Retreat but i am so interested
765972919575076864 2016-08-17 18:05:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just another day in real estate reporting and researching the Upper West Side https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ansoniapic.twitter.com/jIREKCSCDO
765967398545584128 2016-08-17 17:43:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> I wasn't on twitter this morning and I'm baffled that Trumpbart is real https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/trumpbart?utm_term=.rexA0m93p#.waDWQ35NA
765966651573596160 2016-08-17 17:40:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_grendan i haven't seen the latest one but now i'm excited
765949439433404417 2016-08-17 16:32:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @myhairisblue @helfitzgerald omg helena i forgot you are insanely tall!! so jealous
765939027270856704 2016-08-17 15:51:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar @ChristRobbins this is not as bad as van bramer killing 100% affordable mid-rise in sunnyside but it's not great
765938740913119232 2016-08-17 15:50:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar @ChristRobbins maddening to kill a whole project because of a protest and not getting some concessions...
765938084286521344 2016-08-17 15:47:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar @ChristRobbins also some of the activists fighting this building seem confused about how MIH works and are freaking people out
765937877247295488 2016-08-17 15:46:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax hm ok; i would be interested in more about this
765937451936444420 2016-08-17 15:44:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar @ChristRobbins plus if 421-a came back by the time they break ground, market-rate units would also be stabilized for a while
765937046535991296 2016-08-17 15:43:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar @ChristRobbins but 200 market-rate units is a loss compared to 178 affordable ones, 71 of which would have been for 30K/yr
765934580138438656 2016-08-17 15:33:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> Dang @hhavrilesky is so good! http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/08/ask-polly-am-i-too-uptight.html

765922615101911040 2016-08-17 14:45:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade i guess it was purchased by an indian chemical company in '06 and shuttered, apparently was several acres w/ many bldgs
765921265941114880 2016-08-17 14:40:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade also i thought this place had been torn down? i guess only part of it
765920632928346112 2016-08-17 14:38:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade is this abandoned
765919076896083968 2016-08-17 14:31:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> TRD says 40 out of 100 shops at the Oculus/WTC mall haven't opened yet, even tho the mall opened yesterdayhttp://therealdeal.com/2016/08/16/westfield-opens-wtc-mall-but-closed-storefronts-abound/

765773476682752002 2016-08-16 04:53:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JoeTacopino I just wrote about the project where Oddo named the streets for greed and I thought it was pretty great
765773145852772352 2016-08-16 04:52:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JoeTacopino I often find it hilarious
765770884414078976 2016-08-16 04:43:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JoeTacopino I love local Staten Island news
765720109453348864 2016-08-16 01:21:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AFeinDude I have so many major ones!
765705410552664064 2016-08-16 00:22:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sandypsj just throwing that out there, i haven't read the piece and probably won't
765705343380951041 2016-08-16 00:22:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sandypsj we already have affordable housing for artists
765701117607026689 2016-08-16 00:05:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> At least there was a shoutout to Stay High 149
765700856205500417 2016-08-16 00:04:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @DaveCoIon and that is probably the least of this show's problems...
765700402234925056 2016-08-16 00:02:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @DaveCoIon sadly a lot of this show looks like that.. like they edited in some shitty burned out buildings into the background
765700091151777792 2016-08-16 00:01:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @DaveCoIon it's based on archival 70s footage of the South Bronx but they did a shitty job
765699836922458112 2016-08-16 00:00:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @DaveCoIon Netflix spent $120 million on this!!
765699776088342528 2016-08-16 00:00:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ it's the Get Down, a new show on Netflix

765680164802101248 2016-08-16 22:42:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull and men are often unable to reconcile the effects of a sexual assault with their concept of what a "normal sex life" should be

765656958905049088 2016-08-16 21:10:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism well based on what they have already released, it will be standard MIH 20-30%
765656205763239937 2016-08-16 21:07:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i think it will still happen in some form
765655994093502468 2016-08-16 21:06:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2300MEL well maybe not after all
765655753105571840 2016-08-16 21:05:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism if they are expecting a scoping doc in the next few weeks, clearly DCP is already working on it

765649552422629377 2016-08-16 20:40:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull i think once you're in an established relationship it doesn't matter, but yeah probably a year or less it's a conversation

765598788316762114 2016-08-16 17:19:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik he grew up there so to him it's just flatbush, none of these other names really make sense to him i guess
765598489044660224 2016-08-16 17:17:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner newkirk plaza is still flatbush and hopefully always will be
765598140900728832 2016-08-16 17:16:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik could be
765598049385275393 2016-08-16 17:16:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik this is argyle between church and albemarle, where the single-fam deed restrictions were/are definitely in effect
765596814099771392 2016-08-16 17:11:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> He also lives in one of the huge landmarked houses on Argyle Road, and it's one of the few that is a two-family

765595780598104064 2016-08-16 17:07:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> I recently met someone from Ditmas Park who refuses to call it anything but Flatbush
765595684573704193 2016-08-16 17:06:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik he also said he refuses to call it ditmas park
765595180212842496 2016-08-16 17:04:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik that's sad
765594948213235713 2016-08-16 17:03:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik he suspects it was illegally converted like ~50 years ago since every other house on the block is single-fam/deed restrictions
765594465067266048 2016-08-16 17:01:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @eliotwb @NickTimiraos @MarketUrbanism hard disagree
765593880196775937 2016-08-16 16:59:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik met someone last night who lives in one of those huge houses on argyle road in ditmas but it's a two-fam

765214864243560453 2016-08-15 15:53:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rmc031 ... and the fact the organizers have been trying to unionize fast food workers (with SEIU) and haven't been able to
765214717556252672 2016-08-15 15:53:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rmc031 right. i guess i'm confusing the two issues here... the organizers wanting to be recognized as a union...

764117815095857152 2016-08-12 15:14:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also just funny to see the words "gentleman caller" and "fuck" in the same TNY piece, since I didn't even know TNY printed swear words
764115295334170624 2016-08-12 15:04:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> This lady deserves an award: Not today! Not this bitch! You picked the wrong woman to fuck with today! http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-crotchgrabber

764114397610598400 2016-08-12 15:00:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @danielleiat did you guys read the TNY thing about the woman who chased down a guy who like assaulted her in the street?

763784234884538369 2016-08-11 17:08:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman largely though not exclusively women writers too, a la the "pink ghetto" of personal essay writing
763783991937884160 2016-08-11 17:07:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @The_Analyst some of the brokers in my TL try to step up and argue when i tweet stuff like that but idc lol
763783840951332864 2016-08-11 17:07:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman glad i recently unfollowed him
763783546930655232 2016-08-11 17:06:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @The_Analyst i used to write up listings allllll the time at my last job and like 70% of them just filled me with inexplicable rage
763783328491241473 2016-08-11 17:05:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @The_Analyst that would honestly be better. whenever i see "parisian" in a New York City listing i want to throw my laptop across the room

763769014430601217 2016-08-11 16:08:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> Hi guys! @EmilyNonko is looking for people who have good stories about noise in old or new buildings. DM or email her emilynonko@gmail.com!
763762503386038272 2016-08-11 15:42:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie jared kushner and the dursts basically are the illuminati tbh
763761226627313664 2016-08-11 15:37:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn ha you nailed it, yes, i think this was one of moses' talking points
763760858686193665 2016-08-11 15:35:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie hm i dont think that's novel, at least not in new york
763760131561689089 2016-08-11 15:32:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urban_loudmouth eh i guess, i think that's mostly boring sensationalism from brokers talking to the press
763758946490413056 2016-08-11 15:28:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn which anti gentrification activists would hate but it would be financially sustainable and create aff home ownership here
763758774565888000 2016-08-11 15:27:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn we'll see. i would like to see maybe 60/40 market-rate to affordable condos, and have the affordable end be 40-60 AMI
763757847872143360 2016-08-11 15:23:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn it really depends. i think city would want some higher AMI apts since CH can command it, could subsidize low income units
763756863179595777 2016-08-11 15:20:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urban_loudmouth there are a ton. i rounded them up about a year ago http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/07/tracking-affordable-housing-and-rezonings-in-crown-heights.html this'll be huge too http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/08/crown-heights-laundry-at-902-franklin-avenue-nearly-demolished-for-four-building-residential-project.html
763755421546975232 2016-08-11 15:14:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito well that's kind of encouraging. maybe they were the runner up in the original RFP. but the armory is much more complex
763754544450924545 2016-08-11 15:10:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urban_loudmouth i deal with dudes "well actually"ing me on twitter (and real life) all day who don't know as much as i do. gets tiring!
763754196030152704 2016-08-11 15:09:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito could they? has that happened in a major city-driven redevelopment before? usually they have to start all over
763753610547191812 2016-08-11 15:07:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urban_loudmouth would you like to tell me more about my beat in my own hood? learn the local politics; it's rarely that black & white
763752776027561985 2016-08-11 15:03:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urban_loudmouth in any case, i don't think they would oppose it if it were public housing
763752594896551936 2016-08-11 15:03:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urban_loudmouth city would never build public housing here when they can command $$ rents and condo prices, so it's a moot point
763752341170483201 2016-08-11 15:02:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito yes but otherwise it will probably go forward pretty much as is, unless it gets killed entirely by this debacle
763752192159412224 2016-08-11 15:01:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito they are co-developing with BFC. I doubt they can do it alone so they might have to do the RFP all over again to find a new dev
763751044048384000 2016-08-11 14:56:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urban_loudmouth it would not be public housing
763750755379675140 2016-08-11 14:55:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Neither @rachelholliday or @RosaGoldensohn includes comment from EDC, who are probably waiting to see what City Hall does
763750246644088832 2016-08-11 14:53:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urban_loudmouth the anti-gentrification activists will oppose any major redevelopment of this property
763750117480493057 2016-08-11 14:53:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @urban_loudmouth i live here so i know a number of folks in the community do support it
763749550377033729 2016-08-11 14:50:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Bill de Blasio seriously considering killing Slate's deal for the Bedford Union Armory bc of Rivington House scandal https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160810/crown-heights/activists-target-shady-developer-of-bedford-union-armory
763749088538005504 2016-08-11 14:49:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alanalevinson @caleweissman apparently the original post had names and detailed descriptions of folks' profiles too... sigh
763748966932635652 2016-08-11 14:48:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alanalevinson @caleweissman i mean the editor's note at the bottom makes it less horrible but still...
763743648727109632 2016-08-11 14:27:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> Besides the blatant ethics issues at play, it's not super compelling content to begin with...
763742581532524544 2016-08-11 14:23:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> Can we just kill this bizarre genre of posts about cruising for dates on tinder/grindr/etc at major news events right now?
763742320177057792 2016-08-11 14:22:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @joelcifer there is also now a pretty long editor's note at the bottom
763741517429235713 2016-08-11 14:19:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @maggieserota @plitter is he selling a condo or something
763741190105751553 2016-08-11 14:17:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BroderickGreer @joelcifer i think it was removed and reposted? time stamp is also different now
763740816665878528 2016-08-11 14:16:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BroderickGreer @joelcifer really? oh thats much worse. also headline is different now
763589269575401472 2016-08-10 04:14:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader yes! I actually ran into Andy Hawkins while he was working on a draft of that last week, cool stuff - transpo, trespassing, etc
763507244419997696 2016-08-10 22:48:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CahnEmily eh disturbed seems like a strong word
763488593121804292 2016-08-10 21:34:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 lol that too
763487785936445440 2016-08-10 21:30:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 honestly unless he goes in the building, i doubt they don't even have charges strong enough to put him in jail

763117212844560385 2016-08-09 20:58:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ but yes they have been writing about it
763116997857148928 2016-08-09 20:57:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ idk what you mean by pop journalists, but content is content
763116026594729986 2016-08-09 20:53:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schnell_j just funny bc there are a number of sports where height is pretty irrelevant, and fencing is one of them!
763115901323444224 2016-08-09 20:53:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schnell_j unless you're a coxswain, where being little is an advantage
763114288311566337 2016-08-09 20:46:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schnell_j I'm literally too short for everything lol

763113249072156673 2016-08-09 20:42:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> One of the littlest women's foilists I've ever fenced is also one of the best, and she's shorter than I am http://www.usfencing.org/page/show/717801-margaret-lu
763111371139604480 2016-08-09 20:35:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> It also matters little in saber. Epee is the only one that trends very tall and reach can make a huge difference
763111187349372929 2016-08-09 20:34:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> I wish they had included the other weapons, but actually foil is a weapon where your height matters littlepic.twitter.com/PUWfWYGKK0
763108995360026624 2016-08-09 20:25:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> That Trump lawn sign should be considered a hate crime all on its own
763107565316308993 2016-08-09 20:19:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak this is very weird
763107084636413952 2016-08-09 20:18:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak is that like speed walking
763106639163617280 2016-08-09 20:16:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm looking at you, people writing about gymnastics and swimming (and sometimes fencing!)

763102509028241408 2016-08-09 19:59:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Only a few days into Olympics & I'm already tired of hot takes published by people who know nothing about the sports they're writing about
763095744261783552 2016-08-09 19:32:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Is there any way to circumvent this annoying login thing for the Olympics?
763094826426437632 2016-08-09 19:29:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> also epee has a rep for being v slow-moving and i've known epeeists who nap between bouts, so there are other reasons it's funny...
763094038832615424 2016-08-09 19:26:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> ha yes, it is a funny word. it's weird bc almost everything in fencing is french, except for a few terms borrowed from italian
763092444514779136 2016-08-09 19:19:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also our one men's epeeist competing today lost in the round of 32 :(
763091618673094657 2016-08-09 19:16:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also if they were not in such close range and infighting rather sloppily it probably wouldn't have fallen out...
763090909021999104 2016-08-09 19:13:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> In his defense, there is a lot of standing around in between bouts and it's easier to keep stuff with youhttps://twitter.com/selectall/status/763090480968204288

763020677746159617 2016-08-09 14:34:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar the one encouraging precedent is that the affordable housing that's already been built next door is pretty nice looking

763015158037901314 2016-08-09 14:12:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ probably mini-splits since those are cheaper/more energy efficient than central air
763015009098145793 2016-08-09 14:12:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ no idea! could be. i see big condenser units on the ground floor, might be ERVs and/or mini-splits

763009129300492288 2016-08-09 13:48:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ that being said, the newish affordable housing they built next door is nice-looking http://www.brownstoner.com/real-estate-market/affordable-housing-development-finished-at-our-lady-of-loreto-site-in-brownsville/
763008604530155520 2016-08-09 13:46:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Love to read architects talking shit about each other's designs in the comments
763008500964483076 2016-08-09 13:46:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ for affordable and low income, it's unlikely. generally only do large scale preservation when you can make money on a project
763008294671773697 2016-08-09 13:45:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka yeah i know but still, it's clearly written with a specific employer perspective in mind that seems outdated
763007613525168128 2016-08-09 13:42:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka ... so that it only costs them a fraction of the person's salary when it does come time to replace them
763007520352894976 2016-08-09 13:42:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka it seems weird to read a study about this that doesn't acknowledge how majority of employers treat millennials as disposable...

762862939804053504 2016-08-08 04:07:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> I had to explain that people don't just get plucked off the streets of heavily populated neighborhoods and get murdered while running

762738762493358080 2016-08-08 19:54:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katieraffa if you can charge upwards of a million for a house that looks like it was originally affordable housing, i guess so!!!
762738656356495365 2016-08-08 19:54:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katieraffa so i think there was a desire for crown heights folks to separate themselves from that area as well
762738542573449216 2016-08-08 19:53:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katieraffa and much more realistically, the part of CH/Ocean Hill close to brownsville is desolate, poor, was formerly a housing project
762738237530116100 2016-08-08 19:52:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katieraffa because Ocean Hill was/is part of same school district with brownsville, they were grouped together as Ocean Hill-Brownsville
762738070840078337 2016-08-08 19:51:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katieraffa many people who have lived in the neighborhood a long time consider Howard the boundary, with the area to the east "Ocean Hill"
762737215449534465 2016-08-08 19:48:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is really Ocean Hill, fwiw
762737176224395264 2016-08-08 19:48:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel lol which part
762736892601331712 2016-08-08 19:47:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> Smart brokers repping houses east of Utica at least try to go for historic neighborhood names, like Weeksville or Ocean Hill
762735669038948352 2016-08-08 19:42:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon more like 20 minutes of waiting for the C train
762735506593546240 2016-08-08 19:41:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon lol i didn't even read that far into the listing but they are always saying that, no matter where it is
762734224004833280 2016-08-08 19:36:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @K_Liakos actually someone is building a new one up the street from me in crown heights
762734147219652608 2016-08-08 19:36:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @K_Liakos i'm sure their new office is in bed stuy now
762733488336412672 2016-08-08 19:33:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> At some point you might have to admit this property is spitting distance from Brownsville
762733317397569536 2016-08-08 19:32:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon this is still happening?
762733142256062464 2016-08-08 19:32:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> But of course then you might have to *drop the price*
762733084366233604 2016-08-08 19:31:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> I hate to break it to these brokers but this $875K townhouse is so far east it barely qualifies as Crown Heights http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/3709967

762725571541471233 2016-08-08 19:02:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> yeah i've walked across it before at night but i guess that's a little trespass-y
762724605786198021 2016-08-08 18:58:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen true!! i know BdB promised to fast track the rest of the Build it Back money but idk if that really happened
762723738634911744 2016-08-08 18:54:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> i think they have never done it bc DOT has a little garage right there and sometimes drives up and down it? so weird
762723351194398724 2016-08-08 18:53:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito or maybe while you're recreating it :D
762723147653283840 2016-08-08 18:52:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> shameful that the awkward little car lane has never been turned into a pedestrian one
762722154848849920 2016-08-08 18:48:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen elaborate?
762720093730209792 2016-08-08 18:40:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito welp time for a drink
762690316289835008 2016-08-08 16:41:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism this tweet almost sounds like you are worried about a dearth of parking but i know that's not what you mean
762688560743014400 2016-08-08 16:34:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> "Dear DCP, please let us build extra parking spots because otherwise we can't sell these expensive condos"
762687615904743424 2016-08-08 16:31:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> A developer in Chelsea wants to build extra parking spaces, because condos
762684893226729472 2016-08-08 16:20:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL @rolandlisf yeah. from city perspective, question is should you use low income funding here or someplace where it'd go furhter
762684161077415937 2016-08-08 16:17:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL @rolandlisf i mean we have set asides for locals but yeah anyone with NYC residence can apply
762683536121991168 2016-08-08 16:14:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> Expanding the pedestrian and bike lanes on the Brooklyn Bridge (maybe!!) http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/nyregion/brooklyn-bridge-expansion.html?mtrref=t.co
762681713231290369 2016-08-08 16:07:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL literally one step away from writing a piece about how cuomo is killing economic dev in the outer boros with his petty garbage
762680431619833856 2016-08-08 16:02:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL not gonna be any construction in most of the bronx without it, affordable or not....
762679885131292674 2016-08-08 16:00:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL yeah this was pretty dumb but actually i'm wondering if most of these towers will get killed bc we won't have 421-a for a year
762679296720764929 2016-08-08 15:58:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL i find it frustrating bc East New York got soooooo much press because "gentrification" but no one cares about the Bronx or SI
762678865575743488 2016-08-08 15:56:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL that one will be a pivotal rezoning but no one pays attention because it's the bronx. hopefully something happens soon
762678610943696896 2016-08-08 15:55:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL his lack of interest in building for poor hoods is probably why the Jerome Ave rezoning isn't moving, but could be other reasons
762678490516905984 2016-08-08 15:54:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL yeah it's a rising tide floats all boats mentality, trying to bring middle-class back to the bronx, focus on malls, golf courses
762677904392220672 2016-08-08 15:52:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL he's a bit more upfront about it than the Bronx beep, who is pretty pro-dev but won't admit it when speaking to poor hoods
762677505878810625 2016-08-08 15:51:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL he is pro-development and he's not going to pretend different; to me the tweet says he wants to build affordable hsg
762676865500864513 2016-08-08 15:48:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL they lowered some of the "average" AMIs in the final version of MIH and Ydanis could potentially push them for lower ones
762667296179515392 2016-08-08 15:10:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> John Oliver is just so good, so worth watching on the state of journalism https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq2_wSsDwkQ
762666629775884288 2016-08-08 15:07:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> Zoning board hearing!!
762666572838207488 2016-08-08 15:07:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> "The day I run into HuffPo reporter @ Baltimore zoning board hearing...I'll be confident we've reached some kind of equilibrium"-@AoDespair
762664769161682945 2016-08-08 15:00:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> So cool to see John Oliver do a segment on the importance of local journalism
762659357687447552 2016-08-08 14:38:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> yay!! good luck with the new place, excited for you guys
762658987607228416 2016-08-08 14:37:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> did you guys finally move???
762658950181421056 2016-08-08 14:37:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> lol two days later
762658530935570433 2016-08-08 14:35:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Russ_Steinberg It's not working! i gave up and i'll just watch it later (it's fencing so they only have one event per day)
762657789261021184 2016-08-08 14:32:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> The fact that I can't login to watch the Olympics probably means I should be working instead
762656108788015104 2016-08-08 14:26:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL time to get your own bike
762654985888956416 2016-08-08 14:21:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull :-/
762654560964018176 2016-08-08 14:19:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Russ_Steinberg oh now they are forcing me to log in :-/
762654383024857088 2016-08-08 14:19:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull is it really that dire?
762654260513402880 2016-08-08 14:18:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Watched one of my fav ladies saberists lose to a Greek girl but Ibtihaj won!
762651753871441920 2016-08-08 14:08:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> Saber is fun to watch because it's one of the only events where refs are occasionally swayed by the ferocity of people's screaming
762650614920781826 2016-08-08 14:04:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Russ_Steinberg I haven't had to login yet and maybe that's why my livestream is super annoying? idk how it works
762649976853987328 2016-08-08 14:01:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa if you scream louder sometimes the ref will give you the point, lol
762648522823000064 2016-08-08 13:55:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa they scream more than pretty much anyone else!
762644544336883712 2016-08-08 13:40:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> I imagine Hillary Clinton eating salads and angrily looking at these Trump fast food photos http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/donald-trump-diet.html?mtrref=t.co&_r=0
762638988528218112 2016-08-08 13:17:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> Kind of obnoxious that they call fencers up to the strip & make them stand around on camera while the other simultaneous bouts are announced
762636795116920832 2016-08-08 13:09:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just watched Mariel Zagunis destroy some Panamanian girl in her first bout
762512319826030592 2016-08-07 04:54:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull I fenced for a long time and I watched people get badly injured when weapons broke mid-bout, even tho you wear a lot of clothing
762510926385782784 2016-08-07 04:49:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pauldebenedetto also loved Winona and the sheriff
762504431392788480 2016-08-07 04:23:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dstfelix i know you're talking about gymnastics but i'm also excited to see black women's fencers at the olympics!
762502123342880768 2016-08-07 04:14:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pauldebenedetto like a lot of the south, i'm sure the district level results will be worth watching
762500236669390851 2016-08-07 04:06:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pauldebenedetto i was kind of surprised when VA went purple-blue but i just don't see it happening in texas
762495680153739265 2016-08-07 03:48:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> I don't know if everyone realizes how exciting it is to finally be able to watch a sport that usually got aired at 3 a.m.
762482858854264833 2016-08-07 02:57:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also the eletrified bibs are weird but I guess the fact that I find it odd shows how long I've been away from fencing
762482408742465537 2016-08-07 02:55:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm glad they got rid of the masks with the windows in them because seeing people's facial expressions is weird
762480523633496064 2016-08-07 02:48:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kmonson i meant an individual event, but they did a great job!
762480205470371842 2016-08-07 02:47:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ having stuff on your mask isn't unusual but they used to not allow it
762479368606064640 2016-08-07 02:43:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's extremely weird that the Olympic fencers have lights in their helmets but I'm sure it makes the bouts more spectator friendly
762477153627758593 2016-08-07 02:34:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> Westbrook started a foundation to recruit & train black, inner city fencers here in New York. Many of his students are now at the Olympics!
762476867127422977 2016-08-07 02:33:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> And we haven't medaled in men's foil in 50 years!!
762476687753744390 2016-08-07 02:33:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> The last time an American male fencer medaled was Peter Westbrook, who won a bronze in saber back in '84
762476383046029312 2016-08-07 02:31:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also foilist Alex Massialas won the silver today, which is the first time in decades a U.S. mens fencer has medaledhttp://www.nbcolympics.com/news/team-usa-fencer-alexander-massialas-wins-silver
762474637712248837 2016-08-07 02:24:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ clearly i am not a morning person. i woke up at 5 am on saturday and now i am paying the price lol
762474434087178241 2016-08-07 02:24:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ at first i thought it was 8 since that's when the tournament starts, but she is byed into the round of 32
762473955542175744 2016-08-07 02:22:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ 9 am (a time i am a bit skeptical of, since I doubt even the IOC can run fencing tournaments on schedule)
762473212894515200 2016-08-07 02:19:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Gonna have to start watching ladies saber bright and early tomorrow to see Ibtihaj Muhammad  fence in the round of 32
762372098991988736 2016-08-07 19:37:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> Honestly violence might be justified
762370969977622528 2016-08-07 19:32:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> There should be serious consequences for stealing someone's dryer at the laundromat on Sundays
762361042106212352 2016-08-07 18:53:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad 18?
762348283637399552 2016-08-07 18:02:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Sounds like an SROhttps://twitter.com/CurbedNY/status/762347678638280704
762314667943464960 2016-08-07 15:49:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Scary stuff in Seattle from @sydbrownstone http://www.thestranger.com/features/2016/08/10/24435013/at-least-10-people-say-theyve-been-drugged-at-seattle-bars-this-summer
762310687540609024 2016-08-07 15:33:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> Lol http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-happened-after-i-wrote-that-cargo-shorts-story-1470402723
762310469881323520 2016-08-07 15:32:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito maybe he's the dog walker? I assume there was a dog present with them
762307898269659137 2016-08-07 15:22:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito but who was he talking to??
762307728790257666 2016-08-07 15:21:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> literally found this by googling the quote "I think we may have reached peak crystal" http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/fashion/olympic-gymnastics-simone-biles-leotards-crystals.html
762306591681110016 2016-08-07 15:17:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> the times style section just did a bizarre but interesting feature on how their leotards are encrusted with Swarovski crystals
762306370737668096 2016-08-07 15:16:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> they use that hairspray kind of stuff to keep their leotards from riding up their butts! I'm sure they have makeup secrets
762111038674333696 2016-08-06 02:20:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Learning to block the garbage people in your life is so freeing
762101611036540928 2016-08-06 01:42:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamiekeiles write a short story about some of these
762101558758797313 2016-08-06 01:42:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamiekeiles morgue transport!
762065110160539649 2016-08-06 23:17:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman tbh i am much more annoyed about the times cutting its metro beat reporting! that's the outrage of today really
762064556948615168 2016-08-06 23:15:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman i mean i guess it's cheap but is it really worth it? eps if you don't live in the slope? extremely divided views out there
762064303692386305 2016-08-06 23:14:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman i know you were joking. i just never really got into it in depth before but people in the Slope all feel some kinda way
762063169238032384 2016-08-06 23:09:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman i just don't live among the rich white people of park slope, ok? geez
762054364773117952 2016-08-06 22:34:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> I wasn't prepared for the beef this food co-op tweet has generated
762047798263111680 2016-08-06 22:08:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @foldedsunset is it really so much cheaper than every other grocery store that it's worth that kind of time?
762047564262825984 2016-08-06 22:07:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader @BradyDale lainna i would see this with you, as long as i am still awake then
762046712508719104 2016-08-06 22:04:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PatrickCoffee ha sounds about right
762046495889690625 2016-08-06 22:03:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @foldedsunset crazy. i mean it makes sense maybe if you work in the hood (maybe a lot of those people work at the hospital?)
762045562384515072 2016-08-06 21:59:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TheDustyRebel this sounds pretty weird even by park slope standards
762045370381787136 2016-08-06 21:59:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PatrickCoffee getting paid to drink and write about it is pretty fancy anyway!
762039972446736384 2016-08-06 21:37:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade they have these at Green-Wood too
762038775061110784 2016-08-06 21:32:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PatrickCoffee lounge lizard doesn't sound like a real job
762038552880381952 2016-08-06 21:32:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TheDustyRebel people get walked home?
762038145412108289 2016-08-06 21:30:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TheDustyRebel so you are a member! Lol
762036114676940800 2016-08-06 21:22:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> cc @amandamull
762026966186921989 2016-08-06 20:46:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katieraffa yeah that's in Bed Stuy right? I might. Would rather join a CSA here tbh
762026816982937601 2016-08-06 20:45:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> When I told him that it wasn't worth it to go to Park Slope to grocery shop bc I live here, he told me "oh no it's worth it" 
762026134330609665 2016-08-06 20:42:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> I was grocery shopping in Crown Heights and a random white man informed me it would be cheaper if I went to the Park Slope Food Coop. Um?
762025251794550784 2016-08-06 20:39:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katieraffa I'm in Crown Heights, so idk!
762021296867803136 2016-08-06 20:23:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> Wonder what the Richmond County EMTs are doing in my local Bagel Pub

762013793950003200 2016-08-06 19:53:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin @chayesmatthew time to go burn something down in Brooklyn Heights
762013115752022016 2016-08-06 19:50:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> what's driving it is that the Times wants to better monetize its content so more people will read the metro section
762012483817185280 2016-08-06 19:48:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> DNAinfo has like 1/100th of the resources of the Times and most of their beat reporters are overworked for this reason
762012045697048577 2016-08-06 19:46:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> that's probably their rationale but that's not true. The Times' retreat from beat reporting has left a hole that will get bigger
762009772153511936 2016-08-06 19:37:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> People are protesting the proposed 23-story building in Inwood/Washington Heights http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/01/first-look-4650-broadway-23-story-apartment-building-in-washington-heights.htmlpic.twitter.com/INDEEwu740

762007641157693441 2016-08-06 19:29:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @xenocryptsite if i characterized your neighborhood that way, wouldn't you be pissed? it's lazy
762006268408164352 2016-08-06 19:23:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> RIP local beat reporting at the Times?http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/public-editor/liz-spayd-new-york-times-public-editor.html?smid=tw-share
762005236638748672 2016-08-06 19:19:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism more like is this what we can expect from the new public editor

761757259630317569 2016-08-05 02:54:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus @tanzoak sounds like a  recipe for a bunch of people being saddled with mortgages they can't afford in the long run
761744322899349504 2016-08-05 02:02:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus @tanzoak lol that's not how the money works
761744072839163904 2016-08-05 02:01:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus @tanzoak if you are subsidizing housing for people who make $40K, then they should actually be able to pay for it
761743973182570496 2016-08-05 02:01:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus @tanzoak i think this is a reflection of why our AMI numbers are complete garbage and don't help poor people!
761743602317979648 2016-08-05 02:00:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus @tanzoak this is a big project where the market-rate and higher income "affordable" units are largely subsidizing these ones
761733698094043136 2016-08-05 01:20:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime yeah :( imma be paying them back till i'm 50
761731238285672448 2016-08-05 01:10:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime and those NYU sweatshirts are so expensive
761730496451706880 2016-08-05 01:07:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tanzoak @markasaurus and for people living at that income level, section 8 being able to fill the gap if they lose work is big too...
761729725962289152 2016-08-05 01:04:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tanzoak @markasaurus $800 or $900 a month is absolute top of her budget
761729638443941888 2016-08-05 01:04:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tanzoak @markasaurus but yeah so i was thinking of like, i.e. my bf's family in the bronx - working class, mom makes $40K, a few kids...
761729146561101824 2016-08-05 01:02:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tanzoak @markasaurus no taxes
761727968544784385 2016-08-05 00:57:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus @tanzoak but you're right, 179K ones are not bad
761726602455707648 2016-08-05 00:52:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus @tanzoak sure but at the higher end (250K), if you have kids, imagine two people with $23K paychecks...
761692592748761088 2016-08-05 22:37:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tanzoak mortgage and downpayment is a stretch for most people in these income brackets
761689709290684416 2016-08-05 22:25:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull like i may have screened roommates more strictly than dates lol
761689510241562624 2016-08-05 22:25:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull roommate screening is the only thing worse than dating

760212953664749568 2016-08-01 20:37:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@MarketUrbanism's legacy comes through when architects are ashamed to tell me they are using PTACs
760205266835083264 2016-08-01 20:07:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @allisonbhartman yes their twitter actually responded to me to tell me that!
760201561008140289 2016-08-01 19:52:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism no doubt that was an editor's decision, not the reporter's
760201276944683008 2016-08-01 19:51:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> They should've hired @timdonnelly for their G train reporting http://brokelyn.com/the-g-train-has-feelings-too-guys/

760199757973299200 2016-08-01 19:45:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> It wouldn't really be an NYT piece on the G train without quotes from an editor at Viceland and a graphic designer http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/nyregion/short-trains-frequent-disruptions-once-mocked-the-g-train-is-now-cool.html
760194982896603136 2016-08-01 19:26:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus @MarketUrbanism if i worked over there i'd be willing to make the trek to canal to hit up dragonland bakery
760193980093038597 2016-08-01 19:22:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @markasaurus there is also an excellent and cheap noodle place on doyers only a few blocks north of here
760193680959475712 2016-08-01 19:21:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @markasaurus at least you can walk over to the manhattan bridge and get some decent bubble tea
760192915746545665 2016-08-01 19:18:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus @MarketUrbanism ha yeah i know two bridges, there's nothing over there
760192726331715588 2016-08-01 19:17:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus @MarketUrbanism i did a lil research and saw rents in old bldgs on Broadway for $46-48/sf
760191621015171072 2016-08-01 19:13:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka like they either don't at all or there are very, very few places where you can pay with something besides cash
760191277539422208 2016-08-01 19:11:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus true for the people on those 15 floors
760191201546993665 2016-08-01 19:11:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka apparently they don't!
760190851893067777 2016-08-01 19:09:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> So someone was telling me that SEPTA still uses metal tokens...and you can only pay for them in cash?
760190142862790661 2016-08-01 19:07:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader are you running this
760190015364296704 2016-08-01 19:06:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus also gotta be towards the low end of the market for a building this ugly and windowless, lol
760189002955780096 2016-08-01 19:02:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus turns out having a bunch of hundred year old office buildings in one place, where they also have to compete with new, helps
760188375353688064 2016-08-01 19:00:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markasaurus which is actually close to other old office buildings nearby, surprisingly. FiDi much cheaper than midtown

758010343901827072 2016-07-26 18:45:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> That being said, they are beautiful Beaux Arts buildings from the 1890s and I am glad they are being restored
758008893595348992 2016-07-26 18:39:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> Fun fact: the landmarked buildings were built for "private patients," i.e. rich people who could afford own rooms http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/2002PlantScrymserPavilions.pdf
758008180869885957 2016-07-26 18:36:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> St Luke's Hospital sold off its landmarked buildings in Morningside Heights, and now they are going to become apts http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/07/historic-st-lukes-hospital-buildings-set-to-become-apartments-at-30-morningside-drive.html
758004624938893312 2016-07-26 18:22:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caseyjohnston if i don't eat w/in 15 mins after class, and i don't eat enough calories during day, i def feel like i'm going to pass out
758004236143697920 2016-07-26 18:21:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caseyjohnston i started kickboxing in the spring, & it's such a condensed amount of exercise that i need to eat something immediately after
758001747247890433 2016-07-26 18:11:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald lol this sounds scary
758001430519250944 2016-07-26 18:09:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChintzAge this is one of the number one complaints I've heard from smaller developers
757979038736584704 2016-07-26 16:41:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @resnikoff also known as fish sauce, which many asian cultures (particularly thai) use regularly in cooking

757752538967998464 2016-07-25 01:40:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @miller_stephen also seems like google's way of saying "look at our benevolent use of your personal location data"

757648630023086080 2016-07-25 18:48:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> Even the color scheme for new subway cars and buses might come down to the lame feud between de Blasio and Cuomo http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160718/BLOGS04/160719894
757646205136560128 2016-07-25 18:38:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @derektmead and like what info would that be....
757646119686070277 2016-07-25 18:38:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @derektmead so are you saying they did the hack to find some kind of valuable info at DNC?
757645684371755009 2016-07-25 18:36:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thisisantoine_ and i would think for folks doing new construction, smart time to buy would be right before/just as it starts
757643894456713216 2016-07-25 18:29:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thisisantoine_ a lot of the hood is still walkable to other trains though
757640430515290112 2016-07-25 18:15:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> Do you ever think hysteria about Bushwick's rental market during the L train shutdown is mostly created by brokers? Just a thought lol
757639170701557760 2016-07-25 18:10:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harlanerskine how is this place?

757633073810997250 2016-07-25 17:46:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @taylorjwofford hm but possibly electing a fascist dictator does seem like a pretty strong counterargument
757632756851548160 2016-07-25 17:45:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emmagf @2AvSagas @MarketUrbanism i feel like something to that effect was mentioned during the meetings. cc @danielleiat @vinbarone
757631913238601728 2016-07-25 17:41:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> I like how the MTA board doesn't meet during August, just like Congress, so everyone can go on vacation for a month
757621423909330944 2016-07-25 16:59:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC link is broken?

757609939493908480 2016-07-25 16:14:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin they made some fake burned out lots covered in graffiti out in ENY for this show. at least they hired local artists for murals!
757608228612141056 2016-07-25 16:07:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin @weareyourfek also siiiiigh jay rosen. so most of these people are pundits, publishers, or EICs? and gay talesee & david simon
757607180543594497 2016-07-25 16:03:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin @weareyourfek whoops 36, i am bad at counting clearly
757606726363389952 2016-07-25 16:01:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin @weareyourfek i count 35 total
757606427968102400 2016-07-25 16:00:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @weareyourfek @MattZeitlin I'd consider Ross Barkan, Sabrina Siddiqui, and Erik Wemple daily reporters. idk about the rest
757605656371290112 2016-07-25 15:57:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 sounds heavy! but they are excellent shots so this just complicates my camera buying decisions :D
757600172788580352 2016-07-25 15:35:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand ugh makeup is just unacceptable when it's 95 out
757598917433450496 2016-07-25 15:30:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand seems very subtle on you. so you could wear it for every day stuff? or more for just going out?
757598260789964800 2016-07-25 15:27:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand help, what's the purpose of highlighter?
757597486202626048 2016-07-25 15:24:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 these are really good. what camera did you use?
757597204240621568 2016-07-25 15:23:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlexJamesFitz @sokane1 sounds very hot whatever day you shot it
757596347763752960 2016-07-25 15:20:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AllisonCMeier time to start biking!
757595610379943937 2016-07-25 15:17:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> If DOB were using SWOs to actually ensure safer sites, that would be great, but process is still open to corruption http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/07/with-eye-to-safety-city-shutting-down-construction-jobs-at-record-rate-104153

757593034703929348 2016-07-25 15:07:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brendancheney @Chronotope @pwthornton one and two-family homes pay the lowest property taxes of any property type. the condo is abated
757590485070442497 2016-07-25 14:57:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand these people probably should not be part of regular society
757590237203853314 2016-07-25 14:56:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat is this a press conference? sounds like they are just repeating everything said at the meetings
757589748177305600 2016-07-25 14:54:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik house to the right looks newer, could've been a 1910s or 1920s build
757589187847684096 2016-07-25 14:51:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik or maybe they were on the lot next door, and the widow sold it off
757588526473109504 2016-07-25 14:49:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik only possible stable is little garage in the back, and who knows what shape that's in. or they could've been on the driveway
757587935432769536 2016-07-25 14:46:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> So @brendancheney is doing an interesting thing on inequitable property taxes in Politico's real estate newsletterpic.twitter.com/bMKA7w0nkW
757587287156948997 2016-07-25 14:44:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @JacobGarchik even if it did, you couldn't fit stables on that lot
757586478281162752 2016-07-25 14:41:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday should put "neighborhood oracle" in your twitter bio
757586049149394945 2016-07-25 14:39:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin and you have M train repairs to look forward to before the L shuts down (though not at Hewes)
757583550208237569 2016-07-25 14:29:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_john_sherman as a follow-up to this tweet, lolhttps://twitter.com/thecitywanderer/status/756554451712868352
757579449726566400 2016-07-25 14:13:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday also got a press release about this house. great porch, dated interiors (so much yellow!) http://streeteasy.com/building/170-stratford-road-brooklyn

757578686979829761 2016-07-25 14:10:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @maryjaneweedman @rachelholliday and with any luck it wouldn't collapse on you!
757578222242496516 2016-07-25 14:08:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @JacobGarchik also looks like there's a tree growing into the house...at best needs to be cut back, worst it's leaning on it
757577907887800321 2016-07-25 14:07:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman ahahaha sad
757577602345361409 2016-07-25 14:05:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @JacobGarchik yeah you'd need a good architect. also the roof might need fixing too, which is $$$
757577206893871104 2016-07-25 14:04:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @JacobGarchik true! most of it appears to have been well-maintained, tho you can see some water damage on top floor
757576696241516544 2016-07-25 14:02:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday it's repped by "million dollar listing" broker Ryan Serhant, so of course this was on the invitepic.twitter.com/HmePpLyRkc

757575300553244672 2016-07-25 13:56:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AllisonCMeier just random punishment for choosing to live off the L
757575068922904576 2016-07-25 13:55:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak weird how kent ave already looks fake
757567502993981440 2016-07-25 13:25:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca ha not surprising, but i love it bc it's just so new york, and the very noirish way it's shot
757566540141256704 2016-07-25 13:21:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> Wow, just started watching The Night Of and it's pretty excellent
757420154418520065 2016-07-24 03:40:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @ISANobody_ uh no it's the opposite. we are still close to the top of the market, wait till it cools, now you'd be paying too much
757419698157981700 2016-07-24 03:38:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @ISANobody_ what are you talking about? who would be worried about this, developers?
757418020243472384 2016-07-24 03:31:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @devin_mb the original piece is about new rentals, not condos, fwiw. also it depends heavily on neighborhood
757417842371399680 2016-07-24 03:31:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @ISANobody_ buyers can only hope for another recession
757416671455899648 2016-07-24 03:26:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @ISANobody_ or unless you were buying in like, the bronx
757416471777648641 2016-07-24 03:25:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @ISANobody_ I wouldn't buy now unless you could get a pretty amazing deal
757415936378998784 2016-07-24 03:23:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz omg just started watching, don't tweet spoilers
757414226751291392 2016-07-24 03:16:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nicolegelinas but once you get used to it, biking to work is quite pleasant (well unless you work in midtown)
757413321255620608 2016-07-24 03:13:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon @NoahHurowitz @KELLYWEILL just another member of the lamestream media
757412857105489920 2016-07-24 03:11:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller also trying not to bike drunk as much as I used to lol
757412750884741120 2016-07-24 03:10:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller yes I do too, but when it's really hot, I have to go into the city, and I want to dress cute, biking is a pain
757411209683542018 2016-07-24 03:04:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller yes that too! Those arrival boards totally screwed me at Atlantic the other night. 2/3 took forever to come at like 12:30ish
757408512603455492 2016-07-24 02:53:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas also sometimes the arrival times, particularly in bk, are just wrong after 10 pm
757407519811702785 2016-07-24 02:49:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas since theoretically the trains follow a schedule, can't they just tell us when 4 from utica is coming, even if it hasn't left yet?
757407281252294658 2016-07-24 02:49:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas also often true going uptown on weekends/late nights. and no arrival data till after it leaves the terminal, which is frustrating
757404360917803012 2016-07-24 02:37:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amadouworld i'm also thinking for a similar price, why not go full frame to the A7?
757403019860475905 2016-07-24 02:32:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amadouworld ... so i want a camera that will perform well shooting in RAW in extremely low light (usually at low ISO). still recommend XT1?
757402448021622788 2016-07-24 02:29:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amadouworld hi! loved your mirrorless camera review, but didn't see any night shots. i currently use a sony nex 5n & shoot a lot at night..
757393712607531008 2016-07-24 01:55:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin also it's insanely long! this must be most, if not all of, their print issue
757393155247448064 2016-07-24 01:52:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin at least it seems like they got a pretty good mix of current and former media folks from across the ideological spectrum
757385691961683969 2016-07-24 01:23:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull @teggerling i was just there and it was adorable. i stayed in corning and went to the wineries around the finger lakes
757385370988376064 2016-07-24 01:21:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull @SteveHuff vote for VT! i have family outside of montpelier and it is beautiful, also like wayyy cooler than New York year-round
757383338101501952 2016-07-24 01:13:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull valid tho lol
757383086049026048 2016-07-24 01:12:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull people with a ton of IG followers usually just know how to follow a formula/are willing to rep brands
757381809000898560 2016-07-24 01:07:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa 
757381351876206592 2016-07-24 01:06:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> Even more upsetting is the fact that no matter how liberal the governor, the VA legislature will consistently block progressive policies
757380614320492544 2016-07-24 01:03:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> What's upsetting is that Kaine's more conservative successors (Bob McDonnell!) rolled back some of his better policies in VA
757376855196442624 2016-07-24 00:48:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg @lemonsand also defunded abstinence-only sex ed, tried to prevent gay marriage ban, est'd health care for same-sex partners
757373273680310272 2016-07-24 00:33:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg @lemonsand he is certainly not perfect but was also not the gov who passed the parental consent law http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/politics/reactions-tim-kaine-pick/
757368203228086272 2016-07-24 00:13:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @nickmartin Nick used to cover politics in Arizona so I trust him on this stuff!
757330461882474496 2016-07-24 21:43:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnSurico i think trump and manafort need to have a little sit-down
757330101176561666 2016-07-24 21:42:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple he didn't even know it was a swing state then! we weren't really a swing state till '08
757328271377887232 2016-07-24 21:35:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple shhh don't tell the ant-hillary conspiracy theorists
757328119586025472 2016-07-24 21:34:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg he made progressive policy in a state w/ a history of deeply racist, conservative policies, and IMO that's more important
757327856313704448 2016-07-24 21:33:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg haha i mean yeah but he really has a pretty impeccable record for someone with like 25 years of political experience
757327523223142400 2016-07-24 21:32:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you've voted in VA or know about its electoral make-up, you know that like 70% of the counties are deeply red and definitely were in 2005
757327037593952257 2016-07-24 21:30:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> If the worst thing you can find about Tim Kaine is two radio ads he ran to win in a pretty conservative state, then I think he's doing ok
757324134342881280 2016-07-24 21:18:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jbouie omg so many crazies coming out in your mentions for this
757321737788874752 2016-07-24 21:09:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade he's never been charismatic but he's a good pol and extremely middle of the road
757320885191729152 2016-07-24 21:05:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ LES also has a lot of painfully ugly new construction, like that
757319454766272513 2016-07-24 21:00:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> People running outside in this weather are maniacs
757294511869616128 2016-07-24 19:20:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYTFridge idk about will, but yes it should be
757291458282029056 2016-07-24 19:08:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYTFridge this is media in a nut shell, for better or worse
757290484691861505 2016-07-24 19:04:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NYTFridge what is this related to?
757285757858045953 2016-07-24 18:46:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro @erinmdurkin also what about a composting toilet? do you need to have running water for that?
757284604277616641 2016-07-24 18:41:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @HenryGrabar @MarketUrbanism i bet all the businesses on those upper balconies just love how people sit on the stairs instead

757280322727870464 2016-07-24 18:24:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar @ISANobody_ I'm too short to reach the outlets on them. also i think they make most sense on long, cross-boro express routes
757277889998024708 2016-07-24 18:14:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Russian_Starr I recently looked up rents in Newark and questioned my life choices
757277365278040065 2016-07-24 18:12:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> I found it, it's the Tudor Revival "Castle" at Boston University https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University_Center_for_Philosophy_and_History_of_Science#/media/File:BU_Castle2.jpg

757268458853785602 2016-07-24 17:37:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also I am heartened by the fact that most of the exterior shots in Ghostbusters were in Boston. I kept thinking it just didn't look like NYC

757255581098999808 2016-07-24 16:46:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @HenryGrabar the lack of outlets at GCT is annoying. i know the building is 100+ years old, but could we do some basic upgrades?

757245893556961280 2016-07-24 16:07:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Especially what people have been tweeting at Chuck Todd.. we all get these kinds of emails every day. Appalling.
757244510036426753 2016-07-24 16:02:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> People seem really intent on using the DNC email leaks to indict journalists mostly doing their jobs as they should

755861558656397312 2016-07-20 20:26:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC pretty sure it appears briefly near the beginning of new season of Mr. Robot as the headquarters of "Evil Corp"
755860988059090944 2016-07-20 20:24:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC now keep seeing TV shows and movies using PPG Place as the headquarters for miscellaneous evil corporations
755845358199025665 2016-07-20 19:22:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar where the N/Q trains enter and leave the tunnel onto the manhattan br, there's big open space where J tracks were ripped out
755844352979587073 2016-07-20 19:18:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrystie_Street_Connection https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMT_Brooklyn_Loops from when the J used to run over the manhattan bridge
755843846563467265 2016-07-20 19:16:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar i wasn't talking about that, but also interesting! i meant the severing of nassau street loops/building chrystie st connection
755841667861622784 2016-07-20 19:07:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar also v complex history on how those tracks next to the bridge were reorganized in 60s/70s, always interested me
755835083332915200 2016-07-20 18:41:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas looks heavy
755803925215862784 2016-07-20 16:37:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik and Park Slope, Gowanus, Cobble Hill, etc
755803610538184704 2016-07-20 16:36:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i think that's true
755802785166295040 2016-07-20 16:33:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism at least in the case of inwood, white people lived there forever and a decent number stuck around even in white flght
755801893155332096 2016-07-20 16:29:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> Good piece on the white-Dominican divide on either side of Broadway in Inwood https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160719/inwood/inwood-is-actually-two-neighborhoods-divided-by-race-class-broadway
755799895060123648 2016-07-20 16:21:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy and since you can't landmark a building that already has a demo permit, the developer didn't really need to rush
755799594144043008 2016-07-20 16:20:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy folks only tried to landmark the ENY bank after a building application and demo permit were already in place
755799447687274496 2016-07-20 16:20:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy sure. i mean rizzoli is much more clear cut since landmarking had been on the table for years. not the case with this property
755799094950555648 2016-07-20 16:18:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy sorry how is rizzoli related here?
755797731386556417 2016-07-20 16:13:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy since they could have just waited a year and built a much more profitable building
755797659559030786 2016-07-20 16:12:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy i just wonder if it was simply bad planning or if they rushed to demo because they were actually worried about landmarking
755797352338907136 2016-07-20 16:11:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandayaggy yeah they organized the landmarking push after i wrote about this building in brownstoner
755795031143874561 2016-07-20 16:02:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> Basically C8 zoning is bad and now you could put housing here! Possibly the developer rushed to file to avoid possibility of landmarking
755792954355310592 2016-07-20 15:54:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism oh this is the Times one. i guess their point is that there were a bunch of zoning issues at play?

755519647764676608 2016-07-19 21:48:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> It makes me sad because exercise should be fun but still too many women are intimidated or frustrated and don't see it that way
755519101825613824 2016-07-19 21:46:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> A lot of workout advice I see for women comes from ladies mags and is kinda bad/doesn't encourage a healthy attitude toward exerise
755518810434707460 2016-07-19 21:44:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> Nice to see a positive approach to lifting/working out for women from a new @caseyjohnston column on the Hairpin https://thehairpin.com/ask-a-swole-woman-getting-started-36849181c388#.drn8ljqa9

755211784370393088 2016-07-18 01:24:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb what's annoying is i had to use the black-white segregation score. when i asked the editor about hispanics, he was like \_()_/
755210204724207616 2016-07-18 01:18:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb the reason i remember this is because i had to make this dumb slideshow for BI when i was an internhttp://www.businessinsider.com/most-segregated-cities-census-maps-2013-4?op=1
755210006635671552 2016-07-18 01:17:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb cool. at least as of the 2010 census data, they were considered the two most racially segregated major cities in the country.
755207291591389185 2016-07-18 01:07:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb actually i guess D.C. is still segregated, just much less black
755207055393300480 2016-07-18 01:06:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb i guess so. though the ones that are most segregated (Detroit, Milwaukee, D.C. like 10+ years ago) are very dramatic
755206459428864000 2016-07-18 01:03:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb looks pretty much like the other ones i've seen. Detroit is a very depressing one

755143570303115264 2016-07-18 20:53:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> Where are these bike cops from? Are they local Cleveland folks or from somewhere else?https://twitter.com/JimDalrympleII/status/755142665495252992
755143280598388736 2016-07-18 20:52:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler i mean there must be some men on the floor not wearing khaki pants
755143043628593153 2016-07-18 20:51:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kath_krueger this fills me with a deep dread
755141201284718596 2016-07-18 20:44:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie you're the worst
755141118963093508 2016-07-18 20:44:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly some clear bias here, not all of us like pickled things
755130739994296320 2016-07-18 20:02:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand i was 22, just shy of 23. he was 51 years old so he didn't have a will or anything
755129709357363200 2016-07-18 19:58:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand i didn't get anything when my dad died! i was supposed to i think, but my uncle was in charge of the estate & screwed it up
755128235210539009 2016-07-18 19:52:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mattdpearce @MaxRivlinNadler news outlets actually hired security detail to follow them around outside?
755128007732453376 2016-07-18 19:52:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @macfathom @DaveCoIon i can't tell if you made that up or not, dave
755127682753503236 2016-07-18 19:50:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie are you going to tell me it's like 75 degrees out
755117656517275648 2016-07-18 19:10:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad I forgot it would dramatically increase surface area to vandalize
755116994010185728 2016-07-18 19:08:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity just the mainstream flip side of those transhumanist people starving themselves to "live forever"
755116697779134465 2016-07-18 19:07:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity also...... vaginal steaming? what?
755113760319217665 2016-07-18 18:55:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman I'm not experienced in the ways of Zaro's bagels, but the cookie was excellent
755113315009978369 2016-07-18 18:53:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler lol
755112842261561344 2016-07-18 18:51:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler surprised you're not inside the convention! but seems kinda boring right now too
755111442479587328 2016-07-18 18:46:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman honestly they should be on this list
755109582150725632 2016-07-18 18:38:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman i had one at the Zaro's at GCT over the weekend and it was damn good
755108181014183937 2016-07-18 18:33:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @NoahHurowitz @ConalDarcy also offices, not a condo
755107938889560064 2016-07-18 18:32:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @NoahHurowitz @ConalDarcy yup. those plans have been in place for a number of years, they were stalled by the recession
755107577818742784 2016-07-18 18:30:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk wasn't sure if that one had actually closed. worth noting that the owners of that one (and a few other stations) became developers
755102321772728320 2016-07-18 18:09:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @NoahHurowitz isn't there a gas station at broadway-lafayette?
755101772121837568 2016-07-18 18:07:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @ptrmsk i assume it's like loitering at seven-eleven

755097850246262784 2016-07-18 17:52:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> Tried watching the RNC livestream and it was just white people dancing
755097732579225600 2016-07-18 17:51:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AFeinDude lol this photo was taken by Aymann! (which I assume you knew?) also lol at advertising for adderall on tinder
755095776867520512 2016-07-18 17:43:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman happy birthday!!
755093673881247744 2016-07-18 17:35:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> As usual, Aymann is lurking where he is not supposed to, this time at the RNChttps://twitter.com/aymanndotcom/status/755086114495590400
755089984663740416 2016-07-18 17:20:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @MarketUrbanism if they start getting rid of the green lamps i will be kinda sad
755088796799078400 2016-07-18 17:16:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @MarketUrbanism what will we do without those print out subway service change signs and some orange tape across the entrance
755087898609852420 2016-07-18 17:12:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas nooo does this mean they are going to scrap the green lamps
755087448334602240 2016-07-18 17:10:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas if they are going to do this, they should at least do it in the high traffic stations
755087368923873280 2016-07-18 17:10:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas well.... i guess if you're going to be waiting for the R train forever...
755085703906754560 2016-07-18 17:03:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman no doubt. living near the canal is no picnic either from what i've heard - flooding, etc
755084435792560130 2016-07-18 16:58:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman yeah, being relatively young and childless definitely helps! i see no reason to pay crazy rent in the slope or BK Heights
755083636429447168 2016-07-18 16:55:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman :-/. i spend around a third of my income on rent, but i also stayed in a less-than-perfect apt in a gentrifying hood
755082885137305600 2016-07-18 16:52:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @brooklyn11211 i know
755081758127816705 2016-07-18 16:48:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman why did you go back?
755081222368419841 2016-07-18 16:46:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman weird, i'm going to miss your brooklyn bike lane hating
755080935217963009 2016-07-18 16:44:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman at least you're not tweeting jokes about the RNC
755080340998328321 2016-07-18 16:42:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman lol a concerted effort to unfollow you?
755079705691361281 2016-07-18 16:40:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen @NoahHurowitz ha yeah. also equating this one kid with a notorious nightclub that pisses off neighbors is silly
755079188202291200 2016-07-18 16:38:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @Jill_Jorgensen that too, and makes sense it would be a parazzo photo
755078766528004097 2016-07-18 16:36:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen @NoahHurowitz i guess Jay Z did hang out there for a time http://nypost.com/2013/12/23/power-struggle-could-sink-la-marina/ http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/nyregion/a-place-to-be-seen-and-heard-in-upper-manhattan.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=789683206125ECC7BF3AF9ED7C3F0E6B&gwt=pay
755078071695343616 2016-07-18 16:33:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jill_Jorgensen @NoahHurowitz the photo shows them at La Marina, one of the restaurants/nightclubs she is talking about in inwood
755077311133806592 2016-07-18 16:30:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie everything is big at the Tyson's Corner mall in Northern VA! i think that's the only one i've really been in. also i hate malls
755076673679323136 2016-07-18 16:28:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, construction worker was crushed to death there last year; the contracting firm was convicted of manslaughter https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160713/meatpacking-district/we-will-not-obey-sentence-worker-death-construction-co-tells-judge
755076118483525632 2016-07-18 16:25:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie the only ones i have been to were in malls in the suburbs so they were probs pretty big
755075299407265794 2016-07-18 16:22:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Restoration Hardware runs afoul of strict commercial zoning in Meatpacking by planning a store that's too largehttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160718/meatpacking-district/restoration-hardware-flagship-store-is-too-big-for-ninth-ave-city-says
755072276719173640 2016-07-18 16:10:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @laura_nelson @woolie they do address that in the piece tho
755070871312662529 2016-07-18 16:04:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i still can't get over the fact that the old city hall station is landmarked but the MTA considers itself exempt from those laws
755050859134873600 2016-07-18 14:45:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> Some fun photos from when it was still abandoned http://abandonedplaces.livejournal.com/2244747.html
755050337887723520 2016-07-18 14:43:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand place looks enormous, even in Cleveland, it is not going to be cheap to fix up. maybe the satanic folks will crowdfund to help?
755050004771930112 2016-07-18 14:42:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand it must have been neglected for much longer than it was abandoned... you can see the holes/sagging in the roof in the Vice piece
755049379061456896 2016-07-18 14:39:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand reminds me of anyone who wants to fix up an abandoned building! clearly he hasn't done much work http://abandonedplaces.livejournal.com/2244747.html
755048200629841920 2016-07-18 14:34:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> He notes that the city had planned to turn it into a parking lot before he bought it (at auction?) for $13,000
755039785044017153 2016-07-18 14:01:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is actually an interesting piece since the owner (a Satanist) rescued an abandoned, 19th c. funeral home that was going to be demo'd
755038017354665984 2016-07-18 13:54:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> The RNC content you needed and expected from Vicehttps://twitter.com/VICE/status/755036164520808452
754909886815895552 2016-07-17 05:25:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mattdpearce @WilliamTurton but New York is not!
754900194894966785 2016-07-17 04:46:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also watching him talk over Stahl repeatedly is offensive
754897946559311872 2016-07-17 04:37:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just watched weird Trump-Pence interview and I gotta give @LesleyRStahl props for not letting them duck questions http://www.mediaite.com/tv/the-5-most-awkward-moments-from-the-donald-trump-mike-pence-60-minutes-interview/
754892354646138880 2016-07-17 04:15:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SakiWaki @4rilla thanks! that's a good idea, my friend lives right there next to greenpoint landing, we've watched them from his roof b4
754891181545365504 2016-07-17 04:10:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @4rilla this developer just got a big round of financing too! that building is going to be much bigger soon
754888225798418432 2016-07-17 03:59:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> from what i can gather, the neighborhoods around newark penn are relatively safe already
754864985529016320 2016-07-17 02:26:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> Where can you find one-bedrooms for less than a thousand a month or two bedrooms for $1200? Mind-boggling
754862959604731904 2016-07-17 02:18:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism seems like they have new construction fedders-style stuff that is even better looking than that! and yes so cheap!
754862402357919744 2016-07-17 02:16:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad also sad: a bunch of the abandoned things in Newark are industrial superfund sites no one wants to clean up :(
754861879860822017 2016-07-17 02:14:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad plus so many abandoned spots nearby! not bad at all tbh, esp with access to a car
754861477996163072 2016-07-17 02:12:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> Sounds amazing, already planning a trip therehttp://ny.eater.com/2016/2/26/11117028/best-food-ironbound-newark
754849254603194368 2016-07-17 01:24:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @paimaanL it seems cool! i'm friendly with some street artists and a few live there. is it relatively safe?
754846840269463552 2016-07-17 01:14:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @paimaanL what did you think of it there? i guess that's a college-y area but how was the hood/downtown?
754845774119337984 2016-07-17 01:10:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @paimaanL from what part of Newark??
754845177173475329 2016-07-17 01:08:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> Lololol http://convention.gop/post/147558746375/2016-gop-convention-program-announcedpic.twitter.com/i6OQ3nsizG
754839620538494976 2016-07-17 00:46:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @paimaanL if i lived there i'd be kind of up in arms about the fact that there are no free transfers between light rail and PATH
754839407434268672 2016-07-17 00:45:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @paimaanL i know! well kind of. parts of it do
754839271064961028 2016-07-17 00:44:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> I recently met someone who lived in Ironbound. Cheap rent, good restaurants, artist community, solid transit. Seems pretty good to me!
754832310969765889 2016-07-17 00:17:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> I was looking at listings in Newark today and fantasizing about all the money I could save
754827572157054981 2016-07-17 23:58:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CahnEmily was this taken from JC?
754810851195023360 2016-07-17 22:51:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly like only one lobster roll, right?
754774239006298112 2016-07-17 20:26:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mccanner uh
754757404831670274 2016-07-17 19:19:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade no worries
754740791843651584 2016-07-17 18:13:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade sure but if you plan to shoot the protests, you have to be prepared for what the cops will use against protesters
754739555023060992 2016-07-17 18:08:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade http://www.wired.com/2016/07/photographers-gearing-republican-convention-like-war/
754736859180310528 2016-07-17 17:57:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> You can bring guns to downtown Cleveland during the RNC, apparently https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/14/heading-to-cleveland-take-our-quiz-on-what-is-and-isnt-allowed-in-the-convention-event-zone/
754733854884294656 2016-07-17 17:45:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> Not too many people building new commercial space in the Village! Certainly not a new movie theater
754732144589758464 2016-07-17 17:39:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb no the only thing they care about is the back side (Cornelia Street) looking nice
754731564169330688 2016-07-17 17:36:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Block association seems unsympathetic to the idea that commercial zoning is extremely restrictive here and it's not a super profitable biz
754730339357061122 2016-07-17 17:31:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> oh maybe! i haven't lived in D.C. in eight years so i'm not familiar with the local controversies anymore
754729998766997509 2016-07-17 17:30:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne which Rivington people?
754729710911913984 2016-07-17 17:29:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> what do you mean? i don't recall an example in recent years
754728422652411904 2016-07-17 17:24:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> Possibly the first time I've ever heard this complaint in New York? Someone would rather apartments than commercial that benefits the hood?
754728220126285824 2016-07-17 17:23:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> "Village residents prefer pricey apartments on Cornelia St rather than allow IFC Center to expand its theater there" https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160715/west-village/residents-prefer-pricey-townhouse-over-ifc-expansion-onto-cornelia-st
754711732002717696 2016-07-17 16:17:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> As a foilist, she'd be following in the footsteps of Erinn Smart, who got a silver medal as part of a team in 2008 http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer08/columns/story?id=3539481
754709358181777408 2016-07-17 16:08:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> Excited to see Nzingha Prescod profiled in NYT, as she hopes to become the first black fencer to win Olympic gold http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/15/brooklyn-fencer-whose-sport-opened-whole-other-world-seeks-rios-gold/?_r=1&mtrref=undefined&gwh=31B3CA898153479BFC05C23CD715DAAB&gwt=pay
754706710405808128 2016-07-17 15:57:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb @ISANobody_ if they respond at all, it happens very slowly
754547673575849984 2016-07-16 05:25:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb this whole piece is poorly framed but inwood does have a serious problem with late night noise for a dense resi neighborhood
754546725482889218 2016-07-16 05:22:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb filing a 311 complaint isn't the same as calling the cops, and clearly she didn't know his name. the other stuff yeah
754478922369208321 2016-07-16 00:52:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb tbh would be more willing to revisit chili's, if only for the bizarre sentimental value
754478798222008320 2016-07-16 00:52:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb my parents used to take me to chili's all the time when i was little. pretty sure i have not set foot in one since i was 10ish?
754478191746646016 2016-07-16 00:49:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin @JoeTacopino I bet he was flying out of Newark
754478039413784576 2016-07-16 00:49:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb I recently ate at an Applebees for the first time in at least a decade and it was pretty depressing
754476977986428929 2016-07-16 00:45:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> Did Chili's pay for this post? http://mashable.com/2016/07/16/mike-pence-chilis/#wEFzkaMTmsql

754172040249212928 2016-07-15 04:33:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito lord save us from garbage pokemon go content
754171535989039104 2016-07-15 04:31:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito about pokemon go specifically? i'm not surprised but i haven't been paying close attention
754160048646025216 2016-07-15 03:45:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also they always send young female reporters out to do these embarrassing stories
754159760631533568 2016-07-15 03:44:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> The Post is consistently trolling everyone under 30https://twitter.com/connortryan/status/754156131455565824
754150716202180608 2016-07-15 03:08:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn might just be stringer/citizen journalist type thing, idk, hard to tell how this stuff goes down with breaking news
754149761855451136 2016-07-15 03:04:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn yeah pretty sure these photos are from Reuters, unless the same photog is selling their stuff to both
754140995449675776 2016-07-15 02:29:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> Reuters has people on the ground reporting/taking excellent photoshttps://twitter.com/reutersworld/status/754136973309280257
754137107745107968 2016-07-15 02:14:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn wow do they say who took these?
754119660942024704 2016-07-15 01:05:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @hragv sure, but kicking media out of their offices and thinking that will stop them from reporting seems borne of outdated thinking
754118012811218950 2016-07-15 00:58:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @hragv bizarre that they are sending so many people to invade offices of news outlets

754055617384476673 2016-07-15 20:50:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielOffner since I think anyone who loved 5 Pointz would want to help the projects that are still active avoid the same fate
754055214014095360 2016-07-15 20:49:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielOffner I loved 5 Pointz too but seems silly to keep doing postmortems when you could direct coverage to projects that need it/money

754005648568938496 2016-07-15 17:32:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schadenfraade it hasn't really been talked about that much, but that erik wemple post really helped highlight how it worked
753994507734159360 2016-07-15 16:47:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @schadenfraade you know i worked for Roll Call after college and this was a big part of their beef with Politico

753990203098984448 2016-07-15 16:30:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie it's just tiring to see journos lamenting the demise of 5 Pointz when they could be talking about what's happening right now
753989920813907973 2016-07-15 16:29:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie that's what the curbed piece is about!
753988491789406208 2016-07-15 16:23:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> In fact, there has been another mural project going on nearby in LIC for close to a year! They would love the press http://www.artsorg.nyc/
753987919958933504 2016-07-15 16:21:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie I know, but doesn't make it any less lazy! The original piece the photo essay links to is lazy too
753986620718710785 2016-07-15 16:16:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> Is 5 Pointz just an easy reference for people too lazy to look up other street art? It was demo'd over a year agohttps://twitter.com/CityLimitsNews/status/753986038519988225

753607533017858048 2016-07-14 15:10:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Sr_Lazarus especially since it's only in manhattan, where transportation is easy to find/runs frequently/serves the wealthiest residents
753606912386695168 2016-07-14 15:07:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Sr_Lazarus we already have great public transpo here! the only realistic outcome for this is more cars on the streets/less revenue for MTA

753426928254713856 2016-07-13 03:12:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm late to Uber Pool commute card news, but a car service undercutting the subway is dumb for so many reasonshttp://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/07/11/uber_s_manhattan_commute_card_signifies_the_company_s_move_from_taxis_towards.html

752989945774673920 2016-07-12 22:16:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petesaunders3 i just don't understand what this discussion about the schools has to do with upzoning
752989838354317316 2016-07-12 22:15:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petesaunders3 Bloomberg closed hundreds of schools. we have one of the country's most segregated school systems.
752987186103017473 2016-07-12 22:05:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petesaunders3 can you explain a little further?
752984847107420160 2016-07-12 21:55:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petesaunders3 why doesn't CPS just redistrict to force integration, like New York City's DOE did? the admin is just inherently racist?
752983146694598656 2016-07-12 21:49:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petesaunders3 this seems pretty sad, management-wise, but it's pretty tough to link the phenomenon of school closings to upzoning
752976941251256322 2016-07-12 21:24:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @ISANobody_ we aren't really closing schools here but redistricting was a big deal http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/nyregion/race-and-class-collide-in-a-plan-for-two-brooklyn-schools.html
752975536939499521 2016-07-12 21:18:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @DanielKayHertz tbh these kind of fights in New York City are happening in areas that are also tightly zoned/very segregated
752974518570848256 2016-07-12 21:14:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @ISANobody_ seems like faulty logic to equate latent racism in the school system with zoning. that can happen w/o upzoning
752971267104538624 2016-07-12 21:01:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @ISANobody_ i guess the link with zoning doesn't totally track for me

752933051420831744 2016-07-12 18:30:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz right... and i guess i'm confused about how there's a concrete link to the school closings
752931292015104000 2016-07-12 18:23:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz or he's drawing a comparison to say he thinks upzoning creates segregation by drawing resources away from certain hoods?
752929556718321664 2016-07-12 18:16:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz he seems to conflate the mismanagement in Emanuel's admin with zoning?

751511354142490625 2016-07-08 20:20:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @scb1892 @alon_levy @MarketUrbanism plenty of options in brooklyn! i feel like utica would be fine for tram too.

751501660292194304 2016-07-08 19:42:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism wasn't vacant. it was occupied until the end of December as a hotel. C of O still says SRO http://www.westsiderag.com/2016/01/04/city-says-park-79-shouldnt-be-operating-as-a-hotel

751496632152297472 2016-07-08 19:22:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm it made me pretty sad; it's mean to keep cats in cages

751487710649548801 2016-07-08 18:46:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC @2AvSagas and appeal to rich white tourists who want to go from williamsburg to dumbo or red hook
751487384785747968 2016-07-08 18:45:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC @2AvSagas and no one wants to pay to extend the VZ on either side or whatever the alternative would be
751486942706040832 2016-07-08 18:43:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC @2AvSagas Lol but imagine the lost toll revenue! DOT would not have it
751486337396727808 2016-07-08 18:41:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC @2AvSagas jfc you guys
751485744540254208 2016-07-08 18:38:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller yes! http://ny.curbed.com/2013/1/2/10290180/16-photos-inside-fidis-famed-temple-court-at-5-beekman-st
751485003096260624 2016-07-08 18:36:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller the incredible thing is the way it's been restored actually, the beautiful atrium & lobby were very neglected
751484667191263232 2016-07-08 18:34:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller anyway the sneaking in thing is a moot point now since temple court is reopening as a fancy hotel in august
751484535829848068 2016-07-08 18:34:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller no woolworth is moving extremely slowly
751484101643866113 2016-07-08 18:32:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller it's temple court, it was abandoned for years, of course people have been in before it was converted
751483951315902464 2016-07-08 18:31:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller @ltvsquad true! this one is pretty small, but yeah less discreet looking https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Session-CHDHS-101-Waterproof-Camera/dp/B010H05JMQ?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B010H05JMQ&linkCode=as2&linkId=IK53W5HGT5HUUVBX&redirect=true&ref_=as_li_tl&tag=cnet-ce-20

751481372825493504 2016-07-08 18:21:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller @ltvsquad actually not terribly priced for what it is. how's the video and still quality?
751461282759446528 2016-07-08 17:01:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickmartin all right, i'll make an exception to my no jonathan chait rule

751458588174979072 2016-07-08 16:51:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> I would not be happy if i worked in room 9 either. #deblasiosnewyork http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bed-bugs-found-new-york-city-hall-article-1.2703209

751451361464778752 2016-07-08 16:22:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also fun - the 55-story condo tower across the street managed to stop work on this project bc they didn't want their views blocked
751451141691600897 2016-07-08 16:21:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> Thanks @MarketUrbanism for this new rendering of 15 East 30th, future 750-foot condo tower http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/07/new-look-for-15-east-30th-street-750-foot-condo-tower.htmlpic.twitter.com/FkYqigBWCB

751447468525707268 2016-07-08 16:06:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> Lol at this headline but also good for you, A.V. Club http://www.avclub.com/article/stop-jizzing-all-over-journalism-239196
751447025992990720 2016-07-08 16:05:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon lol i don't know how @madddesign deals with this
751446803883622401 2016-07-08 16:04:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon this is the recipe i use, except i do almond milk and use honey instead of maple syrup and vanilla http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Overnight-Oats-Recipe-34698639
751446144660697088 2016-07-08 16:01:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon its too hot for frugality. i went to a coffee shop yesterday because i felt like i was going to pass out in my apartment
751445696545513472 2016-07-08 15:59:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon you know you could do overnight oatmeal in the fridge. its super easy, i do it all the time
751445463178571776 2016-07-08 15:58:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon omg why don't you have an AC? and why are you eating oatmeal right now
751445280109764608 2016-07-08 15:58:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon i thought it was just a dumb santana joke
751445167194906624 2016-07-08 15:57:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon you did this on purpose, didn't you
751444996612554752 2016-07-08 15:57:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon @Quaker ahahaa
751444786981273604 2016-07-08 15:56:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale this city can be so small and there are so few decent coffee shops where you can get work done! i guess that narrows it down lol
751444349729271808 2016-07-08 15:54:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you do real estate PR, never do this
751441156442062848 2016-07-08 15:41:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> Sitting near Molly Crabapple in this FiDi coffee shop
751440987835228160 2016-07-08 15:41:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just went on a tour of a beautiful historic bldg where I wasn't allowed to take photos! And PR people didn't tell me in advance. Not cool.
751437501718487040 2016-07-08 15:27:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik the vacant parts of KCH are already being redeveloped into affordable housing
751286156214439936 2016-07-07 05:25:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexnazaryan Howl would be wildly appropriate
751285783420477440 2016-07-07 05:24:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj cant avoid this garbage tonight
751262177416257537 2016-07-07 03:50:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @im_sinclair also public housing - pretty bleak that lot of it in NYC & elsewhere was built by evicting thousands from slums
751256161886806016 2016-07-07 03:26:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @DanielKayHertz section 8 lists in new york have been functionally closed since 2011 or 2012
751256047508189184 2016-07-07 03:26:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @DanielKayHertz because it's taken five years just to restore two thirds of Section 8 vouchers cut during the recession
751255459303153664 2016-07-07 03:23:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @im_sinclair obviously expanding section 8 and similar would be great but it's seeming increasingly unlikely
751255113998688256 2016-07-07 03:22:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @im_sinclair tax credits are a double-edged sword. vouchers come mostly from fed money that no longer exists. yay upzoning!
751254723748069376 2016-07-07 03:20:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AbundantHousing @DanielKayHertz hm but what if taxes are already seen as prohibitively high where you live, esp for multi-fam
751254157764521984 2016-07-07 03:18:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @im_sinclair i totally appreciate this pie-in-the-sky federal tax reform thing but how do we deal with it right now?
751253480870928384 2016-07-07 03:16:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @deliriousmark @DanielKayHertz yeah sounds like IZ to me. and they already to this with tax credits here, 421-a and J-51
751252908428128256 2016-07-07 03:13:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @im_sinclair like ok maybe this would all be great in 20-30 years but we have low-income tenants suffering now
751252088554942465 2016-07-07 03:10:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @DanielKayHertz they are not particularly below market from what i've seen
751251752075354113 2016-07-07 03:09:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @im_sinclair the developments happening now are a stopgap to raise the money needed so NYCHA doesn't have to tear down more
751251630427926529 2016-07-07 03:08:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @im_sinclair NYCHA owns 19th century townhouses in Harlem that were decrepit and horrible. so many of their buildings are.
751251390928916480 2016-07-07 03:07:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @im_sinclair problem is we don't have the money to maintain the public housing WE HAVE. which is the biggest in the country.
751251203347144705 2016-07-07 03:06:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @im_sinclair unless you can convince Congress to peel off a billion from some other fed program & give it to NYCHA...
751249813400907780 2016-07-07 03:01:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @DanielKayHertz since NYCHA is a couple billion in the hole, they can't afford to keep spending tax dollars they don't have
751249562115899392 2016-07-07 03:00:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @DanielKayHertz because building more public housing doesn't earn the city any money, it spends more tax $$ w/o earning any
751249206673809408 2016-07-07 02:59:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @deliriousmark @DanielKayHertz my point is its both, because New York City is constrained, logistically, in a way it wasn't 50 years ago
751248835691835392 2016-07-07 02:57:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair @DanielKayHertz it's also a basic money and space problem! we lack open land and everything is insanely expensive.
751248405607972864 2016-07-07 02:55:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz since the current methodology grew out of idea that developers using fed grants/credits (rather than govts) was better
751247972772511744 2016-07-07 02:54:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i think a more feasible option is to convince an extremely outdated agencyHUDto rethink its funding and tax credits
751247362329284610 2016-07-07 02:51:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @im_sinclair what model? convincing 400 members of congress to screw their constituents on home ownership isn't an option
751247122016641024 2016-07-07 02:50:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz there's also the fact that dollars just don't go as far here as they do in most of the country. physical costs.
751245627963633665 2016-07-07 02:44:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz also keep in mind NYCHA projects were created with big fed money.... we simply don't have it anymore
751245401215365120 2016-07-07 02:43:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz with whose money? we can't even wrench state housing funding out of Cuomo's hands, let alone major fed funding we'd need
751245177063403520 2016-07-07 02:43:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @DanielKayHertz since land now has so much more value now, the city would be giving it away if it developed lots NYCHA style
751244866600964096 2016-07-07 02:41:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @DanielKayHertz very few huge ones like there were in the early 1960s. the only ones left are in ENY, hence the rezoning
751244693489459200 2016-07-07 02:41:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @MarketUrbanism and yes, eminent domain played a part as well in some neighborhoods
751244487121305604 2016-07-07 02:40:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz because our public housing was created at a time when much of our land was worth little and construction was extremely cheap
751242550602788868 2016-07-07 02:32:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> Large-scale public housing in NYC is literally impossible, not just politically impossible https://www.thenation.com/article/this-group-pioneered-the-fight-for-15-can-they-transform-the-fight-for-affordable-housing-too/pic.twitter.com/HkE4c7x63Z
751234590061232128 2016-07-07 02:00:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts @NoahHurowitz part of your personal brand
751234142017318913 2016-07-07 01:59:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts lol mean olds is basically still a lot of print media
751233849506533376 2016-07-07 01:58:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon I mean not always but often yes. They look good in nice Chelsea projects but frequently bad in cheap BK ones
751233496765632512 2016-07-07 01:56:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts eh back in the day bstoner was the same way, but mostly mean
751233109836894208 2016-07-07 01:55:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon in this case, someone had already cut big windows on the corner that didn't match so they're just doing them all the way down
751232676774961152 2016-07-07 01:53:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon because there's a huge backlash against things that look too new in Williamsburg. It's an attempt to be "contextual"
751232315230134272 2016-07-07 01:51:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts why
751232263241789440 2016-07-07 01:51:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Jerry Saltz discovers the Knockdown Center in Maspeth like it opened yesterdayhttp://www.vulture.com/2016/06/saltz-never-was-my-breath-taken-away-like-this.html
751231970827444224 2016-07-07 01:50:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @laurenduca @dlberes yeah I like them because they flip the traditional real estate advertising paradigm that makes everything sound perfect
751229489343000576 2016-07-07 01:40:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts ok it actually sounds kind of nice http://bushwickdaily.com/bushwick/categories/news/2947-castlebraid-commune-wine-delivery
751224758637826048 2016-07-07 01:21:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @ISANobody_ yeah
751224376721338368 2016-07-07 01:20:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts that's what you get for living in hipsterville
751224086202839040 2016-07-07 01:19:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon my profession is finding new/renovated buildings with factory windows, obviously
751222979619676161 2016-07-07 01:14:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts yeah. it doesnt help that theyve been mostly vacant for a few years while the former developer got his act together
751220073017274368 2016-07-07 01:03:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay @keller_jd as far as I could tell from what the state DOC officials said, they didn't really know/care what the protocol was here
751217921490350082 2016-07-07 00:54:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay @keller_jd was it? I thought it was city and state DOC
751217473534496769 2016-07-07 00:52:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale it's freelance so it's not on YIMBY! And I'm doing edits on it now, I'll let you know when it goes up
751215226033430528 2016-07-07 00:44:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay JSK ran a very different DOT!
751214804531052544 2016-07-07 00:42:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay they dont have much veto power here so \_()_/
751211655212724224 2016-07-07 00:29:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> The Department of Corrections built a new borough parole office in Gowanus without notifying the CB and some angry meetings ensued
751209779616514052 2016-07-07 00:22:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> Especially in case of scatter site homeless buildings - often converted hotels - the city isn't obligated to give the CB much or any notice
751209092690083840 2016-07-07 00:19:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's pretty rare to find a community board in any NYC neighborhood that embraces shelters, which is why the city often does them "in secret"
751208678196412416 2016-07-07 00:18:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> A pro-growth piece in the Times! Wow.

751187459141165056 2016-07-07 22:53:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Hoping that @stevecuozzo wrote this "Suck it, hipsters" headline http://nypost.com/2016/07/06/suck-it-hipsters-fine-dining-is-back/
751180418788036608 2016-07-07 22:25:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro and even then, we're mostly talking about upper body strength
751180026549268480 2016-07-07 22:24:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro @petersterne can't they just shorten it to three matches for both genders, for the patience of the viewing public? so outdated
751177945826357248 2016-07-07 22:15:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro best of three is the normal format, right?
751177658168467456 2016-07-07 22:14:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro so she deserves to be paid less because she's so good that she finishes matches faster? what the actual fuck
751175826373246978 2016-07-07 22:07:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday wooo two more months of this
751146129660739584 2016-07-07 20:09:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @MarketUrbanism @BenRossTransit as in all things, i feel like Robert Moses may have been a catalyzing force here
751145029058564096 2016-07-07 20:05:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @MarketUrbanism oh like the Cooper Square Committee people?
751143081160937472 2016-07-07 19:57:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @alon_levy the newer immigrant community in flushing is less likely to make waves generally/engage politically...
751142865959518209 2016-07-07 19:56:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @alon_levy not sure about John Liu vis a vis his opponents, but i think chinatown machine learned to align itself with left
751140790093619200 2016-07-07 19:48:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @alon_levy i guess the larger story there is how asian community is largely locked out of/shies away from "leftist politics"
751140374530428929 2016-07-07 19:46:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @alon_levy and considering one of flushing's electeds just killed a rezoning, i think it's hard to say
751139699629096960 2016-07-07 19:43:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @alon_levy the areas that were upzoned in Murray Hill were mostly along northern boulevard and not very residential
751137863115374592 2016-07-07 19:36:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i guess except when you're talking about upzoning rich neighborhoods, which virtually never happens anymore
751137519320825856 2016-07-07 19:35:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz also i thought jane jacobs also came out of fairly leftist tradition... idk, it's always seemed either lefty/bipartisan here
751137210385231873 2016-07-07 19:34:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @alon_levy are we talking about flushing or something? i'm not sure what you're referring to
751136474255527936 2016-07-07 19:31:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz and then in the last 10-15 years, the unions got in on the action too
751136214657470464 2016-07-07 19:30:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz bc ever since the city started turning around 20+ years ago, density is gentrification/pricing people out. all the time.
751135677547511809 2016-07-07 19:27:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz it's pretty firmly grounded in leftist politics here, idk about other big cities
751135452904689664 2016-07-07 19:27:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @weareyourfek real estate is a weird specialized beat, i guess. something about it, people either love it/stay or never want to touch it
751135236076007430 2016-07-07 19:26:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz why
751134628870848512 2016-07-07 19:23:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale i'm afraid, brady
751133418382057472 2016-07-07 19:18:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> And that rendering in the TRD piece, which is different from what i remember, is pretty uninspiring
751133208910135300 2016-07-07 19:18:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> Since we're talking about Richard Mack, he finally got $$ to build that gigantic tower on the Greenpoint waterfront http://therealdeal.com/2016/07/06/mack-palin-enterprises-land-290m-construction-loan-for-greenpoint-tower/
751132833247334400 2016-07-07 19:16:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jillsheller worth reading the elizabeth spiers piece about him too
751129203932852224 2016-07-07 19:02:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @weareyourfek what beat were you covering when this whole thing happened?

751128220574023680 2016-07-07 18:58:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime i'm confused about what this tweet means, Yael

751121140370800643 2016-07-07 18:30:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC @MarketUrbanism yeah this one actually looks extremely similar to the renderings
751118091254456320 2016-07-07 18:18:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @weareyourfek he breaks a ton of news at crain's!
751116543757578241 2016-07-07 18:11:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shermaning basically because the apartment is under-market and he wants something comparable, which i think is pretty tough to find

751110741822955521 2016-07-07 17:48:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReporterLeslie @shermaning sounds pretty average for the slope
751110456245452800 2016-07-07 17:47:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> This gives me anxiety. Also, New York City should probably be in its own geographic category for "distance from mom" http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/24/upshot/24up-family.html

751102701023494144 2016-07-07 17:16:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @woolie sad that half the battle in big cities like New York is about knowing which spots are hot

751095165931126784 2016-07-07 16:46:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @surlyurbanist @woolie yes, definitely. i'm rarely scrutinized by the cops
751094948225835008 2016-07-07 16:46:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad there have been a lot of weird subway service changes that make it hard to get back to LIC late at night; i can't blame you
751094567890550784 2016-07-07 16:44:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SteveInBrooklyn me too, but if i were married, i wouldn't be
751093997037293568 2016-07-07 16:42:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @surlyurbanist @woolie yeah i agree with ian. as a reporter, there are certainly people doing on the ground work with this, but I'm not one
751091873368899584 2016-07-07 16:33:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> And Rockland and Westchester don't have to include NYC's income numbers in their AMI basically because of what happened in "Show Me a Hero."
751090493283528704 2016-07-07 16:28:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad what an extremely familiar location
751086902082699265 2016-07-07 16:14:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harrysiegel oh it's probably a household size thing! if you are married/have kids that's probably it. I fall under single people AMI
751081962882887680 2016-07-07 15:54:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> New York City's AMI includes Rockland and Westchester counties, which have higher incomes that boost our numbers http://citylimits.org/2016/02/17/the-secret-history-of-ami/
751080294208380928 2016-07-07 15:47:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> So this is dumb for many reasons, not the least of which is that NYC's metro area for housing AMIs is huge, doctored http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2015/07/gentrification_calculator_are_you_a_neighborhood_gentrifier.html#
751078868723859456 2016-07-07 15:42:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harrysiegel ok so i took this and i'm confused by the fact that you and i have different metro area AMIs in our results
751078237980225537 2016-07-07 15:39:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katieraffa sounds really good! but IMO the best part of Pimm's cup is the fruits!

751067930872414208 2016-07-07 14:58:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts they were fairly decrepit looking. and since the buildings were full of RS tenants, they probs haven't been reno'd in decades

750464601150676992 2016-07-05 23:01:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees as I said, areas that are/were served by freights - east New York/brownsville, SE Queens, Boro Park, flatlands, parts of Bx
750462612543004672 2016-07-05 22:53:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism that would have been a tall order
750459019832201216 2016-07-05 22:39:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees there are large industrial areas not on the waterfront too though
750458242850025476 2016-07-05 22:36:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees of course, but city planners made concrete choices in '61 about which nabes/industry to protect and which not
750457713700773888 2016-07-05 22:33:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees and along the freight lines
750456315819024384 2016-07-05 22:28:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DLHDara I mean maybe in 1916, but so much of what was put in place in 1961 was clearly motivated by who lived where/whether they had clout
750455025764302848 2016-07-05 22:23:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChristieSmythe or I guess it could be the reverse - the industry was already there, made it undesirable and thus extremely affordable
750453618176823296 2016-07-05 22:17:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChristieSmythe right. the idea that you keep manufacturing in place where people would be too poor or marginalized to really complain
750450060295544836 2016-07-05 22:03:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> But the freight lines were there before some of these hoods were developed, so question is whether I have my cause and effect confused
750447849020747777 2016-07-05 21:54:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @SoBendito @transbay trying to figure out if industrial zoning existed in 1916 code, but I don't think it was that specific
750444704270016513 2016-07-05 21:42:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @SoBendito @transbay I guess its sort of a chicken and egg question
750442111087042560 2016-07-05 21:31:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @AbundantHousing but how do i download this??
750441494033604609 2016-07-05 21:29:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad well, technically the first zoning code was created in 1916, but the zoning we have now is from '61. http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/background.page
750438820324241408 2016-07-05 21:18:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad 1961
750438519437484033 2016-07-05 21:17:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AdamSerwer seems legit
750437989923319808 2016-07-05 21:15:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad i.e. south bronx, east new york/brownsville, flatlands, crown heights/bed-stuy
750437609785135104 2016-07-05 21:14:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad seems clear from maps that industrial zoning was put into place in alread poor hoods where people wouldn't be able to complain
750437095546687489 2016-07-05 21:12:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad industry in places that were not seen as marginal simply wasn't protected by zoning
750436516065906688 2016-07-05 21:09:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad but there isn't really much of that there and it doesn't seem like there ever was....
750436244337942528 2016-07-05 21:08:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad i mean, maybe! i am writing about a hotel planned in ocean hill/brownsville. area is zoned C8, for like gas stations/car repair
750435081538400258 2016-07-05 21:04:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito I know @MarketUrbanism looked through it, but idk if anyone would admit that in public comments.
750434647188901888 2016-07-05 21:02:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito I feel like I need actual proof about this tho; Im just not sure where to find it
750434496089059328 2016-07-05 21:01:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito now it seems weird that people fighting gentrification cling to industrial zoning when it was created to marginalize that hood
750434030756200448 2016-07-05 20:59:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito it makes me upset tbh
750433597656530944 2016-07-05 20:58:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Do you ever wonder if some manufacturing zones were put in place to ensure certain neighborhoods would remain marginalized and poor?
750423129374195712 2016-07-05 20:16:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 @steadyblogging the current zoning on Empire is C8, which is what I'm talking about, yes
750421413631299588 2016-07-05 20:09:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Can't we just get rid of heavy commercial zoning that was created for parking lots & gas stations? It's outdated, not doing anything for us
750410810661412864 2016-07-05 19:27:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder and already garb
750410684433887233 2016-07-05 19:27:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder didn't even know they had an app
750409807421661184 2016-07-05 19:23:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro shane.
750409667059351552 2016-07-05 19:23:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emmaroller also i have a friend who made her low-paying internships work by managing a restaurant on the weekends
750407424566292480 2016-07-05 19:14:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emmaroller same!! that real journalism struggle. $10/hr, what bullshit
750407030704369664 2016-07-05 19:12:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GueldaVoien ?
750389960226791424 2016-07-05 18:04:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka who knew
750388987680944128 2016-07-05 18:00:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> The FT has millennial readers? http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7e3bb2d6-3e9b-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a.html#axzz4DQmOxGtu
750387330251427840 2016-07-05 17:54:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @JacobGarchik i think that's the point
750373900689735680 2016-07-05 17:00:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @tanzoak i knew a couple dance majors in undergrad! it seems impossible to make a living unless you join a major company
750363579027693568 2016-07-05 16:19:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad cops had blocks off all the roads to the park! super annoying. good thing we had planned to watch the fireworks from the pulaski
750359777771974656 2016-07-05 16:04:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ idk, this is mostly old crap that's been dissed. LES is a high traffic area so you get lots of good and lots of bad
750356457871306752 2016-07-05 15:51:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ nah
750356418897870848 2016-07-05 15:51:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ there is plenty of good graffiti and street art in your hood.
750356093977657344 2016-07-05 15:50:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad did macy's do a ticketed viewing party in gantry plaza state park? i didn't realize they were doing that but i saw it yesterday
750355399707164672 2016-07-05 15:47:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ racist?
750355242118766592 2016-07-05 15:46:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull sigh
750354627682373633 2016-07-05 15:44:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull hmmm what are you referring to right now
750354273163182080 2016-07-05 15:42:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @markbyrnes525 where is it?
750352284022935553 2016-07-05 15:35:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @tanzoak oh idk about dance specifically! but there are a bunch of small, indy orgs on there where i've seen films, etc
750351994779566080 2016-07-05 15:33:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas you know what would be nice is if they could put chargers on commuter rail. i don't need them on buses, dammit
750351366233686016 2016-07-05 15:31:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas so i only watched the end. was this whole press conference just about etix?
750350686295035904 2016-07-05 15:28:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bfishbfish i didn't know this was happening, what technology is he talking about
750348397131997184 2016-07-05 15:19:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @tanzoak i don't think that's really true, at least not in new york. maybe elsewhere
750346743364063233 2016-07-05 15:12:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @tanzoak realistically NEA gives pretty small grants so they make a much bigger difference to small orgs
750344140064423938 2016-07-05 15:02:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman yeah i know 90s eastern europe wasn't the easiest place to be a journalist. where was better? russia?
750343725738553344 2016-07-05 15:00:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @tanzoak if you're paying attention to these tweets, look at list of NEA grants i tweeted at him. they go to mostly small orgs
750343351782768640 2016-07-05 14:59:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman working in hungary sounds fun
750343220253564928 2016-07-05 14:58:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday i try to close all my tabs every day just to lessen my anxiety level
750340546942599168 2016-07-05 14:48:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas thanks!

750339731662176256 2016-07-05 14:45:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ lol you live in the lower east side!

750331689675751424 2016-07-05 14:13:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnJCoyne that's a good question
750329929603121153 2016-07-05 14:06:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> Hm what should we build on this vacant gas station... some other thing people in this neighborhood don't actually need!
750329406720208896 2016-07-05 14:04:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito i worded it strangely
750329314042863616 2016-07-05 14:03:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> So what are the chances this gets converted to a homeless shelter
750329043615150080 2016-07-05 14:02:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito as in why are apartments a better use here than a hotel?
750328811116429312 2016-07-05 14:01:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito why what
750328774852481026 2016-07-05 14:01:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 an armory with residential zoning!
750328408543027201 2016-07-05 14:00:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> Bedford and Eastern Parkway is a pretty dumb place not to build apartments
750328071329316864 2016-07-05 13:58:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> When you keep heavy commercial zoning on a prime resi property in Crown Heights, eventually someone builds a hotel http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/07/permits-filed-hotel-at-1548-bedford-avenue-crown-heights.html
750327180480147456 2016-07-05 13:55:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ exactly! but NEA actually supports a lot of small arts organizations and public art projects. you see it but you don't know!
750321907090780160 2016-07-05 13:34:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> The military spends $437 million on its bandsthree times the budget of the NEA http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/military-bands-budget.html?_r=0

748993810613538816 2016-07-01 21:36:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism ahaha. i only recently discovered i could buy grains like bulgur wheat for very cheap in bulk section of WF, its surprising.
748992600061931521 2016-07-01 21:32:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yea their store-branded stuff is reasonble. believe it or not, cheap way to shop for nuts is buy em in bulk at Whole Foods

748967294601203712 2016-07-01 19:51:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BkCory yeah i kind of figured. drab. http://33and13.blogspot.com/2008/08/inside-brooklyn-masonic-hall_07.html
748964049086447617 2016-07-01 19:38:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BkCory i'm not sure i could swing it but someone a little taller than me probably could. or someone with a decent ladder.
748959603283599360 2016-07-01 19:20:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BkCory have they not started work on this yet? https://brooklynrelics.blogspot.com/2016/05/abandoned-ridgewood-masonic-temple.html
748959092732035072 2016-07-01 19:18:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 @BkCory typical strategy is fill the ground floor entrances with concrete to prevent squatters without fixing the building
748958917636591616 2016-07-01 19:18:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 @BkCory there are still plenty in Bed-Stuy. but it's unlikely there's anyone living in this one since you can't access the back
748958243049832449 2016-07-01 19:15:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BkCory @whynot_31 no evidence to suggest that it's collapsing in on itself, but i have never broken that chain and gone inside, so idk
748957233967427584 2016-07-01 19:11:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BkCory @whynot_31 that's not the company listed on the deed
748954807239573504 2016-07-01 19:01:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BkCory @whynot_31 and to have two vacant row houses on one block of franklin! always stuck out to me. it's 594 Franklin.
748954583045734400 2016-07-01 19:01:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BkCory @whynot_31 unusual bc franklin in CHN doesn't have many traditional three-story row houses that still look historic and lack retail
748952808800608256 2016-07-01 18:53:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @EmilyNonko @ltvsquad that seems like the more solidly backed one
748952528067371008 2016-07-01 18:52:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BkCory @whynot_31 mike i'm surprised you're not familiar with this building; another townhouse on this block was also vacant for years
748951013965590528 2016-07-01 18:46:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BkCory @whynot_31 there is also a recent court order on file, likely related to whatever deed fraud situation is happening. no C of O.
748950539266887680 2016-07-01 18:44:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BkCory @whynot_31 not clear what it is but it looks like a history of deed fraud and tax liens to me
748949781804879872 2016-07-01 18:41:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 @BkCory i thought it was getting less abandoned bc the board came off the door, but sadly no demonstrable progress yet
748949150809595904 2016-07-01 18:39:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 @BkCory i'm sure it's sad

748935093155160064 2016-07-01 17:43:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple if i were an italian immigrant running a biz in williamsburg in the 70s, i would probably have made an ostentatious showroom too
748934102947139584 2016-07-01 17:39:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple tho if you were running a marble company it is a great way to showcase your product, esp back in the day
748933254959468544 2016-07-01 17:36:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> We'll have to accept we missed the opportunity to pay $3500 a month to live in an apartment with mirrored ceilings and way too much marble
748930055565373440 2016-07-01 17:23:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts if I had still been at Brownstoner, I would have been ALL OVER IT
748929792553156608 2016-07-01 17:22:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik perfectly preserved 70s details indeed!
748928983648075776 2016-07-01 17:19:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> I originally wrote this http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/07/revealed-661-driggs-avenue-williamsburg.html so I could include a link to this amazing listing http://streeteasy.com/rental/1690428
748927008722280452 2016-07-01 17:11:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @taylorjwofford that sucks, but  i know you'll figure something out soon!!
748926534552092673 2016-07-01 17:09:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg lololol sweet balaclava
748925771377434625 2016-07-01 17:06:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @hadaly NJT conductors just look at the ticket tho right? or do they actually scan it?
748925550597664769 2016-07-01 17:05:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @hadaly ohhh ok that makes sense because NJT runs the AirTrain too
748924963827113985 2016-07-01 17:03:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay OPPRESSIVELY
748924867844669441 2016-07-01 17:02:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz i thought they had their own in-house comms people
748924683085570048 2016-07-01 17:02:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PittLabs @akgerber maybe partner with a contractor? or someone in the concrete biz? make friends with children of the mob?
748924409256218624 2016-07-01 17:01:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz lol i didn't even know they had real PR people, i guess its a good thing that they're trying
748924209146040320 2016-07-01 17:00:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz yeah
748924057291202560 2016-07-01 16:59:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Wow imagine doing PR for Con Ed
748923680491790337 2016-07-01 16:58:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @hadaly i guess as long as you get on the right NJ Transit train after you get on the AirTrain it's pretty easy
748923410600828929 2016-07-01 16:57:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @hadaly its just airport -> AirTrain -> NJ Transit right?
748922438759673857 2016-07-01 16:53:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @hadaly i've never done it but i'm sure it's not particularly intuitive to get to NJ transit. maybe if i gave her very specific directions
748921556244504576 2016-07-01 16:49:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa how would i die
748921386370994176 2016-07-01 16:49:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> My mom is flying into Newark in a week and I feel like my only option is to go get her from there...
748920362335932421 2016-07-01 16:45:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> Unfortunately seems like renters forced to move mid-lease are kind of SOL
748919992213708800 2016-07-01 16:43:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber @PittLabs Lol
748919740631019529 2016-07-01 16:42:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> Happy to hear that the MTA will cover expenses for the people being displaced by M train viaduct reconstruction https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160630/bushwick/mta-promises-pay-rent-for-residents-displaced-by-m-train-repairs
748918749718274048 2016-07-01 16:38:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> Do Slate and Adam America own most of Fourth Ave yet? http://therealdeal.com/2016/06/30/slate-adam-america-buy-park-slope-site-with-plans-for-130-unit-rental/
748918169553760256 2016-07-01 16:36:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra just realized that's only five years away... weird
748917479557201920 2016-07-01 16:33:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber you should start a business!
748916097492090880 2016-07-01 16:28:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber probs gonna be made of concrete anyway!
748915779060588545 2016-07-01 16:26:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber yeah i think it was a predecessor to precast concrete
748915218378428417 2016-07-01 16:24:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yeah triangular lots are weird.
748915021019774976 2016-07-01 16:23:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber fake cast iron/tin facade revival
748914643821789185 2016-07-01 16:22:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism also you know it's capped at seven stories, not four
748913784996163585 2016-07-01 16:18:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism this is also next to the tiny historic district! i'm sure that has something to do with it
748913072622952448 2016-07-01 16:16:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz i imagine it would still be tough (and outrageously expensive) to do a tunnel for the same reasons...
748912904137678848 2016-07-01 16:15:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz though even back when they were building the subway, rich BK Heights folks complained about explosions shaking their houses
748912693092970496 2016-07-01 16:14:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz Robert Moses gave us so many gifts.
748912072465973248 2016-07-01 16:12:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz i can't tell if you're joking
748911950965407748 2016-07-01 16:11:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> or as @MarketUrbanism would say, "historicist"
748911370859638784 2016-07-01 16:09:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> Shockingly contextual building coming to Williamsburg http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/07/revealed-661-driggs-avenue-williamsburg.htmlpic.twitter.com/r7VIxJZFyP
748908713667354624 2016-07-01 15:58:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @JakeAnbinder it kind of concerns me that people writing about this stuff haven't really been to these hoods. or the Bronx!
748908175211061248 2016-07-01 15:56:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @JakeAnbinder if you feel tempted to group all these places together, go visit cypress hills, brownsville, and Livonia Ave
748907794041036800 2016-07-01 15:55:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @JakeAnbinder brownsville has highest concentration of NYCHA projects in city, often the highest crime rate, extreme poverty
748907619075682309 2016-07-01 15:54:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @JakeAnbinder only like a third of it was rezoned
748907572103671808 2016-07-01 15:54:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @JakeAnbinder also keep in mind East New York is a huge neighborhood that crosses between two city council districts
748907240179064833 2016-07-01 15:52:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @JakeAnbinder the city views Brownsville as a lost cause and they haven't stopped treating it that way
748907142023901184 2016-07-01 15:52:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @JakeAnbinder i don't think brownsville and ENY will have the same outcomes for a bunch of reasons
748906408171757569 2016-07-01 15:49:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @JakeAnbinder Fort Greene is small & kind of weird example since it has a huge NYCHA project with all its attendant problems
748906175979220992 2016-07-01 15:48:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @JakeAnbinder it definitely is. i suspect redlining/low rates of homeownership had a lot to do with it in the District
748905979639689217 2016-07-01 15:47:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexbaca @JakeAnbinder chelsea NYCHA has always struck me as unique because it's considered "the best project" and Penn South is next door
748905264359829504 2016-07-01 15:45:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder @alexbaca i wish someone would do long-term study of the south bronx! and compare it to say, more stable hoods in upper bronx.
748903438940069888 2016-07-01 15:37:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder yeah i always felt like that's who lived there. they are really the working class of white privileged D.C. suburbs
748901916000784384 2016-07-01 15:31:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder D.C. is also one of those places that has a fast growing pop of upper middle class immigrants...
748900900119408640 2016-07-01 15:27:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder sure. but IIRC parts of south Arlington were poorer/more immigrants lived there 20 yrs ago, idk if that's still the case
748900226031837185 2016-07-01 15:25:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder @alexbaca i wasn't really shocked by what was happening on H in Northeast until they built that building with the whole Foods
748900044942745602 2016-07-01 15:24:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder oh oh right yes i thought we were still talking about D.C.
748899767166599168 2016-07-01 15:23:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder hm what do you mean?
748899034295926784 2016-07-01 15:20:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder Exactly! I'm from all over northern VA. but my parents worked on M Street kinda near Dupont, used to talk about the hookers
748897699957731328 2016-07-01 15:15:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder when gentrification comes to PG County, we'll have something to talk about. but that's clearly where people got priced out to.
748897416716353541 2016-07-01 15:13:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder and probably it upsets me more because i am from there and because the planning there was so racist to begin with...
748896842356781056 2016-07-01 15:11:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder it felt like D.C. went from poor and black to gentrified and white in like 5 years.
748896557559345152 2016-07-01 15:10:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder i know, i know! and i live in a comparable hood in New York. but it's shocking because so much of D.C. was so deeply depressed
748894675348619265 2016-07-01 15:02:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder Im totally bowled over by what happened on U Street, gentrification and development wise, after I left DC.
748893037418405888 2016-07-01 14:56:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder and green line! GGWash is right, it would have been another screw you to DC and MDs black hoods
748892520168423424 2016-07-01 14:54:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder would have been a much bigger pain to get downtown from springfield
748702620047568896 2016-06-30 02:19:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK cant even tell which tweet youre responding to but either way I understand
748700253377949696 2016-06-30 02:10:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly v good piece too
748698088689246208 2016-06-30 02:01:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull Nostrand btwn Park and Prospect. Had the sangria drink & enjoyed it http://www.yelp.com/biz/super-power-brooklyn?utm_source=ishare
748697483962900484 2016-06-30 01:59:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> Yes its fireworks you hear, chill, everyone
748696544061362176 2016-06-30 01:55:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull I just went to Superpower for the first time and good drinks but overwhelmed bartender :-/
748696010977927169 2016-06-30 01:53:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad Staten Island, no question
748695500061376512 2016-06-30 01:51:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad wait who? I'm from Virginia and I find this upsetting
748694009921560576 2016-06-30 01:45:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder I have lived in New York City for eight years and BK for 3.5, so maybe I can avoid it for a few more years!
748685577264963584 2016-06-30 01:12:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder no cutoffs and a mesh tank top, ok?
748684950791151616 2016-06-30 01:09:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> Kinda sad that Gay Talese didn't do fairly typical fact checking...
748683947685609472 2016-06-30 01:05:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> Gay Talese disavows upcoming book, Voyeurs Motel, bc he didnt check property records against his source, who liedhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/author-gay-talese-disavows-his-latest-book-amid-credibility-questions/2016/06/30/1fede2b8-3e22-11e6-84e8-1580c7db5275_story.html?postshare=6741467331940184&tid=ss_tw
748683303725699072 2016-06-30 01:03:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder my worst fear! I ignored the jury questionnaires for months but the notices became increasingly threatening
748678920560582656 2016-06-30 00:45:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder you've actually been summoned for duty? Where, in BK?
748673904261079040 2016-06-30 00:25:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JonLemire @carriemelago Ive been wanting to do it too! I have a friend who just did Whole 30 and liked it
748661904705466368 2016-06-30 23:38:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> I took it for two years at the end of college and i kind of remember?
748655780686082048 2016-06-30 23:13:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime oh no!!
748653364808978434 2016-06-30 23:04:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly the rendering was fun, idk if it will look anything like this http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/10/revealed-599-johnson-avenue-bushwick-nightclub-conversion.html
748652523398004736 2016-06-30 23:00:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly they would also need a cabaret license, which is a huge pain to get
748652352022925312 2016-06-30 23:00:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly maybe that guy is the owner or someone on local community board! CB 1 hates approving liquor licenses in the industrial zone
748651241408966656 2016-06-30 22:55:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Glad a cool tenant is finally moving in, and good interview from @timdonnelly
748650824969166848 2016-06-30 22:54:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> Why does this look familiar... oh yes I wrote about it a year ago http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/05/nightclub-conversion-planned-for-599-johnson-avenue-bushwick.htmlhttps://twitter.com/brokelyn/status/748645587403284480
748648790228340736 2016-06-30 22:45:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> I covered Thessalonian Church project last year, http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/04/revealed-thessalonia-manor-affordable-church-redevelopment-at-960-prospect-avenue-in-morrisania.html didnt even know it had a deed restriction http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/nyregion/rivington-house-new-york-city-council-delays-scrutiny-deed-changes.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share
748646655424094208 2016-06-30 22:37:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @woolie doesnt really get any cheaper than brownsville
748643639908249600 2016-06-30 22:25:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik yeah but then you have to have a place to store them
748643098880786432 2016-06-30 22:23:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik probably worse for the tenants than PTACs but better for the developer and the citys bottom line
748635358863171584 2016-06-30 21:52:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bfishbfish of course

748632699234041856 2016-06-30 21:41:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jim_Edwards @mickmuldoon no doubt, but in american journalism we are lucky to get any kind of severance at non-union jobs
748632501283917824 2016-06-30 21:41:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mattbuchanan is this a malt beverage
748631354234048512 2016-06-30 21:36:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also "one week of pay for every year with the company" is better than nothing but still kinda depressing http://www.recode.net/2016/6/30/12069178/for-the-second-time-this-year-ibtimes-just-laid-off-a-bunch-of-people

748244704647585792 2016-06-29 20:00:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @filmsbyAmy people did actually live in 5 pointz at one point, but it didn't seem like a "legal conversion," based on what i saw
748244421800493057 2016-06-29 19:59:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @filmsbyAmy yeah they whitewashed them to kill the lawsuit, which was a dumb strategy and just pissed everyone off more
748244004102410240 2016-06-29 19:57:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @filmsbyAmy unfortunately, 5 pointz was not a great candidate for conversion, but it's sad they didn't care about saving the walls
748243687918927872 2016-06-29 19:56:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @filmsbyAmy idk how much of the art they plan to save, but these folks seem more proactive about doing that than most devs in NYC

748224065773658112 2016-06-29 18:38:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism yeah def still stabilized then
748223233208500224 2016-06-29 18:34:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism i don't know, but regardless, new tenants likely won't know it's stabilized and probs won't get the rider
748223009895424000 2016-06-29 18:34:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism PLUS, how much you wanna bet that building has a J-51 abatement
748222853959516160 2016-06-29 18:33:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism if it was $1500 a year ago and was just raised to $2500, it's likely still stabilized
748222319168987136 2016-06-29 18:31:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik yeah it would really depend on the rent history, but it could still be stabilized since new threshold is 2700
748220665392664576 2016-06-29 18:24:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @woolie with tenant in place its an even worse deal
748220203629162496 2016-06-29 18:22:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ConalDarcy no one wants homeless shelters in their neighborhood, especially unplanned ones

748219920136216577 2016-06-29 18:21:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @woolie i highly doubt it, the rent they have listed there would not be enough to cover mortgage/taxes/cc

748214297663242240 2016-06-29 17:59:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald why?
748213880753643520 2016-06-29 17:57:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @k_vanvoorhees uh yes. I mean the ask is similar to other apartments in the area, high maintenance or no
748213088382521344 2016-06-29 17:54:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @k_vanvoorhees maybe. there are comparable apartments in that area with lower maintenance, but not quite so close to the train

748209805672710144 2016-06-29 17:41:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa i'm familiar with your views
748209714765434880 2016-06-29 17:41:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @k_vanvoorhees high maintenance is pretty common in co-ops
748209006104150016 2016-06-29 17:38:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @OlgaOksman true but I think there is a symbolic quality to buying property too, as she says
748206661463052288 2016-06-29 17:29:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@AlanaMassey is right, you shouldn't have to wait till marriage to own property http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/02/why-im-buying-a-house-without-a-family.html
748205037533405184 2016-06-29 17:22:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ my original appears to be a pretty poorly executed '70s loft conversion. maybe the tenants at the time did it themselves?

748199836487401472 2016-06-29 17:01:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ lots of nicer prewar buildings in this area with better renos, i.e. http://streeteasy.com/building/the-beekman/1405
748198540447457280 2016-06-29 16:56:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur did you make this tweet
748197364377194496 2016-06-29 16:52:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ I mean maybe not for that part of town but its not a nice apt, and for that price you could certainly do better
748197060223057920 2016-06-29 16:50:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro was just talking to someone about how I hate the end of Gilmore Girls bc she gets a good journalism job immediately

748184221026521088 2016-06-29 15:59:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime what do you mean? is the door walled off or sealed?

748179045913858048 2016-06-29 15:39:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees @TedGrunewald you're misunderstanding me. meant it's unfortunate that it's interior landmark but MTA doesn't treat it as such
748172892303679492 2016-06-29 15:14:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism agree, but it'll def be the fanciest project in that area. its so far from completion that it's hard to predict now
748171758465851393 2016-06-29 15:10:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees @TedGrunewald well that is extremely unfortunate, since it's not really open to the public and it's poorly maintained

748162904894111744 2016-06-29 14:35:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TedGrunewald @k_vanvoorhees the old city hall station is not actually landmarked, right?
748162515134255104 2016-06-29 14:33:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple there used to be a lot of questionably converted rentals there. i lived on 11th btwn 8th ave & the park for a bit in college
748161177813909504 2016-06-29 14:28:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple you got a good deal. But Ive heard some people tell me 8th avenue is not desirable (but I lived there and liked it yrs ago)
748160408901554177 2016-06-29 14:25:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @tanzoak @MarketUrbanism fwiw there are many, mostly built during recession, but they're not in huge buildings

748155461527027712 2016-06-29 14:05:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak i don't pay that close attention to new rentals anymore. which building?

748019253819875329 2016-06-28 05:04:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @tanzoak @ISANobody_ dense zoning and they get an inclusionary housing bonus. Bloomberg downzoned LES but not chinatown

747876478608609280 2016-06-28 19:37:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @scb1892 yes, the most noxious businesses are near/along the creek both in BK and Queens. active concrete plants, etc
747876129126625280 2016-06-28 19:35:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @scb1892 @MarketUrbanism and there are inexplicably a bunch of produce wholesalersdisturbing given how noxious some of neighboring biz is

747869516940574721 2016-06-28 19:09:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @scb1892 or i guess these particular businesses he took photos of are 99 cent wholesale places, w/e
747868982020038656 2016-06-28 19:07:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism the parts near the L might get rezoned but i seriously doubt anything will change in further flung parts near Newtown Creek
747868634807156736 2016-06-28 19:05:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @scb1892 he's talking about wholesale construction suppliers. tiles, plumbing equipment, whatever
747867505511772160 2016-06-28 19:01:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism there is a fair amount of wholesale biz with chinese lettering but i doubt they are in the majority
747866688297787392 2016-06-28 18:58:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder i listened to it yesterday!
747865332723900420 2016-06-28 18:52:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i haven't seen that many obviously chinese owned businesses there
747864880603070464 2016-06-28 18:50:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder also seems kind of different from Ted Conover's book, but maybe i just need to read that again
747864735073312768 2016-06-28 18:50:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder i'm like 70% of the way through and reading it in stages, its haunting me already
747864437466468352 2016-06-28 18:49:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> Finally reading the crazy Mother Jones piece about the reporter who went undercover as a prison guard in Louisiana http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-private-prisons-corrections-corporation-inmates-investigation-bauer
747858118516871168 2016-06-28 18:24:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly @DaveCoIon well at least meghan looks v cute here
747857731269312512 2016-06-28 18:22:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Brokelyn @timdonnelly what about those beer cozies tho
747857275440726020 2016-06-28 18:20:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon i know a girl on the social team who is trying to push the old school editors to write more explanatory headlines
747856287250128896 2016-06-28 18:16:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon i hope they aren't burying some of the better stuff just because they can't figure out how to write clicky headlines for it
747855024177422336 2016-06-28 18:11:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon maybe? too bad it seems like they are killing some of the better columns, like Michael Wilson's

747798266239135744 2016-06-28 14:26:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i suspect Austin is probably the toughest place in the state to get anything built, and likely one of the most expensive too
747796695803662336 2016-06-28 14:20:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple also fyi DFW is second only to new york in permitting numbers http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2016/05/new-census-report-d-fw-second-in-u-s-homebuilding-last-year.html/?_ga=1.98926999.806905863.1467088105
747796446167076864 2016-06-28 14:19:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple no one is required to build affordable housing but i guess some people do anyway http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2016/03/new-plano-rental-community-near-downtown-will-include-artists-lofts.html/?_ga=1.98926999.806905863.1467088105
747795425059536896 2016-06-28 14:14:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple really hm how is FW different
747794960171339776 2016-06-28 14:13:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple but they separate one- and two-fam numbers out from the rest so that makes it pretty clear what's being built where
747794759377428480 2016-06-28 14:12:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple their permitting numbers (from the census) appear to be for both dallas and fort worth and likely include immediate burbs
747792999199940613 2016-06-28 14:05:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas no wayyyyy its gonna be done by December
747792483002744832 2016-06-28 14:03:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple it seems like DFW's zoning must be less restrictive than ours if they are permitting so much construction
747792150662873088 2016-06-28 14:01:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas thanks
747792117146226688 2016-06-28 14:01:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> re-upping this for the AM crowd at someone's request; also because it's ridiculous, even by Google standards
747791722210549760 2016-06-28 14:00:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple all because of you
747791441393516544 2016-06-28 13:59:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i want to read the original post piece, is the link not in there?
747785757566320640 2016-06-28 13:36:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> Was looking thru Dallas real estate news last night and found this listing with a guy in a panda suit in every photo http://www.dallasnews.com/business/commercial-real-estate/20160616-photos-in-listing-for-texas-housefor-sale-include-someonein-panda-suit.ece
747783820787728384 2016-06-28 13:28:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @scb1892 FAA resctrictions
747646641780428800 2016-06-27 04:23:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple I thought Dallas was somewhat similar but like had zoning?
747646337617911808 2016-06-27 04:22:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple **property rights
747646174656626692 2016-06-27 04:21:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple well Texas loves prospect rights, so no surprises there. Big cities there barely have zoning
747645069080018945 2016-06-27 04:17:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple maybe! but I think even the most privatization friendly places would be skeptical of that unfavorable revenue sharing arrangement
747635106425147392 2016-06-27 03:37:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple and maybe something less terrible than the metrocard.
747634658741878784 2016-06-27 03:36:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i mean excluding the railroads it pretty much is, but the real issue is that we need proof of payment on more bus lines
747633900634021889 2016-06-27 03:33:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ndhapple i don't really see this being popular for a lot of reasons, so i'm not too worried, but it's a bizarre proposal
747633700326670336 2016-06-27 03:32:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also so many things about this would never fly in New York City
747632855577038851 2016-06-27 03:28:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ yes, disrupting public transit by encouraging people to use Uber! definitely a problem that needs solving
747632560230928384 2016-06-27 03:27:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> So Google wants to create transit apps that funnel more money to Uber, potentially via gov't transit subsidies?

747554833159196672 2016-06-27 22:18:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @scb1892 @MarketUrbanism you need a special permit to go much over 10 stories here, heights are capped at like 14-18 stories depending

747522041515999232 2016-06-27 20:08:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ they were considered housing for the least desirable members of society and reformers saw them as threat to traditional values
747521789979398146 2016-06-27 20:07:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ no, you can't build new ones. the city mostly incentivized their destruction till the mid-80s

747505557037289472 2016-06-27 19:03:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @teamsweeting huh ok
747504269612429312 2016-06-27 18:58:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism I think developers are (1) afraid of being denied and (2) of more unfavorable legal history of bldg emerging during process
747503728861786112 2016-06-27 18:55:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @guan I bet he paid like $200 a month
747502161290891266 2016-06-27 18:49:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @guan @Jesselansner as you'd expect from an efficiency apt built in 1896!
747502040457281536 2016-06-27 18:49:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is what his apartment looked like http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/bill-cunninghams-furniture-fre-149005
747501738794622976 2016-06-27 18:47:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Apparently he lived SRO-style, in a very small studio on a floor with a shared bathroom. Might be called an efficiency apartment
747500959245475840 2016-06-27 18:44:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @teamsweeting they were supposed to be converted to some kind of rehearsal spaces but it's not clear to me whether that work is done
747499889421058048 2016-06-27 18:40:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @teamsweeting i know
747499587234062336 2016-06-27 18:39:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @guan also the photos in that NY mag piece are great. look how big these studios are!!!
747499173872865280 2016-06-27 18:37:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @guan i've been meaning to see it! yeah he moved out in 2010 with everyone else

747491526096322560 2016-06-27 18:07:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @HildaBikes @BrooklynSpoke your condo board approved putting extremely bright lights on the facade? bizarre
747490766063296512 2016-06-27 18:04:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @HildaBikes @BrooklynSpoke yeah when i was googling around the only requirements i saw were about entrance and exit lighting
747485776095617024 2016-06-27 17:44:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman also too much decor from Urban Outfitters
747485633531215873 2016-06-27 17:43:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman i particularly liked the fact that you could sit in the florist shop, but food and coffee is just a little too pricey.
747485009267822593 2016-06-27 17:41:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman how is it interesting?
747484875356278785 2016-06-27 17:40:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chenoehart @abalashov interesting! I think they existed in large western European cities too, not sure what happened there
747484445142298624 2016-06-27 17:39:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman lol why would she be in Bed Stuy?? also Stonefruit is possibly the most precious coffee shop Ive ever been to
747483747981926401 2016-06-27 17:36:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chenoehart @abalashov a decent number still exist in NYC and SF
747482680107892736 2016-06-27 17:32:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chenoehart @abalashov and in some cases, large SRO units can be converted into regular studios
747482534955651072 2016-06-27 17:31:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chenoehart @abalashov SROs have shared bathrooms. Most were built before the city enforced min apt sizes so otherwise not much difference
747476321333305344 2016-06-27 17:06:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale yes soon!! its finished and in the editing phase
747476217809494016 2016-06-27 17:06:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BradyDale YASS thank you
747475021224878080 2016-06-27 17:01:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism HPD also grants most of the CONH applications they get...
747474352015302656 2016-06-27 16:59:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism and even with a CONH, still extremely hard to get financing, there are only one or two banks who do it
747474061249355776 2016-06-27 16:57:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism the main reason people won't touch them is that without a CONH and a correct C of O, no bank will ever finance
747473403955806208 2016-06-27 16:55:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i know how CONH process works and that they can be hard to get. but you can also get one in six months if you're organized
747472695604944897 2016-06-27 16:52:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism also i don't think they're that difficult to end, but they are difficult to finance and HPD's process is challenging
747472097375625216 2016-06-27 16:50:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism the building code was explicitly anti-SRO for upwards of three decades, J-51 abatement sped loss of SROs along as well
747471667732054016 2016-06-27 16:48:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism *they
747471617245208577 2016-06-27 16:48:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism accurate, but the required conversion of most SROs in late 60s, a policy that wasn't reversed till the mid-'80s
747471291570098176 2016-06-27 16:46:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also not explicit, but it seems like anti-SRO policies were rooted in the fact pols didn't approve of the lifestyles they encouraged
747470774085246976 2016-06-27 16:44:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> City only reversed its SRO policies because homeless population became overwhelming and they were legally obligated to provide shelter
747469252551118849 2016-06-27 16:38:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> The city chose to ban a form of housing rather than improve/regulate it...and illegal conversions and scatter site shelters filled the void
747468079848886273 2016-06-27 16:34:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelsoszynski pretty good summary of the history here, starting in like the last third of the piecehttp://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/25/realestate/building-homes-for-the-single-homeless.html?pagewanted=all
747467378456399872 2016-06-27 16:31:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> After researching SROs, I'm struck by how the city encouraged destruction of its own affordable housing stock for decades

746086284825866241 2016-06-23 21:03:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller they haven't wanted to do legal tours since the birds stopped nesting there... now they're trying to "restore the habitat"
746084842295672833 2016-06-23 20:57:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller no i don't think it would be. Moses has been working on it but Parks Dept has kept legal tours in limbo for a few years

745737579769757697 2016-06-22 21:57:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i've heard they have sites picked out but those particular details aren't really public yet. i need to follow up w/folks who know
745736848870416385 2016-06-22 21:54:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas like at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal across the street?
745736621794930688 2016-06-22 21:54:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @JakeAnbinder also EDC is the agency/entity whose money is at play in Navy Yard and Industry City development
745736184442331137 2016-06-22 21:52:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @JakeAnbinder suspect its because EDC has access to much broader range of funding sources than DOT, which is kinda strapped
745735661748129792 2016-06-22 21:50:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas where would they put the terminal in sunset park again?
745734364290498561 2016-06-22 21:45:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @JakeAnbinder weird that EDC is running two of the city's major transit plans. or not, i guess?
745733422195277824 2016-06-22 21:41:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @JakeAnbinder to her credit, Alicia Glen has been pretty upfront about the fact that its about getting return on city investments
745733091478626304 2016-06-22 21:39:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @JakeAnbinder yeah that argument has always always been dumb since they cant guarantee free transfers or fare parity
745732386290339840 2016-06-22 21:37:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @JakeAnbinder i mean it's not illogical on the city's part because they do have investments along the route...
745729208299708416 2016-06-22 21:24:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad wow that is crazy. moses sent me the story.

745718086544797696 2016-06-22 20:40:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith @DaveCoIon reasonable! maybe stabilized? def make sure you get that rider on the lease if so
745715755514224640 2016-06-22 20:31:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TheStalwart is it shelf stable? Frozen? That ambiguity disturbs me
745708755506106368 2016-06-22 20:03:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ohhleary @2AvSagas @BrooklynSpoke oh guess that's an issue if you live in Park Slope. no lanes on Washington till you hit Atlantic either
745705528937021440 2016-06-22 19:50:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ohhleary @BrooklynSpoke @2AvSagas yeah that sounds right, but past Atlantic you're taking your life into your own hands
745705194848129024 2016-06-22 19:49:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ohhleary @2AvSagas @BrooklynSpoke isnt there already a bike lane on part of Vanderbilt? or does my memory deceive me?
745704092278886400 2016-06-22 19:44:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly it'll only be effective if they're delaying important votes, so idk
745702092040470529 2016-06-22 19:36:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly it's similar to a filibuster, but you're not allowed to filibuster in the House (only the Senate), so this is the closest you get
745701574555615233 2016-06-22 19:34:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad no, but i wish i could
745700418999685124 2016-06-22 19:30:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly i love politics in eastern europe

745695548104138752 2016-06-22 19:10:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just got a press release about the opening of the Church of Scientology's new movie studio in Hollywood, so that's where we're at today

745672805568647168 2016-06-22 17:40:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@melissagira is running @thebafflermag twitter and holding an interesting discussion on sex work/gentrification/zoning
745672060899303424 2016-06-22 17:37:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thebafflermag AFAIK similar to what happened in New York..
745671360953851904 2016-06-22 17:34:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thebafflermag seems likely. i've noticed that - if we're talking about stripping - those businesses can only afford industrial zones
745670859248009216 2016-06-22 17:32:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thebafflermag agree! they work against the interests of a lot of disenfranchised people. i also think strip clubs are being priced out
745670164356665345 2016-06-22 17:29:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thebafflermag what do you mean by this exactly?
745669925923065856 2016-06-22 17:28:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @thebafflermag and generally no union protections! ha definite similarities there
745663257097166849 2016-06-22 17:02:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @adamlisberg guess you gotta sell your expensive drones somehow
745661148914139136 2016-06-22 16:54:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @adamlisberg this seems like the most baller freelance assignment ever
745656288743428096 2016-06-22 16:34:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand definitely gonna be dramatic! you're ready for that $700 hole in your bank account?

745654780387799042 2016-06-22 16:28:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand so how blonde?
745635204740579333 2016-06-22 15:11:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katehinds right, i just meant like how is this in any way comparable to ebola....
745634467155435520 2016-06-22 15:08:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katehinds ????
745631608217145344 2016-06-22 14:56:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @yossy770 i know some! but maybe those congregations could speak to that, idk if anyone is keeping close track
745630008283111424 2016-06-22 14:50:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @yossy770 yes i noticed! at least about it being overly sympathetic to the Modern Orthodox side. idk about the inaccuracies
745612968520462336 2016-06-22 13:42:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel yeah, it's clearly sympathetic to the Modern Orthodox folks. i don't really understand why the Lubavitcher rabbis forbid it tho
745607291228004360 2016-06-22 13:20:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> An eruv battle pits Modern Orthodox Jews and Lubavitchers against each other in Crown Heightshttp://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new-york/fight-over-new-eruv-erupts-crown-hgts
745457327562760192 2016-06-21 03:24:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaupeAvenger @sandypsj there are also three abandoned or semi abandoned hospital campuses on staten island! its crazy
745456487854669824 2016-06-21 03:20:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaupeAvenger @sandypsj ahh yeah i was going to ask if it was creedmoor. that's actually in queens, but pretty far east.
745452466188189696 2016-06-21 03:04:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaupeAvenger @sandypsj you're talking about Kings Park specifically or upstate and LI more generally?
745449958342549504 2016-06-21 02:54:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaupeAvenger @sandypsj so are you saying the huge abandoned hospital on LI hasnt been redeveloped just bc the town doesnt want it
745449082529812480 2016-06-21 02:51:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sandypsj like abandoned industrial properties upstate, I think mix of isolation, cost of demo, depressed towns makes sites unattractive
745448284454555648 2016-06-21 02:48:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sandypsj there are so many abandoned state owned psych hospitals in New York. Either the property is v poorly managed or no one wants it
745446957091414016 2016-06-21 02:42:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @stateofthecity emergency rewriting what?
745405217504657408 2016-06-21 23:57:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith which is to say, who knows how many people are randomly spray painting trash gold out there
745404823525294080 2016-06-21 23:55:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy I think big parts of the Power Broker are about this
745404520973352960 2016-06-21 23:54:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith also I didn't really read the piece when I tweeted at you at first, but the guy who paints poop is actually not this guy
745403983703924736 2016-06-21 23:52:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith lol I don't think so, I think he's been doing it maybe two years now
745403667801587712 2016-06-21 23:50:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith sigh I know this guy and he's been doing it for quite some time now

745392437338726400 2016-06-21 23:06:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader technically LA traffic is worse, followed by DC traffic and the New York (I think)
745388557079031808 2016-06-21 22:50:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa @lemonsand if i know the NYPD, not only will they not prevent sexual assault, they'll arrest more for shitty low level crimes
745386590810181632 2016-06-21 22:43:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Ohhhh good more plainclothes transit cops in the subways, just what we need https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/MTALetter6.21.16.pdf

745352346687905793 2016-06-21 20:27:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit true! but it's always been pretty clear how the city treats geographically isolated neighborhood with lots of POCs & immigrants
745351816951504896 2016-06-21 20:24:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday hm seems to be ok up by my house, or at least there is a big break in the clouds
745337053521514496 2016-06-21 19:26:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder are you having fun
745334929232437248 2016-06-21 19:17:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas it seems really counterintuitive that the MTA police are not responsible for the subways
745331264429887488 2016-06-21 19:03:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit also places like the north shore know they don't typically have leverage with city hall, they see this as their one opportunity
745327923511595008 2016-06-21 18:49:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit they're going to fight on all fronts, but most communities know they're going to be steamrolled by the admin on density anyway
745326487423848448 2016-06-21 18:44:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit park land on the old homeport site, a new school, upgrades to their local hospital, better flood protections, new rec center
745325591155585028 2016-06-21 18:40:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit i don't think they're afraid of new neighbors. but its a historically neglected area and they want better amenities in exhange
745324890853617664 2016-06-21 18:37:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also worth noting - I think this is the first major rezoning I've covered where the borough president demanded higher income affordable hsg
745324463328268292 2016-06-21 18:36:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Anyone live in Crown Heights and want to split a CSA share with me? http://chfarmshare.org/summer-2016

745317429350404096 2016-06-21 18:08:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @addysue its like that late term abortion piece that just ran on gawker! crazy classist bullshit
745316964667658240 2016-06-21 18:06:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @addysue that is sad but i guess not surprising. i guess if you're poor and not breastfeeding, it's formula all the way
745316621829419008 2016-06-21 18:05:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @addysue jesus. do insurance companies cover that?
745315982906818560 2016-06-21 18:02:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @addysue oh that's cool, and probably needed in poor central Brooklyn. tho is it costly?
745315461512966144 2016-06-21 18:00:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @addysue milk bank depot?
745314315721379842 2016-06-21 17:55:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> Everyone hates the concept of a 16-story building, but that is only on one block and that zoning could potentially be rolled back

745313082768003072 2016-06-21 17:51:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> I wrote about how everyone on SI's North Shore hates this upcoming rezoning. And yes, it's always about parking. http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/06/staten-islands-north-shore-questions-a-rezoning-along-bay-street.html
745309315716812800 2016-06-21 17:36:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alanalevinson i still have no idea what this is actually about
745307205545623553 2016-06-21 17:27:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford thank you! good to know people out there who don't do real estate appreciate my wonky zoning coverage
745306560977604608 2016-06-21 17:25:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford lol
745305869546622976 2016-06-21 17:22:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JMAGuilford one of the car guys at jalopnik came from mergermarket, so you're not the only one!
745302746560073728 2016-06-21 17:09:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> Finally read this cool story on discovering old NYPD surveillance files of political  groups, like the Young Lords http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/nyregion/old-new-york-police-surveillance-is-found-forcing-big-brother-out-of-hiding.html?emc=edit_th_20160617&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=72070020&_r=0&referer=

745299079773687808 2016-06-21 16:55:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @epngo wonder if it has anything to do with that new profile of Hope Hicks
745293249343004672 2016-06-21 16:32:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad control i figured you would know. is this klops thing from 2014ish?
745291314267324416 2016-06-21 16:24:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit and that is generally not the case on the UWS or in the Slope, for example! (where people HISS during public meetings)
745290399414099968 2016-06-21 16:20:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit one of the things i like about SI is that they are just so happy to get any kind of coverage that they are nice to you
745289748521095169 2016-06-21 16:18:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit i have been to public meetings in all five boroughs, and have to say, the North Shore people were some of the nicest
745289407457038336 2016-06-21 16:16:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit i assume that's why you're giving me a hard time!
745288913590362112 2016-06-21 16:14:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit you can't just ignore the systemic problems that exist on SI & pretend they'll resolve themselves if we just build less parking
745288691971670017 2016-06-21 16:14:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit i think the north shore and UWS is a pretty bad comparison honestly. you can't treat all hoods the same

745282587350949888 2016-06-21 15:49:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ssdai $600!!! still
745282166062460928 2016-06-21 15:48:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ssdai would definitely go with the "buy my friends beer and pizza" moving strategy, as i have in years past
745282054947016704 2016-06-21 15:47:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ssdai wtf
745276203687378946 2016-06-21 15:24:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit except the public transit on UWS is fine and you don't need a car
745270990314307584 2016-06-21 15:03:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit also anecdotally, clearly a lot of people living in those homes in Stapleton/Tompkinsville own cars and park on the street
745269008249790464 2016-06-21 14:55:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit they're still very concerned about parking

744968298899595264 2016-06-20 19:00:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @MosesNYC from WSJ http://www.wsj.com/articles/state-law-on-mta-zoning-exemption-irks-local-governments-1465293601 and the text I linked to in the prev tweetpic.twitter.com/IgBz77ZXE9
744967118475640832 2016-06-20 18:56:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV so basically just like every other thing the Port Authority has ever done
744966624877350912 2016-06-20 18:54:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @MosesNYC hmmm ok i think they voted to repeal the MTA thing http://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A10421&term=&Summary=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2015/s8037/amendment/original
744963840346062848 2016-06-20 18:43:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC @MarketUrbanism MTA law was passed in April, and I don't think its been repealed. residential FAR cap bill was pulled last week
744961700865150977 2016-06-20 18:34:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC @MarketUrbanism yeah but what else would he be referring to? allowing MTA to override the zoning is obviously not protecting it
744961244206141440 2016-06-20 18:32:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC @MarketUrbanism talking about the bill that would have removed the residential FAR cap?

744923959590813696 2016-06-20 16:04:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber hm true, but IMO gunshots usually aren't as loud. i heard it all the way over on bedford avenue, and i think it was on nostrand
744915799203319808 2016-06-20 15:32:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC I am into this uneven hand carved sign
744915061400018944 2016-06-20 15:29:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ so are you saying that women are actually less likely to fall off the ladder?
744914564618293248 2016-06-20 15:27:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ what?
744912050103685120 2016-06-20 15:17:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK oh these were at like 9 pm last night. i think anyone who's lived here for a while knows folks shoot off fireworks in the summer.
744910795335675905 2016-06-20 15:12:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReanaMK yeah but you could see the fireworks if you paid attention! and there were a bunch of them, IMO it was kind of obvious what it was

744746742306996224 2016-06-19 04:20:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller yeah! think it's the same kind of thing they have on top of One57
744731514345238528 2016-06-19 03:20:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @alon_levy looks like TLC caps weekly lease rates but drivers could potentially work out a diff deal http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/industry/lease_pilot.shtml
744729665374457856 2016-06-19 03:12:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @alon_levy yeah i think it's a weekly or monthly fee. extra expenses for the car/fixing it are often on the driver
744729377754189825 2016-06-19 03:11:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ or maybe it really is just broken! took a long time for cabs in NYC to universally have credit card readers anyway
744728850387570688 2016-06-19 03:09:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ it was a yellow cab? or a livery?

744644669531893760 2016-06-19 21:34:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CoreyinNYC @epc i've updated this since it first went up; NYCHA says this deal was struck in '06 (as part of rezoning) but stalled in '08

743304701433643009 2016-06-15 04:50:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JoeTacopino I think they meant particularly people who worked the "graveyard shift" (10 to 6?)

743303259524259840 2016-06-15 04:44:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JoeTacopino the old school guys at the Daily News told me people get weird when they work the night shift
743302931693244417 2016-06-15 04:43:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj idk, they just tell you to move your backpack near the dog (???)
743302600611639296 2016-06-15 04:42:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JoeTacopino Joe when do you sleep
743302521163124736 2016-06-15 04:41:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj they are cute tho!
743302080689954816 2016-06-15 04:40:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> Are the dogs on the SI ferry sniffing for drugs or explosives (or both?)?

743255399017623552 2016-06-15 01:34:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @keller_jd important to be accessible! People don't understand planning jargon
743230921982246912 2016-06-15 23:57:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman one lady here said "in staten island, they aim for you when you're on a bike"
743230830793920513 2016-06-15 23:56:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> At the very least, would be nice to have a non-scary path from the ferry to a side street
743230385899847680 2016-06-15 23:55:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> If SI wants people to bike (maybe they don't!), DOT should talk about putting some kind of protected bike lane on Bay Street. It's scary!
743229634796478464 2016-06-15 23:52:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, St Pauls Avenue is pretty adorable and historic. Lots of lovely old houses. That hill is pretty rough to bike up though.
743229011405443073 2016-06-15 23:49:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> One lady here tells me there is a Little Sri Lanka on the North Shore.  Learning so much about Staten Island today
743220418010615809 2016-06-15 23:15:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> Official from SI biz alliance says crime and drug use is an issue along Bay Street
743218786602463232 2016-06-15 23:09:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat he liked to talk about people "striving for the middle class"
743217231966900224 2016-06-15 23:02:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> Now Oddo is quoting Anthony Weiner
743216907948527616 2016-06-15 23:01:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> And now we're talking about sports, Sting, and Ringo Starr
743215654694699008 2016-06-15 22:56:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> Jimmy Oddo, always with the jokes
743215156906295296 2016-06-15 22:54:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> This meeting is about the rezoning of Bay Street-currently mostly industrially zoned- in Stapleton/Tompkinsville
743214787883073536 2016-06-15 22:53:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> The speaker is just summarizing the EIS; how does this help the audience understand?

743127471151845376 2016-06-15 17:06:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> Cuomo still doesn't care about NYCHA; 421-a has a bill on the floor but is still a hot mess, reports @SallyGold http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/06/housing-issues-emerge-in-frenzied-end-of-session-in-albany-102882
743124888299376640 2016-06-15 16:55:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC definitely the latter
743124338627518464 2016-06-15 16:53:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC yes, they have talked about it publicly a few times over the last few years. Hannah covered it recently http://www.brownstoner.com/development/crown-heights-south-east-new-york-hdc-historic-district-neighborhood/
743118386650025984 2016-06-15 16:30:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees definitely
743117721227890692 2016-06-15 16:27:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC oh come on what? the orthodox community opposes landmarking, they own most of those houses, and they have political pull.
743116574274519041 2016-06-15 16:22:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees many churches can't even afford the upkeep on the regular wear and tear of their hundred-year-old (or more) buildings
743116255452860416 2016-06-15 16:21:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees yes it's extremely unfortunate, but pretty common with churches in NYC. the most recent examplehttp://newyorkyimby.com/2016/05/revealed-20-west-116th-street-apartments-set-to-replace-a-harlem-church.html

743115559936610309 2016-06-15 16:18:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC you know why!
743115430923997184 2016-06-15 16:18:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees I think they probably could, but the church doesn't have the money on hand so their only option is to sell to developers

742750420196597762 2016-06-14 16:07:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas has the funding for this already been authorized by the legislature? or is Cuomo just doing this to say he started it?

741324061209460736 2016-06-10 17:40:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @zhanover i just meant maybe not this specific kind of lawsuit but filing for bankruptcy yes
741323151825641473 2016-06-10 17:36:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @zhanover no, but they can slide out of existence through bad financial management. WaPo was in pretty bad shape before Bezos bought it

741280765921624064 2016-06-10 14:48:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> How would you make this building into a school? And how does the city have the money? They better not tear it downhttps://twitter.com/CurbedNY/status/741278899628351488

740628611598815232 2016-06-08 19:36:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak many of the places in your tweets look like they were originally designed in that era

740611822395531264 2016-06-08 18:29:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @smithsj i agree with you on that. but new york state's civil rights law on public accommodations is pretty strict on this.

740597057736593408 2016-06-08 17:31:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes main difference I think is that council isn't weakening the landmarks law, just creating deadlines for LPC to consider landmarks

740590145762648064 2016-06-08 17:03:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj @ISANobody_ I think it's technically illegal but the city should make allowances since it benefits that community
740580507767955456 2016-06-08 16:25:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes and since the creation of landmarks law, landlords have always felt like it completely takes away control of their properties
740580244910923776 2016-06-08 16:24:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes NYC basically invented concept of landmarking. Preservationists started fighting for it after 1890s proposal to demo City Hall
740578297969545216 2016-06-08 16:16:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes why is it weird? preservation has always been a big deal in New York
740575570589802496 2016-06-08 16:05:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Supporters say the law creates transparency for LPC to have deadlines on deciding landmarks, but preservationists say it will endanger bldgs

740243012794601473 2016-06-07 18:04:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity yeah whole point of ghee is that you can leave it out for months. indians have been using it since long before refrigeration
740241947969912832 2016-06-07 18:00:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity so you can just leave your butter out for a month and its no big deal
740241758605463552 2016-06-07 17:59:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity yeah i don't know if it's any healthier. it's also a pain to do. but it does last a long time and doesn't need refrigeration
740241158509633536 2016-06-07 17:56:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity let me know if it's Whole 30 because I think I'm gonna try that one

740196058098204672 2016-06-07 14:57:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> Reynoso, along with Rodriguez and a few others, note that communities of color need more opportunities to calendar landmarks
740195828749479937 2016-06-07 14:56:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> Everyone else votes yes except Reynoso, who abstains bc he feels torn that landlords are the ones who have control over extending deadlines

739903427724095488 2016-06-06 19:34:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kristoncapps understandable, but if the site's currently a hole in the ground (or the former building is still there), worth noting IMO
739902223057072128 2016-06-06 19:30:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kristoncapps i like how FastCo wrote this as if the building already exists

739848223565721600 2016-06-06 15:55:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat @MarketUrbanism it's the same architect as the Meatpacking project. and have you seen this IRL? it is terribly ugly.
739847577785511936 2016-06-06 15:53:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat @MarketUrbanism yeah but look at this modernist schlock the same architects got past the LPC in Sohohttp://tectonicphoto.com/blog/2016/3/22/cnstructio?rq=soho

739828789644042241 2016-06-06 14:38:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jilnotjill they'll probably just run the F up to Hoyt-Schermerhorn or Metrotech and tell folks to switch there
739828281986453504 2016-06-06 14:36:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jilnotjill the G to the A.... and some folks in southern BK will have a long walk to the Q or the D, depending on where they live
739827066430971904 2016-06-06 14:31:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> I guess as long as they are running the 4 into the city through the Joralemon Street tunnel (which is being repaired now?), it'll be ok

738782417096429568 2016-06-03 17:20:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak if it sold for this asking price, current asking rent is less than you'd need to cover the monthly paymentshttp://streeteasy.com/sale/1210827
738781931182166016 2016-06-03 17:18:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 sounds great on a cruise but like why would you have one in an apartment building? so gimmicky, esp when you could landscape it
738781433502797824 2016-06-03 17:16:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bkabak they justify the price because of that large finished basement, clearly. and the backyard

738472278514622464 2016-06-02 20:48:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Is this a joke? Is Tribune trolling us? I can't even tell honestly
738472068497473537 2016-06-02 20:47:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chronotope lol i thought so. there are like a couple sentences about it
738471798908571648 2016-06-02 20:46:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> Someone needs to explain to me what the "artificial intelligence" portion of this press release is talking about http://investor.tribpub.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-releases-details/2016/Tribune-Publishing-Announces-Corporate-Rebranding-Changes-Name-to-tronc/default.aspx

738420320294567938 2016-06-02 17:21:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JakeAnbinder i think if they are just starting the install process, they want to do it at the major interlockings like west fourth first
738419620126806016 2016-06-02 17:18:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes particularly at places like west fourth, which is one of the most complex and old interlockings in the system
738419457014571009 2016-06-02 17:18:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yeah it also mentioned Rock Center (47th-50th Streets) and i believe 50th-8th Avenue. makes sense http://www.mta.info/news-cbtc-new-york-city-transit-subway-l-7/2015/07/20/2058m-contracts-approved-install
738419018655236097 2016-06-02 17:16:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism it was in the mezzanine in between, so idk. could be either or both lines. might be Queens Boulevard line
738418552311549952 2016-06-02 17:14:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> Has anyone else noticed the signs at West Fourth saying the MTA is installing CBTC there and a few other major subway stations?
738401977579802624 2016-06-02 16:08:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 yeah. i mean it would be good to have any decent alternative to IG but no one has been particularly successful/made a good UI
738401710394183680 2016-06-02 16:07:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade staying on brand i see
738401199599329280 2016-06-02 16:05:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 they are really trying to create some kind of rival to IG but.... it always seems like they didn't think it all the way through

738362540145676293 2016-06-02 13:32:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade they charge a 20% fee? i didn't think it was that high
738359901676769280 2016-06-02 13:21:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> Port Authority has permits and a rendering but no developer for this apartment building next to the Lincoln Tunnel http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/06/port-authority-reveals-a-rendering-but-not-a-developer-for-apartments-next-to-lincoln-tunnel.html?utm_content=buffer06da0&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer

738187614591815681 2016-06-01 01:56:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @SoBendito I'm not sure if the Bloomberg Way allows it!
738187309619810304 2016-06-01 01:55:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism that part of Flushing West is mostly industrially zoned

738100548294053888 2016-06-01 20:10:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak a lot of the examples in this thread seem to be about physical systems... what about slightly more abstract ones
738098211307524097 2016-06-01 20:01:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak @robmoorstuff agree! Simon is one of the few who's able to tackle systemic issues like housing w/o being overly sentimental

738076325001494532 2016-06-01 18:34:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GueldaVoien ugh i won't even bother with the DOB. i tried once and it was terrible. DCP and HPD are generally fine though
738075831944253440 2016-06-01 18:32:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GueldaVoien huh i've never really dealt with parks so i don't know! unfortunate if that's the case
738075688511623168 2016-06-01 18:32:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GueldaVoien i've also had widely varying experiences when press people come and go at the same agency. some are excellent, others aren't.
738073853642018818 2016-06-01 18:24:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GueldaVoien gotta disagree, because it really depends on the agency

737766625030574081 2016-05-31 22:04:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn maybe a fancy ice cream truck. i have never seen a standard one like Mr. Softee charge more than like three or four bucks

737639788317167617 2016-05-31 13:40:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_grendan we dont know! The city should reveal its EIS for the site publicly if it has one - the piece notes they were FOILing them for it

736292553629310976 2016-05-27 20:26:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Sorry everyone! Tim has updated: PowerHouse is moving bc Two Trees is more than doubling their current rent of $20K http://brokelyn.com/dumbos-powerhouse-arena-closing-june/
736290255167447040 2016-05-27 20:17:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @khariparson Turns out it is! I'm going to delete the tweet I guess, the reporter made a mistake

736288410751619072 2016-05-27 20:10:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> News orgs: why are we doing the singular "I" in tweetshttps://twitter.com/Slate/status/736285953380208641

736285916126281728 2016-05-27 20:00:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sarahw yeah :(
736285480522764288 2016-05-27 19:58:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sarahw it's very upsetting! but they have a new space in the neighborhood so it's not all bad
736284275880910848 2016-05-27 19:53:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> They are not closing but moving to new space, at 32 Adams Street, that's a third of the sizehttp://ny.racked.com/2015/10/30/9643688/powerhouse-arena-dumbo-leaving-brooklyn-nyc
736283739127459841 2016-05-27 19:51:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter @timdonnelly or they wanted to raise the rent no matter what. if PowerHouse could afford the higher rent, they'd keep them
736283479709749248 2016-05-27 19:50:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter i may be rounding up a bit, but Tim says Two Trees is more than doubling their current rent of $220K a month, so at least $450K
736283090008576000 2016-05-27 19:49:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @hazelcills they are moving to a smaller pop up space nearby
736282953865646080 2016-05-27 19:48:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> One upside to this is that they are discounting most of their inventory
736282465338265600 2016-05-27 19:46:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> Two Trees is also asking P.S. Bookshop, down the block, to pay back $80K in back taxes. If they can't raise the money, they're out too

735933220181708802 2016-05-26 20:38:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism apparently MTA takes abandoned SAS sections seriously since they need to maintain access/ROW, even just to pump out water
735932707889422337 2016-05-26 20:36:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism clearly they have been waiting a long time. you covered the initial filing of these permits (in like fall 2014, i think)

734819320384106496 2016-05-23 18:52:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KonradPutzier IIRC they chose Hudson because they wanted to build the largest library and pay for offsite one too, but i'd have to check
734819215400706049 2016-05-23 18:52:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KonradPutzier they're considering corruption since city didn't take the highest $$ bid.

734760763848527874 2016-05-23 14:59:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik usually commercial brokers keep running lists of this recent sales and listings (referred to as "comps")
734760216953262082 2016-05-23 14:57:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik you compare it to other development sites in the area, using $/bsf

734757815261265920 2016-05-23 14:48:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik you mean the cost of the yet-to-be-planned apartment, not cost of the land? no, that would be wild speculation
734755302566957057 2016-05-23 14:38:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @JacobGarchik might be a little high but not far off from what i'd expect. like $270/bsf

734116647070535680 2016-05-21 20:20:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yeah true, though it did become a defining kind of aesthetic for DC metro system
734115233564897280 2016-05-21 20:14:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism I feel like those tunnel boring machines were a big step in people not dying during subway construction

733403312045862912 2016-05-19 21:05:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC folks are also unhappy bc DOT also wants to eliminate a dangerous left turn at St Johns and Utica while doing the bike lanes
733402929206571008 2016-05-19 21:04:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC some drivers are pissed because most of my street is two-way and narrow, so they see bike lanes as encroaching & gentrifying
733400491368058880 2016-05-19 20:54:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel since i've lived off Nostrand for a while, i always think of anywhere that's an easy walk to Utica "eastern" CH
733400169094479873 2016-05-19 20:53:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel everyone has different ideas, but i consider Kingston the halfway point. maybe albany is "central" if you want to be technical
733399574040051712 2016-05-19 20:50:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel that woman's twitter feed has the exact address(es), but alsohttps://twitter.com/m_m_malka/status/733397148893614080
733398646729871360 2016-05-19 20:47:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel lol sorry i consider it eastern! it's the same place from your tweet i think

733397783735111680 2016-05-19 20:43:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC thankfully i live in a different assembly district, but people are just as against having bike lanes on my block
733396904143421441 2016-05-19 20:40:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BicycleLobby @MosesNYC is this about the one in Clinton Hill? this is getting ridiculous.

733388885372329986 2016-05-19 20:08:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn i recently had someone show me an apartment who pretended to be a broker (when they worked for LL) and wanted a fee. sketchy!
733388169178152960 2016-05-19 20:05:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn the inventor of the app has a point in that LLs and "brokers" screw people by getting them into bidding wars & pocketing fees
733387931130470400 2016-05-19 20:04:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn if you want a coveted apartment, you often have to give "competing offers. having an app to formalize it kinda makes sense
733387668399230978 2016-05-19 20:03:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn yeah i saw this! i can see why people are annoyed but also this is pretty much what happens anyway in NYC and probably SF
733373620165181440 2016-05-19 19:07:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BeyondBlunt why do you say that

733043833819258880 2016-05-18 21:17:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn i think its bc they employ a lot of contractors who don't talk to each other, and it's hard to distribute keys to everyone
733042960925917184 2016-05-18 21:13:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn i think if the public knew how easy it was they would be concerned, lol
733042511699148800 2016-05-18 21:12:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn also highlights the fact that the MTA has no idea what's happening most of the time, and their security hasn't changed much
733042217443549184 2016-05-18 21:10:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn i think the latter! the same often applies to folks who simply trespass in the transit system

732958707303251968 2016-05-18 15:39:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 @JacobGarchik it ignores the needs of most residents. but also doesn't really make sense, given where other Union Markets are
732957889208422400 2016-05-18 15:35:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @whynot_31 honestly this tenant shows a major lack of awareness on AA's part

732948583687806977 2016-05-18 14:58:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik northeastern corner of Bedford and Lincoln was Fox Savoy Theater (turned church); SE corner was a gas station (both demo'd)

732947767576920064 2016-05-18 14:55:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak like i look at their website and i just feel confusion about these items http://www.snarkitecture.com/objects/split/
732946800521383937 2016-05-18 14:51:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak i know someone who works at Snarkitecture and i've never really understood what they do. design installations? weird decor? idk
732941492269031424 2016-05-18 14:30:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harlanerskine the MTA has plenty of already built exits that they inexplicably refuse to re-open (there are several on the G)
732941005859749888 2016-05-18 14:28:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harlanerskine or its possible that they had more exits and then they were closed/demolished/etc. who knows!
732940704977145856 2016-05-18 14:27:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harlanerskine yeah idk about the exits. there are a million reasons why they might not have done them in the 1910s.
732939618723717121 2016-05-18 14:23:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harlanerskine they're a pretty average distance apart!
732939231761469440 2016-05-18 14:21:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harlanerskine as are ones that are closer (18th and Worth Streets on the 6). here closing one doesn't make sense, nor does linking them.

732643156227985408 2016-05-17 18:45:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> if they had the extra rolling stock, wouldn't they be doing something like this already?
732641919080206338 2016-05-17 18:40:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> right, but Church is a small layup and I don't think it has that capacity
732641418288713729 2016-05-17 18:38:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> I dont think they have space to lay up five trains at Church, unless they are also turning some around there

732630235288641536 2016-05-17 17:53:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas yeah i don't know how to judge that, but could be

732629249862029313 2016-05-17 17:49:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka oh definitely. they also have a map of how much they expect population to grow... and biggest increases are on local stops

732628520485171200 2016-05-17 17:47:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman yeah i mean maybe they are trying to use it to lobby the local councilmembers not to do it? idk

732626521060413440 2016-05-17 17:39:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> Unless they increase frequency of F trains, there will only be more crowding/fewer trains at the most heavily traveled stops
732626263874121730 2016-05-17 17:38:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> Reading the MTA report on F express service, i am struck by the fact that this seems like a dumb idea http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/pdf/F_express.pdf

732347496777809921 2016-05-16 23:10:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> Guys, the numbered trains at Atlantic Ave are all screwed up today, esp the local lines. I suspect a switch problem
732346935559004163 2016-05-16 23:08:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas I dont think I knew about the fire though! That explains the big, damaged cabinet of old circuits and switches

732325986214281216 2016-05-16 21:44:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak there is also the question of whether we're talking about hotels made for travels or like residential hotels

732260007228641280 2016-05-16 17:22:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> When it's all about popularity (and the possibility that could translate to money, I guess!), all we get is visual conformity
732257857484230656 2016-05-16 17:14:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @buttermilk1 same price point tho
732257637765632000 2016-05-16 17:13:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> This post is about 500px but it applies to IG and other visually focused social media http://www.naturephotoguides.com/blog/photo-consumption-conformitypic.twitter.com/985tbO1WL1
732257158599954432 2016-05-16 17:11:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @buttermilk1 do you live in the Slope?
732250333641068544 2016-05-16 16:44:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @weareyourfek lol 20 years of writing about wine
732249976458317824 2016-05-16 16:42:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @weareyourfek i see he's published books about it and everything! i guess he had a wine column for house and garden before WSJ
732248424310026240 2016-05-16 16:36:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @weareyourfek jay mcinerney writes about wine now?
732247910209998848 2016-05-16 16:34:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik lol since we don't have enough weird abandoned stuff along the freight tracks
732241019568308224 2016-05-16 16:07:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik it was a Moses proposal and by 1970, the state legislature and the gov had turned against him. likely why they killed it
732239816205729793 2016-05-16 16:02:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik city was also already in economic decline, Moses was in midst of being pushed out, results of his other highways were clear
732238616970301440 2016-05-16 15:57:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik the construction of the verrazano was so controversial that by the 1960s, city would never gone forward with this plan
732237154055770114 2016-05-16 15:51:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik also CSX will never give up that freight row now (they probably refused to then too)
732236408287571968 2016-05-16 15:48:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i probs read about it in the Power Broker? never given it much thought if there are no remnants
732235693762711552 2016-05-16 15:46:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik reminds me i've been wanting to do those flatbush freight tracks again. good graffiti!
732234855791116288 2016-05-16 15:42:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik you couldn't prefab houses unless you knew they were all going to same zoning district, which is unlikely for disparate lots
732234228272902144 2016-05-16 15:40:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik also the city would have to organize this process. all this is part of the reason they got out of the home constructing biz
732231506316382208 2016-05-16 15:29:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik who pays for that? what agency deals with it? where do you store all the damn houses you have to make to justify the cost?
732231210051735552 2016-05-16 15:28:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik right, so what you're describing doesn't make sense for individual townhouses (rather than big developments) in New York
732230190512902144 2016-05-16 15:24:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik not sure commissioning one custom mod house is much cheaper than traditional construction, esp once you add cost of transpo
732227874095308802 2016-05-16 15:15:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik no, you just need architects and expediters who know what they're doing
732227420267384832 2016-05-16 15:13:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i mean there are several companies that do modular. idk maybe some of them do individual projects
732227090880319488 2016-05-16 15:11:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik in any case, if you can afford to buy your land outright, you are not the target audience for city affordable hsg subsidies
732226945946112000 2016-05-16 15:11:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik well maybe if you built it out of shipping containers, lol
732226895920660482 2016-05-16 15:11:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik nope
732225850318426112 2016-05-16 15:07:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i don't know how much it costs to build. but no one paid for that land because it was city-owned and gifted to nonprofit
732225605501079552 2016-05-16 15:06:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik right but the comparison doesn't work in this case because the costs here are further lowered by lack of land costs
732224842158739456 2016-05-16 15:03:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik lol
732224480098062336 2016-05-16 15:01:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik you can buy a five-bedroom house in this neighborhood for $475K! it's very, very different from Flatbush or Kensington
732223808627736576 2016-05-16 14:58:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik Canarsie, southern East New York, Flatlands... majority working class and black. very cheap homes if you have a car
732223070874800129 2016-05-16 14:55:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik also close to market rate for homes in that area... East New York, esp further from the train, is about as cheap as BK gets
732222634797219840 2016-05-16 14:54:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik yes, that's part of the reason Capsys has been building affordable townhouses for the city for decades
732222381389910016 2016-05-16 14:53:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik yeah i was just writing the tweet about this. read the NYDN piece i link to in the lead, all this is discussed
732222226926305282 2016-05-16 14:52:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik those prices are heavily subsidized. single fam reduced from $427,688 to to $235,250, two-family from $616,000 to $415,000
732221098469785600 2016-05-16 14:48:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik you need an architect either way! but part of the reason modular is cheaper is cuz they build a bunch at once
732220642041462786 2016-05-16 14:46:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik there are plenty of architects who can design houses like that though, just a question of sourcing the materials
732214837992931328 2016-05-16 14:23:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> Of course @KELLYWEILL wrote about our local real life superheroes http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/16/new-york-city-s-real-life-superhero-civil-war.html
732211670836219905 2016-05-16 14:10:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa do you have like 50 orson welles gifs just saved somewhere
732211573138325506 2016-05-16 14:10:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaylorLorenz also... Celeste Katz was a metro reporter for one of the major tabloids for most of her career...
732210596444315649 2016-05-16 14:06:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik lol. the manufacturer moved to PA so its a little more challenging, and i don't think they take individual orders.
732209661949153280 2016-05-16 14:02:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ericgoldwyn sadly not mine! but yes i agree with you. i stole it from the architects who designed the first three phases of this project
732209186801618944 2016-05-16 14:00:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik I don't know how much they cost to build. But with modular, it was easier to control the costs/construction time
732208084773416960 2016-05-16 13:56:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> More affordable houses coming to Nehemiah Spring Creek in East New York http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/05/more-affordable-houses-coming-to-nehemiah-spring-creek-in-east-new-york.htmlpic.twitter.com/jAR1l6opyv
732056930840129536 2016-05-15 03:55:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter i think i was just talking to Tanay about the fact that doing this for a living does not make searching for an apartment any easier
732056054389870592 2016-05-15 03:52:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter being a real estate reporter makes it much worse i think
732035347291475968 2016-05-15 02:30:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JimmyVielkind @Cyphran i wonder if Caro actively opposes making it an e-book, so bizarre. but hauling it around is part of the experience
731988535759245312 2016-05-15 23:24:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SarahEvonne @mpventura sounds good, I subscribed!
731988302778249216 2016-05-15 23:23:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mccanner @polly honestly that's how i would describe BB&B. i spent 8 dollars on a soap dish there yesterday and was like... maybe too much?
731985745968304128 2016-05-15 23:12:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly @mccanner trash cans are oddly stressful. why are they so expensive? how much space should they take up in my tiny kitchen?
731984162694008832 2016-05-15 23:06:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaylorLorenz me, probably 50% of the time
731983736066150401 2016-05-15 23:04:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lukeoneil47 Gawker hired one of their freelancers on full-time. idk about Vice etc.
731982833846226944 2016-05-15 23:01:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak except for the logo :-/
731962948290265093 2016-05-15 21:42:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand turns out you can owe the electric company a lot of money and they won't turn it off! My roommate moved out w/$500 unpaid bill
731873215702831104 2016-05-15 15:45:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @flaneur what about drug stores? They do passport photos and theyre open
731873062359011329 2016-05-15 15:45:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime my weather app says no rain till Tuesday
731673905816064000 2016-05-14 02:33:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock right. and the details on the front were added too.

731601436153380867 2016-05-14 21:45:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly oh yeah I've heard about these guys. I think I met one of the owners when I bought their Gowanus comic at MoCCA fest
731597944969891841 2016-05-14 21:31:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly where?

731593551377780736 2016-05-14 21:14:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne also NYU Langone is right next door and has pretty deep pockets
731592672243269632 2016-05-14 21:11:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne depends. Only part of St Vincents was attractive to developers. One of the bldgs was sold to Lenox Hill & became an ER
731590931271585793 2016-05-14 21:04:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne if BI is in fact closing, some of it may be sold to hospital systems with more money, like Lenox Hill or North Shore LIJ
731588017459232768 2016-05-14 20:52:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> This NYT piece about searching for a way to run a marathon in less than two hours is excellent http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/sports/two-hour-marathon-yannis-pitsiladis.html?action=click&contentCollection=Fashion+%2526+Style&module=Trending&version=Full&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article&mtrref=www.nytimes.comq

731352355690708992 2016-05-13 05:16:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle if BI closes, the only full service hospitals south of 34th Street would be NYU and Bellevue. crazy.
731348774992384000 2016-05-13 05:01:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle not sure gossip from a few nurses qualifies as a reliable source, but i wouldn't be surprised if this was true

731264249155162112 2016-05-13 23:25:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> \@patrickdehahn but the rage over the systemic inequality built into the way the city has been planned never seems to disappear!
731264110525091840 2016-05-13 23:25:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn honestly looking at rich people apartments all the time stops bothering you after a while...
731262619265437696 2016-05-13 23:19:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn i don't really do the building tours that much if i'm being totally honest. i like writing about policy more
731262044037652480 2016-05-13 23:17:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn its actually pretty fun! real estate and local news are great, but admittedly not for everyone
731261542239506432 2016-05-13 23:15:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn lol

731242603358916608 2016-05-13 21:59:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees no arguments here. tho whether it will go into Harlem remains to be seen

731236391590502400 2016-05-13 21:35:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @k_vanvoorhees not saying either one of those things. it's just a joke because people were writing the exact same trend piece about it then

731226680270966785 2016-05-13 20:56:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 what is this. and which bar
731226530085519360 2016-05-13 20:56:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jaimealyse yeah there are several with backyards/cafe seating that would probably allow it outside

731222455285624832 2016-05-13 20:39:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand do you have to eliminate tomatoes too
731222323051806722 2016-05-13 20:39:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes @akgerber @tanzoak right, so the issue becomes how do we develop work spaces outside of the traditional business zones in NY...
731222101907124225 2016-05-13 20:38:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik yes
731221925893148676 2016-05-13 20:37:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik about that corten http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/05/33-story-44-26-purves-street-in-long-island-city-rises-past-the-halfway-point.html
731217126132994048 2016-05-13 20:18:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes @akgerber short commutes have long been a luxury for wealthier folks in New York
731216461734248448 2016-05-13 20:16:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes @akgerber idk! i grew up in DC where public transit is questionable & people live farther out so they could afford to buy.
731214354780131328 2016-05-13 20:07:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanKeshet ahahah if only that were true
731214031743266817 2016-05-13 20:06:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes @akgerber and honestly i know a lot of people who would be happy to have a 45 minute commute! that's pretty reasonable
731213535213162497 2016-05-13 20:04:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes @akgerber and the city, rather than acknowledging that by adjusting bldg codes, prefers status quo of making it $$ to live alone
731213270376456192 2016-05-13 20:03:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes @akgerber not saying that larger reasonably priced units are impossible, but fastest-growing segment of pop'n is single people
731212978398347270 2016-05-13 20:02:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> These issues may be an indicator of the fact that few publications keep photogs on staff anymore...more freelance folks working for dayrates
731212344429293569 2016-05-13 19:59:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes @akgerber i'm confused by this tweet. why?
731210866096525312 2016-05-13 19:53:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @johnfekner wow this must be old! classic #wegotkeysforthat
731207400842268672 2016-05-13 19:40:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro you have a newsletter about snacks? this is very exciting
731200316494991361 2016-05-13 19:11:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also people using incorrect lenses that produce vignetted photos. This stuff isn't too hard to fix.
731199757931139073 2016-05-13 19:09:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KaylaEpstein you're gonna livetweet this whole speech aren't you
731199574703022090 2016-05-13 19:08:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko i want to know about wine but sometimes it doesn't agree with me so maybe i am better of for it
731199105175818240 2016-05-13 19:07:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KaylaEpstein lol
731198842465619968 2016-05-13 19:06:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KaylaEpstein wait where
731198687146315776 2016-05-13 19:05:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald i guess the moral of the story is that people will criticize you no matter what you choose to write!
731198562529357824 2016-05-13 19:04:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald on the flip side, i sometimes pick up on this sentiment from creative writers that straight reporting is somehow less worthy
731197272424390658 2016-05-13 18:59:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Now that I know a little bit about photography, poorly staged/edited/lit photos in major pubs bother me just like typos and grammar errors
731196073688088576 2016-05-13 18:55:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes hmmmm would the tiny apts have been allowed in new construction?
731195956868354048 2016-05-13 18:54:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald seems crazy that you can be criticized for "not writing for yourself" while writing personal essays, even if they are for $$
731194714054103040 2016-05-13 18:49:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes is this a conversion?
731194580306104320 2016-05-13 18:49:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes yeah like how they granted a special exemption for one micro-unit project under Bloomberg here. but otherwise no big sea change
731193883682541568 2016-05-13 18:46:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes send me examples! i want to see. i mean like really small tho...currently you can't build smaller than like 550 sf units here
731192583091830784 2016-05-13 18:41:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes and some of the most innovative stuff i've seen is in that realm... modular construction, people renovating SROs, etc
731192435116773376 2016-05-13 18:40:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes like no one wants to hear it, but the future is allowing people to build smaller (hence cheaper) apts
731191335869423620 2016-05-13 18:36:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes hah yeah. but sometimes people do really innovative stuff with less money, because it's New York!
731190873719984128 2016-05-13 18:34:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald lololol that seems like an appropriate response
731190560770404356 2016-05-13 18:33:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald each apartment has its own fireplace, and like half of them have the private pools!
731190521213931520 2016-05-13 18:32:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickrmanes ahahah yeah i guess that's kind of true. sometimes it's interesting, it really depends

731166542495404032 2016-05-13 16:57:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull evergreen tweet
731166186029846529 2016-05-13 16:56:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik while the Wburg project looks like that bc the lot was oddly shaped, zoning was restrictive, owner wanted something "unique"
731165811478499329 2016-05-13 16:54:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik also i live behind one of Eli Karp's buildings in CH. they're designed that way because it's easier to make them passive house
731165166897876992 2016-05-13 16:52:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik i mean the corten, yes. the barclays center made a lot of people hate it
731164586024534016 2016-05-13 16:49:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik also this is the finished New York Ave building.... http://www.helloliving.com/development/hello-new-york/
731163957210255360 2016-05-13 16:47:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik the lot is like 15 feet wide or something
731163882421682177 2016-05-13 16:47:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik the balconies on the williamsburg building are actually rather short by comparison. they angled them to make them longer
731161623570812928 2016-05-13 16:38:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik that's pretty different looking. I'm not sure the finished building actually included Corten at all.
731157369456066562 2016-05-13 16:21:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaylorLorenz ah ok! yeah if people really have a sensitivity to gluten, i think it's great to give it up, but i'm not sure i ever could

730862274823507968 2016-05-12 20:48:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @RKWinvisibleman they also claim this will be an opportunity to upgrade our 19th century sewer system, so fingers crossed on that
730860782968246273 2016-05-12 20:42:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @RKWinvisibleman they're currently considering moving them, encasing them in movable tracts/slabs, and then putting them back
730857562296492032 2016-05-12 20:29:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas apparently maritime law will require a draw/lift bridge which will drive up the cost
730856168449552384 2016-05-12 20:24:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas has to go thru ULURP (a year) and if they are building new bridges, that will involve a few years of eminent domain proceedings
730848237377191936 2016-05-12 19:52:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas if this happens, there's no way its starting in 2019

730762932439646208 2016-05-12 14:13:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism maybe she didn't have a strong enough reason to get the waiver beside wanting a reasonably priced house! idk

730430640609497088 2016-05-11 16:13:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> Historical fencing is suuuper nerdy but it's awesome that these ladies are trying to organize all-women tournaments http://www.villagevoice.com/news/fecht-club-new-yorks-women-warriors-kick-ass-8601021
730429847231672320 2016-05-11 16:10:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jantenen lol they just wrote dramatic copy. Mitch's tours are actually great, you should go if you're interested!

730425594974973954 2016-05-11 15:53:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon @timdonnelly omerta?
730425015510958080 2016-05-11 15:51:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> Instagram made some annoying changes to the app (time stamps!) and made their logo rainbow-y
730424603059851264 2016-05-11 15:49:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly are you making this into a post
730424110296207360 2016-05-11 15:47:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa oh woah the logo is totally different. the app doesn't look that different, but maybe more apple-y?
730423024499998720 2016-05-11 15:43:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade i could put this on my tombstone
730420969530134528 2016-05-11 15:35:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa the non-linear feed?
730412052162949120 2016-05-11 14:59:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday i felt like i needed to look up ice cream places in the hood for #journalism
730410221126979588 2016-05-11 14:52:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade lol
730410025638875137 2016-05-11 14:51:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday totally forgot about this place on Flatbush http://www.yelp.com/biz/kith-treats-brooklyn
730408023903096833 2016-05-11 14:43:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ in this case, technically it is not
730407649439842304 2016-05-11 14:42:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i suspect they scrapped it because CB1 hated it
730407278315245569 2016-05-11 14:40:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism he says they'll still consider individual rezonings
730406732598546433 2016-05-11 14:38:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AdamSchuit @newyorkyimby hey if you have any more info, can you email me rebecca@newyorkyimby.com? thanks
730405684513230850 2016-05-11 14:34:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @mikecherepko yeah NYU dorms were highway robbery
730405293394415616 2016-05-11 14:32:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @mikecherepko housing rates have gone up since  i graduated. guessing similar to NYU's $6K/semester https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/resLifeHousServ/documents/ApplicationsandAssignments/2015-2016AYRates.pdf
730404734247522304 2016-05-11 14:30:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @mikecherepko true! i wonder what they'll charge per student. i bet at least $2500/semester
730404457368948737 2016-05-11 14:29:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko yeah in this case i don't know if i would call it an abuse, legally, but it's not great lol
730404112714567684 2016-05-11 14:28:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko also "event halls" can count as community facilities, which is what allows hotels to do that (i think!)
730403861282889728 2016-05-11 14:27:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko there are a few large hotel projects under construction in north williamsburg's IBZ that fall into this category tbh
730403541232304128 2016-05-11 14:25:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko is it? i think it's an abuse if you don't use that space as a community facility but get the extra floor area anyway
730402480174026754 2016-05-11 14:21:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> This brings up the question of whether developers abuse community facility uses and slide them in to boost their floor area...often yes!
730401552901476354 2016-05-11 14:17:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> Since it's a dorm, zoning allows the developer to build a larger building than would be allowed if this were apartments
730397030556831744 2016-05-11 13:59:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak unclear. but they would have to work w/ universities, so at the very least people would have to pay for housing through a college
730396373502316545 2016-05-11 13:57:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak oh yeah. also they filed permits as an actual dorm. they couldn't build as large if it were just a regular resi building
730394963427602432 2016-05-11 13:51:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Someone is building a fancy, co-living-style dorm in North Williamsburg http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/05/permits-filed-292-north-8th-street-11-story-dorm-in-williamsburg.htmlpic.twitter.com/XuOXNJHhGU

730192273632309248 2016-05-10 00:26:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade I have no idea how journalists write books while maintaining a daily reporting job, but evidently some are able to
730191842080391168 2016-05-10 00:24:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Jesselansner lol that is oddly specific. Also I think I am like five years older than Ally Sheedy is in that movie
730189850629029889 2016-05-10 00:16:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb lol

730188950195867648 2016-05-10 00:13:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade nope! Maybe one day when I have the time and I'm not cranking out posts every day.
730188675607347201 2016-05-10 00:12:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chevon a little much for me personally! It looks a bit too glamour-shot-esque for my taste, but I know it's a standard edit for portraits
730188307540381698 2016-05-10 00:10:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chevon thanks!
730187560857784321 2016-05-10 00:07:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade nah my publisher just wanted us to get headshots, maybe for publicity or something

730118423171235840 2016-05-10 19:32:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sanasaleem i mean that's a specific situation with ethical issues. i've also heard of people reading back quotes or sending transcripts
730117852028674049 2016-05-10 19:30:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RKWinvisibleman sponsored content is everywhere, even if it doesn't explicitly say so
730117266185048066 2016-05-10 19:28:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jillsheller i agree! i guess if they're getting some kind of "exclusive" with a celeb or if there is an ad buy involved
730116470802399232 2016-05-10 19:25:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> Well, my PR roommate says sometimes entertainment reporters say yes to allowing PR folks to look over their stories

729886115608530944 2016-05-09 04:09:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism definitely one for the portfolio
729876695038230528 2016-05-09 03:32:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @facepaulmrevere @rachelholliday i don't think she wants to talk about it, but i am a little pissed and couldn't quite help myself
729875516136816640 2016-05-09 03:27:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @facepaulmrevere and if you can afford a two million dollar brownstone, you can afford privacy if you so desire it.
729874509952647169 2016-05-09 03:23:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @facepaulmrevere i cover housing and planning in NY so i know better than most people! And the Post's coverage was pretty standard honestly.
729873579437924353 2016-05-09 03:19:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @facepaulmrevere i feel like race shouldn't matter! there are all sorts of controversial people who choose to live in new york.

729861156291158016 2016-05-09 02:30:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> Ta Nehisi Coates was a local reporter. I wonder what he wouldve done if hed been in the position of beat reporters who covered his sale.

729768706214137856 2016-05-09 20:23:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC @MarketUrbanism apparently people who live there don't! but i saw it on some maps so i wanted to see what people said
729768435614404608 2016-05-09 20:22:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @jamesfacts i'm sure he masked the purchase. his friend and the brokers were the ones who informed the public
729767902170189824 2016-05-09 20:20:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism no. i'm talking the area southwest of the university but before "university heights"
729767178170449924 2016-05-09 20:17:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @The_BX_Pulse that's generally considered University Heights.
729765175704862721 2016-05-09 20:09:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chevon it's a serious question! my bf lives there/is from there and he says its Fordham so I'll probably go with that
729764864453951489 2016-05-09 20:07:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @The_BX_Pulse check the tweet it's threaded with. I was asking if the area around Fordham is called Fordham or Fordham Heights

729761313413533696 2016-05-09 19:53:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> People who know stuff about the Bronx: is the area around Fordham just called "Fordham" or "Fordham Heights"?
729751324510851072 2016-05-09 19:14:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alexnazaryan people do like to talk about the real estate market like its some kind of invisible and unstoppable hand
729740074334720000 2016-05-09 18:29:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @spollck true. haven't biked as much in Astoria but there seem to be bike lanes on a few main streets. And most blocks seem pretty quiet

729738730580389889 2016-05-09 18:24:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur if nothing else, I feel like I have definitely Accomplished Something after I bike 18 miles
729737382036115456 2016-05-09 18:18:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> The answer is probably no, but I will lie and tell myself otherwise
729735070441934848 2016-05-09 18:09:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @knguyen @chaykak could  be the men's style publication we deserve?
729732661175066624 2016-05-09 17:59:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> Wondering if I can justify not going to the gym by biking nine miles to Astoria like a maniac
729730997072351232 2016-05-09 17:53:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CarsonSieving @SoBendito I guess $1440/mo is not bad for your own room in that part of town
729729561194315776 2016-05-09 17:47:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @CarsonSieving ladies residential hotel http://www.websterapartments.org/rooms/
729729377794166784 2016-05-09 17:46:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CarsonSieving @SoBendito economic in the sense that it's always more profitable to sell to a condo developer, yes
729722876975271937 2016-05-09 17:21:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @alon_levy but i guess we can blame the city for these weird boundaries https://www1.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/tracking/subboro.pdf
729722114639540226 2016-05-09 17:18:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @alon_levy since i think we all know that Mott Haven might be "gentrifying" but Hunts Point/Crotona/Melrose/Tremont are not
729721181725667328 2016-05-09 17:14:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @alon_levy this report is good but the blocks of neighborhoods seem big/overly broad, particularly in the Bronx
729719449490722816 2016-05-09 17:07:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito unless it qualifies as a dorm, i doubt it would fly now. but i think it would be fine if it were co-ed
729719164529745920 2016-05-09 17:06:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito oh you mean if you built a residence specifically for women?
729719066286563328 2016-05-09 17:05:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito what do you mean
729717559096938496 2016-05-09 16:59:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito yeah i was just talking to someone else about this re: Common, SROs, lack of affordable housing for single people
729717060834627585 2016-05-09 16:57:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> And this building is cool http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2012/02/1927-barbizon-hotel-for-women-140-east.html but worth noting it replaced an ornate 19th century synagogue http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-lost-temple-anshe-chesed-lexington.html
729716493429116929 2016-05-09 16:55:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> This was originally built in the 1920s as a residential hotel for middle-class, single, working womenhttps://twitter.com/CurbedNY/status/729715715314454528
729713889227771904 2016-05-09 16:45:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg @lainnafader remember when lots of journos would post their stuff anon on reddit to boost traffic? do people still do that?
729712433422602240 2016-05-09 16:39:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg @lainnafader is there reporting out there on this?
729711423698374657 2016-05-09 16:35:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader @emanuelmaiberg on this particular topic? idk, maybe i just don't pay very close attention to media reporting
729711220538937345 2016-05-09 16:34:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DLHDara @Azi it's been a pretty consistent part of questions about this project. i'm sure we'll hear it from journos and public
729711050023669760 2016-05-09 16:34:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg @lainnafader see that's the kind of thing I'd be interested in seeing in a piece of media reporting
729703878770438144 2016-05-09 16:05:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> First streetcar forum is tonight at the Boys and Girls' Club in Astoriahttp://www.nycedc.com/project/brooklyn-queens-connector-bqx
729702883143389185 2016-05-09 16:01:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader but i am bothered by a typo in the second to last graf - comment/common
729701642795372544 2016-05-09 15:56:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader isn't reddit still a huge traffic driver? seems like it could have some effect

729497115307745281 2016-05-08 02:24:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism correct me if i'm wrong, but the grant applications are the only news in this story?

729439114341146625 2016-05-08 22:33:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @iaivanova lol. i guess the goal is so you don't have to bring them to and from your house. reminds me of how NYU washed my gym clothes
729427284424306688 2016-05-08 21:46:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> Realizing I've seen a bunch of screenshots of this BI piece and none of them mentioned the $100K giant chrome panda http://www.businessinsider.com/cost-cutting-at-dropbox-and-silicon-valley-startups-2016-5
729424037433200640 2016-05-08 21:33:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @iaivanova i'm guessing they mean having people's gym clothes laundered
729416147691515905 2016-05-08 21:02:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kristoncapps they seem pretty ok; the houses seem like a cool idea, maybe sans staggered windows

729383478505156608 2016-05-08 18:52:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ being under investigation or indicted definitely does not disqualify you from being re-elected in New York City

728763305234452480 2016-05-06 01:48:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull I never get delivery from Roscoes so I wouldnt know about that. I always just get it and eat it there, so I know itll be warm
728762933661061120 2016-05-06 01:46:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChristieSmythe her point about starvation mode is accurate tho

728709817251078145 2016-05-06 22:15:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also worth noting that this house as a *hydraulic lift* for your car and some kind of weird glassed-in garage (showroom?)
728707917441019905 2016-05-06 22:08:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @JacobGarchik lol i think it depends on the day.

728705481582256128 2016-05-06 21:58:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay it was not that well-attended either. it was, noticeably, not anywhere near the L train
728705306021244929 2016-05-06 21:57:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik funny. they develop in semi-established neighborhoods so i'm a bit surprised. and as developers go they are also good folks!

728672205375180800 2016-05-06 19:46:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @samthielman i was born after 1987 and i still have no interest in it
728670205598150657 2016-05-06 19:38:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> Some excellent discussion on @lrsphm's piece on the perceived links between trauma and BDSM http://www.complex.com/life/2016/05/who-likes-bdsm-and-whypic.twitter.com/LKYlYohE3j
728667959657431042 2016-05-06 19:29:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm for a subculture that's fairly large, i feel like it's still very misunderstood (with no help from Fifty Shades)
728666576694718465 2016-05-06 19:23:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg @yaeltime i didn't know they proselytized in Ditmas
728666223098134529 2016-05-06 19:22:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg @yaeltime WHAT i am so upset this has never happened to me. the best i've ever gotten was a free menorah
728665246135635968 2016-05-06 19:18:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime you can also make your own challah, believe it or not
728663955233714178 2016-05-06 19:13:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday as long as there are mint juleps, i'd be down
728661632822456320 2016-05-06 19:04:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> And I think last night was the first time I saw the Guardian Angels outside a public meeting. What were they expecting?
728659830181924866 2016-05-06 18:56:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MichaelMartinNY and will the city still do that when they redevelop land inside NYCHA properties? would market-rate tenants accept that?
728659297626894336 2016-05-06 18:54:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MichaelMartinNY i bike past Marcy Projects all the time and see what those lights are like. the city is too cheap to do something better
728658999193784320 2016-05-06 18:53:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MichaelMartinNY i'm saying the type of light is wrong, not that there should be no light at all
728656490748317696 2016-05-06 18:43:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, last night an MTA official said they are rebuilding the M train viaduct because it's been "hit by freight trains too many times"
728655236609511424 2016-05-06 18:38:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> Personally I agree with the caller, if I lived there I would not be happy with flood lights that made my neighborhood look like a prison
728654546235428864 2016-05-06 18:35:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> Mayor responds that some residents want them because they want NYPD to be able to see what's going on in the dark corners of the projects
728654120983375872 2016-05-06 18:34:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Listening to Brian Lehrer, one listener asks about those obnoxious flood lights the NYPD sets up at NYCHA projects after dark
728647761470590976 2016-05-06 18:08:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> Having some formatting issues with this post, but here's the rundown of last night's L train shutdown meeting http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/05/mta-lays-out-l-train-shutdown-options-at-williamsburg-public-meeting.html
728647338537955329 2016-05-06 18:07:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> Only the MTA would host a public meeting where the public can't actually speak http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/05/mta-lays-out-l-train-shutdown-options-at-williamsburg-public-meeting.html
728640598912151553 2016-05-06 17:40:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @MosesNYC the MTA definitely wants the 18 month option because they think it will cost less money and be less dangerous
728598858767405059 2016-05-06 14:54:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak whyyyy is there so much of it all of a sudden
728442950535942145 2016-05-05 04:35:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad did you go to the meeting?
728430020054503427 2016-05-05 03:43:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb unless they are making much better maps, they all need to chill bc otherwise they are just replicating pshark and streeteasy

728404259675492354 2016-05-05 02:01:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emiliesaysthat i doubt it was more than 200 people
728404217212375040 2016-05-05 02:01:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emiliesaysthat am i wrong in thinking journos and officials outnumbered the public? i guess more people slipped in later but still...
728399239374614529 2016-05-05 01:41:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> Thanks to community board meetings, we know that Woody Allen hates bike lanes http://gothamist.com/2016/05/05/woody_allen_bike_lane.php
728395049797570560 2016-05-05 01:24:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> Another reporter pointed out that the L train forum was actually nowhere near the L. But maybe the largest city-owned space they could find?
728394866284171264 2016-05-05 01:24:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> Especially since at least half the people coming out were probably reporters...
728394675623735297 2016-05-05 01:23:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> I feel bad for the radio reporter who had to stand outside that L train forum and catch people coming out for man on the street interviews
728394260735766528 2016-05-05 01:21:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn yeah... how do you feel about using it now
728379787056680960 2016-05-05 00:24:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn it's depressing http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-18/the-humans-hiding-behind-the-chatbots
728379491286962177 2016-05-05 00:22:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn after reading that bloomberg piece about this, i would feel a little sad about using this service
728373331209166848 2016-05-05 23:58:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> In the partial closure option, trains would only run every 12 to 15 mins between Bedford and Manhattanpic.twitter.com/Ea5MWY4cNQ
728370376451960836 2016-05-05 23:46:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_terroirism_ more reporters and officials than the public

728367574791163904 2016-05-05 23:35:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> L train forum is not as well attended as I would hope

728317102323576832 2016-05-05 20:15:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC but did your job candidate actually refuse to come in for an in person interview?

728280131781963776 2016-05-05 17:48:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @2AvSagas that's pretty much what @MC_NYC said to me earlier https://twitter.com/MC_NYC/status/728231948250910721https://twitter.com/MC_NYC/status/728232064399585280
728277642936500225 2016-05-05 17:38:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i mean yeah but besides that, it's always about whether we are respecting the 9/11 legacy, etc
728276498378043392 2016-05-05 17:33:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas also David Dunlap, in the NYT story, says he doesn't think Calatrava would be thrilled by this

728267291058638849 2016-05-05 16:57:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChristRobbins @MC_NYC i'm sensing the beginnings of a gothamist headline/URL here
728266977349910529 2016-05-05 16:55:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harlanerskine however there is a historic district across the street (Astor Row)
728266792892772352 2016-05-05 16:55:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @harlanerskine this property isn't landmarked, but yeah i'm realizing this is pretty chronic in Harlem, esp with SROs
728263640281972736 2016-05-05 16:42:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LoisWeiss you would know better than me, but i thought Trump Tower finished in '83 and the original Gulf & Western bldg was built in '70?

728227590612357120 2016-05-05 14:19:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> "Asked whether he knew about undocumented workers, Mr. Trump said, 'I really still don't know that there were illegal aliens.''"

727931274376155136 2016-05-04 18:41:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> Guys, Leica made a $6000 camera WITHOUT AN LCD SCREEN http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/28/11527274/leica-m-d-announced-no-lcd-pricing-availability
727927850989391873 2016-05-04 18:28:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur @rachsyme i think certain job titles are pretty transparent lol
727927561280475137 2016-05-04 18:27:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur @rachsyme i mean yeah but you know the Times would never admit it to the public
727927160179183616 2016-05-04 18:25:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur @rachsyme i wonder if they have a features editor who specializes in clickbait
727926932222906372 2016-05-04 18:24:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj someone stole my tax ID (idk about my SSN) and made it impossible to file my taxes online
727926699686498304 2016-05-04 18:23:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachsyme didn't you know, with this and the Milo Yiannopoulis piece, it's NYT hate read day?
727926251906867200 2016-05-04 18:21:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj jfc
727926046616633344 2016-05-04 18:21:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj the IRS had a huge data breach that screwed me last year on my taxes so tbh i've realized i can't be too careful
727925539068096512 2016-05-04 18:19:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> Esp after reading this http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-i-hate-security-computers-and-the-entire-modern-banking-system
727925247782031360 2016-05-04 18:17:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Is anyone else concerned by the fact that random phone menus from our student loan servicers and banks like to ask for your SSN?
727924096382685184 2016-05-04 18:13:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz NYT is gunning for all the hate clicks
727915801769082881 2016-05-04 17:40:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @derektmead @sarahjeong i mean this is close to everyone's worst financial nightmare
727904766853054465 2016-05-04 16:56:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 what i really want (or am hoping for) is a camera that doesn't spend five minutes processing my five min long exposure!
727898862548074497 2016-05-04 16:33:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV also, good to know propublica has a sense of humor
727897820565483520 2016-05-04 16:28:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV this line clinched itpic.twitter.com/zDrVRJR5Jr
727897607138316289 2016-05-04 16:28:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 i guess i'll have to rent 'em and decide for myself! i have an older sony nex 5N & people are shocked at what i'm able to do w/ it
727896867430912000 2016-05-04 16:25:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 i've also heard the sonys handle better in low light, which is a big part of what i shoot
727896580116905984 2016-05-04 16:24:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 ah ok! yeah i'm looking at the fujifilm ones and i'm torn between those vs the sony a7/a7ii (but sony full frame glass is $$$)
727895424300896256 2016-05-04 16:19:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 why? i feel like if you can get full frame for the same price, why would you want a crop-frame sensor? just the lenses?
727894953620328449 2016-05-04 16:17:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 really? i have an older sony micro-four-thirds and i'm kind of attached to it, so i might just get a7 or a7II for same price as XT1
727894433690169345 2016-05-04 16:15:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity "that old white dude who isn't Ted Cruz"
727894283156623360 2016-05-04 16:14:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sokane1 it looks super cute. went on a camera research tear recently and saw wirecutter recommends their XT1, but idk if i'm sold on it
727891794005008384 2016-05-04 16:05:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> For something that had to go through Landmarks approval, this building has not turned out well in real lifehttps://twitter.com/boweryboogie/status/727891066251300865
727890664541855747 2016-05-04 16:00:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull for a school with a huge gay/lesbian population, you think it would've been a big issue, but idk if it ever really was
727890274991607808 2016-05-04 15:58:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull fwiw i went to NYU which had the city's first chick-fil-a and never seemed to care about the politics
727889384150859776 2016-05-04 15:55:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull for all his flaws, at least Bloomberg's approach about this kind of stuff was consistent
727888640454610945 2016-05-04 15:52:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg @leahfinnegan get those hate clicks, NYT
727887373988704256 2016-05-04 15:47:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC so this was before adolfo carrion became a developer? i was confused by it until i looked at the date
727854351172153344 2016-05-04 13:36:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Guess the mob is still around, encasing peoples feet in concrete and throwing them in the East River http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/nyregion/mans-body-feet-encased-in-concrete-washes-ashore-in-brooklyn.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&action=click&contentCollection=nyregion&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=6&pgtype=sectionfront&referer=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/nyregion/new-york-today-stealing-an-artful-moment-frieze-art-fair-star-wars-day-blizzard.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&smtyp=cur&referer=
727852498875236352 2016-05-04 13:28:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nicola_fumo where are you going??
727678861543149568 2016-05-03 01:58:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader they have them for all the candidates, it's adorable
727664293597032449 2016-05-03 01:01:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay **in manhattan at least
727660689150640129 2016-05-03 00:46:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @enowakow that sucks!
727659458160168960 2016-05-03 00:41:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ well apparently she was laid off from her job so i don't know how much longer that'll work out for her, given her $$ rent
727658298690940929 2016-05-03 00:37:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull I didn't ask but i suspect it was only one, since it was a converted two or three bedroom
727657812298444801 2016-05-03 00:35:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro she had other vermin too
727657669255958528 2016-05-03 00:34:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter apparently he was like "well if you want to go live in a fancy building with a doorman, go ahead." Oh and they had waterbugs, mice
727657395481153537 2016-05-03 00:33:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caseyjohnston @dannosowitz true! But they could actually run more trains on those lines
727657190580994048 2016-05-03 00:32:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> She said the rent seemed justified because she could walk to work.
727656940592041985 2016-05-03 00:31:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts apparently she even tracked down the previous tenant to ask her about it
727656460604289024 2016-05-03 00:29:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caseyjohnston @dannosowitz I feel like that statement kind of lets the MTA off too easy
727654634605686784 2016-05-03 00:22:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter they got rid of the bed bugs but the whole process sounded horrifying bc the LL wasn't willing to do anything about it
727652751614877696 2016-05-03 00:15:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just talked to a girl who told me her $6000 four-bedroom in Chelsea was a good deal. Apparently it was cheap because it had bed bugs
727617538612465664 2016-05-03 21:55:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn pretty sure it was just the building trades. there were no other "powerful" opponents.
727616200700788736 2016-05-03 21:49:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn oh! clearly not like they used to be
727615862962794496 2016-05-03 21:48:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn what other mechanisms are there to enforce prevailing wage on every affordable housing project? besides zoning and taxes?
727615502017769472 2016-05-03 21:47:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn i mean... REBNY, property tax revenue, and the fact that the mayor's advisors see prevailing wage as 1/3 cut in future units
727614074956156932 2016-05-03 21:41:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn suffice it to say, Cuomo has wasted a lot of people's time
727612988262354945 2016-05-03 21:37:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn they could not build it into zoning without opening themselves up to major legal challenge. unclear how it works for 421a
727612281811570688 2016-05-03 21:34:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn since whole point of the plan was to build certain # of units, obviously admin doesn't want to sacrifice #s for union labor
727611825211224065 2016-05-03 21:32:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn building a prevailing wage requirement into the affordable housing plan opens it up to court challenges, besides the cost.
727610310442553345 2016-05-03 21:26:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn yeah that's what i remember.
727609313943027712 2016-05-03 21:22:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn unions?
727607147845005312 2016-05-03 21:13:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> Fwiw, if you are in my position and don't have a rent history, your legal rent situation is... murky
727606640611082242 2016-05-03 21:11:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> Do you live in a stabilized apt mandated by J-51 that has basically no rent history? DHCR made a fact sheet about it http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/J-51-FAQ.pdf
727562964782419969 2016-05-03 18:18:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @johndelsignore god this whole piece is so depressing
727523076628451328 2016-05-03 15:39:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> Finally finished this excellent piece on how NYPD uses nuisance abatement actions against small businesses https://www.propublica.org/article/nypd-nuisance-abatement-shop-stings-warrantless-searches
727511103970938880 2016-05-03 14:52:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @egscofield i like it because i don't think it looks that much like 1 WTC, except for the fact that they are both glass
727510527036035072 2016-05-03 14:50:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> So glad I'm doing a construction tour in this weather

727483045440266240 2016-05-03 13:00:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mattbuchanan I think those lines could technically support more trains per hour, but the MTA may not have the rolling stock
727480881414328320 2016-05-03 12:52:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> Detailed piece from @ReporterLeslie on how brownfield cleanups workhttps://twitter.com/GwynneFitz/status/727479010998030336
727336324060057601 2016-05-02 03:17:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mattbuchanan lol then they're wrong. half the real estate brokers out there don't know the borders of crown heights either, just ignorance
727335589910077440 2016-05-02 03:14:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mattbuchanan more like you can tell whether the reporter knows where the border is, because it hasn't changed in quite some time
727325972677181440 2016-05-02 02:36:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg lol there are a lot of hunting dog options apparently https://www.google.com/search?q=basenji&client=safari&hl=en-us&biw=320&bih=460&prmd=ivsn&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio1Lun77zMAhVGuIMKHX7hDRsQ_AUIBSgA&dpr=2

727300096375709696 2016-05-02 00:53:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel yup! Ran into Rachel too.
727299923637469184 2016-05-02 00:53:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> Just went to a panel on gentrification and then went to Sweetgreen for dinner, so it's possible I've reached peak whiteness
727298518562516995 2016-05-02 00:47:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SteveInBrooklyn my mom moved to Indiana after 30 years in Northern VA and she just cant get over how conservative it is
727291157470912513 2016-05-02 00:18:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @alon_levy sure but the original piece was comparing IN to "the Midwest" which those others aren't (tho MO is up for debate)
727285569030594561 2016-05-02 23:56:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ interesting! Was waiting for your take

727249022302433280 2016-05-02 21:30:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald a little too stylizedlike bloomberg and ny magfor my taste, but i know he shoots that way bc its what lots of pubs want
727248329923526656 2016-05-02 21:28:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald also jealous of access this photog got. photos are lovely but would be even better if he cranked the saturation down a bit
727247894265389061 2016-05-02 21:26:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald it's good but i wish it had more *historical detail*

727184655603097600 2016-05-02 17:15:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_terroirism_ i mean yes, but it's not a choice i set up, it's one that Cuomo set up
727179218707210241 2016-05-02 16:53:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @budperrone @eliotwb @SallyGold @bdgcongress sure but i don't see any indication of what % were union vs non-union here

727173135691317248 2016-05-02 16:29:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler the lack of transparency is sometimes staggering for a mayor who wanted to make affordable housing his banner issue
727172571389648896 2016-05-02 16:27:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler and like it is often soooo incredibly frustrating trying to extract this kind of data from HPD...
727171465947262976 2016-05-02 16:22:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler ahaha no arguments there. i guess my point was that BdB's housing agencies don't seem as well organized (yet, at least)
727169281356648449 2016-05-02 16:14:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler they sent out press releases with a lot of that info, and you can find it for individual projects. https://www.mikebloomberg.com/news/nyc-will-reach-160000-units-of-affordable-housing-by-years-end/
727166484854759424 2016-05-02 16:02:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler in terms of what?
727165824700694528 2016-05-02 16:00:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> So like what's happening with 421-a, speaking of housing not getting built?

727164605399715841 2016-05-02 15:55:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler definitely! but in their defense, they released data along the way (which BdB's people have not always been good about)
727162928655437824 2016-05-02 15:48:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz who knows what's even going on with the electricals in your greenpoint trap house
727162434516037632 2016-05-02 15:46:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @eliotwb @SallyGold you know i was actually just chatting with a guard on a big union project who told me most of them live in SI, LI or PA
727162080932036608 2016-05-02 15:45:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler the 165K? tough to say. they're not releasing #s on private hsg that left low-income programs either (weren't "preserved")
727160066449768449 2016-05-02 15:37:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL @addysue sorry dudes, that's what i always think of. we had one or two in bobst my sophomore year
727159671795138560 2016-05-02 15:35:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler technically Bloomie did build a lot of affordable housing. but he also did a lot of poorly planned rezonings sooooo
727159424062738432 2016-05-02 15:34:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MaxRivlinNadler i mean this administration is trying to count like a third of those for themselves, so you make the judgement lol
727158792811597824 2016-05-02 15:32:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL @addysue guess it's been a while since somebody killed themselves in there, so maybe it's a little better than it used to be
727158410668560384 2016-05-02 15:30:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL @addysue there was like an extra level of depressing to sleeping in bobst though
727158160025333760 2016-05-02 15:29:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL @addysue i used to sleep on those couches in kimmel and as long as it wasn't too loud, it was great.
727157954437337088 2016-05-02 15:29:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @addysue @KELLYWEILL i also used to go to practice at night and study after so my sleep schedule was never great

727132583717408772 2016-05-02 13:48:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @SoBendito I think since RKO the city has tried to be a little more vigilant, but yeah... http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/03/nyregion/thomas-huang-s-hot-seat.html?pagewanted=all
727130490487115776 2016-05-02 13:39:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @JacobGarchik well there is the story of RKO Flushing, where a landlord dumped oil in the basement (which may have caught fire)
727129641379586048 2016-05-02 13:36:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @SoBendito LPC would have control if this were in the historic district. but if no landmarked bldgs survive, they have no say
727128628430036992 2016-05-02 13:32:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @SoBendito not that i know of... maybe in the 70s, idk. but we all know the city has neglected its landmarked properties
727127871102279680 2016-05-02 13:29:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @SoBendito no i don't think so
727127483590557696 2016-05-02 13:27:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @SoBendito there are no specific rules... it's at the discretion of LPC and the property owner

726920496751755264 2016-05-01 23:45:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @_grendan and they could expand into the lot next door
726920025303597056 2016-05-01 23:43:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito fwiw this building is also landmarked.... that reduces the likelihood they'll rebuild, i expect
726919429532033024 2016-05-01 23:41:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito fire looks crazy but building is stone so the exterior walls will probably be ok... question is whether they keep the structure

726915665613979648 2016-05-01 23:26:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito what about it
726906988987187200 2016-05-01 22:51:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax i wonder how much they are giving each pizzeria to justify this

726894444943949825 2016-05-01 22:01:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism ugh the problem is i don't have an LLC and I couldn't find the person's name in the County Clerk's site
726894037672841218 2016-05-01 22:00:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i tried looking it up using block and lot in ACRIS... is there another way I should be searching for SI stuff?
726893588072779778 2016-05-01 21:58:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism I couldn't find any for this lot(s), idk what to do
726893526877933568 2016-05-01 21:58:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i have discovered it before but I really tried to use it this time and failed
726892747576205312 2016-05-01 21:55:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> Their public records lookup is managed by Xerox, I give uppic.twitter.com/DTyfwV4H5J
726891884803723264 2016-05-01 21:51:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> And unless you know the name of the LLC you're looking up, you're basically out of luck. You can't look up deeds by address. Bizarre.
726891519421108224 2016-05-01 21:50:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emanuelmaiberg the other four boroughs have digitized their public records through ACRIS... no idea why SI persists in this weirdness

725739611054444544 2016-04-28 17:33:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly i also had a flak completely waste my time today, so i am on this boat anyway lol
725739433828470784 2016-04-28 17:32:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly that's pretty much their job! but if you work with really good flaks, they'll find a new angle for you
725737187468259329 2016-04-28 17:23:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak kyle how many of these are you going to tweet
725736729974595586 2016-04-28 17:21:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MsShade lol for a minute i though you meant you were a young Marxist embracing the gulag
725730422844461056 2016-04-28 16:56:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller your mindest isn't always precise when you're being hurried through a site by a dev and architect at 9 am and taking notes
725729261622013952 2016-04-28 16:51:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller i assume it will be as long as they are still installing the facade, which is probably like 60% finished on that one
725727839279058944 2016-04-28 16:46:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller oh wait i think my orientation is confused; it is on the south tower
725726978695925760 2016-04-28 16:42:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller last week the crane was on the north tower as pictured in Evan's post

725405174697725952 2016-04-27 19:24:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith whatevs, workout classes are expensive and i want to do my research before shelling out lol
725401965086257153 2016-04-27 19:11:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith you go through classpass or you just pay a drop-in fee?
725400860809936897 2016-04-27 19:06:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith ugh can't imagine working out at a gym designed to look like the club
725400108540530690 2016-04-27 19:03:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you work in journalism you probably DO earn less than a Silicon Valley intern http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/do-you-earn-less-than-a-silicon-valley-intern
725399384507162624 2016-04-27 19:01:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly @petersterne also thanks for this uplifting piece http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/do-you-earn-less-than-a-silicon-valley-intern
725398889751273472 2016-04-27 18:59:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly @petersterne can just imagine an editor telling you to make your tweets into a story
725398325541912576 2016-04-27 18:56:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne lol @polly
725388719113527296 2016-04-27 18:18:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jeremymbarr lol this also jibes with the way they pay people
725382979535642627 2016-04-27 17:55:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly also - comparing and contrasting this apartment as a rental vs a condo, lol http://streeteasy.com/rental/1476509 http://streeteasy.com/building/382-eastern-parkway-brooklyn/3g
725380048790933504 2016-04-27 17:44:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly a little sketch. this landlord has a history of harassing tenants in the hoodpic.twitter.com/eTusOIZZNx
725379640399937536 2016-04-27 17:42:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly recent rents on units that were clearly deregulated http://streeteasy.com/building/382-eastern-parkway-brooklyn#tab_building_detail=3. and i guess its all condo http://therealdeal.com/2016/03/04/ag-approves-pinnacles-crown-heights-rental-to-condo-conversion/
725379158256267264 2016-04-27 17:40:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly it might still be an apartment building. does the release say how many units total? i suspect it's still part rentals
725378327477891074 2016-04-27 17:37:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly honestly price per square foot is pretty average but not totally justified given how underwhelming the apartments are
725378024233947137 2016-04-27 17:36:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly i meant listings, but i found em. i no longer get press releases for weird random condo buildings in CH (probably for the best)

725334627842424832 2016-04-27 14:43:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith CKO next to the barclays center. dude this seems $$ though https://overthrownyc.com/product/overthrow-membership/. how do you like it?
725332930525052929 2016-04-27 14:37:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith oooo where do you box? i was thinking more like the $135 tier, which is still a lot but not $190.
725332395478634498 2016-04-27 14:34:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith recently got into kickboxing and i'm debating joining classpass but i don't know if it's worth the $$

725329580798652416 2016-04-27 14:23:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @joshpetri they are, but for stuff like kickboxing it's pretty great. biking, on the other hand, is only enjoyable outside on a real bike

725147607090257921 2016-04-26 02:20:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad just seeing this. i feel like they publish this once every six months or just so the NYPD can act like it's doing something

725052578367737859 2016-04-26 20:03:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> WNYC is hosting a panel next month to celebrate the end of their "There Goes the Neighborhood" podcast - tix herehttp://www.thegreenespace.org/events/thegreenespace/2016/may/02/there-goes-neighborhood-way-forward-gentrified-brooklyn/
725046123187019776 2016-04-26 19:37:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @devin_mb idk what was going on in the 90s. but in that washingtonian piece, they said the later hours made maintenance harder
725044786047115264 2016-04-26 19:32:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alon_levy @devin_mb i mean yeah but they don't really have extra tracks anywhere which makes maintenance and re-routing challenging
725044492940787712 2016-04-26 19:30:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb metro had to be built around major interstate highway system, underground utilities... none of that existed when subway was built
725043191414673414 2016-04-26 19:25:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb i guess the irony is it was built largely to serve the car-dominant white suburbs rather than densest (and blackest) parts of DC
725039008976388096 2016-04-26 19:09:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb oh true. and the fact that it doesnt include any kind of express tracks
725036748049358849 2016-04-26 19:00:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @heyfeifer @kasperka i also guess it depends on how we define shit
725030062408515585 2016-04-26 18:33:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb elevated sections in the Bx also built in the 1910s/1920s.. i.e. http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Service_Begun_on_the_Jerome_Avenue_Line_(1917). long story short, most of its very old!
725029166895239168 2016-04-26 18:29:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb parts of JMZ in BK/Queens include elevated sections from the original elevated lines of the 19th century- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMT_Jamaica_Line
725027866820399105 2016-04-26 18:24:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb actually, many of the IRT and elevated lines in Brooklyn were built by 1920s or so, back when it was basically the country/suburbs
725025404952662016 2016-04-26 18:15:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb and the other four boroughs have grown dramatically

724782721067786240 2016-04-25 02:10:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad this guy? I dont really know who he is. hes mainly a photographer who shoots graffiti writers?
724780178803679234 2016-04-25 02:00:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL also none of us know who this dude is. He's clearly just trying to generate press for himself.
724780084301828096 2016-04-25 02:00:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pauldebenedetto @JoeTacopino thanks Paul

724777165980622848 2016-04-25 01:48:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> The minor inaccuracies of how he describes getting in/doing it also bother me, but I guess hes trying to discourage folks from going

723201994865938433 2016-04-21 17:29:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nickmartin this is exactly what i thought! the comments on this post are very interesting if you haven't read them https://medium.com/@jotham.sederstrom/regarding-shaun-king-and-the-daily-news-e458523367ce#.90kx9qb83

723192275560488964 2016-04-21 16:50:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @liamstack we're going to hedge in this lede so we can later say we broke the story
723191895363559424 2016-04-21 16:49:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @liamstack lol this lede - "Someone has died at Prince's estate in Minnesota"

722997958296387584 2016-04-20 03:58:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz @pauldebenedetto oh definitely, considering there's a couple layers of editors at NYDN. he might've just been easiest to fire
722996937524428800 2016-04-20 03:54:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pauldebenedetto no idea. i do know NYDN is not a fan of crediting generally and their CMS is not great, so either could've been factors
722994740388569088 2016-04-20 03:45:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @pauldebenedetto he was totally fine! perfectly pleasant and nice from what i remember. but the tabs do have a way of making editors crazy

722918653826506752 2016-04-20 22:43:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL well glad to know some of them are positive. i'm exposed to a lot of teen boys on IG bc of my particular interests and it's bad
722918314352054273 2016-04-20 22:42:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL @DaveCoIon me & @rachelholliday were discussing how we won't use snapchat & she said "glad we're at the same level of old lady"
722917656156889088 2016-04-20 22:39:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL it almost makes you feel like teens are single-handedly ruining photography, lol
722917563269836800 2016-04-20 22:39:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL i started using instagram again and i'm already annoyed by the level of teen-ness
722916005563932672 2016-04-20 22:33:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller it's not weird at all, IMO. IG users really only like seeing specific things, and so people just post the same shit all the time
722910847622721537 2016-04-20 22:12:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller the narrow range of shots that do well on IG is very boring and predictable. People are sheep!

722892294920097794 2016-04-20 20:58:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i think plan is to do something Industry City-esque but with resi too (which i guess will help subsidize manufacturing)
722891909836898304 2016-04-20 20:57:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism it's city-owned property. they can and probably will pay developers to build commercial and light manufacturing
722891280326393857 2016-04-20 20:54:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i think they are going to do something similar here in LIC http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/nyregion/experiment-on-queens-waterfront-would-mixmanufacturers-and-dwellers.html
722887394186276865 2016-04-20 20:39:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn i don't think that was ever part of the deal

722873134114848768 2016-04-20 19:42:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> East New York rezoning passes City Council 45-1, with only Inez Barron voting no
722869435179081728 2016-04-20 19:27:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> Inez Barron says a significant portion of her community earns less than $15,000 a year, and ENY rezoning doesn't reach them. Votes no.
722864046513516545 2016-04-20 19:06:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism anything that size that also houses low-income renters is likely to already be exempt from DOB fees
722863426809290752 2016-04-20 19:04:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism why not have large (100,000 sf) buildings pay more?
722862828227534848 2016-04-20 19:01:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism
722862260515954688 2016-04-20 18:59:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 wow
722861501439152132 2016-04-20 18:56:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> Less exciting but really important for small landlords - Council just reduced DOB fees and taxes for homeowners and small buildings

722842461333241856 2016-04-20 17:40:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday it took me yrs to learn to modulate my voice when interviewing men - something i didn't even realize i did till transcribing

722608703908790273 2016-04-19 02:11:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lukemayville @errollouis seems like Astoria and Bay Ridge both stronger for Sanders than Greenpoint
722607793786789888 2016-04-19 02:08:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Update to this tweet: Clinton now handily winning much of western Queens, except for Astoriapic.twitter.com/kyIZ1btCpu
722606358546280448 2016-04-19 02:02:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism you mean like eastern greenpoint, kind of around the industrial zone? i think i know where you mean
722605867359694848 2016-04-19 02:00:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism eh not that many old-school polish people left tho, i think greenpoint is mostly about the young white hipsters
722605464006090754 2016-04-19 01:59:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism republicanism: the true mark of someone who grew up behind the iron curtain
722605042310782977 2016-04-19 01:57:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism tbh he seems to be capturing more of the republican leaning old white working class vote

722604387869270016 2016-04-19 01:54:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @4rilla @TheDustyRebel yes, he's also capturing many of the rich, white parts of BK, in keeping with my theory that he has the bro vote
722603934146240512 2016-04-19 01:52:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KayHymowitz and i guess the old white working class base
722602671472041984 2016-04-19 01:47:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> Bernie's basically winning southern Brooklyn, big piece of SI, Ridgewood, Maspeth, Bushwick, Astoria, Rockaways
722598826251522048 2016-04-19 01:32:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TheDustyRebel WNYC is doing a better job of updating their map so far http://www.wnyc.org/story/map-ny-primary-vote-nyc-2016/

722597927403790336 2016-04-19 01:29:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> Sanders is killing it in western Queens, except for, notably, the area around Queensbridge Houses
722597285302050817 2016-04-19 01:26:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin he's currently neck and neck with Trump in Hasidic Bed-Stuy too
722596945328521216 2016-04-19 01:25:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattZeitlin he has 18 whole votes so far
722596191243005953 2016-04-19 01:22:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> Early returns show Kasich is doing well among the bro contingent and Trump is basically winning everywhere else http://www.wnyc.org/story/map-ny-primary-vote-nyc-2016/

722591880417054721 2016-04-19 01:05:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @miller_stephen @dahvnyc imagine an ugly office park built to withstand some kind of Cold War nuclear attack, and you have Crystal City
722591299216519168 2016-04-19 01:02:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dahvnyc @miller_stephen its a good piece! But the millennial quotes killed me lol. Ive also always wondered why the mall is underground
722582487289999361 2016-04-19 00:27:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday guess its 40% press

722547911658237952 2016-04-19 22:10:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn also he never reads his pieces after they're published? c'mon

722532864739438594 2016-04-19 21:10:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Fitz_DC given the current architecture, not sure itll ever shed that sad office park vibe
722532480507625472 2016-04-19 21:09:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Fitz_DC definitely true! There are some decent restaurants now
722531725386072064 2016-04-19 21:06:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> Best things about Crystal City: easy walk to the metro & in case of a zombie apocalypse, you can buy essential stuff at the underground mall

722485309410295809 2016-04-19 18:01:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC so we're talking about "light" manufacturing and resi in the same building? or just on the same site?
722466097308504065 2016-04-19 16:45:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas looks like Second Ave but I guess it could be the 7.
722465479810555904 2016-04-19 16:42:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> I like how this is a photo of unfinished Second Avenue subway tracks https://twitter.com/brooklynmag/status/722464707903401984
722464014404554752 2016-04-19 16:36:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlanaMassey it helps! if you put it in a big bowl and kind of squeeze it in handfuls for a few mins, makes it much less tough
722463737899327488 2016-04-19 16:35:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn @MarketUrbanism jfc all the history
722463365105393666 2016-04-19 16:34:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AlanaMassey did you massage it
722462214377119745 2016-04-19 16:29:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn @MarketUrbanism this is from his speech this morning right? what an odd quote
722428669340356608 2016-04-19 14:16:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> Williamsburg landlord is suing artist tenants for thwarting his sale of the bldg by trying to get loft law coverage https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160418/east-williamsburg/last-sun-umbrella-factory-nyc-wants-williamsburg-artists-out

722418369308319745 2016-04-19 13:35:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @billymeltdown 1133 manhattan occupies full block and there wasn't even much there. imagine the impact on streetscape, losing six buildings
722418069386240000 2016-04-19 13:34:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @billymeltdown the middle storefront is not in great shape. i always thought the apartment buildings looked fine
722417437019389952 2016-04-19 13:31:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @billymeltdown i don't think it's a dump! once a building fills the whole block (and no cute old signs), it's going to feel a lot different
722416240841658368 2016-04-19 13:27:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra so the cost of picking houses up and moving them by barge is actually cheaper than building new?
722415110900330496 2016-04-19 13:22:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nkvenugopal that stretch of Manhattan Ave has some really quaint signage. it really won't be the same.
722414765830762496 2016-04-19 13:21:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> The J.

722405652224679936 2016-04-19 12:45:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL thats a good question. That area on the left isnt supposed to be parking tho.

722129440415879168 2016-04-18 18:27:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @MarketUrbanism are you implying that this is some kind of sponsored content?
722128482394902529 2016-04-18 18:23:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @MarketUrbanism regular man on the street mixed with biz owners and prez of the Navy Yard (didn't they sponsor original study?)
722127681811296256 2016-04-18 18:20:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism he doesn't really offer any reasons (besides parking, briefly), it's just man on the street stuff

722097350932611072 2016-04-18 16:19:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chayesmatthew @MC_NYC basically so the front of the facade will match/go no taller than the tallest prewar buildings nearby
722096671170117636 2016-04-18 16:17:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chayesmatthew @MC_NYC it's essentially following the same lines as height limits. build taller but respect the height of surrounding bldgs
722095690512510978 2016-04-18 16:13:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chayesmatthew @MC_NYC no, like the upper floors are set back from the rest of facade. i.e. top three floors herehttp://ddgpartners.com/projects/345meatpacking/
722094385484197888 2016-04-18 16:08:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chayesmatthew @MC_NYC basically city passed zoning changes in 80s/90s that require a setback after a certain floor in many zoning districts
722092861378990080 2016-04-18 16:02:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC on a smaller scale, yes, and people have. like Stephen was saying, the setback rules in NYC do make it challenging

716746360318476288 2016-04-03 21:57:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> Oh correction: it is the upper unit in a two-family house. But the listing claims it is a four-bedroom plus office

715931465691873281 2016-04-01 15:58:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra and the green in facades! architects are so excited about BIOPHILIC DESIGN. but we won't put plants anywhere but the facades
715927854798802944 2016-04-01 15:44:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra also the way interiors are digitally staged... sometimes real photos look like that if they're too heavily edited
715927680340856834 2016-04-01 15:43:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra the rendering/photo issue is serious! drove me crazy when i would talk to brokers and ask them if anything in photo was real
715925765292998656 2016-04-01 15:36:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra i mean i haven't listened yet but did you say "literally always yes" because i would

715657836840280069 2016-03-31 21:51:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay @newyorkyimby the color/quality of the brick will definitely be a deciding factor, since the shape looks like the rendering

715543137280737280 2016-03-31 14:15:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday it would probably be better as not a duplex. but it was fairly recently renovated, and she hasn't lived there that long
715542641895739392 2016-03-31 14:13:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur there are a bunch of little bldgs under construction on Grand /Classon over there. and the "white castle" building on St Johns
715540688474152961 2016-03-31 14:06:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur and i know you were joking but as a side note - this is new and basically in Prospect Heights http://streeteasy.com/building/622-grand-avenue-brooklyn/301
715538761300488192 2016-03-31 13:58:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur sad part is the condition makes it a million dollar plus apartment, since that's what it'll cost to make it not a trap house
715538262488653825 2016-03-31 13:56:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur can't get new that price in much of gentrified Bklyn. You can easily get older apt in better condition http://streeteasy.com/building/61-eastern-parkway-brooklyn/3g?featured=1

715382122916216832 2016-03-30 03:36:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jbenton I think she probably had a totally normal life outside of journalism and probably ignores most of it
715381700583432192 2016-03-30 03:34:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jbenton is it dark to think we like having a kind of lore that links us back to older journalists? I don't really think so
715381231911829504 2016-03-30 03:32:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jbenton or maybe it's a sign of how much we appreciate having stories that unite journalists as a trade/craft, even if negative
715376230015639553 2016-03-30 03:12:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader it's ok; the pictures make it nicer than it is
715369394734501890 2016-03-30 02:45:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> One of my friends is selling her one bedroom duplex off Kingston in Crown Heights. http://m.trulia.com/property/3229978265-943-Saint-Marks-Ave-1A-Brooklyn-NY-11213#photo-9
715367655033712640 2016-03-30 02:38:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ I do! I make a decent living. But the question of how you do journalism and what the market will pay for is really hard
715291151541149696 2016-03-30 21:34:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday it would only be good if people wrote them in the style of AIM away messages
715282096860880897 2016-03-30 20:58:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BrooklynSpoke @2AvSagas tho i do sometimes wonder if sharrows just make drivers more rage-y and annoyed about your presence
715281917164261376 2016-03-30 20:57:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @BrooklynSpoke lol thanks guys. i would need to read the study since correlation doesn't always equal causation...
715281155537371136 2016-03-30 20:54:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BrooklynSpoke @2AvSagas also since it's East Harlem I bet there will be lots of cops parking in bike lanes
715280659816779777 2016-03-30 20:52:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BrooklynSpoke @2AvSagas sharrows are better than nothing. but there's still like a 40% chance someone will try to run you off the road
715253003499016192 2016-03-30 19:02:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa you know you will
715245268959145985 2016-03-30 18:32:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL this would be a good NYU Local post
715243796154425346 2016-03-30 18:26:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL ooo I forgot about that one. Also the bathroom in UHall has saved me countless times over the years
715243271476350976 2016-03-30 18:24:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL I think mine is finally expiring soon; I'm pretty sad about it
715242999022809088 2016-03-30 18:23:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @NoahHurowitz NYU owes me a lot more than that tbh

715214584978780160 2016-03-30 16:30:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DavidWDunlap is the building being demolished or just cleared out? I'm not sure I caught it in the story
715213907699359745 2016-03-30 16:27:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday you gotta lmk where this is, I don't think I've seen it
715212546240806912 2016-03-30 16:22:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday @mnackem I'm excited to see what happens up here in CB 8. Empire Boulevard rezoning is going to be wild if it ever happens
715212383610863616 2016-03-30 16:21:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism since it's not a building, i'm sure no permits were involved
715212104437989377 2016-03-30 16:20:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> What I'm wondering is how much is the rent on that shipping container? North Williamsburg ain't cheaphttps://twitter.com/hyperallergic/status/715002616439119873
715182770822201344 2016-03-30 14:23:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> Nice @DavidWDunlap piece on the Harlem church where Malcolm X's funeral was held, which is now being gutted http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/nyregion/harlem-church-where-malcolm-x-was-eulogized-faces-its-own-final-days.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&action=click&contentCollection=nyregion&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=5&pgtype=sectionfront&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=99508FA15F347BE05E7E8D3917D70AEC&gwt=pay&_r=0

715018786471088128 2016-03-29 03:32:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ the issue is the tendency to stay up because I'm staring at a computer. The app def helps that
715017930975678464 2016-03-29 03:28:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ even when you're looking at your screen, rather than that over-stimulated feeling that keeps you up too late
715017829486034944 2016-03-29 03:28:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ it does! ideally I'd stop looking at my computer at least an hour before I go to bed, but it helps you feel naturally sleepy...
715016181707628544 2016-03-29 03:21:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> I never would have believed an app that turns your screen orange at night works, but lo and behold https://justgetflux.com/

715009424960655361 2016-03-29 02:55:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity @MikeIsaac @mat IG started getting crappy once they put ads in the middle of the feed. it's all downhill from here!
714991236386463744 2016-03-29 01:42:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ her point is that most of electoral politics is built around white men. politicians always care about your issues!
714990005781995524 2016-03-29 01:37:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emmaroller awesome to see you in the Times after National Journal, btw!
714989854266884096 2016-03-29 01:37:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ I can't tell if you're joking
714986610295771137 2016-03-29 01:24:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> This @emmaroller piece that draws parallels btwn Trump voters & female voters is very good http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/opinion/campaign-stops/the-league-of-mens-voters.html?ref=opinion&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=81161DCF849CC06B53EE69BB84C33816&gwt=pay&assetType=opinionpic.twitter.com/moIAlR5wEM
714973765009014790 2016-03-29 00:33:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> City agencies: barring journalists from event that much of the public can attend won't improve your rep for corruption/lack of transparency
714951398463508481 2016-03-29 23:04:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> The real life Department of Buildings is even more maddening than the online version
714891046229053441 2016-03-29 19:04:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa why
714888590816362496 2016-03-29 18:54:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @K_Liakos oh i think i've seen it, but doesn't it just show the time?
714885420094464000 2016-03-29 18:42:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @nathantempey are they fancy clocks?
714885139680075777 2016-03-29 18:41:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas @Ralphgardnerjr just noticed new NYPD cameras and fencing on the BK Bridge yesterday! what a waste of money
714884827519049730 2016-03-29 18:39:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> There are info kiosks that tell you when the A and F are arriving at Jay St-Metrotech, but it's a lie! They're just telling you the schedule
714884115573682176 2016-03-29 18:37:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> I am very skeptical that functional countdown clocks are coming to the G http://gothamist.com/2016/03/28/countdown_to_gecstasy.php
714882389483393024 2016-03-29 18:30:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> hey @galka_max if you did this for agencies and departments in NYC too, I think local reporters would be grateful! https://foiamapper.com/
714880917693706240 2016-03-29 18:24:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jammy_sod yeah basically how it works is that you have to get 421-a approval from HPD before you start construction
714875958235373573 2016-03-29 18:04:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jammy_sod they've got several months of public approvals ahead, so i'm sure they're banking on 421a coming back before they break ground

714811273700098048 2016-03-29 13:47:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb depends how serious you want to be. i have a relatively cheap camera but it's still much more versatile than most phones

714628568467304449 2016-03-28 01:41:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb I did mine with Mextures, which is much hokier but fun
714628419061944321 2016-03-28 01:41:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb pretty! You either took this with a real camera or you just have a better phone camera than i do

714479078682849280 2016-03-28 15:47:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ljndawson @mikecane @vinbarone then the state will lose a lot of money!

714474310677708801 2016-03-28 15:28:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vinbarone interesting! do you mean the 2/3? or B/Q? The N/R doesn't stop by Grand Army Plaza

714236066266550272 2016-03-27 23:42:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand i'm pretty cheap. i would probably only buy jeans there if they were heavily discounted

713448890633158657 2016-03-25 19:34:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @ejenk @SoBendito then why wouldn't they do all DOT street changes unilaterally?
713446441591705600 2016-03-25 19:24:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @SoBendito except for the enforcement part, all those things require public approvals

713445372580995075 2016-03-25 19:20:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @SoBendito it would be a major change to the zoning code, so you need City Council. CBs don't matter; they're not the issue
713443122152415232 2016-03-25 19:11:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito or the state could step in but lol that's never happening
713441945008345092 2016-03-25 19:06:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito it would have to be handed down via some kind of mayoral fiat, since it would never make it through ULURP/the Council

713379174736650242 2016-03-25 14:57:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka tbh the main attraction of BJ's and Costco are the free samples and the cheap books. that's why i let my mom bring me

713123392468172800 2016-03-24 22:00:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly @jaredbkeller and you're paying more taxes as a freelancer since you're paying Medicaid and SS, which really sucks

713092249345720320 2016-03-24 19:56:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon I also ordered a Miller High Life without getting their shot deal and he looked at me like I was high
713091732225855489 2016-03-24 19:54:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon I once went in there and asked "what do you have on tap?" And the owner was like "Do we look like we have anything on tap?"
713089519273316354 2016-03-24 19:46:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jilnotjill like basically every grocery item

713087364172816384 2016-03-24 19:37:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mattbuchanan true, and also that maybe their experience is considered less mainstream/they have much less voting power than they did
713086474271526914 2016-03-24 19:33:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mattbuchanan it used to be such a big part of politics but they've kind of been swept aside http://nymag.com/news/features/46801/
713081396378603520 2016-03-24 19:13:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DaveCoIon kind of surprised Billymark's West didn't make this list. too well known?
713075153673056256 2016-03-24 18:48:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka why

713063807594205184 2016-03-24 18:03:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also fun how Dave discovers there are still lots of old Irish people in the Bronx, and includes a great story about the Library

713048174244585474 2016-03-24 17:01:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @artichoko maybe it's like the underground tunnels in a lot of old, small cities like Pilsen. Protection against attack/in case of disaster
713047901639991296 2016-03-24 17:00:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax @ReporterLeslie @NYCPlanning Definitely, though a little confusing bc some of the stuff on there is a couple years old

713036940921188352 2016-03-24 16:17:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @artichoko fascinating. i know little about medieval france (and i google translated this). people just carved homes out of the limestone?
713025540819648513 2016-03-24 15:31:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> Would live in a French cave. But I wonder how it came to be - maybe carved out during WWI or WWII? http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/03/tour-a-french-cave-dwelling.html

713021817594753024 2016-03-24 15:17:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReporterLeslie @SallyGold preserved? then that means they haven't added/built any new ones
713018515222044673 2016-03-24 15:03:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReporterLeslie @SallyGold i didn't even realize there was a voluntary IH zone in South Slope. must be quite small, also height limits

712716514416308225 2016-03-23 19:03:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax but yes, it has decreasedhttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150618/east-elmhurst/rikers-population-falls-below-10000-for-first-time-decades
712712706747457540 2016-03-23 18:48:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax I'm sure it's down from '90s peak but since conditions are still terrible, particularly in youth jails, it's not saying much
712711858076127232 2016-03-23 18:45:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy I gather they want the city to pay for a full study, like they did with East New York
712711742397263872 2016-03-23 18:44:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy yup it's definitely up on the DCP website, I have read it and written about it.
712704274485088258 2016-03-23 18:15:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also: this '89 piece from NYT on the prison barge. So many quotes! DOC does not give this kind of access anymore http://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/30/nyregion/for-inmates-the-living-is-easier-on-love-boat.html

712703660338319360 2016-03-23 18:12:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV i could talk about the issues with BQX at length if i ever see you. the problem is more the location than streetcars themselves
712703091985031169 2016-03-23 18:10:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV i covered some of the nitty gritty stuff here when the admin held a background meeting http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/02/new-bridges-and-financial-details-for-brooklyn-queens-streetcar.html
712702622109720577 2016-03-23 18:08:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Quick correction: I think it's docked off the coast of Hunts Point, but apparently there were plans to move it to Rikers. @RosaGoldensohn ?
712701756770226176 2016-03-23 18:05:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV i agree with her. i almost wrote a take but then everyone did so i didn't bother. i had a LOT of feelings about BQX last month
712700608910921728 2016-03-23 18:00:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> Rikers is so overcrowded that 800 prisoners have lived on a floating barge docked next to the island since the 80s http://gothamist.com/2012/09/20/did_you_know_about_this_floating_pr.php
712698170472579073 2016-03-23 17:50:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV the trash can thing seems cool though, we could definitely use that. if it doesn't cost too much $$
712697727419854848 2016-03-23 17:49:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV idk about bad governance but they are clearly behind New York (shockingly) on collecting data about street-level stuff like hsg

712667091271356416 2016-03-23 15:47:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @WalkPrinceton much less of an issue here since land is $$ and limited. i am just excited to see people building traditional looking temples

712657044944396289 2016-03-23 15:07:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @K_Liakos it's not! it's actually really specifically defined in the zoning text and this rezoning. i know because i read it
712655442304974848 2016-03-23 15:01:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarioMangiameli i think in ads it's generally deceptive, and not all brokers are honest about what it means
712654928188145665 2016-03-23 14:59:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarioMangiameli the majority of renters don't understand what it means or how to calculate what their real monthly rent would be
712654774777286656 2016-03-23 14:58:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarioMangiameli if advertised as the sticker price of an apartment and the ad doesn't explain what your actual monthly rent is, it's not
712653797856817155 2016-03-23 14:54:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarioMangiameli advertising net effective rent is a garbage practice that should be banned
712653402950475776 2016-03-23 14:53:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @K_Liakos like i don't think the Wythe Hotel is going to decide to add light manufacturing and magically gain 10 floors
712653224730357760 2016-03-23 14:52:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @K_Liakos it's not that big an area... the city would only approve the extra density for warehouses or places that aren't developed
712643567890604033 2016-03-23 14:14:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> Since we can't go backwards and protect the manufacturing businesses that have already been displaced by hotels/breweries/clubs
712642897758314498 2016-03-23 14:11:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> A little surprised to see Pratt Center pushing back against the upzoning of North Williamsburg's manufacturing zone https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160322/williamsburg/boro-president-grills-city-on-lack-of-analysis-williamsburg-rezoning

712432527076630530 2016-03-22 00:15:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ i mean the protester was injured but it was unclear what happened exactly. one person did keep yelling "you're breaking my arm"

712404724549558272 2016-03-22 22:24:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @katie_honan are we in astoria?
712404557377236992 2016-03-22 22:24:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito it's because they know the truth about your capitalist ways now

712394647369289728 2016-03-22 21:44:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax of course they were both from SI.

712359227457736704 2016-03-22 19:24:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> Two East New York councilmembers split on MIH and ZQA - Inez Barron votes no, but Espinal (whose district is being rezoned) votes yes
712348705765064704 2016-03-22 18:42:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat IMO the reason HPD doesn't want to commit to even lower income MIH band is bc they want more control over limited subsidies
712347876412760064 2016-03-22 18:39:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat yup with the exception of the "workforce" option

712318008564301824 2016-03-22 16:40:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @jamesfacts tho it seems like if you're converting an existing SRO you have some flexibility on that
712317640790970368 2016-03-22 16:38:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @jamesfacts or do you just mean banning the construction of new ones?
712317579608592384 2016-03-22 16:38:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts @MarketUrbanism AFAIK they weren't exactly banned but there have been a few policies/court rulings that made them tougher to run

712313965645316096 2016-03-22 16:24:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @jamesfacts yes, exactly. SROs that function like for-profit homeless shelters/halfway houses tend to be more far flung

710850521704374272 2016-03-18 15:29:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism it technically is tied to the value of the home but it's capped, so tax can only increase x % per year
710848308030398464 2016-03-18 15:20:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism sigh just realizing i forgot the parking because i didn't see it on the schedule A

710268550783619072 2016-03-16 00:56:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay tbh it is kind of like that
710268294629072896 2016-03-16 00:55:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @WalkPrinceton I've been to the abandoned jail there and it is a really sad place, even by abandoned building standards
710267809339711488 2016-03-16 00:53:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @transbay no like seven people wandered into the middle after I took this. Also it is almost 9 pm in FiDi

710244928014651392 2016-03-16 23:22:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CamBautista or at least, as long as the donut was good. Dough is preferred but occasionally i'll slum it it with other donuts
710244634757369857 2016-03-16 23:21:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CamBautista sounds like a win
710243960812408832 2016-03-16 23:18:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL how does this happen to so many people? i was fortunate in coming in with a ton of credits so at least i avoided this

710227447854317568 2016-03-16 22:13:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro why is Bloomberg trying to edge into the men's fashion content game? this seems pretty random to me

710214467590692866 2016-03-16 21:21:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rewenzo honestly anything would be an improvement on the current building
710211024213975040 2016-03-16 21:07:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC even more dramatic than the AP building (but that was also uglier to start with)

710147586171281408 2016-03-16 16:55:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> What's the best way to get a bike to Jersey City? Ferry? I know there are some rules about taking them on the PATH during rush hour
710147190484832256 2016-03-16 16:54:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro @ptrmsk I can only imagine. cc @dahvnyc on bronx bike lane issues
710143558334939137 2016-03-16 16:39:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @shaneferro @ptrmsk oh man the Bronx has some serious bike lane issues. do you live in the south bronx? Port Morris/Mott Haven?
710140930385448961 2016-03-16 16:29:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @caleweissman @ptrmsk i hate Vanderbilt. I take Carlton if i'm going north and Franklin (sometimes Washington) if I'm going south
710140173141544960 2016-03-16 16:26:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk i got hit turning left from Bedford Ave onto Bergen a while ago. central BK generally tame, but Bedford Ave gets kiiiinda scary
710139643421986816 2016-03-16 16:24:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> Downside: you could still get hit by a bus
710139242819821570 2016-03-16 16:22:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk I just avoid Jay Street and take Sands Street to the Manhattan Bridge instead (or the reverse)
710138749695475712 2016-03-16 16:20:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> Excited about dedicated bike lanes on Jay St! Maybe next time I bike there I won't see my life flash before my eyes http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/bike_lanes_brooklyn.php
710138453623705600 2016-03-16 16:19:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @mattbuchanan @marketurbanism @markasaurus this is unfortunately why there's so much corruption among the DOB inspectors
710137923581177856 2016-03-16 16:17:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @markasaurus i mean yeah but that's kind of how DOB fines work? "pay us the money and we won't shut down your property/site"
710136849847721985 2016-03-16 16:13:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @markasaurus i'm saying they don't always follow up to make sure the conversion is corrected, but they will issue a fine
710136390575587328 2016-03-16 16:11:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @markasaurus right but the DOB will not necessarily force landlords to evict tenants
710135083789897728 2016-03-16 16:06:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism fining the owners and vacating the building are two different things
710133310488449024 2016-03-16 15:59:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC anything would have been an improvement, but this looks pretty good
710133104854360066 2016-03-16 15:58:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC @callanlamb @newyorkyimby yeah maybe four or five stories as of last month?http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/02/sneak-peak-at-facade-construction-update-for-217-west-57th-street-aka-nordstrom-tower.html
710117847528304641 2016-03-16 14:57:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy to what end? to run more frequent A trains to Rockaways?
710116910042640385 2016-03-16 14:53:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ReporterLeslie hasn't this been going on for years? i feel like i was going to meetings about this variance in 2013
710116556353703936 2016-03-16 14:52:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday are you having fun
710116223569240064 2016-03-16 14:51:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy you mean only running the A to the Rockaways and running the local C all the way to JFK all the time?

709929829467037696 2016-03-15 02:30:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader i kind of like Choose Your Own Adventure guy
709849285991514113 2016-03-15 21:10:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb everyone gets excited about how clean the metro is. it's only bc the cops give you tickets for having food or water
709848702962286593 2016-03-15 21:08:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb kind of incredible that our subway system from 1908 is running better than D.C.'s from the 60s and 70s, but there you go
709848462955843586 2016-03-15 21:07:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb whereas D.C. it's taken much longer because the system is much newer (and we thought, better maintained??!!!)
709848280948219904 2016-03-15 21:06:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb well i guess MTA hit rock bottom in the early 90s when they had that horrible crash at Union Square.
709847710191493120 2016-03-15 21:04:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb just listening to the officials, they act like they have no real power over the system or a solid idea of how to maintain it?
709846754657701888 2016-03-15 21:00:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb i can't tell if you're joking or not
709844574978621440 2016-03-15 20:51:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TheGattoniCelli working at home tomorrow?
709844300549464071 2016-03-15 20:50:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Normal D.C. traffic is basically apocalypse-level, so good luck, folks
709843785275072512 2016-03-15 20:48:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is the first time the D.C. metro has ever been shut down for non-weather-related conditions
709843346206953472 2016-03-15 20:46:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur i went to kickboxing class last night! super fun
709843117608968194 2016-03-15 20:46:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Panzenbeck yea i grew up in Northern VA and I have a lifelong hatred of the DC metro and its expensive fares!
709842304626982916 2016-03-15 20:42:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Emma_Dumain and way older!
709842098472787968 2016-03-15 20:41:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> Listening to this D.C. metro shutdown conference, and I am struck by how the MTA is actually more competent than WMATA
709839470409945088 2016-03-15 20:31:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @grynbaum i grew up taking the metro in D.C. and i think this every single day!
709817752559685632 2016-03-15 19:05:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly like this is kind of insane. http://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/New-York-NY/pmf,pf_pt/2099458747_zpid/6181_rid/any_days/HDFC-Coop_att/40.682184,-73.932517,40.662101,-73.977449_rect/14_zm/

709814650154696705 2016-03-15 18:52:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly the income caps are typically really outdated, so they only help middle-income people/retirees who have tons of cash lying around
709813540203438081 2016-03-15 18:48:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly actually it's encouraging bc most older HDFC co-ops have such low income caps that no one who fits the income req's could afford them
709811616003575808 2016-03-15 18:40:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @polly I assume that's the cap for a household. is it $142K for one person or a couple?
709765055861100544 2016-03-15 15:35:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday wait so is Hillary guest starring on an actual episode?

709758485303525376 2016-03-15 15:09:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnJCoyne you've got it. also the folks on the sunset park CB are not particularly pro-development
709757061110874112 2016-03-15 15:04:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnJCoyne true. but the M1 zoning and the lower density zoning south of freight tracks actively prevent development
709754172321697792 2016-03-15 14:52:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnJCoyne it seems like a odd place. with the freights and the N right there, seems like a weird (but cheap) place to build.
709752464896036864 2016-03-15 14:45:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnJCoyne he probably said that because it was a "conversion." but sometimes can mean they only preserve the foundation of the old bldg
709748989952970752 2016-03-15 14:32:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JohnJCoyne AFAIK they did not.
709598527526195200 2016-03-14 04:34:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ not necessarily. it depends on the site. bigger issue is parking requirements and fact that grocery stores are low ROI

709501615993200641 2016-03-14 22:09:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade i also don't know what else you expect from Gawker. this is what they were established to do. they throw shade for clicks
709497581341184001 2016-03-14 21:52:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade because there's a general allergy to self-righteousness that Gawker takes to the extreme
709497226356199425 2016-03-14 21:51:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Chris_arnade i am pretty sure most journalists mocking this agree with him, but they resent that he calls himself a journalist.

709477518059954176 2016-03-14 20:33:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SakiWaki i've never liked it, but i watch some garb too so i can't judge too harshly
709473547605975042 2016-03-14 20:17:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SakiWaki ugh
709473497777627137 2016-03-14 20:17:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad exactly! if we extended subways into nabes where land was cheaper, there wouldn't be so much pressure on areas with good subways
709469902965497856 2016-03-14 20:03:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad part of the reason this is happening is that rules about the way a lot of these properties can be developed are too restrictive
709468747266957314 2016-03-14 19:58:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SakiWaki what's this?
709468561719300097 2016-03-14 19:57:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad NYC has never been centrally planned and we can't really go backwards, but there are some easy urban planning steps we could take
709464777299517440 2016-03-14 19:42:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad not entirely sure what you're getting at here
709449710696800256 2016-03-14 18:42:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy @MarketUrbanism there's also the FRESH program but gentrified neighborhoods and most of Manhattan aren't really eligible
709449244994883584 2016-03-14 18:40:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism also expand those zoning and tax incentives for grocery stores!
709444011862446081 2016-03-14 18:20:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> We are going to keep losing grocery stores until the city figures out a better way to incentivize new ones http://ny.curbed.com/maps/map-nyc-grocery-stores-disappearing
709440059150311424 2016-03-14 18:04:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy preservationists like to say so, but i haven't seen much hard evidence to support that. my hood will be  a good case study

709431187761205248 2016-03-14 17:29:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader lol bethesda is ridiculous; this is insanely priced for a house that would probs be freezing in the winter
709414790050013184 2016-03-14 16:24:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism all those people will just end up driving to Tyson's or Leesburg for their major shopping, putting more cars on the road
709414294006452224 2016-03-14 16:22:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i mean that's the goal but when it's such an isolated area, it never really works out that way
709413847183069184 2016-03-14 16:20:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> Isn't Ashburn still the middle of nowhere? What happens if they don't build the Silver Line that far? Oh yeah more traffic on 66 & Beltway

709146901766078466 2016-03-13 22:39:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @danarubinstein maybe city promised to study some version of this voluntary IH thing http://citylimits.org/2016/03/04/absolutely-faab-ulous-in-retort-to-mayor-community-groups-pitch-new-policy/
709135454528999424 2016-03-13 21:54:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @danarubinstein maybe they said that they can't commit to lower income tiers without 421a
709113639178014720 2016-03-13 20:27:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax just saying what's in the story
709087358885490688 2016-03-13 18:42:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ what are you asking
709086427154358273 2016-03-13 18:39:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> Real Affordability for All endorses MIH because the city agreed to do a study on including lower income housing https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160313/civic-center/leading-critics-of-de-blasios-rezoning-plan-endorse-proposal
709085381245997056 2016-03-13 18:35:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MosesNYC @alykatzz @erinmdurkin @TweetBenMax lol clearly not
709084822388527104 2016-03-13 18:32:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ what often happens, rather than having your license suspended, is the CB will pressure you into closing earlier
709084526572654594 2016-03-13 18:31:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @alykatzz @erinmdurkin @TweetBenMax they need to do the study over anyway since new version of 421a will be less generous
709083105076891648 2016-03-13 18:26:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ if the people complaining are your immediate neighbors and they show up to community board meetings
708768420939108353 2016-03-12 21:35:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you've watched House of Cards, you already know the background for that "New York" rally scene was BS http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/house_of_cards_brooklyn.php#photo-1

708711725441409025 2016-03-12 17:50:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter I'm wondering if it's Jersey. The buildings in the background look pretty new
708710194226847744 2016-03-12 17:44:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter are they in sunset park or something? but also the Brooklyn bridge is magically there?
708709918065487873 2016-03-12 17:43:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito there would probably need to be a rezoning to go much larger than that
708707785689735168 2016-03-12 17:34:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism if they don't have it with the 311 data on the open data portal, i don't think it's available
708707426455969793 2016-03-12 17:33:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito yeah :-/ http://www.rockawave.com/news/2014-03-07/Front_Page/Neponsit_Money_Pit.html
708703747388674053 2016-03-12 17:18:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter i'm confused by the location of that rally. is the background photoshopped?
708700098805506048 2016-03-12 17:04:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito the only thing i know about Neponsit is that there's an abandoned TB hospital there

707985346684915713 2016-03-10 17:43:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Uptowncollectiv @Amandarose_718 since the developer will seek a variance, there should be public meetings at the community board and BSA
707984192907382784 2016-03-10 17:39:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @the_zim they also know that Jan and Feb are the slowest times of the year to rent, which is why concessions usually peak then

707712340112842755 2016-03-09 23:39:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko sigh
707711734899986432 2016-03-09 23:36:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko DCP made their presentation, right? Did they emphasize to the board that this is the best way to stem hotel development?
707711176663244804 2016-03-09 23:34:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko also given how hostile CB1's liquor license meetings are, this is not at all surprising
707710890158768133 2016-03-09 23:33:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko so this vote was about the special enhanced district in the North Williamsburg M1 zone?

707698921791950848 2016-03-09 22:45:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz and there is also this whole thing with *permanent* affordable housing. have any other cities done this
707697834196336642 2016-03-09 22:41:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz sorry i feel like i just tweetstormed you abt this but i've spent like a lot of time writing/sitting in hearings about this
707697163032272900 2016-03-09 22:38:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz and city claims it's spending a billion dollars more on housing than the previous admin. really? where would that come from?
707696266285883392 2016-03-09 22:35:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar this is a terrible joke but i laughed anyway
707696147477962753 2016-03-09 22:34:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz and the city council seems hesitant to explain this to their constituents. since then it doesn't seem like they have control
707695997477068800 2016-03-09 22:34:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz and it's not developers, it's the city. we don't get more affordable hsg funding bc folks want it. people don't get that?
707695635298918400 2016-03-09 22:32:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz i feel like we're operating under the problematic assumption that developers can finance affordable hsg in low-income hoods
707695259111825408 2016-03-09 22:31:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz also we're still negotiating MIH. activists/city council want lower income tiers that the city might not be able to finance
707694326588022786 2016-03-09 22:27:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz yeah common pro-development argument. since demand is growing so much faster than supply here it doesn't really matter
707693060323459072 2016-03-09 22:22:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar also i emailed you earlier, just in case you missed it
707692434197778434 2016-03-09 22:19:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz this piece is long, and i've only given it a cursory look. what do you mean?
707691526487408641 2016-03-09 22:16:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HenryGrabar this confused me a bit when i was writing about retail at Fulton Transit Center, bc Westfield manages leasing for BOTH oculuses

707642977590648833 2016-03-09 19:03:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly are you talking about the one who was on the podcast, or was there a different one on Brian Lehrer?
707642343709667328 2016-03-09 19:00:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is actually pretty interesting because they talked to both a flipper who buys at foreclosure auctions and a developer/landlord
707640469069635584 2016-03-09 18:53:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> I suspect I can ID this Hasidic developer they are interviewing on @WNYC podcast on gentrification http://www.wnyc.org/story/mouth-ear-brooklyn-gentrification/?utm_source=wnyc-facebook&utm_medium=facebook
707639248351002624 2016-03-09 18:48:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @timdonnelly i don't think a developer has ever said that to me; most of them certainly know better even if they think that way

707631666555125761 2016-03-09 18:18:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas so they could install these on like 20 buses for less than it costs to renovate one subway station
707630853912961024 2016-03-09 18:15:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas they should do this for the SI routes that go around Farm Colony, because it's surrounded by an inaccessible park/nature preserve
707629261067255808 2016-03-09 18:08:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas what would it take to get bike racks on part of the MTA bus fleet? it can't be that expensive
707628563349028865 2016-03-09 18:06:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> Seriously why can't they at least put bike racks on those buses that go to the Rockaways and Marine Park/Mill Basin? It's needed

707435000862474240 2016-03-08 05:17:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax this MIH thing is a bit of a tempest in a teakettle, since city won't force devs to build low-income if it's not feasible
707430910455586816 2016-03-08 05:00:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax how much lower would the city go? skeptical that affordability levels are going to change much; def no union labor requirement
707429583012937728 2016-03-08 04:55:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax their demands were a bit extreme, so idk. might have gotten more council members on their side, but i don't see HPD budging
707426489806024704 2016-03-08 04:43:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax i wonder what this actually means

707276688703541248 2016-03-08 18:47:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC so is the state able to purchase homes that the owners have abandoned? i wonder how many being auctioned fall into that category
707275612000555009 2016-03-08 18:43:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC yeah that's what's sad about it. Some people can't afford to/won't leave, can't afford to rebuild without Build It Back money
707267615677349888 2016-03-08 18:11:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC ok. i was trying to puzzle it out bc when i wrote this http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/08/designing-a-resilient-home-in-staten-island-after-hurricane-sandy.html, SI pols wanted acquisitions http://www.silive.com/eastshore/index.ssf/2015/08/buy_redevelop_vacant_homes_in.html
707262933626183680 2016-03-08 17:53:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC so state extended buyouts beyond the 3 hoods they originally committed to, which were Oakwood Beach, Ocean Breeze, and Graham Beach?

706957771082756096 2016-03-07 21:40:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 it might be stopped because the developer is trying to flip the site
706957087801282561 2016-03-07 21:37:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 also a possiblity, i forgot that was the same block
706955963312504832 2016-03-07 21:33:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 possibly they will sell the air rights to whoever buys the BBG site around the corner on Montgomery
706954691066904578 2016-03-07 21:28:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 plan examiner returns the plans to architects with corrections, and then they refile. usually takes a few rounds/several months
706954159950598144 2016-03-07 21:26:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 no, that's not what it says. it says the application was assigned to a plan examiner. that's far from approval.
706953886494539776 2016-03-07 21:25:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 i think it's just a way to drive out the remaining tenants, so it probably doesn't matter
706953597800607752 2016-03-07 21:24:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 also they applied for permits on March 3. they are a long way from having permits granted/approved.

706723857772707840 2016-03-06 06:11:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @no_such_zone probably sometime in the next couple weeks. good to go before it gets too hot and stuff gets all gross and overgrown
706714787330301952 2016-03-06 05:35:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @no_such_zone he also doesn't mention the abandoned barracks, which are supposed to be pretty cool (and potentially full of squatters?)
706714501605883904 2016-03-06 05:34:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @seecmb as long as you don't mind dangerous floors, overgrown stuff, trash etc! people don't always know what they're signing up for, lol
706710803366465536 2016-03-06 05:19:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @no_such_zone for an abandoned hospital or military base, it is! but this is particularly extensive bc it's owned by the city
706708410398597120 2016-03-06 05:09:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> Planning a field trip to Fort Totten soon, if anyone wants to wander around an abandoned army base in eastern Queens http://abandonednyc.com/2012/06/23/inside-fort-totten-part-1/
706707140715679744 2016-03-06 05:04:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn no, they're separate, i was just thinking theyre both sizable, square footage wise. Union Square & 59th would be up there too
706706289422962688 2016-03-06 05:01:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn hm @2AvSagas do you know if anyone has figured out the largest subway stations?
706705720755023872 2016-03-06 04:59:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn when you subtract the mall, Fulton isn't that large. just so terribly configured.
706705532636241920 2016-03-06 04:58:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn GC's subway station is not that big. Times Sq is probs the biggest, maybe followed by Atlantic-Pacific, Herald Square, Penn?
706701870866305024 2016-03-06 04:43:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @patrickdehahn i mean it should be for the world's most expensive subway station
706700839474307072 2016-03-06 04:39:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull basically i am way too lazy to use most cosmetics with any regularity
706700602374496256 2016-03-06 04:38:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull i'm simple, so i keep all my skin stuff in the little cupboard under the bathroom sink, and then makeup in a bag  in my room.
706699484881920000 2016-03-06 04:34:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull my roommate has a desk in her room and basically all the drawers are filled with cosmetics. one drawer is just lipsticks.
706695517854679041 2016-03-06 04:18:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_grendan also I've always found it a bit unnerving that there's a PR firm closely linked to BdB that reps both gov't entities & developers
706692920099917824 2016-03-06 04:08:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @_grendan Not surprising? And I think all of these companies employ more than one PR firm
706683542898679808 2016-03-06 03:31:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> And another 745,000 prisoners are in local jails (like Rikers!)
706682733582536705 2016-03-06 03:27:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> As @pbump notes, it'd be tough to keep this promise since majority of prisoners are incarcerated at state levelhttps://twitter.com/pbump/status/706681211524030464
706681115214487552 2016-03-06 03:21:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> No 4 train service in Brooklyn for the next two weekends. Thanks MTA!

706563099722178561 2016-03-06 19:32:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader you'll find him, I'm sure. IIRC it was on the upper floor. like $3200 to $5800 I think
706562653007822848 2016-03-06 19:30:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader there is also one guy selling some Know Hope work there and when he told me how much the pieces were I died a little bit
706562433276628992 2016-03-06 19:29:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader the seizure-inducing red/blue room is cool, as is the fake restaurant and weird performance art mental hospital.
706561540703576064 2016-03-06 19:26:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader go to Spring/Break! It's worth the $15 and more fun than the rest of them
706542796136718337 2016-03-06 18:11:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad whoops about this post http://ltvsquad.com/2016/03/03/abandoned-ozone-park-lirr-station-the-giant-spider-that-lived-there/
706542646311952384 2016-03-06 18:11:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad did you think the spider was a Revs piece? also are these film?
706531652143599617 2016-03-06 17:27:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak i feel like this is true in Manhattan but not always in the outer boros! i am constantly recommending Colina Cuervo in my hood
706531162630574080 2016-03-06 17:25:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @evaholland @ClaraJeffery a lot of people peg it around '80 or '81 now
706528988794118144 2016-03-06 17:16:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ClaraJeffery since cutoff for being a millennial is around 35-36, wouldn't be surprised if that was the majority of campaign reporters now
706523273677443072 2016-03-06 16:54:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader there is also a show that just opened over there west of Penn Station - http://www.paulboothgallery.com/exhibition/pretty-creepy/
706522785317822464 2016-03-06 16:52:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader spring/break is pretty fun because it's installations and weird shit; i didn't bother with the more expensive ones
706520701256204288 2016-03-06 16:43:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader what are all bad? the art fairs?
706332377199583235 2016-03-05 04:15:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller you actually went into that half-demolished wreck?
706331481220771840 2016-03-05 04:12:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur @lainnafader lots of art! but it is nice to have interesting galleries south of Bushwick
706330586080747520 2016-03-05 04:08:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller  i'm still mad about this, that building dated back to the 1830s! they could have at LEAST made it into condos or something
706329313755455490 2016-03-05 04:03:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller i thought that's what you meant. it looked like Ossining but I wasn't sure. clearly the town halted the demo; how fucked up
706327713360027648 2016-03-05 03:57:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller which building?
706321405508456448 2016-03-05 03:32:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader it's in cobble hill! i def have to go

706064774736551937 2016-03-05 10:32:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lrsphm it was a pretty cold bike ride home
705958681616195584 2016-03-04 03:30:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @DanielKayHertz @MarketUrbanism @ISANobody_ what about like Sunset Park or Bay Ridge? Or Jackson Heights?
705956289185185792 2016-03-04 03:21:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj having bars on your windows is super annoying tho if you ever want to put an A/C in
705955966064447488 2016-03-04 03:19:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj just checked, my window locks do in fact work. how much longer will you stay if he doesn't replace the windows?
705955281604374528 2016-03-04 03:17:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj i like being a long(ish)-term tenant. it gives me some leverage with the LL because he knows he's put me through some shit
705954426964590592 2016-03-04 03:13:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj ugh this is making me nervous
705954364121346049 2016-03-04 03:13:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj Bushwick does have a robbery problem
705954022029713409 2016-03-04 03:12:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj but I wil def check anyway, you never know
705953965859536896 2016-03-04 03:11:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj oh i remembered I live at the back of the bldg so it would be pretty tough to get to our fire escape unless you were in backyard
705952838430662657 2016-03-04 03:07:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj oh shit I live on the second floor too
705952694113067008 2016-03-04 03:06:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj so it's a ground floor apt? Or did someone climb up a fire escape to get to your place?
705952375396290560 2016-03-04 03:05:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @smithsj @The_Suburbanist I know more than one person whose apartment had a serious fire in last year! Made me really consider
705949434719424512 2016-03-04 02:53:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @tzvifiller this is a pretty shot, Tzvi
705949141961216000 2016-03-04 02:52:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chrismcnally if Meals on Wheels could afford to buy land, I'm sure they would. Instead they're taking this from the city for cheap or free
705879984137748485 2016-03-04 22:17:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Meals on Wheels is building a new facility there, with a design approved by Landmarks http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/03/meals-on-wheels-files-plans-for-buildings-at-abandoned-seaview-hospital-on-staten-island.htmlpic.twitter.com/gwUXLjt8iY
705879305537134593 2016-03-04 22:15:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> Part of Seaview's abandoned hospital campus is being developed, but as far as we know, no buildings are being demo'd http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/03/meals-on-wheels-files-plans-for-buildings-at-abandoned-seaview-hospital-on-staten-island.html

705843041907707904 2016-03-04 19:51:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak i guess for a lot of people it does. and you're including travelling under the umbrella of "consumption"?
705838531059568640 2016-03-04 19:33:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak so much effort and money
705837809836265472 2016-03-04 19:30:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak so i'm reading your newsletter and it seems like you're describing kind of a... performative approach to a lifestyle? or curated
705834168228438016 2016-03-04 19:15:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad that's too bad but I'm not too surprised
705831444128600065 2016-03-04 19:05:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad ha i was actually thinking of going here today, but life and work got in the way
705826778523312129 2016-03-04 18:46:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nahmias they should have just shredded it and sent you the pieces
705826667391029248 2016-03-04 18:46:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @nahmias oh how helpful
705793389673971714 2016-03-04 16:33:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @capntransit if the criticism is about this area's transit, i have trouble seeing why more resi development is the answer
705789185563742208 2016-03-04 16:17:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @capntransit plus the plan is to build senior housing at the Farm Colony across the street, so good to have services here
705788974779011072 2016-03-04 16:16:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @capntransit yes but like what else would you put here? part of the campus is already an active hospital, it's landmarked...
705787672946712576 2016-03-04 16:11:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @capntransit also they are moving from Port Richmond, which is served by buses just like this area is
705785786097074177 2016-03-04 16:03:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @fitnr @capntransit the property is abandoned, landmarked and owned by the city. what else should be done with it?

705597771139686400 2016-03-03 03:36:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @politicsngravy are you pinning like 80 years of racist housing policy on one president
705595880934662145 2016-03-03 03:29:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> Sixty years of left-wing policies..... What about that redlining? uhhh ok Cruz

705591524340404224 2016-03-03 03:11:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> Megyn Kelly just quoted court docs that compared Donald Trump's victims to people scammed by Bernie Madoff

705582888486625284 2016-03-03 02:37:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> My god Donald is talking about how Joe Arpaio endorsed him

705581729747226625 2016-03-03 02:32:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> Kasich was very strong on that budget answer
705580080966311938 2016-03-03 02:26:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> Chris Wallace asks who would collect taxes without the IRS... and Cruz talks about postcards??!

705560521702043648 2016-03-03 01:08:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarioMangiameli not sure exactly what you mean. i'm in a long-term relationship and my bf is in grad school, so i often pay
705560331872047104 2016-03-03 01:07:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> tfw you realize your roommate didn't pay the electric bill for seven months and they somehow haven't turned the lights off
705533157555224577 2016-03-03 23:19:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @akgerber i do it but don't necessarily identify it as feminist. it seems polite, and as one girl says, you feel less beholden when you pay
705531072604413953 2016-03-03 23:11:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn shhh Rosa don't let actual reporting get in the way of everyone's narrative
705529733333852161 2016-03-03 23:06:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> "If a woman insisted on paying, I would think she was socially awkward" :-/

705515185486864385 2016-03-03 22:08:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader this woman who says she'll offer to pay six months into the relationship has clearly never dated anyone who makes less than her
705514705511653376 2016-03-03 22:06:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader yeah this is weird. also who has time to go on dates "at least twice a week"?

705512540940410880 2016-03-03 21:57:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday i think it's funny when i go to CB meetings and the chair says "just so you all know, we are being blogged"
705512338242273280 2016-03-03 21:57:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday kind of wish every local internet journalist just had a business card that said "the blogs"

705458203727941632 2016-03-03 18:21:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kath_krueger also weird to think we will no longer be reading him and John Herrman. The Awl might be totally different in six months
705457624335171584 2016-03-03 18:19:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kath_krueger i think coffee shops are a very particular thing, i have reacted virulently to previous Awl posts about my fave coffee spots
705457085262262273 2016-03-03 18:17:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kath_krueger this is extremely east village/NYU/LES-focused. some hidden gems in the West Village and Chelsea, like Grounded on Jane St
705456109201584128 2016-03-03 18:13:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kath_krueger it's not a bad place to sit if you need to kill some time in that area. tbh this list is kind of snobby tho
705436391900057600 2016-03-03 16:55:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> Anyone else think all these parks promised for Gowanus are just a myth developers created to get city approvals? https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160302/gowanus/gowanus-developer-banking-on-long-planned-park-as-amenity-for-new-offices

705424262870515712 2016-03-03 16:07:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> many thanks to @efrost1 and @ReporterLeslie, whose old reporting on UWS I relied on/linked to for this post

705074745432104960 2016-03-02 16:58:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka cleaning under furniture is gross because you never think to move it when you're cleaning normally (or at least i don't)
705073038971301889 2016-03-02 16:51:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka this happened to me like 20 times when i switched rooms last month
705072633927303169 2016-03-02 16:49:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> If tenants can't trust NYCHA to handle Prospect Plazawhich was originally supposed to be a rehabwhy should they put faith in land leases?
705072042379517952 2016-03-02 16:47:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> The project is nice, but the fact that NYCHA emptied out these towers and hasn't built enough housing for former residents is problematic
705071301153693697 2016-03-02 16:44:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> The Prospect Plaza affordable housing development, which replaced four NYCHA towers, is coming along in Ocean Hill http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/03/first-phase-of-prospect-plaza-affordable-housing-inches-toward-the-finish-line-in-ocean-hill.html

704866307070664704 2016-03-01 03:09:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarioMangiameli if the cops were able to enforce all these crimes equally, then we wouldn't have to do this
704866177223417856 2016-03-01 03:09:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarioMangiameli whole reason they're doing this is that the NYPD disproportionately targets people of color when it comes to these arrests
704864946752987136 2016-03-01 03:04:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> Who actually says "Kadr"
704863989851942912 2016-03-01 03:00:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarioMangiameli i have personally seen cops only arrest black folks drinking publicly in a crowd of white people drinking publicly.
704863752303349760 2016-03-01 02:59:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarioMangiameli if you're drunk and disorderly that's a different story. we're only talking about open container enforcement.
704862281016934402 2016-03-01 02:53:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarioMangiameli arresting people for drinking in public is another easy way to target minorities and toss them in jail for other things.
704860692193660928 2016-03-01 02:47:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> Imagine four years of Chris Christie making this face at Donald Trump

703331395041665028 2016-02-26 21:30:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL there now! They also have very reasonably priced candles downstairs at World Market (in Chelsea)
703311529131810816 2016-02-26 20:11:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold @MarketUrbanism @owenstone yeah the way properties are assessed is a big issue (and i suspect the city benefits from the flaws)
703309386400325634 2016-02-26 20:03:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 @leemfrank if only i needed 5 gal i wouldn't need a real trashcan!
703306702867861508 2016-02-26 19:52:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold @MarketUrbanism but the assessment system is a state issue, right? just like the property tax cap?
703306388924145664 2016-02-26 19:51:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @leemfrank yeah for real, $40 is my absolute limit. i refuse to pay $50 for a trash can
703305662021898242 2016-02-26 19:48:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Five_Three actually planning on going to triple B today to investigate the matter
703305555817975808 2016-02-26 19:48:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @leemfrank well and places like Target never have them in stock! Seems weird to shop for on Amazon, but I guess it's fine if free delivery
703305353354731520 2016-02-26 19:47:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Five_Three there are actually more BB&B's than i thought, but the biggest one that's accessible to me is in Chelsea

703285443677257728 2016-02-26 18:28:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sydbrownstone ...which is a weird reason to shoot down a project rather than just make the developer change it! (or include affordable hsg)
703285259677392897 2016-02-26 18:27:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @sydbrownstone yea it's not like they could build parking underneath the new building! also, sounds like it was overturned bc of the design

703242837761105920 2016-02-26 15:38:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KELLYWEILL Ikea has super cheap candles in their marketplace if you are willing to make the trip! I've gotten them on sale at Target also.

703080417667186688 2016-02-25 04:53:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mlbplanning @MarketUrbanism @keller_jd the zoning doesn't allow it. even if it did, the owners would have to remediate the property first
703054850737774594 2016-02-25 03:11:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime bikes!
703053606832963584 2016-02-25 03:06:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @keller_jd @mlbplanning but if you have examples, please point me to them!
703053546544107520 2016-02-25 03:06:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @keller_jd @mlbplanning i have never seen new resi construction next to a heavy industrial use like that, esp if it required a rezoning
703052076360843265 2016-02-25 03:00:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @keller_jd @mlbplanning also ZoLA doesn't show a specific waterfront access plan here
703051797053710336 2016-02-25 02:59:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @keller_jd @mlbplanning i'd be surprised if those houses were built after '61 zoning code. they're usually in heavy manufacturing zones
703048718057136128 2016-02-25 02:47:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @keller_jd @mlbplanning both. There are zoning restrictions and environmental ones
703046865294639104 2016-02-25 02:40:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @keller_jd @mlbplanning see my first tweet to him. it's a manufacturing zone
703045515273965568 2016-02-25 02:34:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mlbplanning there's also the matter of (1) substantial environmental cleanup &(2) you're not allowed to build resi next to a concrete plant
703043392553525248 2016-02-25 02:26:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mlbplanning @KarrieUrbanist it's a manufacturing zone, and the city doesn't grant variances to build resi next to the Gowanus

702913915068538880 2016-02-25 17:51:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KensingerNathan no i meant the Bush Terminal one. I like that all the machinery is still in there and you can climb to all the diff levels
702911375576834048 2016-02-25 17:41:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel all this property is owned by the spice factory people
702910162814812160 2016-02-25 17:36:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel i've always wanted to go inside this building; i actually think it would be totally salvageable
702909510835314688 2016-02-25 17:34:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel that's what i thought you were talking about! wasn't that part of the Crest Linen site?

702895304723582976 2016-02-25 16:37:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel of course but they occupy a huge building in prime north W'burg so if their LL wants $500/sf or something, I'm sure it's too much

702349473205379073 2016-02-23 04:28:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SaraMorrison like hasn't paying people off been part of celebrity gossip reporting for ages?
702348135293702145 2016-02-23 04:23:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SaraMorrison yea but National Enquirer's been paying people off for like 50 years. maybe TMZ just had more money and better connects?
702347606802825216 2016-02-23 04:21:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> Fascinating that the TMZ founder changed celebrity gossip biz with beat reporting, pulling court records http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/inside-harvey-levins-tmz
702336166125821952 2016-02-23 03:36:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism yes well they have at least six months till they have to worry about it

702332920124542976 2016-02-23 03:23:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax also, no data on CB application numbers in the other boros? I only see stats for Manhattan here
702332571611480064 2016-02-23 03:21:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax ha well some CBs treat liquor licenses like a life or death thing, so it's hard to know!
702330815473176576 2016-02-23 03:14:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV oh yes. it's been in several real estate trend pieces, including NYT (prob WSJ too). developers and brokers love saying this.
702329908354289664 2016-02-23 03:11:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV "have you heard about how the South Bronx is going to be the next Dumbo?"
702329275362451456 2016-02-23 03:08:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV no joke this happens to me several times a week

702264787380506625 2016-02-23 22:52:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emilyhughes also this piece reads like it was not edited much?
702264428851568640 2016-02-23 22:51:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @emilyhughes tho being an obstinate piece of shit is sort of part of your job as a congressman (at least these days! It didn't used to be)
702253592871219200 2016-02-23 22:07:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull @coreybeasley I'm from VA; they're all over the South I believe
702252607897731072 2016-02-23 22:04:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @amandamull @coreybeasley oh no are you going to start talking about Church's Chicken or Jack in the Box next
702250733572374528 2016-02-23 21:56:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @AubernaLevy like a way better version of those things that measure how fast you're going and display the speed
702231934089433089 2016-02-23 20:41:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa weird and unacceptable

702174249956548612 2016-02-23 16:52:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @joeperainojr i mean the fee doesn't seem that out of line, but it does seem like they designed an unnecessarily expensive building
702173608752377856 2016-02-23 16:50:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @joeperainojr well @NYDNGregSmith says cost of the project is $51 million, so evidently they're expecting to spend $46 mm on construction
702172528354185217 2016-02-23 16:45:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> And 40th precinct is the city's poorest and most violent http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/nyregion/in-a-bronx-police-precinct-homicides-persist-as-crime-drops-elsewhere.html?_r=0&mtrref=query.nytimes.com&gwh=C32351D36F4EE9A2F75613CB0C264E0C&gwt=pay
702172053571563520 2016-02-23 16:43:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa yeah they say that like six times in the Daily News piece
702171429803008000 2016-02-23 16:41:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> And Bjarke charged the city $3.8 million for that design. Wow

702155680715821056 2016-02-23 15:38:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @ISANobody_ god they built so much ugly stuff on Bowery
702154482667413504 2016-02-23 15:34:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @ISANobody_ its a condo. it's called the Nolita Place Condo http://streeteasy.com/building/nolita-place-condominiums
702152783525445632 2016-02-23 15:27:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday it's gotten a lot better recently
702144700560646144 2016-02-23 14:55:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @MarketUrbanism if the lot were redeveloped, it could get a plaza bonus if the developer offered enough public space
702144319629746177 2016-02-23 14:53:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @MarketUrbanism it's the world's ugliest condo building, apparently
702143351429144576 2016-02-23 14:49:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @MarketUrbanism plaza bonuses for what?

701990229721411584 2016-02-22 04:41:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @brianstelter @felixsalmon i suspect it's just editors who are stuck in their ways, have been doing it the same way for a decade or more
701977506509889536 2016-02-22 03:50:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb that's awesome! congrats and good luck!
701940924289568768 2016-02-22 01:25:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb what's the job?
701939668577812480 2016-02-22 01:20:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb i am from the DC area, so i remember when most of these neighborhoods still looked like you'd dropped a bomb on them!
701938947623096322 2016-02-22 01:17:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb Petworth isn't bad. H Street corridor and "NoMA" is still somewhat affordable
701938047978442752 2016-02-22 01:14:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb also depends where you work! rent in the District isn't cheap these days, def cheaper in car-dependent 'burbs
701937319620825088 2016-02-22 01:11:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @devin_mb i have a friend who just moved to Columbia Heights. U Street corridor is gentrifying, starting to get a bit pricey, but seems nice
701919128890826753 2016-02-22 23:58:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> This is depressing, even by the standards of pieces about the death of reporting/journalism http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2016/2/journalism-crisis-leads-to-shameful-compromises.html
701906535035883521 2016-02-22 23:08:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @biocuriosity @rachelholliday hope that's on their Yelp page
701889023388815360 2016-02-22 21:59:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday *menaces
701888971316584448 2016-02-22 21:59:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday you found like one adorable raccoon out of the 100,000 who are complete meances
701857006341251072 2016-02-22 19:52:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas as you would hope from old-school media outlets with large metro staffs. i'm not sure what you expect from everyone else
701856267296321537 2016-02-22 19:49:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @sandypsj I think that's bc RE is one of their long-standing sections. brings in ad revenue, print subscribers read it.
701855020296359936 2016-02-22 19:44:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i don't think all of it is fawning! I think we've gotten a fair amount of critical coverage since that first NYT piece
701854746341220352 2016-02-22 19:43:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @sandypsj also real estate and transportation are both typically considered "niche" or "trade" reporting
701854152134160385 2016-02-22 19:40:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @sandypsj experienced journos typically can do analysis, but how often will your legacy media employer let you do it? rarely
701853588772020226 2016-02-22 19:38:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @sandypsj also fact that reporters at newspapers often don't have column space/freedom to explain these policy issues
701853279815335936 2016-02-22 19:37:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @sandypsj they often suffer from the same issue. reporters who don't want to be negative bc they're afraid to lose sources
701851079416356866 2016-02-22 19:28:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas oh! well sometimes they lock the hatches in the tunnels, which seems rather dangerous for workers
701850549730353152 2016-02-22 19:26:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas are we only talking about emergency exits from the stations or the hatches in the tunnels?
701848833916071936 2016-02-22 19:19:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @steadyblogging @MarketUrbanism seems like it's still on the market. $60 million is a lot!
701848076856721408 2016-02-22 19:16:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas i was just talking about stories about the Friday roundtable. who called it sleek/futuristic in the Times? Was it Ginia?
701847684127260672 2016-02-22 19:15:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas also WNYC http://www.wnyc.org/story/8-qs-and-s-about-bqx-streetcar/
701847356271108097 2016-02-22 19:13:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas so far i have seen stories from Dan http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-queens-streetcar-spur-bike-walk-paths-article-1.2538214 and the BK Paper reporter http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/9/dtg-streetcar-bridges-2016-02-26-bk.html
701847085897932801 2016-02-22 19:12:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas nope, i didn't call it "futuristic" or "sleek." but there were like 10ish reporters at Friday roundtable http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/02/new-bridges-and-financial-details-for-brooklyn-queens-streetcar.html
701846482090065920 2016-02-22 19:10:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas pretty sure i did this
701846241811021826 2016-02-22 19:09:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism so odd that there isn't a retail overlay here
701839901654917121 2016-02-22 18:44:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> One reporter at this streetcar meeting nailed it: "Is it because rich folks like this kind of transit better?" http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/02/new-bridges-and-financial-details-for-brooklyn-queens-streetcar.html
701637532388302848 2016-02-21 05:19:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> A friend just got me this book of poems made from blacking out parts of newspaper articles, and it's pretty cleverpic.twitter.com/obmufhtOWc
701634091255468032 2016-02-21 05:06:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @nicolegelinas also she made a totally valid point about parking requirements! while illustrating she doesn't understand ZQA

701591344008011776 2016-02-21 02:16:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader it was a pretty decent street art show. Whisbe, JA (!!!), Giz, Ghost, Dain, Gumshoe, Audrey Kawasaki... all sorts of folks.
701588480804184065 2016-02-21 02:05:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Rochdalian MTA guys: "you can't take photos of the yard. it's bc of terrorism. you don't look like a terrorist, but you know what we mean"
701588303183798274 2016-02-21 02:04:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Rochdalian I once got yelled at while taking photos of the Sunset Park yard (from a public spot).
701587705076064256 2016-02-21 02:01:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader i stumbled across a show at Castle Fitzjohns Gallery at Orchard and Delancey today. have you seen it?
701569609938432000 2016-02-21 00:50:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Rochdalian has anyone ever given you a hard time about taking photos of the MTA yards?
701569444162703360 2016-02-21 00:49:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime I didn't support him but I'll kind of miss Jeb in the race
701563285989105665 2016-02-21 00:24:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair In terms of places like Atlantic, there's def more coverage of fair housing and its ties to race (Ta Nehisi Coates, etc)
701562849227882497 2016-02-21 00:23:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair oh! Not really. It's always been a very policy-oriented thing, so I dont think people outside of NYC, SF, DC, care much
701561889915068417 2016-02-21 00:19:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair yeah definitely at the level of local news, much more coverage because a number of new housing policies & how CBs hate them
701561065176485888 2016-02-21 00:16:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair mayor talking about it all the time, rezonings, media coverage has raised some awareness among public over the last year
701557050866855936 2016-02-21 00:00:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair about what exactly? Affordable housing?
701554951160516608 2016-02-21 23:51:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @im_sinclair the fact that this coincides with the events in "Show Me a Hero" is not at all surprising

700815199150866432 2016-02-19 22:52:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas sure. & it's confusing that there are bellmouths/sections of tunnel built in '70s that have never been used for passenger service
700814690281074688 2016-02-19 22:50:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas what are people confused about?
700814185161105412 2016-02-19 22:48:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas yay the return of the express N train in Manhattan!
700812585990496256 2016-02-19 22:41:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy but Glen is not about this at all
700812479111282688 2016-02-19 22:41:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy i agree. or the developers building major projects along the route should be expected to contribute directly
700785636278726657 2016-02-19 20:54:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy @MarketUrbanism i kind of hate 770 Broadway but all the AOL-affiliated companies and HuffPo are there
700714067586113537 2016-02-19 16:10:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism also 421-a is only for new construction. conversions and renos can get J-51
700713300456304641 2016-02-19 16:07:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism honestly the prices on this Bedford conversion are not bad
700712895634612224 2016-02-19 16:05:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism they already have the abatement so it's not going anywhere. the issue is for projects that don't have it yet
700711949651329028 2016-02-19 16:02:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik @MarketUrbanism not much going to happen on that front without 421-a
700701171363745793 2016-02-19 15:19:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @teamsweeting my landlord hasn't sent me a new lease yet so who knows!

700698214257844226 2016-02-19 15:07:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @teamsweeting how?
700698137241976832 2016-02-19 15:07:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday those saki monkeys are incredibly weird looking
700567029452034048 2016-02-18 06:26:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism ok true. but what about this tax lien thing? it often takes a really long time to foreclose on a defaulting property
700566176729014272 2016-02-18 06:22:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism there's also all this stuff about liens/speeding up the foreclosure process that i'm not sure i understand

700564393835233280 2016-02-18 06:15:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism the idea appears to be that the city would be eligible for extra affordable housing funding from the state with a land bank
700559909998477312 2016-02-18 05:57:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism also, the point about  agencies that aren't HPD controlling vacant/barely utilized lots is a good one.
700559376424292352 2016-02-18 05:55:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism how much does a land bank cost the city? it's a pretty common thing, isn't it?

700446070166437889 2016-02-18 22:25:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ajs seems like high potential for theft
700445545253498880 2016-02-18 22:23:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts yes, we all have our crosses to bear
700439580923817984 2016-02-18 21:59:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts also you can't raise taxes on single-fam homeowners!
700439516188909569 2016-02-18 21:59:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts the state legislature is not going to do that bc we generate too much revenue for them
700439016433459200 2016-02-18 21:57:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts exactly. so unless they want development in the outer boroughs to collapse, they will come up with a substitute
700438753752563713 2016-02-18 21:56:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts the administration is going to come up with a substitute for 421-a, because other option is overhauling the property tax system
700438292324605952 2016-02-18 21:54:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts if this project collapses there's fewer property taxes for the street car! lol
700437878741061634 2016-02-18 21:52:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jamesfacts but what about the *affordable housing*

699672433440251904 2016-02-16 19:11:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @stphnbckr i mean we can't even turn the extra, weirdly narrow traffic lane on the QB into a bike/pedestrian lane
699671591781793792 2016-02-16 19:08:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @stphnbckr no one is willing to sacrifice traffic lanes for bikes on the bridges so here we are

699670080557293568 2016-02-16 19:02:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @stphnbckr yeah it wasn't built with bikes in mind so unless we ban tourists from walking across it during rush hour, no hope
699669309908520961 2016-02-16 18:58:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @stphnbckr we need better bike lanes in downtown BK regardless! bike lanes to the Willy B are fine. Ones to BK Bridge are awful

699646151650385920 2016-02-16 17:26:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader I was also doing research for my and Chris's anniversary dinner. So many options! Hard to choose
699646051888795650 2016-02-16 17:26:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader yay!
699645926378381312 2016-02-16 17:26:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader I was just reading about this in the Times and thinking the same thing

699623117661020160 2016-02-16 15:55:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra @witoldr I will check it out! I know he had been a journalist, I will try to find some of his writing
699622037787115524 2016-02-16 15:51:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra i mean he was considered a landscape architect later on, right?
699618176397676549 2016-02-16 15:35:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @LangeAlexandra the architect? what did you assign from him?
699613397923581953 2016-02-16 15:16:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 yeah I'm not really sold on that part of the argument, bc the tax estimates seem like a stretch
699612218606878720 2016-02-16 15:12:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whynot_31 I know. But my point is that we don't really have that shared sense of responsibility in New York, and only so many transit cops
699611399681605632 2016-02-16 15:08:50 UTC <thecitywanderer> It's also easy to fare jump on trams/streetcars in some larger European cities. Thinking of Vienna, Berlin, Prague...

698949119734374401 2016-02-14 19:17:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism also L+M! I always think of them as the other big one
698948274225618947 2016-02-14 19:13:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism you think so? Hudson builds lots of subsidized/low-income housing; I fail to see how this is any different
698947245371211776 2016-02-14 19:09:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism it's basically a foregone conclusion that Hudson and maybe a few other developers would build these
698946107922116608 2016-02-14 19:05:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism i imagine a lot of it! but couldn't that 50% affordable still be relatively high income? 120% AMI or whatever?
698945060143022081 2016-02-14 19:01:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism i think to fill a significant portion of $$ hole we would need federal funds on the scale it took to build NYCHA
698944549452935168 2016-02-14 18:59:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism i think the plan to redevelop the open space in NYCHA projects, while wildly unpopular, is the only real option
698942767611908097 2016-02-14 18:51:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism yes, since that ended up being the mistake with Prospect Plaza... they moved people out with no guarantees
698942625957748737 2016-02-14 18:51:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @SoBendito sure, but  the city kicked several hundred out of Prospect Plaza (a HOPE VI deal) and they got nothing out of it
698942106409299968 2016-02-14 18:49:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @MarketUrbanism there have been instances of raze & redevelop, but they were v poorly handled so there's no trust from tenants
698938915508592642 2016-02-14 18:36:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism the development still got built, so who cares what he named streets? i doubt it will stop people from buying those houses
698317699869470720 2016-02-12 01:28:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader i have to go down to Church Ave and I am not excited
698308731067621377 2016-02-12 00:52:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism like new construction in the West Village could be anything but condos after a 9,000-square-foot site sells for $26m
698304592292012032 2016-02-12 00:36:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas well after that one wall was leaking on the day it opened, we knew it was all going to be down hill from there
698303732598054912 2016-02-12 00:32:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @2AvSagas this is pretty depressing
698277781046738944 2016-02-12 22:49:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader :(
698276554502184960 2016-02-12 22:44:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SaraMorrison @netflix i'm imagining them reviving Diagnosis Murder and Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman and laughing hysterically
698252375732195328 2016-02-12 21:08:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ I couldn't possibly comment 
698250952340541441 2016-02-12 21:02:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ I should ask my friends who go into the sewers; I'm sure there's wood down there too!
698250441189146626 2016-02-12 21:00:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ also since you live in LES your sewers were built sometime in the late 1700s/early 1800s, often with brick
698248818136109056 2016-02-12 20:54:25 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ the Gowanus Canal is basically a giant CSO. And there are CSOs all along Newtown Creek and East River.
698248587780689922 2016-02-12 20:53:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ a lot of that stuff  I'm talking about ends up in CSOs.
698248415050907650 2016-02-12 20:52:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ what they don't tell you is that sometimes that toxic ground water can filter into our drinking water. Fun!
698248017992773632 2016-02-12 20:51:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TSDrown interesting. I wonder what their job protections are like. Do they have a union maybe? Or possibly it's federally regulated?
698247428319899649 2016-02-12 20:48:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, doesn't it worry anyone else that boats carrying toxic substances just sink in NYC waterways all the time and we barely hear about it?
698245522558230531 2016-02-12 20:41:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TSDrown I'm not sure if these dudes actually weld, I think they just investigate the situation
698242316662927360 2016-02-12 20:28:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SaraMorrison I've never understood how people can live off the 1 train
698241217285517313 2016-02-12 20:24:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @teamsweeting it really depends on the buyers and what the C of O says. Sometimes it's an SRO, which is a whole different ballgame
698240960682131460 2016-02-12 20:23:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @teamsweeting i know someone who bought one of those big old houses in the HD and turned it into a single family so I know it happens!
698239551492517889 2016-02-12 20:17:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @teamsweeting I used to write these. the editor, Cate, knows old houses better than most. But yes, probably true unless they drop the price.
698235119291797506 2016-02-12 19:59:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @eparillon I hope Preet gets involved
698234385670258688 2016-02-12 19:57:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @eparillon not an SRO, not a hotel, not a traditional rental... Either the law changes or the city takes Airbnb to court
698231907734126592 2016-02-12 19:47:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @teamsweeting price is pretty high considering it's kind of a wreck

698214077345218560 2016-02-12 18:36:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GwynneFitz yup, thanks. It just seems strange they can't work on the abandoned building bc one of the others is used for laundry?
698197218461884417 2016-02-12 17:29:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad I think DHS holds onto their property for dear life. I mean that huge armory in Crown Heights could clearly be better used too
698196882011648001 2016-02-12 17:28:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ converting industrial bldgs to office space is starting to pick up but unless you're Kickstarter, you don't do that on your own
698196588594855936 2016-02-12 17:26:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ welllll that's why they are trying to make them more efficiently zoned (sort of).
698195912972177409 2016-02-12 17:24:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ no, but it needs more space to put them in where rents aren't incredibly high
698195706058838016 2016-02-12 17:23:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad I guess they mean another building in the complex is being used for laundry? baffling

697903522499665921 2016-02-11 22:02:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @transbay @newyorkyimby yes that's probably true

697856611403096065 2016-02-11 18:55:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad @tzvifiller apparently the MTA sometimes leaves the hatches open. hopefully opportunity strikes again soon

697796374960672768 2016-02-11 14:56:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BrooklynSpoke @Naparstek that would be feasible under the current plan since even a 26K grocery store would only be half the retail

697794926856269824 2016-02-11 14:50:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Naparstek @MarketUrbanism @2AvSagas sure. I think this will be a much tougher negotiation bc this is a much bigger/more complex project
697794218828365824 2016-02-11 14:48:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @Naparstek @2AvSagas also Lander doesn't have that a ton of leverage here bc he isn't directly part of approval process...

697793012550778880 2016-02-11 14:43:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Naparstek @2AvSagas @MarketUrbanism less parking means less upfront cost for devs. but bigger grocery store also means less long-term $$
697792440091197440 2016-02-11 14:40:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Naparstek @2AvSagas @MarketUrbanism problem is, i don't think getting rid of substantial parking will mean a bigger grocery store
697792180916785154 2016-02-11 14:39:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @GeorgetownMet @kristoncapps i would be interested in that story! has it been written about somewhere? article or book of DC history?

697630010283290624 2016-02-10 03:55:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @riccoja @MarketUrbanism @ISANobody_ this is a shockingly classy Fedders. it also has arched windows, a porch, nice fence
697628508386914305 2016-02-10 03:49:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @MarketUrbanism @riccoja what is that
697627814938480640 2016-02-10 03:46:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TweetBenMax didn't someone (Greenfield?) mention in passing during hearing today that they were having issues w/Flushing West?
697627459865419776 2016-02-10 03:45:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @riccoja @ISANobody_ literally everything is stunning next to a Fedders building
697627198640037889 2016-02-10 03:44:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @riccoja @ISANobody_ are you talking about that house with the columns? its kind of bizarre
697625930152468481 2016-02-10 03:39:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @riccoja @ISANobody_ New York is just a much larger city with way more construction of all kinds. D.C.'s never been that attractive honestly
697625347844603904 2016-02-10 03:36:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @riccoja @ISANobody_ easy to say the same for NYC. if you include the D.C. suburbs, quality of the architecture drops dramatically
697624496463814657 2016-02-10 03:33:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @riccoja also a lot of new construction in D.C. is terrible. but i'm glad to see it happening since i grew up there
697624208768106496 2016-02-10 03:32:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @riccoja honestly new construction architecture varies so widely here. sometimes its wonderful, sometimes it's awful

697537511107784704 2016-02-10 21:47:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ i guess! but the housing production and regulatory terms are pretty separate issues

697469703674060800 2016-02-10 17:18:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> Fwiw, basically many developers building  in this part of Queens want to build smaller

697451126371852288 2016-02-10 16:04:41 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko there are also high income areas in NYC with crappy transit, so it's kind of a silly debate
697450635831205889 2016-02-10 16:02:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko there are relatively working class areas in outer boroughs that have good transit - South Bronx, Jamaica, parts of Flatbush
697450263918080000 2016-02-10 16:01:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> @mikecherepko that is not entirely true
697450138739023873 2016-02-10 16:00:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin @shaneferro yeah it kind of does negate it but the admin is trying to transition into it slowly with building code changes
697449141123883008 2016-02-10 15:56:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat Greenfield is asking good questions at least
697449066347827200 2016-02-10 15:56:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> Been says people who live in affordable housing own fewer cars, but AFAIK those studies were mostly about low income areas
697447850507108352 2016-02-10 15:51:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> Greenfield clarifies by asking "We're talking about what the previous administration called micro-units...pretty much across the board?"
697446714140205057 2016-02-10 15:47:09 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat the fact that we can't have water bottles is pretty unjust too tbh
697446586465546240 2016-02-10 15:46:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito he's concerned, and that folks wouldn't be happy living in tiny apts. "my grandma couldn't fit her hats in an apt that small"
697446044414554112 2016-02-10 15:44:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> Richards doesn't like smaller units - part of ZQA is dropping minimum unit size from 475 to 200 sf http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20151023/REAL_ESTATE/151029914/good-news-for-singles-who-dont-want-roommates-more-tiny-apartments-are-on-the-way
697444947872653312 2016-02-10 15:40:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> He wants more oversight for senior housing developers who want to axe parking, rather than allowing them to do it as of right
697444551515119616 2016-02-10 15:38:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@DRichards13 seems pretty concerned about what process developers will have to through to eliminate parking for senior housing
697442839232434178 2016-02-10 15:31:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> They claim 30-year regulatory terms will be enough to maintain affordability, altho we're seeing 70s bldgs pass out of these periods now
697442568674635777 2016-02-10 15:30:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> Been struggled with the fact that affordable housingwhether for seniors or notisn't permanent w/o cross-subsidy with higher priced apts
697441438787899392 2016-02-10 15:26:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> @danielleiat none of it's permanently affordable without cross subsidy, both senior and non-senior, is what I think she's saying
697439465506209792 2016-02-10 15:18:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> LiveOn thinks ZQA would allow 2,000 new senior affordable units to be built on existing sites
697435491084476416 2016-02-10 15:02:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> Both Been and Weisbrod have reiterated that parking spots cost $50,000 each to build
697434259116724224 2016-02-10 14:57:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> ZQA hearing is a bit less packed, and much more sparsely attended by City Council members so far than yesterday's MIH hearing.

697247037557968896 2016-02-09 02:33:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ryanchutchins they just keep trying to top themselves; it makes me a little nervous about what the next super crazy cover will be
697246459062853632 2016-02-09 02:31:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ old white people in Park Slope are just like old white people everywhere else
697245855888379904 2016-02-09 02:29:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ yes that's why people are pissed
697236302903820288 2016-02-09 01:51:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> I think tonight was the first time I heard a room full of 100+ people hiss at a developer (though surely not the last!)
697215229382565888 2016-02-09 00:27:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> Key Food developer says he can go as large as 7,500 square feet for the grocery store in the new bldg
697208497214197761 2016-02-09 00:00:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @yaeltime @MarketUrbanism @ReporterLeslie it is binding. It's a city urban renewal plan from '81 http://parkslopestoop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/KEYFOODHISTORY.pdf
697207626396995584 2016-02-09 23:57:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @ReporterLeslie but Leslie might know better, idk
697207544490622976 2016-02-09 23:56:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism @ReporterLeslie apparently bc it's part of the Baltic Street Community Development Plan? per the press release at least
697207190357045248 2016-02-09 23:55:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> The Beep is in attendance at this Park Slope Key Food hearing, Tish James just spoke, Brad Lander is on his way
697194736357138432 2016-02-09 23:05:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin it always comes back to big box stores for some reason
697193507325415424 2016-02-09 23:01:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald thanks, i appreciate your support in my time of questionable career choices
697192996341747712 2016-02-09 22:58:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald idk why but everyone decided to have their meetings/hearings/press conferences this week and it's KILLING me
697192733719584768 2016-02-09 22:57:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @helfitzgerald hm yes this happened to me except i was sitting in a hearing at City Hall for six hours
697186736355569664 2016-02-09 22:34:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Mottel maybe! idk, send me the details
697186476518408192 2016-02-09 22:33:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> So glad that everyone decided that they wanted to have their Major News Event this week
697159354408116225 2016-02-09 20:45:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @erinmdurkin i jumped ship a little after 2 but props to you if you stayed
697137827662925824 2016-02-09 19:19:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> Developers are always quick to bring up the possibility that if you make it too hard to build, disinvestment/abandonment will return
697131234430951424 2016-02-09 18:53:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @CharmianNeary i'm not sure what you mean, but you can email or DM me if you have a specific question
697130584850767872 2016-02-09 18:50:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson @RobinGrearson  \_()_/
697127331148783618 2016-02-09 18:38:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold @EricDKoch and we haven't even gotten to public testimony yet!
697124212465598466 2016-02-09 18:25:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> Inez Barron asked what would be considered a reasonable rate of return to qualify for hardship; Been doesn't really answer her question
697119865317015552 2016-02-09 18:08:22 UTC <thecitywanderer> @powellnyt @HammerDaily @CharmianNeary if we're talking about projects with a large affordable housing component, it's somewhat less clear
697118635723264001 2016-02-09 18:03:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HammerDaily @powellnyt @CharmianNeary also most developers don't know their exact ROI going in, though they have an idea
697118533231185920 2016-02-09 18:03:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HammerDaily @powellnyt @CharmianNeary onus is on developers. for big affordable projects, city usually discloses cost and amt of subsidy
697116520888057856 2016-02-09 17:55:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HammerDaily @powellnyt @CharmianNeary you can't legislate that bc every project is different, but that's part of the discussion with HPD
697115384445562882 2016-02-09 17:50:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ not entirely sure. they renovated the station in recent years, maybe they have other improvements planned
697115274454106112 2016-02-09 17:50:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @HammerDaily @powellnyt @CharmianNeary @BilldeBlasio @TweetBenMax that's where the hardship waivers from BSA can be important
697111346668769289 2016-02-09 17:34:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson @RobinGrearson lots of the CM's demands are at odds w/each other... it would be problematic to tailor a citywide housing policy for everyone
697110895739142145 2016-02-09 17:32:43 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson @RobinGrearson the policies were never going to be popular & the admin knows that. And CMs know they can't put in provisions for every hood
697106439584751617 2016-02-09 17:15:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson @RobinGrearson it's been a six-month public approval process like every other rezoning. these policies were rolled out in spring/summer
697105855423102978 2016-02-09 17:12:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson @RobinGrearson and they are not going to vote this week; final hearing and vote is next month
697105626984554497 2016-02-09 17:11:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson @RobinGrearson there have been several prior hearings. Each community board, each borough board in all five boroughs, several DCP hearings
697103970972651521 2016-02-09 17:05:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @robingrearson @RobinGrearson they will have another hearing tomorrow; they want to have enough time today for members of public who've shown up to testify
697102029852962816 2016-02-09 16:57:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TishJames .@tishjames mentioned 250 Ashland, where most expensive affordable units go to families making up to $200Khttp://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2016/02/affordable-housing-nyc-brooklyn-fort-greene-250-ashland-place/
697100454484930560 2016-02-09 16:51:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Brad Lander brings up Certificate of No Harassment and whether that should be built into MIH
697100122484822016 2016-02-09 16:49:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> "We cannot have whole neighborhoods mapped with a MIH option where absolutely no low income units are required" - @bradlander
697096184712794112 2016-02-09 16:34:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold what about the constitutionality? Glen has mentioned it in passing
697096071097540608 2016-02-09 16:33:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> "No increase in allocation of section 8 in decades. Its virtually impossible to house someone [who makes $18K] w/o rental assistance" -Glen
697095490119270400 2016-02-09 16:31:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ Jumaane Williams
697088834425774080 2016-02-09 16:05:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> Now @NYCGreenfield brings up Bushwick Inlet Park, which was promised with '05 Williamsburg-Greenpoint rezoning.
697087691431739394 2016-02-09 16:00:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> Glen says a 421-a type subsidy will emerge during the legislative process in Albany bc city needs to incentivize rental housing construction
697086284649644032 2016-02-09 15:54:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> "Its not legal to impose job standards [i.e. union labor, minority biz] in a zoning text" says Alicia Glen
697085868583084033 2016-02-09 15:53:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ nope just here reporting
697084625068429312 2016-02-09 15:48:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> Glen: the city needs the off-site option in order for MIH to "pass constitutional muster." Only 10% of voluntary program has been off-site
697082639992418304 2016-02-09 15:40:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> "Where do you see this option being used [30% of units at 120% AMI]... because to us it spells displacement" - @DRichards13
697081314399412224 2016-02-09 15:35:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> She brings up the ELLA program, particularly in East New York, to require 10% of units at 30% AMI
697081038149984256 2016-02-09 15:34:05 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik thanks, I do!
697080882939760640 2016-02-09 15:33:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> Glen defends MIH's ability to create lower income housing
697052001839005697 2016-02-09 13:38:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> You'll be able to watch the MIH hearing live on the City Council website today if you're into that http://labs.council.nyc/land-use/mih-zqa/
696889767305355264 2016-02-08 02:54:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @TaylorLorenz @margarita @JohnKelly i feel like there's a certain taboo to asking "What do you do?" in New York, at least among Millennials
696885682803965956 2016-02-08 02:37:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @OlgaOksman lol sort of. more like her job is to convince him go to events that he doesn't really want go to go - parties, dinners, etc
696877773248425984 2016-02-08 02:06:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> My new roommate works in music PR, and her entire job appears to be babysitting a famous hip hop producer
696873410895466496 2016-02-08 01:49:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit this area was not rezoned
696865857608282112 2016-02-08 01:19:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ its mostly parties and fashion shows in the evenings, AFAIK
696865358272188416 2016-02-08 01:17:03 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ these public hearings are going to be long (they tend to last all day), and there is a press conference tomorrow afternoon too..
696864648537239552 2016-02-08 01:14:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday lobbyists and labor unions http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/02/8590389/ahead-council-vote-mayors-allies-organize-defense-housing-agenda
696864266159316992 2016-02-08 01:12:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit actually they probably are! Calculating the parking requirements for commercial projects is tough, but its usually quite high
696855069749280768 2016-02-08 00:36:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @petersterne yeahhhh there are a number of problematic things going on in this post
696850919674220544 2016-02-08 00:19:40 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito this could be the subhed to every real estate trend story ever
696842180888023040 2016-02-08 23:44:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik kind of! It allows more flexibility in the shape of the building. So  that could help with the facade design I guess
696841188414984192 2016-02-08 23:41:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito Felt like @MarketUrbanism would want to know. I wonder if it has anything to do w/ "softening" in resi market I've heard about
696840420102447104 2016-02-08 23:37:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> Noticing a distinct uptick in new office buildings filed in industrial zones
696840084004405248 2016-02-08 23:36:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JacobGarchik no. Fedders is a design choice. ZQA is about changing the setbacks and ceiling heights, particularly on ground floor
696817475506282496 2016-02-08 22:06:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kasperka @KaylaEpstein I will persist in being an old person who doesn't use it
696816026986680320 2016-02-08 22:01:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @KaylaEpstein lol I could not even get through this
696815316161191936 2016-02-08 21:58:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> Here is the protocol for the ZQA hearing on Wednesday at 9:30 am. I assume Tuesday's MIH hearing will be similar http://labs.council.nyc/land-use/mih-zqa/resources/zqa-hearing-protocol.pdf
696814740891369472 2016-02-08 21:55:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also, if you want to testify in front of the City Council on ZQA and MIH, head to those meetings that start early on Tuesday and Wednesday
696814023921287168 2016-02-08 21:53:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> Guys it's going to be a long few days! http://labs.council.nyc/land-use/mih-zqa/

696723734485463040 2016-02-08 15:54:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @spollck @capntransit thanks! i feel like someone else made a more up to date version of this map, but i need to hunt it down
696721391593398272 2016-02-08 15:44:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @spollck @capntransit so can someone easily live here without a car? i've never lived in this part of Queens so I wouldn't know
696719590127202304 2016-02-08 15:37:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @capntransit a mile from subway is pretty car-dependent. though i guess there are buses that run to the F on Hillside (idk how frequently)
696718028164239360 2016-02-08 15:31:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bookoisseur was this on construction fences?
696709936416477184 2016-02-08 14:59:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @jilliancyork kind of like how NYT writes Nycha, while the rest of the world writes NYCHA

696410088471425025 2016-02-07 19:07:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ not unless it has wheels, plumbing, electricity and a cute loft

696407487017308160 2016-02-07 18:57:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ltvsquad that's what i figured. now that i am finagling a little more on gmaps, seems like it was taken down during the gut in late 2013ish

696404659787976704 2016-02-07 18:46:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @newtownpentacle @ForgottenNY ok thanks. do you have any idea if the sign is still there? the building has been reno'd, expanded, converted
696402809470742528 2016-02-07 18:39:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> cc @newtownpentacle if you know the history/or what's up with the sign
696402699802296324 2016-02-07 18:38:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> Long Island City folks: is the cool old Apple Tag & Label sign gone? http://lostnewyorkcity.blogspot.com/2011/05/good-sign-apple-tag-label.htmlpic.twitter.com/MRMtXJc3Lo
696138498500358145 2016-02-06 01:08:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> Finally finished this excellently reported @NYTmag piece on the wreck of Amtrak 188 http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/magazine/the-wreck-of-amtrak-188.html?&moduleDetail=section-news-2&action=click&contentCollection=Magazine&region=Footer&module=MoreInSection&version=WhatsNext&contentID=WhatsNext&pgtype=article&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=157A1A6B04152EEE19FEA750946F8207&gwt=pay
696008988962459649 2016-02-06 16:34:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @chaykak also @MC_NYC recently wrote about fancy bricklaying for the Times http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/11/24/nyregion/bricklaying-a-nearly-lost-art-makes-a-comeback-in-luxury-buildings.html?referer=
696008154103070720 2016-02-06 16:30:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk @chaykak oh yes hand laid brick is allll the rage for fancy condos now http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/10/10-sullivan-street-nears-the-finish-line-in-soho.html
696007274960130048 2016-02-06 16:27:20 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak @ptrmsk also glass loses much more heat in winter and heats up rooms faster in summer, so brick tends to be more cost effective
696006000785149952 2016-02-06 16:22:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @chaykak @ptrmsk those gray Fedders buildings are the scourge of Bushwick
696005062670360581 2016-02-06 16:18:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ptrmsk depends on the neighborhood! But I think in BK there's getting to be a backlash against glass
695988474252390400 2016-02-06 15:12:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MattCaputo my replacement at Brownstoner is also doing a little series on the origins of neighborhood names
695835564784881664 2016-02-05 05:05:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism sure. but would enough properties fall into that category to pay for this thing? Probs not
695834848339083264 2016-02-05 05:02:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism so that would be on all the existing buildings along the route or only for new ones?
695833797816926208 2016-02-05 04:58:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> I'm wondering where mayor thinks new property tax revenue is going to come from for the streetcar. Hallets Point? http://observer.com/2016/02/a-streetcar-named-independence-de-blasio-invests-in-non-mta-transit/

695309169621131265 2016-02-04 18:13:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ whereas i fenced foil, which women have been allowed to fence since the 20s (go figure)
695308937877417986 2016-02-04 18:12:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ all i know is that saber was considered too violent for women and didn't really exist competitively till late 90s/early 2000s
695305618438152192 2016-02-04 17:59:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ idk what you mean about medal limitations but there wasn't any women's saber at the Olympics till '04

695296374598995968 2016-02-04 17:22:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> .@_grendan expresses how many of us feel abt streetcar proposal, which is a blatant giveaway to folks like Two Trees http://gawker.com/bill-de-blasio-wants-to-build-a-very-affordable-streetc-1756991741?utm_campaign=socialflow_gawker_facebook&utm_source=gawker_facebook&utm_medium=socialflow

695292077014413312 2016-02-04 17:05:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday just like Bushwick! Another original Dutch town with the word "bos" (tree), except it means "town in the woods"
695291311088353280 2016-02-04 17:02:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @johngpriest @artichoko the distribution of trash cans on Franklin was contentious bc biz owners are responsible when they overflow, etc
695291039213551616 2016-02-04 17:01:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @johngpriest @artichoko St Johns has a couple businesses but it doesn't really make sense on a resi block like that.
695289025821855744 2016-02-04 16:53:16 UTC <thecitywanderer> @johngpriest @artichoko i feel like we don't have that many on Nostrand, maybe on Franklin
695288507049320449 2016-02-04 16:51:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> These concrete condos in Boerum Hill are brutalist? Maybe? http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/02/revealed-371-baltic-street-boerum-hill-condos.htmlpic.twitter.com/9hzIxxMUd1
695274025124249600 2016-02-04 15:53:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome but most of these neighborhoods are pretty deeply NIMBY and wealthy, so it would be a big fight to get those rezonings passed
695273841979949056 2016-02-04 15:52:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome that's the plan for the Midtown East rezoning, so I feel like they could do something similar here, theoretically
695268716305596416 2016-02-04 15:32:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @JackSmithIV she was probably among the first generation of women to fence saber! it was really just starting 20 years ago
695262274928402432 2016-02-04 15:06:58 UTC <thecitywanderer> Given that women fencing saber at the Olympics is still a pretty new phenomenon, the more interesting part is that she's a POC & a saberist
695261467663286273 2016-02-04 15:03:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> Been seeing lots of coverage of Ibtihaj, an amazing lady Muslim saberist who's going to fence at Olympics in a hijab http://www.buzzfeed.com/tamerragriffin/fencer-first-us-athlete-to-compete-in-hijab-at-olympics#.aaeVwvJKV
695259371249524736 2016-02-04 14:55:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rbrome they are already major backers! let's just be transparent about it then!
695258807090462720 2016-02-04 14:53:11 UTC <thecitywanderer> I would feel much better about this BK-Queens streetcar route if developers building along the route helped fund at least half of it
695118363513720832 2016-02-03 05:35:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @coreykerchner I wonder why Twitter is asking me if I want to translate this from Romanian
695093406230528000 2016-02-03 03:55:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @bldgblog there are other neighborhoods that sorely need $2.5 billion in transit spending much more than wealthy areas along the waterfront
695090741966721024 2016-02-03 03:45:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @j0ncampbell damn i don't think i ever tried their food, but the bartenders did like to give me random buybacks, which was great
695089895753277440 2016-02-03 03:41:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @j0ncampbell also RIP the bar that it's replacing!

695084189629222912 2016-02-03 03:19:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold a full block on Classon between Pacific and Dean! Jesus. Hopefully that will get rid of the disgusting chicken slaughter house
695077299054632960 2016-02-03 02:51:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ it's like talking to your mom but more compelling, which is what people secretly want from an advice columb
695072262676946945 2016-02-03 02:31:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ she is long-winded! But I like it. Very pro-lady power/taking control of your life/giving no fucks
695060989604188163 2016-02-03 01:47:08 UTC <thecitywanderer> I hated advice columns until I found Heather Havrilesky's Ask Polly, which is consistently wonderful http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/02/ask-polly-why-did-my-dream-man-dump-me.html
695044417997119488 2016-02-03 00:41:17 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ or strange and vaguely upsetting
695041542457856002 2016-02-03 00:29:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ @MarketUrbanism nope

695027950505345029 2016-02-03 23:35:51 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito idk why they haven't thought of bringing back some of the old streetcar/elevated routes that didn't run along the water
695027362694619136 2016-02-03 23:33:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito if this actually moves forward, i imagine/hope we'll see studies from folks like RPA and CBC
695026575100796928 2016-02-03 23:30:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito objective analysis of what? who benefits?
695026317725687809 2016-02-03 23:29:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito and no doubt Doug Steiner is a fan
695026154344992768 2016-02-03 23:28:42 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito i mean NYT doesn't hide it, they mention Two Trees as a big backer (and they benefit twice bc they own Dumbo of course!)
695013861771108352 2016-02-03 22:39:52 UTC <thecitywanderer> @Azi i think you live right around the corner from me, and fwiw none of these coffee shops were here when i first moved here!
695002729656246272 2016-02-03 21:55:37 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism unsurprising

694912374583750656 2016-02-03 15:56:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @vksmith i feel like its exactly the same now, except the rents are even higher.

693141181539225600 2016-01-29 18:38:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kristoncapps since if you can argue it's non-contributing, then developer can argue it's worthy of a tear-down for something 10x the size
693140717301006336 2016-01-29 18:36:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kristoncapps basically only buildings considered non-contributing here are garages and buildings that have literally zero historic features
693140448571957248 2016-01-29 18:35:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kristoncapps sure. in new york, apartment buildings are considered contributing basically as long as they date back far enough
693139596411047937 2016-01-29 18:32:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kristoncapps why would they be non-contributing?
693137014691139586 2016-01-29 18:21:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kristoncapps the counter-argument is usually that historic districts preserve older buildings with existing "affordable" housing
693136390880632832 2016-01-29 18:19:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @kristoncapps most preservationists here would argue that these arguments are the ones employed by the real estate lobby, esp on aff hsg

692764704951922688 2016-01-28 17:42:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @PetroPubPolicy that seems pretty likely, given the cost of building that tall. they might also have to use union labor if they want 421a

692195028530270208 2016-01-26 03:58:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> And I think it was the first time I've heard someone claim that neighbors are being displaced by bike lanes
692194550136315904 2016-01-26 03:56:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism she also asked CAN WE GO AROUND AND COUNT HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DISPLACED BY THESE BIKE LANES
692194038863282181 2016-01-26 03:54:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism seriously though she was even more upset about DOT wanting to remove the left turn, which had nothing to do with bikes
692193815483060225 2016-01-26 03:54:00 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism hm yes i remember this story
692193756221685762 2016-01-26 03:53:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> She was also enraged that DOT wanted to remove the left turn at St Johns & Utica because several pedestrians have been hit there
692193447520911361 2016-01-26 03:52:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> When to a CB meeting about new bike lanes on my block, and of course there was one belligerent lady who compared them to colonization

692136369607557120 2016-01-26 00:05:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rolandlisf sure. But it seems like thats not what the state law requires, right? Or does the state require that it be 100% affordable?
692133576528232450 2016-01-26 23:54:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rolandlisf so was the deal breaker that they didnt have enough affordable housing or that it wasnt for low enough income families?

691075786091171840 2016-01-23 01:51:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito surprised you haven't made him your avi yet
691034758839668736 2016-01-23 23:08:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @trcyzee we can't go anywhere so WHY NOT
691007730614734849 2016-01-23 21:20:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ yup that sounds right. hatches are a good clue bc they are usually at least 500-1000 feet from nearest station
691005144843079680 2016-01-23 21:10:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ well i can tell you there's a fun (semi-abandoned?) IND substation just north of Stanton, and a hatch http://forgotten-ny.com/2012/10/ind-substations/
691000325738778624 2016-01-23 20:51:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ChrisLInoa if someone on your block ordered delivery, they are going to hell
690999604888932353 2016-01-23 20:48:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ wouldn't that make the platform like two blocks long? i'm skeptical but i guesssss it's possible
690994364844220416 2016-01-23 20:27:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> @fordm you have a nice view
690994186246582275 2016-01-23 20:27:06 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ which platforms go up to Stanton? the F?
690992907365584896 2016-01-23 20:22:01 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ also, the stations and tracks in LES have been reconfigured several times over the years bc they cut down service
690992197517340673 2016-01-23 20:19:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ no, MTA intentionally does not publish those maps (or track maps, lol). there's an app called Exit Strategy that kind of has it
690989576819740672 2016-01-23 20:08:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ do you mean like the actual station layouts?
690987026552901632 2016-01-23 19:58:39 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ the system is so old and strange that there are tons of oddities, abandoned stations/track sections/tunnels/lower levels
690986596569587712 2016-01-23 19:56:57 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ fwiw, no subway track maps are completely accurate, but those are the best i've found. Few MTA officials know the whole system
690985730580070400 2016-01-23 19:53:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ sections underneath Prospect Park and Central Park are rock tunnels. Believe Q is one set of tracks, F/G has a lower level
690985107436494850 2016-01-23 19:51:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ this site has good track maps, and his book map is even better (if you're really interested) http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway_Track_Maps
690982970459602944 2016-01-23 19:42:32 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ like god forbid a train ever broke down underneath Prospect Park on the Q or F/G - a long stretch of track
690982694696656896 2016-01-23 19:41:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @rachelholliday lol what is he doing
690981947611430913 2016-01-23 19:38:28 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ before they install heaters in the switches, it would be good if we had tracking on all the trains! baby steps
690981764815257600 2016-01-23 19:37:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ interesting. idk if we have any heaters at all? could hit up the construction folks at MTA
690981428302090240 2016-01-23 19:36:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> Also no G service south of Bergen, no JMZ, no L east of Myrtle-Wyckoff, no 3 east of Utica, no B/Q/D service in Bklyn, no A east of Euclid
690980505228046337 2016-01-23 19:32:44 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ cool! yeah too much of our system still has wood and random crap in the tracks. also obviously dangerous underground
690980273861844993 2016-01-23 19:31:49 UTC <thecitywanderer> If you live in southern Brooklyn, Astoria or anywhere off the 7 train, be home by 4! No F service south of Jay St https://www.ny.gov/sites/ny.gov/files/atoms/files/UndergroundMapwServiceGuide.pdf

690978408273178625 2016-01-23 19:24:24 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ is this how they clear tracks of snow in the midwest?

689878702482677760 2016-01-20 18:34:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> People seem to have a lot of '60s nostalgia about Ceasar's Bay Shopping Center in Gravesend http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/01/gravesend-mall-plans-a-big-expansion-at-1684-shore-parkway.html
689869551316660224 2016-01-20 17:58:12 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism but hey if it works in Union Square Park, that would be nice at least
689869470920265728 2016-01-20 17:57:53 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MarketUrbanism i always worry about my ability to watch TV on the corner of 17th and 3rd
689869232419573761 2016-01-20 17:56:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SoBendito @SallyGold oh hey i didn't realize Jeff Koons' new building was next to the stables. funny.
689866921249017856 2016-01-20 17:47:45 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold Hard to say! The West 52nd Street ones could be desirable, West 38th Street def more trouble than its worth
689865261269254145 2016-01-20 17:41:10 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MC_NYC still waiting for the brokers to embrace RAMBO lol
689864667125190657 2016-01-20 17:38:48 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold those West 38th St stables are next to an open rail cut and on top of the Lincoln Tunnel. Would be challenging to develop
689862866040700928 2016-01-20 17:31:38 UTC <thecitywanderer> @RosaGoldensohn if you live in fort greene, you kind of do!
689862510997037058 2016-01-20 17:30:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Not sure how I feel about these finshttps://twitter.com/newyorkyimby/status/689847680198184960
689862094162923520 2016-01-20 17:28:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @stefanoschen i'd still be pretty worried about security, despite the encryption they have in place
689860927395663872 2016-01-20 17:23:56 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ our publisher lives down the street from the jenga tower and whenever i go there to see him, i see that building and laugh
689859795948605441 2016-01-20 17:19:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @ISANobody_ you like the jenga tower better than WTC? why?
689672511508877312 2016-01-19 04:55:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Very good @tylercoates on writing about your personal life https://medium.com/matter/the-80-20-rule-fecfd5c397c4#.ptouarvco
689669560052662276 2016-01-19 04:43:31 UTC <thecitywanderer> @plitter totally justified
689669208670601216 2016-01-19 04:42:07 UTC <thecitywanderer> @SallyGold this is a weird Timesian headline
689668480229097472 2016-01-19 04:39:13 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj it was well underway by the time i arrived in 2008
689668371474993152 2016-01-19 04:38:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj i'm sure they have; it's not a new phenomenon
689668284233465856 2016-01-19 04:38:27 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj yeah seems like $2 more. i'm willing to get soup from Xi'an & eat it in Tompkins Sq Park next to the hobos like a real New Yorker
689667767209967616 2016-01-19 04:36:23 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj is it more expensive though?
689667312673230849 2016-01-19 04:34:35 UTC <thecitywanderer> @smithsj but how was the food
689666742285656064 2016-01-19 04:32:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lainnafader that's pretty normal for coops
689666221042720769 2016-01-19 04:30:15 UTC <thecitywanderer> Real estate reporting for the @lainnafader crowd https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160119/upper-west-side/dogs-get-final-say-growing-number-of-real-estate-decisions
689665968767909888 2016-01-19 04:29:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> When your bf asks you if he should buy this, you get a little worried https://www.instagram.com/p/BAdv9aAjUUG/
689643737585184769 2016-01-19 03:00:54 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini they don't publish up to date data, and their press office certainly couldn't give it to me for last calendar yr
689643265797312513 2016-01-19 02:59:02 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini i asked them for their percentage of on time approvals, and they couldn't even furnish it
689642648307630080 2016-01-19 02:56:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini institutions & homeowners wouldn't oppose landmarking if it didn't make maintaining property difficult & $$$
689642330090016768 2016-01-19 02:55:19 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini whatever. that's a matter of opinion. what isn't is the fact that they are wildly inefficient.
689642126708248577 2016-01-19 02:54:30 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini and the fact that poorer/non-white neighborhoods are still a much lower priority...landmarking is like lobbying
689641825632653314 2016-01-19 02:53:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini sorry *more expensive, not more efficient
689641689011589120 2016-01-19 02:52:46 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini and ultimately the way the process is set up makes it more efficient in the long run, both to build new or alter
689641574607818752 2016-01-19 02:52:18 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini and a former LPC commissioner told me this herself, that they are slow and it makes it hard to get anything done
689641367719514112 2016-01-19 02:51:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini not overly deferential. if anything, they're generally picky, inefficient, slow, tho they're getting better
689640437037023233 2016-01-19 02:47:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BJArduini @dieterknickbock you can fight for the concept of landmarking all day, but the way LPC handles things is a big sticking point
689640182400847872 2016-01-19 02:46:47 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini honestly you can be pedantic about the prop values if you want, but none of this addresses the underlying issues
689637610306867200 2016-01-19 02:36:33 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BJArduini @dieterknickbock it makes me a little sad because i would love to see more affordable housing in landmarked bldgs, but too $$
689637368312283140 2016-01-19 02:35:36 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BJArduini @dieterknickbock yeah affordable housing and landmarking don't mix often, unfortunately, unless you're a rent controlled tenant
689636945681584128 2016-01-19 02:33:55 UTC <thecitywanderer> @BJArduini @dieterknickbock in general it does! especially in brooklyn. if a few years of covering BK real estate has taught me anything...
689635567605321729 2016-01-19 02:28:26 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini all the papers say landmarking increases property values, which is what the furman paper says, except for in Mnh
689634193211531265 2016-01-19 02:22:59 UTC <thecitywanderer> @lemonsand SO MUCH MORE
689632023300960257 2016-01-19 02:14:21 UTC <thecitywanderer> @dieterknickbock @BJArduini yes, i read the IBO piece, and the conclusions are similar to the Glaeser/Been piece from the Furman Center.
689614125907992576 2016-01-19 01:03:14 UTC <thecitywanderer> Glad that my years of studying Greek and Roman mythology are paying offpic.twitter.com/7Izh4tTaI1
689613704174899202 2016-01-19 01:01:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MariusHollenga @WhoresofYore @whatkatie_did not surprisingly there are some overlapping stories http://www.thaliatook.com/OGOD/accalarentia.html
689613578773630976 2016-01-19 01:01:04 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MariusHollenga @WhoresofYore @whatkatie_did some people say Acca Larentia was also an old Etruscan fertility goddess linked with wolves
689612949753860096 2016-01-19 00:58:34 UTC <thecitywanderer> @MariusHollenga @WhoresofYore @whatkatie_did Some people think it may have been Acca Laurentia, the wife of the shepherd who found them
689610666131472384 2016-01-19 00:49:29 UTC <thecitywanderer> @whatkatie_did @WhoresofYore that's also why people think Romulus and Remus were nurtured by a she-wolf... except maybe it wasn't a wolf!
