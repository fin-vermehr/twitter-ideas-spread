970249470297411585 2018-03-04 10:47:54 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews One assumes that this means our negotiators have thus far been unable to convince them of such.

969896980582367232 2018-03-03 11:27:14 UTC <iaink85> I think this is an excellent thread.https://twitter.com/jamesmb/status/969567274486124544
969896766496796672 2018-03-03 11:26:23 UTC <iaink85> @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @jamesmb Really enjoyed reading that. Major was voted out when I was 11, so wasn't really aware of him as an MP, but his speech at the Creative Industries was superb. Conversely, I've never heard JRM say anything that didn't cause me to think about just how out of touch he is.

Italy, etc, in order to address our concerns and achieve something concrete regarding the EU's structure and mandate.

968886757562441728 2018-02-28 16:32:58 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @rob_nellie That self-study is always defined as 'guided' though - i.e. students study the material, and then seek guidance via seminar/tutorial with the academics. The tuition isn't just lecture time. Also, the self-study costs a lot (resource subscriptions, library, buildings, IT, etc).
968871076167143425 2018-02-28 15:30:39 UTC <iaink85> @CCHQPress Labour were 8 years ago. Unless you're going to provide context with other metrics (usage of the NHS, budget, beds, etc) this is pointless.
968867496278286336 2018-02-28 15:16:26 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Students generally do 120 credits per year, which corresponds to a nominal 1200 hrs effort. Lectures/tutorials/seminars/labs might be only about 300 hrs? So do you divide the fee by the effort and give them 2 hrs pro-rated back? That'd be about 15.
968866982463492097 2018-02-28 15:14:23 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews I think it's rather difficult to put a monetary value on a particular lecture. Students are expected to read around the subject and absorb all other supplementary and support materials. In this, the actual lectures are not a massive part of the learning.

968058559152971776 2018-02-26 09:42:00 UTC <iaink85> @DMReporter So Corbyn pushing CU is a snub to the (minority of) Labour voters who voted out? Then DM presumably sees the entire Brexit process as a snub to the (much larger and narrower) 16.1m minority who voted to Remain.

967475725782708226 2018-02-24 19:06:02 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump 1) Armed Educators are not (and should not be) a thing.  2) Given that loads of these shooters know that they're not coming out alive, it won't deter.   3) If you're intent on pushing this, you should define what 'success' for the programme would be right now.
967351912059326464 2018-02-24 10:54:03 UTC <iaink85> @Stormzy1 @DMReporter @AndyVale Indeed - a good point. One usually criticises the government because one thinks they're preventing the country being as good as it can be. Patriots criticise the government when it needs it.

965637234572570624 2018-02-19 17:20:32 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky I meant the not marking 'Easter' on the box was a ridiculous falsehood. If you're saying that had nothing to do with it, then fair enough.
965637011158773760 2018-02-19 17:19:38 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky Hardly objective, and no external sourcing. Pass.
965634175943495680 2018-02-19 17:08:22 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky Because you saying you acted based upon a ridiculous falsehood annoyed me. But, you doubled down on the other side of it, so I guess I shouldn't have bothered.
965632554136145921 2018-02-19 17:01:56 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky I'm not that interested in the discussion either tbh - I thought I'd show that the not mentioning Easter part is rubbish though. Always enjoy people saying 'do the research'....seems like there's always a bit more research you want doing.
965630853375250434 2018-02-19 16:55:10 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky I know what it means, chief. Someone certified that muslims can eat it. Oh #pennydropped Is that a problem for you?
965630169842143233 2018-02-19 16:52:27 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky Nope. I got it. Why does Halal certification bother you in this case? Of course chocolate is Halal...
965629393652592642 2018-02-19 16:49:22 UTC <iaink85> @kylegriffin1 Surely someone needs to pay for a brass band and some banners for when he brings up the century?
965629091138494464 2018-02-19 16:48:10 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky Because of the halal thing or the Easter thing? If Halal, then it's weird because of course cocoa beans, cocoa butter, sugar and lecithin are Halal. If it's Easter, then it's more awkward...as it;s engraved on the eggs themselves.https://twitter.com/AreUForRealBro/status/965627509227376640
965627943258124288 2018-02-19 16:43:36 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner I hear water's Halal as well. Maybe they'll boycott that?

That is, one should have the right to freedom (or not being held against one's will), water, shelter, food, free speech......and being able to get a gun?

964061165050564609 2018-02-15 08:57:47 UTC <iaink85> It's often said that immediately after a tragedy is the wrong time to talk about #guncontrol.  In that case, the US should definitely now talk about it in the context of such discussion and action being before the next inevitable mass shooting. Do something before it's too late.
964051573050626049 2018-02-15 08:19:40 UTC <iaink85> @conradhackett Is there anything particularly special about N. Dakota, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire and Alaska? Or just relatively low population density?

963002077051047937 2018-02-12 10:49:21 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob Agree. I wonder what the value is specifically for urban areas? Given most news is urban(London)-centric, it may give a different impression that people map on to all situations, even in rural settings. It'd still be an overestimate, but closer. Interesting to see media power.
962963076399190016 2018-02-12 08:14:23 UTC <iaink85> @Digbylj Use of the word 'Remoaners' marks you as not worth listening to on this. 'Please heed my instruction and justification after I insult you' isn't a good tone.

The 'change your views or be crushed' argument seems the least American thing possible, especially given recent campaigns to push democracy in the Middle East.

957591568327827456 2018-01-28 12:29:55 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy Is Northern Ireland included in the weighting here, or is the data an undersell for remain? Couldn't find explanation in the data tables.
957584456793186304 2018-01-28 12:01:40 UTC <iaink85> @bbcnickrobinson @nickreeves9876 @JulieLeyGibbs I feel like that, but if they ignored it, 17million people would feel they're being ignored. We need to ensure that we keep pushing so significant numbers realise Brexit is awful. Many will have been swayed by NHS funding - Boris et al should be constantly reminded of their lies.

I went to Dachau in August - one of the most harrowing places I've ever seen - gave me a very different perspective on my rather comfortable life.
957282074972614657 2018-01-27 16:00:06 UTC <iaink85> @FreeSpeechGB So lies are fine because voters ignore them anyway?

953776876132229120 2018-01-17 23:51:42 UTC <iaink85> @joshrogin So.....rather than engage with lawmakers directly, there's a paradigm wherein the president tweets stuff and it may end up progressing through Congress?

953747950374617089 2018-01-17 21:56:45 UTC <iaink85> @LordAPolls @mikegalsworthy It's phrased sneakily: 'what would happen?' as opposed to 'which way would you vote?'. Lot of grey area for people to say people are making a prediction rather than saying what they'd actually do.

If Britain genuinely thrives, then we'll maybe bemoan some of the things we'd miss (e.g free movement, strict environmental regs) but be glad the NHS, etc, can be funded properly. Not sure I can see it yet though.

952934060082581504 2018-01-15 16:02:39 UTC <iaink85> @spellar Was it 1 vote per member? Or could they choose multiple candidates? The numbers sum to 315005 (55% turnout based on dec 2017 membership) - is this a normal degree of engagement, or lower/higher than usual?
952853761986301953 2018-01-15 10:43:34 UTC <iaink85> @danwootton @SunApology Sun losses last year - 60m. Weirdly, reported by the guardian, although they don't seem to be taking perverse pleasure in it.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/05/the-sun-losses-advertising-hacking-charges-profits-revenues
952723138575560705 2018-01-14 02:04:31 UTC <iaink85> @timminchin You sing it fast...maybe it couldn't keep up.
952655119836958721 2018-01-14 21:34:14 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy @olivercolwell We definitely agree on that part (defending the status quo). A positive campaign about the benefits that we get and the positive impact that the UK can have is infinitely better than just taking every Leave argument and saying it's rubbish.
952650622045696001 2018-01-14 21:16:22 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy @olivercolwell I also think that people realise that our government is worryingly inept, and that they (as expected) will try to profit themselves rather than getting the best deal for the UK. Even soft leavers may abstain if asked again if the alternative was May government fulfilling Brexit.
952650076073218054 2018-01-14 21:14:12 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy @olivercolwell I agree with you RE addressing some of the issues, but in general I think that a difference maker could be that people are now better informed (i.e. they understand better our impact on the EU and the impact on the UK for leaving).
952649753552211968 2018-01-14 21:12:55 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy @olivercolwell I'm not sure - there will have been complacent remain supporters (who didn't believe we'd leave) and apathetic leave supporters (who didn't believe they could win). I assume turnout would be even higher this time, but I don't know which way it'd swing.
952647508622217217 2018-01-14 21:04:00 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy @olivercolwell How else does one try to get Labour to change their tack on this without criticising their current position?

952511995533824001 2018-01-14 12:05:31 UTC <iaink85> @AngelaHanks @timbuc @rrockman @CarolineDoodles Indeed - there will be people who are just dicks and try to (man/down/other)splain to whoever is talking, but that's probably evenly distributed to M/F. It's the fact that loads of others just mansplain that shows that women's opinions are frequently disregarded/ undervalued.

951734688833523712 2018-01-12 08:36:46 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Great call, mate. Saves loads of people from having to (1) travel to London, and (2) buy outsized protesting stationery.

951584229091151872 2018-01-11 22:38:54 UTC <iaink85> @jamesrbuk Given the phrasing, one assumes that as long as men don't have vaginal sex with other men, things should be fine for 39?

948149569271025664 2018-01-02 11:10:47 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob @CasMudde Did he specifically say 'teaching fellow'? If so, i guess it means a different thing at those institutions, because for us it's very much a non-student position. Our PhD students can also act as Postgraduate Teaching Associates, not fellows.

936873577013395457 2017-12-02 08:24:01 UTC <iaink85> In the 18th Century, the US declared 'no taxation without representation' in breaking from Britain. Millions are now represented in name only.

It'd be like a political party in another country using Jayda Fransen as an example to describe all UK citizens as backward, hateful morons.

935271840670539776 2017-11-27 22:19:17 UTC <iaink85> @charltonbrooker No, sure, that's cool. I mean, you're just ruining the Christmas TV-watching plans, but it's no biggie. It's not like the prospect of 2017wipe was the only reason to sit through 2017 itself.pic.twitter.com/SG6RYeIceV
935266521944920064 2017-11-27 21:58:09 UTC <iaink85> @ProfBrianCox I approve of that update in the tweet quoted, primarily because my brain always isolated 'twit' first, and so got a little confused by what 'shi' does to it.
935226119028199424 2017-11-27 19:17:37 UTC <iaink85> @MrEdByrne Spar? What a diva.

934792435640782848 2017-11-26 14:34:18 UTC <iaink85> @arobertwebb Occasionally find it hard to remember that I apparently have such a massive influence on the economy. Not sure which mechanism is responsible for this.

934568693488672770 2017-11-25 23:45:14 UTC <iaink85> @amazon @scrowder Which is exactly what Alexa actually tells you if you ask in, you know, our non-fake universe.
934566249916502016 2017-11-25 23:35:32 UTC <iaink85> @piersmorgan Piers, there's a message saying you're a hypocrite. It's on my voicemail but I'm sure you can get it.
934499063659102208 2017-11-25 19:08:33 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump You as well? I reckon they're saying it to all of us as some kind of powerplay! Good on you for declining - means the odds of my winning are higher!

933403678278643712 2017-11-22 18:35:53 UTC <iaink85> @drmistercody It's good to be thorough. One can write pages of symbolic logic to prove 1+1=2. If something is correct and important, it's sometimes necessary to spend time to get it right - so *everyone* finally gets onto the same page.

928327851711049728 2017-11-08 18:26:22 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Seems legit. One should always refer to one's female friends as 'Sugar Tits' - it's the key to lasting and rewarding friendships and definitely doesn't indicate that one is a prick.

923488058162458627 2017-10-26 09:54:45 UTC <iaink85> @OzzyManReviews @Poita316 Good shout. Reckon that should be 'shitmixed' though. Otherwise it's a really determined person getting things thoroughly blended together.
923445796078538753 2017-10-26 07:06:49 UTC <iaink85> @Larawithabird On the plus side, your crystal clear context means I now know what 'baller' means...cheers!

921875076944887808 2017-10-21 23:05:20 UTC <iaink85> @ASlavitt @SenGillibrand Genuine question: why only vulnerable children? Why does the US not take the view that children in general should get coverage regardless?
921855191632285696 2017-10-21 21:46:19 UTC <iaink85> @ramzpaul In your scenario, maybe try a non-sexual advance initially mate. Move on to the further stages after acknowledging her as a person.

921709799758286848 2017-10-21 12:08:35 UTC <iaink85> @MarieAnnUK @iam_DRS Remember that in this example, they'd also cut your hours after the fall out (economy worth less) so you'd have less money in real terms.
921673899871481856 2017-10-21 09:45:56 UTC <iaink85> @ASlavitt Lack of a comma implies you perceive Ryan as human. Bold take at the moment.

920704684561715200 2017-10-18 17:34:37 UTC <iaink85> @DavidBedwell Yup. Also belies a desire to shift attention away from suffering women. Same as the 'not all men' -type responses.

920069110452678656 2017-10-16 23:29:04 UTC <iaink85> @eelarson @ZTracer @sangerkatz So if a provider could prove a recently manifest condition was likely present since birth, coverage would be invalid? That's appalling.
920064482503806976 2017-10-16 23:10:41 UTC <iaink85> @SadiqKhan @LondonFire @daddymchill May be easier for girls to aspire to the profession if they're not being quietly dissuaded by the use of 'fireman' though.

918009338744262656 2017-10-11 07:04:16 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob @stefanstern @iainmartin1 Which is the ultra- remain attitude? Saying leavers were lied to, or implying the front bench believe their actions to be detrimental to UK?
917787572440616960 2017-10-10 16:23:03 UTC <iaink85> @ellardent I reckon that 3 million years from now (or 3 million and 29?), Red Dwarf will still be on Dave at 9pm on Thursdays.

917109584657043457 2017-10-08 19:28:58 UTC <iaink85> @johnredwood As an early-career researcher, I like that I have options to apply for posts at EU research institutions if I so choose.
917109252417826817 2017-10-08 19:27:39 UTC <iaink85> @johnredwood Young people presumably like the options provided by a right to freedom of movement. Will this be maintained?
916427263528357889 2017-10-06 22:17:40 UTC <iaink85> @NadineDorries Boris is doing a pretty good job of destroying himself on his own.
916424800888815618 2017-10-06 22:07:53 UTC <iaink85> @NickBoles Given that it seems other countries could be lining up to pick UK clean during our 'negotiations', we'd welcome someone, you know, strong.
916416352956665862 2017-10-06 21:34:19 UTC <iaink85> @OzzyManReviews disappointed not to hear a reference to Destination Fucked in your Samsung voiceover, chief...
916277270070923264 2017-10-06 12:21:39 UTC <iaink85> @DMReporter Don't worry Tom, your corneas might still be great, chief.
916083322710831104 2017-10-05 23:30:58 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson @Lowenaffchen Presumably stuff doesn't fit in it on the first attempt and he has to turn things around twice first. #moodkiller
915980647134646272 2017-10-05 16:42:59 UTC <iaink85> @ian_a_jones It was $1.51 to the pound on 5/10/2015. Apart from the Brexit vote, is there anything else that contributed to this behaviour?
915728423825395714 2017-10-04 00:00:44 UTC <iaink85> @daraobriain Just tell one joke in a recursive manner, like some insane humour fractal.
915721845961355264 2017-10-04 23:34:36 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson @G_Brain_Dentist I know, but still feels that's the way it's going. Centre getting smaller and population getting older.
915720061977075719 2017-10-04 23:27:30 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson Lol, we have single payer in the UK, and if anything, we're getting more and more right-wing, depressingly.
915678251275755520 2017-10-04 20:41:22 UTC <iaink85> @arobertwebb Well hey, what's a bit darker after that burning picture that creeped me the fuck out?
915662226186530816 2017-10-04 19:37:41 UTC <iaink85> @DMReporter I reckon that user's IP address would map to a Mr. B. Johnson.

915185472095375360 2017-10-03 12:03:14 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy I bet said bus has an asinine or demonstrably false slogan.
914994363733770241 2017-10-02 23:23:50 UTC <iaink85> @PrisonPlanet @thecjpearson @MonsterMavenG Erm, the thing about that is that the great French city of Manchester hasn't been in France for a very long time.

913656941234225152 2017-09-28 06:49:24 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNaga @BBCBreakfast @SamJ3193 @SimonPinsa In a way it hasn't. When it comes up against something it can't fight well enough, you need antibiotics.
913653658675548160 2017-09-28 06:36:21 UTC <iaink85> @benadamx @iheartliterati And those who didn't expect the shirt to be in ternary.
913653224539860992 2017-09-28 06:34:38 UTC <iaink85> 2) those who realise that such extrapolation can be dangerous if the predictive model doesn't accurately account for all function behaviour?
913498630027345922 2017-09-28 20:20:20 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob The list:  (1) Blue passports (to be made in EU) (2) Jam (3) Curry (not traditionally an EU dish)

913497672773980160 2017-09-28 20:16:31 UTC <iaink85> @Channel4News Finally, someone's hit on the main issue: is there enough local redundancy in the nation's future curry solution?
913460840745062400 2017-09-28 17:50:10 UTC <iaink85> @StephenMangan @MartinBelam Downtown...Iraq? Iraq being notorious for being majority town, of course.

913372123191762944 2017-09-28 11:57:38 UTC <iaink85> @susie_dent To be on a mard or to have a mard are also enjoyable uses.
913152550001618944 2017-09-27 21:25:08 UTC <iaink85> @StanCarey 'Use'?

913070900295225344 2017-09-27 16:00:41 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob @LBC @PadraigConnors Not quite - his opinion is what matters in this case (it's his show after all). He's more than balanced by Farage on LBC.
913065893323829249 2017-09-27 15:40:47 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob @LBC @PadraigConnors Erm, he feels Brexit will disadvantage more people than it will advantage? Hence he opposes Brexit bc he's on the side of British people.
913059562672021504 2017-09-27 15:15:38 UTC <iaink85> @whimsicella Has she declined an honour, or is it just a horrific oversight that she has no MBE or the like yet?

912256471030751234 2017-09-25 10:04:26 UTC <iaink85> Finally did @CrystalMazeHQ. It was AWESOME and our Maze Master was superb. Everyone should go. Go. Go now. Childhood dream realised.
912237517084217345 2017-09-25 08:49:07 UTC <iaink85> @SimoneGiertz Bet the resulting Flesch-Kincaid score is higher than Trump's average.

912062380640817152 2017-09-24 21:13:11 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson I guess you think you tweeted this just after it happened. Given the delay in the story, how long have you really been sat with your phone?
912035049624743941 2017-09-24 19:24:35 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson @twinkcommunist @GardenerMellors Add some 7ths and 9ths and it can sound okay... still agree with you though.
911678796788588544 2017-09-23 19:48:57 UTC <iaink85> @RonJichardson You haven't employed a water guy yet? Good man - stay humble.
911328196758523904 2017-09-22 20:35:48 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Dude, you voted to leave the EU. EVERYTHING else is up for negotiation.
911215999709597696 2017-09-22 13:09:58 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @Simstersnose True story. That's what i was getting at, unfortunately.
911179391887138816 2017-09-22 10:44:30 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews It'd only be a matter of time before one 'felt scared' and ended up shooting a BAME person for not showing their hands fast enough. No guns.
911173099722362880 2017-09-22 10:19:30 UTC <iaink85> @SunApology Must not betray 17.4m, but must apparently ignore 16.1m. Seems legit.
910981021130280960 2017-09-21 21:36:15 UTC <iaink85> @ProfBrianCox They're a five-a-side team that nobody wants to play against.

910771468367253504 2017-09-21 07:43:34 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Do gun owners all only have a single issue about which they care? Your statement makes no logical sense.

910451587289686017 2017-09-20 10:32:28 UTC <iaink85> @SunApology @gateaumon I bet he posted his article on the Twitter.
910255742829113344 2017-09-19 21:34:15 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump You say these things so easily. Does the idea of being responsible for the deaths of innocents affect you? Do you think abt it? You should.

909456603862257664 2017-09-17 16:38:45 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @In2020Vision Even so, this is about the Foreign Secretary wilfully lying after multiple instances of censure.

909455374469812224 2017-09-17 16:33:52 UTC <iaink85> @UKStatsAuth @faisalislam @fishytaste @hoddydod70 @Dr_Daff Imagine you signed up to a contract that normally costs 350, but you only pay 270. If you cancel, you don't suddenly get 350 to spend.
909359139574501377 2017-09-17 10:11:28 UTC <iaink85> @spellar I asked you a genuine question. How do we avoid it? If other countries do, how do they get around it? Resent being patronised by my MP.
909327157062664193 2017-09-17 08:04:23 UTC <iaink85> @spellar The Sun is good at being rather vague while making people angry. No detail/explanation. If they're regulations, how do bureaucrats avoid?

909117524398297094 2017-09-16 18:11:23 UTC <iaink85> @DMReporter Given that inflation is at 3% and rising, these people (and us in general) can buy less and less with their millions.

909097967403126784 2017-09-16 16:53:40 UTC <iaink85> @PolakPolly @martyjsay Would that be relevant? Doing a specific set of tasks 40-hrs a week doesn't trump reading massively about the subject and analysing data.
909073982896459776 2017-09-16 15:18:21 UTC <iaink85> @katystoll They all cross 2 months, right? You can't even get that... super useless
909025769598410752 2017-09-16 12:06:47 UTC <iaink85> @ProgMagazineUK Not a single mention of any winners though?! Oh well - too much to hope for I guess.
908995504717156352 2017-09-16 10:06:31 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @JLG_1882 Well, yeah...? Not enough characters to suggest they also continue to accept my passport/DL.
908955180456202240 2017-09-16 07:26:17 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Make the ID free and easily accessible, and maybe I agree. Disenfranchising people who can't afford passport or DL is also not good.

908694340498837504 2017-09-15 14:09:48 UTC <iaink85> @ProfBrianCox Didn't know 'alien searching' was your particular research field....
908662558059585537 2017-09-15 12:03:30 UTC <iaink85> @PrisonPlanet @WendyHolland2 Depends what you're protesting. If you want more police funding, then get out and say so, but if you're protesting immigration, we'll argue.
908660419048419328 2017-09-15 11:55:00 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Either you're speculating or privy to info that hasn't been released publicly in UK for good reason. Be sensible & don't hinder search.

907978004474802176 2017-09-13 14:43:20 UTC <iaink85> @LBC @mrjamesob @LiamHalligan @butlerrichard2 You really think Brits wouldn't want troops defending EU civilians just because some politicians don't give us favourable treatment?
907864158741430277 2017-09-13 07:10:57 UTC <iaink85> @CommonsSTC @KingTekkers @DlanodTmurp Plenty of girls in Chemical Engineering (though still not parity) who enjoy it and my PhD advisor was a woman - the world needs that.
907863861549772800 2017-09-13 07:09:46 UTC <iaink85> @CommonsSTC @KingTekkers @DlanodTmurp Jesus - wasn't saying that. Just saying that girls aren't encouraged enough to do STEM.

907609222711578630 2017-09-12 14:17:55 UTC <iaink85> @CommonsSTC @KingTekkers @DlanodTmurp I hope we can change that by directing STEM subjects much more towards girls at a young age.
907608889587388418 2017-09-12 14:16:36 UTC <iaink85> @CommonsSTC @KingTekkers Given that from what I can tell only 2 have a STEM degree, we clearly have very strange criteria, even before we talk equality.

897896326666563584 2017-08-16 19:02:21 UTC <iaink85> @ddlovato You'll lose the pricks but gain some good ones.
897895281114697728 2017-08-16 18:58:11 UTC <iaink85> @PEEBZ_B @ljsmigger92 So long the writing's started to degrade.
897764557493612544 2017-08-16 10:18:44 UTC <iaink85> @number10gov Presumably you're standing with the decent US people and legislature? Because the executive sure as hell isn't against racism.

897731549650718720 2017-08-16 08:07:35 UTC <iaink85> @Kathbum Is that guy a metaphor for the UK? If so, sorry.....
897407850456260609 2017-08-15 10:41:19 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Such a spineless response.
897373805999534080 2017-08-15 08:26:02 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Still can't believe it's legal to use a phone while driving there.

896068464007233536 2017-08-11 17:59:04 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew I like to ask them if their mothers' are ashamed of them. It can get interesting reactions!

895568463648915456 2017-08-10 08:52:15 UTC <iaink85> @Larawithabird So... only competent musicians should be able to post incorrect charts?
895309099595960321 2017-08-09 15:41:38 UTC <iaink85> @NuclearTakes There's a problem. They'll need more specialist intel.pic.twitter.com/8WrN5Jc1hg
895230256445104130 2017-08-09 10:28:20 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Go visit Nagasaki and Hiroshima before you decide on what your 'action' will be. Seriously, it's important.
894926075230334980 2017-08-08 14:19:37 UTC <iaink85> @rtyson82 Rule 86 of the internet is that for every Trump statement, there is an equal and opposite statement.
894924190700232704 2017-08-08 14:12:08 UTC <iaink85> @virgiltexas Breaking: 'Knowing something in one's heart' not the same as knowing something.

893606895600226304 2017-08-04 22:57:40 UTC <iaink85> @susie_dent - thought you might be interested to know that @bethhh_k and I have decided that the plural of weetabix is weetabices.

892862637549268993 2017-08-02 21:40:16 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @ChristianCkb21 Red herring given that we have 10% of MEPs, at least 5% of civil servants and a veto. We're not being ruled.
892432568301309953 2017-08-01 17:11:19 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner How long after them getting their country back can I ask for my country (the one of openness and international co-operation) back?
892432134509666304 2017-08-01 17:09:36 UTC <iaink85> @AmberRuddHR @ukhomeoffice Ask them about the hashtag thing. They might know.

891836690117033986 2017-07-30 01:43:31 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Gotta admire his stamina. You'd think being so angry/paranoid/insane all the time would be exhausting.
891833949613424640 2017-07-30 01:32:37 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @ianhamilton1982 Have this one. This one's very good.

890319564520792064 2017-07-26 21:15:00 UTC <iaink85> @WheelOfTimeFans Presumably he meant 'Kaf?'
890216515412389888 2017-07-26 14:25:31 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @BBCBreaking Because reasons.
890212043076272129 2017-07-26 14:07:45 UTC <iaink85> @BrandyLJensen Just as one can prove there are infinitely many integers by always adding 1, remember he can always say/do one more hateful thing.

889828400222924801 2017-07-25 12:43:17 UTC <iaink85> @ian_a_jones Are all of the seats different? Absolutely don't dispute the survey, just interested to see if similar seats get similar grades.

888985130605391872 2017-07-22 04:52:26 UTC <iaink85> @TellMamaUK Given that most tweets are either links to MSM news stories or replies to people who tweet directly, it's hard to see what this even means.
888979326384918529 2017-07-22 04:29:22 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @SunApology "Ok Jackson, you've had 3 days, where's my Lineker dirt?"  "Erm, he went to a Starbucks...?"  "God damn it Jackson....."
888977571152580609 2017-07-22 04:22:24 UTC <iaink85> @SunApology @MikeShaunGlover That, and ppl like to get out of the hotel anyway. Ridiculous.
888976219148079105 2017-07-22 04:17:01 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews What a wonderful fucking world this is.
888975813806313472 2017-07-22 04:15:25 UTC <iaink85> @AllanIshacNYC @pauloCanning I volunteer to do it using MS Paint if they're interested.

888973769326424065 2017-07-22 04:07:17 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner He should've said 'full disclosure'. 'Full transparency' would be leaving them where they are.
888755080954081281 2017-07-22 13:38:18 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Here is a thing, but don't think about the thing when there is this other (less bad) thing. FAKE NEWS! #moron
887798172902445056 2017-07-19 22:15:53 UTC <iaink85> @bengoldacre @TKMarx @rhiannonrains Not sure tbh, was just trying to give benefit of doubt. V hard for those physical jobs to move without large national programmes to help
887712587978346498 2017-07-19 16:35:48 UTC <iaink85> @bengoldacre @TKMarx Think the original tweet assumes a necessity to switch careers in some cases.
887174058797936640 2017-07-17 04:55:53 UTC <iaink85> @JimMFelton I like how you can see the moment the other parties stare at David Davis and just think 'what the fuck are you playing at?'

886921222973517824 2017-07-17 12:11:12 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @SunApology It's okay, I didn't need to sleep ever again anyway....
886309133510746112 2017-07-15 19:38:58 UTC <iaink85> @EE Hard to do that when DMs don't work for non-followers.
886238035460972544 2017-07-15 14:56:27 UTC <iaink85> @EE - apparently I can set up a voicemail pin by calling VM and selecting '3'. Unfortunately your VM tells me this before hanging up on me.
885919535714402304 2017-07-14 17:50:51 UTC <iaink85> @PrincessBravato @nowthisnews @donberrino By being a bot or similar. Most tweets are spam.

885666499083603968 2017-07-13 01:05:22 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Lol - it was hydraulic fluid.
884890453103054849 2017-07-11 21:41:39 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner This one opens the doors, this one shoves the stuff out?
884534276607422464 2017-07-10 22:06:20 UTC <iaink85> @Kathbum @isabellasemanas Presumably there are circumstances in which you can fight in single combat and absorb her Twitter handle. Like Highlander or something

883255336626515968 2017-07-07 09:24:16 UTC <iaink85> @spellar Would you be willing to ask Mr Corbyn (erstwhile rebel) a) if he condones this, and b) what he plans to do to address this type of thing?
883087926766260233 2017-07-06 22:19:03 UTC <iaink85> @MaraWilson Presumably it asked for a more respectful tone before responding?
883002810400460801 2017-07-06 16:40:50 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @islandniles Feel like UK is gonna be the guy on Civilisation games who finally researches Iron Working when everyone else is in the Space Race.
882999788907749376 2017-07-06 16:28:49 UTC <iaink85> @SkyCricket sorry Michael Holding, 54 secs isnt 0.54 minutes! It's 0.9 mins. Start of your calculation would be 78.3 mins for 87 overs. :-D
882739583301058560 2017-07-05 23:14:51 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @2dAmMuslim Presumably the more he looks like he supports Trump, the more he offsets a possible extradition to the US if he ever leaves the embassy?
882731009736921089 2017-07-05 22:40:47 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @LOLGOP Presumably a significant proportion of those 2 groups are the same people.
882597310911438848 2017-07-05 13:49:31 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner They're 'pro-birth'. Don't give a shit about making sure there is adequate social provision to ensure that the babies might have a 'life'.

878301233907478528 2017-06-23 17:18:26 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @AncientSpoonbil After all, climate change is either happening or it's not. 50/50! /s

877983673710247941 2017-06-22 20:16:34 UTC <iaink85> @StephenMangan It's the guy from that band. Aragon or something.
877850062050607106 2017-06-22 11:25:39 UTC <iaink85> @bbclaurak @IBrasso @anthonyleahy That's on Cameron too - I reckon neither side thought the electorate would actually vote out. Complacency (& obv hubris) started everything.
877614593207443457 2017-06-21 19:49:58 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Did Reps get together with Dems on healthcare?
877611925441531904 2017-06-21 19:39:22 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner The replies on that thread are fucking depressing. Time to bring back #spellcheckaracist
877466356534435841 2017-06-21 10:00:56 UTC <iaink85> @MetroUK @MICHAEL13056654 @DavidWoodhead26 A bit of a sweeping generalisation - not helpful.
877465092387897347 2017-06-21 09:55:55 UTC <iaink85> @MetroUK @MICHAEL13056654 @DavidWoodhead26 Read again. Not disputing existence of some posts. But some people are saying they automatically vote twice 'cause registered in 2 places.
877462780785418241 2017-06-21 09:46:44 UTC <iaink85> @MetroUK @MICHAEL13056654 Well....yes, clearly, but I don't think it's an offence punishable by custody.
877446495288602628 2017-06-21 08:42:01 UTC <iaink85> @MetroUK @MICHAEL13056654 Being able to vote in either of 2 locations is not the same as being able to vote twice. Any person that did committed a criminal offence.

877425910714179584 2017-06-21 07:20:13 UTC <iaink85> @AdamBienkov @wilkes_nat Given that the Maybot called the GE precisely to give us a hard Brexit with no opposition, I doubt this would go down well with Tory HQ!
877279507945840640 2017-06-20 21:38:28 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews I just had to steady myself on the mantelpiece. They should be ashamed of themselves. #thinkofthechildren

876721025152667648 2017-06-19 08:39:15 UTC <iaink85> @BBCBreakfast @BBCNormanS @Deadloud Presumably he'll be charged with murder and multiple counts of attempted murder. The cited offence was correct at time of arrest.

868888404947329025 2017-05-28 17:55:13 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump 1 of your favourite phrases in speeches & interviews is 'some people are saying....'. I imagine similar logic works there - never happened.

859787970118914052 2017-05-03 15:13:20 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Maybe true - but if a policy is only to describe it as such after authorities do, then the problem lies there. Like I said, I don't know.

859782773904732160 2017-05-03 14:52:41 UTC <iaink85> @AdamBienkov @notlistenning1 Meh - if they launched with something positive about their own policies rather than an attack ad, this opportunity wouldn't have arisen.

856508782427459584 2017-04-24 14:03:01 UTC <iaink85> @IFSClimbing Is there footage of anyone (e.g. routesetters) topping men's 1?
856138209679618048 2017-04-23 13:30:30 UTC <iaink85> @GoldingBF @LeeChapman18 This is now on the labour manifesto. Just FYI.
856136472461795332 2017-04-23 13:23:35 UTC <iaink85> @TelegraphNews Link to ORB data and sampling base for this? Not on their website from what I can see.
856133082360971264 2017-04-23 13:10:07 UTC <iaink85> @jeremycorbyn @BBCNews Lol, 3hrs later and this is still up. Guess you don't read replies.
855897103633133574 2017-04-22 21:32:25 UTC <iaink85> @neiltyson @shadokastur0776 @Alex_the_jones Thought the whole point was that they went back to his tomb and it was open and empty? Ergo, nobody witnessed it and he appeared later?
855890288191078400 2017-04-22 21:05:21 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump My hypocrisy meter and irony meter have both just exploded. Read climate science literature and drill some sense into your administration.
855532489049350150 2017-04-21 21:23:35 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Someone just needs to tell him to make the comments first, and finish with the question...
855064018175881217 2017-04-20 14:22:02 UTC <iaink85> @almurray @BBCPolitics And your campaign, obviously.
855063878161620992 2017-04-20 14:21:29 UTC <iaink85> @BBCPolitics Up for standing again, @almurray? Your TV show in 2015 was great.
855061581633396736 2017-04-20 14:12:21 UTC <iaink85> @RedDwarfHQ Would anybody like any toast?
855050929183363072 2017-04-20 13:30:02 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff @meg_e_t So....infinitely more golf?
855049973716668416 2017-04-20 13:26:14 UTC <iaink85> @WheelOfTimeFans Finding it very hard to get excited about this. So much scope for not doing it justice...
854853111260827651 2017-04-19 00:23:58 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner If so, crosses line between unhinged and despicable.
854763969701085190 2017-04-19 18:29:45 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson @8bitonionring The presumed anticipation on their part makes it. #slowburn

854658009062154240 2017-04-19 11:28:42 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @MichaelPDeacon To have GE, doesn't parliament have to be dissolved? What are they going to be elected to? It'll be just them as the single MP?
854475951413002241 2017-04-18 23:25:16 UTC <iaink85> @hendopolis @BBCNews Did they mean to make her look positively unhinged? She may as well be monologuing to 007 whilst holding a cat.
854377459789295616 2017-04-18 16:53:54 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @Shelleymillwar2 I'd say the options are depressing rather than the election itself. Compared to some countries, we're lucky to be able to choose.

853728699128176641 2017-04-16 21:55:58 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @lachlan New hobby: Tell Trump supporters that Obama did something super shady. Then when they get mad, reveal that it was Trump after all.
853579187831132160 2017-04-16 12:01:51 UTC <iaink85> @VictoriaCoren 'Tears and Tambourines' vastly inferior to 'Baffled by all the Talk' as a title....especially for an Only Connect! fan!

852153305824407552 2017-04-12 13:35:55 UTC <iaink85> @yellowcardigan I reckon that if they genuinely think their Twitter feed could be used to discredit them, they should stop saying moronic things on Twitter.
852148820096024576 2017-04-12 13:18:05 UTC <iaink85> @IFSClimbing Great news - Meiringen was my first time watching live and it was brilliant.
851894724462075906 2017-04-11 20:28:24 UTC <iaink85> @LeaveEUOfficial @DrewEdgar_CB Lol. Have you heard of 'missionaries'? That was literally their sole purpose.
851876442656919552 2017-04-11 19:15:45 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner I miss having to push statues onto switches in police stations.

850678086093897729 2017-04-08 11:53:55 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @Curtisdivorce Not fake though - you just think it's irrelevant? Fake news is a different thing.
850671783787339776 2017-04-08 11:28:52 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @Curtisdivorce In what sense?

849413815817076737 2017-04-04 00:10:09 UTC <iaink85> @Chartoc @Kysubae Batshit crazy, dangerous and sick. Also, doesn't he realise that he already has a non-bullshit way of detecting part of EM spectrum? (Eyes)

847392091520905216 2017-03-30 10:16:33 UTC <iaink85> @DigitalSneeze @onceablue76 thought tis was by definition a time for de-unification?
847158207185403905 2017-03-29 18:47:10 UTC <iaink85> @LouiseMensch always loved that analogy. Average lifespan of butterfly = 1 month.
847129894454792192 2017-03-29 16:54:40 UTC <iaink85> @marcusbrig they were completely baked after Article 47. Wait til you get to Article 84 - it's a doozy.
847128254054064132 2017-03-29 16:48:09 UTC <iaink85> @BorisJohnson 'deep and special' won't catch on, Boris - it's creepy.
847127658966212608 2017-03-29 16:45:47 UTC <iaink85> @alaindebotton pssst! Theresa! You wrote 'deep and special partnership' a few too many times. #unimaginative #theyrejustnothtatintous
847126531184975875 2017-03-29 16:41:18 UTC <iaink85> @marcusbrig @faisalislam more concerned about 'deep & special partnership' being repeated 7 times. Just sounds creepy. Who thought of that?
846920419206746114 2017-03-28 03:02:17 UTC <iaink85> @hendopolis @BBCNews @karlako23 they're quoting the headline. Like they do for all the front pages. Every day.
846442910061088769 2017-03-27 19:24:50 UTC <iaink85> suggest you start w/ PGP, then go from there....The Code Book by @SLSingh can give basic grasp of the maths and is superb.

845208077590777858 2017-03-24 09:38:03 UTC <iaink85> @Jezebel "A lot of information may be learned..." depends on how you rate his capacity for learning. I nominate that for redaction as well.

844981730637484034 2017-03-23 18:38:38 UTC <iaink85> @Mediaite thought free will was a thing to these people. Don't women get to exercise free will regarding intention to have a child?
844922816252272640 2017-03-23 14:44:31 UTC <iaink85> @markke11y any chance of a go-pro recording your playing for a few songs? Finding it hard to learn some of the recent ones!

844296362900553729 2017-03-21 21:15:13 UTC <iaink85> @GaryLineker it's confirmation bias, chief. Left media sees 'too much' coverage of Farage. Right - opposition to Brexit. Reality: centre-ish
844243669406441472 2017-03-21 17:45:50 UTC <iaink85> @whatifnumbers @elipongo coincidence? For anyone else, I'd say yes. But Randall...? Not a chance.

843924953506500608 2017-03-20 20:39:22 UTC <iaink85> @RoyalJordanian @ReedusCanadafan does the 'combined flight' thing imply transit via US?
843897628635086848 2017-03-20 18:50:48 UTC <iaink85> @seanspicer @BBCJonSopel I'm gonna go with 'unconvincingly', just like every other briefing.
843896921618071554 2017-03-20 18:47:59 UTC <iaink85> @StephenMangan he taught me that there's no market for UHT milk because it's shite.

842860649726300160 2017-03-17 22:10:13 UTC <iaink85> @SpeakerRyan what does it feel like to (even though you may feel it makes economic sense) introduce a bill that you know will kill people?
842854648008597505 2017-03-17 21:46:22 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff @mirzam_nimu @shna23 imposter syndrome can be a tough thing to deal with.
842853397187477507 2017-03-17 21:41:24 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff @Fayettetopia @BelieveinGod321 if one wore a tinfoil hat, would the ear bug signals rattle permanently around one's brain?
842524249927630848 2017-03-16 23:53:29 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @richardosman prob for the best. Last time some1 as tall as u went through immigration, he was retrieving a galaxy in Men In Black.

842097554212954114 2017-03-15 19:37:56 UTC <iaink85> @georgeeaton @lensgrdr Yeah, I know - meant it's possible to be strong on both. Strong on tax hike, automatically strong on PMQs.
842048142493265920 2017-03-15 16:21:36 UTC <iaink85> @georgeeaton @lensgrdr but in asking difficult Qs about tax hikes and u-turns, he would hold gvt to account, while also looking good in PMQs
842045722887360513 2017-03-15 16:11:59 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff just mean that if they hadn't have waited, WH wouldn't've had opportunity to pre-empt (to make leak by WH less suspected?)
842045172045213696 2017-03-15 16:09:48 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff if MSNBC'd broken into programmes to cover them, would've been different though? Why WH pre-empt if leaked? Steal thunder?
841927310253146112 2017-03-15 08:21:27 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews this is our own antisemitism. Deflecting it on to Trump ignores UK-grown racism. Trump may embolden, but we need to deal.
841799541519208448 2017-03-14 23:53:45 UTC <iaink85> @maddow recent financial years? Or like, the 90s or something?

839675983376580608 2017-03-08 03:15:29 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Presumably an interesting follow-up to Revolving Doors @PrivateEyeNews
839541962814402560 2017-03-08 18:22:56 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Given Brexit campaign twisting, presumably we could use as: "I'm also in favour of a second referendum....." - Farage, 2017
839230361297117185 2017-03-07 21:44:44 UTC <iaink85> @bbcthree a) that's awesome, b) she makes moves I can only dream of, and c) path to good things at the Olympics in Tokyo?
838857745268887553 2017-03-06 21:04:06 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff @DanaMStanley after the throw, more like Ryan. Sees the problem, does absolutely nothing to try to avoid it.

836638768660631554 2017-02-28 18:06:41 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff - I gave BoD to that one partially as rep leaning could be split. 67% don't say trump though!
836637958472142850 2017-02-28 18:03:27 UTC <iaink85> @HotlineJosh @realDonaldTrump we can cherry-pick too. Q19, 66% don't consider you honest enough to say you're honest. 18% right temperament!
835859970981834752 2017-02-26 14:32:01 UTC <iaink85> @jeremycorbyn then vote against it and make them change their policy?
835745279030734848 2017-02-25 06:56:16 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @EversFam I don't think people are saying there weren't lots of people, just refuting 'biggest crowd' claim.
835738168385208320 2017-02-25 06:28:01 UTC <iaink85> @dennistaylor147 de facto legitimisation that will be seen around the world. It's fair game.
835735517757063170 2017-02-25 06:17:29 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump for a businessman, you don't seem to know much about economics. Have you heard of #impostersyndrome ?
835364636421566464 2017-02-24 05:43:44 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @BBCNorthAmerica i guess horrific policies are fine until he dreams one up that involves something about which you care.

834067929662648321 2017-02-21 15:51:05 UTC <iaink85> @Nigel_Farage did you mean 'anyone who says there isn't a problem has different data (or interpretation thereof) and we should discuss.'?

831437388127809536 2017-02-14 09:38:15 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew @boggybrn yeah, I stood corrected on that one it seems!

831429695455522817 2017-02-14 09:07:41 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew @ed_davies fair enough. Misremembered something I read maybe. Scale up by factor of 10 to account for mileage change.
831304657804865539 2017-02-13 00:50:49 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew - kinda late tho, so I could be wrong. Clearly renewable sources preferable, just running the calc on the Fail's premise. (2/2)
831304271308193792 2017-02-13 00:49:17 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew - I calc single 3200MW nuc plant powers 26m e-cars (ave 15000 mile/year) & 90 mile/kWh in 60days operation (ideal). (1/2)

830006166306562048 2017-02-10 10:51:05 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump - mate, I think you left caps lock on. There's a 'shift' key, you know - it'll mean you only capitalise the 1st letter.

828762615711199232 2017-02-06 00:29:39 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump - presumably people would be happy to accept that if you tell them about the 'accumulation of data' to which you refer.

765237319876087808 2016-08-15 17:22:49 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump that might also be true if you were intelligent or had a remotely sensible worldview. Hint: Stop saying horrific things.
763000405634715648 2016-08-09 13:14:07 UTC <iaink85> @GabbyLogan @AlexKJTimes - not sure an appeal to hypocrisy is mitigation. Genuine point, but rephrase as if it's not a follow-on excuse.

742256102360948736 2016-06-13 07:23:39 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump you being smart would be nice. Maybe you could just, I don't know, read a credible history text? It'd enlighten you. #dunce
741999090674900992 2016-06-12 14:22:23 UTC <iaink85> @nassercricket Therefore reviewing if a bowler incorrectly called for nb might be unfair on batter? Prob not so in Hales case though (2/2)
741998874945019904 2016-06-12 14:21:32 UTC <iaink85> @nassercricket Re Hales - does calling a nb give batter chance to change shot? i.e. hears nb and decides to do something different? (1/2)

705306023578492928 2016-03-03 08:17:14 UTC <iaink85> @BBCEngland Unsure what article's point is - provoke anger? It's 0.024% of total spent. Is that high? No context. Every1 deserves legal aid.

970249470297411585 2018-03-04 10:47:54 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews One assumes that this means our negotiators have thus far been unable to convince them of such.

969896980582367232 2018-03-03 11:27:14 UTC <iaink85> I think this is an excellent thread.https://twitter.com/jamesmb/status/969567274486124544
969896766496796672 2018-03-03 11:26:23 UTC <iaink85> @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @jamesmb Really enjoyed reading that. Major was voted out when I was 11, so wasn't really aware of him as an MP, but his speech at the Creative Industries was superb. Conversely, I've never heard JRM say anything that didn't cause me to think about just how out of touch he is.
969872709265121282 2018-03-03 09:50:47 UTC <iaink85> @HealthUntoDeath @SteveGTI Yes, but there will also be needless tariffs, so you will pay more for that lesser quantity, so...yay?

969662778528104448 2018-03-02 19:56:36 UTC <iaink85> @CCHQPress Then Remain. Maintain our position and power, then  commit to negotiating with Germany, France, Spain, (soon to be rather right wing?) Italy, etc, in order to address our concerns and achieve something concrete regarding the EU's structure and mandate.
969597638256537600 2018-03-02 15:37:45 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump ...don't people want that stuff that they're buying though?
969305199134289921 2018-03-01 20:15:42 UTC <iaink85> @Ham15h711 @ProfBrianCox Seems like his position is to avoid stating one until Tories fail, May resigns and we have another GE, whilst hoping his approval ratings don't drop too far in the meantime due to his lack of opposition. I have no respect for this position.
969283874424606722 2018-03-01 18:50:58 UTC <iaink85> @daraobriain You might as well get in the Dragon now, chief.

968937676450738176 2018-02-28 19:55:18 UTC <iaink85> @RomeshRanga Any chance this has been remixed to include MarioKart BGM samples?
968886757562441728 2018-02-28 16:32:58 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @rob_nellie That self-study is always defined as 'guided' though - i.e. students study the material, and then seek guidance via seminar/tutorial with the academics. The tuition isn't just lecture time. Also, the self-study costs a lot (resource subscriptions, library, buildings, IT, etc).
968871076167143425 2018-02-28 15:30:39 UTC <iaink85> @CCHQPress Labour were 8 years ago. Unless you're going to provide context with other metrics (usage of the NHS, budget, beds, etc) this is pointless.
968867496278286336 2018-02-28 15:16:26 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Students generally do 120 credits per year, which corresponds to a nominal 1200 hrs effort. Lectures/tutorials/seminars/labs might be only about 300 hrs? So do you divide the fee by the effort and give them 2 hrs pro-rated back? That'd be about 15.
968866982463492097 2018-02-28 15:14:23 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews I think it's rather difficult to put a monetary value on a particular lecture. Students are expected to read around the subject and absorb all other supplementary and support materials. In this, the actual lectures are not a massive part of the learning.

968058559152971776 2018-02-26 09:42:00 UTC <iaink85> @DMReporter So Corbyn pushing CU is a snub to the (minority of) Labour voters who voted out? Then DM presumably sees the entire Brexit process as a snub to the (much larger and narrower) 16.1m minority who voted to Remain.

967475725782708226 2018-02-24 19:06:02 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump 1) Armed Educators are not (and should not be) a thing.  2) Given that loads of these shooters know that they're not coming out alive, it won't deter.   3) If you're intent on pushing this, you should define what 'success' for the programme would be right now.
967351912059326464 2018-02-24 10:54:03 UTC <iaink85> @Stormzy1 @DMReporter @AndyVale Indeed - a good point. One usually criticises the government because one thinks they're preventing the country being as good as it can be. Patriots criticise the government when it needs it.

966649505159569411 2018-02-22 12:22:56 UTC <iaink85> @toddstarnes Didn't the FBI immediately take some responsibility? Why would they further berate an institution that admitted it could have done more?

965637234572570624 2018-02-19 17:20:32 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky I meant the not marking 'Easter' on the box was a ridiculous falsehood. If you're saying that had nothing to do with it, then fair enough.
965637011158773760 2018-02-19 17:19:38 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky Hardly objective, and no external sourcing. Pass.
965634175943495680 2018-02-19 17:08:22 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky Because you saying you acted based upon a ridiculous falsehood annoyed me. But, you doubled down on the other side of it, so I guess I shouldn't have bothered.
965632554136145921 2018-02-19 17:01:56 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky I'm not that interested in the discussion either tbh - I thought I'd show that the not mentioning Easter part is rubbish though. Always enjoy people saying 'do the research'....seems like there's always a bit more research you want doing.
965630853375250434 2018-02-19 16:55:10 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky I know what it means, chief. Someone certified that muslims can eat it. Oh #pennydropped Is that a problem for you?
965630169842143233 2018-02-19 16:52:27 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky Nope. I got it. Why does Halal certification bother you in this case? Of course chocolate is Halal...
965629393652592642 2018-02-19 16:49:22 UTC <iaink85> @kylegriffin1 Surely someone needs to pay for a brass band and some banners for when he brings up the century?
965629091138494464 2018-02-19 16:48:10 UTC <iaink85> @Uptotherewithit @ShazaTukky Because of the halal thing or the Easter thing? If Halal, then it's weird because of course cocoa beans, cocoa butter, sugar and lecithin are Halal. If it's Easter, then it's more awkward...as it;s engraved on the eggs themselves.https://twitter.com/AreUForRealBro/status/965627509227376640
965627943258124288 2018-02-19 16:43:36 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner I hear water's Halal as well. Maybe they'll boycott that?

Seems that's a non-starter there though - a shame.

964416558566064129 2018-02-16 08:30:00 UTC <iaink85> @TomiLahren In 2017, there were 346 mass shootings. It's essentially 1 per day. When exactly should people get angry about it? When's a good time for you?

That is, one should have the right to freedom (or not being held against one's will), water, shelter, food, free speech......and being able to get a gun?
964415313000382464 2018-02-16 08:25:03 UTC <iaink85> @jaketapper @MookieMurray @johnlaserbeams @jwoodatty1 Yeah, I read that when it was above as well. Removal of the ability to own a gun would result in 5 of those being redundant (if the gun is the weapon used to commit said acts).

Given most news is urban(London)-centric, it may give a different impression that people map on to all situations, even in rural settings. It'd still be an overestimate, but closer.

958374089202204673 2018-01-30 16:19:23 UTC <iaink85> @DPJHodges He then reassured everyone that the exact same forecasts predict growth in all scenarios. So the forecasts are crap when taken to show that growth is actually lower than it'd be if we remained in the EU, but they're fine when just focusing on the growth part. Weird.

953777685083426816 2018-01-17 23:54:55 UTC <iaink85> @bengoldacre Presumably basic 'how' is still useful though? For example, it may be possible to quickly established that a device essentially runs on fairy dust (like that bomb detection machine), making the searching for evidence a little moot.
953776876132229120 2018-01-17 23:51:42 UTC <iaink85> @joshrogin So.....rather than engage with lawmakers directly, there's a paradigm wherein the president tweets stuff and it may end up progressing through Congress?
953766121911578624 2018-01-17 23:08:58 UTC <iaink85> @hendopolis @BBCNews Not sure why they decided to print 'Rumpy Trumpy' over 'Trumpy Pumpy'...people might've been eating, I guess.

953748546121076736 2018-01-17 21:59:07 UTC <iaink85> @LordAPolls @mikegalsworthy Also, if taking it as which way people would vote we still need to respect the fact that 8% remainers have changed and try to understand why. Apathy?
953747950374617089 2018-01-17 21:56:45 UTC <iaink85> @LordAPolls @mikegalsworthy It's phrased sneakily: 'what would happen?' as opposed to 'which way would you vote?'. Lot of grey area for people to say people are making a prediction rather than saying what they'd actually do.

Just like we're not thorough with reclaiming for medical expense from other EU nations when EU citizens use the health insurance card here.

I hope there'll be no insidious watering down of regulation and that they come up with something thorough and sensible. The continued free movement will be subject to negotiation I guess. Hope that also continues.

If Britain genuinely thrives, then we'll maybe bemoan some of the things we'd miss (e.g free movement, strict environmental regs) but be glad the NHS, etc, can be funded properly. Not sure I can see it yet though.

952655119836958721 2018-01-14 21:34:14 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy @olivercolwell We definitely agree on that part (defending the status quo). A positive campaign about the benefits that we get and the positive impact that the UK can have is infinitely better than just taking every Leave argument and saying it's rubbish.
952650622045696001 2018-01-14 21:16:22 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy @olivercolwell I also think that people realise that our government is worryingly inept, and that they (as expected) will try to profit themselves rather than getting the best deal for the UK. Even soft leavers may abstain if asked again if the alternative was May government fulfilling Brexit.
952650076073218054 2018-01-14 21:14:12 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy @olivercolwell I agree with you RE addressing some of the issues, but in general I think that a difference maker could be that people are now better informed (i.e. they understand better our impact on the EU and the impact on the UK for leaving).
952649753552211968 2018-01-14 21:12:55 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy @olivercolwell I'm not sure - there will have been complacent remain supporters (who didn't believe we'd leave) and apathetic leave supporters (who didn't believe they could win). I assume turnout would be even higher this time, but I don't know which way it'd swing.
952647508622217217 2018-01-14 21:04:00 UTC <iaink85> @mikegalsworthy @olivercolwell How else does one try to get Labour to change their tack on this without criticising their current position?

952511995533824001 2018-01-14 12:05:31 UTC <iaink85> @AngelaHanks @timbuc @rrockman @CarolineDoodles Indeed - there will be people who are just dicks and try to (man/down/other)splain to whoever is talking, but that's probably evenly distributed to M/F. It's the fact that loads of others just mansplain that shows that women's opinions are frequently disregarded/ undervalued.

951584229091151872 2018-01-11 22:38:54 UTC <iaink85> @jamesrbuk Given the phrasing, one assumes that as long as men don't have vaginal sex with other men, things should be fine for 39?

948149569271025664 2018-01-02 11:10:47 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob @CasMudde Did he specifically say 'teaching fellow'? If so, i guess it means a different thing at those institutions, because for us it's very much a non-student position. Our PhD students can also act as Postgraduate Teaching Associates, not fellows.

939938075291062272 2017-12-10 19:21:15 UTC <iaink85> @TellMamaUK You'd think that lot would also want to give their money to a good, old-fashioned, down-to-earth British carrier, rather than propping up the Irish! #hypocrites #maybetheyliketheEUafterall
939869218392236032 2017-12-10 14:47:38 UTC <iaink85> @bengoldacre @VincentN15N17 The same. He was on #screenwipe once providing a rather colourful rebuttal about sticking flashlights up one's arse. N.B. ReBUTTal wasn't intentional here but I'm glad it happened.

936873577013395457 2017-12-02 08:24:01 UTC <iaink85> In the 18th Century, the US declared 'no taxation without representation' in breaking from Britain. Millions are now represented in name only. They have no voice & will see taxes increase while R donors see decreases. This farce makes me feel slightly better about UK government.https://twitter.com/PattyMurray/status/936850378989043712
936562490787364864 2017-12-01 11:47:52 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob @BenChu_ @JonnyLus @SPricey32 Easier for commentators to push a narrative if all people on one side believe the same things in some polarised view of politics. Ironically, similar to the US system.

936032067078557697 2017-11-29 00:40:10 UTC <iaink85> @drmistercody He's right, in fairness. How many presidents insulted vets, retweeted Britain First, or repeatedly antagonised a nuclear state? Nobody can compete with the cretin.
936029226762940417 2017-11-29 00:28:52 UTC <iaink85> @LoveTheScript7 @daraobriain I guess he can now screenshot the tweet and put that in instead...

935266521944920064 2017-11-27 21:58:09 UTC <iaink85> @ProfBrianCox I approve of that update in the tweet quoted, primarily because my brain always isolated 'twit' first, and so got a little confused by what 'shi' does to it.

930138271027486721 2017-11-13 18:20:19 UTC <iaink85> @seanhannity @drmistercody Your comma game is completely on point here.
929790171486347264 2017-11-12 19:17:06 UTC <iaink85> @greg_jenner Autocorrected from 'inevitable'.
929703408449343489 2017-11-12 13:32:20 UTC <iaink85> @mariacaulfield Percentage of people's lapels completely visible: 33%. Drawing conclusions based on incomplete data is a rather bad habit for an MP.
929654137645621248 2017-11-12 10:16:33 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson A night? Fair play to the guy. I'd think it was more like the 'British porn' from Family Guy.

928359708829810689 2017-11-08 20:32:57 UTC <iaink85> @KLM Got woken up en route to Tokyo last December to be confronted by cabin staff with a birthday cake. Was a really nice surprise and is just one reason that I'll always fly with KLM when I can - sometimes even if it involves a change.
928356886075895808 2017-11-08 20:21:44 UTC <iaink85> @Sathnam May so weak that he reckons he can just ride it out. Seems not to realise the gravity of his actions (and not to care).
928328467317493760 2017-11-08 18:28:48 UTC <iaink85> @andy_murray @BBCNews @BBCScotlandNews @13rew Knew I'd find this here somewhere!
928327851711049728 2017-11-08 18:26:22 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Seems legit. One should always refer to one's female friends as 'Sugar Tits' - it's the key to lasting and rewarding friendships and definitely doesn't indicate that one is a prick.

927671682826997760 2017-11-06 22:58:59 UTC <iaink85> @AllieHBNews @BBCNews @maxtweenie Lol? The production company paid the actors (or their companies). The BBC just paid the production company for the programme.

927242161636114432 2017-11-05 18:32:13 UTC <iaink85> @SWAIM_CORP Genuine question. If they took him on shinkansen to, say, Kyushu and left him there, how long until he could find his way back to US?

927236288478097408 2017-11-05 18:08:53 UTC <iaink85> @RealDMitchell Because no matter how much someone might want to make a particular joke, if things don't line up then they should just let it go.
926876971736412161 2017-11-04 18:21:05 UTC <iaink85> @BBCSport Assume this is a way fr the BBC to collate all of the laughing gifs available in one place.

925407497145503745 2017-10-31 17:01:55 UTC <iaink85> @standupmaths Not sure I could take the vaguely condescending tone every day for the next five months - the word 'geek' appeared inside 20 words...
925404938955608065 2017-10-31 16:51:45 UTC <iaink85> @daraobriain @MrEdByrne Surely you're higher in the pecking order? I mean, if one hasn't been in Father Ted, is one even an Irish comedian?

925089129158856704 2017-10-30 19:56:50 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump DO SOMETHING!!
925058251938586625 2017-10-30 17:54:08 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob It's only a matter of time before Trump is turfed out, and the world can be afraid of Mike Pence instead.
924949879633346560 2017-10-30 10:43:30 UTC <iaink85> @daraobriain Nice! Is there a specially derived sign for your idiosyncratic 'err...'? :-D

But given that older generation generally voted Leave, can't see different outcome.

924323137625427970 2017-10-28 17:13:03 UTC <iaink85> @michaelgove Neither you nor Kinnock should be anywhere near public debate based on that exchange.
924321154055200768 2017-10-28 17:05:10 UTC <iaink85> @michaelgove How soon after your brain parsed 'I'll try to make an edgy joke about Weinstein' did you remember you're an MP and he's essentially evil?

923952658603565061 2017-10-27 16:40:54 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Or wait for trial/results of investigation? Would you believe a murder suspect, or keep them on remand?
923952211616501762 2017-10-27 16:39:08 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Say sum1 accused of fraud came on Twitter and said 'after months of investigation, it's been shown I'm innocent', would you believe them?

921875076944887808 2017-10-21 23:05:20 UTC <iaink85> @ASlavitt @SenGillibrand Genuine question: why only vulnerable children? Why does the US not take the view that children in general should get coverage regardless?
921855191632285696 2017-10-21 21:46:19 UTC <iaink85> @ramzpaul In your scenario, maybe try a non-sexual advance initially mate. Move on to the further stages after acknowledging her as a person.

921709799758286848 2017-10-21 12:08:35 UTC <iaink85> @MarieAnnUK @iam_DRS Remember that in this example, they'd also cut your hours after the fall out (economy worth less) so you'd have less money in real terms.
921673899871481856 2017-10-21 09:45:56 UTC <iaink85> @ASlavitt Lack of a comma implies you perceive Ryan as human. Bold take at the moment.

921281543838031872 2017-10-20 07:46:51 UTC <iaink85> We need a much more competent set of leaders than we have if we're to remotely avoid any of this.https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/921068161692205057
921093063929364492 2017-10-19 19:17:54 UTC <iaink85> @RealDMitchell Just managed to watch the finale and now get this. If there isn't, I'll lose my shit. Also, you play deranged superbly. Are you method?
920950233999249408 2017-10-19 09:50:20 UTC <iaink85> @CNBC A problem up there with quantum computing, protein folding, getting to Mars, and solving the Riemann Hypothesis, I guess.
920947093212139520 2017-10-19 09:37:52 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob Gotta hope that was supposed to be 'condemn'.
920929550627934208 2017-10-19 08:28:09 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob Folding one's arms in a suit always feels super weird...fair play for sticking with it, the lying smeghead.
920775894322634754 2017-10-18 22:17:35 UTC <iaink85> @Nicole_Cliffe @thesusan @daisy_razor This explains how my wife is able to put on shoes, coat and repack multiple handbags in an eye blink...turns out it's my time that's dilated
920774528493588480 2017-10-18 22:12:09 UTC <iaink85> @Nicole_Cliffe @maropetro @tmslft @tabatkins Sorry to break it to you, but one's first ridiculously loud sneeze is the indication that the devil has, in fact, irreversibly gotten in.
920713871702265856 2017-10-18 18:11:07 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @bbclaurak What's your audience now? Depressing that you prefaced your tweet like that.
920704684561715200 2017-10-18 17:34:37 UTC <iaink85> @DavidBedwell Yup. Also belies a desire to shift attention away from suffering women. Same as the 'not all men' -type responses.
920656083949146112 2017-10-18 14:21:30 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Unedited 'proof'?
920611728211304450 2017-10-18 11:25:14 UTC <iaink85> @CrystalMazeHQ @LauraBrandist It's not actually that great....  Ha! Psych....it's f*@king incredible. #startthefans
920295748570411008 2017-10-17 14:29:39 UTC <iaink85> @daraobriain At least #MockTheWeek are often considerate enough to give you that jaunty yellow cap.
920109814553948160 2017-10-16 02:10:49 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson It's The Hangover guys but from a parallel, evil dimension.
920069110452678656 2017-10-16 23:29:04 UTC <iaink85> @eelarson @ZTracer @sangerkatz So if a provider could prove a recently manifest condition was likely present since birth, coverage would be invalid? That's appalling.
920064482503806976 2017-10-16 23:10:41 UTC <iaink85> @SadiqKhan @LondonFire @daddymchill May be easier for girls to aspire to the profession if they're not being quietly dissuaded by the use of 'fireman' though.

920021060019523587 2017-10-16 20:18:08 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson That's a 'joke'? *reaches for dictionary*...*throws dictionary at laptop because Twitter is depressing*
920020301152509958 2017-10-16 20:15:07 UTC <iaink85> @KatCapps @LisPower1 @CHARHARTMAN @AmeliaFitzrovia @90percenters I reckon Boris could give that a decent crack.
919996458832625669 2017-10-16 18:40:23 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob @josephmdurso @jon_warburton Because of Brexit we can only afford a TIE fighter.
919995852038508544 2017-10-16 18:37:58 UTC <iaink85> @josephmdurso It was a dank, red day in October and the clock was striking fifteen...

919206191506624513 2017-10-14 14:20:08 UTC <iaink85> @DMReporter Presumably a man was involved as well? Unless I'm missing something.
919203020168138757 2017-10-14 14:07:32 UTC <iaink85> I'd also be interested in knowing the response to this, @Jeremy_Hunt . Is your decision- making affected by this?https://twitter.com/Rachael_Swindon/status/918720597357711361
919142449162932225 2017-10-14 10:06:51 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump : 'the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes'. Possibly describing himself & world's response.

918410673973026816 2017-10-12 09:39:02 UTC <iaink85> @charliekirk11 What if there were only 'Scouts' and boys & girls socialised together more from a young age? Men might understand & respect women better...
918237754668060673 2017-10-11 22:11:55 UTC <iaink85> @charliekirk11 Come on mate, all I'm seeing today is people saying what an evil bastard Weinstein is. And it's not right-leaning people who are saying it.
918176560821227521 2017-10-11 18:08:45 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @daily_politics Zing!!
918160593084932096 2017-10-11 17:05:18 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump It's not like this is remotely the most important indicator of economic health though.
918159803381309440 2017-10-11 17:02:10 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Define 'virtually'. Dow @ 264days: GHW Bush +24%. Clin1 +11%. Clin2 +18% Obama1 +44% (crisis recovery). Obama2 +11%. Trump +15% #dataFTW
918148103634587648 2017-10-11 16:15:40 UTC <iaink85> In case we ever forget that being male is often a hell of a lot easier than being female.https://twitter.com/jenstatsky/status/917939028149731328
918147880833216512 2017-10-11 16:14:47 UTC <iaink85> @jenstatsky Hard to comprehend the sheer hatred. And it's horrible to remember that we're essentially complicit by forgetting that women go thru this.

918009338744262656 2017-10-11 07:04:16 UTC <iaink85> @mrjamesob @stefanstern @iainmartin1 Which is the ultra- remain attitude? Saying leavers were lied to, or implying the front bench believe their actions to be detrimental to UK?
917787572440616960 2017-10-10 16:23:03 UTC <iaink85> @ellardent I reckon that 3 million years from now (or 3 million and 29?), Red Dwarf will still be on Dave at 9pm on Thursdays.
917787069052841984 2017-10-10 16:21:03 UTC <iaink85> @SimonNRicketts Immeasurably funnier and more apt.

917786521276682240 2017-10-10 16:18:52 UTC <iaink85> @SimonNRicketts I'd assume that a direction/preposition and some state verb could also be used? E.g.: "Baroness Trumpington's been in the kitchen, I see."
917753446127763456 2017-10-10 14:07:27 UTC <iaink85> @markberman Do it Rex. I mean, it probably immeasurably demeans both offices, but still. DO IT.

917663376385413120 2017-10-10 08:09:32 UTC <iaink85> @shoodybaw @badassday Proximity also important. Maybe EU only 7% of world population, but they're extremely close.
917501303600840704 2017-10-09 21:25:31 UTC <iaink85> @DOB_INC @JH_Stinson Seems fair enough. Kidnap him and force him to do videos like Kim Jong Il would have.

917109584657043457 2017-10-08 19:28:58 UTC <iaink85> @johnredwood As an early-career researcher, I like that I have options to apply for posts at EU research institutions if I so choose.
917109252417826817 2017-10-08 19:27:39 UTC <iaink85> @johnredwood Young people presumably like the options provided by a right to freedom of movement. Will this be maintained?
916427263528357889 2017-10-06 22:17:40 UTC <iaink85> @NadineDorries Boris is doing a pretty good job of destroying himself on his own.
916424800888815618 2017-10-06 22:07:53 UTC <iaink85> @NickBoles Given that it seems other countries could be lining up to pick UK clean during our 'negotiations', we'd welcome someone, you know, strong.

916083322710831104 2017-10-05 23:30:58 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson @Lowenaffchen Presumably stuff doesn't fit in it on the first attempt and he has to turn things around twice first. #moodkiller
915980647134646272 2017-10-05 16:42:59 UTC <iaink85> @ian_a_jones It was $1.51 to the pound on 5/10/2015. Apart from the Brexit vote, is there anything else that contributed to this behaviour?
915728423825395714 2017-10-04 00:00:44 UTC <iaink85> @daraobriain Just tell one joke in a recursive manner, like some insane humour fractal.

915720061977075719 2017-10-04 23:27:30 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson Lol, we have single payer in the UK, and if anything, we're getting more and more right-wing, depressingly.
915678251275755520 2017-10-04 20:41:22 UTC <iaink85> @arobertwebb Well hey, what's a bit darker after that burning picture that creeped me the fuck out?

912062380640817152 2017-09-24 21:13:11 UTC <iaink85> @KrangTNelson I guess you think you tweeted this just after it happened. Given the delay in the story, how long have you really been sat with your phone?

911215999709597696 2017-09-22 13:09:58 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @Simstersnose True story. That's what i was getting at, unfortunately.
911179391887138816 2017-09-22 10:44:30 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews It'd only be a matter of time before one 'felt scared' and ended up shooting a BAME person for not showing their hands fast enough. No guns.

910255742829113344 2017-09-19 21:34:15 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump You say these things so easily. Does the idea of being responsible for the deaths of innocents affect you? Do you think abt it? You should.

909359139574501377 2017-09-17 10:11:28 UTC <iaink85> @spellar I asked you a genuine question. How do we avoid it? If other countries do, how do they get around it? Resent being patronised by my MP.
909327157062664193 2017-09-17 08:04:23 UTC <iaink85> @spellar The Sun is good at being rather vague while making people angry. No detail/explanation. If they're regulations, how do bureaucrats avoid?

909117524398297094 2017-09-16 18:11:23 UTC <iaink85> @DMReporter Given that inflation is at 3% and rising, these people (and us in general) can buy less and less with their millions.

909097967403126784 2017-09-16 16:53:40 UTC <iaink85> @PolakPolly @martyjsay Would that be relevant? Doing a specific set of tasks 40-hrs a week doesn't trump reading massively about the subject and analysing data.

909025769598410752 2017-09-16 12:06:47 UTC <iaink85> @ProgMagazineUK Not a single mention of any winners though?! Oh well - too much to hope for I guess.
908995504717156352 2017-09-16 10:06:31 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @JLG_1882 Well, yeah...? Not enough characters to suggest they also continue to accept my passport/DL.
908955180456202240 2017-09-16 07:26:17 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Make the ID free and easily accessible, and maybe I agree. Disenfranchising people who can't afford passport or DL is also not good.

908662558059585537 2017-09-15 12:03:30 UTC <iaink85> @PrisonPlanet @WendyHolland2 Depends what you're protesting. If you want more police funding, then get out and say so, but if you're protesting immigration, we'll argue.
908660419048419328 2017-09-15 11:55:00 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Either you're speculating or privy to info that hasn't been released publicly in UK for good reason. Be sensible & don't hinder search.

908052056237395969 2017-09-13 19:37:35 UTC <iaink85> @spellar @P_Madeley_Star Does this mean that for 1 out of every 3 votes he'll back the remain side? Or could he not just look at the situation objectively?

907864158741430277 2017-09-13 07:10:57 UTC <iaink85> @CommonsSTC @KingTekkers @DlanodTmurp Plenty of girls in Chemical Engineering (though still not parity) who enjoy it and my PhD advisor was a woman - the world needs that.

907609222711578630 2017-09-12 14:17:55 UTC <iaink85> @CommonsSTC @KingTekkers @DlanodTmurp I hope we can change that by directing STEM subjects much more towards girls at a young age.
907608889587388418 2017-09-12 14:16:36 UTC <iaink85> @CommonsSTC @KingTekkers Given that from what I can tell only 2 have a STEM degree, we clearly have very strange criteria, even before we talk equality.

903728259401166849 2017-09-01 21:16:22 UTC <iaink85> @ShaunKing @poorlybehaved Thanks - that's what I assumed, but didn't know the exact offence she'd have been forced to commit if she acquiesced.
903727821838745600 2017-09-01 21:14:37 UTC <iaink85> @70Ceeks Even if he does, he says he's worth $10bn. It's like me donating $2.
903638090597715968 2017-09-01 15:18:04 UTC <iaink85> @ShaunKing @caffeinatedcree @Cholie43 Might be wrong, but get the impression the cop was more interested in him being the big guy in control than getting usable evidence.
903637733150773250 2017-09-01 15:16:39 UTC <iaink85> @bethhh_k For Buzzfeed? I've got *some* standards. #notreally #iwishiwrotethat

903612743676289024 2017-09-01 13:37:21 UTC <iaink85> @ShaunKing Presumably without a warrant, sticking a needle in a patient would also constitute assault?
903546427036622849 2017-09-01 09:13:49 UTC <iaink85> @NHKWORLD_News That's literally a thousandth of the word he uses to describe himself (billionaire). It's like me donating $10.

902939036221935616 2017-08-30 17:00:16 UTC <iaink85> @AbeShinzo @number10gov Don't ruin our relations with the Japanese - I like it there. Remember to say thank you at your press conferences! ("watashi wa baka desu")
902929761147736065 2017-08-30 16:23:25 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump It's probably already the case, but please remember that things that you do or say can result in people dying. Have some fucking sense.
902210442881323008 2017-08-28 16:45:06 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @JonnMcC Was thinking about that as well.
902198491459592193 2017-08-28 15:57:37 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner It's the 'so-called' that's depressing. Henceforth he is a 'so-called businessman'.
902195994439319552 2017-08-28 15:47:41 UTC <iaink85> @katystoll Could be prefixed with 'as a consequence of current education, society and culture...'. Change some things and that might not be true.
902128447132246016 2017-08-28 11:19:17 UTC <iaink85> @JennyPentland @ChrisCJackson @random_canuk "Nobody in their right mind". If people feel that way, there's no reasoning with such an appalling mentality.
902119074058174464 2017-08-28 10:42:02 UTC <iaink85> @virginmedia @RichardAyoade They do not hold the internet, and no one man should be able to attain it.
901961192989761536 2017-08-27 00:14:40 UTC <iaink85> @JennyPentland @ChrisCJackson @random_canuk Yeah assumed that's what you meant. 1) those statistics aren't comparable & 2) nobody in their right mind wants ppl to die & you know that.

901904278629085184 2017-08-27 20:28:31 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Maybe you could just lay off the partisan politics for 24hrs? You know, with the people dying due to the natural disaster and all?
901902901093818368 2017-08-27 20:23:02 UTC <iaink85> @drmistercody Something seems incongruous here.pic.twitter.com/5HDxjM6w3j
901898635838971904 2017-08-27 20:06:05 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Presumably laying groundwork so you can say you were responding to something unprecedented when you inevitably fuck up?

901892197796245504 2017-08-27 19:40:30 UTC <iaink85> @Nigel_Farage Presumably you'd see someone (potentially an innocent bystander) dying after being Tased (due to med condition) as a small price to pay?

900834374316417027 2017-08-24 21:37:06 UTC <iaink85> @joelycett Almost feels like progress that someone will look at someone getting their PhD and say "huh, compensating for something?"
900673906385854464 2017-08-24 10:59:27 UTC <iaink85> @neiltyson @ColinGWest Eclipse enjoyability factor = sqrt(1-A^2) where A is the % of totality. Thus, 90% of totality would be 44% the enjoyment of a total eclipse.
900672340203327488 2017-08-24 10:53:14 UTC <iaink85> @neiltyson If one were to define rarity by surface coverage (of Earth) rather than frequency, would that be more agreeable? Seems a little facetious.
900416896041930753 2017-08-23 17:58:11 UTC <iaink85> @jonlovett His narcissism makes it weird that he's so hateful. Fund single-payer HC & 200m people love him. Tackle climate change & world loves him.

889828400222924801 2017-07-25 12:43:17 UTC <iaink85> @ian_a_jones Are all of the seats different? Absolutely don't dispute the survey, just interested to see if similar seats get similar grades.

888985130605391872 2017-07-22 04:52:26 UTC <iaink85> @TellMamaUK Given that most tweets are either links to MSM news stories or replies to people who tweet directly, it's hard to see what this even means.
888979326384918529 2017-07-22 04:29:22 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @SunApology "Ok Jackson, you've had 3 days, where's my Lineker dirt?"  "Erm, he went to a Starbucks...?"  "God damn it Jackson....."
888977571152580609 2017-07-22 04:22:24 UTC <iaink85> @SunApology @MikeShaunGlover That, and ppl like to get out of the hotel anyway. Ridiculous.

888973769326424065 2017-07-22 04:07:17 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner He should've said 'full disclosure'. 'Full transparency' would be leaving them where they are.
888755080954081281 2017-07-22 13:38:18 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Here is a thing, but don't think about the thing when there is this other (less bad) thing. FAKE NEWS! #moron

887712587978346498 2017-07-19 16:35:48 UTC <iaink85> @bengoldacre @TKMarx Think the original tweet assumes a necessity to switch careers in some cases.
887174058797936640 2017-07-17 04:55:53 UTC <iaink85> @JimMFelton I like how you can see the moment the other parties stare at David Davis and just think 'what the fuck are you playing at?'

883087926766260233 2017-07-06 22:19:03 UTC <iaink85> @MaraWilson Presumably it asked for a more respectful tone before responding?

882739583301058560 2017-07-05 23:14:51 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @2dAmMuslim Presumably the more he looks like he supports Trump, the more he offsets a possible extradition to the US if he ever leaves the embassy?
882731009736921089 2017-07-05 22:40:47 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @LOLGOP Presumably a significant proportion of those 2 groups are the same people.

877462780785418241 2017-06-21 09:46:44 UTC <iaink85> @MetroUK @MICHAEL13056654 Well....yes, clearly, but I don't think it's an offence punishable by custody.
877446495288602628 2017-06-21 08:42:01 UTC <iaink85> @MetroUK @MICHAEL13056654 Being able to vote in either of 2 locations is not the same as being able to vote twice. Any person that did committed a criminal offence.

876748262346305536 2017-06-19 10:27:29 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @ChrisMasonBBC He's got confused between 'deep and special' and 'strong and stable'. Understandable, as both are bullwallop. #brexittalks
876721025152667648 2017-06-19 08:39:15 UTC <iaink85> @BBCBreakfast @BBCNormanS @Deadloud Presumably he'll be charged with murder and multiple counts of attempted murder. The cited offence was correct at time of arrest.

874935283388743682 2017-06-14 10:23:21 UTC <iaink85> @ian_a_jones Includes zero hours? Wonder if it's possible to come up with a metric based on work output rather than ppl marked as employed?
874305268502458369 2017-06-12 16:39:54 UTC <iaink85> @bbclaurak After basing their entire campaign around a May vs Corbyn narrative, they know she can't leave and not have to call another GE.
874300540263555072 2017-06-12 16:21:07 UTC <iaink85> @OwenJones84 If the Tories would fund secondary education, young people would have more of the tools necessary to assess affordability.

871515563293638656 2017-06-04 23:54:36 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump You simultaneously offer us support, but use our tragedy for your own ends. Do you think we don't have Twitter? Why do you disrespect us so?
871514903433142277 2017-06-04 23:51:59 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump @Peter_W_Ostman Wielded by trained firearms officers, whilst the perpetrators didn't have any?
871508810787168256 2017-06-04 23:27:46 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Any chance you could rescind your  $110billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia?
871508303167328256 2017-06-04 23:25:45 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump Not sure we've got the time to wait for you to 'get smart', mate. #missionimpossible
871298566245015553 2017-06-04 09:32:20 UTC <iaink85> @metpoliceuk @amielucha Republican-authored report in US showed that this almost never happens.

870940608826941440 2017-06-03 09:49:57 UTC <iaink85> @BeardedGenius @Zar_RedIssue @AdamMcKola @Sunth There's a spreadsheet somewhere listing how many times each candidate has said 'Strong and Stable'. Person at the bottom Jun 9th gets shot.
870937820654952448 2017-06-03 09:38:52 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @stephencooke4 You got a better experience than those of us who did.
870936310978097152 2017-06-03 09:32:52 UTC <iaink85> @LeaveEUOfficial I'm sure the Welsh (weird of you to forget them, given that they voted Leave) would be surprised to hear that. Cymraeg not considered?
870575329244565505 2017-06-02 09:38:27 UTC <iaink85> @bengoldacre Cut education, cut critical thinking, cut ability of the populace to understand the world, increase fear, increase reliance, increase power.
870433416482828289 2017-06-01 00:14:33 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner If Trump was enclosed in a box, you wouldn't know if he was fucking things up until he was observed.  jk - he's always fucking things up.

870053452180795392 2017-05-31 23:04:42 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Or super depressing....
870050448627159040 2017-05-31 22:52:46 UTC <iaink85> @brhodes But they rely on freemarket captialism. As long as we make sure that renewables completely usurp fossil on cost, climate action will endure.
870048654714966016 2017-05-31 22:45:38 UTC <iaink85> @alanabottsford I imagine that this would still have been valid after 30mins. God bless the internet - full of pricks but often the right kind of pricks.
869706543255695361 2017-05-30 00:06:12 UTC <iaink85> @BBCRadio4 @jeremycorbyn @BBCNews Maybot could probably have recalled it, unless she managed to get caught in a "strong and stable" loop again.
869703364027797505 2017-05-30 23:53:34 UTC <iaink85> @ProfBrianCox I keep reading 'no deal is better than a bad deal' as if a bad deal is what they're after. Like 'no biscuits are better than hobnobs'.
869701439131725825 2017-05-30 23:45:56 UTC <iaink85> @theresa_may What's the plan? And don't point us to that white paper - it's hogwash.
868888404947329025 2017-05-28 17:55:13 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump 1 of your favourite phrases in speeches & interviews is 'some people are saying....'. I imagine similar logic works there - never happened.
868105375505149953 2017-05-26 14:03:44 UTC <iaink85> @piersmorgan You don't think she's also traumatised? Easy to second guess actions of someone who must be at emotional nadir when you have no empathy.
867713137633632258 2017-05-25 12:05:07 UTC <iaink85> @SenSanders In a parallel universe, this guy is currently President of the US and the world is a slightly nicer place.
867339155323408385 2017-05-24 11:19:03 UTC <iaink85> @allisonpearson Suspension of habeus corpus makes our society safer? I'd say that it makes our society unrecognisable.

865212489218355200 2017-05-18 14:28:26 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump All Republicans inexorably coming to conclusion that: "He's not the messiah, he's a very naughty boy".

862819449598038016 2017-05-11 23:59:21 UTC <iaink85> @BBCHelenaLee @BBCNews Not drawing conclusions abt stories they push (tho they've announced most +ve labour policies recently). Just saying they tweet front pages.
862817904429072384 2017-05-11 23:53:13 UTC <iaink85> @BBCHelenaLee @BBCNews They tweet every front page. Every evening.
862781200615735296 2017-05-11 21:27:22 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew @SILEeeles Maybe 'too much' on occasion because demand fluctuates. If demand drops, need to reduce supply to keep grid frequency at 50Hz.

862365003785129985 2017-05-10 17:53:33 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump @BBCNews @BBCWorld Has he ever given a response to a question using a sentence that couldn't be understood by the average 7-year-old?
860545691361456128 2017-05-05 17:24:15 UTC <iaink85> @marcusbrig It's not people's fault (sometimes) if they don't understand things, but all political decisions affect them just the same. Change to PR.
860459116665466881 2017-05-05 11:40:14 UTC <iaink85> @bengoldacre Best of 21 rock-paper-scissors. See which candidate is most observant/analytical
860101538307551232 2017-05-04 11:59:21 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @MsPackyetti Given policies re: funding of abortion services, does this mean victims of sexual assault could end up with having to find $17000 as well?
859808873242390529 2017-05-03 16:36:24 UTC <iaink85> @StephenMangan Sounds like the Orange guy across the pond.
859787970118914052 2017-05-03 15:13:20 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Maybe true - but if a policy is only to describe it as such after authorities do, then the problem lies there. Like I said, I don't know.
859784264967233536 2017-05-03 14:58:37 UTC <iaink85> @bbclaurak @theresa_may @BBCBreaking @WarmongerHodges @Kevinpo86545910 For clarity, who's conducting the sexual assault in this scenario?
859783318077886465 2017-05-03 14:54:51 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Genuine question: do media outlets use 'terrorist' once it's been described as such by police? One implies police bias, the other media bias
859782773904732160 2017-05-03 14:52:41 UTC <iaink85> @AdamBienkov @notlistenning1 Meh - if they launched with something positive about their own policies rather than an attack ad, this opportunity wouldn't have arisen.

857987426832310272 2017-04-28 15:58:37 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @BBC_HaveYourSay @phil_bar Need an induction first.
857843720196063232 2017-04-27 06:27:35 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump if you're remotely thinking you may have to use nuclear weapons, please go to visit Hiroshima/Nagasaki 1st. It's important.
857232369899769856 2017-04-26 13:58:18 UTC <iaink85> @BBCRealityCheck Wonder if it's useful to measure this in 'hours of work' (as per contract) rather than the number/rate of people working.
857230587203080193 2017-04-26 13:51:13 UTC <iaink85> @Conservatives @BBCNews Not really. Future of NHS funding depends on us funding the NHS. The money is findable if they want to find it.

857164051679498242 2017-04-26 09:26:49 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Dislike. Played at party w/ 12ppl. Instantly knew my wife was werewolf. Rest of townspeople lynched me. Wife massacred everyone. Bloodbath.
856861680994856963 2017-04-25 13:25:19 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Seems that within 3 clicks of something you RT, I'm reading stuff from the worst people in the country. An almost tangible degree of hate.
856861071935778820 2017-04-25 13:22:53 UTC <iaink85> @cymrurouge Every leader of every nuclear-armed state should go and see Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It should be the law. See what happened. Read. Think.
856661355335745537 2017-04-24 00:09:17 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Just as well. What if such a person were female and he was left alone with her? He'd be unable to speak.

855890288191078400 2017-04-22 21:05:21 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump My hypocrisy meter and irony meter have both just exploded. Read climate science literature and drill some sense into your administration.
855532489049350150 2017-04-21 21:23:35 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Someone just needs to tell him to make the comments first, and finish with the question...

854475951413002241 2017-04-18 23:25:16 UTC <iaink85> @hendopolis @BBCNews Did they mean to make her look positively unhinged? She may as well be monologuing to 007 whilst holding a cat.
854377459789295616 2017-04-18 16:53:54 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @Shelleymillwar2 I'd say the options are depressing rather than the election itself. Compared to some countries, we're lucky to be able to choose.

847392091520905216 2017-03-30 10:16:33 UTC <iaink85> @DigitalSneeze @onceablue76 thought tis was by definition a time for de-unification?
847158207185403905 2017-03-29 18:47:10 UTC <iaink85> @LouiseMensch always loved that analogy. Average lifespan of butterfly = 1 month.
847129894454792192 2017-03-29 16:54:40 UTC <iaink85> @marcusbrig they were completely baked after Article 47. Wait til you get to Article 84 - it's a doozy.
847128254054064132 2017-03-29 16:48:09 UTC <iaink85> @BorisJohnson 'deep and special' won't catch on, Boris - it's creepy.
847127658966212608 2017-03-29 16:45:47 UTC <iaink85> @alaindebotton pssst! Theresa! You wrote 'deep and special partnership' a few too many times. #unimaginative #theyrejustnothtatintous
847126531184975875 2017-03-29 16:41:18 UTC <iaink85> @marcusbrig @faisalislam more concerned about 'deep & special partnership' being repeated 7 times. Just sounds creepy. Who thought of that?
846920419206746114 2017-03-28 03:02:17 UTC <iaink85> @hendopolis @BBCNews @karlako23 they're quoting the headline. Like they do for all the front pages. Every day.
846442910061088769 2017-03-27 19:24:50 UTC <iaink85> suggest you start w/ PGP, then go from there....The Code Book by @SLSingh can give basic grasp of the maths and is superb.
845948034647252999 2017-03-26 10:38:23 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @mattround The Poseidon Adventure!! GENE HACKMAN PLAYS A PRIEST IN IT! #tookittoofar #justwatchedit #UHTisshite
845589611938283520 2017-03-25 10:54:08 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner looks like someone who ate 8 bowls of chilli and has spent the last 90mins in the bathroom.
845208077590777858 2017-03-24 09:38:03 UTC <iaink85> @Jezebel "A lot of information may be learned..." depends on how you rate his capacity for learning. I nominate that for redaction as well.
845184845483409408 2017-03-24 08:05:44 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump @RonaldKlain #futuretrolled by his ghostwriter. Buy that guy a beer.
844981730637484034 2017-03-23 18:38:38 UTC <iaink85> @Mediaite thought free will was a thing to these people. Don't women get to exercise free will regarding intention to have a child?
844922816252272640 2017-03-23 14:44:31 UTC <iaink85> @markke11y any chance of a go-pro recording your playing for a few songs? Finding it hard to learn some of the recent ones!
844844407027187713 2017-03-23 09:32:57 UTC <iaink85> @KTHopkins @FoxNews @ColBannister @NatalieHatchet2 @huge2ya and in the context that he knows these things can happen so vigilance necessary.
844296362900553729 2017-03-21 21:15:13 UTC <iaink85> @GaryLineker it's confirmation bias, chief. Left media sees 'too much' coverage of Farage. Right - opposition to Brexit. Reality: centre-ish
844243669406441472 2017-03-21 17:45:50 UTC <iaink85> @whatifnumbers @elipongo coincidence? For anyone else, I'd say yes. But Randall...? Not a chance.
844234396995674112 2017-03-21 17:09:00 UTC <iaink85> @whatifnumbers 1000: Number of days between the last post and this one.
843924953506500608 2017-03-20 20:39:22 UTC <iaink85> @RoyalJordanian @ReedusCanadafan does the 'combined flight' thing imply transit via US?
843897628635086848 2017-03-20 18:50:48 UTC <iaink85> @seanspicer @BBCJonSopel I'm gonna go with 'unconvincingly', just like every other briefing.
843896921618071554 2017-03-20 18:47:59 UTC <iaink85> @StephenMangan he taught me that there's no market for UHT milk because it's shite.
843425816289726464 2017-03-19 11:35:59 UTC <iaink85> @guardian @RealDMitchell audience votes turned out fine for Boaty McBoatface.
842860649726300160 2017-03-17 22:10:13 UTC <iaink85> @SpeakerRyan what does it feel like to (even though you may feel it makes economic sense) introduce a bill that you know will kill people?
842854648008597505 2017-03-17 21:46:22 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff @mirzam_nimu @shna23 imposter syndrome can be a tough thing to deal with.
842853397187477507 2017-03-17 21:41:24 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff @Fayettetopia @BelieveinGod321 if one wore a tinfoil hat, would the ear bug signals rattle permanently around one's brain?
842524249927630848 2017-03-16 23:53:29 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @richardosman prob for the best. Last time some1 as tall as u went through immigration, he was retrieving a galaxy in Men In Black.
842420752821415936 2017-03-16 17:02:13 UTC <iaink85> @alanferrier what's he actually been doing since July?
842414488481628160 2017-03-16 16:37:20 UTC <iaink85> @Brendanekstrom @KagroX @mindywhite he bought that from a great guy on a bridge in Paris.
842414157102223360 2017-03-16 16:36:01 UTC <iaink85> @KagroX .....has he eaten them?
842097554212954114 2017-03-15 19:37:56 UTC <iaink85> @georgeeaton @lensgrdr Yeah, I know - meant it's possible to be strong on both. Strong on tax hike, automatically strong on PMQs.
842048142493265920 2017-03-15 16:21:36 UTC <iaink85> @georgeeaton @lensgrdr but in asking difficult Qs about tax hikes and u-turns, he would hold gvt to account, while also looking good in PMQs
842045722887360513 2017-03-15 16:11:59 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff just mean that if they hadn't have waited, WH wouldn't've had opportunity to pre-empt (to make leak by WH less suspected?)
842045172045213696 2017-03-15 16:09:48 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff if MSNBC'd broken into programmes to cover them, would've been different though? Why WH pre-empt if leaked? Steal thunder?
841927310253146112 2017-03-15 08:21:27 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews this is our own antisemitism. Deflecting it on to Trump ignores UK-grown racism. Trump may embolden, but we need to deal.
841799541519208448 2017-03-14 23:53:45 UTC <iaink85> @maddow recent financial years? Or like, the 90s or something?
841797550306922498 2017-03-14 23:45:50 UTC <iaink85> @WhiteHouse @VP @DianeGa20261501 godly='republican'? Obama once spontaneously sang Amazing Grace in church. Pretty Christian thing to do.
840891626104979456 2017-03-12 11:46:01 UTC <iaink85> @Tim_O_Brien @ProfBrianCox may genuinely provide a single (used) envelope to my engineering UGs rather than answer booklet. Panic ensues.
839675983376580608 2017-03-08 03:15:29 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews Presumably an interesting follow-up to Revolving Doors @PrivateEyeNews
839541962814402560 2017-03-08 18:22:56 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner Given Brexit campaign twisting, presumably we could use as: "I'm also in favour of a second referendum....." - Farage, 2017
839230361297117185 2017-03-07 21:44:44 UTC <iaink85> @bbcthree a) that's awesome, b) she makes moves I can only dream of, and c) path to good things at the Olympics in Tokyo?
838857745268887553 2017-03-06 21:04:06 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff @DanaMStanley after the throw, more like Ryan. Sees the problem, does absolutely nothing to try to avoid it.
838541329156161536 2017-03-05 00:06:46 UTC <iaink85> @PressSec @PeteForsyth xkcd has something for everything.
837462481295507456 2017-03-02 00:39:49 UTC <iaink85> @timminchin congratulations! But then, I guess it's not that special; after all, if you didn't have her, you'd probably have somebody else
837383934866501632 2017-03-02 19:27:42 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff @nathenson 1. Ne5+? Kf6 2. Nxf7 Rf2 3. Kb1 Kxf7 4. Ka1 Rc1++
837378554874720256 2017-03-02 19:06:19 UTC <iaink85> @bengoldacre that line is super jagged as well. How'd the engine make the turns?
836638768660631554 2017-02-28 18:06:41 UTC <iaink85> @RoguePOTUSStaff - I gave BoD to that one partially as rep leaning could be split. 67% don't say trump though!
836637958472142850 2017-02-28 18:03:27 UTC <iaink85> @HotlineJosh @realDonaldTrump we can cherry-pick too. Q19, 66% don't consider you honest enough to say you're honest. 18% right temperament!
835859970981834752 2017-02-26 14:32:01 UTC <iaink85> @jeremycorbyn then vote against it and make them change their policy?
835745279030734848 2017-02-25 06:56:16 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @EversFam I don't think people are saying there weren't lots of people, just refuting 'biggest crowd' claim.
835738168385208320 2017-02-25 06:28:01 UTC <iaink85> @dennistaylor147 de facto legitimisation that will be seen around the world. It's fair game.
835735517757063170 2017-02-25 06:17:29 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump for a businessman, you don't seem to know much about economics. Have you heard of #impostersyndrome ?
835364636421566464 2017-02-24 05:43:44 UTC <iaink85> @BBCNews @BBCNorthAmerica i guess horrific policies are fine until he dreams one up that involves something about which you care.

835218453732687873 2017-02-24 20:02:51 UTC <iaink85> @Glinner @thedailybeast one assumes that will be challenged in courts?
834889787878305792 2017-02-23 22:16:51 UTC <iaink85> @JuliaHB1 given that they're net contributors, 'burden' only results 'cause commensurate rises in PS spending doesn't occur.
834067929662648321 2017-02-21 15:51:05 UTC <iaink85> @Nigel_Farage did you mean 'anyone who says there isn't a problem has different data (or interpretation thereof) and we should discuss.'?

831797002405048321 2017-02-15 09:27:14 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew Lol.
831639907768610817 2017-02-14 23:02:59 UTC <iaink85> @MsHelicat @BBCNews Express pushing property buying. Sure that's nothing to do with parent company having large property portfolios.
831571777964896259 2017-02-14 18:32:16 UTC <iaink85> @UKIP @BBCNews "wrong" = "a lie"?
831437896636841984 2017-02-14 09:40:16 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew @boggybrn multiplying still doesn't get the figures the mail quotes though.
831437388127809536 2017-02-14 09:38:15 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew @boggybrn yeah, I stood corrected on that one it seems!
831431039222444033 2017-02-14 09:13:01 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew @ed_davies assuming batt tech brings it higher than current state by the time it matters to a lot of people.
831429695455522817 2017-02-14 09:07:41 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew @ed_davies fair enough. Misremembered something I read maybe. Scale up by factor of 10 to account for mileage change.
831304657804865539 2017-02-13 00:50:49 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew - kinda late tho, so I could be wrong. Clearly renewable sources preferable, just running the calc on the Fail's premise. (2/2)
831304271308193792 2017-02-13 00:49:17 UTC <iaink85> @bobbyllew - I calc single 3200MW nuc plant powers 26m e-cars (ave 15000 mile/year) & 90 mile/kWh in 60days operation (ideal). (1/2)

830899136589398024 2017-02-12 21:59:26 UTC <iaink85> @Telegraph @timclark59 @ThatRenf that's the whole point of representative polling. They take a representative cross-section of population.
830804615906078720 2017-02-12 15:43:50 UTC <iaink85> @JeremyClarkson that's disappointing. 1st time in US next week and have to go via JFK and return via Atlanta.
830189958258364416 2017-02-10 23:01:24 UTC <iaink85> @DabAggin !  maybe? (nan-te kotta! koitsu wa nan-tte?)
830049975946055680 2017-02-10 13:45:10 UTC <iaink85> @Telegraph @timclark59 It's YouGov data though.
830006166306562048 2017-02-10 10:51:05 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump - mate, I think you left caps lock on. There's a 'shift' key, you know - it'll mean you only capitalise the 1st letter.
829295580761489409 2017-02-08 11:47:28 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump GOP obstructed Obama SCOTUS nominee for 10 months to run out the clock, right? That probably really irked you.
828762615711199232 2017-02-06 00:29:39 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump - presumably people would be happy to accept that if you tell them about the 'accumulation of data' to which you refer.
826839169896951808 2017-02-01 17:06:34 UTC <iaink85> @jk_rowling - the offensive thing about that: it still singles out women. Yr books show men can be great sorcerers too! Burn them together!
822494504808775680 2017-01-20 17:22:25 UTC <iaink85> @POTUS44 @POTUS @BDBoopster @YourMindAches @bk_pitt so it is - apologies - should've said migrated. New account automatically followed tho.
822493379103780864 2017-01-20 17:17:57 UTC <iaink85> @POTUS44 @POTUS @BDBoopster @YourMindAches @bk_pitt content from @potus will migrate to @potus44 and at that point will be taken over by Trump's team.
812414180812697601 2016-12-23 21:46:49 UTC <iaink85> @guardiannews I was at the Hypocenter in Nagasaki just over aweek ago. Before making more comments, he should visit Nagasaki/Hiroshima too.
808609203606536192 2016-12-13 09:47:12 UTC <iaink85> @ProfBrianCox @sandywinder - tier 4 visa students are pretty damn controlled though...
791779993676345345 2016-10-27 23:13:55 UTC <iaink85> @steverothery @AMetalhead13 You defining 'new stuff' as stuff since 1989, or a little more recent?

768486470931849216 2016-08-24 16:33:47 UTC <iaink85> @StephenMangan not suitable when stickles are random.
768083960748441600 2016-08-23 13:54:21 UTC <iaink85> @ProfBrianCox -one of the stranger proofs by contradiction.
768078164404891648 2016-08-23 13:31:19 UTC <iaink85> @HeatherWheeler @DavidLammy @mellymoo666666 - The EU is kind of an opt-in club by definition though. The British Empire? Not so much.
765268321981886464 2016-08-15 19:26:00 UTC <iaink85> @GrannyMarried - if we're talking rationalisation, it's not much different to you is it? "We're not the problem, it's the Muslims".
765238586841063424 2016-08-15 17:27:51 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump @DusDavid @GrannyMarried - it's a demonstration/reenactment. The people are protesting.
765237319876087808 2016-08-15 17:22:49 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump that might also be true if you were intelligent or had a remotely sensible worldview. Hint: Stop saying horrific things.
763000405634715648 2016-08-09 13:14:07 UTC <iaink85> @GabbyLogan @AlexKJTimes - not sure an appeal to hypocrisy is mitigation. Genuine point, but rephrase as if it's not a follow-on excuse.

752890369692622848 2016-07-12 15:40:26 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump - given the number of mass shootings that occur in the US, will you have to postpone every speech between now and November?
743854295829864448 2016-06-17 17:14:18 UTC <iaink85> @charltonbrooker @heathervalerie come on mate, what's more important? Critically acclaimed show or a way to make us forget the EUref chaos?
742256102360948736 2016-06-13 07:23:39 UTC <iaink85> @realDonaldTrump you being smart would be nice. Maybe you could just, I don't know, read a credible history text? It'd enlighten you. #dunce
741999090674900992 2016-06-12 14:22:23 UTC <iaink85> @nassercricket Therefore reviewing if a bowler incorrectly called for nb might be unfair on batter? Prob not so in Hales case though (2/2)
741998874945019904 2016-06-12 14:21:32 UTC <iaink85> @nassercricket Re Hales - does calling a nb give batter chance to change shot? i.e. hears nb and decides to do something different? (1/2)
739533536294756352 2016-06-05 19:05:09 UTC <iaink85> Ramsay Bolton is playing in #SoccerAid2016 - this may be our only chance to strike him down!
736187026601562112 2016-05-27 13:27:19 UTC <iaink85> @SkyCricket "umpire call" always confuses Beefy. Can u explain that when he sees it hit stumps on DRS, it's a prediction? (subject to error)
735181229897752577 2016-05-24 18:50:38 UTC <iaink85> @mastodonmusic @MetalHammer @BillBailey sage of the six paths?
724895544825511937 2016-04-26 09:39:00 UTC <iaink85> @kenshaz @DaveHarryRivers That's a red herring and the authors of the BMJ paper warned that that data shouldn't be used in the way Hunt has.
