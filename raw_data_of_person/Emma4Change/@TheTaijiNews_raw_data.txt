970428687031058432 2018-03-04 22:40:03 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @DublinAirport @lisacanale1 Emma is the name of the storm system that caused all the blizzards here.
970389946732224512 2018-03-04 20:06:06 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @thehill Joking about Melania leaving him because of his affair with porn star Stormy Daniels in front of his youngest son  classy!
970359363142483968 2018-03-04 18:04:35 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @DublinAirport This is adorable! Please keep us updated on Emmas progress

970111804847284224 2018-03-03 01:40:52 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @Lhultin @dukeandboy Yep, the person who runs the country deserves everybodys support even if he sexually assaulted women, cheats on his wife with porn stars, dodged the draft during war time and is a racist who colluded with Russians to cheat his way to become president.
964915336842641408 2018-02-17 17:31:58 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @GuthrieGF They dont care. Trump can have all the affairs he wants with porn stars so long as he delivers on tax cuts for them.
963988378730430464 2018-02-14 04:08:34 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @YouTube @piersmorgan When are you going to wake up to the fact Trump & the Republican Party are owned by the NRA?
961974520947945472 2018-02-09 14:46:13 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @TheLastWord Anybody else find it curious that @realDonaldTrump, who normally loves to publicly attack women, has absolutely nothing to say about @OMAROSA or @StormyDaniels?

954755634917969920 2018-01-20 16:40:56 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @mitchellvii Trumps forbidding commercial jets from crashing while commanding the stock market to go up in between his 3 day golf weekends is undoubtedly his greatest accomplishment 
954624906699796480 2018-01-20 08:01:28 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @Arellanov74 After Stormy Daniels, Id say Trumps 3rd marriage is now in shutdown mode too 
954233316768559104 2018-01-18 06:05:26 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @MarkDice @Spirit76Rising @Ntcdsnhl1 Sort of like how you all collectively lost your minds over Obama wearing a tan suit. As an outsider from the UK, Trump succumbing to a porn stars blackmail is the more worrisome of the two. Trump is destroying our historic alliance & I suspect Putin has kompromat on him.
954152195129143296 2018-01-18 00:43:05 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @MarkDice @Spirit76Rising That came after she was paid by Trump $130,000 for her silence in 2016. She had already told her story in 2011 that Trump wasnt aware of. Also notice that she purposely didnt sign her real name (Stephanie Clifford) to that document, so it isnt legally binding.

970111804847284224 2018-03-03 01:40:52 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @Lhultin @dukeandboy Yep, the person who runs the country deserves everybodys support even if he sexually assaulted women, cheats on his wife with porn stars, dodged the draft during war time and is a racist who colluded with Russians to cheat his way to become president.
964915336842641408 2018-02-17 17:31:58 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @GuthrieGF They dont care. Trump can have all the affairs he wants with porn stars so long as he delivers on tax cuts for them.

954624906699796480 2018-01-20 08:01:28 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @Arellanov74 After Stormy Daniels, Id say Trumps 3rd marriage is now in shutdown mode too

As an outsider from the UK, Trump succumbing to a porn stars blackmail is the more worrisome of the two. Trump is destroying our historic alliance & I suspect Putin has kompromat on him.
954152195129143296 2018-01-18 00:43:05 UTC <TheTaijiNews> @MarkDice @Spirit76Rising That came after she was paid by Trump $130,000 for her silence in 2016. She had already told her story in 2011 that Trump wasnt aware of. Also notice that she purposely didnt sign her real name (Stephanie Clifford) to that document, so it isnt legally binding.
