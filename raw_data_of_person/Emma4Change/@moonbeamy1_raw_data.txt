920730160755703808 2017-10-18 19:15:51 UTC <moonbeamy1> @TheView I can no longer stomach watching this show with Meghan McCain.  She has such angry energy and seems to be ready to pounce on people

817990727758008321 2017-01-07 07:06:01 UTC <moonbeamy1> @TonyRobbins You should either be unbiased and say nothing or let both sides have a voice. Just very disappointed,
817990603979927552 2017-01-07 07:05:32 UTC <moonbeamy1> @tonyrobbin @TonyRobbin He also was bashing ppl who were protesting the election. We still have rights and peaceful protest is still our right.
817990460547305472 2017-01-07 07:04:57 UTC <moonbeamy1> @TonyRobbins I was a bit disappointed coming to Tony's San Jose event. He only showed up half the time and did not state this on website
