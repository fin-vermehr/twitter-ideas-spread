968969041594540033 2018-02-28 21:59:56 UTC <bweiss22> The @teamtrace newsletter today was incredible. Imagine that: a GOP president who advocates for law enforcement to "take guns first, go through due process later." You know who never said that? President Obama. And yet "they're coming to take your guns" was the NRA scare tactic.pic.twitter.com/CbR5LpkkAZ

966785161655476224 2018-02-22 21:21:59 UTC <bweiss22> When the NRA can't scare its base into thinking the sitting president is "coming to take" its guns, then fewer people buy guns. Why's that? Because the gun lobby thrives on fear.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/966783873270140929

964208948835438592 2018-02-15 18:45:02 UTC <bweiss22> So many politicians share their thoughts and prayers after a mass shooting and then turn around to advocate for dangerous bills that put more guns in the hands of dangerous people.   @GwenGraham is calling them out.https://twitter.com/GwenGraham/status/964191839220850689

And if you want to TAKE ACTION this evening, donate to @GiffordsCourage and support the hard work of @GabbyGiffords and @ShuttleCDRKelly:https://secure.actblue.com/donate/giffords-website?refcode=header-homepage
963917684802023424 2018-02-14 23:27:39 UTC <bweiss22> I know it doesn't feel like it today, but tremendous progress has been made. Countless lives have been saved. Dangerous gun lobby-backed bills have been blocked by brave and formidable advocates. Stronger laws have been passed in states that are willing to come to the table.
963916825565245441 2018-02-14 23:24:14 UTC <bweiss22> The gun violence prevention movement was formed after the horrible tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Millions of Americans found their voices as advocates for safer communities. Incredible organizations like @GiffordsCourage were started to fight the gun lobby.
963916235846111232 2018-02-14 23:21:53 UTC <bweiss22> And to everyone who is saying, "If change didn't happen after Sandy Hook, it will never happen," I have to beg you to look at the bigger picture.
963915645053173761 2018-02-14 23:19:33 UTC <bweiss22> What happened in #Parkland today is NOT inevitable and it is NOT normal. We cannot continue to watch footage of children running for their lives and feel helpless. There are common sense steps we can take right now to prevent gun violence in the US.
