970438272068521986 2018-03-04 23:18:08 UTC <robsmith286> True, but that assumes a 'next govt'. Xi Jingping, Trump - and now possibly May - have other ideas about democracy.

966071070284570630 2018-02-20 22:04:26 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing He believed he won the youth vote. He didn't, he borrowed the remain vote. Now reality is knocking on the door of @UKLabour. He needs to stand up, say he made a mistake, and rip into the tories on brexit. @jeremycorbyn would see his ratings climb exponentially. #StopBrexit #FBPE
966068142446469120 2018-02-20 21:52:48 UTC <robsmith286> @fascinatorfun Totally agree. Corbyn's whole image is based on integrity and being a 'man of the people'. If he fudges the Labour Brexit position, he may lose some core vote and won't gain remain vote.  @jeremycorbyn it's all or nothing in this game.  #StopBrexit #FBPE #ABTV #ToriesOut
966065405310709760 2018-02-20 21:41:55 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing Yep, there's definitely potential. If Corbyn really wants to be PM he needs to go all out anti-Brexit. Still hedging his bets and time is running out.
966063563080110081 2018-02-20 21:34:36 UTC <robsmith286> @ledredman Yep, I'm equally cynical. But if it's BS, his front bench will be as unable as the Tories to maintain a consistent message. Long time to go until local elections.
966062545248407552 2018-02-20 21:30:34 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing Yeah, he's got until local elections to adopt a genuine #StopBrexit Labour position. Too late after that.

966041560692547584 2018-02-20 20:07:10 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing I agree. But if he plays for hearts and votes (nice phrase) then #StopBrexit should win him over. Not a great argument but we takes what we can get :)

Ultimately, the EU has been good for British business.

961700589855039488 2018-02-08 20:37:42 UTC <robsmith286> My limited experience of top level negotiations: 1. Top people agree heads of terms 2. Those drafting contract operate on open/honest basis 3. Everyone aims for win:win  This idea that we can spring some kasparov-like chess move on EU at 11th hour is childish guff.  #StopBrexit

Either way, JC, like May, will soon  have to declare their true stance on Brexit. No SM/CU will cost Labour a significant volume of votes.
961333187250147328 2018-02-07 20:17:47 UTC <robsmith286> @jeremycorbyn @muschifuss998 @Femi_Sorry @tedtully @KevinEwert1 I think you'll find the local elections will be used to drive a message on Brexit. It's the only electoral option available.
961332821133545472 2018-02-07 20:16:19 UTC <robsmith286> @jeremycorbyn @muschifuss998 @Femi_Sorry @tedtully @KevinEwert1 Yep, good point. But certainly true of many of the remainers I see on Twitter.
961327949004857346 2018-02-07 19:56:58 UTC <robsmith286> @jeremycorbyn @muschifuss998 @Femi_Sorry @tedtully @KevinEwert1 Well, massive swings to Lib Dems in recent local elections does not jibe with that. But to be honest, the numbers are slightly irrelevant. Remainers will not support Labour while their position on Brexit is no different to that of the Tories.
961322147321995265 2018-02-07 19:33:55 UTC <robsmith286> @jeremycorbyn @muschifuss998 @Femi_Sorry @tedtully @KevinEwert1 Not a hypothesis. It's based on the analysis of the GE17 result, which was published a few weeks back (sorry, I don't have a link but it was in The Guardian). Assumption that the young backed JC is not borne out. Plus you can see remainer backlash on Twitter every day.
961317738374402054 2018-02-07 19:16:23 UTC <robsmith286> And barely anything from him and May in PMQs.

961059661238624256 2018-02-06 02:10:53 UTC <robsmith286> No, totally agree. I try to support tweets  against Trump as much as possible.

958645625301676032 2018-01-31 10:18:22 UTC <robsmith286> @Bbmorg That means a lot of budgets get slashed. Even the 2008 crash was only est at 1% loss of GDP.

958483745320947714 2018-01-30 23:35:07 UTC <robsmith286> I like Merkel, she has class - and even with her own difficulties she can still crack a funny joke.https://twitter.com/remain_central/status/958142115522981888
958480257291612161 2018-01-30 23:21:15 UTC <robsmith286> I think your spot on. @DorothyBruce14 tweeted earlier that 2008 crash Was est to ONLY (my emphasis) cost 1% GDP. Your numbers seem to align with an 8% loss via hard brexit (WTO rules).https://twitter.com/TommyGreen/status/958474401267224576
958477825790660608 2018-01-30 23:11:35 UTC <robsmith286> @Richard_Econ One would think the 2% loss would be a point of interest for the media to examine in more detail.  Come on @guardian (I wouldn't expect the other rags and BBC to report this).  No wonder UKGOV were at such pains to rubbish the report.
958476322162053121 2018-01-30 23:05:37 UTC <robsmith286> @DorothyBruce14 That is genuinely frightening. And probably explains why our secret friend in DEXEU took such a risk in leaking to buzzfeed.  She/he is a hero.
958475365483188224 2018-01-30 23:01:49 UTC <robsmith286> @lunaperla Good point. Alternatively, to cover our losses from leaving EU, we'd need trade deals like the one projected with US (est to provide 0.2% GDP) with 10 other countries of similar size.  Brexit finances are broken.  #StopBrexit #FBPE #WATON #ABTV #A50challenge #ToriesOut
958469943053443073 2018-01-30 22:40:16 UTC <robsmith286> According to the buzzfeed leak, the very best economic position we could expect, even with a soft Brexit, is a loss of 2% GDP.  I don't know the exact figures but I'm guessing that 2% GDP loss is more costly to the UK than paying for EU membership?  #StopBrexit #FBPE #WATON
958465925237395456 2018-01-30 22:24:18 UTC <robsmith286> Superb article, with scary quote from Paul Krugman:  "Two percent is a lot!

958121621998456832 2018-01-29 23:36:10 UTC <robsmith286> I agree, but with a conciliatory note. There are millions of leave voters out there who were just outright conned. They thought they were voting for a better health service, an end to austerity etc.  The racist & wealth-driven brexiters can go feck themselves, however.https://twitter.com/BrexitBin/status/957775041097289729
958117267363024899 2018-01-29 23:18:52 UTC <robsmith286> But - if I read this right - the figures quoted assume a deal with the US.  A deal with the US involves lowering our regulatory standards (chlorinated chicken anyone?) which surely precludes future trade with EU?  These numbers are therefore the VERY BEST that DEXEU could manage.https://twitter.com/remain_central/status/958108992009621504

But if both Tory & Lab support no SM/CU, #Remainers are left with hard brexit either way & it means a border in Ireland.  I'm really struggling to see the upside.

I've always been clear my only red line is #StopBrexit so it cant be a surprise that I and many others struggle with the current Lab position, which does even seem to be consistent within his own FB.

953380490320449537 2018-01-16 21:36:36 UTC <robsmith286> @iTunes @mcsingerson I would check Recycle Bin to start with. If it's there, click Restore.  After that, check to see if other key folders are missing.
953214146505568257 2018-01-16 10:35:37 UTC <robsmith286> @markalexander_1 Agreed. It's the similarities shown by both Trump and May in being politically 'bullet-proof' regardless of their outrages that suggests an alternative narrative.  It was your response to Piers Morgan and the various responses from others that started the train of thought.
953210589840539648 2018-01-16 10:21:29 UTC <robsmith286> @markalexander_1 Agree with all your points. And timing is a key factor. Brexit no doubt helped his cause.

953090077151899649 2018-01-15 02:22:36 UTC <robsmith286> So, the end of this meagre thread.  It's all about deflection.  Trump isn't what he says he is. He's a clever, manipulative politician.  And Brexit isn't about taking back control. It's about removing the safeguards the EU have given us.  Beware the ides of March :) END

And no matter how bad things get, May is still here. Just like Trump.  And as with Trump, we might be fighting the wrong battle. /5
953084643657601026 2018-01-15 02:01:01 UTC <robsmith286> But now think of this in terms of Brexit. It's eerily similar. We have the most calamitous govt in the history of the UK.   I won't bother repeating their failings, we all know them.  But here is a weak/feeble PM with a slim (paid for) majority pushing through the most... /4
953082992427233281 2018-01-15 01:54:27 UTC <robsmith286> He thrives on being thought of as an idiot. It's his 'force field'. He IS an idiot in many ways but here he is a year later.  So the way to defeat Trump is to call him out as a career politician in financial debt to the Russians. His power would crumble. /3
953081627420299264 2018-01-15 01:49:02 UTC <robsmith286> What if Trump is the most accomplished career politician of his generation (something he would hate to be known as)?  Forget what you think of him personally. He says and does stuff that would have wiped out any politician/President before, inc. Bush, Reagan or Kennedy /2
953080177512341514 2018-01-15 01:43:16 UTC <robsmith286> I'm going to write a thread. It's not great but theres a point I want to get across and its... difficult.

953006883304103936 2018-01-15 20:52:01 UTC <robsmith286> You may disagree but it's interesting. For centuries, England & Eng Lang has insinuated itself on many continents by being friendly & hardy (US, India). Brexit is maybe 1st time we've been arrogant when a continent holds the cards. Maybe EU are taking back control? #StopBrexit

951993935962009600 2018-01-12 01:46:56 UTC <robsmith286> @MisterSoAngry I didn't say anything about federalism. I said reform. UK was always the thorn in EU side. Once were gone, of course they'll go for federal Europe. Why not?
951993262851620864 2018-01-12 01:44:15 UTC <robsmith286> @MisterSoAngry My view. Tories are so locked into media moguls like Dacre, Murdoch etc, it's not Con policies any more. Forget Blair. Been & gone. Cons want Brexit bc EU are introducing tax evasion laws in April 2019. Them & their mates will benefit from Brexit. Check out May's husband.
951992000991162368 2018-01-12 01:39:14 UTC <robsmith286> @MisterSoAngry I know you & I won't agree on much, but I will just say cheers for honest discussion. We have powers today to deport. EU didn't raise our national debt. Been there & rising since WWII. And EU negotiating in good faith. They're not fools. It's Davis playing the fool.
951987114471837696 2018-01-12 01:19:49 UTC <robsmith286> @MisterSoAngry It is capable of reform. Just not at gun-point, which was Cameron's approach.
951986819977109504 2018-01-12 01:18:39 UTC <robsmith286> @MisterSoAngry Brexiters no more/less stupid than remainers. Disagree on govt. Can't think of a more right wing (or at least non-centrist) govt in my lifetime. Definitely not Blairite. Either way, this govt is a ship of fools that will f*ck both sides. At some point well need to build bridges.
951978768884748288 2018-01-12 00:46:40 UTC <robsmith286> @MisterSoAngry You seem pretty well educated for someone going by name of MisterSoAngry (genuinely, not baiting you). I think even EU realise they make mistakes and need reform. But surely better in than out? I know you're a leaver but this govt make 'inept' look like an aspiration?

951264913921540097 2018-01-10 01:30:03 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian I hope so. #FBPE is a many-party community and there plenty of like-minded Tory, Lab, LibDem, Green etc followers. It's only the extremes (of which, strangely, Corbyn seems to have aligned himself with) that are fighting for party over country.
951261598349438977 2018-01-10 01:16:53 UTC <robsmith286> To be fair, on those guidelines BBC might have to stop reporting on Brexit altogether :)  #StopBrexit #FBPE #ToriesOut #WeAreTheOppositionNowhttps://twitter.com/TurnerMalcolm/status/950694962844327936

951171052062814214 2018-01-10 19:17:05 UTC <robsmith286> @TomKingTK So I think Supes ages at the standard rate because that's what his cells (like his mother & father) are programmed to do. But his invulnerability means his bits don't wear out.  So a 500 year old Superman is possible and he could still look good.  Think grey-haired Cary Grant :)

951132613024124929 2018-01-10 16:44:20 UTC <robsmith286> Very true.

950916909771436032 2018-01-09 02:27:13 UTC <robsmith286> @JRTomlinAuthor Not surprised. Tories planning on Singapore-by-the-Sea.  I wish it were a joke.
950916346648432643 2018-01-09 02:24:58 UTC <robsmith286> @Keir_Starmer @emailtimw No, I don't think that of Corbyn. I know he's being shrewd. But unfortunately we're getting to the endgame (transition agreement in March will basically dictate our course for next 3 years). By the time we know actual endgame, a ref may be too late. Tories counting on it. Arses.
950913563929047040 2018-01-09 02:13:55 UTC <robsmith286> Abso-bloody-lutely. I'm hoping a LOT that Scotland exits UK and remains in EU. Planning to move there. Especially if England decides to destroy itself.https://twitter.com/JRTomlinAuthor/status/950912283621736448

950910629359038466 2018-01-09 02:02:15 UTC <robsmith286> To be clear, my next vote(s) will be for @LibDems or @TheGreenParty regardless of voting area.  It may not unseat Brexiter in residence but I dont care. If all remainers do same, politics will change.  #StopBrexit #FBPE #ToriesOut #WeAreTheOppositionNow
950899882147098624 2018-01-09 01:19:33 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian One could argue it splits the vote but hey, Tory brexit or Lab brexit doesn't do remainers any good.
950898683511484417 2018-01-09 01:14:47 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian Yeah, we're having a thing today.  Corbyn basically came out last night and supported hard Brexit. Remainers are de-camping to @LibDems and @TheGreenParty  It's messy. See my TL if you're bored or can't sleep :)
950897294861271040 2018-01-09 01:09:16 UTC <robsmith286> Yes, because Germany, in no way a core member of EU, will be desperate to break up the union just for a deal with us Brits.

950891167050280960 2018-01-09 00:44:55 UTC <robsmith286> @Keir_Starmer @emailtimw 'Membership of' means a deal like Norway or Sweden. 'Benefits of' means some vague deal far off in the future, long past the point where the Tories have destroyed our reputation & relationship with the EU, and we've done a deal with US that sells NHS and buys chlorinated chicken

Its one step removed from saying no deal / hard brexit / WTO rules.  Bearing in mind I'm fighting to remain in EU, this is unacceptable.

950880824605446144 2018-01-09 00:03:49 UTC <robsmith286> @emailtimw Cheers, but that was October, Tim. His SM comments were last night.
950880289236144128 2018-01-09 00:01:42 UTC <robsmith286> @emailtimw I get the split and his caution. And up until yesterday he has trod a careful line.  But for months we've had @Keir_Starmer promoting SM & yesterday Corbyn ruled it out 100%. Even what Corbyn said was wrong (i.e. Norway & Sweden options exist).  He can't play a long game anymore.

There are a majority of politicians in Tory and Lab for remain and they need to see the overwhelming support for #StopBrexit  This is the way to protest.
950865273766195200 2018-01-09 23:02:02 UTC <robsmith286> @emailtimw No, just playing the cards we're dealt. May & Corbyn are for Brexit. It's now 100% @LibDems or @TheGreenParty #StopBrexit #FBPE #ToriesOut #WeAreTheOppositionNow
950856463727124483 2018-01-09 22:27:01 UTC <robsmith286> @TheGreenParty @LibDems @emailtimw You're missing the point. After last rout, Tories wont risk another GE for years. Likely not til near the end of the transition period. Way too late to prevent Tory brexit madness. But May 3rd is local elections & a chance to push remain message via LD & Greens. #StopBrexit #FBPE

But there are plenty of marginal seats.  But if every remainer voted LD or Green, that could really upset the political applecart.
950731003382960133 2018-01-09 14:08:29 UTC <robsmith286> Likewise. My vote will only ever go to @LibDems or @TheGreenParty from now on.  I don't care if it is a 'wasted vote' in my area.

950538291534757888 2018-01-08 01:22:43 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian I guess we'll have a better view when the transition period is agreed (or not) in March. My expectations are suitably low :)
950537184150474752 2018-01-08 01:18:19 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian Ah, okay. Maybe too cynical in my old age but I just don't trust those fuckers not to have a get-out clause.
950534827912105986 2018-01-08 01:08:57 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian I agree. But this is surely the single most untrustworthy & deceitful govt ever to govern these lands, seemingly controlled by media moguls.  The EU are locking the agreement into a legal doc but don't think it's signed yet?
950532478032281600 2018-01-08 00:59:37 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian True, but (and I'm no legal expert) if there's 'no deal', than anything agreed for Phase 1 could be deemed null and void (the old "nothing is agreed until everything's agreed" clause). Totally wrong, but I suspect that's what the Tories are thinking.
950523642429034496 2018-01-08 00:24:30 UTC <robsmith286> Absolutely, I'm convinced this has been Plan A all along. They knew they couldn't negotiate a deal and it's why they accepted 'no border' for Ireland (bc they won't have to make good on it if there's no deal), and why there are no impact ass'mnts.  #StopBrexit #FBPE #ToriesOuthttps://twitter.com/BrexitBin/status/950459399528644610

949800679664648192 2018-01-06 00:31:43 UTC <robsmith286> Prof, get your position. I've had Brexit fatigue for a few days now but not saying that's your issue. I may just have Jan blues, but think it's more that - this govt rolls on regardless.  And now retain sounds like a Tory initiative to quell dissent.

948732654526091269 2018-01-03 01:47:46 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian  Hi Macky, I followed up with Owen. I engaged with him (& still have nothing against him) but it seems he's of the Jeremy Corbyn school of Brexit :)  Being a bit cynical, I'd say he wants a Corbyn Brexit rather than a May brexit.  Doesn't really help anyone.
948730273008635904 2018-01-03 01:38:18 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian I'm the same. A nurse working a 12 hr shift for an unreasonable wage does more good in one day than Farage, Dacre, Dyson or Wetherspoon will ever do in their lifetimes. Tossers the lot.
948726926843269120 2018-01-03 01:25:00 UTC <robsmith286> It's one of those god-awful self improvement lists to remind the 'poor' (ie most normal people) how shit we are at everything and how the 'rich' (like May, Gove, Johnson, Farage etc) are so much cleverer and better.

948708905575747589 2018-01-03 00:13:23 UTC <robsmith286> @markpalexander @derekrootboy You make a decent point, Tom. Endless referendums won't sort out the issues at hand.  The only exception I'd take is with your numbering. June 2016 was the 2nd EUref. 1975 was the first.  Regardless of result, the Tories will destroy the UK.  #StopBrexit #FBPE

948680159930011648 2018-01-03 22:19:10 UTC <robsmith286> Good article @OwenJones84   Your words pinpoint the ultimate dilemma.  If, as remainers, we force a 2nd ref or somehow #StopBrexit, the exstremists will raise hell.  But if we all just stand down, the UK will suffer a socio-economic nightmare.

948627224927883264 2018-01-03 18:48:49 UTC <robsmith286> Has anybody looked into that 'extra funding' and how it's being applied/audited?  As with Trump, one should always follow the money.https://twitter.com/RJonesUX/status/948582548460003328

948620926211559424 2018-01-03 18:23:47 UTC <robsmith286> True. They continue with disastrous policies & autocratic behaviour with seemingly little fear of losing their voters.

948362964314349568 2018-01-02 01:18:45 UTC <robsmith286> @toadmeister I can't see Young Toby surviving much longer but, if he does, he will gnaw away at @theresa_may 's last shred of credibility like a caterpillar on a leaf.

948354824587931648 2018-01-02 00:46:24 UTC <robsmith286> @Ferretgrove @Andrew_Adonis @AVF_Scooby2000 Party politics is dying because of Brexit brought about by Tories.  But #FBPE as a movement with an eloquent spokesperson could have a dramatic effect.  Don't forget the journos and politicians are tracking this already.  #StopBrexit #FBPE

948008638869901312 2018-01-01 01:50:47 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian Oh I don't disregard him.  But you're right, Macky, I'll read through his TL tomorrow (too late now) and engage him.  Fair point, well made.
948004518020739072 2018-01-01 01:34:24 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian I agree. And I bet there'd be a lot of value in a discussion with Owen.  Unfortunately he didn't respond (why would he) so I'm kind of left with a 1-sided dialogue (mostly his).  But still, Owen's okay. There are too many brexidiots to worry about to give Owen a hard time.
948002059911090177 2018-01-01 01:24:38 UTC <robsmith286> Great thread from @GuitarMoog  on Day 1 of 2018.  Sadly, I'm guessing it will set the tone for the other 364.  #StopBrexit #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/GuitarMoog/status/947992105254780928
948000349272576000 2018-01-01 01:17:50 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian Yeah, I don't dislike Owen and he's a remainer. But as you may have seen from a couple of my recent tweets to him, he seems obsessed with bashing Clegg, Adonis etc and ignores the more obvious Brexit targets (Farage etc).  I suppose I just don't understand his stance.
947997310390333440 2018-01-01 01:05:46 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian Of course. How ya doing, Macky.
947992670030397440 2018-01-01 00:47:20 UTC <robsmith286> @dontbrexitfixit @enquirehere Agreed, and I guess we'll see this repeated across other disciplines (e.g. science) and industries.

947988241772400640 2018-01-01 00:29:44 UTC <robsmith286> @dontbrexitfixit @enquirehere Sadly, its the mood of the country (and the actions of the Home Office against those already resident) that is putting off medical staff from coming to UK.   I believe nursing applications from EU dropped by 97% earlier this year.

Suppose the difficulty is we won't know whether it's good or bad until we're in it.  Either way, good to have an honest, no BS talk across the trenches :)  Happy New Year to you and yours.
947277184900653056 2017-12-30 01:24:15 UTC <robsmith286> @enquirehere Good response. It's interesting, because most of the remain argument is based around democracy.  Most see this Tory party as being the most undemocratic gov ever (partially) elected, whatever you think of EU mob.  If things went really bad, would you sway you back to remain?
947273484673191941 2017-12-30 01:09:32 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian I know. Really turns the screws when you see a film fave be... well, less than honourable.  Bloody Hoffman! Spacey! I mean... crap. Christ alone knows what they were like in the 30s. But not all are arseholes.

Trump as POTUS supports white supremacy. Hence his 'friendliness' towards Russia.   Currently the EU are holding the line against fascism. No?

945809719792414720 2017-12-26 00:13:04 UTC <robsmith286> Yes to the first and to the second a caveat... the likes of Ken Clarke, Dominic Grieve etc are #remain stalwarts.

945428267418423297 2017-12-25 22:57:18 UTC <robsmith286> Hard brexit is a Tory strategy because they will be amongst the very few to benefit from it.  I don't believe that the majority of leave voters (i.e. non-brexstremists) would want to bring harm to the UK and would  therefore oppose a hard brexit.  #StopBrexit #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/MikeH_PR/status/945426186225831936

944265208800927744 2017-12-22 17:55:44 UTC <robsmith286> @davidschneider ALTERNATIVE IDEA: all remainers gleefully and without complaint accept a new blue passport.  In return, brexiters agree to #StopBrexit (actually making the blue passport even more functional).  Worth a try :)

944167912830578688 2017-12-22 11:29:06 UTC <robsmith286> @RogerPowell8 Perhaps you should ask why the EU are taking away their voting rights. It's all about democracy.
944160707477721090 2017-12-22 11:00:28 UTC <robsmith286> The Tories are one of the most undemocratic govts in the west today and youre complaining about the EU. Laughable.https://twitter.com/RogerPowell8/status/944157345990561792

944012624135671808 2017-12-21 01:12:03 UTC <robsmith286> I think the whole point is that they dont want discussion. All holding their breath hoping for hard Brexit on 29.03.19.   End of.

943955358573359104 2017-12-21 21:24:29 UTC <robsmith286> Agreed, no GE until 2021.

943951873287032838 2017-12-21 21:10:39 UTC <robsmith286> Yeah, realistically, every remainer, regardless of location, is going to have to vote @LibDems to drive that kind shift politically. @vincecable will have to be very vocal.  #StopBrexit #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/polbikers/status/943950939823771648

943946642541240320 2017-12-21 20:49:51 UTC <robsmith286> Remainers, we may need to revise our position in 2018.  In 2017, we exposed the economic absurdity of Brexit.  May & brexstremists know it's absurd & yet they continue to pursue & lie.  So it seems Brexit isn't an argument, it's a race. They just need to make it Mar 30 2019.

940025624915189760 2017-12-10 01:09:08 UTC <robsmith286> I love that song. So haunting and melodic. Have you ever heard Dylan's Visions of Johanna? The closest equivalent I can think of. More recently, you should look up The Felice Brothers.https://twitter.com/MineoLorraine/status/940023695388508161
940021572282343425 2017-12-10 00:53:02 UTC <robsmith286> Yes indeed. And as much as I love Dylan, Cohen wrote the best rock anthem ever - Hallelujahhttps://twitter.com/MineoLorraine/status/940019839195901952

940013425203253250 2017-12-10 00:20:39 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian Yeah, I've heard same, especially for writer's block. Either go for a walk or lie in a hot bath (submerged in water relieves brain from having to manage the limbs)  Also think I've heard said that a 30 min walk is more beneficial than a 1 hour run. Not sure how they quantify that
940009292425547776 2017-12-10 00:04:14 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian Yes, agreed. That pic was from my walk this morning. I need a long walk or my brain struggles.

939912072573440001 2017-12-10 17:37:55 UTC <robsmith286> Yeah, I've been thinking the same recently. UK has always been the recalcitrant child of the EU. Not always a bad thing but without us they can move forward with their plans.

938949753286676481 2017-12-07 01:54:00 UTC <robsmith286> Thanks for the link. I need to read this.

938948856326295552 2017-12-07 01:50:26 UTC <robsmith286> Oh yeah, as much as BBC might hack me off, Fox/Sky takes us into the twilight zone.  Just look at Fox support from Trump. Insane. We're talking far right propaganda.  As such I would defend BBC to the hilt.https://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/938945926760222721
938945632626147328 2017-12-07 01:37:38 UTC <robsmith286> @mrjamesob said basically the same thing this morning.   The little 'chuckle' from Davis when he said there were no reports, suggests he was confident of no repercussions. Hence they exist & he's 'taking one for the team'https://twitter.com/dontbrexitfixit/status/938923662379487232
938944212606836736 2017-12-07 01:31:59 UTC <robsmith286> No, I agree. Despite my concerns about bias, the licence should stay and is a good thing.  Where has this come from? I've been out all day. Are there moves afoot to remove it?https://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/938938459175075840
938936901129703424 2017-12-07 01:02:56 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian And yes, US punditry to be avoided at all costs.
938936650792660992 2017-12-07 01:01:56 UTC <robsmith286> Interesting point. I don't hate the BBC per se. As an organisation they bring a lot of good to broadcasting.  My issue is with the bias of their news coverage. Loads of examples on Twitter of their 'impartiality' driving a certain narrative.   Heartily recommend @mrjamesobhttps://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/938932726069190666
938932074001682432 2017-12-07 00:43:45 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian Macky, you can always say whatever you like to me, mate

938583096827564033 2017-12-06 01:37:02 UTC <robsmith286> So it would ssem the govt is willing to conceed on most if not all points (sensible stance) but the Irish border remains the intractable problem.https://twitter.com/lanieleaf/status/938580676554739713
938580537681285121 2017-12-06 01:26:52 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing No choice but to fight the fuckers. I'm reminded of this...pic.twitter.com/6GhA6Rg0QI
938577282377142273 2017-12-06 01:13:56 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing Very true. And Labour would get far more support by standing against Brexit now than if it waits until it's too late to prevent chaos.
938575400111878144 2017-12-06 01:06:27 UTC <robsmith286> Interesting approach. Likewise hope it has a cat in hells chance of succeeding.   #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE #A50Challenge #IBlockedTrumphttps://twitter.com/Grey_Wolfcub/status/938571884471488513
938574794097876992 2017-12-06 01:04:03 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing Agreed. Gerrymandering and removing undesirables from voting register is more subtle approach.

938568379522338818 2017-12-06 00:38:34 UTC <robsmith286> Is anyone else thinking that the Tory govt knows something we don't?   (I realise that's a stretch - stay with me).  They act like they're  invincible (e.g. Davis today) and daily they commit political atrocities that only a year ago would have brought down the govt.

938560946808729601 2017-12-06 00:09:01 UTC <robsmith286> I believe that Trump, like Farage, has only one objective. To cause division, conflict and chaos.   It diverts from personal inadequacies and generally offers an opportunity to increase their wealth at the expense of others.  It gets no deeper than that.https://twitter.com/JamesMelville/status/938556590625566720
938559010621489153 2017-12-06 00:01:20 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing Thanks Glenny. Take it easy, mate, and all the best.

938545702128496640 2017-12-06 23:08:27 UTC <robsmith286> Agreed eco. Sadly, while the govt has derelict in its duties, businesses have been preparing.

938542855752245248 2017-12-06 22:57:08 UTC <robsmith286> If EU27 vetos phase 2 trade talks until March (most likely at the moment) many banks, businesses & manufacturers will quickly activate their plans to shift operations to mainland Europe.

As such, have had to employ my  monkey's to mop her brow. They'll be back at their typewriters tomorrow.   Disingenuously yours, Davidhttps://twitter.com/dontbrexitfixit/status/937665722494439424

937491924382027776 2017-12-03 01:21:07 UTC <robsmith286> Cheers, Macky. Occurred to me that trying to explain to a gran or a neighbour why supporting #remain is crucial, would be a challenge.  So much detail. So many tweets. Of intricate nuance. So much of it not in MSM.  Needs to be boiled down to basic Q&A that people relate to.https://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/937486483837149184
937483508641157120 2017-12-03 00:47:40 UTC <robsmith286> We spend hours on Twitter railing against latest brexit outrage.  But many in UK don't see that detail. Their view of Brexit is shaped by MSM.  Has anyone produced a summary doc outlining history/consequences of Brexitshambles? Happy to make a start on it, if not.   Worthwhile?
937471488113954816 2017-12-03 23:59:54 UTC <robsmith286> Well when you put it like that... ah, fuck.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE #A50Challenge #IBlockedTrumphttps://twitter.com/TammRehgallag/status/937335378238992384
937470627086307328 2017-12-03 23:56:29 UTC <robsmith286> Like you, I suspect Brexit is only phase 1 of the master plan.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE #A50Challenge #IBlockedTrumphttps://twitter.com/WillBlackWriter/status/937468751246712832

937467914353029121 2017-12-03 23:45:42 UTC <robsmith286> Be fair, Andrew. I'm sure I read that he and his family all have EU passports. Why not have an EU pension.  Where better to be situated when Brexit turns out the lights, starves the poor and sends UK economy into downward spiral of biblical proportions?  #StopBrexit #ToriesOuthttps://twitter.com/dontbrexitfixit/status/937422974046613507
937463172742643714 2017-12-03 23:26:52 UTC <robsmith286> I don't know what bothers me more. That an MP can't remember his password and so has to tell his staff.

937459318701600768 2017-12-03 23:11:33 UTC <robsmith286> Yep. And Putin must be a clever guy. Obviously worked out years ago that the next great war wouldn't be fought on a battlefield but on the WWW.  That he found so many supporters in UK/US business and politics to enable him is deeply shameful.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/J_amesp/status/937411345502425088
937455712585871360 2017-12-03 22:57:13 UTC <robsmith286> Exactly right. One would hope someone senior in the WH has secretly changed the launch codes.  I'm joking... but only a little bit, sort of, slightly.   #ImpeachTrump #IblockedTrumphttps://twitter.com/acgrayling/status/937253530531958784

937437880208838656 2017-12-03 21:46:22 UTC <robsmith286> Agreed. I wonder how quickly Brexit would collapse if the brexiters had to personally pick up the 40bn divorce bill.

I'll go even further (and I can't believe I'm saying this in 2017) it's about fascism V liberalism.  We're back in the 1920s / 30s fighting a world war.

936416691382358016 2017-11-30 02:08:31 UTC <robsmith286> You write using the English language and yet even Sherlock Holmes couldn't decipher this. You're a bot/troll or had more drink than me.

936402739000639488 2017-11-30 01:13:05 UTC <robsmith286> Seems a bit old skool now, like watching West Wing. Trump has killed satire.  Wanker.https://twitter.com/zebra_crispy/status/936400220602191874
936401881835950080 2017-11-30 01:09:40 UTC <robsmith286> Yep, totally agree. The only way May can worm her way out of this is to lie, spin, deceive and misdirect everyone like she's never, ever managed before.  It won't end well.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE #A50Challengehttps://twitter.com/pondlifetwit/status/936399810067824641
936399840732467200 2017-11-30 01:01:34 UTC <robsmith286> Perhaps, but with the historical context it's why Leo Varadkar is putting down a heavy boot and telling May to go whistle if she thinks she's getting a border.https://twitter.com/DaveMc1925/status/936398205151039488

936397975332499457 2017-11-30 00:54:09 UTC <robsmith286> None. And we can't trade under WTO rules until we sign an agreement with the various members, like Spain (and which we currently have access to courtesy of our EU membership).  At least that's the way I read it. Bloody conundrum all this. Be easier to put a man on the moon.https://twitter.com/pondlifetwit/status/936396059479339008
936395880378322944 2017-11-30 00:45:49 UTC <robsmith286> A short article but... SUCH a good read.  All remainers should not pass up the opportunity to witness how May and her govt of imbeciles have exceeded even the great Monty Python for sheer silliness.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE #A50Challengehttps://twitter.com/janetfm/status/936393865430519808
936392642983874560 2017-11-30 00:32:58 UTC <robsmith286> That's a scandalous assertion, Macky.  Our decent, honest and reputable Tory gov reneging on a deal!  But yes. They'll be out of there like shit off a shovel. And it will all be the DUP's fault :)https://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/936390614324740097
936390514965995523 2017-11-30 00:24:30 UTC <robsmith286> I think the issue is that Tories need to resolve Irish border issue so they can move onto trade talks.  They'll basically say anything to anyone right now to make that happen.  Otherwise Tory gov will almost certainly collapse.https://twitter.com/DaveMc1925/status/936388531731214338
936388886435127296 2017-11-30 00:18:02 UTC <robsmith286> That's interesting because I'm sure someone from DUP was on the news saying such a deal would scupper their support for Tories.  And wouldn't that just require a border between NI and UK.  I can already see hardline brexiters frothing at the mouth :)https://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/936386153938333696

935664144186998784 2017-11-28 00:18:10 UTC <robsmith286> The EU game plan has thus far been masterful. Fair takes the breath away.  Tories have been and remain a national embarrassment.   #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE #A50Challengehttps://twitter.com/davidallengreen/status/935580694687907840
935662351696715777 2017-11-28 00:11:03 UTC <robsmith286> All I can say to that is... #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE #A50Challengehttps://twitter.com/guyverhofstadt/status/935599729068605441
935658334392344576 2017-11-28 23:55:05 UTC <robsmith286> So the final bill is likely to be 50bn or more.  Just imagine what that money could do for our services (NHS, Police etc) and investment for the future.  Brexit will be our greatest failure.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE
935651508728758272 2017-11-28 23:27:57 UTC <robsmith286> Agreed. And there are many UK  politicians, like Fox, who will be unelectable for decades to come.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE #A50Challengehttps://twitter.com/nickreeves9876/status/935576457690140675

935645063690047488 2017-11-28 23:02:21 UTC <robsmith286> Thats what I heard. But then ultimately the total figure can't be known (with ongoing payments for pensions, projects etc). Precisely why the EU rightly decided to negotiate principles not numbers.   #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE #A50Challengehttps://twitter.com/HelenEndBSL/status/935637602102849536

934204355921764352 2017-11-24 23:37:29 UTC <robsmith286> I know! We may need to expand to a Top 10. Lost Mogg because I was reminded he's an idiot that's not even in the cabinet and that same clever person suggested Hunt to fill the gap. But there are so many candidates.https://twitter.com/PeeJay80c/status/934202577620742145
934202424650354688 2017-11-24 23:29:49 UTC <robsmith286> Yeah, so Hunt goes in at 4 and Fox drops to 5. It's so difficult. They're all so inept.https://twitter.com/gingermarauder/status/934201582610239489

933100439087718403 2017-11-21 22:30:55 UTC <robsmith286> I don't disagree. But likely all remain parties would have to merge and see a massive upswing in membership to give them the power to oppose.

933099762508693505 2017-11-21 22:28:14 UTC <robsmith286> Nah, think you're right, Valkyrie. If dodgy EU Withdrawal Bill can get through w/out a scratch, it's not looking good.

933047809770696705 2017-11-21 19:01:47 UTC <robsmith286> Yeah, Scotland needs to go it's own way and stay in EU. Wales should do the same.

933044886282162176 2017-11-21 18:50:10 UTC <robsmith286> Yeah, and that's how I'll take it. Looks like EUWB will pass without trouble. Bastards, the lot.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/tweetingasme/status/933043642696110081

932786592346988544 2017-11-20 01:43:48 UTC <robsmith286> @nberlat @ianthescian Now following. Ever read any comics? Try V for Vendetta or Watchmen by Alan Moore. The films, sadly, lost some of the intricacies of the printed page.
932784836145811457 2017-11-20 01:36:49 UTC <robsmith286> Have you seen The Lives of Others? Really, really worth watching.

932783014882545665 2017-11-20 01:29:35 UTC <robsmith286> I know and love most of the names there. Duvernay and Eisentein I'll now check out. I had a big B&W phase in earlier years. Unbeatable.  Coen Bros. Big Lebowski. Opening scene. Dylan soundtrack. Steve Buscemi, one of my fave actors. Wow.https://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/932781680271773697
932780116865900544 2017-11-20 01:18:04 UTC <robsmith286> Yep. Following. She has some great tweets. Cheers.  What's your filmic theme. What's your drivers?https://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/932778938413322240
932778466386341888 2017-11-20 01:11:31 UTC <robsmith286> Absolutely.  Film, TV, book, comic. Always appreciated.https://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/932777624362995713

932777261174009856 2017-11-20 01:06:43 UTC <robsmith286> @ianthescian And cheers for tweets, Macky. Always insightful.
932774214666506240 2017-11-20 00:54:37 UTC <robsmith286> Well said @13sarahmurphy   And tonight's brexapocalypse (a full year away from an actual brexit) must be a hint of the devastation to come?  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/13sarahmurphy/status/932499225757339648

932772440647839745 2017-11-20 00:47:34 UTC <robsmith286> Can't remember if I pointed you towards Mike, @ianthescian   He's definitely worth watching.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/mikegalsworthy/status/932681565351456768
932767804234792960 2017-11-20 00:29:09 UTC <robsmith286> Nice. Liking @campaignforleo and @simoncoveney - they speak directly & honestly (whatever one's political allegiance).  Here's hoping RoI can help to derail Brexit.  Check my TL over last few hours. Brexapocalypse has begun (except on BBC).  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/932761082971721730
932760217938546688 2017-11-20 23:59:00 UTC <robsmith286> Really? They didn't even mention it?  I bet they had May doing some tour in a factory.

932756735365926913 2017-11-20 23:45:10 UTC <robsmith286> I too struggle with Labour.

932746679840894976 2017-11-20 23:05:12 UTC <robsmith286> @itvnews tonight.  Well worth watching.  Brexit, lead item, was reasonably balanced. Didn't shy away from the negatives.  Their piece on NHS was enough to make you cry.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE
932744464434688001 2017-11-20 22:56:24 UTC <robsmith286> I agree. But our govt and the BBC seem happy enough to dismiss recent protests as a minority gathering. Which they weren't.  You're right that politicians have to believe the tipping point now favours remain.https://twitter.com/robertpossnett1/status/932741744625704962
932742829675335680 2017-11-20 22:49:54 UTC <robsmith286> Yeah. Brexit has already become a global embarrassment for UK.   We have flushed ourselves down the political toilet.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/RichardLinsleyH/status/932739178399399936
932741919259717632 2017-11-20 22:46:17 UTC <robsmith286> Agreed. We can only hope.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/Glensailing/status/932738573580816384

932736206638669824 2017-11-20 22:23:35 UTC <robsmith286> 3 options, I think.  1. Legal. As @JolyonMaugham and @thatginamiller or Withdrawal Bill. But govt can probably contest/ignore.  2. People. But needs a GE and a remain govt in power.  3. EU/RoI. EU and RoI make Brexit illegal due to hard border.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/Glensailing/status/932730733705261058

931709477405036544 2017-11-17 02:23:44 UTC <robsmith286> Yep. I am. So... #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/EUflagmafia/status/931640827398455297
931705601540976640 2017-11-17 02:08:20 UTC <robsmith286> The whole mess is intertwined.  Tories are dependent on DUP & everyone (especially EU) are saying 'no hard border'. Forget divorce payment & EU citz rights, it's the border that's key. IMHO. A border would end GFA.  Then all hell breaks lose as far as int'l politics is concernedhttps://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/931696720433631233
931692574066270208 2017-11-17 01:16:34 UTC <robsmith286> Ah, Macky, you've hit the nail on the head. Tory Govt believe the Daily Fail lies that EU are bumbling, authoritarian,  inadequates and only we can set them straight.  Idiots.  Whatever anyone might think of him, @campaignforleo told May, to her face, she's deluded. Love it.https://twitter.com/ianthescian/status/931688969766567937
931688085267640320 2017-11-17 00:58:44 UTC <robsmith286> Agreed. Govt is ultimately accountable.  So if you pay money to a charity, you want to know that most of that money goes to those in need. Not to a corporation generating profit.  BTW, I donate to charities. This is not an opportunity for me to excuse myself.https://twitter.com/malhayes/status/931680894099836928
931679467927474176 2017-11-17 00:24:29 UTC <robsmith286> Okay, so I'm entirely pragmatic.  Govt should be supporting ill and disadvantaged children.  But we know they're not.  So CinN is a good thing.  But if <50% of what is raised tonight is actually spent on helping children, then it's a scam. No?https://twitter.com/GHNeale/status/931671879034834944
931671645697314817 2017-11-17 23:53:24 UTC <robsmith286> I love this from Tusk.

931665189551919105 2017-11-17 23:27:45 UTC <robsmith286> Yeah. But wen you've got to pay for essentials like Rees-Mogg's estate and hush money for Johnson's gaffs - and you've got the EU making unreasonable demands - how can you balance it all.  I'm sure the poor won't mind.  (Nice pic, BTW).  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE https://twitter.com/dontbrexitfixit/status/931660761943900160

931654182741991424 2017-11-17 22:44:01 UTC <robsmith286> No correlation intended. Just making the point that our current likely outcome (no-deal) puts us in a worse position than Canada for FTA.  There is no option for a borderless Ireland with Brexit. https://twitter.com/brsmith909/status/931650188334325760
931649730307817477 2017-11-17 22:26:19 UTC <robsmith286> Agreed. Sadly even Norway option looks like a remote option now.  Even Canada FTA seems to be unattainable.   #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPE https://twitter.com/brsmith909/status/931648168143572992

930958464821682176 2017-11-15 00:39:29 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing So true  But when you look at a map, you're always going be neighbouring some sort of problematic area.  Maybe try ROI. It's EU and far less likely they will be targeted by any ordnance.
930954974019940354 2017-11-15 00:25:36 UTC <robsmith286> Agreed, it's all about where you are  geographically when the hammer falls.  Best to be outside of the blast zone.https://twitter.com/Glensailing/status/930954149692366848
930954085196554240 2017-11-15 00:22:04 UTC <robsmith286> Cheers, Valkyrie.  I'm good with the cold (prefer it). I'll check out the north. https://twitter.com/DSpringbottom/status/930951859019374592
930953530357223424 2017-11-15 00:19:52 UTC <robsmith286> No, its not. I'll keep fighting whatever.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/Glensailing/status/930951722108964866
930953274911612929 2017-11-15 00:18:51 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing Thanks, Glen. I know it'll work out for you. You've made the commitment.   Timing isn't right for me just yet. But, whatever happens, I won't be here March 2019.
930950799735345152 2017-11-15 00:09:01 UTC <robsmith286> Yeah, that's where I'm at. Been looking at all the angles for too long.  At some point you just need to dive and swim. See where it takes you.https://twitter.com/Glensailing/status/930948710900621313
930948284914524161 2017-11-15 23:59:01 UTC <robsmith286> Ah that's the phrase. One life, live it.  Cheers, I needed a reminder.https://twitter.com/Glensailing/status/930947722114367488
930947797406437377 2017-11-15 23:57:05 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing Good, glad you have a plan. I'll be doing similar, just haven't finalised what it is yet. Need to get my skates on.
930947204025671685 2017-11-15 23:54:44 UTC <robsmith286> I suspect the final cost to UK.PLC will be far greater than any 'divorce settlement' figure.https://twitter.com/Glensailing/status/930945736388284417
930945035046146049 2017-11-15 23:46:07 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing Same here!
930944944226947072 2017-11-15 23:45:45 UTC <robsmith286> @Glensailing True. Just feels like any #Remain 'gains' are ignored by a govt that ploughs on regardless towards cliff-edge.  But, as they say, every dog has it's day.
930943707041484800 2017-11-15 23:40:50 UTC <robsmith286> In olden days (pre-2015), PM would have called a COBRA session to cancel A50.  #StopBrexit #ToriesOut #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/MollyMEP/status/930712309525307393

930933972078604288 2017-11-15 23:02:09 UTC <robsmith286> Exactly. May is reading from and following the right-wing Trump manifesto.  Why? God knows, she was a remainer 2 years ago.

930930283964260358 2017-11-15 22:47:30 UTC <robsmith286> Mad idea. Perhaps @CarolineLucas Greens should merge with @vincecable Lib Dems and all #Remain MPs should join this convergence party.

889633526743695361 2017-07-24 23:48:56 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Nah, May is a dead duck towing the line. Google: May, Dacre, Gove, Murdoch, Farage. They're all linked financially. Brexit saves them tax.
889630461047263234 2017-07-24 23:36:45 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Odd isn't it. May & Hammond remainers (or were). Could go either way. Tweets earlier saying better Tory remain than Corbyn leave!

889585605306445831 2017-07-24 20:38:30 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb We could. 3 months and we could. We just don't. Germany and I think Belgium are very hard line on this.
889583601884573699 2017-07-24 20:30:33 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Mate, if theyre not wanted we could deport them now. Without leaving EU. Its our Tory idiot gov that don't enforce
889582206917783554 2017-07-24 20:25:00 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Yeah, but you end up with worst result. Those that you need - nurses, doctors etc - stay away. EU nurse app'ns down by 96% from last year.
889579124506972160 2017-07-24 20:12:45 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Okay, so you want hard line isolationist Britain?   Not going to end well. For all the reasons posted prev.
889577210776047616 2017-07-24 20:05:09 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Not an issue in any area. We depend on immigrants from all over. Why Brexit is bad.
889576778754396164 2017-07-24 20:03:26 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Just think how much Tory gov has softened it's tone in last few months. Even the Daily Mail and the Sun have backed off
889576263513513984 2017-07-24 20:01:23 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Only for the immigrants from EU. We've had control over immigrants from RoW for years. Done nothing. You think that'll change post Brexit?
889573991832276993 2017-07-24 19:52:21 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Yeah, I know. But even hard brexiteers in gov are running from that one
889573667436417024 2017-07-24 19:51:04 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Only for EU. Not rest of world.
889572680726392836 2017-07-24 19:47:09 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Thing is, we leave SM, our economy tanks. Everyone is poorer except the already rich. FOM control gives little over what we've already got
889567314257096706 2017-07-24 19:25:49 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb 1. Leave EU only controls EU immigrants. Not rest of world (maj of immigrants) 2. W/out immigrant labour for farms, health etc we're screwed
889565107931545601 2017-07-24 19:17:03 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb No, but the point is we *do* have the power to deport. Unlike Germany and other EU countries that do, we dont. You were sold lies.
889563356956418049 2017-07-24 19:10:06 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Did you know we already have powers to deport immigrants after 3 months? Our lovely Tory gov decline to use them
889562065903464450 2017-07-24 19:04:58 UTC <robsmith286> @Essexdb Instead of trolling me and calling all Scots spongers, how about tweeting 3 benefits of Brexit...

874574121962745856 2017-06-13 10:28:14 UTC <robsmith286> @RosChappell Good point, left and right both went for populist vote this time round. Labour seemed to be softening their view on Brexit as of yesterday.
874431255579897857 2017-06-12 01:00:32 UTC <robsmith286> - for a multitude of reasons - rejected it. This isn't about vagaries of EU law. This is right wing orgs seizing  chance for global power
874430503662780417 2017-06-12 00:57:32 UTC <robsmith286> Macron (and latterly Merkel) reinforced the fight-back. May fought her election on hard Brexit (populist movement), and the British people..
874429628219363332 2017-06-12 00:54:04 UTC <robsmith286> ...so there's another link to Russia. Other right wing orgs started a take-over but Austrians were first to reject ...
874429294335938562 2017-06-12 00:52:44 UTC <robsmith286> ...There's the Trump/Farage link. Unlikely Trump is in bed with Russians but his son in law owes major money ($bns) to Russians...
874428917679104001 2017-06-12 00:51:14 UTC <robsmith286> ...EU referendum result basically gave the Populist movement momentum and helped put the orange idiot Trump into power...
874428633494024192 2017-06-12 00:50:06 UTC <robsmith286> Sorry for such a long-winded answer but here's my thoughts (1/4)....https://twitter.com/RosChappell/status/874393750574968832
874382500281319424 2017-06-12 21:46:47 UTC <robsmith286> With new deputy a hard remainer, many Tories remainers, and new Tory goddess Davidson shouting #softbrexit is Maybot now Soft Brexit Queen?https://twitter.com/robsmith286/status/874378825941098497
874378825941098497 2017-06-12 21:32:11 UTC <robsmith286> Ok, we go into negotiations with EU as a nation divided, technically no PM & EU licking their lips at the prospect. What could go wrong.
874378357827407873 2017-06-12 21:30:20 UTC <robsmith286> I'm surprised you weren't considered for the cabinet :) Bloody better choice than Gove.https://twitter.com/OwenJones84/status/874338471682482178
874376522311884801 2017-06-12 21:23:02 UTC <robsmith286> There's a petition saying just that. Received 14,000 signatures apparently and was forwarded to Labour HQhttps://twitter.com/dontbrexitfixit/status/874370677851246602
874016927672348677 2017-06-11 21:34:08 UTC <robsmith286> Wish we could send all Tory MPs to govern Craggy Island. They'd still manage to f*ck it up.https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot/status/874014434968174592
874004210077106176 2017-06-11 20:43:36 UTC <robsmith286> Sadly yes, they're in a sinking ship and won't even use the brain's God gave them to plug the holeshttps://twitter.com/Harryslaststand/status/873916917366611968

873971768238759936 2017-06-11 18:34:41 UTC <robsmith286> And with the return of Gove we have a Lucius Malfoy to line up with Hunt as Voldermort in The Coalition of Crackpotshttps://twitter.com/Hepworthclare/status/873967628972433410
873940062945374208 2017-06-11 16:28:42 UTC <robsmith286> No, I think you'll find @EllieJPrice used the correct pronunciation...https://twitter.com/VladimirFarage/status/873938701533020164
873938309671727105 2017-06-11 16:21:44 UTC <robsmith286> @drjanaway Well that makes more sense... he's doing a bang-up job. No wonder she kept him on.
873935720599216132 2017-06-11 16:11:27 UTC <robsmith286> WAIT A MINUTE... you mean after all these months of watching the NHS disintegrate, there's been a Health Secretary?https://twitter.com/drjanaway/status/873934131993784320
873934437645418497 2017-06-11 16:06:21 UTC <robsmith286> @NickCowern Agreed, Brexit is lose:lose. Just hoping we could keep the losses to a minimum.
873930984273719298 2017-06-11 15:52:38 UTC <robsmith286> We know we're leaving the EU, just no need to flush UK down the pan by going for a #hardBrexit - #softbrexit would resolve Scots & NI issueshttps://twitter.com/NickCowern/status/873926758810222592
873916687959117825 2017-06-11 14:55:49 UTC <robsmith286> Just a thought. Maybe no one in the Tory Party wants her job right now. Happy to watch her take the blows and swoop in when things calm downhttps://twitter.com/D_Raval/status/873645251830972416
873712588823162880 2017-06-10 01:24:48 UTC <robsmith286> Exactly, Rachael. This is clearly just part of a pre-planned u-turn.https://twitter.com/Rachael_Swindon/status/873687348323774465

873237306127396865 2017-06-09 17:56:12 UTC <robsmith286> Prediction to make your toes curl... May deposed within 2 months, Boris becomes PM, election in autumn - Boris (Trump) vs Corbyn (Sanders)
873036796363292674 2017-06-08 04:39:27 UTC <robsmith286> DUP - don't  do deal with @theresa_may   She will screw you over.
873033869993295877 2017-06-08 04:27:49 UTC <robsmith286> #DailyMail and #thesun headlines didn't help #TheresaMay then...
873031042453524480 2017-06-08 04:16:35 UTC <robsmith286> @UKLabour could still surpass 262 forecast seats - May is gone either way...
873023897842491402 2017-06-08 03:48:11 UTC <robsmith286> @theresa_may gone in 48 hours.
873015580030373892 2017-06-08 03:15:08 UTC <robsmith286> Thanks to all LD that tactically supported Labour. TBH, I was going to support LD, but had to vote Lab in my area. Corbyn wasn't a mistake.
873008787455606785 2017-06-08 02:48:09 UTC <robsmith286> If nothing else, it looks like May has become too toxic for the Tories.
872995231221915649 2017-06-08 01:54:17 UTC <robsmith286> Further point, @nick_clegg is potential future PM based on his losing speech.https://twitter.com/robsmith286/status/872994307095089152

872983047490207744 2017-06-08 01:05:52 UTC <robsmith286> Farage now so rattled by Corbyn he's coming back into politics. Oh well, win some, lose some :)

872193418834923523 2017-06-06 20:48:10 UTC <robsmith286> Yes, May's rhetoric, ideology and policies strikingly close to those of Trump's  - as well as UKIP's. Erosion of Human Rights is final strawhttps://twitter.com/demindblower/status/872188562594304000
872158242364940288 2017-06-06 18:28:23 UTC <robsmith286> Why is there a party political broadcast for the Tories on @SkyNews (and I assume @BBCNews) - will each party be given same coverage?

870375826746900481 2017-06-01 20:25:42 UTC <robsmith286> @ParisClimate if nothing can happen until 2020, announcement from @realDonaldTrump is just hot air (pun intended). Will be impeached asap.
870362964938956801 2017-06-01 19:34:36 UTC <robsmith286> @BarackObama - don't suppose you still have any influence with authorities to deal with that Trump bloke? Just asking for friend :) Be well.
870347481212751874 2017-06-01 18:33:04 UTC <robsmith286> (2/2) or... live in UK and remember that whatever happens in US gets repeated in UK pretty damn quickly... be on your toes, Brits

869666215739916288 2017-05-30 21:25:58 UTC <robsmith286> @BBCNews tonight's 10pm news displayed disgraceful bias towards @theresa_may @BBCNews - get some journalistic integrity. Vote @jeremycorbyn
869318229558165504 2017-05-29 22:23:11 UTC <robsmith286> #BattleForNumber10 the surprise tonight wasn't @theresa_may mediocre performance, it was that @jeremycorbyn performance was really very good
869241180042735617 2017-05-29 17:17:01 UTC <robsmith286> @PoliticalKel @BarackObama Spoken like a true President.
869233288921088001 2017-05-29 16:45:40 UTC <robsmith286> @BraddJaffy @LauraWalkerKC Ditto. He's the PM the UK needs.
868933362819506177 2017-05-28 20:53:52 UTC <robsmith286> @judithmknott @StevePeers Maybe neither are what you'd call great performers but  DJT is @POTUS! He's holding everyone's beer. Take my chances with Boris over May.
868929590596710407 2017-05-28 20:38:52 UTC <robsmith286> @jeremycorbyn take the SNP deal, Jeremy. Its a win:win for both parties. At the moment you're polls are up BC of anti-May sentiment.
868901930604662784 2017-05-28 18:48:58 UTC <robsmith286> @eddireader Yep, totally agree.
868901197977186305 2017-05-28 18:46:03 UTC <robsmith286> Haven't trawled my timeline yet but has @POTUS made any comment on Mississippi shootings, the 2 dead heroes in portland or Merkel statement?
868898606933323777 2017-05-28 18:35:45 UTC <robsmith286> @eddireader Yeah, as people we're too close ideologically to be split by a geo-political boundary. It's about what's best for each country financially.
868727262388133888 2017-05-28 07:14:54 UTC <robsmith286> @LouiseMensch @TruthEqualsFact @Madsonovich So true, but then I wasn't after operational responsibility. Thought I'd be like Trump and just dabble.
868622971904118784 2017-05-27 00:20:29 UTC <robsmith286> @GeorgeTakei And should be illegal.
868622411394162688 2017-05-27 00:18:15 UTC <robsmith286> @robreiner @KatrinaHagen2 Thanks Katrina, but please, I'm just Rob to friends :) Welcome to Twitter, I'm new too.
868621603114029057 2017-05-27 00:15:03 UTC <robsmith286> @POTUS I wonder this. As newly-elected president with RUS thing hanging over ur head - why not play it cool n calm? Is here a timeline?
868617206996885508 2017-05-27 23:57:34 UTC <robsmith286> @KatrinaHagen2 @robreiner Well he's already had his press there.  Not long.
868615799581417473 2017-05-27 23:51:59 UTC <robsmith286> As Englishman that loves Scotland, hope they stay with UK. But if #Hardbrexit happy they go #indyref2 and leave. No point dragging them down
868612723323662336 2017-05-27 23:39:45 UTC <robsmith286> @atDavidHoffman And physically unfit. Apparently can't keep his eyes open or fulfil his engagements. Lightweight.
868609745728548864 2017-05-27 23:27:56 UTC <robsmith286> @AssisiCat Maybe he'll quote some Beiber lyrics in his address to Mr Trudeau. Oh please :)
868608673739833344 2017-05-27 23:23:40 UTC <robsmith286> If I ruled the world: POTUS = Obama / Hillary UK PM = N Clegg or Corbyn  France = Macron Germany = Merkle Daily Mail EIC = @LouiseMensch :)
868602733305221121 2017-05-27 23:00:04 UTC <robsmith286> Both of these heroes are the antithesis of Trump government. There should be statues erected in their honour.https://twitter.com/studentactivism/status/868528513883807745
868601690089500672 2017-05-27 22:55:55 UTC <robsmith286> @SoSofieFatale @tarapalmeri I doubt DJT knows the difference. For shame
868600781435531266 2017-05-27 22:52:18 UTC <robsmith286> @KatrinaHagen2 We all need Sutherland from Designated Survivor. Or better yet, Jed Bartlett.
868597908614066176 2017-05-27 22:40:53 UTC <robsmith286> @IanDunt @MichaelPDeacon Look, it's not difficult. I'm a remainer but Farron wont win. May's only interest is in being PM come what may. Corbyn is the only choice.
868596195798777856 2017-05-27 22:34:05 UTC <robsmith286> @thehighlandway Actually, I haven't seen May for days. Tory echelon got her locked in a cupboard for fear of losing more votes?
868591759777038342 2017-05-27 22:16:27 UTC <robsmith286> @realDonaldTrump @debilu2 @JustinTrudeau All the best, Justin. Stand your ground :)
868585302864142337 2017-05-27 21:50:48 UTC <robsmith286> @SKZCartoons Thanks for healthy debate, SKZ. Hope you find a publisher.
868582355891625984 2017-05-27 21:39:05 UTC <robsmith286> @SKZCartoons Honestly? I can't answer those questions. I just don't believe he was anti-UK
868580143085834240 2017-05-27 21:30:18 UTC <robsmith286> @Baddiel It's because all/most manufacturers want to consolidate on unified model. And they will do this every 6 months whether they like it or not!
868578809309790208 2017-05-27 21:25:00 UTC <robsmith286> @SKZCartoons 1) Think JCs ideology/actions nothing more than striving for a united Ireland. 2) From ur cartoons, don't think ur/my UK ideals are at odds.
868573447538036736 2017-05-27 21:03:41 UTC <robsmith286> @nickreeves9876 Agreed, >50% of immigration is from non-EU countries anyway. Taking back 'sovereignty' is  a populist rant. Tories scared of UKIP overthrow.
868569497283809281 2017-05-27 20:48:00 UTC <robsmith286> @SKZCartoons Your point being that he wanted the violence to continue? Don't buy it. Again, no fan of JC but I think it's more nuanced.
868566883133526016 2017-05-27 20:37:36 UTC <robsmith286> @SKZCartoons Not a massive fan of Corbyns but even I can see his actions were ultimately directed towards peace. Just easy pickings for Tories.
868563932306444291 2017-05-27 20:25:53 UTC <robsmith286> @Kelly_Jackson88 In all seriousness, yor mum should plan to get to airport well ahead of flight time and have a few drinks. Worked for me for many years!
868545433156673536 2017-05-27 19:12:22 UTC <robsmith286> No, it was about looking 'prime minesterial'. Looked more 'dictatorial.https://twitter.com/Kevin_Maguire/status/868423228175331328
868538350344515584 2017-05-27 18:44:14 UTC <robsmith286> Believe when red play blue in FA Cup, the winning colour indicates election victory - red Lab vs blue Tory. #justsaying

868063521652781057 2017-05-26 11:17:26 UTC <robsmith286> Obviously someone lent Trump a book on WWII and he thinks it's an intelligence briefinghttps://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/867863828956143616

867868709838360576 2017-05-25 22:23:19 UTC <robsmith286> @bbcqt lots of great comments/questions from audience tonight. Panel responses lacking. With exception of Colin Parry.

867831860814020608 2017-05-25 19:56:53 UTC <robsmith286> @SenSanders Well done, Bernie. Sure it won't be long until the Trumps are America's wealthiest family - it's his budget afterall
867803337076486144 2017-05-25 18:03:33 UTC <robsmith286> @LRB @mrjamesob Absolutely best article ever written. Even explains Brexit. One question: 'double-cunting', is that what they did with Trumps budget?
867768852570046464 2017-05-25 15:46:31 UTC <robsmith286> @jimwaterson I'd do the 'hold my beer thing' but.. well... Trump's got everyone covered...

866103901405237249 2017-05-20 01:30:36 UTC <robsmith286> And actually, while I'm the mood, if the UK election was a genuine 4-horse race, the person I'd actually vote as PM is @jon_bartley.
866102483709562885 2017-05-20 01:24:58 UTC <robsmith286> Was going to bed but find am weirdly addicted to Twitter! Would also accept Selina Meyer, Tom Kirkman or even Frank Underwood as @POTUS. TY.
866097422321278977 2017-05-20 01:04:51 UTC <robsmith286> Nah, must correct you. MP team always wrote sketches that exaggerated real life. They didn't make up stuff about weird, unbelievable shit :)https://twitter.com/PalmerReport/status/865709848029220870
866093088841904129 2017-05-20 00:47:38 UTC <robsmith286> OK, I'm going to bed now. When I wake up can I please have Jed Bartlet as @POTUS and literally anyone else as UK PM. Thank you very much.
866077851908538372 2017-05-20 23:47:05 UTC <robsmith286> @LouiseMensch Wow, you have some vile posts directed at you, just seen a few. That's when you know you're doing the right thing. Crack on :)
866072040515784708 2017-05-20 23:23:59 UTC <robsmith286> Is there a need to indict (while sitting)? Would not impeach and replace with a grown up be the ultimate goal?
866063258586894337 2017-05-20 22:49:06 UTC <robsmith286> @NeoBabeofSpring Agreed, I'll probably have to go that way. Just wish JC was a bit clearer on his Bexit negotiating stance. I don't really get their play.
866060753190703104 2017-05-20 22:39:08 UTC <robsmith286> @NeoBabeofSpring Stoke on Trent south
866049215071440898 2017-05-20 21:53:17 UTC <robsmith286> @jasper_hd I'm starting to think the same. TM reminds me too much of MT (maggie) - never realised they had the same initials reversed - bad omen!
866043958639689728 2017-05-20 21:32:24 UTC <robsmith286> My dilemma. My area Lab/Tory split. Do I vote LD in vain hope of best Brexit deal (likely wasted vote) or do I go Lab and risk JC as PM?https://twitter.com/ThatTimWalker/status/866032841582313473
866034597871669248 2017-05-20 20:55:12 UTC <robsmith286> @prodnose Ah,m the best time to tweet. Until you wake up next morning and remember... :)
866025270771429376 2017-05-20 20:18:09 UTC <robsmith286> Not sure on that. Can't bring myself to vote May but struggle where my vote goes. Suggest many others the same. Could be a messy 3-way tie.https://twitter.com/ThatTimWalker/status/866010590225076224
865364696668532736 2017-05-18 00:33:16 UTC <robsmith286> @sarahkendzior @benjalord I'd like to slightly amend an earlier tweet.  It's not Putin... It's not Russia...  Follow the money on Trump's business deals.
865360068778373122 2017-05-18 00:14:52 UTC <robsmith286> @judicature Ah, got ya. Yeah, like previous tweet, health AND education should be free at point of need. Benefits everyone. #bbcqt
865359300667088898 2017-05-18 00:11:49 UTC <robsmith286> @lefthub Erm, doubt Germany would pay for my family's education. Sorry, have I missed the point?
865357826482462722 2017-05-18 00:05:58 UTC <robsmith286> Have to forget Putin. Like Watergate, they have to follow the money. Trump, Pence, Flynn - they're connected business-wise to Russia.https://twitter.com/SarahLSmith677/status/865346961674842113
865355569854640129 2017-05-18 23:57:00 UTC <robsmith286> @jon_bartley You may have converted a few unbelievers tonight. Good showing, Jon.
865354889551122432 2017-05-18 23:54:17 UTC <robsmith286> @judicature Interesting, HIS FREE UNI? His personal education?
865354526966075393 2017-05-18 23:52:51 UTC <robsmith286> @davidjville I'd agree. Health and education are cornerstones of society. If we're going to be governed (which we are) they should be funded through tax
865347835570659333 2017-05-18 23:26:16 UTC <robsmith286> @davidjville (2) Like everyone, happy to fund dependents etc but level of UK debt is so high and not reducing. How much more do we have to put in is ?
865347045640601601 2017-05-18 23:23:07 UTC <robsmith286> @davidjville (1) Heh, no that's a fair question. She's a good girl, works hard. But to the question about tax, well you have to deal with the cards dealt
865343582416371712 2017-05-18 23:09:22 UTC <robsmith286> Yep, loving Vince Cable's honesty on uni tuition fees. Someone at some point has to pay. (Yes, I have daughter in uni... groan).
865338157163839489 2017-05-18 22:47:48 UTC <robsmith286> To be fair, Jon Bartley is also petty convincing on #bbcq. Impressed.
865336354200326144 2017-05-18 22:40:38 UTC <robsmith286> Very much warming to Vince Cable on #bbcq Could see him as PM were that an option.
865329407363346438 2017-05-18 22:13:02 UTC <robsmith286> It's all kicking off on #bbcqt tonight   LD and green reps the voices of reason so far
864643482450890752 2017-05-16 00:47:25 UTC <robsmith286> @SethAMandel True (silly marketing people). But aren't we on Twitter? Does spelling, grammar etc really count for much :)
864626158964494337 2017-05-16 23:38:34 UTC <robsmith286> @SethAMandel Or from a UK perspective... May, you live in interesting times.
864623371920842752 2017-05-16 23:27:30 UTC <robsmith286> @GOP if #ComeyMemo evidence stands up, you need to prove your worth as elected representatives...
864540542662836224 2017-05-16 17:58:22 UTC <robsmith286> Does this undermine the WH case against Wikileaks?https://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/864292009468710912
862771374238162945 2017-05-11 20:48:19 UTC <robsmith286> @BBCR2Country @WhisperingBob @BHarrisCountry Great show, Bob. Any chance of hearing some Felice Brothers one week? All the best.
862420520435929088 2017-05-10 21:34:09 UTC <robsmith286> Unsure of the etiquette here. Do we call it Watergate 2.0 or Comeygate.   Perhaps we should go with Trumpgate.. covers all eventualities.
862384607240613888 2017-05-10 19:11:27 UTC <robsmith286> @MikeLevinCA He probably said 'No to Trump.
862126015325384706 2017-05-09 02:03:54 UTC <robsmith286> I look forward to watching "All the President's Alt-facts"
862121439570395140 2017-05-09 01:45:43 UTC <robsmith286> For the writers of shows like VEEP and Designated Survivor, worried their scripts are beyond the realms of belief, along comes #comeyfired
862019584441950208 2017-05-09 19:00:59 UTC <robsmith286> @Baddiel If it had been a dairy farm she could also have worked in 'strong' cheese
861332149290586113 2017-05-07 21:29:21 UTC <robsmith286> @EmmanuelMacron Flicitations monsieur Lecron! Tout ce que vous pouvez faire pour aider  inverser Brexit serait trs apprci
861329088883159043 2017-05-07 21:17:12 UTC <robsmith286> @afneil Interesting. I'm way over 39 but wouldn't be able to run a country. Does age (beyond a certain point) have an serious relevance in ability?
861006848446664704 2017-05-06 23:56:44 UTC <robsmith286> @HBO @OfficialJLD @VeepHBO @stephenfry Oh, and my favourite ever Dylan gig was at Wembley in mid-80s supported by Tom Petty and band. You can see parts of it on Hard to Handle
861003519427477504 2017-05-06 23:43:30 UTC <robsmith286> @daraobriain @missdoyle2u Thank you. Helps to make some sense of my own troubles. All the best.
861001680023846914 2017-05-06 23:36:11 UTC <robsmith286> @HBO @OfficialJLD @VeepHBO @stephenfry Indeed sir. No other way to live a decent life. And on your blasphemy troubles - a trophy to put on the wall, is it not? Best.
859909425691324419 2017-05-03 23:15:58 UTC <robsmith286> 'Mrs May called the bluff of our Brussels Plotters'. Yes let's invoke anti-EU rhetoric for the betterment of the Tories. Daily Mail headlinehttps://twitter.com/MsHelicat/status/859883277238362112
859906736509124608 2017-05-03 23:05:16 UTC <robsmith286> Sean. A fence is wt you put up to separate your garden from the neighbors. A wall is something else. Costs a lot more. Your boss can afford?https://twitter.com/guardiannews/status/859891601455304708
859905722775199744 2017-05-03 23:01:15 UTC <robsmith286> Sean Spicer clashes with press over definition of a wallhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/03/sean-spicer-border-wall-fence?CMP=share_btn_tw
859902463847038977 2017-05-03 22:48:18 UTC <robsmith286> The referndum vote was YES or NO. Can somebody please tell me what we gain out of leaving. At the moment, we seem to be -100bn EUR
859901243216539650 2017-05-03 22:43:27 UTC <robsmith286> May is playing the Brexit card, which is predictable. Labour has no response, but the LibDems do. Is Junker favouring the Tories?https://twitter.com/timfarron/status/859831361024270340
859896269535367168 2017-05-03 22:23:41 UTC <robsmith286> Geez, even the empty chair will be stressing 'strong and stable'... blah blah blahhttps://twitter.com/DanielJHannan/status/859780906034364416
859894937558667264 2017-05-03 22:18:23 UTC <robsmith286> Can I vote for Emmanuel Macron in the UK elections?
859892464773193730 2017-05-03 22:08:34 UTC <robsmith286> Bored of the political shenanigans. I voted remain in the referendum.  I'll vote for LibDem regardless of how my vote counts in the region
859391940005154818 2017-05-02 12:59:39 UTC <robsmith286> @simonmayo Great tune, great band. Also check out 'Eyes to the Wind' from their Lost in the Dream album
774023791261339649 2016-09-08 23:17:07 UTC <robsmith286> Anybody else into The Felice Brothers? Listen to Cherry Licorice on their 2014 album Favorite Waitress. My favorite song from a great album
