800882570514825216 2016-11-21 02:04:19 UTC <hernameisjacks> If there's a god forbidding me, then I profess atheism.

800208186154352640 2016-11-19 05:24:33 UTC <hernameisjacks> Oh how I've changed. I got Neck Deep on "Which pop-punk band are you?" on Qzzr. What about you? http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/quiz_which_pop_punk_band_are_you #quizzes via @Qzzr_
800161576808550400 2016-11-19 02:19:20 UTC <hernameisjacks> Thing that makes me love my job #1: Drinking hot cocoa with Juliet in the cooler while stocking
799787285000687616 2016-11-18 01:32:02 UTC <hernameisjacks> Today has literally made no sense whatsoever but I'm okay with it
799762662531985408 2016-11-18 23:54:12 UTC <hernameisjacks> I read something in @RookieMag once about finding inspiration in everything and I can honestly say I'm a much happier person since.

799392582245695488 2016-11-17 23:23:38 UTC <hernameisjacks> I'm glad the hypocrite next to me had the audacity to try and make herself look like a feminist. She's about to catch these hands.
797888520433987584 2016-11-13 19:47:01 UTC <hernameisjacks> THANK YOU TO ALL THE LOVELY PEOPLE AT SNOWED IN LAST NIGHT WHO MADE ME SO HAPPY. YOU'RE ALL SO SO LOVELY.

797247539972108293 2016-11-11 01:20:00 UTC <hernameisjacks> @MrLamphear I feel like his statement that the background is extremely important could also apply heavily to "Apocalypse Now"
797245311643254788 2016-11-11 01:11:09 UTC <hernameisjacks> @esqonfire @E_boseuui_yeoja I understand, but that does not mean he deserves my respect.
796842990404767744 2016-11-10 22:32:28 UTC <hernameisjacks> I hope I made a good impression. I want him to know I'm what's best for him.
796326106534215681 2016-11-09 12:18:33 UTC <hernameisjacks> He isn't my president
796166864292429824 2016-11-08 01:45:47 UTC <hernameisjacks> If Donald Trump wins I will cease to believe there is a god
796078903886573572 2016-11-08 19:56:15 UTC <hernameisjacks> As if I couldn't hate my grandmother more, she goes and votes for trump. Smh.

794323880919891968 2016-11-03 23:42:25 UTC <hernameisjacks> @esqonfire as a woman, what future is trump promising you? And what compels you to vote for him?
794319934054690816 2016-11-03 23:26:44 UTC <hernameisjacks> I'm thankful that @CirceKleck went out to lunch with me and listened to my annoying rants
793456394657759232 2016-11-01 14:15:20 UTC <hernameisjacks> I'm thankful for the sucker that my friend gave me this morning because I got super sad then found it in my pocket and smiled.
793217810331729925 2016-10-31 22:27:17 UTC <hernameisjacks> Maybe I was too honest, but that does not mean I get persecuted for something you refuse to believe.
793217653112471552 2016-10-31 22:26:40 UTC <hernameisjacks> I don't lie, but think of me what you wish. I know who I am and what happened, so your opinions don't bother me the way they did.
793210123154026496 2016-10-31 21:56:45 UTC <hernameisjacks> If I've learned anything from today's events, it's that there's good people in bad places. Dammit, there are saints

790363429387243520 2016-10-23 01:25:00 UTC <hernameisjacks> I don't know, maybe it's a coincidence, but it still seems pretty spooky and well thought out.
789885969197588480 2016-10-22 17:47:45 UTC <hernameisjacks> If you have a chance, go see the LHS Barnstormers' production of Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing." It was seriously phenomenal.

788512255948324865 2016-10-18 22:49:06 UTC <hernameisjacks> My friend has more confidence in me than I had in myself, and for that I am forever grateful. She showed me that I deserve better.
787826688533139456 2016-10-16 01:24:54 UTC <hernameisjacks> I just watched "The Nightmare" on Netflix and I'm going to have nightmares for the next 47 years. I'm impressed. @Rodney_Ascher
737634216058466304 2016-05-31 13:17:56 UTC <hernameisjacks> There is nothing wrong with saying no even if you're in a trusting relationship. I'm not difficult. I'm just not ready to do things.
