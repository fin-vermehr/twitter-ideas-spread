955557801698340865 2018-01-22 21:48:27 UTC <_SPortz> @MuslimIQ 3/3 I believe that is the only way for divergent groups to find their way to each other. Don't invalidate. Don't get angry or shutdown. Just listen. Consider. Instead of "I know," say, "I wonder?"
955557465604571136 2018-01-22 21:47:07 UTC <_SPortz> @MuslimIQ That, as a woman, is what I want from men. Being able to describe my experience as a woman to a man w/o him feeling accused or attacked is so valuable. 2/3
955557205742202880 2018-01-22 21:46:05 UTC <_SPortz> @MuslimIQ As a pale person, I think that the best thing I can do is to listen with an open mind, without guilt or defensiveness. Just plain listen. Consider. Don't have an answer.

879553510521675776 2017-06-26 04:14:32 UTC <_SPortz> @MuslimIQ I just can't even. Sometimes one runs out of WTF's.
879552676249427968 2017-06-26 04:11:13 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi @Writerinlaw I seriously had NO idea. No one I know will own up but clearly I need to get out more!
879494904866627584 2017-06-26 00:21:40 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi @melellisdvm Hahahaha.....that is SO Slytherin!
879493621921271809 2017-06-26 00:16:34 UTC <_SPortz> @MikeHudema God, I love Canada.
879492399256489984 2017-06-26 00:11:42 UTC <_SPortz> @CBC That's just sick.

879490909670387716 2017-06-26 00:05:47 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi I like how NO one ever admits to being Slytherin.
879490232772591616 2017-06-26 00:03:06 UTC <_SPortz> @jk_rowling Thank you! You made my world a richer place.
879489981504528384 2017-06-26 00:02:06 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi Just having this discussion earlier. Canadians are definitely Hufflepuffs.
878924721080987648 2017-06-25 10:35:57 UTC <_SPortz> @PollySamson I ADORE Roger Allam....first fell in love with his voice in radio program "Cabin Pressure."
878828533396758528 2017-06-24 04:13:44 UTC <_SPortz> @KeithOlbermann Bring me a shrubbery! A nice one, not too expensive!
878828304748425220 2017-06-24 04:12:50 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Right now I am in Montral and am so agog at the meeting of ALL THESE cultural backgrounds. This is a good thing, people!
878828004776005634 2017-06-24 04:11:38 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 'Zactly. And it makes the world a lousier place to live. I don't want to live in a society where everyone is just like me. How boring!
878826876961259520 2017-06-24 04:07:09 UTC <_SPortz> @CBCNews @Debalap No kidding. That photo is the worst.
878826445925220353 2017-06-24 04:05:27 UTC <_SPortz> @22_Minutes Stop making me cry!
878826199228833792 2017-06-24 04:04:28 UTC <_SPortz> It's part of growing up Canadian.https://twitter.com/22_Minutes/status/878754641852456960
878825280491618308 2017-06-24 04:00:49 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Me too. Okay, I'm not a guy but...I AM affected by oppression even when I, personally, am not being oppressed. It damages our society.
878824900017999872 2017-06-24 03:59:18 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 @DaphneDoGood1 Say.....are you me? 'Cause you sure sound a lot like me. :)

878416679574831104 2017-06-23 00:57:11 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 To say nothing of 45 minutes straight flossing. It's the dental equivalent of cramming for an exam.

876140519063076864 2017-06-17 18:12:32 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 What you said. AND! Paramount importance: a sense of humour and a keen appreciation of the absurd.
875788118670024704 2017-06-16 18:52:13 UTC <_SPortz> @Scott_Gilmore Sheeeeeesh. Has it only been 146 days? It seems like ten years.
875769374069497856 2017-06-16 17:37:44 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh It's a beauty that ya are, young lassie! Have the best of times....
875270016710492160 2017-06-15 08:33:28 UTC <_SPortz> The myth of a high tax rate undermines our ability to invest in public services. So let's clear the air http://www.taxfreedom.ca
875227925972254722 2017-06-14 05:46:13 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 But of course! Kind of like it's 2017 and I still love Shakespeare, Gershwin and Van Gogh. Some art transcends time.
875227569888518145 2017-06-14 05:44:48 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Cheeky!

875068386753085440 2017-06-14 19:12:16 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Ohhhh, NOW I get it. You're one of those evil genius types, like Lex Luthor!

872660496133963776 2017-06-07 03:44:10 UTC <_SPortz> @CBCMusic @CBC @SabbySamuel Oh, I beg your pardon; I had no idea that Diana Krall had done a cover. I'll have a listen; Krall does everything SO well.
872512929794465792 2017-06-07 17:57:47 UTC <_SPortz> @burnaby1953 This is a satire site, right? Comedy? Surely you jest?
872512785166458880 2017-06-07 17:57:13 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh On my way there is <2 weeks! Wahoo!
872512302334922752 2017-06-07 17:55:18 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh Ack! 
872511949388472320 2017-06-07 17:53:53 UTC <_SPortz> @CBCMusic @CBC @SabbySamuel Um....."A Case of You" is by Joni Mitchell.
872511740520480768 2017-06-07 17:53:04 UTC <_SPortz> @CBCMusic @CBC Canadian Railroad Trilogy. Nothing says "Canada" so much (although Northwest Passage is a close second).
872337462198251520 2017-06-06 06:20:32 UTC <_SPortz> @MYSADCAT @cox_tom Saaaaaaay....that looks JUST like the moon here in Canada! 
872239231241863168 2017-06-06 23:50:12 UTC <_SPortz> @22_Minutes @Trent_McClellan @markcritch Makes sense. All the funniest people in Canada are from the Rock. The rest of us await our next delivery of hilarity. Go!
872238916560011265 2017-06-06 23:48:57 UTC <_SPortz> @JSCarroll @neilhimself Oh, gently tap-dancing Jesus. That is first-rate CREEPY.
872238613945122816 2017-06-06 23:47:45 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi I hear you. Anything not sweet and throw it over ice. I'm ready.
872237995671248896 2017-06-06 23:45:18 UTC <_SPortz> @JustinTrudeau @dave_lauck We are ALL a part of a global community. What is within our choice is how we choose to deal with that fact.
872237860799172608 2017-06-06 23:44:46 UTC <_SPortz> @JustinTrudeau @dave_lauck That's pretty much impossible. It's kind of like the brain saying it doesn't want to be part of the body anymore.
872236753242865664 2017-06-06 23:40:22 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh No f***ing way is that butter. On the other hand:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MsbvGmLaU4
871912693120237568 2017-06-05 02:12:40 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi The smart dudes are the ones laughing up their sleeves at all the so-called "alpha" posturing. That's where the party is!
871912502027845633 2017-06-05 02:11:54 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi "Alpha" crap is the sociological equivalent of healing with crystals. Also an excuse to act like an asshole.
871911954897653760 2017-06-05 02:09:44 UTC <_SPortz> @RosieBarton Yeeeeeesh. Make sure to make an appt with your dentist at least so all that sugar doesn't cause any permanent damage. 
871909343314182146 2017-06-05 01:59:21 UTC <_SPortz> Just in case we Canadians start feeling a bit smug.....racism is EVERYWHERE. Stand up. Speak out.http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/go-back-to-china-outrage-over-racist-rant-caught-on-video-1.3443983
871788878109302784 2017-06-05 18:00:40 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 I know. I struggle not to wiggle, hug myself and give a little chortle of joy. :)
871523564653912064 2017-06-04 00:26:24 UTC <_SPortz> @allanhawco It's bewildering. You were just standing there, minding your own business when.... I don't get it either!
871523427336699904 2017-06-04 00:25:51 UTC <_SPortz> @RosieBarton Double dog dare?? Uh-oh. Gloves are off now.
871424991920758785 2017-06-04 17:54:43 UTC <_SPortz> No shit. The stench of arrogance is absolutely overpowering.https://twitter.com/danielleiat/status/871383803939258369
871424715788660736 2017-06-04 17:53:37 UTC <_SPortz> @ChrChristensen @WoodCarma @OGalanter @SherCerLub Then Trump is most certainly not successful.
871424541943144448 2017-06-04 17:52:55 UTC <_SPortz> @ChrChristensen @WoodCarma @OGalanter @SherCerLub If one's definition of success includes things like loving family and friends, service to one's community, self-management, dependability..
871424312506368001 2017-06-04 17:52:01 UTC <_SPortz> @ChrChristensen @WoodCarma @OGalanter @SherCerLub If you define success only in terms of money, perhaps. He certainly is not a self-made billionaire, as his father staked him to start.
871421880321794050 2017-06-04 17:42:21 UTC <_SPortz> Carry on, @neilhimself, carry on. From Canada, massive respect for the outstanding resilience of the British people.https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/871289044331835393
871421543808512001 2017-06-04 17:41:00 UTC <_SPortz> @jk_rowling Obviously some journalist knows nothing of the UK people. He/she needs to take a few history lessons.
871421112629907457 2017-06-04 17:39:18 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Again with the monitor wiping - OMG, I LOVE that shirt.
871231907387777024 2017-06-03 05:07:28 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh Thank you! I needed this right now (heading there shortly).
870939998232526848 2017-06-03 09:47:31 UTC <_SPortz> @PollySamson "The time has come," the Walrus said....
870939336098709504 2017-06-03 09:44:53 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi Bwahahahahaha! It's a conspiracy to cast you in the light of some 70s jerk!
870938433618796545 2017-06-03 09:41:18 UTC <_SPortz> @RockNRollPics Ohhhhhh, wow.....WHAT a photo!!
870938019175448576 2017-06-03 09:39:39 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Festivus for the rest of us! Happy Cofefe.
870937897142071296 2017-06-03 09:39:10 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 I am INTO opening doors for people. This MAY have something to do with being Canadian. It's a weird tic with us.
870937613686890498 2017-06-03 09:38:02 UTC <_SPortz> @HayesBrown I'm so confused.
870451730558754817 2017-06-01 01:27:19 UTC <_SPortz> @MuslimIQ Can Canadians retweet as well? We've got a lot of silly people up here too.
870451432482258944 2017-06-01 01:26:08 UTC <_SPortz> @PaulGross_ @allanhawco Consider EVERYONE told.

870138922524749824 2017-05-31 04:44:20 UTC <_SPortz> @newcivilrights Well, she's basically an idiot so no great loss.
870138749606256640 2017-05-31 04:43:38 UTC <_SPortz> @JoeLATrib True that. She was so annoying that the funny got lost in the curling lip of biting irritation.
870137651763884032 2017-05-31 04:39:17 UTC <_SPortz> It had to be sung.https://twitter.com/HayesBrown/status/870120031945986048
870137434876465152 2017-05-31 04:38:25 UTC <_SPortz> @lesliedw11 @HillaryClinton OMG. If I didn't already have great respect for you, this would have won me over. Hillary, Warrior Queen!
870136923511062528 2017-05-31 04:36:23 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Never a truer word spoken. Those who can, do. Those who can't just cast about wildly and sink to shock schlock in desperation.
870069084859244544 2017-05-31 00:06:49 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh Especially when combined with a well-poured Guinness.
870068993058521088 2017-05-31 00:06:27 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh When emotional, apply cheese directly to the injured area. Repeat the treatment until pangs of emotion lessen. It's always worked for me!
869722722502230016 2017-05-30 01:10:30 UTC <_SPortz> @kevinolearytv @canadiancynic @TorontoStar Yes. Go, Kevin. You know you feel much more at home in the States anyway.
869695154193440768 2017-05-30 23:20:57 UTC <_SPortz> @CBCAlerts WHAT a dickhead. She should have smacked him a good one.

869692878770929665 2017-05-30 23:11:55 UTC <_SPortz> @newcivilrights Kathy Griffin is a bit of a wanker, to be honest.
869691931491573760 2017-05-30 23:08:09 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Oh, no. I'm afraid to find out.
869691276886556672 2017-05-30 23:05:33 UTC <_SPortz> @macleans OR maybe they should acknowledge that it's TOO CROWDED, for crying out loud! Be humane - take out ONE row of seats!

869688751752073216 2017-05-30 22:55:31 UTC <_SPortz> @macleans @burnaby1953 It's true. We're witnessing the downfall of the American Empire.
869688483513720832 2017-05-30 22:54:27 UTC <_SPortz> @JustinTrudeau I am SO proud of the global representation of our country in your hands - gracious, mature, open-minded. Merci beaucoup!

834818384755765248 2017-02-23 17:33:07 UTC <_SPortz> SECOND: 2. Trudeau should not have promised. But when he broke that promise, he owned it. Didn't slough responsibility.
834818179541012480 2017-02-23 17:32:18 UTC <_SPortz> My final thoughts on election reform: 1. I'm guessing over half of Canadians aren't clear on how it works now and fewer still the options.

790306754458292224 2016-10-23 21:39:48 UTC <_SPortz> @checkupcbc I think art can sneak past the resistance people have to looking at the truth; that is art's wonderful subversiveness! Trickster

790305222824382465 2016-10-23 21:33:42 UTC <_SPortz> @checkupcbc I think including FN history in school is a great step toward reconciliation. Hopefully will lessen future generation's racism.
790304986949312512 2016-10-23 21:32:46 UTC <_SPortz> @checkupcbc Ry Moran really spoke to me when he said that reconciliation is not likely to be complete until all parties UNDERSTAND the past.

790298537992990720 2016-10-23 21:07:09 UTC <_SPortz> @checkupcbc Excellent point by Brian Moran (sp?); perhaps we need to pause on reconciliation and move toward widespread education first.

955557465604571136 2018-01-22 21:47:07 UTC <_SPortz> @MuslimIQ That, as a woman, is what I want from men. Being able to describe my experience as a woman to a man w/o him feeling accused or attacked is so valuable. 2/3

947056286931107841 2017-12-30 10:46:28 UTC <_SPortz> @CBC The right music!
945848211813494785 2017-12-26 02:46:01 UTC <_SPortz> @DevonESawa It was a great show....snappy, witty dialogue in the spirit of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell.
945791886253420545 2017-12-26 23:02:12 UTC <_SPortz> @MyRockMixtapes @GilmourOrgasm @JohnFlanagan72 No, he did a couple of shots for Ossie Clark in London but, according to him, it's been blown way out of proportion - it was one or two occasions. Mainly 'cause he was starving.
945791411454033920 2017-12-26 23:00:19 UTC <_SPortz> @jk_rowling Alan Rickman only needed to stand around and look into the camera. He was just mesmerizing.
945789978310729728 2017-12-26 22:54:37 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh Oh, sweet jesus. That was a total butt clencher. I'm feeling shaky just contemplating it. ::::silent screaming::::

945789342491877376 2017-12-26 22:52:05 UTC <_SPortz> @markcritch So very sorry for your loss, Mark. Any mother that could bring up a son like you must have been a wonderful woman. I wish you peace.
943746683757772800 2017-12-20 07:35:18 UTC <_SPortz> @_DavidGilmour @GilmourOrgasm On his return to Pompeii. Pretty cute that David was shirtless first time around and son Gabriel is shirtless second time around. :)

875769374069497856 2017-06-16 17:37:44 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh It's a beauty that ya are, young lassie! Have the best of times....
875270016710492160 2017-06-15 08:33:28 UTC <_SPortz> The myth of a high tax rate undermines our ability to invest in public services. So let's clear the air http://www.taxfreedom.ca
875227925972254722 2017-06-14 05:46:13 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 But of course! Kind of like it's 2017 and I still love Shakespeare, Gershwin and Van Gogh. Some art transcends time.

872511949388472320 2017-06-07 17:53:53 UTC <_SPortz> @CBCMusic @CBC @SabbySamuel Um....."A Case of You" is by Joni Mitchell.
872511740520480768 2017-06-07 17:53:04 UTC <_SPortz> @CBCMusic @CBC Canadian Railroad Trilogy. Nothing says "Canada" so much (although Northwest Passage is a close second).

872239231241863168 2017-06-06 23:50:12 UTC <_SPortz> @22_Minutes @Trent_McClellan @markcritch Makes sense. All the funniest people in Canada are from the Rock. The rest of us await our next delivery of hilarity. Go!

872238613945122816 2017-06-06 23:47:45 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi I hear you. Anything not sweet and throw it over ice. I'm ready.
872237995671248896 2017-06-06 23:45:18 UTC <_SPortz> @JustinTrudeau @dave_lauck We are ALL a part of a global community. What is within our choice is how we choose to deal with that fact.
872237860799172608 2017-06-06 23:44:46 UTC <_SPortz> @JustinTrudeau @dave_lauck That's pretty much impossible. It's kind of like the brain saying it doesn't want to be part of the body anymore.
872236753242865664 2017-06-06 23:40:22 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh No f***ing way is that butter. On the other hand:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MsbvGmLaU4
871912693120237568 2017-06-05 02:12:40 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi The smart dudes are the ones laughing up their sleeves at all the so-called "alpha" posturing. That's where the party is!
871912502027845633 2017-06-05 02:11:54 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi "Alpha" crap is the sociological equivalent of healing with crystals. Also an excuse to act like an asshole.
871911954897653760 2017-06-05 02:09:44 UTC <_SPortz> @RosieBarton Yeeeeeesh. Make sure to make an appt with your dentist at least so all that sugar doesn't cause any permanent damage. 
871909343314182146 2017-06-05 01:59:21 UTC <_SPortz> Just in case we Canadians start feeling a bit smug.....racism is EVERYWHERE. Stand up. Speak out.http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/go-back-to-china-outrage-over-racist-rant-caught-on-video-1.3443983
871788878109302784 2017-06-05 18:00:40 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 I know. I struggle not to wiggle, hug myself and give a little chortle of joy. :)
871523564653912064 2017-06-04 00:26:24 UTC <_SPortz> @allanhawco It's bewildering. You were just standing there, minding your own business when.... I don't get it either!
871523427336699904 2017-06-04 00:25:51 UTC <_SPortz> @RosieBarton Double dog dare?? Uh-oh. Gloves are off now.
871424991920758785 2017-06-04 17:54:43 UTC <_SPortz> No shit. The stench of arrogance is absolutely overpowering.https://twitter.com/danielleiat/status/871383803939258369
871424715788660736 2017-06-04 17:53:37 UTC <_SPortz> @ChrChristensen @WoodCarma @OGalanter @SherCerLub Then Trump is most certainly not successful.
871424541943144448 2017-06-04 17:52:55 UTC <_SPortz> @ChrChristensen @WoodCarma @OGalanter @SherCerLub If one's definition of success includes things like loving family and friends, service to one's community, self-management, dependability..
871424312506368001 2017-06-04 17:52:01 UTC <_SPortz> @ChrChristensen @WoodCarma @OGalanter @SherCerLub If you define success only in terms of money, perhaps. He certainly is not a self-made billionaire, as his father staked him to start.
871421880321794050 2017-06-04 17:42:21 UTC <_SPortz> Carry on, @neilhimself, carry on. From Canada, massive respect for the outstanding resilience of the British people.https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/871289044331835393
871421543808512001 2017-06-04 17:41:00 UTC <_SPortz> @jk_rowling Obviously some journalist knows nothing of the UK people. He/she needs to take a few history lessons.
871421112629907457 2017-06-04 17:39:18 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Again with the monitor wiping - OMG, I LOVE that shirt.
871231907387777024 2017-06-03 05:07:28 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh Thank you! I needed this right now (heading there shortly).
870939998232526848 2017-06-03 09:47:31 UTC <_SPortz> @PollySamson "The time has come," the Walrus said....
870939336098709504 2017-06-03 09:44:53 UTC <_SPortz> @scalzi Bwahahahahaha! It's a conspiracy to cast you in the light of some 70s jerk!
870938433618796545 2017-06-03 09:41:18 UTC <_SPortz> @RockNRollPics Ohhhhhh, wow.....WHAT a photo!!
870938019175448576 2017-06-03 09:39:39 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Festivus for the rest of us! Happy Cofefe.
870937897142071296 2017-06-03 09:39:10 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 I am INTO opening doors for people. This MAY have something to do with being Canadian. It's a weird tic with us.
870937613686890498 2017-06-03 09:38:02 UTC <_SPortz> @HayesBrown I'm so confused.
870451730558754817 2017-06-01 01:27:19 UTC <_SPortz> @MuslimIQ Can Canadians retweet as well? We've got a lot of silly people up here too.
870451432482258944 2017-06-01 01:26:08 UTC <_SPortz> @PaulGross_ @allanhawco Consider EVERYONE told.
870143811627790338 2017-05-31 05:03:45 UTC <_SPortz> @JenBaresAll @MuslimIQ Oh, I didn't know that - no water either!
870138922524749824 2017-05-31 04:44:20 UTC <_SPortz> @newcivilrights Well, she's basically an idiot so no great loss.
870138749606256640 2017-05-31 04:43:38 UTC <_SPortz> @JoeLATrib True that. She was so annoying that the funny got lost in the curling lip of biting irritation.
870137651763884032 2017-05-31 04:39:17 UTC <_SPortz> It had to be sung.https://twitter.com/HayesBrown/status/870120031945986048
870137434876465152 2017-05-31 04:38:25 UTC <_SPortz> @lesliedw11 @HillaryClinton OMG. If I didn't already have great respect for you, this would have won me over. Hillary, Warrior Queen!
870136923511062528 2017-05-31 04:36:23 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Never a truer word spoken. Those who can, do. Those who can't just cast about wildly and sink to shock schlock in desperation.
870069084859244544 2017-05-31 00:06:49 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh Especially when combined with a well-poured Guinness.
870068993058521088 2017-05-31 00:06:27 UTC <_SPortz> @candicewalsh When emotional, apply cheese directly to the injured area. Repeat the treatment until pangs of emotion lessen. It's always worked for me!
869722722502230016 2017-05-30 01:10:30 UTC <_SPortz> @kevinolearytv @canadiancynic @TorontoStar Yes. Go, Kevin. You know you feel much more at home in the States anyway.
869695154193440768 2017-05-30 23:20:57 UTC <_SPortz> @CBCAlerts WHAT a dickhead. She should have smacked him a good one.
869694241957478400 2017-05-30 23:17:20 UTC <_SPortz> @VisitBritain And people say the British are emotionally cold....C'mon over here, Britain, and give me a cwtch, you devilishly sexy brute, you.
869693320565358592 2017-05-30 23:13:40 UTC <_SPortz> @TheRBuckle @stratfest @ByKennethJones I got the horse right here, his name is Paul Revere!
869692878770929665 2017-05-30 23:11:55 UTC <_SPortz> @newcivilrights Kathy Griffin is a bit of a wanker, to be honest.
869691931491573760 2017-05-30 23:08:09 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Oh, no. I'm afraid to find out.
869691276886556672 2017-05-30 23:05:33 UTC <_SPortz> @macleans OR maybe they should acknowledge that it's TOO CROWDED, for crying out loud! Be humane - take out ONE row of seats!
869690780775989248 2017-05-30 23:03:34 UTC <_SPortz> @CBCTheNational I am SOOOOO thankful for @JustinTrudeau at this point - watching this trip unfold makes it obvious that we've got primo rep globally.
869690226213437440 2017-05-30 23:01:22 UTC <_SPortz> @10down @hachettehawks Lying on floor laughing. As my cat knocks stuff onto me.
869689728957677568 2017-05-30 22:59:24 UTC <_SPortz> @HayesBrown @iSmashFizzle Goldblum AND Tucci? Are you toying with me? #canthispossiblybetrue
869688751752073216 2017-05-30 22:55:31 UTC <_SPortz> @macleans @burnaby1953 It's true. We're witnessing the downfall of the American Empire.
869688483513720832 2017-05-30 22:54:27 UTC <_SPortz> @JustinTrudeau I am SO proud of the global representation of our country in your hands - gracious, mature, open-minded. Merci beaucoup!
869687809619009538 2017-05-30 22:51:46 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Whoa! Suitably impressed. Everyday ninjas walk among us!
869628507969601536 2017-05-30 18:56:07 UTC <_SPortz> @RosieBarton On the edge of my seat! (my province so doubly agog)
869628154322665472 2017-05-30 18:54:43 UTC <_SPortz> Let's do it!! Any way we can talk Obama into tweeting up a storm about the excellence of air?https://twitter.com/scalzi/status/869310396896862209
869627761710686208 2017-05-30 18:53:09 UTC <_SPortz> @jk_rowling I'm hopelessly hetero but am SO attracted to your lacerating wit. Keep 'em coming, Ms. Rowling.
869277598974529536 2017-05-29 19:41:44 UTC <_SPortz> @Zain @MuslimIQ I don't believe in "God" but I believe in love and respect. And I believe in your campaign of enlightenment and education. Well done!
869276911687483392 2017-05-29 19:39:00 UTC <_SPortz> @openculture @TheMickyDolenz1 What a mismatch!
869275761114361856 2017-05-29 19:34:26 UTC <_SPortz> @ChrisEvans TRUE! Always put the blame on the person that starts confrontation and hatred, NOT on the victim of it.
869013444355211265 2017-05-28 02:12:05 UTC <_SPortz> Oh, cruel world!! I was WAITING for them to do it!!!https://twitter.com/HayesBrown/status/868516633387642881
869011766113574912 2017-05-28 02:05:25 UTC <_SPortz> @HayesBrown @jarry Boomers can be SO hypocritical. It makes me cringe. (I'm a Boomer)
869005002823553024 2017-05-28 01:38:32 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Yikes. I never even considered the possibility. I suppose I'd have to hie me back to mass and take the host again. 
868913854301954048 2017-05-28 19:36:21 UTC <_SPortz> @ricedaddy7 Yes, but what a way to go!

834820064876466176 2017-02-23 17:39:48 UTC <_SPortz> SEVENTH: But we never, ever, ever, ever need to get ugly and vicious about it. #causewecandobetterthanthat
834819888602501120 2017-02-23 17:39:06 UTC <_SPortz> SIXTH: The present Canadian federal government is well in line with what I love & believe in about my home. I know that's not true for all.
834819382471585792 2017-02-23 17:37:05 UTC <_SPortz> FIFTH (continued) 100% ability to avoid stupid mistakes. If the humans in question are averaging 70 to 75%, I think that's reasonable.
834819073053581316 2017-02-23 17:35:51 UTC <_SPortz> FIFTH: (sort of further to fourth!) I don't expect 100% satisfaction from anything involving humans. Not even 100% truth, transparency or..
834818769016926208 2017-02-23 17:34:39 UTC <_SPortz> FOURTH (in a series!!). 4. Election reform is not high enough on my own personal priorities to throw 'em under the bus.
834818574610882560 2017-02-23 17:33:53 UTC <_SPortz> THIRD: 3. The Conservatives sure as hell will never bring about election reform.
834818384755765248 2017-02-23 17:33:07 UTC <_SPortz> SECOND: 2. Trudeau should not have promised. But when he broke that promise, he owned it. Didn't slough responsibility.
834818179541012480 2017-02-23 17:32:18 UTC <_SPortz> My final thoughts on election reform: 1. I'm guessing over half of Canadians aren't clear on how it works now and fewer still the options.
