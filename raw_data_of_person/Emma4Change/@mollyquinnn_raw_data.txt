768302013721382913 2016-08-23 04:20:49 UTC <mollyquinnn> My mom purposely uses a trans person's dead pronouns or calls them "it". Then gets mad at me for calling her out. 
768206430180552704 2016-08-23 22:01:00 UTC <mollyquinnn> 7) Talk less, smile more. Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for.

768185248509157376 2016-08-23 20:36:50 UTC <mollyquinnn> 6) Talk to new people, you never know if they are a possible friend/relationship.
768184728142827520 2016-08-23 20:34:46 UTC <mollyquinnn> 4) You won't graduate high school with the same squad you started with.
768184405030350848 2016-08-23 20:33:28 UTC <mollyquinnn> 3) If an upperclassmen guy snapchats you really late at night to hang out, he really likes your personality.
768184007364186113 2016-08-23 20:31:54 UTC <mollyquinnn> 2) Do not be disrespectful, it's not cool & it's not funny.

765491102983925760 2016-08-16 10:11:15 UTC <mollyquinnn> She depressed in the tweets but a freak in the sheets   
765475947730444288 2016-08-16 09:11:02 UTC <mollyquinnn> when something cool happens but you don't want to get too excited just in case it doesn't work out 
765326892954116096 2016-08-15 23:18:45 UTC <mollyquinnn> @CrownTheEmpire I'm sad that you guys aren't coming anywhere close to Washington, like usual

763203879861231616 2016-08-09 02:42:39 UTC <mollyquinnn> My friend uses Facebook messenger to contact her mom & couldn't when she had to go to the hospital once.
763203230222254081 2016-08-09 02:40:04 UTC <mollyquinnn> If you have an example of an emergency where you needed the wifi, please message me. This is unfair and particularly unsafe.
763202486802853888 2016-08-09 02:37:07 UTC <mollyquinnn> This is unsafe because what if they are in trouble and they are unable to reach their mother or father because the wifi isn't available?
763202329466155008 2016-08-09 02:36:29 UTC <mollyquinnn> All, it's also unsafe. Some people can't afford data and only use Facebook messenger or snapchat to communicate with family members/ friends
763202125878796289 2016-08-09 02:35:41 UTC <mollyquinnn> We need to stand up against Tumwater taking the wifi away. Not only is it unfair that the few who abused it should get it taken away for -
