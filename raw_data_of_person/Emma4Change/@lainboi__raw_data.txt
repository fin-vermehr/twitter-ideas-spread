967400762899869696 2018-02-24 14:08:09 UTC <lainboi_> @BuckleUrPants @otter_poppin I figured... America is weird and backwards from the rest of the world rip
967220905448525824 2018-02-23 02:13:28 UTC <lainboi_> @BuckleUrPants waIT Im confused do people in eu put the dates backwards bc to me this looks like January third but it probably means March first ahhHHHH
965027167062110210 2018-02-17 00:56:20 UTC <lainboi_> @matthewmercer YOUR VOICE IS IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY FAVORITE VIDEO GAMES (and a few of my favorite characters!) why are you like this, so wonderful
964182378267795456 2018-02-15 16:59:27 UTC <lainboi_> @heyimnotkatie @Leopardus_emma @Faticatipeter the point has gone directly over your head & I dont want to talk about it anymore. 17 people died the other day. and unfortunately people have to be scared if theyre next.
964181481911472129 2018-02-15 16:55:53 UTC <lainboi_> @heyimnotkatie @Leopardus_emma @Faticatipeter Im fully aware but its possible because of family members uselessly owning guns. its where the problem for teens getting guns begins.
964180209468628994 2018-02-15 16:50:50 UTC <lainboi_> @heyimnotkatie @Faticatipeter @Leopardus_emma I just ignored the tweet assuming they were being sarcastic \_()_/ and if I, a mentally unstable 16 year old, could get a hold of a gun, and Im sure I could, wed really be screwed because other people like me could get one 
963968677858152448 2018-02-14 02:50:17 UTC <lainboi_> @heyimnotkatie tfw I live in the US and I dont at all feel safe leaving my house because everyone in my area owns guns \_()_/
963217745549537281 2018-02-12 01:06:20 UTC <lainboi_> @FlatEarthOrg okay so Ive come to the conclusion that the Flat Earth Society is one big joke. theres no way it isnt. people dont seriously believe that the earth is flat, right? saying the earth is flat is like saying ah, theres a big invisible alien spaceship above us!
963124658328436737 2018-02-12 18:56:27 UTC <lainboi_> @FlatEarthOrg you... you guys are joking, right? theres absolutely no way I could take you seriously...
962234699849584640 2018-02-10 08:00:04 UTC <lainboi_> @AeroViro hi um why does Ryuji remind me of beast boy from teen titans?pic.twitter.com/DBkqHFizuJ
962012373300031489 2018-02-09 17:16:37 UTC <lainboi_> @Snapchat I hate the layout of Snapchat now I hate it I hate it I hate it please change it BACK AHHHH
961048589584797702 2018-02-06 01:26:53 UTC <lainboi_> @AeroViro so Im watching your p5 play through... I wont be sleeping for the next 91 hours :)
960692614252171266 2018-02-05 01:52:22 UTC <lainboi_> @hollyhollywood yep! It was a few days ago so I got it working again! thank you though!
959803711110504448 2018-02-03 15:00:11 UTC <lainboi_> @OW_Pachimari it happens at random & has nothing to do with their consoles, I know one got the blurry screen from opening the menu & had to dc to fix it, another picked a hero & just dropped out, and another had a black screen & couldnt see anything & had to dc :/ ty for the help though :)
959633775863980032 2018-02-02 03:44:55 UTC <lainboi_> @BlizzardCS hi! my friends keep disconnecting and losing sr! on PS4! please fix, I havent fixed my forums battle net account yet to report the bug \_()_/
959143017067278337 2018-02-01 19:14:49 UTC <lainboi_> @WyomingMyst Ill try both if one doesnt work. thank you for the help!
959142335849336832 2018-02-01 19:12:07 UTC <lainboi_> @WyomingMyst I did, if you have to do it from the console. I can login via pc and view my PS4 stats from my battle net profile & it says its linked, I think the problem was what blizz said it was, Ive never really messed with the controls :)
959141798634491904 2018-02-01 19:09:59 UTC <lainboi_> @BlizzardCS Ill try it! thank you for the quick reply! :)
959138604357386240 2018-02-01 18:57:17 UTC <lainboi_> @BlizzardCS hello, I just tried to use the Overwatch blizzard forums (for the first time) and it says my ability to post is disabled. my question is: what in tarnation?
959138053129474054 2018-02-01 18:55:06 UTC <lainboi_> @erdmozkan @unitlostgaming my friend the other night had this issue too when he went to give Mei a crosshair & he ended up disconnecting (in comp)
958875888153780224 2018-01-31 01:33:21 UTC <lainboi_> Honestly Mercy is 100% still playable at all ranks but she isnt super necessary now. it feels good to be able to play Zenyatta and Lucio more but also still be able to play Mercy! #overwatch #mercy #mercynerf
958860443006787584 2018-01-31 00:31:59 UTC <lainboi_> @LieutenantEddy as a Mercy main tbh I agree. still got to masters for the first time with nerfed Mercy! got to play a little Zen as well... feels refreshing tbh. Id forgotten how much I actually loved all of the supports! :D
958801995523133440 2018-01-31 20:39:44 UTC <lainboi_> @BlizzardCS nevermind! I signed into another account & then back in and it opened! I was very confused lol
958801023820353536 2018-01-31 20:35:52 UTC <lainboi_> @BlizzardCS on PS4 Ive been staring at the please wait... screen for 20 minutes trying to get into Overwatch, and all psn services are up and running. has my account gotten banned? I didnt get an email & I didnt do anything to get banned...
958800516154314757 2018-01-31 20:33:51 UTC <lainboi_> @ApplyOW I just got whiplash from reading that

958498266483712001 2018-01-30 00:32:49 UTC <lainboi_> next developer update   hi this is Jeff from the Overwatch team and weve got another Mercy rework coming in where weve removed her healing caduceus and her resurrect and buffed the damage on her pistol. shes now a dps. #overwatch #ripmercy
958446694953299969 2018-01-30 21:07:53 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @Kailkun @hoboinab0x @Darkprincejonny I feel that on a very personal level xd. I started in silver & now Im like 20 sr from masters (I bought the game in season 4)
958446335564369924 2018-01-30 21:06:28 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x @Kailkun Junkrat is... hmm. hes fine/was decently fine, the only reason I hate him was because I was killed by him like 100 times in one day as soldier, and that was pre-buff. but still, hes kinda... idk. I dont play him so I shouldnt really have too big a say in that matter.
958445819790856192 2018-01-30 21:04:25 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x @Kailkun its very unfortunate, the state of which everyones mind is in related to mercy. like, sorry sty, but Mercy is important to the community & should have never been reworked.
958444857986617345 2018-01-30 21:00:35 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x @Kailkun also I blocked that hoboinabox dude because hes dumb and (based off of his twitter) sexist. just uh... keep that in mind...
958444531342626817 2018-01-30 20:59:17 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x @Kailkun not at all, I now very much dislike her kit. I want them to fix it, as does everyone else. theres no way to balance res as a second ability. reverting her is the only way.
958440271536185344 2018-01-30 20:42:22 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x @Kailkun I agree and I very much appreciate your attitude about it. after overlooking the frustration of yet another nerf I see that mercy will always be a very powerful healer, being that shes consistent, mobile, and can still res sometimes. Im not scared of losing masters! :)
958425044534939649 2018-01-30 19:41:51 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x shell always be in the meta. sucks for you, I guess. goodbye now, its probably safe for me to just block you.
958424874527182848 2018-01-30 19:41:11 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x doesnt matter, this conversation is over. Ive got no use talking to a goddamn brick wall.
958424579634094081 2018-01-30 19:40:01 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @mateboer_jan @hoboinab0x doubtful. shell probably be reworked in the future.
958424459991543808 2018-01-30 19:39:32 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x good for you. nobody cares.
958424346560811008 2018-01-30 19:39:05 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x and you have no idea how I play Mercy, you have no idea what my rank is, none of that. so how would you know that Im not a skillful Mercy player? how would you know that I cant play other heroes? your opinion is invalid, good day sir.
958423650641829888 2018-01-30 19:36:19 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x and Im pretty sure lucio requires the least amount of skill from any hero to be relatively effective.
958422883738509312 2018-01-30 19:33:16 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x a: mercy requires a different skill set from other heroes, aim doesnt equal skill.  b: I know how to play other heroes & im really good at Ana and mccree and dva, but I very much enjoy playing Mercy for her fun mobility.  c: never assume mercy mains have no skills.
958419704808398851 2018-01-30 19:20:38 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch I wish you guys wouldve taken a little more time to tweak Mercy before you took a hatchet to her already dead corpse. guess Im a lucio main now \_()_/
958418350450925568 2018-01-30 19:15:15 UTC <lainboi_> @Animetic reeeeeee guess Ill have to get masters playing lucio... dust off my ana skills.
958369038970900480 2018-01-30 15:59:19 UTC <lainboi_> @AeroViro has anyone ever told you that your laugh is incredibly contagious? its a good thing 
957759536651218944 2018-01-28 23:37:22 UTC <lainboi_> @EeveeA_ yes please
957271295250624513 2018-01-27 15:17:16 UTC <lainboi_> @Animetic question: when do you normally stream? and fantastic video, as per usual! :D
956959434831515649 2018-01-26 18:38:03 UTC <lainboi_> @AskPlayStation happens to the best of us. hope you can find the issue & squash it for a long while! :D
956548710627979264 2018-01-25 15:25:59 UTC <lainboi_> @AnneMunition @EeveeA_ @zaya_linn on smurfs, at least thats how I do it. I play near masters level on mercy on my main, then I have a smurf to play with my plat friends, and a smurf to practice dps and tank, which is in gold (but I gain like 50 sr per win and lose like 30)
956350687130079233 2018-01-24 02:19:06 UTC <lainboi_> @Co_Mill she/he (?) looks a lot like my dog Shelby!
956219474478358529 2018-01-24 17:37:43 UTC <lainboi_> @AeroViro question because im new to discord stuff: how does one join your discord server thing pls help
955925971076636673 2018-01-23 22:11:26 UTC <lainboi_> @AskPlayStation @RimmeBoltjes @kriswicks84 @Soraxel1115 @MA1NFRAM3D2 @vfl1980 Im in NC but my Minnesota friends are also having issues
955912785870905344 2018-01-23 21:19:02 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayStation @AskPlayStation rip to everyone wanting to play Overwatch with their friends from the cosmetics update on blizz world lol
955912368680263682 2018-01-23 21:17:23 UTC <lainboi_> @AskPlayStation @RimmeBoltjes @kriswicks84 @Soraxel1115 @MA1NFRAM3D2 irony at its finest ;)
955418206491021318 2018-01-22 12:33:45 UTC <lainboi_> @EeveeA_ I hella miss old mercy, and Ive enjoyed 2.0 so far but this next nerf is going to make me hate playing her :( I used to do a lot of clutch 2-mans and those big team reses were sooooo satisfying
955184363884482560 2018-01-21 21:04:33 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch cant wait for this update. also cant wait for the devs to finally revert Mercy back to 1.0 :)
954764354922131456 2018-01-20 17:15:35 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch I know its such a small detail but I miss when it was play of the match in competitive because it made it feel more special? if that makes sense?
954510704391933952 2018-01-19 00:27:40 UTC <lainboi_> @EeveeA_ I just want Mercy 1.0 back... but your idea is really cool just not something everyone would be willing to get used to. earning res would help a lot but its single target...
954137465333452801 2018-01-18 23:44:33 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch mmmmmmmmm I love it and what Id love even more... Mercy 1.0 being ... RESURRECTED
952221584135159808 2018-01-13 16:51:31 UTC <lainboi_> also keep GA the way it is now on live! it helps in survivability!
952221322284863490 2018-01-13 16:50:29 UTC <lainboi_> tbh I think blizz should just revert Mercy back to Mercy 1.0, where she can res the whole team but isnt invincible. I think wed all like that. shell never be balanced if it doesnt happen... #Overwatch
951943226960830465 2018-01-12 22:25:26 UTC <lainboi_> @LieutenantEddy why do you call yourself lieutenant?

949284572637876224 2018-01-05 14:20:53 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch what if you just slow down Valkyrie & take away the extra res charge and make valk 15 seconds. basically what you have planned but dont put a cast time on res in valk
949282672425275392 2018-01-05 14:13:20 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch I guess Im a dps main now since thats the group the devs seem to cater to \_()_/
949107586565050369 2018-01-04 02:37:36 UTC <lainboi_> @LieutenantEddy such! bullshit!

938340678689525760 2017-12-06 09:33:45 UTC <lainboi_> @AjitPaiFCC while I can still say it  youre dumb and your attempt to repeal net neutrality will not blow over lightly with the American citizens.  you claim that youre trying to restore freedom but in reality, youre trying to take it away.
930502558073880576 2017-11-14 18:27:52 UTC <lainboi_> @Animetic did you know you could use environmental objects to go higher with GA? super fun against Tracer & Winston :)

928073497879957504 2017-11-07 01:35:39 UTC <lainboi_> so Id like to give a shoutout to the @PlayOverwatch team for being awesome and always on top of things and doing all they can all the time to make the game as enjoyable as possible! I feel like they dont get enough credit for their hard work  #overwatch
927607297832087554 2017-11-06 18:43:08 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch mustve just not shown up in my game yet. thank you for the quick reply!
927601426309763072 2017-11-06 18:19:48 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch no spray/player icon reward for competitive season 7?
926647945558134784 2017-11-03 03:11:01 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch I love Overwatch and all the hard work put into the game but for the love of god all the new maps are SO BIG ITS TOO MUCH 
926630414806081537 2017-11-03 02:01:21 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch they work so hard on this game yassss 
926300825957359616 2017-11-02 04:11:41 UTC <lainboi_> @Animetic yet at the same time at this rate Id prefer the old res. a lot of times with mercy 1.1 (?), it would just = 2 team kills
925729476524347392 2017-11-01 14:21:21 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch so Im happy Ana is getting a much needed buff but mercys nerf is a bit much. resing is suicide? not fun.
925729086399569921 2017-11-01 14:19:48 UTC <lainboi_> @Animetic so basically resing w/o Valkyrie=suicide. great. thanks, blizzard.

917773911487639552 2017-10-10 15:28:46 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch question - for console players (specifically ps4) is there going to be an app update for the event?

916057196387012608 2017-10-05 21:47:09 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch bless papa Goodman & daddy Kaplan

915753999550337024 2017-10-04 01:42:22 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch @playoverwatch I get that Mercy needs a bit of a nerf but she doesn't need to be murdered >:(

967220905448525824 2018-02-23 02:13:28 UTC <lainboi_> @BuckleUrPants waIT Im confused do people in eu put the dates backwards bc to me this looks like January third but it probably means March first ahhHHHH
965027167062110210 2018-02-17 00:56:20 UTC <lainboi_> @matthewmercer YOUR VOICE IS IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY FAVORITE VIDEO GAMES (and a few of my favorite characters!) why are you like this, so wonderful
964182378267795456 2018-02-15 16:59:27 UTC <lainboi_> @heyimnotkatie @Leopardus_emma @Faticatipeter the point has gone directly over your head & I dont want to talk about it anymore. 17 people died the other day. and unfortunately people have to be scared if theyre next.
964181481911472129 2018-02-15 16:55:53 UTC <lainboi_> @heyimnotkatie @Leopardus_emma @Faticatipeter Im fully aware but its possible because of family members uselessly owning guns. its where the problem for teens getting guns begins.
964180209468628994 2018-02-15 16:50:50 UTC <lainboi_> @heyimnotkatie @Faticatipeter @Leopardus_emma I just ignored the tweet assuming they were being sarcastic \_()_/ and if I, a mentally unstable 16 year old, could get a hold of a gun, and Im sure I could, wed really be screwed because other people like me could get one 
963968677858152448 2018-02-14 02:50:17 UTC <lainboi_> @heyimnotkatie tfw I live in the US and I dont at all feel safe leaving my house because everyone in my area owns guns \_()_/
963217745549537281 2018-02-12 01:06:20 UTC <lainboi_> @FlatEarthOrg okay so Ive come to the conclusion that the Flat Earth Society is one big joke. theres no way it isnt. people dont seriously believe that the earth is flat, right? saying the earth is flat is like saying ah, theres a big invisible alien spaceship above us!
963124658328436737 2018-02-12 18:56:27 UTC <lainboi_> @FlatEarthOrg you... you guys are joking, right? theres absolutely no way I could take you seriously...
962234699849584640 2018-02-10 08:00:04 UTC <lainboi_> @AeroViro hi um why does Ryuji remind me of beast boy from teen titans?pic.twitter.com/DBkqHFizuJ

961048589584797702 2018-02-06 01:26:53 UTC <lainboi_> @AeroViro so Im watching your p5 play through... I wont be sleeping for the next 91 hours :)
960692614252171266 2018-02-05 01:52:22 UTC <lainboi_> @hollyhollywood yep! It was a few days ago so I got it working again! thank you though!
959803711110504448 2018-02-03 15:00:11 UTC <lainboi_> @OW_Pachimari it happens at random & has nothing to do with their consoles, I know one got the blurry screen from opening the menu & had to dc to fix it, another picked a hero & just dropped out, and another had a black screen & couldnt see anything & had to dc :/ ty for the help though :)
959633775863980032 2018-02-02 03:44:55 UTC <lainboi_> @BlizzardCS hi! my friends keep disconnecting and losing sr! on PS4! please fix, I havent fixed my forums battle net account yet to report the bug \_()_/
959143017067278337 2018-02-01 19:14:49 UTC <lainboi_> @WyomingMyst Ill try both if one doesnt work. thank you for the help!
959142335849336832 2018-02-01 19:12:07 UTC <lainboi_> @WyomingMyst I did, if you have to do it from the console. I can login via pc and view my PS4 stats from my battle net profile & it says its linked, I think the problem was what blizz said it was, Ive never really messed with the controls :)
959141798634491904 2018-02-01 19:09:59 UTC <lainboi_> @BlizzardCS Ill try it! thank you for the quick reply! :)
959138604357386240 2018-02-01 18:57:17 UTC <lainboi_> @BlizzardCS hello, I just tried to use the Overwatch blizzard forums (for the first time) and it says my ability to post is disabled. my question is: what in tarnation?
959138053129474054 2018-02-01 18:55:06 UTC <lainboi_> @erdmozkan @unitlostgaming my friend the other night had this issue too when he went to give Mei a crosshair & he ended up disconnecting (in comp)
958875888153780224 2018-01-31 01:33:21 UTC <lainboi_> Honestly Mercy is 100% still playable at all ranks but she isnt super necessary now. it feels good to be able to play Zenyatta and Lucio more but also still be able to play Mercy! #overwatch #mercy #mercynerf
958860443006787584 2018-01-31 00:31:59 UTC <lainboi_> @LieutenantEddy as a Mercy main tbh I agree. still got to masters for the first time with nerfed Mercy! got to play a little Zen as well... feels refreshing tbh. Id forgotten how much I actually loved all of the supports! :D
958801995523133440 2018-01-31 20:39:44 UTC <lainboi_> @BlizzardCS nevermind! I signed into another account & then back in and it opened! I was very confused lol
958801023820353536 2018-01-31 20:35:52 UTC <lainboi_> @BlizzardCS on PS4 Ive been staring at the please wait... screen for 20 minutes trying to get into Overwatch, and all psn services are up and running. has my account gotten banned? I didnt get an email & I didnt do anything to get banned...
958800516154314757 2018-01-31 20:33:51 UTC <lainboi_> @ApplyOW I just got whiplash from reading that

958498266483712001 2018-01-30 00:32:49 UTC <lainboi_> next developer update   hi this is Jeff from the Overwatch team and weve got another Mercy rework coming in where weve removed her healing caduceus and her resurrect and buffed the damage on her pistol. shes now a dps. #overwatch #ripmercy
958446694953299969 2018-01-30 21:07:53 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @Kailkun @hoboinab0x @Darkprincejonny I feel that on a very personal level xd. I started in silver & now Im like 20 sr from masters (I bought the game in season 4)
958446335564369924 2018-01-30 21:06:28 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x @Kailkun Junkrat is... hmm. hes fine/was decently fine, the only reason I hate him was because I was killed by him like 100 times in one day as soldier, and that was pre-buff. but still, hes kinda... idk. I dont play him so I shouldnt really have too big a say in that matter.
958445819790856192 2018-01-30 21:04:25 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x @Kailkun its very unfortunate, the state of which everyones mind is in related to mercy. like, sorry sty, but Mercy is important to the community & should have never been reworked.
958444857986617345 2018-01-30 21:00:35 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x @Kailkun also I blocked that hoboinabox dude because hes dumb and (based off of his twitter) sexist. just uh... keep that in mind...
958444531342626817 2018-01-30 20:59:17 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x @Kailkun not at all, I now very much dislike her kit. I want them to fix it, as does everyone else. theres no way to balance res as a second ability. reverting her is the only way.
958440271536185344 2018-01-30 20:42:22 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x @Kailkun I agree and I very much appreciate your attitude about it. after overlooking the frustration of yet another nerf I see that mercy will always be a very powerful healer, being that shes consistent, mobile, and can still res sometimes. Im not scared of losing masters! :)
958425044534939649 2018-01-30 19:41:51 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x shell always be in the meta. sucks for you, I guess. goodbye now, its probably safe for me to just block you.
958424874527182848 2018-01-30 19:41:11 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x doesnt matter, this conversation is over. Ive got no use talking to a goddamn brick wall.
958424579634094081 2018-01-30 19:40:01 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @mateboer_jan @hoboinab0x doubtful. shell probably be reworked in the future.
958424459991543808 2018-01-30 19:39:32 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x good for you. nobody cares.
958424346560811008 2018-01-30 19:39:05 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x and you have no idea how I play Mercy, you have no idea what my rank is, none of that. so how would you know that Im not a skillful Mercy player? how would you know that I cant play other heroes? your opinion is invalid, good day sir.
958423650641829888 2018-01-30 19:36:19 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x and Im pretty sure lucio requires the least amount of skill from any hero to be relatively effective.
958422883738509312 2018-01-30 19:33:16 UTC <lainboi_> @unitlostgaming @hoboinab0x a: mercy requires a different skill set from other heroes, aim doesnt equal skill.  b: I know how to play other heroes & im really good at Ana and mccree and dva, but I very much enjoy playing Mercy for her fun mobility.  c: never assume mercy mains have no skills.
958419704808398851 2018-01-30 19:20:38 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch I wish you guys wouldve taken a little more time to tweak Mercy before you took a hatchet to her already dead corpse. guess Im a lucio main now \_()_/
958418350450925568 2018-01-30 19:15:15 UTC <lainboi_> @Animetic reeeeeee guess Ill have to get masters playing lucio... dust off my ana skills.
958369038970900480 2018-01-30 15:59:19 UTC <lainboi_> @AeroViro has anyone ever told you that your laugh is incredibly contagious? its a good thing 
957759536651218944 2018-01-28 23:37:22 UTC <lainboi_> @EeveeA_ yes please
957271295250624513 2018-01-27 15:17:16 UTC <lainboi_> @Animetic question: when do you normally stream? and fantastic video, as per usual! :D
956959434831515649 2018-01-26 18:38:03 UTC <lainboi_> @AskPlayStation happens to the best of us. hope you can find the issue & squash it for a long while! :D
956548710627979264 2018-01-25 15:25:59 UTC <lainboi_> @AnneMunition @EeveeA_ @zaya_linn on smurfs, at least thats how I do it. I play near masters level on mercy on my main, then I have a smurf to play with my plat friends, and a smurf to practice dps and tank, which is in gold (but I gain like 50 sr per win and lose like 30)
956350687130079233 2018-01-24 02:19:06 UTC <lainboi_> @Co_Mill she/he (?) looks a lot like my dog Shelby!
956219474478358529 2018-01-24 17:37:43 UTC <lainboi_> @AeroViro question because im new to discord stuff: how does one join your discord server thing pls help
955925971076636673 2018-01-23 22:11:26 UTC <lainboi_> @AskPlayStation @RimmeBoltjes @kriswicks84 @Soraxel1115 @MA1NFRAM3D2 @vfl1980 Im in NC but my Minnesota friends are also having issues
955912785870905344 2018-01-23 21:19:02 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayStation @AskPlayStation rip to everyone wanting to play Overwatch with their friends from the cosmetics update on blizz world lol
955912368680263682 2018-01-23 21:17:23 UTC <lainboi_> @AskPlayStation @RimmeBoltjes @kriswicks84 @Soraxel1115 @MA1NFRAM3D2 irony at its finest ;)
955418206491021318 2018-01-22 12:33:45 UTC <lainboi_> @EeveeA_ I hella miss old mercy, and Ive enjoyed 2.0 so far but this next nerf is going to make me hate playing her :( I used to do a lot of clutch 2-mans and those big team reses were sooooo satisfying
955184363884482560 2018-01-21 21:04:33 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch cant wait for this update. also cant wait for the devs to finally revert Mercy back to 1.0 :)
954764354922131456 2018-01-20 17:15:35 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch I know its such a small detail but I miss when it was play of the match in competitive because it made it feel more special? if that makes sense?
954510704391933952 2018-01-19 00:27:40 UTC <lainboi_> @EeveeA_ I just want Mercy 1.0 back... but your idea is really cool just not something everyone would be willing to get used to. earning res would help a lot but its single target...
954137465333452801 2018-01-18 23:44:33 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch mmmmmmmmm I love it and what Id love even more... Mercy 1.0 being ... RESURRECTED
952221584135159808 2018-01-13 16:51:31 UTC <lainboi_> also keep GA the way it is now on live! it helps in survivability!
952221322284863490 2018-01-13 16:50:29 UTC <lainboi_> tbh I think blizz should just revert Mercy back to Mercy 1.0, where she can res the whole team but isnt invincible. I think wed all like that. shell never be balanced if it doesnt happen... #Overwatch
951943226960830465 2018-01-12 22:25:26 UTC <lainboi_> @LieutenantEddy why do you call yourself lieutenant?

949284572637876224 2018-01-05 14:20:53 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch what if you just slow down Valkyrie & take away the extra res charge and make valk 15 seconds. basically what you have planned but dont put a cast time on res in valk
949282672425275392 2018-01-05 14:13:20 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch I guess Im a dps main now since thats the group the devs seem to cater to \_()_/

I feel like they dont get enough credit for their hard work  #overwatch
927607297832087554 2017-11-06 18:43:08 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch mustve just not shown up in my game yet. thank you for the quick reply!
927601426309763072 2017-11-06 18:19:48 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch no spray/player icon reward for competitive season 7?
926647945558134784 2017-11-03 03:11:01 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch I love Overwatch and all the hard work put into the game but for the love of god all the new maps are SO BIG ITS TOO MUCH 
926630414806081537 2017-11-03 02:01:21 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch they work so hard on this game yassss 
926300825957359616 2017-11-02 04:11:41 UTC <lainboi_> @Animetic yet at the same time at this rate Id prefer the old res. a lot of times with mercy 1.1 (?), it would just = 2 team kills
925729476524347392 2017-11-01 14:21:21 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch so Im happy Ana is getting a much needed buff but mercys nerf is a bit much. resing is suicide? not fun.
925729086399569921 2017-11-01 14:19:48 UTC <lainboi_> @Animetic so basically resing w/o Valkyrie=suicide. great. thanks, blizzard.

917773911487639552 2017-10-10 15:28:46 UTC <lainboi_> @PlayOverwatch question - for console players (specifically ps4) is there going to be an app update for the event?
