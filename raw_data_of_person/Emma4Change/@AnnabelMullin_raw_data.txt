954359474302717952 2018-01-19 14:26:44 UTC <AnnabelMullin> It would appear that nothing is safe from the effect of rising costs in a post-Brexit world  not even McVitie's Original Digestives. Packets are to be cut from 500g to 400g, which just takes the biscuit. Or seven, in fact. #BrexitReality @timesredboxpic.twitter.com/JkicUHN7I6

954260471229624320 2018-01-18 07:53:20 UTC <AnnabelMullin> How we look after the most vulnerable is one of the most important indicators of how our society is functioning. It is deeply disturbing that our prisons are uninhabitable.

944254229371342848 2017-12-22 17:12:06 UTC <AnnabelMullin> @japster2008 Thank you. My reading of it is that he is suggesting that it is a lie to claim that only as we are leaving that we can have blue passports & he is right. We could always have had blue passports. But he neednt have used word. Im sick of it 2 & Im deeply concerned for the future

941951334785437696 2017-12-16 08:41:13 UTC <AnnabelMullin> #Maggie on today I am the first to say that on many great issues the countries of Europe should try to speak with a single voice. Europe is stronger when we do so, whether it be in trade, in defence or in our relations with the rest of the world. 20 September 1988 Bruges
941949261884911616 2017-12-16 08:32:59 UTC <AnnabelMullin> Welcome to #1984 - Ive always loved the book - didnt think Id be living in it. #Newspeakhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-gets-list-of-forbidden-words-fetus-transgender-diversity/2017/12/15/f503837a-e1cf-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html
941946164437495808 2017-12-16 08:20:40 UTC <AnnabelMullin> How did the Brexiteers imagine it would turn out? Of course this will be the way - having to accept laws "without any say-so" from the British people.

941671978032910336 2017-12-15 14:11:09 UTC <AnnabelMullin> Couldnt agree more. Local justice has been entirely hollowed out. Leaving victims, defendants, prisoners & our society suffering. If we want to create a future vision it must include all aspects and criminal justice has become a shadow of what it could and should be. #justicehttps://twitter.com/cvhclaire/status/941664781236363264

Being grateful for that help, using skills appropriately, finding a persons niche is good management. Every institutional party needs work in these areas, we need politics fit for 21st Century.

I do place burden of ownership on those within parliament who have current 'control' of process. Those who decided that supplying 'will of the people' meant representing only 51% rather than all people in a grown up way.

879237485506809856 2017-06-26 07:18:46 UTC <AnnabelMullin> @julieblaw But that isn't the land value, that is the property value
879236748114616320 2017-06-26 07:15:50 UTC <AnnabelMullin> @julieblaw But it' based on land value not the property value, so it isn't scale 4 another mortgage. As with all b gd to  how other countries do it
