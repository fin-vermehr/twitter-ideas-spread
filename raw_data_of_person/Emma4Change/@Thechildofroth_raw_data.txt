966577812697214978 2018-02-21 07:38:03 UTC <Thechildofroth> @elocemearg @Theinformantmag @marykmac @carmelneale I just think the interest rate is a red-herring. The issue is the threshold and the concurrent income tax and loan repayment calculation. Yes repayments increase with earnings but only in proportion, makes the claim of 'hardship' sounds overblown.
966374157675126785 2018-02-21 18:08:48 UTC <Thechildofroth> @elocemearg @Theinformantmag @marykmac @carmelneale A good line of credit with BOMAD is a good line of credit. If we re-arrange student finance those parents will find other ways to privileged their kids (buying houses, paying rent, supporting internships etc etc)
966373656396955648 2018-02-21 18:06:48 UTC <Thechildofroth> @elocemearg @Theinformantmag @marykmac @carmelneale One has to be careful not to think of student funding in terms of mortgages or loans, because it doesn't function in anywhere near the same way. It's not a 50k debt it's a 9% tax on earnings over the threshold for up to 30yrs.
966373181404712960 2018-02-21 18:04:55 UTC <Thechildofroth> @elocemearg @Theinformantmag @marykmac @carmelneale I see where you're coming from. IMO written off debt is not debt, it doesn't matter the size of the number of the fact that it's 'un-repayable' because it will disappear at yr30. The hard-done folk are the middle earners who settle up in total in Yr30, that's an expensive degree!
966249185900195846 2018-02-21 09:52:12 UTC <Thechildofroth> @elocemearg @Theinformantmag @marykmac @carmelneale I don't see how its a trap? You've also picked a very odd earnings profile to demonstrate it. There is definitely a pinched middle effect but I see no trap.
966217041739943936 2018-02-20 07:44:28 UTC <Thechildofroth> @elocemearg @Theinformantmag @marykmac @carmelneale The loan is time limited so there can be no 'debt trap' it's only a notional debt. 'All' graduates are tied to is 9% of earning over the threshold for 30 years - it's only a loan in name (to make it collectable across borders) it's really a micro-hypothecated tax.
966024412863586305 2018-02-20 18:59:02 UTC <Thechildofroth> @elocemearg @carmelneale @Theinformantmag @marykmac The final abuse that most people miss is that loan repayments and income tax are calculated concurrently, so graduates pay twice for uni. Should take loan repayment on full salary and tax on the residue.
966024055068479490 2018-02-20 18:57:37 UTC <Thechildofroth> @elocemearg @carmelneale @Theinformantmag @marykmac Agreed, the removal of grants for the poorest and the shifting of the taper rate from biggest to smallest loans was the second most henious abuse after the freezing of the threshold
966023730630725633 2018-02-20 18:56:19 UTC <Thechildofroth> @elocemearg @carmelneale @Theinformantmag @marykmac The system we have (if run right, which it's not) is the most progressive system there is. It started out badly implemented and got worse, freezing the repayment threshold was the most henious abuse of graduates.
966023316409634816 2018-02-20 18:54:41 UTC <Thechildofroth> @elocemearg @carmelneale @Theinformantmag @marykmac It's not 9% interest it's 9% of earnings over the threshold repaid. Interest rates don't affect repayment amount, that's pegged to income, and the whole lot is written of after 30 years regardless of how much has been repaid.
965976177037971456 2018-02-20 15:47:22 UTC <Thechildofroth> Wow it's like Leeds is in some sort of futuristic utopia compared to @GreaterCambs @CambsPboroCA How's your cycle infra @JamieFawcett1 ?
965951006419947520 2018-02-20 14:07:21 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofgem Hello again, I'm still not in receipt of a proper response, where are energy prices published for the purposes of comparison? (I don't want a switch site I want the data that drives the switch sites) please?
965650513931927552 2018-02-19 18:13:18 UTC <Thechildofroth> I just read a rumour that The Pointer Sisters 'I'm so Excited' was originally written for Michael Jackson and that there's an old demo knocking about somewhere, anyone got it to share?

965534718757408769 2018-02-19 10:33:10 UTC <Thechildofroth> Hi @ofgem  please can you direct me to where you publish the raw data of energy providers' pricing for the purposes of comparison?
965273590194229260 2018-02-18 17:15:32 UTC <Thechildofroth> @crabbitcopy Nice clip, @GreaterCambs it's this, not more bus lanes, that you should be focused on.
964851289006985216 2018-02-17 13:17:28 UTC <Thechildofroth> Nah, bi/non-partisan observer. It's just 'LD Tuition Fee traitor' rant is about as valid/useful/interesting as the 'Labour Iraq war' one.

964768807012241408 2018-02-16 07:49:42 UTC <Thechildofroth> Hi @ofgem where do you aggregate and publish energy suppliers prices please?
964426211735748609 2018-02-16 09:08:21 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ChrisRandWrites @JulesHoward I dunno, Cambs transport planning and infrastructure is so poorly planned and implemented that even the most average 12 yr old could call it out pretty strongly.
964211906461519922 2018-02-15 18:56:47 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofgem Surely you mandate that energy suppliers publish their pricing data in a comparable format, so that comparison and switch sites can work? All I want is a link to that feed and the spec for the API to query it, please.
964205034501107712 2018-02-15 18:29:28 UTC <Thechildofroth> Exciting indeed, this is a great record.https://twitter.com/MammothPenguins/status/964200744663572480
964159589506797568 2018-02-15 15:28:54 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofgem Thanks, I'd like a 'realtime' feed of energy suppliers prices please.
964091973555671040 2018-02-15 11:00:13 UTC <Thechildofroth> Do @ofgem have a published API to pull down energy prices for the purposes of comparison? If so where is it (and if not why not)?

963079448903016448 2018-02-12 15:56:48 UTC <Thechildofroth> @SheenaParks20 @george157389 I'm no expert but doesn't the connection between trump and brexit go something like: vladimir putin - shady oligarch - D Trump Jr - shady oligarch - Julian Assange - Nigel Farage (Brexit) - Donald Trump (Trump)   With a supporting cast of disaster capitalists.
963058672472600582 2018-02-12 14:34:14 UTC <Thechildofroth> @SheenaParks20 @george157389 Also you asserted, twice, that POTUS and brexit aren't linked so cussing me for not linking them now is a poor show.  Anyway, the benefits of brexit for the working class in your own words, in 240chars or more. Go!
963057770017755136 2018-02-12 14:30:39 UTC <Thechildofroth> @SheenaParks20 @george157389 OP asserts that those that dislike brexit and Trump are enemies of the working class. Certainly on brexit every indicator is that brexit itself is an existential risk to the working class, so I don't think asking for examples of why it's not is too far fetched.
963057216818466819 2018-02-12 14:28:27 UTC <Thechildofroth> @SheenaParks20 @george157389 I've parroted nothing I simply asked a question about the benefits to the working class of either Trump or Brexit and you've come at me with sophistry + assertions that I have linked the topics (which actually happened in the OP)

962776955945914379 2018-02-11 19:54:48 UTC <Thechildofroth> @SheenaParks20 @george157389 Thanks george157389, I'll rephrase the question: list us a couple of benefits the working class are going to derive from Mr Trump and/or Brexit please? (if you must weigh in even though you're only able to discuss one, state whice one it is and stick to it).
962744598916452352 2018-02-11 17:46:13 UTC <Thechildofroth> @SheenaParks20 @george157389 Compelling, those tax cuts were specifically targeted at the working class, right? Not sure how brexit ensures we get these things any more than staying though, do you?
962674513082241028 2018-02-11 13:07:44 UTC <Thechildofroth> @SheenaParks20 @mattoidmattoid @sandytim100 Thanks Tim, so you can't think of anything. Noted.
962443752395694081 2018-02-10 21:50:46 UTC <Thechildofroth> I don't take this 'Govt has no plan' biz. They clearly do, it's to crash the country as chaotically as possible in to the hands of their disaster capitalist overlords hoping they'll be personally pulled up out of the mess they've crafted.
962441088945524743 2018-02-10 21:40:11 UTC <Thechildofroth> @PARDONMYHASHTAG Barry's an obvious fake, as is the other 'brexitieer' account that enaged the tea people on this theme this week. It's starting to look like an advertising campaign.
962434037649494016 2018-02-10 21:12:10 UTC <Thechildofroth> @SheenaParks20 Just for the sake of clarity, could you just list us a couple of benefits the working class are going to derive from Mr Trump and Brexit please?
962425013013045249 2018-02-10 20:36:18 UTC <Thechildofroth> @JeremySteptoe To the EU? LOL
962303394831589376 2018-02-10 12:33:02 UTC <Thechildofroth> @JeremySteptoe Yeah, the burden of all that Japanese car manufacturing and the corresponding death of employment in the north east will clearly have rattled them. Suckers.
962257910419066880 2018-02-10 09:32:18 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ShaunKing Yes please.

Although I note that the one I just looked at (Line 11) is under proposal to move to steel wheels. The rubber wheeled trains do appear to be a minor part of the network as a whole.

958291188238503937 2018-01-30 10:49:58 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs When is a bus not a bus?  When it's a 'Metro'   You lot are off your heads.

(which is the point of the OP)   At least in coalition LDs mitigated some disasters, looks like Lab are aiding and abetting from here.

924652497733652481 2017-10-29 15:01:49 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ajc1001 At least they haven't spoiled it, like Terminus House (yet).
924560532136513537 2017-10-29 08:56:23 UTC <Thechildofroth> @billmckibben I wish we had a government capable of not fucking up their most basic civic duties - this lot can't even stop people starving #shambles

924329139439570947 2017-10-28 17:36:54 UTC <Thechildofroth> @DietPi_ @Gadgetoid Damn, I was just trying to help and it's gone all saline....
924328931918012417 2017-10-28 17:36:05 UTC <Thechildofroth> Neat, @MoodeAudio would be a great addition to @DietPi_https://twitter.com/MoodeAudio/status/924258913549258752

923636062454501376 2017-10-26 19:42:52 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Gadgetoid Perhaps the chaps @DietPi_ can help?
923587649637699585 2017-10-26 16:30:29 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambsCops @CambsCC @gnomeicide You've been deceived, that's not a cycle lane (or a pavement) thanks to @CllrPeterSarris
923581559944482817 2017-10-26 16:06:17 UTC <Thechildofroth> I just listened to every No1 from 2017, much like most of 2017 it could have been better!
923486433809256449 2017-10-26 09:48:18 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KimSJ That's essentially what oxford are saying in para26 of their Access Agreement (and is part of why the govt won't use the stick with them)
923474439928451073 2017-10-26 09:00:38 UTC <Thechildofroth> @suttontrust @paulmasonnews The media's obsession with oxbridge, reinforcing the notion that it is the route to power, solidifies their position as the route to power
923473936418996224 2017-10-26 08:58:38 UTC <Thechildofroth> @suttontrust @paulmasonnews How about focusing on the work of the 128 other universities, some of which set positive examples, this just hands more power to oxbridge
923211063801282560 2017-10-25 15:34:04 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambsCC @GoCambsTidalBus @LibralLady By the way, I appreciate your patience with me, I can see why the council wouldn't want this to be too transparent!
923210603526873089 2017-10-25 15:32:14 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambsCC @GoCambsTidalBus @LibralLady So the statement on that page, that the council pays special responsibility allowance, isn't true?
923210220641406982 2017-10-25 15:30:43 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambsCC @GoCambsTidalBus @LibralLady And how would one get that from the data you linked me to? There are no columns that go from something to nothing in the allowance scheme.
923206459214778368 2017-10-25 15:15:46 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambsCC @GoCambsTidalBus @LibralLady How much is your special responsibility allowance now? It's not easy to descern from https://ccc-live.storage.googleapis.com/upload/www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/council/councillors-&-meetings/Public%20Notice%20-%20Cambridgeshire%20County%20Council%20Members%27%20Allowances%20Scheme%20-%20July%202017.pdf?inline=true
923203908952100864 2017-10-25 15:05:38 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambsCC @GoCambsTidalBus @LibralLady Because your special responsibilities pay has gone down more than your basic has gone up?
923201539463942144 2017-10-25 14:56:13 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambsCC @GoCambsTidalBus @LibralLady Will you be handing back the difference between 8.6k and 10.3k then (your individual councillor allowance)?
923201011761729537 2017-10-25 14:54:08 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambsCC @GoCambsTidalBus @LibralLady Ok, I see https://ccc-live.storage.googleapis.com/upload/www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/council/councillors-&-meetings/Public%20Notice%20-%20Cambridgeshire%20County%20Council%20Members%27%20Allowances%20Scheme%20-%20July%202017.pdf?inline=true it'd be funny if it wasn't such a brilliant example of breathtaking greed and general contempt.
923197240730116096 2017-10-25 14:39:09 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambsCC @GoCambsTidalBus @LibralLady How many groups of cllrs are there? Where can I see which of the grps tk rises or cuts? ('councillors got pay rise' isn't univerally true?)
923194345544732672 2017-10-25 14:27:38 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambsCC @GoCambsTidalBus @LibralLady So presumably the councillors who had this foisted on them and understand it's wrong have handed the extra money back, right?
922920654969507840 2017-10-24 20:20:05 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GoodwinMJ @IsabelOakeshott Yeah! maybe the govt should publish that impact report, so we have an objective measure to judge bias against?
922920076784803840 2017-10-24 20:17:47 UTC <Thechildofroth> @220_d_92_20 Presumably that last resort would be the potential loss of a majority or an election....
922886815937449985 2017-10-24 18:05:37 UTC <Thechildofroth> @camcitco @FixMiltonRoad Also, allowing HG house to be demolished is architectural vandalism.

922876516161245186 2017-10-24 17:24:42 UTC <Thechildofroth> @FixMiltonRoad That whole stretch from the waterman to the boathouse should be pedestrianised and turned over to a market or sommit.

919813715251335169 2017-10-15 06:34:13 UTC <Thechildofroth> @MichaelH14 @thenavvie @Purplepetal @vmooed How much profit do SLC make?

919548072610459649 2017-10-15 12:58:39 UTC <Thechildofroth> @MichaelH14 @Purplepetal @thenavvie @Melkshamboy59 Yup, a generation were lost for the sake of a system that actually costs taxpayers more. Another example of the low grade governance we get.

919121981295026178 2017-10-14 08:45:31 UTC <Thechildofroth> @MichaelH14 @Purplepetal @thenavvie True, if lenders/landlords misunderstand the mechanics of student finance too it could be disastrous for grads. Repayments count more.
919120725625143296 2017-10-14 08:40:32 UTC <Thechildofroth> @MichaelH14 @thenavvie @Purplepetal They are obliged to work out repayability and risk, they have to ask. Its unclear what the actual impact on access to the mortgage is here.
919110703797161984 2017-10-14 08:00:42 UTC <Thechildofroth> @MichaelH14 @thenavvie @Purplepetal The rules have been in play since 2012, some aspects have changed but interest isn't one of them.
919102490787962880 2017-10-14 07:28:04 UTC <Thechildofroth> @MichaelH14 @thenavvie @Purplepetal IMO the interest rate is a govt approved red herring.

919101557488128001 2017-10-14 07:24:22 UTC <Thechildofroth> @MichaelH14 @thenavvie @Purplepetal You agreed to RPI +(up to)3%.  More due dilligence? Student loans aren't fair but it's not cos of the interest calcs. Threshold = main prob
919099700552327168 2017-10-14 07:16:59 UTC <Thechildofroth> @LabourLeft @MichaelH14 @1ddebrun The other scandal is the concurrent calc of income tax and loan repay, which means u pay twice. Shld be loan then income on remainder.

918740291124973568 2017-10-13 07:28:49 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Purplepetal @MichaelH14 RPI in March was 2.6% they are not accruing interest at 6% if they're earning under 21k
918738989762441216 2017-10-13 07:23:39 UTC <Thechildofroth> @MichaelH14 @MarkBurton_ Doesn't the fact that no one does this suggest that perhaps there isn't a better deal? Can repay student loan at any time, no penalty.

918738211970658304 2017-10-13 07:20:33 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Purplepetal @MichaelH14 Remind me, if they don't earn 21k what's the cost of their loan each month? What happens to any outstanding money at the end of 30yrs?
918532806376153088 2017-10-12 17:44:21 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike @magnayn I have no issue with your privately owned bike or if you chose to share it with others. I steer clear of anger as best I can but annoyed yes
918530701829525504 2017-10-12 17:35:59 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike @magnayn What about bus companies? Do I think they would they be better as social enterprises? Yes.
918530388510806016 2017-10-12 17:34:44 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @magnayn @tweetymike I prefer 'post-capitalist' if you must go throwing labels around it ;-)
918521443209629699 2017-10-12 16:59:12 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike @magnayn Social enterprise or CIC would probably do it. Shouldn't be loss making, surplus to be used on infra or free access for targeted groups.
918504506744299521 2017-10-12 15:51:54 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike @magnayn Sure, sorry I missed that subtlety, fair enough. A lot of my issue is to do with ownership so as I said depends on biz model and structure.
918502542300143618 2017-10-12 15:44:05 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @magnayn @tweetymike No, it's different, I was asked if it would make a difference: yes. Do I want it: no (but not for the same reasons as I disagree with Ofo)
918501748909772800 2017-10-12 15:40:56 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike @magnayn I'm not convinced that the council should own & run a bike hire biz (or that it would be in their interest) Not sure what you're getting at?
918500634520891392 2017-10-12 15:36:30 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @DonnachadhMc @stemps22 Yeah, practically it pays for the DUP I know that But in principal at least it's a tax for owning a car. Vehicle Excise Duty #cluesinthename
918500184044310528 2017-10-12 15:34:43 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike More cycle parking and better cycling infrastructure is always welcome - I'd hope that 'absent' co's like ofo would pay for them too.
918499832570007553 2017-10-12 15:33:19 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike I only subsequently pointed out that it is 'my street' (as in where I live), you're ascribing words and views to me that you've imagined.

918494941894111233 2017-10-12 15:13:53 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike @magnayn Probably, yes. Depends what the business model and structure was.
918382596245114880 2017-10-12 07:47:28 UTC <Thechildofroth> @camcitco @CambsCC @GreaterCambs Note, it's failed to stop the flow of cyclists through there, what's going to happen to any fresh tarmac they get down?
918366405803806720 2017-10-11 06:43:08 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc Yup, but abandoned bike hire is not the answer in Cambridge. We need better cycle infrastructure, but our council are fixated on bus lanes.
918365249413308416 2017-10-11 06:38:32 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc That's just whatabouting though, I'm not saying I don't want the same (or better) for cars....

918364506623041536 2017-10-11 06:35:35 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc The sort that ensures ofo pay their way for their use of the public domain (as a pillar of their profitability) + helps usrs park sensibly.
918361654114562048 2017-10-11 06:24:15 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike You're just trying to put words in my mouth now because you apparently can't compute that could be at once pro-bike & anti-ofo.
918359986392174592 2017-10-11 06:17:37 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc Exactly, parking space is not under the control of the motor industry, hence this being a regulatory issue.
918246591525466114 2017-10-11 22:47:02 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike Being anti-ofo doesn't mean I'm anti-bike or pro-car. I fear that might be we're you're not getting my point.
918244586887286784 2017-10-11 22:39:04 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike Ah, I thought you were talking about the political diff between a Ryanair jet and an Ofo bike (both privately owned but publicly accessible)
918240879982399489 2017-10-11 22:24:20 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike Between something that's privately owned yet publicly accessible and something that's privately owned and privately accessible Yes, can you?
918222746307481603 2017-10-11 21:12:17 UTC <Thechildofroth> @BarbicanCentre Reckon I may have unwittingly crossed paths with @BrutalHouse today @BarbicanLpic.twitter.com/mv5hy0t6rC
918219009685901312 2017-10-11 20:57:26 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike Their bikes are no more a 'shared asset' (as you put it) than a Ryanair plane.
918218647415508992 2017-10-11 20:55:59 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike I like bikes too, I ride most days. It doesn't mean I can't separate the object (bike) from the subjecf (ofo's business model).
918204170934673416 2017-10-11 19:58:28 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike No, 'Rentism' is what I'm talking about. Would you say a Ryanair plane fits the same bill, I can't afford a plane but I get to fly?
918203812178989063 2017-10-11 19:57:02 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike No, not at all. I'm a cycle commuter and I was on my bike when I saw it.
918189488387624960 2017-10-11 19:00:07 UTC <Thechildofroth> @philipcolligan Lose (covfefe)
918188885628383232 2017-10-11 18:57:44 UTC <Thechildofroth> @philipcolligan Did you leave it running from last night, or did you loose today to it too?
918187063635333120 2017-10-11 18:50:29 UTC <Thechildofroth> @philipcolligan I knew you'd be unable to resist, or rest until it was done. Good work!
918167234459176960 2017-10-11 17:31:42 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike Not sure what you're saying here Mike?
918167049540599809 2017-10-11 17:30:57 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @jonnohopkins Obviously no one has paid attention to the wall for some time, until it had a bike abandoned in front of it ;-)
918166336278335489 2017-10-11 17:28:07 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @DonnachadhMc Yup, and that embedded in their fuel costs too. Let's stop the whataboutism though, issue at hand is: ofo's margin depends on commons
918164875175694336 2017-10-11 17:22:19 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc The maker of the machine (car or bike) is not the 'guilty' party here, it's a regulatory issue.
918164520438304768 2017-10-11 17:20:55 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc Ofos business model relies on using public space to store their stock, car users/owners get favourable terms to store their property.
918149176852180992 2017-10-11 16:19:56 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc Fair point, but I think it's become linked to emissions rather than starting out as that (and that's probably another miss-step by govt)
918148707727675393 2017-10-11 16:18:04 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc So I should blame ofo's bike supplier for their rentism?
918148373047398402 2017-10-11 16:16:45 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc + VED paid on cars for access to streets, we're yet to see if Ofo 'do an amazon' on their liabilities I think.
918148090988847104 2017-10-11 16:15:37 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc Were the resource owned and controlled by a 'commons' then I might agree with you, but as it stands ofo are rentists.
918147506894266368 2017-10-11 16:13:18 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc no more than I'd blame the people who make ofo's bikes for them - that's an issue of regulation (and that's probably what's at issue here)
918146381226954756 2017-10-11 16:08:50 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc Cos you've missed the point. It's about the exploitation of the commons for profit, not about cars v bike (or transport at all).
918145812521250822 2017-10-11 16:06:34 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @KristianCyc I came here to impress you #missionaccomplished ;-)
918145641792069632 2017-10-11 16:05:53 UTC <Thechildofroth> @KristianCyc Lol #jumpingtoconclusions  What makes you instantly assume I'm a motorist?
918145249972838400 2017-10-11 16:04:20 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @KristianCyc Where do you see me asking for more cars? I was riding my bike when I nearly crashed in to this #wrongendofthestick
918144995168800768 2017-10-11 16:03:19 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @tweetymike Rentism /= shared asset, it belongs to a venture capital org. Funnily enough that actually is 'my' street (even though I said 'our' anyway)
918144205318492160 2017-10-11 16:00:11 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @KristianCyc Oh well, it must be ok then. Dump 500 bikes on the streets of Cambridge and expect us all to shuffle around them, great.
918142687303421953 2017-10-11 15:54:09 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @dazlington Hmmm, maybe you should give it a home in your garden or sommit then?
918142069176233984 2017-10-11 15:51:42 UTC <Thechildofroth> @ofo_bicycleUK @camcitco @DonnachadhMc No, they all pay VED so have paid for their access - private cycle owners have a different relationship with the commons to vulture capital.
918107257560358912 2017-10-11 13:33:22 UTC <Thechildofroth> @carltonreid 'Dockless' AKA Street litter - exploiting the commons to turn a profit, poor show, we're better than this surely?

918034911122087936 2017-10-11 08:45:53 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Andrew_Adonis How about unfreezing / raising the repayment threshold and putting some real money back in gradates' pockets? #quitplayinggames

917890004910792704 2017-10-10 23:10:05 UTC <Thechildofroth> @philipcolligan heheh, are you saying the destruction of the universe in pursuit of paperclips is not a valid use of one's time?

897728016637456384 2017-08-16 07:53:32 UTC <Thechildofroth> @DaraMorefield It's ok, soon it will be a treeless bus motorway for fen and scambs villages, much less desirable to live in thanks to @GreaterCambs
897498688490057728 2017-08-15 16:42:16 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Puffles2010 @rogermosey The freezing of the repayment threshold is a bigger kick in the teeth to most. Interest affects high and upper middle earners more.

893728558262214658 2017-08-05 07:01:07 UTC <Thechildofroth> @DaraMorefield Elizabeth way roundabout is poor decision and reflects a real loss of opportunity.

889918033455697920 2017-07-25 18:39:27 UTC <Thechildofroth> @PeterboroughCC I hereby give due credit to @RTaylorUK for reporting meetings, no matter how exasperating & tedious, and being a useful ally to democracy.
889916803664801795 2017-07-25 18:34:34 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @RTaylorUK @CllrPeterSarris Is it just the residents/businesses lacking in imagination or are their reps feeding them some 'gets worse or no change' option narrative?

887757526208565249 2017-07-19 19:34:22 UTC <Thechildofroth> @RadWagon @RTaylorUK How about a common sense audit? If cllrs want parking install parking, if they want bikes install cycle lane, this is neither fish nor fowl
887741624163479552 2017-07-19 18:31:11 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @RTaylorUK Given the evidence to date, cars in cycle lanes means they can claim 'multi-modal' victory?
887741399009046534 2017-07-19 18:30:17 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @RTaylorUK Are cycle lanes better for parking in? Perhaps that's why they're doing it? Futile putting a park bay there if you want cars to park, right?
887697534533197824 2017-07-19 15:35:59 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @RTaylorUK Since when did anyone but Royal Correspondents give a flying hoot about 'the done thing' rather than 'the right thing'?
887674488413970433 2017-07-19 14:04:24 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @RTaylorUK Does she have the raw data on the cost / impact of roundabout vs T-junction to share?
887674206670000129 2017-07-19 14:03:17 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @CllrTimBick @RTaylorUK That's a bit self congratulatory, it just doesn't achieve much.
887673616808148992 2017-07-19 14:00:57 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @RTaylorUK Please tell Cllr Scutt she's wrong and it's perhaps the worst error in the whole shambles they're presiding over.
887672132519559168 2017-07-19 13:55:03 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs I understand East rd burned fingers but why is there no plan for Elizabeth Way? The bridge could be much better / greener
887671771876524034 2017-07-19 13:53:37 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs have you got comparative price and impact data for Eliz Way / milton rd roundabout vs T junction (as per original plan)?
887669934968451072 2017-07-19 13:46:19 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @CommonsTrans @LilianGreenwood @RTaylorUK @Puffles2010 @camcycle @johnstevenson_x Apparently not, once they've finished rebuilding their website they might deign to send a delegation in to Cambridge, if they can find it!

887666386310451201 2017-07-19 13:32:13 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs Will they be implemented with sensible rights of way, so I don't have to stand in the rain waiting for warm tin boxes to inch past?
887664660266311680 2017-07-19 13:25:21 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @cllrbridget And why are all the artists impressions of the unimportant stretches and not the all important junctions?
887664443244634112 2017-07-19 13:24:29 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @cllrbridget Most sensible view I've seen expressed yet. If they know that why are they not closing Milton Rd end of Highworth Ave?

887661206114271233 2017-07-19 13:11:38 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @RTaylorUK I reckon I can guess the answer to that one, but I live in the hope of being wrong!
887587078409768960 2017-07-19 08:17:04 UTC <Thechildofroth> @CambridgeNewsUK @CllrGehring It's just as well no one is profiting from this rolling shambles isn't it.....
887069928221790208 2017-07-17 22:02:06 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs May we have some visuals of the major junctions please? Streetscene is crucial at these points where shared uses mix and merge.

887024143757127680 2017-07-17 19:00:10 UTC <Thechildofroth> @RTaylorUK Is that a legitimate question or are they just taking the piss? Is @GreaterCambs fit for purpose, does it know what it's purpose is?

886591978787438592 2017-07-16 14:22:54 UTC <Thechildofroth> @WarmongerHodges @Mauginog With no presupposition of the need for a valid question or a properly informed polis? That's a narrow (and flawed) definition of democracy.

886565541900677121 2017-07-16 12:37:51 UTC <Thechildofroth> @WarmongerHodges @BaynesMelanie Parliament asked for the advice of the people, they voted for an advisory referendum not a binding one.
886564290383290372 2017-07-16 12:32:53 UTC <Thechildofroth> @WarmongerHodges @BaynesMelanie By that logic, once we are clear on the real impact of that decision entails, the people should also decide if that's what they meant/want?

886290803596963840 2017-07-15 18:26:08 UTC <Thechildofroth> The option was 'fuck it up' or 'don't fuck it up' so we're now looking at 'fuck it up more' or 'fuck it up less'. #eitherwaywerefucked
885575567822794758 2017-07-13 19:04:03 UTC <Thechildofroth> @JoshThomasCN & what sort of corner is there to negotiate if you want to head in to town along the riverbank from there? Townside would make more sense?
885575179862192132 2017-07-13 19:02:30 UTC <Thechildofroth> @JoshThomasCN Thanks, are there any pics of the scheme as a whole, how do we get on that side of the tracks from the station?

885208591107575808 2017-07-12 18:45:49 UTC <Thechildofroth> @RTaylorUK @GreaterCambs Close Highworth Ave. ~45 households can't be allowed to undermine planning for a whole city / county. Improve Leys/Arbury junction instead.
885197196378984448 2017-07-12 18:00:32 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @RTaylorUK I counted ~45 households on Highworth Ave, even at 2 cars per household that's a drop in the ocean of what comes over that roundabout.

883956179965181952 2017-07-09 07:49:11 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GreaterCambs @RTaylorUK OK, but does that mean that elected reps (representing all of us) have to defer their decisions to the specific interest groups who turn up?

882931885206364160 2017-07-06 11:59:00 UTC <Thechildofroth> @po8crg Ok, got ya, thanks. Return to RPI only and floating threshold will be a good start getting rid of the cost bell curve is much harder fo'sure
882851462627426305 2017-07-05 06:39:25 UTC <Thechildofroth> @po8crg SLC figures are off because (IMO) they're overvaluing the book for re-sale. Also see 'Discount rate' adjustment in 2015 policy.
882846766898589697 2017-07-05 06:20:46 UTC <Thechildofroth> @po8crg Paid in total = Principal + Interest or just Principal?   I'm not seeing how you get from 'Paid in total' to 'only pay 2%'   2% of what?
882675522022637568 2017-07-05 19:00:18 UTC <Thechildofroth> Many of us also ride the full length of Elizabeth Way and yet there seems to be no plan for that concrete shit gutter #greenthebridgehttps://twitter.com/MiltonRoadRA/status/882667229682311169

882633386875117568 2017-07-05 16:12:52 UTC <Thechildofroth> @po8crg The trick will be to work out a loan repayment system with an upward taper, rather than current bell curve where the middle get screwed
882632885211213824 2017-07-05 16:10:53 UTC <Thechildofroth> @po8crg Cool, but I think your assertion that a tax would prevent tax havens is flawed.
882632485733113861 2017-07-05 16:09:17 UTC <Thechildofroth> @po8crg They're also capable of offshoring their income and assets (CF Panama) no one seems to have a handle on preventing continued tax evasion
882622991607230464 2017-07-05 15:31:34 UTC <Thechildofroth> @po8crg Given that the system stands to recoup somewhere between 40 - 75% of 'loans' made, folk repaying in total is the least of our worries!
882622533463400449 2017-07-05 15:29:44 UTC <Thechildofroth> @po8crg Tax on contractual basis kinda like a loan? You're advocating what we have already. This should be an argument of detail not ideology...
882621912526049281 2017-07-05 15:27:16 UTC <Thechildofroth> What we have already is a micro-hypothocated tax system it's just that the tories have screwed the fair / progressive details out of it.
882621263331684354 2017-07-05 15:24:42 UTC <Thechildofroth> Keep loans (+ bring back means tested maintenance grant) raise threshold with inflation & calculate income tax after repayment is deducted

852247025328500737 2017-04-12 19:48:19 UTC <Thechildofroth> @seanjcoughlan seems they've descended in to a talk-shop rather than become the economic black panthers.. #rollingjubileehttps://twitter.com/0debtzone/status/852228121134866433
852242661411086337 2017-04-12 19:30:59 UTC <Thechildofroth> @seanjcoughlan Don't think so, but its just an idea so if @nusuk or someone picked it up it'd do more than pissing and moaning about interest rates.
852164027681734658 2017-04-12 14:18:31 UTC <Thechildofroth> Never a better time for a #rollingjubilee on UK student debt, could be bought for pennies in the pound and written down.https://twitter.com/seanjcoughlan/status/852156220328857600
852150898025537536 2017-04-12 13:26:20 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Amelia_Womack Freezing the threshold was a real stitch up, the new tapers are too, as is the simultaneous calc of income tax and loan repayment figures.
852150308805505024 2017-04-12 13:24:00 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Amelia_Womack Should also be noted that changes to the interest rate have no effect on repayments (fixed at 9% of earnings over 21k) #misguidedcomplaints
852149291187613696 2017-04-12 13:19:57 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Amelia_Womack err, it's not RPI+3 it's RPI+up to 3, dependent on income (need to earn 41k or more for it to be RPI+3) #straightfacts #hype #nonsense
851869899848810496 2017-04-11 18:49:45 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Puffles2010 @gnomeicide Sure, this is part of what I've gotpic.twitter.com/tBsPbasA9n
851867338358042624 2017-04-11 18:39:35 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Puffles2010 @gnomeicide I'd not done any further research before but it all seems to corroborate with this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterton_Hall
851865762637774848 2017-04-11 18:33:19 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Puffles2010 @gnomeicide Got to work out how to scan it, its the ownership history of 'Hall Farm' from 1897 to its sale to Cambs Corp (by St John) in '47 (for 52k)
851783802473119744 2017-04-11 13:07:38 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Puffles2010 @gnomeicide I'll see what I can do, the most interesting bits aren't an issue as they cover a far wider area than my measly patch!
851781494435610625 2017-04-11 12:58:28 UTC <Thechildofroth> @gnomeicide I note @Puffles2010 is doing history atm, I have some docs with my deeds re manor farm, from which the history of the estate can be decerned
851780983636598784 2017-04-11 12:56:26 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Puffles2010 @gnomeicide Kingsway itself is fine, it's just in the wrong place / not sympathetic to the 'garden city' type layout of the original estate.
851779257344958466 2017-04-11 12:49:34 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Puffles2010 @gnomeicide Yeah, the original Arbury layup is good too, not sure what possessed whoever it was that signed off dropping Kingsway in the middle of it?
851776930638639104 2017-04-11 12:40:20 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Puffles2010 @gnomeicide IMO the original bit of KH is actually masterfully planned, lots of parking but lots of quiet green spaces too, shame folk are such snobs.
851776705610043393 2017-04-11 12:39:26 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Puffles2010 @gnomeicide They really missed a trick not putting KH rd in an underpass and blending OP with Buchan st (and the lovely 'Pulley' park)

823560387132084224 2017-01-23 15:57:51 UTC <Thechildofroth> @AskSeagate suggests on email they're ok with personal cloud sending out 3.5k unauthorised DNS requests to non seagate properties, really?!

822481415644315648 2017-01-20 16:30:25 UTC <Thechildofroth> @Seagate NAS is ddossing websites @AskSeagate won't answer my questions, nor will any other support channel #shitservice #shitproduct RT
822480708136472577 2017-01-20 16:27:36 UTC <Thechildofroth> @AskSeagate this is ridiculous, how is anyone in employment meant to get support? No response to webform and a call centre 7-4 weekdays

822126335082594304 2017-01-19 16:59:27 UTC <Thechildofroth> @AskSeagate Which number am I supposed to use to get through the fact that this NAS makes 700 requests a day to site you don't own?
820601199049183236 2017-01-15 11:59:06 UTC <Thechildofroth> @GeorgeMonbiot @AndreuEscriva Is it really 30 cheaper to go to Malaga than get a train to Brum?! British public transport FTW! ;-)

819870207795662849 2017-01-13 11:34:24 UTC <Thechildofroth> @AskSeagate Why does my personal cloud keep polling DNS requests to HP, Apple, Microsoft and http://GNU.org?
819850239268032512 2017-01-13 10:15:03 UTC <Thechildofroth> @HenryPryor Or move north or to Wales and do it for nearly half that, the southeast should be the making of the rest of the country.
