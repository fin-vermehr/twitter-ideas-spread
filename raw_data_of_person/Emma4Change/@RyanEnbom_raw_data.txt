Also, zygotes aren't babies. Most aborted fetuses look closer to chickens than humans and you'd know that if you read the average 7th grade biology textbook.
963957216645730304 2018-02-14 02:04:44 UTC <RyanEnbom> @ParkerMolloy Brainstorm: Create a bathroom solely for "good guys with guns." All the bigots/gun owners kill each other. #2birds
962201354763685889 2018-02-09 05:47:34 UTC <RyanEnbom> @premierleague Sounds like @EASPORTSFIFA needs to reevaluate his low 70's rating
961958015795695617 2018-02-09 13:40:37 UTC <RyanEnbom> @SoccerInsider @MWaner19 @sglueckert According to both, they were the first 2 to start these kinds of talks. I believe this was said on their specials for @TotalSoccerShow, but you may find it elsewhere too with all the coverage.
961840763955851265 2018-02-08 05:54:42 UTC <RyanEnbom> @SoccerInsider @MWaner19 Goff's first tweet in this thread is about candidates "seeking to unite." So, it doesn't seem they're arguing "pick one of 6." In fact, it seems like the opposite and that change candidates may be willing to support each other in order to defeat the establishment.
961833087951712261 2018-02-08 05:24:12 UTC <RyanEnbom> @SoccerInsider @MWaner19 Really? Seems more like the first step in consolidation and unification to me. Martino even said earlier this week that he's had conversations with several candidates sharing ideas and discussing these kinds of ideas

960681880763985925 2018-02-05 01:09:43 UTC <RyanEnbom> @mattoak Oh my god thank you. I couldn't figure out why I liked the pattern but not the kit
958879500846141440 2018-01-31 01:47:42 UTC <RyanEnbom> Hey @TotalSoccerShow, just your friendly East-Side Milwaukee listener checking in to validate @TBRock00's "corner store" analogy. All the best!
958680885091553281 2018-01-31 12:38:29 UTC <RyanEnbom> @alanhinton11 @turneresq @Dudesbee @wbinfo61 LOL is right Mr. 75%pic.twitter.com/dIddnUGfWb
957735413036277760 2018-01-28 22:01:30 UTC <RyanEnbom> @shinguardian @SuperUnionNova Yes! Martino shoulders the majority of duties and is the clean face while Wynalda is the bulldog who gets things done behind the scenes. Match made in political soccer heaven.
957622088969474049 2018-01-28 14:31:12 UTC <RyanEnbom> @alanhinton11 Even Arthur Laffer argued that trickle down only works if corporate tax rates remain in the middle or high percentiles. The new effective corporate tax rate will be around 20%... far below the necessary standards for trickle down. Great for lining the pockets of the rich though.
957620944926846976 2018-01-28 14:26:39 UTC <RyanEnbom> @alanhinton11 Trickle down absolutely does NOT work. History has proven so time and time again. The one exception was the Reagan era and there are plenty of caveats to explain this. Also, Reagan began the deregulation of banks which snowballed over years into the 2008 Financial Crisis.
956683601520812033 2018-01-25 00:21:59 UTC <RyanEnbom> @davisjsn Preki, that dude calls it like he sees it ha.
955160737558691841 2018-01-21 19:30:40 UTC <RyanEnbom> @moviegoer74 Yeah and Carrillo doesn't seem like the answer. Would've loved Bakambu but he's off to China
955140442965921792 2018-01-21 18:10:01 UTC <RyanEnbom> @moviegoer74 Saints play centrally in the attacking third is poor all around :/. We really need to conjure up a striker with that Van Dijk money.
954966252077842432 2018-01-20 06:37:51 UTC <RyanEnbom> @alanhinton11 C'mon coach, everyone and their mother knows Republicans took CHIPS as a "hostage" and pinned it against DACA. Deporting thousands vs. killing thousands is a Sophie's Choice no one can sort out.

949299493425569798 2018-01-05 15:20:11 UTC <RyanEnbom> @shinguardian Ohhh right, so he'd be forced to enter the lottery and could end up playing for like Miami Fusion or Chivas USA as long as they offer him change for the bus.
949297424887099393 2018-01-05 15:11:57 UTC <RyanEnbom> @shinguardian But wouldn't it be more financially sound to wait till the 2nd round of the Targeted Supplemental Returning Players Expansion Draft?
945895601190907904 2017-12-26 05:54:19 UTC <RyanEnbom> @SteveNash Love this! Tried to explain Harry Kane's relevance to my dad earlier and my comment was, "He's the Steve Nash of the Premier League." Wasn't naturally gifted, but worked harder than everyone else to be one of the best.
942760272284045314 2017-12-18 14:15:39 UTC <RyanEnbom> So fascinating and provides clarity for what we've all been observing, but unable to articulate so expertly.http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials/
940056439099240448 2017-12-10 03:11:35 UTC <RyanEnbom> Roughly 8 years ago, I was looking to become a fan of my 1st pro soccer team. I turned on ESPN to see @OzzieAlonso put in a tough tackle on a Galaxy midfielder (I like to remember it as Beckham). That solidified my fandom and I've been Rave Green since. #6forever
940054720785260544 2017-12-10 03:04:45 UTC <RyanEnbom> @mattoak But that might mean that total clarity and transparency in all proceedings would make the most sense. And we all know THAT can't be true.
939636421228400640 2017-12-09 23:22:35 UTC <RyanEnbom> @decloet Ha a more than fair point. And a well deserved win, congrats, you did it second 
939620799425728512 2017-12-09 22:20:30 UTC <RyanEnbom> @decloet Hey, looks just like last year. Remind me, how did that go again?
939604143970443264 2017-12-09 21:14:19 UTC <RyanEnbom> @mattoak I think the first semester student segments we do in T.V. Production school go smoother than that did.
939602334212087809 2017-12-09 21:07:08 UTC <RyanEnbom> @decloet Ha! They didn't even need a shot on target to win last year Shouldn't be too difficult second time around.
939599354146578432 2017-12-09 20:55:17 UTC <RyanEnbom> The paranoid sports fan in me wants me to be cautious, but damn it just feels like Seattle's day! #MLSCup
938412826099625984 2017-12-06 14:20:27 UTC <RyanEnbom> @danharmon A few of us tried the whole kool-aid thing, but someone "Britta'd" it and forgot the cyanide.
934253785890918401 2017-11-24 02:53:54 UTC <RyanEnbom> @NosAudietis Why though? Not saying I wouldn't love it, but wouldn't recent history suggest Gus back and Delem in midfield?
931340142606016512 2017-11-16 01:56:08 UTC <RyanEnbom> @RepKinzinger I do hope you'll update us on all these jobs the tax code "creates." Every bit of recent precedent shows that trickle-down doesn't lead to new jobs. And here I would've thought you learned something in my aunt's social studies class years ago.
930246342697463808 2017-11-13 01:29:45 UTC <RyanEnbom> @NosAudietis Would you like to see Bruin starting not only b/c of his form this season, but specifically b/c Seattle plays Houston? Seems like a man with a chip on his shoulder, but in the motivating way.
927594262937657344 2017-11-06 17:51:20 UTC <RyanEnbom> @kylemartino Whether you're successful or not, I really hope your platform defines the tone of this race and whoever is elected is held to its standard.
927354581121732608 2017-11-05 01:58:56 UTC <RyanEnbom> @mattoak That's very apt. Either game will be punch in the gut stuff, but Portland will play a game at least.
927353764528263168 2017-11-05 01:55:41 UTC <RyanEnbom> @mattoak And Houston has that "rough n' tumble, dumb luck" feel about them. Historically, that's Sounders kryptonite :/

924319320804679680 2017-10-28 16:57:53 UTC <RyanEnbom> @johniadarola Yeah, but only cus the Ewoks wanted a candidate from outside the mainstream. It had nothing to do with anti-jawa sentiment, right?
924101385611890688 2017-10-27 02:31:53 UTC <RyanEnbom> Today, I am thankful for @ParkerMolloy's thread for reminding me there's always something good going on in the world.

918564096756338688 2017-10-12 19:48:41 UTC <RyanEnbom> @RepBrendanBoyle Yeah! Just like no one watches the Super Bowl if their team isn't in it, right? Or the World Series, or the NBA Finals, or the... wait.
917814149794627584 2017-10-10 18:08:40 UTC <RyanEnbom> Exposure is an effective tool against negative stigma. So, on #WorldMentalHealthDay, I want to say that I've been to therapy & it helped me.

903617252842512384 2017-09-01 13:55:16 UTC <RyanEnbom> @Onision @Chriiissttiine @nyashro @jack_jaxter @nuaimsham1 Like what makes you believe in a god? Just a personal feeling? Or has he descended from the heavens just to chill out with you before?
903616897584959488 2017-09-01 13:53:51 UTC <RyanEnbom> @Onision @Chriiissttiine @nyashro @jack_jaxter @nuaimsham1 Ok fair enough, broken clocks are right twice a day and "Thou shalt not kill" seems reasonable. But again, where do you get your proof?

903497517786030081 2017-08-31 05:59:29 UTC <RyanEnbom> @Onision @Chriiissttiine @nyashro @jack_jaxter @nuaimsham1 I do want to reaffirm that I mean this all as good natured debate btw. My intention is not to insult or hate, but to understand.

903493987964641282 2017-08-31 05:45:27 UTC <RyanEnbom> @Onision @Chriiissttiine @nyashro @jack_jaxter Idk what @nuaimsham1 meant so I won't comment there. But don't you think god is homophobic if he destroyed Sodom b/c its citizens were gay?

902993078507667456 2017-08-30 20:35:01 UTC <RyanEnbom> @Onision @Chriiissttiine @nyashro @jack_jaxter Lol no worries  she's a lot prettier than I am, I'll take the compliment.
902992780288512001 2017-08-30 20:33:50 UTC <RyanEnbom> @Onision @Chriiissttiine @nyashro @jack_jaxter Those are the only 2 options unless you agree you have no logical basis to believe in a god that loves everyone but choose to anyway.
902992444811337728 2017-08-30 20:32:30 UTC <RyanEnbom> @Onision @Chriiissttiine @nyashro @jack_jaxter Ok but what leads you to believe those things? You said research, but what research doesn't produce evidence in support or to the contrary?

902990413056933888 2017-08-30 20:24:25 UTC <RyanEnbom> @Onision @nyashro @jack_jaxter @Chriiissttiine Yeaaaah you should continue reading on in that particular chapter. You'll find plenty of bigotry and hatred just in that one.
902989319861932032 2017-08-30 20:20:05 UTC <RyanEnbom> @Onision @Chriiissttiine @nyashro @jack_jaxter But where do you get that idea then? What evidence would suggest to you that a god would love any one of us let alone every one?

897538452467720193 2017-08-15 19:20:17 UTC <RyanEnbom> Not to mention frustrating, abhorrent, and un-American too
897537499131781122 2017-08-15 19:16:29 UTC <RyanEnbom> It's disheartening that we from "the land of the free" must constantly debate just who that applies to. #DefendDACA #Charlottesville
896532581503516672 2017-08-12 00:43:18 UTC <RyanEnbom> @NationofChange @zdroberts Sad thing is @USAGSessions would probably call this righteous retaliation for all of the (zero times) white people were oppressed in the US.
894591843681390594 2017-08-07 16:11:30 UTC <RyanEnbom> @realDonaldTrump Draining the swamp, and it was all a lie. He behaves like a baby and will beg for Robert Muller's forgiveness. And yes there was collusion.
894590669087539207 2017-08-07 16:06:50 UTC <RyanEnbom> @realDonaldTrump Never in U.S. History as anyone lied and defrauded voters more than President Donald Trump. He told stories about inauguration crowds and...
893753753203077120 2017-08-05 08:41:14 UTC <RyanEnbom> @kennyloggins Creativity, sexual themes, AND a famous comedic reference... It's everything @midnight and more in a final (ish) tweet. #thanks@midnight
893268888338681856 2017-08-03 00:34:33 UTC <RyanEnbom> @alanhinton11 Maybe they listened to his complaints and stopped covering "alternative facts" laden content
886751167459577862 2017-07-16 00:55:28 UTC <RyanEnbom> @TotalSoccerShow That's quite alright, I'll just be hitting refresh for the remaining 28 hours. Much love guys!

886239074243276800 2017-07-15 15:00:35 UTC <RyanEnbom> @VP @MatthewDicks @mjviking2000 @CarBar196902 The cognitive dissonance required to "not believe" what can be factually proven...It's almost as if you GOP'ers enjoy turning the blind eye.
885331483984109568 2017-07-12 02:54:09 UTC <RyanEnbom> @AmericanOutlaws Everyone likes to give the benefit of the doubt but wow, he couldn't have been more wrong if @JmoSmooth13 was on the US half
885324551344750593 2017-07-12 02:26:36 UTC <RyanEnbom> @washingtonpost @jmickspike Yes! Anything that anyone living had tried was fair game once they lied to you about it
885324238403588100 2017-07-12 02:25:21 UTC <RyanEnbom> @washingtonpost The fact that most D.A.R.E. officers consistently lied about drugs (marijuana) squandered the program's limited credibility with students.

879396904311894016 2017-06-26 17:52:15 UTC <RyanEnbom> @TotalSoccerShow Will Roldan play? If so, what position in midfield? Or is he just being brought along "for the experience?"
877978354867093505 2017-06-22 19:55:26 UTC <RyanEnbom> @TBRock00 Yes! This is exactly the nonsense Anchorman 2 lampooned so effectively.

864578802135035906 2017-05-16 20:30:24 UTC <RyanEnbom> @TotalSoccerShow @SouthamptonFC only needs a few pieces to be in contention for Europa again. Puel's tactics part of wins this year & not a cause of problems
863605415166259201 2017-05-13 04:02:30 UTC <RyanEnbom> @LikkitP I hate to beat the league's most dead horse, but a true, dribbly, pacey winger would be a massive improvement

861734794715123713 2017-05-08 00:09:19 UTC <RyanEnbom> @NosAudietis ... in the middle anyway. Couple that with the lack of right back choices and the sounders don't seem to have any right wing width.
861734474593259520 2017-05-08 00:08:03 UTC <RyanEnbom> @NosAudietis I know I've asked this before, but do you really think Nico is more effective on the wing? I'm starting to disagree. He ends up in the
860977666559803392 2017-05-06 22:00:46 UTC <RyanEnbom> @SoundersPowWow How about Marrufo for handing out only one yellow to a TFC player? Cooper, Bradley, Altidore, and Morrow all deserving.

853401289937604612 2017-04-15 00:14:57 UTC <RyanEnbom> @VABVOX I don't completely disagree with you, but it's certainly understandable.
853401062140772352 2017-04-15 00:14:03 UTC <RyanEnbom> @VABVOX In all fairness... can you blame him? It's been proven the primaries weren't a fair playing field for him. That's a bitter pill to swallow.
853332394153324546 2017-04-15 19:41:11 UTC <RyanEnbom> @Slate The one thing he and Bannon can find common ground on... Vampirism.
851569568808144896 2017-04-10 22:56:21 UTC <RyanEnbom> @SoundersPowWow Ask the Pow Wow: In other MLS related news... Are the Fire a leigit playoff team this year? Or is this the Schweinsteiger bump?
850918723921874945 2017-04-08 03:50:07 UTC <RyanEnbom> @mattoak I unfortunately can't watch the game, but I already know that I agree
850113508318605316 2017-04-06 22:30:29 UTC <RyanEnbom> @johniadarola Don't forget blind malice and a 99.8% DNA match with Jabba the Hutt
848686774306123776 2017-04-02 00:01:09 UTC <RyanEnbom> @TotalSoccerShow Why Schweinsteiger does NOT fit the "retirement league" stereotype. Paunovic quotes about the impact on practice are revealing.
848027682315153408 2017-03-31 04:22:09 UTC <RyanEnbom> @mattoak Agreed. It's really difficult to admit that the best first half this year so far was in a 0-0 draw
846469117834117128 2017-03-27 21:08:58 UTC <RyanEnbom> @NosAudietis Also, do you think Lodeiro needs to play in the center to be more effective? Or is he better suited out wide?
846468753172975617 2017-03-27 21:07:32 UTC <RyanEnbom> @NosAudietis If you had to pick 1 to start every MLS game for the rest of the season, Flacco or Shipp?
844567286526697473 2017-03-22 15:11:47 UTC <RyanEnbom> @AndyKimy Hmm, Secretary of Tremendousness or General of the Internet? His lack of experience is unparalleled tho, so maybe he replaces Rex.
842742422748717056 2017-03-17 14:20:25 UTC <RyanEnbom> @AndyKimy @ryanrousseau But also making a list of people that do, for when he runs out of his current targets.

840970602588573697 2017-03-12 16:59:50 UTC <RyanEnbom> @SoundersPowWow You're the best! Think I'm gonna get a refund too and reinvest in MLS Live instead
840729653027454976 2017-03-11 01:02:23 UTC <RyanEnbom> @comcast @thesoccerdon @MLS @FunkyBacon Fair enough, still on the TV listing, but I'll retract that complaint.
840728884475748352 2017-03-11 00:59:20 UTC <RyanEnbom> Hey @SoundersPowWow Know any back channels I can catch the game on in IL? It's blacked out... In Illinois. Counting on J's dark arts here.
840728400507654144 2017-03-11 00:57:25 UTC <RyanEnbom> @comcast @thesoccerdon @MLS Also #NEvORL  blacked out along with #MTLvSEA... Illinois is not logically in any of these markets. Please help.

838204208142778368 2017-03-04 01:47:10 UTC <RyanEnbom> @MLS please explain #HOUvSEA blackout in Illinois. Been a loyal fan 4 almost a decade & this is the 1st time I've been an unhappy customer.

821867839816667141 2017-01-18 23:52:17 UTC <RyanEnbom> @alfranken @jaymurphy70 Well I'm glad I'm on board for the fantastic political half of his career.
821853131185225730 2017-01-18 22:53:50 UTC <RyanEnbom> Not only does he work for his constituents, but he works to uphold truly progressive ideals. Just look at questioning of DeVos. #4ThePeople

798041508536430592 2016-11-13 05:54:57 UTC <RyanEnbom> @mattoak It's almost like electing the first black president, and then electing the KKK's preferred candidate right after #whoops

790749051562196992 2016-10-24 02:57:19 UTC <RyanEnbom> @moviegoer74 Haha I'll chalk that up to all of these cyber attacks, cus why not? Oh & thanks 2 Europa, Saints on nat'l TV 3 times this week!

787795594077171712 2016-10-16 23:21:20 UTC <RyanEnbom> @JeremiahOshan Well whether we agree here or not, it's still deflating :/ #SadSounderDay
787794941770604544 2016-10-16 23:18:45 UTC <RyanEnbom> Congratulations to Mark Geiger for winning the Supporters Shield, just a brilliant sham of a performance today  #DALvSEA #SoundersMatchday
787794075017703424 2016-10-16 23:15:18 UTC <RyanEnbom> @JeremiahOshan That's a loose definition for "push." Dallas made such a meal out of that, the whole stadium is going home with leftovers.
787792282682585088 2016-10-16 23:08:11 UTC <RyanEnbom> @JeremiahOshan hard to call that a foul... I think Geiger needs to rethink his approach to this entire game. Total lack of consistency

786416671053455360 2016-10-12 04:01:59 UTC <RyanEnbom> @sounderatheart what are your thoughts as to the fairness of this call? I could be wrong, but I thought Ozzie tried to help him up at first.
786050339103510528 2016-10-11 03:46:19 UTC <RyanEnbom> @AlexiLalas I think you give Clint the game, start Jozy, and if he's ineffective, pull for Wood at half.
785308342398783490 2016-10-09 02:37:53 UTC <RyanEnbom> Trump is beyond respect, he's not lived a moment of his business or public life for anyone but his insecure, and irresponsible self #debate
780581181444136960 2016-09-26 01:33:50 UTC <RyanEnbom> Trump taking speech lessons from "Robot" Marco Rubio apparently. #debates #debatenight
774694433254215681 2016-09-10 19:42:00 UTC <RyanEnbom> @moviegoer74 he's been saints most underwhelming player 4 some time now IMO. Even when he was "in form" things were put on a platter for him
771538325400236034 2016-09-01 02:40:45 UTC <RyanEnbom> @NosAudietis if the Sounders were forced to pick up a contributor to Sounder at Heart, who would they sign?
771140647428427776 2016-08-31 00:20:32 UTC <RyanEnbom> @moviegoer74 well worded sir, Saints' strength the past few years has been the TEAM. Hence the success, despite the key losses #saintsfc
769035942535528449 2016-08-25 04:57:11 UTC <RyanEnbom> @JonahNaill I wish Twitter had the ability to retweet to the 1000th power, b/c that would be 1/2 way close to how strongly I feel this lmao
764990229547810816 2016-08-14 01:00:58 UTC <RyanEnbom> @RealSaltLake @TaylorTwellman ..."while bouncing it (the ball) on the ground, or throwing it in the air." Ball didnt touch before Mov did.
764989907110621184 2016-08-14 00:59:41 UTC <RyanEnbom> @RealSaltLake @TaylorTwellman according to page 83 of FIFA's laws and Law 12 of the ref's handbook, a goalkeeper is considered in possesion
764986870552035328 2016-08-14 00:47:37 UTC <RyanEnbom> @SoundersPowWow Hope Johnathan weighs in on the bogus RSL goal,simply a Google search would tell anyone that the ref made a mistake #SEAvRSL
762122358677237760 2016-08-06 03:05:04 UTC <RyanEnbom> @GrantWahl as a former employee of H&M, I'm slightly offended... although, as a former employee, I totally get your point :D #FastFashion
758446873355096064 2016-07-27 23:40:00 UTC <RyanEnbom> @IDOT_Illinois oh and not a single detour provided either
758446540910424064 2016-07-27 23:38:41 UTC <RyanEnbom> @IDOT_Illinois should warn ppl about this outrageous delay on 80. Over an hour to make it 2 miles + only one warning sign halfway through it
756232075926208513 2016-07-21 20:59:11 UTC <RyanEnbom> @NosAudietis If there was one Sounders move in MLS franchise history you could undo, not including Oba's move, what would it be?
755790557457190914 2016-07-20 15:44:45 UTC <RyanEnbom> Well done on the AM Gist Mr @pescami! Few radio hosts have the gravitas and poetic professionalism you do, & none inspire me to write more.
752254538938068992 2016-07-10 21:33:52 UTC <RyanEnbom> Gotta give props to @black_mamba0007 for calling the #Por win back in March #PORFRA
749061558450266112 2016-07-01 02:06:07 UTC <RyanEnbom> whoops, *in haha
749061487264567296 2016-07-01 02:05:50 UTC <RyanEnbom> *cough, runs on the family :D
748606818448867332 2016-06-30 19:59:08 UTC <RyanEnbom> @NosAudietis Is Garth already vetting new coaches for next season?
748570345788018688 2016-06-30 17:34:12 UTC <RyanEnbom> @jacobokeson thanks buddy :D love you too
748570170893963268 2016-06-30 17:33:31 UTC <RyanEnbom> @jacobokeson Armrests are for those who have already earned their way Jacob! You can hold your arms up, teaches mental fortitude 
748568610298281984 2016-06-30 17:27:19 UTC <RyanEnbom> @jacobokeson lmao just a design flaw or did your parents take those too?
747622626911203328 2016-06-27 02:48:19 UTC <RyanEnbom> Bereft of purpose, @GrantWahl began wandering the countryside after that tweet, in search of the land of endless soccer broadcasts #Legend
746368099348185088 2016-06-24 15:43:16 UTC <RyanEnbom> @moviegoer74 dice would've definitely been the safer move. But, with the Euro this year, maybe we'll grab a departing NT manager.
746367747991306244 2016-06-24 15:41:52 UTC <RyanEnbom> @moviegoer74 Well at least the Board has progress in mind, but long term manager deals seem unrealistic in modern football, rolling the...
746365065318785025 2016-06-24 15:31:13 UTC <RyanEnbom> @moviegoer74 oh I know :( and I still don't get the Everton choice. It wasn't like Koeman was overstaying his welcome.
746175444991492096 2016-06-23 02:57:44 UTC <RyanEnbom> Nice to hear ya on @PremierPunditry again @moviegoer74! Looking forward to next season!
733037586097307648 2016-05-18 20:52:34 UTC <RyanEnbom> Is Southampton still likely to lose Sadio Mane in the summer time? #FCExtraTime
732575307346116610 2016-05-17 14:15:38 UTC <RyanEnbom> Happy Birthday @jamiekilstein! I can't afford a gift or donation right now :( but I want you to know you make a difference every day for me!
721804330446254082 2016-04-17 20:55:37 UTC <RyanEnbom> @SoccerByIves nice to see someone else neutral agrees! Simple foul, simple call.
719343983378366465 2016-04-10 01:59:05 UTC <RyanEnbom> @davisjsn If you mean Van Damme... Then yeah what the hell? Oniel Fisher earned an early shower for the same or less vs KC
714534466144702464 2016-03-28 19:27:46 UTC <RyanEnbom> @morganArseCan Sorry we're all just projecting at this point #StayCalmStayCalmStayCalmStayCalm
711657882316632065 2016-03-20 20:57:15 UTC <RyanEnbom> @alanhinton11 I don't even think that was a trick... He simply made a mistake and was rewarded for it by an incompetent referee. #GeigerShow
710148548168273921 2016-03-16 16:59:42 UTC <RyanEnbom> Glad to see @democracynow continues to step up with real, whole, and inclusive coverage. It's sickening that major media ignores @SenSanders
707957069836582913 2016-03-10 15:51:33 UTC <RyanEnbom> @andrew_wiebe @MLS @ExtraTimeRadio let me rephrase... Why make the *distinction, between the two?
707956693951488001 2016-03-10 15:50:03 UTC <RyanEnbom> @andrew_wiebe @MLS @ExtraTimeRadio Why make the separation between "Targeted Allocation" and "General Allocation?"
703649150013939712 2016-02-27 18:33:25 UTC <RyanEnbom> @jacobokeson #MyFirstAmbition
703392324219379712 2016-02-26 01:32:53 UTC <RyanEnbom> So bummed I can't catch my hero @davisjsn in Chicago this weekend! Missed you by a day #legend
700435813281075200 2016-02-18 21:44:46 UTC <RyanEnbom> Seriously, everyone involved with @broadcity, you're the best! #4and3and...
700165734253486080 2016-02-17 03:51:34 UTC <RyanEnbom> @mattoak Gerard created that contact tho, he cuts in front of Marshall and runs his shoulder into him too. I see the refs point
695803531731795968 2016-02-05 02:57:44 UTC <RyanEnbom> @shinguardian Is this because of a lack of faith in Birnbaum's defending, Bingham in the air? Why the right wing?
695454458709344257 2016-02-04 03:50:38 UTC <RyanEnbom> Love it on the latest @PremierPunditry Mr. @moviegoer74! Pulling no punches! #SaintSuperior #saintsfc
693301715290947584 2016-01-29 05:16:24 UTC <RyanEnbom> @davisjsn That'll be where NYCFC moves in 2025 after the Yankees evict them.
