970103643134308352 2018-03-03 01:08:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> "Two Mules For Sister Sara," which is arguably the most underrated western ever made, is on @STARZ.

969328656605626368 2018-03-01 21:48:55 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AmyNovondo I'll be watching, like always!
969081204812087297 2018-02-28 05:25:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles Also, this episode certainly puts a new spin on the drone promotion, organized by @gofooji and @swagbyfox, for the season premiere in January.
969080958216421376 2018-02-28 05:24:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles Brilliant episode. Top-notch writing from @kristenclokem and Shannon Hamblin, as well as Emmy-worthy directing by Glen Morgan. This season has, at least, two episodes that deserve nominations: "Plus One" for @KarinKonoval's guest role and this one for Morgan's directing.
969060047857664001 2018-02-28 04:01:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ComedyCentralPR @usatodaylife I said that after I watched the first four episodes, which were available on demand before @corporate officially premiered on @ComedyCentral. I'm glad the TV series was renewed for a second season.https://twitter.com/LukeSoroko/status/952029653388021760
969028754172297216 2018-02-28 01:57:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AloneTogether A reference to "Sunset Blvd." Nice. #AloneTogether
969025292311425024 2018-02-28 01:43:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AloneTogether @littleesther Time to for everybody to check if they have limited edition @reeses @ElvisPresley lying around, and put it on @eBay. Maybe it can be sold for nearly $15,000, ala what happened after @McDonalds' "Mulan" Szechuan sauce was mentioned on @RickandMorty. #AloneTogether
965033580043714560 2018-02-17 01:21:49 UTC <LukeSoroko> @SaraJBenincasa I knew I had a long-lost daughter somewhere! But, yeah, @corporate is an excellent TV series! I thoroughly enjoyed that last episode, featuring you and @katewalsh.

962159229372006401 2018-02-09 03:00:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> @OverboardMovie This was probably your most poorly-executed promotion since your inception. Many people (like yours truly) tweeted multiple times, for several hours, and never received a response. @gofoojihelp took hours to reply to DMs, too. You need to take a serious look at your process.

How is it that other people, who have tweeted a couple of minutes ago, have already received links? You're not being transparent about this process.
962072308079710208 2018-02-09 21:14:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> @OverboardMovie @momofthree2017 Me, too. There was no mention of this promotion being restricted to a certain area; so, I don't know what's going on. I've DM'd @gofoojihelp, but all they said is that they're working on it.
962069381311115266 2018-02-09 21:03:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> @gofooji @OverboardMovie Hopefully, this actually works now. A number of us have tweeted #OverboardMovie +  for the past hour, but didn't receive a response.

957059768920825856 2018-01-26 01:16:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk "The Lost Art Of Forehead Sweat" was another brilliant offering. It sent Trump supporters into a frenzy, which is always a good thing.  Also, the last scene with the alien looked like it was filmed on the same location as "Mulholland Dr.," which is fitting, given both narratives.
957059556802269185 2018-01-26 01:15:54 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk Same. Although, he said he was never really fond of "War Of The Coprophages." Personally, that's one of my favorite episodes of #TheXFiles. He was even a little bit critical of "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose," which is almost universally acclaimed.
956409150803664901 2018-01-24 06:11:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DAVID_LYNCH @thexfiles @dblmdl I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that!
956395901479612416 2018-01-24 05:18:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles It was soooooo #PoCo.
956394569137930240 2018-01-24 05:13:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles Can anybody confirm if that scene with the alien handing over "All The Answers" was shot on the same location as @DAVID_LYNCH's "Mulholland Dr."? If so, I can't help but think that was done on purpose, given the narrative of this episode and the movie as well.
956392185888260096 2018-01-24 05:04:00 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XFilesNews It was soooooo #PoCo. #XFForeheadSweat
956386821834813440 2018-01-24 04:42:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DAVID_LYNCH @KyinHI @XFilesNews @AviQuijada Please do. I'd be surprised if that was a coincidence and not a conscience decision. Then again, last week, I had similar feelings regarding @KarinKonoval's character of Chucky. Maybe I'm just reading too much between the lines.
956367950528696320 2018-01-24 03:27:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> @east_coastbias Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the last bit with the alien filmed on the same location as @DAVID_LYNCH's "Mulholland Dr."? If so, that was a genius move, given the narrative of the episode and the movie itself. If you, or anybody, is ever able to interview Darin, please ask.
956363019616796672 2018-01-24 03:08:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> @KyinHI @AviQuijada @XFilesNews Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't that last bit with the alien filmed on the same location as @DAVID_LYNCH's "Mulholland Dr."?

956058962482343938 2018-01-23 06:59:54 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ComedyWorks @sarahtiana Fun fact: Knowshon Moreno blocked me on Twitter. He may have done so by mistake, though, as I've always been complimentary of him. Maybe he doesn't like compliments.  Anyway, if I'm not feeling too lazy later this week, I'll try to catch one of your shows.
956025334549315590 2018-01-23 04:46:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> @CelesteCkStudio Welcome back to Colorado!
956002455203889152 2018-01-23 03:15:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TheAcademy @MoooooooonRiver There have been plenty of instances in which less-than-stellar movies have received acting nominations. Also, Chau only has a bright future if she's given the right opportunities. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't have a good track record in its treatment of Asians.
955968611142676480 2018-01-23 01:00:52 UTC <LukeSoroko> Here's your annual reminder that more white women have won Oscars for racist "yellowface" portrayals of Asian characters than Asian actresses. No Asian actress has been nominated since 1994. That should've ended with Hong Chau, but she was ignored.  Fuck @TheAcademy. #Oscars2018
955967243950551045 2018-01-23 00:55:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk I can't say I'm as thrilled. Hong Chau should've been nominated. No Asian actress has been nominated since 1994. In fact, more white women have won Academy Awards for racist "yellowface" portrayals of Asian characters than actual Asian actresses. @TheAcademy is a disgrace.
955166804258664448 2018-01-21 19:54:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @fandom_ly In my opinion, it's the best episode of the past two seasons, so far. #TheXFiles
954181315326181376 2018-01-18 02:38:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AviQuijada @XFilesNews Thanks for asking @KarinKonoval my question! I got a Gaff and Al Swearengen vibe from Chucky, especially the look. However, I guess that was just a coincidence, and not an influence, as Karin stated. Regardless, she was fantastic and delivered an Emmy-worthy performance!
954122602494087168 2018-01-18 22:45:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> @kimrhodes4real @TheJimMichaels @darcydonavan I'll definitely be watching! I'm a big fan of @cw_spn, too!
954116615259414528 2018-01-18 22:21:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> @LaAlison_Araya_ That was, unquestionably, the best episode of the past two seasons of @thexfiles. You were great!
953860696348835840 2018-01-17 05:24:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XFilesNews Firstly, @KarinKonoval, that was an Emmy-worthy performance. Secondly, Chucky felt like a cross between Gaff on the original @bladerunner and Al Swearengen on "Deadwood," topped off with a Michael J. Anderson-esque voice. Were any of them influences for your character? #AskKarin
953859639623368705 2018-01-17 05:20:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @GillianA I said this elsewhere, but it bears repeating: Tonight's episode was, without a doubt, the best one of the past two seasons. @KarinKonoval should win an Emmy. She gave one of the all-time great guest-starring performances in the entire run of @thexfiles.
953855517021036551 2018-01-17 05:04:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles That was easily the best episode of the past two seasons, so far. @KarinKonoval deserves an Emmy. She was absolutely brilliant.
953854815523651585 2018-01-17 05:01:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XFilesNews I think he did. Could the title "Plus One" also allude to another baby on the way? Just sayin'.
953849219781046273 2018-01-17 04:39:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XFilesNews The real question is: Are they more magical than Agent Einstein's pills?

952789624874704896 2018-01-14 06:28:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @yvonnehew1 That ending, unfortunately, reminded me of the infamous Rahim Moore misplay several years ago. I will never get it out of my head. I still can't believe Denver lost that game to Baltimore!

950952988801081344 2018-01-09 04:50:35 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AmyNovondo I'm still trying to figure out where @YouTube "acted accordingly." The video was up for a day, garnered millions of views, and they did nothing. This is all about their bottom line. If a much lesser known channel did anything remotely similar, it would've already been terminated.
950878937042771969 2018-01-09 23:56:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> @yvonnehew1 I don't know if it's possible to do any worse than Brock Olivo. The special teams were an absolute disaster. They can only go up from here (hopefully).

933448536573689857 2017-11-22 21:34:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GWARofficial @FreshOffABC @chineseguy88 @amelieg @sanjayshah @EricaOyama  Please find a way to bring GWAR on the show next season! Possible premise: Eddie and his friends try to get into a GWAR concert, after obtaining the idea from the "Beavis And Butthead" video game on Super NES. Just a thought!
933167947295596544 2017-11-21 02:59:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Whoa, @GWARofficial on @FreshOffABC?!? Hell to the yes.
931389126112198656 2017-11-16 05:10:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @H_A_kinani You were great on @cw_spn!
930911984299556865 2017-11-15 21:34:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> @KarinKonoval I'm excited to see you back on @thexfiles!
929933245747048449 2017-11-12 04:45:37 UTC <LukeSoroko> @yvonnehew1 Maybe that's the silver lining in all of this. We won't have to indulge in any false optimism this season, as we know the team is garbage. We won't have to worry about our blood pressure as much. We can just sit back, relax, and not get our hopes up with this clown show.
929797060617834496 2017-11-12 19:44:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AmyNovondo Ditto.
928853163012001793 2017-11-09 05:13:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> @LegendsOfGotham @warnerbrostv @FOXTV @GothamAddicts @GothamTVPodcast @GothamFilming @GothamTVWriters @DCComics @myspiritdances You were awesome! I wish we could've seen more of your character. You certainly left your mark!
928137142403923969 2017-11-07 05:48:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> @JasonCicci @CadyDidTVShow @CadyHuffman I'm assuming you have to live in New York City to be an extra on the series, right? Or, how does that work?
927420901473189888 2017-11-05 06:22:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tonight's #CurbYourEnthusiasm was comedy gold, with a number of great guest stars - @andreasavage @edbegleyjr @MsJuneDiane @Elizbethperkins.
927020488957640704 2017-11-04 03:51:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Avalanche Hell of a game!
924505898835329024 2017-10-28 05:19:17 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AmyNovondo I'm watching @Gotham. Are you going to find yourself with a pig's head anytime soon? ;)
923426661940334592 2017-10-25 05:50:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> @gamespot @GSUniverse I did. I even attended the "Gargoyles" reunion panel at @DenverComicCon a couple of years ago.
920547577598111745 2017-10-18 07:10:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @_FaithLogan Angelic (especially with that light)!
919424149981765632 2017-10-14 04:46:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> @YNB @nbcsnl Emmy-worthy performance. That was brilliant.
918691092182138880 2017-10-12 04:13:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> @NerdAlertNews @cw_spn Solid season premiere.
917293437451247616 2017-10-09 07:39:32 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AnneBedian Seeing you on "Curb Your Enthusiasm" again was a real treat!
917284694026199041 2017-10-09 07:04:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GiveTeeLA @HBO @breedawool That was one of the best episodes of the entire TV series! You were great!
915794839085580288 2017-10-04 04:24:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies fall to the @Dbacks, 11-8, in the National League Wild Card Game. Season over.
914273954994561024 2017-09-30 23:41:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> For the first time since 2009, the @Rockies are going to the playoffs! They'll face the @Dbacks in the National League Wild Card Game.
912803371785924608 2017-09-26 22:17:37 UTC <LukeSoroko> Go see the theatrical debut of "Jeepers Creepers 3" tonight! If the movie does well, @RealNickiAycox may appear in the next installment!
908736246041657345 2017-09-15 16:56:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> @RealNickiAycox Will do!
908508028239876097 2017-09-14 01:49:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> @RealNickiAycox Indeed! I wish you were in it, though!
907476028884316160 2017-09-11 05:28:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos opened their regular season with a 24-21 win over the @Chargers. The game ended up being a lot closer than it should've been.
902978546410242048 2017-08-30 19:37:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> The final issue of @IDWPublishing's main @thexfiles comic, written by @joeharris, comes out today. Pick it up.
902710642255085568 2017-08-29 01:52:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> Thanks again, @abarbeau, @justanactor & @JoeyLaurenAdams. I'm glad I met you all at @cscomiccon! That '80s panel with @zwgman was great too!pic.twitter.com/ulvII87ICG
901915915763105792 2017-08-27 21:14:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> I had a blast at @cscomiccon! I attended a couple of panels and met @abarbeau, @justanactor and @JoeyLaurenAdams, who were all very kind.
901155347678679040 2017-08-25 18:52:32 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm off to @cscomiccon!
898677070158413824 2017-08-18 22:44:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> At 6 p.m. MT, on @party934, I'll air my interview with @abarbeau (star of @Daniel_Knauf's "Carnivle"). See her at @cscomiccon next weekend!
896262668163534848 2017-08-11 06:50:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Denverite Nice! How long were you in Denver before moving to Los Angeles?
894398444906741760 2017-08-06 03:23:01 UTC <LukeSoroko> @SHO_TwinPeaks @KelseyBohlen You were great!
892192682830733314 2017-07-31 01:18:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> @SHO_PR @SHO_TwinPeaks @zmclane I very much enjoyed it!  You certainly had a memorable scene. #TurkeyJerky
890080955372781568 2017-07-25 05:26:51 UTC <LukeSoroko> @kathrynmalia I concur! Hell, I may actually sign up for @netflix if it picked up @iamalmostasian. Right now, I just get my media needs from the library.
886783640348360704 2017-07-16 03:04:30 UTC <LukeSoroko> @LaLloronadeLA Your performance on @SHO_TwinPeaks was breathtaking. I got chills listening to your amazing voice.
886751893778812928 2017-07-16 00:58:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> Get ready for the season seven premiere of @GameOfThrones on @HBO! #WinterIsHere
886350794781577218 2017-07-15 22:24:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia Nice!
886040508010811392 2017-07-14 01:51:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia If you want to see one of the biggest influences on George Lucas and @starwars, check out Kurosawa's "The Hidden Fortress."
886040244319121408 2017-07-14 01:50:30 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia As far as Kurosawa goes, he was the master of jidaigeki films, which have been major influences on all sorts of directors.
886039857319030785 2017-07-14 01:48:58 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia However, I'd argue "Once Upon A Time In The West" is Leone's best film. In fact, I'd argue it's the best film ever made.
886039719871729666 2017-07-14 01:48:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" is the last film in "The Man With No Name Trilogy," and it's Leone's most well-known film.
886039361388675072 2017-07-14 01:47:00 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia The first film in "The Man With No Name Trilogy" is "A Fistful Of Dollars," which is basically a recreation of Kurosawa's "Yojimbo."
886039096631623680 2017-07-14 01:45:57 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia Leone was the master of the spaghetti western (my favorite film genre). Directed "The Man With No Name Trilogy" a.k.a. "The Dollars Trilogy"
886035617053896704 2017-07-14 01:32:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk Alfred Hitchcock is one of the three greatest directors of all-time, in my opinion (the other two being Sergio Leone and Akira Kurosawa).
885712016769392640 2017-07-13 04:06:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TomEScott @andreasavage @truTV @HelloLyndon I just finished watching the third episode, on demand. Friggen hilarious! #ImSorryTV #AssCubes
885346745508560896 2017-07-12 03:54:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> @truTV @andreasavage I very much enjoyed it! I'm now cognizant of "jalapeo hands." #ImSorryTV #TheMoreYouKnow
884504699134775296 2017-07-10 20:08:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> @joeharris I would definitely buy one if I could be there (or online, perhaps?). I've purchased every issue, and nearly every cover, of the comic.
884149136337117188 2017-07-09 20:35:55 UTC <LukeSoroko> @danielwuyanzu @latimes @MorganicInk I just got blocked by @PLenkov for mentioning the article. That says more about him than anything else.
884134231429042176 2017-07-09 19:36:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @danielwuyanzu @latimes @MorganicInk That was an excellent article. Hopefully, @PLenkov reads it. The explanation he gave on @CBS' @HawaiiFive0CBS controversy was insulting.
882060076256808960 2017-07-03 02:14:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> @julieannemery Have you been singing for a long time, or did you just start getting into it for @PreacherAMC?
882058467913105410 2017-07-03 02:08:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> @julieannemery You were terrific! I'm really enjoying this season of @PreacherAMC, so far.
881965964065165314 2017-07-03 20:00:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AmalieHoward Any of the three @BacktotheFuture movies.
880268135697444864 2017-06-28 03:34:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Tracyphillips66 You were great on @SHO_TwinPeaks! A short-lived, but memorable, role! @sonofbum should be proud (as I'm sure he is).
878031380487127040 2017-06-22 23:26:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> You're welcome!
873385410172473344 2017-06-09 03:44:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> Ditto. When it comes to annoying sounds, the leaf blower is the biggest challenger to @JimCarrey's "most annoying sound in the world."
871532045033275393 2017-06-04 01:00:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tune in to @AMC_TV for the season three premiere of @FearTWD.
869655329688211457 2017-05-30 20:42:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Darshelle_ @OJessicaNigri Wowza!
868727399470555136 2017-05-28 07:15:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> @LauraKeeney I see you snagged "Revenge Of The Ninja." Nice! That's my favorite movie in "The Ninja Trilogy."
868345082486902785 2017-05-26 05:56:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @iamalmostasian @kathrynmalia Brilliant, as always!
866769319912460290 2017-05-22 21:34:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> @cscomiccon Awesome! I loved @abarbeau in "Carnivle," which I feel is the best @HBO series ever made.
866450862310293504 2017-05-21 00:29:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tonight, @SHO_TwinPeaks makes its long-awaited return. #TheOwlsAreNotWhatTheySeem
864317155654991872 2017-05-15 03:10:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> At last, the official birth of Saul Goodman on @BetterCallSaul.
863540526632636417 2017-05-13 23:44:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nbc @kathrynmalia @iamalmostasian You're now our only hope with your pilot! Hopefully, you'll find a network more open-minded than @NBC.
863540271518273538 2017-05-13 23:43:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nbc @kathrynmalia @iamalmostasian So, @NBC rejected the first potential #mixedrace #hapa comedic series, @kourtneykang's "Where I'm From."
863531376934617088 2017-05-13 23:08:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nbc @kourtneykang @IsabellaKRusso I'm half white/half Korean, and I was really hoping that show got picked up. If @NBC doesn't reconsider, could another network acquire it?
861437675571728384 2017-05-07 04:28:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @alicethebee Calbee is a Japanese company with business ties to China. I've tried a variation of the first snack. I liked it!
861054217305370624 2017-05-06 03:04:57 UTC <LukeSoroko> @KattShea1 I just watched "Psycho III," and I thought you were great! It surpasses "Psycho II." I can't believe you had to lay in real ice!
859611398367846400 2017-05-02 03:31:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> Holy shit, @CW_TheFlash.
859593586987474948 2017-05-02 02:20:56 UTC <LukeSoroko> @schuylerfisk I think I just spotted you in a new @marshalls commercial. That, or you have a doppelganger.
858044901094805507 2017-04-28 19:47:00 UTC <LukeSoroko> @msaliahn You were terrific on @cw_spn! I wish we could've seen more of you, but you certainly left your mark, especially with destroying the Colt!
856689312016060416 2017-04-24 02:00:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> Time for the last check-in to "Bates Motel."
856580084697837571 2017-04-24 18:46:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TJEldredge09 No, 2002 was correct. The @Rockies didn't sweep, nor win a series, over the @SFGiants in 2012.
856275861967974405 2017-04-23 22:37:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies blanked the @SFGiants, 8-0, to cap off their first three-game home sweep of their NL West rival in 15 years.
855653068276412416 2017-04-21 05:22:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @katiemusic You were awesome!
855232182150873089 2017-04-20 01:30:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk Same here. In fact, I'd argue season six has the best collection of standalone episodes ("Triangle," "Drive," "Monday," "Arcadia," etc.).
855228106797436928 2017-04-20 01:14:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk pic.twitter.com/6LRaPkwyxJ
854468774908579840 2017-04-18 22:56:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> @theblackwhiskyu @thebritsheridan Tough to choose just one. I'd say my favorites are, "Don't Take That Away From Me," "Love Comes And Goes" and "Time Heals Everything."
853813901846347776 2017-04-16 03:34:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Paco_Cabezas @TheRealAlGough I see @MorganicInk has @thexfiles' "The Post-Modern Prometheus" as her @Twitter header. I'm already a fan.
852659353417113601 2017-04-13 23:06:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @alicethebee Mix tomato soup with ramen noodles. It may not seem appetizing, but trust me, it's the best food combination ever. EVER.
851615802461761536 2017-04-10 02:00:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> "It's showtime, folks!" Season three of @BetterCallSaul begins now on @AMC_TV.
851171537994616832 2017-04-09 20:34:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @theblackwhiskyu @thebritsheridan I just listened to the album in its entirety. Well done! By the way, @iTunes mistakenly listed the record's release date as April 1, 2016.
843634257394388992 2017-03-19 01:24:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm at the @GameOfThrones live concert experience at @Pepsi_Center, featuring @Djawadi_Ramin. #GameOfThronesLivepic.twitter.com/ICaQvAJcLI

838167004750176256 2017-03-04 23:19:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @kathrynmalia @CIFF Hey, @DenverFilm, please follow suit. @iamalmostasian is fantastic and a much-needed inclusion for diverse programming.
833873982793342979 2017-02-20 03:00:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> The final season of "Bates Motel" is, officially, underway.
831374010998980609 2017-02-13 05:26:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> A shorthanded @nuggets squad beat the @warriors, 132-110, and in the process, tied an @NBA record with 24 made three-pointers in a game.
819683961492348933 2017-01-12 23:14:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @nuggets smash the @Pacers, 140-112, in London. 140 points is the most ever scored in an @NBA game outside of North America.
817237598481580033 2017-01-05 05:13:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> @feliciaday Congratulations!
816841452307312640 2017-01-04 02:59:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Get ready for the season 12 premiere of @alwayssunny on @FXXNetwork!
815643305975443456 2017-01-01 19:38:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm ringing in the new year by heading to @SportsAuthField to watch the @Broncos take on the @RAIDERS, in each team's regular season finale.

812138476133122048 2016-12-22 03:31:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> @truTVjokers Woohoo!
811790780067102720 2016-12-21 04:29:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> @steveyeun Happy Birthday!
810642319221358592 2016-12-18 00:26:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> Three turnovers, numerous drops and atrocious offensive line play doom the @Broncos, in a 16-3 home loss to the @Patriots.
810641598652514304 2016-12-18 00:23:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> @JordaNorwood with a fumble. How fitting.
810638900670713856 2016-12-18 00:12:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> What an incredibly stupid penalty by @BossWard43.
810637257090760704 2016-12-18 00:05:57 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' offense in the second half has been offensive.
810634801065656321 2016-12-18 23:56:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> Third field goal of the day for Stephen Gostkowski.
810627567946518528 2016-12-18 23:27:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> Of course, @DemaryiusT drops a big pass.
810626856835842048 2016-12-18 23:24:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> Another field goal for Stephen Gostkowski.
810626302508146688 2016-12-18 23:22:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> A botched snap is recovered by Tom Brady. Every bounce in this game, so far, has gone the @Patriots' way.
810622359405232128 2016-12-18 23:06:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Patriots' offense also goes three-and-out, on their first possession of the second half.
810620357275160576 2016-12-18 22:58:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> The offense for the @Broncos goes three-and-out to start the second half.
810610639207092224 2016-12-18 22:20:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Patriots capitalize on the turnover, via a @LG_Blount touchdown run, on second-and-goal.
810603522777645056 2016-12-18 21:51:54 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thekidmcmanus ties the game with a 33-yard field goal.
810600566019727360 2016-12-18 21:40:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos have an ugly habit of passing short of the line to gain.
810599613275246592 2016-12-18 21:36:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> Stephen Gostkowski makes a 45-yard field goal to give the @Patriots an early lead.
810598291142492161 2016-12-18 21:31:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> Unreal. @JordaNorwood muffs the punt return, giving the ball back to the @Patriots.
810597792766947328 2016-12-18 21:29:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Patriots receive the opening kickoff, and the @Broncos' defense forces a three-and-out.

809863053638443008 2016-12-16 20:49:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> @NBAMemes The @nuggets.
809625964766494720 2016-12-15 05:07:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GillianA Haha!
808567249615331328 2016-12-12 07:00:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TIME You're missing "Super Mario RPG: Legend Of The Seven Stars."
808056356246843393 2016-12-11 21:10:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos lose an ugly affair to the @Titans, 13-10. Their record now stands at 8-5, with three games left in the regular season.
808055032860045312 2016-12-11 21:05:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> With less than one minute remaining in the game, @AJ_Derby fumbles the ball. @Daymo03 recovers it.
808050599375867904 2016-12-11 20:47:30 UTC <LukeSoroko> @b_fowler13 drops a potential touchdown pass.
808049888894341120 2016-12-11 20:44:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> Great catch by @DemaryiusT.
808046796459175937 2016-12-11 20:32:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> Finally, the @Broncos get on the scoreboard, as @TrevorSiemian locates @ESanders_10 in the end zone.
808044463125839872 2016-12-11 20:23:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> On fourth-and-goal, the @Broncos go for it, but fail to score a touchdown.
808042205696888832 2016-12-11 20:14:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos execute a fake punt for a first down, as @RileyTDixon92 finds @CodyLatimer14 for a 16-yard completion.
808031328759382017 2016-12-11 19:30:55 UTC <LukeSoroko> With over a minute remaining until halftime, @ryansuccop kicks a 41-yard field goal.
808028085492781056 2016-12-11 19:18:02 UTC <LukeSoroko> Thankfully, @ChrisHarrisJr is back in the game.
808026859002875904 2016-12-11 19:13:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> A cheap shot by @HDouglas83 results in an injury to @ChrisHarrisJr.
808024538650910721 2016-12-11 19:03:57 UTC <LukeSoroko> @VicLombardi That was reminiscent of a play the @Panthers drew up against the @Broncos in @superbowl50.
808018789065523200 2016-12-11 18:41:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> There isn't a team worse in short-yardage situations than the @Broncos.
808016195358248961 2016-12-11 18:30:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> Following the turnover, the @Titans add to their lead, via a @ryansuccop 53-yard field goal.
808015331470036993 2016-12-11 18:27:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> The bad start continues for the @Broncos, as @JForsett coughs up the ball.
808013528372232192 2016-12-11 18:20:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> Meanwhile, the @Broncos' defense gives up a touchdown to the @Titans on their first offensive possession.
808010825235656704 2016-12-11 18:09:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> Awful play calling to start the game for the @Broncos. They had two downs to pick up one yard, and fail to do so, as they THROW both times.
807813718381838336 2016-12-10 05:06:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Avalanche Embarrassing.

806666908103753729 2016-12-07 01:09:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tonight, @impastortv and @SouthPark conclude their seasons.
805990565720576000 2016-12-05 04:21:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nuggets Shibby.
805520219384979457 2016-12-04 21:12:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> In @PaxtonLynch's second @NFL start, he passed for only 104 yards, but the @Broncos still took down the @Jaguars, 20-10.
805519212458418180 2016-12-04 21:08:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Second field goal of the day for @thekidmcmanus.
805518311878434818 2016-12-04 21:05:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> Fumble! @BBortles5 coughs up the ball, and @StingRay56 recovers it!
805511788448124928 2016-12-04 20:39:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> This time, the @Broncos' defense stops the @Jaguars' offense on fourth down.
805508009904504833 2016-12-04 20:24:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> Wow, @Broncos. How do you allow @BBortles5 to scamper for a 22-yard touchdown on fourth down?
805500311410450432 2016-12-04 19:53:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> Pick-six, compliments of @BradRoby_1!
805498791197638656 2016-12-04 19:47:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> Much like the beginning of the game, the offenses for the @Jaguars and the @Broncos open the second half by going three-and-out.
805493040211226624 2016-12-04 19:24:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Just before halftime, @thekidmcmanus kicks a 32-yard field goal.
805488389587947520 2016-12-04 19:06:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ChrisHarrisJr picks off @BBortles5!
805486258998939649 2016-12-04 18:57:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> A strong effort by @dbook23, on second-and-goal, results in a rushing touchdown.
805483155067203584 2016-12-04 18:45:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Jaguars get on the scoreboard first, via a @JayMy_31 47-yard field goal.
805480456082825216 2016-12-04 18:34:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Scoreless opening quarter.
805474850483695616 2016-12-04 18:12:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> The offenses for the @Broncos and the @Jaguars go three-and-out to start the game.
805473011457462272 2016-12-04 18:05:05 UTC <LukeSoroko> A lot of @Broncos fans at @EverBankField.
805207410415665152 2016-12-03 00:29:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @darcydonavan No problem!

804565608473890816 2016-12-01 05:59:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> @davidduchovny @XFilesNews Haha, that's great!
803841103174762497 2016-11-29 06:00:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tune in to @ComedyCentral for the season eight finale of "Tosh.0."
803109535002963968 2016-11-27 05:33:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> Ultimately, poor special teams play, along with the defense's inability to stop the @Chiefs late, cost the @Broncos the game.
803109349010849792 2016-11-27 05:32:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> Are you kidding me?!? A 34-yard @cairosantos19 field goal attempt bounces off the upright, and in, to give the @Chiefs a 30-27 victory.
803105911296454656 2016-11-27 05:19:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> Two-minute warning. The @Broncos are driving.
803104423744520192 2016-11-27 05:13:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Once again, the game is tied, as @cairosantos19 converts a 37-yard field goal.
803101225998831616 2016-11-27 05:00:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the ball first in overtime, and get a 44-yard field goal from @thekidmcmanus.
803098267940634624 2016-11-27 04:48:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> The game is going to overtime.
803096990561292288 2016-11-27 04:43:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> With 12 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, the @Chiefs score a touchdown and convert a game-tying two-point conversion.
803093446852575232 2016-11-27 04:29:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> 76-yard touchdown pass from @TrevorSiemian to @b_fowler13!
803088563902541824 2016-11-27 04:10:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> Second touchdown pass for @TrevorSiemian, this time to @ESanders_10.
803085652703133697 2016-11-27 03:58:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> This has been a night to forget for the @Broncos' special teams, as @JordaNorwood muffs a punt return, giving the ball to the @Chiefs.
803082796994625536 2016-11-27 03:47:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> A terrible special teams penalty, during a field goal attempt, allows the @Chiefs to score a drive-extending touchdown.
803078475875631105 2016-11-27 03:30:03 UTC <LukeSoroko> On third-and-goal, @TrevorSiemian finds Jordan Taylor in the end zone.
803074745986150400 2016-11-27 03:15:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' defense forces the @Chiefs' offense to go three-and-out to begin the second half.
803068624424632321 2016-11-27 02:50:55 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 First sack for @Millerlite40.
803068035216994304 2016-11-27 02:48:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> With under two minutes remaining until halftime, @thekidmcmanus makes a 33-yard field goal.
803066243360104448 2016-11-27 02:41:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ESanders_10 is one of the toughest players in the @NFL.
803064968216215552 2016-11-27 02:36:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> And now, the @Chiefs return the free kick for a touchdown. Ugh.
803063984962215936 2016-11-27 02:32:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Chiefs get on the scoreboard first, via a safety.
803060279676375040 2016-11-27 02:17:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> Good to see @KapriBibbs back in the game.
803056849700421632 2016-11-27 02:04:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' offense has struggled in converting third-and-short situations this year.
803056213466423296 2016-11-27 02:01:36 UTC <LukeSoroko> Damn, I felt that @Stuntman1429 hit on @KapriBibbs from my living room. Hopefully, he's OK.
803052888272543745 2016-11-27 01:48:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> @VicLombardi He also goes overboard with his flopping.
803051955920707584 2016-11-27 01:44:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Awful punt by @RileyTDixon92.
803050569237544960 2016-11-27 01:39:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> The offense for the @Chiefs also goes three-and-out on their first possession.
803049589561495552 2016-11-27 01:35:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the opening kickoff, and surprise, surprise, the offense goes three-and-out.
802730229030678529 2016-11-26 04:26:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @cubuffs @RunRalphieRun Woohoo!

801285732509708288 2016-11-22 04:46:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> Despite @JimmyButler doing his best @manuginobili impression in late-game flopping, the @nuggets beat the @chicagobulls, 110-107.

798050635329335297 2016-11-13 06:31:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Jaboowins @NFL Shades of Randall Cunningham.
797911240668377089 2016-11-13 21:17:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos edge the @Saints, 25-23, on a wild finish. They'll head into the bye week at 7-3.
797910289094053888 2016-11-13 21:13:32 UTC <LukeSoroko> @PhillyWill11 returns the ball for two points.
797909957152641025 2016-11-13 21:12:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> Unreal. @brandincooks catches a 32-yard touchdown pass from @drewbrees to tie the game, but @jsimms1119 blocks the extra point.

797892111139999744 2016-11-13 20:01:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> On the @Saints' opening offensive possession of the second half, they go on a 90-yard, game-tying touchdown drive.
797887294736920576 2016-11-13 19:42:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> Just as the clock expires for halftime, the @Saints notch a field goal. @TrevorSiemian's INT turns out to be, at least, a six-point swing.

795521261107609600 2016-11-06 07:00:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DenverChannel @TroyRenck Damn.
795488233299869702 2016-11-06 04:49:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos lose an ugly affair to the @RAIDERS, 30-20. The defense allowed over 200 yards rushing. Unacceptable.
795487347299205120 2016-11-06 04:45:37 UTC <LukeSoroko> Reggie Nelson intercepts @TrevorSiemian.
795483944921792512 2016-11-06 04:32:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos answer with a 69-yard catch-and-run touchdown from @KapriBibbs.
795482509974900737 2016-11-06 04:26:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> Third rushing touchdown for @LataviusM, aided by penalties.
795481239167913984 2016-11-06 04:21:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> What an awful call.
795479809610629125 2016-11-06 04:15:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> The first turnover of the game comes on a strip-sack of @TrevorSiemian.
795478538182860800 2016-11-06 04:10:37 UTC <LukeSoroko> Sebastian Janikowski converts a 35-yard field goal attempt.
795478157033881600 2016-11-06 04:09:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> A bobbled catch by @KingCrab15 nearly gives the @RAIDERS a first down. The bounces have gone their way tonight.
795475194697621504 2016-11-06 03:57:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> The fourth quarter starts with a 44-yard @thekidmcmanus field goal.
795470383080214528 2016-11-06 03:38:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> The end result of the @Broncos' opening possession of the second half is much like the one to begin the game -- three-and-out.
795462247346831360 2016-11-06 03:05:53 UTC <LukeSoroko> Just as the clock expires for halftime, @thekidmcmanus makes a 55-yard field goal.
795459291444629506 2016-11-06 02:54:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> Rushing defense has been problematic for the @Broncos all season long.
795456273483497472 2016-11-06 02:42:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> Sebastian Janikowski misses a field goal attempt of 48 yards.
795453982646870016 2016-11-06 02:33:02 UTC <LukeSoroko> A 36-yard touchdown pass from @TrevorSiemian to @JordaNorwood puts the @Broncos on the scoreboard.
795453054732615680 2016-11-06 02:29:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> FINALLY, the @Broncos get a first down, via a tremendous @DemaryiusT third-down catch.
795450032904425473 2016-11-06 02:17:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> On third-and-goal, @LataviusM scores a rushing touchdown.
795444807753728000 2016-11-06 01:56:35 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 First sack for @Millerlite40.
795442693635801088 2016-11-06 01:48:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> A drop from @VGreen85, on third down, leads to back-to-back three-and-outs for the offense of the @Broncos.
795441500444303361 2016-11-06 01:43:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> Opposing teams continue to score on their first possessions against the @Broncos' defense, as the @RAIDERS get a field goal.
795439409332178944 2016-11-06 01:35:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the opening kickoff, and go three-and-out, following incomplete passes by @TrevorSiemian on each play.

794408471600852992 2016-11-03 05:18:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> @alannarizzo Ugly game, but at least, @RunRalphieRun won.
794039980997820419 2016-11-02 04:54:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> For the first time in 108 years, the @Cubs have won the World Series.
793669152867094528 2016-11-01 04:20:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ChelseaClinton I attended your rally here in Aurora, Colorado. You were great!
792873569466265600 2016-10-30 23:39:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos defeat the @Chargers, 27-19. Another divisional test awaits them, next Sunday night, against the @RAIDERS.
792872097802399744 2016-10-30 23:33:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> Turnover on downs!
792870430260408320 2016-10-30 23:26:56 UTC <LukeSoroko> That was @RileyTDixon92's best punt of the season, so far, especially given the circumstances.
792869235143774210 2016-10-30 23:22:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> Huge goal-line stand by the @Broncos' defense.
792868025137455104 2016-10-30 23:17:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> For the first time in 22 games, the @Broncos' defense has allowed a 100-yard rusher (@Melvingordon25).
792866963160576000 2016-10-30 23:13:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> Unfortunately, the @Broncos have to settle for a field goal.
792865761173700609 2016-10-30 23:08:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tremendous catch by @DemaryiusT. The @Broncos have the ball on the @Chargers' four-yard-line.
792864051122491392 2016-10-30 23:01:35 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TrevorSiemian's pass goes off of @JordaNorwood's hands, leading to a pick-six. The @Chargers' two-point try is unsuccessful.
792862687596191744 2016-10-30 22:56:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> First career sack for @jsimms1119.
792860104081022976 2016-10-30 22:45:54 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos answer with a touchdown drive of their own, spanning 75 yards.
792857278051258368 2016-10-30 22:34:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Following @dbook23's fumble, the @Chargers go on a 98-yard touchdown drive. @MOOCHIE048 blocks the extra point.
792852628912734209 2016-10-30 22:16:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> This time, however, the @Broncos are unable to capitalize on the turnover, as @dbook23 fumbles the ball on a catch-and-run.
792851907542867968 2016-10-30 22:13:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> And now, @BossWard43 picks off Philip Rivers!
792851236475117568 2016-10-30 22:10:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos capitalize on the turnover, via a three-yard @dbook23 touchdown run. They lead the @NFL in points off turnovers.
792850366798848004 2016-10-30 22:07:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> @darianstewart26 intercepts Philip Rivers!
792844809538969600 2016-10-30 21:45:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> @JoshuaLambo2 misses a 45-yard field goal attempt.
792843051982913536 2016-10-30 21:38:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MelvinIngram strip-sacks @TrevorSiemian. @palepoi95 recovers the ball.
792842052278980608 2016-10-30 21:34:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Nice diving catch by @ESanders_10.
792837558761771008 2016-10-30 21:16:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> Pick-six, compliments of @BradRoby_1!
792834779204857856 2016-10-30 21:05:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 First sack of the game for @Millerlite40.
792825189474062336 2016-10-30 20:27:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> Just like in their initial meeting this season, the @Broncos' defense allows the @Chargers to score a touchdown on their first drive.
792821987802349568 2016-10-30 20:14:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the opening kickoff, and march down the field, but they settle for a 28-yard @thekidmcmanus field goal.
792587615224500224 2016-10-29 04:43:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> Unbelievable choke job by the @nuggets.
792508127220371457 2016-10-29 23:27:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm heading to @Pepsi_Center for the @nuggets' regular season home opener. @officialmutombo will have his #55 jersey retired.

791399594437386240 2016-10-26 22:02:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tonight, the @nuggets tip off their regular season, on the road, versus the @PelicansNBA.
791145212412325893 2016-10-25 05:11:32 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XFilesNews Excellent TV series.
790759411098660865 2016-10-24 03:38:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> In @bosweiler17's return to Denver, he was held to 131 passing yards and zero touchdowns, as the @Broncos beat the @HoustonTexans, 27-9.
790757452182540289 2016-10-24 03:30:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> Second field goal of the game for @thekidmcmanus.
790756204884598784 2016-10-24 03:25:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @HoustonTexans go for it on fourth-and-10 from their own 34-yard-line, and @Derek_Wolfe95 bats down @bosweiler17's pass.
790753815028871169 2016-10-24 03:16:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> Drops continue to be an issue for @DemaryiusT.
790750388936814592 2016-10-24 03:02:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> Following the @HoustonTexans' second turnover, the @Broncos notch a field goal.
790749033836847104 2016-10-24 02:57:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @bosweiler17 fumbles the ball, as it slips out of his hand. @ChrisHarrisJr recovers for the @Broncos.
790747168000749568 2016-10-24 02:49:50 UTC <LukeSoroko> It's also the first touchdown the @Broncos have scored in the third quarter this season.
790746919429545984 2016-10-24 02:48:51 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos capitalize on the turnover, as @dbook23 gets the first rushing touchdown of his @NFL career.
790745859159797760 2016-10-24 02:44:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> @darianstewart26 forces a fumble of Alfred Blue; @BamBamDavis53 recovers the ball.
790742628346175489 2016-10-24 02:31:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> Not a good punt by @RileyTDixon92.
790741076692774912 2016-10-24 02:25:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> On the @HoustonTexans' first offensive drive of the second half, they add another field goal.
790737739968753668 2016-10-24 02:12:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' offense opens the second half by going three-and-out.
790734174739050496 2016-10-24 01:58:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Gary Kubiak's approach in closing out the first half was way too conservative.
790730511089938432 2016-10-24 01:43:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> On third-and-goal, @TrevorSiemian throws a dart to @DemaryiusT in the end zone.
790726480124796928 2016-10-24 01:27:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos get on the scoreboard, via a @cjandersonb22 seven-yard touchdown run.

790719845469786112 2016-10-24 01:01:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> @9nicknovak makes a 43-yard field goal.
790714155346997248 2016-10-24 00:38:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> The offense for the @Broncos also goes three-and-out on their first drive.
790713059291521024 2016-10-24 00:34:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' defense forces the @HoustonTexans to go three-and-out on their opening offensive possession.
790459181039951872 2016-10-24 07:45:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> @steveyeun You'll be missed on @WalkingDead_AMC. Glenn was my favorite character. We need more Asian representation on television.
790357304675700736 2016-10-23 01:00:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Time to check out the season seven premiere of @WalkingDead_AMC.

788231483911569408 2016-10-17 04:13:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Avalanche Hoody hoo!
787509704561831937 2016-10-15 04:25:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Avalanche opened their regular season with a 6-5 victory over the @DallasStars. @Joe_Colborne notched his first career hat trick.

786775875199000576 2016-10-13 03:49:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' @NFL-record 15-game road winning streak, within the division, is snapped, as they lose an ugly affair to the @Chargers, 21-13.
786775605597483009 2016-10-13 03:48:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> A Hail Mary throw by @TrevorSiemian falls short of the end zone.
786772836236963840 2016-10-13 03:37:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos recover an onside kick attempt.
786772051377790976 2016-10-13 03:34:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> With 27 seconds left, @thekidmcmanus kicks a 46-yard field goal.
786769335423344641 2016-10-13 03:23:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos march into @Chargers territory, but @DemaryiusT fumbles the ball.
786765017978777600 2016-10-13 03:06:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> Finally, the @Broncos reach the end zone, with 8:08 remaining in the game.
786762785757601795 2016-10-13 02:57:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> The free kick is muffed by the @Chargers, giving the ball back to the @Broncos.
786762268440612864 2016-10-13 02:55:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos are flagged for offensive holding in the end zone, resulting in a safety.
786759609591541760 2016-10-13 02:44:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thekidmcmanus misses a 56-yard field goal attempt.
786753242541666304 2016-10-13 02:19:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Korey_Toomer forces a fumble of Jordan Taylor.
786751433580306434 2016-10-13 02:12:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Then, the @Broncos' defense immediately allows @Melvingordon25 to run for 48 yards.
786749203078787073 2016-10-13 02:03:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' offense goes three-and-out to start the second half.
786745519582437376 2016-10-13 01:48:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> Needless to say, that was a rather disconcerting first half for the @Broncos.
786740241298104323 2016-10-13 01:27:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> Unfortunately, the @Broncos are only able to manage a field goal after the turnover.
786739370573299713 2016-10-13 01:24:17 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Chargers botch a punt return, giving the @Broncos possession at San Diego's 11-yard-line.
786734555822686209 2016-10-13 01:05:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MikeKlis They did that in the loss to the @AtlantaFalcons.
786733815439892480 2016-10-13 01:02:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Third-down defense continues to be an issue for the @Broncos.
786729164942352384 2016-10-13 00:43:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> In back-to-back games, the @Broncos' defense has allowed opening drive touchdowns to the opposition.
786722370186805248 2016-10-13 00:16:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> Qualcomm Stadium is packed with @Broncos fans.
786023147627618305 2016-10-11 01:58:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> Get ready for the season three premiere of @FreshOffABC!
785923871333416960 2016-10-11 19:23:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> @SloanArcher Ditto.
785705071015174144 2016-10-10 04:54:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> @kathrynmalia @angryasianman Disgraceful.
785256890611617793 2016-10-09 23:13:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> In @PaxtonLynch's inaugural @NFL start, he went 23-of-35 for 223 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He was also sacked six times.
785255786792353792 2016-10-09 23:09:03 UTC <LukeSoroko> Game over. The @Broncos drop their first game of the season, 23-16, to the @AtlantaFalcons.

785216103647543296 2016-10-09 20:31:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> Not a good start for the @Broncos' defense, as they allow the @AtlantaFalcons to extend their lead, via a @Matt_Bryant3 46-yard field goal.

782742836550578176 2016-10-02 00:43:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos dominate the @TBBuccaneers, 27-7, but at a cost, with a left shoulder injury to @TrevorSiemian. Hopefully, it isn't serious.
782741095138533376 2016-10-02 00:36:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> Very sloppy conditions.
782737098889506816 2016-10-02 00:20:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> After a weather delay of over one hour, the @Broncos-@TBBuccaneers game has resumed.
782718225997963264 2016-10-02 23:05:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos-@TBBuccaneers game has been suspended, due to potentially hazardous weather.
782712935449698304 2016-10-02 22:44:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> First career @NFL touchdown pass for @PaxtonLynch, as he finds @ESanders_10 in the end zone.
782710883117957120 2016-10-02 22:36:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> A chant of, "Let's go, @Broncos!" has broken out at @RJStadium.
782703679329542144 2016-10-02 22:07:53 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos come out of halftime, and march down the field, but they end up settling for another @thekidmcmanus field goal.
782696580361039872 2016-10-02 21:39:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> Just before halftime, @thekidmcmanus converts a 38-yard field goal.
782693274146320384 2016-10-02 21:26:32 UTC <LukeSoroko> Fuuuuuuuck. @TrevorSiemian is hurt. Rookie @PaxtonLynch is now in the game.
782692551522291712 2016-10-02 21:23:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Fumble! @Billy_Boi_90 recovers!
782686261475549184 2016-10-02 20:58:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> Once again, the @Broncos capitalize on the turnover -- this time, on a short @cjandersonb22 touchdown run.
782684348302581760 2016-10-02 20:51:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> Another interception for Aqib Talib!

782674544087576576 2016-10-02 20:12:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos immediately capitalize on the turnover, as @TrevorSiemian connects with @DemaryiusT for a touchdown.
782673819290836992 2016-10-02 20:09:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> Interception by Aqib Talib!

780648577324285952 2016-09-26 06:01:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> @LCMayhew The best city in the world!
780136980692676608 2016-09-25 20:08:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos take down the @Bengals, on the road, 29-17. @TrevorSiemian throws for 312 yards, four touchdowns and zero interceptions.

780131587342020608 2016-09-25 19:47:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> For the first time today, the @Broncos' defense forces the @Bengals' offense to go three-and-out.
780129902850736128 2016-09-25 19:40:37 UTC <LukeSoroko> Third touchdown pass for @TrevorSiemian, this time to @jphillips8983. Unfortunately, the two-point try is unsuccessful.
780125674174500864 2016-09-25 19:23:49 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MikeNugent85 converts a 34-yard field goal for the @Bengals.
780120313145102337 2016-09-25 19:02:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> Back-to-back sacks by @StingRay56!
780119294189326336 2016-09-25 18:58:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> On the @Broncos' opening offensive possession of the second half, @REALPACMAN24 forces a fumble of @DemaryiusT.
780113593945554944 2016-09-25 18:35:49 UTC <LukeSoroko> Just before halftime, @TrevorSiemian tosses his second touchdown to @ESanders_10. @thekidmcmanus' extra point attempt is blocked.
780110695438233600 2016-09-25 18:24:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> Twice on this drive, @TrevorSiemian has come close to throwing an interception.
780107705360842752 2016-09-25 18:12:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Bengals retake the lead, following their second rushing touchdown of the day.
780103030490341377 2016-09-25 17:53:50 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos capitalize on the @Bengals' turnover, as @TrevorSiemian throws a 41-yard touchdown to @ESanders_10.
780102100734705664 2016-09-25 17:50:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Zaireanderson13 forces @REALPACMAN24 to fumble on a punt return, giving the @Broncos good field position.

780093186949525505 2016-09-25 17:14:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> Awful rushing defense by the @Broncos, on the @Bengals' first offensive drive, results in a touchdown on the ground.
780091661997137921 2016-09-25 17:08:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the opening kickoff and go three-and-out on offense.

778483002686877696 2016-09-20 06:36:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 @MileHighReport Done and/or done.
778035978199928832 2016-09-19 01:00:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> Season three of @Gotham starts now on @FOXTV.
777653111535972352 2016-09-18 23:38:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 Another sack by @Millerlite40 to finish the game! The @Broncos defeat the Colts, 34-20.
777651346941980672 2016-09-18 23:31:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 Strip sack by @Millerlite40! @StingRay56 recovers the ball and takes it to the end zone!
777650329361854464 2016-09-18 23:27:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> With under two minutes remaining, @thekidmcmanus makes a 35-yard field goal. The @Colts have no timeouts.
777647109860306945 2016-09-18 23:14:53 UTC <LukeSoroko> Frank Gore tiptoes his way to the end zone, on a seven-yard catch-and-run, and the @Colts cut the @Broncos' lead to 23-20.
777639956776751105 2016-09-18 22:46:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> Pick-six compliments of Aqib Talib!
777637244458774528 2016-09-18 22:35:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos recapture the lead, via a @thekidmcmanus 33-yard field goal.
777634451618541572 2016-09-18 22:24:35 UTC <LukeSoroko> For as good as the @Broncos' defense is, third downs have been an issue, even going back to last season.
777633439579201536 2016-09-18 22:20:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Colts tie the game on a five-yard touchdown run by @RobT_33.
777631379597107200 2016-09-18 22:12:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> Are you kidding me, @Broncos?!? How do you allow Andrew Luck to convert a third-and-20, with his legs?!?
777630620981702656 2016-09-18 22:09:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TroyRenck Damn. Hopefully, the injury isn't serious.
777627143068979200 2016-09-18 21:55:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> Despite out-gaining the @Colts, 294 yards to 72 yards, the @Broncos have scored just seven more points at the half.
777626173081722880 2016-09-18 21:51:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> Second field goal of the day for @thekidmcmanus.
777625413774217216 2016-09-18 21:48:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Nice catch-and-run by @cjandersonb22 for the first down.
777622579439808512 2016-09-18 21:37:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Colts capitalize on the turnover, as they add another field goal.
777621390375518208 2016-09-18 21:32:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TrevorSiemian is intercepted, with the @Broncos driving. That was a bad play call.
777617917189906432 2016-09-18 21:18:53 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 First sack of the game for @Millerlite40, and first sack of his career vs. Andrew Luck.
777616567173386240 2016-09-18 21:13:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> Touchdown, @Broncos! @cjandersonb22 runs it in from four yards out.
777613306651566080 2016-09-18 21:00:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DemaryiusT has to catch that ball.
777612332268527616 2016-09-18 20:56:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> Back-to-back weeks in which the opposing team's punter drills a punt of over 70 yards.
777610566630125568 2016-09-18 20:49:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> This time, @thekidmcmanus converts, albeit, from a much shorter distance (23 yards).
777608425551175680 2016-09-18 20:41:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Following @thekidmcmanus' missed field goal, the @Colts take advantage of good field position by connecting on a field goal of their own.
777606790892486656 2016-09-18 20:34:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the opening kickoff, but they fail to score, as @thekidmcmanus misses a 54-yard field goal.
777377787183104004 2016-09-17 05:24:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies blanked the @Padres, 8-0, at Coors Field. @MrGrayWolf22 pitched brilliantly (CG, 4 H, 0 R, 0 BB, franchise-record 16 K).

728467761307865088 2016-05-05 06:13:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies smash the @SFGiants, 17-7, behind a 13-run fifth inning. That's right, 13 runs in one inning, which is a franchise record.
728098204370145280 2016-05-04 05:45:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Well done, @cw_spn.
727737353184358401 2016-05-03 05:51:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AngeliqueKerber @WTA Voted.
727386907747831808 2016-05-02 06:38:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> My favorite @007 film, "GoldenEye," is on @AMC_TV. Its Nintendo 64 companion is, arguably, the best video game adaptation ever made.
726988895850635264 2016-05-01 04:17:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Rockies Nolan Arenado is, without question, @MLB's best third baseman.
726258815939670017 2016-04-29 03:56:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> Thank you, @NASA and @NASASocial, for providing me the tremendous experience of covering @OSIRISREx!

724396527708327936 2016-04-24 00:36:05 UTC <LukeSoroko> Wow, what a meltdown by the @Rockies. Hopefully, the season premieres of @GameOfThrones and @SiliconHBO will wash away this bad taste.

720498390606422017 2016-04-13 06:26:17 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @nuggets are the only team to defeat the 72-10 @chicagobulls and the 73-9 @warriors.
719329142278197248 2016-04-10 01:00:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> Season two of @FearTWD begins now on @AMC_TV!
719018487084023808 2016-04-09 04:25:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Once again, the @Rockies lose at home to the @Padres, this time by a score of 16-3. @Tstory2's home run streak comes to an end.
718679916733005824 2016-04-08 06:00:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nuggets Well done.
718602860603117569 2016-04-08 00:54:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies drop their home opener, 13-6, to the @Padres. @Tstory2 continues his historic start to the season, with two more home runs.
718314011507482624 2016-04-07 05:46:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @dorkly Nintendo 64.
717999675731681284 2016-04-07 08:57:17 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ComedyCentral I liked the nod to "Mrs. Doubtfire."
717905407511912449 2016-04-06 02:42:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies open 2016 with a series win over the @Dbacks. @Tstory2 is the first player in @MLB history to homer in his first three games.
717795631230636032 2016-04-06 19:26:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles The final issue of @IDWPublishing's "@TheXFiles: Season 11" is out today! Pick it up!
717571872125116416 2016-04-05 04:37:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Rockies That was painful to watch.
717164983998488576 2016-04-04 01:40:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> The 2016 @Rockies regular season is, officially, underway.

707788406332334080 2016-03-09 04:41:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles @DenverComicCon I picked up both covers of @IDWPublishing's one-shot comic "@TheXFiles: Deviations," by @AmyChu, @LaraWest and @CaliSilvia.
706754436689825792 2016-03-07 08:12:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @CodyTruesdale69 Haha, why those locations?
706557115314208768 2016-03-06 19:08:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> Here's to you, Manning. "Omaha!"
706557050961022976 2016-03-06 19:08:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm also happy that I was in attendance for Manning's final home game, which was this year's AFC Championship Game, at @SportsAuthField.
706556820077195264 2016-03-06 19:07:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm glad that Manning was able to ride off into the sunset, with a second @SuperBowl ring.
706556613570596864 2016-03-06 19:06:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> The legendary Peyton Manning has called it a career. In my opinion, he's the second-best quarterback in @NFL history, behind @johnelway.

698059796470083584 2016-02-12 08:23:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Broncos @NFL I certainly did!
697300563818475520 2016-02-09 06:06:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> Wow, the latest episode of @CW_TheFlash could've operated as a season finale. So much craziness.
697112312197435392 2016-02-09 17:38:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm off to the @Broncos @SuperBowl parade!
696535148221718528 2016-02-07 03:24:54 UTC <LukeSoroko> That's all, folks! For the third time in franchise history, the @Broncos are @SuperBowl champions! Hoody hoo!
696531758343262208 2016-02-07 03:11:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> Second sack of the @SuperBowl for @DeMarcusWare!
696531199385165824 2016-02-07 03:09:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> The two-point conversion is good!
696530472805933056 2016-02-07 03:06:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> Touchdown, @Broncos! @cjandersonb22 runs it in from two yards out!
696529407112916992 2016-02-07 03:02:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 FUCK YEAH! @Millerlite40 IS THE MAN!
696528671406845952 2016-02-07 02:59:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Ultra conservative play call by the @Broncos.
696527171439894528 2016-02-07 02:53:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DemaryiusT slips to the ground, as the @Broncos are now one-of-12 on third downs.
696525641789759488 2016-02-07 02:47:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GrahamGano converts a 39-yard field goal attempt for the @Panthers, following the @Broncos' turnover.
696523421044199424 2016-02-07 02:38:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> Two Peyton Manning fumbles on that possession for the @Broncos. Unfortunately, the @Panthers recovered the second one.
696519011396235265 2016-02-07 02:20:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> Surprise, surprise, @SchoBlue75 allows a sack.
696518135126446080 2016-02-07 02:17:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> @BossWard43 picks off @CameronNewton, then fumbles the ball, but thankfully, the @Broncos recover.
696517473550471168 2016-02-07 02:14:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> How the hell does that happen?!?
696515891710676992 2016-02-07 02:08:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos have reached the red zone three times, so far, and they've had to settle for three field goals.
696514064332115968 2016-02-07 02:01:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GrahamGano misses a 44-yard field goal on the @Panthers' opening second half possession.
696503642438791168 2016-02-07 01:19:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DeMarcusWare sacks @CameronNewton to close out the first half.
696499838909714432 2016-02-07 01:04:36 UTC <LukeSoroko> Fuck. Peyton Manning throws an interception in @Panthers territory.
696499269348433921 2016-02-07 01:02:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> Great run by @cjandersonb22!
696498948446367744 2016-02-07 01:01:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> I've said it before, and I'll say it again, this wouldn't be a @Broncos game without a @DemaryiusT drop.
696498726232154114 2016-02-07 01:00:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> Yes! @darianstewart26 forces a fumble, and @Grindin_59 recovers the ball!
696496877542354945 2016-02-07 00:52:50 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thekidmcmanus notches his second field goal of the day, this time from a yard closer than his first one.
696495936080510977 2016-02-07 00:49:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> @JordaNorwood with a tremendous punt return!
696492179871526912 2016-02-07 00:34:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> A one-yard @Jonathanstewar1 touchdown run gets the @Panthers on the scoreboard.
696491433599979520 2016-02-07 00:31:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> Another Talib penalty....
696487399996567552 2016-02-07 00:15:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Incredibly stupid penalty from Aqib Talib.
696485710786736129 2016-02-07 00:08:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 Strip sack by @Millerlite40! @TheMalikJackson recovers the ball in the end zone for a @Broncos defensive touchdown!
696482696248168448 2016-02-07 23:56:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> Three-and-out for the @Panthers on their opening offensive drive.
696481977411604480 2016-02-07 23:53:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos score the first points of the @SuperBowl, via a @thekidmcmanus 34-yard field goal.
696480761369595904 2016-02-07 23:48:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> Peyton Manning completes an 18-yard pass to @owendaniels, on the @Broncos' first offensive snap of the game.
696476086608134145 2016-02-07 23:30:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Go, @Broncos!

692945899899785216 2016-01-28 05:42:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ScottieBeam The title track to @Coolio's "Gangsta's Paradise." In fact, that was the first album I ever purchased.
692622873702199296 2016-01-28 08:18:56 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Avalanche Nice comeback victory!

691439407904067584 2016-01-24 01:56:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @RealNickiAycox You know it! I just got back home after going crazy at the @Broncos game. I'm sore, but it was worth it! On to @thexfiles!
691438962640945152 2016-01-24 01:54:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> For the second time in three years, the @Broncos are @SuperBowl bound!
691316341383389184 2016-01-24 17:47:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> And just like in 2014, I hope the @Broncos come out victorious again!

969081204812087297 2018-02-28 05:25:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles Also, this episode certainly puts a new spin on the drone promotion, organized by @gofooji and @swagbyfox, for the season premiere in January.
969080958216421376 2018-02-28 05:24:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles Brilliant episode. Top-notch writing from @kristenclokem and Shannon Hamblin, as well as Emmy-worthy directing by Glen Morgan. This season has, at least, two episodes that deserve nominations: "Plus One" for @KarinKonoval's guest role and this one for Morgan's directing.
969060047857664001 2018-02-28 04:01:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ComedyCentralPR @usatodaylife I said that after I watched the first four episodes, which were available on demand before @corporate officially premiered on @ComedyCentral.

Maybe it can be sold for nearly $15,000, ala what happened after @McDonalds' "Mulan" Szechuan sauce was mentioned on @RickandMorty. #AloneTogether

962159229372006401 2018-02-09 03:00:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> @OverboardMovie This was probably your most poorly-executed promotion since your inception. Many people (like yours truly) tweeted multiple times, for several hours, and never received a response. @gofoojihelp took hours to reply to DMs, too. You need to take a serious look at your process.

How is it that other people, who have tweeted a couple of minutes ago, have already received links? You're not being transparent about this process.
962072308079710208 2018-02-09 21:14:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> @OverboardMovie @momofthree2017 Me, too. There was no mention of this promotion being restricted to a certain area; so, I don't know what's going on. I've DM'd @gofoojihelp, but all they said is that they're working on it.
962069381311115266 2018-02-09 21:03:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> @gofooji @OverboardMovie Hopefully, this actually works now. A number of us have tweeted #OverboardMovie +  for the past hour, but didn't receive a response.

957059768920825856 2018-01-26 01:16:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk "The Lost Art Of Forehead Sweat" was another brilliant offering. It sent Trump supporters into a frenzy, which is always a good thing.  Also, the last scene with the alien looked like it was filmed on the same location as "Mulholland Dr.," which is fitting, given both narratives.
957059556802269185 2018-01-26 01:15:54 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk Same. Although, he said he was never really fond of "War Of The Coprophages." Personally, that's one of my favorite episodes of #TheXFiles. He was even a little bit critical of "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose," which is almost universally acclaimed.
956409150803664901 2018-01-24 06:11:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DAVID_LYNCH @thexfiles @dblmdl I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that!
956395901479612416 2018-01-24 05:18:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles It was soooooo #PoCo.
956394569137930240 2018-01-24 05:13:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles Can anybody confirm if that scene with the alien handing over "All The Answers" was shot on the same location as @DAVID_LYNCH's "Mulholland Dr."? If so, I can't help but think that was done on purpose, given the narrative of this episode and the movie as well.
956392185888260096 2018-01-24 05:04:00 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XFilesNews It was soooooo #PoCo. #XFForeheadSweat
956386821834813440 2018-01-24 04:42:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DAVID_LYNCH @KyinHI @XFilesNews @AviQuijada Please do. I'd be surprised if that was a coincidence and not a conscience decision. Then again, last week, I had similar feelings regarding @KarinKonoval's character of Chucky. Maybe I'm just reading too much between the lines.
956367950528696320 2018-01-24 03:27:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> @east_coastbias Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the last bit with the alien filmed on the same location as @DAVID_LYNCH's "Mulholland Dr."? If so, that was a genius move, given the narrative of the episode and the movie itself. If you, or anybody, is ever able to interview Darin, please ask.
956363019616796672 2018-01-24 03:08:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> @KyinHI @AviQuijada @XFilesNews Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't that last bit with the alien filmed on the same location as @DAVID_LYNCH's "Mulholland Dr."?

956058962482343938 2018-01-23 06:59:54 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ComedyWorks @sarahtiana Fun fact: Knowshon Moreno blocked me on Twitter. He may have done so by mistake, though, as I've always been complimentary of him. Maybe he doesn't like compliments.  Anyway, if I'm not feeling too lazy later this week, I'll try to catch one of your shows.
956025334549315590 2018-01-23 04:46:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> @CelesteCkStudio Welcome back to Colorado!
956002455203889152 2018-01-23 03:15:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TheAcademy @MoooooooonRiver There have been plenty of instances in which less-than-stellar movies have received acting nominations. Also, Chau only has a bright future if she's given the right opportunities. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't have a good track record in its treatment of Asians.
955968611142676480 2018-01-23 01:00:52 UTC <LukeSoroko> Here's your annual reminder that more white women have won Oscars for racist "yellowface" portrayals of Asian characters than Asian actresses. No Asian actress has been nominated since 1994. That should've ended with Hong Chau, but she was ignored.  Fuck @TheAcademy. #Oscars2018
955967243950551045 2018-01-23 00:55:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk I can't say I'm as thrilled. Hong Chau should've been nominated. No Asian actress has been nominated since 1994. In fact, more white women have won Academy Awards for racist "yellowface" portrayals of Asian characters than actual Asian actresses. @TheAcademy is a disgrace.
955166804258664448 2018-01-21 19:54:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @fandom_ly In my opinion, it's the best episode of the past two seasons, so far. #TheXFiles
954181315326181376 2018-01-18 02:38:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AviQuijada @XFilesNews Thanks for asking @KarinKonoval my question! I got a Gaff and Al Swearengen vibe from Chucky, especially the look. However, I guess that was just a coincidence, and not an influence, as Karin stated. Regardless, she was fantastic and delivered an Emmy-worthy performance!
954122602494087168 2018-01-18 22:45:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> @kimrhodes4real @TheJimMichaels @darcydonavan I'll definitely be watching! I'm a big fan of @cw_spn, too!
954116615259414528 2018-01-18 22:21:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> @LaAlison_Araya_ That was, unquestionably, the best episode of the past two seasons of @thexfiles. You were great!
953860696348835840 2018-01-17 05:24:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XFilesNews Firstly, @KarinKonoval, that was an Emmy-worthy performance. Secondly, Chucky felt like a cross between Gaff on the original @bladerunner and Al Swearengen on "Deadwood," topped off with a Michael J. Anderson-esque voice. Were any of them influences for your character? #AskKarin
953859639623368705 2018-01-17 05:20:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @GillianA I said this elsewhere, but it bears repeating: Tonight's episode was, without a doubt, the best one of the past two seasons. @KarinKonoval should win an Emmy. She gave one of the all-time great guest-starring performances in the entire run of @thexfiles.
953855517021036551 2018-01-17 05:04:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles That was easily the best episode of the past two seasons, so far. @KarinKonoval deserves an Emmy. She was absolutely brilliant.
953854815523651585 2018-01-17 05:01:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XFilesNews I think he did. Could the title "Plus One" also allude to another baby on the way? Just sayin'.
953849219781046273 2018-01-17 04:39:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XFilesNews The real question is: Are they more magical than Agent Einstein's pills?

952789624874704896 2018-01-14 06:28:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @yvonnehew1 That ending, unfortunately, reminded me of the infamous Rahim Moore misplay several years ago. I will never get it out of my head. I still can't believe Denver lost that game to Baltimore!

950952988801081344 2018-01-09 04:50:35 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AmyNovondo I'm still trying to figure out where @YouTube "acted accordingly." The video was up for a day, garnered millions of views, and they did nothing. This is all about their bottom line. If a much lesser known channel did anything remotely similar, it would've already been terminated.
950878937042771969 2018-01-09 23:56:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> @yvonnehew1 I don't know if it's possible to do any worse than Brock Olivo. The special teams were an absolute disaster. They can only go up from here (hopefully).

943662912073228288 2017-12-20 02:02:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> Ah, yes, "Ice." One of the best episodes of @thexfiles based on one of the best horror movies ever made, @TheHorrorMaster's "The Thing." #TheXFiles
942476434810867712 2017-12-17 19:27:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nflnetwork @Broncos For those who missed the special, the complete ranking was: 10. @VonMiller 9. @KarlMecklenburg 8. Randy Gradishar 7. @TheREALrodSmith 6. @SteveAtwater27 5. Peyton Manning 4. @champbailey 3. @ShannonSharpe 2. @Terrell_Davis 1. @johnelway
940061638845022208 2017-12-10 03:32:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> Damn, @WalkingDead_AMC.
940035073172111360 2017-12-10 01:46:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @yvonnehew1 For the first time since 1992, the @Broncos were on both sides of a shut out for a single season. There has a certainty been a number of historical quirks this year.
939211463180169216 2017-12-08 19:13:57 UTC <LukeSoroko> @elfinaluk I just have to say, you were one bad-ass angel on @cw_spn! I wish we could've seen more of your character!

938984212471808000 2017-12-07 04:10:56 UTC <LukeSoroko> @cw_spn @ella_may6 You were great! That episode ended on one hell of a twist!
935221750270279680 2017-11-27 19:00:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @alicethebee What's your favorite Christmas movie?
934188217988890624 2017-11-24 22:33:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TIME @rosemcgowan @aureliasaid Voted.
933448536573689857 2017-11-22 21:34:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GWARofficial @FreshOffABC @chineseguy88 @amelieg @sanjayshah @EricaOyama  Please find a way to bring GWAR on the show next season! Possible premise: Eddie and his friends try to get into a GWAR concert, after obtaining the idea from the "Beavis And Butthead" video game on Super NES. Just a thought!
933167947295596544 2017-11-21 02:59:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Whoa, @GWARofficial on @FreshOffABC?!? Hell to the yes.
931389126112198656 2017-11-16 05:10:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @H_A_kinani You were great on @cw_spn!
930911984299556865 2017-11-15 21:34:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> @KarinKonoval I'm excited to see you back on @thexfiles!
929933245747048449 2017-11-12 04:45:37 UTC <LukeSoroko> @yvonnehew1 Maybe that's the silver lining in all of this. We won't have to indulge in any false optimism this season, as we know the team is garbage. We won't have to worry about our blood pressure as much. We can just sit back, relax, and not get our hopes up with this clown show.
929797060617834496 2017-11-12 19:44:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AmyNovondo Ditto.
928853163012001793 2017-11-09 05:13:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> @LegendsOfGotham @warnerbrostv @FOXTV @GothamAddicts @GothamTVPodcast @GothamFilming @GothamTVWriters @DCComics @myspiritdances You were awesome! I wish we could've seen more of your character. You certainly left your mark!
928137142403923969 2017-11-07 05:48:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> @JasonCicci @CadyDidTVShow @CadyHuffman I'm assuming you have to live in New York City to be an extra on the series, right? Or, how does that work?
927420901473189888 2017-11-05 06:22:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tonight's #CurbYourEnthusiasm was comedy gold, with a number of great guest stars - @andreasavage @edbegleyjr @MsJuneDiane @Elizbethperkins.
927020488957640704 2017-11-04 03:51:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Avalanche Hell of a game!
924505898835329024 2017-10-28 05:19:17 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AmyNovondo I'm watching @Gotham. Are you going to find yourself with a pig's head anytime soon? ;)
923426661940334592 2017-10-25 05:50:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> @gamespot @GSUniverse I did. I even attended the "Gargoyles" reunion panel at @DenverComicCon a couple of years ago.
920547577598111745 2017-10-18 07:10:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @_FaithLogan Angelic (especially with that light)!
919424149981765632 2017-10-14 04:46:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> @YNB @nbcsnl Emmy-worthy performance. That was brilliant.
918691092182138880 2017-10-12 04:13:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> @NerdAlertNews @cw_spn Solid season premiere.
917293437451247616 2017-10-09 07:39:32 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AnneBedian Seeing you on "Curb Your Enthusiasm" again was a real treat!
917284694026199041 2017-10-09 07:04:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GiveTeeLA @HBO @breedawool That was one of the best episodes of the entire TV series! You were great!
915794839085580288 2017-10-04 04:24:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies fall to the @Dbacks, 11-8, in the National League Wild Card Game. Season over.
914273954994561024 2017-09-30 23:41:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> For the first time since 2009, the @Rockies are going to the playoffs! They'll face the @Dbacks in the National League Wild Card Game.
912803371785924608 2017-09-26 22:17:37 UTC <LukeSoroko> Go see the theatrical debut of "Jeepers Creepers 3" tonight! If the movie does well, @RealNickiAycox may appear in the next installment!
908736246041657345 2017-09-15 16:56:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> @RealNickiAycox Will do!
908508028239876097 2017-09-14 01:49:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> @RealNickiAycox Indeed! I wish you were in it, though!
907476028884316160 2017-09-11 05:28:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos opened their regular season with a 24-21 win over the @Chargers. The game ended up being a lot closer than it should've been.
902978546410242048 2017-08-30 19:37:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> The final issue of @IDWPublishing's main @thexfiles comic, written by @joeharris, comes out today. Pick it up.
902710642255085568 2017-08-29 01:52:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> Thanks again, @abarbeau, @justanactor & @JoeyLaurenAdams. I'm glad I met you all at @cscomiccon! That '80s panel with @zwgman was great too!pic.twitter.com/ulvII87ICG
901915915763105792 2017-08-27 21:14:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> I had a blast at @cscomiccon! I attended a couple of panels and met @abarbeau, @justanactor and @JoeyLaurenAdams, who were all very kind.
901155347678679040 2017-08-25 18:52:32 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm off to @cscomiccon!
898677070158413824 2017-08-18 22:44:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> At 6 p.m. MT, on @party934, I'll air my interview with @abarbeau (star of @Daniel_Knauf's "Carnivle"). See her at @cscomiccon next weekend!
896262668163534848 2017-08-11 06:50:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Denverite Nice! How long were you in Denver before moving to Los Angeles?
894398444906741760 2017-08-06 03:23:01 UTC <LukeSoroko> @SHO_TwinPeaks @KelseyBohlen You were great!
892192682830733314 2017-07-31 01:18:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> @SHO_PR @SHO_TwinPeaks @zmclane I very much enjoyed it!  You certainly had a memorable scene. #TurkeyJerky
890080955372781568 2017-07-25 05:26:51 UTC <LukeSoroko> @kathrynmalia I concur! Hell, I may actually sign up for @netflix if it picked up @iamalmostasian. Right now, I just get my media needs from the library.
886783640348360704 2017-07-16 03:04:30 UTC <LukeSoroko> @LaLloronadeLA Your performance on @SHO_TwinPeaks was breathtaking. I got chills listening to your amazing voice.
886751893778812928 2017-07-16 00:58:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> Get ready for the season seven premiere of @GameOfThrones on @HBO! #WinterIsHere
886350794781577218 2017-07-15 22:24:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia Nice!
886040508010811392 2017-07-14 01:51:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia If you want to see one of the biggest influences on George Lucas and @starwars, check out Kurosawa's "The Hidden Fortress."
886040244319121408 2017-07-14 01:50:30 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia As far as Kurosawa goes, he was the master of jidaigeki films, which have been major influences on all sorts of directors.
886039857319030785 2017-07-14 01:48:58 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia However, I'd argue "Once Upon A Time In The West" is Leone's best film. In fact, I'd argue it's the best film ever made.
886039719871729666 2017-07-14 01:48:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" is the last film in "The Man With No Name Trilogy," and it's Leone's most well-known film.
886039361388675072 2017-07-14 01:47:00 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia The first film in "The Man With No Name Trilogy" is "A Fistful Of Dollars," which is basically a recreation of Kurosawa's "Yojimbo."
886039096631623680 2017-07-14 01:45:57 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk @meeksmedia Leone was the master of the spaghetti western (my favorite film genre). Directed "The Man With No Name Trilogy" a.k.a. "The Dollars Trilogy"
886035617053896704 2017-07-14 01:32:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk Alfred Hitchcock is one of the three greatest directors of all-time, in my opinion (the other two being Sergio Leone and Akira Kurosawa).
885712016769392640 2017-07-13 04:06:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TomEScott @andreasavage @truTV @HelloLyndon I just finished watching the third episode, on demand. Friggen hilarious! #ImSorryTV #AssCubes
885346745508560896 2017-07-12 03:54:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> @truTV @andreasavage I very much enjoyed it! I'm now cognizant of "jalapeo hands." #ImSorryTV #TheMoreYouKnow
884504699134775296 2017-07-10 20:08:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> @joeharris I would definitely buy one if I could be there (or online, perhaps?). I've purchased every issue, and nearly every cover, of the comic.
884149136337117188 2017-07-09 20:35:55 UTC <LukeSoroko> @danielwuyanzu @latimes @MorganicInk I just got blocked by @PLenkov for mentioning the article. That says more about him than anything else.
884134231429042176 2017-07-09 19:36:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @danielwuyanzu @latimes @MorganicInk That was an excellent article. Hopefully, @PLenkov reads it. The explanation he gave on @CBS' @HawaiiFive0CBS controversy was insulting.
882060076256808960 2017-07-03 02:14:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> @julieannemery Have you been singing for a long time, or did you just start getting into it for @PreacherAMC?
882058467913105410 2017-07-03 02:08:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> @julieannemery You were terrific! I'm really enjoying this season of @PreacherAMC, so far.
881965964065165314 2017-07-03 20:00:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AmalieHoward Any of the three @BacktotheFuture movies.
880268135697444864 2017-06-28 03:34:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Tracyphillips66 You were great on @SHO_TwinPeaks! A short-lived, but memorable, role! @sonofbum should be proud (as I'm sure he is).
878031380487127040 2017-06-22 23:26:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> You're welcome!
873385410172473344 2017-06-09 03:44:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> Ditto. When it comes to annoying sounds, the leaf blower is the biggest challenger to @JimCarrey's "most annoying sound in the world."
871532045033275393 2017-06-04 01:00:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tune in to @AMC_TV for the season three premiere of @FearTWD.
869655329688211457 2017-05-30 20:42:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Darshelle_ @OJessicaNigri Wowza!
868727399470555136 2017-05-28 07:15:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> @LauraKeeney I see you snagged "Revenge Of The Ninja." Nice! That's my favorite movie in "The Ninja Trilogy."
868345082486902785 2017-05-26 05:56:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @iamalmostasian @kathrynmalia Brilliant, as always!
866769319912460290 2017-05-22 21:34:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> @cscomiccon Awesome! I loved @abarbeau in "Carnivle," which I feel is the best @HBO series ever made.
866450862310293504 2017-05-21 00:29:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tonight, @SHO_TwinPeaks makes its long-awaited return. #TheOwlsAreNotWhatTheySeem
864317155654991872 2017-05-15 03:10:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> At last, the official birth of Saul Goodman on @BetterCallSaul.
863540526632636417 2017-05-13 23:44:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nbc @kathrynmalia @iamalmostasian You're now our only hope with your pilot! Hopefully, you'll find a network more open-minded than @NBC.
863540271518273538 2017-05-13 23:43:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nbc @kathrynmalia @iamalmostasian So, @NBC rejected the first potential #mixedrace #hapa comedic series, @kourtneykang's "Where I'm From."
863531376934617088 2017-05-13 23:08:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nbc @kourtneykang @IsabellaKRusso I'm half white/half Korean, and I was really hoping that show got picked up. If @NBC doesn't reconsider, could another network acquire it?
861437675571728384 2017-05-07 04:28:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @alicethebee Calbee is a Japanese company with business ties to China. I've tried a variation of the first snack. I liked it!
861054217305370624 2017-05-06 03:04:57 UTC <LukeSoroko> @KattShea1 I just watched "Psycho III," and I thought you were great! It surpasses "Psycho II." I can't believe you had to lay in real ice!
859611398367846400 2017-05-02 03:31:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> Holy shit, @CW_TheFlash.
859593586987474948 2017-05-02 02:20:56 UTC <LukeSoroko> @schuylerfisk I think I just spotted you in a new @marshalls commercial. That, or you have a doppelganger.
858044901094805507 2017-04-28 19:47:00 UTC <LukeSoroko> @msaliahn You were terrific on @cw_spn! I wish we could've seen more of you, but you certainly left your mark, especially with destroying the Colt!
856689312016060416 2017-04-24 02:00:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> Time for the last check-in to "Bates Motel."
856580084697837571 2017-04-24 18:46:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TJEldredge09 No, 2002 was correct. The @Rockies didn't sweep, nor win a series, over the @SFGiants in 2012.
856275861967974405 2017-04-23 22:37:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies blanked the @SFGiants, 8-0, to cap off their first three-game home sweep of their NL West rival in 15 years.
855653068276412416 2017-04-21 05:22:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @katiemusic You were awesome!
855232182150873089 2017-04-20 01:30:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk Same here. In fact, I'd argue season six has the best collection of standalone episodes ("Triangle," "Drive," "Monday," "Arcadia," etc.).
855228106797436928 2017-04-20 01:14:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MorganicInk pic.twitter.com/6LRaPkwyxJ
854468774908579840 2017-04-18 22:56:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> @theblackwhiskyu @thebritsheridan Tough to choose just one. I'd say my favorites are, "Don't Take That Away From Me," "Love Comes And Goes" and "Time Heals Everything."
853813901846347776 2017-04-16 03:34:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Paco_Cabezas @TheRealAlGough I see @MorganicInk has @thexfiles' "The Post-Modern Prometheus" as her @Twitter header. I'm already a fan.
852659353417113601 2017-04-13 23:06:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @alicethebee Mix tomato soup with ramen noodles. It may not seem appetizing, but trust me, it's the best food combination ever. EVER.
851615802461761536 2017-04-10 02:00:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> "It's showtime, folks!" Season three of @BetterCallSaul begins now on @AMC_TV.
851171537994616832 2017-04-09 20:34:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @theblackwhiskyu @thebritsheridan I just listened to the album in its entirety. Well done! By the way, @iTunes mistakenly listed the record's release date as April 1, 2016.

838167004750176256 2017-03-04 23:19:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @kathrynmalia @CIFF Hey, @DenverFilm, please follow suit. @iamalmostasian is fantastic and a much-needed inclusion for diverse programming.
833873982793342979 2017-02-20 03:00:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> The final season of "Bates Motel" is, officially, underway.
831374010998980609 2017-02-13 05:26:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> A shorthanded @nuggets squad beat the @warriors, 132-110, and in the process, tied an @NBA record with 24 made three-pointers in a game.
819683961492348933 2017-01-12 23:14:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @nuggets smash the @Pacers, 140-112, in London. 140 points is the most ever scored in an @NBA game outside of North America.
817237598481580033 2017-01-05 05:13:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> @feliciaday Congratulations!
816841452307312640 2017-01-04 02:59:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Get ready for the season 12 premiere of @alwayssunny on @FXXNetwork!
815643305975443456 2017-01-01 19:38:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm ringing in the new year by heading to @SportsAuthField to watch the @Broncos take on the @RAIDERS, in each team's regular season finale.

812394446625116160 2016-12-23 20:28:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XBIZ @AnnaBellPeaksXX Done and/or done.
812138476133122048 2016-12-22 03:31:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> @truTVjokers Woohoo!
811790780067102720 2016-12-21 04:29:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> @steveyeun Happy Birthday!
810642319221358592 2016-12-18 00:26:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> Three turnovers, numerous drops and atrocious offensive line play doom the @Broncos, in a 16-3 home loss to the @Patriots.
810641598652514304 2016-12-18 00:23:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> @JordaNorwood with a fumble. How fitting.
810638900670713856 2016-12-18 00:12:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> What an incredibly stupid penalty by @BossWard43.
810637257090760704 2016-12-18 00:05:57 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' offense in the second half has been offensive.
810634801065656321 2016-12-18 23:56:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> Third field goal of the day for Stephen Gostkowski.
810627567946518528 2016-12-18 23:27:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> Of course, @DemaryiusT drops a big pass.
810626856835842048 2016-12-18 23:24:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> Another field goal for Stephen Gostkowski.
810626302508146688 2016-12-18 23:22:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> A botched snap is recovered by Tom Brady. Every bounce in this game, so far, has gone the @Patriots' way.
810622359405232128 2016-12-18 23:06:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Patriots' offense also goes three-and-out, on their first possession of the second half.
810620357275160576 2016-12-18 22:58:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> The offense for the @Broncos goes three-and-out to start the second half.
810610639207092224 2016-12-18 22:20:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Patriots capitalize on the turnover, via a @LG_Blount touchdown run, on second-and-goal.
810603522777645056 2016-12-18 21:51:54 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thekidmcmanus ties the game with a 33-yard field goal.
810600566019727360 2016-12-18 21:40:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos have an ugly habit of passing short of the line to gain.
810599613275246592 2016-12-18 21:36:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> Stephen Gostkowski makes a 45-yard field goal to give the @Patriots an early lead.
810598291142492161 2016-12-18 21:31:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> Unreal. @JordaNorwood muffs the punt return, giving the ball back to the @Patriots.
810597792766947328 2016-12-18 21:29:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Patriots receive the opening kickoff, and the @Broncos' defense forces a three-and-out.

809863053638443008 2016-12-16 20:49:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> @NBAMemes The @nuggets.
809625964766494720 2016-12-15 05:07:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GillianA Haha!
808567249615331328 2016-12-12 07:00:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TIME You're missing "Super Mario RPG: Legend Of The Seven Stars."
808056356246843393 2016-12-11 21:10:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos lose an ugly affair to the @Titans, 13-10. Their record now stands at 8-5, with three games left in the regular season.
808055032860045312 2016-12-11 21:05:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> With less than one minute remaining in the game, @AJ_Derby fumbles the ball. @Daymo03 recovers it.
808050599375867904 2016-12-11 20:47:30 UTC <LukeSoroko> @b_fowler13 drops a potential touchdown pass.
808049888894341120 2016-12-11 20:44:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> Great catch by @DemaryiusT.
808046796459175937 2016-12-11 20:32:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> Finally, the @Broncos get on the scoreboard, as @TrevorSiemian locates @ESanders_10 in the end zone.
808044463125839872 2016-12-11 20:23:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> On fourth-and-goal, the @Broncos go for it, but fail to score a touchdown.
808042205696888832 2016-12-11 20:14:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos execute a fake punt for a first down, as @RileyTDixon92 finds @CodyLatimer14 for a 16-yard completion.
808031328759382017 2016-12-11 19:30:55 UTC <LukeSoroko> With over a minute remaining until halftime, @ryansuccop kicks a 41-yard field goal.
808028085492781056 2016-12-11 19:18:02 UTC <LukeSoroko> Thankfully, @ChrisHarrisJr is back in the game.
808026859002875904 2016-12-11 19:13:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> A cheap shot by @HDouglas83 results in an injury to @ChrisHarrisJr.
808024538650910721 2016-12-11 19:03:57 UTC <LukeSoroko> @VicLombardi That was reminiscent of a play the @Panthers drew up against the @Broncos in @superbowl50.
808018789065523200 2016-12-11 18:41:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> There isn't a team worse in short-yardage situations than the @Broncos.
808016195358248961 2016-12-11 18:30:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> Following the turnover, the @Titans add to their lead, via a @ryansuccop 53-yard field goal.
808015331470036993 2016-12-11 18:27:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> The bad start continues for the @Broncos, as @JForsett coughs up the ball.
808013528372232192 2016-12-11 18:20:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> Meanwhile, the @Broncos' defense gives up a touchdown to the @Titans on their first offensive possession.
808010825235656704 2016-12-11 18:09:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> Awful play calling to start the game for the @Broncos. They had two downs to pick up one yard, and fail to do so, as they THROW both times.
807813718381838336 2016-12-10 05:06:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Avalanche Embarrassing.

806666908103753729 2016-12-07 01:09:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tonight, @impastortv and @SouthPark conclude their seasons.
805990565720576000 2016-12-05 04:21:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nuggets Shibby.
805520219384979457 2016-12-04 21:12:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> In @PaxtonLynch's second @NFL start, he passed for only 104 yards, but the @Broncos still took down the @Jaguars, 20-10.
805519212458418180 2016-12-04 21:08:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Second field goal of the day for @thekidmcmanus.
805518311878434818 2016-12-04 21:05:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> Fumble! @BBortles5 coughs up the ball, and @StingRay56 recovers it!
805511788448124928 2016-12-04 20:39:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> This time, the @Broncos' defense stops the @Jaguars' offense on fourth down.
805508009904504833 2016-12-04 20:24:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> Wow, @Broncos. How do you allow @BBortles5 to scamper for a 22-yard touchdown on fourth down?
805500311410450432 2016-12-04 19:53:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> Pick-six, compliments of @BradRoby_1!
805498791197638656 2016-12-04 19:47:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> Much like the beginning of the game, the offenses for the @Jaguars and the @Broncos open the second half by going three-and-out.
805493040211226624 2016-12-04 19:24:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Just before halftime, @thekidmcmanus kicks a 32-yard field goal.
805488389587947520 2016-12-04 19:06:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ChrisHarrisJr picks off @BBortles5!
805486258998939649 2016-12-04 18:57:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> A strong effort by @dbook23, on second-and-goal, results in a rushing touchdown.
805483155067203584 2016-12-04 18:45:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Jaguars get on the scoreboard first, via a @JayMy_31 47-yard field goal.
805480456082825216 2016-12-04 18:34:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Scoreless opening quarter.
805474850483695616 2016-12-04 18:12:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> The offenses for the @Broncos and the @Jaguars go three-and-out to start the game.
805473011457462272 2016-12-04 18:05:05 UTC <LukeSoroko> A lot of @Broncos fans at @EverBankField.
805207410415665152 2016-12-03 00:29:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @darcydonavan No problem!

804565608473890816 2016-12-01 05:59:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> @davidduchovny @XFilesNews Haha, that's great!
803841103174762497 2016-11-29 06:00:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tune in to @ComedyCentral for the season eight finale of "Tosh.0."
803109535002963968 2016-11-27 05:33:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> Ultimately, poor special teams play, along with the defense's inability to stop the @Chiefs late, cost the @Broncos the game.
803109349010849792 2016-11-27 05:32:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> Are you kidding me?!? A 34-yard @cairosantos19 field goal attempt bounces off the upright, and in, to give the @Chiefs a 30-27 victory.
803105911296454656 2016-11-27 05:19:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> Two-minute warning. The @Broncos are driving.
803104423744520192 2016-11-27 05:13:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Once again, the game is tied, as @cairosantos19 converts a 37-yard field goal.
803101225998831616 2016-11-27 05:00:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the ball first in overtime, and get a 44-yard field goal from @thekidmcmanus.
803098267940634624 2016-11-27 04:48:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> The game is going to overtime.
803096990561292288 2016-11-27 04:43:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> With 12 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, the @Chiefs score a touchdown and convert a game-tying two-point conversion.
803093446852575232 2016-11-27 04:29:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> 76-yard touchdown pass from @TrevorSiemian to @b_fowler13!

803085652703133697 2016-11-27 03:58:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> This has been a night to forget for the @Broncos' special teams, as @JordaNorwood muffs a punt return, giving the ball to the @Chiefs.
803082796994625536 2016-11-27 03:47:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> A terrible special teams penalty, during a field goal attempt, allows the @Chiefs to score a drive-extending touchdown.
803078475875631105 2016-11-27 03:30:03 UTC <LukeSoroko> On third-and-goal, @TrevorSiemian finds Jordan Taylor in the end zone.
803074745986150400 2016-11-27 03:15:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' defense forces the @Chiefs' offense to go three-and-out to begin the second half.
803068624424632321 2016-11-27 02:50:55 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 First sack for @Millerlite40.
803068035216994304 2016-11-27 02:48:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> With under two minutes remaining until halftime, @thekidmcmanus makes a 33-yard field goal.
803066243360104448 2016-11-27 02:41:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ESanders_10 is one of the toughest players in the @NFL.
803064968216215552 2016-11-27 02:36:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> And now, the @Chiefs return the free kick for a touchdown. Ugh.
803063984962215936 2016-11-27 02:32:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Chiefs get on the scoreboard first, via a safety.
803060279676375040 2016-11-27 02:17:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> Good to see @KapriBibbs back in the game.
803056849700421632 2016-11-27 02:04:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' offense has struggled in converting third-and-short situations this year.
803056213466423296 2016-11-27 02:01:36 UTC <LukeSoroko> Damn, I felt that @Stuntman1429 hit on @KapriBibbs from my living room. Hopefully, he's OK.
803052888272543745 2016-11-27 01:48:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> @VicLombardi He also goes overboard with his flopping.
803051955920707584 2016-11-27 01:44:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Awful punt by @RileyTDixon92.
803050569237544960 2016-11-27 01:39:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> The offense for the @Chiefs also goes three-and-out on their first possession.
803049589561495552 2016-11-27 01:35:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the opening kickoff, and surprise, surprise, the offense goes three-and-out.
802730229030678529 2016-11-26 04:26:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @cubuffs @RunRalphieRun Woohoo!

801285732509708288 2016-11-22 04:46:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> Despite @JimmyButler doing his best @manuginobili impression in late-game flopping, the @nuggets beat the @chicagobulls, 110-107.

797911240668377089 2016-11-13 21:17:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos edge the @Saints, 25-23, on a wild finish. They'll head into the bye week at 7-3.

795521261107609600 2016-11-06 07:00:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DenverChannel @TroyRenck Damn.
795488233299869702 2016-11-06 04:49:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos lose an ugly affair to the @RAIDERS, 30-20. The defense allowed over 200 yards rushing. Unacceptable.

795483944921792512 2016-11-06 04:32:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos answer with a 69-yard catch-and-run touchdown from @KapriBibbs.

795453054732615680 2016-11-06 02:29:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> FINALLY, the @Broncos get a first down, via a tremendous @DemaryiusT third-down catch.

794621898999140352 2016-11-04 19:26:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> @StaceyofGotham Happy Birthday!
794408471600852992 2016-11-03 05:18:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> @alannarizzo Ugly game, but at least, @RunRalphieRun won.
794039980997820419 2016-11-02 04:54:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> For the first time in 108 years, the @Cubs have won the World Series.
793669152867094528 2016-11-01 04:20:46 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ChelseaClinton I attended your rally here in Aurora, Colorado. You were great!
792873569466265600 2016-10-30 23:39:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos defeat the @Chargers, 27-19. Another divisional test awaits them, next Sunday night, against the @RAIDERS.
792872097802399744 2016-10-30 23:33:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> Turnover on downs!
792870430260408320 2016-10-30 23:26:56 UTC <LukeSoroko> That was @RileyTDixon92's best punt of the season, so far, especially given the circumstances.
792869235143774210 2016-10-30 23:22:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> Huge goal-line stand by the @Broncos' defense.
792868025137455104 2016-10-30 23:17:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> For the first time in 22 games, the @Broncos' defense has allowed a 100-yard rusher (@Melvingordon25).
792866963160576000 2016-10-30 23:13:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> Unfortunately, the @Broncos have to settle for a field goal.
792865761173700609 2016-10-30 23:08:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tremendous catch by @DemaryiusT. The @Broncos have the ball on the @Chargers' four-yard-line.
792864051122491392 2016-10-30 23:01:35 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TrevorSiemian's pass goes off of @JordaNorwood's hands, leading to a pick-six. The @Chargers' two-point try is unsuccessful.
792862687596191744 2016-10-30 22:56:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> First career sack for @jsimms1119.
792860104081022976 2016-10-30 22:45:54 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos answer with a touchdown drive of their own, spanning 75 yards.
792857278051258368 2016-10-30 22:34:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Following @dbook23's fumble, the @Chargers go on a 98-yard touchdown drive. @MOOCHIE048 blocks the extra point.
792852628912734209 2016-10-30 22:16:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> This time, however, the @Broncos are unable to capitalize on the turnover, as @dbook23 fumbles the ball on a catch-and-run.
792851907542867968 2016-10-30 22:13:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> And now, @BossWard43 picks off Philip Rivers!
792851236475117568 2016-10-30 22:10:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos capitalize on the turnover, via a three-yard @dbook23 touchdown run. They lead the @NFL in points off turnovers.
792850366798848004 2016-10-30 22:07:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> @darianstewart26 intercepts Philip Rivers!
792844809538969600 2016-10-30 21:45:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> @JoshuaLambo2 misses a 45-yard field goal attempt.
792843051982913536 2016-10-30 21:38:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> @MelvinIngram strip-sacks @TrevorSiemian. @palepoi95 recovers the ball.
792842052278980608 2016-10-30 21:34:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Nice diving catch by @ESanders_10.
792837558761771008 2016-10-30 21:16:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> Pick-six, compliments of @BradRoby_1!
792834779204857856 2016-10-30 21:05:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 First sack of the game for @Millerlite40.
792825189474062336 2016-10-30 20:27:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> Just like in their initial meeting this season, the @Broncos' defense allows the @Chargers to score a touchdown on their first drive.
792821987802349568 2016-10-30 20:14:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the opening kickoff, and march down the field, but they settle for a 28-yard @thekidmcmanus field goal.
792587615224500224 2016-10-29 04:43:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> Unbelievable choke job by the @nuggets.
792508127220371457 2016-10-29 23:27:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm heading to @Pepsi_Center for the @nuggets' regular season home opener. @officialmutombo will have his #55 jersey retired.

791399594437386240 2016-10-26 22:02:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> Tonight, the @nuggets tip off their regular season, on the road, versus the @PelicansNBA.
791145212412325893 2016-10-25 05:11:32 UTC <LukeSoroko> @XFilesNews Excellent TV series.
790759411098660865 2016-10-24 03:38:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> In @bosweiler17's return to Denver, he was held to 131 passing yards and zero touchdowns, as the @Broncos beat the @HoustonTexans, 27-9.
790757452182540289 2016-10-24 03:30:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> Second field goal of the game for @thekidmcmanus.
790756204884598784 2016-10-24 03:25:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @HoustonTexans go for it on fourth-and-10 from their own 34-yard-line, and @Derek_Wolfe95 bats down @bosweiler17's pass.
790753815028871169 2016-10-24 03:16:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> Drops continue to be an issue for @DemaryiusT.
790750388936814592 2016-10-24 03:02:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> Following the @HoustonTexans' second turnover, the @Broncos notch a field goal.
790749033836847104 2016-10-24 02:57:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @bosweiler17 fumbles the ball, as it slips out of his hand. @ChrisHarrisJr recovers for the @Broncos.
790747168000749568 2016-10-24 02:49:50 UTC <LukeSoroko> It's also the first touchdown the @Broncos have scored in the third quarter this season.
790746919429545984 2016-10-24 02:48:51 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos capitalize on the turnover, as @dbook23 gets the first rushing touchdown of his @NFL career.
790745859159797760 2016-10-24 02:44:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> @darianstewart26 forces a fumble of Alfred Blue; @BamBamDavis53 recovers the ball.
790742628346175489 2016-10-24 02:31:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> Not a good punt by @RileyTDixon92.
790741076692774912 2016-10-24 02:25:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> On the @HoustonTexans' first offensive drive of the second half, they add another field goal.
790737739968753668 2016-10-24 02:12:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' offense opens the second half by going three-and-out.
790734174739050496 2016-10-24 01:58:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Gary Kubiak's approach in closing out the first half was way too conservative.
790730511089938432 2016-10-24 01:43:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> On third-and-goal, @TrevorSiemian throws a dart to @DemaryiusT in the end zone.
790726480124796928 2016-10-24 01:27:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos get on the scoreboard, via a @cjandersonb22 seven-yard touchdown run.

790719845469786112 2016-10-24 01:01:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> @9nicknovak makes a 43-yard field goal.
790714155346997248 2016-10-24 00:38:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> The offense for the @Broncos also goes three-and-out on their first drive.
790713059291521024 2016-10-24 00:34:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' defense forces the @HoustonTexans to go three-and-out on their opening offensive possession.
790459181039951872 2016-10-24 07:45:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> @steveyeun You'll be missed on @WalkingDead_AMC. Glenn was my favorite character. We need more Asian representation on television.
790357304675700736 2016-10-23 01:00:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Time to check out the season seven premiere of @WalkingDead_AMC.

788619837966807040 2016-10-18 05:56:35 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AviQuijada Great movie.
788231483911569408 2016-10-17 04:13:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Avalanche Hoody hoo!
787509704561831937 2016-10-15 04:25:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Avalanche opened their regular season with a 6-5 victory over the @DallasStars. @Joe_Colborne notched his first career hat trick.

786775875199000576 2016-10-13 03:49:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' @NFL-record 15-game road winning streak, within the division, is snapped, as they lose an ugly affair to the @Chargers, 21-13.
786775605597483009 2016-10-13 03:48:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> A Hail Mary throw by @TrevorSiemian falls short of the end zone.
786772836236963840 2016-10-13 03:37:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos recover an onside kick attempt.
786772051377790976 2016-10-13 03:34:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> With 27 seconds left, @thekidmcmanus kicks a 46-yard field goal.
786769335423344641 2016-10-13 03:23:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos march into @Chargers territory, but @DemaryiusT fumbles the ball.
786765017978777600 2016-10-13 03:06:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> Finally, the @Broncos reach the end zone, with 8:08 remaining in the game.
786762785757601795 2016-10-13 02:57:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> The free kick is muffed by the @Chargers, giving the ball back to the @Broncos.
786762268440612864 2016-10-13 02:55:16 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos are flagged for offensive holding in the end zone, resulting in a safety.
786759609591541760 2016-10-13 02:44:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thekidmcmanus misses a 56-yard field goal attempt.
786753242541666304 2016-10-13 02:19:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Korey_Toomer forces a fumble of Jordan Taylor.
786751433580306434 2016-10-13 02:12:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Then, the @Broncos' defense immediately allows @Melvingordon25 to run for 48 yards.
786749203078787073 2016-10-13 02:03:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos' offense goes three-and-out to start the second half.
786745519582437376 2016-10-13 01:48:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> Needless to say, that was a rather disconcerting first half for the @Broncos.
786740241298104323 2016-10-13 01:27:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> Unfortunately, the @Broncos are only able to manage a field goal after the turnover.

785246873695072256 2016-10-09 22:33:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @AtlantaFalcons' running backs are killing the @Broncos, with over 100 total yards rushing AND over 100 total yards receiving.

785227748155412480 2016-10-09 21:17:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> @BroncosTV Except, when it comes to stopping the run.
785222467383984128 2016-10-09 20:56:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thekidmcmanus gets the @Broncos on the scoreboard, with a 35-yard field goal.
785216103647543296 2016-10-09 20:31:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> Not a good start for the @Broncos' defense, as they allow the @AtlantaFalcons to extend their lead, via a @Matt_Bryant3 46-yard field goal.

782742836550578176 2016-10-02 00:43:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos dominate the @TBBuccaneers, 27-7, but at a cost, with a left shoulder injury to @TrevorSiemian. Hopefully, it isn't serious.
782741095138533376 2016-10-02 00:36:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> Very sloppy conditions.
782737098889506816 2016-10-02 00:20:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> After a weather delay of over one hour, the @Broncos-@TBBuccaneers game has resumed.
782718225997963264 2016-10-02 23:05:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos-@TBBuccaneers game has been suspended, due to potentially hazardous weather.
782712935449698304 2016-10-02 22:44:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> First career @NFL touchdown pass for @PaxtonLynch, as he finds @ESanders_10 in the end zone.
782710883117957120 2016-10-02 22:36:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> A chant of, "Let's go, @Broncos!" has broken out at @RJStadium.
782703679329542144 2016-10-02 22:07:53 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos come out of halftime, and march down the field, but they end up settling for another @thekidmcmanus field goal.
782696580361039872 2016-10-02 21:39:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> Just before halftime, @thekidmcmanus converts a 38-yard field goal.
782693274146320384 2016-10-02 21:26:32 UTC <LukeSoroko> Fuuuuuuuck. @TrevorSiemian is hurt. Rookie @PaxtonLynch is now in the game.
782692551522291712 2016-10-02 21:23:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Fumble! @Billy_Boi_90 recovers!
782686261475549184 2016-10-02 20:58:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> Once again, the @Broncos capitalize on the turnover -- this time, on a short @cjandersonb22 touchdown run.
782684348302581760 2016-10-02 20:51:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> Another interception for Aqib Talib!
782678443120926720 2016-10-02 20:27:36 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Jaboowins gets away from the @Broncos' pass rush, and scores a touchdown with his legs.
782674544087576576 2016-10-02 20:12:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos immediately capitalize on the turnover, as @TrevorSiemian connects with @DemaryiusT for a touchdown.
782673819290836992 2016-10-02 20:09:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> Interception by Aqib Talib!

781004942639296513 2016-09-27 05:37:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @FedEx @AaronRodgers12 @Jaboowins @NFL345 I voted for @TrevorSiemian.
780648577324285952 2016-09-26 06:01:39 UTC <LukeSoroko> @LCMayhew The best city in the world!
780136980692676608 2016-09-25 20:08:45 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos take down the @Bengals, on the road, 29-17. @TrevorSiemian throws for 312 yards, four touchdowns and zero interceptions.

780131587342020608 2016-09-25 19:47:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> For the first time today, the @Broncos' defense forces the @Bengals' offense to go three-and-out.

780119294189326336 2016-09-25 18:58:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> On the @Broncos' opening offensive possession of the second half, @REALPACMAN24 forces a fumble of @DemaryiusT.
780113593945554944 2016-09-25 18:35:49 UTC <LukeSoroko> Just before halftime, @TrevorSiemian tosses his second touchdown to @ESanders_10. @thekidmcmanus' extra point attempt is blocked.
780110695438233600 2016-09-25 18:24:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> Twice on this drive, @TrevorSiemian has come close to throwing an interception.
780107705360842752 2016-09-25 18:12:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Bengals retake the lead, following their second rushing touchdown of the day.
780103030490341377 2016-09-25 17:53:50 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos capitalize on the @Bengals' turnover, as @TrevorSiemian throws a 41-yard touchdown to @ESanders_10.

780093186949525505 2016-09-25 17:14:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> Awful rushing defense by the @Broncos, on the @Bengals' first offensive drive, results in a touchdown on the ground.
780091661997137921 2016-09-25 17:08:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the opening kickoff and go three-and-out on offense.

778483002686877696 2016-09-20 06:36:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 @MileHighReport Done and/or done.
778035978199928832 2016-09-19 01:00:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> Season three of @Gotham starts now on @FOXTV.
777653111535972352 2016-09-18 23:38:44 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 Another sack by @Millerlite40 to finish the game! The @Broncos defeat the Colts, 34-20.
777651346941980672 2016-09-18 23:31:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 Strip sack by @Millerlite40! @StingRay56 recovers the ball and takes it to the end zone!
777650329361854464 2016-09-18 23:27:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> With under two minutes remaining, @thekidmcmanus makes a 35-yard field goal. The @Colts have no timeouts.
777647109860306945 2016-09-18 23:14:53 UTC <LukeSoroko> Frank Gore tiptoes his way to the end zone, on a seven-yard catch-and-run, and the @Colts cut the @Broncos' lead to 23-20.
777639956776751105 2016-09-18 22:46:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> Pick-six compliments of Aqib Talib!
777637244458774528 2016-09-18 22:35:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos recapture the lead, via a @thekidmcmanus 33-yard field goal.
777634451618541572 2016-09-18 22:24:35 UTC <LukeSoroko> For as good as the @Broncos' defense is, third downs have been an issue, even going back to last season.
777633439579201536 2016-09-18 22:20:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Colts tie the game on a five-yard touchdown run by @RobT_33.
777631379597107200 2016-09-18 22:12:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> Are you kidding me, @Broncos?!? How do you allow Andrew Luck to convert a third-and-20, with his legs?!?
777630620981702656 2016-09-18 22:09:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TroyRenck Damn. Hopefully, the injury isn't serious.
777627143068979200 2016-09-18 21:55:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> Despite out-gaining the @Colts, 294 yards to 72 yards, the @Broncos have scored just seven more points at the half.
777626173081722880 2016-09-18 21:51:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> Second field goal of the day for @thekidmcmanus.
777625413774217216 2016-09-18 21:48:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Nice catch-and-run by @cjandersonb22 for the first down.
777622579439808512 2016-09-18 21:37:25 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Colts capitalize on the turnover, as they add another field goal.
777621390375518208 2016-09-18 21:32:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> @TrevorSiemian is intercepted, with the @Broncos driving. That was a bad play call.
777617917189906432 2016-09-18 21:18:53 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 First sack of the game for @Millerlite40, and first sack of his career vs. Andrew Luck.
777616567173386240 2016-09-18 21:13:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> Touchdown, @Broncos! @cjandersonb22 runs it in from four yards out.
777613306651566080 2016-09-18 21:00:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DemaryiusT has to catch that ball.
777612332268527616 2016-09-18 20:56:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> Back-to-back weeks in which the opposing team's punter drills a punt of over 70 yards.
777610566630125568 2016-09-18 20:49:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> This time, @thekidmcmanus converts, albeit, from a much shorter distance (23 yards).
777608425551175680 2016-09-18 20:41:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Following @thekidmcmanus' missed field goal, the @Colts take advantage of good field position by connecting on a field goal of their own.
777606790892486656 2016-09-18 20:34:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos receive the opening kickoff, but they fail to score, as @thekidmcmanus misses a 54-yard field goal.
777377787183104004 2016-09-17 05:24:42 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies blanked the @Padres, 8-0, at Coors Field. @MrGrayWolf22 pitched brilliantly (CG, 4 H, 0 R, 0 BB, franchise-record 16 K).
777026641620979712 2016-09-16 06:09:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> @espn @RunRalphieRun Haha, that's great!
776658458049339394 2016-09-15 05:46:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GameOfThrones @TITANSofCOSPLAY The resemblance is uncanny!
776283744256692224 2016-09-14 04:57:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> Get ready for the season 20 premiere of @SouthPark on @ComedyCentral!
775512732346949632 2016-09-12 01:53:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> My microwave, which I've had since college, no longer works. All the nights of @ChefBoyardee finally took their toll.
774831289383784448 2016-09-10 04:45:49 UTC <LukeSoroko> @abarbeau Best @HBO series of all-time.
774120804833386497 2016-09-08 05:42:36 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos won and @OSIRISREx successfully launched. This has been a good night.
774008486858416128 2016-09-08 22:16:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> Two big events tonight: @OSIRISREx launches and the @Broncos' regular season kicks off, with a @superbowl50 rematch (I'll be at the game).
773754628303261699 2016-09-07 05:27:33 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Crisadams26 @Rockies Hoody hoo!
773396227413123072 2016-09-06 05:43:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Seahawks @AZCardinals @Panthers @HarrisonNFL @NFL The @Broncos should be #1.
773022952640045057 2016-09-05 05:00:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> "The @ComedyCentral Roast Of @RobLowe" is underway. Peyton Manning is one of the roasters.
772945607585435648 2016-09-05 23:52:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Rockies Tremendous pitching performance by @cbettis35.

762474973566865409 2016-08-07 02:26:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies lost, at home, to the @Marlins, 10-7. Ichiro Suzuki made history by notching his 3,000th @MLB hit, which was a triple.

728467761307865088 2016-05-05 06:13:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies smash the @SFGiants, 17-7, behind a 13-run fifth inning. That's right, 13 runs in one inning, which is a franchise record.
728098204370145280 2016-05-04 05:45:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Well done, @cw_spn.
727737353184358401 2016-05-03 05:51:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @AngeliqueKerber @WTA Voted.
727386907747831808 2016-05-02 06:38:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> My favorite @007 film, "GoldenEye," is on @AMC_TV. Its Nintendo 64 companion is, arguably, the best video game adaptation ever made.
726988895850635264 2016-05-01 04:17:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Rockies Nolan Arenado is, without question, @MLB's best third baseman.
726258815939670017 2016-04-29 03:56:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> Thank you, @NASA and @NASASocial, for providing me the tremendous experience of covering @OSIRISREx!
726045411304038400 2016-04-29 13:48:09 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm off to get a glimpse of @NASA's @OSIRISREx!
724396527708327936 2016-04-24 00:36:05 UTC <LukeSoroko> Wow, what a meltdown by the @Rockies. Hopefully, the season premieres of @GameOfThrones and @SiliconHBO will wash away this bad taste.

721944185884925952 2016-04-17 06:11:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ForTheWin Hell no.
721864230283005952 2016-04-17 00:53:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> Nolan Arenado homers twice, as the @Rockies blank the @Cubs, 2-0, and take the series at Wrigley Field.

720498390606422017 2016-04-13 06:26:17 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @nuggets are the only team to defeat the 72-10 @chicagobulls and the 73-9 @warriors.
719329142278197248 2016-04-10 01:00:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> Season two of @FearTWD begins now on @AMC_TV!
719018487084023808 2016-04-09 04:25:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> Once again, the @Rockies lose at home to the @Padres, this time by a score of 16-3. @Tstory2's home run streak comes to an end.
718679916733005824 2016-04-08 06:00:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> @nuggets Well done.
718602860603117569 2016-04-08 00:54:07 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies drop their home opener, 13-6, to the @Padres. @Tstory2 continues his historic start to the season, with two more home runs.
718314011507482624 2016-04-07 05:46:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @dorkly Nintendo 64.
717999675731681284 2016-04-07 08:57:17 UTC <LukeSoroko> @ComedyCentral I liked the nod to "Mrs. Doubtfire."
717905407511912449 2016-04-06 02:42:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Rockies open 2016 with a series win over the @Dbacks. @Tstory2 is the first player in @MLB history to homer in his first three games.
717795631230636032 2016-04-06 19:26:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles The final issue of @IDWPublishing's "@TheXFiles: Season 11" is out today! Pick it up!
717571872125116416 2016-04-05 04:37:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Rockies That was painful to watch.
717164983998488576 2016-04-04 01:40:31 UTC <LukeSoroko> The 2016 @Rockies regular season is, officially, underway.

707788406332334080 2016-03-09 04:41:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thexfiles @DenverComicCon I picked up both covers of @IDWPublishing's one-shot comic "@TheXFiles: Deviations," by @AmyChu, @LaraWest and @CaliSilvia.
706754436689825792 2016-03-07 08:12:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @CodyTruesdale69 Haha, why those locations?
706557115314208768 2016-03-06 19:08:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> Here's to you, Manning. "Omaha!"
706557050961022976 2016-03-06 19:08:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm also happy that I was in attendance for Manning's final home game, which was this year's AFC Championship Game, at @SportsAuthField.
706556820077195264 2016-03-06 19:07:27 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm glad that Manning was able to ride off into the sunset, with a second @SuperBowl ring.
706556613570596864 2016-03-06 19:06:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> The legendary Peyton Manning has called it a career. In my opinion, he's the second-best quarterback in @NFL history, behind @johnelway.

698059796470083584 2016-02-12 08:23:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> @Broncos @NFL I certainly did!
697300563818475520 2016-02-09 06:06:24 UTC <LukeSoroko> Wow, the latest episode of @CW_TheFlash could've operated as a season finale. So much craziness.
697112312197435392 2016-02-09 17:38:21 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm off to the @Broncos @SuperBowl parade!
696535148221718528 2016-02-07 03:24:54 UTC <LukeSoroko> That's all, folks! For the third time in franchise history, the @Broncos are @SuperBowl champions! Hoody hoo!
696531758343262208 2016-02-07 03:11:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> Second sack of the @SuperBowl for @DeMarcusWare!
696531199385165824 2016-02-07 03:09:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> The two-point conversion is good!
696530472805933056 2016-02-07 03:06:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> Touchdown, @Broncos! @cjandersonb22 runs it in from two yards out!
696529407112916992 2016-02-07 03:02:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 FUCK YEAH! @Millerlite40 IS THE MAN!
696528671406845952 2016-02-07 02:59:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Ultra conservative play call by the @Broncos.
696527171439894528 2016-02-07 02:53:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DemaryiusT slips to the ground, as the @Broncos are now one-of-12 on third downs.
696525641789759488 2016-02-07 02:47:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GrahamGano converts a 39-yard field goal attempt for the @Panthers, following the @Broncos' turnover.
696523421044199424 2016-02-07 02:38:19 UTC <LukeSoroko> Two Peyton Manning fumbles on that possession for the @Broncos. Unfortunately, the @Panthers recovered the second one.
696519011396235265 2016-02-07 02:20:47 UTC <LukeSoroko> Surprise, surprise, @SchoBlue75 allows a sack.
696518135126446080 2016-02-07 02:17:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> @BossWard43 picks off @CameronNewton, then fumbles the ball, but thankfully, the @Broncos recover.
696517473550471168 2016-02-07 02:14:41 UTC <LukeSoroko> How the hell does that happen?!?
696515891710676992 2016-02-07 02:08:23 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos have reached the red zone three times, so far, and they've had to settle for three field goals.
696514064332115968 2016-02-07 02:01:08 UTC <LukeSoroko> @GrahamGano misses a 44-yard field goal on the @Panthers' opening second half possession.
696503642438791168 2016-02-07 01:19:43 UTC <LukeSoroko> @DeMarcusWare sacks @CameronNewton to close out the first half.
696499838909714432 2016-02-07 01:04:36 UTC <LukeSoroko> Fuck. Peyton Manning throws an interception in @Panthers territory.
696499269348433921 2016-02-07 01:02:20 UTC <LukeSoroko> Great run by @cjandersonb22!
696498948446367744 2016-02-07 01:01:04 UTC <LukeSoroko> I've said it before, and I'll say it again, this wouldn't be a @Broncos game without a @DemaryiusT drop.
696498726232154114 2016-02-07 01:00:11 UTC <LukeSoroko> Yes! @darianstewart26 forces a fumble, and @Grindin_59 recovers the ball!
696496877542354945 2016-02-07 00:52:50 UTC <LukeSoroko> @thekidmcmanus notches his second field goal of the day, this time from a yard closer than his first one.
696495936080510977 2016-02-07 00:49:06 UTC <LukeSoroko> @JordaNorwood with a tremendous punt return!
696492179871526912 2016-02-07 00:34:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> A one-yard @Jonathanstewar1 touchdown run gets the @Panthers on the scoreboard.
696491433599979520 2016-02-07 00:31:12 UTC <LukeSoroko> Another Talib penalty....
696487399996567552 2016-02-07 00:15:10 UTC <LukeSoroko> Incredibly stupid penalty from Aqib Talib.
696485710786736129 2016-02-07 00:08:28 UTC <LukeSoroko> @millerlite40 Strip sack by @Millerlite40! @TheMalikJackson recovers the ball in the end zone for a @Broncos defensive touchdown!
696482696248168448 2016-02-07 23:56:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> Three-and-out for the @Panthers on their opening offensive drive.
696481977411604480 2016-02-07 23:53:38 UTC <LukeSoroko> The @Broncos score the first points of the @SuperBowl, via a @thekidmcmanus 34-yard field goal.
696480761369595904 2016-02-07 23:48:48 UTC <LukeSoroko> Peyton Manning completes an 18-yard pass to @owendaniels, on the @Broncos' first offensive snap of the game.
696476086608134145 2016-02-07 23:30:13 UTC <LukeSoroko> Go, @Broncos!

691439407904067584 2016-01-24 01:56:15 UTC <LukeSoroko> @RealNickiAycox You know it! I just got back home after going crazy at the @Broncos game. I'm sore, but it was worth it! On to @thexfiles!
691438962640945152 2016-01-24 01:54:29 UTC <LukeSoroko> For the second time in three years, the @Broncos are @SuperBowl bound!
691316341383389184 2016-01-24 17:47:14 UTC <LukeSoroko> And just like in 2014, I hope the @Broncos come out victorious again!
691316138353913858 2016-01-24 17:46:26 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'll be sporting my @SuperBowl XXXII Steve Atwater jersey, much like I did when I attended the teams' 2014 AFC Championship match-up.
691315949249519616 2016-01-24 17:45:40 UTC <LukeSoroko> I'm off to @SportsAuthField to witness the @Broncos and the @Patriots clash in the AFC Championship Game.

690097394214641664 2016-01-21 09:03:34 UTC <LukeSoroko> @CodyTruesdale69 @Nero I would.
690061588896837632 2016-01-20 06:41:18 UTC <LukeSoroko> Whoa, @cw_spn. That was certainly unexpected.
689601829139656704 2016-01-19 00:14:22 UTC <LukeSoroko> Hell to the yes. I just scored a ticket, at face value, to the AFC Championship Game. I'll be at @SportsAuthField to cheer on the @Broncos!
