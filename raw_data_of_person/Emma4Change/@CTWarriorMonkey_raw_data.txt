970416720333737984 2018-03-04 21:52:30 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> Great news @jongaunt wants to help people. So we can all assume that he wont be charging a penny for any of this. Yes?pic.twitter.com/gFDNGbaTHu
970414894637092875 2018-03-04 21:45:14 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @dawnrankin @jongaunt @chrisdoris53 Anyone who is in favour of fox hunting isn't in a position to call anyone else savages
970413301057323010 2018-03-04 21:38:55 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt is having an operation tomorrow, I wish him well. I hear it's quite a tricky procedure to remove his tongue from Tommy Roninson's arsehole.
970412226308902914 2018-03-04 21:34:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @FLGovScott @DavidBegnaud Shame on them
970411896573710336 2018-03-04 21:33:20 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Emma4Change Well done Emma - we had a school shooting in a place called Dunblane in 1996. Then our Government banned guns. We have had none since. It isn't rocket science. All power to you.
970353705806716928 2018-03-04 17:42:06 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> Or in other words... "I've jumped on the back of people suffering from cancer just so you can get cheap publicity to try and cash in with a grubby little book deal"https://twitter.com/SofieHagen/status/969175614606446594
970353423865524225 2018-03-04 17:40:59 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @SofieHagen Ah I see, so you've jumped on the back of people suffering from cancer just so you can get cheap publicity to try and cash in with a grubby little book deal - shame on you.
970353093257940993 2018-03-04 17:39:40 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @SofieHagen @rebekkarnold I'm fat too because I ate too much haribo and Ben&Jerrys and didn't do near enough exercise, anyone who thinks that is a healthy lifestyle is nuts. I'm off to the gym later to reverse the damage I've done.
970352229629784064 2018-03-04 17:36:14 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @SofieHagen There are people that don't buy into vaccinations, they are still ignoronat morons though. Just because you're not clever enough to understand the science doesn't make it wrong.
970351942630301697 2018-03-04 17:35:06 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @SofieHagen There is more availability of cheap food than ever. If you like being a fat munter, then good for you. But don't give me this bollocks that it's healthy it isn't. I'm off to the gym later to lose the timber I've piled on
970337889476382720 2018-03-04 16:39:15 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @LBC @iainlee @steveallenshow @Shout2YouRadio Ah, I've just heard his voice, now I recognise him. I heard his show when driving the car back from getting off a ferry from france, it was the dullest thing I've ever heard on radio. I had to switch off before he killed me by sending me to sleep on the motorway.
970336743068258305 2018-03-04 16:34:42 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @iainlee @steveallenshow @Shout2YouRadio Oh dear, what a fuckronaut
970335662376448000 2018-03-04 16:30:24 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @steveallenshow @iainlee @fluffmitten I'm the same, I had to check his twitter feed to find out who he was - fucking hell it's dull
970335146254749697 2018-03-04 16:28:21 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @steveallenshow @LBC @Ofcom @iainlee @Flossup He should learn from tha abject humiliation of @jongaunt that trying to bully Iain doesn't work out well for people. Karma has a habit of biting you in the arse and people are more than happy to help it along.
970333804094214144 2018-03-04 16:23:01 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @iainlee @steveallenshow @Shout2YouRadio Was he bad mouthing him on his radio show? I can't see anything on twitter - I've just had a look apparently he's on LBC.He must be on when normal people are asleep.
970333214723190787 2018-03-04 16:20:40 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @steveallenshow I genuinely have no idea who you are so I can only assume that anything you've said about @iainlee comes from a position of jealousy.https://twitter.com/Shout2YouRadio/status/970329827617267713
970331097669292032 2018-03-04 16:12:16 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @andyclosier Jon I thought after you followed someone elses dirt (Dr Moseleys blood sugar diet) you were told by your own doctor to throw your glasses away because you had perfect vision - now you're having an op. BTW posting twice it's your birthday to get good wishes is beyond  pathetic.
970246632561369089 2018-03-04 10:36:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Independent Jesus freaks with guns. That's all the world needs.
970246027914686465 2018-03-04 10:34:14 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @FNTBD It's called supply and demand fella - They are building new homes all over the place where I live there simply aren't enough. It isn't in the governments interest to create a market with no homes because we all have to pay to house them sooner or later.
970011004267581441 2018-03-03 19:00:20 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @thislifetoday @FreezePeach_ I believe he also discovered penicillin

970009908555984899 2018-03-03 18:55:58 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @lulumccoy What about fox hunting?
970009707594371072 2018-03-03 18:55:10 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @HarridgePike @jongaunt @simonbrodie2 Jon loves killing animals for fun. He's a huge fan of foxhunting. So he has no right to complain.
970009320556548101 2018-03-03 18:53:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @thislifetoday @FreezePeach_ I would imagine so.

970008805017837568 2018-03-03 18:51:35 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> So @jongaunt wants some muslims hun from the gallows for inhumanely killing a sheep, then decided that his best course of action to defend his stance is to go "full retard"pic.twitter.com/kBw38YCMH4
970008111678410752 2018-03-03 18:48:50 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @DaiRees5463 Jon clearly doesn't understand what a metaphor is.
970007688460619781 2018-03-03 18:47:09 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> I see that @thislifetoday has had a DM from someone telling him who he is allowed to talk to, what a wimp. Or maybe it's because he realised I trashed his argument - still a wimp.

970003508744409088 2018-03-03 18:30:32 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Jacamo @jongaunt @welshflinty1927 He did it by following a diet developed by Dr Michael Mosely, he was raving about it on his show. Now he wants to cash in on his work. Think about it Gaunt has no knowledge of diet or nutrition, he couldn't possibly develop a diet.
970002707678420992 2018-03-03 18:27:21 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @GrrrGraphics @IAmMikeAlbert @thislifetoday It's none of our business whether they have a left leaning bias or not. they are entitled to any view they want and to have whomever they want on here. You have no "right" to be on twitter so they can ban you for whatever reason they like.
969953551588962305 2018-03-03 15:12:02 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @slc469 The guy is a reactionary clown.
969953233451044864 2018-03-03 15:10:46 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @GrrrGraphics @IAmMikeAlbert @thislifetoday It's people reporting a post as racist. They don't have the man power to actually look at every tweet that gets reported. I got banned for posting a picture because some idiots thought it was racist, when I was actually using it to take the piss out of a racist.
969952908807720962 2018-03-03 15:09:28 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Jacamo @jongaunt @GS17466 LOL - his own diet site, he did the Michael Mosley diet. He admitted it, now he wants to cash in on someone elses work.
969706825485639686 2018-03-02 22:51:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @GrrrGraphics @IAmMikeAlbert @thislifetoday I've been banned before for what I thought was a totally innocuous tweet, but if enough thick retards get offended by it you're gone. It's an automatic algorithm. It isn't a human making these decisions

969673623714844672 2018-03-02 20:39:42 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> I predicted this as soon as they put the 3% stamp duty surcharge on and cut the tax relief. Landlords are providing homes at their risk that the government aren't doing. If landlords all sold up  there would be no homes at all for people to renthttps://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/homeandproperty/experts-warn-of-buy-to-let-crunch-as-landlords-sell-off-unprofitable-properties-and-hike-rents/ar-BBJK8dM?li=AAmiR2Z&ocid=spartandhp

969604902040293376 2018-03-02 16:06:37 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @GrrrGraphics @IAmMikeAlbert @thislifetoday They do, you abide by their rules or you get booted off. Unfortunately most of it is automated, you get enough people complaining about a tweet and a switch gets flicked.
969604557507620864 2018-03-02 16:05:15 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @infowars @TRobinsonNewEra @GilesTonks @LTannister So what part of him stating on his radio show that he voted for Corbyn because he wanted the taxpayers to pick up a 90 grand debt for his kids uni fees was part of him protesting against May?
969559964372164608 2018-03-02 13:08:03 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @GrrrGraphics @IAmMikeAlbert You're absolutely right, these are private companies that we use for free at their invitation.

969499215884947456 2018-03-02 09:06:40 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Michael_Heaver There are way more than 80,000 people in this country that think One direction are talented and Ed Sheeran is edgy.  They are still wrong.
969496326340792320 2018-03-02 08:55:11 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Steven_Woolfe @jongaunt @uk_rants @72holes Jon Gaunt voted Labour in the last election, despite the fact that there was a UKIP constituent standing in his ward. Then again UKIP weren't offering to make hard working taxpayers pay for his kids uni fees.
969291705768964097 2018-03-01 19:22:05 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @infowars @TRobinsonNewEra @LTannister Do you not think the bloke has lost enough money on these ridiculous schemes - Talk2me has been a dismal failure and he burned through at least 200 grand. Stop encouraging him, it's not kind.
969289503566331905 2018-03-01 19:13:20 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @oxwick9 Ask him why he's no longer allowed to braidcast from his studio and why he resigend from his own company.
969289360125448195 2018-03-01 19:12:46 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @oxwick9 No he really doesn't, anyone who pulls him up is labelled a troll, faced with legal threats and when they still won't shut up, threats of violence, like the way he threatened this autistic man on video. https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=1c7_1494751519
969259128714612737 2018-03-01 17:12:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @katelawler Spices have an arbitrary shelf life. I worded in a spice factory once and I was puttling the sell by dates on a batch. Halfway through we ticked into a new month and the next day the rest had a sell by date a month later than the rest of the batch.

Major won the biggest popular vote of any Prime minister in History and took our country out of crippling recession.

968603160188276737 2018-02-27 21:46:03 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @EssexView @Kt_and_Nick @BillySidecar He's right though, anyone can do a podcast, there are absolutely no barriers to entry
968602275080998912 2018-02-27 21:42:32 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @mrjamesob @JuliaHB1 @jongaunt @Iromg @talkRADIO @LBC @EssexView @Kt_and_Nick @ReFindThis I used to listen a lot, but I've heard enough about Brexit for the day by the time I get to 10am.
968601720216485888 2018-02-27 21:40:20 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @EssexView @Kt_and_Nick You're right, it's a bit like watching a football game after you already know the score - what's the point?
968560183545909249 2018-02-27 18:55:17 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @EssexView @Kt_and_Nick Absolutely, you can't interact with a podcast.
968559817685118976 2018-02-27 18:53:50 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @TVKev @LBC @talkRADIO @jongaunt @Kt_and_Nick There's nothing stopping him from ringing in just like anybody else.
968559586125996033 2018-02-27 18:52:54 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @talkRADIO @LBC @EssexView @Kt_and_Nick They've got a great line up now, I even enjoy Eamonn Holmes in the afternoon, but you can't beat @JuliaHB1 and @Iromg in the mornings, they take no prisoners. I can see them really giving LBC a run for their money now.
968559053394923520 2018-02-27 18:50:47 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @EssexView @jongaunt @Kt_and_Nick Don't forget #lovinglife - we haven't heard that one for a little while 
968437011664261126 2018-02-27 10:45:50 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @LawandBeliefs @ShappiKhorsandi @andrewcopson Which fairy story do you draw the line at when people should no longer have their belief respected because it's stupid? Or do we just respect the fact that even if someone is wrong that their belief they are right makes it just as valid as people who are actually right.
968435960504639488 2018-02-27 10:41:40 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Gintonious @Donal_OKeeffe As long as the locals are inside when the doors are shut, I don't see a problem.
968435432215207937 2018-02-27 10:39:34 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @katelawler Hope you feel better soon.
968435365962010624 2018-02-27 10:39:18 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @katelawler Wait until your rear end wants a piece of the action, that's when the fun really starts.
968435022062645248 2018-02-27 10:37:56 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @FlippinKath @glitterkitty70 I expect to see you on the next series of Dragon's Den. I only want 10% of the company for the original idea.
968422998251319296 2018-02-27 09:50:09 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @FlippinKath @glitterkitty70 Quick register a patent before some bugger nicks this idea
968422805850198016 2018-02-27 09:49:23 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @FlippinKath @glitterkitty70 BOOM !!!!   Make them from duvet material, put a non stick sole on the bottom and I think you've got a product there. What a cracking name.
968422466317103104 2018-02-27 09:48:03 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @RufusHound Hi Rufus, you told me a joke about a moth on the radio a couple of months ago when we chatted about Norm MacDonald. Just thought I'd let you know that I will be seeing my first Noel Coward play in a few months because you're in it. Funny how life works.
968421072952610818 2018-02-27 09:42:30 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @FlippinKath @glitterkitty70 Excellent, I'm going to rename my socks "Foot duvets"
968420128315641856 2018-02-27 09:38:45 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @JulianStorey Remember the last time it snowed and Jon got all upset because the snow might make him fall over and hurt his bottom. Aw diddums, So who is the real snowflake Jon Gaunt ?pic.twitter.com/U0q77M9O8q
968398669128007682 2018-02-27 08:13:29 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @DVATW @jongaunt @darrenmc1975 @SuperJohny554 He's not had a paying gig for years, it does make me wonder how the hell he is paying for his lifestyle though, especially when you rack up almost 200K worth of debt within your company.
968398023716933632 2018-02-27 08:10:55 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> What a great idea this app is to report someone sleeping rough to homeless charities so that people can help them. @iainlee  I've just installed it on my phonehttps://twitter.com/LBC/status/968393022164602880
968396838469500928 2018-02-27 08:06:12 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @NickFerrariLBC @LBC @BrainPhrozen Really? how strange, because I keep hearing that LBC is full of leftie luvvies. like @mrjamesob. I guess that means they must be doing it right.
968380145206747136 2018-02-26 06:59:52 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @piersmorgan @jongaunt @EmmaCreamerITV @Kt_and_Nick I don't think even piers has these levels of self delusion, being on a holiday paid for by his listeners saying that freeloaders (and foreigners) should be executed https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=477_1494582719
968378321225572352 2018-02-26 06:52:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @SiobhanFTB @Todoboyo Nah, she made a snarky comment which is why I replied in the manner I did, then went on to say people verbally abused her because she is trans. I suspect that has everything to do with her appalling attitude rather than her gender.
968377916093497344 2018-02-26 06:51:01 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @gilescoren Did the Mexicans see your review of their restaurant?
968241503020703744 2018-02-26 21:48:58 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @OwenMacdonald8 @Todoboyo @SiobhanFTB No - I was right, you've confirmed that
968241418044133376 2018-02-26 21:48:37 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @OwenMacdonald8 @Todoboyo @SiobhanFTB What - this one where I say he should be wrestling men?pic.twitter.com/Xb3tfQiwt8
968240894150414336 2018-02-26 21:46:32 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @OwenMacdonald8 @Todoboyo @SiobhanFTB Perhaps if you tried reading what people write instead of being despertate to get offended you wouldn't make such a tit out of yourself.
968240532286853120 2018-02-26 21:45:06 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @OwenMacdonald8 @Todoboyo @SiobhanFTB No, you've just got such a big chip on your shoulder that you can't see I actually agree with you.
968239286830104576 2018-02-26 21:40:09 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @OwenMacdonald8 @Todoboyo @SiobhanFTB They would be banned if it was a woman taking these steroids in a woman's sport. That's what I'm saying, he isn't taking part in mens sport so your point is irrelevant
968202611722719234 2018-02-26 19:14:25 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @tracyry43946583 @spindwyer59 I know, which is why Jon's been imprisoned in obscurity for soooooo long.
968202456042745857 2018-02-26 19:13:48 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @OwenMacdonald8 @Todoboyo Ironically, he'd probably be banned for the substances he is taking if this were the Olympics, it must give him a massive edge.
968152919123156993 2018-02-26 15:56:57 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @DVATW Well your mate @jongaunt helped them on their way to getting more power by voting for them when there was a UKIP candidate he could have voted for. Seems free tution was more important than priniples or country. Not someone you can trust.
968151711377448960 2018-02-26 15:52:10 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @screamingspuds He voted for Corbyn and admitted it's because he wanted you to pay for his kids uni fees and thought Corbyn would deliver. He had a UKIP candidate in his ward if he wanted to protest vote to stick it to May.
968151251258048512 2018-02-26 15:50:20 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @tracyry43946583 @spindwyer59 So does the person who spent years brown nosing UKIP telling you to vote for them, and then voted for Corbyn because he wanted you to pay for his kids uni fees.
968150282776535040 2018-02-26 15:46:29 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @darrenmc1975 @SuperJohny554 I guess the speed will depend on whether he's going to shirk his responsibilities and pay back his half of the losses or not. We must all ring in and ask when he finally starts up again with  @DVATW or some othe no mark.
968100730325356544 2018-02-26 12:29:35 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @darrenmc1975 Big news coming soon #lovinglife etc.
968100551924879360 2018-02-26 12:28:52 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @darrenmc1975 Soon, very soon, watch this space etc.
968098676659847169 2018-02-26 12:21:25 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jonhorsley1 Yes, the house seems empty, for some reason you know he's not around.
968042708009922560 2018-02-26 08:39:01 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jonhorsley1 We got our first dog I didn't want him, 6 moths later I was positive I didn't want him after he's shat and pissed over everything and chewed my furniture. 3 years on it seems strange when he's not here.
968042172921581568 2018-02-26 08:36:54 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @OwenMacdonald8 He's saying "you go girl" you realise that the he was wrestiling in the girls competition right?  He should be wresteling in the male competition.
968039790275948544 2018-02-26 08:27:25 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> Fucking LOLhttps://twitter.com/JoeScaramanga/status/968035502497718272
968039359336407040 2018-02-26 08:25:43 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @SkyNews The horror - I don't know if we'll make it through thispic.twitter.com/ZjdKR5d2SI
968037738762129408 2018-02-26 08:19:16 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @NickFerrariLBC @LBC @nikeehirst The rich already pay more tax than you do.
968037608092766208 2018-02-26 08:18:45 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @NickFerrariLBC @LBC As everyone is going to get old, then it should apply to everyone, not just the over 40's - stupid idea.
968037370346995713 2018-02-26 08:17:49 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @NickFerrariLBC @LBC @SonOfBrown17 Yes lets get the rich to pay a fair amoutn of tax - how about a flat rate of 33% for everyone, that's fair. Or shall we just leave it with them paying 15% more than everyone else like they do at present?
968029800873984000 2018-02-25 07:47:44 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> I see there was an explosion in Leicester last night, has anyone alerted inspectors @TRobinsonNewEra and @jongaunt of the yard so that they can investigate and tell us that it was probably Muslims like they usually do.
967863141458735104 2018-02-25 20:45:29 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @NetworksManager @MarkH1412 @mickeynu477 @EnglishTommy2 @TRobinsonNewEra @jongaunt @nicosegal @Crazyparklady1 Yep, We all miss Jon's daily hate - straight out of 1984. Along with changing the history of what has really happened.
967862629699121152 2018-02-25 20:43:27 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jonadams1970 Ah, I know what you mean. I'm loving life big things coming for me very very soon, which is better than really soon.
967862237124812801 2018-02-25 20:41:53 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Steven_Woolfe @uk_rants Perhaps @jongaunt should have put Britain first instead of his pocket when he voted for Corbyn in the general election, because he promised that he's make taxpayers cogh up to pay for his kids degree.
967825521420783618 2018-02-25 18:16:00 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @AlanKelloggs Fuck 'em
967825215223984129 2018-02-25 18:14:47 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jonadams1970 Sorry to hear that Jon - what happened?
967811526127181824 2018-02-25 17:20:23 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @BootstrapCook You are doing it the vegan way. No sausage.
967743417391439873 2018-02-25 12:49:45 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @NobodySaidThis Ah, you've seen through him. He actually voted for Corbyn in the last election. Has been a member of CND in the past, campaigned with the Greenham common women, and stood on the picket line with the miners against Thatcher.

967533159335235586 2018-02-24 22:54:15 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Independent I'd rather not know - what good can come of it? the only thing it will do is make you feel pissed off or miserable.
967532891482853376 2018-02-24 22:53:11 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @phant_tom I think you're obsessed, he's probably not going to bum you, you know, no matter how vigorously you rim him on a daily basis.
967532516973432833 2018-02-24 22:51:42 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @WBA @jongaunt @phant_tom Hahahaha.  Yeah, I'll be so ashamed when he teams up with Baldy Vance.
967438995901775877 2018-02-24 16:40:05 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @andyvblue Quick, someone hit it with a rolled up newspaper before it lays eggs
967438145699631104 2018-02-24 16:36:42 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @JuliaHB1 Bedford's not going to know what hit it.
967437864635166720 2018-02-24 16:35:35 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @RufusHound @FlippinKath @whitey_carl Actually mate - could you not use the phrase "Nanny State" it leaves out granddads. If you could change it to grandparent state, we'd all be a lot happier. Thanks
967437448425943041 2018-02-24 16:33:56 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @RufusHound @FlippinKath @whitey_carl Can you point me in the direction of something else one can be offended by, there's not enough of it these days. Cheers.
967436876746457093 2018-02-24 16:31:40 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @daraobriain That's not what Fozzie told me
967436757271707648 2018-02-24 16:31:11 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @sarapascoe Post it on "faces in things" there's loads of good ones on there.
967436525876236290 2018-02-24 16:30:16 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @sarapascoe @RubyCarmine No it really isn't.  I feel the same
967413557343158273 2018-02-24 14:59:00 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @WBA @jongaunt @Skuzzlebutt17 @gordy650 He was sacked by Talksport 8 years ago, since then he's slagged off everyone in the radio industry, the mere fact he hasn't had a job on national radio in those 8 years tells you all you need to know.
967412772353998848 2018-02-24 14:55:53 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @WBA @jongaunt @richbeee @sckelfey Jon and his fans are obsessed with men's penises

967411208184893441 2018-02-24 14:49:40 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @WBA @jongaunt @NeilHow49337747 @andy_summers20 Yes I heard that, absolutely despicable., I would love to know whether he is going to pay his fair share of the losses he's racked up with J&L Broadcasting - but I suspect I already know the answer.
967390166213111808 2018-02-24 13:26:03 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @WBA @jongaunt @danedweller What did he say on his show that can't be said anywhere else?
967389787299700737 2018-02-24 13:24:33 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @WBA @jongaunt @NeilHow49337747 He hasn't left that company, it was his company - ask him why he's really stopped - he won't tell you
967389540120956928 2018-02-24 13:23:34 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @WBA @jongaunt @phant_tom Gaunts 3 opportunities   1) Cleaning the bogs 2) Doing the hovering in the studio 3) Emptying the bins  Doesn't matter which one you choose Jon, it's still pay more than you've earned in the last 6 years.
966946835796434944 2018-02-23 08:04:25 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @THR It doesn't matter how violent the video game is, if I cannot get hold of a gun, then I can't possibly copy it. It isn't fucking rocket science Donald.
966930748216348673 2018-02-22 07:00:29 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @ewenmacintosh I stayed in a Ramada that disabled the HDMI sockets on their TVs so I couldn't plug in my laptop to watch films with the kids - they got a big "Fuck off" from me.
966930341687709696 2018-02-22 06:58:52 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @ewenmacintosh The same bloke who wont answer any questions as to why he is no longer a part of his own limited company which produced a radio station where he was the only presenter. Cluck cluck @jongaunt
966929729881366528 2018-02-22 06:56:26 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Telegraph Good, they always used to be made of paper anyway when I was a kid
966929390776082437 2018-02-22 06:55:06 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Telegraph @SuperbikeAl @British_Future A very good point, you're absolutely right.
966756299731070976 2018-02-22 19:27:17 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @SkyNews Fair play to him, at least it's a start.
966755993681039360 2018-02-22 19:26:05 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @NRA @waynelapierrejr Do you really love your guns more than you love your children?  That NRA spokeaman is a weapons grade fuckronaut. @realDonaldTrump #FloridaShooting
966755548418002944 2018-02-22 19:24:18 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @NRA @Channel4News What a weapons grade fuckwit
966711251287117824 2018-02-22 16:28:17 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @LBC @DLloyd150 @TheMelv78 @SimpleSimonUK Well as the conversation is about arming teachers and you said that you would only employ registered gun owning people, then the teachers that don't currently own guns would be sacked.  Like I said, you haven't thought this through.
966665450930262016 2018-02-22 13:26:17 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> So Don thinks that the answer to school shootings is to introduce more guns into schools. It's a bit like having a user who has overdosed and saying "What this guy needs is more heroin" #cockwmomble #FloridaShooting @realDonaldTrump
966664582013087744 2018-02-22 13:22:50 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @LBC @DLloyd150 @TheMelv78 @SimpleSimonUK So you're going to sack all the teachers in the USA and replace them with gun owners.  I don't think you've thought this through
966663937101123584 2018-02-22 13:20:17 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @LBC @TheMelv78 @SimpleSimonUK Except for when we did it here and it did work - and in Australia. We don't have mass shootings. It's not rocket science.
966488791576956930 2018-02-21 01:44:19 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @katiefolger You can have mine - I've broken him.
966488662681833473 2018-02-21 01:43:48 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @katiefolger Yep, we had a school shooting in 1996, and the government said "That's it - no more guns" - guess how many we've had since.  It's not rocket science
966488084324978688 2018-02-21 01:41:30 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @katiefolger Fantastic. I'm glad to hear you're enjoying it so much. If you love what you're doing there is nothing better or more fulfilling in life. I got to do something I loved last week - spent some time in your great country, I had a blast.
966468197376516096 2018-02-21 00:22:29 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @steve__1979 I'm reasonably sure that Liverpool council is mostly labour - twonk.
966376533081362432 2018-02-21 18:18:14 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @LBC Until they can prove that religion has any basis in fact, than fantastical ideas about how animals should be killed should be treated as nonsense. Kill them as humanely as possible, if people don't like it, they can become vegitarians.
966364193497731081 2018-02-21 17:29:12 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @Bricrabtree You'll be blocked for that. Funny Jon calls Corbyn a chicken, yet he still won't disclose why he is no longer a part of the company where he was the only presenter.
966363711685431296 2018-02-21 17:27:17 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @RT_com @RTUKnews @jongaunt @MikeDraper16 You'll get more listeners than he ever did.
966296160918036480 2018-02-21 12:58:52 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @BBCNews How can it be "banned" - they haven't even attempted to show that advert since 24th December. Santa should have brought someone at the BBC a new dictionary.
966295465649164288 2018-02-21 12:56:06 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @AlanKelloggs Luckily there are hamburger stands up there.
966295254684131328 2018-02-21 12:55:16 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @JuliaHB1 If my wife said that to me I'd reply "I'll pay"
966295086400180225 2018-02-21 12:54:36 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @Sergeant8Robert @andy_summers20 @Apeat1A Ah, anyone who sees through Gaunt is a troll are they. Ask Andy Summers about the DM he got when he was a fan who actually sent money to the bloke.
966294648334508032 2018-02-21 12:52:51 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @andy_summers20 @Apeat1A @Sergeant8Robert Absolutely, his past links to the IRA would put off anyone who calls themselves a "patriot" for voting for him.
966293778649710594 2018-02-21 12:49:24 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @Sergeant8Robert @andy_summers20 @Apeat1A with their 12 grand. Soine is going to have to pay that money with their insurance going up. Why should I expect a bin mna to chip in with a 45 grand debt because my kid want's to read "classics" FFS - what use is that to the taxpayer?
966293494401781761 2018-02-21 12:48:16 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @Sergeant8Robert @andy_summers20 @Apeat1A No I fucking wouldn't - how dare you. I believe in paying my way, not poncing off others to fund my lifestyle choices. I keep getting ambulance chasers telling me I'm entitled to money for being in an accident. I wasn't hurt, my car got fixed so I tell them to fuck off (1/2)
966293019799498753 2018-02-21 12:46:23 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @Sergeant8Robert @andy_summers20 @Apeat1A I am willing to bet that you get a DM from Gaunt telling you that you are not allowed to converse with "trolls" - think about that when it happens. Why would someone who believes in free speech try and control who you talk to.
966292726533804032 2018-02-21 12:45:13 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @Sergeant8Robert @andy_summers20 @Apeat1A Except if everyone votes for them.  I would never vote labour because I have principles, it doesn't matter how she loses her majority - she has, has it made her any better - NO.  There was no need to vote labour unless you wanted the freebie. He did, he said so.
966292075288375298 2018-02-21 12:42:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @LBC I think people should fuck off and realise that Vikings had them long before Jamaicans.

966291653966385152 2018-02-21 12:40:57 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @Sergeant8Robert @andy_summers20 @Apeat1A The more people who vote labour - the more chance they have of actually winning. If everyone did what jon thought was a great idea they'd have won by a landslide. You can put equal pressure on her by making her lose her majority - voting UKIP would do that.
966224714183139328 2018-02-21 08:14:58 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jeremycorbyn @JuliaHB1 @talkRADIO I find it hard to disagree with him.

966179083238412299 2018-02-20 05:13:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @MSBJAGUAR And your mate Gaunt helped in his bid to get to number 10 by voting for him in the last election - FFS wake up man.
966178545067352067 2018-02-20 05:11:30 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @Sergeant8Robert @andy_summers20 @Apeat1A There was a UKIP candidate in that constituency, so Gaunt could have voted for him if he wanted to make a "protest vote" - he admitted that he wanted the free tuition. He wants you to pay for his kids degree in her hobby.

965986151843721216 2018-02-20 16:27:00 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @CollymoreStan @phant_tom @stgeorgehughes So why have you got a picture of George Galloway without his hat?

965973500677820418 2018-02-20 15:36:44 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @realDonaldTrump  Dear Americans, we had a school shooting in 1996 afterward the government said "Right - no more guns!"  - guess how many school shootings we've had since?  http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/13/newsid_2543000/2543277.stm
965971482718408704 2018-02-20 15:28:43 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @stgeorgehughes Will it be as big as the colossal debt he ran up with talk2me radio? and the burning question...is he going to do the right thing and pay it off?

Funnily enough though, the AR 15 I was shooting last week took axactly the same 9mm rounds as the glock 17 I was also shooting.  Fun in the range, but idiots shouldn't be allowed one.

965652518331088896 2018-02-19 18:21:15 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @Shout2YouRadio @shappers_uk What were you once allowed to say, that you are missing saying because it's now become a racial slur.  I haven't used the word "chinky" for a good 20 years or so now. I can't say I've particularly missed it, I get by just fine using the word "Chinese"
965652122657320960 2018-02-19 18:19:41 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @Shout2YouRadio @shappers_uk I can't see it's very much lower than it has been since the last 20 or so years.

Failure to take up the challenge will be taken as an admission that you're talking shit. #putuporshutup

I suspect you won't though, because you actually like being spoon fed  lies by a bloke that reflects your views - I don't think whether he actually is telling you the truth matters to you

He had no Ofcom to "tie him down" but it was still a massive failure. No excuses this time it was all down to him. Resigned from his own company - pfft

They are mostly hunting rifles that Canadians own

In the film a rabbit is allergic to Blackberries and other animals throw them at him. This is insensitive to allergy sufferers. Sadly it made more of a spash than the school shooting

Do me a favour.
963880081230909440 2018-02-14 20:58:14 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg Have a look at the tweets to you on feb 8th all the financial details were sent to you, except for this one page. They have fucked up and someohow put in the wrong person. What a coincidencepic.twitter.com/a7vniC6VI1

963790721940680704 2018-02-14 15:03:09 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @talk2meradiouk @jongaunt @tomwilliams1990 That's exactly how it was. He's "resigned" from his own company that he was telling everyone was going to be really successful when he was taking peoples money off them.
963790231022592002 2018-02-14 15:01:12 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @talk2meradiouk @jongaunt @tracyry43946583 Telling the truth about what? he "resigned" a month ago. Ask him why he "resigned" from his own company set up in his own name. Why did he continue to take peoples money if this was a planned thing?  Tell your fans the truth about why you "resigned" Jon.

963770492363722754 2018-02-14 13:42:46 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @CawthorneJimmy Yeah - the problem is, that Jon hates freedom of speech. Any dissenting voices from his fans result in a block, then legal threats and finally threats of violence. He's a fraud mate.
963769344009351169 2018-02-14 13:38:12 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @FlippinKath They could use http://www.atube.me/ to record what is coming out of the laptop as a file, but it would be recording the show rather than downloading it, so it would take 3 hours.
963635128030425089 2018-02-13 04:44:52 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @CawthorneJimmy So don't use my freedom of speech. Is that what you're saying?

This was despicable manipulation of the truth. He won't come on here and defend it though.
963633886025613312 2018-02-13 04:39:56 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @LBC @Nigel_Farage @KTHopkins @mrjamesob @RaheemKassam @grimois Exactly - but that doesn't suit the narrative he is trying to push. This is just out and out lying and propaganda. I'm a conservative - but I will not stand by and let liars hijack my views, they need to be exposed.
963632612404355072 2018-02-13 04:34:52 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @LBC @Nigel_Farage @KTHopkins @mrjamesob @RaheemKassam And immediately after that his next sentence is "I'm a little bit uncomfortable with what you're saying". Absolute twat - I thought you were supposed to be against "Fake news" you're just as bad as the MSM - working to your own agenda and twisting facts to suit it.

963626551454654464 2018-02-13 04:10:47 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @CawthorneJimmy I couldn't agree more, Jon I hope you keep the same level of luck as you've had for the last few years, never change it.
963625541139132417 2018-02-13 04:06:46 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @chuffertrain5 Virtually all of Jon's "trolls", are people who love free speech and believed his hype, only to find out that you must not have the temerity to even question him, lest you be blocked or even threatened with legal action or violence. No one likes being conned

They shouldn't be blocked by them when they ask the question as some have been.

961243289864298496 2018-02-07 14:20:33 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @talkRADIO It shouldn't be necessary to know, he's proven yet again that he is an absolute danger to children and should be locked up for the rest of his natural life. He is sick and shouldn't be allowed to mix with society, he doesn't belong. with normal people.

961191125770997760 2018-02-07 10:53:17 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @talk2meradiouk @jongaunt @Proud2bEnglish1 That would imply he was sacked. Jon says he wasn't and that he resigned. Therefore Jon shut himself down. It had nothing to do with lefties. (the last submitted accounts showed a staggering loss BTW - which is a far more likely contributor)

961155951519784960 2018-02-07 08:33:30 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @BBCr4today @RodInAthens The way I learned it happened gradually as people ventured further north. Those without a vitamin D deficiency would have lived longer and been more able to reproduce, thus passing on the pigmentation gene.
961154381684133889 2018-02-07 08:27:16 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @talkRADIO LOL - can you ask them if they've seen my horse - oh, and while they're at it, can they come round and bolt my stable door please.
961151821329981440 2018-02-07 08:17:06 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @BBCr4today Very interesting but i'm a little suspicious, only because light skin is far more efficient at producing vitamin D from the limited sunlight we get this far north. And darker sking is more efficient at protecting the skin from strong sunlight.

960792535437402113 2018-02-06 08:29:25 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @bigamisty I hope his fans will see this for what it is, You can't come on twitter and goad people into "trolling you" then start crying like a big girls blouse if they actually take you up on your invitation, to try and get sympathy.
960792188497154049 2018-02-06 08:28:03 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @bigamisty This post by Jon attempting to goad people into "trolling" him, speaks volumes. I think he actually likes being "trolled" it makes him feel in some way relevant as if he thinks "If I'm being trolled I must be doing something right."
960791568109199360 2018-02-06 08:25:35 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @bigamisty He's threatened me many times over the years, but I like many people have done the decent thing over the last few days and not piled in with the mauling he's getting from some accounts because I find it all a bit unsavoury, it's gone too far.

960785760470339584 2018-02-06 08:02:30 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg 5) they do not see how owning a cat that they introduce into the local environment to kill and maim birds and small animals, just so they have something to cuddle is in any way hypocritical. I was told categorically that vegans do not allow their cats to attack other animals.
960785289143902208 2018-02-06 08:00:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg I've been having a fun old time with them. Things I've learned.  1) They can't read and digest information  2) They use gifs of "Ron Swanson" to make a point without knowing who he is  3) They think animals are people  4) they think Lions and Tigers are cruel for killing animals
960783205807869952 2018-02-05 07:52:21 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @megsawad @Rycet66 @mosigsoodle It would be like me using a gif of Jimmy Saville if I was talking about child abuse.
960696437670588416 2018-02-05 02:07:34 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> I pointed out to a vegan that contrary to what they asserted, chimps eat meat and actually hunt monkeys. They said that I was trying to use the cruelty of chimps to my benefit. I post the following as evidence of the stupidest person on twitter.pic.twitter.com/dtUE53lO9W
960695711217192961 2018-02-05 02:04:41 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @CTWarrior @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds You're are literally too stupid to argue with - muted.
960695449031204865 2018-02-05 02:03:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @CTWarrior @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds Walking on 2 legs - not much foraging in the savannah - good for hunting though. Oh forward facing eyes like all hunters, canines for tearing meat. The fact we are human and not apes comes from eating meat, because our brains evolved. You should try it sometime.
960693695237509121 2018-02-05 01:56:40 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds I've shown you the definition of "someone" it only applies to people - you are calling animals people by referring to them as "someone", they are not. They are animals.
960693244475699200 2018-02-05 01:54:52 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @CarresKat I understands that people who own cats are not animal lovers, they introduce predators into the local environment and don't give a shit how many birds and small animals they kill, just so they can have something to cuddle, any vegan with a cat is a fraud.
960692761828777986 2018-02-05 01:52:57 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @Donovan240880 @CarresKat @Bewyds I don't care about everyone else. I am the most important being in my life apart from my children.

960692074134802432 2018-02-05 01:50:13 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @CTWarrior @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds Sorry to burst your bubble mate, but chimps hunt monkeyshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpYViR9MqrU
960690550172241920 2018-02-05 01:44:10 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @mosigsoodle @Rycet66 Yeah, 2 of them have quoted articles that both say that eating meat helped our brains evolve, but it's not what they're looking for so they don't see it.
960690216095899648 2018-02-05 01:42:50 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds My car isn't a person - neither are animals
960676996488540160 2018-02-05 00:50:19 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @mosigsoodle @Rycet66 Mate, it's nuts - I've got another one saying that the rise in people wanting heartburn tablets is to do with eating meat.  Nothing to do with coke or fried foods though - no it's down to a piece of lean chicken. These people are loonies.
960676608737710080 2018-02-05 00:48:46 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @Donovan240880 @CarresKat @Bewyds No - like eating meat and I am more important than any animal.
960676431167664128 2018-02-05 00:48:04 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @CTWarrior @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds Coke will give you heartburn, so will peppers and the processed shit like crisps and fried foods, all are far more likely to give you heartburn than a piece of chicken. You're talking absolute tommyrot now.
960675972902195200 2018-02-05 00:46:15 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @CTWarrior @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds We have canines, funnily enough the closest animal to us and the most intelligent animal other than us are chimps - guess what they have canines too and they eat meat.
960675336068493314 2018-02-05 00:43:43 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @mosigsoodle @Rycet66 They really are quite bizarre, I only started talking to them because one of them was claiming that vegans are a minority that is being discriminated against, and theyshould have the same protection as Black/Disabled/Gay people etc.
960674861474635777 2018-02-05 00:41:50 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds That's anthropomorphism and it isn't healthy. They are animals, we are human therefore the term "someone" cannot possibly apply. You might as well say my car is "someone"
960674432128831488 2018-02-05 00:40:07 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @mosigsoodle @Rycet66 Have you seen her latest one about cats? "No vegan would allow their cat to maim birds or wild animals"  Cuckoo cuckoo
960674060937170944 2018-02-05 00:38:39 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @mosigsoodle Hahahaha - that's hilarious, what do they do, walk them on a lead?
960673959275585546 2018-02-05 00:38:15 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> Just in case you didn't think vegans spoke enough bollocks.https://twitter.com/mosigsoodle/status/960672926767890432
960673820980973568 2018-02-05 00:37:42 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @megsawad @mosigsoodle @Rycet66 Oh dear, she should stop digging.
960673666638938112 2018-02-05 00:37:05 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @Donovan240880 @CarresKat @Bewyds Me too, that's why I only eat outdoor reared animals that I get from my butcher. If they've lived a good life, they are much, much tastier. Wild boar for example is like pork to the power of 10, it is so good.
960673242934542336 2018-02-05 00:35:24 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @CTWarrior @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds Except for the fact that we actually did evolve to eat meat, you're absolutely right.
960672955566051329 2018-02-05 00:34:15 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @megsawad @mosigsoodle @Rycet66 Clearly, she couldn't have used a worse gif if she tried, that was a spectacular own goal.
960672402358366208 2018-02-05 00:32:03 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @mosigsoodle It's funny because you don't know "Ron Swanson's" views - here's a gif for you - lolpic.twitter.com/qzKatR4OfG
960671350728937472 2018-02-05 00:27:53 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @megsawad @Rycet66 @mosigsoodle Yeah, but you've used a GIF of "Ron Swanson" that is fucking hilarious especially as you're a vegan.
960671139793076224 2018-02-05 00:27:02 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @mosigsoodle Because they are introducing a predator into the eco system which will kill and maim animals, purely because they want something to cuddle. That is rank hypocrisy or do mice and wild birds not count. Why should mice and birds die for your entertainment?
960670619414286336 2018-02-05 00:24:58 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds Which part of "Animals are not people" are you having difficulty with?pic.twitter.com/2w9eszT90T
960670216496795648 2018-02-05 00:23:22 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @Donovan240880 @CarresKat @Bewyds So you'd like to wipe out all these animals then.
960670068937056256 2018-02-05 00:22:47 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @CTWarrior @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds And so I should, I'm a human being.  Your other point is absurd, if you were evolved to breathe using your lungs there wouldn't be a possibility of you getting lung cancer.  It's as nonsensical as the "point" you were trying to make.
960668428523786240 2018-02-05 00:16:16 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds Animals aren't "someone" that only applies to people. You're anthropomorphising
960668206393372672 2018-02-05 00:15:23 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @mosigsoodle Yeah, it was based on the abstract I read earlier. ANd I've also pointed out where they say IN THE PAPER YOU USED that eating meat  kickstarted the evolution of our brains. You clearly didn't read it or you wouldn't have used it.
960667649842741248 2018-02-05 00:13:10 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> LOL - when a vegan uses "Ron Swanson" to be snarky without realising who "Ron Swanson" is.https://twitter.com/mosigsoodle/status/958208702347030528
960667500760518657 2018-02-05 00:12:35 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @megsawad @Rycet66 @mosigsoodle You know that's "Ron Swanson" right?
960666954930511873 2018-02-05 00:10:25 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @mosigsoodle Because it is, I don't think vegans should won cats, I think if they do they are hypocrites. Do you know any vegans who own a cat?

960625803137617920 2018-02-05 21:26:53 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @CarresKat @Bewyds @johnnychick They are.
960625514514874381 2018-02-05 21:25:44 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @mosigsoodle I don't think you read it Kylie, or you would have noticed this "Eating meat may have kick-started the evolution of bigger brains,"  Cooking came about around 1/2 million years after we started eating meat.
960624928281235461 2018-02-05 21:23:25 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @mosigsoodle I read an article about it earlier today
960624731304194050 2018-02-05 21:22:38 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @mosigsoodle Kylie - do you know any vegans who have a cat?
960624506481139712 2018-02-05 21:21:44 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @CTWarrior @Iromg @Bewyds @johnnychick @CarresKat It's not for selfish pleasure, it's because I have evolved to eat meat. Meat is tasty it's pretty well the tastiest stuff on the planet. By the way, they aren't mothers and babies, they're sheep, they don't even know what day it is. Stop anthropomorphising them
960623327063740422 2018-02-05 21:17:03 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @mosigsoodle Yeah, as well as meat. I've already been through this with another oddball.
960623136164208641 2018-02-05 21:16:17 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds Do you know any vegans that own a cat?
960623055000276993 2018-02-05 21:15:58 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @johnnychick @CarresKat @Bewyds Where did I say I wanted them to suffer. A quick bolt through the head and it's over and done with. There's lots of things we don't require in life - like electricity - but that doesn't mean I want to go without them
960585093701160960 2018-02-05 18:45:07 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @Bewyds @johnnychick @CarresKat What's wrong with eating dogs? if it's got 4 legs you can eat it (except for Polar Bears)  There way those dogs are locked in that cage is abhorrent, but it wouldn't be allowed over here.
960538062160842752 2018-02-05 15:38:14 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @VoxVegan @HumbleVeganDad Because our cows have much more meat on them - it's not rocket science.
960537900608884736 2018-02-05 15:37:36 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @VoxVegan @HumbleVeganDad No, I was going to ask if any of them had cats.
960520269419905024 2018-02-05 14:27:32 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @VoxVegan @HumbleVeganDad We don't live in India. and our cows are much nicer than those scrawny looking manky things. Do vegans have pets BTW?
960519783455379456 2018-02-05 14:25:36 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @VoxVegan Why should I give a shit if a Lemur gets done in because I want some beef? Lemurs are wannabe monkeys and they probably don't taste good, so there's no need for them

960505899440799746 2018-02-05 13:30:26 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg If it weren't for us meat eaters a lot of animals would have gone extinct, when was the last time you saw a wild pig or a wild chicken. We are conservationists. If Pandas were tasty they wouldn't be endangered.
960504198440865793 2018-02-05 13:23:40 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iromg @mosigsoodle @VoxVegan Yeah, the key here is the word ALSO - it means in addition to. Cooking absolutely helped, but we didn't start cooking until about 1/2 million years after we started eating meat.

960122815960829952 2018-02-04 12:08:12 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @ellco1867 @allanimalrights BTW - being vegan does not make you a minority, anti discrimination laws are in place because people cannot help being black or gay or disabled. Veganism is an ideology, so you rightly don't have the same rights. All ideologies are open to scrutiny.

960121193582989312 2018-02-04 12:01:45 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @ellco1867 @allanimalrights Ah, so I should ignore the views of a respected scientist and believe some numpty on the internet.   I'll stick with actual science like thishttps://allyouneedisbiology.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/meat-evolution-humans/
960119247816060928 2018-02-04 11:54:01 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> The best picture you'll see on twitter todayhttps://twitter.com/ExcelPope/status/959710285438291969
960119116114923520 2018-02-04 11:53:30 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @con_gaunt There's quite a lot of homoerotic undertones in his posts.
960116818169008128 2018-02-04 11:44:22 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @peteprodge @con_gaunt It is quite a bizarre move to make.
960116631434420224 2018-02-04 11:43:37 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @peteprodge @con_gaunt Ah, a threat of violence toward me. Silly old sausage.@jongaunt

960115426427658240 2018-02-04 11:38:50 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @ellco1867 @allanimalrights Don't talk nonsense, of course our bodies digest meat, you might as well say you can't eat corn because I've seen that in my poo. We wouldn't have evolved the brains we have were it not for our meat diet. It's what separated us from the apes and made us human
960114966027259904 2018-02-04 11:37:00 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @peteprodge @con_gaunt I'm not going to report it, because  1) It's not me  2) the silly old scrote has enough on his plate at the moment.
960109428212228096 2018-02-04 11:15:00 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @ellco1867 @allanimalrights As an aside, if we weren't supposed to eat meat, why do we have canines and why are animals so tasty?
960109095440265217 2018-02-04 11:13:40 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @ellco1867 @allanimalrights That's only because he was trying to get to the front of the queue of the KFC before anyone else - he heard they had a deal on bargain buckets.
960108700232019969 2018-02-04 11:12:06 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @peteprodge @con_gaunt Is it? I had no idea. He's a very strange man, he get an idea in his head (god knows where from) and cannot be disabused of it. I think that's wehre he went wrong, he got the idea that he was a great broadcaster that didn't need tips on broadcasting.

960107552255152128 2018-02-04 11:07:33 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @iainlee @con_gaunt Why is Jon so fixated on men masturbating over images of him?
960107036477444096 2018-02-04 11:05:30 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @con_gaunt Oh look, a threat to Ollie - "I know where you work"
960106512009105409 2018-02-04 11:03:25 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @allanimalrights I've tried, but I can't catch him
960105040873705474 2018-02-04 10:57:34 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Bellanger_N1 @gilescoren I remember when all straws used to be paper.
960104630586892288 2018-02-04 10:55:56 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @MaajidNawaz Hooray - yet another group of people who are perpetually offended, I was beginning to think we didn't have enough.
960104116923092992 2018-02-04 10:53:54 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @allanimalrights It's an absurd assertion to make, Vegans wouldn't have the energy to become terrorists.

960096932097134592 2018-02-04 10:25:21 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @peteprodge @jongaunt He can't, the problem is that Pete wasn't tweeting anything about him, he just assumed he was and that nay other "troll" accounts were actually Pete. He then posted this video naming him and threatening violence against him. It's open and shut. https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=1c7_1494751519
959921363594240001 2018-02-03 22:47:42 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @masiFoto @katiefolger I'm making this my year of adventure and self discovery. I'm not listening to the news, It can all bugger off. At some point I plan on packing a backpack and sodding off into a desert somewhere
959920720427061253 2018-02-03 22:45:08 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @katiefolger HA! wait until you get to an age when that's a compliment.
959919980203659264 2018-02-03 22:42:12 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @katiefolger Hi Katie, it's Hippy Churchill here, had to change my ID. How are the Dynamite sister doing? hope it's all going well
959918892746465281 2018-02-03 22:37:53 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @Iamjessecboyd WHOA !!! I had no idea you were in it.
959914412105719808 2018-02-03 22:20:04 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @peteprodge @74oscars Let me know how you get on, what are you investigating him for? I've heard several rumours about him, manly about his roles in toppling Saddam and Ghadaffi.
959911368911675392 2018-02-03 22:07:59 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @peteprodge @jongaunt @big_mikky His main allegation is that Jon threatened him with violence - here is a video of Jon doing it. It's pretty open and shut. I don't know what Jon is playing at here. https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=1c7_1494751519
959910611944660992 2018-02-03 22:04:58 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @jongaunt @tracyry43946583 There is no ambiguity here - a threat of violence was made against Peteprodge. It's on video.  https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=1c7_1494751519 so where is the lie?

959902722953830407 2018-02-03 21:33:37 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @balconyshirts Always choose the same dish as a benchmark. If I try a new curry house I always order a Chicken Bhuna - then I can judge it against previous ones and tell if it's any good.

959840007606415360 2018-02-03 17:24:25 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @iainlee @blairsmoonlight @markrendle @KaraVanPark I guess you're feeling a bit stupid about picking up someone on their misuse of words now.
959839709831815177 2018-02-03 17:23:14 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @iainlee @Cybrarian64 He did a TV series about it as well, so it's probably available on the internet somewhere. That's what led me to the book.

959835896232235009 2018-02-03 17:08:05 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @iainlee @blairsmoonlight @KaraVanPark Well, like you, most of that song was incorrect as well.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfpB0kDLEts
959835612995047426 2018-02-03 17:06:57 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @iainlee @Cybrarian64 I love etymology. Have you read "Mother Tongue" by Bill Bryson?, it's glorious.  I read "The adventure of English" by Melvyn Bragg and whilst interesting, was very heavy going in parts. Bryson's book is much better in my opinion.

959831840176726017 2018-02-03 16:51:58 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @alexisconran @talkRADIO No, there are plenty of abandoned properties in this country that could be done up by local councils and used to rent out to people, they'd even make a small profit out of it, so it's good for all of us.
959830870793351168 2018-02-03 16:48:07 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @iainlee @Cybrarian64 My parents are Scottish and we have a big family but I can honestly say that's the first time I've seen (or heard) it used outside of address to a haggis. I'm all for using some ancient words, some of them are great.
959829952190386177 2018-02-03 16:44:28 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @FlippinKath @TheDavidBabcock I'll bet it was dear to fix it.
959829310617063425 2018-02-03 16:41:55 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @iainlee @Cybrarian64 If he's got a sonsie face, wouldn't that make him the "Great chieftain O' the puddin' race" ?   You're the only person other than Burns, I've seen use that. 
959828332820029440 2018-02-03 16:38:01 UTC <CTWarriorMonkey> @iainlee You're welcome.  If anyone else has any similar photo's send 'em my way, it must satify some sort of OCD thing I have, if I see a photo like that I can't help but try and clean it up. I'm the same with silverware - just wish I had some.
