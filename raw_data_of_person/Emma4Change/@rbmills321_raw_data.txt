968207565749448704 2018-02-26 19:34:06 UTC <rbmills321> And now we are putting the flag at half-staff to honor a huckster/con artist. All so the cheeto retard can suck up to the evangelical taliban.
967140780686172161 2018-02-23 20:55:05 UTC <rbmills321> I HATE NBC sometimes. I turn on to watch Ellen, as I do everyday, and it is interrupted by "breaking" coverage of the pig faced, orange motherfucker. I don't care what the shithead umpa-loompa has to say. I have never cared.

962047974888038400 2018-02-09 19:38:05 UTC <rbmills321> @EdwardTHardy They needed a non white "friend" to show off.
961203294407417856 2018-02-07 11:41:38 UTC <rbmills321> @TitusNation Why do you think there is still religion? The biggest con of all!
960216165573373952 2018-02-04 18:19:08 UTC <rbmills321> @rickygervais Stupid is as stupid does. I have been asked what I thought of religion before and in less than 5 minutes, most go... 
959886499000053761 2018-02-03 20:29:09 UTC <rbmills321> @rickygervais Faith = the absence of critical thinking Faith = the rejection of common sense Faith = the inability to accept facts that do not support one's preconceived and/or unprovable opinions
959794364208812032 2018-02-03 14:23:03 UTC <rbmills321> @FWGMills It's a gimmick, and it's fun. Now for the people who actually believe it?  Short bus window lickers and you can't fix stupid.
958775150752694272 2018-01-31 18:53:03 UTC <rbmills321> @POTUS @SenToomey Progress=90% of working Americans, particularly public servants and first responders, have even heavier shackles to drag into their old age. Doesn't sound like progress to me.
958768232210583554 2018-01-31 18:25:34 UTC <rbmills321> @FWGMills After 40 fucking years of these republican twat waffles spouting off about the "founding fathers", they want to pull this post WWII boner booster bullshit on us?

954791046982008833 2018-01-20 19:01:39 UTC <rbmills321> @rickygervais Speaking about facts and truth gives the religious a lizard-brain charlie horse. So they either ignore it or get aggressive.
