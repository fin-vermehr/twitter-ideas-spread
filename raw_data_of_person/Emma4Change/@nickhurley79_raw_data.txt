915383939618963457 2017-10-03 01:11:52 UTC <nickhurley79> @20committee @guav So I wish conservatives would just admit they don't mind these deaths as long as they keep their guns
915383818877587457 2017-10-03 01:11:24 UTC <nickhurley79> @20committee @guav Australia confiscated and destroyed the majority of guns after a similar incident. These mass killings don't happen anymore there.
915382849695567874 2017-10-03 01:07:33 UTC <nickhurley79> @guav because I don't think ppl who have hobby of shooting assault rifles is even worth mentioning when I think of these constant mass shootings
915378446221627392 2017-10-03 00:50:03 UTC <nickhurley79> @20committee @guav But what value is there keeping it legal if it would have saved one life if didn't have it? What hunter needs it?
915375337776861185 2017-10-03 00:37:42 UTC <nickhurley79> @20committee @guav So why not make it more difficult?  We have seat belts. We have more security. But when it comes to guns nothing. It makes not sense.
915371134220144640 2017-10-03 00:20:59 UTC <nickhurley79> @20committee @guav idea is next person now, or 20 yrs from now wld not be able to buy them. Why have security at airports if terroists intend to kill us

915362185399996416 2017-10-03 23:45:26 UTC <nickhurley79> @20committee As an anti gun liberal, the problem arises from the unwillingness of the right to DO ANYTHING. It drives us on the left to be "hysterical"
