965399076543004674 2018-02-18 01:34:10 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san But honestly indie labels/IDW/Dark Horse aren't really bad about cataloging from what I've seen too
965398816957566976 2018-02-18 01:33:08 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san DC is a lot better about story arcs than Marvel, I feel. Granted Marvel TPB's will have volume numbers depending on the writer/artist team but I've always found DC arcs far easier to break into

948224976561278976 2018-01-02 16:10:26 UTC <verygooster> @WHMPodcast 1) Happy new year, WHM!  2) holy crap I went into this just expecting a knockoff Toy Story/Secret Life of Pets plot which it still sort of is but holy shit is it insane

948044488030801920 2018-01-01 04:13:14 UTC <verygooster> Like amidst the classist and racist stuff (and however Barnum really was IRL) I weirdly appreciate this movie unironically wanting to entertain? In 2017 (well, 2018) -- I mean I've listened to the soundtrack a fair bit today so
948044487196135434 2018-01-01 04:13:14 UTC <verygooster> I keep thinking about The Greatest Showman which I saw yesterday which left me feeling more pensive than necessary but it's a good looking movie and fairly entertaining (dancing bartender!!)

936679460975280136 2017-12-01 19:32:40 UTC <verygooster> Probably not but man Jimmy Fallon somehow makes FICTIONAL nostalgia obnoxious
936679327558782976 2017-12-01 19:32:09 UTC <verygooster> Popstar has a scene where Conner4real goes on Jimmy Fallon who has them do the "Donkey Roll" bit and despite it being a Universal movie I still wonder if that's some hidden dig on Fallon's overreliance on nostalgia

931268067966976002 2017-11-16 21:09:44 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 I could understand that for sure. On the flip side, maybe another good-to-great Batman reboot would finally do it for him at the same time.  Although at this point though also I'm super out of touch at who the hot 30-and-under actors are so \_()_/

930594078860988417 2017-11-14 00:31:32 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 Just feel like if they're gonna build one big universe of characters just don't one-off your villain. Design a larger story arc instead of a singular hero's arc which is what a lot of those movies feel like (I haven't seen Thor Ragnarok though)
930590754958925825 2017-11-14 00:18:20 UTC <verygooster> hot take I feel like what we call "villain problems" in comic movies should probably be called "establishing cinematic universe problems" even if third acts always just devolve into drawn out CGI battles

930116023147286529 2017-11-13 16:51:55 UTC <verygooster> @Kyoufu2011 That's my point. Sonic exists because Sega wanted to look edgy compared to Nintendo and that's it, and everything about Sonic to me has just come off like they didn't think harder beyond that since.
930115105492291584 2017-11-13 16:48:16 UTC <verygooster> The real answer to "What can fix Sonic?" is to go back to 1990-91 and maybe design a character and mechanic that isn't reactionary to an 8-bit plumber you want to show uphttps://www.resetera.com/threads/what-can-fix-sonic.5772/

929857001148108800 2017-11-12 23:42:39 UTC <verygooster> @drewmagary I mean when was the last time a team so blatantly and obviously quit on the coach and it's on display on the field for all to see?
929851800819204096 2017-11-12 23:21:59 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I don't even think McAdoo did anything after the dog pee thing in Philly until Mara stepped in. He's super inconsistent about who he calls out publicly and not. I'm sure that didn't help his case.

923599437317984257 2017-10-26 17:17:20 UTC <verygooster> @GaijinDensetsu On ResetEra, yup. OP wants people to provide or PM from old (GAF) account to prove identity and I can't do that since I pretty much nuked all my credentials there lol.
923598981824942080 2017-10-26 17:15:31 UTC <verygooster> Whoops. One wall I hit nuking my old account. Can't migrate B/S/T feedback over, especially since my ISP ceased providing email service so I can't even get in to try and get a password reset. Oops.
923597573235068928 2017-10-26 17:09:55 UTC <verygooster> @alex_navarro was kind of hoping for like a more ... focused? AC game. Like I'm sure it's fine (I find the series fine overally but it DID need a break) but... sounds like another "wait for a sale" for me.

919005225633157120 2017-10-13 01:01:34 UTC <verygooster> @eboland11 yeah what was this team thinking getting a player whose strike zone is at like at his ankles
919003968197615616 2017-10-13 00:56:34 UTC <verygooster> on the flip side, you're going to call a ball at the ankles of a 6'7 player a strike? Okay!
919003525136470017 2017-10-13 00:54:49 UTC <verygooster> Low ball and a Gardner check swing and you're booing? Okay!
918974483419009025 2017-10-13 22:59:25 UTC <verygooster> Criticizing Eli (for that delay of game) was never the issue, but that he would refuse to call ANY OTHER PLAYER out for their poor play, especially a certain left tackle and first-round cornerback

917097797505159169 2017-10-08 18:42:08 UTC <verygooster> "Saw some good things out there." -Ben McAdoo on a 9-10 Giants loss against the 1-4 Chargers
917095889881223171 2017-10-08 18:34:33 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n Only touchdown scored by the RB, who then got taken out of the rotation by McAdoo
917095536439758849 2017-10-08 18:33:09 UTC <verygooster> @ryandisdier The Giants somehow made "an 0-4 team PLAYING DOWN to an 0-4 team" possible. Bravo
917093069576687617 2017-10-08 18:23:21 UTC <verygooster> by the way @VP @realDonaldTrump the two of you and all your cronies and your sheep and bots can spare me trying to shift this whole anthem narrative to the military. You shit on them practically daily anyway.

915694233792729094 2017-10-04 21:44:52 UTC <verygooster> So even if you have Starz as part of your TV package some movies are locked out unless you shell out more for the streaming sub which is such a load of horse shithttps://twitter.com/verygooster/status/915678497082880000

915689461433937925 2017-10-04 21:25:54 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII I actually didn't mind him calling Eli out for that delay of game vs Detroit but it's not a good look to easily call your QB out but not call out your O-line for shit play or your WRs for drops either, etc.
915684537933402112 2017-10-04 21:06:21 UTC <verygooster> @Wario64 what a shame  Sonic 06 is disc only

912062020563996673 2017-09-24 21:11:45 UTC <verygooster> @EthanGSN Like no coach's film breakdown of the final minute or the miss tackling changes that he left an entire touchdown on the board. Ben sucks
912061885125709824 2017-09-24 21:11:13 UTC <verygooster> @EthanGSN Last week he kept the offense from attempting a endof 1st-half drive. This week he leaves an entire touchdown on the board to puff his chest
912059847654428673 2017-09-24 21:03:07 UTC <verygooster> I just can't get over that.
912059818558545921 2017-09-24 21:03:00 UTC <verygooster> Sorry. No breakdown of the mistakes and penalties and "what's a catch" isn't going to change that the coach gave away 6 points.
912059391112826881 2017-09-24 21:01:18 UTC <verygooster> @Giants McAdoo gave away 6 points.

912051615787552768 2017-09-24 20:30:24 UTC <verygooster> Wow if only an arrogant coach hadn't puffed his chest out and hadn't left 6 points on the board

909992592548524037 2017-09-18 04:08:35 UTC <verygooster> Find someone who protects your QB the way Ereck Flowers protects his Twitter account #NYG #NYGiantspic.twitter.com/NmrQXGLEVN
909990768462442496 2017-09-18 04:01:20 UTC <verygooster> @bigblueview This is a bad team and this season will very well be over by next week. May as well scotch tape the Titanic.
909986409599074305 2017-09-18 03:44:01 UTC <verygooster> No sense of urgency and Eli is trying not to die which is why he took the Captain Checkdown cap from Alex Smith
909986074809831424 2017-09-18 03:42:41 UTC <verygooster> it's funny given how much he went for it on 4th down last year, but that final minute in 1st half was HOT GARBAGE & then just runs down 2TDs
909985929774776320 2017-09-18 03:42:07 UTC <verygooster> I understand McAdoo has to coach around his offense's deficiencies (woof) and protect his QB but I can't stand how scared he coaches
909983103183147009 2017-09-18 03:30:53 UTC <verygooster> @NJDevils Let's play some awesome hockey this year!
909982403174764546 2017-09-18 03:28:06 UTC <verygooster> @Yankees if you can take the AL East I would really appreciate it thanks
909968819774476289 2017-09-18 02:34:07 UTC <verygooster> @bigblueview good luck to the beat writers talking this fanbase off the ledge
909967801221337088 2017-09-18 02:30:04 UTC <verygooster> WHY is McAdoo going back to Perkins when Darkwa's had the better game????????????? DARKWA would probably have SCORED.

909962227708579841 2017-09-18 02:07:56 UTC <verygooster> Orleans Darkwa for like what, 4-5 yards?  Okay see you in the 4th quarter!
909958450851061760 2017-09-18 01:52:55 UTC <verygooster> McAdoo is such a coward my god
909957183172902912 2017-09-18 01:47:53 UTC <verygooster> I hope Ereck Flowers does a better job blocking me on Twitter than he does in this game because it's time to move on from him
909946353710698496 2017-09-18 01:04:51 UTC <verygooster> the giants moved the football  across the field  and scored points  what sorcery is this
909945595787431936 2017-09-18 01:01:50 UTC <verygooster> Real talk I'm more happy that the defense is getting a rest than the offense actually doing anything

909936689413582848 2017-09-18 00:26:27 UTC <verygooster> Hey let's not embarrass ourselves in front of that 2007 team maybe????

885634909917900801 2017-07-13 22:59:51 UTC <verygooster> Oh I also very much enjoyed Charlize Theron as a villain and the movie did the "author of all your pain" shit 1000x better than Spectre did

875747188260909057 2017-06-16 16:09:34 UTC <verygooster> @jeffgerstmann @VinnyCaravella listening to Beastcast: was '07 the E3 when they didn't want to be a big spectacle, but more meeting focused?
875744466090561536 2017-06-16 15:58:45 UTC <verygooster> @DanRyckert Happy Birthday, Awesome Gamer!

875723990639288322 2017-06-16 14:37:24 UTC <verygooster> @NECA_TOYS Have you read about Konami actually blackballing ex-employees and apparently they're not allowed to put them on their rsum? Pretty crazy.
875715502466846720 2017-06-16 14:03:40 UTC <verygooster> @IOInteractive Congrats and best of luck to the team. Hitman is just fantastic
875704659461242880 2017-06-16 13:20:35 UTC <verygooster> @TomHolland1996 @NY_Comic_Con I wish Bruce Campbell as Mysterio had happened in the Raimi era

875501542647975936 2017-06-15 23:53:28 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 and he was already eating shit this morning for a quote that amounted to "Yeah we announced Scalebound too early"
875500152357826560 2017-06-15 23:47:56 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 I get it in general and maybe that's in a way out of his hands, but they can't continue NOT having a solution months later
875499386612178945 2017-06-15 23:44:54 UTC <verygooster> This is ridiculously frustrating. Backing up and/or transferring saves shouldn't require the same PR answer you give about Mother 3.pic.twitter.com/oftNKhih6o
875494787910074368 2017-06-15 23:26:38 UTC <verygooster> Also I have to finally play Metro: Last Light...
875494181606760448 2017-06-15 23:24:13 UTC <verygooster> "Honorable mention" is The Evil Within 2. I wasn't 100% on the first game but I was into it enough that I'll play part two for sure.

875162427666595841 2017-06-14 01:25:57 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 If it's coming to Netflix then probably when it's closer to the S2 premiere , but I don't have Netflix 
875161128359297024 2017-06-14 01:20:47 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 Let me catch up on your damned show, NBC!!!

875126257272410113 2017-06-14 23:02:13 UTC <verygooster> @jasonschreier Ron Howard narration: "And then all those games were delayed."
875124769078861828 2017-06-14 22:56:18 UTC <verygooster> If people are digging that Kojima event cool but all I took away from that so far was:  "Mr. Kojima, are awesome are movies?" "So awesome."

874740740290641922 2017-06-13 21:30:19 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR Likely going digital for Mario Odyssey, maybe Rabbids Xenoblade... depends on the file size I guess

874692037760647169 2017-06-13 18:16:47 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I do start to wonder if all those other Mario outfits in Odyssey eventually get amiibo

874078787616604160 2017-06-11 01:39:57 UTC <verygooster> I would almost respect someone if they just said "This thing is not something I want to think about" instead of pretending to take a stand
874078611225096193 2017-06-11 01:39:15 UTC <verygooster> "I can separate the art from the artist" as used today, to me anyway, is just a roundabout way of just saying "I don't give a shit"https://twitter.com/XEECEEVEVO/status/874072388547125248

873638614990802945 2017-06-10 20:30:51 UTC <verygooster> @DoubleUHarrison I actually think you kind of nailed it indirectly: I'd probably would rather just fire up Overwatch.

834778535390765060 2017-02-23 14:54:46 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda it's impressive that they couldn't even get a dedicated retro plug-and-play device right (in terms of availability anyway)
834777543295303680 2017-02-23 14:50:50 UTC <verygooster> @dasme especially given NES Classic availability problems
834776637258469376 2017-02-23 14:47:14 UTC <verygooster> @dasme kinda wonder how they approach it then if they heard/took Wii U VC criticisms to heart
834776406517231616 2017-02-23 14:46:19 UTC <verygooster> so no VC at Switch launch, but if there was it'd probably be like SMB, Balloon Fight, Ice Climbers, Metroid, and that's it

828592652752973825 2017-02-06 13:14:17 UTC <verygooster> Baffling. Letting Brady score in every possession in from the 3rd qtr on sure didn't help, but dunno how you botch this drive so badly.https://twitter.com/KNegandhiESPN/status/828586867545272320

820411887510814720 2017-01-14 23:26:51 UTC <verygooster> @dannyodwyer Loose change is probably what kept him from leaning over the balcony for you to push him :P
820411725220630528 2017-01-14 23:26:12 UTC <verygooster> TIL people REALLY hate the Seahawks on my Twitter timeline lol
820410973542580224 2017-01-14 23:23:13 UTC <verygooster> @johntv I hope they put the effort into VC stuff that the NES games in the Classic Mini got
820410283957112832 2017-01-14 23:20:28 UTC <verygooster> @jasonschreier wonder how much Zelda at launch helps the really sparse launch day lineup along with no 'Wii' brand confusion this time
820404610959638529 2017-01-14 22:57:56 UTC <verygooster> Seahawks playing like they just saw the Switch launch lineup
820397017906184192 2017-01-14 22:27:45 UTC <verygooster> I mean probably not but goddamn that Hester run was nice
820396945365725185 2017-01-14 22:27:28 UTC <verygooster> I am sick of fucking sick ass KOR/punt returns called back for illegal block or god knows what else... has to happen like 75% of the time
820395745161474057 2017-01-14 22:22:42 UTC <verygooster> How does Russell miss basketball there
820392494932357121 2017-01-14 22:09:47 UTC <verygooster> Devin Hester. In 2017.
820391804344406016 2017-01-14 22:07:02 UTC <verygooster> Am absolutely loving Blood & Wine. Just any excuse to keep playing The Witcher 3, really. @witchergame @CDPROJEKTRED
820310879539490816 2017-01-14 16:45:28 UTC <verygooster> @Phazon4G ah I see. Amazon US has micro SD cards on sale all the damn time so not an issue for me either way
820310173659099137 2017-01-14 16:42:40 UTC <verygooster> @Phazon4G is it only Micro SD or can switch use an external HDD also?
820110878800576512 2017-01-13 03:30:45 UTC <verygooster> It makes me so happy that @VinnyCaravella calls the 2nd base boss in Contra "Optimus Prime" because I've been doing that for like 25 years
820072954428096513 2017-01-13 01:00:03 UTC <verygooster> the chip on debit cards now is ruining my life
820058504992092164 2017-01-13 00:02:38 UTC <verygooster> Too bad the show got too into the Rambaldi stuff as it went on. Could blame Abrams but he left at some point I think
820057994402664448 2017-01-13 00:00:36 UTC <verygooster> Every episode in season one recaps the show's premise and then there's an entire episode that does the same thing lol
820057784729399298 2017-01-13 23:59:46 UTC <verygooster> So a few weeks back I decided of all shows to binge Alias, which I haven't watched in maybe a decade

820007381711147008 2017-01-13 20:39:29 UTC <verygooster> I wonder if down the road there's a Switch SKU with Mario and Luigi color schemed JoyCons
820004336818388998 2017-01-13 20:27:23 UTC <verygooster> @ArcadeGirl64 Yeah I saw that year 1 lineup image but XC2 w a generic "2017" made me think this
819994537061916672 2017-01-13 19:48:27 UTC <verygooster> @jasonschreier No this is the guy she told you not to worry abouthttp://imgur.com/ovGYedx
819994082676264960 2017-01-13 19:46:38 UTC <verygooster> Also seems like Amazon, Walmart, Target, are sold out (for now) but GameStop still has the gray JoyCon Switch set
819993632707121152 2017-01-13 19:44:51 UTC <verygooster> I think I'm looking forward to Giant Bomb's Switch launch stream more than the actual Switch launch
819985633670234112 2017-01-13 19:13:04 UTC <verygooster> @willsmith Surprised I haven't heard "New Dank City" already
819982493940150272 2017-01-13 19:00:35 UTC <verygooster> @antitrop @NeoGAFNewThread for me if not that then Silent Hill 2

819936228288118784 2017-01-13 15:56:45 UTC <verygooster> @therealwienke FAKE RUMORS! A SWITCH HUNT!

819926799375331331 2017-01-13 15:19:17 UTC <verygooster> @Phazon4G I thought that too!! lol
819923582289637380 2017-01-13 15:06:30 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman followed by like a "Why aren't you playing ARMS?" thinkpiece
819922258433110017 2017-01-13 15:01:14 UTC <verygooster> @patrickklepek I stayed away from Best Buy because they overcharged my card to check if I had funds on my Wii U preorder & they cancelled it
819913605021859840 2017-01-13 14:26:51 UTC <verygooster> Not at all surprised Nintendo's stock dropped. Splatoon 2 isn't on a mobile phone and they're not charging $10 for different ink colors.
819913190343667712 2017-01-13 14:25:12 UTC <verygooster> @BombosMedallion the Nintendo site has a YouTube video window embedded
819912710674587648 2017-01-13 14:23:18 UTC <verygooster> @HaroldLi Me last night: "Mario at holiday? maybe I'll wait." This morning: "Zelda at launch. screw it I'm gonna own one anyway *preorder*"
819895028973707265 2017-01-13 13:13:02 UTC <verygooster> I'm always amused when NeoGAF builds themselves up for a Nintendo event and it's almost always a disappointment

817911590108467201 2017-01-07 01:51:33 UTC <verygooster> is there ever a day of the week where there ISN'T a water main break in Jersey Cityhttps://twitter.com/JC_Gov/status/817911461733404673

816111140552015873 2017-01-02 02:37:13 UTC <verygooster> I like when I reply to 18h old tweet because I don't catch the "in case you missed it" right away because Twitter is dumb
816110738674765824 2017-01-02 02:35:37 UTC <verygooster> Amazon did that with Star Trek and I was slightly annoyed. Basically 1 through 6 but not part 4

815979906052001792 2017-01-02 17:55:44 UTC <verygooster> It hasn't differentiated itself from other Ueda titles really even if it has nice moments here and there. Nvm how much I fight w the game
815979328840302592 2017-01-02 17:53:26 UTC <verygooster> TLG so conflicting. For a game that took almost a decade, it's actually mundane and frustrating to play most of the time.

811685120629506048 2016-12-21 21:29:47 UTC <verygooster> I wish everyone would stop talking about Tracer and get back to the real issues like Starbucks cups and black Santa Claus
811670427504361476 2016-12-21 20:31:24 UTC <verygooster> No matter how you feel about 2016, at least it gave us the Shenmue Endurance Run @alex_navarro @VinnyCaravella @DanRyckert
811605034777636864 2016-12-21 16:11:33 UTC <verygooster> I really like it. I was hooked exploring areas. Feels like 2D Zelda/80s Apple II game or something

811354313557737476 2016-12-20 23:35:17 UTC <verygooster> also lord this game pulls plot points out of its ass
811353062845448192 2016-12-20 23:30:19 UTC <verygooster> @ZeoMassicot story-wise I get it but good LORD what were they thinking
811352780027920388 2016-12-20 23:29:11 UTC <verygooster> @ZeoMassicot is that when the city is on lockdown and you have to avoid every fucking cop to get anywhere?
811352345342836736 2016-12-20 23:27:27 UTC <verygooster> Finished Deus Ex: Mankind Divided finally. Enjoyed half of it, found the other half tedious, [ending scene missing]
811351741916712960 2016-12-20 23:25:04 UTC <verygooster> @Deadspin lol "Bob McAdoo"

811258745355378688 2016-12-20 17:15:32 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR you just made the list
811258422989570049 2016-12-20 17:14:15 UTC <verygooster> At the post office. Again.  The line is long. Again.  Doing a return. Again.
811233773467615233 2016-12-20 15:36:18 UTC <verygooster> @alex_navarro my theater does a discount Tuesday kinda thing and I still might go ...
811182416278814720 2016-12-20 12:12:13 UTC <verygooster> @WHMPodcast BvS hands down: Nick Nolte, Holly Hunter, and Steve exploding at how stupid the "Martha" scene was
811070751893815296 2016-12-19 04:48:30 UTC <verygooster> @KSIXI on the same running play twice even. Yeesh

811065910660370432 2016-12-19 04:29:16 UTC <verygooster> @alex_navarro looking on IMDb how did that series not get like 8 million direct to Netflix releases
811061609267429376 2016-12-19 04:12:11 UTC <verygooster> @miDnIghtEr20C the Redskins got a bad PI call but the ref changed his mind lol
811060950879129600 2016-12-19 04:09:34 UTC <verygooster> Weak ass DPI call
811055763120590848 2016-12-19 03:48:57 UTC <verygooster> Some of these Toad rallies can eat shit
811045903628992512 2016-12-19 03:09:46 UTC <verygooster> @NYGDaily I'm guessing you were watching that dumb First Take clip too
811044110924713984 2016-12-19 03:02:39 UTC <verygooster> @miDnIghtEr20C I'm just tired of refs being garbage especially this year and the VP of officiating just sits there with his eyes closed
811042277011456004 2016-12-19 02:55:21 UTC <verygooster> @miDnIghtEr20C I get upset when the refs suck. Cam getting a flag doesn't mean that hit to the head shouldn't be called.
811041386640371714 2016-12-19 02:51:49 UTC <verygooster> This sounds reactionary because of that Cam non-call but maybe a competent person should have Dean Blandino's job
811035711428329473 2016-12-19 02:29:16 UTC <verygooster> @art_stapleton Refs are just straight messing with Cam at that point
811035356237885440 2016-12-19 02:27:51 UTC <verygooster> lmao nope
811035237157404676 2016-12-19 02:27:23 UTC <verygooster> CAM GOT A CALL IN 2016

810872685685342208 2016-12-19 15:41:28 UTC <verygooster> @ByteSizeImp apparently the Suicide Squad project is cancelled and WB Montreal is focusing on that Batman game now
810866256853213184 2016-12-19 15:15:55 UTC <verygooster> My favorite actual reaction to another Batman game: "Day 1 on PC!!" because that went well the last time...
810712159114108932 2016-12-18 05:03:35 UTC <verygooster> Some of Mario Run's little animations here and there mess with how I'm "trained" to react to Super Mario Bros. so I end up frustrated a bit

810697714342182912 2016-12-18 04:06:11 UTC <verygooster> @gazele87 hopefully they learn from that first Battlefront launch
810696793864491009 2016-12-18 04:02:32 UTC <verygooster> One thing about Rogue One: it made me want a Frostbite Dark Forces/Republic Commando-type game so badhttps://twitter.com/gamespot/status/810696232914055168
810690853505208324 2016-12-18 03:38:56 UTC <verygooster> It's fascinating when coaches/coordinators veer away from what works to get cute on playcalling

810617631661297665 2016-12-18 22:47:58 UTC <verygooster> No one needs a movie about it when everyone saw it unfold over social media
810617560995688449 2016-12-18 22:47:41 UTC <verygooster> Making a movie out of the Boston Marathon bombing seems like an old person executive greenlight

810601381434454016 2016-12-18 21:43:24 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd I think my favorite thing about this season besides potential playoffs is MetLife is ACTUALLY loud and I HEAR IT ON TELEVISION
810599394303217664 2016-12-18 21:35:30 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd Just about. Dude checks down so much and I don't blame him partly but Lions' best CB out vs OBJ. Make plays, man!

808148095208984576 2016-12-11 03:14:55 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina Al and Cris: "You may as well take a knee in the end zone on every return"
808143723502641152 2016-12-11 02:57:32 UTC <verygooster> Imagine if the offense was good  Giants could be up 21-7, or 10-7, or 14-7  but no  because 2016 will not allow this

808136342441955329 2016-12-11 02:28:13 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina It's never just that the opponent outplays, it's that they don't even have to try when the Giants take the ball.
808136255007522817 2016-12-11 02:27:52 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina Giants losing isn't even what annoys me. It's that they're so consistent in shooting themselves in the foot.

805818195634491392 2016-12-05 16:56:43 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n Yeah like I don't want to sound like I'm playing the "LOL GAMEZ JERNALZM" card or anything
805814530047692800 2016-12-05 16:42:09 UTC <verygooster> Yeah, I've put up with minor quirks here on games I like and there but when stuff like terrible fps and terrible camera and misc jank, eh
805814266330828800 2016-12-05 16:41:07 UTC <verygooster> --but there's a disappointment when I read "this game has a fuckton of performance issues but I liked it so I didn't care"

804524562536861696 2016-12-01 03:16:17 UTC <verygooster> I think the only way Bradford wins this game at this point is to go full Flacco special on every possession

803619359205642240 2016-11-29 15:19:20 UTC <verygooster> When there have been plenty of good Superman stories out there to check out
803619279388090369 2016-11-29 15:19:01 UTC <verygooster> And though I'm not the hugest Superman guy I do take slight umbrage at the lazy "he's near-invulernable = boring"
803619079500091392 2016-11-29 15:18:13 UTC <verygooster> Good read. The writer seems to appreciate Superman's empathy which would arguably need to be core to the game design.
803617133317894144 2016-11-29 15:10:29 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san Saving people as a side objective would get boring fast. Setting it in metropolis would get boring (to me anyway).
803617028221173761 2016-11-29 15:10:04 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san Like MAYBE a good Superman game can happen? But agree conceptually: shouldn't simply be open-world/side objective game.

803037297419485184 2016-11-27 00:46:26 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd which sounds very "DUH" when you read it that way but it's disappointing
803037231405371392 2016-11-27 00:46:10 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd With the D being as bad as it was last year McAdoo cranked it up but now that they're bailing us out he's okay w/ the calling
803037081694076928 2016-11-27 00:45:34 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd read an interesting take on the NYG subreddit of all places:
803035822735970305 2016-11-27 00:40:34 UTC <verygooster> I mean imagine if the offense didn't make me want to pull my teeth out
803035512449728512 2016-11-27 00:39:20 UTC <verygooster> Somehow  Some way  Miraculously  The Giants are 2nd in the NFC

802967295140052992 2016-11-27 20:08:16 UTC <verygooster> I hate watching this offense like 78% of the time
802960788591808513 2016-11-27 19:42:24 UTC <verygooster> Are we gonna talk about how the Giants let Josh McCown convert on 2nd & 30pic.twitter.com/ZLwGGPh6ta

802949101604245505 2016-11-27 18:55:58 UTC <verygooster> I'm just gonna assume the horrible opening drives is McAdoo letting opposing defenses' guard down
802946589975347201 2016-11-27 18:45:59 UTC <verygooster> @RyanLuz apparently it's Jeff Tripplette's crew at the Chargers game today so yeah...pic.twitter.com/zmT0ySh1Be

802943105662091264 2016-11-27 18:32:09 UTC <verygooster> Apparently you can overlook because that was the 3rd or 4th three-and-out.
802942931481067521 2016-11-27 18:31:27 UTC <verygooster> This is why I can't stand all the narratives before these games: "We can't overlook the other team." "We can't take their record lightly."
802941634858074116 2016-11-27 18:26:18 UTC <verygooster> can't tell on Twitter if that's coffee or chili
802940942802042880 2016-11-27 18:23:33 UTC <verygooster> I notice from writers more often than not that portrayal of something = condoning the action rather than break it down
802940260846043136 2016-11-27 18:20:50 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda i dunno i'm sure I've used it at least 20 times lol

802134945783316482 2016-11-25 13:00:48 UTC <verygooster> or I guess $35+ games will discount to GCU but not the $29.99 titles Best Buy has listed

790363214274068481 2016-10-23 01:24:09 UTC <verygooster> Super fucking lame but not surprised because this show has no spine

790361854325448704 2016-10-23 01:18:44 UTC <verygooster> He said it like 50 times during that part. Shit's gonna be in my nightmares tonight
790358607606976512 2016-10-23 01:05:50 UTC <verygooster> They're really gonna drag this shit out, huh #TheWalkingDead
790356944422862848 2016-10-23 00:59:14 UTC <verygooster> God that Walking Dead finale was so bad. So bad.
790353596592390144 2016-10-23 00:45:56 UTC <verygooster> We figured it out eventually lol. It was hilarious though.
790353237425713152 2016-10-23 00:44:30 UTC <verygooster> Falcons get off to a hot start and then lose a game SHOCKED.
790345951378628608 2016-10-23 00:15:33 UTC <verygooster> So @Sheriff0fPaddys and I are like stuck on this windy turret part of Gears 4 wondering if we're missing something lol
790336526668460032 2016-10-23 23:38:06 UTC <verygooster> There's a Swarm in Gears 4 that does Triple H's entrance
790304636838240256 2016-10-23 21:31:23 UTC <verygooster> BIG PLAY *called back by flag* NFL sucks
790301078130716672 2016-10-23 21:17:14 UTC <verygooster> i could do a party if you want. I have ear buds and a mic should work
790299109525753856 2016-10-23 21:09:25 UTC <verygooster> yes this Pats-Steelers game is trash
790295064547295232 2016-10-23 20:53:21 UTC <verygooster> I am totally in for Bernie being the budget chairman
790281159854948352 2016-10-23 19:58:05 UTC <verygooster> Red Kryptonite stories are so fun and Supergirl is no exception.
790280869458108419 2016-10-23 19:56:56 UTC <verygooster> Nah I'm down to play lol Just got to move my Xbox
790280427453968384 2016-10-23 19:55:11 UTC <verygooster> I thought you got called into work?
790279956165193730 2016-10-23 19:53:18 UTC <verygooster> Damn I stopped watching Red Zone to fire up a Supergirl episode lol
790275803976171520 2016-10-23 19:36:48 UTC <verygooster> @LegacyZ3RO lol damn. Rove ain't even gonna try any of his magic math from 2012?
790269672025366528 2016-10-23 19:12:26 UTC <verygooster> Maybe revenue has to drop or something. Just amazed what a clueless guy Goodell is. Or maybe he's not clueless & doesn't care
790267090229944320 2016-10-23 19:02:11 UTC <verygooster> Collins has to be NFC DPOTW especially after these games. Jesus.
790266830938107904 2016-10-23 19:01:09 UTC <verygooster> @hesstoytruck @TheHumble_21 @Giants has to be NFC DPOTW
790266692207308801 2016-10-23 19:00:36 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman "TRUMP IS JUST TRYING TO KEEP RELIGION OUT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT"
790265656851722241 2016-10-23 18:56:29 UTC <verygooster> Feel like everything WWE watchers complained about the last few years applies here. Bad booking. Roger is Vince.
790265538698248192 2016-10-23 18:56:01 UTC <verygooster> Thursday night game is Jags-Titans lol. This league is a joke.
790264528730816514 2016-10-23 18:52:00 UTC <verygooster> I'm watching but I still hope NFL ratings keep tanking tbh
790264339320205312 2016-10-23 18:51:15 UTC <verygooster> @austin_walker Thanks. Watching the trailer on the App Store. Might have to grab this one!
790264082477834240 2016-10-23 18:50:14 UTC <verygooster> Breeland sucks too
790263087190446081 2016-10-23 18:46:17 UTC <verygooster> @austin_walker what game is this?
790262824165670917 2016-10-23 18:45:14 UTC <verygooster> dude got paid to cover OBJ basically and he didn't even do that
790258565240029185 2016-10-23 18:28:18 UTC <verygooster> The Giants might actually have a better o-line than the Vikings. Ouch.
790257663749787648 2016-10-23 18:24:43 UTC <verygooster> AJ GREEN  LMAO BROWNS
790254008518729728 2016-10-23 18:10:12 UTC <verygooster> @katienolan must be Sunday!
790244718613520388 2016-10-23 17:33:17 UTC <verygooster> Eagles and Vikings playing like it's Thursday
790243197964476417 2016-10-23 17:27:15 UTC <verygooster> I'VE BEEN WAITIN' ALL DAY FOR FUCKBALL ... DAY 
790239551369408513 2016-10-23 17:12:45 UTC <verygooster> @JordanRaanan Offensive line isn't talented enough to build a wall to protect him anyway
790233737057402880 2016-10-23 16:49:39 UTC <verygooster> Also McAdoo's playcaling has been abhorrent at this point and doing too much. Just hand it off to Sullivan.
790232659398123524 2016-10-23 16:45:22 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd Yep! Also it is becoming clearer that Eli and McAdoo do not trust that line
790230806178439168 2016-10-23 16:38:00 UTC <verygooster> Giants really needed that win, now above .500, and now headed into a bye week with some chance of resting up and getting healthy
790230405983117312 2016-10-23 16:36:25 UTC <verygooster> @art_stapleton Is this the first game they've won by a full touchdown this year?
790230199275253761 2016-10-23 16:35:35 UTC <verygooster> Props to Jeff Fisher for really really living up to thispic.twitter.com/sFy7c2VgPI
790229878717181952 2016-10-23 16:34:19 UTC <verygooster> WOW lmao
790227476333101056 2016-10-23 16:24:46 UTC <verygooster> Wow, Rams
790225270229860352 2016-10-23 16:16:00 UTC <verygooster> I dunno why you would try that a second time Keenum but thanks for the gift.
790225060338499584 2016-10-23 16:15:10 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n DRC thought so too!
790224658259931136 2016-10-23 16:13:34 UTC <verygooster> Woof that 3rd & 22 conversion was killer
790223628981919744 2016-10-23 16:09:29 UTC <verygooster> @shinobi602 My favorite is when you switch to Michael and he's driving his family somewhere and I just run them over repeatedly lol
790222526169411584 2016-10-23 16:05:06 UTC <verygooster> @RVacchianoSNY Yes. great they scored but not gonna pretend the running game is hot all of a sudden
790221153184935936 2016-10-23 15:59:39 UTC <verygooster> Collins Beckhampic.twitter.com/6KlZEV5hfi
790219473437458436 2016-10-23 15:52:58 UTC <verygooster> @bigblueview whoever gets the next score wins. Easily.
790216725606334464 2016-10-23 15:42:03 UTC <verygooster> This is the playcalling. This is it. This is how it's going to be the rest of the year because the o-line is bad.pic.twitter.com/0LKsIJ0W97
790215784991756288 2016-10-23 15:38:19 UTC <verygooster> Breaking news Larry Donnell sucks.
790204460710686720 2016-10-23 14:53:19 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina Keep exposing themselves with this TE in the backfield formation

790194744114737152 2016-10-23 14:14:42 UTC <verygooster> @zackreese I remember going to TRU the Friday it came out. Played from about 4pm until 7am the following day
790192080618487808 2016-10-23 14:04:07 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina I say this is just a bad team

790185809685147649 2016-10-23 13:39:12 UTC <verygooster> How did the Giants get so bad on turnovers?
790022013335330816 2016-10-22 02:48:20 UTC <verygooster> @zackreese lmao hell of a year to start following them
790021796259065856 2016-10-22 02:47:28 UTC <verygooster> I legit dozed off during the 8th inning though lol

789565160318967808 2016-10-21 20:32:58 UTC <verygooster> I'll take "My kid is a pain in the ass"
789565063061536768 2016-10-21 20:32:35 UTC <verygooster> Maybe speaking too soon but super glad JD and Marcus aren't written/introduced anyway as "estranged father/son, son is mad at dad"
789559093212184576 2016-10-21 20:08:51 UTC <verygooster> Is Twitter on iOS busted or what
789548298403192832 2016-10-21 19:25:58 UTC <verygooster> watching the WWE 2k17 quick look and it looks so bad
789529305470660608 2016-10-21 18:10:29 UTC <verygooster> Plumeria and Team Skull look like Jet Set Radio characters
789518740174012416 2016-10-21 17:28:30 UTC <verygooster> Man I'm already kinda taken aback by the world in this Pokmon Sun/Moon demo. I can't wait for this game.

789503397292568576 2016-10-21 16:27:32 UTC <verygooster> @BigBlueUnited Mara showing he's no better than any other profiting NFL owner
789494616059965440 2016-10-21 15:52:39 UTC <verygooster> Nintendo Switch got announced before Sombra
789479564007309312 2016-10-21 14:52:50 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n Giants can't play their bull shit "class organization" card any more. Mara and the league botched this badly.
789478867169927168 2016-10-21 14:50:04 UTC <verygooster> Give me a fucking break, Eli. Odell & the kicking net is a distraction.https://twitter.com/greggrosenthal/status/789446948675727360
789478350385471488 2016-10-21 14:48:01 UTC <verygooster> @janesports "Distraction." Come the fuck on, Eli.
789477830191149056 2016-10-21 14:45:57 UTC <verygooster> Props to the state for upgrading the flip-phones their employees had been using until yesterday for non-exploding Galaxy S phones
789472754370240512 2016-10-21 14:25:46 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I was probably 5 of those views alone
789470929156014080 2016-10-21 14:18:31 UTC <verygooster> @ArcadeGirl64 Or at least a successor
789470893718302720 2016-10-21 14:18:23 UTC <verygooster> @ArcadeGirl64 The kind of community and creativity fostered thanks to MM, would be super disappointing if there's no Switch port

789290554341351424 2016-10-20 02:21:47 UTC <verygooster> @wlatham92 I would try one but hearing "DEEP FRIED TWINKIES" and then "LIVE BETTER" cracked me up

789277946871738368 2016-10-20 01:31:41 UTC <verygooster> Goodell can't figure out why NFL ratings are lower than usual.  Maybe it's because Matt Barkley is quarterbacking a game in 2016
789274746340929536 2016-10-20 01:18:58 UTC <verygooster> Just realized Hank from Supergirl is in COD IW
789273646976135169 2016-10-20 01:14:36 UTC <verygooster> RIP Brian Hoyer, possibly the best Bears QB of all time

789240973276672000 2016-10-20 23:04:46 UTC <verygooster> @KelsODonnell Like when Mara was being told this stuff was the cleaning guy vacuuming too loud while signing Brown's contract??
789240559412113408 2016-10-20 23:03:07 UTC <verygooster> I'm more embarrassed about how Giants/Mara/NFL handled this Josh Brown thing than the last four fucking seasons
789240287977766913 2016-10-20 23:02:02 UTC <verygooster> @AlexSinclairNFL And of course Goodell isn't anywhere to be seen but hey THOSE TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATIONS & INTEGRITY OF THE GAME etc etc
789240133967028224 2016-10-20 23:01:25 UTC <verygooster> @AlexSinclairNFL Yup. The MOMENT they got a whiff of this Brown should have been gone.
789239729606844420 2016-10-20 22:59:49 UTC <verygooster> @AlexSinclairNFL The Giants are .500 and I still hate this season

789125586631417856 2016-10-20 15:26:15 UTC <verygooster> @Sawyer_DAA That was my initial 'fear' per se. I LOVED RDR's desert design but didn't feel like a type of geography I needed to revisit
789124029366038528 2016-10-20 15:20:04 UTC <verygooster> @dasme I know it's just an advertisement but just looks like my hands couldn't deal with the Joy-Con... things... with the size difference
789121150592937984 2016-10-20 15:08:38 UTC <verygooster> @Wrath2X Yeah, usually it's the teaser, first trailer, game explanation, final trailer/TV spot
789119576902631424 2016-10-20 15:02:22 UTC <verygooster> That was it? #RDR2
789118363326906368 2016-10-20 14:57:33 UTC <verygooster> So I CAN use a Pro Controller on just that screen, right?
789114627372220421 2016-10-20 14:42:42 UTC <verygooster> @Wrath2X imagine if a Switch logo appeared at the end alongside PS4/Xbox One
789111552267935744 2016-10-20 14:30:29 UTC <verygooster> Why does it look like a horror movie puzzle trap
789110460947783680 2016-10-20 14:26:09 UTC <verygooster> I wonder if I am reading too much into the Splatoon part where Nintendo might have some esports interest?
789109675816022016 2016-10-20 14:23:02 UTC <verygooster> And @ArcadeGirl64 sounding likehttps://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/789109380939644928
789109299222081536 2016-10-20 14:21:32 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I already feel like my hands are too big for them watching the one dude use it NES-controller style
789108912620437504 2016-10-20 14:20:00 UTC <verygooster> I just want that portable screen to be good and bright and sharp
789108556045885440 2016-10-20 14:18:35 UTC <verygooster> @Kyoufu2011 I keep seeing it is but no source
789108142437261312 2016-10-20 14:16:56 UTC <verygooster> @setaimx Take Two is one of the listed partners and NBA 2K was in that trailer
789107610024902656 2016-10-20 14:14:49 UTC <verygooster> @ByteSizeImp short cast tonight?
789107496778694657 2016-10-20 14:14:22 UTC <verygooster> @Dystify Confirmed?
789107425974579200 2016-10-20 14:14:05 UTC <verygooster> @Wrath2X I like the gunmetal color too if thats what the final product will look like
789106408075698178 2016-10-20 14:10:03 UTC <verygooster> I had liked the possibility of Wii U off-tv play but I grew to loathe that screen over time
789106264555028480 2016-10-20 14:09:29 UTC <verygooster> I mean, I only take my 3DS to cons. Portable Switch could be fun around the house if that screen is bright and sharp enough
789105915677044736 2016-10-20 14:08:05 UTC <verygooster> I am already entertaining the possibility of lining up at Nintendo NY for this thing. I can just Uber back. :P
789105400369020928 2016-10-20 14:06:02 UTC <verygooster> @SuperNintendad I mean wouldnt it be either 2K or Live?
789105152288493568 2016-10-20 14:05:03 UTC <verygooster> I can play Switch games portable with that Pro-looking controller right? Because my hands might be too big for those little sticks
789105007916441601 2016-10-20 14:04:29 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda NBA 2K

789091878775947264 2016-10-20 13:12:19 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR I'm not saying I want like this low-key drama Logan looks to be from Captain America, but that this is what I want now versus that
789091515326930944 2016-10-20 13:10:52 UTC <verygooster> Supergirl being the outlier which I've been enjoying because it's the only spectacle I'm watching right now really
789091155992535040 2016-10-20 13:09:26 UTC <verygooster> I know the desire for bombast and spectacle is still there but this is why I took to Netflix shows more than DC/MCU movies etc. as of late
789090954439487488 2016-10-20 13:08:38 UTC <verygooster> If Logan goes in the direction it looks like it goes, this is more or less what I want with these comic characters nowadays
789090269123715076 2016-10-20 13:05:55 UTC <verygooster> Okay I really liked that Logan trailer
789081007064485888 2016-10-20 12:29:07 UTC <verygooster> Legit hope NX is still March, even if the tail end of the month because that'd totally be my birthday gift :)
789079698022203393 2016-10-20 12:23:55 UTC <verygooster> Hillary: "The oppression of the Sith will never return! You have lost!"  Trump: "No... no no no YOU ARE THE PUPPET!"
789077680075440129 2016-10-20 12:15:53 UTC <verygooster> @Phazon4G 3 minutes is plenty of time to show Metroid Prime 4, F-Zero FX, Pokmon HD, Super Mario NX, Mario Kart 9, Animal Crossing, Zelda

788932505516773376 2016-10-19 02:39:01 UTC <verygooster> I don't participate in the Obama cult of personality enough to care either way if he gets four more years
788928806530719745 2016-10-19 02:24:19 UTC <verygooster> Like Hillary HAS to be embarrassed to fuckin share this stage and tradition with this dude, right?

788925401049468928 2016-10-19 02:10:47 UTC <verygooster> Trump actually took the bait and played the "rigged" card  you  just  playyyyyyyeeeeedd  yourrrrrrrr  sellffffffffffffffffffffffff
788924790899892225 2016-10-19 02:08:22 UTC <verygooster> Agree that HIllary was off re: Saudi Arabia and Qatar  but holy fuck her entire deck is just trap cards
788923529404223488 2016-10-19 02:03:21 UTC <verygooster> Didn't the charity watchdog groups give the CLinton Foundation high marks?  But sure, criminal enterprise

788810625690533888 2016-10-19 18:34:43 UTC <verygooster> Don't really understand the "LOL MS SPIN" on that Xbox One promo. Didn't they take #1 in Aug-Sep or whenever? No kidding they'll market that

788421266441113600 2016-10-18 16:47:32 UTC <verygooster> NX plot thickens
788397479028989952 2016-10-18 15:13:01 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san And it's hard for sure because we have different experiences but not falling back to stereotypes shouldn't be hard
788397384501960704 2016-10-18 15:12:38 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san when I attempt to write fiction I just want to write characters as living, breathing people, and not pigeonhole them in a role
788397258983243776 2016-10-18 15:12:08 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san Yep. Trying to get the foundations of a work going w/ a friend & we were having the conversation about characters/archetypes, etc
788396135085932544 2016-10-18 15:07:40 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman lol It's one thing to say "Well, we don't know that it'll be delayed" vs "SHOW ME THE RECEIPTS, PATRICK!!!!!!" Wow

788395083649392640 2016-10-18 15:03:30 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII for me now fuckball depends on the teams/division. Like I'll probably watch A.A. Ron shit the bed Thursday

788391629778456576 2016-10-18 14:49:46 UTC <verygooster> This isn't an anomaly. MNF has been around for 40+ years but trying to cram games 4 of 7 days a week is gonna result in a bad product

785352681082806272 2016-10-09 05:34:04 UTC <verygooster> @JordanRaanan I hope you're okay because that isn't right.https://twitter.com/dduggan21/status/785351367250571264
785333466791612416 2016-10-09 04:17:43 UTC <verygooster> And honestly, we aren't talking Mittens anymore. If somehow you're still "undecided" you're probably a closeted bigot and you can quote me
785333136490164224 2016-10-09 04:16:25 UTC <verygooster> Personally I love the "HE'S ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT" narrative while ignoring he's writing checks anti-gov't people hate seeing lobbyists cashhttps://twitter.com/zackreese/status/785332895145525248
785330005584805888 2016-10-09 04:03:58 UTC <verygooster> He's checking out of a lot more plays and is skittish as all hell lately but hey, I'm not the head coach so \_()_/https://twitter.com/JamesKratch/status/785329804023328768
785324086914326530 2016-10-09 03:40:27 UTC <verygooster> MAYBE CHALLENGE THAT, MCADOO
785322585999413248 2016-10-09 03:34:29 UTC <verygooster> @NESbot_feed like this thread isn't an excuse to say "No Man's Sky" or some shit
785322491552161792 2016-10-09 03:34:07 UTC <verygooster> LMAO OBJ HUGGED THE NET
785316465796911104 2016-10-09 03:10:10 UTC <verygooster> "EVERYTHING IS CORRECTABLE" McAdoo in Week 1, and 2, and 3, etc.https://twitter.com/Patricia_Traina/status/785316221008932864
785315877982011392 2016-10-09 03:07:50 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n Been wondering that about A.A. Ron too. Last season it seemed like more often than not the offense was out of sync
785315625468067846 2016-10-09 03:06:50 UTC <verygooster> And now as you can see, I am in the Acceptance stage of what is probably another 6-10 Giants season despite that FA spending spree
785315403580989440 2016-10-09 03:05:57 UTC <verygooster> ...and it's not just the o-line, Eli has happy feet or not letting plays develop... or McAdoo is being RIDICULOUSLY conservative
785315190954917888 2016-10-09 03:05:06 UTC <verygooster> Now I give the Vikes 100% props for their defense but GB is missing two key DBs against what should be an ace WR corps...and nothing...
785315056233963524 2016-10-09 03:04:34 UTC <verygooster> I FELT something was up when the Giants didn't put up like 80 points on the Saints a month ago.
785314049282215936 2016-10-09 03:00:34 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I also felt like Flowers needed a season to adjust but he just seems bad honestly. Bad hands and footing.
785313964427280384 2016-10-09 03:00:14 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I know he's a rookie but Perkins has been making plays. Understand they want to limit him but also why not at this point.
785312618143748096 2016-10-09 02:54:53 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I have no idea what he did to this offensive playbook if anything, among other factors
785312551261310976 2016-10-09 02:54:37 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I give Todd Bowles a lot of shit but so far it's like having a white Bowles on this team
785311952893579264 2016-10-09 02:52:14 UTC <verygooster> @katienolan first time in like two hours I've laughed. thank you
785311390382821376 2016-10-09 02:50:00 UTC <verygooster> @AutomaticZen It seems like people expect Hillary to literally be Kate McKinnon when she'd rather Trump play himself
785309906421346304 2016-10-09 02:44:06 UTC <verygooster> @PLeonardNYDN will  WILL  W I L L .
785308851490975744 2016-10-09 02:39:55 UTC <verygooster> This defense is getting the job done for a fucking 3rd & 4387328492374589234732 shotgun draw

785304798916710400 2016-10-09 02:23:48 UTC <verygooster> Did everyone in the fucking NFL come together and said OKAY GUYS WERE ALL ABOUT CHECKDOWNS ON THIRD DOWN OKAY? COOL.
785304085566291968 2016-10-09 02:20:58 UTC <verygooster> Yes. Keep feeding the ball to Darkwa who hasnt done a thing tonight.

785301162245382145 2016-10-09 02:09:21 UTC <verygooster> If Hillary was a good senator Will Tye makes that touchdown catch
785301055861055489 2016-10-09 02:08:56 UTC <verygooster> @Sawyer_DAA obviously you didnt play MGS
785299104884723712 2016-10-09 02:01:11 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I am starting to theorize Eli is secretly hurt or something. His accuracy is dipping like crazy.
785298882339151873 2016-10-09 02:00:18 UTC <verygooster> @KSIXI I dont even know what to say. Somehow this team feels worse than last year
785298399482568704 2016-10-09 01:58:23 UTC <verygooster> Elis been lighting it up the last two years. Ive defended the guy the last few years but hes becoming a problem, too
785297746555236353 2016-10-09 01:55:47 UTC <verygooster> MAKE THAT FUCKING CATCH, TYE
785297571824697344 2016-10-09 01:55:05 UTC <verygooster> Yep. Only Hillary had the sole power to change NYs tax code. Thats how that fucking works.

785294872957812737 2016-10-09 01:44:22 UTC <verygooster> Describe Trump in one sentence:  The tests determined THAT was a lie!
785294318990942209 2016-10-09 01:42:10 UTC <verygooster> Im starting to think Eli is actually hurt because he is checking out of plays super fast against a defense missing key guys

785292273407893504 2016-10-09 01:34:02 UTC <verygooster> Maybe Just maybe Its time for Reese to consider a fucking linebacker on this team
785291272424652801 2016-10-09 01:30:04 UTC <verygooster> We brought up the emails. No it hasnt. Its Sunday. No it isnt. You are Donald Trump. No Im not.

785283531824107520 2016-10-09 00:59:18 UTC <verygooster> I must be the only one who REALLY wants this debate to start for my sake
785283461544378368 2016-10-09 00:59:01 UTC <verygooster> Jenkins looks hurt. The defense cant tackle. Offensive is off to a not great start.

785251154162778113 2016-10-09 22:50:39 UTC <verygooster> Again, I legit hope Raiders take the playoff spot (or hey, maybe a first round bye even) that the Bengals have been wasting for years

784187037234626560 2016-10-06 00:22:13 UTC <verygooster> Gears 4 installed. Bring on Tuesday.
784186644152877056 2016-10-06 00:20:40 UTC <verygooster> still might end up seeing it but not sure I'll care about MCU after the Guardians sequel
784184279840460800 2016-10-06 00:11:16 UTC <verygooster> @wlatham92 but yeah Luke Cage is absolutely the more 'real' show
784184104006868993 2016-10-06 00:10:34 UTC <verygooster> @wlatham92 in sorta HK's defense, Harlem is a huge massive community. Hell Kitchen is like six blocks lol

784149733187153921 2016-10-06 21:53:59 UTC <verygooster> @ebenezersamuel Odds the next Hillary/Trump debate is just about Odell for 90 minutes?
784148834557521921 2016-10-06 21:50:25 UTC <verygooster> @setaimx I'm amazed at the people who finish it like the next day. I'm more of a pace myself type of viewer

784095027383377920 2016-10-06 18:16:36 UTC <verygooster> @Valdezology Yep! Had the same issue last year
784094472275628033 2016-10-06 18:14:24 UTC <verygooster> @Valdezology I wish they'd find a way to like refocus the lighting for pics like that ha ha
784093977783988224 2016-10-06 18:12:26 UTC <verygooster> @Valdezology Is that at the same area where the BvS suits were last year?
784093761454366720 2016-10-06 18:11:35 UTC <verygooster> @art_stapleton Man that bye week can't come soon enough for him
784092710370156548 2016-10-06 18:07:24 UTC <verygooster> it's still on until tonight it seems, so cool I will now download Gears of War 4
784088007750090753 2016-10-06 17:48:43 UTC <verygooster> I don't even know who to ask: is that @PayPal @GearsofWar 4 preorder promo still a thing? @Xbox @XboxSupport
784082304520056832 2016-10-06 17:26:03 UTC <verygooster> @shinobi602 I remember when Cliffy B went after Jim Sterling for giving GOW3 an 8/10
784059257050304512 2016-10-06 15:54:28 UTC <verygooster> (i sorta want the Inside Out iOS sticker app)
784020873200148484 2016-10-06 13:21:57 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I'll probably pick back up on it in a week or two but the tail end of S2 lost steam for me
784020719051169792 2016-10-06 13:21:20 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I didn't watch though my initial fear was that it would take them a month to resolve "Flashpoint" but nice that they did it in one

783859997771988992 2016-10-05 02:42:41 UTC <verygooster> The umpire sucks.
783834896204697600 2016-10-05 01:02:56 UTC <verygooster> I don't know what the replay guys were looking at where Span is out. #NLWildCard
783831290298630144 2016-10-05 00:48:37 UTC <verygooster> S1 is not great. Tries too hard to be Mad Men in the 80s. S2 is good but I also don't blame you. Really niche concept.
783828522641088512 2016-10-05 00:37:37 UTC <verygooster> I feel like they got asked to make it more relatable and a lot of S3 touches on like internet security... in 1986
783826627209879552 2016-10-05 00:30:05 UTC <verygooster> Went from "Let's build a PC!" in S1 to "We made eBay and going public!" in like three in-universe years.
783826372334645248 2016-10-05 00:29:04 UTC <verygooster> Halt & Catch Fire had a good season 3 but the technology arc jumps are weird.
783815591798927361 2016-10-05 23:46:14 UTC <verygooster> Omg this Chance KitKat commercial
783775203373506565 2016-10-05 21:05:44 UTC <verygooster> Man I know injuries are common in football but I got like 20 "<x> is out vs <opponent>" and "out for the season" notifications today alone
783765026951798785 2016-10-05 20:25:18 UTC <verygooster> Catching the end of the The Karate Kid: -Johnny spends the match trying to cripple Daniel-san -Johnny loses "HEY LARUSSO YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!"
783740233619832837 2016-10-05 18:46:47 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII Insane is probably more doable on co-op. The AI sucks. You may as well be by yourself.
783732741435162624 2016-10-05 18:17:01 UTC <verygooster> Gears of War Ultimate on Hardcore is not worth the AI headaches
783707929656655872 2016-10-05 16:38:25 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman guessing this is a Stranger Things-like generator but from where?

783654721034813440 2016-10-05 13:06:59 UTC <verygooster> Damn. Jeff can't hang with PSVR
783653332229455872 2016-10-05 13:01:28 UTC <verygooster> @Sawyer_DAA Saw that too. That's Nintendo levels of recommendation
783651572400132097 2016-10-05 12:54:29 UTC <verygooster> You can't escape Bruce Wayne's parents getting murdered even in VR

783508814112952321 2016-10-04 03:27:12 UTC <verygooster> @KennerToys damn these Westworld spoilers
783505853806706688 2016-10-04 03:15:27 UTC <verygooster> Pence speaking better doesn't seem like much of a win. The story is probably going to be his inability to refute anything about Trump.
783502076865282052 2016-10-04 03:00:26 UTC <verygooster> I think I actually want the O's to take this  ...

783493326003724288 2016-10-04 02:25:40 UTC <verygooster> when do I get to hear about America's number one enemy, a one Mr. Ben Ghazi????
783491718570188801 2016-10-04 02:19:16 UTC <verygooster> Ah, I love the "THE MILITARY IS UNDERFUNDED" rhetoric........
783489442015219712 2016-10-04 02:10:14 UTC <verygooster> I discovered I actually like playing that game with the Wiimote (I always look for an excuse to use my Luigi one tho)
783487752386048000 2016-10-04 02:03:31 UTC <verygooster> Almost pulled a muscle trying to do this time trial (using the Wiimote)
783480132329693184 2016-10-04 01:33:14 UTC <verygooster> I fired up DKC Tropical Freeze for the first time in two years maybe and unlocked that first silhouette stage and the music is divine
783474190905139200 2016-10-04 01:09:38 UTC <verygooster> Mike Pence looks like a Bond villain.  And a bigoted pile of shit.
783474121816539137 2016-10-04 01:09:21 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina Yup. Pugh had his number that day.
783458523615207424 2016-10-04 00:07:22 UTC <verygooster> @ByteSizeImp Not talking about the win-loss record. The Odell drama is getting out of hand
783456699290046470 2016-10-04 00:00:07 UTC <verygooster> I was like a pixel away from one of the Bella sisters chainsawing my head off, and the last bullet in the magazine kills her #RE4

783149293163122689 2016-10-03 03:38:36 UTC <verygooster> So is this going to be another season where the Giants might only beat up on bad teams? AFC North is gonna feast at this point.
783146461114593287 2016-10-03 03:27:21 UTC <verygooster> @antitrop love seeing EA's diversity on display!
783142443449520128 2016-10-03 03:11:23 UTC <verygooster> The Giants are ridiculously undisciplined and can't seem to scheme to get their supposed studs open.  But the Vikings defense is l-e-g-i-t.
783132723221262336 2016-10-03 02:32:45 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII Well... I can't pretend I thought we had a chance tonight so
783132572079493121 2016-10-03 02:32:09 UTC <verygooster> Okay. Back to Luke Cage.
783132454773227520 2016-10-03 02:31:41 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII go away
783129696527613953 2016-10-03 02:20:44 UTC <verygooster> Yep. This is a Giants Monday Night Football game.
783128844731551744 2016-10-03 02:17:21 UTC <verygooster> I think OBJ does need to rein it in, but also media reaction to his every little move is pretty ridiculous and he has to play that game ...
783124238647582721 2016-10-03 01:59:02 UTC <verygooster> @KSIXI Yeah it's hard to put it w/o sounding like a homer/tinfoil hat nut but refs definitely looking at him more
783119696249970692 2016-10-03 01:40:59 UTC <verygooster> @StevePoliti What does that make Xavier Rhodes then
783118784030773248 2016-10-03 01:37:22 UTC <verygooster> That WAS a late hit on Odell but he needs to chill

783112205608816640 2016-10-03 01:11:13 UTC <verygooster> @KSIXI I already want to check out by halftime and just continue Luke Cage ...
783112130656632832 2016-10-03 01:10:56 UTC <verygooster> Not that anything is going for the offense but Flowers is killing this line

779104458101915648 2016-09-22 23:45:52 UTC <verygooster> So yeah: I liked S2 of Mr. Robot but didn't love it. Feel like some of the audience toying needs to be reined in a bit for S3.

769606814157733888 2016-08-27 18:45:37 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda the stupid part was the media assuming Cowboys could run away if ROMO COULD STAY HEALTHY, like he was going 16 gms w/o a sack???

769219481176510466 2016-08-26 17:06:30 UTC <verygooster> any time I see a John Oliver clip: *thing in the world that's kinda messed up* *meh hyperbolic comparison joke* *"John Oliver EVISCERATES-"*

768810061720383488 2016-08-25 13:59:37 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 no, it's that I can't just grab a pic from OneDrive and make it Xbox One wallpaper, and that's dumb, had to grab it from a USB
768809581820665856 2016-08-25 13:57:42 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 really
768801584738365444 2016-08-25 13:25:56 UTC <verygooster> so I assumed since OneDrive is a thing I'd ul a pic for X1 wallpaper but... I can't, and need to do it via USB...pic.twitter.com/eC16sU8Ip5

768624240182648832 2016-08-24 01:41:13 UTC <verygooster> Kudos to Doom for not opening with a 20 minute cutscene before you get control of the game
768618628497469440 2016-08-24 01:18:55 UTC <verygooster> @NECA_TOYS @BradleyHail after I saw the new Rick Grimes figure they put out.... Lollllllllll

768545361208147968 2016-08-24 20:27:47 UTC <verygooster> complaining about big patches is a bit tired but damn 18 GB for Doom?  (I THINK it said 18 GB anyway)

768509194467246080 2016-08-24 18:04:04 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda my understanding of it is he wants to be paid his bonus at the end of the season rather than next offseason

743198634091610112 2016-06-15 21:48:56 UTC <verygooster> Has Nintendo said anything about Beat Buy demos or is Zelda just gonna be a Nintendo NY thing?

742768283582124034 2016-06-14 17:18:53 UTC <verygooster> honestly I've become okay with the weapon durability mechanic over the years
742767880647933952 2016-06-14 17:17:17 UTC <verygooster> I'm hoping all that craft and cooking stuff is actually essential to the game and not busywork because I'm a sucker for that micromanagement

735310593549344770 2016-05-24 03:24:41 UTC <verygooster> I know Hollywood just sees games as brands but I wonder what game it would take to fuck up so bad they're like never mind

735224962068426752 2016-05-24 21:44:25 UTC <verygooster> 95% of games journalism will now be Overwatch gifs
735224139401814017 2016-05-24 21:41:09 UTC <verygooster> It seems to be the argument since its drawing less flak vs SF5s launch or something.

733733521039196161 2016-05-20 18:57:58 UTC <verygooster> @AutomaticZen in my last tweet: honestly, I wonder if the veteran actors (Bridges, Redford, Goldblum) find the MCU to be a godsend
733733207217209344 2016-05-20 18:56:43 UTC <verygooster> Maybe aging isn't the word, but 'veteran'
733732998319853568 2016-05-20 18:55:53 UTC <verygooster> Aging (and established) actors must find the MCU to be a godsend
733703248872361985 2016-05-20 16:57:40 UTC <verygooster> @Roto13 like maybe that sounds petty in the long run but it's almost as obnoxious to me as a thread with just bad posts
733703142328705024 2016-05-20 16:57:15 UTC <verygooster> @Roto13 then if it's not the stupid post, then it's the post that DOES offer some rational thought & then everyone is circlejerking that one

733686346099871744 2016-05-20 15:50:30 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR probably aware but that NYCC fan verification thing is going up in like 10 minutes (watch that shit crash)
733676061658124288 2016-05-20 15:09:38 UTC <verygooster> it looks fun and not messy in the way the 2014 movie (and trailers) were.
733675059085234176 2016-05-20 15:05:39 UTC <verygooster> that new TMNT trailer looks pretty fun honestly  but man I hated Michelangelo in that 2014 movie SO MUCH. SO MUCH.

728234626376978433 2016-05-05 14:47:19 UTC <verygooster> Anyway I showed my friend, a teacher, a picture of those Power Ranger suits and all his kids hate it apparently lol
728232896184586240 2016-05-05 14:40:27 UTC <verygooster> but then again after Mighty Morphin I was pretty much done with them so that might have something to do with it
728232529740890112 2016-05-05 14:38:59 UTC <verygooster> Gonna draw flak. Not judging. You do you and all that, but I am honestly a bit surprised anyone over age 10 even cares about Power Rangers.

718528494045655041 2016-04-08 19:58:37 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman  the 'player avatar' thing feels less true with major release in the 3D era. Not a bad thing, but commit to it or don't, Nintendo

718465754304262144 2016-04-08 15:49:18 UTC <verygooster> Though feels like Links become less and less self-inserted character with each major release

714897850426081280 2016-03-29 19:31:44 UTC <verygooster> @Roto13 But honestly like that whole arc with his trial and the aftermath I was legit immersed in. DD/Elektra felt shoehorned.
714897655189618688 2016-03-29 19:30:57 UTC <verygooster> @APowell2099 Elektra was pretty much to being that show's Felicity lol

714600738400432128 2016-03-28 23:51:07 UTC <verygooster> For a show that had Glen Bishop, Ken in an eyepatch, a dude's foot getting shredded, Bob Benson is the weirdest thing about Mad Men to me.

714231157546696705 2016-03-27 23:22:32 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII That goes without saying
714229278322397184 2016-03-27 23:15:04 UTC <verygooster> Eisenberg is awful as Luthor but Topher Grace as Venom just hurts.
714229230251425792 2016-03-27 23:14:52 UTC <verygooster> I found Spider-Man 3 on tv and inevitably asked myself if that was worse than BvS. Ultimately I'd say so.
714217681759703044 2016-03-27 22:28:59 UTC <verygooster> Although I'll come clean and just say a friend and I farmed the "kill 20 rogues" trophy
714217182662639617 2016-03-27 22:27:00 UTC <verygooster> I think I'm like three trophies away from platinum-ing The Division
714210910303289345 2016-03-27 22:02:05 UTC <verygooster> The opening fight of Daredevil S2E11 would be super fun if there wasn't an obnoxious blinking light in the scene

713767024598585344 2016-03-26 16:38:14 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san Yeah it was nice to see one of my favorite characters after *checks naked wrist* 20-30 years or so
713764737520156672 2016-03-26 16:29:09 UTC <verygooster> @hEnereyG in spite of everything I felt about that movie I was legitimately excited to see WW on a movie screen
713556825430487040 2016-03-25 02:42:59 UTC <verygooster> @TheRealAbed godspeed
713515597653520384 2016-03-25 23:59:09 UTC <verygooster> @TheRealAbed Like I wouldn't have known otherwise or assumed in the movie so I dunno wtf Snyder wants me to do with that information
713515482851225601 2016-03-25 23:58:42 UTC <verygooster> @TheRealAbed Oh my GOD. It's like Snyder trying to wink at you and nudging you with his elbow but it's an elbow to face instead.
713515024287940616 2016-03-25 23:56:52 UTC <verygooster> @TheRealAbed Curious if he would have gotten the same material Eisenberg did. Because YEESH

713506287334633472 2016-03-25 23:22:09 UTC <verygooster> @stephensajdak when a Michael Shannon blurb puts more thought into Superman than a 2 and a half hour movie
713502959620001792 2016-03-25 23:08:56 UTC <verygooster> @austin_walker that face when level 60 meme mondays
713493027252269060 2016-03-25 22:29:28 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII Like, Bay's made bad movies, but I feel like he knows what he's making at least and I almost respect that lol.
713492638515769344 2016-03-25 22:27:55 UTC <verygooster> .@Line_XIII Snyder is Bay without the self-awareness
713489649159835648 2016-03-25 22:16:03 UTC <verygooster> @zackreese *sees sex scandal trend* Oh this should be fun
713489498550771712 2016-03-25 22:15:27 UTC <verygooster> @zackreese More like Ted LOSE(r)
713488976422813696 2016-03-25 22:13:22 UTC <verygooster> Zack Snyder is not a storyteller. The guy just likes pasting scenes without any sort of cohesion because they look cool, I guess.
713475718915756036 2016-03-25 21:20:41 UTC <verygooster> @gazele87 For as much as I wasn't into the trailers, I wanted to be proven wrong. Found it bloated and poorly written.
713474344916267008 2016-03-25 21:15:14 UTC <verygooster> Like I'm sure I cracked on it for weeks but I legitimately went in with an 'open mind' or whatever you want to call it. I like Affleck tho.
713474117815705600 2016-03-25 21:14:20 UTC <verygooster> So yeah I did not like most of Batman vs Superman to be honest.
713443976846708736 2016-03-25 19:14:33 UTC <verygooster> Also: "... You took me to see Batman Forever..." @JennaKil

712694582430011392 2016-03-23 17:36:44 UTC <verygooster> The thing I do have concern w/ whatever their gimmick for NX is that it will be squandered the way I felt the game pad possibilities were

709579312291258368 2016-03-14 03:17:46 UTC <verygooster> Yo where the eff is Paul Rhodes?
709547336347820034 2016-03-14 01:10:42 UTC <verygooster> Or World Famous Pizza or World Famous Ray's Pizza or 3 Famous Brothers from Italy Pizza
709547131787419648 2016-03-14 01:09:53 UTC <verygooster> All the pizzerias in The Division seem to be named just Pizzeria or Pizza as opposed to 3 Brothers from Italy or Ray's or something

709370884977516544 2016-03-14 13:29:33 UTC <verygooster> @DoubleUHarrison Somewhere into the second region the entire March Madness bracket leaked and spared us all two hours of commercials

709359055849000961 2016-03-14 12:42:32 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 yeah, like I don't mind loot hunting w people, and the Dark Zone stuff is okay. Might be better when dlc starts hitting
709358477911707648 2016-03-14 12:40:15 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 Basically, but Destiny has nicer looking armor/clothes. It's honestly okay if you're playing alone. Better w/ friends
709357989291909120 2016-03-14 12:38:18 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 I blame The Division lol

709207920441958400 2016-03-13 02:41:59 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR Right show is winning
709204359427596288 2016-03-13 02:27:50 UTC <verygooster> But it's also hilarious how serious this game takes itself a lot of the time.
709204263747121152 2016-03-13 02:27:27 UTC <verygooster> Yet I don't mind the loot hunting and stuff since I've been playing with friends.
709204045437739008 2016-03-13 02:26:35 UTC <verygooster> At lvl 21, The Division so far is another example of Ubisoft capable of designing a world but struggling to do anything meaningful with it.

702304270062919686 2016-02-23 01:29:20 UTC <verygooster> I liked that The Witch was 'straightforward,' to put it a certain way. I'm so used to horror now either subverting/dissecting tropes...

700433152142086144 2016-02-18 21:34:11 UTC <verygooster> And thats fine. Also back in 2003 Nick Nolte was hard to take seriously because of his dumb weird mugshot
700433057317326848 2016-02-18 21:33:48 UTC <verygooster> Also: I think Ang Lees Hulk had some good ideas/concepts in it, but nobody goes to Hulk movies for that.

965399076543004674 2018-02-18 01:34:10 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san But honestly indie labels/IDW/Dark Horse aren't really bad about cataloging from what I've seen too
965398816957566976 2018-02-18 01:33:08 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san DC is a lot better about story arcs than Marvel, I feel. Granted Marvel TPB's will have volume numbers depending on the writer/artist team but I've always found DC arcs far easier to break into

948258521153523712 2018-01-02 18:23:43 UTC <verygooster> @DoubleUHarrison I thought it was a stronger narrative than the first game but yeah it's a shame all the character moments are kind of wayside by ep3 to service the plot which is whatever
948224976561278976 2018-01-02 16:10:26 UTC <verygooster> @WHMPodcast 1) Happy new year, WHM!  2) holy crap I went into this just expecting a knockoff Toy Story/Secret Life of Pets plot which it still sort of is but holy shit is it insane

948044488030801920 2018-01-01 04:13:14 UTC <verygooster> Like amidst the classist and racist stuff (and however Barnum really was IRL) I weirdly appreciate this movie unironically wanting to entertain? In 2017 (well, 2018) -- I mean I've listened to the soundtrack a fair bit today so
948044487196135434 2018-01-01 04:13:14 UTC <verygooster> I keep thinking about The Greatest Showman which I saw yesterday which left me feeling more pensive than necessary but it's a good looking movie and fairly entertaining (dancing bartender!!)

936679460975280136 2017-12-01 19:32:40 UTC <verygooster> Probably not but man Jimmy Fallon somehow makes FICTIONAL nostalgia obnoxious
936679327558782976 2017-12-01 19:32:09 UTC <verygooster> Popstar has a scene where Conner4real goes on Jimmy Fallon who has them do the "Donkey Roll" bit and despite it being a Universal movie I still wonder if that's some hidden dig on Fallon's overreliance on nostalgia

931268067966976002 2017-11-16 21:09:44 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 I could understand that for sure. On the flip side, maybe another good-to-great Batman reboot would finally do it for him at the same time.  Although at this point though also I'm super out of touch at who the hot 30-and-under actors are so \_()_/

930594078860988417 2017-11-14 00:31:32 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 Just feel like if they're gonna build one big universe of characters just don't one-off your villain. Design a larger story arc instead of a singular hero's arc which is what a lot of those movies feel like (I haven't seen Thor Ragnarok though)
930590754958925825 2017-11-14 00:18:20 UTC <verygooster> hot take I feel like what we call "villain problems" in comic movies should probably be called "establishing cinematic universe problems" even if third acts always just devolve into drawn out CGI battles

930116023147286529 2017-11-13 16:51:55 UTC <verygooster> @Kyoufu2011 That's my point. Sonic exists because Sega wanted to look edgy compared to Nintendo and that's it, and everything about Sonic to me has just come off like they didn't think harder beyond that since.
930115105492291584 2017-11-13 16:48:16 UTC <verygooster> The real answer to "What can fix Sonic?" is to go back to 1990-91 and maybe design a character and mechanic that isn't reactionary to an 8-bit plumber you want to show uphttps://www.resetera.com/threads/what-can-fix-sonic.5772/

929857001148108800 2017-11-12 23:42:39 UTC <verygooster> @drewmagary I mean when was the last time a team so blatantly and obviously quit on the coach and it's on display on the field for all to see?
929851800819204096 2017-11-12 23:21:59 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I don't even think McAdoo did anything after the dog pee thing in Philly until Mara stepped in. He's super inconsistent about who he calls out publicly and not. I'm sure that didn't help his case.
929850573595267072 2017-11-12 23:17:07 UTC <verygooster> @ryandisdier When you drop the PS4 controller
929850136485875712 2017-11-12 23:15:22 UTC <verygooster> Why is Janoris even on the field still? He obviously quit. Does this team even HAVE a coach?

923599437317984257 2017-10-26 17:17:20 UTC <verygooster> @GaijinDensetsu On ResetEra, yup. OP wants people to provide or PM from old (GAF) account to prove identity and I can't do that since I pretty much nuked all my credentials there lol.
923598981824942080 2017-10-26 17:15:31 UTC <verygooster> Whoops. One wall I hit nuking my old account. Can't migrate B/S/T feedback over, especially since my ISP ceased providing email service so I can't even get in to try and get a password reset. Oops.
923597573235068928 2017-10-26 17:09:55 UTC <verygooster> @alex_navarro was kind of hoping for like a more ... focused? AC game. Like I'm sure it's fine (I find the series fine overally but it DID need a break) but... sounds like another "wait for a sale" for me.

923562532643713024 2017-10-26 14:50:41 UTC <verygooster> I have mixed feelings tbh. Joe's done plenty to make me tear my hair out but this team overachieved like crazy to get within one game of the World Series. And never a losing season under him either.

919005225633157120 2017-10-13 01:01:34 UTC <verygooster> @eboland11 yeah what was this team thinking getting a player whose strike zone is at like at his ankles
919003968197615616 2017-10-13 00:56:34 UTC <verygooster> on the flip side, you're going to call a ball at the ankles of a 6'7 player a strike? Okay!
919003525136470017 2017-10-13 00:54:49 UTC <verygooster> Low ball and a Gardner check swing and you're booing? Okay!
918974483419009025 2017-10-13 22:59:25 UTC <verygooster> Criticizing Eli (for that delay of game) was never the issue, but that he would refuse to call ANY OTHER PLAYER out for their poor play, especially a certain left tackle and first-round cornerback

917097797505159169 2017-10-08 18:42:08 UTC <verygooster> "Saw some good things out there." -Ben McAdoo on a 9-10 Giants loss against the 1-4 Chargers
917095889881223171 2017-10-08 18:34:33 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n Only touchdown scored by the RB, who then got taken out of the rotation by McAdoo
917095536439758849 2017-10-08 18:33:09 UTC <verygooster> @ryandisdier The Giants somehow made "an 0-4 team PLAYING DOWN to an 0-4 team" possible. Bravo
917093069576687617 2017-10-08 18:23:21 UTC <verygooster> by the way @VP @realDonaldTrump the two of you and all your cronies and your sheep and bots can spare me trying to shift this whole anthem narrative to the military. You shit on them practically daily anyway.

915694233792729094 2017-10-04 21:44:52 UTC <verygooster> So even if you have Starz as part of your TV package some movies are locked out unless you shell out more for the streaming sub which is such a load of horse shithttps://twitter.com/verygooster/status/915678497082880000

915689461433937925 2017-10-04 21:25:54 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII I actually didn't mind him calling Eli out for that delay of game vs Detroit but it's not a good look to easily call your QB out but not call out your O-line for shit play or your WRs for drops either, etc.

912062020563996673 2017-09-24 21:11:45 UTC <verygooster> @EthanGSN Like no coach's film breakdown of the final minute or the miss tackling changes that he left an entire touchdown on the board. Ben sucks
912061885125709824 2017-09-24 21:11:13 UTC <verygooster> @EthanGSN Last week he kept the offense from attempting a endof 1st-half drive. This week he leaves an entire touchdown on the board to puff his chest
912059847654428673 2017-09-24 21:03:07 UTC <verygooster> I just can't get over that.
912059818558545921 2017-09-24 21:03:00 UTC <verygooster> Sorry. No breakdown of the mistakes and penalties and "what's a catch" isn't going to change that the coach gave away 6 points.
912059391112826881 2017-09-24 21:01:18 UTC <verygooster> @Giants McAdoo gave away 6 points.

912051615787552768 2017-09-24 20:30:24 UTC <verygooster> Wow if only an arrogant coach hadn't puffed his chest out and hadn't left 6 points on the board

909992592548524037 2017-09-18 04:08:35 UTC <verygooster> Find someone who protects your QB the way Ereck Flowers protects his Twitter account #NYG #NYGiantspic.twitter.com/NmrQXGLEVN
909990768462442496 2017-09-18 04:01:20 UTC <verygooster> @bigblueview This is a bad team and this season will very well be over by next week. May as well scotch tape the Titanic.
909986409599074305 2017-09-18 03:44:01 UTC <verygooster> No sense of urgency and Eli is trying not to die which is why he took the Captain Checkdown cap from Alex Smith
909986074809831424 2017-09-18 03:42:41 UTC <verygooster> it's funny given how much he went for it on 4th down last year, but that final minute in 1st half was HOT GARBAGE & then just runs down 2TDs
909985929774776320 2017-09-18 03:42:07 UTC <verygooster> I understand McAdoo has to coach around his offense's deficiencies (woof) and protect his QB but I can't stand how scared he coaches
909983103183147009 2017-09-18 03:30:53 UTC <verygooster> @NJDevils Let's play some awesome hockey this year!

909968819774476289 2017-09-18 02:34:07 UTC <verygooster> @bigblueview good luck to the beat writers talking this fanbase off the ledge
909967801221337088 2017-09-18 02:30:04 UTC <verygooster> WHY is McAdoo going back to Perkins when Darkwa's had the better game????????????? DARKWA would probably have SCORED.

909962227708579841 2017-09-18 02:07:56 UTC <verygooster> Orleans Darkwa for like what, 4-5 yards?  Okay see you in the 4th quarter!
909958450851061760 2017-09-18 01:52:55 UTC <verygooster> McAdoo is such a coward my god
909957183172902912 2017-09-18 01:47:53 UTC <verygooster> I hope Ereck Flowers does a better job blocking me on Twitter than he does in this game because it's time to move on from him
909946353710698496 2017-09-18 01:04:51 UTC <verygooster> the giants moved the football  across the field  and scored points  what sorcery is this
909945595787431936 2017-09-18 01:01:50 UTC <verygooster> Real talk I'm more happy that the defense is getting a rest than the offense actually doing anything

909936689413582848 2017-09-18 00:26:27 UTC <verygooster> Hey let's not embarrass ourselves in front of that 2007 team maybe????

875723990639288322 2017-06-16 14:37:24 UTC <verygooster> @NECA_TOYS Have you read about Konami actually blackballing ex-employees and apparently they're not allowed to put them on their rsum? Pretty crazy.
875715502466846720 2017-06-16 14:03:40 UTC <verygooster> @IOInteractive Congrats and best of luck to the team. Hitman is just fantastic
875704659461242880 2017-06-16 13:20:35 UTC <verygooster> @TomHolland1996 @NY_Comic_Con I wish Bruce Campbell as Mysterio had happened in the Raimi era
875531141238984704 2017-06-15 01:51:05 UTC <verygooster> @giantbomb conserve that energy for more dabbing
875528968413339650 2017-06-15 01:42:27 UTC <verygooster> @pinstripealley Got something in the mail todaypic.twitter.com/Qw6DYjhjlE
875501542647975936 2017-06-15 23:53:28 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 and he was already eating shit this morning for a quote that amounted to "Yeah we announced Scalebound too early"
875500152357826560 2017-06-15 23:47:56 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 I get it in general and maybe that's in a way out of his hands, but they can't continue NOT having a solution months later
875499386612178945 2017-06-15 23:44:54 UTC <verygooster> This is ridiculously frustrating. Backing up and/or transferring saves shouldn't require the same PR answer you give about Mother 3.pic.twitter.com/oftNKhih6o
875494787910074368 2017-06-15 23:26:38 UTC <verygooster> Also I have to finally play Metro: Last Light...
875494181606760448 2017-06-15 23:24:13 UTC <verygooster> "Honorable mention" is The Evil Within 2. I wasn't 100% on the first game but I was into it enough that I'll play part two for sure.
875493353885978624 2017-06-15 23:20:56 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 The power of X-COM

875478666356117505 2017-06-15 22:22:34 UTC <verygooster> Someone should tell David Cage his game is inherently political whether that's his intention or not
875441256788373504 2017-06-15 19:53:55 UTC <verygooster> @brOrayn I remember demoing Mario 3D World and got cat ears and now I feel I'm due a Cappy
875431447011708928 2017-06-15 19:14:56 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR ah I caught Bad Moms on cable the other day and I dug it
875430872597622784 2017-06-15 19:12:39 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR movies or shows? (or both?)
875427952275709952 2017-06-15 19:01:03 UTC <verygooster> @LeeGoldbergABC7 I can live with this
875419297451057153 2017-06-15 18:26:39 UTC <verygooster> @bobservo must be parade day

875406597647937536 2017-06-15 17:36:11 UTC <verygooster> @Kyoufu2011 actually a little surprised their Spotlight video didn't briefly go on about a big OS update or something
875406225361469441 2017-06-15 17:34:43 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR Really want to try and make it there Saturday
875405648602832899 2017-06-15 17:32:25 UTC <verygooster> I wonder what the odds are Nintendo gets video sharing out in time for Mario Odyssey
875162427666595841 2017-06-14 01:25:57 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 If it's coming to Netflix then probably when it's closer to the S2 premiere , but I don't have Netflix 
875161128359297024 2017-06-14 01:20:47 UTC <verygooster> @theanderson64 Let me catch up on your damned show, NBC!!!
875160317344481282 2017-06-14 01:17:34 UTC <verygooster> "I guess I'll make Timeless my next binge." *only the pilot and episodes 12-15 are on @hulu* I mean NBC DID renew that show, yes?

875126460771708929 2017-06-14 23:03:01 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 Kojima is giving good answers but man these questions lol.
875126257272410113 2017-06-14 23:02:13 UTC <verygooster> @jasonschreier Ron Howard narration: "And then all those games were delayed."
875124769078861828 2017-06-14 22:56:18 UTC <verygooster> If people are digging that Kojima event cool but all I took away from that so far was:  "Mr. Kojima, are awesome are movies?" "So awesome."
875120716911345664 2017-06-14 22:40:12 UTC <verygooster> @mattzollerseitz Matthew Rhys Keri Russell

875058649399533568 2017-06-14 18:33:34 UTC <verygooster> Magneto is the Malcolm Merlyn of X-Men movies
875039294368428033 2017-06-14 17:16:39 UTC <verygooster> Very cool of @giantbomb to get @Janina on and shoot the breeze and talk Star Wars yesterday
875015527852331015 2017-06-14 15:42:13 UTC <verygooster> @Roto13 They opened it to the public, but apparently did not organize to actually accommodate the extra turnout between public and press
874989386903019524 2017-06-14 13:58:21 UTC <verygooster> Well we're out of that gross heat (for now) so maybe a trip is in order https://twitter.com/NintendoNYC/status/874985342235025408

874748814061654016 2017-06-13 22:02:23 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII Yeah Trump's the guy I turn to about athleticism
874747921417351172 2017-06-13 21:58:51 UTC <verygooster> @pacman326 I was wrong. DQ7 is on sale but yeah it's an E3 sale. http://e3.nintendo.com/sale
874744079225147392 2017-06-13 21:43:35 UTC <verygooster> I lost my copy of Super Mario Galaxy ages ago so good time to remedy that I guess https://e3.nintendo.com/sale/
874743814031900672 2017-06-13 21:42:31 UTC <verygooster> @setaimx ...  you are correct  but because this is the internet, you are WRONG
874743037599113216 2017-06-13 21:39:26 UTC <verygooster> Bought Dragon Quest 8 3DS full price and it goes on sale a week later lol, digitally too
874741143069708289 2017-06-13 21:31:55 UTC <verygooster> I am one of those "I don't care for SUnshine" people but damn if that game didn't have such a fun trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4GKpejYNkchttps://twitter.com/werifes/status/874740472857542656
874740740290641922 2017-06-13 21:30:19 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR Likely going digital for Mario Odyssey, maybe Rabbids Xenoblade... depends on the file size I guess
874740311226032130 2017-06-13 21:28:36 UTC <verygooster> @abyssviola Wasn't in the Spotlight video: 3DS remake of Metroid 2  Mercury Steam
874740073094414336 2017-06-13 21:27:39 UTC <verygooster> @abyssviola actually  2 metroid games got announced

874719679822090240 2017-06-13 20:06:37 UTC <verygooster> probably shouldn't be surprised the company that can't or won't work out the logistics of changing your username won't sign off on crossplay
874713507417255936 2017-06-13 19:42:06 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I REALLY wanted to like Dream Team, but yeah
874713390417149952 2017-06-13 19:41:38 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR Apparently they didn't even change anything around to accommodate for the extra (public) people
874692037760647169 2017-06-13 18:16:47 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I do start to wonder if all those other Mario outfits in Odyssey eventually get amiibo

874680632986787841 2017-06-13 17:31:28 UTC <verygooster> @BombosMedallion That was my takeaway
874680242941636608 2017-06-13 17:29:55 UTC <verygooster> @johntv Super Metroid composer I think I read ?
874676071878328321 2017-06-13 17:13:20 UTC <verygooster> "Why didn't they show this in the Spotlight?" What difference does 45 minutes make?
874674415363117056 2017-06-13 17:06:45 UTC <verygooster> @DanRyckert sombrero and poncho  i need nothing else

874665697216954370 2017-06-13 16:32:07 UTC <verygooster> Always figured Mario would stay in 2017 but didn't expect October tbh. And props to them for sticking to 2017 w/ the next Xenoblade
874664783009771522 2017-06-13 16:28:29 UTC <verygooster> I already see "No VC or Mother 3 is a huge bummer" posts on GAF and can't tell if that's sarcasm or not at this point
874663750330191877 2017-06-13 16:24:23 UTC <verygooster> Uh Nintendo I'm gonna need sombrero and poncho Mario amiibo k thx
874658556540317696 2017-06-13 16:03:44 UTC <verygooster> Reggie's opening statement reminds me of the opening narration for Run Lola Run
874657941974122497 2017-06-13 16:01:18 UTC <verygooster> Nintendo stole all of Need for Speed's actors
874655934970306565 2017-06-13 15:53:19 UTC <verygooster> Less than 10 minutes on Nintendo E3  Less than 40 before "Where was Retro?? It was mostly Mario! LET 3DS DIE ALREADY"
874649696693833728 2017-06-13 15:28:32 UTC <verygooster> @BombosMedallion real talk I gag when I read someone unironically saying "<company> stopped innovating"

874636335117684736 2017-06-13 14:35:26 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I wish more official game shirts were like this instead of, "we splattered the main character and here's the game's logo!"

874634213936558081 2017-06-13 14:27:01 UTC <verygooster> @jbouie one takeaway from that first movie for me also is how ridiculously perfect Willem Dafoe and James Franco are casted as father and son
874630316845133824 2017-06-13 14:11:32 UTC <verygooster> @daswhalebeard less than 2 hours
874630004721799168 2017-06-13 14:10:17 UTC <verygooster> @jbouie Action parts of the 1st movie don't hold up for me (except that surprisingly brutal last fight) but think the emotional story is still great

874389974174638081 2017-06-12 22:16:29 UTC <verygooster> I played AC Unity and Syndicate, but somehow still don't know or get the endgame of that series' overall narrative arc if there is one

874372682434969600 2017-06-12 21:07:47 UTC <verygooster> Yup. Beyond Good & Evil 2. It's actually real.

874082305077280768 2017-06-11 01:53:55 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII Apparently the lead dev and/or writer of The Last Night, one of the games shown at MS E3, is a g4m3rg4t3r and the game's story reflects this
874081185416323073 2017-06-11 01:49:28 UTC <verygooster> @Kyoufu2011 I say "Eh-nix" and I'm fairly certain they say it that way in their ads for games
874078787616604160 2017-06-11 01:39:57 UTC <verygooster> I would almost respect someone if they just said "This thing is not something I want to think about" instead of pretending to take a stand
874078611225096193 2017-06-11 01:39:15 UTC <verygooster> "I can separate the art from the artist" as used today, to me anyway, is just a roundabout way of just saying "I don't give a shit"https://twitter.com/XEECEEVEVO/status/874072388547125248

873638614990802945 2017-06-10 20:30:51 UTC <verygooster> @DoubleUHarrison I actually think you kind of nailed it indirectly: I'd probably would rather just fire up Overwatch.

834778535390765060 2017-02-23 14:54:46 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda it's impressive that they couldn't even get a dedicated retro plug-and-play device right (in terms of availability anyway)
834777543295303680 2017-02-23 14:50:50 UTC <verygooster> @dasme especially given NES Classic availability problems
834776637258469376 2017-02-23 14:47:14 UTC <verygooster> @dasme kinda wonder how they approach it then if they heard/took Wii U VC criticisms to heart
834776406517231616 2017-02-23 14:46:19 UTC <verygooster> so no VC at Switch launch, but if there was it'd probably be like SMB, Balloon Fight, Ice Climbers, Metroid, and that's it

828592652752973825 2017-02-06 13:14:17 UTC <verygooster> Baffling. Letting Brady score in every possession in from the 3rd qtr on sure didn't help, but dunno how you botch this drive so badly.https://twitter.com/KNegandhiESPN/status/828586867545272320

820410973542580224 2017-01-14 23:23:13 UTC <verygooster> @johntv I hope they put the effort into VC stuff that the NES games in the Classic Mini got
820410283957112832 2017-01-14 23:20:28 UTC <verygooster> @jasonschreier wonder how much Zelda at launch helps the really sparse launch day lineup along with no 'Wii' brand confusion this time
820404610959638529 2017-01-14 22:57:56 UTC <verygooster> Seahawks playing like they just saw the Switch launch lineup
820397017906184192 2017-01-14 22:27:45 UTC <verygooster> I mean probably not but goddamn that Hester run was nice
820396945365725185 2017-01-14 22:27:28 UTC <verygooster> I am sick of fucking sick ass KOR/punt returns called back for illegal block or god knows what else... has to happen like 75% of the time
820395745161474057 2017-01-14 22:22:42 UTC <verygooster> How does Russell miss basketball there
820392494932357121 2017-01-14 22:09:47 UTC <verygooster> Devin Hester. In 2017.
820391804344406016 2017-01-14 22:07:02 UTC <verygooster> Am absolutely loving Blood & Wine. Just any excuse to keep playing The Witcher 3, really. @witchergame @CDPROJEKTRED
820310879539490816 2017-01-14 16:45:28 UTC <verygooster> @Phazon4G ah I see. Amazon US has micro SD cards on sale all the damn time so not an issue for me either way
820310173659099137 2017-01-14 16:42:40 UTC <verygooster> @Phazon4G is it only Micro SD or can switch use an external HDD also?
820110878800576512 2017-01-13 03:30:45 UTC <verygooster> It makes me so happy that @VinnyCaravella calls the 2nd base boss in Contra "Optimus Prime" because I've been doing that for like 25 years
820072954428096513 2017-01-13 01:00:03 UTC <verygooster> the chip on debit cards now is ruining my life
820058504992092164 2017-01-13 00:02:38 UTC <verygooster> Too bad the show got too into the Rambaldi stuff as it went on. Could blame Abrams but he left at some point I think
820057994402664448 2017-01-13 00:00:36 UTC <verygooster> Every episode in season one recaps the show's premise and then there's an entire episode that does the same thing lol
820057784729399298 2017-01-13 23:59:46 UTC <verygooster> So a few weeks back I decided of all shows to binge Alias, which I haven't watched in maybe a decade

820007381711147008 2017-01-13 20:39:29 UTC <verygooster> I wonder if down the road there's a Switch SKU with Mario and Luigi color schemed JoyCons
820004336818388998 2017-01-13 20:27:23 UTC <verygooster> @ArcadeGirl64 Yeah I saw that year 1 lineup image but XC2 w a generic "2017" made me think this
819994537061916672 2017-01-13 19:48:27 UTC <verygooster> @jasonschreier No this is the guy she told you not to worry abouthttp://imgur.com/ovGYedx
819994082676264960 2017-01-13 19:46:38 UTC <verygooster> Also seems like Amazon, Walmart, Target, are sold out (for now) but GameStop still has the gray JoyCon Switch set
819993632707121152 2017-01-13 19:44:51 UTC <verygooster> I think I'm looking forward to Giant Bomb's Switch launch stream more than the actual Switch launch

819926799375331331 2017-01-13 15:19:17 UTC <verygooster> @Phazon4G I thought that too!! lol
819923582289637380 2017-01-13 15:06:30 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman followed by like a "Why aren't you playing ARMS?" thinkpiece
819922258433110017 2017-01-13 15:01:14 UTC <verygooster> @patrickklepek I stayed away from Best Buy because they overcharged my card to check if I had funds on my Wii U preorder & they cancelled it
819913605021859840 2017-01-13 14:26:51 UTC <verygooster> Not at all surprised Nintendo's stock dropped. Splatoon 2 isn't on a mobile phone and they're not charging $10 for different ink colors.
819913190343667712 2017-01-13 14:25:12 UTC <verygooster> @BombosMedallion the Nintendo site has a YouTube video window embedded
819912710674587648 2017-01-13 14:23:18 UTC <verygooster> @HaroldLi Me last night: "Mario at holiday? maybe I'll wait." This morning: "Zelda at launch. screw it I'm gonna own one anyway *preorder*"
819895028973707265 2017-01-13 13:13:02 UTC <verygooster> I'm always amused when NeoGAF builds themselves up for a Nintendo event and it's almost always a disappointment

817911590108467201 2017-01-07 01:51:33 UTC <verygooster> is there ever a day of the week where there ISN'T a water main break in Jersey Cityhttps://twitter.com/JC_Gov/status/817911461733404673

817891498880565248 2017-01-07 00:31:43 UTC <verygooster> In spite of some snow shoveling and (half assed) house cleaning, pretty much spent most of today playing The Witcher 3: Blood & Wine

816665140259078144 2017-01-04 15:18:36 UTC <verygooster> Most people talk about the Cup Noodles stuff in FF XV but I'm taken aback by the random Coleman branding

816368694301495297 2017-01-03 19:40:38 UTC <verygooster> I thought the Colorado episode of Hitman would pose a problem yet somehow managed to kill 3/4 targets in a two-minute span
816111140552015873 2017-01-02 02:37:13 UTC <verygooster> I like when I reply to 18h old tweet because I don't catch the "in case you missed it" right away because Twitter is dumb
816110738674765824 2017-01-02 02:35:37 UTC <verygooster> Amazon did that with Star Trek and I was slightly annoyed. Basically 1 through 6 but not part 4

815979906052001792 2017-01-02 17:55:44 UTC <verygooster> It hasn't differentiated itself from other Ueda titles really even if it has nice moments here and there. Nvm how much I fight w the game
815979328840302592 2017-01-02 17:53:26 UTC <verygooster> TLG so conflicting. For a game that took almost a decade, it's actually mundane and frustrating to play most of the time.

811670427504361476 2016-12-21 20:31:24 UTC <verygooster> No matter how you feel about 2016, at least it gave us the Shenmue Endurance Run @alex_navarro @VinnyCaravella @DanRyckert
811605034777636864 2016-12-21 16:11:33 UTC <verygooster> I really like it. I was hooked exploring areas. Feels like 2D Zelda/80s Apple II game or something

811354313557737476 2016-12-20 23:35:17 UTC <verygooster> also lord this game pulls plot points out of its ass
811353062845448192 2016-12-20 23:30:19 UTC <verygooster> @ZeoMassicot story-wise I get it but good LORD what were they thinking
811352780027920388 2016-12-20 23:29:11 UTC <verygooster> @ZeoMassicot is that when the city is on lockdown and you have to avoid every fucking cop to get anywhere?
811352345342836736 2016-12-20 23:27:27 UTC <verygooster> Finished Deus Ex: Mankind Divided finally. Enjoyed half of it, found the other half tedious, [ending scene missing]
811351741916712960 2016-12-20 23:25:04 UTC <verygooster> @Deadspin lol "Bob McAdoo"
811297615119683584 2016-12-20 19:49:59 UTC <verygooster> @brOrayn when do us straights get representation??
811258745355378688 2016-12-20 17:15:32 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR you just made the list
811258422989570049 2016-12-20 17:14:15 UTC <verygooster> At the post office. Again.  The line is long. Again.  Doing a return. Again.
811233773467615233 2016-12-20 15:36:18 UTC <verygooster> @alex_navarro my theater does a discount Tuesday kinda thing and I still might go ...
811182416278814720 2016-12-20 12:12:13 UTC <verygooster> @WHMPodcast BvS hands down: Nick Nolte, Holly Hunter, and Steve exploding at how stupid the "Martha" scene was
811070751893815296 2016-12-19 04:48:30 UTC <verygooster> @KSIXI on the same running play twice even. Yeesh

811065910660370432 2016-12-19 04:29:16 UTC <verygooster> @alex_navarro looking on IMDb how did that series not get like 8 million direct to Netflix releases
811061609267429376 2016-12-19 04:12:11 UTC <verygooster> @miDnIghtEr20C the Redskins got a bad PI call but the ref changed his mind lol
811060950879129600 2016-12-19 04:09:34 UTC <verygooster> Weak ass DPI call
811055763120590848 2016-12-19 03:48:57 UTC <verygooster> Some of these Toad rallies can eat shit
811045903628992512 2016-12-19 03:09:46 UTC <verygooster> @NYGDaily I'm guessing you were watching that dumb First Take clip too
811044110924713984 2016-12-19 03:02:39 UTC <verygooster> @miDnIghtEr20C I'm just tired of refs being garbage especially this year and the VP of officiating just sits there with his eyes closed
811042277011456004 2016-12-19 02:55:21 UTC <verygooster> @miDnIghtEr20C I get upset when the refs suck. Cam getting a flag doesn't mean that hit to the head shouldn't be called.
811041386640371714 2016-12-19 02:51:49 UTC <verygooster> This sounds reactionary because of that Cam non-call but maybe a competent person should have Dean Blandino's job
811035711428329473 2016-12-19 02:29:16 UTC <verygooster> @art_stapleton Refs are just straight messing with Cam at that point
811035356237885440 2016-12-19 02:27:51 UTC <verygooster> lmao nope
811035237157404676 2016-12-19 02:27:23 UTC <verygooster> CAM GOT A CALL IN 2016

810901509160443904 2016-12-19 17:36:00 UTC <verygooster> @MLBGeo I'm actually pretty patient with lines so I'm good. One of the few things I'm patient about at all lol
810900134326398977 2016-12-19 17:30:32 UTC <verygooster> Returning that duplicate copy of Deus Ex MD I got after all the insane mailing adventure during thanksgiving/Black Friday

810872685685342208 2016-12-19 15:41:28 UTC <verygooster> @ByteSizeImp apparently the Suicide Squad project is cancelled and WB Montreal is focusing on that Batman game now
810866256853213184 2016-12-19 15:15:55 UTC <verygooster> My favorite actual reaction to another Batman game: "Day 1 on PC!!" because that went well the last time...
810712159114108932 2016-12-18 05:03:35 UTC <verygooster> Some of Mario Run's little animations here and there mess with how I'm "trained" to react to Super Mario Bros. so I end up frustrated a bit

810697714342182912 2016-12-18 04:06:11 UTC <verygooster> @gazele87 hopefully they learn from that first Battlefront launch
810696793864491009 2016-12-18 04:02:32 UTC <verygooster> One thing about Rogue One: it made me want a Frostbite Dark Forces/Republic Commando-type game so badhttps://twitter.com/gamespot/status/810696232914055168
810690853505208324 2016-12-18 03:38:56 UTC <verygooster> It's fascinating when coaches/coordinators veer away from what works to get cute on playcalling

810617631661297665 2016-12-18 22:47:58 UTC <verygooster> No one needs a movie about it when everyone saw it unfold over social media
810617560995688449 2016-12-18 22:47:41 UTC <verygooster> Making a movie out of the Boston Marathon bombing seems like an old person executive greenlight

810601381434454016 2016-12-18 21:43:24 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd I think my favorite thing about this season besides potential playoffs is MetLife is ACTUALLY loud and I HEAR IT ON TELEVISION
810599394303217664 2016-12-18 21:35:30 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd Just about. Dude checks down so much and I don't blame him partly but Lions' best CB out vs OBJ. Make plays, man!

810566806331162625 2016-12-18 19:26:00 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR That was my reaction when I finally watched it. Knew very little going into it
810566322237165568 2016-12-18 19:24:05 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n Meanwhile holy crap it's like no one told Minny they still have a shot at the postseason

809757693670031360 2016-12-16 13:50:53 UTC <verygooster> @BombosMedallion That's so weird. My right earbud died last night. Clearly we are long lost brothers and they're a secret talisman
809756933150412804 2016-12-16 13:47:52 UTC <verygooster> I don't think I've ever entered a Nintendo-centric thread in which Spieler Eins wasn't completely taking a dump on them in some capacityhttps://twitter.com/NESbot_feed/status/809750213820895232
809615824700981248 2016-12-15 04:27:09 UTC <verygooster> Is anyone gonna even talk about the Seahawks using a fake up three scores?

809566221880401920 2016-12-15 01:10:02 UTC <verygooster> Jeff Fisher only seemed to ever game plan against the NFC West. Maybe should have waited until after this game (or the season) to fire him

809443098300391424 2016-12-15 17:00:48 UTC <verygooster> @BombosMedallion that's my understanding, for 'productivity' stuff. Dunno what Mini 2 is like power-wise but that's the cheapest iPad new

809213815158149120 2016-12-14 01:49:42 UTC <verygooster> I couldn't get the ragdoll physics body through the final door for some reason and I ended up killing him in the process. I was DYING
809213685801635842 2016-12-14 01:49:11 UTC <verygooster> I did this well enough. No one saw me, took him the same way I came in...

808162262582226945 2016-12-11 04:11:12 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd Someone should tell him he's overrelying on them at this point. It's AMAZING they aren't gassed at this point.
808161078433763330 2016-12-11 04:06:30 UTC <verygooster> Ben  This game is not over  Another score might help  Maybe coach for another score I dunno

808159006913073152 2016-12-11 03:58:16 UTC <verygooster> And Cruz wanted the ball more

808150310850101252 2016-12-11 03:23:43 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd I'm less watching as a Giants fan and more watching out of scientific curiosity: like how will the offense fuck up next?
808148095208984576 2016-12-11 03:14:55 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina Al and Cris: "You may as well take a knee in the end zone on every return"
808143723502641152 2016-12-11 02:57:32 UTC <verygooster> Imagine if the offense was good  Giants could be up 21-7, or 10-7, or 14-7  but no  because 2016 will not allow this
808143304374321152 2016-12-11 02:55:52 UTC <verygooster> Dan Bailey misses a FG. We officially have entered  FUCKBALL!!!!!!!

808136342441955329 2016-12-11 02:28:13 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina It's never just that the opponent outplays, it's that they don't even have to try when the Giants take the ball.
808136255007522817 2016-12-11 02:27:52 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina Giants losing isn't even what annoys me. It's that they're so consistent in shooting themselves in the foot.

805814530047692800 2016-12-05 16:42:09 UTC <verygooster> Yeah, I've put up with minor quirks here on games I like and there but when stuff like terrible fps and terrible camera and misc jank, eh
805814266330828800 2016-12-05 16:41:07 UTC <verygooster> --but there's a disappointment when I read "this game has a fuckton of performance issues but I liked it so I didn't care"

803619359205642240 2016-11-29 15:19:20 UTC <verygooster> When there have been plenty of good Superman stories out there to check out
803619279388090369 2016-11-29 15:19:01 UTC <verygooster> And though I'm not the hugest Superman guy I do take slight umbrage at the lazy "he's near-invulernable = boring"
803619079500091392 2016-11-29 15:18:13 UTC <verygooster> Good read. The writer seems to appreciate Superman's empathy which would arguably need to be core to the game design.
803617133317894144 2016-11-29 15:10:29 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san Saving people as a side objective would get boring fast. Setting it in metropolis would get boring (to me anyway).
803617028221173761 2016-11-29 15:10:04 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san Like MAYBE a good Superman game can happen? But agree conceptually: shouldn't simply be open-world/side objective game.

803037297419485184 2016-11-27 00:46:26 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd which sounds very "DUH" when you read it that way but it's disappointing
803037231405371392 2016-11-27 00:46:10 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd With the D being as bad as it was last year McAdoo cranked it up but now that they're bailing us out he's okay w/ the calling
803037081694076928 2016-11-27 00:45:34 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd read an interesting take on the NYG subreddit of all places:
803035822735970305 2016-11-27 00:40:34 UTC <verygooster> I mean imagine if the offense didn't make me want to pull my teeth out
803035512449728512 2016-11-27 00:39:20 UTC <verygooster> Somehow  Some way  Miraculously  The Giants are 2nd in the NFC

802967295140052992 2016-11-27 20:08:16 UTC <verygooster> I hate watching this offense like 78% of the time
802960788591808513 2016-11-27 19:42:24 UTC <verygooster> Are we gonna talk about how the Giants let Josh McCown convert on 2nd & 30pic.twitter.com/ZLwGGPh6ta

802949101604245505 2016-11-27 18:55:58 UTC <verygooster> I'm just gonna assume the horrible opening drives is McAdoo letting opposing defenses' guard down

802943105662091264 2016-11-27 18:32:09 UTC <verygooster> Apparently you can overlook because that was the 3rd or 4th three-and-out.
802942931481067521 2016-11-27 18:31:27 UTC <verygooster> This is why I can't stand all the narratives before these games: "We can't overlook the other team." "We can't take their record lightly."
802941634858074116 2016-11-27 18:26:18 UTC <verygooster> can't tell on Twitter if that's coffee or chili
802940942802042880 2016-11-27 18:23:33 UTC <verygooster> I notice from writers more often than not that portrayal of something = condoning the action rather than break it down
802940260846043136 2016-11-27 18:20:50 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda i dunno i'm sure I've used it at least 20 times lol

802134945783316482 2016-11-25 13:00:48 UTC <verygooster> or I guess $35+ games will discount to GCU but not the $29.99 titles Best Buy has listed

796917995465560064 2016-11-10 03:30:30 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR The crazy part is that I'm fairly certain it was either number one for the weekend or did decent $ because of the Episode I trailer
796915834153213952 2016-11-10 03:21:55 UTC <verygooster> @miDnIghtEr20C I did. Bill even said not to ignore them or Wisconsin.

796887578473594880 2016-11-10 01:29:38 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda a deal they struck earlier in the year because NBC wanted dat money

796849240765059072 2016-11-10 22:57:18 UTC <verygooster> SOON (amusingly I just got IW in the mail)
796849031041449984 2016-11-10 22:56:28 UTC <verygooster> Too many. It's easy to think of solely the memorable classics but I'd have played ANYTHING in the NES's heyday https://twitter.com/ArcadeGirl64/status/796797277591535616
796841886384320512 2016-11-10 22:28:04 UTC <verygooster> @setaimx @sedoster Seems like the major retailers are your best bet as far as units coming in. Keep hearing low numbers for GameStop
796840988073410561 2016-11-10 22:24:30 UTC <verygooster> @setaimx I'm not that picky on retro emulation but playing SMB3 on this thing vs on Wii U VC is goddamned NIGHT AND DAY for me

796831510796128256 2016-11-10 21:46:51 UTC <verygooster> Better than the 18 I kept hearing (though that was GameStop)

796402808106979328 2016-11-09 17:23:20 UTC <verygooster> @gazele87 it's like this fine line of "fuck you" and "I get it though" from their perspective anyway. Hard to put it w/o enabling it lol

796337353614888961 2016-11-09 13:03:14 UTC <verygooster> That just... sums up the last 12 hours
796337244869160960 2016-11-09 13:02:49 UTC <verygooster> When Coach finds out that's not the case, Kyle Chandler gives the most epic, low-key "Damn, Julie. Damn..."
796337104125038593 2016-11-09 13:02:15 UTC <verygooster> There's a FNL episode where Julie is super drunk and Tim Riggins brings her home and Coach thinks he's taking advantage of her

790363214274068481 2016-10-23 01:24:09 UTC <verygooster> Super fucking lame but not surprised because this show has no spine

790361854325448704 2016-10-23 01:18:44 UTC <verygooster> He said it like 50 times during that part. Shit's gonna be in my nightmares tonight
790358607606976512 2016-10-23 01:05:50 UTC <verygooster> They're really gonna drag this shit out, huh #TheWalkingDead
790356944422862848 2016-10-23 00:59:14 UTC <verygooster> God that Walking Dead finale was so bad. So bad.
790353596592390144 2016-10-23 00:45:56 UTC <verygooster> We figured it out eventually lol. It was hilarious though.
790353237425713152 2016-10-23 00:44:30 UTC <verygooster> Falcons get off to a hot start and then lose a game SHOCKED.
790345951378628608 2016-10-23 00:15:33 UTC <verygooster> So @Sheriff0fPaddys and I are like stuck on this windy turret part of Gears 4 wondering if we're missing something lol
790336526668460032 2016-10-23 23:38:06 UTC <verygooster> There's a Swarm in Gears 4 that does Triple H's entrance
790304636838240256 2016-10-23 21:31:23 UTC <verygooster> BIG PLAY *called back by flag* NFL sucks
790301078130716672 2016-10-23 21:17:14 UTC <verygooster> i could do a party if you want. I have ear buds and a mic should work
790299109525753856 2016-10-23 21:09:25 UTC <verygooster> yes this Pats-Steelers game is trash
790295064547295232 2016-10-23 20:53:21 UTC <verygooster> I am totally in for Bernie being the budget chairman
790281159854948352 2016-10-23 19:58:05 UTC <verygooster> Red Kryptonite stories are so fun and Supergirl is no exception.
790280869458108419 2016-10-23 19:56:56 UTC <verygooster> Nah I'm down to play lol Just got to move my Xbox
790280427453968384 2016-10-23 19:55:11 UTC <verygooster> I thought you got called into work?
790279956165193730 2016-10-23 19:53:18 UTC <verygooster> Damn I stopped watching Red Zone to fire up a Supergirl episode lol
790275803976171520 2016-10-23 19:36:48 UTC <verygooster> @LegacyZ3RO lol damn. Rove ain't even gonna try any of his magic math from 2012?
790269672025366528 2016-10-23 19:12:26 UTC <verygooster> Maybe revenue has to drop or something. Just amazed what a clueless guy Goodell is. Or maybe he's not clueless & doesn't care
790267090229944320 2016-10-23 19:02:11 UTC <verygooster> Collins has to be NFC DPOTW especially after these games. Jesus.
790266830938107904 2016-10-23 19:01:09 UTC <verygooster> @hesstoytruck @TheHumble_21 @Giants has to be NFC DPOTW
790266692207308801 2016-10-23 19:00:36 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman "TRUMP IS JUST TRYING TO KEEP RELIGION OUT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT"
790265656851722241 2016-10-23 18:56:29 UTC <verygooster> Feel like everything WWE watchers complained about the last few years applies here. Bad booking. Roger is Vince.
790265538698248192 2016-10-23 18:56:01 UTC <verygooster> Thursday night game is Jags-Titans lol. This league is a joke.
790264528730816514 2016-10-23 18:52:00 UTC <verygooster> I'm watching but I still hope NFL ratings keep tanking tbh
790264339320205312 2016-10-23 18:51:15 UTC <verygooster> @austin_walker Thanks. Watching the trailer on the App Store. Might have to grab this one!
790264082477834240 2016-10-23 18:50:14 UTC <verygooster> Breeland sucks too
790263087190446081 2016-10-23 18:46:17 UTC <verygooster> @austin_walker what game is this?
790262824165670917 2016-10-23 18:45:14 UTC <verygooster> dude got paid to cover OBJ basically and he didn't even do that
790258565240029185 2016-10-23 18:28:18 UTC <verygooster> The Giants might actually have a better o-line than the Vikings. Ouch.
790257663749787648 2016-10-23 18:24:43 UTC <verygooster> AJ GREEN  LMAO BROWNS
790254008518729728 2016-10-23 18:10:12 UTC <verygooster> @katienolan must be Sunday!
790244718613520388 2016-10-23 17:33:17 UTC <verygooster> Eagles and Vikings playing like it's Thursday
790243197964476417 2016-10-23 17:27:15 UTC <verygooster> I'VE BEEN WAITIN' ALL DAY FOR FUCKBALL ... DAY 
790239551369408513 2016-10-23 17:12:45 UTC <verygooster> @JordanRaanan Offensive line isn't talented enough to build a wall to protect him anyway
790233737057402880 2016-10-23 16:49:39 UTC <verygooster> Also McAdoo's playcaling has been abhorrent at this point and doing too much. Just hand it off to Sullivan.
790232659398123524 2016-10-23 16:45:22 UTC <verygooster> @atPeteDodd Yep! Also it is becoming clearer that Eli and McAdoo do not trust that line
790230806178439168 2016-10-23 16:38:00 UTC <verygooster> Giants really needed that win, now above .500, and now headed into a bye week with some chance of resting up and getting healthy
790230405983117312 2016-10-23 16:36:25 UTC <verygooster> @art_stapleton Is this the first game they've won by a full touchdown this year?
790230199275253761 2016-10-23 16:35:35 UTC <verygooster> Props to Jeff Fisher for really really living up to thispic.twitter.com/sFy7c2VgPI
790229878717181952 2016-10-23 16:34:19 UTC <verygooster> WOW lmao
790227476333101056 2016-10-23 16:24:46 UTC <verygooster> Wow, Rams
790225270229860352 2016-10-23 16:16:00 UTC <verygooster> I dunno why you would try that a second time Keenum but thanks for the gift.
790225060338499584 2016-10-23 16:15:10 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n DRC thought so too!
790224658259931136 2016-10-23 16:13:34 UTC <verygooster> Woof that 3rd & 22 conversion was killer
790223628981919744 2016-10-23 16:09:29 UTC <verygooster> @shinobi602 My favorite is when you switch to Michael and he's driving his family somewhere and I just run them over repeatedly lol
790222526169411584 2016-10-23 16:05:06 UTC <verygooster> @RVacchianoSNY Yes. great they scored but not gonna pretend the running game is hot all of a sudden
790221153184935936 2016-10-23 15:59:39 UTC <verygooster> Collins Beckhampic.twitter.com/6KlZEV5hfi
790219473437458436 2016-10-23 15:52:58 UTC <verygooster> @bigblueview whoever gets the next score wins. Easily.
790216725606334464 2016-10-23 15:42:03 UTC <verygooster> This is the playcalling. This is it. This is how it's going to be the rest of the year because the o-line is bad.pic.twitter.com/0LKsIJ0W97
790215784991756288 2016-10-23 15:38:19 UTC <verygooster> Breaking news Larry Donnell sucks.
790204460710686720 2016-10-23 14:53:19 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina Keep exposing themselves with this TE in the backfield formation

790194744114737152 2016-10-23 14:14:42 UTC <verygooster> @zackreese I remember going to TRU the Friday it came out. Played from about 4pm until 7am the following day
790192080618487808 2016-10-23 14:04:07 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina I say this is just a bad team

790185809685147649 2016-10-23 13:39:12 UTC <verygooster> How did the Giants get so bad on turnovers?
790022013335330816 2016-10-22 02:48:20 UTC <verygooster> @zackreese lmao hell of a year to start following them
790021796259065856 2016-10-22 02:47:28 UTC <verygooster> I legit dozed off during the 8th inning though lol

789565160318967808 2016-10-21 20:32:58 UTC <verygooster> I'll take "My kid is a pain in the ass"
789565063061536768 2016-10-21 20:32:35 UTC <verygooster> Maybe speaking too soon but super glad JD and Marcus aren't written/introduced anyway as "estranged father/son, son is mad at dad"
789559093212184576 2016-10-21 20:08:51 UTC <verygooster> Is Twitter on iOS busted or what
789548298403192832 2016-10-21 19:25:58 UTC <verygooster> watching the WWE 2k17 quick look and it looks so bad
789529305470660608 2016-10-21 18:10:29 UTC <verygooster> Plumeria and Team Skull look like Jet Set Radio characters
789518740174012416 2016-10-21 17:28:30 UTC <verygooster> Man I'm already kinda taken aback by the world in this Pokmon Sun/Moon demo. I can't wait for this game.

789503397292568576 2016-10-21 16:27:32 UTC <verygooster> @BigBlueUnited Mara showing he's no better than any other profiting NFL owner
789494616059965440 2016-10-21 15:52:39 UTC <verygooster> Nintendo Switch got announced before Sombra
789479564007309312 2016-10-21 14:52:50 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n Giants can't play their bull shit "class organization" card any more. Mara and the league botched this badly.
789478867169927168 2016-10-21 14:50:04 UTC <verygooster> Give me a fucking break, Eli. Odell & the kicking net is a distraction.https://twitter.com/greggrosenthal/status/789446948675727360
789478350385471488 2016-10-21 14:48:01 UTC <verygooster> @janesports "Distraction." Come the fuck on, Eli.
789477830191149056 2016-10-21 14:45:57 UTC <verygooster> Props to the state for upgrading the flip-phones their employees had been using until yesterday for non-exploding Galaxy S phones
789472754370240512 2016-10-21 14:25:46 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I was probably 5 of those views alone
789470929156014080 2016-10-21 14:18:31 UTC <verygooster> @ArcadeGirl64 Or at least a successor
789470893718302720 2016-10-21 14:18:23 UTC <verygooster> @ArcadeGirl64 The kind of community and creativity fostered thanks to MM, would be super disappointing if there's no Switch port

789290554341351424 2016-10-20 02:21:47 UTC <verygooster> @wlatham92 I would try one but hearing "DEEP FRIED TWINKIES" and then "LIVE BETTER" cracked me up

789277946871738368 2016-10-20 01:31:41 UTC <verygooster> Goodell can't figure out why NFL ratings are lower than usual.  Maybe it's because Matt Barkley is quarterbacking a game in 2016
789274746340929536 2016-10-20 01:18:58 UTC <verygooster> Just realized Hank from Supergirl is in COD IW
789273646976135169 2016-10-20 01:14:36 UTC <verygooster> RIP Brian Hoyer, possibly the best Bears QB of all time

789240973276672000 2016-10-20 23:04:46 UTC <verygooster> @KelsODonnell Like when Mara was being told this stuff was the cleaning guy vacuuming too loud while signing Brown's contract??
789240559412113408 2016-10-20 23:03:07 UTC <verygooster> I'm more embarrassed about how Giants/Mara/NFL handled this Josh Brown thing than the last four fucking seasons
789240287977766913 2016-10-20 23:02:02 UTC <verygooster> @AlexSinclairNFL And of course Goodell isn't anywhere to be seen but hey THOSE TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATIONS & INTEGRITY OF THE GAME etc etc
789240133967028224 2016-10-20 23:01:25 UTC <verygooster> @AlexSinclairNFL Yup. The MOMENT they got a whiff of this Brown should have been gone.
789239729606844420 2016-10-20 22:59:49 UTC <verygooster> @AlexSinclairNFL The Giants are .500 and I still hate this season

789125586631417856 2016-10-20 15:26:15 UTC <verygooster> @Sawyer_DAA That was my initial 'fear' per se. I LOVED RDR's desert design but didn't feel like a type of geography I needed to revisit
789124029366038528 2016-10-20 15:20:04 UTC <verygooster> @dasme I know it's just an advertisement but just looks like my hands couldn't deal with the Joy-Con... things... with the size difference
789121150592937984 2016-10-20 15:08:38 UTC <verygooster> @Wrath2X Yeah, usually it's the teaser, first trailer, game explanation, final trailer/TV spot
789119576902631424 2016-10-20 15:02:22 UTC <verygooster> That was it? #RDR2
789118363326906368 2016-10-20 14:57:33 UTC <verygooster> So I CAN use a Pro Controller on just that screen, right?
789114627372220421 2016-10-20 14:42:42 UTC <verygooster> @Wrath2X imagine if a Switch logo appeared at the end alongside PS4/Xbox One
789111552267935744 2016-10-20 14:30:29 UTC <verygooster> Why does it look like a horror movie puzzle trap
789110460947783680 2016-10-20 14:26:09 UTC <verygooster> I wonder if I am reading too much into the Splatoon part where Nintendo might have some esports interest?
789109675816022016 2016-10-20 14:23:02 UTC <verygooster> And @ArcadeGirl64 sounding likehttps://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/789109380939644928
789109299222081536 2016-10-20 14:21:32 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I already feel like my hands are too big for them watching the one dude use it NES-controller style
789108912620437504 2016-10-20 14:20:00 UTC <verygooster> I just want that portable screen to be good and bright and sharp
789108556045885440 2016-10-20 14:18:35 UTC <verygooster> @Kyoufu2011 I keep seeing it is but no source
789108142437261312 2016-10-20 14:16:56 UTC <verygooster> @setaimx Take Two is one of the listed partners and NBA 2K was in that trailer
789107610024902656 2016-10-20 14:14:49 UTC <verygooster> @ByteSizeImp short cast tonight?
789107496778694657 2016-10-20 14:14:22 UTC <verygooster> @Dystify Confirmed?
789107425974579200 2016-10-20 14:14:05 UTC <verygooster> @Wrath2X I like the gunmetal color too if thats what the final product will look like
789106408075698178 2016-10-20 14:10:03 UTC <verygooster> I had liked the possibility of Wii U off-tv play but I grew to loathe that screen over time
789106264555028480 2016-10-20 14:09:29 UTC <verygooster> I mean, I only take my 3DS to cons. Portable Switch could be fun around the house if that screen is bright and sharp enough
789105915677044736 2016-10-20 14:08:05 UTC <verygooster> I am already entertaining the possibility of lining up at Nintendo NY for this thing. I can just Uber back. :P
789105400369020928 2016-10-20 14:06:02 UTC <verygooster> @SuperNintendad I mean wouldnt it be either 2K or Live?
789105152288493568 2016-10-20 14:05:03 UTC <verygooster> I can play Switch games portable with that Pro-looking controller right? Because my hands might be too big for those little sticks
789105007916441601 2016-10-20 14:04:29 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda NBA 2K

789091878775947264 2016-10-20 13:12:19 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR I'm not saying I want like this low-key drama Logan looks to be from Captain America, but that this is what I want now versus that
789091515326930944 2016-10-20 13:10:52 UTC <verygooster> Supergirl being the outlier which I've been enjoying because it's the only spectacle I'm watching right now really
789091155992535040 2016-10-20 13:09:26 UTC <verygooster> I know the desire for bombast and spectacle is still there but this is why I took to Netflix shows more than DC/MCU movies etc. as of late
789090954439487488 2016-10-20 13:08:38 UTC <verygooster> If Logan goes in the direction it looks like it goes, this is more or less what I want with these comic characters nowadays
789090269123715076 2016-10-20 13:05:55 UTC <verygooster> Okay I really liked that Logan trailer
789081007064485888 2016-10-20 12:29:07 UTC <verygooster> Legit hope NX is still March, even if the tail end of the month because that'd totally be my birthday gift :)
789079698022203393 2016-10-20 12:23:55 UTC <verygooster> Hillary: "The oppression of the Sith will never return! You have lost!"  Trump: "No... no no no YOU ARE THE PUPPET!"
789077680075440129 2016-10-20 12:15:53 UTC <verygooster> @Phazon4G 3 minutes is plenty of time to show Metroid Prime 4, F-Zero FX, Pokmon HD, Super Mario NX, Mario Kart 9, Animal Crossing, Zelda

788932505516773376 2016-10-19 02:39:01 UTC <verygooster> I don't participate in the Obama cult of personality enough to care either way if he gets four more years
788928806530719745 2016-10-19 02:24:19 UTC <verygooster> Like Hillary HAS to be embarrassed to fuckin share this stage and tradition with this dude, right?

788925401049468928 2016-10-19 02:10:47 UTC <verygooster> Trump actually took the bait and played the "rigged" card  you  just  playyyyyyyeeeeedd  yourrrrrrrr  sellffffffffffffffffffffffff
788924790899892225 2016-10-19 02:08:22 UTC <verygooster> Agree that HIllary was off re: Saudi Arabia and Qatar  but holy fuck her entire deck is just trap cards
788923529404223488 2016-10-19 02:03:21 UTC <verygooster> Didn't the charity watchdog groups give the CLinton Foundation high marks?  But sure, criminal enterprise

788810625690533888 2016-10-19 18:34:43 UTC <verygooster> Don't really understand the "LOL MS SPIN" on that Xbox One promo. Didn't they take #1 in Aug-Sep or whenever? No kidding they'll market that

788421266441113600 2016-10-18 16:47:32 UTC <verygooster> NX plot thickens
788397479028989952 2016-10-18 15:13:01 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san And it's hard for sure because we have different experiences but not falling back to stereotypes shouldn't be hard
788397384501960704 2016-10-18 15:12:38 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san when I attempt to write fiction I just want to write characters as living, breathing people, and not pigeonhole them in a role
788397258983243776 2016-10-18 15:12:08 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san Yep. Trying to get the foundations of a work going w/ a friend & we were having the conversation about characters/archetypes, etc
788396135085932544 2016-10-18 15:07:40 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman lol It's one thing to say "Well, we don't know that it'll be delayed" vs "SHOW ME THE RECEIPTS, PATRICK!!!!!!" Wow

788395083649392640 2016-10-18 15:03:30 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII for me now fuckball depends on the teams/division. Like I'll probably watch A.A. Ron shit the bed Thursday

788391629778456576 2016-10-18 14:49:46 UTC <verygooster> This isn't an anomaly. MNF has been around for 40+ years but trying to cram games 4 of 7 days a week is gonna result in a bad product

785352681082806272 2016-10-09 05:34:04 UTC <verygooster> @JordanRaanan I hope you're okay because that isn't right.https://twitter.com/dduggan21/status/785351367250571264
785333466791612416 2016-10-09 04:17:43 UTC <verygooster> And honestly, we aren't talking Mittens anymore. If somehow you're still "undecided" you're probably a closeted bigot and you can quote me
785333136490164224 2016-10-09 04:16:25 UTC <verygooster> Personally I love the "HE'S ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT" narrative while ignoring he's writing checks anti-gov't people hate seeing lobbyists cashhttps://twitter.com/zackreese/status/785332895145525248
785330005584805888 2016-10-09 04:03:58 UTC <verygooster> He's checking out of a lot more plays and is skittish as all hell lately but hey, I'm not the head coach so \_()_/https://twitter.com/JamesKratch/status/785329804023328768
785324086914326530 2016-10-09 03:40:27 UTC <verygooster> MAYBE CHALLENGE THAT, MCADOO
785322585999413248 2016-10-09 03:34:29 UTC <verygooster> @NESbot_feed like this thread isn't an excuse to say "No Man's Sky" or some shit
785322491552161792 2016-10-09 03:34:07 UTC <verygooster> LMAO OBJ HUGGED THE NET
785316465796911104 2016-10-09 03:10:10 UTC <verygooster> "EVERYTHING IS CORRECTABLE" McAdoo in Week 1, and 2, and 3, etc.https://twitter.com/Patricia_Traina/status/785316221008932864
785315877982011392 2016-10-09 03:07:50 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n Been wondering that about A.A. Ron too. Last season it seemed like more often than not the offense was out of sync
785315625468067846 2016-10-09 03:06:50 UTC <verygooster> And now as you can see, I am in the Acceptance stage of what is probably another 6-10 Giants season despite that FA spending spree
785315403580989440 2016-10-09 03:05:57 UTC <verygooster> ...and it's not just the o-line, Eli has happy feet or not letting plays develop... or McAdoo is being RIDICULOUSLY conservative
785315190954917888 2016-10-09 03:05:06 UTC <verygooster> Now I give the Vikes 100% props for their defense but GB is missing two key DBs against what should be an ace WR corps...and nothing...
785315056233963524 2016-10-09 03:04:34 UTC <verygooster> I FELT something was up when the Giants didn't put up like 80 points on the Saints a month ago.
785314049282215936 2016-10-09 03:00:34 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I also felt like Flowers needed a season to adjust but he just seems bad honestly. Bad hands and footing.
785313964427280384 2016-10-09 03:00:14 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I know he's a rookie but Perkins has been making plays. Understand they want to limit him but also why not at this point.
785312618143748096 2016-10-09 02:54:53 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I have no idea what he did to this offensive playbook if anything, among other factors
785312551261310976 2016-10-09 02:54:37 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I give Todd Bowles a lot of shit but so far it's like having a white Bowles on this team
785311952893579264 2016-10-09 02:52:14 UTC <verygooster> @katienolan first time in like two hours I've laughed. thank you
785311390382821376 2016-10-09 02:50:00 UTC <verygooster> @AutomaticZen It seems like people expect Hillary to literally be Kate McKinnon when she'd rather Trump play himself
785309906421346304 2016-10-09 02:44:06 UTC <verygooster> @PLeonardNYDN will  WILL  W I L L .
785308851490975744 2016-10-09 02:39:55 UTC <verygooster> This defense is getting the job done for a fucking 3rd & 4387328492374589234732 shotgun draw

785304798916710400 2016-10-09 02:23:48 UTC <verygooster> Did everyone in the fucking NFL come together and said OKAY GUYS WERE ALL ABOUT CHECKDOWNS ON THIRD DOWN OKAY? COOL.
785304085566291968 2016-10-09 02:20:58 UTC <verygooster> Yes. Keep feeding the ball to Darkwa who hasnt done a thing tonight.

785301162245382145 2016-10-09 02:09:21 UTC <verygooster> If Hillary was a good senator Will Tye makes that touchdown catch
785301055861055489 2016-10-09 02:08:56 UTC <verygooster> @Sawyer_DAA obviously you didnt play MGS
785299104884723712 2016-10-09 02:01:11 UTC <verygooster> @squick4n I am starting to theorize Eli is secretly hurt or something. His accuracy is dipping like crazy.
785298882339151873 2016-10-09 02:00:18 UTC <verygooster> @KSIXI I dont even know what to say. Somehow this team feels worse than last year
785298399482568704 2016-10-09 01:58:23 UTC <verygooster> Elis been lighting it up the last two years. Ive defended the guy the last few years but hes becoming a problem, too
785297746555236353 2016-10-09 01:55:47 UTC <verygooster> MAKE THAT FUCKING CATCH, TYE
785297571824697344 2016-10-09 01:55:05 UTC <verygooster> Yep. Only Hillary had the sole power to change NYs tax code. Thats how that fucking works.

785294872957812737 2016-10-09 01:44:22 UTC <verygooster> Describe Trump in one sentence:  The tests determined THAT was a lie!
785294318990942209 2016-10-09 01:42:10 UTC <verygooster> Im starting to think Eli is actually hurt because he is checking out of plays super fast against a defense missing key guys

785292273407893504 2016-10-09 01:34:02 UTC <verygooster> Maybe Just maybe Its time for Reese to consider a fucking linebacker on this team
785291272424652801 2016-10-09 01:30:04 UTC <verygooster> We brought up the emails. No it hasnt. Its Sunday. No it isnt. You are Donald Trump. No Im not.

785283531824107520 2016-10-09 00:59:18 UTC <verygooster> I must be the only one who REALLY wants this debate to start for my sake
785283461544378368 2016-10-09 00:59:01 UTC <verygooster> Jenkins looks hurt. The defense cant tackle. Offensive is off to a not great start.

785251154162778113 2016-10-09 22:50:39 UTC <verygooster> Again, I legit hope Raiders take the playoff spot (or hey, maybe a first round bye even) that the Bengals have been wasting for years

784187037234626560 2016-10-06 00:22:13 UTC <verygooster> Gears 4 installed. Bring on Tuesday.
784186644152877056 2016-10-06 00:20:40 UTC <verygooster> still might end up seeing it but not sure I'll care about MCU after the Guardians sequel
784184279840460800 2016-10-06 00:11:16 UTC <verygooster> @wlatham92 but yeah Luke Cage is absolutely the more 'real' show
784184104006868993 2016-10-06 00:10:34 UTC <verygooster> @wlatham92 in sorta HK's defense, Harlem is a huge massive community. Hell Kitchen is like six blocks lol

784149733187153921 2016-10-06 21:53:59 UTC <verygooster> @ebenezersamuel Odds the next Hillary/Trump debate is just about Odell for 90 minutes?
784148834557521921 2016-10-06 21:50:25 UTC <verygooster> @setaimx I'm amazed at the people who finish it like the next day. I'm more of a pace myself type of viewer

784095027383377920 2016-10-06 18:16:36 UTC <verygooster> @Valdezology Yep! Had the same issue last year
784094472275628033 2016-10-06 18:14:24 UTC <verygooster> @Valdezology I wish they'd find a way to like refocus the lighting for pics like that ha ha
784093977783988224 2016-10-06 18:12:26 UTC <verygooster> @Valdezology Is that at the same area where the BvS suits were last year?
784093761454366720 2016-10-06 18:11:35 UTC <verygooster> @art_stapleton Man that bye week can't come soon enough for him
784092710370156548 2016-10-06 18:07:24 UTC <verygooster> it's still on until tonight it seems, so cool I will now download Gears of War 4
784088007750090753 2016-10-06 17:48:43 UTC <verygooster> I don't even know who to ask: is that @PayPal @GearsofWar 4 preorder promo still a thing? @Xbox @XboxSupport
784082304520056832 2016-10-06 17:26:03 UTC <verygooster> @shinobi602 I remember when Cliffy B went after Jim Sterling for giving GOW3 an 8/10
784059257050304512 2016-10-06 15:54:28 UTC <verygooster> (i sorta want the Inside Out iOS sticker app)
784020873200148484 2016-10-06 13:21:57 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I'll probably pick back up on it in a week or two but the tail end of S2 lost steam for me
784020719051169792 2016-10-06 13:21:20 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman I didn't watch though my initial fear was that it would take them a month to resolve "Flashpoint" but nice that they did it in one

783859997771988992 2016-10-05 02:42:41 UTC <verygooster> The umpire sucks.
783834896204697600 2016-10-05 01:02:56 UTC <verygooster> I don't know what the replay guys were looking at where Span is out. #NLWildCard
783831290298630144 2016-10-05 00:48:37 UTC <verygooster> S1 is not great. Tries too hard to be Mad Men in the 80s. S2 is good but I also don't blame you. Really niche concept.
783828522641088512 2016-10-05 00:37:37 UTC <verygooster> I feel like they got asked to make it more relatable and a lot of S3 touches on like internet security... in 1986
783826627209879552 2016-10-05 00:30:05 UTC <verygooster> Went from "Let's build a PC!" in S1 to "We made eBay and going public!" in like three in-universe years.
783826372334645248 2016-10-05 00:29:04 UTC <verygooster> Halt & Catch Fire had a good season 3 but the technology arc jumps are weird.
783815591798927361 2016-10-05 23:46:14 UTC <verygooster> Omg this Chance KitKat commercial
783775203373506565 2016-10-05 21:05:44 UTC <verygooster> Man I know injuries are common in football but I got like 20 "<x> is out vs <opponent>" and "out for the season" notifications today alone
783765026951798785 2016-10-05 20:25:18 UTC <verygooster> Catching the end of the The Karate Kid: -Johnny spends the match trying to cripple Daniel-san -Johnny loses "HEY LARUSSO YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!"
783740233619832837 2016-10-05 18:46:47 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII Insane is probably more doable on co-op. The AI sucks. You may as well be by yourself.
783732741435162624 2016-10-05 18:17:01 UTC <verygooster> Gears of War Ultimate on Hardcore is not worth the AI headaches
783707929656655872 2016-10-05 16:38:25 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman guessing this is a Stranger Things-like generator but from where?

783654721034813440 2016-10-05 13:06:59 UTC <verygooster> Damn. Jeff can't hang with PSVR
783653332229455872 2016-10-05 13:01:28 UTC <verygooster> @Sawyer_DAA Saw that too. That's Nintendo levels of recommendation
783651572400132097 2016-10-05 12:54:29 UTC <verygooster> You can't escape Bruce Wayne's parents getting murdered even in VR

783508814112952321 2016-10-04 03:27:12 UTC <verygooster> @KennerToys damn these Westworld spoilers
783505853806706688 2016-10-04 03:15:27 UTC <verygooster> Pence speaking better doesn't seem like much of a win. The story is probably going to be his inability to refute anything about Trump.
783502076865282052 2016-10-04 03:00:26 UTC <verygooster> I think I actually want the O's to take this  ...

783493326003724288 2016-10-04 02:25:40 UTC <verygooster> when do I get to hear about America's number one enemy, a one Mr. Ben Ghazi????
783491718570188801 2016-10-04 02:19:16 UTC <verygooster> Ah, I love the "THE MILITARY IS UNDERFUNDED" rhetoric........
783489442015219712 2016-10-04 02:10:14 UTC <verygooster> I discovered I actually like playing that game with the Wiimote (I always look for an excuse to use my Luigi one tho)
783487752386048000 2016-10-04 02:03:31 UTC <verygooster> Almost pulled a muscle trying to do this time trial (using the Wiimote)
783480132329693184 2016-10-04 01:33:14 UTC <verygooster> I fired up DKC Tropical Freeze for the first time in two years maybe and unlocked that first silhouette stage and the music is divine
783474190905139200 2016-10-04 01:09:38 UTC <verygooster> Mike Pence looks like a Bond villain.  And a bigoted pile of shit.
783474121816539137 2016-10-04 01:09:21 UTC <verygooster> @Patricia_Traina Yup. Pugh had his number that day.
783458523615207424 2016-10-04 00:07:22 UTC <verygooster> @ByteSizeImp Not talking about the win-loss record. The Odell drama is getting out of hand
783456699290046470 2016-10-04 00:00:07 UTC <verygooster> I was like a pixel away from one of the Bella sisters chainsawing my head off, and the last bullet in the magazine kills her #RE4

783149293163122689 2016-10-03 03:38:36 UTC <verygooster> So is this going to be another season where the Giants might only beat up on bad teams? AFC North is gonna feast at this point.
783146461114593287 2016-10-03 03:27:21 UTC <verygooster> @antitrop love seeing EA's diversity on display!
783142443449520128 2016-10-03 03:11:23 UTC <verygooster> The Giants are ridiculously undisciplined and can't seem to scheme to get their supposed studs open.  But the Vikings defense is l-e-g-i-t.
783132723221262336 2016-10-03 02:32:45 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII Well... I can't pretend I thought we had a chance tonight so
783132572079493121 2016-10-03 02:32:09 UTC <verygooster> Okay. Back to Luke Cage.
783132454773227520 2016-10-03 02:31:41 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII go away
783129696527613953 2016-10-03 02:20:44 UTC <verygooster> Yep. This is a Giants Monday Night Football game.
783128844731551744 2016-10-03 02:17:21 UTC <verygooster> I think OBJ does need to rein it in, but also media reaction to his every little move is pretty ridiculous and he has to play that game ...
783124238647582721 2016-10-03 01:59:02 UTC <verygooster> @KSIXI Yeah it's hard to put it w/o sounding like a homer/tinfoil hat nut but refs definitely looking at him more
783119696249970692 2016-10-03 01:40:59 UTC <verygooster> @StevePoliti What does that make Xavier Rhodes then
783118784030773248 2016-10-03 01:37:22 UTC <verygooster> That WAS a late hit on Odell but he needs to chill

783112205608816640 2016-10-03 01:11:13 UTC <verygooster> @KSIXI I already want to check out by halftime and just continue Luke Cage ...
783112130656632832 2016-10-03 01:10:56 UTC <verygooster> Not that anything is going for the offense but Flowers is killing this line

779104458101915648 2016-09-22 23:45:52 UTC <verygooster> So yeah: I liked S2 of Mr. Robot but didn't love it. Feel like some of the audience toying needs to be reined in a bit for S3.

769606814157733888 2016-08-27 18:45:37 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda the stupid part was the media assuming Cowboys could run away if ROMO COULD STAY HEALTHY, like he was going 16 gms w/o a sack???

769219481176510466 2016-08-26 17:06:30 UTC <verygooster> any time I see a John Oliver clip: *thing in the world that's kinda messed up* *meh hyperbolic comparison joke* *"John Oliver EVISCERATES-"*

768810061720383488 2016-08-25 13:59:37 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 no, it's that I can't just grab a pic from OneDrive and make it Xbox One wallpaper, and that's dumb, had to grab it from a USB
768809581820665856 2016-08-25 13:57:42 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 really
768801584738365444 2016-08-25 13:25:56 UTC <verygooster> so I assumed since OneDrive is a thing I'd ul a pic for X1 wallpaper but... I can't, and need to do it via USB...pic.twitter.com/eC16sU8Ip5

768624240182648832 2016-08-24 01:41:13 UTC <verygooster> Kudos to Doom for not opening with a 20 minute cutscene before you get control of the game
768618628497469440 2016-08-24 01:18:55 UTC <verygooster> @NECA_TOYS @BradleyHail after I saw the new Rick Grimes figure they put out.... Lollllllllll

768545361208147968 2016-08-24 20:27:47 UTC <verygooster> complaining about big patches is a bit tired but damn 18 GB for Doom?  (I THINK it said 18 GB anyway)

768509194467246080 2016-08-24 18:04:04 UTC <verygooster> @King_Seda my understanding of it is he wants to be paid his bonus at the end of the season rather than next offseason

743198634091610112 2016-06-15 21:48:56 UTC <verygooster> Has Nintendo said anything about Beat Buy demos or is Zelda just gonna be a Nintendo NY thing?

742768283582124034 2016-06-14 17:18:53 UTC <verygooster> honestly I've become okay with the weapon durability mechanic over the years
742767880647933952 2016-06-14 17:17:17 UTC <verygooster> I'm hoping all that craft and cooking stuff is actually essential to the game and not busywork because I'm a sucker for that micromanagement

735310593549344770 2016-05-24 03:24:41 UTC <verygooster> I know Hollywood just sees games as brands but I wonder what game it would take to fuck up so bad they're like never mind

735224962068426752 2016-05-24 21:44:25 UTC <verygooster> 95% of games journalism will now be Overwatch gifs
735224139401814017 2016-05-24 21:41:09 UTC <verygooster> It seems to be the argument since its drawing less flak vs SF5s launch or something.

733733521039196161 2016-05-20 18:57:58 UTC <verygooster> @AutomaticZen in my last tweet: honestly, I wonder if the veteran actors (Bridges, Redford, Goldblum) find the MCU to be a godsend
733733207217209344 2016-05-20 18:56:43 UTC <verygooster> Maybe aging isn't the word, but 'veteran'
733732998319853568 2016-05-20 18:55:53 UTC <verygooster> Aging (and established) actors must find the MCU to be a godsend
733703248872361985 2016-05-20 16:57:40 UTC <verygooster> @Roto13 like maybe that sounds petty in the long run but it's almost as obnoxious to me as a thread with just bad posts
733703142328705024 2016-05-20 16:57:15 UTC <verygooster> @Roto13 then if it's not the stupid post, then it's the post that DOES offer some rational thought & then everyone is circlejerking that one

733686346099871744 2016-05-20 15:50:30 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR probably aware but that NYCC fan verification thing is going up in like 10 minutes (watch that shit crash)
733676061658124288 2016-05-20 15:09:38 UTC <verygooster> it looks fun and not messy in the way the 2014 movie (and trailers) were.
733675059085234176 2016-05-20 15:05:39 UTC <verygooster> that new TMNT trailer looks pretty fun honestly  but man I hated Michelangelo in that 2014 movie SO MUCH. SO MUCH.

728234626376978433 2016-05-05 14:47:19 UTC <verygooster> Anyway I showed my friend, a teacher, a picture of those Power Ranger suits and all his kids hate it apparently lol
728232896184586240 2016-05-05 14:40:27 UTC <verygooster> but then again after Mighty Morphin I was pretty much done with them so that might have something to do with it
728232529740890112 2016-05-05 14:38:59 UTC <verygooster> Gonna draw flak. Not judging. You do you and all that, but I am honestly a bit surprised anyone over age 10 even cares about Power Rangers.

718528494045655041 2016-04-08 19:58:37 UTC <verygooster> @fourhman  the 'player avatar' thing feels less true with major release in the 3D era. Not a bad thing, but commit to it or don't, Nintendo

718465754304262144 2016-04-08 15:49:18 UTC <verygooster> Though feels like Links become less and less self-inserted character with each major release

714897850426081280 2016-03-29 19:31:44 UTC <verygooster> @Roto13 But honestly like that whole arc with his trial and the aftermath I was legit immersed in. DD/Elektra felt shoehorned.
714897655189618688 2016-03-29 19:30:57 UTC <verygooster> @APowell2099 Elektra was pretty much to being that show's Felicity lol

714600738400432128 2016-03-28 23:51:07 UTC <verygooster> For a show that had Glen Bishop, Ken in an eyepatch, a dude's foot getting shredded, Bob Benson is the weirdest thing about Mad Men to me.

714231157546696705 2016-03-27 23:22:32 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII That goes without saying
714229278322397184 2016-03-27 23:15:04 UTC <verygooster> Eisenberg is awful as Luthor but Topher Grace as Venom just hurts.
714229230251425792 2016-03-27 23:14:52 UTC <verygooster> I found Spider-Man 3 on tv and inevitably asked myself if that was worse than BvS. Ultimately I'd say so.
714217681759703044 2016-03-27 22:28:59 UTC <verygooster> Although I'll come clean and just say a friend and I farmed the "kill 20 rogues" trophy
714217182662639617 2016-03-27 22:27:00 UTC <verygooster> I think I'm like three trophies away from platinum-ing The Division
714210910303289345 2016-03-27 22:02:05 UTC <verygooster> The opening fight of Daredevil S2E11 would be super fun if there wasn't an obnoxious blinking light in the scene

713767024598585344 2016-03-26 16:38:14 UTC <verygooster> @zabu_san Yeah it was nice to see one of my favorite characters after *checks naked wrist* 20-30 years or so
713764737520156672 2016-03-26 16:29:09 UTC <verygooster> @hEnereyG in spite of everything I felt about that movie I was legitimately excited to see WW on a movie screen
713556825430487040 2016-03-25 02:42:59 UTC <verygooster> @TheRealAbed godspeed
713515597653520384 2016-03-25 23:59:09 UTC <verygooster> @TheRealAbed Like I wouldn't have known otherwise or assumed in the movie so I dunno wtf Snyder wants me to do with that information
713515482851225601 2016-03-25 23:58:42 UTC <verygooster> @TheRealAbed Oh my GOD. It's like Snyder trying to wink at you and nudging you with his elbow but it's an elbow to face instead.
713515024287940616 2016-03-25 23:56:52 UTC <verygooster> @TheRealAbed Curious if he would have gotten the same material Eisenberg did. Because YEESH

713506287334633472 2016-03-25 23:22:09 UTC <verygooster> @stephensajdak when a Michael Shannon blurb puts more thought into Superman than a 2 and a half hour movie
713502959620001792 2016-03-25 23:08:56 UTC <verygooster> @austin_walker that face when level 60 meme mondays
713493027252269060 2016-03-25 22:29:28 UTC <verygooster> @Line_XIII Like, Bay's made bad movies, but I feel like he knows what he's making at least and I almost respect that lol.
713492638515769344 2016-03-25 22:27:55 UTC <verygooster> .@Line_XIII Snyder is Bay without the self-awareness
713489649159835648 2016-03-25 22:16:03 UTC <verygooster> @zackreese *sees sex scandal trend* Oh this should be fun
713489498550771712 2016-03-25 22:15:27 UTC <verygooster> @zackreese More like Ted LOSE(r)
713488976422813696 2016-03-25 22:13:22 UTC <verygooster> Zack Snyder is not a storyteller. The guy just likes pasting scenes without any sort of cohesion because they look cool, I guess.
713475718915756036 2016-03-25 21:20:41 UTC <verygooster> @gazele87 For as much as I wasn't into the trailers, I wanted to be proven wrong. Found it bloated and poorly written.
713474344916267008 2016-03-25 21:15:14 UTC <verygooster> Like I'm sure I cracked on it for weeks but I legitimately went in with an 'open mind' or whatever you want to call it. I like Affleck tho.
713474117815705600 2016-03-25 21:14:20 UTC <verygooster> So yeah I did not like most of Batman vs Superman to be honest.
713443976846708736 2016-03-25 19:14:33 UTC <verygooster> Also: "... You took me to see Batman Forever..." @JennaKil

712694582430011392 2016-03-23 17:36:44 UTC <verygooster> The thing I do have concern w/ whatever their gimmick for NX is that it will be squandered the way I felt the game pad possibilities were

709579312291258368 2016-03-14 03:17:46 UTC <verygooster> Yo where the eff is Paul Rhodes?
709547336347820034 2016-03-14 01:10:42 UTC <verygooster> Or World Famous Pizza or World Famous Ray's Pizza or 3 Famous Brothers from Italy Pizza
709547131787419648 2016-03-14 01:09:53 UTC <verygooster> All the pizzerias in The Division seem to be named just Pizzeria or Pizza as opposed to 3 Brothers from Italy or Ray's or something

709370884977516544 2016-03-14 13:29:33 UTC <verygooster> @DoubleUHarrison Somewhere into the second region the entire March Madness bracket leaked and spared us all two hours of commercials

709359055849000961 2016-03-14 12:42:32 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 yeah, like I don't mind loot hunting w people, and the Dark Zone stuff is okay. Might be better when dlc starts hitting
709358477911707648 2016-03-14 12:40:15 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 Basically, but Destiny has nicer looking armor/clothes. It's honestly okay if you're playing alone. Better w/ friends
709357989291909120 2016-03-14 12:38:18 UTC <verygooster> @rahxephon63 I blame The Division lol

709207920441958400 2016-03-13 02:41:59 UTC <verygooster> @ER_NoTR Right show is winning
709204359427596288 2016-03-13 02:27:50 UTC <verygooster> But it's also hilarious how serious this game takes itself a lot of the time.
709204263747121152 2016-03-13 02:27:27 UTC <verygooster> Yet I don't mind the loot hunting and stuff since I've been playing with friends.
709204045437739008 2016-03-13 02:26:35 UTC <verygooster> At lvl 21, The Division so far is another example of Ubisoft capable of designing a world but struggling to do anything meaningful with it.

702304270062919686 2016-02-23 01:29:20 UTC <verygooster> I liked that The Witch was 'straightforward,' to put it a certain way. I'm so used to horror now either subverting/dissecting tropes...

700433152142086144 2016-02-18 21:34:11 UTC <verygooster> And thats fine. Also back in 2003 Nick Nolte was hard to take seriously because of his dumb weird mugshot
700433057317326848 2016-02-18 21:33:48 UTC <verygooster> Also: I think Ang Lees Hulk had some good ideas/concepts in it, but nobody goes to Hulk movies for that.
