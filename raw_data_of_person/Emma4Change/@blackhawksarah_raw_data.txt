967181211276926976 2018-02-23 23:35:44 UTC <blackhawksarah> @DonaldJTrumpJr @FLOTUS @lauren_hoggs I'm so sorry this is happening to your family. The Trumps should all be ashamed of their behavior and lack of action/moral compass, but I don't think they know the meaning of the word. My love to you & your family. See you in the streets 3/24/18. #MarchForOurLives
967023515839934464 2018-02-23 13:09:07 UTC <blackhawksarah> @StephenKing @JShep33 No one is trying to take your guns. Calm down.
967022754770890754 2018-02-23 13:06:05 UTC <blackhawksarah> @marcorubio @StephenKing @Temocracy17 But it's also Governor Scott's job to be there and he didn't make an appearance. I get what Stephen was saying - they absolutely could have just not shown and been giant turds like Scott or Trump.
964641030095167489 2018-02-16 23:21:58 UTC <blackhawksarah> @SethTowerHurd When did I even say "literally zero?" You're just making shit up at this point. Go like your own tweets again and continuing shouting into your echo chamber. Pretty sure I'm the only one reading/reacting to your tweets anyway 
964638331786153985 2018-02-16 23:11:15 UTC <blackhawksarah> @SethTowerHurd "Mildly helped" me? You mean that one time you ordered like 1 dozen cupcakes? That's pretty self-righteous. Calm down bro.
964637147604103168 2018-02-16 23:06:32 UTC <blackhawksarah> @SethTowerHurd In a professional context? I barely know you, and I wasn't aware Twitter was the new linkdin but cool thanks.
964636753368879105 2018-02-16 23:04:58 UTC <blackhawksarah> @SethTowerHurd Have fun shouting into your echo chamber!
964636489039732737 2018-02-16 23:03:55 UTC <blackhawksarah> @SethTowerHurd Haha ok sorry you're so thin-skinned  maybe you shouldn't post controversial comments if you don't want to have an actual discussion. Good luck w your new company, Frank is super happy at Grainger so I don't think that would have been an issue anyway.
964290610042757120 2018-02-15 00:09:31 UTC <blackhawksarah> @SethTowerHurd Literally no one cares the number is inflated, wherever you got that stat - the problem is that there IS a number. Those numbers are human lives.
964290423970811905 2018-02-15 00:08:47 UTC <blackhawksarah> @SethTowerHurd Pretty sure you're missing the point. What number of kids killed by an AR15 is ok with you? My number is zero. Having semiautomatic weapons available for purchase to the general public is the problem here, no one is trying to take your guns.

963566788993867776 2018-02-13 00:13:19 UTC <blackhawksarah> @metraBNSF seriously, it feels like you know you have a monopoly and therefore just DO NOT GIVE A SHIT about anyone who has to deal with your (lack of) transportation. FUCK you, metra.

955440564270444545 2018-01-22 14:02:36 UTC <blackhawksarah> @metraBNSF Yeah, I complained both on your ventra app and tweeted at you about this with no reply. I will be calling also to complain. I've been late 4 out of the last 5 work days because of Metra, and you're going to RAISE the rates in a week? That's absolutely ridiculous.
955429433162289152 2018-01-22 13:18:22 UTC <blackhawksarah> @metraBNSF so you're gonna make us get off AGAIN and board on the middle track AGAIN? This is what we pay $200/mo for? #fuckmetrapic.twitter.com/vIF53FaLYd
955428872010551296 2018-01-22 13:16:08 UTC <blackhawksarah> Hey @metraBNSF I've been late 4 out of the last 5 business days. Does this mean my ticket next month will be 20% off? Oh no, that's right, you're INCREASING the rates for this terrific service.  #shadyaf #fuckmetra
932703836975828992 2017-11-20 20:14:58 UTC <blackhawksarah> Just learned that the MAGA campaign is now selling everyone's information. I wonder how much money Trump is making by sharing out the info of everyone who supports him?  #maketrumprichagain
