967175339779678209 2018-02-23 23:12:24 UTC <robmillernow> @nicharcourt Wow!  You rock!  Its my favorite of hers!
967082623485923329 2018-02-23 17:03:59 UTC <robmillernow> @nicharcourt Loving the set this morning -- that REM song Fall On Me really took me back.  I'd love to hear something sometime from Melissa Etheridge off of her second album, Brave And Crazy...
965298327410556929 2018-02-18 18:53:50 UTC <robmillernow> @deaconlightning Did you not read the first time when I wrote Bye now?
964918593019289600 2018-02-17 17:44:54 UTC <robmillernow> @deaconlightning And as you now have devolved into making absolutely ZERO sense, Ill just wish you a good day, k?  Bye now.
964710463886966784 2018-02-16 03:57:52 UTC <robmillernow> @deaconlightning "It's a 'gun problem?' Some new law will stop it? The NRA is responsible? All mass shooters are white? All gun owners are racist?"  Dunno where you got all that noise, but it wasn't from me -- I didn't say any of it.  Replying to the wrong tweet, perhaps?
964710161209204742 2018-02-16 03:56:40 UTC <robmillernow> @deaconlightning So, you "can't believe most of what is told by the media", but the media YOU rely on is 100% sure that "he is a Democrat voter"? I'm sure you'll present your unassailable source on that, AND video on these interviews that "say there were two shooters." You're all over the map.
964694412000247809 2018-02-16 02:54:05 UTC <robmillernow> @deaconlightning He is?  So which is it? a) "nobody still knows shit, can't believe most of what is told by the media, and can't believe jack shit from the cops" or b) "No. He is a Democrat"?  Pick a narrative and try to stick with it, because you don't get both.
964693634682531840 2018-02-16 02:51:00 UTC <robmillernow> @LAGTweetsMe We have separate laws for each state, which does no good. We need NATIONWIDE laws. No one but you has suggested "tak[ing] away the gun." Someone hellbent on stealing a car will find another means to achieve their goal -- that's no reason not to have strong car/driver safety laws.
964668512861011968 2018-02-16 01:11:10 UTC <robmillernow> @LAGTweetsMe IN YOUR STATE, you were "required to take classes ... and pass a background check."   Great.   Now once those laws are made national, we'll be starting to get somewhere.   Also, the reasoning that "some people will never follow" a law is no reason not to constantly improve laws.
964667575949864960 2018-02-16 01:07:27 UTC <robmillernow> @LAGTweetsMe AGAIN, you seem to not understand:  the existence/behavior of lawbreakers does not negate the need for laws.
964648683995217920 2018-02-16 23:52:23 UTC <robmillernow> @LAGTweetsMe Only those drivers who are law abiding will get licenses!  Great plan to get yourself killed or be injured by an unlicensed driver.
964648279756517376 2018-02-16 23:50:46 UTC <robmillernow> @deaconlightning You're contradicting yourself, John.   Today: "nobody still knows shit, can't believe most of what is told by the media"  Two days ago: "all indications are this was ISIS inspired and the shooter was a DEMOCRAT!"pic.twitter.com/qcaaSiUqNo
964404463459975168 2018-02-15 07:41:56 UTC <robmillernow> @LAGTweetsMe Chicago is also VERY near the state of Indiana, which has quite UN-strict gun laws.  We have federal standards for cars, despite the car thieves.  We need federal standards for guns, despite those "who is intent and capable of hurting someone doesnt care about laws".

964231988067446784 2018-02-15 20:16:35 UTC <robmillernow> @AlanTudyk @AlanGEskew I agree.  Have a great day.

964172188499652610 2018-02-15 16:18:57 UTC <robmillernow> @LAGTweetsMe "We have laws for gun ownership." Yes, and those laws need strengthening. We once didn't require seatbelts in every car. We changed that. "..think a criminal will disarm?" No more than a car thief will still steal & drive cars, but that doesn't mean abandoning ever-better safety.

964046156488613888 2018-02-14 07:58:09 UTC <robmillernow> @FoxNews @williamlegate @AliciaCurtin Wow.  And yet YOU are pointing fingers and using this as a political argument.   In the above tweet, I was referring to YOU:https://twitter.com/AliciaCurtin/status/964032530004537345
964045457721769984 2018-02-14 07:55:22 UTC <robmillernow> @TheLifeOfReed I've only seen THIS screenshot.  Have YOU a screenshot that proves YOUR point?pic.twitter.com/V5Cx5ZaK4c

964044677610594304 2018-02-14 07:52:16 UTC <robmillernow> @FoxNews @williamlegate @AliciaCurtin Yes, I agree, we should treat the causes. Among them: the kneejerk urge to feel that someone who thinks differently than you do (e.g. democrat) is somehow "less than," which leads to "otherizing" and that's not far from "demonizing." Easy blaming leads a society to easy violence.

947091449824317440 2017-12-30 13:06:12 UTC <robmillernow> @Delta See, its one thing to have to check a bag last minute.  Its ENTIRELY another thing to NEEDLESSLY check a bag into the viper pit called LAX.  The smartest person on your 2434 flight crew this morning said she agreed and said shed write it up as well.
947089625218256897 2017-12-30 12:58:57 UTC <robmillernow> @Delta @delta Thanks so much for starting the morning out crappy by making a BUNCH of passengers NEEDLESSLY check roll-aboards on DL2434, when the plane had TONS of room in it for carryons.  Is communication between the gate and the plane TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?

940646213052899328 2017-12-12 18:15:08 UTC <robmillernow> @VaughnHillyard Whats sad is that you cant spell theyre, yet youre telling people how to live their lives.  THIS IS WHY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING YOUR SHITTY RELIGION IN DROVES.  Your judgement does nothing but hasten your own demise.  Jesus would weep at what youve perverted his teachings into.
