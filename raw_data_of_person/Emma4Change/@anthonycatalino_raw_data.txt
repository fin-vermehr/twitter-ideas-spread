970472008210374656 2018-03-04 01:32:11 UTC <anthonycatalino> @squillace He reads the audiobook version of Call Me By Your Name, which is sort of strangely fitting because its Olivers voice reading Elios words, and in general is just divine.

969264085736022017 2018-03-01 17:32:20 UTC <anthonycatalino> @paulschwartzman Not one sentence of this surprises me.
968828388323586054 2018-02-28 12:41:02 UTC <anthonycatalino> I had a dream last night that @AngelOlsen put out a new album and @pitchfork gave it a 2.9. It was a nightmare, actually.

966544542085328898 2018-02-21 05:25:51 UTC <anthonycatalino> @cameron_kasky @MartinWiener Our brains are brilliantly designed. They allow us to feel joy during unspeakable pain if only so it does not destroy us. What strength there is in the resilience of the human mind. To face the worst of the world and still be able to smile.
966084635066281984 2018-02-20 22:58:20 UTC <anthonycatalino> Question: when does the millennial generation start/end? Im 15 years older than these amazing young high school activists, but I see the media calling them millennials, which is what I am. Mind is blown that were considered one and the same.
965981607197839360 2018-02-20 16:08:56 UTC <anthonycatalino> @brandonlgtaylor The ballyhooed beauty never refers to the onscreen bodies ???? CMBYN was full of Elios body, usually sans shirt in 5 swim trunks, and often sauntering across the frame or in repose, one leg up, beckoning.

959629406326198272 2018-02-02 03:27:34 UTC <anthonycatalino> @brandonlgtaylor Agree on Beloved, and agree on the efficacy of questioning the size. Maybe, the hardest thing I've encountered as a new writer is trying to figure out the scope within the story I'm writing, let alone if the thing I'm writing should actually be a story or, god forbid, a novel.
959628336648605696 2018-02-02 03:23:19 UTC <anthonycatalino> @brandonlgtaylor Currently reading The Monsters of Templeton. That shit is a NOVEL.
959626513346940928 2018-02-02 03:16:04 UTC <anthonycatalino> @brandonlgtaylor I struggle with this. Beloved is one beast of a novel that I (think) I would never want to be condensed to short story, but I can't even imagine what it would look like, so maybe I would. Is it 1 of the 10? Or Richard Ford, even when I want less Ford, I still love that I get more
959623903575453705 2018-02-02 03:05:42 UTC <anthonycatalino> Someday when you're stuck and think your art/passion/whatever is going nowhere, go back and read some of the album reviews on @pitchfork from the late 90s, early 2000s. Holy shit. You can do anything, kids.

956146184518762496 2018-01-24 12:46:29 UTC <anthonycatalino> @MrDanZak I was especially disappointed that he was not nominated. Im just finishing the novel, and having watched his monologue on YouTube while reading along (its nearly verbatim), its remarkable to watch the depth of feeling he puts into Acimans words.

940695258060468229 2017-12-12 21:30:01 UTC <anthonycatalino> I was looking at my Apple Music play count for songs released in 2017. Unsurprisingly, I listened to Frank Ocean's "Chanel" 64 times, nearly 3x more than the next most listened-to song. Far and away my favorite song of 2017.
