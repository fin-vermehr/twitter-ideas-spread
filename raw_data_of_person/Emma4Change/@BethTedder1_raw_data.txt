970401883981516801 2018-03-04 20:53:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's because we manufacture vehicles that are substandard to theirs.
968518021345173504 2018-02-27 16:07:45 UTC <BethTedder1> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Just wait.
967572299670056960 2018-02-24 01:29:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Dupree also said of other parents interviewed on CNN,  With two real children involved, it this were real, they would be real and would be with their children, consoling them, not promoting the New World Order agenda of total control, including the control of childrens minds.
967572042248802304 2018-02-24 01:28:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You retweet a scumbag who said On and before December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook was infested with espionage operatives. These operatives posed as the incredible, primarily parents."

966485015956807681 2018-02-21 01:29:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub Shulkin must resign.
966484589832212481 2018-02-21 01:27:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald Person to person sales should be ok but there should be a notarized bill of sale with the serial number. Actually, conscientious gun owners mostly do this. But stricter adherence or penalties for not getting one.
966482646653198336 2018-02-21 01:19:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald I think banning rifle magazines over 5 shots would take care of the majority of mass shootings. Federal buyback. Huge fed fine for possession. Crimestoppers rewards.

940752014484627457 2017-12-12 01:15:33 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And you're a vulgar pig.
940064528632385536 2017-12-10 03:43:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr The irony of the USA having a president named Trump is laughable to begin with but especially so since his offspring is even more laughable.
940061467591585792 2017-12-10 03:31:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @arvillove A shit stain.
939664265199472641 2017-12-09 01:13:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @RepSwalwell That's a mistranscription. He actually said "...primarily because of comics. I'm reading comics a lot."
939663485763489793 2017-12-09 01:10:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr There are no stories in favor of Trump.
939661408110829568 2017-12-09 01:01:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Yeah. Because Pelosi and Schumer won't allow pedophiles to sit.
939660939992928256 2017-12-09 01:00:00 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We can't wait until all your secrets are exposed following CNN's headline 'Breaking News'.

934835850462015488 2017-11-26 17:26:49 UTC <BethTedder1> @NormEisen 'Dodo-in-chief' is more reflective of Trump's emotional maturity. He'll understand it better.

Damn. There were EIGHT investigations by Republicans. They found nothing.
921511954983915522 2017-10-20 23:02:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh wow! Didn't you know? Barack Obama is no longer our President.
921508680608206848 2017-10-20 22:49:24 UTC <BethTedder1> John Kelly owes an apology to Rep. Wilson. He needs to meet with her and restore his honor because he impugned it yesterday.
921485603967062016 2017-10-20 21:17:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @politico This is sad. He has to be told how to vote by aides. His family should take charge.
921484978793472000 2017-10-20 21:15:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @MhlongoMax @speechboy71 One thing that struck me was Kelly said Trump asked him "What do I say?" Concerning that he should ask this if he's made these calls before?
921237587980775424 2017-10-19 04:52:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Who cares about stupid, fake, set-up, not-reality shows
921236438317875200 2017-10-19 04:47:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrhmp You call an intimate family friend of the deceased soldier 'wacky'? Yes, you are a fucking moron.
921236014202462208 2017-10-19 04:45:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Kelley stated today that you asked him 'What do I say?' before calling the widow. Are you that inept? Apparently so, since he also said he instructed you on what to say to her.
921235361409376256 2017-10-19 04:43:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump If it was so secret, why were both you and the widow on speakerphone?
921196301743804417 2017-10-19 02:08:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @chelseahandler PR thanks you with all their hearts and so do I.
921063021069455366 2017-10-19 17:18:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @804StreetMedia @USArmy333 Damage, that is.
921062653061189632 2017-10-19 17:17:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's because it's a fake story.
920854810819252225 2017-10-18 03:31:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @RepSwalwell I even posted on Facebook that I have a crush on you! (on your mind, of course)
920852779920478213 2017-10-18 03:23:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @Heritage @realDonaldTrump Racist haters.
920852636550787077 2017-10-18 03:22:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump More like hours, not days.
920852300612227073 2017-10-18 03:21:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Liar.
920852178071445505 2017-10-18 03:20:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Big liar.
920852129971097601 2017-10-18 03:20:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Liar.
920852058021953536 2017-10-18 03:20:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Liar.
920850969696636928 2017-10-18 03:15:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Regular people don't care about the stock market. We buy and sell on EBay, not Wall Street.
920849659177947141 2017-10-18 03:10:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump It is. 66% of Americans think you're inventing alternate truths aka LIES.
920443631596687360 2017-10-17 00:17:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump It worked quite well for my husband and myself.
920150515056545793 2017-10-16 04:52:33 UTC <BethTedder1> @jaketapper @ddale8 In other words, he hasn't a fucking clue.

920129599916429312 2017-10-16 03:29:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta First thing to do is stop saying 'misstating facts'. It's called lying. Willfully and wholeheartedly.

919566949948055552 2017-10-15 14:13:40 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Cancellations are not progress. They are regressive. They require no thought or process. They hurt our country and citizens. You are a complete failure as a president and a human being.
919224012470964224 2017-10-14 15:30:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @impeach_d_trump @boring_as_heck Ditto.

918969753452072960 2017-10-13 22:40:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They don't want you. They want food, water, medical care and power. You can go to hell as far as they are concerned.

917955882796900353 2017-10-10 03:31:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @Acosta Of course not. Trump does not know how to joke. All he knows are sarcastic insults.
917949725005045761 2017-10-10 03:07:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @BikiniRobotArmy @tasker2003 I wish I could delete him. Permanently.
917948988032258049 2017-10-10 03:04:28 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Why would you fire him? He is more likely to resign in disgust.

917829795567800320 2017-10-10 19:10:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @IsraelUSAforevr Retweeting another bot. How about that free MENSA test?
917829366947696641 2017-10-10 19:09:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Mensa has offered for you to compete free on an IQ test with Tillerson. I'm sure Corker would agree also. Put up or shut up.

917775167744610305 2017-10-10 15:33:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Promoting a for-profit product is a violation of 5 CFR 2635.702 - Use of public office for private gain.
917773523745148928 2017-10-10 15:27:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The Moron speaks gibberish.

917375665229434880 2017-10-09 13:06:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @AriFleischer No they haven't. He has a right to leave. They are appalled that the whole thing was a set-up. Trump verified it.
917374713428697090 2017-10-09 13:02:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They only started acting like real asses after you came along.

917196260574220288 2017-10-08 01:13:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @nypost @realDonaldTrump I understand you really need it for your legal defense.
917110575750139905 2017-10-08 19:32:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @KazmierskiR @DonaldJTrumpJr @hirsh123 It means confidential. Not classified.
917109741914075144 2017-10-08 19:29:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Gen. Kelly's phone was compromised. So where is it now? Is it still active? Accessible? Or perhaps it would be best to destroy it.
917107571739320320 2017-10-08 19:20:58 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @Jhorecky @molly_knight But you're ok with disrespecting the disabled, veterans, mayors, women, senators, poor, congresspeople, LGBTQ's, Latinos? ALL AMERICANS!
917103398444589056 2017-10-08 19:04:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr I support his right to leave just as I support their right to kneel.
917102767801536512 2017-10-08 19:01:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @SecondLady @VP @realDonaldTrump Taking credit, huh?
917094843939254272 2017-10-08 18:30:24 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @VP I fight for your right to walk out the same as I fight for their right to kneel.
917057731097452544 2017-10-08 16:02:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit.
917057462120919040 2017-10-08 16:01:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Your endorsement is the kiss of death now. Who would want it?
917056351485952001 2017-10-08 15:57:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueCPI Not if they're running for re-election.
916820378521161728 2017-10-07 00:19:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub I can't. Reached my limit. :(
916819003913490432 2017-10-07 00:14:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Do you not realize that 95% of your positive Twitter supporters are bots?
916759359354437632 2017-10-07 20:17:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Why the FUCK do you keep saying shit like that?!? Do you enjoy scaring the crap out of us? Do you enjoy making us sick daily?!?
916655004483817472 2017-10-07 13:22:38 UTC <BethTedder1> @RonaldLorenzen1 @realDonaldTrump @drhelldigger Only about 25%. The other 75% want it and want it better.
916654661188407296 2017-10-07 13:21:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump When are you going to tweet about the job loss?
916654407219019777 2017-10-07 13:20:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump Campaign. Campaign. Campaign. The campaign was over a year ago. Move the fuck on.
916654086195417088 2017-10-07 13:18:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Republicans are decidedly unfunny. That's why there are so few.
916653559999025153 2017-10-07 13:16:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Paris Dennard likes you. LOL.
916653190912921601 2017-10-07 13:15:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Funny. I watch @CNN and I see identified Republicans on there all day. Most of them abhor you.
916139714364702720 2017-10-05 03:15:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub Perhaps staff should take a hammer to it to prevent further security breach.  *snicker*
916128978808856576 2017-10-05 02:32:24 UTC <BethTedder1> @ComfortablySmug Dying laughing!!!

916128229680967680 2017-10-05 02:29:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @Lovebugaboo I don't know how much longer I can take this turmoil. I certainly can't take it for three more years. :(
916127512836616192 2017-10-05 02:26:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump He should sue you for saying that.
916127129292693504 2017-10-05 02:25:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @Lovebugaboo My stomach hurts. Again.

916074052669837312 2017-10-05 22:54:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump Damn it, just STOP IT! Stop embarrassing yourself and your administration and your cabinet and your country. Get some mental help!
916072200683352064 2017-10-05 22:46:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump And your word is believable? Pardon me while I laugh my ass off.
915822015608745984 2017-10-04 06:12:38 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You're getting BORING. Same tweets over and over. Can't you come up with something different? How about calling Theresa May a fat cow?
915821294884671489 2017-10-04 06:09:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Yep. Fake News reported a hurricane hitting Puerto Rico. What BS! How dare they? Faked video too!
915820326470258688 2017-10-04 06:05:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Did you tell them to have a good time?
915819566638432256 2017-10-04 06:02:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @SpeakerRyan @politico He'll be resigning. Probably tomorrow or Friday.
915819183543390208 2017-10-04 06:01:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @CNN @Hope012015 He has one reason. Obama did it. That's the only reason important to him.
915750621248200704 2017-10-04 01:28:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @Larrylamb11E @RedTRaccoon Anyone who pulls out a gun in public without intending to use it is an ignorant, gun-illiterate fool. All he had to do was pat his pocket.
915749115841187840 2017-10-04 01:22:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @Fahrenthold @kylegriffin1 He should just go ahead and resign. Probably will within a few days.
915748546867064834 2017-10-04 01:20:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @kylegriffin1 Glad to see his heart is heavy with thoughts of what he plans to say.
915748199696084992 2017-10-04 01:19:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub Excellent story of investigative journalism. Good work.
915737842239852545 2017-10-04 00:38:09 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @kurteichenwald Interesting that Trump has over 35 million followers yet struggles to reach 100,000 likes on his tweets. Most often, much less than that.
915407240265392128 2017-10-03 02:44:28 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @RogueCPI Hard.
915371848346546176 2017-10-03 00:23:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And he could have killed plenty more but he offed himself.
915371678468857858 2017-10-03 00:23:09 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The broken window glass probably gave them a hint.
915327981899456512 2017-10-03 21:29:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @davidaxelrod Here. Catch this roll of paper towels.
915327779117436929 2017-10-03 21:28:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We are not proud of you. You are the biggest embarrassment this country has ever seen.

914632971231080454 2017-10-01 23:27:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump If you start a nuclear war, your life won't be worth a nickle. To anyone. To any country. Not even to your family. Let that sink in.
914631956331159552 2017-10-01 23:23:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @davidaxelrod He gets bored with his sh*t-stirring on one subject and excites himself by starting another.
914307121856094208 2017-09-30 01:52:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @amazon @ShaunKing @nixter36 Absolutely. That was our donations to Harvey relief Tampons and adult diapers.
914285341699399681 2017-09-30 00:26:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Someone please, for the country's sake, rip his phone out of his hand and shove it up his ass all the way to their elbow.
914281946519343104 2017-09-30 00:12:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueCPI I don't know how well he is. But he is a fucking bastard asshole.
914270474993008640 2017-09-30 23:27:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The People of Puerto Rico can't hear you. They have no power, internet, phone service or running water.

913806812419362818 2017-09-29 16:44:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And what decisions might that be? Just rebuild it like we would any other state in this country.
913599791011127297 2017-09-28 03:02:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You have had no effect on this.
913582896379809792 2017-09-28 01:55:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman Are they going to pay for Price's private jet trips?
913562691754749952 2017-09-28 00:34:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Fire Price. But make him fully reimburse first.
913552371929767936 2017-09-28 23:53:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are a failure! You won't win this one either.

913030912262180864 2017-09-27 13:21:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump A pathetic attempt at trying to show us you are not a racist loser.

912673849048739843 2017-09-26 13:42:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump I think we should have a regulation that fines the President $1,000,000 every time he says a word that media must bleep.
912496806705139713 2017-09-25 01:59:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @jayMAGA45 Tillman would have taken a knee against you. He would have despised you. Shows exactly how much you know.
912496199718113281 2017-09-25 01:57:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit. He's so pissed at you he can't see straight.
912495851959971840 2017-09-25 01:55:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Uh. No.
912131116542414849 2017-09-24 01:46:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You lose. Again. No, we're not tired of winning yet. Anytime you lose, we win. We love winning!
912130323583991808 2017-09-24 01:43:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And you should shut up about it and do your job. Which does not involve the NFL. They don't want your opinions or your threats.
912039038726615040 2017-09-24 19:40:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The solidarity is against you...you fucking asshole.

912036283664551937 2017-09-24 19:29:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump How does it feel for around 65% of the citizens  of this country to alternately laugh at you and hate you?
911665570977902593 2017-09-23 18:56:24 UTC <BethTedder1> @PreetBharara @waltshaub I am excited for both of you! Can't wait. I'll love CNN even more now. Of course I loved it when they fired that annoying Jeffrey Lord.
910513362357882880 2017-09-20 14:37:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @davidaxelrod Actually, it made sense either way so you get a pass.
910362751087906816 2017-09-19 04:39:28 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They were too polite to boo you.
910362343997046785 2017-09-19 04:37:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And you never won one.
910269574188322816 2017-09-19 22:29:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @USUN @UN_Spokesperson @UN @realDonaldTrump It's just a club where people talk and hang out. Your speech means nothing. Really.
910250126131810304 2017-09-19 21:11:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @maggieNYT I thought of that too! Someone told him. Someone who had an inside track. Someone like Guiliani?
910225153237426176 2017-09-19 19:32:42 UTC <BethTedder1> He is threatening to destroy an entire country of 35 million people because of one man. Fuck him.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/910192375267561472
910200975255842816 2017-09-19 17:56:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @GlennThrush And his loyal followers may have helped him change his mind. Because we're loyal like that

909850060254478337 2017-09-18 18:42:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @Fahrenthold @achillesintl must be more about currying favor with Trump than about standing behind the disabled. Maybe they should lose donations.

908906989790605312 2017-09-15 04:14:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @Fahrenthold @AP @NattyJPuffinton @Jhorecky @dabeard @l_burcher @Teri70487630 I have no link. David Fahrenthold reports each confirmation on Twitter. He checks with each charity  to see when they report receipt.

908862994066608129 2017-09-15 01:19:58 UTC <BethTedder1> @AdavNoti @waltshaub I can't like. Instead I'll Grrrrrrr!
908851666388230144 2017-09-15 00:34:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @slopholepounder @thecuttman @CaucasionKing Not really. Mostly related to intelligence.
908849758156070912 2017-09-15 00:27:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @slopholepounder @thecuttman @CaucasionKing I would never pick on someone purely because of their coloring. Spelling...yes. Color...no.
908846770528104448 2017-09-15 00:15:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @slopholepounder @CaucasionKing @thecuttman Maybe he was actually misspelling confusion.
908845636367392769 2017-09-15 00:10:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @CharlesMBlow My boobs are letting me down. They've fallen and they can't get up.
908845313905053696 2017-09-15 00:09:43 UTC <BethTedder1> Speaking from personal experience, I have zero confidence in boobs. They always eventually fall down and can't get up.https://twitter.com/AliveInPhilly/status/908776278131712001
908842778733445120 2017-09-15 23:59:38 UTC <BethTedder1> @Fahrenthold @AP @NattyJPuffinton @Jhorecky @dabeard He's paid $50,000 now. $25,000 each to Direct Relief and Habitat for Humanity. Only $950,000 to go!
908811134907625476 2017-09-15 21:53:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @seanbarakett Sort of.
908810967559102464 2017-09-15 21:53:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @thecuttman @slopholepounder No silly. I equated an expressed desire to cook Jews with an expressed desire to fuck children. But both can change. Right?
908810496941461504 2017-09-15 21:51:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @seanbarakett Let's gas all UCF grads. Because I think they're worthless sub-human garbage. LOL!!  Oh wait. That was a joke. Sort of.
908809600442519553 2017-09-15 21:47:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @thecuttman @slopholepounder Do child molesters get a free pass after 4 years? Because they 'change'?
908808638021668864 2017-09-15 21:43:58 UTC <BethTedder1> @stevenmnuchin1 @JakeSherman There's that disgusting hubris again.
908808315802722305 2017-09-15 21:42:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump NOW you say something presidential-calibre after tweeting your normal crap earlier today. But too late. Your initial reaction was more true.
908769577806548993 2017-09-15 19:08:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Like John McCain?
908744960647860224 2017-09-15 17:30:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @NatlParkService @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @Mrtimrock @BarefootRockU Says me. Every single day. And my family. And my friends.
908744165097435136 2017-09-15 17:27:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @SenWarren If they have a CDL, then there is no issue. If not, then they should be capable of passing the test. Again, no issue.
908737605382103040 2017-09-15 17:01:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @SenWarren Speaking as a liberal truck-driver' s wife.
908736760468922369 2017-09-15 16:58:21 UTC <BethTedder1> @SenWarren Not necessarily. Driving a truck on a six-lane interstate is a little different than driving on a dirt road.
908727995791286272 2017-09-15 16:23:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @CREWcrew Damn!!!!!

908708686520078337 2017-09-15 15:06:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @CREWcrew @NoahBookbinder Waiting with bated breath!
908694206058778625 2017-09-15 14:09:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump It would also not be legal. But of course, you don't know that. Or care. Or can be taught.
908693838117654533 2017-09-15 14:07:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Who spit in your Cheerios this morning?
908693515223420929 2017-09-15 14:06:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit.
908693415298322433 2017-09-15 14:06:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit.
908692543654768640 2017-09-15 14:02:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Cut off internet?
908692292877389824 2017-09-15 14:01:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's to keep them from passing stupid legislation.
908413770615197696 2017-09-14 19:34:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump ???????
908413382721753090 2017-09-14 19:33:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are the curse.
908413264983453696 2017-09-14 19:32:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit.
908413085131657218 2017-09-14 19:32:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No, it won't. You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.
908339812071088129 2017-09-14 14:41:01 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @deepknight @DrCheddar04 So far $25,000 is all. To Direct Relief. Only $975,000 to go.
908339291385987072 2017-09-14 14:38:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And a few rounds of golf?
908339139548008449 2017-09-14 14:38:21 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Just you. And your entire administration. And the Republican House and Senate. And your 33% base. No one else.
908338990998269952 2017-09-14 14:37:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Just you. And your entire administration. And the Republican House and Senate. And your 33% base. No one else.
908186805761167360 2017-09-13 04:33:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub He could have used one of Hillary's old cellphones. Or her email server. Turns out they are pretty secure.
908185428351766528 2017-09-13 04:27:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @JulieS604 You forgot intelligence.
908177852243292160 2017-09-13 03:57:27 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @jackiebwatson Or in the Caymans.
908177537670549504 2017-09-13 03:56:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump So you think we should copy China's tax laws. Really? Anything else idiotic to say? Like 'America First'? Or 'America Should Be Like China'?
908175417135255554 2017-09-13 03:47:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald Big smile at that!
908175050519564289 2017-09-13 03:46:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You know, you might be a better President if you would focus on your job and stop whining about what Clinton is doing. Give. It. Up.

908019365592870924 2017-09-13 17:27:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No. We need to raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for Irma and Harvey.
908018943293607936 2017-09-13 17:26:00 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Don't they have to write a bill first?
907615012683907077 2017-09-12 14:40:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @washingtonpost This guy is a fruitcake. Why would any government entity even give him the time of day?
907595628066349057 2017-09-12 13:23:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Of course, because you are such a secretive and media-reticent person. They can only imagine what you are like.

907345423748255744 2017-09-11 20:49:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @linmp1031 So many. The older we get the more we lose. Tears. But there is always a new baby needing a home.
907343576350298112 2017-09-11 20:42:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @linmp1031 I lost my first tux, Gypsy, after 18 years. Adopted Murphy 3 yrs ago. He's a nut! I've had five or six others, but those are the only tuxes.
907336001575690240 2017-09-11 20:12:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @linmp1031 Blk and white kitties (tuxedo) are the best and smartest ever.

906518737813213184 2017-09-09 14:04:44 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No, they should'nt. They made a choice to be tax-exempt and exist on donations therefore they made a choice not to accept public tax money

905431946896998402 2017-09-06 14:06:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump But Sessions said it was illegal  does that mean you will continue it even if it is illegal? You are personification of Jekyll/Hyde.
905431409396994049 2017-09-06 14:04:04 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No, we are not. No matter how many times you repeat it, it is still a lie.
905193626417987585 2017-09-05 22:19:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You couldn't care less. We know that.

904541682863144960 2017-09-03 03:08:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @ChelseaClinton @RogueCPI I prayed for him to die. And I'm not ashamed to say it.
904540837220159488 2017-09-03 03:05:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub He's a sadist. Cruel. Despicable. The DACA kids I know are terrified.

901826689919004673 2017-08-27 15:20:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That would be several years from now.
901826425132638210 2017-08-27 15:19:09 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Many people or some people? And are those different people or the same people?

901116294291914752 2017-08-25 16:17:21 UTC <BethTedder1> @StephenKing It's too difficult for him to understand. He sticks to cartoons for entertainment.

900718982881312768 2017-08-24 13:58:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Republicans just can't seem to understand that Americans by far now LIKE Obamacare. They are still living in the past.

900703451713331200 2017-08-24 12:56:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's because there is no chance you have any clue how it works. Government.
900702993024245761 2017-08-24 12:55:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Only because 'their' schizophrenic speeches from a schizophrenic man.

900214165574430721 2017-08-22 04:32:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @davidaxelrod He was so annoying!
900213859545473025 2017-08-22 04:31:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueCPI I have no more words to describe him. I think the worst of the worst have been spoken tonight.

900030799466160128 2017-08-22 16:23:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio Barron could have read the speech out loud and he would have been more expressive and believable. Actually a dead person could have also.
899866560269090816 2017-08-21 05:31:21 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta @ItsYorgi Then why bother with the tweets and speech? Just do it.
899866329422974976 2017-08-21 05:30:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta @craigblanton As soon as one of Trumps generals gets to a phone to call them.
899866021460414464 2017-08-21 05:29:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta @jimmyniner1868 Then why the speech, twitter announcement, etc? Why not just do it?

895835761244766208 2017-08-10 02:34:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @CornellWBrooks @AC360 The redhead was extremely annoying and rude. Eye rolling, smirking, looking to the 'heavens'...get rid of her forever.

890208614270611457 2017-07-26 13:54:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Drain the cesspool. Fire the President.
890208224552648705 2017-07-26 13:52:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Stop trolling and FIRE him if you're going to. You are such a wuss. Just DO it!
890199986272690176 2017-07-26 13:19:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Does that include  Commander-in-Chief with a micropenis?
890194543001391104 2017-07-26 12:58:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Socks with sandals?
890194281167593472 2017-07-26 12:57:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You to continue to be President?
890188688621273088 2017-07-26 12:34:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @WhiteHouse @saadhariri @realDonaldTrump And your ignorance of his government shone. He even smirked at you.
890188291835916288 2017-07-26 12:33:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We don't believe you. You lie about everything.
890188133475782657 2017-07-26 12:32:44 UTC <BethTedder1> @lisamurkowski @realDonaldTrump The only person letting the country down is you.
889982958093914112 2017-07-25 22:57:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Are you going to pardon Barron?
889981906481278976 2017-07-25 22:53:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Can you tell us exactly why you are even there? Why campaigning instead of governing?
889980922241712130 2017-07-25 22:49:21 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueFirstLady How are you feeling about the Donald's tweeting about your son? Are you going to give him a time-out?
889956269917970440 2017-07-25 21:11:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @davidaxelrod He just wants to sign something. Anything. Good or bad. Cause he's a winner.
889865697743994881 2017-07-25 15:11:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @rmasher2 Hope he votes no.
889865419695194113 2017-07-25 15:10:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @votevets Do it.
889864830420746241 2017-07-25 15:08:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @PreetBharara Agree.
889832241131552769 2017-07-25 12:58:33 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Giving a political rally speech to the Big Brothers and Big Sisters meeting?
889831957705764865 2017-07-25 12:57:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Lie.
889831818563907584 2017-07-25 12:56:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Use your own son for a sick political joke. Go ahead. That sets a precedent. Now we can use him for our sick political jokes too.
889831208984731649 2017-07-25 12:54:27 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump He's not a hero. He was captured.
889831094639579136 2017-07-25 12:53:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Betcha he votes no.
889830978230812672 2017-07-25 12:53:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump As if you really care what is in the bill. All you want is something to sign. Nothing more. Nothing less.
889830812048404480 2017-07-25 12:52:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump As if you really care what is in the bill. All you want is something to sign. Nothing more. Nothing less.
889830487061123072 2017-07-25 12:51:35 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump So youre going to hire someone who donated to you instead? Whats the difference?
889702757921427456 2017-07-24 04:24:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @GlennKesslerWP @adamentous He heard about the story from some people. Didn't read it himself. Has no idea. As usual.
889683455847657478 2017-07-24 03:07:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump What I heard today was an abomination speaking to the Scouts. Children being used as political pawns in a sick game by a sick man.

889633175777009666 2017-07-24 23:47:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @carol_NC66 @RepAdamSchiff He is a vindictive, irresponsible, incompetent and juvenile little man. He is not worthy to stand in the same room as you.
889562291603165184 2017-07-24 19:05:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They are bigger failures than you. You can't even be a winner at failing.
889561781936541696 2017-07-24 19:03:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Maybe because she didn't break the law?
889295287629615105 2017-07-23 01:24:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump For someone who has 34 million followers why do you get so few likes?
889294046841241602 2017-07-23 01:19:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Sounds like an empty threat.
889293600395231233 2017-07-23 01:18:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Such a precedential tweet. From the Twit-er-in-Chief.
889293248027602944 2017-07-23 01:16:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump So how is it that Democrats are the obstructionists then?
889292511289716736 2017-07-23 01:13:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump How much did that cost you?
889221184235196418 2017-07-23 20:30:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @jaketapper On their knees, of course.
889220755061452801 2017-07-23 20:28:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Whines the Twit-er-in-Chief...
889220023788740609 2017-07-23 20:25:49 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We're waiting on your next tweet...
889219693961236480 2017-07-23 20:24:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Poor Donald. Disloyalty sucks, doesn't it?
889217778732986370 2017-07-23 20:16:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump WTF? Are you drunk-tweeting?
889217118876696576 2017-07-23 20:14:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Take your meds.
889188124533948417 2017-07-23 18:19:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @Scaramucci You've gotten into a bed full of fleas. You're already scratching.
888972433130225664 2017-07-22 04:01:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And how's that working?
888971787924631552 2017-07-22 03:59:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No. Many people couldn't care less because she did not break any laws. Unlike you and your entire administration.
888589225930756096 2017-07-21 02:39:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The President's tweet speaks for itself. Code for he's an idiot and I have no way to defend him.
888279040188010496 2017-07-20 06:06:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @smilexgratitude And we LOVE how Mrs. Abe pretended not to speak English so she would not have to talk to idiot Trump at the G20 dinner. Priceless!!!
888278638990311424 2017-07-20 06:05:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @smilexgratitude And we normal Americans feel the same about you!
888176139533004801 2017-07-20 23:17:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueFirstLady A hero. And a zero.
888175188680089600 2017-07-20 23:14:01 UTC <BethTedder1> @nyulaw @PreetBharara Enjoy your tweets, sir. Good sense of humor!
888174192939716609 2017-07-20 23:10:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We do. We just don't believe in you.
887759219361021952 2017-07-19 19:41:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Hold your breath, please.
887759017988304896 2017-07-19 19:40:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Their plans suck. So what is YOUR plan. Have never heard you discuss it.
887421771166699521 2017-07-18 21:20:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No, you said we would have a big, beautiful new plan that would insure everyone with great coverage. Where is that plan?
887421331326869504 2017-07-18 21:18:27 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump So you have given up on this year? Aw poor baby. Being President with no winning is disheartening, isn't it?
887420257467600898 2017-07-18 21:14:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Doesn't mean sh*t to me. I just need to pay my past due Dr. Bills.
887292834872741888 2017-07-18 12:47:51 UTC <BethTedder1> Can we go ahead and repeal Donald and figure out his replacement in the next two years?
887290672587436032 2017-07-18 12:39:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @ananavarro Don't worry about it. Few do.
887290005227544576 2017-07-18 12:36:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald Trump doesn't know which Ivanka shoe goes on which foot.
887289635134722048 2017-07-18 12:35:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Your desperation is showing.
887289070602387456 2017-07-18 12:32:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Of course. Screw the American people. As long as you WIN, nothing else matters.
887284961115504641 2017-07-18 12:16:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump President Obama worked his butt off getting the ACA. You gave done nothing but spout and play golf.No wonder the new plan is a grand failure
887143194709905408 2017-07-17 02:53:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @Larrylamb11E @jimsciutto Really.

887139438568058880 2017-07-17 02:38:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @politico What kind of poor souls in this country actually think he is doing a good job?
887137002256310276 2017-07-17 02:28:38 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump In case you didn't know, you are a Republican too. What have you done about it? Nothing but threaten and insult. How's that working for you?
887136153689882624 2017-07-17 02:25:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They couldn't find their asses with both hands. Dems want no part of their current clusterf**k. Or the WH clusterf**k extraordinaire.
887099980510633985 2017-07-17 00:01:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @WhiteHouse @POTUS And not a single Trump brand.
887015441905967106 2017-07-17 18:25:35 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Your ignorance of politics is in full view to the world. Why continue to advertise it?
886764417433702400 2017-07-16 01:48:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump When? After you recover for three or four days from your traveling. I know how hard it is on an old man.
886591765104533504 2017-07-16 14:22:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump How come you have over 38 million followers and barely ever get 10% likes?
886590823793610752 2017-07-16 14:18:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Is his check in the mail?
886590722681569280 2017-07-16 14:17:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump It was about women's golf, not you, you dolt.
886388957487013889 2017-07-15 00:56:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The fastest since 2014. Woopty doo wow.
886342353790935040 2017-07-15 21:50:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @AKADonaldTrump They hate him because he's gay.
886341443828297729 2017-07-15 21:47:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And the Trump name credibility  hit an all time low.

885925088519913472 2017-07-14 18:12:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @PeterBeinart @julialillie In his case pretty much everything he says is projection.
885924664765231104 2017-07-14 18:11:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueSNRadvisor Yeah. Kind of like the Berlin Wall.
885923395501740033 2017-07-14 18:06:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump He is as transparent as a brick wall. And just as intelligent.
885922995839148036 2017-07-14 18:04:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @calvinstowell @altun_diyar Tournament officials asked him not to attend. They said it would be too disruptive.
885922625788293120 2017-07-14 18:03:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They asked you not to attend.
885903829589532672 2017-07-14 16:48:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Ha ha ha ha!!!!
885680331029979137 2017-07-13 02:00:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @votevets Junior is 39. Emmanel Macron is 39.
885594481126518784 2017-07-13 20:19:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @CNNSitRoom @Acosta Pun intended :)
885337281715998721 2017-07-12 03:17:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That'll cover what...about 50 miles of wall? HA! Big win my ass.
885322580936327169 2017-07-12 02:18:46 UTC <BethTedder1> Shouldn't there be video or record of Natalia Veselnitskaya entering and leaving Trump Tower? Just to check how long she was really there?

885318934391660546 2017-07-12 02:04:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @Scavino45 Yawn.

885147757182320640 2017-07-12 14:44:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Very similar to "All my friends are doing it so why can't I"

885144726122487813 2017-07-12 14:32:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Yeah but all that is fake news. This is real news.
884939889053233153 2017-07-11 00:58:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @jaketapper @EricTrump Yeah, your dad and sister Ivanka are obviously very, very close. You and Don, second fiddles.
884907512528588800 2017-07-11 22:49:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @limbaugh @DonaldJTrumpJr @MedianPolitics DTjr. You said if a Republican did this Dems would be calling for the electric chair. You are a Repub. You did it. ELECTRIC CHAIR!!

884832840059367424 2017-07-11 17:52:43 UTC <BethTedder1> It's so funny how @realDonaldTrump defends @IvankaTrump over shoes yet leaves @DonaldJTrumpJr  to twist in the wind.
884772901844652033 2017-07-11 13:54:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr You made a really stupid mistake, for which you and your father will pay. Get used to it. Get ready. You lawyered up which proves it.

884489388587180035 2017-07-10 19:07:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @carol_NC66 West Coast elite. Hollywood elite. LOL
884489064405184512 2017-07-10 19:06:40 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @RoguePOTUSStaff @Ninkurra I stand corrected.
884477450843021312 2017-07-10 18:20:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff I doubt the word 'adoption' was even spoken during the meeting.
884405129407025152 2017-07-10 13:33:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump So, it was ok for Ivanka to hold your seat while you gave our country away.
884404869003661313 2017-07-10 13:32:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They don't care. That's why. Where is YOUR big, beautiful plan?
884404584864731136 2017-07-10 13:30:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods Why would you retweet something from a Hollywood elite? You hate them.
884404307411578881 2017-07-10 13:29:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Why would you even entertain or discuss something so treasonous and absurd? Oh, yeah. Never mind.
884403903407771648 2017-07-10 13:28:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No thanks to Jordan, of course.
884403737057472512 2017-07-10 13:27:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And for years they had no plan. And still don't.
884403542873837568 2017-07-10 13:26:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Then you were derelict in your duty if you did not discuss sanctions.
884096724054290432 2017-07-09 17:07:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That cease-fire has been in the works  through Jordan and Russia. Not through you.
884095774358990850 2017-07-09 17:03:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And why the hell not?!?!
884095562601156611 2017-07-09 17:03:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Why was Putin asking this and why was it any of his business?
884095134270447618 2017-07-09 17:01:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Joint statement Oct. 7, 2016 from DNI Director Clapper and DHS Secretary Johnson spoke on behalf of the USIC which includes all 17 agencies.
884089707218567172 2017-07-09 16:39:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Putin:          . Trump: OK
883835056896319493 2017-07-08 23:47:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Ok, so what was the outcome of your meeting?
883482167233441792 2017-07-07 00:25:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @VP No he isn't.  He's too busy tweeting stupid stuff about John Podesta.
883464406922932224 2017-07-07 23:15:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @RepAdamSchiff Oh. Hell. No.
883463941199941636 2017-07-07 23:13:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @AndrzejDuda No. THIS is fake news.pic.twitter.com/b43BWqbVOE
883463703559057412 2017-07-07 23:12:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @JoeNBC Lordy, I hope there are tapes.
883431121211535360 2017-07-07 21:02:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @jimsciutto No. Believe nothing.
883416479261216770 2017-07-07 20:04:36 UTC <BethTedder1> It's getting pretty bad when you believe Russia's version of the meeting over the U.S. version.
883415607777124353 2017-07-07 20:01:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @chrislhayes Believe nothing.
883415104750067712 2017-07-07 19:59:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @Malala Hello Malala!
883335175442022400 2017-07-07 14:41:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No one there cares about that. No one there is talking about it. Are you bored or something?
883334288460189697 2017-07-07 14:38:00 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Angela Merkel thinks you are a buffoon.
883333035772567553 2017-07-07 14:33:01 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump I mean lack of competence. Duh.
883332708948168704 2017-07-07 14:31:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @idarakeldar He just has to keep shoving it in our faces!
883332236698955776 2017-07-07 14:29:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Your juvenile attitude and lack of incompetence is showing again.
882582558340415488 2017-07-05 12:50:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You sure give up easily. But who knew diplomacy was hard.
882581781421195264 2017-07-05 12:47:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump I know you are so excited to meet Putin. Of course you said you already met him. Which is true? Or do you even know? Or care?
882581149813551105 2017-07-05 12:45:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You have no conception of what helps us or hurts us. Sheer ignorance.
882580778336620544 2017-07-05 12:43:49 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump I thought you were a dealmaker. Looks more like you are a failure.
882441718326546433 2017-07-04 03:31:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @McFaul @maggieNYT @stevenleemyers There are way too many big words and concepts in there for Trump to understand. He would never get past the first sentence.

881853450522374145 2017-07-03 12:33:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Wages will go up when you raise the minimum wage.
881349273002139649 2017-07-01 03:10:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Correct. It is Presidential. It's just that you are not.
881196330068180993 2017-07-01 17:02:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @JustinTrudeau @realDonaldTrump He can't stand you. He thinks you are a buffoon.

881156731245666304 2017-07-01 14:25:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Doesn't Twitter have a policy about users abusing other users?

876058870354989056 2017-06-17 12:48:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff And most of those despise him but want to see what crap he posts.
876057528471347200 2017-06-17 12:42:45 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You have no friends.

848978171290628096 2017-04-03 19:19:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta It was an odd amount. Less than three months and more than two.

842376988413308929 2017-03-16 14:08:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta I think he did. He is just not angry enough that it surfaced. And Jr.  has done nothing but crow about it.
842121712468647943 2017-03-15 21:13:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump No, real news. Fake tax returns you leaked to press pretending you actually paid taxes.
842120258190204928 2017-03-15 21:08:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff I agree. He's not mad enough for someone else to have leaked them.

839486747050409984 2017-03-08 14:43:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Then why do you treat your wife like crap in public? We see you. No respect at all.
839268846481600514 2017-03-07 00:17:40 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You lie.
839259149171056640 2017-03-07 23:39:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @jaketapper At what point does the deepening lack of credibility of our President reach a complete inability for him to govern our country?
839124124735799297 2017-03-07 14:42:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff This has to stop. The country is in chaos because of this mentally ill man.
839121955605315585 2017-03-07 14:33:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The news isn't telling us. Your Administration is. Are they 'fake staff'?
838543080949178368 2017-03-05 00:13:44 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff He's not emotionally or mentally equipped to deal with this kind of pressure. He's on overload.
838529690864402432 2017-03-05 23:20:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff I think he is livid because Sessions was his insurance policy within the Justice Department.

837707421187469313 2017-03-03 16:53:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Like you read an actual book. Liar. Fake story.
837706678707621888 2017-03-03 16:50:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump What's pathetic is you have not nominated anyone for a tenth of the offices you need to fill. What is your problem?
837496563463294976 2017-03-02 02:55:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Sessions lied. Lied. Lied. Lied. And you nominated a liar.
837495225446723585 2017-03-02 02:49:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Your cabinet is incompetent. Your advisors are incompetent. Every aspect of your 'so-called' presidency is incompetent.
837305353880600576 2017-03-02 14:15:27 UTC <BethTedder1> @CharlesMBlow It happens more often than anyone thinks. Grief, familiarity, consolation, shared memories, provide comfort to both.

837153608974151680 2017-03-01 04:12:28 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta Yes. Sessions must resign.
837152773007376386 2017-03-01 04:09:09 UTC <BethTedder1> Jeff Sessions must resign.
836964009219874816 2017-03-01 15:39:04 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff It's tongue-in-cheek...
836748498322227201 2017-02-28 01:22:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueSNRadvisor Is he calling Central Casting again?
836745189075070978 2017-02-28 01:09:33 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff No offense, but I don't think anyone in their right mind thinks President Obama is behind leaks. Leaving out Donald.

836030554806042624 2017-02-26 01:49:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @markknoller Journalists should start using the name 'John Barron' as a pseudonym for their source.
835918432923181057 2017-02-26 18:24:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump This fake news whine is getting tiresome. Isn't here something else you can bitch about

833898085327712260 2017-02-20 04:36:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @Smiling_Trina I agree. This is like FB used to be before we got the emoticons.
833880647831842816 2017-02-20 03:26:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff Of course he's a danger to this entire country. But there is little we can do. We ridicule him to lessen the stress.

832789471993135104 2017-02-17 03:10:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta Sole purpose of doing this is to restrict access and forcibly remove citizens who do not support Trump. Protesters=trespassers.

832631515771068420 2017-02-17 16:43:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump In other words the Craigslist candidate list must be pretty slim right now.
832631149226815488 2017-02-17 16:41:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @FoxNews Donald must have read that poll backwards yesterday.

831351163115143168 2017-02-13 03:55:37 UTC <BethTedder1> PM Trudeau blocked Donald's aggressive handshake jerking. He must have practiced his defensive maneuvers.https://twitter.com/ABC/status/831171027845554176
831309503106777088 2017-02-13 01:10:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @tifftakesoff Well it turns out Kellyanne made a fool of herself so it worked out OK in the end.

830886229659045889 2017-02-12 21:08:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @crehage I can see you have a MUCH better grasp of the artful use of sarcasm than Donald does.
830885061511757825 2017-02-12 21:03:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Sarcasm is apparently beyond your level of comprehension.
830883681153712129 2017-02-12 20:58:01 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Um...no he didnt. And you weren't smart enough to run for president either. You lied your way.
830882550600056832 2017-02-12 20:53:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Not according to your ICE officials. Who is lying? You? Them? Come on...which is it?
830881518356746241 2017-02-12 20:49:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That was the worst script-reading I have ever seen. Except for yours.

830581456137240577 2017-02-11 00:57:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump It's a damn shame you dragged her into all your mess because you couldn't be President by yourself.
830580739330670592 2017-02-11 00:54:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump How much did it cost you to get Melania to show up? A blue box?
830579751047819264 2017-02-11 00:50:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump There is no winter White House. There is only one White House. And you are not there. You are vacationing.
830543860778545154 2017-02-11 22:27:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff Shake it off. You are recording history that may never see sunlight...at least not during the next few years.

830424504216252417 2017-02-11 14:33:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump More people in the US die from their own dog killing them than from refugees.

830222126544207872 2017-02-10 01:09:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's because that particular point was moot, given the rest of the lawlessness in the EO.

823695137142345729 2017-01-23 00:53:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald He mistakenly equated the CIA as part of the military. Lead balloon.
823694691573100545 2017-01-23 00:51:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald He was embarassing...ref Pompeo deciding to go into military after West Point. Everyone goes into military after West Point.
823693211361300481 2017-01-23 00:45:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald @stevemag19 Donald never allowed the room to be seated. Standing? Yes. Entire room. Entire speech.

818113021407072257 2017-01-08 15:11:58 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump She has already said you are a buffoon. LOL
817898899214073857 2017-01-07 01:01:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump BTW when are you going to make your "what I know that everyone else doesn't" announcement. We are still waiting.
817757841373138946 2017-01-07 15:40:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You have insulted our allies. You have insulted our intelligence community. You have insulted every single American.
817757686045573121 2017-01-07 15:40:00 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump This statement is not funny. I cannot joke about what you said. It is sickening and terrifying.
817757561839620100 2017-01-07 15:39:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You cannot be President with that opinion. You are a self-serving traitor to our country's best interests.
817757354389368832 2017-01-07 15:38:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You cannot be President with that opinion. You are a self-serving traitor to our country's best interests.

817730719069913088 2017-01-07 13:52:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You only won because of the hacking help. We know it and you know it. Lying doesn't make it not true.
817730184312946688 2017-01-07 13:50:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You lie with every breath.
817729960634892288 2017-01-07 13:49:49 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Not according to intelligence report. RNC WAS hacked also. Do you think we cannot read?
817490229800091648 2017-01-06 21:57:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Whoop-de-doo. Are you interviewing them for Cabinet? If not...get to work!
817489599136198656 2017-01-06 21:54:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That information must have been covered in one of the intelligence briefings you skipped. You watched Apprentice instead?
817443341784772614 2017-01-06 18:50:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And while you're at it, investigate how Giuliani knew about Comey letter. Criminal!
817442394924843016 2017-01-06 18:47:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Don't you have more important things to do? Grow up!
817441597587595266 2017-01-06 18:43:58 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Passion. Combined with no compassion. Combined with gullibility. Combined with self-centeredness. Equals Trump voters.
817440208794845185 2017-01-06 18:38:27 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The factual media is ignoring this because they consider your "wall" to be a lie and a joke. Will never happen.
817175525231837188 2017-01-05 01:06:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Whined about like a true clown...with a wig and orange facepaint.
817174599225974785 2017-01-05 01:03:01 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are now a politician, Donald. You'd better figure this stuff out fast.
817173395003637760 2017-01-05 00:58:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are the one who says you know a lot about hacking. So what is your knowledgeable assessment?
817172926155935745 2017-01-05 00:56:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Did it ever cross your mind that good jobs in Mexico keep Mexican workers there? Instead of here?
817172393634500609 2017-01-05 00:54:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And if you tweet a quote from Stalin does that mean you are simply stating for the hell of it? Or because you agree?
817171336833462274 2017-01-05 00:50:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump A big fan of intelligence?!? Is that like being a big fan of Kiss or the Patriots or something?!?
816807845308076032 2017-01-04 00:45:40 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You lower yourself to use a young girl as a political pawn in your game? Poor Jackie.
816653435189731328 2017-01-04 14:32:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Do you actually know ANYTHING about ANYTHING in this country? Do you even CARE?
816652862923096065 2017-01-04 14:29:49 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump If I told you the earth was flat, would you tweet that to the entire world?
816246297783074816 2017-01-03 11:34:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Go to your intelligence briefings instead of reading the Enquirer.
816238912125435904 2017-01-03 11:04:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And you profit from China? Cutting off your own nose again?
816050581127254016 2017-01-02 22:36:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You had no idea and neither did anyone else.
816050001143070720 2017-01-02 22:34:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump For God's sake MOVE ON! You are going to be President and no one cares about that anymore!
815300529148530689 2016-12-31 20:56:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Just what we need for a Commander-in-Chief...a drama Queen who calls his fellow Americans losers.
815085135536287744 2016-12-30 06:40:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @JimBrownNFL32 @AmerIcan32 @realDonaldTrump This is a joke party...right?
815082917953159172 2016-12-30 06:31:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @FoxNews @NBCNews @CNN @realDonaldTrump Russia is playing YOU for a fool and YOU don't have a clue.
814928165646823425 2016-12-30 20:16:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump What exactly has Putin promised you? It is apparent you have been bought.
814642404112338945 2016-12-29 01:20:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @KeithOlbermann Don't put yourself out or anything, Donald. Just whenever you have a spare minute.
814173042867916801 2016-12-28 18:15:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Won't be a thing you can do about it. Already voted on. Do you intend to take on the UN? You will lose...loser.
814172182154739712 2016-12-28 18:12:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Sure we can. Just like they treated those innocent little boys on the beach when they blew their arms and legs off.
814171468225449985 2016-12-28 18:09:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Speaking of inflammatory...look up self-immolation. Practice makes perfect.
814170842074640388 2016-12-28 18:07:09 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are so foolish and childish, how can any adult even respond to you without sounding like a third-grader?
813606475830620160 2016-12-26 04:44:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Do you have to whine about EVERYTHING?
813604604327985152 2016-12-26 04:37:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Mommy! They won't let me in their club! Waaaah!!!
813603912079069184 2016-12-26 04:34:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And they aren't going to let you in their club. They don't like you.
813601636958486528 2016-12-26 04:25:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump DJT Foundation was your own private slush fund. And you got caught using it. You are guilty. Get used to it.
812817235555270656 2016-12-24 00:28:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews So?!?
812816928205131778 2016-12-24 00:27:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Jesus was born tonight and you are hawking a TV show?!? Shame!!
812814502009958400 2016-12-24 00:17:33 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No you won't. There will be no peace until Netanyahu is gone.
812812436923383809 2016-12-24 00:09:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump that's because the first part of your statement is so ignorant no one is paying attention to the second part.
812445492118482944 2016-12-23 23:51:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Dylann Roof laughed & said 'somebody had to do it' referring to his slaughter of 9 Americans. This was purely racist.
812441787600080896 2016-12-23 23:36:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump hopefully they will hold a vote to condemn you.
812441188565450753 2016-12-23 23:34:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump sure he can..he just can't sell access to the Presidency for charity. NO PAY FOR PLAY. Remember?
812439873051357184 2016-12-23 23:28:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump For God's sake MOVE ON, you baby!
812087087608565760 2016-12-22 00:07:04 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump It only takes one to incinerate millions of people. Russia will drop the first on you. Don't worry...you'll never know it.
811592750315569152 2016-12-21 15:22:44 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's because NO ONE cares.
811380305575682049 2016-12-20 01:18:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Then why did you talk crap about him?
811057713098747904 2016-12-19 03:56:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Then start talking like you won a Presidency instead of a grade-school student council contest.
810619504149532673 2016-12-18 22:55:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You knew all along about Russia's hacking. You colluded with them. You will go down for treason.
810614555705479168 2016-12-18 22:35:45 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are so terribly unprecedential.
810614016859054080 2016-12-18 22:33:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Are you that stupid? Who do you think we are emulating? It's about time we fought fire with fire!
810318491123335169 2016-12-17 02:59:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You would cry 'UNCLE' and give away our technology to the 'enemy'?!? Cut off your own nose?!?
809577189545013248 2016-12-15 01:53:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @VanityFair @realDonaldTrump Grow up, you short-fingered vulgarian.
809573049095884800 2016-12-15 01:37:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @kurteichenwald His memory is short...much like his penis.
809572514657607681 2016-12-15 01:35:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Actually it is complex...unlike you.
808728525872254978 2016-12-13 17:41:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You'd better have Pick #2 ready because he'll never be confirmed.
808728014821478400 2016-12-13 17:39:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Are you lying about that like you have lied about all the rest of your promises?
808483134517944320 2016-12-12 01:26:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Apparently your memory is as short as your weiner.
808482426859245568 2016-12-12 01:23:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You're such a child. You really think that you can change that, don't you?
807781206939041792 2016-12-10 02:57:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We want you to fly in YOUR plane instead. With no upgrades.Please oh please.
807780175169679364 2016-12-10 02:52:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @CNN Not according to Kellyanne. Are you lying or is she?
807779564663480320 2016-12-10 02:50:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Not according to Kellyanne. Are you lying or is she?
806694992722923520 2016-12-07 03:00:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @NYCMayor Cut off police security. Let SS handle it themselves or Trump private security.
804916700596633600 2016-12-02 05:14:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Our President-elect needs an updated copy of "Foreign Policy For Dummies"
804916257497776129 2016-12-02 05:12:45 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump One business down...29,999,999 to go. This is gonna cost a lot.
798747042520694784 2016-11-15 04:38:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Give us a break. You don't even know what the positions are or what they do.
798233740463968256 2016-11-14 18:38:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Get over it. Debates are old news now.
798232889049710592 2016-11-14 18:35:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @ananavarro And Giuliani leaked FBI info in national TV. Egad!!!
795724443851100169 2016-11-07 20:27:45 UTC <BethTedder1> @ananavarro Thank you Ana...thank you. You made a wonderful choice for all our futures. You will not regret it.
795424623034769414 2016-11-06 00:36:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Mommy took away your toy, you bad little boy. Now sending you away to military school?!?
794267812449513472 2016-11-03 19:59:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @ananavarro No disgrace to vote for HRC. Respected Republicans are. I respect your indecision but please rebuke Trump this one last time.
794238681573769216 2016-11-03 18:03:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Melania Trump getting ready to give a speech in PA. Don't bother listening...we've heard it all before.

789107214271197184 2016-10-20 14:13:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You made all of Hillary's too.
789106176738729984 2016-10-20 14:09:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You need serious psychiatric help.
784922224318943232 2016-10-08 01:03:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @TilmanGoins What is your response to Trump's video? Do you intend to continue your support of him.
782441276339736577 2016-10-01 04:45:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No great loss cause they have to have papers read to them.

970403189018243073 2018-03-04 20:58:44 UTC <BethTedder1> Your head is bald. #TriggerTrumpIn4Words
970401883981516801 2018-03-04 20:53:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's because we manufacture vehicles that are substandard to theirs.
968518021345173504 2018-02-27 16:07:45 UTC <BethTedder1> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Just wait.
967572299670056960 2018-02-24 01:29:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Dupree also said of other parents interviewed on CNN,  With two real children involved, it this were real, they would be real and would be with their children, consoling them, not promoting the New World Order agenda of total control, including the control of childrens minds.
967572042248802304 2018-02-24 01:28:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You retweet a scumbag who said On and before December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook was infested with espionage operatives. These operatives posed as the incredible, primarily parents."
967489839313670144 2018-02-24 20:02:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are truly a brain-damaged individual.

966485015956807681 2018-02-21 01:29:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub Shulkin must resign.
966484589832212481 2018-02-21 01:27:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald Person to person sales should be ok but there should be a notarized bill of sale with the serial number. Actually, conscientious gun owners mostly do this. But stricter adherence or penalties for not getting one.
966482646653198336 2018-02-21 01:19:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald I think banning rifle magazines over 5 shots would take care of the majority of mass shootings. Federal buyback. Huge fed fine for possession. Crimestoppers rewards.

964684100127854592 2018-02-16 02:13:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe six months or so. Until he's indicted or resigns. Or both.

941070952024231937 2017-12-13 22:22:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No. His dick was stacked against him.
941070739855282177 2017-12-13 22:22:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump What part of 'almost 70% of Americans despise you' do you not understand?
941070325399343106 2017-12-13 22:20:24 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Instead of all the crappy candidates of the last ten years?

940752014484627457 2017-12-12 01:15:33 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And you're a vulgar pig.
940064528632385536 2017-12-10 03:43:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr The irony of the USA having a president named Trump is laughable to begin with but especially so since his offspring is even more laughable.
940061467591585792 2017-12-10 03:31:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @arvillove A shit stain.
939664265199472641 2017-12-09 01:13:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @RepSwalwell That's a mistranscription. He actually said "...primarily because of comics. I'm reading comics a lot."
939663485763489793 2017-12-09 01:10:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr There are no stories in favor of Trump.
939661408110829568 2017-12-09 01:01:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Yeah. Because Pelosi and Schumer won't allow pedophiles to sit.
939660939992928256 2017-12-09 01:00:00 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We can't wait until all your secrets are exposed following CNN's headline 'Breaking News'.

937033253642539010 2017-12-02 18:58:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The only way that will happen is if we impeach you and Pence. You are both liars.

936620865504075778 2017-12-01 15:39:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump However they WERE told by the police lab that the man only had one grain of gunshot residue on his hands along with 18,000 grains of cracker crumbs from the food in his pockets.
936619172678848512 2017-12-01 15:33:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And the ones who have not been allowed to read the bill. Includes almost all senators.

934835850462015488 2017-11-26 17:26:49 UTC <BethTedder1> @NormEisen 'Dodo-in-chief' is more reflective of Trump's emotional maturity. He'll understand it better.

926461850627256320 2017-11-03 14:51:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Clinton is a Democrat. Sanders is not. DNC supported a Democrat. 1+1=2.
926432757949059072 2017-11-03 12:55:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Because they're too busy indicting every single person in your administration that actually committed a crime.

921508680608206848 2017-10-20 22:49:24 UTC <BethTedder1> John Kelly owes an apology to Rep. Wilson. He needs to meet with her and restore his honor because he impugned it yesterday.
921485603967062016 2017-10-20 21:17:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @politico This is sad. He has to be told how to vote by aides. His family should take charge.
921484978793472000 2017-10-20 21:15:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @MhlongoMax @speechboy71 One thing that struck me was Kelly said Trump asked him "What do I say?" Concerning that he should ask this if he's made these calls before?

921236438317875200 2017-10-19 04:47:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrhmp You call an intimate family friend of the deceased soldier 'wacky'? Yes, you are a fucking moron.
921236014202462208 2017-10-19 04:45:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Kelley stated today that you asked him 'What do I say?' before calling the widow. Are you that inept? Apparently so, since he also said he instructed you on what to say to her.
921235361409376256 2017-10-19 04:43:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump If it was so secret, why were both you and the widow on speakerphone?

920854810819252225 2017-10-18 03:31:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @RepSwalwell I even posted on Facebook that I have a crush on you! (on your mind, of course)
920852779920478213 2017-10-18 03:23:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @Heritage @realDonaldTrump Racist haters.
920852636550787077 2017-10-18 03:22:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump More like hours, not days.
920852300612227073 2017-10-18 03:21:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Liar.
920852178071445505 2017-10-18 03:20:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Big liar.
920852129971097601 2017-10-18 03:20:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Liar.
920852058021953536 2017-10-18 03:20:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Liar.
920850969696636928 2017-10-18 03:15:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Regular people don't care about the stock market. We buy and sell on EBay, not Wall Street.
920849659177947141 2017-10-18 03:10:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump It is. 66% of Americans think you're inventing alternate truths aka LIES.
920443631596687360 2017-10-17 00:17:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump It worked quite well for my husband and myself.
920150515056545793 2017-10-16 04:52:33 UTC <BethTedder1> @jaketapper @ddale8 In other words, he hasn't a fucking clue.

920129599916429312 2017-10-16 03:29:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta First thing to do is stop saying 'misstating facts'. It's called lying. Willfully and wholeheartedly.
919728255321755648 2017-10-15 00:54:38 UTC <BethTedder1> @EdWGillespie @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence How about that crowd!? What...400 max?

919566949948055552 2017-10-15 14:13:40 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Cancellations are not progress. They are regressive. They require no thought or process. They hurt our country and citizens. You are a complete failure as a president and a human being.
919224012470964224 2017-10-14 15:30:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @impeach_d_trump @boring_as_heck Ditto.
918971600019644416 2017-10-13 22:47:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Not all of us do. And no matter what you say or do, you can't make us.

918969753452072960 2017-10-13 22:40:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They don't want you. They want food, water, medical care and power. You can go to hell as far as they are concerned.
918969155977711617 2017-10-13 22:38:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Liar.

918632520362745857 2017-10-12 00:20:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are the most hated President the world has ever seen.

918172267439362050 2017-10-11 17:51:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump At no point. Ever.
918172002971738113 2017-10-11 17:50:38 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The public does not care about the stock market.

917955882796900353 2017-10-10 03:31:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @Acosta Of course not. Trump does not know how to joke. All he knows are sarcastic insults.
917949725005045761 2017-10-10 03:07:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @BikiniRobotArmy @tasker2003 I wish I could delete him. Permanently.
917948988032258049 2017-10-10 03:04:28 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Why would you fire him? He is more likely to resign in disgust.
917901979892043776 2017-10-10 23:57:40 UTC <BethTedder1> @business @Cleo50506842 I'll show them! *stamps foot*

917829795567800320 2017-10-10 19:10:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @IsraelUSAforevr Retweeting another bot. How about that free MENSA test?
917829366947696641 2017-10-10 19:09:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Mensa has offered for you to compete free on an IQ test with Tillerson. I'm sure Corker would agree also. Put up or shut up.

917776003681914881 2017-10-10 15:37:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Moron.
917775688018616320 2017-10-10 15:35:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @JoeNBC If he really had honor he would have expressed his feelings in public a long time ago.
917775167744610305 2017-10-10 15:33:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Promoting a for-profit product is a violation of 5 CFR 2635.702 - Use of public office for private gain.
917773523745148928 2017-10-10 15:27:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The Moron speaks gibberish.
917773054993928193 2017-10-10 15:25:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @tribelaw Of course not. Well Cotton did. But he doesn't count.

917375665229434880 2017-10-09 13:06:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @AriFleischer No they haven't. He has a right to leave. They are appalled that the whole thing was a set-up. Trump verified it.
917374713428697090 2017-10-09 13:02:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They only started acting like real asses after you came along.
917373758201040898 2017-10-09 12:58:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @VP @realDonaldTrump From the Liar-in-Chief.
917245511832350721 2017-10-08 04:29:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @Larrylamb11E @mikefreemanNFL Good way to run them off from somewhere we don't want them then. Just take a knee so they'll leave!
917196260574220288 2017-10-08 01:13:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @nypost @realDonaldTrump I understand you really need it for your legal defense.
917110575750139905 2017-10-08 19:32:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @KazmierskiR @DonaldJTrumpJr @hirsh123 It means confidential. Not classified.
917109741914075144 2017-10-08 19:29:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Gen. Kelly's phone was compromised. So where is it now? Is it still active? Accessible? Or perhaps it would be best to destroy it.
917107571739320320 2017-10-08 19:20:58 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @Jhorecky @molly_knight But you're ok with disrespecting the disabled, veterans, mayors, women, senators, poor, congresspeople, LGBTQ's, Latinos? ALL AMERICANS!
917103398444589056 2017-10-08 19:04:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr I support his right to leave just as I support their right to kneel.
917102767801536512 2017-10-08 19:01:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @SecondLady @VP @realDonaldTrump Taking credit, huh?
917094843939254272 2017-10-08 18:30:24 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @VP I fight for your right to walk out the same as I fight for their right to kneel.
917057731097452544 2017-10-08 16:02:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit.
917057462120919040 2017-10-08 16:01:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Your endorsement is the kiss of death now. Who would want it?
917056351485952001 2017-10-08 15:57:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueCPI Not if they're running for re-election.
916820378521161728 2017-10-07 00:19:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub I can't. Reached my limit. :(
916819003913490432 2017-10-07 00:14:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Do you not realize that 95% of your positive Twitter supporters are bots?
916759359354437632 2017-10-07 20:17:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Why the FUCK do you keep saying shit like that?!? Do you enjoy scaring the crap out of us? Do you enjoy making us sick daily?!?
916655004483817472 2017-10-07 13:22:38 UTC <BethTedder1> @RonaldLorenzen1 @realDonaldTrump @drhelldigger Only about 25%. The other 75% want it and want it better.
916654661188407296 2017-10-07 13:21:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump When are you going to tweet about the job loss?
916654407219019777 2017-10-07 13:20:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump Campaign. Campaign. Campaign. The campaign was over a year ago. Move the fuck on.
916654086195417088 2017-10-07 13:18:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Republicans are decidedly unfunny. That's why there are so few.
916653559999025153 2017-10-07 13:16:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Paris Dennard likes you. LOL.
916653190912921601 2017-10-07 13:15:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Funny. I watch @CNN and I see identified Republicans on there all day. Most of them abhor you.
916139714364702720 2017-10-05 03:15:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub Perhaps staff should take a hammer to it to prevent further security breach.  *snicker*
916128978808856576 2017-10-05 02:32:24 UTC <BethTedder1> @ComfortablySmug Dying laughing!!!
916128689615548416 2017-10-05 02:31:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @robertc3d He's a sick motherfucker.
916128229680967680 2017-10-05 02:29:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @Lovebugaboo I don't know how much longer I can take this turmoil. I certainly can't take it for three more years. :(
916127512836616192 2017-10-05 02:26:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump He should sue you for saying that.
916127129292693504 2017-10-05 02:25:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @Lovebugaboo My stomach hurts. Again.
916108213854134272 2017-10-05 01:09:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @kylegriffin1 This man really scares me.

916074219951345664 2017-10-05 22:54:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Damn it, just STOP IT! Stop embarrassing yourself and your administration and your cabinet and your country. Get some mental help!
916074052669837312 2017-10-05 22:54:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump Damn it, just STOP IT! Stop embarrassing yourself and your administration and your cabinet and your country. Get some mental help!
916072200683352064 2017-10-05 22:46:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump And your word is believable? Pardon me while I laugh my ass off.
915822015608745984 2017-10-04 06:12:38 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You're getting BORING. Same tweets over and over. Can't you come up with something different? How about calling Theresa May a fat cow?
915821294884671489 2017-10-04 06:09:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Yep. Fake News reported a hurricane hitting Puerto Rico. What BS! How dare they? Faked video too!
915820326470258688 2017-10-04 06:05:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Did you tell them to have a good time?
915819566638432256 2017-10-04 06:02:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @SpeakerRyan @politico He'll be resigning. Probably tomorrow or Friday.
915819183543390208 2017-10-04 06:01:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @CNN @Hope012015 He has one reason. Obama did it. That's the only reason important to him.
915750621248200704 2017-10-04 01:28:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @Larrylamb11E @RedTRaccoon Anyone who pulls out a gun in public without intending to use it is an ignorant, gun-illiterate fool. All he had to do was pat his pocket.
915749115841187840 2017-10-04 01:22:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @Fahrenthold @kylegriffin1 He should just go ahead and resign. Probably will within a few days.
915748546867064834 2017-10-04 01:20:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @kylegriffin1 Glad to see his heart is heavy with thoughts of what he plans to say.
915748199696084992 2017-10-04 01:19:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub Excellent story of investigative journalism. Good work.
915737842239852545 2017-10-04 00:38:09 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @kurteichenwald Interesting that Trump has over 35 million followers yet struggles to reach 100,000 likes on his tweets. Most often, much less than that.
915407240265392128 2017-10-03 02:44:28 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @RogueCPI Hard.
915371848346546176 2017-10-03 00:23:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And he could have killed plenty more but he offed himself.
915371678468857858 2017-10-03 00:23:09 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The broken window glass probably gave them a hint.
915327981899456512 2017-10-03 21:29:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @davidaxelrod Here. Catch this roll of paper towels.
915327779117436929 2017-10-03 21:28:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We are not proud of you. You are the biggest embarrassment this country has ever seen.
915066609299070976 2017-10-02 04:10:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueFirstLady Unless he gets to dedicate another golf tournament trophy.
914632971231080454 2017-10-01 23:27:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump If you start a nuclear war, your life won't be worth a nickle. To anyone. To any country. Not even to your family. Let that sink in.
914631956331159552 2017-10-01 23:23:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @davidaxelrod He gets bored with his sh*t-stirring on one subject and excites himself by starting another.
914307121856094208 2017-09-30 01:52:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @amazon @ShaunKing @nixter36 Absolutely. That was our donations to Harvey relief Tampons and adult diapers.
914285341699399681 2017-09-30 00:26:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Someone please, for the country's sake, rip his phone out of his hand and shove it up his ass all the way to their elbow.
914281946519343104 2017-09-30 00:12:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueCPI I don't know how well he is. But he is a fucking bastard asshole.
914270474993008640 2017-09-30 23:27:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The People of Puerto Rico can't hear you. They have no power, internet, phone service or running water.
913945900741021701 2017-09-29 01:57:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @CREWcrew He paid the wrong total!
913945534024515585 2017-09-29 01:56:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @linmp1031 @Synergy3k Oh FF's sake!!!
913941553483272194 2017-09-29 01:40:21 UTC <BethTedder1> @davidaxelrod Must we sue to get our reimbursement? Probably.
913940792963723264 2017-09-29 01:37:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump Sorry, busy watching CNN reporters saving Hurricane Maria victims in Puerto Rico.
913940612008824832 2017-09-29 01:36:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @seanhannity @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Sorry, busy watching CNN reporters saving Hurricane Maria victims in Puerto Rico.

913582896379809792 2017-09-28 01:55:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman Are they going to pay for Price's private jet trips?
913562691754749952 2017-09-28 00:34:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Fire Price. But make him fully reimburse first.
913552371929767936 2017-09-28 23:53:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are a failure! You won't win this one either.

913425206596849664 2017-09-28 15:28:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump What is in us that turns a deaf ear To the cries of human suffering?  Serg Tankian and Daron Malakian
913222240447160322 2017-09-27 02:02:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump  .
913040948095045632 2017-09-27 14:01:40 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You lost the People's vote. Lost. Lost. Lost.
913039426040864775 2017-09-27 13:55:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump How's this for desecrating the flag?pic.twitter.com/NSIRwS2LFz
913030912262180864 2017-09-27 13:21:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump A pathetic attempt at trying to show us you are not a racist loser.
913030627234074626 2017-09-27 13:20:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Did he tell you to mind your own business?
913030501820182528 2017-09-27 13:20:09 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Lose-rrrrrr! SAD!

912674309683937280 2017-09-26 13:44:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Actually he's trailing, but oh, those pesky facts...
912673849048739843 2017-09-26 13:42:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump I think we should have a regulation that fines the President $1,000,000 every time he says a word that media must bleep.
912496806705139713 2017-09-25 01:59:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @jayMAGA45 Tillman would have taken a knee against you. He would have despised you. Shows exactly how much you know.
912496199718113281 2017-09-25 01:57:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit. He's so pissed at you he can't see straight.
912495851959971840 2017-09-25 01:55:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Uh. No.
912131116542414849 2017-09-24 01:46:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You lose. Again. No, we're not tired of winning yet. Anytime you lose, we win. We love winning!
912130323583991808 2017-09-24 01:43:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And you should shut up about it and do your job. Which does not involve the NFL. They don't want your opinions or your threats.
912039038726615040 2017-09-24 19:40:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The solidarity is against you...you fucking asshole.
912038796774006784 2017-09-24 19:39:28 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Says the Boaster-in-Chief.
912036283664551937 2017-09-24 19:29:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump How does it feel for around 65% of the citizens  of this country to alternately laugh at you and hate you?
911665570977902593 2017-09-23 18:56:24 UTC <BethTedder1> @PreetBharara @waltshaub I am excited for both of you! Can't wait. I'll love CNN even more now. Of course I loved it when they fired that annoying Jeffrey Lord.
910513362357882880 2017-09-20 14:37:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @davidaxelrod Actually, it made sense either way so you get a pass.
910362751087906816 2017-09-19 04:39:28 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They were too polite to boo you.
910362343997046785 2017-09-19 04:37:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And you never won one.
910269574188322816 2017-09-19 22:29:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @USUN @UN_Spokesperson @UN @realDonaldTrump It's just a club where people talk and hang out. Your speech means nothing. Really.
910250126131810304 2017-09-19 21:11:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @maggieNYT I thought of that too! Someone told him. Someone who had an inside track. Someone like Guiliani?
910225153237426176 2017-09-19 19:32:42 UTC <BethTedder1> He is threatening to destroy an entire country of 35 million people because of one man. Fuck him.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/910192375267561472
910200975255842816 2017-09-19 17:56:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @GlennThrush And his loyal followers may have helped him change his mind. Because we're loyal like that
909981641610858496 2017-09-18 03:25:04 UTC <BethTedder1> @GlennThrush We'll see you when you get back, Glenn.
909930340784967681 2017-09-18 00:01:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @netanyahu @realDonaldTrump Enjoy it before Bibi goes to prison.
909851037875523587 2017-09-18 18:46:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @GlennThrush Nooooooo.
909850060254478337 2017-09-18 18:42:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @Fahrenthold @achillesintl must be more about currying favor with Trump than about standing behind the disabled. Maybe they should lose donations.

908906989790605312 2017-09-15 04:14:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @Fahrenthold @AP @NattyJPuffinton @Jhorecky @dabeard @l_burcher @Teri70487630 I have no link. David Fahrenthold reports each confirmation on Twitter. He checks with each charity  to see when they report receipt.
908875624705601536 2017-09-15 02:10:09 UTC <BethTedder1> @AP @NattyJPuffinton @Jhorecky @dabeard @l_burcher Beyond this info, which came from @Fahrenthold, I have no clue.

908862994066608129 2017-09-15 01:19:58 UTC <BethTedder1> @AdavNoti @waltshaub I can't like. Instead I'll Grrrrrrr!
908851666388230144 2017-09-15 00:34:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @slopholepounder @thecuttman @CaucasionKing Not really. Mostly related to intelligence.
908849758156070912 2017-09-15 00:27:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @slopholepounder @thecuttman @CaucasionKing I would never pick on someone purely because of their coloring. Spelling...yes. Color...no.
908846770528104448 2017-09-15 00:15:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @slopholepounder @CaucasionKing @thecuttman Maybe he was actually misspelling confusion.
908845636367392769 2017-09-15 00:10:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @CharlesMBlow My boobs are letting me down. They've fallen and they can't get up.
908845313905053696 2017-09-15 00:09:43 UTC <BethTedder1> Speaking from personal experience, I have zero confidence in boobs. They always eventually fall down and can't get up.https://twitter.com/AliveInPhilly/status/908776278131712001
908842778733445120 2017-09-15 23:59:38 UTC <BethTedder1> @Fahrenthold @AP @NattyJPuffinton @Jhorecky @dabeard He's paid $50,000 now. $25,000 each to Direct Relief and Habitat for Humanity. Only $950,000 to go!
908811134907625476 2017-09-15 21:53:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @seanbarakett Sort of.
908810967559102464 2017-09-15 21:53:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @thecuttman @slopholepounder No silly. I equated an expressed desire to cook Jews with an expressed desire to fuck children. But both can change. Right?
908810496941461504 2017-09-15 21:51:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @seanbarakett Let's gas all UCF grads. Because I think they're worthless sub-human garbage. LOL!!  Oh wait. That was a joke. Sort of.
908809600442519553 2017-09-15 21:47:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @ShaunKing @thecuttman @slopholepounder Do child molesters get a free pass after 4 years? Because they 'change'?
908808638021668864 2017-09-15 21:43:58 UTC <BethTedder1> @stevenmnuchin1 @JakeSherman There's that disgusting hubris again.
908808315802722305 2017-09-15 21:42:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump NOW you say something presidential-calibre after tweeting your normal crap earlier today. But too late. Your initial reaction was more true.
908769577806548993 2017-09-15 19:08:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Like John McCain?
908744960647860224 2017-09-15 17:30:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @NatlParkService @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @Mrtimrock @BarefootRockU Says me. Every single day. And my family. And my friends.
908744165097435136 2017-09-15 17:27:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @SenWarren If they have a CDL, then there is no issue. If not, then they should be capable of passing the test. Again, no issue.
908737605382103040 2017-09-15 17:01:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @SenWarren Speaking as a liberal truck-driver' s wife.
908736760468922369 2017-09-15 16:58:21 UTC <BethTedder1> @SenWarren Not necessarily. Driving a truck on a six-lane interstate is a little different than driving on a dirt road.
908727995791286272 2017-09-15 16:23:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @CREWcrew Damn!!!!!
908727635584454656 2017-09-15 16:22:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @CREWcrew Ok.....
908708686520078337 2017-09-15 15:06:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @CREWcrew @NoahBookbinder Waiting with bated breath!
908694206058778625 2017-09-15 14:09:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump It would also not be legal. But of course, you don't know that. Or care. Or can be taught.
908693838117654533 2017-09-15 14:07:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Who spit in your Cheerios this morning?
908693515223420929 2017-09-15 14:06:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit.
908693415298322433 2017-09-15 14:06:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit.
908692543654768640 2017-09-15 14:02:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Cut off internet?
908692292877389824 2017-09-15 14:01:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's to keep them from passing stupid legislation.
908413770615197696 2017-09-14 19:34:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump ???????
908413382721753090 2017-09-14 19:33:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are the curse.
908413264983453696 2017-09-14 19:32:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit.
908413085131657218 2017-09-14 19:32:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No, it won't. You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.
908339812071088129 2017-09-14 14:41:01 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @deepknight @DrCheddar04 So far $25,000 is all. To Direct Relief. Only $975,000 to go.
908339291385987072 2017-09-14 14:38:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And a few rounds of golf?
908339139548008449 2017-09-14 14:38:21 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Just you. And your entire administration. And the Republican House and Senate. And your 33% base. No one else.
908338990998269952 2017-09-14 14:37:46 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Just you. And your entire administration. And the Republican House and Senate. And your 33% base. No one else.
908186805761167360 2017-09-13 04:33:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @waltshaub He could have used one of Hillary's old cellphones. Or her email server. Turns out they are pretty secure.
908185428351766528 2017-09-13 04:27:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @JulieS604 You forgot intelligence.
908177852243292160 2017-09-13 03:57:27 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @jackiebwatson Or in the Caymans.
908177537670549504 2017-09-13 03:56:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump So you think we should copy China's tax laws. Really? Anything else idiotic to say? Like 'America First'? Or 'America Should Be Like China'?
908175417135255554 2017-09-13 03:47:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald Big smile at that!
908175050519564289 2017-09-13 03:46:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You know, you might be a better President if you would focus on your job and stop whining about what Clinton is doing. Give. It. Up.

908019365592870924 2017-09-13 17:27:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No. We need to raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for Irma and Harvey.
908018943293607936 2017-09-13 17:26:00 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Don't they have to write a bill first?
907615012683907077 2017-09-12 14:40:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @washingtonpost This guy is a fruitcake. Why would any government entity even give him the time of day?
907595628066349057 2017-09-12 13:23:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Of course, because you are such a secretive and media-reticent person. They can only imagine what you are like.

907436225157529600 2017-09-11 02:50:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueCPI Sad you had to see it in person. Changed your whole life, I'm sure.
907345423748255744 2017-09-11 20:49:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @linmp1031 So many. The older we get the more we lose. Tears. But there is always a new baby needing a home.
907343576350298112 2017-09-11 20:42:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @linmp1031 I lost my first tux, Gypsy, after 18 years. Adopted Murphy 3 yrs ago. He's a nut! I've had five or six others, but those are the only tuxes.

906518737813213184 2017-09-09 14:04:44 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No, they should'nt. They made a choice to be tax-exempt and exist on donations therefore they made a choice not to accept public tax money
906167505760256001 2017-09-08 14:49:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @CREWcrew Good. Thanks for letting us know!

905431946896998402 2017-09-06 14:06:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump But Sessions said it was illegal  does that mean you will continue it even if it is illegal? You are personification of Jekyll/Hyde.
905431409396994049 2017-09-06 14:04:04 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No, we are not. No matter how many times you repeat it, it is still a lie.

901826913844555776 2017-08-27 15:21:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump A lot. Exactly how much is that?
901826689919004673 2017-08-27 15:20:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That would be several years from now.
901826425132638210 2017-08-27 15:19:09 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Many people or some people? And are those different people or the same people?

901116294291914752 2017-08-25 16:17:21 UTC <BethTedder1> @StephenKing It's too difficult for him to understand. He sticks to cartoons for entertainment.

900719770265432064 2017-08-24 14:01:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump He is an authority on proper presidential conduct.
900718982881312768 2017-08-24 13:58:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Republicans just can't seem to understand that Americans by far now LIKE Obamacare. They are still living in the past.

900703451713331200 2017-08-24 12:56:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's because there is no chance you have any clue how it works. Government.
900702993024245761 2017-08-24 12:55:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Only because 'their' schizophrenic speeches from a schizophrenic man.

900214165574430721 2017-08-22 04:32:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @davidaxelrod He was so annoying!
900213859545473025 2017-08-22 04:31:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueCPI I have no more words to describe him. I think the worst of the worst have been spoken tonight.

899866560269090816 2017-08-21 05:31:21 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta @ItsYorgi Then why bother with the tweets and speech? Just do it.
899866329422974976 2017-08-21 05:30:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta @craigblanton As soon as one of Trumps generals gets to a phone to call them.
899866021460414464 2017-08-21 05:29:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta @jimmyniner1868 Then why the speech, twitter announcement, etc? Why not just do it?

889832241131552769 2017-07-25 12:58:33 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Giving a political rally speech to the Big Brothers and Big Sisters meeting?
889831957705764865 2017-07-25 12:57:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Lie.
889831818563907584 2017-07-25 12:56:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Use your own son for a sick political joke. Go ahead. That sets a precedent. Now we can use him for our sick political jokes too.
889831208984731649 2017-07-25 12:54:27 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump He's not a hero. He was captured.
889831094639579136 2017-07-25 12:53:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Betcha he votes no.
889830978230812672 2017-07-25 12:53:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump As if you really care what is in the bill. All you want is something to sign. Nothing more. Nothing less.
889830812048404480 2017-07-25 12:52:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump As if you really care what is in the bill. All you want is something to sign. Nothing more. Nothing less.
889830487061123072 2017-07-25 12:51:35 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump So youre going to hire someone who donated to you instead? Whats the difference?
889702757921427456 2017-07-24 04:24:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @GlennKesslerWP @adamentous He heard about the story from some people. Didn't read it himself. Has no idea. As usual.
889683455847657478 2017-07-24 03:07:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump What I heard today was an abomination speaking to the Scouts. Children being used as political pawns in a sick game by a sick man.

889681534793469952 2017-07-24 02:59:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @boyscouts @InkyJohnson What I heard today was an abomination speaking to the Scouts. Children being used as political pawns in a sick game by a sick man.
889633175777009666 2017-07-24 23:47:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @carol_NC66 @RepAdamSchiff He is a vindictive, irresponsible, incompetent and juvenile little man. He is not worthy to stand in the same room as you.
889562291603165184 2017-07-24 19:05:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They are bigger failures than you. You can't even be a winner at failing.
889561781936541696 2017-07-24 19:03:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Maybe because she didn't break the law?
889295287629615105 2017-07-23 01:24:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump For someone who has 34 million followers why do you get so few likes?
889294046841241602 2017-07-23 01:19:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Sounds like an empty threat.
889293600395231233 2017-07-23 01:18:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Such a precedential tweet. From the Twit-er-in-Chief.
889293248027602944 2017-07-23 01:16:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump So how is it that Democrats are the obstructionists then?
889292511289716736 2017-07-23 01:13:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump How much did that cost you?
889221184235196418 2017-07-23 20:30:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @jaketapper On their knees, of course.
889220755061452801 2017-07-23 20:28:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Whines the Twit-er-in-Chief...
889220023788740609 2017-07-23 20:25:49 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We're waiting on your next tweet...
889219693961236480 2017-07-23 20:24:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Poor Donald. Disloyalty sucks, doesn't it?
889217778732986370 2017-07-23 20:16:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump WTF? Are you drunk-tweeting?
889217118876696576 2017-07-23 20:14:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Take your meds.
889188124533948417 2017-07-23 18:19:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @Scaramucci You've gotten into a bed full of fleas. You're already scratching.
888972433130225664 2017-07-22 04:01:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And how's that working?
888971787924631552 2017-07-22 03:59:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No. Many people couldn't care less because she did not break any laws. Unlike you and your entire administration.
888589225930756096 2017-07-21 02:39:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The President's tweet speaks for itself. Code for he's an idiot and I have no way to defend him.
888279040188010496 2017-07-20 06:06:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @smilexgratitude And we LOVE how Mrs. Abe pretended not to speak English so she would not have to talk to idiot Trump at the G20 dinner. Priceless!!!
888278638990311424 2017-07-20 06:05:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @smilexgratitude And we normal Americans feel the same about you!
888176139533004801 2017-07-20 23:17:47 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueFirstLady A hero. And a zero.
888175188680089600 2017-07-20 23:14:01 UTC <BethTedder1> @nyulaw @PreetBharara Enjoy your tweets, sir. Good sense of humor!
888174192939716609 2017-07-20 23:10:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We do. We just don't believe in you.
887759219361021952 2017-07-19 19:41:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Hold your breath, please.
887759017988304896 2017-07-19 19:40:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Their plans suck. So what is YOUR plan. Have never heard you discuss it.
887421771166699521 2017-07-18 21:20:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No, you said we would have a big, beautiful new plan that would insure everyone with great coverage. Where is that plan?
887421331326869504 2017-07-18 21:18:27 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump So you have given up on this year? Aw poor baby. Being President with no winning is disheartening, isn't it?
887420257467600898 2017-07-18 21:14:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Doesn't mean sh*t to me. I just need to pay my past due Dr. Bills.
887292834872741888 2017-07-18 12:47:51 UTC <BethTedder1> Can we go ahead and repeal Donald and figure out his replacement in the next two years?
887290672587436032 2017-07-18 12:39:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @ananavarro Don't worry about it. Few do.
887290005227544576 2017-07-18 12:36:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @kurteichenwald Trump doesn't know which Ivanka shoe goes on which foot.
887289635134722048 2017-07-18 12:35:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Your desperation is showing.
887289070602387456 2017-07-18 12:32:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Of course. Screw the American people. As long as you WIN, nothing else matters.
887284961115504641 2017-07-18 12:16:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump President Obama worked his butt off getting the ACA. You gave done nothing but spout and play golf.No wonder the new plan is a grand failure
887143194709905408 2017-07-17 02:53:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @Larrylamb11E @jimsciutto Really.

887139438568058880 2017-07-17 02:38:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @politico What kind of poor souls in this country actually think he is doing a good job?
887137002256310276 2017-07-17 02:28:38 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump In case you didn't know, you are a Republican too. What have you done about it? Nothing but threaten and insult. How's that working for you?
887136153689882624 2017-07-17 02:25:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They couldn't find their asses with both hands. Dems want no part of their current clusterf**k. Or the WH clusterf**k extraordinaire.
887099980510633985 2017-07-17 00:01:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @WhiteHouse @POTUS And not a single Trump brand.
887015441905967106 2017-07-17 18:25:35 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Your ignorance of politics is in full view to the world. Why continue to advertise it?
886764417433702400 2017-07-16 01:48:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump When? After you recover for three or four days from your traveling. I know how hard it is on an old man.
886591765104533504 2017-07-16 14:22:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump How come you have over 38 million followers and barely ever get 10% likes?
886590823793610752 2017-07-16 14:18:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Is his check in the mail?
886590722681569280 2017-07-16 14:17:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump It was about women's golf, not you, you dolt.
886388957487013889 2017-07-15 00:56:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The fastest since 2014. Woopty doo wow.
886342353790935040 2017-07-15 21:50:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @AKADonaldTrump They hate him because he's gay.
886341443828297729 2017-07-15 21:47:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And the Trump name credibility  hit an all time low.

885925088519913472 2017-07-14 18:12:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @PeterBeinart @julialillie In his case pretty much everything he says is projection.
885924664765231104 2017-07-14 18:11:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueSNRadvisor Yeah. Kind of like the Berlin Wall.
885923395501740033 2017-07-14 18:06:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump He is as transparent as a brick wall. And just as intelligent.
885922995839148036 2017-07-14 18:04:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @calvinstowell @altun_diyar Tournament officials asked him not to attend. They said it would be too disruptive.
885922625788293120 2017-07-14 18:03:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They asked you not to attend.
885903829589532672 2017-07-14 16:48:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Ha ha ha ha!!!!
885680331029979137 2017-07-13 02:00:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @votevets Junior is 39. Emmanel Macron is 39.
885594481126518784 2017-07-13 20:19:12 UTC <BethTedder1> @CNNSitRoom @Acosta Pun intended :)
885337281715998721 2017-07-12 03:17:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That'll cover what...about 50 miles of wall? HA! Big win my ass.
885322580936327169 2017-07-12 02:18:46 UTC <BethTedder1> Shouldn't there be video or record of Natalia Veselnitskaya entering and leaving Trump Tower? Just to check how long she was really there?

885147757182320640 2017-07-12 14:44:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Very similar to "All my friends are doing it so why can't I"

885144726122487813 2017-07-12 14:32:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Yeah but all that is fake news. This is real news.
884939889053233153 2017-07-11 00:58:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @jaketapper @EricTrump Yeah, your dad and sister Ivanka are obviously very, very close. You and Don, second fiddles.
884907512528588800 2017-07-11 22:49:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @limbaugh @DonaldJTrumpJr @MedianPolitics DTjr. You said if a Republican did this Dems would be calling for the electric chair. You are a Repub. You did it. ELECTRIC CHAIR!!

884832840059367424 2017-07-11 17:52:43 UTC <BethTedder1> It's so funny how @realDonaldTrump defends @IvankaTrump over shoes yet leaves @DonaldJTrumpJr  to twist in the wind.
884772901844652033 2017-07-11 13:54:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @DonaldJTrumpJr You made a really stupid mistake, for which you and your father will pay. Get used to it. Get ready. You lawyered up which proves it.

884489064405184512 2017-07-10 19:06:40 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @RoguePOTUSStaff @Ninkurra I stand corrected.
884477450843021312 2017-07-10 18:20:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff I doubt the word 'adoption' was even spoken during the meeting.
884405129407025152 2017-07-10 13:33:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump So, it was ok for Ivanka to hold your seat while you gave our country away.
884404869003661313 2017-07-10 13:32:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump They don't care. That's why. Where is YOUR big, beautiful plan?
884404584864731136 2017-07-10 13:30:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods Why would you retweet something from a Hollywood elite? You hate them.
884404307411578881 2017-07-10 13:29:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Why would you even entertain or discuss something so treasonous and absurd? Oh, yeah. Never mind.
884403903407771648 2017-07-10 13:28:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No thanks to Jordan, of course.
884403737057472512 2017-07-10 13:27:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And for years they had no plan. And still don't.
884403542873837568 2017-07-10 13:26:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Then you were derelict in your duty if you did not discuss sanctions.
884096724054290432 2017-07-09 17:07:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That cease-fire has been in the works  through Jordan and Russia. Not through you.
884095774358990850 2017-07-09 17:03:52 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And why the hell not?!?!
884095562601156611 2017-07-09 17:03:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Why was Putin asking this and why was it any of his business?
884095134270447618 2017-07-09 17:01:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Joint statement Oct. 7, 2016 from DNI Director Clapper and DHS Secretary Johnson spoke on behalf of the USIC which includes all 17 agencies.

883835056896319493 2017-07-08 23:47:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Ok, so what was the outcome of your meeting?
883482167233441792 2017-07-07 00:25:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @VP No he isn't.  He's too busy tweeting stupid stuff about John Podesta.

883416479261216770 2017-07-07 20:04:36 UTC <BethTedder1> It's getting pretty bad when you believe Russia's version of the meeting over the U.S. version.

883332236698955776 2017-07-07 14:29:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Your juvenile attitude and lack of incompetence is showing again.
882582558340415488 2017-07-05 12:50:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You sure give up easily. But who knew diplomacy was hard.
882581781421195264 2017-07-05 12:47:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump I know you are so excited to meet Putin. Of course you said you already met him. Which is true? Or do you even know? Or care?
882581149813551105 2017-07-05 12:45:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You have no conception of what helps us or hurts us. Sheer ignorance.
882580778336620544 2017-07-05 12:43:49 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump I thought you were a dealmaker. Looks more like you are a failure.
882441718326546433 2017-07-04 03:31:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @McFaul @maggieNYT @stevenleemyers There are way too many big words and concepts in there for Trump to understand. He would never get past the first sentence.

876559377733480449 2017-06-18 21:56:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Liar. Remember this? "Camp David is very rustic, it's nice, you'd like it. You know how long you'd like it? For about 30 minutes."

876058870354989056 2017-06-17 12:48:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff And most of those despise him but want to see what crap he posts.
876057528471347200 2017-06-17 12:42:45 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You have no friends.
875694153593761792 2017-06-16 12:38:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @GlennKesslerWP People and institutions were hacked by the Russians...but not Hillary's server or phones. Sounds like she was extremely careful.

843114248460996610 2017-03-18 14:57:55 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We saw you treat her like crap. You're going to pay for how you treat women.
842831272288370692 2017-03-17 20:13:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff I could have sworn the UK stated that they had been assured the claim would not be raised again.

842587304552103937 2017-03-16 04:04:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump How ridiculous! Everyone knows Hispanics don't work!
842376988413308929 2017-03-16 14:08:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta I think he did. He is just not angry enough that it surfaced. And Jr.  has done nothing but crow about it.
842121712468647943 2017-03-15 21:13:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump No, real news. Fake tax returns you leaked to press pretending you actually paid taxes.
842120258190204928 2017-03-15 21:08:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff I agree. He's not mad enough for someone else to have leaked them.
841840622688448512 2017-03-14 02:36:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @mattbai @GlennKesslerWP  Subtle and appropriate dig. I approve.

839486747050409984 2017-03-08 14:43:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Then why do you treat your wife like crap in public? We see you. No respect at all.
839268846481600514 2017-03-07 00:17:40 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You lie.
839259149171056640 2017-03-07 23:39:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @jaketapper At what point does the deepening lack of credibility of our President reach a complete inability for him to govern our country?
839124124735799297 2017-03-07 14:42:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff This has to stop. The country is in chaos because of this mentally ill man.
839121955605315585 2017-03-07 14:33:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The news isn't telling us. Your Administration is. Are they 'fake staff'?
838543080949178368 2017-03-05 00:13:44 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff He's not emotionally or mentally equipped to deal with this kind of pressure. He's on overload.
838529690864402432 2017-03-05 23:20:32 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff I think he is livid because Sessions was his insurance policy within the Justice Department.
838487113020682241 2017-03-05 20:31:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump What rallies?

837707421187469313 2017-03-03 16:53:07 UTC <BethTedder1> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Like you read an actual book. Liar. Fake story.
837706678707621888 2017-03-03 16:50:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump What's pathetic is you have not nominated anyone for a tenth of the offices you need to fill. What is your problem?
837496563463294976 2017-03-02 02:55:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Sessions lied. Lied. Lied. Lied. And you nominated a liar.
837495225446723585 2017-03-02 02:49:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Your cabinet is incompetent. Your advisors are incompetent. Every aspect of your 'so-called' presidency is incompetent.
837305353880600576 2017-03-02 14:15:27 UTC <BethTedder1> @CharlesMBlow It happens more often than anyone thinks. Grief, familiarity, consolation, shared memories, provide comfort to both.

837153608974151680 2017-03-01 04:12:28 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta Yes. Sessions must resign.
837152773007376386 2017-03-01 04:09:09 UTC <BethTedder1> Jeff Sessions must resign.
836964009219874816 2017-03-01 15:39:04 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff It's tongue-in-cheek...
836748498322227201 2017-02-28 01:22:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @RogueSNRadvisor Is he calling Central Casting again?
836745189075070978 2017-02-28 01:09:33 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff No offense, but I don't think anyone in their right mind thinks President Obama is behind leaks. Leaving out Donald.

836030554806042624 2017-02-26 01:49:51 UTC <BethTedder1> @markknoller Journalists should start using the name 'John Barron' as a pseudonym for their source.
835918432923181057 2017-02-26 18:24:19 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump This fake news whine is getting tiresome. Isn't here something else you can bitch about

833898085327712260 2017-02-20 04:36:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @Smiling_Trina I agree. This is like FB used to be before we got the emoticons.
833880647831842816 2017-02-20 03:26:53 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff Of course he's a danger to this entire country. But there is little we can do. We ridicule him to lessen the stress.

832789471993135104 2017-02-17 03:10:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @Acosta Sole purpose of doing this is to restrict access and forcibly remove citizens who do not support Trump. Protesters=trespassers.

832631735762427904 2017-02-17 16:44:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The real media is not happy either.
832631515771068420 2017-02-17 16:43:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump In other words the Craigslist candidate list must be pretty slim right now.
832631149226815488 2017-02-17 16:41:50 UTC <BethTedder1> @POTUS @FoxNews Donald must have read that poll backwards yesterday.

832041138743869441 2017-02-15 01:37:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @ZekeJMiller What campaign? The race is run. Victor installed. No campaign exists now.
832040788829810689 2017-02-15 01:35:57 UTC <BethTedder1> Donald is sad and he needs a shot of adulation. Little does he know what will await him in Florida.https://twitter.com/RogueSNRadvisor/status/831981126734405633

830882550600056832 2017-02-12 20:53:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Not according to your ICE officials. Who is lying? You? Them? Come on...which is it?
830881518356746241 2017-02-12 20:49:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That was the worst script-reading I have ever seen. Except for yours.

830581456137240577 2017-02-11 00:57:05 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump It's a damn shame you dragged her into all your mess because you couldn't be President by yourself.
830580739330670592 2017-02-11 00:54:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump How much did it cost you to get Melania to show up? A blue box?
830579751047819264 2017-02-11 00:50:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump There is no winter White House. There is only one White House. And you are not there. You are vacationing.
830543860778545154 2017-02-11 22:27:41 UTC <BethTedder1> @RoguePOTUSStaff Shake it off. You are recording history that may never see sunlight...at least not during the next few years.

830489569392988160 2017-02-11 18:51:57 UTC <BethTedder1> @politico @mike_pence  Pence should have kept his mouth shut until he knew the 'alternative facts'.
830425358021304320 2017-02-11 14:36:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump What are you gonna do? Offer the contractors 30% of their invoices?
830424504216252417 2017-02-11 14:33:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump More people in the US die from their own dog killing them than from refugees.
830250880041623552 2017-02-10 03:03:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @AbeShinzo  Our most sincere apologies for this dolt who is pretending to be a President.
830222126544207872 2017-02-10 01:09:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's because that particular point was moot, given the rest of the lawlessness in the EO.

817729960634892288 2017-01-07 13:49:49 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Not according to intelligence report. RNC WAS hacked also. Do you think we cannot read?
817490229800091648 2017-01-06 21:57:13 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Whoop-de-doo. Are you interviewing them for Cabinet? If not...get to work!
817489599136198656 2017-01-06 21:54:43 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That information must have been covered in one of the intelligence briefings you skipped. You watched Apprentice instead?
817443341784772614 2017-01-06 18:50:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And while you're at it, investigate how Giuliani knew about Comey letter. Criminal!
817442394924843016 2017-01-06 18:47:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Don't you have more important things to do? Grow up!
817441597587595266 2017-01-06 18:43:58 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Passion. Combined with no compassion. Combined with gullibility. Combined with self-centeredness. Equals Trump voters.
817440208794845185 2017-01-06 18:38:27 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump The factual media is ignoring this because they consider your "wall" to be a lie and a joke. Will never happen.
817175525231837188 2017-01-05 01:06:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Whined about like a true clown...with a wig and orange facepaint.
817174599225974785 2017-01-05 01:03:01 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are now a politician, Donald. You'd better figure this stuff out fast.
817173395003637760 2017-01-05 00:58:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are the one who says you know a lot about hacking. So what is your knowledgeable assessment?
817172926155935745 2017-01-05 00:56:22 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Did it ever cross your mind that good jobs in Mexico keep Mexican workers there? Instead of here?
817172393634500609 2017-01-05 00:54:15 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And if you tweet a quote from Stalin does that mean you are simply stating for the hell of it? Or because you agree?
817171336833462274 2017-01-05 00:50:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump A big fan of intelligence?!? Is that like being a big fan of Kiss or the Patriots or something?!?
816807845308076032 2017-01-04 00:45:40 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You lower yourself to use a young girl as a political pawn in your game? Poor Jackie.
816653435189731328 2017-01-04 14:32:06 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Do you actually know ANYTHING about ANYTHING in this country? Do you even CARE?
816652862923096065 2017-01-04 14:29:49 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump If I told you the earth was flat, would you tweet that to the entire world?
816246297783074816 2017-01-03 11:34:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Go to your intelligence briefings instead of reading the Enquirer.
816238912125435904 2017-01-03 11:04:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And you profit from China? Cutting off your own nose again?
816050581127254016 2017-01-02 22:36:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You had no idea and neither did anyone else.
816050001143070720 2017-01-02 22:34:16 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump For God's sake MOVE ON! You are going to be President and no one cares about that anymore!
815300529148530689 2016-12-31 20:56:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Just what we need for a Commander-in-Chief...a drama Queen who calls his fellow Americans losers.
815085135536287744 2016-12-30 06:40:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @JimBrownNFL32 @AmerIcan32 @realDonaldTrump This is a joke party...right?
815082917953159172 2016-12-30 06:31:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @FoxNews @NBCNews @CNN @realDonaldTrump Russia is playing YOU for a fool and YOU don't have a clue.
814928165646823425 2016-12-30 20:16:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump What exactly has Putin promised you? It is apparent you have been bought.
814642404112338945 2016-12-29 01:20:59 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @KeithOlbermann Don't put yourself out or anything, Donald. Just whenever you have a spare minute.
814173042867916801 2016-12-28 18:15:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Won't be a thing you can do about it. Already voted on. Do you intend to take on the UN? You will lose...loser.
814172182154739712 2016-12-28 18:12:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Sure we can. Just like they treated those innocent little boys on the beach when they blew their arms and legs off.
814171468225449985 2016-12-28 18:09:39 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Speaking of inflammatory...look up self-immolation. Practice makes perfect.
814170842074640388 2016-12-28 18:07:09 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are so foolish and childish, how can any adult even respond to you without sounding like a third-grader?
813606475830620160 2016-12-26 04:44:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Do you have to whine about EVERYTHING?
813604604327985152 2016-12-26 04:37:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Mommy! They won't let me in their club! Waaaah!!!
813603912079069184 2016-12-26 04:34:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump And they aren't going to let you in their club. They don't like you.
813601636958486528 2016-12-26 04:25:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump DJT Foundation was your own private slush fund. And you got caught using it. You are guilty. Get used to it.
812817235555270656 2016-12-24 00:28:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews So?!?
812816928205131778 2016-12-24 00:27:11 UTC <BethTedder1> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Jesus was born tonight and you are hawking a TV show?!? Shame!!
812814502009958400 2016-12-24 00:17:33 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump No you won't. There will be no peace until Netanyahu is gone.
812812436923383809 2016-12-24 00:09:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump that's because the first part of your statement is so ignorant no one is paying attention to the second part.
812445492118482944 2016-12-23 23:51:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Dylann Roof laughed & said 'somebody had to do it' referring to his slaughter of 9 Americans. This was purely racist.
812441787600080896 2016-12-23 23:36:31 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump hopefully they will hold a vote to condemn you.
812441188565450753 2016-12-23 23:34:08 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump sure he can..he just can't sell access to the Presidency for charity. NO PAY FOR PLAY. Remember?
812439873051357184 2016-12-23 23:28:54 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump For God's sake MOVE ON, you baby!
812087087608565760 2016-12-22 00:07:04 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump It only takes one to incinerate millions of people. Russia will drop the first on you. Don't worry...you'll never know it.
811592750315569152 2016-12-21 15:22:44 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump That's because NO ONE cares.
811380305575682049 2016-12-20 01:18:34 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Then why did you talk crap about him?
811057713098747904 2016-12-19 03:56:42 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Then start talking like you won a Presidency instead of a grade-school student council contest.
810619504149532673 2016-12-18 22:55:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You knew all along about Russia's hacking. You colluded with them. You will go down for treason.
810614555705479168 2016-12-18 22:35:45 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You are so terribly unprecedential.
810614016859054080 2016-12-18 22:33:36 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Are you that stupid? Who do you think we are emulating? It's about time we fought fire with fire!
810318491123335169 2016-12-17 02:59:17 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You would cry 'UNCLE' and give away our technology to the 'enemy'?!? Cut off your own nose?!?
809577189545013248 2016-12-15 01:53:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @VanityFair @realDonaldTrump Grow up, you short-fingered vulgarian.
809573049095884800 2016-12-15 01:37:10 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @kurteichenwald His memory is short...much like his penis.
809572514657607681 2016-12-15 01:35:03 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Actually it is complex...unlike you.
808728525872254978 2016-12-13 17:41:20 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You'd better have Pick #2 ready because he'll never be confirmed.
808728014821478400 2016-12-13 17:39:18 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Are you lying about that like you have lied about all the rest of your promises?
808483134517944320 2016-12-12 01:26:14 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Apparently your memory is as short as your weiner.
808482426859245568 2016-12-12 01:23:26 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump You're such a child. You really think that you can change that, don't you?
807781206939041792 2016-12-10 02:57:02 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump We want you to fly in YOUR plane instead. With no upgrades.Please oh please.
807780175169679364 2016-12-10 02:52:56 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump @CNN Not according to Kellyanne. Are you lying or is she?
807779564663480320 2016-12-10 02:50:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Not according to Kellyanne. Are you lying or is she?
806694992722923520 2016-12-07 03:00:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @NYCMayor Cut off police security. Let SS handle it themselves or Trump private security.
804916700596633600 2016-12-02 05:14:30 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Our President-elect needs an updated copy of "Foreign Policy For Dummies"

798747042520694784 2016-11-15 04:38:29 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Give us a break. You don't even know what the positions are or what they do.
798233740463968256 2016-11-14 18:38:48 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Get over it. Debates are old news now.
798232889049710592 2016-11-14 18:35:25 UTC <BethTedder1> @ananavarro And Giuliani leaked FBI info in national TV. Egad!!!

795424623034769414 2016-11-06 00:36:23 UTC <BethTedder1> @realDonaldTrump Mommy took away your toy, you bad little boy. Now sending you away to military school?!?
794267812449513472 2016-11-03 19:59:37 UTC <BethTedder1> @ananavarro No disgrace to vote for HRC. Respected Republicans are. I respect your indecision but please rebuke Trump this one last time.
