944948247705063424 2017-12-24 15:09:53 UTC <_nuomahs_> America actually had a statue dedicated to the terrorist group responsible for thousands of (Black) deaths. And I have yet to see or hear of a statue commemorating all of those killed through racial injustice in this country.https://twitter.com/tariqnasheed/status/944675683183222784
943914849070997504 2017-12-21 18:43:31 UTC <_nuomahs_> This isnt forcing anything. Its representation, and that matters. If representation scares you, yes youre homophobic. https://twitter.com/og__herbo/status/943330275987279872

940795288679342080 2017-12-12 04:07:30 UTC <_nuomahs_> What happens today will be the history our kids learn from tomorrow. Take a stand, share your voice, empower others, and leave this place better than you found it
940794727733088257 2017-12-12 04:05:16 UTC <_nuomahs_> And it is horrifying to see the epitome of rich white male privilege sit in the White House without any punishment to the outstanding number of atrocities committed and said. There is no place for people like Trump or Roy Moore. Not in the America of tomorrow.
940793988587622401 2017-12-12 04:02:20 UTC <_nuomahs_> It disgusts me that we are able to live with the fact that voter suppression still happens. Black people being denied the right to vote is STILL happening. Violation of voting rights isnt in the past, and systemic racism perpetuates it everyday.
940792954804940800 2017-12-12 03:58:14 UTC <_nuomahs_> What a country we live in where the entire nation was watching to see who would win an election. The democrat or the child molester and sexual predator. The fact that Roy Moore was able to run at all is worrying. The fact that he had a chance is even scarier. This isnt okay.
