746461560441188352 2016-06-24 21:54:39 UTC <SheRevSEA> @leannepreed It is practice many places. Totally agree. Just not rule.
746460830464507904 2016-06-24 21:51:45 UTC <SheRevSEA> @svanceocampo I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with the overture itself. Simply the statement that "spouses can't serve."
746460459990028288 2016-06-24 21:50:16 UTC <SheRevSEA> @svanceocampo There are some congregations who will call/ordain/install spouses.
746460294407303168 2016-06-24 21:49:37 UTC <SheRevSEA> @svanceocampo I hear that, but there's no rule against it as someone used in their argument.

708685281495351296 2016-03-12 16:05:12 UTC <SheRevSEA> "We know Christ and his ministry from knowing you." That might just be the highest praise a pastor can get. (Heard at presbytery)

690732176804044800 2016-01-22 03:05:58 UTC <SheRevSEA> @ladyrev03 @Target I do not know. It seems that what is stocked should be regionally appropriate.
690731988093947904 2016-01-22 03:05:13 UTC <SheRevSEA> It's one of those nights when you have to have a glass or two of wine because the recipe called for 1 tbsp and now the bottle is open.
690617958880571392 2016-01-22 19:32:07 UTC <SheRevSEA> I hate when @Target stops stocking snow pants in January. This is WI. Winter has only just begun and kids play hard in winter gear.
