955216071392464896 2018-01-21 23:10:33 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood I expected him to kinda cave and revert to the Bortles of old. It's also New England's experience. They've been there so many times they probably felt zero pressure in the 4th.
955215300789788673 2018-01-21 23:07:29 UTC <kylehakk> @JasonPinkstonOL Especially with Robinson back next year.

952658101475446784 2018-01-14 21:46:05 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood With Cowher's leftovers. I refuse to believe he had that much influence on that team. He just had to keep things afloat and the talent would do the rest.
952657448049041409 2018-01-14 21:43:29 UTC <kylehakk> @Nate13Burleson is such a great analyst. Probably been my favorite part of this football season, especially as a Browns fan.
952655298292011008 2018-01-14 21:34:57 UTC <kylehakk> Mike Tomlin is the Marty Schottenheimer of the Steelers. Good enough to not get fired, not good enough to get the job done. Extremely questionable decisions when it matters most.

951503399102615554 2018-01-11 17:17:43 UTC <kylehakk> The fact that there's a giant storm coming after this beautiful day sums up life in general.
951230967565504512 2018-01-10 23:15:10 UTC <kylehakk> @leahoh4 I had to second guess myself because it is Fear Factor and maybe they had a challenge to eat clothes.

950388481800404994 2018-01-08 15:27:26 UTC <kylehakk> @hulu_support when will the Golden Globes be put on Hulu? I am a Live subscriber as well and set it to DVR, just in case it wasn't on the next day, but it didn't record either. Please help.
950358769304854529 2018-01-08 13:29:22 UTC <kylehakk> I left for work about an hour ago. I only made it route 84 and turned around and took State Rd back to the harbor. One hour of driving for what's a fifteen minute trip? Jeeze.

949715150822608896 2018-01-06 18:51:51 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 Same. The first two seasons are the best because Adam has this squeaky ass voice and it's ten times cuter than puberty.
949712473598423040 2018-01-06 18:41:13 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 Gotcha. I've watched it all up until the most recent season. It stopped being funny to me. Every episode is just about how sad the mom is that her kids are growing up and I got bored.

947848812969844736 2018-01-01 15:15:41 UTC <kylehakk> The fact that Jim Caldwell has fewer losses in 4 years (and he got fired) than Hue has in 2 is insane. How do you let this continue? #Browns

934885566344323073 2017-11-26 20:44:23 UTC <kylehakk> So basically they just had to let him catch that pass because hitting him at all is a penalty. I'm still not over it.
934884735158976512 2017-11-26 20:41:04 UTC <kylehakk> @KenCarman This league is trash.

934870173705822210 2017-11-26 19:43:13 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood A lot of people. I listen to 92.3 on my way to work and there were so many angry callers. WE NEED A QB, WHAT ARE THEY THINKING, LOCAL KID!
934869390738231297 2017-11-26 19:40:06 UTC <kylehakk> It's such a Browns thing to have a great run D, and go up against the worst rushing team in the league and make them look like absolute monsters.
934867852397604864 2017-11-26 19:33:59 UTC <kylehakk> I remember when people were pissed that we passed on Trubisky lol
934851951484948480 2017-11-26 18:30:48 UTC <kylehakk> I knew they'd call the penalty on just the Browns despite it being both sides.

933380943162826752 2017-11-22 17:05:32 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery It's weird that I'm the only progressive thinking one here. Out of thirty people, I don't have a single person who identifies with my values. It really sucks.
933350593598558208 2017-11-22 15:04:56 UTC <kylehakk> Another quote from new guy at work: "I call CNN the Communist News Network. They'll brainwash the shit out of you. The only honest news network is Fox News." Just kill me.
933092463396380673 2017-11-21 21:59:13 UTC <kylehakk> Actual quote from new guy at work : "I quit watching football ever since they started protesting the military. How can you be against the people that keep your country safe?" BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. I give up on humans.

929895081393512448 2017-11-12 02:13:58 UTC <kylehakk> Finally saw the video of that Vontaze ejection call. Total bullshit.
929816486633406465 2017-11-12 21:01:40 UTC <kylehakk> At least we're not the Bills, I guess.
929814867825045506 2017-11-12 20:55:14 UTC <kylehakk> I like how the announcers totally made excuses why that wasn't pass interference.
929814325023395842 2017-11-12 20:53:04 UTC <kylehakk> No reason for Kizer to be in there. Let's just go home.

922192930672128001 2017-10-22 20:08:22 UTC <kylehakk> Joe Thomas going out really deflated our tires.
922192621279334404 2017-10-22 20:07:09 UTC <kylehakk> 1st down is just relegated to Crowell up the middle for 1-2 yards.

922185522952462336 2017-10-22 19:38:56 UTC <kylehakk> I just want the ball in @DukeJohnson_8 and @David_Njoku80 hands. Hurricanes win games. @MiamiHurricanes #Browns
922182030246498304 2017-10-22 19:25:03 UTC <kylehakk> Time to win.
922175209918156801 2017-10-22 18:57:57 UTC <kylehakk> Nice drive though. Started off at the 1.
922174844950728705 2017-10-22 18:56:30 UTC <kylehakk> We gotta win it for Joe
922174038621016065 2017-10-22 18:53:18 UTC <kylehakk> We're so cursed. Finally a beautiful drive and then Thomas goes down. I can't believe our luck
922173746051502081 2017-10-22 18:52:08 UTC <kylehakk> Joe Thomas! Nooooooo!!
922173562164858880 2017-10-22 18:51:25 UTC <kylehakk> We'd be 4-2 if we started Kessler.
922173225643192322 2017-10-22 18:50:04 UTC <kylehakk> I love it!

922170900572725248 2017-10-22 18:40:50 UTC <kylehakk> @JaycrawfordCLE He needs to be the lead back. Too much talent to just be the third down back.

922166389821050880 2017-10-22 18:22:55 UTC <kylehakk> I don't get Kizer. It's like he goes blind when he's near the end zone. Put in Kessler whenever we get inside the 25.
922157157763768320 2017-10-22 17:46:13 UTC <kylehakk> I love the Ingram/Kamara tandem so much #GoSaints
921830024830947328 2017-10-21 20:06:19 UTC <kylehakk> My biggest guilty pleasure is the handicap bathroom stall. One day I'm going to feel like a dick when a kid in a wheelchair shits himself.

921083189355008004 2017-10-19 18:38:39 UTC <kylehakk> @carnifex In Coalesce with Filth and Faith. Always been my favorite track. Such a great album though.
921082848903344130 2017-10-19 18:37:18 UTC <kylehakk> I think listening to ADIDAS by Korn at age 10 really shaped me into the man I am today.

919663918326435841 2017-10-15 20:38:59 UTC <kylehakk> Hearing announcers talk about Cam Erving like he's God's gift to man is weird.
919657630884352000 2017-10-15 20:14:00 UTC <kylehakk> The Jets got fucking fucked. Wowwwww.
919644937666383873 2017-10-15 19:23:33 UTC <kylehakk> We're back in it now!
919633160220135424 2017-10-15 18:36:46 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord Tarik Cohen threw a better pass than anything Hogan has done all day.
919632789762437120 2017-10-15 18:35:17 UTC <kylehakk> Jimmy Haslam has to fire Hue. The halftime crew are just laughing about how bad the Browns are.
919632484907831297 2017-10-15 18:34:05 UTC <kylehakk> I hate halftime because I just get to see functional football teams and it makes me sad that I can't have that.
919631914411098112 2017-10-15 18:31:48 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood Can't be any worse
919629298088194048 2017-10-15 18:21:25 UTC <kylehakk> It's time for GOATy Kessler to come in. Fuck these other guys. At least we were mildly competitive last year.
919628966012641280 2017-10-15 18:20:06 UTC <kylehakk> @Goldust I'm glad I'm not the only one who doesn't like the number 5.
919627220099969025 2017-10-15 18:13:09 UTC <kylehakk> Fuck the Browns.
919623467498164224 2017-10-15 17:58:15 UTC <kylehakk> The thing is, this game just keeps getting easier to win, and we just keep looking worse and worse.
919622809629978625 2017-10-15 17:55:38 UTC <kylehakk> This shit is over. Bring in the dancing lobsters.
919620445955153920 2017-10-15 17:46:14 UTC <kylehakk> God damn, that pass would have even been high for Devalve.
919620148721577984 2017-10-15 17:45:03 UTC <kylehakk> Josh McCown is the real fucking deal.

917580758230945792 2017-10-09 02:41:15 UTC <kylehakk> It's nuts that the Indians aren't going to advance in the playoffs.
917516434682646528 2017-10-09 22:25:39 UTC <kylehakk> @xDIAMONDCUTx @StrengthOfFates I'm on board with Dream Warriors being the best until that skeleton karate fight in the junkyard. That's the only reason I like 1 more.
917516075281076226 2017-10-09 22:24:13 UTC <kylehakk> I really like when Christmas decorations outnumber the Halloween decorations on October 9th. Just kidding.
917198331679518720 2017-10-08 01:21:37 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord Dak saved my life.
917162141425328128 2017-10-08 22:57:49 UTC <kylehakk> It sometimes bothers me that I'll never be as cool as Tegan OR Sara.
917132595330248704 2017-10-08 21:00:24 UTC <kylehakk> You know what makes me the most sad? Everything.
917132397514317825 2017-10-08 20:59:37 UTC <kylehakk> Can you imagine how good we would have looked with McCown under center?
917117199281737728 2017-10-08 19:59:14 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood More "ugh"
917117145116528641 2017-10-08 19:59:01 UTC <kylehakk> I said we'd go 3-13. But our wins would come early. We're beyond the easy part of the schedule now. We're going 0-16.
917116910822621185 2017-10-08 19:58:05 UTC <kylehakk> Maybe if we didn't have two missed field goals... Ugh.
917116046989037569 2017-10-08 19:54:39 UTC <kylehakk> Duuuuuuuuke!
917110468954722309 2017-10-08 19:32:29 UTC <kylehakk> Great time for the defense to fucking play like trash. We suck. Fuck this.
917109889415241728 2017-10-08 19:30:11 UTC <kylehakk> I picked Pittsburgh in my survival pool. So I'm eliminated. But also it's okay because fuck them.
917107720783876096 2017-10-08 19:21:34 UTC <kylehakk> He took a timeout to call THAT?!

917097192732622849 2017-10-08 18:39:44 UTC <kylehakk> Damn. Hue listened to me. Thanks, Coach.
917094149718978560 2017-10-08 18:27:38 UTC <kylehakk> We should put Hogan in. Just to see what happens.
917091986221535233 2017-10-08 18:19:02 UTC <kylehakk> You can't make this shit up. We're fucking cursed.
917090517086851072 2017-10-08 18:13:12 UTC <kylehakk> I called 3 sacks at the beginning of the game. Ask my dad. He'll prove it.

917088676051595264 2017-10-08 18:05:53 UTC <kylehakk> Kizer cannot finish a drive.
917088632657338369 2017-10-08 18:05:43 UTC <kylehakk> There's a god damn force field blocking us from the end zone.

917082406456348675 2017-10-08 17:40:58 UTC <kylehakk> Defense is looking fantastic, but too bad we can't score.
917081479582281728 2017-10-08 17:37:17 UTC <kylehakk> HE TAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER.
917079408262959106 2017-10-08 17:29:04 UTC <kylehakk> I called that shit. I feel partly responsible
917077074376093697 2017-10-08 17:19:47 UTC <kylehakk> Our receivers are so bad. You can see Kizer going through all his reads, just about every snap. Nobody can get open. Sad.
917075463692083205 2017-10-08 17:13:23 UTC <kylehakk> I'm still pumped up from that @MylesLGarrett sack.

916843254800441344 2017-10-07 01:50:40 UTC <kylehakk> I eat at Compadres every Saturday if anyone wants to ever hang out in a safe space and talk about feelings.
916428779249197056 2017-10-06 22:23:42 UTC <kylehakk> Kluber is fucking garbage.
916372289402359808 2017-10-06 18:39:13 UTC <kylehakk> @xDIAMONDCUTx @themeanmackean Give out individual pieces of candy corn. 3 dollars for a whole night's worth of passing out candy.
916263389105655808 2017-10-06 11:26:29 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 I just want to point out that I was always against it.

915759358037946368 2017-10-04 02:03:39 UTC <kylehakk> There's so many better horror movies on Hulu than Netflix. Netflix kinda sucks outside of it's originals. And I don't care about most of em.
914832585683083264 2017-10-02 12:40:59 UTC <kylehakk> I hate how alcohol keeps me awake. It's 7:30, I went to bed at 3 AM. I'm still slightly drunk and breakfast starts soon, but I'm spinning.

912067580936015873 2017-09-24 21:33:51 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood They did during the game today. Guy came in kinda late during a slide and our lineman got in his face.
912064395383066626 2017-09-24 21:21:11 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 I honestly drive across town if I ever want McDonald's.

912063373831016448 2017-09-24 21:17:08 UTC <kylehakk> @Browns @EByner Every week the defense is soft in the first half, and then shutdown in the second. I think it's the TO's on offense.
912049704439033862 2017-09-24 20:22:49 UTC <kylehakk> CHICAGO!
912048942577324032 2017-09-24 20:19:47 UTC <kylehakk> Hue needs to be relieved of play calling duties. He can be a fine head coach, but his play calling is terrible.
912048563189878784 2017-09-24 20:18:17 UTC <kylehakk> Great fucking play call, Hue. Jesus Christ. Shit head.
912046490310381569 2017-09-24 20:10:02 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood Well, it's close now.
912045729757188100 2017-09-24 20:07:01 UTC <kylehakk> These drops are driving me insane. Holy shit.
912039261188317184 2017-09-24 19:41:19 UTC <kylehakk> Why stick with Kizer still?
912035486226632704 2017-09-24 19:26:19 UTC <kylehakk> I see a lot of blame on Britt, but Kizer has to get the ball in front of him. That was an easy first down but he was way behind.
912034971363287041 2017-09-24 19:24:16 UTC <kylehakk> So at what point do we consider throwing Hogan in there?
912022445426724867 2017-09-24 18:34:30 UTC <kylehakk> How mad are we gonna be when Josh McCown torches us next week?
912021764913364993 2017-09-24 18:31:47 UTC <kylehakk>  @Jles9 
912019212075495426 2017-09-24 18:21:39 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood This is insane. I didn't expect us to look this bad.
912016936204161024 2017-09-24 18:12:36 UTC <kylehakk> Peppers looked awful, Taylor didn't even try. That was really bad to watch.
912014335798579201 2017-09-24 18:02:16 UTC <kylehakk> Can't wait for that gif
912010483162640385 2017-09-24 17:46:58 UTC <kylehakk> Duuuuuuuuuuke!
912008903973572611 2017-09-24 17:40:41 UTC <kylehakk> Yep. We're losing this game.
911960470965321731 2017-09-24 14:28:14 UTC <kylehakk> I can't believe how bad Baltimore looks. Guess you're not that elite when you don't play two of the worst teams back to back.
911953023395561472 2017-09-24 13:58:38 UTC <kylehakk> Jacksonville is making Baltimore look silly. That feels weird to even type out.
911747770939269120 2017-09-23 00:23:02 UTC <kylehakk> Latinas have the most beautiful hair. I'm in love.

910897862799740930 2017-09-21 16:05:48 UTC <kylehakk> Listening to Alkaline Trio at work. It's been a good 13 years since I last listened to them. Soundtrack to my 14 year old life.

909884866707247104 2017-09-18 21:00:31 UTC <kylehakk> @HEELReport They could make such a cool set design with today's technology, too. I've been dreaming of it coming back for awhile now.

909508540674473984 2017-09-17 20:05:08 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood It'll be close
909507677042114560 2017-09-17 20:01:42 UTC <kylehakk> Sad thing is, we might not beat the Colts next week.
909507012714692608 2017-09-17 19:59:04 UTC <kylehakk> Should have kept Hogan in, honestly. I'm starting to switch to the camp of Kizer isn't ready. Week 1 was a fluke.
909503317365153793 2017-09-17 19:44:23 UTC <kylehakk> He's young, I try not to be hard on him

909495696935579648 2017-09-17 19:14:06 UTC <kylehakk> We need to strike while Yanda is out. They're not moving the ball at all. Take advantage of it.
909485155097698304 2017-09-17 18:32:13 UTC <kylehakk> Fuck. What a total meltdown in under 30 seconds.
909484701726990336 2017-09-17 18:30:24 UTC <kylehakk> Hogan gets leveled. My god.
909484371844968450 2017-09-17 18:29:06 UTC <kylehakk> How long has that been a rule?
909483836387545093 2017-09-17 18:26:58 UTC <kylehakk> Let Hogan go wild. Ball at midfield with a minute to go. No reason to not get a score from this.
909478460925587461 2017-09-17 18:05:37 UTC <kylehakk> QB CONTROVERSY

907360669170839552 2017-09-11 21:50:16 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery :(
906978928329359368 2017-09-10 20:33:22 UTC <kylehakk> Ravens, Colts, Bengals, Jets, Texans, Titans. Those are very winnable games.
906977106407694342 2017-09-10 20:26:07 UTC <kylehakk> They deserved it. For sure.https://twitter.com/EmptySeatsPics/status/906974070562017283
906972018565840897 2017-09-10 20:05:54 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 @LarryTheSusLord Me and Jordan already discussed that it'll be you and Kiki's Revenge in the finals.
906971198650703872 2017-09-10 20:02:39 UTC <kylehakk> I don't miss Joe Haden the football player. But I miss the positivity, swagger, and leadership. I'm still sad.
906970789513134082 2017-09-10 20:01:01 UTC <kylehakk> @KenCarman That's gonna be a great defensive match up. Can't wait.
906970592745807874 2017-09-10 20:00:14 UTC <kylehakk> If not for that punting mishap, we win. I'm not even mad. Good performance from the Browns.
906969422157504512 2017-09-10 19:55:35 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord They just have a coin flip app for these situations
906969284353589249 2017-09-10 19:55:02 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 Boooooo
906968717719994369 2017-09-10 19:52:47 UTC <kylehakk> No catch!
906968524396154882 2017-09-10 19:52:01 UTC <kylehakk> Nobody was ready for that ball. Easy for AB
906968232904548359 2017-09-10 19:50:52 UTC <kylehakk> @JohnTelich8 3 minimum.
906967300435308544 2017-09-10 19:47:09 UTC <kylehakk> @TheRealTRizzo They're scared.
906967119673348096 2017-09-10 19:46:26 UTC <kylehakk> There has to be so many fines coming from this game.
906965722072600576 2017-09-10 19:40:53 UTC <kylehakk> Haden can't keep up with anyone. Keep attacking him
906963786778779653 2017-09-10 19:33:11 UTC <kylehakk> Watching Ben Roethlisberger is sad anymore.
906962673723744256 2017-09-10 19:28:46 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood I don't get it. Tretter was supposed to be amazing but he's getting bulldozed out there.

906962026752364546 2017-09-10 19:26:12 UTC <kylehakk> @JaycrawfordCLE Riiiight
906961864659279872 2017-09-10 19:25:33 UTC <kylehakk> Once the offense starts gelling, this could be a dangerous team. The defense is going to keep us in every game, I believe.
906959457531432962 2017-09-10 19:15:59 UTC <kylehakk> Destiny has always failed to impress me with commercials and trailers. I JUST DON'T GET IT
906958995533037569 2017-09-10 19:14:09 UTC <kylehakk> That was an UGLY pass
906958745716117505 2017-09-10 19:13:10 UTC <kylehakk> You join Pittsburgh and you instantly have this urge to hurt people and make dirty plays. It's weird.
906957974240944131 2017-09-10 19:10:06 UTC <kylehakk> Josh McCown is having a nice, quiet game. Love it.
906957229261312000 2017-09-10 19:07:08 UTC <kylehakk> Helmet to helmet.
906956831272132608 2017-09-10 19:05:33 UTC <kylehakk> Please throw it away.
906948061263548419 2017-09-10 18:30:42 UTC <kylehakk> The Steelers offense scored once in the first half. Their biggest play was on a tipped pass. Myles isn't even playing. I'll take it.

876258981462908928 2017-06-17 02:03:15 UTC <kylehakk> @leahoh4 People are weird. How do they even see what they're doing?
876257795854782465 2017-06-17 01:58:33 UTC <kylehakk> @leahoh4 I always see your tweets and I'm like "wow that has to suck" and yeah, it's dumb.
876254343061794816 2017-06-17 01:44:50 UTC <kylehakk> It's almost 10 and my neighbor is mowing his lawn. Wtf.
874809660079034368 2017-06-13 02:04:10 UTC <kylehakk> @KiKi656730 Man I miss collecting those figures. Did Joey ever tell you how we'd hide them for fun? Me, him, Jesse, Jen, and Mykal. Good times.

864622854788329472 2017-05-16 23:25:27 UTC <kylehakk> @MSL Just the randomness of it is absurd. Me too, though. They're so relaxing, and easy to focus on while attempting to sleep.
864619279467020288 2017-05-16 23:11:14 UTC <kylehakk> @MSL I had a dream Kevin Sullivan was giving baptisms at the Cleveland Zoo for 40 bucks a piece. I shouldn't listen to podcasts before bed.
864258531482112000 2017-05-15 23:17:45 UTC <kylehakk> All I want to do is watch Real World Season 10 with @mikethemiz and it's literally not available anywhere. This is bullshit.
861898758606524416 2017-05-09 11:00:52 UTC <kylehakk> @KiKi656730 Hahah thanks
859600827694149633 2017-05-02 02:49:42 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood Exactly. CTF works in other games because generally everyone is even. There's so many checks and balances in Overwatch, so to speak.
859599905857425410 2017-05-02 02:46:02 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood It's funny because I won a match after I posted that. But seriously, it sucks.
859588952466042880 2017-05-02 02:02:31 UTC <kylehakk> @leahoh4 Same
859586848078823424 2017-05-02 01:54:09 UTC <kylehakk> Talk about a broken gametype.
859586814767759361 2017-05-02 01:54:01 UTC <kylehakk> I've played around 15 games of CTF on Overwatch and have never won. Still don't have the initial loot box from when the gametype launched.
859538625595396096 2017-05-02 22:42:32 UTC <kylehakk> @KiKi656730 Hahaha right. I just never took advantage of the fact that you can't really get in trouble as a minor
859537338514452480 2017-05-02 22:37:25 UTC <kylehakk> @KiKi656730 It's still one of my favorite shows. I watch it in the summer and regret not being a hooligan when I was younger.

859514857615491072 2017-05-02 21:08:05 UTC <kylehakk> Remember when they randomly killed Freddie in Skins for no fucking reason and with no build-up? I'm still mad about that to this day.

848738584551206912 2017-04-02 03:27:02 UTC <kylehakk> Jim Ross is a God damn legend. Bless that man for eternity. #WrestleMania
848738116047339520 2017-04-02 03:25:10 UTC <kylehakk> The battle of the yard. Turf wars. Neighbors fighting over a fence. So dumb. Fuck this.
848733584395554817 2017-04-02 03:07:09 UTC <kylehakk> Alexa Bliss has an unbeatable stomach. God. Damn.
848733070341656577 2017-04-02 03:05:07 UTC <kylehakk> Taker Reigns is such a bullshit main event. Fuck. I don't care.
848732705177120768 2017-04-02 03:03:40 UTC <kylehakk> The last hour of this event has sucked.
848728853023518720 2017-04-02 02:48:21 UTC <kylehakk> Good to hear excerpts of Iron Mike Tenay, Tony Schiavone and Bobby Heenan at #WrestleMania #myheroes
848727794628648963 2017-04-02 02:44:09 UTC <kylehakk> And literally nobody is happy. Crowd is dead. Suck it Randy.
848725740619169792 2017-04-02 02:35:59 UTC <kylehakk> @x_spookshowbaby They grow up so fast!
848723810329251840 2017-04-02 02:28:19 UTC <kylehakk> I don't get why the champion enters first #WrestleMania
848723568393428992 2017-04-02 02:27:21 UTC <kylehakk> @x_spookshowbaby Same. Sometimes my cats watch and it brings cat dad tears to my eye
848723066041634816 2017-04-02 02:25:22 UTC <kylehakk> @x_spookshowbaby Her whole life is wrestling and cats and that's what I want my life to be. Well, it kind of is now that I think about it.
848722781206450176 2017-04-02 02:24:14 UTC <kylehakk> @x_spookshowbaby Honestly
848722325923123204 2017-04-02 02:22:25 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery You wouldn't understand
848710438594510849 2017-04-02 01:35:11 UTC <kylehakk> Triple H is the greatest heel of all time.Honestly. #WrestleMania
848708883778600962 2017-04-02 01:29:00 UTC <kylehakk> Fuck Al Roker
848704021779099651 2017-04-02 01:09:41 UTC <kylehakk> Yep. They're getting married tonight. #WrestleMania
848699501766467585 2017-04-02 00:51:43 UTC <kylehakk> THE FUCKING HARDYZ. THE FUCKING HARDYZ
848695134728466433 2017-04-02 00:34:22 UTC <kylehakk> @MsCharlotteWWE destroys everyone. Bayley gets the final pin, and somehow they expect to tell me Charlotte isnt the best. Boo. #WrestleMania
848692847998119939 2017-04-02 00:25:17 UTC <kylehakk> This Raw Women's match is so fun #WrestleMania
848688723424403457 2017-04-02 00:08:54 UTC <kylehakk> I wish I didn't read that Fozzy was going on tour after Wrestlemania. I knew the outcome from the beginning.
848685672001142785 2017-04-02 23:56:46 UTC <kylehakk> Chris Jericho is in my top five. Years and years of entertainment.
848685380627050497 2017-04-02 23:55:37 UTC <kylehakk> https://twitter.com/NatbyNature/status/848685245683683328
848682381301227520 2017-04-02 23:43:42 UTC <kylehakk> Charlotte is so fit.
848682224677466112 2017-04-02 23:43:04 UTC <kylehakk> I've never seen a bad AJ Styles match.
848667124176474112 2017-04-02 22:43:04 UTC <kylehakk> Unless they demoted Dean to pre-show, which would be bullshit
848666916973666304 2017-04-02 22:42:15 UTC <kylehakk> "Wrestlemania starts at 7" *turns on at 6:40 to see Ambrose/Corbin* thanks, guys. #WrestleMania
848660809190395911 2017-04-02 22:17:58 UTC <kylehakk> Fucking Gronk #WrestleMania
848620533793120256 2017-04-02 19:37:56 UTC <kylehakk> I wish Undertaker's Streak was still active so Roman could end it #WrestleMania
847993146852220928 2017-03-31 02:04:55 UTC <kylehakk> @sirmitchell I was really impressed with it. I want to see it again. Everyone I know who's seen it, liked it.
847879485152251904 2017-03-31 18:33:16 UTC <kylehakk> @leahoh4 It was shitty for like two hours and then they became normal again
847772884269400064 2017-03-31 11:29:41 UTC <kylehakk> My dryer didn't fully dry my jeans so I'm wearing them wet, I guess.
847619233009684481 2017-03-30 01:19:07 UTC <kylehakk> @Scott_Ian I actually thought it was Among the Living until a closer inspection.
847576442531713028 2017-03-30 22:29:05 UTC <kylehakk> At this point, why do I even shave my balls anymore?
847556448926171136 2017-03-30 21:09:38 UTC <kylehakk> Asa Akira got me through some hard times. *rimshot*
847191701680738305 2017-03-29 21:00:16 UTC <kylehakk> I'll probably orgasm if I work this Q-Tip any better.
846761451863883776 2017-03-28 16:30:36 UTC <kylehakk> It's never been done with these powerful consoles. Imagine a D-day invasion with more than just 10 people on the beach? It'd be amazing.
846761185248759810 2017-03-28 16:29:33 UTC <kylehakk> Seeing people not excited for Call of Duty WWII makes me sad. People saying it's not CoD without wall running and fast action. #killme
846142642882793474 2017-03-26 23:31:41 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood i follow them all on Instagram. Just power rangers promos forever. Living the dream.
846140734021480448 2017-03-26 23:24:06 UTC <kylehakk> Man it would have been so cool to be one of the original Power Rangers. They're famous forever.
845753172991901697 2017-03-25 21:44:04 UTC <kylehakk> In honor of the next COD being set in WW2, I'm gonna show my girlfriend the magic that is Saving Private Ryan.
845473497774247940 2017-03-24 03:12:44 UTC <kylehakk> BTW, go Gators!
845473007640436736 2017-03-24 03:10:47 UTC <kylehakk> I just wanna say I have Devin Booker on my bench tonight because I stopped giving a fuck about basketball three weeks into the season.
845418956332650496 2017-03-24 23:36:00 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery me too and I don't even like that music. I just want drugs.
845276851119509506 2017-03-24 14:11:20 UTC <kylehakk> Hilary Duff is a goddesspic.twitter.com/7py4e4ax4g
845074001647063040 2017-03-23 00:45:17 UTC <kylehakk> Thank you @RealKevinNash for recommending @Detroiters . Episode 1 was great. Time to binge watch and catch up.

844750726882639872 2017-03-22 03:20:42 UTC <kylehakk> @ochocinco chicken breast, chicken breast, 3 eggs, pecan waffle.
844292724408930310 2017-03-21 21:00:46 UTC <kylehakk> Is there anywhere scarier to work than a mannequin factory? You're creating fake humans. Stop.
844285643081601025 2017-03-21 20:32:38 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord mostly about how people just want handouts and don't want to work and they deserve a shit life.
844285482007695360 2017-03-21 20:31:59 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord tried harder in life. And he shouldn't have to pay for her mistakes and then I was ready to brawl
844285377754157056 2017-03-21 20:31:34 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord Trump will save America by giving jobs to Americans. Our waitress was a single mom of two and he said she should have
844280763055071234 2017-03-21 20:13:14 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord piece of shit logic. It was like a half hour conversation and then I couldn't take it anymore.
844279149007134720 2017-03-21 20:06:49 UTC <kylehakk> I almost fought some guy at El Puente because he wanted Mexicans deported despite the fact he was eating their food. Fucking scum.
844267284164202496 2017-03-21 19:19:40 UTC <kylehakk> Aaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
844245012909113345 2017-03-21 17:51:11 UTC <kylehakk> It's 1:50 and I'm almost drunk #thankswork
843950140490731524 2017-03-20 22:19:27 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery what? It's nice out.
843846504339202048 2017-03-20 15:27:39 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord same. I saw all the bad animations but then majority of people haven't experienced any of them.
843846171793768449 2017-03-20 15:26:19 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord good. I just read the story is shitty and the squad isn't as good as the old squad. Basically good gameplay/bad writing.
843826320610082818 2017-03-20 14:07:27 UTC <kylehakk> Reviews all over the place for Mass Effect :(
843495836273262592 2017-03-19 16:14:13 UTC <kylehakk> Jake Gyllenhaal is so attractive.
843238247757238273 2017-03-18 23:10:39 UTC <kylehakk> Sending death threats to the lead animator of Bioware? "Gamers" are fucking awful.
842898641954246660 2017-03-17 00:41:11 UTC <kylehakk> And yes, by fully enjoy, I mean smack my dick around.
842898038838476800 2017-03-17 00:38:47 UTC <kylehakk> You know I'm getting old when I can't fully enjoy these leaks because I feel terrible for the people involved.
842847149020798976 2017-03-17 21:16:34 UTC <kylehakk> I've seen Seth Rollins dick, too.
841759975810727940 2017-03-14 21:16:32 UTC <kylehakk> It would be so funny to take away Pryor's QBhttps://twitter.com/ProFootballTalk/status/841746824100773888
841727897513689088 2017-03-14 19:09:03 UTC <kylehakk> @WWESuperCard WM33 is the name of the tier? Why not Royal or something? You have Survivor, WM, and SS. Royal seems like a better choice.

841721435404013572 2017-03-14 18:43:23 UTC <kylehakk> I just want to go to Miami.
841704721672986624 2017-03-14 17:36:58 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord it's crazy that they could have had the same career path but Lacy sabotaged himself.
841702504073187330 2017-03-14 17:28:09 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord seriously though. 267 is huge. Damn.
841702100224614400 2017-03-14 17:26:33 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord signed him for the offensive line.
841428953260838917 2017-03-13 23:21:10 UTC <kylehakk> Must be pajama day at Walmart.
841421376024125440 2017-03-13 22:51:03 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery on my way
840975398288687104 2017-03-12 17:18:54 UTC <kylehakk> I never get tired of Powerslave.
840364310610268160 2017-03-10 00:50:39 UTC <kylehakk> And that's another ring for Bill and the Boys.https://twitter.com/wingoz/status/840363190018019328
840363532491317248 2017-03-10 00:47:34 UTC <kylehakk> It bothers me that my tweets are all out of order. I can't enjoy twitter anymore.
840328720581873664 2017-03-10 22:29:14 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord I agree and disagree. I like that they aren't being bullied by the agents. It sets a good precedent for the league.
840328292062355456 2017-03-10 22:27:32 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord or less. You never know. Colt McCoy could be chucking it to him.
840325649952845824 2017-03-10 22:17:02 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord right. And his odds are higher with Cousins throwing to him. It's just weird to me that 32 million isn't enough to people.
840319759149338626 2017-03-10 21:53:37 UTC <kylehakk> Cleveland offered Pryor the same deal. It's on him, not Cleveland. So much for his "loyalty" that he went on and on about.
839982329162563584 2017-03-09 23:32:48 UTC <kylehakk> IS JOSH GORDON FUCKING REINSTATED?!  https://twitter.com/JOSH_GORDONXII/status/839968042197090305

839958631592431617 2017-03-09 21:58:38 UTC <kylehakk> @mikethemiz it's all part of a master plan. Acquiring picks to trade for Jimmy G.
839956401048915972 2017-03-09 21:49:46 UTC <kylehakk> Browns are getting Jimmy G, I swear on it. Acquiring all these picks for trade bait.
839955960315650048 2017-03-09 21:48:01 UTC <kylehakk> God the Browns are genius level with these moves. This is the most amazing day.

838602010198945792 2017-03-05 04:07:54 UTC <kylehakk> Renee Young is my dream girl sometimes.
838601929039183872 2017-03-05 04:07:35 UTC <kylehakk> @adamrank Smackdown shows are leaps and bounds ahead of Raw's. I'm not mad with the result though.
838599905484673024 2017-03-05 03:59:32 UTC <kylehakk> Also Kevin Owens' beard looks like my ass hair. I need to trim it up.
838599804343169024 2017-03-05 03:59:08 UTC <kylehakk> Goooooldberg Goooooldberg! Let's go! #WWEFastlane
837864231911452674 2017-03-03 03:16:14 UTC <kylehakk> @Bucks @MsCharlotteWWE THAT BUCK IS BROKEN IN HALF
837850652789338112 2017-03-03 02:22:16 UTC <kylehakk> I fucking hate Andy and April.
837836742115872769 2017-03-03 01:27:00 UTC <kylehakk> @RicFlairNatrBoy it'd be easier to ask who wouldn't want to go. WOO
837484946612682756 2017-03-02 02:09:05 UTC <kylehakk> The fact that I can feel myself getting stronger is so rewarding.
837453403726958593 2017-03-02 00:03:45 UTC <kylehakk> I'm late watching Smackdown but Randy Orton lit a fucking barn on fire.
836705315181768704 2017-02-28 22:31:07 UTC <kylehakk> @shaymitch Wendy's
836068617779306496 2017-02-26 04:21:06 UTC <kylehakk> The lapdance is always better when the stripper is crying.
836031585023639555 2017-02-26 01:53:57 UTC <kylehakk> "I'm going to do laundry" *folds one shirt and proceeds to watch tv for an hour*
835919892947812352 2017-02-26 18:30:07 UTC <kylehakk> My girlfriend doesn't like crispy bacon and that's going to cause problems for us down the road
835707944595501057 2017-02-25 04:27:55 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon until just now. But seriously, a five minute, in depth, food sex scene was the last thing I needed to see.
835705047682019329 2017-02-25 04:16:24 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon I'm just going to pretend I didn't watch it.
835668828998750208 2017-02-25 01:52:29 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery phew. Close call

835658491943600128 2017-02-25 01:11:24 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery I love Seth Rogen stuff but this is soooooooo bad
835655002228142080 2017-02-25 00:57:32 UTC <kylehakk> Does Sausage Party ever get better? I'm like twenty minutes in and this is arguably one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
835510481867657216 2017-02-25 15:23:16 UTC <kylehakk> @Bourdain still the best game in the series. 80s soundtrack, fast cars, coke dealing, and pixelated tits in bikinis.
835290106009432065 2017-02-24 00:47:34 UTC <kylehakk> I could listen to Kevin Sullivan talk all say. He's just so knowledgeable and easy to listen to.
834455845211688962 2017-02-22 17:32:31 UTC <kylehakk> @DanaBrookeWWE you can buy them at World Market in Mayfield Heights. I get them all the time.

832575282775220224 2017-02-17 12:59:50 UTC <kylehakk> Could you possibly slurp your coffee any fucking louder? Fuck.

809597215069048832 2016-12-15 03:13:12 UTC <kylehakk> There's so many friendships I had where I was the only one to ever initiate contact. I've cut them from my life and it's 100% better.

796205623343976448 2016-11-08 04:19:48 UTC <kylehakk> I was just saying how it's going to be a Republican led America. He has a free pass to do whatever he wants. Insanity.
796204401308401665 2016-11-08 04:14:56 UTC <kylehakk> Google has Donald Trump for Washington, but Hillary with the higher % of votes. Get your shit together Google.

796203288291135492 2016-11-08 04:10:31 UTC <kylehakk> Alaska probably goes Republican right? Because I think only Sarah Palin lives there.
796201872872837124 2016-11-08 04:04:53 UTC <kylehakk> If he loses, we'll have to hear how Trump won the popular vote for 4 years/rigged. As if Gore didn't find himself in the same predicament.

796192859330383872 2016-11-08 03:29:04 UTC <kylehakk> @MichaelRapaport Cleveland voted Blue. And Cincinnati and Columbus. But the rest is just inbred rural villages.

794034253889728512 2016-11-02 04:31:33 UTC <kylehakk> Captain strikeout
794034030945574912 2016-11-02 04:30:40 UTC <kylehakk> @Theorossi if they were playing any team but Cleveland, sure.
794033181200646145 2016-11-02 04:27:17 UTC <kylehakk> The Rain Delay. The next Cleveland "thing"
794032503577309184 2016-11-02 04:24:35 UTC <kylehakk> It's done
794031778046603264 2016-11-02 04:21:42 UTC <kylehakk> Fucking told you. Most consistent bat in the series so far. Ugh.
794031221898612736 2016-11-02 04:19:30 UTC <kylehakk> Zobrist is too consistent. I don't like this.
794030474633089024 2016-11-02 04:16:32 UTC <kylehakk> Bryan Shaw looks like a generic create a player in a video game. I love it.
794030229346025472 2016-11-02 04:15:33 UTC <kylehakk> Please get Bryant out.
794029942937911296 2016-11-02 04:14:25 UTC <kylehakk> Ah man. I was gonna say Schwarber is an easy throw out from anywhere in the stadium but he gone.
794029617996828672 2016-11-02 04:13:07 UTC <kylehakk> Also, the heart of the cubs lineup. Yikes.
794029558303485953 2016-11-02 04:12:53 UTC <kylehakk> I never like a pitcher coming back after a delay. Never truly warm up.
794024917901733888 2016-11-02 03:54:27 UTC <kylehakk> Now I'm afraid of dyinghttps://twitter.com/RaysFanGio/status/529685338894372864
794023092448325632 2016-11-02 03:47:12 UTC <kylehakk> There has to be a blast
794022892308692992 2016-11-02 03:46:24 UTC <kylehakk> First pitch Homer. Calling it
794022280791724036 2016-11-02 03:43:58 UTC <kylehakk> This is where the magic happens
794017337754210304 2016-11-02 03:24:20 UTC <kylehakk> Fuck. Rain.
794016918957162496 2016-11-02 03:22:40 UTC <kylehakk> This is for The Shot
794016235658809344 2016-11-02 03:19:57 UTC <kylehakk> @mindykaling bear pun. Nice.
794016093174136833 2016-11-02 03:19:23 UTC <kylehakk> If he dies, he dies.

794015242166669312 2016-11-02 03:16:00 UTC <kylehakk> Naming my son Rajai. Rajai Hakkarainen
794015180812337153 2016-11-02 03:15:45 UTC <kylehakk> My heart is racing
794015134045863936 2016-11-02 03:15:34 UTC <kylehakk> Coworker said that Chapman would get rocked tonight. Basically in the same shoes as Kluber. Relievers can't pitch that much.
794005045436149760 2016-11-02 02:35:29 UTC <kylehakk> It's like every celebrity in the world came out as a Cubs fan just this season. So annoying.
793996256557355009 2016-11-02 02:00:33 UTC <kylehakk> I'm cursed. The second. Literally the second I turn the channel, the Indians score 2.
793991994855059456 2016-11-02 01:43:37 UTC <kylehakk> It's also fucking  sad that this is basically a home game for Chicago. Cleveland fucking sucks.
793990135616520192 2016-11-02 01:36:14 UTC <kylehakk> Out
793989742396375040 2016-11-02 01:34:40 UTC <kylehakk> Okay, so Chicago's bats are done for the night with Miller in. It's a shame our bats have been done for 2 games.
793989231312011266 2016-11-02 01:32:39 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood right. I haven't watched baseball in forever. It sucks. I'm mad, but I'll forget about it in an hour or two.
793989064223584256 2016-11-02 01:31:59 UTC <kylehakk> Captain fucking strikeout gets a home run. Why wasn't Kluber pulled to start the inning?
793988838926536705 2016-11-02 01:31:05 UTC <kylehakk> Just kidding, I have to watch American Horror Story.
793988742130372609 2016-11-02 01:30:42 UTC <kylehakk> Aaaaaaaaaand goodnight
793988135969554433 2016-11-02 01:28:17 UTC <kylehakk> The day the Cavs won the Championship, I woke up knowing they'd win. Today I woke up with a sense of dread.
793987416705142784 2016-11-02 01:25:26 UTC <kylehakk> Or just make it the quickest half inning  ever. GOOD GOD
793986576468602880 2016-11-02 01:22:06 UTC <kylehakk> Please just tie it up this inning. Please.
793985176061837312 2016-11-02 01:16:32 UTC <kylehakk> The thing that sucks is that baseball is such a long season. You come this far to lose. Fuck.
793984165632942080 2016-11-02 01:12:31 UTC <kylehakk> Fuck this I'm out.
793983962045673472 2016-11-02 01:11:42 UTC <kylehakk> Addison Russell looks like a drag queen
793983817463762944 2016-11-02 01:11:08 UTC <kylehakk> Easy fucking double play. Ugh.
793983293389733888 2016-11-02 01:09:03 UTC <kylehakk> I'm about to shut this off.
793625519237521408 2016-11-01 01:27:23 UTC <kylehakk> Hendricks is a shitty pitcher. Indians win in 7.
793573735580233728 2016-11-01 22:01:37 UTC <kylehakk> @unicornmaiden1 I was contemplating keeping everything up. Halloween ends too soon.

792933007854342144 2016-10-30 03:35:35 UTC <kylehakk> I'm glad my stream is behind the actual game so now I know we get out of this.
792932524162973697 2016-10-30 03:33:40 UTC <kylehakk> Baez also swung when Gomes threw it back to the mound #WorldSeries #RallyTogether
792931562262241280 2016-10-30 03:29:51 UTC <kylehakk> This is where Maddon fucks up by having  Chapman hit. He can't pitch the 9th effectively
792930776258113540 2016-10-30 03:26:43 UTC <kylehakk> Napoli, Santana, Ramirez. Triple threat.

792923820466339840 2016-10-30 02:59:05 UTC <kylehakk> Kris Bryant has such a punchable face
792921436314865664 2016-10-30 02:49:36 UTC <kylehakk> David Ross spoke in claaaasss toddaayyyyyyayyy
792921049881014272 2016-10-30 02:48:04 UTC <kylehakk> @BMcCarthy32 sarcasm?
792920701065891840 2016-10-30 02:46:41 UTC <kylehakk> Only time I've ever hated Eddie Vedder
792917137157394432 2016-10-30 02:32:31 UTC <kylehakk> I think I lost in all five of my fantasy leagues this week. I've never done that before. Bad day.
792913447851786240 2016-10-30 02:17:52 UTC <kylehakk> Fuck
792913285024743424 2016-10-30 02:17:13 UTC <kylehakk> Party at Napoli's?
792909183033176064 2016-10-30 02:00:55 UTC <kylehakk> Someone @ me if the Tribe comes back. I need to get a good night's sleep for once.
792908724876746752 2016-10-30 01:59:06 UTC <kylehakk> These fans go batshit over routine fly balls. It's almost as if they're rich, entitled folk who've never actually watched baseball before.
792906959330607104 2016-10-30 01:52:05 UTC <kylehakk> Trying to bait Buck into talking about Schwarber
792906422916943873 2016-10-30 01:49:57 UTC <kylehakk> Great at bat for Guyer

792903696183156736 2016-10-30 01:39:07 UTC <kylehakk> That Skip Bayless show looks terrible. Him just saying off the wall things to get viewers. God, that guy is a hack.
792903523323224065 2016-10-30 01:38:26 UTC <kylehakk> 2 runs isn't that bad. Let's fucking go, Tribe!
792901927793197061 2016-10-30 01:32:05 UTC <kylehakk> I pray to the double play Gods now
792901373054619648 2016-10-30 01:29:53 UTC <kylehakk> Good God I'm going to have a heart attack
792901098537377792 2016-10-30 01:28:47 UTC <kylehakk> I loved hearing those Cubs fan cry.
792859740925722625 2016-10-30 22:44:27 UTC <kylehakk> The Gotham cast is probably the most attractive cast on TV.

792831429256290308 2016-10-30 20:51:57 UTC <kylehakk> Good thing we cut Taylor Gabriel....
792822715916886016 2016-10-30 20:17:20 UTC <kylehakk> I need some retail therapy
792822640306159616 2016-10-30 20:17:02 UTC <kylehakk> 20 yard onside kick
792822239708254210 2016-10-30 20:15:26 UTC <kylehakk> Too bad everyone took their time subbing out and lining up after every play. Where's the urgency they had against Tennessee?
792820413663412224 2016-10-30 20:08:11 UTC <kylehakk> Pryor does this every week, too. Dynamite first half, schlub second half.
792820244209426432 2016-10-30 20:07:30 UTC <kylehakk> Duke Johnson seems frustrated and angry and depressed, and I just want to tell him it'll be alright in 2-3 years.
792819250922713088 2016-10-30 20:03:33 UTC <kylehakk> Three and out, right?
792818324774281222 2016-10-30 19:59:53 UTC <kylehakk> Pick six. Get ready
792818002383233024 2016-10-30 19:58:36 UTC <kylehakk> Game winning defensive drive for the Jets, I meant.
792817719766900740 2016-10-30 19:57:28 UTC <kylehakk> Remember when Gary Barnidge was good?
792817324512477184 2016-10-30 19:55:54 UTC <kylehakk> He dropped that, I think
792816820101255168 2016-10-30 19:53:54 UTC <kylehakk> I don't even want to watch the Cowboys game next week.
792816538185265152 2016-10-30 19:52:47 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood only in Cleveland
792816340482613248 2016-10-30 19:52:00 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood game tying. Blow me!
792816197167439872 2016-10-30 19:51:25 UTC <kylehakk> And it's gonna be a 99 yard drive
792816110114660352 2016-10-30 19:51:05 UTC <kylehakk> Game winning drive coming up. Take it easy. Pace it and drive it in.
792815157269368832 2016-10-30 19:47:17 UTC <kylehakk> Joe Haden is so handsy and never gets called for it.
792814727923634176 2016-10-30 19:45:35 UTC <kylehakk> When's the last time we ran the ball? It's just all deep balls to Pryor. Instant panic mode. Game over.
792814264151146497 2016-10-30 19:43:45 UTC <kylehakk> Why the fuck do they get so desperate the second they start losing? There's still time! God damn.
792810420239233024 2016-10-30 19:28:28 UTC <kylehakk> Just waiting for a Fitzpatrick mistake. It'll win it for us.
792803369756811273 2016-10-30 19:00:27 UTC <kylehakk> We always look so poor in the third quarter. What happens in the locker room every week?
792802590576766980 2016-10-30 18:57:21 UTC <kylehakk> That was the worst tackling I've seen since... Last week.
792799879940767744 2016-10-30 18:46:35 UTC <kylehakk> Now it's just an angry dad saying "it's third down!"
792799831500685312 2016-10-30 18:46:23 UTC <kylehakk> I miss the Halloween theme on 3rd downs.
792799537358315520 2016-10-30 18:45:13 UTC <kylehakk> Bill Cowher is a solid dude for that shout out to the 86 Browns and Schottenheimer.
792767241783836672 2016-10-30 16:36:54 UTC <kylehakk> Browns win today.
792747414759366656 2016-10-30 15:18:06 UTC <kylehakk> I don't know how people can honestly still play Skyrim.
792410366038999040 2016-10-29 16:58:48 UTC <kylehakk> Having trick-or-treat not on Halloween night kinda kills the holiday for me. Halloween basically ends after trick-or-treating.
791844759606267904 2016-10-27 03:31:17 UTC <kylehakk> I think I'm going to buy NHL network. I'm tired of not watching hockey.
791833356468191232 2016-10-27 02:45:58 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood i can't believe it. They have so much talent on that team, but they're still so bad.
791763523265241088 2016-10-27 22:08:28 UTC <kylehakk> There's always spiders making eggs and nests, but you never see spiders fucking. Why is that?

791107099002626048 2016-10-25 02:40:05 UTC <kylehakk> @TheRealXPac nah.
791106598676692993 2016-10-25 02:38:05 UTC <kylehakk> My heart is racing. Fuck.
791081775489490944 2016-10-25 00:59:27 UTC <kylehakk> Lester dialed in now. Game will end 2-0 at this rate.
791076509100433408 2016-10-25 00:38:31 UTC <kylehakk> Kluber just going for the throat right away. That's how you pitch! #WorldSeries #RallyTogether
791075557001850880 2016-10-25 00:34:44 UTC <kylehakk> Fuck. I hate leaving RISP.
791075059062431744 2016-10-25 00:32:46 UTC <kylehakk> Lester can't do anything right now and it's amazing #WorldSeries #RallyTogether

790376009841377280 2016-10-23 02:14:59 UTC <kylehakk> I wish everyone on The Walking Dead would die.
790278347750248449 2016-10-23 19:46:55 UTC <kylehakk> At least let Hogan break Manziels rushing record so that he's out of the NFL forever.
790277643631493124 2016-10-23 19:44:07 UTC <kylehakk> I regret not starting Ajayi. I assumed it was a fluke game.
790275879121321986 2016-10-23 19:37:06 UTC <kylehakk> I can't wait for Corey Coleman to be back.
790273735223812097 2016-10-23 19:28:35 UTC <kylehakk> Mike Nugent sucks
790272580762628096 2016-10-23 19:24:00 UTC <kylehakk> I'm kind of over Joe Haden at this point.
790271566470901760 2016-10-23 19:19:58 UTC <kylehakk> Fuck Jeremy Hill.
790269722851995648 2016-10-23 19:12:39 UTC <kylehakk> Total makeup call

790266729352007680 2016-10-23 19:00:45 UTC <kylehakk> AJ Green is saving my team
790264135812542464 2016-10-23 18:50:27 UTC <kylehakk> Pancreatic Cancer is almost always fatal but the NFL doesn't give a shit about it because they can't use it to cater to women.

790246168768946177 2016-10-23 17:39:03 UTC <kylehakk> Hello Alvin Bailey, goodbye running game.
790245909183561732 2016-10-23 17:38:01 UTC <kylehakk> That Browns o-line is cursed.
790019079214170112 2016-10-22 02:36:40 UTC <kylehakk> Sophia Bush has a sexy voice
789844525481136129 2016-10-22 15:03:04 UTC <kylehakk> I miss socializing on Xbox. Nobody talks anymore and it's only half as fun.
789142152429305858 2016-10-20 16:32:05 UTC <kylehakk> @leeharveyosmond thank you, a thousand times over. Safe travels, my friend.
788948891743973376 2016-10-19 03:44:08 UTC <kylehakk> @leeharveyosmond I forgot to ask, but what cologne do you wear?
788535300129714176 2016-10-18 00:20:40 UTC <kylehakk> I can't find this sticker anywhere and I really need it.https://twitter.com/livsingh95/status/788531897223745540
788531787328782336 2016-10-18 00:06:42 UTC <kylehakk> @GothamTVWriters  are screwing me around with this Penguin/Riddler romance. I can't take it anymore! @mister_CMS @robinlordtaylor #Gotham

787646474184196096 2016-10-16 13:28:47 UTC <kylehakk> It's coming!https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/787639249864630273
787452156622282752 2016-10-15 00:36:38 UTC <kylehakk> I need a cool online persona. SpaceBoy69.
787452066167943168 2016-10-15 00:36:17 UTC <kylehakk> I'm just going to watch 90210 and eat Lemonheads.
787451554383142912 2016-10-15 00:34:15 UTC <kylehakk> I'm content doing nothing, but hate doing nothing at the same time.
787451462070706176 2016-10-15 00:33:53 UTC <kylehakk> I've been in a funk lately and I don't like it. I want to do things, but don't. I'm not depressed, life's great. I've just stopped caring?
787451238778544128 2016-10-15 00:33:00 UTC <kylehakk> That new @iamjojo album is dope.
787065452707151872 2016-10-14 23:00:01 UTC <kylehakk> I wish I had horseradish instead of blood.

786761396151353344 2016-10-13 02:51:48 UTC <kylehakk> Well that was a waste of time.
786759858481721344 2016-10-13 02:45:42 UTC <kylehakk> I want to watch one more Chargers drive but I need to sleep.
786742003065298944 2016-10-13 01:34:45 UTC <kylehakk> @joethomas73 helmets are sweet though. And the Chargers look awesome.
786673237212139521 2016-10-13 21:01:30 UTC <kylehakk> @hkasulka

785995492316569601 2016-10-11 00:08:23 UTC <kylehakk> @hkasulka all praise to you. You're killing it. I can't get enough #TheExorcist
785978793865404416 2016-10-11 23:02:01 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery my life has changed for the better
785978715738112000 2016-10-11 23:01:43 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery it's so bad. I got a pulled pork sandwich, and it was like mashed potatoes because the pork was so overcooked. Blech
785978584624168960 2016-10-11 23:01:12 UTC <kylehakk> Some kid just knocked on my door and then when I answered it, he was in my side yard, peeing on my fence. What the fuck, Ashtabula?
785977822577819648 2016-10-11 22:58:10 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery chops is the fucking worst restaurant I've ever been to.
785969970106818561 2016-10-11 22:26:58 UTC <kylehakk> That iconic duo/trio meme is the most unfunny piece of shit.
785967663424167936 2016-10-11 22:17:48 UTC <kylehakk> Weekly "Barbara is so hot #Gotham " tweet
785966343338221568 2016-10-11 22:12:33 UTC <kylehakk> Commando in sweatpants is life.
785727920719396864 2016-10-10 06:25:09 UTC <kylehakk> Woke up and couldn't sleep. Figured I'd check to see if the Cubs won... It's still going. Jesus.
785679909503000576 2016-10-10 03:14:22 UTC <kylehakk> @LarryTheSusLord I lost to someone playing Cody Kessler as their QB. Feels bad man.
785679115450015744 2016-10-10 03:11:12 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 it's like the Simpsons. I don't care how bad it gets, it has to be on forever.
785674921217232896 2016-10-10 02:54:33 UTC <kylehakk> @WORLDSTAR @JordanWallace_9 http://www.snopes.com/spongebob-squarepants-cancelled/
785597664914137088 2016-10-10 21:47:33 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery drugs?!
785289345251078145 2016-10-09 01:22:24 UTC <kylehakk> Brandon and Brenda have the weirdest sibling relationship. Too much touching. #90210
785288248369221632 2016-10-09 01:18:03 UTC <kylehakk> I want to go to a rich people party.
785270593352499200 2016-10-09 00:07:53 UTC <kylehakk> Are Brenda and Dylan gonna fuck? #90210
785209600727457792 2016-10-09 20:05:31 UTC <kylehakk> And the Eagles are going to lose, too. Overall, a shitty day
785208848311353344 2016-10-09 20:02:32 UTC <kylehakk> How is that not pass interference? Jesus fucking Christ
785208050848268288 2016-10-09 19:59:22 UTC <kylehakk> Honestly let's just kneel and punt. End this game. We have to go pick up Jimmy Clausen this week now.
785207727220023296 2016-10-09 19:58:05 UTC <kylehakk> This is unreal.
785205221370826752 2016-10-09 19:48:07 UTC <kylehakk> Austin Pasztor just took a hell of a stiff arm from Whitehurst.
785201368952872960 2016-10-09 19:32:49 UTC <kylehakk> I wish the Eagles game was on
785200859558936576 2016-10-09 19:30:47 UTC <kylehakk> Also Connor Hamlett is like 6'7".  He needs to be out there more.
785200770408910848 2016-10-09 19:30:26 UTC <kylehakk> I'm just going to cruise H&M for the rest of the day. I'll blow half my next paycheck on clothes.
785199337978597376 2016-10-09 19:24:45 UTC <kylehakk> This is a different game if Kessler doesn't get hurt. Not saying they'd win, but it would be at least respectable.
785197909549649920 2016-10-09 19:19:04 UTC <kylehakk> Chris Hogan is going to die out there.
785197864284786689 2016-10-09 19:18:53 UTC <kylehakk> At least the Indians are gonna kick the shit out the Red Sox tomorrow.
785180869497585664 2016-10-09 18:11:21 UTC <kylehakk> This is amazing.https://twitter.com/JasonLaCanfora/status/785178272346898432
785177350526922752 2016-10-09 17:57:22 UTC <kylehakk> Looks like we found our QB!
785171964579221504 2016-10-09 17:35:58 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood it looked like a 50/50 split.
785171531672481792 2016-10-09 17:34:15 UTC <kylehakk> Worst spike in the world @MartysaurusRex
785169416090685444 2016-10-09 17:25:51 UTC <kylehakk> Remember when everyone was pissed when Cleveland drafted Kessler? Go fuck yourselves.
784751295072768000 2016-10-08 13:44:23 UTC <kylehakk> @IngrahamAngle you write like an insane person would.

784228768025944065 2016-10-06 03:08:03 UTC <kylehakk> I always just want to tell this one bitch off. Like, you're so fucking dumb. But I have limited friends so I say nothing.

783508889492914176 2016-10-04 03:27:30 UTC <kylehakk> @wersmafone things are good. A little weirder after that power Rangers video lol. How about you?

782732506277838848 2016-10-02 00:02:26 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood another close loss for you. Damn.
782689895471017986 2016-10-02 21:13:07 UTC <kylehakk> This is a leader. Standing up against the refs, whereas Goodell held a gun to Duke's head and told him to say he fumbled it.https://twitter.com/MaryKayCabot/status/782688850523086848
782689523344011266 2016-10-02 21:11:38 UTC <kylehakk> @CodyKessler6 @Browns can someone tell Cody I love him?
782678787351842817 2016-10-02 20:28:59 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood it doesn't happen.
782676376520388608 2016-10-02 20:19:24 UTC <kylehakk> Here we go 68 yard field goal
782675406667251712 2016-10-02 20:15:33 UTC <kylehakk> My dad just called that Derek Anderson pick. "Here he goes, to end the game" and bam! Picked off without a Panther in sight.
782674094877704192 2016-10-02 20:10:20 UTC <kylehakk> Derek Anderson is better than Cam Newton. Who knew?
782673515124232193 2016-10-02 20:08:02 UTC <kylehakk> Didn't know Washington had the number 5 offense in the league. I guess that'd pretty good
782672610178043905 2016-10-02 20:04:26 UTC <kylehakk> @NatbyNature nice smile!
782672262759583744 2016-10-02 20:03:03 UTC <kylehakk> Every time they can, they show Josh Norman. Holy fuck. We get it.
782672123760353280 2016-10-02 20:02:30 UTC <kylehakk> @jaycrawfordespn bring back the replacement refs. Same results, but much cheaper for the league.
782671965584781312 2016-10-02 20:01:52 UTC <kylehakk> Can't make this shit up. Rigged.https://twitter.com/jaycrawfordespn/status/782670067913875461
782669622843674624 2016-10-02 19:52:34 UTC <kylehakk> We get a random ass center and he does a really good job, and now he's hurt. Of course.
782667312025468929 2016-10-02 19:43:23 UTC <kylehakk> If Haden can't touch Jackson for a second, but Norman can yank Pryor's jersey... Do we really know what pass interference is?
782666955157307392 2016-10-02 19:41:58 UTC <kylehakk> You're not allowed to make any shooting celebrations or kneeling. I read that the other day.
782664838602514441 2016-10-02 19:33:33 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood it makes you feel like you could be an NFL coach.
782664679936196609 2016-10-02 19:32:55 UTC <kylehakk> Only give the ball to Crowell for the remainder of the game.
782663944800468992 2016-10-02 19:30:00 UTC <kylehakk> Pryor won the first half, but I'm saying Norman is winning the second half. Good match up.
782663713748840448 2016-10-02 19:29:05 UTC <kylehakk> It's hard when you have 4 stud RB's and have to bench one. I'm glad I picked correctly with Lamar Miller.
782662560885637121 2016-10-02 19:24:30 UTC <kylehakk> And then that random "commercial break" two minute timeout in the middle of our last drive, when Washington's D is sucking air.
782662096102289409 2016-10-02 19:22:39 UTC <kylehakk> Jeff Triplett can suck my ass pubes
782661907316666368 2016-10-02 19:21:54 UTC <kylehakk> And when I say bad, I'm talking historically bad.
782661842091044864 2016-10-02 19:21:38 UTC <kylehakk> It's really really really really hard to say this shit isn't rigged. Setting up for 3rd and 26. We can basically win it and then bad PI call
782661555255148545 2016-10-02 19:20:30 UTC <kylehakk> Uncatchable doesn't exist anymore.
782659365534830592 2016-10-02 19:11:48 UTC <kylehakk> Hell of a drive just ruined.
782659331036684289 2016-10-02 19:11:40 UTC <kylehakk> Who runs fullbacks anymore? Dammit.
782649935103746048 2016-10-02 18:34:20 UTC <kylehakk> @ochocinco shell tops. Love it.
782649652046860288 2016-10-02 18:33:12 UTC <kylehakk> Man, Lady Gaga makes my pants feel funny.
782641397430116352 2016-10-02 18:00:24 UTC <kylehakk> I'm getting a Pryor jersey. Fuck it. He's the man.

780218955273277442 2016-09-25 01:34:29 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood I want the Saints to crush them. I had really high hopes for them this year. No defense and all offense is exciting.
780217791949508608 2016-09-25 01:29:52 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood I honestly don't think I will. Fleener will give me between 1-5 and they'll double team Cooks or something.

780141256211136512 2016-09-25 20:25:44 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood yeah he's talking to Tannehill on the sidelines
780141027701252096 2016-09-25 20:24:49 UTC <kylehakk> I can't believe Matt Moore is still a QB
780140930858909696 2016-09-25 20:24:26 UTC <kylehakk> Yes! Ryan Tannehill is such a crybaby.
780140776227479552 2016-09-25 20:23:50 UTC <kylehakk> It's thirrrrrrrrddd down
780140655788064768 2016-09-25 20:23:21 UTC <kylehakk> Hue puts his faith in the defense, and then they look completely different than the defense from ten minutes agi
780140159379660800 2016-09-25 20:21:22 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood yeah, I know. He was lights out in Philly, got hurt and then just couldn't kick anymore. Was hoping it was a fluke.
780139855166726144 2016-09-25 20:20:10 UTC <kylehakk> I was really pulling for Parkey but he's lost it.

780132922867216384 2016-09-25 19:52:37 UTC <kylehakk> Why didn't he cut left?! Oh my God the field was wide open. Great run regardless
780132620147523584 2016-09-25 19:51:25 UTC <kylehakk> How do you call a holding call three minutes after a play ran?
780132546080301056 2016-09-25 19:51:07 UTC <kylehakk> I told my dad there would be some bullshit holding call, and there it is.
780132126272393217 2016-09-25 19:49:27 UTC <kylehakk> It's bullshit that the players even have to bring it up to the officials. They should just fucking know

780128095588212736 2016-09-25 19:33:26 UTC <kylehakk> The line is 12 and we're down by eleven. Shits rigged as fuck.

780126734503010304 2016-09-25 19:28:02 UTC <kylehakk> 31st against the rush and we haven't had a run play in the longest time. Same as last week. We go down and become a pass only team.

780115462650757121 2016-09-25 18:43:14 UTC <kylehakk> Miami has the worst fans of any city. Brand new stadium, mediocre but not terrible team, and that stadium is basically empty.

777599511984279553 2016-09-18 20:05:45 UTC <kylehakk> Then Cam Erving blows our last timeout. He's something alright.

777584047656697857 2016-09-18 19:04:18 UTC <kylehakk> The ball is allowed to hit the ground as long as the receiver maintains control?! What the fuck? Since when? Fuck the NFL.
777583528561238017 2016-09-18 19:02:14 UTC <kylehakk> That's no catch.

777581252077555712 2016-09-18 18:53:11 UTC <kylehakk> Duuuuuuuuuuuke
777581106002526208 2016-09-18 18:52:37 UTC <kylehakk> Suddenly we look like the Week 1 Browns again. Jesus.
777580676803616768 2016-09-18 18:50:54 UTC <kylehakk> If we didn't pick up that fumble I would have died.
777580272044814336 2016-09-18 18:49:18 UTC <kylehakk> If we don't score on this next drive, it's probably over.
777572334030970880 2016-09-18 18:17:45 UTC <kylehakk> I don't like sending the house after Flacco. Every time we do, they get a big gain. Let's dial it back some.
777566341146476545 2016-09-18 17:53:56 UTC <kylehakk> Snap infraction? Go fuck yourself with that lingo
777564677949812736 2016-09-18 17:47:20 UTC <kylehakk> Two guys dive on McCown, a guy pushes Thomas over a pile of bodies and no flag for a late hit.
777564355617587200 2016-09-18 17:46:03 UTC <kylehakk> We need another bottlegate after that. Fuck that.
777561414667997184 2016-09-18 17:34:22 UTC <kylehakk> Well hopefully the defense can play lights out because McCown is gone.
777560988455407620 2016-09-18 17:32:40 UTC <kylehakk> That kicker can fly. Holy shit.
777560672284672000 2016-09-18 17:31:25 UTC <kylehakk> This is amazing.
777558704317227012 2016-09-18 17:23:36 UTC <kylehakk> My dad just said "Crowell is gonna break one" fuck yeah!
777555896880750594 2016-09-18 17:12:26 UTC <kylehakk> Thanks to the shitty camera work, I'd say it's inconclusive.
777285051583229957 2016-09-17 23:16:12 UTC <kylehakk> Mentor is like home of hot moms.

776900182537633792 2016-09-16 21:46:52 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery it's like fast food quality meals. It sucks.
776814164425736201 2016-09-16 16:05:03 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery sho thang. I use the fx app since I don't have cable. And it crashed last week and I missed the first ten minutes.

776260129956167680 2016-09-14 03:23:31 UTC <kylehakk> There hasn't been a good season since Asylum, so I'm finally glad to be able to enjoy this show again. #AHS6
776259858978988033 2016-09-14 03:22:27 UTC <kylehakk> I literally only care about Sarah Paulson. This season is great so far. I'm seeing a lot of hate but I'm feeling it #AHS6
776246031377960960 2016-09-14 02:27:30 UTC <kylehakk> This is like an episode of Scooby-Doo #AHS6
776243917360603136 2016-09-14 02:19:06 UTC <kylehakk> @timheidecker a real pilot wouldn't even have to crash land his plane, he'd just land it REGULARLY
776243460739371008 2016-09-14 02:17:17 UTC <kylehakk> Sarah Paulson looking fine in that shirt #AHS6
776238347425550336 2016-09-14 01:56:58 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood i think they just needed somebody else to add. I didn't know he was from Erie though.
776237744217554944 2016-09-14 01:54:34 UTC <kylehakk> @ochocinco pecan waffle and a chicken breast.
776237612713578496 2016-09-14 01:54:03 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood he only ever played more than six games in a season twice. Super Bowl year and 07 when he was DPoY. Jesus.
776236999351078916 2016-09-14 01:51:37 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood he was really good in Madden. Only time he was ever healthy.
776236248654643200 2016-09-14 01:48:38 UTC <kylehakk> Dawkins better be first ballot. And how the fuck is Bob Sanders eligible? He played like six games.https://twitter.com/ProFootballHOF/status/776224428808167425
776204750509510656 2016-09-14 23:43:28 UTC <kylehakk> I'm gonna switch back to liquor. I'm tired of beer.
776200102247600133 2016-09-14 23:25:00 UTC <kylehakk> I really didn't want to like Atlanta because I'm still mad at Donald Glover for leaving Community, but it's actually a really good show.
776184780496961536 2016-09-14 22:24:07 UTC <kylehakk> Pamela Adlon is a genius.
776184513084862464 2016-09-14 22:23:03 UTC <kylehakk> @douggpound James Taylor
776184106568785922 2016-09-14 22:21:26 UTC <kylehakk> It's my whole life to just suggest chain restaurants to athletes who are on the road.
776183838686994434 2016-09-14 22:20:22 UTC <kylehakk> @Thee_AR15 olive garden
775733487479521280 2016-09-13 16:30:50 UTC <kylehakk> The only thing good about the Rams game last night, was how much worse they are than the Browns.
775119420507185152 2016-09-11 23:50:45 UTC <kylehakk> Like I said, shitty Colts defense is always going to cost them.
775114547283787778 2016-09-11 23:31:23 UTC <kylehakk> @ochocinco Terrelle Pryor looked pretty good. And Nassib. That's about it.
775113326577803264 2016-09-11 23:26:32 UTC <kylehakk> Williams fucked up
775113284919914496 2016-09-11 23:26:22 UTC <kylehakk> You think the Colts would have invested in a defense after all these years. Great QB play but they'll never go anywhere without a defense.
775112202009317376 2016-09-11 23:22:04 UTC <kylehakk> Let's see if Dak has the testicular fortitude
775110314438320128 2016-09-11 23:14:34 UTC <kylehakk> Maybe Tannehill is actually garbage?
775107064439902208 2016-09-11 23:01:39 UTC <kylehakk> Dwayne Allen really came through for my team with Gronk out. Brownie points to you Dwayne.
775105631812476928 2016-09-11 22:55:58 UTC <kylehakk> @HanfordTopDawg It's going to be ugly but it's for the greater good. Rookies looked better than most of the team. Good for the future.
775080501711368192 2016-09-11 21:16:06 UTC <kylehakk> Can somebody get ESPN's servers back online so  I can see how badly I'm losing?
775064164670771200 2016-09-11 20:11:11 UTC <kylehakk> This Jaguars game is awesome
775059835301793792 2016-09-11 19:53:59 UTC <kylehakk> RG3 broken arm. Great.
775059522100588544 2016-09-11 19:52:44 UTC <kylehakk> So are we going lineman, lineman with our two first round picks next year?
775055617727860736 2016-09-11 19:37:13 UTC <kylehakk> ONE WR OUT WIDE AND EVERYONE ON THE LINE AND WE STILL GET SACKED WTF
775039606526017536 2016-09-11 18:33:36 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood they said they were going to review it, but still let everyone go into the half anyways.
775038384800686084 2016-09-11 18:28:45 UTC <kylehakk> Man, we're just gonna ignore Hue Jackson calling timeout six times in two seconds? Wow. Horrible officiating.
775031043699019776 2016-09-11 17:59:34 UTC <kylehakk> I called the Jags over Green Bay as my upset. So far, so good. Keep driving @BBortles5
775030685623021569 2016-09-11 17:58:09 UTC <kylehakk> @TonyGrossi you're awful.
775030587350458373 2016-09-11 17:57:46 UTC <kylehakk> Caw! Caw! @IsaiahCrowell34 baby!!
775026815366733824 2016-09-11 17:42:46 UTC <kylehakk> I might turn this game off.
775024496206110721 2016-09-11 17:33:33 UTC <kylehakk> At least we have more yards than Buffalo
775024155683094529 2016-09-11 17:32:12 UTC <kylehakk> This is without a doubt, the worst play calling I've ever seen. Wow.
774995828767354880 2016-09-11 15:39:38 UTC <kylehakk> @TonyGrossi oh man, somebody should have told that to the team in the '70s.
774417341446782976 2016-09-09 01:20:56 UTC <kylehakk> I think I could probably worship Amy Poehler.
774064705182674944 2016-09-08 01:59:41 UTC <kylehakk> Having Kelvin Benjamin as a WR3 on my team is just unbelievably amazing.
774062005254709248 2016-09-08 01:48:58 UTC <kylehakk> I forgot football was on. Fuck Thursday night games. Forever.

773916568774438912 2016-09-08 16:11:03 UTC <kylehakk> Adult life is trash. It's easy to feel like nobody gives a shit about you, because nobody does.

772585434006298624 2016-09-04 00:01:36 UTC <kylehakk> Oh yeah the roof is scorched big time but I'm still going strong. I needed new skin up there anyways #oldmouthskin
772584707041230848 2016-09-04 23:58:42 UTC <kylehakk> Burning the roof of your mouth on pizza is just a reminder that the things we love the most can hurt us.

768219281364488192 2016-08-23 22:52:04 UTC <kylehakk> I've been trying to reconnect with old friends and nobody has the time of day. It makes me fucking sad.
767920925429919746 2016-08-22 03:06:30 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery anytime
767914593205248000 2016-08-22 02:41:20 UTC <kylehakk> I finally spoiled MGSV for myself and I God damn knew what the twist would be. So simple. That game really sucked dick. I'll never beat it.
767874059518545921 2016-08-22 00:00:16 UTC <kylehakk> Holy shit. Young @pattonoswalt on Seinfeld. That made my day.
767214328231632897 2016-08-20 04:18:44 UTC <kylehakk> I couldn't live with myself if I had cankles
767069337404502016 2016-08-20 18:42:36 UTC <kylehakk> I love the "go for it on 4th down on the first drive and immediately quit upon failing" players.
767027817771069440 2016-08-20 15:57:37 UTC <kylehakk> Why does Andy Dalton sound like a black guy?
767025080274657281 2016-08-20 15:46:44 UTC <kylehakk> I think the Bears have the best uniforms.
767017509073653760 2016-08-20 15:16:39 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood also, they changed the kicking back to the three button A press system. Everyone is missing field goals. Probably young.
767017144181743617 2016-08-20 15:15:12 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood that's what I like. I love playing as Legends.
767016554261258245 2016-08-20 15:12:51 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood i definitely like that a lot. I had Christian Okoye once and it was amazing.
767015251510497284 2016-08-20 15:07:41 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood I basically did until '15. I'm trying to get back into them, but they're just so bland anymore.
767013607490158592 2016-08-20 15:01:09 UTC <kylehakk> Now 4 INTs
767013433422340101 2016-08-20 15:00:27 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood i did some of the easy ones like the stadiums or coaches. Ended up getting Mike Tomlin and was pissed.
767013151674171392 2016-08-20 14:59:20 UTC <kylehakk> I have 3 INTs and 3 fumbles. Any time I'm tackled it's a fumble. I have 47 total yard of offense. This is dumb.
767012952532811777 2016-08-20 14:58:32 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood it's still that way. It takes so long that I can't even stay committed to finish them.
767011634938257408 2016-08-20 14:53:18 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood i know what you mean. I did in '12. Whichever the Peyton Hillis one was. I got Barry Sanders and it was basically cheating.
767010596315332609 2016-08-20 14:49:11 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood same. I only used auction house, but the fun was opening packs and they just keep making them harder to get.
767009758041804801 2016-08-20 14:45:51 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood and I think they lowered the coins you get per win now. I swear it was at least 1000 before, but I only received 500
767008932690788352 2016-08-20 14:42:34 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood micro-transactions rule the world.
767008591664603136 2016-08-20 14:41:13 UTC <kylehakk> The reason I love Ultimate Team is building my team up gradually. I wouldn't just want to jump to the peak immediately.
767008391659155456 2016-08-20 14:40:25 UTC <kylehakk> He has six elite players. Elite packs are five bucks a piece. He's spent thirty dollars on his team so far. How is that fun?
767006543405514752 2016-08-20 14:33:04 UTC <kylehakk> I hate Ultimate Team. I just played a great game with two shitty 67 overall teams. Now I play a kid who bought his team. 67 OVR v. 88 OVR
766994102579818496 2016-08-20 13:43:38 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood this just changed my life
766815014086971392 2016-08-19 01:52:00 UTC <kylehakk> Are you supposed to lose the opening in Madden 17? It went all slow motion and then Tavon Austin just drops it. Wtf.
766808015479726080 2016-08-19 01:24:12 UTC <kylehakk> Finally watched Bee Movie. @JerrySeinfeld just proves his wit time and time again. I don't understand all the negativity #sequelplease
766741084735213568 2016-08-19 20:58:14 UTC <kylehakk> I know it's petty but I don't wish anyone Happy Birthday on Facebook unless they wished me one.
766497255545339904 2016-08-18 04:49:21 UTC <kylehakk> Had some good vibes on my Testaverde jersey too. Swell night.
766486495704252416 2016-08-18 04:06:35 UTC <kylehakk> I couldn't bring myself to boo @alexmack55 tonight. Everyone around me did, but he was one of my favorites.
766040283633029120 2016-08-17 22:33:30 UTC <kylehakk> You ever meet someone who talked so much shit on others, but had no room to talk? Yeah...
765007910724308992 2016-08-14 02:11:13 UTC <kylehakk> Why are there no nice Jewish girls around here?
764844075837194240 2016-08-14 15:20:12 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery he's my dude
764825546719133697 2016-08-14 14:06:34 UTC <kylehakk> I wish the Bears would have beat the Colts in that Super Bowl
764812857653485568 2016-08-14 13:16:09 UTC <kylehakk> @LaniesRecovery what?! Steve is the coolest dude
764306981171687424 2016-08-12 03:45:59 UTC <kylehakk> I never had my ho phase.
764290373552336896 2016-08-12 02:39:59 UTC <kylehakk> Cody Kessler's first drive, first play TD. Second drive, runs out of the end zone for a safety haha. Rookies, man.
764271952655740929 2016-08-12 01:26:47 UTC <kylehakk> That's just Clay Matthews playing tight end
764267245191266304 2016-08-12 01:08:05 UTC <kylehakk> Good to see Brian Hoyer in the crowd.
764266990370484224 2016-08-12 01:07:04 UTC <kylehakk> I'm so excited for @TerrellePryor this year. He looks so dedicated on that sideline.
764260935397670912 2016-08-12 00:43:00 UTC <kylehakk> There hasn't been anything ruled uncatchable in the last two years. Believe me, I bitch about it all time.
764258182663471106 2016-08-12 00:32:04 UTC <kylehakk> Ah fuck.
764257808321744897 2016-08-12 00:30:35 UTC <kylehakk> Ed Hochuli praying to God.

764257049345658880 2016-08-12 00:27:34 UTC <kylehakk> That's what preseason is for. Iron out those wrinkles.
763920359032664070 2016-08-11 02:09:41 UTC <kylehakk> It's not fair that testicles are ugly.
763905121755492352 2016-08-11 01:09:08 UTC <kylehakk> I'm avoiding all Broncos receivers this year.

763879281302855681 2016-08-11 23:26:27 UTC <kylehakk> Well that was jaw dropping...

761398985093414912 2016-08-04 03:10:38 UTC <kylehakk> She looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue. He knew right then he was too far from home.
761398824476741633 2016-08-04 03:10:00 UTC <kylehakk> She stood there bright as the Sun on that California coast. He was a Midwestern boy on his own.

760629009067675649 2016-08-02 00:11:02 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood sounds good. My other league sent out a notice about it and I figured I'd do both at the same time. Crisis averted.
760628655638839296 2016-08-02 00:09:37 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood no keepers this year?

760582050588061696 2016-08-02 21:04:26 UTC <kylehakk> Asking someone's Father for permission to marry them is so fucking gross and outdated. Humans aren't property.
760311316447948800 2016-08-01 03:08:38 UTC <kylehakk> I think I might surprise my Dad with tickets to the Christmas Eve game against the Chargers.
759933632211476480 2016-07-31 02:07:51 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood I know. You had to go and ruin a good thing for me. Nah, I'll live.

759775054301388800 2016-07-31 15:37:43 UTC <kylehakk> @JLucroy20 apparently doesn't want to play into October. Why play more baseball when he can just sit at home? #Indians

757975667984195584 2016-07-26 16:27:36 UTC <kylehakk> I want @RGIII @JOSH_GORDONXII @TheCoreyColeman to just go off this year so they can the "Bad News Bears" I want a scary offense.

751551406440607744 2016-07-08 22:59:53 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon I know! The people across the street were on their porch staring at me, while I'm staring at my phone in someone else's yard.
751550419512528896 2016-07-08 22:55:57 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon it's fucking weird. I had to go stand in my neighbors yard like a fuckhead to catch a Weedle.
751520903117275136 2016-07-08 20:58:40 UTC <kylehakk> I wasn't gonna play Pokemon Go, but I think I might.

750887852288991232 2016-07-06 03:03:09 UTC <kylehakk> So does Jimmy Butler go back to the bench? There's no way him, Rondo, and Wade are all on the court at once.
750883144887332864 2016-07-06 02:44:27 UTC <kylehakk> I really can't believe Wade is gonna be a Chicago Bull.

749259469062828032 2016-07-02 15:12:32 UTC <kylehakk> These 80s commercials evoke feelings in me. They're so warm. Made me actually want to get McDonald's.

749257445730582528 2016-07-02 15:04:30 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood that's insane. But I respect it. I hope this is the year I finally win it. Tired of falling short right at the end.
749257254105387009 2016-07-02 15:03:44 UTC <kylehakk> It's dumb that I'm even optimistic about this year. They'll be 3-13, but there's a magic in the air over Cleveland.
749257121439571968 2016-07-02 15:03:12 UTC <kylehakk> Watching the 1986 AFC Divisional Playoff game between the Browns and the Jets. I can't wait until the Browns are there again.

744711822687731712 2016-06-19 02:01:49 UTC <kylehakk> Golden State gets drastically better when Varejao is benched. He won't see the court for the rest of the night.
744710153040199680 2016-06-19 01:55:11 UTC <kylehakk> All these bitchy looking mom-types in the Oracle whining at the refs. Ugh. #fuckcalifornia #CavsWarriors #NBAFinals

744697711547527169 2016-06-19 01:05:44 UTC <kylehakk> Green will cool off. The whole Warriors squad is playing terribly. We have to get ahead before they get back into a rhythm. Also Im tweeting

742125525716635648 2016-06-12 22:44:48 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood I don't understand. Skyrim sucked. They should remaster Morrowind without the awful combat system.

741701609865023488 2016-06-11 18:40:18 UTC <kylehakk> Party chat ruined Xbox live. I've been playing Overwatch everyday, for a week straight and have only heard 2 other people. Jesus Christ.

740720280654499840 2016-06-08 01:40:51 UTC <kylehakk> Warriors fans nowadays are like "who the fuck is Baron Davis?"

736738568119410688 2016-05-28 01:58:57 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood exactly. The game of thrones one kind of pissed me off. I liked it, but it's not as good since most characters are invincible.

727298928161480704 2016-05-02 00:49:11 UTC <kylehakk> It's been over a year since I've enjoyed  a Game of Thrones episode. It's about damn time.
726781779403784196 2016-05-01 14:34:13 UTC <kylehakk> I think I have to become a @BUFootball fan just because of all the players my @Browns took.
726533194305130496 2016-04-30 22:06:26 UTC <kylehakk> @kumailn I love all the actresses in that movie, but that trailer is fucking bad, man. It sucks not being able to voice an opinion about it
726532880860614656 2016-04-30 22:05:11 UTC <kylehakk> @MichaelEmerson is amazing as Ben Linus. Terrific acting. My girlfriend has no idea that he's not really Henry Gale. I love Lost noobs.
726485011638194177 2016-04-30 18:54:58 UTC <kylehakk> I love that Ric Flair is a Cavs fan.https://twitter.com/RicFlairNatrBoy/status/726467367870582784
726394511216250881 2016-04-30 12:55:21 UTC <kylehakk> I had a dream about Ashley Benson. It wasn't exciting. We just watched TV.
726246563819966464 2016-04-29 03:07:28 UTC <kylehakk> I'm all for a project QB.
726245810212622336 2016-04-29 03:04:28 UTC <kylehakk> My forearms are so nice but the rest of me is trash
726239508732190720 2016-04-29 02:39:26 UTC <kylehakk> Michelle Rodriguez is fine. I want her to like spit on me or something. Beautiful.

725853889048793088 2016-04-28 01:07:07 UTC <kylehakk> I love all these analysts saying these players are better than Tunsil and acting like that gas mask video didn't happen #NFLDraft2016
725853748493451266 2016-04-28 01:06:34 UTC <kylehakk> I swear if Treadwell is gone... It's possible he could still be there, ugh. I can't lose faith.
725848575050133504 2016-04-28 00:46:00 UTC <kylehakk> I forgot they signed Gipson. So actually they're even less pieces away than I thought.
725847866456068096 2016-04-28 00:43:11 UTC <kylehakk> Jags must go defense. That team is a few key pieces from the playoffs, and they're all on defense.
725847120234876928 2016-04-28 00:40:13 UTC <kylehakk> Zeke is gonna run wild behind that line. Oh fuck.
725841398625390592 2016-04-28 00:17:29 UTC <kylehakk> Selecting QB's at 1&2 never works out for one team. There's like never been a great 1&2 combo. One team is going to bust.

725838076895985664 2016-04-28 00:04:17 UTC <kylehakk> It pisses me off so much that the Rams didn't go back to blue and yellow. That navy and gold is so ugly.
725796607946530818 2016-04-28 21:19:30 UTC <kylehakk> I still think Assassin's Creed Black Flag is one of the best games I've ever played. I constantly want to replay it.
725724827236077568 2016-04-28 16:34:16 UTC <kylehakk> I wish lunch break lasted the rest of the day.

724039334576447488 2016-04-23 00:56:44 UTC <kylehakk> @ArynCochran probably also same.
724037817500876800 2016-04-23 00:50:42 UTC <kylehakk> Thank you @ArynCochran for that favorite. Jordan is my hero.
724037491632824321 2016-04-23 00:49:24 UTC <kylehakk> Yeah, sorry. I like wrestling. Sue me.
724037440076414978 2016-04-23 00:49:12 UTC <kylehakk> I hate watching wrestling without @JordanWallace_9 because nobody appreciates it as much as he does. It's much more fun when you're in to it
723724626484965376 2016-04-22 04:06:11 UTC <kylehakk> @THR @pattonoswalt sorry for your loss. I look up to you. May she rest in peace.

721843463524892674 2016-04-17 23:31:07 UTC <kylehakk> I don't wanna play the Heat. They've had our number all year and they look white hot right now
721812539110252544 2016-04-17 21:28:14 UTC <kylehakk> @THE_ELPRESADOR Cavs up 102-96,  35 seconds to go
721812425511714816 2016-04-17 21:27:47 UTC <kylehakk> Reggie Jackson just blew that possession. Literally held the ball for 24 seconds. He fucking sucks. Go Cavs
721810472174006272 2016-04-17 21:20:01 UTC <kylehakk> Hahaha fuck Reggie Jackson with that whack ass haircut
721809777840533504 2016-04-17 21:17:16 UTC <kylehakk> I forgot how much I fucking despise Jeff Van Gundy

721735873612615680 2016-04-17 16:23:36 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood Yeah, but it's weird in 4. The dimensions aren't right. Scaling is off or something. I haven't lost a game yet, so not all bad
721718423575769090 2016-04-17 15:14:15 UTC <kylehakk> We can play Shotty Swords on Midship, and they fucking vote for oddball on halo 4 remake of The Pit. I hate this game.
721714517722447872 2016-04-17 14:58:44 UTC <kylehakk> Brian Adams makes no sense in the nWo.

721452593080373248 2016-04-16 21:37:56 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood seriously. And I hate a timer for weapon respawns. We timed that shit ourselves back in the day. Separates the boys from men.
721449885405487104 2016-04-16 21:27:11 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood the true Spartans...
721449603309178880 2016-04-16 21:26:03 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood they are! It's such a bad game. I have no fun when I play it.
721447554710417409 2016-04-16 21:17:55 UTC <kylehakk> Halo 4 shouldn't be in the master chief collection. Why does anyone vote for it when they call play 2 or 3? Ugh
721445351908093956 2016-04-16 21:09:10 UTC <kylehakk> @ArianFoster everyone's gonna throw out suggestions like he hasn't already tried them.
721443599192301568 2016-04-16 21:02:12 UTC <kylehakk> The back and forth between @rickygervais and @RalfLittle has made my day
721118144635486208 2016-04-15 23:28:58 UTC <kylehakk> And nobody ever texts back.
721118008329039872 2016-04-15 23:28:25 UTC <kylehakk> And the new season of Kimmy Schmidt kinda sucks. This weekend is off to a terrible start.

717511189207588864 2016-04-05 00:36:12 UTC <kylehakk> @jaycrawfordespn I mean, you're not wrong though. I've just seen many people giving up already. I'm also stupidly optimistic of CLE sports.
717460324425793536 2016-04-05 21:14:05 UTC <kylehakk> @jaycrawfordespn one game and it's against Price, and you're already defeated. Okay.
716817335248666625 2016-04-03 02:39:05 UTC <kylehakk> @RealDDP so glad to see you hit the Diamond Cutter one more time. Most electrifying move in the history of our sport.

716452612225236992 2016-04-02 02:29:48 UTC <kylehakk> I love Snoop Dogg's music, but I'm glad I missed his wrestling career. #wwehof

715720968803639296 2016-03-31 02:02:31 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood I didn't care for it. It's basically that. I don't know. Mediocre?

714593008457482244 2016-03-28 23:20:24 UTC <kylehakk> I don't understand why people are just dickheads to celebrities. I just want to be happy and everyone else to be happy too. It's simple.

708824172722528258 2016-03-12 01:17:06 UTC <kylehakk> I started watching wrestling just for a little nostalgia kick, but now I'm like neck deep into it.
708461545483837440 2016-03-11 01:16:09 UTC <kylehakk> @EBischoff just watched Halloween Havoc 97 earlier. Was that guy who scaled the cage at the end a plant or some crazy fan?

706671467128299520 2016-03-06 02:43:01 UTC <kylehakk> Girls who like hockey are hot. Unless they're ugly, then there's no saving them.
706670769162555392 2016-03-06 02:40:15 UTC <kylehakk> I just buried my face deep in pillows to sneeze because my gf is asleep and I have control of the TV. No shame.

697453532144910337 2016-02-10 16:14:14 UTC <kylehakk> My thumb only spasms when I'm creeping on Instagram. Pisses me off.
696896976592494592 2016-02-08 03:22:41 UTC <kylehakk> Boobs are good.

696561417231691776 2016-02-07 05:09:18 UTC <kylehakk> Mariska Hargitay is so fine. I've never even watched SVU. Just commercials do it for me.
696555990112665600 2016-02-07 04:47:44 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood me too. I'll have to go full time hockey goon.
696550240195911680 2016-02-07 04:24:53 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood you and me both.
696542192748359681 2016-02-07 03:52:54 UTC <kylehakk> I can't even think of a funny commercial that happened. The #TMNT2 trailer wins by default.
696540346730336256 2016-02-07 03:45:34 UTC <kylehakk> @joelmchale how much have you drank?
696539582905610241 2016-02-07 03:42:32 UTC <kylehakk> Von Miller carries Peyton to the victory and Peyton makes him buy the beer #scumbag
696539109779701760 2016-02-07 03:40:39 UTC <kylehakk> I bet Elvis Dumervil is pissed that fax didn't go through.
696538221073846277 2016-02-07 03:37:07 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood he'll just levitate into the sky with the trophy. That'd be so awesome.
696537931687817216 2016-02-07 03:35:58 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood Jesus Christ to hand it off to Peyton Manning confirmed.
696537807033073664 2016-02-07 03:35:28 UTC <kylehakk> I'm just here to see if Manning retires and Miller gets MVP
696537751596957696 2016-02-07 03:35:15 UTC <kylehakk> Are they gonna hand this off to fifty guys?
696537161458458624 2016-02-07 03:32:54 UTC <kylehakk> Ben Affleck. #mmmmm #hunk
696535775933001729 2016-02-07 03:27:24 UTC <kylehakk> The commercials were an all time bad this year. Everything sucked about this milestone Super Bowl.
696535292946358272 2016-02-07 03:25:29 UTC <kylehakk> Peyton Manning to the Jets, then Vikings, and also a dick pic scandal #5yearplan
696534959889235969 2016-02-07 03:24:10 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood 11 seconds, 1 second, 20 seconds, 2 minutes, game over!
696534637162663936 2016-02-07 03:22:53 UTC <kylehakk> What was the timeclock  manager doing?
696534361387200513 2016-02-07 03:21:47 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 me too, talking to my dad. I said Cam would be rattled. Nobody's ready for their first Super Bowl.
696534081581019137 2016-02-07 03:20:40 UTC <kylehakk> Also congrats to @BossWard43
696533895072915458 2016-02-07 03:19:56 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 to beat Cam, just literally blitz the shit out of him.
696533541916712960 2016-02-07 03:18:32 UTC <kylehakk> The Panthers will be back. Nerves got the better of Cam and that crazy Denver D. Still happy for The Sheriff.
696531453161635841 2016-02-07 03:10:14 UTC <kylehakk> Why is eyevision360 and pylon cameras not a regular thing?
696531279576170496 2016-02-07 03:09:32 UTC <kylehakk> Eli's like "fuck, now we have the same amount of rings" Your reign of terror is over, Eli!
696530703605956608 2016-02-07 03:07:15 UTC <kylehakk> Peyton Manning hasn't done shit but I guarantee he'll get MVP.
696530152034017280 2016-02-07 03:05:03 UTC <kylehakk> That'll do it.
696529914686808064 2016-02-07 03:04:07 UTC <kylehakk> Absolutely uncatchable
696528299019911168 2016-02-07 02:57:42 UTC <kylehakk> No Calvin, no Lynch. Football is going to be even more weird next year.
696527549107695616 2016-02-07 02:54:43 UTC <kylehakk> Helen Mirren has really great cleavage for an old lady
696524780846125061 2016-02-07 02:43:43 UTC <kylehakk> Fuck your trash games. I hope whoever made this gets diarrhea in their sleep.https://twitter.com/EAMaddenNFL/status/696522443054145536
696523168480157697 2016-02-07 02:37:18 UTC <kylehakk> Did I miss the Drake commercial? I kept hearing stuff about it, but nothing
696521555115950080 2016-02-07 02:30:54 UTC <kylehakk> I'M SO FUCKING PISSED THIS ISN'T SEAL
696518012514525184 2016-02-07 02:16:49 UTC <kylehakk> Get it, TJ! Get it, Ginn! My words during this game. Still undecided.
696517869274861569 2016-02-07 02:16:15 UTC <kylehakk> Wow shit got real for a minute
696517124622307328 2016-02-07 02:13:17 UTC <kylehakk> What a catch! #GoBucks
696516106517934083 2016-02-07 02:09:15 UTC <kylehakk> Oh, hi Mark!
696515607278317568 2016-02-07 02:07:16 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood not that damn thug, Cam Newton!
696515216356597762 2016-02-07 02:05:42 UTC <kylehakk> Someday a celebrity will accept my marriage request and I'll have some horrible news for my girlfriend.
696515090871422976 2016-02-07 02:05:12 UTC <kylehakk> @AADaddario marry me
696514986483564550 2016-02-07 02:04:48 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood looked like he jumped early for sure.
696513237328728064 2016-02-07 01:57:51 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon I'm sorry. I ruined it for everyone.
696512654152757249 2016-02-07 01:55:31 UTC <kylehakk> Does anybody want to be friends?
696511298297843716 2016-02-07 01:50:08 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon that's why they're just fantasies I suppose #bummed
696511039874142208 2016-02-07 01:49:07 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon I know. There isn't one, but I feel like she can't be bought.
696510679809945600 2016-02-07 01:47:41 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon if only I won that damn Powerball, I could have paid for that. Or at least a cheap knock off.
696509514405801985 2016-02-07 01:43:03 UTC <kylehakk> Alec Baldwin is also my idol
696509468494950400 2016-02-07 01:42:52 UTC <kylehakk> Not a bad halftime show.
696508665977835521 2016-02-07 01:39:41 UTC <kylehakk> I would like Beyonc to crush my head with her thighs. That'd be the best way to die.
696506451397898240 2016-02-07 01:30:53 UTC <kylehakk> Why isn't Steph Curry drumming?
696506174515126272 2016-02-07 01:29:47 UTC <kylehakk> At least they played Yellow for five seconds...
696501256534278144 2016-02-07 01:10:14 UTC <kylehakk> Jeff Goldblum is my idol
696500909615013888 2016-02-07 01:08:51 UTC <kylehakk> This game started out hot, but the defenses found their footing and I'm bored.
696499967494615040 2016-02-07 01:05:07 UTC <kylehakk> Peyton holding right on the analog stick when he let that one go.
696499485074182145 2016-02-07 01:03:12 UTC <kylehakk> That was terrible
696498962270965760 2016-02-07 01:01:07 UTC <kylehakk> Jeeaaa CJ
696497673277411328 2016-02-07 00:56:00 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood I'm 85% percent sure I heard them say that.
696497039878787073 2016-02-07 00:53:29 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood the guy blocked him into the punter, I thought they said.
696496869824925696 2016-02-07 00:52:48 UTC <kylehakk> What the fuck? That wasn't Steve Carrell?
696492879875862528 2016-02-07 00:36:57 UTC <kylehakk> TJ Ward, Fozzy Whitaker, Jordan Norwood. So many ex-Browns.
696492158262644737 2016-02-07 00:34:05 UTC <kylehakk> I love Amy Schumer. Tell the world.
696489727894155265 2016-02-07 00:24:25 UTC <kylehakk> Matt Damon back as Jason Bourne. Hell yeah!
696487996766482432 2016-02-07 00:17:33 UTC <kylehakk> @nottjmiller !!!!! Have my super bowl baby!
696485155054211077 2016-02-07 00:06:15 UTC <kylehakk> Bullshit call. Wow. Mike Carey wrong again though, so that's nothing new.
696478194803863553 2016-02-07 23:38:36 UTC <kylehakk> I. Fucking. Hate. Steph. Curry.
696476729930604544 2016-02-07 23:32:46 UTC <kylehakk> John Goodman is one of my favorite actors.
696476592810414080 2016-02-07 23:32:14 UTC <kylehakk> Wouldn't it just be awful if Peyton choked so bad they had to bench him? #SB50
696476148058976256 2016-02-07 23:30:28 UTC <kylehakk> That lady wasn't a very good dancer #SB50
696407616336097280 2016-02-07 18:58:09 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood he died as he lived...
696407128148463621 2016-02-07 18:56:12 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood Yeah, but he needs another. Going out on top would be great. Oh shit, Jared Allen and Peanut Tillman. Fuck! So conflicted.
696406687423528960 2016-02-07 18:54:27 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood Panthers are young, energetic, charismatic. But then guys like Peyton, Ware, Miller, deserve some hardware. Vernon Davis too.
696405713040576512 2016-02-07 18:50:35 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood I've never been more conflicted on who I want to win.
696405269711101953 2016-02-07 18:48:49 UTC <kylehakk> I really want to play Assassin's Creed 2 all over again.
696049082956173312 2016-02-06 19:13:28 UTC <kylehakk> Lex Luger is the shit.
695339319519637505 2016-02-04 20:13:07 UTC <kylehakk> I love watching old Steiner Brothers matches. True tag team wrestling.
695062337003372544 2016-02-03 01:52:29 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 booooo
693710453936132097 2016-01-31 08:20:35 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 you missed out on everything lol
693709703231176704 2016-01-31 08:17:36 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 same. Waiting for Sting to change his makeup and wreck people with the bat.
693709206277509120 2016-01-31 08:15:37 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 do it. I'm just searching for stuff to watch. Probably the WCW Nitro that followed the Bash at the Beach we watched.
693708772712251392 2016-01-31 08:13:54 UTC <kylehakk> @JordanWallace_9 yo Wrestlemania 14 is wild.
693707744885477376 2016-01-31 08:09:49 UTC <kylehakk> Not that my opinion matters on a woman's body but I liked Khloe Kardashian about twenty pounds ago. She's still fine though.
692820888782311424 2016-01-28 21:25:46 UTC <kylehakk> @UncleBlazer if I had a ten second blurb on TRL, I'd tell the whole world I love you.
692559906268913664 2016-01-27 04:08:43 UTC <kylehakk> @Theorossi I thought you were for real, and now I'm sad.
692442623458545664 2016-01-27 20:22:41 UTC <kylehakk> These old school Nick shows were harsh on the runner ups. You know if you lost, your ass was going home with chocolate syrup and Skechers.
692441677626220548 2016-01-27 20:18:55 UTC <kylehakk> Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, The Giant, Sting, Lex Luger, Konnan I guess. My childhood would have sucked without the nWo
692432425104883712 2016-01-27 19:42:09 UTC <kylehakk> Wrestling will never be as good as the WCW/nWo days.
691906199843966981 2016-01-26 08:51:07 UTC <kylehakk> Feeling nostalgic so I've just been watching Nick Arcade on YouTube all night. @PhilMoore4u you are a great host.
691452351606034432 2016-01-24 02:47:41 UTC <kylehakk> Carson Palmer is so fucking bad!
691449069261176832 2016-01-24 02:34:39 UTC <kylehakk> @RikkiTooGood everybody counted them out without Benjamin, but they don't need him. They'll be even scarier next year.
691438563410444288 2016-01-24 01:52:54 UTC <kylehakk> Gods of Egypt? More like green screen: the movie
691430231580737536 2016-01-24 01:19:48 UTC <kylehakk> Palmer is blowing it.
691430190279462914 2016-01-24 01:19:38 UTC <kylehakk> Teddy Ginn is so fucking fast
691404178359488512 2016-01-24 23:36:16 UTC <kylehakk> Legendary game for two of the greatest QB's of my generation. Manning has to win it all.
691403083016978440 2016-01-24 23:31:55 UTC <kylehakk> Wowzers.
691402686017716224 2016-01-24 23:30:20 UTC <kylehakk> Wow. This is an amazing game.
691359432295452672 2016-01-24 20:38:28 UTC <kylehakk> It's early but New England looks like shit.
691358397338406916 2016-01-24 20:34:21 UTC <kylehakk> I hate that Denver doesn't rock the navy blue uniforms anymore. I hate that nasty ass orange.
691356313629126657 2016-01-24 20:26:04 UTC <kylehakk> It's crazy how quickly I fell in love with Fallout 4 and then out of love with Fallout 4.
691355052380950528 2016-01-24 20:21:03 UTC <kylehakk> Owen Daniels hasn't been that open in four years.
691337907114745857 2016-01-24 19:12:56 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon that's the only way I can get her to do anything. Wait, what?
691333504991391745 2016-01-24 18:55:26 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon holy shit that's fast. I watched it when it originally ran and didn't realize how much I've forgotten. I'll ambush her with it.
691332653539266560 2016-01-24 18:52:03 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon it's seriously the best thing that's ever happened to my life.
691332352824512512 2016-01-24 18:50:51 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon she's the woooOooorst. She just knows the finale made people mad, so it won't be worth watching.
691332062834462720 2016-01-24 18:49:42 UTC <kylehakk> I think it's bullshit that I can't watch hockey all the time.
691331926221791232 2016-01-24 18:49:10 UTC <kylehakk> @Isayrlon I keep wanting to, also. But I can't get Maya on board.
690789355389067264 2016-01-22 06:53:11 UTC <kylehakk> I've binged most of @TheGoldbergsABC on Hulu the past week or so.  @RealTroyGentile is too fucking funny.
