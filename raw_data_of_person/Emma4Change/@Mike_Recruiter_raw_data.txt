959233424535052290 2018-02-01 01:14:04 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @LaneSutton @JenKnowsHR Yeah, theyll ask for more. But theyre also made aware that each candidate that has both also has options.

959209956263284736 2018-02-01 23:40:49 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @LaneSutton @JenKnowsHR all said, if given only those 2 choices. I'm going with 3/5 skills and passion.
959209568222855168 2018-02-01 23:39:16 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @LaneSutton @JenKnowsHR Me? For my $ & piece of mind, I'll take both! The feedback I get from execs is "Don't bring me either or. Go find me candidates that have both." Maybe, it's just me, I'm afforded little room for platitudes (Simon Sinekisms) AKA "hire attitude, you can always teach skill"

959203033463828480 2018-02-01 23:13:18 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @LaneSutton @JenKnowsHR The further I get from skill/experience the shakier my business case for hiring gets. I need to bring people w/experience & skill. Lacking experience? OK, we'll dive deep into capability. But I don't think passion trumps skill.

951172774994890752 2018-01-10 19:23:56 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @animal Telling in recruiting = explaining about the job, benefits of working there, perks, etc. Its educating the prospect. Selling = learning & listening to THEIR needs/wants, addressing concerns before they become objections, if theres a match, closing on those correlations.

951151546351472642 2018-01-10 17:59:34 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @animal @BillyMcDiarmid I just can't imagine anyone speaking to me (or someone like the ppl I know) in that tone and walking away from it scott free. Tone is probably much more important than language in this conversation.
951149101034418176 2018-01-10 17:49:51 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @animal @BillyMcDiarmid I can't speak for the rest of America. I just don't curse nearly as much as the guest. And I thought I cursed alot. During meetings with Presidents, VP's, Directors, or even applicants, candidates and coworkers there isn't much cursing going on. Maybe it's just me.

951144318202413056 2018-01-10 17:30:51 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @animal show is becoming a middle school delight. Gratuitous cursing, in place of real explanations, to drive home overgeneralized points.

951140338269384704 2018-01-10 17:15:02 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @animal being at a giant company isn't always going to be a positive angle in recruiting - At large companies you may simply get plugged into a system that you can't change or step out of.

949264946403184641 2018-01-05 13:02:54 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @CelesteHeadlee @TheArtOfCharm Part 2/2 - Over the past several years some would say my technique suffered in favor of having better conversations & gaining a truer understanding of a candidate & what he/she is in search of or what their career is in need of, but it made for better relationships & placements.
949264475181416448 2018-01-05 13:01:02 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @CelesteHeadlee @TheArtOfCharm Part 1/2 - 1st thing that comes to mind... calling out the BS advice on faking engagement (eye contact, repeat what they said). As a rookie recruiter YEARS ago, interviewing ppl became more difficult & less fruitful when I was simply trying to display interest/engagement.

946027565365518336 2017-12-27 14:38:42 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> I've got the weirdest luck in recruiting.

913029630650699776 2017-09-27 13:16:41 UTC <Mike_Recruiter> @animal They are testing the idea of increasing the character limit to 280
