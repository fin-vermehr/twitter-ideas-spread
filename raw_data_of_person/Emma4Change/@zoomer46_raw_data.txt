970411338953641984 2018-03-04 21:31:07 UTC <zoomer46> @Bjorkian15 @Emma4Change The NRA really has their finger on the pulse of the nation.

970352637169238016 2018-03-04 17:37:51 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic GOP is a party of despicable putzes.
969982030824996864 2018-03-03 17:05:12 UTC <zoomer46> @Radical_Birch @eluna333 Don't do it. It's vastly over rated.
969981830081449984 2018-03-03 17:04:24 UTC <zoomer46> I took the car to the car wash. The car is in the garage and now I won't go anywhere.
969947537510682625 2018-03-03 14:48:08 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Good to know.
969751810872434688 2018-03-02 01:50:23 UTC <zoomer46> @SocialPowerOne1 Another religious mind job heard from.
969721150631763968 2018-03-02 23:48:33 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc It doesnt do the whole house just the essentials.

969717309949562889 2018-03-02 23:33:17 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc Has a gasoline engine. Was around 1k plus some electrical work. Probably done for $1500
969716825234853890 2018-03-02 23:31:22 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc I have a general 7600 watt but I have to take it out side start it and flip some switches in the basement.
969716238090981377 2018-03-02 23:29:02 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc Do you want it to operate automatically?
969702487509946368 2018-03-02 22:34:23 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Stay safe. And warm.
969669045984391170 2018-03-02 20:21:30 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Yeah right. Never seen a Kroger.
969668445754286082 2018-03-02 20:19:07 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Ha. Great plan. Let me know if it works!
969666982130913280 2018-03-02 20:13:18 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo They do.
969666584640880640 2018-03-02 20:11:43 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc I have been waiting for a sign for a long time. My guess is that its not happening.
969576678640046083 2018-03-02 14:14:28 UTC <zoomer46> @PoliticsNewz Not exactly a huge loss.
969343528714293252 2018-03-01 22:48:01 UTC <zoomer46> @kasie Trump seems like such an impulsive human being.
969018932895145984 2018-02-28 01:18:11 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll I gave Stevie wonder five in Manchester New Hampshire once. It was all downhill for me after that.
968968534989656070 2018-02-28 21:57:55 UTC <zoomer46> @JumpTheRework @keithboykin The plot thickens.
968953976959000576 2018-02-28 21:00:05 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @sheLLbeLL_xo The natives are getting restless.
968946575157485568 2018-02-28 20:30:40 UTC <zoomer46> @InvPac Have they completely taken leave of their senses?
968945816709795840 2018-02-28 20:27:39 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa You've got that right.
968944766258999296 2018-02-28 20:23:29 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa When is this cretin up for re-election?
968941368134504450 2018-02-28 20:09:58 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @Mistress_Jan Wa. Wa. Trumpy want some cheese with that whine.
968940958091042816 2018-02-28 20:08:21 UTC <zoomer46> @ChrisMurphyCT Chris Murphy. Making sense again.
968937200351096832 2018-02-28 19:53:25 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 I dont get it either.
968936333770182656 2018-02-28 19:49:58 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic The wheels are coming off.
968846827889004544 2018-02-28 13:54:18 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 I am hoping the wheels are falling off the GOP bus.
968595884987637765 2018-02-27 21:17:09 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll Just in case they don't get lucky with the first four. Genius I tell ya. Pure genius.
968273334176804864 2018-02-26 23:55:27 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie @ddale8 Trump just can't keep his mouth shut..
968267238548615175 2018-02-26 23:31:13 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 very sweet.
968250436519153665 2018-02-26 22:24:27 UTC <zoomer46> @fireheather @RedTRaccoon Another patriot heard from.
968250113964625920 2018-02-26 22:23:11 UTC <zoomer46> @IsaacDovere Oh. I get it. He'd rather SEND unarmed people in after the shooter.
968249672358924289 2018-02-26 22:21:25 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind There they go courting the woman voter again.
968249195139395584 2018-02-26 22:19:31 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @DavidCornDC don't ever stop.
968207790874427393 2018-02-26 19:35:00 UTC <zoomer46> @SallyAlbright I think he did.
968204479144357890 2018-02-26 19:21:50 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 I wish I had the shred it contract with these guys.
968203309575278593 2018-02-26 19:17:12 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie After all these years and it still fits.
968202938014425090 2018-02-26 19:15:43 UTC <zoomer46> @DavidCornDC Heroic or desperate.
968198589578186754 2018-02-26 18:58:26 UTC <zoomer46> @USATODAY @DiamondLynne1 Of course.
968197771902767104 2018-02-26 18:55:11 UTC <zoomer46> @braden_rose @TheGoodGodAbove Another reality based observation from fearless leader.
968196437967364096 2018-02-26 18:49:53 UTC <zoomer46> @nmbr1hussy @DavidCornDC Just when you thought it couldnt get any dumber.
968195971187388417 2018-02-26 18:48:02 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo The old make my day fantasy.
968192983211364353 2018-02-26 18:36:10 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie Yes!
968191658893430789 2018-02-26 18:30:54 UTC <zoomer46> @POTUS @rayadae4 @selectedwisdom Oh boy.
968190911086723072 2018-02-26 18:27:55 UTC <zoomer46> @NRA @BeautyBind Nuns Run Amok.
968190382575181826 2018-02-26 18:25:49 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Well that settles it then.
967870713548955648 2018-02-25 21:15:34 UTC <zoomer46> @SafetyPinDaily How would you like to be mentioned with those losers?
967869546408366081 2018-02-25 21:10:56 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 you are not alone. everything is temporary.
967840325426470912 2018-02-25 19:14:49 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Ignorant racist cretin.
967839974841339904 2018-02-25 19:13:26 UTC <zoomer46> @sciencebetty Wow. What else can he rationalize?
967839415711227905 2018-02-25 19:11:12 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo They do.
967813678568476672 2018-02-25 17:28:56 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll Congrats!!!
967581796408938496 2018-02-24 02:07:31 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump This BS would really appeal to this putz.
967304980683206656 2018-02-23 07:47:33 UTC <zoomer46> @thehill That's a good idea.
967223644622639108 2018-02-23 02:24:21 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Once again arrogance and ignorance is a bad combination.
967218913057624065 2018-02-23 02:05:33 UTC <zoomer46> @perlmutations How messed up is that?
967189615655432193 2018-02-23 00:09:08 UTC <zoomer46> @LaineNola Oh boy.
967098373865132034 2018-02-23 18:06:34 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie Not the stupid snake poem again. It only appeals to the weak minded.
967093731680837632 2018-02-23 17:48:08 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 @krassenstein Its easy to rile up the mentally impaired.
967093051012341760 2018-02-23 17:45:25 UTC <zoomer46> @ReutersPolitics This is getting good.
966852131344044033 2018-02-22 01:48:06 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Doesnt he ever feel stupid?
966818768008761346 2018-02-22 23:35:31 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo I cant watch this fool.
966791433419153408 2018-02-22 21:46:54 UTC <zoomer46> @PinkBling2017 @RVAwonk I like it when LaPierre acts like a lunatic.
966746884118339584 2018-02-22 18:49:53 UTC <zoomer46> @kimmie8264 @nickiknowsnada These NRA owned politicians do not have the common good in mind and do not deserve our support.
966738710510362631 2018-02-22 18:17:24 UTC <zoomer46> @Trumpgot2go Yup. Thats about the size of it.
966705925963776000 2018-02-22 16:07:07 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Uh huh.
966651100840497152 2018-02-22 12:29:16 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic I cant think of much less appealing than confronting someone with an assault weapon with a handgun.
966466884202876928 2018-02-21 00:17:15 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @BrianPaulStuart You are a good judge of character.
966458753192202242 2018-02-21 23:44:57 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 If you unfollow me I am going to be pissed.
966457893775167488 2018-02-21 23:41:32 UTC <zoomer46> @Bjorkian15 @Amy_Siskind The one Trump accomplishment I could admire would be the unification of people with a conscience.
966456399961165824 2018-02-21 23:35:36 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc And the monkey rapped his tail around the flagpole...
966454787918229505 2018-02-21 23:29:11 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Great job. Pleasant working conditions. Low pay. Get to confront armed maniacs with low caliber handgun. Apply now.
966427890400325633 2018-02-21 21:42:19 UTC <zoomer46> @Bjorkian15 @sallyatticum Gee. Do you think this is a staged event? Turn it off. Everybody.
966425999616430080 2018-02-21 21:34:48 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo At least you won't get shot sitting in a classroom.
966423498079031301 2018-02-21 21:24:51 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 I am sure this will just insure that the sagging pants trend will be now a permanent thing. Kudos to South Carolina.
966382827263725569 2018-02-21 18:43:15 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @RexDouglasStock And a bottle of Tums.
966301098222018561 2018-02-21 13:18:29 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo well. there is probably nothing I can add to this.
966138768880226304 2018-02-20 02:33:27 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll Its not change that is hard. Its the resistance to change thats hard. Or something like that.
966137470718005250 2018-02-20 02:28:17 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll Why would I change? No problem here.
966073834976706560 2018-02-20 22:15:25 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JoyAnnReid All things come to those who wait. It's only a matter of time for the GOP demise.
966049601655537666 2018-02-20 20:39:08 UTC <zoomer46> @PressSec @Limeylizzie Which is unfortunate.
966049092890750978 2018-02-20 20:37:06 UTC <zoomer46> @PressSec @Limeylizzie I wonder if this is a new development or old behavior finally paying off for her.
966020082282483713 2018-02-20 18:41:50 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic This is so screwed up. To be represented by these...
966007359104585728 2018-02-20 17:51:16 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan I think they are perceived as easy prey. In this case they may have misjudged these Florida students. The young may save this country.
966006550702813184 2018-02-20 17:48:03 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan Misguided soul.
965981589816700928 2018-02-20 16:08:52 UTC <zoomer46> @bessbell @urmadz Oh Lord. I forgot about that.
965981059606372354 2018-02-20 16:06:46 UTC <zoomer46> @DougJones @evilyn1971 @reckonalabama Doug Jones speaking with force and clarity.
965980275598557184 2018-02-20 16:03:39 UTC <zoomer46> @urmadz @bessbell I wish Mitt came out swinging. I would feel better about this development then.
965977413229391872 2018-02-20 15:52:16 UTC <zoomer46> @TravelLeisure @TeamUSA @KristynBurtt @WSAZirr @JeffAdams82 @WVOutdoors @BradMcElhinny @JordanWVRadio @JennyMurrayV100 @bradhowe07 @weekley @ProducerCoop @WVMetroNews @KariVanHorn @heystevebishop that's just wrong.
965973072485462016 2018-02-20 15:35:02 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc And they will all be voting before too long.
965970866222829569 2018-02-20 15:26:16 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll They do love us so.
965969559000961026 2018-02-20 15:21:04 UTC <zoomer46> @DeadBunnyFrank @envisione Right off the cliff with the rest of the lemmings.
965968929498828802 2018-02-20 15:18:34 UTC <zoomer46> @DeadBunnyFrank @TrickFreee In retrospect, deplorable was not a bad word to use.
965700985401339905 2018-02-19 21:33:51 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie Being able to spell definitely is another one.
965689750303707136 2018-02-19 20:49:12 UTC <zoomer46> @TeaPainUSA Of course he does.
965689530819973121 2018-02-19 20:48:20 UTC <zoomer46> @fishbones313 @KoulaStoll Loyal beast.
965689292512268288 2018-02-19 20:47:23 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie Deal breaker.
965507589978120192 2018-02-19 08:45:22 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Of course. Overcompensating again.
965379514334437382 2018-02-18 00:16:26 UTC <zoomer46> @TheRynheart They ship you a mirror and you can kiss yourself.
965379214437486592 2018-02-18 00:15:15 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Youre kidding.
965351027506638853 2018-02-18 22:23:14 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll Protein!
965273688844263424 2018-02-18 17:15:55 UTC <zoomer46> @EnarDavis1 @jaketapper Uh huh.
965272668508512263 2018-02-18 17:11:52 UTC <zoomer46> @joeholbrook42 @nickiknowsnada @AJHWrites He has no sense of propriety.
965233073326522368 2018-02-18 14:34:32 UTC <zoomer46> @joeholbrook42 @nickiknowsnada Oh. He can go lower. There is no limit.
964160458960834560 2018-02-15 15:32:21 UTC <zoomer46> @hipchassis @HuffPost O. M. G.
964159719454793728 2018-02-15 15:29:24 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @co_rapunzel4 Here is Trump grandstanding for the gun enthusiasts at he expense of public safety which seems to be of no concern to him unless you are in the top one percent.
963891151303577605 2018-02-14 21:42:13 UTC <zoomer46> @lacasadesonia I think journalists should just stop going to the press conferences. I mean really. What's the point?
963836793945718786 2018-02-14 18:06:13 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie Hiring only the best of the best.
963829114472976384 2018-02-14 17:35:42 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc I admire your perseverance. You are much stronger than I am.
963589820835561475 2018-02-13 01:44:50 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 They still make Crisco?
963589584352432128 2018-02-13 01:43:54 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc Twitter can be so disturbing e sometimes.
963520773263675399 2018-02-13 21:10:28 UTC <zoomer46> @Cruellaisdevine I am very uncomfortable with hugging these days. I have morphed from just being plain uncomfortable with it.
963412318884417536 2018-02-13 13:59:30 UTC <zoomer46> @FoxNews @kilmeade @ainsleyearhardt @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends @Limeylizzie @BadFoxGraphics "By the books" might be over their heads.
962695476045807616 2018-02-11 14:31:02 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler Trump's natural ability to state lies as facts is quite remarkable.
962694436051410945 2018-02-11 14:26:54 UTC <zoomer46> @decole03 The total cost of the parade could finance care for quite a few Vets.
962692949506174976 2018-02-11 14:20:59 UTC <zoomer46> Interesting article.https://twitter.com/Brasilmagic/status/962691527423287298
962692262684692480 2018-02-11 14:18:16 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @EricHolder And do you see what I did here? I completely ignored the opioid crisis. It's going arou nd.
962688129814671360 2018-02-11 14:01:50 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @EricHolder It is not surprising that the Trump admin has done nothing to protect our electoral systems. The results of the last election probably guarantees inactivity in this regard.
962685794979893249 2018-02-11 13:52:34 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu @AynRandPaulRyan I stubbed my toe the other day. MF Obama.

962131675319885824 2018-02-09 01:10:41 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Here's a potential one-two punch. Mueller gets fired and a conflict with North Korea ensues. American sheep display Xenophobia and Trump soars in the polls forgetting about Mueller. Be forewarned. Do not let this happen
962130431125676032 2018-02-09 01:05:44 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @thehill Really. He is either lazy or illiterate.
962076883885133824 2018-02-09 21:32:58 UTC <zoomer46> @ToBeSafeNSound This administration acts as if they want an armed conflict.

961897738282635266 2018-02-09 09:41:06 UTC <zoomer46> @brando5112 @cindyrelish We really have to show up in ridiculous numbers to get the message across that we  as a nation are headed in the wrong direction.
961893593764986881 2018-02-09 09:24:38 UTC <zoomer46> @ThePlumLineGS Yes! I have been wondering how the Freedom Caucus escapes scrutiny in the MSM.

960632273514192896 2018-02-05 21:52:36 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @soledadobrien One can only assume that Trump does not subscribe the "let sleeping dogs lie" concept.
960171640008118273 2018-02-04 15:22:12 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll I think whether that happens or not will be key. If they have to blitz I think the Eagles are toast. Brady is good against the blitz.
960170901751857152 2018-02-04 15:19:16 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll I am interested to see if the Eagles defensive line can pressure Brady without the blitz.

959798372621275138 2018-02-03 14:38:58 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan @JoyAnnReid My guess is that all of a sudden the Trump administration will manage to blame this on Obama.
959796860201336832 2018-02-03 14:32:58 UTC <zoomer46> Conflict of interest does not seem to be a concern of the Trump administration.

953743299482877952 2018-01-17 21:38:16 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Stonekettle Racism is a pervading concept. Given the way I was raised, I find it is important to analyze my reactions often. I find that stereotypes and generalizations send up red flags for me.

948947705367355392 2018-01-04 16:02:18 UTC <zoomer46> @AltDayna @Stonekettle And I haven't seen Peewee Herman lately either...
948926666407104513 2018-01-04 14:38:42 UTC <zoomer46> @activist360 Don't cry for me, Argentina.
948906588517158912 2018-01-04 13:18:55 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @crazylary51 @howeasyweforget We have to show up in ridiculous numbers.
948904913844736000 2018-01-04 13:12:15 UTC <zoomer46> @crazylary51 @PuestoLoco I have to say that I am really getting some perverse pleasure out of this spectacle.

948874221849141248 2018-01-04 11:10:18 UTC <zoomer46> @SafetyPinDaily MY higher power does not get involved with details like this.
948693280740511744 2018-01-03 23:11:18 UTC <zoomer46> @KathyBagby1 @IChotiner You would think two orange guys would know each other.
948681721322659840 2018-01-03 22:25:22 UTC <zoomer46> I miss the Seinfeld references.
948628160396103683 2018-01-03 18:52:32 UTC <zoomer46> @carolynchris @funder Before he kills us all.
948624528439234565 2018-01-03 18:38:06 UTC <zoomer46> @JackHockett1 @christinawilkie wow.
948613226413088768 2018-01-03 17:53:12 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Whatever happened to What's your sign? or Do you come here often? or You look familiar or Am I going to get lucky tonight? You know, smooth stuff.
948368930636206080 2018-01-02 01:42:27 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc That's it. I couldn't put my finger on it. Craves sugar.
948363304476561408 2018-01-02 01:20:06 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc oh yes.
948363016914993153 2018-01-02 01:18:57 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump Have you taken leave of your senses, Sir.
948299557305188352 2018-01-02 21:06:47 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @Tecgale @nickiknowsnada I hardly know him.
948296729174134784 2018-01-02 20:55:33 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @mhmhart @DavidCornDC only logical.
948288841969958914 2018-01-02 20:24:12 UTC <zoomer46> @LunaLuvgood2017 @SallyQYates Clearly Trump does not understand that the judiciary branch is separate from the executive branch. I have a copy of the constitution. Maybe I should send it to him. Oh. I know. I'll get a case of them and send them to everyone at the WH.
948287826365419522 2018-01-02 20:20:10 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie The Lord will speak to her. I wish he'd speak to me sometime. I have some questions to ask.
948279930244292619 2018-01-02 19:48:48 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @TheRickWilson But when the bell rings the gate doesn't open.
948239628229861376 2018-01-02 17:08:39 UTC <zoomer46> @TheGoodGodAbove @EAKoyle @Lee_in_Iowa yes. I think she should wait for a sign...
948235403806601216 2018-01-02 16:51:52 UTC <zoomer46> @TeaPainUSA @Mainekindxl @PersuasivePR Bait and switch, long con, smoke and mirrors. You name it. Who knows what it is?
948196311945367558 2018-01-02 14:16:32 UTC <zoomer46> @EAKoyle @TrumpsareNazis Sometimes humor doesn't come across. This is humor. Right?
948194237593608197 2018-01-02 14:08:17 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo I's more like a closing of a letter.
948187917586960385 2018-01-02 13:43:10 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo My guess is that they will prosecute those around him but he will given a pass to his banishment.
948148323386523648 2018-01-02 11:05:50 UTC <zoomer46> @Pajjr2016 @mrossano6970 Such a strange man.
948143598628941824 2018-01-02 10:47:04 UTC <zoomer46> @cindyrelish The vicious dog is the poster child of today's political clashes, The dog, Trump, N Korea, health care, taxes, the parks, climate change the self-absorption. You name it. It's surreal.
947950040651354112 2018-01-01 21:57:56 UTC <zoomer46> @pattidan @ellle_em Who is going to tell him?
947949202293714944 2018-01-01 21:54:36 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @Limeylizzie @ColMorrisDavis Count your blessings. He is not signing executive orders down there.
947938549273374721 2018-01-01 21:12:16 UTC <zoomer46> @wordscout59 @Amy_Siskind We need a House majority and 2/3rds in the Senate. We can do this but we have to vote in remarkable numbers. Everyone has to vote. No excuses. Of course, some Republicans in the Senate will have to do the right thing as well.
947937269788405760 2018-01-01 21:07:11 UTC <zoomer46> @Michelle_888 @keith_pochick Another honest man. Kudos.

947934980214329344 2018-01-01 20:58:05 UTC <zoomer46> @RadioFreeTom @sheLLbeLL_xo It take an honest, courageous man...
947925057539657729 2018-01-01 20:18:39 UTC <zoomer46> @nancysquinn @PreetBharara Exactly.
947922583193837569 2018-01-01 20:08:50 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo whoa.
947916966056034305 2018-01-01 19:46:30 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Ours lives in a bag behind the couch.
947904019359518722 2018-01-01 18:55:04 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @fawfulfan It is obvious that the Senate Republicans are a collection of posers.
947858229513596928 2018-01-01 15:53:06 UTC <zoomer46> @SheriffClarke @NirodhaTW This whole thing is so disturbingly sad.

947782517754560514 2018-01-01 10:52:15 UTC <zoomer46> @ashhmonster I am going to try to be more positive and work toward solutions.
947624115468472327 2017-12-31 00:22:49 UTC <zoomer46> @randyprine @Mistress_Jan Disturbing.

947519493940621318 2017-12-31 17:27:06 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 @funder GOP. Read and weep.
947505397291679745 2017-12-31 16:31:05 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind What a despicable human being.
947505264147693569 2017-12-31 16:30:33 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 me too. but I am sick of holiday food. headed for the juicer

947129456690434048 2017-12-30 15:37:13 UTC <zoomer46> @20committee @sheLLbeLL_xo Nope. No estimates. Too risky.
947085698917699584 2017-12-30 12:43:21 UTC <zoomer46> @activist360 Is our president part of the problem or solution?

946819221157183490 2017-12-29 19:04:28 UTC <zoomer46> @slater_rose nope. no problem here.
946816852608667648 2017-12-29 18:55:03 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 There has to be a way to do both.
946792802771496960 2017-12-29 17:19:29 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Limeylizzie I get to go to bed whenever I want.
946762841180254209 2017-12-29 15:20:25 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Vote like your vote will tip the scale.
946759971135459328 2017-12-29 15:09:01 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Right back at you!
946739341547720704 2017-12-29 13:47:03 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @RoseMSerrano @ColMorrisDavis He missed the balance of powers class in High school.
946735305209638912 2017-12-29 13:31:00 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @TrevorBland7 @krassenstein It's not over YET.

946541714659053568 2017-12-28 00:41:45 UTC <zoomer46> @lesbianforlyfe I can't stand it.
946537701804781568 2017-12-28 00:25:48 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic There is a difference between weather and climate which is lost on the simple minded.
946488300801490945 2017-12-28 21:09:30 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind I am guessing old Roy will probably not ride off into the sunset but hang around and milk this publicity for as much as he can.
946484291625725984 2017-12-28 20:53:34 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 A fine example of attention to detail from our con man in chief.
946481845306363904 2017-12-28 20:43:51 UTC <zoomer46> @thehill @nevertrumptoo He looks good. Life has been treating him well.
946479478607437824 2017-12-28 20:34:27 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Yes. I can relate. The grandchildren just left.
946479031599403009 2017-12-28 20:32:40 UTC <zoomer46> @thehill @mrmetacrisis I believe you are correct.
946477973636558848 2017-12-28 20:28:28 UTC <zoomer46> @thehill Where is Rudolf Giuliani?
946464500923944960 2017-12-28 19:34:56 UTC <zoomer46> @Impolitics Shocking. People of all kinds of racial background are allowed to vote. And then they count them. Who knew elections worked like this. Oh Roy.
946460330556870657 2017-12-28 19:18:21 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @EdKrassen I usually do not retweet Trump's tweets but this is beyond belief. Is this a foreign policy statement? Can the USA be taken seriously with this sophomoric baffon in the WH? This is not just embarrassing but irresponsible and dangerous.
946445476534149120 2017-12-28 18:19:20 UTC <zoomer46> @pattidan @albamonica Vogue/Vanity Fair? This would be an insignificant detail to our POTUS who is not what you would call a detail guy.
946443972997713922 2017-12-28 18:13:21 UTC <zoomer46> @AngryRaccoon2 @sliver_of I think we went to different schools together.
946443522751827968 2017-12-28 18:11:34 UTC <zoomer46> @Wonkette @Pajjr2016 Those black people are so pesky when they insist on voting. Roy Moore, how do you live with yourself?
946416673535528960 2017-12-28 16:24:53 UTC <zoomer46> @RawStory Hacked election in Binomo? Love it.
946405136766730241 2017-12-28 15:39:02 UTC <zoomer46> @perlmutations Whoa.
946360043724836865 2017-12-28 12:39:51 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll It will keep us warm for 2 winters.

946189877309263872 2017-12-27 01:23:40 UTC <zoomer46> @matbo2 Well yes, Roy. That's the way it works. Everybody gets to vote and then you count them.
946060145246855169 2017-12-27 16:48:10 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic After he licked someone elses boots.
946046715546750976 2017-12-27 15:54:48 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Did he get a receipt and his current balance too?
946014261934948352 2017-12-27 13:45:50 UTC <zoomer46> @bming5 I believe there will be an election
946007739435712512 2017-12-27 13:19:55 UTC <zoomer46> @limitlesskait @BillKristol Mentioning Churchill and our president in the same paragraph displays an unusual ignorance of history for a person in the public arena. On second though, from anyone.
946005784344883201 2017-12-27 13:12:09 UTC <zoomer46> @bming5 @Brasilmagic Apparently the Trump administration does not feel that the rule of law applies to them. The election in November is sooner than they think. It is time to send a clear strong message.
945998169657274368 2017-12-27 12:41:54 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Does that count.
945770880528998400 2017-12-26 21:38:44 UTC <zoomer46> @PinkBling2017 Yup
945729868528054272 2017-12-26 18:55:46 UTC <zoomer46> @MikeHudema @TrevorBland7 Good point.

945719653753675776 2017-12-26 18:15:10 UTC <zoomer46> @DeepStateFan @Stonekettle I like to ask a very personal question. Usually fold like a cheap suit.
945374429642739717 2017-12-25 19:23:22 UTC <zoomer46> @JohnLyonTweets @Parkerlawyer Yes. It is.
945362721498980352 2017-12-25 18:36:51 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Again. Whaaaat? I seem to saying that a lot lately
945329542633263104 2017-12-25 16:25:00 UTC <zoomer46> @Stonekettle It's a conspiracy of stupidity.
945329124519837697 2017-12-25 16:23:21 UTC <zoomer46> @Stonekettle Yes. I actually think he invented Christmas. It's a little known fact that Trump was the Messiah. Believe me.
945272504943247361 2017-12-25 12:38:22 UTC <zoomer46> PEACE on EARTH.
945101126185209858 2017-12-24 01:17:22 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo umm. I like it but whaaat?
945085573043228672 2017-12-24 00:15:34 UTC <zoomer46> @CathyJoeGPT @RedTRaccoon It's Santa in his Happy Holidays sleigh.

944918732991815680 2017-12-24 13:12:36 UTC <zoomer46> @larrydavid @Brasilmagic I wonder how @LarryDavid feels about this. I wish he would weigh in.
944917678841528320 2017-12-24 13:08:25 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic LET the airing of grievances commence!

944663236795912192 2017-12-23 20:17:21 UTC <zoomer46> @acejordan23 Time to air our grievances.
944655907056701440 2017-12-23 19:48:13 UTC <zoomer46> @Amerikabeau2 You are welcome. Thank you too.

944594562902904832 2017-12-23 15:44:28 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic @SundayDiana In the meantime you could just type "puke button" as it has a nice ring to it.
944592967549014016 2017-12-23 15:38:07 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @soledadobrien I made up my mind not to be surprised that I am surprised. My family taught me this.
944592566275756032 2017-12-23 15:36:32 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @robreiner Trump is going down one way or the other. If DOJ doesn't do it, the electorate will. We have to turn out in astounding numbers though.
944591381321969664 2017-12-23 15:31:49 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic I really like the vomiting imogi.
944589003466182657 2017-12-23 15:22:22 UTC <zoomer46> @SethAbramson He will love being the center of attention. They won't be able to shut him up.
944570188825092097 2017-12-23 14:07:36 UTC <zoomer46> @colleengrott Hey. That's me!
944569228237197314 2017-12-23 14:03:47 UTC <zoomer46> @KamalaHarris Good idea.
944567799934017536 2017-12-23 13:58:07 UTC <zoomer46> What. No parade?
944566311077793792 2017-12-23 13:52:12 UTC <zoomer46> @a_fly_guy @bamboojohn He probably had trouble with Logic.
944553864967151616 2017-12-23 13:02:45 UTC <zoomer46> @tbbucsbabe @soledadobrien He should show some initiative and just go over and mow it.
944552897504862209 2017-12-23 12:58:54 UTC <zoomer46> @cindyrelish I believe we can take control of both Houses on the Hill in November but we have to show up in astounding numbers. This country is full of kind wonderful people who just need a chance to be heard. Thanks for the positive message.
944549680335196165 2017-12-23 12:46:07 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind Merry Christmas to you too!
944530818323697664 2017-12-23 11:31:10 UTC <zoomer46> @BodhisattvaKat @docrocktex26 The midterms are coming. We have to vote in astonishing numbers.
944527807924899840 2017-12-23 11:19:12 UTC <zoomer46> @StolenSceptre That's "Reach across the Aisle" Mitch.
944377832846823424 2017-12-22 01:23:15 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Alternate reality.
944377131403968512 2017-12-22 01:20:28 UTC <zoomer46> @shiggybythebay ok. I'll call off the search teams.
944355119222722560 2017-12-22 23:53:00 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Something very weird is going on.
944352523707613184 2017-12-22 23:42:41 UTC <zoomer46> @KaniJJackson He's a tacky person.
944336401428074496 2017-12-22 22:38:37 UTC <zoomer46> @InvPac Ooh. Fire up the Weber.
944335427590344704 2017-12-22 22:34:45 UTC <zoomer46> @jomareewade @Kris_Sacrebleu In due time...
944333436248051712 2017-12-22 22:26:50 UTC <zoomer46> @Trumptweets2020 You reap what you sow.
944329950936563713 2017-12-22 22:12:59 UTC <zoomer46> @mike_Zollo @FactsVsOpinion Good point.
944325013313908736 2017-12-22 21:53:22 UTC <zoomer46> @barrymanilow Nice.
944315761505468416 2017-12-22 21:16:36 UTC <zoomer46> Well done, @co_rapunzel4. Kudos. Screw the bot.
944293864826900480 2017-12-22 19:49:36 UTC <zoomer46> @Minervasbard @DavidYankovich I had a cowboy outfit when I was a kid. Hat, six guns, chaps, vest. the real deal. No cattle though.
944292795799560192 2017-12-22 19:45:21 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic I am not sure but I don't think he likes black people all that much.
944260507070025729 2017-12-22 17:37:03 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 works for me. well. more like 30.
944259557949431808 2017-12-22 17:33:16 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 maybe it's 40 lbs per ft.
944257395546644481 2017-12-22 17:24:41 UTC <zoomer46> @shiggybythebay If you are not back in a few days we will send help.
944257139941441536 2017-12-22 17:23:40 UTC <zoomer46> @nikkihaley @mitchellreports @margaritateresa I guess it doesn't matter why.
944256752127705089 2017-12-22 17:22:07 UTC <zoomer46> @andeenickee @tribelaw I can't watch that disgusting show of... what. Cowardice.
944256057911791616 2017-12-22 17:19:22 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind Flannel mouth liars being interviewed by people on the take.
944255758027427841 2017-12-22 17:18:10 UTC <zoomer46> @Maplelle21 Whatever your heart desires.. Happy Birthday.
944255436890484736 2017-12-22 17:16:54 UTC <zoomer46> @PaulEalyMooney God, yes.
944255254702579717 2017-12-22 17:16:10 UTC <zoomer46> @JRubinBlogger Ivanka is just like her father. They both just run their mouth to see what comes out.
944253002063470593 2017-12-22 17:07:13 UTC <zoomer46> @buffaloon @JoyAnnReid I'd like to be at the Pearly Gates when she arrives.
944252644901707776 2017-12-22 17:05:48 UTC <zoomer46> @VA4Hillary1 @funder This sounds like hell on earth to me.
944252294329233409 2017-12-22 17:04:24 UTC <zoomer46> @nikkihaley @margaritateresa @mitchellreports Makes you wonder what happened to this guy. I mean was he dropped on his head or locked in a closet or left on a wintry slope to die. Really. How does one turn out this way?
944243549834502144 2017-12-22 16:29:40 UTC <zoomer46> @stirstyx @nowthisnews I am going to watch this every day until November.
944239909413548033 2017-12-22 16:15:12 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic @shiggybythebay Nope.
944239078400290818 2017-12-22 16:11:54 UTC <zoomer46> @shiggybythebay @Brasilmagic I thought is was a joke. That's amazing.
944234366640717824 2017-12-22 15:53:10 UTC <zoomer46> @barry_corindia You're kidding me.
944233587133607936 2017-12-22 15:50:04 UTC <zoomer46> @EnarDavis1 @JoyAnnReid Sean is not exactly inspirationally intelligent. I think he's dim and easily manipulated.
944232871207821313 2017-12-22 15:47:14 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 smiling.
944232170993963008 2017-12-22 15:44:27 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 I think it must be a sign from God.
944225754623238146 2017-12-22 15:18:57 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 @RepAdamSchiff Remember this photograph in November.
944220955022381056 2017-12-22 14:59:53 UTC <zoomer46> @QuoththeRaven2 @HarryPotterMAGE Good point. At least they were allies.
944181041371209728 2017-12-22 12:21:16 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @RVAwonk Go figure. NY real estate, casinos? What a surprise.
944167654679633920 2017-12-22 11:28:05 UTC <zoomer46> @ananavarro I can't watch.
944163991546486784 2017-12-22 11:13:31 UTC <zoomer46> @QuoththeRaven2 @HarryPotterMAGE A fine example of not understanding your adversaries.
944163064689065984 2017-12-22 11:09:50 UTC <zoomer46> @Anony_Mia @williamlegate oh boy.
944140539976388608 2017-12-22 09:40:20 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 nope.
944139960311058433 2017-12-22 09:38:02 UTC <zoomer46> @LeeLuvYoga I thought I was the only one.
944135384207937536 2017-12-22 09:19:51 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 @SouRgrapeS417 You are sleeepy. Very sleeepy.
944020384579497986 2017-12-21 01:42:53 UTC <zoomer46> @sliver_of YES.
944017616527659013 2017-12-21 01:31:53 UTC <zoomer46> @mbuchan40 @funder The best parade would be to escort him out of town.
944017317419208704 2017-12-21 01:30:42 UTC <zoomer46> @Crash2411 Have you all gone completely mad? Have you no sense of decency, sir?
943962944852946945 2017-12-21 21:54:38 UTC <zoomer46> @MauraLeeLang @abutler04 It's tempting to laugh this off but I did that with Trump and look where that got us.
943939433690206215 2017-12-21 20:21:13 UTC <zoomer46> @Shareblue @margaritateresa @owillis Why am I not surprised that Ivanka doesn't know what she is talking about? There musty be something in the water at the WH. It seems to be the trend.
943659442947715073 2017-12-20 01:48:38 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JakeSherman Oh boy. I have had enough fun and frivolity and going to call it aa day.
943628738188795904 2017-12-20 23:46:37 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 oh
943628315709116417 2017-12-20 23:44:56 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 you need thishttps://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-portable-charger-cobalt-blue/4212601.p?skuId=4212601&ref=212&loc=1&ksid=995c144f-d8e5-45d9-842f-42605935a3c2&ksprof_id=10&ksaffcode=pg129214&ksdevice=c&lsft=ref:212,loc:2
943611272263864320 2017-12-20 22:37:13 UTC <zoomer46> @filbertius @margaritateresa I think anger is way better than despair. The midterms are coming. Don't forget this day.
943274046233464833 2017-12-19 00:17:12 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 pick your nose. that usually deters advances.
943271373207633920 2017-12-19 00:06:35 UTC <zoomer46> @GOP @LauraLAbythesea @EdithNourse Remember this photograph in November.
943220776429289475 2017-12-19 20:45:31 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan There is an ass for every seat.
943126525683163136 2017-12-19 14:31:00 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Probably not today.
943124649902313472 2017-12-19 14:23:33 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind I think we should all have Nerf bats.
943124355336241152 2017-12-19 14:22:23 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu As well they should.
942876586281496576 2017-12-18 21:57:50 UTC <zoomer46> @nikkihaley @DGB_JAIID That about nails it.
942875999926091776 2017-12-18 21:55:30 UTC <zoomer46> @nikkihaley @DGB_JAIID Not going there.
942875362664599552 2017-12-18 21:52:58 UTC <zoomer46> @nikkihaley @DGB_JAIID All of the above but you are missing something.
942873469649289216 2017-12-18 21:45:27 UTC <zoomer46> @nikkihaley @DGB_JAIID The whole concept is driven by a president who displays a classic overcompensation syndrome.
942790957212360704 2017-12-18 16:17:35 UTC <zoomer46> @buffaloon @RobbieResister Oh yes.
942786496498749441 2017-12-18 15:59:51 UTC <zoomer46> @krassenstein @SelfImposedXile Probably.
942780181437181952 2017-12-18 15:34:45 UTC <zoomer46> @krassenstein I hope Mueller has a plan B.
942750188871004161 2017-12-18 13:35:35 UTC <zoomer46> @nadianboone @Brasilmagic Yes and I am the walrus.
942749637940834305 2017-12-18 13:33:23 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic @kitkatmckey You could be on to something. Greed and power are tremendous forces.
942741174669934592 2017-12-18 12:59:45 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic @kitkatmckey Her "honor" is probably on the payroll. Or arrogant and stupid.
942739325153955840 2017-12-18 12:52:25 UTC <zoomer46> @cattleranch1 @BetteMidler I blame it on my mother.
942571592319754243 2017-12-17 01:45:54 UTC <zoomer46> @mialynneb Two perfect assholes.
942565016661843969 2017-12-17 01:19:46 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind @kylegriffin1 The grifters strike again.
942511752977231872 2017-12-17 21:48:07 UTC <zoomer46> Get your photo id now and make sure you are registered to vote. Do not wait until election day.
942383645326757888 2017-12-17 13:19:04 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @samstein *for. but I actually like foe here.
942381758292680705 2017-12-17 13:11:34 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 I have my moments
942380679492497411 2017-12-17 13:07:17 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Yes, while abroad.
942348869681254400 2017-12-17 11:00:53 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 The DC political environment is very much like the town portrayed in the George Bailey jumps off the bridge scenario.
942347067820793856 2017-12-17 10:53:43 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @samstein This mob needs a few good lawyers who know the ropes in DC. I hear "what's a court room" Petersen may be looking foe employment.
942154956454481920 2017-12-16 22:10:20 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Isn't there another pool or a beach? Or how about some shoe polish on the door knob.
942153131013689345 2017-12-16 22:03:05 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 They are not happy. They do not know the meaning of life. My guess is that their cars don't rust.
942118319255113729 2017-12-16 19:44:45 UTC <zoomer46> @krassenstein General strike. Shut the country down.
942089622586314753 2017-12-16 17:50:43 UTC <zoomer46> @HowardCohen @FactsVsOpinion @MiamiHerald I feel so much safer now.
942052558440366080 2017-12-16 15:23:27 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 There is always the sock drawer.
942046215042207749 2017-12-16 14:58:14 UTC <zoomer46> @MitchEPerry @AGPamBondi @evilyn1971 @PeterSchorschFL Does Pam Bondi think the Watergate  didn't break-in did not happen and shouldn't have been investigated?
942045188842770432 2017-12-16 14:54:10 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Whoa.
942043536685522944 2017-12-16 14:47:36 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo I hope he runs for something and suffers a humiliating defeat. That would be real entertainment.
942042598960705536 2017-12-16 14:43:52 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 It was out for about an hour this morning so we had a party.
942041079527985154 2017-12-16 14:37:50 UTC <zoomer46> @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @BeChangeToday @hikergal333 Rubbish.
942029633670787072 2017-12-16 13:52:21 UTC <zoomer46> @PinkBling2017 I have to wonder if that is what some of them are thinking.  It sure makes me wonder but I wonder about a lot of things.
942028824904167424 2017-12-16 13:49:08 UTC <zoomer46> @PinkBling2017 @AnnieLowrey Take the money and run. Who cares if we win in November?
941981846459600896 2017-12-16 10:42:28 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien This is cringeworthy.
941979368372436992 2017-12-16 10:32:37 UTC <zoomer46> @TheRickWilson Funny.
941978839655346176 2017-12-16 10:30:31 UTC <zoomer46> @braden_rose @Bakari_Sellers Such an off the cuff answer on a very important issue. Is it inconceivable to just say no comment?
941976138590703621 2017-12-16 10:19:47 UTC <zoomer46> @TattyBonce @owillis This is such a strange occurrence. I do not believe it is a coincidence and therefore belies an incredible callousness. Is it too much to ask for a display of sympathy here? I suppose empathy is just out of the question then.
941972389490982917 2017-12-16 10:04:53 UTC <zoomer46> @voxdotcom This confirms what I had suspected all along. The article suggests that "having a 10-minute, nonconfrontational conversation" with a sexist or racist can result in a positive change. Given the polarization now, this could be difficult to do but not impossible.
941782619712311297 2017-12-15 21:30:48 UTC <zoomer46> @Oooooo_Donna @TarynStanford @TammyLynne89 @LsExaminedLife @co_rapunzel4 @CharismaMolotov @isa_m_ferreira @Gallaecian @donna_Siciliana @csu_scientist @cindyrelish @SelfImposedXile Agreed. The electoral turnout has to remarkable to gain seats in the House and the Senate. There is real work to be done before the midterms in 12018.
941781625561632768 2017-12-15 21:26:51 UTC <zoomer46> @LauraLAbythesea @waltshaub If Trump fires Mueller he must be impeached. This is an impeachable offence.
941780142829064192 2017-12-15 21:20:58 UTC <zoomer46> @SelfImposedXile @Oooooo_Donna @TarynStanford @TammyLynne89 @LsExaminedLife @co_rapunzel4 @CharismaMolotov @isa_m_ferreira @Gallaecian @donna_Siciliana @csu_scientist @cindyrelish Take heart. The midterms are coming.
941775616902422529 2017-12-15 21:02:59 UTC <zoomer46> @comeonnoles @KenJennings Yes. Join a group. Volunteer. Mingle.
941771518987599877 2017-12-15 20:46:42 UTC <zoomer46> @NormEisen Don't they have any lawyers to consult? W.T.F.
941763800168124416 2017-12-15 20:16:01 UTC <zoomer46> @cindyrelish I think I invented the power nap in October 1959.
941762688258052097 2017-12-15 20:11:36 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc We are supposed to get just a dusting which is fine by me.
941758412949467136 2017-12-15 19:54:37 UTC <zoomer46> If it weren't so literal it could be considered symbolic. On second thought why not? Symbolic.
941757753328009218 2017-12-15 19:52:00 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @thehill Here is another charmer who is getting exactly what he deserves. This guy is a perfect storm; arrogance and ignorance.

939680060671451137 2017-12-09 02:15:59 UTC <zoomer46> @Currtis25Harr this I will never understand.
939627728281722881 2017-12-09 22:48:02 UTC <zoomer46> @TheAlexNevil @TrueTorontoGirl i hate when the eyebrows aren't there in the morning.
939617513427611648 2017-12-09 22:07:27 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic holy smokes. talk about ignorance.
939529896350699520 2017-12-09 16:19:17 UTC <zoomer46> @pattidan @Stonekettle Trump is a lying SOS.
939529583954681857 2017-12-09 16:18:03 UTC <zoomer46> @nadianboone very sweet.
939528476482326528 2017-12-09 16:13:39 UTC <zoomer46> all hat no cattle.
939528185523339264 2017-12-09 16:12:29 UTC <zoomer46> @GutterTrash76 you don't charge enough.
939527678474051584 2017-12-09 16:10:28 UTC <zoomer46> @GutterTrash76 time for the advice booth.
939519072324202496 2017-12-09 15:36:16 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind Trump is getting like a cornered animal.
939517948338884608 2017-12-09 15:31:48 UTC <zoomer46> @hermitme1 @RedTRaccoon God. I hope so.
939517675025453056 2017-12-09 15:30:43 UTC <zoomer46> @shondi99 @BanditRandom this is extremely f&%ked up.
939517220119547905 2017-12-09 15:28:55 UTC <zoomer46> @PinkBling2017 what state are you in?
939514849775751168 2017-12-09 15:19:30 UTC <zoomer46> I thought i saw a hunter in the woods behind my next door neighbor's house. I was off and running. My wife said she heard a shot when I was out and well you know...so the next day I went down to take a look and it was a spent pumpkin not an orange hunting jacket. Relieved.
939509666056409088 2017-12-09 14:58:54 UTC <zoomer46> @PinkBling2017 we have to show up at the polls in unprecedented numbers. They cannot beat that scenario no matter what they do. they win when the dems don't show up.
939508526451445761 2017-12-09 14:54:22 UTC <zoomer46> @PinkBling2017 if there isn't a remarkable democratic landslide in 2018 i think we may be forever screwed.
939506711035088897 2017-12-09 14:47:09 UTC <zoomer46> @PinkBling2017 You got me but it looks like they might do it.
939503271802261510 2017-12-09 14:33:29 UTC <zoomer46> @PinkBling2017 @SaysHummingbird @anrimaca100 I am not optimistic about Alabama but I am very hopeful about the midterms in 2018.
939501412270202882 2017-12-09 14:26:06 UTC <zoomer46> @bimmerella That's their stance on any issue. Seems like "It's okay if it happens to them." should be the GOP's motto.
939500378890166272 2017-12-09 14:22:00 UTC <zoomer46> @RepAlGreen @AlexWitt Seems like he only likes white people and not all of THEM.
939500128930615299 2017-12-09 14:21:00 UTC <zoomer46> @PinkBling2017 @SaysHummingbird We have to get the majority in both Houses in order for anything to happen.
939499774180560896 2017-12-09 14:19:35 UTC <zoomer46> @cindyrelish They want to go back to the pre New Deal America and that's a fact. Used to be pre Great Society America but they are frighteningly emboldened.
939498195616522242 2017-12-09 14:13:19 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind The f%$k's a matter with that moron?
939283415110770689 2017-12-08 23:59:51 UTC <zoomer46> @SocialPowerOne1 How can Hannity live with himself?
939260453787701253 2017-12-08 22:28:37 UTC <zoomer46> @shellyhawthorne @goldengateblond looks good on you.
939259199544061952 2017-12-08 22:23:38 UTC <zoomer46> @2havefun72 @peterdaou They should have it piped straight to their homes then.
939256729988227072 2017-12-08 22:13:49 UTC <zoomer46> @thewayoftheid W. T. F. is wrong with these people?
939254882292428800 2017-12-08 22:06:29 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 @UnFitz yes sleep. it will be the downfall of the universe.
939254180988022785 2017-12-08 22:03:41 UTC <zoomer46> @usatopinion @USATODAY @msmithobx @kurtbardella if it weren't so scary and sad i would be happy for you. dark days indeed.
939246987291103233 2017-12-08 21:35:06 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan Uh huh.
939246549338554368 2017-12-08 21:33:22 UTC <zoomer46> @PolitikMasFina They are not part of my family any more.
939245347108544513 2017-12-08 21:28:35 UTC <zoomer46> @krassenstein We need to vote in unprecedented numbers. The very existence of the Republic is at stake.
939111262830710784 2017-12-08 12:35:47 UTC <zoomer46> @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @hikergal333 Good idea. The notion of shaming the Republicans probably won't work. They seem to know no shame.
939105817214832640 2017-12-08 12:14:09 UTC <zoomer46> @2017Gamora I suspect Giuliani folded like a cheap suit.
938899262171222016 2017-12-07 22:33:22 UTC <zoomer46> Get some sleep. Eat some vegetables. Did lots of water. Get some fresh air.
938880501397549056 2017-12-07 21:18:49 UTC <zoomer46> @SnizzleFrizzle Hey what are you driving these days? Did you make good time? Did you take the bridge. Do you like that car? We're done. Now what.
938873489104261120 2017-12-07 20:50:57 UTC <zoomer46> @Minervasbard I never know which one to look at.
938728373051895809 2017-12-07 11:14:19 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Dont forget the Wonder bread.
938703612993302528 2017-12-07 09:35:56 UTC <zoomer46> @CheriJacobus The midterms are coming. The midterms are coming!
938553543153340418 2017-12-06 23:39:36 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Apparently needs sixty votes in the Senate. Not going to happen.
938545922212007936 2017-12-06 23:09:19 UTC <zoomer46> @JRubinBlogger Desperate people do desperate things. If this is indeed a person.
938545266172596224 2017-12-06 23:06:43 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Hmm. Well. I for one am happy to follow you.
938543333609177088 2017-12-06 22:59:02 UTC <zoomer46> @ashhmonster Wish I had some.
938539310890082306 2017-12-06 22:43:03 UTC <zoomer46> @hermitme1 @JohnFugelsang I have also thought this but will he given that Congress may not have the spine to impeach. If he thought he was to be impeached that would be a different story. We shall see.
938537048587276288 2017-12-06 22:34:04 UTC <zoomer46> @un_belizable @CNN Hope he wins.
938535849557360641 2017-12-06 22:29:18 UTC <zoomer46> @cindyrelish They really dont.
938516306101460993 2017-12-06 21:11:38 UTC <zoomer46> Sending a case of Polident to the WH to secure my appointment to the Supreme Court.
938515717120512000 2017-12-06 21:09:18 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu maybe its his false teeth.
938509600185372672 2017-12-06 20:45:00 UTC <zoomer46> @justabadazz I believe you are correct. I was there in Washington when we invaded Cambodia. I saw the buses parked as barricades in front of the WH. The Republicans are out of touch and need to see action.
938508308536754176 2017-12-06 20:39:52 UTC <zoomer46> @aliasvaughn good news for a change.
938507613293170690 2017-12-06 20:37:06 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 breathe deeply and stay in the moment as much as you can. we will eventually prevail.
938507346820681728 2017-12-06 20:36:02 UTC <zoomer46> i think this a classic example of overcompensating.
938496915842457606 2017-12-06 19:54:35 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Hope he keeps in touch. Think theyll let him keep his phone?
938464662471036932 2017-12-06 17:46:26 UTC <zoomer46> @dbarcon Wow
938462971214393345 2017-12-06 17:39:42 UTC <zoomer46> @SmallOnez8778 @sheLLbeLL_xo Whoa
938352105995333632 2017-12-06 10:19:10 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 It really is amazing.
938224877001236481 2017-12-05 01:53:36 UTC <zoomer46> @SnizzleFrizzle @shopkins776 I had a German shepherd who would watch you throw the ball and then look at you as if to say what did you do that for? God I loved that dog.
938223540045860864 2017-12-05 01:48:17 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo You like to live dangerously.
938217287106154497 2017-12-05 01:23:27 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu thanks. i needed that.
938193434711650307 2017-12-05 23:48:40 UTC <zoomer46> @GOP @PRyan @SenMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC @Eurotrash67 actually. I have been informed that this quote is incorrect. I checked it out on Snopes. https://www.snopes.com/1998-trump-people-quote/.
938191531198025728 2017-12-05 23:41:06 UTC <zoomer46> @GOP @PRyan @SenMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC @Eurotrash67 @HippieBikers https://www.snopes.com/1998-trump-people-quote/ you are correct. thanks.
938186794021085184 2017-12-05 23:22:17 UTC <zoomer46> And there are no brains under those hats either.
938176628278120448 2017-12-05 22:41:53 UTC <zoomer46> @msfabu @BanditRandom The crazy thing is that many people think this all is logical and that makes me wonder.
938175644999004161 2017-12-05 22:37:58 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan Trump is displaying classic play ground bully behavior with his Jerusalem decision. It makes no sense.
938151731245940736 2017-12-05 21:02:57 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien Ah. The bar goes even lower.
938135763123924992 2017-12-05 19:59:30 UTC <zoomer46> @ziwe The thought occurs to me that you may not know what a noogie is. In case you don't it is the harsh knuckle to the top of the head.
938134548415746049 2017-12-05 19:54:40 UTC <zoomer46> @ziwe Give him a noogie.
938131934110199810 2017-12-05 19:44:17 UTC <zoomer46> @Of_By_ForPeople @cindyrelish I totally get this.
938130207415955456 2017-12-05 19:37:25 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan This is just asking for it.
938129687792013315 2017-12-05 19:35:21 UTC <zoomer46> @PromoteMyCause Oh my. Rolling around.
938128829801025537 2017-12-05 19:31:57 UTC <zoomer46> @girlsreallyrule Russian image problem gets worse.
938128577459081235 2017-12-05 19:30:57 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Oh boy.
938127954915229696 2017-12-05 19:28:28 UTC <zoomer46> @basicwhiteM0m @Amy_Siskind Someone better check the basement.
938127132718436354 2017-12-05 19:25:12 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo I can see this.
938123228068884481 2017-12-05 19:09:41 UTC <zoomer46> @LokiLoptr @OliviaResists @exoticgamora @Q_JUST_Q @CherylHoney5thW @AmyPondResists @SlythSeeker2017 @romanticskeptc @2017Gamora I feel that way.
938121015976218624 2017-12-05 19:00:54 UTC <zoomer46> @SethAbramson See what we have to look forward to?
938103332480192512 2017-12-05 17:50:38 UTC <zoomer46> @cindyrelish Trump will not go there alone.
938100257887580160 2017-12-05 17:38:25 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Holy smokes.
938090725094379520 2017-12-05 17:00:32 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX I was trying to be supportive. Perhaps I better work on my delivery. Sorry.
938009855876653056 2017-12-05 11:39:11 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX Hope you know I was being sarcastic.
937993730027606016 2017-12-05 10:35:06 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX Such nice people.
937993640944852997 2017-12-05 10:34:45 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX Doesnt it just warm your heart?
937987731245993985 2017-12-05 10:11:16 UTC <zoomer46> @CNNPolitics @RWPUSA Catch 22.
937987298712530944 2017-12-05 10:09:33 UTC <zoomer46> @fawfulfan Pathetic.
937810449529262082 2017-12-04 22:26:49 UTC <zoomer46> @trabash3RR Arrogant fool.
937810271489478659 2017-12-04 22:26:07 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu Tut tut.
937776155469533192 2017-12-04 20:10:33 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind I have avoided republicans all my life. Every once in awhile I have been coerced to be in the same room but I didn't like it.
937760934721998848 2017-12-04 19:10:04 UTC <zoomer46> it's only a matter of time if the Nazis have their way.https://twitter.com/historylvrsclub/status/937760185615085568
937758429460025345 2017-12-04 19:00:06 UTC <zoomer46> Perhaps Trump's lawyer is setting the scene for the firing of Mueller.https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/937757899656433664
937755353449730048 2017-12-04 18:47:53 UTC <zoomer46> @Minervasbard @FireZMissiles Wow. What a shame.
937754942319755264 2017-12-04 18:46:15 UTC <zoomer46> @bammersacat You wont catch me doing that either.
937754546704707584 2017-12-04 18:44:41 UTC <zoomer46> @bammersacat Well. I hope you are carrying your end of the conversation.
937753823375970305 2017-12-04 18:41:48 UTC <zoomer46> @cattleranch1 He. YES. I KNEW it.
937753301403291649 2017-12-04 18:39:44 UTC <zoomer46> @EAKoyle Thats a terrific idea. Pure genius.
937629135236730880 2017-12-04 10:26:20 UTC <zoomer46> @krassenstein If Trump fires Mueller what happens next?
937614644604297217 2017-12-04 09:28:45 UTC <zoomer46> @CHEFFY_1969 Go Tobe.
937473828757950467 2017-12-03 00:09:12 UTC <zoomer46> @GutterTrash76 Yay
937464404509122561 2017-12-03 23:31:45 UTC <zoomer46> @JohnJHarwood This the mindset of the trash we have running the country.
937453236285595649 2017-12-03 22:47:23 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 @MysteriousOnesi Want some permanent house guests?
937452240796897281 2017-12-03 22:43:25 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Moth ball aroma did it for me once.
937451843659227136 2017-12-03 22:41:51 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 @AbbyHasIssues Someone mentioned xanax licks in every room today. I think CVS has them.
937451404880379906 2017-12-03 22:40:06 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 @MysteriousOnesi People who are cruel to animals lack the ability to feel empathy among other things. Why? I don't know.
937432441161158661 2017-12-03 21:24:45 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @PolitikMasFina We have to come out and vote in astounding numbers. None of us can now have an excuse not to vote. November is closer than we think.
937429002574270464 2017-12-03 21:11:05 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler Admin getting it from all sides. Couldnt happen to a nicer teeming nest of pariahs.
937427903985397760 2017-12-03 21:06:43 UTC <zoomer46> @Alt_FedEmployee @NaggingNurse At that time I will break out in the Snoopy Dance.
937426738501619712 2017-12-03 21:02:05 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @EnarDavis1 What happened in military school?
937424863760977920 2017-12-03 20:54:38 UTC <zoomer46> @shondi99 @RVAwonk Really stepped in it that time.
937420121554821120 2017-12-03 20:35:48 UTC <zoomer46> @awkwardlyours Unless you tricked someone into thinking that it was their idea.
937411144523898880 2017-12-03 20:00:07 UTC <zoomer46> Most of them shoot blanks
937404430160416768 2017-12-03 19:33:26 UTC <zoomer46> @2havefun72 @lhfang How do people turn out this way? I really want to know.
937403817678778369 2017-12-03 19:31:00 UTC <zoomer46> @ShelbyKentStewa The GOP really has shown their true colors.
937403359325249536 2017-12-03 19:29:11 UTC <zoomer46> @dcexaminer @Ez4u2say_Janis This is a classic Obama understatement. How I miss this man.
937400483672715264 2017-12-03 19:17:46 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis @Scott_Gilmore Is deranged the new normal?
937388639411154944 2017-12-03 18:30:42 UTC <zoomer46> Nope
937384516058079232 2017-12-03 18:14:19 UTC <zoomer46> @ABC @danicalynn1988 I have noticed this but didnt know it had other significance.
937375825518911489 2017-12-03 17:39:47 UTC <zoomer46> Na. Not even close.
937375604416176132 2017-12-03 17:38:54 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler You know what's different? There were a few politicians who came forward and asked him to step down. Republicans. Would it happen today?

937374441318776834 2017-12-03 17:34:17 UTC <zoomer46> @OrrinHatch @BeautyBind Lord I do not like that guy.
937373910571651072 2017-12-03 17:32:10 UTC <zoomer46> @hermitme1 @SethAbramson Thanks, Seth.
937372972792406016 2017-12-03 17:28:26 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo He should hit the salad bar.
937372586060763136 2017-12-03 17:26:54 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Merry Christmas
937372177363554304 2017-12-03 17:25:17 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @Deecat101 @grantstern All things come to those who wait.
937365318955163653 2017-12-03 16:58:02 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind Hear. Hear.
937329251086471169 2017-12-03 14:34:42 UTC <zoomer46> @senorrinhatch @JoeNBC @KatherineEban These fuckers are history in 2018.
937288192419606529 2017-12-03 11:51:33 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 @Cpin42 Quick. There has to be somewhere else.
937287954497761281 2017-12-03 11:50:36 UTC <zoomer46> @DavidOAtkins If his jaws are moving, he is telling lies.
937281625284665344 2017-12-03 11:25:27 UTC <zoomer46> @SarahKSilverman And anger is a great cover for depression.
937281059724709888 2017-12-03 11:23:13 UTC <zoomer46> I can't imagine even being in the same room with these despicable people.
937104584354525189 2017-12-02 23:41:58 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Be glad you didn't read the book. I was scarred for life.
937084248615473153 2017-12-02 22:21:09 UTC <zoomer46> I have a coffee mug with starry night on it.
937079710160506881 2017-12-02 22:03:07 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 @citizenkawala Dave's not here.
937071902937501698 2017-12-02 21:32:06 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 That's what you have two hands for.
937064710104641537 2017-12-02 21:03:31 UTC <zoomer46> @SethAbramson @bl4kk4t She will but the good news is that only 34 percent of the population listen to her. Even that is remarkable.
937061128135479297 2017-12-02 20:49:17 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Both but wait, there's more.
937055287999188992 2017-12-02 20:26:04 UTC <zoomer46> @waltshaub Seems like Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he asked Comey to back off. Trump is dumber than I thought.
937052280523771904 2017-12-02 20:14:07 UTC <zoomer46> @SaraJBenincasa Many battles make a war. This is war and we lost one. There will be others to fight.
936978080580734977 2017-12-02 15:19:17 UTC <zoomer46> @HouseGOP @NancySinatra That's a very good question.
936974440683974657 2017-12-02 15:04:49 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind But we have to have an astounding voter turnout.
936973875468029952 2017-12-02 15:02:34 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind November is not that far away.
936971718190616577 2017-12-02 14:54:00 UTC <zoomer46> @bimmerella I think GOP has actually shot itself in the foot.
936968516795817985 2017-12-02 14:41:17 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo I have quite a few in limbo right now.
936968376504799233 2017-12-02 14:40:43 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll You got that right.
936792402638938113 2017-12-01 03:01:28 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @MichaelSkolnik What a contrast between two very different presidents.
936742482406191107 2017-12-01 23:43:06 UTC <zoomer46> @WordsAreMighty @Amy_Siskind They are both nuts.
936724539672793095 2017-12-01 22:31:48 UTC <zoomer46> @2shea07 @theanxietyjunky @Doggothegrand - Hi! Happy to have you in my community :) (insight by http://commun.it)
936689950048833536 2017-12-01 20:14:21 UTC <zoomer46> @SethAbramson This.
936687817597636608 2017-12-01 20:05:53 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo What's the rush?
936678530800332800 2017-12-01 19:28:59 UTC <zoomer46> @Paiyslee Funny.
936678251027730433 2017-12-01 19:27:52 UTC <zoomer46> @cindyrelish I have decided not to be surprised that trump surprises me.
936648067205517312 2017-12-01 17:27:55 UTC <zoomer46> @AtomicShock2012 @cavellclaire1 @GutterTrash76 - You're my top community member this week! -  Grow your followers with https://commun.it/grow-your-followers/?tc=n&aid=thankyou189

936556115285938177 2017-12-01 11:22:32 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen @cindyrelish His inane tweets only help us.
936550565940813827 2017-12-01 11:00:29 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @DGB_JAIID And the beat goes on...

936396482323902464 2017-11-30 00:48:13 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 wasn't exactly on my radar
936384224491458561 2017-11-30 23:59:30 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 trusty beast.
936369030864211968 2017-11-30 22:59:08 UTC <zoomer46> @solusnan1 @Sams1stDaughter Ivanka is a legend in her own mind.
936359391279898624 2017-11-30 22:20:50 UTC <zoomer46> @iamstevienelson @cherrilizabiff really. never seen them in the same place together either.
936356536292659201 2017-11-30 22:09:29 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind There's h o p e.
936355506377064449 2017-11-30 22:05:24 UTC <zoomer46> @sarahkendzior Meanwhile...
936352380513374209 2017-11-30 21:52:58 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan A favorite target of clueless old white guys.
936351419120148480 2017-11-30 21:49:09 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis Most of the baby boomers will be dead when the bill comes due. What a legacy.
936346827624013824 2017-11-30 21:30:54 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @SenFeinstein Just another day on the Republican controlled Hill.
936341805527904256 2017-11-30 21:10:57 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 I think he kept them guessing until the last minute. Maybe he is sandbagging here.
936339385074835457 2017-11-30 21:01:20 UTC <zoomer46> @KamalaHarris The state of affairs in this great republic is so discouraging. I can't believe the news any more.  The whole thing is shameful.
936338565985980417 2017-11-30 20:58:05 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 @1111hampton Lest we not Forget.
936337950236868608 2017-11-30 20:55:38 UTC <zoomer46> @EAKoyle @PalmerReport Lord I hope so.
936336939757731844 2017-11-30 20:51:37 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis And POTUS thinks we are fine.
936336202357198848 2017-11-30 20:48:41 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 @1111hampton W. T. F.
936336112297168896 2017-11-30 20:48:20 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 I saw it too. I surely hope not.
936335307108159489 2017-11-30 20:45:08 UTC <zoomer46> @jaketapper @anthonyLfisher @iamscottblade @buckhondo @free_dm @nadianboone Christ threw the money changers out of the temple.
936335027767599104 2017-11-30 20:44:01 UTC <zoomer46> @anthonyLfisher Yes. Don't forget SATAN.
936334480784027648 2017-11-30 20:41:51 UTC <zoomer46> @BarackObama The men in the white coats are going to drag this crazy out of the WH.
936333197880823809 2017-11-30 20:36:45 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu If the shoe fits...
936316591444254720 2017-11-30 19:30:45 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis Smoking weed always made me...i forget.
936315472718499843 2017-11-30 19:26:19 UTC <zoomer46> @AngryRaccoon2 Yum
936314854289432577 2017-11-30 19:23:51 UTC <zoomer46> @funder God. I hope you are correct. Voter turnout has to improve though.
936312556716687360 2017-11-30 19:14:44 UTC <zoomer46> @PromoteMyCause He obviously likes Russia.
936311625769996291 2017-11-30 19:11:02 UTC <zoomer46> @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @PreetBharara When was this?
936311324723826688 2017-11-30 19:09:50 UTC <zoomer46> @iamstevienelson @cherrilizabiff HAVE you seen them lately?
936310802503565312 2017-11-30 19:07:45 UTC <zoomer46> @chrisdonovan Well?
936310450580611072 2017-11-30 19:06:21 UTC <zoomer46> @JanetSm90210 Of course they can.
936205459287171072 2017-11-30 12:09:10 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu Just when you think things can't get dumber. We hear from this...what. Moron.
936204717872549888 2017-11-30 12:06:13 UTC <zoomer46> @TheRoot @1Progressivism We need to vote in astounding numbers in 2018. These criminals in the WH and on the Hill have to suffer some consequences. If we don't we risk losing our Republic forever. We seem to at the edge.
936203811315732482 2017-11-30 12:02:37 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 You lead an interesting life.
936075143234949121 2017-11-29 03:31:20 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @CoryBooker @JeannieG40 Clear and concise.
936074905606553602 2017-11-29 03:30:23 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu I think I learned about Lewis and C l ark in elementary school.
936074386897035265 2017-11-29 03:28:19 UTC <zoomer46> @williamlegate @danicalynn1988 To hell with them all.
936073546203320320 2017-11-29 03:24:59 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 @Currtis25Harr What happened?
936048480925122561 2017-11-29 01:45:23 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Now thats creepy.
936048431453401089 2017-11-29 01:45:11 UTC <zoomer46> It is getting cold. This gets me centered. Every year this time.pic.twitter.com/EvwzfUTdDN
936039684802797570 2017-11-29 01:10:26 UTC <zoomer46> @danicalynn1988 We have to have better voter turnouts in future elections to rid us of this scourge.
936010650450583552 2017-11-29 23:15:03 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa It is always okay when it happens to the other guy's family.
936007114018967560 2017-11-29 23:01:00 UTC <zoomer46> @BillKristol Positive abstract human qualities seem to be beyond the scope of some intellects.
936006126818283520 2017-11-29 22:57:05 UTC <zoomer46> @neilpX So serene and inviting.
936005424679129089 2017-11-29 22:54:18 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis @soledadobrien Calls it like it is.
936000699439173632 2017-11-29 22:35:31 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll He should go somewhere where he is appreciated and use a no huddle offence. That is his style
935991862837563394 2017-11-29 22:00:24 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo It will.
935991777986785280 2017-11-29 22:00:04 UTC <zoomer46> @carm2158 @XanderTaylor3 I am not retweeting Trump anymore. We all know what he is.
935990952107413504 2017-11-29 21:56:47 UTC <zoomer46> @landolfi @SenKamalaHarris We are all basically the same.
935990702730809344 2017-11-29 21:55:48 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Ooh. There's an award for this?
935989808874315776 2017-11-29 21:52:14 UTC <zoomer46> @alliewen21 It helps to split wood. The cosmos aligns.
935989198485622785 2017-11-29 21:49:49 UTC <zoomer46> @CHEFFY_1969 Yes.
935985942917255168 2017-11-29 21:36:53 UTC <zoomer46> @meow2438 @OPCGhost Ha. I was joking but should know better.

935985341659525122 2017-11-29 21:34:29 UTC <zoomer46> @firebrand3 I get it. It's a conundrum.
935985013593661442 2017-11-29 21:33:11 UTC <zoomer46> @meow2438 And the Pope is not a Catholic.
935984422637236224 2017-11-29 21:30:50 UTC <zoomer46> @InvictusDad @Rrrocambolesco Just slip out the back Jack.
935968978559754243 2017-11-29 20:29:28 UTC <zoomer46> @cindyrelish In due time. The wheels grind slowly.
935968149584965632 2017-11-29 20:26:10 UTC <zoomer46> @benlandis Oh yes.
935962958575951874 2017-11-29 20:05:33 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Hello?
935962077998583808 2017-11-29 20:02:03 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis  Your photographs are amazing.
935872851953029120 2017-11-29 14:07:30 UTC <zoomer46> @GutterTrash76 Because it was there.
935862211746156544 2017-11-29 13:25:13 UTC <zoomer46> @KoulaStoll They still have no offensive line. I knew they would do this and blame the QB.
935817807337590784 2017-11-29 10:28:46 UTC <zoomer46> @davidmkeynes @JeannieG40 I  can't believe that.
935814860025286657 2017-11-29 10:17:03 UTC <zoomer46> @thehill They wouldn't have been seated there.
935804037643030528 2017-11-29 09:34:03 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis Beautiful
935797754936340480 2017-11-29 09:09:05 UTC <zoomer46> @The_Dixon_Cider BS as usual.
935688508555096064 2017-11-28 01:54:59 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump You lost the popular vote.
935656864213274624 2017-11-28 23:49:14 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX GOP owns this tax bill. Read it and weep. Payback at the polls is eminent.
935652501101207552 2017-11-28 23:31:54 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis How its done north of the border.
935636669956591621 2017-11-28 22:29:00 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis Well. This makes it all worthwhile.
935635791774191616 2017-11-28 22:25:30 UTC <zoomer46> @Shareblue @paraempathetic @owillis Makes no sense.
935635427830181888 2017-11-28 22:24:03 UTC <zoomer46> @Smartassicus I remember the Dugan Bakers truck arriving in our driveway and the driver yelling "Dugan Bakers...for the home."
935632444929314817 2017-11-28 22:12:12 UTC <zoomer46> @cattleranch1 The indictments can't come fast enough.
935631920150478848 2017-11-28 22:10:07 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis How we look from north of the border.
935626462635483138 2017-11-28 21:48:26 UTC <zoomer46> @TheRynheart Where there is smoke there is fire.
935625403070328832 2017-11-28 21:44:13 UTC <zoomer46> @MarkRuffalo Lord I hope so.
935623929091297282 2017-11-28 21:38:22 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind Me too. But we have to vote in astounding numbers to counteract this corruption. We can do this. I have faith in this great  nation.
935618875781197825 2017-11-28 21:18:17 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @chrislhayes You are on your own, Paulie.
935610760054616064 2017-11-28 20:46:02 UTC <zoomer46> @ElleSteinmeyer Don't give it back.
935610414330793985 2017-11-28 20:44:40 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Maybe we could plan a dog napping. You know Ninja outfits and like that...
935602596701769728 2017-11-28 20:13:36 UTC <zoomer46> @PressSec @VABVOX Petty. PETTY? My god.
935565670812700672 2017-11-28 17:46:52 UTC <zoomer46> @sliver_of Ah.
935475390818258944 2017-11-28 11:48:08 UTC <zoomer46> @davidfrum @Ez4u2say_Janis Interesting article.
935282791482298368 2017-11-27 23:02:48 UTC <zoomer46> @krassenstein No you cannot.
935278713494736896 2017-11-27 22:46:36 UTC <zoomer46> @BearmanShannon We can do this!
935277189775360000 2017-11-27 22:40:33 UTC <zoomer46> @sliver_of @bammersacat Ah. A fine thing.
935274529135394818 2017-11-27 22:29:58 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 My dad used to say that there are more nuts than bolts.
935274140226945025 2017-11-27 22:28:26 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo I would say he has blown his chances with the nursing staff.
935273549115351042 2017-11-27 22:26:05 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 What is this person talking about?
935273261839118342 2017-11-27 22:24:56 UTC <zoomer46> No doubt about it. It's a racial slur. Not even close to being humorous.
935244004727410690 2017-11-27 20:28:41 UTC <zoomer46> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @CharismaMolotov Sorry to say. Its obvious Trump doesnt know what an oath is. Or doesnt honor them. An abstract concept like this is beyond him.
935222591723368449 2017-11-27 19:03:36 UTC <zoomer46> @krassenstein Sometimes its hard to take the high road.
935220458865250305 2017-11-27 18:55:07 UTC <zoomer46> @LaineNola I am telling you. This new normal is possibly worse than anything else going on.
935218922764238848 2017-11-27 18:49:01 UTC <zoomer46> @CampKayio Fox would win by default.
935189125996711937 2017-11-27 16:50:37 UTC <zoomer46> @K_VanExel @JohnFugelsang Fake news
935187252711510017 2017-11-27 16:43:10 UTC <zoomer46> @alicek Such NICE people.
935166030141427717 2017-11-27 15:18:50 UTC <zoomer46> @panamapammie @cherylogle @brando5112 @Kris_Sacrebleu @donna_Siciliana @ShelbyKentStewa @un_belizable @TammyLynne89 @zycr9 @SelfImposedXile @LsExaminedLife @TarynStanford @CharismaMolotov @NoTakeItLyinDon @wmbo @cindyrelish @co_rapunzel4 I hope he burns in hell.
934959686897586176 2017-11-26 01:38:54 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Time to start talking about an intervention.
934938987973828608 2017-11-26 00:16:39 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 @BeeHaven007 They dont all grin.
934875687323951105 2017-11-26 20:05:07 UTC <zoomer46> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @dooklala Good to hear from across the pond.  You see it too. Dont worry trump will be gone soon.
934862512658571264 2017-11-26 19:12:46 UTC <zoomer46> @SenGillibrand It certainly is worth a try
934810959327133698 2017-11-26 15:47:55 UTC <zoomer46> @wesley_jordan Really great liars have to have great memories to keep everything straight. This putz cant remember what day it is.
934810416156430337 2017-11-26 15:45:45 UTC <zoomer46> @MauraLeeLang @Gus_802 And so look what happened. Arrogant and ignorant. A very bad combination.
934809269832241152 2017-11-26 15:41:12 UTC <zoomer46> @rocket_rosie That person should come down and watch. Friend for life?
934806780173078528 2017-11-26 15:31:18 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Me too. We are screwed if I am wrong.
934806092059734016 2017-11-26 15:28:34 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 If we get out the vote in an astonishing way they can never defeat us and we can redeem ourselves in the eyes of the world.
934774030510514176 2017-11-26 13:21:10 UTC <zoomer46> @2020fight And thinks we are all there with him.
934773899660808192 2017-11-26 13:20:39 UTC <zoomer46> @2020fight Trump is in some sort of bizarre space time warp where you can make up your own reality.
934773124045983744 2017-11-26 13:17:34 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @Cherrell_Brown I think its worse. Everyone you, trump.
934759803817218048 2017-11-26 12:24:38 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid Trump has been the strangest president. There is something seriously wrong with this charlatan.
934561586680868864 2017-11-25 23:17:00 UTC <zoomer46> @historylvrsclub When I was a little kid I used to stretch out on the back shelf of a Pontiac sedan.
934533647302119425 2017-11-25 21:25:58 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @suevee85 @mmpadellan Just another of many lies.
934532607165026305 2017-11-25 21:21:50 UTC <zoomer46> @ecclesias @krassenstein And we all must vote vote vote.
934532059393118209 2017-11-25 21:19:40 UTC <zoomer46> @sophielou I knew it all along. Except the nugats. Are they floor sweepings?
934531141067051008 2017-11-25 21:16:01 UTC <zoomer46> @ViewFromWise @soledadobrien I dont think so.
934530918030684160 2017-11-25 21:15:08 UTC <zoomer46> @slkavney @ariannahuff I am appalled.
934493510648156161 2017-11-25 18:46:29 UTC <zoomer46> @rocket_rosie @aroseblush Oh happy day.
934492854948376576 2017-11-25 18:43:53 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind I think we are on to something.
934462333702885376 2017-11-25 16:42:36 UTC <zoomer46> @renato_mariotti Dangerous man.
934461972896198661 2017-11-25 16:41:10 UTC <zoomer46> @20committee @sheLLbeLL_xo I guess a position paper is out of the question.
934448575475535872 2017-11-25 15:47:56 UTC <zoomer46> @PressSec @suevee85 @5kl Ah. The truth.
934422907714973698 2017-11-25 14:05:56 UTC <zoomer46> @TIME @thehill @NicoleGoodkind @VABVOX From which planet does this reporter originate?
934396154351116293 2017-11-25 12:19:38 UTC <zoomer46> @thedailybeast This woman is a pariah.
934395792009433088 2017-11-25 12:18:11 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Nice
934395609125093376 2017-11-25 12:17:28 UTC <zoomer46> @eugenegu Makes you think.
934393006668615681 2017-11-25 12:07:07 UTC <zoomer46> @TranslateRealDT Yes and LIFE is bringing back a retro special edition about me too. It will be huge beautiful and bring companies back home creating jobs.
934391929902698496 2017-11-25 12:02:50 UTC <zoomer46> @mame6432 @JonRiley7 Politicians now have a free pass. Anyone should be able to run now.
934391404645711872 2017-11-25 12:00:45 UTC <zoomer46> @3DTruth @AlexisGirlNovak The wandering maze of the conservative thought process continues to astound me.
934390571048857601 2017-11-25 11:57:26 UTC <zoomer46> @alansmurray Shock. The tiny fibber told another one. No cartoons this morning.
934235718460854272 2017-11-24 01:42:07 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo I knew it
934211467859189760 2017-11-24 00:05:45 UTC <zoomer46> @TIME @braden_rose @Smartassicus Yes. Id like to see that.
934208281110867970 2017-11-24 23:53:05 UTC <zoomer46> @Solutioneer72 @thinkprogress I feel so much safer now. What ethnic group is next?
934204875986042880 2017-11-24 23:39:33 UTC <zoomer46> @TIME @braden_rose @Smartassicus Oh good idea. Go right to the source.
934204527644958720 2017-11-24 23:38:10 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Enjoying the Titanic reference.
934195346909138946 2017-11-24 23:01:41 UTC <zoomer46> @bravenak Dear god. Come to your senses and back someone who can win. Sanders is too old divisive and nobody likes him west of the Hudson.
934194699157540864 2017-11-24 22:59:07 UTC <zoomer46> @brontyman @danibostick Isnt it wonderful how famous I am, Mommy? Love me. Love me.
934193314424872961 2017-11-24 22:53:37 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo Dont do it.
934193120782245890 2017-11-24 22:52:51 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX Alas you overestimate el tigre.
934192950308950017 2017-11-24 22:52:10 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind There is not one word that serves this purpose
934150056101498880 2017-11-24 20:01:43 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX A heartbreaking weekend.
934147099008086016 2017-11-24 19:49:58 UTC <zoomer46> @TigerWoods @pgmckim @Lee_in_Iowa Dont worry. After he gets stiffed hell be a Democrat for sure.
934146255038672897 2017-11-24 19:46:37 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind I am sort of fascinated as to the thinking that goes on before posting something like this.
934145567743270917 2017-11-24 19:43:53 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind I really think she was an asset as a White House child and would probably enjoy some privacy at this point.
934129295521406976 2017-11-24 18:39:13 UTC <zoomer46> @sophielou @bammersacat And then when there is a breach in the wall you have to stop the flooding just like at the beach.
934128610851655681 2017-11-24 18:36:30 UTC <zoomer46> @YaffaDina @Baronesa1980 Holy smokes. This batshit looney sounds like he actually believes this.
934090277018578949 2017-11-24 16:04:11 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @DavidCornDC Lord. I love this.
934090052271067137 2017-11-24 16:03:17 UTC <zoomer46> @Submarine_Guy @RawStory I wonder why. Really. How come?
934089351700590593 2017-11-24 16:00:30 UTC <zoomer46> @wmbo Really? Taking it for granted all these years.
934081762363363329 2017-11-24 15:30:21 UTC <zoomer46> @Dogherder1 @Stonekettle Hey.
934081590489157633 2017-11-24 15:29:40 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler Good advice.
934080354968899584 2017-11-24 15:24:45 UTC <zoomer46> @aliasvaughn He can defy distract machinate all he wants but Muellers investigation grinds on.
934078949465972736 2017-11-24 15:19:10 UTC <zoomer46> @nickiknowsnada Oh the horror.
934078762471313408 2017-11-24 15:18:25 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @Totenleserin @MissVikkiV Dim. Good word.

934059758901964800 2017-11-24 14:02:55 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu Put them all on the same plane.
934055085260320768 2017-11-24 13:44:20 UTC <zoomer46> @krassenstein Speak on. It makes them loopy.

934021303681642497 2017-11-24 11:30:06 UTC <zoomer46> @TarynStanford Then kisses himself in the mirror saying...
934020859370590208 2017-11-24 11:28:20 UTC <zoomer46> @IvankaTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke @Interior @hikergal333 Those birds were mean to me?
934020510001885184 2017-11-24 11:26:57 UTC <zoomer46> @Ez4u2say_Janis @RVAwonk The hiring of Flynn in spite of Obamas warning is so dumb. It was the first of the anti Obama maneuvering.

933840092107608070 2017-11-23 23:30:02 UTC <zoomer46> @paraempathetic @kylegriffin1 An astonishingly shallow stream of consciousness to the wrong crowd.

933787653341892609 2017-11-23 20:01:40 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 I think deep down this is a solution to which many of this ilk subscribe.
933786946446471168 2017-11-23 19:58:51 UTC <zoomer46> @2020fight I am PROUD to say I have never thought my private parts were worthy of my photography.

933461659695370240 2017-11-22 22:26:17 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Havent heard anything. How about  it, Trump?  Why so unusually quiet on this subject.
933450291986432001 2017-11-22 21:41:06 UTC <zoomer46> @2020fight @KimBrandonP Now I know about quora.
933445624741187584 2017-11-22 21:22:34 UTC <zoomer46> @2020fight I thought it was a good question. I just didnt have an answer. I was raised with the concept that there are no dumb questions.

932362360907583488 2017-11-19 21:38:03 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid Oh yes and because we are a free society we get to voice an opinion about Hannity.

932325352164286464 2017-11-19 19:11:00 UTC <zoomer46> @FlitterOnFraud @maggieNYT Once again Trump takes the low road.

932285728666669057 2017-11-19 16:33:33 UTC <zoomer46> @bimmerella @Kris_Sacrebleu Maybe the RNC recognizes the concept of throwing good money after bad.

I suddenly feel protective. Maybe he is a friend. Or is he a mean adversary. I wonder about these things.
932258088668844032 2017-11-19 14:43:43 UTC <zoomer46> @samstein Talk about a confusing message.

932202199983316992 2017-11-19 11:01:38 UTC <zoomer46> @AmbassadorRice I went to high school in the sixties. Social Studies was mandatory and crucial to understanding how government works. This is basic information for an informed electorate in these tumultuous times.

931160512758460416 2017-11-16 14:02:21 UTC <zoomer46> @WesSmith123 @funder This is scary. The whole thing is.
931160237767307264 2017-11-16 14:01:15 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler @debmacp1 Bannon must have a death wish.
931159822959042560 2017-11-16 13:59:36 UTC <zoomer46> @carm2158 @AngryBlackLady Inappropriate but still two consenting adults.
931134673874575361 2017-11-16 12:19:40 UTC <zoomer46> @Joseph4Meg @tankcat perfect.
931134406001156096 2017-11-16 12:18:36 UTC <zoomer46> @VibeCliques so is it safe to come out now?
931118838174879745 2017-11-16 11:16:45 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler My guess is that she wasn't 14 when you married her.
930947129694216193 2017-11-15 23:54:26 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan If six woman came forward how many are silent? My guess is in the hundreds
930945997248884736 2017-11-15 23:49:56 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @BillKristol Oh come on. Most good books have no pictures.
930945676430716928 2017-11-15 23:48:40 UTC <zoomer46> @CNN @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa He doesn't know what he is saying. He just opens his mouth and the spewage begins.
930940430241419264 2017-11-15 23:27:49 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan And the grope goes on.
930936707922395136 2017-11-15 23:13:01 UTC <zoomer46> @thistallawkgirl "Every man over forty is responsible for his face." Lincoln.
930922924147650561 2017-11-15 22:18:15 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX So I suppose appointing knowledgeable people to posts is off the table too.
930922358554099713 2017-11-15 22:16:00 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX Shocking what normal is today.
930918092271693824 2017-11-15 21:59:03 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu This is what an honest campaign would do without any questions asked. This is a great reality check.
930916063554031616 2017-11-15 21:50:59 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @Redpainter1 None of these idiots do their homework.
930915459792293888 2017-11-15 21:48:35 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 I know he is.
930807130893905921 2017-11-15 14:38:08 UTC <zoomer46> @HillaryClinton @margaritateresa @Stonekettle I agree. Get this out of the unsubstantiated accusation realm and into reality. See you in court!
930806760683663362 2017-11-15 14:36:39 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @BanditRandom These bastards are a bunch of hypocrites. The Roy Moore debacle and their non reaction proves this. Christians of convenience only.
930806358768738304 2017-11-15 14:35:04 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @twizler557 How could he. They read.
930804751612051457 2017-11-15 14:28:40 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 zero followers?
930776076552425472 2017-11-15 12:34:44 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Makes you wonder.
930775656056664064 2017-11-15 12:33:04 UTC <zoomer46> @MrDorsam @goldengateblond Trump must be in what Vonnegut called infundibulum.
930775094057725952 2017-11-15 12:30:50 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 This ilk is so weird and arrogant. If one of them was in my house I would throw them out.
930568840248987649 2017-11-14 22:51:15 UTC <zoomer46> @NPR So how about we redeploy our resources from illegal alien search to potential assault weapon murderer search.
930567698177777665 2017-11-14 22:46:43 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @MarkRuffalo Bingo.
930563037337128963 2017-11-14 22:28:11 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu I am not that popular so I fly under their radar.
930562798039519232 2017-11-14 22:27:14 UTC <zoomer46> @barry_corindia Absolutely not!
930562617692835840 2017-11-14 22:26:31 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Wow. Me too. I just felt my skin crawl when in their presence.
930562284161822720 2017-11-14 22:25:12 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Assholes.
930561523864473609 2017-11-14 22:22:10 UTC <zoomer46> @ybarrap When someone is this screwed up they think they are invisible.
930241188237635584 2017-11-13 01:09:16 UTC <zoomer46> @Acosta Trump is a dangerous clown.
930240400648036354 2017-11-13 01:06:09 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 @DavidJollyFL What no chick-fil-a?
930239680444092416 2017-11-13 01:03:17 UTC <zoomer46> @Mikel_Jollett What are they hiding? Makes you wonder.
930238878400811009 2017-11-13 01:00:06 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc If you are a thinking republican now you have to wonder why.
930221926877945856 2017-11-13 23:52:44 UTC <zoomer46> @atruechula I need this.
930220493822676992 2017-11-13 23:47:03 UTC <zoomer46> @atruechula gold metal material.
930219563308011520 2017-11-13 23:43:21 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan I would have to agree with this.
930212510854025217 2017-11-13 23:15:19 UTC <zoomer46> @RWPUSA @Skamama01 I think you are right.
930208031115235328 2017-11-13 22:57:31 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind this is very much like the thriller that goes on and on and on and...
930207588448440320 2017-11-13 22:55:46 UTC <zoomer46> @Skamama01 @RWPUSA that's the way they roll!
930207276849344513 2017-11-13 22:54:31 UTC <zoomer46> @JoSantisteban @PalmerReport and the beat goes on...
930207007738654720 2017-11-13 22:53:27 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 and now for the night shift!
930110690400133120 2017-11-13 16:30:43 UTC <zoomer46> @AlexWitt @AP Fool
930109766332010496 2017-11-13 16:27:03 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid Nature abhors a vacuum so they have to focus on something.
930095085680766976 2017-11-13 15:28:43 UTC <zoomer46> @HillaryClinton @girlsreallyrule Younger!!!!!
930071170203963397 2017-11-13 13:53:41 UTC <zoomer46> @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @morningmika @hikergal333 Ooh. Evil.
930053908160016384 2017-11-13 12:45:05 UTC <zoomer46> @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @morningmika @hikergal333 I like it better.
930053219664977920 2017-11-13 12:42:21 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @fawfulfan Or now more room in the trailers kitchen.
930053072998617088 2017-11-13 12:41:46 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @fawfulfan Wow. Now they have to go to Starbucks for coffee.
930026645548879873 2017-11-13 10:56:46 UTC <zoomer46> @kentpierce8 What a bureaucratic debacle. Don't we all feel safer now?
930025050480181248 2017-11-13 10:50:25 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid @donnabrazile @hikergal333 I can't listen to her.
930024765510864896 2017-11-13 10:49:17 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind Very interesting.
930023587225972736 2017-11-13 10:44:36 UTC <zoomer46> @suevee85 @57_aharrison The effects of this kind of criminal activity causes wide ranging trauma.
929882668652748801 2017-11-12 01:24:39 UTC <zoomer46> @kurteichenwald Hypocrites
929862980279394305 2017-11-12 00:06:25 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic People actually believe this rubbish?
929818979681611777 2017-11-12 21:11:34 UTC <zoomer46> @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @rosieglow2010 @IronStache This is pathetic.
929818604035629057 2017-11-12 21:10:05 UTC <zoomer46> @Bosphiz @SocialPowerOne1 Maybe just maybe the voters in Alabama will do the right thing and solve this debacle.
929817888248225793 2017-11-12 21:07:14 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan My what short memories we have.
929811891802857477 2017-11-12 20:43:24 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa @tedlieu My instinct is to assume Trump is lying and believe the CIA Director.
929746105637769216 2017-11-12 16:22:00 UTC <zoomer46> @merylnyc There is no need to believe anything our president says.
929745625842880512 2017-11-12 16:20:05 UTC <zoomer46> You are doing well
929743739379159041 2017-11-12 16:12:35 UTC <zoomer46> Good article.
929707015231782912 2017-11-12 13:46:40 UTC <zoomer46> @CampKayio You know. The ilk in charge really have no respect for the common man or woman. God I hate the 21st century
929702248535543810 2017-11-12 13:27:43 UTC <zoomer46> @FLOTUS @pgmckim @max_burbank Na. Na. Sticks and stones may break my bones but names...holy smokes our president. And the stones are nuclear weapons.
929701658849718272 2017-11-12 13:25:23 UTC <zoomer46> @CampKayio This flies in the face of reason.
929701010565664769 2017-11-12 13:22:48 UTC <zoomer46> @TiffanyHaddish @Solutioneer72 @nbcsnl Good advice.
929700198514855936 2017-11-12 13:19:34 UTC <zoomer46> @DavidCornDC Trump is either lying or very naive.
929677251574140928 2017-11-12 11:48:24 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler Its reduced to this. Mental instability would be better than a cold calculated attack on the constitution. I fear for our grand experiment.
929674823189614592 2017-11-12 11:38:45 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler Trump seems to be in the throws of an attempted hostile takeover.
929672997132292096 2017-11-12 11:31:29 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler Yes. W would be an improvement. I just thought the political pendulum had swung. This is different.
929661529309491200 2017-11-12 10:45:55 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler What a horse's ass.
929660675089162241 2017-11-12 10:42:31 UTC <zoomer46> @BretStephensNYT @SenJohnMcCain Interesting.
929605498831294464 2017-11-11 07:03:16 UTC <zoomer46> @BrendanNyhan W. T. F.
929506578633457666 2017-11-11 00:30:12 UTC <zoomer46> @MsMariaT @funder Maybe he should head for Argentina.
929506290296115200 2017-11-11 00:29:03 UTC <zoomer46> @rocket_rosie Who are these people?
929500227295465472 2017-11-11 00:04:58 UTC <zoomer46> @thehill And stuff.
929476020964593664 2017-11-11 22:28:46 UTC <zoomer46> @sheLLbeLL_xo There's a thought.
929471505666277376 2017-11-11 22:10:50 UTC <zoomer46> @RichardHaass There will always be another rabbit to pull out of the hat with this guy.
929438941434073088 2017-11-11 20:01:26 UTC <zoomer46> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @hikergal333 And they vote too.
929437885459238913 2017-11-11 19:57:14 UTC <zoomer46> @danpfeiffer That could very well be true. Or maybe he has a crush on him.
929436833305583617 2017-11-11 19:53:03 UTC <zoomer46> @leahmcelrath He always lies. Nobody ever seems to get this.
929406107369590784 2017-11-11 17:50:58 UTC <zoomer46> @BarackObama @mitchelle785 @MichelleObama 25 more!!!!
929399282259591168 2017-11-11 17:23:50 UTC <zoomer46> @rezaaslan Lets just face it. When Trump opens his mouth hes lying. Makes things simpler.
929392899485241349 2017-11-11 16:58:29 UTC <zoomer46> @NeverMorebush @MollyMcKew Really. The hookers are a minor distraction.
929344707272028160 2017-11-11 13:46:59 UTC <zoomer46> @therealLAVALLEE @peterdaou You must be older than dirt.
929328104425840642 2017-11-11 12:41:00 UTC <zoomer46> @tedlieu Defending child molestation will be the GOP's undoing not to mention their tax plan, efforts to rape the environment and health care. They have underestimated the American people.
929326749963509761 2017-11-11 12:35:37 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler There IS  a God.
929326353014501377 2017-11-11 12:34:03 UTC <zoomer46> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @hikergal333 I refuse to acknowledge this moron's presence on this planet.
929076492402937856 2017-11-10 20:01:11 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan And they will eventually pay at the polls. Do they really think we will put up with this shit?
929067645638455297 2017-11-10 19:26:02 UTC <zoomer46> @dcexaminer @AaronBlake O. M. G.
929060654249644032 2017-11-10 18:58:15 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Leave the car. Run for your life.
929060383595356160 2017-11-10 18:57:11 UTC <zoomer46> @robreiner You don't get it. They have God on their side.
928889291517976577 2017-11-09 07:37:19 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid @ja50nd4vi5 @SykesCharlie  They have the ability to overlook minor inconveniences like pussy grabbing and molestation.
928888614716571650 2017-11-09 07:34:38 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc @angryaussie  Brilliant. I am sure this thought process can be utilized by the GOP here.
928887865295093760 2017-11-09 07:31:39 UTC <zoomer46> @Newsweek @LaineNola Don't laugh. Remember how funny the thought of the Donald as president was?
928751097346494464 2017-11-09 22:28:11 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Oh my. Here we go again with another diversion. Pathetic and transparent.
928568655528460288 2017-11-09 10:23:14 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @SenWhitehouse @patfoster698 @WBLgkj I have never been afraid of hiring someone who knows more than I do.
928568332764229632 2017-11-09 10:21:57 UTC <zoomer46> @GOP @NRA @BrianPaulStuart I don't think I have ever met people like this in person. How they get elected has continually mystified me.
928567203569512448 2017-11-09 10:17:27 UTC <zoomer46> @GOP @NRA @BrianPaulStuart These men are shameless.
928567046639677441 2017-11-09 10:16:50 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid @K_VanExel @StevenReyCristo  Wouldn't it be fantastic if Trump one day was not newsworthy. Life would be so much better.
928556172050870272 2017-11-09 09:33:37 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Where can I get some.
928555820874428416 2017-11-09 09:32:14 UTC <zoomer46> @LaineNola @1plus1forevery1 @StateDept  Trump is a greedy incompetent immoral moron. And guess what. I am not Obama.
928380074327445506 2017-11-08 21:53:52 UTC <zoomer46> @Skamama01 @TheVampMina me too. I listened to her this am and she seemed like she would say anything convenient.
928371010193248256 2017-11-08 21:17:51 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Those percentages are scary.
928262898882883584 2017-11-08 14:08:16 UTC <zoomer46> @khankiso Nice
928262778758029312 2017-11-08 14:07:47 UTC <zoomer46> But we have a long way to go.
928256046581329920 2017-11-08 13:41:02 UTC <zoomer46> Good day in America.
928079279681916929 2017-11-07 01:58:37 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Yay for the good guys.
928079140745547776 2017-11-07 01:58:04 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc Good God yes.
927686804639289345 2017-11-06 23:59:04 UTC <zoomer46> @K_VanExel @HillaryWarnedUs Lord I hope so.
927673831749275650 2017-11-06 23:07:31 UTC <zoomer46> @CheriJacobus @margaritateresa @LouiseMensch and it was about how to fund it
927651047799164930 2017-11-06 21:36:59 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @jogopow makes sense to me.
927647905351073795 2017-11-06 21:24:30 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 One good, honest man or woman. That may be a stretch.
927640967066411008 2017-11-06 20:56:55 UTC <zoomer46> @WisePaxCat @solusnan1 @HuffPostPol  Doing the same thing over and over expecting different results...insanity.
927622981764907010 2017-11-06 19:45:27 UTC <zoomer46> @WaffleHouse @BeautyBind @waltb31 @EdWGillespie  No big loss. Those places are disgusting.
927621327560822784 2017-11-06 19:38:53 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc @KariVanHorn @nacho_scout  What's the number for 911?
927620405849939972 2017-11-06 19:35:13 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid This is great advice.
927336214851653632 2017-11-05 00:45:57 UTC <zoomer46> @SenateGOP @PressSec @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @hikergal333 Oh yes. And the prayers. Don't forget the prayers.
927335030011162624 2017-11-05 00:41:14 UTC <zoomer46> @ChrisMurphyCT Oh yes but we will pray for the victims and their families. Such a feel good moment.

926221396077895681 2017-11-02 22:56:03 UTC <zoomer46> @CNBC @BrianPaulStuart This kind of denial flies in the face of reason. I mean there is a video. How dumb is that?
926220585235034112 2017-11-02 22:52:50 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc @jackjonesbabe @herenowhere3 @AlasscanIsBack  Out of touch with reality or what.

925479441245011968 2017-10-31 21:47:48 UTC <zoomer46> @buffaloon That thought has crossed my mind.
925479126731055104 2017-10-31 21:46:33 UTC <zoomer46> @CNN @VlanTrunk @mdjfla55 @MichaelOprea1 @AshtonP1960 Should be interesting approaching the pearly gates.

925478194261749761 2017-10-31 21:42:50 UTC <zoomer46> @guardian @Nigel_Farage @BeautyBind The most amazing thing about this is that none of it is surprising.

925476927305076737 2017-10-31 21:37:48 UTC <zoomer46> @Salon @GStuedler Very strange nomenclature. President Clinton. How convenient.
925476471916957708 2017-10-31 21:36:00 UTC <zoomer46> @lisafittko @solusnan1 @john_sipher  Because their ship had come in and they know no shame.
925476168274530306 2017-10-31 21:34:47 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @Paiyslee @christinawilkie @ChrisHayesTV  His mouth runs on.

925475427581349888 2017-10-31 21:31:51 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind @peterdaou  I blame myself.
925474747739262977 2017-10-31 21:29:09 UTC <zoomer46> @CNNMoney @barry_corindia They should. There are other jobs out there.
925473503737982977 2017-10-31 21:24:12 UTC <zoomer46> @BeautyBind @MSNBC Flaws. Flaws? This kind of understatement is ludicrous. I love it.

924664338111254529 2017-10-29 15:48:52 UTC <zoomer46> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @hikergal333 @zachbraff  Pretty pathetic really.
924663002875547648 2017-10-29 15:43:33 UTC <zoomer46> @flouncingqueen @krisv_723  The canine consensus on standard time is mostly negative.

924379013208006656 2017-10-28 20:55:05 UTC <zoomer46> @someonesmomma I used to drink under a bridge but I was still pleasant.
924378741668708353 2017-10-28 20:54:00 UTC <zoomer46> @RepRubenGallego @MsMariaT  GOP would condone it. We need to win back the house and senate to impeach.
924376527093092352 2017-10-28 20:45:12 UTC <zoomer46> @GeorgeTakei What a charming man.

924374573281312768 2017-10-28 20:37:26 UTC <zoomer46> @funder @MsMariaT  This a like an old fashioned suspense movie.
924374146137624576 2017-10-28 20:35:45 UTC <zoomer46> @KamalaHarris It's one thing to announce a national emergency but quite another to fund it.

924081886871347200 2017-10-27 01:14:25 UTC <zoomer46> @Paiyslee @realDonaldTrump  I think your days are numbered.
924080270713683968 2017-10-27 01:07:59 UTC <zoomer46> @Joseph4Meg @nowin2613 @benjaminwittes  The wheels grind slowly but they do grind.
924030780715753477 2017-10-27 21:51:20 UTC <zoomer46> @AwfulHair_Hater should?

923881486109085697 2017-10-27 11:58:05 UTC <zoomer46> @AmazonTraveler @GStuedler @politicususa  I hope this is right. Which can't screw up like we did in 16.

923714872818454528 2017-10-26 00:56:02 UTC <zoomer46> @mschlapp @margaritateresa A man without a program.
923714546883289088 2017-10-26 00:54:44 UTC <zoomer46> @suannelqr @margaritateresa @mschlapp  Omg. A drunk trump is a frightening thought.
923713917477679104 2017-10-26 00:52:14 UTC <zoomer46> @ananavarro @margaritateresa @realDonaldTrump  We actually should not underestimate the GOP like we did in 2016.
923610103256928257 2017-10-26 17:59:43 UTC <zoomer46> @Yahoo @YaffaDina This is screwed up. Whatever happened to the right to free speech?

923283058438148097 2017-10-25 20:20:09 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler Trump is a classless bore.
923282100257771520 2017-10-25 20:16:21 UTC <zoomer46> @braden_rose Trump should hand out deoderant at his rallies. Now there would be a real accomplishment.
923281503320203264 2017-10-25 20:13:58 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan A great liar has to have a terrific memory to keep all his stories straight.

923280529658732544 2017-10-25 20:10:06 UTC <zoomer46> @GOP @VP @ChrisVanHollen @EileenMPOPP @AllochkaFL2017 These grifters have no idea what true Christianity is about. Love for one thing. Faith hope and charity for unusual concepts.
923279757868924930 2017-10-25 20:07:02 UTC <zoomer46> @SarahHuckabee @theClaudiaInez Cleaver and makeup can't digouise her vapid soul.

916415734800142338 2017-10-06 21:31:52 UTC <zoomer46> @barry_corindia That's proof trump is a moron.

914227177805303808 2017-09-30 20:35:19 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @SenWarren Trump leads from the rear. Hate that in a leader.
914226888301834240 2017-09-30 20:34:10 UTC <zoomer46> @andersoncooper It starts from the top. Trump is a f@!#up and it filters down.

914164549196054530 2017-09-30 16:26:27 UTC <zoomer46> @CarmenYulinCruz @KamalaHarris Trump doesn't consider Puerto Ricans people let alone American citizens. The man is a cretin.

913199527959650305 2017-09-27 00:31:48 UTC <zoomer46> @Slate Maybe they think what is going on in PR is a massive protest.

905550667191910400 2017-09-06 21:57:58 UTC <zoomer46> @vicenews @JeannieG40  Does that guy ever stop saying idiotic things?
905549647162298369 2017-09-06 21:53:54 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu You told us just for the halibut.
905544107363377152 2017-09-06 21:31:54 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc @HillaryWarnedUs  Underestimating the intense level of misogyny in this culture was a huge mistake and it is very sad.
905541563798966273 2017-09-06 21:21:47 UTC <zoomer46> @SaltyCorpse Honey and lemon?
905541434505400320 2017-09-06 21:21:16 UTC <zoomer46> @someonesmomma  Not a bad start.
905521864239407104 2017-09-06 20:03:30 UTC <zoomer46> @paulkrugman @bjorkianrice @realDonaldTrump  Lies happen when trump opens his mouth.
905512135773564928 2017-09-06 19:24:51 UTC <zoomer46> @alroker @margaritateresa @rushlimbaugh  Good for you, Al.
905500364732071937 2017-09-06 18:38:04 UTC <zoomer46> @Angry_Jake @TopherSpiro  This is disappointing.
905499212665815040 2017-09-06 18:33:30 UTC <zoomer46> @sum1star A man with a spine.
905498853893398530 2017-09-06 18:32:04 UTC <zoomer46> @HuffPostPol @sum1star Hmm. Meant always thought. Auto correct. Grr.
905489971930419200 2017-09-06 17:56:47 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu @baddgrl_ And do you count the dollar sign?
905489280595845120 2017-09-06 17:54:02 UTC <zoomer46> @brando5112 @joncoopertweets  Good lord. Do they still sell Dramamine?
905488712284430337 2017-09-06 17:51:46 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu @baddgrl_ 14? That many?
905487489284132864 2017-09-06 17:46:55 UTC <zoomer46> @TheLadyPilar @margaritateresa @mmfa  Hitting the oxytocin again?
905487229883219974 2017-09-06 17:45:53 UTC <zoomer46> @joncoopertweets There's a special place in hell for people like this.
905486749744451585 2017-09-06 17:43:58 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc I have. I think it's a desperate attempt from a shrinking electoral base.
905481722938236928 2017-09-06 17:24:00 UTC <zoomer46> @EmmaVigeland @CNNPolitics  He has whored himself out to the dark forces of the electorate.
905479793956806661 2017-09-06 17:16:20 UTC <zoomer46> @marcorubio @wildbilljvil22 Truer words have not been spoken.
905478967611838464 2017-09-06 17:13:03 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu @kylegriffin1  Another pearl of wisdom from our president.
905478669967208448 2017-09-06 17:11:52 UTC <zoomer46> @HuffPostPol @sum1star I always the this might be the case.
905478430074003458 2017-09-06 17:10:55 UTC <zoomer46> @AddInfoOrg @buffaloon It's a start.
905477888358715392 2017-09-06 17:08:46 UTC <zoomer46> @SaltyCorpse Add to the problem for two months a year. I'll try not to be obnoxious.
905476082694070272 2017-09-06 17:01:35 UTC <zoomer46> @detroitnews @Meercat42 @JeannieG40 Drives them crazy.
905475185008140288 2017-09-06 16:58:01 UTC <zoomer46> @ReimersBK @bashful_one @MeanwhileinCana  A very scary thought.
905473844240142336 2017-09-06 16:52:42 UTC <zoomer46> @perlmutations @leftyjennyc @nytpolitics  Hit the nail on the head, Ron.
905436891494928388 2017-09-06 14:25:51 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Trump is eat least amoral if not immoral.
905436630286311424 2017-09-06 14:24:49 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc The GOP has been sowing these seeds for decades and now they get to reap what they have sown.
905196445527138305 2017-09-05 22:30:25 UTC <zoomer46> @RawStory @realDonaldTrump @Mistress_Jan Just when I thought things couldn't get worse.
904870473061806084 2017-09-04 00:55:07 UTC <zoomer46> @TattleTSister @JeannieG40  That's plenty.
904455548267102208 2017-09-03 21:26:21 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Oh boy. You can smell it from there.
903718120682119168 2017-09-01 20:36:04 UTC <zoomer46> @PressSec @DeliliaOMalley Watch her feet. It's a dead giveaway.
903418765995642880 2017-08-31 00:46:33 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 My thoughts on this are; many people do, some do not and most are confused. L like me.
903378998230704130 2017-08-31 22:08:31 UTC <zoomer46> @RightWingWatch @nmbr1hussy Of course they did.
903377171565211648 2017-08-31 22:01:16 UTC <zoomer46> @JohnJHarwood @Bosphiz   Just who makes up this 34%
903376370222473218 2017-08-31 21:58:05 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan Where does she get off reading all those books.
903357253721485312 2017-08-31 20:42:07 UTC <zoomer46> @PaulBegala @margaritateresa @GovAbbott @DanPatrick @matthewjdowd  Money talks and bs walks.
903354957776244740 2017-08-31 20:33:00 UTC <zoomer46> @MichaelBerrySho @J_Fonte28  Inspirational.
903354493286408192 2017-08-31 20:31:09 UTC <zoomer46> @Jpete008 @zino54 @AP  THIS is true.
903354296485515264 2017-08-31 20:30:22 UTC <zoomer46> @theworlddd2121 Serene.
903347166277754880 2017-08-31 20:02:02 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 yes. Put it in the back seat. Some will escape to the front. Not to worry.
903308165344833536 2017-08-31 17:27:03 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 And is your dog polite enough to acknowledge?
903307682718908420 2017-08-31 17:25:08 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic And people believe this rubbish?
902834989292822528 2017-08-30 10:06:49 UTC <zoomer46> @Mikel_Jollett Amazing. Scary.
902487352731459584 2017-08-29 11:05:26 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 seems like a drastic move
902284985956171776 2017-08-28 21:41:18 UTC <zoomer46> @martin_kj @margaritateresa @CBSNews  Trump never disappoints
901942730049417218 2017-08-27 23:01:18 UTC <zoomer46> @VicenteFoxQue @theClaudiaInez Trump es muy loco.
901936359333617670 2017-08-27 22:35:59 UTC <zoomer46> @JebBush @margaritateresa @SenJohnMcCain @POTUS  Could this possibility be a republican trend to stand up and do the right thing?
901935823733624832 2017-08-27 22:33:52 UTC <zoomer46> @JebBush @margaritateresa @SenJohnMcCain @POTUS  I have to believe that this kind of thing will probably catch up with trump.
901934989171941376 2017-08-27 22:30:33 UTC <zoomer46> @Stonekettle @margaritateresa @realDonaldTrump  It's difficult to remain positive in this political situation.
901607494677618688 2017-08-26 00:49:12 UTC <zoomer46> @SaltyCorpse Six.
901577878772613120 2017-08-26 22:51:31 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien @margaritateresa  There is hope.
901577562794676226 2017-08-26 22:50:16 UTC <zoomer46> @SteveSchmidtSES @margaritateresa @CGasparino  And the scary thing is he may be normal for a republican.
901576816766443521 2017-08-26 22:47:18 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu @jcdav @FrancesRobles @HotlineJosh  Don't underestimate the level of stupidity.
901576528152207360 2017-08-26 22:46:09 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic People say some weird things
900858487567253504 2017-08-24 23:12:55 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Safe travels.
900858302334205952 2017-08-24 23:12:11 UTC <zoomer46> @Shareblue @Brasilmagic Conway has no sense of history.
900826505235894273 2017-08-24 21:05:50 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic oh boy. what a gene pool.
900514705575477248 2017-08-23 00:26:51 UTC <zoomer46> @RedTRaccoon @margaritateresa  It is a diversion. The issue is still Russia and how they perverted democracy.
900513200935981060 2017-08-23 00:20:52 UTC <zoomer46> @kylegriffin1 @margaritateresa @AP  Oh Lordy.  Wouldn't that be fun.
900511896507490305 2017-08-23 00:15:41 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu I miss the eclipse
900134607089172487 2017-08-22 23:16:28 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan The eclipse was nice though. It seemed to bring people together if even temporarily
900133131860271110 2017-08-22 23:10:36 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan I am sorry to say that I have to agree with you. This is all so depressing
900129063003729921 2017-08-22 22:54:26 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic How does she even think this stuff up
899915750013579264 2017-08-22 08:46:49 UTC <zoomer46> @2020fight happiness comes from within.
899746411985686530 2017-08-21 21:33:55 UTC <zoomer46> @RWPUSA @margaritateresa @nytimes  A heartfelt essay.
899743041858220032 2017-08-21 21:20:32 UTC <zoomer46> @christinawilkie @margaritateresa @jkelly3rd @USATODAY  Can't imagine protecting this grifter.
899676693358661632 2017-08-21 16:56:53 UTC <zoomer46> @2020fight @RealAlexJones  So how is a astrological event racist. Someone explain.
899598137660252161 2017-08-21 11:44:44 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic you reap what you sow.
899411376938131459 2017-08-20 23:22:37 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid @margaritateresa @Marcus4America @realDonaldTrump  Hmm. And they accuse the left of of staging ChArlottesville.
899410694319349760 2017-08-20 23:19:54 UTC <zoomer46> @Stonekettle @margaritateresa @thehill  Scuttling may not be necessary.
899410104084299776 2017-08-20 23:17:33 UTC <zoomer46> @Nelba_MG @margaritateresa @StevenBeschloss @ChrisMurphyCT  He is fine man who represents us well.
899298718712725504 2017-08-20 15:54:57 UTC <zoomer46> @bimmerella Falwell seems to be a poor judge of character.
899020202188218368 2017-08-19 21:28:13 UTC <zoomer46> @ybarrap of course he is. a lawyer at least knows the law. maybe even respects it.
899018592716455937 2017-08-19 21:21:50 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan i can't believe the egos on this ilk.
899006504208130048 2017-08-19 20:33:47 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan it's a sad state of affairs. it really is.
899000600054181889 2017-08-19 20:10:20 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan omg. only the dumb survive on that side of the aisle.
898999384687480832 2017-08-19 20:05:30 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan so trump makes no comment about the racist white supremacists or the nazis. this guy never surprises.
898997554758791169 2017-08-19 19:58:14 UTC <zoomer46> @CrothRoth17 @olgaNYC1211 because they are dumb.
898997358423310337 2017-08-19 19:57:27 UTC <zoomer46> @PaladinCornelia @Mikel_Jollett let the white supremacists slither on down the road.
898993877943803904 2017-08-19 19:43:37 UTC <zoomer46> @bimmerella @soledadobrien Good. Kessler is living in a hell of his own making.
898992658441306113 2017-08-19 19:38:46 UTC <zoomer46> @johalifax if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.
898991663007367168 2017-08-19 19:34:49 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc oh no. not this again. it's wet and damp and soapy but i DO get toweled off at the end. i guess its ok.
898838598459334656 2017-08-19 09:26:36 UTC <zoomer46> @justabadazz @JohnWDean  Hypocrites.
898664907461148672 2017-08-18 21:56:24 UTC <zoomer46> @Political_Ed_ @margaritateresa @SamanthaMalin the grifters all hang together.
898664045821042688 2017-08-18 21:52:59 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 looks good!
898656804376367104 2017-08-18 21:24:13 UTC <zoomer46> @will_c_fischer @ecclesias  Bunch of wannabes.
898656160173047809 2017-08-18 21:21:39 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @kalpenn @SopanDeb  Oh boy.
898655453890191360 2017-08-18 21:18:51 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc @SER1897 Good way to put it.
898646739942424576 2017-08-18 20:44:13 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc I am hoping you are overestimating GOP's ability to accomplish this caper.
898630674172723200 2017-08-18 19:40:23 UTC <zoomer46> @Paiyslee @TheRickWilson  A good day.
898626362411335681 2017-08-18 19:23:15 UTC <zoomer46> @GlennHurst12 This white supremacist needs to be ousted as well.
898624830886494209 2017-08-18 19:17:09 UTC <zoomer46> @washingtonpost @ChelseaClinton @InxsyS @mog7546 cowards.
898624595812532224 2017-08-18 19:16:13 UTC <zoomer46> @thehill This is happening faster than I had thought.
898623842192547840 2017-08-18 19:13:14 UTC <zoomer46> @gabrielsherman What could be better? An even more divided GOP.
898623220420456449 2017-08-18 19:10:46 UTC <zoomer46> @InxsyS Bannon. A good start. Gorka and Miller next.
898622381190545408 2017-08-18 19:07:25 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Had some last night!
898592835355590657 2017-08-18 17:10:01 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Really? Bannons is out?
898568250262298626 2017-08-18 15:32:20 UTC <zoomer46> @ashhmonster Good advice.
898557644516077569 2017-08-18 14:50:11 UTC <zoomer46> @InxsyS @LouTheDude1 I missed this?
898507052875628544 2017-08-18 11:29:09 UTC <zoomer46> @GeorgeTakei @GStuedler @realDonaldTrump  Truth is not an issue for Trump.
898506635072610304 2017-08-18 11:27:29 UTC <zoomer46> @perroned1 @patf304 @mmpadellan  You may be right.
898503769603878912 2017-08-18 11:16:06 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien @margaritateresa @zarzarbinkss  Pathetic.
898332898700414977 2017-08-17 23:57:07 UTC <zoomer46> @snarky_op @margaritateresa @Spicerlies @TrueFactsStated @lauferlaw @TheRickWilson @gouldjm16 @ericgarland  Oh.what a surprise.
898332033599942656 2017-08-17 23:53:41 UTC <zoomer46> @InxsyS If the white supremacists do the math they will put their guns away and go back under the rocks from whence they came.
898331118440546305 2017-08-17 23:50:03 UTC <zoomer46> @DeliliaOMalley Yup. Talk about genes...Or is it jeans.
898330580798001153 2017-08-17 23:47:55 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Retreating away and I am not Jewish.
898304710213599232 2017-08-17 22:05:07 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 Ok. What happens next?
898271480416526336 2017-08-17 19:53:04 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic And then hope the investigation takes pence down too..
898243803487883265 2017-08-17 18:03:05 UTC <zoomer46> @ValeriePlame Finally. Someone finds an apt description.
898240214103203842 2017-08-17 17:48:50 UTC <zoomer46> @Stonekettle @thehill  Wow. Astute observation.
898176201977712641 2017-08-17 13:34:28 UTC <zoomer46> @BillKristol Interesting.
897977699981037569 2017-08-16 00:25:41 UTC <zoomer46> @GQMagazine @Kris_Sacrebleu I love it when they fight amongst themselves.
897971851737092097 2017-08-16 00:02:27 UTC <zoomer46> @thenation @InxsyS Slink.I mean slink.
897971473675169792 2017-08-16 00:00:57 UTC <zoomer46> @thenation @InxsyS The Nazis will shrink away when confronted with superior numbers.
897970923793518592 2017-08-16 23:58:46 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @TheNormanLear @TheAtlantic @RosieGray  POTUS is either amoral, immoral or both.
897601396987580417 2017-08-15 23:30:24 UTC <zoomer46> @robreiner One can only hope.
897594614932262917 2017-08-15 23:03:27 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Yeah. Well. Then he is a dumb fuck who may just destroy this country.
897561381922275329 2017-08-15 20:51:23 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa No problem here.
897535737800871937 2017-08-15 19:09:29 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu @washingtonpost   This is still the major issue.
897534662427369473 2017-08-15 19:05:13 UTC <zoomer46> @badgirl_loony Disappointing that I am not surprised. What would it take?
897533987899547649 2017-08-15 19:02:32 UTC <zoomer46> @someonesmomma @LWennbo Bannon looks like an unmade bed.
897463917827563522 2017-08-15 14:24:06 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic @joesabin Good point but I think most of them are weak misguided souls.
897462020571836418 2017-08-15 14:16:34 UTC <zoomer46> @Newsweek @gollum1419_g Holy smokes.
897459677952450560 2017-08-15 14:07:15 UTC <zoomer46> @tomperriello Expose these bastards and shame them.
897459246211756032 2017-08-15 14:05:32 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic The white supremacists are like the playground bullies and will fold like a cheap suit.
897458735756578817 2017-08-15 14:03:31 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc And white supremacist in the white house.
897449524498542592 2017-08-15 13:26:55 UTC <zoomer46> @GOP @BrianPaulStuart Good lord. Vote this guy out.
897444871971196928 2017-08-15 13:08:25 UTC <zoomer46> @thehill This is adolescent behaviour and I am being kind.
897199761761202177 2017-08-14 20:54:27 UTC <zoomer46> @VA4Hillary1 @realDonaldTrump  There is no doubt that this cretin thinks that the white supremacists will get him reelected. He is a cheap..
897197858297978881 2017-08-14 20:46:53 UTC <zoomer46> @solusnan1 I sure hope you are right.
896522098277003265 2017-08-12 00:01:39 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 you can be the one to break this nasty trend.
896497642137677828 2017-08-12 22:24:28 UTC <zoomer46> @13Matters @robreiner Trump doesn't have the courage to criticize the white nationalists. Or worse, he agrees with them.
896452648395825152 2017-08-12 19:25:41 UTC <zoomer46> @someonesmomma I have to agree. These people are angry, misguided souls.
896404694788173824 2017-08-12 16:15:08 UTC <zoomer46> @GOP @BrianPaulStuart Here is a fine example that you reap what you sow.
896402391779745795 2017-08-12 16:05:59 UTC <zoomer46> @TheDemocrats @GOP @tizzywoman Unfortunately, I think this is true.
896368273914245120 2017-08-12 13:50:24 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JoyAnnReid @_____Heather_ I agree. If nothing else, this admin is very good at creating a diversion.
896355753442906112 2017-08-12 13:00:39 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Amy_Siskind I believe it was always about racism. All the rest was rubbish.
896355058010509314 2017-08-12 12:57:53 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Lara_Schwartz This is disturbing but I think this exposure galvanizes the left. We must pay close attention to this horrific movement.
896354415036293121 2017-08-12 12:55:20 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Jhenya_Belitsky Foreign policy needs a consistent, steadying hand. We probably will not get this type of policy from Trump.
896338517583855616 2017-08-12 11:52:10 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Marmel I love it that they are out from under their rocks. Exposes the ignorance and dangerous trend. Let us be ever vigilant.
896161148956835840 2017-08-11 00:07:22 UTC <zoomer46> @KatyTurNBC @POTUS @KellyO @margaritateresa Her motivation is power. All actions toward that end can, in her mind, be rationalized.

893940876417912832 2017-08-05 21:04:48 UTC <zoomer46> @bi_politics @PaladinCornelia each stupid decision hastens Trump's political demise..
893940411202514945 2017-08-05 21:02:57 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 you can use a backpack blower.

893264649855967233 2017-08-03 00:17:43 UTC <zoomer46> @InxsyS One can think that way when God is on your side.
893101903311253504 2017-08-03 13:31:01 UTC <zoomer46> @ryanlcooper gee. do you think it could be race?
893101504751693824 2017-08-03 13:29:26 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @SykesCharlie it will only be in monosyllabic words and most of them four letters so all will comprehend.
893101157765218305 2017-08-03 13:28:03 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @danpfeiffer let's see. trump must have been around 19 or 20 when the Cuban  missile crisis occurred. do you think he was too self centered to notice?
893100133734285312 2017-08-03 13:23:59 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa @Amy_Siskind Trump, you are such an incredible fake. I cannot think of a positive quality to describe you.
892859188837326848 2017-08-02 21:26:33 UTC <zoomer46> @khankiso There is something seriously wrong with Miller.
892856899821080577 2017-08-02 21:17:28 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 and you broke my camera
892132605273026563 2017-07-31 21:19:22 UTC <zoomer46> @RyanLizza @NoLiesLizzy @AngrierWHStaff in retrospect, Ryan Lizza deserves a trip to the vacation spot of his choice.
892124410798379013 2017-07-31 20:46:49 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Maybe he can't do the fandango.
892124198520467456 2017-07-31 20:45:58 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Yes.

891724021427056641 2017-07-30 18:15:48 UTC <zoomer46> @pattidan @ChrisMurphyCT This is such a sad development and unnecessary.  I feel for this family.
891617931708203008 2017-07-30 11:14:15 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa It won't take much to open the flood gates. 3 courageous votes make a good start. Kudos!

890873765902655488 2017-07-28 09:57:12 UTC <zoomer46> @Mike_P_Williams @margaritateresa I think it is important to never underestimate how low this POTUS will go just to get a win over Obama. It's all about that roast years ago.
890869270598602756 2017-07-28 09:39:20 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Mike_P_Williams It is obvious that Trump intends to torpedo the ACA.
890868582690803712 2017-07-28 09:36:36 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler A huge complicated program like ACA would need adjustments along the way. This is understandable.
890866924179124224 2017-07-28 09:30:00 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @GStuedler That is it in a nutshell,

886689766921707520 2017-07-16 20:51:28 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @rezaaslan Trump is still tweeting about Hilary. Laughable.
886689355645018112 2017-07-16 20:49:50 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @robreiner It is the only explanation that makes any sense at all. GOP was in on the the Russian complicity.
886688789594243072 2017-07-16 20:47:35 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Hypocrisy is not new to the GOP which has no moral ethic or code. GOP only cares about winning and losing now.
886649874095144961 2017-07-16 18:12:57 UTC <zoomer46> @gmarie55 @thehill    Criticism is based on an accurate assessment of her character.

879611675095203841 2017-06-27 08:05:40 UTC <zoomer46> @ActionTime The GOP has sold itself out and doesn't care what we think since they think they can purchase any election. We need to get out the vote.
879610857923239936 2017-06-27 08:02:25 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @stevenmnuchin1 This is a very strange picture.

879136244961341440 2017-06-25 00:36:29 UTC <zoomer46> @lilsister7 interesting thread.
879076110755123202 2017-06-25 20:37:31 UTC <zoomer46> @goldengateblond first he has to learn how to put his big boy pants on.

878701675044909057 2017-06-24 19:49:39 UTC <zoomer46> @slkavney @DavidWetherell she's out of her gourd
878701282604851200 2017-06-24 19:48:05 UTC <zoomer46> @brando5112 such persistence. never seen anything like it.
878682417535606785 2017-06-24 18:33:08 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 i hate when that happens
878681326005702657 2017-06-24 18:28:47 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 put a kiddie pool and sand in your living room
878558567917391873 2017-06-24 10:21:00 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX @Queeroolant it's going around

878549845954498560 2017-06-24 09:46:20 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX not capable of sympathy and just forget empathy
878548421153566720 2017-06-24 09:40:40 UTC <zoomer46> @CantWaitToNap This is very true.
878548095155527680 2017-06-24 09:39:23 UTC <zoomer46> @InxsyS Rarely have I seen such blatant self interest.
878545860333895680 2017-06-24 09:30:30 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ChrisMurphyCT This administration boldly lies as a matter of routine. Statements are lies unless proven otherwise.
878545218701860864 2017-06-24 09:27:57 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa It's always been about race.
878545049654624256 2017-06-24 09:27:17 UTC <zoomer46> @JohnJHarwood @margaritateresa @MichaelJDMurphy "fI I am going down I will take everyone with me."?
878544371955769344 2017-06-24 09:24:35 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JoeBiden This is not all that surprising given the recent stance of the GOP regarding the less than wealthy.
878544088626278402 2017-06-24 09:23:27 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa Here is a sure fire formula for honesty and integrity.
878396556382281728 2017-06-23 23:37:13 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan please. Do your stuff.
878368112227135488 2017-06-23 21:44:11 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @williamlegate Never seen anything like it. This guy will say anything that is convenient.
878367286817505280 2017-06-23 21:40:55 UTC <zoomer46> @HillaryClinton How can these people do this. Makes me wonder what happened to them as children.
878366804439171073 2017-06-23 21:39:00 UTC <zoomer46> @InxsyS don't pay attention to this guy. you make perfect sense to me.
878366095215874048 2017-06-23 21:36:11 UTC <zoomer46> @Solutioneer72 @TPM Trump doesn't know the meaning of irony.
878365737454153728 2017-06-23 21:34:45 UTC <zoomer46> @FiveThirtyEight @JumpTheRework @gabbertow did we really ever believe this pariah would help the little guy?
878365327523930113 2017-06-23 21:33:07 UTC <zoomer46> @Shareblue @ealight461 @AntiGOPActivist surprise. surprise. it was all a big scam.
878364357859606531 2017-06-23 21:29:16 UTC <zoomer46> @politicususa @khankiso Couldn't happen to a nicer party.
878363508437508097 2017-06-23 21:25:54 UTC <zoomer46> @carm2158 @DavidOAtkins That is a very good point. If he is talking, he is lying.
878063709935071233 2017-06-22 01:34:36 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @KellyannePolls  Something an adolescent would write.
877664652955660289 2017-06-21 23:08:54 UTC <zoomer46> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @hikergal333 glad he is not around to see this.
877641588113125377 2017-06-21 21:37:15 UTC <zoomer46> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @hikergal333 yup. no wait. a wall that seems to be the trend
877640633325830144 2017-06-21 21:33:27 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 hmm. this reminds me of the cable co.
877639504084877316 2017-06-21 21:28:58 UTC <zoomer46> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @hikergal333 we are going to build a chain link fence around it with concertina wire on top
877638418402082816 2017-06-21 21:24:39 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Stonekettle oh yes and we will quietly goose step along
877638142483935232 2017-06-21 21:23:33 UTC <zoomer46> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @hikergal333 omg. i am losing my mind.
877637294437523457 2017-06-21 21:20:11 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Stonekettle arrrrrgh. spare me that drivel.
877462445505343488 2017-06-21 09:45:24 UTC <zoomer46> @Stonekettle It would be a welcome surprise if McCain surprised us all.
877460949464121344 2017-06-21 09:39:27 UTC <zoomer46> @hikergal333 This is more than just a little disturbing.
877103374893813760 2017-06-20 09:58:35 UTC <zoomer46> @InxsyS maybe he is
876908988574519296 2017-06-19 21:06:09 UTC <zoomer46> @InxsyS ooh
876892252643184640 2017-06-19 19:59:39 UTC <zoomer46> @brando5112 This is a creepy development.
876891481872662530 2017-06-19 19:56:35 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 i already feel sorry.
876891098781712384 2017-06-19 19:55:04 UTC <zoomer46> @CampKayio Sad and horrible at the same time.
876890160637595648 2017-06-19 19:51:20 UTC <zoomer46> @InxsyS what is it
876889703928258560 2017-06-19 19:49:31 UTC <zoomer46> @brando5112 bunch of sheep
876889333164277761 2017-06-19 19:48:03 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic they may be trying to tell you something. mine didn't change...
876888492135124992 2017-06-19 19:44:42 UTC <zoomer46> @InxsyS wow. maybe we will never have to see either of them again.
876887840524730372 2017-06-19 19:42:07 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic uh oh. i didn't notice.

876429549227081730 2017-06-18 13:21:02 UTC <zoomer46> @carm2158 @donnabrazile misguided people in a dangerously stupid display of misdirected hatred.
876420664621707265 2017-06-18 12:45:44 UTC <zoomer46> @DeliliaOMalley ouch

876373115516989440 2017-06-18 09:36:47 UTC <zoomer46> @justabadazz Me too. Trump brings unethical and possibly illegal behavior to a brand new level.
876372626549166080 2017-06-18 09:34:51 UTC <zoomer46> @politicususa @margaritateresa @1Progressivism This guy is sharp

876366257183961088 2017-06-18 09:09:32 UTC <zoomer46> @LaineNola on my list!
876357934141374464 2017-06-18 08:36:28 UTC <zoomer46> @RDUCKRO Having a vegetable garden in the back yard is a huge step in the education our youth. Exposure to farm animals is also key.
876329944498024452 2017-06-17 06:45:14 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Never thought of that.
876226029253267458 2017-06-17 23:52:19 UTC <zoomer46> @ericgarland @NewYorker  This is good.

876186419332612096 2017-06-17 21:14:55 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Me too. I had confidence that all would be ok even if there were a few bumps in the road.
876183860157054976 2017-06-17 21:04:45 UTC <zoomer46> @OhNoSheTwitnt @CrothRoth17 This is so true.
876183444497235969 2017-06-17 21:03:06 UTC <zoomer46> @GeorgeTakei @CrothRoth17 Much of democracy requires faith in the system.
876145315480580098 2017-06-17 18:31:35 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic I like to imagine JC's reaction to this.
876141328559726592 2017-06-17 18:15:45 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @impeach_d_trump And headed for 70

876015163111092224 2017-06-17 09:54:25 UTC <zoomer46> @mattmfm This is unbelievable.
876014640030994432 2017-06-17 09:52:20 UTC <zoomer46> So it's not all about the bass. It's about the votes. Now igi.

876011164077043712 2017-06-17 09:38:31 UTC <zoomer46> @IMPL0RABLE @sobernhappy @realDonaldTrump  Or how about a dignified heartfelt well thought out statement.
876010213169664001 2017-06-17 09:34:44 UTC <zoomer46> @RupertMyers @gmarie55 @RoyalFamily  A truly touching any heartfelt message to a grieving nation. Kudos to the Queen.

875857600369373184 2017-06-16 23:28:19 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 This guy can't get out of his own way. Can you imagine the decisions he made when his dick still worked?

873659096418922498 2017-06-10 21:52:15 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc Never thought about going there before.
873658151702331392 2017-06-10 21:48:29 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc Would that be daytime highs?
873657946332434433 2017-06-10 21:47:40 UTC <zoomer46> @Stonekettle @SedLily @USMC_DD  Yes. This is the sign of some troubling times.

873601878562672644 2017-06-10 18:04:53 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic This kind of lunacy should be easy to defeat but...
873601516384509953 2017-06-10 18:03:26 UTC <zoomer46> @Harvard @anaelblog Interesting.
873598573639847936 2017-06-10 17:51:45 UTC <zoomer46> @Gilly_Murphy @hollylandes @DawnSwe12515208 @RLMS56  Yay for a rational thought process
873598360434946048 2017-06-10 17:50:54 UTC <zoomer46> @GeorgeTakei Because he doesn't know right from wrong.
873598070885318657 2017-06-10 17:49:45 UTC <zoomer46> @SallyAlbright @KattyKissem  This about nails it.

873592985086283776 2017-06-10 17:29:32 UTC <zoomer46> @SafetyPinDaily @margaritateresa @thehill  I noticed there is no wall in my town.

873592302584963073 2017-06-10 17:26:50 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @lloydblankfein  The wheels grind so slowly.
873592174981599233 2017-06-10 17:26:19 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @thehill I can only imagine.
873581152333946880 2017-06-10 16:42:31 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc Looks way different than I thought. Thanks. Great pictures.

872771489245822976 2017-06-08 11:05:13 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa I agree. He is a grifter displaying his latest shell game and his reptilian mind seems to know what he is doing.
872770984264294401 2017-06-08 11:03:12 UTC <zoomer46> @slkavney @sarahkendzior It will have interactive touch screens to view his journey into lunacy via his tweets.

872181031314620416 2017-06-06 19:58:56 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler This is true. Why waste an accusation without a subpoena and a court of law?.

857185428939694080 2017-04-26 10:51:46 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @thehill Let's stop trying to finance this idiotic wall and place these resources elsewhere.
857006224637820928 2017-04-25 22:59:41 UTC <zoomer46> @kylegriffin1 @LorenzoQ  And now we have a reckless president who thinks he is above the law.
856962667889786880 2017-04-25 20:06:36 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa @patrickfcox_cox I expect not.
856962186157191172 2017-04-25 20:04:41 UTC <zoomer46> @joshuamanning23 @peterbakernyt  You're kidding.
856960748966342657 2017-04-25 19:58:58 UTC <zoomer46> @RVAwonk @CharlotJeff Details. Details.
856960041584349186 2017-04-25 19:56:10 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa Is it necessary to alienate every country on the planet?
856958969092485120 2017-04-25 19:51:54 UTC <zoomer46> @dailykos @co_rapunzel4 Every time Sessions opens his mouth he shows what an ignoramus he is.
856933848948633600 2017-04-25 18:12:05 UTC <zoomer46> nice view

856929065223286784 2017-04-25 17:53:04 UTC <zoomer46> @CarlaMoulton3 @margaritateresa @JoyAnnReid  The disturbing thing is that so many want to believe his lies. The lies back up their ignorance
856928483494289410 2017-04-25 17:50:46 UTC <zoomer46> @whaleerules88 @margaritateresa @JoyAnnReid  I think most US politicians will back whoever they think will help them get reelected.
856926484832940032 2017-04-25 17:42:49 UTC <zoomer46> @RBReich @voxdotcom  It would be nice if Trump became unhinged and didn't cause any more damage but the two might go hand in hand.
856922468866510848 2017-04-25 17:26:52 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid Trump and these two shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath.
856921844368146433 2017-04-25 17:24:23 UTC <zoomer46> @SenatorBurr @DMansini @RawStory  The Germans know how to treat a hypocrite.
856921612016398336 2017-04-25 17:23:27 UTC <zoomer46> @KeithOlbermann @maddow @TheMinistryOfUS @thehill  Trump admin has no respect for due process and thinks it's above the law.
856850502499348482 2017-04-25 12:40:53 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Amy_Siskind Ivanka is used to getting away with verbal murder. She needs to be contfronted more often. Her dad too.
856825110069641216 2017-04-25 10:59:59 UTC <zoomer46> @RhapsodysBIues @KevinMKruse Oh right and the slaves (human beings) were just collateral damage of a flawed economic system?

856616140470185985 2017-04-24 21:09:37 UTC <zoomer46> @ValerieOMcVey Sadly, this may be over the heads of the people at which it is directed.
856615608502374400 2017-04-24 21:07:30 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @BrianPaulStuart One brick at a time.

856614644982714368 2017-04-24 21:03:41 UTC <zoomer46> @thehill @NCStillWithHer   Trump is delusional.

856260958150422528 2017-04-23 21:38:15 UTC <zoomer46> @morgansher There is nothing more permanent than something temporary
856258617678454785 2017-04-23 21:28:57 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JoyAnnReid grr. auto correct. LIAR not lawyer. but I guess the first post is true. I better eat something.
856256889881067521 2017-04-23 21:22:05 UTC <zoomer46> @TPM @DarrellIssa @buffaloon I say Trump and Darrell Issa deserve each other.
856256340892712961 2017-04-23 21:19:54 UTC <zoomer46> @GOP @Amy_Siskind did Paul Ryan slip or was this intentional?

856254451212058625 2017-04-23 21:12:24 UTC <zoomer46> @DaShanneStokes @margaritateresa that's true if they can do it to them they can do it to you
856254068444078082 2017-04-23 21:10:53 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid @margaritateresa A really good lawyer has to have a terrific memory this guy does not have one

855385270295949312 2017-04-21 11:38:35 UTC <zoomer46> @awkwardlyours now i get it.

855092657571467266 2017-04-20 16:15:51 UTC <zoomer46> @LawyersComm I wondered when Colin Powell would exact his revenge.
855091144451117057 2017-04-20 16:09:50 UTC <zoomer46> @keatingthomas @margaritateresa  All Fox has to do is hang out in a trailer park. They'll find someone to spew hate and ignorance.
855090182189707264 2017-04-20 16:06:00 UTC <zoomer46> @awkwardlyours You started that joke a long time ago.
855089380192657412 2017-04-20 16:02:49 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic He's white. He's rich. He's a misogynist. A formula for success within the GOP. What could go wrong?

854805712056315906 2017-04-19 21:15:37 UTC <zoomer46> @paraempathetic @TeaPainUSA There is a future for O'Reilly in politics. Maybe he should be the GOP candidate in 2020. They seem to like this sort of ilk.
854804744585584640 2017-04-19 21:11:47 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @maddow Tillerson has no shame. Or conscience. Doesn't matter what personality flaw is causing it. Greed will do us in one day. Not Iraq or N Korea.

854802830837915654 2017-04-19 21:04:10 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @TheRickyDavila Maybe he thought these despicable tenets could actually be used as building blocks.
854802357082890241 2017-04-19 21:02:18 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler Trump making America take a back seat again.

854744039526158338 2017-04-19 17:10:34 UTC <zoomer46> @MtnMD @margaritateresa @GudlaugHawkinso he can do the newt thing and make a ton lobbying. then he can be the real whore he wants to be.
854741241313079297 2017-04-19 16:59:26 UTC <zoomer46> @KatyTurNBC @jyester55 @PrincessBravato so does this administration lie as policy or is there a reason for aircraftcarriergate.

854725995512954881 2017-04-19 15:58:52 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc great audio depiction. kudos to you creativity.
854723197178191872 2017-04-19 15:47:44 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @MtnMD Jason Chaffetz has prostituted himself to the dark forces of the Republican Party. There will be a special place in Hell for him.
854722469588078594 2017-04-19 15:44:51 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Backstorymom1 Apparently this is Trump's idea of making America Great Again.

854503263185588224 2017-04-18 01:13:48 UTC <zoomer46> @TVietor08 @margaritateresa @SopanDeb so in trump's bizarro world everythin that's up is down and everything that's left is right.

854467797472227328 2017-04-18 22:52:52 UTC <zoomer46> @NBCNews @margaritateresa @LawyerRogelio Of course it doesn't
854465315916234752 2017-04-18 22:43:01 UTC <zoomer46> So the "Armada" was headed toward Australia? You can' make this shit up.
854264885861130240 2017-04-18 09:26:34 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa @azmoderate Interesting.
854143355571318785 2017-04-17 01:23:39 UTC <zoomer46> @politicususa @margaritateresa  Embarrass and make these morons uncomfortable so they have to go back under the rocks from whence they came.
854142119019253765 2017-04-17 01:18:45 UTC <zoomer46> @Ricka168 @margaritateresa  My own brother succumbed to the poor me white mentality. Stop blaming others, Bud.
854138640838139904 2017-04-17 01:04:55 UTC <zoomer46> @4SLars @fuzzlime You can stop this now before it becomes a trend again but it will require discipline and self control.
854137874379407360 2017-04-17 01:01:53 UTC <zoomer46> it won't be Russia, N Korea or Iran. It will be Greed that eventually defeats us.
854135355859140608 2017-04-17 00:51:52 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @davidfrum Wait a minute. They screwed up an Easter Egg Roll? Unprecedented.

853677882887032833 2017-04-16 18:34:02 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid @EvelynNiessner It's hard to believe this cretin is what they wanted.
853672669534969857 2017-04-16 18:13:19 UTC <zoomer46> @EvelynNiessner @JoyAnnReid The frat boys take over the world. Good Lord. Where did we go wrong? Shame on us for not seeing the coming of this BS.
853670281495412736 2017-04-16 18:03:50 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Evan_McMullin It's obvious Trump has much to hide. What else could it mean? An honest person when asked for numbers provides more data than is necessary.
853614825322237953 2017-04-16 14:23:28 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Mikel_Jollett Trump's tax returns probably are much too illuminating to be released. His ties to nefarious organizations would be damning and he knows it
853613712284016641 2017-04-16 14:19:03 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ezlusztig It is obvious that Trump has never read the US Constitution. He really ought to. It's a mighty fine document written by intelligent men.
853565359772884992 2017-04-16 11:06:54 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @TrueFactsStated These indictments and the subsequent testimonies should be enlightening. I am looking forward to it.

853306402873495553 2017-04-15 17:57:54 UTC <zoomer46> @suejohnston56 @Micah0118 You can't tell me that there is not retribution for immoral politicians like this. There has to be.
853305966900760577 2017-04-15 17:56:10 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Oh right. He wrote the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I guess that was on Moses's third tablet.
853304924347695104 2017-04-15 17:52:02 UTC <zoomer46> @THE_ECB Why would a woman oppose Title 9? I am at a loss.
853302173215674375 2017-04-15 17:41:06 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid War sure is fun if you think it's a video game. Men with arrested development and no concept of cause and effect.
853198902492889088 2017-04-15 10:50:44 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 I think they were raised by greedy soulless monsters.
852999145673674754 2017-04-14 21:36:58 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic I did.
852998675265724416 2017-04-14 21:35:06 UTC <zoomer46> @leahmcelrath @Braveswyn @DonaldJTrumpJr   Gee. Couldn't we have hit them with something bigger? Wasn't there a father of all bombs?
852998037957988352 2017-04-14 21:32:34 UTC <zoomer46> @GeorgeTakei @buffaloon   From a historical standpoint this is an astounding development.
852637714138755072 2017-04-13 21:40:46 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @robreiner All the distractions in the world cannot change the Russian election interference. It happened and needs to be investigated independently.
852267152648359937 2017-04-12 21:08:18 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Jimmyspolitics Instead of helping him run the elevator someone should teach him how to run it.
852198893081251840 2017-04-12 16:37:03 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JoyAnnReid Hyperbole? This would be fun if it weren't so scary.
852110815633256448 2017-04-12 10:47:04 UTC <zoomer46> @AndreaChalupa And Ivanka was such a nice kid.
851908563094171648 2017-04-11 21:23:23 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @politico Why are we surprised when this man lies about something? Be shocked if I ever hear the truth.
851575780924674048 2017-04-10 23:21:02 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JackSmithIV We live in a very strange world.
850336336611553280 2017-04-07 13:15:55 UTC <zoomer46> @OutOnTheMoors @bklynmike3 We better monitor North Korea very carefully. They have to be nervous after the Syrian attack.
850121441718800388 2017-04-06 23:02:00 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic More like Nine and a Half Weeks of...
850106155665944576 2017-04-06 22:01:16 UTC <zoomer46> This is outstanding. I am so happy for him.
849927273650294784 2017-04-06 10:10:27 UTC <zoomer46> @brycecovert @GStuedler Another example of Trump's disdain for the ordinary citizen.
849926006492327937 2017-04-06 10:05:25 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @jayman758 I think O'Reilly's sphincter is already winking...Something is winking. Not sure what it is. Maybe he and Bannon can run off together.
849908027364913157 2017-04-06 08:53:58 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Checks and balances. checks and balances. its a fine thing.
849891574574141440 2017-04-06 07:48:36 UTC <zoomer46> @johnrobertsFox @margaritateresa @TomNamako Bannon couldn't see that Trump had to be the main attraction?
849891205928415232 2017-04-06 07:47:08 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @rawan Ivanka's tears regarding Syria are too little, too late.
849887174904426497 2017-04-06 07:31:07 UTC <zoomer46> @TheRickyDavila I believe Bannon will eventually be ousted completely. Even Trump will see that his policies are a political disaster.
849749998015320064 2017-04-05 22:26:01 UTC <zoomer46> @khankiso @jbendery McCain sort of ruminates but seems to have a tendency to cave. Am I right?
849749244739284994 2017-04-05 22:23:02 UTC <zoomer46> @OutOnTheMoors @PastaFace2 Oh boy. What a devious thought. Pure genius.
849713470476103685 2017-04-05 20:00:52 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan oh yes. the whole admin has been nothing but a song and dance routine.
849713214329892867 2017-04-05 19:59:51 UTC <zoomer46> @fireflywriter These wheels grind soooo slowly.
849701892741627904 2017-04-05 19:14:52 UTC <zoomer46> @dmillerwats @deanofcomedy Trump will be on the wrong side of the fence every time.
849681006072410114 2017-04-05 17:51:52 UTC <zoomer46> @nikkipack1 @DavidCornDC Are we surprised Trump defends Bill O'Reilly?

849603528595308544 2017-04-05 12:44:00 UTC <zoomer46> @neilpX @InSpiteOfTrump He should have signed it on equal pay day, surprised he didn't think of that.
849602196324876293 2017-04-05 12:38:43 UTC <zoomer46> @InvictusDad @Rrrocambolesco Ok. I think I am ready.

849591197588795392 2017-04-05 11:55:00 UTC <zoomer46> @solusnan1 Is there not one decent person in the Trump family? Are they all grifters?
849556075783352320 2017-04-05 09:35:27 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @yashar I guess she is trying to make an impression. Speaks volumes.
849555603609591817 2017-04-05 09:33:34 UTC <zoomer46> @JeannieG40 You can do this.

849391872103653382 2017-04-04 22:42:57 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan GOP is a collection of misguided, myopic, malignant, morons. Has a nice ring to it.

849361398551465984 2017-04-04 20:41:52 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa I have noticed that often times people with the most confidence have no reason to have that characteristic. Why is that?
849360311857672192 2017-04-04 20:37:33 UTC <zoomer46> @neilpX @AstroKatie Trump is a man who missed the critical thinking unit in high school.

846705931454951424 2017-03-28 12:49:59 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @FullFrontalSamB I really think disdain and humor will eventually take down the Republican Party.
846705387214700544 2017-03-28 12:47:49 UTC <zoomer46> @khankiso Shameless. Has no conscience.

846676954317238273 2017-03-28 10:54:51 UTC <zoomer46> Having coffee listening to the shrimp boats go out to the Gulf. Life goes on.

846459984011558916 2017-03-27 20:32:41 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX I am sure it was even better than a Hallmark card. You continue to inspire me.
846418790413950976 2017-03-27 17:48:59 UTC <zoomer46> @GingerHotDish @Wine_Honey1  Take a page out the the current playbook and make her your running mate.
846390498680037378 2017-03-27 15:56:34 UTC <zoomer46> @SenGillibrand What could justify this move. I don't get it.
846347595496738816 2017-03-27 13:06:05 UTC <zoomer46> @leftyjennyc Not a very intelligent way to win someone over. I don't get it.
846322250395586561 2017-03-27 11:25:23 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @NastyNastyVet POTUS does not even come close to instilling confidence or being inspirational.

846099401756098563 2017-03-26 20:39:51 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler Well. You know the old saying...when good men...
846098536483770368 2017-03-26 20:36:25 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler I personally think this kind of collateral damage is unacceptable.
846093763541897218 2017-03-26 20:17:27 UTC <zoomer46> @ananavarro I will not rest until this charlatan is out of the WH.

846005260221108224 2017-03-26 14:25:46 UTC <zoomer46> @girlsreallyrule In no way can this be considered productive and in the interest of the common good.
845992250672922625 2017-03-26 13:34:04 UTC <zoomer46> @CantWaitToNap @funnyaries0418 Yes. A time honored equation.

845936672818761728 2017-03-26 09:53:14 UTC <zoomer46> @mrderrick_ @JasonKander inspiration. A person or thing that inspires.
845911501542211585 2017-03-26 08:13:12 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @markpiesner We need more in depth reporting about ACA.
845776484673503232 2017-03-25 23:16:42 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Kimryn She could take up bowling.
845776162873839616 2017-03-25 23:15:25 UTC <zoomer46> @Hell_HasCome @margaritateresa @MSNBC  Trump really has exposed the ugly underbelly of the Right.
845775640565616642 2017-03-25 23:13:21 UTC <zoomer46> @Stonekettle @margaritateresa @FoxNews  What a mind job.
845774476893675520 2017-03-25 23:08:43 UTC <zoomer46> @funder @margaritateresa  Honesty.
845774179676966914 2017-03-25 23:07:32 UTC <zoomer46> @Kimryn @margaritateresa  Really. Can you blame her?
845774037808754688 2017-03-25 23:06:58 UTC <zoomer46> @impeach_d_trump @margaritateresa  I would love to see Trump take the high road. Just once.
845773512400916481 2017-03-25 23:04:53 UTC <zoomer46> @StephenKing @margaritateresa Right. Who needs drinking water.
845613347957559296 2017-03-25 12:28:27 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @sethmoulton I hate when I win all the time. It makes me crazy.
845613108903247872 2017-03-25 12:27:30 UTC <zoomer46> @TimAlberta @margaritateresa @ezlusztig Trump takes broad stroke guy to a new level.
845585561029148673 2017-03-25 10:38:02 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @subzerov690 Russia is the main event.
845585219260481536 2017-03-25 10:36:41 UTC <zoomer46> @LeeKowal Wait a minute. Your own party defeated it.
845574031248179200 2017-03-25 09:52:13 UTC <zoomer46> @LouiseMensch @margaritateresa @Blairsden The wheels may not grind as slowly as I thought.

845402767275503617 2017-03-24 22:31:41 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa Wall. What wall. I never said I would build a wall. FAKE media. SAD.
845392114351591424 2017-03-24 21:49:21 UTC <zoomer46> @meow2438 @hippiemama2002 Sometimes it is not a good idea to brag about your business skills in a political environment.
845389753960861696 2017-03-24 21:39:58 UTC <zoomer46> @NorthBayTeky @DavidCornDC Good question. Why is he there?
845387343754399744 2017-03-24 21:30:23 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan resistance is working
845376433644081152 2017-03-24 20:47:02 UTC <zoomer46> The Russian/Trump investigation proceeds and it is important to keep your eye on the prize.
845373850795884544 2017-03-24 20:36:46 UTC <zoomer46> Good won over evil today but let's not gloat. Move on to the next fight with a clear head.
845258183925026816 2017-03-24 12:57:09 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @SenSchumer Welcome to the world of the Grand Old Party.

845257567374905344 2017-03-24 12:54:42 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @brianklaas The closer.
845058534962335744 2017-03-23 23:43:49 UTC <zoomer46> @USATODAY @Specneedsmom4 Rick Perry is a complete Bozo.
845057360536244225 2017-03-23 23:39:09 UTC <zoomer46> @lavenderblue27 @JoyAnnReid @margaritateresa I will never understand this fixation on other people's private lives.
845055426454540289 2017-03-23 23:31:28 UTC <zoomer46> @lavenderblue27 @JoyAnnReid @margaritateresa I mean really, whether someone is gay or not is not on my radar.
845055028725452800 2017-03-23 23:29:53 UTC <zoomer46> @lavenderblue27 @JoyAnnReid @margaritateresa Really. Who has time to even consider this shit.
845054642501373957 2017-03-23 23:28:21 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @CharlesMBlow Good. It is time to put a stop to this madness.
845054305614905344 2017-03-23 23:27:01 UTC <zoomer46> @davidmackau @brontyman @margaritateresa Another understated British response.
845053720043892738 2017-03-23 23:24:41 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @erikaheidewald Republicans are at polar ends of their political spectrum and  do not foresee them coming together.
845036574391914496 2017-03-23 22:16:34 UTC <zoomer46> @RepAdamSchiff @BlueStateBob1 @ItizBiz Nunes has to go. He is either clueless or dishonest. Either trait makes him untrustworthy.
845018386891493378 2017-03-23 21:04:17 UTC <zoomer46> Yes. All Ryan needs is a few more days to get it right. Ryan is a soulless cretin.https://twitter.com/TheRickyDavila/status/845007859100323841
845016754300604416 2017-03-23 20:57:48 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler Sorry. I don't think an apology is going to be quite enough.
845016534078631936 2017-03-23 20:56:56 UTC <zoomer46> @JessikaJayne @JasonLeMiere Where do you even find people like this?
845014251400019972 2017-03-23 20:47:51 UTC <zoomer46> i feel good.pic.twitter.com/v1EVYFu9Sg
845012036971102208 2017-03-23 20:39:03 UTC <zoomer46> @joshuamanning23 Yes. So he can play in the sand this weekend in FL.
845011800156504064 2017-03-23 20:38:07 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @3DTruth I am hoping that this POTUS will never get his legislative agenda going. No wait. Does he even have a plan?
845007147167633408 2017-03-23 20:19:38 UTC <zoomer46> So the House Republicans need some more time to work on their plan. I guess 7 yrs wasn't enough time to get it right.
845006572308836353 2017-03-23 20:17:20 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler I guess the jugular would be redundant then but it would be fun.
845005979813072897 2017-03-23 20:14:59 UTC <zoomer46> @theClaudiaInez I think the press should show up with water pistols and spray him every time he misbehaves.
845004586171748352 2017-03-23 20:09:27 UTC <zoomer46> @RepAdamSchiff @snowakowski4574 @POTUS   What a week. I think I'll go to Florida.
845004206641741825 2017-03-23 20:07:56 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 @jeffscottmendo1  He should just be quiet and learn to listen for six months.
845003208170897412 2017-03-23 20:03:58 UTC <zoomer46> @politico @GStuedler That's a start. It's almost time to go for the jugular.
844998511640883200 2017-03-23 19:45:19 UTC <zoomer46> @DanRather @margaritateresa   We can only think of our Savior that they do not know what they are doing.
844998308481265664 2017-03-23 19:44:30 UTC <zoomer46> @dumptrump33 @margaritateresa @realDonaldTrump  Me too. This is almost as fun as Nixon. No. It's better.
844997794150649856 2017-03-23 19:42:28 UTC <zoomer46> @brhodes @margaritateresa @lrozen  Either he is unethical or amoral. Guess it doesn't matter.
844997090799431682 2017-03-23 19:39:40 UTC <zoomer46> @jaketapper @margaritateresa @BrianPSmyth  How dumb is that. Kind of like the double negative thing.

844988271377747968 2017-03-23 19:04:37 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan What's missing here is common human decency.
844986558763732993 2017-03-23 18:57:49 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan So a single mother with three kids pays for day care, works for minimum wage, and nets minus figures? What planet is he on?
844985542697766912 2017-03-23 18:53:47 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa Yup. It was okay as long as it was not them.
844984911069151232 2017-03-23 18:51:16 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 Oh yes. They have it coming.

844675268237242371 2017-03-22 22:20:51 UTC <zoomer46> @segmentis @JohnJHarwood I wonder if the chair ever stopped and thought to do "the right thing". Too much to ask?
844671319434235911 2017-03-22 22:05:10 UTC <zoomer46> @jupiter896 This exploits a lot. Not exactly good news for the WH.
844655434896228356 2017-03-22 21:02:03 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @SenSchumer We shall see tomorrow who has the courage and moral integrity to say no to this ill conceived health car bill.

843824771490025472 2017-03-20 14:01:17 UTC <zoomer46> @Ange_Amene A unified Democratic Party would be a huge advantage by the time the mid terms come around.
843823965940387840 2017-03-20 13:58:05 UTC <zoomer46> @StevenTDennis @margaritateresa Remember how W's ratings soared after (I hesitate to say it) 9/11.

843819514869497858 2017-03-20 13:40:24 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ikebarinholtz Once you enter the public arena things are just not the same. Seems like a surprise to many people.

842883147305951233 2017-03-17 23:39:36 UTC <zoomer46> The presidential ratings are low now. If he decides to attack North Korea one of the reasons will be to improve his ratings.

840334501859471362 2017-03-10 22:52:12 UTC <zoomer46> @sarah1mc @ash4funnygirl  You are not invisible.
840333916582084609 2017-03-10 22:49:53 UTC <zoomer46> @sarah1mc @ash4funnygirl  That's a good start. I like it.
840333229303451649 2017-03-10 22:47:09 UTC <zoomer46> @Lola_Just_Lola  It's important to be good at something.
840317279116132356 2017-03-10 21:43:46 UTC <zoomer46> @laughingliberal  Yes. And we did it slowly.
840316479912460292 2017-03-10 21:40:35 UTC <zoomer46> @SeiYoung83 @Inferno_V  Yup.
840313940945059840 2017-03-10 21:30:30 UTC <zoomer46> @TraderJones2011 @EileenMPOPP @GOP @SophieInCT  This just gets more amazing every day.
840313277380988928 2017-03-10 21:27:52 UTC <zoomer46> @WineMummy @AtticusFinch79 I think it happens early tomorrow morning.
840312769870233607 2017-03-10 21:25:51 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX @AP_Politics scares the hell out of me.
840307952363941888 2017-03-10 21:06:42 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind @FireMonkee  Don't hold your breath.
840307571521138688 2017-03-10 21:05:11 UTC <zoomer46> @1followernodad @yenniwhite  You are probably correct he says from behind d the refrigerator.
840306888122224640 2017-03-10 21:02:28 UTC <zoomer46> @artemis1954 @citizengatsby @terrij68 @ddale8  That would make my day.
840306590637015044 2017-03-10 21:01:18 UTC <zoomer46> @margbrennan @joshrogin nice try rex
840306112658309121 2017-03-10 20:59:24 UTC <zoomer46> @terrij68 @solusnan1 @costareports Good Lord
840304476015775744 2017-03-10 20:52:53 UTC <zoomer46> @Karoli @EnarDavis1 @JoyAnnReid @maddow Oh I see. Maybe those ex state people can pick our fruits and vegetables.
840295735958614020 2017-03-10 20:18:10 UTC <zoomer46> @clindsaysway that's sweet.
840294950034128902 2017-03-10 20:15:02 UTC <zoomer46> @SwirlySkittles @WineMummy i hate that neighborhood. i won't go there alone.
840294597905514497 2017-03-10 20:13:38 UTC <zoomer46> @SwirlySkittles @WineMummy It's like not getting stoned one day and saying "hey this is nice".
840279118847578112 2017-03-10 19:12:08 UTC <zoomer46> @SwirlySkittles @thebeckyard It's kind of like milk and cereal.
840274453934329857 2017-03-10 18:53:36 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie @giavos It's a secret cry for help.
840262241249292291 2017-03-10 18:05:04 UTC <zoomer46> @kylegriffin1 @titodinzey @Shyempress Pretty soon there will be an initiation fee.
840260797917986821 2017-03-10 17:59:20 UTC <zoomer46> @doktorj Finally. Proof.
840256901992595460 2017-03-10 17:43:51 UTC <zoomer46> @lisaxy424 me too. i am often misunderstood but then again maybe the sarcasm font won't help.
840253718406803462 2017-03-10 17:31:12 UTC <zoomer46> @ddsmidt @literally_is_me ooh. can i play?
840250983015952384 2017-03-10 17:20:20 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 It's Friday? All day?
840250769978851329 2017-03-10 17:19:29 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu Subcutaneous microchips would be next. Seriously, we are not far from this.
840217267799482369 2017-03-10 15:06:21 UTC <zoomer46> @mommywhitfield yes and buying hammers and lurking in home depot looking for a pair of pliers.
840181207149268992 2017-03-10 12:43:04 UTC <zoomer46> @ladistardust @royagraham Good Lord. It's a pool. You join. You pay. You hope you don't win.
840017026538188801 2017-03-09 01:50:40 UTC <zoomer46> @CarrieMayhem @PwrFulWmn how could you
840015697698836481 2017-03-09 01:45:23 UTC <zoomer46> @JRobb773 @heatherlou_ I would have babbled more
840015392709980161 2017-03-09 01:44:11 UTC <zoomer46> @perfect_messs they would be easy to replace before you got home.
840013895741902848 2017-03-09 01:38:14 UTC <zoomer46> @AimeeHelene1 @mommywhitfield I'll do it.
840013100359307265 2017-03-09 01:35:04 UTC <zoomer46> @PoutyPink @mommywhitfield good god. What were you thinking?
839965326791999488 2017-03-09 22:25:14 UTC <zoomer46> @Ummm_Nope_ @Jarhead44 It's working.
839956233746595841 2017-03-09 21:49:06 UTC <zoomer46> @SexytotheNorth @dani_goner Ring finger first, then crotch. It's a sequential problem.
839953076362575873 2017-03-09 21:36:33 UTC <zoomer46> @Cutler_econ @itb32157 @genebsperling Wish I could be a fly on the wall when these Trump supporters first open their health insurance bills.
839950556240171009 2017-03-09 21:26:32 UTC <zoomer46> @NickKristof @nytimes @StageYaneu @funder If it quacks like a duck...
839849376793120768 2017-03-09 14:44:29 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Amy_Siskind So it is important to hold off the GOP until the 2018 midterms.
839786128643407872 2017-03-09 10:33:10 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa @StafferWh These guys are right on top of things.
839782328998195200 2017-03-09 10:18:04 UTC <zoomer46> @SenTedCruz @BrianPaulStuart My goodness. With all that is going on I forgot about this. Seems like years ago.
839781696471982080 2017-03-09 10:15:33 UTC <zoomer46> @rickyc183 I am inclined to agree but the result is a smokescreen. This is a reptilian survival mechanism.
839640153291427840 2017-03-08 00:53:06 UTC <zoomer46> @HawaiiDelilah Works for me.
839614633996607488 2017-03-08 23:11:42 UTC <zoomer46> @solusnan1 @traciemom Trumpcare. Trumpcare. Trumpcare. Trumpcare.  Trumpcare. Trumpcare. Trumpcare.
839609005060329477 2017-03-08 22:49:20 UTC <zoomer46> @solusnan1 I think it has already happened.
839607440912101376 2017-03-08 22:43:07 UTC <zoomer46> @ddsmidt @StellaGMaddox I'll have to try that.
839607311626866690 2017-03-08 22:42:36 UTC <zoomer46> @solusnan1 It's going to happen. The wheels grind slowly.
839601746657882116 2017-03-08 22:20:30 UTC <zoomer46> @PoliticusSarah In addition to all his other fine qualifications he can now add pimp to his resume.
839586021109035010 2017-03-08 21:18:00 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie @TPM Oh wow. He has put his foot in it now.
839583401392947201 2017-03-08 21:07:36 UTC <zoomer46> @merewillis @Luminousoul_ Seems like that never goes away.
839581605924593666 2017-03-08 21:00:28 UTC <zoomer46> @Mom_Overboard @SwirlySkittles Don't quote me or Believe me or I'm just saying.
839575098034094081 2017-03-08 20:34:36 UTC <zoomer46> @guardian @badgirl_loony So now he's a pump. Sort of found his niche.
839574534785236994 2017-03-08 20:32:22 UTC <zoomer46> @politicususa @TracyCh86248594 I have rarely seen such incompetence caused by a lack of direction at the top.
839559922811604995 2017-03-08 19:34:18 UTC <zoomer46> @Luminousoul_ @perfect_messs Just slip out the back.
839555647612010496 2017-03-08 19:17:19 UTC <zoomer46> @bobcesca_go @keithboykin Big surprise.
839549981086400513 2017-03-08 18:54:48 UTC <zoomer46> @PressSec @TheSwissK That would be a message from God.
839549274752966656 2017-03-08 18:51:59 UTC <zoomer46> @NotSoNiceMommy @SexytotheNorth it's my fault
839549047979577346 2017-03-08 18:51:05 UTC <zoomer46> @Sophie2078 @Lola_Just_Lola don't do it.
839547765147504640 2017-03-08 18:45:59 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie @sancusbook And debtors prisons. Or is that redundant?
839546510421422082 2017-03-08 18:41:00 UTC <zoomer46> @pbpost @Limeylizzie oh boy
839545611464638464 2017-03-08 18:37:26 UTC <zoomer46> @dailykos @Heinzilla Some people are just vile. Don't care why any more.
839544736142802947 2017-03-08 18:33:57 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @laurenduca Even a blind pig will find an acorn.
839544213008236545 2017-03-08 18:31:53 UTC <zoomer46> @d_kollat @SwirlySkittles yes. I was.
839434278932865024 2017-03-08 11:15:02 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa I really think we are in dangerous uncharted political waters.
839432220687364096 2017-03-08 11:06:51 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler These people are beyond screwed up.
839431820840157185 2017-03-08 11:05:16 UTC <zoomer46> @GStuedler you're kidding.
839431111830798336 2017-03-08 11:02:27 UTC <zoomer46> @NPR @GStuedler @margaritateresa I didn't believe it at first but I am now sure we have white supremacists advising a clueless POTUS
839429937060794368 2017-03-08 10:57:47 UTC <zoomer46> @NPR @margaritateresa @GStuedler It doesn't matter. Bannon and Miller want a white Christian America. That's the naked truth.
839427585834639360 2017-03-08 10:48:26 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @butwhyevernot This man's arrogance and disdain for people is appalling. He has no business to be in public office.
839112644992860160 2017-03-07 13:56:59 UTC <zoomer46> @LeonardGreene @JamilSmith @margaritateresa Good Lord.
839112530790318080 2017-03-07 13:56:31 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @paulwaldman1 Why don't they just admit that they want a white Christian America. Where does that leave me?
839111310231109632 2017-03-07 13:51:40 UTC <zoomer46> @LeonardGreene @margaritateresa @JamilSmith This has brought ignorance to a new level.
839111060804206592 2017-03-07 13:50:41 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Amy_Siskind The gold star parent travel review needs to get more attention. If they can do it to him they can do it to you
839094941003436034 2017-03-07 12:46:38 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa This guy need to experience the unemployment line.
839093296366497793 2017-03-07 12:40:06 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @brianstelter No evidence. Counting on the hill to do nothing. Admin wants this false charge to fester.
839086197083357184 2017-03-07 12:11:53 UTC <zoomer46> @mjclark21 @joshuamanning23 @leeace1966 @monkeyaunt1950 @vidalmayraa @Loloben63 @margaritateresa Vote to stop the madness.
839085524908445697 2017-03-07 12:09:13 UTC <zoomer46> @SikhFeminist There is a wave of unchecked cruelty, ignorance and bigotry sweeping across the nation. It saddens me deeply.
839082951518347265 2017-03-07 11:58:59 UTC <zoomer46> @impeach_d_trump @margaritateresa It should be out in the open. Bannon is a sick, damaged man who wants to take the whole New Deal down.
839081065289560064 2017-03-07 11:51:29 UTC <zoomer46> @impeach_d_trump @margaritateresa And I am beginning to think the destruction of everything we hold dear is what this admin wants.
839080289649455105 2017-03-07 11:48:25 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Amy_Siskind Everyone has to get out to vote. The republic's survival depends on it.
839079922534604800 2017-03-07 11:46:57 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @impeach_d_trump We have to remove this ilk before they take down the whole republic.
838866296527794176 2017-03-06 21:38:05 UTC <zoomer46> @washingtonpost @HawaiiDelilah This type of privileged personality makes a career out of avoiding the constraints of normal society.
838746164551892992 2017-03-06 13:40:43 UTC <zoomer46> @SarahHuckabee @kylegriffin1 At this point I don't believe anything coming out of the WH.
838567816953475075 2017-03-05 01:52:02 UTC <zoomer46> @Lonestarmomcom @shellyhawthorne @maggieNYT Trump should be having electro shock therapy twice a week.
838566919225638914 2017-03-05 01:48:28 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind @costareports Trump has been manipulating the media for forty years. In NYC he used to call Stern under an assumed name.
838531394120876032 2017-03-05 23:27:18 UTC <zoomer46> @BaronBavis @PaladinCornelia angry old white guy.
838503886956683266 2017-03-05 21:37:59 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 you reap what you sow mf ers
838496071949160450 2017-03-05 21:06:56 UTC <zoomer46> @FionaGillen2013 @RepSwalwell Wasn't there a game called whack a mole.
838409944831512577 2017-03-05 15:24:42 UTC <zoomer46> I don't know about you but I keep a list.
838398641471688705 2017-03-05 14:39:47 UTC <zoomer46> @shellyhawthorne Really well said.
838367137672626176 2017-03-05 12:34:36 UTC <zoomer46> @BillKristol It's not all that difficult to get to the truth of the matter.
838325782720172032 2017-03-05 09:50:16 UTC <zoomer46> @JumpTheRework @ericgarland Time after time it's all about not getting caught. ethics, morals, legality...bah.
838183714119110657 2017-03-04 00:25:44 UTC <zoomer46> @TomthunkitsMind This idiot is also a lunatic.
838181094847569921 2017-03-04 00:15:20 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @brhodes Ever play the warm/cold game...Getting warmer!
838180601467441152 2017-03-04 00:13:22 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @VicenteFoxQue What can you expect from a guy who was born behind a dumpster in Queens?
838177221525319680 2017-03-04 23:59:56 UTC <zoomer46> @CantilloLourdes @Loloben63 @monkeyaunt1950 @vidalmayraa @leeace1966 @margaritateresa I KNEW it.
838173860063227904 2017-03-04 23:46:35 UTC <zoomer46> @crooksandliars @AdamsFlaFan I think you would have to start at the top.
838172930001547265 2017-03-04 23:42:53 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 I never know what you are thinking.
838171827402854404 2017-03-04 23:38:30 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @paigeb11 Well. There is hope then.
838171107198976000 2017-03-04 23:35:39 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @DavidCornDC Are you kidding? This impulsive thug just tweets without counsel. Has little knowledge of constitutional law.
838170057595289601 2017-03-04 23:31:28 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @costareports This will be most illuminating when counsel finds out a court ordered the surveillance. A new diversion?
838150409755688961 2017-03-04 22:13:24 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @GeorgeTakei Yes. And then a bird flew by...
838150171699593217 2017-03-04 22:12:27 UTC <zoomer46> @Rosie @margaritateresa @riotwomennn @realDonaldTrump You can just feel the disintegration of this pariah.
838105239286841345 2017-03-04 19:13:54 UTC <zoomer46> @IdealsWin @KimbaGross Good point. He's really good at diverting the media.
838104237066317824 2017-03-04 19:09:55 UTC <zoomer46> @fluffycakewhore @Bvweir @ProCdWthCaution @FluffyCakeWhore @babycats29 @obbibb Six months. He will be dragged out of the WH in a straight jacket.
838097129553920000 2017-03-04 18:41:41 UTC <zoomer46> @theClaudiaInez @ja50nd4vi5 yeah right. In retrospect I should have bet against the house.
838095919954415616 2017-03-04 18:36:53 UTC <zoomer46> @ThRealBallsDeep @Heldinchains I was the victim of a mafia hit in the 30's.
838095103541587968 2017-03-04 18:33:38 UTC <zoomer46> @theClaudiaInez @ja50nd4vi5 Not even close.

838080967340347393 2017-03-04 17:37:28 UTC <zoomer46> @scsporto @davidgross_man Trump has got a screw loose.

838021840341712896 2017-03-04 13:42:31 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @Tedderman1 @ColMorrisDavis i love it when this guy tweets. he helps our cause by exposing his true self.
838021356411359233 2017-03-04 13:40:35 UTC <zoomer46> @jerweber ah yes the inconvenient truth.

838008640200130561 2017-03-04 12:50:03 UTC <zoomer46> @morningmika @JoeNBC @hikergal333 When the media starts talking "presidential" I sort of glaze over.
837841559563427840 2017-03-03 01:46:08 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 @EllenTrailerDog yes and take his cabinet with him.

837816781448306694 2017-03-03 00:07:41 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind He's one of these personalities who thinks he works harder than everybody else. You know the type.

837798113779847170 2017-03-03 22:53:30 UTC <zoomer46> @WhipHoyer @Deecat101 Here's a novel idea. How about we see it before you vote on it.

837796081056559105 2017-03-03 22:45:25 UTC <zoomer46> @HawaiiDelilah @JackDRunyan Christians used to talk about faith hope and charity
837779857325031424 2017-03-03 21:40:57 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid @margaritateresa @mitchellreports This is easy. It would have happened if it was approved. Once again Trump is outwitted.
837778916840509440 2017-03-03 21:37:13 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid @margaritateresa @Roran_Stehl @SenSchumer Knew some guys from Brooklyn. Learned not to get into it with them.
837773789165465600 2017-03-03 21:16:51 UTC <zoomer46> @SenSchumer @margaritateresa Trump is outwitted once again. Almost unfair. Ha.

837748744275824642 2017-03-03 19:37:19 UTC <zoomer46> @ericgarland @ckkoch3 I think they hitched their horses to the wrong wagon.
837744571626979328 2017-03-03 19:20:45 UTC <zoomer46> @greedo737 @heiIDonaIdTrump He can't just not know. He ought to know. Right?
837703865214595072 2017-03-03 16:38:59 UTC <zoomer46> @TheRoot @Kris_Sacrebleu No, Betsy. The point is there was no choice. Giving Betsy the benefit of doubt and assuming she is just dumb.
837701863910871040 2017-03-03 16:31:02 UTC <zoomer46> @KaraCalavera how did you do it? i would like that.
837699939257962496 2017-03-03 16:23:23 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 you know what they say about never.

837366789851971589 2017-03-02 18:19:34 UTC <zoomer46> @SileSkelley @margaritateresa W has had time to think. My guess is he still wants to leave his mark.
837365000507387905 2017-03-02 18:12:28 UTC <zoomer46> @anamariecox @pdmcleod my guess is that they don't want to open that door.
837283031790600192 2017-03-02 12:46:45 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @margaritateresa @ColMorrisDavis An ethics course would be good for anyone. My goodness.

837055977337851905 2017-03-01 21:44:31 UTC <zoomer46> @jimmyhawk9 @jeforse a fine assessment.
837055059015921671 2017-03-01 21:40:52 UTC <zoomer46> @Darlainky @topaz_kell what an outstanding idea.
837054826240430081 2017-03-01 21:39:56 UTC <zoomer46> @MSNBC @vaculb I believe you are correct, sir.
837048177689837569 2017-03-01 21:13:31 UTC <zoomer46> @MrFrankBaraan @margaritateresa @BR_DougFarrar now you're tawkin.
837032799555235844 2017-03-01 20:12:25 UTC <zoomer46> @lauriecrosswell People call me Ed and sometimes, Kevin. I don't care as long as they are friendly. And it's really good if they have food.
836839323471331328 2017-02-28 07:23:37 UTC <zoomer46> @Jhill_2015 how old is he?
836740238458433536 2017-02-28 00:49:53 UTC <zoomer46> @alexbeech @shellyhawthorne great way to describe that look.
836724515027709952 2017-02-28 23:47:24 UTC <zoomer46> @BethW_NoTrump @BVTNH @JamesGleick no class whatsoever. Like some teenage kid mad cause all these dark people are in her daddy's office
836723543853391872 2017-02-28 23:43:33 UTC <zoomer46> The political pendulum swings. It's already swinging our way. Trump helps the cause more than anyone else.
836722869686177792 2017-02-28 23:40:52 UTC <zoomer46> @KaraCalavera @jonfavs @brianstelter he'd have to tell nothing but the truth for decades now  before I would believe him.
836722233494106113 2017-02-28 23:38:20 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu Me too. All you can is show up. The wheels grind slowly.
836712280674947077 2017-02-28 22:58:47 UTC <zoomer46> @KaraCalavera sometimes i think they are
836711892018212864 2017-02-28 22:57:15 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 looks like you scared that tweet away. wish i could have seen it.
836571639265574914 2017-02-28 13:39:56 UTC <zoomer46> @dullandwicked i dreamt my house was falling apart and pipes were leaking. floors rotting. Glad to wake up.

836529369355026433 2017-02-28 10:51:58 UTC <zoomer46> @atruechula They just are. I am sick of trying to figure out why.
836356428814245889 2017-02-27 23:24:46 UTC <zoomer46> @Limeylizzie So do I.
836351029746761728 2017-02-27 23:03:18 UTC <zoomer46> @Vince0350 @PrincessBravato I think people leak sometimes because of a crisis of conscience. They also like to cover their asses
836348646388035585 2017-02-27 22:53:50 UTC <zoomer46> @DMansini Refreshing.
836345478728011776 2017-02-27 22:41:15 UTC <zoomer46> @PalmerReport @Bvweir It's a start and from a former president. I'll take it.

836151180451524608 2017-02-27 09:49:11 UTC <zoomer46> @HawaiiDelilah caveat emptor. sort of.

836019952175955970 2017-02-26 01:07:43 UTC <zoomer46> @KittenMrowl @perfect_messs yes but you can eviscerate them.

835972980194828294 2017-02-26 22:01:04 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 In addition, when our economic policies destroy the Mex economy it will only make the situation worse.
835971006422532098 2017-02-26 21:53:14 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 @imfabulous13 The cover-up is underway. Watergate will look like child's play compared to this.

835917118679941120 2017-02-26 18:19:06 UTC <zoomer46> @ealight461 Yes. All this infighting is just playing into the hands of the opposition.
835911070254497792 2017-02-26 17:55:04 UTC <zoomer46> @notittryagain Yes we will all keep a safe distance and cross the street.
835906749186076674 2017-02-26 17:37:54 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @co_rapunzel4 THAT is really going to be fun.

835214916013420544 2017-02-24 19:48:48 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @morningmoneyben So what. The briefings are mostly rubbish anyway. The press should"trump" them and stop going.

833787990963060737 2017-02-20 21:18:42 UTC <zoomer46> @HawaiiDelilah It is an astounding feat, then, that Hilary won the popular vote. Really quite amazing considering the opposition.

833394885583585280 2017-02-19 19:16:39 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 I am hoping it will all come out sooner rather than later before he really does any real damage.
833349487825416192 2017-02-19 16:16:15 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 Sort of reminds me of Nixon only Nixon looks like a prince compared to this...person.
833294447559397376 2017-02-19 12:37:32 UTC <zoomer46> @Brasilmagic Good. This should happen more often.
833098463076290560 2017-02-18 23:38:46 UTC <zoomer46> @elle_tb15 i got mine but it bounced.
833051437932433409 2017-02-18 20:31:54 UTC <zoomer46> @Loloben63 keep wondering when he breaks out the koolaid.
832957035050311680 2017-02-18 14:16:47 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa Actually. Nothing really surprises me with this POTUS. When given 2 paths he usually takes the wrong one.
832917559196385285 2017-02-18 11:39:55 UTC <zoomer46> @Blondemoment18 @vidalmayraa @margaritateresa @Loloben63 have passed my lips only a few times. isn't enough milk in the world
832821959637495809 2017-02-17 05:20:02 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa run away
832821542258089985 2017-02-17 05:18:23 UTC <zoomer46> @Blondemoment18 @vidalmayraa @Loloben63 @margaritateresa what if you don't like scones?
832355103021621249 2017-02-16 22:24:55 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @danpfeiffer so who gets their information from cable news? r.e.a.d.
832354554364755973 2017-02-16 22:22:44 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JYSexton That's a start!
832342074729037824 2017-02-16 21:33:09 UTC <zoomer46> @Kris_Sacrebleu Respectful questions like this are what we need. Kudos @PeterAlexander
832339930751827969 2017-02-16 21:24:38 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa Thorazine. He's already got the shuffle down.
832339563226001408 2017-02-16 21:23:10 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa exactly
832338531284578304 2017-02-16 21:19:04 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa one of these times he's going to lay on the floor and start pounding his fists.
832338136390856704 2017-02-16 21:17:30 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa i'd hide him in the closet if i was his keeper. who let this guy out anyway.
832336245158268930 2017-02-16 21:09:59 UTC <zoomer46> @HoosierMum @danpfeiffer oh lord.
832332604150013952 2017-02-16 20:55:31 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa maybe i'll read about it. i can't take it.
832330411409887240 2017-02-16 20:46:48 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Kris_Sacrebleu so. my kayak ride didn't change anything.
832197998046228482 2017-02-16 12:00:38 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ChrisJZullo I am going kayaking today. Need a break from this craziness.
831986758468399106 2017-02-15 22:01:15 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 I like the idea of distracting him with a laser pointer. Like right out the door of the WH.
831986328279605255 2017-02-15 21:59:32 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @HFAreddit Eastern Emperor Zeno. This is one of the oldest tricks in the book.
831985234820345858 2017-02-15 21:55:12 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 I don't even know if he regrets his vote. Afraid to ask.
831984744263012353 2017-02-15 21:53:15 UTC <zoomer46> @yenniwhite I can remember saying (yelling). Don't touch anything!
831984238568157184 2017-02-15 21:51:14 UTC <zoomer46> @RhapsodysBIues @SortaBad I think you are on to something. Lead him right out of the WH.
831971727953580032 2017-02-15 21:01:31 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 I do. We don't talk about it.
831970829747515392 2017-02-15 20:57:57 UTC <zoomer46> @gaaaaayyy @_zolarmoon I guess this is easier than the environmental answers? Sounds crazy to me.
831968315912359936 2017-02-15 20:47:58 UTC <zoomer46> @HawaiiDelilah Yes. A free press and honest elections are the keystones holding on to a tenuous democracy.
831967655959601152 2017-02-15 20:45:21 UTC <zoomer46> @attnii @Deecat101 @attnIi I am convinced when the truth comes out Watergate will look like child's play.
831966382841421825 2017-02-15 20:40:17 UTC <zoomer46> @sixfootcandy @PinkCamoTO 2 or 3 cords
831965247112101889 2017-02-15 20:35:46 UTC <zoomer46> @Mistress_Jan Don't worry. The plan is to deport all the mentally ill.
831964885294645248 2017-02-15 20:34:20 UTC <zoomer46> @dpantherapardus @DavidCornDC There will be no consistency of policy from this administration which is a leaderless mob.
831961583223988224 2017-02-15 20:21:13 UTC <zoomer46> @lulu_lemew Buzzing jets, cruise missile, spy ship, troop movement on Ukraine border. Coincidence? I think not.
831957264730828801 2017-02-15 20:04:03 UTC <zoomer46> @USDOL @lauriecrosswell @SenWarren Is he tired or is he distancing himself from this administration?
831956550583451648 2017-02-15 20:01:13 UTC <zoomer46> @leeshutterbug @soledadobrien I think we may see Republicans on the Hill distancing themselves from this administration.
831954010869530636 2017-02-15 19:51:07 UTC <zoomer46> @jeforse @alfonslopeztena Our faith in our election process needs a thorough bipartisan investigation.
831952967288905728 2017-02-15 19:46:58 UTC <zoomer46> @neilpX @Bosphiz The election tampering by a foreign power makes Watergate look like child's play. Howard Baker. Where are you now?
831946483565985792 2017-02-15 19:21:13 UTC <zoomer46> @PalmerReport @badgirl_loony Y=The Cover-up is now in full swing.
831946155458232332 2017-02-15 19:19:54 UTC <zoomer46> @theClaudiaInez they are obviously in a bunch.

831867023743385601 2017-02-15 14:05:28 UTC <zoomer46> @mmcauliff @michele5411 @jbendery no wait. they are going to deport all the mentally ill. not to worry.
831810630873120768 2017-02-15 10:21:23 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @KaivanShroff There is so much wrong with this administration that it's hard to keep track of it all.
831809978331693056 2017-02-15 10:18:47 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @badwebsites At first I thought it was just strange now I think it was conspiracy.
831809118092529664 2017-02-15 10:15:22 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @steenfox Independent investigation. We owe it to democracy.
831645855547539456 2017-02-14 23:26:37 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ananavarro Pence is scary beacuse he comes across as sane. Make no mistake.
831645352960880640 2017-02-14 23:24:38 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ananavarro This is true. My vote is for Bannon and Miller to go. I can dream. Can't I?

831415257394470912 2017-02-14 08:10:18 UTC <zoomer46> @HawaiiDelilah This admin throws up one smokescreen after another. The election cover-up is the real story here.
831410233696206849 2017-02-13 07:50:21 UTC <zoomer46> @HawaiiDelilah Yes. We may never have an honest election again if we don't seriously investigate Russia's impact on the election.

830995873215737859 2017-02-12 04:23:49 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @danpfeiffer A good tree bears good fruit, The shake up needs to include POTUS.
830994652165705729 2017-02-12 04:18:58 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ericgarland POTUS is a loose canon with no conception of protocol. This man is dangerous in many ways.
830967015686930432 2017-02-12 02:29:09 UTC <zoomer46> @chucktodd @ZanyCountryGeek yes. there's the White House and then there's other houses

829644477983764481 2017-02-09 10:53:52 UTC <zoomer46> @ABC my guess is her shoddy knock off merchandise wasn't selling. just a thought.

829501533364551680 2017-02-08 01:25:51 UTC <zoomer46> @ThePlumLineGS @TPM maybe the real reason is that the merchandise was not selling

829328190510333952 2017-02-08 13:57:03 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @TVietor08 Of course they did. It's a chance you take in a mission like this. Good opportunity to assess operation.
829278323893268480 2017-02-08 10:38:54 UTC <zoomer46> @KaivanShroff That is correct. Each lie refuted. One at at time. Even when there seem to be too many to monitor.

822955403873058816 2017-01-21 23:53:52 UTC <zoomer46> @drinkingbeerman i guess you were unhappy with it?
822945763370082305 2017-01-21 23:15:34 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 I don't think the first amendment is hugely important to these grifters.
822944911154614272 2017-01-21 23:12:11 UTC <zoomer46> @atparkslope i can just see him throwing his toys all over the oval office and his au pair running around picking things up looking for his pacifier.
822944255715004416 2017-01-21 23:09:34 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 At the first press conference the message was clear that the only reliable news is what the administration puts forth. A grave precedent.
822862170249719809 2017-01-21 17:43:24 UTC <zoomer46> @njm4250 @everywhereist The GOP is just damned glad to send that pesky black couple packing and fill the white house with entitled white people.

822792476759130112 2017-01-21 13:06:27 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @RepAdamSchiff Trump painted a grim picture of USA. The whole day was very gray.
822792216741609472 2017-01-21 13:05:25 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @margaritateresa @SenWarren so much for the little people
822791073928015873 2017-01-21 13:00:53 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @BillMoyersHQ The scary part of this is that there probably will be many more lies to come. Yesterday's lies about crime, economy, military...a start.

822538767802241025 2017-01-20 20:18:18 UTC <zoomer46> Hilary is not in the white house because of sexism. A man under the same circumstances would be sleeping in the White House tonight,
822509068787077120 2017-01-20 18:20:18 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 oh sure. build roads bridges, tunnels railways explore the mysteries of space annnd cut taxes.

820639530126557185 2017-01-15 14:31:25 UTC <zoomer46> Trump is a thin skinned wimp.

820592343627792386 2017-01-15 11:23:55 UTC <zoomer46> @OutOnTheMoors @girl_a_whirl I hate when the drop down filter key question pops up.
820566253228191744 2017-01-15 09:40:14 UTC <zoomer46> @leenaban Which one. There are so many from which to choose.
820565661231579136 2017-01-15 09:37:53 UTC <zoomer46> For the first time in years I am running out of firewood. This, I think, is the tip of the iceberg.
820564571022884864 2017-01-15 09:33:33 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa Sitting up front back then was a dangerous, courageous thing to do. It was an amazing first step toward equality. Kudos to Rosa Parks.

820385917521248256 2017-01-14 21:43:39 UTC <zoomer46> playing with a bandaid on my finger...i blame it on the futon but it really just me.
820377587444830210 2017-01-14 21:10:33 UTC <zoomer46> @Ummm_Nope_ yes it is.

820313115824885760 2017-01-14 16:54:22 UTC <zoomer46> something is wrong. there are no parts left over.
820312825365200896 2017-01-14 16:53:12 UTC <zoomer46> just put a futon together. whoa.
820291955003256832 2017-01-14 15:30:17 UTC <zoomer46> @Bob_Janke you can do this.
820210713935364097 2017-01-14 10:07:27 UTC <zoomer46> @frankdugan @paulkrugman so we've got that going for us.

820055695143948288 2017-01-13 23:51:28 UTC <zoomer46> Winning at the expense of the common good is not all that productive.
820049352282542080 2017-01-13 23:26:16 UTC <zoomer46> @SenFranken @_MirandaRites_ This is a classic example of politicians more concerned with winning at the expense of common sense.
820047461356081153 2017-01-13 23:18:45 UTC <zoomer46> @SenFranken @_MirandaRites_ Most of them were too busy trying to grasp the concept that obamacare was the ACA.
820046191643738113 2017-01-13 23:13:42 UTC <zoomer46> @_MirandaRites_ @SenFranken a very simple straightforward plan.

820038707470364672 2017-01-13 22:43:58 UTC <zoomer46> @mjclark21 @paulkrugman My guess is that many will not blame him although I am hoping otherwise.
820038182813179905 2017-01-13 22:41:53 UTC <zoomer46> @mjclark21 @hotelkeys um. so if you are poor, you are automatically irresponsible? this is a misguided thought process.

819279458033090561 2017-01-11 20:26:58 UTC <zoomer46> @dullandwicked you are not alone
819229662467522564 2017-01-11 17:09:06 UTC <zoomer46> @StevePh49215783 @eVilleMike This is a clear path to victory.
819166514041487360 2017-01-11 12:58:10 UTC <zoomer46> @KaraCalavera James Comey is shameless and in total denial of the damage he has done to the democratic process.
819166154849656832 2017-01-11 12:56:45 UTC <zoomer46> @JoeNBC @VABVOX Can you say double standard?
819128452225896449 2017-01-11 10:26:56 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @KAmorphous Andrea is a slave to the earpiece. Management calls the shots. Edward R Morrow she is not. or Walter Cronkite for that matter.
819113880014229504 2017-01-11 09:29:02 UTC <zoomer46> @achieveofkid @Harryofnote I wonder what products she uses to make her hair bounce like that.
819113477608382465 2017-01-11 09:27:26 UTC <zoomer46> Something like this could bring down the PEOTUS.https://twitter.com/GuardianUS/status/818979680984383488
818953460028739584 2017-01-10 22:51:34 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ezlusztig There really was something awry with James Comey. Kudos to Angus King for pointing out the hypocrisy...
818948775351910400 2017-01-10 22:32:58 UTC <zoomer46> @thenation @nuzzel @StevePh49215783 @g_mccray What you want in this office is a proponent of a fair, objective interpretation of the law with no personal agenda. Sessions is not the man.
818908032428023808 2017-01-10 19:51:04 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @DavidYankovich The tweets will be really ludicrous if it ever even got under twenty. If it wasn't so scary it would be funny...dark humor, i guess.
818898689347436545 2017-01-10 19:13:56 UTC <zoomer46> @marcorubio @margaritateresa Go on.
818898514126237697 2017-01-10 19:13:14 UTC <zoomer46> @Donna_DHKBB Yes. That too.
818886562406612992 2017-01-10 18:25:45 UTC <zoomer46> @landolfi @Redpainter1 I agree. This is going to go down in history as a defining moment. Will our fight be effective?
818883948772294656 2017-01-10 18:15:22 UTC <zoomer46> @brontyman @davidmackau So. Another fine example of smug Republican humor. Who looks entitled now?
818878386290520068 2017-01-10 17:53:15 UTC <zoomer46> @No_Idteaots @Jillrocksyou1 @TammaraMaiden1 @co_rapunzel4 This is true. What a horrendous development.
818877015721910273 2017-01-10 17:47:49 UTC <zoomer46> @No_Idteaots @Jillrocksyou1 @TammaraMaiden1 @co_rapunzel4 They really did. How could this guy have scammed so many people?
818784742556438528 2017-01-10 11:41:09 UTC <zoomer46> @citizengatsby @EricBoehlert Tucker is such a what...nonentity.
818780805438832641 2017-01-10 11:25:30 UTC <zoomer46> @CNN @Barkforlove1 wrong.
818748558027407361 2017-01-10 09:17:22 UTC <zoomer46> @ShomahKhoobi duh.
818746197208866816 2017-01-10 09:07:59 UTC <zoomer46> @blndvmpyr If we continue to point out Trump's lies, more people will stop listening to him. One can only hope.
818743480319143936 2017-01-10 08:57:11 UTC <zoomer46> @MonarchPD @puppymnkey Mel who?
818743378548551680 2017-01-10 08:56:47 UTC <zoomer46> @OutOnTheMoors @lasergirl70 ok.
818741571311063040 2017-01-10 08:49:36 UTC <zoomer46> @MorningJoe @TomthunkitsMind one answer is to stop watching.
818723348591104000 2017-01-09 07:37:12 UTC <zoomer46> i've never done it if that is any indication. ha
818716335870013440 2017-01-09 07:09:20 UTC <zoomer46> Or maybe Trump should apologize for...boy where do I start?
818683901556166656 2017-01-09 05:00:27 UTC <zoomer46> Sean Hannity's.
818682134680498177 2017-01-09 04:53:25 UTC <zoomer46> @2020fight maybe a bad memory too
818681078064021504 2017-01-09 04:49:14 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa they could be that stupid.
818680616497643520 2017-01-09 04:47:23 UTC <zoomer46> @DailyNewsBin @Donna_DHKBB it seems like it happens whenever he tweets
818680181971894274 2017-01-09 04:45:40 UTC <zoomer46> @Siouxie1999 @seanhannity in your dreams.
818586508449824768 2017-01-09 22:33:26 UTC <zoomer46> @landolfi @TomthunkitsMind Well. He was right on that score.
818586025433776128 2017-01-09 22:31:31 UTC <zoomer46> @people @lulu_lemew @kylegriffin1 the emperor has no clothes.
818585167061102592 2017-01-09 22:28:07 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 and you too.
818584460346036224 2017-01-09 22:25:18 UTC <zoomer46> @tgreene319 This is the stuff that made white America great. These guys wouldn't know wrong if they fell over it.
818583976877006848 2017-01-09 22:23:23 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @StephenKing Trump is a classic case of arrested development. My guess is he is stuck at around 14.
818540123088424963 2017-01-09 19:29:07 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JoyAnnReid whoa.
818532452394303488 2017-01-09 18:58:38 UTC <zoomer46> @KatePeople It enrages them because deep down they know she speaks the truth. And we can't have that. Can we?
818531021289299970 2017-01-09 18:52:57 UTC <zoomer46> @2020fight This is great. Where was I when this occurred? Certainly not befitting behavior for a PEOTUS or candidate.
818530317904596997 2017-01-09 18:50:10 UTC <zoomer46> @vidalmayraa @margaritateresa @Loloben63 Lord. I hope so.
818528125726445568 2017-01-09 18:41:27 UTC <zoomer46> @tgreene319 All of a sudden Conway wants to take the high road. This tickles me.
818527445909323777 2017-01-09 18:38:45 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa When this guy reacts it can only mean he has been reached negatively. Kudos Meryl Streep. You got a response.
818526796090064898 2017-01-09 18:36:10 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa This unfortunate ridicule of a handicapped person is captured in a video. Denial of this is nothing short of ludicrous.
818253510676508672 2017-01-08 00:30:14 UTC <zoomer46> @NooneOfan me neither.
818252249377947648 2017-01-08 00:25:13 UTC <zoomer46> @dumbbeezie @chrisdowning now i can't either. thanks.
818249508907876352 2017-01-08 00:14:19 UTC <zoomer46> @kathybotteas this guy is a keeper.
818248969667117058 2017-01-08 00:12:11 UTC <zoomer46> @kathybotteas no.no. it's in the refrigerator.
818247193727565825 2017-01-08 00:05:07 UTC <zoomer46> @tgreene319 See and you thought you would never get on board.
818246989397848065 2017-01-08 00:04:19 UTC <zoomer46> @ealight461 This is too deep for them.
818246840483282944 2017-01-08 00:03:43 UTC <zoomer46> @AtticusFinch79 @krisv_723 i feel your pain. that happened to me with barry manilow once. oh mandy...
818241660886937600 2017-01-08 23:43:08 UTC <zoomer46> @UnFitz my fingers are to big to make this work. good idea though.
818240994839789570 2017-01-08 23:40:30 UTC <zoomer46> @EnarDavis1 @laurenduca We would be... what...better off.
818240389996052480 2017-01-08 23:38:05 UTC <zoomer46> @KaraCalavera Lindsey Graham is full of surprises. I have to admire this.
818238688618512385 2017-01-08 23:31:20 UTC <zoomer46> ha. idiot.https://twitter.com/TrashyChic/status/816339402259623936
818237416989454336 2017-01-08 23:26:16 UTC <zoomer46> @politicususa @margaritateresa @RealMuckmaker Kudos to Chuck Todd and Meet the Press for not allowing BS to air. Let's see more of this.
818207054452113411 2017-01-08 21:25:37 UTC <zoomer46> @DavidYankovich i do too.
817838427722960898 2017-01-07 21:00:50 UTC <zoomer46> @2020fight it's a broken pair of 3d glasses.
817837503537352707 2017-01-07 20:57:10 UTC <zoomer46> @jerweber He is missing the point. This was an attack on our democratic election process. He has a myopic view of the situation.
817831796654145538 2017-01-07 20:34:29 UTC <zoomer46> @BillyBaldwin sort of, key.
817813222862573568 2017-01-07 19:20:41 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @komaramusic Yes . That's a much more comfortable equation for him.
817813000413466626 2017-01-07 19:19:48 UTC <zoomer46> @realangsiegel @keithboykin This shows an amazing ability to rationalize anything.
817784950334308353 2017-01-07 17:28:20 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @susanj357 i see paris. i see france. i see donald's underpants. something dt can understand. very mature.
817747303238893568 2017-01-07 14:58:44 UTC <zoomer46> @washingtonpost @margaritateresa @kylegriffin1 Success really is a state of mind then. Easy for a delusional person to see it that way.
817729258281979905 2017-01-07 13:47:02 UTC <zoomer46> @OutOnTheMoors @t_annn i have no problem with this.
817728447250362368 2017-01-07 13:43:49 UTC <zoomer46> @nolanperson @adbridgeforth overcompensating much?
817725474315051008 2017-01-07 13:32:00 UTC <zoomer46> @OutOnTheMoors @iwearaonesie but why did you do it?
817720146630479872 2017-01-07 13:10:50 UTC <zoomer46> @dullandwicked just when i thought it was safe, the demon comes back to say hello.
817718569458892800 2017-01-07 13:04:34 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 I know some very nice people who have really troubled children.
817718231175667712 2017-01-07 13:03:13 UTC <zoomer46> @JJohnsonLaw I am fairly certain the pendulum will swing back to the left if we ever have an honest election again.
817717906486214656 2017-01-07 13:01:56 UTC <zoomer46> @UnFitz @MakesYouGiggle I have a fire going in the wood stove. That helps.
817717647169224704 2017-01-07 13:00:54 UTC <zoomer46> @iamsweetpea69 It's difficult to not just lash out at this person. I don't get it at all.
817687185210097665 2017-01-07 10:59:51 UTC <zoomer46> @UnFitz @jackiembouvier it's ok. i have club soda.
817671437318291457 2017-01-07 09:57:16 UTC <zoomer46> @SpeakerRyan @GOP @sandralhanlon Hey Paul, you will say anything. Won't you?
817662604571213825 2017-01-07 09:22:11 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JJohnsonLaw It is this kind of action that is very encouraging. more of this on the state level would be productive.
817661532771414016 2017-01-07 09:17:55 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @TimODee16 i feel your pain.

817660933883498496 2017-01-07 09:15:32 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa @Tedderman1 I actually think this kind of humor is very effective.

817495508042268673 2017-01-06 22:18:12 UTC <zoomer46> @granitevoter @margaritateresa incomprehensible.
817493157768261633 2017-01-06 22:08:51 UTC <zoomer46> @bipartisan @RealMuckmaker Kudos to the Terminator. The high road. I love it.

817367129993383936 2017-01-06 13:48:04 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa @BenBerkon Both.
817366259432091650 2017-01-06 13:44:36 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa impossible for this moron to get past his ego.
817364481944748033 2017-01-06 13:37:33 UTC <zoomer46> @deanofcomedy It seems like this guy's motivation is pretty much always ego driven. Strange.
817315552515461120 2017-01-06 10:23:07 UTC <zoomer46> @Michell82968785 @Cathyquintilian special ops? ha.
817298319454175232 2017-01-06 09:14:38 UTC <zoomer46> @RaisingOneBrow I have been done with this organization as a news source for quite a while and will continue.
817296822666493953 2017-01-06 09:08:41 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX We can do this.
817138785012039680 2017-01-05 22:40:42 UTC <zoomer46> @IMPL0RABLE I am telling you. This guy is not as dumb as he looks.
817138493952524289 2017-01-05 22:39:33 UTC <zoomer46> @JumpTheRework @CBooker2020 Sure. Another great day on the Hill and they will all sleep like babies tonight.

817123443288240128 2017-01-05 21:39:44 UTC <zoomer46> @J_Fonte28 This kind of stupidly is easy to combat and very predictable. This is not a deep person.
817121180301856768 2017-01-05 21:30:45 UTC <zoomer46> @fdwilkinson @margaritateresa @NormOrnstein It is easy to underestimate Trump. Don't do it. the man is dangerous.
816895673123696641 2017-01-04 06:34:40 UTC <zoomer46> @co_rapunzel4 @Brasilmagic Ooh. Maybe we can employ the scientific parting of the red sea technique to combat coastal flooding.

816785445229039617 2017-01-04 23:16:39 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @bobcesca_go No wait. Trump didn't do his homework? This is so uncharacteristic.
816784551674572801 2017-01-04 23:13:06 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @BitchestheCat At least it was a live cat.

816780903213137930 2017-01-04 22:58:37 UTC <zoomer46> @mike_pence @co_rapunzel4 @No_Idteaots definitely a head scratcher.
816776356528869376 2017-01-04 22:40:33 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Stonekettle this must have been part of his stand-up routine.

814748749079736320 2016-12-30 08:23:33 UTC <zoomer46> @DavidCornDC Why would Trump not want to investigate at all?  He's either part of it or too enamored with the results to do anything.

814498450607865856 2016-12-29 15:48:57 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa This is actually so wrong it is funny.
814498182495404032 2016-12-29 15:47:54 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @kylegriffin1 Do they ever think that if they can do it to the Dems one day the Dems will do it to them?
814497845663371265 2016-12-29 15:46:33 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Donna_DHKBB Trump doesn't seem to know right from wrong but it is no excuse.

814259495568375813 2016-12-28 23:59:26 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @DavidYankovich thank you so much, kevin. your welcome. not at all.

814225992785031170 2016-12-28 21:46:18 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Art_Guy1 Hear. Hear. Money talks and BS walks.
814225120826945537 2016-12-28 21:42:51 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @nick2crosby hey donny, put that in your pipe and smokes it.
814224824184623104 2016-12-28 21:41:40 UTC <zoomer46> @WilliamsSonoma @margaritateresa @slpng_giants and they have nice sheets.
814224609503543296 2016-12-28 21:40:49 UTC <zoomer46> @LibyanBentBladi seems late in the game.
814222058427154432 2016-12-28 21:30:40 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @VA4Hillary1 You nailed this creep's personality.
814139957879128064 2016-12-28 16:04:26 UTC <zoomer46> @Proud2Progress @margaritateresa important to be precise when telling a fib.

814108769714077696 2016-12-28 14:00:30 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @KaraCalavera wait a minute. he has the gall to take credit for this. has he no knowledge of economic cycles?
813891842601263104 2016-12-27 23:38:31 UTC <zoomer46> @LibyaLiberty @crampell Why that means they are dumber than I thought. That's amazing.
813792752525787136 2016-12-27 17:04:46 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien This man is more concerned about image than anything else. I think he likes to appear like a philanthropist.
813792044183416833 2016-12-27 17:01:57 UTC <zoomer46> @PaladinCornelia @AlanaSemuels I can see this as I vote democratic almost exclusively.
813789655707635716 2016-12-27 16:52:28 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JohnJHarwood I sure hope that trend continues.
813714536171798528 2016-12-27 11:53:58 UTC <zoomer46> @LibyanBentBladi Sure. They were ashamed.
813533592496275457 2016-12-26 23:54:57 UTC <zoomer46> @StopTrump2020 @hcfishing4 @Aszneth you should move. 33 and rain here. nice.
813533159455420416 2016-12-26 23:53:14 UTC <zoomer46> @elizabeth28536 i never had a blow up doll. so to speak. but the newtster seems to to be up on the topic.
813517089654841344 2016-12-26 22:49:23 UTC <zoomer46> @BalmyBalmer @DickPolman1 quite a contrast.
813406308384854016 2016-12-26 15:29:10 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @NoNo2GOP count me in.
813101196890243072 2016-12-25 19:16:46 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @margaritateresa @idnov This sounds familiar.
813087675750223873 2016-12-25 18:23:02 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @matthewjdowd Why would someone quote this murderer? It is so crazy it almost makes sense.
813087327270604800 2016-12-25 18:21:39 UTC <zoomer46> @jonfavs it would be great if they fired up all 65 million to become a unified political force.
813086464280068096 2016-12-25 18:18:14 UTC <zoomer46> @PaladinCornelia These misguided, reprehensible people could ruin a magnificent country.
813082250023682048 2016-12-25 18:01:29 UTC <zoomer46> @USARedOrchestra @margaritateresa The first amendment is such a nuisance.
813051667377688576 2016-12-25 15:59:57 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @USARedOrchestra Doesn't the first amendment come into play here somewhere?
813050503043186689 2016-12-25 15:55:20 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @laurenduca unless you come back for innerfundibulum. that works.
812961964389441536 2016-12-25 10:03:31 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa Merry Christmas.
812839204891803649 2016-12-24 01:55:42 UTC <zoomer46> @PaladinCornelia @CharlesMBlow good day to organize my sock drawer.
812807162686795776 2016-12-24 23:48:23 UTC <zoomer46> @editoremilye Ooh nice. Had a similar experience today. I was one of two customers in a jewelry store. Priceless.
812803554977206272 2016-12-24 23:34:03 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien Merry Christmas!

812779922246733824 2016-12-24 22:00:08 UTC <zoomer46> @laurenduca @realangsiegel @AlanaMassey Oh honey? I was raised in the 50's and even i wouldn't ever say that. Very strange.

812601388991741952 2016-12-24 10:10:43 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @JenKirkman holy smokes. i wonder what was in the coffee.
812473794094911488 2016-12-23 01:43:42 UTC <zoomer46> @JJohnsonLaw @Aszneth @HuffPostPol yes. Why drag the five year olds into this?
812473499595968512 2016-12-23 01:42:31 UTC <zoomer46> @KellyannePolls @JoyAnnReid we are expected to believe this?
812430746405179393 2016-12-23 22:52:38 UTC <zoomer46> @PaladinCornelia Trump doesn't know who she is.
812411212252200960 2016-12-23 21:35:01 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @MaraWilson That's convenient. Can you say double standard?

812406211383595008 2016-12-23 21:15:09 UTC <zoomer46> @LibyaLiberty this is funny in a grim way.
812393062987104256 2016-12-23 20:22:54 UTC <zoomer46> @SarahKSilverm I am sure they don't. Their beliefs make them Fascists and the label means nothing to them. Just a thought.
812383542936215552 2016-12-23 19:45:04 UTC <zoomer46> @PaladinCornelia Where does one begin deciphering the James Joycean ramble of a PE who does not comprehend the power of his words?
812375400512942081 2016-12-23 19:12:43 UTC <zoomer46> @OhNoSheTwitnt @Aszneth i really think a kick line of men in drag would be an outstanding moment. Please someone make it so.
812373628872523776 2016-12-23 19:05:40 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @20committee This off the cuff tweeting about a nuclear arms race is the result of an adolescent PE.
812373164403683328 2016-12-23 19:03:50 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @RobertaSaidThat Trump is an approval junkie and Putin has his number. If it wasn't so dangerous it would be very funny.
812125338553765891 2016-12-22 02:39:03 UTC <zoomer46> @longwall26 @Aszneth what a surprise
811742902070153220 2016-12-21 01:19:23 UTC <zoomer46> @PaladinCornelia this guy is out of his gourd.
811347545586864128 2016-12-20 23:08:23 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ananavarro bad taste. no taste. no class. no sense of propriety.
810595828503117824 2016-12-18 21:21:20 UTC <zoomer46> @KeithOlbermann There is something seriously wrong with these cretins.
810578364297805825 2016-12-18 20:11:56 UTC <zoomer46> @shondi99 @Aszneth I think this man should go back under the rock from whence he came.
810575700260438016 2016-12-18 20:01:21 UTC <zoomer46> @elizabeth28536 2 steps forward, one step back. Trump sank the ship of Democratic Party's dissent.
810574617182081024 2016-12-18 19:57:03 UTC <zoomer46> @realangsiegel @davidfrum Time to either eliminate or adjust the electoral college. No one really benefits from this.
810572091498041344 2016-12-18 19:47:00 UTC <zoomer46> @aravosis Growing up in the 50's with the cold war had an up side. We KNEW the Soviets were our enemies.
810568542080921601 2016-12-18 19:32:54 UTC <zoomer46> @PaladinCornelia Maybe those hoops were designed as a deterrent. I have wondered about those dresses. More than once.
810287557401518080 2016-12-17 00:56:22 UTC <zoomer46> @RT_America @RT_com @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa @JoelNihlean that's the first sign of a human side.
809723651226529792 2016-12-16 11:35:37 UTC <zoomer46> @LibyanBentBladi @SamGrittner i know. she could have rowed over there and put a stop to it.
809539030413090816 2016-12-15 23:22:00 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @pittgriffin so this is an example bad taste or no taste. i like sitting by my wood stove.

809507077462851584 2016-12-15 21:15:01 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa The inability to feel empathy or sympathy for the victims of political strife is despicable.
809506427085684737 2016-12-15 21:12:26 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa that is just wrong

809107408035414018 2016-12-14 18:46:53 UTC <zoomer46> @PaladinCornelia it was a grim day watching the death toll rise. i will never forget it.
808713102766305280 2016-12-13 16:40:03 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien This is funny.

808620741369495552 2016-12-13 10:33:02 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @CharlesMBlow I've been painting bedrooms and on good days, cutting firewood.
808436339356090369 2016-12-12 22:20:17 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa who are these six. i want their names. ha.
808096932191158272 2016-12-11 23:51:37 UTC <zoomer46> @SenJohnMcCain doing the right thing. kudos!

806665819375681540 2016-12-07 01:04:53 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa great stuff. thank you.
806568236393365510 2016-12-07 18:37:07 UTC <zoomer46> @WFSBnews Here we go. Right. It was all a hoax to enable gun control legislation to pass. Have we taken leave of our senses?
806567028341571586 2016-12-07 18:32:19 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa How many generals does it take to change a light bulb?

805880431736393728 2016-12-05 21:04:02 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @TheRickWilson Sounds like a position in Gotham City. He looks like someone from Batman. Can't put my finger on it.
805120218297200640 2016-12-03 18:43:13 UTC <zoomer46> good advicehttps://twitter.com/LibyaLiberty/status/805114216504053764

804880983157862401 2016-12-02 02:52:35 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @AlecMacGillis was there ever any doubt?
804851289746264065 2016-12-02 00:54:35 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Stonekettle if this guy is a navy "seel", i am a spelling bee champion
804849888777371648 2016-12-02 00:49:01 UTC <zoomer46> @DebraMessing and he isn't even in office yet. guess they didn't fact check the US/ROC relationship
804795356768768000 2016-12-02 21:12:20 UTC <zoomer46> @greg_doucette @DebraMessing @getnickwright holy smokes.
804794956661592064 2016-12-02 21:10:44 UTC <zoomer46> @jonlovett @margaritateresa @RVAwonk Apparently facts are very unfashionable.
804791826880360449 2016-12-02 20:58:18 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien @AriMelber I would say the video was very convincing. He was running away for starters.
804760327233662976 2016-12-02 18:53:08 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien You are a better man (woman) than I, Gunda Din.
804462667507318784 2016-12-01 23:10:20 UTC <zoomer46> @blackvoices @margaritateresa @missLtoe i am curious. is this type of threat something that the pc haters wanted to unleash?
804460494333550593 2016-12-01 23:01:42 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX faggy? what is this? 1958?
804448414641504256 2016-12-01 22:13:42 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien i remember the news coverage when he was in Oriente (sp?) Province. He was the darling of the Batista ensuing coup.
803675007054446593 2016-11-29 19:00:27 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @cenkuygur i think they think if they say it enough, people will begin to believe it was a landslide.
803673099581423616 2016-11-29 18:52:53 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @SethMacFarlane now we are at the root, so to speak, of the problem
803651197471105024 2016-11-29 17:25:51 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien constitution. bah.
803371613945298944 2016-11-28 22:54:53 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @davidaxelrod and yesterday i ran a 4 minute mile but the really amazing thing was i was tweeting the whole time. no lie.
803350819332640768 2016-11-28 21:32:15 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien The last few days of tweets have been enlightening. You are patient person.
803343995627782145 2016-11-28 21:05:08 UTC <zoomer46> @MarkHarrisNYC @margaritateresa ah. The "nd" factor.

803015854971555841 2016-11-27 23:21:13 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX this is not a difficult concept.
803013638315450368 2016-11-27 23:12:25 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @margaritateresa @TimODee16 ouch.
803000996943122433 2016-11-27 22:22:11 UTC <zoomer46> @CBS @VABVOX oh lord
802990135650516992 2016-11-27 21:39:01 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien This guy will tweet anything.
802891927091822592 2016-11-27 15:08:47 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @tribelaw because being president elect is more important than taking a stance against bigotry.
802833929312972801 2016-11-27 11:18:19 UTC <zoomer46> @Amy_Siskind One would think Russia's influence in the election would be important news as well.
802680503929143297 2016-11-26 01:08:39 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien Cruz probably never heard of the corporal works of mercy either.
802600064929722369 2016-11-26 19:49:01 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien good decision.
802337903712075776 2016-11-25 02:27:17 UTC <zoomer46> @KatyTurNBC @BruhSmellmyfeet how eloquent.
802333698364506117 2016-11-25 02:10:34 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien praying won't help if you can't stand up for yourself.
802143439664062464 2016-11-25 13:34:33 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien rough patch at 14. got word back to me that i would be a great father one day. needed to hear this. kind soul.
801491140977590272 2016-11-23 18:22:33 UTC <zoomer46> @LibyanBentBladi this is reprehensible.

801008547421179904 2016-11-22 10:24:54 UTC <zoomer46> @robreiner this is not exactly sneaking up on us.
800825422896361473 2016-11-21 22:17:14 UTC <zoomer46> @BrianPaulStuart @margaritateresa i get to go south in Feb and March. there isn't enough prozac in the world to keep me here then
800812594516946944 2016-11-21 21:26:15 UTC <zoomer46> @BrianPaulStuart @margaritateresa i've got a nice fire going in the family room. very toasty.
800694304318619648 2016-11-21 13:36:12 UTC <zoomer46> i don't follow djt. it seems to me that if you want to negate some of the free coverage he is getting, you should unfollow him.
800680173213392896 2016-11-21 12:40:03 UTC <zoomer46> @BrianPaulStuart @margaritateresa beautiful covering of snow this morning! talk to me in January though.
800651292930490369 2016-11-21 10:45:18 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @BrianPaulStuart this picture reminds me of a carly simon song about a guy walking onto a yacht.
800649200732172288 2016-11-21 10:36:59 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien i guess i better not be a truck driver when i grow up.
800472564132937730 2016-11-20 22:55:06 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX he is definitely scary. it's like he has a pence mask on.
800366293849227266 2016-11-20 15:52:49 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX a moment of clarity.
800365172195987457 2016-11-20 15:48:21 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX get an education, learn how to spell and maybe, just maybe you would have work.
800321032003391488 2016-11-20 12:52:57 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ThePlumLineGS i think this crew is amoral.
800296678410649600 2016-11-20 11:16:11 UTC <zoomer46> @MMASOCCERFAN can you say double standard?
800287304912871424 2016-11-20 10:38:56 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @emigre80 i guess trump never thought of that.
800024911632863232 2016-11-19 17:16:17 UTC <zoomer46> @editoremilye i like it.
799923001756155904 2016-11-19 10:31:20 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @robreiner these developments make me very concerned about the direction this country is taking.
799922229572038656 2016-11-19 10:28:16 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @mattyglesias he'll fit right in now.
799922102208000000 2016-11-19 10:27:45 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @armandodkos they let it all out of the bag.
799921749936762881 2016-11-19 10:26:21 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @robreiner paying out 25m is sort of like an admission of guilt. isn't it?
799725966398345216 2016-11-18 21:28:23 UTC <zoomer46> @robreiner oh sure. he's white, rich, shallow and doesn't read. what could go wrong?
799723049822130176 2016-11-18 21:16:47 UTC <zoomer46> @MSNBC @margaritateresa it's amazing what has become normal. i can't wait to see what happens next.
799020302730719232 2016-11-16 22:44:19 UTC <zoomer46> @DebraMessing i think it is a sequential problem but no biggie, everything will be all right. what does the state dept know anyway?
799018393210855424 2016-11-16 22:36:44 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @zzelda01 so.i am a fifties kind of guy but even i don't use the term...and it's not because i feel pc pressured.
796836598658822144 2016-11-10 22:07:04 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX keep the faith, kid. one day at a time. that's what i try to do but sometimes it's not easy.
796836263177359361 2016-11-10 22:05:44 UTC <zoomer46> @keepingit1600 @margaritateresa i may join you. the way the election was covered makes me want to spend a few years reading fiction.
796357980488925192 2016-11-09 14:25:12 UTC <zoomer46> @KatyTurNBC @MittRomney ah. a republican gentleman.
796122301318201348 2016-11-08 22:48:42 UTC <zoomer46> @chucktodd @KatyTurNBC she should have done the math. not ALL republicans are lunatics.
796113872700710912 2016-11-08 22:15:12 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @danpfeiffer send this ignorance back under a rock where it belongs.
796113576947843076 2016-11-08 22:14:02 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @jonlovett irresponsible.
796113319992115200 2016-11-08 22:13:01 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien @RobynnTysver oh yes.

795576240883253248 2016-11-07 10:38:51 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien so. that's a little strange and vague. my imagination is running wild.
795437589893410816 2016-11-06 01:27:54 UTC <zoomer46> @CLewandowski_ @KatyTurNBC lucky you.

795319836024963074 2016-11-06 17:39:59 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @Kris_Sacrebleu it looks like they do. strange.
795300351780016129 2016-11-06 16:22:34 UTC <zoomer46> @HuffingtonPost oh for crying out loud.

795203721147752448 2016-11-06 09:58:35 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX trump is stuck in emotional high school.
795200477440933888 2016-11-06 09:45:42 UTC <zoomer46> @FionaGillen2013 @DavidCornDC it would have been the gunfight at the ok coral
795198998621679616 2016-11-06 09:39:50 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX slithering. good word.
795022286365540352 2016-11-05 21:57:38 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX this guy is a despicable wanna be politician for hire.
795021828385341440 2016-11-05 21:55:49 UTC <zoomer46> @DebraMessing @ThereWork it's all a big show run by a natural con artist.
794989798926721024 2016-11-05 19:48:32 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @ezlusztig god i hope so.
794899580966043648 2016-11-05 13:50:03 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @neeratanden you may as well vote for trump if you vote for a third party candidate.
794840720528044032 2016-11-05 09:56:09 UTC <zoomer46> @RalstonReports @margaritateresa @ifsmallisall i was hoping that trump's opening gambit against Hispanics would come back to haunt him.
794838718456668161 2016-11-05 09:48:12 UTC <zoomer46> @MotherJones that is really raising the bar.
794665304664264705 2016-11-04 22:19:07 UTC <zoomer46> @Rosie @margaritateresa @ananavarro it would be amazing to me if women do not come out in droves on tueday
794641936070086656 2016-11-04 20:46:15 UTC <zoomer46> @KatyTurNBC @DerekMyers business as usual.

794433078848536576 2016-11-03 06:56:20 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @lesliermyers we all need to make our voices heard and vote to make sure this glorious experiment continues and thrives.

794271039924695040 2016-11-03 20:12:27 UTC <zoomer46> @CcriderJohn The thing is...they will manage to blame Obama.
794269906690772992 2016-11-03 20:07:57 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien yes it was.
793911928984858630 2016-11-02 20:25:28 UTC <zoomer46> @ananavarro @margaritateresa @hollybdc @KatyTurNBC it's an accident waiting to happen.
793911551073914882 2016-11-02 20:23:58 UTC <zoomer46> @neeratanden @margaritateresa this is so incredibly screwed up.
793586449874579456 2016-11-01 22:52:08 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien oh lord.
793582760069849088 2016-11-01 22:37:28 UTC <zoomer46> @marcorubio @margaritateresa i know. i just don't get it.
793567045384302592 2016-11-01 21:35:02 UTC <zoomer46> @marcorubio @margaritateresa the minute he opens his mouth, it's a problem.
793566594555342854 2016-11-01 21:33:14 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien what is this? some kind of sick joke? egg the place.
792859650030968832 2016-10-30 22:44:05 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien raised by wolves or lives under a rock.
792764828205084673 2016-10-30 16:27:18 UTC <zoomer46> @UberFacts i can sleep tonight.
792699293681455104 2016-10-30 12:06:53 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien This is a fine concept. When more people do well it benefits us all. It seems to be a notion that gets lost in the political crossfire.
792662582469484544 2016-10-30 09:41:01 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa It could happen. it is more important than ever to vote. the more voters the better the chances for clinton
792524337270124544 2016-10-29 00:31:41 UTC <zoomer46> @_fllwrs @margaritateresa still met ten.
792523756413542400 2016-10-29 00:29:22 UTC <zoomer46> @JoyAnnReid @margaritateresa @bellatrova oh god helps us
792166962918989824 2016-10-28 00:51:36 UTC <zoomer46> @mitchellvii @soledadobrien a baffling thought process
792159869595967488 2016-10-28 00:23:25 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien @mitchellvii the fact that there is no evidence is proof. Think about it.
791927266372640768 2016-10-28 08:59:08 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien i guess i should go back to South Orange.
791926983903051776 2016-10-28 08:58:00 UTC <zoomer46> @soledadobrien oh boy.
791687193098063873 2016-10-27 17:05:10 UTC <zoomer46> @RobbyMook overconfidence could spoil voter turnout and then the unthinkable may be possible.
791683449979539457 2016-10-27 16:50:17 UTC <zoomer46> @realDonaldTrump @politico ah. nothing works like a bribe.
791681913991860224 2016-10-27 16:44:11 UTC <zoomer46> @MotherJones so. will the world be a better place as a result of this man's presence?
791678917593661440 2016-10-27 16:32:17 UTC <zoomer46> @margaritateresa @HawaiiShira oh lord. what happens after that?
791678738647908353 2016-10-27 16:31:34 UTC <zoomer46> @VABVOX that's a new one or am i out of touch with things?

781589516926722052 2016-09-29 20:20:36 UTC <zoomer46> @politico such a pathetic manoeuvre.
770510535641161728 2016-08-29 06:36:41 UTC <zoomer46> @RebeccaMorin_ @politico Giuliani should just quietly go away. I really don't care what he thinks.
765339838333739009 2016-08-15 00:10:11 UTC <zoomer46> Don't care what Giuliani tries. His political career is over.

706304686765301760 2016-03-05 02:25:34 UTC <zoomer46> The dopey thing is that it is riveting.
705590387952459776 2016-03-03 03:07:12 UTC <zoomer46> It's not funny any more.
