970393506387816448 2018-03-04 20:20:15 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> That defending was straight out of the #readingfc (men) textbook. #GERENG #Lionesses

970279323591639040 2018-03-04 12:46:32 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton It was scarcely hidden!

970269953965346816 2018-03-04 12:09:18 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @virginmedia what's happening with your email service please? Unable to retrieve emails for 2 days now. Other users reporting same issue. Can't even log into my account online. Says incorrect password when it's not
970244976293662720 2018-03-04 10:30:03 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton Thousands of 'Kevins' who have been robbed of opportunities by the nasty #EU immigrants will get off their arses, stop watching (or appearing on) Jeremy Kyle & set to work. May's glorious #Brexit

969648162557317120 2018-03-02 18:58:31 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @mikegalsworthy Of course it is - we are going to get Blue Passports! #BrexitLunacy
968951992042352642 2018-02-28 20:52:11 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Millwall score goal on break, fans celebrate, only to be incensed when #VAR rules out goal & awards penalty against them for incident immediately prior to that break! It may not be Millwall but something like that will happen.
968951056645414912 2018-02-28 20:48:28 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Having seen #VAR mess up MLS games, I can guarantee it will be dropped - probably when it results in crowd trouble in a high tension local derby.
968949596536934400 2018-02-28 20:42:40 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @Eds30 Donald to the rescue! He'll be in there unarmed, once he's had time to finish with his thoughts and prayers.
968944059074179072 2018-02-28 20:20:40 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @nw_nicholas @peckhamcop Thank you for your compassion. The idiots who called you are probably the same ones dialling 999 because they couldn't get their KFC. Doubtless they would also call you for help if they locked themselves out in the cold. #Homeless #ItCouldBeAnyOfUs
968942850997186561 2018-02-28 20:15:52 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> BBC: "The restaurant sector has also faced higher costs for the ingredients it buys overseas due to the drop in the pound since the UK voted to leave the European Union." Another great job done by the 'take back control' #Brexit muppets.
968757504359452672 2018-02-27 07:59:22 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Congratulations to the moron driving the white Nissan Juke through #LBH in the snow without lights on! With brain cells like that it was an incredible feat just finding their way into the driver's seat! #snow
968620515018625024 2018-02-27 22:55:01 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> If the sodding players keep making the wrong decisions at the back, according to Stam, then drop the offenders. Rather see youngsters playing than footballing thickos #readingfc
968619919452622851 2018-02-27 22:52:39 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> So Stam and his medical team put Barrow on the bench even though he wasn't fit to play 'because we had no other options going forward'! Complete and utter incompetent barstewards. #readingfc
968617536509095942 2018-02-27 22:43:11 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC No passion and leadership on the pitch, no passion and leadership amongst the coaching and management staff, no passion and leadership in the boardroom, no passion and leadership from the owners = relegation #readingfc

968604861200728069 2018-02-27 21:52:49 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @willow1871 @TimDellor please ask Stam why Barrow was wasting a space sat on the bench if he wasn't fit enough to replace McCleary. Clueless management. #readingfc
968599669298352128 2018-02-27 21:32:11 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> 50 years of supporting #readingfc & I have never left a game early like tonight. Pointless staying with manager and team performing like this. Now to risk the pavements that @ReadingFC couldn't be arsed to grit ( too busy with pointless bag searches?) Long cold journey home.
968598669367836673 2018-02-27 21:28:13 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @willow1871 @TimDellor please ask Stam whether he would like to apologise to the fans who braved the awful conditions tonight only to be punished by an appalling display by him, his coaching staff & players. #readingfc
968593685456805888 2018-02-27 21:08:24 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC take the players' cars off them & make them use public transport for a month. A night sleeping rough wouldn't hurt them either. They need to be reminded that they need to earn their privileged lifestyles. #readingfc
968591751782064128 2018-02-27 21:00:43 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC tonight I shed my first tear for our relegation. Still I'm sure Royal Elm Park will be lovely. Just a shame our football club was sacrificed for it. #soldout #betrayed #readingfc #ThaiTakeaway
968589145282174976 2018-02-27 20:50:22 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC this is an effing disgrace. We fans brave appalling weather to get to the game (you don't even grit Hurst Way) &!are 'rewarded' by an abysmal display by the manager, coaching staff & players. None seem to give a toss. #readingfc
968581520188420096 2018-02-27 20:20:04 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> If Barrow isn't fit to come on as a sub when McCleary goes off, why the hell is he wasting a space on the bench? Where are Aluko and Swift? #shambolic #readingfc
968576609325387776 2018-02-27 20:00:33 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Worrying absence of any grit up Hurst Way. Really slippery under foot. Disappointing when club are is obsessed with safety elsewhere. #readingfc

967711687997558784 2018-02-25 10:43:40 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> .@jeremycorbyn is not the paragon of virtue some like to claim. Whatever his good points he has let our country down badly & continues to do so over #Brexit. #Labour #Remainers need to stop supporting him until he takes clear positive action to stop the Brexit disaster
967709860870721536 2018-02-25 10:36:24 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> So what happened to the protest walk out at The Mad Stad? I have been watching death throes of recent games from the concourse but was kept in my seat until the final whistle by yesterday's performance. #readingfc
967696347896918017 2018-02-25 09:42:42 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Be under no illusion .@jeremycorbyn is equally to blame for the #Brexit mess we face. 1st his lukewarm support for #EU completely undermined #Remain campaign & now with his failure to speak out as we hurtle towards precipice #Labour Remain need to tell him
967473691683622912 2018-02-24 18:57:57 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> .@EFL Scott Carson runs from his area to the halfway line to assault opponents but escapes with just a yellow?! The officials 'in charge' of today's game were dire. Forget 'respect' that has to be earned. #readingfc #PGMO
967471158240169984 2018-02-24 18:47:53 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> So according to the #NRA we should blame everything and everyone, apart from the NRA & the virtual gun anarchy they argue for, for all of the US shootings. #FloridaShootings #NoRationalArguments
967440722612969472 2018-02-24 16:46:57 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Carson runs to halfway line and throws a punch but escapes with a yellow! Absolute shyte officials. #EFL #readingfc
967427063828402176 2018-02-24 15:52:40 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Derby keeper punched Barrow in the body when lining up for corner but both ref & West Stand Lino missed it even though watching scuffles #readingfc
967426654606954502 2018-02-24 15:51:03 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Ref and East Stand Lino are shyte. Jerome repeatedly knocking/shoving our defenders in the back before ball reaches them, causing them to miss headers but officials take no action. #readingfc
967423600209940480 2018-02-24 15:38:54 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Yet again we concede because we give away a stupid freekick in a dangerous position which we then can't defend! Both Derby goals have been gifted to them #readingfc
967410990794059776 2018-02-24 14:48:48 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Seen it all now.

967123351247388672 2018-02-23 19:45:49 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TomMoore0506 @DTerryOUFC None at all? Regardless of that be very wary of any claims of funding and ambition for your club. They grabbed our land & then seemed to have insufficient funds to continue supporting the football club.
967122674915905541 2018-02-23 19:43:08 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> It stinks that #Trump is criticising someone for being a coward. Regardless of the conduct of Peterson, who seriously believes that in the same situation Trump would've rushed in putting his life on the line?  #Floridashooting
966768967779004418 2018-02-22 20:17:38 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TomMoore0506 Wonder who owns the land around the Kassam Stadium? Is he interested in the football or the real estate development opportunities? Tiger could prove as welcome at #OUFC as Captain Bob Maxwell was in the vicinity of #readingfc
966767950626684930 2018-02-22 20:13:35 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TheTilehurstEnd Have Oxford got some land to develop then? Perhaps they should have spoken to a few people at #readingfc about his 'financial resources' & drive to deliver club's ambitions! #OUFC

966422778445430784 2018-02-21 21:22:00 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @Liz_Wheeler You've missed out machine gun posts in schools you lunatic. If too many guns isn't the cause of the ridiculous number of gun deaths in the US then it must be the mindset of your citizens. That's the logical conclusion of your mad argument.
966421853655846912 2018-02-21 21:18:19 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Can't believe #BCLFC keep leaving Fara Williams completely unmarked at corners. Has cost them two goals now. Haven't they seen her shoot from range?! #ReadingFCWomen

965333317414457349 2018-02-18 21:12:52 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @EFL @SkyBet What a crap poll when you don't even feature Steve Coppell!  The record of 106 points + 99 goals categorically answers your question. #readingfc
965166390612283398 2018-02-18 10:09:34 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @RealJamesWoods But Americans kill far more, and more effectively, with their guns. Shame you and others are too dumb to spot that. Or do you guys just value life less? #FloridaShooting
965165800008110081 2018-02-18 10:07:13 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @RealJamesWoods So the US has one of the highest rates of mass shootings/killings  in the world. That has to be down to either a lack of adequate gun controls or the mental state of their citizens. Which is it? #FloridaShooting

961711608971124736 2018-02-08 21:21:29 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @DanielJHannan I see the #Brexit liars are still lying through their teeth & no doubt the ill-educated & ignorant will still believe them. Absolute BS to claim pound is back to where it was before the referendum.

Truth be told, few feel strongly enough re Stam to stay & protest afterwards! #readingfc
961356770970079232 2018-02-07 21:51:30 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @theresa_may This coming from an utterly ineffective leader who uses Whips and other threats to intimidate her MPs into voting to support her. For God's sake go May & don't you dare attempt to silence through legislation those who oppose you ..

960141702601244672 2018-02-04 13:23:15 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TalkReading Blackett is still only 23. At that age your experience of life is limited & it's pretty tough dealing with treatment like that. Any fathers who joined in the booing should be ashamed of themselves. How would they like their kids treated like that? #readingfc
960099714707480576 2018-02-04 10:36:24 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TomBarclay_ 2+2 surely =5. If you were sacking your manager you'd presumably want the players assembled in one place e.g. at the training ground so you could tell them all at once what was happening. Anything else would be shambolic but maybe that is #readingfc at present.
960088827980386304 2018-02-04 09:53:08 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @liammoore93 please tell Tyler Blackett to keep his head up. Only idiots boo their own players, particularly younger players, in that way. Everyone makes mistakes in their jobs including those booing.
959914137420812288 2018-02-03 22:18:59 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @brexitblog_info #Tory cheats and their favourite rag ignoring the fact that the video evidence clearly shows one of the disgusting .@Jacob_Rees_Mogg thugs in a white shirt throwing the punches.
959876312314900480 2018-02-03 19:48:41 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> These are desperate times but some of the suggested replacements for Stam are crazy. The fact someone was once a Royals favourite doesn't qualify them to be a successful Championship manager, particularly given the dreadful position #readingfc are in
959873448104390659 2018-02-03 19:37:18 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @BBCNews @PeterStefanovi2 And yet the hypocritical #Tories take us as stupid and try to convince us that the #BBC is biased towards the left!
959863557746843648 2018-02-03 18:58:00 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ElmParkRoyals @Mr_Mc_Goo I thought JvDB played well too and at least looked like he cared.
959852758970052608 2018-02-03 18:15:05 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @UKLabour @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @BBCNews @JuliaHB1 @carol_hulme @timmitchell55 When talking about thugs & fascists suggest you look at your own party first. 'Forced their way in'??! Doesn't look like it. As for free speech #Tory gagging laws/measures? You're yet another #Tory hypocrite & I'm not a fan of Labour either.
959850638543695872 2018-02-03 18:06:40 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC I can take losses and possibly even relegation but I can no longer take anymore of the team's mind-numbingly boring football. 0 shots in first half at home is utterly unacceptable. Despite season tickets, its @ReadingFCWomen from now on + save parking at 10 #readingfc
959849371780239360 2018-02-03 18:01:38 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC Despite pointless & irritating bag searches etc @readingfc still don't detect flares being brought in! Quite frankly, at present, we're at greater risk of dying from boredom in the stadium than any other cause. #readingfc
959848746770161664 2018-02-03 17:59:09 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC @readingfc you're haemorrhaging customers so why pee them off even more with pointless bag searches before entering MegaStore? Unlike you, terrorists have realised they don't need to risk getting caught by entering venues. They act outside. #readingfc
959847408892088320 2018-02-03 17:53:50 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Stam has to carry a lot of blame but decision to sub Blackett was right. Needed to make change to try to get goals & to protect Blackett from his own fans. @TimDellor said game was gone but would've been first to complain if we had given up completely at 2-0 #readingfc
959846681742315521 2018-02-03 17:50:56 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @willow1871 I'm not sure why you're picking on the defence so much when they end up having to defend 0 in virtually every game. Its our non creative & shot shy midfield & 'strike force' who are really letting us down. #readingfc
959828060697743360 2018-02-03 16:36:57 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC @readingfc I've  stuck by Stam up until now but enough is enough. His team selection, formation & tactics lost us the game today. What's more the football is utterly boring. Another day of my life wasted. It's the women's team from now on. #readingfc

959787871250108417 2018-02-03 13:57:15 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> .@Jacob_Rees_Mogg is a typical Old Etonian #Tory bully boy picking on those unable to defend themselves. His scandalous & completely unfounded allegations against civil servants are a disgrace. Looking forward to when, like most bullies, he meets his match. #Brexit
959733994001764353 2018-02-03 10:23:09 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Bigoted deceitful scum like .@Jacob_Rees_Mogg & their disgraceful & unfounded allegations will destroy our democratic society. I for one don't want to live in the type of society they are driving towards. #Brexit #civilservants

959140591719407616 2018-02-01 19:05:11 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> This story really brought home to me how evil and callous the #Tory mob currently ruining, rather than running, our country are.

957718156289691648 2018-01-28 20:52:56 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @willow1871 Having seen it operate in MLS I fully agree. Atlanta Utd game. Save led to corner, only for VAR to award pen at other end prior to break which led to save. What if goal had been scored, only to be ruled out for prior pen?! 1 goal up to 1 down!
957659929027993600 2018-01-28 17:01:34 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Congratulations .@gracemoloney on a great game today v Arsenal with some excellent saves. A major contributor to the point and we could've had more. #ReadingFCWomen

955047952887795714 2018-01-21 12:02:30 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> .@British_Airways when are you cutting ticket prices to match the appallingly slow self-service budget model that #AlexCruz has driven in? Fed up with paying premium prices 4 his shoddy service. Now testing loyalty Destroying reputation of national brand airline. #BritishAirways
955046155578200064 2018-01-21 11:55:22 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> .@British_Airways Not impressed by your LHR T5 telling my daughter to go to self-serve baggage drop 'as quicker' when that was patently untrue. Quite clear you're trying to force customers into complying with Cruz's cost cutting. If we want budget service we'd fly #Easyjet
955044693372555265 2018-01-21 11:49:33 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @WhichUK Are #BritishAirways deliberately showing seats as taken when they're not, in order to panic people into paying to reserve seats? 48hrs before few seats showing available so paid to reserve 2 together. 20hrs before, plane changed, smaller cabin but numerous free seats!

954795035979075585 2018-01-20 19:17:30 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Gourlay said we couldn't do much in transfer window due to FFP. Today Stam said we can't do much in the window because the money isn't available. There's a big & important difference between the two. Which is the true reason? #readingfc
954785143859933185 2018-01-20 18:38:12 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Staggered by claims from Stam out brigade that 'today was no better', 'there was no urgency' & 'players didn't show passion' On latter point Jon Dadi dropped to knees & hammered ground with fists when we conceded.

954743079130542080 2018-01-20 15:51:02 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> This ref is an utter twat. JvDB yellow was an incredibly soft yellow - tussling for ball with player going nowhere.

What if that is when a goal scored in a big derby? VAR then shows there should've been pen at other end before counter 4 goal.  VAR disallows celebrated goal, opponents score pen = uproar!

948469181212774401 2018-01-03 08:20:49 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MagicaIMoore To me it suggests that he still really cares about performances and results. He still clearly cares about #readingfc but that doesn't mean he won't accept a move if the right offer comes in for him & club accepts it
948467236041297920 2018-01-03 08:13:05 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Did Steven Reid contribute far more to our success than we realised at the time? Does Stam now have the right coaching team around him? Did Stam stop listening to Reid? #readingfc
948462842931482624 2018-01-02 07:55:37 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Stam pointed to the failure to defend the free kick that led to their 1st as the reason for our troubles but it was McShane's absolute stupidity in needlessly conceding that free kick in a dangerous position that was the real issue #readingfc
948461507465146368 2018-01-02 07:50:19 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Once again our failure to convert chances cost us dear last night. 12 shots, 5 on target & hit woodwork. That was the difference between the two teams. Need players who can score regularly. #readingfc

948330323825299456 2018-01-02 23:09:02 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> If Stam is staying, he needs help. Would he listen to Sir Steve Coppell? #readingfc
948329074363195392 2018-01-02 23:04:05 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Jaap Stam will have turned even more supporters against him through his extremely ill-considered and tactless responses to @TimDellor  in tonight's post match interview #readingfc
948328424669622272 2018-01-02 23:01:30 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> If Liam Moore leaves in this window we are as good as relegated. He is the only true leader we have on the pitch and always gives 100%. Also looks more gutted than rest of team when we lose. #readingfc
948327897378508801 2018-01-02 22:59:24 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Defence aren't great but it's our failure to convert chances & score that's killing us. Tevreden & owners let us down badly by failing to ensure we signed a decent striker #readingfc
948327055267192838 2018-01-02 22:56:03 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Those who said it was absolute folly to rely completely on the return of Kermorgant have sadly been proved right. It was also ridiculous to let the strikers that we did have go without replacements. #readingfc
948309312329437184 2018-01-02 21:45:33 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Should add Clement and JvDB to those who seemed to care but both subbed! #readingfc
948308805523312640 2018-01-02 21:43:32 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Moore, Bacuna and Swift seem like they care. Not sure how many others. #readingfc
948308040050184193 2018-01-02 21:40:30 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Some of our players should hang their heads with shame the way they have played tonight. Thoroughly unprofessional. Senior players like McShane and Kermorgant repeatedly conceding silly fouls. #readingfc
948307319615643648 2018-01-02 21:37:38 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> I wonder if Stam might surprise people by resigning. #readingfc
948300207674019841 2018-01-02 21:09:22 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Abuse being dished out because, regardless of our thoughts on our manager, some of us still think it's important to support the team rather than hope they lose #readingfc
948298387299930115 2018-01-02 21:02:08 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> I'm beginning to think Stam is like McDermott - can achieve great things through spirit and togetherness of squad but when that disappears doesn't have another effective approach. #readingfc
948296391259979779 2018-01-02 20:54:12 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @adsavory But what you've stated isn't completely true is it?! Stockdale has had to make at least three very good saves. #readingfc
948290707151826944 2018-01-02 20:31:37 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @LordCKS So you want the team you claim to support to lose just so you can have your own way?!  Nose & face spring to mind, as does childish.  #readingfc
948289393571352577 2018-01-02 20:26:24 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> On current form, sadly McShane is more of a liability than an asset. Stupid free kick needlessly conceded leads to Birmingham scoring. Time to give Ilori another chance. #readingfc
948288386271498242 2018-01-02 20:22:24 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Getting pissed off with our defenders playing sloppy passes. McShane passed into touch when Gunter was less than 10yds away and JvDB just played hospital ball to Moore. Concentrate! #readingfc
948282227443621889 2018-01-02 19:57:55 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> OMG people are pissed off because the club's Chief Executive isn't running around screaming 'We're doomed' to the media and fans! Thank god he's got a clear calm head. #teadingfc

945798521726341126 2017-12-26 23:28:34 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> To be fair, if it comes down to Bristol City or their Welsh neighbours going up, I would see our 'gift' of 6 points to City as a worthwhile investment. If they stay down, we'll collect them back next season! #readingfc
945793341995790337 2017-12-26 23:07:59 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @UcantTEACHitDB It lucky that Barrow didn't end up wearing a plaster cast the way some off your thugs kicked him up in the air.

945720472276226048 2017-12-26 18:18:25 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @James_FIynn Very conveniently ignoring the key point Stam made! They only  scored those 2 goals cos they took their chances. That very important (& sadly typical) factor was the difference. Otherwise I thought we were equally as good or better than them & definitely not as cynical #readingfc
945719379379056640 2017-12-26 18:14:05 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Once again the Stam out mob are vocal but none of the potential replacements being mentioned are exactly short of their fair share of failures. #readingfc

945717358886379523 2017-12-26 18:06:03 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> The main difference between the two teams today - Bristol City players take every opportunity to fire in shots on goal and get many on target. We can't keep defending nil! #readingfc
945716814901891072 2017-12-26 18:03:53 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Look forward to Bristol City crying in the playoffs. A good team but Lee Johnson has developed a thoroughly nasty cynical side to their play. Blatant dives & countless cynical fouls to break down all counter attacks #readingfc
945715949658886145 2017-12-26 18:00:27 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> You know it's a shit ref when both sets of fans are telling him so. Completely bottled 2nd yellow for Pack when he wiped out Barrow with appalling challenge. Missed clear pen when Kermorgant held down. #readingfc

944647932292272128 2017-12-23 19:16:32 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> I still dont want Stam sacked but am struggling to understand why Edwards was taken off today. Also, whilst he remains great defensively, currently Kermorgant isn't good enough up front. JDB should have been brought on earlier. #readingfc
944646857149571072 2017-12-23 19:12:16 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton Nor does it make him bad. But still, supporters who have never played nor managed at that level clearly know better than successive Reading and Wales managers. #Gunter #Scapegoat
944644696810369024 2017-12-23 19:03:41 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> If (when?) Liam Moore leaves in January talk of relegation will no longer appear to be mere scaremongering #readingfc
944640381605613568 2017-12-23 18:46:32 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC @willow1871 @simply_langers Season tickets only save you money if you can get to most of the games. We miss at least 5-6 a season due to work commitments & Sky changing times. We still buy season tickets out of (misguided?) loyalty & commitment. #readingfc
944639590941503488 2017-12-23 18:43:23 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ScottSandover No, what happens when highly paid 'professionals' can't be arsed to concentrate for 90 minutes! The sloppiness and piss poor attitude from most of our players today was an absolute disgrace! Yet Edwards was the one taken off first! #readingfc
944638887133052930 2017-12-23 18:40:35 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @thepileus Perhaps #BCFC would care to donate some of the 32 from each #readingfc fan they are ripping off on Boxing Day to helping the countless homeless people on their City's streets.
944638377936211968 2017-12-23 18:38:34 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton Leave off! He was by no means the worst of our players today.
944638099698716672 2017-12-23 18:37:28 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC when the team arrive in Bristol tomorrow they should be made to walk round the city centre to see the just how many homeless there are. Today's performance didn't merit their extremely privileged lifestyle. #readingfc
944627464655040512 2017-12-23 17:55:12 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC @willow1871 @simply_langers Normally I'd agree but as this was to mark the 500th game I think it would've been nice if the club had rewarded its most loyal fans too. Maybe a Megastore voucher? @readingfc Anyway I was pointing out to Adi that some paid >5 he kept mentioning for that dross

941378545565290499 2017-12-14 18:45:09 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @BritishGasHelp absolutely no reason other than penny pinching that you can't employ more call centre staff during winter to personally handle cancelled appointments, rather than pee customers off by text. Got to wait till Feb 2018?! #Homecare #poorservice #ripoff lost customer
941377495118548993 2017-12-14 18:40:59 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @WhichUK Don't waste your money on #BritishGas #Homecare. They'll take your money & fail to deliver.

If theres that much backlog then your bosses' complete inability to predict demand in winter is astounding.Or are #BritishGas choosing to cash in on call outs at expense of #Homecare routine services?
941070920877211648 2017-12-13 22:22:46 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @BritishGasHelp Not your fault personally but BG should be less greedy & either employ more technicians (on overtime or annual hours contracts) or take on less customers so that you can cover winter peak demand. Unacceptable to treat prepaid customers this way. #Homecare #BritishGas #poorservice
941069099802726401 2017-12-13 22:15:32 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Isn't it great when a major decision on #Brexit is carried by a tiny minority. Will the Brexiteers now insist that further votes would be un democratic?  #amendment7
941052261760929792 2017-12-13 21:08:37 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @BritishGasHelp Looks like you need more staff or less customers. You know winter gets incredibly busy. My wife booked time off for this appointment, so unless you can do the next day it won't help. Pointless continuing to pay for #Homecare You've taken money for nothing #BritishGas #poorservice
941049574742986753 2017-12-13 20:57:57 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> The pathetic Daily Torygraph will no doubt start their #Brexit traitor shyte again. The true traitors are they and the other lying Tory media. It is they that are destroying democracy and damaging the UK with their deceit. #DailyTelegraph

896648194662248448 2017-08-13 08:22:43 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @LordCKS Take you blinkers off & watch it properly. All he could've done is cheat with a rugby tackle for red card. Stam pointed finger at JvDB & TB

896428777206685696 2017-08-12 17:50:49 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @RFC_Phil @ElmParkRoyals Simple - Because he was getting no where near him without diving in like that. Piazon was away. #letsblamegunter
896427732229382148 2017-08-12 17:46:40 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @B3rt1e But ultimately it was a season that ended in failure, largely due to failings I mentioned. Lack of concentration  particularly indefensible

896425369724735488 2017-08-12 17:37:17 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> If we're not going to sign a decent striker then Stam has to get rest of team reacting & shooting like hungry goalscorers #readingfc

863494801156714497 2017-05-13 20:42:58 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @maffff @fholker To be fair you were by far the best team for most of the abandoned game. Fortunately Jaap is a quick learner
863494155531636737 2017-05-13 20:40:24 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC @martinfife Agree on all of that
863493800597041152 2017-05-13 20:38:59 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @maffff @kingscrossed No matter what you else you claim re #readingfc you look seriously deranged suggesting they don't like to pass the ball on the ground #ffc
863493136814919680 2017-05-13 20:36:21 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Perhaps someone would care to explain why, if #ffc were .'clearly the better side' they weren't good enough to win even v 10 men #readingfc
863492368158400512 2017-05-13 20:33:18 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Fact: Managers get paid to get results with the resources they have. If Jaap stays #readingfc will play more attractively next season #ffc
863488069206499328 2017-05-13 20:16:13 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @maffff @AndyGlockner But even Sky acknowledged #readingfc were taking game to #ffc early on & also after scoring. Only really parked bus after red #readingfc
863487635536347136 2017-05-13 20:14:29 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @maffff @AndyGlockner Sky commentary team reckoned Williams didn't handle & should've had penalty. Studio saw handling incident differently Ignored pen #readingfc
863486990964150273 2017-05-13 20:11:56 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @maffff @AndyGlockner Thank god #ffc do have some reasonably objective fans. Prepared to debate our bad points with them. No complaints re red. #readingfc
863486397558259712 2017-05-13 20:09:34 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @maffff @AndyGlockner At last a #ffc fan who actually realises that results count more than media hype, bookies odds & 'pretty' football #readingfc
863485224159764482 2017-05-13 20:04:54 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @richrparry @maffff @Reidyffc Wonder whether you'll really believe that if #readingfc go up. Too blind to notice they also play god football
863484796160356354 2017-05-13 20:03:12 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> #loads of #ffc fans clearly rattled by the result. Not good enough to beat anti-football little old #readingfc shouldn't have believed hype
863484167241293825 2017-05-13 20:00:42 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC @martinfife We take loads of time on throws even when losing. Shouldn't have stopped mighty free scoring #ffc Fell for own hype #sourgrapes #readingfc
863483550233964544 2017-05-13 19:58:15 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @maffff @kingscrossed Should've gone to Specsavers you might also then have spotted the penalty Williams should've been given #ffc #sourgrapes #readingfc

863481143873720320 2017-05-13 19:48:42 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Surely our supposed timewasting would've only restricted mighty free scoring favourites #ffc to four goals? Pooed pants at 1-0 #readingfc
863479449223823360 2017-05-13 19:41:58 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @_HollyBliss @JackSla84 Suggest you improve your knowledge of our squad before picking our team for us! #readingfc

784056004656914432 2016-10-06 15:41:33 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Wonder whether #UKIP MEPs enjoy free treatment in #EU hospitals? #hypocrites #liars #parasites
784055282267742208 2016-10-06 15:38:40 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> And by the way folks, you won't need to come to the US to experience that 21% price increase in anything traded in $. #Brexit #lies #madness
784054017034973184 2016-10-06 15:33:39 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> .@BorisJohnson I'd love to meet to tell U a few home truths, although I realise U struggle with concept of 'truth'. Got guts or just lies?
784052885663391745 2016-10-06 15:29:09 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Today my $30 shop cost me 5.01 more than a year ago, largely due to .@BorisJohnson , his fellow #Brexit liars & fools that believed them.
783768758997450752 2016-10-05 20:40:08 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Thou shalt not give work to #foreign #workers,  unless thou art this #Tory Government dishing out lucrative contracts to foreign companies
783767948922122241 2016-10-05 20:36:55 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> So in the interests of balance are the #Tories going to declare how many British workers' jobs they have given to cheaper foreign companies?
783490209530933248 2016-10-04 02:13:17 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Facts rather than #Tory xenophobic crap. Jobs paying well over minimum wage. Brits still couldn't be arsed to turn up, #EU workers could.
783433951184551936 2016-10-04 22:29:44 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @B3rt1e what an intelligent, well reasoned, response. Says so much. I guess you would have been admiring the emperor's  new clothes.
783433165599899648 2016-10-04 22:26:36 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Do #Tories & their moronic followers really think that companies go out of their way to employ #foreigners?! UK workforce leaves no choice
783432456582139905 2016-10-04 22:23:47 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Clearly the #Tories fail to realise that lists of foreign employees are more a shameful reflection of successive UK govt failings than e/ers
783431589976039424 2016-10-04 22:20:21 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> So first #Tories make it difficult for Brits to afford to gain technology degrees then tell technology companies they must employ Brits!

774993115140743168 2016-09-11 15:28:51 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Interesting that supporters of Chelsea's women's team appear to have developed same arrogance as those of men's team! #readingfcwomen
774985208579915776 2016-09-11 14:57:26 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Clear foul in build up to 2nd Chelsea goal but ref who earned no #Respect with his poor performance  2day chose to ignore it #readingfcwomen
774952431608266752 2016-09-11 12:47:12 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> How come we are in our away kit? Did Chelsea turn up without theirs? #readingfcwomen
774921879597543425 2016-09-11 10:45:48 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Just as was the case with many who voted #Brexit it is now becoming abundantly clear our incompetent Govt doesn't know what it is doing. #EU
774641418153390081 2016-09-10 16:11:20 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Why do some drive like Twats when it's raining. Idiots crashed on #A404 & brought it to a standstill. Learn to drive properly
774545037048836096 2016-09-10 09:48:21 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Give it a year and the big boys will come calling for #Jaap A superb manager in the making. Hope we have him on a good contract #readingfc
774544570352820224 2016-09-10 09:46:30 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Superb post match iv by #Jaap on Sky. Articulate, insightful, logical, diplomatic - didn't fall for trap question re fans #topman #readingfc

774375667383332866 2016-09-09 22:35:20 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @SteveG1871 definitely the latter. Same fools criticised ref & said he was wrong to order retake of FK that didn't leave our area #readingfc
774375249701928961 2016-09-09 22:33:41 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> .@gmccleary12 I'm sorry but it was for real. Unfortunately we have a village full of footballing idiots bred on hoofball #readingfc
774374217517240324 2016-09-09 22:29:35 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> The only thing I didn't enjoy about that game was the footballing illiterates going when we rightly passed ball around the back #readingfc

774329748113747968 2016-09-09 19:32:52 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> The same morons are now claiming A-H can play free kick to team mate in his own area! #readingfc
774329058737975297 2016-09-09 19:30:08 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> And that you ignorant morons is why you don't yell at A-H to kick long. You straight away lose possession & have to defend! #readingfc
774323711327477760 2016-09-09 19:08:53 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> East Stand lino having a mare, earlier failed to spot free kick from A-H hadn't left area! Ref blew up next time it happened! #readingfc
774322710075801600 2016-09-09 19:04:54 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> East Stand lino just flagged for offside from a throw, rightly ignored by ref! How can that incompetence command #respect #readingfc

771446639634616320 2016-09-01 20:36:26 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Couple of pieces of excessive gamesmanship from Liverpool prior to our penalty (barging taker) & after they scored (laces) #ReadingFCWomen

771058308778254337 2016-08-31 18:53:21 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts Reason we couldn't get main targets? Our definition of 'competitive offer' doesn't match the market's definition? #readingfc

770962148327579648 2016-08-31 12:31:14 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts massive failure & mistake by #readingfc if they fail to sign striker today. Goal drought, grim times & higher prices in Jan
770713363307429888 2016-08-30 20:02:39 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts @Quinniesta It's not a question of not trusting Charles, it's whether Charles has been told the full truth. 8 wks to fitness?
770708041020956677 2016-08-30 19:41:30 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts @Quinniesta but surely Charles can only report what he is told? May not always be told full truth. Nothing against him.
770703521020776448 2016-08-30 19:23:33 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TimDellor @halliday_9 I beg your pardon. Didn't seem too 'united' last season though. Looking forward to continuing to be honoured.

770694011476709377 2016-08-30 18:45:45 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> On reflection I find it incredible that a professional footballer has become so unfit as to require 8 wks to get to full fitness #readingfc

747135729894047748 2016-06-26 18:33:33 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ravisomaiya @JANUSZCZAK @harikunzru Surely rather than playing cricket he should be working out a plan to deal with #Brexit mess he created
747132900768944128 2016-06-26 18:22:19 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Having proved U can fool some of the people all of the time #Brexit leaders scrambling to distance themselves from 350Mpw 'mistake' aka lie
747112426445934592 2016-06-26 17:00:57 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> .@BorisJohnson right, so you don't have a plan? Didn't think that far ahead? Thought as much. Lied & scaremongered but didn't plan. #Brexit
747111987209977856 2016-06-26 16:59:13 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> .@BorisJohnson So come on, what is your plan to get the UK out of the mess you & your 350M lies have created? Surely you have one? #Brexit

747050059565514752 2016-06-26 12:53:08 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> So if Bonkers Boris, Gormless Gove, racist Farage & Deadwood Smith weren't behind  350M pw #Brexit lie who was? Yes #Brexit is 'a mistake'
747046531681890304 2016-06-26 12:39:07 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> My vote on the petition came from outside the UK - so what? I have a postal vote & was abroad. Less fraudulent than #Brexit #StrongerIn
747024373090029568 2016-06-26 11:11:04 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> If you voted #Brexit as a protest but now regret your actions, write and tell your MP. The referendum was 'Advisory' not binding #StrongerIn

747022035012956160 2016-06-26 11:01:46 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Do those who voted #Brexit realise just how much money the UK will now waste in the legalities of leaving the #EU ? &BTW there is no 350Mpw
746954414930419712 2016-06-25 06:33:04 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @growurselfhappy @STrekaak the #Brexit vote could well reignite the troubles in NI so far less a lie than 350M a week 'a mistake' Farage

746803074711289857 2016-06-25 20:31:42 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Farage now admits 350M to EU figure was 'a mistake'. Sadly he & fellow #Brexit liars had already fooled some of the people all of the time
746801243255865344 2016-06-25 20:24:25 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Forget 'reincarnated as an Olive' #Boris will come back as a dog turd. Cynically lied & destroyed UK to further own career. #scum #Brexit

746793014027161601 2016-06-25 19:51:43 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @David_Cameron you fool. Shouldn't allow far reaching constitutional change that could threaten future of UK on a simple majority #Brexit
746791463166476288 2016-06-25 19:45:34 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Quite happy for any #Brexit voters to block me. Facts & truth are wasted on them anyway. They favour blatant Boris, Gove & Farage lies
746789836107874304 2016-06-25 19:39:06 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @David_Cameron you & fellow self-interested politicians Boris, Gove & Farage have destroyed the UK. May you all rot in hell. #Brexit
746788806980820992 2016-06-25 19:35:00 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Gove's own dad declared him a liar re EU effect on family business & yet people still believed him re #Brexit ?! Astounding stupidity #EUref

746453656564793344 2016-06-24 21:23:14 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> London should join Scotland and declare independence from the #Brexit fools in the rest of the UK. Let them sink on their own. #EUreferendum
746427344802328577 2016-06-24 19:38:41 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> The British turkeys just voted to have Christmas early. #Brexit #EUReferendum
746427053004591105 2016-06-24 19:37:32 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Trump saying we did the right thing tends to suggest #Brexit vote was insanity
746339020771229697 2016-06-24 13:47:43 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> If you're struggling to keep afloat,  the last thing you should do is cut a hole in the bottom of your boat! #Brexit #EUreferendum
746337280898408451 2016-06-24 13:40:48 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> The irony of Boris & Gove being left to clear up the shit they've created would be funny, but for the fact they're incompetent twats #Brexit
746336845714194433 2016-06-24 13:39:04 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Great job #Brexit fools! Expect to see the London Stock Exchange disappear now & London become an insignificant city in global terms
746332798139531264 2016-06-24 13:22:59 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @iVoteStay Actually referendum was only advisory so Parliament can ignore the views of the ignorant #Brexit fools
746332425295269888 2016-06-24 13:21:31 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Everyone who voted #Brexit should be confident enough to declare their names. Then we can hold them accountable later.

726398414137733120 2016-04-30 13:10:52 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @davemc_exile haven't hammered him at any time unlike those with Vydra witch hunt. But he's another not delivered what's needed #readingfc
726397649985871872 2016-04-30 13:07:50 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @davemc_exile  no one else to play due to another poor Jan window. I wouldn't have let Sa go. Kermorgant older, slower version #readingfc
726386695281725440 2016-04-30 12:24:18 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC you sold our player of the season, didn't properly replace him & we've struggled (even more) for goals ever since #readingfc
726385857012326401 2016-04-30 12:20:58 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @davemc_exile he was signed to score goals. We have plenty of players who work hard & link up well. That's not enough in striker #readingfc
726383985455173632 2016-04-30 12:13:32 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @davemc_exile plenty spent on blank firing Kermorgant too. Fee + wages and he's with us next season too. #readingfc
726382994903195648 2016-04-30 12:09:36 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Any chance our 'big money signing' striker Kermorgant might actually score today? #readingfc
726368153480126465 2016-04-30 11:10:37 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @StuLuxLisbon well that's saved me the trouble of signing up to Netflix! Thanks for the review/warning.

726129216857735168 2016-04-29 19:21:10 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> God help us. From frying pan straight into furnace of hell! - Hammond gone No idea Howe taking over as Director of Football. #readingfc
725810377452310529 2016-04-28 22:14:13 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @AsdaServiceTeam quite frankly your home shopping team were as useful as a chocolate tea pot! All excuses no help at all. #poorservice #asda
725809641809137664 2016-04-28 22:11:18 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @AsdaServiceTeam I did. They took  view no harm done as I had only been charged for smaller quantity! Useless response! #poorservice #asda
725713793171492866 2016-04-28 15:50:26 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @AsdaServiceTeam @asda First & last time will use you for online shopping when you just send what you please #poorservice #asda #onlineshop
725709803864100864 2016-04-28 15:34:34 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @AsdaServiceTeam @asda Not acceptable to say short order without notification is OK cos you haven't charged full amount! #Asda #poorservice
725709490344058882 2016-04-28 15:33:20 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @AsdaServiceTeam @asda so U think it's acceptable to send short order without contacting customer first to check if OK?! #poorservice #Asda
725412118380556288 2016-04-27 19:51:41 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> I hope McDermott and, more importantly, those above him realise that the Leicester fairytale wasn't written on the cheap! #readingfc
725377937638350850 2016-04-27 17:35:51 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Today The Sun proved it doesn't even qualify as 'gutter press'. Falls far beneath that. #Liars #TheSun #Noshame #Hillsborough
725068295880192000 2016-04-26 21:05:27 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Who are the 'many people' Hunt refers to as questioning #juniordoctors strike? He's clearly completely deluded. #NHS #SackHunt
724684344023982080 2016-04-25 19:39:46 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts so he couldn't have googled #readingfc 'management from above' on plane over. Hence insufficient due diligence
724677404564840449 2016-04-25 19:12:11 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts when Clarke referred to inadequate due diligence surely he meant 'the management from above' not just financials? #readingfc
724322553079189504 2016-04-24 19:42:08 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Was fortunate to see @orlandoseale and The Swell support @LuxLisbonMusic. A gr8 live band. If U get chance to see them grab it #orlandoseale
724318628083077121 2016-04-24 19:26:32 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @LuxLisbonMusic 1st time I've seen you live and definitely won't be the last. Fantastic gig, really enjoyed it. Even better live. #LuxLisbon
724317740882907137 2016-04-24 19:23:01 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFCWomen great result. Well done ladies. Being disappointed with a draw shows how far team has come & high ambitions #ReadingFCWomen
723968499073355776 2016-04-23 20:15:15 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> If you struggle to score it's essential you keep clean sheets. How many have we had since McDermott returned? #readingfc #notimproving
723967419237146624 2016-04-23 20:10:58 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Yet another soft goal conceded. If we actually have someone coaching our defence it's time he was fired! #readingfc
723911429078802432 2016-04-23 16:28:28 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Maybe Winkelman will seek a quicker return to the Championship by buying another team?! #franchisefc
723910153599344640 2016-04-23 16:23:24 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> No wonder the club is going backwards when so many set the bar of success at 'not losing' & 'not being relegated' What ambition?! #readingfc
723904357729730560 2016-04-23 16:00:23 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @willow1871 no. Defence still in the Christmas spirit of giving, so why defensive at end? Attack best form of defence at present #readingfc
723073627407695872 2016-04-21 08:59:21 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @LuxLisbonMusic  fantastic. Thanks. Really looking forward to it. All the best for it.
723069524795375618 2016-04-21 08:43:03 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @LuxLisbonMusic  can you please remind me what time you are likely to be on stage tonight? Need to plan journey! Many thanks
722885261856628738 2016-04-20 20:30:51 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @CheChe_Guevara I have the misfortune of driving in  US quite regularly & standard of driving of some truck drivers is horrendous. Fatigue?
722872293576282112 2016-04-20 19:39:19 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts so u reckon the tight Thais will allow 2-3M in summer to sort our squad out?! Might just be OK for L1 in 2017/18 #readingfc
722713337667198976 2016-04-20 09:07:41 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Reading fan of over 40yrs & former club VP at Elm Park now choosing not to go to games! That's the Thai, JM, NH x2 & BM effect! #readingfc

722549111153668096 2016-04-19 22:15:07 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @joedavey1996 there are numerous examples. How long do you want to give this one trick pony? Time to take us down next season? #readingfc
722548724048773125 2016-04-19 22:13:34 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @joedavey1996 we are not at the level we should be. At level we deserve to be due to crap management on & off pitch. Crowds drop #readingfc
722548113072922625 2016-04-19 22:11:09 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @StuartFenton17 @charles_watts who cares? Club is screwed anyway under current ownership & management on and off pitch.
722547689326579712 2016-04-19 22:09:28 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @joedavey1996 sorry that is rubbish. Good managers improve what they inherit. Look at Warnock. Blind faith in BM will cost dear #readingfc
722547333464997890 2016-04-19 22:08:03 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TomWelland @NeilWillby @charles_watts sweet FA use when we continue on the slide and McDermott won't play youngsters. #readingfc
722546979100864512 2016-04-19 22:06:38 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Club refuse to grant @charles_watts permission to speak to owner tonight. Has Madejski chosen another bad bunch? #readingfc
722546331328331777 2016-04-19 22:04:04 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts @willow1871 @BBCBerkshire that's news fans deserve to hear in its own right so make headline story of his refusal #readingfc
722545847276302336 2016-04-19 22:02:08 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @joedavey1996 that's what McDermott is doing! Too busy to talk about it at the moment FFS. What planning! & what will Thais do? #readingfc
722545159045541892 2016-04-19 21:59:24 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @NeilWillby @charles_watts Charles & other local media should be asking the owners that. Supporters deserve more than a crap song #readingfc
722544326589329408 2016-04-19 21:56:06 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts @willow1871 @BBCBerkshire one of the Thai owners was in town & no one from local media collared him?! Missed opp #readingfc
722543342366666753 2016-04-19 21:52:11 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts suspect tonight's attendance was even lower than declared! #readingfc
722542777179992065 2016-04-19 21:49:56 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> We were set up with no width so how come we still managed to leave an 8 lane motorway straight thru the centre of our defence?! #readingfc
722542315299020800 2016-04-19 21:48:06 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Rotherham aren't Warnock's team either but unlike McDermott he's got significant improvements out of the squad inherited #readingfc
722527431085703169 2016-04-19 20:48:58 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @Fozziebear17 @davemc_exile @LordCKS @ReadingFC nonsense some are his players and a good manager/coach can improve what they got #readingfc
722526215723200513 2016-04-19 20:44:08 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> The Hull fans sing: ' 1-0 and you f*cked it up' as though that was unusual! 'Same old story' more appropriate! #readingfc
722523171807707136 2016-04-19 20:32:02 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Was that first ball boy related to McDermott? Didn't seem to have a clue what he was doing. Completely lost! #readingfc
722522215678361600 2016-04-19 20:28:14 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts no defence. Massive difference between the two signals. Penalty is flag across chest IIRC. Appalling cock up! #readingfc
722521575455662080 2016-04-19 20:25:42 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @adsavory only one thing - signal for corner and that for a penalty are completely different! Appalling 'officiating' #readingfc
722520752692543488 2016-04-19 20:22:25 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> And the PL think they have crap officials?! We've got two clowns performing here at The Mad Stad! #readingfc
722516698692071424 2016-04-19 20:06:19 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @jonnafon @ReadingFC Because it was meant to be a documentary not a slap stick comedy or tragic farce?! #readingfc
722513379450044418 2016-04-19 19:53:07 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @simply_langers going forwards but defending remains an absolute liability. Would be 2-3 goals down if Hull had shooting boots on #readingfc
722505003269758976 2016-04-19 19:19:50 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Normal service resumed. Long ball from keeper down middle, missed by Cooper, slotted home 1-1 Who the hell coaches our defence?! #readingfc
722501449918332930 2016-04-19 19:05:43 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Looks like Hull didn't bother to watch the Leeds' game highlights! Carbon copy free kick from Norwood! 1-0 #readingfc
722500828414767104 2016-04-19 19:03:15 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Perhaps we would do better if McDermott stopped being a 'steward' & started managing! #DJMegaparty #readingfc
722498891732660226 2016-04-19 18:55:33 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> BM will be able to spot individuals if they walk out early tonight! Suspect would be even worse if fans hadn't got season tickets #readingfc
722497749845979138 2016-04-19 18:51:01 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> One thing's for sure. Tonight's declared attendance will be even less reliable than a politician's tax & expenses return! #readingfc
722496944095014912 2016-04-19 18:47:49 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Wow! Have I turned up to a reserve game?! Fans appear to have expressed their feelings thru their absence tonight. #empty seats #readingfc
722143388481490944 2016-04-18 19:22:55 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> My head says not to waste more time & money going to tomorrow's game. My heart tells me to go, in the hope team finally perform #readingfc
721779128362496001 2016-04-17 19:15:28 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> No wonder the club under achieves when its supporters put up with crap & excuse it with 'it could be worse'. Aim low end up lower #readingfc
721412645505658881 2016-04-16 18:59:12 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @JR_1871 unless things pick up a bit before the end of the season I reckon he might be enjoying a summer gardening! Looking forward to it.
721395965731737600 2016-04-16 17:52:55 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Sadly would probably get the same results on UK motorways. Need more police & tougher penalties.https://twitter.com/Adweek/status/721363785672314880
721388182936363009 2016-04-16 17:22:00 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> It's absolute nonsense to claim our squad isn't good enough, as most of the players will prove at their new clubs next season! #readingfc
721387761454997504 2016-04-16 17:20:19 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @charles_watts It's time for you media guys 2 track down our missing & completely silent owners & start asking the big questions! #readingfc
721382575877566464 2016-04-16 16:59:43 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @royalcrisp Another firing would b shambolic. But then everything about club is already pretty shambolic. Rip up and start again! #readingfc
721382021042450432 2016-04-16 16:57:31 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @BBCBerkshire @willow1871 Yes, the owners are missing & silent. Time U tracked them down & asked them questions #decentjournalism #readingfc
721379927661113346 2016-04-16 16:49:12 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @royalcrisp They are not much better now & could be worse by end of season. It's because we remember that we don't want to repeat #readingfc
721379668155359232 2016-04-16 16:48:10 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @royalcrisp You can't really argue an improvement if mistakes are still costing us points. #readingfc
721378939730595840 2016-04-16 16:45:16 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> No idea Howe, Hapless Hammond and McDermott haven't even bothered to sign some decent, proven, experienced & qualified coaches! #readingfc
721378419225837568 2016-04-16 16:43:12 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @royalcrisp If McDermott has all those qualities, Y isn't he using them and getting better performances? Don't need to know club #readingfc
721378126689878017 2016-04-16 16:42:02 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @royalcrisp No problem - we are safe (yippee!) He can go & we have time to find a decent replacement. No magic needed! #readingfc
721377782077530112 2016-04-16 16:40:40 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Someone has just said Evans doesn't start because he can't last more than 60 mins?!  If so,why did we sign a youngster like that? #readingfc
721377413582745602 2016-04-16 16:39:12 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @imnotasian1994 If we finish below 17th?  I reckon they can start preparing the P45 now then! #readingfc
721376874002313216 2016-04-16 16:37:03 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @BBCBerkshire @willow1871 Tuesday might be the first time I've deliberately stayed away from a #readingfc game since the days of Bullivant
721375298042859520 2016-04-16 16:30:48 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @simply_langers Warnock would've knocked the thought of relegation and a determination to win into their minds! #nomoreMrNiceGuy #readingfc
721374863668195328 2016-04-16 16:29:04 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Yet someone else coming out with the b*llocks that 'it's not his team'! Many were known to him, signed others & should improve #readingfc
721374568833794048 2016-04-16 16:27:54 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> No wonder the club does so poorly when fans are celebrating safety from relegation with this squad. #zeroambition #losers #readingfc
721374133527965696 2016-04-16 16:26:10 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @simply_langers Guarantee that the likes of Warnock would b able 2 get something out of this squad.  Good chance BM won't improve #readingfc
721373650377646080 2016-04-16 16:24:15 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> The idea that any players really caredeeply about clubs! But true competitors always compete & real winners always want to win #readingfc
721373155982491649 2016-04-16 16:22:17 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> The real attendance, not what the club declare, on Tuesday will tell the absent Thais, Madejski, Howe & Hammond what fans think #readingfc

721369251513282561 2016-04-16 16:06:46 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> I don't want to dislike McDermott 'cos of PL promotion last time. But the longer he flounders along this time harder it becomes #readingfc

721058684105789441 2016-04-15 19:32:41 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton easier said than done as HMRC staff jump ship to earn more money by finding holes & devising tax avoidance schemes.  1 step ahead
721058249835995137 2016-04-15 19:30:58 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton IMO aggressive tax avoidance is using tax advisors,often ex HMRC,to identify & exploit loopholes in tax regulations #taxavoidance
720233933439385600 2016-04-13 12:55:25 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> How convenient that after all this time the #Whittingdale escort story breaks! Takes the spotlight off #DodgyDave and his #tax
720139187597533184 2016-04-12 06:38:56 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> I dislike Warnock the man but have absolutely no doubt Warnock the manager would've got far more out of our squad than McDermott #readingfc
719996826376617985 2016-04-12 21:13:14 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton @jdpoppy Give McDermott more time and next season will be another disaster. He is not the right man for the job.
719996466358575105 2016-04-12 21:11:49 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton @jdpoppy Not that old chestnut. Good managers can & should be able to work with what they get e.g. Warnock & lots are BM players
719995961469218817 2016-04-12 21:09:48 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton @jdpoppy I admit it but it doesn't make my viewpoint wrong! Just what has Mr Nice Guy achieved this time? Sod all. Defend that?
719995429144932353 2016-04-12 21:07:41 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> So McDermott was going to bring us team spirit & togetherness?! 2 more epic fails! #thewrongman #timeforchange #nomoreMrNiceGuy #readingfc

719989045682663424 2016-04-12 20:42:19 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton How come Dim Tellor never manages to describe/go off on one about Kermorgant's numerous misses? He's a flop too. #readingfc
719988699077980161 2016-04-12 20:40:57 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton Oh come on! Dim Tellor's descriptions of what he's seen are about as accurate & reliable as a politicians tax return #witchhunt

719103777698103296 2016-04-10 10:04:35 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton   Ir was aimed at McDermott's comments not U! Quality has been poor, scraped some draws & only beaten low teams. Not good at home
719094987590340608 2016-04-10 09:29:39 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton you're kidding? Did he really? What a thick moron or cynical bare-faced liar!
719094197886783488 2016-04-10 09:26:31 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Yes Brian, we've had a good 2016 at home drawing & sometimes grinding out wins v teams lower than 15th #reality check #readingfc
719092573143449600 2016-04-10 09:20:04 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MartinSLewis he's managing to avoid that much through just using legitimate allowances?! Nice to be able to afford expert tax planners.
719091658499964928 2016-04-10 09:16:26 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MartinSLewis it is hypocritical if you tell everyone it's wrong to avoid tax. Surely the point of tax planning is to avoid tax?!
719091067392548865 2016-04-10 09:14:05 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton I believe she denied having offshore unit trusts
719085723224305665 2016-04-10 08:52:51 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton I think he asked about offshore trusts
719085471335321600 2016-04-10 08:51:50 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> For God's sake stop trying to defend @David_Cameron! He is a hypocritical tax avoiding individual beneath contempt-Period! #panamapapers
718866177888501760 2016-04-09 18:20:27 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @darrenjseward @willow1871 if they did then IMO they were wrong too. Keep it local. Horse racing fans don't know how to retune?
718865676803391492 2016-04-09 18:18:27 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> According to @willow1871 #readingfc haven't beaten a team higher than 16th in the table since McDermott took over. #unacceptable #readingfc
718864912743849985 2016-04-09 18:15:25 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @willow1871 its a local sports show. IMO you should use your local content not take up airtime with BBC national radio material.
718864108976795648 2016-04-09 18:12:14 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @willow1871 agree its not.By all means cover Many Clouds but just use own reports don't rebroadcast BBC national feed.
718862912123760640 2016-04-09 18:07:28 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @darrenjseward @willow1871 didn't say it was all about #readingfc but pointless & wrong just broadcasting national station commentary
718862242335342592 2016-04-09 18:04:49 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @David_Cameron Don't blame it on the sunshine,don't blame it on the moonlight, don't  blame it on the good times,blame it on the greedy #tax
718850678328791040 2016-04-09 17:18:51 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> McDermott should be preparing/working now to ensure strong start next season. He is failing in so many respects. #thewrongman #readingfc
718849591945392128 2016-04-09 17:14:32 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Don't want to dislike McDermott cos of what he gave us last time However  crap performances & results this time r testing resolve #readingfc

718848163617075200 2016-04-09 17:08:52 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> The moment @willow1871 came up with some stats demonstrating McDermott's poor record Dellor suddenly wanted to talk about horses! #readingfc
718843019626180612 2016-04-09 16:48:25 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @BBCBerkshire your coverage 2day as poor as #readingfc performance. UR a local radio. Stick to local sport. People can retune for National
718841094751051778 2016-04-09 16:40:47 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @willow1871 your coverage today is as poor as #readingfc performance. UR a local station, stick to local sport. People can retune 4 National
718824976183390208 2016-04-09 15:36:44 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @ReadingFC that attendance figure is about as believable as @David_Cameron statements on tax! #readingfc
718816972239192066 2016-04-09 15:04:55 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Now that gutless 1st half performance @TimDellor & @willow1871 WAS being disrespectful to Reading fans everywhere #readingfc

718814189666611201 2016-04-09 14:53:52 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Well the first half was a complete waste of time and money. Will it improve 2nd half? #readingfc
718813063433076736 2016-04-09 14:49:23 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> So much for McDermott's philosophy of spirit, passion & team. All completely lacking so far. As for good football...#unacceptable #readingfc
718808730402430976 2016-04-09 14:32:10 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> I don't know about McDermott's football being one dimensional but it's certainly one directional - backwards! #readingfc
718805684851224576 2016-04-09 14:20:04 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Do we even have a specialist coach for our defence? Doesn't look like it but, if we do, he should be fired! #costsaving #readingfc

718798935175929856 2016-04-09 13:53:15 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @Jamesyboy78 @ReadingFC and Kermorgant should stick to using his head! #waywardshooting

718540752175939584 2016-04-08 20:47:19 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Unusually poor performance from #Lionesses lacking pace, creativity and quality for far too much of game #EngvBel
718528977841831940 2016-04-08 20:00:32 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MrBLawton Ireland's number 1 @gracemoloney would have kicked the ball and the striker (accidentally of course) clear! ;-) #ReadingFCWomen

717439135573794816 2016-04-05 19:49:53 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Forest have strikers who make surging runs into the box intending to score. We don't! That's why we're losing. #readingfc
717438668777136130 2016-04-05 19:48:02 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Forest fans sing: 'Is this a library?' No, more like a sodding mortuary! Football is dead at The Madejski. #readingfc

716653207422963713 2016-04-03 15:46:54 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> I suspect many of the Dellor fans constantly pick on our players during the game 2. There is no defending his treatment of Vydra. #readingfc
716652497134292992 2016-04-03 15:44:04 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @hitfour6 How old did you say you were? Experience of life will make you see many things differently. Maybe you don't know it all. Any idea?
716383079942717441 2016-04-02 21:53:30 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> Used to admire Dellor's passion but his obsession with Vydra is worse than mine with Madejski & that's really saying something! #readingfc
716381265264525312 2016-04-02 21:46:18 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MadStadBlues fair point re school fees. Might explain why he's so peed re Vydra earnings. Local radio = state education!
716380334712098816 2016-04-02 21:42:36 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @MadStadBlues I've suggested he blocks me too. Will save my battery! Still odds on he will get Baskerville treatment from club soon re Vydra
716379520773857283 2016-04-02 21:39:22 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TimDellor best block me then. ;-)Throw sarcasm re talent & run?!  2 can play at that. Hospital radio next step up? Cheerio  #readingfc

716372976317411328 2016-04-02 21:13:21 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @wolfiesmith1871 basically what I said. Can hear on highlights + interview with McDermott
716372147971690497 2016-04-02 21:10:04 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @j1mmyheath @TimDellor about as fair as TD treatment of Vydra. Prob spent far more time & money supporting than U (TD gets paid) #readingfc
716349728611569665 2016-04-02 19:40:59 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TimDellor it seemed you almost virtually implied Vydra had deliberately missed/was negligent in order to insult Reading fans #readingfc
716349136296144898 2016-04-02 19:38:37 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TimDellor your claim that Vydra's penalty was an insult to all Reading fans was ludicrous, unprofessional, & bordering slander #readingfc
716348658711703553 2016-04-02 19:36:44 UTC <AndyRFCCharman> @TimDellor you were highly selective with stats as usual so little wonder listeners are selective in who they listen to. #readingfc
