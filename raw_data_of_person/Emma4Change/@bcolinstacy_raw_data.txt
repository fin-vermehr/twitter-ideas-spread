And the system is designed to beat us into submission while we rage. We all start some place. Im still figuring it out myself.
966598987984883712 2018-02-22 09:02:11 UTC <bcolinstacy> @austin_DSA @SadHillWill @meliorism Yeah and if you cant make the meeting they should have plenty of direct action events and organizing going on, which is really what DSA is about. Their FB page should show whats upcoming. Thats a good place to start. Mass organizing is really our strongest means of action rn.

966536037756559360 2018-02-21 04:52:03 UTC <bcolinstacy> @cinephile24 @LanceStLaurent It does crosscut to Frances saying Fuck em and tossing a Molotov into the window behind Sam so theres that. But this moment, its very sincere.

966129623552741376 2018-02-20 01:57:06 UTC <bcolinstacy> @Overstweet @scottderrickson I think its vulgar and strange. Let these children breathe and grieve and lament without saddling them with trivial film references. Joan of Arc is a pretty harrowing tale to just casually place over her life.
966128826039324672 2018-02-20 01:53:56 UTC <bcolinstacy> @Overstweet @scottderrickson Should we pair every suffering teenager in FL right now with their cinematic correlation? What good is that? It erases this young girl and her present trauma.
966127932157685760 2018-02-20 01:50:23 UTC <bcolinstacy> @Overstweet @scottderrickson So yeah okay, what you posted was not Joan of Arcthats Maria Falconetti. And to make a strained film connection to the suffering this child and her community (and nation) are going through is glib and, to me, fetishistic. So... they both have shaved heads, okay.

963166354256867328 2018-02-12 21:42:08 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier right!! that expansion *is* the kingdom now. in expanding we leave old things behind and create something new and more inclusive by nature
963166009355128832 2018-02-12 21:40:46 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier I mean you throw out the stuff about the Bible affirming slavery and about womens function in leadership and interracial marriage, right?
963164646210527233 2018-02-12 21:35:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier Im not trying to goad you: but why?
963163897724329985 2018-02-12 21:32:22 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier if you cant ditch bad interpretation/praxis then what other avenue does an LGBTQ-identifying person have within Christianity?
963162542121127937 2018-02-12 21:26:59 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier ie what does it ultimately mean that the kingdom resides in *our hearts*?
963162379176546306 2018-02-12 21:26:20 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier Id use a different word than difficult to qualify why one should move past certain paradigms. Difficult is perceptive whereas Id identify these as foundational issues.
963156453115813888 2018-02-12 21:02:47 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier Kylo Ren that shit
963156419406172160 2018-02-12 21:02:39 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier So dont toss it out then, expand it. (Which will essentially be a tossing out imo)
963156107593121793 2018-02-12 21:01:25 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier why hold exclusivist views re the LGBTQ community? mostly because people are afraid to see conditioned norms dissolve, to watch what they believed was authority crumble away. if we are to take any responsibility for our world then we must insist on letting some old things whither
963155292568670208 2018-02-12 20:58:10 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier the Kingdom is, for all intents and purposes, in the hands of humanity. religion must press past itself, otherwise we remain creatures in stasis. and that stasis inherently favors those who find privilege in hegemony.
963154719014293505 2018-02-12 20:55:54 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier the question for me is why uphold certain patriarchal norms and not others? what offense is it to God or his creation that we develop and let blossom a more robustly inclusive sexual and gender paradigm? our vision of the future must be progressively inclusive.
963153265121673218 2018-02-12 20:50:07 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier we should be building a new hermeneutic to contextualize LGBTQ lives within Scriptutal study. the past is woefully ill-equipped to handle these concerns. at least past interpretation and translation (especially within modernity)
963152557601247232 2018-02-12 20:47:18 UTC <bcolinstacy> @blakeicollier @AltamiraBlog re that new NT translation?

962137590358044673 2018-02-09 01:34:11 UTC <bcolinstacy> @brettmccracken @DavidRoark Also, this TGC guy really shouldnt be writing about something he clearly doesnt understand. Its a shallow hit piece on secularism underscored with bad scientific conclusions.
962136257068445697 2018-02-09 01:28:53 UTC <bcolinstacy> @brettmccracken @DavidRoark It really only seems good for sustaining a legacy of hostility, fear, and exclusion toward a mass of people who have already faced enough persecution, especially from Christians.
962135720826753030 2018-02-09 01:26:46 UTC <bcolinstacy> @brettmccracken @DavidRoark Yeah. So I find this type of prescriptive authoritarian posturing really troublesome. What good is this article/position if one doesnt actively engage with the transgender community? (Keep in mind, I dont think identifying LGBTQ in any way is a sin.)

952019608910770176 2018-01-12 03:28:57 UTC <bcolinstacy> Whisper of the Heart (dubbed) was the choice for family movie night. What a lovely little film. Like The Green Ray but middle school.

951934590146531330 2018-01-12 21:51:07 UTC <bcolinstacy> This is one of the Great Works.
951934506658910208 2018-01-12 21:50:47 UTC <bcolinstacy> Its blues in the major key and there arent many of its kindfully Southern and black. As Burnett (and Harrys) strange yarn ends, Gideon delivers the punchline: "White people, any people, it don't matter. It's just a story." But we know that aint true.
951934051581128704 2018-01-12 21:48:58 UTC <bcolinstacy> To Sleep With Anger: the quintessential Southern filmthe Great Migration historicized into family dynamic, a transposed folklore. Charles Burnett casts South Central as Mississippi, etc.palms for pines and yet the devil is always at the door.

951847503502114816 2018-01-12 16:05:03 UTC <bcolinstacy> @whitecitycinema Was literally about to say this in my next tweet! That Burnett ostensibly tells a history of the Great Migration as a folkloric yarn is essentially Southern. How he casts setting (I read South Central as Natchez, MS) is unparalleled!
951844839733256193 2018-01-12 15:54:28 UTC <bcolinstacy> To Sleep With Anger is the perfect Southern film

946967707567775745 2017-12-29 04:54:29 UTC <bcolinstacy> @trappedinazorb @NeilBahadur @rarerborealis My initial reaction is that the architect(s) of the AI is of a patriarchal/normative culture so these models are built as such. How they evolve beyond that would have to be in the hands of replicant architects....right?
946967173842505730 2017-12-29 04:52:22 UTC <bcolinstacy> @trappedinazorb @NeilBahadur @rarerborealis Sorry was being facetious about Leto, but really is this not all by intention of design? Joi is a program developed by Wallace; and Rachel is an older model so if the newer gen is gendered she definitely wouldve been. I get what youre saying and want to think about it more

946922657047629824 2017-12-29 01:55:29 UTC <bcolinstacy> @swen_ryan Both share an almost religious sense of isolation in inverted/gnarled natural spaces; lone stoic figures of duty interrupted by ominous existential quests of undetermined origin; hallucinatory, both ancient and futuristic, in his past narrative/myth bears upon the present reality

946755983807627264 2017-12-29 14:53:11 UTC <bcolinstacy> @AltamiraBlog I kinda loved that about it. Felt like Grand Theft Auto meets Blade Runner. Was glad to explore the world with no narrative necessity so as to find myself disoriented by these micro-cells of desolation.
946755182536167424 2017-12-29 14:50:00 UTC <bcolinstacy> one of the best things about BR2049 is it keeps Ford out of the film until absolutely necessary
946751899813871616 2017-12-29 14:36:57 UTC <bcolinstacy> @AltamiraBlog A particularly overwrought boredom which makes it all the worse. I think BR2049 cuts through a lot of that and yields something more contemplative. Just glad hes not doing his morality tale schtick.

When you pray, think well what you are saying, and make your thoughts into things that are solid. In that manner, your prayer will have strength, and that strength shall become part of you, mind, body, and spirit.

942882330015883269 2017-12-18 22:20:40 UTC <bcolinstacy> @bronco7732 I think BACKBONE is incredibly weak. A lot of thematic posturing that pulls up before ever committing to its conceit. Macabre has to run bone-deep yet hes a bit too obsessed with the pus on the skin (lol what)
942881747351547904 2017-12-18 22:18:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> @bronco7732 Truly unfortunate. Its strange how moving some find it and how dead it is to others. Hes notably a filmmaker/storyteller of surfaces who I think thrives in simplicitywhy CRIMSON PEAK and KRONOS are maybe his best; I have always loved PL but havent revisited it in some time.

CGI that rivals practical effects (which is kinda the point lol). Its well worth the 106 minutes and is better than much of what Ive seen this year.

938841218393485313 2017-12-07 18:42:43 UTC <bcolinstacy> @JeremyMDoan When the telos is personal salvation and not that of the entire cosmos, then politics doesnt matter to those who benefit (or are told they benefit) from the decisions of legislators to pillage society. We lost a lot of social awareness when the Bible was translated into English.

938822996759891973 2017-12-07 17:30:19 UTC <bcolinstacy> @ceylonsailor its all snake oil
938821275845263360 2017-12-07 17:23:29 UTC <bcolinstacy> It takes a colossal golden shovel to dig out of that level of shit.
938821077433835520 2017-12-07 17:22:41 UTC <bcolinstacy> Western/evangelical Christianity is pure colonialism, which is why we were taught that Marx/socialists/communists/etc were the worlds greatest evil. I was made to believe I was wiser/smarter than non-believers, that my only goal was to convert them (even if by love).
938820472199897088 2017-12-07 17:20:17 UTC <bcolinstacy> Ignoring the political reality of the Kingdom of God being instituted by Jesus (which finds best praxis in the socialist form) in favor of vague spiritualism is not only gross Gnosticism but really all about making goyim more comfortable appropriating Jewish religion/culture.
938814403641823234 2017-12-07 16:56:10 UTC <bcolinstacy> *and the poor
938814069368336385 2017-12-07 16:54:51 UTC <bcolinstacy> They literally do not see the care and redemption of the oppressed in the poor as the major arc of history, even when its right there in the text.
938813874467409921 2017-12-07 16:54:04 UTC <bcolinstacy> If Christ has no bearing upon politics, they can vote for whomever as long as their actual ulterior interests (puritanical normative culture and institutional power) are insulated.
938813761481211904 2017-12-07 16:53:37 UTC <bcolinstacy> Theyve misinterpreted the very person and work of Christ by divorcing his explicitly political function from the spiritual.
938813086382903296 2017-12-07 16:50:56 UTC <bcolinstacy> Growing up evangelical it was pounded into us that Jesuss work wasnt that of a political messiahas the Jews and any scholar of the Law and the Prophets would assumebut the work of a purely spiritual salvation. Thats why many American Christians hate big government:

938141605407657984 2017-12-05 20:22:43 UTC <bcolinstacy> @dakern @alissamarie What got me into cinema wasnt the canon but thoughtful critics that made me see the world anew through film. (Alissa is one of those critics.)
938140809572077569 2017-12-05 20:19:33 UTC <bcolinstacy> @dakern @alissamarie *The* film canon is soon to explode along with the industrys political and social structures so I say take the chance to shape outside the norm. Community is better than canon. And if youve no rep cinema, find some old programming from theaters and do them at home.
938140311418818561 2017-12-05 20:17:34 UTC <bcolinstacy> @dakern @alissamarie Honestly Id say take these people to whatever local rep theater is near you. Go to a few films each week and discuss them. Embed them in a community that takes film/art seriously. And have them read about film as much (if not more) than they watch.

936008460323446784 2017-11-29 23:06:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> @parietines Oh and part of the $ funded a trip to LA to sell them at the New Bev during their Elaine May screenings this past May. If I can get a bigger production going Id like to start a grant for female filmmakers (especially WOC). Thats the dream.
936005217505759233 2017-11-29 22:53:28 UTC <bcolinstacy> @parietines so far through the webstore Ive recouped production costs & had a small profit. I havent sold many the second go around. But Ill split these profits: a portion for myself and taxes and a portion to another shirt design hopefully and a gift to charity, awareness fund, etc.
936004429215666176 2017-11-29 22:50:20 UTC <bcolinstacy> @parietines the initial run was done through Kickstarter which fully funded the cost of production (shirts, design/logos, extra items, shipping) and I was able to make a donation to clo journal. the rest was put toward this second run.

But yeah I agree, still think its primary mode as A Stilted Affair is ineffective. Wouldve liked some Converse or a New Wave song thrown in for old times sake.

934969713586769920 2017-11-26 02:18:45 UTC <bcolinstacy> @DieRobinsonDie @malteserubble The narrative forces you to reckon with these people (how sweet, white supremacists have feelings and daughters and dreams too) yet its so repellent you hate them all the more. The only thing cutting through the extreme nastiness is the humorwhich is also nasty.
934969355863027712 2017-11-26 02:17:19 UTC <bcolinstacy> @DieRobinsonDie @malteserubble I read the redemption as a tactic to reestablish The Way Things Are, a la THE HATEFUL EIGHT, that subtly plays with complicity and all that. Though its definitely a have our cake and eat it too kind of endeavor.

934632530678046720 2017-11-25 03:58:54 UTC <bcolinstacy> @atalvareo I did when I first saw it. That was before I really knew anything. I think its as vanilla as they come. Though I do like the pair of Menzel and Bell
934632207875964928 2017-11-25 03:57:37 UTC <bcolinstacy> @atalvareo its unfortunate but that COCO is so so good will outlast this
934631875083108352 2017-11-25 03:56:18 UTC <bcolinstacy> @atalvareo not to mention the whiplash of watching the very um white world of FROZEN before something as culturally rich as COCO. its a power dynamic unto itself.
934630784878698497 2017-11-25 03:51:58 UTC <bcolinstacy> @atalvareo for showing up to see COCO.
934630581350039552 2017-11-25 03:51:09 UTC <bcolinstacy> @atalvareo toward an inevitable money grab. I mean if people go just for the short and wind up seeing COCO theyre better for it, but that the industrial framework is laid out as such plays as cynical. not to mention after the short is a video of Pixars filmmakers thanking the audience
934629850954035201 2017-11-25 03:48:15 UTC <bcolinstacy> @atalvareo ultimately its cynical in its juxtaposition with COCO, a film whose cultural worth is as much about its value as an art object as it is a progression of representational value in the industry. that a vapid Olaf short would precede such a genuine work of art is gross posturing
934629151360856065 2017-11-25 03:45:28 UTC <bcolinstacy> @atalvareo theres no reason a FROZEN short should be 20+ minutes. imo its a garbage, money-grabbing property with hardly an ounce of artistic value, esp re: Olaf who is one of the most annoying monstrosities in Disney history. and the short is about him and his value to this world blech
934626433128902657 2017-11-25 03:34:40 UTC <bcolinstacy> heres a strong opinion: having the 21-minute Olaf/FROZEN short precede COCO is cynical and tasteless
934625740917760000 2017-11-25 03:31:55 UTC <bcolinstacy> @CineTalksSam its a v bad thing. honestly kinda appalled that short precedes such a marvelous film like COCO

933194885406093312 2017-11-21 04:46:13 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley Uh-huh. Its what HATEFUL EIGHT wanted to be (and I like the film quite a bit). VP gives me major Tourneur vibes, a la I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE.
933192868969287680 2017-11-21 04:38:12 UTC <bcolinstacy> Its so frightening. Nothing quite like his work.

933173431201173504 2017-11-21 03:20:58 UTC <bcolinstacy> @paranoidliotta I need to read Glenn on it. And watch the film again. I found a context for all the vileness, esp. if Connie is viewed as an animal/monster of social conditioning, etc. I liked it as a microcosmic pinball machine that is this garbage country.

930519043181895680 2017-11-14 19:33:22 UTC <bcolinstacy> @austinfilm Hi, so I created some Elaine May shirts earlier this year and wonder if AFS could host a merch booth at this screening next week. I visited the New Bev in May where I sold them before their A NEW LEAF-ISHTAR double bills and it was quite a success.

930172644913303552 2017-11-13 20:36:54 UTC <bcolinstacy> @d_l_mayfield @JeremyMDoan Things like this always feel like a PR move for police depts instead of actual support for families. It misses a broader vision of prison reform/dismantlement. This, esp in TX where immigrant families are targeted by ICE via local law enforcement, is precarious.
930170747917565955 2017-11-13 20:29:22 UTC <bcolinstacy> @JeremyMDoan @d_l_mayfield Yeah, this feels really strange tbh. The carceral state is the issue, and having law enforcement serve seems glib and almost indulgent.

928822422714900480 2017-11-09 03:11:36 UTC <bcolinstacy> I remain a Christian for many reasonswhich I wont belabor here at the momentbut one is to dismantle the Old Order (which is, frankly, all our work to do) because it is wholly antithetical to the call and kingdom of Christ.
928818515020255232 2017-11-09 02:56:05 UTC <bcolinstacy> Jesus, in public, healed an outcast woman who suffered from chronic menstrual issues. So dont tell me he doesnt care about womens issues or feminism or what-have-you.
928817792018771968 2017-11-09 02:53:12 UTC <bcolinstacy> 2: Antiqiated notions of gender roles were crushed along with the curse of sin through Jesuss death, resurrection and ascension. He literally instituted a new reality, yet evangelicalism (old white men) seeks to maintain the Old Order.
928817314874740736 2017-11-09 02:51:19 UTC <bcolinstacy> 2: Most evangelical men are scared of interactions with women because they have no robust vision of sexuality. They suppress, suppress, suppress, and are thus pent up with sexual fury. Its honestly frightening. And this, this is why women cant be pastors or preachers.
928816852750553089 2017-11-09 02:49:28 UTC <bcolinstacy> 2: I know too many Christians outraged about what is going on in Hollywood yet the same system is the framework of most evangelicalism. It stems (1) from an arrested theology of sex and the body and (2) the ancient patriarchal architecture.
928816100434948101 2017-11-09 02:46:29 UTC <bcolinstacy> 2 (cont): The explicit denial of women in leadership, while they labor tirelessly behind the scenes, is to turn an eye to a complicity in systemic abuse and trauma. These lessons are actually in the Bible yet are never preached, these lessons never gleaned.
928815425294610433 2017-11-09 02:43:48 UTC <bcolinstacy> wrt 2: Evangelicalism has done everything it can to keep up the patriarchy (e.g. complementarianism) through an appeal to Gods created orderAdam as head, Eve as helpmate. This is the ultimate in Good Guy Ally-ism via an appeal to more grace and seeking peace.
928814607547944960 2017-11-09 02:40:33 UTC <bcolinstacy> wrt 1: Louis C.K. making I LOVE YOU, DADDY is basically how old, white, evangelical conservative men interpret scripture: self-righteous introspection regarding sin/transgression/etc. yet too proud/hypocritical to seek help. For them, the vocation is essentially the exorcism.
928813349806239744 2017-11-09 02:35:33 UTC <bcolinstacy> A couple of things to glean from today, for Christians: 1. Those who typically base their politics on biblical values have learned nothing from the Bible. 2. Its imperative that women are given positions of leadership in churches (esp. evangelical), i.e. pastor, preacher, etc.

918926819260186624 2017-10-13 19:50:01 UTC <bcolinstacy> MASSEDUCTION is like St. Vincent did a collection of jock jams and I love it
918867436207665152 2017-10-13 15:54:03 UTC <bcolinstacy> @danyomolloy shut up
918867339465990146 2017-10-13 15:53:40 UTC <bcolinstacy> Wonder what would happen if you played the climax of THE FLY and Justin Timberlake's "Mirrors" simultaneously
918866949450244097 2017-10-13 15:52:07 UTC <bcolinstacy> @aherman2006 Exactly. And that nightmare hews so very close to the actual experience of childbirth!
918865448422203392 2017-10-13 15:46:09 UTC <bcolinstacy> @aherman2006 Undoubtedly. It's a slaughterhouse of assault against women. And that Stathis ends up, other than some sick flesh wounds, unscathed is bleak
918853614491246592 2017-10-13 14:59:07 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley Merry Christmas!!

918829507078795264 2017-10-13 13:23:20 UTC <bcolinstacy> One of the film's bleakest truths: Stathis, the worst of men, remains

918826567681183745 2017-10-13 13:11:39 UTC <bcolinstacy> There's just so *much* in this film. One of those rare complete texts.

918536502686121989 2017-10-12 17:59:02 UTC <bcolinstacy> @JoelGord Christians are particularly bad at amplifying the "emapathy machinery" as cinema's apotheosis.
918536308108251139 2017-10-12 17:58:16 UTC <bcolinstacy> @JoelGord Gotcha. And honestly I think what we perceive as "empathy" in art is only possibility. Has to be embedded in intersection to be actualized.

918489290832859136 2017-10-12 14:51:26 UTC <bcolinstacy> @willow_catelyn Exactly. It's that it's become a wholesale hermeneutic that bothers me.

916750569217327105 2017-10-07 19:42:22 UTC <bcolinstacy> @DavidRoark Oof. Yeah, PRISONERS and SICARIO are criminal imo. I like ENEMY though.
916750127959814144 2017-10-07 19:40:37 UTC <bcolinstacy> @DavidRoark Does this hinge mostly on your love for ARRIVAL? (one which I haven't seen yet btw)

916748570572845062 2017-10-07 19:34:26 UTC <bcolinstacy> @DavidRoark Such a blade runner thing to say to a replicant like me.
916748295028072449 2017-10-07 19:33:20 UTC <bcolinstacy> I've taught Ev to tell Walt that "the library is an important institution" any time the little one pulls books from our shelves.
916740930769702912 2017-10-07 19:04:04 UTC <bcolinstacy> @DavidRoark No. I'm not a fan of the original and there's no modern filmmaker I dislike more than Villeneuve.
916740550660849665 2017-10-07 19:02:34 UTC <bcolinstacy> @VinnyTucceri That's what I was thinking.

916482220809998341 2017-10-06 01:56:03 UTC <bcolinstacy> Anyway, later this evening, hours after the story, he asks from his car seat if I'll play some "blue."   I got parenting figured out.
916481758891270144 2017-10-06 01:54:13 UTC <bcolinstacy> There they became a famous blues duowhich I described while Paul "Wine" Jones played over the car speakersand eventually returned home.
916481255373459456 2017-10-06 01:52:13 UTC <bcolinstacy> He and Shelley Winters hopped trains and were eventually smuggled onto a cargo ship bound for Great Britain.
916480747539783681 2017-10-06 01:50:12 UTC <bcolinstacy> Ev likes me to make up stories for him throughout the day, mostly on car rides and at night. Today I made up some Robert Zimmerman fanfic.

915915516384092161 2017-10-05 12:24:10 UTC <bcolinstacy> @Glenn__Kenny @NotDBordwell In the context of the film and of its posture toward Am. history proper, there is a connection to dignity and lack of subtitles.

915701488105771014 2017-10-04 22:13:42 UTC <bcolinstacy> @paranoidliotta @bad_garrett It's strongly coded, esp so because he doesn't react as such to the Pontificator nor the settlers.

915690269642825733 2017-10-04 21:29:07 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow @Glenn__Kenny @punicgoddess @jaimegrijalba This is an entirely different conversation if we're talking a foreign language/multicultural film made by a non-Anglo filmmaker.
915689961839632386 2017-10-04 21:27:54 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow @Glenn__Kenny @punicgoddess @jaimegrijalba I bring up the subtitles as a comment/critique of the version of American history/Americana Lowery wants to tell.
915689759061749760 2017-10-04 21:27:05 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow @Glenn__Kenny @punicgoddess @jaimegrijalba I'll be interested in what you think of it in context of this film though. The sequence in question doesn't foreground the Latino family.
915688740047278081 2017-10-04 21:23:02 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow @Glenn__Kenny @punicgoddess @jaimegrijalba My original point has already disappeared into the the firmament. I wasn't talking about the ethics of subtitling in general, just in AGS.
915688303206309888 2017-10-04 21:21:18 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow @Glenn__Kenny @RussTop3Ever Rarely do I have a Take this Hot so if I get clowned so be it!
915686592647454721 2017-10-04 21:14:30 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow @Glenn__Kenny @RussTop3Ever I'm not saying he is. The man just likes his Americana a very traditional way.
915685885055823872 2017-10-04 21:11:42 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow @Glenn__Kenny There's a Brad Paisley song around here somewhere
915685559879729153 2017-10-04 21:10:24 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow @Glenn__Kenny @punicgoddess This is good. I'm unconvinced that Lowery is the multiculturalist that Godard is so...

915681441798909953 2017-10-04 20:54:02 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow Look, I don't think Lowery's a racist; I think the high concept betrayed him.
915681037241470977 2017-10-04 20:52:26 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow *apologia
915680543014088706 2017-10-04 20:50:28 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow Well if the rest of the film weren't a cosmic apology for White history then I would probably read that scene differently.
915679716501311490 2017-10-04 20:47:11 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow This is also amplified by the subtitles Lowery affords the neighboring ghosts in conversation.
915679372509577216 2017-10-04 20:45:49 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow Yeah, it made me consider how far he's going to tokenize that family and other (v.) the ghost.
915676022430994432 2017-10-04 20:32:30 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow Wrote about that here:https://vaguevisages.com/2017/07/08/review-david-lowerys-ghost-story/

915675518762192896 2017-10-04 20:30:30 UTC <bcolinstacy> @railoftomorrow That's not really what I'm getting at. I don't carry that expectation. Lowery's choice to not subtitle is in tune with the unfortunate scope

908007135858057216 2017-09-13 16:39:05 UTC <bcolinstacy> @jake_pitre I haven't yet! Dying to. My most anticipated of the year, maybe century.
908006316567752704 2017-09-13 16:35:50 UTC <bcolinstacy> http://1morefilmblog.com/2016/01/08/in-jackson-heights-wiseman-2015/
908006145318686723 2017-09-13 16:35:09 UTC <bcolinstacy> As a countertext, IN JACKSON HEIGHTS is a mosaic of American experience. Utopia dancing through our heads as the bourgeoisie stomp our feet.
908005243266486272 2017-09-13 16:31:34 UTC <bcolinstacy> Wiseman is practically seething throughout.
908005015977066496 2017-09-13 16:30:40 UTC <bcolinstacy> STATE LEGISLATURE really cracked Wiseman wide open for me.https://thefilmstage.com/features/state-legislature-frederick-wisemans-tome-on-democracy-in-modernity/
908003487543431173 2017-09-13 16:24:35 UTC <bcolinstacy> Essentially, he's reorienting us around a better vision of solidarity and goodness, utilizing the shadows of our shaped world as a lens.
908002921941536769 2017-09-13 16:22:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> He's a dialectic. His aim, justice. By contrasting embedded lives within the institutions they inhabit, he critiques and reshapes society.
908002303201902592 2017-09-13 16:19:53 UTC <bcolinstacy> His study of place/milieu holds in one hand a vision of flourishment and in the other the structures as they stand.
908002097257439232 2017-09-13 16:19:04 UTC <bcolinstacy> Wiseman isn't about institutions; he's about social fabricthe architectures of desire, i.e. utopias, that bolster or topple our Babels.
908001136606670848 2017-09-13 16:15:15 UTC <bcolinstacy> He's an extinct breed: an artist who actualizesby his investigationa vision of a Good world set right.
908000518991163392 2017-09-13 16:12:48 UTC <bcolinstacy> The two films I've seen of his I've also written about. His work has yielded some of my favorite writing experiences.
907999999228874752 2017-09-13 16:10:44 UTC <bcolinstacy> Wiseman on the tl always brings me hope

906354801239306245 2017-09-08 03:13:18 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley (fwiw my "SO MUCH" comment was about the characters more than plot. Love how still so much is unknown/unfulfilled with them.)
906354554907844608 2017-09-08 03:12:19 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley You did, and I appreciate that. It's nice to be left to float in that space every now and then.
906352701042315265 2017-09-08 03:04:57 UTC <bcolinstacy> @bnowalk Fight the good fight, comrade.

906349786487562240 2017-09-08 02:53:22 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley "In" as in "angle into." Sry that's confusing

905999880929386500 2017-09-07 03:42:58 UTC <bcolinstacy> @faceyouhate @railoftomorrow @harryeskin Need to think on this more. It's a fascinating question.
905999426329731072 2017-09-07 03:41:10 UTC <bcolinstacy> @faceyouhate @railoftomorrow @harryeskin Laura's scream reverberates through them all, so yeah that makes sense to me. Though I'd question if any of them are our surrogate(s)

905993918021603329 2017-09-07 03:19:17 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso @FCardamenis @EtanHeytan Right right

905989919247659010 2017-09-07 03:03:23 UTC <bcolinstacy> @faceyouhate @railoftomorrow The "my son" (as confirmation) slipped by me too.

905983021978963971 2017-09-07 02:35:59 UTC <bcolinstacy> @faceyouhate Same. Idk why I try to deep dive with others. I drown quickly.
905982367507947520 2017-09-07 02:33:23 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso @FCardamenis @EtanHeytan he replaced Dougie.
905982268556140544 2017-09-07 02:32:59 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso @FCardamenis @EtanHeytan It's treated as a prologue in the opener but other than that I can't place when/how that would've occurred. Unless it was right before
905981542555635712 2017-09-07 02:30:06 UTC <bcolinstacy> That's what The Fireman tells Coop right?
905981386070384640 2017-09-07 02:29:29 UTC <bcolinstacy> Lemme tell ya TWIN PEAKS is hard to parse when you have a terrible short term memory
905980999967932417 2017-09-07 02:27:57 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso @FCardamenis @EtanHeytan Is it ever made clear when The Fireman actually speaks to Coop?
905980438057017344 2017-09-07 02:25:43 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso @atalvareo @FCardamenis Hmmm like what?
905978165192994816 2017-09-07 02:16:41 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso @harryeskin Gotcha. It's slippery in here Neil
905977878403264512 2017-09-07 02:15:33 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso @FCardamenis @EtanHeytan Most reactions I've seen re: The Fireman's exhortation have been that it was meant as a warning that Coop took as instructions
905977177832902657 2017-09-07 02:12:46 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso @harryeskin Neil's saying Coop's reaction is new post-Carrie/Richard, right? (I thought it was a flashback.)
905976848710021121 2017-09-07 02:11:27 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso What reality/narrative is created/entered with the shift past the electrical poles? What dimension does it exist within?
905976261205471232 2017-09-07 02:09:07 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso Yep I see
905976067919421441 2017-09-07 02:08:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso @FCardamenis Y
905975742529462273 2017-09-07 02:07:03 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso If Richard is a new manifestation of Coop-essentially All Coops-who is it then that Laura now whispers to?
905975493673013248 2017-09-07 02:06:04 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso I'm with you all the way here. (Much of my dispute is about the primary dimension but we can leave that behind.) A query:
905974810060226560 2017-09-07 02:03:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso Elaborate while you're hot
905968457891622916 2017-09-07 01:38:07 UTC <bcolinstacy> What is "bad"?
905968034539606016 2017-09-07 01:36:26 UTC <bcolinstacy> What if...Laura is only the prom photo now
905967681173643264 2017-09-07 01:35:01 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso And too...clean
905967639109005312 2017-09-07 01:34:51 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso Lynch isn't clean obviously. So to nail these delineations is a fool's errand, I just feel the "Coop is bad/rapist/etc" to be inhospitable
905966286185877504 2017-09-07 01:29:29 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso (You're a much smarter man than I so I defer to your wisdom/close read. I haven't rewatched yet.)
905966148268765184 2017-09-07 01:28:56 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso What does one make of the literal BOB blob extracted from Bad Coop?
905966020707405825 2017-09-07 01:28:26 UTC <bcolinstacy> @EricNBarroso A theory specific to Cooper? Or not all those afflicted by BOB?

905098499250900997 2017-09-05 16:01:12 UTC <bcolinstacy> I'll stop there, but Lynch is, to me, an Aquinas or an Augustine or a Paul.
905097997951913985 2017-09-05 15:59:13 UTC <bcolinstacy> of that Original Trauma by it being inflicted upon the divinity as a full and final assault.
905097621517336577 2017-09-05 15:57:43 UTC <bcolinstacy> Humans contain multiverses of Trauma. That's the very center of the work of Christ: a reconstitution of the created order by an expulsion...
905097356143714306 2017-09-05 15:56:40 UTC <bcolinstacy> I don't want to preach, but this is of the stuff I've learned throughout my religious/spiritual journeying.
905096914424782848 2017-09-05 15:54:54 UTC <bcolinstacy> At day's end, all along he's been telling us the same story: trauma transcends time.
905096212533170176 2017-09-05 15:52:07 UTC <bcolinstacy> Lynch's work goes deeper still, as if reorienting synapsehis is epistemological, morphing the senses, placing us in a new time and space.
905095497584705537 2017-09-05 15:49:17 UTC <bcolinstacy> I think a lot about Malick's filmmaking as today's primordial mode, a form of ur-textual mythmaking.
905095050027294720 2017-09-05 15:47:30 UTC <bcolinstacy> I can't avoid hyperbole: THE RETURN is literally transcendentformally, thematically, etc. etc.
905093545853366272 2017-09-05 15:41:31 UTC <bcolinstacy> Lynch created intertexts-within-intertexts with THE RETURN. A work we'll be unraveling for ages.
905093008584044544 2017-09-05 15:39:23 UTC <bcolinstacy> Getting to Richard by way of Bad Coop/Dougie/Dale is some of the best character work we'll ever see.

902708745804943364 2017-08-29 01:45:11 UTC <bcolinstacy> @_JakeMulligan Right before he tells the story he says to Connie that the drugs aren't working, which I read the flashback as hell yes they are
902708567102382080 2017-08-29 01:44:28 UTC <bcolinstacy> @_JakeMulligan My mind was gone apparently cause it took me A WHILE. Like at first I thought Ray's flashback was Nick having some oxy fever dream.
902707552055697408 2017-08-29 01:40:26 UTC <bcolinstacy> @_JakeMulligan Or did that even trick you?
902707481608146944 2017-08-29 01:40:09 UTC <bcolinstacy> No one today (or ever?) does close-ups like him
902707155425513472 2017-08-29 01:38:51 UTC <bcolinstacy> @_JakeMulligan Ok so question: when did you figure out that Ray wasn't Nick in GOOD TIME?
902706311112134656 2017-08-29 01:35:30 UTC <bcolinstacy> @_JakeMulligan That's right. He's so damn good. In everything. Need the Safdie Boys to make a doc on him.
902701934464917504 2017-08-29 01:18:07 UTC <bcolinstacy> @_JakeMulligan Can't wait to read this man. Will do whenever I finally finish my piece lol

902018551703318528 2017-08-27 04:02:36 UTC <bcolinstacy> @a_sleepykisser We all generally agree this is the film/television event of our generation so, ultimately, why steal the joy of discovery from viewers?
902018210937151492 2017-08-27 04:01:14 UTC <bcolinstacy> @a_sleepykisser Emotional textures/rhythms are bastardized; integrity of the film itself compromised. They stick in people's heads and (mis)shape viewing.

902016824996499456 2017-08-27 03:55:44 UTC <bcolinstacy> @a_sleepykisser Full disclosure: I've posted one screencap the day after an episode (Dougie's "Confess" scene). That said, I think we should abstain, esp

902012794995957762 2017-08-27 03:39:43 UTC <bcolinstacy> @joshbrunsting Oh, I agree! Couldn't be that specific in the tweet. More a real time response as I witness people's joy being robbed.

902012043007590400 2017-08-27 03:36:44 UTC <bcolinstacy> @joshbrunsting What purpose does it serve to share these images without bystanders being able to filter/mute them?

902011729772732421 2017-08-27 03:35:29 UTC <bcolinstacy> @joshbrunsting It's a nuisance. Especially when the common response it to tell people they shouldn't be on here at certain times.

894915759587164160 2017-08-08 13:38:38 UTC <bcolinstacy> The Safdies are the only filmmakers who really understand what to do with (and to) Caleb Landry Jones.
894796687922917377 2017-08-07 05:45:29 UTC <bcolinstacy> Hill directs this with such aggressive sensuality. The film's aesthetic is basically an answer to the question: How does Nick Nolte smell?
894796168303177728 2017-08-07 05:43:25 UTC <bcolinstacy> still v concerned about Eddie's front tooth maybe possibly being loose

893917576799150080 2017-08-05 19:32:13 UTC <bcolinstacy> Sally Forrest is fantastic. If you've never seen her, double this with Lupino's NEVER FEAR (aka THE YOUNG LOVERS).
893917120148459521 2017-08-05 19:30:24 UTC <bcolinstacy> Instead of dollars to the wind it's tennis match programs. Infinitely sadder if you ask me.
893916486988947457 2017-08-05 19:27:53 UTC <bcolinstacy> Ida Lupino's HARD, FAST AND BEAUTIFUL is one of the great American films. Iconic final scene akin to THE KILLING or SIERRA MADRE.

887659032319840258 2017-07-19 13:02:59 UTC <bcolinstacy> @chelseadpc @FCardamenis Lowery's timing is very specific throughout, divorced from diegesis. The aural point is well-taken, just wasn't enough for me.

887655276366770176 2017-07-19 12:48:04 UTC <bcolinstacy> @chelseadpc @FCardamenis tells all you need to know about how Lowery feels. (Also I've not read Doestoevsky so the reference is lost on me tbh)
887655005460852737 2017-07-19 12:46:59 UTC <bcolinstacy> @chelseadpc @FCardamenis I can't see how one can refute that he at least buys into some of Sweaty Will's diatribe. The length of the scene alone + ghost's reaction

878050964887920640 2017-06-22 00:43:58 UTC <bcolinstacy> @elazic Boo ! Well I hope you have at least some relief. Bodies are strange things, esp in our youth
877910592224452612 2017-06-22 15:26:10 UTC <bcolinstacy> @flipyourface OMG I weep for you. But that's still some major proximity and yields a good anecdote !

877884594254561280 2017-06-22 13:42:52 UTC <bcolinstacy> @elazic Were you just too committed to the violin when you realized you'd rather play piano ? Back pain is awful. How'd that happen ??

877758949524557825 2017-06-21 05:23:36 UTC <bcolinstacy> @harryeskin I have a deep affection for woodwinds. I don't know too many who play them !
877758721476186112 2017-06-21 05:22:41 UTC <bcolinstacy> @NickAbides Neither can I. That takes a special something in your bones that I lack
877758469335642114 2017-06-21 05:21:41 UTC <bcolinstacy> @malteserubble That's what I'm talking bout
877758385684234241 2017-06-21 05:21:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> @harryeskin And dude, I swear I'm sending your poster soon. Time has been scarce and I need to find the right packaging. Forgive me, friend
877756747749834752 2017-06-21 05:14:51 UTC <bcolinstacy> @FilmsandLetters Thx, was looking to brighten the tl. And you and me both. Hate to watch the stuff, I'm bored instantly. What's your physical activity ?

877755076986654720 2017-06-21 05:08:12 UTC <bcolinstacy> @Hey_Candis Go to bed angry. Sometimes you gotta sleep that shit off.
877754521648287744 2017-06-21 05:06:00 UTC <bcolinstacy> Best I can do is take the better habits residually
877754277325791232 2017-06-21 05:05:02 UTC <bcolinstacy> Good eating habits are most difficult. I can go thru extremes. If not for my wife, who is v disciplined, I'd eat shit.
877753318600314880 2017-06-21 05:01:13 UTC <bcolinstacy> @fauxbeatpoet Love Willie, saw him live in MS years ago. Dude's a showman. Am listening to SM rn and this is good shit, never heard of em

877752757154791424 2017-06-21 04:58:59 UTC <bcolinstacy> @cvalladares0896 I assume it was a success too ???
877752551470268417 2017-06-21 04:58:10 UTC <bcolinstacy> @mcastimovies I agree! Dancing is communal purity. I don't know ballroom but we dance 24/7 at my place. I'd actually like to try ballet. You dance often?
877751454982746113 2017-06-21 04:53:49 UTC <bcolinstacy> Diet and exercise ?
877751400549175296 2017-06-21 04:53:36 UTC <bcolinstacy> Whoa, that's great ! Was the weight loss a segue into training ?
877751087322718209 2017-06-21 04:52:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> @vjmfilms @vjmfights My adrenaline is pumping just thinking of the mystery of it all. Where did that first one land on you ?

877747695745617922 2017-06-21 04:38:53 UTC <bcolinstacy> @FCardamenis None of this surprises me ! I usually consider you the smartest guy in the room.

877741942922260480 2017-06-21 04:16:01 UTC <bcolinstacy> @bronco7732 That last part blindsided me. Was not expecting that.
877741469896921088 2017-06-21 04:14:08 UTC <bcolinstacy> @vjmfights @vjmfilms I've always wanted to take up boxing (or ballet) so maybe this is the motivation I need to finally give it a whirl

875200267268096000 2017-06-14 03:56:18 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley @bjorkswandress I agree that we're arguing about clickbait that should've never been written. And that there should be more female-led films.

875177819667660800 2017-06-14 02:27:06 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley Banks's glib performative hyperbole during a public address isn't the same as Binoche doing the legwork behind the scenes and mentioning it
875176990856409089 2017-06-14 02:23:49 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley Yes, there should be more female-centric movies. Yes, a lot of male directors make male-centric movies.
875176659846090752 2017-06-14 02:22:30 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley There's a lot being conflated into a single issue here.
875176208408772608 2017-06-14 02:20:42 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley @bjorkswandress Also, why arbitrarily single out Spielberg? He's produced plenty of projects with female leads. What mandate does he have to direct them?
875175384211443712 2017-06-14 02:17:26 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley "...he's never made a movie with a female lead." That's what she said.

856322614230482948 2017-04-23 01:43:15 UTC <bcolinstacy> Life-changing virginal screenings of the last few years (on film, in a theater): MCCABE, BARRY LYNDON, DUNE, THE PHILADELPHIA STORY,
856321517776506886 2017-04-23 01:38:54 UTC <bcolinstacy> So I get to catch up on the "classics" oftentimes in a theater, occasionally on film, and at a wiser age. I'll gladly take that.
856321134719062016 2017-04-23 01:37:22 UTC <bcolinstacy> Moving to Dallas 6 years ago was an enlightenment. Almost of my serious film viewing (& subsq writing) began in 2013 when I was 24.
856319791942033408 2017-04-23 01:32:02 UTC <bcolinstacy> Any ciniphilia came from cruising the video store, watching Vh1 and MTV, reading Spin and Rolling Stone, and your basic millennial canon
856319096354463744 2017-04-23 01:29:16 UTC <bcolinstacy> I grew up in rural MS where there was a single 4-screen theater within 60+ miles. Grew up never having seen a B&W film (that I can remember)

855619770141552640 2017-04-21 03:10:24 UTC <bcolinstacy> You know what cultural product is ripe for a good meme or two? There's A Wocket In My Pocket
855524226270453760 2017-04-21 20:50:45 UTC <bcolinstacy> @newbeverly So hey, I'm planning a trip to LA for the Elaine retro. Could I bring some shirts to sell at the screenings???
855477286648336384 2017-04-21 17:44:13 UTC <bcolinstacy> @ManiLazic @atalvareo Soderbergh? Yes! He was hanging at the theater bar afterward. No one seemed to know who he was so I went up to him and chatted him up a bit
855476553974730753 2017-04-21 17:41:19 UTC <bcolinstacy> @ManiLazic @atalvareo I met him at this film's test screening in TX (that encounter birthed the Elaine tee)
855307116239769601 2017-04-20 06:28:02 UTC <bcolinstacy> @TyleKurner R u alive or dead ?
855305802948595712 2017-04-20 06:22:48 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday It makes so much sense right! Once I locate the track name I'll let you know
855305640427700224 2017-04-20 06:22:10 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday So far it's not. I'm kinda biting it off piece by piece. This is one I'd rather just watch again and talk it out over drinks, not write on
855305299871145984 2017-04-20 06:20:48 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday The whole skeptic medium is great on her.   Oh, did you know the song that plays over the harness scene is a Marlene Dietrich track?
855304797452328960 2017-04-20 06:18:49 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday Puzzling over how to approach a synopsis for a review I'm writing lol
855304589096046592 2017-04-20 06:17:59 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday Oh me too
855304555591999488 2017-04-20 06:17:51 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday Stewart handles textiles with such force and aggression.
855304379674402816 2017-04-20 06:17:09 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday Yes!! That harness was kind of amazing. I love how charged Assayas makes the material world.

848757038175981568 2017-04-02 04:40:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> @mimbale films within the genre. Basically, I want your book.
848756827823251457 2017-04-02 04:39:31 UTC <bcolinstacy> @mimbale been easily proven. I'm writing on two films I saw at Dallas Film Fest this week and it got me thinking if there were any singularly male
848756552567795712 2017-04-02 04:38:25 UTC <bcolinstacy> @mimbale Lucky me, LH is playing DFW soon (and on 35!), so I'll soon know myself. I think your point that this is essentially a feminine genre has
848755633935527937 2017-04-02 04:34:46 UTC <bcolinstacy> @trillmoregirls glad too count on u nathan
848755411087970304 2017-04-02 04:33:53 UTC <bcolinstacy> @swen_ryan I need to see LH, but exactly, not so much multiple personas within a single entity as it is the slippage of persons between/amongst another
848753840677670913 2017-04-02 04:27:39 UTC <bcolinstacy> @salesonfilm I need to see this to confirm
848753721123188736 2017-04-02 04:27:10 UTC <bcolinstacy> @swen_ryan Saw 2 films at Dallas Film Fest this week that play in the genre and got me thinking on its uniqueness to the female experience.
848753466742894592 2017-04-02 04:26:10 UTC <bcolinstacy> @swen_ryan That fluidity is essentially feminine.
848753333007470593 2017-04-02 04:25:38 UTC <bcolinstacy> @swen_ryan A lot I haven't seen either but you maybe right. Which is my point overall. Miriam's article talks about this as an uniquely fem genre.

845252812544069634 2017-03-24 12:35:49 UTC <bcolinstacy> Malick will be the first to incorporate 360 video in a feature
845252151920246785 2017-03-24 12:33:11 UTC <bcolinstacy> It's literally spiritual filmmaking: his camera mimicking a primordial/cosmic/metaphysical Presence. Everything must be recorded, i.e. seen
845251654500995072 2017-03-24 12:31:13 UTC <bcolinstacy> Re: ur-textshis every shot/edit implies an Image preexisting his; living is motion/action & to capture it all the camera can't be still

845154113457348608 2017-03-23 06:03:37 UTC <bcolinstacy> This review will be me kicking against finding the Bible story which to attach this to. Malick's writing ur-texts for a new cinema

843867319235436544 2017-03-20 16:50:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> (I'm writing a scene analysis on the film. Skipping that damn fine oner in the soccer stadium for the moment it tips political.)
843866887217987584 2017-03-20 16:48:38 UTC <bcolinstacy> THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES is Fincher material. Campanella does good by it with his interpersonal epic, novelistic, pseudo-moralist approach.
843866070989635584 2017-03-20 16:45:24 UTC <bcolinstacy> L&O:SVU, House, a single episode of 30 Rockthere's good form here. The film is pure soapy melodramatic schlock, and quite good.
843865539671969793 2017-03-20 16:43:17 UTC <bcolinstacy> Best thing about THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES (09) is that Campanella conflates all his mid-aughts TV work into a singular cinematic syntax

842567086098518016 2017-03-16 02:43:42 UTC <bcolinstacy> @lauren_wilford but you should, I'd rather read yours
842566629250818048 2017-03-16 02:41:53 UTC <bcolinstacy> @lauren_wilford I have a phone full of notes with names of nouvelle vague script girls
842566531708043264 2017-03-16 02:41:29 UTC <bcolinstacy> @lauren_wilford STOP
842566141264510976 2017-03-16 02:39:56 UTC <bcolinstacy> Screw it, this is my favorite film of last year
842565991020335106 2017-03-16 02:39:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> This is how I become a curmudgeon
842565913870307328 2017-03-16 02:39:02 UTC <bcolinstacy> Your birth year movie lists have overwhelmed with the potentials of unadulterated youth, which I see eroding away more with each second
842565158090215427 2017-03-16 02:36:02 UTC <bcolinstacy> And Louis C.K. is a genius.
842565090943684612 2017-03-16 02:35:46 UTC <bcolinstacy> Edie Falco's performance is literally a miracle.
842565004264161281 2017-03-16 02:35:25 UTC <bcolinstacy> Updated: I'm dead.
842564910492147712 2017-03-16 02:35:03 UTC <bcolinstacy> @shinbowi3 EXACTLY! I don't get it either. Bleh. One day, one day
842556365012910082 2017-03-16 02:01:06 UTC <bcolinstacy> @labuzamovies Oh totally! I get that. They didn't even entertain the idea tho. Hell I'd do it whenever. Just would be nice to be heard out.
842555971155230720 2017-03-16 01:59:32 UTC <bcolinstacy> @shinbowi3 which is why my long term goal is to open a rep theater in the mid cities before I die
842555851030351872 2017-03-16 01:59:03 UTC <bcolinstacy> @shinbowi3 w/the possibility of a q&a. they hardly blinked at it, gave me 1 single date. I hate it cause that's all we got other than Alam*
842555450671452160 2017-03-16 01:57:28 UTC <bcolinstacy> @shinbowi3 they program so niche/garbage that it alienates much of the rich cinephilia here. I tried to schedule a Schrader retro last year
842555130587348993 2017-03-16 01:56:11 UTC <bcolinstacy> @shinbowi3 when I complained they said they couldn't do anything about it. Half the subtitles were unreadable.
842554959942111236 2017-03-16 01:55:31 UTC <bcolinstacy> @shinbowi3 the screen is kinda trash and it's quite dingy, which they seem to dig. Saw FOX & HIS FRIENDS there last year in wrong ratio
842554728563249152 2017-03-16 01:54:35 UTC <bcolinstacy> @shinbowi3 I've had better times there (granted any rep theater was a revelation for me coming from MS) but I generally agree
842554124168318976 2017-03-16 01:52:11 UTC <bcolinstacy> @5thavecinema @EddieMarsAttack @danyomolloy it's fantastic!
842550202510794753 2017-03-16 01:36:36 UTC <bcolinstacy> @shinbowi3 yah
842549120783073280 2017-03-16 01:32:18 UTC <bcolinstacy> But ISHTAR won't sell they say
842548278403194880 2017-03-16 01:28:58 UTC <bcolinstacy> You'd think after all my hubbub the local rep cinema would at least show some interest in my idea for an Elaine May retro. That'd be nice.

839200441753821184 2017-03-07 19:45:51 UTC <bcolinstacy> This last year I experienced a sort of cataclysm, fueled by Buuel, De Palma, Ferrara, Godard, Varda, Fassbinder, Lynch.
839199091892633600 2017-03-07 19:40:29 UTC <bcolinstacy> Cinema deconstructed that bad belief and gave me a fuller, healthier vision of what it means to *be* a body. Form redeemed my theology.
839198356966682624 2017-03-07 19:37:34 UTC <bcolinstacy> I grew up in Deep South evangelicalism and was fed a malformed, nonexistent, gnostic theology of sexuality and the body. "Bodies are bad."https://twitter.com/bcolinstacy/status/839148466496471041

839184601629278208 2017-03-07 18:42:54 UTC <bcolinstacy> @daniel_fidler I did I did. Interested in what your conversation was about
839183484111450112 2017-03-07 18:38:28 UTC <bcolinstacy> My last two years of writing/watching have been a personal reckoning with the paradigm that informed this piece:http://moviemezzanine.com/rosie-huntington-whiteley-mad-max-essay/
839162923675226113 2017-03-07 17:16:46 UTC <bcolinstacy> Now, let's talk Armond and GET OUT...
839162351341486080 2017-03-07 17:14:30 UTC <bcolinstacy> Therefore empathy is not the purest yield in cinema.
839162057983406088 2017-03-07 17:13:20 UTC <bcolinstacy> Actually, what I'm saying is that cinema is about images and meaning as we know them being reconstituted. You never just look.
839161302249574401 2017-03-07 17:10:19 UTC <bcolinstacy> @labuzamovies @melvillmatic you guyses 
839161124150984704 2017-03-07 17:09:37 UTC <bcolinstacy> @labuzamovies what have you seen?
839160697594470400 2017-03-07 17:07:55 UTC <bcolinstacy> @afterglow2046 too much modern/pop criticism finds its notions of "good" art in that blasted Ebert quotation
839160280500273156 2017-03-07 17:06:16 UTC <bcolinstacy> @afterglow2046 I think the two are too often conflated, esp in crit. Many are quick to see compassion in film and qualify it as empathetic
839156847705731072 2017-03-07 16:52:37 UTC <bcolinstacy> I guess I'm just saying that looking at things is a strange and wonderful and complicated thing to do.
839156316769824771 2017-03-07 16:50:31 UTC <bcolinstacy> We all construct meaning, filmmakers just do so most blantantly making them easy targets for our own guilt and discomfort.
839155735531487233 2017-03-07 16:48:12 UTC <bcolinstacy> and form of the world and its natural images/objects. Film begs a certain social imagination, one malleable thus teachable.
839155364507561984 2017-03-07 16:46:44 UTC <bcolinstacy> Which brings me back to the slippery work of image-making and objectification. The good thinker is a good critic, able to discern the shape
839155068528123904 2017-03-07 16:45:33 UTC <bcolinstacy> not all film need be compassionate or kind even. Aggressive/transgressive cinema can make you better able to understand worth and meaning.
839154452892422151 2017-03-07 16:43:06 UTC <bcolinstacy> a righteous work, and we righteous for noticing. Maybe the higher notion is embeddedness. Empathy implies compassion;
839153948581838848 2017-03-07 16:41:06 UTC <bcolinstacy> This gets into a certain discomfort I have with our romance with the notion of empathy in cinema. If we deem a film "empathetic" it becomes
839153376424251392 2017-03-07 16:38:50 UTC <bcolinstacy> the form imposes itself upon our own selves. It's a fickle conversation between us and film, and it's absolutely essential.
839152983803842562 2017-03-07 16:37:16 UTC <bcolinstacy> The fluidity of opinion with which we approach individual films and their makers is because the reconstitution that lies at the center of
839152719973793792 2017-03-07 16:36:13 UTC <bcolinstacy> things and beings which have worth/meaning before they step in front of an artist's camera. Hardly are the lines delineated.
839152322567684096 2017-03-07 16:34:39 UTC <bcolinstacy> It's easy to get entangled by this schema because filmmakers are essentially mini-gods: imposing their own psychology and meanings upon
839150822613266435 2017-03-07 16:28:41 UTC <bcolinstacy> @labuzamovies you are a major influence here
839150538277208064 2017-03-07 16:27:33 UTC <bcolinstacy> @labuzamovies been sitting on this for awhile. RWF, Buuel, and Ferrara have been cataclysmic for me
839150001855004673 2017-03-07 16:25:25 UTC <bcolinstacy> @JeremyMDoan soon enough I imagine. He, Buuel, De Palma, Ferrara, and Godard have really done a number on me.
839148575682592771 2017-03-07 16:19:45 UTC <bcolinstacy> There's a memoir in here somewhere.
839148466496471041 2017-03-07 16:19:19 UTC <bcolinstacy> I blame a certain half-formed religious/theological staunchness on my ignorance; cinema/criticism has liberated much of that wrongheadedness
839147562808524800 2017-03-07 16:15:44 UTC <bcolinstacy> And, though I'm only two films into his oeuvre, it seems to make up the very constitution of Fassbinder's cinema.
839147357346402305 2017-03-07 16:14:55 UTC <bcolinstacy> our perception of physical realitybodies more so than anything. This is the thesis of JLG's 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER.
839146947646795783 2017-03-07 16:13:17 UTC <bcolinstacy> A film's construction (narratively, thematically, aesthetically, etc.) is a theater for the de-then-reconstruction of
839146146853490688 2017-03-07 16:10:06 UTC <bcolinstacy> Objectification literally is image-makingcapturing bodies, things, pieces, masses and reassserting them as objects.
839145724629684225 2017-03-07 16:08:25 UTC <bcolinstacy> In my days of ignorance, I'd assert that humans shouldn't be objectified by mise-en-scene, but bodies *are* things making that impossible.
839144626049191936 2017-03-07 16:04:04 UTC <bcolinstacy> RWF composes my favorite compositions: simple, narrow frames whose meaning is found where the matte-Technicolor construction is obstructed

837170249879465988 2017-03-01 05:18:36 UTC <bcolinstacy> @DMosesGriffin Greene's sense of texture and environment. Anyway, that's all I got rn
837170094182699010 2017-03-01 05:17:58 UTC <bcolinstacy> @DMosesGriffin was welcome but hardly substantial. Have you read The Power and the Glory? I kept going back to that as I was reading, needed
837169888749883393 2017-03-01 05:17:09 UTC <bcolinstacy> @DMosesGriffin it's redundancies are better in Scorsese's images than in the prose. I craved another perspective. The shift from 1st to 3rd
837169558830084096 2017-03-01 05:15:51 UTC <bcolinstacy> @DMosesGriffin it read really flat. That breeziness I talked about recently didn't help. It's all very descriptive, and simple

837167228718092291 2017-03-01 05:06:35 UTC <bcolinstacy> @JeremyMDoan but really, have you read it? Had difficulty divorcing it from its intertext, Greene's The Power and the Glory

826188418375876609 2017-01-30 22:00:43 UTC <bcolinstacy> I don't know what the vision is or how to implement it, but the next few weeks I dedicate to research. If you can contribute, please do. 10/
826187938295857152 2017-01-30 21:58:48 UTC <bcolinstacy> I want to see and feel and hear Somali, Sudanese, Iraqi, Egyptian, Libyan, Syrian, etc. cinema. 9/

817989263707009024 2017-01-07 07:00:12 UTC <bcolinstacy> like I love Old Hollywood so much but it's ancient and the movies blow up so let's just leave ie THEY DONT LOVE MOVIES
817986278943760385 2017-01-07 06:48:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> Chazelle scripting that print of REBEL combusting mid-screening in LA LA LAND feels hilariously self-negating
817985417333145601 2017-01-07 06:44:55 UTC <bcolinstacy> @Camera_Angel I'd love to read your case for it!
817984489586589696 2017-01-07 06:41:14 UTC <bcolinstacy> @Camera_Angel I saw it having a single idea with a host threads in, found that quite tedious pretty early on. Did you write/pcast abt it?

817976820490502144 2017-01-07 06:10:45 UTC <bcolinstacy> I bet Marty and Ridley had just got out a screening of LA LA LAND when they told us cinema was dead
817976583977926656 2017-01-07 06:09:49 UTC <bcolinstacy> Don Draper killed cinemahttps://twitter.com/mossgardenfilm/status/813882094048935937

817972646629543936 2017-01-07 05:54:10 UTC <bcolinstacy> @willow_catelyn the disaffection/anti-charisma it goes for damns the whole affair
817972414680354816 2017-01-07 05:53:15 UTC <bcolinstacy> @willow_catelyn right there w/you. WL is assured, tight. LLL is ridiculously bland, staid, soulless. I've never hated steadicam so much
817965466924814340 2017-01-07 05:25:39 UTC <bcolinstacy> @willow_catelyn yeah okay geez it's not very good. Chazelle is anemic

815312214026489859 2016-12-31 21:42:34 UTC <bcolinstacy> @ManiLazic @TheFilmStage your BD piece is one of the better things I read this year
815311760731340800 2016-12-31 21:40:46 UTC <bcolinstacy> @SeanMBurns what's a dane cook
815311432237666304 2016-12-31 21:39:27 UTC <bcolinstacy> That rendition of "Unchained Melody" playing as THINGS TO COME ends is my favorite moment in film all year
815305392171446272 2016-12-31 21:15:27 UTC <bcolinstacy> Actually, gonna rewatch bits of THINGS TO COME before my screener expires.
815305140550955008 2016-12-31 21:14:27 UTC <bcolinstacy> @skeltonia I think ur onto something
815304956702027776 2016-12-31 21:13:43 UTC <bcolinstacy> Such a great movie dad. That cut from "What *do* you want?" after the cash offer to the wedding is an all-timer
815303929064001537 2016-12-31 21:09:38 UTC <bcolinstacy> @kipjmooney I'm really excited for it still!! Despite the haterz
815303815192788992 2016-12-31 21:09:11 UTC <bcolinstacy> @skeltonia Jeannie Berlin is tops. One of cinema's finest women-scorned 
815303692052217857 2016-12-31 21:08:42 UTC <bcolinstacy> @skeltonia and you were the one that sent me the link! I just now finally got to it. Bless you child.

815293965557698561 2016-12-31 20:30:03 UTC <bcolinstacy> First time attempting to write about a short film and Akerman. Something on LA CHAMBRE: http://boxd.it/9aj6j
815293598501584896 2016-12-31 20:28:35 UTC <bcolinstacy> But really, this is my best work of the year. INLAND EMPIRE as Lynch's adaptation of GOODNIGHT MOON: http://boxd.it/8M6SV
815293128617971720 2016-12-31 20:26:43 UTC <bcolinstacy> Really wanted to write more on HAIL, CAESAR!, my favorite film of the year, but I never got to it. http://boxd.it/8yNWX
815291487483207680 2016-12-31 20:20:12 UTC <bcolinstacy> @j_christley @womensrites what he does with that awshucks-ness is low key brilliant
815291158008098816 2016-12-31 20:18:54 UTC <bcolinstacy> Forgot I'd written this about CAROL earlier in the year. Undeniably one of the best of this decade.http://boxd.it/8qtPr
815289603674570752 2016-12-31 20:12:43 UTC <bcolinstacy> @womensrites he's achingly good

815039430088151040 2016-12-30 03:38:37 UTC <bcolinstacy> I can think of at least four years out of human history that were worse than 2016. Let's not be histrionic.

814988857917706244 2016-12-30 00:17:40 UTC <bcolinstacy> @erinprovolone this is the correct reaction

814849324022697985 2016-12-30 15:03:12 UTC <bcolinstacy> THE HEARTBREAK KID is totally Elaine May remaking Agnes Varda's LE BONHEUR

814672304005410816 2016-12-29 03:19:47 UTC <bcolinstacy> Hot discussion of JACKIE over at the Facebook last night and into today  (I severely dislike it and find it mind-numbingly miscalculated)
814667434426822656 2016-12-29 03:00:26 UTC <bcolinstacy> Grodin is the world's biggest shitheel in THE HEARTBREAK KID. Elaine really knows the male species; her films hurt.

814537412315672576 2016-12-29 18:23:47 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday Interested in what you'll think. I feel our criticism of K could apply wholesale to this one too. It was laborious.
814535965477900288 2016-12-29 18:18:02 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday Do you plan to see JACKIE?
814535804081111040 2016-12-29 18:17:23 UTC <bcolinstacy> @erinprovolone @paolocase I read somewhere their periods attract books. Books can smell the menstruation.
814535406872121345 2016-12-29 18:15:48 UTC <bcolinstacy> @erinprovolone @paolocase Go book yourself, San Diego
814535226881929218 2016-12-29 18:15:06 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday I do hope so, maybe from a script he didn't write.
814534455511674880 2016-12-29 18:12:02 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday YES! Exactly my thoughts. She's a great actress.
814534298762153984 2016-12-29 18:11:24 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday K is just one single flat note pounded incessantly. Cassavetes forms dense emotional interpersonal arcs.
814533969026940928 2016-12-29 18:10:06 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday Silly, easy cinephilia imo. Cassavetes-brand miserablism is at least rooted in meditative, multi-faceted scenarios.
814533090651598848 2016-12-29 18:06:36 UTC <bcolinstacy> @erinprovolone @paolocase Book [sic] was a bad choice!

814531991790043136 2016-12-29 18:02:14 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday and oof, all those Cassavetes comparisons are very far off base
814531812970139652 2016-12-29 18:01:32 UTC <bcolinstacy> @oneaprilday Agreed! Miserable and strained to the point it gets nasty. And that damned turkey drop is my most frustrating scene of the year

814484218487144448 2016-12-29 14:52:24 UTC <bcolinstacy> I haven't seen LA LA LAND but that it would receive such a certain cinephiled ire while JACKIE floats by unscathed is a travesty

814170095811522561 2016-12-28 18:04:12 UTC <bcolinstacy> Don't love that Michelle Williams has fallen into the typecasting rut of a mother whose kids befall tragic ends under her watch

813761692157050880 2016-12-27 15:01:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> ROGUE ONE's ending is audacious the way Trump's "we're gunna say merry xmas again" schtick is; foreknowledge, a downfall

811436485807378432 2016-12-20 05:01:48 UTC <bcolinstacy> @mimbale Certainly! I think it's the much better OJ offering this year.
811435847841148928 2016-12-20 04:59:16 UTC <bcolinstacy> @mimbale Glad there's another thinking through it this way. The adoration is stifling. Were you able to catch the miniseries on FX?

811435107202568192 2016-12-20 04:56:19 UTC <bcolinstacy> @mimbale I think OJ's latter days give a true picture of the grotesquerie, the tragedy. A deep focus there avoids the rote construct
811434492523085824 2016-12-20 04:53:53 UTC <bcolinstacy> @mimbale Yeah, that's what I'm getting at. Textbooks aren't bad, just...redundant, surface. A more erudite text can do this in avg runtime
811433511089541120 2016-12-20 04:49:59 UTC <bcolinstacy> That said: send best reviews/essays/pieces on ELLE. I found it to be a very studious, apt vision of modern social constructs.
811432984385556480 2016-12-20 04:47:53 UTC <bcolinstacy> I wasn't expecting this, but I'm finding it much easier to love L'AVENIR over ELLE. (I like em both.)

809420435540611072 2016-12-15 15:30:44 UTC <bcolinstacy> The more apt Welles film to cite concerning the Trumps is THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. Trust me, he won't end like ol' Charles Foster did.

801607791983083525 2016-11-23 02:06:05 UTC <bcolinstacy> @TheAlanNoble I won a 4th grade drawing competition drawing DBZ characters in a straight 2D row.
801606346382725120 2016-11-23 02:00:20 UTC <bcolinstacy> @faceyouhate @FookThis I actually agree.
801605994442870784 2016-11-23 01:58:56 UTC <bcolinstacy> @faceyouhate @FookThis I've only seen it and SUSPIRIA and like it better. The kind of bonkers I favor. And one of the greatest endings!
801604588575096832 2016-11-23 01:53:21 UTC <bcolinstacy> @FookThis @faceyouhate But OPERA is so very good.
